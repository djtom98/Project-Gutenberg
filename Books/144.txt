If you persist,\r\nlawyers\xe2\x80\x99 clerks will have to make flying leaps into the mud; young lady\r\ntypists will have to fidget behind you. In the streets of London where\r\nbeauty goes unregarded, eccentricity must pay the penalty, and it is\r\nbetter not to be very tall, to wear a long blue cloak, or to beat the\r\nair with your left hand.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon in the beginning of October when the traffic was becoming\r\nbrisk a tall man strode along the edge of the pavement with a lady on\r\nhis arm. Angry glances struck upon their backs. The small, agitated\r\nfigures\xe2\x80\x94for in comparison with this couple most people looked\r\nsmall\xe2\x80\x94decorated with fountain pens, and burdened with despatch-boxes,\r\nhad appointments to keep, and drew a weekly salary, so that there was\r\nsome reason for the unfriendly stare which was bestowed upon Mr.\r\nAmbrose\xe2\x80\x99s height and upon Mrs. Ambrose\xe2\x80\x99s cloak. But some enchantment\r\nhad put both man and woman beyond the reach of malice and unpopularity.\r\nIn his case one might guess from the moving lips that it was thought;\r\nand in hers from the eyes fixed stonily straight in front of her at a\r\nlevel above the eyes of most that it was sorrow. It was only by\r\nscorning all she met that she kept herself from tears, and the friction\r\nof people brushing past her was evidently painful. After watching the\r\ntraffic on the Embankment for a minute or two with a stoical gaze she\r\ntwitched her husband\xe2\x80\x99s sleeve, and they crossed between the swift\r\ndischarge of motor cars. When they were safe on the further side, she\r\ngently withdrew her arm from his, allowing her mouth at the same time\r\nto relax, to tremble; then tears rolled down, and leaning her elbows on\r\nthe balustrade, she shielded her face from the curious. Mr. Ambrose\r\nattempted consolation; he patted her shoulder; but she showed no signs\r\nof admitting him, and feeling it awkward to stand beside a grief that\r\nwas greater than his, he crossed his arms behind him, and took a turn\r\nalong the pavement.\r\n\r\nThe embankment juts out in angles here and there, like pulpits; instead\r\nof preachers, however, small boys occupy them, dangling string,\r\ndropping pebbles, or launching wads of paper for a cruise. With their\r\nsharp eye for eccentricity, they were inclined to think Mr. Ambrose\r\nawful; but the quickest witted cried \xe2\x80\x9cBluebeard!\xe2\x80\x9d as he passed. In case\r\nthey should proceed to tease his wife, Mr. Ambrose flourished his stick\r\nat them, upon which they decided that he was grotesque merely, and four\r\ninstead of one cried \xe2\x80\x9cBluebeard!\xe2\x80\x9d in chorus.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mrs. Ambrose stood quite still, much longer than is natural,\r\nthe little boys let her be. Some one is always looking into the river\r\nnear Waterloo Bridge; a couple will stand there talking for half an\r\nhour on a fine afternoon; most people, walking for pleasure,\r\ncontemplate for three minutes; when, having compared the occasion with\r\nother occasions, or made some sentence, they pass on. Sometimes the\r\nflats and churches and hotels of Westminster are like the outlines of\r\nConstantinople in a mist; sometimes the river is an opulent purple,\r\nsometimes mud-coloured, sometimes sparkling blue like the sea. It is\r\nalways worth while to look down and see what is happening. But this\r\nlady looked neither up nor down; the only thing she had seen, since she\r\nstood there, was a circular iridescent patch slowly floating past with\r\na straw in the middle of it. The straw and the patch swam again and\r\nagain behind the tremulous medium of a great welling tear, and the tear\r\nrose and fell and dropped into the river. Then there struck close upon\r\nher ears\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nLars Porsena of Clusium\r\nBy the nine Gods he swore\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\nand then more faintly, as if the speaker had passed her on his walk\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThat the Great House of Tarquin\r\nShould suffer wrong no more.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, she knew she must go back to all that, but at present she must\r\nweep. Screening her face she sobbed more steadily than she had yet\r\ndone, her shoulders rising and falling with great regularity. It was\r\nthis figure that her husband saw when, having reached the polished\r\nSphinx, having entangled himself with a man selling picture postcards,\r\nhe turned; the stanza instantly stopped. He came up to her, laid his\r\nhand on her shoulder, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cDearest.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice was supplicating.\r\nBut she shut her face away from him, as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npossibly understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he did not leave her, however, she had to wipe her eyes, and to\r\nraise them to the level of the factory chimneys on the other bank. She\r\nsaw also the arches of Waterloo Bridge and the carts moving across\r\nthem, like the line of animals in a shooting gallery. They were seen\r\nblankly, but to see anything was of course to end her weeping and begin\r\nto walk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather walk,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, her husband having hailed a cab\r\nalready occupied by two city men.\r\n\r\nThe fixity of her mood was broken by the action of walking. The\r\nshooting motor cars, more like spiders in the moon than terrestrial\r\nobjects, the thundering drays, the jingling hansoms, and little black\r\nbroughams, made her think of the world she lived in. Somewhere up there\r\nabove the pinnacles where the smoke rose in a pointed hill, her\r\nchildren were now asking for her, and getting a soothing reply. As for\r\nthe mass of streets, squares, and public buildings which parted them,\r\nshe only felt at this moment how little London had done to make her\r\nlove it, although thirty of her forty years had been spent in a street.\r\nShe knew how to read the people who were passing her; there were the\r\nrich who were running to and from each others\xe2\x80\x99 houses at this hour;\r\nthere were the bigoted workers driving in a straight line to their\r\noffices; there were the poor who were unhappy and rightly malignant.\r\nAlready, though there was sunlight in the haze, tattered old men and\r\nwomen were nodding off to sleep upon the seats. When one gave up seeing\r\nthe beauty that clothed things, this was the skeleton beneath.\r\n\r\nA fine rain now made her still more dismal; vans with the odd names of\r\nthose engaged in odd industries\xe2\x80\x94Sprules, Manufacturer of Saw-dust;\r\nGrabb, to whom no piece of waste paper comes amiss\xe2\x80\x94fell flat as a bad\r\njoke; bold lovers, sheltered behind one cloak, seemed to her sordid,\r\npast their passion; the flower women, a contented company, whose talk\r\nis always worth hearing, were sodden hags; the red, yellow, and blue\r\nflowers, whose heads were pressed together, would not blaze. Moreover,\r\nher husband walking with a quick rhythmic stride, jerking his free hand\r\noccasionally, was either a Viking or a stricken Nelson; the sea-gulls\r\nhad changed his note.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRidley, shall we drive? Shall we drive, Ridley?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Ambrose had to speak sharply; by this time he was far away.\r\n\r\nThe cab, by trotting steadily along the same road, soon withdrew them\r\nfrom the West End, and plunged them into London. It appeared that this\r\nwas a great manufacturing place, where the people were engaged in\r\nmaking things, as though the West End, with its electric lamps, its\r\nvast plate-glass windows all shining yellow, its carefully-finished\r\nhouses, and tiny live figures trotting on the pavement, or bowled along\r\non wheels in the road, was the finished work. It appeared to her a very\r\nsmall bit of work for such an enormous factory to have made. For some\r\nreason it appeared to her as a small golden tassel on the edge of a\r\nvast black cloak.\r\n\r\nObserving that they passed no other hansom cab, but only vans and\r\nwaggons, and that not one of the thousand men and women she saw was\r\neither a gentleman or a lady, Mrs. Ambrose understood that after all it\r\nis the ordinary thing to be poor, and that London is the city of\r\ninnumerable poor people. Startled by this discovery and seeing herself\r\npacing a circle all the days of her life round Picadilly Circus she was\r\ngreatly relieved to pass a building put up by the London County Council\r\nfor Night Schools.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, how gloomy it is!\xe2\x80\x9d her husband groaned. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor creatures!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat with the misery for her children, the poor, and the rain, her mind\r\nwas like a wound exposed to dry in the air.\r\n\r\nAt this point the cab stopped, for it was in danger of being crushed\r\nlike an egg-shell. The wide Embankment which had had room for\r\ncannonballs and squadrons, had now shrunk to a cobbled lane steaming\r\nwith smells of malt and oil and blocked by waggons. While her husband\r\nread the placards pasted on the brick announcing the hours at which\r\ncertain ships would sail for Scotland, Mrs. Ambrose did her best to\r\nfind information. From a world exclusively occupied in feeding waggons\r\nwith sacks, half obliterated too in a fine yellow fog, they got neither\r\nhelp nor attention. It seemed a miracle when an old man approached,\r\nguessed their condition, and proposed to row them out to their ship in\r\nthe little boat which he kept moored at the bottom of a flight of\r\nsteps. With some hesitation they trusted themselves to him, took their\r\nplaces, and were soon waving up and down upon the water, London having\r\nshrunk to two lines of buildings on either side of them, square\r\nbuildings and oblong buildings placed in rows like a child\xe2\x80\x99s avenue of\r\nbricks.\r\n\r\nThe river, which had a certain amount of troubled yellow light in it,\r\nran with great force; bulky barges floated down swiftly escorted by\r\ntugs; police boats shot past everything; the wind went with the\r\ncurrent. The open rowing-boat in which they sat bobbed and curtseyed\r\nacross the line of traffic. In mid-stream the old man stayed his hands\r\nupon the oars, and as the water rushed past them, remarked that once he\r\nhad taken many passengers across, where now he took scarcely any. He\r\nseemed to recall an age when his boat, moored among rushes, carried\r\ndelicate feet across to lawns at Rotherhithe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey want bridges now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, indicating the monstrous outline of\r\nthe Tower Bridge. Mournfully Helen regarded him, who was putting water\r\nbetween her and her children. Mournfully she gazed at the ship they\r\nwere approaching; anchored in the middle of the stream they could dimly\r\nread her name\xe2\x80\x94_Euphrosyne_.\r\n\r\nVery dimly in the falling dusk they could see the lines of the rigging,\r\nthe masts and the dark flag which the breeze blew out squarely behind.\r\n\r\nAs the little boat sidled up to the steamer, and the old man shipped\r\nhis oars, he remarked once more pointing above, that ships all the\r\nworld over flew that flag the day they sailed. In the minds of both the\r\npassengers the blue flag appeared a sinister token, and this the moment\r\nfor presentiments, but nevertheless they rose, gathered their things\r\ntogether, and climbed on deck.\r\n\r\nDown in the saloon of her father\xe2\x80\x99s ship, Miss Rachel Vinrace, aged\r\ntwenty-four, stood waiting her uncle and aunt nervously. To begin with,\r\nthough nearly related, she scarcely remembered them; to go on with,\r\nthey were elderly people, and finally, as her father\xe2\x80\x99s daughter she\r\nmust be in some sort prepared to entertain them. She looked forward to\r\nseeing them as civilised people generally look forward to the first\r\nsight of civilised people, as though they were of the nature of an\r\napproaching physical discomfort\xe2\x80\x94a tight shoe or a draughty window. She\r\nwas already unnaturally braced to receive them. As she occupied herself\r\nin laying forks severely straight by the side of knives, she heard a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s voice saying gloomily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn a dark night one would fall down these stairs head foremost,\xe2\x80\x9d to\r\nwhich a woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice added, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd be killed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she spoke the last words the woman stood in the doorway. Tall,\r\nlarge-eyed, draped in purple shawls, Mrs. Ambrose was romantic and\r\nbeautiful; not perhaps sympathetic, for her eyes looked straight and\r\nconsidered what they saw. Her face was much warmer than a Greek face;\r\non the other hand it was much bolder than the face of the usual pretty\r\nEnglishwoman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Rachel, how d\xe2\x80\x99you do,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, shaking hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Ambrose, inclining his forehead to be\r\nkissed. His niece instinctively liked his thin angular body, and the\r\nbig head with its sweeping features, and the acute, innocent eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell Mr. Pepper,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel bade the servant. Husband and wife then sat\r\ndown on one side of the table, with their niece opposite to them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father told me to begin,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is very busy with the\r\nmen. . . . You know Mr. Pepper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA little man who was bent as some trees are by a gale on one side of\r\nthem had slipped in. Nodding to Mr. Ambrose, he shook hands with Helen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDraughts,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, erecting the collar of his coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are still rheumatic?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Helen. Her voice was low and\r\nseductive, though she spoke absently enough, the sight of town and\r\nriver being still present to her mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce rheumatic, always rheumatic, I fear,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cTo some extent\r\nit depends on the weather, though not so much as people are apt to\r\nthink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne does not die of it, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a general rule\xe2\x80\x94no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pepper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoup, Uncle Ridley?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and, as he held his plate out, sighed\r\naudibly, \xe2\x80\x9cAh! she\xe2\x80\x99s not like her mother.\xe2\x80\x9d Helen was just too late in\r\nthumping her tumbler on the table to prevent Rachel from hearing, and\r\nfrom blushing scarlet with embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe way servants treat flowers!\xe2\x80\x9d she said hastily. She drew a green\r\nvase with a crinkled lip towards her, and began pulling out the tight\r\nlittle chrysanthemums, which she laid on the table-cloth, arranging\r\nthem fastidiously side by side.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou knew Jenkinson, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you, Ambrose?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Pepper across the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJenkinson of Peterhouse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s dead,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pepper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, dear!\xe2\x80\x94I knew him\xe2\x80\x94ages ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ridley. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was the hero of the\r\npunt accident, you remember? A queer card. Married a young woman out of\r\na tobacconist\xe2\x80\x99s, and lived in the Fens\xe2\x80\x94never heard what became of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrink\xe2\x80\x94drugs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pepper with sinister conciseness. \xe2\x80\x9cHe left a\r\ncommentary. Hopeless muddle, I\xe2\x80\x99m told.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man had really great abilities,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ridley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis introduction to Jellaby holds its own still,\xe2\x80\x9d went on Mr. Pepper,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhich is surprising, seeing how text-books change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a theory about the planets, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ridley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA screw loose somewhere, no doubt of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pepper, shaking his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nNow a tremor ran through the table, and a light outside swerved. At the\r\nsame time an electric bell rang sharply again and again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ridley.\r\n\r\nA slight but perceptible wave seemed to roll beneath the floor; then it\r\nsank; then another came, more perceptible. Lights slid right across the\r\nuncurtained window. The ship gave a loud melancholy moan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re off!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pepper. Other ships, as sad as she, answered her\r\noutside on the river. The chuckling and hissing of water could be\r\nplainly heard, and the ship heaved so that the steward bringing plates\r\nhad to balance himself as he drew the curtain. There was a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJenkinson of Cats\xe2\x80\x94d\xe2\x80\x99you still keep up with him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ambrose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs much as one ever does,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pepper. \xe2\x80\x9cWe meet annually. This\r\nyear he has had the misfortune to lose his wife, which made it painful,\r\nof course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery painful,\xe2\x80\x9d Ridley agreed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s an unmarried daughter who keeps house for him, I believe, but\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s never the same, not at his age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth gentlemen nodded sagely as they carved their apples.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a book, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there?\xe2\x80\x9d Ridley enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere _was_ a book, but there never _will_ be a book,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pepper\r\nwith such fierceness that both ladies looked up at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere never will be a book, because some one else has written it for\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pepper with considerable acidity. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what comes of\r\nputting things off, and collecting fossils, and sticking Norman arches\r\non one\xe2\x80\x99s pigsties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI confess I sympathise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ridley with a melancholy sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a\r\nweakness for people who can\xe2\x80\x99t begin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c. . . The accumulations of a lifetime wasted,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. pepper.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had accumulations enough to fill a barn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a vice that some of us escape,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ridley. \xe2\x80\x9cOur friend Miles\r\nhas another work out to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Pepper gave an acid little laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cAccording to my calculations,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9che has produced two volumes and a half annually, which,\r\nallowing for time spent in the cradle and so forth, shows a commendable\r\nindustry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the old Master\xe2\x80\x99s saying of him has been pretty well realised,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Ridley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA way they had,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pepper. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know the Bruce collection?\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nfor publication, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should suppose not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ridley significantly. \xe2\x80\x9cFor a Divine he\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94remarkably free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Pump in Neville\xe2\x80\x99s Row, for example?\xe2\x80\x9d enquired Mr. Pepper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ambrose.\r\n\r\nEach of the ladies, being after the fashion of their sex, highly\r\ntrained in promoting men\xe2\x80\x99s talk without listening to it, could\r\nthink\xe2\x80\x94about the education of children, about the use of fog sirens in\r\nan opera\xe2\x80\x94without betraying herself. Only it struck Helen that Rachel\r\nwas perhaps too still for a hostess, and that she might have done\r\nsomething with her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d she said at length, upon which they rose and left, vaguely\r\nto the surprise of the gentlemen, who had either thought them attentive\r\nor had forgotten their presence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, one could tell strange stories of the old days,\xe2\x80\x9d they heard Ridley\r\nsay, as he sank into his chair again. Glancing back, at the doorway,\r\nthey saw Mr. Pepper as though he had suddenly loosened his clothes, and\r\nhad become a vivacious and malicious old ape.\r\n\r\nWinding veils round their heads, the women walked on deck. They were\r\nnow moving steadily down the river, passing the dark shapes of ships at\r\nanchor, and London was a swarm of lights with a pale yellow canopy\r\ndrooping above it. There were the lights of the great theatres, the\r\nlights of the long streets, lights that indicated huge squares of\r\ndomestic comfort, lights that hung high in air. No darkness would ever\r\nsettle upon those lamps, as no darkness had settled upon them for\r\nhundreds of years. It seemed dreadful that the town should blaze for\r\never in the same spot; dreadful at least to people going away to\r\nadventure upon the sea, and beholding it as a circumscribed mound,\r\neternally burnt, eternally scarred. From the deck of the ship the great\r\ncity appeared a crouched and cowardly figure, a sedentary miser.\r\n\r\nLeaning over the rail, side by side, Helen said, \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you be cold?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nRachel replied, \xe2\x80\x9cNo. . . . How beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d she added a moment later.\r\nVery little was visible\xe2\x80\x94a few masts, a shadow of land here, a line of\r\nbrilliant windows there. They tried to make head against the wind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt blows\xe2\x80\x94it blows!\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Rachel, the words rammed down her throat.\r\nStruggling by her side, Helen was suddenly overcome by the spirit of\r\nmovement, and pushed along with her skirts wrapping themselves round\r\nher knees, and both arms to her hair. But slowly the intoxication of\r\nmovement died down, and the wind became rough and chilly. They looked\r\nthrough a chink in the blind and saw that long cigars were being smoked\r\nin the dining-room; they saw Mr. Ambrose throw himself violently\r\nagainst the back of his chair, while Mr. Pepper crinkled his cheeks as\r\nthough they had been cut in wood. The ghost of a roar of laughter came\r\nout to them, and was drowned at once in the wind. In the dry\r\nyellow-lighted room Mr. Pepper and Mr. Ambrose were oblivious of all\r\ntumult; they were in Cambridge, and it was probably about the year\r\n1875.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re old friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen, smiling at the sight. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, is there\r\na room for us to sit in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel opened a door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s more like a landing than a room,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Indeed it had nothing\r\nof the shut stationary character of a room on shore. A table was rooted\r\nin the middle, and seats were stuck to the sides. Happily the tropical\r\nsuns had bleached the tapestries to a faded blue-green colour, and the\r\nmirror with its frame of shells, the work of the steward\xe2\x80\x99s love, when\r\nthe time hung heavy in the southern seas, was quaint rather than ugly.\r\nTwisted shells with red lips like unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s horns ornamented the\r\nmantelpiece, which was draped by a pall of purple plush from which\r\ndepended a certain number of balls. Two windows opened on to the deck,\r\nand the light beating through them when the ship was roasted on the\r\nAmazons had turned the prints on the opposite wall to a faint yellow\r\ncolour, so that \xe2\x80\x9cThe Coliseum\xe2\x80\x9d was scarcely to be distinguished from\r\nQueen Alexandra playing with her Spaniels. A pair of wicker arm-chairs\r\nby the fireside invited one to warm one\xe2\x80\x99s hands at a grate full of gilt\r\nshavings; a great lamp swung above the table\xe2\x80\x94the kind of lamp which\r\nmakes the light of civilisation across dark fields to one walking in\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s odd that every one should be an old friend of Mr. Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nRachel started nervously, for the situation was difficult, the room\r\ncold, and Helen curiously silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you take him for granted?\xe2\x80\x9d said her aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s like this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel, lighting on a fossilised fish in a\r\nbasin, and displaying it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect you\xe2\x80\x99re too severe,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen remarked.\r\n\r\nRachel immediately tried to qualify what she had said against her\r\nbelief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t really know him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and took refuge in facts,\r\nbelieving that elderly people really like them better than feelings.\r\nShe produced what she knew of William Pepper. She told Helen that he\r\nalways called on Sundays when they were at home; he knew about a great\r\nmany things\xe2\x80\x94about mathematics, history, Greek, zoology, economics, and\r\nthe Icelandic Sagas. He had turned Persian poetry into English prose,\r\nand English prose into Greek iambics; he was an authority upon coins;\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94one other thing\xe2\x80\x94oh yes, she thought it was vehicular traffic.\r\n\r\nHe was here either to get things out of the sea, or to write upon the\r\nprobable course of Odysseus, for Greek after all was his hobby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got all his pamphlets,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cLittle pamphlets. Little\r\nyellow books.\xe2\x80\x9d It did not appear that she had read them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he ever been in love?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Helen, who had chosen a seat.\r\n\r\nThis was unexpectedly to the point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis heart\xe2\x80\x99s a piece of old shoe leather,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel declared, dropping\r\nthe fish. But when questioned she had to own that she had never asked\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall ask him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe last time I saw you, you were buying a piano,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou remember\xe2\x80\x94the piano, the room in the attic, and the great plants\r\nwith the prickles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and my aunts said the piano would come through the floor, but at\r\ntheir age one wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind being killed in the night?\xe2\x80\x9d she enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard from Aunt Bessie not long ago,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen stated. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is afraid\r\nthat you will spoil your arms if you insist upon so much practising.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe muscles of the forearm\xe2\x80\x94and then one won\xe2\x80\x99t marry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t put it quite like that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Ambrose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no\xe2\x80\x94of course she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel with a sigh.\r\n\r\nHelen looked at her. Her face was weak rather than decided, saved from\r\ninsipidity by the large enquiring eyes; denied beauty, now that she was\r\nsheltered indoors, by the lack of colour and definite outline.\r\nMoreover, a hesitation in speaking, or rather a tendency to use the\r\nwrong words, made her seem more than normally incompetent for her\r\nyears. Mrs. Ambrose, who had been speaking much at random, now\r\nreflected that she certainly did not look forward to the intimacy of\r\nthree or four weeks on board ship which was threatened. Women of her\r\nown age usually boring her, she supposed that girls would be worse. She\r\nglanced at Rachel again. Yes! how clear it was that she would be\r\nvacillating, emotional, and when you said something to her it would\r\nmake no more lasting impression than the stroke of a stick upon water.\r\nThere was nothing to take hold of in girls\xe2\x80\x94nothing hard, permanent,\r\nsatisfactory. Did Willoughby say three weeks, or did he say four? She\r\ntried to remember.\r\n\r\nAt this point, however, the door opened and a tall burly man entered\r\nthe room, came forward and shook Helen\xe2\x80\x99s hand with an emotional kind of\r\nheartiness, Willoughby himself, Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s father, Helen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrother-in-law. As a great deal of flesh would have been needed to make\r\na fat man of him, his frame being so large, he was not fat; his face\r\nwas a large framework too, looking, by the smallness of the features\r\nand the glow in the hollow of the cheek, more fitted to withstand\r\nassaults of the weather than to express sentiments and emotions, or to\r\nrespond to them in others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a great pleasure that you have come,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor both of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel murmured in obedience to her father\xe2\x80\x99s glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll do our best to make you comfortable. And Ridley. We think it an\r\nhonour to have charge of him. Pepper\xe2\x80\x99ll have some one to contradict\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94which I daren\xe2\x80\x99t do. You find this child grown, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? A young\r\nwoman, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill holding Helen\xe2\x80\x99s hand he drew his arm round Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder,\r\nthus making them come uncomfortably close, but Helen forbore to look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think she does us credit?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause we expect great things of her,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, squeezing his\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s arm and releasing her. \xe2\x80\x9cBut about you now.\xe2\x80\x9d They sat down\r\nside by side on the little sofa. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you leave the children well?\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ll be ready for school, I suppose. Do they take after you or\r\nAmbrose? They\xe2\x80\x99ve got good heads on their shoulders, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this Helen immediately brightened more than she had yet done, and\r\nexplained that her son was six and her daughter ten. Everybody said\r\nthat her boy was like her and her girl like Ridley. As for brains, they\r\nwere quick brats, she thought, and modestly she ventured on a little\r\nstory about her son,\xe2\x80\x94how left alone for a minute he had taken the pat\r\nof butter in his fingers, run across the room with it, and put it on\r\nthe fire\xe2\x80\x94merely for the fun of the thing, a feeling which she could\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you had to show the young rascal that these tricks wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do,\r\neh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA child of six? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m an old-fashioned father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, Willoughby; Rachel knows better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMuch as Willoughby would doubtless have liked his daughter to praise\r\nhim she did not; her eyes were unreflecting as water, her fingers still\r\ntoying with the fossilised fish, her mind absent. The elder people went\r\non to speak of arrangements that could be made for Ridley\xe2\x80\x99s comfort\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ntable placed where he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help looking at the sea, far from\r\nboilers, at the same time sheltered from the view of people passing.\r\nUnless he made this a holiday, when his books were all packed, he would\r\nhave no holiday whatever; for out at Santa Marina Helen knew, by\r\nexperience, that he would work all day; his boxes, she said, were\r\npacked with books.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave it to me\xe2\x80\x94leave it to me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Willoughby, obviously intending\r\nto do much more than she asked of him. But Ridley and Mr. Pepper were\r\nheard fumbling at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you, Vinrace?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ridley, extending a limp hand as he came\r\nin, as though the meeting were melancholy to both, but on the whole\r\nmore so to him.\r\n\r\nWilloughby preserved his heartiness, tempered by respect. For the\r\nmoment nothing was said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe looked in and saw you laughing,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pepper had\r\njust told a very good story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPish. None of the stories were good,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband peevishly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill a severe judge, Ridley?\xe2\x80\x9d enquired Mr. Vinrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe bored you so that you left,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ridley, speaking directly to his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nAs this was quite true Helen did not attempt to deny it, and her next\r\nremark, \xe2\x80\x9cBut didn\xe2\x80\x99t they improve after we\xe2\x80\x99d gone?\xe2\x80\x9d was unfortunate, for\r\nher husband answered with a droop of his shoulders, \xe2\x80\x9cIf possible they\r\ngot worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe situation was now one of considerable discomfort for every one\r\nconcerned, as was proved by a long interval of constraint and silence.\r\nMr. Pepper, indeed, created a diversion of a kind by leaping on to his\r\nseat, both feet tucked under him, with the action of a spinster who\r\ndetects a mouse, as the draught struck at his ankles. Drawn up there,\r\nsucking at his cigar, with his arms encircling his knees, he looked\r\nlike the image of Buddha, and from this elevation began a discourse,\r\naddressed to nobody, for nobody had called for it, upon the unplumbed\r\ndepths of ocean. He professed himself surprised to learn that although\r\nMr. Vinrace possessed ten ships, regularly plying between London and\r\nBuenos Aires, not one of them was bidden to investigate the great white\r\nmonsters of the lower waters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Willoughby, \xe2\x80\x9cthe monsters of the earth are too many\r\nfor me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel was heard to sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor little goats!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for the goats there\xe2\x80\x99d be no music, my dear; music\r\ndepends upon goats,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father rather sharply, and Mr. Pepper\r\nwent on to describe the white, hairless, blind monsters lying curled on\r\nthe ridges of sand at the bottom of the sea, which would explode if you\r\nbrought them to the surface, their sides bursting asunder and\r\nscattering entrails to the winds when released from pressure, with\r\nconsiderable detail and with such show of knowledge, that Ridley was\r\ndisgusted, and begged him to stop.\r\n\r\nFrom all this Helen drew her own conclusions, which were gloomy enough.\r\nPepper was a bore; Rachel was an unlicked girl, no doubt prolific of\r\nconfidences, the very first of which would be: \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, I don\xe2\x80\x99t get on\r\nwith my father.\xe2\x80\x9d Willoughby, as usual, loved his business and built his\r\nEmpire, and between them all she would be considerably bored. Being a\r\nwoman of action, however, she rose, and said that for her part she was\r\ngoing to bed. At the door she glanced back instinctively at Rachel,\r\nexpecting that as two of the same sex they would leave the room\r\ntogether. Rachel rose, looked vaguely into Helen\xe2\x80\x99s face, and remarked\r\nwith her slight stammer, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going out to t-t-triumph in the wind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Ambrose\xe2\x80\x99s worst suspicions were confirmed; she went down the\r\npassage lurching from side to side, and fending off the wall now with\r\nher right arm, now with her left; at each lurch she exclaimed\r\nemphatically, \xe2\x80\x9cDamn!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nUncomfortable as the night, with its rocking movement, and salt smells,\r\nmay have been, and in one case undoubtedly was, for Mr. Pepper had\r\ninsufficient clothes upon his bed, the breakfast next morning wore a\r\nkind of beauty. The voyage had begun, and had begun happily with a soft\r\nblue sky, and a calm sea. The sense of untapped resources, things to\r\nsay as yet unsaid, made the hour significant, so that in future years\r\nthe entire journey perhaps would be represented by this one scene, with\r\nthe sound of sirens hooting in the river the night before, somehow\r\nmixing in.\r\n\r\nThe table was cheerful with apples and bread and eggs. Helen handed\r\nWilloughby the butter, and as she did so cast her eye on him and\r\nreflected, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd she married you, and she was happy, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went off on a familiar train of thought, leading on to all kinds of\r\nwell-known reflections, from the old wonder, why Theresa had married\r\nWilloughby?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, one sees all that,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, meaning that one sees that\r\nhe is big and burly, and has a great booming voice, and a fist and a\r\nwill of his own; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d here she slipped into a fine analysis of him\r\nwhich is best represented by one word, \xe2\x80\x9csentimental,\xe2\x80\x9d by which she\r\nmeant that he was never simple and honest about his feelings. For\r\nexample, he seldom spoke of the dead, but kept anniversaries with\r\nsingular pomp. She suspected him of nameless atrocities with regard to\r\nhis daughter, as indeed she had always suspected him of bullying his\r\nwife. Naturally she fell to comparing her own fortunes with the\r\nfortunes of her friend, for Willoughby\xe2\x80\x99s wife had been perhaps the one\r\nwoman Helen called friend, and this comparison often made the staple of\r\ntheir talk. Ridley was a scholar, and Willoughby was a man of business.\r\nRidley was bringing out the third volume of Pindar when Willoughby was\r\nlaunching his first ship. They built a new factory the very year the\r\ncommentary on Aristotle\xe2\x80\x94was it?\xe2\x80\x94appeared at the University Press. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nRachel,\xe2\x80\x9d she looked at her, meaning, no doubt, to decide the argument,\r\nwhich was otherwise too evenly balanced, by declaring that Rachel was\r\nnot comparable to her own children. \xe2\x80\x9cShe really might be six years\r\nold,\xe2\x80\x9d was all she said, however, this judgment referring to the smooth\r\nunmarked outline of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s face, and not condemning her otherwise,\r\nfor if Rachel were ever to think, feel, laugh, or express herself,\r\ninstead of dropping milk from a height as though to see what kind of\r\ndrops it made, she might be interesting though never exactly pretty.\r\nShe was like her mother, as the image in a pool on a still summer\xe2\x80\x99s day\r\nis like the vivid flushed face that hangs over it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Helen herself was under examination, though not from either\r\nof her victims. Mr. Pepper considered her; and his meditations, carried\r\non while he cut his toast into bars and neatly buttered them, took him\r\nthrough a considerable stretch of autobiography. One of his penetrating\r\nglances assured him that he was right last night in judging that Helen\r\nwas beautiful. Blandly he passed her the jam. She was talking nonsense,\r\nbut not worse nonsense than people usually do talk at breakfast, the\r\ncerebral circulation, as he knew to his cost, being apt to give trouble\r\nat that hour. He went on saying \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d to her, on principle, for he never\r\nyielded to a woman on account of her sex. And here, dropping his eyes\r\nto his plate, he became autobiographical. He had not married himself\r\nfor the sufficient reason that he had never met a woman who commanded\r\nhis respect. Condemned to pass the susceptible years of youth in a\r\nrailway station in Bombay, he had seen only coloured women, military\r\nwomen, official women; and his ideal was a woman who could read Greek,\r\nif not Persian, was irreproachably fair in the face, and able to\r\nunderstand the small things he let fall while undressing. As it was he\r\nhad contracted habits of which he was not in the least ashamed. Certain\r\nodd minutes every day went to learning things by heart; he never took a\r\nticket without noting the number; he devoted January to Petronius,\r\nFebruary to Catullus, March to the Etruscan vases perhaps; anyhow he\r\nhad done good work in India, and there was nothing to regret in his\r\nlife except the fundamental defects which no wise man regrets, when the\r\npresent is still his. So concluding he looked up suddenly and smiled.\r\nRachel caught his eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you\xe2\x80\x99ve chewed something thirty-seven times, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nthought, but said politely aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cAre your legs troubling you to-day,\r\nMr. Pepper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy shoulder blades?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, shifting them painfully. \xe2\x80\x9cBeauty has no\r\neffect upon uric acid that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of,\xe2\x80\x9d he sighed, contemplating the\r\nround pane opposite, through which the sky and sea showed blue. At the\r\nsame time he took a little parchment volume from his pocket and laid it\r\non the table. As it was clear that he invited comment, Helen asked him\r\nthe name of it. She got the name; but she got also a disquisition upon\r\nthe proper method of making roads. Beginning with the Greeks, who had,\r\nhe said, many difficulties to contend with, he continued with the\r\nRomans, passed to England and the right method, which speedily became\r\nthe wrong method, and wound up with such a fury of denunciation\r\ndirected against the road-makers of the present day in general, and the\r\nroad-makers of Richmond Park in particular, where Mr. Pepper had the\r\nhabit of cycling every morning before breakfast, that the spoons fairly\r\njingled against the coffee cups, and the insides of at least four rolls\r\nmounted in a heap beside Mr. Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s plate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPebbles!\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, viciously dropping another bread pellet upon\r\nthe heap. \xe2\x80\x9cThe roads of England are mended with pebbles! \xe2\x80\x98With the\r\nfirst heavy rainfall,\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ve told \xe2\x80\x99em, \xe2\x80\x98your road will be a swamp.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAgain and again my words have proved true. But d\xe2\x80\x99you suppose they\r\nlisten to me when I tell \xe2\x80\x99em so, when I point out the consequences, the\r\nconsequences to the public purse, when I recommend \xe2\x80\x99em to read\r\nCoryphaeus? No, Mrs. Ambrose, you will form no just opinion of the\r\nstupidity of mankind until you have sat upon a Borough Council!\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nlittle man fixed her with a glance of ferocious energy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had servants,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Ambrose, concentrating her gaze. \xe2\x80\x9cAt\r\nthis moment I have a nurse. She\xe2\x80\x99s a good woman as they go, but she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndetermined to make my children pray. So far, owing to great care on my\r\npart, they think of God as a kind of walrus; but now that my back\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nturned\xe2\x80\x94Ridley,\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded, swinging round upon her husband, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\nshall we do if we find them saying the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Prayer when we get home\r\nagain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRidley made the sound which is represented by \xe2\x80\x9cTush.\xe2\x80\x9d But Willoughby,\r\nwhose discomfort as he listened was manifested by a slight movement\r\nrocking of his body, said awkwardly, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, surely, Helen, a little\r\nreligion hurts nobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather my children told lies,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, and while\r\nWilloughby was reflecting that his sister-in-law was even more\r\neccentric than he remembered, pushed her chair back and swept upstairs.\r\nIn a second they heard her calling back, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, look! We\xe2\x80\x99re out at sea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey followed her on to the deck. All the smoke and the houses had\r\ndisappeared, and the ship was out in a wide space of sea very fresh and\r\nclear though pale in the early light. They had left London sitting on\r\nits mud. A very thin line of shadow tapered on the horizon, scarcely\r\nthick enough to stand the burden of Paris, which nevertheless rested\r\nupon it. They were free of roads, free of mankind, and the same\r\nexhilaration at their freedom ran through them all. The ship was making\r\nher way steadily through small waves which slapped her and then fizzled\r\nlike effervescing water, leaving a little border of bubbles and foam on\r\neither side. The colourless October sky above was thinly clouded as if\r\nby the trail of wood-fire smoke, and the air was wonderfully salt and\r\nbrisk. Indeed it was too cold to stand still. Mrs. Ambrose drew her arm\r\nwithin her husband\xe2\x80\x99s, and as they moved off it could be seen from the\r\nway in which her sloping cheek turned up to his that she had something\r\nprivate to communicate. They went a few paces and Rachel saw them kiss.\r\n\r\nDown she looked into the depth of the sea. While it was slightly\r\ndisturbed on the surface by the passage of the _Euphrosyne_, beneath it\r\nwas green and dim, and it grew dimmer and dimmer until the sand at the\r\nbottom was only a pale blur. One could scarcely see the black ribs of\r\nwrecked ships, or the spiral towers made by the burrowings of great\r\neels, or the smooth green-sided monsters who came by flickering this\r\nway and that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, Rachel, if any one wants me, I\xe2\x80\x99m busy till one,\xe2\x80\x9d said her\r\nfather, enforcing his words as he often did, when he spoke to his\r\ndaughter, by a smart blow upon the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUntil one,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ll find yourself some employment,\r\neh? Scales, French, a little German, eh? There\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Pepper who knows\r\nmore about separable verbs than any man in Europe, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d and he went off\r\nlaughing. Rachel laughed, too, as indeed she had laughed ever since she\r\ncould remember, without thinking it funny, but because she admired her\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nBut just as she was turning with a view perhaps to finding some\r\nemployment, she was intercepted by a woman who was so broad and so\r\nthick that to be intercepted by her was inevitable. The discreet\r\ntentative way in which she moved, together with her sober black dress,\r\nshowed that she belonged to the lower orders; nevertheless she took up\r\na rock-like position, looking about her to see that no gentry were near\r\nbefore she delivered her message, which had reference to the state of\r\nthe sheets, and was of the utmost gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow ever we\xe2\x80\x99re to get through this voyage, Miss Rachel, I really can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell,\xe2\x80\x9d she began with a shake of her head. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s only just sheets\r\nenough to go round, and the master\xe2\x80\x99s has a rotten place you could put\r\nyour fingers through. And the counterpanes. Did you notice the\r\ncounterpanes? I thought to myself a poor person would have been ashamed\r\nof them. The one I gave Mr. Pepper was hardly fit to cover a dog. . . .\r\nNo, Miss Rachel, they could _not_ be mended; they\xe2\x80\x99re only fit for dust\r\nsheets. Why, if one sewed one\xe2\x80\x99s finger to the bone, one would have\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s work undone the next time they went to the laundry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice in its indignation wavered as if tears were near.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for it but to descend and inspect a large pile of\r\nlinen heaped upon a table. Mrs. Chailey handled the sheets as if she\r\nknew each by name, character, and constitution. Some had yellow stains,\r\nothers had places where the threads made long ladders; but to the\r\nordinary eye they looked much as sheets usually do look, very chill,\r\nwhite, cold, and irreproachably clean.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Mrs. Chailey, turning from the subject of sheets, dismissing\r\nthem entirely, clenched her fists on the top of them, and proclaimed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask a living creature to sit where I sit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Chailey was expected to sit in a cabin which was large enough, but\r\ntoo near the boilers, so that after five minutes she could hear her\r\nheart \xe2\x80\x9cgo,\xe2\x80\x9d she complained, putting her hand above it, which was a\r\nstate of things that Mrs. Vinrace, Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s mother, would never have\r\ndreamt of inflicting\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Vinrace, who knew every sheet in her house,\r\nand expected of every one the best they could do, but no more.\r\n\r\nIt was the easiest thing in the world to grant another room, and the\r\nproblem of sheets simultaneously and miraculously solved itself, the\r\nspots and ladders not being past cure after all, but\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLies! Lies! Lies!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the mistress indignantly, as she ran up\r\non to the deck. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use of telling me lies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn her anger that a woman of fifty should behave like a child and come\r\ncringing to a girl because she wanted to sit where she had not leave to\r\nsit, she did not think of the particular case, and, unpacking her\r\nmusic, soon forgot all about the old woman and her sheets.\r\n\r\nMrs. Chailey folded her sheets, but her expression testified to\r\nflatness within. The world no longer cared about her, and a ship was\r\nnot a home. When the lamps were lit yesterday, and the sailors went\r\ntumbling above her head, she had cried; she would cry this evening; she\r\nwould cry to-morrow. It was not home. Meanwhile she arranged her\r\nornaments in the room which she had won too easily. They were strange\r\nornaments to bring on a sea voyage\xe2\x80\x94china pugs, tea-sets in miniature,\r\ncups stamped floridly with the arms of the city of Bristol, hair-pin\r\nboxes crusted with shamrock, antelopes\xe2\x80\x99 heads in coloured plaster,\r\ntogether with a multitude of tiny photographs, representing downright\r\nworkmen in their Sunday best, and women holding white babies. But there\r\nwas one portrait in a gilt frame, for which a nail was needed, and\r\nbefore she sought it Mrs. Chailey put on her spectacles and read what\r\nwas written on a slip of paper at the back:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis picture of her mistress is given to Emma Chailey by Willoughby\r\nVinrace in gratitude for thirty years of devoted service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTears obliterated the words and the head of the nail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo long as I can do something for your family,\xe2\x80\x9d she was saying, as she\r\nhammered at it, when a voice called melodiously in the passage:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Chailey! Mrs. Chailey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChailey instantly tidied her dress, composed her face, and opened the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in a fix,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Ambrose, who was flushed and out of breath.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what gentlemen are. The chairs too high\xe2\x80\x94the tables too\r\nlow\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s six inches between the floor and the door. What I want\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nhammer, an old quilt, and have you such a thing as a kitchen table?\r\nAnyhow, between us\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she now flung open the door of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsitting room, and revealed Ridley pacing up and down, his forehead all\r\nwrinkled, and the collar of his coat turned up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s as though they\xe2\x80\x99d taken pains to torment me!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, stopping\r\ndead. \xe2\x80\x9cDid I come on this voyage in order to catch rheumatism and\r\npneumonia? Really one might have credited Vinrace with more sense. My\r\ndear,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen was on her knees under a table, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are only making\r\nyourself untidy, and we had much better recognise the fact that we are\r\ncondemned to six weeks of unspeakable misery. To come at all was the\r\nheight of folly, but now that we are here I suppose that I can face it\r\nlike a man. My diseases of course will be increased\xe2\x80\x94I feel already\r\nworse than I did yesterday, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve only ourselves to thank, and the\r\nchildren happily\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMove! Move! Move!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Helen, chasing him from corner to corner with\r\na chair as though he were an errant hen. \xe2\x80\x9cOut of the way, Ridley, and\r\nin half an hour you\xe2\x80\x99ll find it ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned him out of the room, and they could hear him groaning and\r\nswearing as he went along the passage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay he isn\xe2\x80\x99t very strong,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Chailey, looking at Mrs.\r\nAmbrose compassionately, as she helped to shift and carry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s books,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Helen, lifting an armful of sad volumes from the\r\nfloor to the shelf. \xe2\x80\x9cGreek from morning to night. If ever Miss Rachel\r\nmarries, Chailey, pray that she may marry a man who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know his\r\nABC.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe preliminary discomforts and harshnesses, which generally make the\r\nfirst days of a sea voyage so cheerless and trying to the temper, being\r\nsomehow lived through, the succeeding days passed pleasantly enough.\r\nOctober was well advanced, but steadily burning with a warmth that made\r\nthe early months of the summer appear very young and capricious. Great\r\ntracts of the earth lay now beneath the autumn sun, and the whole of\r\nEngland, from the bald moors to the Cornish rocks, was lit up from dawn\r\nto sunset, and showed in stretches of yellow, green, and purple. Under\r\nthat illumination even the roofs of the great towns glittered. In\r\nthousands of small gardens, millions of dark-red flowers were blooming,\r\nuntil the old ladies who had tended them so carefully came down the\r\npaths with their scissors, snipped through their juicy stalks, and laid\r\nthem upon cold stone ledges in the village church. Innumerable parties\r\nof picnickers coming home at sunset cried, \xe2\x80\x9cWas there ever such a day\r\nas this?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s you,\xe2\x80\x9d the young men whispered; \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s you,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nyoung women replied. All old people and many sick people were drawn,\r\nwere it only for a foot or two, into the open air, and prognosticated\r\npleasant things about the course of the world. As for the confidences\r\nand expressions of love that were heard not only in cornfields but in\r\nlamplit rooms, where the windows opened on the garden, and men with\r\ncigars kissed women with grey hairs, they were not to be counted. Some\r\nsaid that the sky was an emblem of the life to come. Long-tailed birds\r\nclattered and screamed, and crossed from wood to wood, with golden eyes\r\nin their plumage.\r\n\r\nBut while all this went on by land, very few people thought about the\r\nsea. They took it for granted that the sea was calm; and there was no\r\nneed, as there is in many houses when the creeper taps on the bedroom\r\nwindows, for the couples to murmur before they kiss, \xe2\x80\x9cThink of the\r\nships to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cThank Heaven, I\xe2\x80\x99m not the man in the lighthouse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nFor all they imagined, the ships when they vanished on the sky-line\r\ndissolved, like snow in water. The grown-up view, indeed, was not much\r\nclearer than the view of the little creatures in bathing drawers who\r\nwere trotting in to the foam all along the coasts of England, and\r\nscooping up buckets full of water. They saw white sails or tufts of\r\nsmoke pass across the horizon, and if you had said that these were\r\nwaterspouts, or the petals of white sea flowers, they would have\r\nagreed.\r\n\r\nThe people in ships, however, took an equally singular view of England.\r\nNot only did it appear to them to be an island, and a very small\r\nisland, but it was a shrinking island in which people were imprisoned.\r\nOne figured them first swarming about like aimless ants, and almost\r\npressing each other over the edge; and then, as the ship withdrew, one\r\nfigured them making a vain clamour, which, being unheard, either\r\nceased, or rose into a brawl. Finally, when the ship was out of sight\r\nof land, it became plain that the people of England were completely\r\nmute. The disease attacked other parts of the earth; Europe shrank,\r\nAsia shrank, Africa and America shrank, until it seemed doubtful\r\nwhether the ship would ever run against any of those wrinkled little\r\nrocks again. But, on the other hand, an immense dignity had descended\r\nupon her; she was an inhabitant of the great world, which has so few\r\ninhabitants, travelling all day across an empty universe, with veils\r\ndrawn before her and behind. She was more lonely than the caravan\r\ncrossing the desert; she was infinitely more mysterious, moving by her\r\nown power and sustained by her own resources. The sea might give her\r\ndeath or some unexampled joy, and none would know of it. She was a\r\nbride going forth to her husband, a virgin unknown of men; in her vigor\r\nand purity she might be likened to all beautiful things, for as a ship\r\nshe had a life of her own.\r\n\r\nIndeed if they had not been blessed in their weather, one blue day\r\nbeing bowled up after another, smooth, round, and flawless, Mrs.\r\nAmbrose would have found it very dull. As it was, she had her\r\nembroidery frame set up on deck, with a little table by her side on\r\nwhich lay open a black volume of philosophy. She chose a thread from\r\nthe vari-coloured tangle that lay in her lap, and sewed red into the\r\nbark of a tree, or yellow into the river torrent. She was working at a\r\ngreat design of a tropical river running through a tropical forest,\r\nwhere spotted deer would eventually browse upon masses of fruit,\r\nbananas, oranges, and giant pomegranates, while a troop of naked\r\nnatives whirled darts into the air. Between the stitches she looked to\r\none side and read a sentence about the Reality of Matter, or the Nature\r\nof Good. Round her men in blue jerseys knelt and scrubbed the boards,\r\nor leant over the rails and whistled, and not far off Mr. Pepper sat\r\ncutting up roots with a penknife. The rest were occupied in other parts\r\nof the ship: Ridley at his Greek\xe2\x80\x94he had never found quarters more to\r\nhis liking; Willoughby at his documents, for he used a voyage to work\r\noff arrears of business; and Rachel\xe2\x80\x94Helen, between her sentences of\r\nphilosophy, wondered sometimes what Rachel _did_ do with herself? She\r\nmeant vaguely to go and see. They had scarcely spoken two words to each\r\nother since that first evening; they were polite when they met, but\r\nthere had been no confidence of any kind. Rachel seemed to get on very\r\nwell with her father\xe2\x80\x94much better, Helen thought, than she ought to\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwas as ready to let Helen alone as Helen was to let her alone.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Rachel was sitting in her room doing absolutely nothing.\r\nWhen the ship was full this apartment bore some magnificent title and\r\nwas the resort of elderly sea-sick ladies who left the deck to their\r\nyoungsters. By virtue of the piano, and a mess of books on the floor,\r\nRachel considered it her room, and there she would sit for hours\r\nplaying very difficult music, reading a little German, or a little\r\nEnglish when the mood took her, and doing\xe2\x80\x94as at this moment\xe2\x80\x94absolutely\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nThe way she had been educated, joined to a fine natural indolence, was\r\nof course partly the reason of it, for she had been educated as the\r\nmajority of well-to-do girls in the last part of the nineteenth century\r\nwere educated. Kindly doctors and gentle old professors had taught her\r\nthe rudiments of about ten different branches of knowledge, but they\r\nwould as soon have forced her to go through one piece of drudgery\r\nthoroughly as they would have told her that her hands were dirty. The\r\none hour or the two hours weekly passed very pleasantly, partly owing\r\nto the other pupils, partly to the fact that the window looked upon the\r\nback of a shop, where figures appeared against the red windows in\r\nwinter, partly to the accidents that are bound to happen when more than\r\ntwo people are in the same room together. But there was no subject in\r\nthe world which she knew accurately. Her mind was in the state of an\r\nintelligent man\xe2\x80\x99s in the beginning of the reign of Queen Elizabeth; she\r\nwould believe practically anything she was told, invent reasons for\r\nanything she said. The shape of the earth, the history of the world,\r\nhow trains worked, or money was invested, what laws were in force,\r\nwhich people wanted what, and why they wanted it, the most elementary\r\nidea of a system in modern life\xe2\x80\x94none of this had been imparted to her\r\nby any of her professors or mistresses. But this system of education\r\nhad one great advantage. It did not teach anything, but it put no\r\nobstacle in the way of any real talent that the pupil might chance to\r\nhave. Rachel, being musical, was allowed to learn nothing but music;\r\nshe became a fanatic about music. All the energies that might have gone\r\ninto languages, science, or literature, that might have made her\r\nfriends, or shown her the world, poured straight into music. Finding\r\nher teachers inadequate, she had practically taught herself. At the age\r\nof twenty-four she knew as much about music as most people do when they\r\nare thirty; and could play as well as nature allowed her to, which, as\r\nbecame daily more obvious, was a really generous allowance. If this one\r\ndefinite gift was surrounded by dreams and ideas of the most\r\nextravagant and foolish description, no one was any the wiser.\r\n\r\nHer education being thus ordinary, her circumstances were no more out\r\nof the common. She was an only child and had never been bullied and\r\nlaughed at by brothers and sisters. Her mother having died when she was\r\neleven, two aunts, the sisters of her father, brought her up, and they\r\nlived for the sake of the air in a comfortable house in Richmond. She\r\nwas of course brought up with excessive care, which as a child was for\r\nher health; as a girl and a young woman was for what it seems almost\r\ncrude to call her morals. Until quite lately she had been completely\r\nignorant that for women such things existed. She groped for knowledge\r\nin old books, and found it in repulsive chunks, but she did not\r\nnaturally care for books and thus never troubled her head about the\r\ncensorship which was exercised first by her aunts, later by her father.\r\nFriends might have told her things, but she had few of her own\r\nage,\xe2\x80\x94Richmond being an awkward place to reach,\xe2\x80\x94and, as it happened, the\r\nonly girl she knew well was a religious zealot, who in the fervour of\r\nintimacy talked about God, and the best ways of taking up one\xe2\x80\x99s cross,\r\na topic only fitfully interesting to one whose mind reached other\r\nstages at other times.\r\n\r\nBut lying in her chair, with one hand behind her head, the other\r\ngrasping the knob on the arm, she was clearly following her thoughts\r\nintently. Her education left her abundant time for thinking. Her eyes\r\nwere fixed so steadily upon a ball on the rail of the ship that she\r\nwould have been startled and annoyed if anything had chanced to obscure\r\nit for a second. She had begun her meditations with a shout of\r\nlaughter, caused by the following translation from _Tristan_:\r\n\r\nIn shrinking trepidation\r\nHis shame he seems to hide\r\nWhile to the king his relation\r\nHe brings the corpse-like Bride.\r\nSeems it so senseless what I say?\r\n\r\n\r\nShe cried that it did, and threw down the book. Next she had picked up\r\n_Cowper\xe2\x80\x99s Letters_, the classic prescribed by her father which had\r\nbored her, so that one sentence chancing to say something about the\r\nsmell of broom in his garden, she had thereupon seen the little hall at\r\nRichmond laden with flowers on the day of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s funeral,\r\nsmelling so strong that now any flower-scent brought back the sickly\r\nhorrible sensation; and so from one scene she passed, half-hearing,\r\nhalf-seeing, to another. She saw her Aunt Lucy arranging flowers in the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt Lucy,\xe2\x80\x9d she volunteered, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like the smell of broom; it\r\nreminds me of funerals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d Aunt Lucy replied; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t say such foolish things,\r\ndear. I always think it a particularly cheerful plant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLying in the hot sun her mind was fixed upon the characters of her\r\naunts, their views, and the way they lived. Indeed this was a subject\r\nthat lasted her hundreds of morning walks round Richmond Park, and\r\nblotted out the trees and the people and the deer. Why did they do the\r\nthings they did, and what did they feel, and what was it all about?\r\nAgain she heard Aunt Lucy talking to Aunt Eleanor. She had been that\r\nmorning to take up the character of a servant, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, of course, at\r\nhalf-past ten in the morning one expects to find the housemaid brushing\r\nthe stairs.\xe2\x80\x9d How odd! How unspeakably odd! But she could not explain to\r\nherself why suddenly as her aunt spoke the whole system in which they\r\nlived had appeared before her eyes as something quite unfamiliar and\r\ninexplicable, and themselves as chairs or umbrellas dropped about here\r\nand there without any reason. She could only say with her slight\r\nstammer, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you f-f-fond of Aunt Eleanor, Aunt Lucy?\xe2\x80\x9d to which her\r\naunt replied, with her nervous hen-like twitter of a laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear\r\nchild, what questions you do ask!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow fond? Very fond!\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel pursued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever thought \xe2\x80\x98how,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Vinrace. \xe2\x80\x9cIf one cares\r\none doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think \xe2\x80\x98how,\xe2\x80\x99 Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d which was aimed at the niece who had\r\nnever yet \xe2\x80\x9ccome\xe2\x80\x9d to her aunts as cordially as they wished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you know I care for you, don\xe2\x80\x99t you, dear, because you\xe2\x80\x99re your\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, if for no other reason, and there _are_ plenty of\r\nother reasons\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and she leant over and kissed her with some emotion, and\r\nthe argument was spilt irretrievably about the place like a bucket of\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nBy these means Rachel reached that stage in thinking, if thinking it\r\ncan be called, when the eyes are intent upon a ball or a knob and the\r\nlips cease to move. Her efforts to come to an understanding had only\r\nhurt her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, and the conclusion must be that it is better\r\nnot to try. To feel anything strongly was to create an abyss between\r\noneself and others who feel strongly perhaps but differently. It was\r\nfar better to play the piano and forget all the rest. The conclusion\r\nwas very welcome. Let these odd men and women\xe2\x80\x94her aunts, the Hunts,\r\nRidley, Helen, Mr. Pepper, and the rest\xe2\x80\x94be symbols,\xe2\x80\x94featureless but\r\ndignified, symbols of age, of youth, of motherhood, of learning, and\r\nbeautiful often as people upon the stage are beautiful. It appeared\r\nthat nobody ever said a thing they meant, or ever talked of a feeling\r\nthey felt, but that was what music was for. Reality dwelling in what\r\none saw and felt, but did not talk about, one could accept a system in\r\nwhich things went round and round quite satisfactorily to other people,\r\nwithout often troubling to think about it, except as something\r\nsuperficially strange. Absorbed by her music she accepted her lot very\r\ncomplacently, blazing into indignation perhaps once a fortnight, and\r\nsubsiding as she subsided now. Inextricably mixed in dreamy confusion,\r\nher mind seemed to enter into communion, to be delightfully expanded\r\nand combined with the spirit of the whitish boards on deck, with the\r\nspirit of the sea, with the spirit of Beethoven Op. 112, even with the\r\nspirit of poor William Cowper there at Olney. Like a ball of\r\nthistledown it kissed the sea, rose, kissed it again, and thus rising\r\nand kissing passed finally out of sight. The rising and falling of the\r\nball of thistledown was represented by the sudden droop forward of her\r\nown head, and when it passed out of sight she was asleep.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later Mrs. Ambrose opened the door and looked at her. It\r\ndid not surprise her to find that this was the way in which Rachel\r\npassed her mornings. She glanced round the room at the piano, at the\r\nbooks, at the general mess. In the first place she considered Rachel\r\naesthetically; lying unprotected she looked somehow like a victim\r\ndropped from the claws of a bird of prey, but considered as a woman, a\r\nyoung woman of twenty-four, the sight gave rise to reflections. Mrs.\r\nAmbrose stood thinking for at least two minutes. She then smiled,\r\nturned noiselessly away and went, lest the sleeper should waken, and\r\nthere should be the awkwardness of speech between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly next morning there was a sound as of chains being drawn roughly\r\noverhead; the steady heart of the _Euphrosyne_ slowly ceased to beat;\r\nand Helen, poking her nose above deck, saw a stationary castle upon a\r\nstationary hill. They had dropped anchor in the mouth of the Tagus, and\r\ninstead of cleaving new waves perpetually, the same waves kept\r\nreturning and washing against the sides of the ship.\r\n\r\nAs soon as breakfast was done, Willoughby disappeared over the vessel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside, carrying a brown leather case, shouting over his shoulder that\r\nevery one was to mind and behave themselves, for he would be kept in\r\nLisbon doing business until five o\xe2\x80\x99clock that afternoon.\r\n\r\nAt about that hour he reappeared, carrying his case, professing himself\r\ntired, bothered, hungry, thirsty, cold, and in immediate need of his\r\ntea. Rubbing his hands, he told them the adventures of the day: how he\r\nhad come upon poor old Jackson combing his moustache before the glass\r\nin the office, little expecting his descent, had put him through such a\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x99s work as seldom came his way; then treated him to a lunch of\r\nchampagne and ortolans; paid a call upon Mrs. Jackson, who was fatter\r\nthan ever, poor woman, but asked kindly after Rachel\xe2\x80\x94and O Lord, little\r\nJackson had confessed to a confounded piece of weakness\xe2\x80\x94well, well, no\r\nharm was done, he supposed, but what was the use of his giving orders\r\nif they were promptly disobeyed? He had said distinctly that he would\r\ntake no passengers on this trip. Here he began searching in his pockets\r\nand eventually discovered a card, which he planked down on the table\r\nbefore Rachel. On it she read, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. and Mrs. Richard Dalloway, 23\r\nBrowne Street, Mayfair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Richard Dalloway,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Vinrace, \xe2\x80\x9cseems to be a gentleman who\r\nthinks that because he was once a member of Parliament, and his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe daughter of a peer, they can have what they like for the asking.\r\nThey got round poor little Jackson anyhow. Said they must have\r\npassages\xe2\x80\x94produced a letter from Lord Glenaway, asking me as a personal\r\nfavour\xe2\x80\x94overruled any objections Jackson made (I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe they came\r\nto much), and so there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing for it but to submit, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it was evident that for some reason or other Willoughby was quite\r\npleased to submit, although he made a show of growling.\r\n\r\nThe truth was that Mr. and Mrs. Dalloway had found themselves stranded\r\nin Lisbon. They had been travelling on the Continent for some weeks,\r\nchiefly with a view to broadening Mr. Dalloway\xe2\x80\x99s mind. Unable for a\r\nseason, by one of the accidents of political life, to serve his country\r\nin Parliament, Mr. Dalloway was doing the best he could to serve it out\r\nof Parliament. For that purpose the Latin countries did very well,\r\nalthough the East, of course, would have done better.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExpect to hear of me next in Petersburg or Teheran,\xe2\x80\x9d he had said,\r\nturning to wave farewell from the steps of the Travellers\xe2\x80\x99. But a\r\ndisease had broken out in the East, there was cholera in Russia, and he\r\nwas heard of, not so romantically, in Lisbon. They had been through\r\nFrance; he had stopped at manufacturing centres where, producing\r\nletters of introduction, he had been shown over works, and noted facts\r\nin a pocket-book. In Spain he and Mrs. Dalloway had mounted mules, for\r\nthey wished to understand how the peasants live. Are they ripe for\r\nrebellion, for example? Mrs. Dalloway had then insisted upon a day or\r\ntwo at Madrid with the pictures. Finally they arrived in Lisbon and\r\nspent six days which, in a journal privately issued afterwards, they\r\ndescribed as of \xe2\x80\x9cunique interest.\xe2\x80\x9d Richard had audiences with\r\nministers, and foretold a crisis at no distant date, \xe2\x80\x9cthe foundations\r\nof government being incurably corrupt. Yet how blame, etc.\xe2\x80\x9d; while\r\nClarissa inspected the royal stables, and took several snapshots\r\nshowing men now exiled and windows now broken. Among other things she\r\nphotographed Fielding\xe2\x80\x99s grave, and let loose a small bird which some\r\nruffian had trapped, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause one hates to think of anything in a cage\r\nwhere English people lie buried,\xe2\x80\x9d the diary stated. Their tour was\r\nthoroughly unconventional, and followed no meditated plan. The foreign\r\ncorrespondents of the _Times_ decided their route as much as anything\r\nelse. Mr. Dalloway wished to look at certain guns, and was of opinion\r\nthat the African coast is far more unsettled than people at home were\r\ninclined to believe. For these reasons they wanted a slow inquisitive\r\nkind of ship, comfortable, for they were bad sailors, but not\r\nextravagant, which would stop for a day or two at this port and at\r\nthat, taking in coal while the Dalloways saw things for themselves.\r\nMeanwhile they found themselves stranded in Lisbon, unable for the\r\nmoment to lay hands upon the precise vessel they wanted. They heard of\r\nthe _Euphrosyne_, but heard also that she was primarily a cargo boat,\r\nand only took passengers by special arrangement, her business being to\r\ncarry dry goods to the Amazons, and rubber home again. \xe2\x80\x9cBy special\r\narrangement,\xe2\x80\x9d however, were words of high encouragement to them, for\r\nthey came of a class where almost everything was specially arranged, or\r\ncould be if necessary. On this occasion all that Richard did was to\r\nwrite a note to Lord Glenaway, the head of the line which bears his\r\ntitle; to call on poor old Jackson; to represent to him how Mrs.\r\nDalloway was so-and-so, and he had been something or other else, and\r\nwhat they wanted was such and such a thing. It was done. They parted\r\nwith compliments and pleasure on both sides, and here, a week later,\r\ncame the boat rowing up to the ship in the dusk with the Dalloways on\r\nboard of it; in three minutes they were standing together on the deck\r\nof the _Euphrosyne_. Their arrival, of course, created some stir, and\r\nit was seen by several pairs of eyes that Mrs. Dalloway was a tall\r\nslight woman, her body wrapped in furs, her head in veils, while Mr.\r\nDalloway appeared to be a middle-sized man of sturdy build, dressed\r\nlike a sportsman on an autumnal moor. Many solid leather bags of a rich\r\nbrown hue soon surrounded them, in addition to which Mr. Dalloway\r\ncarried a despatch box, and his wife a dressing-case suggestive of a\r\ndiamond necklace and bottles with silver tops.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so like Whistler!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, with a wave towards the shore,\r\nas she shook Rachel by the hand, and Rachel had only time to look at\r\nthe grey hills on one side of her before Willoughby introduced Mrs.\r\nChailey, who took the lady to her cabin.\r\n\r\nMomentary though it seemed, nevertheless the interruption was\r\nupsetting; every one was more or less put out by it, from Mr. Grice,\r\nthe steward, to Ridley himself. A few minutes later Rachel passed the\r\nsmoking-room, and found Helen moving arm-chairs. She was absorbed in\r\nher arrangements, and on seeing Rachel remarked confidentially:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf one can give men a room to themselves where they will sit, it\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nto the good. Arm-chairs are _the_ important things\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She began wheeling\r\nthem about. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, does it still look like a bar at a railway station?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe whipped a plush cover off a table. The appearance of the place was\r\nmarvellously improved.\r\n\r\nAgain, the arrival of the strangers made it obvious to Rachel, as the\r\nhour of dinner approached, that she must change her dress; and the\r\nringing of the great bell found her sitting on the edge of her berth in\r\nsuch a position that the little glass above the washstand reflected her\r\nhead and shoulders. In the glass she wore an expression of tense\r\nmelancholy, for she had come to the depressing conclusion, since the\r\narrival of the Dalloways, that her face was not the face she wanted,\r\nand in all probability never would be.\r\n\r\nHowever, punctuality had been impressed on her, and whatever face she\r\nhad, she must go in to dinner.\r\n\r\nThese few minutes had been used by Willoughby in sketching to the\r\nDalloways the people they were to meet, and checking them upon his\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s my brother-in-law, Ambrose, the scholar (I daresay you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nheard his name), his wife, my old friend Pepper, a very quiet fellow,\r\nbut knows everything, I\xe2\x80\x99m told. And that\xe2\x80\x99s all. We\xe2\x80\x99re a very small\r\nparty. I\xe2\x80\x99m dropping them on the coast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Dalloway, with her head a little on one side, did her best to\r\nrecollect Ambrose\xe2\x80\x94was it a surname?\xe2\x80\x94but failed. She was made slightly\r\nuneasy by what she had heard. She knew that scholars married any\r\none\xe2\x80\x94girls they met in farms on reading parties; or little suburban\r\nwomen who said disagreeably, \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I know it\xe2\x80\x99s my husband you\r\nwant; not _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Helen came in at that point, and Mrs. Dalloway saw with relief that\r\nthough slightly eccentric in appearance, she was not untidy, held\r\nherself well, and her voice had restraint in it, which she held to be\r\nthe sign of a lady. Mr. Pepper had not troubled to change his neat ugly\r\nsuit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut after all,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarissa thought to herself as she followed Vinrace in\r\nto dinner, \xe2\x80\x9c_every one\xe2\x80\x99s_ interesting really.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen seated at the table she had some need of that assurance, chiefly\r\nbecause of Ridley, who came in late, looked decidedly unkempt, and took\r\nto his soup in profound gloom.\r\n\r\nAn imperceptible signal passed between husband and wife, meaning that\r\nthey grasped the situation and would stand by each other loyally. With\r\nscarcely a pause Mrs. Dalloway turned to Willoughby and began:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I find so tiresome about the sea is that there are no flowers in\r\nit. Imagine fields of hollyhocks and violets in mid-ocean! How divine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut somewhat dangerous to navigation,\xe2\x80\x9d boomed Richard, in the bass,\r\nlike the bassoon to the flourish of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s violin. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, weeds can\r\nbe bad enough, can\xe2\x80\x99t they, Vinrace? I remember crossing in the\r\n_Mauretania_ once, and saying to the Captain\xe2\x80\x94Richards\xe2\x80\x94did you know\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Now tell me what perils you really dread most for your ship,\r\nCaptain Richards?\xe2\x80\x99 expecting him to say icebergs, or derelicts, or fog,\r\nor something of that sort. Not a bit of it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always remembered his\r\nanswer. \xe2\x80\x98_Sedgius aquatici_,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, which I take to be a kind of\r\nduck-weed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Pepper looked up sharply, and was about to put a question when\r\nWilloughby continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve an awful time of it\xe2\x80\x94those captains! Three thousand souls on\r\nboard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarissa. She turned to Helen with an air of\r\nprofundity. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m convinced people are wrong when they say it\xe2\x80\x99s work\r\nthat wears one; it\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility. That\xe2\x80\x99s why one pays one\xe2\x80\x99s cook\r\nmore than one\xe2\x80\x99s housemaid, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to that, one ought to pay one\xe2\x80\x99s nurse double; but one\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but think what a joy to have to do with babies, instead of\r\nsaucepans!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Dalloway, looking with more interest at Helen, a\r\nprobable mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d much rather be a cook than a nurse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing would\r\ninduce me to take charge of children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMothers always exaggerate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ridley. \xe2\x80\x9cA well-bred child is no\r\nresponsibility. I\xe2\x80\x99ve travelled all over Europe with mine. You just wrap\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em up warm and put \xe2\x80\x99em in the rack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHelen laughed at that. Mrs. Dalloway exclaimed, looking at Ridley:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow like a father! My husband\xe2\x80\x99s just the same. And then one talks of\r\nthe equality of the sexes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes one?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pepper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, some do!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Clarissa. \xe2\x80\x9cMy husband had to pass an irate lady\r\nevery afternoon last session who said nothing else, I imagine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe sat outside the house; it was very awkward,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dalloway. \xe2\x80\x9cAt\r\nlast I plucked up courage and said to her, \xe2\x80\x98My good creature, you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nonly in the way where you are. You\xe2\x80\x99re hindering me, and you\xe2\x80\x99re doing no\r\ngood to yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then she caught him by the coat, and would have scratched his eyes\r\nout\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Dalloway put in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s been exaggerated,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I pity them, I\r\nconfess. The discomfort of sitting on those steps must be awful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cServe them right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Willoughby curtly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m entirely with you there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dalloway. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody can condemn\r\nthe utter folly and futility of such behaviour more than I do; and as\r\nfor the whole agitation, well! may I be in my grave before a woman has\r\nthe right to vote in England! That\xe2\x80\x99s all I say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe solemnity of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s assertion made Clarissa grave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s unthinkable,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell me you\xe2\x80\x99re a suffragist?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nturned to Ridley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care a fig one way or t\xe2\x80\x99other,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ambrose. \xe2\x80\x9cIf any creature\r\nis so deluded as to think that a vote does him or her any good, let him\r\nhave it. He\xe2\x80\x99ll soon learn better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not a politician, I see,\xe2\x80\x9d she smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ridley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid your husband won\xe2\x80\x99t approve of me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dalloway aside, to\r\nMrs. Ambrose. She suddenly recollected that he had been in Parliament.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you ever find it rather dull?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, not knowing exactly\r\nwhat to say.\r\n\r\nRichard spread his hands before him, as if inscriptions were to be read\r\nin the palms of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you ask me whether I ever find it rather dull,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nbound to say yes; on the other hand, if you ask me what career do you\r\nconsider on the whole, taking the good with the bad, the most enjoyable\r\nand enviable, not to speak of its more serious side, of all careers,\r\nfor a man, I am bound to say, \xe2\x80\x98The Politician\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Bar or politics, I agree,\xe2\x80\x9d said Willoughby. \xe2\x80\x9cYou get more run for\r\nyour money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll one\xe2\x80\x99s faculties have their play,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard. \xe2\x80\x9cI may be treading\r\non dangerous ground; but what I feel about poets and artists in general\r\nis this: on your own lines, you can\xe2\x80\x99t be beaten\xe2\x80\x94granted; but off your\r\nown lines\xe2\x80\x94puff\xe2\x80\x94one has to make allowances. Now, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to\r\nthink that any one had to make allowances for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite agree, Richard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Dalloway. \xe2\x80\x9cThink of Shelley.\r\nI feel that there\xe2\x80\x99s almost everything one wants in \xe2\x80\x98Adonais.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead \xe2\x80\x98Adonais\xe2\x80\x99 by all means,\xe2\x80\x9d Richard conceded. \xe2\x80\x9cBut whenever I hear\r\nof Shelley I repeat to myself the words of Matthew Arnold, \xe2\x80\x98What a set!\r\nWhat a set!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis roused Ridley\xe2\x80\x99s attention. \xe2\x80\x9cMatthew Arnold? A detestable prig!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsnapped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA prig\xe2\x80\x94granted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, I think a man of the world.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s where my point comes in. We politicians doubtless seem to you\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(he grasped somehow that Helen was the representative of the arts) \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\ngross commonplace set of people; but we see both sides; we may be\r\nclumsy, but we do our best to get a grasp of things. Now your artists\r\n_find_ things in a mess, shrug their shoulders, turn aside to their\r\nvisions\xe2\x80\x94which I grant may be very beautiful\xe2\x80\x94and _leave_ things in a\r\nmess. Now that seems to me evading one\xe2\x80\x99s responsibilities. Besides, we\r\naren\xe2\x80\x99t all born with the artistic faculty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Dalloway, who, while her husband spoke, had\r\nbeen thinking. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I\xe2\x80\x99m with artists I feel so intensely the delights\r\nof shutting oneself up in a little world of one\xe2\x80\x99s own, with pictures\r\nand music and everything beautiful, and then I go out into the streets\r\nand the first child I meet with its poor, hungry, dirty little face\r\nmakes me turn round and say, \xe2\x80\x98No, I _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ shut myself up\xe2\x80\x94I _won\xe2\x80\x99t_\r\nlive in a world of my own. I should like to stop all the painting and\r\nwriting and music until this kind of thing exists no longer.\xe2\x80\x99 Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nfeel,\xe2\x80\x9d she wound up, addressing Helen, \xe2\x80\x9cthat life\xe2\x80\x99s a perpetual\r\nconflict?\xe2\x80\x9d Helen considered for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, which was decidedly uncomfortable. Mrs. Dalloway\r\nthen gave a little shiver, and asked whether she might have her fur\r\ncloak brought to her. As she adjusted the soft brown fur about her neck\r\na fresh topic struck her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI own,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I shall never forget the _Antigone_. I saw it\r\nat Cambridge years ago, and it\xe2\x80\x99s haunted me ever since. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s quite the most modern thing you ever saw?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked Ridley. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nseemed to me I\xe2\x80\x99d known twenty Clytemnestras. Old Lady Ditchling for\r\none.

I should think it an honour to instruct\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHelen, engaged with Mr. Dalloway and the habit, now fallen into\r\ndecline, of quoting Greek in the House of Commons, noted, in the great\r\ncommonplace book that lies open beside us as we talk, the fact that all\r\nmen, even men like Ridley, really prefer women to be fashionable.\r\n\r\nClarissa exclaimed that she could think of nothing more delightful. For\r\nan instant she saw herself in her drawing-room in Browne Street with a\r\nPlato open on her knees\xe2\x80\x94Plato in the original Greek. She could not help\r\nbelieving that a real scholar, if specially interested, could slip\r\nGreek into her head with scarcely any trouble.\r\n\r\nRidley engaged her to come to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf only your ship is going to treat us kindly!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, drawing\r\nWilloughby into play. For the sake of guests, and these were\r\ndistinguished, Willoughby was ready with a bow of his head to vouch for\r\nthe good behaviour even of the waves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m dreadfully bad; and my husband\xe2\x80\x99s not very good,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Clarissa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am never sick,\xe2\x80\x9d Richard explained. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least, I have only been\r\nactually sick once,\xe2\x80\x9d he corrected himself. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was crossing the\r\nChannel. But a choppy sea, I confess, or still worse, a swell, makes me\r\ndistinctly uncomfortable. The great thing is never to miss a meal. You\r\nlook at the food, and you say, \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x99; you take a mouthful, and Lord\r\nknows how you\xe2\x80\x99re going to swallow it; but persevere, and you often\r\nsettle the attack for good. My wife\xe2\x80\x99s a coward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were pushing back their chairs. The ladies were hesitating at the\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d better show the way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen, advancing.\r\n\r\nRachel followed. She had taken no part in the talk; no one had spoken\r\nto her; but she had listened to every word that was said. She had\r\nlooked from Mrs. Dalloway to Mr. Dalloway, and from Mr. Dalloway back\r\nagain. Clarissa, indeed, was a fascinating spectacle. She wore a white\r\ndress and a long glittering necklace. What with her clothes, and her\r\narch delicate face, which showed exquisitely pink beneath hair turning\r\ngrey, she was astonishingly like an eighteenth-century masterpiece\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nReynolds or a Romney. She made Helen and the others look coarse and\r\nslovenly beside her. Sitting lightly upright she seemed to be dealing\r\nwith the world as she chose; the enormous solid globe spun round this\r\nway and that beneath her fingers. And her husband! Mr. Dalloway rolling\r\nthat rich deliberate voice was even more impressive. He seemed to come\r\nfrom the humming oily centre of the machine where the polished rods are\r\nsliding, and the pistons thumping; he grasped things so firmly but so\r\nloosely; he made the others appear like old maids cheapening remnants.\r\nRachel followed in the wake of the matrons, as if in a trance; a\r\ncurious scent of violets came back from Mrs. Dalloway, mingling with\r\nthe soft rustling of her skirts, and the tinkling of her chains. As she\r\nfollowed, Rachel thought with supreme self-abasement, taking in the\r\nwhole course of her life and the lives of all her friends, \xe2\x80\x9cShe said we\r\nlived in a world of our own. It\xe2\x80\x99s true. We\xe2\x80\x99re perfectly absurd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe sit in here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen, opening the door of the saloon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou play?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Dalloway to Mrs. Ambrose, taking up the score of\r\n_Tristan_ which lay on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy niece does,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen, laying her hand on Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how I envy you!\xe2\x80\x9d Clarissa addressed Rachel for the first time.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you remember this? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it divine?\xe2\x80\x9d She played a bar or two with\r\nringed fingers upon the page.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then Tristan goes like this, and Isolde\xe2\x80\x94oh!\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s all too\r\nthrilling! Have you been to Bayreuth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen that\xe2\x80\x99s still to come. I shall never forget my first _Parsifal_\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ngrilling August day, and those fat old German women, come in their\r\nstuffy high frocks, and then the dark theatre, and the music beginning,\r\nand one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help sobbing. A kind man went and fetched me water, I\r\nremember; and I could only cry on his shoulder! It caught me here\xe2\x80\x9d (she\r\ntouched her throat). \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like nothing else in the world! But where\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyour piano?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s in another room,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you will play to us?\xe2\x80\x9d Clarissa entreated. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine\r\nanything nicer than to sit out in the moonlight and listen to\r\nmusic\xe2\x80\x94only that sounds too like a schoolgirl! You know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nturning to Helen, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think music\xe2\x80\x99s altogether good for people\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo great a strain?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Helen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo emotional, somehow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarissa. \xe2\x80\x9cOne notices it at once when a\r\nboy or girl takes up music as a profession. Sir William Broadley told\r\nme just the same thing. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you hate the kind of attitudes people go\r\ninto over Wagner\xe2\x80\x94like this\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She cast her eyes to the ceiling, clasped\r\nher hands, and assumed a look of intensity. \xe2\x80\x9cIt really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean\r\nthat they appreciate him; in fact, I always think it\xe2\x80\x99s the other way\r\nround. The people who really care about an art are always the least\r\naffected. D\xe2\x80\x99you know Henry Philips, the painter?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo look at, one might think he was a successful stockbroker, and not\r\none of the greatest painters of the age. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are a great many successful stockbrokers, if you like looking at\r\nthem,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen.\r\n\r\nRachel wished vehemently that her aunt would not be so perverse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you see a musician with long hair, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know instinctively\r\nthat he\xe2\x80\x99s bad?\xe2\x80\x9d Clarissa asked, turning to Rachel. \xe2\x80\x9cWatts and\r\nJoachim\xe2\x80\x94they looked just like you and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how much nicer they\xe2\x80\x99d have looked with curls!\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nquestion is, are you going to aim at beauty or are you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCleanliness!\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarissa, \xe2\x80\x9cI do want a man to look clean!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy cleanliness you really mean well-cut clothes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something one knows a gentleman by,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarissa, \xe2\x80\x9cbut one\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t say what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake my husband now, does he look like a gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question seemed to Clarissa in extraordinarily bad taste. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of\r\nthe things that can\xe2\x80\x99t be said,\xe2\x80\x9d she would have put it. She could find\r\nno answer, but a laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, anyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, turning to Rachel, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall insist upon your\r\nplaying to me to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was that in her manner that made Rachel love her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dalloway hid a tiny yawn, a mere dilation of the nostrils.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m extraordinarily sleepy. It\xe2\x80\x99s the sea air.\r\nI think I shall escape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA man\xe2\x80\x99s voice, which she took to be that of Mr. Pepper, strident in\r\ndiscussion, and advancing upon the saloon, gave her the alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night\xe2\x80\x94good-night!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know my way\xe2\x80\x94do pray for calm!\r\nGood-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer yawn must have been the image of a yawn. Instead of letting her\r\nmouth droop, dropping all her clothes in a bunch as though they\r\ndepended on one string, and stretching her limbs to the utmost end of\r\nher berth, she merely changed her dress for a dressing-gown, with\r\ninnumerable frills, and wrapping her feet in a rug, sat down with a\r\nwriting-pad on her knee. Already this cramped little cabin was the\r\ndressing room of a lady of quality. There were bottles containing\r\nliquids; there were trays, boxes, brushes, pins. Evidently not an inch\r\nof her person lacked its proper instrument. The scent which had\r\nintoxicated Rachel pervaded the air. Thus established, Mrs. Dalloway\r\nbegan to write. A pen in her hands became a thing one caressed paper\r\nwith, and she might have been stroking and tickling a kitten as she\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\nPicture us, my dear, afloat in the very oddest ship you can imagine.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the ship, so much as the people. One does come across queer\r\nsorts as one travels. I must say I find it hugely amusing. There\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmanager of the line\xe2\x80\x94called Vinrace\xe2\x80\x94a nice big Englishman, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nmuch\xe2\x80\x94you know the sort. As for the rest\xe2\x80\x94they might have come trailing\r\nout of an old number of _Punch_. They\xe2\x80\x99re like people playing croquet in\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x99sixties. How long they\xe2\x80\x99ve all been shut up in this ship I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94years and years I should say\xe2\x80\x94but one feels as though one had\r\nboarded a little separate world, and they\xe2\x80\x99d never been on shore, or\r\ndone ordinary things in their lives. It\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ve always said about\r\nliterary people\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re far the hardest of any to get on with. The\r\nworst of it is, these people\xe2\x80\x94a man and his wife and a niece\xe2\x80\x94might have\r\nbeen, one feels, just like everybody else, if they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got swallowed\r\nup by Oxford or Cambridge or some such place, and been made cranks of.\r\nThe man\xe2\x80\x99s really delightful (if he\xe2\x80\x99d cut his nails), and the woman has\r\nquite a fine face, only she dresses, of course, in a potato sack, and\r\nwears her hair like a Liberty shopgirl\xe2\x80\x99s. They talk about art, and\r\nthink us such poops for dressing in the evening. However, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nthat; I\xe2\x80\x99d rather die than come in to dinner without changing\xe2\x80\x94wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou? It matters ever so much more than the soup. (It\xe2\x80\x99s odd how things\r\nlike that _do_ matter so much more than what\xe2\x80\x99s generally supposed to\r\nmatter. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have my head cut off than wear flannel next the\r\nskin.) Then there\xe2\x80\x99s a nice shy girl\xe2\x80\x94poor thing\xe2\x80\x94I wish one could rake\r\nher out before it\xe2\x80\x99s too late. She has quite nice eyes and hair, only,\r\nof course, she\xe2\x80\x99ll get funny too. We ought to start a society for\r\nbroadening the minds of the young\xe2\x80\x94much more useful than missionaries,\r\nHester! Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99d forgotten there\xe2\x80\x99s a dreadful little thing called\r\nPepper. He\xe2\x80\x99s just like his name. He\xe2\x80\x99s indescribably insignificant, and\r\nrather queer in his temper, poor dear. It\xe2\x80\x99s like sitting down to dinner\r\nwith an ill-conditioned fox-terrier, only one can\xe2\x80\x99t comb him out, and\r\nsprinkle him with powder, as one would one\xe2\x80\x99s dog. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pity,\r\nsometimes, one can\xe2\x80\x99t treat people like dogs! The great comfort is that\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re away from newspapers, so that Richard will have a real holiday\r\nthis time. Spain wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a holiday. . . .\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou coward!\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard, almost filling the room with his sturdy\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did my duty at dinner!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Clarissa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve let yourself in for the Greek alphabet, anyhow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear! Who _is_ Ambrose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gather that he was a Cambridge don; lives in London now, and edits\r\nclassics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever see such a set of cranks? The woman asked me if I thought\r\nher husband looked like a gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was hard to keep the ball rolling at dinner, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRichard. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it that the women, in that class, are so much queerer\r\nthan the men?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re not half bad-looking, really\xe2\x80\x94only\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re so odd!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey both laughed, thinking of the same things, so that there was no\r\nneed to compare their impressions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see I shall have quite a lot to say to Vinrace,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nknows Sutton and all that set. He can tell me a good deal about the\r\nconditions of ship-building in the North.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad. The men always _are_ so much better than the women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne always has something to say to a man certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt you\xe2\x80\x99ll chatter away fast enough about the babies,\r\nClarice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas she got children? She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like it somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo. A boy and girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA pang of envy shot through Mrs. Dalloway\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe _must_ have a son, Dick,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord, what opportunities there are now for young men!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDalloway, for his talk had set him thinking. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen so good an opening since the days of Pitt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s yours!\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarissa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be a leader of men,\xe2\x80\x9d Richard soliloquised. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a fine career. My\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x94what a career!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe chest slowly curved beneath his waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you know, Dick, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking of England,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife\r\nmeditatively, leaning her head against his chest. \xe2\x80\x9cBeing on this ship\r\nseems to make it so much more vivid\xe2\x80\x94what it really means to be English.\r\nOne thinks of all we\xe2\x80\x99ve done, and our navies, and the people in India\r\nand Africa, and how we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone on century after century, sending out\r\nboys from little country villages\xe2\x80\x94and of men like you, Dick, and it\r\nmakes one feel as if one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear _not_ to be English! Think of\r\nthe light burning over the House, Dick! When I stood on deck just now I\r\nseemed to see it. It\xe2\x80\x99s what one means by London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the continuity,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard sententiously. A vision of English\r\nhistory, King following King, Prime Minister Prime Minister, and Law\r\nLaw had come over him while his wife spoke. He ran his mind along the\r\nline of conservative policy, which went steadily from Lord Salisbury to\r\nAlfred, and gradually enclosed, as though it were a lasso that opened\r\nand caught things, enormous chunks of the habitable globe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s taken a long time, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve pretty nearly done it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nremains to consolidate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd these people don\xe2\x80\x99t see it!\xe2\x80\x9d Clarissa exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt takes all sorts to make a world,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cThere would\r\nnever be a government if there weren\xe2\x80\x99t an opposition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDick, you\xe2\x80\x99re better than I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarissa. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see round, where I\r\nonly see _there_.\xe2\x80\x9d She pressed a point on the back of his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my business, as I tried to explain at dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I like about you, Dick,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cis that you\xe2\x80\x99re always\r\nthe same, and I\xe2\x80\x99m a creature of moods.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a pretty creature, anyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, gazing at her with deeper\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think so, do you? Then kiss me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe kissed her passionately, so that her half-written letter slid to the\r\nground. Picking it up, he read it without asking leave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s your pen?\xe2\x80\x9d he said; and added in his little masculine hand:\r\n\r\nR.D. _loquitur_: Clarice has omitted to tell you that she looked\r\nexceedingly pretty at dinner, and made a conquest by which she has\r\nbound herself to learn the Greek alphabet. I will take this occasion of\r\nadding that we are both enjoying ourselves in these outlandish parts,\r\nand only wish for the presence of our friends (yourself and John, to\r\nwit) to make the trip perfectly enjoyable as it promises to be\r\ninstructive. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nVoices were heard at the end of the corridor. Mrs. Ambrose was speaking\r\nlow; William Pepper was remarking in his definite and rather acid\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cThat is the type of lady with whom I find myself distinctly out\r\nof sympathy. She\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut neither Richard nor Clarissa profited by the verdict, for directly\r\nit seemed likely that they would overhear, Richard crackled a sheet of\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI often wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarissa mused in bed, over the little white volume\r\nof Pascal which went with her everywhere, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether it is really good\r\nfor a woman to live with a man who is morally her superior, as Richard\r\nis mine. It makes one so dependent. I suppose I feel for him what my\r\nmother and women of her generation felt for Christ. It just shows that\r\none can\xe2\x80\x99t do without _something_.\xe2\x80\x9d She then fell into a sleep, which\r\nwas as usual extremely sound and refreshing, but visited by fantastic\r\ndreams of great Greek letters stalking round the room, when she woke up\r\nand laughed to herself, remembering where she was and that the Greek\r\nletters were real people, lying asleep not many yards away. Then,\r\nthinking of the black sea outside tossing beneath the moon, she\r\nshuddered, and thought of her husband and the others as companions on\r\nthe voyage. The dreams were not confined to her indeed, but went from\r\none brain to another. They all dreamt of each other that night, as was\r\nnatural, considering how thin the partitions were between them, and how\r\nstrangely they had been lifted off the earth to sit next each other in\r\nmid-ocean, and see every detail of each other\xe2\x80\x99s faces, and hear\r\nwhatever they chanced to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning Clarissa was up before anyone else. She dressed, and was\r\nout on deck, breathing the fresh air of a calm morning, and, making the\r\ncircuit of the ship for the second time, she ran straight into the lean\r\nperson of Mr. Grice, the steward. She apologised, and at the same time\r\nasked him to enlighten her: what were those shiny brass stands for,\r\nhalf glass on the top? She had been wondering, and could not guess.\r\nWhen he had done explaining, she cried enthusiastically:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do think that to be a sailor must be the finest thing in the world!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what d\xe2\x80\x99you know about it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Grice, kindling in a strange\r\nmanner. \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me. What does any man or woman brought up in England\r\nknow about the sea? They profess to know; but they don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bitterness with which he spoke was ominous of what was to come. He\r\nled her off to his own quarters, and, sitting on the edge of a\r\nbrass-bound table, looking uncommonly like a sea-gull, with her white\r\ntapering body and thin alert face, Mrs. Dalloway had to listen to the\r\ntirade of a fanatical man. Did she realise, to begin with, what a very\r\nsmall part of the world the land was? How peaceful, how beautiful, how\r\nbenignant in comparison the sea? The deep waters could sustain Europe\r\nunaided if every earthly animal died of the plague to-morrow. Mr. Grice\r\nrecalled dreadful sights which he had seen in the richest city of the\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x94men and women standing in line hour after hour to receive a mug\r\nof greasy soup. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I thought of the good flesh down here waiting and\r\nasking to be caught. I\xe2\x80\x99m not exactly a Protestant, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not a\r\nCatholic, but I could almost pray for the days of popery to come\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94because of the fasts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he talked he kept opening drawers and moving little glass jars. Here\r\nwere the treasures which the great ocean had bestowed upon him\xe2\x80\x94pale\r\nfish in greenish liquids, blobs of jelly with streaming tresses, fish\r\nwith lights in their heads, they lived so deep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have swum about among bones,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarissa sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re thinking of Shakespeare,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Grice, and taking down a\r\ncopy from a shelf well lined with books, recited in an emphatic nasal\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFull fathom five thy father lies,\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA grand fellow, Shakespeare,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, replacing the volume.\r\n\r\nClarissa was so glad to hear him say so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is your favourite play? I wonder if it\xe2\x80\x99s the same as mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Henry the Fifth_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Grice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Clarissa. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_Hamlet_ was what you might call too introspective for Mr. Grice, the\r\nsonnets too passionate; Henry the Fifth was to him the model of an\r\nEnglish gentleman. But his favourite reading was Huxley, Herbert\r\nSpencer, and Henry George; while Emerson and Thomas Hardy he read for\r\nrelaxation. He was giving Mrs. Dalloway his views upon the present\r\nstate of England when the breakfast bell rung so imperiously that she\r\nhad to tear herself away, promising to come back and be shown his\r\nsea-weeds.\r\n\r\nThe party, which had seemed so odd to her the night before, was already\r\ngathered round the table, still under the influence of sleep, and\r\ntherefore uncommunicative, but her entrance sent a little flutter like\r\na breath of air through them all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had the most interesting talk of my life!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, taking\r\nher seat beside Willoughby. \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you realise that one of your men is a\r\nphilosopher and a poet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very interesting fellow\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what I always say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Willoughby,\r\ndistinguishing Mr. Grice. \xe2\x80\x9cThough Rachel finds him a bore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a bore when he talks about currents,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel. Her eyes were\r\nfull of sleep, but Mrs. Dalloway still seemed to her wonderful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never met a bore yet!\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarissa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I should say the world was full of them!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Helen. But her\r\nbeauty, which was radiant in the morning light, took the contrariness\r\nfrom her words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI agree that it\xe2\x80\x99s the worst one can possibly say of any one,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nClarissa. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much rather one would be a murderer than a bore!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded, with her usual air of saying something profound. \xe2\x80\x9cOne can fancy\r\nliking a murderer. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same with dogs. Some dogs are awful bores,\r\npoor dears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt happened that Richard was sitting next to Rachel. She was curiously\r\nconscious of his presence and appearance\xe2\x80\x94his well-cut clothes, his\r\ncrackling shirt-front, his cuffs with blue rings round them, and the\r\nsquare-tipped, very clean fingers with the red stone on the little\r\nfinger of the left hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had a dog who was a bore and knew it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing her in\r\ncool, easy tones. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was a Skye terrier, one of those long chaps, with\r\nlittle feet poking out from their hair like\xe2\x80\x94like caterpillars\xe2\x80\x94no, like\r\nsofas I should say. Well, we had another dog at the same time, a black\r\nbrisk animal\xe2\x80\x94a Schipperke, I think, you call them. You can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine a\r\ngreater contrast. The Skye so slow and deliberate, looking up at you\r\nlike some old gentleman in the club, as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nreally mean it, do you?\xe2\x80\x99 and the Schipperke as quick as a knife. I\r\nliked the Skye best, I must confess. There was something pathetic about\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe story seemed to have no climax.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened to him?\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a very sad story,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard, lowering his voice and peeling\r\nan apple. \xe2\x80\x9cHe followed my wife in the car one day and got run over by a\r\nbrute of a cyclist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas he killed?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rachel.\r\n\r\nBut Clarissa at her end of the table had overheard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk of it!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a thing I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to think of\r\nto this day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSurely the tears stood in her eyes?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the painful thing about pets,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Dalloway; \xe2\x80\x9cthey die.\r\nThe first sorrow I can remember was for the death of a dormouse. I\r\nregret to say that I sat upon it. Still, that didn\xe2\x80\x99t make one any the\r\nless sorry. Here lies the duck that Samuel Johnson sat on, eh? I was\r\nbig for my age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we had canaries,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9ca pair of ring-doves, a lemur,\r\nand at one time a martin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you live in the country?\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel asked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe lived in the country for six months of the year. When I say \xe2\x80\x98we\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nmean four sisters, a brother, and myself. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like coming\r\nof a large family. Sisters particularly are delightful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDick, you were horribly spoilt!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Clarissa across the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no. Appreciated,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard.\r\n\r\nRachel had other questions on the tip of her tongue; or rather one\r\nenormous question, which she did not in the least know how to put into\r\nwords. The talk appeared too airy to admit of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease tell me\xe2\x80\x94everything.\xe2\x80\x9d That was what she wanted to say. He had\r\ndrawn apart one little chink and showed astonishing treasures. It\r\nseemed to her incredible that a man like that should be willing to talk\r\nto her. He had sisters and pets, and once lived in the country. She\r\nstirred her tea round and round; the bubbles which swam and clustered\r\nin the cup seemed to her like the union of their minds.\r\n\r\nThe talk meanwhile raced past her, and when Richard suddenly stated in\r\na jocular tone of voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure Miss Vinrace, now, has secret\r\nleanings towards Catholicism,\xe2\x80\x9d she had no idea what to answer, and\r\nHelen could not help laughing at the start she gave.\r\n\r\nHowever, breakfast was over and Mrs. Dalloway was rising. \xe2\x80\x9cI always\r\nthink religion\xe2\x80\x99s like collecting beetles,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, summing up the\r\ndiscussion as she went up the stairs with Helen. \xe2\x80\x9cOne person has a\r\npassion for black beetles; another hasn\xe2\x80\x99t; it\xe2\x80\x99s no good arguing about\r\nit. What\xe2\x80\x99s _your_ black beetle now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s my children,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s different,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarissa breathed. \xe2\x80\x9cDo tell me. You have a boy,\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t you? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it detestable, leaving them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as though a blue shadow had fallen across a pool. Their eyes\r\nbecame deeper, and their voices more cordial. Instead of joining them\r\nas they began to pace the deck, Rachel was indignant with the\r\nprosperous matrons, who made her feel outside their world and\r\nmotherless, and turning back, she left them abruptly. She slammed the\r\ndoor of her room, and pulled out her music. It was all old music\xe2\x80\x94Bach\r\nand Beethoven, Mozart and Purcell\xe2\x80\x94the pages yellow, the engraving rough\r\nto the finger. In three minutes she was deep in a very difficult, very\r\nclassical fugue in A, and over her face came a queer remote impersonal\r\nexpression of complete absorption and anxious satisfaction. Now she\r\nstumbled; now she faltered and had to play the same bar twice over; but\r\nan invisible line seemed to string the notes together, from which rose\r\na shape, a building. She was so far absorbed in this work, for it was\r\nreally difficult to find how all these sounds should stand together,\r\nand drew upon the whole of her faculties, that she never heard a knock\r\nat the door. It was burst impulsively open, and Mrs. Dalloway stood in\r\nthe room leaving the door open, so that a strip of the white deck and\r\nof the blue sea appeared through the opening. The shape of the Bach\r\nfugue crashed to the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let me interrupt,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarissa implored. \xe2\x80\x9cI heard you playing, and\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t resist. I adore Bach!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel flushed and fumbled her fingers in her lap. She stood up\r\nawkwardly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too difficult,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you were playing quite splendidly! I ought to have stayed\r\noutside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel.\r\n\r\nShe slid _Cowper\xe2\x80\x99s Letters_ and _Wuthering Heights_ out of the\r\narm-chair, so that Clarissa was invited to sit there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a dear little room!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking round. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, _Cowper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nLetters_! I\xe2\x80\x99ve never read them. Are they nice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather dull,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wrote awfully well, didn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarissa; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94if one likes that\r\nkind of thing\xe2\x80\x94finished his sentences and all that. _Wuthering Heights_!\r\nAh\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s more in my line. I really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t exist without the Brontes!\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you love them? Still, on the whole, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather live without them\r\nthan without Jane Austen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLightly and at random though she spoke, her manner conveyed an\r\nextraordinary degree of sympathy and desire to befriend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJane Austen? I don\xe2\x80\x99t like Jane Austen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou monster!\xe2\x80\x9d Clarissa exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI can only just forgive you. Tell\r\nme why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s so\xe2\x80\x94so\xe2\x80\x94well, so like a tight plait,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel floundered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94I see what you mean. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree. And you won\xe2\x80\x99t when you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nolder. At your age I only liked Shelley. I can remember sobbing over\r\nhim in the garden.\r\n\r\nHe has outsoared the shadow of our night,\r\nEnvy and calumny and hate and pain\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\nyou remember?\r\n\r\nCan touch him not and torture not again\r\nFrom the contagion of the world\xe2\x80\x99s slow stain.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow divine!\xe2\x80\x94and yet what nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d She looked lightly round the room.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always think it\xe2\x80\x99s _living_, not dying, that counts. I really respect\r\nsome snuffy old stockbroker who\xe2\x80\x99s gone on adding up column after column\r\nall his days, and trotting back to his villa at Brixton with some old\r\npug dog he worships, and a dreary little wife sitting at the end of the\r\ntable, and going off to Margate for a fortnight\xe2\x80\x94I assure you I know\r\nheaps like that\xe2\x80\x94well, they seem to me _really_ nobler than poets whom\r\nevery one worships, just because they\xe2\x80\x99re geniuses and die young. But I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t expect _you_ to agree with me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pressed Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUm-m-m\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she went on quoting\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nUnrest which men miscall delight\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhen you\xe2\x80\x99re my age you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that the world is _crammed_ with\r\ndelightful things. I think young people make such a mistake about\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94not letting themselves be happy. I sometimes think that happiness\r\nis the only thing that counts. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know you well enough to say, but\r\nI should guess you might be a little inclined to\xe2\x80\x94when one\xe2\x80\x99s young and\r\nattractive\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m going to say it!\xe2\x80\x94_every_thing\xe2\x80\x99s at one\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nglanced round as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cnot only a few stuffy books and\r\nBach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI long to ask questions,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cYou interest me so much. If\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m impertinent, you must just box my ears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x94I want to ask questions,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel with such earnestness that\r\nMrs. Dalloway had to check her smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you mind if we walk?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe air\xe2\x80\x99s so delicious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe snuffed it like a racehorse as they shut the door and stood on\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it good to be alive?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, and drew Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s arm\r\nwithin hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, look! How exquisite!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shores of Portugal were beginning to lose their substance; but the\r\nland was still the land, though at a great distance. They could\r\ndistinguish the little towns that were sprinkled in the folds of the\r\nhills, and the smoke rising faintly. The towns appeared to be very\r\nsmall in comparison with the great purple mountains behind them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonestly, though,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarissa, having looked, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like views.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re too inhuman.\xe2\x80\x9d They walked on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow odd it is!\xe2\x80\x9d she continued impulsively. \xe2\x80\x9cThis time yesterday we\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nnever met. I was packing in a stuffy little room in the hotel. We know\r\nabsolutely nothing about each other\xe2\x80\x94and yet\xe2\x80\x94I feel as if I _did_ know\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have children\xe2\x80\x94your husband was in Parliament?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve never been to school, and you live\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith my aunts at Richmond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRichmond?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, my aunts like the Park. They like the quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you don\xe2\x80\x99t! I understand!\xe2\x80\x9d Clarissa laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like walking in the Park alone; but not\xe2\x80\x94with the dogs,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; and some people _are_ dogs; aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarissa, as if she\r\nhad guessed a secret. \xe2\x80\x9cBut not every one\xe2\x80\x94oh no, not every one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot every one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel, and stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can quite imagine you walking alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarissa: \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthinking\xe2\x80\x94in a little world of your own. But how you will enjoy it\xe2\x80\x94some\r\nday!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall enjoy walking with a man\xe2\x80\x94is that what you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel,\r\nregarding Mrs. Dalloway with her large enquiring eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking of a man particularly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarissa. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\r\nwill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I shall never marry,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel determined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so sure of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarissa. Her sidelong glance\r\ntold Rachel that she found her attractive although she was inexplicably\r\namused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do people marry?\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to find out,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarissa laughed.\r\n\r\nRachel followed her eyes and found that they rested for a second, on\r\nthe robust figure of Richard Dalloway, who was engaged in striking a\r\nmatch on the sole of his boot; while Willoughby expounded something,\r\nwhich seemed to be of great interest to them both.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like it,\xe2\x80\x9d she concluded. \xe2\x80\x9cDo tell me about the\r\nAmbroses. Or am I asking too many questions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI find you easy to talk to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel.\r\n\r\nThe short sketch of the Ambroses was, however, somewhat perfunctory,\r\nand contained little but the fact that Mr. Ambrose was her uncle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour mother\xe2\x80\x99s brother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen a name has dropped out of use, the lightest touch upon it tells.\r\nMrs. Dalloway went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you like your mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; she was different,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel.\r\n\r\nShe was overcome by an intense desire to tell Mrs. Dalloway things she\r\nhad never told any one\xe2\x80\x94things she had not realised herself until this\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am lonely,\xe2\x80\x9d she began. \xe2\x80\x9cI want\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She did not know what she wanted,\r\nso that she could not finish the sentence; but her lip quivered.\r\n\r\nBut it seemed that Mrs. Dalloway was able to understand without words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, actually putting one arm round Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was your age I wanted too. No one understood until I met\r\nRichard. He gave me all I wanted. He\xe2\x80\x99s man and woman as well.\xe2\x80\x9d Her eyes\r\nrested upon Mr. Dalloway, leaning upon the rail, still talking. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink I say that because I\xe2\x80\x99m his wife\xe2\x80\x94I see his faults more clearly\r\nthan I see any one else\xe2\x80\x99s. What one wants in the person one lives with\r\nis that they should keep one at one\xe2\x80\x99s best. I often wonder what I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ndone to be so happy!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, and a tear slid down her cheek.\r\nShe wiped it away, squeezed Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow good life is!\xe2\x80\x9d At that moment, standing out in the fresh breeze,\r\nwith the sun upon the waves, and Mrs. Dalloway\xe2\x80\x99s hand upon her arm, it\r\nseemed indeed as if life which had been unnamed before was infinitely\r\nwonderful, and too good to be true.\r\n\r\nHere Helen passed them, and seeing Rachel arm-in-arm with a comparative\r\nstranger, looking excited, was amused, but at the same time slightly\r\nirritated. But they were immediately joined by Richard, who had enjoyed\r\na very interesting talk with Willoughby and was in a sociable mood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cObserve my Panama,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, touching the brim of his hat. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you\r\naware, Miss Vinrace, how much can be done to induce fine weather by\r\nappropriate headdress? I have determined that it is a hot summer day; I\r\nwarn you that nothing you can say will shake me. Therefore I am going\r\nto sit down. I advise you to follow my example.\xe2\x80\x9d Three chairs in a row\r\ninvited them to be seated.\r\n\r\nLeaning back, Richard surveyed the waves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a very pretty blue,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s a little too much of\r\nit. Variety is essential to a view. Thus, if you have hills you ought\r\nto have a river; if a river, hills. The best view in the world in my\r\nopinion is that from Boars Hill on a fine day\xe2\x80\x94it must be a fine day,\r\nmark you\xe2\x80\x94A rug?\xe2\x80\x94Oh, thank you, my dear . . . in that case you have also\r\nthe advantage of associations\xe2\x80\x94the Past.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you want to talk, Dick, or shall I read aloud?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarissa had fetched a book with the rugs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Persuasion_,\xe2\x80\x9d announced Richard, examining the volume.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s for Miss Vinrace,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarissa. \xe2\x80\x9cShe can\xe2\x80\x99t bear our beloved\r\nJane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x94if I may say so\xe2\x80\x94is because you have not read her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is incomparably the greatest female writer we possess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is the greatest,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cand for this reason: she does not\r\nattempt to write like a man. Every other woman does; on that account, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t read \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProduce your instances, Miss Vinrace,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, joining his\r\nfinger-tips. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m ready to be converted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited, while Rachel vainly tried to vindicate her sex from the\r\nslight he put upon it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid he\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarissa. \xe2\x80\x9cHe generally is\xe2\x80\x94the wretch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI brought _Persuasion_,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I thought it was a\r\nlittle less threadbare than the others\xe2\x80\x94though, Dick, it\xe2\x80\x99s no good\r\n_your_ pretending to know Jane by heart, considering that she always\r\nsends you to sleep!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the labours of legislation, I deserve sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not to think about those guns,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarissa, seeing that his\r\neye, passing over the waves, still sought the land meditatively, \xe2\x80\x9cor\r\nabout navies, or empires, or anything.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying she opened the book\r\nand began to read:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Sir Walter Elliott, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man\r\nwho, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the\r\n_Baronetage_\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you know Sir Walter?\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98There he found occupation for\r\nan idle hour, and consolation in a distressed one.\xe2\x80\x99 She does write\r\nwell, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t she? \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d She read on in a light humorous voice. She\r\nwas determined that Sir Walter should take her husband\xe2\x80\x99s mind off the\r\nguns of Britain, and divert him in an exquisite, quaint, sprightly, and\r\nslightly ridiculous world. After a time it appeared that the sun was\r\nsinking in that world, and the points becoming softer. Rachel looked up\r\nto see what caused the change. Richard\xe2\x80\x99s eyelids were closing and\r\nopening; opening and closing. A loud nasal breath announced that he no\r\nlonger considered appearances, that he was sound asleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTriumph!\xe2\x80\x9d Clarissa whispered at the end of a sentence. Suddenly she\r\nraised her hand in protest. A sailor hesitated; she gave the book to\r\nRachel, and stepped lightly to take the message\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Grice wished to\r\nknow if it was convenient,\xe2\x80\x9d etc. She followed him. Ridley, who had\r\nprowled unheeded, started forward, stopped, and, with a gesture of\r\ndisgust, strode off to his study. The sleeping politician was left in\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s charge. She read a sentence, and took a look at him. In sleep\r\nhe looked like a coat hanging at the end of a bed; there were all the\r\nwrinkles, and the sleeves and trousers kept their shape though no\r\nlonger filled out by legs and arms. You can then best judge the age and\r\nstate of the coat. She looked him all over until it seemed to her that\r\nhe must protest.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of forty perhaps; and here there were lines round his\r\neyes, and there curious clefts in his cheeks. Slightly battered he\r\nappeared, but dogged and in the prime of life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSisters and a dormouse and some canaries,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel murmured, never\r\ntaking her eyes off him. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder, I wonder.\xe2\x80\x9d She ceased, her chin\r\nupon her hand, still looking at him. A bell chimed behind them, and\r\nRichard raised his head. Then he opened his eyes which wore for a\r\nsecond the queer look of a shortsighted person\xe2\x80\x99s whose spectacles are\r\nlost. It took him a moment to recover from the impropriety of having\r\nsnored, and possibly grunted, before a young lady. To wake and find\r\noneself left alone with one was also slightly disconcerting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I\xe2\x80\x99ve been dozing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s happened to everyone?\r\nClarissa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Dalloway has gone to look at Mr. Grice\xe2\x80\x99s fish,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might have guessed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a common occurrence. And\r\nhow have you improved the shining hour? Have you become a convert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve read a line,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I always find. There are too many things to look at. I\r\nfind nature very stimulating myself. My best ideas have come to me out\r\nof doors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you were walking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalking\xe2\x80\x94riding\xe2\x80\x94yachting\xe2\x80\x94I suppose the most momentous conversations of\r\nmy life took place while perambulating the great court at Trinity. I\r\nwas at both universities. It was a fad of my father\xe2\x80\x99s. He thought it\r\nbroadening to the mind. I think I agree with him. I can remember\xe2\x80\x94what\r\nan age ago it seems!\xe2\x80\x94settling the basis of a future state with the\r\npresent Secretary for India. We thought ourselves very wise. I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nsure we weren\xe2\x80\x99t. We were happy, Miss Vinrace, and we were young\xe2\x80\x94gifts\r\nwhich make for wisdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you done what you said you\xe2\x80\x99d do?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA searching question! I answer\xe2\x80\x94Yes and No. If on the one hand I have\r\nnot accomplished what I set out to accomplish\xe2\x80\x94which of us does!\xe2\x80\x94on the\r\nother I can fairly say this: I have not lowered my ideal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked resolutely at a sea-gull, as though his ideal flew on the\r\nwings of the bird.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat _is_ your ideal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you ask too much, Miss Vinrace,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard playfully.\r\n\r\nShe could only say that she wanted to know, and Richard was\r\nsufficiently amused to answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how shall I reply? In one word\xe2\x80\x94Unity. Unity of aim, of dominion,\r\nof progress. The dispersion of the best ideas over the greatest area.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe English?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI grant that the English seem, on the whole, whiter than most men,\r\ntheir records cleaner. But, good Lord, don\xe2\x80\x99t run away with the idea\r\nthat I don\xe2\x80\x99t see the drawbacks\xe2\x80\x94horrors\xe2\x80\x94unmentionable things done in our\r\nvery midst! I\xe2\x80\x99m under no illusions. Few people, I suppose, have fewer\r\nillusions than I have. Have you ever been in a factory, Miss\r\nVinrace!\xe2\x80\x94No, I suppose not\xe2\x80\x94I may say I hope not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs for Rachel, she had scarcely walked through a poor street, and\r\nalways under the escort of father, maid, or aunts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was going to say that if you\xe2\x80\x99d ever seen the kind of thing that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoing on round you, you\xe2\x80\x99d understand what it is that makes me and men\r\nlike me politicians. You asked me a moment ago whether I\xe2\x80\x99d done what I\r\nset out to do. Well, when I consider my life, there is one fact I admit\r\nthat I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of; owing to me some thousands of girls in\r\nLancashire\xe2\x80\x94and many thousands to come after them\xe2\x80\x94can spend an hour\r\nevery day in the open air which their mothers had to spend over their\r\nlooms. I\xe2\x80\x99m prouder of that, I own, than I should be of writing Keats\r\nand Shelley into the bargain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt became painful to Rachel to be one of those who write Keats and\r\nShelley. She liked Richard Dalloway, and warmed as he warmed. He seemed\r\nto mean what he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s far better that you should know nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said paternally,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand you wrong yourself, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. You play very nicely, I\xe2\x80\x99m told, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt you\xe2\x80\x99ve read heaps of learned books.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElderly banter would no longer check her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talk of unity,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to make me understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never allow my wife to talk politics,\xe2\x80\x9d he said seriously. \xe2\x80\x9cFor this\r\nreason. It is impossible for human beings, constituted as they are,\r\nboth to fight and to have ideals. If I have preserved mine, as I am\r\nthankful to say that in great measure I have, it is due to the fact\r\nthat I have been able to come home to my wife in the evening and to\r\nfind that she has spent her day in calling, music, play with the\r\nchildren, domestic duties\xe2\x80\x94what you will; her illusions have not been\r\ndestroyed. She gives me courage to go on. The strain of public life is\r\nvery great,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\nThis made him appear a battered martyr, parting every day with some of\r\nthe finest gold, in the service of mankind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t think,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9chow any one does it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExplain, Miss Vinrace,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a matter I want to\r\nclear up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis kindness was genuine, and she determined to take the chance he gave\r\nher, although to talk to a man of such worth and authority made her\r\nheart beat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me like this,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, doing her best first to\r\nrecollect and then to expose her shivering private visions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s an old widow in her room, somewhere, let us suppose in the\r\nsuburbs of Leeds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRichard bent his head to show that he accepted the widow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn London you\xe2\x80\x99re spending your life, talking, writing things, getting\r\nbills through, missing what seems natural. The result of it all is that\r\nshe goes to her cupboard and finds a little more tea, a few lumps of\r\nsugar, or a little less tea and a newspaper. Widows all over the\r\ncountry I admit do this. Still, there\xe2\x80\x99s the mind of the widow\xe2\x80\x94the\r\naffections; those you leave untouched. But you waste you own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the widow goes to her cupboard and finds it bare,\xe2\x80\x9d Richard\r\nanswered, \xe2\x80\x9cher spiritual outlook we may admit will be affected. If I\r\nmay pick holes in your philosophy, Miss Vinrace, which has its merits,\r\nI would point out that a human being is not a set of compartments, but\r\nan organism. Imagination, Miss Vinrace; use your imagination; that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhere you young Liberals fail. Conceive the world as a whole. Now for\r\nyour second point; when you assert that in trying to set the house in\r\norder for the benefit of the young generation I am wasting my higher\r\ncapabilities, I totally disagree with you. I can conceive no more\r\nexalted aim\xe2\x80\x94to be the citizen of the Empire. Look at it in this way,\r\nMiss Vinrace; conceive the state as a complicated machine; we citizens\r\nare parts of that machine; some fulfil more important duties; others\r\n(perhaps I am one of them) serve only to connect some obscure parts of\r\nthe mechanism, concealed from the public eye. Yet if the meanest screw\r\nfails in its task, the proper working of the whole is imperilled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to combine the image of a lean black widow, gazing\r\nout of her window, and longing for some one to talk to, with the image\r\nof a vast machine, such as one sees at South Kensington, thumping,\r\nthumping, thumping. The attempt at communication had been a failure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to understand each other,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I say something that will make you very angry?\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then; no woman has what I may call the political instinct. You\r\nhave very great virtues; I am the first, I hope, to admit that; but I\r\nhave never met a woman who even saw what is meant by statesmanship. I\r\nam going to make you still more angry. I hope that I never shall meet\r\nsuch a woman. Now, Miss Vinrace, are we enemies for life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVanity, irritation, and a thrusting desire to be understood, urged her\r\nto make another attempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder the streets, in the sewers, in the wires, in the telephones,\r\nthere is something alive; is that what you mean? In things like\r\ndust-carts, and men mending roads? You feel that all the time when you\r\nwalk about London, and when you turn on a tap and the water comes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard. \xe2\x80\x9cI understand you to mean that the whole of\r\nmodern society is based upon cooperative effort. If only more people\r\nwould realise that, Miss Vinrace, there would be fewer of your old\r\nwidows in solitary lodgings!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel considered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you a Liberal or are you a Conservative?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI call myself a Conservative for convenience sake,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard,\r\nsmiling. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there is more in common between the two parties than\r\npeople generally allow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, which did not come on Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s side from any lack of\r\nthings to say; as usual she could not say them, and was further\r\nconfused by the fact that the time for talking probably ran short. She\r\nwas haunted by absurd jumbled ideas\xe2\x80\x94how, if one went back far enough,\r\neverything perhaps was intelligible; everything was in common; for the\r\nmammoths who pastured in the fields of Richmond High Street had turned\r\ninto paving stones and boxes full of ribbon, and her aunts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you say you lived in the country when you were a child?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nCrude as her manners seemed to him, Richard was flattered. There could\r\nbe no doubt that her interest was genuine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did,\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what happened?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cOr do I ask too many questions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m flattered, I assure you. But\xe2\x80\x94let me see\xe2\x80\x94what happened? Well,\r\nriding, lessons, sisters. There was an enchanted rubbish heap, I\r\nremember, where all kinds of queer things happened. Odd, what things\r\nimpress children! I can remember the look of the place to this day.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a fallacy to think that children are happy. They\xe2\x80\x99re not; they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nunhappy. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never suffered so much as I did when I was a child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t get on well with my father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard shortly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was a\r\nvery able man, but hard. Well\xe2\x80\x94it makes one determined not to sin in\r\nthat way oneself. Children never forget injustice. They forgive heaps\r\nof things grown-up people mind; but that sin is the unpardonable sin.\r\nMind you\xe2\x80\x94I daresay I was a difficult child to manage; but when I think\r\nwhat I was ready to give! No, I was more sinned against than sinning.\r\nAnd then I went to school, where I did very fairly well; and and then,\r\nas I say, my father sent me to both universities. . . . D\xe2\x80\x99you know,\r\nMiss Vinrace, you\xe2\x80\x99ve made me think? How little, after all, one can tell\r\nanybody about one\xe2\x80\x99s life! Here I sit; there you sit; both, I doubt not,\r\nchock-full of the most interesting experiences, ideas, emotions; yet\r\nhow communicate? I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you what every second person you meet might\r\ntell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think so,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the way of saying things, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it,\r\nnot the things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard. \xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly true.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I look back\r\nover my life\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m forty-two\xe2\x80\x94what are the great facts that stand out?\r\nWhat were the revelations, if I may call them so? The misery of the\r\npoor and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d (he hesitated and pitched over) \xe2\x80\x9clove!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon that word he lowered his voice; it was a word that seemed to\r\nunveil the skies for Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an odd thing to say to a young lady,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cBut have you\r\nany idea what\xe2\x80\x94what I mean by that? No, of course not. I don\xe2\x80\x99t use the\r\nword in a conventional sense. I use it as young men use it. Girls are\r\nkept very ignorant, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they? Perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s wise\xe2\x80\x94perhaps\xe2\x80\x94You _don\xe2\x80\x99t_\r\nknow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke as if he had lost consciousness of what he was saying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, scarcely speaking above her breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWarships, Dick! Over there! Look!\xe2\x80\x9d Clarissa, released from Mr. Grice,\r\nappreciative of all his seaweeds, skimmed towards them, gesticulating.\r\n\r\nShe had sighted two sinister grey vessels, low in the water, and bald\r\nas bone, one closely following the other with the look of eyeless\r\nbeasts seeking their prey. Consciousness returned to Richard instantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy George!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, and stood shielding his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOurs, Dick?\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarissa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Mediterranean Fleet,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\nThe _Euphrosyne_ was slowly dipping her flag. Richard raised his hat.\r\nConvulsively Clarissa squeezed Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you glad to be English!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThe warships drew past, casting a curious effect of discipline and\r\nsadness upon the waters, and it was not until they were again invisible\r\nthat people spoke to each other naturally. At lunch the talk was all of\r\nvalour and death, and the magnificent qualities of British admirals.\r\nClarissa quoted one poet, Willoughby quoted another. Life on board a\r\nman-of-war was splendid, so they agreed, and sailors, whenever one met\r\nthem, were quite especially nice and simple.\r\n\r\nThis being so, no one liked it when Helen remarked that it seemed to\r\nher as wrong to keep sailors as to keep a Zoo, and that as for dying on\r\na battle-field, surely it was time we ceased to praise courage\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cor to\r\nwrite bad poetry about it,\xe2\x80\x9d snarled Pepper.\r\n\r\nBut Helen was really wondering why Rachel, sitting silent, looked so\r\nqueer and flushed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was not able to follow up her observations, however, or to come to\r\nany conclusion, for by one of those accidents which are liable to\r\nhappen at sea, the whole course of their lives was now put out of\r\norder.\r\n\r\nEven at tea the floor rose beneath their feet and pitched too low\r\nagain, and at dinner the ship seemed to groan and strain as though a\r\nlash were descending. She who had been a broad-backed dray-horse, upon\r\nwhose hind-quarters pierrots might waltz, became a colt in a field. The\r\nplates slanted away from the knives, and Mrs. Dalloway\xe2\x80\x99s face blanched\r\nfor a second as she helped herself and saw the potatoes roll this way\r\nand that. Willoughby, of course, extolled the virtues of his ship, and\r\nquoted what had been said of her by experts and distinguished\r\npassengers, for he loved his own possessions. Still, dinner was uneasy,\r\nand directly the ladies were alone Clarissa owned that she would be\r\nbetter off in bed, and went, smiling bravely.\r\n\r\nNext morning the storm was on them, and no politeness could ignore it.\r\nMrs. Dalloway stayed in her room. Richard faced three meals, eating\r\nvaliantly at each; but at the third, certain glazed asparagus swimming\r\nin oil finally conquered him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat beats me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and withdrew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we are alone once more,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked William Pepper, looking round\r\nthe table; but no one was ready to engage him in talk, and the meal\r\nended in silence.\r\n\r\nOn the following day they met\xe2\x80\x94but as flying leaves meet in the air.\r\nSick they were not; but the wind propelled them hastily into rooms,\r\nviolently downstairs. They passed each other gasping on deck; they\r\nshouted across tables. They wore fur coats; and Helen was never seen\r\nwithout a bandanna on her head. For comfort they retreated to their\r\ncabins, where with tightly wedged feet they let the ship bounce and\r\ntumble. Their sensations were the sensations of potatoes in a sack on a\r\ngalloping horse. The world outside was merely a violent grey tumult.\r\nFor two days they had a perfect rest from their old emotions. Rachel\r\nhad just enough consciousness to suppose herself a donkey on the summit\r\nof a moor in a hail-storm, with its coat blown into furrows; then she\r\nbecame a wizened tree, perpetually driven back by the salt Atlantic\r\ngale.\r\n\r\nHelen, on the other hand, staggered to Mrs. Dalloway\xe2\x80\x99s door, knocked,\r\ncould not be heard for the slamming of doors and the battering of wind,\r\nand entered.\r\n\r\nThere were basins, of course. Mrs. Dalloway lay half-raised on a\r\npillow, and did not open her eyes. Then she murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Dick, is\r\nthat you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHelen shouted\xe2\x80\x94for she was thrown against the washstand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarissa opened one eye. It gave her an incredibly dissipated\r\nappearance. \xe2\x80\x9cAwful!\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped. Her lips were white inside.\r\n\r\nPlanting her feet wide, Helen contrived to pour champagne into a\r\ntumbler with a tooth-brush in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChampagne,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a tooth-brush in it,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Clarissa, and smiled; it might\r\nhave been the contortion of one weeping. She drank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDisgusting,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, indicating the basins. Relics of humour\r\nstill played over her face like moonshine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWant more?\xe2\x80\x9d Helen shouted. Speech was again beyond Clarissa\xe2\x80\x99s reach.\r\nThe wind laid the ship shivering on her side. Pale agonies crossed Mrs.\r\nDalloway in waves. When the curtains flapped, grey lights puffed across\r\nher. Between the spasms of the storm, Helen made the curtain fast,\r\nshook the pillows, stretched the bed-clothes, and smoothed the hot\r\nnostrils and forehead with cold scent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _are_ good!\xe2\x80\x9d Clarissa gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cHorrid mess!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was trying to apologise for white underclothes fallen and scattered\r\non the floor. For one second she opened a single eye, and saw that the\r\nroom was tidy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s nice,\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped.\r\n\r\nHelen left her; far, far away she knew that she felt a kind of liking\r\nfor Mrs. Dalloway. She could not help respecting her spirit and her\r\ndesire, even in the throes of sickness, for a tidy bedroom. Her\r\npetticoats, however, rose above her knees.\r\n\r\nQuite suddenly the storm relaxed its grasp. It happened at tea; the\r\nexpected paroxysm of the blast gave out just as it reached its climax\r\nand dwindled away, and the ship instead of taking the usual plunge went\r\nsteadily. The monotonous order of plunging and rising, roaring and\r\nrelaxing, was interfered with, and every one at table looked up and\r\nfelt something loosen within them. The strain was slackened and human\r\nfeelings began to peep again, as they do when daylight shows at the end\r\nof a tunnel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry a turn with me,\xe2\x80\x9d Ridley called across to Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFoolish!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Helen, but they went stumbling up the ladder. Choked\r\nby the wind their spirits rose with a rush, for on the skirts of all\r\nthe grey tumult was a misty spot of gold. Instantly the world dropped\r\ninto shape; they were no longer atoms flying in the void, but people\r\nriding a triumphant ship on the back of the sea. Wind and space were\r\nbanished; the world floated like an apple in a tub, and the mind of\r\nman, which had been unmoored also, once more attached itself to the old\r\nbeliefs.\r\n\r\nHaving scrambled twice round the ship and received many sound cuffs\r\nfrom the wind, they saw a sailor\xe2\x80\x99s face positively shine golden. They\r\nlooked, and beheld a complete yellow circle of sun; next minute it was\r\ntraversed by sailing stands of cloud, and then completely hidden. By\r\nbreakfast the next morning, however, the sky was swept clean, the\r\nwaves, although steep, were blue, and after their view of the strange\r\nunder-world, inhabited by phantoms, people began to live among tea-pots\r\nand loaves of bread with greater zest than ever.\r\n\r\nRichard and Clarissa, however, still remained on the borderland. She\r\ndid not attempt to sit up; her husband stood on his feet, contemplated\r\nhis waistcoat and trousers, shook his head, and then lay down again.\r\nThe inside of his brain was still rising and falling like the sea on\r\nthe stage. At four o\xe2\x80\x99clock he woke from sleep and saw the sunlight make\r\na vivid angle across the red plush curtains and the grey tweed\r\ntrousers. The ordinary world outside slid into his mind, and by the\r\ntime he was dressed he was an English gentleman again.\r\n\r\nHe stood beside his wife. She pulled him down to her by the lapel of\r\nhis coat, kissed him, and held him fast for a minute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and get a breath of air, Dick,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou look quite washed\r\nout. . . . How nice you smell! . . . And be polite to that woman. She\r\nwas so kind to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereupon Mrs. Dalloway turned to the cool side of her pillow, terribly\r\nflattened but still invincible.\r\n\r\nRichard found Helen talking to her brother-in-law, over two dishes of\r\nyellow cake and smooth bread and butter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look very ill!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed on seeing him. \xe2\x80\x9cCome and have some\r\ntea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe remarked that the hands that moved about the cups were beautiful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear you\xe2\x80\x99ve been very good to my wife,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s had an awful\r\ntime of it. You came in and fed her with champagne. Were you among the\r\nsaved yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? Oh, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been sick for twenty years\xe2\x80\x94sea-sick, I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are three stages of convalescence, I always say,\xe2\x80\x9d broke in the\r\nhearty voice of Willoughby. \xe2\x80\x9cThe milk stage, the bread-and-butter\r\nstage, and the roast-beef stage. I should say you were at the\r\nbread-and-butter stage.\xe2\x80\x9d He handed him the plate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I should advise a hearty tea, then a brisk walk on deck; and by\r\ndinner-time you\xe2\x80\x99ll be clamouring for beef, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d He went off laughing,\r\nexcusing himself on the score of business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a splendid fellow he is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard. \xe2\x80\x9cAlways keen on\r\nsomething.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s always been like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a great undertaking of his,\xe2\x80\x9d Richard continued. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nbusiness that won\xe2\x80\x99t stop with ships, I should say. We shall see him in\r\nParliament, or I\xe2\x80\x99m much mistaken. He\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of man we want in\r\nParliament\xe2\x80\x94the man who has done things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Helen was not much interested in her brother-in-law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect your head\xe2\x80\x99s aching, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, pouring a fresh\r\ncup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s humiliating to find what a slave one\r\nis to one\xe2\x80\x99s body in this world. D\xe2\x80\x99you know, I can never work without a\r\nkettle on the hob. As often as not I don\xe2\x80\x99t drink tea, but I must feel\r\nthat I can if I want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s very bad for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shortens one\xe2\x80\x99s life; but I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, Mrs. Ambrose, we politicians\r\nmust make up our minds to that at the outset. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to burn the\r\ncandle at both ends, or\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve cooked your goose!\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen brightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t make you take us seriously, Mrs. Ambrose,\xe2\x80\x9d he protested. \xe2\x80\x9cMay\r\nI ask how you\xe2\x80\x99ve spent your time? Reading\xe2\x80\x94philosophy?\xe2\x80\x9d (He saw the\r\nblack book.) \xe2\x80\x9cMetaphysics and fishing!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had to live\r\nagain I believe I should devote myself to one or the other.\xe2\x80\x9d He began\r\nturning the pages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Good, then, is indefinable,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he read out. \xe2\x80\x9cHow jolly to think that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoing on still! \xe2\x80\x98So far as I know there is only one ethical writer,\r\nProfessor Henry Sidgwick, who has clearly recognised and stated this\r\nfact.\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s just the kind of thing we used to talk about when we were\r\nboys. I can remember arguing until five in the morning with Duffy\xe2\x80\x94now\r\nSecretary for India\xe2\x80\x94pacing round and round those cloisters until we\r\ndecided it was too late to go to bed, and we went for a ride instead.\r\nWhether we ever came to any conclusion\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s another matter. Still,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s the arguing that counts. It\xe2\x80\x99s things like that that stand out in\r\nlife. Nothing\xe2\x80\x99s been quite so vivid since. It\xe2\x80\x99s the philosophers, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe scholars,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re the people who pass the torch,\r\nwho keep the light burning by which we live. Being a politician doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nnecessarily blind one to that, Mrs. Ambrose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Why should it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen. \xe2\x80\x9cBut can you remember if your wife\r\ntakes sugar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe lifted the tray and went off with it to Mrs. Dalloway.\r\n\r\nRichard twisted a muffler twice round his throat and struggled up on\r\ndeck. His body, which had grown white and tender in a dark room,\r\ntingled all over in the fresh air. He felt himself a man undoubtedly in\r\nthe prime of life. Pride glowed in his eye as he let the wind buffet\r\nhim and stood firm. With his head slightly lowered he sheered round\r\ncorners, strode uphill, and met the blast. There was a collision. For a\r\nsecond he could not see what the body was he had run into. \xe2\x80\x9cSorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSorry.\xe2\x80\x9d It was Rachel who apologised. They both laughed, too much\r\nblown about to speak. She drove open the door of her room and stepped\r\ninto its calm. In order to speak to her, it was necessary that Richard\r\nshould follow. They stood in a whirlpool of wind; papers began flying\r\nround in circles, the door crashed to, and they tumbled, laughing, into\r\nchairs. Richard sat upon Bach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy word! What a tempest!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel. Certainly the struggle and wind had\r\ngiven her a decision she lacked; red was in her cheeks, and her hair\r\nwas down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what fun!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I sitting on? Is this your room? How\r\njolly!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x94sit there,\xe2\x80\x9d she commanded. Cowper slid once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow jolly to meet again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems an age. _Cowper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nLetters_? . . . Bach? . . . _Wuthering Heights_? . . . Is this where\r\nyou meditate on the world, and then come out and pose poor politicians\r\nwith questions? In the intervals of sea-sickness I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought a lot of\r\nour talk. I assure you, you made me think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made you think! But why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat solitary icebergs we are, Miss Vinrace! How little we can\r\ncommunicate! There are lots of things I should like to tell you\r\nabout\xe2\x80\x94to hear your opinion of. Have you ever read Burke?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBurke?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cWho was Burke?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo? Well, then I shall make a point of sending you a copy. _The Speech\r\non the French Revolution_\xe2\x80\x94_The American Rebellion_? Which shall it be,\r\nI wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d He noted something in his pocket-book. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then you must\r\nwrite and tell me what you think of it. This reticence\xe2\x80\x94this\r\nisolation\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with modern life! Now, tell me about\r\nyourself. What are your interests and occupations? I should imagine\r\nthat you were a person with very strong interests. Of course you are!\r\nGood God! When I think of the age we live in, with its opportunities\r\nand possibilities, the mass of things to be done and enjoyed\xe2\x80\x94why\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t we ten lives instead of one? But about yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, I\xe2\x80\x99m a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know\xe2\x80\x94I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard, throwing his head back, and drawing his\r\nfingers across his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow strange to be a woman! A young and beautiful woman,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued\r\nsententiously, \xe2\x80\x9chas the whole world at her feet. That\xe2\x80\x99s true, Miss\r\nVinrace. You have an inestimable power\xe2\x80\x94for good or for evil. What\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you do\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he broke off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have beauty,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. The ship lurched. Rachel fell slightly\r\nforward. Richard took her in his arms and kissed her. Holding her\r\ntight, he kissed her passionately, so that she felt the hardness of his\r\nbody and the roughness of his cheek printed upon hers. She fell back in\r\nher chair, with tremendous beats of the heart, each of which sent black\r\nwaves across her eyes. He clasped his forehead in his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou tempt me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. The tone of his voice was terrifying. He\r\nseemed choked in fright. They were both trembling. Rachel stood up and\r\nwent. Her head was cold, her knees shaking, and the physical pain of\r\nthe emotion was so great that she could only keep herself moving above\r\nthe great leaps of her heart. She leant upon the rail of the ship, and\r\ngradually ceased to feel, for a chill of body and mind crept over her.\r\nFar out between the waves little black and white sea-birds were riding.\r\nRising and falling with smooth and graceful movements in the hollows of\r\nthe waves they seemed singularly detached and unconcerned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re peaceful,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. She became peaceful too, at the same time\r\npossessed with a strange exultation. Life seemed to hold infinite\r\npossibilities she had never guessed at. She leant upon the rail and\r\nlooked over the troubled grey waters, where the sunlight was fitfully\r\nscattered upon the crests of the waves, until she was cold and\r\nabsolutely calm again. Nevertheless something wonderful had happened.\r\n\r\nAt dinner, however, she did not feel exalted, but merely uncomfortable,\r\nas if she and Richard had seen something together which is hidden in\r\nordinary life, so that they did not like to look at each other. Richard\r\nslid his eyes over her uneasily once, and never looked at her again.\r\nFormal platitudes were manufactured with effort, but Willoughby was\r\nkindled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeef for Mr. Dalloway!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cCome now\xe2\x80\x94after that walk you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nat the beef stage, Dalloway!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWonderful masculine stories followed about Bright and Disraeli and\r\ncoalition governments, wonderful stories which made the people at the\r\ndinner-table seem featureless and small. After dinner, sitting alone\r\nwith Rachel under the great swinging lamp, Helen was struck by her\r\npallor. It once more occurred to her that there was something strange\r\nin the girl\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look tired. Are you tired?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot tired,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I suppose I am tired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHelen advised bed, and she went, not seeing Richard again. She must\r\nhave been very tired for she fell asleep at once, but after an hour or\r\ntwo of dreamless sleep, she dreamt. She dreamt that she was walking\r\ndown a long tunnel, which grew so narrow by degrees that she could\r\ntouch the damp bricks on either side. At length the tunnel opened and\r\nbecame a vault; she found herself trapped in it, bricks meeting her\r\nwherever she turned, alone with a little deformed man who squatted on\r\nthe floor gibbering, with long nails. His face was pitted and like the\r\nface of an animal. The wall behind him oozed with damp, which collected\r\ninto drops and slid down. Still and cold as death she lay, not daring\r\nto move, until she broke the agony by tossing herself across the bed,\r\nand woke crying \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLight showed her the familiar things: her clothes, fallen off the\r\nchair; the water jug gleaming white; but the horror did not go at once.\r\nShe felt herself pursued, so that she got up and actually locked her\r\ndoor. A voice moaned for her; eyes desired her. All night long\r\nbarbarian men harassed the ship; they came scuffling down the passages,\r\nand stopped to snuffle at her door. She could not sleep again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the tragedy of life\xe2\x80\x94as I always say!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Dalloway.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeginning things and having to end them. Still, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to let\r\n_this_ end, if you\xe2\x80\x99re willing.\xe2\x80\x9d It was the morning, the sea was calm,\r\nand the ship once again was anchored not far from another shore.\r\n\r\nShe was dressed in her long fur cloak, with the veils wound around her\r\nhead, and once more the rich boxes stood on top of each other so that\r\nthe scene of a few days back seemed to be repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you suppose we shall ever meet in London?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ridley ironically.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have forgotten all about me by the time you step out there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the shore of the little bay, where they could now see the\r\nseparate trees with moving branches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow horrid you are!\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cRachel\xe2\x80\x99s coming to see me\r\nanyhow\xe2\x80\x94the instant you get back,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pressing Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve no excuse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a silver pencil she wrote her name and address on the flyleaf of\r\n_Persuasion_, and gave the book to Rachel. Sailors were shouldering the\r\nluggage, and people were beginning to congregate. There were Captain\r\nCobbold, Mr. Grice, Willoughby, Helen, and an obscure grateful man in a\r\nblue jersey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarissa. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-bye. I _do_ like you,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nmurmured as she kissed Rachel. People in the way made it unnecessary\r\nfor Richard to shake Rachel by the hand; he managed to look at her very\r\nstiffly for a second before he followed his wife down the ship\xe2\x80\x99s side.\r\n\r\nThe boat separating from the vessel made off towards the land, and for\r\nsome minutes Helen, Ridley, and Rachel leant over the rail, watching.\r\nOnce Mrs. Dalloway turned and waved; but the boat steadily grew smaller\r\nand smaller until it ceased to rise and fall, and nothing could be seen\r\nsave two resolute backs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s over,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ridley after a long silence. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall never\r\nsee _them_ again,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning to go to his books. A feeling of\r\nemptiness and melancholy came over them; they knew in their hearts that\r\nit was over, and that they had parted for ever, and the knowledge\r\nfilled them with far greater depression than the length of their\r\nacquaintance seemed to justify. Even as the boat pulled away they could\r\nfeel other sights and sounds beginning to take the place of the\r\nDalloways, and the feeling was so unpleasant that they tried to resist\r\nit. For so, too, would they be forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn much the same way as Mrs. Chailey downstairs was sweeping the\r\nwithered rose-leaves off the dressing-table, so Helen was anxious to\r\nmake things straight again after the visitors had gone. Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nobvious languor and listlessness made her an easy prey, and indeed\r\nHelen had devised a kind of trap. That something had happened she now\r\nfelt pretty certain; moreover, she had come to think that they had been\r\nstrangers long enough; she wished to know what the girl was like,\r\npartly of course because Rachel showed no disposition to be known. So,\r\nas they turned from the rail, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and talk to me instead of practising,\xe2\x80\x9d and led the way to the\r\nsheltered side where the deck-chairs were stretched in the sun. Rachel\r\nfollowed her indifferently. Her mind was absorbed by Richard; by the\r\nextreme strangeness of what had happened, and by a thousand feelings of\r\nwhich she had not been conscious before. She made scarcely any attempt\r\nto listen to what Helen was saying, as Helen indulged in commonplaces\r\nto begin with. While Mrs. Ambrose arranged her embroidery, sucked her\r\nsilk, and threaded her needle, she lay back gazing at the horizon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you like those people?\xe2\x80\x9d Helen asked her casually.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied blankly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talked to him, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said nothing for a minute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe kissed me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said without any change of tone.\r\n\r\nHelen started, looked at her, but could not make out what she felt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM-m-m\xe2\x80\x99yes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, after a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought he was that kind of\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of man?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPompous and sentimental.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you really didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the first time since Helen had known her Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s eyes lit up\r\nbrightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did mind,\xe2\x80\x9d she said vehemently. \xe2\x80\x9cI dreamt. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me what happened,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen. She had to keep her lips from\r\ntwitching as she listened to Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s story. It was poured out abruptly\r\nwith great seriousness and no sense of humour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe talked about politics. He told me what he had done for the poor\r\nsomewhere. I asked him all sorts of questions. He told me about his own\r\nlife. The day before yesterday, after the storm, he came in to see me.\r\nIt happened then, quite suddenly. He kissed me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why.\xe2\x80\x9d As\r\nshe spoke she grew flushed. \xe2\x80\x9cI was a good deal excited,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind till afterwards; when\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she paused, and saw the\r\nfigure of the bloated little man again\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI became terrified.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom the look in her eyes it was evident she was again terrified. Helen\r\nwas really at a loss what to say. From the little she knew of Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nupbringing she supposed that she had been kept entirely ignorant as to\r\nthe relations of men with women. With a shyness which she felt with\r\nwomen and not with men she did not like to explain simply what these\r\nare. Therefore she took the other course and belittled the whole\r\naffair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe was a silly creature, and if I were you, I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nthink no more about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel, sitting bolt upright, \xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t do that. I shall\r\nthink about it all day and all night until I find out exactly what it\r\ndoes mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you ever read?\xe2\x80\x9d Helen asked tentatively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Cowper\xe2\x80\x99s Letters_\xe2\x80\x94that kind of thing. Father gets them for me or my\r\nAunts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHelen could hardly restrain herself from saying out loud what she\r\nthought of a man who brought up his daughter so that at the age of\r\ntwenty-four she scarcely knew that men desired women and was terrified\r\nby a kiss. She had good reason to fear that Rachel had made herself\r\nincredibly ridiculous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know many men?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pepper,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel ironically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo no one\xe2\x80\x99s ever wanted to marry you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered ingenuously.\r\n\r\nHelen reflected that as, from what she had said, Rachel certainly would\r\nthink these things out, it might be as well to help her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to be frightened,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the most natural thing\r\nin the world. Men will want to kiss you, just as they\xe2\x80\x99ll want to marry\r\nyou. The pity is to get things out of proportion. It\xe2\x80\x99s like noticing\r\nthe noises people make when they eat, or men spitting; or, in short,\r\nany small thing that gets on one\xe2\x80\x99s nerves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel seemed to be inattentive to these remarks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat are those women in Piccadilly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Picadilly? They are prostituted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _is_ terrifying\xe2\x80\x94it _is_ disgusting,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel asserted, as if she\r\nincluded Helen in the hatred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did like him,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel mused, as if speaking to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to\r\ntalk to him; I wanted to know what he\xe2\x80\x99d done. The women in Lancashire\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her as she recalled their talk that there was something\r\nlovable about Richard, good in their attempted friendship, and\r\nstrangely piteous in the way they had parted.\r\n\r\nThe softening of her mood was apparent to Helen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must take things as they are; and if you want\r\nfriendship with men you must run risks. Personally,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued,\r\nbreaking into a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth it; I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind being\r\nkissed; I\xe2\x80\x99m rather jealous, I believe, that Mr. Dalloway kissed you and\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t kiss me. Though,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9che bored me considerably.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Rachel did not return the smile or dismiss the whole affair, as\r\nHelen meant her to. Her mind was working very quickly, inconsistently\r\nand painfully. Helen\xe2\x80\x99s words hewed down great blocks which had stood\r\nthere always, and the light which came in was cold. After sitting for a\r\ntime with fixed eyes, she burst out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that\xe2\x80\x99s why I can\xe2\x80\x99t walk alone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this new light she saw her life for the first time a creeping\r\nhedged-in thing, driven cautiously between high walls, here turned\r\naside, there plunged in darkness, made dull and crippled for ever\xe2\x80\x94her\r\nlife that was the only chance she had\xe2\x80\x94a thousand words and actions\r\nbecame plain to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause men are brutes! I hate men!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you said you liked him?\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI liked him, and I liked being kissed,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, as if that only\r\nadded more difficulties to her problem.\r\n\r\nHelen was surprised to see how genuine both shock and problem were, but\r\nshe could think of no way of easing the difficulty except by going on\r\ntalking. She wanted to make her niece talk, and so to understand why\r\nthis rather dull, kindly, plausible politician had made so deep an\r\nimpression on her, for surely at the age of twenty-four this was not\r\nnatural.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did you like Mrs. Dalloway too?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nAs she spoke she saw Rachel redden; for she remembered silly things she\r\nhad said, and also, it occurred to her that she treated this exquisite\r\nwoman rather badly, for Mrs. Dalloway had said that she loved her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was quite nice, but a thimble-pated creature,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nnever heard such nonsense! Chitter-chatter-chitter-chatter\xe2\x80\x94fish and the\r\nGreek alphabet\xe2\x80\x94never listened to a word any one said\xe2\x80\x94chock-full of\r\nidiotic theories about the way to bring up children\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d far rather talk\r\nto him any day. He was pompous, but he did at least understand what was\r\nsaid to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe glamour insensibly faded a little both from Richard and Clarissa.\r\nThey had not been so wonderful after all, then, in the eyes of a mature\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult to know what people are like,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel remarked,\r\nand Helen saw with pleasure that she spoke more naturally. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I\r\nwas taken in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was little doubt about that according to Helen, but she\r\nrestrained herself and said aloud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne has to make experiments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they _were_ nice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were extraordinarily\r\ninteresting.\xe2\x80\x9d She tried to recall the image of the world as a live\r\nthing that Richard had given her, with drains like nerves, and bad\r\nhouses like patches of diseased skin. She recalled his\r\nwatch-words\xe2\x80\x94Unity\xe2\x80\x94Imagination, and saw again the bubbles meeting in her\r\ntea-cup as he spoke of sisters and canaries, boyhood and his father,\r\nher small world becoming wonderfully enlarged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut all people don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to you equally interesting, do they?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nMrs. Ambrose.\r\n\r\nRachel explained that most people had hitherto been symbols; but that\r\nwhen they talked to one they ceased to be symbols, and became\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI could\r\nlisten to them for ever!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. She then jumped up,\r\ndisappeared downstairs for a minute, and came back with a fat red book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Who\xe2\x80\x99s Who_,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, laying it upon Helen\xe2\x80\x99s knee and turning the\r\npages. \xe2\x80\x9cIt gives short lives of people\xe2\x80\x94for instance: \xe2\x80\x98Sir Roland Beal;\r\nborn 1852; parents from Moffatt; educated at Rugby; passed first into\r\nR.E.; married 1878 the daughter of T. Fishwick; served in the\r\nBechuanaland Expedition 1884-85 (honourably mentioned). Clubs: United\r\nService, Naval and Military. Recreations: an enthusiastic curler.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSitting on the deck at Helen\xe2\x80\x99s feet she went on turning the pages and\r\nreading biographies of bankers, writers, clergymen, sailors, surgeons,\r\njudges, professors, statesmen, editors, philanthropists, merchants, and\r\nactresses; what clubs they belonged to, where they lived, what games\r\nthey played, and how many acres they owned.\r\n\r\nShe became absorbed in the book.\r\n\r\nHelen meanwhile stitched at her embroidery and thought over the things\r\nthey had said. Her conclusion was that she would very much like to show\r\nher niece, if it were possible, how to live, or as she put it, how to\r\nbe a reasonable person. She thought that there must be something wrong\r\nin this confusion between politics and kissing politicians, and that an\r\nelder person ought to be able to help.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite agree,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat people are very interesting; only\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nRachel, putting her finger between the pages, looked up enquiringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly I think you ought to discriminate,\xe2\x80\x9d she ended. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pity to be\r\nintimate with people who are\xe2\x80\x94well, rather second-rate, like the\r\nDalloways, and to find it out later.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how does one know?\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Helen candidly, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthought. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to find out for yourself. But try and\xe2\x80\x94Why don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou call me Helen?\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99 a horrid name. I never liked\r\nmy Aunts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to call you Helen,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you think me very unsympathetic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel reviewed the points which Helen had certainly failed to\r\nunderstand; they arose chiefly from the difference of nearly twenty\r\nyears in age between them, which made Mrs. Ambrose appear too humorous\r\nand cool in a matter of such moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cSome things you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cSo now you can go ahead and be a person on\r\nyour own account,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\nThe vision of her own personality, of herself as a real everlasting\r\nthing, different from anything else, unmergeable, like the sea or the\r\nwind, flashed into Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and she became profoundly excited at\r\nthe thought of living.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can by m-m-myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she stammered, \xe2\x80\x9cin spite of you, in spite of the\r\nDalloways, and Mr. Pepper, and Father, and my Aunts, in spite of\r\nthese?\xe2\x80\x9d She swept her hand across a whole page of statesmen and\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn spite of them all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen gravely. She then put down her\r\nneedle, and explained a plan which had come into her head as they\r\ntalked. Instead of wandering on down the Amazons until she reached some\r\nsulphurous tropical port, where one had to lie within doors all day\r\nbeating off insects with a fan, the sensible thing to do surely was to\r\nspend the season with them in their villa by the seaside, where among\r\nother advantages Mrs. Ambrose herself would be at hand to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all,\r\nRachel,\xe2\x80\x9d she broke off, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s silly to pretend that because there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntwenty years\xe2\x80\x99 difference between us we therefore can\xe2\x80\x99t talk to each\r\nother like human beings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; because we like each other,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Ambrose agreed.\r\n\r\nThat fact, together with other facts, had been made clear by their\r\ntwenty minutes\xe2\x80\x99 talk, although how they had come to these conclusions\r\nthey could not have said.\r\n\r\nHowever they were come by, they were sufficiently serious to send Mrs.\r\nAmbrose a day or two later in search of her brother-in-law. She found\r\nhim sitting in his room working, applying a stout blue pencil\r\nauthoritatively to bundles of filmy paper. Papers lay to left and to\r\nright of him, there were great envelopes so gorged with papers that\r\nthey spilt papers on to the table. Above him hung a photograph of a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s head. The need of sitting absolutely still before a Cockney\r\nphotographer had given her lips a queer little pucker, and her eyes for\r\nthe same reason looked as though she thought the whole situation\r\nridiculous. Nevertheless it was the head of an individual and\r\ninteresting woman, who would no doubt have turned and laughed at\r\nWilloughby if she could have caught his eye; but when he looked up at\r\nher he sighed profoundly. In his mind this work of his, the great\r\nfactories at Hull which showed like mountains at night, the ships that\r\ncrossed the ocean punctually, the schemes for combining this and that\r\nand building up a solid mass of industry, was all an offering to her;\r\nhe laid his success at her feet; and was always thinking how to educate\r\nhis daughter so that Theresa might be glad. He was a very ambitious\r\nman; and although he had not been particularly kind to her while she\r\nlived, as Helen thought, he now believed that she watched him from\r\nHeaven, and inspired what was good in him.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ambrose apologised for the interruption, and asked whether she\r\nmight speak to him about a plan of hers. Would he consent to leave his\r\ndaughter with them when they landed, instead of taking her on up the\r\nAmazons?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe would take great care of her,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cand we should really\r\nlike it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilloughby looked very grave and carefully laid aside his papers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a good girl,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at length. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a likeness?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nnodded his head at the photograph of Theresa and sighed. Helen looked\r\nat Theresa pursing up her lips before the Cockney photographer. It\r\nsuggested her in an absurd human way, and she felt an intense desire to\r\nshare some joke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing that\xe2\x80\x99s left to me,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Willoughby. \xe2\x80\x9cWe go on\r\nyear after year without talking about these things\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He broke off. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s better so. Only life\xe2\x80\x99s very hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHelen was sorry for him, and patted him on the shoulder, but she felt\r\nuncomfortable when her brother-in-law expressed his feelings, and took\r\nrefuge in praising Rachel, and explaining why she thought her plan\r\nmight be a good one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Willoughby when she had done. \xe2\x80\x9cThe social conditions are\r\nbound to be primitive. I should be out a good deal. I agreed because\r\nshe wished it. And of course I have complete confidence in you. . . .\r\nYou see, Helen,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, becoming confidential, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to bring\r\nher up as her mother would have wished. I don\xe2\x80\x99t hold with these modern\r\nviews\xe2\x80\x94any more than you do, eh? She\xe2\x80\x99s a nice quiet girl, devoted to her\r\nmusic\xe2\x80\x94a little less of _that_ would do no harm. Still, it\xe2\x80\x99s kept her\r\nhappy, and we lead a very quiet life at Richmond. I should like her to\r\nbegin to see more people. I want to take her about with me when I get\r\nhome. I\xe2\x80\x99ve half a mind to rent a house in London, leaving my sisters at\r\nRichmond, and take her to see one or two people who\xe2\x80\x99d be kind to her\r\nfor my sake. I\xe2\x80\x99m beginning to realise,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, stretching\r\nhimself out, \xe2\x80\x9cthat all this is tending to Parliament, Helen. It\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nonly way to get things done as one wants them done. I talked to\r\nDalloway about it. In that case, of course, I should want Rachel to be\r\nable to take more part in things. A certain amount of entertaining\r\nwould be necessary\xe2\x80\x94dinners, an occasional evening party. One\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconstituents like to be fed, I believe. In all these ways Rachel could\r\nbe of great help to me. So,\xe2\x80\x9d he wound up, \xe2\x80\x9cI should be very glad, if we\r\narrange this visit (which must be upon a business footing, mind), if\r\nyou could see your way to helping my girl, bringing her out\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nlittle shy now,\xe2\x80\x94making a woman of her, the kind of woman her mother\r\nwould have liked her to be,\xe2\x80\x9d he ended, jerking his head at the\r\nphotograph.\r\n\r\nWilloughby\xe2\x80\x99s selfishness, though consistent as Helen saw with real\r\naffection for his daughter, made her determined to have the girl to\r\nstay with her, even if she had to promise a complete course of\r\ninstruction in the feminine graces. She could not help laughing at the\r\nnotion of it\xe2\x80\x94Rachel a Tory hostess!\xe2\x80\x94and marvelling as she left him at\r\nthe astonishing ignorance of a father.\r\n\r\nRachel, when consulted, showed less enthusiasm than Helen could have\r\nwished. One moment she was eager, the next doubtful. Visions of a great\r\nriver, now blue, now yellow in the tropical sun and crossed by bright\r\nbirds, now white in the moon, now deep in shade with moving trees and\r\ncanoes sliding out from the tangled banks, beset her. Helen promised a\r\nriver. Then she did not want to leave her father. That feeling seemed\r\ngenuine too, but in the end Helen prevailed, although when she had won\r\nher case she was beset by doubts, and more than once regretted the\r\nimpulse which had entangled her with the fortunes of another human\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a distance the _Euphrosyne_ looked very small. Glasses were turned\r\nupon her from the decks of great liners, and she was pronounced a\r\ntramp, a cargo-boat, or one of those wretched little passenger steamers\r\nwhere people rolled about among the cattle on deck. The insect-like\r\nfigures of Dalloways, Ambroses, and Vinraces were also derided, both\r\nfrom the extreme smallness of their persons and the doubt which only\r\nstrong glasses could dispel as to whether they were really live\r\ncreatures or only lumps on the rigging. Mr. Pepper with all his\r\nlearning had been mistaken for a cormorant, and then, as unjustly,\r\ntransformed into a cow. At night, indeed, when the waltzes were\r\nswinging in the saloon, and gifted passengers reciting, the little\r\nship\xe2\x80\x94shrunk to a few beads of light out among the dark waves, and one\r\nhigh in air upon the mast-head\xe2\x80\x94seemed something mysterious and\r\nimpressive to heated partners resting from the dance. She became a ship\r\npassing in the night\xe2\x80\x94an emblem of the loneliness of human life, an\r\noccasion for queer confidences and sudden appeals for sympathy.\r\n\r\nOn and on she went, by day and by night, following her path, until one\r\nmorning broke and showed the land. Losing its shadow-like appearance it\r\nbecame first cleft and mountainous, next coloured grey and purple, next\r\nscattered with white blocks which gradually separated themselves, and\r\nthen, as the progress of the ship acted upon the view like a\r\nfield-glass of increasing power, became streets of houses. By nine\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock the _Euphrosyne_ had taken up her position in the middle of a\r\ngreat bay; she dropped her anchor; immediately, as if she were a\r\nrecumbent giant requiring examination, small boats came swarming about\r\nher. She rang with cries; men jumped on to her; her deck was thumped by\r\nfeet. The lonely little island was invaded from all quarters at once,\r\nand after four weeks of silence it was bewildering to hear human\r\nspeech. Mrs. Ambrose alone heeded none of this stir. She was pale with\r\nsuspense while the boat with mail bags was making towards them.\r\nAbsorbed in her letters she did not notice that she had left the\r\n_Euphrosyne_, and felt no sadness when the ship lifted up her voice and\r\nbellowed thrice like a cow separated from its calf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe children are well!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. Mr. Pepper, who sat opposite\r\nwith a great mound of bag and rug upon his knees, said, \xe2\x80\x9cGratifying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nRachel, to whom the end of the voyage meant a complete change of\r\nperspective, was too much bewildered by the approach of the shore to\r\nrealise what children were well or why it was gratifying. Helen went on\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nMoving very slowly, and rearing absurdly high over each wave, the\r\nlittle boat was now approaching a white crescent of sand. Behind this\r\nwas a deep green valley, with distinct hills on either side. On the\r\nslope of the right-hand hill white houses with brown roofs were\r\nsettled, like nesting sea-birds, and at intervals cypresses striped the\r\nhill with black bars. Mountains whose sides were flushed with red, but\r\nwhose crowns were bald, rose as a pinnacle, half-concealing another\r\npinnacle behind it. The hour being still early, the whole view was\r\nexquisitely light and airy; the blues and greens of sky and tree were\r\nintense but not sultry. As they drew nearer and could distinguish\r\ndetails, the effect of the earth with its minute objects and colours\r\nand different forms of life was overwhelming after four weeks of the\r\nsea, and kept them silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree hundred years odd,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pepper meditatively at length.\r\n\r\nAs nobody said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d he merely extracted a bottle and swallowed a\r\npill. The piece of information that died within him was to the effect\r\nthat three hundred years ago five Elizabethan barques had anchored\r\nwhere the _Euphrosyne_ now floated. Half-drawn up upon the beach lay an\r\nequal number of Spanish galleons, unmanned, for the country was still a\r\nvirgin land behind a veil. Slipping across the water, the English\r\nsailors bore away bars of silver, bales of linen, timbers of cedar\r\nwood, golden crucifixes knobbed with emeralds. When the Spaniards came\r\ndown from their drinking, a fight ensued, the two parties churning up\r\nthe sand, and driving each other into the surf. The Spaniards, bloated\r\nwith fine living upon the fruits of the miraculous land, fell in heaps;\r\nbut the hardy Englishmen, tawny with sea-voyaging, hairy for lack of\r\nrazors, with muscles like wire, fangs greedy for flesh, and fingers\r\nitching for gold, despatched the wounded, drove the dying into the sea,\r\nand soon reduced the natives to a state of superstitious wonderment.\r\nHere a settlement was made; women were imported; children grew. All\r\nseemed to favour the expansion of the British Empire, and had there\r\nbeen men like Richard Dalloway in the time of Charles the First, the\r\nmap would undoubtedly be red where it is now an odious green. But it\r\nmust be supposed that the political mind of that age lacked\r\nimagination, and, merely for want of a few thousand pounds and a few\r\nthousand men, the spark died that should have been a conflagration.\r\nFrom the interior came Indians with subtle poisons, naked bodies, and\r\npainted idols; from the sea came vengeful Spaniards and rapacious\r\nPortuguese; exposed to all these enemies (though the climate proved\r\nwonderfully kind and the earth abundant) the English dwindled away and\r\nall but disappeared. Somewhere about the middle of the seventeenth\r\ncentury a single sloop watched its season and slipped out by night,\r\nbearing within it all that was left of the great British colony, a few\r\nmen, a few women, and perhaps a dozen dusky children. English history\r\nthen denies all knowledge of the place. Owing to one cause and another\r\ncivilisation shifted its centre to a spot some four or five hundred\r\nmiles to the south, and to-day Santa Marina is not much larger than it\r\nwas three hundred years ago. In population it is a happy compromise,\r\nfor Portuguese fathers wed Indian mothers, and their children\r\nintermarry with the Spanish. Although they get their ploughs from\r\nManchester, they make their coats from their own sheep, their silk from\r\ntheir own worms, and their furniture from their own cedar trees, so\r\nthat in arts and industries the place is still much where it was in\r\nElizabethan days.\r\n\r\nThe reasons which had drawn the English across the sea to found a small\r\ncolony within the last ten years are not so easily described, and will\r\nnever perhaps be recorded in history books. Granted facility of travel,\r\npeace, good trade, and so on, there was besides a kind of\r\ndissatisfaction among the English with the older countries and the\r\nenormous accumulations of carved stone, stained glass, and rich brown\r\npainting which they offered to the tourist. The movement in search of\r\nsomething new was of course infinitely small, affecting only a handful\r\nof well-to-do people. It began by a few schoolmasters serving their\r\npassage out to South America as the pursers of tramp steamers. They\r\nreturned in time for the summer term, when their stories of the\r\nsplendours and hardships of life at sea, the humours of sea-captains,\r\nthe wonders of night and dawn, and the marvels of the place delighted\r\noutsiders, and sometimes found their way into print. The country itself\r\ntaxed all their powers of description, for they said it was much bigger\r\nthan Italy, and really nobler than Greece. Again, they declared that\r\nthe natives were strangely beautiful, very big in stature, dark,\r\npassionate, and quick to seize the knife. The place seemed new and full\r\nof new forms of beauty, in proof of which they showed handkerchiefs\r\nwhich the women had worn round their heads, and primitive carvings\r\ncoloured bright greens and blues. Somehow or other, as fashions do, the\r\nfashion spread; an old monastery was quickly turned into a hotel, while\r\na famous line of steamships altered its route for the convenience of\r\npassengers.\r\n\r\nOddly enough it happened that the least satisfactory of Helen Ambrose\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrothers had been sent out years before to make his fortune, at any\r\nrate to keep clear of race-horses, in the very spot which had now\r\nbecome so popular. Often, leaning upon the column in the verandah, he\r\nhad watched the English ships with English schoolmasters for pursers\r\nsteaming into the bay. Having at length earned enough to take a\r\nholiday, and being sick of the place, he proposed to put his villa, on\r\nthe slope of the mountain, at his sister\xe2\x80\x99s disposal. She, too, had been\r\na little stirred by the talk of a new world, where there was always sun\r\nand never a fog, which went on around her, and the chance, when they\r\nwere planning where to spend the winter out of England, seemed too good\r\nto be missed. For these reasons she determined to accept Willoughby\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noffer of free passages on his ship, to place the children with their\r\ngrand-parents, and to do the thing thoroughly while she was about it.\r\n\r\nTaking seats in a carriage drawn by long-tailed horses with pheasants\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfeathers erect between their ears, the Ambroses, Mr. Pepper, and Rachel\r\nrattled out of the harbour. The day increased in heat as they drove up\r\nthe hill. The road passed through the town, where men seemed to be\r\nbeating brass and crying \xe2\x80\x9cWater,\xe2\x80\x9d where the passage was blocked by\r\nmules and cleared by whips and curses, where the women walked barefoot,\r\ntheir heads balancing baskets, and cripples hastily displayed mutilated\r\nmembers; it issued among steep green fields, not so green but that the\r\nearth showed through. Great trees now shaded all but the centre of the\r\nroad, and a mountain stream, so shallow and so swift that it plaited\r\nitself into strands as it ran, raced along the edge. Higher they went,\r\nuntil Ridley and Rachel walked behind; next they turned along a lane\r\nscattered with stones, where Mr. Pepper raised his stick and silently\r\nindicated a shrub, bearing among sparse leaves a voluminous purple\r\nblossom; and at a rickety canter the last stage of the way was\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nThe villa was a roomy white house, which, as is the case with most\r\ncontinental houses, looked to an English eye frail, ramshackle, and\r\nabsurdly frivolous, more like a pagoda in a tea-garden than a place\r\nwhere one slept. The garden called urgently for the services of\r\ngardener. Bushes waved their branches across the paths, and the blades\r\nof grass, with spaces of earth between them, could be counted. In the\r\ncircular piece of ground in front of the verandah were two cracked\r\nvases, from which red flowers drooped, with a stone fountain between\r\nthem, now parched in the sun. The circular garden led to a long garden,\r\nwhere the gardener\xe2\x80\x99s shears had scarcely been, unless now and then,\r\nwhen he cut a bough of blossom for his beloved. A few tall trees shaded\r\nit, and round bushes with wax-like flowers mobbed their heads together\r\nin a row. A garden smoothly laid with turf, divided by thick hedges,\r\nwith raised beds of bright flowers, such as we keep within walls in\r\nEngland, would have been out of place upon the side of this bare hill.\r\nThere was no ugliness to shut out, and the villa looked straight across\r\nthe shoulder of a slope, ribbed with olive trees, to the sea.\r\n\r\nThe indecency of the whole place struck Mrs. Chailey forcibly. There\r\nwere no blinds to shut out the sun, nor was there any furniture to\r\nspeak of for the sun to spoil. Standing in the bare stone hall, and\r\nsurveying a staircase of superb breadth, but cracked and carpetless,\r\nshe further ventured the opinion that there were rats, as large as\r\nterriers at home, and that if one put one\xe2\x80\x99s foot down with any force\r\none would come through the floor. As for hot water\xe2\x80\x94at this point her\r\ninvestigations left her speechless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor creature!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured to the sallow Spanish servant-girl who\r\ncame out with the pigs and hens to receive them, \xe2\x80\x9cno wonder you hardly\r\nlook like a human being!\xe2\x80\x9d Maria accepted the compliment with an\r\nexquisite Spanish grace. In Chailey\xe2\x80\x99s opinion they would have done\r\nbetter to stay on board an English ship, but none knew better than she\r\nthat her duty commanded her to stay.\r\n\r\nWhen they were settled in, and in train to find daily occupation, there\r\nwas some speculation as to the reasons which induced Mr. Pepper to\r\nstay, taking up his lodging in the Ambroses\xe2\x80\x99 house. Efforts had been\r\nmade for some days before landing to impress upon him the advantages of\r\nthe Amazons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat great stream!\xe2\x80\x9d Helen would begin, gazing as if she saw a\r\nvisionary cascade, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve a good mind to go with you myself,\r\nWilloughby\xe2\x80\x94only I can\xe2\x80\x99t. Think of the sunsets and the moonrises\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nbelieve the colours are unimaginable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are wild peacocks,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel hazarded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd marvellous creatures in the water,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen asserted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne might discover a new reptile,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s certain to be a revolution, I\xe2\x80\x99m told,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen urged.\r\n\r\nThe effect of these subterfuges was a little dashed by Ridley, who,\r\nafter regarding Pepper for some moments, sighed aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand inwardly speculated upon the unkindness of women.\r\n\r\nHe stayed, however, in apparent contentment for six days, playing with\r\na microscope and a notebook in one of the many sparsely furnished\r\nsitting-rooms, but on the evening of the seventh day, as they sat at\r\ndinner, he appeared more restless than usual. The dinner-table was set\r\nbetween two long windows which were left uncurtained by Helen\xe2\x80\x99s orders.\r\nDarkness fell as sharply as a knife in this climate, and the town then\r\nsprang out in circles and lines of bright dots beneath them. Buildings\r\nwhich never showed by day showed by night, and the sea flowed right\r\nover the land judging by the moving lights of the steamers. The sight\r\nfulfilled the same purpose as an orchestra in a London restaurant, and\r\nsilence had its setting. William Pepper observed it for some time; he\r\nput on his spectacles to contemplate the scene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve identified the big block to the left,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, and pointed\r\nwith his fork at a square formed by several rows of lights.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne should infer that they can cook vegetables,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn hotel?\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce a monastery,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pepper.\r\n\r\nNothing more was said then, but, the day after, Mr. Pepper returned\r\nfrom a midday walk, and stood silently before Helen who was reading in\r\nthe verandah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve taken a room over there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not going?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the whole\xe2\x80\x94yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cNo private cook _can_ cook\r\nvegetables.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKnowing his dislike of questions, which she to some extent shared,\r\nHelen asked no more. Still, an uneasy suspicion lurked in her mind that\r\nWilliam was hiding a wound. She flushed to think that her words, or her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s, or Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s had penetrated and stung. She was half-moved to\r\ncry, \xe2\x80\x9cStop, William; explain!\xe2\x80\x9d and would have returned to the subject\r\nat luncheon if William had not shown himself inscrutable and chill,\r\nlifting fragments of salad on the point of his fork, with the gesture\r\nof a man pronging seaweed, detecting gravel, suspecting germs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you all die of typhoid I won\xe2\x80\x99t be responsible!\xe2\x80\x9d he snapped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you die of dulness, neither will I,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen echoed in her heart.\r\n\r\nShe reflected that she had never yet asked him whether he had been in\r\nlove. They had got further and further from that subject instead of\r\ndrawing nearer to it, and she could not help feeling it a relief when\r\nWilliam Pepper, with all his knowledge, his microscope, his note-books,\r\nhis genuine kindliness and good sense, but a certain dryness of soul,\r\ntook his departure. Also she could not help feeling it sad that\r\nfriendships should end thus, although in this case to have the room\r\nempty was something of a comfort, and she tried to console herself with\r\nthe reflection that one never knows how far other people feel the\r\nthings they might be supposed to feel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next few months passed away, as many years can pass away, without\r\ndefinite events, and yet, if suddenly disturbed, it would be seen that\r\nsuch months or years had a character unlike others. The three months\r\nwhich had passed had brought them to the beginning of March. The\r\nclimate had kept its promise, and the change of season from winter to\r\nspring had made very little difference, so that Helen, who was sitting\r\nin the drawing-room with a pen in her hand, could keep the windows open\r\nthough a great fire of logs burnt on one side of her. Below, the sea\r\nwas still blue and the roofs still brown and white, though the day was\r\nfading rapidly. It was dusk in the room, which, large and empty at all\r\ntimes, now appeared larger and emptier than usual. Her own figure, as\r\nshe sat writing with a pad on her knee, shared the general effect of\r\nsize and lack of detail, for the flames which ran along the branches,\r\nsuddenly devouring little green tufts, burnt intermittently and sent\r\nirregular illuminations across her face and the plaster walls. There\r\nwere no pictures on the walls but here and there boughs laden with\r\nheavy-petalled flowers spread widely against them. Of the books fallen\r\non the bare floor and heaped upon the large table, it was only possible\r\nin this light to trace the outline.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ambrose was writing a very long letter. Beginning \xe2\x80\x9cDear Bernard,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nit went on to describe what had been happening in the Villa San\r\nGervasio during the past three months, as, for instance, that they had\r\nhad the British Consul to dinner, and had been taken over a Spanish\r\nman-of-war, and had seen a great many processions and religious\r\nfestivals, which were so beautiful that Mrs. Ambrose couldn\xe2\x80\x99t conceive\r\nwhy, if people must have a religion, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t all become Roman\r\nCatholics. They had made several expeditions though none of any length.\r\nIt was worth coming if only for the sake of the flowering trees which\r\ngrew wild quite near the house, and the amazing colours of sea and\r\nearth. The earth, instead of being brown, was red, purple, green. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t believe me,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no colour like it in England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe adopted, indeed, a condescending tone towards that poor island,\r\nwhich was now advancing chilly crocuses and nipped violets in nooks, in\r\ncopses, in cosy corners, tended by rosy old gardeners in mufflers, who\r\nwere always touching their hats and bobbing obsequiously. She went on\r\nto deride the islanders themselves. Rumours of London all in a ferment\r\nover a General Election had reached them even out here. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems\r\nincredible,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat people should care whether Asquith is\r\nin or Austen Chamberlain out, and while you scream yourselves hoarse\r\nabout politics you let the only people who are trying for something\r\ngood starve or simply laugh at them. When have you ever encouraged a\r\nliving artist? Or bought his best work? Why are you all so ugly and so\r\nservile? Here the servants are human beings. They talk to one as if\r\nthey were equals. As far as I can tell there are no aristocrats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was the mention of aristocrats that reminded her of Richard\r\nDalloway and Rachel, for she ran on with the same penful to describe\r\nher niece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an odd fate that has put me in charge of a girl,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cconsidering that I have never got on well with women, or had much to\r\ndo with them. However, I must retract some of the things that I have\r\nsaid against them. If they were properly educated I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why they\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be much the same as men\xe2\x80\x94as satisfactory I mean; though, of\r\ncourse, very different. The question is, how should one educate them.\r\nThe present method seems to me abominable. This girl, though\r\ntwenty-four, had never heard that men desired women, and, until I\r\nexplained it, did not know how children were born. Her ignorance upon\r\nother matters as important\xe2\x80\x9d (here Mrs. Ambrose\xe2\x80\x99s letter may not be\r\nquoted) . . . \xe2\x80\x9cwas complete. It seems to me not merely foolish but\r\ncriminal to bring people up like that. Let alone the suffering to them,\r\nit explains why women are what they are\xe2\x80\x94the wonder is they\xe2\x80\x99re no worse.\r\nI have taken it upon myself to enlighten her, and now, though still a\r\ngood deal prejudiced and liable to exaggerate, she is more or less a\r\nreasonable human being. Keeping them ignorant, of course, defeats its\r\nown object, and when they begin to understand they take it all much too\r\nseriously. My brother-in-law really deserved a catastrophe\xe2\x80\x94which he\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t get. I now pray for a young man to come to my help; some one, I\r\nmean, who would talk to her openly, and prove how absurd most of her\r\nideas about life are. Unluckily such men seem almost as rare as the\r\nwomen. The English colony certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t provide one; artists,\r\nmerchants, cultivated people\xe2\x80\x94they are stupid, conventional, and\r\nflirtatious. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d She ceased, and with her pen in her hand sat\r\nlooking into the fire, making the logs into caves and mountains, for it\r\nhad grown too dark to go on writing. Moreover, the house began to stir\r\nas the hour of dinner approached; she could hear the plates being\r\nchinked in the dining-room next door, and Chailey instructing the\r\nSpanish girl where to put things down in vigorous English. The bell\r\nrang; she rose, met Ridley and Rachel outside, and they all went in to\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nThree months had made but little difference in the appearance either of\r\nRidley or Rachel; yet a keen observer might have thought that the girl\r\nwas more definite and self-confident in her manner than before. Her\r\nskin was brown, her eyes certainly brighter, and she attended to what\r\nwas said as though she might be going to contradict it. The meal began\r\nwith the comfortable silence of people who are quite at their ease\r\ntogether. Then Ridley, leaning on his elbow and looking out of the\r\nwindow, observed that it was a lovely night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen. She added, \xe2\x80\x9cThe season\xe2\x80\x99s begun,\xe2\x80\x9d looking at the\r\nlights beneath them. She asked Maria in Spanish whether the hotel was\r\nnot filling up with visitors. Maria informed her with pride that there\r\nwould come a time when it was positively difficult to buy eggs\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nshopkeepers would not mind what prices they asked; they would get them,\r\nat any rate, from the English.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s an English steamer in the bay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel, looking at a\r\ntriangle of lights below. \xe2\x80\x9cShe came in early this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we may hope for some letters and send ours back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen.\r\n\r\nFor some reason the mention of letters always made Ridley groan, and\r\nthe rest of the meal passed in a brisk argument between husband and\r\nwife as to whether he was or was not wholly ignored by the entire\r\ncivilised world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsidering the last batch,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen, \xe2\x80\x9cyou deserve beating. You\r\nwere asked to lecture, you were offered a degree, and some silly woman\r\npraised not only your books but your beauty\xe2\x80\x94she said he was what\r\nShelley would have been if Shelley had lived to fifty-five and grown a\r\nbeard. Really, Ridley, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re the vainest man I know,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nended, rising from the table, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich I may tell you is saying a good\r\ndeal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFinding her letter lying before the fire she added a few lines to it,\r\nand then announced that she was going to take the letters now\xe2\x80\x94Ridley\r\nmust bring his\xe2\x80\x94and Rachel?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ve written to your Aunts? It\xe2\x80\x99s high time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe women put on cloaks and hats, and after inviting Ridley to come\r\nwith them, which he emphatically refused to do, exclaiming that Rachel\r\nhe expected to be a fool, but Helen surely knew better, they turned to\r\ngo. He stood over the fire gazing into the depths of the looking-glass,\r\nand compressing his face into the likeness of a commander surveying a\r\nfield of battle, or a martyr watching the flames lick his toes, rather\r\nthan that of a secluded Professor.\r\n\r\nHelen laid hold of his beard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I a fool?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go, Helen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I a fool?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVile woman!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, and kissed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you to your vanities,\xe2\x80\x9d she called back as they went out of\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful evening, still light enough to see a long way down\r\nthe road, though the stars were coming out. The pillar-box was let into\r\na high yellow wall where the lane met the road, and having dropped the\r\nletters into it, Helen was for turning back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel, taking her by the wrist. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to see\r\nlife. You promised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeeing life\xe2\x80\x9d was the phrase they used for their habit of strolling\r\nthrough the town after dark. The social life of Santa Marina was\r\ncarried on almost entirely by lamp-light, which the warmth of the\r\nnights and the scents culled from flowers made pleasant enough. The\r\nyoung women, with their hair magnificently swept in coils, a red flower\r\nbehind the ear, sat on the doorsteps, or issued out on to balconies,\r\nwhile the young men ranged up and down beneath, shouting up a greeting\r\nfrom time to time and stopping here and there to enter into amorous\r\ntalk. At the open windows merchants could be seen making up the day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccount, and older women lifting jars from shelf to shelf. The streets\r\nwere full of people, men for the most part, who interchanged their\r\nviews of the world as they walked, or gathered round the wine-tables at\r\nthe street corner, where an old cripple was twanging his guitar\r\nstrings, while a poor girl cried her passionate song in the gutter. The\r\ntwo Englishwomen excited some friendly curiosity, but no one molested\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHelen sauntered on, observing the different people in their shabby\r\nclothes, who seemed so careless and so natural, with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust think of the Mall to-night!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed at length. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nfifteenth of March. Perhaps there\xe2\x80\x99s a Court.\xe2\x80\x9d She thought of the crowd\r\nwaiting in the cold spring air to see the grand carriages go by. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvery cold, if it\xe2\x80\x99s not raining,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst there are men selling\r\npicture postcards; then there are wretched little shop-girls with round\r\nbandboxes; then there are bank clerks in tail coats; and then\xe2\x80\x94any\r\nnumber of dressmakers. People from South Kensington drive up in a hired\r\nfly; officials have a pair of bays; earls, on the other hand, are\r\nallowed one footman to stand up behind; dukes have two, royal dukes\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nI was told\xe2\x80\x94have three; the king, I suppose, can have as many as he\r\nlikes. And the people believe in it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOut here it seemed as though the people of England must be shaped in\r\nthe body like the kings and queens, knights and pawns of the\r\nchessboard, so strange were their differences, so marked and so\r\nimplicitly believed in.\r\n\r\nThey had to part in order to circumvent a crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey believe in God,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel as they regained each other. She\r\nmeant that the people in the crowd believed in Him; for she remembered\r\nthe crosses with bleeding plaster figures that stood where foot-paths\r\njoined, and the inexplicable mystery of a service in a Roman Catholic\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall never understand!\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed.\r\n\r\nThey had walked some way and it was now night, but they could see a\r\nlarge iron gate a little way farther down the road on their left.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to go right up to the hotel?\xe2\x80\x9d Helen asked.\r\n\r\nRachel gave the gate a push; it swung open, and, seeing no one about\r\nand judging that nothing was private in this country, they walked\r\nstraight on. An avenue of trees ran along the road, which was\r\ncompletely straight. The trees suddenly came to an end; the road turned\r\na corner, and they found themselves confronted by a large square\r\nbuilding. They had come out upon the broad terrace which ran round the\r\nhotel and were only a few feet distant from the windows. A row of long\r\nwindows opened almost to the ground. They were all of them uncurtained,\r\nand all brilliantly lighted, so that they could see everything inside.\r\nEach window revealed a different section of the life of the hotel. They\r\ndrew into one of the broad columns of shadow which separated the\r\nwindows and gazed in. They found themselves just outside the\r\ndining-room. It was being swept; a waiter was eating a bunch of grapes\r\nwith his leg across the corner of a table. Next door was the kitchen,\r\nwhere they were washing up; white cooks were dipping their arms into\r\ncauldrons, while the waiters made their meal voraciously off broken\r\nmeats, sopping up the gravy with bits of crumb. Moving on, they became\r\nlost in a plantation of bushes, and then suddenly found themselves\r\noutside the drawing-room, where the ladies and gentlemen, having dined\r\nwell, lay back in deep arm-chairs, occasionally speaking or turning\r\nover the pages of magazines. A thin woman was flourishing up and down\r\nthe piano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is a dahabeeyah, Charles?\xe2\x80\x9d the distinct voice of a widow, seated\r\nin an arm-chair by the window, asked her son.\r\n\r\nIt was the end of the piece, and his answer was lost in the general\r\nclearing of throats and tapping of knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re all old in this room,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel whispered.\r\n\r\nCreeping on, they found that the next window revealed two men in\r\nshirt-sleeves playing billiards with two young ladies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe pinched my arm!\xe2\x80\x9d the plump young woman cried, as she missed her\r\nstroke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you two\xe2\x80\x94no ragging,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man with the red face reproved\r\nthem, who was marking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care or we shall be seen,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Helen, plucking Rachel by\r\nthe arm. Incautiously her head had risen to the middle of the window.\r\n\r\nTurning the corner they came to the largest room in the hotel, which\r\nwas supplied with four windows, and was called the Lounge, although it\r\nwas really a hall. Hung with armour and native embroideries, furnished\r\nwith divans and screens, which shut off convenient corners, the room\r\nwas less formal than the others, and was evidently the haunt of youth.\r\nSignor Rodriguez, whom they knew to be the manager of the hotel, stood\r\nquite near them in the doorway surveying the scene\xe2\x80\x94the gentlemen\r\nlounging in chairs, the couples leaning over coffee-cups, the game of\r\ncards in the centre under profuse clusters of electric light. He was\r\ncongratulating himself upon the enterprise which had turned the\r\nrefectory, a cold stone room with pots on trestles, into the most\r\ncomfortable room in the house. The hotel was very full, and proved his\r\nwisdom in decreeing that no hotel can flourish without a lounge.\r\n\r\nThe people were scattered about in couples or parties of four, and\r\neither they were actually better acquainted, or the informal room made\r\ntheir manners easier. Through the open window came an uneven humming\r\nsound like that which rises from a flock of sheep pent within hurdles\r\nat dusk. The card-party occupied the centre of the foreground.\r\n\r\nHelen and Rachel watched them play for some minutes without being able\r\nto distinguish a word. Helen was observing one of the men intently. He\r\nwas a lean, somewhat cadaverous man of about her own age, whose profile\r\nwas turned to them, and he was the partner of a highly-coloured girl,\r\nobviously English by birth.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in the strange way in which some words detach themselves from\r\nthe rest, they heard him say quite distinctly:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll you want is practice, Miss Warrington; courage and practice\xe2\x80\x94one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno good without the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHughling Elliot! Of course!\xe2\x80\x9d Helen exclaimed. She ducked her head\r\nimmediately, for at the sound of his name he looked up. The game went\r\non for a few minutes, and was then broken up by the approach of a\r\nwheeled chair, containing a voluminous old lady who paused by the table\r\nand said:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter luck to-night, Susan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the luck\xe2\x80\x99s on our side,\xe2\x80\x9d said a young man who until now had kept\r\nhis back turned to the window. He appeared to be rather stout, and had\r\na thick crop of hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuck, Mr. Hewet?\xe2\x80\x9d said his partner, a middle-aged lady with\r\nspectacles. \xe2\x80\x9cI assure you, Mrs. Paley, our success is due solely to our\r\nbrilliant play.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless I go to bed early I get practically no sleep at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nPaley was heard to explain, as if to justify her seizure of Susan, who\r\ngot up and proceeded to wheel the chair to the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll get some one else to take my place,\xe2\x80\x9d she said cheerfully. But\r\nshe was wrong. No attempt was made to find another player, and after\r\nthe young man had built three stories of a card-house, which fell down,\r\nthe players strolled off in different directions.\r\n\r\nMr. Hewet turned his full face towards the window. They could see that\r\nhe had large eyes obscured by glasses; his complexion was rosy, his\r\nlips clean-shaven; and, seen among ordinary people, it appeared to be\r\nan interesting face. He came straight towards them, but his eyes were\r\nfixed not upon the eavesdroppers but upon a spot where the curtain hung\r\nin folds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsleep?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHelen and Rachel started to think that some one had been sitting near\r\nto them unobserved all the time. There were legs in the shadow. A\r\nmelancholy voice issued from above them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo women,\xe2\x80\x9d it said.\r\n\r\nA scuffling was heard on the gravel. The women had fled. They did not\r\nstop running until they felt certain that no eye could penetrate the\r\ndarkness and the hotel was only a square shadow in the distance, with\r\nred holes regularly cut in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nAn hour passed, and the downstairs rooms at the hotel grew dim and were\r\nalmost deserted, while the little box-like squares above them were\r\nbrilliantly irradiated. Some forty or fifty people were going to bed.\r\nThe thump of jugs set down on the floor above could be heard and the\r\nclink of china, for there was not as thick a partition between the\r\nrooms as one might wish, so Miss Allan, the elderly lady who had been\r\nplaying bridge, determined, giving the wall a smart rap with her\r\nknuckles. It was only matchboard, she decided, run up to make many\r\nlittle rooms of one large one. Her grey petticoats slipped to the\r\nground, and, stooping, she folded her clothes with neat, if not loving\r\nfingers, screwed her hair into a plait, wound her father\xe2\x80\x99s great gold\r\nwatch, and opened the complete works of Wordsworth. She was reading the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrelude,\xe2\x80\x9d partly because she always read the \xe2\x80\x9cPrelude\xe2\x80\x9d abroad, and\r\npartly because she was engaged in writing a short _Primer of English\r\nLiterature_\xe2\x80\x94_Beowulf to Swinburne_\xe2\x80\x94which would have a paragraph on\r\nWordsworth. She was deep in the fifth book, stopping indeed to pencil a\r\nnote, when a pair of boots dropped, one after another, on the floor\r\nabove her. She looked up and speculated. Whose boots were they, she\r\nwondered. She then became aware of a swishing sound next door\xe2\x80\x94a woman,\r\nclearly, putting away her dress. It was succeeded by a gentle tapping\r\nsound, such as that which accompanies hair-dressing. It was very\r\ndifficult to keep her attention fixed upon the \xe2\x80\x9cPrelude.\xe2\x80\x9d Was it Susan\r\nWarrington tapping? She forced herself, however, to read to the end of\r\nthe book, when she placed a mark between the pages, sighed contentedly,\r\nand then turned out the light.\r\n\r\nVery different was the room through the wall, though as like in shape\r\nas one egg-box is like another. As Miss Allan read her book, Susan\r\nWarrington was brushing her hair. Ages have consecrated this hour, and\r\nthe most majestic of all domestic actions, to talk of love between\r\nwomen; but Miss Warrington being alone could not talk; she could only\r\nlook with extreme solicitude at her own face in the glass. She turned\r\nher head from side to side, tossing heavy locks now this way now that;\r\nand then withdrew a pace or two, and considered herself seriously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m nice-looking,\xe2\x80\x9d she determined. \xe2\x80\x9cNot pretty\xe2\x80\x94possibly,\xe2\x80\x9d she drew\r\nherself up a little. \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94most people would say I was handsome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was really wondering what Arthur Venning would say she was. Her\r\nfeeling about him was decidedly queer. She would not admit to herself\r\nthat she was in love with him or that she wanted to marry him, yet she\r\nspent every minute when she was alone in wondering what he thought of\r\nher, and in comparing what they had done to-day with what they had done\r\nthe day before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask me to play, but he certainly followed me into the hall,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe meditated, summing up the evening. She was thirty years of age, and\r\nowing to the number of her sisters and the seclusion of life in a\r\ncountry parsonage had as yet had no proposal of marriage. The hour of\r\nconfidences was often a sad one, and she had been known to jump into\r\nbed, treating her hair unkindly, feeling herself overlooked by life in\r\ncomparison with others. She was a big, well-made woman, the red lying\r\nupon her cheeks in patches that were too well defined, but her serious\r\nanxiety gave her a kind of beauty.\r\n\r\nShe was just about to pull back the bed-clothes when she exclaimed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but I\xe2\x80\x99m forgetting,\xe2\x80\x9d and went to her writing-table. A brown volume\r\nlay there stamped with the figure of the year. She proceeded to write\r\nin the square ugly hand of a mature child, as she wrote daily year\r\nafter year, keeping the diaries, though she seldom looked at them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA.M.\xe2\x80\x94Talked to Mrs. H. Elliot about country neighbours. She knows the\r\nManns; also the Selby-Carroways. How small the world is! Like her. Read\r\na chapter of _Miss Appleby\xe2\x80\x99s Adventure_ to Aunt E. P.M.\xe2\x80\x94Played\r\nlawn-tennis with Mr. Perrott and Evelyn M. Don\xe2\x80\x99t _like_ Mr. P. Have a\r\nfeeling that he is not \xe2\x80\x98quite,\xe2\x80\x99 though clever certainly. Beat them. Day\r\nsplendid, view wonderful. One gets used to no trees, though much too\r\nbare at first. Cards after dinner. Aunt E. cheerful, though twingy, she\r\nsays. Mem.: _ask about damp sheets_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe knelt in prayer, and then lay down in bed, tucking the blankets\r\ncomfortably about her, and in a few minutes her breathing showed that\r\nshe was asleep. With its profoundly peaceful sighs and hesitations it\r\nresembled that of a cow standing up to its knees all night through in\r\nthe long grass.\r\n\r\nA glance into the next room revealed little more than a nose, prominent\r\nabove the sheets. Growing accustomed to the darkness, for the windows\r\nwere open and showed grey squares with splinters of starlight, one\r\ncould distinguish a lean form, terribly like the body of a dead person,\r\nthe body indeed of William Pepper, asleep too. Thirty-six,\r\nthirty-seven, thirty-eight\xe2\x80\x94here were three Portuguese men of business,\r\nasleep presumably, since a snore came with the regularity of a great\r\nticking clock. Thirty-nine was a corner room, at the end of the\r\npassage, but late though it was\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOne\xe2\x80\x9d struck gently downstairs\xe2\x80\x94a line\r\nof light under the door showed that some one was still awake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow late you are, Hugh!\xe2\x80\x9d a woman, lying in bed, said in a peevish but\r\nsolicitous voice. Her husband was brushing his teeth, and for some\r\nmoments did not answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have gone to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI was talking to\r\nThornbury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you know that I never can sleep when I\xe2\x80\x99m waiting for you,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nTo that he made no answer, but only remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cWell then, we\xe2\x80\x99ll turn\r\nout the light.\xe2\x80\x9d They were silent.\r\n\r\nThe faint but penetrating pulse of an electric bell could now be heard\r\nin the corridor. Old Mrs. Paley, having woken hungry but without her\r\nspectacles, was summoning her maid to find the biscuit-box. The maid\r\nhaving answered the bell, drearily respectful even at this hour though\r\nmuffled in a mackintosh, the passage was left in silence. Downstairs\r\nall was empty and dark; but on the upper floor a light still burnt in\r\nthe room where the boots had dropped so heavily above Miss Allan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead. Here was the gentleman who, a few hours previously, in the shade\r\nof the curtain, had seemed to consist entirely of legs. Deep in an\r\narm-chair he was reading the third volume of Gibbon\xe2\x80\x99s _History of the\r\nDecline and Fall of Rome_ by candle-light. As he read he knocked the\r\nash automatically, now and again, from his cigarette and turned the\r\npage, while a whole procession of splendid sentences entered his\r\ncapacious brow and went marching through his brain in order. It seemed\r\nlikely that this process might continue for an hour or more, until the\r\nentire regiment had shifted its quarters, had not the door opened, and\r\nthe young man, who was inclined to be stout, come in with large naked\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Hirst, what I forgot to say was\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst, raising his finger.\r\n\r\nHe safely stowed away the last words of the paragraph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it you forgot to say?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you think you _do_ make enough allowance for feelings?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr.\r\nHewet. He had again forgotten what he had meant to say.\r\n\r\nAfter intense contemplation of the immaculate Gibbon Mr. Hirst smiled\r\nat the question of his friend. He laid aside his book and considered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should call yours a singularly untidy mind,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed. \xe2\x80\x9cFeelings?\r\nAren\xe2\x80\x99t they just what we do allow for? We put love up there, and all\r\nthe rest somewhere down below.\xe2\x80\x9d With his left hand he indicated the top\r\nof a pyramid, and with his right the base.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you didn\xe2\x80\x99t get out of bed to tell me that,\xe2\x80\x9d he added severely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got out of bed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet vaguely, \xe2\x80\x9cmerely to talk I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeanwhile I shall undress,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst. When naked of all but his\r\nshirt, and bent over the basin, Mr. Hirst no longer impressed one with\r\nthe majesty of his intellect, but with the pathos of his young yet ugly\r\nbody, for he stooped, and he was so thin that there were dark lines\r\nbetween the different bones of his neck and shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen interest me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet, who, sitting on the bed with his chin\r\nresting on his knees, paid no attention to the undressing of Mr. Hirst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re so stupid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re sitting on my pyjamas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose they _are_ stupid?\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet wondered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere can\xe2\x80\x99t be two opinions about that, I imagine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst,\r\nhopping briskly across the room, \xe2\x80\x9cunless you\xe2\x80\x99re in love\xe2\x80\x94that fat woman\r\nWarrington?\xe2\x80\x9d he enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot one fat woman\xe2\x80\x94all fat women,\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe women I saw to-night were not fat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst, who was taking\r\nadvantage of Hewet\xe2\x80\x99s company to cut his toe-nails.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDescribe them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I can\xe2\x80\x99t describe things!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were much like\r\nother women, I should think. They always are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; that\xe2\x80\x99s where we differ,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet. \xe2\x80\x9cI say everything\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndifferent. No two people are in the least the same. Take you and me\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I used to think once,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst. \xe2\x80\x9cBut now they\xe2\x80\x99re all types.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t take us,\xe2\x80\x94take this hotel. You could draw circles round the whole\r\nlot of them, and they\xe2\x80\x99d never stray outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cYou can kill a hen by doing that\xe2\x80\x9d), Hewet murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Hughling Elliot, Mrs. Hughling Elliot, Miss Allan, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nThornbury\xe2\x80\x94one circle,\xe2\x80\x9d Hirst continued. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Warrington, Mr. Arthur\r\nVenning, Mr. Perrott, Evelyn M. another circle; then there are a whole\r\nlot of natives; finally ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we all alone in our circle?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hewet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst. \xe2\x80\x9cYou try to get out, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t. You only\r\nmake a mess of things by trying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a hen in a circle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a dove on a tree-top.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if this is what they call an ingrowing toe-nail?\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst,\r\nexamining the big toe on his left foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI flit from branch to branch,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Hewet. \xe2\x80\x9cThe world is\r\nprofoundly pleasant.\xe2\x80\x9d He lay back on the bed, upon his arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if it\xe2\x80\x99s really nice to be as vague as you are?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hirst,\r\nlooking at him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the lack of continuity\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s so odd about\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the age of twenty-seven, which is nearly thirty,\r\nyou seem to have drawn no conclusions. A party of old women excites you\r\nstill as though you were three.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHewet contemplated the angular young man who was neatly brushing the\r\nrims of his toe-nails into the fire-place in silence for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI respect you, Hirst,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI envy you\xe2\x80\x94some things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst. \xe2\x80\x9cOne: your capacity for not\r\nthinking; two: people like you better than they like me. Women like\r\nyou, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder whether that isn\xe2\x80\x99t really what matters most?\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet.\r\nLying now flat on the bed he waved his hand in vague circles above him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s not the difficulty. The\r\ndifficulty is, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, to find an appropriate object?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no female hens in your circle?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hewet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the ghost of one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst.\r\n\r\nAlthough they had known each other for three years Hirst had never yet\r\nheard the true story of Hewet\xe2\x80\x99s loves. In general conversation it was\r\ntaken for granted that they were many, but in private the subject was\r\nallowed to lapse. The fact that he had money enough to do no work, and\r\nthat he had left Cambridge after two terms owing to a difference with\r\nthe authorities, and had then travelled and drifted, made his life\r\nstrange at many points where his friends\xe2\x80\x99 lives were much of a piece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see your circles\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t see them,\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI see a\r\nthing like a teetotum spinning in and out\xe2\x80\x94knocking into things\xe2\x80\x94dashing\r\nfrom side to side\xe2\x80\x94collecting numbers\xe2\x80\x94more and more and more, till the\r\nwhole place is thick with them. Round and round they go\xe2\x80\x94out there, over\r\nthe rim\xe2\x80\x94out of sight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis fingers showed that the waltzing teetotums had spun over the edge\r\nof the counterpane and fallen off the bed into infinity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould you contemplate three weeks alone in this hotel?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hirst,\r\nafter a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause.\r\n\r\nHewet proceeded to think.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe truth of it is that one never is alone, and one never is in\r\ncompany,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeaning?\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeaning? Oh, something about bubbles\xe2\x80\x94auras\xe2\x80\x94what d\xe2\x80\x99you call \xe2\x80\x99em? You\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t see my bubble; I can\xe2\x80\x99t see yours; all we see of each other is a\r\nspeck, like the wick in the middle of that flame. The flame goes about\r\nwith us everywhere; it\xe2\x80\x99s not ourselves exactly, but what we feel; the\r\nworld is short, or people mainly; all kinds of people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA nice streaky bubble yours must be!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd supposing my bubble could run into some one else\xe2\x80\x99s bubble\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they both burst?\xe2\x80\x9d put in Hirst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen\xe2\x80\x94then\xe2\x80\x94then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d pondered Hewet, as if to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cit would be an\r\ne-nor-mous world,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, stretching his arms to their full width, as\r\nthough even so they could hardly clasp the billowy universe, for when\r\nhe was with Hirst he always felt unusually sanguine and vague.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you altogether as foolish as I used to, Hewet,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHirst. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean but you try to say it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut aren\xe2\x80\x99t you enjoying yourself here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hewet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the whole\xe2\x80\x94yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst. \xe2\x80\x9cI like observing people. I like\r\nlooking at things. This country is amazingly beautiful. Did you notice\r\nhow the top of the mountain turned yellow to-night? Really we must take\r\nour lunch and spend the day out. You\xe2\x80\x99re getting disgustingly fat.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\npointed at the calf of Hewet\xe2\x80\x99s bare leg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll get up an expedition,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet energetically. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll ask the\r\nentire hotel. We\xe2\x80\x99ll hire donkeys and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst, \xe2\x80\x9cdo shut it! I can see Miss Warrington and Miss\r\nAllan and Mrs. Elliot and the rest squatting on the stones and\r\nquacking, \xe2\x80\x98How jolly!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll ask Venning and Perrott and Miss Murgatroyd\xe2\x80\x94every one we can lay\r\nhands on,\xe2\x80\x9d went on Hewet. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the name of the little old\r\ngrasshopper with the eyeglasses? Pepper?\xe2\x80\x94Pepper shall lead us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God, you\xe2\x80\x99ll never get the donkeys,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must make a note of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet, slowly dropping his feet to\r\nthe floor. \xe2\x80\x9cHirst escorts Miss Warrington; Pepper advances alone on a\r\nwhite ass; provisions equally distributed\xe2\x80\x94or shall we hire a mule? The\r\nmatrons\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs. Paley, by Jove!\xe2\x80\x94share a carriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where you\xe2\x80\x99ll go wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst. \xe2\x80\x9cPutting virgins among\r\nmatrons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long should you think that an expedition like that would take,\r\nHirst?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hewet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom twelve to sixteen hours I would say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst. \xe2\x80\x9cThe time\r\nusually occupied by a first confinement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will need considerable organisation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet. He was now\r\npadding softly round the room, and stopped to stir the books on the\r\ntable. They lay heaped one upon another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall want some poets too,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cNot Gibbon; no; d\xe2\x80\x99you\r\nhappen to have _Modern Love_ or _John Donne_? You see, I contemplate\r\npauses when people get tired of looking at the view, and then it would\r\nbe nice to read something rather difficult aloud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Paley _will_ enjoy herself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Paley will enjoy it certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s one of the\r\nsaddest things I know\xe2\x80\x94the way elderly ladies cease to read poetry. And\r\nyet how appropriate this is:\r\n\r\nI speak as one who plumbs\r\n    Life\xe2\x80\x99s dim profound,\r\nOne who at length can sound\r\n    Clear views and certain.\r\nBut\xe2\x80\x94after love what comes?\r\n    A scene that lours,\r\nA few sad vacant hours,\r\n    And then, the Curtain.\r\n\r\n\r\nI daresay Mrs. Paley is the only one of us who can really understand\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll ask her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, Hewet, if you must go to bed,\r\ndraw my curtain. Few things distress me more than the moonlight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHewet retreated, pressing the poems of Thomas Hardy beneath his arm,\r\nand in their beds next door to each other both the young men were soon\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nBetween the extinction of Hewet\xe2\x80\x99s candle and the rising of a dusky\r\nSpanish boy who was the first to survey the desolation of the hotel in\r\nthe early morning, a few hours of silence intervened. One could almost\r\nhear a hundred people breathing deeply, and however wakeful and\r\nrestless it would have been hard to escape sleep in the middle of so\r\nmuch sleep. Looking out of the windows, there was only darkness to be\r\nseen. All over the shadowed half of the world people lay prone, and a\r\nfew flickering lights in empty streets marked the places where their\r\ncities were built. Red and yellow omnibuses were crowding each other in\r\nPiccadilly; sumptuous women were rocking at a standstill; but here in\r\nthe darkness an owl flitted from tree to tree, and when the breeze\r\nlifted the branches the moon flashed as if it were a torch. Until all\r\npeople should awake again the houseless animals were abroad, the tigers\r\nand the stags, and the elephants coming down in the darkness to drink\r\nat pools. The wind at night blowing over the hills and woods was purer\r\nand fresher than the wind by day, and the earth, robbed of detail, more\r\nmysterious than the earth coloured and divided by roads and fields. For\r\nsix hours this profound beauty existed, and then as the east grew\r\nwhiter and whiter the ground swam to the surface, the roads were\r\nrevealed, the smoke rose and the people stirred, and the sun shone upon\r\nthe windows of the hotel at Santa Marina until they were uncurtained,\r\nand the gong blaring all through the house gave notice of breakfast.\r\n\r\nDirectly breakfast was over, the ladies as usual circled vaguely,\r\npicking up papers and putting them down again, about the hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what are you going to do to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Elliot drifting up\r\nagainst Miss Warrington.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elliot, the wife of Hughling the Oxford Don, was a short woman,\r\nwhose expression was habitually plaintive. Her eyes moved from thing to\r\nthing as though they never found anything sufficiently pleasant to rest\r\nupon for any length of time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to try to get Aunt Emma out into the town,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not seen a thing yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI call it so spirited of her at her age,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Elliot, \xe2\x80\x9ccoming\r\nall this way from her own fireside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we always tell her she\xe2\x80\x99ll die on board ship,\xe2\x80\x9d Susan replied. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nwas born on one,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the old days,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Elliot, \xe2\x80\x9ca great many people were. I\r\nalways pity the poor women so! We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot to complain of!\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nshook her head. Her eyes wandered about the table, and she remarked\r\nirrelevantly, \xe2\x80\x9cThe poor little Queen of Holland! Newspaper reporters\r\npractically, one may say, at her bedroom door!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you talking of the Queen of Holland?\xe2\x80\x9d said the pleasant voice of\r\nMiss Allan, who was searching for the thick pages of _The Times_ among\r\na litter of thin foreign sheets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always envy any one who lives in such an excessively flat country,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow very strange!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Elliot. \xe2\x80\x9cI find a flat country so\r\ndepressing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you can\xe2\x80\x99t be very happy here then, Miss Allan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Allan, \xe2\x80\x9cI am exceedingly fond of\r\nmountains.\xe2\x80\x9d Perceiving _The Times_ at some distance, she moved off to\r\nsecure it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I must find my husband,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Elliot, fidgeting away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I must go to my aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Warrington, and taking up the\r\nduties of the day they moved away.\r\n\r\nWhether the flimsiness of foreign sheets and the coarseness of their\r\ntype is any proof of frivolity and ignorance, there is no doubt that\r\nEnglish people scarce consider news read there as news, any more than a\r\nprogramme bought from a man in the street inspires confidence in what\r\nit says. A very respectable elderly pair, having inspected the long\r\ntables of newspapers, did not think it worth their while to read more\r\nthan the headlines.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe debate on the fifteenth should have reached us by now,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nThornbury murmured. Mr. Thornbury, who was beautifully clean and had\r\nred rubbed into his handsome worn face like traces of paint on a\r\nweather-beaten wooden figure, looked over his glasses and saw that Miss\r\nAllan had _The Times_.\r\n\r\nThe couple therefore sat themselves down in arm-chairs and waited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Hewet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Thornbury. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Hewet,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cdo come and sit by us. I was telling my husband how much\r\nyou reminded me of a dear old friend of mine\xe2\x80\x94Mary Umpleby. She was a\r\nmost delightful woman, I assure you. She grew roses. We used to stay\r\nwith her in the old days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo young man likes to have it said that he resembles an elderly\r\nspinster,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Thornbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Hewet, \xe2\x80\x9cI always think it a compliment to\r\nremind people of some one else. But Miss Umpleby\xe2\x80\x94why did she grow\r\nroses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, poor thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Thornbury, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s a long story. She had\r\ngone through dreadful sorrows. At one time I think she would have lost\r\nher senses if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for her garden. The soil was very much\r\nagainst her\xe2\x80\x94a blessing in disguise; she had to be up at dawn\xe2\x80\x94out in all\r\nweathers. And then there are creatures that eat roses. But she\r\ntriumphed. She always did. She was a brave soul.\xe2\x80\x9d She sighed deeply but\r\nat the same time with resignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not realise that I was monopolising the paper,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Allan,\r\ncoming up to them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were so anxious to read about the debate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Thornbury,\r\naccepting it on behalf of her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne doesn\xe2\x80\x99t realise how interesting a debate can be until one has sons\r\nin the navy. My interests are equally balanced, though; I have sons in\r\nthe army too; and one son who makes speeches at the Union\xe2\x80\x94my baby!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHirst would know him, I expect,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Hirst has such an interesting face,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Thornbury. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\nfeel one ought to be very clever to talk to him. Well, William?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nenquired, for Mr. Thornbury grunted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re making a mess of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Thornbury. He had reached the\r\nsecond column of the report, a spasmodic column, for the Irish members\r\nhad been brawling three weeks ago at Westminster over a question of\r\nnaval efficiency. After a disturbed paragraph or two, the column of\r\nprint once more ran smoothly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have read it?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Thornbury asked Miss Allan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am ashamed to say I have only read about the discoveries in\r\nCrete,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Allan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but I would give so much to realise the ancient world!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs.\r\nThornbury. \xe2\x80\x9cNow that we old people are alone,\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99re on our second\r\nhoneymoon,\xe2\x80\x94I am really going to put myself to school again. After all\r\nwe are _founded_ on the past, aren\xe2\x80\x99t we, Mr. Hewet? My soldier son says\r\nthat there is still a great deal to be learnt from Hannibal. One ought\r\nto know so much more than one does. Somehow when I read the paper, I\r\nbegin with the debates first, and, before I\xe2\x80\x99ve done, the door always\r\nopens\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99re a very large party at home\xe2\x80\x94and so one never does think\r\nenough about the ancients and all they\xe2\x80\x99ve done for us. But _you_ begin\r\nat the beginning, Miss Allan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I think of the Greeks I think of them as naked black men,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMiss Allan, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is quite incorrect, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, Mr. Hirst?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Thornbury, perceiving that the gaunt\r\nyoung man was near. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you read everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI confine myself to cricket and crime,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst. \xe2\x80\x9cThe worst of\r\ncoming from the upper classes,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cis that one\xe2\x80\x99s friends\r\nare never killed in railway accidents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Thornbury threw down the paper, and emphatically dropped his\r\neyeglasses. The sheets fell in the middle of the group, and were eyed\r\nby them all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not gone well?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his wife solicitously.\r\n\r\nHewet picked up one sheet and read, \xe2\x80\x9cA lady was walking yesterday in\r\nthe streets of Westminster when she perceived a cat in the window of a\r\ndeserted house. The famished animal\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be out of it anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Thornbury interrupted peevishly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCats are often forgotten,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Allan remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember, William, the Prime Minister has reserved his answer,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Thornbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the age of eighty, Mr. Joshua Harris of Eeles Park, Brondesbury,\r\nhas had a son,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c. . . The famished animal, which had been noticed by workmen for some\r\ndays, was rescued, but\xe2\x80\x94by Jove! it bit the man\xe2\x80\x99s hand to pieces!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWild with hunger, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d commented Miss Allan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re all neglecting the chief advantage of being abroad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nHughling Elliot, who had joined the group. \xe2\x80\x9cYou might read your news in\r\nFrench, which is equivalent to reading no news at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Elliot had a profound knowledge of Coptic, which he concealed as\r\nfar as possible, and quoted French phrases so exquisitely that it was\r\nhard to believe that he could also speak the ordinary tongue. He had an\r\nimmense respect for the French.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComing?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked the two young men. \xe2\x80\x9cWe ought to start before it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreally hot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg of you not to walk in the heat, Hugh,\xe2\x80\x9d his wife pleaded, giving\r\nhim an angular parcel enclosing half a chicken and some raisins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHewet will be our barometer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Elliot. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will melt before I\r\nshall.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed, if so much as a drop had melted off his spare ribs, the\r\nbones would have lain bare. The ladies were left alone now, surrounding\r\n_The Times_ which lay upon the floor. Miss Allan looked at her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen minutes to eleven,\xe2\x80\x9d she observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWork?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Thornbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWork,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Allan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fine creature she is!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mrs. Thornbury, as the square\r\nfigure in its manly coat withdrew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she has a hard life,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Mrs. Elliot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it _is_ a hard life,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Thornbury. \xe2\x80\x9cUnmarried\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x94earning their livings\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s the hardest life of all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet she seems pretty cheerful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Elliot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be very interesting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Thornbury. \xe2\x80\x9cI envy her her\r\nknowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that isn\xe2\x80\x99t what women want,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Elliot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it\xe2\x80\x99s all a great many can hope to have,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Mrs.\r\nThornbury. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe that there are more of us than ever now. Sir\r\nHarley Lethbridge was telling me only the other day how difficult it is\r\nto find boys for the navy\xe2\x80\x94partly because of their teeth, it is true.\r\nAnd I have heard young women talk quite openly of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDreadful, dreadful!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs. Elliot. \xe2\x80\x9cThe crown, as one may\r\ncall it, of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s life. I, who know what it is to be childless\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe sighed and ceased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we must not be hard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Thornbury. \xe2\x80\x9cThe conditions are so\r\nmuch changed since I was a young woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely _maternity_ does not change,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Elliot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn some ways we can learn a great deal from the young,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nThornbury. \xe2\x80\x9cI learn so much from my own daughters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe that Hughling really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Elliot. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nthen he has his work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen without children can do so much for the children of others,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nobserved Mrs. Thornbury gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sketch a great deal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Elliot, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that isn\xe2\x80\x99t really an\r\noccupation. It\xe2\x80\x99s so disconcerting to find girls just beginning doing\r\nbetter than one does oneself! And nature\xe2\x80\x99s difficult\xe2\x80\x94very difficult!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre there not institutions\xe2\x80\x94clubs\xe2\x80\x94that you could help?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs.\r\nThornbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are so exhausting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Elliot. \xe2\x80\x9cI look strong, because of\r\nmy colour; but I\xe2\x80\x99m not; the youngest of eleven never is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the mother is careful before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Thornbury judicially,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere is no reason why the size of the family should make any\r\ndifference. And there is no training like the training that brothers\r\nand sisters give each other. I am sure of that. I have seen it with my\r\nown children. My eldest boy Ralph, for instance\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Elliot was inattentive to the elder lady\xe2\x80\x99s experience, and her\r\neyes wandered about the hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother had two miscarriages, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first\r\nbecause she met one of those great dancing bears\xe2\x80\x94they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nallowed; the other\xe2\x80\x94it was a horrid story\xe2\x80\x94our cook had a child and there\r\nwas a dinner party. So I put my dyspepsia down to that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a miscarriage is so much worse than a confinement,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Thornbury\r\nmurmured absentmindedly, adjusting her spectacles and picking up _The\r\nTimes_. Mrs. Elliot rose and fluttered away.\r\n\r\nWhen she had heard what one of the million voices speaking in the paper\r\nhad to say, and noticed that a cousin of hers had married a clergyman\r\nat Minehead\xe2\x80\x94ignoring the drunken women, the golden animals of Crete,\r\nthe movements of battalions, the dinners, the reforms, the fires, the\r\nindignant, the learned and benevolent, Mrs. Thornbury went upstairs to\r\nwrite a letter for the mail.\r\n\r\nThe paper lay directly beneath the clock, the two together seeming to\r\nrepresent stability in a changing world. Mr. Perrott passed through;\r\nMr. Venning poised for a second on the edge of a table. Mrs. Paley was\r\nwheeled past. Susan followed. Mr. Venning strolled after her.\r\nPortuguese military families, their clothes suggesting late rising in\r\nuntidy bedrooms, trailed across, attended by confidential nurses\r\ncarrying noisy children. As midday drew on, and the sun beat straight\r\nupon the roof, an eddy of great flies droned in a circle; iced drinks\r\nwere served under the palms; the long blinds were pulled down with a\r\nshriek, turning all the light yellow. The clock now had a silent hall\r\nto tick in, and an audience of four or five somnolent merchants. By\r\ndegrees white figures with shady hats came in at the door, admitting a\r\nwedge of the hot summer day, and shutting it out again. After resting\r\nin the dimness for a minute, they went upstairs. Simultaneously, the\r\nclock wheezed one, and the gong sounded, beginning softly, working\r\nitself into a frenzy, and ceasing. There was a pause. Then all those\r\nwho had gone upstairs came down; cripples came, planting both feet on\r\nthe same step lest they should slip; prim little girls came, holding\r\nthe nurse\xe2\x80\x99s finger; fat old men came still buttoning waistcoats. The\r\ngong had been sounded in the garden, and by degrees recumbent figures\r\nrose and strolled in to eat, since the time had come for them to feed\r\nagain. There were pools and bars of shade in the garden even at midday,\r\nwhere two or three visitors could lie working or talking at their ease.\r\n\r\nOwing to the heat of the day, luncheon was generally a silent meal,\r\nwhen people observed their neighbors and took stock of any new faces\r\nthere might be, hazarding guesses as to who they were and what they\r\ndid. Mrs. Paley, although well over seventy and crippled in the legs,\r\nenjoyed her food and the peculiarities of her fellow-beings. She was\r\nseated at a small table with Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to say what _she_ is!\xe2\x80\x9d she chuckled, surveying a tall\r\nwoman dressed conspicuously in white, with paint in the hollows of her\r\ncheeks, who was always late, and always attended by a shabby female\r\nfollower, at which remark Susan blushed, and wondered why her aunt said\r\nsuch things.\r\n\r\nLunch went on methodically, until each of the seven courses was left in\r\nfragments and the fruit was merely a toy, to be peeled and sliced as a\r\nchild destroys a daisy, petal by petal. The food served as an\r\nextinguisher upon any faint flame of the human spirit that might\r\nsurvive the midday heat, but Susan sat in her room afterwards, turning\r\nover and over the delightful fact that Mr. Venning had come to her in\r\nthe garden, and had sat there quite half an hour while she read aloud\r\nto her aunt. Men and women sought different corners where they could\r\nlie unobserved, and from two to four it might be said without\r\nexaggeration that the hotel was inhabited by bodies without souls.\r\nDisastrous would have been the result if a fire or a death had suddenly\r\ndemanded something heroic of human nature, but tragedies come in the\r\nhungry hours. Towards four o\xe2\x80\x99clock the human spirit again began to lick\r\nthe body, as a flame licks a black promontory of coal. Mrs. Paley felt\r\nit unseemly to open her toothless jaw so widely, though there was no\r\none near, and Mrs. Elliot surveyed her round flushed face anxiously in\r\nthe looking-glass.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, having removed the traces of sleep, they met each\r\nother in the hall, and Mrs. Paley observed that she was going to have\r\nher tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou like your tea too, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and invited Mrs. Elliot,\r\nwhose husband was still out, to join her at a special table which she\r\nhad placed for her under a tree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little silver goes a long way in this country,\xe2\x80\x9d she chuckled.\r\n\r\nShe sent Susan back to fetch another cup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have such excellent biscuits here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, contemplating a\r\nplateful. \xe2\x80\x9cNot sweet biscuits, which I don\xe2\x80\x99t like\xe2\x80\x94dry biscuits . . .\r\nHave you been sketching?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done two or three little daubs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Elliot, speaking\r\nrather louder than usual. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s so difficult after Oxfordshire,\r\nwhere there are so many trees. The light\xe2\x80\x99s so strong here. Some people\r\nadmire it, I know, but I find it very fatiguing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really don\xe2\x80\x99t need cooking, Susan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Paley, when her niece\r\nreturned. \xe2\x80\x9cI must trouble you to move me.\xe2\x80\x9d Everything had to be moved.\r\nFinally the old lady was placed so that the light wavered over her, as\r\nthough she were a fish in a net. Susan poured out tea, and was just\r\nremarking that they were having hot weather in Wiltshire too, when Mr.\r\nVenning asked whether he might join them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so nice to find a young man who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t despise tea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nPaley, regaining her good humour. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of my nephews the other day\r\nasked for a glass of sherry\xe2\x80\x94at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock! I told him he could get it\r\nat the public house round the corner, but not in my drawing room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather go without lunch than tea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Venning. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nstrictly true. I want both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Venning was a dark young man, about thirty-two years of age, very\r\nslapdash and confident in his manner, although at this moment obviously\r\na little excited. His friend Mr. Perrott was a barrister, and as Mr.\r\nPerrott refused to go anywhere without Mr. Venning it was necessary,\r\nwhen Mr. Perrott came to Santa Marina about a Company, for Mr. Venning\r\nto come too. He was a barrister also, but he loathed a profession which\r\nkept him indoors over books, and directly his widowed mother died he\r\nwas going, so he confided to Susan, to take up flying seriously, and\r\nbecome partner in a large business for making aeroplanes. The talk\r\nrambled on. It dealt, of course, with the beauties and singularities of\r\nthe place, the streets, the people, and the quantities of unowned\r\nyellow dogs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think it dreadfully cruel the way they treat dogs in this\r\ncountry?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Paley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d have \xe2\x80\x99em all shot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Venning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but the darling puppies,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJolly little chaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Venning. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing\r\nto eat.\xe2\x80\x9d A great wedge of cake was handed Susan on the point of a\r\ntrembling knife. Her hand trembled too as she took it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have such a dear dog at home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Elliot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy parrot can\xe2\x80\x99t stand dogs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Paley, with the air of one\r\nmaking a confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cI always suspect that he (or she) was teased by a\r\ndog when I was abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t get far this morning, Miss Warrington,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Venning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was hot,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. Their conversation became private, owing to\r\nMrs. Paley\xe2\x80\x99s deafness and the long sad history which Mrs. Elliot had\r\nembarked upon of a wire-haired terrier, white with just one black spot,\r\nbelonging to an uncle of hers, which had committed suicide. \xe2\x80\x9cAnimals do\r\ncommit suicide,\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed, as if she asserted a painful fact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we explore the town this evening?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Venning suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy aunt\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Susan began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou deserve a holiday,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re always doing things for other\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s my life,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, under cover of refilling the teapot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s no one\xe2\x80\x99s life,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, \xe2\x80\x9cno young person\xe2\x80\x99s. You\xe2\x80\x99ll come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to come,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Mrs. Elliot looked up and exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Hugh! He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbringing some one,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would like some tea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Paley. \xe2\x80\x9cSusan, run and get some\r\ncups\xe2\x80\x94there are the two young men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re thirsting for tea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Elliot. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know Mr. Ambrose,\r\nHilda? We met on the hill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe dragged me in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ridley, \xe2\x80\x9cor I should have been ashamed. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ndusty and dirty and disagreeable.\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed to his boots which were\r\nwhite with dust, while a dejected flower drooping in his buttonhole,\r\nlike an exhausted animal over a gate, added to the effect of length and\r\nuntidiness. He was introduced to the others. Mr. Hewet and Mr. Hirst\r\nbrought chairs, and tea began again, Susan pouring cascades of water\r\nfrom pot to pot, always cheerfully, and with the competence of long\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife\xe2\x80\x99s brother,\xe2\x80\x9d Ridley explained to Hilda, whom he failed to\r\nremember, \xe2\x80\x9chas a house here, which he has lent us. I was sitting on a\r\nrock thinking of nothing at all when Elliot started up like a fairy in\r\na pantomime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur chicken got into the salt,\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet said dolefully to Susan. \xe2\x80\x9cNor is\r\nit true that bananas include moisture as well as sustenance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHirst was already drinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been cursing you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ridley in answer to Mrs. Elliot\xe2\x80\x99s kind\r\nenquiries about his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cYou tourists eat up all the eggs, Helen\r\ntells me. That\xe2\x80\x99s an eye-sore too\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he nodded his head at the hotel.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDisgusting luxury, I call it. We live with pigs in the drawing-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe food is not at all what it ought to be, considering the price,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mrs. Paley seriously. \xe2\x80\x9cBut unless one goes to a hotel where is one\r\nto go to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay at home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ridley. \xe2\x80\x9cI often wish I had! Everyone ought to\r\nstay at home. But, of course, they won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Paley conceived a certain grudge against Ridley, who seemed to be\r\ncriticising her habits after an acquaintance of five minutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe in foreign travel myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she stated, \xe2\x80\x9cif one knows one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnative land, which I think I can honestly say I do. I should not allow\r\nany one to travel until they had visited Kent and Dorsetshire\xe2\x80\x94Kent for\r\nthe hops, and Dorsetshire for its old stone cottages. There is nothing\r\nto compare with them here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I always think that some people like the flat and other people\r\nlike the downs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Elliot rather vaguely.\r\n\r\nHirst, who had been eating and drinking without interruption, now lit a\r\ncigarette, and observed, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, but we\xe2\x80\x99re all agreed by this time that\r\nnature\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake. She\xe2\x80\x99s either very ugly, appallingly uncomfortable,\r\nor absolutely terrifying. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know which alarms me most\xe2\x80\x94a cow or a\r\ntree. I once met a cow in a field by night. The creature looked at me.\r\nI assure you it turned my hair grey. It\xe2\x80\x99s a disgrace that the animals\r\nshould be allowed to go at large.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did the cow think of _him_?\xe2\x80\x9d Venning mumbled to Susan, who\r\nimmediately decided in her own mind that Mr. Hirst was a dreadful young\r\nman, and that although he had such an air of being clever he probably\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t as clever as Arthur, in the ways that really matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t it Wilde who discovered the fact that nature makes no allowance\r\nfor hip-bones?\xe2\x80\x9d enquired Hughling Elliot. He knew by this time exactly\r\nwhat scholarships and distinction Hirst enjoyed, and had formed a very\r\nhigh opinion of his capacities.\r\n\r\nBut Hirst merely drew his lips together very tightly and made no reply.\r\n\r\nRidley conjectured that it was now permissible for him to take his\r\nleave. Politeness required him to thank Mrs. Elliot for his tea, and to\r\nadd, with a wave of his hand, \xe2\x80\x9cYou must come up and see us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wave included both Hirst and Hewet, and Hewet answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI should\r\nlike it immensely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe party broke up, and Susan, who had never felt so happy in her life,\r\nwas just about to start for her walk in the town with Arthur, when Mrs.\r\nPaley beckoned her back. She could not understand from the book how\r\nDouble Demon patience is played; and suggested that if they sat down\r\nand worked it out together it would fill up the time nicely before\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the promises which Mrs. Ambrose had made her niece should she\r\nstay was a room cut off from the rest of the house, large, private\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nroom in which she could play, read, think, defy the world, a fortress\r\nas well as a sanctuary. Rooms, she knew, became more like worlds than\r\nrooms at the age of twenty-four. Her judgment was correct, and when she\r\nshut the door Rachel entered an enchanted place, where the poets sang\r\nand things fell into their right proportions. Some days after the\r\nvision of the hotel by night she was sitting alone, sunk in an\r\narm-chair, reading a brightly-covered red volume lettered on the back\r\n_Works of Henrik Ibsen_. Music was open on the piano, and books of\r\nmusic rose in two jagged pillars on the floor; but for the moment music\r\nwas deserted.\r\n\r\nFar from looking bored or absent-minded, her eyes were concentrated\r\nalmost sternly upon the page, and from her breathing, which was slow\r\nbut repressed, it could be seen that her whole body was constrained by\r\nthe working of her mind. At last she shut the book sharply, lay back,\r\nand drew a deep breath, expressive of the wonder which always marks the\r\ntransition from the imaginary world to the real world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I want to know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cis this: What is the truth?\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the truth of it all?\xe2\x80\x9d She was speaking partly as herself, and\r\npartly as the heroine of the play she had just read. The landscape\r\noutside, because she had seen nothing but print for the space of two\r\nhours, now appeared amazingly solid and clear, but although there were\r\nmen on the hill washing the trunks of olive trees with a white liquid,\r\nfor the moment she herself was the most vivid thing in it\xe2\x80\x94an heroic\r\nstatue in the middle of the foreground, dominating the view. Ibsen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplays always left her in that condition. She acted them for days at a\r\ntime, greatly to Helen\xe2\x80\x99s amusement; and then it would be Meredith\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nturn and she became Diana of the Crossways. But Helen was aware that it\r\nwas not all acting, and that some sort of change was taking place in\r\nthe human being. When Rachel became tired of the rigidity of her pose\r\non the back of the chair, she turned round, slid comfortably down into\r\nit, and gazed out over the furniture through the window opposite which\r\nopened on the garden. (Her mind wandered away from Nora, but she went\r\non thinking of things that the book suggested to her, of women and\r\nlife.)\r\n\r\nDuring the three months she had been here she had made up considerably,\r\nas Helen meant she should, for time spent in interminable walks round\r\nsheltered gardens, and the household gossip of her aunts. But Mrs.\r\nAmbrose would have been the first to disclaim any influence, or indeed\r\nany belief that to influence was within her power. She saw her less\r\nshy, and less serious, which was all to the good, and the violent leaps\r\nand the interminable mazes which had led to that result were usually\r\nnot even guessed at by her. Talk was the medicine she trusted to, talk\r\nabout everything, talk that was free, unguarded, and as candid as a\r\nhabit of talking with men made natural in her own case. Nor did she\r\nencourage those habits of unselfishness and amiability founded upon\r\ninsincerity which are put at so high a value in mixed households of men\r\nand women. She desired that Rachel should think, and for this reason\r\noffered books and discouraged too entire a dependence upon Bach and\r\nBeethoven and Wagner. But when Mrs. Ambrose would have suggested Defoe,\r\nMaupassant, or some spacious chronicle of family life, Rachel chose\r\nmodern books, books in shiny yellow covers, books with a great deal of\r\ngilding on the back, which were tokens in her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s eyes of harsh\r\nwrangling and disputes about facts which had no such importance as the\r\nmoderns claimed for them. But she did not interfere. Rachel read what\r\nshe chose, reading with the curious literalness of one to whom written\r\nsentences are unfamiliar, and handling words as though they were made\r\nof wood, separately of great importance, and possessed of shapes like\r\ntables or chairs. In this way she came to conclusions, which had to be\r\nremodelled according to the adventures of the day, and were indeed\r\nrecast as liberally as any one could desire, leaving always a small\r\ngrain of belief behind them.\r\n\r\nIbsen was succeeded by a novel such as Mrs. Ambrose detested, whose\r\npurpose was to distribute the guilt of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s downfall upon the\r\nright shoulders; a purpose which was achieved, if the reader\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndiscomfort were any proof of it. She threw the book down, looked out of\r\nthe window, turned away from the window, and relapsed into an\r\narm-chair.\r\n\r\nThe morning was hot, and the exercise of reading left her mind\r\ncontracting and expanding like the main-spring of a clock, and the\r\nsmall noises of midday, which one can ascribe to no definite cause, in\r\na regular rhythm. It was all very real, very big, very impersonal, and\r\nafter a moment or two she began to raise her first finger and to let it\r\nfall on the arm of her chair so as to bring back to herself some\r\nconsciousness of her own existence. She was next overcome by the\r\nunspeakable queerness of the fact that she should be sitting in an\r\narm-chair, in the morning, in the middle of the world. Who were the\r\npeople moving in the house\xe2\x80\x94moving things from one place to another? And\r\nlife, what was that? It was only a light passing over the surface and\r\nvanishing, as in time she would vanish, though the furniture in the\r\nroom would remain. Her dissolution became so complete that she could\r\nnot raise her finger any more, and sat perfectly still, listening and\r\nlooking always at the same spot. It became stranger and stranger. She\r\nwas overcome with awe that things should exist at all. . . . She forgot\r\nthat she had any fingers to raise. . . . The things that existed were\r\nso immense and so desolate. . . . She continued to be conscious of\r\nthese vast masses of substance for a long stretch of time, the clock\r\nstill ticking in the midst of the universal silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d she said mechanically, for a string in her brain seemed to\r\nbe pulled by a persistent knocking at the door. With great slowness the\r\ndoor opened and a tall human being came towards her, holding out her\r\narm and saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to say to this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe utter absurdity of a woman coming into a room with a piece of paper\r\nin her hand amazed Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to answer, or who Terence Hewet is,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen\r\ncontinued, in the toneless voice of a ghost. She put a paper before\r\nRachel on which were written the incredible words:\r\n\r\nDEAR MRS. AMBROSE\xe2\x80\x94I am getting up a picnic for next Friday, when we\r\npropose to start at eleven-thirty if the weather is fine, and to make\r\nthe ascent of Monte Rosa. It will take some time, but the view should\r\nbe magnificent. It would give me great pleasure if you and Miss Vinrace\r\nwould consent to be of the party.\xe2\x80\x94Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nTERENCE HEWET\r\n\r\n\r\nRachel read the words aloud to make herself believe in them. For the\r\nsame reason she put her hand on Helen\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBooks\xe2\x80\x94books\xe2\x80\x94books,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen, in her absent-minded way. \xe2\x80\x9cMore new\r\nbooks\xe2\x80\x94I wonder what you find in them. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the second time Rachel read the letter, but to herself. This time,\r\ninstead of seeming vague as ghosts, each word was astonishingly\r\nprominent; they came out as the tops of mountains come through a mist.\r\n_Friday_\xe2\x80\x94_eleven-thirty_\xe2\x80\x94_Miss Vinrace_. The blood began to run in her\r\nveins; she felt her eyes brighten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must go,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, rather surprising Helen by her decision. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nmust certainly go\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94such was the relief of finding that things still\r\nhappened, and indeed they appeared the brighter for the mist\r\nsurrounding them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonte Rosa\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the mountain over there, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nHewet\xe2\x80\x94who\xe2\x80\x99s he? One of the young men Ridley met, I suppose. Shall I say\r\nyes, then? It may be dreadfully dull.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took the letter back and went, for the messenger was waiting for\r\nher answer.\r\n\r\nThe party which had been suggested a few nights ago in Mr. Hirst\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbedroom had taken shape and was the source of great satisfaction to Mr.\r\nHewet, who had seldom used his practical abilities, and was pleased to\r\nfind them equal to the strain. His invitations had been universally\r\naccepted, which was the more encouraging as they had been issued\r\nagainst Hirst\xe2\x80\x99s advice to people who were very dull, not at all suited\r\nto each other, and sure not to come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he twirled and untwirled a note signed Helen\r\nAmbrose, \xe2\x80\x9cthe gifts needed to make a great commander have been absurdly\r\noverrated. About half the intellectual effort which is needed to review\r\na book of modern poetry has enabled me to get together seven or eight\r\npeople, of opposite sexes, at the same spot at the same hour on the\r\nsame day. What else is generalship, Hirst? What more did Wellington do\r\non the field of Waterloo? It\xe2\x80\x99s like counting the number of pebbles of a\r\npath, tedious but not difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was sitting in his bedroom, one leg over the arm of the chair, and\r\nHirst was writing a letter opposite. Hirst was quick to point out that\r\nall the difficulties remained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor instance, here are two women you\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen. Suppose one of\r\nthem suffers from mountain-sickness, as my sister does, and the other\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the women are for you,\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cI asked them solely\r\nfor your benefit. What you want, Hirst, you know, is the society of\r\nyoung women of your own age. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to get on with women,\r\nwhich is a great defect, considering that half the world consists of\r\nwomen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHirst groaned that he was quite aware of that.\r\n\r\nBut Hewet\xe2\x80\x99s complacency was a little chilled as he walked with Hirst to\r\nthe place where a general meeting had been appointed. He wondered why\r\non earth he had asked these people, and what one really expected to get\r\nfrom bunching human beings up together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCows,\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected, \xe2\x80\x9cdraw together in a field; ships in a calm; and\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re just the same when we\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing else to do. But why do we do\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x94is it to prevent ourselves from seeing to the bottom of things\xe2\x80\x9d (he\r\nstopped by a stream and began stirring it with his walking-stick and\r\nclouding the water with mud), \xe2\x80\x9cmaking cities and mountains and whole\r\nuniverses out of nothing, or do we really love each other, or do we, on\r\nthe other hand, live in a state of perpetual uncertainty, knowing\r\nnothing, leaping from moment to moment as from world to world?\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nis, on the whole, the view _I_ incline to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe jumped over the stream; Hirst went round and joined him, remarking\r\nthat he had long ceased to look for the reason of any human action.\r\n\r\nHalf a mile further, they came to a group of plane trees and the\r\nsalmon-pink farmhouse standing by the stream which had been chosen as\r\nmeeting-place. It was a shady spot, lying conveniently just where the\r\nhill sprung out from the flat. Between the thin stems of the plane\r\ntrees the young men could see little knots of donkeys pasturing, and a\r\ntall woman rubbing the nose of one of them, while another woman was\r\nkneeling by the stream lapping water out of her palms.\r\n\r\nAs they entered the shady place, Helen looked up and then held out her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must introduce myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am Mrs. Ambrose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving shaken hands, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my niece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel approached awkwardly. She held out her hand, but withdrew it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all wet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nScarcely had they spoken, when the first carriage drew up.\r\n\r\nThe donkeys were quickly jerked into attention, and the second carriage\r\narrived. By degrees the grove filled with people\xe2\x80\x94the Elliots, the\r\nThornburys, Mr. Venning and Susan, Miss Allan, Evelyn Murgatroyd, and\r\nMr. Perrott. Mr. Hirst acted the part of hoarse energetic sheep-dog. By\r\nmeans of a few words of caustic Latin he had the animals marshalled,\r\nand by inclining a sharp shoulder he lifted the ladies. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Hewet\r\nfails to understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cis that we must break the back of\r\nthe ascent before midday.\xe2\x80\x9d He was assisting a young lady, by name\r\nEvelyn Murgatroyd, as he spoke. She rose light as a bubble to her seat.\r\nWith a feather drooping from a broad-brimmed hat, in white from top to\r\ntoe, she looked like a gallant lady of the time of Charles the First\r\nleading royalist troops into action.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRide with me,\xe2\x80\x9d she commanded; and, as soon as Hirst had swung himself\r\nacross a mule, the two started, leading the cavalcade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not to call me Miss Murgatroyd. I hate it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nname\xe2\x80\x99s Evelyn. What\xe2\x80\x99s yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSt. John,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Evelyn. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s your friend\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis initials being R. S. T., we call him Monk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99re all too clever,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich way? Pick me a branch.\r\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s canter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave her donkey a sharp cut with a switch and started forward. The\r\nfull and romantic career of Evelyn Murgatroyd is best hit off by her\r\nown words, \xe2\x80\x9cCall me Evelyn and I\xe2\x80\x99ll call you St. John.\xe2\x80\x9d She said that\r\non very slight provocation\xe2\x80\x94her surname was enough\xe2\x80\x94but although a great\r\nmany young men had answered her already with considerable spirit she\r\nwent on saying it and making choice of none. But her donkey stumbled to\r\na jog-trot, and she had to ride in advance alone, for the path when it\r\nbegan to ascend one of the spines of the hill became narrow and\r\nscattered with stones. The cavalcade wound on like a jointed\r\ncaterpillar, tufted with the white parasols of the ladies, and the\r\npanama hats of the gentlemen. At one point where the ground rose\r\nsharply, Evelyn M. jumped off, threw her reins to the native boy, and\r\nadjured St. John Hirst to dismount too. Their example was followed by\r\nthose who felt the need of stretching.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see any need to get off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Allan to Mrs. Elliot just\r\nbehind her, \xe2\x80\x9cconsidering the difficulty I had getting on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese little donkeys stand anything, _n\xe2\x80\x99est-ce pas_?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Elliot\r\naddressed the guide, who obligingly bowed his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlowers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen, stooping to pick the lovely little bright\r\nflowers which grew separately here and there. \xe2\x80\x9cYou pinch their leaves\r\nand then they smell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, laying one on Miss Allan\xe2\x80\x99s knee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t we met before?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Allan, looking at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was taking it for granted,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen laughed, for in the confusion of\r\nmeeting they had not been introduced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow sensible!\xe2\x80\x9d chirped Mrs. Elliot. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just what one would always\r\nlike\xe2\x80\x94only unfortunately it\xe2\x80\x99s not possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot possible?\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything\xe2\x80\x99s possible. Who knows what\r\nmayn\xe2\x80\x99t happen before night-fall?\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, mocking the poor\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s timidity, who depended so implicitly upon one thing following\r\nanother that the mere glimpse of a world where dinner could be\r\ndisregarded, or the table moved one inch from its accustomed place,\r\nfilled her with fears for her own stability.\r\n\r\nHigher and higher they went, becoming separated from the world. The\r\nworld, when they turned to look back, flattened itself out, and was\r\nmarked with squares of thin green and grey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTowns are very small,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel remarked, obscuring the whole of Santa\r\nMarina and its suburbs with one hand. The sea filled in all the angles\r\nof the coast smoothly, breaking in a white frill, and here and there\r\nships were set firmly in the blue. The sea was stained with purple and\r\ngreen blots, and there was a glittering line upon the rim where it met\r\nthe sky. The air was very clear and silent save for the sharp noise of\r\ngrasshoppers and the hum of bees, which sounded loud in the ear as they\r\nshot past and vanished. The party halted and sat for a time in a quarry\r\non the hillside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmazingly clear,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed St. John, identifying one cleft in the\r\nland after another.\r\n\r\nEvelyn M. sat beside him, propping her chin on her hand. She surveyed\r\nthe view with a certain look of triumph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you think Garibaldi was ever up here?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked Mr. Hirst. Oh, if\r\nshe had been his bride! If, instead of a picnic party, this was a party\r\nof patriots, and she, red-shirted like the rest, had lain among grim\r\nmen, flat on the turf, aiming her gun at the white turrets beneath\r\nthem, screening her eyes to pierce through the smoke! So thinking, her\r\nfoot stirred restlessly, and she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t call this _life_, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you call life?\xe2\x80\x9d said St. John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFighting\xe2\x80\x94revolution,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, still gazing at the doomed city. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nonly care for books, I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re quite wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExplain,\xe2\x80\x9d she urged, for there were no guns to be aimed at bodies, and\r\nshe turned to another kind of warfare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I care for? People,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I _am_ surprised!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou look so awfully serious.\r\nDo let\xe2\x80\x99s be friends and tell each other what we\xe2\x80\x99re like. I hate being\r\ncautious, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut St. John was decidedly cautious, as she could see by the sudden\r\nconstriction of his lips, and had no intention of revealing his soul to\r\na young lady. \xe2\x80\x9cThe ass is eating my hat,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, and stretched\r\nout for it instead of answering her. Evelyn blushed very slightly and\r\nthen turned with some impetuosity upon Mr. Perrott, and when they\r\nmounted again it was Mr. Perrott who lifted her to her seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen one has laid the eggs one eats the omelette,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hughling\r\nElliot, exquisitely in French, a hint to the rest of them that it was\r\ntime to ride on again.\r\n\r\nThe midday sun which Hirst had foretold was beginning to beat down\r\nhotly. The higher they got the more of the sky appeared, until the\r\nmountain was only a small tent of earth against an enormous blue\r\nbackground. The English fell silent; the natives who walked beside the\r\ndonkeys broke into queer wavering songs and tossed jokes from one to\r\nthe other. The way grew very steep, and each rider kept his eyes fixed\r\non the hobbling curved form of the rider and donkey directly in front\r\nof him. Rather more strain was being put upon their bodies than is\r\nquite legitimate in a party of pleasure, and Hewet overheard one or two\r\nslightly grumbling remarks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExpeditions in such heat are perhaps a little unwise,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Elliot\r\nmurmured to Miss Allan.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Allan returned, \xe2\x80\x9cI always like to get to the top\xe2\x80\x9d; and it was\r\ntrue, although she was a big woman, stiff in the joints, and unused to\r\ndonkey-riding, but as her holidays were few she made the most of them.\r\n\r\nThe vivacious white figure rode well in front; she had somehow\r\npossessed herself of a leafy branch and wore it round her hat like a\r\ngarland. They went on for a few minutes in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe view will be wonderful,\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet assured them, turning round in his\r\nsaddle and smiling encouragement. Rachel caught his eye and smiled too.\r\nThey struggled on for some time longer, nothing being heard but the\r\nclatter of hooves striving on the loose stones. Then they saw that\r\nEvelyn was off her ass, and that Mr. Perrott was standing in the\r\nattitude of a statesman in Parliament Square, stretching an arm of\r\nstone towards the view. A little to the left of them was a low ruined\r\nwall, the stump of an Elizabethan watch-tower.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have stood it much longer,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Elliot confided to Mrs.\r\nThornbury, but the excitement of being at the top in another moment and\r\nseeing the view prevented any one from answering her. One after another\r\nthey came out on the flat space at the top and stood overcome with\r\nwonder. Before them they beheld an immense space\xe2\x80\x94grey sands running\r\ninto forest, and forest merging in mountains, and mountains washed by\r\nair, the infinite distances of South America. A river ran across the\r\nplain, as flat as the land, and appearing quite as stationary. The\r\neffect of so much space was at first rather chilling. They felt\r\nthemselves very small, and for some time no one said anything. Then\r\nEvelyn exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cSplendid!\xe2\x80\x9d She took hold of the hand that was next\r\nher; it chanced to be Miss Allan\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNorth\xe2\x80\x94South\xe2\x80\x94East\xe2\x80\x94West,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Allan, jerking her head slightly\r\ntowards the points of the compass.\r\n\r\nHewet, who had gone a little in front, looked up at his guests as if to\r\njustify himself for having brought them. He observed how strangely the\r\npeople standing in a row with their figures bent slightly forward and\r\ntheir clothes plastered by the wind to the shape of their bodies\r\nresembled naked statues. On their pedestal of earth they looked\r\nunfamiliar and noble, but in another moment they had broken their rank,\r\nand he had to see to the laying out of food. Hirst came to his help,\r\nand they handed packets of chicken and bread from one to another.\r\n\r\nAs St. John gave Helen her packet she looked him full in the face and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember\xe2\x80\x94two women?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99re the two women!\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet exclaimed, looking from Helen to\r\nRachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour lights tempted us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen. \xe2\x80\x9cWe watched you playing cards,\r\nbut we never knew that we were being watched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was like a thing in a play,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Hirst couldn\xe2\x80\x99t describe you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly odd to have seen Helen and to find nothing to say\r\nabout her.\r\n\r\nHughling Elliot put up his eyeglass and grasped the situation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know of anything more dreadful,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pulling at the joint\r\nof a chicken\xe2\x80\x99s leg, \xe2\x80\x9cthan being seen when one isn\xe2\x80\x99t conscious of it.\r\nOne feels sure one has been caught doing something ridiculous\xe2\x80\x94looking\r\nat one\xe2\x80\x99s tongue in a hansom, for instance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow the others ceased to look at the view, and drawing together sat\r\ndown in a circle round the baskets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet those little looking-glasses in hansoms have a fascination of\r\ntheir own,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Thornbury. \xe2\x80\x9cOne\xe2\x80\x99s features look so different when\r\none can only see a bit of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere will soon be very few hansom cabs left,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Elliot. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nfour-wheeled cabs\xe2\x80\x94I assure you even at Oxford it\xe2\x80\x99s almost impossible to\r\nget a four-wheeled cab.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what happens to the horses,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVeal pie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s high time that horses should become extinct anyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re distressingly ugly, besides being vicious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Susan, who had been brought up to understand that the horse is the\r\nnoblest of God\xe2\x80\x99s creatures, could not agree, and Venning thought Hirst\r\nan unspeakable ass, but was too polite not to continue the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen they see us falling out of aeroplanes they get some of their own\r\nback, I expect,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou fly?\xe2\x80\x9d said old Mr. Thornbury, putting on his spectacles to look at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope to, some day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur.\r\n\r\nHere flying was discussed at length, and Mrs. Thornbury delivered an\r\nopinion which was almost a speech to the effect that it would be quite\r\nnecessary in time of war, and in England we were terribly behind-hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were a young fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d she concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cI should certainly\r\nqualify.\xe2\x80\x9d It was odd to look at the little elderly lady, in her grey\r\ncoat and skirt, with a sandwich in her hand, her eyes lighting up with\r\nzeal as she imagined herself a young man in an aeroplane. For some\r\nreason, however, the talk did not run easily after this, and all they\r\nsaid was about drink and salt and the view. Suddenly Miss Allan, who\r\nwas seated with her back to the ruined wall, put down her sandwich,\r\npicked something off her neck, and remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m covered with little\r\ncreatures.\xe2\x80\x9d It was true, and the discovery was very welcome. The ants\r\nwere pouring down a glacier of loose earth heaped between the stones of\r\nthe ruin\xe2\x80\x94large brown ants with polished bodies. She held out one on the\r\nback of her hand for Helen to look at.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose they sting?\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will not sting, but they may infest the victuals,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nAllan, and measures were taken at once to divert the ants from their\r\ncourse. At Hewet\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion it was decided to adopt the methods of\r\nmodern warfare against an invading army. The table-cloth represented\r\nthe invaded country, and round it they built barricades of baskets, set\r\nup the wine bottles in a rampart, made fortifications of bread and dug\r\nfosses of salt. When an ant got through it was exposed to a fire of\r\nbread-crumbs, until Susan pronounced that that was cruel, and rewarded\r\nthose brave spirits with spoil in the shape of tongue. Playing this\r\ngame they lost their stiffness, and even became unusually daring, for\r\nMr. Perrott, who was very shy, said, \xe2\x80\x9cPermit me,\xe2\x80\x9d and removed an ant\r\nfrom Evelyn\xe2\x80\x99s neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be no laughing matter really,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Elliot\r\nconfidentially to Mrs. Thornbury, \xe2\x80\x9cif an ant did get between the vest\r\nand the skin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe noise grew suddenly more clamorous, for it was discovered that a\r\nlong line of ants had found their way on to the table-cloth by a back\r\nentrance, and if success could be gauged by noise, Hewet had every\r\nreason to think his party a success. Nevertheless he became, for no\r\nreason at all, profoundly depressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are not satisfactory; they are ignoble,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, surveying\r\nhis guests from a little distance, where he was gathering together the\r\nplates. He glanced at them all, stooping and swaying and gesticulating\r\nround the table-cloth. Amiable and modest, respectable in many ways,\r\nlovable even in their contentment and desire to be kind, how mediocre\r\nthey all were, and capable of what insipid cruelty to one another!\r\nThere was Mrs. Thornbury, sweet but trivial in her maternal egoism;\r\nMrs. Elliot, perpetually complaining of her lot; her husband a mere pea\r\nin a pod; and Susan\xe2\x80\x94she had no self, and counted neither one way nor\r\nthe other; Venning was as honest and as brutal as a schoolboy; poor old\r\nThornbury merely trod his round like a horse in a mill; and the less\r\none examined into Evelyn\xe2\x80\x99s character the better, he suspected. Yet\r\nthese were the people with money, and to them rather than to others was\r\ngiven the management of the world. Put among them some one more vital,\r\nwho cared for life or for beauty, and what an agony, what a waste would\r\nthey inflict on him if he tried to share with them and not to scourge!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Hirst,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, coming to the figure of his friend; with\r\nhis usual little frown of concentration upon his forehead he was\r\npeeling the skin off a banana. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he\xe2\x80\x99s as ugly as sin.\xe2\x80\x9d For the\r\nugliness of St. John Hirst, and the limitations that went with it, he\r\nmade the rest in some way responsible. It was their fault that he had\r\nto live alone. Then he came to Helen, attracted to her by the sound of\r\nher laugh. She was laughing at Miss Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wear combinations in\r\nthis heat?\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a voice which was meant to be private. He liked\r\nthe look of her immensely, not so much her beauty, but her largeness\r\nand simplicity, which made her stand out from the rest like a great\r\nstone woman, and he passed on in a gentler mood. His eye fell upon\r\nRachel. She was lying back rather behind the others resting on one\r\nelbow; she might have been thinking precisely the same thoughts as\r\nHewet himself. Her eyes were fixed rather sadly but not intently upon\r\nthe row of people opposite her. Hewet crawled up to her on his knees,\r\nwith a piece of bread in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you looking at?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nShe was a little startled, but answered directly, \xe2\x80\x9cHuman beings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nOne after another they rose and stretched themselves, and in a few\r\nminutes divided more or less into two separate parties. One of these\r\nparties was dominated by Hughling Elliot and Mrs. Thornbury, who,\r\nhaving both read the same books and considered the same questions, were\r\nnow anxious to name the places beneath them and to hang upon them\r\nstores of information about navies and armies, political parties,\r\nnatives and mineral products\xe2\x80\x94all of which combined, they said, to prove\r\nthat South America was the country of the future.\r\n\r\nEvelyn M. listened with her bright blue eyes fixed upon the oracles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow it makes one long to be a man!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nMr. Perrott answered, surveying the plain, that a country with a future\r\nwas a very fine thing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Evelyn, turning to him and drawing her glove\r\nvehemently through her fingers, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d raise a troop and conquer some\r\ngreat territory and make it splendid. You\xe2\x80\x99d want women for that. I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nlove to start life from the very beginning as it ought to be\xe2\x80\x94nothing\r\nsqualid\xe2\x80\x94but great halls and gardens and splendid men and women. But\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94you only like Law Courts!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd would you really be content without pretty frocks and sweets and\r\nall the things young ladies like?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Perrott, concealing a\r\ncertain amount of pain beneath his ironical manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a young lady,\xe2\x80\x9d Evelyn flashed; she bit her underlip. \xe2\x80\x9cJust\r\nbecause I like splendid things you laugh at me. Why are there no men\r\nlike Garibaldi now?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Perrott, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t give me a chance. You think\r\nwe ought to begin things fresh. Good. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t see precisely\xe2\x80\x94conquer\r\na territory? They\xe2\x80\x99re all conquered already, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not any territory in particular,\xe2\x80\x9d Evelyn explained. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nidea, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? We lead such tame lives. And I feel sure you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot splendid things in you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHewet saw the scars and hollows in Mr. Perrott\xe2\x80\x99s sagacious face relax\r\npathetically. He could imagine the calculations which even then went on\r\nwithin his mind, as to whether he would be justified in asking a woman\r\nto marry him, considering that he made no more than five hundred a year\r\nat the Bar, owned no private means, and had an invalid sister to\r\nsupport. Mr. Perrott again knew that he was not \xe2\x80\x9cquite,\xe2\x80\x9d as Susan\r\nstated in her diary; not quite a gentleman she meant, for he was the\r\nson of a grocer in Leeds, had started life with a basket on his back,\r\nand now, though practically indistinguishable from a born gentleman,\r\nshowed his origin to keen eyes in an impeccable neatness of dress, lack\r\nof freedom in manner, extreme cleanliness of person, and a certain\r\nindescribable timidity and precision with his knife and fork which\r\nmight be the relic of days when meat was rare, and the way of handling\r\nit by no means gingerly.\r\n\r\nThe two parties who were strolling about and losing their unity now\r\ncame together, and joined each other in a long stare over the yellow\r\nand green patches of the heated landscape below. The hot air danced\r\nacross it, making it impossible to see the roofs of a village on the\r\nplain distinctly. Even on the top of the mountain where a breeze played\r\nlightly, it was very hot, and the heat, the food, the immense space,\r\nand perhaps some less well-defined cause produced a comfortable\r\ndrowsiness and a sense of happy relaxation in them. They did not say\r\nmuch, but felt no constraint in being silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose we go and see what\xe2\x80\x99s to be seen over there?\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur to\r\nSusan, and the pair walked off together, their departure certainly\r\nsending some thrill of emotion through the rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn odd lot, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought we should never get\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em all to the top. But I\xe2\x80\x99m glad we came, by Jove! I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nmissed this for something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t _like_ Mr. Hirst,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan inconsequently. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvery clever, but why should clever people be so\xe2\x80\x94I expect he\xe2\x80\x99s awfully\r\nnice, really,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, instinctively qualifying what might have\r\nseemed an unkind remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHirst? Oh, he\xe2\x80\x99s one of these learned chaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur\r\nindifferently. \xe2\x80\x9cHe don\xe2\x80\x99t look as if he enjoyed it. You should hear him\r\ntalking to Elliot. It\xe2\x80\x99s as much as I can do to follow \xe2\x80\x99em at all. . . .\r\nI was never good at my books.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these sentences and the pauses that came between them they reached\r\na little hillock, on the top of which grew several slim trees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you mind if we sit down here?\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, looking about him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njolly in the shade\xe2\x80\x94and the view\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d They sat down, and looked straight\r\nahead of them in silence for some time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I do envy those clever chaps sometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsuppose they ever . . .\xe2\x80\x9d He did not finish his sentence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t see why you should envy them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, with great\r\nsincerity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOdd things happen to one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur. \xe2\x80\x9cOne goes along smoothly\r\nenough, one thing following another, and it\xe2\x80\x99s all very jolly and plain\r\nsailing, and you think you know all about it, and suddenly one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow where one is a bit, and everything seems different from what it\r\nused to seem. Now to-day, coming up that path, riding behind you, I\r\nseemed to see everything as if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he paused and plucked a piece of grass\r\nup by the roots. He scattered the little lumps of earth which were\r\nsticking to the roots\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAs if it had a kind of meaning. You\xe2\x80\x99ve made the\r\ndifference to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he jerked out, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nyou. I\xe2\x80\x99ve felt it ever since I knew you. . . . It\xe2\x80\x99s because I love\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven while they had been saying commonplace things Susan had been\r\nconscious of the excitement of intimacy, which seemed not only to lay\r\nbare something in her, but in the trees and the sky, and the progress\r\nof his speech which seemed inevitable was positively painful to her,\r\nfor no human being had ever come so close to her before.\r\n\r\nShe was struck motionless as his speech went on, and her heart gave\r\ngreat separate leaps at the last words. She sat with her fingers curled\r\nround a stone, looking straight in front of her down the mountain over\r\nthe plain. So then, it had actually happened to her, a proposal of\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nArthur looked round at her; his face was oddly twisted. She was drawing\r\nher breath with such difficulty that she could hardly answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might have known.\xe2\x80\x9d He seized her in his arms; again and again and\r\nagain they clasped each other, murmuring inarticulately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Arthur, sinking back on the ground, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the most\r\nwonderful thing that\xe2\x80\x99s ever happened to me.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked as if he were\r\ntrying to put things seen in a dream beside real things.\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the most perfect thing in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d Susan stated, very gently\r\nand with great conviction. It was no longer merely a proposal of\r\nmarriage, but of marriage with Arthur, with whom she was in love.\r\n\r\nIn the silence that followed, holding his hand tightly in hers, she\r\nprayed to God that she might make him a good wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what will Mr. Perrott say?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked at the end of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear old fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur who, now that the first shock was over,\r\nwas relaxing into an enormous sense of pleasure and contentment. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nmust be very nice to him, Susan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe told her how hard Perrott\xe2\x80\x99s life had been, and how absurdly devoted\r\nhe was to Arthur himself. He went on to tell her about his mother, a\r\nwidow lady, of strong character. In return Susan sketched the portraits\r\nof her own family\xe2\x80\x94Edith in particular, her youngest sister, whom she\r\nloved better than any one else, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept you, Arthur. . . . Arthur,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat was it that you first liked me for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a buckle you wore one night at sea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, after due\r\nconsideration. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember noticing\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s an absurd thing to\r\nnotice!\xe2\x80\x94that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t take peas, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom this they went on to compare their more serious tastes, or rather\r\nSusan ascertained what Arthur cared about, and professed herself very\r\nfond of the same thing. They would live in London, perhaps have a\r\ncottage in the country near Susan\xe2\x80\x99s family, for they would find it\r\nstrange without her at first. Her mind, stunned to begin with, now flew\r\nto the various changes that her engagement would make\xe2\x80\x94how delightful it\r\nwould be to join the ranks of the married women\xe2\x80\x94no longer to hang on to\r\ngroups of girls much younger than herself\xe2\x80\x94to escape the long solitude\r\nof an old maid\xe2\x80\x99s life. Now and then her amazing good fortune overcame\r\nher, and she turned to Arthur with an exclamation of love.\r\n\r\nThey lay in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms and had no notion that they were\r\nobserved. Yet two figures suddenly appeared among the trees above them.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s shade,\xe2\x80\x9d began Hewet, when Rachel suddenly stopped dead. They\r\nsaw a man and woman lying on the ground beneath them, rolling slightly\r\nthis way and that as the embrace tightened and slackened. The man then\r\nsat upright and the woman, who now appeared to be Susan Warrington, lay\r\nback upon the ground, with her eyes shut and an absorbed look upon her\r\nface, as though she were not altogether conscious. Nor could you tell\r\nfrom her expression whether she was happy, or had suffered something.\r\nWhen Arthur again turned to her, butting her as a lamb butts a ewe,\r\nHewet and Rachel retreated without a word. Hewet felt uncomfortably\r\nshy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel after a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can remember not liking it either,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet. \xe2\x80\x9cI can remember\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbut he changed his mind and continued in an ordinary tone of voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we may take it for granted that they\xe2\x80\x99re engaged. D\xe2\x80\x99you think\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll ever fly, or will she put a stop to that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Rachel was still agitated; she could not get away from the sight\r\nthey had just seen. Instead of answering Hewet she persisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove\xe2\x80\x99s an odd thing, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, making one\xe2\x80\x99s heart beat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so enormously important, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet replied. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir lives\r\nare now changed for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it makes one sorry for them too,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel continued, as though she\r\nwere tracing the course of her feelings. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know either of them,\r\nbut I could almost burst into tears. That\xe2\x80\x99s silly, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust because they\xe2\x80\x99re in love,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he added after a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s consideration, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s something horribly pathetic about it,\r\nI agree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd now, as they had walked some way from the grove of trees, and had\r\ncome to a rounded hollow very tempting to the back, they proceeded to\r\nsit down, and the impression of the lovers lost some of its force,\r\nthough a certain intensity of vision, which was probably the result of\r\nthe sight, remained with them. As a day upon which any emotion has been\r\nrepressed is different from other days, so this day was now different,\r\nmerely because they had seen other people at a crisis of their lives.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great encampment of tents they might be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet, looking in\r\nfront of him at the mountains. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it like a water-colour too\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nknow the way water-colours dry in ridges all across the paper\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nwondering what they looked like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis eyes became dreamy, as though he were matching things, and reminded\r\nRachel in their colour of the green flesh of a snail. She sat beside\r\nhim looking at the mountains too. When it became painful to look any\r\nlonger, the great size of the view seeming to enlarge her eyes beyond\r\ntheir natural limit, she looked at the ground; it pleased her to\r\nscrutinise this inch of the soil of South America so minutely that she\r\nnoticed every grain of earth and made it into a world where she was\r\nendowed with the supreme power. She bent a blade of grass, and set an\r\ninsect on the utmost tassel of it, and wondered if the insect realised\r\nhis strange adventure, and thought how strange it was that she should\r\nhave bent that tassel rather than any other of the million tassels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve never told me your name,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Somebody\r\nVinrace. . . . I like to know people\xe2\x80\x99s Christian names.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRachel,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRachel,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI have an aunt called Rachel, who put the life\r\nof Father Damien into verse. She is a religious fanatic\xe2\x80\x94the result of\r\nthe way she was brought up, down in Northamptonshire, never seeing a\r\nsoul. Have you any aunts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI live with them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I wonder what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing now?\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are probably buying wool,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel determined. She tried to\r\ndescribe them. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are small, rather pale women,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, \xe2\x80\x9cvery\r\nclean. We live in Richmond. They have an old dog, too, who will only\r\neat the marrow out of bones. . . . They are always going to church.\r\nThey tidy their drawers a good deal.\xe2\x80\x9d But here she was overcome by the\r\ndifficulty of describing people.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s all going on still!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe sun was behind them and two long shadows suddenly lay upon the\r\nground in front of them, one waving because it was made by a skirt, and\r\nthe other stationary, because thrown by a pair of legs in trousers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look very comfortable!\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen\xe2\x80\x99s voice above them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHirst,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet, pointing at the scissorlike shadow; he then rolled\r\nround to look up at them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s room for us all here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nWhen Hirst had seated himself comfortably, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you congratulate the young couple?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt appeared that, coming to the same spot a few minutes after Hewet and\r\nRachel, Helen and Hirst had seen precisely the same thing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t congratulate them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet. \xe2\x80\x9cThey seemed very\r\nhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst, pursing up his lips, \xe2\x80\x9cso long as I needn\xe2\x80\x99t marry\r\neither of them\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were very much moved,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you would be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich was it, Monk? The thought\r\nof the immortal passions, or the thought of new-born males to keep the\r\nRoman Catholics out? I assure you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Helen, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s capable of\r\nbeing moved by either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel was a good deal stung by his banter, which she felt to be\r\ndirected equally against them both, but she could think of no repartee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing moves Hirst,\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet laughed; he did not seem to be stung at\r\nall. \xe2\x80\x9cUnless it were a transfinite number falling in love with a finite\r\none\xe2\x80\x94I suppose such things do happen, even in mathematics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst with a touch of annoyance, \xe2\x80\x9cI consider\r\nmyself a person of very strong passions.\xe2\x80\x9d It was clear from the way he\r\nspoke that he meant it seriously; he spoke of course for the benefit of\r\nthe ladies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, Hirst,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet, after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cI have a terrible\r\nconfession to make. Your book\xe2\x80\x94the poems of Wordsworth, which if you\r\nremember I took off your table just as we were starting, and certainly\r\nput in my pocket here\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs lost,\xe2\x80\x9d Hirst finished for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI consider that there is still a chance,\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet urged, slapping\r\nhimself to right and left, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I never did take it after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is here.\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed to his breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God,\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI need no longer feel as though I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nmurdered a child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think you were always losing things,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen remarked, looking\r\nat him meditatively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t lose things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet. \xe2\x80\x9cI mislay them. That was the reason\r\nwhy Hirst refused to share a cabin with me on the voyage out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou came out together?\xe2\x80\x9d Helen enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI propose that each member of this party now gives a short\r\nbiographical sketch of himself or herself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst, sitting\r\nupright. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vinrace, you come first; begin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel stated that she was twenty-four years of age, the daughter of a\r\nship-owner, that she had never been properly educated; played the\r\npiano, had no brothers or sisters, and lived at Richmond with aunts,\r\nher mother being dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst, having taken in these facts; he pointed at Hewet.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the son of an English gentleman. I am twenty-seven,\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet began.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father was a fox-hunting squire. He died when I was ten in the\r\nhunting field. I can remember his body coming home, on a shutter I\r\nsuppose, just as I was going down to tea, and noticing that there was\r\njam for tea, and wondering whether I should be allowed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but keep to the facts,\xe2\x80\x9d Hirst put in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was educated at Winchester and Cambridge, which I had to leave after\r\na time. I have done a good many things since\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProfession?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone\xe2\x80\x94at least\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTastes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiterary. I\xe2\x80\x99m writing a novel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrothers and sisters?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree sisters, no brother, and a mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all we\xe2\x80\x99re to hear about you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen. She stated that she\r\nwas very old\xe2\x80\x94forty last October, and her father had been a solicitor in\r\nthe city who had gone bankrupt, for which reason she had never had much\r\neducation\xe2\x80\x94they lived in one place after another\xe2\x80\x94but an elder brother\r\nused to lend her books.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were to tell you everything\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she stopped and smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would\r\ntake too long,\xe2\x80\x9d she concluded. \xe2\x80\x9cI married when I was thirty, and I have\r\ntwo children. My husband is a scholar. And now\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s your turn,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nnodded at Hirst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve left out a great deal,\xe2\x80\x9d he reproved her. \xe2\x80\x9cMy name is St. John\r\nAlaric Hirst,\xe2\x80\x9d he began in a jaunty tone of voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m twenty-four\r\nyears old. I\xe2\x80\x99m the son of the Reverend Sidney Hirst, vicar of Great\r\nWappyng in Norfolk. Oh, I got scholarships\r\neverywhere\xe2\x80\x94Westminster\xe2\x80\x94King\xe2\x80\x99s. I\xe2\x80\x99m now a fellow of King\xe2\x80\x99s. Don\xe2\x80\x99t it\r\nsound dreary? Parents both alive (alas). Two brothers and one sister.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a very distinguished young man,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the three, or is it five, most distinguished men in England,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHewet remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite correct,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all very interesting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen after a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cBut of course\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve left out the only questions that matter. For instance, are we\r\nChristians?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI am not,\xe2\x80\x9d both the young men replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel stated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou believe in a personal God?\xe2\x80\x9d Hirst demanded, turning round and\r\nfixing her with his eyeglasses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe\xe2\x80\x94I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel stammered, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe there are things we\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know about, and the world might change in a minute and anything\r\nappear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this Helen laughed outright. \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not a\r\nChristian. You\xe2\x80\x99ve never thought what you are.\xe2\x80\x94And there are lots of\r\nother questions,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthough perhaps we can\xe2\x80\x99t ask them\r\nyet.\xe2\x80\x9d Although they had talked so freely they were all uncomfortably\r\nconscious that they really knew nothing about each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe important questions,\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet pondered, \xe2\x80\x9cthe really interesting\r\nones. I doubt that one ever does ask them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel, who was slow to accept the fact that only a very few things can\r\nbe said even by people who know each other well, insisted on knowing\r\nwhat he meant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been in love?\xe2\x80\x9d she enquired. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that the kind of\r\nquestion you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Helen laughed at her, benignantly strewing her with handfuls of\r\nthe long tasselled grass, for she was so brave and so foolish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like having a puppy in the house having\r\nyou with one\xe2\x80\x94a puppy that brings one\xe2\x80\x99s underclothes down into the\r\nhall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut again the sunny earth in front of them was crossed by fantastic\r\nwavering figures, the shadows of men and women.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere they are!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs. Elliot. There was a touch of\r\npeevishness in her voice. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ve had _such_ a hunt to find you. Do\r\nyou know what the time is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Elliot and Mr. and Mrs. Thornbury now confronted them; Mrs. Elliot\r\nwas holding out her watch, and playfully tapping it upon the face.\r\nHewet was recalled to the fact that this was a party for which he was\r\nresponsible, and he immediately led them back to the watch-tower, where\r\nthey were to have tea before starting home again. A bright crimson\r\nscarf fluttered from the top of the wall, which Mr. Perrott and Evelyn\r\nwere tying to a stone as the others came up. The heat had changed just\r\nso far that instead of sitting in the shadow they sat in the sun, which\r\nwas still hot enough to paint their faces red and yellow, and to colour\r\ngreat sections of the earth beneath them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing half so nice as tea!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Thornbury, taking her\r\ncup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you remember as a child chopping up hay\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe spoke much more quickly than usual, and kept her eye fixed upon\r\nMrs. Thornbury, \xe2\x80\x9cand pretending it was tea, and getting scolded by the\r\nnurses\xe2\x80\x94why I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine, except that nurses are such brutes, won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nallow pepper instead of salt though there\xe2\x80\x99s no earthly harm in it.\r\nWeren\xe2\x80\x99t your nurses just the same?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring this speech Susan came into the group, and sat down by Helen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside. A few minutes later Mr. Venning strolled up from the opposite\r\ndirection. He was a little flushed, and in the mood to answer\r\nhilariously whatever was said to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you been doing to that old chap\xe2\x80\x99s grave?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, pointing\r\nto the red flag which floated from the top of the stones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have tried to make him forget his misfortune in having died three\r\nhundred years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Perrott.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be awful\xe2\x80\x94to be dead!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated Evelyn M.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be dead?\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would be awful. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite\r\neasy to imagine. When you go to bed to-night fold your hands so\xe2\x80\x94breathe\r\nslower and slower\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He lay back with his hands clasped upon his breast,\r\nand his eyes shut, \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured in an even monotonous voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshall never, never, never move again.\xe2\x80\x9d His body, lying flat among them,\r\ndid for a moment suggest death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a horrible exhibition, Mr. Hewet!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Thornbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore cake for us!\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI assure you there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing horrible about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet, sitting\r\nup and laying hands upon the cake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so natural,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople with children should make them\r\ndo that exercise every night. . . . Not that I look forward to being\r\ndead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when you allude to a grave,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Thornbury, who spoke almost\r\nfor the first time, \xe2\x80\x9chave you any authority for calling that ruin a\r\ngrave? I am quite with you in refusing to accept the common\r\ninterpretation which declares it to be the remains of an Elizabethan\r\nwatch-tower\xe2\x80\x94any more than I believe that the circular mounds or barrows\r\nwhich we find on the top of our English downs were camps. The\r\nantiquaries call everything a camp. I am always asking them, Well then,\r\nwhere do you think our ancestors kept their cattle? Half the camps in\r\nEngland are merely the ancient pound or barton as we call it in my part\r\nof the world. The argument that no one would keep his cattle in such\r\nexposed and inaccessible spots has no weight at all, if you reflect\r\nthat in those days a man\xe2\x80\x99s cattle were his capital, his stock-in-trade,\r\nhis daughter\xe2\x80\x99s dowries. Without cattle he was a serf, another man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nman. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d His eyes slowly lost their intensity, and he muttered a few\r\nconcluding words under his breath, looking curiously old and forlorn.\r\n\r\nHughling Elliot, who might have been expected to engage the old\r\ngentleman in argument, was absent at the moment. He now came up holding\r\nout a large square of cotton upon which a fine design was printed in\r\npleasant bright colours that made his hand look pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bargain,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced, laying it down on the cloth. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve just\r\nbought it from the big man with the ear-rings. Fine, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? It\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t suit every one, of course, but it\xe2\x80\x99s just the thing\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t it,\r\nHilda?\xe2\x80\x94for Mrs. Raymond Parry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Raymond Parry!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Helen and Mrs. Thornbury at the same\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other as though a mist hitherto obscuring their\r\nfaces had been blown away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94you have been to those wonderful parties too?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Elliot asked\r\nwith interest.\r\n\r\nMrs. Parry\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room, though thousands of miles away, behind a\r\nvast curve of water on a tiny piece of earth, came before their eyes.\r\nThey who had had no solidity or anchorage before seemed to be attached\r\nto it somehow, and at once grown more substantial. Perhaps they had\r\nbeen in the drawing-room at the same moment; perhaps they had passed\r\neach other on the stairs; at any rate they knew some of the same\r\npeople. They looked one another up and down with new interest. But they\r\ncould do no more than look at each other, for there was no time to\r\nenjoy the fruits of the discovery. The donkeys were advancing, and it\r\nwas advisable to begin the descent immediately, for the night fell so\r\nquickly that it would be dark before they were home again.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, remounting in order, they filed off down the hillside.\r\nScraps of talk came floating back from one to another. There were jokes\r\nto begin with, and laughter; some walked part of the way, and picked\r\nflowers, and sent stones bounding before them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho writes the best Latin verse in your college, Hirst?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Elliot\r\ncalled back incongruously, and Mr. Hirst returned that he had no idea.\r\n\r\nThe dusk fell as suddenly as the natives had warned them, the hollows\r\nof the mountain on either side filling up with darkness and the path\r\nbecoming so dim that it was surprising to hear the donkeys\xe2\x80\x99 hooves\r\nstill striking on hard rock. Silence fell upon one, and then upon\r\nanother, until they were all silent, their minds spilling out into the\r\ndeep blue air. The way seemed shorter in the dark than in the day; and\r\nsoon the lights of the town were seen on the flat far beneath them.\r\n\r\nSuddenly some one cried, \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a moment the slow yellow drop rose again from the plain below; it\r\nrose, paused, opened like a flower, and fell in a shower of drops.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFireworks,\xe2\x80\x9d they cried.\r\n\r\nAnother went up more quickly; and then another; they could almost hear\r\nit twist and roar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome Saint\xe2\x80\x99s day, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice. The rush and embrace of\r\nthe rockets as they soared up into the air seemed like the fiery way in\r\nwhich lovers suddenly rose and united, leaving the crowd gazing up at\r\nthem with strained white faces. But Susan and Arthur, riding down the\r\nhill, never said a word to each other, and kept accurately apart.\r\n\r\nThen the fireworks became erratic, and soon they ceased altogether, and\r\nthe rest of the journey was made almost in darkness, the mountain being\r\na great shadow behind them, and bushes and trees little shadows which\r\nthrew darkness across the road. Among the plane-trees they separated,\r\nbundling into carriages and driving off, without saying good-night, or\r\nsaying it only in a half-muffled way.\r\n\r\nIt was so late that there was no time for normal conversation between\r\ntheir arrival at the hotel and their retirement to bed. But Hirst\r\nwandered into Hewet\xe2\x80\x99s room with a collar in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Hewet,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, on the crest of a gigantic yawn, \xe2\x80\x9cthat was\r\na great success, I consider.\xe2\x80\x9d He yawned. \xe2\x80\x9cBut take care you\xe2\x80\x99re not\r\nlanded with that young woman. . . . I don\xe2\x80\x99t really like young women. .\r\n. .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHewet was too much drugged by hours in the open air to make any reply.\r\nIn fact every one of the party was sound asleep within ten minutes or\r\nso of each other, with the exception of Susan Warrington. She lay for a\r\nconsiderable time looking blankly at the wall opposite, her hands\r\nclasped above her heart, and her light burning by her side. All\r\narticulate thought had long ago deserted her; her heart seemed to have\r\ngrown to the size of a sun, and to illuminate her entire body, shedding\r\nlike the sun a steady tide of warmth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m happy, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI love every one. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Susan\xe2\x80\x99s engagement had been approved at home, and made public to\r\nany one who took an interest in it at the hotel\xe2\x80\x94and by this time the\r\nsociety at the hotel was divided so as to point to invisible\r\nchalk-marks such as Mr. Hirst had described, the news was felt to\r\njustify some celebration\xe2\x80\x94an expedition? That had been done already. A\r\ndance then. The advantage of a dance was that it abolished one of those\r\nlong evenings which were apt to become tedious and lead to absurdly\r\nearly hours in spite of bridge.\r\n\r\nTwo or three people standing under the erect body of the stuffed\r\nleopard in the hall very soon had the matter decided. Evelyn slid a\r\npace or two this way and that, and pronounced that the floor was\r\nexcellent. Signor Rodriguez informed them of an old Spaniard who\r\nfiddled at weddings\xe2\x80\x94fiddled so as to make a tortoise waltz; and his\r\ndaughter, although endowed with eyes as black as coal-scuttles, had the\r\nsame power over the piano. If there were any so sick or so surly as to\r\nprefer sedentary occupations on the night in question to spinning and\r\nwatching others spin, the drawing-room and billiard-room were theirs.\r\nHewet made it his business to conciliate the outsiders as much as\r\npossible. To Hirst\xe2\x80\x99s theory of the invisible chalk-marks he would pay\r\nno attention whatever. He was treated to a snub or two, but, in reward,\r\nfound obscure lonely gentlemen delighted to have this opportunity of\r\ntalking to their kind, and the lady of doubtful character showed every\r\nsymptom of confiding her case to him in the near future. Indeed it was\r\nmade quite obvious to him that the two or three hours between dinner\r\nand bed contained an amount of unhappiness, which was really pitiable,\r\nso many people had not succeeded in making friends.\r\n\r\nIt was settled that the dance was to be on Friday, one week after the\r\nengagement, and at dinner Hewet declared himself satisfied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re all coming!\xe2\x80\x9d he told Hirst. \xe2\x80\x9cPepper!\xe2\x80\x9d he called, seeing\r\nWilliam Pepper slip past in the wake of the soup with a pamphlet\r\nbeneath his arm, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re counting on you to open the ball.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will certainly put sleep out of the question,\xe2\x80\x9d Pepper returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are to take the floor with Miss Allan,\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet continued,\r\nconsulting a sheet of pencilled notes.\r\n\r\nPepper stopped and began a discourse upon round dances, country dances,\r\nmorris dances, and quadrilles, all of which are entirely superior to\r\nthe bastard waltz and spurious polka which have ousted them most\r\nunjustly in contemporary popularity\xe2\x80\x94when the waiters gently pushed him\r\non to his table in the corner.\r\n\r\nThe dining-room at this moment had a certain fantastic resemblance to a\r\nfarmyard scattered with grain on which bright pigeons kept descending.\r\nAlmost all the ladies wore dresses which they had not yet displayed,\r\nand their hair rose in waves and scrolls so as to appear like carved\r\nwood in Gothic churches rather than hair. The dinner was shorter and\r\nless formal than usual, even the waiters seeming to be affected with\r\nthe general excitement. Ten minutes before the clock struck nine the\r\ncommittee made a tour through the ballroom. The hall, when emptied of\r\nits furniture, brilliantly lit, adorned with flowers whose scent tinged\r\nthe air, presented a wonderful appearance of ethereal gaiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like a starlit sky on an absolutely cloudless night,\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet\r\nmurmured, looking about him, at the airy empty room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA heavenly floor, anyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d Evelyn added, taking a run and sliding two\r\nor three feet along.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about those curtains?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hirst. The crimson curtains were\r\ndrawn across the long windows. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a perfect night outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but curtains inspire confidence,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Allan decided. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the\r\nball is in full swing it will be time to draw them. We might even open\r\nthe windows a little. . . . If we do it now elderly people will imagine\r\nthere are draughts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer wisdom had come to be recognised, and held in respect. Meanwhile as\r\nthey stood talking, the musicians were unwrapping their instruments,\r\nand the violin was repeating again and again a note struck upon the\r\npiano. Everything was ready to begin.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 pause, the father, the daughter, and the\r\nson-in-law who played the horn flourished with one accord. Like the\r\nrats who followed the piper, heads instantly appeared in the doorway.\r\nThere was another flourish; and then the trio dashed spontaneously into\r\nthe triumphant swing of the waltz. It was as though the room were\r\ninstantly flooded with water. After a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation first one\r\ncouple, then another, leapt into mid-stream, and went round and round\r\nin the eddies. The rhythmic swish of the dancers sounded like a\r\nswirling pool. By degrees the room grew perceptibly hotter. The smell\r\nof kid gloves mingled with the strong scent of flowers. The eddies\r\nseemed to circle faster and faster, until the music wrought itself into\r\na crash, ceased, and the circles were smashed into little separate\r\nbits. The couples struck off in different directions, leaving a thin\r\nrow of elderly people stuck fast to the walls, and here and there a\r\npiece of trimming or a handkerchief or a flower lay upon the floor.\r\nThere was a pause, and then the music started again, the eddies\r\nwhirled, the couples circled round in them, until there was a crash,\r\nand the circles were broken up into separate pieces.\r\n\r\nWhen this had happened about five times, Hirst, who leant against a\r\nwindow-frame, like some singular gargoyle, perceived that Helen Ambrose\r\nand Rachel stood in the doorway. The crowd was such that they could not\r\nmove, but he recognised them by a piece of Helen\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder and a\r\nglimpse of Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s head turning round. He made his way to them; they\r\ngreeted him with relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are suffering the tortures of the damned,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is my idea of hell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel.\r\n\r\nHer eyes were bright and she looked bewildered.\r\n\r\nHewet and Miss Allan, who had been waltzing somewhat laboriously,\r\npaused and greeted the newcomers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis _is_ nice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet. \xe2\x80\x9cBut where is Mr. Ambrose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPindar,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen. \xe2\x80\x9cMay a married woman who was forty in October\r\ndance? I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand still.\xe2\x80\x9d She seemed to fade into Hewet, and they\r\nboth dissolved in the crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must follow suit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst to Rachel, and he took her resolutely\r\nby the elbow. Rachel, without being expert, danced well, because of a\r\ngood ear for rhythm, but Hirst had no taste for music, and a few\r\ndancing lessons at Cambridge had only put him into possession of the\r\nanatomy of a waltz, without imparting any of its spirit. A single turn\r\nproved to them that their methods were incompatible; instead of fitting\r\ninto each other their bones seemed to jut out in angles making smooth\r\nturning an impossibility, and cutting, moreover, into the circular\r\nprogress of the other dancers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we stop?\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst. Rachel gathered from his expression that\r\nhe was annoyed.\r\n\r\nThey staggered to seats in the corner, from which they had a view of\r\nthe room. It was still surging, in waves of blue and yellow, striped by\r\nthe black evening-clothes of the gentlemen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn amazing spectacle,\xe2\x80\x9d Hirst remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you dance much in London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThey were both breathing fast, and both a little excited, though each\r\nwas determined not to show any excitement at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScarcely ever. Do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy people give a dance every Christmas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t half a bad floor,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel said. Hirst did not attempt to\r\nanswer her platitude. He sat quite silent, staring at the dancers.\r\nAfter three minutes the silence became so intolerable to Rachel that\r\nshe was goaded to advance another commonplace about the beauty of the\r\nnight. Hirst interrupted her ruthlessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas that all nonsense what you said the other day about being a\r\nChristian and having no education?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was practically true,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I also play the piano very\r\nwell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbetter, I expect than any one in this room. You are\r\nthe most distinguished man in England, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked shyly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the three,\xe2\x80\x9d he corrected.\r\n\r\nHelen whirling past here tossed a fan into Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s lap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is very beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d Hirst remarked.\r\n\r\nThey were again silent. Rachel was wondering whether he thought her\r\nalso nice-looking; St. John was considering the immense difficulty of\r\ntalking to girls who had no experience of life. Rachel had obviously\r\nnever thought or felt or seen anything, and she might be intelligent or\r\nshe might be just like all the rest. But Hewet\xe2\x80\x99s taunt rankled in his\r\nmind\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to get on with women,\xe2\x80\x9d and he was determined\r\nto profit by this opportunity. Her evening-clothes bestowed on her just\r\nthat degree of unreality and distinction which made it romantic to\r\nspeak to her, and stirred a desire to talk, which irritated him because\r\nhe did not know how to begin. He glanced at her, and she seemed to him\r\nvery remote and inexplicable, very young and chaste. He drew a sigh,\r\nand began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout books now. What have you read? Just Shakespeare and the Bible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t read many classics,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel stated. She was slightly annoyed\r\nby his jaunty and rather unnatural manner, while his masculine\r\nacquirements induced her to take a very modest view of her own power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you mean to tell me you\xe2\x80\x99ve reached the age of twenty-four without\r\nreading Gibbon?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon Dieu!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, throwing out his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must begin\r\nto-morrow. I shall send you my copy. What I want to know is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he looked\r\nat her critically. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, the problem is, can one really talk to\r\nyou? Have you got a mind, or are you like the rest of your sex? You\r\nseem to me absurdly young compared with men of your age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel looked at him but said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout Gibbon,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you think you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to appreciate\r\nhim? He\xe2\x80\x99s the test, of course. It\xe2\x80\x99s awfully difficult to tell about\r\nwomen,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9chow much, I mean, is due to lack of training,\r\nand how much is native incapacity. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see myself why you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand\xe2\x80\x94only I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ve led an absurd life until now\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\njust walked in a crocodile, I suppose, with your hair down your back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe music was again beginning. Hirst\xe2\x80\x99s eye wandered about the room in\r\nsearch of Mrs. Ambrose. With the best will in the world he was\r\nconscious that they were not getting on well together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like awfully to lend you books,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, buttoning his gloves,\r\nand rising from his seat. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall meet again. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave you\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got up and left her.\r\n\r\nRachel looked round. She felt herself surrounded, like a child at a\r\nparty, by the faces of strangers all hostile to her, with hooked noses\r\nand sneering, indifferent eyes. She was by a window, she pushed it open\r\nwith a jerk. She stepped out into the garden. Her eyes swam with tears\r\nof rage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn that man!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, having acquired some of Helen\xe2\x80\x99s words.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn his insolence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stood in the middle of the pale square of light which the window\r\nshe had opened threw upon the grass. The forms of great black trees\r\nrose massively in front of her. She stood still, looking at them,\r\nshivering slightly with anger and excitement. She heard the trampling\r\nand swinging of the dancers behind her, and the rhythmic sway of the\r\nwaltz music.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are trees,\xe2\x80\x9d she said aloud. Would the trees make up for St. John\r\nHirst? She would be a Persian princess far from civilisation, riding\r\nher horse upon the mountains alone, and making her women sing to her in\r\nthe evening, far from all this, from the strife and men and women\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nform came out of the shadow; a little red light burnt high up in its\r\nblackness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vinrace, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet, peering at her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were dancing\r\nwith Hirst?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s made me furious!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried vehemently. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one\xe2\x80\x99s any right to be\r\ninsolent!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInsolent?\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet repeated, taking his cigar from his mouth in\r\nsurprise. \xe2\x80\x9cHirst\xe2\x80\x94insolent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s insolent to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel, and stopped. She did not know exactly\r\nwhy she had been made so angry. With a great effort she pulled herself\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, the vision of Helen and her mockery before her,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say I\xe2\x80\x99m a fool.\xe2\x80\x9d She made as though she were going back into\r\nthe ballroom, but Hewet stopped her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease explain to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel sure Hirst didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to hurt\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Rachel tried to explain, she found it very difficult. She could\r\nnot say that she found the vision of herself walking in a crocodile\r\nwith her hair down her back peculiarly unjust and horrible, nor could\r\nshe explain why Hirst\xe2\x80\x99s assumption of the superiority of his nature and\r\nexperience had seemed to her not only galling but terrible\xe2\x80\x94as if a gate\r\nhad clanged in her face. Pacing up and down the terrace beside Hewet\r\nshe said bitterly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no good; we should live separate; we cannot understand each\r\nother; we only bring out what\xe2\x80\x99s worst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHewet brushed aside her generalisation as to the natures of the two\r\nsexes, for such generalisations bored him and seemed to him generally\r\nuntrue. But, knowing Hirst, he guessed fairly accurately what had\r\nhappened, and, though secretly much amused, was determined that Rachel\r\nshould not store the incident away in her mind to take its place in the\r\nview she had of life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you\xe2\x80\x99ll hate him,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is wrong. Poor old Hirst\xe2\x80\x94he\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t help his method. And really, Miss Vinrace, he was doing his best;\r\nhe was paying you a compliment\xe2\x80\x94he was trying\xe2\x80\x94he was trying\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he could\r\nnot finish for the laughter that overcame him.\r\n\r\nRachel veered round suddenly and laughed out too. She saw that there\r\nwas something ridiculous about Hirst, and perhaps about herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s his way of making friends, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94I shall\r\ndo my part. I shall begin\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Ugly in body, repulsive in mind as you are,\r\nMr. Hirst\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear, hear!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hewet. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way to treat him. You see, Miss\r\nVinrace, you must make allowances for Hirst. He\xe2\x80\x99s lived all his life in\r\nfront of a looking-glass, so to speak, in a beautiful panelled room,\r\nhung with Japanese prints and lovely old chairs and tables, just one\r\nsplash of colour, you know, in the right place,\xe2\x80\x94between the windows I\r\nthink it is,\xe2\x80\x94and there he sits hour after hour with his toes on the\r\nfender, talking about philosophy and God and his liver and his heart\r\nand the hearts of his friends. They\xe2\x80\x99re all broken. You can\xe2\x80\x99t expect him\r\nto be at his best in a ballroom. He wants a cosy, smoky, masculine\r\nplace, where he can stretch his legs out, and only speak when he\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\nsomething to say. For myself, I find it rather dreary. But I do respect\r\nit. They\xe2\x80\x99re all so much in earnest. They do take the serious things\r\nvery seriously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe description of Hirst\xe2\x80\x99s way of life interested Rachel so much that\r\nshe almost forgot her private grudge against him, and her respect\r\nrevived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are really very clever then?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course they are. So far as brains go I think it\xe2\x80\x99s true what he said\r\nthe other day; they\xe2\x80\x99re the cleverest people in England. But\xe2\x80\x94you ought\r\nto take him in hand,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal more in him\r\nthan\xe2\x80\x99s ever been got at. He wants some one to laugh at him. . . . The\r\nidea of Hirst telling you that you\xe2\x80\x99ve had no experiences! Poor old\r\nHirst!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had been pacing up and down the terrace while they talked, and now\r\none by one the dark windows were uncurtained by an invisible hand, and\r\npanes of light fell regularly at equal intervals upon the grass. They\r\nstopped to look in at the drawing-room, and perceived Mr. Pepper\r\nwriting alone at a table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Pepper writing to his aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet. \xe2\x80\x9cShe must be a very\r\nremarkable old lady, eighty-five he tells me, and he takes her for\r\nwalking tours in the New Forest. . . . Pepper!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, rapping on\r\nthe window. \xe2\x80\x9cGo and do your duty. Miss Allan expects you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the windows of the ballroom, the swing of the dancers\r\nand the lilt of the music was irresistible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we?\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet, and they clasped hands and swept off\r\nmagnificently into the great swirling pool. Although this was only the\r\nsecond time they had met, the first time they had seen a man and woman\r\nkissing each other, and the second time Mr. Hewet had found that a\r\nyoung woman angry is very like a child. So that when they joined hands\r\nin the dance they felt more at their ease than is usual.\r\n\r\nIt was midnight and the dance was now at its height. Servants were\r\npeeping in at the windows; the garden was sprinkled with the white\r\nshapes of couples sitting out. Mrs. Thornbury and Mrs. Elliot sat side\r\nby side under a palm tree, holding fans, handkerchiefs, and brooches\r\ndeposited in their laps by flushed maidens. Occasionally they exchanged\r\ncomments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Warrington _does_ look happy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Elliot; they both\r\nsmiled; they both sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has a great deal of character,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Thornbury, alluding to\r\nArthur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd character is what one wants,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Elliot. \xe2\x80\x9cNow that young\r\nman is _clever_ enough,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, nodding at Hirst, who came past\r\nwith Miss Allan on his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does not look strong,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Thornbury. \xe2\x80\x9cHis complexion is not\r\ngood.\xe2\x80\x94Shall I tear it off?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, for Rachel had stopped,\r\nconscious of a long strip trailing behind her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you are enjoying yourselves?\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet asked the ladies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a very familiar position for me!\xe2\x80\x9d smiled Mrs. Thornbury. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave brought out five daughters\xe2\x80\x94and they all loved dancing! You love it\r\ntoo, Miss Vinrace?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, looking at Rachel with maternal eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow I did when I was your age. How I used to beg my mother to let me\r\nstay\xe2\x80\x94and now I sympathise with the poor mothers\xe2\x80\x94but I sympathise with\r\nthe daughters too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled sympathetically, and at the same time rather keenly, at\r\nRachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey seem to find a great deal to say to each other,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nElliot, looking significantly at the backs of the couple as they turned\r\naway. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you notice at the picnic? He was the only person who could\r\nmake her utter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer father is a very interesting man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Thornbury. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has\r\none of the largest shipping businesses in Hull. He made a very able\r\nreply, you remember, to Mr. Asquith at the last election. It is so\r\ninteresting to find that a man of his experience is a strong\r\nProtectionist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe would have liked to discuss politics, which interested her more\r\nthan personalities, but Mrs. Elliot would only talk about the Empire in\r\na less abstract form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear there are dreadful accounts from England about the rats,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cA sister-in-law, who lives at Norwich, tells me it has been\r\nquite unsafe to order poultry. The plague\xe2\x80\x94you see. It attacks the rats,\r\nand through them other creatures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the local authorities are not taking proper steps?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs.\r\nThornbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat she does not say. But she describes the attitude of the educated\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x94who should know better\xe2\x80\x94as callous in the extreme. Of course, my\r\nsister-in-law is one of those active modern women, who always takes\r\nthings up, you know\xe2\x80\x94the kind of woman one admires, though one does not\r\nfeel, at least I do not feel\xe2\x80\x94but then she has a constitution of iron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Elliot, brought back to the consideration of her own delicacy,\r\nhere sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very animated face,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Thornbury, looking at Evelyn M. who\r\nhad stopped near them to pin tight a scarlet flower at her breast. It\r\nwould not stay, and, with a spirited gesture of impatience, she thrust\r\nit into her partner\xe2\x80\x99s button-hole. He was a tall melancholy youth, who\r\nreceived the gift as a knight might receive his lady\xe2\x80\x99s token.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery trying to the eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d was Mrs. Eliot\xe2\x80\x99s next remark, after watching\r\nthe yellow whirl in which so few of the whirlers had either name or\r\ncharacter for her, for a few minutes. Bursting out of the crowd, Helen\r\napproached them, and took a vacant chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I sit by you?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, smiling and breathing fast. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I\r\nought to be ashamed of myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, sitting down, \xe2\x80\x9cat my age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer beauty, now that she was flushed and animated, was more expansive\r\nthan usual, and both the ladies felt the same desire to touch her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _am_ enjoying myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she panted. \xe2\x80\x9cMovement\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t it amazing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have always heard that nothing comes up to dancing if one is a good\r\ndancer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Thornbury, looking at her with a smile.\r\n\r\nHelen swayed slightly as if she sat on wires.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could dance for ever!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey ought to let themselves go\r\nmore!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThey ought to leap and swing. Look! How they\r\nmince!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen those wonderful Russian dancers?\xe2\x80\x9d began Mrs. Elliot. But\r\nHelen saw her partner coming and rose as the moon rises. She was half\r\nround the room before they took their eyes off her, for they could not\r\nhelp admiring her, although they thought it a little odd that a woman\r\nof her age should enjoy dancing.\r\n\r\nDirectly Helen was left alone for a minute she was joined by St. John\r\nHirst, who had been watching for an opportunity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you mind sitting out with me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m quite incapable\r\nof dancing.\xe2\x80\x9d He piloted Helen to a corner which was supplied with two\r\narm-chairs, and thus enjoyed the advantage of semi-privacy. They sat\r\ndown, and for a few minutes Helen was too much under the influence of\r\ndancing to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAstonishing!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed at last. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of shape can she think\r\nher body is?\xe2\x80\x9d This remark was called forth by a lady who came past\r\nthem, waddling rather than walking, and leaning on the arm of a stout\r\nman with globular green eyes set in a fat white face. Some support was\r\nnecessary, for she was very stout, and so compressed that the upper\r\npart of her body hung considerably in advance of her feet, which could\r\nonly trip in tiny steps, owing to the tightness of the skirt round her\r\nankles. The dress itself consisted of a small piece of shiny yellow\r\nsatin, adorned here and there indiscriminately with round shields of\r\nblue and green beads made to imitate hues of a peacock\xe2\x80\x99s breast. On the\r\nsummit of a frothy castle of hair a purple plume stood erect, while her\r\nshort neck was encircled by a black velvet ribbon knobbed with gems,\r\nand golden bracelets were tightly wedged into the flesh of her fat\r\ngloved arms. She had the face of an impertinent but jolly little pig,\r\nmottled red under a dusting of powder.\r\n\r\nSt. John could not join in Helen\xe2\x80\x99s laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt makes me sick,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole thing makes me sick. . . .\r\nConsider the minds of those people\xe2\x80\x94their feelings. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you agree?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always make a vow never to go to another party of any description,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHelen replied, \xe2\x80\x9cand I always break it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe leant back in her chair and looked laughingly at the young man. She\r\ncould see that he was genuinely cross, if at the same time slightly\r\nexcited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, resuming his jaunty tone, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose one must just\r\nmake up one\xe2\x80\x99s mind to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere never will be more than five people in the world worth talking\r\nto.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSlowly the flush and sparkle in Helen\xe2\x80\x99s face died away, and she looked\r\nas quiet and as observant as usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive people?\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cI should say there were more than five.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been very fortunate, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst. \xe2\x80\x9cOr perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nvery unfortunate.\xe2\x80\x9d He became silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you say I was a difficult kind of person to get on with?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost clever people are when they\xe2\x80\x99re young,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd of course I am\xe2\x80\x94immensely clever,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m infinitely\r\ncleverer than Hewet. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite possible,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued in his\r\ncuriously impersonal manner, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be one of the people\r\nwho really matter. That\xe2\x80\x99s utterly different from being clever, though\r\none can\xe2\x80\x99t expect one\xe2\x80\x99s family to see it,\xe2\x80\x9d he added bitterly.\r\n\r\nHelen thought herself justified in asking, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you find your family\r\ndifficult to get on with?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIntolerable. . . . They want me to be a peer and a privy councillor.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve come out here partly in order to settle the matter. It\xe2\x80\x99s got to be\r\nsettled. Either I must go to the bar, or I must stay on in Cambridge.\r\nOf course, there are obvious drawbacks to each, but the arguments\r\ncertainly do seem to me in favour of Cambridge. This kind of thing!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwaved his hand at the crowded ballroom. \xe2\x80\x9cRepulsive. I\xe2\x80\x99m conscious of\r\ngreat powers of affection too. I\xe2\x80\x99m not susceptible, of course, in the\r\nway Hewet is. I\xe2\x80\x99m very fond of a few people. I think, for example, that\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s something to be said for my mother, though she is in many ways\r\nso deplorable. . . . At Cambridge, of course, I should inevitably\r\nbecome the most important man in the place, but there are other reasons\r\nwhy I dread Cambridge\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he ceased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you finding me a dreadful bore?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. He changed curiously\r\nfrom a friend confiding in a friend to a conventional young man at a\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen. \xe2\x80\x9cI like it very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t think,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, speaking almost with emotion, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a\r\ndifference it makes finding someone to talk to! Directly I saw you I\r\nfelt you might possibly understand me. I\xe2\x80\x99m very fond of Hewet, but he\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t the remotest idea what I\xe2\x80\x99m like. You\xe2\x80\x99re the only woman I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever\r\nmet who seems to have the faintest conception of what I mean when I say\r\na thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next dance was beginning; it was the Barcarolle out of Hoffman,\r\nwhich made Helen beat her toe in time to it; but she felt that after\r\nsuch a compliment it was impossible to get up and go, and, besides\r\nbeing amused, she was really flattered, and the honesty of his conceit\r\nattracted her. She suspected that he was not happy, and was\r\nsufficiently feminine to wish to receive confidences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very old,\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe odd thing is that I don\xe2\x80\x99t find you old at all,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nfeel as though we were exactly the same age. Moreover\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d here he\r\nhesitated, but took courage from a glance at her face, \xe2\x80\x9cI feel as if I\r\ncould talk quite plainly to you as one does to a man\xe2\x80\x94about the\r\nrelations between the sexes, about . . . and . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of his certainty a slight redness came into his face as he\r\nspoke the last two words.\r\n\r\nShe reassured him at once by the laugh with which she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould hope so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with real cordiality, and the lines which were drawn\r\nabout his nose and lips slackened for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we can behave like civilised human\r\nbeings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCertainly a barrier which usually stands fast had fallen, and it was\r\npossible to speak of matters which are generally only alluded to\r\nbetween men and women when doctors are present, or the shadow of death.\r\nIn five minutes he was telling her the history of his life. It was\r\nlong, for it was full of extremely elaborate incidents, which led on to\r\na discussion of the principles on which morality is founded, and thus\r\nto several very interesting matters, which even in this ballroom had to\r\nbe discussed in a whisper, lest one of the pouter pigeon ladies or\r\nresplendent merchants should overhear them, and proceed to demand that\r\nthey should leave the place. When they had come to an end, or, to speak\r\nmore accurately, when Helen intimated by a slight slackening of her\r\nattention that they had sat there long enough, Hirst rose, exclaiming,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason whatever for all this mystery!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone, except that we are English people,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. She took his\r\narm and they crossed the ball-room, making their way with difficulty\r\nbetween the spinning couples, who were now perceptibly dishevelled, and\r\ncertainly to a critical eye by no means lovely in their shapes. The\r\nexcitement of undertaking a friendship and the length of their talk had\r\nmade them hungry, and they went in search of food to the dining-room,\r\nwhich was now full of people eating at little separate tables. In the\r\ndoorway they met Rachel, going up to dance again with Arthur Venning.\r\nShe was flushed and looked very happy, and Helen was struck by the fact\r\nthat in this mood she was certainly more attractive than the generality\r\nof young women. She had never noticed it so clearly before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnjoying yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, as they stopped for a second.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vinrace,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur answered for her, \xe2\x80\x9chas just made a confession;\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d no idea that dances could be so delightful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve changed my view of life completely!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t say so!\xe2\x80\x9d Helen mocked. They passed on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s typical of Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe changes her view of life\r\nabout every other day. D\xe2\x80\x99you know, I believe you\xe2\x80\x99re just the person I\r\nwant,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as they sat down, \xe2\x80\x9cto help me complete her education?\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s been brought up practically in a nunnery. Her father\xe2\x80\x99s too\r\nabsurd. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing what I can\xe2\x80\x94but I\xe2\x80\x99m too old, and I\xe2\x80\x99m a woman.\r\nWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you talk to her\xe2\x80\x94explain things to her\xe2\x80\x94talk to her, I\r\nmean, as you talk to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have made one attempt already this evening,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. John. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nrather doubt that it was successful. She seems to me so very young and\r\ninexperienced. I have promised to lend her Gibbon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not Gibbon exactly,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen pondered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the facts of life, I\r\nthink\xe2\x80\x94d\xe2\x80\x99you see what I mean? What really goes on, what people feel,\r\nalthough they generally try to hide it? There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be\r\nfrightened of. It\xe2\x80\x99s so much more beautiful than the pretences\xe2\x80\x94always\r\nmore interesting\xe2\x80\x94always better, I should say, than _that_ kind of\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded her head at a table near them, where two girls and two young\r\nmen were chaffing each other very loudly, and carrying on an arch\r\ninsinuating dialogue, sprinkled with endearments, about, it seemed, a\r\npair of stockings or a pair of legs. One of the girls was flirting a\r\nfan and pretending to be shocked, and the sight was very unpleasant,\r\npartly because it was obvious that the girls were secretly hostile to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my old age, however,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m coming to think that it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t much matter in the long run what one does: people always go\r\ntheir own way\xe2\x80\x94nothing will ever influence them.\xe2\x80\x9d She nodded her head at\r\nthe supper party.\r\n\r\nBut St. John did not agree. He said that he thought one could really\r\nmake a great deal of difference by one\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, books and so\r\non, and added that few things at the present time mattered more than\r\nthe enlightenment of women. He sometimes thought that almost everything\r\nwas due to education.\r\n\r\nIn the ballroom, meanwhile, the dancers were being formed into squares\r\nfor the lancers. Arthur and Rachel, Susan and Hewet, Miss Allan and\r\nHughling Elliot found themselves together.\r\n\r\nMiss Allan looked at her watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf-past one,\xe2\x80\x9d she stated. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have to despatch Alexander Pope\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPope!\xe2\x80\x9d snorted Mr. Elliot. \xe2\x80\x9cWho reads Pope, I should like to know? And\r\nas for reading about him\xe2\x80\x94No, no, Miss Allan; be persuaded you will\r\nbenefit the world much more by dancing than by writing.\xe2\x80\x9d It was one of\r\nMr. Elliot\xe2\x80\x99s affectations that nothing in the world could compare with\r\nthe delights of dancing\xe2\x80\x94nothing in the world was so tedious as\r\nliterature. Thus he sought pathetically enough to ingratiate himself\r\nwith the young, and to prove to them beyond a doubt that though married\r\nto a ninny of a wife, and rather pale and bent and careworn by his\r\nweight of learning, he was as much alive as the youngest of them all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a question of bread and butter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Allan calmly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, they seem to expect me.\xe2\x80\x9d She took up her position and pointed\r\na square black toe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Hewet, you bow to me.\xe2\x80\x9d It was evident at once that Miss Allan was\r\nthe only one of them who had a thoroughly sound knowledge of the\r\nfigures of the dance.\r\n\r\nAfter the lancers there was a waltz; after the waltz a polka; and then\r\na terrible thing happened; the music, which had been sounding regularly\r\nwith five-minute pauses, stopped suddenly. The lady with the great dark\r\neyes began to swathe her violin in silk, and the gentleman placed his\r\nhorn carefully in its case. They were surrounded by couples imploring\r\nthem in English, in French, in Spanish, of one more dance, one only; it\r\nwas still early. But the old man at the piano merely exhibited his\r\nwatch and shook his head. He turned up the collar of his coat and\r\nproduced a red silk muffler, which completely dashed his festive\r\nappearance. Strange as it seemed, the musicians were pale and\r\nheavy-eyed; they looked bored and prosaic, as if the summit of their\r\ndesire was cold meat and beer, succeeded immediately by bed.\r\n\r\nRachel was one of those who had begged them to continue. When they\r\nrefused she began turning over the sheets of dance music which lay upon\r\nthe piano. The pieces were generally bound in coloured covers, with\r\npictures on them of romantic scenes\xe2\x80\x94gondoliers astride on the crescent\r\nof the moon, nuns peering through the bars of a convent window, or\r\nyoung women with their hair down pointing a gun at the stars. She\r\nremembered that the general effect of the music to which they had\r\ndanced so gaily was one of passionate regret for dead love and the\r\ninnocent years of youth; dreadful sorrows had always separated the\r\ndancers from their past happiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo wonder they get sick of playing stuff like this,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked\r\nreading a bar or two; \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re really hymn tunes, played very fast,\r\nwith bits out of Wagner and Beethoven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you play? Would you play? Anything, so long as we can dance to it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nFrom all sides her gift for playing the piano was insisted upon, and\r\nshe had to consent. As very soon she had played the only pieces of\r\ndance music she could remember, she went on to play an air from a\r\nsonata by Mozart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s not a dance,\xe2\x80\x9d said some one pausing by the piano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, emphatically nodding her head. \xe2\x80\x9cInvent the\r\nsteps.\xe2\x80\x9d Sure of her melody she marked the rhythm boldly so as to\r\nsimplify the way. Helen caught the idea; seized Miss Allan by the arm,\r\nand whirled round the room, now curtseying, now spinning round, now\r\ntripping this way and that like a child skipping through a meadow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the dance for people who don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to dance!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\nThe tune changed to a minuet; St. John hopped with incredible swiftness\r\nfirst on his left leg, then on his right; the tune flowed melodiously;\r\nHewet, swaying his arms and holding out the tails of his coat, swam\r\ndown the room in imitation of the voluptuous dreamy dance of an Indian\r\nmaiden dancing before her Rajah. The tune marched; and Miss Allen\r\nadvanced with skirts extended and bowed profoundly to the engaged pair.\r\nOnce their feet fell in with the rhythm they showed a complete lack of\r\nself-consciousness. From Mozart Rachel passed without stopping to old\r\nEnglish hunting songs, carols, and hymn tunes, for, as she had\r\nobserved, any good tune, with a little management, became a tune one\r\ncould dance to. By degrees every person in the room was tripping and\r\nturning in pairs or alone. Mr. Pepper executed an ingenious pointed\r\nstep derived from figure-skating, for which he once held some local\r\nchampionship; while Mrs. Thornbury tried to recall an old country dance\r\nwhich she had seen danced by her father\xe2\x80\x99s tenants in Dorsetshire in the\r\nold days. As for Mr. and Mrs. Elliot, they gallopaded round and round\r\nthe room with such impetuosity that the other dancers shivered at their\r\napproach. Some people were heard to criticise the performance as a\r\nromp; to others it was the most enjoyable part of the evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow for the great round dance!\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet shouted. Instantly a gigantic\r\ncircle was formed, the dancers holding hands and shouting out, \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you\r\nken John Peel,\xe2\x80\x9d as they swung faster and faster and faster, until the\r\nstrain was too great, and one link of the chain\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Thornbury\xe2\x80\x94gave\r\nway, and the rest went flying across the room in all directions, to\r\nland upon the floor or the chairs or in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms as seemed\r\nmost convenient.\r\n\r\nRising from these positions, breathless and unkempt, it struck them for\r\nthe first time that the electric lights pricked the air very vainly,\r\nand instinctively a great many eyes turned to the windows. Yes\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nwas the dawn. While they had been dancing the night had passed, and it\r\nhad come. Outside, the mountains showed very pure and remote; the dew\r\nwas sparkling on the grass, and the sky was flushed with blue, save for\r\nthe pale yellows and pinks in the East. The dancers came crowding to\r\nthe windows, pushed them open, and here and there ventured a foot upon\r\nthe grass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow silly the poor old lights look!\xe2\x80\x9d said Evelyn M. in a curiously\r\nsubdued tone of voice. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd ourselves; it isn\xe2\x80\x99t becoming.\xe2\x80\x9d It was true;\r\nthe untidy hair, and the green and yellow gems, which had seemed so\r\nfestive half an hour ago, now looked cheap and slovenly. The\r\ncomplexions of the elder ladies suffered terribly, and, as if conscious\r\nthat a cold eye had been turned upon them, they began to say good-night\r\nand to make their way up to bed.\r\n\r\nRachel, though robbed of her audience, had gone on playing to herself.\r\nFrom John Peel she passed to Bach, who was at this time the subject of\r\nher intense enthusiasm, and one by one some of the younger dancers came\r\nin from the garden and sat upon the deserted gilt chairs round the\r\npiano, the room being now so clear that they turned out the lights. As\r\nthey sat and listened, their nerves were quieted; the heat and soreness\r\nof their lips, the result of incessant talking and laughing, was\r\nsmoothed away. They sat very still as if they saw a building with\r\nspaces and columns succeeding each other rising in the empty space.\r\nThen they began to see themselves and their lives, and the whole of\r\nhuman life advancing very nobly under the direction of the music. They\r\nfelt themselves ennobled, and when Rachel stopped playing they desired\r\nnothing but sleep.\r\n\r\nSusan rose. \xe2\x80\x9cI think this has been the happiest night of my life!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI do adore music,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as she thanked Rachel. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\njust seems to say all the things one can\xe2\x80\x99t say oneself.\xe2\x80\x9d She gave a\r\nnervous little laugh and looked from one to another with great\r\nbenignity, as though she would like to say something but could not find\r\nthe words in which to express it. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery one\xe2\x80\x99s been so kind\xe2\x80\x94so very\r\nkind,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Then she too went to bed.\r\n\r\nThe party having ended in the very abrupt way in which parties do end,\r\nHelen and Rachel stood by the door with their cloaks on, looking for a\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you realise that there are no carriages left?\xe2\x80\x9d said St.\r\nJohn, who had been out to look. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must sleep here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen; \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay we come too?\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t go to bed. Imagine lying\r\namong bolsters and looking at one\xe2\x80\x99s washstand on a morning like this\xe2\x80\x94Is\r\nthat where you live?\xe2\x80\x9d They had begun to walk down the avenue, and he\r\nturned and pointed at the white and green villa on the hillside, which\r\nseemed to have its eyes shut.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not a light burning, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d Helen asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the sun,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. John. The upper windows had each a spot of\r\ngold on them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid it was my husband, still reading Greek,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAll\r\nthis time he\xe2\x80\x99s been editing _Pindar_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey passed through the town and turned up the steep road, which was\r\nperfectly clear, though still unbordered by shadows. Partly because\r\nthey were tired, and partly because the early light subdued them, they\r\nscarcely spoke, but breathed in the delicious fresh air, which seemed\r\nto belong to a different state of life from the air at midday. When\r\nthey came to the high yellow wall, where the lane turned off from the\r\nroad, Helen was for dismissing the two young men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve come far enough,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cGo back to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut they seemed unwilling to move.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s sit down a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet. He spread his coat on the\r\nground. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s sit down and consider.\xe2\x80\x9d They sat down and looked out\r\nover the bay; it was very still, the sea was rippling faintly, and\r\nlines of green and blue were beginning to stripe it. There were no\r\nsailing boats as yet, but a steamer was anchored in the bay, looking\r\nvery ghostly in the mist; it gave one unearthly cry, and then all was\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nRachel occupied herself in collecting one grey stone after another and\r\nbuilding them into a little cairn; she did it very quietly and\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you\xe2\x80\x99ve changed your view of life, Rachel?\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen.\r\n\r\nRachel added another stone and yawned. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t remember,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nfeel like a fish at the bottom of the sea.\xe2\x80\x9d She yawned again. None of\r\nthese people possessed any power to frighten her out here in the dawn,\r\nand she felt perfectly familiar even with Mr. Hirst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brain, on the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst, \xe2\x80\x9cis in a condition of abnormal\r\nactivity.\xe2\x80\x9d He sat in his favourite position with his arms binding his\r\nlegs together and his chin resting on the top of his knees. \xe2\x80\x9cI see\r\nthrough everything\xe2\x80\x94absolutely everything. Life has no more mysteries\r\nfor me.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke with conviction, but did not appear to wish for an\r\nanswer. Near though they sat, and familiar though they felt, they\r\nseemed mere shadows to each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all those people down there going to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet began dreamily,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthinking such different things,\xe2\x80\x94Miss Warrington, I suppose, is now on\r\nher knees; the Elliots are a little startled, it\xe2\x80\x99s not often _they_ get\r\nout of breath, and they want to get to sleep as quickly as possible;\r\nthen there\xe2\x80\x99s the poor lean young man who danced all night with Evelyn;\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s putting his flower in water and asking himself, \xe2\x80\x98Is this\r\nlove?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94and poor old Perrott, I daresay, can\xe2\x80\x99t get to sleep at all, and\r\nis reading his favourite Greek book to console himself\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\nothers\xe2\x80\x94no, Hirst,\xe2\x80\x9d he wound up, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t find it simple at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a key,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst cryptically. His chin was still upon his\r\nknees and his eyes fixed in front of him.\r\n\r\nA silence followed. Then Helen rose and bade them good-night. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said, \xe2\x80\x9cremember that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to come and see us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey waved good-night and parted, but the two young men did not go back\r\nto the hotel; they went for a walk, during which they scarcely spoke,\r\nand never mentioned the names of the two women, who were, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, the subject of their thoughts. They did not wish\r\nto share their impressions. They returned to the hotel in time for\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were many rooms in the villa, but one room which possessed a\r\ncharacter of its own because the door was always shut, and no sound of\r\nmusic or laughter issued from it. Every one in the house was vaguely\r\nconscious that something went on behind that door, and without in the\r\nleast knowing what it was, were influenced in their own thoughts by the\r\nknowledge that if the passed it the door would be shut, and if they\r\nmade a noise Mr. Ambrose inside would be disturbed. Certain acts\r\ntherefore possessed merit, and others were bad, so that life became\r\nmore harmonious and less disconnected than it would have been had Mr.\r\nAmbrose given up editing _Pindar_, and taken to a nomad existence, in\r\nand out of every room in the house. As it was, every one was conscious\r\nthat by observing certain rules, such as punctuality and quiet, by\r\ncooking well, and performing other small duties, one ode after another\r\nwas satisfactorily restored to the world, and they shared the\r\ncontinuity of the scholar\xe2\x80\x99s life. Unfortunately, as age puts one\r\nbarrier between human beings, and learning another, and sex a third,\r\nMr. Ambrose in his study was some thousand miles distant from the\r\nnearest human being, who in this household was inevitably a woman. He\r\nsat hour after hour among white-leaved books, alone like an idol in an\r\nempty church, still except for the passage of his hand from one side of\r\nthe sheet to another, silent save for an occasional choke, which drove\r\nhim to extend his pipe a moment in the air. As he worked his way\r\nfurther and further into the heart of the poet, his chair became more\r\nand more deeply encircled by books, which lay open on the floor, and\r\ncould only be crossed by a careful process of stepping, so delicate\r\nthat his visitors generally stopped and addressed him from the\r\noutskirts.\r\n\r\nOn the morning after the dance, however, Rachel came into her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom and hailed him twice, \xe2\x80\x9cUncle Ridley,\xe2\x80\x9d before he paid her any\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nAt length he looked over his spectacles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want a book,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cGibbon\xe2\x80\x99s _History of the Roman Empire_.\r\nMay I have it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe watched the lines on her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s face gradually rearrange\r\nthemselves at her question. It had been smooth as a mask before she\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease say that again,\xe2\x80\x9d said her uncle, either because he had not\r\nheard or because he had not understood.\r\n\r\nShe repeated the same words and reddened slightly as she did so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGibbon! What on earth d\xe2\x80\x99you want him for?\xe2\x80\x9d he enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody advised me to read it,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel stammered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t travel about with a miscellaneous collection of\r\neighteenth-century historians!\xe2\x80\x9d her uncle exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cGibbon! Ten big\r\nvolumes at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel said that she was sorry to interrupt, and was turning to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d cried her uncle. He put down his pipe, placed his book on one\r\nside, and rose and led her slowly round the room, holding her by the\r\narm. \xe2\x80\x9cPlato,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, laying one finger on the first of a row of small\r\ndark books, \xe2\x80\x9cand Jorrocks next door, which is wrong. Sophocles, Swift.\r\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t care for German commentators, I presume. French, then. You\r\nread French? You should read Balzac. Then we come to Wordsworth and\r\nColeridge, Pope, Johnson, Addison, Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats. One\r\nthing leads to another. Why is Marlowe here? Mrs. Chailey, I presume.\r\nBut what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of reading if you don\xe2\x80\x99t read Greek? After all, if\r\nyou read Greek, you need never read anything else, pure waste of\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94pure waste of time,\xe2\x80\x9d thus speaking half to himself, with quick\r\nmovements of his hands; they had come round again to the circle of\r\nbooks on the floor, and their progress was stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich shall it be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBalzac,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel, \xe2\x80\x9cor have you the _Speech on the American\r\nRevolution_, Uncle Ridley?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_The Speech on the American Revolution_?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. He looked at her\r\nvery keenly again. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother young man at the dance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. That was Mr. Dalloway,\xe2\x80\x9d she confessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d he flung back his head in recollection of Mr. Dalloway.\r\n\r\nShe chose for herself a volume at random, submitted it to her uncle,\r\nwho, seeing that it was _La Cousine bette_, bade her throw it away if\r\nshe found it too horrible, and was about to leave him when he demanded\r\nwhether she had enjoyed her dance?\r\n\r\nHe then wanted to know what people did at dances, seeing that he had\r\nonly been to one thirty-five years ago, when nothing had seemed to him\r\nmore meaningless and idiotic. Did they enjoy turning round and round to\r\nthe screech of a fiddle? Did they talk, and say pretty things, and if\r\nso, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t they do it, under reasonable conditions? As for\r\nhimself\xe2\x80\x94he sighed and pointed at the signs of industry lying all about\r\nhim, which, in spite of his sigh, filled his face with such\r\nsatisfaction that his niece thought good to leave. On bestowing a kiss\r\nshe was allowed to go, but not until she had bound herself to learn at\r\nany rate the Greek alphabet, and to return her French novel when done\r\nwith, upon which something more suitable would be found for her.\r\n\r\nAs the rooms in which people live are apt to give off something of the\r\nsame shock as their faces when seen for the first time, Rachel walked\r\nvery slowly downstairs, lost in wonder at her uncle, and his books, and\r\nhis neglect of dances, and his queer, utterly inexplicable, but\r\napparently satisfactory view of life, when her eye was caught by a note\r\nwith her name on it lying in the hall. The address was written in a\r\nsmall strong hand unknown to her, and the note, which had no beginning,\r\nran:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nI send the first volume of Gibbon as I promised. Personally I find\r\nlittle to be said for the moderns, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to send you Wedekind\r\nwhen I\xe2\x80\x99ve done him. Donne? Have you read Webster and all that set? I\r\nenvy you reading them for the first time. Completely exhausted after\r\nlast night. And you?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flourish of initials which she took to be St. J. A. H., wound up\r\nthe letter. She was very much flattered that Mr. Hirst should have\r\nremembered her, and fulfilled his promise so quickly.\r\n\r\nThere was still an hour to luncheon, and with Gibbon in one hand, and\r\nBalzac in the other she strolled out of the gate and down the little\r\npath of beaten mud between the olive trees on the slope of the hill. It\r\nwas too hot for climbing hills, but along the valley there were trees\r\nand a grass path running by the river bed. In this land where the\r\npopulation was centred in the towns it was possible to lose sight of\r\ncivilisation in a very short time, passing only an occasional\r\nfarmhouse, where the women were handling red roots in the courtyard; or\r\na little boy lying on his elbows on the hillside surrounded by a flock\r\nof black strong-smelling goats. Save for a thread of water at the\r\nbottom, the river was merely a deep channel of dry yellow stones. On\r\nthe bank grew those trees which Helen had said it was worth the voyage\r\nout merely to see. April had burst their buds, and they bore large\r\nblossoms among their glossy green leaves with petals of a thick\r\nwax-like substance coloured an exquisite cream or pink or deep crimson.\r\nBut filled with one of those unreasonable exultations which start\r\ngenerally from an unknown cause, and sweep whole countries and skies\r\ninto their embrace, she walked without seeing. The night was\r\nencroaching upon the day. Her ears hummed with the tunes she had played\r\nthe night before; she sang, and the singing made her walk faster and\r\nfaster. She did not see distinctly where she was going, the trees and\r\nthe landscape appearing only as masses of green and blue, with an\r\noccasional space of differently coloured sky. Faces of people she had\r\nseen last night came before her; she heard their voices; she stopped\r\nsinging, and began saying things over again or saying things\r\ndifferently, or inventing things that might have been said. The\r\nconstraint of being among strangers in a long silk dress made it\r\nunusually exciting to stride thus alone. Hewet, Hirst, Mr. Venning,\r\nMiss Allan, the music, the light, the dark trees in the garden, the\r\ndawn,\xe2\x80\x94as she walked they went surging round in her head, a tumultuous\r\nbackground from which the present moment, with its opportunity of doing\r\nexactly as she liked, sprung more wonderfully vivid even than the night\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nSo she might have walked until she had lost all knowledge of her way,\r\nhad it not been for the interruption of a tree, which, although it did\r\nnot grow across her path, stopped her as effectively as if the branches\r\nhad struck her in the face. It was an ordinary tree, but to her it\r\nappeared so strange that it might have been the only tree in the world.\r\nDark was the trunk in the middle, and the branches sprang here and\r\nthere, leaving jagged intervals of light between them as distinctly as\r\nif it had but that second risen from the ground. Having seen a sight\r\nthat would last her for a lifetime, and for a lifetime would preserve\r\nthat second, the tree once more sank into the ordinary ranks of trees,\r\nand she was able to seat herself in its shade and to pick the red\r\nflowers with the thin green leaves which were growing beneath it. She\r\nlaid them side by side, flower to flower and stalk to stalk, caressing\r\nthem for walking alone. Flowers and even pebbles in the earth had their\r\nown life and disposition, and brought back the feelings of a child to\r\nwhom they were companions. Looking up, her eye was caught by the line\r\nof the mountains flying out energetically across the sky like the lash\r\nof a curling whip. She looked at the pale distant sky, and the high\r\nbare places on the mountain-tops lying exposed to the sun. When she sat\r\ndown she had dropped her books on to the earth at her feet, and now she\r\nlooked down on them lying there, so square in the grass, a tall stem\r\nbending over and tickling the smooth brown cover of Gibbon, while the\r\nmottled blue Balzac lay naked in the sun. With a feeling that to open\r\nand read would certainly be a surprising experience, she turned the\r\nhistorian\xe2\x80\x99s page and read that\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHis generals, in the early part of his reign, attempted the reduction\r\nof Aethiopia and Arabia Felix. They marched near a thousand miles to\r\nthe south of the tropic; but the heat of the climate soon repelled the\r\ninvaders and protected the unwarlike natives of those sequestered\r\nregions. . . . The northern countries of Europe scarcely deserved the\r\nexpense and labour of conquest. The forests and morasses of Germany\r\nwere filled with a hardy race of barbarians, who despised life when it\r\nwas separated from freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\nNever had any words been so vivid and so beautiful\xe2\x80\x94Arabia\r\nFelix\xe2\x80\x94Aethiopia. But those were not more noble than the others, hardy\r\nbarbarians, forests, and morasses. They seemed to drive roads back to\r\nthe very beginning of the world, on either side of which the\r\npopulations of all times and countries stood in avenues, and by passing\r\ndown them all knowledge would be hers, and the book of the world turned\r\nback to the very first page. Such was her excitement at the\r\npossibilities of knowledge now opening before her that she ceased to\r\nread, and a breeze turning the page, the covers of Gibbon gently\r\nruffled and closed together. She then rose again and walked on. Slowly\r\nher mind became less confused and sought the origins of her exaltation,\r\nwhich were twofold and could be limited by an effort to the persons of\r\nMr. Hirst and Mr. Hewet. Any clear analysis of them was impossible\r\nowing to the haze of wonder in which they were enveloped. She could not\r\nreason about them as about people whose feelings went by the same rule\r\nas her own did, and her mind dwelt on them with a kind of physical\r\npleasure such as is caused by the contemplation of bright things\r\nhanging in the sun. From them all life seemed to radiate; the very\r\nwords of books were steeped in radiance. She then became haunted by a\r\nsuspicion which she was so reluctant to face that she welcomed a trip\r\nand stumble over the grass because thus her attention was dispersed,\r\nbut in a second it had collected itself again. Unconsciously she had\r\nbeen walking faster and faster, her body trying to outrun her mind; but\r\nshe was now on the summit of a little hillock of earth which rose above\r\nthe river and displayed the valley. She was no longer able to juggle\r\nwith several ideas, but must deal with the most persistent, and a kind\r\nof melancholy replaced her excitement. She sank down on to the earth\r\nclasping her knees together, and looking blankly in front of her. For\r\nsome time she observed a great yellow butterfly, which was opening and\r\nclosing its wings very slowly on a little flat stone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it to be in love?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded, after a long silence; each\r\nword as it came into being seemed to shove itself out into an unknown\r\nsea. Hypnotised by the wings of the butterfly, and awed by the\r\ndiscovery of a terrible possibility in life, she sat for some time\r\nlonger. When the butterfly flew away, she rose, and with her two books\r\nbeneath her arm returned home again, much as a soldier prepared for\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun of that same day going down, dusk was saluted as usual at the\r\nhotel by an instantaneous sparkle of electric lights. The hours between\r\ndinner and bedtime were always difficult enough to kill, and the night\r\nafter the dance they were further tarnished by the peevishness of\r\ndissipation. Certainly, in the opinion of Hirst and Hewet, who lay back\r\nin long arm-chairs in the middle of the hall, with their coffee-cups\r\nbeside them, and their cigarettes in their hands, the evening was\r\nunusually dull, the women unusually badly dressed, the men unusually\r\nfatuous. Moreover, when the mail had been distributed half an hour ago\r\nthere were no letters for either of the two young men. As every other\r\nperson, practically, had received two or three plump letters from\r\nEngland, which they were now engaged in reading, this seemed hard, and\r\nprompted Hirst to make the caustic remark that the animals had been\r\nfed. Their silence, he said, reminded him of the silence in the\r\nlion-house when each beast holds a lump of raw meat in its paws. He\r\nwent on, stimulated by this comparison, to liken some to\r\nhippopotamuses, some to canary birds, some to swine, some to parrots,\r\nand some to loathsome reptiles curled round the half-decayed bodies of\r\nsheep. The intermittent sounds\xe2\x80\x94now a cough, now a horrible wheezing or\r\nthroat-clearing, now a little patter of conversation\xe2\x80\x94were just, he\r\ndeclared, what you hear if you stand in the lion-house when the bones\r\nare being mauled. But these comparisons did not rouse Hewet, who, after\r\na careless glance round the room, fixed his eyes upon a thicket of\r\nnative spears which were so ingeniously arranged as to run their points\r\nat you whichever way you approached them. He was clearly oblivious of\r\nhis surroundings; whereupon Hirst, perceiving that Hewet\xe2\x80\x99s mind was a\r\ncomplete blank, fixed his attention more closely upon his\r\nfellow-creatures. He was too far from them, however, to hear what they\r\nwere saying, but it pleased him to construct little theories about them\r\nfrom their gestures and appearance.\r\n\r\nMrs. Thornbury had received a great many letters. She was completely\r\nengrossed in them. When she had finished a page she handed it to her\r\nhusband, or gave him the sense of what she was reading in a series of\r\nshort quotations linked together by a sound at the back of her throat.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvie writes that George has gone to Glasgow. \xe2\x80\x98He finds Mr. Chadbourne\r\nso nice to work with, and we hope to spend Christmas together, but I\r\nshould not like to move Betty and Alfred any great distance (no, quite\r\nright), though it is difficult to imagine cold weather in this heat. .\r\n. . Eleanor and Roger drove over in the new trap. . . . Eleanor\r\ncertainly looked more like herself than I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her since the winter.\r\nShe has put Baby on three bottles now, which I\xe2\x80\x99m sure is wise (I\xe2\x80\x99m sure\r\nit is too), and so gets better nights. . . . My hair still falls out. I\r\nfind it on the pillow! But I am cheered by hearing from Tottie Hall\r\nGreen. . . . Muriel is in Torquay enjoying herself greatly at dances.\r\nShe _is_ going to show her black pug after all.\xe2\x80\x99 . . . A line from\r\nHerbert\xe2\x80\x94so busy, poor fellow! Ah! Margaret says, \xe2\x80\x98Poor old Mrs.\r\nFairbank died on the eighth, quite suddenly in the conservatory, only a\r\nmaid in the house, who hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the presence of mind to lift her up,\r\nwhich they think might have saved her, but the doctor says it might\r\nhave come at any moment, and one can only feel thankful that it was in\r\nthe house and not in the street (I should think so!). The pigeons have\r\nincreased terribly, just as the rabbits did five years ago . . .\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nWhile she read her husband kept nodding his head very slightly, but\r\nvery steadily in sign of approval.\r\n\r\nNear by, Miss Allan was reading her letters too. They were not\r\naltogether pleasant, as could be seen from the slight rigidity which\r\ncame over her large fine face as she finished reading them and replaced\r\nthem neatly in their envelopes. The lines of care and responsibility on\r\nher face made her resemble an elderly man rather than a woman. The\r\nletters brought her news of the failure of last year\xe2\x80\x99s fruit crop in\r\nNew Zealand, which was a serious matter, for Hubert, her only brother,\r\nmade his living on a fruit farm, and if it failed again, of course, he\r\nwould throw up his place, come back to England, and what were they to\r\ndo with him this time? The journey out here, which meant the loss of a\r\nterm\xe2\x80\x99s work, became an extravagance and not the just and wonderful\r\nholiday due to her after fifteen years of punctual lecturing and\r\ncorrecting essays upon English literature. Emily, her sister, who was a\r\nteacher also, wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cWe ought to be prepared, though I have no doubt\r\nHubert will be more reasonable this time.\xe2\x80\x9d And then went on in her\r\nsensible way to say that she was enjoying a very jolly time in the\r\nLakes. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are looking exceedingly pretty just now. I have seldom\r\nseen the trees so forward at this time of year. We have taken our lunch\r\nout several days. Old Alice is as young as ever, and asks after every\r\none affectionately. The days pass very quickly, and term will soon be\r\nhere. Political prospects _not_ good, I think privately, but do not\r\nlike to damp Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiasm. Lloyd George has taken the Bill up,\r\nbut so have many before now, and we are where we are; but trust to find\r\nmyself mistaken. Anyhow, we have our work cut out for us. . . . Surely\r\nMeredith lacks the _human_ note one likes in W. W.?\xe2\x80\x9d she concluded, and\r\nwent on to discuss some questions of English literature which Miss\r\nAllan had raised in her last letter.\r\n\r\nAt a little distance from Miss Allan, on a seat shaded and made\r\nsemi-private by a thick clump of palm trees, Arthur and Susan were\r\nreading each other\xe2\x80\x99s letters. The big slashing manuscripts of\r\nhockey-playing young women in Wiltshire lay on Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s knee, while\r\nSusan deciphered tight little legal hands which rarely filled more than\r\na page, and always conveyed the same impression of jocular and breezy\r\ngoodwill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do hope Mr. Hutchinson will like me, Arthur,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s your loving Flo?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Arthur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlo Graves\xe2\x80\x94the girl I told you about, who was engaged to that dreadful\r\nMr. Vincent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan. \xe2\x80\x9cIs Mr. Hutchinson married?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nAlready her mind was busy with benevolent plans for her friends, or\r\nrather with one magnificent plan\xe2\x80\x94which was simple too\xe2\x80\x94they were all to\r\nget married\xe2\x80\x94at once\xe2\x80\x94directly she got back. Marriage, marriage that was\r\nthe right thing, the only thing, the solution required by every one she\r\nknew, and a great part of her meditations was spent in tracing every\r\ninstance of discomfort, loneliness, ill-health, unsatisfied ambition,\r\nrestlessness, eccentricity, taking things up and dropping them again,\r\npublic speaking, and philanthropic activity on the part of men and\r\nparticularly on the part of women to the fact that they wanted to\r\nmarry, were trying to marry, and had not succeeded in getting married.\r\nIf, as she was bound to own, these symptoms sometimes persisted after\r\nmarriage, she could only ascribe them to the unhappy law of nature\r\nwhich decreed that there was only one Arthur Venning, and only one\r\nSusan who could marry him. Her theory, of course, had the merit of\r\nbeing fully supported by her own case. She had been vaguely\r\nuncomfortable at home for two or three years now, and a voyage like\r\nthis with her selfish old aunt, who paid her fare but treated her as\r\nservant and companion in one, was typical of the kind of thing people\r\nexpected of her. Directly she became engaged, Mrs. Paley behaved with\r\ninstinctive respect, positively protested when Susan as usual knelt\r\ndown to lace her shoes, and appeared really grateful for an hour of\r\nSusan\xe2\x80\x99s company where she had been used to exact two or three as her\r\nright. She therefore foresaw a life of far greater comfort than she had\r\nbeen used to, and the change had already produced a great increase of\r\nwarmth in her feelings towards other people.\r\n\r\nIt was close on twenty years now since Mrs. Paley had been able to lace\r\nher own shoes or even to see them, the disappearance of her feet having\r\ncoincided more or less accurately with the death of her husband, a man\r\nof business, soon after which event Mrs. Paley began to grow stout. She\r\nwas a selfish, independent old woman, possessed of a considerable\r\nincome, which she spent upon the upkeep of a house that needed seven\r\nservants and a charwoman in Lancaster Gate, and another with a garden\r\nand carriage-horses in Surrey. Susan\xe2\x80\x99s engagement relieved her of the\r\none great anxiety of her life\xe2\x80\x94that her son Christopher should \xe2\x80\x9centangle\r\nhimself\xe2\x80\x9d with his cousin. Now that this familiar source of interest was\r\nremoved, she felt a little low and inclined to see more in Susan than\r\nshe used to. She had decided to give her a very handsome wedding\r\npresent, a cheque for two hundred, two hundred and fifty, or possibly,\r\nconceivably\xe2\x80\x94it depended upon the under-gardener and Huths\xe2\x80\x99 bill for\r\ndoing up the drawing-room\xe2\x80\x94three hundred pounds sterling.\r\n\r\nShe was thinking of this very question, revolving the figures, as she\r\nsat in her wheeled chair with a table spread with cards by her side.\r\nThe Patience had somehow got into a muddle, and she did not like to\r\ncall for Susan to help her, as Susan seemed to be busy with Arthur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s every right to expect a handsome present from me, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe thought, looking vaguely at the leopard on its hind legs, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nno doubt she does! Money goes a long way with every one. The young are\r\nvery selfish. If I were to die, nobody would miss me but Dakyns, and\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll be consoled by the will! However, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got no reason to\r\ncomplain. . . . I can still enjoy myself. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a burden to any-one.\r\n. . . I like a great many things a good deal, in spite of my legs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBeing slightly depressed, however, she went on to think of the only\r\npeople she had known who had not seemed to her at all selfish or fond\r\nof money, who had seemed to her somehow rather finer than the general\r\nrun; people she willingly acknowledged, who were finer than she was.\r\nThere were only two of them. One was her brother, who had been drowned\r\nbefore her eyes, the other was a girl, her greatest friend, who had\r\ndied in giving birth to her first child. These things had happened some\r\nfifty years ago.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey ought not to have died,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, they did\xe2\x80\x94and we\r\nselfish old creatures go on.\xe2\x80\x9d The tears came to her eyes; she felt a\r\ngenuine regret for them, a kind of respect for their youth and beauty,\r\nand a kind of shame for herself; but the tears did not fall; and she\r\nopened one of those innumerable novels which she used to pronounce good\r\nor bad, or pretty middling, or really wonderful. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t think how\r\npeople come to imagine such things,\xe2\x80\x9d she would say, taking off her\r\nspectacles and looking up with the old faded eyes, that were becoming\r\nringed with white.\r\n\r\nJust behind the stuffed leopard Mr. Elliot was playing chess with Mr.\r\nPepper. He was being defeated, naturally, for Mr. Pepper scarcely took\r\nhis eyes off the board, and Mr. Elliot kept leaning back in his chair\r\nand throwing out remarks to a gentleman who had only arrived the night\r\nbefore, a tall handsome man, with a head resembling the head of an\r\nintellectual ram. After a few remarks of a general nature had passed,\r\nthey were discovering that they knew some of the same people, as indeed\r\nhad been obvious from their appearance directly they saw each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh yes, old Truefit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Elliot. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has a son at Oxford. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\noften stayed with them. It\xe2\x80\x99s a lovely old Jacobean house. Some\r\nexquisite Greuzes\xe2\x80\x94one or two Dutch pictures which the old boy kept in\r\nthe cellars. Then there were stacks upon stacks of prints. Oh, the dirt\r\nin that house! He was a miser, you know. The boy married a daughter of\r\nLord Pinwells. I know them too. The collecting mania tends to run in\r\nfamilies. This chap collects buckles\xe2\x80\x94men\xe2\x80\x99s shoe-buckles they must be,\r\nin use between the years 1580 and 1660; the dates mayn\xe2\x80\x99t be right, but\r\nfact\xe2\x80\x99s as I say. Your true collector always has some unaccountable fad\r\nof that kind. On other points he\xe2\x80\x99s as level-headed as a breeder of\r\nshorthorns, which is what he happens to be. Then the Pinwells, as you\r\nprobably know, have their share of eccentricity too. Lady Maud, for\r\ninstance\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he was interrupted here by the necessity of considering his\r\nmove,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cLady Maud has a horror of cats and clergymen, and people with\r\nbig front teeth. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard her shout across a table, \xe2\x80\x98Keep your mouth\r\nshut, Miss Smith; they\xe2\x80\x99re as yellow as carrots!\xe2\x80\x99 across a table, mind\r\nyou. To me she\xe2\x80\x99s always been civility itself. She dabbles in\r\nliterature, likes to collect a few of us in her drawing-room, but\r\nmention a clergyman, a bishop even, nay, the Archbishop himself, and\r\nshe gobbles like a turkey-cock. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told it\xe2\x80\x99s a family\r\nfeud\xe2\x80\x94something to do with an ancestor in the reign of Charles the\r\nFirst. Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, suffering check after check, \xe2\x80\x9cI always like\r\nto know something of the grandmothers of our fashionable young men. In\r\nmy opinion they preserve all that we admire in the eighteenth century,\r\nwith the advantage, in the majority of cases, that they are personally\r\nclean. Not that one would insult old Lady Barborough by calling her\r\nclean. How often d\xe2\x80\x99you think, Hilda,\xe2\x80\x9d he called out to his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cher\r\nladyship takes a bath?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should hardly like to say, Hugh,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Elliot tittered, \xe2\x80\x9cbut wearing\r\npuce velvet, as she does even on the hottest August day, it somehow\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t show.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPepper, you have me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Elliot. \xe2\x80\x9cMy chess is even worse than I\r\nremembered.\xe2\x80\x9d He accepted his defeat with great equanimity, because he\r\nreally wished to talk.\r\n\r\nHe drew his chair beside Mr. Wilfrid Flushing, the newcomer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre these at all in your line?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, pointing at a case in front\r\nof them, where highly polished crosses, jewels, and bits of embroidery,\r\nthe work of the natives, were displayed to tempt visitors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShams, all of them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Flushing briefly. \xe2\x80\x9cThis rug, now, isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nat all bad.\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped and picked up a piece of the rug at their feet.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot old, of course, but the design is quite in the right tradition.\r\nAlice, lend me your brooch. See the difference between the old work and\r\nthe new.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA lady, who was reading with great concentration, unfastened her brooch\r\nand gave it to her husband without looking at him or acknowledging the\r\ntentative bow which Mr. Elliot was desirous of giving her. If she had\r\nlistened, she might have been amused by the reference to old Lady\r\nBarborough, her great-aunt, but, oblivious of her surroundings, she\r\nwent on reading.\r\n\r\nThe clock, which had been wheezing for some minutes like an old man\r\npreparing to cough, now struck nine. The sound slightly disturbed\r\ncertain somnolent merchants, government officials, and men of\r\nindependent means who were lying back in their chairs, chatting,\r\nsmoking, ruminating about their affairs, with their eyes half shut;\r\nthey raised their lids for an instant at the sound and then closed them\r\nagain. They had the appearance of crocodiles so fully gorged by their\r\nlast meal that the future of the world gives them no anxiety whatever.\r\nThe only disturbance in the placid bright room was caused by a large\r\nmoth which shot from light to light, whizzing over elaborate heads of\r\nhair, and causing several young women to raise their hands nervously\r\nand exclaim, \xe2\x80\x9cSome one ought to kill it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAbsorbed in their own thoughts, Hewet and Hirst had not spoken for a\r\nlong time.\r\n\r\nWhen the clock struck, Hirst said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the creatures begin to stir. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d He watched them raise\r\nthemselves, look about them, and settle down again. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I abhor most\r\nof all,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cis the female breast. Imagine being Venning and\r\nhaving to get into bed with Susan! But the really repulsive thing is\r\nthat they feel nothing at all\xe2\x80\x94about what I do when I have a hot bath.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re gross, they\xe2\x80\x99re absurd, they\xe2\x80\x99re utterly intolerable!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, and drawing no reply from Hewet, he proceeded to think about\r\nhimself, about science, about Cambridge, about the Bar, about Helen and\r\nwhat she thought of him, until, being very tired, he was nodding off to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Hewet woke him up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99you know what you feel, Hirst?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you in love?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hirst. He put in his eyeglass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be a fool,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll sit down and think about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst. \xe2\x80\x9cOne really ought\r\nto. If these people would only think about things, the world would be a\r\nfar better place for us all to live in. Are you trying to think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was exactly what Hewet had been doing for the last half-hour, but\r\nhe did not find Hirst sympathetic at the moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall go for a walk,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember we weren\xe2\x80\x99t in bed last night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst with a prodigious\r\nyawn.\r\n\r\nHewet rose and stretched himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to go and get a breath of air,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nAn unusual feeling had been bothering him all the evening and\r\nforbidding him to settle into any one train of thought. It was\r\nprecisely as if he had been in the middle of a talk which interested\r\nhim profoundly when some one came up and interrupted him. He could not\r\nfinish the talk, and the longer he sat there the more he wanted to\r\nfinish it. As the talk that had been interrupted was a talk with\r\nRachel, he had to ask himself why he felt this, and why he wanted to go\r\non talking to her. Hirst would merely say that he was in love with her.\r\nBut he was not in love with her. Did love begin in that way, with the\r\nwish to go on talking? No. It always began in his case with definite\r\nphysical sensations, and these were now absent, he did not even find\r\nher physically attractive. There was something, of course, unusual\r\nabout her\xe2\x80\x94she was young, inexperienced, and inquisitive, they had been\r\nmore open with each other than was usually possible. He always found\r\ngirls interesting to talk to, and surely these were good reasons why he\r\nshould wish to go on talking to her; and last night, what with the\r\ncrowd and the confusion, he had only been able to begin to talk to her.\r\nWhat was she doing now? Lying on a sofa and looking at the ceiling,\r\nperhaps. He could imagine her doing that, and Helen in an arm-chair,\r\nwith her hands on the arm of it, so\xe2\x80\x94looking ahead of her, with her\r\ngreat big eyes\xe2\x80\x94oh no, they\xe2\x80\x99d be talking, of course, about the dance.\r\nBut suppose Rachel was going away in a day or two, suppose this was the\r\nend of her visit, and her father had arrived in one of the steamers\r\nanchored in the bay,\xe2\x80\x94it was intolerable to know so little. Therefore he\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99you know what you feel, Hirst?\xe2\x80\x9d to stop himself from\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\nBut Hirst did not help him, and the other people with their aimless\r\nmovements and their unknown lives were disturbing, so that he longed\r\nfor the empty darkness. The first thing he looked for when he stepped\r\nout of the hall door was the light of the Ambroses\xe2\x80\x99 villa. When he had\r\ndefinitely decided that a certain light apart from the others higher up\r\nthe hill was their light, he was considerably reassured. There seemed\r\nto be at once a little stability in all this incoherence. Without any\r\ndefinite plan in his head, he took the turning to the right and walked\r\nthrough the town and came to the wall by the meeting of the roads,\r\nwhere he stopped. The booming of the sea was audible. The dark-blue\r\nmass of the mountains rose against the paler blue of the sky. There was\r\nno moon, but myriads of stars, and lights were anchored up and down in\r\nthe dark waves of earth all round him. He had meant to go back, but the\r\nsingle light of the Ambroses\xe2\x80\x99 villa had now become three separate\r\nlights, and he was tempted to go on. He might as well make sure that\r\nRachel was still there. Walking fast, he soon stood by the iron gate of\r\ntheir garden, and pushed it open; the outline of the house suddenly\r\nappeared sharply before his eyes, and the thin column of the verandah\r\ncutting across the palely lit gravel of the terrace. He hesitated. At\r\nthe back of the house some one was rattling cans. He approached the\r\nfront; the light on the terrace showed him that the sitting-rooms were\r\non that side. He stood as near the light as he could by the corner of\r\nthe house, the leaves of a creeper brushing his face. After a moment he\r\ncould hear a voice. The voice went on steadily; it was not talking, but\r\nfrom the continuity of the sound it was a voice reading aloud. He crept\r\na little closer; he crumpled the leaves together so as to stop their\r\nrustling about his ears. It might be Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s voice. He left the shadow\r\nand stepped into the radius of the light, and then heard a sentence\r\nspoken quite distinctly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there we lived from the year 1860 to 1895, the happiest years of\r\nmy parents\xe2\x80\x99 lives, and there in 1862 my brother Maurice was born, to\r\nthe delight of his parents, as he was destined to be the delight of all\r\nwho knew him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice quickened, and the tone became conclusive rising slightly in\r\npitch, as if these words were at the end of the chapter. Hewet drew\r\nback again into the shadow. There was a long silence. He could just\r\nhear chairs being moved inside. He had almost decided to go back, when\r\nsuddenly two figures appeared at the window, not six feet from him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was Maurice Fielding, of course, that your mother was engaged to,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Helen\xe2\x80\x99s voice. She spoke reflectively, looking out into the dark\r\ngarden, and thinking evidently as much of the look of the night as of\r\nwhat she was saying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel. Hewet\xe2\x80\x99s heart leapt, and he noticed the fact.\r\nHer voice, though low, was full of surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never knew there\xe2\x80\x99d been any one else,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel. She was clearly\r\nsurprised, but all they said was said low and inexpressively, because\r\nthey were speaking out into the cool dark night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore people were in love with her than with any one I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever known,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHelen stated. \xe2\x80\x9cShe had that power\xe2\x80\x94she enjoyed things. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeautiful, but\xe2\x80\x94I was thinking of her last night at the dance. She got\r\non with every kind of person, and then she made it all so\r\namazingly\xe2\x80\x94funny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt appeared that Helen was going back into the past, choosing her words\r\ndeliberately, comparing Theresa with the people she had known since\r\nTheresa died.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how she did it,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, and ceased, and there was\r\na long pause, in which a little owl called first here, then there, as\r\nit moved from tree to tree in the garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so like Aunt Lucy and Aunt Katie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel at last. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\nalways make out that she was very sad and very good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why, for goodness\xe2\x80\x99 sake, did they do nothing but criticize her\r\nwhen she was alive?\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen. Very gentle their voices sounded, as\r\nif they fell through the waves of the sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were to die to-morrow . . .\xe2\x80\x9d she began.\r\n\r\nThe broken sentences had an extraordinary beauty and detachment in\r\nHewet\xe2\x80\x99s ears, and a kind of mystery too, as though they were spoken by\r\npeople in their sleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen\xe2\x80\x99s voice continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to walk in the\r\ngarden; it\xe2\x80\x99s damp\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s sure to be damp; besides, I see at least a dozen\r\ntoads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToads? Those are stones, Helen. Come out. It\xe2\x80\x99s nicer out. The flowers\r\nsmell,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel replied.\r\n\r\nHewet drew still farther back. His heart was beating very quickly.\r\nApparently Rachel tried to pull Helen out on to the terrace, and Helen\r\nresisted. There was a certain amount of scuffling, entreating,\r\nresisting, and laughter from both of them. Then a man\xe2\x80\x99s form appeared.\r\nHewet could not hear what they were all saying. In a minute they had\r\ngone in; he could hear bolts grating then; there was dead silence, and\r\nall the lights went out.\r\n\r\nHe turned away, still crumpling and uncrumpling a handful of leaves\r\nwhich he had torn from the wall. An exquisite sense of pleasure and\r\nrelief possessed him; it was all so solid and peaceful after the ball\r\nat the hotel, whether he was in love with them or not, and he was not\r\nin love with them; no, but it was good that they should be alive.\r\n\r\nAfter standing still for a minute or two he turned and began to walk\r\ntowards the gate. With the movement of his body, the excitement, the\r\nromance and the richness of life crowded into his brain. He shouted out\r\na line of poetry, but the words escaped him, and he stumbled among\r\nlines and fragments of lines which had no meaning at all except for the\r\nbeauty of the words. He shut the gate, and ran swinging from side to\r\nside down the hill, shouting any nonsense that came into his head.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere am I,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried rhythmically, as his feet pounded to the left and\r\nto the right, \xe2\x80\x9cplunging along, like an elephant in the jungle,\r\nstripping the branches as I go (he snatched at the twigs of a bush at\r\nthe roadside), roaring innumerable words, lovely words about\r\ninnumerable things, running downhill and talking nonsense aloud to\r\nmyself about roads and leaves and lights and women coming out into the\r\ndarkness\xe2\x80\x94about women\xe2\x80\x94about Rachel, about Rachel.\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped and drew a\r\ndeep breath. The night seemed immense and hospitable, and although so\r\ndark there seemed to be things moving down there in the harbour and\r\nmovement out at sea. He gazed until the darkness numbed him, and then\r\nhe walked on quickly, still murmuring to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I ought to be in\r\nbed, snoring and dreaming, dreaming, dreaming. Dreams and realities,\r\ndreams and realities, dreams and realities,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated all the way up\r\nthe avenue, scarcely knowing what he said, until he reached the front\r\ndoor. Here he paused for a second, and collected himself before he\r\nopened the door.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were dazed, his hands very cold, and his brain excited and yet\r\nhalf asleep. Inside the door everything was as he had left it except\r\nthat the hall was now empty. There were the chairs turning in towards\r\neach other where people had sat talking, and the empty glasses on\r\nlittle tables, and the newspapers scattered on the floor. As he shut\r\nthe door he felt as if he were enclosed in a square box, and instantly\r\nshrivelled up. It was all very bright and very small. He stopped for a\r\nminute by the long table to find a paper which he had meant to read,\r\nbut he was still too much under the influence of the dark and the fresh\r\nair to consider carefully which paper it was or where he had seen it.\r\n\r\nAs he fumbled vaguely among the papers he saw a figure cross the tail\r\nof his eye, coming downstairs. He heard the swishing sound of skirts,\r\nand to his great surprise, Evelyn M. came up to him, laid her hand on\r\nthe table as if to prevent him from taking up a paper, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re just the person I wanted to talk to.\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice was a little\r\nunpleasant and metallic, her eyes were very bright, and she kept them\r\nfixed upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo talk to me?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m half asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I think you understand better than most people,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, and\r\nsat down on a little chair placed beside a big leather chair so that\r\nHewet had to sit down beside her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He yawned openly, and lit a cigarette. He could not\r\nbelieve that this was really happening to him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you really sympathetic, or is it just a pose?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s for you to say,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m interested, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d He still\r\nfelt numb all over and as if she was much too close to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny one can be interested!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cYour friend Mr.\r\nHirst\xe2\x80\x99s interested, I daresay however, I do believe in you. You look as\r\nif you\xe2\x80\x99d got a nice sister, somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused, picking at some\r\nsequins on her knees, and then, as if she had made up her mind, she\r\nstarted off, \xe2\x80\x9cAnyhow, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask your advice. D\xe2\x80\x99you ever get into\r\na state where you don\xe2\x80\x99t know your own mind? That\xe2\x80\x99s the state I\xe2\x80\x99m in\r\nnow. You see, last night at the dance Raymond Oliver,\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s the tall\r\ndark boy who looks as if he had Indian blood in him, but he says he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot really,\xe2\x80\x94well, we were sitting out together, and he told me all\r\nabout himself, how unhappy he is at home, and how he hates being out\r\nhere. They\xe2\x80\x99ve put him into some beastly mining business. He says it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeastly\xe2\x80\x94I should like it, I know, but that\xe2\x80\x99s neither here nor there.\r\nAnd I felt awfully sorry for him, one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help being sorry for\r\nhim, and when he asked me to let him kiss me, I did. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any\r\nharm in that, do you? And then this morning he said he\xe2\x80\x99d thought I\r\nmeant something more, and I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the sort to let any one kiss me. And\r\nwe talked and talked. I daresay I was very silly, but one can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nliking people when one\xe2\x80\x99s sorry for them. I do like him most awfully\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe paused. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I gave him half a promise, and then, you see, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nAlfred Perrott.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Perrott,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe got to know each other on that picnic the other day,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued. \xe2\x80\x9cHe seemed so lonely, especially as Arthur had gone off with\r\nSusan, and one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help guessing what was in his mind. So we had\r\nquite a long talk when you were looking at the ruins, and he told me\r\nall about his life, and his struggles, and how fearfully hard it had\r\nbeen. D\xe2\x80\x99you know, he was a boy in a grocer\xe2\x80\x99s shop and took parcels to\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s houses in a basket? That interested me awfully, because I\r\nalways say it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter how you\xe2\x80\x99re born if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the right\r\nstuff in you. And he told me about his sister who\xe2\x80\x99s paralysed, poor\r\ngirl, and one can see she\xe2\x80\x99s a great trial, though he\xe2\x80\x99s evidently very\r\ndevoted to her. I must say I do admire people like that! I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect\r\nyou do because you\xe2\x80\x99re so clever. Well, last night we sat out in the\r\ngarden together, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help seeing what he wanted to say, and\r\ncomforting him a little, and telling him I did care\xe2\x80\x94I really do\xe2\x80\x94only,\r\nthen, there\xe2\x80\x99s Raymond Oliver. What I want you to tell me is, can one be\r\nin love with two people at once, or can\xe2\x80\x99t one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe became silent, and sat with her chin on her hands, looking very\r\nintent, as if she were facing a real problem which had to be discussed\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it depends what sort of person you are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet. He looked\r\nat her. She was small and pretty, aged perhaps twenty-eight or\r\ntwenty-nine, but though dashing and sharply cut, her features expressed\r\nnothing very clearly, except a great deal of spirit and good health.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you, what are you; you see, I know nothing about you,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I was coming to that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Evelyn M. She continued to rest her\r\nchin on her hands and to look intently ahead of her. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the daughter\r\nof a mother and no father, if that interests you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\na very nice thing to be. It\xe2\x80\x99s what often happens in the country. She\r\nwas a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, and he was rather a swell\xe2\x80\x94the young man up at\r\nthe great house. He never made things straight\xe2\x80\x94never married her\xe2\x80\x94though\r\nhe allowed us quite a lot of money. His people wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let him. Poor\r\nfather! I can\xe2\x80\x99t help liking him. Mother wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the sort of woman who\r\ncould keep him straight, anyhow. He was killed in the war. I believe\r\nhis men worshipped him. They say great big troopers broke down and\r\ncried over his body on the battlefield. I wish I\xe2\x80\x99d known him. Mother\r\nhad all the life crushed out of her. The world\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She clenched her fist.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, people can be horrid to a woman like that!\xe2\x80\x9d She turned upon Hewet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cd\xe2\x80\x99you want to know any more about me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWho looked after you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve looked after myself mostly,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had splendid\r\nfriends. I do like people! That\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble. What would you do if you\r\nliked two people, both of them tremendously, and you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nwhich most?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should go on liking them\xe2\x80\x94I should wait and see. Why not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut one has to make up one\xe2\x80\x99s mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Evelyn. \xe2\x80\x9cOr are you one of\r\nthe people who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in marriages and all that? Look\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x94this isn\xe2\x80\x99t fair, I do all the telling, and you tell nothing.\r\nPerhaps you\xe2\x80\x99re the same as your friend\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she looked at him suspiciously;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cperhaps you don\xe2\x80\x99t like me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know when I like a person directly I see them! I knew I liked you\r\nthe very first night at dinner. Oh dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued impatiently,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat a lot of bother would be saved if only people would say the\r\nthings they think straight out! I\xe2\x80\x99m made like that. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you find it leads to difficulties?\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s men\xe2\x80\x99s fault,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThey always drag it in\xe2\x80\x94love, I\r\nmean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you\xe2\x80\x99ve gone on having one proposal after another,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I\xe2\x80\x99ve had more proposals than most women,\xe2\x80\x9d said Evelyn,\r\nbut she spoke without conviction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive, six, ten?\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet ventured.\r\n\r\nEvelyn seemed to intimate that perhaps ten was the right figure, but\r\nthat it really was not a high one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking me a heartless flirt,\xe2\x80\x9d she protested. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care if you are. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what any one thinks of me. Just\r\nbecause one\xe2\x80\x99s interested and likes to be friends with men, and talk to\r\nthem as one talks to women, one\xe2\x80\x99s called a flirt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Miss Murgatroyd\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d call me Evelyn,\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter ten proposals do you honestly think that men are the same as\r\nwomen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonestly, honestly,\xe2\x80\x94how I hate that word! It\xe2\x80\x99s always used by prigs,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncried Evelyn. \xe2\x80\x9cHonestly I think they ought to be. That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\ndisappointing. Every time one thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen, and\r\nevery time it does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pursuit of Friendship,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet. \xe2\x80\x9cThe title of a comedy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re horrid,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t care a bit really. You might be\r\nMr. Hirst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet, \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s consider. Let us consider\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He paused,\r\nbecause for the moment he could not remember what it was that they had\r\nto consider. He was far more interested in her than in her story, for\r\nas she went on speaking his numbness had disappeared, and he was\r\nconscious of a mixture of liking, pity, and distrust. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve promised\r\nto marry both Oliver and Perrott?\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot exactly promised,\xe2\x80\x9d said Evelyn. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t make up my mind which I\r\nreally like best. Oh how I detest modern life!\xe2\x80\x9d she flung off. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must\r\nhave been so much easier for the Elizabethans! I thought the other day\r\non that mountain how I\xe2\x80\x99d have liked to be one of those colonists, to\r\ncut down trees and make laws and all that, instead of fooling about\r\nwith all these people who think one\xe2\x80\x99s just a pretty young lady. Though\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not. I really might _do_ something.\xe2\x80\x9d She reflected in silence for a\r\nminute. Then she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid right down in my heart that Alfred Perrot _won\xe2\x80\x99t_ do. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot strong, is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t cut down a tree,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you never\r\ncared for anybody?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve cared for heaps of people, but not to marry them,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsuppose I\xe2\x80\x99m too fastidious. All my life I\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted somebody I could\r\nlook up to, somebody great and big and splendid. Most men are so\r\nsmall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you mean by splendid?\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet asked. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople are\xe2\x80\x94nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvelyn was puzzled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t care for people because of their qualities,\xe2\x80\x9d he tried to\r\nexplain. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just them that we care for,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he struck a match\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cjust\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to the flames.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see what you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree. I do know why I\r\ncare for people, and I think I\xe2\x80\x99m hardly ever wrong. I see at once what\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve got in them. Now I think you must be rather splendid; but not\r\nMr. Hirst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHewlet shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not nearly so unselfish, or so sympathetic, or so big, or so\r\nunderstanding,\xe2\x80\x9d Evelyn continued.\r\n\r\nHewet sat silent, smoking his cigarette.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should hate cutting down trees,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to flirt with you, though I suppose you think I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nEvelyn shot out. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d never have come to you if I\xe2\x80\x99d thought you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nmerely think odious things of me!\xe2\x80\x9d The tears came into her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you never flirt?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she protested. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I told you? I want\r\nfriendship; I want to care for some one greater and nobler than I am,\r\nand if they fall in love with me it isn\xe2\x80\x99t my fault; I don\xe2\x80\x99t want it; I\r\npositively hate it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHewet could see that there was very little use in going on with the\r\nconversation, for it was obvious that Evelyn did not wish to say\r\nanything in particular, but to impress upon him an image of herself,\r\nbeing, for some reason which she would not reveal, unhappy, or\r\ninsecure. He was very tired, and a pale waiter kept walking\r\nostentatiously into the middle of the room and looking at them\r\nmeaningly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey want to shut up,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy advice is that you should tell\r\nOliver and Perrott to-morrow that you\xe2\x80\x99ve made up your mind that you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mean to marry either of them. I\xe2\x80\x99m certain you don\xe2\x80\x99t. If you\r\nchange your mind you can always tell them so. They\xe2\x80\x99re both sensible\r\nmen; they\xe2\x80\x99ll understand. And then all this bother will be over.\xe2\x80\x9d He got\r\nup.\r\n\r\nBut Evelyn did not move. She sat looking up at him with her bright\r\neager eyes, in the depths of which he thought he detected some\r\ndisappointment, or dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are heaps of things I want to say to you still,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m going to, some time. I suppose you must go to bed now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m half asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d He left her still sitting by\r\nherself in the empty hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it that they _won\xe2\x80\x99t_ be honest?\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered to himself as he\r\nwent upstairs. Why was it that relations between different people were\r\nso unsatisfactory, so fragmentary, so hazardous, and words so dangerous\r\nthat the instinct to sympathise with another human being was an\r\ninstinct to be examined carefully and probably crushed? What had Evelyn\r\nreally wished to say to him? What was she feeling left alone in the\r\nempty hall? The mystery of life and the unreality even of one\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nsensations overcame him as he walked down the corridor which led to his\r\nroom. It was dimly lighted, but sufficiently for him to see a figure in\r\na bright dressing-gown pass swiftly in front of him, the figure of a\r\nwoman crossing from one room to another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether too slight or too vague the ties that bind people casually\r\nmeeting in a hotel at midnight, they possess one advantage at least\r\nover the bonds which unite the elderly, who have lived together once\r\nand so must live for ever. Slight they may be, but vivid and genuine,\r\nmerely because the power to break them is within the grasp of each, and\r\nthere is no reason for continuance except a true desire that continue\r\nthey shall. When two people have been married for years they seem to\r\nbecome unconscious of each other\xe2\x80\x99s bodily presence so that they move as\r\nif alone, speak aloud things which they do not expect to be answered,\r\nand in general seem to experience all the comfort of solitude without\r\nits loneliness. The joint lives of Ridley and Helen had arrived at this\r\nstage of community, and it was often necessary for one or the other to\r\nrecall with an effort whether a thing had been said or only thought,\r\nshared or dreamt in private. At four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon two or\r\nthree days later Mrs. Ambrose was standing brushing her hair, while her\r\nhusband was in the dressing-room which opened out of her room, and\r\noccasionally, through the cascade of water\xe2\x80\x94he was washing his face\xe2\x80\x94she\r\ncaught exclamations, \xe2\x80\x9cSo it goes on year after year; I wish, I wish, I\r\nwish I could make an end of it,\xe2\x80\x9d to which she paid no attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s white? Or only brown?\xe2\x80\x9d Thus she herself murmured, examining a\r\nhair which gleamed suspiciously among the brown. She pulled it out and\r\nlaid it on the dressing-table. She was criticising her own appearance,\r\nor rather approving of it, standing a little way back from the glass\r\nand looking at her own face with superb pride and melancholy, when her\r\nhusband appeared in the doorway in his shirt sleeves, his face half\r\nobscured by a towel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou often tell me I don\xe2\x80\x99t notice things,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me if this is a white hair, then?\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. She laid the hair\r\non his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s not a white hair on your head,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Ridley, I begin to doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed; and bowed her head under\r\nhis eyes so that he might judge, but the inspection produced only a\r\nkiss where the line of parting ran, and husband and wife then proceeded\r\nto move about the room, casually murmuring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that you were saying?\xe2\x80\x9d Helen remarked, after an interval of\r\nconversation which no third person could have understood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRachel\xe2\x80\x94you ought to keep an eye upon Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed\r\nsignificantly, and Helen, though she went on brushing her hair, looked\r\nat him. His observations were apt to be true.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung gentlemen don\xe2\x80\x99t interest themselves in young women\xe2\x80\x99s education\r\nwithout a motive,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Hirst,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHirst and Hewet, they\xe2\x80\x99re all the same to me\xe2\x80\x94all covered with spots,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe replied. \xe2\x80\x9cHe advises her to read Gibbon. Did you know that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHelen did not know that, but she would not allow herself inferior to\r\nher husband in powers of observation. She merely said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing would surprise me. Even that dreadful flying man we met at the\r\ndance\xe2\x80\x94even Mr. Dalloway\xe2\x80\x94even\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI advise you to be circumspect,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ridley. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Willoughby,\r\nremember\xe2\x80\x94Willoughby\xe2\x80\x9d; he pointed at a letter.\r\n\r\nHelen looked with a sigh at an envelope which lay upon her\r\ndressing-table. Yes, there lay Willoughby, curt, inexpressive,\r\nperpetually jocular, robbing a whole continent of mystery, enquiring\r\nafter his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s manners and morals\xe2\x80\x94hoping she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a bore, and\r\nbidding them pack her off to him on board the very next ship if she\r\nwere\xe2\x80\x94and then grateful and affectionate with suppressed emotion, and\r\nthen half a page about his own triumphs over wretched little natives\r\nwho went on strike and refused to load his ships, until he roared\r\nEnglish oaths at them, \xe2\x80\x9cpopping my head out of the window just as I\r\nwas, in my shirt sleeves. The beggars had the sense to scatter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Theresa married Willoughby,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked, turning the page with a\r\nhairpin, \xe2\x80\x9cone doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see what\xe2\x80\x99s to prevent Rachel\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Ridley was now off on grievances of his own connected with the\r\nwashing of his shirts, which somehow led to the frequent visits of\r\nHughling Elliot, who was a bore, a pedant, a dry stick of a man, and\r\nyet Ridley couldn\xe2\x80\x99t simply point at the door and tell him to go. The\r\ntruth of it was, they saw too many people. And so on and so on, more\r\nconjugal talk pattering softly and unintelligibly, until they were both\r\nready to go down to tea.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that caught Helen\xe2\x80\x99s eye as she came downstairs was a\r\ncarriage at the door, filled with skirts and feathers nodding on the\r\ntops of hats. She had only time to gain the drawing-room before two\r\nnames were oddly mispronounced by the Spanish maid, and Mrs. Thornbury\r\ncame in slightly in advance of Mrs. Wilfrid Flushing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Wilfrid Flushing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Thornbury, with a wave of her hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA friend of our common friend Mrs. Raymond Parry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Flushing shook hands energetically. She was a woman of forty\r\nperhaps, very well set up and erect, splendidly robust, though not as\r\ntall as the upright carriage of her body made her appear.\r\n\r\nShe looked Helen straight in the face and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have a charmin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had a strongly marked face, her eyes looked straight at you, and\r\nthough naturally she was imperious in her manner she was nervous at the\r\nsame time. Mrs. Thornbury acted as interpreter, making things smooth\r\nall round by a series of charming commonplace remarks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve taken it upon myself, Mr. Ambrose,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cto promise that\r\nyou will be so kind as to give Mrs. Flushing the benefit of your\r\nexperience. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure no one here knows the country as well as you do.\r\nNo one takes such wonderful long walks. No one, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, has your\r\nencyclopaedic knowledge upon every subject. Mr. Wilfrid Flushing is a\r\ncollector. He has discovered really beautiful things already. I had no\r\nnotion that the peasants were so artistic\xe2\x80\x94though of course in the\r\npast\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot old things\xe2\x80\x94new things,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Mrs. Flushing curtly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nis, if he takes my advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Ambroses had not lived for many years in London without knowing\r\nsomething of a good many people, by name at least, and Helen remembered\r\nhearing of the Flushings. Mr. Flushing was a man who kept an old\r\nfurniture shop; he had always said he would not marry because most\r\nwomen have red cheeks, and would not take a house because most houses\r\nhave narrow staircases, and would not eat meat because most animals\r\nbleed when they are killed; and then he had married an eccentric\r\naristocratic lady, who certainly was not pale, who looked as if she ate\r\nmeat, who had forced him to do all the things he most disliked\xe2\x80\x94and this\r\nthen was the lady. Helen looked at her with interest. They had moved\r\nout into the garden, where the tea was laid under a tree, and Mrs.\r\nFlushing was helping herself to cherry jam. She had a peculiar jerking\r\nmovement of the body when she spoke, which caused the canary-coloured\r\nplume on her hat to jerk too. Her small but finely-cut and vigorous\r\nfeatures, together with the deep red of lips and cheeks, pointed to\r\nmany generations of well-trained and well-nourished ancestors behind\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothin\xe2\x80\x99 that\xe2\x80\x99s more than twenty years old interests me,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued. \xe2\x80\x9cMouldy old pictures, dirty old books, they stick \xe2\x80\x99em in\r\nmuseums when they\xe2\x80\x99re only fit for burnin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite agree,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut my husband spends his life in\r\ndigging up manuscripts which nobody wants.\xe2\x80\x9d She was amused by Ridley\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexpression of startled disapproval.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a clever man in London called John who paints ever so much\r\nbetter than the old masters,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Flushing continued. \xe2\x80\x9cHis pictures\r\nexcite me\xe2\x80\x94nothin\xe2\x80\x99 that\xe2\x80\x99s old excites me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut even his pictures will become old,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Thornbury intervened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll have \xe2\x80\x99em burnt, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll put it in my will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nFlushing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mrs. Flushing lived in one of the most beautiful old houses in\r\nEngland\xe2\x80\x94Chillingley,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Thornbury explained to the rest of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99d my way I\xe2\x80\x99d burn that to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Flushing laughed. She had\r\na laugh like the cry of a jay, at once startling and joyless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does any sane person want with those great big houses?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ndemanded. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you go downstairs after dark you\xe2\x80\x99re covered with black\r\nbeetles, and the electric lights always goin\xe2\x80\x99 out. What would you do if\r\nspiders came out of the tap when you turned on the hot water?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ndemanded, fixing her eye on Helen.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ambrose shrugged her shoulders with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what I like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Flushing. She jerked her head at the\r\nVilla. \xe2\x80\x9cA little house in a garden. I had one once in Ireland. One\r\ncould lie in bed in the mornin\xe2\x80\x99 and pick roses outside the window with\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s toes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the gardeners, weren\xe2\x80\x99t they surprised?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Thornbury enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were no gardeners,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Flushing chuckled. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody but me and\r\nan old woman without any teeth. You know the poor in Ireland lose their\r\nteeth after they\xe2\x80\x99re twenty. But you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect a politician to\r\nunderstand that\xe2\x80\x94Arthur Balfour wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRidley sighed that he never expected any one to understand anything,\r\nleast of all politicians.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s one advantage I find in extreme old\r\nage\xe2\x80\x94nothing matters a hang except one\xe2\x80\x99s food and one\xe2\x80\x99s digestion. All I\r\nask is to be left alone to moulder away in solitude. It\xe2\x80\x99s obvious that\r\nthe world\xe2\x80\x99s going as fast as it can to\xe2\x80\x94the Nethermost Pit, and all I\r\ncan do is to sit still and consume as much of my own smoke as\r\npossible.\xe2\x80\x9d He groaned, and with a melancholy glance laid the jam on his\r\nbread, for he felt the atmosphere of this abrupt lady distinctly\r\nunsympathetic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always contradict my husband when he says that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Thornbury\r\nsweetly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou men! Where would you be if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for the women!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead the _Symposium_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ridley grimly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Symposium_?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Flushing. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Latin or Greek? Tell me, is\r\nthere a good translation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ridley. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will have to learn Greek.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Flushing cried, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah, ah! I\xe2\x80\x99d rather break stones in the road.\r\nI always envy the men who break stones and sit on those nice little\r\nheaps all day wearin\xe2\x80\x99 spectacles. I\xe2\x80\x99d infinitely rather break stones\r\nthan clean out poultry runs, or feed the cows, or\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Rachel came up from the lower garden with a book in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that book?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ridley, when she had shaken hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Gibbon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel as she sat down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Thornbury. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nvery wonderful book, I know. My dear father was always quoting it at\r\nus, with the result that we resolved never to read a line.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGibbon the historian?\xe2\x80\x9d enquired Mrs. Flushing. \xe2\x80\x9cI connect him with\r\nsome of the happiest hours of my life. We used to lie in bed and read\r\nGibbon\xe2\x80\x94about the massacres of the Christians, I remember\xe2\x80\x94when we were\r\nsupposed to be asleep. It\xe2\x80\x99s no joke, I can tell you, readin\xe2\x80\x99 a great\r\nbig book, in double columns, by a night-light, and the light that comes\r\nthrough a chink in the door. Then there were the moths\xe2\x80\x94tiger moths,\r\nyellow moths, and horrid cockchafers. Louisa, my sister, would have the\r\nwindow open. I wanted it shut. We fought every night of our lives over\r\nthat window. Have you ever seen a moth dyin\xe2\x80\x99 in a night-light?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nenquired.\r\n\r\nAgain there was an interruption. Hewet and Hirst appeared at the\r\ndrawing-room window and came up to the tea-table.\r\n\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s heart beat hard. She was conscious of an extraordinary\r\nintensity in everything, as though their presence stripped some cover\r\noff the surface of things; but the greetings were remarkably\r\ncommonplace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst, rising from his chair directly he had sat\r\ndown. He went into the drawing-room, and returned with a cushion which\r\nhe placed carefully upon his seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRheumatism,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, as he sat down for the second time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe result of the dance?\xe2\x80\x9d Helen enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever I get at all run down I tend to be rheumatic,\xe2\x80\x9d Hirst stated.\r\nHe bent his wrist back sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cI hear little pieces of chalk grinding\r\ntogether!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel looked at him. She was amused, and yet she was respectful; if\r\nsuch a thing could be, the upper part of her face seemed to laugh, and\r\nthe lower part to check its laughter.\r\n\r\nHewet picked up the book that lay on the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou like this?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked in an undertone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. She had indeed been trying all the\r\nafternoon to read it, and for some reason the glory which she had\r\nperceived at first had faded, and, read as she would, she could not\r\ngrasp the meaning with her mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt goes round, round, round, like a roll of oil-cloth,\xe2\x80\x9d she hazarded.\r\nEvidently she meant Hewet alone to hear her words, but Hirst demanded,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was instantly ashamed of her figure of speech, for she could not\r\nexplain it in words of sober criticism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely it\xe2\x80\x99s the most perfect style, so far as style goes, that\xe2\x80\x99s ever\r\nbeen invented,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery sentence is practically perfect,\r\nand the wit\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUgly in body, repulsive in mind,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, instead of thinking\r\nabout Gibbon\xe2\x80\x99s style. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, but strong, searching, unyielding in mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe looked at his big head, a disproportionate part of which was\r\noccupied by the forehead, and at the direct, severe eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give you up in despair,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He meant it lightly, but she took\r\nit seriously, and believed that her value as a human being was lessened\r\nbecause she did not happen to admire the style of Gibbon. The others\r\nwere talking now in a group about the native villages which Mrs.\r\nFlushing ought to visit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI despair too,\xe2\x80\x9d she said impetuously. \xe2\x80\x9cHow are you going to judge\r\npeople merely by their minds?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou agree with my spinster Aunt, I expect,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. John in his\r\njaunty manner, which was always irritating because it made the person\r\nhe talked to appear unduly clumsy and in earnest. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Be good, sweet\r\nmaid\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94I thought Mr. Kingsley and my Aunt were now obsolete.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can be very nice without having read a book,\xe2\x80\x9d she asserted. Very\r\nsilly and simple her words sounded, and laid her open to derision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I ever deny it?\xe2\x80\x9d Hirst enquired, raising his eyebrows.\r\n\r\nMost unexpectedly Mrs. Thornbury here intervened, either because it was\r\nher mission to keep things smooth or because she had long wished to\r\nspeak to Mr. Hirst, feeling as she did that young men were her sons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have lived all my life with people like your Aunt, Mr. Hirst,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, leaning forward in her chair. Her brown squirrel-like eyes became\r\neven brighter than usual. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have never heard of Gibbon. They only\r\ncare for their pheasants and their peasants. They are great big men who\r\nlook so fine on horseback, as people must have done, I think, in the\r\ndays of the great wars. Say what you like against them\xe2\x80\x94they are animal,\r\nthey are unintellectual; they don\xe2\x80\x99t read themselves, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant others to read, but they are some of the finest and the kindest\r\nhuman beings on the face of the earth! You would be surprised at some\r\nof the stories I could tell. You have never guessed, perhaps, at all\r\nthe romances that go on in the heart of the country. There are the\r\npeople, I feel, among whom Shakespeare will be born if he is ever born\r\nagain. In those old houses, up among the Downs\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d Hirst interrupted, \xe2\x80\x9cspends her life in East Lambeth among\r\nthe degraded poor. I only quoted my Aunt because she is inclined to\r\npersecute people she calls \xe2\x80\x98intellectual,\xe2\x80\x99 which is what I suspect Miss\r\nVinrace of doing. It\xe2\x80\x99s all the fashion now. If you\xe2\x80\x99re clever it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nalways taken for granted that you\xe2\x80\x99re completely without sympathy,\r\nunderstanding, affection\xe2\x80\x94all the things that really matter. Oh, you\r\nChristians! You\xe2\x80\x99re the most conceited, patronising, hypocritical set of\r\nold humbugs in the kingdom! Of course,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the first to\r\nallow your country gentlemen great merits. For one thing, they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nprobably quite frank about their passions, which we are not. My father,\r\nwho is a clergyman in Norfolk, says that there is hardly a squire in\r\nthe country who does not\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut about Gibbon?\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet interrupted. The look of nervous tension\r\nwhich had come over every face was relaxed by the interruption.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou find him monotonous, I suppose. But you know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He opened the book,\r\nand began searching for passages to read aloud, and in a little time he\r\nfound a good one which he considered suitable. But there was nothing in\r\nthe world that bored Ridley more than being read aloud to, and he was\r\nbesides scrupulously fastidious as to the dress and behaviour of\r\nladies. In the space of fifteen minutes he had decided against Mrs.\r\nFlushing on the ground that her orange plume did not suit her\r\ncomplexion, that she spoke too loud, that she crossed her legs, and\r\nfinally, when he saw her accept a cigarette that Hewet offered her, he\r\njumped up, exclaiming something about \xe2\x80\x9cbar parlours,\xe2\x80\x9d and left them.\r\nMrs. Flushing was evidently relieved by his departure. She puffed her\r\ncigarette, stuck her legs out, and examined Helen closely as to the\r\ncharacter and reputation of their common friend Mrs. Raymond Parry. By\r\na series of little strategems she drove her to define Mrs. Parry as\r\nsomewhat elderly, by no means beautiful, very much made up\xe2\x80\x94an insolent\r\nold harridan, in short, whose parties were amusing because one met odd\r\npeople; but Helen herself always pitied poor Mr. Parry, who was\r\nunderstood to be shut up downstairs with cases full of gems, while his\r\nwife enjoyed herself in the drawing-room. \xe2\x80\x9cNot that I believe what\r\npeople say against her\xe2\x80\x94although she hints, of course\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Upon which Mrs.\r\nFlushing cried out with delight:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s my first cousin! Go on\xe2\x80\x94go on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Flushing rose to go she was obviously delighted with her new\r\nacquaintances. She made three or four different plans for meeting or\r\ngoing on an expedition, or showing Helen the things they had bought, on\r\nher way to the carriage. She included them all in a vague but\r\nmagnificent invitation.\r\n\r\nAs Helen returned to the garden again, Ridley\xe2\x80\x99s words of warning came\r\ninto her head, and she hesitated a moment and looked at Rachel sitting\r\nbetween Hirst and Hewet. But she could draw no conclusions, for Hewet\r\nwas still reading Gibbon aloud, and Rachel, for all the expression she\r\nhad, might have been a shell, and his words water rubbing against her\r\nears, as water rubs a shell on the edge of a rock.\r\n\r\nHewet\xe2\x80\x99s voice was very pleasant. When he reached the end of the period\r\nHewet stopped, and no one volunteered any criticism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do adore the aristocracy!\xe2\x80\x9d Hirst exclaimed after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re so amazingly unscrupulous. None of us would dare to behave as\r\nthat woman behaves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I like about them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen as she sat down, \xe2\x80\x9cis that they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nso well put together. Naked, Mrs. Flushing would be superb. Dressed as\r\nshe dresses, it\xe2\x80\x99s absurd, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst. A shade of depression crossed his face. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never\r\nweighed more than ten stone in my life,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is ridiculous,\r\nconsidering my height, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve actually gone down in weight since we\r\ncame here. I daresay that accounts for the rheumatism.\xe2\x80\x9d Again he jerked\r\nhis wrist back sharply, so that Helen might hear the grinding of the\r\nchalk stones. She could not help smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no laughing matter for me, I assure you,\xe2\x80\x9d he protested. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s a chronic invalid, and I\xe2\x80\x99m always expecting to be told that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve got heart disease myself. Rheumatism always goes to the heart in\r\nthe end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor goodness\xe2\x80\x99 sake, Hirst,\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet protested; \xe2\x80\x9cone might think you were\r\nan old cripple of eighty. If it comes to that, I had an aunt who died\r\nof cancer myself, but I put a bold face on it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He rose and began\r\ntilting his chair backwards and forwards on its hind legs. \xe2\x80\x9cIs any one\r\nhere inclined for a walk?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a magnificent walk, up\r\nbehind the house. You come out on to a cliff and look right down into\r\nthe sea. The rocks are all red; you can see them through the water. The\r\nother day I saw a sight that fairly took my breath away\xe2\x80\x94about twenty\r\njelly-fish, semi-transparent, pink, with long streamers, floating on\r\nthe top of the waves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure they weren\xe2\x80\x99t mermaids?\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s much too hot to climb\r\nuphill.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at Helen, who showed no signs of moving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s too hot,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen decided.\r\n\r\nThere was a short silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she might have said that anyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen thought to herself as\r\nHewet and Rachel went away together, and Helen was left alone with St.\r\nJohn, to St. John\xe2\x80\x99s obvious satisfaction.\r\n\r\nHe may have been satisfied, but his usual difficulty in deciding that\r\none subject was more deserving of notice than another prevented him\r\nfrom speaking for some time. He sat staring intently at the head of a\r\ndead match, while Helen considered\xe2\x80\x94so it seemed from the expression of\r\nher eyes\xe2\x80\x94something not closely connected with the present moment.\r\n\r\nAt last St. John exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cDamn! Damn everything! Damn everybody!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded. \xe2\x80\x9cAt Cambridge there are people to talk to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt Cambridge there are people to talk to,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen echoed him,\r\nrhythmically and absent-mindedly. Then she woke up. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, have\r\nyou settled what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do\xe2\x80\x94is it to be Cambridge or the Bar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pursed his lips, but made no immediate answer, for Helen was still\r\nslightly inattentive. She had been thinking about Rachel and which of\r\nthe two young men she was likely to fall in love with, and now sitting\r\nopposite to Hirst she thought, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s ugly. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pity they\xe2\x80\x99re so\r\nugly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not include Hewet in this criticism; she was thinking of the\r\nclever, honest, interesting young men she knew, of whom Hirst was a\r\ngood example, and wondering whether it was necessary that thought and\r\nscholarship should thus maltreat their bodies, and should thus elevate\r\ntheir minds to a very high tower from which the human race appeared to\r\nthem like rats and mice squirming on the flat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the future?\xe2\x80\x9d she reflected, vaguely envisaging a race of men\r\nbecoming more and more like Hirst, and a race of women becoming more\r\nand more like Rachel. \xe2\x80\x9cOh no,\xe2\x80\x9d she concluded, glancing at him, \xe2\x80\x9cone\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t marry you. Well, then, the future of the race is in the hands\r\nof Susan and Arthur; no\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful. Of farm labourers; no\xe2\x80\x94not of\r\nthe English at all, but of Russians and Chinese.\xe2\x80\x9d This train of thought\r\ndid not satisfy her, and was interrupted by St. John, who began again:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you knew Bennett. He\xe2\x80\x99s the greatest man in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBennett?\xe2\x80\x9d she enquired. Becoming more at ease, St. John dropped the\r\nconcentrated abruptness of his manner, and explained that Bennett was a\r\nman who lived in an old windmill six miles out of Cambridge. He lived\r\nthe perfect life, according to St. John, very lonely, very simple,\r\ncaring only for the truth of things, always ready to talk, and\r\nextraordinarily modest, though his mind was of the greatest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. John, when he had done describing him,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat kind of thing makes this kind of thing rather flimsy? Did you\r\nnotice at tea how poor old Hewet had to change the conversation? How\r\nthey were all ready to pounce upon me because they thought I was going\r\nto say something improper? It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything, really. If Bennett had\r\nbeen there he\xe2\x80\x99d have said exactly what he meant to say, or he\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\ngot up and gone. But there\xe2\x80\x99s something rather bad for the character in\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94I mean if one hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got Bennett\xe2\x80\x99s character. It\xe2\x80\x99s inclined to\r\nmake one bitter. Should you say that I was bitter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHelen did not answer, and he continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I am, disgustingly bitter, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a beastly thing to be.\r\nBut the worst of me is that I\xe2\x80\x99m so envious. I envy every one. I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nendure people who do things better than I do\xe2\x80\x94perfectly absurd things\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94waiters balancing piles of plates\xe2\x80\x94even Arthur, because Susan\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nlove with him. I want people to like me, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s partly my\r\nappearance, I expect,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthough it\xe2\x80\x99s an absolute lie to\r\nsay I\xe2\x80\x99ve Jewish blood in me\xe2\x80\x94as a matter of fact we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in Norfolk,\r\nHirst of Hirstbourne Hall, for three centuries at least. It must be\r\nawfully soothing to be like you\xe2\x80\x94every one liking one at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI assure you they don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst with conviction. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place, you\xe2\x80\x99re the\r\nmost beautiful woman I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen; in the second, you have an\r\nexceptionally nice nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Hirst had looked at her instead of looking intently at his teacup he\r\nwould have seen Helen blush, partly with pleasure, partly with an\r\nimpulse of affection towards the young man who had seemed, and would\r\nseem again, so ugly and so limited. She pitied him, for she suspected\r\nthat he suffered, and she was interested in him, for many of the things\r\nhe said seemed to her true; she admired the morality of youth, and yet\r\nshe felt imprisoned. As if her instinct were to escape to something\r\nbrightly coloured and impersonal, which she could hold in her hands,\r\nshe went into the house and returned with her embroidery. But he was\r\nnot interested in her embroidery; he did not even look at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout Miss Vinrace,\xe2\x80\x9d he began,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9coh, look here, do let\xe2\x80\x99s be St. John\r\nand Helen, and Rachel and Terence\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s she like? Does she reason,\r\ndoes she feel, or is she merely a kind of footstool?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen, with great decision. From her observations at tea\r\nshe was inclined to doubt whether Hirst was the person to educate\r\nRachel. She had gradually come to be interested in her niece, and fond\r\nof her; she disliked some things about her very much, she was amused by\r\nothers; but she felt her, on the whole, a live if unformed human being,\r\nexperimental, and not always fortunate in her experiments, but with\r\npowers of some kind, and a capacity for feeling. Somewhere in the\r\ndepths of her, too, she was bound to Rachel by the indestructible if\r\ninexplicable ties of sex. \xe2\x80\x9cShe seems vague, but she\xe2\x80\x99s a will of her\r\nown,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as if in the interval she had run through her\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nThe embroidery, which was a matter for thought, the design being\r\ndifficult and the colours wanting consideration, brought lapses into\r\nthe dialogue when she seemed to be engrossed in her skeins of silk, or,\r\nwith head a little drawn back and eyes narrowed, considered the effect\r\nof the whole. Thus she merely said, \xe2\x80\x9cUm-m-m\xe2\x80\x9d to St. John\xe2\x80\x99s next remark,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall ask her to go for a walk with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerhaps he resented this division of attention. He sat silent watching\r\nHelen closely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely happy,\xe2\x80\x9d he proclaimed at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d Helen enquired, sticking in her needle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarriage, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen, gently drawing her needle out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChildren?\xe2\x80\x9d St. John enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen, sticking her needle in again. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nhappy,\xe2\x80\x9d she suddenly laughed, looking him full in the face. There was a\r\nconsiderable pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s an abyss between us,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. John. His voice sounded as if\r\nit issued from the depths of a cavern in the rocks. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re infinitely\r\nsimpler than I am. Women always are, of course. That\xe2\x80\x99s the difficulty.\r\nOne never knows how a woman gets there. Supposing all the time you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nthinking, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, what a morbid young man!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHelen sat and looked at him with her needle in her hand. From her\r\nposition she saw his head in front of the dark pyramid of a\r\nmagnolia-tree. With one foot raised on the rung of a chair, and her\r\nelbow out in the attitude for sewing, her own figure possessed the\r\nsublimity of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s of the early world, spinning the thread of\r\nfate\xe2\x80\x94the sublimity possessed by many women of the present day who fall\r\ninto the attitude required by scrubbing or sewing. St. John looked at\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ve never paid any a compliment in the course of your\r\nlife,\xe2\x80\x9d he said irrelevantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI spoil Ridley rather,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen considered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask you point blank\xe2\x80\x94do you like me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a certain pause, she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s one mercy. You see,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued\r\nwith emotion, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather you liked me than any one I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever met.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about the five philosophers?\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen, with a laugh, stitching\r\nfirmly and swiftly at her canvas. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d describe them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHirst had no particular wish to describe them, but when he began to\r\nconsider them he found himself soothed and strengthened. Far away on\r\nthe other side of the world as they were, in smoky rooms, and grey\r\nmedieval courts, they appeared remarkable figures, free-spoken men with\r\nwhom one could be at ease; incomparably more subtle in emotion than the\r\npeople here. They gave him, certainly, what no woman could give him,\r\nnot Helen even. Warming at the thought of them, he went on to lay his\r\ncase before Mrs. Ambrose. Should he stay on at Cambridge or should he\r\ngo to the Bar? One day he thought one thing, another day another. Helen\r\nlistened attentively. At last, without any preface, she pronounced her\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave Cambridge and go to the Bar,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. He pressed her for her\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99d enjoy London more,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. It did not seem a very\r\nsubtle reason, but she appeared to think it sufficient. She looked at\r\nhim against the background of flowering magnolia. There was something\r\ncurious in the sight. Perhaps it was that the heavy wax-like flowers\r\nwere so smooth and inarticulate, and his face\xe2\x80\x94he had thrown his hat\r\naway, his hair was rumpled, he held his eye-glasses in his hand, so\r\nthat a red mark appeared on either side of his nose\xe2\x80\x94was so worried and\r\ngarrulous. It was a beautiful bush, spreading very widely, and all the\r\ntime she had sat there talking she had been noticing the patches of\r\nshade and the shape of the leaves, and the way the great white flowers\r\nsat in the midst of the green. She had noticed it half-consciously,\r\nnevertheless the pattern had become part of their talk. She laid down\r\nher sewing, and began to walk up and down the garden, and Hirst rose\r\ntoo and paced by her side. He was rather disturbed, uncomfortable, and\r\nfull of thought. Neither of them spoke.\r\n\r\nThe sun was beginning to go down, and a change had come over the\r\nmountains, as if they were robbed of their earthly substance, and\r\ncomposed merely of intense blue mist. Long thin clouds of flamingo red,\r\nwith edges like the edges of curled ostrich feathers, lay up and down\r\nthe sky at different altitudes. The roofs of the town seemed to have\r\nsunk lower than usual; the cypresses appeared very black between the\r\nroofs, and the roofs themselves were brown and white. As usual in the\r\nevening, single cries and single bells became audible rising from\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\nSt. John stopped suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you must take the responsibility,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve made up my\r\nmind; I shall go to the Bar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis words were very serious, almost emotional; they recalled Helen\r\nafter a second\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re right,\xe2\x80\x9d she said warmly, and shook the hand he held\r\nout. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be a great man, I\xe2\x80\x99m certain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, as if to make him look at the scene, she swept her hand round the\r\nimmense circumference of the view. From the sea, over the roofs of the\r\ntown, across the crests of the mountains, over the river and the plain,\r\nand again across the crests of the mountains it swept until it reached\r\nthe villa, the garden, the magnolia-tree, and the figures of Hirst and\r\nherself standing together, when it dropped to her side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nHewet and Rachel had long ago reached the particular place on the edge\r\nof the cliff where, looking down into the sea, you might chance on\r\njelly-fish and dolphins. Looking the other way, the vast expanse of\r\nland gave them a sensation which is given by no view, however extended,\r\nin England; the villages and the hills there having names, and the\r\nfarthest horizon of hills as often as not dipping and showing a line of\r\nmist which is the sea; here the view was one of infinite sun-dried\r\nearth, earth pointed in pinnacles, heaped in vast barriers, earth\r\nwidening and spreading away and away like the immense floor of the sea,\r\nearth chequered by day and by night, and partitioned into different\r\nlands, where famous cities were founded, and the races of men changed\r\nfrom dark savages to white civilised men, and back to dark savages\r\nagain. Perhaps their English blood made this prospect uncomfortably\r\nimpersonal and hostile to them, for having once turned their faces that\r\nway they next turned them to the sea, and for the rest of the time sat\r\nlooking at the sea. The sea, though it was a thin and sparkling water\r\nhere, which seemed incapable of surge or anger, eventually narrowed\r\nitself, clouded its pure tint with grey, and swirled through narrow\r\nchannels and dashed in a shiver of broken waters against massive\r\ngranite rocks. It was this sea that flowed up to the mouth of the\r\nThames; and the Thames washed the roots of the city of London.\r\n\r\nHewet\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts had followed some such course as this, for the first\r\nthing he said as they stood on the edge of the cliff was\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to be in England!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel lay down on her elbow, and parted the tall grasses which grew on\r\nthe edge, so that she might have a clear view. The water was very calm;\r\nrocking up and down at the base of the cliff, and so clear that one\r\ncould see the red of the stones at the bottom of it. So it had been at\r\nthe birth of the world, and so it had remained ever since. Probably no\r\nhuman being had ever broken that water with boat or with body. Obeying\r\nsome impulse, she determined to mar that eternity of peace, and threw\r\nthe largest pebble she could find. It struck the water, and the ripples\r\nspread out and out. Hewet looked down too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as they widened and ceased. The freshness\r\nand the newness seemed to him wonderful. He threw a pebble next. There\r\nwas scarcely any sound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut England,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel murmured in the absorbed tone of one whose eyes\r\nare concentrated upon some sight. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you want with England?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friends chiefly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand all the things one does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could look at Rachel without her noticing it. She was still absorbed\r\nin the water and the exquisitely pleasant sensations which a little\r\ndepth of the sea washing over rocks suggests. He noticed that she was\r\nwearing a dress of deep blue colour, made of a soft thin cotton stuff,\r\nwhich clung to the shape of her body. It was a body with the angles and\r\nhollows of a young woman\xe2\x80\x99s body not yet developed, but in no way\r\ndistorted, and thus interesting and even lovable. Raising his eyes\r\nHewet observed her head; she had taken her hat off, and the face rested\r\non her hand. As she looked down into the sea, her lips were slightly\r\nparted. The expression was one of childlike intentness, as if she were\r\nwatching for a fish to swim past over the clear red rocks. Nevertheless\r\nher twenty-four years of life had given her a look of reserve. Her\r\nhand, which lay on the ground, the fingers curling slightly in, was\r\nwell shaped and competent; the square-tipped and nervous fingers were\r\nthe fingers of a musician. With something like anguish Hewet realised\r\nthat, far from being unattractive, her body was very attractive to him.\r\nShe looked up suddenly. Her eyes were full of eagerness and interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou write novels?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nFor the moment he could not think what he was saying. He was overcome\r\nwith the desire to hold her in his arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is, I want to write them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe would not take her large grey eyes off his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNovels,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you write novels? You ought to write\r\nmusic. Music, you see\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she shifted her eyes, and became less desirable\r\nas her brain began to work, inflicting a certain change upon her\r\nface\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmusic goes straight for things. It says all there is to say at\r\nonce. With writing it seems to me there\xe2\x80\x99s so much\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she paused for an\r\nexpression, and rubbed her fingers in the earth\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cscratching on the\r\nmatchbox. Most of the time when I was reading Gibbon this afternoon I\r\nwas horribly, oh infernally, damnably bored!\xe2\x80\x9d She gave a shake of\r\nlaughter, looking at Hewet, who laughed too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ shan\xe2\x80\x99t lend you books,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I can laugh at Mr. Hirst to you,\r\nbut not to his face? At tea I was completely overwhelmed, not by his\r\nugliness\xe2\x80\x94by his mind.\xe2\x80\x9d She enclosed a circle in the air with her hands.\r\nShe realised with a great sense of comfort how easily she could talk to\r\nHewet, those thorns or ragged corners which tear the surface of some\r\nrelationships being smoothed away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I observed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a thing that never ceases to amaze\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d He had recovered his composure to such an extent that he could\r\nlight and smoke a cigarette, and feeling her ease, became happy and\r\neasy himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe respect that women, even well-educated, very able women, have for\r\nmen,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe we must have the sort of power over you\r\nthat we\xe2\x80\x99re said to have over horses. They see us three times as big as\r\nwe are or they\xe2\x80\x99d never obey us. For that very reason, I\xe2\x80\x99m inclined to\r\ndoubt that you\xe2\x80\x99ll ever do anything even when you have the vote.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nlooked at her reflectively. She appeared very smooth and sensitive and\r\nyoung. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll take at least six generations before you\xe2\x80\x99re sufficiently\r\nthick-skinned to go into law courts and business offices. Consider what\r\na bully the ordinary man is,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthe ordinary hard-working,\r\nrather ambitious solicitor or man of business with a family to bring up\r\nand a certain position to maintain. And then, of course, the daughters\r\nhave to give way to the sons; the sons have to be educated; they have\r\nto bully and shove for their wives and families, and so it all comes\r\nover again. And meanwhile there are the women in the background. . . .\r\nDo you really think that the vote will do you any good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe vote?\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel repeated. She had to visualise it as a little bit of\r\npaper which she dropped into a box before she understood his question,\r\nand looking at each other they smiled at something absurd in the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I play the piano. . . . Are men really like\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, returning to the question that interested her. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nnot afraid of you.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at him easily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m different,\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got between six and seven\r\nhundred a year of my own. And then no one takes a novelist seriously,\r\nthank heavens. There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt it helps to make up for the drudgery of\r\na profession if a man\xe2\x80\x99s taken very, very seriously by every one\xe2\x80\x94if he\r\ngets appointments, and has offices and a title, and lots of letters\r\nafter his name, and bits of ribbon and degrees. I don\xe2\x80\x99t grudge it \xe2\x80\x99em,\r\nthough sometimes it comes over me\xe2\x80\x94what an amazing concoction! What a\r\nmiracle the masculine conception of life is\xe2\x80\x94judges, civil servants,\r\narmy, navy, Houses of Parliament, lord mayors\xe2\x80\x94what a world we\xe2\x80\x99ve made\r\nof it! Look at Hirst now. I assure you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cnot a day\xe2\x80\x99s passed\r\nsince we came here without a discussion as to whether he\xe2\x80\x99s to stay on\r\nat Cambridge or to go to the Bar. It\xe2\x80\x99s his career\xe2\x80\x94his sacred career.\r\nAnd if I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it twenty times, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure his mother and sister have\r\nheard it five hundred times. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you imagine the family conclaves,\r\nand the sister told to run out and feed the rabbits because St. John\r\nmust have the school-room to himself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98St. John\xe2\x80\x99s working,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98St. John\r\nwants his tea brought to him.\xe2\x80\x99 Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know the kind of thing? No\r\nwonder that St. John thinks it a matter of considerable importance. It\r\nis too. He has to earn his living. But St. John\xe2\x80\x99s sister\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet puffed\r\nin silence. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one takes her seriously, poor dear. She feeds the\r\nrabbits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve fed rabbits for twenty-four years; it seems\r\nodd now.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked meditative, and Hewet, who had been talking much\r\nat random and instinctively adopting the feminine point of view, saw\r\nthat she would now talk about herself, which was what he wanted, for so\r\nthey might come to know each other.\r\n\r\nShe looked back meditatively upon her past life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you spend your day?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nShe meditated still. When she thought of their day it seemed to her it\r\nwas cut into four pieces by their meals. These divisions were\r\nabsolutely rigid, the contents of the day having to accommodate\r\nthemselves within the four rigid bars. Looking back at her life, that\r\nwas what she saw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBreakfast nine; luncheon one; tea five; dinner eight,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat d\xe2\x80\x99you do in the morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI need to play the piano for hours and hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd after luncheon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I went shopping with one of my aunts. Or we went to see some one,\r\nor we took a message; or we did something that had to be done\xe2\x80\x94the taps\r\nmight be leaking. They visit the poor a good deal\xe2\x80\x94old char-women with\r\nbad legs, women who want tickets for hospitals. Or I used to walk in\r\nthe park by myself. And after tea people sometimes called; or in summer\r\nwe sat in the garden or played croquet; in winter I read aloud, while\r\nthey worked; after dinner I played the piano and they wrote letters. If\r\nfather was at home we had friends of his to dinner, and about once a\r\nmonth we went up to the play. Every now and then we dined out;\r\nsometimes I went to a dance in London, but that was difficult because\r\nof getting back. The people we saw were old family friends, and\r\nrelations, but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t see many people. There was the clergyman, Mr.\r\nPepper, and the Hunts. Father generally wanted to be quiet when he came\r\nhome, because he works very hard at Hull. Also my aunts aren\xe2\x80\x99t very\r\nstrong. A house takes up a lot of time if you do it properly. Our\r\nservants were always bad, and so Aunt Lucy used to do a good deal in\r\nthe kitchen, and Aunt Clara, I think, spent most of the morning dusting\r\nthe drawing-room and going through the linen and silver. Then there\r\nwere the dogs. They had to be exercised, besides being washed and\r\nbrushed. Now Sandy\xe2\x80\x99s dead, but Aunt Clara has a very old cockatoo that\r\ncame from India. Everything in our house,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9ccomes from\r\nsomewhere! It\xe2\x80\x99s full of old furniture, not really old, Victorian,\r\nthings mother\xe2\x80\x99s family had or father\xe2\x80\x99s family had, which they didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike to get rid of, I suppose, though we\xe2\x80\x99ve really no room for them.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s rather a nice house,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept that it\xe2\x80\x99s a little\r\ndingy\xe2\x80\x94dull I should say.\xe2\x80\x9d She called up before her eyes a vision of the\r\ndrawing-room at home; it was a large oblong room, with a square window\r\nopening on the garden. Green plush chairs stood against the wall; there\r\nwas a heavy carved book-case, with glass doors, and a general\r\nimpression of faded sofa covers, large spaces of pale green, and\r\nbaskets with pieces of wool-work dropping out of them. Photographs from\r\nold Italian masterpieces hung on the walls, and views of Venetian\r\nbridges and Swedish waterfalls which members of the family had seen\r\nyears ago. There were also one or two portraits of fathers and\r\ngrandmothers, and an engraving of John Stuart Mill, after the picture\r\nby Watts. It was a room without definite character, being neither\r\ntypically and openly hideous, nor strenuously artistic, nor really\r\ncomfortable. Rachel roused herself from the contemplation of this\r\nfamiliar picture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this isn\xe2\x80\x99t very interesting for you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never been so much interested in my\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d She then realised that while she had been thinking of Richmond,\r\nhis eyes had never left her face. The knowledge of this excited her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, please go on,\xe2\x80\x9d he urged. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s imagine it\xe2\x80\x99s a Wednesday.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re all at luncheon. You sit there, and Aunt Lucy there, and Aunt\r\nClara here\xe2\x80\x9d; he arranged three pebbles on the grass between them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt Clara carves the neck of lamb,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel continued. She fixed her\r\ngaze upon the pebbles. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a very ugly yellow china stand in front\r\nof me, called a dumb waiter, on which are three dishes, one for\r\nbiscuits, one for butter, and one for cheese. There\xe2\x80\x99s a pot of ferns.\r\nThen there\xe2\x80\x99s Blanche the maid, who snuffles because of her nose. We\r\ntalk\xe2\x80\x94oh yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s Aunt Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s afternoon at Walworth, so we\xe2\x80\x99re rather\r\nquick over luncheon. She goes off. She has a purple bag, and a black\r\nnotebook. Aunt Clara has what they call a G.F.S. meeting in the\r\ndrawing-room on Wednesday, so I take the dogs out. I go up Richmond\r\nHill, along the terrace, into the park. It\xe2\x80\x99s the 18th of April\xe2\x80\x94the same\r\nday as it is here. It\xe2\x80\x99s spring in England. The ground is rather damp.\r\nHowever, I cross the road and get on to the grass and we walk along,\r\nand I sing as I always do when I\xe2\x80\x99m alone, until we come to the open\r\nplace where you can see the whole of London beneath you on a clear day.\r\nHampstead Church spire there, Westminster Cathedral over there, and\r\nfactory chimneys about here. There\xe2\x80\x99s generally a haze over the low\r\nparts of London; but it\xe2\x80\x99s often blue over the park when London\xe2\x80\x99s in a\r\nmist. It\xe2\x80\x99s the open place that the balloons cross going over to\r\nHurlingham. They\xe2\x80\x99re pale yellow. Well, then, it smells very good,\r\nparticularly if they happen to be burning wood in the keeper\xe2\x80\x99s lodge\r\nwhich is there. I could tell you now how to get from place to place,\r\nand exactly what trees you\xe2\x80\x99d pass, and where you\xe2\x80\x99d cross the roads. You\r\nsee, I played there when I was small. Spring is good, but it\xe2\x80\x99s best in\r\nthe autumn when the deer are barking; then it gets dusky, and I go back\r\nthrough the streets, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t see people properly; they come past\r\nvery quick, you just see their faces and then they\xe2\x80\x99re gone\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nI like\xe2\x80\x94and no one knows in the least what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have to be back for tea, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet checked her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTea? Oh yes. Five o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Then I say what I\xe2\x80\x99ve done, and my aunts say\r\nwhat they\xe2\x80\x99ve done, and perhaps some one comes in: Mrs. Hunt, let\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuppose. She\xe2\x80\x99s an old lady with a lame leg. She has or she once had\r\neight children; so we ask after them. They\xe2\x80\x99re all over the world; so we\r\nask where they are, and sometimes they\xe2\x80\x99re ill, or they\xe2\x80\x99re stationed in\r\na cholera district, or in some place where it only rains once in five\r\nmonths. Mrs. Hunt,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9chad a son who was hugged to\r\ndeath by a bear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere she stopped and looked at Hewet to see whether he was amused by\r\nthe same things that amused her. She was reassured. But she thought it\r\nnecessary to apologise again; she had been talking too much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t conceive how it interests me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Indeed, his\r\ncigarette had gone out, and he had to light another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy does it interest you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPartly because you\xe2\x80\x99re a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. When he said this, Rachel,\r\nwho had become oblivious of anything, and had reverted to a childlike\r\nstate of interest and pleasure, lost her freedom and became\r\nself-conscious. She felt herself at once singular and under\r\nobservation, as she felt with St. John Hirst. She was about to launch\r\ninto an argument which would have made them both feel bitterly against\r\neach other, and to define sensations which had no such importance as\r\nwords were bound to give them when Hewet led her thoughts in a\r\ndifferent direction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve often walked along the streets where people live all in a row,\r\nand one house is exactly like another house, and wondered what on earth\r\nthe women were doing inside,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cJust consider: it\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nbeginning of the twentieth century, and until a few years ago no woman\r\nhad ever come out by herself and said things at all. There it was going\r\non in the background, for all those thousands of years, this curious\r\nsilent unrepresented life. Of course we\xe2\x80\x99re always writing about\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x94abusing them, or jeering at them, or worshipping them; but it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnever come from women themselves. I believe we still don\xe2\x80\x99t know in the\r\nleast how they live, or what they feel, or what they do precisely. If\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s a man, the only confidences one gets are from young women about\r\ntheir love affairs. But the lives of women of forty, of unmarried\r\nwomen, of working women, of women who keep shops and bring up children,\r\nof women like your aunts or Mrs. Thornbury or Miss Allan\xe2\x80\x94one knows\r\nnothing whatever about them. They won\xe2\x80\x99t tell you. Either they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nafraid, or they\xe2\x80\x99ve got a way of treating men. It\xe2\x80\x99s the man\xe2\x80\x99s view\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s represented, you see. Think of a railway train: fifteen\r\ncarriages for men who want to smoke. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it make your blood boil?\r\nIf I were a woman I\xe2\x80\x99d blow some one\xe2\x80\x99s brains out. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you laugh at us\r\na great deal? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it all a great humbug? You, I mean\xe2\x80\x94how\r\ndoes it all strike you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis determination to know, while it gave meaning to their talk,\r\nhampered her; he seemed to press further and further, and made it\r\nappear so important. She took some time to answer, and during that time\r\nshe went over and over the course of her twenty-four years, lighting\r\nnow on one point, now on another\xe2\x80\x94on her aunts, her mother, her father,\r\nand at last her mind fixed upon her aunts and her father, and she tried\r\nto describe them as at this distance they appeared to her.\r\n\r\nThey were very much afraid of her father. He was a great dim force in\r\nthe house, by means of which they held on to the great world which is\r\nrepresented every morning in the _Times_. But the real life of the\r\nhouse was something quite different from this. It went on independently\r\nof Mr. Vinrace, and tended to hide itself from him. He was\r\ngood-humoured towards them, but contemptuous. She had always taken it\r\nfor granted that his point of view was just, and founded upon an ideal\r\nscale of things where the life of one person was absolutely more\r\nimportant than the life of another, and that in that scale they were of\r\nmuch less importance than he was. But did she really believe that?\r\nHewet\xe2\x80\x99s words made her think. She always submitted to her father, just\r\nas they did, but it was her aunts who influenced her really; her aunts\r\nwho built up the fine, closely woven substance of their life at home.\r\nThey were less splendid but more natural than her father was. All her\r\nrages had been against them; it was their world with its four meals,\r\nits punctuality, and servants on the stairs at half-past ten, that she\r\nexamined so closely and wanted so vehemently to smash to atoms.\r\nFollowing these thoughts she looked up and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s a sort of beauty in it\xe2\x80\x94there they are at Richmond at this\r\nvery moment building things up. They\xe2\x80\x99re all wrong, perhaps, but there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na sort of beauty in it,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so unconscious, so modest.\r\nAnd yet they feel things. They do mind if people die. Old spinsters are\r\nalways doing things. I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite know what they do. Only that was\r\nwhat I felt when I lived with them. It was very real.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe reviewed their little journeys to and fro, to Walworth, to\r\ncharwomen with bad legs, to meetings for this and that, their minute\r\nacts of charity and unselfishness which flowered punctually from a\r\ndefinite view of what they ought to do, their friendships, their tastes\r\nand habits; she saw all these things like grains of sand falling,\r\nfalling through innumerable days, making an atmosphere and building up\r\na solid mass, a background. Hewet observed her as she considered this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you happy?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\nAgain she had become absorbed in something else, and he called her back\r\nto an unusually vivid consciousness of herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was both,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI was happy and I was miserable. You\xe2\x80\x99ve no\r\nconception what it\xe2\x80\x99s like\xe2\x80\x94to be a young woman.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked straight at\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are terrors and agonies,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, keeping her eye on him\r\nas if to detect the slightest hint of laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He returned her look with perfect\r\nsincerity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen one sees in the streets,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProstitutes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMen kissing one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were never told?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then,\xe2\x80\x9d she began and stopped. Here came in the great space of life\r\ninto which no one had ever penetrated. All that she had been saying\r\nabout her father and her aunts and walks in Richmond Park, and what\r\nthey did from hour to hour, was merely on the surface. Hewet was\r\nwatching her. Did he demand that she should describe that also? Why did\r\nhe sit so near and keep his eye on her? Why did they not have done with\r\nthis searching and agony? Why did they not kiss each other simply? She\r\nwished to kiss him. But all the time she went on spinning out words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA girl is more lonely than a boy. No one cares in the least what she\r\ndoes. Nothing\xe2\x80\x99s expected of her. Unless one\xe2\x80\x99s very pretty people don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlisten to what you say. . . . And that is what I like,\xe2\x80\x9d she added\r\nenergetically, as if the memory were very happy. \xe2\x80\x9cI like walking in\r\nRichmond Park and singing to myself and knowing it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter a\r\ndamn to anybody. I like seeing things go on\xe2\x80\x94as we saw you that night\r\nwhen you didn\xe2\x80\x99t see us\xe2\x80\x94I love the freedom of it\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s like being the\r\nwind or the sea.\xe2\x80\x9d She turned with a curious fling of her hands and\r\nlooked at the sea. It was still very blue, dancing away as far as the\r\neye could reach, but the light on it was yellower, and the clouds were\r\nturning flamingo red.\r\n\r\nA feeling of intense depression crossed Hewet\xe2\x80\x99s mind as she spoke. It\r\nseemed plain that she would never care for one person rather than\r\nanother; she was evidently quite indifferent to him; they seemed to\r\ncome very near, and then they were as far apart as ever again; and her\r\ngesture as she turned away had been oddly beautiful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d he said abruptly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou like people. You like admiration.\r\nYour real grudge against Hirst is that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t admire you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made no answer for some time. Then she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s probably true. Of course I like people\xe2\x80\x94I like almost every one\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve ever met.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned her back on the sea and regarded Hewet with friendly if\r\ncritical eyes. He was good-looking in the sense that he had always had\r\na sufficiency of beef to eat and fresh air to breathe. His head was\r\nbig; the eyes were also large; though generally vague they could be\r\nforcible; and the lips were sensitive. One might account him a man of\r\nconsiderable passion and fitful energy, likely to be at the mercy of\r\nmoods which had little relation to facts; at once tolerant and\r\nfastidious. The breadth of his forehead showed capacity for thought.\r\nThe interest with which Rachel looked at him was heard in her voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat novels do you write?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to write a novel about Silence,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cthe things people\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t say. But the difficulty is immense.\xe2\x80\x9d He sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. He looked at her almost severely. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody\r\ncares. All you read a novel for is to see what sort of person the\r\nwriter is, and, if you know him, which of his friends he\xe2\x80\x99s put in. As\r\nfor the novel itself, the whole conception, the way one\xe2\x80\x99s seen the\r\nthing, felt about it, make it stand in relation to other things, not\r\none in a million cares for that. And yet I sometimes wonder whether\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s anything else in the whole world worth doing. These other\r\npeople,\xe2\x80\x9d he indicated the hotel, \xe2\x80\x9care always wanting something they\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t get. But there\xe2\x80\x99s an extraordinary satisfaction in writing, even\r\nin the attempt to write. What you said just now is true: one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant to be things; one wants merely to be allowed to see them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome of the satisfaction of which he spoke came into his face as he\r\ngazed out to sea.\r\n\r\nIt was Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s turn now to feel depressed. As he talked of writing he\r\nhad become suddenly impersonal. He might never care for any one; all\r\nthat desire to know her and get at her, which she had felt pressing on\r\nher almost painfully, had completely vanished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you a good writer?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not first-rate, of course; I\xe2\x80\x99m good second-rate;\r\nabout as good as Thackeray, I should say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel was amazed. For one thing it amazed her to hear Thackeray called\r\nsecond-rate; and then she could not widen her point of view to believe\r\nthat there could be great writers in existence at the present day, or\r\nif there were, that any one she knew could be a great writer, and his\r\nself-confidence astounded her, and he became more and more remote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy other novel,\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet continued, \xe2\x80\x9cis about a young man who is\r\nobsessed by an idea\xe2\x80\x94the idea of being a gentleman. He manages to exist\r\nat Cambridge on a hundred pounds a year. He has a coat; it was once a\r\nvery good coat. But the trousers\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re not so good. Well, he goes up\r\nto London, gets into good society, owing to an early-morning adventure\r\non the banks of the Serpentine. He is led into telling lies\xe2\x80\x94my idea,\r\nyou see, is to show the gradual corruption of the soul\xe2\x80\x94calls himself\r\nthe son of some great landed proprietor in Devonshire. Meanwhile the\r\ncoat becomes older and older, and he hardly dares to wear the trousers.\r\nCan\xe2\x80\x99t you imagine the wretched man, after some splendid evening of\r\ndebauchery, contemplating these garments\xe2\x80\x94hanging them over the end of\r\nthe bed, arranging them now in full light, now in shade, and wondering\r\nwhether they will survive him, or he will survive them? Thoughts of\r\nsuicide cross his mind. He has a friend, too, a man who somehow\r\nsubsists upon selling small birds, for which he sets traps in the\r\nfields near Uxbridge. They\xe2\x80\x99re scholars, both of them. I know one or two\r\nwretched starving creatures like that who quote Aristotle at you over a\r\nfried herring and a pint of porter. Fashionable life, too, I have to\r\nrepresent at some length, in order to show my hero under all\r\ncircumstances. Lady Theo Bingham Bingley, whose bay mare he had the\r\ngood fortune to stop, is the daughter of a very fine old Tory peer. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing to describe the kind of parties I once went to\xe2\x80\x94the fashionable\r\nintellectuals, you know, who like to have the latest book on their\r\ntables. They give parties, river parties, parties where you play games.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no difficulty in conceiving incidents; the difficulty is to put\r\nthem into shape\xe2\x80\x94not to get run away with, as Lady Theo was. It ended\r\ndisastrously for her, poor woman, for the book, as I planned it, was\r\ngoing to end in profound and sordid respectability. Disowned by her\r\nfather, she marries my hero, and they live in a snug little villa\r\noutside Croydon, in which town he is set up as a house agent. He never\r\nsucceeds in becoming a real gentleman after all. That\xe2\x80\x99s the interesting\r\npart of it. Does it seem to you the kind of book you\xe2\x80\x99d like to read?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe enquired; \xe2\x80\x9cor perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d like my Stuart tragedy better,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, without waiting for her to answer him. \xe2\x80\x9cMy idea is that\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a certain quality of beauty in the past, which the ordinary\r\nhistorical novelist completely ruins by his absurd conventions. The\r\nmoon becomes the Regent of the Skies. People clap spurs to their\r\nhorses, and so on. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to treat people as though they were\r\nexactly the same as we are. The advantage is that, detached from modern\r\nconditions, one can make them more intense and more abstract than\r\npeople who live as we do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel had listened to all this with attention, but with a certain\r\namount of bewilderment. They both sat thinking their own thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not like Hirst,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet, after a pause; he spoke meditatively;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see circles of chalk between people\xe2\x80\x99s feet. I sometimes wish I\r\ndid. It seems to me so tremendously complicated and confused. One can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome to any decision at all; one\xe2\x80\x99s less and less capable of making\r\njudgments. D\xe2\x80\x99you find that? And then one never knows what any one\r\nfeels. We\xe2\x80\x99re all in the dark. We try to find out, but can you imagine\r\nanything more ludicrous than one person\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of another person?\r\nOne goes along thinking one knows; but one really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he said this he was leaning on his elbow arranging and rearranging\r\nin the grass the stones which had represented Rachel and her aunts at\r\nluncheon. He was speaking as much to himself as to Rachel. He was\r\nreasoning against the desire, which had returned with intensity, to\r\ntake her in his arms; to have done with indirectness; to explain\r\nexactly what he felt. What he said was against his belief; all the\r\nthings that were important about her he knew; he felt them in the air\r\naround them; but he said nothing; he went on arranging the stones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like you; d\xe2\x80\x99you like me?\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel suddenly observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like you immensely,\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet replied, speaking with the relief of a\r\nperson who is unexpectedly given an opportunity of saying what he wants\r\nto say. He stopped moving the pebbles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMightn\xe2\x80\x99t we call each other Rachel and Terence?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTerence,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cTerence\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s like the cry of an owl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked up with a sudden rush of delight, and in looking at Terence\r\nwith eyes widened by pleasure she was struck by the change that had\r\ncome over the sky behind them. The substantial blue day had faded to a\r\npaler and more ethereal blue; the clouds were pink, far away and\r\nclosely packed together; and the peace of evening had replaced the heat\r\nof the southern afternoon, in which they had started on their walk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be late!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count here, does it?\xe2\x80\x9d Terence asked, as they\r\ngot up and turned inland again. They began to walk rather quickly down\r\nthe hill on a little path between the olive trees.\r\n\r\nThey felt more intimate because they shared the knowledge of what eight\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in Richmond meant. Terence walked in front, for there was not\r\nroom for them side by side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I want to do in writing novels is very much what you want to do\r\nwhen you play the piano, I expect,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, turning and speaking over\r\nhis shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to find out what\xe2\x80\x99s behind things, don\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x94Look\r\nat the lights down there,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cscattered about anyhow.\r\nThings I feel come to me like lights. . . . I want to combine them. . .\r\n. Have you ever seen fireworks that make figures? . . . I want to make\r\nfigures. . . . Is that what you want to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow they were out on the road and could walk side by side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I play the piano? Music is different. . . . But I see what you\r\nmean.\xe2\x80\x9d They tried to invent theories and to make their theories agree.\r\nAs Hewet had no knowledge of music, Rachel took his stick and drew\r\nfigures in the thin white dust to explain how Bach wrote his fugues.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy musical gift was ruined,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, as they walked on after one\r\nof these demonstrations, \xe2\x80\x9cby the village organist at home, who had\r\ninvented a system of notation which he tried to teach me, with the\r\nresult that I never got to the tune-playing at all. My mother thought\r\nmusic wasn\xe2\x80\x99t manly for boys; she wanted me to kill rats and\r\nbirds\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the worst of living in the country. We live in Devonshire.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the loveliest place in the world. Only\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s always difficult at\r\nhome when one\xe2\x80\x99s grown up. I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to know one of my sisters. . . .\r\nOh, here\xe2\x80\x99s your gate\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He pushed it open. They paused for a moment. She\r\ncould not ask him to come in. She could not say that she hoped they\r\nwould meet again; there was nothing to be said, and so without a word\r\nshe went through the gate, and was soon invisible. Directly Hewet lost\r\nsight of her, he felt the old discomfort return, even more strongly\r\nthan before. Their talk had been interrupted in the middle, just as he\r\nwas beginning to say the things he wanted to say. After all, what had\r\nthey been able to say? He ran his mind over the things they had said,\r\nthe random, unnecessary things which had eddied round and round and\r\nused up all the time, and drawn them so close together and flung them\r\nso far apart, and left him in the end unsatisfied, ignorant still of\r\nwhat she felt and of what she was like. What was the use of talking,\r\ntalking, merely talking?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was now the height of the season, and every ship that came from\r\nEngland left a few people on the shores of Santa Marina who drove up to\r\nthe hotel. The fact that the Ambroses had a house where one could\r\nescape momentarily from the slightly inhuman atmosphere of an hotel was\r\na source of genuine pleasure not only to Hirst and Hewet, but to the\r\nElliots, the Thornburys, the Flushings, Miss Allan, Evelyn M., together\r\nwith other people whose identity was so little developed that the\r\nAmbroses did not discover that they possessed names. By degrees there\r\nwas established a kind of correspondence between the two houses, the\r\nbig and the small, so that at most hours of the day one house could\r\nguess what was going on in the other, and the words \xe2\x80\x9cthe villa\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe hotel\xe2\x80\x9d called up the idea of two separate systems of life.\r\nAcquaintances showed signs of developing into friends, for that one tie\r\nto Mrs. Parry\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room had inevitably split into many other ties\r\nattached to different parts of England, and sometimes these alliances\r\nseemed cynically fragile, and sometimes painfully acute, lacking as\r\nthey did the supporting background of organised English life. One night\r\nwhen the moon was round between the trees, Evelyn M. told Helen the\r\nstory of her life, and claimed her everlasting friendship; on another\r\noccasion, merely because of a sigh, or a pause, or a word thoughtlessly\r\ndropped, poor Mrs. Elliot left the villa half in tears, vowing never\r\nagain to meet the cold and scornful woman who had insulted her, and in\r\ntruth, meet again they never did. It did not seem worth while to piece\r\ntogether so slight a friendship.\r\n\r\nHewet, indeed, might have found excellent material at this time up at\r\nthe villa for some chapters in the novel which was to be called\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence, or the Things People don\xe2\x80\x99t say.\xe2\x80\x9d Helen and Rachel had become\r\nvery silent. Having detected, as she thought, a secret, and judging\r\nthat Rachel meant to keep it from her, Mrs. Ambrose respected it\r\ncarefully, but from that cause, though unintentionally, a curious\r\natmosphere of reserve grew up between them. Instead of sharing their\r\nviews upon all subjects, and plunging after an idea wherever it might\r\nlead, they spoke chiefly in comment upon the people they saw, and the\r\nsecret between them made itself felt in what they said even of\r\nThornburys and Elliots. Always calm and unemotional in her judgments,\r\nMrs. Ambrose was now inclined to be definitely pessimistic. She was not\r\nsevere upon individuals so much as incredulous of the kindness of\r\ndestiny, fate, what happens in the long run, and apt to insist that\r\nthis was generally adverse to people in proportion as they deserved\r\nwell. Even this theory she was ready to discard in favour of one which\r\nmade chaos triumphant, things happening for no reason at all, and every\r\none groping about in illusion and ignorance. With a certain pleasure\r\nshe developed these views to her niece, taking a letter from home as\r\nher test: which gave good news, but might just as well have given bad.\r\nHow did she know that at this very moment both her children were not\r\nlying dead, crushed by motor omnibuses? \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s happening to somebody:\r\nwhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it happen to me?\xe2\x80\x9d she would argue, her face taking on the\r\nstoical expression of anticipated sorrow. However sincere these views\r\nmay have been, they were undoubtedly called forth by the irrational\r\nstate of her niece\xe2\x80\x99s mind. It was so fluctuating, and went so quickly\r\nfrom joy to despair, that it seemed necessary to confront it with some\r\nstable opinion which naturally became dark as well as stable. Perhaps\r\nMrs. Ambrose had some idea that in leading the talk into these quarters\r\nshe might discover what was in Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s mind, but it was difficult to\r\njudge, for sometimes she would agree with the gloomiest thing that was\r\nsaid, at other times she refused to listen, and rammed Helen\xe2\x80\x99s theories\r\ndown her throat with laughter, chatter, ridicule of the wildest, and\r\nfierce bursts of anger even at what she called the \xe2\x80\x9ccroaking of a raven\r\nin the mud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard enough without that,\xe2\x80\x9d she asserted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s hard?\xe2\x80\x9d Helen demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLife,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, and then they both became silent.\r\n\r\nHelen might draw her own conclusions as to why life was hard, as to why\r\nan hour later, perhaps, life was something so wonderful and vivid that\r\nthe eyes of Rachel beholding it were positively exhilarating to a\r\nspectator. True to her creed, she did not attempt to interfere,\r\nalthough there were enough of those weak moments of depression to make\r\nit perfectly easy for a less scrupulous person to press through and\r\nknow all, and perhaps Rachel was sorry that she did not choose. All\r\nthese moods ran themselves into one general effect, which Helen\r\ncompared to the sliding of a river, quick, quicker, quicker still, as\r\nit races to a waterfall. Her instinct was to cry out Stop! but even had\r\nthere been any use in crying Stop! she would have refrained, thinking\r\nit best that things should take their way, the water racing because the\r\nearth was shaped to make it race.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that Rachel herself had no suspicion that she was watched, or\r\nthat there was anything in her manner likely to draw attention to her.\r\nWhat had happened to her she did not know. Her mind was very much in\r\nthe condition of the racing water to which Helen compared it. She\r\nwanted to see Terence; she was perpetually wishing to see him when he\r\nwas not there; it was an agony to miss seeing him; agonies were strewn\r\nall about her day on account of him, but she never asked herself what\r\nthis force driving through her life arose from. She thought of no\r\nresult any more than a tree perpetually pressed downwards by the wind\r\nconsiders the result of being pressed downwards by the wind.\r\n\r\nDuring the two or three weeks which had passed since their walk, half a\r\ndozen notes from him had accumulated in her drawer. She would read\r\nthem, and spend the whole morning in a daze of happiness; the sunny\r\nland outside the window being no less capable of analysing its own\r\ncolour and heat than she was of analysing hers. In these moods she\r\nfound it impossible to read or play the piano, even to move being\r\nbeyond her inclination. The time passed without her noticing it. When\r\nit was dark she was drawn to the window by the lights of the hotel. A\r\nlight that went in and out was the light in Terence\xe2\x80\x99s window: there he\r\nsat, reading perhaps, or now he was walking up and down pulling out one\r\nbook after another; and now he was seated in his chair again, and she\r\ntried to imagine what he was thinking about. The steady lights marked\r\nthe rooms where Terence sat with people moving round him. Every one who\r\nstayed in the hotel had a peculiar romance and interest about them.\r\nThey were not ordinary people. She would attribute wisdom to Mrs.\r\nElliot, beauty to Susan Warrington, a splendid vitality to Evelyn M.,\r\nbecause Terence spoke to them. As unreflecting and pervasive were the\r\nmoods of depression. Her mind was as the landscape outside when dark\r\nbeneath clouds and straitly lashed by wind and hail. Again she would\r\nsit passive in her chair exposed to pain, and Helen\xe2\x80\x99s fantastical or\r\ngloomy words were like so many darts goading her to cry out against the\r\nhardness of life. Best of all were the moods when for no reason again\r\nthis stress of feeling slackened, and life went on as usual, only with\r\na joy and colour in its events that was unknown before; they had a\r\nsignificance like that which she had seen in the tree: the nights were\r\nblack bars separating her from the days; she would have liked to run\r\nall the days into one long continuity of sensation. Although these\r\nmoods were directly or indirectly caused by the presence of Terence or\r\nthe thought of him, she never said to herself that she was in love with\r\nhim, or considered what was to happen if she continued to feel such\r\nthings, so that Helen\xe2\x80\x99s image of the river sliding on to the waterfall\r\nhad a great likeness to the facts, and the alarm which Helen sometimes\r\nfelt was justified.\r\n\r\nIn her curious condition of unanalysed sensations she was incapable of\r\nmaking a plan which should have any effect upon her state of mind. She\r\nabandoned herself to the mercy of accidents, missing Terence one day,\r\nmeeting him the next, receiving his letters always with a start of\r\nsurprise. Any woman experienced in the progress of courtship would have\r\ncome by certain opinions from all this which would have given her at\r\nleast a theory to go upon; but no one had ever been in love with\r\nRachel, and she had never been in love with any one. Moreover, none of\r\nthe books she read, from _Wuthering Heights_ to _Man and Superman_, and\r\nthe plays of Ibsen, suggested from their analysis of love that what\r\ntheir heroines felt was what she was feeling now. It seemed to her that\r\nher sensations had no name.\r\n\r\nShe met Terence frequently. When they did not meet, he was apt to send\r\na note with a book or about a book, for he had not been able after all\r\nto neglect that approach to intimacy. But sometimes he did not come or\r\ndid not write for several days at a time. Again when they met their\r\nmeeting might be one of inspiriting joy or of harassing despair. Over\r\nall their partings hung the sense of interruption, leaving them both\r\nunsatisfied, though ignorant that the other shared the feeling.\r\n\r\nIf Rachel was ignorant of her own feelings, she was even more\r\ncompletely ignorant of his. At first he moved as a god; as she came to\r\nknow him better he was still the centre of light, but combined with\r\nthis beauty a wonderful power of making her daring and confident of\r\nherself. She was conscious of emotions and powers which she had never\r\nsuspected in herself, and of a depth in the world hitherto unknown.\r\nWhen she thought of their relationship she saw rather than reasoned,\r\nrepresenting her view of what Terence felt by a picture of him drawn\r\nacross the room to stand by her side. This passage across the room\r\namounted to a physical sensation, but what it meant she did not know.\r\n\r\nThus the time went on, wearing a calm, bright look upon its surface.\r\nLetters came from England, letters came from Willoughby, and the days\r\naccumulated their small events which shaped the year. Superficially,\r\nthree odes of Pindar were mended, Helen covered about five inches of\r\nher embroidery, and St. John completed the first two acts of a play. He\r\nand Rachel being now very good friends, he read them aloud to her, and\r\nshe was so genuinely impressed by the skill of his rhythms and the\r\nvariety of his adjectives, as well as by the fact that he was Terence\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriend, that he began to wonder whether he was not intended for\r\nliterature rather than for law. It was a time of profound thought and\r\nsudden revelations for more than one couple, and several single people.\r\n\r\nA Sunday came, which no one in the villa with the exception of Rachel\r\nand the Spanish maid proposed to recognise. Rachel still went to\r\nchurch, because she had never, according to Helen, taken the trouble to\r\nthink about it. Since they had celebrated the service at the hotel she\r\nwent there expecting to get some pleasure from her passage across the\r\ngarden and through the hall of the hotel, although it was very doubtful\r\nwhether she would see Terence, or at any rate have the chance of\r\nspeaking to him.\r\n\r\nAs the greater number of visitors at the hotel were English, there was\r\nalmost as much difference between Sunday and Wednesday as there is in\r\nEngland, and Sunday appeared here as there, the mute black ghost or\r\npenitent spirit of the busy weekday. The English could not pale the\r\nsunshine, but they could in some miraculous way slow down the hours,\r\ndull the incidents, lengthen the meals, and make even the servants and\r\npage-boys wear a look of boredom and propriety. The best clothes which\r\nevery one put on helped the general effect; it seemed that no lady\r\ncould sit down without bending a clean starched petticoat, and no\r\ngentleman could breathe without a sudden crackle from a stiff\r\nshirt-front. As the hands of the clock neared eleven, on this\r\nparticular Sunday, various people tended to draw together in the hall,\r\nclasping little red-leaved books in their hands. The clock marked a few\r\nminutes to the hour when a stout black figure passed through the hall\r\nwith a preoccupied expression, as though he would rather not recognise\r\nsalutations, although aware of them, and disappeared down the corridor\r\nwhich led from it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bax,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Thornbury whispered.\r\n\r\nThe little group of people then began to move off in the same direction\r\nas the stout black figure. Looked at in an odd way by people who made\r\nno effort to join them, they moved with one exception slowly and\r\nconsciously towards the stairs. Mrs. Flushing was the exception. She\r\ncame running downstairs, strode across the hall, joined the procession\r\nmuch out of breath, demanding of Mrs. Thornbury in an agitated whisper,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere, where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are all going,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Thornbury gently, and soon they were\r\ndescending the stairs two by two. Rachel was among the first to\r\ndescend. She did not see that Terence and Hirst came in at the rear\r\npossessed of no black volume, but of one thin book bound in light-blue\r\ncloth, which St. John carried under his arm.\r\n\r\nThe chapel was the old chapel of the monks. It was a profound cool\r\nplace where they had said Mass for hundreds of years, and done penance\r\nin the cold moonlight, and worshipped old brown pictures and carved\r\nsaints which stood with upraised hands of blessing in the hollows in\r\nthe walls. The transition from Catholic to Protestant worship had been\r\nbridged by a time of disuse, when there were no services, and the place\r\nwas used for storing jars of oil, liqueur, and deck-chairs; the hotel\r\nflourishing, some religious body had taken the place in hand, and it\r\nwas now fitted out with a number of glazed yellow benches,\r\nclaret-coloured footstools; it had a small pulpit, and a brass eagle\r\ncarrying the Bible on its back, while the piety of different women had\r\nsupplied ugly squares of carpet, and long strips of embroidery heavily\r\nwrought with monograms in gold.\r\n\r\nAs the congregation entered they were met by mild sweet chords issuing\r\nfrom a harmonium, where Miss Willett, concealed from view by a baize\r\ncurtain, struck emphatic chords with uncertain fingers. The sound\r\nspread through the chapel as the rings of water spread from a fallen\r\nstone. The twenty or twenty-five people who composed the congregation\r\nfirst bowed their heads and then sat up and looked about them. It was\r\nvery quiet, and the light down here seemed paler than the light above.\r\nThe usual bows and smiles were dispensed with, but they recognised each\r\nother. The Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Prayer was read over them. As the childlike battle of\r\nvoices rose, the congregation, many of whom had only met on the\r\nstaircase, felt themselves pathetically united and well-disposed\r\ntowards each other. As if the prayer were a torch applied to fuel, a\r\nsmoke seemed to rise automatically and fill the place with the ghosts\r\nof innumerable services on innumerable Sunday mornings at home. Susan\r\nWarrington in particular was conscious of the sweetest sense of\r\nsisterhood, as she covered her face with her hands and saw slips of\r\nbent backs through the chinks between her fingers. Her emotions rose\r\ncalmly and evenly, approving of herself and of life at the same time.\r\nIt was all so quiet and so good. But having created this peaceful\r\natmosphere Mr. Bax suddenly turned the page and read a psalm. Though he\r\nread it with no change of voice the mood was broken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe merciful unto me, O God,\xe2\x80\x9d he read, \xe2\x80\x9cfor man goeth about to devour\r\nme: he is daily fighting and troubling me. . . . They daily mistake my\r\nwords: all that they imagine is to do me evil. They hold all together\r\nand keep themselves close. . . . Break their teeth, O God, in their\r\nmouths; smite the jaw-bones of the lions, O Lord: let them fall away\r\nlike water that runneth apace; and when they shoot their arrows let\r\nthem be rooted out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing in Susan\xe2\x80\x99s experience at all corresponded with this, and as she\r\nhad no love of language she had long ceased to attend to such remarks,\r\nalthough she followed them with the same kind of mechanical respect\r\nwith which she heard many of Lear\xe2\x80\x99s speeches read aloud. Her mind was\r\nstill serene and really occupied with praise of her own nature and\r\npraise of God, that is of the solemn and satisfactory order of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nBut it could be seen from a glance at their faces that most of the\r\nothers, the men in particular, felt the inconvenience of the sudden\r\nintrusion of this old savage. They looked more secular and critical as\r\nthey listened to the ravings of the old black man with a cloth round\r\nhis loins cursing with vehement gesture by a camp-fire in the desert.\r\nAfter that there was a general sound of pages being turned as if they\r\nwere in class, and then they read a little bit of the Old Testament\r\nabout making a well, very much as school boys translate an easy passage\r\nfrom the _Anabasis_ when they have shut up their French grammar. Then\r\nthey returned to the New Testament and the sad and beautiful figure of\r\nChrist. While Christ spoke they made another effort to fit his\r\ninterpretation of life upon the lives they lived, but as they were all\r\nvery different, some practical, some ambitious, some stupid, some wild\r\nand experimental, some in love, and others long past any feeling except\r\na feeling of comfort, they did very different things with the words of\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\nFrom their faces it seemed that for the most part they made no effort\r\nat all, and, recumbent as it were, accepted the ideas the words gave as\r\nrepresenting goodness, in the same way, no doubt, as one of those\r\nindustrious needlewomen had accepted the bright ugly pattern on her mat\r\nas beauty.\r\n\r\nWhatever the reason might be, for the first time in her life, instead\r\nof slipping at once into some curious pleasant cloud of emotion, too\r\nfamiliar to be considered, Rachel listened critically to what was being\r\nsaid. By the time they had swung in an irregular way from prayer to\r\npsalm, from psalm to history, from history to poetry, and Mr. Bax was\r\ngiving out his text, she was in a state of acute discomfort. Such was\r\nthe discomfort she felt when forced to sit through an unsatisfactory\r\npiece of music badly played. Tantalised, enraged by the clumsy\r\ninsensitiveness of the conductor, who put the stress on the wrong\r\nplaces, and annoyed by the vast flock of the audience tamely praising\r\nand acquiescing without knowing or caring, so she was now tantalised\r\nand enraged, only here, with eyes half-shut and lips pursed together,\r\nthe atmosphere of forced solemnity increased her anger. All round her\r\nwere people pretending to feel what they did not feel, while somewhere\r\nabove her floated the idea which they could none of them grasp, which\r\nthey pretended to grasp, always escaping out of reach, a beautiful\r\nidea, an idea like a butterfly. One after another, vast and hard and\r\ncold, appeared to her the churches all over the world where this\r\nblundering effort and misunderstanding were perpetually going on, great\r\nbuildings, filled with innumerable men and women, not seeing clearly,\r\nwho finally gave up the effort to see, and relapsed tamely into praise\r\nand acquiescence, half-shutting their eyes and pursing up their lips.\r\nThe thought had the same sort of physical discomfort as is caused by a\r\nfilm of mist always coming between the eyes and the printed page. She\r\ndid her best to brush away the film and to conceive something to be\r\nworshipped as the service went on, but failed, always misled by the\r\nvoice of Mr. Bax saying things which misrepresented the idea, and by\r\nthe patter of baaing inexpressive human voices falling round her like\r\ndamp leaves. The effort was tiring and dispiriting. She ceased to\r\nlisten, and fixed her eyes on the face of a woman near her, a hospital\r\nnurse, whose expression of devout attention seemed to prove that she\r\nwas at any rate receiving satisfaction. But looking at her carefully\r\nshe came to the conclusion that the hospital nurse was only slavishly\r\nacquiescent, and that the look of satisfaction was produced by no\r\nsplendid conception of God within her. How, indeed, could she conceive\r\nanything far outside her own experience, a woman with a commonplace\r\nface like hers, a little round red face, upon which trivial duties and\r\ntrivial spites had drawn lines, whose weak blue eyes saw without\r\nintensity or individuality, whose features were blurred, insensitive,\r\nand callous? She was adoring something shallow and smug, clinging to\r\nit, so the obstinate mouth witnessed, with the assiduity of a limpet;\r\nnothing would tear her from her demure belief in her own virtue and the\r\nvirtues of her religion. She was a limpet, with the sensitive side of\r\nher stuck to a rock, for ever dead to the rush of fresh and beautiful\r\nthings past her. The face of this single worshipper became printed on\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s mind with an impression of keen horror, and she had it\r\nsuddenly revealed to her what Helen meant and St. John meant when they\r\nproclaimed their hatred of Christianity. With the violence that now\r\nmarked her feelings, she rejected all that she had implicitly believed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Bax was half-way through the second lesson. She looked at\r\nhim. He was a man of the world with supple lips and an agreeable\r\nmanner, he was indeed a man of much kindliness and simplicity, though\r\nby no means clever, but she was not in the mood to give any one credit\r\nfor such qualities, and examined him as though he were an epitome of\r\nall the vices of his service.\r\n\r\nRight at the back of the chapel Mrs. Flushing, Hirst, and Hewet sat in\r\na row in a very different frame of mind. Hewet was staring at the roof\r\nwith his legs stuck out in front of him, for as he had never tried to\r\nmake the service fit any feeling or idea of his, he was able to enjoy\r\nthe beauty of the language without hindrance. His mind was occupied\r\nfirst with accidental things, such as the women\xe2\x80\x99s hair in front of him,\r\nthe light on the faces, then with the words which seemed to him\r\nmagnificent, and then more vaguely with the characters of the other\r\nworshippers. But when he suddenly perceived Rachel, all these thoughts\r\nwere driven out of his head, and he thought only of her. The psalms,\r\nthe prayers, the Litany, and the sermon were all reduced to one\r\nchanting sound which paused, and then renewed itself, a little higher\r\nor a little lower. He stared alternately at Rachel and at the ceiling,\r\nbut his expression was now produced not by what he saw but by something\r\nin his mind. He was almost as painfully disturbed by his thoughts as\r\nshe was by hers.\r\n\r\nEarly in the service Mrs. Flushing had discovered that she had taken up\r\na Bible instead of a prayer-book, and, as she was sitting next to\r\nHirst, she stole a glance over his shoulder. He was reading steadily in\r\nthe thin pale-blue volume. Unable to understand, she peered closer,\r\nupon which Hirst politely laid the book before her, pointing to the\r\nfirst line of a Greek poem and then to the translation opposite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered inquisitively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSappho,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cThe one Swinburne did\xe2\x80\x94the best thing that\xe2\x80\x99s ever\r\nbeen written.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Flushing could not resist such an opportunity. She gulped down the\r\nOde to Aphrodite during the Litany, keeping herself with difficulty\r\nfrom asking when Sappho lived, and what else she wrote worth reading,\r\nand contriving to come in punctually at the end with \xe2\x80\x9cthe forgiveness\r\nof sins, the Resurrection of the body, and the life everlastin\xe2\x80\x99. Amen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Hirst took out an envelope and began scribbling on the back\r\nof it. When Mr. Bax mounted the pulpit he shut up Sappho with his\r\nenvelope between the pages, settled his spectacles, and fixed his gaze\r\nintently upon the clergyman. Standing in the pulpit he looked very\r\nlarge and fat; the light coming through the greenish unstained\r\nwindow-glass made his face appear smooth and white like a very large\r\negg.\r\n\r\nHe looked round at all the faces looking mildly up at him, although\r\nsome of them were the faces of men and women old enough to be his\r\ngrandparents, and gave out his text with weighty significance. The\r\nargument of the sermon was that visitors to this beautiful land,\r\nalthough they were on a holiday, owed a duty to the natives. It did\r\nnot, in truth, differ very much from a leading article upon topics of\r\ngeneral interest in the weekly newspapers. It rambled with a kind of\r\namiable verbosity from one heading to another, suggesting that all\r\nhuman beings are very much the same under their skins, illustrating\r\nthis by the resemblance of the games which little Spanish boys play to\r\nthe games little boys in London streets play, observing that very small\r\nthings do influence people, particularly natives; in fact, a very dear\r\nfriend of Mr. Bax\xe2\x80\x99s had told him that the success of our rule in India,\r\nthat vast country, largely depended upon the strict code of politeness\r\nwhich the English adopted towards the natives, which led to the remark\r\nthat small things were not necessarily small, and that somehow to the\r\nvirtue of sympathy, which was a virtue never more needed than to-day,\r\nwhen we lived in a time of experiment and upheaval\xe2\x80\x94witness the\r\naeroplane and wireless telegraph, and there were other problems which\r\nhardly presented themselves to our fathers, but which no man who called\r\nhimself a man could leave unsettled. Here Mr. Bax became more\r\ndefinitely clerical, if it were possible, he seemed to speak with a\r\ncertain innocent craftiness, as he pointed out that all this laid a\r\nspecial duty upon earnest Christians. What men were inclined to say now\r\nwas, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, that fellow\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s a parson.\xe2\x80\x9d What we want them to say is,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a good fellow\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in other words, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is my brother.\xe2\x80\x9d He exhorted\r\nthem to keep in touch with men of the modern type; they must sympathise\r\nwith their multifarious interests in order to keep before their eyes\r\nthat whatever discoveries were made there was one discovery which could\r\nnot be superseded, which was indeed as much of a necessity to the most\r\nsuccessful and most brilliant of them all as it had been to their\r\nfathers. The humblest could help; the least important things had an\r\ninfluence (here his manner became definitely priestly and his remarks\r\nseemed to be directed to women, for indeed Mr. Bax\xe2\x80\x99s congregations were\r\nmainly composed of women, and he was used to assigning them their\r\nduties in his innocent clerical campaigns). Leaving more definite\r\ninstruction, he passed on, and his theme broadened into a peroration\r\nfor which he drew a long breath and stood very upright,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAs a drop of\r\nwater, detached, alone, separate from others, falling from the cloud\r\nand entering the great ocean, alters, so scientists tell us, not only\r\nthe immediate spot in the ocean where it falls, but all the myriad\r\ndrops which together compose the great universe of waters, and by this\r\nmeans alters the configuration of the globe and the lives of millions\r\nof sea creatures, and finally the lives of the men and women who seek\r\ntheir living upon the shores\xe2\x80\x94as all this is within the compass of a\r\nsingle drop of water, such as any rain shower sends in millions to lose\r\nthemselves in the earth, to lose themselves we say, but we know very\r\nwell that the fruits of the earth could not flourish without them\xe2\x80\x94so is\r\na marvel comparable to this within the reach of each one of us, who\r\ndropping a little word or a little deed into the great universe alters\r\nit; yea, it is a solemn thought, _alters_ it, for good or for evil, not\r\nfor one instant, or in one vicinity, but throughout the entire race,\r\nand for all eternity.\xe2\x80\x9d Whipping round as though to avoid applause, he\r\ncontinued with the same breath, but in a different tone of voice,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nnow to God the Father . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave his blessing, and then, while the solemn chords again issued\r\nfrom the harmonium behind the curtain, the different people began\r\nscraping and fumbling and moving very awkwardly and consciously towards\r\nthe door. Half-way upstairs, at a point where the light and sounds of\r\nthe upper world conflicted with the dimness and the dying hymn-tune of\r\nthe under, Rachel felt a hand drop upon her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vinrace,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Flushing whispered peremptorily, \xe2\x80\x9cstay to\r\nluncheon. It\xe2\x80\x99s such a dismal day. They don\xe2\x80\x99t even give one beef for\r\nluncheon. Please stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere they came out into the hall, where once more the little band was\r\ngreeted with curious respectful glances by the people who had not gone\r\nto church, although their clothing made it clear that they approved of\r\nSunday to the very verge of going to church. Rachel felt unable to\r\nstand any more of this particular atmosphere, and was about to say she\r\nmust go back, when Terence passed them, drawn along in talk with Evelyn\r\nM. Rachel thereupon contented herself with saying that the people\r\nlooked very respectable, which negative remark Mrs. Flushing\r\ninterpreted to mean that she would stay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnglish people abroad!\xe2\x80\x9d she returned with a vivid flash of malice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t they awful! But we won\xe2\x80\x99t stay here,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, plucking at\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s arm. \xe2\x80\x9cCome up to my room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bore her past Hewet and Evelyn and the Thornburys and the Elliots.\r\nHewet stepped forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuncheon\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vinrace has promised to lunch with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Flushing, and\r\nbegan to pound energetically up the staircase, as though the middle\r\nclasses of England were in pursuit. She did not stop until she had\r\nslammed her bedroom door behind them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what did you think of it?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded, panting slightly.\r\n\r\nAll the disgust and horror which Rachel had been accumulating burst\r\nforth beyond her control.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it the most loathsome exhibition I\xe2\x80\x99d ever seen!\xe2\x80\x9d she broke\r\nout. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can they\xe2\x80\x94how dare they\xe2\x80\x94what do you mean by it\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Bax,\r\nhospital nurses, old men, prostitutes, disgusting\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hit off the points she remembered as fast as she could, but she was\r\ntoo indignant to stop to analyse her feelings. Mrs. Flushing watched\r\nher with keen gusto as she stood ejaculating with emphatic movements of\r\nher head and hands in the middle of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, go on, do go on,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed, clapping her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndelightful to hear you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why do you go?\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been every Sunday of my life ever since I can remember,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nFlushing chuckled, as though that were a reason by itself.\r\n\r\nRachel turned abruptly to the window. She did not know what it was that\r\nhad put her into such a passion; the sight of Terence in the hall had\r\nconfused her thoughts, leaving her merely indignant. She looked\r\nstraight at their own villa, half-way up the side of the mountain. The\r\nmost familiar view seen framed through glass has a certain unfamiliar\r\ndistinction, and she grew calm as she gazed. Then she remembered that\r\nshe was in the presence of some one she did not know well, and she\r\nturned and looked at Mrs. Flushing. Mrs. Flushing was still sitting on\r\nthe edge of the bed, looking up, with her lips parted, so that her\r\nstrong white teeth showed in two rows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich d\xe2\x80\x99you like best, Mr. Hewet or Mr. Hirst?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Hewet,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel replied, but her voice did not sound natural.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is the one who reads Greek in church?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Flushing demanded.\r\n\r\nIt might have been either of them and while Mrs. Flushing proceeded to\r\ndescribe them both, and to say that both frightened her, but one\r\nfrightened her more than the other, Rachel looked for a chair. The\r\nroom, of course, was one of the largest and most luxurious in the\r\nhotel. There were a great many arm-chairs and settees covered in brown\r\nholland, but each of these was occupied by a large square piece of\r\nyellow cardboard, and all the pieces of cardboard were dotted or lined\r\nwith spots or dashes of bright oil paint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99re not to look at those,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Flushing as she saw\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s eye wander. She jumped up, and turned as many as she could,\r\nface downwards, upon the floor. Rachel, however, managed to possess\r\nherself of one of them, and, with the vanity of an artist, Mrs.\r\nFlushing demanded anxiously, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a hill,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel replied. There could be no doubt that Mrs.\r\nFlushing had represented the vigorous and abrupt fling of the earth up\r\ninto the air; you could almost see the clods flying as it whirled.\r\n\r\nRachel passed from one to another. They were all marked by something of\r\nthe jerk and decision of their maker; they were all perfectly untrained\r\nonslaughts of the brush upon some half-realised idea suggested by hill\r\nor tree; and they were all in some way characteristic of Mrs. Flushing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see things movin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Flushing explained. \xe2\x80\x9cSo\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she swept her hand\r\nthrough a yard of the air. She then took up one of the cardboards which\r\nRachel had laid aside, seated herself on a stool, and began to flourish\r\na stump of charcoal. While she occupied herself in strokes which seemed\r\nto serve her as speech serves others, Rachel, who was very restless,\r\nlooked about her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen the wardrobe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Flushing after a pause, speaking\r\nindistinctly because of a paint-brush in her mouth, \xe2\x80\x9cand look at the\r\nthings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Rachel hesitated, Mrs. Flushing came forward, still with a\r\npaint-brush in her mouth, flung open the wings of her wardrobe, and\r\ntossed a quantity of shawls, stuffs, cloaks, embroideries, on to the\r\nbed. Rachel began to finger them. Mrs. Flushing came up once more, and\r\ndropped a quantity of beads, brooches, earrings, bracelets, tassels,\r\nand combs among the draperies. Then she went back to her stool and\r\nbegan to paint in silence. The stuffs were coloured and dark and pale;\r\nthey made a curious swarm of lines and colours upon the counterpane,\r\nwith the reddish lumps of stone and peacocks\xe2\x80\x99 feathers and clear pale\r\ntortoise-shell combs lying among them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe women wore them hundreds of years ago, they wear \xe2\x80\x99em still,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nFlushing remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cMy husband rides about and finds \xe2\x80\x99em; they don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what they\xe2\x80\x99re worth, so we get \xe2\x80\x99em cheap. And we shall sell \xe2\x80\x99em to\r\nsmart women in London,\xe2\x80\x9d she chuckled, as though the thought of these\r\nladies and their absurd appearance amused her. After painting for some\r\nminutes, she suddenly laid down her brush and fixed her eyes upon\r\nRachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you what I want to do,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to go up there and\r\nsee things for myself. It\xe2\x80\x99s silly stayin\xe2\x80\x99 here with a pack of old maids\r\nas though we were at the seaside in England. I want to go up the river\r\nand see the natives in their camps. It\xe2\x80\x99s only a matter of ten days\r\nunder canvas. My husband\xe2\x80\x99s done it. One would lie out under the trees\r\nat night and be towed down the river by day, and if we saw anythin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnice we\xe2\x80\x99d shout out and tell \xe2\x80\x99em to stop.\xe2\x80\x9d She rose and began piercing\r\nthe bed again and again with a long golden pin, as she watched to see\r\nwhat effect her suggestion had upon Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must make up a party,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cTen people could hire a\r\nlaunch. Now you\xe2\x80\x99ll come, and Mrs. Ambrose\xe2\x80\x99ll come, and will Mr. Hirst\r\nand t\xe2\x80\x99other gentleman come? Where\xe2\x80\x99s a pencil?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe became more and more determined and excited as she evolved her\r\nplan. She sat on the edge of the bed and wrote down a list of surnames,\r\nwhich she invariably spelt wrong. Rachel was enthusiastic, for indeed\r\nthe idea was immeasurably delightful to her. She had always had a great\r\ndesire to see the river, and the name of Terence threw a lustre over\r\nthe prospect, which made it almost too good to come true. She did what\r\nshe could to help Mrs. Flushing by suggesting names, helping her to\r\nspell them, and counting up the days of the week upon her fingers. As\r\nMrs. Flushing wanted to know all she could tell her about the birth and\r\npursuits of every person she suggested, and threw in wild stories of\r\nher own as to the temperaments and habits of artists, and people of the\r\nsame name who used to come to Chillingley in the old days, but were\r\ndoubtless not the same, though they too were very clever men interested\r\nin Egyptology, the business took some time.\r\n\r\nAt last Mrs. Flushing sought her diary for help, the method of\r\nreckoning dates on the fingers proving unsatisfactory. She opened and\r\nshut every drawer in her writing-table, and then cried furiously,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYarmouth! Yarmouth! Drat the woman! She\xe2\x80\x99s always out of the way when\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s wanted!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment the luncheon gong began to work itself into its midday\r\nfrenzy. Mrs. Flushing rang her bell violently. The door was opened by a\r\nhandsome maid who was almost as upright as her mistress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Yarmouth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Flushing, \xe2\x80\x9cjust find my diary and see where\r\nten days from now would bring us to, and ask the hall porter how many\r\nmen \xe2\x80\x99ud be wanted to row eight people up the river for a week, and what\r\nit \xe2\x80\x99ud cost, and put it on a slip of paper and leave it on my\r\ndressing-table. Now\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she pointed at the door with a superb forefinger\r\nso that Rachel had to lead the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, and Yarmouth,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Flushing called back over her shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cPut\r\nthose things away and hang \xe2\x80\x99em in their right places, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good\r\ngirl, or it fusses Mr. Flushin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo all of which Yarmouth merely replied, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs they entered the long dining-room it was obvious that the day was\r\nstill Sunday, although the mood was slightly abating. The Flushings\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntable was set by the side in the window, so that Mrs. Flushing could\r\nscrutinise each figure as it entered, and her curiosity seemed to be\r\nintense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld Mrs. Paley,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered as the wheeled chair slowly made its\r\nway through the door, Arthur pushing behind. \xe2\x80\x9cThornburys\xe2\x80\x9d came next.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat nice woman,\xe2\x80\x9d she nudged Rachel to look at Miss Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s her\r\nname?\xe2\x80\x9d The painted lady who always came in late, tripping into the room\r\nwith a prepared smile as though she came out upon a stage, might well\r\nhave quailed before Mrs. Flushing\xe2\x80\x99s stare, which expressed her steely\r\nhostility to the whole tribe of painted ladies. Next came the two young\r\nmen whom Mrs. Flushing called collectively the Hirsts. They sat down\r\nopposite, across the gangway.\r\n\r\nMr. Flushing treated his wife with a mixture of admiration and\r\nindulgence, making up by the suavity and fluency of his speech for the\r\nabruptness of hers. While she darted and ejaculated he gave Rachel a\r\nsketch of the history of South American art. He would deal with one of\r\nhis wife\xe2\x80\x99s exclamations, and then return as smoothly as ever to his\r\ntheme. He knew very well how to make a luncheon pass agreeably, without\r\nbeing dull or intimate. He had formed the opinion, so he told Rachel,\r\nthat wonderful treasures lay hid in the depths of the land; the things\r\nRachel had seen were merely trifles picked up in the course of one\r\nshort journey. He thought there might be giant gods hewn out of stone\r\nin the mountain-side; and colossal figures standing by themselves in\r\nthe middle of vast green pasture lands, where none but natives had ever\r\ntrod. Before the dawn of European art he believed that the primitive\r\nhuntsmen and priests had built temples of massive stone slabs, had\r\nformed out of the dark rocks and the great cedar trees majestic figures\r\nof gods and of beasts, and symbols of the great forces, water, air, and\r\nforest among which they lived. There might be prehistoric towns, like\r\nthose in Greece and Asia, standing in open places among the trees,\r\nfilled with the works of this early race. Nobody had been there;\r\nscarcely anything was known. Thus talking and displaying the most\r\npicturesque of his theories, Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s attention was fixed upon him.\r\n\r\nShe did not see that Hewet kept looking at her across the gangway,\r\nbetween the figures of waiters hurrying past with plates. He was\r\ninattentive, and Hirst was finding him also very cross and\r\ndisagreeable. They had touched upon all the usual topics\xe2\x80\x94upon politics\r\nand literature, gossip and Christianity. They had quarrelled over the\r\nservice, which was every bit as fine as Sappho, according to Hewet; so\r\nthat Hirst\xe2\x80\x99s paganism was mere ostentation. Why go to church, he\r\ndemanded, merely in order to read Sappho? Hirst observed that he had\r\nlistened to every word of the sermon, as he could prove if Hewet would\r\nlike a repetition of it; and he went to church in order to realise the\r\nnature of his Creator, which he had done very vividly that morning,\r\nthanks to Mr. Bax, who had inspired him to write three of the most\r\nsuperb lines in English literature, an invocation to the Deity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wrote \xe2\x80\x99em on the back of the envelope of my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s last letter,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, and pulled it from between the pages of Sappho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let\xe2\x80\x99s hear them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hewet, slightly mollified by the prospect\r\nof a literary discussion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Hewet, do you wish us both to be flung out of the hotel by an\r\nenraged mob of Thornburys and Elliots?\xe2\x80\x9d Hirst enquired. \xe2\x80\x9cThe merest\r\nwhisper would be sufficient to incriminate me for ever. God!\xe2\x80\x9d he broke\r\nout, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use of attempting to write when the world\xe2\x80\x99s peopled by\r\nsuch damned fools? Seriously, Hewet, I advise you to give up\r\nliterature. What\xe2\x80\x99s the good of it? There\xe2\x80\x99s your audience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded his head at the tables where a very miscellaneous collection\r\nof Europeans were now engaged in eating, in some cases in gnawing, the\r\nstringy foreign fowls. Hewet looked, and grew more out of temper than\r\never. Hirst looked too. His eyes fell upon Rachel, and he bowed to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rather think Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s in love with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, as his eyes\r\nreturned to his plate. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the worst of friendships with young\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x94they tend to fall in love with one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo that Hewet made no answer whatever, and sat singularly still. Hirst\r\ndid not seem to mind getting no answer, for he returned to Mr. Bax\r\nagain, quoting the peroration about the drop of water; and when Hewet\r\nscarcely replied to these remarks either, he merely pursed his lips,\r\nchose a fig, and relapsed quite contentedly into his own thoughts, of\r\nwhich he always had a very large supply. When luncheon was over they\r\nseparated, taking their cups of coffee to different parts of the hall.\r\n\r\nFrom his chair beneath the palm-tree Hewet saw Rachel come out of the\r\ndining-room with the Flushings; he saw them look round for chairs, and\r\nchoose three in a corner where they could go on talking in private. Mr.\r\nFlushing was now in the full tide of his discourse. He produced a sheet\r\nof paper upon which he made drawings as he went on with his talk. He\r\nsaw Rachel lean over and look, pointing to this and that with her\r\nfinger. Hewet unkindly compared Mr. Flushing, who was extremely well\r\ndressed for a hot climate, and rather elaborate in his manner, to a\r\nvery persuasive shop-keeper. Meanwhile, as he sat looking at them, he\r\nwas entangled in the Thornburys and Miss Allan, who, after hovering\r\nabout for a minute or two, settled in chairs round him, holding their\r\ncups in their hands. They wanted to know whether he could tell them\r\nanything about Mr. Bax. Mr. Thornbury as usual sat saying nothing,\r\nlooking vaguely ahead of him, occasionally raising his eye-glasses, as\r\nif to put them on, but always thinking better of it at the last moment,\r\nand letting them fall again. After some discussion, the ladies put it\r\nbeyond a doubt that Mr. Bax was not the son of Mr. William Bax. There\r\nwas a pause. Then Mrs. Thornbury remarked that she was still in the\r\nhabit of saying Queen instead of King in the National Anthem. There was\r\nanother pause. Then Miss Allan observed reflectively that going to\r\nchurch abroad always made her feel as if she had been to a sailor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfuneral.\r\n\r\nThere was then a very long pause, which threatened to be final, when,\r\nmercifully, a bird about the size of a magpie, but of a metallic blue\r\ncolour, appeared on the section of the terrace that could be seen from\r\nwhere they sat. Mrs. Thornbury was led to enquire whether we should\r\nlike it if all our rooks were blue\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do _you_ think, William?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked, touching her husband on the knee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf all our rooks were blue,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\xe2\x80\x94he raised his glasses; he\r\nactually placed them on his nose\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthey would not live long in\r\nWiltshire,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded; he dropped his glasses to his side again. The\r\nthree elderly people now gazed meditatively at the bird, which was so\r\nobliging as to stay in the middle of the view for a considerable space\r\nof time, thus making it unnecessary for them to speak again. Hewet\r\nbegan to wonder whether he might not cross over to the Flushings\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncorner, when Hirst appeared from the background, slipped into a chair\r\nby Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s side, and began to talk to her with every appearance of\r\nfamiliarity. Hewet could stand it no longer. He rose, took his hat and\r\ndashed out of doors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nEverything he saw was distasteful to him. He hated the blue and white,\r\nthe intensity and definiteness, the hum and heat of the south; the\r\nlandscape seemed to him as hard and as romantic as a cardboard\r\nbackground on the stage, and the mountain but a wooden screen against a\r\nsheet painted blue. He walked fast in spite of the heat of the sun.\r\n\r\nTwo roads led out of the town on the eastern side; one branched off\r\ntowards the Ambroses\xe2\x80\x99 villa, the other struck into the country,\r\neventually reaching a village on the plain, but many footpaths, which\r\nhad been stamped in the earth when it was wet, led off from it, across\r\ngreat dry fields, to scattered farm-houses, and the villas of rich\r\nnatives. Hewet stepped off the road on to one of these, in order to\r\navoid the hardness and heat of the main road, the dust of which was\r\nalways being raised in small clouds by carts and ramshackle flies which\r\ncarried parties of festive peasants, or turkeys swelling unevenly like\r\na bundle of air balls beneath a net, or the brass bedstead and black\r\nwooden boxes of some newly wedded pair.\r\n\r\nThe exercise indeed served to clear away the superficial irritations of\r\nthe morning, but he remained miserable. It seemed proved beyond a doubt\r\nthat Rachel was indifferent to him, for she had scarcely looked at him,\r\nand she had talked to Mr. Flushing with just the same interest with\r\nwhich she talked to him. Finally, Hirst\xe2\x80\x99s odious words flicked his mind\r\nlike a whip, and he remembered that he had left her talking to Hirst.\r\nShe was at this moment talking to him, and it might be true, as he\r\nsaid, that she was in love with him. He went over all the evidence for\r\nthis supposition\xe2\x80\x94her sudden interest in Hirst\xe2\x80\x99s writing, her way of\r\nquoting his opinions respectfully, or with only half a laugh; her very\r\nnickname for him, \xe2\x80\x9cthe great Man,\xe2\x80\x9d might have some serious meaning in\r\nit. Supposing that there were an understanding between them, what would\r\nit mean to him?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn it all!\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded, \xe2\x80\x9cam I in love with her?\xe2\x80\x9d To that he could\r\nonly return himself one answer. He certainly was in love with her, if\r\nhe knew what love meant. Ever since he had first seen her he had been\r\ninterested and attracted, more and more interested and attracted, until\r\nhe was scarcely able to think of anything except Rachel. But just as he\r\nwas sliding into one of the long feasts of meditation about them both,\r\nhe checked himself by asking whether he wanted to marry her? That was\r\nthe real problem, for these miseries and agonies could not be endured,\r\nand it was necessary that he should make up his mind. He instantly\r\ndecided that he did not want to marry any one. Partly because he was\r\nirritated by Rachel the idea of marriage irritated him. It immediately\r\nsuggested the picture of two people sitting alone over the fire; the\r\nman was reading, the woman sewing. There was a second picture. He saw a\r\nman jump up, say good-night, leave the company and hasten away with the\r\nquiet secret look of one who is stealing to certain happiness. Both\r\nthese pictures were very unpleasant, and even more so was a third\r\npicture, of husband and wife and friend; and the married people\r\nglancing at each other as though they were content to let something\r\npass unquestioned, being themselves possessed of the deeper truth.\r\nOther pictures\xe2\x80\x94he was walking very fast in his irritation, and they\r\ncame before him without any conscious effort, like pictures on a\r\nsheet\xe2\x80\x94succeeded these. Here were the worn husband and wife sitting with\r\ntheir children round them, very patient, tolerant, and wise. But that\r\ntoo, was an unpleasant picture. He tried all sorts of pictures, taking\r\nthem from the lives of friends of his, for he knew many different\r\nmarried couples; but he saw them always, walled up in a warm firelit\r\nroom. When, on the other hand, he began to think of unmarried people,\r\nhe saw them active in an unlimited world; above all, standing on the\r\nsame ground as the rest, without shelter or advantage. All the most\r\nindividual and humane of his friends were bachelors and spinsters;\r\nindeed he was surprised to find that the women he most admired and knew\r\nbest were unmarried women. Marriage seemed to be worse for them than it\r\nwas for men. Leaving these general pictures he considered the people\r\nwhom he had been observing lately at the hotel. He had often revolved\r\nthese questions in his mind, as he watched Susan and Arthur, or Mr. and\r\nMrs. Thornbury, or Mr. and Mrs. Elliot. He had observed how the shy\r\nhappiness and surprise of the engaged couple had gradually been\r\nreplaced by a comfortable, tolerant state of mind, as if they had\r\nalready done with the adventure of intimacy and were taking up their\r\nparts. Susan used to pursue Arthur about with a sweater, because he had\r\none day let slip that a brother of his had died of pneumonia. The sight\r\namused him, but was not pleasant if you substituted Terence and Rachel\r\nfor Arthur and Susan; and Arthur was far less eager to get you in a\r\ncorner and talk about flying and the mechanics of aeroplanes. They\r\nwould settle down. He then looked at the couples who had been married\r\nfor several years. It was true that Mrs. Thornbury had a husband, and\r\nthat for the most part she was wonderfully successful in bringing him\r\ninto the conversation, but one could not imagine what they said to each\r\nother when they were alone. There was the same difficulty with regard\r\nto the Elliots, except that they probably bickered openly in private.\r\nThey sometimes bickered in public, though these disagreements were\r\npainfully covered over by little insincerities on the part of the wife,\r\nwho was afraid of public opinion, because she was much stupider than\r\nher husband, and had to make efforts to keep hold of him. There could\r\nbe no doubt, he decided, that it would have been far better for the\r\nworld if these couples had separated. Even the Ambroses, whom he\r\nadmired and respected profoundly\xe2\x80\x94in spite of all the love between them,\r\nwas not their marriage too a compromise? She gave way to him; she\r\nspoilt him; she arranged things for him; she who was all truth to\r\nothers was not true to her husband, was not true to her friends if they\r\ncame in conflict with her husband. It was a strange and piteous flaw in\r\nher nature. Perhaps Rachel had been right, then, when she said that\r\nnight in the garden, \xe2\x80\x9cWe bring out what\xe2\x80\x99s worst in each other\xe2\x80\x94we should\r\nlive separate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo, Rachel had been utterly wrong! Every argument seemed to be against\r\nundertaking the burden of marriage until he came to Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s argument,\r\nwhich was manifestly absurd. From having been the pursued, he turned\r\nand became the pursuer. Allowing the case against marriage to lapse, he\r\nbegan to consider the peculiarities of character which had led to her\r\nsaying that. Had she meant it? Surely one ought to know the character\r\nof the person with whom one might spend all one\xe2\x80\x99s life; being a\r\nnovelist, let him try to discover what sort of person she was. When he\r\nwas with her he could not analyse her qualities, because he seemed to\r\nknow them instinctively, but when he was away from her it sometimes\r\nseemed to him that he did not know her at all. She was young, but she\r\nwas also old; she had little self-confidence, and yet she was a good\r\njudge of people. She was happy; but what made her happy? If they were\r\nalone and the excitement had worn off, and they had to deal with the\r\nordinary facts of the day, what would happen? Casting his eye upon his\r\nown character, two things appeared to him: that he was very unpunctual,\r\nand that he disliked answering notes. As far as he knew Rachel was\r\ninclined to be punctual, but he could not remember that he had ever\r\nseen her with a pen in her hand. Let him next imagine a dinner-party,\r\nsay at the Crooms, and Wilson, who had taken her down, talking about\r\nthe state of the Liberal party. She would say\xe2\x80\x94of course she was\r\nabsolutely ignorant of politics. Nevertheless she was intelligent\r\ncertainly, and honest too. Her temper was uncertain\xe2\x80\x94that he had\r\nnoticed\xe2\x80\x94and she was not domestic, and she was not easy, and she was not\r\nquiet, or beautiful, except in some dresses in some lights. But the\r\ngreat gift she had was that she understood what was said to her; there\r\nhad never been any one like her for talking to. You could say\r\nanything\xe2\x80\x94you could say everything, and yet she was never servile. Here\r\nhe pulled himself up, for it seemed to him suddenly that he knew less\r\nabout her than about any one. All these thoughts had occurred to him\r\nmany times already; often had he tried to argue and reason; and again\r\nhe had reached the old state of doubt. He did not know her, and he did\r\nnot know what she felt, or whether they could live together, or whether\r\nhe wanted to marry her, and yet he was in love with her.\r\n\r\nSupposing he went to her and said (he slackened his pace and began to\r\nspeak aloud, as if he were speaking to Rachel):\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI worship you, but I loathe marriage, I hate its smugness, its safety,\r\nits compromise, and the thought of you interfering in my work,\r\nhindering me; what would you answer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped, leant against the trunk of a tree, and gazed without seeing\r\nthem at some stones scattered on the bank of the dry river-bed. He saw\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s face distinctly, the grey eyes, the hair, the mouth; the face\r\nthat could look so many things\xe2\x80\x94plain, vacant, almost insignificant, or\r\nwild, passionate, almost beautiful, yet in his eyes was always the same\r\nbecause of the extraordinary freedom with which she looked at him, and\r\nspoke as she felt. What would she answer? What did she feel? Did she\r\nlove him, or did she feel nothing at all for him or for any other man,\r\nbeing, as she had said that afternoon, free, like the wind or the sea?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99re free!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, in exultation at the thought of her,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99d keep you free. We\xe2\x80\x99d be free together. We\xe2\x80\x99d share everything\r\ntogether. No happiness would be like ours. No lives would compare with\r\nours.\xe2\x80\x9d He opened his arms wide as if to hold her and the world in one\r\nembrace.\r\n\r\nNo longer able to consider marriage, or to weigh coolly what her nature\r\nwas, or how it would be if they lived together, he dropped to the\r\nground and sat absorbed in the thought of her, and soon tormented by\r\nthe desire to be in her presence again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Hewet need not have increased his torments by imagining that Hirst\r\nwas still talking to Rachel. The party very soon broke up, the\r\nFlushings going in one direction, Hirst in another, and Rachel\r\nremaining in the hall, pulling the illustrated papers about, turning\r\nfrom one to another, her movements expressing the unformed restless\r\ndesire in her mind. She did not know whether to go or to stay, though\r\nMrs. Flushing had commanded her to appear at tea. The hall was empty,\r\nsave for Miss Willett who was playing scales with her fingers upon a\r\nsheet of sacred music, and the Carters, an opulent couple who disliked\r\nthe girl, because her shoe laces were untied, and she did not look\r\nsufficiently cheery, which by some indirect process of thought led them\r\nto think that she would not like them. Rachel certainly would not have\r\nliked them, if she had seen them, for the excellent reason that Mr.\r\nCarter waxed his moustache, and Mrs. Carter wore bracelets, and they\r\nwere evidently the kind of people who would not like her; but she was\r\ntoo much absorbed by her own restlessness to think or to look.\r\n\r\nShe was turning over the slippery pages of an American magazine, when\r\nthe hall door swung, a wedge of light fell upon the floor, and a small\r\nwhite figure upon whom the light seemed focussed, made straight across\r\nthe room to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! You here?\xe2\x80\x9d Evelyn exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cJust caught a glimpse of you at\r\nlunch; but you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t condescend to look at _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was part of Evelyn\xe2\x80\x99s character that in spite of many snubs which she\r\nreceived or imagined, she never gave up the pursuit of people she\r\nwanted to know, and in the long run generally succeeded in knowing them\r\nand even in making them like her.\r\n\r\nShe looked round her. \xe2\x80\x9cI hate this place. I hate these people,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d come up to my room with me. I do want to talk to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Rachel had no wish to go or to stay, Evelyn took her by the wrist\r\nand drew her out of the hall and up the stairs. As they went upstairs\r\ntwo steps at a time, Evelyn, who still kept hold of Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\r\nejaculated broken sentences about not caring a hang what people said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should one, if one knows one\xe2\x80\x99s right? And let \xe2\x80\x99em all go to\r\nblazes! Them\xe2\x80\x99s my opinions!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was in a state of great excitement, and the muscles of her arms\r\nwere twitching nervously. It was evident that she was only waiting for\r\nthe door to shut to tell Rachel all about it. Indeed, directly they\r\nwere inside her room, she sat on the end of the bed and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsuppose you think I\xe2\x80\x99m mad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel was not in the mood to think clearly about any one\xe2\x80\x99s state of\r\nmind. She was however in the mood to say straight out whatever occurred\r\nto her without fear of the consequences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody\xe2\x80\x99s proposed to you,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow on earth did you guess that?\xe2\x80\x9d Evelyn exclaimed, some pleasure\r\nmingling with her surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cDo as I look as if I\xe2\x80\x99d just had a\r\nproposal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look as if you had them every day,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I\xe2\x80\x99ve had more than you\xe2\x80\x99ve had,\xe2\x80\x9d Evelyn laughed\r\nrather insincerely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never had one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you will\xe2\x80\x94lots\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s the easiest thing in the world\xe2\x80\x94But that\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s happened this afternoon exactly. It\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a muddle, a\r\ndetestable, horrible, disgusting muddle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went to the wash-stand and began sponging her cheeks with cold\r\nwater; for they were burning hot. Still sponging them and trembling\r\nslightly she turned and explained in the high pitched voice of nervous\r\nexcitement: \xe2\x80\x9cAlfred Perrott says I\xe2\x80\x99ve promised to marry him, and I say\r\nI never did. Sinclair says he\xe2\x80\x99ll shoot himself if I don\xe2\x80\x99t marry him,\r\nand I say, \xe2\x80\x98Well, shoot yourself!\xe2\x80\x99 But of course he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94they never\r\ndo. And Sinclair got hold of me this afternoon and began bothering me\r\nto give an answer, and accusing me of flirting with Alfred Perrott, and\r\ntold me I\xe2\x80\x99d no heart, and was merely a Siren, oh, and quantities of\r\npleasant things like that. So at last I said to him, \xe2\x80\x98Well, Sinclair,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve said enough now. You can just let me go.\xe2\x80\x99 And then he caught me\r\nand kissed me\xe2\x80\x94the disgusting brute\xe2\x80\x94I can still feel his nasty hairy\r\nface just there\xe2\x80\x94as if he\xe2\x80\x99d any right to, after what he\xe2\x80\x99d said!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sponged a spot on her left cheek energetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never met a man that was fit to compare with a woman!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99ve no dignity, they\xe2\x80\x99ve no courage, they\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing but their\r\nbeastly passions and their brute strength! Would any woman have behaved\r\nlike that\xe2\x80\x94if a man had said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want her? We\xe2\x80\x99ve too much\r\nself-respect; we\xe2\x80\x99re infinitely finer than they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe walked about the room, dabbing her wet cheeks with a towel. Tears\r\nwere now running down with the drops of cold water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt makes me angry,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained, drying her eyes.\r\n\r\nRachel sat watching her. She did not think of Evelyn\xe2\x80\x99s position; she\r\nonly thought that the world was full of people in torment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s only one man here I really like,\xe2\x80\x9d Evelyn continued; \xe2\x80\x9cTerence\r\nHewet. One feels as if one could trust him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words Rachel suffered an indescribable chill; her heart seemed\r\nto be pressed together by cold hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy can you trust him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Evelyn. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you have feelings about people?\r\nFeelings you\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely certain are right? I had a long talk with\r\nTerence the other night. I felt we were really friends after that.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s something of a woman in him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She paused as though she were\r\nthinking of very intimate things that Terence had told her, so at least\r\nRachel interpreted her gaze.\r\n\r\nShe tried to force herself to say, \xe2\x80\x9cHas he proposed to you?\xe2\x80\x9d but the\r\nquestion was too tremendous, and in another moment Evelyn was saying\r\nthat the finest men were like women, and women were nobler than men\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nexample, one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine a woman like Lillah Harrison thinking a\r\nmean thing or having anything base about her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to know her!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nShe was becoming much calmer, and her cheeks were now quite dry. Her\r\neyes had regained their usual expression of keen vitality, and she\r\nseemed to have forgotten Alfred and Sinclair and her emotion. \xe2\x80\x9cLillah\r\nruns a home for inebriate women in the Deptford Road,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe started it, managed it, did everything off her own bat, and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnow the biggest of its kind in England. You can\xe2\x80\x99t think what those\r\nwomen are like\xe2\x80\x94and their homes. But she goes among them at all hours of\r\nthe day and night. I\xe2\x80\x99ve often been with her. . . . That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmatter with us. . . . We don\xe2\x80\x99t _do_ things. What do you _do_?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ndemanded, looking at Rachel with a slightly ironical smile. Rachel had\r\nscarcely listened to any of this, and her expression was vacant and\r\nunhappy. She had conceived an equal dislike for Lillah Harrison and her\r\nwork in the Deptford Road, and for Evelyn M. and her profusion of love\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI play,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with an affection of stolid composure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s about it!\xe2\x80\x9d Evelyn laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cWe none of us do anything but play.\r\nAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why women like Lillah Harrison, who\xe2\x80\x99s worth twenty of you\r\nand me, have to work themselves to the bone. But I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of playing,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe went on, lying flat on the bed, and raising her arms above her\r\nhead. Thus stretched out, she looked more diminutive than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to do something. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a splendid idea. Look here, you\r\nmust join. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ve got any amount of stuff in you, though you\r\nlook\xe2\x80\x94well, as if you\xe2\x80\x99d lived all your life in a garden.\xe2\x80\x9d She sat up,\r\nand began to explain with animation. \xe2\x80\x9cI belong to a club in London. It\r\nmeets every Saturday, so it\xe2\x80\x99s called the Saturday Club. We\xe2\x80\x99re supposed\r\nto talk about art, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of talking about art\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s the good of\r\nit? With all kinds of real things going on round one? It isn\xe2\x80\x99t as if\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d got anything to say about art, either. So what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to tell\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked enough about art, and we\xe2\x80\x99d better talk about\r\nlife for a change. Questions that really matter to people\xe2\x80\x99s lives, the\r\nWhite Slave Traffic, Women Suffrage, the Insurance Bill, and so on. And\r\nwhen we\xe2\x80\x99ve made up our mind what we want to do we could form ourselves\r\ninto a society for doing it. . . . I\xe2\x80\x99m certain that if people like\r\nourselves were to take things in hand instead of leaving it to\r\npolicemen and magistrates, we could put a stop to\xe2\x80\x94prostitution\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nlowered her voice at the ugly word\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cin six months. My idea is that men\r\nand women ought to join in these matters. We ought to go into\r\nPiccadilly and stop one of these poor wretches and say: \xe2\x80\x98Now, look\r\nhere, I\xe2\x80\x99m no better than you are, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to be any better,\r\nbut you\xe2\x80\x99re doing what you know to be beastly, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t have you\r\ndoing beastly things, because we\xe2\x80\x99re all the same under our skins, and\r\nif you do a beastly thing it does matter to me.\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s what Mr. Bax\r\nwas saying this morning, and it\xe2\x80\x99s true, though you clever people\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nclever too, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Evelyn began talking\xe2\x80\x94it was a fact she often regretted\xe2\x80\x94her\r\nthoughts came so quickly that she never had any time to listen to other\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts. She continued without more pause than was needed for\r\ntaking breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why the Saturday club people shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do a really great\r\nwork in that way,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course it would want organisation,\r\nsome one to give their life to it, but I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to do that. My\r\nnotion\xe2\x80\x99s to think of the human beings first and let the abstract ideas\r\ntake care of themselves. What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with Lillah\xe2\x80\x94if there is anything\r\nwrong\xe2\x80\x94is that she thinks of Temperance first and the women afterwards.\r\nNow there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say to my credit,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nintellectual or artistic or anything of that sort, but I\xe2\x80\x99m jolly\r\nhuman.\xe2\x80\x9d She slipped off the bed and sat on the floor, looking up at\r\nRachel. She searched up into her face as if she were trying to read\r\nwhat kind of character was concealed behind the face. She put her hand\r\non Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s knee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _is_ being human that counts, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cBeing\r\nreal, whatever Mr. Hirst may say. Are you real?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel felt much as Terence had felt that Evelyn was too close to her,\r\nand that there was something exciting in this closeness, although it\r\nwas also disagreeable. She was spared the need of finding an answer to\r\nthe question, for Evelyn proceeded, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you _believe_ in anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn order to put an end to the scrutiny of these bright blue eyes, and\r\nto relieve her own physical restlessness, Rachel pushed back her chair\r\nand exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cIn everything!\xe2\x80\x9d and began to finger different objects,\r\nthe books on the table, the photographs, the freshly leaved plant with\r\nthe stiff bristles, which stood in a large earthenware pot in the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe in the bed, in the photographs, in the pot, in the balcony,\r\nin the sun, in Mrs. Flushing,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked, still speaking recklessly,\r\nwith something at the back of her mind forcing her to say the things\r\nthat one usually does not say. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in God, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve in Mr. Bax, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in the hospital nurse. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She took up a photograph and, looking at it, did not finish\r\nher sentence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Evelyn, who remained sitting on the floor\r\nbinding her knees together with her arms, and watching Rachel\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\nRachel considered the portrait. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t much believe in her,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe remarked after a time in a low tone of voice.\r\n\r\nMrs. Murgatroyd looked indeed as if the life had been crushed out of\r\nher; she knelt on a chair, gazing piteously from behind the body of a\r\nPomeranian dog which she clasped to her cheek, as if for protection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s my dad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Evelyn, for there were two photographs in one\r\nframe. The second photograph represented a handsome soldier with high\r\nregular features and a heavy black moustache; his hand rested on the\r\nhilt of his sword; there was a decided likeness between him and Evelyn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s because of them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Evelyn, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99m going to help the\r\nother women. You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard about me, I suppose? They weren\xe2\x80\x99t married,\r\nyou see; I\xe2\x80\x99m not anybody in particular. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a bit ashamed of it.\r\nThey loved each other anyhow, and that\xe2\x80\x99s more than most people can say\r\nof their parents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel sat down on the bed, with the two pictures in her hands, and\r\ncompared them\xe2\x80\x94the man and the woman who had, so Evelyn said, loved each\r\nother. That fact interested her more than the campaign on behalf of\r\nunfortunate women which Evelyn was once more beginning to describe. She\r\nlooked again from one to the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you think it\xe2\x80\x99s like,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, as Evelyn paused for a minute,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbeing in love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you never been in love?\xe2\x80\x9d Evelyn asked. \xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94one\xe2\x80\x99s only got to\r\nlook at you to see that,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. She considered. \xe2\x80\x9cI really was in\r\nlove once,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. She fell into reflection, her eyes losing their\r\nbright vitality and approaching something like an expression of\r\ntenderness. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was heavenly!\xe2\x80\x94while it lasted. The worst of it is it\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t last, not with me. That\xe2\x80\x99s the bother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went on to consider the difficulty with Alfred and Sinclair about\r\nwhich she had pretended to ask Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s advice. But she did not want\r\nadvice; she wanted intimacy. When she looked at Rachel, who was still\r\nlooking at the photographs on the bed, she could not help seeing that\r\nRachel was not thinking about her. What was she thinking about, then?\r\nEvelyn was tormented by the little spark of life in her which was\r\nalways trying to work through to other people, and was always being\r\nrebuffed. Falling silent she looked at her visitor, her shoes, her\r\nstockings, the combs in her hair, all the details of her dress in\r\nshort, as though by seizing every detail she might get closer to the\r\nlife within.\r\n\r\nRachel at last put down the photographs, walked to the window and\r\nremarked, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s odd. People talk as much about love as they do about\r\nreligion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d sit down and talk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Evelyn impatiently.\r\n\r\nInstead Rachel opened the window, which was made in two long panes, and\r\nlooked down into the garden below.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where we got lost the first night,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must have\r\nbeen in those bushes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey kill hens down there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Evelyn. \xe2\x80\x9cThey cut their heads off\r\nwith a knife\xe2\x80\x94disgusting! But tell me\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to explore the hotel,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel interrupted. She drew her head\r\nin and looked at Evelyn, who still sat on the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just like other hotels,\xe2\x80\x9d said Evelyn.\r\n\r\nThat might be, although every room and passage and chair in the place\r\nhad a character of its own in Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s eyes; but she could not bring\r\nherself to stay in one place any longer. She moved slowly towards the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it you want?\xe2\x80\x9d said Evelyn. \xe2\x80\x9cYou make me feel as if you were\r\nalways thinking of something you don\xe2\x80\x99t say. . . . Do say it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Rachel made no response to this invitation either. She stopped with\r\nher fingers on the handle of the door, as if she remembered that some\r\nsort of pronouncement was due from her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ll marry one of them,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and then turned the\r\nhandle and shut the door behind her. She walked slowly down the\r\npassage, running her hand along the wall beside her. She did not think\r\nwhich way she was going, and therefore walked down a passage which only\r\nled to a window and a balcony. She looked down at the kitchen premises,\r\nthe wrong side of the hotel life, which was cut off from the right side\r\nby a maze of small bushes. The ground was bare, old tins were scattered\r\nabout, and the bushes wore towels and aprons upon their heads to dry.\r\nEvery now and then a waiter came out in a white apron and threw rubbish\r\non to a heap. Two large women in cotton dresses were sitting on a bench\r\nwith blood-smeared tin trays in front of them and yellow bodies across\r\ntheir knees. They were plucking the birds, and talking as they plucked.\r\nSuddenly a chicken came floundering, half flying, half running into the\r\nspace, pursued by a third woman whose age could hardly be under eighty.\r\nAlthough wizened and unsteady on her legs she kept up the chase, egged\r\non by the laughter of the others; her face was expressive of furious\r\nrage, and as she ran she swore in Spanish. Frightened by hand-clapping\r\nhere, a napkin there, the bird ran this way and that in sharp angles,\r\nand finally fluttered straight at the old woman, who opened her scanty\r\ngrey skirts to enclose it, dropped upon it in a bundle, and then\r\nholding it out cut its head off with an expression of vindictive energy\r\nand triumph combined. The blood and the ugly wriggling fascinated\r\nRachel, so that although she knew that some one had come up behind and\r\nwas standing beside her, she did not turn round until the old woman had\r\nsettled down on the bench beside the others. Then she looked up\r\nsharply, because of the ugliness of what she had seen. It was Miss\r\nAllan who stood beside her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a pretty sight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Allan, \xe2\x80\x9calthough I daresay it\xe2\x80\x99s really\r\nmore humane than our method. . . . I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been in\r\nmy room,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, and turned away as if she meant Rachel to follow\r\nher. Rachel followed, for it seemed possible that each new person might\r\nremove the mystery which burdened her.\r\n\r\nThe bedrooms at the hotel were all on the same pattern, save that some\r\nwere larger and some smaller; they had a floor of dark red tiles; they\r\nhad a high bed, draped in mosquito curtains; they had each a\r\nwriting-table and a dressing-table, and a couple of arm-chairs. But\r\ndirectly a box was unpacked the rooms became very different, so that\r\nMiss Allan\xe2\x80\x99s room was very unlike Evelyn\xe2\x80\x99s room. There were no\r\nvariously coloured hatpins on her dressing-table; no scent-bottles; no\r\nnarrow curved pairs of scissors; no great variety of shoes and boots;\r\nno silk petticoats lying on the chairs. The room was extremely neat.\r\nThere seemed to be two pairs of everything. The writing-table, however,\r\nwas piled with manuscript, and a table was drawn out to stand by the\r\narm-chair on which were two separate heaps of dark library books, in\r\nwhich there were many slips of paper sticking out at different degrees\r\nof thickness. Miss Allan had asked Rachel to come in out of kindness,\r\nthinking that she was waiting about with nothing to do. Moreover, she\r\nliked young women, for she had taught many of them, and having received\r\nso much hospitality from the Ambroses she was glad to be able to repay\r\na minute part of it. She looked about accordingly for something to show\r\nher. The room did not provide much entertainment. She touched her\r\nmanuscript. \xe2\x80\x9cAge of Chaucer; Age of Elizabeth; Age of Dryden,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nreflected; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad there aren\xe2\x80\x99t many more ages. I\xe2\x80\x99m still in the\r\nmiddle of the eighteenth century. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you sit down, Miss Vinrace? The\r\nchair, though small, is firm. . . . Euphues. The germ of the English\r\nnovel,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, glancing at another page. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that the kind of\r\nthing that interests you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at Rachel with great kindness and simplicity, as though she\r\nwould do her utmost to provide anything she wished to have. This\r\nexpression had a remarkable charm in a face otherwise much lined with\r\ncare and thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, it\xe2\x80\x99s music with you, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, recollecting,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I generally find that they don\xe2\x80\x99t go together. Sometimes of course\r\nwe have prodigies\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She was looking about her for something and now saw\r\na jar on the mantelpiece which she reached down and gave to Rachel. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nyou put your finger into this jar you may be able to extract a piece of\r\npreserved ginger. Are you a prodigy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the ginger was deep and could not be reached.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t bother,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as Miss Allan looked about for some other\r\nimplement. \xe2\x80\x9cI daresay I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like preserved ginger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve never tried?\xe2\x80\x9d enquired Miss Allan. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I consider that it is\r\nyour duty to try now. Why, you may add a new pleasure to life, and as\r\nyou are still young\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She wondered whether a button-hook would do. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmake it a rule to try everything,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think it would\r\nbe very annoying if you tasted ginger for the first time on your\r\ndeath-bed, and found you never liked anything so much? I should be so\r\nexceedingly annoyed that I think I should get well on that account\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was now successful, and a lump of ginger emerged on the end of the\r\nbutton-hook. While she went to wipe the button-hook, Rachel bit the\r\nginger and at once cried, \xe2\x80\x9cI must spit it out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure you have really tasted it?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Allan demanded.\r\n\r\nFor answer Rachel threw it out of the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn experience anyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Allan calmly. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me see\xe2\x80\x94I have\r\nnothing else to offer you, unless you would like to taste this.\xe2\x80\x9d A\r\nsmall cupboard hung above her bed, and she took out of it a slim\r\nelegant jar filled with a bright green fluid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCr\xc3\xaame de Menthe,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cLiqueur, you know. It looks as if I\r\ndrank, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it? As a matter of fact it goes to prove what an\r\nexceptionally abstemious person I am. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had that jar for\r\nsix-and-twenty years,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, looking at it with pride, as she\r\ntipped it over, and from the height of the liquid it could be seen that\r\nthe bottle was still untouched.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-six years?\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel exclaimed.\r\n\r\nMiss Allan was gratified, for she had meant Rachel to be surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I went to Dresden six-and-twenty years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9ca certain\r\nfriend of mine announced her intention of making me a present. She\r\nthought that in the event of shipwreck or accident a stimulant might be\r\nuseful. However, as I had no occasion for it, I gave it back on my\r\nreturn. On the eve of any foreign journey the same bottle always makes\r\nits appearance, with the same note; on my return in safety it is always\r\nhanded back. I consider it a kind of charm against accidents. Though I\r\nwas once detained twenty-four hours by an accident to the train in\r\nfront of me, I have never met with any accident myself. Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued, now addressing the bottle, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have seen many climes and\r\ncupboards together, have we not? I intend one of these days to have a\r\nsilver label made with an inscription. It is a gentleman, as you may\r\nobserve, and his name is Oliver. . . . I do not think I could forgive\r\nyou, Miss Vinrace, if you broke my Oliver,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, firmly taking the\r\nbottle out of Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s hands and replacing it in the cupboard.\r\n\r\nRachel was swinging the bottle by the neck. She was interested by Miss\r\nAllan to the point of forgetting the bottle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cI do think that odd; to have had a friend for\r\ntwenty-six years, and a bottle, and\xe2\x80\x94to have made all those journeys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all; I call it the reverse of odd,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Allan replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nalways consider myself the most ordinary person I know. It\xe2\x80\x99s rather\r\ndistinguished to be as ordinary as I am. I forget\xe2\x80\x94are you a prodigy, or\r\ndid you say you were not a prodigy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled at Rachel very kindly. She seemed to have known and\r\nexperienced so much, as she moved cumbrously about the room, that\r\nsurely there must be balm for all anguish in her words, could one\r\ninduce her to have recourse to them. But Miss Allan, who was now\r\nlocking the cupboard door, showed no signs of breaking the reticence\r\nwhich had snowed her under for years. An uncomfortable sensation kept\r\nRachel silent; on the one hand, she wished to whirl high and strike a\r\nspark out of the cool pink flesh; on the other she perceived there was\r\nnothing to be done but to drift past each other in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a prodigy. I find it very difficult to say what I mean\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nobserved at length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of temperament, I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Allan helped her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are some people who have no difficulty; for myself I find there\r\nare a great many things I simply cannot say. But then I consider myself\r\nvery slow. One of my colleagues now, knows whether she likes you or\r\nnot\xe2\x80\x94let me see, how does she do it?\xe2\x80\x94by the way you say good-morning at\r\nbreakfast. It is sometimes a matter of years before I can make up my\r\nmind. But most young people seem to find it easy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Allan looked at Rachel quietly, saying nothing; she suspected that\r\nthere were difficulties of some kind. Then she put her hand to the back\r\nof her head, and discovered that one of the grey coils of hair had come\r\nloose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must ask you to be so kind as to excuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, rising, \xe2\x80\x9cif I\r\ndo my hair. I have never yet found a satisfactory type of hairpin. I\r\nmust change my dress, too, for the matter of that; and I should be\r\nparticularly glad of your assistance, because there is a tiresome set\r\nof hooks which I _can_ fasten for myself, but it takes from ten to\r\nfifteen minutes; whereas with your help\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe slipped off her coat and skirt and blouse, and stood doing her hair\r\nbefore the glass, a massive homely figure, her petticoat being so short\r\nthat she stood on a pair of thick slate-grey legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople say youth is pleasant; I myself find middle age far\r\npleasanter,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked, removing hair pins and combs, and taking up\r\nher brush. When it fell loose her hair only came down to her neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen one was young,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthings could seem so very serious\r\nif one was made that way. . . . And now my dress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a wonderfully short space of time her hair had been reformed in its\r\nusual loops. The upper half of her body now became dark green with\r\nblack stripes on it; the skirt, however, needed hooking at various\r\nangles, and Rachel had to kneel on the floor, fitting the eyes to the\r\nhooks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur Miss Johnson used to find life very unsatisfactory, I remember,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMiss Allan continued. She turned her back to the light. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then she\r\ntook to breeding guinea-pigs for their spots, and became absorbed in\r\nthat. I have just heard that the yellow guinea-pig has had a black\r\nbaby. We had a bet of sixpence on about it. She will be very\r\ntriumphant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe skirt was fastened. She looked at herself in the glass with the\r\ncurious stiffening of her face generally caused by looking in the\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I in a fit state to encounter my fellow-beings?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nforget which way it is\xe2\x80\x94but they find black animals very rarely have\r\ncoloured babies\xe2\x80\x94it may be the other way round. I have had it so often\r\nexplained to me that it is very stupid of me to have forgotten again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe moved about the room acquiring small objects with quiet force, and\r\nfixing them about her\xe2\x80\x94a locket, a watch and chain, a heavy gold\r\nbracelet, and the parti-coloured button of a suffrage society. Finally,\r\ncompletely equipped for Sunday tea, she stood before Rachel, and smiled\r\nat her kindly. She was not an impulsive woman, and her life had\r\nschooled her to restrain her tongue. At the same time, she was\r\npossessed of an amount of good-will towards others, and in particular\r\ntowards the young, which often made her regret that speech was so\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we descend?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nShe put one hand upon Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and stooping, picked up a pair\r\nof walking-shoes with the other, and placed them neatly side by side\r\noutside her door. As they walked down the passage they passed many\r\npairs of boots and shoes, some black and some brown, all side by side,\r\nand all different, even to the way in which they lay together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always think that people are so like their boots,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Allan.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is Mrs. Paley\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d but as she spoke the door opened, and Mrs.\r\nPaley rolled out in her chair, equipped also for tea.\r\n\r\nShe greeted Miss Allan and Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was just saying that people are so like their boots,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nAllan. Mrs. Paley did not hear. She repeated it more loudly still. Mrs.\r\nPaley did not hear. She repeated it a third time. Mrs. Paley heard, but\r\nshe did not understand. She was apparently about to repeat it for the\r\nfourth time, when Rachel suddenly said something inarticulate, and\r\ndisappeared down the corridor. This misunderstanding, which involved a\r\ncomplete block in the passage, seemed to her unbearable. She walked\r\nquickly and blindly in the opposite direction, and found herself at the\r\nend of a _cul de sac_. There was a window, and a table and a chair in\r\nthe window, and upon the table stood a rusty inkstand, an ashtray, an\r\nold copy of a French newspaper, and a pen with a broken nib. Rachel sat\r\ndown, as if to study the French newspaper, but a tear fell on the\r\nblurred French print, raising a soft blot. She lifted her head sharply,\r\nexclaiming aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s intolerable!\xe2\x80\x9d Looking out of the window with\r\neyes that would have seen nothing even had they not been dazed by\r\ntears, she indulged herself at last in violent abuse of the entire day.\r\nIt had been miserable from start to finish; first, the service in the\r\nchapel; then luncheon; then Evelyn; then Miss Allan; then old Mrs.\r\nPaley blocking up the passage. All day long she had been tantalized and\r\nput off. She had now reached one of those eminences, the result of some\r\ncrisis, from which the world is finally displayed in its true\r\nproportions. She disliked the look of it immensely\xe2\x80\x94churches,\r\npoliticians, misfits, and huge impostures\xe2\x80\x94men like Mr. Dalloway, men\r\nlike Mr. Bax, Evelyn and her chatter, Mrs. Paley blocking up the\r\npassage. Meanwhile the steady beat of her own pulse represented the hot\r\ncurrent of feeling that ran down beneath; beating, struggling,\r\nfretting. For the time, her own body was the source of all the life in\r\nthe world, which tried to burst forth here\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x94and was repressed now\r\nby Mr. Bax, now by Evelyn, now by the imposition of ponderous\r\nstupidity, the weight of the entire world. Thus tormented, she would\r\ntwist her hands together, for all things were wrong, all people stupid.\r\nVaguely seeing that there were people down in the garden beneath she\r\nrepresented them as aimless masses of matter, floating hither and\r\nthither, without aim except to impede her. What were they doing, those\r\nother people in the world?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody knows,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. The force of her rage was beginning to spend\r\nitself, and the vision of the world which had been so vivid became dim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a dream,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. She considered the rusty inkstand, the\r\npen, the ash-tray, and the old French newspaper. These small and\r\nworthless objects seemed to her to represent human lives.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re asleep and dreaming,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. But the possibility which\r\nnow suggested itself that one of the shapes might be the shape of\r\nTerence roused her from her melancholy lethargy. She became as restless\r\nas she had been before she sat down. She was no longer able to see the\r\nworld as a town laid out beneath her. It was covered instead by a haze\r\nof feverish red mist. She had returned to the state in which she had\r\nbeen all day. Thinking was no escape. Physical movement was the only\r\nrefuge, in and out of rooms, in and out of people\xe2\x80\x99s minds, seeking she\r\nknew not what. Therefore she rose, pushed back the table, and went\r\ndownstairs. She went out of the hall door, and, turning the corner of\r\nthe hotel, found herself among the people whom she had seen from the\r\nwindow. But owing to the broad sunshine after shaded passages, and to\r\nthe substance of living people after dreams, the group appeared with\r\nstartling intensity, as though the dusty surface had been peeled off\r\neverything, leaving only the reality and the instant. It had the look\r\nof a vision printed on the dark at night. White and grey and purple\r\nfigures were scattered on the green, round wicker tables, in the middle\r\nthe flame of the tea-urn made the air waver like a faulty sheet of\r\nglass, a massive green tree stood over them as if it were a moving\r\nforce held at rest. As she approached, she could hear Evelyn\xe2\x80\x99s voice\r\nrepeating monotonously, \xe2\x80\x9cHere then\xe2\x80\x94here\xe2\x80\x94good doggie, come here\xe2\x80\x9d; for a\r\nmoment nothing seemed to happen; it all stood still, and then she\r\nrealised that one of the figures was Helen Ambrose; and the dust again\r\nbegan to settle.\r\n\r\nThe group indeed had come together in a miscellaneous way; one\r\ntea-table joining to another tea-table, and deck-chairs serving to\r\nconnect two groups. But even at a distance it could be seen that Mrs.\r\nFlushing, upright and imperious, dominated the party. She was talking\r\nvehemently to Helen across the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen days under canvas,\xe2\x80\x9d she was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cNo comforts. If you want\r\ncomforts, don\xe2\x80\x99t come. But I may tell you, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t come you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nregret it all your life. You say yes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment Mrs. Flushing caught sight of Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there\xe2\x80\x99s your niece. She\xe2\x80\x99s promised. You\xe2\x80\x99re coming, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHaving adopted the plan, she pursued it with the energy of a child.\r\n\r\nRachel took her part with eagerness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I\xe2\x80\x99m coming. So are you, Helen. And Mr. Pepper too.\xe2\x80\x9d As she\r\nsat she realised that she was surrounded by people she knew, but that\r\nTerence was not among them. From various angles people began saying\r\nwhat they thought of the proposed expedition. According to some it\r\nwould be hot, but the nights would be cold; according to others, the\r\ndifficulties would lie rather in getting a boat, and in speaking the\r\nlanguage. Mrs. Flushing disposed of all objections, whether due to man\r\nor due to nature, by announcing that her husband would settle all that.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Flushing quietly explained to Helen that the expedition\r\nwas really a simple matter; it took five days at the outside; and the\r\nplace\xe2\x80\x94a native village\xe2\x80\x94was certainly well worth seeing before she\r\nreturned to England. Helen murmured ambiguously, and did not commit\r\nherself to one answer rather than to another.\r\n\r\nThe tea-party, however, included too many different kinds of people for\r\ngeneral conversation to flourish; and from Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s point of view\r\npossessed the great advantage that it was quite unnecessary for her to\r\ntalk. Over there Susan and Arthur were explaining to Mrs. Paley that an\r\nexpedition had been proposed; and Mrs. Paley having grasped the fact,\r\ngave the advice of an old traveller that they should take nice canned\r\nvegetables, fur cloaks, and insect powder. She leant over to Mrs.\r\nFlushing and whispered something which from the twinkle in her eyes\r\nprobably had reference to bugs. Then Helen was reciting \xe2\x80\x9cToll for the\r\nBrave\xe2\x80\x9d to St. John Hirst, in order apparently to win a sixpence which\r\nlay upon the table; while Mr. Hughling Elliot imposed silence upon his\r\nsection of the audience by his fascinating anecdote of Lord Curzon and\r\nthe undergraduate\xe2\x80\x99s bicycle. Mrs. Thornbury was trying to remember the\r\nname of a man who might have been another Garibaldi, and had written a\r\nbook which they ought to read; and Mr. Thornbury recollected that he\r\nhad a pair of binoculars at anybody\xe2\x80\x99s service. Miss Allan meanwhile\r\nmurmured with the curious intimacy which a spinster often achieves with\r\ndogs, to the fox-terrier which Evelyn had at last induced to come over\r\nto them. Little particles of dust or blossom fell on the plates now and\r\nthen when the branches sighed above. Rachel seemed to see and hear a\r\nlittle of everything, much as a river feels the twigs that fall into it\r\nand sees the sky above, but her eyes were too vague for Evelyn\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nliking. She came across, and sat on the ground at Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you thinking about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Warrington,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel replied rashly, because she had to say\r\nsomething. She did indeed see Susan murmuring to Mrs. Elliot, while\r\nArthur stared at her with complete confidence in his own love. Both\r\nRachel and Evelyn then began to listen to what Susan was saying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the ordering and the dogs and the garden, and the children\r\ncoming to be taught,\xe2\x80\x9d her voice proceeded rhythmically as if checking\r\nthe list, \xe2\x80\x9cand my tennis, and the village, and letters to write for\r\nfather, and a thousand little things that don\xe2\x80\x99t sound much; but I never\r\nhave a moment to myself, and when I go to bed, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sleepy I\xe2\x80\x99m off\r\nbefore my head touches the pillow. Besides I like to be a great deal\r\nwith my Aunts\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m a great bore, aren\xe2\x80\x99t I, Aunt Emma?\xe2\x80\x9d (she smiled at\r\nold Mrs. Paley, who with head slightly drooped was regarding the cake\r\nwith speculative affection), \xe2\x80\x9cand father has to be very careful about\r\nchills in winter which means a great deal of running about, because he\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t look after himself, any more than you will, Arthur! So it all\r\nmounts up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice mounted too, in a mild ecstasy of satisfaction with her life\r\nand her own nature. Rachel suddenly took a violent dislike to Susan,\r\nignoring all that was kindly, modest, and even pathetic about her. She\r\nappeared insincere and cruel; she saw her grown stout and prolific, the\r\nkind blue eyes now shallow and watery, the bloom of the cheeks\r\ncongealed to a network of dry red canals.\r\n\r\nHelen turned to her. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you go to church?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. She had won her\r\nsixpence and seemed making ready to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the last time,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\nIn preparing to put on her gloves, Helen dropped one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not going?\xe2\x80\x9d Evelyn asked, taking hold of one glove as if to\r\nkeep them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s high time we went,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see how silent every\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s getting\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA silence had fallen upon them all, caused partly by one of the\r\naccidents of talk, and partly because they saw some one approaching.\r\nHelen could not see who it was, but keeping her eyes fixed upon Rachel\r\nobserved something which made her say to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cSo it\xe2\x80\x99s Hewet.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\ndrew on her gloves with a curious sense of the significance of the\r\nmoment. Then she rose, for Mrs. Flushing had seen Hewet too, and was\r\ndemanding information about rivers and boats which showed that the\r\nwhole conversation would now come over again.\r\n\r\nRachel followed her, and they walked in silence down the avenue. In\r\nspite of what Helen had seen and understood, the feeling that was\r\nuppermost in her mind was now curiously perverse; if she went on this\r\nexpedition, she would not be able to have a bath, the effort appeared\r\nto her to be great and disagreeable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so unpleasant, being cooped up with people one hardly knows,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nremarked. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople who mind being seen naked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to go?\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel asked.\r\n\r\nThe intensity with which this was spoken irritated Mrs. Ambrose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to go, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean not to go,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. She\r\nbecame more and more casual and indifferent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, I daresay we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen all there is to be seen; and there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe bother of getting there, and whatever they may say it\xe2\x80\x99s bound to be\r\nvilely uncomfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor some time Rachel made no reply; but every sentence Helen spoke\r\nincreased her bitterness. At last she broke out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God, Helen, I\xe2\x80\x99m not like you! I sometimes think you don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nor feel or care to do anything but exist! You\xe2\x80\x99re like Mr. Hirst. You\r\nsee that things are bad, and you pride yourself on saying so. It\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nyou call being honest; as a matter of fact it\xe2\x80\x99s being lazy, being dull,\r\nbeing nothing. You don\xe2\x80\x99t help; you put an end to things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHelen smiled as if she rather enjoyed the attack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d she enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me bad\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite likely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen.\r\n\r\nAt any other time Rachel would probably have been silenced by her\r\nAunt\xe2\x80\x99s candour; but this afternoon she was not in the mood to be\r\nsilenced by any one. A quarrel would be welcome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re only half alive,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t accept Mr. Flushing\xe2\x80\x99s invitation?\xe2\x80\x9d Helen\r\nasked, \xe2\x80\x9cor do you always think that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the moment it appeared to Rachel that she had always seen the same\r\nfaults in Helen, from the very first night on board the _Euphrosyne_,\r\nin spite of her beauty, in spite of her magnanimity and their love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s only what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with every one!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\r\none feels\xe2\x80\x94no one does anything but hurt. I tell you, Helen, the world\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbad. It\xe2\x80\x99s an agony, living, wanting\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere she tore a handful of leaves from a bush and crushed them to\r\ncontrol herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lives of these people,\xe2\x80\x9d she tried to explain, \xe2\x80\x9cthe aimlessness,\r\nthe way they live. One goes from one to another, and it\xe2\x80\x99s all the same.\r\nOne never gets what one wants out of any of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer emotional state and her confusion would have made her an easy prey\r\nif Helen had wished to argue or had wished to draw confidences. But\r\ninstead of talking she fell into a profound silence as they walked on.\r\nAimless, trivial, meaningless, oh no\xe2\x80\x94what she had seen at tea made it\r\nimpossible for her to believe that. The little jokes, the chatter, the\r\ninanities of the afternoon had shrivelled up before her eyes.\r\nUnderneath the likings and spites, the comings together and partings,\r\ngreat things were happening\xe2\x80\x94terrible things, because they were so\r\ngreat. Her sense of safety was shaken, as if beneath twigs and dead\r\nleaves she had seen the movement of a snake. It seemed to her that a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s respite was allowed, a moment\xe2\x80\x99s make-believe, and then again\r\nthe profound and reasonless law asserted itself, moulding them all to\r\nits liking, making and destroying.\r\n\r\nShe looked at Rachel walking beside her, still crushing the leaves in\r\nher fingers and absorbed in her own thoughts. She was in love, and she\r\npitied her profoundly. But she roused herself from these thoughts and\r\napologised. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut if I\xe2\x80\x99m dull, it\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nnature, and it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped.\xe2\x80\x9d If it was a natural defect, however,\r\nshe found an easy remedy, for she went on to say that she thought Mr.\r\nFlushing\xe2\x80\x99s scheme a very good one, only needing a little consideration,\r\nwhich it appeared she had given it by the time they reached home. By\r\nthat time they had settled that if anything more was said, they would\r\naccept the invitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen considered in detail by Mr. Flushing and Mrs. Ambrose the\r\nexpedition proved neither dangerous nor difficult. They found also that\r\nit was not even unusual. Every year at this season English people made\r\nparties which steamed a short way up the river, landed, and looked at\r\nthe native village, bought a certain number of things from the natives,\r\nand returned again without damage done to mind or body. When it was\r\ndiscovered that six people really wished the same thing the\r\narrangements were soon carried out.\r\n\r\nSince the time of Elizabeth very few people had seen the river, and\r\nnothing has been done to change its appearance from what it was to the\r\neyes of the Elizabethan voyagers. The time of Elizabeth was only\r\ndistant from the present time by a moment of space compared with the\r\nages which had passed since the water had run between those banks, and\r\nthe green thickets swarmed there, and the small trees had grown to huge\r\nwrinkled trees in solitude. Changing only with the change of the sun\r\nand the clouds, the waving green mass had stood there for century after\r\ncentury, and the water had run between its banks ceaselessly, sometimes\r\nwashing away earth and sometimes the branches of trees, while in other\r\nparts of the world one town had risen upon the ruins of another town,\r\nand the men in the towns had become more and more articulate and unlike\r\neach other. A few miles of this river were visible from the top of the\r\nmountain where some weeks before the party from the hotel had\r\npicnicked. Susan and Arthur had seen it as they kissed each other, and\r\nTerence and Rachel as they sat talking about Richmond, and Evelyn and\r\nPerrott as they strolled about, imagining that they were great captains\r\nsent to colonise the world. They had seen the broad blue mark across\r\nthe sand where it flowed into the sea, and the green cloud of trees\r\nmass themselves about it farther up, and finally hide its waters\r\naltogether from sight. At intervals for the first twenty miles or so\r\nhouses were scattered on the bank; by degrees the houses became huts,\r\nand, later still, there was neither hut nor house, but trees and grass,\r\nwhich were seen only by hunters, explorers, or merchants, marching or\r\nsailing, but making no settlement.\r\n\r\nBy leaving Santa Marina early in the morning, driving twenty miles and\r\nriding eight, the party, which was composed finally of six English\r\npeople, reached the river-side as the night fell. They came cantering\r\nthrough the trees\xe2\x80\x94Mr. and Mrs. Flushing, Helen Ambrose, Rachel,\r\nTerence, and St. John. The tired little horses then stopped\r\nautomatically, and the English dismounted. Mrs. Flushing strode to the\r\nriver-bank in high spirits. The day had been long and hot, but she had\r\nenjoyed the speed and the open air; she had left the hotel which she\r\nhated, and she found the company to her liking. The river was swirling\r\npast in the darkness; they could just distinguish the smooth moving\r\nsurface of the water, and the air was full of the sound of it. They\r\nstood in an empty space in the midst of great tree-trunks, and out\r\nthere a little green light moving slightly up and down showed them\r\nwhere the steamer lay in which they were to embark.\r\n\r\nWhen they all stood upon its deck they found that it was a very small\r\nboat which throbbed gently beneath them for a few minutes, and then\r\nshoved smoothly through the water. They seemed to be driving into the\r\nheart of the night, for the trees closed in front of them, and they\r\ncould hear all round them the rustling of leaves. The great darkness\r\nhad the usual effect of taking away all desire for communication by\r\nmaking their words sound thin and small; and, after walking round the\r\ndeck three or four times, they clustered together, yawning deeply, and\r\nlooking at the same spot of deep gloom on the banks. Murmuring very low\r\nin the rhythmical tone of one oppressed by the air, Mrs. Flushing began\r\nto wonder where they were to sleep, for they could not sleep\r\ndownstairs, they could not sleep in a doghole smelling of oil, they\r\ncould not sleep on deck, they could not sleep\xe2\x80\x94She yawned profoundly. It\r\nwas as Helen had foreseen; the question of nakedness had risen already,\r\nalthough they were half asleep, and almost invisible to each other.\r\nWith St. John\xe2\x80\x99s help she stretched an awning, and persuaded Mrs.\r\nFlushing that she could take off her clothes behind this, and that no\r\none would notice if by chance some part of her which had been concealed\r\nfor forty-five years was laid bare to the human eye. Mattresses were\r\nthrown down, rugs provided, and the three women lay near each other in\r\nthe soft open air.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen, having smoked a certain number of cigarettes, dropped\r\nthe glowing ends into the river, and looked for a time at the ripples\r\nwrinkling the black water beneath them, undressed too, and lay down at\r\nthe other end of the boat. They were very tired, and curtained from\r\neach other by the darkness. The light from one lantern fell upon a few\r\nropes, a few planks of the deck, and the rail of the boat, but beyond\r\nthat there was unbroken darkness, no light reached their faces, or the\r\ntrees which were massed on the sides of the river.\r\n\r\nSoon Wilfrid Flushing slept, and Hirst slept. Hewet alone lay awake\r\nlooking straight up into the sky. The gentle motion and the black\r\nshapes that were drawn ceaselessly across his eyes had the effect of\r\nmaking it impossible for him to think. Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s presence so near him\r\nlulled thought asleep. Being so near him, only a few paces off at the\r\nother end of the boat, she made it as impossible for him to think about\r\nher as it would have been impossible to see her if she had stood quite\r\nclose to him, her forehead against his forehead. In some strange way\r\nthe boat became identified with himself, and just as it would have been\r\nuseless for him to get up and steer the boat, so was it useless for him\r\nto struggle any longer with the irresistible force of his own feelings.\r\nHe was drawn on and on away from all he knew, slipping over barriers\r\nand past landmarks into unknown waters as the boat glided over the\r\nsmooth surface of the river. In profound peace, enveloped in deeper\r\nunconsciousness than had been his for many nights, he lay on deck\r\nwatching the tree-tops change their position slightly against the sky,\r\nand arch themselves, and sink and tower huge, until he passed from\r\nseeing them into dreams where he lay beneath the shadow of the vast\r\ntrees, looking up into the sky.\r\n\r\nWhen they woke next morning they had gone a considerable way up the\r\nriver; on the right was a high yellow bank of sand tufted with trees,\r\non the left a swamp quivering with long reeds and tall bamboos on the\r\ntop of which, swaying slightly, perched vivid green and yellow birds.\r\nThe morning was hot and still. After breakfast they drew chairs\r\ntogether and sat in an irregular semicircle in the bow. An awning above\r\ntheir heads protected them from the heat of the sun, and the breeze\r\nwhich the boat made aired them softly. Mrs. Flushing was already\r\ndotting and striping her canvas, her head jerking this way and that\r\nwith the action of a bird nervously picking up grain; the others had\r\nbooks or pieces of paper or embroidery on their knees, at which they\r\nlooked fitfully and again looked at the river ahead. At one point Hewet\r\nread part of a poem aloud, but the number of moving things entirely\r\nvanquished his words. He ceased to read, and no one spoke. They moved\r\non under the shelter of the trees. There was now a covey of red birds\r\nfeeding on one of the little islets to the left, or again a blue-green\r\nparrot flew shrieking from tree to tree. As they moved on the country\r\ngrew wilder and wilder. The trees and the undergrowth seemed to be\r\nstrangling each other near the ground in a multitudinous wrestle; while\r\nhere and there a splendid tree towered high above the swarm, shaking\r\nits thin green umbrellas lightly in the upper air. Hewet looked at his\r\nbooks again. The morning was peaceful as the night had been, only it\r\nwas very strange because he could see it was light, and he could see\r\nRachel and hear her voice and be near to her. He felt as if he were\r\nwaiting, as if somehow he were stationary among things that passed over\r\nhim and around him, voices, people\xe2\x80\x99s bodies, birds, only Rachel too was\r\nwaiting with him. He looked at her sometimes as if she must know that\r\nthey were waiting together, and being drawn on together, without being\r\nable to offer any resistance. Again he read from his book:\r\n\r\nWhoever you are holding me now in your hand,\r\nWithout one thing all will be useless.\r\n\r\n\r\nA bird gave a wild laugh, a monkey chuckled a malicious question, and,\r\nas fire fades in the hot sunshine, his words flickered and went out.\r\n\r\nBy degrees as the river narrowed, and the high sandbanks fell to level\r\nground thickly grown with trees, the sounds of the forest could be\r\nheard. It echoed like a hall. There were sudden cries; and then long\r\nspaces of silence, such as there are in a cathedral when a boy\xe2\x80\x99s voice\r\nhas ceased and the echo of it still seems to haunt about the remote\r\nplaces of the roof. Once Mr. Flushing rose and spoke to a sailor, and\r\neven announced that some time after luncheon the steamer would stop,\r\nand they could walk a little way through the forest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are tracks all through the trees there,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re no\r\ndistance from civilisation yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe scrutinised his wife\xe2\x80\x99s painting. Too polite to praise it openly, he\r\ncontented himself with cutting off one half of the picture with one\r\nhand, and giving a flourish in the air with the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod!\xe2\x80\x9d Hirst exclaimed, staring straight ahead. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\namazingly beautiful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful?\xe2\x80\x9d Helen enquired. It seemed a strange little word, and Hirst\r\nand herself both so small that she forgot to answer him.\r\n\r\nHewet felt that he must speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where the Elizabethans got their style,\xe2\x80\x9d he mused, staring into\r\nthe profusion of leaves and blossoms and prodigious fruits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShakespeare? I hate Shakespeare!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Flushing exclaimed; and Wilfrid\r\nreturned admiringly, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe you\xe2\x80\x99re the only person who dares to say\r\nthat, Alice.\xe2\x80\x9d But Mrs. Flushing went on painting. She did not appear to\r\nattach much value to her husband\xe2\x80\x99s compliment, and painted steadily,\r\nsometimes muttering a half-audible word or groan.\r\n\r\nThe morning was now very hot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at Hirst!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Flushing whispered. His sheet of paper had slipped\r\non to the deck, his head lay back, and he drew a long snoring breath.\r\n\r\nTerence picked up the sheet of paper and spread it out before Rachel.\r\nIt was a continuation of the poem on God which he had begun in the\r\nchapel, and it was so indecent that Rachel did not understand half of\r\nit although she saw that it was indecent. Hewet began to fill in words\r\nwhere Hirst had left spaces, but he soon ceased; his pencil rolled on\r\ndeck. Gradually they approached nearer and nearer to the bank on the\r\nright-hand side, so that the light which covered them became definitely\r\ngreen, falling through a shade of green leaves, and Mrs. Flushing set\r\naside her sketch and stared ahead of her in silence. Hirst woke up;\r\nthey were then called to luncheon, and while they ate it, the steamer\r\ncame to a standstill a little way out from the bank. The boat which was\r\ntowed behind them was brought to the side, and the ladies were helped\r\ninto it.\r\n\r\nFor protection against boredom, Helen put a book of memoirs beneath her\r\narm, and Mrs. Flushing her paint-box, and, thus equipped, they allowed\r\nthemselves to be set on shore on the verge of the forest.\r\n\r\nThey had not strolled more than a few hundred yards along the track\r\nwhich ran parallel with the river before Helen professed to find it was\r\nunbearably hot. The river breeze had ceased, and a hot steamy\r\natmosphere, thick with scents, came from the forest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall sit down here,\xe2\x80\x9d she announced, pointing to the trunk of a tree\r\nwhich had fallen long ago and was now laced across and across by\r\ncreepers and thong-like brambles. She seated herself, opened her\r\nparasol, and looked at the river which was barred by the stems of\r\ntrees. She turned her back to the trees which disappeared in black\r\nshadow behind her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite agree,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Flushing, and proceeded to undo her\r\npaint-box. Her husband strolled about to select an interesting point of\r\nview for her. Hirst cleared a space on the ground by Helen\xe2\x80\x99s side, and\r\nseated himself with great deliberation, as if he did not mean to move\r\nuntil he had talked to her for a long time. Terence and Rachel were\r\nleft standing by themselves without occupation. Terence saw that the\r\ntime had come as it was fated to come, but although he realised this he\r\nwas completely calm and master of himself. He chose to stand for a few\r\nmoments talking to Helen, and persuading her to leave her seat. Rachel\r\njoined him too in advising her to come with them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf all the people I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever met,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re the least\r\nadventurous. You might be sitting on green chairs in Hyde Park. Are you\r\ngoing to sit there the whole afternoon? Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you going to walk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen, \xe2\x80\x9cone\xe2\x80\x99s only got to use one\xe2\x80\x99s eye. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neverything here\xe2\x80\x94everything,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated in a drowsy tone of voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you gain by walking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be hot and disagreeable by tea-time, we shall be cool and\r\nsweet,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Hirst. Into his eyes as he looked up at them had come\r\nyellow and green reflections from the sky and the branches, robbing\r\nthem of their intentness, and he seemed to think what he did not say.\r\nIt was thus taken for granted by them both that Terence and Rachel\r\nproposed to walk into the woods together; with one look at each other\r\nthey turned away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by. Beware of snakes,\xe2\x80\x9d Hirst replied. He settled himself still\r\nmore comfortably under the shade of the fallen tree and Helen\xe2\x80\x99s figure.\r\nAs they went, Mr. Flushing called after them, \xe2\x80\x9cWe must start in an\r\nhour. Hewet, please remember that. An hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhether made by man, or for some reason preserved by nature, there was\r\na wide pathway striking through the forest at right angles to the\r\nriver. It resembled a drive in an English forest, save that tropical\r\nbushes with their sword-like leaves grew at the side, and the ground\r\nwas covered with an unmarked springy moss instead of grass, starred\r\nwith little yellow flowers. As they passed into the depths of the\r\nforest the light grew dimmer, and the noises of the ordinary world were\r\nreplaced by those creaking and sighing sounds which suggest to the\r\ntraveller in a forest that he is walking at the bottom of the sea. The\r\npath narrowed and turned; it was hedged in by dense creepers which\r\nknotted tree to tree, and burst here and there into star-shaped crimson\r\nblossoms. The sighing and creaking up above were broken every now and\r\nthen by the jarring cry of some startled animal. The atmosphere was\r\nclose and the air came at them in languid puffs of scent. The vast\r\ngreen light was broken here and there by a round of pure yellow\r\nsunlight which fell through some gap in the immense umbrella of green\r\nabove, and in these yellow spaces crimson and black butterflies were\r\ncircling and settling. Terence and Rachel hardly spoke.\r\n\r\nNot only did the silence weigh upon them, but they were both unable to\r\nframe any thoughts. There was something between them which had to be\r\nspoken of. One of them had to begin, but which of them was it to be?\r\nThen Hewet picked up a red fruit and threw it as high as he could. When\r\nit dropped, he would speak. They heard the flapping of great wings;\r\nthey heard the fruit go pattering through the leaves and eventually\r\nfall with a thud. The silence was again profound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes this frighten you?\xe2\x80\x9d Terence asked when the sound of the fruit\r\nfalling had completely died away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe repeated \xe2\x80\x9cI like it.\xe2\x80\x9d She was walking fast, and holding herself\r\nmore erect than usual. There was another pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou like being with me?\xe2\x80\x9d Terence asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, with you,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a moment. Silence seemed to have fallen upon the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I have felt ever since I knew you,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are\r\nhappy together.\xe2\x80\x9d He did not seem to be speaking, or she to be hearing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery happy,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\nThey continued to walk for some time in silence. Their steps\r\nunconsciously quickened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe love each other,\xe2\x80\x9d Terence said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe love each other,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\nThe silence was then broken by their voices which joined in tones of\r\nstrange unfamiliar sound which formed no words. Faster and faster they\r\nwalked; simultaneously they stopped, clasped each other in their arms,\r\nthen releasing themselves, dropped to the earth. They sat side by side.\r\nSounds stood out from the background making a bridge across their\r\nsilence; they heard the swish of the trees and some beast croaking in a\r\nremote world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe love each other,\xe2\x80\x9d Terence repeated, searching into her face. Their\r\nfaces were both very pale and quiet, and they said nothing. He was\r\nafraid to kiss her again. By degrees she drew close to him, and rested\r\nagainst him. In this position they sat for some time. She said\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTerence\xe2\x80\x9d once; he answered \xe2\x80\x9cRachel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTerrible\xe2\x80\x94terrible,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured after another pause, but in saying\r\nthis she was thinking as much of the persistent churning of the water\r\nas of her own feeling. On and on it went in the distance, the senseless\r\nand cruel churning of the water. She observed that the tears were\r\nrunning down Terence\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks.\r\n\r\nThe next movement was on his part. A very long time seemed to have\r\npassed. He took out his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlushing said an hour. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been gone more than half an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it takes that to get back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel. She raised herself very\r\nslowly. When she was standing up she stretched her arms and drew a deep\r\nbreath, half a sigh, half a yawn. She appeared to be very tired. Her\r\ncheeks were white. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich way?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Terence.\r\n\r\nThey began to walk back down the mossy path again. The sighing and\r\ncreaking continued far overhead, and the jarring cries of animals. The\r\nbutterflies were circling still in the patches of yellow sunlight. At\r\nfirst Terence was certain of his way, but as they walked he became\r\ndoubtful. They had to stop to consider, and then to return and start\r\nonce more, for although he was certain of the direction of the river he\r\nwas not certain of striking the point where they had left the others.\r\nRachel followed him, stopping where he stopped, turning where he\r\nturned, ignorant of the way, ignorant why he stopped or why he turned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be late,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He put a flower into her\r\nhand and her fingers closed upon it quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re so late\xe2\x80\x94so late\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nhorribly late,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated as if he were talking in his sleep.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94this is right. We turn here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey found themselves again in the broad path, like the drive in the\r\nEnglish forest, where they had started when they left the others. They\r\nwalked on in silence as people walking in their sleep, and were oddly\r\nconscious now and again of the mass of their bodies. Then Rachel\r\nexclaimed suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cHelen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the sunny space at the edge of the forest they saw Helen still\r\nsitting on the tree-trunk, her dress showing very white in the sun,\r\nwith Hirst still propped on his elbow by her side. They stopped\r\ninstinctively. At the sight of other people they could not go on. They\r\nstood hand in hand for a minute or two in silence. They could not bear\r\nto face other people.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we must go on,\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel insisted at last, in the curious dull tone\r\nof voice in which they had both been speaking, and with a great effort\r\nthey forced themselves to cover the short distance which lay between\r\nthem and the pair sitting on the tree-trunk.\r\n\r\nAs they approached, Helen turned round and looked at them. She looked\r\nat them for some time without speaking, and when they were close to her\r\nshe said quietly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you meet Mr. Flushing? He has gone to find you. He thought you\r\nmust be lost, though I told him you weren\xe2\x80\x99t lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHirst half turned round and threw his head back so that he looked at\r\nthe branches crossing themselves in the air above him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, was it worth the effort?\xe2\x80\x9d he enquired dreamily.\r\n\r\nHewet sat down on the grass by his side and began to fan himself.\r\n\r\nRachel had balanced herself near Helen on the end of the tree trunk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery hot,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look exhausted anyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s fearfully close in those trees,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen remarked, picking up her\r\nbook and shaking it free from the dried blades of grass which had\r\nfallen between the leaves. Then they were all silent, looking at the\r\nriver swirling past in front of them between the trunks of the trees\r\nuntil Mr. Flushing interrupted them. He broke out of the trees a\r\nhundred yards to the left, exclaiming sharply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, so you found the way after all. But it\xe2\x80\x99s late\xe2\x80\x94much later than we\r\narranged, Hewet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was slightly annoyed, and in his capacity as leader of the\r\nexpedition, inclined to be dictatorial. He spoke quickly, using\r\ncuriously sharp, meaningless words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeing late wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t matter normally, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut when\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a question of keeping the men up to time\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gathered them together and made them come down to the river-bank,\r\nwhere the boat was waiting to row them out to the steamer.\r\n\r\nThe heat of the day was going down, and over their cups of tea the\r\nFlushings tended to become communicative. It seemed to Terence as he\r\nlistened to them talking, that existence now went on in two different\r\nlayers. Here were the Flushings talking, talking somewhere high up in\r\nthe air above him, and he and Rachel had dropped to the bottom of the\r\nworld together. But with something of a child\xe2\x80\x99s directness, Mrs.\r\nFlushing had also the instinct which leads a child to suspect what its\r\nelders wish to keep hidden. She fixed Terence with her vivid blue eyes\r\nand addressed herself to him in particular. What would he do, she\r\nwanted to know, if the boat ran upon a rock and sank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you care for anythin\xe2\x80\x99 but savin\xe2\x80\x99 yourself? Should I? No, no,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cnot one scrap\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me. There\xe2\x80\x99s only two creatures\r\nthe ordinary woman cares about,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cher child and her dog;\r\nand I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s even two with men. One reads a lot about\r\nlove\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s why poetry\xe2\x80\x99s so dull. But what happens in real life, eh? It\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t love!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\nTerence murmured something unintelligible. Mr. Flushing, however, had\r\nrecovered his urbanity. He was smoking a cigarette, and he now answered\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must always remember, Alice,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your upbringing was\r\nvery unnatural\xe2\x80\x94unusual, I should say. They had no mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexplained, dropping something of the formality of his tone; \xe2\x80\x9cand a\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x94he was a very delightful man, I\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt, but he cared only\r\nfor racehorses and Greek statues. Tell them about the bath, Alice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the stable-yard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Flushing. \xe2\x80\x9cCovered with ice in winter.\r\nWe had to get in; if we didn\xe2\x80\x99t, we were whipped. The strong ones\r\nlived\xe2\x80\x94the others died. What you call survival of the fittest\xe2\x80\x94a most\r\nexcellent plan, I daresay, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve thirteen children!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all this going on in the heart of England, in the nineteenth\r\ncentury!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Flushing exclaimed, turning to Helen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d treat my children just the same if I had any,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Flushing.\r\n\r\nEvery word sounded quite distinctly in Terence\xe2\x80\x99s ears; but what were\r\nthey saying, and who were they talking to, and who were they, these\r\nfantastic people, detached somewhere high up in the air? Now that they\r\nhad drunk their tea, they rose and leant over the bow of the boat. The\r\nsun was going down, and the water was dark and crimson. The river had\r\nwidened again, and they were passing a little island set like a dark\r\nwedge in the middle of the stream. Two great white birds with red\r\nlights on them stood there on stilt-like legs, and the beach of the\r\nisland was unmarked, save by the skeleton print of birds\xe2\x80\x99 feet. The\r\nbranches of the trees on the bank looked more twisted and angular than\r\never, and the green of the leaves was lurid and splashed with gold.\r\nThen Hirst began to talk, leaning over the bow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt makes one awfully queer, don\xe2\x80\x99t you find?\xe2\x80\x9d he complained. \xe2\x80\x9cThese\r\ntrees get on one\xe2\x80\x99s nerves\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s all so crazy. God\xe2\x80\x99s undoubtedly mad.\r\nWhat sane person could have conceived a wilderness like this, and\r\npeopled it with apes and alligators? I should go mad if I lived\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x94raving mad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTerence attempted to answer him, but Mrs. Ambrose replied instead. She\r\nbade him look at the way things massed themselves\xe2\x80\x94look at the amazing\r\ncolours, look at the shapes of the trees. She seemed to be protecting\r\nTerence from the approach of the others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Flushing. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd in my opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nabsence of population to which Hirst objects is precisely the\r\nsignificant touch. You must admit, Hirst, that a little Italian town\r\neven would vulgarise the whole scene, would detract from the\r\nvastness\xe2\x80\x94the sense of elemental grandeur.\xe2\x80\x9d He swept his hands towards\r\nthe forest, and paused for a moment, looking at the great green mass,\r\nwhich was now falling silent. \xe2\x80\x9cI own it makes us seem pretty small\xe2\x80\x94us,\r\nnot them.\xe2\x80\x9d He nodded his head at a sailor who leant over the side\r\nspitting into the river. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that, I think, is what my wife feels, the\r\nessential superiority of the peasant\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Under cover of Mr. Flushing\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwords, which continued now gently reasoning with St. John and\r\npersuading him, Terence drew Rachel to the side, pointing ostensibly to\r\na great gnarled tree-trunk which had fallen and lay half in the water.\r\nHe wished, at any rate, to be near her, but he found that he could say\r\nnothing. They could hear Mr. Flushing flowing on, now about his wife,\r\nnow about art, now about the future of the country, little meaningless\r\nwords floating high in air. As it was becoming cold he began to pace\r\nthe deck with Hirst. Fragments of their talk came out distinctly as\r\nthey passed\xe2\x80\x94art, emotion, truth, reality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it true, or is it a dream?\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel murmured, when they had passed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true, it\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\r\nBut the breeze freshened, and there was a general desire for movement.\r\nWhen the party rearranged themselves under cover of rugs and cloaks,\r\nTerence and Rachel were at opposite ends of the circle, and could not\r\nspeak to each other. But as the dark descended, the words of the others\r\nseemed to curl up and vanish as the ashes of burnt paper, and left them\r\nsitting perfectly silent at the bottom of the world. Occasional starts\r\nof exquisite joy ran through them, and then they were peaceful again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to Mr. Flushing\xe2\x80\x99s discipline, the right stages of the river were\r\nreached at the right hours, and when next morning after breakfast the\r\nchairs were again drawn out in a semicircle in the bow, the launch was\r\nwithin a few miles of the native camp which was the limit of the\r\njourney. Mr. Flushing, as he sat down, advised them to keep their eyes\r\nfixed on the left bank, where they would soon pass a clearing, and in\r\nthat clearing, was a hut where Mackenzie, the famous explorer, had died\r\nof fever some ten years ago, almost within reach of\r\ncivilisation\xe2\x80\x94Mackenzie, he repeated, the man who went farther inland\r\nthan any one\xe2\x80\x99s been yet. Their eyes turned that way obediently. The\r\neyes of Rachel saw nothing. Yellow and green shapes did, it is true,\r\npass before them, but she only knew that one was large and another\r\nsmall; she did not know that they were trees. These directions to look\r\nhere and there irritated her, as interruptions irritate a person\r\nabsorbed in thought, although she was not thinking of anything. She was\r\nannoyed with all that was said, and with the aimless movements of\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s bodies, because they seemed to interfere with her and to\r\nprevent her from speaking to Terence. Very soon Helen saw her staring\r\nmoodily at a coil of rope, and making no effort to listen. Mr. Flushing\r\nand St. John were engaged in more or less continuous conversation about\r\nthe future of the country from a political point of view, and the\r\ndegree to which it had been explored; the others, with their legs\r\nstretched out, or chins poised on the hands, gazed in silence.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ambrose looked and listened obediently enough, but inwardly she\r\nwas prey to an uneasy mood not readily to be ascribed to any one cause.\r\nLooking on shore as Mr. Flushing bade her, she thought the country very\r\nbeautiful, but also sultry and alarming. She did not like to feel\r\nherself the victim of unclassified emotions, and certainly as the\r\nlaunch slipped on and on, in the hot morning sun, she felt herself\r\nunreasonably moved. Whether the unfamiliarity of the forest was the\r\ncause of it, or something less definite, she could not determine. Her\r\nmind left the scene and occupied itself with anxieties for Ridley, for\r\nher children, for far-off things, such as old age and poverty and\r\ndeath. Hirst, too, was depressed. He had been looking forward to this\r\nexpedition as to a holiday, for, once away from the hotel, surely\r\nwonderful things would happen, instead of which nothing happened, and\r\nhere they were as uncomfortable, as restrained, as self-conscious as\r\never. That, of course, was what came of looking forward to anything;\r\none was always disappointed. He blamed Wilfrid Flushing, who was so\r\nwell dressed and so formal; he blamed Hewet and Rachel. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t they\r\ntalk? He looked at them sitting silent and self-absorbed, and the sight\r\nannoyed him. He supposed that they were engaged, or about to become\r\nengaged, but instead of being in the least romantic or exciting, that\r\nwas as dull as everything else; it annoyed him, too, to think that they\r\nwere in love. He drew close to Helen and began to tell her how\r\nuncomfortable his night had been, lying on the deck, sometimes too hot,\r\nsometimes too cold, and the stars so bright that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get to\r\nsleep. He had lain awake all night thinking, and when it was light\r\nenough to see, he had written twenty lines of his poem on God, and the\r\nawful thing was that he\xe2\x80\x99d practically proved the fact that God did not\r\nexist. He did not see that he was teasing her, and he went on to wonder\r\nwhat would happen if God did exist\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9can old gentleman in a beard and a\r\nlong blue dressing gown, extremely testy and disagreeable as he\xe2\x80\x99s bound\r\nto be? Can you suggest a rhyme? God, rod, sod\xe2\x80\x94all used; any others?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlthough he spoke much as usual, Helen could have seen, had she looked,\r\nthat he was also impatient and disturbed. But she was not called upon\r\nto answer, for Mr. Flushing now exclaimed \xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d They looked at the\r\nhut on the bank, a desolate place with a large rent in the roof, and\r\nthe ground round it yellow, scarred with fires and scattered with rusty\r\nopen tins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid they find his dead body there?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Flushing exclaimed, leaning\r\nforward in her eagerness to see the spot where the explorer had died.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey found his body and his skins and a notebook,\xe2\x80\x9d her husband\r\nreplied. But the boat had soon carried them on and left the place\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nIt was so hot that they scarcely moved, except now to change a foot,\r\nor, again, to strike a match. Their eyes, concentrated upon the bank,\r\nwere full of the same green reflections, and their lips were slightly\r\npressed together as though the sights they were passing gave rise to\r\nthoughts, save that Hirst\xe2\x80\x99s lips moved intermittently as half\r\nconsciously he sought rhymes for God. Whatever the thoughts of the\r\nothers, no one said anything for a considerable space. They had grown\r\nso accustomed to the wall of trees on either side that they looked up\r\nwith a start when the light suddenly widened out and the trees came to\r\nan end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt almost reminds one of an English park,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Flushing.\r\n\r\nIndeed no change could have been greater. On both banks of the river\r\nlay an open lawn-like space, grass covered and planted, for the\r\ngentleness and order of the place suggested human care, with graceful\r\ntrees on the top of little mounds. As far as they could gaze, this lawn\r\nrose and sank with the undulating motion of an old English park. The\r\nchange of scene naturally suggested a change of position, grateful to\r\nmost of them. They rose and leant over the rail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might be Arundel or Windsor,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Flushing continued, \xe2\x80\x9cif you cut\r\ndown that bush with the yellow flowers; and, by Jove, look!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRows of brown backs paused for a moment and then leapt with a motion as\r\nif they were springing over waves out of sight. For a moment no one of\r\nthem could believe that they had really seen live animals in the open\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nherd of wild deer, and the sight aroused a childlike excitement in\r\nthem, dissipating their gloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never in my life seen anything bigger than a hare!\xe2\x80\x9d Hirst\r\nexclaimed with genuine excitement. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat an ass I was not to bring my\r\nKodak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards the launch came gradually to a standstill, and the\r\ncaptain explained to Mr. Flushing that it would be pleasant for the\r\npassengers if they now went for a stroll on shore; if they chose to\r\nreturn within an hour, he would take them on to the village; if they\r\nchose to walk\xe2\x80\x94it was only a mile or two farther on\xe2\x80\x94he would meet them\r\nat the landing-place.\r\n\r\nThe matter being settled, they were once more put on shore: the\r\nsailors, producing raisins and tobacco, leant upon the rail and watched\r\nthe six English, whose coats and dresses looked so strange upon the\r\ngreen, wander off. A joke that was by no means proper set them all\r\nlaughing, and then they turned round and lay at their ease upon the\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\nDirectly they landed, Terence and Rachel drew together slightly in\r\nadvance of the others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God!\xe2\x80\x9d Terence exclaimed, drawing a long breath. \xe2\x80\x9cAt last we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if we keep ahead we can talk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, although their position some yards in advance of the\r\nothers made it possible for them to say anything they chose, they were\r\nboth silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou love me?\xe2\x80\x9d Terence asked at length, breaking the silence painfully.\r\nTo speak or to be silent was equally an effort, for when they were\r\nsilent they were keenly conscious of each other\xe2\x80\x99s presence, and yet\r\nwords were either too trivial or too large.\r\n\r\nShe murmured inarticulately, ending, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; but there were so many things to be said, and\r\nnow that they were alone it seemed necessary to bring themselves still\r\nmore near, and to surmount a barrier which had grown up since they had\r\nlast spoken. It was difficult, frightening even, oddly embarrassing. At\r\none moment he was clear-sighted, and, at the next, confused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I\xe2\x80\x99m going to begin at the beginning,\xe2\x80\x9d he said resolutely. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing to tell you what I ought to have told you before. In the first\r\nplace, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been in love with other women, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve had other\r\nwomen. Then I\xe2\x80\x99ve great faults. I\xe2\x80\x99m very lazy, I\xe2\x80\x99m moody\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He persisted,\r\nin spite of her exclamation, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to know the worst of me. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nlustful. I\xe2\x80\x99m overcome by a sense of futility\xe2\x80\x94incompetence. I ought\r\nnever to have asked you to marry me, I expect. I\xe2\x80\x99m a bit of a snob; I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nambitious\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, our faults!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do they matter?\xe2\x80\x9d Then she demanded,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I in love\xe2\x80\x94is this being in love\xe2\x80\x94are we to marry each other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOvercome by the charm of her voice and her presence, he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re free, Rachel. To you, time will make no difference, or marriage\r\nor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voices of the others behind them kept floating, now farther, now\r\nnearer, and Mrs. Flushing\xe2\x80\x99s laugh rose clearly by itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarriage?\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel repeated.\r\n\r\nThe shouts were renewed behind, warning them that they were bearing too\r\nfar to the left. Improving their course, he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe feeling that they could not be united until she knew all about him\r\nmade him again endeavour to explain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that\xe2\x80\x99s been bad in me, the things I\xe2\x80\x99ve put up with\xe2\x80\x94the second\r\nbest\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe murmured, considered her own life, but could not describe how it\r\nlooked to her now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the loneliness!\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. A vision of walking with her\r\nthrough the streets of London came before his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will go for\r\nwalks together,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. The simplicity of the idea relieved them, and\r\nfor the first time they laughed. They would have liked had they dared\r\nto take each other by the hand, but the consciousness of eyes fixed on\r\nthem from behind had not yet deserted them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBooks, people, sights\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Nutt, Greeley, Hutchinson,\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet murmured.\r\n\r\nWith every word the mist which had enveloped them, making them seem\r\nunreal to each other, since the previous afternoon melted a little\r\nfurther, and their contact became more and more natural. Up through the\r\nsultry southern landscape they saw the world they knew appear clearer\r\nand more vividly than it had ever appeared before. As upon that\r\noccasion at the hotel when she had sat in the window, the world once\r\nmore arranged itself beneath her gaze very vividly and in its true\r\nproportions. She glanced curiously at Terence from time to time,\r\nobserving his grey coat and his purple tie; observing the man with whom\r\nshe was to spend the rest of her life.\r\n\r\nAfter one of these glances she murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99m in love. There\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\ndoubt; I\xe2\x80\x99m in love with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNevertheless, they remained uncomfortably apart; drawn so close\r\ntogether, as she spoke, that there seemed no division between them, and\r\nthe next moment separate and far away again. Feeling this painfully,\r\nshe exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be a fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut as she looked at him she perceived from the shape of his eyes, the\r\nlines about his mouth, and other peculiarities that he pleased her, and\r\nshe added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere I want to fight, you have compassion. You\xe2\x80\x99re finer than I am;\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re much finer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe returned her glance and smiled, perceiving, much as she had done,\r\nthe very small individual things about her which made her delightful to\r\nhim. She was his for ever. This barrier being surmounted, innumerable\r\ndelights lay before them both.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not finer,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only older, lazier; a man, not a\r\nwoman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, and a curious sense of possession coming over\r\nher, it struck her that she might now touch him; she put out her hand\r\nand lightly touched his cheek. His fingers followed where hers had\r\nbeen, and the touch of his hand upon his face brought back the\r\noverpowering sense of unreality. This body of his was unreal; the whole\r\nworld was unreal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s happened?\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did I ask you to marry me? How did it\r\nhappen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ask me to marry you?\xe2\x80\x9d she wondered. They faded far away from\r\neach other, and neither of them could remember what had been said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe sat upon the ground,\xe2\x80\x9d he recollected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe sat upon the ground,\xe2\x80\x9d she confirmed him. The recollection of\r\nsitting upon the ground, such as it was, seemed to unite them again,\r\nand they walked on in silence, their minds sometimes working with\r\ndifficulty and sometimes ceasing to work, their eyes alone perceiving\r\nthe things round them. Now he would attempt again to tell her his\r\nfaults, and why he loved her; and she would describe what she had felt\r\nat this time or at that time, and together they would interpret her\r\nfeeling. So beautiful was the sound of their voices that by degrees\r\nthey scarcely listened to the words they framed. Long silences came\r\nbetween their words, which were no longer silences of struggle and\r\nconfusion but refreshing silences, in which trivial thoughts moved\r\neasily. They began to speak naturally of ordinary things, of the\r\nflowers and the trees, how they grew there so red, like garden flowers\r\nat home, and there bent and crooked like the arm of a twisted old man.\r\n\r\nVery gently and quietly, almost as if it were the blood singing in her\r\nveins, or the water of the stream running over stones, Rachel became\r\nconscious of a new feeling within her. She wondered for a moment what\r\nit was, and then said to herself, with a little surprise at recognising\r\nin her own person so famous a thing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is happiness, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d And aloud to Terence she spoke, \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\nis happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the heels of her words he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is happiness,\xe2\x80\x9d upon which\r\nthey guessed that the feeling had sprung in both of them the same time.\r\nThey began therefore to describe how this felt and that felt, how like\r\nit was and yet how different; for they were very different.\r\n\r\nVoices crying behind them never reached through the waters in which\r\nthey were now sunk. The repetition of Hewet\xe2\x80\x99s name in short, dissevered\r\nsyllables was to them the crack of a dry branch or the laughter of a\r\nbird. The grasses and breezes sounding and murmuring all round them,\r\nthey never noticed that the swishing of the grasses grew louder and\r\nlouder, and did not cease with the lapse of the breeze. A hand dropped\r\nabrupt as iron on Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder; it might have been a bolt from\r\nheaven. She fell beneath it, and the grass whipped across her eyes and\r\nfilled her mouth and ears. Through the waving stems she saw a figure,\r\nlarge and shapeless against the sky. Helen was upon her. Rolled this\r\nway and that, now seeing only forests of green, and now the high blue\r\nheaven; she was speechless and almost without sense. At last she lay\r\nstill, all the grasses shaken round her and before her by her panting.\r\nOver her loomed two great heads, the heads of a man and woman, of\r\nTerence and Helen.\r\n\r\nBoth were flushed, both laughing, and the lips were moving; they came\r\ntogether and kissed in the air above her. Broken fragments of speech\r\ncame down to her on the ground. She thought she heard them speak of\r\nlove and then of marriage. Raising herself and sitting up, she too\r\nrealised Helen\xe2\x80\x99s soft body, the strong and hospitable arms, and\r\nhappiness swelling and breaking in one vast wave. When this fell away,\r\nand the grasses once more lay low, and the sky became horizontal, and\r\nthe earth rolled out flat on each side, and the trees stood upright,\r\nshe was the first to perceive a little row of human figures standing\r\npatiently in the distance. For the moment she could not remember who\r\nthey were.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are they?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, and then recollected.\r\n\r\nFalling into line behind Mr. Flushing, they were careful to leave at\r\nleast three yards\xe2\x80\x99 distance between the toe of his boot and the rim of\r\nher skirt.\r\n\r\nHe led them across a stretch of green by the river-bank and then\r\nthrough a grove of trees, and bade them remark the signs of human\r\nhabitation, the blackened grass, the charred tree-stumps, and there,\r\nthrough the trees, strange wooden nests, drawn together in an arch\r\nwhere the trees drew apart, the village which was the goal of their\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nStepping cautiously, they observed the women, who were squatting on the\r\nground in triangular shapes, moving their hands, either plaiting straw\r\nor in kneading something in bowls. But when they had looked for a\r\nmoment undiscovered, they were seen, and Mr. Flushing, advancing into\r\nthe centre of the clearing, was engaged in talk with a lean majestic\r\nman, whose bones and hollows at once made the shapes of the\r\nEnglishman\xe2\x80\x99s body appear ugly and unnatural. The women took no notice\r\nof the strangers, except that their hands paused for a moment and their\r\nlong narrow eyes slid round and fixed upon them with the motionless\r\ninexpressive gaze of those removed from each other far far beyond the\r\nplunge of speech. Their hands moved again, but the stare continued. It\r\nfollowed them as they walked, as they peered into the huts where they\r\ncould distinguish guns leaning in the corner, and bowls upon the floor,\r\nand stacks of rushes; in the dusk the solemn eyes of babies regarded\r\nthem, and old women stared out too. As they sauntered about, the stare\r\nfollowed them, passing over their legs, their bodies, their heads,\r\ncuriously not without hostility, like the crawl of a winter fly. As she\r\ndrew apart her shawl and uncovered her breast to the lips of her baby,\r\nthe eyes of a woman never left their faces, although they moved\r\nuneasily under her stare, and finally turned away, rather than stand\r\nthere looking at her any longer. When sweetmeats were offered them,\r\nthey put out great red hands to take them, and felt themselves treading\r\ncumbrously like tight-coated soldiers among these soft instinctive\r\npeople. But soon the life of the village took no notice of them; they\r\nhad become absorbed in it. The women\xe2\x80\x99s hands became busy again with the\r\nstraw; their eyes dropped. If they moved, it was to fetch something\r\nfrom the hut, or to catch a straying child, or to cross the space with\r\na jar balanced on their heads; if they spoke, it was to cry some harsh\r\nunintelligible cry. Voices rose when a child was beaten, and fell\r\nagain; voices rose in song, which slid up a little way and down a\r\nlittle way, and settled again upon the same low and melancholy note.\r\nSeeking each other, Terence and Rachel drew together under a tree.\r\nPeaceful, and even beautiful at first, the sight of the women, who had\r\ngiven up looking at them, made them now feel very cold and melancholy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Terence sighed at length, \xe2\x80\x9cit makes us seem insignificant,\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel agreed. So it would go on for ever and ever, she said, those\r\nwomen sitting under the trees, the trees and the river. They turned\r\naway and began to walk through the trees, leaning, without fear of\r\ndiscovery, upon each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms. They had not gone far before they\r\nbegan to assure each other once more that they were in love, were\r\nhappy, were content; but why was it so painful being in love, why was\r\nthere so much pain in happiness?\r\n\r\nThe sight of the village indeed affected them all curiously though all\r\ndifferently. St. John had left the others and was walking slowly down\r\nto the river, absorbed in his own thoughts, which were bitter and\r\nunhappy, for he felt himself alone; and Helen, standing by herself in\r\nthe sunny space among the native women, was exposed to presentiments of\r\ndisaster. The cries of the senseless beasts rang in her ears high and\r\nlow in the air, as they ran from tree-trunk to tree-top. How small the\r\nlittle figures looked wandering through the trees! She became acutely\r\nconscious of the little limbs, the thin veins, the delicate flesh of\r\nmen and women, which breaks so easily and lets the life escape compared\r\nwith these great trees and deep waters. A falling branch, a foot that\r\nslips, and the earth has crushed them or the water drowned them. Thus\r\nthinking, she kept her eyes anxiously fixed upon the lovers, as if by\r\ndoing so she could protect them from their fate. Turning, she found the\r\nFlushings by her side.\r\n\r\nThey were talking about the things they had bought and arguing whether\r\nthey were really old, and whether there were not signs here and there\r\nof European influence. Helen was appealed to. She was made to look at a\r\nbrooch, and then at a pair of ear-rings. But all the time she blamed\r\nthem for having come on this expedition, for having ventured too far\r\nand exposed themselves. Then she roused herself and tried to talk, but\r\nin a few moments she caught herself seeing a picture of a boat upset on\r\nthe river in England, at midday. It was morbid, she knew, to imagine\r\nsuch things; nevertheless she sought out the figures of the others\r\nbetween the trees, and whenever she saw them she kept her eyes fixed on\r\nthem, so that she might be able to protect them from disaster.\r\n\r\nBut when the sun went down and the steamer turned and began to steam\r\nback towards civilisation, again her fears were calmed. In the\r\nsemi-darkness the chairs on deck and the people sitting in them were\r\nangular shapes, the mouth being indicated by a tiny burning spot, and\r\nthe arm by the same spot moving up or down as the cigar or cigarette\r\nwas lifted to and from the lips. Words crossed the darkness, but, not\r\nknowing where they fell, seemed to lack energy and substance. Deep\r\nsighs proceeded regularly, although with some attempt at suppression,\r\nfrom the large white mound which represented the person of Mrs.\r\nFlushing. The day had been long and very hot, and now that all the\r\ncolours were blotted out the cool night air seemed to press soft\r\nfingers upon the eyelids, sealing them down. Some philosophical remark\r\ndirected, apparently, at St. John Hirst missed its aim, and hung so\r\nlong suspended in the air until it was engulfed by a yawn, that it was\r\nconsidered dead, and this gave the signal for stirring of legs and\r\nmurmurs about sleep. The white mound moved, finally lengthened itself\r\nand disappeared, and after a few turns and paces St. John and Mr.\r\nFlushing withdrew, leaving the three chairs still occupied by three\r\nsilent bodies. The light which came from a lamp high on the mast and a\r\nsky pale with stars left them with shapes but without features; but\r\neven in this darkness the withdrawal of the others made them feel each\r\nother very near, for they were all thinking of the same thing. For some\r\ntime no one spoke, then Helen said with a sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99re both very\r\nhappy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs if washed by the air her voice sounded more spiritual and softer\r\nthan usual. Voices at a little distance answered her, \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThrough the darkness she was looking at them both, and trying to\r\ndistinguish him. What was there for her to say? Rachel had passed\r\nbeyond her guardianship. A voice might reach her ears, but never again\r\nwould it carry as far as it had carried twenty-four hours ago.\r\nNevertheless, speech seemed to be due from her before she went to bed.\r\nShe wished to speak, but she felt strangely old and depressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you realise what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s young, you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nboth young; and marriage\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Here she ceased. They begged her, however,\r\nto continue, with such earnestness in their voices, as if they only\r\ncraved advice, that she was led to add:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarriage! well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what we want to know,\xe2\x80\x9d they answered, and she guessed that now\r\nthey were looking at each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt depends on both of you,\xe2\x80\x9d she stated. Her face was turned towards\r\nTerence, and although he could hardly see her, he believed that her\r\nwords really covered a genuine desire to know more about him. He raised\r\nhimself from his semi-recumbent position and proceeded to tell her what\r\nshe wanted to know. He spoke as lightly as he could in order to take\r\naway her depression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m twenty-seven, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve about seven hundred a year,\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\ntemper is good on the whole, and health excellent, though Hirst detects\r\na gouty tendency. Well, then, I think I\xe2\x80\x99m very intelligent.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused\r\nas if for confirmation.\r\n\r\nHelen agreed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough, unfortunately, rather lazy. I intend to allow Rachel to be a\r\nfool if she wants to, and\xe2\x80\x94Do you find me on the whole satisfactory in\r\nother respects?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked shyly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I like what I know of you,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut then\xe2\x80\x94one knows so\r\nlittle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall live in London,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d With one voice they\r\nsuddenly enquired whether she did not think them the happiest people\r\nthat she had ever known.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush,\xe2\x80\x9d she checked them, \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Flushing, remember. She\xe2\x80\x99s behind us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they fell silent, and Terence and Rachel felt instinctively that\r\ntheir happiness had made her sad, and, while they were anxious to go on\r\ntalking about themselves, they did not like to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve talked too much about ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d Terence said. \xe2\x80\x9cTell us\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, tell us\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel echoed. They were both in the mood to believe\r\nthat every one was capable of saying something very profound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d Helen reflected, speaking more to herself in a\r\nrambling style than as a prophetess delivering a message. She forced\r\nherself to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, though I scold Rachel, I\xe2\x80\x99m not much wiser myself. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nolder, of course, I\xe2\x80\x99m half-way through, and you\xe2\x80\x99re just beginning. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npuzzling\xe2\x80\x94sometimes, I think, disappointing; the great things aren\xe2\x80\x99t as\r\ngreat, perhaps, as one expects\xe2\x80\x94but it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting\xe2\x80\x94Oh, yes, you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ncertain to find it interesting\xe2\x80\x94And so it goes on,\xe2\x80\x9d they became\r\nconscious here of the procession of dark trees into which, as far as\r\nthey could see, Helen was now looking, \xe2\x80\x9cand there are pleasures where\r\none doesn\xe2\x80\x99t expect them (you must write to your father), and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nvery happy, I\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt. But I must go to bed, and if you are\r\nsensible you will follow in ten minutes, and so,\xe2\x80\x9d she rose and stood\r\nbefore them, almost featureless and very large, \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\npassed behind the curtain.\r\n\r\nAfter sitting in silence for the greater part of the ten minutes she\r\nallowed them, they rose and hung over the rail. Beneath them the smooth\r\nblack water slipped away very fast and silently. The spark of a\r\ncigarette vanished behind them. \xe2\x80\x9cA beautiful voice,\xe2\x80\x9d Terence murmured.\r\n\r\nRachel assented. Helen had a beautiful voice.\r\n\r\nAfter a silence she asked, looking up into the sky, \xe2\x80\x9cAre we on the deck\r\nof a steamer on a river in South America? Am I Rachel, are you\r\nTerence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe great black world lay round them. As they were drawn smoothly along\r\nit seemed possessed of immense thickness and endurance. They could\r\ndiscern pointed tree-tops and blunt rounded tree-tops. Raising their\r\neyes above the trees, they fixed them on the stars and the pale border\r\nof sky above the trees. The little points of frosty light infinitely\r\nfar away drew their eyes and held them fixed, so that it seemed as if\r\nthey stayed a long time and fell a great distance when once more they\r\nrealised their hands grasping the rail and their separate bodies\r\nstanding side by side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d forgotten completely about me,\xe2\x80\x9d Terence reproached her, taking\r\nher arm and beginning to pace the deck, \xe2\x80\x9cand I never forget you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, she had not forgotten, only the stars\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x94the dark\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re like a bird half asleep in its nest, Rachel. You\xe2\x80\x99re asleep.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re talking in your sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHalf asleep, and murmuring broken words, they stood in the angle made\r\nby the bow of the boat. It slipped on down the river. Now a bell struck\r\non the bridge, and they heard the lapping of water as it rippled away\r\non either side, and once a bird startled in its sleep creaked, flew on\r\nto the next tree, and was silent again. The darkness poured down\r\nprofusely, and left them with scarcely any feeling of life, except that\r\nthey were standing there together in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe darkness fell, but rose again, and as each day spread widely over\r\nthe earth and parted them from the strange day in the forest when they\r\nhad been forced to tell each other what they wanted, this wish of\r\ntheirs was revealed to other people, and in the process became slightly\r\nstrange to themselves. Apparently it was not anything unusual that had\r\nhappened; it was that they had become engaged to marry each other. The\r\nworld, which consisted for the most part of the hotel and the villa,\r\nexpressed itself glad on the whole that two people should marry, and\r\nallowed them to see that they were not expected to take part in the\r\nwork which has to be done in order that the world shall go on, but\r\nmight absent themselves for a time. They were accordingly left alone\r\nuntil they felt the silence as if, playing in a vast church, the door\r\nhad been shut on them. They were driven to walk alone, and sit alone,\r\nto visit secret places where the flowers had never been picked and the\r\ntrees were solitary. In solitude they could express those beautiful but\r\ntoo vast desires which were so oddly uncomfortable to the ears of other\r\nmen and women\xe2\x80\x94desires for a world, such as their own world which\r\ncontained two people seemed to them to be, where people knew each other\r\nintimately and thus judged each other by what was good, and never\r\nquarrelled, because that was waste of time.\r\n\r\nThey would talk of such questions among books, or out in the sun, or\r\nsitting in the shade of a tree undisturbed. They were no longer\r\nembarrassed, or half-choked with meaning which could not express\r\nitself; they were not afraid of each other, or, like travellers down a\r\ntwisting river, dazzled with sudden beauties when the corner is turned;\r\nthe unexpected happened, but even the ordinary was lovable, and in many\r\nways preferable to the ecstatic and mysterious, for it was refreshingly\r\nsolid, and called out effort, and effort under such circumstances was\r\nnot effort but delight.\r\n\r\nWhile Rachel played the piano, Terence sat near her, engaged, as far as\r\nthe occasional writing of a word in pencil testified, in shaping the\r\nworld as it appeared to him now that he and Rachel were going to be\r\nmarried. It was different certainly. The book called _Silence_ would\r\nnot now be the same book that it would have been. He would then put\r\ndown his pencil and stare in front of him, and wonder in what respects\r\nthe world was different\xe2\x80\x94it had, perhaps, more solidity, more coherence,\r\nmore importance, greater depth. Why, even the earth sometimes seemed to\r\nhim very deep; not carved into hills and cities and fields, but heaped\r\nin great masses. He would look out of the window for ten minutes at a\r\ntime; but no, he did not care for the earth swept of human beings. He\r\nliked human beings\xe2\x80\x94he liked them, he suspected, better than Rachel did.\r\nThere she was, swaying enthusiastically over her music, quite forgetful\r\nof him,\xe2\x80\x94but he liked that quality in her. He liked the impersonality\r\nwhich it produced in her. At last, having written down a series of\r\nlittle sentences, with notes of interrogation attached to them, he\r\nobserved aloud, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Women\xe2\x80\x94under the heading Women I\xe2\x80\x99ve written:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Not really vainer than men. Lack of self-confidence at the base of\r\nmost serious faults. Dislike of own sex traditional, or founded on\r\nfact? Every woman not so much a rake at heart, as an optimist, because\r\nthey don\xe2\x80\x99t think.\xe2\x80\x99 What do you say, Rachel?\xe2\x80\x9d He paused with his pencil\r\nin his hand and a sheet of paper on his knee.\r\n\r\nRachel said nothing. Up and up the steep spiral of a very late\r\nBeethoven sonata she climbed, like a person ascending a ruined\r\nstaircase, energetically at first, then more laboriously advancing her\r\nfeet with effort until she could go no higher and returned with a run\r\nto begin at the very bottom again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s the fashion now to say that women are more practical and\r\nless idealistic than men, also that they have considerable organising\r\nability but no sense of honour\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94query, what is meant by masculine term,\r\nhonour?\xe2\x80\x94what corresponds to it in your sex? Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAttacking her staircase once more, Rachel again neglected this\r\nopportunity of revealing the secrets of her sex. She had, indeed,\r\nadvanced so far in the pursuit of wisdom that she allowed these secrets\r\nto rest undisturbed; it seemed to be reserved for a later generation to\r\ndiscuss them philosophically.\r\n\r\nCrashing down a final chord with her left hand, she exclaimed at last,\r\nswinging round upon him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Terence, it\xe2\x80\x99s no good; here am I, the best musician in South\r\nAmerica, not to speak of Europe and Asia, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t play a note\r\nbecause of you in the room interrupting me every other second.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to realise that that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been aiming at for the\r\nlast half-hour,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve no objection to nice simple\r\ntunes\xe2\x80\x94indeed, I find them very helpful to my literary composition, but\r\nthat kind of thing is merely like an unfortunate old dog going round on\r\nits hind legs in the rain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began turning over the little sheets of note-paper which were\r\nscattered on the table, conveying the congratulations of their friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x94all possible wishes for all possible happiness,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he read; \xe2\x80\x9ccorrect,\r\nbut not very vivid, are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re sheer nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThink of words compared\r\nwith sounds!\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cThink of novels and plays and histories\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nPerched on the edge of the table, she stirred the red and yellow\r\nvolumes contemptuously. She seemed to herself to be in a position where\r\nshe could despise all human learning. Terence looked at them too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod, Rachel, you do read trash!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re behind the\r\ntimes too, my dear. No one dreams of reading this kind of thing\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94antiquated problem plays, harrowing descriptions of life in the\r\neast end\xe2\x80\x94oh, no, we\xe2\x80\x99ve exploded all that. Read poetry, Rachel, poetry,\r\npoetry, poetry!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPicking up one of the books, he began to read aloud, his intention\r\nbeing to satirise the short sharp bark of the writer\xe2\x80\x99s English; but she\r\npaid no attention, and after an interval of meditation exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes it ever seem to you, Terence, that the world is composed entirely\r\nof vast blocks of matter, and that we\xe2\x80\x99re nothing but patches of light\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe looked at the soft spots of sun wavering over the carpet and up the\r\nwall\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9clike that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Terence, \xe2\x80\x9cI feel solid; immensely solid; the legs of my\r\nchair might be rooted in the bowels of the earth. But at Cambridge, I\r\ncan remember, there were times when one fell into ridiculous states of\r\nsemi-coma about five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. Hirst does now, I\r\nexpect\xe2\x80\x94oh, no, Hirst wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel continued, \xe2\x80\x9cThe day your note came, asking us to go on the\r\npicnic, I was sitting where you\xe2\x80\x99re sitting now, thinking that; I wonder\r\nif I could think that again? I wonder if the world\xe2\x80\x99s changed? and if\r\nso, when it\xe2\x80\x99ll stop changing, and which is the real world?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I first saw you,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you were like a creature\r\nwho\xe2\x80\x99d lived all its life among pearls and old bones. Your hands were\r\nwet, d\xe2\x80\x99you remember, and you never said a word until I gave you a bit\r\nof bread, and then you said, \xe2\x80\x98Human Beings!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I thought you\xe2\x80\x94a prig,\xe2\x80\x9d she recollected. \xe2\x80\x9cNo; that\xe2\x80\x99s not quite it.\r\nThere were the ants who stole the tongue, and I thought you and St.\r\nJohn were like those ants\xe2\x80\x94very big, very ugly, very energetic, with all\r\nyour virtues on your backs. However, when I talked to you I liked you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou fell in love with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he corrected her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were in love with me\r\nall the time, only you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I never fell in love with you,\xe2\x80\x9d she asserted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRachel\xe2\x80\x94what a lie\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t you sit here looking at my window\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nwander about the hotel like an owl in the sun\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cI never fell in love, if falling in love is what\r\npeople say it is, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the world that tells the lies and I tell the\r\ntruth. Oh, what lies\xe2\x80\x94what lies!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe crumpled together a handful of letters from Evelyn M., from Mr.\r\nPepper, from Mrs. Thornbury and Miss Allan, and Susan Warrington. It\r\nwas strange, considering how very different these people were, that\r\nthey used almost the same sentences when they wrote to congratulate her\r\nupon her engagement.\r\n\r\nThat any one of these people had ever felt what she felt, or could ever\r\nfeel it, or had even the right to pretend for a single second that they\r\nwere capable of feeling it, appalled her much as the church service had\r\ndone, much as the face of the hospital nurse had done; and if they\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t feel a thing why did they go and pretend to? The simplicity and\r\narrogance and hardness of her youth, now concentrated into a single\r\nspark as it was by her love of him, puzzled Terence; being engaged had\r\nnot that effect on him; the world was different, but not in that way;\r\nhe still wanted the things he had always wanted, and in particular he\r\nwanted the companionship of other people more than ever perhaps. He\r\ntook the letters out of her hand, and protested:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course they\xe2\x80\x99re absurd, Rachel; of course they say things just\r\nbecause other people say them, but even so, what a nice woman Miss\r\nAllan is; you can\xe2\x80\x99t deny that; and Mrs. Thornbury too; she\xe2\x80\x99s got too\r\nmany children I grant you, but if half-a-dozen of them had gone to the\r\nbad instead of rising infallibly to the tops of their trees\xe2\x80\x94hasn\xe2\x80\x99t she\r\na kind of beauty\xe2\x80\x94of elemental simplicity as Flushing would say? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshe rather like a large old tree murmuring in the moonlight, or a river\r\ngoing on and on and on? By the way, Ralph\xe2\x80\x99s been made governor of the\r\nCarroway Islands\xe2\x80\x94the youngest governor in the service; very good, isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Rachel was at present unable to conceive that the vast majority of\r\nthe affairs of the world went on unconnected by a single thread with\r\nher own destiny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t have eleven children,\xe2\x80\x9d she asserted; \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t have the eyes of\r\nan old woman. She looks at one up and down, up and down, as if one were\r\na horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must have a son and we must have a daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Terence, putting\r\ndown the letters, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause, let alone the inestimable advantage of\r\nbeing our children, they\xe2\x80\x99d be so well brought up.\xe2\x80\x9d They went on to\r\nsketch an outline of the ideal education\xe2\x80\x94how their daughter should be\r\nrequired from infancy to gaze at a large square of cardboard painted\r\nblue, to suggest thoughts of infinity, for women were grown too\r\npractical; and their son\xe2\x80\x94he should be taught to laugh at great men,\r\nthat is, at distinguished successful men, at men who wore ribands and\r\nrose to the tops of their trees. He should in no way resemble (Rachel\r\nadded) St. John Hirst.\r\n\r\nAt this Terence professed the greatest admiration for St. John Hirst.\r\nDwelling upon his good qualities he became seriously convinced of them;\r\nhe had a mind like a torpedo, he declared, aimed at falsehood. Where\r\nshould we all be without him and his like? Choked in weeds; Christians,\r\nbigots,\xe2\x80\x94why, Rachel herself, would be a slave with a fan to sing songs\r\nto men when they felt drowsy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ll never see it!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed; \xe2\x80\x9cbecause with all your virtues\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t, and you never will, care with every fibre of your being for\r\nthe pursuit of truth! You\xe2\x80\x99ve no respect for facts, Rachel; you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nessentially feminine.\xe2\x80\x9d She did not trouble to deny it, nor did she\r\nthink good to produce the one unanswerable argument against the merits\r\nwhich Terence admired. St. John Hirst said that she was in love with\r\nhim; she would never forgive that; but the argument was not one to\r\nappeal to a man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I like him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and she thought to herself that she also\r\npitied him, as one pities those unfortunate people who are outside the\r\nwarm mysterious globe full of changes and miracles in which we\r\nourselves move about; she thought that it must be very dull to be St.\r\nJohn Hirst.\r\n\r\nShe summed up what she felt about him by saying that she would not kiss\r\nhim supposing he wished it, which was not likely.\r\n\r\nAs if some apology were due to Hirst for the kiss which she then\r\nbestowed upon him, Terence protested:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd compared with Hirst I\xe2\x80\x99m a perfect Zany.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe clock here struck twelve instead of eleven.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re wasting the morning\xe2\x80\x94I ought to be writing my book, and you ought\r\nto be answering these.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve only got twenty-one whole mornings left,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99ll be here in a day or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever, she drew a pen and paper towards her and began to write\r\nlaboriously,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Evelyn\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTerence, meanwhile, read a novel which some one else had written, a\r\nprocess which he found essential to the composition of his own. For a\r\nconsiderable time nothing was to be heard but the ticking of the clock\r\nand the fitful scratch of Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s pen, as she produced phrases which\r\nbore a considerable likeness to those which she had condemned. She was\r\nstruck by it herself, for she stopped writing and looked up; looked at\r\nTerence deep in the arm-chair, looked at the different pieces of\r\nfurniture, at her bed in the corner, at the window-pane which showed\r\nthe branches of a tree filled in with sky, heard the clock ticking, and\r\nwas amazed at the gulf which lay between all that and her sheet of\r\npaper. Would there ever be a time when the world was one and\r\nindivisible? Even with Terence himself\xe2\x80\x94how far apart they could be, how\r\nlittle she knew what was passing in his brain now! She then finished\r\nher sentence, which was awkward and ugly, and stated that they were\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cboth very happy, and going to be married in the autumn probably and\r\nhope to live in London, where we hope you will come and see us when we\r\nget back.\xe2\x80\x9d Choosing \xe2\x80\x9caffectionately,\xe2\x80\x9d after some further speculation,\r\nrather than sincerely, she signed the letter and was doggedly beginning\r\non another when Terence remarked, quoting from his book:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to this, Rachel. \xe2\x80\x98It is probable that Hugh\xe2\x80\x99 (he\xe2\x80\x99s the hero, a\r\nliterary man), \xe2\x80\x98had not realised at the time of his marriage, any more\r\nthan the young man of parts and imagination usually does realise, the\r\nnature of the gulf which separates the needs and desires of the male\r\nfrom the needs and desires of the female. . . . At first they had been\r\nvery happy. The walking tour in Switzerland had been a time of jolly\r\ncompanionship and stimulating revelations for both of them. Betty had\r\nproved herself the ideal comrade. . . . They had shouted _Love in the\r\nValley_ to each other across the snowy slopes of the Riffelhorn\xe2\x80\x99 (and\r\nso on, and so on\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll skip the descriptions). . . . \xe2\x80\x98But in London,\r\nafter the boy\xe2\x80\x99s birth, all was changed. Betty was an admirable mother;\r\nbut it did not take her long to find out that motherhood, as that\r\nfunction is understood by the mother of the upper middle classes, did\r\nnot absorb the whole of her energies. She was young and strong, with\r\nhealthy limbs and a body and brain that called urgently for exercise. .\r\n. .\xe2\x80\x99 (In short she began to give tea-parties.) . . . \xe2\x80\x98Coming in late\r\nfrom this singular talk with old Bob Murphy in his smoky, book-lined\r\nroom, where the two men had each unloosened his soul to the other, with\r\nthe sound of the traffic humming in his ears, and the foggy London sky\r\nslung tragically across his mind . . . he found women\xe2\x80\x99s hats dotted\r\nabout among his papers. Women\xe2\x80\x99s wraps and absurd little feminine shoes\r\nand umbrellas were in the hall. . . . Then the bills began to come in.\r\n. . . He tried to speak frankly to her. He found her lying on the great\r\npolar-bear skin in their bedroom, half-undressed, for they were dining\r\nwith the Greens in Wilton Crescent, the ruddy firelight making the\r\ndiamonds wink and twinkle on her bare arms and in the delicious curve\r\nof her breast\xe2\x80\x94a vision of adorable femininity. He forgave her all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n(Well, this goes from bad to worse, and finally about fifty pages\r\nlater, Hugh takes a week-end ticket to Swanage and \xe2\x80\x98has it out with\r\nhimself on the downs above Corfe.\xe2\x80\x99 . . . Here there\xe2\x80\x99s fifteen pages or\r\nso which we\xe2\x80\x99ll skip. The conclusion is . . .) \xe2\x80\x98They were different.\r\nPerhaps, in the far future, when generations of men had struggled and\r\nfailed as he must now struggle and fail, woman would be, indeed, what\r\nshe now made a pretence of being\xe2\x80\x94the friend and companion\xe2\x80\x94not the enemy\r\nand parasite of man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe end of it is, you see, Hugh went back to his wife, poor fellow. It\r\nwas his duty, as a married man. Lord, Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cwill it\r\nbe like that when we\xe2\x80\x99re married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of answering him she asked,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t people write about the things they do feel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that\xe2\x80\x99s the difficulty!\xe2\x80\x9d he sighed, tossing the book away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, what will it be like when we\xe2\x80\x99re married? What are the\r\nthings people do feel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seemed doubtful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit on the floor and let me look at you,\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded. Resting her\r\nchin on his knee, she looked straight at him.\r\n\r\nHe examined her curiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I like your face. I like the way\r\nyour hair grows down in a point, and your eyes too\xe2\x80\x94they never see\r\nanything. Your mouth\xe2\x80\x99s too big, and your cheeks would be better if they\r\nhad more colour in them. But what I like about your face is that it\r\nmakes one wonder what the devil you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about\xe2\x80\x94it makes me want\r\nto do that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He clenched his fist and shook it so near her that she\r\nstarted back, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause now you look as if you\xe2\x80\x99d blow my brains out.\r\nThere are moments,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen, if we stood on a rock\r\ntogether, you\xe2\x80\x99d throw me into the sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHypnotised by the force of his eyes in hers, she repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cIf we stood\r\non a rock together\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo be flung into the sea, to be washed hither and thither, and driven\r\nabout the roots of the world\xe2\x80\x94the idea was incoherently delightful. She\r\nsprang up, and began moving about the room, bending and thrusting aside\r\nthe chairs and tables as if she were indeed striking through the\r\nwaters. He watched her with pleasure; she seemed to be cleaving a\r\npassage for herself, and dealing triumphantly with the obstacles which\r\nwould hinder their passage through life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does seem possible!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I\xe2\x80\x99ve always thought it\r\nthe most unlikely thing in the world\xe2\x80\x94I shall be in love with you all my\r\nlife, and our marriage will be the most exciting thing that\xe2\x80\x99s ever been\r\ndone! We\xe2\x80\x99ll never have a moment\xe2\x80\x99s peace\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He caught her in his arms as\r\nshe passed him, and they fought for mastery, imagining a rock, and the\r\nsea heaving beneath them. At last she was thrown to the floor, where\r\nshe lay gasping, and crying for mercy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a mermaid! I can swim,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cso the game\xe2\x80\x99s up.\xe2\x80\x9d Her dress\r\nwas torn across, and peace being established, she fetched a needle and\r\nthread and began to mend the tear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbe quiet and tell me about the world; tell me\r\nabout everything that\xe2\x80\x99s ever happened, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you\xe2\x80\x94let me see,\r\nwhat can I tell you?\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you about Miss Montgomerie and the river\r\nparty. She was left, you see, with one foot in the boat, and the other\r\non shore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had spent much time already in thus filling out for the other the\r\ncourse of their past lives, and the characters of their friends and\r\nrelations, so that very soon Terence knew not only what Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s aunts\r\nmight be expected to say upon every occasion, but also how their\r\nbedrooms were furnished, and what kind of bonnets they wore. He could\r\nsustain a conversation between Mrs. Hunt and Rachel, and carry on a\r\ntea-party including the Rev. William Johnson and Miss Macquoid, the\r\nChristian Scientists, with remarkable likeness to the truth. But he had\r\nknown many more people, and was far more highly skilled in the art of\r\nnarrative than Rachel was, whose experiences were, for the most part,\r\nof a curiously childlike and humorous kind, so that it generally fell\r\nto her lot to listen and ask questions.\r\n\r\nHe told her not only what had happened, but what he had thought and\r\nfelt, and sketched for her portraits which fascinated her of what other\r\nmen and women might be supposed to be thinking and feeling, so that she\r\nbecame very anxious to go back to England, which was full of people,\r\nwhere she could merely stand in the streets and look at them. According\r\nto him, too, there was an order, a pattern which made life reasonable,\r\nor if that word was foolish, made it of deep interest anyhow, for\r\nsometimes it seemed possible to understand why things happened as they\r\ndid. Nor were people so solitary and uncommunicative as she believed.\r\nShe should look for vanity\xe2\x80\x94for vanity was a common quality\xe2\x80\x94first in\r\nherself, and then in Helen, in Ridley, in St. John, they all had their\r\nshare of it\xe2\x80\x94and she would find it in ten people out of every twelve she\r\nmet; and once linked together by one such tie she would find them not\r\nseparate and formidable, but practically indistinguishable, and she\r\nwould come to love them when she found that they were like herself.\r\n\r\nIf she denied this, she must defend her belief that human beings were\r\nas various as the beasts at the Zoo, which had stripes and manes, and\r\nhorns and humps; and so, wrestling over the entire list of their\r\nacquaintances, and diverging into anecdote and theory and speculation,\r\nthey came to know each other. The hours passed quickly, and seemed to\r\nthem full to leaking-point. After a night\xe2\x80\x99s solitude they were always\r\nready to begin again.\r\n\r\nThe virtues which Mrs. Ambrose had once believed to exist in free talk\r\nbetween men and women did in truth exist for both of them, although not\r\nquite in the measure she prescribed. Far more than upon the nature of\r\nsex they dwelt upon the nature of poetry, but it was true that talk\r\nwhich had no boundaries deepened and enlarged the strangely small\r\nbright view of a girl. In return for what he could tell her she brought\r\nhim such curiosity and sensitiveness of perception, that he was led to\r\ndoubt whether any gift bestowed by much reading and living was quite\r\nthe equal of that for pleasure and pain. What would experience give her\r\nafter all, except a kind of ridiculous formal balance, like that of a\r\ndrilled dog in the street? He looked at her face and wondered how it\r\nwould look in twenty years\xe2\x80\x99 time, when the eyes had dulled, and the\r\nforehead wore those little persistent wrinkles which seem to show that\r\nthe middle-aged are facing something hard which the young do not see?\r\nWhat would the hard thing be for them, he wondered? Then his thoughts\r\nturned to their life in England.\r\n\r\nThe thought of England was delightful, for together they would see the\r\nold things freshly; it would be England in June, and there would be\r\nJune nights in the country; and the nightingales singing in the lanes,\r\ninto which they could steal when the room grew hot; and there would be\r\nEnglish meadows gleaming with water and set with stolid cows, and\r\nclouds dipping low and trailing across the green hills. As he sat in\r\nthe room with her, he wished very often to be back again in the thick\r\nof life, doing things with Rachel.\r\n\r\nHe crossed to the window and exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cLord, how good it is to think\r\nof lanes, muddy lanes, with brambles and nettles, you know, and real\r\ngrass fields, and farmyards with pigs and cows, and men walking beside\r\ncarts with pitchforks\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to compare with that here\xe2\x80\x94look at\r\nthe stony red earth, and the bright blue sea, and the glaring white\r\nhouses\xe2\x80\x94how tired one gets of it! And the air, without a stain or a\r\nwrinkle. I\xe2\x80\x99d give anything for a sea mist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel, too, had been thinking of the English country: the flat land\r\nrolling away to the sea, and the woods and the long straight roads,\r\nwhere one can walk for miles without seeing any one, and the great\r\nchurch towers and the curious houses clustered in the valleys, and the\r\nbirds, and the dusk, and the rain falling against the windows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut London, London\xe2\x80\x99s the place,\xe2\x80\x9d Terence continued. They looked\r\ntogether at the carpet, as though London itself were to be seen there\r\nlying on the floor, with all its spires and pinnacles pricking through\r\nthe smoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the whole, what I should like best at this moment,\xe2\x80\x9d Terence\r\npondered, \xe2\x80\x9cwould be to find myself walking down Kingsway, by those big\r\nplacards, you know, and turning into the Strand. Perhaps I might go and\r\nlook over Waterloo Bridge for a moment. Then I\xe2\x80\x99d go along the Strand\r\npast the shops with all the new books in them, and through the little\r\narchway into the Temple. I always like the quiet after the uproar. You\r\nhear your own footsteps suddenly quite loud. The Temple\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\npleasant. I think I should go and see if I could find dear old\r\nHodgkin\xe2\x80\x94the man who writes books about Van Eyck, you know. When I left\r\nEngland he was very sad about his tame magpie. He suspected that a man\r\nhad poisoned it. And then Russell lives on the next staircase. I think\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d like him. He\xe2\x80\x99s a passion for Handel. Well, Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded,\r\ndismissing the vision of London, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall be doing that together in\r\nsix weeks\xe2\x80\x99 time, and it\xe2\x80\x99ll be the middle of June then\xe2\x80\x94and June in\r\nLondon\xe2\x80\x94my God! how pleasant it all is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we\xe2\x80\x99re certain to have it too,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t as if we were\r\nexpecting a great deal\xe2\x80\x94only to walk about and look at things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a thousand a year and perfect freedom,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cHow many\r\npeople in London d\xe2\x80\x99you think have that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you\xe2\x80\x99ve spoilt it,\xe2\x80\x9d she complained. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to think of\r\nthe horrors.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked grudgingly at the novel which had once caused\r\nher perhaps an hour\xe2\x80\x99s discomfort, so that she had never opened it\r\nagain, but kept it on her table, and looked at it occasionally, as some\r\nmedieval monk kept a skull, or a crucifix to remind him of the frailty\r\nof the body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it true, Terence,\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded, \xe2\x80\x9cthat women die with bugs crawling\r\nacross their faces?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s very probable,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you must admit, Rachel,\r\nthat we so seldom think of anything but ourselves that an occasional\r\ntwinge is really rather pleasant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccusing him of an affection of cynicism which was just as bad as\r\nsentimentality itself, she left her position by his side and knelt upon\r\nthe window sill, twisting the curtain tassels between her fingers. A\r\nvague sense of dissatisfaction filled her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s so detestable in this country,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cis the\r\nblue\xe2\x80\x94always blue sky and blue sea. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a curtain\xe2\x80\x94all the things\r\none wants are on the other side of that. I want to know what\xe2\x80\x99s going on\r\nbehind it. I hate these divisions, don\xe2\x80\x99t you, Terence? One person all\r\nin the dark about another person. Now I liked the Dalloways,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cand they\xe2\x80\x99re gone. I shall never see them again. Just by\r\ngoing on a ship we cut ourselves off entirely from the rest of the\r\nworld. I want to see England there\xe2\x80\x94London there\xe2\x80\x94all sorts of people\xe2\x80\x94why\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t one? why should one be shut up all by oneself in a room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile she spoke thus half to herself and with increasing vagueness,\r\nbecause her eye was caught by a ship that had just come into the bay,\r\nshe did not see that Terence had ceased to stare contentedly in front\r\nof him, and was looking at her keenly and with dissatisfaction. She\r\nseemed to be able to cut herself adrift from him, and to pass away to\r\nunknown places where she had no need of him. The thought roused his\r\njealousy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sometimes think you\xe2\x80\x99re not in love with me and never will be,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid energetically. She started and turned round at his words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t satisfy you in the way you satisfy me,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsomething I can\xe2\x80\x99t get hold of in you. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want me as I want\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re always wanting something else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began pacing up and down the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I ask too much,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it isn\xe2\x80\x99t really possible\r\nto have what I want. Men and women are too different. You can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe came up to where she stood looking at him in silence.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her now that what he was saying was perfectly true, and\r\nthat she wanted many more things than the love of one human being\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nsea, the sky. She turned again and looked at the distant blue, which\r\nwas so smooth and serene where the sky met the sea; she could not\r\npossibly want only one human being.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr is it only this damnable engagement?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s be\r\nmarried here, before we go back\xe2\x80\x94or is it too great a risk? Are we sure\r\nwe want to marry each other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey began pacing up and down the room, but although they came very\r\nnear each other in their pacing, they took care not to touch each\r\nother. The hopelessness of their position overcame them both. They were\r\nimpotent; they could never love each other sufficiently to overcome all\r\nthese barriers, and they could never be satisfied with less. Realising\r\nthis with intolerable keenness she stopped in front of him and\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s break it off, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words did more to unite them than any amount of argument. As if\r\nthey stood on the edge of a precipice they clung together. They knew\r\nthat they could not separate; painful and terrible it might be, but\r\nthey were joined for ever. They lapsed into silence, and after a time\r\ncrept together in silence. Merely to be so close soothed them, and\r\nsitting side by side the divisions disappeared, and it seemed as if the\r\nworld were once more solid and entire, and as if, in some strange way,\r\nthey had grown larger and stronger.\r\n\r\nIt was long before they moved, and when they moved it was with great\r\nreluctance. They stood together in front of the looking-glass, and with\r\na brush tried to make themselves look as if they had been feeling\r\nnothing all the morning, neither pain nor happiness. But it chilled\r\nthem to see themselves in the glass, for instead of being vast and\r\nindivisible they were really very small and separate, the size of the\r\nglass leaving a large space for the reflection of other things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nBut no brush was able to efface completely the expression of happiness,\r\nso that Mrs. Ambrose could not treat them when they came downstairs as\r\nif they had spent the morning in a way that could be discussed\r\nnaturally. This being so, she joined in the world\xe2\x80\x99s conspiracy to\r\nconsider them for the time incapacitated from the business of life,\r\nstruck by their intensity of feeling into enmity against life, and\r\nalmost succeeded in dismissing them from her thoughts.\r\n\r\nShe reflected that she had done all that it was necessary to do in\r\npractical matters. She had written a great many letters, and had\r\nobtained Willoughby\xe2\x80\x99s consent. She had dwelt so often upon Mr. Hewet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprospects, his profession, his birth, appearance, and temperament, that\r\nshe had almost forgotten what he was really like. When she refreshed\r\nherself by a look at him, she used to wonder again what he was like,\r\nand then, concluding that they were happy at any rate, thought no more\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nShe might more profitably consider what would happen in three years\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntime, or what might have happened if Rachel had been left to explore\r\nthe world under her father\xe2\x80\x99s guidance. The result, she was honest\r\nenough to own, might have been better\xe2\x80\x94who knows? She did not disguise\r\nfrom herself that Terence had faults. She was inclined to think him too\r\neasy and tolerant, just as he was inclined to think her perhaps a\r\ntrifle hard\xe2\x80\x94no, it was rather that she was uncompromising. In some ways\r\nshe found St. John preferable; but then, of course, he would never have\r\nsuited Rachel. Her friendship with St. John was established, for\r\nalthough she fluctuated between irritation and interest in a way that\r\ndid credit to the candour of her disposition, she liked his company on\r\nthe whole. He took her outside this little world of love and emotion.\r\nHe had a grasp of facts. Supposing, for instance, that England made a\r\nsudden move towards some unknown port on the coast of Morocco, St. John\r\nknew what was at the back of it, and to hear him engaged with her\r\nhusband in argument about finance and the balance of power, gave her an\r\nodd sense of stability. She respected their arguments without always\r\nlistening to them, much as she respected a solid brick wall, or one of\r\nthose immense municipal buildings which, although they compose the\r\ngreater part of our cities, have been built day after day and year\r\nafter year by unknown hands. She liked to sit and listen, and even felt\r\na little elated when the engaged couple, after showing their profound\r\nlack of interest, slipped from the room, and were seen pulling flowers\r\nto pieces in the garden. It was not that she was jealous of them, but\r\nshe did undoubtedly envy them their great unknown future that lay\r\nbefore them. Slipping from one such thought to another, she was at the\r\ndining-room with fruit in her hands. Sometimes she stopped to\r\nstraighten a candle stooping with the heat, or disturbed some too rigid\r\narrangement of the chairs. She had reason to suspect that Chailey had\r\nbeen balancing herself on the top of a ladder with a wet duster during\r\ntheir absence, and the room had never been quite like itself since.\r\nReturning from the dining-room for the third time, she perceived that\r\none of the arm-chairs was now occupied by St. John. He lay back in it,\r\nwith his eyes half shut, looking, as he always did, curiously buttoned\r\nup in a neat grey suit and fenced against the exuberance of a foreign\r\nclimate which might at any moment proceed to take liberties with him.\r\nHer eyes rested on him gently and then passed on over his head. Finally\r\nshe took the chair opposite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to come here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I was positively\r\ndriven to it. . . . Evelyn M.,\xe2\x80\x9d he groaned.\r\n\r\nHe sat up, and began to explain with mock solemnity how the detestable\r\nwoman was set upon marrying him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe pursues me about the place. This morning she appeared in the\r\nsmoking-room. All I could do was to seize my hat and fly. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nto come, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay and face another meal with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we must make the best of it,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen replied philosophically. It\r\nwas very hot, and they were indifferent to any amount of silence, so\r\nthat they lay back in their chairs waiting for something to happen. The\r\nbell rang for luncheon, but there was no sound of movement in the\r\nhouse. Was there any news? Helen asked; anything in the papers? St.\r\nJohn shook his head. O yes, he had a letter from home, a letter from\r\nhis mother, describing the suicide of the parlour-maid. She was called\r\nSusan Jane, and she came into the kitchen one afternoon, and said that\r\nshe wanted cook to keep her money for her; she had twenty pounds in\r\ngold. Then she went out to buy herself a hat. She came in at half-past\r\nfive and said that she had taken poison. They had only just time to get\r\nher into bed and call a doctor before she died.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d Helen enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be an inquest,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. John.\r\n\r\nWhy had she done it? He shrugged his shoulders. Why do people kill\r\nthemselves? Why do the lower orders do any of the things they do do?\r\nNobody knows. They sat in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bell\xe2\x80\x99s run fifteen minutes and they\xe2\x80\x99re not down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen at\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nWhen they appeared, St. John explained why it had been necessary for\r\nhim to come to luncheon. He imitated Evelyn\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiastic tone as she\r\nconfronted him in the smoking-room. \xe2\x80\x9cShe thinks there can be nothing\r\n_quite_ so thrilling as mathematics, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve lent her a large work in\r\ntwo volumes. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be interesting to see what she makes of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel could now afford to laugh at him. She reminded him of Gibbon;\r\nshe had the first volume somewhere still; if he were undertaking the\r\neducation of Evelyn, that surely was the test; or she had heard that\r\nBurke, upon the American Rebellion\xe2\x80\x94Evelyn ought to read them both\r\nsimultaneously. When St. John had disposed of her argument and had\r\nsatisfied his hunger, he proceeded to tell them that the hotel was\r\nseething with scandals, some of the most appalling kind, which had\r\nhappened in their absence; he was indeed much given to the study of his\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvelyn M., for example\xe2\x80\x94but that was told me in confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d Terence interposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve heard about poor Sinclair, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard about Sinclair. He\xe2\x80\x99s retired to his mine with a\r\nrevolver. He writes to Evelyn daily that he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking of committing\r\nsuicide. I\xe2\x80\x99ve assured her that he\xe2\x80\x99s never been so happy in his life,\r\nand, on the whole, she\xe2\x80\x99s inclined to agree with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut then she\xe2\x80\x99s entangled herself with Perrott,\xe2\x80\x9d St. John continued;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I have reason to think, from something I saw in the passage, that\r\neverything isn\xe2\x80\x99t as it should be between Arthur and Susan. There\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nyoung female lately arrived from Manchester. A very good thing if it\r\nwere broken off, in my opinion. Their married life is something too\r\nhorrible to contemplate. Oh, and I distinctly heard old Mrs. Paley\r\nrapping out the most fearful oaths as I passed her bedroom door. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsupposed that she tortures her maid in private\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s practically certain\r\nshe does. One can tell it from the look in her eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re eighty and the gout tweezes you, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be swearing like a\r\ntrooper,\xe2\x80\x9d Terence remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be very fat, very testy, very\r\ndisagreeable. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you imagine him\xe2\x80\x94bald as a coot, with a pair of\r\nsponge-bag trousers, a little spotted tie, and a corporation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a pause Hirst remarked that the worst infamy had still to be\r\ntold. He addressed himself to Helen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve hoofed out the prostitute. One night while we were away that\r\nold numskull Thornbury was doddering about the passages very late.\r\n(Nobody seems to have asked him what _he_ was up to.) He saw the\r\nSignora Lola Mendoza, as she calls herself, cross the passage in her\r\nnightgown. He communicated his suspicions next morning to Elliot, with\r\nthe result that Rodriguez went to the woman and gave her twenty-four\r\nhours in which to clear out of the place. No one seems to have enquired\r\ninto the truth of the story, or to have asked Thornbury and Elliot what\r\nbusiness it was of theirs; they had it entirely their own way. I\r\npropose that we should all sign a Round Robin, go to Rodriguez in a\r\nbody, and insist upon a full enquiry. Something\xe2\x80\x99s got to be done, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou agree?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHewet remarked that there could be no doubt as to the lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a great shame, poor woman; only I don\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s to be done\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite agree with you, St. John,\xe2\x80\x9d Helen burst out. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s monstrous.\r\nThe hypocritical smugness of the English makes my blood boil. A man\r\nwho\xe2\x80\x99s made a fortune in trade as Mr. Thornbury has is bound to be twice\r\nas bad as any prostitute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe respected St. John\xe2\x80\x99s morality, which she took far more seriously\r\nthan any one else did, and now entered into a discussion with him as to\r\nthe steps that were to be taken to enforce their peculiar view of what\r\nwas right. The argument led to some profoundly gloomy statements of a\r\ngeneral nature. Who were they, after all\xe2\x80\x94what authority had they\xe2\x80\x94what\r\npower against the mass of superstition and ignorance? It was the\r\nEnglish, of course; there must be something wrong in the English blood.\r\nDirectly you met an English person, of the middle classes, you were\r\nconscious of an indefinable sensation of loathing; directly you saw the\r\nbrown crescent of houses above Dover, the same thing came over you. But\r\nunfortunately St. John added, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t trust these foreigners\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThey were interrupted by sounds of strife at the further end of the\r\ntable. Rachel appealed to her aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTerence says we must go to tea with Mrs. Thornbury because she\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nso kind, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t see it; in fact, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have my right hand\r\nsawn in pieces\xe2\x80\x94just imagine! the eyes of all those women!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFiddlesticks, Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d Terence replied. \xe2\x80\x9cWho wants to look at you?\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re consumed with vanity! You\xe2\x80\x99re a monster of conceit! Surely,\r\nHelen, you ought to have taught her by this time that she\xe2\x80\x99s a person of\r\nno conceivable importance whatever\xe2\x80\x94not beautiful, or well dressed, or\r\nconspicuous for elegance or intellect, or deportment. A more ordinary\r\nsight than you are,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept for the tear across your\r\ndress has never been seen. However, stay at home if you want to. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe appealed again to her aunt. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the being looked at, she\r\nexplained, but the things people were sure to say. The women in\r\nparticular. She liked women, but where emotion was concerned they were\r\nas flies on a lump of sugar. They would be certain to ask her\r\nquestions. Evelyn M. would say: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you in love? Is it nice being in\r\nlove?\xe2\x80\x9d And Mrs. Thornbury\xe2\x80\x94her eyes would go up and down, up and\r\ndown\xe2\x80\x94she shuddered at the thought of it. Indeed, the retirement of\r\ntheir life since their engagement had made her so sensitive, that she\r\nwas not exaggerating her case.\r\n\r\nShe found an ally in Helen, who proceeded to expound her views of the\r\nhuman race, as she regarded with complacency the pyramid of variegated\r\nfruits in the centre of the table. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that they were cruel, or\r\nmeant to hurt, or even stupid exactly; but she had always found that\r\nthe ordinary person had so little emotion in his own life that the\r\nscent of it in the lives of others was like the scent of blood in the\r\nnostrils of a bloodhound. Warming to the theme, she continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirectly anything happens\xe2\x80\x94it may be a marriage, or a birth, or a\r\ndeath\xe2\x80\x94on the whole they prefer it to be a death\xe2\x80\x94every one wants to see\r\nyou. They insist upon seeing you. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing to say; they\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care a rap for you; but you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go to lunch or to tea or to\r\ndinner, and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t you\xe2\x80\x99re damned. It\xe2\x80\x99s the smell of blood,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t blame \xe2\x80\x99em; only they shan\xe2\x80\x99t have mine if I know\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked about her as if she had called up a legion of human beings,\r\nall hostile and all disagreeable, who encircled the table, with mouths\r\ngaping for blood, and made it appear a little island of neutral country\r\nin the midst of the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s country.\r\n\r\nHer words roused her husband, who had been muttering rhythmically to\r\nhimself, surveying his guests and his food and his wife with eyes that\r\nwere now melancholy and now fierce, according to the fortunes of the\r\nlady in his ballad. He cut Helen short with a protest. He hated even\r\nthe semblance of cynicism in women. \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\nTerence and Rachel glanced at each other across the table, which meant\r\nthat when they were married they would not behave like that. The\r\nentrance of Ridley into the conversation had a strange effect. It\r\nbecame at once more formal and more polite. It would have been\r\nimpossible to talk quite easily of anything that came into their heads,\r\nand to say the word prostitute as simply as any other word. The talk\r\nnow turned upon literature and politics, and Ridley told stories of the\r\ndistinguished people he had known in his youth. Such talk was of the\r\nnature of an art, and the personalities and informalities of the young\r\nwere silenced. As they rose to go, Helen stopped for a moment, leaning\r\nher elbows on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve all been sitting here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor almost an hour, and you\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t noticed my figs, or my flowers, or the way the light comes\r\nthrough, or anything. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been listening, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nlooking at you. You looked very beautiful; I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d go on sitting\r\nfor ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe led the way to the drawing-room, where she took up her embroidery,\r\nand began again to dissuade Terence from walking down to the hotel in\r\nthis heat. But the more she dissuaded, the more he was determined to\r\ngo. He became irritated and obstinate. There were moments when they\r\nalmost disliked each other. He wanted other people; he wanted Rachel,\r\nto see them with him. He suspected that Mrs. Ambrose would now try to\r\ndissuade her from going. He was annoyed by all this space and shade and\r\nbeauty, and Hirst, recumbent, drooping a magazine from his wrist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cRachel needn\xe2\x80\x99t come unless she wants to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you go, Hewet, I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d make enquiries about the prostitute,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Hirst. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll walk half the way with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGreatly to their surprise he raised himself, looked at his watch, and\r\nremarked that, as it was now half an hour since luncheon, the gastric\r\njuices had had sufficient time to secrete; he was trying a system, he\r\nexplained, which involved short spells of exercise interspaced by\r\nlonger intervals of rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be back at four,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked to Helen, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I shall lie down\r\non the sofa and relax all my muscles completely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99re going, Rachel?\xe2\x80\x9d Helen asked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t stay with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled, but she might have been sad.\r\n\r\nWas she sad, or was she really laughing? Rachel could not tell, and she\r\nfelt for the moment very uncomfortable between Helen and Terence. Then\r\nshe turned away, saying merely that she would go with Terence, on\r\ncondition that he did all the talking.\r\n\r\nA narrow border of shadow ran along the road, which was broad enough\r\nfor two, but not broad enough for three. St. John therefore dropped a\r\nlittle behind the pair, and the distance between them increased by\r\ndegrees. Walking with a view to digestion, and with one eye upon his\r\nwatch, he looked from time to time at the pair in front of him. They\r\nseemed to be so happy, so intimate, although they were walking side by\r\nside much as other people walk. They turned slightly toward each other\r\nnow and then, and said something which he thought must be something\r\nvery private. They were really disputing about Helen\xe2\x80\x99s character, and\r\nTerence was trying to explain why it was that she annoyed him so much\r\nsometimes. But St. John thought that they were saying things which they\r\ndid not want him to hear, and was led to think of his own isolation.\r\nThese people were happy, and in some ways he despised them for being\r\nmade happy so simply, and in other ways he envied them. He was much\r\nmore remarkable than they were, but he was not happy. People never\r\nliked him; he doubted sometimes whether even Helen liked him. To be\r\nsimple, to be able to say simply what one felt, without the terrific\r\nself-consciousness which possessed him, and showed him his own face and\r\nwords perpetually in a mirror, that would be worth almost any other\r\ngift, for it made one happy. Happiness, happiness, what was happiness?\r\nHe was never happy. He saw too clearly the little vices and deceits and\r\nflaws of life, and, seeing them, it seemed to him honest to take notice\r\nof them. That was the reason, no doubt, why people generally disliked\r\nhim, and complained that he was heartless and bitter. Certainly they\r\nnever told him the things he wanted to be told, that he was nice and\r\nkind, and that they liked him. But it was true that half the sharp\r\nthings that he said about them were said because he was unhappy or hurt\r\nhimself. But he admitted that he had very seldom told any one that he\r\ncared for them, and when he had been demonstrative, he had generally\r\nregretted it afterwards. His feelings about Terence and Rachel were so\r\ncomplicated that he had never yet been able to bring himself to say\r\nthat he was glad that they were going to be married. He saw their\r\nfaults so clearly, and the inferior nature of a great deal of their\r\nfeeling for each other, and he expected that their love would not last.\r\nHe looked at them again, and, very strangely, for he was so used to\r\nthinking that he seldom saw anything, the look of them filled him with\r\na simple emotion of affection in which there were some traces of pity\r\nalso. What, after all, did people\xe2\x80\x99s faults matter in comparison with\r\nwhat was good in them? He resolved that he would now tell them what he\r\nfelt. He quickened his pace and came up with them just as they reached\r\nthe corner where the lane joined the main road. They stood still and\r\nbegan to laugh at him, and to ask him whether the gastric juices\xe2\x80\x94but he\r\nstopped them and began to speak very quickly and stiffly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you remember the morning after the dance?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was here\r\nwe sat, and you talked nonsense, and Rachel made little heaps of\r\nstones. I, on the other hand, had the whole meaning of life revealed to\r\nme in a flash.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused for a second, and drew his lips together in a\r\ntight little purse. \xe2\x80\x9cLove,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me to explain\r\neverything. So, on the whole, I\xe2\x80\x99m very glad that you two are going to\r\nbe married.\xe2\x80\x9d He then turned round abruptly, without looking at them,\r\nand walked back to the villa. He felt both exalted and ashamed of\r\nhimself for having thus said what he felt. Probably they were laughing\r\nat him, probably they thought him a fool, and, after all, had he really\r\nsaid what he felt?\r\n\r\nIt was true that they laughed when he was gone; but the dispute about\r\nHelen which had become rather sharp, ceased, and they became peaceful\r\nand friendly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThey reached the hotel rather early in the afternoon, so that most\r\npeople were still lying down, or sitting speechless in their bedrooms,\r\nand Mrs. Thornbury, although she had asked them to tea, was nowhere to\r\nbe seen. They sat down, therefore, in the shady hall, which was almost\r\nempty, and full of the light swishing sounds of air going to and fro in\r\na large empty space. Yes, this arm-chair was the same arm-chair in\r\nwhich Rachel had sat that afternoon when Evelyn came up, and this was\r\nthe magazine she had been looking at, and this the very picture, a\r\npicture of New York by lamplight. How odd it seemed\xe2\x80\x94nothing had\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nBy degrees a certain number of people began to come down the stairs and\r\nto pass through the hall, and in this dim light their figures possessed\r\na sort of grace and beauty, although they were all unknown people.\r\nSometimes they went straight through and out into the garden by the\r\nswing door, sometimes they stopped for a few minutes and bent over the\r\ntables and began turning over the newspapers. Terence and Rachel sat\r\nwatching them through their half-closed eyelids\xe2\x80\x94the Johnsons, the\r\nParkers, the Baileys, the Simmons\xe2\x80\x99, the Lees, the Morleys, the\r\nCampbells, the Gardiners. Some were dressed in white flannels and were\r\ncarrying racquets under their arms, some were short, some tall, some\r\nwere only children, and some perhaps were servants, but they all had\r\ntheir standing, their reason for following each other through the hall,\r\ntheir money, their position, whatever it might be. Terence soon gave up\r\nlooking at them, for he was tired; and, closing his eyes, he fell half\r\nasleep in his chair. Rachel watched the people for some time longer;\r\nshe was fascinated by the certainty and the grace of their movements,\r\nand by the inevitable way in which they seemed to follow each other,\r\nand loiter and pass on and disappear. But after a time her thoughts\r\nwandered, and she began to think of the dance, which had been held in\r\nthis room, only then the room itself looked quite different. Glancing\r\nround, she could hardly believe that it was the same room. It had\r\nlooked so bare and so bright and formal on that night when they came\r\ninto it out of the darkness; it had been filled, too, with little red,\r\nexcited faces, always moving, and people so brightly dressed and so\r\nanimated that they did not seem in the least like real people, nor did\r\nyou feel that you could talk to them. And now the room was dim and\r\nquiet, and beautiful silent people passed through it, to whom you could\r\ngo and say anything you liked. She felt herself amazingly secure as she\r\nsat in her arm-chair, and able to review not only the night of the\r\ndance, but the entire past, tenderly and humorously, as if she had been\r\nturning in a fog for a long time, and could now see exactly where she\r\nhad turned. For the methods by which she had reached her present\r\nposition, seemed to her very strange, and the strangest thing about\r\nthem was that she had not known where they were leading her. That was\r\nthe strange thing, that one did not know where one was going, or what\r\none wanted, and followed blindly, suffering so much in secret, always\r\nunprepared and amazed and knowing nothing; but one thing led to another\r\nand by degrees something had formed itself out of nothing, and so one\r\nreached at last this calm, this quiet, this certainty, and it was this\r\nprocess that people called living. Perhaps, then, every one really knew\r\nas she knew now where they were going; and things formed themselves\r\ninto a pattern not only for her, but for them, and in that pattern lay\r\nsatisfaction and meaning. When she looked back she could see that a\r\nmeaning of some kind was apparent in the lives of her aunts, and in the\r\nbrief visit of the Dalloways whom she would never see again, and in the\r\nlife of her father.\r\n\r\nThe sound of Terence, breathing deep in his slumber, confirmed her in\r\nher calm. She was not sleepy although she did not see anything very\r\ndistinctly, but although the figures passing through the hall became\r\nvaguer and vaguer, she believed that they all knew exactly where they\r\nwere going, and the sense of their certainty filled her with comfort.\r\nFor the moment she was as detached and disinterested as if she had no\r\nlonger any lot in life, and she thought that she could now accept\r\nanything that came to her without being perplexed by the form in which\r\nit appeared. What was there to frighten or to perplex in the prospect\r\nof life? Why should this insight ever again desert her? The world was\r\nin truth so large, so hospitable, and after all it was so simple.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove,\xe2\x80\x9d St. John had said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat seems to explain it all.\xe2\x80\x9d Yes, but it\r\nwas not the love of man for woman, of Terence for Rachel. Although they\r\nsat so close together, they had ceased to be little separate bodies;\r\nthey had ceased to struggle and desire one another. There seemed to be\r\npeace between them. It might be love, but it was not the love of man\r\nfor woman.\r\n\r\nThrough her half-closed eyelids she watched Terence lying back in his\r\nchair, and she smiled as she saw how big his mouth was, and his chin so\r\nsmall, and his nose curved like a switchback with a knob at the end.\r\nNaturally, looking like that he was lazy, and ambitious, and full of\r\nmoods and faults. She remembered their quarrels, and in particular how\r\nthey had been quarreling about Helen that very afternoon, and she\r\nthought how often they would quarrel in the thirty, or forty, or fifty\r\nyears in which they would be living in the same house together,\r\ncatching trains together, and getting annoyed because they were so\r\ndifferent. But all this was superficial, and had nothing to do with the\r\nlife that went on beneath the eyes and the mouth and the chin, for that\r\nlife was independent of her, and independent of everything else. So\r\ntoo, although she was going to marry him and to live with him for\r\nthirty, or forty, or fifty years, and to quarrel, and to be so close to\r\nhim, she was independent of him; she was independent of everything\r\nelse. Nevertheless, as St. John said, it was love that made her\r\nunderstand this, for she had never felt this independence, this calm,\r\nand this certainty until she fell in love with him, and perhaps this\r\ntoo was love. She wanted nothing else.\r\n\r\nFor perhaps two minutes Miss Allan had been standing at a little\r\ndistance looking at the couple lying back so peacefully in their\r\narm-chairs. She could not make up her mind whether to disturb them or\r\nnot, and then, seeming to recollect something, she came across the\r\nhall. The sound of her approach woke Terence, who sat up and rubbed his\r\neyes. He heard Miss Allan talking to Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is very nice. It is very nice indeed.\r\nGetting engaged seems to be quite the fashion. It cannot often happen\r\nthat two couples who have never seen each other before meet in the same\r\nhotel and decide to get married.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she paused and smiled, and\r\nseemed to have nothing more to say, so that Terence rose and asked her\r\nwhether it was true that she had finished her book. Some one had said\r\nthat she had really finished it. Her face lit up; she turned to him\r\nwith a livelier expression than usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think I can fairly say I have finished it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is,\r\nomitting Swinburne\xe2\x80\x94Beowulf to Browning\xe2\x80\x94I rather like the two B\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmyself. Beowulf to Browning,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cI think that is the kind\r\nof title which might catch one\xe2\x80\x99s eye on a railway book-stall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was indeed very proud that she had finished her book, for no one\r\nknew what an amount of determination had gone to the making of it. Also\r\nshe thought that it was a good piece of work, and, considering what\r\nanxiety she had been in about her brother while she wrote it, she could\r\nnot resist telling them a little more about it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must confess,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if I had known how many classics\r\nthere are in English literature, and how verbose the best of them\r\ncontrive to be, I should never have undertaken the work. They only\r\nallow one seventy thousand words, you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly seventy thousand words!\xe2\x80\x9d Terence exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and one has to say something about everybody,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Allan added.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I find so difficult, saying something different about\r\neverybody.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she thought that she had said enough about herself,\r\nand she asked whether they had come down to join the tennis tournament.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe young people are very keen about it. It begins again in half an\r\nhour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer gaze rested benevolently upon them both, and, after a momentary\r\npause, she remarked, looking at Rachel as if she had remembered\r\nsomething that would serve to keep her distinct from other people.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re the remarkable person who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like ginger.\xe2\x80\x9d But the\r\nkindness of the smile in her rather worn and courageous face made them\r\nfeel that although she would scarcely remember them as individuals, she\r\nhad laid upon them the burden of the new generation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in that I quite agree with her,\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice behind; Mrs.\r\nThornbury had overheard the last few words about not liking ginger.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s associated in my mind with a horrid old aunt of ours (poor thing,\r\nshe suffered dreadfully, so it isn\xe2\x80\x99t fair to call her horrid) who used\r\nto give it to us when we were small, and we never had the courage to\r\ntell her we didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it. We just had to put it out in the\r\nshrubbery\xe2\x80\x94she had a big house near Bath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey began moving slowly across the hall, when they were stopped by the\r\nimpact of Evelyn, who dashed into them, as though in running downstairs\r\nto catch them her legs had got beyond her control.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, with her usual enthusiasm, seizing Rachel by the\r\narm, \xe2\x80\x9cI call this splendid! I guessed it was going to happen from the\r\nvery beginning! I saw you two were made for each other. Now you\xe2\x80\x99ve just\r\ngot to tell me all about it\xe2\x80\x94when\xe2\x80\x99s it to be, where are you going to\r\nlive\xe2\x80\x94are you both tremendously happy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the attention of the group was diverted to Mrs. Elliot, who was\r\npassing them with her eager but uncertain movement, carrying in her\r\nhands a plate and an empty hot-water bottle. She would have passed\r\nthem, but Mrs. Thornbury went up and stopped her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Hughling\xe2\x80\x99s better,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, in answer to Mrs.\r\nThornbury\xe2\x80\x99s enquiry, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he\xe2\x80\x99s not an easy patient. He wants to know\r\nwhat his temperature is, and if I tell him he gets anxious, and if I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t tell him he suspects. You know what men are when they\xe2\x80\x99re ill! And\r\nof course there are none of the proper appliances, and, though he seems\r\nvery willing and anxious to help\xe2\x80\x9d (here she lowered her voice\r\nmysteriously), \xe2\x80\x9cone can\xe2\x80\x99t feel that Dr. Rodriguez is the same as a\r\nproper doctor. If you would come and see him, Mr. Hewet,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow it would cheer him up\xe2\x80\x94lying there in bed all day\xe2\x80\x94and the flies\xe2\x80\x94But\r\nI must go and find Angelo\xe2\x80\x94the food here\xe2\x80\x94of course, with an invalid, one\r\nwants things particularly nice.\xe2\x80\x9d And she hurried past them in search of\r\nthe head waiter. The worry of nursing her husband had fixed a plaintive\r\nfrown upon her forehead; she was pale and looked unhappy and more than\r\nusually inefficient, and her eyes wandered more vaguely than ever from\r\npoint to point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor thing!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Thornbury exclaimed. She told them that for some\r\ndays Hughling Elliot had been ill, and the only doctor available was\r\nthe brother of the proprietor, or so the proprietor said, whose right\r\nto the title of doctor was not above suspicion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know how wretched it is to be ill in a hotel,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Thornbury\r\nremarked, once more leading the way with Rachel to the garden. \xe2\x80\x9cI spent\r\nsix weeks on my honeymoon in having typhoid at Venice,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut even so, I look back upon them as some of the happiest weeks in my\r\nlife. Ah, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, taking Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s arm, \xe2\x80\x9cyou think yourself\r\nhappy now, but it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to the happiness that comes afterwards. And\r\nI assure you I could find it in my heart to envy you young people!\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve a much better time than we had, I may tell you. When I look back\r\nupon it, I can hardly believe how things have changed. When we were\r\nengaged I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to go for walks with William alone\xe2\x80\x94some one\r\nhad always to be in the room with us\xe2\x80\x94I really believe I had to show my\r\nparents all his letters!\xe2\x80\x94though they were very fond of him too. Indeed,\r\nI may say they looked upon him as their own son. It amuses me,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cto think how strict they were to us, when I see how they\r\nspoil their grand-children!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe table was laid under the tree again, and taking her place before\r\nthe teacups, Mrs. Thornbury beckoned and nodded until she had collected\r\nquite a number of people, Susan and Arthur and Mr. Pepper, who were\r\nstrolling about, waiting for the tournament to begin. A murmuring tree,\r\na river brimming in the moonlight, Terence\xe2\x80\x99s words came back to Rachel\r\nas she sat drinking the tea and listening to the words which flowed on\r\nso lightly, so kindly, and with such silvery smoothness. This long life\r\nand all these children had left her very smooth; they seemed to have\r\nrubbed away the marks of individuality, and to have left only what was\r\nold and maternal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the things you young people are going to see!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Thornbury\r\ncontinued. She included them all in her forecast, she included them all\r\nin her maternity, although the party comprised William Pepper and Miss\r\nAllan, both of whom might have been supposed to have seen a fair share\r\nof the panorama. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I see how the world has changed in my lifetime,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI can set no limit to what may happen in the next fifty\r\nyears. Ah, no, Mr. Pepper, I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with you in the least,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nlaughed, interrupting his gloomy remark about things going steadily\r\nfrom bad to worse. \xe2\x80\x9cI know I ought to feel that, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid. They\xe2\x80\x99re going to be much better people than we were. Surely\r\neverything goes to prove that. All round me I see women, young women,\r\nwomen with household cares of every sort, going out and doing things\r\nthat we should not have thought it possible to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Pepper thought her sentimental and irrational like all old women,\r\nbut her manner of treating him as if he were a cross old baby baffled\r\nhim and charmed him, and he could only reply to her with a curious\r\ngrimace which was more a smile than a frown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they remain women,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Thornbury added. \xe2\x80\x9cThey give a great deal\r\nto their children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she said this she smiled slightly in the direction of Susan and\r\nRachel. They did not like to be included in the same lot, but they both\r\nsmiled a little self-consciously, and Arthur and Terence glanced at\r\neach other too. She made them feel that they were all in the same boat\r\ntogether, and they looked at the women they were going to marry and\r\ncompared them. It was inexplicable how any one could wish to marry\r\nRachel, incredible that any one should be ready to spend his life with\r\nSusan; but singular though the other\xe2\x80\x99s taste must be, they bore each\r\nother no ill-will on account of it; indeed, they liked each other\r\nrather the better for the eccentricity of their choice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really must congratulate you,\xe2\x80\x9d Susan remarked, as she leant across\r\nthe table for the jam.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be no foundation for St. John\xe2\x80\x99s gossip about Arthur and\r\nSusan. Sunburnt and vigorous they sat side by side, with their racquets\r\nacross their knees, not saying much but smiling slightly all the time.\r\nThrough the thin white clothes which they wore, it was possible to see\r\nthe lines of their bodies and legs, the beautiful curves of their\r\nmuscles, his leanness and her flesh, and it was natural to think of the\r\nfirm-fleshed sturdy children that would be theirs. Their faces had too\r\nlittle shape in them to be beautiful, but they had clear eyes and an\r\nappearance of great health and power of endurance, for it seemed as if\r\nthe blood would never cease to run in his veins, or to lie deeply and\r\ncalmly in her cheeks. Their eyes at the present moment were brighter\r\nthan usual, and wore the peculiar expression of pleasure and\r\nself-confidence which is seen in the eyes of athletes, for they had\r\nbeen playing tennis, and they were both first-rate at the game.\r\n\r\nEvelyn had not spoken, but she had been looking from Susan to Rachel.\r\nWell\xe2\x80\x94they had both made up their minds very easily, they had done in a\r\nvery few weeks what it sometimes seemed to her that she would never be\r\nable to do. Although they were so different, she thought that she could\r\nsee in each the same look of satisfaction and completion, the same\r\ncalmness of manner, and the same slowness of movement. It was that\r\nslowness, that confidence, that content which she hated, she thought to\r\nherself. They moved so slowly because they were not single but double,\r\nand Susan was attached to Arthur, and Rachel to Terence, and for the\r\nsake of this one man they had renounced all other men, and movement,\r\nand the real things of life. Love was all very well, and those snug\r\ndomestic houses, with the kitchen below and the nursery above, which\r\nwere so secluded and self-contained, like little islands in the\r\ntorrents of the world; but the real things were surely the things that\r\nhappened, the causes, the wars, the ideals, which happened in the great\r\nworld outside, and went so independently of these women, turning so\r\nquietly and beautifully towards the men. She looked at them sharply. Of\r\ncourse they were happy and content, but there must be better things\r\nthan that. Surely one could get nearer to life, one could get more out\r\nof life, one could enjoy more and feel more than they would ever do.\r\nRachel in particular looked so young\xe2\x80\x94what could she know of life? She\r\nbecame restless, and getting up, crossed over to sit beside Rachel. She\r\nreminded her that she had promised to join her club.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bother is,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I mayn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to start work\r\nseriously till October. I\xe2\x80\x99ve just had a letter from a friend of mine\r\nwhose brother is in business in Moscow. They want me to stay with them,\r\nand as they\xe2\x80\x99re in the thick of all the conspiracies and anarchists,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve a good mind to stop on my way home. It sounds too thrilling.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nwanted to make Rachel see how thrilling it was. \xe2\x80\x9cMy friend knows a girl\r\nof fifteen who\xe2\x80\x99s been sent to Siberia for life merely because they\r\ncaught her addressing a letter to an anarchist. And the letter wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfrom her, either. I\xe2\x80\x99d give all I have in the world to help on a\r\nrevolution against the Russian government, and it\xe2\x80\x99s bound to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked from Rachel to Terence. They were both a little touched by\r\nthe sight of her remembering how lately they had been listening to evil\r\nwords about her, and Terence asked her what her scheme was, and she\r\nexplained that she was going to found a club\xe2\x80\x94a club for doing things,\r\nreally doing them. She became very animated, as she talked on and on,\r\nfor she professed herself certain that if once twenty people\xe2\x80\x94no, ten\r\nwould be enough if they were keen\xe2\x80\x94set about doing things instead of\r\ntalking about doing them, they could abolish almost every evil that\r\nexists. It was brains that were needed. If only people with brains\xe2\x80\x94of\r\ncourse they would want a room, a nice room, in Bloomsbury preferably,\r\nwhere they could meet once a week. . . .\r\n\r\nAs she talked Terence could see the traces of fading youth in her face,\r\nthe lines that were being drawn by talk and excitement round her mouth\r\nand eyes, but he did not pity her; looking into those bright, rather\r\nhard, and very courageous eyes, he saw that she did not pity herself,\r\nor feel any desire to exchange her own life for the more refined and\r\norderly lives of people like himself and St. John, although, as the\r\nyears went by, the fight would become harder and harder. Perhaps,\r\nthough, she would settle down; perhaps, after all, she would marry\r\nPerrott. While his mind was half occupied with what she was saying, he\r\nthought of her probable destiny, the light clouds of tobacco smoke\r\nserving to obscure his face from her eyes.\r\n\r\nTerence smoked and Arthur smoked and Evelyn smoked, so that the air was\r\nfull of the mist and fragrance of good tobacco. In the intervals when\r\nno one spoke, they heard far off the low murmur of the sea, as the\r\nwaves quietly broke and spread the beach with a film of water, and\r\nwithdrew to break again. The cool green light fell through the leaves\r\nof the tree, and there were soft crescents and diamonds of sunshine\r\nupon the plates and the tablecloth. Mrs. Thornbury, after watching them\r\nall for a time in silence, began to ask Rachel kindly questions\xe2\x80\x94When\r\ndid they all go back? Oh, they expected her father. She must want to\r\nsee her father\xe2\x80\x94there would be a great deal to tell him, and (she looked\r\nsympathetically at Terence) he would be so happy, she felt sure. Years\r\nago, she continued, it might have been ten or twenty years ago, she\r\nremembered meeting Mr. Vinrace at a party, and, being so much struck by\r\nhis face, which was so unlike the ordinary face one sees at a party,\r\nthat she had asked who he was, and she was told that it was Mr.\r\nVinrace, and she had always remembered the name,\xe2\x80\x94an uncommon name,\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nhe had a lady with him, a very sweet-looking woman, but it was one of\r\nthose dreadful London crushes, where you don\xe2\x80\x99t talk,\xe2\x80\x94you only look at\r\neach other,\xe2\x80\x94and although she had shaken hands with Mr. Vinrace, she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t think they had said anything. She sighed very slightly,\r\nremembering the past.\r\n\r\nThen she turned to Mr. Pepper, who had become very dependent on her, so\r\nthat he always chose a seat near her, and attended to what she was\r\nsaying, although he did not often make any remark of his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou who know everything, Mr. Pepper,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9ctell us how did those\r\nwonderful French ladies manage their salons? Did we ever do anything of\r\nthe same kind in England, or do you think that there is some reason why\r\nwe cannot do it in England?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Pepper was pleased to explain very accurately why there has never\r\nbeen an English salon. There were three reasons, and they were very\r\ngood ones, he said. As for himself, when he went to a party, as one was\r\nsometimes obliged to, from a wish not to give offence\xe2\x80\x94his niece, for\r\nexample, had been married the other day\xe2\x80\x94he walked into the middle of\r\nthe room, said \xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d as loud as ever he could, considered that he\r\nhad done his duty, and walked away again. Mrs. Thornbury protested. She\r\nwas going to give a party directly she got back, and they were all to\r\nbe invited, and she should set people to watch Mr. Pepper, and if she\r\nheard that he had been caught saying \xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d she would\xe2\x80\x94she would do\r\nsomething very dreadful indeed to him. Arthur Venning suggested that\r\nwhat she must do was to rig up something in the nature of a surprise\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nportrait, for example, of a nice old lady in a lace cap, concealing a\r\nbath of cold water, which at a signal could be sprung on Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s head;\r\nor they\xe2\x80\x99d have a chair which shot him twenty feet high directly he sat\r\non it.\r\n\r\nSusan laughed. She had done her tea; she was feeling very well\r\ncontented, partly because she had been playing tennis brilliantly, and\r\nthen every one was so nice; she was beginning to find it so much easier\r\nto talk, and to hold her own even with quite clever people, for somehow\r\nclever people did not frighten her any more. Even Mr. Hirst, whom she\r\nhad disliked when she first met him, really wasn\xe2\x80\x99t disagreeable; and,\r\npoor man, he always looked so ill; perhaps he was in love; perhaps he\r\nhad been in love with Rachel\xe2\x80\x94she really shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder; or perhaps it\r\nwas Evelyn\xe2\x80\x94she was of course very attractive to men. Leaning forward,\r\nshe went on with the conversation. She said that she thought that the\r\nreason why parties were so dull was mainly because gentlemen will not\r\ndress: even in London, she stated, it struck her very much how people\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think it necessary to dress in the evening, and of course if they\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t dress in London they won\xe2\x80\x99t dress in the country. It was really\r\nquite a treat at Christmas-time when there were the Hunt balls, and the\r\ngentlemen wore nice red coats, but Arthur didn\xe2\x80\x99t care for dancing, so\r\nshe supposed that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go even to the ball in their little\r\ncountry town. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t think that people who were fond of one sport\r\noften care for another, although her father was an exception. But then\r\nhe was an exception in every way\xe2\x80\x94such a gardener, and he knew all about\r\nbirds and animals, and of course he was simply adored by all the old\r\nwomen in the village, and at the same time what he really liked best\r\nwas a book. You always knew where to find him if he were wanted; he\r\nwould be in his study with a book. Very likely it would be an old, old\r\nbook, some fusty old thing that no one else would dream of reading. She\r\nused to tell him that he would have made a first-rate old bookworm if\r\nonly he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had a family of six to support, and six children, she\r\nadded, charmingly confident of universal sympathy, didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave one\r\nmuch time for being a bookworm.\r\n\r\nStill talking about her father, of whom she was very proud, she rose,\r\nfor Arthur upon looking at his watch found that it was time they went\r\nback again to the tennis court. The others did not move.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re very happy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Thornbury, looking benignantly after\r\nthem. Rachel agreed; they seemed to be so certain of themselves; they\r\nseemed to know exactly what they wanted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you think they _are_ happy?\xe2\x80\x9d Evelyn murmured to Terence in an\r\nundertone, and she hoped that he would say that he did not think them\r\nhappy; but, instead, he said that they must go too\xe2\x80\x94go home, for they\r\nwere always being late for meals, and Mrs. Ambrose, who was very stern\r\nand particular, didn\xe2\x80\x99t like that. Evelyn laid hold of Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s skirt\r\nand protested. Why should they go? It was still early, and she had so\r\nmany things to say to them. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Terence, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must go, because we\r\nwalk so slowly. We stop and look at things, and we talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you talk about?\xe2\x80\x9d Evelyn enquired, upon which he laughed and\r\nsaid that they talked about everything.\r\n\r\nMrs. Thornbury went with them to the gate, trailing very slowly and\r\ngracefully across the grass and the gravel, and talking all the time\r\nabout flowers and birds. She told them that she had taken up the study\r\nof botany since her daughter married, and it was wonderful what a\r\nnumber of flowers there were which she had never seen, although she had\r\nlived in the country all her life and she was now seventy-two. It was a\r\ngood thing to have some occupation which was quite independent of other\r\npeople, she said, when one got old. But the odd thing was that one\r\nnever felt old. She always felt that she was twenty-five, not a day\r\nmore or a day less, but, of course, one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect other people to\r\nagree to that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be very wonderful to be twenty-five, and not merely to imagine\r\nthat you\xe2\x80\x99re twenty-five,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking from one to the other with\r\nher smooth, bright glance. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be very wonderful, very wonderful\r\nindeed.\xe2\x80\x9d She stood talking to them at the gate for a long time; she\r\nseemed reluctant that they should go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was very hot, so hot that the breaking of the waves on\r\nthe shore sounded like the repeated sigh of some exhausted creature,\r\nand even on the terrace under an awning the bricks were hot, and the\r\nair danced perpetually over the short dry grass. The red flowers in the\r\nstone basins were drooping with the heat, and the white blossoms which\r\nhad been so smooth and thick only a few weeks ago were now dry, and\r\ntheir edges were curled and yellow. Only the stiff and hostile plants\r\nof the south, whose fleshy leaves seemed to be grown upon spines, still\r\nremained standing upright and defied the sun to beat them down. It was\r\ntoo hot to talk, and it was not easy to find any book that would\r\nwithstand the power of the sun. Many books had been tried and then let\r\nfall, and now Terence was reading Milton aloud, because he said the\r\nwords of Milton had substance and shape, so that it was not necessary\r\nto understand what he was saying; one could merely listen to his words;\r\none could almost handle them.\r\n\r\nThere is a gentle nymph not far from hence,\r\n\r\n\r\nhe read,\r\n\r\nThat with moist curb sways the smooth Severn stream.\r\nSabrina is her name, a virgin pure;\r\nWhilom she was the daughter of Locrine,\r\nThat had the sceptre from his father Brute.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe words, in spite of what Terence had said, seemed to be laden with\r\nmeaning, and perhaps it was for this reason that it was painful to\r\nlisten to them; they sounded strange; they meant different things from\r\nwhat they usually meant. Rachel at any rate could not keep her\r\nattention fixed upon them, but went off upon curious trains of thought\r\nsuggested by words such as \xe2\x80\x9ccurb\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cLocrine\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cBrute,\xe2\x80\x9d which\r\nbrought unpleasant sights before her eyes, independently of their\r\nmeaning. Owing to the heat and the dancing air the garden too looked\r\nstrange\xe2\x80\x94the trees were either too near or too far, and her head almost\r\ncertainly ached. She was not quite certain, and therefore she did not\r\nknow, whether to tell Terence now, or to let him go on reading. She\r\ndecided that she would wait until he came to the end of a stanza, and\r\nif by that time she had turned her head this way and that, and it ached\r\nin every position undoubtedly, she would say very calmly that her head\r\nached.\r\n\r\nSabrina fair,\r\n    Listen where thou art sitting\r\nUnder the glassy, cool, translucent wave,\r\n    In twisted braids of lilies knitting\r\nThe loose train of thy amber dropping hair,\r\nListen for dear honour\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\r\n    Goddess of the silver lake,\r\n    Listen and save!\r\n\r\n\r\nBut her head ached; it ached whichever way she turned it.\r\n\r\nShe sat up and said as she had determined, \xe2\x80\x9cMy head aches so that I\r\nshall go indoors.\xe2\x80\x9d He was half-way through the next verse, but he\r\ndropped the book instantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour head aches?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments they sat looking at one another in silence, holding\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s hands. During this time his sense of dismay and\r\ncatastrophe were almost physically painful; all round him he seemed to\r\nhear the shiver of broken glass which, as it fell to earth, left him\r\nsitting in the open air. But at the end of two minutes, noticing that\r\nshe was not sharing his dismay, but was only rather more languid and\r\nheavy-eyed than usual, he recovered, fetched Helen, and asked her to\r\ntell him what they had better do, for Rachel had a headache.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ambrose was not discomposed, but advised that she should go to\r\nbed, and added that she must expect her head to ache if she sat up to\r\nall hours and went out in the heat, but a few hours in bed would cure\r\nit completely. Terence was unreasonably reassured by her words, as he\r\nhad been unreasonably depressed the moment before. Helen\xe2\x80\x99s sense seemed\r\nto have much in common with the ruthless good sense of nature, which\r\navenged rashness by a headache, and, like nature\xe2\x80\x99s good sense, might be\r\ndepended upon.\r\n\r\nRachel went to bed; she lay in the dark, it seemed to her, for a very\r\nlong time, but at length, waking from a transparent kind of sleep, she\r\nsaw the windows white in front of her, and recollected that some time\r\nbefore she had gone to bed with a headache, and that Helen had said it\r\nwould be gone when she woke. She supposed, therefore, that she was now\r\nquite well again. At the same time the wall of her room was painfully\r\nwhite, and curved slightly, instead of being straight and flat. Turning\r\nher eyes to the window, she was not reassured by what she saw there.\r\nThe movement of the blind as it filled with air and blew slowly out,\r\ndrawing the cord with a little trailing sound along the floor, seemed\r\nto her terrifying, as if it were the movement of an animal in the room.\r\nShe shut her eyes, and the pulse in her head beat so strongly that each\r\nthump seemed to tread upon a nerve, piercing her forehead with a little\r\nstab of pain. It might not be the same headache, but she certainly had\r\na headache. She turned from side to side, in the hope that the coolness\r\nof the sheets would cure her, and that when she next opened her eyes to\r\nlook the room would be as usual. After a considerable number of vain\r\nexperiments, she resolved to put the matter beyond a doubt. She got out\r\nof bed and stood upright, holding on to the brass ball at the end of\r\nthe bedstead. Ice-cold at first, it soon became as hot as the palm of\r\nher hand, and as the pains in her head and body and the instability of\r\nthe floor proved that it would be far more intolerable to stand and\r\nwalk than to lie in bed, she got into bed again; but though the change\r\nwas refreshing at first, the discomfort of bed was soon as great as the\r\ndiscomfort of standing up. She accepted the idea that she would have to\r\nstay in bed all day long, and as she laid her head on the pillow,\r\nrelinquished the happiness of the day.\r\n\r\nWhen Helen came in an hour or two later, suddenly stopped her cheerful\r\nwords, looked startled for a second and then unnaturally calm, the fact\r\nthat she was ill was put beyond a doubt. It was confirmed when the\r\nwhole household knew of it, when the song that some one was singing in\r\nthe garden stopped suddenly, and when Maria, as she brought water,\r\nslipped past the bed with averted eyes. There was all the morning to\r\nget through, and then all the afternoon, and at intervals she made an\r\neffort to cross over into the ordinary world, but she found that her\r\nheat and discomfort had put a gulf between her world and the ordinary\r\nworld which she could not bridge. At one point the door opened, and\r\nHelen came in with a little dark man who had\xe2\x80\x94it was the chief thing she\r\nnoticed about him\xe2\x80\x94very hairy hands. She was drowsy and intolerably hot,\r\nand as he seemed shy and obsequious she scarcely troubled to answer\r\nhim, although she understood that he was a doctor. At another point the\r\ndoor opened and Terence came in very gently, smiling too steadily, as\r\nshe realised, for it to be natural. He sat down and talked to her,\r\nstroking her hands until it became irksome to her to lie any more in\r\nthe same position and she turned round, and when she looked up again\r\nHelen was beside her and Terence had gone. It did not matter; she would\r\nsee him to-morrow when things would be ordinary again. Her chief\r\noccupation during the day was to try to remember how the lines went:\r\n\r\nUnder the glassy, cool, translucent wave,\r\nIn twisted braids of lilies knitting\r\nThe loose train of thy amber dropping hair;\r\n\r\n\r\nand the effort worried her because the adjectives persisted in getting\r\ninto the wrong places.\r\n\r\nThe second day did not differ very much from the first day, except that\r\nher bed had become very important, and the world outside, when she\r\ntried to think of it, appeared distinctly further off. The glassy,\r\ncool, translucent wave was almost visible before her, curling up at the\r\nend of the bed, and as it was refreshingly cool she tried to keep her\r\nmind fixed upon it. Helen was here, and Helen was there all day long;\r\nsometimes she said that it was lunchtime, and sometimes that it was\r\nteatime; but by the next day all landmarks were obliterated, and the\r\nouter world was so far away that the different sounds, such as the\r\nsounds of people moving overhead, could only be ascribed to their cause\r\nby a great effort of memory. The recollection of what she had felt, or\r\nof what she had been doing and thinking three days before, had faded\r\nentirely. On the other hand, every object in the room, and the bed\r\nitself, and her own body with its various limbs and their different\r\nsensations were more and more important each day. She was completely\r\ncut off, and unable to communicate with the rest of the world, isolated\r\nalone with her body.\r\n\r\nHours and hours would pass thus, without getting any further through\r\nthe morning, or again a few minutes would lead from broad daylight to\r\nthe depths of the night. One evening when the room appeared very dim,\r\neither because it was evening or because the blinds were drawn, Helen\r\nsaid to her, \xe2\x80\x9cSome one is going to sit here to-night. You won\xe2\x80\x99t mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOpening her eyes, Rachel saw not only Helen but a nurse in spectacles,\r\nwhose face vaguely recalled something that she had once seen. She had\r\nseen her in the chapel. \xe2\x80\x9cNurse McInnis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen, and the nurse\r\nsmiled steadily as they all did, and said that she did not find many\r\npeople who were frightened of her. After waiting for a moment they both\r\ndisappeared, and having turned on her pillow Rachel woke to find\r\nherself in the midst of one of those interminable nights which do not\r\nend at twelve, but go on into the double figures\xe2\x80\x94thirteen, fourteen,\r\nand so on until they reach the twenties, and then the thirties, and\r\nthen the forties. She realised that there is nothing to prevent nights\r\nfrom doing this if they choose. At a great distance an elderly woman\r\nsat with her head bent down; Rachel raised herself slightly and saw\r\nwith dismay that she was playing cards by the light of a candle which\r\nstood in the hollow of a newspaper. The sight had something\r\ninexplicably sinister about it, and she was terrified and cried out,\r\nupon which the woman laid down her cards and came across the room,\r\nshading the candle with her hands. Coming nearer and nearer across the\r\ngreat space of the room, she stood at last above Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s head and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cNot asleep? Let me make you comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put down the candle and began to arrange the bedclothes. It struck\r\nRachel that a woman who sat playing cards in a cavern all night long\r\nwould have very cold hands, and she shrunk from the touch of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there\xe2\x80\x99s a toe all the way down there!\xe2\x80\x9d the woman said, proceeding\r\nto tuck in the bedclothes. Rachel did not realise that the toe was\r\nhers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must try and lie still,\xe2\x80\x9d she proceeded, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause if you lie still\r\nyou will be less hot, and if you toss about you will make yourself more\r\nhot, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to be any hotter than you are.\xe2\x80\x9d She stood\r\nlooking down upon Rachel for an enormous length of time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the quieter you lie the sooner you will be well,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\nRachel kept her eyes fixed upon the peaked shadow on the ceiling, and\r\nall her energy was concentrated upon the desire that this shadow should\r\nmove. But the shadow and the woman seemed to be eternally fixed above\r\nher. She shut her eyes. When she opened them again several more hours\r\nhad passed, but the night still lasted interminably. The woman was\r\nstill playing cards, only she sat now in a tunnel under a river, and\r\nthe light stood in a little archway in the wall above her. She cried\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTerence!\xe2\x80\x9d and the peaked shadow again moved across the ceiling, as the\r\nwoman with an enormous slow movement rose, and they both stood still\r\nabove her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just as difficult to keep you in bed as it was to keep Mr.\r\nForrest in bed,\xe2\x80\x9d the woman said, \xe2\x80\x9cand he was such a tall gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn order to get rid of this terrible stationary sight Rachel again shut\r\nher eyes, and found herself walking through a tunnel under the Thames,\r\nwhere there were little deformed women sitting in archways playing\r\ncards, while the bricks of which the wall was made oozed with damp,\r\nwhich collected into drops and slid down the wall. But the little old\r\nwomen became Helen and Nurse McInnis after a time, standing in the\r\nwindow together whispering, whispering incessantly.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile outside her room the sounds, the movements, and the lives of\r\nthe other people in the house went on in the ordinary light of the sun,\r\nthroughout the usual succession of hours. When, on the first day of her\r\nillness, it became clear that she would not be absolutely well, for her\r\ntemperature was very high, until Friday, that day being Tuesday,\r\nTerence was filled with resentment, not against her, but against the\r\nforce outside them which was separating them. He counted up the number\r\nof days that would almost certainly be spoilt for them. He realised,\r\nwith an odd mixture of pleasure and annoyance, that, for the first time\r\nin his life, he was so dependent upon another person that his happiness\r\nwas in her keeping. The days were completely wasted upon trifling,\r\nimmaterial things, for after three weeks of such intimacy and intensity\r\nall the usual occupations were unbearably flat and beside the point.\r\nThe least intolerable occupation was to talk to St. John about Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nillness, and to discuss every symptom and its meaning, and, when this\r\nsubject was exhausted, to discuss illness of all kinds, and what caused\r\nthem, and what cured them.\r\n\r\nTwice every day he went in to sit with Rachel, and twice every day the\r\nsame thing happened. On going into her room, which was not very dark,\r\nwhere the music was lying about as usual, and her books and letters,\r\nhis spirits rose instantly. When he saw her he felt completely\r\nreassured. She did not look very ill. Sitting by her side he would tell\r\nher what he had been doing, using his natural voice to speak to her,\r\nonly a few tones lower down than usual; but by the time he had sat\r\nthere for five minutes he was plunged into the deepest gloom. She was\r\nnot the same; he could not bring them back to their old relationship;\r\nbut although he knew that it was foolish he could not prevent himself\r\nfrom endeavouring to bring her back, to make her remember, and when\r\nthis failed he was in despair. He always concluded as he left her room\r\nthat it was worse to see her than not to see her, but by degrees, as\r\nthe day wore on, the desire to see her returned and became almost too\r\ngreat to be borne.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday morning when Terence went into her room he felt the usual\r\nincrease of confidence. She turned round and made an effort to remember\r\ncertain facts from the world that was so many millions of miles away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have come up from the hotel?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I\xe2\x80\x99m staying here for the present,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve just had\r\nluncheon,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cand the mail has come in. There\xe2\x80\x99s a bundle of\r\nletters for you\xe2\x80\x94letters from England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of saying, as he meant her to say, that she wished to see them,\r\nshe said nothing for some time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, there they go, rolling off the edge of the hill,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRolling, Rachel? What do you see rolling? There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing rolling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old woman with the knife,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, not speaking to Terence in\r\nparticular, and looking past him. As she appeared to be looking at a\r\nvase on the shelf opposite, he rose and took it down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow they can\xe2\x80\x99t roll any more,\xe2\x80\x9d he said cheerfully. Nevertheless she\r\nlay gazing at the same spot, and paid him no further attention although\r\nhe spoke to her. He became so profoundly wretched that he could not\r\nendure to sit with her, but wandered about until he found St. John, who\r\nwas reading _The Times_ in the verandah. He laid it aside patiently,\r\nand heard all that Terence had to say about delirium. He was very\r\npatient with Terence. He treated him like a child.\r\n\r\nBy Friday it could not be denied that the illness was no longer an\r\nattack that would pass off in a day or two; it was a real illness that\r\nrequired a good deal of organisation, and engrossed the attention of at\r\nleast five people, but there was no reason to be anxious. Instead of\r\nlasting five days it was going to last ten days. Rodriguez was\r\nunderstood to say that there were well-known varieties of this illness.\r\nRodriguez appeared to think that they were treating the illness with\r\nundue anxiety. His visits were always marked by the same show of\r\nconfidence, and in his interviews with Terence he always waved aside\r\nhis anxious and minute questions with a kind of flourish which seemed\r\nto indicate that they were all taking it much too seriously. He seemed\r\ncuriously unwilling to sit down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA high temperature,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking furtively about the room, and\r\nappearing to be more interested in the furniture and in Helen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nembroidery than in anything else. \xe2\x80\x9cIn this climate you must expect a\r\nhigh temperature. You need not be alarmed by that. It is the pulse we\r\ngo by\xe2\x80\x9d (he tapped his own hairy wrist), \xe2\x80\x9cand the pulse continues\r\nexcellent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereupon he bowed and slipped out. The interview was conducted\r\nlaboriously upon both sides in French, and this, together with the fact\r\nthat he was optimistic, and that Terence respected the medical\r\nprofession from hearsay, made him less critical than he would have been\r\nhad he encountered the doctor in any other capacity. Unconsciously he\r\ntook Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99 side against Helen, who seemed to have taken an\r\nunreasonable prejudice against him.\r\n\r\nWhen Saturday came it was evident that the hours of the day must be\r\nmore strictly organised than they had been. St. John offered his\r\nservices; he said that he had nothing to do, and that he might as well\r\nspend the day at the villa if he could be of use. As if they were\r\nstarting on a difficult expedition together, they parcelled out their\r\nduties between them, writing out an elaborate scheme of hours upon a\r\nlarge sheet of paper which was pinned to the drawing-room door. Their\r\ndistance from the town, and the difficulty of procuring rare things\r\nwith unknown names from the most unexpected places, made it necessary\r\nto think very carefully, and they found it unexpectedly difficult to do\r\nthe simple but practical things that were required of them, as if they,\r\nbeing very tall, were asked to stoop down and arrange minute grains of\r\nsand in a pattern on the ground.\r\n\r\nIt was St. John\xe2\x80\x99s duty to fetch what was needed from the town, so that\r\nTerence would sit all through the long hot hours alone in the\r\ndrawing-room, near the open door, listening for any movement upstairs,\r\nor call from Helen. He always forgot to pull down the blinds, so that\r\nhe sat in bright sunshine, which worried him without his knowing what\r\nwas the cause of it. The room was terribly stiff and uncomfortable.\r\nThere were hats in the chairs, and medicine bottles among the books. He\r\ntried to read, but good books were too good, and bad books were too\r\nbad, and the only thing he could tolerate was the newspaper, which with\r\nits news of London, and the movements of real people who were giving\r\ndinner-parties and making speeches, seemed to give a little background\r\nof reality to what was otherwise mere nightmare. Then, just as his\r\nattention was fixed on the print, a soft call would come from Helen, or\r\nMrs. Chailey would bring in something which was wanted upstairs, and he\r\nwould run up very quietly in his socks, and put the jug on the little\r\ntable which stood crowded with jugs and cups outside the bedroom door;\r\nor if he could catch Helen for a moment he would ask, \xe2\x80\x9cHow is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather restless. . . . On the whole, quieter, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe answer would be one or the other.\r\n\r\nAs usual she seemed to reserve something which she did not say, and\r\nTerence was conscious that they disagreed, and, without saying it\r\naloud, were arguing against each other. But she was too hurried and\r\npre-occupied to talk.\r\n\r\nThe strain of listening and the effort of making practical arrangements\r\nand seeing that things worked smoothly, absorbed all Terence\xe2\x80\x99s power.\r\nInvolved in this long dreary nightmare, he did not attempt to think\r\nwhat it amounted to. Rachel was ill; that was all; he must see that\r\nthere was medicine and milk, and that things were ready when they were\r\nwanted. Thought had ceased; life itself had come to a standstill.\r\nSunday was rather worse than Saturday had been, simply because the\r\nstrain was a little greater every day, although nothing else had\r\nchanged. The separate feelings of pleasure, interest, and pain, which\r\ncombine to make up the ordinary day, were merged in one long-drawn\r\nsensation of sordid misery and profound boredom. He had never been so\r\nbored since he was shut up in the nursery alone as a child. The vision\r\nof Rachel as she was now, confused and heedless, had almost obliterated\r\nthe vision of her as she had been once long ago; he could hardly\r\nbelieve that they had ever been happy, or engaged to be married, for\r\nwhat were feelings, what was there to be felt? Confusion covered every\r\nsight and person, and he seemed to see St. John, Ridley, and the stray\r\npeople who came up now and then from the hotel to enquire, through a\r\nmist; the only people who were not hidden in this mist were Helen and\r\nRodriguez, because they could tell him something definite about Rachel.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the day followed the usual forms. At certain hours they\r\nwent into the dining-room, and when they sat round the table they\r\ntalked about indifferent things. St. John usually made it his business\r\nto start the talk and to keep it from dying out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve discovered the way to get Sancho past the white house,\xe2\x80\x9d said St.\r\nJohn on Sunday at luncheon. \xe2\x80\x9cYou crackle a piece of paper in his ear,\r\nthen he bolts for about a hundred yards, but he goes on quite well\r\nafter that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but he wants corn. You should see that he has corn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think much of the stuff they give him; and Angelo seems a\r\ndirty little rascal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was then a long silence. Ridley murmured a few lines of poetry\r\nunder his breath, and remarked, as if to conceal the fact that he had\r\ndone so, \xe2\x80\x9cVery hot to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo degrees higher than it was yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. John. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder\r\nwhere these nuts come from,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, taking a nut out of the\r\nplate, turning it over in his fingers, and looking at it curiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLondon, I should think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Terence, looking at the nut too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA competent man of business could make a fortune here in no time,\xe2\x80\x9d St.\r\nJohn continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose the heat does something funny to people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrains. Even the English go a little queer. Anyhow they\xe2\x80\x99re hopeless\r\npeople to deal with. They kept me three-quarters of an hour waiting at\r\nthe chemist\xe2\x80\x99s this morning, for no reason whatever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was another long pause. Then Ridley enquired, \xe2\x80\x9cRodriguez seems\r\nsatisfied?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite,\xe2\x80\x9d said Terence with decision. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just got to run its course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nWhereupon Ridley heaved a deep sigh. He was genuinely sorry for every\r\none, but at the same time he missed Helen considerably, and was a\r\nlittle aggrieved by the constant presence of the two young men.\r\n\r\nThey moved back into the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Hirst,\xe2\x80\x9d said Terence, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be done for two\r\nhours.\xe2\x80\x9d He consulted the sheet pinned to the door. \xe2\x80\x9cYou go and lie\r\ndown. I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait here. Chailey sits with Rachel while Helen has her\r\nluncheon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was asking a good deal of Hirst to tell him to go without waiting\r\nfor a sight of Helen. These little glimpses of Helen were the only\r\nrespites from strain and boredom, and very often they seemed to make up\r\nfor the discomfort of the day, although she might not have anything to\r\ntell them. However, as they were on an expedition together, he had made\r\nup his mind to obey.\r\n\r\nHelen was very late in coming down. She looked like a person who has\r\nbeen sitting for a long time in the dark. She was pale and thinner, and\r\nthe expression of her eyes was harassed but determined. She ate her\r\nluncheon quickly, and seemed indifferent to what she was doing. She\r\nbrushed aside Terence\xe2\x80\x99s enquiries, and at last, as if he had not\r\nspoken, she looked at him with a slight frown and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t go on like this, Terence. Either you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to find another\r\ndoctor, or you must tell Rodriguez to stop coming, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll manage for\r\nmyself. It\xe2\x80\x99s no use for him to say that Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s better; she\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nbetter; she\xe2\x80\x99s worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTerence suffered a terrific shock, like that which he had suffered when\r\nRachel said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy head aches.\xe2\x80\x9d He stilled it by reflecting that Helen\r\nwas overwrought, and he was upheld in this opinion by his obstinate\r\nsense that she was opposed to him in the argument.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think she\xe2\x80\x99s in danger?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one can go on being as ill as that day after day\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Helen replied.\r\nShe looked at him, and spoke as if she felt some indignation with\r\nsomebody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to Rodriguez this afternoon,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\r\nHelen went upstairs at once.\r\n\r\nNothing now could assuage Terence\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety. He could not read, nor\r\ncould he sit still, and his sense of security was shaken, in spite of\r\nthe fact that he was determined that Helen was exaggerating, and that\r\nRachel was not very ill. But he wanted a third person to confirm him in\r\nhis belief.\r\n\r\nDirectly Rodriguez came down he demanded, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, how is she? Do you\r\nthink her worse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no reason for anxiety, I tell you\xe2\x80\x94none,\xe2\x80\x9d Rodriguez replied in\r\nhis execrable French, smiling uneasily, and making little movements all\r\nthe time as if to get away.\r\n\r\nHewet stood firmly between him and the door. He was determined to see\r\nfor himself what kind of man he was. His confidence in the man vanished\r\nas he looked at him and saw his insignificance, his dirty appearance,\r\nhis shiftiness, and his unintelligent, hairy face. It was strange that\r\nhe had never seen this before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t object, of course, if we ask you to consult another doctor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe continued.\r\n\r\nAt this the little man became openly incensed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have not confidence in me? You object to my\r\ntreatment? You wish me to give up the case?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Terence replied, \xe2\x80\x9cbut in serious illness of this kind\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRodriguez shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not serious, I assure you. You are overanxious. The young lady\r\nis not seriously ill, and I am a doctor. The lady of course is\r\nfrightened,\xe2\x80\x9d he sneered. \xe2\x80\x9cI understand that perfectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe name and address of the doctor is\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d Terence continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no other doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d Rodriguez replied sullenly. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery one has\r\nconfidence in me. Look! I will show you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took out a packet of old letters and began turning them over as if\r\nin search of one that would confute Terence\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions. As he\r\nsearched, he began to tell a story about an English lord who had\r\ntrusted him\xe2\x80\x94a great English lord, whose name he had, unfortunately,\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no other doctor in the place,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, still turning\r\nover the letters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Terence shortly. \xe2\x80\x9cI will make enquiries for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nRodriguez put the letters back in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no objection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lifted his eyebrows, shrugged his shoulders, as if to repeat that\r\nthey took the illness much too seriously and that there was no other\r\ndoctor, and slipped out, leaving behind him an impression that he was\r\nconscious that he was distrusted, and that his malice was aroused.\r\n\r\nAfter this Terence could no longer stay downstairs. He went up, knocked\r\nat Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s door, and asked Helen whether he might see her for a few\r\nminutes. He had not seen her yesterday. She made no objection, and went\r\nand sat at a table in the window.\r\n\r\nTerence sat down by the bedside. Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s face was changed. She looked\r\nas though she were entirely concentrated upon the effort of keeping\r\nalive. Her lips were drawn, and her cheeks were sunken and flushed,\r\nthough without colour. Her eyes were not entirely shut, the lower half\r\nof the white part showing, not as if she saw, but as if they remained\r\nopen because she was too much exhausted to close them. She opened them\r\ncompletely when he kissed her. But she only saw an old woman slicing a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s head off with a knife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it falls!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. She then turned to Terence and asked\r\nhim anxiously some question about a man with mules, which he could not\r\nunderstand. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he come? Why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he come?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\nHe was appalled to think of the dirty little man downstairs in\r\nconnection with illness like this, and turned instinctively to Helen,\r\nbut she was doing something at a table in the window, and did not seem\r\nto realise how great the shock to him must be. He rose to go, for he\r\ncould not endure to listen any longer; his heart beat quickly and\r\npainfully with anger and misery. As he passed Helen she asked him in\r\nthe same weary, unnatural, but determined voice to fetch her more ice,\r\nand to have the jug outside filled with fresh milk.\r\n\r\nWhen he had done these errands he went to find Hirst. Exhausted and\r\nvery hot, St. John had fallen asleep on a bed, but Terence woke him\r\nwithout scruple.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelen thinks she\xe2\x80\x99s worse,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfrightfully ill. Rodriguez is useless. We must get another doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there is no other doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hirst drowsily, sitting up and\r\nrubbing his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be a damned fool!\xe2\x80\x9d Terence exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course there\xe2\x80\x99s another\r\ndoctor, and, if there isn\xe2\x80\x99t, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to find one. It ought to have\r\nbeen done days ago. I\xe2\x80\x99m going down to saddle the horse.\xe2\x80\x9d He could not\r\nstay still in one place.\r\n\r\nIn less than ten minutes St. John was riding to the town in the\r\nscorching heat in search of a doctor, his orders being to find one and\r\nbring him back if he had to be fetched in a special train.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe ought to have done it days ago,\xe2\x80\x9d Hewet repeated angrily.\r\n\r\nWhen he went back into the drawing-room he found that Mrs. Flushing was\r\nthere, standing very erect in the middle of the room, having arrived,\r\nas people did in these days, by the kitchen or through the garden\r\nunannounced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s better?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Flushing enquired abruptly; they did not attempt\r\nto shake hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Terence. \xe2\x80\x9cIf anything, they think she\xe2\x80\x99s worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Flushing seemed to consider for a moment or two, looking straight\r\nat Terence all the time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, speaking in nervous jerks, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s always\r\nabout the seventh day one begins to get anxious. I daresay you\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nsittin\xe2\x80\x99 here worryin\xe2\x80\x99 by yourself. You think she\xe2\x80\x99s bad, but any one\r\ncomin\xe2\x80\x99 with a fresh eye would see she was better. Mr. Elliot\xe2\x80\x99s had\r\nfever; he\xe2\x80\x99s all right now,\xe2\x80\x9d she threw out. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anythin\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\ncaught on the expedition. What\xe2\x80\x99s it matter\xe2\x80\x94a few days\xe2\x80\x99 fever? My\r\nbrother had fever for twenty-six days once. And in a week or two he was\r\nup and about. We gave him nothin\xe2\x80\x99 but milk and arrowroot\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Mrs. Chailey came in with a message.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m wanted upstairs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Terence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99ll be better,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Flushing jerked out as he left the\r\nroom. Her anxiety to persuade Terence was very great, and when he left\r\nher without saying anything she felt dissatisfied and restless; she did\r\nnot like to stay, but she could not bear to go. She wandered from room\r\nto room looking for some one to talk to, but all the rooms were empty.\r\n\r\nTerence went upstairs, stood inside the door to take Helen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndirections, looked over at Rachel, but did not attempt to speak to her.\r\nShe appeared vaguely conscious of his presence, but it seemed to\r\ndisturb her, and she turned, so that she lay with her back to him.\r\n\r\nFor six days indeed she had been oblivious of the world outside,\r\nbecause it needed all her attention to follow the hot, red, quick\r\nsights which passed incessantly before her eyes. She knew that it was\r\nof enormous importance that she should attend to these sights and grasp\r\ntheir meaning, but she was always being just too late to hear or see\r\nsomething which would explain it all. For this reason, the\r\nfaces,\xe2\x80\x94Helen\xe2\x80\x99s face, the nurse\xe2\x80\x99s, Terence\xe2\x80\x99s, the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x94which\r\noccasionally forced themselves very close to her, were worrying because\r\nthey distracted her attention and she might miss the clue. However, on\r\nthe fourth afternoon she was suddenly unable to keep Helen\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\ndistinct from the sights themselves; her lips widened as she bent down\r\nover the bed, and she began to gabble unintelligibly like the rest. The\r\nsights were all concerned in some plot, some adventure, some escape.\r\nThe nature of what they were doing changed incessantly, although there\r\nwas always a reason behind it, which she must endeavour to grasp. Now\r\nthey were among trees and savages, now they were on the sea, now they\r\nwere on the tops of high towers; now they jumped; now they flew. But\r\njust as the crisis was about to happen, something invariably slipped in\r\nher brain, so that the whole effort had to begin over again. The heat\r\nwas suffocating. At last the faces went further away; she fell into a\r\ndeep pool of sticky water, which eventually closed over her head. She\r\nsaw nothing and heard nothing but a faint booming sound, which was the\r\nsound of the sea rolling over her head. While all her tormentors\r\nthought that she was dead, she was not dead, but curled up at the\r\nbottom of the sea. There she lay, sometimes seeing darkness, sometimes\r\nlight, while every now and then some one turned her over at the bottom\r\nof the sea.\r\n\r\nAfter St. John had spent some hours in the heat of the sun wrangling\r\nwith evasive and very garrulous natives, he extracted the information\r\nthat there was a doctor, a French doctor, who was at present away on a\r\nholiday in the hills. It was quite impossible, so they said, to find\r\nhim. With his experience of the country, St. John thought it unlikely\r\nthat a telegram would either be sent or received; but having reduced\r\nthe distance of the hill town, in which he was staying, from a hundred\r\nmiles to thirty miles, and having hired a carriage and horses, he\r\nstarted at once to fetch the doctor himself. He succeeded in finding\r\nhim, and eventually forced the unwilling man to leave his young wife\r\nand return forthwith. They reached the villa at midday on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nTerence came out to receive them, and St. John was struck by the fact\r\nthat he had grown perceptibly thinner in the interval; he was white\r\ntoo; his eyes looked strange. But the curt speech and the sulky\r\nmasterful manner of Dr. Lesage impressed them both favourably, although\r\nat the same time it was obvious that he was very much annoyed at the\r\nwhole affair. Coming downstairs he gave his directions emphatically,\r\nbut it never occurred to him to give an opinion either because of the\r\npresence of Rodriguez who was now obsequious as well as malicious, or\r\nbecause he took it for granted that they knew already what was to be\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a shrug of his shoulders, when Terence asked\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cIs she very ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were both conscious of a certain sense of relief when Dr. Lesage\r\nwas gone, leaving explicit directions, and promising another visit in a\r\nfew hours\xe2\x80\x99 time; but, unfortunately, the rise of their spirits led them\r\nto talk more than usual, and in talking they quarrelled. They\r\nquarrelled about a road, the Portsmouth Road. St. John said that it is\r\nmacadamised where it passes Hindhead, and Terence knew as well as he\r\nknew his own name that it is not macadamised at that point. In the\r\ncourse of the argument they said some very sharp things to each other,\r\nand the rest of the dinner was eaten in silence, save for an occasional\r\nhalf-stifled reflection from Ridley.\r\n\r\nWhen it grew dark and the lamps were brought in, Terence felt unable to\r\ncontrol his irritation any longer. St. John went to bed in a state of\r\ncomplete exhaustion, bidding Terence good-night with rather more\r\naffection than usual because of their quarrel, and Ridley retired to\r\nhis books. Left alone, Terence walked up and down the room; he stood at\r\nthe open window.\r\n\r\nThe lights were coming out one after another in the town beneath, and\r\nit was very peaceful and cool in the garden, so that he stepped out on\r\nto the terrace. As he stood there in the darkness, able only to see the\r\nshapes of trees through the fine grey light, he was overcome by a\r\ndesire to escape, to have done with this suffering, to forget that\r\nRachel was ill. He allowed himself to lapse into forgetfulness of\r\neverything. As if a wind that had been raging incessantly suddenly fell\r\nasleep, the fret and strain and anxiety which had been pressing on him\r\npassed away. He seemed to stand in an unvexed space of air, on a little\r\nisland by himself; he was free and immune from pain. It did not matter\r\nwhether Rachel was well or ill; it did not matter whether they were\r\napart or together; nothing mattered\xe2\x80\x94nothing mattered. The waves beat on\r\nthe shore far away, and the soft wind passed through the branches of\r\nthe trees, seeming to encircle him with peace and security, with dark\r\nand nothingness. Surely the world of strife and fret and anxiety was\r\nnot the real world, but this was the real world, the world that lay\r\nbeneath the superficial world, so that, whatever happened, one was\r\nsecure. The quiet and peace seemed to lap his body in a fine cool\r\nsheet, soothing every nerve; his mind seemed once more to expand, and\r\nbecome natural.\r\n\r\nBut when he had stood thus for a time a noise in the house roused him;\r\nhe turned instinctively and went into the drawing-room. The sight of\r\nthe lamp-lit room brought back so abruptly all that he had forgotten\r\nthat he stood for a moment unable to move. He remembered everything,\r\nthe hour, the minute even, what point they had reached, and what was to\r\ncome. He cursed himself for making believe for a minute that things\r\nwere different from what they are. The night was now harder to face\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\nUnable to stay in the empty drawing-room, he wandered out and sat on\r\nthe stairs half-way up to Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s room. He longed for some one to talk\r\nto, but Hirst was asleep, and Ridley was asleep; there was no sound in\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s room. The only sound in the house was the sound of Chailey\r\nmoving in the kitchen. At last there was a rustling on the stairs\r\noverhead, and Nurse McInnis came down fastening the links in her cuffs,\r\nin preparation for the night\xe2\x80\x99s watch. Terence rose and stopped her. He\r\nhad scarcely spoken to her, but it was possible that she might confirm\r\nhim in the belief which still persisted in his own mind that Rachel was\r\nnot seriously ill. He told her in a whisper that Dr. Lesage had been\r\nand what he had said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Nurse,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cplease tell me your opinion. Do you\r\nconsider that she is very seriously ill? Is she in any danger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor has said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I want your opinion. You have had experience of many cases\r\nlike this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could not tell you more than Dr. Lesage, Mr. Hewet,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied\r\ncautiously, as though her words might be used against her. \xe2\x80\x9cThe case is\r\nserious, but you may feel quite certain that we are doing all we can\r\nfor Miss Vinrace.\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke with some professional self-approbation.\r\nBut she realised perhaps that she did not satisfy the young man, who\r\nstill blocked her way, for she shifted her feet slightly upon the stair\r\nand looked out of the window where they could see the moon over the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you ask me,\xe2\x80\x9d she began in a curiously stealthy tone, \xe2\x80\x9cI never like\r\nMay for my patients.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay?\xe2\x80\x9d Terence repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be a fancy, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to see anybody fall ill in May,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe continued. \xe2\x80\x9cThings seem to go wrong in May. Perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s the moon.\r\nThey say the moon affects the brain, don\xe2\x80\x99t they, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her but he could not answer her; like all the others, when\r\none looked at her she seemed to shrivel beneath one\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and become\r\nworthless, malicious, and untrustworthy.\r\n\r\nShe slipped past him and disappeared.\r\n\r\nThough he went to his room he was unable even to take his clothes off.\r\nFor a long time he paced up and down, and then leaning out of the\r\nwindow gazed at the earth which lay so dark against the paler blue of\r\nthe sky. With a mixture of fear and loathing he looked at the slim\r\nblack cypress trees which were still visible in the garden, and heard\r\nthe unfamiliar creaking and grating sounds which show that the earth is\r\nstill hot. All these sights and sounds appeared sinister and full of\r\nhostility and foreboding; together with the natives and the nurse and\r\nthe doctor and the terrible force of the illness itself they seemed to\r\nbe in conspiracy against him. They seemed to join together in their\r\neffort to extract the greatest possible amount of suffering from him.\r\nHe could not get used to his pain, it was a revelation to him. He had\r\nnever realised before that underneath every action, underneath the life\r\nof every day, pain lies, quiescent, but ready to devour; he seemed to\r\nbe able to see suffering, as if it were a fire, curling up over the\r\nedges of all action, eating away the lives of men and women. He thought\r\nfor the first time with understanding of words which had before seemed\r\nto him empty: the struggle of life; the hardness of life. Now he knew\r\nfor himself that life is hard and full of suffering. He looked at the\r\nscattered lights in the town beneath, and thought of Arthur and Susan,\r\nor Evelyn and Perrott venturing out unwittingly, and by their happiness\r\nlaying themselves open to suffering such as this. How did they dare to\r\nlove each other, he wondered; how had he himself dared to live as he\r\nhad lived, rapidly and carelessly, passing from one thing to another,\r\nloving Rachel as he had loved her? Never again would he feel secure; he\r\nwould never believe in the stability of life, or forget what depths of\r\npain lie beneath small happiness and feelings of content and safety. It\r\nseemed to him as he looked back that their happiness had never been so\r\ngreat as his pain was now. There had always been something imperfect in\r\ntheir happiness, something they had wanted and had not been able to\r\nget. It had been fragmentary and incomplete, because they were so young\r\nand had not known what they were doing.\r\n\r\nThe light of his candle flickered over the boughs of a tree outside the\r\nwindow, and as the branch swayed in the darkness there came before his\r\nmind a picture of all the world that lay outside his window; he thought\r\nof the immense river and the immense forest, the vast stretches of dry\r\nearth and the plains of the sea that encircled the earth; from the sea\r\nthe sky rose steep and enormous, and the air washed profoundly between\r\nthe sky and the sea. How vast and dark it must be tonight, lying\r\nexposed to the wind; and in all this great space it was curious to\r\nthink how few the towns were, and how small little rings of light, or\r\nsingle glow-worms he figured them, scattered here and there, among the\r\nswelling uncultivated folds of the world. And in those towns were\r\nlittle men and women, tiny men and women. Oh, it was absurd, when one\r\nthought of it, to sit here in a little room suffering and caring. What\r\ndid anything matter? Rachel, a tiny creature, lay ill beneath him, and\r\nhere in his little room he suffered on her account. The nearness of\r\ntheir bodies in this vast universe, and the minuteness of their bodies,\r\nseemed to him absurd and laughable. Nothing mattered, he repeated; they\r\nhad no power, no hope. He leant on the window-sill, thinking, until he\r\nalmost forgot the time and the place. Nevertheless, although he was\r\nconvinced that it was absurd and laughable, and that they were small\r\nand hopeless, he never lost the sense that these thoughts somehow\r\nformed part of a life which he and Rachel would live together.\r\n\r\nOwing perhaps to the change of doctor, Rachel appeared to be rather\r\nbetter next day. Terribly pale and worn though Helen looked, there was\r\na slight lifting of the cloud which had hung all these days in her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe talked to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said voluntarily. \xe2\x80\x9cShe asked me what day of the\r\nweek it was, like herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen suddenly, without any warning or any apparent reason, the tears\r\nformed in her eyes and rolled steadily down her cheeks. She cried with\r\nscarcely any attempt at movement of her features, and without any\r\nattempt to stop herself, as if she did not know that she was crying. In\r\nspite of the relief which her words gave him, Terence was dismayed by\r\nthe sight; had everything given way? Were there no limits to the power\r\nof this illness? Would everything go down before it? Helen had always\r\nseemed to him strong and determined, and now she was like a child. He\r\ntook her in his arms, and she clung to him like a child, crying softly\r\nand quietly upon his shoulder. Then she roused herself and wiped her\r\ntears away; it was silly to behave like that, she said; very silly, she\r\nrepeated, when there could be no doubt that Rachel was better. She\r\nasked Terence to forgive her for her folly. She stopped at the door and\r\ncame back and kissed him without saying anything.\r\n\r\nOn this day indeed Rachel was conscious of what went on round her. She\r\nhad come to the surface of the dark, sticky pool, and a wave seemed to\r\nbear her up and down with it; she had ceased to have any will of her\r\nown; she lay on the top of the wave conscious of some pain, but chiefly\r\nof weakness. The wave was replaced by the side of a mountain. Her body\r\nbecame a drift of melting snow, above which her knees rose in huge\r\npeaked mountains of bare bone. It was true that she saw Helen and saw\r\nher room, but everything had become very pale and semi-transparent.\r\nSometimes she could see through the wall in front of her. Sometimes\r\nwhen Helen went away she seemed to go so far that Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s eyes could\r\nhardly follow her. The room also had an odd power of expanding, and\r\nthough she pushed her voice out as far as possible until sometimes it\r\nbecame a bird and flew away, she thought it doubtful whether it ever\r\nreached the person she was talking to. There were immense intervals or\r\nchasms, for things still had the power to appear visibly before her,\r\nbetween one moment and the next; it sometimes took an hour for Helen to\r\nraise her arm, pausing long between each jerky movement, and pour out\r\nmedicine. Helen\xe2\x80\x99s form stooping to raise her in bed appeared of\r\ngigantic size, and came down upon her like the ceiling falling. But for\r\nlong spaces of time she would merely lie conscious of her body floating\r\non the top of the bed and her mind driven to some remote corner of her\r\nbody, or escaped and gone flitting round the room. All sights were\r\nsomething of an effort, but the sight of Terence was the greatest\r\neffort, because he forced her to join mind to body in the desire to\r\nremember something. She did not wish to remember; it troubled her when\r\npeople tried to disturb her loneliness; she wished to be alone. She\r\nwished for nothing else in the world.\r\n\r\nAlthough she had cried, Terence observed Helen\xe2\x80\x99s greater hopefulness\r\nwith something like triumph; in the argument between them she had made\r\nthe first sign of admitting herself in the wrong. He waited for Dr.\r\nLesage to come down that afternoon with considerable anxiety, but with\r\nthe same certainty at the back of his mind that he would in time force\r\nthem all to admit that they were in the wrong.\r\n\r\nAs usual, Dr. Lesage was sulky in his manner and very short in his\r\nanswers. To Terence\xe2\x80\x99s demand, \xe2\x80\x9cShe seems to be better?\xe2\x80\x9d he replied,\r\nlooking at him in an odd way, \xe2\x80\x9cShe has a chance of life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door shut and Terence walked across to the window. He leant his\r\nforehead against the pane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRachel,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has a chance of life. Rachel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow could they say these things of Rachel? Had any one yesterday\r\nseriously believed that Rachel was dying? They had been engaged for\r\nfour weeks. A fortnight ago she had been perfectly well. What could\r\nfourteen days have done to bring her from that state to this? To\r\nrealise what they meant by saying that she had a chance of life was\r\nbeyond him, knowing as he did that they were engaged. He turned, still\r\nenveloped in the same dreary mist, and walked towards the door.\r\nSuddenly he saw it all. He saw the room and the garden, and the trees\r\nmoving in the air, they could go on without her; she could die. For the\r\nfirst time since she fell ill he remembered exactly what she looked\r\nlike and the way in which they cared for each other. The immense\r\nhappiness of feeling her close to him mingled with a more intense\r\nanxiety than he had felt yet. He could not let her die; he could not\r\nlive without her. But after a momentary struggle, the curtain fell\r\nagain, and he saw nothing and felt nothing clearly. It was all going\r\non\xe2\x80\x94going on still, in the same way as before. Save for a physical pain\r\nwhen his heart beat, and the fact that his fingers were icy cold, he\r\ndid not realise that he was anxious about anything. Within his mind he\r\nseemed to feel nothing about Rachel or about any one or anything in the\r\nworld. He went on giving orders, arranging with Mrs. Chailey, writing\r\nout lists, and every now and then he went upstairs and put something\r\nquietly on the table outside Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s door. That night Dr. Lesage\r\nseemed to be less sulky than usual. He stayed voluntarily for a few\r\nmoments, and, addressing St. John and Terence equally, as if he did not\r\nremember which of them was engaged to the young lady, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI consider\r\nthat her condition to-night is very grave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNeither of them went to bed or suggested that the other should go to\r\nbed. They sat in the drawing-room playing picquet with the door open.\r\nSt. John made up a bed upon the sofa, and when it was ready insisted\r\nthat Terence should lie upon it. They began to quarrel as to who should\r\nlie on the sofa and who should lie upon a couple of chairs covered with\r\nrugs. St. John forced Terence at last to lie down upon the sofa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be a fool, Terence,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll only get ill if you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, as Terence still refused, and stopped abruptly,\r\nfearing sentimentality; he found that he was on the verge of tears.\r\n\r\nHe began to say what he had long been wanting to say, that he was sorry\r\nfor Terence, that he cared for him, that he cared for Rachel. Did she\r\nknow how much he cared for her\xe2\x80\x94had she said anything, asked perhaps? He\r\nwas very anxious to say this, but he refrained, thinking that it was a\r\nselfish question after all, and what was the use of bothering Terence\r\nto talk about such things? He was already half asleep. But St. John\r\ncould not sleep at once. If only, he thought to himself, as he lay in\r\nthe darkness, something would happen\xe2\x80\x94if only this strain would come to\r\nan end. He did not mind what happened, so long as the succession of\r\nthese hard and dreary days was broken; he did not mind if she died. He\r\nfelt himself disloyal in not minding it, but it seemed to him that he\r\nhad no feelings left.\r\n\r\nAll night long there was no call or movement, except the opening and\r\nshutting of the bedroom door once. By degrees the light returned into\r\nthe untidy room. At six the servants began to move; at seven they crept\r\ndownstairs into the kitchen; and half an hour later the day began\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it was not the same as the days that had gone before,\r\nalthough it would have been hard to say in what the difference\r\nconsisted. Perhaps it was that they seemed to be waiting for something.\r\nThere were certainly fewer things to be done than usual. People drifted\r\nthrough the drawing-room\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Flushing, Mr. and Mrs. Thornbury. They\r\nspoke very apologetically in low tones, refusing to sit down, but\r\nremaining for a considerable time standing up, although the only thing\r\nthey had to say was, \xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything we can do?\xe2\x80\x9d and there was\r\nnothing they could do.\r\n\r\nFeeling oddly detached from it all, Terence remembered how Helen had\r\nsaid that whenever anything happened to you this was how people\r\nbehaved. Was she right, or was she wrong? He was too little interested\r\nto frame an opinion of his own. He put things away in his mind, as if\r\none of these days he would think about them, but not now. The mist of\r\nunreality had deepened and deepened until it had produced a feeling of\r\nnumbness all over his body. Was it his body? Were those really his own\r\nhands?\r\n\r\nThis morning also for the first time Ridley found it impossible to sit\r\nalone in his room. He was very uncomfortable downstairs, and, as he did\r\nnot know what was going on, constantly in the way; but he would not\r\nleave the drawing-room. Too restless to read, and having nothing to do,\r\nhe began to pace up and down reciting poetry in an undertone. Occupied\r\nin various ways\xe2\x80\x94now in undoing parcels, now in uncorking bottles, now\r\nin writing directions, the sound of Ridley\xe2\x80\x99s song and the beat of his\r\npacing worked into the minds of Terence and St. John all the morning as\r\na half comprehended refrain.\r\n\r\nThey wrestled up, they wrestled down,\r\n    They wrestled sore and still:\r\nThe fiend who blinds the eyes of men,\r\n    That night he had his will.\r\n\r\nLike stags full spent, among the bent\r\n    They dropped awhile to rest\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s intolerable!\xe2\x80\x9d Hirst exclaimed, and then checked himself, as\r\nif it were a breach of their agreement. Again and again Terence would\r\ncreep half-way up the stairs in case he might be able to glean news of\r\nRachel. But the only news now was of a very fragmentary kind; she had\r\ndrunk something; she had slept a little; she seemed quieter. In the\r\nsame way, Dr. Lesage confined himself to talking about details, save\r\nonce when he volunteered the information that he had just been called\r\nin to ascertain, by severing a vein in the wrist, that an old lady of\r\neighty-five was really dead. She had a horror of being buried alive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a horror,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we generally find in the very old,\r\nand seldom in the young.\xe2\x80\x9d They both expressed their interest in what he\r\ntold them; it seemed to them very strange. Another strange thing about\r\nthe day was that the luncheon was forgotten by all of them until it was\r\nlate in the afternoon, and then Mrs. Chailey waited on them, and looked\r\nstrange too, because she wore a stiff print dress, and her sleeves were\r\nrolled up above her elbows. She seemed as oblivious of her appearance,\r\nhowever, as if she had been called out of her bed by a midnight alarm\r\nof fire, and she had forgotten, too, her reserve and her composure; she\r\ntalked to them quite familiarly as if she had nursed them and held them\r\nnaked on her knee. She assured them over and over again that it was\r\ntheir duty to eat.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon, being thus shortened, passed more quickly than they\r\nexpected. Once Mrs. Flushing opened the door, but on seeing them shut\r\nit again quickly; once Helen came down to fetch something, but she\r\nstopped as she left the room to look at a letter addressed to her. She\r\nstood for a moment turning it over, and the extraordinary and mournful\r\nbeauty of her attitude struck Terence in the way things struck him\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94as something to be put away in his mind and to be thought about\r\nafterwards. They scarcely spoke, the argument between them seeming to\r\nbe suspended or forgotten.\r\n\r\nNow that the afternoon sun had left the front of the house, Ridley\r\npaced up and down the terrace repeating stanzas of a long poem, in a\r\nsubdued but suddenly sonorous voice. Fragments of the poem were wafted\r\nin at the open window as he passed and repassed.\r\n\r\nPeor and Baalim\r\nForsake their Temples dim,\r\n    With that twice batter\xe2\x80\x99d God of Palestine\r\nAnd mooned Astaroth\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sound of these words were strangely discomforting to both the young\r\nmen, but they had to be borne. As the evening drew on and the red light\r\nof the sunset glittered far away on the sea, the same sense of\r\ndesperation attacked both Terence and St. John at the thought that the\r\nday was nearly over, and that another night was at hand. The appearance\r\nof one light after another in the town beneath them produced in Hirst a\r\nrepetition of his terrible and disgusting desire to break down and sob.\r\nThen the lamps were brought in by Chailey. She explained that Maria, in\r\nopening a bottle, had been so foolish as to cut her arm badly, but she\r\nhad bound it up; it was unfortunate when there was so much work to be\r\ndone. Chailey herself limped because of the rheumatism in her feet, but\r\nit appeared to her mere waste of time to take any notice of the unruly\r\nflesh of servants. The evening went on. Dr. Lesage arrived\r\nunexpectedly, and stayed upstairs a very long time. He came down once\r\nand drank a cup of coffee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is very ill,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in answer to Ridley\xe2\x80\x99s question. All the\r\nannoyance had by this time left his manner, he was grave and formal,\r\nbut at the same time it was full of consideration, which had not marked\r\nit before. He went upstairs again. The three men sat together in the\r\ndrawing-room. Ridley was quite quiet now, and his attention seemed to\r\nbe thoroughly awakened. Save for little half-voluntary movements and\r\nexclamations that were stifled at once, they waited in complete\r\nsilence. It seemed as if they were at last brought together face to\r\nface with something definite.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock when Dr. Lesage again appeared in the\r\nroom. He approached them very slowly, and did not speak at once. He\r\nlooked first at St. John and then at Terence, and said to Terence, \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nHewet, I think you should go upstairs now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTerence rose immediately, leaving the others seated with Dr. Lesage\r\nstanding motionless between them.\r\n\r\nChailey was in the passage outside, repeating over and over again,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s wicked\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s wicked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTerence paid her no attention; he heard what she was saying, but it\r\nconveyed no meaning to his mind. All the way upstairs he kept saying to\r\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x9cThis has not happened to me. It is not possible that this has\r\nhappened to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked curiously at his own hand on the banisters. The stairs were\r\nvery steep, and it seemed to take him a long time to surmount them.\r\nInstead of feeling keenly, as he knew that he ought to feel, he felt\r\nnothing at all. When he opened the door he saw Helen sitting by the\r\nbedside. There were shaded lights on the table, and the room, though it\r\nseemed to be full of a great many things, was very tidy. There was a\r\nfaint and not unpleasant smell of disinfectants. Helen rose and gave up\r\nher chair to him in silence. As they passed each other their eyes met\r\nin a peculiar level glance, he wondered at the extraordinary clearness\r\nof his eyes, and at the deep calm and sadness that dwelt in them. He\r\nsat down by the bedside, and a moment afterwards heard the door shut\r\ngently behind her. He was alone with Rachel, and a faint reflection of\r\nthe sense of relief that they used to feel when they were left alone\r\npossessed him. He looked at her. He expected to find some terrible\r\nchange in her, but there was none. She looked indeed very thin, and, as\r\nfar as he could see, very tired, but she was the same as she had always\r\nbeen. Moreover, she saw him and knew him. She smiled at him and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, Terence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe curtain which had been drawn between them for so long vanished\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied in his usual voice, upon which she opened\r\nher eyes quite widely and smiled with her familiar smile. He kissed her\r\nand took her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been wretched without you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe still looked at him and smiled, but soon a slight look of fatigue\r\nor perplexity came into her eyes and she shut them again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when we\xe2\x80\x99re together we\xe2\x80\x99re perfectly happy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He continued\r\nto hold her hand.\r\n\r\nThe light being dim, it was impossible to see any change in her face.\r\nAn immense feeling of peace came over Terence, so that he had no wish\r\nto move or to speak. The terrible torture and unreality of the last\r\ndays were over, and he had come out now into perfect certainty and\r\npeace. His mind began to work naturally again and with great ease. The\r\nlonger he sat there the more profoundly was he conscious of the peace\r\ninvading every corner of his soul. Once he held his breath and listened\r\nacutely; she was still breathing; he went on thinking for some time;\r\nthey seemed to be thinking together; he seemed to be Rachel as well as\r\nhimself; and then he listened again; no, she had ceased to breathe. So\r\nmuch the better\xe2\x80\x94this was death. It was nothing; it was to cease to\r\nbreathe. It was happiness, it was perfect happiness. They had now what\r\nthey had always wanted to have, the union which had been impossible\r\nwhile they lived. Unconscious whether he thought the words or spoke\r\nthem aloud, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo two people have ever been so happy as we have\r\nbeen. No one has ever loved as we have loved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him that their complete union and happiness filled the\r\nroom with rings eddying more and more widely. He had no wish in the\r\nworld left unfulfilled. They possessed what could never be taken from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHe was not conscious that any one had come into the room, but later,\r\nmoments later, or hours later perhaps, he felt an arm behind him. The\r\narms were round him. He did not want to have arms round him, and the\r\nmysterious whispering voices annoyed him. He laid Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s hand, which\r\nwas now cold, upon the counterpane, and rose from his chair, and walked\r\nacross to the window. The windows were uncurtained, and showed the\r\nmoon, and a long silver pathway upon the surface of the waves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in his ordinary tone of voice, \xe2\x80\x9clook at the moon.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a halo round the moon. We shall have rain to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe arms, whether they were the arms of man or of woman, were round him\r\nagain; they were pushing him gently towards the door. He turned of his\r\nown accord and walked steadily in advance of the arms, conscious of a\r\nlittle amusement at the strange way in which people behaved merely\r\nbecause some one was dead. He would go if they wished it, but nothing\r\nthey could do would disturb his happiness.\r\n\r\nAs he saw the passage outside the room, and the table with the cups and\r\nthe plates, it suddenly came over him that here was a world in which he\r\nwould never see Rachel again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRachel! Rachel!\xe2\x80\x9d he shrieked, trying to rush back to her. But they\r\nprevented him, and pushed him down the passage and into a bedroom far\r\nfrom her room. Downstairs they could hear the thud of his feet on the\r\nfloor, as he struggled to break free; and twice they heard him shout,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRachel, Rachel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nFor two or three hours longer the moon poured its light through the\r\nempty air. Unbroken by clouds it fell straightly, and lay almost like a\r\nchill white frost over the sea and the earth. During these hours the\r\nsilence was not broken, and the only movement was caused by the\r\nmovement of trees and branches which stirred slightly, and then the\r\nshadows that lay across the white spaces of the land moved too. In this\r\nprofound silence one sound only was audible, the sound of a slight but\r\ncontinuous breathing which never ceased, although it never rose and\r\nnever fell. It continued after the birds had begun to flutter from\r\nbranch to branch, and could be heard behind the first thin notes of\r\ntheir voices. It continued all through the hours when the east\r\nwhitened, and grew red, and a faint blue tinged the sky, but when the\r\nsun rose it ceased, and gave place to other sounds.\r\n\r\nThe first sounds that were heard were little inarticulate cries, the\r\ncries, it seemed, of children or of the very poor, of people who were\r\nvery weak or in pain. But when the sun was above the horizon, the air\r\nwhich had been thin and pale grew every moment richer and warmer, and\r\nthe sounds of life became bolder and more full of courage and\r\nauthority. By degrees the smoke began to ascend in wavering breaths\r\nover the houses, and these slowly thickened, until they were as round\r\nand straight as columns, and instead of striking upon pale white\r\nblinds, the sun shone upon dark windows, beyond which there was depth\r\nand space.\r\n\r\nThe sun had been up for many hours, and the great dome of air was\r\nwarmed through and glittering with thin gold threads of sunlight,\r\nbefore any one moved in the hotel. White and massive it stood in the\r\nearly light, half asleep with its blinds down.\r\n\r\nAt about half-past nine Miss Allan came very slowly into the hall, and\r\nwalked very slowly to the table where the morning papers were laid, but\r\nshe did not put out her hand to take one; she stood still, thinking,\r\nwith her head a little sunk upon her shoulders. She looked curiously\r\nold, and from the way in which she stood, a little hunched together and\r\nvery massive, you could see what she would be like when she was really\r\nold, how she would sit day after day in her chair looking placidly in\r\nfront of her. Other people began to come into the room, and to pass\r\nher, but she did not speak to any of them or even look at them, and at\r\nlast, as if it were necessary to do something, she sat down in a chair,\r\nand looked quietly and fixedly in front of her. She felt very old this\r\nmorning, and useless too, as if her life had been a failure, as if it\r\nhad been hard and laborious to no purpose. She did not want to go on\r\nliving, and yet she knew that she would. She was so strong that she\r\nwould live to be a very old woman. She would probably live to be\r\neighty, and as she was now fifty, that left thirty years more for her\r\nto live. She turned her hands over and over in her lap and looked at\r\nthem curiously; her old hands, that had done so much work for her.\r\nThere did not seem to be much point in it all; one went on, of course\r\none went on. . . . She looked up to see Mrs. Thornbury standing beside\r\nher, with lines drawn upon her forehead, and her lips parted as if she\r\nwere about to ask a question.\r\n\r\nMiss Allan anticipated her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe died this morning, very early, about three\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Thornbury made a little exclamation, drew her lips together, and\r\nthe tears rose in her eyes. Through them she looked at the hall which\r\nwas now laid with great breadths of sunlight, and at the careless,\r\ncasual groups of people who were standing beside the solid arm-chairs\r\nand tables. They looked to her unreal, or as people look who remain\r\nunconscious that some great explosion is about to take place beside\r\nthem. But there was no explosion, and they went on standing by the\r\nchairs and the tables. Mrs. Thornbury no longer saw them, but,\r\npenetrating through them as though they were without substance, she saw\r\nthe house, the people in the house, the room, the bed in the room, and\r\nthe figure of the dead lying still in the dark beneath the sheets. She\r\ncould almost see the dead. She could almost hear the voices of the\r\nmourners.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey expected it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked at length.\r\n\r\nMiss Allan could only shake her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept what Mrs. Flushing\xe2\x80\x99s maid told\r\nme. She died early this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two women looked at each other with a quiet significant gaze, and\r\nthen, feeling oddly dazed, and seeking she did not know exactly what,\r\nMrs. Thornbury went slowly upstairs and walked quietly along the\r\npassages, touching the wall with her fingers as if to guide herself.\r\nHousemaids were passing briskly from room to room, but Mrs. Thornbury\r\navoided them; she hardly saw them; they seemed to her to be in another\r\nworld. She did not even look up directly when Evelyn stopped her. It\r\nwas evident that Evelyn had been lately in tears, and when she looked\r\nat Mrs. Thornbury she began to cry again. Together they drew into the\r\nhollow of a window, and stood there in silence. Broken words formed\r\nthemselves at last among Evelyn\xe2\x80\x99s sobs. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was wicked,\xe2\x80\x9d she sobbed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit was cruel\xe2\x80\x94they were so happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Thornbury patted her on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems hard\xe2\x80\x94very hard,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. She paused and looked out over the\r\nslope of the hill at the Ambroses\xe2\x80\x99 villa; the windows were blazing in\r\nthe sun, and she thought how the soul of the dead had passed from those\r\nwindows. Something had passed from the world. It seemed to her\r\nstrangely empty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet the older one grows,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, her eyes regaining more\r\nthan their usual brightness, \xe2\x80\x9cthe more certain one becomes that there\r\nis a reason. How could one go on if there were no reason?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nShe asked the question of some one, but she did not ask it of Evelyn.\r\nEvelyn\xe2\x80\x99s sobs were becoming quieter. \xe2\x80\x9cThere must be a reason,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t only be an accident. For it was an accident\xe2\x80\x94it need\r\nnever have happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Thornbury sighed deeply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we must not let ourselves think of that,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cand let us\r\nhope that they don\xe2\x80\x99t either. Whatever they had done it might have been\r\nthe same. These terrible illnesses\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no reason\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe there\xe2\x80\x99s any reason at all!\xe2\x80\x9d Evelyn\r\nbroke out, pulling the blind down and letting it fly back with a little\r\nsnap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should these things happen? Why should people suffer? I honestly\r\nbelieve,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, lowering her voice slightly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nHeaven, but Terence. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of it all?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded.\r\n\r\nMrs. Thornbury shook her head slightly but made no reply, and pressing\r\nEvelyn\xe2\x80\x99s hand she went on down the passage. Impelled by a strong desire\r\nto hear something, although she did not know exactly what there was to\r\nhear, she was making her way to the Flushings\xe2\x80\x99 room. As she opened\r\ntheir door she felt that she had interrupted some argument between\r\nhusband and wife. Mrs. Flushing was sitting with her back to the light,\r\nand Mr. Flushing was standing near her, arguing and trying to persuade\r\nher of something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, here is Mrs. Thornbury,\xe2\x80\x9d he began with some relief in his voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have heard, of course. My wife feels that she was in some way\r\nresponsible. She urged poor Miss Vinrace to come on the expedition. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure you will agree with me that it is most unreasonable to feel that.\r\nWe don\xe2\x80\x99t even know\xe2\x80\x94in fact I think it most unlikely\xe2\x80\x94that she caught her\r\nillness there. These diseases\xe2\x80\x94Besides, she was set on going. She would\r\nhave gone whether you asked her or not, Alice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, Wilfrid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Flushing, neither moving nor taking her\r\neyes off the spot on the floor upon which they rested. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use\r\nof talking? What\xe2\x80\x99s the use\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d She ceased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was coming to ask you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Thornbury, addressing Wilfrid, for\r\nit was useless to speak to his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything you think that\r\none could do? Has the father arrived? Could one go and see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe strongest wish in her being at this moment was to be able to do\r\nsomething for the unhappy people\xe2\x80\x94to see them\xe2\x80\x94to assure them\xe2\x80\x94to help\r\nthem. It was dreadful to be so far away from them. But Mr. Flushing\r\nshook his head; he did not think that now\xe2\x80\x94later perhaps one might be\r\nable to help. Here Mrs. Flushing rose stiffly, turned her back to them,\r\nand walked to the dressing-room opposite. As she walked, they could see\r\nher breast slowly rise and slowly fall. But her grief was silent. She\r\nshut the door behind her.\r\n\r\nWhen she was alone by herself she clenched her fists together, and\r\nbegan beating the back of a chair with them. She was like a wounded\r\nanimal. She hated death; she was furious, outraged, indignant with\r\ndeath, as if it were a living creature. She refused to relinquish her\r\nfriends to death. She would not submit to dark and nothingness. She\r\nbegan to pace up and down, clenching her hands, and making no attempt\r\nto stop the quick tears which raced down her cheeks. She sat still at\r\nlast, but she did not submit. She looked stubborn and strong when she\r\nhad ceased to cry.\r\n\r\nIn the next room, meanwhile, Wilfrid was talking to Mrs. Thornbury with\r\ngreater freedom now that his wife was not sitting there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the worst of these places,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople will behave as\r\nthough they were in England, and they\xe2\x80\x99re not. I\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt myself that\r\nMiss Vinrace caught the infection up at the villa itself. She probably\r\nran risks a dozen times a day that might have given her the illness.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s absurd to say she caught it with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf he had not been sincerely sorry for them he would have been annoyed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPepper tells me,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he left the house because he\r\nthought them so careless. He says they never washed their vegetables\r\nproperly. Poor people! It\xe2\x80\x99s a fearful price to pay. But it\xe2\x80\x99s only what\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over and over again\xe2\x80\x94people seem to forget that these things\r\nhappen, and then they do happen, and they\xe2\x80\x99re surprised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Thornbury agreed with him that they had been very careless, and\r\nthat there was no reason whatever to think that she had caught the\r\nfever on the expedition; and after talking about other things for a\r\nshort time, she left him and went sadly along the passage to her own\r\nroom. There must be some reason why such things happen, she thought to\r\nherself, as she shut the door. Only at first it was not easy to\r\nunderstand what it was. It seemed so strange\xe2\x80\x94so unbelievable. Why, only\r\nthree weeks ago\xe2\x80\x94only a fortnight ago, she had seen Rachel; when she\r\nshut her eyes she could almost see her now, the quiet, shy girl who was\r\ngoing to be married. She thought of all that she would have missed had\r\nshe died at Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s age, the children, the married life, the\r\nunimaginable depths and miracles that seemed to her, as she looked\r\nback, to have lain about her, day after day, and year after year. The\r\nstunned feeling, which had been making it difficult for her to think,\r\ngradually gave way to a feeling of the opposite nature; she thought\r\nvery quickly and very clearly, and, looking back over all her\r\nexperiences, tried to fit them into a kind of order. There was\r\nundoubtedly much suffering, much struggling, but, on the whole, surely\r\nthere was a balance of happiness\xe2\x80\x94surely order did prevail. Nor were the\r\ndeaths of young people really the saddest things in life\xe2\x80\x94they were\r\nsaved so much; they kept so much. The dead\xe2\x80\x94she called to mind those who\r\nhad died early, accidentally\xe2\x80\x94were beautiful; she often dreamt of the\r\ndead. And in time Terence himself would come to feel\xe2\x80\x94She got up and\r\nbegan to wander restlessly about the room.\r\n\r\nFor an old woman of her age she was very restless, and for one of her\r\nclear, quick mind she was unusually perplexed. She could not settle to\r\nanything, so that she was relieved when the door opened. She went up to\r\nher husband, took him in her arms, and kissed him with unusual\r\nintensity, and then as they sat down together she began to pat him and\r\nquestion him as if he were a baby, an old, tired, querulous baby. She\r\ndid not tell him about Miss Vinrace\xe2\x80\x99s death, for that would only\r\ndisturb him, and he was put out already. She tried to discover why he\r\nwas uneasy. Politics again? What were those horrid people doing? She\r\nspent the whole morning in discussing politics with her husband, and by\r\ndegrees she became deeply interested in what they were saying. But\r\nevery now and then what she was saying seemed to her oddly empty of\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nAt luncheon it was remarked by several people that the visitors at the\r\nhotel were beginning to leave; there were fewer every day. There were\r\nonly forty people at luncheon, instead of the sixty that there had\r\nbeen. So old Mrs. Paley computed, gazing about her with her faded eyes,\r\nas she took her seat at her own table in the window. Her party\r\ngenerally consisted of Mr. Perrott as well as Arthur and Susan, and\r\nto-day Evelyn was lunching with them also.\r\n\r\nShe was unusually subdued. Having noticed that her eyes were red, and\r\nguessing the reason, the others took pains to keep up an elaborate\r\nconversation between themselves. She suffered it to go on for a few\r\nminutes, leaning both elbows on the table, and leaving her soup\r\nuntouched, when she exclaimed suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you feel, but\r\nI can simply think of nothing else!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen murmured sympathetically, and looked grave.\r\n\r\nSusan replied, \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t it perfectly awful? When you think what a\r\nnice girl she was\xe2\x80\x94only just engaged, and this need never have\r\nhappened\xe2\x80\x94it seems too tragic.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at Arthur as though he might\r\nbe able to help her with something more suitable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHard lines,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur briefly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it was a foolish thing to do\xe2\x80\x94to\r\ngo up that river.\xe2\x80\x9d He shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cThey should have known better.\r\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t expect Englishwomen to stand roughing it as the natives do\r\nwho\xe2\x80\x99ve been acclimatised. I\xe2\x80\x99d half a mind to warn them at tea that day\r\nwhen it was being discussed. But it\xe2\x80\x99s no good saying these sort of\r\nthings\xe2\x80\x94it only puts people\xe2\x80\x99s backs up\xe2\x80\x94it never makes any difference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Mrs. Paley, hitherto contented with her soup, here intimated, by\r\nraising one hand to her ear, that she wished to know what was being\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou heard, Aunt Emma, that poor Miss Vinrace has died of the fever,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSusan informed her gently. She could not speak of death loudly or even\r\nin her usual voice, so that Mrs. Paley did not catch a word. Arthur\r\ncame to the rescue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vinrace is dead,\xe2\x80\x9d he said very distinctly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Paley merely bent a little towards him and asked, \xe2\x80\x9cEh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vinrace is dead,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. It was only by stiffening all the\r\nmuscles round his mouth that he could prevent himself from bursting\r\ninto laughter, and forced himself to repeat for the third time, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss\r\nVinrace. . . . She\xe2\x80\x99s dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLet alone the difficulty of hearing the exact words, facts that were\r\noutside her daily experience took some time to reach Mrs. Paley\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconsciousness. A weight seemed to rest upon her brain, impeding, though\r\nnot damaging its action. She sat vague-eyed for at least a minute\r\nbefore she realised what Arthur meant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead?\xe2\x80\x9d she said vaguely. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vinrace dead? Dear me . . . that\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\nsad. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t at the moment remember which she was. We seem to have\r\nmade so many new acquaintances here.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at Susan for help. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\ntall dark girl, who just missed being handsome, with a high colour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Susan interposed. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d then she gave it up in despair.\r\nThere was no use in explaining that Mrs. Paley was thinking of the\r\nwrong person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe ought not to have died,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Paley continued. \xe2\x80\x9cShe looked so\r\nstrong. But people will drink the water. I can never make out why. It\r\nseems such a simple thing to tell them to put a bottle of Seltzer water\r\nin your bedroom. That\xe2\x80\x99s all the precaution I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever taken, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen in every part of the world, I may say\xe2\x80\x94Italy a dozen times over. .\r\n. . But young people always think they know better, and then they pay\r\nthe penalty. Poor thing\xe2\x80\x94I am very sorry for her.\xe2\x80\x9d But the difficulty of\r\npeering into a dish of potatoes and helping herself engrossed her\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nArthur and Susan both secretly hoped that the subject was now disposed\r\nof, for there seemed to them something unpleasant in this discussion.\r\nBut Evelyn was not ready to let it drop. Why would people never talk\r\nabout the things that mattered?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you care a bit!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, turning savagely upon Mr.\r\nPerrott, who had sat all this time in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? Oh, yes, I do,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered awkwardly, but with obvious sincerity.\r\nEvelyn\xe2\x80\x99s questions made him too feel uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems so inexplicable,\xe2\x80\x9d Evelyn continued. \xe2\x80\x9cDeath, I mean. Why\r\nshould she be dead, and not you or I? It was only a fortnight ago that\r\nshe was here with the rest of us. What d\xe2\x80\x99you believe?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded of\r\nMr. Perrott. \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you believe that things go on, that she\xe2\x80\x99s still\r\nsomewhere\xe2\x80\x94or d\xe2\x80\x99you think it\xe2\x80\x99s simply a game\xe2\x80\x94we crumble up to nothing\r\nwhen we die? I\xe2\x80\x99m positive Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s not dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Perrott would have said almost anything that Evelyn wanted him to\r\nsay, but to assert that he believed in the immortality of the soul was\r\nnot in his power. He sat silent, more deeply wrinkled than usual,\r\ncrumbling his bread.\r\n\r\nLest Evelyn should next ask him what he believed, Arthur, after making\r\na pause equivalent to a full stop, started a completely different\r\ntopic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSupposing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ca man were to write and tell you that he wanted\r\nfive pounds because he had known your grandfather, what would you do?\r\nIt was this way. My grandfather\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInvented a stove,\xe2\x80\x9d said Evelyn. \xe2\x80\x9cI know all about that. We had one in\r\nthe conservatory to keep the plants warm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t know I was so famous,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,\r\ndetermined at all costs to spin his story out at length, \xe2\x80\x9cthe old chap,\r\nbeing about the second best inventor of his day, and a capable lawyer\r\ntoo, died, as they always do, without making a will. Now Fielding, his\r\nclerk, with how much justice I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, always claimed that he meant\r\nto do something for him. The poor old boy\xe2\x80\x99s come down in the world\r\nthrough trying inventions on his own account, lives in Penge over a\r\ntobacconist\xe2\x80\x99s shop. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to see him there. The question is\xe2\x80\x94must I\r\nstump up or not? What does the abstract spirit of justice require,\r\nPerrott? Remember, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t benefit under my grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s will, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve no way of testing the truth of the story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about the abstract spirit of justice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan,\r\nsmiling complacently at the others, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m certain of one thing\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nget his five pounds!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Perrott proceeded to deliver an opinion, and Evelyn insisted\r\nthat he was much too stingy, like all lawyers, thinking of the letter\r\nand not of the spirit, while Mrs. Paley required to be kept informed\r\nbetween the courses as to what they were all saying, the luncheon\r\npassed with no interval of silence, and Arthur congratulated himself\r\nupon the tact with which the discussion had been smoothed over.\r\n\r\nAs they left the room it happened that Mrs. Paley\xe2\x80\x99s wheeled chair ran\r\ninto the Elliots, who were coming through the door, as she was going\r\nout. Brought thus to a standstill for a moment, Arthur and Susan\r\ncongratulated Hughling Elliot upon his convalescence,\xe2\x80\x94he was down,\r\ncadaverous enough, for the first time,\xe2\x80\x94and Mr. Perrott took occasion to\r\nsay a few words in private to Evelyn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould there be any chance of seeing you this afternoon, about\r\nthree-thirty say? I shall be in the garden, by the fountain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe block dissolved before Evelyn answered. But as she left them in the\r\nhall, she looked at him brightly and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHalf-past three, did you\r\nsay? That\xe2\x80\x99ll suit me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe ran upstairs with the feeling of spiritual exaltation and quickened\r\nlife which the prospect of an emotional scene always aroused in her.\r\nThat Mr. Perrott was again about to propose to her, she had no doubt,\r\nand she was aware that on this occasion she ought to be prepared with a\r\ndefinite answer, for she was going away in three days\xe2\x80\x99 time. But she\r\ncould not bring her mind to bear upon the question. To come to a\r\ndecision was very difficult to her, because she had a natural dislike\r\nof anything final and done with; she liked to go on and on\xe2\x80\x94always on\r\nand on. She was leaving, and, therefore, she occupied herself in laying\r\nher clothes out side by side upon the bed. She observed that some were\r\nvery shabby. She took the photograph of her father and mother, and,\r\nbefore she laid it away in her box, she held it for a minute in her\r\nhand. Rachel had looked at it. Suddenly the keen feeling of some one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npersonality, which things that they have owned or handled sometimes\r\npreserves, overcame her; she felt Rachel in the room with her; it was\r\nas if she were on a ship at sea, and the life of the day was as unreal\r\nas the land in the distance. But by degrees the feeling of Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence passed away, and she could no longer realise her, for she had\r\nscarcely known her. But this momentary sensation left her depressed and\r\nfatigued. What had she done with her life? What future was there before\r\nher? What was make-believe, and what was real? Were these proposals and\r\nintimacies and adventures real, or was the contentment which she had\r\nseen on the faces of Susan and Rachel more real than anything she had\r\never felt?\r\n\r\nShe made herself ready to go downstairs, absentmindedly, but her\r\nfingers were so well trained that they did the work of preparing her\r\nalmost of their own accord. When she was actually on the way\r\ndownstairs, the blood began to circle through her body of its own\r\naccord too, for her mind felt very dull.\r\n\r\nMr. Perrott was waiting for her. Indeed, he had gone straight into the\r\ngarden after luncheon, and had been walking up and down the path for\r\nmore than half an hour, in a state of acute suspense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m late as usual!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, as she caught sight of him. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nyou must forgive me; I had to pack up. . . . My word! It looks stormy!\r\nAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s a new steamer in the bay, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at the bay, in which a steamer was just dropping anchor, the\r\nsmoke still hanging about it, while a swift black shudder ran through\r\nthe waves. \xe2\x80\x9cOne\xe2\x80\x99s quite forgotten what rain looks like,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Perrott paid no attention to the steamer or to the weather.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Murgatroyd,\xe2\x80\x9d he began with his usual formality, \xe2\x80\x9cI asked you to\r\ncome here from a very selfish motive, I fear. I do not think you need\r\nto be assured once more of my feelings; but, as you are leaving so\r\nsoon, I felt that I could not let you go without asking you to tell\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94have I any reason to hope that you will ever come to care for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was very pale, and seemed unable to say any more.\r\n\r\nThe little gush of vitality which had come into Evelyn as she ran\r\ndownstairs had left her, and she felt herself impotent. There was\r\nnothing for her to say; she felt nothing. Now that he was actually\r\nasking her, in his elderly gentle words, to marry him, she felt less\r\nfor him than she had ever felt before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s sit down and talk it over,\xe2\x80\x9d she said rather unsteadily.\r\n\r\nMr. Perrott followed her to a curved green seat under a tree. They\r\nlooked at the fountain in front of them, which had long ceased to play.\r\nEvelyn kept looking at the fountain instead of thinking of what she was\r\nsaying; the fountain without any water seemed to be the type of her own\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I care for you,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, rushing her words out in a\r\nhurry; \xe2\x80\x9cI should be a brute if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I think you\xe2\x80\x99re quite one of\r\nthe nicest people I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever known, and one of the finest too. But I\r\nwish . . . I wish you didn\xe2\x80\x99t care for me in that way. Are you sure you\r\ndo?\xe2\x80\x9d For the moment she honestly desired that he should say no.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Perrott.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, I\xe2\x80\x99m not as simple as most women,\xe2\x80\x9d Evelyn continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI think\r\nI want more. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly what I feel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat by her, watching her and refraining from speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sometimes think I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got it in me to care very much for one\r\nperson only. Some one else would make you a better wife. I can imagine\r\nyou very happy with some one else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you think that there is any chance that you will come to care for\r\nme, I am quite content to wait,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Perrott.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s no hurry, is there?\xe2\x80\x9d said Evelyn. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I thought it\r\nover and wrote and told you when I get back? I\xe2\x80\x99m going to Moscow; I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwrite from Moscow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Perrott persisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot give me any kind of idea. I do not ask for a date . . .\r\nthat would be most unreasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused, looking down at the gravel\r\npath.\r\n\r\nAs she did not immediately answer, he went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know very well that I am not\xe2\x80\x94that I have not much to offer you\r\neither in myself or in my circumstances. And I forget; it cannot seem\r\nthe miracle to you that it does to me. Until I met you I had gone on in\r\nmy own quiet way\xe2\x80\x94we are both very quiet people, my sister and I\xe2\x80\x94quite\r\ncontent with my lot. My friendship with Arthur was the most important\r\nthing in my life. Now that I know you, all that has changed. You seem\r\nto put such a spirit into everything. Life seems to hold so many\r\npossibilities that I had never dreamt of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s splendid!\xe2\x80\x9d Evelyn exclaimed, grasping his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cNow you\xe2\x80\x99ll go\r\nback and start all kinds of things and make a great name in the world;\r\nand we\xe2\x80\x99ll go on being friends, whatever happens . . . we\xe2\x80\x99ll be great\r\nfriends, won\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvelyn!\xe2\x80\x9d he moaned suddenly, and took her in his arms, and kissed her.\r\nShe did not resent it, although it made little impression on her.\r\n\r\nAs she sat upright again, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI never see why one shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\non being friends\xe2\x80\x94though some people do. And friendships do make a\r\ndifference, don\xe2\x80\x99t they? They are the kind of things that matter in\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with a bewildered expression as if he did not really\r\nunderstand what she was saying. With a considerable effort he collected\r\nhimself, stood up, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow I think I have told you what I feel,\r\nand I will only add that I can wait as long as ever you wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLeft alone, Evelyn walked up and down the path. What did matter then?\r\nWhat was the meaning of it all?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that evening the clouds gathered, until they closed entirely over\r\nthe blue of the sky. They seemed to narrow the space between earth and\r\nheaven, so that there was no room for the air to move in freely; and\r\nthe waves, too, lay flat, and yet rigid, as if they were restrained.\r\nThe leaves on the bushes and trees in the garden hung closely together,\r\nand the feeling of pressure and restraint was increased by the short\r\nchirping sounds which came from birds and insects.\r\n\r\nSo strange were the lights and the silence that the busy hum of voices\r\nwhich usually filled the dining-room at meal times had distinct gaps in\r\nit, and during these silences the clatter of the knives upon plates\r\nbecame audible. The first roll of thunder and the first heavy drop\r\nstriking the pane caused a little stir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s coming!\xe2\x80\x9d was said simultaneously in many different languages.\r\n\r\nThere was then a profound silence, as if the thunder had withdrawn into\r\nitself. People had just begun to eat again, when a gust of cold air\r\ncame through the open windows, lifting tablecloths and skirts, a light\r\nflashed, and was instantly followed by a clap of thunder right over the\r\nhotel. The rain swished with it, and immediately there were all those\r\nsounds of windows being shut and doors slamming violently which\r\naccompany a storm.\r\n\r\nThe room grew suddenly several degrees darker, for the wind seemed to\r\nbe driving waves of darkness across the earth. No one attempted to eat\r\nfor a time, but sat looking out at the garden, with their forks in the\r\nair. The flashes now came frequently, lighting up faces as if they were\r\ngoing to be photographed, surprising them in tense and unnatural\r\nexpressions. The clap followed close and violently upon them. Several\r\nwomen half rose from their chairs and then sat down again, but dinner\r\nwas continued uneasily with eyes upon the garden. The bushes outside\r\nwere ruffled and whitened, and the wind pressed upon them so that they\r\nseemed to stoop to the ground. The waiters had to press dishes upon the\r\ndiners\xe2\x80\x99 notice; and the diners had to draw the attention of waiters,\r\nfor they were all absorbed in looking at the storm. As the thunder\r\nshowed no signs of withdrawing, but seemed massed right overhead, while\r\nthe lightning aimed straight at the garden every time, an uneasy gloom\r\nreplaced the first excitement.\r\n\r\nFinishing the meal very quickly, people congregated in the hall, where\r\nthey felt more secure than in any other place because they could\r\nretreat far from the windows, and although they heard the thunder, they\r\ncould not see anything. A little boy was carried away sobbing in the\r\narms of his mother.\r\n\r\nWhile the storm continued, no one seemed inclined to sit down, but they\r\ncollected in little groups under the central skylight, where they stood\r\nin a yellow atmosphere, looking upwards. Now and again their faces\r\nbecame white, as the lightning flashed, and finally a terrific crash\r\ncame, making the panes of the skylight lift at the joints.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d several voices exclaimed at the same moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething struck,\xe2\x80\x9d said a man\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\nThe rain rushed down. The rain seemed now to extinguish the lightning\r\nand the thunder, and the hall became almost dark.\r\n\r\nAfter a minute or two, when nothing was heard but the rattle of water\r\nupon the glass, there was a perceptible slackening of the sound, and\r\nthen the atmosphere became lighter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s over,\xe2\x80\x9d said another voice.\r\n\r\nAt a touch, all the electric lights were turned on, and revealed a\r\ncrowd of people all standing, all looking with rather strained faces up\r\nat the skylight, but when they saw each other in the artificial light\r\nthey turned at once and began to move away. For some minutes the rain\r\ncontinued to rattle upon the skylight, and the thunder gave another\r\nshake or two; but it was evident from the clearing of the darkness and\r\nthe light drumming of the rain upon the roof, that the great confused\r\nocean of air was travelling away from them, and passing high over head\r\nwith its clouds and its rods of fire, out to sea. The building, which\r\nhad seemed so small in the tumult of the storm, now became as square\r\nand spacious as usual.\r\n\r\nAs the storm drew away, the people in the hall of the hotel sat down;\r\nand with a comfortable sense of relief, began to tell each other\r\nstories about great storms, and produced in many cases their\r\noccupations for the evening. The chess-board was brought out, and Mr.\r\nElliot, who wore a stock instead of a collar as a sign of\r\nconvalescence, but was otherwise much as usual, challenged Mr. Pepper\r\nto a final contest. Round them gathered a group of ladies with pieces\r\nof needlework, or in default of needlework, with novels, to superintend\r\nthe game, much as if they were in charge of two small boys playing\r\nmarbles. Every now and then they looked at the board and made some\r\nencouraging remark to the gentlemen.\r\n\r\nMrs. Paley just round the corner had her cards arranged in long ladders\r\nbefore her, with Susan sitting near to sympathise but not to correct,\r\nand the merchants and the miscellaneous people who had never been\r\ndiscovered to possess names were stretched in their arm-chairs with\r\ntheir newspapers on their knees. The conversation in these\r\ncircumstances was very gentle, fragmentary, and intermittent, but the\r\nroom was full of the indescribable stir of life. Every now and then the\r\nmoth, which was now grey of wing and shiny of thorax, whizzed over\r\ntheir heads, and hit the lamps with a thud.\r\n\r\nA young woman put down her needlework and exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor creature! it\r\nwould be kinder to kill it.\xe2\x80\x9d But nobody seemed disposed to rouse\r\nhimself in order to kill the moth. They watched it dash from lamp to\r\nlamp, because they were comfortable, and had nothing to do.\r\n\r\nOn the sofa, beside the chess-players, Mrs. Elliot was imparting a new\r\nstitch in knitting to Mrs. Thornbury, so that their heads came very\r\nnear together, and were only to be distinguished by the old lace cap\r\nwhich Mrs. Thornbury wore in the evening. Mrs. Elliot was an expert at\r\nknitting, and disclaimed a compliment to that effect with evident\r\npride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose we\xe2\x80\x99re all proud of something,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of\r\nmy knitting. I think things like that run in families. We all knit\r\nwell. I had an uncle who knitted his own socks to the day of his\r\ndeath\xe2\x80\x94and he did it better than any of his daughters, dear old\r\ngentleman. Now I wonder that you, Miss Allan, who use your eyes so\r\nmuch, don\xe2\x80\x99t take up knitting in the evenings. You\xe2\x80\x99d find it such a\r\nrelief, I should say\xe2\x80\x94such a rest to the eyes\xe2\x80\x94and the bazaars are so\r\nglad of things.\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice dropped into the smooth half-conscious tone\r\nof the expert knitter; the words came gently one after another. \xe2\x80\x9cAs\r\nmuch as I do I can always dispose of, which is a comfort, for then I\r\nfeel that I am not wasting my time\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Allan, being thus addressed, shut her novel and observed the\r\nothers placidly for a time. At last she said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is surely not natural\r\nto leave your wife because she happens to be in love with you. But\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94as far as I can make out\xe2\x80\x94is what the gentleman in my story does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTut, tut, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound good\xe2\x80\x94no, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound at all\r\nnatural,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the knitters in their absorbed voices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, it\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of book people call very clever,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Allan\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Maternity_\xe2\x80\x94by Michael Jessop\xe2\x80\x94I presume,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Elliot put in, for he\r\ncould never resist the temptation of talking while he played chess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Elliot, after a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think people\r\n_do_ write good novels now\xe2\x80\x94not as good as they used to, anyhow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo one took the trouble to agree with her or to disagree with her.\r\nArthur Venning who was strolling about, sometimes looking at the game,\r\nsometimes reading a page of a magazine, looked at Miss Allan, who was\r\nhalf asleep, and said humorously, \xe2\x80\x9cA penny for your thoughts, Miss\r\nAllan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe others looked up. They were glad that he had not spoken to them.\r\nBut Miss Allan replied without any hesitation, \xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking of my\r\nimaginary uncle. Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t every one got an imaginary uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued. \xe2\x80\x9cI have one\xe2\x80\x94a most delightful old gentleman. He\xe2\x80\x99s always\r\ngiving me things. Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s a gold watch; sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ncarriage and pair; sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful little cottage in the New\r\nForest; sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s a ticket to the place I most want to see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe set them all thinking vaguely of the things they wanted. Mrs.\r\nElliot knew exactly what she wanted; she wanted a child; and the usual\r\nlittle pucker deepened on her brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re such lucky people,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking at her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cWe really\r\nhave no wants.\xe2\x80\x9d She was apt to say this, partly in order to convince\r\nherself, and partly in order to convince other people. But she was\r\nprevented from wondering how far she carried conviction by the entrance\r\nof Mr. and Mrs. Flushing, who came through the hall and stopped by the\r\nchess-board. Mrs. Flushing looked wilder than ever. A great strand of\r\nblack hair looped down across her brow, her cheeks were whipped a dark\r\nblood red, and drops of rain made wet marks upon them.\r\n\r\nMr. Flushing explained that they had been on the roof watching the\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a wonderful sight,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe lightning went right out over\r\nthe sea, and lit up the waves and the ships far away. You can\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nhow wonderful the mountains looked too, with the lights on them, and\r\nthe great masses of shadow. It\xe2\x80\x99s all over now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe slid down into a chair, becoming interested in the final struggle of\r\nthe game.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you go back to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Thornbury, looking at Mrs.\r\nFlushing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd indeed one is not sorry to go back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Elliot, assuming an\r\nair of mournful anxiety, \xe2\x80\x9cafter all this illness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you afraid of dyin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Flushing demanded scornfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we are all afraid of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Elliot with dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose we\xe2\x80\x99re all cowards when it comes to the point,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nFlushing, rubbing her cheek against the back of the chair. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\r\nam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Flushing, turning round, for Mr. Pepper\r\ntook a very long time to consider his move. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not cowardly to wish\r\nto live, Alice. It\xe2\x80\x99s the very reverse of cowardly. Personally, I\xe2\x80\x99d like\r\nto go on for a hundred years\xe2\x80\x94granted, of course, that I had the full\r\nuse of my faculties. Think of all the things that are bound to happen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I feel,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Thornbury rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cThe changes, the\r\nimprovements, the inventions\xe2\x80\x94and beauty. D\xe2\x80\x99you know I feel sometimes\r\nthat I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to die and cease to see beautiful things about\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would certainly be very dull to die before they have discovered\r\nwhether there is life in Mars,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Allan added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really believe there\xe2\x80\x99s life in Mars?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Flushing,\r\nturning to her for the first time with keen interest. \xe2\x80\x9cWho tells you\r\nthat? Some one who knows? D\xe2\x80\x99you know a man called\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Mrs. Thornbury laid down her knitting, and a look of extreme\r\nsolicitude came into her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is Mr. Hirst,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly.\r\n\r\nSt. John had just come through the swing door. He was rather blown\r\nabout by the wind, and his cheeks looked terribly pale, unshorn, and\r\ncavernous. After taking off his coat he was going to pass straight\r\nthrough the hall and up to his room, but he could not ignore the\r\npresence of so many people he knew, especially as Mrs. Thornbury rose\r\nand went up to him, holding out her hand. But the shock of the warm\r\nlamp-lit room, together with the sight of so many cheerful human beings\r\nsitting together at their ease, after the dark walk in the rain, and\r\nthe long days of strain and horror, overcame him completely. He looked\r\nat Mrs. Thornbury and could not speak.\r\n\r\nEvery one was silent. Mr. Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s hand stayed upon his Knight. Mrs.\r\nThornbury somehow moved him to a chair, sat herself beside him, and\r\nwith tears in her own eyes said gently, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have done everything for\r\nyour friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer action set them all talking again as if they had never stopped, and\r\nMr. Pepper finished the move with his Knight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was nothing to be done,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. John. He spoke very slowly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems impossible\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew his hand across his eyes as if some dream came between him and\r\nthe others and prevented him from seeing where he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that poor fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Thornbury, the tears falling again\r\ndown her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible,\xe2\x80\x9d St. John repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he have the consolation of knowing\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Thornbury began very\r\ntentatively.\r\n\r\nBut St. John made no reply. He lay back in his chair, half-seeing the\r\nothers, half-hearing what they said. He was terribly tired, and the\r\nlight and warmth, the movements of the hands, and the soft\r\ncommunicative voices soothed him; they gave him a strange sense of\r\nquiet and relief. As he sat there, motionless, this feeling of relief\r\nbecame a feeling of profound happiness. Without any sense of disloyalty\r\nto Terence and Rachel he ceased to think about either of them. The\r\nmovements and the voices seemed to draw together from different parts\r\nof the room, and to combine themselves into a pattern before his eyes;\r\nhe was content to sit silently watching the pattern build itself up,\r\nlooking at what he hardly saw.\r\n\r\nThe game was really a good one, and Mr. Pepper and Mr. Elliot were\r\nbecoming more and more set upon the struggle. Mrs. Thornbury, seeing\r\nthat St. John did not wish to talk, resumed her knitting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLightning again!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Flushing suddenly exclaimed. A yellow light\r\nflashed across the blue window, and for a second they saw the green\r\ntrees outside. She strode to the door, pushed it open, and stood half\r\nout in the open air.\r\n\r\nBut the light was only the reflection of the storm which was over. The\r\nrain had ceased, the heavy clouds were blown away, and the air was thin\r\nand clear, although vapourish mists were being driven swiftly across\r\nthe moon. The sky was once more a deep and solemn blue, and the shape\r\nof the earth was visible at the bottom of the air, enormous, dark, and\r\nsolid, rising into the tapering mass of the mountain, and pricked here\r\nand there on the slopes by the tiny lights of villas. The driving air,\r\nthe drone of the trees, and the flashing light which now and again\r\nspread a broad illumination over the earth filled Mrs. Flushing with\r\nexultation. Her breasts rose and fell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSplendid! Splendid!\xe2\x80\x9d she muttered to herself. Then she turned back\r\ninto the hall and exclaimed in a peremptory voice, \xe2\x80\x9cCome outside and\r\nsee, Wilfrid; it\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome half-stirred; some rose; some dropped their balls of wool and\r\nbegan to stoop to look for them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo bed\xe2\x80\x94to bed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Allan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the move with your Queen that gave it away, Pepper,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed\r\nMr. Elliot triumphantly, sweeping the pieces together and standing up.\r\nHe had won the game.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Pepper beaten at last? I congratulate you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur Venning,\r\nwho was wheeling old Mrs. Paley to bed.\r\n\r\nAll these voices sounded gratefully in St. John\xe2\x80\x99s ears as he lay\r\nhalf-asleep, and yet vividly conscious of everything around him. Across\r\nhis eyes passed a procession of objects, black and indistinct, the\r\nfigures of people picking up their books, their cards, their balls of\r\nwool, their work-baskets, and passing him one after another on their\r\nway to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE VOYAGE OUT ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
