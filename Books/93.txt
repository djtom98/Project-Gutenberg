I\r\ntake them from an old-time Swedish criminal trial, change the actors,\r\nand transfer the scenes to America.  I have added some details, but\r\nonly a couple of them are important ones. \xe2\x80\x94 M. T.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, it was the next spring after me and Tom Sawyer set our old nigger\r\nJim free, the time he was chained up for a runaway slave down there on\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s uncle Silas\xe2\x80\x99s farm in Arkansaw. The frost was working out of the\r\nground, and out of the air, too, and it was getting closer and closer\r\nonto barefoot time every day; and next it would be marble time, and\r\nnext mumbletypeg, and next tops and hoops, and next kites, and then\r\nright away it would be summer and going in a-swimming. It just makes a\r\nboy homesick to look ahead like that and see how far off summer is.\r\nYes, and it sets him to sighing and saddening around, and there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsomething the matter with him, he don\xe2\x80\x99t know what. But anyway, he gets\r\nout by himself and mopes and thinks; and mostly he hunts for a lonesome\r\nplace high up on the hill in the edge of the woods, and sets there and\r\nlooks away off on the big Mississippi down there a-reaching miles and\r\nmiles around the points where the timber looks smoky and dim it\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\nfar off and still, and everything\xe2\x80\x99s so solemn it seems like everybody\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve loved is dead and gone, and you \xe2\x80\x99most wish you was dead and gone\r\ntoo, and done with it all.\r\n\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know what that is? It\xe2\x80\x99s spring fever. That is what the name\r\nof it is. And when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got it, you want\xe2\x80\x94oh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t quite know\r\nwhat it is you _do_ want, but it just fairly makes your heart ache, you\r\nwant it so! It seems to you that mainly what you want is to get away;\r\nget away from the same old tedious things you\xe2\x80\x99re so used to seeing and\r\nso tired of, and set something new. That is the idea; you want to go\r\nand be a wanderer; you want to go wandering far away to strange\r\ncountries where everything is mysterious and wonderful and romantic.\r\nAnd if you can\xe2\x80\x99t do that, you\xe2\x80\x99ll put up with considerable less; you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngo anywhere you _can_ go, just so as to get away, and be thankful of\r\nthe chance, too.\r\n\r\nWell, me and Tom Sawyer had the spring fever, and had it bad, too; but\r\nit warn\xe2\x80\x99t any use to think about Tom trying to get away, because, as he\r\nsaid, his Aunt Polly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let him quit school and go traipsing off\r\nsomers wasting time; so we was pretty blue. We was setting on the front\r\nsteps one day about sundown talking this way, when out comes his aunt\r\nPolly with a letter in her hand and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom, I reckon you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to pack up and go down to Arkansaw\xe2\x80\x94your aunt\r\nSally wants you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI \xe2\x80\x99most jumped out of my skin for joy. I reckoned Tom would fly at his\r\naunt and hug her head off; but if you believe me he set there like a\r\nrock, and never said a word. It made me fit to cry to see him act so\r\nfoolish, with such a noble chance as this opening up. Why, we might\r\nlose it if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak up and show he was thankful and grateful.\r\nBut he set there and studied and studied till I was that distressed I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do; then he says, very ca\xe2\x80\x99m, and I could a shot him\r\nfor it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m right down sorry, Aunt Polly, but I reckon I got\r\nto be excused\xe2\x80\x94for the present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis aunt Polly was knocked so stupid and so mad at the cold impudence\r\nof it that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say a word for as much as a half a minute, and\r\nthis gave me a chance to nudge Tom and whisper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t you got any sense? Sp\xe2\x80\x99iling such a noble chance as this and\r\nthrowing it away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he warn\xe2\x80\x99t disturbed. He mumbled back:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuck Finn, do you want me to let her _see_ how bad I want to go? Why,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d begin to doubt, right away, and imagine a lot of sicknesses and\r\ndangers and objections, and first you know she\xe2\x80\x99d take it all back. You\r\nlemme alone; I reckon I know how to work her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow I never would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 thought of that. But he was right. Tom Sawyer was\r\nalways right\xe2\x80\x94the levelest head I ever see, and always _at_ himself and\r\nready for anything you might spring on him. By this time his aunt Polly\r\nwas all straight again, and she let fly. She says:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I reckon I got to be excused]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be excused! _you_ will! Well, I never heard the like of it in\r\nall my days! The idea of you talking like that to _me!_ Now take\r\nyourself off and pack your traps; and if I hear another word out of you\r\nabout what you\xe2\x80\x99ll be excused from and what you won\xe2\x80\x99t, I lay _I\xe2\x80\x99ll_\r\nexcuse you\xe2\x80\x94with a hickory!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hit his head a thump with her thimble as we dodged by, and he let\r\non to be whimpering as we struck for the stairs. Up in his room he\r\nhugged me, he was so out of his head for gladness because he was going\r\ntraveling. And he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore we get away she\xe2\x80\x99ll wish she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t let me go, but she won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow any way to get around it now. After what she\xe2\x80\x99s said, her pride\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t let her take it back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom was packed in ten minutes, all except what his aunt and Mary would\r\nfinish up for him; then we waited ten more for her to get cooled down\r\nand sweet and gentle again; for Tom said it took her ten minutes to\r\nunruffle in times when half of her feathers was up, but twenty when\r\nthey was all up, and this was one of the times when they was all up.\r\nThen we went down, being in a sweat to know what the letter said.\r\n\r\nShe was setting there in a brown study, with it laying in her lap. We\r\nset down, and she says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re in considerable trouble down there, and they think you and\r\nHuck\xe2\x80\x99ll be a kind of diversion for them\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99comfort,\xe2\x80\x99 they say. Much of\r\nthat they\xe2\x80\x99ll get out of you and Huck Finn, I reckon. There\xe2\x80\x99s a neighbor\r\nnamed Brace Dunlap that\xe2\x80\x99s been wanting to marry their Benny for three\r\nmonths, and at last they told him point blank and once for all, he\r\n_could\xe2\x80\x99t;_ so he has soured on them, and they\xe2\x80\x99re worried about it. I\r\nreckon he\xe2\x80\x99s somebody they think they better be on the good side of, for\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to please him by hiring his no-account brother to help on\r\nthe farm when they can\xe2\x80\x99t hardly afford it, and don\xe2\x80\x99t want him around\r\nanyhow. Who are the Dunlaps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey live about a mile from Uncle Silas\xe2\x80\x99s place, Aunt Polly\xe2\x80\x94all the\r\nfarmers live about a mile apart down there\xe2\x80\x94and Brace Dunlap is a long\r\nsight richer than any of the others, and owns a whole grist of niggers.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s a widower, thirty-six years old, without any children, and is\r\nproud of his money and overbearing, and everybody is a little afraid of\r\nhim. I judge he thought he could have any girl he wanted, just for the\r\nasking, and it must have set him back a good deal when he found he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get Benny. Why, Benny\xe2\x80\x99s only half as old as he is, and just as\r\nsweet and lovely as\xe2\x80\x94well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her. Poor old Uncle Silas\xe2\x80\x94why,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s pitiful, him trying to curry favor that way\xe2\x80\x94so hard pushed and\r\npoor, and yet hiring that useless Jubiter Dunlap to please his ornery\r\nbrother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a name\xe2\x80\x94Jubiter! Where\xe2\x80\x99d he get it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only just a nickname. I reckon they\xe2\x80\x99ve forgot his real name long\r\nbefore this. He\xe2\x80\x99s twenty-seven, now, and has had it ever since the\r\nfirst time he ever went in swimming. The school teacher seen a round\r\nbrown mole the size of a dime on his left leg above his knee, and four\r\nlittle bits of moles around it, when he was naked, and he said it\r\nminded him of Jubiter and his moons; and the children thought it was\r\nfunny, and so they got to calling him Jubiter, and he\xe2\x80\x99s Jubiter yet.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s tall, and lazy, and sly, and sneaky, and ruther cowardly, too, but\r\nkind of good-natured, and wears long brown hair and no beard, and\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t got a cent, and Brace boards him for nothing, and gives him his\r\nold clothes to wear, and despises him. Jubiter is a twin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s t\xe2\x80\x99other twin like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust exactly like Jubiter\xe2\x80\x94so they say; used to was, anyway, but he\r\nhain\xe2\x80\x99t been seen for seven years. He got to robbing when he was\r\nnineteen or twenty, and they jailed him; but he broke jail and got\r\naway\xe2\x80\x94up North here, somers. They used to hear about him robbing and\r\nburglaring now and then, but that was years ago. He\xe2\x80\x99s dead, now. At\r\nleast that\xe2\x80\x99s what they say. They don\xe2\x80\x99t hear about him any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was his name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything more said for a considerable while; the old lady\r\nwas thinking. At last she says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe thing that is mostly worrying your aunt Sally is the tempers that\r\nthat man Jubiter gets your uncle into.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom was astonished, and so was I. Tom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTempers? Uncle Silas? Land, you must be joking! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know he _had_\r\nany temper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorks him up into perfect rages, your aunt Sally says; says he acts as\r\nif he would really hit the man, sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt Polly, it beats anything I ever heard of. Why, he\xe2\x80\x99s just as\r\ngentle as mush.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she\xe2\x80\x99s worried, anyway. Says your uncle Silas is like a changed\r\nman, on account of all this quarreling. And the neighbors talk about\r\nit, and lay all the blame on your uncle, of course, because he\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\npreacher and hain\xe2\x80\x99t got any business to quarrel. Your aunt Sally says\r\nhe hates to go into the pulpit he\xe2\x80\x99s so ashamed; and the people have\r\nbegun to cool toward him, and he ain\xe2\x80\x99t as popular now as he used to\r\nwas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it strange? Why, Aunt Polly, he was always so good and\r\nkind and moony and absent-minded and chuckle-headed and lovable\xe2\x80\x94why, he\r\nwas just an angel! What _can_ be the matter of him, do you reckon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nJAKE DUNLAP\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had powerful good luck; because we got a chance in a stern-wheeler\r\nfrom away North which was bound for one of them bayous or one-horse\r\nrivers away down Louisiana way, and so we could go all the way down the\r\nUpper Mississippi and all the way down the Lower Mississippi to that\r\nfarm in Arkansaw without having to change steamboats at St. Louis; not\r\nso very much short of a thousand miles at one pull.\r\n\r\nA pretty lonesome boat; there warn\xe2\x80\x99t but few passengers, and all old\r\nfolks, that set around, wide apart, dozing, and was very quiet. We was\r\nfour days getting out of the \xe2\x80\x9cupper river,\xe2\x80\x9d because we got aground so\r\nmuch. But it warn\xe2\x80\x99t dull\xe2\x80\x94couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be for boys that was traveling, of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nFrom the very start me and Tom allowed that there was somebody sick in\r\nthe stateroom next to ourn, because the meals was always toted in there\r\nby the waiters. By and by we asked about it\xe2\x80\x94Tom did and the waiter said\r\nit was a man, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t look sick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but _ain\xe2\x80\x99t_ he sick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know; maybe he is, but \xe2\x80\x99pears to me he\xe2\x80\x99s just letting on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you think that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause if he was sick he would pull his clothes off _some_ time or\r\nother\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you reckon he would? Well, this one don\xe2\x80\x99t. At least he\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t ever pull off his boots, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mischief he don\xe2\x80\x99t! Not even when he goes to bed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was always nuts for Tom Sawyer\xe2\x80\x94a mystery was. If you\xe2\x80\x99d lay out a\r\nmystery and a pie before me and him, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to say take your\r\nchoice; it was a thing that would regulate itself. Because in my nature\r\nI have always run to pie, whilst in his nature he has always run to\r\nmystery. People are made different. And it is the best way. Tom says to\r\nthe waiter:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the man\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhillips.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99d he come aboard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he got aboard at Elexandria, up on the Iowa line.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you reckon he\xe2\x80\x99s a-playing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hain\xe2\x80\x99t any notion\xe2\x80\x94I never thought of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI says to myself, here\xe2\x80\x99s another one that runs to pie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything peculiar about him?\xe2\x80\x94the way he acts or talks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94nothing, except he seems so scary, and keeps his doors locked night\r\nand day both, and when you knock he won\xe2\x80\x99t let you in till he opens the\r\ndoor a crack and sees who it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy jimminy, it\xe2\x80\x99s int\xe2\x80\x99resting! I\xe2\x80\x99d like to get a look at him. Say\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nnext time you\xe2\x80\x99re going in there, don\xe2\x80\x99t you reckon you could spread the\r\ndoor and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeedy! He\xe2\x80\x99s always behind it. He would block that game.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom studied over it, and then he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLooky here. You lend me your apern and let me take him his breakfast\r\nin the morning. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a quarter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy was plenty willing enough, if the head steward wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\r\nTom says that\xe2\x80\x99s all right, he reckoned he could fix it with the head\r\nsteward; and he done it. He fixed it so as we could both go in with\r\naperns on and toting vittles.\r\n\r\nHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep much, he was in such a sweat to get in there and find\r\nout the mystery about Phillips; and moreover he done a lot of guessing\r\nabout it all night, which warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use, for if you are going to find\r\nout the facts of a thing, what\xe2\x80\x99s the sense in guessing out what ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthe facts and wasting ammunition? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t lose no sleep. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngive a dern to know what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter of Phillips, I says to myself.\r\n\r\nWell, in the morning we put on the aperns and got a couple of trays of\r\ntruck, and Tom he knocked on the door. The man opened it a crack, and\r\nthen he let us in and shut it quick. By Jackson, when we got a sight of\r\nhim, we \xe2\x80\x99most dropped the trays! and Tom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Jubiter Dunlap, where\xe2\x80\x99d _you_ come from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, the man was astonished, of course; and first off he looked like\r\nhe didn\xe2\x80\x99t know whether to be scared, or glad, or both, or which, but\r\nfinally he settled down to being glad; and then his color come back,\r\nthough at first his face had turned pretty white. So we got to talking\r\ntogether while he et his breakfast. And he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I aint Jubiter Dunlap. I\xe2\x80\x99d just as soon tell you who I am, though,\r\nif you\xe2\x80\x99ll swear to keep mum, for I ain\xe2\x80\x99t no Phillips, either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll keep mum, but there ain\xe2\x80\x99t any need to tell who you are if you\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t Jubiter Dunlap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause if you ain\xe2\x80\x99t him you\xe2\x80\x99re t\xe2\x80\x99other twin, Jake. You\xe2\x80\x99re the spit\xe2\x80\x99n\r\nimage of Jubiter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m Jake. But looky here, how do you come to know us Dunlaps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom told about the adventures we\xe2\x80\x99d had down there at his uncle Silas\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlast summer, and when he see that there warn\xe2\x80\x99t anything about his\r\nfolks\xe2\x80\x94or him either, for that matter\xe2\x80\x94that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know, he opened out\r\nand talked perfectly free and candid. He never made any bones about his\r\nown case; said he\xe2\x80\x99d been a hard lot, was a hard lot yet, and reckoned\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d be a hard lot plumb to the end. He said of course it was a\r\ndangerous life, and\xe2\x80\x94He give a kind of gasp, and set his head like a\r\nperson that\xe2\x80\x99s listening. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything, and so it was very\r\nstill for a second or so, and there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no sounds but the screaking\r\nof the woodwork and the chug-chugging of the machinery down below.\r\n\r\nThen we got him comfortable again, telling him about his people, and\r\nhow Brace\xe2\x80\x99s wife had been dead three years, and Brace wanted to marry\r\nBenny and she shook him, and Jubiter was working for Uncle Silas, and\r\nhim and Uncle Silas quarreling all the time\xe2\x80\x94and then he let go and\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLand!\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s like old times to hear all this tittle-tattle,\r\nand does me good. It\xe2\x80\x99s been seven years and more since I heard any. How\r\ndo they talk about me these days?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe farmers\xe2\x80\x94and the family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, they don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about you at all\xe2\x80\x94at least only just a mention,\r\nonce in a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe nation!\xe2\x80\x9d he says, surprised; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause they think you are dead long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! Are you speaking true?\xe2\x80\x94honor bright, now.\xe2\x80\x9d He jumped up, excited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonor bright. There ain\xe2\x80\x99t anybody thinks you are alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99m saved, I\xe2\x80\x99m saved, sure! I\xe2\x80\x99ll go home. They\xe2\x80\x99ll hide me and\r\nsave my life. You keep mum. Swear you\xe2\x80\x99ll keep mum\xe2\x80\x94swear you\xe2\x80\x99ll never,\r\nnever tell on me. Oh, boys, be good to a poor devil that\xe2\x80\x99s being hunted\r\nday and night, and dasn\xe2\x80\x99t show his face! I\xe2\x80\x99ve never done you any harm;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll never do you any, as God is in the heavens; swear you\xe2\x80\x99ll be good\r\nto me and help me save my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Swear you\xe2\x80\x99ll be good to me and help me save my life.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99d a swore it if he\xe2\x80\x99d been a dog; and so we done it. Well, he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t love us enough for it or be grateful enough, poor cuss; it was\r\nall he could do to keep from hugging us.\r\n\r\nWe talked along, and he got out a little hand-bag and begun to open it,\r\nand told us to turn our backs. We done it, and when he told us to turn\r\nagain he was perfectly different to what he was before. He had on blue\r\ngoggles and the naturalest-looking long brown whiskers and mustashes\r\nyou ever see. His own mother wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 knowed him. He asked us if he\r\nlooked like his brother Jubiter, now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom said; \xe2\x80\x9cthere ain\xe2\x80\x99t anything left that\xe2\x80\x99s like him except the\r\nlong hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get that cropped close to my head before I get there;\r\nthen him and Brace will keep my secret, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll live with them as\r\nbeing a stranger, and the neighbors won\xe2\x80\x99t ever guess me out. What do\r\nyou think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom he studied awhile, then he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course me and Huck are going to keep mum there, but if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t keep mum yourself there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a little bit of a risk\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t much, maybe, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a little. I mean, if you talk, won\xe2\x80\x99t people\r\nnotice that your voice is just like Jubiter\xe2\x80\x99s; and mightn\xe2\x80\x99t it make\r\nthem think of the twin they reckoned was dead, but maybe after all was\r\nhid all this time under another name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy George,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re a sharp one! You\xe2\x80\x99re perfectly right. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot to play deef and dumb when there\xe2\x80\x99s a neighbor around. If I\xe2\x80\x99d a\r\nstruck for home and forgot that little detail\xe2\x80\x94However, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstriking for home. I was breaking for any place where I could get away\r\nfrom these fellows that are after me; then I was going to put on this\r\ndisguise and get some different clothes, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe jumped for the outside door and laid his ear against it and\r\nlistened, pale and kind of panting. Presently he whispers:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSounded like cocking a gun! Lord, what a life to lead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sounded like a cocking gun!]\r\n\r\n\r\nThen he sunk down in a chair all limp and sick like, and wiped the\r\nsweat off of his face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nA DIAMOND ROBBERY\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom that time out, we was with him \xe2\x80\x99most all the time, and one or\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99other of us slept in his upper berth. He said he had been so\r\nlonesome, and it was such a comfort to him to have company, and\r\nsomebody to talk to in his troubles. We was in a sweat to find out what\r\nhis secret was, but Tom said the best way was not to seem anxious, then\r\nlikely he would drop into it himself in one of his talks, but if we got\r\nto asking questions he would get suspicious and shet up his shell. It\r\nturned out just so. It warn\xe2\x80\x99t no trouble to see that he _wanted_ to\r\ntalk about it, but always along at first he would scare away from it\r\nwhen he got on the very edge of it, and go to talking about something\r\nelse. The way it come about was this: He got to asking us, kind of\r\nindifferent like, about the passengers down on deck. We told him about\r\nthem. But he warn\xe2\x80\x99t satisfied; we warn\xe2\x80\x99t particular enough. He told us\r\nto describe them better. Tom done it. At last, when Tom was describing\r\none of the roughest and raggedest ones, he gave a shiver and a gasp and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, lordy, that\xe2\x80\x99s one of them! They\xe2\x80\x99re aboard sure\xe2\x80\x94I just knowed it. I\r\nsort of hoped I had got away, but I never believed it. Go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPresently when Tom was describing another mangy, rough deck passenger,\r\nhe give that shiver again and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s him!\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the other one. If it would only come a good black\r\nstormy night and I could get ashore. You see, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got spies on me.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ve got a right to come up and buy drinks at the bar yonder\r\nforrard, and they take that chance to bribe somebody to keep watch on\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94porter or boots or somebody. If I was to slip ashore without anybody\r\nseeing me, they would know it inside of an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo then he got to wandering along, and pretty soon, sure enough, he was\r\ntelling! He was poking along through his ups and downs, and when he\r\ncome to that place he went right along. He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a confidence game. We played it on a julery-shop in St. Louis.\r\nWhat we was after was a couple of noble big di\xe2\x80\x99monds as big as\r\nhazel-nuts, which everybody was running to see. We was dressed up fine,\r\nand we played it on them in broad daylight. We ordered the di\xe2\x80\x99monds\r\nsent to the hotel for us to see if we wanted to buy, and when we was\r\nexamining them we had paste counterfeits all ready, and _them_ was the\r\nthings that went back to the shop when we said the water wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite\r\nfine enough for twelve thousand dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwelve-thousand-dollars!\xe2\x80\x9d Tom says. \xe2\x80\x9cWas they really worth all that\r\nmoney, do you reckon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery cent of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you fellows got away with them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs easy as nothing. I don\xe2\x80\x99t reckon the julery people know they\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nrobbed yet. But it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be good sense to stay around St. Louis, of\r\ncourse, so we considered where we\xe2\x80\x99d go. One was for going one way, one\r\nanother, so we throwed up, heads or tails, and the Upper Mississippi\r\nwon. We done up the di\xe2\x80\x99monds in a paper and put our names on it and put\r\nit in the keep of the hotel clerk, and told him not to ever let either\r\nof us have it again without the others was on hand to see it done; then\r\nwe went down town, each by his own self\xe2\x80\x94because I reckon maybe we all\r\nhad the same notion. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know for certain, but I reckon maybe we\r\nhad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat notion?\xe2\x80\x9d Tom says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo rob the others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94one take everything, after all of you had helped to get it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCert\xe2\x80\x99nly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt disgusted Tom Sawyer, and he said it was the orneriest, low-downest\r\nthing he ever heard of. But Jake Dunlap said it warn\xe2\x80\x99t unusual in the\r\nprofession. Said when a person was in that line of business he\xe2\x80\x99d got to\r\nlook out for his own intrust, there warn\xe2\x80\x99t nobody else going to do it\r\nfor him. And then he went on. He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, the trouble was, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t divide up two di\xe2\x80\x99monds amongst\r\nthree. If there\xe2\x80\x99d been three\xe2\x80\x94But never mind about that, there warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthree. I loafed along the back streets studying and studying. And I\r\nsays to myself, I\xe2\x80\x99ll hog them di\xe2\x80\x99monds the first chance I get, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave a disguise all ready, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll give the boys the slip, and when\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m safe away I\xe2\x80\x99ll put it on, and then let them find me if they can. So\r\nI got the false whiskers and the goggles and this countrified suit of\r\nclothes, and fetched them along back in a hand-bag; and when I was\r\npassing a shop where they sell all sorts of things, I got a glimpse of\r\none of my pals through the window. It was Bud Dixon. I was glad, you\r\nbet. I says to myself, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see what he buys. So I kept shady, and\r\nwatched. Now what do you reckon it was he bought?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhiskers?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoggles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, keep still, Huck Finn, can\xe2\x80\x99t you, you\xe2\x80\x99re only just hendering all\r\nyou can. What _was_ it he bought, Jake?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d never guess in the world. It was only just a screwdriver\xe2\x80\x94just a\r\nwee little bit of a screwdriver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I declare! What did he want with that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I thought. It was curious. It clean stumped me. I says to\r\nmyself, what can he want with that thing? Well, when he come out I\r\nstood back out of sight, and then tracked him to a second-hand\r\nslop-shop and see him buy a red flannel shirt and some old ragged\r\nclothes\xe2\x80\x94just the ones he\xe2\x80\x99s got on now, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve described. Then I went\r\ndown to the wharf and hid my things aboard the up-river boat that we\r\nhad picked out, and then started back and had another streak of luck. I\r\nseen our other pal lay in _his_ stock of old rusty second-handers. We\r\ngot the di\xe2\x80\x99monds and went aboard the boat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut now we was up a stump, for we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go to bed. We had to set up\r\nand watch one another. Pity, that was; pity to put that kind of a\r\nstrain on us, because there was bad blood between us from a couple of\r\nweeks back, and we was only friends in the way of business. Bad anyway,\r\nseeing there was only two di\xe2\x80\x99monds betwixt three men. First we had\r\nsupper, and then tramped up and down the deck together smoking till\r\nmost midnight; then we went and set down in my stateroom and locked the\r\ndoors and looked in the piece of paper to see if the di\xe2\x80\x99monds was all\r\nright, then laid it on the lower berth right in full sight; and there\r\nwe set, and set, and by-and-by it got to be dreadful hard to keep\r\nawake. At last Bud Dixon he dropped off. As soon as he was snoring a\r\ngood regular gait that was likely to last, and had his chin on his\r\nbreast and looked permanent, Hal Clayton nodded towards the di\xe2\x80\x99monds\r\nand then towards the outside door, and I understood. I reached and got\r\nthe paper, and then we stood up and waited perfectly still; Bud never\r\nstirred; I turned the key of the outside door very soft and slow, then\r\nturned the knob the same way, and we went tiptoeing out onto the guard,\r\nand shut the door very soft and gentle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: We stood up and waited perfectly still.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere warn\xe2\x80\x99t nobody stirring anywhere, and the boat was slipping\r\nalong, swift and steady, through the big water in the smoky moonlight.\r\nWe never said a word, but went straight up onto the hurricane-deck and\r\nplumb back aft, and set down on the end of the sky-light. Both of us\r\nknowed what that meant, without having to explain to one another. Bud\r\nDixon would wake up and miss the swag, and would come straight for us,\r\nfor he ain\xe2\x80\x99t afeard of anything or anybody, that man ain\xe2\x80\x99t. He would\r\ncome, and we would heave him overboard, or get killed trying. It made\r\nme shiver, because I ain\xe2\x80\x99t as brave as some people, but if I showed the\r\nwhite feather\xe2\x80\x94well, I knowed better than do that. I kind of hoped the\r\nboat would land somers, and we could skip ashore and not have to run\r\nthe risk of this row, I was so scared of Bud Dixon, but she was an\r\nupper-river tub and there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no real chance of that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the time strung along and along, and that fellow never come!\r\nWhy, it strung along till dawn begun to break, and still he never come.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thunder,\xe2\x80\x99 I says, \xe2\x80\x98what do you make out of this?\xe2\x80\x94ain\xe2\x80\x99t it suspicious?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Land!\xe2\x80\x99 Hal says, \xe2\x80\x98do you reckon he\xe2\x80\x99s playing us?\xe2\x80\x94open the paper!\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\ndone it, and by gracious there warn\xe2\x80\x99t anything in it but a couple of\r\nlittle pieces of loaf-sugar! _that\xe2\x80\x99s_ the reason he could set there and\r\nsnooze all night so comfortable. Smart? Well, I reckon! He had had them\r\ntwo papers all fixed and ready, and he had put one of them in place of\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99other right under our noses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe felt pretty cheap. But the thing to do, straight off, was to make a\r\nplan; and we done it. We would do up the paper again, just as it was,\r\nand slip in, very elaborate and soft, and lay it on the bunk again, and\r\nlet on _we_ didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about any trick, and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t any idea he was\r\na-laughing at us behind them bogus snores of his\xe2\x80\x99n; and we would stick\r\nby him, and the first night we was ashore we would get him drunk and\r\nsearch him, and get the di\xe2\x80\x99monds; and _do_ for him, too, if it warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntoo risky. If we got the swag, we\xe2\x80\x99d _got_ to do for him, or he would\r\nhunt us down and do for us, sure. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have no real hope. I\r\nknowed we could get him drunk\xe2\x80\x94he was always ready for that\xe2\x80\x94but what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe good of it? You might search him a year and never find\xe2\x80\x94Well, right\r\nthere I catched my breath and broke off my thought! For an idea went\r\nripping through my head that tore my brains to rags\xe2\x80\x94and land, but I\r\nfelt gay and good! You see, I had had my boots off, to unswell my feet,\r\nand just then I took up one of them to put it on, and I catched a\r\nglimpse of the heel-bottom, and it just took my breath away. You\r\nremember about that puzzlesome little screwdriver?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet I do,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tom, all excited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, when I catched that glimpse of that boot heel, the idea that\r\nwent smashing through my head was, I know where he\xe2\x80\x99s hid the di\xe2\x80\x99monds!\r\nYou look at this boot heel, now. See, it\xe2\x80\x99s bottomed with a steel plate,\r\nand the plate is fastened on with little screws. Now there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nscrew about that feller anywhere but in his boot heels; so, if he\r\nneeded a screwdriver, I reckoned I knowed why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuck, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it bully!\xe2\x80\x9d says Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I got my boots on, and we went down and slipped in and laid the\r\npaper of sugar on the berth, and sat down soft and sheepish and went to\r\nlistening to Bud Dixon snore. Hal Clayton dropped off pretty soon, but\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t; I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ever so wide awake in my life. I was spying out from\r\nunder the shade of my hat brim, searching the floor for leather. It\r\ntook me a long time, and I begun to think maybe my guess was wrong, but\r\nat last I struck it. It laid over by the bulkhead, and was nearly the\r\ncolor of the carpet. It was a little round plug about as thick as the\r\nend of your little finger, and I says to myself there\xe2\x80\x99s a di\xe2\x80\x99mond in\r\nthe nest you\xe2\x80\x99ve come from. Before long I spied out the plug\xe2\x80\x99s mate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink of the smartness and coolness of that blatherskite! He put up\r\nthat scheme on us and reasoned out what we would do, and we went ahead\r\nand done it perfectly exact, like a couple of pudd\xe2\x80\x99nheads. He set there\r\nand took his own time to unscrew his heelplates and cut out his plugs\r\nand stick in the di\xe2\x80\x99monds and screw on his plates again. He allowed we\r\nwould steal the bogus swag and wait all night for him to come up and\r\nget drownded, and by George it\xe2\x80\x99s just what we done! I think it was\r\npowerful smart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet your life it was!\xe2\x80\x9d says Tom, just full of admiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nTHE THREE SLEEPERS\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, all day we went through the humbug of watching one another, and\r\nit was pretty sickly business for two of us and hard to act out, I can\r\ntell you. About night we landed at one of them little Missouri towns\r\nhigh up toward Iowa, and had supper at the tavern, and got a room\r\nupstairs with a cot and a double bed in it, but I dumped my bag under a\r\ndeal table in the dark hall while we was moving along it to bed, single\r\nfile, me last, and the landlord in the lead with a tallow candle. We\r\nhad up a lot of whisky, and went to playing high-low-jack for dimes,\r\nand as soon as the whisky begun to take hold of Bud we stopped\r\ndrinking, but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t let him stop. We loaded him till he fell out of\r\nhis chair and laid there snoring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe was ready for business now. I said we better pull our boots off,\r\nand his\xe2\x80\x99n too, and not make any noise, then we could pull him and haul\r\nhim around and ransack him without any trouble. So we done it. I set my\r\nboots and Bud\xe2\x80\x99s side by side, where they\xe2\x80\x99d be handy. Then we stripped\r\nhim and searched his seams and his pockets and his socks and the inside\r\nof his boots, and everything, and searched his bundle. Never found any\r\ndi\xe2\x80\x99monds. We found the screwdriver, and Hal says, \xe2\x80\x98What do you reckon\r\nhe wanted with that?\xe2\x80\x99 I said I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know; but when he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t looking\r\nI hooked it. At last Hal he looked beat and discouraged, and said we\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ngot to give it up. That was what I was waiting for. I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s one place we hain\xe2\x80\x99t searched.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What place is that?\xe2\x80\x99 he says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98His stomach.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98By gracious, I never thought of that! _Now_ we\xe2\x80\x99re on the homestretch,\r\nto a dead moral certainty. How\xe2\x80\x99ll we manage?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 I says, \xe2\x80\x98just stay by him till I turn out and hunt up a drug\r\nstore, and I reckon I\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch something that\xe2\x80\x99ll make them di\xe2\x80\x99monds\r\ntired of the company they\xe2\x80\x99re keeping.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said that\xe2\x80\x99s the ticket, and with him looking straight at me I slid\r\nmyself into Bud\xe2\x80\x99s boots instead of my own, and he never noticed. They\r\nwas just a shade large for me, but that was considerable better than\r\nbeing too small. I got my bag as I went a-groping through the hall, and\r\nin about a minute I was out the back way and stretching up the river\r\nroad at a five-mile gait.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not feeling so very bad, neither\xe2\x80\x94walking on di\xe2\x80\x99monds don\xe2\x80\x99t have no\r\nsuch effect. When I had gone fifteen minutes I says to myself, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x99n a mile behind me, and everything quiet. Another five minutes and\r\nI says there\xe2\x80\x99s considerable more land behind me now, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a man\r\nback there that\xe2\x80\x99s begun to wonder what\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble. Another five and\r\nI says to myself he\xe2\x80\x99s getting real uneasy\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s walking the floor now.\r\nAnother five, and I says to myself, there\xe2\x80\x99s two mile and a half behind\r\nme, and he\xe2\x80\x99s _awful_ uneasy\xe2\x80\x94beginning to cuss, I reckon. Pretty soon I\r\nsays to myself, forty minutes gone\xe2\x80\x94he _knows_ there\xe2\x80\x99s something up!\r\nFifty minutes\xe2\x80\x94the truth\xe2\x80\x99s a-busting on him now! he is reckoning I found\r\nthe di\xe2\x80\x99monds whilst we was searching, and shoved them in my pocket and\r\nnever let on\xe2\x80\x94yes, and he\xe2\x80\x99s starting out to hunt for me. He\xe2\x80\x99ll hunt for\r\nnew tracks in the dust, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll as likely send him down the river\r\nas up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust then I see a man coming down on a mule, and before I thought I\r\njumped into the bush. It was stupid! When he got abreast he stopped and\r\nwaited a little for me to come out; then he rode on again. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfeel gay any more. I says to myself I\xe2\x80\x99ve botched my chances by that; I\r\nsurely have, if he meets up with Hal Clayton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, about three in the morning I fetched Elexandria and see this\r\nstern-wheeler laying there, and was very glad, because I felt perfectly\r\nsafe, now, you know. It was just daybreak. I went aboard and got this\r\nstateroom and put on these clothes and went up in the pilot-house\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nwatch, though I didn\xe2\x80\x99t reckon there was any need of it. I set there and\r\nplayed with my di\xe2\x80\x99monds and waited and waited for the boat to start,\r\nbut she didn\xe2\x80\x99t. You see, they was mending her machinery, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow anything about it, not being very much used to steamboats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Walked ashore.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to cut the tale short, we never left there till plumb noon; and\r\nlong before that I was hid in this stateroom; for before breakfast I\r\nsee a man coming, away off, that had a gait like Hal Clayton\xe2\x80\x99s, and it\r\nmade me just sick. I says to myself, if he finds out I\xe2\x80\x99m aboard this\r\nboat, he\xe2\x80\x99s got me like a rat in a trap. All he\xe2\x80\x99s got to do is to have\r\nme watched, and wait\xe2\x80\x94wait till I slip ashore, thinking he is a thousand\r\nmiles away, then slip after me and dog me to a good place and make me\r\ngive up the di\xe2\x80\x99monds, and then he\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\x94oh, I know what he\xe2\x80\x99ll do! Ain\xe2\x80\x99t it\r\nawful\xe2\x80\x94awful! And now to think the _other_ one\xe2\x80\x99s aboard, too! Oh, ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit hard luck, boys\xe2\x80\x94ain\xe2\x80\x99t it hard! But you\xe2\x80\x99ll help save me, _won\xe2\x80\x99t_\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x94oh, boys, be good to a poor devil that\xe2\x80\x99s being hunted to death,\r\nand save me\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll worship the very ground you walk on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe turned in and soothed him down and told him we would plan for him\r\nand help him, and he needn\xe2\x80\x99t be so afeard; and so by and by he got to\r\nfeeling kind of comfortable again, and unscrewed his heelplates and\r\nheld up his di\xe2\x80\x99monds this way and that, admiring them and loving them;\r\nand when the light struck into them they _was_ beautiful, sure; why,\r\nthey seemed to kind of bust, and snap fire out all around. But all the\r\nsame I judged he was a fool. If I had been him I would a handed the\r\ndi\xe2\x80\x99monds to them pals and got them to go ashore and leave me alone. But\r\nhe was made different. He said it was a whole fortune and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbear the idea.\r\n\r\nTwice we stopped to fix the machinery and laid a good while, once in\r\nthe night; but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t dark enough, and he was afeard to skip. But\r\nthe third time we had to fix it there was a better chance. We laid up\r\nat a country woodyard about forty mile above Uncle Silas\xe2\x80\x99s place a\r\nlittle after one at night, and it was thickening up and going to storm.\r\nSo Jake he laid for a chance to slide. We begun to take in wood. Pretty\r\nsoon the rain come a-drenching down, and the wind blowed hard. Of\r\ncourse every boat-hand fixed a gunny sack and put it on like a bonnet,\r\nthe way they do when they are toting wood, and we got one for Jake, and\r\nhe slipped down aft with his hand-bag and come tramping forrard just\r\nlike the rest, and walked ashore with them, and when we see him pass\r\nout of the light of the torch-basket and get swallowed up in the dark,\r\nwe got our breath again and just felt grateful and splendid. But it\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t for long. Somebody told, I reckon; for in about eight or ten\r\nminutes them two pals come tearing forrard as tight as they could jump\r\nand darted ashore and was gone. We waited plumb till dawn for them to\r\ncome back, and kept hoping they would, but they never did. We was awful\r\nsorry and low-spirited. All the hope we had was that Jake had got such\r\na start that they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get on his track, and he would get to his\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s and hide there and be safe.\r\n\r\nHe was going to take the river road, and told us to find out if Brace\r\nand Jubiter was to home and no strangers there, and then slip out about\r\nsundown and tell him. Said he would wait for us in a little bunch of\r\nsycamores right back of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s uncle Silas\xe2\x80\x99s tobacker field on the river\r\nroad, a lonesome place.\r\n\r\nWe set and talked a long time about his chances, and Tom said he was\r\nall right if the pals struck up the river instead of down, but it\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t likely, because maybe they knowed where he was from; more likely\r\nthey would go right, and dog him all day, him not suspecting, and kill\r\nhim when it come dark, and take the boots. So we was pretty sorrowful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nA TRAGEDY IN THE WOODS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t get done tinkering the machinery till away late in the\r\nafternoon, and so it was so close to sundown when we got home that we\r\nnever stopped on our road, but made a break for the sycamores as tight\r\nas we could go, to tell Jake what the delay was, and have him wait till\r\nwe could go to Brace\xe2\x80\x99s and find out how things was there. It was\r\ngetting pretty dim by the time we turned the corner of the woods,\r\nsweating and panting with that long run, and see the sycamores thirty\r\nyards ahead of us; and just then we see a couple of men run into the\r\nbunch and heard two or three terrible screams for help. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Jake is\r\nkilled, sure,\xe2\x80\x9d we says. We was scared through and through, and broke\r\nfor the tobacker field and hid there, trembling so our clothes would\r\nhardly stay on; and just as we skipped in there, a couple of men went\r\ntearing by, and into the bunch they went, and in a second out jumps\r\nfour men and took out up the road as tight as they could go, two\r\nchasing two.\r\n\r\nWe laid down, kind of weak and sick, and listened for more sounds, but\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t hear none for a good while but just our hearts. We was thinking\r\nof that awful thing laying yonder in the sycamores, and it seemed like\r\nbeing that close to a ghost, and it give me the cold shudders. The moon\r\ncome a-swelling up out of the ground, now, powerful big and round and\r\nbright, behind a comb of trees, like a face looking through prison\r\nbars, and the black shadders and white places begun to creep around,\r\nand it was miserable quiet and still and night-breezy and graveyardy\r\nand scary. All of a sudden Tom whispers:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d I says. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t take a person by surprise that way. I\xe2\x80\x99m \xe2\x80\x99most\r\nready to die, anyway, without you doing that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, I tell you. It\xe2\x80\x99s something coming out of the sycamores.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, Tom!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s terrible tall!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, lordy-lordy! let\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep still\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a-coming this way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was so excited he could hardly get breath enough to whisper. I had\r\nto look. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it. So now we was both on our knees with our\r\nchins on a fence rail and gazing\xe2\x80\x94yes, and gasping too. It was coming\r\ndown the road\xe2\x80\x94coming in the shadder of the trees, and you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nit good; not till it was pretty close to us; then it stepped into a\r\nbright splotch of moonlight and we sunk right down in our tracks\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nJake Dunlap\xe2\x80\x99s ghost! That was what we said to ourselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: It was Jake Dunlap\xe2\x80\x99s ghost.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stir for a minute or two; then it was gone. We talked about\r\nit in low voices. Tom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re mostly dim and smoky, or like they\xe2\x80\x99re made out of fog, but\r\nthis one wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I says; \xe2\x80\x9cI seen the goggles and the whiskers perfectly plain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and the very colors in them loud countrified Sunday clothes\xe2\x80\x94plaid\r\nbreeches, green and black\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCotton velvet westcot, fire-red and yaller squares\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeather straps to the bottoms of the breeches legs and one of them\r\nhanging unbottoned\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and that hat\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a hat for a ghost to wear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYou see it was the first season anybody wore that kind\xe2\x80\x94a black\r\nstiff-brim stove-pipe, very high, and not smooth, with a round top\xe2\x80\x94just\r\nlike a sugar-loaf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you notice if its hair was the same, Huck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94seems to me I did, then again it seems to me I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t either; but it had its bag along, I noticed that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo did I. How can there be a ghost-bag, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSho! I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be as ignorant as that if I was you, Huck Finn.\r\nWhatever a ghost has, turns to ghost-stuff. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have their\r\nthings, like anybody else. You see, yourself, that its clothes was\r\nturned to ghost-stuff. Well, then, what\xe2\x80\x99s to hender its bag from\r\nturning, too? Of course it done it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was reasonable. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find no fault with it. Bill Withers and\r\nhis brother Jack come along by, talking, and Jack says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you reckon he was toting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dunno; but it was pretty heavy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, all he could lug. Nigger stealing corn from old Parson Silas, I\r\njudged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo did I. And so I allowed I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let on to see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s me, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they both laughed, and went on out of hearing. It showed how\r\nunpopular old Uncle Silas had got to be now. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 let a\r\nnigger steal anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s corn and never done anything to him.\r\n\r\nWe heard some more voices mumbling along towards us and getting louder,\r\nand sometimes a cackle of a laugh. It was Lem Beebe and Jim Lane. Jim\r\nLane says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x94Jubiter Dunlap?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I reckon so. I seen him spading up some ground along\r\nabout an hour ago, just before sundown\xe2\x80\x94him and the parson. Said he\r\nguessed he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go to-night, but we could have his dog if we wanted\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo tired, I reckon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94works so hard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you bet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey cackled at that, and went on by. Tom said we better jump out and\r\ntag along after them, because they was going our way and it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\ncomfortable to run across the ghost all by ourselves. So we done it,\r\nand got home all right.\r\n\r\nThat night was the second of September\xe2\x80\x94a Saturday. I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t ever\r\nforget it. You\xe2\x80\x99ll see why, pretty soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nPLANS TO SECURE THE DIAMONDS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe tramped along behind Jim and Lem till we come to the back stile\r\nwhere old Jim\xe2\x80\x99s cabin was that he was captivated in, the time we set\r\nhim free, and here come the dogs piling around us to say howdy, and\r\nthere was the lights of the house, too; so we warn\xe2\x80\x99t afeard any more,\r\nand was going to climb over, but Tom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on; set down here a minute. By George!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatter enough!\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t you expecting we would be the first\r\nto tell the family who it is that\xe2\x80\x99s been killed yonder in the\r\nsycamores, and all about them rapscallions that done it, and about the\r\ndi\xe2\x80\x99monds they\xe2\x80\x99ve smouched off of the corpse, and paint it up fine, and\r\nhave the glory of being the ones that knows a lot more about it than\r\nanybody else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be you, Tom Sawyer, if you was to let such\r\na chance go by. I reckon it ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to suffer none for lack of\r\npaint,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you start in to scollop the facts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, perfectly ca\xe2\x80\x99m, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat would you say if I was to\r\ntell you I ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to start in at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was astonished to hear him talk so. I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s a lie. You ain\xe2\x80\x99t in earnest, Tom Sawyer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll soon see. Was the ghost barefooted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Was the ghost barefooted?]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. What of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wait\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you what. Did it have its boots on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I seen them plain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwear it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I swear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I. Now do you know what that means?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. What does it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeans that them thieves _didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the di\xe2\x80\x99monds_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJimminy! What makes you think that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t only think it, I know it. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t the breeches and goggles and\r\nwhiskers and hand-bag and every blessed thing turn to ghost-stuff?\r\nEverything it had on turned, didn\xe2\x80\x99t it? It shows that the reason its\r\nboots turned too was because it still had them on after it started to\r\ngo ha\xe2\x80\x99nting around, and if that ain\xe2\x80\x99t proof that them blatherskites\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t get the boots, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know what you\xe2\x80\x99d _call_ proof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThink of that now. I never see such a head as that boy had. Why, I had\r\neyes and I could see things, but they never meant nothing to me. But\r\nTom Sawyer was different. When Tom Sawyer seen a thing it just got up\r\non its hind legs and _talked_ to him\xe2\x80\x94told him everything it knowed. I\r\nnever see such a head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom Sawyer,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll say it again as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said it a many a time\r\nbefore: I ain\xe2\x80\x99t fitten to black your boots. But that\xe2\x80\x99s all right\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nneither here nor there. God Almighty made us all, and some He gives\r\neyes that\xe2\x80\x99s blind, and some He gives eyes that can see, and I reckon it\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t none of our lookout what He done it for; it\xe2\x80\x99s all right, or He\xe2\x80\x99d\r\n\xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 fixed it some other way. Go on\xe2\x80\x94I see plenty plain enough, now, that\r\nthem thieves didn\xe2\x80\x99t get way with the di\xe2\x80\x99monds. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t they, do you\r\nreckon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause they got chased away by them other two men before they could\r\npull the boots off of the corpse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so! I see it now. But looky here, Tom, why ain\xe2\x80\x99t we to go and\r\ntell about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, shucks, Huck Finn, can\xe2\x80\x99t you see? Look at it. What\xe2\x80\x99s a-going to\r\nhappen? There\xe2\x80\x99s going to be an inquest in the morning. Them two men\r\nwill tell how they heard the yells and rushed there just in time to not\r\nsave the stranger. Then the jury\xe2\x80\x99ll twaddle and twaddle and twaddle,\r\nand finally they\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch in a verdict that he got shot or stuck or\r\nbusted over the head with something, and come to his death by the\r\ninspiration of God. And after they\xe2\x80\x99ve buried him they\xe2\x80\x99ll auction off\r\nhis things for to pay the expenses, and then\xe2\x80\x99s _our_ chance.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHow,\r\nTom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuy the boots for two dollars!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, it \xe2\x80\x99most took my breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy land! Why, Tom, _we\xe2\x80\x99ll_ get the di\xe2\x80\x99monds!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet. Some day there\xe2\x80\x99ll be a big reward offered for them\xe2\x80\x94a thousand\r\ndollars, sure. That\xe2\x80\x99s our money! Now we\xe2\x80\x99ll trot in and see the folks.\r\nAnd mind you we don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about any murder, or any di\xe2\x80\x99monds,\r\nor any thieves\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you forget that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had to sigh a little over the way he had got it fixed. I\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 _sold_\r\nthem di\xe2\x80\x99monds\xe2\x80\x94yes, sir\xe2\x80\x94for twelve thousand dollars; but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nanything. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t done any good. I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what are we going to tell your aunt Sally has made us so long\r\ngetting down here from the village, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave that to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI reckon you can explain it\r\nsomehow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was always just that strict and delicate. He never would tell a lie\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nWe struck across the big yard, noticing this, that, and t\xe2\x80\x99other thing\r\nthat was so familiar, and we so glad to see it again, and when we got\r\nto the roofed big passageway betwixt the double log house and the\r\nkitchen part, there was everything hanging on the wall just as it used\r\nto was, even to Uncle Silas\xe2\x80\x99s old faded green baize working-gown with\r\nthe hood to it, and raggedy white patch between the shoulders that\r\nalways looked like somebody had hit him with a snowball; and then we\r\nlifted the latch and walked in. Aunt Sally she was just a-ripping and\r\na-tearing around, and the children was huddled in one corner, and the\r\nold man he was huddled in the other and praying for help in time of\r\nneed. She jumped for us with joy and tears running down her face and\r\ngive us a whacking box on the ear, and then hugged us and kissed us and\r\nboxed us again, and just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to get enough of it, she was so\r\nglad to see us; and she says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere _have_ you been a-loafing to, you good-for-nothing trash! I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen that worried about you I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do. Your traps has\r\nbeen here ever so long, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve had supper cooked fresh about four\r\ntimes so as to have it hot and good when you come, till at last my\r\npatience is just plumb wore out, and I declare I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94why I could skin you\r\nalive! You must be starving, poor things!\xe2\x80\x94set down, set down,\r\neverybody; don\xe2\x80\x99t lose no more time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was good to be there again behind all that noble corn-pone and\r\nspareribs, and everything that you could ever want in this world. Old\r\nUncle Silas he peeled off one of his bulliest old-time blessings, with\r\nas many layers to it as an onion, and whilst the angels was hauling in\r\nthe slack of it I was trying to study up what to say about what kept us\r\nso long. When our plates was all loadened and we\xe2\x80\x99d got a-going, she\r\nasked me, and I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see,\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94Mizzes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuck Finn! Since when am I Mizzes to you? Have I ever been stingy of\r\ncuffs or kisses for you since the day you stood in this room and I took\r\nyou for Tom Sawyer and blessed God for sending you to me, though you\r\ntold me four thousand lies and I believed every one of them like a\r\nsimpleton? Call me Aunt Sally\xe2\x80\x94like you always done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo I done it. And I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, me and Tom allowed we would come along afoot and take a smell of\r\nthe woods, and we run across Lem Beebe and Jim Lane, and they asked us\r\nto go with them blackberrying to-night, and said they could borrow\r\nJubiter Dunlap\xe2\x80\x99s dog, because he had told them just that minute\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did they see him?\xe2\x80\x9d says the old man; and when I looked up to see\r\nhow _he_ come to take an intrust in a little thing like that, his eyes\r\nwas just burning into me, he was that eager. It surprised me so it kind\r\nof throwed me off, but I pulled myself together again and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was when he was spading up some ground along with you, towards\r\nsundown or along there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe only said, \xe2\x80\x9cUm,\xe2\x80\x9d in a kind of a disappointed way, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t take no\r\nmore intrust. So I went on. I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, as I was a-saying\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll do, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t go no furder.\xe2\x80\x9d It was Aunt Sally. She was\r\nboring right into me with her eyes, and very indignant. \xe2\x80\x9cHuck Finn,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe says, \xe2\x80\x9chow\xe2\x80\x99d them men come to talk about going a-black-berrying in\r\nSeptember\xe2\x80\x94in _this_ region?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI see I had slipped up, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say a word. She waited, still\r\na-gazing at me, then she says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how\xe2\x80\x99d they come to strike that idiot idea of going a-blackberrying\r\nin the night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, m\xe2\x80\x99m, they\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94they told us they had a lantern, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _shet_ up\xe2\x80\x94do! Looky here; what was they going to do with a\r\ndog?\xe2\x80\x94hunt blackberries with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, m\xe2\x80\x99m, they\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Tom Sawyer, what kind of a lie are you fixing _your_ mouth to\r\ncontribit to this mess of rubbage? Speak out\xe2\x80\x94and I warn you before you\r\nbegin, that I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe a word of it. You and Huck\xe2\x80\x99s been up to\r\nsomething you no business to\xe2\x80\x94I know it perfectly well; I know you,\r\n_both_ of you. Now you explain that dog, and them blackberries, and the\r\nlantern, and the rest of that rot\xe2\x80\x94and mind you talk as straight as a\r\nstring\xe2\x80\x94do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom he looked considerable hurt, and says, very dignified:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a pity if Huck is to be talked to that way, just for making a\r\nlittle bit of a mistake that anybody could make.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat mistake has he made?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, only the mistake of saying blackberries when of course he meant\r\nstrawberries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom Sawyer, I lay if you aggravate me a little more, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt Sally, without knowing it\xe2\x80\x94and of course without intending it\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nare in the wrong. If you\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 studied natural history the way you\r\nought, you would know that all over the world except just here in\r\nArkansaw they _always_ hunt strawberries with a dog\xe2\x80\x94and a lantern\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she busted in on him there and just piled into him and snowed him\r\nunder. She was so mad she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get the words out fast enough, and\r\nshe gushed them out in one everlasting freshet. That was what Tom\r\nSawyer was after. He allowed to work her up and get her started and\r\nthen leave her alone and let her burn herself out. Then she would be so\r\naggravated with that subject that she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say another word about\r\nit, nor let anybody else. Well, it happened just so. When she was\r\ntuckered out and had to hold up, he says, quite ca\xe2\x80\x99m:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, all the same, Aunt Sally\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShet up!\xe2\x80\x9d she says, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear another word out of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo we was perfectly safe, then, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t have no more trouble about\r\nthat delay. Tom done it elegant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nA NIGHT\xe2\x80\x99S VIGIL\r\n\r\n\r\nBenny she was looking pretty sober, and she sighed some, now and then;\r\nbut pretty soon she got to asking about Mary, and Sid, and Tom\xe2\x80\x99s aunt\r\nPolly, and then Aunt Sally\xe2\x80\x99s clouds cleared off and she got in a good\r\nhumor and joined in on the questions and was her lovingest best self,\r\nand so the rest of the supper went along gay and pleasant. But the old\r\nman he didn\xe2\x80\x99t take any hand hardly, and was absent-minded and restless,\r\nand done a considerable amount of sighing; and it was kind of\r\nheart-breaking to see him so sad and troubled and worried.\r\n\r\nBy and by, a spell after supper, come a nigger and knocked on the door\r\nand put his head in with his old straw hat in his hand bowing and\r\nscraping, and said his Marse Brace was out at the stile and wanted his\r\nbrother, and was getting tired waiting supper for him, and would Marse\r\nSilas please tell him where he was? I never see Uncle Silas speak up so\r\nsharp and fractious before. He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I his brother\xe2\x80\x99s keeper?\xe2\x80\x9d And then he kind of wilted together, and\r\nlooked like he wished he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t spoken so, and then he says, very\r\ngentle: \xe2\x80\x9cBut you needn\xe2\x80\x99t say that, Billy; I was took sudden and\r\nirritable, and I ain\xe2\x80\x99t very well these days, and not hardly\r\nresponsible. Tell him he ain\xe2\x80\x99t here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd when the nigger was gone he got up and walked the floor, backwards\r\nand forwards, mumbling and muttering to himself and plowing his hands\r\nthrough his hair. It was real pitiful to see him. Aunt Sally she\r\nwhispered to us and told us not to take notice of him, it embarrassed\r\nhim. She said he was always thinking and thinking, since these troubles\r\ncome on, and she allowed he didn\xe2\x80\x99t more\xe2\x80\x99n about half know what he was\r\nabout when the thinking spells was on him; and she said he walked in\r\nhis sleep considerable more now than he used to, and sometimes wandered\r\naround over the house and even outdoors in his sleep, and if we catched\r\nhim at it we must let him alone and not disturb him. She said she\r\nreckoned it didn\xe2\x80\x99t do him no harm, and may be it done him good. She\r\nsaid Benny was the only one that was much help to him these days. Said\r\nBenny appeared to know just when to try to soothe him and when to leave\r\nhim alone.\r\n\r\nSo he kept on tramping up and down the floor and muttering, till by and\r\nby he begun to look pretty tired; then Benny she went and snuggled up\r\nto his side and put one hand in his and one arm around his waist and\r\nwalked with him; and he smiled down on her, and reached down and kissed\r\nher; and so, little by little the trouble went out of his face and she\r\npersuaded him off to his room. They had very petting ways together, and\r\nit was uncommon pretty to see.\r\n\r\nAunt Sally she was busy getting the children ready for bed; so by and\r\nby it got dull and tedious, and me and Tom took a turn in the\r\nmoonlight, and fetched up in the watermelon-patch and et one, and had a\r\ngood deal of talk. And Tom said he\xe2\x80\x99d bet the quarreling was all\r\nJubiter\xe2\x80\x99s fault, and he was going to be on hand the first time he got a\r\nchance, and see; and if it was so, he was going to do his level best to\r\nget Uncle Silas to turn him off.\r\n\r\nAnd so we talked and smoked and stuffed watermelons much as two hours,\r\nand then it was pretty late, and when we got back the house was quiet\r\nand dark, and everybody gone to bed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Smoked and stuffed watermelon]\r\n\r\n\r\nTom he always seen everything, and now he see that the old green baize\r\nwork-gown was gone, and said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone when he went out; so he\r\nallowed it was curious, and then we went up to bed.\r\n\r\nWe could hear Benny stirring around in her room, which was next to\r\nourn, and judged she was worried a good deal about her father and\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep. We found we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, neither. So we set up a long\r\ntime, and smoked and talked in a low voice, and felt pretty dull and\r\ndown-hearted. We talked the murder and the ghost over and over again,\r\nand got so creepy and crawly we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get sleepy nohow and noway.\r\n\r\nBy and by, when it was away late in the night and all the sounds was\r\nlate sounds and solemn, Tom nudged me and whispers to me to look, and I\r\ndone it, and there we see a man poking around in the yard like he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know just what he wanted to do, but it was pretty dim and we\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see him good. Then he started for the stile, and as he went\r\nover it the moon came out strong, and he had a long-handled shovel over\r\nhis shoulder, and we see the white patch on the old work-gown. So Tom\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a-walking in his sleep. I wish we was allowed to follow him and\r\nsee where he\xe2\x80\x99s going to. There, he\xe2\x80\x99s turned down by the tobacker-field.\r\nOut of sight now. It\xe2\x80\x99s a dreadful pity he can\xe2\x80\x99t rest no better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe waited a long time, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t come back any more, or if he did\r\nhe come around the other way; so at last we was tuckered out and went\r\nto sleep and had nightmares, a million of them. But before dawn we was\r\nawake again, because meantime a storm had come up and been raging, and\r\nthe thunder and lightning was awful, and the wind was a-thrashing the\r\ntrees around, and the rain was driving down in slanting sheets, and the\r\ngullies was running rivers. Tom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLooky here, Huck, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you one thing that\xe2\x80\x99s mighty curious. Up to\r\nthe time we went out last night the family hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard about Jake\r\nDunlap being murdered. Now the men that chased Hal Clayton and Bud\r\nDixon away would spread the thing around in a half an hour, and every\r\nneighbor that heard it would shin out and fly around from one farm to\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99other and try to be the first to tell the news. Land, they don\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nsuch a big thing as that to tell twice in thirty year! Huck, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmighty strange; I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo then he was in a fidget for the rain to let up, so we could turn out\r\nand run across some of the people and see if they would say anything\r\nabout it to us. And he said if they did we must be horribly surprised\r\nand shocked.\r\n\r\nWe was out and gone the minute the rain stopped. It was just broad day\r\nthen. We loafed along up the road, and now and then met a person and\r\nstopped and said howdy, and told them when we come, and how we left the\r\nfolks at home, and how long we was going to stay, and all that, but\r\nnone of them said a word about that thing; which was just astonishing,\r\nand no mistake. Tom said he believed if we went to the sycamores we\r\nwould find that body laying there solitary and alone, and not a soul\r\naround. Said he believed the men chased the thieves so far into the\r\nwoods that the thieves prob\xe2\x80\x99ly seen a good chance and turned on them at\r\nlast, and maybe they all killed each other, and so there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anybody\r\nleft to tell.\r\n\r\nFirst we knowed, gabbling along that away, we was right at the\r\nsycamores. The cold chills trickled down my back and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t budge\r\nanother step, for all Tom\xe2\x80\x99s persuading. But he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold in; he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\n_got_ to see if the boots was safe on that body yet. So he crope in\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthe next minute out he come again with his eyes bulging he was so\r\nexcited, and says:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Huck, it\xe2\x80\x99s gone!]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuck, it\xe2\x80\x99s gone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI _was_ astonished! I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s gone, sure. There ain\xe2\x80\x99t a sign of it. The ground is trampled\r\nsome, but if there was any blood it\xe2\x80\x99s all washed away by the storm, for\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s all puddles and slush in there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last I give in, and went and took a look myself; and it was just as\r\nTom said\xe2\x80\x94there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a sign of a corpse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDern it,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cthe di\xe2\x80\x99monds is gone. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you reckon the thieves\r\nslunk back and lugged him off, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLooks like it. It just does. Now where\xe2\x80\x99d they hide him, do you\r\nreckon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, disgusted, \xe2\x80\x9cand what\xe2\x80\x99s more I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ve got the boots, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all I cared about. He\xe2\x80\x99ll lay around\r\nthese woods a long time before I hunt him up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel no more intrust in him neither, only curiosity to know\r\nwhat come of him; but he said we\xe2\x80\x99d lay low and keep dark and it\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be long till the dogs or somebody rousted him out.\r\n\r\nWe went back home to breakfast ever so bothered and put out and\r\ndisappointed and swindled. I warn\xe2\x80\x99t ever so down on a corpse before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nTALKING WITH THE GHOST\r\n\r\n\r\nIt warn\xe2\x80\x99t very cheerful at breakfast. Aunt Sally she looked old and\r\ntired and let the children snarl and fuss at one another and didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseem to notice it was going on, which wasn\xe2\x80\x99t her usual style; me and\r\nTom had a plenty to think about without talking; Benny she looked like\r\nshe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had much sleep, and whenever she\xe2\x80\x99d lift her head a little\r\nand steal a look towards her father you could see there was tears in\r\nher eyes; and as for the old man, his things stayed on his plate and\r\ngot cold without him knowing they was there, I reckon, for he was\r\nthinking and thinking all the time, and never said a word and never et\r\na bite.\r\n\r\nBy and by when it was stillest, that nigger\xe2\x80\x99s head was poked in at the\r\ndoor again, and he said his Marse Brace was getting powerful uneasy\r\nabout Marse Jubiter, which hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come home yet, and would Marse Silas\r\nplease\xe2\x80\x94He was looking at Uncle Silas, and he stopped there, like the\r\nrest of his words was froze; for Uncle Silas he rose up shaky and\r\nsteadied himself leaning his fingers on the table, and he was panting,\r\nand his eyes was set on the nigger, and he kept swallowing, and put his\r\nother hand up to his throat a couple of times, and at last he got his\r\nwords started, and says:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: What does he think?]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he\xe2\x80\x94does he\xe2\x80\x94think\xe2\x80\x94_what_ does he think! Tell him\xe2\x80\x94tell him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Then\r\nhe sunk down in his chair limp and weak, and says, so as you could\r\nhardly hear him: \xe2\x80\x9cGo away\xe2\x80\x94go away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe nigger looked scared and cleared out, and we all felt\xe2\x80\x94well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how we felt, but it was awful, with the old man panting there, and\r\nhis eyes set and looking like a person that was dying. None of us could\r\nbudge; but Benny she slid around soft, with her tears running down, and\r\nstood by his side, and nestled his old gray head up against her and\r\nbegun to stroke it and pet it with her hands, and nodded to us to go\r\naway, and we done it, going out very quiet, like the dead was there.\r\n\r\nMe and Tom struck out for the woods mighty solemn, and saying how\r\ndifferent it was now to what it was last summer when we was here and\r\neverything was so peaceful and happy and everybody thought so much of\r\nUncle Silas, and he was so cheerful and simple-hearted and\r\npudd\xe2\x80\x99n-headed and good\xe2\x80\x94and now look at him. If he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t lost his mind\r\nhe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much short of it. That was what we allowed.\r\n\r\nIt was a most lovely day now, and bright and sunshiny; and the further\r\nand further we went over the hills towards the prairie the lovelier and\r\nlovelier the trees and flowers got to be and the more it seemed strange\r\nand somehow wrong that there had to be trouble in such a world as this.\r\nAnd then all of a sudden I catched my breath and grabbed Tom\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and\r\nall my livers and lungs and things fell down into my legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is!\xe2\x80\x9d I says. We jumped back behind a bush shivering, and Tom\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Sh!\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t make a noise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was setting on a log right in the edge of a little prairie,\r\nthinking. I tried to get Tom to come away, but he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, and I\r\ndasn\xe2\x80\x99t budge by myself. He said we mightn\xe2\x80\x99t ever get another chance to\r\nsee one, and he was going to look his fill at this one if he died for\r\nit. So I looked too, though it give me the fan-tods to do it. Tom he\r\n_had_ to talk, but he talked low. He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Jakey, it\xe2\x80\x99s got all its things on, just as he said he would.\r\n_Now_ you see what we wasn\xe2\x80\x99t certain about\xe2\x80\x94its hair. It\xe2\x80\x99s not long now\r\nthe way it was: it\xe2\x80\x99s got it cropped close to its head, the way he said\r\nhe would. Huck, I never see anything look any more naturaler than what\r\nIt does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor I neither,\xe2\x80\x9d I says; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d recognize it anywheres.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo would I. It looks perfectly solid and genuwyne, just the way it\r\ndone before it died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo we kept a-gazing. Pretty soon Tom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuck, there\xe2\x80\x99s something mighty curious about this one, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know?\r\nIT oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to be going around in the daytime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so, Tom\xe2\x80\x94I never heard the like of it before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, they don\xe2\x80\x99t ever come out only at night\xe2\x80\x94and then not till\r\nafter twelve. There\xe2\x80\x99s something wrong about this one, now you mark my\r\nwords. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s got any right to be around in the daytime.\r\nBut don\xe2\x80\x99t it look natural! Jake was going to play deef and dumb here,\r\nso the neighbors wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know his voice. Do you reckon it would do\r\nthat if we was to holler at it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLordy, Tom, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk so! If you was to holler at it I\xe2\x80\x99d die in my\r\ntracks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you worry, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to holler at it. Look, Huck, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na-scratching its head\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, this. What\xe2\x80\x99s the sense of it scratching its head? There ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nanything there to itch; its head is made out of fog or something like\r\nthat, and can\xe2\x80\x99t itch. A fog can\xe2\x80\x99t itch; any fool knows that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, if it don\xe2\x80\x99t itch and can\xe2\x80\x99t itch, what in the nation is it\r\nscratching it for? Ain\xe2\x80\x99t it just habit, don\xe2\x80\x99t you reckon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, I don\xe2\x80\x99t. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a bit satisfied about the way this one acts.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve a blame good notion it\xe2\x80\x99s a bogus one\xe2\x80\x94I have, as sure as I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\na-sitting here. Because, if it\xe2\x80\x94Huck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You can\xe2\x80\x99t see the bushes through it!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Tom, it\xe2\x80\x99s so, sure! It\xe2\x80\x99s as solid as a cow. I sort of begin to\r\nthink\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuck, it\xe2\x80\x99s biting off a chaw of tobacker! By George, _they_ don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nchaw\xe2\x80\x94they hain\xe2\x80\x99t got anything to chaw _with_. Huck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a-listening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t a ghost at all. It\xe2\x80\x99s Jake Dunlap his own self!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh your granny!\xe2\x80\x9d I says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuck Finn, did we find any corpse in the sycamores?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr any sign of one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMighty good reason. Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t ever been any corpse there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Tom, you know we heard\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we did\xe2\x80\x94heard a howl or two. Does that prove anybody was killed?\r\nCourse it don\xe2\x80\x99t. And we seen four men run, then this one come walking\r\nout and we took it for a ghost. No more ghost than you are. It was Jake\r\nDunlap his own self, and it\xe2\x80\x99s Jake Dunlap now. He\xe2\x80\x99s been and got his\r\nhair cropped, the way he said he would, and he\xe2\x80\x99s playing himself for a\r\nstranger, just the same as he said he would. Ghost? Hum!\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s as sound\r\nas a nut.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen I see it all, and how we had took too much for granted. I was\r\npowerful glad he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get killed, and so was Tom, and we wondered\r\nwhich he would like the best\xe2\x80\x94for us to never let on to know him, or\r\nhow? Tom reckoned the best way would be to go and ask him. So he\r\nstarted; but I kept a little behind, because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know but it might\r\nbe a ghost, after all. When Tom got to where he was, he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe and Huck\xe2\x80\x99s mighty glad to see you again, and you needn\xe2\x80\x99t be afeared\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll tell. And if you think it\xe2\x80\x99ll be safer for you if we don\xe2\x80\x99t let on\r\nto know you when we run across you, say the word and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see you can\r\ndepend on us, and would ruther cut our hands off than get you into the\r\nleast little bit of danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFirst off he looked surprised to see us, and not very glad, either; but\r\nas Tom went on he looked pleasanter, and when he was done he smiled,\r\nand nodded his head several times, and made signs with his hands, and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Goo-goo\xe2\x80\x94goo-goo]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoo-goo\xe2\x80\x94goo-goo,\xe2\x80\x9d the way deef and dummies does.\r\n\r\nJust then we see some of Steve Nickerson\xe2\x80\x99s people coming that lived\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99other side of the prairie, so Tom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do it elegant; I never see anybody do it better. You\xe2\x80\x99re right;\r\nplay it on us, too; play it on us same as the others; it\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you in\r\npractice and prevent you making blunders. We\xe2\x80\x99ll keep away from you and\r\nlet on we don\xe2\x80\x99t know you, but any time we can be any help, you just let\r\nus know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen we loafed along past the Nickersons, and of course they asked if\r\nthat was the new stranger yonder, and where\xe2\x80\x99d he come from, and what\r\nwas his name, and which communion was he, Babtis\xe2\x80\x99 or Methodis\xe2\x80\x99, and\r\nwhich politics, Whig or Democrat, and how long is he staying, and all\r\nthem other questions that humans always asks when a stranger comes, and\r\nanimals does, too. But Tom said he warn\xe2\x80\x99t able to make anything out of\r\ndeef and dumb signs, and the same with goo-gooing. Then we watched them\r\ngo and bullyrag Jake; because we was pretty uneasy for him. Tom said it\r\nwould take him days to get so he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forget he was a deef and\r\ndummy sometimes, and speak out before he thought. When we had watched\r\nlong enough to see that Jake was getting along all right and working\r\nhis signs very good, we loafed along again, allowing to strike the\r\nschoolhouse about recess time, which was a three-mile tramp.\r\n\r\nI was so disappointed not to hear Jake tell about the row in the\r\nsycamores, and how near he come to getting killed, that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem\r\nto get over it, and Tom he felt the same, but said if we was in Jake\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfix we would want to go careful and keep still and not take any\r\nchances.\r\n\r\nThe boys and girls was all glad to see us again, and we had a real good\r\ntime all through recess. Coming to school the Henderson boys had come\r\nacross the new deef and dummy and told the rest; so all the scholars\r\nwas chuck full of him and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about anything else, and was in\r\na sweat to get a sight of him because they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t ever seen a deef and\r\ndummy in their lives, and it made a powerful excitement.\r\n\r\nTom said it was tough to have to keep mum now; said we would be heroes\r\nif we could come out and tell all we knowed; but after all, it was\r\nstill more heroic to keep mum, there warn\xe2\x80\x99t two boys in a million could\r\ndo it. That was Tom Sawyer\xe2\x80\x99s idea about it, and I reckoned there warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nanybody could better it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nFINDING OF JUBITER DUNLAP\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the next two or three days Dummy he got to be powerful popular. He\r\nwent associating around with the neighbors, and they made much of him,\r\nand was proud to have such a rattling curiosity among them. They had\r\nhim to breakfast, they had him to dinner, they had him to supper; they\r\nkept him loaded up with hog and hominy, and warn\xe2\x80\x99t ever tired staring\r\nat him and wondering over him, and wishing they knowed more about him,\r\nhe was so uncommon and romantic. His signs warn\xe2\x80\x99t no good; people\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand them and he prob\xe2\x80\x99ly couldn\xe2\x80\x99t himself, but he done a\r\nsight of goo-gooing, and so everybody was satisfied, and admired to\r\nhear him go it. He toted a piece of slate around, and a pencil; and\r\npeople wrote questions on it and he wrote answers; but there warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nanybody could read his writing but Brace Dunlap. Brace said he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nread it very good, but he could manage to dig out the meaning most of\r\nthe time. He said Dummy said he belonged away off somers and used to be\r\nwell off, but got busted by swindlers which he had trusted, and was\r\npoor now, and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t any way to make a living.\r\n\r\nEverybody praised Brace Dunlap for being so good to that stranger. He\r\nlet him have a little log-cabin all to himself, and had his niggers\r\ntake care of it, and fetch him all the vittles he wanted.\r\n\r\nDummy was at our house some, because old Uncle Silas was so afflicted\r\nhimself, these days, that anybody else that was afflicted was a comfort\r\nto him. Me and Tom didn\xe2\x80\x99t let on that we had knowed him before, and he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t let on that he had knowed us before. The family talked their\r\ntroubles out before him the same as if he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there, but we reckoned\r\nit wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any harm for him to hear what they said. Generly he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseem to notice, but sometimes he did.\r\n\r\nWell, two or three days went along, and everybody got to getting uneasy\r\nabout Jubiter Dunlap. Everybody was asking everybody if they had any\r\nidea what had become of him. No, they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t, they said: and they shook\r\ntheir heads and said there was something powerful strange about it.\r\nAnother and another day went by; then there was a report got around\r\nthat praps he was murdered. You bet it made a big stir! Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntongue was clacking away after that. Saturday two or three gangs turned\r\nout and hunted the woods to see if they could run across his\r\nremainders. Me and Tom helped, and it was noble good times and\r\nexciting. Tom he was so brimful of it he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat nor rest. He said\r\nif we could find that corpse we would be celebrated, and more talked\r\nabout than if we got drownded.\r\n\r\nThe others got tired and give it up; but not Tom Sawyer\xe2\x80\x94that warn\xe2\x80\x99t his\r\nstyle. Saturday night he didn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep any, hardly, trying to think up a\r\nplan; and towards daylight in the morning he struck it. He snaked me\r\nout of bed and was all excited, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick, Huck, snatch on your clothes\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it! Bloodhound!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn two minutes we was tearing up the river road in the dark towards the\r\nvillage. Old Jeff Hooker had a bloodhound, and Tom was going to borrow\r\nhim. I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe trail\xe2\x80\x99s too old, Tom\xe2\x80\x94and besides, it\xe2\x80\x99s rained, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt don\xe2\x80\x99t make any difference, Huck. If the body\xe2\x80\x99s hid in the woods\r\nanywhere around the hound will find it. If he\xe2\x80\x99s been murdered and\r\nburied, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bury him deep, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t likely, and if the dog\r\ngoes over the spot he\xe2\x80\x99ll scent him, sure. Huck, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be\r\ncelebrated, sure as you\xe2\x80\x99re born!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was just a-blazing; and whenever he got afire he was most likely to\r\nget afire all over. That was the way this time. In two minutes he had\r\ngot it all ciphered out, and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t only just going to find the\r\ncorpse\xe2\x80\x94no, he was going to get on the track of that murderer and hunt\r\n_him_ down, too; and not only that, but he was going to stick to him\r\ntill\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cyou better find the corpse first; I reckon that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na-plenty for to-day. For all we know, there _ain\xe2\x80\x99t_ any corpse and\r\nnobody hain\xe2\x80\x99t been murdered. That cuss could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 gone off somers and\r\nnot been killed at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat graveled him, and he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuck Finn, I never see such a person as you to want to spoil\r\neverything. As long as _you_ can\xe2\x80\x99t see anything hopeful in a thing, you\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t let anybody else. What good can it do you to throw cold water on\r\nthat corpse and get up that selfish theory that there ain\xe2\x80\x99t been any\r\nmurder? None in the world. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how you can act so. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntreat you like that, and you know it. Here we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a noble good\r\nopportunity to make a ruputation, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, go ahead,\xe2\x80\x9d I says. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, and I take it all back. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmean nothing. Fix it any way you want it. _He_ ain\xe2\x80\x99t any consequence to\r\nme. If he\xe2\x80\x99s killed, I\xe2\x80\x99m as glad of it as you are; and if he\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never said anything about being glad; I only\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I\xe2\x80\x99m as _sorry_ as you are. Any way you druther have it,\r\nthat is the way I druther have it. He\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere ain\xe2\x80\x99t any druthers _about_ it, Huck Finn; nobody said anything\r\nabout druthers. And as for\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe forgot he was talking, and went tramping along, studying. He begun\r\nto get excited again, and pretty soon he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuck, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be the bulliest thing that ever happened if we find the\r\nbody after everybody else has quit looking, and then go ahead and hunt\r\nup the murderer. It won\xe2\x80\x99t only be an honor to us, but it\xe2\x80\x99ll be an honor\r\nto Uncle Silas because it was us that done it. It\xe2\x80\x99ll set him up again,\r\nyou see if it don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Old Jeff Hooker he throwed cold water on the whole business when we\r\ngot to his blacksmith shop and told him what we come for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can take the dog,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-going to find any\r\ncorpse, because there ain\xe2\x80\x99t any corpse to find. Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s quit\r\nlooking, and they\xe2\x80\x99re right. Soon as they come to think, they knowed\r\nthere warn\xe2\x80\x99t no corpse. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you for why. What does a person\r\nkill another person for, Tom Sawyer?\xe2\x80\x94answer me that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnswer up! You ain\xe2\x80\x99t no fool. What does he kill him _for?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s for revenge, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait. One thing at a time. Revenge, says you; and right you are. Now\r\nwho ever had anything agin that poor trifling no-account? Who do you\r\nreckon would want to kill _him?_\xe2\x80\x94that rabbit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom was stuck. I reckon he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought of a person having to have a\r\n_reason_ for killing a person before, and now he sees it warn\xe2\x80\x99t likely\r\nanybody would have that much of a grudge against a lamb like Jubiter\r\nDunlap. The blacksmith says, by and by:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe revenge idea won\xe2\x80\x99t work, you see. Well, then, what\xe2\x80\x99s next?\r\nRobbery? B\xe2\x80\x99gosh, that must \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been it, Tom! Yes, sirree, I reckon\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve struck it this time. Some feller wanted his gallus-buckles, and\r\nso he\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it was so funny he busted out laughing, and just went on laughing\r\nand laughing and laughing till he was \xe2\x80\x99most dead, and Tom looked so put\r\nout and cheap that I knowed he was ashamed he had come, and he wished\r\nhe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t. But old Hooker never let up on him. He raked up everything a\r\nperson ever could want to kill another person about, and any fool could\r\nsee they didn\xe2\x80\x99t any of them fit this case, and he just made no end of\r\nfun of the whole business and of the people that had been hunting the\r\nbody; and he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they\xe2\x80\x99d had any sense they\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 knowed the lazy cuss slid out\r\nbecause he wanted a loafing spell after all this work. He\xe2\x80\x99ll come\r\npottering back in a couple of weeks, and then how\xe2\x80\x99ll you fellers feel?\r\nBut, laws bless you, take the dog, and go and hunt his remainders. Do,\r\nTom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he busted out, and had another of them forty-rod laughs of hisn.\r\nTom couldn\xe2\x80\x99t back down after all this, so he said, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, unchain\r\nhim;\xe2\x80\x9d and the blacksmith done it, and we started home and left that old\r\nman laughing yet.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely dog. There ain\xe2\x80\x99t any dog that\xe2\x80\x99s got a lovelier\r\ndisposition than a bloodhound, and this one knowed us and liked us. He\r\ncapered and raced around ever so friendly, and powerful glad to be free\r\nand have a holiday; but Tom was so cut up he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take any intrust\r\nin him, and said he wished he\xe2\x80\x99d stopped and thought a minute before he\r\never started on such a fool errand. He said old Jeff Hooker would tell\r\neverybody, and we\xe2\x80\x99d never hear the last of it.\r\n\r\nSo we loafed along home down the back lanes, feeling pretty glum and\r\nnot talking. When we was passing the far corner of our tobacker field\r\nwe heard the dog set up a long howl in there, and we went to the place\r\nand he was scratching the ground with all his might, and every now and\r\nthen canting up his head sideways and fetching another howl.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fetching another howl.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a long square, the shape of a grave; the rain had made it sink\r\ndown and show the shape. The minute we come and stood there we looked\r\nat one another and never said a word. When the dog had dug down only a\r\nfew inches he grabbed something and pulled it up, and it was an arm and\r\na sleeve. Tom kind of gasped out, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome away, Huck\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s found.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI just felt awful. We struck for the road and fetched the first men\r\nthat come along. They got a spade at the crib and dug out the body, and\r\nyou never see such an excitement. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make anything out of the\r\nface, but you didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to. Everybody said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Jubiter; it\xe2\x80\x99s his clothes, to the last rag!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome rushed off to spread the news and tell the justice of the peace\r\nand have an inquest, and me and Tom lit out for the house. Tom was all\r\nafire and \xe2\x80\x99most out of breath when we come tearing in where Uncle Silas\r\nand Aunt Sally and Benny was. Tom sung out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe and Huck\xe2\x80\x99s found Jubiter Dunlap\xe2\x80\x99s corpse all by ourselves with a\r\nbloodhound, after everybody else had quit hunting and given it up; and\r\nif it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a been for us it never _would_ \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been found; and he\r\n_was_ murdered too\xe2\x80\x94they done it with a club or something like that; and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m going to start in and find the murderer, next, and I bet I\xe2\x80\x99ll do\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAunt Sally and Benny sprung up pale and astonished, but Uncle Silas\r\nfell right forward out of his chair on to the floor and groans out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God, you\xe2\x80\x99ve found him _Now!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nTHE ARREST OF UNCLE SILAS\r\n\r\n\r\nThem awful words froze us solid. We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t move hand or foot for as\r\nmuch as half a minute. Then we kind of come to, and lifted the old man\r\nup and got him into his chair, and Benny petted him and kissed him and\r\ntried to comfort him, and poor old Aunt Sally she done the same; but,\r\npoor things, they was so broke up and scared and knocked out of their\r\nright minds that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly know what they was about. With Tom\r\nit was awful; it \xe2\x80\x99most petrified him to think maybe he had got his\r\nuncle into a thousand times more trouble than ever, and maybe it\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever happened if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been so ambitious to get\r\ncelebrated, and let the corpse alone the way the others done. But\r\npretty soon he sort of come to himself again and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle Silas, don\xe2\x80\x99t you say another word like that. It\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous, and\r\nthere ain\xe2\x80\x99t a shadder of truth in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAunt Sally and Benny was thankful to hear him say that, and they said\r\nthe same; but the old man he wagged his head sorrowful and hopeless,\r\nand the tears run down his face, and he says;\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I done it; poor Jubiter, I done it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was dreadful to hear him say it. Then he went on and told about it,\r\nand said it happened the day me and Tom come\xe2\x80\x94along about sundown. He\r\nsaid Jubiter pestered him and aggravated him till he was so mad he just\r\nsort of lost his mind and grabbed up a stick and hit him over the head\r\nwith all his might, and Jubiter dropped in his tracks. Then he was\r\nscared and sorry, and got down on his knees and lifted his head up, and\r\nbegged him to speak and say he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t dead; and before long he come to,\r\nand when he see who it was holding his head, he jumped like he was\r\n\xe2\x80\x99most scared to death, and cleared the fence and tore into the woods,\r\nand was gone. So he hoped he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt bad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut laws,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cit was only just fear that gave him that last\r\nlittle spurt of strength, and of course it soon played out and he laid\r\ndown in the bush, and there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anybody to help him, and he died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the old man cried and grieved, and said he was a murderer and the\r\nmark of Cain was on him, and he had disgraced his family and was going\r\nto be found out and hung. But Tom said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to be found out. You _didn\xe2\x80\x99t_ kill him. _One_ lick\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t kill him. Somebody else done it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cI done it\xe2\x80\x94nobody else. Who else had anything\r\nagainst him? Who else _could_ have anything against him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked up kind of like he hoped some of us could mention somebody\r\nthat could have a grudge against that harmless no-account, but of\r\ncourse it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use\xe2\x80\x94he _had_ us; we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say a word. He noticed\r\nthat, and he saddened down again, and I never see a face so miserable\r\nand so pitiful to see. Tom had a sudden idea, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut hold on!\xe2\x80\x94somebody _buried_ him. Now who\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shut off sudden. I knowed the reason. It give me the cold shudders\r\nwhen he said them words, because right away I remembered about us\r\nseeing Uncle Silas prowling around with a long-handled shovel away in\r\nthe night that night. And I knowed Benny seen him, too, because she was\r\ntalking about it one day. The minute Tom shut off he changed the\r\nsubject and went to begging Uncle Silas to keep mum, and the rest of us\r\ndone the same, and said he _must_, and said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t his business to\r\ntell on himself, and if he kept mum nobody would ever know; but if it\r\nwas found out and any harm come to him it would break the family\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhearts and kill them, and yet never do anybody any good. So at last he\r\npromised. We was all of us more comfortable, then, and went to work to\r\ncheer up the old man. We told him all he\xe2\x80\x99d got to do was to keep still,\r\nand it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be long till the whole thing would blow over and be\r\nforgot. We all said there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t anybody ever suspect Uncle Silas,\r\nnor ever dream of such a thing, he being so good and kind, and having\r\nsuch a good character; and Tom says, cordial and hearty, he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, just look at it a minute; just consider. Here is Uncle Silas, all\r\nthese years a preacher\xe2\x80\x94at his own expense; all these years doing good\r\nwith all his might and every way he can think of\xe2\x80\x94at his own expense,\r\nall the time; always been loved by everybody, and respected; always\r\nbeen peaceable and minding his own business, the very last man in this\r\nwhole deestrict to touch a person, and everybody knows it. Suspect\r\n_him?_ Why, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t any more possible than\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy authority of the State of Arkansaw, I arrest you for the murder of\r\nJubiter Dunlap!\xe2\x80\x9d shouts the sheriff at the door.\r\n\r\nIt was awful. Aunt Sally and Benny flung themselves at Uncle Silas,\r\nscreaming and crying, and hugged him and hung to him, and Aunt Sally\r\nsaid go away, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever give him up, they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have him,\r\nand the niggers they come crowding and crying to the door and\xe2\x80\x94well, I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand it; it was enough to break a person\xe2\x80\x99s heart; so I got\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThey took him up to the little one-horse jail in the village, and we\r\nall went along to tell him good-bye; and Tom was feeling elegant, and\r\nsays to me, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have a most noble good time and heaps of danger some\r\ndark night getting him out of there, Huck, and it\xe2\x80\x99ll be talked about\r\neverywheres and we will be celebrated;\xe2\x80\x9d but the old man busted that\r\nscheme up the minute he whispered to him about it. He said no, it was\r\nhis duty to stand whatever the law done to him, and he would stick to\r\nthe jail plumb through to the end, even if there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no door to it.\r\nIt disappointed Tom and graveled him a good deal, but he had to put up\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nBut he felt responsible and bound to get his uncle Silas free; and he\r\ntold Aunt Sally, the last thing, not to worry, because he was going to\r\nturn in and work night and day and beat this game and fetch Uncle Silas\r\nout innocent; and she was very loving to him and thanked him and said\r\nshe knowed he would do his very best. And she told us to help Benny\r\ntake care of the house and the children, and then we had a good-bye cry\r\nall around and went back to the farm, and left her there to live with\r\nthe jailer\xe2\x80\x99s wife a month till the trial in October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nTOM SAWYER DISCOVERS THE MURDERERS\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, that was a hard month on us all. Poor Benny, she kept up the best\r\nshe could, and me and Tom tried to keep things cheerful there at the\r\nhouse, but it kind of went for nothing, as you may say. It was the same\r\nup at the jail. We went up every day to see the old people, but it was\r\nawful dreary, because the old man warn\xe2\x80\x99t sleeping much, and was walking\r\nin his sleep considerable and so he got to looking fagged and\r\nmiserable, and his mind got shaky, and we all got afraid his troubles\r\nwould break him down and kill him. And whenever we tried to persuade\r\nhim to feel cheerfuler, he only shook his head and said if we only\r\nknowed what it was to carry around a murderer\xe2\x80\x99s load in your heart we\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk that way. Tom and all of us kept telling him it _wasn\xe2\x80\x99t_\r\nmurder, but just accidental killing! but it never made any\r\ndifference\xe2\x80\x94it was murder, and he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have it any other way. He\r\nactu\xe2\x80\x99ly begun to come out plain and square towards trial time and\r\nacknowledge that he _tried_ to kill the man. Why, that was awful, you\r\nknow. It made things seem fifty times as dreadful, and there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\nmore comfort for Aunt Sally and Benny. But he promised he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\na word about his murder when others was around, and we was glad of\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Kept me up \xe2\x80\x99most all night.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTom Sawyer racked the head off of himself all that month trying to plan\r\nsome way out for Uncle Silas, and many\xe2\x80\x99s the night he kept me up \xe2\x80\x99most\r\nall night with this kind of tiresome work, but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to get\r\non the right track no way. As for me, I reckoned a body might as well\r\ngive it up, it all looked so blue and I was so downhearted; but he\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. He stuck to the business right along, and went on planning\r\nand thinking and ransacking his head.\r\n\r\nSo at last the trial come on, towards the middle of October, and we was\r\nall in the court. The place was jammed, of course. Poor old Uncle\r\nSilas, he looked more like a dead person than a live one, his eyes was\r\nso hollow and he looked so thin and so mournful. Benny she set on one\r\nside of him and Aunt Sally on the other, and they had veils on, and was\r\nfull of trouble. But Tom he set by our lawyer, and had his finger in\r\neverywheres, of course. The lawyer let him, and the judge let him. He\r\n\xe2\x80\x99most took the business out of the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s hands sometimes; which was\r\nwell enough, because that was only a mud-turtle of a back-settlement\r\nlawyer and didn\xe2\x80\x99t know enough to come in when it rains, as the saying\r\nis.\r\n\r\nThey swore in the jury, and then the lawyer for the prostitution got up\r\nand begun. He made a terrible speech against the old man, that made him\r\nmoan and groan, and made Benny and Aunt Sally cry. The way _he_ told\r\nabout the murder kind of knocked us all stupid it was so different from\r\nthe old man\xe2\x80\x99s tale. He said he was going to prove that Uncle Silas was\r\n_seen_ to kill Jubiter Dunlap by two good witnesses, and done it\r\ndeliberate, and _said_ he was going to kill him the very minute he hit\r\nhim with the club; and they seen him hide Jubiter in the bushes, and\r\nthey seen that Jubiter was stone-dead. And said Uncle Silas come later\r\nand lugged Jubiter down into the tobacker field, and two men seen him\r\ndo it. And said Uncle Silas turned out, away in the night, and buried\r\nJubiter, and a man seen him at it.\r\n\r\nI says to myself, poor old Uncle Silas has been lying about it because\r\nhe reckoned nobody seen him and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to break Aunt Sally\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart and Benny\xe2\x80\x99s; and right he was: as for me, I would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 lied the\r\nsame way, and so would anybody that had any feeling, to save them such\r\nmisery and sorrow which _they_ warn\xe2\x80\x99t no ways responsible for. Well, it\r\nmade our lawyer look pretty sick; and it knocked Tom silly, too, for a\r\nlittle spell, but then he braced up and let on that he warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nworried\xe2\x80\x94but I knowed he _was_, all the same. And the people\xe2\x80\x94my, but it\r\nmade a stir amongst them!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Our lawyer.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when that lawyer was done telling the jury what he was going to\r\nprove, he set down and begun to work his witnesses.\r\n\r\nFirst, he called a lot of them to show that there was bad blood betwixt\r\nUncle Silas and the diseased; and they told how they had heard Uncle\r\nSilas threaten the diseased, at one time and another, and how it got\r\nworse and worse and everybody was talking about it, and how diseased\r\ngot afraid of his life, and told two or three of them he was certain\r\nUncle Silas would up and kill him some time or another.\r\n\r\nTom and our lawyer asked them some questions; but it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use,\r\nthey stuck to what they said.\r\n\r\nNext, they called up Lem Beebe, and he took the stand. It come into my\r\nmind, then, how Lem and Jim Lane had come along talking, that time,\r\nabout borrowing a dog or something from Jubiter Dunlap; and that\r\nbrought up the blackberries and the lantern; and that brought up Bill\r\nand Jack Withers, and how they passed by, talking about a nigger\r\nstealing Uncle Silas\xe2\x80\x99s corn; and that fetched up our old ghost that\r\ncome along about the same time and scared us so\xe2\x80\x94and here _he_ was too,\r\nand a privileged character, on accounts of his being deef and dumb and\r\na stranger, and they had fixed him a chair inside the railing, where he\r\ncould cross his legs and be comfortable, whilst the other people was\r\nall in a jam so they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly breathe. So it all come back to me\r\njust the way it was that day; and it made me mournful to think how\r\npleasant it was up to then, and how miserable ever since.\r\n\r\n_Lem Beebe_, sworn, said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI was a-coming along, that day, second of\r\nSeptember, and Jim Lane was with me, and it was towards sundown, and we\r\nheard loud talk, like quarrelling, and we was very close, only the\r\nhazel bushes between (that\xe2\x80\x99s along the fence); and we heard a voice\r\nsay, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you more\xe2\x80\x99n once I\xe2\x80\x99d kill you,\xe2\x80\x99 and knowed it was this\r\nprisoner\xe2\x80\x99s voice; and then we see a club come up above the bushes and\r\ndown out of sight again, and heard a smashing thump and then a groan or\r\ntwo: and then we crope soft to where we could see, and there laid\r\nJupiter Dunlap dead, and this prisoner standing over him with the club;\r\nand the next he hauled the dead man into a clump of bushes and hid him,\r\nand then we stooped low, to be out of sight, and got away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, it was awful. It kind of froze everybody\xe2\x80\x99s blood to hear it, and\r\nthe house was \xe2\x80\x99most as still whilst he was telling it as if there\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t nobody in it. And when he was done, you could hear them gasp and\r\nsigh, all over the house, and look at one another the same as to say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t it perfectly terrible\xe2\x80\x94ain\xe2\x80\x99t it awful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow happened a thing that astonished me. All the time the first\r\nwitnesses was proving the bad blood and the threats and all that, Tom\r\nSawyer was alive and laying for them; and the minute they was through,\r\nhe went for them, and done his level best to catch them in lies and\r\nspile their testimony. But now, how different. When Lem first begun to\r\ntalk, and never said anything about speaking to Jubiter or trying to\r\nborrow a dog off of him, he was all alive and laying for Lem, and you\r\ncould see he was getting ready to cross-question him to death pretty\r\nsoon, and then I judged him and me would go on the stand by and by and\r\ntell what we heard him and Jim Lane say. But the next time I looked at\r\nTom I got the cold shivers. Why, he was in the brownest study you ever\r\nsee\xe2\x80\x94miles and miles away. He warn\xe2\x80\x99t hearing a word Lem Beebe was\r\nsaying; and when he got through he was still in that brown-study, just\r\nthe same. Our lawyer joggled him, and then he looked up startled, and\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9cTake the witness if you want him. Lemme alone\xe2\x80\x94I want to think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, that beat me. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand it. And Benny and her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x94oh, they looked sick, they was so troubled. They shoved their\r\nveils to one side and tried to get his eye, but it warn\xe2\x80\x99t any use, and\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get his eye either. So the mud-turtle he tackled the\r\nwitness, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t amount to nothing; and he made a mess of it.\r\n\r\nThen they called up Jim Lane, and he told the very same story over\r\nagain, exact. Tom never listened to this one at all, but set there\r\nthinking and thinking, miles and miles away. So the mud-turtle went in\r\nalone again and come out just as flat as he done before. The lawyer for\r\nthe prostitution looked very comfortable, but the judge looked\r\ndisgusted. You see, Tom was just the same as a regular lawyer, nearly,\r\nbecause it was Arkansaw law for a prisoner to choose anybody he wanted\r\nto help his lawyer, and Tom had had Uncle Silas shove him into the\r\ncase, and now he was botching it and you could see the judge didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike it much. All that the mud-turtle got out of Lem and Jim was this:\r\nhe asked them:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you go and tell what you saw?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe was afraid we would get mixed up in it ourselves. And we was just\r\nstarting down the river a-hunting for all the week besides; but as soon\r\nas we come back we found out they\xe2\x80\x99d been searching for the body, so\r\nthen we went and told Brace Dunlap all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen was that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaturday night, September 9th.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe judge he spoke up and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Sheriff, arrest these two witnesses on suspicions of being\r\naccessionary after the fact to the murder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lawyer for the prostitution jumps up all excited, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour honor! I protest against this extraordi\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cSet down!\xe2\x80\x9d says the judge.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSet down!\xe2\x80\x9d says the judge, pulling his bowie and laying it on his\r\npulpit. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg you to respect the Court.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he done it. Then he called Bill Withers.\r\n\r\n_Bill Withers_, sworn, said: \xe2\x80\x9cI was coming along about sundown,\r\nSaturday, September 2d, by the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s field, and my brother Jack\r\nwas with me and we seen a man toting off something heavy on his back\r\nand allowed it was a nigger stealing corn; we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see distinct;\r\nnext we made out that it was one man carrying another; and the way it\r\nhung, so kind of limp, we judged it was somebody that was drunk; and by\r\nthe man\xe2\x80\x99s walk we said it was Parson Silas, and we judged he had found\r\nSam Cooper drunk in the road, which he was always trying to reform him,\r\nand was toting him out of danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIt made the people shiver to think of poor old Uncle Silas toting off\r\nthe diseased down to the place in his tobacker field where the dog dug\r\nup the body, but there warn\xe2\x80\x99t much sympathy around amongst the faces,\r\nand I heard one cuss say \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis the coldest blooded work I ever struck,\r\nlugging a murdered man around like that, and going to bury him like a\r\nanimal, and him a preacher at that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom he went on thinking, and never took no notice; so our lawyer took\r\nthe witness and done the best he could, and it was plenty poor enough.\r\n\r\nThen Jack Withers he come on the stand and told the same tale, just\r\nlike Bill done.\r\n\r\nAnd after him comes Brace Dunlap, and he was looking very mournful, and\r\nmost crying; and there was a rustle and a stir all around, and\r\neverybody got ready to listen, and lots of the women folks said, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor\r\ncretur, poor cretur,\xe2\x80\x9d and you could see a many of them wiping their\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n_Brace Dunlap_, sworn, said: \xe2\x80\x9cI was in considerable trouble a long time\r\nabout my poor brother, but I reckoned things warn\xe2\x80\x99t near so bad as he\r\nmade out, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make myself believe anybody would have the\r\nheart to hurt a poor harmless cretur like that\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94[by jings, I was sure I\r\nseen Tom give a kind of a faint little start, and then look\r\ndisappointed again]\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand you know I _could\xe2\x80\x99t_ think a preacher would\r\nhurt him\xe2\x80\x94it warn\xe2\x80\x99t natural to think such an onlikely thing\xe2\x80\x94so I never\r\npaid much attention, and now I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t ever, ever forgive myself; for\r\nif I had a done different, my poor brother would be with me this day,\r\nand not laying yonder murdered, and him so harmless.\xe2\x80\x9d He kind of broke\r\ndown there and choked up, and waited to get his voice; and people all\r\naround said the most pitiful things, and women cried; and it was very\r\nstill in there, and solemn, and old Uncle Silas, poor thing, he give a\r\ngroan right out so everybody heard him.  Then Brace he went on,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaturday, September 2d, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t come home to supper. By-and-by I got\r\na little uneasy, and one of my niggers went over to this prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplace, but come back and said he warn\xe2\x80\x99t there.  So I got uneasier and\r\nuneasier, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t rest.  I went to bed, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep; and\r\nturned out, away late in the night, and went wandering over to this\r\nprisoner\xe2\x80\x99s place and all around about there a good while, hoping I\r\nwould run across my poor brother, and never knowing he was out of his\r\ntroubles and gone to a better shore\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d So he broke down and choked up\r\nagain, and most all the women was crying now.  Pretty soon he got\r\nanother start and says: \xe2\x80\x9cBut it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use; so at last I went home\r\nand tried to get some sleep, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Well, in a day or two\r\neverybody was uneasy, and they got to talking about this prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthreats, and took to the idea, which I didn\xe2\x80\x99t take no stock in, that my\r\nbrother was murdered so they hunted around and tried to find his body,\r\nbut couldn\xe2\x80\x99t and give it up.  And so I reckoned he was gone off somers\r\nto have a little peace, and would come back to us when his troubles was\r\nkind of healed.  But late Saturday night, the 9th, Lem Beebe and Jim\r\nLane come to my house and told me all\xe2\x80\x94told me the whole awful\r\n\xe2\x80\x99sassination, and my heart was broke. And _then_ I remembered something\r\nthat hadn\xe2\x80\x99t took no hold of me at the time, because reports said this\r\nprisoner had took to walking in his sleep and doing all kind of things\r\nof no consequence, not knowing what he was about.  I will tell you what\r\nthat thing was that come back into my memory. Away late that awful\r\nSaturday night when I was wandering around about this prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s place,\r\ngrieving and troubled, I was down by the corner of the tobacker-field\r\nand I heard a sound like digging in a gritty soil; and I crope nearer\r\nand peeped through the vines that hung on the rail fence and seen this\r\nprisoner _shoveling_\xe2\x80\x94shoveling with a long-handled shovel\xe2\x80\x94heaving earth\r\ninto a big hole that was most filled up; his back was to me, but it was\r\nbright moonlight and I knowed him by his old green baize work-gown with\r\na splattery white patch in the middle of the back like somebody had hit\r\nhim with a snowball. _He was burying the man he\xe2\x80\x99d murdered!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd he slumped down in his chair crying and sobbing, and \xe2\x80\x99most\r\neverybody in the house busted out wailing, and crying, and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s awful\xe2\x80\x94awful\xe2\x80\x94horrible!\xe2\x80\x9d and there was a most tremendous excitement,\r\nand you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear yourself think; and right in the midst of it up\r\njumps old Uncle Silas, white as a sheet, and sings out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_It\xe2\x80\x99s true, every word\xe2\x80\x94I murdered him in cold blood!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy Jackson, it petrified them! People rose up wild all over the house,\r\nstraining and staring for a better look at him, and the judge was\r\nhammering with his mallet and the sheriff yelling \xe2\x80\x9cOrder\xe2\x80\x94order in the\r\ncourt\xe2\x80\x94order!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd all the while the old man stood there a-quaking and his eyes\r\na-burning, and not looking at his wife and daughter, which was clinging\r\nto him and begging him to keep still, but pawing them off with his\r\nhands and saying he _would_ clear his black soul from crime, he _would_\r\nheave off this load that was more than he could bear, and he _wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t_\r\nbear it another hour! And then he raged right along with his awful\r\ntale, everybody a-staring and gasping, judge, jury, lawyers, and\r\neverybody, and Benny and Aunt Sally crying their hearts out. And by\r\nGeorge, Tom Sawyer never looked at him once! Never once\xe2\x80\x94just set there\r\ngazing with all his eyes at something else, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell what. And\r\nso the old man raged right along, pouring his words out like a stream\r\nof fire:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I struck to kill.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI killed him! I am guilty! But I never had the notion in my life to\r\nhurt him or harm him, spite of all them lies about my threatening him,\r\ntill the very minute I raised the club\xe2\x80\x94then my heart went cold!\xe2\x80\x94then\r\nthe pity all went out of it, and I struck to kill! In that one moment\r\nall my wrongs come into my mind; all the insults that that man and the\r\nscoundrel his brother, there, had put upon me, and how they laid in\r\ntogether to ruin me with the people, and take away my good name, and\r\n_drive_ me to some deed that would destroy me and my family that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\never done _them_ no harm, so help me God! And they done it in a mean\r\nrevenge\xe2\x80\x94for why? Because my innocent pure girl here at my side wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmarry that rich, insolent, ignorant coward, Brace Dunlap, who\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nsniveling here over a brother he never cared a brass farthing for\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d [I\r\nsee Tom give a jump and look glad _this_ time, to a dead certainty]\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94and in that moment I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you about, I forgot my God and\r\nremembered only my heart\xe2\x80\x99s bitterness, God forgive me, and I struck to\r\nkill. In one second I was miserably sorry\xe2\x80\x94oh, filled with remorse; but\r\nI thought of my poor family, and I _must_ hide what I\xe2\x80\x99d done for their\r\nsakes; and I did hide that corpse in the bushes; and presently I\r\ncarried it to the tobacker field; and in the deep night I went with my\r\nshovel and buried it where\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUp jumps Tom and shouts:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Now_, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it!\xe2\x80\x9d and waves his hand, oh, ever so fine and starchy,\r\ntowards the old man, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSet down! A murder _was_ done, but you never had no hand in it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A murder was done.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, sir, you could a heard a pin drop. And the old man he sunk down\r\nkind of bewildered in his seat and Aunt Sally and Benny didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it,\r\nbecause they was so astonished and staring at Tom with their mouths\r\nopen and not knowing what they was about. And the whole house the same.\r\nI never seen people look so helpless and tangled up, and I hain\xe2\x80\x99t ever\r\nseen eyes bug out and gaze without a blink the way theirn did. Tom\r\nsays, perfectly ca\xe2\x80\x99m:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour honor, may I speak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, yes\xe2\x80\x94go on!\xe2\x80\x9d says the judge, so astonished and mixed up\r\nhe didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what he was about hardly.\r\n\r\nThen Tom he stood there and waited a second or two\xe2\x80\x94that was for to work\r\nup an \xe2\x80\x9ceffect,\xe2\x80\x9d as he calls it\xe2\x80\x94then he started in just as ca\xe2\x80\x99m as ever,\r\nand says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor about two weeks now there\xe2\x80\x99s been a little bill sticking on the\r\nfront of this courthouse offering two thousand dollars reward for a\r\ncouple of big di\xe2\x80\x99monds\xe2\x80\x94stole at St. Louis. Them di\xe2\x80\x99monds is worth\r\ntwelve thousand dollars. But never mind about that till I get to it.\r\nNow about this murder. I will tell you all about it\xe2\x80\x94how it happened\xe2\x80\x94who\r\ndone it\xe2\x80\x94every _de_tail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYou could see everybody nestle now, and begin to listen for all they\r\nwas worth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis man here, Brace Dunlap, that\xe2\x80\x99s been sniveling so about his dead\r\nbrother that _you_ know he never cared a straw for, wanted to marry\r\nthat young girl there, and she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have him. So he told Uncle\r\nSilas he would make him sorry. Uncle Silas knowed how powerful he was,\r\nand how little chance he had against such a man, and he was scared and\r\nworried, and done everything he could think of to smooth him over and\r\nget him to be good to him: he even took his no-account brother Jubiter\r\non the farm and give him wages and stinted his own family to pay them;\r\nand Jubiter done everything his brother could contrive to insult Uncle\r\nSilas, and fret and worry him, and try to drive Uncle Silas into doing\r\nhim a hurt, so as to injure Uncle Silas with the people. And it done\r\nit. Everybody turned against him and said the meanest kind of things\r\nabout him, and it graduly broke his heart\xe2\x80\x94yes, and he was so worried\r\nand distressed that often he warn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly in his right mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, on that Saturday that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had so much trouble about, two of\r\nthese witnesses here, Lem Beebe and Jim Lane, come along by where Uncle\r\nSilas and Jubiter Dunlap was at work\xe2\x80\x94and that much of what they\xe2\x80\x99ve said\r\nis true, the rest is lies. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear Uncle Silas say he would\r\nkill Jubiter; they didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear no blow struck; they didn\xe2\x80\x99t see no dead\r\nman, and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t see Uncle Silas hide anything in the bushes. Look\r\nat them now\xe2\x80\x94how they set there, wishing they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been so handy with\r\ntheir tongues; anyway, they\xe2\x80\x99ll wish it before I get done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat same Saturday evening Bill and Jack Withers _did_ see one man\r\nlugging off another one. That much of what they said is true, and the\r\nrest is lies. First off they thought it was a nigger stealing Uncle\r\nSilas\xe2\x80\x99s corn\xe2\x80\x94you notice it makes them look silly, now, to find out\r\nsomebody overheard them say that. That\xe2\x80\x99s because they found out by and\r\nby who it was that was doing the lugging, and _they_ know best why they\r\nswore here that they took it for Uncle Silas by the gait\xe2\x80\x94which it\r\n_wasn\xe2\x80\x99t_, and they knowed it when they swore to that lie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man out in the moonlight _did_ see a murdered person put under\r\nground in the tobacker field\xe2\x80\x94but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Uncle Silas that done the\r\nburying. He was in his bed at that very time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, then, before I go on, I want to ask you if you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever noticed\r\nthis: that people, when they\xe2\x80\x99re thinking deep, or when they\xe2\x80\x99re worried,\r\nare most always doing something with their hands, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nit, and don\xe2\x80\x99t notice what it is their hands are doing, some stroke\r\ntheir chins; some stroke their noses; some stroke up _under_ their chin\r\nwith their hand; some twirl a chain, some fumble a button, then there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsome that draws a figure or a letter with their finger on their cheek,\r\nor under their chin or on their under lip. That\xe2\x80\x99s _my_ way. When I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nrestless, or worried, or thinking hard, I draw capital V\xe2\x80\x99s on my cheek\r\nor on my under lip or under my chin, and never anything _but_ capital\r\nV\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94and half the time I don\xe2\x80\x99t notice it and don\xe2\x80\x99t know I\xe2\x80\x99m doing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was odd. That is just what I do; only I make an O. And I could see\r\npeople nodding to one another, same as they do when they mean \xe2\x80\x9c_that\xe2\x80\x99_\r\nso.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, then, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go on. That same Saturday\xe2\x80\x94no, it was the night\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94there was a steamboat laying at Flagler\xe2\x80\x99s Landing, forty miles\r\nabove here, and it was raining and storming like the nation. And there\r\nwas a thief aboard, and he had them two big di\xe2\x80\x99monds that\xe2\x80\x99s advertised\r\nout here on this courthouse door; and he slipped ashore with his\r\nhand-bag and struck out into the dark and the storm, and he was\r\na-hoping he could get to this town all right and be safe. But he had\r\ntwo pals aboard the boat, hiding, and he knowed they was going to kill\r\nhim the first chance they got and take the di\xe2\x80\x99monds; because all three\r\nstole them, and then this fellow he got hold of them and skipped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been gone more\xe2\x80\x99n ten minutes before his pals found it\r\nout, and they jumped ashore and lit out after him. Prob\xe2\x80\x99ly they burnt\r\nmatches and found his tracks. Anyway, they dogged along after him all\r\nday Saturday and kept out of his sight; and towards sundown he come to\r\nthe bunch of sycamores down by Uncle Silas\xe2\x80\x99s field, and he went in\r\nthere to get a disguise out of his hand-bag and put it on before he\r\nshowed himself here in the town\xe2\x80\x94and mind you he done that just a little\r\nafter the time that Uncle Silas was hitting Jubiter Dunlap over the\r\nhead with a club\xe2\x80\x94for he _did_ hit him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the minute the pals see that thief slide into the bunch of\r\nsycamores, they jumped out of the bushes and slid in after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey fell on him and clubbed him to death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, for all he screamed and howled so, they never had no mercy on\r\nhim, but clubbed him to death. And two men that was running along the\r\nroad heard him yelling that way, and they made a rush into the sycamore\r\nbunch\xe2\x80\x94which was where they was bound for, anyway\xe2\x80\x94and when the pals saw\r\nthem they lit out and the two new men after them a-chasing them as\r\ntight as they could go. But only a minute or two\xe2\x80\x94then these two new men\r\nslipped back very quiet into the sycamores.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Then_ what did they do? I will tell you what they done. They found\r\nwhere the thief had got his disguise out of his carpet-sack to put on;\r\nso one of them strips and puts on that disguise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom waited a little here, for some more \xe2\x80\x9ceffect\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94then he says, very\r\ndeliberate:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man that put on that dead man\xe2\x80\x99s disguise was\xe2\x80\x94_Jubiter Dunlap!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Scott!\xe2\x80\x9d everybody shouted, all over the house, and old Uncle\r\nSilas he looked perfectly astonished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it was Jubiter Dunlap. Not dead, you see. Then they pulled off\r\nthe dead man\xe2\x80\x99s boots and put Jubiter Dunlap\xe2\x80\x99s old ragged shoes on the\r\ncorpse and put the corpse\xe2\x80\x99s boots on Jubiter Dunlap. Then Jubiter\r\nDunlap stayed where he was, and the other man lugged the dead body off\r\nin the twilight; and after midnight he went to Uncle Silas\xe2\x80\x99s house, and\r\ntook his old green work-robe off of the peg where it always hangs in\r\nthe passage betwixt the house and the kitchen and put it on, and stole\r\nthe long-handled shovel and went off down into the tobacker field and\r\nburied the murdered man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and stood half a minute. Then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who do you reckon the\r\nmurdered man _was?_ It was\xe2\x80\x94_Jake_ Dunlap, the long-lost burglar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Scott!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the man that buried him was\xe2\x80\x94_Brace_ Dunlap, his brother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Scott!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who do you reckon is this mowing idiot here that\xe2\x80\x99s letting on all\r\nthese weeks to be a deef and dumb stranger? It\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94_Jubiter_ Dunlap!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: And there was the murdered man.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMy land, they all busted out in a howl, and you never see the like of\r\nthat excitement since the day you was born. And Tom he made a jump for\r\nJubiter and snaked off his goggles and his false whiskers, and there\r\nwas the murdered man, sure enough, just as alive as anybody! And Aunt\r\nSally and Benny they went to hugging and crying and kissing and\r\nsmothering old Uncle Silas to that degree he was more muddled and\r\nconfused and mushed up in his mind than he ever was before, and that is\r\nsaying considerable. And next, people begun to yell:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom Sawyer! Tom Sawyer! Shut up everybody, and let him go on! Go on,\r\nTom Sawyer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Which made him feel uncommon bully.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich made him feel uncommon bully, for it was nuts for Tom Sawyer to\r\nbe a public character that-away, and a hero, as he calls it. So when it\r\nwas all quiet, he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere ain\xe2\x80\x99t much left, only this. When that man there, Bruce Dunlap,\r\nhad most worried the life and sense out of Uncle Silas till at last he\r\nplumb lost his mind and hit this other blatherskite, his brother, with\r\na club, I reckon he seen his chance. Jubiter broke for the woods to\r\nhide, and I reckon the game was for him to slide out, in the night, and\r\nleave the country. Then Brace would make everybody believe Uncle Silas\r\nkilled him and hid his body somers; and that would ruin Uncle Silas and\r\ndrive _him_ out of the country\xe2\x80\x94hang him, maybe; I dunno. But when they\r\nfound their dead brother in the sycamores without knowing him, because\r\nhe was so battered up, they see they had a better thing; disguise\r\n_both_ and bury Jake and dig him up presently all dressed up in\r\nJubiter\xe2\x80\x99s clothes, and hire Jim Lane and Bill Withers and the others to\r\nswear to some handy lies\xe2\x80\x94which they done. And there they set, now, and\r\nI told them they would be looking sick before I got done, and that is\r\nthe way they\xe2\x80\x99re looking now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, me and Huck Finn here, we come down on the boat with the\r\nthieves, and the dead one told us all about the di\xe2\x80\x99monds, and said the\r\nothers would murder him if they got the chance; and we was going to\r\nhelp him all we could. We was bound for the sycamores when we heard\r\nthem killing him in there; but we was in there in the early morning\r\nafter the storm and allowed nobody hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been killed, after all. And\r\nwhen we see Jubiter Dunlap here spreading around in the very same\r\ndisguise Jake told us _he_ was going to wear, we thought it was Jake\r\nhis own self\xe2\x80\x94and he was goo-gooing deef and dumb, and _that_ was\r\naccording to agreement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, me and Huck went on hunting for the corpse after the others\r\nquit, and we found it. And was proud, too; but Uncle Silas he knocked\r\nus crazy by telling us _he_ killed the man. So we was mighty sorry we\r\nfound the body, and was bound to save Uncle Silas\xe2\x80\x99s neck if we could;\r\nand it was going to be tough work, too, because he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let us\r\nbreak him out of prison the way we done with our old nigger Jim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI done everything I could the whole month to think up some way to save\r\nUncle Silas, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t strike a thing. So when we come into court\r\nto-day I come empty, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see no chance anywheres. But by and\r\nby I had a glimpse of something that set me thinking\xe2\x80\x94just a little wee\r\nglimpse\xe2\x80\x94only that, and not enough to make sure; but it set me thinking\r\nhard\xe2\x80\x94and _watching_, when I was only letting on to think; and by and\r\nby, sure enough, when Uncle Silas was piling out that stuff about _him_\r\nkilling Jubiter Dunlap, I catched that glimpse again, and this time I\r\njumped up and shut down the proceedings, because I _knowed_ Jubiter\r\nDunlap was a-setting here before me. I knowed him by a thing which I\r\nseen him do\xe2\x80\x94and I remembered it. I\xe2\x80\x99d seen him do it when I was here a\r\nyear ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped then, and studied a minute\xe2\x80\x94laying for an \xe2\x80\x9ceffect\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94I knowed\r\nit perfectly well. Then he turned off like he was going to leave the\r\nplatform, and says, kind of lazy and indifferent:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I believe that is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhy, you never heard such a howl!\xe2\x80\x94and it come from the whole house:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _was_ it you seen him do? Stay where you are, you little devil!\r\nYou think you are going to work a body up till his mouth\xe2\x80\x99s a-watering\r\nand stop there? What _was_ it he done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was it, you see\xe2\x80\x94he just done it to get an \xe2\x80\x9ceffect\xe2\x80\x9d; you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n\xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 pulled him off of that platform with a yoke of oxen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything much,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI seen him looking a little\r\nexcited when he found Uncle Silas was actually fixing to hang himself\r\nfor a murder that warn\xe2\x80\x99t ever done; and he got more and more nervous\r\nand worried, I a-watching him sharp but not seeming to look at him\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nall of a sudden his hands begun to work and fidget, and pretty soon his\r\nleft crept up and _his finger drawed a cross on his cheek_, and then I\r\n_had_ him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, then they ripped and howled and stomped and clapped their hands\r\ntill Tom Sawyer was that proud and happy he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do with\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nAnd then the judge he looked down over his pulpit and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy boy, did you _see_ all the various details of this strange\r\nconspiracy and tragedy that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been describing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, your honor, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see any of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t see any of them! Why, you\xe2\x80\x99ve told the whole history straight\r\nthrough, just the same as if you\xe2\x80\x99d seen it with your eyes. How did you\r\nmanage that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom says, kind of easy and comfortable:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, just noticing the evidence and piecing this and that together,\r\nyour honor; just an ordinary little bit of detective work; anybody\r\ncould \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 done it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing of the kind! Not two in a million could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 done it. You are a\r\nvery remarkable boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they let go and give Tom another smashing round, and he\xe2\x80\x94well, he\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 sold out for a silver mine. Then the judge says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut are you certain you\xe2\x80\x99ve got this curious history straight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly, your honor. Here is Brace Dunlap\xe2\x80\x94let him deny his share of\r\nit if he wants to take the chance; I\xe2\x80\x99ll engage to make him wish he\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t said anything...... Well, you see _he\xe2\x80\x99s_ pretty quiet. And his\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s pretty quiet, and them four witnesses that lied so and got\r\npaid for it, they\xe2\x80\x99re pretty quiet. And as for Uncle Silas, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t any\r\nuse for him to put in his oar, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe him under oath!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, sir, that fairly made them shout; and even the judge he let go\r\nand laughed. Tom he was just feeling like a rainbow. When they was done\r\nlaughing he looks up at the judge and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour honor, there\xe2\x80\x99s a thief in this house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA thief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir. And he\xe2\x80\x99s got them twelve-thousand-dollar di\xe2\x80\x99monds on him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy gracious, but it made a stir! Everybody went shouting:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is him? which is him? p\xe2\x80\x99int him out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the judge says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoint him out, my lad. Sheriff, you will arrest him. Which one is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis late dead man here\xe2\x80\x94Jubiter Dunlap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen there was another thundering let-go of astonishment and\r\nexcitement; but Jubiter, which was astonished enough before, was just\r\nfairly putrified with astonishment this time. And he spoke up, about\r\nhalf crying, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow _that\xe2\x80\x99s_ a lie. Your honor, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t fair; I\xe2\x80\x99m plenty bad enough\r\nwithout that. I done the other things\xe2\x80\x94Brace he put me up to it, and\r\npersuaded me, and promised he\xe2\x80\x99d make me rich, some day, and I done it,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I done it, and I wisht I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t; but I hain\xe2\x80\x99t stole no\r\ndi\xe2\x80\x99monds, and I hain\xe2\x80\x99t _got_ no di\xe2\x80\x99monds; I wisht I may never stir if\r\nit ain\xe2\x80\x99t so. The sheriff can search me and see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour honor, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t right to call him a thief, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll let up on\r\nthat a little. He did steal the di\xe2\x80\x99monds, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it. He\r\nstole them from his brother Jake when he was laying dead, after Jake\r\nhad stole them from the other thieves; but Jubiter didn\xe2\x80\x99t know he was\r\nstealing them; and he\xe2\x80\x99s been swelling around here with them a month;\r\nyes, sir, twelve thousand dollars\xe2\x80\x99 worth of di\xe2\x80\x99monds on him\xe2\x80\x94all that\r\nriches, and going around here every day just like a poor man. Yes, your\r\nhonor, he\xe2\x80\x99s got them on him now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe judge spoke up and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSearch him, sheriff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Searched his seams and his pockets and his socks.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, sir, the sheriff he ransacked him high and low, and everywhere:\r\nsearched his hat, socks, seams, boots, everything\xe2\x80\x94and Tom he stood\r\nthere quiet, laying for another of them effects of hisn. Finally the\r\nsheriff he give it up, and everybody looked disappointed, and Jubiter\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, now! what\xe2\x80\x99d I tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the judge says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt appears you were mistaken this time, my boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Tom took an attitude and let on to be studying with all his might,\r\nand scratching his head. Then all of a sudden he glanced up chipper,\r\nand says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, now I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it! I\xe2\x80\x99d forgot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhich was a lie, and I knowed it. Then he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill somebody be good enough to lend me a little small screwdriver?\r\nThere was one in your brother\xe2\x80\x99s hand-bag that you smouched, Jubiter,\r\nbut I reckon you didn\xe2\x80\x99t fetch it with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want it, and I give it away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s because you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what it was for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJubiter had his boots on again, by now, and when the thing Tom wanted\r\nwas passed over the people\xe2\x80\x99s heads till it got to him, he says to\r\nJubiter:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut up your foot on this chair.\xe2\x80\x9d And he kneeled down and begun to\r\nunscrew the heel-plate, everybody watching; and when he got that big\r\ndi\xe2\x80\x99mond out of that boot-heel and held it up and let it flash and blaze\r\nand squirt sunlight everwhichaway, it just took everybody\xe2\x80\x99s breath; and\r\nJubiter he looked so sick and sorry you never see the like of it. And\r\nwhen Tom held up the other di\xe2\x80\x99mond he looked sorrier than ever. Land!\r\nhe was thinking how he would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 skipped out and been rich and\r\nindependent in a foreign land if he\xe2\x80\x99d only had the luck to guess what\r\nthe screwdriver was in the carpet-bag for.\r\n\r\nWell, it was a most exciting time, take it all around, and Tom got\r\ncords of glory. The judge took the di\xe2\x80\x99monds, and stood up in his\r\npulpit, and cleared his throat, and shoved his spectacles back on his\r\nhead, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll keep them and notify the owners; and when they send for them it\r\nwill be a real pleasure to me to hand you the two thousand dollars, for\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve earned the money\xe2\x80\x94yes, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve earned the deepest and most\r\nsincerest thanks of this community besides, for lifting a wronged and\r\ninnocent family out of ruin and shame, and saving a good and honorable\r\nman from a felon\xe2\x80\x99s death, and for exposing to infamy and the punishment\r\nof the law a cruel and odious scoundrel and his miserable creatures!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, sir, if there\xe2\x80\x99d been a brass band to bust out some music, then,\r\nit would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been just the perfectest thing I ever see, and Tom Sawyer\r\nhe said the same.\r\n\r\nThen the sheriff he nabbed Brace Dunlap and his crowd, and by and by\r\nnext month the judge had them up for trial and jailed the whole lot.\r\nAnd everybody crowded back to Uncle Silas\xe2\x80\x99s little old church, and was\r\never so loving and kind to him and the family and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do enough\r\nfor them; and Uncle Silas he preached them the blamedest jumbledest\r\nidiotic sermons you ever struck, and would tangle you up so you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t find your way home in daylight; but the people never let on\r\nbut what they thought it was the clearest and brightest and elegantest\r\nsermons that ever was; and they would set there and cry, for love and\r\npity; but, by George, they give me the jim-jams and the fan-tods and\r\ncaked up what brains I had, and turned them solid; but by and by they\r\nloved the old man\xe2\x80\x99s intellects back into him again, and he was as sound\r\nin his skull as ever he was, which ain\xe2\x80\x99t no flattery, I reckon. And so\r\nthe whole family was as happy as birds, and nobody could be gratefuler\r\nand lovinger than what they was to Tom Sawyer; and the same to me,\r\nthough I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done nothing. And when the two thousand dollars come,\r\nTom give half of it to me, and never told anybody so, which didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsurprise me, because I knowed him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom, give half of it to me.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TOM SAWYER, DETECTIVE ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
