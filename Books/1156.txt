They were neither citadels nor churches, but frankly and\nbeautifully office-buildings.\n\nThe mist took pity on the fretted structures of earlier generations: the\nPost Office with its shingle-tortured mansard, the red brick minarets of\nhulking old houses, factories with stingy and sooted windows, wooden\ntenements colored like mud. The city was full of such grotesqueries, but\nthe clean towers were thrusting them from the business center, and on\nthe farther hills were shining new houses, homes--they seemed--for\nlaughter and tranquillity.\n\nOver a concrete bridge fled a limousine of long sleek hood and noiseless\nengine. These people in evening clothes were returning from an all-night\nrehearsal of a Little Theater play, an artistic adventure considerably\nilluminated by champagne. Below the bridge curved a railroad, a maze of\ngreen and crimson lights. The New York Flyer boomed past, and twenty\nlines of polished steel leaped into the glare.\n\nIn one of the skyscrapers the wires of the Associated Press were closing\ndown. The telegraph operators wearily raised their celluloid eye-shades\nafter a night of talking with Paris and Peking. Through the building\ncrawled the scrubwomen, yawning, their old shoes slapping. The dawn mist\nspun away. Cues of men with lunch-boxes clumped toward the immensity of\nnew factories, sheets of glass and hollow tile, glittering shops where\nfive thousand men worked beneath one roof, pouring out the honest wares\nthat would be sold up the Euphrates and across the veldt. The whistles\nrolled out in greeting a chorus cheerful as the April dawn; the song of\nlabor in a city built--it seemed--for giants.\n\n\nII\n\nThere was nothing of the giant in the aspect of the man who was\nbeginning to awaken on the sleeping-porch of a Dutch Colonial house in\nthat residential district of Zenith known as Floral Heights.\n\nHis name was George F. Babbitt. He was forty-six years old now, in\nApril, 1920, and he made nothing in particular, neither butter nor shoes\nnor poetry, but he was nimble in the calling of selling houses for more\nthan people could afford to pay.\n\nHis large head was pink, his brown hair thin and dry. His face was\nbabyish in slumber, despite his wrinkles and the red spectacle-dents on\nthe slopes of his nose. He was not fat but he was exceedingly well fed;\nhis cheeks were pads, and the unroughened hand which lay helpless upon\nthe khaki-colored blanket was slightly puffy. He seemed prosperous,\nextremely married and unromantic; and altogether unromantic appeared\nthis sleeping-porch, which looked on one sizable elm, two respectable\ngrass-plots, a cement driveway, and a corrugated iron garage. Yet\nBabbitt was again dreaming of the fairy child, a dream more romantic\nthan scarlet pagodas by a silver sea.\n\nFor years the fairy child had come to him. Where others saw but Georgie\nBabbitt, she discerned gallant youth. She waited for him, in the\ndarkness beyond mysterious groves. When at last he could slip away from\nthe crowded house he darted to her. His wife, his clamoring friends,\nsought to follow, but he escaped, the girl fleet beside him, and they\ncrouched together on a shadowy hillside. She was so slim, so white, so\neager! She cried that he was gay and valiant, that she would wait for\nhim, that they would sail--\n\nRumble and bang of the milk-truck.\n\nBabbitt moaned, turned over, struggled back toward his dream. He could\nsee only her face now, beyond misty waters. The furnace-man slammed the\nbasement door. A dog barked in the next yard. As Babbitt sank blissfully\ninto a dim warm tide, the paper-carrier went by whistling, and the\nrolled-up _Advocate_ thumped the front door. Babbitt roused, his stomach\nconstricted with alarm. As he relaxed, he was pierced by the familiar\nand irritating rattle of some one cranking a Ford: snap-ah-ah,\nsnap-ah-ah, snap-ah-ah. Himself a pious motorist, Babbitt cranked with\nthe unseen driver, with him waited through taut hours for the roar of\nthe starting engine, with him agonized as the roar ceased and again\nbegan the infernal patient snap-ah-ah--a round, flat sound, a shivering\ncold-morning sound, a sound infuriating and inescapable. Not till the\nrising voice of the motor told him that the Ford was moving was he\nreleased from the panting tension. He glanced once at his favorite tree,\nelm twigs against the gold patina of sky, and fumbled for sleep as for a\ndrug. He who had been a boy very credulous of life was no longer greatly\ninterested in the possible and improbable adventures of each new day.\n\nHe escaped from reality till the alarm-clock rang, at seven-twenty.\n\n\nIII\n\nIt was the best of nationally advertised and quantitatively produced\nalarm-clocks, with all modern attachments, including cathedral chime,\nintermittent alarm, and a phosphorescent dial. Babbitt was proud of\nbeing awakened by such a rich device. Socially it was almost as\ncreditable as buying expensive cord tires.\n\nHe sulkily admitted now that there was no more escape, but he lay and\ndetested the grind of the real-estate business, and disliked his family,\nand disliked himself for disliking them. The evening before, he had\nplayed poker at Vergil Gunch\xe2\x80\x99s till midnight, and after such holidays he\nwas irritable before breakfast. It may have been the tremendous\nhome-brewed beer of the prohibition-era and the cigars to which that\nbeer enticed him; it may have been resentment of return from this fine,\nbold man-world to a restricted region of wives and stenographers, and of\nsuggestions not to smoke so much.\n\nFrom the bedroom beside the sleeping-porch, his wife\xe2\x80\x99s detestably\ncheerful \xe2\x80\x9cTime to get up, Georgie boy,\xe2\x80\x9d and the itchy sound, the brisk\nand scratchy sound, of combing hairs out of a stiff brush.\n\nHe grunted; he dragged his thick legs, in faded baby-blue pajamas, from\nunder the khaki blanket; he sat on the edge of the cot, running his\nfingers through his wild hair, while his plump feet mechanically felt\nfor his slippers. He looked regretfully at the blanket--forever a\nsuggestion to him of freedom and heroism. He had bought it for a camping\ntrip which had never come off. It symbolized gorgeous loafing, gorgeous\ncursing, virile flannel shirts.\n\nHe creaked to his feet, groaning at the waves of pain which passed\nbehind his eyeballs. Though he waited for their scorching recurrence, he\nlooked blurrily out at the yard. It delighted him, as always; it was the\nneat yard of a successful business man of Zenith, that is, it was\nperfection, and made him also perfect. He regarded the corrugated iron\ngarage. For the three-hundred-and-sixty-fifth time in a year he\nreflected, \xe2\x80\x9cNo class to that tin shack. Have to build me a frame garage.\nBut by golly it\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing on the place that isn\xe2\x80\x99t up-to-date!\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhile he stared he thought of a community garage for his acreage\ndevelopment, Glen Oriole. He stopped puffing and jiggling. His arms\nwere akimbo. His petulant, sleep-swollen face was set in harder lines.\nHe suddenly seemed capable, an official, a man to contrive, to direct,\nto get things done.\n\nOn the vigor of his idea he was carried down the hard, clean,\nunused-looking hall into the bathroom.\n\nThough the house was not large it had, like all houses on Floral\nHeights, an altogether royal bathroom of porcelain and glazed tile and\nmetal sleek as silver. The towel-rack was a rod of clear glass set in\nnickel. The tub was long enough for a Prussian Guard, and above the set\nbowl was a sensational exhibit of tooth-brush holder, shaving-brush\nholder, soap-dish, sponge-dish, and medicine-cabinet, so glittering and\nso ingenious that they resembled an electrical instrument-board. But the\nBabbitt whose god was Modern Appliances was not pleased. The air of the\nbathroom was thick with the smell of a heathen toothpaste. \xe2\x80\x9cVerona been\nat it again! \xe2\x80\x99Stead of sticking to Lilidol, like I\xe2\x80\x99ve re-peat-ed-ly\nasked her, she\xe2\x80\x99s gone and gotten some confounded stinkum stuff that\nmakes you sick!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe bath-mat was wrinkled and the floor was wet. (His daughter Verona\neccentrically took baths in the morning, now and then.) He slipped on\nthe mat, and slid against the tub. He said \xe2\x80\x9cDamn!\xe2\x80\x9d Furiously he snatched\nup his tube of shaving-cream, furiously he lathered, with a belligerent\nslapping of the unctuous brush, furiously he raked his plump cheeks with\na safety-razor. It pulled. The blade was dull. He said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn--oh--oh--damn it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe hunted through the medicine-cabinet for a packet of new razor-blades\n(reflecting, as invariably, \xe2\x80\x9cBe cheaper to buy one of these dinguses and\nstrop your own blades,\xe2\x80\x9d) and when he discovered the packet, behind the\nround box of bicarbonate of soda, he thought ill of his wife for putting\nit there and very well of himself for not saying \xe2\x80\x9cDamn.\xe2\x80\x9d But he did say\nit, immediately afterward, when with wet and soap-slippery fingers he\ntried to remove the horrible little envelope and crisp clinging oiled\npaper from the new blade.\n\nThen there was the problem, oft-pondered, never solved, of what to do\nwith the old blade, which might imperil the fingers of his young. As\nusual, he tossed it on top of the medicine-cabinet, with a mental note\nthat some day he must remove the fifty or sixty other blades that were\nalso temporarily piled up there. He finished his shaving in a growing\ntestiness increased by his spinning headache and by the emptiness in his\nstomach. When he was done, his round face smooth and streamy and his\neyes stinging from soapy water, he reached for a towel. The family\ntowels were wet, wet and clammy and vile, all of them wet, he found, as\nhe blindly snatched them--his own face-towel, his wife\xe2\x80\x99s, Verona\xe2\x80\x99s,\nTed\xe2\x80\x99s, Tinka\xe2\x80\x99s, and the lone bath-towel with the huge welt of initial.\nThen George F. Babbitt did a dismaying thing. He wiped his face on the\nguest-towel! It was a pansy-embroidered trifle which always hung there\nto indicate that the Babbitts were in the best Floral Heights society.\nNo one had ever used it. No guest had ever dared to. Guests secretively\ntook a corner of the nearest regular towel.\n\nHe was raging, \xe2\x80\x9cBy golly, here they go and use up all the towels, every\ndoggone one of \xe2\x80\x99em, and they use \xe2\x80\x99em and get \xe2\x80\x99em all wet and sopping,\nand never put out a dry one for me--of course, I\xe2\x80\x99m the goat!--and then I\nwant one and-- I\xe2\x80\x99m the only person in the doggone house that\xe2\x80\x99s got the\nslightest doggone bit of consideration for other people and\nthoughtfulness and consider there may be others that may want to use the\ndoggone bathroom after me and consider--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe was pitching the chill abominations into the bath-tub, pleased by the\nvindictiveness of that desolate flapping sound; and in the midst his\nwife serenely trotted in, observed serenely, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy Georgie dear, what are\nyou doing? Are you going to wash out the towels? Why, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t wash\nout the towels. Oh, Georgie, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t go and use the guest-towel, did\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt is not recorded that he was able to answer.\n\nFor the first time in weeks he was sufficiently roused by his wife to\nlook at her.\n\n\nIV\n\nMyra Babbitt--Mrs. George F. Babbitt--was definitely mature. She had\ncreases from the corners of her mouth to the bottom of her chin, and her\nplump neck bagged. But the thing that marked her as having passed the\nline was that she no longer had reticences before her husband, and no\nlonger worried about not having reticences. She was in a petticoat now,\nand corsets which bulged, and unaware of being seen in bulgy corsets.\nShe had become so dully habituated to married life that in her full\nmatronliness she was as sexless as an anemic nun. She was a good woman,\na kind woman, a diligent woman, but no one, save perhaps Tinka her\nten-year-old, was at all interested in her or entirely aware that she\nwas alive.\n\nAfter a rather thorough discussion of all the domestic and social\naspects of towels she apologized to Babbitt for his having an alcoholic\nheadache; and he recovered enough to endure the search for a B.V.D.\nundershirt which had, he pointed out, malevolently been concealed among\nhis clean pajamas.\n\nHe was fairly amiable in the conference on the brown suit.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think, Myra?\xe2\x80\x9d He pawed at the clothes hunched on a chair in\ntheir bedroom, while she moved about mysteriously adjusting and patting\nher petticoat and, to his jaundiced eye, never seeming to get on with\nher dressing. \xe2\x80\x9cHow about it? Shall I wear the brown suit another day?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it looks awfully nice on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, but gosh, it needs pressing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so. Perhaps it does.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt certainly could stand being pressed, all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, perhaps it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt it to be pressed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut gee, the coat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need pressing. No sense in having the whole\ndarn suit pressed, when the coat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the pants certainly need it, all right. Look at them--look at those\nwrinkles--the pants certainly do need pressing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so. Oh, Georgie, why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you wear the brown coat with the\nblue trousers we were wondering what we\xe2\x80\x99d do with them?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord! Did you ever in all my life know me to wear the coat of one\nsuit and the pants of another? What do you think I am? A busted\nbookkeeper?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you put on the dark gray suit to-day, and stop in at\nthe tailor and leave the brown trousers?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they certainly need-- Now where the devil is that gray suit? Oh,\nyes, here we are.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe was able to get through the other crises of dressing with comparative\nresoluteness and calm.\n\nHis first adornment was the sleeveless dimity B.V.D. undershirt, in\nwhich he resembled a small boy humorlessly wearing a cheesecloth tabard\nat a civic pageant. He never put on B.V.D.\xe2\x80\x99s without thanking the God of\nProgress that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t wear tight, long, old-fashioned undergarments,\nlike his father-in-law and partner, Henry Thompson. His second\nembellishment was combing and slicking back his hair. It gave him a\ntremendous forehead, arching up two inches beyond the former hair-line.\nBut most wonder-working of all was the donning of his spectacles.\n\nThere is character in spectacles--the pretentious tortoise-shell, the\nmeek pince-nez of the school teacher, the twisted silver-framed glasses\nof the old villager. Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s spectacles had huge, circular, frameless\nlenses of the very best glass; the ear-pieces were thin bars of gold. In\nthem he was the modern business man; one who gave orders to clerks and\ndrove a car and played occasional golf and was scholarly in regard to\nSalesmanship. His head suddenly appeared not babyish but weighty, and\nyou noted his heavy, blunt nose, his straight mouth and thick, long\nupper lip, his chin overfleshy but strong; with respect you beheld him\nput on the rest of his uniform as a Solid Citizen.\n\nThe gray suit was well cut, well made, and completely undistinguished.\nIt was a standard suit. White piping on the V of the vest added a flavor\nof law and learning. His shoes were black laced boots, good boots,\nhonest boots, standard boots, extraordinarily uninteresting boots. The\nonly frivolity was in his purple knitted scarf. With considerable\ncomment on the matter to Mrs. Babbitt (who, acrobatically fastening the\nback of her blouse to her skirt with a safety-pin, did not hear a word\nhe said), he chose between the purple scarf and a tapestry effect with\nstringless brown harps among blown palms, and into it he thrust a\nsnake-head pin with opal eyes.\n\nA sensational event was changing from the brown suit to the gray the\ncontents of his pockets. He was earnest about these objects. They were\nof eternal importance, like baseball or the Republican Party. They\nincluded a fountain pen and a silver pencil (always lacking a supply of\nnew leads) which belonged in the righthand upper vest pocket. Without\nthem he would have felt naked. On his watch-chain were a gold penknife,\nsilver cigar-cutter, seven keys (the use of two of which he had\nforgotten), and incidentally a good watch. Depending from the chain was\na large, yellowish elk\xe2\x80\x99s-tooth--proclamation of his membership in the\nBrotherly and Protective Order of Elks. Most significant of all was his\nloose-leaf pocket note-book, that modern and efficient note-book which\ncontained the addresses of people whom he had forgotten, prudent\nmemoranda of postal money-orders which had reached their destinations\nmonths ago, stamps which had lost their mucilage, clippings of verses by\nT. Cholmondeley Frink and of the newspaper editorials from which Babbitt\ngot his opinions and his polysyllables, notes to be sure and do things\nwhich he did not intend to do, and one curious inscription--D.S.S.D.M.Y.P.D.F.\n\nBut he had no cigarette-case. No one had ever happened to give him one,\nso he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the habit, and people who carried cigarette-cases he\nregarded as effeminate.\n\nLast, he stuck in his lapel the Boosters\xe2\x80\x99 Club button. With the\nconciseness of great art the button displayed two words:\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoosters--Pep!\xe2\x80\x9d It made Babbitt feel loyal and important. It associated\nhim with Good Fellows, with men who were nice and human, and important\nin business circles. It was his V.C., his Legion of Honor ribbon, his\nPhi Beta Kappa key.\n\nWith the subtleties of dressing ran other complex worries. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel kind\nof punk this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I had too much dinner last\nevening. You oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to serve those heavy banana fritters.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you asked me to have some.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, but-- I tell you, when a fellow gets past forty he has to look\nafter his digestion. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of fellows that don\xe2\x80\x99t take proper\ncare of themselves. I tell you at forty a man\xe2\x80\x99s a fool or his doctor-- I\nmean, his own doctor. Folks don\xe2\x80\x99t give enough attention to this matter\nof dieting. Now I think-- Course a man ought to have a good meal after\nthe day\xe2\x80\x99s work, but it would be a good thing for both of us if we took\nlighter lunches.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Georgie, here at home I always do have a light lunch.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMean to imply I make a hog of myself, eating down-town? Yes, sure!\nYou\xe2\x80\x99d have a swell time if you had to eat the truck that new steward\nhands out to us at the Athletic Club! But I certainly do feel out of\nsorts, this morning. Funny, got a pain down here on the left side--but\nno, that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be appendicitis, would it? Last night, when I was\ndriving over to Verg Gunch\xe2\x80\x99s, I felt a pain in my stomach, too. Right\nhere it was--kind of a sharp shooting pain. I-- Where\xe2\x80\x99d that dime go to?\nWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you serve more prunes at breakfast? Of course I eat an apple\nevery evening--an apple a day keeps the doctor away--but still, you\nought to have more prunes, and not all these fancy doodads.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe last time I had prunes you didn\xe2\x80\x99t eat them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like eating \xe2\x80\x99em, I suppose. Matter of fact, I think\nI did eat some of \xe2\x80\x99em. Anyway-- I tell you it\xe2\x80\x99s mighty important to-- I\nwas saying to Verg Gunch, just last evening, most people don\xe2\x80\x99t take\nsufficient care of their diges--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we have the Gunches for our dinner, next week?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy sure; you bet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow see here, George: I want you to put on your nice dinner-jacket that\nevening.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRats! The rest of \xe2\x80\x99em won\xe2\x80\x99t want to dress.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course they will. You remember when you didn\xe2\x80\x99t dress for the\nLittlefields\xe2\x80\x99 supper-party, and all the rest did, and how embarrassed\nyou were.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmbarrassed, hell! I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t embarrassed. Everybody knows I can put on\nas expensive a Tux. as anybody else, and I should worry if I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nhappen to have it on sometimes. All a darn nuisance, anyway. All right\nfor a woman, that stays around the house all the time, but when a\nfellow\xe2\x80\x99s worked like the dickens all day, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go and\nhustle his head off getting into the soup-and-fish for a lot of folks\nthat he\xe2\x80\x99s seen in just reg\xe2\x80\x99lar ordinary clothes that same day.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know you enjoy being seen in one. The other evening you admitted\nyou were glad I\xe2\x80\x99d insisted on your dressing. You said you felt a lot\nbetter for it. And oh, Georgie, I do wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x98Tux.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s\n\xe2\x80\x98dinner-jacket.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRats, what\xe2\x80\x99s the odds?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s what all the nice folks say. Suppose Lucile McKelvey heard\nyou calling it a \xe2\x80\x98Tux.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right now! Lucile McKelvey can\xe2\x80\x99t pull anything on me!\nHer folks are common as mud, even if her husband and her dad are\nmillionaires! I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to rub in _your_ exalted social\nposition! Well, let me tell you that your revered paternal ancestor,\nHenry T., doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even call it a \xe2\x80\x98Tux.\xe2\x80\x99! He calls it a \xe2\x80\x98bobtail jacket\nfor a ringtail monkey,\xe2\x80\x99 and you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get him into one unless you\nchloroformed him!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow don\xe2\x80\x99t be horrid, George.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be horrid, but Lord! you\xe2\x80\x99re getting as fussy as\nVerona. Ever since she got out of college she\xe2\x80\x99s been too rambunctious to\nlive with--doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what she wants--well, I know what she\nwants!--all she wants is to marry a millionaire, and live in Europe, and\nhold some preacher\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and simultaneously at the same time stay\nright here in Zenith and be some blooming kind of a socialist agitator\nor boss charity-worker or some damn thing! Lord, and Ted is just as bad!\nHe wants to go to college, and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to college. Only\none of the three that knows her own mind is Tinka. Simply can\xe2\x80\x99t\nunderstand how I ever came to have a pair of shillyshallying children\nlike Rone and Ted. I may not be any Rockefeller or James J. Shakespeare,\nbut I certainly do know my own mind, and I do keep right on plugging\nalong in the office and-- Do you know the latest? Far as I can figure\nout, Ted\xe2\x80\x99s new bee is he\xe2\x80\x99d like to be a movie actor and-- And here I\xe2\x80\x99ve\ntold him a hundred times, if he\xe2\x80\x99ll go to college and law-school and make\ngood, I\xe2\x80\x99ll set him up in business and-- Verona just exactly as bad.\nDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what she wants. Well, well, come on! Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you ready yet?\nThe girl rang the bell three minutes ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nV\n\nBefore he followed his wife, Babbitt stood at the westernmost window of\ntheir room. This residential settlement, Floral Heights, was on a rise;\nand though the center of the city was three miles away-- Zenith had\nbetween three and four hundred thousand inhabitants now--he could see\nthe top of the Second National Tower, an Indiana limestone building of\nthirty-five stories.\n\nIts shining walls rose against April sky to a simple cornice like a\nstreak of white fire. Integrity was in the tower, and decision. It bore\nits strength lightly as a tall soldier. As Babbitt stared, the\nnervousness was soothed from his face, his slack chin lifted in\nreverence. All he articulated was \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s one lovely sight!\xe2\x80\x9d but he was\ninspired by the rhythm of the city; his love of it renewed. He beheld\nthe tower as a temple-spire of the religion of business, a faith\npassionate, exalted, surpassing common men; and as he clumped down to\nbreakfast he whistled the ballad \xe2\x80\x9cOh, by gee, by gosh, by jingo\xe2\x80\x9d as\nthough it were a hymn melancholy and noble.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nI\n\nRelieved of Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s bumbling and the soft grunts with which his wife\nexpressed the sympathy she was too experienced to feel and much too\nexperienced not to show, their bedroom settled instantly into\nimpersonality.\n\nIt gave on the sleeping-porch. It served both of them as dressing-room,\nand on the coldest nights Babbitt luxuriously gave up the duty of being\nmanly and retreated to the bed inside, to curl his toes in the warmth\nand laugh at the January gale.\n\nThe room displayed a modest and pleasant color-scheme, after one of the\nbest standard designs of the decorator who \xe2\x80\x9cdid the interiors\xe2\x80\x9d for most\nof the speculative-builders\xe2\x80\x99 houses in Zenith. The walls were gray, the\nwoodwork white, the rug a serene blue; and very much like mahogany was\nthe furniture--the bureau with its great clear mirror, Mrs. Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s\ndressing-table with toilet-articles of almost solid silver, the plain\ntwin beds, between them a small table holding a standard electric\nbedside lamp, a glass for water, and a standard bedside book with\ncolored illustrations--what particular book it was cannot be\nascertained, since no one had ever opened it. The mattresses were firm\nbut not hard, triumphant modern mattresses which had cost a great deal\nof money; the hot-water radiator was of exactly the proper scientific\nsurface for the cubic contents of the room. The windows were large and\neasily opened, with the best catches and cords, and Holland\nroller-shades guaranteed not to crack. It was a masterpiece among\nbedrooms, right out of Cheerful Modern Houses for Medium Incomes. Only\nit had nothing to do with the Babbitts, nor with any one else. If\npeople had ever lived and loved here, read thrillers at midnight and\nlain in beautiful indolence on a Sunday morning, there were no signs of\nit. It had the air of being a very good room in a very good hotel. One\nexpected the chambermaid to come in and make it ready for people who\nwould stay but one night, go without looking back, and never think of it\nagain.\n\nEvery second house in Floral Heights had a bedroom precisely like this.\n\nThe Babbitts\xe2\x80\x99 house was five years old. It was all as competent and\nglossy as this bedroom. It had the best of taste, the best of\ninexpensive rugs, a simple and laudable architecture, and the latest\nconveniences. Throughout, electricity took the place of candles and\nslatternly hearth-fires. Along the bedroom baseboard were three plugs\nfor electric lamps, concealed by little brass doors. In the halls were\nplugs for the vacuum cleaner, and in the living-room plugs for the piano\nlamp, for the electric fan. The trim dining-room (with its admirable oak\nbuffet, its leaded-glass cupboard, its creamy plaster walls, its modest\nscene of a salmon expiring upon a pile of oysters) had plugs which\nsupplied the electric percolator and the electric toaster.\n\nIn fact there was but one thing wrong with the Babbitt house: It was not\na home.\n\n\nII\n\nOften of a morning Babbitt came bouncing and jesting in to breakfast.\nBut things were mysteriously awry to-day. As he pontifically tread the\nupper hall he looked into Verona\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom and protested, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the\nuse of giving the family a high-class house when they don\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate\nit and tend to business and get down to brass tacks?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe marched upon them: Verona, a dumpy brown-haired girl of twenty-two,\njust out of Bryn Mawr, given to solicitudes about duty and sex and God\nand the unconquerable bagginess of the gray sports-suit she was now\nwearing. Ted--Theodore Roosevelt Babbitt--a decorative boy of seventeen.\nTinka--Katherine--still a baby at ten, with radiant red hair and a thin\nskin which hinted of too much candy and too many ice cream sodas.\nBabbitt did not show his vague irritation as he tramped in. He really\ndisliked being a family tyrant, and his nagging was as meaningless as it\nwas frequent. He shouted at Tinka, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, kittiedoolie!\xe2\x80\x9d It was the only\npet name in his vocabulary, except the \xe2\x80\x9cdear\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chon.\xe2\x80\x9d with which he\nrecognized his wife, and he flung it at Tinka every morning.\n\nHe gulped a cup of coffee in the hope of pacifying his stomach and his\nsoul. His stomach ceased to feel as though it did not belong to him, but\nVerona began to be conscientious and annoying, and abruptly there\nreturned to Babbitt the doubts regarding life and families and business\nwhich had clawed at him when his dream-life and the slim fairy girl had\nfled.\n\nVerona had for six months been filing-clerk at the Gruensberg Leather\nCompany offices, with a prospect of becoming secretary to Mr. Gruensberg\nand thus, as Babbitt defined it, \xe2\x80\x9cgetting some good out of your\nexpensive college education till you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to marry and settle down.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut now said Verona: \xe2\x80\x9cFather! I was talking to a classmate of mine\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s working for the Associated Charities--oh, Dad, there\xe2\x80\x99s the\nsweetest little babies that come to the milk-station there!--and I feel\nas though I ought to be doing something worth while like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean \xe2\x80\x98worth while\xe2\x80\x99? If you get to be Gruensberg\xe2\x80\x99s\nsecretary--and maybe you would, if you kept up your shorthand and didn\xe2\x80\x99t\ngo sneaking off to concerts and talk-fests every evening--I guess you\xe2\x80\x99ll\nfind thirty-five or forty bones a week worth while!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, but--oh, I want to--contribute-- I wish I were working in a\nsettlement-house. I wonder if I could get one of the department-stores\nto let me put in a welfare-department with a nice rest-room and chintzes\nand wicker chairs and so on and so forth. Or I could--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you look here! The first thing you got to understand is that all\nthis uplift and flipflop and settlement-work and recreation is nothing\nin God\xe2\x80\x99s world but the entering wedge for socialism. The sooner a man\nlearns he isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be coddled, and he needn\xe2\x80\x99t expect a lot of free\ngrub and, uh, all these free classes and flipflop and doodads for his\nkids unless he earns \xe2\x80\x99em, why, the sooner he\xe2\x80\x99ll get on the job and\nproduce--produce--produce! That\xe2\x80\x99s what the country needs, and not all\nthis fancy stuff that just enfeebles the will-power of the working man\nand gives his kids a lot of notions above their class. And you--if you\xe2\x80\x99d\ntend to business instead of fooling and fussing-- All the time! When I\nwas a young man I made up my mind what I wanted to do, and stuck to it\nthrough thick and thin, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m where I am to-day, and-- Myra!\nWhat do you let the girl chop the toast up into these dinky little\nchunks for? Can\xe2\x80\x99t get your fist onto \xe2\x80\x99em. Half cold, anyway!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTed Babbitt, junior in the great East Side High School, had been making\nhiccup-like sounds of interruption. He blurted now, \xe2\x80\x9cSay, Rone, you\ngoing to--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVerona whirled. \xe2\x80\x9cTed! Will you kindly not interrupt us when we\xe2\x80\x99re\ntalking about serious matters!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAw punk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ted judicially. \xe2\x80\x9cEver since somebody slipped up and let\nyou out of college, Ammonia, you been pulling these nut conversations\nabout what-nots and so-on-and-so-forths. Are you going to-- I want to use\nthe car to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt snorted, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you do! May want it myself!\xe2\x80\x9d Verona protested,\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you do, Mr. Smarty! I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take it myself!\xe2\x80\x9d Tinka wailed,\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, papa, you said maybe you\xe2\x80\x99d drive us down to Rosedale!\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs.\nBabbitt, \xe2\x80\x9cCareful, Tinka, your sleeve is in the butter.\xe2\x80\x9d They glared,\nand Verona hurled, \xe2\x80\x9cTed, you\xe2\x80\x99re a perfect pig about the car!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourse you\xe2\x80\x99re not! Not a-tall!\xe2\x80\x9d Ted could be maddeningly bland. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\njust want to grab it off, right after dinner, and leave it in front of\nsome skirt\xe2\x80\x99s house all evening while you sit and gas about lite\xe2\x80\x99ature\nand the highbrows you\xe2\x80\x99re going to marry--if they only propose!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Dad oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to _ever_ let you have it! You and those beastly\nJones boys drive like maniacs. The idea of your taking the turn on\nChautauqua Place at forty miles an hour!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAw, where do you get that stuff! You\xe2\x80\x99re so darn scared of the car that\nyou drive up-hill with the emergency brake on!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not! And you-- Always talking about how much you know about motors,\nand Eunice Littlefield told me you said the battery fed the generator!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou--why, my good woman, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know a generator from a\ndifferential.\xe2\x80\x9d Not unreasonably was Ted lofty with her. He was a natural\nmechanic, a maker and tinkerer of machines; he lisped in blueprints for\nthe blueprints came.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll do now!\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt flung in mechanically, as he lighted the\ngloriously satisfying first cigar of the day and tasted the exhilarating\ndrug of the _Advocate-Times_ headlines.\n\nTed negotiated: \xe2\x80\x9cGee, honest, Rone, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take the old boat,\nbut I promised couple o\xe2\x80\x99 girls in my class I\xe2\x80\x99d drive \xe2\x80\x99em down to the\nrehearsal of the school chorus, and, gee, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to, but a\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s got to keep his social engagements.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, upon my word! You and your social engagements! In high school!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, ain\xe2\x80\x99t we select since we went to that hen college! Let me tell you\nthere isn\xe2\x80\x99t a private school in the state that\xe2\x80\x99s got as swell a bunch as\nwe got in Gamma Digamma this year. There\xe2\x80\x99s two fellows that their dads\nare millionaires. Say, gee, I ought to have a car of my own, like lots\nof the fellows.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt almost rose. \xe2\x80\x9cA car of your own! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you want a yacht, and a\nhouse and lot? That pretty nearly takes the cake! A boy that can\xe2\x80\x99t pass\nhis Latin examinations, like any other boy ought to, and he expects me\nto give him a motor-car, and I suppose a chauffeur, and an aeroplane\nmaybe, as a reward for the hard work he puts in going to the movies with\nEunice Littlefield! Well, when you see me giving you--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSomewhat later, after diplomacies, Ted persuaded Verona to admit that\nshe was merely going to the Armory, that evening, to see the dog and cat\nshow. She was then, Ted planned, to park the car in front of the\ncandy-store across from the Armory and he would pick it up. There were\nmasterly arrangements regarding leaving the key, and having the gasoline\ntank filled; and passionately, devotees of the Great God Motor, they\nhymned the patch on the spare inner-tube, and the lost jack-handle.\n\nTheir truce dissolving, Ted observed that her friends were \xe2\x80\x9ca scream of\na bunch--stuck-up gabby four-flushers.\xe2\x80\x9d His friends, she indicated, were\n\xe2\x80\x9cdisgusting imitation sports, and horrid little shrieking ignorant\ngirls.\xe2\x80\x9d Further: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s disgusting of you to smoke cigarettes, and so on\nand so forth, and those clothes you\xe2\x80\x99ve got on this morning, they\xe2\x80\x99re too\nutterly ridiculous--honestly, simply disgusting.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTed balanced over to the low beveled mirror in the buffet, regarded his\ncharms, and smirked. His suit, the latest thing in Old Eli Togs, was\nskin-tight, with skimpy trousers to the tops of his glaring tan boots, a\nchorus-man waistline, pattern of an agitated check, and across the back\na belt which belted nothing. His scarf was an enormous black silk wad.\nHis flaxen hair was ice-smooth, pasted back without parting. When he\nwent to school he would add a cap with a long vizor like a shovel-blade.\nProudest of all was his waistcoat, saved for, begged for, plotted for; a\nreal Fancy Vest of fawn with polka dots of a decayed red, the points\nastoundingly long. On the lower edge of it he wore a high-school\nbutton, a class button, and a fraternity pin.\n\nAnd none of it mattered. He was supple and swift and flushed; his eyes\n(which he believed to be cynical) were candidly eager. But he was not\nover-gentle. He waved his hand at poor dumpy Verona and drawled: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\nguess we\xe2\x80\x99re pretty ridiculous and disgusticulus, and I rather guess our\nnew necktie is some smear!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt barked: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is! And while you\xe2\x80\x99re admiring yourself, let me tell\nyou it might add to your manly beauty if you wiped some of that egg off\nyour mouth!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVerona giggled, momentary victor in the greatest of Great Wars, which is\nthe family war. Ted looked at her hopelessly, then shrieked at Tinka:\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the love o\xe2\x80\x99 Pete, quit pouring the whole sugar bowl on your corn\nflakes!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen Verona and Ted were gone and Tinka upstairs, Babbitt groaned to his\nwife: \xe2\x80\x9cNice family, I must say! I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to be any baa-lamb, and\nmaybe I\xe2\x80\x99m a little cross-grained at breakfast sometimes, but the way\nthey go on jab-jab-jabbering, I simply can\xe2\x80\x99t stand it. I swear, I feel\nlike going off some place where I can get a little peace. I do think\nafter a man\xe2\x80\x99s spent his lifetime trying to give his kids a chance and a\ndecent education, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty discouraging to hear them all the time\nscrapping like a bunch of hyenas and never--and never-- Curious; here in\nthe paper it says-- Never silent for one mom-- Seen the morning paper\nyet?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d In twenty-three years of married life, Mrs. Babbitt had seen\nthe paper before her husband just sixty-seven times.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLots of news. Terrible big tornado in the South. Hard luck, all right.\nBut this, say, this is corking! Beginning of the end for those fellows!\nNew York Assembly has passed some bills that ought to completely outlaw\nthe socialists! And there\xe2\x80\x99s an elevator-runners\xe2\x80\x99 strike in New York and\na lot of college boys are taking their places. That\xe2\x80\x99s the stuff! And a\nmass-meeting in Birmingham\xe2\x80\x99s demanded that this Mick agitator, this\nfellow De Valera, be deported. Dead right, by golly! All these agitators\npaid with German gold anyway. And we got no business interfering with\nthe Irish or any other foreign government. Keep our hands strictly off.\nAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s another well-authenticated rumor from Russia that Lenin is\ndead. That\xe2\x80\x99s fine. It\xe2\x80\x99s beyond me why we don\xe2\x80\x99t just step in there and\nkick those Bolshevik cusses out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Babbitt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it says here a fellow was inaugurated mayor in overalls--a\npreacher, too! What do you think of that!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph! Well!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe searched for an attitude, but neither as a Republican, a\nPresbyterian, an Elk, nor a real-estate broker did he have any doctrine\nabout preacher-mayors laid down for him, so he grunted and went on. She\nlooked sympathetic and did not hear a word. Later she would read the\nheadlines, the society columns, and the department-store advertisements.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you know about this! Charley McKelvey still doing the sassiety\nstunt as heavy as ever. Here\xe2\x80\x99s what that gushy woman reporter says about\nlast night:\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n     Never is Society with the big, big S more flattered than when they\n     are bidden to partake of good cheer at the distinguished and\n     hospitable residence of Mr. and Mrs. Charles L. McKelvey as they\n     were last night. Set in its spacious lawns and landscaping, one of\n     the notable sights crowning Royal Ridge, but merry and homelike\n     despite its mighty stone walls and its vast rooms famed for their\n     decoration, their home was thrown open last night for a dance in\n     honor of Mrs. McKelvey\xe2\x80\x99s notable guest, Miss J. Sneeth of\n     Washington. The wide hall is so generous in its proportions that it\n     made a perfect ballroom, its hardwood floor reflecting the charming\n     pageant above its polished surface. Even the delights of dancing\n     paled before the alluring opportunities for t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaates that\n     invited the soul to loaf in the long library before the baronial\n     fireplace, or in the drawing-room with its deep comfy armchairs,\n     its shaded lamps just made for a sly whisper of pretty nothings all\n     a deux; or even in the billiard room where one could take a cue\n     and show a prowess at still another game than that sponsored by\n     Cupid and Terpsichore.\n\nThere was more, a great deal more, in the best urban journalistic style\nof Miss Elnora Pearl Bates, the popular society editor of the\n_Advocate-Times_. But Babbitt could not abide it. He grunted. He\nwrinkled the newspaper. He protested: \xe2\x80\x9cCan you beat it! I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to\nhand a lot of credit to Charley McKelvey. When we were in college\ntogether, he was just as hard up as any of us, and he\xe2\x80\x99s made a million\ngood bucks out of contracting and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been any dishonester or bought\nany more city councils than was necessary. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a good house of\nhis--though it ain\xe2\x80\x99t any \xe2\x80\x98mighty stone walls\xe2\x80\x99 and it ain\xe2\x80\x99t worth the\nninety thousand it cost him. But when it comes to talking as though\nCharley McKelvey and all that booze-hoisting set of his are any blooming\nbunch of of, of Vanderbilts, why, it makes me tired!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTimidly from Mrs. Babbitt: \xe2\x80\x9cI would like to see the inside of their\nhouse though. It must be lovely. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been inside.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have! Lots of--couple of times. To see Chaz about business\ndeals, in the evening. It\xe2\x80\x99s not so much. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t _want_ to go there\nto dinner with that gang of, of high-binders. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet I make a\nwhole lot more money than some of those tin-horns that spend all they\ngot on dress-suits and haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a decent suit of underwear to their\nname! Hey! What do you think of this!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMrs. Babbitt was strangely unmoved by the tidings from the Real Estate\nand Building column of the _Advocate-Times_:\n\n                Ashtabula Street, 496--J. K. Dawson to\n               Thomas Mullally, April 17, 15.7 \xc3\x97 112.2,\n                    mtg. $4000................ Nom.\n\nAnd this morning Babbitt was too disquieted to entertain her with items\nfrom Mechanics\xe2\x80\x99 Liens, Mortgages Recorded, and Contracts Awarded. He\nrose. As he looked at her his eyebrows seemed shaggier than usual.\nSuddenly:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, maybe-- Kind of shame to not keep in touch with folks like the\nMcKelveys. We might try inviting them to dinner, some evening. Oh,\nthunder, let\xe2\x80\x99s not waste our good time thinking about \xe2\x80\x99em! Our little\nbunch has a lot liver times than all those plutes. Just compare a real\nhuman like you with these neurotic birds like Lucile McKelvey--all\nhighbrow talk and dressed up like a plush horse! You\xe2\x80\x99re a great old\ngirl, hon.!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe covered his betrayal of softness with a complaining: \xe2\x80\x9cSay, don\xe2\x80\x99t let\nTinka go and eat any more of that poison nut-fudge. For Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\ntry to keep her from ruining her digestion. I tell you, most folks don\xe2\x80\x99t\nappreciate how important it is to have a good digestion and regular\nhabits. Be back \xe2\x80\x99bout usual time, I guess.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe kissed her--he didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite kiss her--he laid unmoving lips against\nher unflushing cheek. He hurried out to the garage, muttering: \xe2\x80\x9cLord,\nwhat a family! And now Myra is going to get pathetic on me because we\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t train with this millionaire outfit. Oh, Lord, sometimes I\xe2\x80\x99d like\nto quit the whole game. And the office worry and detail just as bad. And\nI act cranky and-- I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to, but I get-- So darn tired!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nI\n\n\nTo George F. Babbitt, as to most prosperous citizens of Zenith, his\nmotor car was poetry and tragedy, love and heroism. The office was his\npirate ship but the car his perilous excursion ashore.\n\nAmong the tremendous crises of each day none was more dramatic than\nstarting the engine. It was slow on cold mornings; there was the long,\nanxious whirr of the starter; and sometimes he had to drip ether into\nthe cocks of the cylinders, which was so very interesting that at lunch\nhe would chronicle it drop by drop, and orally calculate how much each\ndrop had cost him.\n\nThis morning he was darkly prepared to find something wrong, and he felt\nbelittled when the mixture exploded sweet and strong, and the car didn\xe2\x80\x99t\neven brush the door-jamb, gouged and splintery with many bruisings by\nfenders, as he backed out of the garage. He was confused. He shouted\n\xe2\x80\x9cMorning!\xe2\x80\x9d to Sam Doppelbrau with more cordiality than he had intended.\n\nBabbitt\xe2\x80\x99s green and white Dutch Colonial house was one of three in that\nblock on Chatham Road. To the left of it was the residence of Mr. Samuel\nDoppelbrau, secretary of an excellent firm of bathroom-fixture jobbers.\nHis was a comfortable house with no architectural manners whatever; a\nlarge wooden box with a squat tower, a broad porch, and glossy paint\nyellow as a yolk. Babbitt disapproved of Mr. and Mrs. Doppelbrau as\n\xe2\x80\x9cBohemian.\xe2\x80\x9d From their house came midnight music and obscene laughter;\nthere were neighborhood rumors of bootlegged whisky and fast motor\nrides. They furnished Babbitt with many happy evenings of discussion,\nduring which he announced firmly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not straitlaced, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\nseeing a fellow throw in a drink once in a while, but when it comes to\ndeliberately trying to get away with a lot of hell-raising all the while\nlike the Doppelbraus do, it\xe2\x80\x99s too rich for my blood!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn the other side of Babbitt lived Howard Littlefield, Ph.D., in a\nstrictly modern house whereof the lower part was dark red tapestry\nbrick, with a leaded oriel, the upper part of pale stucco like spattered\nclay, and the roof red-tiled. Littlefield was the Great Scholar of the\nneighborhood; the authority on everything in the world except babies,\ncooking, and motors. He was a Bachelor of Arts of Blodgett College, and\na Doctor of Philosophy in economics of Yale. He was the\nemployment-manager and publicity-counsel of the Zenith Street Traction\nCompany. He could, on ten hours\xe2\x80\x99 notice, appear before the board of\naldermen or the state legislature and prove, absolutely, with figures\nall in rows and with precedents from Poland and New Zealand, that the\nstreet-car company loved the Public and yearned over its employees; that\nall its stock was owned by Widows and Orphans; and that whatever it\ndesired to do would benefit property-owners by increasing rental values,\nand help the poor by lowering rents. All his acquaintances turned to\nLittlefield when they desired to know the date of the battle of\nSaragossa, the definition of the word \xe2\x80\x9csabotage,\xe2\x80\x9d the future of the\nGerman mark, the translation of \xe2\x80\x9c_hinc ill\xc3\xa6 lachrim\xc3\xa6_\xe2\x80\x9d or the number of\nproducts of coal tar. He awed Babbitt by confessing that he often sat up\ntill midnight reading the figures and footnotes in Government reports,\nor skimming (with amusement at the author\xe2\x80\x99s mistakes) the latest volumes\nof chemistry, archaeology, and ichthyology.\n\nBut Littlefield\xe2\x80\x99s great value was as a spiritual example. Despite his\nstrange learnings he was as strict a Presbyterian and as firm a\nRepublican as George F. Babbitt. He confirmed the business men in the\nfaith. Where they knew only by passionate instinct that their system of\nindustry and manners was perfect, Dr. Howard Littlefield proved it to\nthem, out of history, economics, and the confessions of reformed\nradicals.\n\nBabbitt had a good deal of honest pride in being the neighbor of such a\nsavant, and in Ted\xe2\x80\x99s intimacy with Eunice Littlefield. At sixteen Eunice\nwas interested in no statistics save those regarding the ages and\nsalaries of motion-picture stars, but--as Babbitt definitively put\nit--\xe2\x80\x9cshe was her father\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe difference between a light man like Sam Doppelbrau and a really fine\ncharacter like Littlefield was revealed in their appearances. Doppelbrau\nwas disturbingly young for a man of forty-eight. He wore his derby on\nthe back of his head, and his red face was wrinkled with meaningless\nlaughter. But Littlefield was old for a man of forty-two. He was tall,\nbroad, thick; his gold-rimmed spectacles were engulfed in the folds of\nhis long face; his hair was a tossed mass of greasy blackness; he puffed\nand rumbled as he talked; his Phi Beta Kappa key shone against a spotty\nblack vest; he smelled of old pipes; he was altogether funereal and\narchidiaconal; and to real-estate brokerage and the jobbing of\nbathroom-fixtures he added an aroma of sanctity.\n\nThis morning he was in front of his house, inspecting the grass parking\nbetween the curb and the broad cement sidewalk. Babbitt stopped his car\nand leaned out to shout \xe2\x80\x9cMornin\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d Littlefield lumbered over and stood\nwith one foot up on the running-board.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Babbitt, lighting--illegally early--his second\ncigar of the day.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s a mighty fine morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Littlefield.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpring coming along fast now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s real spring now, all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Littlefield.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill cold nights, though. Had to have a couple blankets, on the\nsleeping-porch last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any too warm last night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Littlefield.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate we\xe2\x80\x99ll have any more real cold weather now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but still, there was snow at Tiflis, Montana, yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nScholar, \xe2\x80\x9cand you remember the blizzard they had out West three days\nago--thirty inches of snow at Greeley, Colorado--and two years ago we\nhad a snow-squall right here in Zenith on the twenty-fifth of April.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that a fact! Say, old man, what do you think about the Republican\ncandidate? Who\xe2\x80\x99ll they nominate for president? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it\xe2\x80\x99s\nabout time we had a real business administration?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my opinion, what the country needs, first and foremost, is a good,\nsound, business-like conduct of its affairs. What we need is--a business\nadministration!\xe2\x80\x9d said Littlefield.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to hear you say that! I certainly am glad to hear you say\nthat! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how you\xe2\x80\x99d feel about it, with all your associations\nwith colleges and so on, and I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you feel that way. What the\ncountry needs--just at this present juncture--is neither a college\npresident nor a lot of monkeying with foreign affairs, but a\ngood--sound--economical--business--administration, that will give us a\nchance to have something like a decent turnover.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t generally realized that even in China the schoolmen are\ngiving way to more practical men, and of course you can see what that\nimplies.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that a fact! Well, well!\xe2\x80\x9d breathed Babbitt, feeling much calmer, and\nmuch happier about the way things were going in the world. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s\nbeen nice to stop and parleyvoo a second. Guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get down to\nthe office now and sting a few clients. Well, so long, old man. See you\nto-night. So long.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nII\n\nThey had labored, these solid citizens. Twenty years before, the hill\non which Floral Heights was spread, with its bright roofs and immaculate\nturf and amazing comfort, had been a wilderness of rank second-growth\nelms and oaks and maples. Along the precise streets were still a few\nwooded vacant lots, and the fragment of an old orchard. It was brilliant\nto-day; the apple boughs were lit with fresh leaves like torches of\ngreen fire. The first white of cherry blossoms flickered down a gully,\nand robins clamored.\n\nBabbitt sniffed the earth, chuckled at the hysteric robins as he would\nhave chuckled at kittens or at a comic movie. He was, to the eye, the\nperfect office-going executive--a well-fed man in a correct brown soft\nhat and frameless spectacles, smoking a large cigar, driving a good\nmotor along a semisuburban parkway. But in him was some genius of\nauthentic love for his neighborhood, his city, his clan. The winter was\nover; the time was come for the building, the visible growth, which to\nhim was glory. He lost his dawn depression; he was ruddily cheerful when\nhe stopped on Smith Street to leave the brown trousers, and to have the\ngasoline-tank filled.\n\nThe familiarity of the rite fortified him: the sight of the tall red\niron gasoline-pump, the hollow-tile and terra-cotta garage, the window\nfull of the most agreeable accessories--shiny casings, spark-plugs with\nimmaculate porcelain jackets, tire-chains of gold and silver. He was\nflattered by the friendliness with which Sylvester Moon, dirtiest and\nmost skilled of motor mechanics, came out to serve him. \xe2\x80\x9cMornin\xe2\x80\x99, Mr.\nBabbitt!\xe2\x80\x9d said Moon, and Babbitt felt himself a person of importance,\none whose name even busy garagemen remembered--not one of these\ncheap-sports flying around in flivvers. He admired the ingenuity of the\nautomatic dial, clicking off gallon by gallon; admired the smartness of\nthe sign: \xe2\x80\x9cA fill in time saves getting stuck--gas to-day 31 cents\xe2\x80\x9d;\nadmired the rhythmic gurgle of the gasoline as it flowed into the tank,\nand the mechanical regularity with which Moon turned the handle.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much we takin\xe2\x80\x99 to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Moon, in a manner which combined the\nindependence of the great specialist, the friendliness of a familiar\ngossip, and respect for a man of weight in the community, like George F.\nBabbitt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFill \xe2\x80\x99er up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho you rootin\xe2\x80\x99 for for Republican candidate, Mr. Babbitt?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too early to make any predictions yet. After all, there\xe2\x80\x99s still a\ngood month and two weeks--no, three weeks--must be almost three\nweeks--well, there\xe2\x80\x99s more than six weeks in all before the Republican\nconvention, and I feel a fellow ought to keep an open mind and give all\nthe candidates a show--look \xe2\x80\x99em all over and size \xe2\x80\x99em up, and then\ndecide carefully.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fact, Mr. Babbitt.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you--and my stand on this is just the same as it was four\nyears ago, and eight years ago, and it\xe2\x80\x99ll be my stand four years from\nnow--yes, and eight years from now! What I tell everybody, and it can\xe2\x80\x99t\nbe too generally understood, is that what we need first, last, and all\nthe time is a good, sound business administration!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy golly, that\xe2\x80\x99s right!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do those front tires look to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine! Fine! Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be much work for garages if everybody looked after\ntheir car the way you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I do try and have some sense about it.\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt paid his bill,\nsaid adequately, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, keep the change,\xe2\x80\x9d and drove off in an ecstasy of\nhonest self-appreciation. It was with the manner of a Good Samaritan\nthat he shouted at a respectable-looking man who was waiting for a\ntrolley car, \xe2\x80\x9cHave a lift?\xe2\x80\x9d As the man climbed in Babbitt condescended,\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing clear down-town? Whenever I see a fellow waiting for a trolley, I\nalways make it a practice to give him a lift--unless, of course, he\nlooks like a bum.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWish there were more folks that were so generous with their machines,\xe2\x80\x9d\ndutifully said the victim of benevolence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, \xe2\x80\x99tain\xe2\x80\x99t a question of generosity, hardly. Fact, I always\nfeel-- I was saying to my son just the other night--it\xe2\x80\x99s a fellow\xe2\x80\x99s duty\nto share the good things of this world with his neighbors, and it gets\nmy goat when a fellow gets stuck on himself and goes around tooting his\nhorn merely because he\xe2\x80\x99s charitable.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe victim seemed unable to find the right answer. Babbitt boomed on:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty punk service the Company giving us on these carlines. Nonsense\nto only run the Portland Road cars once every seven minutes. Fellow gets\nmighty cold on a winter morning, waiting on a street corner with the\nwind nipping at his ankles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right. The Street Car Company don\xe2\x80\x99t care a damn what kind of a\ndeal they give us. Something ought to happen to \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt was alarmed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut still, of course it won\xe2\x80\x99t do to just keep\nknocking the Traction Company and not realize the difficulties they\xe2\x80\x99re\noperating under, like these cranks that want municipal ownership. The\nway these workmen hold up the Company for high wages is simply a crime,\nand of course the burden falls on you and me that have to pay a\nseven-cent fare! Fact, there\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable service on all their\nlines--considering.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--\xe2\x80\x9d uneasily.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDarn fine morning,\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt explained. \xe2\x80\x9cSpring coming along fast.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s real spring now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe victim had no originality, no wit, and Babbitt fell into a great\nsilence and devoted himself to the game of beating trolley cars to the\ncorner: a spurt, a tail-chase, nervous speeding between the huge yellow\nside of the trolley and the jagged row of parked motors, shooting past\njust as the trolley stopped--a rare game and valiant.\n\nAnd all the while he was conscious of the loveliness of Zenith. For\nweeks together he noticed nothing but clients and the vexing To Rent\nsigns of rival brokers. To-day, in mysterious malaise, he raged or\nrejoiced with equal nervous swiftness, and to-day the light of spring\nwas so winsome that he lifted his head and saw.\n\nHe admired each district along his familiar route to the office: The\nbungalows and shrubs and winding irregular driveways of Floral Heights.\nThe one-story shops on Smith Street, a glare of plate-glass and new\nyellow brick; groceries and laundries and drug-stores to supply the more\nimmediate needs of East Side housewives. The market gardens in Dutch\nHollow, their shanties patched with corrugated iron and stolen doors.\nBillboards with crimson goddesses nine feet tall advertising cinema\nfilms, pipe tobacco, and talcum powder. The old \xe2\x80\x9cmansions\xe2\x80\x9d along Ninth\nStreet, S.E., like aged dandies in filthy linen; wooden castles turned\ninto boarding-houses, with muddy walks and rusty hedges, jostled by\nfast-intruding garages, cheap apartment-houses, and fruit-stands\nconducted by bland, sleek Athenians. Across the belt of railroad-tracks,\nfactories with high-perched water-tanks and tall stacks--factories\nproducing condensed milk, paper boxes, lighting-fixtures, motor cars.\nThen the business center, the thickening darting traffic, the crammed\ntrolleys unloading, and high doorways of marble and polished granite.\n\nIt was big--and Babbitt respected bigness in anything; in mountains,\njewels, muscles, wealth, or words. He was, for a spring-enchanted\nmoment, the lyric and almost unselfish lover of Zenith. He thought of\nthe outlying factory suburbs; of the Chaloosa River with its strangely\neroded banks; of the orchard-dappled Tonawanda Hills to the North, and\nall the fat dairy land and big barns and comfortable herds. As he\ndropped his passenger he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cGosh, I feel pretty good this\nmorning!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nIII\n\nEpochal as starting the car was the drama of parking it before he\nentered his office. As he turned from Oberlin Avenue round the corner\ninto Third Street, N.E., he peered ahead for a space in the line of\nparked cars. He angrily just missed a space as a rival driver slid into\nit. Ahead, another car was leaving the curb, and Babbitt slowed up,\nholding out his hand to the cars pressing on him from behind, agitatedly\nmotioning an old woman to go ahead, avoiding a truck which bore down on\nhim from one side. With front wheels nicking the wrought-steel bumper of\nthe car in front, he stopped, feverishly cramped his steering-wheel,\nslid back into the vacant space and, with eighteen inches of room,\nman\xc5\x93uvered to bring the car level with the curb. It was a virile\nadventure masterfully executed. With satisfaction he locked a\nthief-proof steel wedge on the front wheel, and crossed the street to\nhis real-estate office on the ground floor of the Reeves Building.\n\nThe Reeves Building was as fireproof as a rock and as efficient as a\ntypewriter; fourteen stories of yellow pressed brick, with clean,\nupright, unornamented lines. It was filled with the offices of lawyers,\ndoctors, agents for machinery, for emery wheels, for wire fencing, for\nmining-stock. Their gold signs shone on the windows. The entrance was\ntoo modern to be flamboyant with pillars; it was quiet, shrewd, neat.\nAlong the Third Street side were a Western Union Telegraph Office, the\nBlue Delft Candy Shop, Shotwell\xe2\x80\x99s Stationery Shop, and the\nBabbitt-Thompson Realty Company.\n\nBabbitt could have entered his office from the street, as customers did,\nbut it made him feel an insider to go through the corridor of the\nbuilding and enter by the back door. Thus he was greeted by the\nvillagers.\n\nThe little unknown people who inhabited the Reeves Building\ncorridors--elevator-runners, starter, engineers, superintendent, and the\ndoubtful-looking lame man who conducted the news and cigar stand--were\nin no way city-dwellers. They were rustics, living in a constricted\nvalley, interested only in one another and in The Building. Their Main\nStreet was the entrance hall, with its stone floor, severe marble\nceiling, and the inner windows of the shops. The liveliest place on the\nstreet was the Reeves Building Barber Shop, but this was also Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s\none embarrassment. Himself, he patronized the glittering Pompeian Barber\nShop in the Hotel Thornleigh, and every time he passed the Reeves\nshop--ten times a day, a hundred times--he felt untrue to his own\nvillage.\n\nNow, as one of the squirearchy, greeted with honorable salutations by\nthe villagers, he marched into his office, and peace and dignity were\nupon him, and the morning\xe2\x80\x99s dissonances all unheard.\n\nThey were heard again, immediately.\n\nStanley Graff, the outside salesman, was talking on the telephone with\ntragic lack of that firm manner which disciplines clients: \xe2\x80\x9cSay, uh, I\nthink I got just the house that would suit you--the Percival House, in\nLinton.... Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it. Well, how\xe2\x80\x99d it strike you?... Huh?...\nOh,\xe2\x80\x9d irresolutely, \xe2\x80\x9coh, I see.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs Babbitt marched into his private room, a coop with semi-partition of\noak and frosted glass, at the back of the office, he reflected how hard\nit was to find employees who had his own faith that he was going to make\nsales.\n\nThere were nine members of the staff, besides Babbitt and his partner\nand father-in-law, Henry Thompson, who rarely came to the office. The\nnine were Stanley Graff, the outside salesman--a youngish man given to\ncigarettes and the playing of pool; old Mat Penniman, general utility\nman, collector of rents and salesman of insurance--broken, silent, gray;\na mystery, reputed to have been a \xe2\x80\x9ccrack\xe2\x80\x9d real-estate man with a firm of\nhis own in haughty Brooklyn; Chester Kirby Laylock, resident salesman\nout at the Glen Oriole acreage development--an enthusiastic person with\na silky mustache and much family; Miss Theresa McGoun, the swift and\nrather pretty stenographer; Miss Wilberta Bannigan, the thick, slow,\nlaborious accountant and file-clerk; and four freelance part-time\ncommission salesmen.\n\nAs he looked from his own cage into the main room Babbitt mourned,\n\xe2\x80\x9cMcGoun\xe2\x80\x99s a good stenog., smart\xe2\x80\x99s a whip, but Stan Graff and all those\nbums--\xe2\x80\x9d The zest of the spring morning was smothered in the stale office\nair.\n\nNormally he admired the office, with a pleased surprise that he should\nhave created this sure lovely thing; normally he was stimulated by the\nclean newness of it and the air of bustle; but to-day it seemed\nflat--the tiled floor, like a bathroom, the ocher-colored metal ceiling,\nthe faded maps on the hard plaster walls, the chairs of varnished pale\noak, the desks and filing-cabinets of steel painted in olive drab. It\nwas a vault, a steel chapel where loafing and laughter were raw sin.\n\nHe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even any satisfaction in the new water-cooler! And it was the\nvery best of water-coolers, up-to-date, scientific, and right-thinking.\nIt had cost a great deal of money (in itself a virtue). It possessed a\nnon-conducting fiber ice-container, a porcelain water-jar (guaranteed\nhygienic), a dripless non-clogging sanitary faucet, and machine-painted\ndecorations in two tones of gold. He looked down the relentless stretch\nof tiled floor at the water-cooler, and assured himself that no tenant\nof the Reeves Building had a more expensive one, but he could not\nrecapture the feeling of social superiority it had given him. He\nastoundingly grunted, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to beat it off to the woods right now.\nAnd loaf all day. And go to Gunch\xe2\x80\x99s again to-night, and play poker, and\ncuss as much as I feel like, and drink a hundred and nine-thousand\nbottles of beer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe sighed; he read through his mail; he shouted \xe2\x80\x9cMsgoun,\xe2\x80\x9d which meant\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss McGoun\xe2\x80\x9d; and began to dictate.\n\nThis was his own version of his first letter:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOmar Gribble, send it to his office, Miss McGoun, yours of twentieth to\nhand and in reply would say look here, Gribble, I\xe2\x80\x99m awfully afraid if we\ngo on shilly-shallying like this we\xe2\x80\x99ll just naturally lose the Allen\nsale, I had Allen up on carpet day before yesterday and got right down\nto cases and think I can assure you--uh, uh, no, change that: all my\nexperience indicates he is all right, means to do business, looked into\nhis financial record which is fine--that sentence seems to be a little\nballed up, Miss McGoun; make a couple sentences out of it if you have\nto, period, new paragraph.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is perfectly willing to pro rate the special assessment and strikes\nme, am dead sure there will be no difficulty in getting him to pay for\ntitle insurance, so now for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake let\xe2\x80\x99s get busy--no, make that:\nso now let\xe2\x80\x99s go to it and get down--no, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough--you can tie those\nsentences up a little better when you type \xe2\x80\x99em, Miss McGoun--your\nsincerely, etcetera.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis is the version of his letter which he received, typed, from Miss\nMcGoun that afternoon:\n\n                        BABBITT-THOMPSON REALTY CO.\n                        Homes for Folks\n                        Reeves Bldg., Oberlin Avenue & 3d St., N.E.\n                        Zenith\n\nOmar Gribble, Esq.,\n576 North American Building,\nZenith.\n\n     Dear Mr. Gribble:\n\n     Your letter of the twentieth to hand. I must say I\xe2\x80\x99m awfully afraid\n     that if we go on shilly-shallying like this we\xe2\x80\x99ll just naturally\n     lose the Allen sale. I had Allen up on the carpet day before\n     yesterday, and got right down to cases. All my experience indicates\n     that he means to do business. I have also looked into his financial\n     record, which is fine.\n\n     He is perfectly willing to pro rate the special assessment and\n     there will be no difficulty in getting him to pay for title\n     insurance.\n\n     _So let\xe2\x80\x99s go!_\n\n                           Yours sincerely,\n\n\n\nAs he read and signed it, in his correct flowing business-college hand,\nBabbitt reflected, \xe2\x80\x9cNow that\xe2\x80\x99s a good, strong letter, and clear\xe2\x80\x99s a\nbell. Now what the-- I never told McGoun to make a third paragraph there!\nWish she\xe2\x80\x99d quit trying to improve on my dictation! But what I can\xe2\x80\x99t\nunderstand is: why can\xe2\x80\x99t Stan Graff or Chet Laylock write a letter like\nthat? With punch! With a kick!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe most important thing he dictated that morning was the fortnightly\nform-letter, to be mimeographed and sent out to a thousand \xe2\x80\x9cprospects.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIt was diligently imitative of the best literary models of the day; of\nheart-to-heart-talk advertisements, \xe2\x80\x9csales-pulling\xe2\x80\x9d letters, discourses\non the \xe2\x80\x9cdevelopment of Will-power,\xe2\x80\x9d and hand-shaking house-organs, as\nrichly poured forth by the new school of Poets of Business. He had\npainfully written out a first draft, and he intoned it now like a poet\ndelicate and distrait:\n\n     SAY, OLD MAN!\n\n     I just want to know can I do you a whaleuva favor? Honest! No\n     kidding! I know you\xe2\x80\x99re interested in getting a house, not merely a\n     place where you hang up the old bonnet but a love-nest for the wife\n     and kiddies--and maybe for the flivver out beyant (be sure and\n     spell that b-e-y-a-n-t, Miss McGoun) the spud garden. Say, did you\n     ever stop to think that we\xe2\x80\x99re here to save you trouble? That\xe2\x80\x99s how\n     we make a living--folks don\xe2\x80\x99t pay us for our lovely beauty! Now\n     take a look:\n\n     Sit right down at the handsome carved mahogany escritoire and shoot\n     us in a line telling us just what you want, and if we can find it\n     we\xe2\x80\x99ll come hopping down your lane with the good tidings, and if we\n     can\xe2\x80\x99t, we won\xe2\x80\x99t bother you. To save your time, just fill out the\n     blank enclosed. On request will also send blank regarding store\n     properties in Floral Heights, Silver Grove, Linton, Bellevue, and\n     all East Side residential districts.\n\n                          Yours for service,\n\n     P.S.--Just a hint of some plums we can pick for you--some genuine\n     bargains that came in to-day:\n\n     SILVER GROVE.--Cute four-room California bungalow, a.m.i., garage,\n     dandy shade tree, swell neighborhood, handy car line. $3700, $780\n     down and balance liberal, Babbitt-Thompson terms, cheaper than\n     rent.\n\n     DORCHESTER.--A corker! Artistic two-family house, all oak trim,\n     parquet floors, lovely gas log, big porches, colonial, HEATED\n     ALL-WEATHER GARAGE, a bargain at $11,250.\n\nDictation over, with its need of sitting and thinking instead of\nbustling around and making a noise and really doing something, Babbitt\nsat creakily back in his revolving desk-chair and beamed on Miss McGoun.\nHe was conscious of her as a girl, of black bobbed hair against demure\ncheeks. A longing which was indistinguishable from loneliness enfeebled\nhim. While she waited, tapping a long, precise pencil-point on the\ndesk-tablet, he half identified her with the fairy girl of his dreams.\nHe imagined their eyes meeting with terrifying recognition; imagined\ntouching her lips with frightened reverence and-- She was chirping, \xe2\x80\x9cAny\nmore, Mist\xe2\x80\x99 Babbitt?\xe2\x80\x9d He grunted, \xe2\x80\x9cThat winds it up, I guess,\xe2\x80\x9d and\nturned heavily away.\n\nFor all his wandering thoughts, they had never been more intimate than\nthis. He often reflected, \xe2\x80\x9cNev\xe2\x80\x99 forget how old Jake Offutt said a wise\nbird never goes love-making in his own office or his own home. Start\ntrouble. Sure. But--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn twenty-three years of married life he had peered uneasily at every\ngraceful ankle, every soft shoulder; in thought he had treasured them;\nbut not once had he hazarded respectability by adventuring. Now, as he\ncalculated the cost of repapering the Styles house, he was restless\nagain, discontented about nothing and everything, ashamed of his\ndiscontentment, and lonely for the fairy girl.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nI\n\nIt was a morning of artistic creation. Fifteen minutes after the purple\nprose of Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s form-letter, Chester Kirby Laylock, the resident\nsalesman at Glen Oriole, came in to report a sale and submit an\nadvertisement. Babbitt disapproved of Laylock, who sang in choirs and\nwas merry at home over games of Hearts and Old Maid. He had a tenor\nvoice, wavy chestnut hair, and a mustache like a camel\xe2\x80\x99s-hair brush.\nBabbitt considered it excusable in a family-man to growl, \xe2\x80\x9cSeen this new\npicture of the kid--husky little devil, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d but Laylock\xe2\x80\x99s domestic\nconfidences were as bubbling as a girl\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, I think I got a peach of an ad for the Glen, Mr. Babbitt. Why\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t we try something in poetry? Honest, it\xe2\x80\x99d have wonderful\npulling-power. Listen:\n\n    \xe2\x80\x99Mid pleasures and palaces,\n    Wherever you may roam,\n    You just provide the little bride\n    And we\xe2\x80\x99ll provide the home.\n\nDo you get it? See--like \xe2\x80\x98Home Sweet Home.\xe2\x80\x99 Don\xe2\x80\x99t you--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, yes, hell yes, of course I get it. But-- Oh, I think we\xe2\x80\x99d\nbetter use something more dignified and forceful, like \xe2\x80\x98We lead, others\nfollow,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98Eventually, why not now?\xe2\x80\x99 Course I believe in using poetry\nand humor and all that junk when it turns the trick, but with a\nhigh-class restricted development like the Glen we better stick to the\nmore dignified approach, see how I mean? Well, I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s all, this\nmorning, Chet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nII\n\nBy a tragedy familiar to the world of art, the April enthusiasm of Chet\nLaylock served only to stimulate the talent of the older craftsman,\nGeorge F. Babbitt. He grumbled to Stanley Graff, \xe2\x80\x9cThat tan-colored voice\nof Chet\xe2\x80\x99s gets on my nerves,\xe2\x80\x9d yet he was aroused and in one swoop he\nwrote:\n\nDO YOU RESPECT YOUR LOVED ONES?\n\nWhen the last sad rites of bereavement are over, do\nyou know for certain that you have done your best for\nthe Departed? You haven\xe2\x80\x99t unless they lie in the\nCemetery Beautiful.\n\nLINDEN LANE\n\nthe only strictly up-to-date burial place in or near\nZenith, where exquisitely gardened plots look from\ndaisy-dotted hill-slopes across the smiling fields of\nDorchester.\n\nSole agents\nBABBITT-THOMPSON REALTY COMPANY\nReeves Building\n\n\n\nHe rejoiced, \xe2\x80\x9cI guess that\xe2\x80\x99ll show Chan Mott and his weedy old Wildwood\nCemetery something about modern merchandizing!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nIII\n\nHe sent Mat Penniman to the recorder\xe2\x80\x99s office to dig out the names of\nthe owners of houses which were displaying For Rent signs of other\nbrokers; he talked to a man who desired to lease a store-building for a\npool-room; he ran over the list of home-leases which were about to\nexpire; he sent Thomas Bywaters, a street-car conductor who played at\nreal estate in spare time, to call on side-street \xe2\x80\x9cprospects\xe2\x80\x9d who were\nunworthy the strategies of Stanley Graff. But he had spent his credulous\nexcitement of creation, and these routine details annoyed him. One\nmoment of heroism he had, in discovering a new way of stopping smoking.\n\nHe stopped smoking at least once a month. He went through with it like\nthe solid citizen he was: admitted the evils of tobacco, courageously\nmade resolves, laid out plans to check the vice, tapered off his\nallowance of cigars, and expounded the pleasures of virtuousness to\nevery one he met. He did everything, in fact, except stop smoking.\n\nTwo months before, by ruling out a schedule, noting down the hour and\nminute of each smoke, and ecstatically increasing the intervals between\nsmokes, he had brought himself down to three cigars a day. Then he had\nlost the schedule.\n\nA week ago he had invented a system of leaving his cigar-case\nand cigarette-box in an unused drawer at the bottom of the\ncorrespondence-file, in the outer office. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll just naturally be\nashamed to go poking in there all day long, making a fool of myself\nbefore my own employees!\xe2\x80\x9d he reasoned. By the end of three days he was\ntrained to leave his desk, walk to the file, take out and light a cigar,\nwithout knowing that he was doing it.\n\nThis morning it was revealed to him that it had been too easy to open\nthe file. Lock it, that was the thing! Inspired, he rushed out and\nlocked up his cigars, his cigarettes, and even his box of safety\nmatches; and the key to the file drawer he hid in his desk. But the\ncrusading passion of it made him so tobacco-hungry that he immediately\nrecovered the key, walked with forbidding dignity to the file, took out\na cigar and a match--\xe2\x80\x9cbut only one match; if ole cigar goes out, it\xe2\x80\x99ll\nby golly have to stay out!\xe2\x80\x9d Later, when the cigar did go out, he took\none more match from the file, and when a buyer and a seller came in for\na conference at eleven-thirty, naturally he had to offer them cigars.\nHis conscience protested, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99re smoking with them!\xe2\x80\x9d but he\nbullied it, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, shut up! I\xe2\x80\x99m busy now. Of course by-and-by--\xe2\x80\x9d There was\nno by-and-by, yet his belief that he had crushed the unclean habit made\nhim feel noble and very happy. When he called up Paul Riesling he was,\nin his moral splendor, unusually eager.\n\nHe was fonder of Paul Riesling than of any one on earth except himself\nand his daughter Tinka. They had been classmates, roommates, in the\nState University, but always he thought of Paul Riesling, with his dark\nslimness, his precisely parted hair, his nose-glasses, his hesitant\nspeech, his moodiness, his love of music, as a younger brother, to be\npetted and protected. Paul had gone into his father\xe2\x80\x99s business, after\ngraduation; he was now a wholesaler and small manufacturer of\nprepared-paper roofing. But Babbitt strenuously believed and lengthily\nannounced to the world of Good Fellows that Paul could have been a great\nviolinist or painter or writer. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy say, the letters that boy sent me\non his trip to the Canadian Rockies, they just absolutely make you see\nthe place as if you were standing there. Believe me, he could have given\nany of these bloomin\xe2\x80\x99 authors a whale of a run for their money!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nYet on the telephone they said only:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSouth 343. No, no, no! I said _South_--South 343. Say, operator, what\nthe dickens is the trouble? Can\xe2\x80\x99t you get me South 343? Why certainly\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll answer. Oh, Hello, 343? Wanta speak Mist\xe2\x80\x99 Riesling, Mist\xe2\x80\x99\nBabbitt talking.... \xe2\x80\x98Lo, Paul?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYuh.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99S George speaking.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYuh.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s old socks?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFair to middlin\xe2\x80\x99. How\xe2\x80\x99re you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine, Paulibus. Well, what do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing much.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere you been keepin\xe2\x80\x99 yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, just stickin\xe2\x80\x99 round. What\xe2\x80\x99s up, Georgie?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow \xe2\x80\x99bout lil lunch\xe2\x80\x99s noon?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe all right with me, I guess. Club?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYuh. Meet you there twelve-thirty.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x99 right. Twelve-thirty. S\xe2\x80\x99 long, Georgie.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nIV\n\nHis morning was not sharply marked into divisions. Interwoven with\ncorrespondence and advertisement-writing were a thousand nervous\ndetails: calls from clerks who were incessantly and hopefully seeking\nfive furnished rooms and bath at sixty dollars a month; advice to Mat\nPenniman on getting money out of tenants who had no money.\n\nBabbitt\xe2\x80\x99s virtues as a real-estate broker--as the servant of society in\nthe department of finding homes for families and shops for distributors\nof food--were steadiness and diligence. He was conventionally honest, he\nkept his records of buyers and sellers complete, he had experience with\nleases and titles and an excellent memory for prices. His shoulders were\nbroad enough, his voice deep enough, his relish of hearty humor strong\nenough, to establish him as one of the ruling caste of Good Fellows. Yet\nhis eventual importance to mankind was perhaps lessened by his large and\ncomplacent ignorance of all architecture save the types of houses turned\nout by speculative builders; all landscape gardening save the use of\ncurving roads, grass, and six ordinary shrubs; and all the commonest\naxioms of economics. He serenely believed that the one purpose of the\nreal-estate business was to make money for George F. Babbitt. True, it\nwas a good advertisement at Boosters\xe2\x80\x99 Club lunches, and all the\nvarieties of Annual Banquets to which Good Fellows were invited, to\nspeak sonorously of Unselfish Public Service, the Broker\xe2\x80\x99s Obligation to\nKeep Inviolate the Trust of His Clients, and a thing called Ethics,\nwhose nature was confusing but if you had it you were a High-class\nRealtor and if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t you were a shyster, a piker, and a\nfly-by-night. These virtues awakened Confidence, and enabled you to\nhandle Bigger Propositions. But they didn\xe2\x80\x99t imply that you were to be\nimpractical and refuse to take twice the value of a house if a buyer was\nsuch an idiot that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t jew you down on the asking-price.\n\nBabbitt spoke well--and often--at these orgies of commercial\nrighteousness about the \xe2\x80\x9crealtor\xe2\x80\x99s function as a seer of the future\ndevelopment of the community, and as a prophetic engineer clearing the\npathway for inevitable changes\xe2\x80\x9d--which meant that a real-estate broker\ncould make money by guessing which way the town would grow. This\nguessing he called Vision.\n\nIn an address at the Boosters\xe2\x80\x99 Club he had admitted, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is at once the\nduty and the privilege of the realtor to know everything about his own\ncity and its environs. Where a surgeon is a specialist on every vein and\nmysterious cell of the human body, and the engineer upon electricity in\nall its phases, or every bolt of some great bridge majestically arching\no\xe2\x80\x99er a mighty flood, the realtor must know his city, inch by inch, and\nall its faults and virtues.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThough he did know the market-price, inch by inch, of certain districts\nof Zenith, he did not know whether the police force was too large or too\nsmall, or whether it was in alliance with gambling and prostitution. He\nknew the means of fireproofing buildings and the relation of\ninsurance-rates to fireproofing, but he did not know how many firemen\nthere were in the city, how they were trained and paid, or how complete\ntheir apparatus. He sang eloquently the advantages of proximity of\nschool-buildings to rentable homes, but he did not know--he did not know\nthat it was worth while to know--whether the city schoolrooms were\nproperly heated, lighted, ventilated, furnished; he did not know how the\nteachers were chosen; and though he chanted \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the boasts of Zenith\nis that we pay our teachers adequately,\xe2\x80\x9d that was because he had read\nthe statement in the _Advocate-Times_. Himself, he could not have given\nthe average salary of teachers in Zenith or anywhere else.\n\nHe had heard it said that \xe2\x80\x9cconditions\xe2\x80\x9d in the County Jail and the Zenith\nCity Prison were not very \xe2\x80\x9cscientific;\xe2\x80\x9d he had, with indignation at the\ncriticism of Zenith, skimmed through a report in which the notorious\npessimist Seneca Doane, the radical lawyer, asserted that to throw boys\nand young girls into a bull-pen crammed with men suffering from\nsyphilis, delirium tremens, and insanity was not the perfect way of\neducating them. He had controverted the report by growling, \xe2\x80\x9cFolks that\nthink a jail ought to be a bloomin\xe2\x80\x99 Hotel Thornleigh make me sick. If\npeople don\xe2\x80\x99t like a jail, let \xe2\x80\x99em behave \xe2\x80\x99emselves and keep out of it.\nBesides, these reform cranks always exaggerate.\xe2\x80\x9d That was the beginning\nand quite completely the end of his investigations into Zenith\xe2\x80\x99s\ncharities and corrections; and as to the \xe2\x80\x9cvice districts\xe2\x80\x9d he brightly\nexpressed it, \xe2\x80\x9cThose are things that no decent man monkeys with.\nBesides, smatter fact, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you confidentially: it\xe2\x80\x99s a protection\nto our daughters and to decent women to have a district where tough nuts\ncan raise cain. Keeps \xe2\x80\x99em away from our own homes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs to industrial conditions, however, Babbitt had thought a great deal,\nand his opinions may be coordinated as follows:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good labor union is of value because it keeps out radical unions,\nwhich would destroy property. No one ought to be forced to belong to a\nunion, however. All labor agitators who try to force men to join a union\nshould be hanged. In fact, just between ourselves, there oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to be\nany unions allowed at all; and as it\xe2\x80\x99s the best way of fighting the\nunions, every business man ought to belong to an employers\xe2\x80\x99-association\nand to the Chamber of Commerce. In union there is strength. So any\nselfish hog who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t join the Chamber of Commerce ought to be forced\nto.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn nothing--as the expert on whose advice families moved to new\nneighborhoods to live there for a generation--was Babbitt more\nsplendidly innocent than in the science of sanitation. He did not know a\nmalaria-bearing mosquito from a bat; he knew nothing about tests of\ndrinking water; and in the matters of plumbing and sewage he was as\nunlearned as he was voluble. He often referred to the excellence of the\nbathrooms in the houses he sold. He was fond of explaining why it was\nthat no European ever bathed. Some one had told him, when he was\ntwenty-two, that all cesspools were unhealthy, and he still denounced\nthem. If a client impertinently wanted him to sell a house which had a\ncesspool, Babbitt always spoke about it--before accepting the house and\nselling it.\n\nWhen he laid out the Glen Oriole acreage development, when he ironed\nwoodland and dipping meadow into a glenless, orioleless, sunburnt flat\nprickly with small boards displaying the names of imaginary streets, he\nrighteously put in a complete sewage-system. It made him feel superior;\nit enabled him to sneer privily at the Martin Lumsen development,\nAvonlea, which had a cesspool; and it provided a chorus for the\nfull-page advertisements in which he announced the beauty, convenience,\ncheapness, and supererogatory healthfulness of Glen Oriole. The only\nflaw was that the Glen Oriole sewers had insufficient outlet, so that\nwaste remained in them, not very agreeably, while the Avonlea cesspool\nwas a Waring septic tank.\n\nThe whole of the Glen Oriole project was a suggestion that Babbitt,\nthough he really did hate men recognized as swindlers, was not too\nunreasonably honest. Operators and buyers prefer that brokers should not\nbe in competition with them as operators and buyers themselves, but\nattend to their clients\xe2\x80\x99 interests only. It was supposed that the\nBabbitt-Thompson Company were merely agents for Glen Oriole, serving the\nreal owner, Jake Offutt, but the fact was that Babbitt and Thompson\nowned sixty-two per cent. of the Glen, the president and purchasing\nagent of the Zenith Street Traction Company owned twenty-eight per\ncent., and Jake Offutt (a gang-politician, a small manufacturer, a\ntobacco-chewing old farceur who enjoyed dirty politics, business\ndiplomacy, and cheating at poker) had only ten per cent., which Babbitt\nand the Traction officials had given to him for \xe2\x80\x9cfixing\xe2\x80\x9d health\ninspectors and fire inspectors and a member of the State Transportation\nCommission.\n\nBut Babbitt was virtuous. He advocated, though he did not practise, the\nprohibition of alcohol; he praised, though he did not obey, the laws\nagainst motor-speeding; he paid his debts; he contributed to the church,\nthe Red Cross, and the Y. M. C. A.; he followed the custom of his clan\nand cheated only as it was sanctified by precedent; and he never\ndescended to trickery--though, as he explained to Paul Riesling:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourse I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say that every ad I write is literally true or\nthat I always believe everything I say when I give some buyer a good\nstrong selling-spiel. You see--you see it\xe2\x80\x99s like this: In the first\nplace, maybe the owner of the property exaggerated when he put it into\nmy hands, and it certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t my place to go proving my principal a\nliar! And then most folks are so darn crooked themselves that they\nexpect a fellow to do a little lying, so if I was fool enough to never\nwhoop the ante I\xe2\x80\x99d get the credit for lying anyway! In self-defense I\ngot to toot my own horn, like a lawyer defending a client--his bounden\nduty, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it, to bring out the poor dub\xe2\x80\x99s good points? Why, the Judge\nhimself would bawl out a lawyer that didn\xe2\x80\x99t, even if they both knew the\nguy was guilty! But even so, I don\xe2\x80\x99t pad out the truth like Cecil\nRountree or Thayer or the rest of these realtors. Fact, I think a fellow\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s willing to deliberately up and profit by lying ought to be shot!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt\xe2\x80\x99s value to his clients was rarely better shown than this\nmorning, in the conference at eleven-thirty between himself, Conrad\nLyte, and Archibald Purdy.\n\n\nV\n\nConrad Lyte was a real-estate speculator. He was a nervous speculator.\nBefore he gambled he consulted bankers, lawyers, architects, contracting\nbuilders, and all of their clerks and stenographers who were willing to\nbe cornered and give him advice. He was a bold entrepreneur, and he\ndesired nothing more than complete safety in his investments, freedom\nfrom attention to details, and the thirty or forty per cent. profit\nwhich, according to all authorities, a pioneer deserves for his risks\nand foresight. He was a stubby man with a cap-like mass of short gray\ncurls and clothes which, no matter how well cut, seemed shaggy. Below\nhis eyes were semicircular hollows, as though silver dollars had been\npressed against them and had left an imprint.\n\nParticularly and always Lyte consulted Babbitt, and trusted in his slow\ncautiousness.\n\nSix months ago Babbitt had learned that one Archibald Purdy, a grocer in\nthe indecisive residential district known as Linton, was talking of\nopening a butcher shop beside his grocery. Looking up the ownership of\nadjoining parcels of land, Babbitt found that Purdy owned his present\nshop but did not own the one available lot adjoining. He advised Conrad\nLyte to purchase this lot, for eleven thousand dollars, though an\nappraisal on a basis of rents did not indicate its value as above nine\nthousand. The rents, declared Babbitt, were too low; and by waiting they\ncould make Purdy come to their price. (This was Vision.) He had to bully\nLyte into buying. His first act as agent for Lyte was to increase the\nrent of the battered store-building on the lot. The tenant said a number\nof rude things, but he paid.\n\nNow, Purdy seemed ready to buy, and his delay was going to cost him ten\nthousand extra dollars--the reward paid by the community to Mr. Conrad\nLyte for the virtue of employing a broker who had Vision and who\nunderstood Talking Points, Strategic Values, Key Situations,\nUnderappraisals, and the Psychology of Salesmanship.\n\nLyte came to the conference exultantly. He was fond of Babbitt, this\nmorning, and called him \xe2\x80\x9cold hoss.\xe2\x80\x9d Purdy, the grocer, a long-nosed man\nand solemn, seemed to care less for Babbitt and for Vision, but Babbitt\nmet him at the street door of the office and guided him toward the\nprivate room with affectionate little cries of \xe2\x80\x9cThis way, Brother\nPurdy!\xe2\x80\x9d He took from the correspondence-file the entire box of cigars\nand forced them on his guests. He pushed their chairs two inches forward\nand three inches back, which gave an hospitable note, then leaned back\nin his desk-chair and looked plump and jolly. But he spoke to the\nweakling grocer with firmness.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Brother Purdy, we been having some pretty tempting offers from\nbutchers and a slew of other folks for that lot next to your store, but\nI persuaded Brother Lyte that we ought to give you a shot at the\nproperty first. I said to Lyte, \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99d be a rotten shame,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98if\nsomebody went and opened a combination grocery and meat market right\nnext door and ruined Purdy\xe2\x80\x99s nice little business.\xe2\x80\x99 Especially--\xe2\x80\x9d\nBabbitt leaned forward, and his voice was harsh, \xe2\x80\x9c--it would be hard\nluck if one of these cash-and-carry chain-stores got in there and\nstarted cutting prices below cost till they got rid of competition and\nforced you to the wall!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPurdy snatched his thin hands from his pockets, pulled up his trousers,\nthrust his hands back into his pockets, tilted in the heavy oak chair,\nand tried to look amused, as he struggled:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they\xe2\x80\x99re bad competition. But I guess you don\xe2\x80\x99t realize the Pulling\nPower that Personality has in a neighborhood business.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe great Babbitt smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so. Just as you feel, old man. We\nthought we\xe2\x80\x99d give you first chance. All right then--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow look here!\xe2\x80\x9d Purdy wailed. \xe2\x80\x9cI know f\xe2\x80\x99r a fact that a piece of\nproperty \xe2\x80\x99bout same size, right near, sold for less \xe2\x80\x99n eighty-five\nhundred, \xe2\x80\x99twa\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t two years ago, and here you fellows are asking me\ntwenty-four thousand dollars! Why, I\xe2\x80\x99d have to mortgage-- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind\nso much paying twelve thousand but-- Why good God, Mr. Babbitt, you\xe2\x80\x99re\nasking more \xe2\x80\x99n twice its value! And threatening to ruin me if I don\xe2\x80\x99t\ntake it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPurdy, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like your way of talking! I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it one little\nbit! Supposing Lyte and I were stinking enough to want to ruin any\nfellow human, don\xe2\x80\x99t you suppose we know it\xe2\x80\x99s to our own selfish interest\nto have everybody in Zenith prosperous? But all this is beside the\npoint. Tell you what we\xe2\x80\x99ll do: We\xe2\x80\x99ll come down to twenty-three\nthousand--five thousand down and the rest on mortgage--and if you want\nto wreck the old shack and rebuild, I guess I can get Lyte here to\nloosen up for a building-mortgage on good liberal terms. Heavens, man,\nwe\xe2\x80\x99d be glad to oblige you! We don\xe2\x80\x99t like these foreign grocery trusts\nany better \xe2\x80\x99n you do! But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t reasonable to expect us to sacrifice\neleven thousand or more just for neighborliness, _is_ it! How about it,\nLyte? You willing to come down?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBy warmly taking Purdy\xe2\x80\x99s part, Babbitt persuaded the benevolent Mr. Lyte\nto reduce his price to twenty-one thousand dollars. At the right moment\nBabbitt snatched from a drawer the agreement he had had Miss McGoun type\nout a week ago and thrust it into Purdy\xe2\x80\x99s hands. He genially shook his\nfountain pen to make certain that it was flowing, handed it to Purdy,\nand approvingly watched him sign.\n\nThe work of the world was being done. Lyte had made something over nine\nthousand dollars, Babbitt had made a four-hundred-and-fifty dollar\ncommission, Purdy had, by the sensitive mechanism of modern finance,\nbeen provided with a business-building, and soon the happy inhabitants\nof Linton would have meat lavished upon them at prices only a little\nhigher than those down-town.\n\nIt had been a manly battle, but after it Babbitt drooped. This was the\nonly really amusing contest he had been planning. There was nothing\nahead save details of leases, appraisals, mortgages.\n\nHe muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cMakes me sick to think of Lyte carrying off most of the\nprofit when I did all the work, the old skinflint! And-- What else have I\ngot to do to-day?... Like to take a good long vacation. Motor trip.\nSomething.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe sprang up, rekindled by the thought of lunching with Paul Riesling.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nI\n\nBabbitt\xe2\x80\x99s preparations for leaving the office to its feeble self during\nthe hour and a half of his lunch-period were somewhat less elaborate\nthan the plans for a general European war.\n\nHe fretted to Miss McGoun, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat time you going to lunch? Well, make\nsure Miss Bannigan is in then. Explain to her that if Wiedenfeldt calls\nup, she\xe2\x80\x99s to tell him I\xe2\x80\x99m already having the title traced. And oh, b\xe2\x80\x99\nthe way, remind me to-morrow to have Penniman trace it. Now if anybody\ncomes in looking for a cheap house, remember we got to shove that Bangor\nRoad place off onto somebody. If you need me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be at the Athletic\nClub. And--uh-- And--uh-- I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back by two.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe dusted the cigar-ashes off his vest. He placed a difficult unanswered\nletter on the pile of unfinished work, that he might not fail to attend\nto it that afternoon. (For three noons, now, he had placed the same\nletter on the unfinished pile.) He scrawled on a sheet of yellow\nbacking-paper the memorandum: \xe2\x80\x9cSee abt apt h drs,\xe2\x80\x9d which gave him an\nagreeable feeling of having already seen about the apartment-house\ndoors.\n\nHe discovered that he was smoking another cigar. He threw it away,\nprotesting, \xe2\x80\x9cDarn it, I thought you\xe2\x80\x99d quit this darn smoking!\xe2\x80\x9d He\ncourageously returned the cigar-box to the correspondence-file, locked\nit up, hid the key in a more difficult place, and raged, \xe2\x80\x9cOught to take\ncare of myself. And need more exercise--walk to the club, every single\nnoon--just what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do--every noon--cut out this motoring all the\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe resolution made him feel exemplary. Immediately after it he decided\nthat this noon it was too late to walk.\n\nIt took but little more time to start his car and edge it into the\ntraffic than it would have taken to walk the three and a half blocks to\nthe club.\n\n\nII\n\nAs he drove he glanced with the fondness of familiarity at the\nbuildings.\n\nA stranger suddenly dropped into the business-center of Zenith could not\nhave told whether he was in a city of Oregon or Georgia, Ohio or Maine,\nOklahoma or Manitoba. But to Babbitt every inch was individual and\nstirring. As always he noted that the California Building across the way\nwas three stories lower, therefore three stories less beautiful, than\nhis own Reeves Building. As always when he passed the Parthenon Shoe\nShine Parlor, a one-story hut which beside the granite and red-brick\nponderousness of the old California Building resembled a bath-house\nunder a cliff, he commented, \xe2\x80\x9cGosh, ought to get my shoes shined this\nafternoon. Keep forgetting it.\xe2\x80\x9d At the Simplex Office Furniture Shop,\nthe National Cash Register Agency, he yearned for a dictaphone, for a\ntypewriter which would add and multiply, as a poet yearns for quartos or\na physician for radium.\n\nAt the Nobby Men\xe2\x80\x99s Wear Shop he took his left hand off the\nsteering-wheel to touch his scarf, and thought well of himself as one\nwho bought expensive ties \xe2\x80\x9cand could pay cash for \xe2\x80\x99em, too, by golly;\xe2\x80\x9d\nand at the United Cigar Store, with its crimson and gold alertness, he\nreflected, \xe2\x80\x9cWonder if I need some cigars--idiot--plumb forgot--going t\xe2\x80\x99\ncut down my fool smoking.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at his bank, the Miners\xe2\x80\x99 and\nDrovers\xe2\x80\x99 National, and considered how clever and solid he was to bank\nwith so marbled an establishment. His high moment came in the clash of\ntraffic when he was halted at the corner beneath the lofty Second\nNational Tower. His car was banked with four others in a line of steel\nrestless as cavalry, while the crosstown traffic, limousines and\nenormous moving-vans and insistent motor-cycles, poured by; on the\nfarther corner, pneumatic riveters rang on the sun-plated skeleton of a\nnew building; and out of this tornado flashed the inspiration of a\nfamiliar face, and a fellow Booster shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99 are you, George!\xe2\x80\x9d\nBabbitt waved in neighborly affection, and slid on with the traffic as\nthe policeman lifted his hand. He noted how quickly his car picked up.\nHe felt superior and powerful, like a shuttle of polished steel darting\nin a vast machine.\n\nAs always he ignored the next two blocks, decayed blocks not yet\nreclaimed from the grime and shabbiness of the Zenith of 1885. While he\nwas passing the five-and-ten-cent store, the Dakota Lodging House,\nConcordia Hall with its lodge-rooms and the offices of fortune-tellers\nand chiropractors, he thought of how much money he made, and he boasted\na little and worried a little and did old familiar sums:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour hundred fifty plunks this morning from the Lyte deal. But taxes\ndue. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see: I ought to pull out eight thousand net this year, and\nsave fifteen hundred of that--no, not if I put up garage and-- Let\xe2\x80\x99s see:\nsix hundred and forty clear last month, and twelve times six-forty\nmakes--makes--let see: six times twelve is seventy-two hundred and-- Oh\nrats, anyway, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make eight thousand--gee now, that\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad;\nmighty few fellows pulling down eight thousand dollars a year--eight\nthousand good hard iron dollars--bet there isn\xe2\x80\x99t more than five per\ncent. of the people in the whole United States that make more than Uncle\nGeorge does, by golly! Right up at the top of the heap! But-- Way\nexpenses are-- Family wasting gasoline, and always dressed like\nmillionaires, and sending that eighty a month to Mother-- And all these\nstenographers and salesmen gouging me for every cent they can get--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe effect of his scientific budget-planning was that he felt at once\ntriumphantly wealthy and perilously poor, and in the midst of\nthese dissertations he stopped his car, rushed into a small\nnews-and-miscellany shop, and bought the electric cigar-lighter which he\nhad coveted for a week. He dodged his conscience by being jerky and\nnoisy, and by shouting at the clerk, \xe2\x80\x9cGuess this will prett\xe2\x80\x99 near pay\nfor itself in matches, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was a pretty thing, a nickeled cylinder with an almost silvery\nsocket, to be attached to the dashboard of his car. It was not only, as\nthe placard on the counter observed, \xe2\x80\x9ca dandy little refinement, lending\nthe last touch of class to a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s auto,\xe2\x80\x9d but a priceless\ntime-saver. By freeing him from halting the car to light a match, it\nwould in a month or two easily save ten minutes.\n\nAs he drove on he glanced at it. \xe2\x80\x9cPretty nice. Always wanted one,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid wistfully. \xe2\x80\x9cThe one thing a smoker needs, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen he remembered that he had given up smoking.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDarn it!\xe2\x80\x9d he mourned. \xe2\x80\x9cOh well, I suppose I\xe2\x80\x99ll hit a cigar once in a\nwhile. And-- Be a great convenience for other folks. Might make just the\ndifference in getting chummy with some fellow that would put over a\nsale. And-- Certainly looks nice there. Certainly is a mighty clever\nlittle jigger. Gives the last touch of refinement and class. I-- By\ngolly, I guess I can afford it if I want to! Not going to be the only\nmember of this family that never has a single doggone luxury!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThus, laden with treasure, after three and a half blocks of romantic\nadventure, he drove up to the club.\n\n\nIII\n\nThe Zenith Athletic Club is not athletic and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly a club,\nbut it is Zenith in perfection. It has an active and smoke-misted\nbilliard room, it is represented by baseball and football teams, and in\nthe pool and the gymnasium a tenth of the members sporadically try to\nreduce. But most of its three thousand members use it as a caf\xc3\xa9 in which\nto lunch, play cards, tell stories, meet customers, and entertain\nout-of-town uncles at dinner. It is the largest club in the city, and\nits chief hatred is the conservative Union Club, which all sound members\nof the Athletic call \xe2\x80\x9ca rotten, snobbish, dull, expensive old hole--not\none Good Mixer in the place--you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hire me to join.\xe2\x80\x9d Statistics\nshow that no member of the Athletic has ever refused election to the\nUnion, and of those who are elected, sixty-seven per cent. resign from\nthe Athletic and are thereafter heard to say, in the drowsy sanctity of\nthe Union lounge, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Athletic would be a pretty good hotel, if it were\nmore exclusive.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Athletic Club building is nine stories high, yellow brick with\nglassy roof-garden above and portico of huge limestone columns below.\nThe lobby, with its thick pillars of porous Caen stone, its pointed\nvaulting, and a brown glazed-tile floor like well-baked bread-crust, is\na combination of cathedral-crypt and rathskellar. The members rush into\nthe lobby as though they were shopping and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t much time for it. Thus\ndid Babbitt enter, and to the group standing by the cigar-counter he\nwhooped, \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s the boys? How\xe2\x80\x99s the boys? Well, well, fine day!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJovially they whooped back--Vergil Gunch, the coal-dealer, Sidney\nFinkelstein, the ladies\xe2\x80\x99-ready-to-wear buyer for Parcher & Stein\xe2\x80\x99s\ndepartment-store, and Professor Joseph K. Pumphrey, owner of the Riteway\nBusiness College and instructor in Public Speaking, Business English,\nScenario Writing, and Commercial Law. Though Babbitt admired this\nsavant, and appreciated Sidney Finkelstein as \xe2\x80\x9ca mighty smart buyer and\na good liberal spender,\xe2\x80\x9d it was to Vergil Gunch that he turned with\nenthusiasm. Mr. Gunch was president of the Boosters\xe2\x80\x99 Club, a weekly\nlunch-club, local chapter of a national organization which promoted\nsound business and friendliness among Regular Fellows. He was also no\nless an official than Esteemed Leading Knight in the Benevolent and\nProtective Order of Elks, and it was rumored that at the next election\nhe would be a candidate for Exalted Ruler. He was a jolly man, given to\noratory and to chumminess with the arts. He called on the famous actors\nand vaudeville artists when they came to town, gave them cigars,\naddressed them by their first names, and--sometimes--succeeded in\nbringing them to the Boosters\xe2\x80\x99 lunches to give The Boys a Free\nEntertainment. He was a large man with hair _en brosse_, and he knew the\nlatest jokes, but he played poker close to the chest. It was at his\nparty that Babbitt had sucked in the virus of to-day\xe2\x80\x99s restlessness.\n\nGunch shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s the old Bolsheviki? How do you feel, the morning\nafter the night before?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, boy! Some head! That was a regular party you threw, Verg! Hope you\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t forgotten I took that last cute little jack-pot!\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt\nbellowed. (He was three feet from Gunch.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right now! What I\xe2\x80\x99ll hand you next time, Georgie! Say, juh\nnotice in the paper the way the New York Assembly stood up to the Reds?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet I did. That was fine, eh? Nice day to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s one mighty fine spring day, but nights still cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeh, you\xe2\x80\x99re right they are! Had to have coupla blankets last night, out\non the sleeping-porch. Say, Sid,\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt turned to Finkelstein, the\nbuyer, \xe2\x80\x9cgot something wanta ask you about. I went out and bought me an\nelectric cigar-lighter for the car, this noon, and--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood hunch!\xe2\x80\x9d said Finkelstein, while even the learned Professor\nPumphrey, a bulbous man with a pepper-and-salt cutaway and a pipe-organ\nvoice, commented, \xe2\x80\x9cThat makes a dandy accessory. Cigar-lighter gives\ntone to the dashboard.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYep, finally decided I\xe2\x80\x99d buy me one. Got the best on the market, the\nclerk said it was. Paid five bucks for it. Just wondering if I got\nstuck. What do they charge for \xe2\x80\x99em at the store, Sid?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFinkelstein asserted that five dollars was not too great a sum, not for\na really high-class lighter which was suitably nickeled and provided\nwith connections of the very best quality. \xe2\x80\x9cI always say--and believe\nme, I base it on a pretty fairly extensive mercantile experience--the\nbest is the cheapest in the long run. Of course if a fellow wants to be\na Jew about it, he can get cheap junk, but in the long _run_, the\ncheapest thing is--the best you can get! Now you take here just th\xe2\x80\x99\nother day: I got a new top for my old boat and some upholstery, and I\npaid out a hundred and twenty-six fifty, and of course a lot of fellows\nwould say that was too much-- Lord, if the Old Folks--they live in one of\nthese hick towns up-state and they simply can\xe2\x80\x99t get onto the way a city\nfellow\xe2\x80\x99s mind works, and then, of course, they\xe2\x80\x99re Jews, and they\xe2\x80\x99d lie\nright down and die if they knew Sid had anted up a hundred and\ntwenty-six bones. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t figure I was stuck, George, not a bit.\nMachine looks brand new now--not that it\xe2\x80\x99s so darned old, of course; had\nit less \xe2\x80\x99n three years, but I give it hard service; never drive less \xe2\x80\x99n\na hundred miles on Sunday and, uh-- Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really think you got\nstuck, George. In the _long_ run, the best is, you might say, it\xe2\x80\x99s\nunquestionably the cheapest.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vergil Gunch. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way I look at it. If a\nfellow is keyed up to what you might call intensive living, the way you\nget it here in Zenith--all the hustle and mental activity that\xe2\x80\x99s going\non with a bunch of live-wires like the Boosters and here in the Z.A.C.,\nwhy, he\xe2\x80\x99s got to save his nerves by having the best.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt nodded his head at every fifth word in the roaring rhythm; and\nby the conclusion, in Gunch\xe2\x80\x99s renowned humorous vein, he was enchanted:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, at that, George, don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x99s you can afford it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard your\nbusiness has been kind of under the eye of the gov\xe2\x80\x99ment since you stole\nthe tail of Eathorne Park and sold it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99re a great little josher, Verg. But when it comes to kidding,\nhow about this report that you stole the black marble steps off the\npost-office and sold \xe2\x80\x99em for high-grade coal!\xe2\x80\x9d In delight Babbitt\npatted Gunch\xe2\x80\x99s back, stroked his arm.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right, but what I want to know is: who\xe2\x80\x99s the real-estate\nshark that bought that coal for his apartment-houses?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess that\xe2\x80\x99ll hold you for a while, George!\xe2\x80\x9d said Finkelstein. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\ntell you, though, boys, what I did hear: George\xe2\x80\x99s missus went into the\ngents\xe2\x80\x99 wear department at Parcher\xe2\x80\x99s to buy him some collars, and before\nshe could give his neck-size the clerk slips her some thirteens. \xe2\x80\x98How\njuh know the size?\xe2\x80\x99 says Mrs. Babbitt, and the clerk says, \xe2\x80\x98Men that let\ntheir wives buy collars for \xe2\x80\x99em always wear thirteen, madam.\xe2\x80\x99 How\xe2\x80\x99s\nthat! That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good, eh? How\xe2\x80\x99s that, eh? I guess that\xe2\x80\x99ll about fix\nyou, George!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--I--\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt sought for amiable insults in answer. He stopped,\nstared at the door. Paul Riesling was coming in. Babbitt cried, \xe2\x80\x9cSee you\nlater, boys,\xe2\x80\x9d and hastened across the lobby. He was, just then, neither\nthe sulky child of the sleeping-porch, the domestic tyrant of the\nbreakfast table, the crafty money-changer of the Lyte-Purdy conference,\nnor the blaring Good Fellow, the Josher and Regular Guy, of the Athletic\nClub. He was an older brother to Paul Riesling, swift to defend him,\nadmiring him with a proud and credulous love passing the love of women.\nPaul and he shook hands solemnly; they smiled as shyly as though they\nhad been parted three years, not three days--and they said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s the old horse-thief?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, I guess. How\xe2\x80\x99re you, you poor shrimp?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m first-rate, you second-hand hunk o\xe2\x80\x99 cheese.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nReassured thus of their high fondness, Babbitt grunted, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a fine\nguy, you are! Ten minutes late!\xe2\x80\x9d Riesling snapped, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99re lucky\nto have a chance to lunch with a gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d They grinned and went into\nthe Neronian washroom, where a line of men bent over the bowls inset\nalong a prodigious slab of marble as in religious prostration before\ntheir own images in the massy mirror. Voices thick, satisfied,\nauthoritative, hurtled along the marble walls, bounded from the ceiling\nof lavender-bordered milky tiles, while the lords of the city, the\nbarons of insurance and law and fertilizers and motor tires, laid down\nthe law for Zenith; announced that the day was warm--indeed,\nindisputably of spring; that wages were too high and the interest on\nmortgages too low; that Babe Ruth, the eminent player of baseball, was a\nnoble man; and that \xe2\x80\x9cthose two nuts at the Climax Vaudeville Theater\nthis week certainly are a slick pair of actors.\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt, though\nordinarily his voice was the surest and most episcopal of all, was\nsilent. In the presence of the slight dark reticence of Paul Riesling,\nhe was awkward, he desired to be quiet and firm and deft.\n\nThe entrance lobby of the Athletic Club was Gothic, the washroom Roman\nImperial, the lounge Spanish Mission, and the reading-room in Chinese\nChippendale, but the gem of the club was the dining-room, the\nmasterpiece of Ferdinand Reitman, Zenith\xe2\x80\x99s busiest architect. It was\nlofty and half-timbered, with Tudor leaded casements, an oriel, a\nsomewhat musicianless musicians\xe2\x80\x99-gallery, and tapestries believed to\nillustrate the granting of Magna Charta. The open beams had been\nhand-adzed at Jake Offutt\xe2\x80\x99s car-body works, the hinges were of\nhand-wrought iron, the wainscot studded with handmade wooden pegs, and\nat one end of the room was a heraldic and hooded stone fireplace which\nthe club\xe2\x80\x99s advertising-pamphlet asserted to be not only larger than any\nof the fireplaces in European castles but of a draught incomparably more\nscientific. It was also much cleaner, as no fire had ever been built in\nit.\n\nHalf of the tables were mammoth slabs which seated twenty or thirty men.\nBabbitt usually sat at the one near the door, with a group including\nGunch, Finkelstein, Professor Pumphrey, Howard Littlefield, his\nneighbor, T. Cholmondeley Frink, the poet and advertising-agent, and\nOrville Jones, whose laundry was in many ways the best in Zenith. They\ncomposed a club within the club, and merrily called themselves \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nRoughnecks.\xe2\x80\x9d To-day as he passed their table the Roughnecks greeted him,\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, sit in! You \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 Paul too proud to feed with poor folks? Afraid\nsomebody might stick you for a bottle of Bevo, George? Strikes me you\nswells are getting awful darn exclusive!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe thundered, \xe2\x80\x9cYou bet! We can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to have our reps ruined by being\nseen with you tightwads!\xe2\x80\x9d and guided Paul to one of the small tables\nbeneath the musicians\xe2\x80\x99-gallery. He felt guilty. At the Zenith Athletic\nClub, privacy was very bad form. But he wanted Paul to himself.\n\nThat morning he had advocated lighter lunches and now he ordered nothing\nbut English mutton chop, radishes, peas, deep-dish apple pie, a bit of\ncheese, and a pot of coffee with cream, adding, as he did invariably,\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd uh-- Oh, and you might give me an order of French fried potatoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhen the chop came he vigorously peppered it and salted it. He always\npeppered and salted his meat, and vigorously, before tasting it.\n\nPaul and he took up the spring-like quality of the spring, the virtues\nof the electric cigar-lighter, and the action of the New York State\nAssembly. It was not till Babbitt was thick and disconsolate with mutton\ngrease that he flung out:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wound up a nice little deal with Conrad Lyte this morning that put\nfive hundred good round plunks in my pocket. Pretty nice--pretty nice!\nAnd yet-- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with me to-day. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s an\nattack of spring fever, or staying up too late at Verg Gunch\xe2\x80\x99s, or maybe\nit\xe2\x80\x99s just the winter\xe2\x80\x99s work piling up, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve felt kind of down in the\nmouth all day long. Course I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t beef about it to the fellows at\nthe Roughnecks\xe2\x80\x99 Table there, but you-- Ever feel that way, Paul? Kind of\ncomes over me: here I\xe2\x80\x99ve pretty much done all the things I ought to;\nsupported my family, and got a good house and a six-cylinder car, and\nbuilt up a nice little business, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any vices \xe2\x80\x99specially,\nexcept smoking--and I\xe2\x80\x99m practically cutting that out, by the way. And I\nbelong to the church, and play enough golf to keep in trim, and I only\nassociate with good decent fellows. And yet, even so, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that\nI\xe2\x80\x99m entirely satisfied!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was drawled out, broken by shouts from the neighboring tables, by\nmechanical love-making to the waitress, by stertorous grunts as the\ncoffee filled him with dizziness and indigestion. He was apologetic and\ndoubtful, and it was Paul, with his thin voice, who pierced the fog:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord, George, you don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s any novelty to me to find\nthat we hustlers, that think we\xe2\x80\x99re so all-fired successful, aren\xe2\x80\x99t\ngetting much out of it? You look as if you expected me to report you as\nseditious! You know what my own life\xe2\x80\x99s been.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, old man.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have been a fiddler, and I\xe2\x80\x99m a pedler of tar-roofing! And\nZilla-- Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to squeal, but you know as well as I do about\nhow inspiring a wife she is.... Typical instance last evening: We went\nto the movies. There was a big crowd waiting in the lobby, us at the\ntail-end. She began to push right through it with her \xe2\x80\x98Sir, how dare\nyou?\xe2\x80\x99 manner-- Honestly, sometimes when I look at her and see how she\xe2\x80\x99s\nalways so made up and stinking of perfume and looking for trouble and\nkind of always yelping, \xe2\x80\x98I tell yuh I\xe2\x80\x99m a lady, damn yuh!\xe2\x80\x99--why, I want\nto kill her! Well, she keeps elbowing through the crowd, me after her,\nfeeling good and ashamed, till she\xe2\x80\x99s almost up to the velvet rope and\nready to be the next let in. But there was a little squirt of a man\nthere--probably been waiting half an hour-- I kind of admired the little\ncuss--and he turns on Zilla and says, perfectly polite, \xe2\x80\x98Madam, why are\nyou trying to push past me?\xe2\x80\x99 And she simply-- God, I was so ashamed!--she\nrips out at him, \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re no gentleman,\xe2\x80\x99 and she drags me into it and\nhollers, \xe2\x80\x98Paul, this person insulted me!\xe2\x80\x99 and the poor skate, he got\nready to fight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made out I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard them--sure! same as you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear a\nboiler-factory!--and I tried to look away-- I can tell you exactly how\nevery tile looks in the ceiling of that lobby; there\xe2\x80\x99s one with brown\nspots on it like the face of the devil--and all the time the people\nthere--they were packed in like sardines--they kept making remarks about\nus, and Zilla went right on talking about the little chap, and\nscreeching that \xe2\x80\x98folks like him oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to be admitted in a place\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s _supposed_ to be for ladies and gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Paul, will you\nkindly call the manager, so I can report this dirty rat?\xe2\x80\x99 and-- Oof!\nMaybe I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t glad when I could sneak inside and hide in the dark!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter twenty-four years of that kind of thing, you don\xe2\x80\x99t expect me to\nfall down and foam at the mouth when you hint that this sweet, clean,\nrespectable, moral life isn\xe2\x80\x99t all it\xe2\x80\x99s cracked up to be, do you? I can\xe2\x80\x99t\neven talk about it, except to you, because anybody else would think I\nwas yellow. Maybe I am. Don\xe2\x80\x99t care any longer.... Gosh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve had to\nstand a lot of whining from me, first and last, Georgie!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRats, now, Paul, you\xe2\x80\x99ve never really what you could call whined.\nSometimes-- I\xe2\x80\x99m always blowing to Myra and the kids about what a whale of\na realtor I am, and yet sometimes I get a sneaking idea I\xe2\x80\x99m not such a\nPierpont Morgan as I let on to be. But if I ever do help by jollying you\nalong, old Paulski, I guess maybe Saint Pete may let me in after all!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYuh, you\xe2\x80\x99re an old blow-hard, Georgie, you cheerful cutthroat, but\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly kept me going.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you divorce Zilla?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t I! If I only could! If she\xe2\x80\x99d just give me the chance! You\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hire her to divorce me, no, nor desert me. She\xe2\x80\x99s too fond of\nher three squares and a few pounds of nut-center chocolates in between.\nIf she\xe2\x80\x99d only be what they call unfaithful to me! George, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\nto be too much of a stinker; back in college I\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99ve thought a man who\ncould say that ought to be shot at sunrise. But honestly, I\xe2\x80\x99d be\ntickled to death if she\xe2\x80\x99d really go making love with somebody. Fat\nchance! Of course she\xe2\x80\x99ll flirt with anything--you know how she holds\nhands and laughs--that laugh--that horrible brassy laugh--the way she\nyaps, \xe2\x80\x98You naughty man, you better be careful or my big husband will be\nafter you!\xe2\x80\x99--and the guy looking me over and thinking, \xe2\x80\x98Why, you cute\nlittle thing, you run away now or I\xe2\x80\x99ll spank you!\xe2\x80\x99 And she\xe2\x80\x99ll let him go\njust far enough so she gets some excitement out of it and then she\xe2\x80\x99ll\nbegin to do the injured innocent and have a beautiful time wailing, \xe2\x80\x98I\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t think you were that kind of a person.\xe2\x80\x99 They talk about these\n_demi-vierges_ in stories--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese _whats_?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c--but the wise, hard, corseted, old married women like Zilla are worse\nthan any bobbed-haired girl that ever went boldly out into this-here\nstorm of life--and kept her umbrella slid up her sleeve! But rats, you\nknow what Zilla is. How she nags--nags--nags. How she wants everything I\ncan buy her, and a lot that I can\xe2\x80\x99t, and how absolutely unreasonable she\nis, and when I get sore and try to have it out with her she plays the\nPerfect Lady so well that even I get fooled and get all tangled up in a\nlot of \xe2\x80\x98Why did you say\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you,\nGeorgie: You know my tastes are pretty fairly simple--in the matter of\nfood, at least. Course, as you\xe2\x80\x99re always complaining, I do like decent\ncigars--not those Flor de Cabagos you\xe2\x80\x99re smoking--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right now! That\xe2\x80\x99s a good two-for. By the way, Paul, did I\ntell you I decided to practically cut out smok--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes you-- At the same time, if I can\xe2\x80\x99t get what I like, why, I can do\nwithout it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind sitting down to burnt steak, with canned\npeaches and store cake for a thrilling little dessert afterwards, but I\ndo draw the line at having to sympathize with Zilla because she\xe2\x80\x99s so\nrotten bad-tempered that the cook has quit, and she\xe2\x80\x99s been so busy\nsitting in a dirty lace neglig\xc3\xa9e all afternoon, reading about some brave\nmanly Western hero, that she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had time to do any cooking. You\xe2\x80\x99re\nalways talking about \xe2\x80\x98morals\xe2\x80\x99--meaning monogamy, I suppose. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been\nthe rock of ages to me, all right, but you\xe2\x80\x99re essentially a simp. You--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere d\xe2\x80\x99 you get that \xe2\x80\x98simp,\xe2\x80\x99 little man? Let me tell you--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c--love to look earnest and inform the world that it\xe2\x80\x99s the \xe2\x80\x98duty of\nresponsible business men to be strictly moral, as an example to the\ncommunity.\xe2\x80\x99 In fact you\xe2\x80\x99re so earnest about morality, old Georgie, that\nI hate to think how essentially immoral you must be underneath. All\nright, you can--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, wait now! What\xe2\x80\x99s--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c--talk about morals all you want to, old thing, but believe me, if it\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for you and an occasional evening playing the violin to\nTerrill O\xe2\x80\x99Farrell\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99cello, and three or four darling girls that let me\nforget this beastly joke they call \xe2\x80\x98respectable life,\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99ve killed\nmyself years ago.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd business! The roofing business! Roofs for cowsheds! Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nmean I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a lot of fun out of the Game; out of putting it over\non the labor unions, and seeing a big check coming in, and the business\nincreasing. But what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of it? You know, my business isn\xe2\x80\x99t\ndistributing roofing--it\xe2\x80\x99s principally keeping my competitors from\ndistributing roofing. Same with you. All we do is cut each other\xe2\x80\x99s\nthroats and make the public pay for it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here now, Paul! You\xe2\x80\x99re pretty darn near talking socialism!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, of course I don\xe2\x80\x99t really exactly mean that-- I s\xe2\x80\x99pose.\nCourse--competition--brings out the best--survival of the\nfittest--but-- But I mean: Take all these fellows we know, the kind right\nhere in the club now, that seem to be perfectly content with their\nhome-life and their businesses, and that boost Zenith and the Chamber of\nCommerce and holler for a million population. I bet if you could cut\ninto their heads you\xe2\x80\x99d find that one-third of \xe2\x80\x99em are sure-enough\nsatisfied with their wives and kids and friends and their offices; and\none-third feel kind of restless but won\xe2\x80\x99t admit it; and one-third are\nmiserable and know it. They hate the whole peppy, boosting, go-ahead\ngame, and they\xe2\x80\x99re bored by their wives and think their families are\nfools--at least when they come to forty or forty-five they\xe2\x80\x99re bored--and\nthey hate business, and they\xe2\x80\x99d go-- Why do you suppose there\xe2\x80\x99s so many\n\xe2\x80\x98mysterious\xe2\x80\x99 suicides? Why do you suppose so many Substantial Citizens\njumped right into the war? Think it was all patriotism?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt snorted, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you expect? Think we were sent into the world\nto have a soft time and--what is it?--\xe2\x80\x98float on flowery beds of ease\xe2\x80\x99?\nThink Man was just made to be happy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? Though I\xe2\x80\x99ve never discovered anybody that knew what the deuce\nMan really was made for!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell we know--not just in the Bible alone, but it stands to reason--a\nman who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t buckle down and do his duty, even if it does bore him\nsometimes, is nothing but a--well, he\xe2\x80\x99s simply a weakling. Mollycoddle,\nin fact! And what do you advocate? Come down to cases! If a man is bored\nby his wife, do you seriously mean he has a right to chuck her and take\na sneak, or even kill himself?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what \xe2\x80\x98rights\xe2\x80\x99 a man has! And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the\nsolution of boredom. If I did, I\xe2\x80\x99d be the one philosopher that had the\ncure for living. But I do know that about ten times as many people find\ntheir lives dull, and unnecessarily dull, as ever admit it; and I do\nbelieve that if we busted out and admitted it sometimes, instead of\nbeing nice and patient and loyal for sixty years, and then nice and\npatient and dead for the rest of eternity, why, maybe, possibly, we\nmight make life more fun.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey drifted into a maze of speculation. Babbitt was elephantishly\nuneasy. Paul was bold, but not quite sure about what he was being bold.\nNow and then Babbitt suddenly agreed with Paul in an admission which\ncontradicted all his defense of duty and Christian patience, and at\neach admission he had a curious reckless joy. He said at last:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, old Paul, you do a lot of talking about kicking things in\nthe face, but you never kick. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody does. Habit too strong. But-- Georgie, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking of one\nmild bat--oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, old pillar of monogamy; it\xe2\x80\x99s highly proper.\nIt seems to be settled now, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it--though of course Zilla keeps\nrooting for a nice expensive vacation in New York and Atlantic City,\nwith the bright lights and the bootlegged cocktails and a bunch of\nlounge-lizards to dance with--but the Babbitts and the Rieslings are\nsure-enough going to Lake Sunasquam, aren\xe2\x80\x99t we? Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you and I\nmake some excuse--say business in New York--and get up to Maine four or\nfive days before they do, and just loaf by ourselves and smoke and cuss\nand be natural?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat! Great idea!\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt admired.\n\nNot for fourteen years had he taken a holiday without his wife, and\nneither of them quite believed they could commit this audacity. Many\nmembers of the Athletic Club did go camping without their wives, but\nthey were officially dedicated to fishing and hunting, whereas the\nsacred and unchangeable sports of Babbitt and Paul Riesling were\ngolfing, motoring, and bridge. For either the fishermen or the golfers\nto have changed their habits would have been an infraction of their\nself-imposed discipline which would have shocked all right-thinking and\nregularized citizens.\n\nBabbitt blustered, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t we just put our foot down and say, \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99re\ngoing on ahead of you, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all there is to it!\xe2\x80\x99 Nothing criminal\nin it. Simply say to Zilla--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything to Zilla simply. Why, Georgie, she\xe2\x80\x99s almost as\nmuch of a moralist as you are, and if I told her the truth she\xe2\x80\x99d believe\nwe were going to meet some dames in New York. And even Myra--she never\nnags you, the way Zilla does, but she\xe2\x80\x99d worry. She\xe2\x80\x99d say, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\n_want_ me to go to Maine with you? I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dream of going unless\nyou wanted me;\xe2\x80\x99 and you\xe2\x80\x99d give in to save her feelings. Oh, the devil!\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s have a shot at duck-pins.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDuring the game of duck-pins, a juvenile form of bowling, Paul was\nsilent. As they came down the steps of the club, not more than half an\nhour after the time at which Babbitt had sternly told Miss McGoun he\nwould be back, Paul sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, old man, oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to talked\nabout Zilla way I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRats, old man, it lets off steam.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know! After spending all noon sneering at the conventional stuff,\nI\xe2\x80\x99m conventional enough to be ashamed of saving my life by busting out\nwith my fool troubles!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld Paul, your nerves are kind of on the bum. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take you\naway. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to rig this thing. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have an important deal\nin New York and--and sure, of course!-- I\xe2\x80\x99ll need you to advise me on the\nroof of the building! And the ole deal will fall through, and there\xe2\x80\x99ll\nbe nothing for us but to go on ahead to Maine. I-- Paul, when it comes\nright down to it, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care whether you bust loose or not. I do like\nhaving a rep for being one of the Bunch, but if you ever needed me I\xe2\x80\x99d\nchuck it and come out for you every time! Not of course but what\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re--course I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean you\xe2\x80\x99d ever do anything that would put--that\nwould put a decent position on the fritz but-- See how I mean? I\xe2\x80\x99m kind\nof a clumsy old codger, and I need your fine Eyetalian hand. We-- Oh,\nhell, I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand here gassing all day! On the job! S\xe2\x80\x99 long! Don\xe2\x80\x99t\ntake any wooden money, Paulibus! See you soon! S\xe2\x80\x99 long!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nI\n\nHe forgot Paul Riesling in an afternoon of not unagreeable details.\nAfter a return to his office, which seemed to have staggered on without\nhim, he drove a \xe2\x80\x9cprospect\xe2\x80\x9d out to view a four-flat tenement in the\nLinton district. He was inspired by the customer\xe2\x80\x99s admiration of the new\ncigar-lighter. Thrice its novelty made him use it, and thrice he hurled\nhalf-smoked cigarettes from the car, protesting, \xe2\x80\x9cI _got_ to quit\nsmoking so blame much!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTheir ample discussion of every detail of the cigar-lighter led them to\nspeak of electric flat-irons and bed-warmers. Babbitt apologized for\nbeing so shabbily old-fashioned as still to use a hot-water bottle, and\nhe announced that he would have the sleeping-porch wired at once. He had\nenormous and poetic admiration, though very little understanding, of all\nmechanical devices. They were his symbols of truth and beauty. Regarding\neach new intricate mechanism--metal lathe, two-jet carburetor, machine\ngun, oxyacetylene welder--he learned one good realistic-sounding phrase,\nand used it over and over, with a delightful feeling of being technical\nand initiated.\n\nThe customer joined him in the worship of machinery, and they came\nbuoyantly up to the tenement and began that examination of plastic slate\nroof, kalamein doors, and seven-eighths-inch blind-nailed flooring,\nbegan those diplomacies of hurt surprise and readiness to be persuaded\nto do something they had already decided to do, which would some day\nresult in a sale.\n\nOn the way back Babbitt picked up his partner and father-in-law, Henry\nT. Thompson, at his kitchen-cabinet works, and they drove through South\nZenith, a high-colored, banging, exciting region: new factories of\nhollow tile with gigantic wire-glass windows, surly old red-brick\nfactories stained with tar, high-perched water-tanks, big red trucks\nlike locomotives, and, on a score of hectic side-tracks, far-wandering\nfreight-cars from the New York Central and apple orchards, the Great\nNorthern and wheat-plateaus, the Southern Pacific and orange groves.\n\nThey talked to the secretary of the Zenith Foundry Company about an\ninteresting artistic project--a cast-iron fence for Linden Lane\nCemetery. They drove on to the Zeeco Motor Company and interviewed the\nsales-manager, No\xc3\xabl Ryland, about a discount on a Zeeco car for\nThompson. Babbitt and Ryland were fellow-members of the Boosters\xe2\x80\x99 Club,\nand no Booster felt right if he bought anything from another Booster\nwithout receiving a discount. But Henry Thompson growled, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, t\xe2\x80\x99 hell\nwith \xe2\x80\x99em! I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to crawl around mooching discounts, not from\nnobody.\xe2\x80\x9d It was one of the differences between Thompson, the\nold-fashioned, lean Yankee, rugged, traditional, stage type of American\nbusiness man, and Babbitt, the plump, smooth, efficient,\nup-to-the-minute and otherwise perfected modern. Whenever Thompson\ntwanged, \xe2\x80\x9cPut your John Hancock on that line,\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt was as much\namused by the antiquated provincialism as any proper Englishman by any\nAmerican. He knew himself to be of a breeding altogether more esthetic\nand sensitive than Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s. He was a college graduate, he played\ngolf, he often smoked cigarettes instead of cigars, and when he went to\nChicago he took a room with a private bath. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole thing is,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nexplained to Paul Riesling, \xe2\x80\x9cthese old codgers lack the subtlety that\nyou got to have to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis advance in civilization could be carried too far, Babbitt\nperceived. No\xc3\xabl Ryland, sales-manager of the Zeeco, was a frivolous\ngraduate of Princeton, while Babbitt was a sound and standard ware from\nthat great department-store, the State University. Ryland wore spats, he\nwrote long letters about City Planning and Community Singing, and,\nthough he was a Booster, he was known to carry in his pocket small\nvolumes of poetry in a foreign language. All this was going too far.\nHenry Thompson was the extreme of insularity, and No\xc3\xabl Ryland the\nextreme of frothiness, while between them, supporting the state,\ndefending the evangelical churches and domestic brightness and sound\nbusiness, were Babbitt and his friends.\n\nWith this just estimate of himself--and with the promise of a discount\non Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s car--he returned to his office in triumph.\n\nBut as he went through the corridor of the Reeves Building he sighed,\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor old Paul! I got to-- Oh, damn No\xc3\xabl Ryland! Damn Charley McKelvey!\nJust because they make more money than I do, they think they\xe2\x80\x99re so\nsuperior. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be found dead in their stuffy old Union Club!\nI-- Somehow, to-day, I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like going back to work. Oh well--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nII\n\nHe answered telephone calls, he read the four o\xe2\x80\x99clock mail, he signed\nhis morning\xe2\x80\x99s letters, he talked to a tenant about repairs, he fought\nwith Stanley Graff.\n\nYoung Graff, the outside salesman, was always hinting that he deserved\nan increase of commission, and to-day he complained, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I ought to\nget a bonus if I put through the Heiler sale. I\xe2\x80\x99m chasing around and\nworking on it every single evening, almost.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt frequently remarked to his wife that it was better to \xe2\x80\x9ccon your\noffice-help along and keep \xe2\x80\x99em happy \xe2\x80\x99stead of jumping on \xe2\x80\x99em and poking\n\xe2\x80\x99em up--get more work out of \xe2\x80\x99em that way,\xe2\x80\x9d but this unexampled lack of\nappreciation hurt him, and he turned on Graff:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Stan; let\xe2\x80\x99s get this clear. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got an idea somehow that\nit\xe2\x80\x99s you that do all the selling. Where d\xe2\x80\x99 you get that stuff? Where d\xe2\x80\x99\nyou think you\xe2\x80\x99d be if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for our capital behind you, and our\nlists of properties, and all the prospects we find for you? All you got\nto do is follow up our tips and close the deal. The hall-porter could\nsell Babbitt-Thompson listings! You say you\xe2\x80\x99re engaged to a girl, but\nhave to put in your evenings chasing after buyers. Well, why the devil\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you? What do you want to do? Sit around holding her hand? Let\nme tell you, Stan, if your girl is worth her salt, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad to\nknow you\xe2\x80\x99re out hustling, making some money to furnish the home-nest,\ninstead of doing the lovey-dovey. The kind of fellow that kicks about\nworking overtime, that wants to spend his evenings reading trashy novels\nor spooning and exchanging a lot of nonsense and foolishness with some\ngirl, he ain\xe2\x80\x99t the kind of upstanding, energetic young man, with a\nfuture--and with Vision!--that we want here. How about it? What\xe2\x80\x99s your\nIdeal, anyway? Do you want to make money and be a responsible member of\nthe community, or do you want to be a loafer, with no Inspiration or\nPep?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGraff was not so amenable to Vision and Ideals as usual. \xe2\x80\x9cYou bet I want\nto make money! That\xe2\x80\x99s why I want that bonus! Honest, Mr. Babbitt, I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to get fresh, but this Heiler house is a terror. Nobody\xe2\x80\x99ll\nfall for it. The flooring is rotten and the walls are full of cracks.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I mean! To a salesman with a love for his\nprofession, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard problems like that that inspire him to do his\nbest. Besides, Stan-- Matter o\xe2\x80\x99 fact, Thompson and I are against bonuses,\nas a matter of principle. We like you, and we want to help you so you\ncan get married, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t be unfair to the others on the staff. If\nwe start giving you bonuses, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see we\xe2\x80\x99re going to hurt the\nfeeling and be unjust to Penniman and Laylock? Right\xe2\x80\x99s right, and\ndiscrimination is unfair, and there ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to be any of it in this\noffice! Don\xe2\x80\x99t get the idea, Stan, that because during the war salesmen\nwere hard to hire, now, when there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of men out of work, there\naren\xe2\x80\x99t a slew of bright young fellows that would be glad to step in and\nenjoy your opportunities, and not act as if Thompson and I were his\nenemies and not do any work except for bonuses. How about it, heh? How\nabout it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh--well--gee--of course--\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Graff, as he went out, crabwise.\n\nBabbitt did not often squabble with his employees. He liked to like the\npeople about him; he was dismayed when they did not like him. It was\nonly when they attacked the sacred purse that he was frightened into\nfury, but then, being a man given to oratory and high principles, he\nenjoyed the sound of his own vocabulary and the warmth of his own\nvirtue. To-day he had so passionately indulged in self-approval that he\nwondered whether he had been entirely just:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, Stan isn\xe2\x80\x99t a boy any more. Oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to call him so hard. But\nrats, got to haul folks over the coals now and then for their own good.\nUnpleasant duty, but-- I wonder if Stan is sore? What\xe2\x80\x99s he saying to\nMcGoun out there?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo chill a wind of hatred blew from the outer office that the normal\ncomfort of his evening home-going was ruined. He was distressed by\nlosing that approval of his employees to which an executive is always\nslave. Ordinarily he left the office with a thousand enjoyable fussy\ndirections to the effect that there would undoubtedly be important tasks\nto-morrow, and Miss McGoun and Miss Bannigan would do well to be there\nearly, and for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake remind him to call up Conrad Lyte soon \xe2\x80\x99s\nhe came in. To-night he departed with feigned and apologetic liveliness.\nHe was as afraid of his still-faced clerks--of the eyes focused on him,\nMiss McGoun staring with head lifted from her typing, Miss Bannigan\nlooking over her ledger, Mat Penniman craning around at his desk in the\ndark alcove, Stanley Graff sullenly expressionless--as a parvenu before\nthe bleak propriety of his butler. He hated to expose his back to their\nlaughter, and in his effort to be casually merry he stammered and was\nraucously friendly and oozed wretchedly out of the door.\n\nBut he forgot his misery when he saw from Smith Street the charms of\nFloral Heights; the roofs of red tile and green slate, the shining new\nsun-parlors, and the stainless walls.\n\n\nIII\n\nHe stopped to inform Howard Littlefield, his scholarly neighbor, that\nthough the day had been springlike the evening might be cold. He went in\nto shout \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you?\xe2\x80\x9d at his wife, with no very definite desire to\nknow where she was. He examined the lawn to see whether the furnace-man\nhad raked it properly. With some satisfaction and a good deal of\ndiscussion of the matter with Mrs. Babbitt, Ted, and Howard Littlefield,\nhe concluded that the furnace-man had not raked it properly. He cut two\ntufts of wild grass with his wife\xe2\x80\x99s largest dressmaking-scissors; he\ninformed Ted that it was all nonsense having a furnace-man--\xe2\x80\x9cbig husky\nfellow like you ought to do all the work around the house;\xe2\x80\x9d and\nprivately he meditated that it was agreeable to have it known throughout\nthe neighborhood that he was so prosperous that his son never worked\naround the house.\n\nHe stood on the sleeping-porch and did his day\xe2\x80\x99s exercises: arms out\nsidewise for two minutes, up for two minutes, while he muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cOught\ntake more exercise; keep in shape;\xe2\x80\x9d then went in to see whether his\ncollar needed changing before dinner. As usual it apparently did not.\n\nThe Lettish-Croat maid, a powerful woman, beat the dinner-gong.\n\nThe roast of beef, roasted potatoes, and string beans were excellent\nthis evening and, after an adequate sketch of the day\xe2\x80\x99s progressive\nweather-states, his four-hundred-and-fifty-dollar fee, his lunch with\nPaul Riesling, and the proven merits of the new cigar-lighter, he was\nmoved to a benign, \xe2\x80\x9cSort o\xe2\x80\x99 thinking about buying a new car. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\nbelieve we\xe2\x80\x99ll get one till next year, but still, we might.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVerona, the older daughter, cried, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Dad, if you do, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you\nget a sedan? That would be perfectly slick! A closed car is so much more\ncomfy than an open one.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that. I kind of like an open car. You get\nmore fresh air that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, shoot, that\xe2\x80\x99s just because you never tried a sedan. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get one.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s got a lot more class,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA closed car does keep the clothes nicer,\xe2\x80\x9d from Mrs. Babbitt; \xe2\x80\x9cYou\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t get your hair blown all to pieces,\xe2\x80\x9d from Verona; \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a lot\nsportier,\xe2\x80\x9d from Ted; and from Tinka, the youngest, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, let\xe2\x80\x99s have a\nsedan! Mary Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s father has got one.\xe2\x80\x9d Ted wound up, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, everybody\xe2\x80\x99s\ngot a closed car now, except us!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt faced them: \xe2\x80\x9cI guess you got nothing very terrible to complain\nabout! Anyway, I don\xe2\x80\x99t keep a car just to enable you children to look\nlike millionaires! And I like an open car, so you can put the top down\non summer evenings and go out for a drive and get some good fresh air.\nBesides-- A closed car costs more money.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAw, gee whiz, if the Doppelbraus can afford a closed car, I guess we\ncan!\xe2\x80\x9d prodded Ted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph! I make eight thousand a year to his seven! But I don\xe2\x80\x99t blow it\nall in and waste it and throw it around, the way he does! Don\xe2\x80\x99t believe\nin this business of going and spending a whole lot of money to show off\nand--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey went, with ardor and some thoroughness, into the matters of\nstreamline bodies, hill-climbing power, wire wheels, chrome steel,\nignition systems, and body colors. It was much more than a study of\ntransportation. It was an aspiration for knightly rank. In the city of\nZenith, in the barbarous twentieth century, a family\xe2\x80\x99s motor indicated\nits social rank as precisely as the grades of the peerage determined the\nrank of an English family--indeed, more precisely, considering the\nopinion of old county families upon newly created brewery barons and\nwoolen-mill viscounts. The details of precedence were never officially\ndetermined. There was no court to decide whether the second son of a\nPierce Arrow limousine should go in to dinner before the first son of a\nBuick roadster, but of their respective social importance there was no\ndoubt; and where Babbitt as a boy had aspired to the presidency, his son\nTed aspired to a Packard twin-six and an established position in the\nmotored gentry.\n\nThe favor which Babbitt had won from his family by speaking of a new car\nevaporated as they realized that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t intend to buy one this year.\nTed lamented, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, punk! The old boat looks as if it\xe2\x80\x99d had fleas and\nbeen scratching its varnish off.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Babbitt said abstractedly,\n\xe2\x80\x9cSnoway talkcher father.\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt raged, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re too much of a\nhigh-class gentleman, and you belong to the _bon ton_ and so on, why,\nyou needn\xe2\x80\x99t take the car out this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d Ted explained, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nmean--\xe2\x80\x9d and dinner dragged on with normal domestic delight to the\ninevitable point at which Babbitt protested, \xe2\x80\x9cCome, come now, we can\xe2\x80\x99t\nsit here all evening. Give the girl a chance to clear away the table.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe was fretting, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a family! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how we all get to\nscrapping this way. Like to go off some place and be able to hear myself\nthink.... Paul... Maine.... Wear old pants, and loaf, and cuss.\xe2\x80\x9d He said\ncautiously to his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been in correspondence with a man in New\nYork--wants me to see him about a real-estate trade--may not come off\ntill summer. Hope it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t break just when we and the Rieslings get\nready to go to Maine. Be a shame if we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make the trip there\ntogether. Well, no use worrying now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVerona escaped, immediately after dinner, with no discussion save an\nautomatic \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you ever stay home?\xe2\x80\x9d from Babbitt.\n\nIn the living-room, in a corner of the davenport, Ted settled down to\nhis Home Study; plain geometry, Cicero, and the agonizing metaphors of\nComus.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why they give us this old-fashioned junk by Milton and\nShakespeare and Wordsworth and all these has-beens,\xe2\x80\x9d he protested. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\nI guess I could stand it to see a show by Shakespeare, if they had swell\nscenery and put on a lot of dog, but to sit down in cold blood and\n_read_ \xe2\x80\x99em-- These teachers--how do they get that way?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMrs. Babbitt, darning socks, speculated, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I wonder why. Of course I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to fly in the face of the professors and everybody, but I do\nthink there\xe2\x80\x99s things in Shakespeare--not that I read him much, but when\nI was young the girls used to show me passages that weren\xe2\x80\x99t, really,\nthey weren\xe2\x80\x99t at all nice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt looked up irritably from the comic strips in the _Evening\nAdvocate_. They composed his favorite literature and art, these\nillustrated chronicles in which Mr. Mutt hit Mr. Jeff with a rotten egg,\nand Mother corrected Father\xe2\x80\x99s vulgarisms by means of a rolling-pin. With\nthe solemn face of a devotee, breathing heavily through his open mouth,\nhe plodded nightly through every picture, and during the rite he\ndetested interruptions. Furthermore, he felt that on the subject of\nShakespeare he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really an authority. Neither the _Advocate-Times_,\nthe _Evening Advocate_, nor the _Bulletin of the Zenith Chamber of\nCommerce_ had ever had an editorial on the matter, and until one of them\nhad spoken he found it hard to form an original opinion. But even at\nrisk of floundering in strange bogs, he could not keep out of an open\ncontroversy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you why you have to study Shakespeare and those. It\xe2\x80\x99s because\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re required for college entrance, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all there is to it!\nPersonally, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see myself why they stuck \xe2\x80\x99em into an up-to-date\nhigh-school system like we have in this state. Be a good deal better if\nyou took Business English, and learned how to write an ad, or letters\nthat would pull. But there it is, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no talk, argument, or\ndiscussion about it! Trouble with you, Ted, is you always want to do\nsomething different! If you\xe2\x80\x99re going to law-school--and you are!-- I\nnever had a chance to, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll see that you do--why, you\xe2\x80\x99ll want to\nlay in all the English and Latin you can get.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh punk. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of law-school--or even finishing\nhigh school. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to college specially. Honest, there\xe2\x80\x99s\nlot of fellows that have graduated from colleges that don\xe2\x80\x99t begin to\nmake as much money as fellows that went to work early. Old Shimmy\nPeters, that teaches Latin in the High, he\xe2\x80\x99s a what-is-it from Columbia\nand he sits up all night reading a lot of greasy books and he\xe2\x80\x99s always\nspieling about the \xe2\x80\x98value of languages,\xe2\x80\x99 and the poor soak doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make\nbut eighteen hundred a year, and no traveling salesman would think of\nworking for that. I know what I\xe2\x80\x99d like to do. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to be an aviator,\nor own a corking big garage, or else--a fellow was telling me about it\nyesterday-- I\xe2\x80\x99d like to be one of these fellows that the Standard Oil\nCompany sends out to China, and you live in a compound and don\xe2\x80\x99t have to\ndo any work, and you get to see the world and pagodas and the ocean and\neverything! And then I could take up correspondence-courses. That\xe2\x80\x99s the\nreal stuff! You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to recite to some frosty-faced old dame\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s trying to show off to the principal, and you can study any\nsubject you want to. Just listen to these! I clipped out the ads of some\nswell courses.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe snatched from the back of his geometry half a hundred advertisements\nof those home-study courses which the energy and foresight of American\ncommerce have contributed to the science of education. The first\ndisplayed the portrait of a young man with a pure brow, an iron jaw,\nsilk socks, and hair like patent leather. Standing with one hand in his\ntrousers-pocket and the other extended with chiding forefinger, he was\nbewitching an audience of men with gray beards, paunches, bald heads,\nand every other sign of wisdom and prosperity. Above the picture was an\ninspiring educational symbol--no antiquated lamp or torch or owl of\nMinerva, but a row of dollar signs. The text ran:\n\n\n                           $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $\n\n                POWER AND PROSPERITY IN PUBLIC SPEAKING\n\n                        A Yarn Told at the Club\n\nWho do you think I ran into the other evening at the De Luxe Restaurant?\nWhy, old Freddy Durkee, that used to be a dead-or-alive shipping clerk\nin my old place-- Mr. Mouse-Man we used to laughingly call the dear\nfellow. One time he was so timid he was plumb scared of the Super, and\nnever got credit for the dandy work he did. Him at the De Luxe! And if\nhe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ordering a tony feed with all the \xe2\x80\x9cfixings\xe2\x80\x9d from celery to\nnuts! And instead of being embarrassed by the waiters, like he used to\nbe at the little dump where we lunched in Old Lang Syne, he was bossing\nthem around like he was a millionaire!\n\n     WHAT WE TEACH YOU!\n\n     How to address your lodge.\n\n     How to give toasts.\n\n     How to tell dialect stories.\n\n     How to propose to a lady.\n\n     How to entertain banquets.\n\n     How to make convincing selling-talks.\n\n     How to build big vocabulary.\n\n     How to create a strong personality.\n\n     How to become a rational, powerful and original thinker.\n\n     How to be a MASTER MAN!\n\nI cautiously asked him what he was doing. Freddy laughed and said, \xe2\x80\x9cSay,\nold chum, I guess you\xe2\x80\x99re wondering what\xe2\x80\x99s come over me. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad\nto know I\xe2\x80\x99m now Assistant Super at the old shop, and right on the High\nRoad to Prosperity and Domination, and I look forward with confidence to\na twelve-cylinder car, and the wife is making things hum in the best\nsociety and the kiddies getting a first-class education.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s how it happened. I ran across an ad of a course that claimed to\nteach people how to talk easily and on their feet, how to answer\ncomplaints, how to lay a proposition before the Boss, how to hit a bank\nfor a loan, how to hold a big audience spellbound with wit, humor,\nanecdote, inspiration, etc. It was compiled by the Master Orator, Prof.\nWaldo F. Peet. I was skeptical, too, but I wrote (just _on a postcard_,\nwith name and address) to the publisher for the lessons--sent On Trial,\nmoney back if you are not absolutely satisfied. There were eight simple\nlessons in plain language anybody could understand, and I studied them\njust a few hours a night, then started practising on the wife. Soon\nfound I could talk right up to the Super and get due credit for all the\ngood work I did. They began to appreciate me and advance me fast, and\nsay, old doggo, what do you think they\xe2\x80\x99re paying me now? $6,500 per\nyear! And say, I find I can keep a big audience fascinated, speaking on\nany topic.

A\n     graduate of some of our leading universities, lecturer, extensive\n     traveler, author of books, poetry, etc., a man with the unique\n     PERSONALITY OF THE MASTER MINDS, he is ready to give _YOU_ all the\n     secrets of his culture and hammering Force, in a few easy lessons\n     that will not interfere with other occupations.\n\nBabbitt was again without a canon which would enable him to speak with\nauthority. Nothing in motoring or real estate had indicated what a Solid\nCitizen and Regular Fellow ought to think about culture by mail. He\nbegan with hesitation:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--sounds as if it covered the ground. It certainly is a fine thing\nto be able to orate. I\xe2\x80\x99ve sometimes thought I had a little talent that\nway myself, and I know darn well that one reason why a fourflushing old\nback-number like Chan Mott can get away with it in real estate is just\nbecause he can make a good talk, even when he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got a doggone thing\nto say! And it certainly is pretty cute the way they get out all these\ncourses on various topics and subjects nowadays. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, though:\nNo need to blow in a lot of good money on this stuff when you can get a\nfirst-rate course in eloquence and English and all that right in your\nown school--and one of the biggest school buildings in the entire\ncountry!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Babbitt comfortably, while Ted complained:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYuh, but Dad, they just teach a lot of old junk that isn\xe2\x80\x99t any\npractical use--except the manual training and typewriting and basketball\nand dancing--and in these correspondence-courses, gee, you can get all\nkinds of stuff that would come in handy. Say, listen to this one:\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCAN YOU PLAY A MAN\xe2\x80\x99S PART?\n\nIf you are walking with your mother, sister or best\ngirl and some one passes a slighting remark or uses\nimproper language, won\xe2\x80\x99t you be ashamed if you can\xe2\x80\x99t\ntake her part? Well, can you?\n\nWe teach boxing and self-defense by mail. Many\npupils have written saying that after a few lessons\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve outboxed bigger and heavier opponents. The\nlessons start with simple movements practised before\nyour mirror--holding out your hand for a coin, the\nbreast-stroke in swimming, etc. Before you realize it\nyou are striking scientifically, ducking, guarding and\nfeinting, just as if you had a real opponent before you.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, baby, maybe I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like that!\xe2\x80\x9d Ted chanted. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell the\nworld! Gosh, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to take one fellow I know in school that\xe2\x80\x99s always\nshooting off his mouth, and catch him alone--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! The idea! Most useless thing I ever heard of!\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt\nfulminated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, just suppose I was walking with Mama or Rone, and somebody passed\na slighting remark or used improper language. What would I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99d probably bust the record for the hundred-yard dash!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _would_ not! I\xe2\x80\x99d stand right up to any mucker that passed a slighting\nremark on _my_ sister and I\xe2\x80\x99d show him--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, young Dempsey! If I ever catch you fighting I\xe2\x80\x99ll whale the\neverlasting daylights out of you--and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it without practising\nholding out my hand for a coin before the mirror, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Ted dear,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Babbitt said placidly, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s not at all nice, your\ntalking of fighting this way!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, gosh almighty, that\xe2\x80\x99s a fine way to appreciate-- And then suppose\nI was walking with _you_, Ma, and somebody passed a slighting remark--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody\xe2\x80\x99s going to pass no slighting remarks on nobody,\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt\nobserved, \xe2\x80\x9cnot if they stay home and study their geometry and mind their\nown affairs instead of hanging around a lot of poolrooms and\nsoda-fountains and places where nobody\xe2\x80\x99s got any business to be!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut gooooooosh, Dad, if they DID!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMrs. Babbitt chirped, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if they did, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do them the honor\nof paying any attention to them! Besides, they never do. You always hear\nabout these women that get followed and insulted and all, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nbelieve a word of it, or it\xe2\x80\x99s their own fault, the way some women look\nat a person. I certainly never\xe2\x80\x99ve been insulted by--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAw shoot, Mother, just suppose you _were_ sometime! Just _suppose_!\nCan\xe2\x80\x99t you suppose something? Can\xe2\x80\x99t you imagine things?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I can imagine things! The idea!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly your mother can imagine things--and suppose things! Think\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re the only member of this household that\xe2\x80\x99s got an imagination?\xe2\x80\x9d\nBabbitt demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of a lot of supposing? Supposing\nnever gets you anywhere. No sense supposing when there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of real\nfacts to take into considera--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Dad. Suppose-- I mean, just--just suppose you were in your\noffice and some rival real-estate man--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRealtor!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c--some realtor that you hated came in--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t hate any realtor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut suppose you _did_!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t intend to suppose anything of the kind! There\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of\nfellows in my profession that stoop and hate their competitors, but if\nyou were a little older and understood business, instead of always going\nto the movies and running around with a lot of fool girls with their\ndresses up to their knees and powdered and painted and rouged and God\nknows what all as if they were chorus-girls, then you\xe2\x80\x99d know--and you\xe2\x80\x99d\nsuppose--that if there\xe2\x80\x99s any one thing that I stand for in the\nreal-estate circles of Zenith, it is that we ought to always speak of\neach other only in the friendliest terms and institute a spirit of\nbrotherhood and co\xc3\xb6peration, and so I certainly can\xe2\x80\x99t suppose and I\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t imagine my hating any realtor, not even that dirty, fourflushing\nsociety sneak, Cecil Rountree!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s no If, And or But about it! But if I _were_ going to\nlambaste somebody, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t require any fancy ducks or\nswimming-strokes before a mirror, or any of these doodads and flipflops!\nSuppose you were out some place and a fellow called you vile names.\nThink you\xe2\x80\x99d want to box and jump around like a dancing-master? You\xe2\x80\x99d\njust lay him out cold (at least I certainly hope any son of mine would!)\nand then you\xe2\x80\x99d dust off your hands and go on about your business, and\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all there is to it, and you aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to have any\nboxing-lessons by mail, either!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell but-- Yes-- I just wanted to show how many different kinds of\ncorrespondence-courses there are, instead of all the camembert they\nteach us in the High.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought they taught boxing in the school gymnasium.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s different. They stick you up there and some big stiff amuses\nhimself pounding the stuffin\xe2\x80\x99s out of you before you have a chance to\nlearn. Hunka! Not any! But anyway-- Listen to some of these others.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe advertisements were truly philanthropic. One of them bore the\nrousing headline: \xe2\x80\x9cMoney! Money!! Money!!!\xe2\x80\x9d The second announced that\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. P. R., formerly making only eighteen a week in a barber shop,\nwrites to us that since taking our course he is now pulling down $5,000\nas an Osteo-vitalic Physician;\xe2\x80\x9d and the third that \xe2\x80\x9cMiss J. L., recently\na wrapper in a store, is now getting Ten Real Dollars a day teaching our\nHindu System of Vibratory Breathing and Mental Control.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTed had collected fifty or sixty announcements, from annual\nreference-books, from Sunday School periodicals, fiction-magazines, and\njournals of discussion. One benefactor implored, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be a\nWallflower-- Be More Popular and Make More Money-- You Can Ukulele or Sing\nYourself into Society! By the secret principles of a Newly Discovered\nSystem of Music Teaching, any one--man, lady or child--can, without\ntiresome exercises, special training or long drawn out study, and\nwithout waste of time, money or energy, learn to play by note, piano,\nbanjo, cornet, clarinet, saxophone, violin or drum, and learn\nsight-singing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe next, under the wistful appeal \xe2\x80\x9cFinger Print Detectives Wanted-- Big\nIncomes!\xe2\x80\x9d confided: \xe2\x80\x9cYOU red-blooded men and women--this is the\nPROFESSION you have been looking for. There\xe2\x80\x99s MONEY in it, BIG money,\nand that rapid change of scene, that entrancing and compelling interest\nand fascination, which your active mind and adventurous spirit crave.\nThink of being the chief figure and directing factor in solving strange\nmysteries and baffling crimes. This wonderful profession brings you into\ncontact with influential men on the basis of equality, and often calls\nupon you to travel everywhere, maybe to distant lands--all expenses\npaid. NO SPECIAL EDUCATION REQUIRED.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, boy! I guess that wins the fire-brick necklace! Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be\nswell to travel everywhere and nab some famous crook!\xe2\x80\x9d whooped Ted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think much of that. Doggone likely to get hurt. Still,\nthat music-study stunt might be pretty fair, though. There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason\nwhy, if efficiency-experts put their minds to it the way they have to\nrouting products in a factory, they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t figure out some scheme so a\nperson wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to monkey with all this practising and exercises\nthat you get in music.\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt was impressed, and he had a delightful\nparental feeling that they two, the men of the family, understood each\nother.\n\nHe listened to the notices of mail-box universities which taught\nShort-story Writing and Improving the Memory, Motion-picture-acting and\nDeveloping the Soul-power, Banking and Spanish, Chiropody and\nPhotography, Electrical Engineering and Window-trimming, Poultry-raising\nand Chemistry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--well--\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt sought for adequate expression of his admiration.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a son of a gun! I knew this correspondence-school business had\nbecome a mighty profitable game--makes suburban real-estate look like\ntwo cents!--but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize it\xe2\x80\x99d got to be such a reg\xe2\x80\x99lar\nkey-industry! Must rank right up with groceries and movies. Always\nfigured somebody\xe2\x80\x99d come along with the brains to not leave education to\na lot of bookworms and impractical theorists but make a big thing out\nof it. Yes, I can see how a lot of these courses might interest you. I\nmust ask the fellows at the Athletic if they ever realized-- But same\ntime, Ted, you know how advertisers, I means some advertisers,\nexaggerate. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know as they\xe2\x80\x99d be able to jam you through these\ncourses as fast as they claim they can.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh sure, Dad; of course.\xe2\x80\x9d Ted had the immense and joyful maturity of a\nboy who is respectfully listened to by his elders. Babbitt concentrated\non him with grateful affection:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can see what an influence these courses might have on the whole\neducational works. Course I\xe2\x80\x99d never admit it publicly--fellow like\nmyself, a State U. graduate, it\xe2\x80\x99s only decent and patriotic for him to\nblow his horn and boost the Alma Mater--but smatter of fact, there\xe2\x80\x99s a\nwhole lot of valuable time lost even at the U., studying poetry and\nFrench and subjects that never brought in anybody a cent. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\nbut what maybe these correspondence-courses might prove to be one of the\nmost important American inventions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrouble with a lot of folks is: they\xe2\x80\x99re so blame material; they don\xe2\x80\x99t\nsee the spiritual and mental side of American supremacy; they think that\ninventions like the telephone and the areoplane and wireless--no, that\nwas a Wop invention, but anyway: they think these mechanical\nimprovements are all that we stand for; whereas to a real thinker, he\nsees that spiritual and, uh, dominating movements like Efficiency, and\nRotarianism, and Prohibition, and Democracy are what compose our deepest\nand truest wealth. And maybe this new principle in education-at-home may\nbe another--may be another factor. I tell you, Ted, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have\nVision--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think those correspondence-courses are terrible!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe philosophers gasped. It was Mrs. Babbitt who had made this discord\nin their spiritual harmony, and one of Mrs. Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s virtues was that,\nexcept during dinner-parties, when she was transformed into a raging\nhostess, she took care of the house and didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother the males by\nthinking. She went on firmly:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds awful to me, the way they coax those poor young folks to\nthink they\xe2\x80\x99re learning something, and nobody \xe2\x80\x99round to help them\nand-- You two learn so quick, but me, I always was slow. But just the\nsame--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt attended to her: \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! Get just as much, studying at home.\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t think a fellow learns any more because he blows in his\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s hard-earned money and sits around in Morris chairs in a swell\nHarvard dormitory with pictures and shields and table-covers and those\ndoodads, do you? I tell you, I\xe2\x80\x99m a college man-- I _know_! There is one\nobjection you might make though. I certainly do protest against any\neffort to get a lot of fellows out of barber shops and factories into\nthe professions. They\xe2\x80\x99re too crowded already, and what\xe2\x80\x99ll we do for\nworkmen if all those fellows go and get educated?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTed was leaning back, smoking a cigarette without reproof. He was, for\nthe moment, sharing the high thin air of Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s speculation as though\nhe were Paul Riesling or even Dr. Howard Littlefield. He hinted:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what do you think then, Dad? Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be a good idea if I\ncould go off to China or some peppy place, and study engineering or\nsomething by mail?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you why, son. I\xe2\x80\x99ve found out it\xe2\x80\x99s a mighty nice thing\nto be able to say you\xe2\x80\x99re a B.A. Some client that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\nare and thinks you\xe2\x80\x99re just a plug business man, he gets to shooting off\nhis mouth about economics or literature or foreign trade conditions, and\nyou just ease in something like, \xe2\x80\x98When I was in college--course I got my\nB.A. in sociology and all that junk--\xe2\x80\x99 Oh, it puts an awful crimp in\ntheir style! But there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be any class to saying \xe2\x80\x98I got the degree\nof Stamp-licker from the Bezuzus Mail-order University!\xe2\x80\x99 You see-- My\ndad was a pretty good old coot, but he never had much style to him, and\nI had to work darn hard to earn my way through college. Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s been\nworth it, to be able to associate with the finest gentlemen in Zenith,\nat the clubs and so on, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want you to drop out of the\ngentlemen class--the class that are just as red-blooded as the Common\nPeople but still have power and personality. It would kind of hurt me if\nyou did that, old man!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, Dad! Sure! All right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll stick to it. Say! Gosh! Gee whiz! I\nforgot all about those kids I was going to take to the chorus rehearsal.\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll have to duck!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you haven\xe2\x80\x99t done all your home-work.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo it first thing in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSix times in the past sixty days Babbitt had stormed, \xe2\x80\x9cYou will not \xe2\x80\x98do\nit first thing in the morning\xe2\x80\x99! You\xe2\x80\x99ll do it right now!\xe2\x80\x9d but to-night he\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, better hustle,\xe2\x80\x9d and his smile was the rare shy radiance he\nkept for Paul Riesling.\n\n\nIV\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTed\xe2\x80\x99s a good boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Mrs. Babbitt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he is!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s these girls he\xe2\x80\x99s going to pick up? Are they nice decent girls?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Oh dear, Ted never tells me anything any more. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nunderstand what\xe2\x80\x99s come over the children of this generation. I used to\nhave to tell Papa and Mama everything, but seems like the children\nto-day have just slipped away from all control.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope they\xe2\x80\x99re decent girls. Course Ted\xe2\x80\x99s no longer a kid, and I\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want him to, uh, get mixed up and everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge: I wonder if you oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to take him aside and tell him\nabout-- Things!\xe2\x80\x9d She blushed and lowered her eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Way I figure it, Myra, no sense suggesting a lot of\nThings to a boy\xe2\x80\x99s mind. Think up enough devilment by himself. But I\nwonder-- It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a hard question. Wonder what Littlefield thinks\nabout it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourse Papa agrees with you. He says all this--Instruction--is-- He says\n\xe2\x80\x99tisn\xe2\x80\x99t decent.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he does, does he! Well, let me tell you that whatever Henry T.\nThompson thinks--about morals, I mean, though course you can\xe2\x80\x99t beat the\nold duffer--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what a way to talk of Papa!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c--simply can\xe2\x80\x99t beat him at getting in on the ground floor of a deal,\nbut let me tell you whenever he springs any ideas about higher things\nand education, then I know I think just the opposite. You may not regard\nme as any great brain-shark, but believe me, I\xe2\x80\x99m a regular college\npresident, compared with Henry T.! Yes sir, by golly, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take\nTed aside and tell him why I lead a strictly moral life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, will you? When?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen? When? What\xe2\x80\x99s the use of trying to pin me down to When and Why and\nWhere and How and When? That\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble with women, that\xe2\x80\x99s why they\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t make high-class executives; they haven\xe2\x80\x99t any sense of diplomacy.\nWhen the proper opportunity and occasion arises so it just comes in\nnatural, why then I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a friendly little talk with him\nand--and-- Was that Tinka hollering up-stairs? She ought to been asleep,\nlong ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe prowled through the living-room, and stood in the sun-parlor, that\nglass-walled room of wicker chairs and swinging couch in which they\nloafed on Sunday afternoons. Outside, only the lights of Doppelbrau\xe2\x80\x99s\nhouse and the dim presence of Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s favorite elm broke the softness\nof April night.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood visit with the boy. Getting over feeling cranky, way I did this\nmorning. And restless. Though, by golly, I will have a few days alone\nwith Paul in Maine!... That devil Zilla!... But.... Ted\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\nWhole family all right. And good business. Not many fellows make four\nhundred and fifty bucks, practically half of a thousand dollars, easy as\nI did to-day! Maybe when we all get to rowing it\xe2\x80\x99s just as much my\nfault as it is theirs. Oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to get grouchy like I do. But-- Wish I\xe2\x80\x99d\nbeen a pioneer, same as my grand-dad. But then, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a house\nlike this. I-- Oh, gosh, _I don\xe2\x80\x99t know_!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe thought moodily of Paul Riesling, of their youth together, of the\ngirls they had known.\n\nWhen Babbitt had graduated from the State University, twenty-four years\nago, he had intended to be a lawyer. He had been a ponderous debater in\ncollege; he felt that he was an orator; he saw himself becoming governor\nof the state. While he read law he worked as a real-estate salesman. He\nsaved money, lived in a boarding-house, supped on poached egg on hash.\nThe lively Paul Riesling (who was certainly going off to Europe to study\nviolin, next month or next year) was his refuge till Paul was bespelled\nby Zilla Colbeck, who laughed and danced and drew men after her plump\nand gaily wagging finger.\n\nBabbitt\xe2\x80\x99s evenings were barren then, and he found comfort only in Paul\xe2\x80\x99s\nsecond cousin, Myra Thompson, a sleek and gentle girl who showed her\ncapacity by agreeing with the ardent young Babbitt that of course he was\ngoing to be governor some day. Where Zilla mocked him as a country boy,\nMyra said indignantly that he was ever so much solider than the young\ndandies who had been born in the great city of Zenith--an ancient\nsettlement in 1897, one hundred and five years old, with two hundred\nthousand population, the queen and wonder of all the state and, to the\nCatawba boy, George Babbitt, so vast and thunderous and luxurious that\nhe was flattered to know a girl ennobled by birth in Zenith.\n\nOf love there was no talk between them. He knew that if he was to study\nlaw he could not marry for years; and Myra was distinctly a Nice\nGirl--one didn\xe2\x80\x99t kiss her, one didn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cthink about her that way at all\xe2\x80\x9d\nunless one was going to marry her. But she was a dependable companion.\nShe was always ready to go skating, walking; always content to hear his\ndiscourses on the great things he was going to do, the distressed poor\nwhom he would defend against the Unjust Rich, the speeches he would make\nat Banquets, the inexactitudes of popular thought which he would\ncorrect.\n\nOne evening when he was weary and soft-minded, he saw that she had been\nweeping. She had been left out of a party given by Zilla. Somehow her\nhead was on his shoulder and he was kissing away the tears--and she\nraised her head to say trustingly, \xe2\x80\x9cNow that we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged, shall we be\nmarried soon or shall we wait?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEngaged? It was his first hint of it. His affection for this brown\ntender woman thing went cold and fearful, but he could not hurt her,\ncould not abuse her trust. He mumbled something about waiting, and\nescaped. He walked for an hour, trying to find a way of telling her that\nit was a mistake. Often, in the month after, he got near to telling her,\nbut it was pleasant to have a girl in his arms, and less and less could\nhe insult her by blurting that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t love her. He himself had no\ndoubt. The evening before his marriage was an agony, and the morning\nwild with the desire to flee.\n\nShe made him what is known as a Good Wife. She was loyal, industrious,\nand at rare times merry. She passed from a feeble disgust at their\ncloser relations into what promised to be ardent affection, but it\ndrooped into bored routine. Yet she existed only for him and for the\nchildren, and she was as sorry, as worried as himself, when he gave up\nthe law and trudged on in a rut of listing real estate.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor kid, she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had much better time than I have,\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt\nreflected, standing in the dark sun-parlor. \xe2\x80\x9cBut-- I wish I could\xe2\x80\x99ve had\na whirl at law and politics. Seen what I could do. Well-- Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ve made\nmore money as it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe returned to the living-room but before he settled down he smoothed\nhis wife\xe2\x80\x99s hair, and she glanced up, happy and somewhat surprised.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nI\n\nHe solemnly finished the last copy of the _American Magazine_, while his\nwife sighed, laid away her darning, and looked enviously at the lingerie\ndesigns in a women\xe2\x80\x99s magazine. The room was very still.\n\nIt was a room which observed the best Floral Heights standards. The gray\nwalls were divided into artificial paneling by strips of white-enameled\npine. From the Babbitts\xe2\x80\x99 former house had come two much-carved\nrocking-chairs, but the other chairs were new, very deep and restful,\nupholstered in blue and gold-striped velvet. A blue velvet davenport\nfaced the fireplace, and behind it was a cherrywood table and a tall\npiano-lamp with a shade of golden silk. (Two out of every three houses\nin Floral Heights had before the fireplace a davenport, a mahogany table\nreal or imitation, and a piano-lamp or a reading-lamp with a shade of\nyellow or rose silk.)\n\nOn the table was a runner of gold-threaded Chinese fabric, four\nmagazines, a silver box containing cigarette-crumbs, and three\n\xe2\x80\x9cgift-books\xe2\x80\x9d--large, expensive editions of fairy-tales illustrated by\nEnglish artists and as yet unread by any Babbitt save Tinka.\n\nIn a corner by the front windows was a large cabinet Victrola. (Eight\nout of every nine Floral Heights houses had a cabinet phonograph.)\n\nAmong the pictures, hung in the exact center of each gray panel, were a\nred and black imitation English hunting-print, an anemic imitation\nboudoir-print with a French caption of whose morality Babbitt had always\nbeen rather suspicious, and a \xe2\x80\x9chand-colored\xe2\x80\x9d photograph of a Colonial\nroom--rag rug, maiden spinning, cat demure before a white fireplace.\n(Nineteen out of every twenty houses in Floral Heights had either a\nhunting-print, a _Madame Fait la Toilette_ print, a colored photograph\nof a New England house, a photograph of a Rocky Mountain, or all four.)\n\nIt was a room as superior in comfort to the \xe2\x80\x9cparlor\xe2\x80\x9d of Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s\nboyhood as his motor was superior to his father\xe2\x80\x99s buggy. Though there\nwas nothing in the room that was interesting, there was nothing that was\noffensive. It was as neat, and as negative, as a block of artificial\nice. The fireplace was unsoftened by downy ashes or by sooty brick; the\nbrass fire-irons were of immaculate polish; and the grenadier andirons\nwere like samples in a shop, desolate, unwanted, lifeless things of\ncommerce.\n\nAgainst the wall was a piano, with another piano-lamp, but no one used\nit save Tinka. The hard briskness of the phonograph contented them;\ntheir store of jazz records made them feel wealthy and cultured; and all\nthey knew of creating music was the nice adjustment of a bamboo needle.\nThe books on the table were unspotted and laid in rigid parallels; not\none corner of the carpet-rug was curled; and nowhere was there a\nhockey-stick, a torn picture-book, an old cap, or a gregarious and\ndisorganizing dog.\n\n\nII\n\nAt home, Babbitt never read with absorption. He was concentrated enough\nat the office but here he crossed his legs and fidgeted. When his story\nwas interesting he read the best, that is the funniest, paragraphs to\nhis wife; when it did not hold him he coughed, scratched his ankles and\nhis right ear, thrust his left thumb into his vest pocket, jingled his\nsilver, whirled the cigar-cutter and the keys on one end of his\nwatch-chain, yawned, rubbed his nose, and found errands to do. He went\nupstairs to put on his slippers--his elegant slippers of seal-brown,\nshaped like medieval shoes. He brought up an apple from the barrel which\nstood by the trunk-closet in the basement.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn apple a day keeps the doctor away,\xe2\x80\x9d he enlightened Mrs. Babbitt, for\nquite the first time in fourteen hours.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn apple is Nature\xe2\x80\x99s best regulator.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrouble with women is, they never have sense enough to form regular\nhabits.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways nibbling and eating between meals.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge!\xe2\x80\x9d She looked up from her reading. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you have a light lunch\nto-day, like you were going to? I did!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis malicious and unprovoked attack astounded him. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, maybe it\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t as light as-- Went to lunch with Paul and didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much chance\nto diet. Oh, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t to grin like a chessy cat! If it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for me\nwatching out and keeping an eye on our diet-- I\xe2\x80\x99m the only member of this\nfamily that appreciates the value of oatmeal for breakfast. I--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe stooped over her story while he piously sliced and gulped down the\napple, discoursing:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve done: cut down my smoking.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad kind of a run-in with Graff in the office. He\xe2\x80\x99s getting too darn\nfresh. I\xe2\x80\x99ll stand for a good deal, but once in a while I got to assert\nmy authority, and I jumped him. \xe2\x80\x98Stan,\xe2\x80\x99 I said-- Well, I told him just\nexactly where he got off.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFunny kind of a day. Makes you feel restless.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWellllllllll, uh--\xe2\x80\x9d That sleepiest sound in the world, the terminal\nyawn. Mrs. Babbitt yawned with it, and looked grateful as he droned,\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow about going to bed, eh? Don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose Rone and Ted will be in till\nall hours. Yep, funny kind of a day; not terribly warm but yet-- Gosh,\nI\xe2\x80\x99d like-- Some day I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take a long motor trip.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we\xe2\x80\x99d enjoy that,\xe2\x80\x9d she yawned.\n\nHe looked away from her as he realized that he did not wish to have her\ngo with him. As he locked doors and tried windows and set the heat\nregulator so that the furnace-drafts would open automatically in the\nmorning, he sighed a little, heavy with a lonely feeling which perplexed\nand frightened him. So absent-minded was he that he could not remember\nwhich window-catches he had inspected, and through the darkness,\nfumbling at unseen perilous chairs, he crept back to try them all over\nagain. His feet were loud on the steps as he clumped upstairs at the end\nof this great and treacherous day of veiled rebellions.\n\n\nIII\n\nBefore breakfast he always reverted to up-state village boyhood, and\nshrank from the complex urban demands of shaving, bathing, deciding\nwhether the current shirt was clean enough for another day. Whenever he\nstayed home in the evening he went to bed early, and thriftily got ahead\nin those dismal duties. It was his luxurious custom to shave while\nsitting snugly in a tubful of hot water. He may be viewed to-night as a\nplump, smooth, pink, baldish, podgy goodman, robbed of the importance of\nspectacles, squatting in breast-high water, scraping his lather-smeared\ncheeks with a safety-razor like a tiny lawn-mower, and with melancholy\ndignity clawing through the water to recover a slippery and active piece\nof soap.\n\nHe was lulled to dreaming by the caressing warmth. The light fell on the\ninner surface of the tub in a pattern of delicate wrinkled lines which\nslipped with a green sparkle over the curving porcelain as the clear\nwater trembled. Babbitt lazily watched it; noted that along the\nsilhouette of his legs against the radiance on the bottom of the tub,\nthe shadows of the air-bubbles clinging to the hairs were reproduced as\nstrange jungle mosses. He patted the water, and the reflected light\ncapsized and leaped and volleyed. He was content and childish. He\nplayed. He shaved a swath down the calf of one plump leg.\n\nThe drain-pipe was dripping, a dulcet and lively song: drippety drip\ndrip dribble, drippety drip drip drip. He was enchanted by it. He looked\nat the solid tub, the beautiful nickel taps, the tiled walls of the\nroom, and felt virtuous in the possession of this splendor.\n\nHe roused himself and spoke gruffly to his bath-things. \xe2\x80\x9cCome here!\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve done enough fooling!\xe2\x80\x9d he reproved the treacherous soap, and\ndefied the scratchy nail-brush with \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you would, would you!\xe2\x80\x9d He\nsoaped himself, and rinsed himself, and austerely rubbed himself; he\nnoted a hole in the Turkish towel, and meditatively thrust a finger\nthrough it, and marched back to the bedroom, a grave and unbending\ncitizen.\n\nThere was a moment of gorgeous abandon, a flash of melodrama such as he\nfound in traffic-driving, when he laid out a clean collar, discovered\nthat it was frayed in front, and tore it up with a magnificent yeeeeeing\nsound.\n\nMost important of all was the preparation of his bed and the\nsleeping-porch.\n\nIt is not known whether he enjoyed his sleeping-porch because of the\nfresh air or because it was the standard thing to have a sleeping-porch.\n\nJust as he was an Elk, a Booster, and a member of the Chamber of\nCommerce, just as the priests of the Presbyterian Church determined his\nevery religious belief and the senators who controlled the Republican\nParty decided in little smoky rooms in Washington what he should think\nabout disarmament, tariff, and Germany, so did the large national\nadvertisers fix the surface of his life, fix what he believed to be his\nindividuality. These standard advertised wares--toothpastes, socks,\ntires, cameras, instantaneous hot-water heaters--were his symbols and\nproofs of excellence; at first the signs, then the substitutes, for joy\nand passion and wisdom.\n\nBut none of these advertised tokens of financial and social success was\nmore significant than a sleeping-porch with a sun-parlor below.\n\nThe rites of preparing for bed were elaborate and unchanging. The\nblankets had to be tucked in at the foot of his cot. (Also, the reason\nwhy the maid hadn\xe2\x80\x99t tucked in the blankets had to be discussed with Mrs.\nBabbitt.) The rag rug was adjusted so that his bare feet would strike it\nwhen he arose in the morning. The alarm clock was wound. The hot-water\nbottle was filled and placed precisely two feet from the bottom of the\ncot.\n\nThese tremendous undertakings yielded to his determination; one by one\nthey were announced to Mrs. Babbitt and smashed through to\naccomplishment. At last his brow cleared, and in his \xe2\x80\x9cGnight!\xe2\x80\x9d rang\nvirile power. But there was yet need of courage. As he sank into sleep,\njust at the first exquisite relaxation, the Doppelbrau car came home. He\nbounced into wakefulness, lamenting, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy the devil can\xe2\x80\x99t some people\nnever get to bed at a reasonable hour?\xe2\x80\x9d So familiar was he with the\nprocess of putting up his own car that he awaited each step like an able\nexecutioner condemned to his own rack.\n\nThe car insultingly cheerful on the driveway. The car door opened and\nbanged shut, then the garage door slid open, grating on the sill, and\nthe car door again. The motor raced for the climb up into the garage and\nraced once more, explosively, before it was shut off. A final opening\nand slamming of the car door. Silence then, a horrible silence filled\nwith waiting, till the leisurely Mr. Doppelbrau had examined the state\nof his tires and had at last shut the garage door. Instantly, for\nBabbitt, a blessed state of oblivion.\n\n\nIV\n\nAt that moment in the city of Zenith, Horace Updike was making love to\nLucile McKelvey in her mauve drawing-room on Royal Ridge, after their\nreturn from a lecture by an eminent English novelist. Updike was\nZenith\xe2\x80\x99s professional bachelor; a slim-waisted man of forty-six with an\neffeminate voice and taste in flowers, cretonnes, and flappers. Mrs.\nMcKelvey was red-haired, creamy, discontented, exquisite, rude, and\nhonest. Updike tried his invariable first maneuver--touching her nervous\nwrist.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be an idiot!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mind awfully?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! That\xe2\x80\x99s what I mind!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe changed to conversation. He was famous at conversation. He spoke\nreasonably of psychoanalysis, Long Island polo, and the Ming platter he\nhad found in Vancouver. She promised to meet him in Deauville, the\ncoming summer, \xe2\x80\x9cthough,\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s becoming too dreadfully\nbanal; nothing but Americans and frowsy English baronesses.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd at that moment in Zenith, a cocaine-runner and a prostitute were\ndrinking cocktails in Healey Hanson\xe2\x80\x99s saloon on Front Street. Since\nnational prohibition was now in force, and since Zenith was notoriously\nlaw-abiding, they were compelled to keep the cocktails innocent by\ndrinking them out of tea-cups. The lady threw her cup at the\ncocaine-runner\xe2\x80\x99s head. He worked his revolver out of the pocket in his\nsleeve, and casually murdered her.\n\nAt that moment in Zenith, two men sat in a laboratory. For thirty-seven\nhours now they had been working on a report of their investigations of\nsynthetic rubber.\n\nAt that moment in Zenith, there was a conference of four union officials\nas to whether the twelve thousand coal-miners within a hundred miles of\nthe city should strike. Of these men one resembled a testy and\nprosperous grocer, one a Yankee carpenter, one a soda-clerk, and one a\nRussian Jewish actor. The Russian Jew quoted Kautsky, Gene Debs, and\nAbraham Lincoln.\n\nAt that moment a G. A. R. veteran was dying. He had come from the Civil\nWar straight to a farm which, though it was officially within the\ncity-limits of Zenith, was primitive as the backwoods. He had never\nridden in a motor car, never seen a bath-tub, never read any book save\nthe Bible, McGuffey\xe2\x80\x99s readers, and religious tracts; and he believed\nthat the earth is flat, that the English are the Lost Ten Tribes of\nIsrael, and that the United States is a democracy.\n\nAt that moment the steel and cement town which composed the factory of\nthe Pullmore Tractor Company of Zenith was running on night shift to\nfill an order of tractors for the Polish army. It hummed like a million\nbees, glared through its wide windows like a volcano. Along the high\nwire fences, searchlights played on cinder-lined yards, switch-tracks,\nand armed guards on patrol.\n\nAt that moment Mike Monday was finishing a meeting. Mr. Monday, the\ndistinguished evangelist, the best-known Protestant pontiff in America,\nhad once been a prize-fighter. Satan had not dealt justly with him. As a\nprize-fighter he gained nothing but his crooked nose, his celebrated\nvocabulary, and his stage-presence. The service of the Lord had been\nmore profitable. He was about to retire with a fortune. It had been well\nearned, for, to quote his last report, \xe2\x80\x9cRev. Mr. Monday, the Prophet\nwith a Punch, has shown that he is the world\xe2\x80\x99s greatest salesman of\nsalvation, and that by efficient organization the overhead of spiritual\nregeneration may be kept down to an unprecedented rock-bottom basis. He\nhas converted over two hundred thousand lost and priceless souls at an\naverage cost of less than ten dollars a head.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOf the larger cities of the land, only Zenith had hesitated to submit\nits vices to Mike Monday and his expert reclamation corps. The more\nenterprising organizations of the city had voted to invite him-- Mr.\nGeorge F. Babbitt had once praised him in a speech at the Boosters\xe2\x80\x99\nClub. But there was opposition from certain Episcopalian and\nCongregationalist ministers, those renegades whom Mr. Monday so finely\ncalled \xe2\x80\x9ca bunch of gospel-pushers with dish-water instead of blood, a\ngang of squealers that need more dust on the knees of their pants and\nmore hair on their skinny old chests.\xe2\x80\x9d This opposition had been crushed\nwhen the secretary of the Chamber of Commerce had reported to a\ncommittee of manufacturers that in every city where he had appeared, Mr.\nMonday had turned the minds of workmen from wages and hours to higher\nthings, and thus averted strikes. He was immediately invited.\n\nAn expense fund of forty thousand dollars had been underwritten; out on\nthe County Fair Grounds a Mike Monday Tabernacle had been erected, to\nseat fifteen thousand people. In it the prophet was at this moment\nconcluding his message:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of smart college professors and tea-guzzling slobs in\nthis burg that say I\xe2\x80\x99m a roughneck and a never-wuzzer and my knowledge\nof history is not-yet. Oh, there\xe2\x80\x99s a gang of woolly-whiskered book-lice\nthat think they know more than Almighty God, and prefer a lot of Hun\nscience and smutty German criticism to the straight and simple Word of\nGod. Oh, there\xe2\x80\x99s a swell bunch of Lizzie boys and lemon-suckers and\npie-faces and infidels and beer-bloated scribblers that love to fire off\ntheir filthy mouths and yip that Mike Monday is vulgar and full of mush.\nThose pups are saying now that I hog the gospel-show, that I\xe2\x80\x99m in it for\nthe coin. Well, now listen, folks! I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give those birds a\nchance! They can stand right up here and tell me to my face that I\xe2\x80\x99m a\ngaloot and a liar and a hick! Only if they do--if they do!--don\xe2\x80\x99t faint\nwith surprise if some of those rum-dumm liars get one good swift poke\nfrom Mike, with all the kick of God\xe2\x80\x99s Flaming Righteousness behind the\nwallop! Well, come on, folks! Who says it? Who says Mike Monday is a\nfourflush and a yahoo? Huh? Don\xe2\x80\x99t I see anybody standing up? Well, there\nyou are! Now I guess the folks in this man\xe2\x80\x99s town will quit listening to\nall this kyoodling from behind the fence; I guess you\xe2\x80\x99ll quit listening\nto the guys that pan and roast and kick and beef, and vomit out filthy\natheism; and all of you\xe2\x80\x99ll come in, with every grain of pep and\nreverence you got, and boost all together for Jesus Christ and his\neverlasting mercy and tenderness!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nV\n\nAt that moment Seneca Doane, the radical lawyer, and Dr. Kurt Yavitch,\nthe histologist (whose report on the destruction of epithelial cells\nunder radium had made the name of Zenith known in Munich, Prague, and\nRome), were talking in Doane\xe2\x80\x99s library.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cZenith\xe2\x80\x99s a city with gigantic power--gigantic buildings, gigantic\nmachines, gigantic transportation,\xe2\x80\x9d meditated Doane.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate your city. It has standardized all the beauty out of life. It is\none big railroad station--with all the people taking tickets for the\nbest cemeteries,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Yavitch said placidly.\n\nDoane roused. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m hanged if it is! You make me sick, Kurt, with your\nperpetual whine about \xe2\x80\x98standardization.\xe2\x80\x99 Don\xe2\x80\x99t you suppose any other\nnation is \xe2\x80\x98standardized?\xe2\x80\x99 Is anything more standardized than England,\nwith every house that can afford it having the same muffins at the same\ntea-hour, and every retired general going to exactly the same evensong\nat the same gray stone church with a square tower, and every golfing\nprig in Harris tweeds saying \xe2\x80\x98Right you are!\xe2\x80\x99 to every other prosperous\nass? Yet I love England. And for standardization--just look at the\nsidewalk caf\xc3\xa9s in France and the love-making in Italy!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStandardization is excellent, _per se_. When I buy an Ingersoll watch\nor a Ford, I get a better tool for less money, and I know precisely what\nI\xe2\x80\x99m getting, and that leaves me more time and energy to be individual\nin. And-- I remember once in London I saw a picture of an American\nsuburb, in a toothpaste ad on the back of the _Saturday Evening\nPost_--an elm-lined snowy street of these new houses, Georgian some of\n\xe2\x80\x99em, or with low raking roofs and-- The kind of street you\xe2\x80\x99d find here in\nZenith, say in Floral Heights. Open. Trees. Grass. And I was homesick!\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no other country in the world that has such pleasant houses. And\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t care if they _are_ standardized. It\xe2\x80\x99s a corking standard!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, what I fight in Zenith is standardization of thought, and, of\ncourse, the traditions of competition. The real villains of the piece\nare the clean, kind, industrious Family Men who use every known brand of\ntrickery and cruelty to insure the prosperity of their cubs. The worst\nthing about these fellows is that they\xe2\x80\x99re so good and, in their work at\nleast, so intelligent. You can\xe2\x80\x99t hate them properly, and yet their\nstandardized minds are the enemy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen this boosting-- Sneakingly I have a notion that Zenith is a better\nplace to live in than Manchester or Glasgow or Lyons or Berlin or\nTurin--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not, and I have lift in most of them,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Dr. Yavitch.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, matter of taste. Personally, I prefer a city with a future so\nunknown that it excites my imagination. But what I particularly want--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Yavitch, \xe2\x80\x9care a middle-road liberal, and you haven\xe2\x80\x99t the\nslightest idea what you want. I, being a revolutionist, know exactly\nwhat I want--and what I want now is a drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nVI\n\nAt that moment in Zenith, Jake Offutt, the politician, and Henry T.\nThompson were in conference. Offutt suggested, \xe2\x80\x9cThe thing to do is to\nget your fool son-in-law, Babbitt, to put it over. He\xe2\x80\x99s one of these\npatriotic guys. When he grabs a piece of property for the gang, he makes\nit look like we were dyin\xe2\x80\x99 of love for the dear peepul, and I do love to\nbuy respectability--reasonable. Wonder how long we can keep it up, Hank?\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re safe as long as the good little boys like George Babbitt and all\nthe nice respectable labor-leaders think you and me are rugged patriots.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s swell pickings for an honest politician here, Hank: a whole city\nworking to provide cigars and fried chicken and dry martinis for us, and\nrallying to our banner with indignation, oh, fierce indignation,\nwhenever some squealer like this fellow Seneca Doane comes along!\nHonest, Hank, a smart codger like me ought to be ashamed of himself if\nhe didn\xe2\x80\x99t milk cattle like them, when they come around mooing for it!\nBut the Traction gang can\xe2\x80\x99t get away with grand larceny like it used to.\nI wonder when-- Hank, I wish we could fix some way to run this fellow\nSeneca Doane out of town. It\xe2\x80\x99s him or us!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt that moment in Zenith, three hundred and forty or fifty thousand\nOrdinary People were asleep, a vast unpenetrated shadow. In the slum\nbeyond the railroad tracks, a young man who for six months had sought\nwork turned on the gas and killed himself and his wife.\n\nAt that moment Lloyd Mallam, the poet, owner of the Hafiz Book Shop, was\nfinishing a rondeau to show how diverting was life amid the feuds of\nmedieval Florence, but how dull it was in so obvious a place as Zenith.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd at that moment George F. Babbitt turned ponderously in bed--the last\nturn, signifying that he\xe2\x80\x99d had enough of this worried business of\nfalling asleep and was about it in earnest.\n\nInstantly he was in the magic dream. He was somewhere among unknown\npeople who laughed at him. He slipped away, ran down the paths of a\nmidnight garden, and at the gate the fairy child was waiting. Her dear\nand tranquil hand caressed his cheek. He was gallant and wise and\nwell-beloved; warm ivory were her arms; and beyond perilous moors the\nbrave sea glittered.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nI\n\nThe great events of Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s spring were the secret buying of\nreal-estate options in Linton for certain street-traction officials,\nbefore the public announcement that the Linton Avenue Car Line would be\nextended, and a dinner which was, as he rejoiced to his wife, not only\n\xe2\x80\x9ca regular society spread but a real sure-enough highbrow affair, with\nsome of the keenest intellects and the brightest bunch of little women\nin town.\xe2\x80\x9d It was so absorbing an occasion that he almost forgot his\ndesire to run off to Maine with Paul Riesling.\n\nThough he had been born in the village of Catawba, Babbitt had risen to\nthat metropolitan social plane on which hosts have as many as four\npeople at dinner without planning it for more than an evening or two.\nBut a dinner of twelve, with flowers from the florist\xe2\x80\x99s and all the\ncut-glass out, staggered even the Babbitts.\n\nFor two weeks they studied, debated, and arbitrated the list of guests.\n\nBabbitt marveled, \xe2\x80\x9cOf course we\xe2\x80\x99re up-to-date ourselves, but still,\nthink of us entertaining a famous poet like Chum Frink, a fellow that on\nnothing but a poem or so every day and just writing a few advertisements\npulls down fifteen thousand berries a year!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and Howard Littlefield. Do you know, the other evening Eunice told\nme her papa speaks three languages!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Babbitt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh! That\xe2\x80\x99s nothing! So do I--American, baseball, and poker!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to be funny about a matter like that. Think\nhow wonderful it must be to speak three languages, and so useful\nand-- And with people like that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why we invite the Orville\nJoneses.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, Orville is a mighty up-and-coming fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know, but-- A laundry!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll admit a laundry hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got the class of poetry or real estate, but\njust the same, Orvy is mighty deep. Ever start him spieling about\ngardening? Say, that fellow can tell you the name of every kind of tree,\nand some of their Greek and Latin names too! Besides, we owe the Joneses\na dinner. Besides, gosh, we got to have some boob for audience, when a\nbunch of hot-air artists like Frink and Littlefield get going.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, dear--I meant to speak of this--I do think that as host you ought\nto sit back and listen, and let your guests have a chance to talk once\nin a while!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you do, do you! Sure! I talk all the time! And I\xe2\x80\x99m just a business\nman--oh sure!--I\xe2\x80\x99m no Ph.D. like Littlefield, and no poet, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\nanything to spring! Well, let me tell you, just the other day your darn\nChum Frink comes up to me at the club begging to know what I thought\nabout the Springfield school-bond issue. And who told him? I did! You\nbet your life I told him! Little me! I certainly did! He came up and\nasked me, and I told him all about it! You bet! And he was darn glad to\nlisten to me and-- Duty as a host! I guess I know my duty as a host and\nlet me tell you--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn fact, the Orville Joneses were invited.\n\n\nII\n\nOn the morning of the dinner, Mrs. Babbitt was restive.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, George, I want you to be sure and be home early to-night.\nRemember, you have to dress.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUh-huh. I see by the _Advocate_ that the Presbyterian General Assembly\nhas voted to quit the Interchurch World Movement. That--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge! Did you hear what I said? You must be home in time to dress\nto-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDress? Hell! I\xe2\x80\x99m dressed now! Think I\xe2\x80\x99m going down to the office in my\nB.V.D.\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not have you talking indecently before the children! And you do\nhave to put on your dinner-jacket!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess you mean my Tux. I tell you, of all the doggone nonsensical\nnuisances that was ever invented--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThree minutes later, after Babbitt had wailed, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\nwhether I\xe2\x80\x99m going to dress or _not_\xe2\x80\x9d in a manner which showed that he\nwas going to dress, the discussion moved on.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, George, you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t forget to call in at Vecchia\xe2\x80\x99s on the way home\nand get the ice cream. Their delivery-wagon is broken down, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nwant to trust them to send it by--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right! You told me that before breakfast!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to forget. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be working my head off all day\nlong, training the girl that\xe2\x80\x99s to help with the dinner--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll nonsense, anyway, hiring an extra girl for the feed. Matilda could\nperfectly well--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c--and I have to go out and buy the flowers, and fix them, and set the\ntable, and order the salted almonds, and look at the chickens, and\narrange for the children to have their supper up-stairs and-- And I\nsimply must depend on you to go to Vecchia\xe2\x80\x99s for the ice cream.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll riiiiiight! Gosh, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll you have to do is to go in and say you want the ice cream that Mrs.\nBabbitt ordered yesterday by \xe2\x80\x99phone, and it will be all ready for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt ten-thirty she telephoned to him not to forget the ice cream from\nVecchia\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\nHe was surprised and blasted then by a thought. He wondered whether\nFloral Heights dinners were worth the hideous toil involved. But he\nrepented the sacrilege in the excitement of buying the materials for\ncocktails.\n\nNow this was the manner of obtaining alcohol under the reign of\nrighteousness and prohibition:\n\nHe drove from the severe rectangular streets of the modern business\ncenter into the tangled byways of Old Town--jagged blocks filled with\nsooty warehouses and lofts; on into The Arbor, once a pleasant orchard\nbut now a morass of lodging-houses, tenements, and brothels. Exquisite\nshivers chilled his spine and stomach, and he looked at every policeman\nwith intense innocence, as one who loved the law, and admired the Force,\nand longed to stop and play with them. He parked his car a block from\nHealey Hanson\xe2\x80\x99s saloon, worrying, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, rats, if anybody did see me,\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d think I was here on business.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe entered a place curiously like the saloons of ante-prohibition days,\nwith a long greasy bar with sawdust in front and streaky mirror behind,\na pine table at which a dirty old man dreamed over a glass of something\nwhich resembled whisky, and with two men at the bar, drinking something\nwhich resembled beer, and giving that impression of forming a large\ncrowd which two men always give in a saloon. The bartender, a tall pale\nSwede with a diamond in his lilac scarf, stared at Babbitt as he stalked\nplumply up to the bar and whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d, uh-- Friend of Hanson\xe2\x80\x99s sent\nme here. Like to get some gin.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe bartender gazed down on him in the manner of an outraged bishop. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nguess you got the wrong place, my friend. We sell nothing but soft\ndrinks here.\xe2\x80\x9d He cleaned the bar with a rag which would itself have done\nwith a little cleaning, and glared across his mechanically moving elbow.\n\nThe old dreamer at the table petitioned the bartender, \xe2\x80\x9cSay, Oscar,\nlisten.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOscar did not listen.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAw, say, Oscar, listen, will yuh? Say, lis-sen!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe decayed and drowsy voice of the loafer, the agreeable stink of\nbeer-dregs, threw a spell of inanition over Babbitt. The bartender moved\ngrimly toward the crowd of two men. Babbitt followed him as delicately\nas a cat, and wheedled, \xe2\x80\x9cSay, Oscar, I want to speak to Mr. Hanson.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhajuh wanta see him for?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just want to talk to him. Here\xe2\x80\x99s my card.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was a beautiful card, an engraved card, a card in the blackest black\nand the sharpest red, announcing that Mr. George F. Babbitt was Estates,\nInsurance, Rents. The bartender held it as though it weighed ten pounds,\nand read it as though it were a hundred words long. He did not bend from\nhis episcopal dignity, but he growled, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll see if he\xe2\x80\x99s around.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFrom the back room he brought an immensely old young man, a quiet\nsharp-eyed man, in tan silk shirt, checked vest hanging open, and\nburning brown trousers--Mr. Healey Hanson. Mr. Hanson said only \xe2\x80\x9cYuh?\xe2\x80\x9d\nbut his implacable and contemptuous eyes queried Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s soul, and he\nseemed not at all impressed by the new dark-gray suit for which (as he\nhad admitted to every acquaintance at the Athletic Club) Babbitt had\npaid a hundred and twenty-five dollars.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlad meet you, Mr. Hanson. Say, uh-- I\xe2\x80\x99m George Babbitt of the\nBabbitt-Thompson Realty Company. I\xe2\x80\x99m a great friend of Jake Offutt\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have a party, and Jake told me you\xe2\x80\x99d be able to\nfix me up with a little gin.\xe2\x80\x9d In alarm, in obsequiousness, as Hanson\xe2\x80\x99s\neyes grew more bored, \xe2\x80\x9cYou telephone to Jake about me, if you want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHanson answered by jerking his head to indicate the entrance to the back\nroom, and strolled away. Babbitt melodramatically crept into an\napartment containing four round tables, eleven chairs, a brewery\ncalendar, and a smell. He waited. Thrice he saw Healey Hanson saunter\nthrough, humming, hands in pockets, ignoring him.\n\nBy this time Babbitt had modified his valiant morning vow, \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t pay\none cent over seven dollars a quart\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cI might pay ten.\xe2\x80\x9d On Hanson\xe2\x80\x99s\nnext weary entrance he besought, \xe2\x80\x9cCould you fix that up?\xe2\x80\x9d Hanson\nscowled, and grated, \xe2\x80\x9cJust a minute--Pete\xe2\x80\x99s sake--just a min-ute!\xe2\x80\x9d In\ngrowing meekness Babbitt went on waiting till Hanson casually reappeared\nwith a quart of gin--what is euphemistically known as a quart--in his\ndisdainful long white hands.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwelve bucks,\xe2\x80\x9d he snapped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, uh, but say, cap\xe2\x80\x99n, Jake thought you\xe2\x80\x99d be able to fix me up for\neight or nine a bottle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNup. Twelve. This is the real stuff, smuggled from Canada. This is none\no\xe2\x80\x99 your neutral spirits with a drop of juniper extract,\xe2\x80\x9d the honest\nmerchant said virtuously. \xe2\x80\x9cTwelve bones--if you want it. Course y\xe2\x80\x99\nunderstand I\xe2\x80\x99m just doing this anyway as a friend of Jake\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure! Sure! I understand!\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt gratefully held out twelve dollars.\nHe felt honored by contact with greatness as Hanson yawned, stuffed the\nbills, uncounted, into his radiant vest, and swaggered away.\n\nHe had a number of titillations out of concealing the gin-bottle under\nhis coat and out of hiding it in his desk. All afternoon he snorted and\nchuckled and gurgled over his ability to \xe2\x80\x9cgive the Boys a real shot in\nthe arm to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d He was, in fact, so exhilarated that he was within a\nblock of his house before he remembered that there was a certain matter,\nmentioned by his wife, of fetching ice cream from Vecchia\xe2\x80\x99s. He\nexplained, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, darn it--\xe2\x80\x9d and drove back.\n\nVecchia was not a caterer, he was The Caterer of Zenith. Most coming-out\nparties were held in the white and gold ballroom of the Maison Vecchia;\nat all nice teas the guests recognized the five kinds of Vecchia\nsandwiches and the seven kinds of Vecchia cakes; and all really smart\ndinners ended, as on a resolving chord, in Vecchia Neapolitan ice cream\nin one of the three reliable molds--the melon mold, the round mold like\na layer cake, and the long brick.\n\nVecchia\xe2\x80\x99s shop had pale blue woodwork, tracery of plaster roses,\nattendants in frilled aprons, and glass shelves of \xe2\x80\x9ckisses\xe2\x80\x9d with all the\nrefinement that inheres in whites of eggs. Babbitt felt heavy and thick\namid this professional daintiness, and as he waited for the ice cream he\ndecided, with hot prickles at the back of his neck, that a girl customer\nwas giggling at him. He went home in a touchy temper. The first thing he\nheard was his wife\xe2\x80\x99s agitated:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge! _Did_ you remember to go to Vecchia\xe2\x80\x99s and get the ice cream?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay! Look here! Do I ever forget to do things?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! Often!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, it\xe2\x80\x99s darn seldom I do, and it certainly makes me tired, after\ngoing into a pink-tea joint like Vecchia\xe2\x80\x99s and having to stand around\nlooking at a lot of half-naked young girls, all rouged up like they were\nsixty and eating a lot of stuff that simply ruins their stomachs--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s too bad about you! I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed how you hate to look at pretty\ngirls!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith a jar Babbitt realized that his wife was too busy to be impressed\nby that moral indignation with which males rule the world, and he went\nhumbly up-stairs to dress. He had an impression of a glorified\ndining-room, of cut-glass, candles, polished wood, lace, silver, roses.\nWith the awed swelling of the heart suitable to so grave a business as\ngiving a dinner, he slew the temptation to wear his plaited dress-shirt\nfor a fourth time, took out an entirely fresh one, tightened his black\nbow, and rubbed his patent-leather pumps with a handkerchief. He glanced\nwith pleasure at his garnet and silver studs. He smoothed and patted his\nankles, transformed by silk socks from the sturdy shanks of George\nBabbitt to the elegant limbs of what is called a Clubman. He stood\nbefore the pier-glass, viewing his trim dinner-coat, his beautiful\ntriple-braided trousers; and murmured in lyric beatitude, \xe2\x80\x9cBy golly, I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t look so bad. I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t look like Catawba. If the hicks\nback home could see me in this rig, they\xe2\x80\x99d have a fit!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe moved majestically down to mix the cocktails. As he chipped ice, as\nhe squeezed oranges, as he collected vast stores of bottles, glasses,\nand spoons at the sink in the pantry, he felt as authoritative as the\nbartender at Healey Hanson\xe2\x80\x99s saloon. True, Mrs. Babbitt said he was\nunder foot, and Matilda and the maid hired for the evening brushed by\nhim, elbowed him, shrieked \xe2\x80\x9cPleasopn door,\xe2\x80\x9d as they tottered through\nwith trays, but in this high moment he ignored them.\n\nBesides the new bottle of gin, his cellar consisted of one half-bottle\nof Bourbon whisky, a quarter of a bottle of Italian vermouth, and\napproximately one hundred drops of orange bitters. He did not possess a\ncocktail-shaker. A shaker was proof of dissipation, the symbol of a\nDrinker, and Babbitt disliked being known as a Drinker even more than he\nliked a Drink. He mixed by pouring from an ancient gravy-boat into a\nhandleless pitcher; he poured with a noble dignity, holding his alembics\nhigh beneath the powerful Mazda globe, his face hot, his shirt-front a\nglaring white, the copper sink a scoured red-gold.\n\nHe tasted the sacred essence. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, by golly, if that isn\xe2\x80\x99t pretty near\none fine old cocktail! Kind of a Bronx, and yet like a Manhattan.\nUmmmmmm! Hey, Myra, want a little nip before the folks come?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBustling into the dining-room, moving each glass a quarter of an inch,\nrushing back with resolution implacable on her face, her gray and\nsilver-lace party frock protected by a denim towel, Mrs. Babbitt glared\nat him, and rebuked him, \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d in a loose, jocose manner, \xe2\x80\x9cI think the old man will!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe cocktail filled him with a whirling exhilaration behind which he was\naware of devastating desires--to rush places in fast motors, to kiss\ngirls, to sing, to be witty. He sought to regain his lost dignity by\nannouncing to Matilda:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to stick this pitcher of cocktails in the refrigerator. Be\nsure you don\xe2\x80\x99t upset any of \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeh.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, be sure now. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go putting anything on this top shelf.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeh.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, be--\xe2\x80\x9d He was dizzy. His voice was thin and distant. \xe2\x80\x9cWhee!\xe2\x80\x9d With\nenormous impressiveness he commanded, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, be sure now,\xe2\x80\x9d and minced\ninto the safety of the living-room. He wondered whether he could\npersuade \xe2\x80\x9cas slow a bunch as Myra and the Littlefields to go some place\naft\xe2\x80\x99 dinner and raise Cain and maybe dig up smore booze.\xe2\x80\x9d He perceived\nthat he had gifts of profligacy which had been neglected.\n\nBy the time the guests had come, including the inevitable late couple\nfor whom the others waited with painful amiability, a great gray\nemptiness had replaced the purple swirling in Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s head, and he had\nto force the tumultuous greetings suitable to a host on Floral Heights.\n\nThe guests were Howard Littlefield, the doctor of philosophy who\nfurnished publicity and comforting economics to the Street Traction\nCompany; Vergil Gunch, the coal-dealer, equally powerful in the Elks and\nin the Boosters\xe2\x80\x99 Club; Eddie Swanson, the agent for the Javelin Motor\nCar, who lived across the street; and Orville Jones, owner of the Lily\nWhite Laundry, which justly announced itself \xe2\x80\x9cthe biggest, busiest,\nbulliest cleanerie shoppe in Zenith.\xe2\x80\x9d But, naturally, the most\ndistinguished of all was T. Cholmondeley Frink, who was not only the\nauthor of \xe2\x80\x9cPoemulations,\xe2\x80\x9d which, syndicated daily in sixty-seven leading\nnewspapers, gave him one of the largest audiences of any poet in the\nworld, but also an optimistic lecturer and the creator of \xe2\x80\x9cAds that\nAdd.\xe2\x80\x9d Despite the searching philosophy and high morality of his verses,\nthey were humorous and easily understood by any child of twelve; and it\nadded a neat air of pleasantry to them that they were set not as verse\nbut as prose. Mr. Frink was known from Coast to Coast as \xe2\x80\x9cChum.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith them were six wives, more or less--it was hard to tell, so early in\nthe evening, as at first glance they all looked alike, and as they all\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, _isn\xe2\x80\x99t_ this nice!\xe2\x80\x9d in the same tone of determined\nliveliness. To the eye, the men were less similar: Littlefield, a\nhedge-scholar, tall and horse-faced; Chum Frink, a trifle of a man with\nsoft and mouse-like hair, advertising his profession as poet by a silk\ncord on his eye-glasses; Vergil Gunch, broad, with coarse black hair _en\nbrosse_; Eddie Swanson, a bald and bouncing young man who showed his\ntaste for elegance by an evening waistcoat of figured black silk with\nglass buttons; Orville Jones, a steady-looking, stubby, not very\nmemorable person, with a hemp-colored toothbrush mustache. Yet they were\nall so well fed and clean, they all shouted \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Evenin\xe2\x80\x99, Georgie!\xe2\x80\x9d with\nsuch robustness, that they seemed to be cousins, and the strange thing\nis that the longer one knew the women, the less alike they seemed; while\nthe longer one knew the men, the more alike their bold patterns\nappeared.\n\nThe drinking of the cocktails was as canonical a rite as the mixing. The\ncompany waited, uneasily, hopefully, agreeing in a strained manner that\nthe weather had been rather warm and slightly cold, but still Babbitt\nsaid nothing about drinks. They became despondent. But when the late\ncouple (the Swansons) had arrived, Babbitt hinted, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, folks, do you\nthink you could stand breaking the law a little?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey looked at Chum Frink, the recognized lord of language. Frink pulled\nat his eye-glass cord as at a bell-rope, he cleared his throat and said\nthat which was the custom:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, George: I\xe2\x80\x99m a law-abiding man, but they do say Verg\nGunch is a regular yegg, and of course he\xe2\x80\x99s bigger \xe2\x80\x99n I am, and I just\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t figure out what I\xe2\x80\x99d do if he tried to force me into anything\ncriminal!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGunch was roaring, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a chance--\xe2\x80\x9d when Frink held up his\nhand and went on, \xe2\x80\x9cSo if Verg and you insist, Georgie, I\xe2\x80\x99ll park my car\non the wrong side of the street, because I take it for granted that\xe2\x80\x99s\nthe crime you\xe2\x80\x99re hinting at!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere was a great deal of laughter. Mrs. Jones asserted, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Frink is\nsimply too killing! You\xe2\x80\x99d think he was so innocent!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt clamored, \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you guess it, Chum? Well, you-all just wait a\nmoment while I go out and get the--keys to your cars!\xe2\x80\x9d Through a froth\nof merriment he brought the shining promise, the mighty tray of glasses\nwith the cloudy yellow cocktails in the glass pitcher in the center. The\nmen babbled, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, gosh, have a look!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThis gets me right where I\nlive!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cLet me at it!\xe2\x80\x9d But Chum Frink, a traveled man and not unused\nto woes, was stricken by the thought that the potion might be merely\nfruit-juice with a little neutral spirits. He looked timorous as\nBabbitt, a moist and ecstatic almoner, held out a glass, but as he\ntasted it he piped, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, man, let me dream on! It ain\xe2\x80\x99t true, but don\xe2\x80\x99t\nwaken me! Jus\xe2\x80\x99 lemme slumber!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwo hours before, Frink had completed a newspaper lyric beginning:\n\n_I sat alone and groused and thunk, and scratched my head and sighed and\nwunk, and groaned, \xe2\x80\x9cThere still are boobs, alack, who\xe2\x80\x99d like the\nold-time gin-mill back; that den that makes a sage a loon, the vile and\nsmelly old saloon!\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99ll never miss their poison booze, whilst I the\nbubbling spring can use, that leaves my head at merry morn as clear as\nany babe new-born!_\n\nBabbitt drank with the others; his moment\xe2\x80\x99s depression was gone; he\nperceived that these were the best fellows in the world; he wanted to\ngive them a thousand cocktails. \xe2\x80\x9cThink you could stand another?\xe2\x80\x9d he\ncried. The wives refused, with giggles, but the men, speaking in a\nwide, elaborate, enjoyable manner, gloated, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, sooner than have you\nget sore at me, Georgie--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou got a little dividend coming,\xe2\x80\x9d said Babbitt to each of them, and\neach intoned, \xe2\x80\x9cSqueeze it, Georgie, squeeze it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen, beyond hope, the pitcher was empty, they stood and talked about\nprohibition. The men leaned back on their heels, put their hands in\ntheir trousers-pockets, and proclaimed their views with the booming\nprofundity of a prosperous male repeating a thoroughly hackneyed\nstatement about a matter of which he knows nothing whatever.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vergil Gunch; \xe2\x80\x9cway I figure it is this, and I\ncan speak by the book, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to a lot of doctors and\nfellows that ought to know, and the way I see it is that it\xe2\x80\x99s a good\nthing to get rid of the saloon, but they ought to let a fellow have beer\nand light wines.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHoward Littlefield observed, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat isn\xe2\x80\x99t generally realized is that it\xe2\x80\x99s\na dangerous prop\xe2\x80\x99sition to invade the rights of personal liberty. Now,\ntake this for instance: The King of-- Bavaria? I think it was\nBavaria--yes, Bavaria, it was--in 1862, March, 1862, he issued a\nproclamation against public grazing of live-stock. The peasantry had\nstood for overtaxation without the slightest complaint, but when this\nproclamation came out, they rebelled. Or it may have been Saxony. But it\njust goes to show the dangers of invading the rights of personal\nliberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it--no one got a right to invade personal liberty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Orville\nJones.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust the same, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to forget prohibition is a mighty good\nthing for the working-classes. Keeps \xe2\x80\x99em from wasting their money and\nlowering their productiveness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vergil Gunch.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s so. But the trouble is the manner of enforcement,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted\nHoward Littlefield. \xe2\x80\x9cCongress didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand the right system. Now,\nif I\xe2\x80\x99d been running the thing, I\xe2\x80\x99d have arranged it so that the drinker\nhimself was licensed, and then we could have taken care of the shiftless\nworkman--kept him from drinking--and yet not\xe2\x80\x99ve interfered with the\nrights--with the personal liberty--of fellows like ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey bobbed their heads, looked admiringly at one another, and stated,\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so, that would be the stunt.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe thing that worries me is that a lot of these guys will take to\ncocaine,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Eddie Swanson.\n\nThey bobbed more violently, and groaned, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so, there is a danger\nof that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nChum Frink chanted, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, say, I got hold of a swell new receipt for\nhome-made beer the other day. You take--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGunch interrupted, \xe2\x80\x9cWait! Let me tell you mine!\xe2\x80\x9d Littlefield snorted,\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeer! Rats! Thing to do is to ferment cider!\xe2\x80\x9d Jones insisted, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got\nthe receipt that does the business!\xe2\x80\x9d Swanson begged, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, say, lemme\ntell you the story--\xe2\x80\x9d But Frink went on resolutely, \xe2\x80\x9cYou take and save\nthe shells from peas, and pour six gallons of water on a bushel of\nshells and boil the mixture till--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMrs. Babbitt turned toward them with yearning sweetness; Frink hastened\nto finish even his best beer-recipe; and she said gaily, \xe2\x80\x9cDinner is\nserved.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere was a good deal of friendly argument among the men as to which\nshould go in last, and while they were crossing the hall from the\nliving-room to the dining-room Vergil Gunch made them laugh by\nthundering, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I can\xe2\x80\x99t sit next to Myra Babbitt and hold her hand under\nthe table, I won\xe2\x80\x99t play-- I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 home.\xe2\x80\x9d In the dining-room they stood\nembarrassed while Mrs. Babbitt fluttered, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, let me see-- Oh, I was\ngoing to have some nice hand-painted place-cards for you but-- Oh, let me\nsee; Mr. Frink, you sit there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe dinner was in the best style of women\xe2\x80\x99s-magazine art, whereby the\nsalad was served in hollowed apples, and everything but the invincible\nfried chicken resembled something else.\n\nOrdinarily the men found it hard to talk to the women; flirtation was an\nart unknown on Floral Heights, and the realms of offices and of kitchens\nhad no alliances. But under the inspiration of the cocktails,\nconversation was violent. Each of the men still had a number of\nimportant things to say about prohibition, and now that each had a loyal\nlistener in his dinner-partner he burst out:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI found a place where I can get all the hootch I want at eight a\nquart--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you read about this fellow that went and paid a thousand dollars\nfor ten cases of red-eye that proved to be nothing but water? Seems this\nfellow was standing on the corner and fellow comes up to him--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole raft of stuff being smuggled across at\nDetroit--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I always say is--what a lot of folks don\xe2\x80\x99t realize about\nprohibition--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then you get all this awful poison stuff--wood alcohol and\neverything--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourse I believe in it on principle, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t propose to have\nanybody telling me what I got to think and do. No American\xe2\x80\x99ll ever stand\nfor that!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut they all felt that it was rather in bad taste for Orville Jones--and\nhe not recognized as one of the wits of the occasion anyway--to say, \xe2\x80\x9cIn\nfact, the whole thing about prohibition is this: it isn\xe2\x80\x99t the initial\ncost, it\xe2\x80\x99s the humidity.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNot till the one required topic had been dealt with did the conversation\nbecome general.\n\nIt was often and admiringly said of Vergil Gunch, \xe2\x80\x9cGee, that fellow can\nget away with murder! Why, he can pull a Raw One in mixed company and\nall the ladies\xe2\x80\x99ll laugh their heads off, but me, gosh, if I crack\nanything that\xe2\x80\x99s just the least bit off color I get the razz for fair!\xe2\x80\x9d\nNow Gunch delighted them by crying to Mrs. Eddie Swanson, youngest of\nthe women, \xe2\x80\x9cLouetta! I managed to pinch Eddie\xe2\x80\x99s doorkey out of his\npocket, and what say you and me sneak across the street when the folks\naren\xe2\x80\x99t looking? Got something,\xe2\x80\x9d with a gorgeous leer, \xe2\x80\x9cawful important\nto tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe women wriggled, and Babbitt was stirred to like naughtiness. \xe2\x80\x9cSay,\nfolks, I wished I dared show you a book I borrowed from Doc Patten!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, George! The idea!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Babbitt warned him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis book--racy isn\xe2\x80\x99t the word! It\xe2\x80\x99s some kind of an anthropological\nreport about--about Customs, in the South Seas, and what it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\n_say_! It\xe2\x80\x99s a book you can\xe2\x80\x99t buy. Verg, I\xe2\x80\x99ll lend it to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe first!\xe2\x80\x9d insisted Eddie Swanson. \xe2\x80\x9cSounds spicy!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOrville Jones announced, \xe2\x80\x9cSay, I heard a Good One the other day about a\ncoupla Swedes and their wives,\xe2\x80\x9d and, in the best Jewish accent, he\nresolutely carried the Good One to a slightly disinfected ending. Gunch\ncapped it. But the cocktails waned, the seekers dropped back into\ncautious reality.\n\nChum Frink had recently been on a lecture-tour among the small towns,\nand he chuckled, \xe2\x80\x9cAwful good to get back to civilization! I certainly\nbeen seeing some hick towns! I mean-- Course the folks there are the best\non earth, but, gee whiz, those Main Street burgs are slow, and you\nfellows can\xe2\x80\x99t hardly appreciate what it means to be here with a bunch of\nlive ones!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet!\xe2\x80\x9d exulted Orville Jones. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re the best folks on earth,\nthose small-town folks, but, oh, mama! what conversation! Why, say, they\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t talk about anything but the weather and the ne-oo Ford, by\nheckalorum!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right. They all talk about just the same things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eddie\nSwanson.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t they, though! They just say the same things over and over,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nVergil Gunch.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s really remarkable. They seem to lack all power of looking at\nthings impersonally. They simply go over and over the same talk about\nFords and the weather and so on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Howard Littlefield.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, at that, you can\xe2\x80\x99t blame \xe2\x80\x99em. They haven\xe2\x80\x99t got any intellectual\nstimulus such as you get up here in the city,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chum Frink.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGosh, that\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Babbitt. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want you highbrows to get\nstuck on yourselves but I must say it keeps a fellow right up on his\ntoes to sit in with a poet and with Howard, the guy that put the con in\neconomics! But these small-town boobs, with nobody but each other to\ntalk to, no wonder they get so sloppy and uncultured in their speech,\nand so balled-up in their thinking!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOrville Jones commented, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, then take our other advantages--the\nmovies, frinstance. These Yapville sports think they\xe2\x80\x99re all-get-out if\nthey have one change of bill a week, where here in the city you got your\nchoice of a dozen diff\xe2\x80\x99rent movies any evening you want to name!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure, and the inspiration we get from rubbing up against high-class\nhustlers every day and getting jam full of ginger,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eddie Swanson.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSame time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Babbitt, \xe2\x80\x9cno sense excusing these rube burgs too easy.\nFellow\xe2\x80\x99s own fault if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t show the initiative to up and beat it\nto the city, like we done--did. And, just speaking in confidence among\nfriends, they\xe2\x80\x99re jealous as the devil of a city man. Every time I go up\nto Catawba I have to go around apologizing to the fellows I was brought\nup with because I\xe2\x80\x99ve more or less succeeded and they haven\xe2\x80\x99t. And if you\ntalk natural to \xe2\x80\x99em, way we do here, and show finesse and what you might\ncall a broad point of view, why, they think you\xe2\x80\x99re putting on side.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s my own half-brother Martin--runs the little ole general store my\nDad used to keep. Say, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet he don\xe2\x80\x99t know there is such a thing as a\nTux--as a dinner-jacket. If he was to come in here now, he\xe2\x80\x99d think we\nwere a bunch of--of-- Why, gosh, I swear, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to think!\nYes, sir, they\xe2\x80\x99re jealous!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nChum Frink agreed, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so. But what I mind is their lack of culture\nand appreciation of the Beautiful--if you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me for being\nhighbrow. Now, I like to give a high-class lecture, and read some of my\nbest poetry--not the newspaper stuff but the magazine things. But say,\nwhen I get out in the tall grass, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing will take but a lot of\ncheesy old stories and slang and junk that if any of us were to indulge\nin it here, he\xe2\x80\x99d get the gate so fast it would make his head swim.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVergil Gunch summed it up: \xe2\x80\x9cFact is, we\xe2\x80\x99re mighty lucky to be living\namong a bunch of city-folks, that recognize artistic things and\nbusiness-punch equally. We\xe2\x80\x99d feel pretty glum if we got stuck in some\nMain Street burg and tried to wise up the old codgers to the kind of\nlife we\xe2\x80\x99re used to here. But, by golly, there\xe2\x80\x99s this you got to say for\n\xe2\x80\x99em: Every small American town is trying to get population and modern\nideals. And darn if a lot of \xe2\x80\x99em don\xe2\x80\x99t put it across! Somebody starts\npanning a rube crossroads, telling how he was there in 1900 and it\nconsisted of one muddy street, count \xe2\x80\x99em, one, and nine hundred human\nclams. Well, you go back there in 1920, and you find pavements and a\nswell little hotel and a first-class ladies\xe2\x80\x99 ready-to-wear shop--real\nperfection, in fact! You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to just look at what these small\ntowns are, you want to look at what they\xe2\x80\x99re aiming to become, and they\nall got an ambition that in the long run is going to make \xe2\x80\x99em the finest\nspots on earth--they all want to be just like Zenith!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nIII\n\nHowever intimate they might be with T. Cholmondeley Frink as a neighbor,\nas a borrower of lawn-mowers and monkey-wrenches, they knew that he was\nalso a Famous Poet and a distinguished advertising-agent; that behind\nhis easiness were sultry literary mysteries which they could not\npenetrate. But to-night, in the gin-evolved confidence, he admitted them\nto the arcanum:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a literary problem that\xe2\x80\x99s worrying me to death. I\xe2\x80\x99m doing a\nseries of ads for the Zeeco Car and I want to make each of \xe2\x80\x99em a real\nlittle gem--reg\xe2\x80\x99lar stylistic stuff. I\xe2\x80\x99m all for this theory that\nperfection is the stunt, or nothing at all, and these are as tough\nthings as I ever tackled. You might think it\xe2\x80\x99d be harder to do my\npoems--all these Heart Topics: home and fireside and happiness--but\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re cinches. You can\xe2\x80\x99t go wrong on \xe2\x80\x99em; you know what sentiments any\ndecent go-ahead fellow must have if he plays the game, and you stick\nright to \xe2\x80\x99em. But the poetry of industrialism, now there\xe2\x80\x99s a literary\nline where you got to open up new territory. Do you know the fellow\nwho\xe2\x80\x99s really _the_ American genius? The fellow who you don\xe2\x80\x99t know his\nname and I don\xe2\x80\x99t either, but his work ought to be preserved so\xe2\x80\x99s future\ngenerations can judge our American thought and originality to-day? Why,\nthe fellow that writes the Prince Albert Tobacco ads! Just listen to\nthis:\n\n     It\xe2\x80\x99s P.A. that jams such joy in jimmy pipes. Say--bet you\xe2\x80\x99ve often\n     bent-an-ear to that spill-of-speech about hopping from five to\n     f-i-f-t-y p-e-r by \xe2\x80\x9cstepping on her a bit!\xe2\x80\x9d Guess that\xe2\x80\x99s going\n     some, all right--BUT--just among ourselves, you better start a\n     rapidwhiz system to keep tabs as to how fast you\xe2\x80\x99ll buzz from low\n     smoke spirits to _tip-top-high_--once you line up behind a jimmy\n     pipe that\xe2\x80\x99s all aglow with that peach-of-a-pal, Prince Albert.\n\n     Prince Albert is john-on-the-job--always joy\xe2\x80\x99usly more-_ish_ in\n     flavor; always delightfully cool and fragrant! For a fact, you\n     never hooked such double-decked, copper-riveted, two-fisted smoke\n     enjoyment!\n\n     Go to a pipe--speed-o-quick like you light on a good thing!\n     Why--packed with Prince Albert you can play a joy\xe2\x80\x99us jimmy straight\n     across the boards! _And you know what that means!_\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow that,\xe2\x80\x9d caroled the motor agent, Eddie Swanson, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s what I call\nhe-literature! That Prince Albert fellow--though, gosh, there can\xe2\x80\x99t be\njust one fellow that writes \xe2\x80\x99em; must be a big board of classy\nink-slingers in conference, but anyway: now, him, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t write for\nlong-haired pikers, he writes for Regular Guys, he writes for _me_, and\nI tip my benny to him! The only thing is: I wonder if it sells the\ngoods? Course, like all these poets, this Prince Albert fellow lets his\nidea run away with him. It makes elegant reading, but it don\xe2\x80\x99t say\nnothing. I\xe2\x80\x99d never go out and buy Prince Albert Tobacco after reading\nit, because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me anything about the stuff. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a\nbunch of fluff.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFrink faced him: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99re crazy! Have I got to sell you the idea of\nStyle? Anyway, that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of stuff I\xe2\x80\x99d like to do for the Zeeco.\nBut I simply can\xe2\x80\x99t. So I decided to stick to the straight poetic, and I\ntook a shot at a highbrow ad for the Zeeco. How do you like this:\n\n     The long white trail is calling--calling--and it\xe2\x80\x99s over the hills\n     and far away for every man or woman that has red blood in his veins\n     and on his lips the ancient song of the buccaneers. It\xe2\x80\x99s away with\n     dull drudging, and a fig for care. Speed--glorious Speed--it\xe2\x80\x99s more\n     than just a moment\xe2\x80\x99s exhilaration--it\xe2\x80\x99s Life for you and me! This\n     great new truth the makers of the Zeeco Car have considered as much\n     as price and style. It\xe2\x80\x99s fleet as the antelope, smooth as the glide\n     of a swallow, yet powerful as the charge of a bull-elephant. Class\n     breathes in every line. Listen, brother! You\xe2\x80\x99ll never know what the\n     high art of hiking is till you TRY LIFE\xe2\x80\x99S ZIPPINGEST ZEST--THE\n     ZEECO!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Frink mused, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s got an elegant color to it, if I do say so,\nbut it ain\xe2\x80\x99t got the originality of \xe2\x80\x98spill-of-speech!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe whole company sighed with sympathy and admiration.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nI\n\nBabbitt was fond of his friends, he loved the importance of being host\nand shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have smore chicken--the idea!\xe2\x80\x9d\nand he appreciated the genius of T. Cholmondeley Frink, but the vigor of\nthe cocktails was gone, and the more he ate the less joyful he felt.\nThen the amity of the dinner was destroyed by the nagging of the\nSwansons.\n\nIn Floral Heights and the other prosperous sections of Zenith,\nespecially in the \xe2\x80\x9cyoung married set,\xe2\x80\x9d there were many women who had\nnothing to do. Though they had few servants, yet with gas stoves,\nelectric ranges and dish-washers and vacuum cleaners, and tiled kitchen\nwalls, their houses were so convenient that they had little housework,\nand much of their food came from bakeries and delicatessens. They had\nbut two, one, or no children; and despite the myth that the Great War\nhad made work respectable, their husbands objected to their \xe2\x80\x9cwasting\ntime and getting a lot of crank ideas\xe2\x80\x9d in unpaid social work, and still\nmore to their causing a rumor, by earning money, that they were not\nadequately supported. They worked perhaps two hours a day, and the rest\nof the time they ate chocolates, went to the motion-pictures, went\nwindow-shopping, went in gossiping twos and threes to card-parties, read\nmagazines, thought timorously of the lovers who never appeared, and\naccumulated a splendid restlessness which they got rid of by nagging\ntheir husbands. The husbands nagged back.\n\nOf these naggers the Swansons were perfect specimens.\n\nThroughout the dinner Eddie Swanson had been complaining, publicly,\nabout his wife\xe2\x80\x99s new frock. It was, he submitted, too short, too low,\ntoo immodestly thin, and much too expensive. He appealed to Babbitt:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonest, George, what do you think of that rag Louetta went and bought?\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think it\xe2\x80\x99s the limit?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s eating you, Eddie? I call it a swell little dress.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is, Mr. Swanson. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sweet frock,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Babbitt protested.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now, do you see, smarty! You\xe2\x80\x99re such an authority on clothes!\xe2\x80\x9d\nLouetta raged, while the guests ruminated and peeped at her shoulders.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Swanson. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m authority enough so I know it\nwas a waste of money, and it makes me tired to see you not wearing out a\nwhole closetful of clothes you got already. I\xe2\x80\x99ve expressed my idea about\nthis before, and you know good and well you didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay the least bit of\nattention. I have to camp on your trail to get you to do anything--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere was much more of it, and they all assisted, all but Babbitt.\nEverything about him was dim except his stomach, and that was a bright\nscarlet disturbance. \xe2\x80\x9cHad too much grub; oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to eat this stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d he\ngroaned--while he went on eating, while he gulped down a chill and\nglutinous slice of the ice-cream brick, and cocoanut cake as oozy as\nshaving-cream. He felt as though he had been stuffed with clay; his body\nwas bursting, his throat was bursting, his brain was hot mud; and only\nwith agony did he continue to smile and shout as became a host on Floral\nHeights.\n\nHe would, except for his guests, have fled outdoors and walked off the\nintoxication of food, but in the haze which filled the room they sat\nforever, talking, talking, while he agonized, \xe2\x80\x9cDarn fool to be eating\nall this--not \xe2\x80\x99nother mouthful,\xe2\x80\x9d and discovered that he was again\ntasting the sickly welter of melted ice cream on his plate. There was no\nmagic in his friends; he was not uplifted when Howard Littlefield\nproduced from his treasure-house of scholarship the information that\nthe chemical symbol for raw rubber is C\xe2\x82\x81\xe2\x82\x80H\xe2\x82\x81\xe2\x82\x86, which turns into\nisoprene, or 2C\xe2\x82\x85H\xe2\x82\x88. Suddenly, without precedent, Babbitt was not merely\nbored but admitting that he was bored. It was ecstasy to escape from the\ntable, from the torture of a straight chair, and loll on the davenport\nin the living-room.\n\nThe others, from their fitful unconvincing talk, their expressions of\nbeing slowly and painfully smothered, seemed to be suffering from the\ntoil of social life and the horror of good food as much as himself. All\nof them accepted with relief the suggestion of bridge.\n\nBabbitt recovered from the feeling of being boiled. He won at bridge. He\nwas again able to endure Vergil Gunch\xe2\x80\x99s inexorable heartiness. But he\npictured loafing with Paul Riesling beside a lake in Maine. It was as\noverpowering and imaginative as homesickness. He had never seen Maine,\nyet he beheld the shrouded mountains, the tranquil lake of evening.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat boy Paul\xe2\x80\x99s worth all these ballyhooing highbrows put together,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nmuttered; and, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to get away from--everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEven Louetta Swanson did not rouse him.\n\nMrs. Swanson was pretty and pliant. Babbitt was not an analyst of women,\nexcept as to their tastes in Furnished Houses to Rent. He divided them\ninto Real Ladies, Working Women, Old Cranks, and Fly Chickens. He mooned\nover their charms but he was of opinion that all of them (save the women\nof his own family) were \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmysterious.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet he had known\nby instinct that Louetta Swanson could be approached. Her eyes and lips\nwere moist. Her face tapered from a broad forehead to a pointed chin,\nher mouth was thin but strong and avid, and between her brows were two\noutcurving and passionate wrinkles. She was thirty, perhaps, or younger.\nGossip had never touched her, but every man naturally and instantly rose\nto flirtatiousness when he spoke to her, and every woman watched her\nwith stilled blankness.\n\nBetween games, sitting on the davenport, Babbitt spoke to her with the\nrequisite gallantry, that sonorous Floral Heights gallantry which is\nnot flirtation but a terrified flight from it:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re looking like a new soda-fountain to-night, Louetta.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOle Eddie kind of on the rampage.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I get so sick of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, when you get tired of hubby, you can run off with Uncle George.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I ran away-- Oh, well--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnybody ever tell you your hands are awful pretty?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe looked down at them, she pulled the lace of her sleeves over them,\nbut otherwise she did not heed him. She was lost in unexpressed\nimaginings.\n\nBabbitt was too languid this evening to pursue his duty of being a\ncaptivating (though strictly moral) male. He ambled back to the\nbridge-tables. He was not much thrilled when Mrs. Frink, a small\ntwittering woman, proposed that they \xe2\x80\x9ctry and do some spiritualism and\ntable-tipping--you know Chum can make the spirits come--honest, he just\nscares me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe ladies of the party had not emerged all evening, but now, as the sex\ngiven to things of the spirit while the men warred against base things\nmaterial, they took command and cried, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, let\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x9d In the dimness the\nmen were rather solemn and foolish, but the goodwives quivered and\nadored as they sat about the table. They laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, you be good or\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell!\xe2\x80\x9d when the men took their hands in the circle.\n\nBabbitt tingled with a slight return of interest in life as Louetta\nSwanson\xe2\x80\x99s hand closed on his with quiet firmness.\n\nAll of them hunched over, intent. They startled as some one drew a\nstrained breath. In the dusty light from the hall they looked unreal,\nthey felt disembodied. Mrs. Gunch squeaked, and they jumped with\nunnatural jocularity, but at Frink\xe2\x80\x99s hiss they sank into subdued awe.\nSuddenly, incredibly, they heard a knocking. They stared at Frink\xe2\x80\x99s\nhalf-revealed hands and found them lying still. They wriggled, and\npretended not to be impressed.\n\nFrink spoke with gravity: \xe2\x80\x9cIs some one there?\xe2\x80\x9d A thud. \xe2\x80\x9cIs one knock to\nbe the sign for \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d A thud. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd two for \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d A thud.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, ladies and gentlemen, shall we ask the guide to put us into\ncommunication with the spirit of some great one passed over?\xe2\x80\x9d Frink\nmumbled.\n\nMrs. Orville Jones begged, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk to Dante! We studied him at\nthe Reading Circle. You know who he was, Orvy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I know who he was! The Wop poet. Where do you think I was\nraised?\xe2\x80\x9d from her insulted husband.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure--the fellow that took the Cook\xe2\x80\x99s Tour to Hell. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never waded\nthrough his po\xe2\x80\x99try, but we learned about him in the U.,\xe2\x80\x9d said Babbitt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPage Mr. Dannnnnty!\xe2\x80\x9d intoned Eddie Swanson.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to get him easy, Mr. Frink, you and he being fellow-poets,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Louetta Swanson.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFellow-poets, rats! Where d\xe2\x80\x99 you get that stuff?\xe2\x80\x9d protested Vergil\nGunch. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose Dante showed a lot of speed for an old-timer--not that\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve actually read him, of course--but to come right down to hard facts,\nhe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand one-two-three if he had to buckle down to practical\nliterature and turn out a poem for the newspaper-syndicate every day,\nlike Chum does!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so,\xe2\x80\x9d from Eddie Swanson. \xe2\x80\x9cThose old birds could take their time.\nJudas Priest, I could write poetry myself if I had a whole year for it,\nand just wrote about that old-fashioned junk like Dante wrote about.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFrink demanded, \xe2\x80\x9cHush, now! I\xe2\x80\x99ll call him.... O, Laughing Eyes, emerge\nforth into the, uh, the ultimates and bring hither the spirit of Dante,\nthat we mortals may list to his words of wisdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou forgot to give um the address: 1658 Brimstone Avenue, Fiery\nHeights, Hell,\xe2\x80\x9d Gunch chuckled, but the others felt that this was\nirreligious. And besides--\xe2\x80\x9cprobably it was just Chum making the knocks,\nbut still, if there did happen to be something to all this, be exciting\nto talk to an old fellow belonging to--way back in early times--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA thud. The spirit of Dante had come to the parlor of George F. Babbitt.\n\nHe was, it seemed, quite ready to answer their questions. He was \xe2\x80\x9cglad\nto be with them, this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFrink spelled out the messages by running through the alphabet till the\nspirit interpreter knocked at the right letter.\n\nLittlefield asked, in a learned tone, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you like it in the Paradiso,\nMessire?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are very happy on the higher plane, Signor. We are glad that you are\nstudying this great truth of spiritualism,\xe2\x80\x9d Dante replied.\n\nThe circle moved with an awed creaking of stays and shirtfronts.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose--suppose there were something to this?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt had a different worry. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose Chum Frink was really one of\nthese spiritualists! Chum had, for a literary fellow, always seemed to\nbe a Regular Guy; he belonged to the Chatham Road Presbyterian Church\nand went to the Boosters\xe2\x80\x99 lunches and liked cigars and motors and racy\nstories. But suppose that secretly-- After all, you never could tell\nabout these darn highbrows; and to be an out-and-out spiritualist would\nbe almost like being a socialist!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNo one could long be serious in the presence of Vergil Gunch. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk Dant\xe2\x80\x99\nhow Jack Shakespeare and old Verg\xe2\x80\x99--the guy they named after me--are\ngettin\xe2\x80\x99 along, and don\xe2\x80\x99t they wish they could get into the movie game!\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe blared, and instantly all was mirth. Mrs. Jones shrieked, and Eddie\nSwanson desired to know whether Dante didn\xe2\x80\x99t catch cold with nothing on\nbut his wreath.\n\nThe pleased Dante made humble answer.\n\nBut Babbitt--the curst discontent was torturing him again, and heavily,\nin the impersonal darkness, he pondered, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t-- We\xe2\x80\x99re all so flip\nand think we\xe2\x80\x99re so smart. There\xe2\x80\x99d be-- A fellow like Dante-- I wish I\xe2\x80\x99d\nread some of his pieces. I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I ever will, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe had, without explanation, the impression of a slaggy cliff and on it,\nin silhouette against menacing clouds, a lone and austere figure. He was\ndismayed by a sudden contempt for his surest friends. He grasped Louetta\nSwanson\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and found the comfort of human warmth. Habit came, a\nveteran warrior; and he shook himself. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the deuce is the matter\nwith me, this evening?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe patted Louetta\xe2\x80\x99s hand, to indicate that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t meant anything\nimproper by squeezing it, and demanded of Frink, \xe2\x80\x9cSay, see if you can\nget old Dant\xe2\x80\x99 to spiel us some of his poetry. Talk up to him. Tell him,\n\xe2\x80\x98_Buena giorna, se\xc3\xb1or, com sa va, wie geht\xe2\x80\x99s? Keskersaykersa_ a little\npome, _se\xc3\xb1or_?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nII\n\nThe lights were switched on; the women sat on the fronts of their chairs\nin that determined suspense whereby a wife indicates that as soon as the\npresent speaker has finished, she is going to remark brightly to her\nhusband, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, dear, I think per-_haps_ it\xe2\x80\x99s about time for us to be\nsaying good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d For once Babbitt did not break out in blustering\nefforts to keep the party going. He had--there was something he wished\nto think out-- But the psychical research had started them off again.\n(\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t they go home! Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t they go home!\xe2\x80\x9d) Though he was\nimpressed by the profundity of the statement, he was only\nhalf-enthusiastic when Howard Littlefield lectured, \xe2\x80\x9cThe United States\nis the only nation in which the government is a Moral Ideal and not just\na social arrangement.\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cTrue--true--weren\xe2\x80\x99t they _ever_ going home?\xe2\x80\x9d)\nHe was usually delighted to have an \xe2\x80\x9cinside view\xe2\x80\x9d of the momentous world\nof motors but to-night he scarcely listened to Eddie Swanson\xe2\x80\x99s\nrevelation: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to go above the Javelin class, the Zeeco is a\nmighty good buy. Couple weeks ago, and mind you, this was a fair,\nsquare test, they took a Zeeco stock touring-car and they slid up the\nTonawanda hill on high, and fellow told me--\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cZeeco--good boat\nbut-- Were they planning to stay all night?\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\nThey really were going, with a flutter of \xe2\x80\x9cWe did have the best time!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMost aggressively friendly of all was Babbitt, yet as he burbled he was\nreflecting, \xe2\x80\x9cI got through it, but for a while there I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly\nthink I\xe2\x80\x99d last out.\xe2\x80\x9d He prepared to taste that most delicate pleasure of\nthe host: making fun of his guests in the relaxation of midnight. As the\ndoor closed he yawned voluptuously, chest out, shoulders wriggling, and\nturned cynically to his wife.\n\nShe was beaming. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it was nice, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it! I know they enjoyed every\nminute of it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t mock. It would have been like sneering at\na happy child. He lied ponderously: \xe2\x80\x9cYou bet! Best party this year, by a\nlong shot.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t the dinner good! And honestly I thought the fried chicken was\ndelicious!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet! Fried to the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s taste. Best fried chicken I\xe2\x80\x99ve tasted for\na coon\xe2\x80\x99s age.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t Matilda fry it beautifully! And don\xe2\x80\x99t you think the soup was\nsimply delicious?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt certainly was! It was corking! Best soup I\xe2\x80\x99ve tasted since Heck was\na pup!\xe2\x80\x9d But his voice was seeping away. They stood in the hall, under\nthe electric light in its square box-like shade of red glass bound with\nnickel. She stared at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, George, you don\xe2\x80\x99t sound--you sound as if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t really enjoyed\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure I did! Course I did!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge! What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of tired, I guess. Been pounding pretty hard at the\noffice. Need to get away and rest up a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to Maine in just a few weeks now, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYuh--\xe2\x80\x9d Then he was pouring it out nakedly, robbed of reticence. \xe2\x80\x9cMyra:\nI think it\xe2\x80\x99d be a good thing for me to get up there early.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have this man you have to meet in New York about business.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat man? Oh, sure. Him. Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s all off. But I want to hit Maine\nearly--get in a little fishing, catch me a big trout, by golly!\xe2\x80\x9d A\nnervous, artificial laugh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we do it? Verona and Matilda can run the house between\nthem, and you and I can go any time, if you think we can afford it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s-- I\xe2\x80\x99ve been feeling so jumpy lately, I thought maybe it might\nbe a good thing if I kind of got off by myself and sweat it out of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you _want_ me to go along?\xe2\x80\x9d She was too wretchedly in\nearnest to be tragic, or gloriously insulted, or anything save dumpy and\ndefenseless and flushed to the red steaminess of a boiled beet.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do! I just meant--\xe2\x80\x9d Remembering that Paul Riesling had\npredicted this, he was as desperate as she. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean, sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s a\ngood thing for an old grouch like me to go off and get it out of his\nsystem.\xe2\x80\x9d He tried to sound paternal. \xe2\x80\x9cThen when you and the kids\narrive-- I figured maybe I might skip up to Maine just a few days ahead\nof you-- I\xe2\x80\x99d be ready for a real bat, see how I mean?\xe2\x80\x9d He coaxed her with\nlarge booming sounds, with affable smiles, like a popular preacher\nblessing an Easter congregation, like a humorous lecturer completing his\nstint of eloquence, like all perpetrators of masculine wiles.\n\nShe stared at him, the joy of festival drained from her face. \xe2\x80\x9cDo I\nbother you when we go on vacations? Don\xe2\x80\x99t I add anything to your fun?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe broke. Suddenly, dreadfully, he was hysterical, he was a yelping\nbaby. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, yes! Hell, yes! But can\xe2\x80\x99t you understand I\xe2\x80\x99m shot to\npieces? I\xe2\x80\x99m all in! I got to take care of myself! I tell you, I got\nto-- I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of everything and everybody! I got to--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was she who was mature and protective now. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course! You shall\nrun off by yourself! Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you get Paul to go along, and you boys\njust fish and have a good time?\xe2\x80\x9d She patted his shoulder--reaching up to\nit--while he shook with palsied helplessness, and in that moment was not\nmerely by habit fond of her but clung to her strength.\n\nShe cried cheerily, \xe2\x80\x9cNow up-stairs you go, and pop into bed. We\xe2\x80\x99ll fix\nit all up. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see to the doors. Now skip!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFor many minutes, for many hours, for a bleak eternity, he lay awake,\nshivering, reduced to primitive terror, comprehending that he had won\nfreedom, and wondering what he could do with anything so unknown and so\nembarrassing as freedom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nI\n\nNo apartment-house in Zenith had more resolutely experimented in\ncondensation than the Revelstoke Arms, in which Paul and Zilla Riesling\nhad a flat. By sliding the beds into low closets the bedrooms were\nconverted into living-rooms. The kitchens were cupboards each containing\nan electric range, a copper sink, a glass refrigerator, and, very\nintermittently, a Balkan maid. Everything about the Arms was excessively\nmodern, and everything was compressed--except the garages.\n\nThe Babbitts were calling on the Rieslings at the Arms. It was a\nspeculative venture to call on the Rieslings; interesting and sometimes\ndisconcerting. Zilla was an active, strident, full-blown, high-bosomed\nblonde. When she condescended to be good-humored she was nervously\namusing. Her comments on people were saltily satiric and penetrative of\naccepted hypocrisies. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so!\xe2\x80\x9d you said, and looked sheepish. She\ndanced wildly, and called on the world to be merry, but in the midst of\nit she would turn indignant. She was always becoming indignant. Life was\na plot against her, and she exposed it furiously.\n\nShe was affable to-night. She merely hinted that Orville Jones wore a\ntoup\xc3\xa9, that Mrs. T. Cholmondeley Frink\xe2\x80\x99s singing resembled a Ford going\ninto high, and that the Hon. Otis Deeble, mayor of Zenith and candidate\nfor Congress, was a flatulent fool (which was quite true). The Babbitts\nand Rieslings sat doubtfully on stone-hard brocade chairs in the small\nliving-room of the flat, with its mantel unprovided with a fireplace,\nand its strip of heavy gilt fabric upon a glaring new player-piano, till\nMrs. Riesling shrieked, \xe2\x80\x9cCome on! Let\xe2\x80\x99s put some pep in it! Get out\nyour fiddle, Paul, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to make Georgie dance decently.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Babbitts were in earnest. They were plotting for the escape to\nMaine. But when Mrs. Babbitt hinted with plump smilingness, \xe2\x80\x9cDoes Paul\nget as tired after the winter\xe2\x80\x99s work as Georgie does?\xe2\x80\x9d then Zilla\nremembered an injury; and when Zilla Riesling remembered an injury the\nworld stopped till something had been done about it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he get tired? No, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get tired, he just goes crazy, that\xe2\x80\x99s\nall! You think Paul is so reasonable, oh, yes, and he loves to make out\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s a little lamb, but he\xe2\x80\x99s stubborn as a mule. Oh, if you had to live\nwith him--! You\xe2\x80\x99d find out how sweet he is! He just pretends to be meek\nso he can have his own way. And me, I get the credit for being a\nterrible old crank, but if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t blow up once in a while and get\nsomething started, we\xe2\x80\x99d die of dry-rot. He never wants to go any place\nand-- Why, last evening, just because the car was out of order--and that\nwas his fault, too, because he ought to have taken it to the\nservice-station and had the battery looked at--and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go\ndown to the movies on the trolley. But we went, and then there was one\nof those impudent conductors, and Paul wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do a thing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was standing on the platform waiting for the people to let me into\nthe car, and this beast, this conductor, hollered at me, \xe2\x80\x98Come on, you,\nmove up!\xe2\x80\x99 Why, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had anybody speak to me that way in all my\nlife! I was so astonished I just turned to him and said-- I thought there\nmust be some mistake, and so I said to him, perfectly pleasant, \xe2\x80\x98Were\nyou speaking to me?\xe2\x80\x99 and he went on and bellowed at me, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, I was!\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re keeping the whole car from starting!\xe2\x80\x99 he said, and then I saw he\nwas one of these dirty ill-bred hogs that kindness is wasted on, and so\nI stopped and looked right at him, and I said, \xe2\x80\x98I--beg--your--pardon, I\nam not doing anything of the kind,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s the people ahead of\nme, who won\xe2\x80\x99t move up,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98and furthermore, let me tell you,\nyoung man, that you\xe2\x80\x99re a low-down, foul-mouthed, impertinent skunk,\xe2\x80\x99 I\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98and you\xe2\x80\x99re no gentleman! I certainly intend to report you, and\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll see,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98whether a lady is to be insulted by any drunken bum\nthat chooses to put on a ragged uniform, and I\xe2\x80\x99d thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98to\nkeep your filthy abuse to yourself.\xe2\x80\x99 And then I waited for Paul to show\nhe was half a man and come to my defense, and he just stood there and\npretended he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard a word, and so I said to him, \xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 I\nsaid--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, cut it, cut it, Zill!\xe2\x80\x9d Paul groaned. \xe2\x80\x9cWe all know I\xe2\x80\x99m a\nmollycoddle, and you\xe2\x80\x99re a tender bud, and let\xe2\x80\x99s let it go at that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it go?\xe2\x80\x9d Zilla\xe2\x80\x99s face was wrinkled like the Medusa, her voice was a\ndagger of corroded brass. She was full of the joy of righteousness and\nbad temper. She was a crusader and, like every crusader, she exulted in\nthe opportunity to be vicious in the name of virtue. \xe2\x80\x9cLet it go? If\npeople knew how many things I\xe2\x80\x99ve let go--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, quit being such a bully.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a fine figure you\xe2\x80\x99d cut if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t bully you! You\xe2\x80\x99d lie abed till\nnoon and play your idiotic fiddle till midnight! You\xe2\x80\x99re born lazy, and\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re born shiftless, and you\xe2\x80\x99re born cowardly, Paul Riesling--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, now, don\xe2\x80\x99t say that, Zilla; you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean a word of it!\xe2\x80\x9d protested\nMrs. Babbitt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will say that, and I mean every single last word of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, now, Zilla, the idea!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Babbitt was maternal and fussy. She was\nno older than Zilla, but she seemed so--at first. She was placid and\npuffy and mature, where Zilla, at forty-five, was so bleached and\ntight-corseted that you knew only that she was older than she looked.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe idea of talking to poor Paul like that!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Paul is right! We\xe2\x80\x99d both be poor, we\xe2\x80\x99d be in the poorhouse, if I\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t jazz him up!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, now, Zilla, Georgie and I were just saying how hard Paul\xe2\x80\x99s been\nworking all year, and we were thinking it would be lovely if the Boys\ncould run off by themselves. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been coaxing George to go up to Maine\nahead of the rest of us, and get the tired out of his system before we\ncome, and I think it would be lovely if Paul could manage to get away\nand join him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt this exposure of his plot to escape, Paul was startled out of\nimpassivity. He rubbed his fingers. His hands twitched.\n\nZilla bayed, \xe2\x80\x9cYes! You\xe2\x80\x99re lucky! You can let George go, and not have to\nwatch him. Fat old Georgie! Never peeps at another woman! Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got the\nspunk!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hell I haven\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt was fervently defending his priceless\nimmorality when Paul interrupted him--and Paul looked dangerous. He rose\nquickly; he said gently to Zilla:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you imply I have a lot of sweethearts.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, my dear, since you ask for it-- There hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a time in\nthe last ten years when I haven\xe2\x80\x99t found some nice little girl to comfort\nme, and as long as you continue your amiability I shall probably\ncontinue to deceive you. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t hard. You\xe2\x80\x99re so stupid.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nZilla gibbered; she howled; words could not be distinguished in her\nslaver of abuse.\n\nThen the bland George F. Babbitt was transformed. If Paul was dangerous,\nif Zilla was a snake-locked fury, if the neat emotions suitable to the\nRevelstoke Arms had been slashed into raw hatreds, it was Babbitt who\nwas the most formidable. He leaped up. He seemed very large. He seized\nZilla\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. The cautions of the broker were wiped from his face,\nand his voice was cruel:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough of all this damn nonsense! I\xe2\x80\x99ve known you for\ntwenty-five years, Zil, and I never knew you to miss a chance to take\nyour disappointments out on Paul. You\xe2\x80\x99re not wicked. You\xe2\x80\x99re worse.\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re a fool. And let me tell you that Paul is the finest boy God ever\nmade. Every decent person is sick and tired of your taking advantage of\nbeing a woman and springing every mean innuendo you can think of. Who\nthe hell are you that a person like Paul should have to ask your\n_permission_ to go with me? You act like you were a combination of Queen\nVictoria and Cleopatra. You fool, can\xe2\x80\x99t you see how people snicker at\nyou, and sneer at you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nZilla was sobbing, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never-- I\xe2\x80\x99ve never--nobody ever talked to me\nlike this in all my life!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the way they talk behind your back! Always! They say\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re a scolding old woman. Old, by God!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThat cowardly attack broke her. Her eyes were blank. She wept. But\nBabbitt glared stolidly. He felt that he was the all-powerful official\nin charge; that Paul and Mrs. Babbitt looked on him with awe; that he\nalone could handle this case.\n\nZilla writhed. She begged, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, they don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey certainly do!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a bad woman! I\xe2\x80\x99m terribly sorry! I\xe2\x80\x99ll kill myself! I\xe2\x80\x99ll do\nanything. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll-- What do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe abased herself completely. Also, she enjoyed it. To the connoisseur\nof scenes, nothing is more enjoyable than a thorough, melodramatic,\negoistic humility.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you to let Paul beat it off to Maine with me,\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt demanded.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I help his going? You\xe2\x80\x99ve just said I was an idiot and nobody\npaid any attention to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you can help it, all right, all right! What you got to do is to cut\nout hinting that the minute he gets out of your sight, he\xe2\x80\x99ll go chasing\nafter some petticoat. Matter fact, that\xe2\x80\x99s the way you start the boy off\nwrong. You ought to have more sense--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I will, honestly, I will, George. I know I was bad. Oh, forgive me,\nall of you, forgive me--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe enjoyed it.\n\nSo did Babbitt. He condemned magnificently and forgave piously, and as\nhe went parading out with his wife he was grandly explanatory to her:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKind of a shame to bully Zilla, but course it was the only way to\nhandle her. Gosh, I certainly did have her crawling!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe said calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cYes. You were horrid. You were showing off. You were\nhaving a lovely time thinking what a great fine person you were!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, by golly! Can you beat it! Of course I might of expected you to\nnot stand by me! I might of expected you\xe2\x80\x99d stick up for your own sex!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Poor Zilla, she\xe2\x80\x99s so unhappy. She takes it out on Paul. She hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\na single thing to do, in that little flat. And she broods too much. And\nshe used to be so pretty and gay, and she resents losing it. And you\nwere just as nasty and mean as you could be. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a bit proud of\nyou--or of Paul, boasting about his horrid love-affairs!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe was sulkily silent; he maintained his bad temper at a high level of\noutraged nobility all the four blocks home. At the door he left her, in\nself-approving haughtiness, and tramped the lawn.\n\nWith a shock it was revealed to him: \xe2\x80\x9cGosh, I wonder if she was\nright--if she was partly right?\xe2\x80\x9d Overwork must have flayed him to\nabnormal sensitiveness; it was one of the few times in his life when he\nhad queried his eternal excellence; and he perceived the summer night,\nsmelled the wet grass. Then: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care! I\xe2\x80\x99ve pulled it off. We\xe2\x80\x99re\ngoing to have our spree. And for Paul, I\xe2\x80\x99d do anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nII\n\nThey were buying their Maine tackle at Ijams Brothers\xe2\x80\x99, the Sporting\nGoods Mart, with the help of Willis Ijams, fellow member of the\nBoosters\xe2\x80\x99 Club. Babbitt was completely mad. He trumpeted and danced. He\nmuttered to Paul, \xe2\x80\x9cSay, this is pretty good, eh? To be buying the stuff,\neh? And good old Willis Ijams himself coming down on the floor to wait\non us! Say, if those fellows that are getting their kit for the North\nLakes knew we were going clear up to Maine, they\xe2\x80\x99d have a fit, eh?...\nWell, come on, Brother Ijams--Willis, I mean. Here\xe2\x80\x99s your chance! We\xe2\x80\x99re\na couple of easy marks! Whee! Let me at it! I\xe2\x80\x99m going to buy out the\nstore!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe gloated on fly-rods and gorgeous rubber hip-boots, on tents with\ncelluloid windows and folding chairs and ice-boxes. He simple-heartedly\nwanted to buy all of them. It was the Paul whom he was always vaguely\nprotecting who kept him from his drunken desires.\n\nBut even Paul lightened when Willis Ijams, a salesman with poetry and\ndiplomacy, discussed flies. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, of course, you boys know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe great scrap is between dry flies and wet flies. Personally, I\xe2\x80\x99m for\ndry flies. More sporting.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so. Lots more sporting,\xe2\x80\x9d fulminated Babbitt, who knew very\nlittle about flies either wet or dry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow if you\xe2\x80\x99ll take my advice, Georgie, you\xe2\x80\x99ll stock up well on these\npale evening dims, and silver sedges, and red ants. Oh, boy, there\xe2\x80\x99s a\nfly, that red ant!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet! That\xe2\x80\x99s what it is--a fly!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoiced Babbitt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, that red ant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ijams, \xe2\x80\x9cis a real honest-to-God _fly_!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I guess ole Mr. Trout won\xe2\x80\x99t come a-hustling when I drop one of\nthose red ants on the water!\xe2\x80\x9d asserted Babbitt, and his thick wrists\nmade a rapturous motion of casting.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and the landlocked salmon will take it, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ijams, who had\nnever seen a landlocked salmon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSalmon! Trout! Say, Paul, can you see Uncle George with his khaki pants\non haulin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em in, some morning \xe2\x80\x99bout seven? Whee!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nIII\n\nThey were on the New York express, incredibly bound for Maine,\nincredibly without their families. They were free, in a man\xe2\x80\x99s world, in\nthe smoking-compartment of the Pullman.\n\nOutside the car window was a glaze of darkness stippled with the gold of\ninfrequent mysterious lights. Babbitt was immensely conscious, in the\nsway and authoritative clatter of the train, of going, of going on.\nLeaning toward Paul he grunted, \xe2\x80\x9cGosh, pretty nice to be hiking, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe small room, with its walls of ocher-colored steel, was filled mostly\nwith the sort of men he classified as the Best Fellows You\xe2\x80\x99ll Ever\nMeet--Real Good Mixers. There were four of them on the long seat; a fat\nman with a shrewd fat face, a knife-edged man in a green velour hat, a\nvery young young man with an imitation amber cigarette-holder, and\nBabbitt. Facing them, on two movable leather chairs, were Paul and a\nlanky, old-fashioned man, very cunning, with wrinkles bracketing his\nmouth. They all read newspapers or trade journals, boot-and-shoe\njournals, crockery journals, and waited for the joys of conversation. It\nwas the very young man, now making his first journey by Pullman, who\nbegan it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, gee, I had a wild old time in Zenith!\xe2\x80\x9d he gloried. \xe2\x80\x9cSay, if a\nfellow knows the ropes there he can have as wild a time as he can in New\nYork!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYuh, I bet you simply raised the old Ned. I figured you were a bad man\nwhen I saw you get on the train!\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled the fat one.\n\nThe others delightedly laid down their papers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right now! I guess I seen some things in the Arbor you\nnever seen!\xe2\x80\x9d complained the boy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet you did! I bet you lapped up the malted milk like a\nreg\xe2\x80\x99lar little devil!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen, the boy having served as introduction, they ignored him and\ncharged into real talk. Only Paul, sitting by himself, reading at a\nserial story in a newspaper, failed to join them, and all but Babbitt\nregarded him as a snob, an eccentric, a person of no spirit.\n\nWhich of them said which has never been determined, and does not matter,\nsince they all had the same ideas and expressed them always with the\nsame ponderous and brassy assurance. If it was not Babbitt who was\ndelivering any given verdict, at least he was beaming on the chancellor\nwho did deliver it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt that, though,\xe2\x80\x9d announced the first, \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re selling quite some booze\nin Zenith. Guess they are everywhere. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you fellows feel\nabout prohibition, but the way it strikes me is that it\xe2\x80\x99s a mighty\nbeneficial thing for the poor zob that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got any will-power but for\nfellows like us, it\xe2\x80\x99s an infringement of personal liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fact. Congress has got no right to interfere with a fellow\xe2\x80\x99s\npersonal liberty,\xe2\x80\x9d contended the second.\n\nA man came in from the car, but as all the seats were full he stood up\nwhile he smoked his cigarette. He was an Outsider; he was not one of the\nOld Families of the smoking-compartment. They looked upon him bleakly\nand, after trying to appear at ease by examining his chin in the mirror,\nhe gave it up and went out in silence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust been making a trip through the South. Business conditions not very\ngood down there,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the council.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that a fact! Not very good, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, didn\xe2\x80\x99t strike me they were up to normal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot up to normal, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly say they were.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe whole council nodded sagely and decided, \xe2\x80\x9cYump, not hardly up to\nsnuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, business conditions ain\xe2\x80\x99t what they ought to be out West,\nneither, not by a long shot.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fact. And I guess the hotel business feels it. That\xe2\x80\x99s one good\nthing, though: these hotels that\xe2\x80\x99ve been charging five bucks a day--yes,\nand maybe six-seven!--for a rotten room are going to be darn glad to get\nfour, and maybe give you a little service.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fact. Say, uh, speaknubout hotels, I hit the St. Francis at\nSan Francisco for the first time, the other day, and, say, it certainly\nis a first-class place.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re right, brother! The St. Francis is a swell place--absolutely\nA1.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fact. I\xe2\x80\x99m right with you. It\xe2\x80\x99s a first-class place.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYuh, but say, any of you fellows ever stay at the Rippleton, in\nChicago? I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to knock-- I believe in boosting wherever you\ncan--but say, of all the rotten dumps that pass \xe2\x80\x99emselves off as\nfirst-class hotels, that\xe2\x80\x99s the worst. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to _get_ those guys, one\nof these days, and I told \xe2\x80\x99em so. You know how I am--well, maybe you\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know, but I\xe2\x80\x99m accustomed to first-class accommodations, and I\xe2\x80\x99m\nperfectly willing to pay a reasonable price. I got into Chicago late the\nother night, and the Rippleton\xe2\x80\x99s near the station-- I\xe2\x80\x99d never been there\nbefore, but I says to the taxi-driver-- I always believe in taking a taxi\nwhen you get in late; may cost a little more money, but, gosh, it\xe2\x80\x99s\nworth it when you got to be up early next morning and out selling a lot\nof crabs--and I said to him, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, just drive me over to the Rippleton.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we got there, and I breezed up to the desk and said to the clerk,\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, brother, got a nice room with bath for Cousin Bill?\xe2\x80\x99 Saaaay!\nYou\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 thought I\xe2\x80\x99d sold him a second, or asked him to work on Yom\nKippur! He hands me the cold-boiled stare and yaps, \xe2\x80\x98I dunno, friend,\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll see,\xe2\x80\x99 and he ducks behind the rigamajig they keep track of the\nrooms on. Well, I guess he called up the Credit Association and the\nAmerican Security League to see if I was all right--he certainly took\nlong enough--or maybe he just went to sleep; but finally he comes out\nand looks at me like it hurts him, and croaks, \xe2\x80\x98I think I can let you\nhave a room with bath.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s awful nice of you--sorry to\ntrouble you--how much\xe2\x80\x99ll it set me back?\xe2\x80\x99 I says, real sweet. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99ll\ncost you seven bucks a day, friend,\xe2\x80\x99 he says.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it was late, and anyway, it went down on my\nexpense-account--gosh, if I\xe2\x80\x99d been paying it instead of the firm, I\xe2\x80\x99d\n\xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 tramped the streets all night before I\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 let any hick tavern\nstick me seven great big round dollars, believe me! So I lets it go at\nthat. Well, the clerk wakes a nice young bellhop--fine lad--not a day\nover seventy-nine years old--fought at the Battle of Gettysburg and\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t know it\xe2\x80\x99s over yet--thought I was one of the Confederates, I\nguess, from the way he looked at me--and Rip van Winkle took me up to\nsomething-- I found out afterwards they called it a room, but first I\nthought there\xe2\x80\x99d been some mistake-- I thought they were putting me in the\nSalvation Army collection-box! At seven _per_ each and every _diem_!\nGosh!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYuh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the Rippleton was pretty cheesy. Now, when I go to\nChicago I always stay at the Blackstone or the La Salle--first-class\nplaces.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, any of you fellows ever stay at the Birchdale at Terre Haute? How\nis it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the Birchdale is a first-class hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n(Twelve minutes of conference on the state of hotels in South Bend,\nFlint, Dayton, Tulsa, Wichita, Fort Worth, Winona, Erie, Fargo, and\nMoose Jaw.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeaknubout prices,\xe2\x80\x9d the man in the velour hat observed, fingering the\nelk-tooth on his heavy watch-chain, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to know where they get\nthis stuff about clothes coming down. Now, you take this suit I got on.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHe pinched his trousers-leg. \xe2\x80\x9cFour years ago I paid forty-two fifty for\nit, and it was real sure-\xe2\x80\x99nough value. Well, here the other day I went\ninto a store back home and asked to see a suit, and the fellow yanks out\nsome hand-me-downs that, honest, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put on a hired man. Just out\nof curiosity I asks him, \xe2\x80\x98What you charging for that junk?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Junk,\xe2\x80\x99 he\nsays, \xe2\x80\x98what d\xe2\x80\x99 you mean junk? That\xe2\x80\x99s a swell piece of goods, all wool--\xe2\x80\x99\nLike hell! It was nice vegetable wool, right off the Ole Plantation!\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s all wool,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98and we get sixty-seven ninety for it.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh,\nyou do, do you!\xe2\x80\x99 I says. \xe2\x80\x98Not from me you don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 I says, and I walks\nright out on him. You bet! I says to the wife, \xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98as long\nas your strength holds out and you can go on putting a few more patches\non papa\xe2\x80\x99s pants, we\xe2\x80\x99ll just pass up buying clothes.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right, brother. And just look at collars, frinstance--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey! Wait!\xe2\x80\x9d the fat man protested. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with collars? I\xe2\x80\x99m\nselling collars! D\xe2\x80\x99you realize the cost of labor on collars is still two\nhundred and seven per cent. above--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey voted that if their old friend the fat man sold collars, then the\nprice of collars was exactly what it should be; but all other clothing\nwas tragically too expensive. They admired and loved one another now.\nThey went profoundly into the science of business, and indicated that\nthe purpose of manufacturing a plow or a brick was so that it might be\nsold. To them, the Romantic Hero was no longer the knight, the wandering\npoet, the cowpuncher, the aviator, nor the brave young district\nattorney, but the great sales-manager, who had an Analysis of\nMerchandizing Problems on his glass-topped desk, whose title of nobility\nwas \xe2\x80\x9cGo-getter,\xe2\x80\x9d and who devoted himself and all his young samurai to\nthe cosmic purpose of Selling--not of selling anything in particular,\nfor or to anybody in particular, but pure Selling.\n\nThe shop-talk roused Paul Riesling. Though he was a player of violins\nand an interestingly unhappy husband, he was also a very able salesman\nof tar-roofing. He listened to the fat man\xe2\x80\x99s remarks on \xe2\x80\x9cthe value of\nhouse-organs and bulletins as a method of jazzing-up the Boys out on the\nroad;\xe2\x80\x9d and he himself offered one or two excellent thoughts on the use\nof two-cent stamps on circulars. Then he committed an offense against\nthe holy law of the Clan of Good Fellows. He became highbrow.\n\nThey were entering a city. On the outskirts they passed a steel-mill\nwhich flared in scarlet and orange flame that licked at the cadaverous\nstacks, at the iron-sheathed walls and sullen converters.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord, look at that--beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet it\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful, friend. That\xe2\x80\x99s the Shelling-Horton Steel Plant,\nand they tell me old John Shelling made a good three million bones out\nof munitions during the war!\xe2\x80\x9d the man with the velour hat said\nreverently.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean-- I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s lovely the way the light pulls that\npicturesque yard, all littered with junk, right out of the darkness,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Paul.\n\nThey stared at him, while Babbitt crowed, \xe2\x80\x9cPaul there has certainly got\none great little eye for picturesque places and quaint sights and all\nthat stuff. \xe2\x80\x99D of been an author or something if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t gone into the\nroofing line.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPaul looked annoyed. (Babbitt sometimes wondered if Paul appreciated his\nloyal boosting.) The man in the velour hat grunted, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, personally, I\nthink Shelling-Horton keep their works awful dirty. Bum routing. But I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t suppose there\xe2\x80\x99s any law against calling \xe2\x80\x99em \xe2\x80\x98picturesque\xe2\x80\x99 if it\ngets you that way!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPaul sulkily returned to his newspaper and the conversation logically\nmoved on to trains.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat time do we get into Pittsburg?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Babbitt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPittsburg? I think we get in at--no, that was last year\xe2\x80\x99s\nschedule--wait a minute--let\xe2\x80\x99s see--got a time-table right here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if we\xe2\x80\x99re on time?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYuh, sure, we must be just about on time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, we aren\xe2\x80\x99t--we were seven minutes late, last station.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere we? Straight? Why, gosh, I thought we were right on time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, we\xe2\x80\x99re about seven minutes late.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYuh, that\xe2\x80\x99s right; seven minutes late.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe porter entered--a negro in white jacket with brass buttons.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow late are we, George?\xe2\x80\x9d growled the fat man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Deed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, sir. I think we\xe2\x80\x99re about on time,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nporter, folding towels and deftly tossing them up on the rack above the\nwashbowls. The council stared at him gloomily and when he was gone they\nwailed:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s come over these niggers, nowadays. They never give\nyou a civil answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fact. They\xe2\x80\x99re getting so they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a single bit of\nrespect for you. The old-fashioned coon was a fine old cuss--he knew his\nplace--but these young dinges don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be porters or\ncotton-pickers. Oh, no! They got to be lawyers and professors and Lord\nknows what all! I tell you, it\xe2\x80\x99s becoming a pretty serious problem. We\nought to get together and show the black man, yes, and the yellow man,\nhis place. Now, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got one particle of race-prejudice. I\xe2\x80\x99m the\nfirst to be glad when a nigger succeeds--so long as he stays where he\nbelongs and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t try to usurp the rightful authority and business\nability of the white man.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the i.! And another thing we got to do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man with the\nvelour hat (whose name was Koplinsky), \xe2\x80\x9cis to keep these damn foreigners\nout of the country. Thank the Lord, we\xe2\x80\x99re putting a limit on\nimmigration. These Dagoes and Hunkies have got to learn that this is a\nwhite man\xe2\x80\x99s country, and they ain\xe2\x80\x99t wanted here. When we\xe2\x80\x99ve assimilated\nthe foreigners we got here now and learned \xe2\x80\x99em the principles of\nAmericanism and turned \xe2\x80\x99em into regular folks, why then maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll let\nin a few more.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet. That\xe2\x80\x99s a fact,\xe2\x80\x9d they observed, and passed on to lighter\ntopics. They rapidly reviewed motor-car prices, tire-mileage,\noil-stocks, fishing, and the prospects for the wheat-crop in Dakota.\n\nBut the fat man was impatient at this waste of time. He was a veteran\ntraveler and free of illusions. Already he had asserted that he was \xe2\x80\x9can\nold he-one.\xe2\x80\x9d He leaned forward, gathered in their attention by his\nexpression of sly humor, and grumbled, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, hell, boys, let\xe2\x80\x99s cut out\nthe formality and get down to the stories!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey became very lively and intimate.\n\nPaul and the boy vanished. The others slid forward on the long seat,\nunbuttoned their vests, thrust their feet up on the chairs, pulled the\nstately brass cuspidors nearer, and ran the green window-shade down on\nits little trolley, to shut them in from the uncomfortable strangeness\nof night. After each bark of laughter they cried, \xe2\x80\x9cSay, jever hear the\none about--\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt was expansive and virile. When the train stopped at\nan important station, the four men walked up and down the cement\nplatform, under the vast smoky train-shed roof, like a stormy sky, under\nthe elevated footways, beside crates of ducks and sides of beef, in the\nmystery of an unknown city. They strolled abreast, old friends and well\ncontent. At the long-drawn \xe2\x80\x9cAlllll aboarrrrrd\xe2\x80\x9d--like a mountain call at\ndusk--they hastened back into the smoking-compartment, and till two of\nthe morning continued the droll tales, their eyes damp with cigar-smoke\nand laughter. When they parted they shook hands, and chuckled, \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\nsir, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a great session. Sorry to bust it up. Mighty glad to met\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt lay awake in the close hot tomb of his Pullman berth, shaking\nwith remembrance of the fat man\xe2\x80\x99s limerick about the lady who wished to\nbe wild. He raised the shade; he lay with a puffy arm tucked between his\nhead and the skimpy pillow, looking out on the sliding silhouettes of\ntrees, and village lamps like exclamation-points. He was very happy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nI\n\nThey had four hours in New York between trains. The one thing Babbitt\nwished to see was the Pennsylvania Hotel, which had been built since his\nlast visit. He stared up at it, muttering, \xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-two hundred rooms and\ntwenty-two hundred baths! That\xe2\x80\x99s got everything in the world beat. Lord,\ntheir turnover must be--well, suppose price of rooms is four to eight\ndollars a day, and I suppose maybe some ten and--four times twenty-two\nhundred--say six times twenty-two hundred--well, anyway, with\nrestaurants and everything, say summers between eight and fifteen\nthousand a day. Every day! I never thought I\xe2\x80\x99d see a thing like that!\nSome town! Of course the average fellow in Zenith has got more\nIndividual Initiative than the fourflushers here, but I got to hand it\nto New York. Yes, sir, town, you\xe2\x80\x99re all right--some ways. Well, old\nPaulski, I guess we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen everything that\xe2\x80\x99s worth while. How\xe2\x80\x99ll we\nkill the rest of the time? Movie?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut Paul desired to see a liner. \xe2\x80\x9cAlways wanted to go to Europe--and, by\nthunder, I will, too, some day before I pass out,\xe2\x80\x9d he sighed.\n\nFrom a rough wharf on the North River they stared at the stern of the\n_Aquitania_ and her stacks and wireless antenn\xc3\xa6 lifted above the\ndock-house which shut her in.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy golly,\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt droned, \xe2\x80\x9cwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so bad to go over to the Old\nCountry and take a squint at all these ruins, and the place where\nShakespeare was born. And think of being able to order a drink whenever\nyou wanted one! Just range up to a bar and holler out loud, \xe2\x80\x98Gimme a\ncocktail, and darn the police!\xe2\x80\x99 Not bad at all. What juh like to see,\nover there, Paulibus?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPaul did not answer. Babbitt turned. Paul was standing with clenched\nfists, head drooping, staring at the liner as in terror. His thin body,\nseen against the summer-glaring planks of the wharf, was childishly\nmeager.\n\nAgain, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you hit for on the other side, Paul?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nScowling at the steamer, his breast heaving, Paul whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my\nGod!\xe2\x80\x9d While Babbitt watched him anxiously he snapped, \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, let\xe2\x80\x99s\nget out of this,\xe2\x80\x9d and hastened down the wharf, not looking back.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s funny,\xe2\x80\x9d considered Babbitt. \xe2\x80\x9cThe boy didn\xe2\x80\x99t care for seeing the\nocean boats after all. I thought he\xe2\x80\x99d be interested in \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nII\n\nThough he exulted, and made sage speculations about locomotive\nhorse-power, as their train climbed the Maine mountain-ridge and from\nthe summit he looked down the shining way among the pines; though he\nremarked, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, by golly!\xe2\x80\x9d when he discovered that the station at\nKatadumcook, the end of the line, was an aged freight-car; Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s\nmoment of impassioned release came when they sat on a tiny wharf on Lake\nSunasquam, awaiting the launch from the hotel. A raft had floated down\nthe lake; between the logs and the shore, the water was transparent,\nthin-looking, flashing with minnows. A guide in black felt hat with\ntrout-flies in the band, and flannel shirt of a peculiarly daring blue,\nsat on a log and whittled and was silent. A dog, a good country dog,\nblack and woolly gray, a dog rich in leisure and in meditation,\nscratched and grunted and slept. The thick sunlight was lavish on the\nbright water, on the rim of gold-green balsam boughs, the silver birches\nand tropic ferns, and across the lake it burned on the sturdy shoulders\nof the mountains. Over everything was a holy peace.\n\nSilent, they loafed on the edge of the wharf, swinging their legs above\nthe water. The immense tenderness of the place sank into Babbitt, and\nhe murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d just like to sit here--the rest of my life--and\nwhittle--and sit. And never hear a typewriter. Or Stan Graff fussing in\nthe \xe2\x80\x99phone. Or Rone and Ted scrapping. Just sit. Gosh!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe patted Paul\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cHow does it strike you, old snoozer?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s darn good, Georgie. There\xe2\x80\x99s something sort of eternal about\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFor once, Babbitt understood him.\n\n\nIII\n\nTheir launch rounded the bend; at the head of the lake, under a mountain\nslope, they saw the little central dining-shack of their hotel and the\ncrescent of squat log cottages which served as bedrooms. They landed,\nand endured the critical examination of the habitu\xc3\xa9s who had been at the\nhotel for a whole week. In their cottage, with its high stone fireplace,\nthey hastened, as Babbitt expressed it, to \xe2\x80\x9cget into some regular\nhe-togs.\xe2\x80\x9d They came out; Paul in an old gray suit and soft white shirt;\nBabbitt in khaki shirt and vast and flapping khaki trousers. It was\nexcessively new khaki; his rimless spectacles belonged to a city office;\nand his face was not tanned but a city pink. He made a discordant noise\nin the place. But with infinite satisfaction he slapped his legs and\ncrowed, \xe2\x80\x9cSay, this is getting back home, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey stood on the wharf before the hotel. He winked at Paul and drew\nfrom his back pocket a plug of chewing-tobacco, a vulgarism forbidden in\nthe Babbitt home. He took a chew, beaming and wagging his head as he\ntugged at it. \xe2\x80\x9cUm! Um! Maybe I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been hungry for a wad of\neating-tobacco! Have some?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey looked at each other in a grin of understanding. Paul took the\nplug, gnawed at it. They stood quiet, their jaws working. They solemnly\nspat, one after the other, into the placid water. They stretched\nvoluptuously, with lifted arms and arched backs. From beyond the\nmountains came the shuffling sound of a far-off train. A trout leaped,\nand fell back in a silver circle. They sighed together.\n\n\nIV\n\nThey had a week before their families came. Each evening they planned to\nget up early and fish before breakfast. Each morning they lay abed till\nthe breakfast-bell, pleasantly conscious that there were no efficient\nwives to rouse them. The mornings were cold; the fire was kindly as they\ndressed.\n\nPaul was distressingly clean, but Babbitt reveled in a good sound\ndirtiness, in not having to shave till his spirit was moved to it. He\ntreasured every grease spot and fish-scale on his new khaki trousers.\n\nAll morning they fished unenergetically, or tramped the dim and\naqueous-lighted trails among rank ferns and moss sprinkled with crimson\nbells. They slept all afternoon, and till midnight played stud-poker\nwith the guides. Poker was a serious business to the guides. They did\nnot gossip; they shuffled the thick greasy cards with a deft ferocity\nmenacing to the \xe2\x80\x9csports;\xe2\x80\x9d and Joe Paradise, king of guides, was\nsarcastic to loiterers who halted the game even to scratch.\n\nAt midnight, as Paul and he blundered to their cottage over the pungent\nwet grass, and pine-roots confusing in the darkness, Babbitt rejoiced\nthat he did not have to explain to his wife where he had been all\nevening.\n\nThey did not talk much. The nervous loquacity and opinionation of the\nZenith Athletic Club dropped from them. But when they did talk they\nslipped into the na\xc3\xafve intimacy of college days. Once they drew their\ncanoe up to the bank of Sunasquam Water, a stream walled in by the dense\ngreen of the hardhack. The sun roared on the green jungle but in the\nshade was sleepy peace, and the water was golden and rippling. Babbitt\ndrew his hand through the cool flood, and mused:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe never thought we\xe2\x80\x99d come to Maine together!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. We\xe2\x80\x99ve never done anything the way we thought we would. I expected\nto live in Germany with my granddad\xe2\x80\x99s people, and study the fiddle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so. And remember how I wanted to be a lawyer and go into\npolitics? I still think I might have made a go of it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve kind of got\nthe gift of the gab--anyway, I can think on my feet, and make some kind\nof a spiel on most anything, and of course that\xe2\x80\x99s the thing you need in\npolitics. By golly, Ted\xe2\x80\x99s going to law-school, even if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t! Well-- I\nguess it\xe2\x80\x99s worked out all right. Myra\xe2\x80\x99s been a fine wife. And Zilla\nmeans well, Paulibus.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Up here, I figure out all sorts of plans to keep her amused. I\nkind of feel life is going to be different, now that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting a\ngood rest and can go back and start over again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so, old boy.\xe2\x80\x9d Shyly: \xe2\x80\x9cSay, gosh, it\xe2\x80\x99s been awful nice to sit\naround and loaf and gamble and act regular, with you along, you old\nhorse-thief!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know what it means to me, Georgie. Saved my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe shame of emotion overpowered them; they cursed a little, to prove\nthey were good rough fellows; and in a mellow silence, Babbitt whistling\nwhile Paul hummed, they paddled back to the hotel.\n\n\nV\n\nThough it was Paul who had seemed overwrought, Babbitt who had been the\nprotecting big brother, Paul became clear-eyed and merry, while Babbitt\nsank into irritability. He uncovered layer on layer of hidden weariness.\nAt first he had played nimble jester to Paul and for him sought\namusements; by the end of the week Paul was nurse, and Babbitt accepted\nfavors with the condescension one always shows a patient nurse.\n\nThe day before their families arrived, the women guests at the hotel\nbubbled, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it nice! You must be so excited;\xe2\x80\x9d and the\nproprieties compelled Babbitt and Paul to look excited. But they went to\nbed early and grumpy.\n\nWhen Myra appeared she said at once, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, we want you boys to go on\nplaying around just as if we weren\xe2\x80\x99t here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe first evening, he stayed out for poker with the guides, and she said\nin placid merriment, \xe2\x80\x9cMy! You\xe2\x80\x99re a regular bad one!\xe2\x80\x9d The second evening,\nshe groaned sleepily, \xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens, are you going to be out every\nsingle night?\xe2\x80\x9d The third evening, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t play poker.\n\nHe was tired now in every cell. \xe2\x80\x9cFunny! Vacation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have\ndone me a bit of good,\xe2\x80\x9d he lamented. \xe2\x80\x9cPaul\xe2\x80\x99s frisky as a colt, but I\nswear, I\xe2\x80\x99m crankier and nervouser than when I came up here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe had three weeks of Maine. At the end of the second week he began to\nfeel calm, and interested in life. He planned an expedition to climb\nSachem Mountain, and wanted to camp overnight at Box Car Pond. He was\ncuriously weak, yet cheerful, as though he had cleansed his veins of\npoisonous energy and was filling them with wholesome blood.\n\nHe ceased to be irritated by Ted\xe2\x80\x99s infatuation with a waitress (his\nseventh tragic affair this year); he played catch with Ted, and with\npride taught him to cast a fly in the pine-shadowed silence of Skowtuit\nPond.\n\nAt the end he sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cHang it, I\xe2\x80\x99m just beginning to enjoy my vacation.\nBut, well, I feel a lot better. And it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be one great year!\nMaybe the Real Estate Board will elect me president, instead of some\nfuzzy old-fashioned faker like Chan Mott.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn the way home, whenever he went into the smoking-compartment he felt\nguilty at deserting his wife and angry at being expected to feel guilty,\nbut each time he triumphed, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, this is going to be a great year, a\ngreat old year!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nI\n\nAll the way home from Maine, Babbitt was certain that he was a changed\nman. He was converted to serenity. He was going to cease worrying about\nbusiness. He was going to have more \xe2\x80\x9cinterests\xe2\x80\x9d--theaters, public\naffairs, reading. And suddenly, as he finished an especially heavy\ncigar, he was going to stop smoking.\n\nHe invented a new and perfect method. He would buy no tobacco; he would\ndepend on borrowing it; and, of course, he would be ashamed to borrow\noften. In a spasm of righteousness he flung his cigar-case out of the\nsmoking-compartment window. He went back and was kind to his wife about\nnothing in particular; he admired his own purity, and decided,\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely simple. Just a matter of will-power.\xe2\x80\x9d He started a magazine\nserial about a scientific detective. Ten miles on, he was conscious that\nhe desired to smoke. He ducked his head, like a turtle going into its\nshell; he appeared uneasy; he skipped two pages in his story and didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nknow it. Five miles later, he leaped up and sought the porter. \xe2\x80\x9cSay, uh,\nGeorge, have you got a--\xe2\x80\x9d The porter looked patient. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you got a\ntime-table?\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt finished. At the next stop he went out and bought a\ncigar. Since it was to be his last before he reached Zenith, he finished\nit down to an inch stub.\n\nFour days later he again remembered that he had stopped smoking, but he\nwas too busy catching up with his office-work to keep it remembered.\n\n\nII\n\nBaseball, he determined, would be an excellent hobby. \xe2\x80\x9cNo sense a man\xe2\x80\x99s\nworking his fool head off. I\xe2\x80\x99m going out to the Game three times a\nweek. Besides, fellow ought to support the home team.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe did go and support the team, and enhance the glory of Zenith, by\nyelling \xe2\x80\x9cAttaboy!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cRotten!\xe2\x80\x9d He performed the rite scrupulously. He\nwore a cotton handkerchief about his collar; he became sweaty; he opened\nhis mouth in a wide loose grin; and drank lemon soda out of a bottle. He\nwent to the Game three times a week, for one week. Then he compromised\non watching the _Advocate-Times_ bulletin-board. He stood in the\nthickest and steamiest of the crowd, and as the boy up on the lofty\nplatform recorded the achievements of Big Bill Bostwick, the pitcher,\nBabbitt remarked to complete strangers, \xe2\x80\x9cPretty nice! Good work!\xe2\x80\x9d and\nhastened back to the office.\n\nHe honestly believed that he loved baseball. It is true that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t,\nin twenty-five years, himself played any baseball except back-lot catch\nwith Ted--very gentle, and strictly limited to ten minutes. But the game\nwas a custom of his clan, and it gave outlet for the homicidal and\nsides-taking instincts which Babbitt called \xe2\x80\x9cpatriotism\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clove of\nsport.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs he approached the office he walked faster and faster, muttering,\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuess better hustle.\xe2\x80\x9d All about him the city was hustling, for\nhustling\xe2\x80\x99s sake. Men in motors were hustling to pass one another in the\nhustling traffic. Men were hustling to catch trolleys, with another\ntrolley a minute behind, and to leap from the trolleys, to gallop across\nthe sidewalk, to hurl themselves into buildings, into hustling express\nelevators. Men in dairy lunches were hustling to gulp down the food\nwhich cooks had hustled to fry. Men in barber shops were snapping, \xe2\x80\x9cJus\xe2\x80\x99\nshave me once over. Gotta hustle.\xe2\x80\x9d Men were feverishly getting rid of\nvisitors in offices adorned with the signs, \xe2\x80\x9cThis Is My Busy Day\xe2\x80\x9d and\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord Created the World in Six Days--You Can Spiel All You Got to\nSay in Six Minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d Men who had made five thousand, year before last,\nand ten thousand last year, were urging on nerve-yelping bodies and\nparched brains so that they might make twenty thousand this year; and\nthe men who had broken down immediately after making their twenty\nthousand dollars were hustling to catch trains, to hustle through the\nvacations which the hustling doctors had ordered.\n\nAmong them Babbitt hustled back to his office, to sit down with nothing\nmuch to do except see that the staff looked as though they were\nhustling.\n\n\nIII\n\nEvery Saturday afternoon he hustled out to his country club and hustled\nthrough nine holes of golf as a rest after the week\xe2\x80\x99s hustle.\n\nIn Zenith it was as necessary for a Successful Man to belong to a\ncountry club as it was to wear a linen collar. Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s was the Outing\nGolf and Country Club, a pleasant gray-shingled building with a broad\nporch, on a daisy-starred cliff above Lake Kennepoose. There was\nanother, the Tonawanda Country Club, to which belonged Charles McKelvey,\nHorace Updike, and the other rich men who lunched not at the Athletic\nbut at the Union Club. Babbitt explained with frequency, \xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\nhire me to join the Tonawanda, even if I did have a hundred and eighty\nbucks to throw away on the initiation fee. At the Outing we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a\nbunch of real human fellows, and the finest lot of little women in\ntown--just as good at joshing as the men--but at the Tonawanda there\xe2\x80\x99s\nnothing but these would-be\xe2\x80\x99s in New York get-ups, drinking tea! Too much\ndog altogether. Why, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t join the Tonawanda even if they-- I\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t join it on a bet!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen he had played four or five holes, he relaxed a bit, his\ntobacco-fluttering heart beat more normally, and his voice slowed to the\ndrawling of his hundred generations of peasant ancestors.\n\n\nIV\n\nAt least once a week Mr. and Mrs. Babbitt and Tinka went to the movies.\nTheir favorite motion-picture theater was the Ch\xc3\xa2teau, which held three\nthousand spectators and had an orchestra of fifty pieces which played\nArrangements from the Operas and suites portraying a Day on the Farm, or\na Four-alarm Fire. In the stone rotunda, decorated with\ncrown-embroidered velvet chairs and almost medieval tapestries,\nparrakeets sat on gilded lotos columns.\n\nWith exclamations of \xe2\x80\x9cWell, by golly!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cYou got to go some to beat\nthis dump!\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt admired the Ch\xc3\xa2teau. As he stared across the\nthousands of heads, a gray plain in the dimness, as he smelled good\nclothes and mild perfume and chewing-gum, he felt as when he had first\nseen a mountain and realized how very, very much earth and rock there\nwas in it.\n\nHe liked three kinds of films: pretty bathing girls with bare legs;\npolicemen or cowboys and an industrious shooting of revolvers; and funny\nfat men who ate spaghetti. He chuckled with immense, moist-eyed\nsentimentality at interludes portraying puppies, kittens, and chubby\nbabies; and he wept at deathbeds and old mothers being patient in\nmortgaged cottages. Mrs. Babbitt preferred the pictures in which\nhandsome young women in elaborate frocks moved through sets ticketed as\nthe drawing-rooms of New York millionaires. As for Tinka, she preferred,\nor was believed to prefer, whatever her parents told her to.\n\nAll his relaxations--baseball, golf, movies, bridge, motoring, long\ntalks with Paul at the Athletic Club, or at the Good Red Beef and Old\nEnglish Chop House--were necessary to Babbitt, for he was entering a\nyear of such activity as he had never known.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nI\n\nIt was by accident that Babbitt had his opportunity to address the S. A.\nR. E. B.\n\nThe S. A. R. E. B., as its members called it, with the universal passion\nfor mysterious and important-sounding initials, was the State\nAssociation of Real Estate Boards; the organization of brokers and\noperators. It was to hold its annual convention at Monarch, Zenith\xe2\x80\x99s\nchief rival among the cities of the state. Babbitt was an official\ndelegate; another was Cecil Rountree, whom Babbitt admired for his\npicaresque speculative building, and hated for his social position, for\nbeing present at the smartest dances on Royal Ridge. Rountree was\nchairman of the convention program-committee.\n\nBabbitt had growled to him, \xe2\x80\x9cMakes me tired the way these doctors and\nprofs and preachers put on lugs about being \xe2\x80\x98professional men.\xe2\x80\x99 A good\nrealtor has to have more knowledge and finesse than any of \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight you are! I say: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you put that into a paper, and give it\nat the S. A. R. E. B.?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Rountree.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if it would help you in making up the program-- Tell you: the way\nI look at it is this: First place, we ought to insist that folks call us\n\xe2\x80\x98realtors\xe2\x80\x99 and not \xe2\x80\x98real-estate men.\xe2\x80\x99 Sounds more like a reg\xe2\x80\x99lar\nprofession. Second place-- What is it distinguishes a profession from a\nmere trade, business, or occupation? What is it? Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s the public\nservice and the skill, the trained skill, and the knowledge and, uh, all\nthat, whereas a fellow that merely goes out for the jack, he never\nconsiders the--public service and trained skill and so on. Now as a\nprofessional--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather! That\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly bully! Perfectly corking! Now you write it in\na paper,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rountree, as he rapidly and firmly moved away.\n\n\nII\n\nHowever accustomed to the literary labors of advertisements and\ncorrespondence, Babbitt was dismayed on the evening when he sat down to\nprepare a paper which would take a whole ten minutes to read.\n\nHe laid out a new fifteen-cent school exercise-book on his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\ncollapsible sewing-table, set up for the event in the living-room. The\nhousehold had been bullied into silence; Verona and Ted requested to\ndisappear, and Tinka threatened with \xe2\x80\x9cIf I hear one sound out of you--if\nyou holler for a glass of water one single solitary time-- You better\nnot, that\xe2\x80\x99s all!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Babbitt sat over by the piano, making a nightgown\nand gazing with respect while Babbitt wrote in the exercise-book, to the\nrhythmical wiggling and squeaking of the sewing-table.\n\nWhen he rose, damp and jumpy, and his throat dusty from cigarettes, she\nmarveled, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see how you can just sit down and make up things\nright out of your own head!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s the training in constructive imagination that a fellow gets in\nmodern business life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe had written seven pages, whereof the first page set forth:\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe other six pages were rather like the first.\n\nFor a week he went about looking important. Every morning, as he\ndressed, he thought aloud: \xe2\x80\x9cJever stop to consider, Myra, that before a\ntown can have buildings or prosperity or any of those things, some\nrealtor has got to sell \xe2\x80\x99em the land? All civilization starts with him.\nJever realize that?\xe2\x80\x9d At the Athletic Club he led unwilling men aside to\ninquire, \xe2\x80\x9cSay, if you had to read a paper before a big convention, would\nyou start in with the funny stories or just kind of scatter \xe2\x80\x99em all\nthrough?\xe2\x80\x9d He asked Howard Littlefield for a \xe2\x80\x9cset of statistics about\nreal-estate sales; something good and impressive,\xe2\x80\x9d and Littlefield\nprovided something exceedingly good and impressive.\n\nBut it was to T. Cholmondeley Frink that Babbitt most often turned. He\ncaught Frink at the club every noon, and demanded, while Frink\nlooked hunted and evasive, \xe2\x80\x9cSay, Chum--you\xe2\x80\x99re a shark on this\nwriting stuff--how would you put this sentence, see here in my\nmanuscript--manuscript--now where the deuce is that?--oh, yes, here.\nWould you say \xe2\x80\x98We ought not also to alone think?\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98We ought also not\nto think alone?\xe2\x80\x99 or--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOne evening when his wife was away and he had no one to impress, Babbitt\nforgot about Style, Order, and the other mysteries, and scrawled off\nwhat he really thought about the real-estate business and about himself,\nand he found the paper written. When he read it to his wife she yearned,\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, dear, it\xe2\x80\x99s splendid; beautifully written, and so clear and\ninteresting, and such splendid ideas! Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s just--it\xe2\x80\x99s just\nsplendid!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNext day he cornered Chum Frink and crowed, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, old son, I finished\nit last evening! Just lammed it out! I used to think you writing-guys\nmust have a hard job making up pieces, but Lord, it\xe2\x80\x99s a cinch. Pretty\nsoft for you fellows; you certainly earn your money easy! Some day when\nI get ready to retire, guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll take to writing and show you boys how\nto do it. I always used to think I could write better stuff, and more\npunch and originality, than all this stuff you see printed, and now I\xe2\x80\x99m\ndoggone sure of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe had four copies of the paper typed in black with a gorgeous red\ntitle, had them bound in pale blue manilla, and affably presented one to\nold Ira Runyon, the managing editor of the _Advocate-Times_, who said\nyes, indeed yes, he was very glad to have it, and he certainly would\nread it all through--as soon as he could find time.\n\nMrs. Babbitt could not go to Monarch. She had a women\xe2\x80\x99s-club meeting.\nBabbitt said that he was very sorry.\n\n\nIII\n\nBesides the five official delegates to the convention--Babbitt,\nRountree, W. A. Rogers, Alvin Thayer, and Elbert Wing--there were fifty\nunofficial delegates, most of them with their wives.\n\nThey met at the Union Station for the midnight train to Monarch. All of\nthem, save Cecil Rountree, who was such a snob that he never wore\nbadges, displayed celluloid buttons the size of dollars and lettered \xe2\x80\x9cWe\nzoom for Zenith.\xe2\x80\x9d The official delegates were magnificent with silver\nand magenta ribbons. Martin Lumsen\xe2\x80\x99s little boy Willy carried a tasseled\nbanner inscribed \xe2\x80\x9cZenith the Zip City--Zeal, Zest and Zowie--1,000,000\nin 1935.\xe2\x80\x9d As the delegates arrived, not in taxicabs but in the family\nautomobile driven by the oldest son or by Cousin Fred, they formed\nimpromptu processions through the station waiting-room.\n\nIt was a new and enormous waiting-room, with marble pilasters, and\nfrescoes depicting the exploration of the Chaloosa River Valley by P\xc3\xa8re\nEmile Fauthoux in 1740. The benches were shelves of ponderous mahogany;\nthe news-stand a marble kiosk with a brass grill. Down the echoing\nspaces of the hall the delegates paraded after Willy Lumsen\xe2\x80\x99s banner,\nthe men waving their cigars, the women conscious of their new frocks\nand strings of beads, all singing to the tune of Auld Lang Syne the\nofficial City Song, written by Chum Frink:\n\n      Good old Zenith,\n      Our kin and kith,\n    Wherever we may be,\n      Hats in the ring,\n      We blithely sing\n    Of thy Prosperity.\n\nWarren Whitby, the broker, who had a gift of verse for banquets and\nbirthdays, had added to Frink\xe2\x80\x99s City Song a special verse for the\nrealtors\xe2\x80\x99 convention:\n\n      Oh, here we come,\n      The fellows from\n    Zenith, the Zip Citee.\n      We wish to state\n      In real estate\n    There\xe2\x80\x99s none so live as we.\n\nBabbitt was stirred to hysteric patriotism. He leaped on a bench,\nshouting to the crowd:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with Zenith?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s all right!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s best ole town in the U. S. A.?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cZeeeeeen-ith!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe patient poor people waiting for the midnight train stared in\nunenvious wonder--Italian women with shawls, old weary men with broken\nshoes, roving road-wise boys in suits which had been flashy when they\nwere new but which were faded now and wrinkled.\n\nBabbitt perceived that as an official delegate he must be more\ndignified. With Wing and Rogers he tramped up and down the cement\nplatform beside the waiting Pullmans. Motor-driven baggage-trucks and\nred-capped porters carrying bags sped down the platform with an\nagreeable effect of activity. Arc-lights glared and stammered overhead.\nThe glossy yellow sleeping-cars shone impressively. Babbitt made his\nvoice to be measured and lordly; he thrust out his abdomen and rumbled,\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe got to see to it that the convention lets the Legislature understand\njust where they get off in this matter of taxing realty transfers.\xe2\x80\x9d Wing\nuttered approving grunts and Babbitt swelled--gloated--\n\nThe blind of a Pullman compartment was raised, and Babbitt looked into\nan unfamiliar world. The occupant of the compartment was Lucile\nMcKelvey, the pretty wife of the millionaire contractor. Possibly,\nBabbitt thrilled, she was going to Europe! On the seat beside her was a\nbunch of orchids and violets, and a yellow paper-bound book which seemed\nforeign. While he stared, she picked up the book, then glanced out of\nthe window as though she was bored. She must have looked straight at\nhim, and he had met her, but she gave no sign. She languidly pulled down\nthe blind, and he stood still, a cold feeling of insignificance in his\nheart.\n\nBut on the train his pride was restored by meeting delegates from\nSparta, Pioneer, and other smaller cities of the state, who listened\nrespectfully when, as a magnifico from the metropolis of Zenith, he\nexplained politics and the value of a Good Sound Business\nAdministration. They fell joyfully into shop-talk, the purest and most\nrapturous form of conversation:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99d this fellow Rountree make out with this big apartment-hotel he\nwas going to put up? Whadde do? Get out bonds to finance it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a\nSparta broker.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Babbitt. \xe2\x80\x9cNow if I\xe2\x80\x99d been handling it--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo,\xe2\x80\x9d Elbert Wing was droning, \xe2\x80\x9cI hired this shop-window for a week, and\nput up a big sign, \xe2\x80\x98Toy Town for Tiny Tots,\xe2\x80\x99 and stuck in a lot of doll\nhouses and some dinky little trees, and then down at the bottom, \xe2\x80\x98Baby\nLikes This Dollydale, but Papa and Mama Will Prefer Our Beautiful\nBungalows,\xe2\x80\x99 and you know, that certainly got folks talking, and first\nweek we sold--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe trucks sang \xe2\x80\x9clickety-lick, lickety-lick\xe2\x80\x9d as the train ran through\nthe factory district. Furnaces spurted flame, and power-hammers were\nclanging. Red lights, green lights, furious white lights rushed past,\nand Babbitt was important again, and eager.\n\n\nIV\n\nHe did a voluptuous thing: he had his clothes pressed on the train. In\nthe morning, half an hour before they reached Monarch, the porter came\nto his berth and whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a drawing-room vacant, sir. I put\nyour suit in there.\xe2\x80\x9d In tan autumn overcoat over his pajamas, Babbitt\nslipped down the green-curtain-lined aisle to the glory of his first\nprivate compartment. The porter indicated that he knew Babbitt was used\nto a man-servant; he held the ends of Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s trousers, that the\nbeautifully sponged garment might not be soiled, filled the bowl in the\nprivate washroom, and waited with a towel.\n\nTo have a private washroom was luxurious. However enlivening a Pullman\nsmoking-compartment was by night, even to Babbitt it was depressing in\nthe morning, when it was jammed with fat men in woolen undershirts,\nevery hook filled with wrinkled cottony shirts, the leather seat piled\nwith dingy toilet-kits, and the air nauseating with the smell of soap\nand toothpaste. Babbitt did not ordinarily think much of privacy, but\nnow he reveled in it, reveled in his valet, and purred with pleasure as\nhe gave the man a tip of a dollar and a half.\n\nHe rather hoped that he was being noticed as, in his newly pressed\nclothes, with the adoring porter carrying his suit-case, he disembarked\nat Monarch.\n\nHe was to share a room at the Hotel Sedgwick with W. A. Rogers, that\nshrewd, rustic-looking Zenith dealer in farm-lands. Together they had a\nnoble breakfast, with waffles, and coffee not in exiguous cups but in\nlarge pots. Babbitt grew expansive, and told Rogers about the art of\nwriting; he gave a bellboy a quarter to fetch a morning newspaper from\nthe lobby, and sent to Tinka a post-card: \xe2\x80\x9cPapa wishes you were here to\nbat round with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nV\n\nThe meetings of the convention were held in the ballroom of the Allen\nHouse. In an anteroom was the office of the chairman of the executive\ncommittee. He was the busiest man in the convention; he was so busy that\nhe got nothing done whatever. He sat at a marquetry table, in a room\nlittered with crumpled paper and, all day long, town-boosters and\nlobbyists and orators who wished to lead debates came and whispered to\nhim, whereupon he looked vague, and said rapidly, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s a\nfine idea; we\xe2\x80\x99ll do that,\xe2\x80\x9d and instantly forgot all about it, lighted a\ncigar and forgot that too, while the telephone rang mercilessly and\nabout him men kept beseeching, \xe2\x80\x9cSay, Mr. Chairman--say, Mr. Chairman!\xe2\x80\x9d\nwithout penetrating his exhausted hearing.\n\nIn the exhibit-room were plans of the new suburbs of Sparta, pictures of\nthe new state capitol, at Galop de Vache, and large ears of corn with\nthe label, \xe2\x80\x9cNature\xe2\x80\x99s Gold, from Shelby County, the Garden Spot of God\xe2\x80\x99s\nOwn Country.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe real convention consisted of men muttering in hotel bedrooms or in\ngroups amid the badge-spotted crowd in the hotel-lobby, but there was a\nshow of public meetings.\n\nThe first of them opened with a welcome by the mayor of Monarch. The\npastor of the First Christian Church of Monarch, a large man with a long\ndamp frontal lock, informed God that the real-estate men were here now.\n\nThe venerable Minnemagantic realtor, Major Carlton Tuke, read a paper in\nwhich he denounced co\xc3\xb6perative stores. William A. Larkin of Eureka gave\na comforting prognosis of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Prospects for Increased Construction,\xe2\x80\x9d\nand reminded them that plate-glass prices were two points lower.\n\nThe convention was on.\n\nThe delegates were entertained, incessantly and firmly. The Monarch\nChamber of Commerce gave them a banquet, and the Manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99\nAssociation an afternoon reception, at which a chrysanthemum was\npresented to each of the ladies, and to each of the men a leather\nbill-fold inscribed \xe2\x80\x9cFrom Monarch the Mighty Motor Mart.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMrs. Crosby Knowlton, wife of the manufacturer of Fleetwing Automobiles,\nopened her celebrated Italian garden and served tea. Six hundred\nreal-estate men and wives ambled down the autumnal paths. Perhaps three\nhundred of them were quietly inconspicuous; perhaps three hundred\nvigorously exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is pretty slick, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d surreptitiously picked\nthe late asters and concealed them in their pockets, and tried to get\nnear enough to Mrs. Knowlton to shake her lovely hand. Without request,\nthe Zenith delegates (except Rountree) gathered round a marble dancing\nnymph and sang \xe2\x80\x9cHere we come, the fellows from Zenith, the Zip Citee.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt chanced that all the delegates from Pioneer belonged to the Brotherly\nand Protective Order of Elks, and they produced an enormous banner\nlettered: \xe2\x80\x9cB. P. O. E.--Best People on Earth--Boost Pioneer, Oh Eddie.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNor was Galop de Vache, the state capital, to be slighted. The leader of\nthe Galop de Vache delegation was a large, reddish, roundish man, but\nactive. He took off his coat, hurled his broad black felt hat on the\nground, rolled up his sleeves, climbed upon the sundial, spat, and\nbellowed:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll tell the world, and the good lady who\xe2\x80\x99s giving the show this\nafternoon, that the bonniest burg in this man\xe2\x80\x99s state is Galop de Vache.\nYou boys can talk about your zip, but jus\xe2\x80\x99 lemme murmur that old Galop\nhas the largest proportion of home-owning citizens in the state; and\nwhen folks own their homes, they ain\xe2\x80\x99t starting labor-troubles, and\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re raising kids instead of raising hell! Galop de Vache! The town\nfor homey folks! The town that eats \xe2\x80\x99em alive oh, Bosco!\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll--tell--the--world!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe guests drove off; the garden shivered into quiet. But Mrs. Crosby\nKnowlton sighed as she looked at a marble seat warm from five hundred\nsummers of Amalfi. On the face of a winged sphinx which supported it\nsome one had drawn a mustache in lead-pencil. Crumpled paper napkins\nwere dumped among the Michaelmas daisies. On the walk, like shredded\nlovely flesh, were the petals of the last gallant rose. Cigarette stubs\nfloated in the goldfish pool, trailing an evil stain as they swelled and\ndisintegrated, and beneath the marble seat, the fragments carefully put\ntogether, was a smashed teacup.\n\n\nVI\n\nAs he rode back to the hotel Babbitt reflected, \xe2\x80\x9cMyra would have enjoyed\nall this social agony.\xe2\x80\x9d For himself he cared less for the garden party\nthan for the motor tours which the Monarch Chamber of Commerce had\narranged. Indefatigably he viewed water-reservoirs, suburban\ntrolley-stations, and tanneries. He devoured the statistics which were\ngiven to him, and marveled to his roommate, W. A. Rogers, \xe2\x80\x9cOf course\nthis town isn\xe2\x80\x99t a patch on Zenith; it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got our outlook and natural\nresources; but did you know--I nev\xe2\x80\x99 did till to-day--that they\nmanufactured seven hundred and sixty-three million feet of lumber last\nyear? What d\xe2\x80\x99 you think of that!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe was nervous as the time for reading his paper approached. When he\nstood on the low platform before the convention, he trembled and saw\nonly a purple haze. But he was in earnest, and when he had finished the\nformal paper he talked to them, his hands in his pockets, his spectacled\nface a flashing disk, like a plate set up on edge in the lamplight. They\nshouted \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the stuff!\xe2\x80\x9d and in the discussion afterward they\nreferred with impressiveness to \xe2\x80\x9cour friend and brother, Mr. George F.\nBabbitt.\xe2\x80\x9d He had in fifteen minutes changed from a minor delegate to a\npersonage almost as well known as that diplomat of business, Cecil\nRountree. After the meeting, delegates from all over the state said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cHower you, Brother Babbitt?\xe2\x80\x9d Sixteen complete strangers called him\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge,\xe2\x80\x9d and three men took him into corners to confide, \xe2\x80\x9cMighty glad\nyou had the courage to stand up and give the Profession a real boost.\nNow I\xe2\x80\x99ve always maintained--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNext morning, with tremendous casualness, Babbitt asked the girl at the\nhotel news-stand for the newspapers from Zenith. There was nothing in\nthe _Press_, but in the _Advocate-Times_, on the third page-- He gasped.\nThey had printed his picture and a half-column account. The heading was\n\xe2\x80\x9cSensation at Annual Land-men\xe2\x80\x99s Convention. G. F. Babbitt, Prominent\nZiptown Realtor, Keynoter in Fine Address.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe murmured reverently, \xe2\x80\x9cI guess some of the folks on Floral Heights\nwill sit up and take notice now, and pay a little attention to old\nGeorgie!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nVII\n\nIt was the last meeting. The delegations were presenting the claims of\ntheir several cities to the next year\xe2\x80\x99s convention. Orators were\nannouncing that \xe2\x80\x9cGalop de Vache, the Capital City, the site of Kremer\nCollege and of the Upholtz Knitting Works, is the recognized center of\nculture and high-class enterprise;\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cHamburg, the Big Little\nCity with the Logical Location, where every man is open-handed and every\nwoman a heaven-born hostess, throws wide to you her hospitable gates.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the midst of these more diffident invitations, the golden doors of\nthe ballroom opened with a blatting of trumpets, and a circus parade\nrolled in. It was composed of the Zenith brokers, dressed as\ncowpunchers, bareback riders, Japanese jugglers. At the head was big\nWarren Whitby, in the bearskin and gold-and-crimson coat of a\ndrum-major. Behind him, as a clown, beating a bass drum, extraordinarily\nhappy and noisy, was Babbitt.\n\nWarren Whitby leaped on the platform, made merry play with his baton,\nand observed, \xe2\x80\x9cBoyses and girlses, the time has came to get down to\ncases. A dyed-in-the-wool Zenithite sure loves his neighbors, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve\nmade up our minds to grab this convention off our neighbor burgs like\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve grabbed the condensed-milk business and the paper-box business\nand--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJ. Harry Barmhill, the convention chairman, hinted, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re grateful to\nyou, Mr. Uh, but you must give the other boys a chance to hand in their\nbids now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA fog-horn voice blared, \xe2\x80\x9cIn Eureka we\xe2\x80\x99ll promise free motor rides\nthrough the prettiest country--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRunning down the aisle, clapping his hands, a lean bald young man cried,\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m from Sparta! Our Chamber of Commerce has wired me they\xe2\x80\x99ve set aside\neight thousand dollars, in real money, for the entertainment of the\nconvention!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA clerical-looking man rose to clamor, \xe2\x80\x9cMoney talks! Move we accept the\nbid from Sparta!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was accepted.\n\n\nVIII\n\nThe Committee on Resolutions was reporting. They said that Whereas\nAlmighty God in his beneficent mercy had seen fit to remove to a sphere\nof higher usefulness some thirty-six realtors of the state the past\nyear, Therefore it was the sentiment of this convention assembled that\nthey were sorry God had done it, and the secretary should be, and hereby\nwas, instructed to spread these resolutions on the minutes, and to\nconsole the bereaved families by sending them each a copy.\n\nA second resolution authorized the president of the S.A.R.E.B. to spend\nfifteen thousand dollars in lobbying for sane tax measures in the State\nLegislature. This resolution had a good deal to say about Menaces to\nSound Business and clearing the Wheels of Progress from ill-advised and\nshort-sighted obstacles.\n\nThe Committee on Committees reported, and with startled awe Babbitt\nlearned that he had been appointed a member of the Committee on Torrens\nTitles.\n\nHe rejoiced, \xe2\x80\x9cI said it was going to be a great year! Georgie, old son,\nyou got big things ahead of you! You\xe2\x80\x99re a natural-born orator and a good\nmixer and-- Zowie!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nIX\n\nThere was no formal entertainment provided for the last evening. Babbitt\nhad planned to go home, but that afternoon the Jered Sassburgers of\nPioneer suggested that Babbitt and W. A. Rogers have tea with them at\nthe Catalpa Inn.\n\nTeas were not unknown to Babbitt--his wife and he earnestly attended\nthem at least twice a year--but they were sufficiently exotic to make\nhim feel important. He sat at a glass-covered table in the Art Room of\nthe Inn, with its painted rabbits, mottoes lettered on birch bark, and\nwaitresses being artistic in Dutch caps; he ate insufficient lettuce\nsandwiches, and was lively and naughty with Mrs. Sassburger, who was as\nsmooth and large-eyed as a cloak-model. Sassburger and he had met two\ndays before, so they were calling each other \xe2\x80\x9cGeorgie\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSassy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSassburger said prayerfully, \xe2\x80\x9cSay, boys, before you go, seeing this is\nthe last chance, I\xe2\x80\x99ve _got it_, up in my room, and Miriam here is the\nbest little mixologist in the Stati Unidos, like us Italians say.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith wide flowing gestures, Babbitt and Rogers followed the Sassburgers\nto their room. Mrs. Sassburger shrieked, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, how terrible!\xe2\x80\x9d when she\nsaw that she had left a chemise of sheer lavender cr\xc3\xaape on the bed. She\ntucked it into a bag, while Babbitt giggled, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mind us; we\xe2\x80\x99re a\ncouple o\xe2\x80\x99 little divvils!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSassburger telephoned for ice, and the bell-boy who brought it said,\nprosaically and unprompted, \xe2\x80\x9cHighball glasses or cocktail?\xe2\x80\x9d Miriam\nSassburger mixed the cocktails in one of those dismal, nakedly white\nwater-pitchers which exist only in hotels. When they had finished the\nfirst round she proved by intoning \xe2\x80\x9cThink you boys could stand\nanother--you got a dividend coming\xe2\x80\x9d that, though she was but a woman,\nshe knew the complete and perfect rite of cocktail-drinking.\n\nOutside, Babbitt hinted to Rogers, \xe2\x80\x9cSay, W. A., old rooster, it comes\nover me that I could stand it if we didn\xe2\x80\x99t go back to the lovin\xe2\x80\x99 wives,\nthis handsome _Abend_, but just kind of stayed in Monarch and threw a\nparty, heh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge, you speak with the tongue of wisdom and sagashiteriferousness.\nEl Wing\xe2\x80\x99s wife has gone on to Pittsburg. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see if we can\xe2\x80\x99t gather\nhim in.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt half-past seven they sat in their room, with Elbert Wing and two\nup-state delegates. Their coats were off, their vests open, their faces\nred, their voices emphatic. They were finishing a bottle of corrosive\nbootlegged whisky and imploring the bell-boy, \xe2\x80\x9cSay, son, can you get us\nsome more of this embalming fluid?\xe2\x80\x9d They were smoking large cigars and\ndropping ashes and stubs on the carpet. With windy guffaws they were\ntelling stories. They were, in fact, males in a happy state of nature.\n\nBabbitt sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it strikes you hellions, but\npersonally I like this busting loose for a change, and kicking over a\ncouple of mountains and climbing up on the North Pole and waving the\naurora borealis around.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe man from Sparta, a grave, intense youngster, babbled, \xe2\x80\x9cSay! I guess\nI\xe2\x80\x99m as good a husband as the run of the mill, but God, I do get so tired\nof going home every evening, and nothing to see but the movies. That\xe2\x80\x99s\nwhy I go out and drill with the National Guard. I guess I got the\nnicest little wife in my burg, but-- Say! Know what I wanted to do as a\nkid? Know what I wanted to do? Wanted to be a big chemist. Tha\xe2\x80\x99s what I\nwanted to do. But Dad chased me out on the road selling kitchenware, and\nhere I\xe2\x80\x99m settled down--settled for _life_--not a chance! Oh, who the\ndevil started this funeral talk? How \xe2\x80\x99bout \xe2\x80\x99nother lil drink? \xe2\x80\x98And\na-noth-er drink wouldn\xe2\x80\x99 do \xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99ny harmmmmmmm.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea. Cut the sob-stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d said W. A. Rogers genially. \xe2\x80\x9cYou boys know I\xe2\x80\x99m\nthe village songster? Come on now--sing up:\n\n    Said the old Obadiah to the young Obadiah,\n    \xe2\x80\x98I am dry, Obadiah, I am dry.\xe2\x80\x99\n    Said the young Obadiah to the old Obadiah,\n    \xe2\x80\x98So am I, Obadiah, so am I.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nX\n\nThey had dinner in the Moorish Grillroom of the Hotel Sedgwick.\nSomewhere, somehow, they seemed to have gathered in two other comrades:\na manufacturer of fly-paper and a dentist. They all drank whisky from\ntea-cups, and they were humorous, and never listened to one another,\nexcept when W. A. Rogers \xe2\x80\x9ckidded\xe2\x80\x9d the Italian waiter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Gooseppy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said innocently, \xe2\x80\x9cI want a couple o\xe2\x80\x99 fried\nelephants\xe2\x80\x99 ears.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSorry, sir, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t any.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh? No elephants\xe2\x80\x99 ears? What do you know about that!\xe2\x80\x9d Rogers turned to\nBabbitt. \xe2\x80\x9cPedro says the elephants\xe2\x80\x99 ears are all out!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be switched!\xe2\x80\x9d said the man from Sparta, with difficulty\nhiding his laughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, in that case, Carlo, just bring me a hunk o\xe2\x80\x99 steak and a couple\no\xe2\x80\x99 bushels o\xe2\x80\x99 French fried potatoes and some peas,\xe2\x80\x9d Rogers went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nsuppose back in dear old sunny It\xe2\x80\x99 the Eyetalians get their fresh\ngarden peas out of the can.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, we have very nice peas in Italy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that a fact! Georgie, do you hear that? They get their fresh garden\npeas out of the garden, in Italy! By golly, you live and learn, don\xe2\x80\x99t\nyou, Antonio, you certainly do live and learn, if you live long enough\nand keep your strength. All right, Garibaldi, just shoot me in that\nsteak, with about two printers\xe2\x80\x99-reams of French fried spuds on the\npromenade deck, _comprehenez-vous_, Michelovitch Angeloni?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfterward Elbert Wing admired, \xe2\x80\x9cGee, you certainly did have that poor\nDago going, W. A. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make you out at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the _Monarch Herald_, Babbitt found an advertisement which he read\naloud, to applause and laughter:\n\n                          Old Colony Theatre\n\n                       Shake the Old Dogs to the\n                           WROLLICKING WRENS\n                    The bonniest bevy of beauteous\n                      bathing babes in burlesque.\n                         Pete Menutti and his\n                            Oh, Gee, Kids.\n\n     This is the straight steer, Benny, the painless chicklets of the\n     Wrollicking Wrens are the cuddlingest bunch that ever hit town.\n     Steer the feet, get the card board, and twist the pupils to the\n     PDQest show ever. You will get 111% on your kale in this fun-fest.\n     The Calroza Sisters are sure some lookers and will give you a run\n     for your gelt. Jock Silbersteen is one of the pepper lads and slips\n     you a dose of real laughter. Shoot the up and down to Jackson and\n     West for graceful tappers. They run 1-2 under the wire. Provin and\n     Adams will blow the blues in their laugh skit \xe2\x80\x9cHootch Mon!\xe2\x80\x9d\n     Something doing, boys. Listen to what the Hep Bird twitters.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSounds like a juicy show to me. Let\xe2\x80\x99s all take it in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Babbitt.\n\nBut they put off departure as long as they could. They were safe while\nthey sat here, legs firmly crossed under the table, but they felt\nunsteady; they were afraid of navigating the long and slippery floor of\nthe grillroom under the eyes of the other guests and the too-attentive\nwaiters.\n\nWhen they did venture, tables got in their way, and they sought to cover\nembarrassment by heavy jocularity at the coatroom. As the girl handed\nout their hats, they smiled at her, and hoped that she, a cool and\nexpert judge, would feel that they were gentlemen. They croaked at one\nanother, \xe2\x80\x9cWho owns the bum lid?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cYou take a good one, George; I\xe2\x80\x99ll\ntake what\xe2\x80\x99s left,\xe2\x80\x9d and to the check-girl they stammered, \xe2\x80\x9cBetter come\nalong, sister! High, wide, and fancy evening ahead!\xe2\x80\x9d All of them tried\nto tip her, urging one another, \xe2\x80\x9cNo! Wait! Here! I got it right here!\xe2\x80\x9d\nAmong them, they gave her three dollars.\n\n\nXI\n\nFlamboyantly smoking cigars they sat in a box at the burlesque show,\ntheir feet up on the rail, while a chorus of twenty daubed, worried, and\ninextinguishably respectable grandams swung their legs in the more\nelementary chorus-evolutions, and a Jewish comedian made vicious fun of\nJews. In the entr\xe2\x80\x99actes they met other lone delegates. A dozen of them\nwent in taxicabs out to Bright Blossom Inn, where the blossoms were made\nof dusty paper festooned along a room low and stinking, like a\ncow-stable no longer wisely used.\n\nHere, whisky was served openly, in glasses. Two or three clerks, who on\npay-day longed to be taken for millionaires, sheepishly danced with\ntelephone-girls and manicure-girls in the narrow space between the\ntables. Fantastically whirled the professionals, a young man in sleek\nevening-clothes and a slim mad girl in emerald silk, with amber hair\nflung up as jaggedly as flames. Babbitt tried to dance with her. He\nshuffled along the floor, too bulky to be guided, his steps unrelated to\nthe rhythm of the jungle music, and in his staggering he would have\nfallen, had she not held him with supple kindly strength. He was blind\nand deaf from prohibition-era alcohol; he could not see the tables, the\nfaces. But he was overwhelmed by the girl and her young pliant warmth.\n\nWhen she had firmly returned him to his group, he remembered, by a\nconnection quite untraceable, that his mother\xe2\x80\x99s mother had been Scotch,\nand with head thrown back, eyes closed, wide mouth indicating ecstasy,\nhe sang, very slowly and richly, \xe2\x80\x9cLoch Lomond.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut that was the last of his mellowness and jolly companionship. The man\nfrom Sparta said he was a \xe2\x80\x9cbum singer,\xe2\x80\x9d and for ten minutes Babbitt\nquarreled with him, in a loud, unsteady, heroic indignation. They called\nfor drinks till the manager insisted that the place was closed. All the\nwhile Babbitt felt a hot raw desire for more brutal amusements. When W.\nA. Rogers drawled, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat say we go down the line and look over the\ngirls?\xe2\x80\x9d he agreed savagely. Before they went, three of them secretly\nmade appointments with the professional dancing girl, who agreed \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\nyes, sure, darling\xe2\x80\x9d to everything they said, and amiably forgot them.\n\nAs they drove back through the outskirts of Monarch, down streets of\nsmall brown wooden cottages of workmen, characterless as cells, as they\nrattled across warehouse-districts which by drunken night seemed vast\nand perilous, as they were borne toward the red lights and violent\nautomatic pianos and the stocky women who simpered, Babbitt was\nfrightened. He wanted to leap from the taxicab, but all his body was a\nmurky fire, and he groaned, \xe2\x80\x9cToo late to quit now,\xe2\x80\x9d and knew that he did\nnot want to quit.\n\nThere was, they felt, one very humorous incident on the way. A broker\nfrom Minnemagantic said, \xe2\x80\x9cMonarch is a lot sportier than Zenith. You\nZenith tightwads haven\xe2\x80\x99t got any joints like these here.\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt raged,\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a dirty lie! Snothin\xe2\x80\x99 you can\xe2\x80\x99t find in Zenith. Believe me, we\ngot more houses and hootch-parlors an\xe2\x80\x99 all kinds o\xe2\x80\x99 dives than any burg\nin the state.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe realized they were laughing at him; he desired to fight; and forgot\nit in such musty unsatisfying experiments as he had not known since\ncollege.\n\nIn the morning, when he returned to Zenith, his desire for rebellion was\npartly satisfied. He had retrograded to a shame-faced contentment. He\nwas irritable. He did not smile when W. A. Rogers complained, \xe2\x80\x9cOw, what\na head! I certainly do feel like the wrath of God this morning. Say! I\nknow what was the trouble! Somebody went and put alcohol in my booze\nlast night.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt\xe2\x80\x99s excursion was never known to his family, nor to any one in\nZenith save Rogers and Wing. It was not officially recognized even by\nhimself. If it had any consequences, they have not been discovered.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nI\n\nThis autumn a Mr. W. G. Harding, of Marion, Ohio, was appointed\nPresident of the United States, but Zenith was less interested in the\nnational campaign than in the local election. Seneca Doane, though he\nwas a lawyer and a graduate of the State University, was candidate for\nmayor of Zenith on an alarming labor ticket. To oppose him the Democrats\nand Republicans united on Lucas Prout, a mattress-manufacturer with a\nperfect record for sanity. Mr. Prout was supported by the banks, the\nChamber of Commerce, all the decent newspapers, and George F. Babbitt.\n\nBabbitt was precinct-leader on Floral Heights, but his district was safe\nand he longed for stouter battling. His convention paper had given him\nthe beginning of a reputation for oratory, so the Republican-Democratic\nCentral Committee sent him to the Seventh Ward and South Zenith, to\naddress small audiences of workmen and clerks, and wives uneasy with\ntheir new votes. He acquired a fame enduring for weeks. Now and then a\nreporter was present at one of his meetings, and the headlines (though\nthey were not very large) indicated that George F. Babbitt had addressed\nCheering Throng, and Distinguished Man of Affairs had pointed out the\nFallacies of Doane. Once, in the rotogravure section of the Sunday\n_Advocate-Times_, there was a photograph of Babbitt and a dozen other\nbusiness men, with the caption \xe2\x80\x9cLeaders of Zenith Finance and Commerce\nWho Back Prout.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe deserved his glory. He was an excellent campaigner. He had faith; he\nwas certain that if Lincoln were alive, he would be electioneering for\nMr. W. G. Harding--unless he came to Zenith and electioneered for Lucas\nProut. He did not confuse audiences by silly subtleties; Prout\nrepresented honest industry, Seneca Doane represented whining laziness,\nand you could take your choice. With his broad shoulders and vigorous\nvoice, he was obviously a Good Fellow; and, rarest of all, he really\nliked people. He almost liked common workmen. He wanted them to be well\npaid, and able to afford high rents--though, naturally, they must not\ninterfere with the reasonable profits of stockholders. Thus nobly\nendowed, and keyed high by the discovery that he was a natural orator,\nhe was popular with audiences, and he raged through the campaign,\nrenowned not only in the Seventh and Eighth Wards but even in parts of\nthe Sixteenth.\n\n\nII\n\nCrowded in his car, they came driving up to Turnverein Hall, South\nZenith-- Babbitt, his wife, Verona, Ted, and Paul and Zilla Riesling. The\nhall was over a delicatessen shop, in a street banging with trolleys and\nsmelling of onions and gasoline and fried fish. A new appreciation of\nBabbitt filled all of them, including Babbitt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t know how you keep it up, talking to three bunches in one evening.\nWish I had your strength,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul; and Ted exclaimed to Verona, \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nold man certainly does know how to kid these roughnecks along!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMen in black sateen shirts, their faces new-washed but with a hint of\ngrime under their eyes, were loitering on the broad stairs up to the\nhall. Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s party politely edged through them and into the\nwhitewashed room, at the front of which was a dais with a red-plush\nthrone and a pine altar painted watery blue, as used nightly by the\nGrand Masters and Supreme Potentates of innumerable lodges. The hall was\nfull. As Babbitt pushed through the fringe standing at the back, he\nheard the precious tribute, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s him!\xe2\x80\x9d The chairman bustled down the\ncenter aisle with an impressive, \xe2\x80\x9cThe speaker? All ready, sir! Uh--let\xe2\x80\x99s\nsee--what was the name, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen Babbitt slid into a sea of eloquence:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLadies and gentlemen of the Sixteenth Ward, there is one who cannot be\nwith us here to-night, a man than whom there is no more stalwart Trojan\nin all the political arena-- I refer to our leader, the Honorable Lucas\nProut, standard-bearer of the city and county of Zenith. Since he is not\nhere, I trust that you will bear with me if, as a friend and neighbor,\nas one who is proud to share with you the common blessing of being a\nresident of the great city of Zenith, I tell you in all candor, honesty,\nand sincerity how the issues of this critical campaign appear to one\nplain man of business--to one who, brought up to the blessings of\npoverty and of manual labor, has, even when Fate condemned him to sit at\na desk, yet never forgotten how it feels, by heck, to be up at\nfive-thirty and at the factory with the ole dinner-pail in his hardened\nmitt when the whistle blew at seven, unless the owner sneaked in ten\nminutes on us and blew it early! (Laughter.) To come down to the basic\nand fundamental issues of this campaign, the great error, insincerely\npromulgated by Seneca Doane--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere were workmen who jeered--young cynical workmen, for the most part\nforeigners, Jews, Swedes, Irishmen, Italians--but the older men, the\npatient, bleached, stooped carpenters and mechanics, cheered him; and\nwhen he worked up to his anecdote of Lincoln their eyes were wet.\n\nModestly, busily, he hurried out of the hall on delicious applause, and\nsped off to his third audience of the evening. \xe2\x80\x9cTed, you better drive,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cKind of all in after that spiel. Well, Paul, how\xe2\x80\x99d it go? Did\nI get \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBully! Corking! You had a lot of pep.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMrs. Babbitt worshiped, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it was fine! So clear and interesting, and\nsuch nice ideas. When I hear you orating I realize I don\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate\nhow profoundly you think and what a splendid brain and vocabulary you\nhave. Just--splendid.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut Verona was irritating. \xe2\x80\x9cDad,\xe2\x80\x9d she worried, \xe2\x80\x9chow do you know that\npublic ownership of utilities and so on and so forth will always be a\nfailure?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMrs. Babbitt reproved, \xe2\x80\x9cRone, I should think you could see and realize\nthat when your father\xe2\x80\x99s all worn out with orating, it\xe2\x80\x99s no time to\nexpect him to explain these complicated subjects. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure when he\xe2\x80\x99s\nrested he\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad to explain it to you. Now let\xe2\x80\x99s all be quiet and\ngive Papa a chance to get ready for his next speech. Just think! Right\nnow they\xe2\x80\x99re gathering in Maccabee Temple, and _waiting_ for us!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nIII\n\nMr. Lucas Prout and Sound Business defeated Mr. Seneca Doane and Class\nRule, and Zenith was again saved. Babbitt was offered several minor\nappointments to distribute among poor relations, but he preferred\nadvance information about the extension of paved highways, and this a\ngrateful administration gave to him. Also, he was one of only nineteen\nspeakers at the dinner with which the Chamber of Commerce celebrated the\nvictory of righteousness.\n\nHis reputation for oratory established, at the dinner of the Zenith Real\nEstate Board he made the Annual Address. The _Advocate-Times_ reported\nthis speech with unusual fullness:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the livest banquets that has recently been pulled off occurred\nlast night in the annual Get-Together Fest of the Zenith Real Estate\nBoard, held in the Venetian Ball Room of the O\xe2\x80\x99Hearn House. Mine host\nGil O\xe2\x80\x99Hearn had as usual done himself proud and those assembled feasted\non such an assemblage of plates as could be rivaled nowhere west of New\nYork, if there, and washed down the plenteous feed with the cup which\ninspired but did not inebriate in the shape of cider from the farm of\nChandler Mott, president of the board and who acted as witty and\nefficient chairman.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs Mr. Mott was suffering from slight infection and sore throat, G. F.\nBabbitt made the principal talk. Besides outlining the progress of\nTorrensing real estate titles, Mr. Babbitt spoke in part as follows:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98In rising to address you, with my impromptu speech carefully tucked\ninto my vest pocket, I am reminded of the story of the two Irishmen,\nMike and Pat, who were riding on the Pullman. Both of them, I forgot to\nsay, were sailors in the Navy. It seems Mike had the lower berth and by\nand by he heard a terrible racket from the upper, and when he yelled up\nto find out what the trouble was, Pat answered, \xe2\x80\x9cShure an\xe2\x80\x99 bedad an\xe2\x80\x99 how\ncan I ever get a night\xe2\x80\x99s sleep at all, at all? I been trying to get into\nthis darned little hammock ever since eight bells!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Now, gentlemen, standing up here before you, I feel a good deal like\nPat, and maybe after I\xe2\x80\x99ve spieled along for a while, I may feel so darn\nsmall that I\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to crawl into a Pullman hammock with no trouble\nat all, at all!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen, it strikes me that each year at this annual occasion when\nfriend and foe get together and lay down the battle-ax and let the waves\nof good-fellowship waft them up the flowery slopes of amity, it behooves\nus, standing together eye to eye and shoulder to shoulder as\nfellow-citizens of the best city in the world, to consider where we are\nboth as regards ourselves and the common weal.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It is true that even with our 361,000, or practically 362,000,\npopulation, there are, by the last census, almost a score of larger\ncities in the United States. But, gentlemen, if by the next census we do\nnot stand at least tenth, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll be the first to request any knocker\nto remove my shirt and to eat the same, with the compliments of G. F.\nBabbitt, Esquire! It may be true that New York, Chicago, and\nPhiladelphia will continue to keep ahead of us in size. But aside from\nthese three cities, which are notoriously so overgrown that no decent\nwhite man, nobody who loves his wife and kiddies and God\xe2\x80\x99s good\nout-o\xe2\x80\x99-doors and likes to shake the hand of his neighbor in greeting,\nwould want to live in them--and let me tell you right here and now, I\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t trade a high-class Zenith acreage development for the whole\nlength and breadth of Broadway or State Street!--aside from these three,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s evident to any one with a head for facts that Zenith is the finest\nexample of American life and prosperity to be found anywhere.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say we\xe2\x80\x99re perfect. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot to do in the way of\nextending the paving of motor boulevards, for, believe me, it\xe2\x80\x99s the\nfellow with four to ten thousand a year, say, and an automobile and a\nnice little family in a bungalow on the edge of town, that makes the\nwheels of progress go round!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the type of fellow that\xe2\x80\x99s ruling America to-day; in fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s\nthe ideal type to which the entire world must tend, if there\xe2\x80\x99s to be a\ndecent, well-balanced, Christian, go-ahead future for this little old\nplanet! Once in a while I just naturally sit back and size up this Solid\nAmerican Citizen, with a whale of a lot of satisfaction.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Our Ideal Citizen-- I picture him first and foremost as being busier\nthan a bird-dog, not wasting a lot of good time in day-dreaming or going\nto sassiety teas or kicking about things that are none of his business,\nbut putting the zip into some store or profession or art. At night he\nlights up a good cigar, and climbs into the little old \xe2\x80\x99bus, and maybe\ncusses the carburetor, and shoots out home. He mows the lawn, or sneaks\nin some practice putting, and then he\xe2\x80\x99s ready for dinner. After dinner\nhe tells the kiddies a story, or takes the family to the movies, or\nplays a few fists of bridge, or reads the evening paper, and a chapter\nor two of some good lively Western novel if he has a taste for\nliterature, and maybe the folks next-door drop in and they sit and visit\nabout their friends and the topics of the day. Then he goes happily to\nbed, his conscience clear, having contributed his mite to the\nprosperity of the city and to his own bank-account.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98In politics and religion this Sane Citizen is the canniest man on\nearth; and in the arts he invariably has a natural taste which makes him\npick out the best, every time. In no country in the world will you find\nso many reproductions of the Old Masters and of well-known paintings on\nparlor walls as in these United States. No country has anything like our\nnumber of phonographs, with not only dance records and comic but also\nthe best operas, such as Verdi, rendered by the world\xe2\x80\x99s highest-paid\nsingers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98In other countries, art and literature are left to a lot of shabby\nbums living in attics and feeding on booze and spaghetti, but in America\nthe successful writer or picture-painter is indistinguishable from any\nother decent business man; and I, for one, am only too glad that the man\nwho has the rare skill to season his message with interesting reading\nmatter and who shows both purpose and pep in handling his literary wares\nhas a chance to drag down his fifty thousand bucks a year, to mingle\nwith the biggest executives on terms of perfect equality, and to show as\nbig a house and as swell a car as any Captain of Industry! But, mind\nyou, it\xe2\x80\x99s the appreciation of the Regular Guy who I have been depicting\nwhich has made this possible, and you got to hand as much credit to him\nas to the authors themselves.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Finally, but most important, our Standardized Citizen, even if he is a\nbachelor, is a lover of the Little Ones, a supporter of the hearthstone\nwhich is the basic foundation of our civilization, first, last, and all\nthe time, and the thing that most distinguishes us from the decayed\nnations of Europe.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I have never yet toured Europe--and as a matter of fact, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\nthat I care to such an awful lot, as long as there\xe2\x80\x99s our own mighty\ncities and mountains to be seen--but, the way I figure it out, there\nmust be a good many of our own sort of folks abroad. Indeed, one of the\nmost enthusiastic Rotarians I ever met boosted the tenets of\none-hundred-per-cent pep in a burr that smacked o\xe2\x80\x99 bonny Scutlond and\nall ye bonny braes o\xe2\x80\x99 Bobby Burns. But same time, one thing that\ndistinguishes us from our good brothers, the hustlers over there, is\nthat they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to take a lot off the snobs and journalists and\npoliticians, while the modern American business man knows how to talk\nright up for himself, knows how to make it good and plenty clear that he\nintends to run the works. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to call in some highbrow\nhired-man when it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary for him to answer the crooked critics of\nthe sane and efficient life. He\xe2\x80\x99s not dumb, like the old-fashioned\nmerchant. He\xe2\x80\x99s got a vocabulary and a punch.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98With all modesty, I want to stand up here as a representative business\nman and gently whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s our kind of folks! Here\xe2\x80\x99s the\nspecifications of the Standardized American Citizen! Here\xe2\x80\x99s the new\ngeneration of Americans: fellows with hair on their chests and smiles in\ntheir eyes and adding-machines in their offices. We\xe2\x80\x99re not doing any\nboasting, but we like ourselves first-rate, and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like us,\nlook out--better get under cover before the cyclone hits town!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98So! In my clumsy way I have tried to sketch the Real He-man, the\nfellow with Zip and Bang. And it\xe2\x80\x99s because Zenith has so large a\nproportion of such men that it\xe2\x80\x99s the most stable, the greatest of our\ncities. New York also has its thousands of Real Folks, but New York is\ncursed with unnumbered foreigners. So are Chicago and San Francisco. Oh,\nwe have a golden roster of cities--Detroit and Cleveland with their\nrenowned factories, Cincinnati with its great machine-tool and soap\nproducts, Pittsburg and Birmingham with their steel, Kansas City and\nMinneapolis and Omaha that open their bountiful gates on the bosom of\nthe ocean-like wheatlands, and countless other magnificent\nsister-cities, for, by the last census, there were no less than\nsixty-eight glorious American burgs with a population of over one\nhundred thousand! And all these cities stand together for power and\npurity, and against foreign ideas and communism--Atlanta with Hartford,\nRochester with Denver, Milwaukee with Indianapolis, Los Angeles with\nScranton, Portland, Maine, with Portland, Oregon. A good live wire from\nBaltimore or Seattle or Duluth is the twin-brother of every like fellow\nbooster from Buffalo or Akron, Fort Worth or Oskaloosa!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98But it\xe2\x80\x99s here in Zenith, the home for manly men and womanly women and\nbright kids, that you find the largest proportion of these Regular Guys,\nand that\xe2\x80\x99s what sets it in a class by itself; that\xe2\x80\x99s why Zenith will be\nremembered in history as having set the pace for a civilization that\nshall endure when the old time-killing ways are gone forever and the day\nof earnest efficient endeavor shall have dawned all round the world!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Some time I hope folks will quit handing all the credit to a lot of\nmoth-eaten, mildewed, out-of-date, old, European dumps, and give proper\ncredit to the famous Zenith spirit, that clean fighting determination to\nwin Success that has made the little old Zip City celebrated in every\nland and clime, wherever condensed milk and pasteboard cartons are\nknown! Believe me, the world has fallen too long for these worn-out\ncountries that aren\xe2\x80\x99t producing anything but bootblacks and scenery and\nbooze, that haven\xe2\x80\x99t got one bathroom per hundred people, and that don\xe2\x80\x99t\nknow a loose-leaf ledger from a slip-cover; and it\xe2\x80\x99s just about time for\nsome Zenithite to get his back up and holler for a show-down!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I tell you, Zenith and her sister-cities are producing a new type of\ncivilization. There are many resemblances between Zenith and these other\nburgs, and I\xe2\x80\x99m darn glad of it! The extraordinary, growing, and sane\nstandardization of stores, offices, streets, hotels, clothes, and\nnewspapers throughout the United States shows how strong and enduring a\ntype is ours.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I always like to remember a piece that Chum Frink wrote for the\nnewspapers about his lecture-tours. It is doubtless familiar to many of\nyou, but if you will permit me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a chance and read it. It\xe2\x80\x99s\none of the classic poems, like \xe2\x80\x9cIf\xe2\x80\x9d by Kipling, or Ella Wheeler Wilcox\xe2\x80\x99s\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Man Worth While\xe2\x80\x9d; and I always carry this clipping of it in my\nnote-book:\n\n     _When I am out upon the road, a poet with a pedler\xe2\x80\x99s load, I mostly\n     sing a hearty song, and take a chew and hike along, a-handing out\n     my samples fine of Cheero Brand of sweet sun-shine, and peddling\n     optimistic pokes and stable lines of japes and jokes to Lyceums and\n     other folks, to Rotarys, Kiwanis\xe2\x80\x99 Clubs, and feel I ain\xe2\x80\x99t like\n     other dubs. And then old Major Silas Satan, a brainy cuss who\xe2\x80\x99s\n     always waitin\xe2\x80\x99, he gives his tail a lively quirk, and gets in quick\n     his dirty work. He fills me up with mullygrubs; my hair the\n     backward way he rubs; he makes me lonelier than a hound, on Sunday\n     when the folks ain\xe2\x80\x99t round. And then b\xe2\x80\x99gosh, I would prefer to\n     never be a lecturer, a-ridin\xe2\x80\x99 round in classy cars and smoking\n     fifty-cent cigars, and never more I want to roam; I simply want to\n     be back home, a-eatin\xe2\x80\x99 flap-jacks, hash, and ham, with folks who\n     savvy whom I am!_\n\n     _But when I get that lonely spell, I simply seek the best hotel, no\n     matter in what town I be--St. Paul, Toledo, or K.C., in Washington,\n     Schenectady, in Louisville or Albany. And at that inn it hits my\n     dome that I again am right at home. If I should stand a lengthy\n     spell in front of that first-class hotel, that to the drummers\n     loves to cater, across from some big film theayter; if I should\n     look around and buzz, and wonder in what town I was, I swear that I\n     could never tell! For all the crowd would be so swell, in just the\n     same fine sort of jeans they wear at home, and all the queens with\n     spiffy bonnets on their beans, and all the fellows standing round\n     a-talkin\xe2\x80\x99 always, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound, the same good jolly kind of guff,\n     \xe2\x80\x99bout autos, politics and stuff and baseball players of renown that\n     Nice Guys talk in my home town!_\n\n     _Then when I entered that hotel, I\xe2\x80\x99d look around and say, \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\n     well!\xe2\x80\x9d For there would be the same news-stand, same_ _magazines\n     and candies grand, same smokes of famous standard brand, I\xe2\x80\x99d find\n     at home, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell! And when I saw the jolly bunch come waltzing in\n     for eats at lunch, and squaring up in natty duds to platters large\n     of French Fried spuds, why then I\xe2\x80\x99d stand right up and bawl, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\n     never left my home at all!\xe2\x80\x9d And all replete I\xe2\x80\x99d sit me down beside\n     some guy in derby brown upon a lobby chair of plush, and murmur to\n     him in a rush, \xe2\x80\x9cHello, Bill, tell me, good old scout, how is your\n     stock a-holdin\xe2\x80\x99 out?\xe2\x80\x9d Then we\xe2\x80\x99d be off, two solid pals,\n     a-chatterin\xe2\x80\x99 like giddy gals of flivvers, weather, home, and wives,\n     lodge-brothers then for all our lives! So when Sam Satan makes you\n     blue, good friend, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99d up and do, for in these States\n     where\xe2\x80\x99er you roam, you never leave your home sweet home._\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir, these other burgs are our true partners in the great game of\nvital living. But let\xe2\x80\x99s not have any mistake about this. I claim that\nZenith is the best partner and the fastest-growing partner of the whole\ncaboodle. I trust I may be pardoned if I give a few statistics to back\nup my claims. If they are old stuff to any of you, yet the tidings of\nprosperity, like the good news of the Bible, never become tedious to the\nears of a real hustler, no matter how oft the sweet story is told! Every\nintelligent person knows that Zenith manufactures more condensed milk\nand evaporated cream, more paper boxes, and more lighting-fixtures, than\nany other city in the United States, if not in the world. But it is not\nso universally known that we also stand second in the manufacture of\npackage-butter, sixth in the giant realm of motors and automobiles, and\nsomewhere about third in cheese, leather findings, tar roofing,\nbreakfast food, and overalls!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Our greatness, however, lies not alone in punchful prosperity but\nequally in that public spirit, that forward-looking idealism and\nbrotherhood, which has marked Zenith ever since its foundation by the\nFathers. We have a right, indeed we have a duty toward our fair city, to\nannounce broadcast the facts about our high schools, characterized by\ntheir complete plants and the finest school-ventilating systems in the\ncountry, bar none; our magnificent new hotels and banks and the\npaintings and carved marble in their lobbies; and the Second National\nTower, the second highest business building in any inland city in the\nentire country. When I add that we have an unparalleled number of miles\nof paved streets, bathrooms, vacuum cleaners, and all the other signs of\ncivilization; that our library and art museum are well supported and\nhoused in convenient and roomy buildings; that our park-system is more\nthan up to par, with its handsome driveways adorned with grass, shrubs,\nand statuary, then I give but a hint of the all-round unlimited\ngreatness of Zenith!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I believe, however, in keeping the best to the last. When I remind you\nthat we have one motor car for every five and seven-eighths persons in\nthe city, then I give a rock-ribbed practical indication of the kind of\nprogress and braininess which is synonymous with the name Zenith!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98But the way of the righteous is not all roses. Before I close I must\ncall your attention to a problem we have to face, this coming year. The\nworst menace to sound government is not the avowed socialists but a lot\nof cowards who work under cover--the long-haired gentry who call\nthemselves \xe2\x80\x9cliberals\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cradicals\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnon-partisan\xe2\x80\x9d and\n\xe2\x80\x9cintelligentsia\xe2\x80\x9d and God only knows how many other trick names!\nIrresponsible teachers and professors constitute the worst of this whole\ngang, and I am ashamed to say that several of them are on the faculty of\nour great State University! The U. is my own Alma Mater, and I am proud\nto be known as an alumni, but there are certain instructors there who\nseem to think we ought to turn the conduct of the nation over to hoboes\nand roustabouts.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Those profs are the snakes to be scotched--they and all their\nmilk-and-water ilk! The American business man is generous to a fault,\nbut one thing he does demand of all teachers and lecturers and\njournalists: if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to pay them our good money, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\nhelp us by selling efficiency and whooping it up for rational\nprosperity! And when it comes to these blab-mouth, fault-finding,\npessimistic, cynical University teachers, let me tell you that during\nthis golden coming year it\xe2\x80\x99s just as much our duty to bring influence to\nhave those cusses fired as it is to sell all the real estate and gather\nin all the good shekels we can.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Not till that is done will our sons and daughters see that the ideal\nof American manhood and culture isn\xe2\x80\x99t a lot of cranks sitting around\nchewing the rag about their Rights and their Wrongs, but a God-fearing,\nhustling, successful, two-fisted Regular Guy, who belongs to some church\nwith pep and piety to it, who belongs to the Boosters or the Rotarians\nor the Kiwanis, to the Elks or Moose or Red Men or Knights of Columbus\nor any one of a score of organizations of good, jolly, kidding,\nlaughing, sweating, upstanding, lend-a-handing Royal Good Fellows, who\nplays hard and works hard, and whose answer to his critics is a\nsquare-toed boot that\xe2\x80\x99ll teach the grouches and smart alecks to respect\nthe He-man and get out and root for Uncle Samuel, U.S.A.!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nIV\n\nBabbitt promised to become a recognized orator. He entertained a Smoker\nof the Men\xe2\x80\x99s Club of the Chatham Road Presbyterian Church with Irish,\nJewish, and Chinese dialect stories.\n\nBut in nothing was he more clearly revealed as the Prominent Citizen\nthan in his lecture on \xe2\x80\x9cBrass Tacks Facts on Real Estate,\xe2\x80\x9d as delivered\nbefore the class in Sales Methods at the Zenith Y.M.C.A.\n\nThe _Advocate-Times_ reported the lecture so fully that Vergil Gunch\nsaid to Babbitt, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re getting to be one of the classiest spellbinders\nin town. Seems \xe2\x80\x99s if I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pick up a paper without reading about\nyour well-known eloquence. All this guff ought to bring a lot of\nbusiness into your office. Good work! Keep it up!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, quit your kidding,\xe2\x80\x9d said Babbitt feebly, but at this tribute\nfrom Gunch, himself a man of no mean oratorical fame, he expanded with\ndelight and wondered how, before his vacation, he could have questioned\nthe joys of being a solid citizen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nI\n\nHis march to greatness was not without disastrous stumbling.\n\nFame did not bring the social advancement which the Babbitts deserved.\nThey were not asked to join the Tonawanda Country Club nor invited to\nthe dances at the Union. Himself, Babbitt fretted, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9ccare a fat\nhoot for all these highrollers, but the wife would kind of like to be\nAmong Those Present.\xe2\x80\x9d He nervously awaited his university class-dinner\nand an evening of furious intimacy with such social leaders as Charles\nMcKelvey the millionaire contractor, Max Kruger the banker, Irving Tate\nthe tool-manufacturer, and Adelbert Dobson the fashionable interior\ndecorator. Theoretically he was their friend, as he had been in college,\nand when he encountered them they still called him \xe2\x80\x9cGeorgie,\xe2\x80\x9d but he\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to encounter them often, and they never invited him to\ndinner (with champagne and a butler) at their houses on Royal Ridge.\n\nAll the week before the class-dinner he thought of them. \xe2\x80\x9cNo reason why\nwe shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t become real chummy now!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nII\n\nLike all true American diversions and spiritual outpourings, the dinner\nof the men of the Class of 1896 was thoroughly organized. The\ndinner-committee hammered like a sales-corporation. Once a week they\nsent out reminders:\n\n                             TICKLER NO. 3\n\n     Old man, are you going to be with us at the livest Friendship Feed\n     the alumni of the good old U have ever known? The alumn\xc3\xa6 of \xe2\x80\x9908\n     turned out 60% strong. Are we boys going to be beaten by a bunch of\n     skirts? Come on, fellows, let\xe2\x80\x99s work up some real genuine\n     enthusiasm and all boost together for the snappiest dinner yet!\n     Elegant eats, short ginger-talks, and memories shared together of\n     the brightest, gladdest days of life.\n\nThe dinner was held in a private room at the Union Club. The club was a\ndingy building, three pretentious old dwellings knocked together, and\nthe entrance-hall resembled a potato cellar, yet the Babbitt who was\nfree of the magnificence of the Athletic Club entered with\nembarrassment. He nodded to the doorman, an ancient proud negro with\nbrass buttons and a blue tail-coat, and paraded through the hall, trying\nto look like a member.\n\nSixty men had come to the dinner. They made islands and eddies in the\nhall; they packed the elevator and the corners of the private\ndining-room. They tried to be intimate and enthusiastic. They appeared\nto one another exactly as they had in college--as raw youngsters whose\npresent mustaches, baldnesses, paunches, and wrinkles were but jovial\ndisguises put on for the evening. \xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed a particle!\xe2\x80\x9d they\nmarveled. The men whom they could not recall they addressed, \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\nwell, great to see you again, old man. What are you-- Still doing the\nsame thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSome one was always starting a cheer or a college song, and it was\nalways thinning into silence. Despite their resolution to be democratic\nthey divided into two sets: the men with dress-clothes and the men\nwithout. Babbitt (extremely in dress-clothes) went from one group to the\nother. Though he was, almost frankly, out for social conquest, he sought\nPaul Riesling first. He found him alone, neat and silent.\n\nPaul sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m no good at this handshaking and \xe2\x80\x98well, look who\xe2\x80\x99s\nhere\xe2\x80\x99 bunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRats now, Paulibus, loosen up and be a mixer! Finest bunch of boys on\nearth! Say, you seem kind of glum. What\xe2\x80\x99s matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the usual. Run-in with Zilla.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on! Let\xe2\x80\x99s wade in and forget our troubles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe kept Paul beside him, but worked toward the spot where Charles\nMcKelvey stood warming his admirers like a furnace.\n\nMcKelvey had been the hero of the Class of \xe2\x80\x9996; not only football\ncaptain and hammer-thrower but debater, and passable in what the State\nUniversity considered scholarship. He had gone on, had captured the\nconstruction-company once owned by the Dodsworths, best-known pioneer\nfamily of Zenith. He built state capitols, skyscrapers, railway\nterminals. He was a heavy-shouldered, big-chested man, but not sluggish.\nThere was a quiet humor in his eyes, a syrup-smooth quickness in his\nspeech, which intimidated politicians and warned reporters; and in his\npresence the most intelligent scientist or the most sensitive artist\nfelt thin-blooded, unworldly, and a little shabby. He was, particularly\nwhen he was influencing legislatures or hiring labor-spies, very easy\nand lovable and gorgeous. He was baronial; he was a peer in the rapidly\ncrystallizing American aristocracy, inferior only to the haughty Old\nFamilies. (In Zenith, an Old Family is one which came to town before\n1840.) His power was the greater because he was not hindered by\nscruples, by either the vice or the virtue of the older Puritan\ntradition.\n\nMcKelvey was being placidly merry now with the great, the manufacturers\nand bankers, the land-owners and lawyers and surgeons who had chauffeurs\nand went to Europe. Babbitt squeezed among them. He liked McKelvey\xe2\x80\x99s\nsmile as much as the social advancement to be had from his favor. If in\nPaul\xe2\x80\x99s company he felt ponderous and protective, with McKelvey he felt\nslight and adoring.\n\nHe heard McKelvey say to Max Kruger, the banker, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll put up Sir\nGerald Doak.\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s democratic love for titles became a rich relish.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, he\xe2\x80\x99s one of the biggest iron-men in England, Max. Horribly\nwell-off.... Why, hello, old Georgie! Say, Max, George Babbitt is\ngetting fatter than I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe chairman shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cTake your seats, fellows!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we make a move, Charley?\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt said casually to McKelvey.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight. Hello, Paul! How\xe2\x80\x99s the old fiddler? Planning to sit anywhere\nspecial, George? Come on, let\xe2\x80\x99s grab some seats. Come on, Max. Georgie,\nI read about your speeches in the campaign. Bully work!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter that, Babbitt would have followed him through fire. He was\nenormously busy during the dinner, now bumblingly cheering Paul, now\napproaching McKelvey with \xe2\x80\x9cHear, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to build some piers in\nBrooklyn,\xe2\x80\x9d now noting how enviously the failures of the class, sitting\nby themselves in a weedy group, looked up to him in his association with\nthe nobility, now warming himself in the Society Talk of McKelvey and\nMax Kruger. They spoke of a \xe2\x80\x9cjungle dance\xe2\x80\x9d for which Mona Dodsworth had\ndecorated her house with thousands of orchids. They spoke, with an\nexcellent imitation of casualness, of a dinner in Washington at which\nMcKelvey had met a Senator, a Balkan princess, and an English\nmajor-general. McKelvey called the princess \xe2\x80\x9cJenny,\xe2\x80\x9d and let it be known\nthat he had danced with her.\n\nBabbitt was thrilled, but not so weighted with awe as to be silent. If\nhe was not invited by them to dinner, he was yet accustomed to talking\nwith bank-presidents, congressmen, and clubwomen who entertained poets.\nHe was bright and referential with McKelvey:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Charley, juh remember in Junior year how we chartered a sea-going\nhack and chased down to Riverdale, to the big show Madame Brown used to\nput on? Remember how you beat up that hick constabule that tried to run\nus in, and we pinched the pants-pressing sign and took and hung it on\nProf. Morrison\xe2\x80\x99s door? Oh, gosh, those were the days!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThose, McKelvey agreed, were the days.\n\nBabbitt had reached \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t the books you study in college but the\nfriendships you make that counts\xe2\x80\x9d when the men at head of the table\nbroke into song. He attacked McKelvey:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a shame, uh, shame to drift apart because our, uh, business\nactivities lie in different fields. I\xe2\x80\x99ve enjoyed talking over the good\nold days. You and Mrs. McKelvey must come to dinner some night.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVaguely, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike to talk to you about the growth of real estate out beyond your\nGrantsville warehouse. I might be able to tip you off to a thing or two,\npossibly.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSplendid! We must have dinner together, Georgie. Just let me know. And\nit will be a great pleasure to have your wife and you at the house,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid McKelvey, much less vaguely.\n\nThen the chairman\xe2\x80\x99s voice, that prodigious voice which once had roused\nthem to cheer defiance at rooters from Ohio or Michigan or Indiana,\nwhooped, \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, you wombats! All together in the long yell!\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt\nfelt that life would never be sweeter than now, when he joined with Paul\nRiesling and the newly recovered hero, McKelvey, in:\n\n    Baaaaaattle-ax\n    Get an ax,\n    Bal-ax,\n    Get-nax,\n    Who, who? The U.!\n    Hooroo!\n\n\nIII\n\nThe Babbitts invited the McKelveys to dinner, in early December, and the\nMcKelveys not only accepted but, after changing the date once or twice,\nactually came.\n\nThe Babbitts somewhat thoroughly discussed the details of the dinner,\nfrom the purchase of a bottle of champagne to the number of salted\nalmonds to be placed before each person. Especially did they mention the\nmatter of the other guests. To the last Babbitt held out for giving Paul\nRiesling the benefit of being with the McKelveys. \xe2\x80\x9cGood old Charley\nwould like Paul and Verg Gunch better than some highfalutin\xe2\x80\x99 Willy boy,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe insisted, but Mrs. Babbitt interrupted his observations with,\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--perhaps-- I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get some Lynnhaven oysters,\xe2\x80\x9d and when\nshe was quite ready she invited Dr. J. T. Angus, the oculist, and a\ndismally respectable lawyer named Maxwell, with their glittering wives.\n\nNeither Angus nor Maxwell belonged to the Elks or to the Athletic Club;\nneither of them had ever called Babbitt \xe2\x80\x9cbrother\xe2\x80\x9d or asked his opinions\non carburetors. The only \xe2\x80\x9chuman people\xe2\x80\x9d whom she invited, Babbitt raged,\nwere the Littlefields; and Howard Littlefield at times became so\nstatistical that Babbitt longed for the refreshment of Gunch\xe2\x80\x99s, \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\nold lemon-pie-face, what\xe2\x80\x99s the good word?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nImmediately after lunch Mrs. Babbitt began to set the table for the\nseven-thirty dinner to the McKelveys, and Babbitt was, by order, home at\nfour. But they didn\xe2\x80\x99t find anything for him to do, and three times Mrs.\nBabbitt scolded, \xe2\x80\x9cDo please try to keep out of the way!\xe2\x80\x9d He stood in the\ndoor of the garage, his lips drooping, and wished that Littlefield or\nSam Doppelbrau or somebody would come along and talk to him. He saw Ted\nsneaking about the corner of the house.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, old man?\xe2\x80\x9d said Babbitt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that you, thin, owld one? Gee, Ma certainly is on the warpath! I\ntold her Rone and I would jus\xe2\x80\x99 soon not be let in on the fiesta\nto-night, and she bit me. She says I got to take a bath, too. But, say,\nthe Babbitt men will be some lookers to-night! Little Theodore in a\ndress-suit!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Babbitt men!\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt liked the sound of it. He put his arm about\nthe boy\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. He wished that Paul Riesling had a daughter, so that\nTed might marry her. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, your mother is kind of rouncing round, all\nright,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and they laughed together, and sighed together, and\ndutifully went in to dress.\n\nThe McKelveys were less than fifteen minutes late.\n\nBabbitt hoped that the Doppelbraus would see the McKelveys\xe2\x80\x99 limousine,\nand their uniformed chauffeur, waiting in front.\n\nThe dinner was well cooked and incredibly plentiful, and Mrs. Babbitt\nhad brought out her grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s silver candlesticks. Babbitt worked\nhard. He was good. He told none of the jokes he wanted to tell. He\nlistened to the others. He started Maxwell off with a resounding, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s\nhear about your trip to the Yellowstone.\xe2\x80\x9d He was laudatory, extremely\nlaudatory. He found opportunities to remark that Dr. Angus was a\nbenefactor to humanity, Maxwell and Howard Littlefield profound\nscholars, Charles McKelvey an inspiration to ambitious youth, and Mrs.\nMcKelvey an adornment to the social circles of Zenith, Washington, New\nYork, Paris, and numbers of other places.\n\nBut he could not stir them. It was a dinner without a soul. For no\nreason that was clear to Babbitt, heaviness was over them and they spoke\nlaboriously and unwillingly.\n\nHe concentrated on Lucile McKelvey, carefully not looking at her\nblanched lovely shoulder and the tawny silken band which supported her\nfrock.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ll be going to Europe pretty soon again, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d he\ninvited.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like awfully to run over to Rome for a few weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you see a lot of pictures and music and curios and everything\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, what I really go for is: there\xe2\x80\x99s a little _trattoria_ on the Via\ndella Scrofa where you get the best _fettuccine_ in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I-- Yes. That must be nice to try that. Yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt a quarter to ten McKelvey discovered with profound regret that his\nwife had a headache. He said blithely, as Babbitt helped him with his\ncoat, \xe2\x80\x9cWe must lunch together some time and talk over the old days.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen the others had labored out, at half-past ten, Babbitt turned to his\nwife, pleading, \xe2\x80\x9cCharley said he had a corking time and we must\nlunch--said they wanted to have us up to the house for dinner before\nlong.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe achieved, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s just been one of those quiet evenings that are\noften so much more enjoyable than noisy parties where everybody talks at\nonce and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really settle down to--nice quiet enjoyment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut from his cot on the sleeping-porch he heard her weeping, slowly,\nwithout hope.\n\n\nIV\n\nFor a month they watched the social columns, and waited for a return\ndinner-invitation.\n\nAs the hosts of Sir Gerald Doak, the McKelveys were headlined all the\nweek after the Babbitts\xe2\x80\x99 dinner. Zenith ardently received Sir Gerald\n(who had come to America to buy coal). The newspapers interviewed him on\nprohibition, Ireland, unemployment, naval aviation, the rate of\nexchange, tea-drinking _versus_ whisky-drinking, the psychology of\nAmerican women, and daily life as lived by English county families. Sir\nGerald seemed to have heard of all those topics. The McKelveys gave him\na Singhalese dinner, and Miss Elnora Pearl Bates, society editor of the\n_Advocate-Times_, rose to her highest larknote. Babbitt read aloud at\nbreakfast-table:\n\n     \xe2\x80\x99Twixt the original and Oriental decorations, the strange and\n     delicious food, and the personalities both of the distinguished\n     guests, the charming hostess and the noted host, never has Zenith\n     seen a more recherche affair than the Ceylon dinner-dance given\n     last evening by Mr. and Mrs. Charles McKelvey to Sir Gerald Doak.\n     Methought as we--fortunate one!--were privileged to view that fairy\n     and foreign scene, nothing at Monte Carlo or the choicest\n     ambassadorial sets of foreign capitals could be more lovely. It is\n     not for nothing that Zenith is in matters social rapidly becoming\n     known as the choosiest inland city in the country.\n\n     Though he is too modest to admit it, Lord Doak gives a cachet to\n     our smart quartier such as it has not received since the\n     ever-memorable visit of the Earl of Sittingbourne. Not only is he\n     of the British peerage, but he is also, on dit, a leader of the\n     British metal industries. As he comes from Nottingham, a favorite\n     haunt of Robin Hood, though now, we are informed by Lord Doak, a\n     live modern city of 275,573 inhabitants, and important lace as well\n     as other industries, we like to think that perhaps through his\n     veins runs some of the blood, both virile red and bonny blue, of\n     that earlier lord o\xe2\x80\x99 the good greenwood, the roguish Robin.\n\n     The lovely Mrs. McKelvey never was more fascinating than last\n     evening in her black net gown relieved by dainty bands of silver\n     and at her exquisite waist a glowing cluster of Aaron Ward roses.\n\nBabbitt said bravely, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope they don\xe2\x80\x99t invite us to meet this Lord\nDoak guy. Darn sight rather just have a nice quiet little dinner with\nCharley and the Missus.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt the Zenith Athletic Club they discussed it amply. \xe2\x80\x9cI s\xe2\x80\x99pose we\xe2\x80\x99ll\nhave to call McKelvey \xe2\x80\x98Lord Chaz\xe2\x80\x99 from now on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sidney Finkelstein.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt beats all get-out,\xe2\x80\x9d meditated that man of data, Howard Littlefield,\n\xe2\x80\x9chow hard it is for some people to get things straight. Here they call\nthis fellow \xe2\x80\x98Lord Doak\xe2\x80\x99 when it ought to be \xe2\x80\x98Sir Gerald.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt marvelled, \xe2\x80\x9cIs that a fact! Well, well! \xe2\x80\x98Sir Gerald,\xe2\x80\x99 eh? That\xe2\x80\x99s\nwhat you call um, eh? Well, sir, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to know that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLater he informed his salesmen, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s funnier \xe2\x80\x99n a goat the way some\nfolks that, just because they happen to lay up a big wad, go\nentertaining famous foreigners, don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more idea \xe2\x80\x99n a rabbit how\nto address \xe2\x80\x99em so\xe2\x80\x99s to make \xe2\x80\x99em feel at home!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThat evening, as he was driving home, he passed McKelvey\xe2\x80\x99s limousine and\nsaw Sir Gerald, a large, ruddy, pop-eyed, Teutonic Englishman whose\ndribble of yellow mustache gave him an aspect sad and doubtful. Babbitt\ndrove on slowly, oppressed by futility. He had a sudden, unexplained,\nand horrible conviction that the McKelveys were laughing at him.\n\nHe betrayed his depression by the violence with which he informed his\nwife, \xe2\x80\x9cFolks that really tend to business haven\xe2\x80\x99t got the time to waste\non a bunch like the McKelveys. This society stuff is like any other\nhobby; if you devote yourself to it, you get on. But I like to have a\nchance to visit with you and the children instead of all this idiotic\nchasing round.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey did not speak of the McKelveys again.\n\n\nV\n\nIt was a shame, at this worried time, to have to think about the\nOverbrooks.\n\nEd Overbrook was a classmate of Babbitt who had been a failure. He had a\nlarge family and a feeble insurance business out in the suburb of\nDorchester. He was gray and thin and unimportant. He had always been\ngray and thin and unimportant. He was the person whom, in any group, you\nforgot to introduce, then introduced with extra enthusiasm. He had\nadmired Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s good-fellowship in college, had admired ever since his\npower in real estate, his beautiful house and wonderful clothes. It\npleased Babbitt, though it bothered him with a sense of responsibility.\nAt the class-dinner he had seen poor Overbrook, in a shiny blue serge\nbusiness-suit, being diffident in a corner with three other failures. He\nhad gone over and been cordial: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, hello, young Ed! I hear you\xe2\x80\x99re\nwriting all the insurance in Dorchester now. Bully work!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey recalled the good old days when Overbrook used to write poetry.\nOverbrook embarrassed him by blurting, \xe2\x80\x9cSay, Georgie, I hate to think of\nhow we been drifting apart. I wish you and Mrs. Babbitt would come to\ndinner some night.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt boomed, \xe2\x80\x9cFine! Sure! Just let me know. And the wife and I want\nto have you at the house.\xe2\x80\x9d He forgot it, but unfortunately Ed Overbrook\ndid not. Repeatedly he telephoned to Babbitt, inviting him to dinner.\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight as well go and get it over,\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt groaned to his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t it simply amaze you the way the poor fish doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know the first\nthing about social etiquette? Think of him \xe2\x80\x99phoning me, instead of his\nwife sitting down and writing us a regular bid! Well, I guess we\xe2\x80\x99re\nstuck for it. That\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble with all this class-brother\nhooptedoodle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe accepted Overbrook\xe2\x80\x99s next plaintive invitation, for an evening two\nweeks off. A dinner two weeks off, even a family dinner, never seems so\nappalling, till the two weeks have astoundingly disappeared and one\ncomes dismayed to the ambushed hour. They had to change the date,\nbecause of their own dinner to the McKelveys, but at last they gloomily\ndrove out to the Overbrooks\xe2\x80\x99 house in Dorchester.\n\nIt was miserable from the beginning. The Overbrooks had dinner at\nsix-thirty, while the Babbitts never dined before seven. Babbitt\npermitted himself to be ten minutes late. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s make it as short as\npossible. I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll duck out quick. I\xe2\x80\x99ll say I have to be at the\noffice extra early to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he planned.\n\nThe Overbrook house was depressing. It was the second story of a wooden\ntwo-family dwelling; a place of baby-carriages, old hats hung in the\nhall, cabbage-smell, and a Family Bible on the parlor table. Ed\nOverbrook and his wife were as awkward and threadbare as usual, and the\nother guests were two dreadful families whose names Babbitt never caught\nand never desired to catch. But he was touched, and disconcerted, by the\ntactless way in which Overbrook praised him: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re mighty proud to have\nold George here to-night! Of course you\xe2\x80\x99ve all read about his speeches\nand oratory in the papers--and the boy\xe2\x80\x99s good-looking, too, eh?--but\nwhat I always think of is back in college, and what a great old mixer\nhe was, and one of the best swimmers in the class.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt tried to be jovial; he worked at it; but he could find nothing\nto interest him in Overbrook\xe2\x80\x99s timorousness, the blankness of the other\nguests, or the drained stupidity of Mrs. Overbrook, with her spectacles,\ndrab skin, and tight-drawn hair. He told his best Irish story, but it\nsank like soggy cake. Most bleary moment of all was when Mrs. Overbrook,\npeering out of her fog of nursing eight children and cooking and\nscrubbing, tried to be conversational.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you go to Chicago and New York right along, Mr. Babbitt,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nprodded.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I get to Chicago fairly often.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be awfully interesting. I suppose you take in all the\ntheaters.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to tell the truth, Mrs. Overbrook, thing that hits me best is a\ngreat big beefsteak at a Dutch restaurant in the Loop!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey had nothing more to say. Babbitt was sorry, but there was no hope;\nthe dinner was a failure. At ten, rousing out of the stupor of\nmeaningless talk, he said as cheerily as he could, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Fraid we got to be\nstarting, Ed. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a fellow coming to see me early to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d As\nOverbrook helped him with his coat, Babbitt said, \xe2\x80\x9cNice to rub up on the\nold days! We must have lunch together, P.D.Q.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMrs. Babbitt sighed, on their drive home, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was pretty terrible. But\nhow Mr. Overbrook does admire you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYep. Poor cuss! Seems to think I\xe2\x80\x99m a little tin archangel, and the\nbest-looking man in Zenith.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99re certainly not that but-- Oh, Georgie, you don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose we\nhave to invite them to dinner at our house now, do we?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOuch! Gaw, I hope not!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here, now, George! You didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything about it to Mr.\nOverbrook, did you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! Gee! No! Honest, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t! Just made a bluff about having him to\nlunch some time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell.... Oh, dear.... I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hurt their feelings. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nsee how I could stand another evening like this one. And suppose\nsomebody like Dr. and Mrs. Angus came in when we had the Overbrooks\nthere, and thought they were friends of ours!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFor a week they worried, \xe2\x80\x9cWe really ought to invite Ed and his wife,\npoor devils!\xe2\x80\x9d But as they never saw the Overbrooks, they forgot them,\nand after a month or two they said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat really was the best way, just\nto let it slide. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be kind to _them_ to have them here. They\xe2\x80\x99d\nfeel so out of place and hard-up in our home.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey did not speak of the Overbrooks again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nI\n\nThe certainty that he was not going to be accepted by the McKelveys made\nBabbitt feel guilty and a little absurd. But he went more regularly to\nthe Elks; at a Chamber of Commerce luncheon he was oratorical regarding\nthe wickedness of strikes; and again he saw himself as a Prominent\nCitizen.\n\nHis clubs and associations were food comfortable to his spirit.\n\nOf a decent man in Zenith it was required that he should belong to one,\npreferably two or three, of the innumerous \xe2\x80\x9clodges\xe2\x80\x9d and\nprosperity-boosting lunch-clubs; to the Rotarians, the Kiwanis, or the\nBoosters; to the Oddfellows, Moose, Masons, Red Men, Woodmen, Owls,\nEagles, Maccabees, Knights of Pythias, Knights of Columbus, and other\nsecret orders characterized by a high degree of heartiness, sound\nmorals, and reverence for the Constitution. There were four reasons for\njoining these orders: It was the thing to do. It was good for business,\nsince lodge-brothers frequently became customers. It gave to Americans\nunable to become Geheimr\xc3\xa4te or Commendatori such unctuous honorifics as\nHigh Worthy Recording Scribe and Grand Hoogow to add to the commonplace\ndistinctions of Colonel, Judge, and Professor. And it permitted the\nswaddled American husband to stay away from home for one evening a week.\nThe lodge was his piazza, his pavement caf\xc3\xa9. He could shoot pool and\ntalk man-talk and be obscene and valiant.\n\nBabbitt was what he called a \xe2\x80\x9cjoiner\xe2\x80\x9d for all these reasons.\n\nBehind the gold and scarlet banner of his public achievements was the\ndun background of office-routine: leases, sales-contracts, lists of\nproperties to rent. The evenings of oratory and committees and lodges\nstimulated him like brandy, but every morning he was sandy-tongued. Week\nby week he accumulated nervousness. He was in open disagreement with his\noutside salesman, Stanley Graff; and once, though her charms had always\nkept him nickeringly polite to her, he snarled at Miss McGoun for\nchanging his letters.\n\nBut in the presence of Paul Riesling he relaxed. At least once a week\nthey fled from maturity. On Saturday they played golf, jeering, \xe2\x80\x9cAs a\ngolfer, you\xe2\x80\x99re a fine tennis-player,\xe2\x80\x9d or they motored all Sunday\nafternoon, stopping at village lunchrooms to sit on high stools at a\ncounter and drink coffee from thick cups. Sometimes Paul came over in\nthe evening with his violin, and even Zilla was silent as the lonely man\nwho had lost his way and forever crept down unfamiliar roads spun out\nhis dark soul in music.\n\n\nII\n\nNothing gave Babbitt more purification and publicity than his labors for\nthe Sunday School.\n\nHis church, the Chatham Road Presbyterian, was one of the largest and\nrichest, one of the most oaken and velvety, in Zenith. The pastor was\nthe Reverend John Jennison Drew, M.A., D.D., LL.D. (The M.A. and the\nD.D. were from Elbert University, Nebraska, the LL.D. from Waterbury\nCollege, Oklahoma.) He was eloquent, efficient, and versatile. He\npresided at meetings for the denunciation of unions or the elevation of\ndomestic service, and confided to the audiences that as a poor boy he\nhad carried newspapers. For the Saturday edition of the _Evening\nAdvocate_ he wrote editorials on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Manly Man\xe2\x80\x99s Religion\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nDollars and Sense Value of Christianity,\xe2\x80\x9d which were printed in bold\ntype surrounded by a wiggly border. He often said that he was \xe2\x80\x9cproud to\nbe known as primarily a business man\xe2\x80\x9d and that he certainly was not\ngoing to \xe2\x80\x9cpermit the old Satan to monopolize all the pep and punch.\xe2\x80\x9d He\nwas a thin, rustic-faced young man with gold spectacles and a bang of\ndull brown hair, but when he hurled himself into oratory he glowed with\npower. He admitted that he was too much the scholar and poet to imitate\nthe evangelist, Mike Monday, yet he had once awakened his fold to new\nlife, and to larger collections, by the challenge, \xe2\x80\x9cMy brethren, the\nreal cheap skate is the man who won\xe2\x80\x99t lend to the Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe had made his church a true community center. It contained everything\nbut a bar. It had a nursery, a Thursday evening supper with a short\nbright missionary lecture afterward, a gymnasium, a fortnightly\nmotion-picture show, a library of technical books for young\nworkmen--though, unfortunately, no young workman ever entered the church\nexcept to wash the windows or repair the furnace--and a sewing-circle\nwhich made short little pants for the children of the poor while Mrs.\nDrew read aloud from earnest novels.\n\nThough Dr. Drew\xe2\x80\x99s theology was Presbyterian, his church-building was\ngracefully Episcopalian. As he said, it had the \xe2\x80\x9cmost perdurable\nfeatures of those noble ecclesiastical monuments of grand Old England\nwhich stand as symbols of the eternity of faith, religious and civil.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIt was built of cheery iron-spot brick in an improved Gothic style, and\nthe main auditorium had indirect lighting from electric globes in lavish\nalabaster bowls.\n\nOn a December morning when the Babbitts went to church, Dr. John\nJennison Drew was unusually eloquent. The crowd was immense. Ten brisk\nyoung ushers, in morning coats with white roses, were bringing folding\nchairs up from the basement. There was an impressive musical program,\nconducted by Sheldon Smeeth, educational director of the Y.M.C.A., who\nalso sang the offertory. Babbitt cared less for this, because some\nmisguided person had taught young Mr. Smeeth to smile, smile, smile\nwhile he was singing, but with all the appreciation of a fellow-orator\nhe admired Dr. Drew\xe2\x80\x99s sermon. It had the intellectual quality which\ndistinguished the Chatham Road congregation from the grubby chapels on\nSmith Street.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt this abundant harvest-time of all the year,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Drew chanted,\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhen, though stormy the sky and laborious the path to the drudging\nwayfarer, yet the hovering and bodiless spirit swoops back o\xe2\x80\x99er all the\nlabors and desires of the past twelve months, oh, then it seems to me\nthere sounds behind all our apparent failures the golden chorus of\ngreeting from those passed happily on; and lo! on the dim horizon we see\nbehind dolorous clouds the mighty mass of mountains--mountains of\nmelody, mountains of mirth, mountains of might!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly do like a sermon with culture and thought in it,\xe2\x80\x9d meditated\nBabbitt.\n\nAt the end of the service he was delighted when the pastor, actively\nshaking hands at the door, twittered, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Brother Babbitt, can you wait\na jiffy? Want your advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure, doctor! You bet!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrop into my office. I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll like the cigars there.\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt did\nlike the cigars. He also liked the office, which was distinguished from\nother offices only by the spirited change of the familiar wall-placard\nto \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Busy Day.\xe2\x80\x9d Chum Frink came in, then William W.\nEathorne.\n\nMr. Eathorne was the seventy-year-old president of the First State Bank\nof Zenith. He still wore the delicate patches of side-whiskers which had\nbeen the uniform of bankers in 1870. If Babbitt was envious of the Smart\nSet of the McKelveys, before William Washington Eathorne he was\nreverent. Mr. Eathorne had nothing to do with the Smart Set. He was\nabove it. He was the great-grandson of one of the five men who founded\nZenith, in 1792, and he was of the third generation of bankers. He could\nexamine credits, make loans, promote or injure a man\xe2\x80\x99s business. In his\npresence Babbitt breathed quickly and felt young.\n\nThe Reverend Dr. Drew bounced into the room and flowered into speech:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve asked you gentlemen to stay so I can put a proposition before you.\nThe Sunday School needs bucking up. It\xe2\x80\x99s the fourth largest in Zenith,\nbut there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why we should take anybody\xe2\x80\x99s dust. We ought to be\nfirst. I want to request you, if you will, to form a committee of advice\nand publicity for the Sunday School; look it over and make any\nsuggestions for its betterment, and then, perhaps, see that the press\ngives us some attention--give the public some really helpful and\nconstructive news instead of all these murders and divorces.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcellent,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker.\n\nBabbitt and Frink were enchanted to join him.\n\n\nIII\n\nIf you had asked Babbitt what his religion was, he would have answered\nin sonorous Boosters\xe2\x80\x99-Club rhetoric, \xe2\x80\x9cMy religion is to serve my fellow\nmen, to honor my brother as myself, and to do my bit to make life\nhappier for one and all.\xe2\x80\x9d If you had pressed him for more detail, he\nwould have announced, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a member of the Presbyterian Church, and\nnaturally, I accept its doctrines.\xe2\x80\x9d If you had been so brutal as to go\non, he would have protested, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no use discussing and arguing\nabout religion; it just stirs up bad feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nActually, the content of his theology was that there was a supreme being\nwho had tried to make us perfect, but presumably had failed; that if one\nwas a Good Man he would go to a place called Heaven (Babbitt\nunconsciously pictured it as rather like an excellent hotel with a\nprivate garden), but if one was a Bad Man, that is, if he murdered or\ncommitted burglary or used cocaine or had mistresses or sold\nnon-existent real estate, he would be punished. Babbitt was uncertain,\nhowever, about what he called \xe2\x80\x9cthis business of Hell.\xe2\x80\x9d He explained to\nTed, \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty liberal; I don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly believe in a\nfire-and-brimstone Hell. Stands to reason, though, that a fellow can\xe2\x80\x99t\nget away with all sorts of Vice and not get nicked for it, see how I\nmean?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nUpon this theology he rarely pondered. The kernel of his practical\nreligion was that it was respectable, and beneficial to one\xe2\x80\x99s business,\nto be seen going to services; that the church kept the Worst Elements\nfrom being still worse; and that the pastor\xe2\x80\x99s sermons, however dull they\nmight seem at the time of taking, yet had a voodooistic power which \xe2\x80\x9cdid\na fellow good--kept him in touch with Higher Things.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHis first investigations for the Sunday School Advisory Committee did\nnot inspire him.\n\nHe liked the Busy Folks\xe2\x80\x99 Bible Class, composed of mature men and women\nand addressed by the old-school physician, Dr. T. Atkins Jordan, in a\nsparkling style comparable to that of the more refined humorous\nafter-dinner speakers, but when he went down to the junior classes he\nwas disconcerted. He heard Sheldon Smeeth, educational director of the\nY.M.C.A. and leader of the church-choir, a pale but strenuous young man\nwith curly hair and a smile, teaching a class of sixteen-year-old boys.\nSmeeth lovingly admonished them, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, fellows, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have a\nHeart to Heart Talk Evening at my house next Thursday. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get off by\nourselves and be frank about our Secret Worries. You can just tell old\nSheldy anything, like all the fellows do at the Y. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to explain\nfrankly about the horrible practises a kiddy falls into unless he\xe2\x80\x99s\nguided by a Big Brother, and about the perils and glory of Sex.\xe2\x80\x9d Old\nSheldy beamed damply; the boys looked ashamed; and Babbitt didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\nwhich way to turn his embarrassed eyes.\n\nLess annoying but also much duller were the minor classes which were\nbeing instructed in philosophy and Oriental ethnology by earnest\nspinsters. Most of them met in the highly varnished Sunday School room,\nbut there was an overflow to the basement, which was decorated with\nvaricose water-pipes and lighted by small windows high up in the oozing\nwall. What Babbitt saw, however, was the First Congregational Church of\nCatawba. He was back in the Sunday School of his boyhood. He smelled\nagain that polite stuffiness to be found only in church parlors; he\nrecalled the case of drab Sunday School books: \xe2\x80\x9cHetty, a Humble Heroine\xe2\x80\x9d\nand \xe2\x80\x9cJosephus, a Lad of Palestine;\xe2\x80\x9d he thumbed once more the\nhigh-colored text-cards which no boy wanted but no boy liked to throw\naway, because they were somehow sacred; he was tortured by the stumbling\nrote of thirty-five years ago, as in the vast Zenith church he listened\nto:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Edgar, you read the next verse. What does it mean when it says\nit\xe2\x80\x99s easier for a camel to go through a needle\xe2\x80\x99s eye? What does this\nteach us? Clarence! Please don\xe2\x80\x99t wiggle so! If you had studied your\nlesson you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so fidgety. Now, Earl, what is the lesson Jesus\nwas trying to teach his disciples? The one thing I want you to\nespecially remember, boys, is the words, \xe2\x80\x98With God all things are\npossible.\xe2\x80\x99 Just think of that always--Clarence, _please_ pay\nattention--just say \xe2\x80\x98With God all things are possible\xe2\x80\x99 whenever you feel\ndiscouraged, and, Alec, will you read the next verse; if you\xe2\x80\x99d pay\nattention you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lose your place!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDrone--drone--drone--gigantic bees that boomed in a cavern of\ndrowsiness--\n\nBabbitt started from his open-eyed nap, thanked the teacher for \xe2\x80\x9cthe\nprivilege of listening to her splendid teaching,\xe2\x80\x9d and staggered on to\nthe next circle.\n\nAfter two weeks of this he had no suggestions whatever for the Reverend\nDr. Drew.\n\nThen he discovered a world of Sunday School journals, an enormous and\nbusy domain of weeklies and monthlies which were as technical, as\npractical and forward-looking, as the real-estate columns or the\nshoe-trade magazines. He bought half a dozen of them at a religious\nbook-shop and till after midnight he read them and admired.\n\nHe found many lucrative tips on \xe2\x80\x9cFocusing Appeals,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cScouting for New\nMembers,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGetting Prospects to Sign up with the Sunday School.\xe2\x80\x9d He\nparticularly liked the word \xe2\x80\x9cprospects,\xe2\x80\x9d and he was moved by the rubric:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe moral springs of the community\xe2\x80\x99s life lie deep in its Sunday\nSchools--its schools of religious instruction and inspiration. Neglect\nnow means loss of spiritual vigor and moral power in years to come....\nFacts like the above, followed by a straight-arm appeal, will reach\nfolks who can never be laughed or jollied into doing their part.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt admitted, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so. I used to skin out of the ole Sunday\nSchool at Catawba every chance I got, but same time, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be where\nI am to-day, maybe, if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for its training in--in moral\npower. And all about the Bible. Great literature. Have to read some of\nit again, one of these days.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHow scientifically the Sunday School could be organized he learned from\nan article in the _Westminster Adult Bible Class_:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe second vice-president looks after the fellowship of the class. She\nchooses a group to help her. These become ushers. Every one who comes\ngets a glad hand. No one goes away a stranger. One member of the group\nstands on the doorstep and invites passers-by to come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPerhaps most of all Babbitt appreciated the remarks by William H.\nRidgway in the _Sunday School Times_:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have a Sunday School class without any pep and get-up-and-go in\nit, that is, without interest, that is uncertain in attendance, that\nacts like a fellow with the spring fever, let old Dr. Ridgway write you\na prescription. Rx. Invite the Bunch for Supper.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Sunday School journals were as well rounded as they were practical.\nThey neglected none of the arts. As to music the _Sunday School Times_\nadvertised that C. Harold Lowden, \xe2\x80\x9cknown to thousands through his sacred\ncompositions,\xe2\x80\x9d had written a new masterpiece, \xe2\x80\x9centitled \xe2\x80\x98Yearning for\nYou.\xe2\x80\x99 The poem, by Harry D. Kerr, is one of the daintiest you could\nimagine and the music is indescribably beautiful. Critics are agreed\nthat it will sweep the country. May be made into a charming sacred song\nby substituting the hymn words, \xe2\x80\x98I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEven manual training was adequately considered. Babbitt noted an\ningenious way of illustrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cModel for Pupils to Make. Tomb with Rolling Door.--Use a square covered\nbox turned upside down. Pull the cover forward a little to form a groove\nat the bottom. Cut a square door, also cut a circle of cardboard to more\nthan cover the door. Cover the circular door and the tomb thickly with\nstiff mixture of sand, flour and water and let it dry. It was the heavy\ncircular stone over the door the women found \xe2\x80\x98rolled away\xe2\x80\x99 on Easter\nmorning. This is the story we are to \xe2\x80\x98Go--tell.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn their advertisements the Sunday School journals were thoroughly\nefficient. Babbitt was interested in a preparation which \xe2\x80\x9ctakes the\nplace of exercise for sedentary men by building up depleted nerve\ntissue, nourishing the brain and the digestive system.\xe2\x80\x9d He was edified\nto learn that the selling of Bibles was a hustling and strictly\ncompetitive industry, and as an expert on hygiene he was pleased by the\nSanitary Communion Outfit Company\xe2\x80\x99s announcement of \xe2\x80\x9can improved and\nsatisfactory outfit throughout, including highly polished beautiful\nmahogany tray. This tray eliminates all noise, is lighter and more\neasily handled than others and is more in keeping with the furniture of\nthe church than a tray of any other material.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nIV\n\nHe dropped the pile of Sunday School journals.\n\nHe pondered, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, there\xe2\x80\x99s a real he-world. Corking!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAshamed I haven\xe2\x80\x99t sat in more. Fellow that\xe2\x80\x99s an influence in the\ncommunity--shame if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take part in a real virile hustling\nreligion. Sort of Christianity Incorporated, you might say.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut with all reverence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome folks might claim these Sunday School fans are undignified and\nunspiritual and so on. Sure! Always some skunk to spring things like\nthat! Knocking and sneering and tearing-down--so much easier than\nbuilding up. But me, I certainly hand it to these magazines. They\xe2\x80\x99ve\nbrought ole George F. Babbitt into camp, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the answer to the\ncritics!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe more manly and practical a fellow is, the more he ought to lead the\nenterprising Christian life. Me for it! Cut out this carelessness and\nboozing and-- Rone! Where the devil you been? This is a fine time o\xe2\x80\x99\nnight to be coming in!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nI\n\nThere are but three or four old houses in Floral Heights, and in Floral\nHeights an old house is one which was built before 1880. The largest of\nthese is the residence of William Washington Eathorne, president of the\nFirst State Bank.\n\nThe Eathorne Mansion preserves the memory of the \xe2\x80\x9cnice parts\xe2\x80\x9d of Zenith\nas they appeared from 1860 to 1900. It is a red brick immensity with\ngray sandstone lintels and a roof of slate in courses of red, green, and\ndyspeptic yellow. There are two anemic towers, one roofed with copper,\nthe other crowned with castiron ferns. The porch is like an open tomb;\nit is supported by squat granite pillars above which hang frozen\ncascades of brick. At one side of the house is a huge stained-glass\nwindow in the shape of a keyhole.\n\nBut the house has an effect not at all humorous. It embodies the heavy\ndignity of those Victorian financiers who ruled the generation between\nthe pioneers and the brisk \xe2\x80\x9csales-engineers\xe2\x80\x9d and created a somber\noligarchy by gaining control of banks, mills, land, railroads, mines.\nOut of the dozen contradictory Zeniths which together make up the true\nand complete Zenith, none is so powerful and enduring yet none so\nunfamiliar to the citizens as the small, still, dry, polite, cruel\nZenith of the William Eathornes; and for that tiny hierarchy the other\nZeniths unwittingly labor and insignificantly die.\n\nMost of the castles of the testy Victorian tetrarchs are gone now or\ndecayed into boarding-houses, but the Eathorne Mansion remains virtuous\nand aloof, reminiscent of London, Back Bay, Rittenhouse Square. Its\nmarble steps are scrubbed daily, the brass plate is reverently polished,\nand the lace curtains are as prim and superior as William Washington\nEathorne himself.\n\nWith a certain awe Babbitt and Chum Frink called on Eathorne for a\nmeeting of the Sunday School Advisory Committee; with uneasy stillness\nthey followed a uniformed maid through catacombs of reception-rooms to\nthe library. It was as unmistakably the library of a solid old banker as\nEathorne\xe2\x80\x99s side-whiskers were the side-whiskers of a solid old banker.\nThe books were most of them Standard Sets, with the correct and\ntraditional touch of dim blue, dim gold, and glossy calf-skin. The fire\nwas exactly correct and traditional; a small, quiet, steady fire,\nreflected by polished fire-irons. The oak desk was dark and old and\naltogether perfect; the chairs were gently supercilious.\n\nEathorne\xe2\x80\x99s inquiries as to the healths of Mrs. Babbitt, Miss Babbitt,\nand the Other Children were softly paternal, but Babbitt had nothing\nwith which to answer him. It was indecent to think of using the \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s\ntricks, ole socks?\xe2\x80\x9d which gratified Vergil Gunch and Frink and Howard\nLittlefield--men who till now had seemed successful and urbane. Babbitt\nand Frink sat politely, and politely did Eathorne observe, opening his\nthin lips just wide enough to dismiss the words, \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, before we\nbegin our conference--you may have felt the cold in coming here--so good\nof you to save an old man the journey--shall we perhaps have a whisky\ntoddy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo well trained was Babbitt in all the conversation that befits a Good\nFellow that he almost disgraced himself with \xe2\x80\x9cRather than make trouble,\nand always providin\xe2\x80\x99 there ain\xe2\x80\x99t any enforcement officers hiding in the\nwaste-basket--\xe2\x80\x9d The words died choking in his throat. He bowed in\nflustered obedience. So did Chum Frink.\n\nEathorne rang for the maid.\n\nThe modern and luxurious Babbitt had never seen any one ring for a\nservant in a private house, except during meals. Himself, in hotels, had\nrung for bell-boys, but in the house you didn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt Matilda\xe2\x80\x99s\nfeelings; you went out in the hall and shouted for her. Nor had he,\nsince prohibition, known any one to be casual about drinking. It was\nextraordinary merely to sip his toddy and not cry, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, maaaaan, this\nhits me right where I live!\xe2\x80\x9d And always, with the ecstasy of youth\nmeeting greatness, he marveled, \xe2\x80\x9cThat little fuzzy-face there, why, he\ncould make me or break me! If he told my banker to call my loans--!\nGosh! That quarter-sized squirt! And looking like he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got a single\nbit of hustle to him! I wonder-- Do we Boosters throw too many fits about\npep?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFrom this thought he shuddered away, and listened devoutly to Eathorne\xe2\x80\x99s\nideas on the advancement of the Sunday School, which were very clear and\nvery bad.\n\nDiffidently Babbitt outlined his own suggestions:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think if you analyze the needs of the school, in fact, going right at\nit as if it was a merchandizing problem, of course the one basic and\nfundamental need is growth. I presume we\xe2\x80\x99re all agreed we won\xe2\x80\x99t be\nsatisfied till we build up the biggest darn Sunday School in the whole\nstate, so the Chatham Road Presbyterian won\xe2\x80\x99t have to take anything off\nanybody. Now about jazzing up the campaign for prospects: they\xe2\x80\x99ve\nalready used contesting teams, and given prizes to the kids that bring\nin the most members. And they made a mistake there: the prizes were a\nlot of folderols and doodads like poetry books and illustrated\nTestaments, instead of something a real live kid would want to work for,\nlike real cash or a speedometer for his motor cycle. Course I suppose\nit\xe2\x80\x99s all fine and dandy to illustrate the lessons with these decorated\nbook-marks and blackboard drawings and so on, but when it comes down to\nreal he-hustling, getting out and drumming up customers--or members, I\nmean, why, you got to make it worth a fellow\xe2\x80\x99s while.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I want to propose two stunts: First, divide the Sunday School into\nfour armies, depending on age. Everybody gets a military rank in his own\narmy according to how many members he brings in, and the duffers that\nlie down on us and don\xe2\x80\x99t bring in any, they remain privates. The pastor\nand superintendent rank as generals. And everybody has got to give\nsalutes and all the rest of that junk, just like a regular army, to make\n\xe2\x80\x99em feel it\xe2\x80\x99s worth while to get rank.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, second: Course the school has its advertising committee, but,\nLord, nobody ever really works good--nobody works well just for the love\nof it. The thing to do is to be practical and up-to-date, and hire a\nreal paid press-agent for the Sunday School--some newspaper fellow who\ncan give part of his time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure, you bet!\xe2\x80\x9d said Chum Frink.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink of the nice juicy bits he could get in!\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt crowed. \xe2\x80\x9cNot\nonly the big, salient, vital facts, about how fast the Sunday\nSchool--and the collection--is growing, but a lot of humorous gossip and\nkidding: about how some blowhard fell down on his pledge to get new\nmembers, or the good time the Sacred Trinity class of girls had at their\nwieniewurst party. And on the side, if he had time, the press-agent\nmight even boost the lessons themselves--do a little advertising for all\nthe Sunday Schools in town, in fact. No use being hoggish toward the\nrest of \xe2\x80\x99em, providing we can keep the bulge on \xe2\x80\x99em in membership.\nFrinstance, he might get the papers to-- Course I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a literary\ntraining like Frink here, and I\xe2\x80\x99m just guessing how the pieces ought to\nbe written, but take frinstance, suppose the week\xe2\x80\x99s lesson is about\nJacob; well, the press-agent might get in something that would have a\nfine moral, and yet with a trick headline that\xe2\x80\x99d get folks to read\nit--say like: _Jake Fools the Old Man; Makes Getaway with Girl and\nBankroll_. See how I mean? That\xe2\x80\x99d get their interest! Now, course, Mr.\nEathorne, you\xe2\x80\x99re conservative, and maybe you feel these stunts would be\nundignified, but honestly, I believe they\xe2\x80\x99d bring home the bacon.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEathorne folded his hands on his comfortable little belly and purred\nlike an aged pussy:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I say, first, that I have been very much pleased by your analysis\nof the situation, Mr. Babbitt. As you surmise, it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary in My\nPosition to be conservative, and perhaps endeavor to maintain a certain\nstandard of dignity. Yet I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll find me somewhat progressive. In\nour bank, for example, I hope I may say that we have as modern a method\nof publicity and advertising as any in the city. Yes, I fancy you\xe2\x80\x99ll\nfind us oldsters quite cognizant of the shifting spiritual values of the\nage. Yes, oh yes. And so, in fact, it pleases me to be able to say that\nthough personally I might prefer the sterner Presbyterianism of an\nearlier era--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt finally gathered that Eathorne was willing.\n\nChum Frink suggested as part-time press-agent one Kenneth Escott,\nreporter on the _Advocate-Times_.\n\nThey parted on a high plane of amity and Christian helpfulness.\n\nBabbitt did not drive home, but toward the center of the city. He wished\nto be by himself and exult over the beauty of intimacy with William\nWashington Eathorne.\n\n\nII\n\nA snow-blanched evening of ringing pavements and eager lights.\n\nGreat golden lights of trolley-cars sliding along the packed snow of the\nroadway. Demure lights of little houses. The belching glare of a distant\nfoundry, wiping out the sharp-edged stars. Lights of neighborhood drug\nstores where friends gossiped, well pleased, after the day\xe2\x80\x99s work.\n\nThe green light of a police-station, and greener radiance on the snow;\nthe drama of a patrol-wagon--gong beating like a terrified heart,\nheadlights scorching the crystal-sparkling street, driver not a\nchauffeur but a policeman proud in uniform, another policeman perilously\ndangling on the step at the back, and a glimpse of the prisoner. A\nmurderer, a burglar, a coiner cleverly trapped?\n\nAn enormous graystone church with a rigid spire; dim light in the\nParlors, and cheerful droning of choir-practise. The quivering green\nmercury-vapor light of a photo-engraver\xe2\x80\x99s loft. Then the storming lights\nof down-town; parked cars with ruby tail-lights; white arched entrances\nto movie theaters, like frosty mouths of winter caves; electric\nsigns--serpents and little dancing men of fire; pink-shaded globes and\nscarlet jazz music in a cheap up-stairs dance-hall; lights of Chinese\nrestaurants, lanterns painted with cherry-blossoms and with pagodas,\nhung against lattices of lustrous gold and black. Small dirty lamps in\nsmall stinking lunchrooms. The smart shopping-district, with rich and\nquiet light on crystal pendants and furs and suave surfaces of polished\nwood in velvet-hung reticent windows. High above the street, an\nunexpected square hanging in the darkness, the window of an office where\nsome one was working late, for a reason unknown and stimulating. A man\nmeshed in bankruptcy, an ambitious boy, an oil-man suddenly become rich?\n\nThe air was shrewd, the snow was deep in uncleared alleys, and beyond\nthe city, Babbitt knew, were hillsides of snow-drift among wintry oaks,\nand the curving ice-enchanted river.\n\nHe loved his city with passionate wonder. He lost the accumulated\nweariness of business-worry and expansive oratory; he felt young and\npotential. He was ambitious. It was not enough to be a Vergil Gunch, an\nOrville Jones. No. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re bully fellows, simply lovely, but they\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t got any finesse.\xe2\x80\x9d No. He was going to be an Eathorne; delicately\nrigorous, coldly powerful.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the stuff. The wallop in the velvet mitt. Not let anybody get\nfresh with you. Been getting careless about my diction. Slang.\nColloquial. Cut it out. I was first-rate at rhetoric in college. Themes\non-- Anyway, not bad. Had too much of this hooptedoodle and good-fellow\nstuff. I-- Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t I organize a bank of my own some day? And Ted\nsucceed me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe drove happily home, and to Mrs. Babbitt he was a William Washington\nEathorne, but she did not notice it.\n\n\nIII\n\nYoung Kenneth Escott, reporter on the _Advocate-Times_, was appointed\npress-agent of the Chatham Road Presbyterian Sunday School. He gave six\nhours a week to it. At least he was paid for giving six hours a week. He\nhad friends on the _Press_ and the _Gazette_ and he was not (officially)\nknown as a press-agent. He procured a trickle of insinuating items about\nneighborliness and the Bible, about class-suppers, jolly but\neducational, and the value of the Prayer-life in attaining financial\nsuccess.\n\nThe Sunday School adopted Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s system of military ranks. Quickened\nby this spiritual refreshment, it had a boom. It did not become the\nlargest school in Zenith--the Central Methodist Church kept ahead of it\nby methods which Dr. Drew scored as \xe2\x80\x9cunfair, undignified, un-American,\nungentlemanly, and unchristian\xe2\x80\x9d--but it climbed from fourth place to\nsecond, and there was rejoicing in heaven, or at least in that portion\nof heaven included in the parsonage of Dr. Drew, while Babbitt had much\npraise and good repute.\n\nHe had received the rank of colonel on the general staff of the school.\nHe was plumply pleased by salutes on the street from unknown small boys;\nhis ears were tickled to ruddy ecstasy by hearing himself called\n\xe2\x80\x9cColonel;\xe2\x80\x9d and if he did not attend Sunday School merely to be thus\nexalted, certainly he thought about it all the way there.\n\nHe was particularly pleasant to the press-agent, Kenneth Escott; he took\nhim to lunch at the Athletic Club and had him at the house for dinner.\n\nLike many of the cocksure young men who forage about cities in apparent\ncontentment and who express their cynicism in supercilious slang, Escott\nwas shy and lonely. His shrewd starveling face broadened with joy at\ndinner, and he blurted, \xe2\x80\x9cGee whillikins, Mrs. Babbitt, if you knew how\ngood it is to have home eats again!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEscott and Verona liked each other. All evening they \xe2\x80\x9ctalked about\nideas.\xe2\x80\x9d They discovered that they were Radicals. True, they were\nsensible about it. They agreed that all communists were criminals; that\nthis _vers libre_ was tommyrot; and that while there ought to be\nuniversal disarmament, of course Great Britain and the United States\nmust, on behalf of oppressed small nations, keep a navy equal to the\ntonnage of all the rest of the world. But they were so revolutionary\nthat they predicted (to Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s irritation) that there would some day\nbe a Third Party which would give trouble to the Republicans and\nDemocrats.\n\nEscott shook hands with Babbitt three times, at parting.\n\nBabbitt mentioned his extreme fondness for Eathorne.\n\nWithin a week three newspapers presented accounts of Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s sterling\nlabors for religion, and all of them tactfully mentioned William\nWashington Eathorne as his collaborator.\n\nNothing had brought Babbitt quite so much credit at the Elks, the\nAthletic Club, and the Boosters\xe2\x80\x99. His friends had always congratulated\nhim on his oratory, but in their praise was doubt, for even in speeches\nadvertising the city there was something highbrow and degenerate, like\nwriting poetry. But now Orville Jones shouted across the Athletic\ndining-room, \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the new director of the First State Bank!\xe2\x80\x9d Grover\nButterbaugh, the eminent wholesaler of plumbers\xe2\x80\x99 supplies, chuckled,\n\xe2\x80\x9cWonder you mix with common folks, after holding Eathorne\xe2\x80\x99s hand!\xe2\x80\x9d And\nEmil Wengert, the jeweler, was at last willing to discuss buying a house\nin Dorchester.\n\n\nIV\n\nWhen the Sunday School campaign was finished, Babbitt suggested to\nKenneth Escott, \xe2\x80\x9cSay, how about doing a little boosting for Doc Drew\npersonally?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEscott grinned. \xe2\x80\x9cYou trust the doc to do a little boosting for himself,\nMr. Babbitt! There\xe2\x80\x99s hardly a week goes by without his ringing up the\npaper to say if we\xe2\x80\x99ll chase a reporter up to his Study, he\xe2\x80\x99ll let us in\non the story about the swell sermon he\xe2\x80\x99s going to preach on the\nwickedness of short skirts, or the authorship of the Pentateuch. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\nyou worry about him. There\xe2\x80\x99s just one better publicity-grabber in town,\nand that\xe2\x80\x99s this Dora Gibson Tucker that runs the Child Welfare and the\nAmericanization League, and the only reason she\xe2\x80\x99s got Drew beaten is\nbecause she has got _some_ brains!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now Kenneth, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you ought to talk that way about the\ndoctor. A preacher has to watch his interests, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he? You remember\nthat in the Bible about--about being diligent in the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s business, or\nsomething?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get something in if you want me to, Mr. Babbitt, but\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll have to wait till the managing editor is out of town, and then\nblackjack the city editor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThus it came to pass that in the Sunday _Advocate-Times_, under a\npicture of Dr. Drew at his earnestest, with eyes alert, jaw as granite,\nand rustic lock flamboyant, appeared an inscription--a wood-pulp tablet\nconferring twenty-four hours\xe2\x80\x99 immortality:\n\n     The Rev. Dr. John Jennison Drew, M.A., pastor of the beautiful\n     Chatham Road Presbyterian Church in lovely Floral Heights, is a\n     wizard soul-winner. He holds the local record for conversions.\n     During his shepherdhood an average of almost a hundred sin-weary\n     persons per year have declared their resolve to lead a new life and\n     have found a harbor of refuge and peace.\n\n     Everything zips at the Chatham Road Church. The subsidiary\n     organizations are keyed to the top-notch of efficiency. Dr. Drew is\n     especially keen on good congregational singing. Bright cheerful\n     hymns are used at every meeting, and the special Sing Services\n     attract lovers of music and professionals from all parts of the\n     city.\n\n     On the popular lecture platform as well as in the pulpit Dr. Drew\n     is a renowned word-painter, and during the course of the year he\n     receives literally scores of invitations to speak at varied\n     functions both here and elsewhere.\n\n\nV\n\nBabbitt let Dr. Drew know that he was responsible for this tribute. Dr.\nDrew called him \xe2\x80\x9cbrother,\xe2\x80\x9d and shook his hand a great many times.\n\nDuring the meetings of the Advisory Committee, Babbitt had hinted that\nhe would be charmed to invite Eathorne to dinner, but Eathorne had\nmurmured, \xe2\x80\x9cSo nice of you--old man, now--almost never go out.\xe2\x80\x9d Surely\nEathorne would not refuse his own pastor. Babbitt said boyishly to Drew:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, doctor, now we\xe2\x80\x99ve put this thing over, strikes me it\xe2\x80\x99s up to the\ndominie to blow the three of us to a dinner!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBully! You bet! Delighted!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Dr. Drew, in his manliest way. (Some\none had once told him that he talked like the late President Roosevelt.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, uh, say, doctor, be sure and get Mr. Eathorne to come. Insist on\nit. It\xe2\x80\x99s, uh-- I think he sticks around home too much for his own\nhealth.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEathorne came.\n\nIt was a friendly dinner. Babbitt spoke gracefully of the stabilizing\nand educational value of bankers to the community. They were, he said,\nthe pastors of the fold of commerce. For the first time Eathorne\ndeparted from the topic of Sunday Schools, and asked Babbitt about the\nprogress of his business. Babbitt answered modestly, almost filially.\n\nA few months later, when he had a chance to take part in the Street\nTraction Company\xe2\x80\x99s terminal deal, Babbitt did not care to go to his own\nbank for a loan. It was rather a quiet sort of deal and, if it had come\nout, the Public might not have understood. He went to his friend Mr.\nEathorne; he was welcomed, and received the loan as a private venture;\nand they both profited in their pleasant new association.\n\nAfter that, Babbitt went to church regularly, except on spring Sunday\nmornings which were obviously meant for motoring. He announced to Ted,\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, boy, there\xe2\x80\x99s no stronger bulwark of sound conservatism than\nthe evangelical church, and no better place to make friends who\xe2\x80\x99ll help\nyou to gain your rightful place in the community than in your own\nchurch-home!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nI\n\nThough he saw them twice daily, though he knew and amply discussed every\ndetail of their expenditures, yet for weeks together Babbitt was no more\nconscious of his children than of the buttons on his coat-sleeves.\n\nThe admiration of Kenneth Escott made him aware of Verona.\n\nShe had become secretary to Mr. Gruensberg of the Gruensberg Leather\nCompany; she did her work with the thoroughness of a mind which reveres\ndetails and never quite understands them; but she was one of the people\nwho give an agitating impression of being on the point of doing\nsomething desperate--of leaving a job or a husband--without ever doing\nit. Babbitt was so hopeful about Escott\xe2\x80\x99s hesitant ardors that he became\nthe playful parent. When he returned from the Elks he peered coyly into\nthe living-room and gurgled, \xe2\x80\x9cHas our Kenny been here to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d He\nnever credited Verona\xe2\x80\x99s protest, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Ken and I are just good friends,\nand we only talk about Ideas. I won\xe2\x80\x99t have all this sentimental\nnonsense, that would spoil everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was Ted who most worried Babbitt.\n\nWith conditions in Latin and English but with a triumphant record in\nmanual training, basket-ball, and the organization of dances, Ted was\nstruggling through his Senior year in the East Side High School. At home\nhe was interested only when he was asked to trace some subtle ill in the\nignition system of the car. He repeated to his tut-tutting father that\nhe did not wish to go to college or law-school, and Babbitt was equally\ndisturbed by this \xe2\x80\x9cshiftlessness\xe2\x80\x9d and by Ted\xe2\x80\x99s relations with Eunice\nLittlefield, next door.\n\nThough she was the daughter of Howard Littlefield, that wrought-iron\nfact-mill, that horse-faced priest of private ownership, Eunice was a\nmidge in the sun. She danced into the house, she flung herself into\nBabbitt\xe2\x80\x99s lap when he was reading, she crumpled his paper, and laughed\nat him when he adequately explained that he hated a crumpled newspaper\nas he hated a broken sales-contract. She was seventeen now. Her ambition\nwas to be a cinema actress. She did not merely attend the showing of\nevery \xe2\x80\x9cfeature film;\xe2\x80\x9d she also read the motion-picture magazines, those\nextraordinary symptoms of the Age of Pep--monthlies and weeklies\ngorgeously illustrated with portraits of young women who had recently\nbeen manicure girls, not very skilful manicure girls, and who, unless\ntheir every grimace had been arranged by a director, could not have\nacted in the Easter cantata of the Central Methodist Church; magazines\nreporting, quite seriously, in \xe2\x80\x9cinterviews\xe2\x80\x9d plastered with pictures of\nriding-breeches and California bungalows, the views on sculpture and\ninternational politics of blankly beautiful, suspiciously beautiful\nyoung men; outlining the plots of films about pure prostitutes and\nkind-hearted train-robbers; and giving directions for making bootblacks\ninto Celebrated Scenario Authors overnight.\n\nThese authorities Eunice studied. She could, she frequently did, tell\nwhether it was in November or December, 1905, that Mack Harker, the\nrenowned screen cowpuncher and badman, began his public career, as\nchorus man in \xe2\x80\x9cOh, You Naughty Girlie.\xe2\x80\x9d On the wall of her room, her\nfather reported, she had pinned up twenty-one photographs of actors. But\nthe signed portrait of the most graceful of the movie heroes she carried\nin her young bosom.\n\nBabbitt was bewildered by this worship of new gods, and he suspected\nthat Eunice smoked cigarettes. He smelled the cloying reek from\nup-stairs, and heard her giggling with Ted. He never inquired. The\nagreeable child dismayed him. Her thin and charming face was sharpened\nby bobbed hair; her skirts were short, her stockings were rolled, and,\nas she flew after Ted, above the caressing silk were glimpses of soft\nknees which made Babbitt uneasy, and wretched that she should consider\nhim old. Sometimes, in the veiled life of his dreams, when the fairy\nchild came running to him she took on the semblance of Eunice\nLittlefield.\n\nTed was motor-mad as Eunice was movie-mad.\n\nA thousand sarcastic refusals did not check his teasing for a car of his\nown. However lax he might be about early rising and the prosody of\nVergil, he was tireless in tinkering. With three other boys he bought a\nrheumatic Ford chassis, built an amazing racer-body out of tin and pine,\nwent skidding round corners in the perilous craft, and sold it at a\nprofit. Babbitt gave him a motor-cycle, and every Saturday afternoon,\nwith seven sandwiches and a bottle of Coca-Cola in his pockets, and\nEunice perched eerily on the rumble seat, he went roaring off to distant\ntowns.\n\nUsually Eunice and he were merely neighborhood chums, and quarreled with\na wholesome and violent lack of delicacy; but now and then, after the\ncolor and scent of a dance, they were silent together and a little\nfurtive, and Babbitt was worried.\n\nBabbitt was an average father. He was affectionate, bullying,\nopinionated, ignorant, and rather wistful. Like most parents, he enjoyed\nthe game of waiting till the victim was clearly wrong, then virtuously\npouncing. He justified himself by croaking, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Ted\xe2\x80\x99s mother spoils\nhim. Got to be somebody who tells him what\xe2\x80\x99s what, and me, I\xe2\x80\x99m elected\nthe goat. Because I try to bring him up to be a real, decent, human\nbeing and not one of these sapheads and lounge-lizards, of course they\nall call me a grouch!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThroughout, with the eternal human genius for arriving by the worst\npossible routes at surprisingly tolerable goals, Babbitt loved his son\nand warmed to his companionship and would have sacrificed everything for\nhim--if he could have been sure of proper credit.\n\n\nII\n\nTed was planning a party for his set in the Senior Class.\n\nBabbitt meant to be helpful and jolly about it. From his memory of\nhigh-school pleasures back in Catawba he suggested the nicest games:\nGoing to Boston, and charades with stewpans for helmets, and word-games\nin which you were an Adjective or a Quality. When he was most\nenthusiastic he discovered that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t paying attention; they were\nonly tolerating him. As for the party, it was as fixed and standardized\nas a Union Club Hop. There was to be dancing in the living-room, a noble\ncollation in the dining-room, and in the hall two tables of bridge for\nwhat Ted called \xe2\x80\x9cthe poor old dumb-bells that you can\xe2\x80\x99t get to dance\nhardly more \xe2\x80\x99n half the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEvery breakfast was monopolized by conferences on the affair. No one\nlistened to Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s bulletins about the February weather or to his\nthroat-clearing comments on the headlines. He said furiously, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I may\nbe _permitted_ to interrupt your engrossing private _conversation_-- Juh\nhear what I _said_?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t be a spoiled baby! Ted and I have just as much right to talk\nas you have!\xe2\x80\x9d flared Mrs. Babbitt.\n\nOn the night of the party he was permitted to look on, when he was not\nhelping Matilda with the Vecchia ice cream and the _petits fours_. He\nwas deeply disquieted. Eight years ago, when Verona had given a\nhigh-school party, the children had been featureless babies. Now they\nwere men and women of the world, very supercilious men and women; the\nboys condescended to Babbitt, they wore evening-clothes, and with\nhauteur they accepted cigarettes from silver cases. Babbitt had heard\nstories of what the Athletic Club called \xe2\x80\x9cgoings-on\xe2\x80\x9d at young parties;\nof girls \xe2\x80\x9cparking\xe2\x80\x9d their corsets in the dressing-room, of \xe2\x80\x9ccuddling\xe2\x80\x9d and\n\xe2\x80\x9cpetting,\xe2\x80\x9d and a presumable increase in what was known as Immorality.\nTo-night he believed the stories. These children seemed bold to him, and\ncold. The girls wore misty chiffon, coral velvet, or cloth of gold, and\naround their dipping bobbed hair were shining wreaths. He had it, upon\nurgent and secret inquiry, that no corsets were known to be parked\nupstairs; but certainly these eager bodies were not stiff with steel.\nTheir stockings were of lustrous silk, their slippers costly and\nunnatural, their lips carmined and their eyebrows penciled. They danced\ncheek to cheek with the boys, and Babbitt sickened with apprehension and\nunconscious envy.\n\nWorst of them all was Eunice Littlefield, and maddest of all the boys\nwas Ted. Eunice was a flying demon. She slid the length of the room; her\ntender shoulders swayed; her feet were deft as a weaver\xe2\x80\x99s shuttle; she\nlaughed, and enticed Babbitt to dance with her.\n\nThen he discovered the annex to the party.\n\nThe boys and girls disappeared occasionally, and he remembered rumors of\ntheir drinking together from hip-pocket flasks. He tiptoed round the\nhouse, and in each of the dozen cars waiting in the street he saw the\npoints of light from cigarettes, from each of them heard high giggles.\nHe wanted to denounce them but (standing in the snow, peering round the\ndark corner) he did not dare. He tried to be tactful. When he had\nreturned to the front hall he coaxed the boys, \xe2\x80\x9cSay, if any of you\nfellows are thirsty, there\xe2\x80\x99s some dandy ginger ale.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Thanks!\xe2\x80\x9d they condescended.\n\nHe sought his wife, in the pantry, and exploded, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to go in\nthere and throw some of those young pups out of the house! They talk\ndown to me like I was the butler! I\xe2\x80\x99d like to--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed; \xe2\x80\x9conly everybody says, all the mothers tell me,\nunless you stand for them, if you get angry because they go out to their\ncars to have a drink, they won\xe2\x80\x99t come to your house any more, and we\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want Ted left out of things, would we?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe announced that he would be enchanted to have Ted left out of things,\nand hurried in to be polite, lest Ted be left out of things.\n\nBut, he resolved, if he found that the boys were drinking, he\nwould--well, he\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x9chand \xe2\x80\x99em something that would surprise \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d While he\nwas trying to be agreeable to large-shouldered young bullies he was\nearnestly sniffing at them. Twice he caught the reek of prohibition-time\nwhisky, but then, it was only twice--\n\nDr. Howard Littlefield lumbered in.\n\nHe had come, in a mood of solemn parental patronage, to look on. Ted and\nEunice were dancing, moving together like one body. Littlefield gasped.\nHe called Eunice. There was a whispered duologue, and Littlefield\nexplained to Babbitt that Eunice\xe2\x80\x99s mother had a headache and needed her.\nShe went off in tears. Babbitt looked after them furiously. \xe2\x80\x9cThat little\ndevil! Getting Ted into trouble! And Littlefield, the conceited old\ngas-bag, acting like it was Ted that was the bad influence!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLater he smelled whisky on Ted\xe2\x80\x99s breath.\n\nAfter the civil farewell to the guests, the row was terrific, a thorough\nFamily Scene, like an avalanche, devastating and without reticences.\nBabbitt thundered, Mrs. Babbitt wept, Ted was unconvincingly defiant,\nand Verona in confusion as to whose side she was taking.\n\nFor several months there was coolness between the Babbitts and the\nLittlefields, each family sheltering their lamb from the wolf-cub next\ndoor. Babbitt and Littlefield still spoke in pontifical periods about\nmotors and the senate, but they kept bleakly away from mention of their\nfamilies. Whenever Eunice came to the house she discussed with pleasant\nintimacy the fact that she had been forbidden to come to the house; and\nBabbitt tried, with no success whatever, to be fatherly and advisory\nwith her.\n\n\nIII\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGosh all fishhooks!\xe2\x80\x9d Ted wailed to Eunice, as they wolfed hot\nchocolate, lumps of nougat, and an assortment of glac\xc3\xa9 nuts, in the\nmosaic splendor of the Royal Drug Store, \xe2\x80\x9cit gets me why Dad doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\njust pass out from being so poky. Every evening he sits there, about\nhalf-asleep, and if Rone or I say, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, come on, let\xe2\x80\x99s do something,\xe2\x80\x99 he\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t even take the trouble to think about it. He just yawns and says,\n\xe2\x80\x98Naw, this suits me right here.\xe2\x80\x99 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know there\xe2\x80\x99s any fun going\non anywhere. I suppose he must do some thinking, same as you and I do,\nbut gosh, there\xe2\x80\x99s no way of telling it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that outside of\nthe office and playing a little bum golf on Saturday he knows there\xe2\x80\x99s\nanything in the world to do except just keep sitting there--sitting\nthere every night--not wanting to go anywhere--not wanting to do\nanything--thinking us kids are crazy--sitting there--Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nIV\n\nIf he was frightened by Ted\xe2\x80\x99s slackness, Babbitt was not sufficiently\nfrightened by Verona. She was too safe. She lived too much in the neat\nlittle airless room of her mind. Kenneth Escott and she were always\nunder foot. When they were not at home, conducting their cautiously\nradical courtship over sheets of statistics, they were trudging off to\nlectures by authors and Hindu philosophers and Swedish lieutenants.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGosh,\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt wailed to his wife, as they walked home from the\nFogartys\xe2\x80\x99 bridge-party, \xe2\x80\x9cit gets me how Rone and that fellow can be so\npoky. They sit there night after night, whenever he isn\xe2\x80\x99t working, and\nthey don\xe2\x80\x99t know there\xe2\x80\x99s any fun in the world. All talk and\ndiscussion--Lord! Sitting there--sitting there--night after night--not\nwanting to do anything--thinking I\xe2\x80\x99m crazy because I like to go out and\nplay a fist of cards--sitting there--gosh!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen round the swimmer, bored by struggling through the perpetual surf\nof family life, new combers swelled.\n\n\nV\n\nBabbitt\xe2\x80\x99s father-and mother-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Henry T. Thompson,\nrented their old house in the Bellevue district and moved to the Hotel\nHatton, that glorified boarding-house filled with widows, red-plush\nfurniture, and the sound of ice-water pitchers. They were lonely there,\nand every other Sunday evening the Babbitts had to dine with them, on\nfricasseed chicken, discouraged celery, and cornstarch ice cream, and\nafterward sit, polite and restrained, in the hotel lounge, while a young\nwoman violinist played songs from the German via Broadway.\n\nThen Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s own mother came down from Catawba to spend three weeks.\n\nShe was a kind woman and magnificently uncomprehending. She\ncongratulated the convention-defying Verona on being a \xe2\x80\x9cnice, loyal\nhome-body without all these Ideas that so many girls seem to have\nnowadays;\xe2\x80\x9d and when Ted filled the differential with grease, out of pure\nlove of mechanics and filthiness, she rejoiced that he was \xe2\x80\x9cso handy\naround the house and helping his father and all, and not going out with\nthe girls all the time and trying to pretend he was a society fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt loved his mother, and sometimes he rather liked her, but he was\nannoyed by her Christian Patience, and he was reduced to pulpiness when\nshe discoursed about a quite mythical hero called \xe2\x80\x9cYour Father\xe2\x80\x9d:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t remember it, Georgie, you were such a little fellow at the\ntime--my, I remember just how you looked that day, with your goldy\nbrown curls and your lace collar, you always were such a dainty child,\nand kind of puny and sickly, and you loved pretty things so much and the\nred tassels on your little bootees and all--and Your Father was taking\nus to church and a man stopped us and said \xe2\x80\x98Major\xe2\x80\x99--so many of the\nneighbors used to call Your Father \xe2\x80\x98Major;\xe2\x80\x99 of course he was only a\nprivate in The War but everybody knew that was because of the jealousy\nof his captain and he ought to have been a high-ranking officer, he had\nthat natural ability to command that so very, very few men have--and\nthis man came out into the road and held up his hand and stopped the\nbuggy and said, \xe2\x80\x98Major,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of the folks around\nhere that have decided to support Colonel Scanell for congress, and we\nwant you to join us. Meeting people the way you do in the store, you\ncould help us a lot.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Your Father just looked at him and said, \xe2\x80\x98I certainly shall do\nnothing of the sort. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like his politics,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. Well, the\nman--Captain Smith they used to call him, and heaven only knows why,\nbecause he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the shadow or vestige of a right to be called\n\xe2\x80\x98Captain\xe2\x80\x99 or any other title--this Captain Smith said, \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll make it\nhot for you if you don\xe2\x80\x99t stick by your friends, Major.\xe2\x80\x99 Well, you know\nhow Your Father was, and this Smith knew it too; he knew what a Real Man\nhe was, and he knew Your Father knew the political situation from A to\nZ, and he ought to have seen that here was one man he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t impose\non, but he went on trying to and hinting and trying till Your Father\nspoke up and said to him, \xe2\x80\x98Captain Smith,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98I have a reputation\naround these parts for being one who is amply qualified to mind his own\nbusiness and let other folks mind theirs!\xe2\x80\x99 and with that he drove on and\nleft the fellow standing there in the road like a bump on a log!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt was most exasperated when she revealed his boyhood to the\nchildren. He had, it seemed, been fond of barley-sugar; had worn the\n\xe2\x80\x9cloveliest little pink bow in his curls\xe2\x80\x9d and corrupted his own name to\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoo-goo.\xe2\x80\x9d He heard (though he did not officially hear) Ted admonishing\nTinka, \xe2\x80\x9cCome on now, kid; stick the lovely pink bow in your curls and\nbeat it down to breakfast, or Goo-goo will jaw your head off.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt\xe2\x80\x99s half-brother, Martin, with his wife and youngest baby, came\ndown from Catawba for two days. Martin bred cattle and ran the dusty\ngeneral-store. He was proud of being a freeborn independent American of\nthe good old Yankee stock; he was proud of being honest, blunt, ugly,\nand disagreeable. His favorite remark was \xe2\x80\x9cHow much did you pay for\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d He regarded Verona\xe2\x80\x99s books, Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s silver pencil, and flowers\non the table as citified extravagances, and said so. Babbitt would have\nquarreled with him but for his gawky wife and the baby, whom Babbitt\nteased and poked fingers at and addressed:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think this baby\xe2\x80\x99s a bum, yes, sir, I think this little baby\xe2\x80\x99s a bum,\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s a bum, yes, sir, he\xe2\x80\x99s a bum, that\xe2\x80\x99s what he is, he\xe2\x80\x99s a bum, this\nbaby\xe2\x80\x99s a bum, he\xe2\x80\x99s nothing but an old bum, that\xe2\x80\x99s what he is--a bum!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAll the while Verona and Kenneth Escott held long inquiries into\nepistemology; Ted was a disgraced rebel; and Tinka, aged eleven, was\ndemanding that she be allowed to go to the movies thrice a week, \xe2\x80\x9clike\nall the girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt raged, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sick of it! Having to carry three generations. Whole\ndamn bunch lean on me. Pay half of mother\xe2\x80\x99s income, listen to Henry T.,\nlisten to Myra\xe2\x80\x99s worrying, be polite to Mart, and get called an old\ngrouch for trying to help the children. All of \xe2\x80\x99em depending on me and\npicking on me and not a damn one of \xe2\x80\x99em grateful! No relief, and no\ncredit, and no help from anybody. And to keep it up for--good Lord, how\nlong?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe enjoyed being sick in February; he was delighted by their\nconsternation that he, the rock, should give way.\n\nHe had eaten a questionable clam. For two days he was languorous and\npetted and esteemed. He was allowed to snarl \xe2\x80\x9cOh, let me alone!\xe2\x80\x9d\nwithout reprisals. He lay on the sleeping-porch and watched the winter\nsun slide along the taut curtains, turning their ruddy khaki to pale\nblood red. The shadow of the draw-rope was dense black, in an enticing\nripple on the canvas. He found pleasure in the curve of it, sighed as\nthe fading light blurred it. He was conscious of life, and a little sad.\nWith no Vergil Gunches before whom to set his face in resolute optimism,\nhe beheld, and half admitted that he beheld, his way of life as\nincredibly mechanical. Mechanical business--a brisk selling of badly\nbuilt houses. Mechanical religion--a dry, hard church, shut off from the\nreal life of the streets, inhumanly respectable as a top-hat. Mechanical\ngolf and dinner-parties and bridge and conversation. Save with Paul\nRiesling, mechanical friendships--back-slapping and jocular, never\ndaring to essay the test of quietness.\n\nHe turned uneasily in bed.\n\nHe saw the years, the brilliant winter days and all the long sweet\nafternoons which were meant for summery meadows, lost in such brittle\npretentiousness. He thought of telephoning about leases, of cajoling men\nhe hated, of making business calls and waiting in dirty anterooms--hat\non knee, yawning at fly-specked calendars, being polite to office-boys.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t hardly want to go back to work,\xe2\x80\x9d he prayed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to-- I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut he was back next day, busy and of doubtful temper.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nI\n\nThe Zenith Street Traction Company planned to build car-repair shops in\nthe suburb of Dorchester, but when they came to buy the land they found\nit held, on options, by the Babbitt-Thompson Realty Company. The\npurchasing-agent, the first vice-president, and even the president of\nthe Traction Company protested against the Babbitt price. They mentioned\ntheir duty toward stockholders, they threatened an appeal to the courts,\nthough somehow the appeal to the courts was never carried out and the\nofficials found it wiser to compromise with Babbitt. Carbon copies of\nthe correspondence are in the company\xe2\x80\x99s files, where they may be viewed\nby any public commission.\n\nJust after this Babbitt deposited three thousand dollars in the bank,\nthe purchasing-agent of the Street Traction Company bought a five\nthousand dollar car, the first vice-president built a home in Devon\nWoods, and the president was appointed minister to a foreign country.\n\nTo obtain the options, to tie up one man\xe2\x80\x99s land without letting his\nneighbor know, had been an unusual strain on Babbitt. It was necessary\nto introduce rumors about planning garages and stores, to pretend that\nhe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t taking any more options, to wait and look as bored as a\npoker-player at a time when the failure to secure a key-lot threatened\nhis whole plan. To all this was added a nerve-jabbing quarrel with his\nsecret associates in the deal. They did not wish Babbitt and Thompson to\nhave any share in the deal except as brokers. Babbitt rather agreed.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEthics of the business--broker ought to strictly represent his\nprinciples and not get in on the buying,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Thompson.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEthics, rats! Think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to see that bunch of holy grafters get\naway with the swag and us not climb in?\xe2\x80\x9d snorted old Henry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to do it. Kind of double-crossing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s triple-crossing. It\xe2\x80\x99s the public that gets\ndouble-crossed. Well, now we\xe2\x80\x99ve been ethical and got it out of our\nsystems, the question is where we can raise a loan to handle some of the\nproperty for ourselves, on the Q. T. We can\xe2\x80\x99t go to our bank for it.\nMight come out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could see old Eathorne. He\xe2\x80\x99s close as the tomb.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEathorne was glad, he said, to \xe2\x80\x9cinvest in character,\xe2\x80\x9d to make Babbitt\nthe loan and see to it that the loan did not appear on the books of the\nbank. Thus certain of the options which Babbitt and Thompson obtained\nwere on parcels of real estate which they themselves owned, though the\nproperty did not appear in their names.\n\nIn the midst of closing this splendid deal, which stimulated business\nand public confidence by giving an example of increased real-estate\nactivity, Babbitt was overwhelmed to find that he had a dishonest person\nworking for him.\n\nThe dishonest one was Stanley Graff, the outside salesman.\n\nFor some time Babbitt had been worried about Graff. He did not keep his\nword to tenants. In order to rent a house he would promise repairs which\nthe owner had not authorized. It was suspected that he juggled\ninventories of furnished houses so that when the tenant left he had to\npay for articles which had never been in the house and the price of\nwhich Graff put into his pocket. Babbitt had not been able to prove\nthese suspicions, and though he had rather planned to discharge Graff he\nhad never quite found time for it.\n\nNow into Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s private room charged a red-faced man, panting, \xe2\x80\x9cLook\nhere! I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to raise particular merry hell, and unless you have that\nfellow pinched, I will!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s-- Calm down, o\xe2\x80\x99 man. What\xe2\x80\x99s trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrouble! Huh! Here\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down and take it easy! They can hear you all over the building!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis fellow Graff you got working for you, he leases me a house. I was\nin yesterday and signs the lease, all O.K., and he was to get the\nowner\xe2\x80\x99s signature and mail me the lease last night. Well, and he did.\nThis morning I comes down to breakfast and the girl says a fellow had\ncome to the house right after the early delivery and told her he wanted\nan envelope that had been mailed by mistake, big long envelope with\n\xe2\x80\x98Babbitt-Thompson\xe2\x80\x99 in the corner of it. Sure enough, there it was, so\nshe lets him have it. And she describes the fellow to me, and it was\nthis Graff. So I \xe2\x80\x99phones to him and he, the poor fool, he admits it! He\nsays after my lease was all signed he got a better offer from another\nfellow and he wanted my lease back. Now what you going to do about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour name is--?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilliam Varney--W. K. Varney.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes. That was the Garrison house.\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt sounded the buzzer. When\nMiss McGoun came in, he demanded, \xe2\x80\x9cGraff gone out?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you look through his desk and see if there is a lease made out to\nMr. Varney on the Garrison house?\xe2\x80\x9d To Varney: \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t tell you how sorry\nI am this happened. Needless to say, I\xe2\x80\x99ll fire Graff the minute he comes\nin. And of course your lease stands. But there\xe2\x80\x99s one other thing I\xe2\x80\x99d\nlike to do. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell the owner not to pay us the commission but apply\nit to your rent. No! Straight! I want to. To be frank, this thing shakes\nme up bad. I suppose I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been a Practical Business Man. Probably\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve told one or two fairy stories in my time, when the occasion called\nfor it--you know: sometimes you have to lay things on thick, to impress\nboneheads. But this is the first time I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had to accuse one of my\nown employees of anything more dishonest than pinching a few stamps.\nHonest, it would hurt me if we profited by it. So you\xe2\x80\x99ll let me hand you\nthe commission? Good!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nII\n\nHe walked through the February city, where trucks flung up a spattering\nof slush and the sky was dark above dark brick cornices. He came back\nmiserable. He, who respected the law, had broken it by concealing the\nFederal crime of interception of the mails. But he could not see Graff\ngo to jail and his wife suffer. Worse, he had to discharge Graff, and\nthis was a part of office routine which he feared. He liked people so\nmuch, he so much wanted them to like him, that he could not bear\ninsulting them.\n\nMiss McGoun dashed in to whisper, with the excitement of an approaching\nscene, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s here!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Graff? Ask him to come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe tried to make himself heavy and calm in his chair, and to keep his\neyes expressionless. Graff stalked in--a man of thirty-five, dapper,\neye-glassed, with a foppish mustache.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWant me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Graff.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGraff continued to stand, grunting, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose that old nut Varney has\nbeen in to see you. Let me explain about him. He\xe2\x80\x99s a regular tightwad,\nand he sticks out for every cent, and he practically lied to me about\nhis ability to pay the rent-- I found that out just after we signed up.\nAnd then another fellow comes along with a better offer for the house,\nand I felt it was my duty to the firm to get rid of Varney, and I was so\nworried about it I skun up there and got back the lease. Honest, Mr.\nBabbitt, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t intend to pull anything crooked. I just wanted the\nfirm to have all the commis--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait now, Stan. This may all be true, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve been having a lot of\ncomplaints about you. Now I don\xe2\x80\x99t s\xe2\x80\x99pose you ever mean to do wrong, and\nI think if you just get a good lesson that\xe2\x80\x99ll jog you up a little,\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll turn out a first-class realtor yet. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how I can\nkeep you on.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGraff leaned against the filing-cabinet, his hands in his pockets, and\nlaughed. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I\xe2\x80\x99m fired! Well, old Vision and Ethics, I\xe2\x80\x99m tickled to\ndeath! But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to think you can get away with any\nholier-than-thou stuff. Sure I\xe2\x80\x99ve pulled some raw stuff--a little of\nit--but how could I help it, in this office?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, by God, young man--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTut, tut! Keep the naughty temper down, and don\xe2\x80\x99t holler, because\neverybody in the outside office will hear you. They\xe2\x80\x99re probably\nlistening right now. Babbitt, old dear, you\xe2\x80\x99re crooked in the first\nplace and a damn skinflint in the second. If you paid me a decent salary\nI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to steal pennies off a blind man to keep my wife from\nstarving. Us married just five months, and her the nicest girl living,\nand you keeping us flat broke all the time, you damned old thief, so you\ncan put money away for your saphead of a son and your wishywashy fool of\na daughter! Wait, now! You\xe2\x80\x99ll by God take it, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll bellow so the\nwhole office will hear it! And crooked-- Say, if I told the prosecuting\nattorney what I know about this last Street Traction option steal, both\nyou and me would go to jail, along with some nice, clean, pious, high-up\ntraction guns!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Stan, looks like we were coming down to cases. That deal-- There\nwas nothing crooked about it. The only way you can get progress is for\nthe broad-gauged men to get things done; and they got to be rewarded--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, for Pete\xe2\x80\x99s sake, don\xe2\x80\x99t get virtuous on me! As I gather it, I\xe2\x80\x99m\nfired. All right. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing for me. And if I catch you knocking\nme to any other firm, I\xe2\x80\x99ll squeal all I know about you and Henry T. and\nthe dirty little lickspittle deals that you corporals of industry pull\noff for the bigger and brainier crooks, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll get chased out of\ntown. And me--you\xe2\x80\x99re right, Babbitt, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been going crooked, but now\nI\xe2\x80\x99m going straight, and the first step will be to get a job in some\noffice where the boss doesn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about Ideals. Bad luck, old dear, and\nyou can stick your job up the sewer!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt sat for a long time, alternately raging, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have him\narrested,\xe2\x80\x9d and yearning \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder-- No, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never done anything that\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t necessary to keep the Wheels of Progress moving.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNext day he hired in Graff\xe2\x80\x99s place Fritz Weilinger, the salesman of his\nmost injurious rival, the East Side Homes and Development Company, and\nthus at once annoyed his competitor and acquired an excellent man. Young\nFritz was a curly-headed, merry, tennis-playing youngster. He made\ncustomers welcome to the office. Babbitt thought of him as a son, and in\nhim had much comfort.\n\n\nIII\n\nAn abandoned race-track on the outskirts of Chicago, a plot excellent\nfor factory sites, was to be sold, and Jake Offut asked Babbitt to bid\non it for him. The strain of the Street Traction deal and his\ndisappointment in Stanley Graff had so shaken Babbitt that he found it\nhard to sit at his desk and concentrate. He proposed to his family,\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, folks! Do you know who\xe2\x80\x99s going to trot up to Chicago for a\ncouple of days--just week-end; won\xe2\x80\x99t lose but one day of school--know\nwho\xe2\x80\x99s going with that celebrated business-ambassador, George F. Babbitt?\nWhy, Mr. Theodore Roosevelt Babbitt!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurray!\xe2\x80\x9d Ted shouted, and \xe2\x80\x9cOh, maybe the Babbitt men won\xe2\x80\x99t paint that\nlil ole town red!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd, once away from the familiar implications of home, they were two men\ntogether. Ted was young only in his assumption of oldness, and the only\nrealms, apparently, in which Babbitt had a larger and more grown-up\nknowledge than Ted\xe2\x80\x99s were the details of real estate and the phrases of\npolitics. When the other sages of the Pullman smoking-compartment had\nleft them to themselves, Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s voice did not drop into the playful\nand otherwise offensive tone in which one addresses children but\ncontinued its overwhelming and monotonous rumble, and Ted tried to\nimitate it in his strident tenor:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGee, dad, you certainly did show up that poor boot when he got flip\nabout the League of Nations!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the trouble with a lot of these fellows is, they simply don\xe2\x80\x99t\nknow what they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about. They don\xe2\x80\x99t get down to facts.... What\ndo you think of Ken Escott?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, dad: it strikes me Ken is a nice lad; no special faults\nexcept he smokes too much; but slow, Lord! Why, if we don\xe2\x80\x99t give him a\nshove the poor dumb-bell never will propose! And Rone just as bad.\nSlow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I guess you\xe2\x80\x99re right. They\xe2\x80\x99re slow. They haven\xe2\x80\x99t either one of \xe2\x80\x99em\ngot our pep.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right. They\xe2\x80\x99re slow. I swear, dad, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how Rone got\ninto our family! I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet, if the truth were known, you were a bad old\negg when you were a kid!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so slow!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bet you weren\xe2\x80\x99t! I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet you didn\xe2\x80\x99t miss many tricks!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, when I was out with the girls I didn\xe2\x80\x99t spend all the time telling\n\xe2\x80\x99em about the strike in the knitting industry!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey roared together, and together lighted cigars.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are we going to do with \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt consulted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGosh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I swear, sometimes I feel like taking Ken aside and\nputting him over the jumps and saying to him, \xe2\x80\x98Young fella me lad, are\nyou going to marry young Rone, or are you going to talk her to death?\nHere you are getting on toward thirty, and you\xe2\x80\x99re only making twenty or\ntwenty-five a week. When you going to develop a sense of responsibility\nand get a raise? If there\xe2\x80\x99s anything that George F. or I can do to help\nyou, call on us, but show a little speed, anyway!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, at that, it might not be so bad if you or I talked to him, except\nhe might not understand. He\xe2\x80\x99s one of these highbrows. He can\xe2\x80\x99t come\ndown to cases and lay his cards on the table and talk straight out from\nthe shoulder, like you or I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right, he\xe2\x80\x99s like all these highbrows.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so, like all of \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fact.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey sighed, and were silent and thoughtful and happy.\n\nThe conductor came in. He had once called at Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s office, to ask\nabout houses. \xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99 are you, Mr. Babbitt! We going to have you with us to\nChicago? This your boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, this is my son Ted.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, what do you know about that! Here I been thinking you were a\nyoungster yourself, not a day over forty, hardly, and you with this\ngreat big fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cForty? Why, brother, I\xe2\x80\x99ll never see forty-five again!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that a fact! Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 thought it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad give-away for the old man when he has to travel\nwith a young whale like Ted here!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re right, it is.\xe2\x80\x9d To Ted: \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re in college now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nProudly, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, not till next fall. I\xe2\x80\x99m just kind of giving the diff\xe2\x80\x99rent\ncolleges the once-over now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs the conductor went on his affable way, huge watch-chain jingling\nagainst his blue chest, Babbitt and Ted gravely considered colleges.\nThey arrived at Chicago late at night; they lay abed in the morning,\nrejoicing, \xe2\x80\x9cPretty nice not to have to get up and get down to breakfast,\nheh?\xe2\x80\x9d They were staying at the modest Eden Hotel, because Zenith\nbusiness men always stayed at the Eden, but they had dinner in the\nbrocade and crystal Versailles Room of the Regency Hotel. Babbitt\nordered Blue Point oysters with cocktail sauce, a tremendous steak with\na tremendous platter of French fried potatoes, two pots of coffee, apple\npie with ice cream for both of them and, for Ted, an extra piece of\nmince pie.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHot stuff! Some feed, young fella!\xe2\x80\x9d Ted admired.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh! You stick around with me, old man, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you a good time!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey went to a musical comedy and nudged each other at the matrimonial\njokes and the prohibition jokes; they paraded the lobby, arm in arm,\nbetween acts, and in the glee of his first release from the shame which\ndissevers fathers and sons Ted chuckled, \xe2\x80\x9cDad, did you ever hear the one\nabout the three milliners and the judge?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen Ted had returned to Zenith, Babbitt was lonely. As he was trying to\nmake alliance between Offutt and certain Milwaukee interests which\nwanted the race-track plot, most of his time was taken up in waiting for\ntelephone calls.... Sitting on the edge of his bed, holding the portable\ntelephone, asking wearily, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Sagen not in yet? Didn\xe2\x80\x99 he leave any\nmessage for me? All right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll hold the wire.\xe2\x80\x9d Staring at a stain on\nthe wall, reflecting that it resembled a shoe, and being bored by this\ntwentieth discovery that it resembled a shoe. Lighting a cigarette;\nthen, bound to the telephone with no ash-tray in reach, wondering what\nto do with this burning menace and anxiously trying to toss it into the\ntiled bathroom. At last, on the telephone, \xe2\x80\x9cNo message, eh? All right,\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll call up again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOne afternoon he wandered through snow-rutted streets of which he had\nnever heard, streets of small tenements and two-family houses and\nmarooned cottages. It came to him that he had nothing to do, that there\nwas nothing he wanted to do. He was bleakly lonely in the evening, when\nhe dined by himself at the Regency Hotel. He sat in the lobby afterward,\nin a plush chair bedecked with the Saxe-Coburg arms, lighting a cigar\nand looking for some one who would come and play with him and save him\nfrom thinking. In the chair next to him (showing the arms of Lithuania)\nwas a half-familiar man, a large red-faced man with pop eyes and a\ndeficient yellow mustache. He seemed kind and insignificant, and as\nlonely as Babbitt himself. He wore a tweed suit and a reluctant orange\ntie.\n\nIt came to Babbitt with a pyrotechnic crash. The melancholy stranger was\nSir Gerald Doak.\n\nInstinctively Babbitt rose, bumbling, \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99re you, Sir Gerald? \xe2\x80\x99Member\nwe met in Zenith, at Charley McKelvey\xe2\x80\x99s? Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s my name--real\nestate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! How d\xe2\x80\x99you do.\xe2\x80\x9d Sir Gerald shook hands flabbily.\n\nEmbarrassed, standing, wondering how he could retreat, Babbitt\nmaundered, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I suppose you been having a great trip since we saw\nyou in Zenith.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite. British Columbia and California and all over the place,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\ndoubtfully, looking at Babbitt lifelessly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you find business conditions in British Columbia? Or I suppose\nmaybe you didn\xe2\x80\x99t look into \xe2\x80\x99em. Scenery and sport and so on?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cScenery? Oh, capital. But business conditions-- You know, Mr. Babbitt,\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re having almost as much unemployment as we are.\xe2\x80\x9d Sir Gerald was\nspeaking warmly now.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo? Business conditions not so doggone good, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, business conditions weren\xe2\x80\x99t at all what I\xe2\x80\x99d hoped to find them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot good, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not--not really good.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a darn shame. Well-- I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for somebody to\ntake you out to some big shindig, Sir Gerald.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShindig? Oh. Shindig. No, to tell you the truth, I was wondering what\nthe deuce I could do this evening. Don\xe2\x80\x99t know a soul in Tchicahgo. I\nwonder if you happen to know whether there\xe2\x80\x99s a good theater in this\ncity?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood? Why say, they\xe2\x80\x99re running grand opera right now! I guess maybe\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh? Eh? Went to the opera once in London. Covent Garden sort of thing.\nShocking! No, I was wondering if there was a good cinema--movie.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt was sitting down, hitching his chair over, shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cMovie?\nSay, Sir Gerald, I supposed of course you had a raft of dames waiting to\nlead you out to some soir\xc3\xa9e--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c--but if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t, what do you say you and me go to a movie? There\xe2\x80\x99s\na peach of a film at the Grantham: Bill Hart in a bandit picture.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight-o! Just a moment while I get my coat.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSwollen with greatness, slightly afraid lest the noble blood of\nNottingham change its mind and leave him at any street corner, Babbitt\nparaded with Sir Gerald Doak to the movie palace and in silent bliss sat\nbeside him, trying not to be too enthusiastic, lest the knight despise\nhis adoration of six-shooters and broncos. At the end Sir Gerald\nmurmured, \xe2\x80\x9cJolly good picture, this. So awfully decent of you to take\nme. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t enjoyed myself so much for weeks. All these Hostesses--they\nnever let you go to the cinema!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil you say!\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s speech had lost the delicate refinement\nand all the broad A\xe2\x80\x99s with which he had adorned it, and become hearty\nand natural. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m tickled to death you liked it, Sir Gerald.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey crawled past the knees of fat women into the aisle; they stood in\nthe lobby waving their arms in the rite of putting on overcoats. Babbitt\nhinted, \xe2\x80\x9cSay, how about a little something to eat? I know a place where\nwe could get a swell rarebit, and we might dig up a little drink--that\nis, if you ever touch the stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather! But why don\xe2\x80\x99t you come to my room? I\xe2\x80\x99ve some Scotch--not half\nbad.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to use up all your hootch. It\xe2\x80\x99s darn nice of you,\nbut-- You probably want to hit the hay.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSir Gerald was transformed. He was beefily yearning. \xe2\x80\x9cOh really, now; I\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t had a decent evening for so long! Having to go to all these\ndances. No chance to discuss business and that sort of thing. Do be a\ngood chap and come along. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill I? You bet! I just thought maybe-- Say, by golly, it does do a\nfellow good, don\xe2\x80\x99t it, to sit and visit about business conditions, after\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s been to these balls and masquerades and banquets and all that\nsociety stuff. I often feel that way in Zenith. Sure, you bet I\xe2\x80\x99ll\ncome.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s awfully nice of you.\xe2\x80\x9d They beamed along the street. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\nold chap, can you tell me, do American cities always keep up this\ndreadful social pace? All these magnificent parties?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on now, quit your kidding! Gosh, you with court balls and functions\nand everything--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, really, old chap! Mother and I--Lady Doak, I should say, we usually\nplay a hand of bezique and go to bed at ten. Bless my soul, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\nkeep up your beastly pace! And talking! All your American women, they\nknow so much--culture and that sort of thing. This Mrs. McKelvey--your\nfriend--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYuh, old Lucile. Good kid.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c--she asked me which of the galleries I liked best in Florence. Or was\nit in Firenze? Never been in Italy in my life! And primitives. Did I\nlike primitives. Do you know what the deuce a primitive is?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe? I should say not! But I know what a discount for cash is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather! So do I, by George! But primitives!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYuh! Primitives!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey laughed with the sound of a Boosters\xe2\x80\x99 luncheon.\n\nSir Gerald\xe2\x80\x99s room was, except for his ponderous and durable English\nbags, very much like the room of George F. Babbitt; and quite in the\nmanner of Babbitt he disclosed a huge whisky flask, looked proud and\nhospitable, and chuckled, \xe2\x80\x9cSay, when, old chap.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was after the third drink that Sir Gerald proclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you\nYankees get the notion that writing chaps like Bertrand Shaw and this\nWells represent us? The real business England, we think those chaps are\ntraitors. Both our countries have their comic Old Aristocracy--you know,\nold county families, hunting people and all that sort of thing--and we\nboth have our wretched labor leaders, but we both have a backbone of\nsound business men who run the whole show.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet. Here\xe2\x80\x99s to the real guys!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m with you! Here\xe2\x80\x99s to ourselves!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was after the fourth drink that Sir Gerald asked humbly, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you\nthink of North Dakota mortgages?\xe2\x80\x9d but it was not till after the fifth\nthat Babbitt began to call him \xe2\x80\x9cJerry,\xe2\x80\x9d and Sir Gerald confided, \xe2\x80\x9cI say,\ndo you mind if I pull off my boots?\xe2\x80\x9d and ecstatically stretched his\nknightly feet, his poor, tired, hot, swollen feet out on the bed.\n\nAfter the sixth, Babbitt irregularly arose. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I better be hiking\nalong. Jerry, you\xe2\x80\x99re a regular human being! I wish to thunder we\xe2\x80\x99d been\nbetter acquainted in Zenith. Lookit. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you come back and stay with\nme a while?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo sorry--must go to New York to-morrow. Most awfully sorry, old boy. I\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t enjoyed an evening so much since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the States. Real\ntalk. Not all this social rot. I\xe2\x80\x99d never have let them give me the\nbeastly title--and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get it for nothing, eh?--if I\xe2\x80\x99d thought I\xe2\x80\x99d\nhave to talk to women about primitives and polo! Goodish thing to have\nin Nottingham, though; annoyed the mayor most frightfully when I got it;\nand of course the missus likes it. But nobody calls me \xe2\x80\x98Jerry\xe2\x80\x99 now--\xe2\x80\x9d He\nwas almost weeping. \xe2\x80\x9c--and nobody in the States has treated me like a\nfriend till to-night! Good-by, old chap, good-by! Thanks awfully!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mention it, Jerry. And remember whenever you get to Zenith, the\nlatch-string is always out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t forget, old boy, if you ever come to Nottingham, Mother and\nI will be frightfully glad to see you. I shall tell the fellows in\nNottingham your ideas about Visions and Real Guys--at our next Rotary\nClub luncheon.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nIV\n\nBabbitt lay abed at his hotel, imagining the Zenith Athletic Club asking\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of a time d\xe2\x80\x99you have in Chicago?\xe2\x80\x9d and his answering,\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, fair; ran around with Sir Gerald Doak a lot;\xe2\x80\x9d picturing himself\nmeeting Lucile McKelvey and admonishing her, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re all right, Mrs.\nMac, when you aren\xe2\x80\x99t trying to pull this highbrow pose. It\xe2\x80\x99s just as\nGerald Doak says to me in Chicago--oh, yes, Jerry\xe2\x80\x99s an old friend of\nmine--the wife and I are thinking of running over to England to stay\nwith Jerry in his castle, next year--and he said to me, \xe2\x80\x98Georgie, old\nbean, I like Lucile first-rate, but you and me, George, we got to make\nher get over this highty-tighty hooptediddle way she\xe2\x80\x99s got.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut that evening a thing happened which wrecked his pride.\n\n\nV\n\nAt the Regency Hotel cigar-counter he fell to talking with a salesman of\npianos, and they dined together. Babbitt was filled with friendliness\nand well-being. He enjoyed the gorgeousness of the dining-room: the\nchandeliers, the looped brocade curtains, the portraits of French kings\nagainst panels of gilded oak. He enjoyed the crowd: pretty women, good\nsolid fellows who were \xe2\x80\x9cliberal spenders.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe gasped. He stared, and turned away, and stared again. Three tables\noff, with a doubtful sort of woman, a woman at once coy and withered,\nwas Paul Riesling, and Paul was supposed to be in Akron, selling\ntar-roofing. The woman was tapping his hand, mooning at him and\ngiggling. Babbitt felt that he had encountered something involved and\nharmful. Paul was talking with the rapt eagerness of a man who is\ntelling his troubles. He was concentrated on the woman\xe2\x80\x99s faded eyes.\nOnce he held her hand and once, blind to the other guests, he puckered\nhis lips as though he was pretending to kiss her. Babbitt had so strong\nan impulse to go to Paul that he could feel his body uncoiling, his\nshoulders moving, but he felt, desperately, that he must be diplomatic,\nand not till he saw Paul paying the check did he bluster to the\npiano-salesman, \xe2\x80\x9cBy golly--friend of mine over there--\xe2\x80\x99scuse me\nsecond--just say hello to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe touched Paul\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and cried, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, when did you hit town?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPaul glared up at him, face hardening. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, hello, George. Thought you\xe2\x80\x99d\ngone back to Zenith.\xe2\x80\x9d He did not introduce his companion. Babbitt peeped\nat her. She was a flabbily pretty, weakly flirtatious woman of forty-two\nor three, in an atrocious flowery hat. Her rouging was thorough but\nunskilful.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere you staying, Paulibus?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe woman turned, yawned, examined her nails. She seemed accustomed to\nnot being introduced.\n\nPaul grumbled, \xe2\x80\x9cCampbell Inn, on the South Side.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone?\xe2\x80\x9d It sounded insinuating.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! Unfortunately!\xe2\x80\x9d Furiously Paul turned toward the woman, smiling\nwith a fondness sickening to Babbitt. \xe2\x80\x9cMay! Want to introduce you. Mrs.\nArnold, this is my old--acquaintance, George Babbitt.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPleasmeech,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Babbitt, while she gurgled, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m very pleased\nto meet any friend of Mr. Riesling\xe2\x80\x99s, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt demanded, \xe2\x80\x9cBe back there later this evening, Paul? I\xe2\x80\x99ll drop\ndown and see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, better-- We better lunch together to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you to-night, too, Paul. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go down to your\nhotel, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nI\n\nHe sat smoking with the piano-salesman, clinging to the warm refuge of\ngossip, afraid to venture into thoughts of Paul. He was the more affable\non the surface as secretly he became more apprehensive, felt more\nhollow. He was certain that Paul was in Chicago without Zilla\xe2\x80\x99s\nknowledge, and that he was doing things not at all moral and secure.\nWhen the salesman yawned that he had to write up his orders, Babbitt\nleft him, left the hotel, in leisurely calm. But savagely he said\n\xe2\x80\x9cCampbell Inn!\xe2\x80\x9d to the taxi-driver. He sat agitated on the slippery\nleather seat, in that chill dimness which smelled of dust and perfume\nand Turkish cigarettes. He did not heed the snowy lake-front, the dark\nspaces and sudden bright corners in the unknown land south of the Loop.\n\nThe office of the Campbell Inn was hard, bright, new; the night clerk\nharder and brighter. \xe2\x80\x9cYep?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Babbitt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Paul Riesling registered here?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYep.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he in now?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNope.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen if you\xe2\x80\x99ll give me his key, I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t do that, brother. Wait down here if you wanna.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt had spoken with the deference which all the Clan of Good Fellows\ngive to hotel clerks. Now he said with snarling abruptness:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may have to wait some time. I\xe2\x80\x99m Riesling\xe2\x80\x99s brother-in-law. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go up\nto his room. D\xe2\x80\x99 I look like a sneak-thief?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHis voice was low and not pleasant. With considerable haste the clerk\ntook down the key, protesting, \xe2\x80\x9cI never said you looked like a\nsneak-thief. Just rules of the hotel. But if you want to--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn his way up in the elevator Babbitt wondered why he was here. Why\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t Paul be dining with a respectable married woman? Why had he\nlied to the clerk about being Paul\xe2\x80\x99s brother-in-law? He had acted like a\nchild. He must be careful not to say foolish dramatic things to Paul. As\nhe settled down he tried to look pompous and placid. Then the\nthought-- Suicide. He\xe2\x80\x99d been dreading that, without knowing it. Paul\nwould be just the person to do something like that. He must be out of\nhis head or he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be confiding in that--that dried-up hag.\n\nZilla (oh, damn Zilla! how gladly he\xe2\x80\x99d throttle that nagging fiend of a\nwoman!)--she\xe2\x80\x99d probably succeeded at last, and driven Paul crazy.\n\nSuicide. Out there in the lake, way out, beyond the piled ice along the\nshore. It would be ghastly cold to drop into the water to-night.\n\nOr--throat cut--in the bathroom--\n\nBabbitt flung into Paul\xe2\x80\x99s bathroom. It was empty. He smiled, feebly.\n\nHe pulled at his choking collar, looked at his watch, opened the window\nto stare down at the street, looked at his watch, tried to read the\nevening paper lying on the glass-topped bureau, looked again at his\nwatch. Three minutes had gone by since he had first looked at it.\n\nAnd he waited for three hours.\n\nHe was sitting fixed, chilled, when the doorknob turned. Paul came in\nglowering.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello,\xe2\x80\x9d Paul said. \xe2\x80\x9cBeen waiting?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYuh, little while.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell what? Just thought I\xe2\x80\x99d drop in to see how you made out in Akron.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did all right. What difference does it make?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, gosh, Paul, what are you sore about?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you butting into my affairs for?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Paul, that\xe2\x80\x99s no way to talk! I\xe2\x80\x99m not butting into nothing. I was\nso glad to see your ugly old phiz that I just dropped in to say howdy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to have anybody following me around and trying to\nboss me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had all of that I\xe2\x80\x99m going to stand!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, gosh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the way you looked at May Arnold, or the snooty way you\ntalked.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, all right then! If you think I\xe2\x80\x99m a buttinsky, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll just butt\nin! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who your May Arnold is, but I know doggone good and\nwell that you and her weren\xe2\x80\x99t talking about tar-roofing, no, nor about\nplaying the violin, neither! If you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got any moral consideration\nfor yourself, you ought to have some for your position in the community.\nThe idea of your going around places gawping into a female\xe2\x80\x99s eyes like a\nlove-sick pup! I can understand a fellow slipping once, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t\npropose to see a fellow that\xe2\x80\x99s been as chummy with me as you have\ngetting started on the downward path and sneaking off from his wife,\neven as cranky a one as Zilla, to go woman-chasing--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99re a perfectly moral little husband!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am, by God! I\xe2\x80\x99ve never looked at any woman except Myra since I\xe2\x80\x99ve\nbeen married--practically--and I never will! I tell you there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\nto immorality. It don\xe2\x80\x99t pay. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you see, old man, it just makes Zilla\nstill crankier?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSlight of resolution as he was of body, Paul threw his snow-beaded\novercoat on the floor and crouched on a flimsy cane chair. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99re\nan old blowhard, and you know less about morality than Tinka, but you\xe2\x80\x99re\nall right, Georgie. But you can\xe2\x80\x99t understand that-- I\xe2\x80\x99m through. I can\xe2\x80\x99t\ngo Zilla\xe2\x80\x99s hammering any longer. She\xe2\x80\x99s made up her mind that I\xe2\x80\x99m a\ndevil, and-- Reg\xe2\x80\x99lar Inquisition. Torture. She enjoys it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a game to\nsee how sore she can make me. And me, either it\xe2\x80\x99s find a little\ncomfort, any comfort, anywhere, or else do something a lot worse. Now\nthis Mrs. Arnold, she\xe2\x80\x99s not so young, but she\xe2\x80\x99s a fine woman and she\nunderstands a fellow, and she\xe2\x80\x99s had her own troubles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea! I suppose she\xe2\x80\x99s one of these hens whose husband \xe2\x80\x98doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\nunderstand her\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Maybe. He was killed in the war.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt lumbered up, stood beside Paul patting his shoulder, making soft\napologetic noises.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonest, George, she\xe2\x80\x99s a fine woman, and she\xe2\x80\x99s had one hell of a time.\nWe manage to jolly each other up a lot. We tell each other we\xe2\x80\x99re the\ndandiest pair on earth. Maybe we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it, but it helps a lot to\nhave somebody with whom you can be perfectly simple, and not all this\ndiscussing--explaining--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s as far as you go?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not! Go on! Say it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t-- I can\xe2\x80\x99t say I like it, but--\xe2\x80\x9d With a burst which left\nhim feeling large and shining with generosity, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s none of my darn\nbusiness! I\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything I can for you, if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything I can do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere might be. I judge from Zilla\xe2\x80\x99s letters that\xe2\x80\x99ve been forwarded\nfrom Akron that she\xe2\x80\x99s getting suspicious about my staying away so long.\nShe\xe2\x80\x99d be perfectly capable of having me shadowed, and of coming to\nChicago and busting into a hotel dining-room and bawling me out before\neverybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of Zilla. I\xe2\x80\x99ll hand her a good fairy-story when I get\nback to Zenith.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know-- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you better try it. You\xe2\x80\x99re a good fellow,\nbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that diplomacy is your strong point.\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt looked\nhurt, then irritated. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean with women! With women, I mean. Course\nthey got to go some to beat you in business diplomacy, but I just mean\nwith women. Zilla may do a lot of rough talking, but she\xe2\x80\x99s pretty\nshrewd. She\xe2\x80\x99d have the story out of you in no time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, all right, but--\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt was still pathetic at not being allowed\nto play Secret Agent. Paul soothed:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourse maybe you might tell her you\xe2\x80\x99d been in Akron and seen me there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, sure, you bet! Don\xe2\x80\x99t I have to go look at that candy-store\nproperty in Akron? Don\xe2\x80\x99t I? Ain\xe2\x80\x99t it a shame I have to stop off there\nwhen I\xe2\x80\x99m so anxious to get home? Ain\xe2\x80\x99t it a regular shame? I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it\nis! I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it\xe2\x80\x99s a doggone shame!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine. But for glory hallelujah\xe2\x80\x99s sake don\xe2\x80\x99t go putting any fancy\nfixings on the story. When men lie they always try to make it too\nartistic, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why women get suspicious. And-- Let\xe2\x80\x99s have a drink,\nGeorgie. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some gin and a little vermouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Paul who normally refused a second cocktail took a second now, and a\nthird. He became red-eyed and thick-tongued. He was embarrassingly\njocular and salacious.\n\nIn the taxicab Babbitt incredulously found tears crowding into his eyes.\n\n\nII\n\nHe had not told Paul of his plan but he did stop at Akron, between\ntrains, for the one purpose of sending to Zilla a post-card with \xe2\x80\x9cHad to\ncome here for the day, ran into Paul.\xe2\x80\x9d In Zenith he called on her. If\nfor public appearances Zilla was over-coiffed, over-painted, and\nresolutely corseted, for private misery she wore a filthy blue\ndressing-gown and torn stockings thrust into streaky pink satin mules.\nHer face was sunken. She seemed to have but half as much hair as Babbitt\nremembered, and that half was stringy. She sat in a rocker amid a debris\nof candy-boxes and cheap magazines, and she sounded dolorous when she\ndid not sound derisive. But Babbitt was exceedingly breezy:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, Zil, old dear, having a good loaf while hubby\xe2\x80\x99s away?\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the idea! I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet a hat Myra never got up till ten, while I was\nin Chicago. Say, could I borrow your thermos--just dropped in to see if\nI could borrow your thermos bottle. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a toboggan\nparty--want to take some coffee _mit_. Oh, did you get my card from\nAkron, saying I\xe2\x80\x99d run into Paul?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. What was he doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d He unbuttoned his overcoat, sat tentatively on the\narm of a chair.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know how I mean!\xe2\x80\x9d She slapped the pages of a magazine with an\nirritable clatter. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose he was trying to make love to some hotel\nwaitress or manicure girl or somebody.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang it, you\xe2\x80\x99re always letting on that Paul goes round chasing skirts.\nHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, in the first place, and if he did, it would prob\xe2\x80\x99ly be\nbecause you keep hinting at him and dinging at him so much. I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\nmeant to, Zilla, but since Paul is away, in Akron--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe really is in Akron? I know he has some horrible woman that he writes\nto in Chicago.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you I saw him in Akron? What \xe2\x80\x99re you trying to do? Make\nme out a liar?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I just-- I get so worried.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, there you are! That\xe2\x80\x99s what gets me! Here you love Paul, and yet\nyou plague him and cuss him out as if you hated him. I simply can\xe2\x80\x99t\nunderstand why it is that the more some folks love people, the harder\nthey try to make \xe2\x80\x99em miserable.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou love Ted and Rone-- I suppose--and yet you nag them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh. Well. That. That\xe2\x80\x99s different. Besides, I don\xe2\x80\x99t nag \xe2\x80\x99em. Not what\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d call nagging. But zize saying: Now, here\xe2\x80\x99s Paul, the nicest, most\nsensitive critter on God\xe2\x80\x99s green earth. You ought to be ashamed of\nyourself the way you pan him. Why, you talk to him like a washerwoman.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m surprised you can act so doggone common, Zilla!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe brooded over her linked fingers. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know. I do go and get mean\nsometimes, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry afterwards. But, oh, Georgie, Paul is so\naggravating! Honestly, I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried awfully hard, these last few years, to\nbe nice to him, but just because I used to be spiteful--or I seemed so;\nI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, really, but I used to speak up and say anything that came into\nmy head--and so he made up his mind that everything was my fault.\nEverything can\xe2\x80\x99t always be my fault, can it? And now if I get to\nfussing, he just turns silent, oh, so dreadfully silent, and he won\xe2\x80\x99t\nlook at me--he just ignores me. He simply isn\xe2\x80\x99t human! And he\ndeliberately keeps it up till I bust out and say a lot of things I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nmean. So silent-- Oh, you righteous men! How wicked you are! How rotten\nwicked!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey thrashed things over and over for half an hour. At the end, weeping\ndrably, Zilla promised to restrain herself.\n\nPaul returned four days later, and the Babbitts and Rieslings went\nfestively to the movies and had chop suey at a Chinese restaurant. As\nthey walked to the restaurant through a street of tailor shops and\nbarber shops, the two wives in front, chattering about cooks, Babbitt\nmurmured to Paul, \xe2\x80\x9cZil seems a lot nicer now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she has been, except once or twice. But it\xe2\x80\x99s too late now. I\njust-- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to discuss it, but I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of her. There\xe2\x80\x99s\nnothing left. I don\xe2\x80\x99t ever want to see her. Some day I\xe2\x80\x99m going to break\naway from her. Somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nThe International Organization of Boosters\xe2\x80\x99 Clubs has become a\nworld-force for optimism, manly pleasantry, and good business. Chapters\nare to be found now in thirty countries. Nine hundred and twenty of the\nthousand chapters, however, are in the United States.\n\nNone of these is more ardent than the Zenith Boosters\xe2\x80\x99 Club.\n\nThe second March lunch of the Zenith Boosters was the most important of\nthe year, as it was to be followed by the annual election of officers.\nThere was agitation abroad. The lunch was held in the ballroom of the\nO\xe2\x80\x99Hearn House. As each of the four hundred Boosters entered he took from\na wallboard a huge celluloid button announcing his name, his nickname,\nand his business. There was a fine of ten cents for calling a Fellow\nBooster by anything but his nickname at a lunch, and as Babbitt jovially\nchecked his hat the air was radiant with shouts of \xe2\x80\x9cHello, Chet!\xe2\x80\x9d and\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99re you, Shorty!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cTop o\xe2\x80\x99 the mornin\xe2\x80\x99, Mac!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey sat at friendly tables for eight, choosing places by lot. Babbitt\nwas with Albert Boos the merchant tailor, Hector Seybolt of the Little\nSweetheart Condensed Milk Company, Emil Wengert the jeweler, Professor\nPumphrey of the Riteway Business College, Dr. Walter Gorbutt, Roy\nTeegarten the photographer, and Ben Berkey the photo-engraver. One of\nthe merits of the Boosters\xe2\x80\x99 Club was that only two persons from each\ndepartment of business were permitted to join, so that you at once\nencountered the Ideals of other occupations, and realized the\nmetaphysical oneness of all occupations--plumbing and portrait-painting,\nmedicine and the manufacture of chewing-gum.\n\nBabbitt\xe2\x80\x99s table was particularly happy to-day, because Professor\nPumphrey had just had a birthday, and was therefore open to teasing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s pump Pump about how old he is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Emil Wengert.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, let\xe2\x80\x99s paddle him with a dancing-pump!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben Berkey.\n\nBut it was Babbitt who had the applause, with \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk about pumps to\nthat guy! The only pump he knows is a bottle! Honest, they tell me he\xe2\x80\x99s\nstarting a class in home-brewing at the ole college!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt each place was the Boosters\xe2\x80\x99 Club booklet, listing the members.\nThough the object of the club was good-fellowship, yet they never lost\nsight of the importance of doing a little more business. After each name\nwas the member\xe2\x80\x99s occupation. There were scores of advertisements in the\nbooklet, and on one page the admonition: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no rule that you have\nto trade with your Fellow Boosters, but get wise, boy--what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of\nletting all this good money get outside of our happy fambly?\xe2\x80\x9d And at\neach place, to-day, there was a present; a card printed in artistic red\nand black:\n\n                        SERVICE AND BOOSTERISM\n\n     Service finds its finest opportunity and development only in its\n     broadest and deepest application and the consideration of its\n     perpetual action upon reaction. I believe the highest type of\n     Service, like the most progressive tenets of ethics, senses\n     unceasingly and is motived by active adherence and loyalty to that\n     which is the essential principle of Boosterism--Good Citizenship in\n     all its factors and aspects.\n\n                                                          DAD PETERSEN.\n\n           Compliments of Dadbury Petersen Advertising Corp.\n\n                       \xe2\x80\x9cAds, not Fads, at Dad\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe Boosters all read Mr. Peterson\xe2\x80\x99s aphorism and said they understood\nit perfectly.\n\nThe meeting opened with the regular weekly \xe2\x80\x9cstunts.\xe2\x80\x9d Retiring President\nVergil Gunch was in the chair, his stiff hair like a hedge, his voice\nlike a brazen gong of festival. Members who had brought guests\nintroduced them publicly. \xe2\x80\x9cThis tall red-headed piece of misinformation\nis the sporting editor of the _Press_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Willis Ijams; and H. H.\nHazen, the druggist, chanted, \xe2\x80\x9cBoys, when you\xe2\x80\x99re on a long motor tour\nand finally get to a romantic spot or scene and draw up and remark to\nthe wife, \xe2\x80\x98This is certainly a romantic place,\xe2\x80\x99 it sends a glow right up\nand down your vertebr\xc3\xa6. Well, my guest to-day is from such a place,\nHarper\xe2\x80\x99s Ferry, Virginia, in the beautiful Southland, with memories of\ngood old General Robert E. Lee and of that brave soul, John Brown who,\nlike every good Booster, goes marching on--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere were two especially distinguished guests: the leading man of the\n\xe2\x80\x9cBird of Paradise\xe2\x80\x9d company, playing this week at the Dodsworth Theater,\nand the mayor of Zenith, the Hon. Lucas Prout.\n\nVergil Gunch thundered, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we manage to grab this celebrated Thespian\noff his lovely aggregation of beautiful actresses--and I got to admit I\nbutted right into his dressing-room and told him how the Boosters\nappreciated the high-class artistic performance he\xe2\x80\x99s giving us--and\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t forget that the treasurer of the Dodsworth is a Booster and will\nappreciate our patronage--and when on top of that we yank Hizzonor out\nof his multifarious duties at City Hall, then I feel we\xe2\x80\x99ve done\nourselves proud, and Mr. Prout will now say a few words about the\nproblems and duties--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBy rising vote the Boosters decided which was the handsomest and which\nthe ugliest guest, and to each of them was given a bunch of carnations,\ndonated, President Gunch noted, by Brother Booster H. G. Yeager, the\nJennifer Avenue florist.\n\nEach week, in rotation, four Boosters were privileged to obtain the\npleasures of generosity and of publicity by donating goods or services\nto four fellow-members, chosen by lot. There was laughter, this week,\nwhen it was announced that one of the contributors was Barnabas Joy, the\nundertaker. Everybody whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cI can think of a coupla good guys to\nbe buried if his donation is a free funeral!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThrough all these diversions the Boosters were lunching on chicken\ncroquettes, peas, fried potatoes, coffee, apple pie, and American\ncheese. Gunch did not lump the speeches. Presently he called on the\nvisiting secretary of the Zenith Rotary Club, a rival organization. The\nsecretary had the distinction of possessing State Motor Car License\nNumber 5.\n\nThe Rotary secretary laughingly admitted that wherever he drove in the\nstate so low a number created a sensation, and \xe2\x80\x9cthough it was pretty\nnice to have the honor, yet traffic cops remembered it only too darn\nwell, and sometimes he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know but what he\xe2\x80\x99d almost as soon have\njust plain B56,876 or something like that. Only let any doggone Booster\ntry to get Number 5 away from a live Rotarian next year, and watch the\nfur fly! And if they\xe2\x80\x99d permit him, he\xe2\x80\x99d wind up by calling for a cheer\nfor the Boosters and Rotarians and the Kiwanis all together!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt sighed to Professor Pumphrey, \xe2\x80\x9cBe pretty nice to have as low a\nnumber as that! Everybody\xe2\x80\x99d say, \xe2\x80\x98He must be an important guy!\xe2\x80\x99 Wonder\nhow he got it? I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet he wined and dined the superintendent of the\nMotor License Bureau to a fare-you-well!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen Chum Frink addressed them:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of you may feel that it\xe2\x80\x99s out of place here to talk on a strictly\nhighbrow and artistic subject, but I want to come out flatfooted and ask\nyou boys to O.K. the proposition of a Symphony Orchestra for Zenith.\nNow, where a lot of you make your mistake is in assuming that if you\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like classical music and all that junk, you ought to oppose it.\nNow, I want to confess that, though I\xe2\x80\x99m a literary guy by profession, I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care a rap for all this long-haired music. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather listen to a\ngood jazz band any time than to some piece by Beethoven that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t any\nmore tune to it than a bunch of fighting cats, and you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t whistle\nit to save your life! But that isn\xe2\x80\x99t the point. Culture has become as\nnecessary an adornment and advertisement for a city to-day as pavements\nor bank-clearances. It\xe2\x80\x99s Culture, in theaters and art-galleries and so\non, that brings thousands of visitors to New York every year and, to be\nfrank, for all our splendid attainments we haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet got the Culture\nof a New York or Chicago or Boston--or at least we don\xe2\x80\x99t get the credit\nfor it. The thing to do then, as a live bunch of go-getters, is to\n_capitalize Culture_; to go right out and grab it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPictures and books are fine for those that have the time to study \xe2\x80\x99em,\nbut they don\xe2\x80\x99t shoot out on the road and holler \xe2\x80\x98This is what little old\nZenith can put up in the way of Culture.\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s precisely what a\nSymphony Orchestra does do. Look at the credit Minneapolis and\nCincinnati get. An orchestra with first-class musickers and a swell\nconductor--and I believe we ought to do the thing up brown and get one\nof the highest-paid conductors on the market, providing he ain\xe2\x80\x99t a\nHun--it goes right into Beantown and New York and Washington; it plays\nat the best theaters to the most cultured and moneyed people; it gives\nsuch class-advertising as a town can get in no other way; and the guy\nwho is so short-sighted as to crab this orchestra proposition is passing\nup the chance to impress the glorious name of Zenith on some big New\nYork millionaire that might--that might establish a branch factory here!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could also go into the fact that for our daughters who show an\ninterest in highbrow music and may want to teach it, having an A1 local\norganization is of great benefit, but let\xe2\x80\x99s keep this on a practical\nbasis, and I call on you good brothers to whoop it up for Culture and a\nWorld-beating Symphony Orchestra!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey applauded.\n\nTo a rustle of excitement President Gunch proclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, we\nwill now proceed to the annual election of officers.\xe2\x80\x9d For each of the\nsix offices, three candidates had been chosen by a committee. The second\nname among the candidates for vice-president was Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\nHe was surprised. He looked self-conscious. His heart pounded. He was\nstill more agitated when the ballots were counted and Gunch said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\na pleasure to announce that Georgie Babbitt will be the next assistant\ngavel-wielder. I know of no man who stands more stanchly for common\nsense and enterprise than good old George. Come on, let\xe2\x80\x99s give him our\nbest long yell!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs they adjourned, a hundred men crushed in to slap his back. He had\nnever known a higher moment. He drove away in a blur of wonder. He\nlunged into his office, chuckling to Miss McGoun, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I guess you\nbetter congratulate your boss! Been elected vice-president of the\nBoosters!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe was disappointed. She answered only, \xe2\x80\x9cYes-- Oh, Mrs. Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s been\ntrying to get you on the \xe2\x80\x99phone.\xe2\x80\x9d But the new salesman, Fritz Weilinger,\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cBy golly, chief, say, that\xe2\x80\x99s great, that\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly great! I\xe2\x80\x99m\ntickled to death! Congratulations!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt called the house, and crowed to his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cHeard you were trying\nto get me, Myra. Say, you got to hand it to little Georgie, this time!\nBetter talk careful! You are now addressing the vice-president of the\nBoosters\xe2\x80\x99 Club!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Georgie--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty nice, huh? Willis Ijams is the new president, but when he\xe2\x80\x99s\naway, little ole Georgie takes the gavel and whoops \xe2\x80\x99em up and\nintroduces the speakers--no matter if they\xe2\x80\x99re the governor\nhimself--and--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge! Listen!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c--it puts him in solid with big men like Doc Dilling and--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge! Paul Riesling--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sure, I\xe2\x80\x99ll \xe2\x80\x99phone Paul and let him know about it right away.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorgie! _Listen!_ Paul\xe2\x80\x99s in jail. He shot his wife, he shot Zilla,\nthis noon. She may not live.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\nI\n\nHe drove to the City Prison, not blindly, but with unusual fussy care at\ncorners, the fussiness of an old woman potting plants. It kept him from\nfacing the obscenity of fate.\n\nThe attendant said, \xe2\x80\x9cNaw, you can\xe2\x80\x99t see any of the prisoners till\nthree-thirty--visiting-hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was three. For half an hour Babbitt sat looking at a calendar and a\nclock on a whitewashed wall. The chair was hard and mean and creaky.\nPeople went through the office and, he thought, stared at him. He felt a\nbelligerent defiance which broke into a wincing fear of this machine\nwhich was grinding Paul--Paul--\n\nExactly at half-past three he sent in his name.\n\nThe attendant returned with \xe2\x80\x9cRiesling says he don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re crazy! You didn\xe2\x80\x99t give him my name! Tell him it\xe2\x80\x99s George wants\nto see him, George Babbitt.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYuh, I told him, all right, all right! He said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen take me in anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing doing. If you ain\xe2\x80\x99t his lawyer, if he don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see you,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all there is to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my _God_-- Say, let me see the warden.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s busy. Come on, now, you--\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt reared over him. The attendant\nhastily changed to a coaxing \xe2\x80\x9cYou can come back and try to-morrow.\nProbably the poor guy is off his nut.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt drove, not at all carefully or fussily, sliding viciously past\ntrucks, ignoring the truckmen\xe2\x80\x99s curses, to the City Hall; he stopped\nwith a grind of wheels against the curb, and ran up the marble steps to\nthe office of the Hon. Mr. Lucas Prout, the mayor. He bribed the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s\ndoorman with a dollar; he was instantly inside, demanding, \xe2\x80\x9cYou remember\nme, Mr. Prout? Babbitt--vice-president of the Boosters--campaigned for\nyou? Say, have you heard about poor Riesling? Well, I want an order on\nthe warden or whatever you call um of the City Prison to take me back\nand see him. Good. Thanks.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn fifteen minutes he was pounding down the prison corridor to a cage\nwhere Paul Riesling sat on a cot, twisted like an old beggar, legs\ncrossed, arms in a knot, biting at his clenched fist.\n\nPaul looked up blankly as the keeper unlocked the cell, admitted\nBabbitt, and left them together. He spoke slowly: \xe2\x80\x9cGo on! Be moral!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt plumped on the couch beside him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be moral! I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care what happened! I just want to do anything I can. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad\nZilla got what was coming to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPaul said argumentatively, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t go jumping on Zilla. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\nthinking; maybe she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had any too easy a time. Just after I shot\nher-- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly mean to, but she got to deviling me so I went\ncrazy, just for a second, and pulled out that old revolver you and I\nused to shoot rabbits with, and took a crack at her. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly mean\nto-- After that, when I was trying to stop the blood-- It was terrible\nwhat it did to her shoulder, and she had beautiful skin-- Maybe she won\xe2\x80\x99t\ndie. I hope it won\xe2\x80\x99t leave her skin all scarred. But just afterward,\nwhen I was hunting through the bathroom for some cotton to stop the\nblood, I ran onto a little fuzzy yellow duck we hung on the tree one\nChristmas, and I remembered she and I\xe2\x80\x99d been awfully happy then-- Hell. I\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t hardly believe it\xe2\x80\x99s me here.\xe2\x80\x9d As Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s arm tightened about his\nshoulder, Paul sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad you came. But I thought maybe you\xe2\x80\x99d\nlecture me, and when you\xe2\x80\x99ve committed a murder, and been brought here\nand everything--there was a big crowd outside the apartment house, all\nstaring, and the cops took me through it-- Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to talk\nabout it any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut he went on, in a monotonous, terrified insane mumble. To divert him\nBabbitt said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you got a scar on your cheek.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. That\xe2\x80\x99s where the cop hit me. I suppose cops get a lot of fun out\nof lecturing murderers, too. He was a big fellow. And they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let\nme help carry Zilla down to the ambulance.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPaul! Quit it! Listen: she won\xe2\x80\x99t die, and when it\xe2\x80\x99s all over you and\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll go off to Maine again. And maybe we can get that May Arnold to go\nalong. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go up to Chicago and ask her. Good woman, by golly. And\nafterwards I\xe2\x80\x99ll see that you get started in business out West somewhere,\nmaybe Seattle--they say that\xe2\x80\x99s a lovely city.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPaul was half smiling. It was Babbitt who rambled now. He could not tell\nwhether Paul was heeding, but he droned on till the coming of Paul\xe2\x80\x99s\nlawyer, P. J. Maxwell, a thin, busy, unfriendly man who nodded at\nBabbitt and hinted, \xe2\x80\x9cIf Riesling and I could be alone for a moment--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt wrung Paul\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and waited in the office till Maxwell came\npattering out. \xe2\x80\x9cLook, old man, what can I do?\xe2\x80\x9d he begged.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. Not a thing. Not just now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maxwell. \xe2\x80\x9cSorry. Got to\nhurry. And don\xe2\x80\x99t try to see him. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had the doctor give him a shot of\nmorphine, so he\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt seemed somehow wicked to return to the office. Babbitt felt as though\nhe had just come from a funeral. He drifted out to the City Hospital to\ninquire about Zilla. She was not likely to die, he learned. The bullet\nfrom Paul\xe2\x80\x99s huge old .44 army revolver had smashed her shoulder and torn\nupward and out.\n\nHe wandered home and found his wife radiant with the horrified interest\nwe have in the tragedies of our friends. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course Paul isn\xe2\x80\x99t\naltogether to blame, but this is what comes of his chasing after other\nwomen instead of bearing his cross in a Christian way,\xe2\x80\x9d she exulted.\n\nHe was too languid to respond as he desired. He said what was to be said\nabout the Christian bearing of crosses, and went out to clean the car.\nDully, patiently, he scraped linty grease from the drip-pan, gouged at\nthe mud caked on the wheels. He used up many minutes in washing his\nhands; scoured them with gritty kitchen soap; rejoiced in hurting his\nplump knuckles. \xe2\x80\x9cDamn soft hands--like a woman\xe2\x80\x99s. Aah!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt dinner, when his wife began the inevitable, he bellowed, \xe2\x80\x9cI forbid\nany of you to say a word about Paul! I\xe2\x80\x99ll \xe2\x80\x99tend to all the talking about\nthis that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary, hear me? There\xe2\x80\x99s going to be one house in this\nscandal-mongering town to-night that isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to spring the\nholier-than-thou. And throw those filthy evening papers out of the\nhouse!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut he himself read the papers, after dinner.\n\nBefore nine he set out for the house of Lawyer Maxwell. He was received\nwithout cordiality. \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maxwell.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to offer my services in the trial. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got an idea. Why\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I go on the stand and swear I was there, and she pulled the gun\nfirst and he wrestled with her and the gun went off accidentally?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd perjure yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh? Yes, I suppose it would be perjury. Oh-- Would it help?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear fellow! Perjury!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t be a fool! Excuse me, Maxwell; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to get your\ngoat. I just mean: I\xe2\x80\x99ve known and you\xe2\x80\x99ve known many and many a case of\nperjury, just to annex some rotten little piece of real estate, and here\nwhere it\xe2\x80\x99s a case of saving Paul from going to prison, I\xe2\x80\x99d perjure\nmyself black in the face.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Aside from the ethics of the matter, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\npracticable. The prosecutor would tear your testimony to pieces. It\xe2\x80\x99s\nknown that only Riesling and his wife were there at the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, look here! Let me go on the stand and swear--and this would be\nthe God\xe2\x80\x99s truth--that she pestered him till he kind of went crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Sorry. Riesling absolutely refuses to have any testimony reflecting\non his wife. He insists on pleading guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen let me get up and testify something--whatever you say. Let me do\n_something_!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Babbitt, but the best thing you can do-- I hate to say it,\nbut you could help us most by keeping strictly out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt, revolving his hat like a defaulting poor tenant, winced so\nvisibly that Maxwell condescended:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to hurt your feelings, but you see we both want to do our\nbest for Riesling, and we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t consider any other factor. The trouble\nwith you, Babbitt, is that you\xe2\x80\x99re one of these fellows who talk too\nreadily. You like to hear your own voice. If there were anything for\nwhich I could put you in the witness-box, you\xe2\x80\x99d get going and give the\nwhole show away. Sorry. Now I must look over some papers-- So sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nII\n\nHe spent most of the next morning nerving himself to face the garrulous\nworld of the Athletic Club. They would talk about Paul; they would be\nlip-licking and rotten. But at the Roughnecks\xe2\x80\x99 Table they did not\nmention Paul. They spoke with zeal of the coming baseball season. He\nloved them as he never had before.\n\n\nIII\n\nHe had, doubtless from some story-book, pictured Paul\xe2\x80\x99s trial as a long\nstruggle, with bitter arguments, a taut crowd, and sudden and\noverwhelming new testimony. Actually, the trial occupied less than\nfifteen minutes, largely filled with the evidence of doctors that Zilla\nwould recover and that Paul must have been temporarily insane. Next day\nPaul was sentenced to three years in the State Penitentiary and taken\noff--quite undramatically, not handcuffed, merely plodding in a tired\nway beside a cheerful deputy sheriff--and after saying good-by to him at\nthe station Babbitt returned to his office to realize that he faced a\nworld which, without Paul, was meaningless.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nI\n\nHe was busy, from March to June. He kept himself from the bewilderment\nof thinking. His wife and the neighbors were generous. Every evening he\nplayed bridge or attended the movies, and the days were blank of face\nand silent.\n\nIn June, Mrs. Babbitt and Tinka went East, to stay with relatives, and\nBabbitt was free to do--he was not quite sure what.\n\nAll day long after their departure he thought of the emancipated house\nin which he could, if he desired, go mad and curse the gods without\nhaving to keep up a husbandly front. He considered, \xe2\x80\x9cI could have a\nreg\xe2\x80\x99lar party to-night; stay out till two and not do any explaining\nafterwards. Cheers!\xe2\x80\x9d He telephoned to Vergil Gunch, to Eddie Swanson.\nBoth of them were engaged for the evening, and suddenly he was bored by\nhaving to take so much trouble to be riotous.\n\nHe was silent at dinner, unusually kindly to Ted and Verona, hesitating\nbut not disapproving when Verona stated her opinion of Kenneth Escott\xe2\x80\x99s\nopinion of Dr. John Jennison Drew\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of the opinions of the\nevolutionists. Ted was working in a garage through the summer vacation,\nand he related his daily triumphs: how he had found a cracked ball-race,\nwhat he had said to the Old Grouch, what he had said to the foreman\nabout the future of wireless telephony.\n\nTed and Verona went to a dance after dinner. Even the maid was out.\nRarely had Babbitt been alone in the house for an entire evening. He was\nrestless. He vaguely wanted something more diverting than the newspaper\ncomic strips to read. He ambled up to Verona\xe2\x80\x99s room, sat on her\nmaidenly blue and white bed, humming and grunting in a solid-citizen\nmanner as he examined her books: Conrad\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cRescue,\xe2\x80\x9d a volume strangely\nnamed \xe2\x80\x9cFigures of Earth,\xe2\x80\x9d poetry (quite irregular poetry, Babbitt\nthought) by Vachel Lindsay, and essays by H. L. Mencken--highly improper\nessays, making fun of the church and all the decencies. He liked none of\nthe books. In them he felt a spirit of rebellion against niceness and\nsolid-citizenship. These authors--and he supposed they were famous ones,\ntoo--did not seem to care about telling a good story which would enable\na fellow to forget his troubles. He sighed. He noted a book, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Three\nBlack Pennies,\xe2\x80\x9d by Joseph Hergesheimer. Ah, that was something like it!\nIt would be an adventure story, maybe about counterfeiting--detectives\nsneaking up on the old house at night. He tucked the book under his arm,\nhe clumped down-stairs and solemnly began to read, under the piano-lamp:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA twilight like blue dust sifted into the shallow fold of the thickly\nwooded hills. It was early October, but a crisping frost had already\nstamped the maple trees with gold, the Spanish oaks were hung with\npatches of wine red, the sumach was brilliant in the darkening\nunderbrush. A pattern of wild geese, flying low and unconcerned above\nthe hills, wavered against the serene ashen evening. Howat Penny,\nstanding in the comparative clearing of a road, decided that the\nshifting regular flight would not come close enough for a shot.... He\nhad no intention of hunting the geese. With the drooping of day his\nkeenness had evaporated; an habitual indifference strengthened,\npermeating him....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere it was again: discontent with the good common ways. Babbitt laid\ndown the book and listened to the stillness. The inner doors of the\nhouse were open. He heard from the kitchen the steady drip of the\nrefrigerator, a rhythm demanding and disquieting. He roamed to the\nwindow. The summer evening was foggy and, seen through the wire screen,\nthe street lamps were crosses of pale fire. The whole world was\nabnormal. While he brooded, Verona and Ted came in and went up to bed.\nSilence thickened in the sleeping house. He put on his hat, his\nrespectable derby, lighted a cigar, and walked up and down before the\nhouse, a portly, worthy, unimaginative figure, humming \xe2\x80\x9cSilver Threads\namong the Gold.\xe2\x80\x9d He casually considered, \xe2\x80\x9cMight call up Paul.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he\nremembered. He saw Paul in a jailbird\xe2\x80\x99s uniform, but while he agonized\nhe didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe the tale. It was part of the unreality of this\nfog-enchanted evening.\n\nIf she were here Myra would be hinting, \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it late, Georgie?\xe2\x80\x9d He\ntramped in forlorn and unwanted freedom. Fog hid the house now. The\nworld was uncreated, a chaos without turmoil or desire.\n\nThrough the mist came a man at so feverish a pace that he seemed to\ndance with fury as he entered the orb of glow from a street-lamp. At\neach step he brandished his stick and brought it down with a crash. His\nglasses on their broad pretentious ribbon banged against his stomach.\nBabbitt incredulously saw that it was Chum Frink.\n\nFrink stopped, focused his vision, and spoke with gravity:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s another fool. George Babbitt. Lives for renting\nhowshes--houses. Know who I am? I\xe2\x80\x99m traitor to poetry. I\xe2\x80\x99m drunk. I\xe2\x80\x99m\ntalking too much. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. Know what I could\xe2\x80\x99ve been? I could\xe2\x80\x99ve\nbeen a Gene Field or a James Whitcomb Riley. Maybe a Stevenson. I\ncould\xe2\x80\x99ve. Whimsies. \xe2\x80\x99Magination. Lissen. Lissen to this. Just made it\nup:\n\n    Glittering summery meadowy noise\n    Of beetles and bums and respectable boys.\n\nHear that? Whimzh--whimsy. I made that up. _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it means!\nBeginning good verse. Chile\xe2\x80\x99s Garden Verses. And whadi write? Tripe!\nCheer-up poems. All tripe! Could have written-- Too late!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe darted on with an alarming plunge, seeming always to pitch forward\nyet never quite falling. Babbitt would have been no more astonished and\nno less had a ghost skipped out of the fog carrying his head. He\naccepted Frink with vast apathy; he grunted, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor boob!\xe2\x80\x9d and\nstraightway forgot him.\n\nHe plodded into the house, deliberately went to the refrigerator and\nrifled it. When Mrs. Babbitt was at home, this was one of the major\nhousehold crimes. He stood before the covered laundry tubs, eating a\nchicken leg and half a saucer of raspberry jelly, and grumbling over a\nclammy cold boiled potato. He was thinking. It was coming to him that\nperhaps all life as he knew it and vigorously practised it was futile;\nthat heaven as portrayed by the Reverend Dr. John Jennison Drew was\nneither probable nor very interesting; that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t much pleasure out\nof making money; that it was of doubtful worth to rear children merely\nthat they might rear children who would rear children. What was it all\nabout? What did he want?\n\nHe blundered into the living-room, lay on the davenport, hands behind\nhis head.\n\nWhat did he want? Wealth? Social position? Travel? Servants? Yes, but\nonly incidentally.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give it up,\xe2\x80\x9d he sighed.\n\nBut he did know that he wanted the presence of Paul Riesling; and from\nthat he stumbled into the admission that he wanted the fairy girl--in\nthe flesh. If there had been a woman whom he loved, he would have fled\nto her, humbled his forehead on her knees.\n\nHe thought of his stenographer, Miss McGoun. He thought of the prettiest\nof the manicure girls at the Hotel Thornleigh barber shop. As he fell\nasleep on the davenport he felt that he had found something in life, and\nthat he had made a terrifying, thrilling break with everything that was\ndecent and normal.\n\n\nII\n\nHe had forgotten, next morning, that he was a conscious rebel, but he\nwas irritable in the office and at the eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock drive of telephone\ncalls and visitors he did something he had often desired and never\ndared: he left the office without excuses to those slave-drivers his\nemployees, and went to the movies. He enjoyed the right to be alone. He\ncame out with a vicious determination to do what he pleased.\n\nAs he approached the Roughnecks\xe2\x80\x99 Table at the club, everybody laughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, here\xe2\x80\x99s the millionaire!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sidney Finkelstein.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I saw him in his Locomobile!\xe2\x80\x9d said Professor Pumphrey.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGosh, it must be great to be a smart guy like Georgie!\xe2\x80\x9d moaned Vergil\nGunch. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s probably stolen all of Dorchester. I\xe2\x80\x99d hate to leave a poor\nlittle defenseless piece of property lying around where he could get his\nhooks on it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey had, Babbitt perceived, \xe2\x80\x9csomething on him.\xe2\x80\x9d Also, they \xe2\x80\x9chad their\nkidding clothes on.\xe2\x80\x9d Ordinarily he would have been delighted at the\nhonor implied in being chaffed, but he was suddenly touchy. He grunted,\n\xe2\x80\x9cYuh, sure; maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you guys on as office boys!\xe2\x80\x9d He was\nimpatient as the jest elaborately rolled on to its d\xc3\xa9nouement.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course he may have been meeting a girl,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, and \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I think\nhe was waiting for his old roommate, Sir Jerusalem Doak.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe exploded, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, spring it, spring it, you boneheads! What\xe2\x80\x99s the great\njoke?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurray! George is peeved!\xe2\x80\x9d snickered Sidney Finkelstein, while a grin\nwent round the table. Gunch revealed the shocking truth: He had seen\nBabbitt coming out of a motion-picture theater--at noon!\n\nThey kept it up. With a hundred variations, a hundred guffaws, they\nsaid that he had gone to the movies during business-hours. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t so\nmuch mind Gunch, but he was annoyed by Sidney Finkelstein, that brisk,\nlean, red-headed explainer of jokes. He was bothered, too, by the lump\nof ice in his glass of water. It was too large; it spun round and burned\nhis nose when he tried to drink. He raged that Finkelstein was like that\nlump of ice. But he won through; he kept up his banter till they grew\ntired of the superlative jest and turned to the great problems of the\nday.\n\nHe reflected, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with me to-day? Seems like I\xe2\x80\x99ve got an\nawful grouch. Only they talk so darn much. But I better steer careful\nand keep my mouth shut.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs they lighted their cigars he mumbled, \xe2\x80\x9cGot to get back,\xe2\x80\x9d and on a\nchorus of \xe2\x80\x9cIf you _will_ go spending your mornings with lady ushers at\nthe movies!\xe2\x80\x9d he escaped. He heard them giggling. He was embarrassed.\nWhile he was most bombastically agreeing with the coat-man that the\nweather was warm, he was conscious that he was longing to run childishly\nwith his troubles to the comfort of the fairy child.\n\n\nIII\n\nHe kept Miss McGoun after he had finished dictating. He searched for a\ntopic which would warm her office impersonality into friendliness.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere you going on your vacation?\xe2\x80\x9d he purred.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ll go up-state to a farm do you want me to have the Siddons\nlease copied this afternoon?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no hurry about it.... I suppose you have a great time when you get\naway from us cranks in the office.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe rose and gathered her pencils. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, nobody\xe2\x80\x99s cranky here I think I\ncan get it copied after I do the letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe was gone. Babbitt utterly repudiated the view that he had been\ntrying to discover how approachable was Miss McGoun. \xe2\x80\x9cCourse! knew there\nwas nothing doing!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\nIV\n\nEddie Swanson, the motor-car agent who lived across the street from\nBabbitt, was giving a Sunday supper. His wife Louetta, young Louetta who\nloved jazz in music and in clothes and laughter, was at her wildest. She\ncried, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have a real party!\xe2\x80\x9d as she received the guests. Babbitt\nhad uneasily felt that to many men she might be alluring; now he\nadmitted that to himself she was overwhelmingly alluring. Mrs. Babbitt\nhad never quite approved of Louetta; Babbitt was glad that she was not\nhere this evening.\n\nHe insisted on helping Louetta in the kitchen: taking the chicken\ncroquettes from the warming-oven, the lettuce sandwiches from the\nice-box. He held her hand, once, and she depressingly didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice it.\nShe caroled, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a good little mother\xe2\x80\x99s-helper, Georgie. Now trot in\nwith the tray and leave it on the side-table.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe wished that Eddie Swanson would give them cocktails; that Louetta\nwould have one. He wanted-- Oh, he wanted to be one of these Bohemians\nyou read about. Studio parties. Wild lovely girls who were independent.\nNot necessarily bad. Certainly not! But not tame, like Floral Heights.\nHow he\xe2\x80\x99d ever stood it all these years--\n\nEddie did not give them cocktails. True, they supped with mirth, and\nwith several repetitions by Orville Jones of \xe2\x80\x9cAny time Louetta wants to\ncome sit on my lap I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell this sandwich to beat it!\xe2\x80\x9d but they were\nrespectable, as befitted Sunday evening. Babbitt had discreetly\npre\xc3\xabmpted a place beside Louetta on the piano bench. While he talked\nabout motors, while he listened with a fixed smile to her account of the\nfilm she had seen last Wednesday, while he hoped that she would hurry up\nand finish her description of the plot, the beauty of the leading man,\nand the luxury of the setting, he studied her. Slim waist girdled with\nraw silk, strong brows, ardent eyes, hair parted above a broad\nforehead--she meant youth to him and a charm which saddened. He thought\nof how valiant a companion she would be on a long motor tour, exploring\nmountains, picnicking in a pine grove high above a valley. Her frailness\ntouched him; he was angry at Eddie Swanson for the incessant family\nbickering. All at once he identified Louetta with the fairy girl. He was\nstartled by the conviction that they had always had a romantic\nattraction for each other.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re leading a simply terrible life, now you\xe2\x80\x99re a widower,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet! I\xe2\x80\x99m a bad little fellow and proud of it. Some evening you slip\nEddie some dope in his coffee and sneak across the road and I\xe2\x80\x99ll show\nyou how to mix a cocktail,\xe2\x80\x9d he roared.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, I might do it! You never can tell!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, whenever you\xe2\x80\x99re ready, you just hang a towel out of the attic\nwindow and I\xe2\x80\x99ll jump for the gin!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEvery one giggled at this naughtiness. In a pleased way Eddie Swanson\nstated that he would have a physician analyze his coffee daily. The\nothers were diverted to a discussion of the more agreeable recent\nmurders, but Babbitt drew Louetta back to personal things:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the prettiest dress I ever saw in my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you honestly like it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike it? Why, say, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have Kenneth Escott put a piece in the\npaper saying that the swellest dressed woman in the U. S. is MrS.E.\nLouetta Swanson.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, you stop teasing me!\xe2\x80\x9d But she beamed. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s dance a little.\nGeorge, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to dance with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEven as he protested, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you know what a rotten dancer I am!\xe2\x80\x9d he was\nlumbering to his feet.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you. I can teach anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHer eyes were moist, her voice was jagged with excitement. He was\nconvinced that he had won her. He clasped her, conscious of her smooth\nwarmth, and solemnly he circled in a heavy version of the one-step. He\nbumped into only one or two people. \xe2\x80\x9cGosh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not doing so bad;\nhittin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em up like a regular stage dancer!\xe2\x80\x9d he gloated; and she\nanswered busily, \xe2\x80\x9cYes--yes-- I told you I could teach anybody--_don\xe2\x80\x99t\ntake such long steps_!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFor a moment he was robbed of confidence; with fearful concentration he\nsought to keep time to the music. But he was enveloped again by her\nenchantment. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s got to like me; I\xe2\x80\x99ll make her!\xe2\x80\x9d he vowed. He tried\nto kiss the lock beside her ear. She mechanically moved her head to\navoid it, and mechanically she murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFor a moment he hated her, but after the moment he was as urgent as\never. He danced with Mrs. Orville Jones, but he watched Louetta swooping\ndown the length of the room with her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cCareful! You\xe2\x80\x99re getting\nfoolish!\xe2\x80\x9d he cautioned himself, the while he hopped and bent his solid\nknees in dalliance with Mrs. Jones, and to that worthy lady rumbled,\n\xe2\x80\x9cGee, it\xe2\x80\x99s hot!\xe2\x80\x9d Without reason, he thought of Paul in that shadowy\nplace where men never dance. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m crazy to-night; better go home,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nworried, but he left Mrs. Jones and dashed to Louetta\xe2\x80\x99s lovely side,\ndemanding, \xe2\x80\x9cThe next is mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so hot; I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to dance this one.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d boldly, \xe2\x80\x9ccome out and sit on the porch and get all nice and\ncool.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the tender darkness, with the clamor in the house behind them, he\nresolutely took her hand. She squeezed his once, then relaxed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLouetta! I think you\xe2\x80\x99re the nicest thing I know!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re very nice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you? You got to like me! I\xe2\x80\x99m so lonely!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right when your wife comes home.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m always lonely.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe clasped her hands under her chin, so that he dared not touch her. He\nsighed:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I feel punk and--\xe2\x80\x9d He was about to bring in the tragedy of Paul,\nbut that was too sacred even for the diplomacy of love. \xe2\x80\x9c--when I get\ntired out at the office and everything, I like to look across the street\nand think of you. Do you know I dreamed of you, one time!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it a nice dream?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLovely!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, they say dreams go by opposites! Now I must run in.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe was on her feet.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t go in yet! Please, Louetta!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I must. Have to look out for my guests.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet \xe2\x80\x99em look out for \xe2\x80\x99emselves!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\xe2\x80\x9d She carelessly tapped his shoulder and slipped\naway.\n\nBut after two minutes of shamed and childish longing to sneak home he\nwas snorting, \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t trying to get chummy with her! Knew\nthere was nothing doing, all the time!\xe2\x80\x9d and he ambled in to dance with\nMrs. Orville Jones, and to avoid Louetta, virtuously and conspicuously.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nI\n\nHis visit to Paul was as unreal as his night of fog and questioning.\nUnseeing he went through prison corridors stinking of carbolic acid to a\nroom lined with pale yellow settees pierced in rosettes, like the\nshoe-store benches he had known as a boy. The guard led in Paul. Above\nhis uniform of linty gray, Paul\xe2\x80\x99s face was pale and without expression.\nHe moved timorously in response to the guard\xe2\x80\x99s commands; he meekly\npushed Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s gifts of tobacco and magazines across the table to the\nguard for examination. He had nothing to say but \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting used\nto it\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m working in the tailor shop; the stuff hurts my fingers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt knew that in this place of death Paul was already dead. And as\nhe pondered on the train home something in his own self seemed to have\ndied: a loyal and vigorous faith in the goodness of the world, a fear of\npublic disfavor, a pride in success. He was glad that his wife was away.\nHe admitted it without justifying it. He did not care.\n\n\nII\n\nHer card read \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Daniel Judique.\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt knew of her as the widow of\na wholesale paper-dealer. She must have been forty or forty-two but he\nthought her younger when he saw her in the office, that afternoon. She\nhad come to inquire about renting an apartment, and he took her away\nfrom the unskilled girl accountant. He was nervously attracted by her\nsmartness. She was a slender woman, in a black Swiss frock dotted with\nwhite, a cool-looking graceful frock. A broad black hat shaded her\nface. Her eyes were lustrous, her soft chin of an agreeable plumpness,\nand her cheeks an even rose. Babbitt wondered afterward if she was made\nup, but no man living knew less of such arts.\n\nShe sat revolving her violet parasol. Her voice was appealing without\nbeing coy. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if you can help me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe delighted.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve looked everywhere and-- I want a little flat, just a bedroom, or\nperhaps two, and sitting-room and kitchenette and bath, but I want one\nthat really has some charm to it, not these dingy places or these new\nones with terrible gaudy chandeliers. And I can\xe2\x80\x99t pay so dreadfully\nmuch. My name\xe2\x80\x99s Tanis Judique.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ve got just the thing for you. Would you like to chase\naround and look at it now?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I have a couple of hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the new Cavendish Apartments, Babbitt had a flat which he had been\nholding for Sidney Finkelstein, but at the thought of driving beside\nthis agreeable woman he threw over his friend Finkelstein, and with a\nnote of gallantry he proclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll let you see what I can do!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe dusted the seat of the car for her, and twice he risked death in\nshowing off his driving.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do know how to handle a car!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\nHe liked her voice. There was, he thought, music in it and a hint of\nculture, not a bouncing giggle like Louetta Swanson\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\nHe boasted, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of these fellows that are so scared\nand drive so slow that they get in everybody\xe2\x80\x99s way. The safest driver is\na fellow that knows how to handle his machine and yet isn\xe2\x80\x99t scared to\nspeed up when it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bet you drive like a wiz.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no-- I mean--not really. Of course, we had a car-- I mean, before my\nhusband passed on--and I used to make believe drive it, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nthink any woman ever learns to drive like a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, there\xe2\x80\x99s some mighty good woman drivers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, of course, these women that try to imitate men, and play golf and\neverything, and ruin their complexions and spoil their hands!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so. I never did like these mannish females.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean--of course, I admire them, dreadfully, and I feel so weak and\nuseless beside them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, rats now! I bet you play the piano like a wiz.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no-- I mean--not really.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet you do!\xe2\x80\x9d He glanced at her smooth hands, her diamond and\nruby rings. She caught the glance, snuggled her hands together with a\nkittenish curving of slim white fingers which delighted him, and\nyearned:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do love to play-- I mean-- I like to drum on the piano, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\nhad any real training. Mr. Judique used to say I would\xe2\x80\x99ve been a good\npianist if I\xe2\x80\x99d had any training, but then, I guess he was just\nflattering me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bet he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t! I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet you\xe2\x80\x99ve got temperament.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh-- Do you like music, Mr. Babbitt?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet I do! Only I don\xe2\x80\x99t know \xe2\x80\x99s I care so much for all this\nclassical stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I do! I just love Chopin and all those.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you, honest? Well, of course, I go to lots of these highbrow\nconcerts, but I do like a good jazz orchestra, right up on its toes,\nwith the fellow that plays the bass fiddle spinning it around and\nbeating it up with the bow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know. I do love good dance music. I love to dance, don\xe2\x80\x99t you, Mr.\nBabbitt?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure, you bet. Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m very darn good at it, though.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you are. You ought to let me teach you. I can teach\nanybody to dance.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you give me a lesson some time?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I would.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter be careful, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll be taking you up on that proposition. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\nbe coming up to your flat and making you give me that lesson.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe-es.\xe2\x80\x9d She was not offended, but she was non-committal. He warned\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x9cHave some sense now, you chump! Don\xe2\x80\x99t go making a fool of\nyourself again!\xe2\x80\x9d and with loftiness he discoursed:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could dance like some of these young fellows, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\nyou: I feel it\xe2\x80\x99s a man\xe2\x80\x99s place to take a full, you might say, a creative\nshare in the world\xe2\x80\x99s work and mold conditions and have something to show\nfor his life, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I do!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so I have to sacrifice some of the things I might like to tackle,\nthough I do, by golly, play about as good a game of golf as the next\nfellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you do.... Are you married?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUh--yes.... And, uh, of course official duties-- I\xe2\x80\x99m the vice-president\nof the Boosters\xe2\x80\x99 Club, and I\xe2\x80\x99m running one of the committees of the\nState Association of Real Estate Boards, and that means a lot of work\nand responsibility--and practically no gratitude for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know! Public men never do get proper credit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey looked at each other with a high degree of mutual respect, and at\nthe Cavendish Apartments he helped her out in a courtly manner, waved\nhis hand at the house as though he were presenting it to her, and\nponderously ordered the elevator boy to \xe2\x80\x9chustle and get the keys.\xe2\x80\x9d She\nstood close to him in the elevator, and he was stirred but cautious.\n\nIt was a pretty flat, of white woodwork and soft blue walls. Mrs.\nJudique gushed with pleasure as she agreed to take it, and as they\nwalked down the hall to the elevator she touched his sleeve, caroling,\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad I went to you! It\xe2\x80\x99s such a privilege to meet a man who\nreally Understands. Oh! The flats _some_ people have showed me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe had a sharp instinctive belief that he could put his arm around her,\nbut he rebuked himself and with excessive politeness he saw her to the\ncar, drove her home. All the way back to his office he raged:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlad I had some sense for once.... Curse it, I wish I\xe2\x80\x99d tried. She\xe2\x80\x99s a\ndarling! A corker! A reg\xe2\x80\x99lar charmer! Lovely eyes and darling lips and\nthat trim waist--never get sloppy, like some women.... No, no, no! She\xe2\x80\x99s\na real cultured lady. One of the brightest little women I\xe2\x80\x99ve met these\nmany moons. Understands about Public Topics and-- But, darn it, why\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t I try?... Tanis!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nIII\n\nHe was harassed and puzzled by it, but he found that he was turning\ntoward youth, as youth. The girl who especially disturbed him--though he\nhad never spoken to her--was the last manicure girl on the right in the\nPompeian Barber Shop. She was small, swift, black-haired, smiling. She\nwas nineteen, perhaps, or twenty. She wore thin salmon-colored blouses\nwhich exhibited her shoulders and her black-ribboned camisoles.\n\nHe went to the Pompeian for his fortnightly hair-trim. As always, he\nfelt disloyal at deserting his neighbor, the Reeves Building Barber\nShop. Then, for the first time, he overthrew his sense of guilt.\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoggone it, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go here if I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to! I don\xe2\x80\x99t own the\nReeves Building! These barbers got nothing on me! I\xe2\x80\x99ll doggone well get\nmy hair cut where I doggone well want to! Don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear anything\nmore about it! I\xe2\x80\x99m through standing by people--unless I want to. It\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t get you anywhere. I\xe2\x80\x99m through!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Pompeian Barber Shop was in the basement of the Hotel Thornleigh,\nlargest and most dynamically modern hotel in Zenith. Curving marble\nsteps with a rail of polished brass led from the hotel-lobby down to the\nbarber shop. The interior was of black and white and crimson tiles,\nwith a sensational ceiling of burnished gold, and a fountain in which a\nmassive nymph forever emptied a scarlet cornucopia. Forty barbers and\nnine manicure girls worked desperately, and at the door six colored\nporters lurked to greet the customers, to care reverently for their hats\nand collars, to lead them to a place of waiting where, on a carpet like\na tropic isle in the stretch of white stone floor, were a dozen leather\nchairs and a table heaped with magazines.\n\nBabbitt\xe2\x80\x99s porter was an obsequious gray-haired negro who did him an\nhonor highly esteemed in the land of Zenith--greeted him by name. Yet\nBabbitt was unhappy. His bright particular manicure girl was engaged.\nShe was doing the nails of an overdressed man and giggling with him.\nBabbitt hated him. He thought of waiting, but to stop the powerful\nsystem of the Pompeian was inconceivable, and he was instantly wafted\ninto a chair.\n\nAbout him was luxury, rich and delicate. One votary was having a\nviolet-ray facial treatment, the next an oil shampoo. Boys wheeled about\nmiraculous electrical massage-machines. The barbers snatched steaming\ntowels from a machine like a howitzer of polished nickel and\ndisdainfully flung them away after a second\xe2\x80\x99s use. On the vast marble\nshelf facing the chairs were hundreds of tonics, amber and ruby and\nemerald. It was flattering to Babbitt to have two personal slaves at\nonce--the barber and the bootblack. He would have been completely happy\nif he could also have had the manicure girl. The barber snipped at his\nhair and asked his opinion of the Havre de Grace races, the baseball\nseason, and Mayor Prout. The young negro bootblack hummed \xe2\x80\x9cThe Camp\nMeeting Blues\xe2\x80\x9d and polished in rhythm to his tune, drawing the shiny\nshoe-rag so taut at each stroke that it snapped like a banjo string. The\nbarber was an excellent salesman. He made Babbitt feel rich and\nimportant by his manner of inquiring, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your favorite tonic, sir?\nHave you time to-day, sir, for a facial massage? Your scalp is a little\ntight; shall I give you a scalp massage?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt\xe2\x80\x99s best thrill was in the shampoo. The barber made his hair\ncreamy with thick soap, then (as Babbitt bent over the bowl, muffled in\ntowels) drenched it with hot water which prickled along his scalp, and\nat last ran the water ice-cold. At the shock, the sudden burning cold on\nhis skull, Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s heart thumped, his chest heaved, and his spine was\nan electric wire. It was a sensation which broke the monotony of life.\nHe looked grandly about the shop as he sat up. The barber obsequiously\nrubbed his wet hair and bound it in a towel as in a turban, so that\nBabbitt resembled a plump pink calif on an ingenious and adjustable\nthrone. The barber begged (in the manner of one who was a good fellow\nyet was overwhelmed by the splendors of the calif), \xe2\x80\x9cHow about a little\nEldorado Oil Rub, sir? Very beneficial to the scalp, sir. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I give\nyou one the last time?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t, but Babbitt agreed, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith quaking eagerness he saw that his manicure girl was free.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a manicure after all,\xe2\x80\x9d he droned, and\nexcitedly watched her coming, dark-haired, smiling, tender, little. The\nmanicuring would have to be finished at her table, and he would be able\nto talk to her without the barber listening. He waited contentedly, not\ntrying to peep at her, while she filed his nails and the barber shaved\nhim and smeared on his burning cheeks all the interesting mixtures which\nthe pleasant minds of barbers have devised through the revolving ages.\nWhen the barber was done and he sat opposite the girl at her table, he\nadmired the marble slab of it, admired the sunken set bowl with its tiny\nsilver taps, and admired himself for being able to frequent so costly a\nplace. When she withdrew his wet hand from the bowl, it was so sensitive\nfrom the warm soapy water that he was abnormally aware of the clasp of\nher firm little paw. He delighted in the pinkness and glossiness of her\nnails. Her hands seemed to him more adorable than Mrs. Judique\xe2\x80\x99s thin\nfingers, and more elegant. He had a certain ecstasy in the pain when she\ngnawed at the cuticle of his nails with a sharp knife. He struggled not\nto look at the outline of her young bosom and her shoulders, the more\napparent under a film of pink chiffon. He was conscious of her as an\nexquisite thing, and when he tried to impress his personality on her he\nspoke as awkwardly as a country boy at his first party:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, kinda hot to be working to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, it is hot. You cut your own nails, last time, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe-es, guess I must\xe2\x80\x99ve.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou always ought to go to a manicure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s so. I--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing looks so nice as nails that are looked after good. I\nalways think that\xe2\x80\x99s the best way to spot a real gent. There was an auto\nsalesman in here yesterday that claimed you could always tell a fellow\xe2\x80\x99s\nclass by the car he drove, but I says to him, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be silly,\xe2\x80\x99 I says;\n\xe2\x80\x98the wisenheimers grab a look at a fellow\xe2\x80\x99s nails when they want to tell\nif he\xe2\x80\x99s a tinhorn or a real gent!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s something to that. Course, that is--with a pretty\nkiddy like you, a man can\xe2\x80\x99t help coming to get his mitts done.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeh, I may be a kid, but I\xe2\x80\x99m a wise bird, and I know nice folks when I\nsee um-- I can read character at a glance--and I\xe2\x80\x99d never talk so frank\nwith a fellow if I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see he was a nice fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe smiled. Her eyes seemed to him as gentle as April pools. With great\nseriousness he informed himself that \xe2\x80\x9cthere were some roughnecks who\nwould think that just because a girl was a manicure girl and maybe not\nawful well educated, she was no good, but as for him, he was a democrat,\nand understood people,\xe2\x80\x9d and he stood by the assertion that this was a\nfine girl, a good girl--but not too uncomfortably good. He inquired in a\nvoice quick with sympathy:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you have a lot of fellows who try to get fresh with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, gee, do I! Say, listen, there\xe2\x80\x99s some of these cigar-store sports\nthat think because a girl\xe2\x80\x99s working in a barber shop, they can get away\nwith anything. The things they saaaaaay! But, believe me, I know how to\nhop those birds! I just give um the north and south and ask um, \xe2\x80\x98Say,\nwho do you think you\xe2\x80\x99re talking to?\xe2\x80\x99 and they fade away like love\xe2\x80\x99s\nyoung nightmare and oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t you want a box of nail-paste? It will keep\nthe nails as shiny as when first manicured, harmless to apply and lasts\nfor days.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try some. Say-- Say, it\xe2\x80\x99s funny; I\xe2\x80\x99ve been coming here ever\nsince the shop opened and--\xe2\x80\x9d With arch surprise. \xe2\x80\x9c-- I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\nknow your name!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you? My, that\xe2\x80\x99s funny! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know yours!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you quit kidding me! What\xe2\x80\x99s the nice little name?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t so darn nice. I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of kike. But my folks\nain\xe2\x80\x99t kikes. My papa\xe2\x80\x99s papa was a nobleman in Poland, and there was a\ngentleman in here one day, he was kind of a count or something--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKind of a no-account, I guess you mean!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s telling this, smarty? And he said he knew my papa\xe2\x80\x99s papa\xe2\x80\x99s folks\nin Poland and they had a dandy big house. Right on a lake!\xe2\x80\x9d Doubtfully,\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure. No. Really. Sure I do. Why not? Don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m kidding you,\nhoney, but every time I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed you I\xe2\x80\x99ve said to myself, \xe2\x80\x98That kid\nhas Blue Blood in her veins!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you, honest?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonest I did. Well, well, come on--now we\xe2\x80\x99re friends--what\xe2\x80\x99s the\ndarling little name?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIda Putiak. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t so much-a-much of a name. I always say to Ma, I\nsay, \xe2\x80\x98Ma, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you name me Dolores, or something with some class\nto it?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a scrumptious name. Ida!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bet I know _your_ name!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, not necessarily. Of course-- Oh, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t so specially well\nknown.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you Mr. Sondheim that travels for the Krackajack Kitchen Kutlery\nKo.?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not! I\xe2\x80\x99m Mr. Babbitt, the real-estate broker!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, excuse me! Oh, of course. You mean here in Zenith.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYep.\xe2\x80\x9d With the briskness of one whose feelings have been hurt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sure. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read your ads. They\xe2\x80\x99re swell.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUm, well-- You might have read about my speeches.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourse I have! I don\xe2\x80\x99t get much time to read but-- I guess you think I\xe2\x80\x99m\nan awfully silly little nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99re a little darling!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell-- There\xe2\x80\x99s one nice thing about this job. It gives a girl a chance\nto meet some awfully nice gentlemen and improve her mind with\nconversation, and you get so you can read a guy\xe2\x80\x99s character at the first\nglance.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Ida; please don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m getting fresh--\xe2\x80\x9d He was hotly\nreflecting that it would be humiliating to be rejected by this child,\nand dangerous to be accepted. If he took her to dinner, if he were seen\nby censorious friends-- But he went on ardently: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m getting\nfresh if I suggest it would be nice for us to go out and have a little\ndinner together some evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know as I ought to but-- My gentleman-friend\xe2\x80\x99s always wanting to\ntake me out. But maybe I could to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nIV\n\nThere was no reason, he assured himself, why he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a quiet\ndinner with a poor girl who would benefit by association with an\neducated and mature person like himself. But, lest some one see them\nand not understand, he would take her to Biddlemeier\xe2\x80\x99s Inn, on the\noutskirts of the city. They would have a pleasant drive, this hot lonely\nevening, and he might hold her hand--no, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even do that. Ida\nwas complaisant; her bare shoulders showed it only too clearly; but he\xe2\x80\x99d\nbe hanged if he\xe2\x80\x99d make love to her merely because she expected it.\n\nThen his car broke down; something had happened to the ignition. And he\n_had_ to have the car this evening! Furiously he tested the spark-plugs,\nstared at the commutator. His angriest glower did not seem to stir the\nsulky car, and in disgrace it was hauled off to a garage. With a renewed\nthrill he thought of a taxicab. There was something at once wealthy and\ninterestingly wicked about a taxicab.\n\nBut when he met her, on a corner two blocks from the Hotel Thornleigh,\nshe said, \xe2\x80\x9cA taxi? Why, I thought you owned a car!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do. Of course I do! But it\xe2\x80\x99s out of commission to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked, as one who had heard that tale before.\n\nAll the way out to Biddlemeier\xe2\x80\x99s Inn he tried to talk as an old friend,\nbut he could not pierce the wall of her words. With interminable\nindignation she narrated her retorts to \xe2\x80\x9cthat fresh head-barber\xe2\x80\x9d and the\ndrastic things she would do to him if he persisted in saying that she\nwas \xe2\x80\x9cbetter at gassing than at hoof-paring.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt Biddlemeier\xe2\x80\x99s Inn they were unable to get anything to drink. The\nhead-waiter refused to understand who George F. Babbitt was. They sat\nsteaming before a vast mixed grill, and made conversation about\nbaseball. When he tried to hold Ida\xe2\x80\x99s hand she said with bright\nfriendliness, \xe2\x80\x9cCareful! That fresh waiter is rubbering.\xe2\x80\x9d But they came\nout into a treacherous summer night, the air lazy and a little moon\nabove transfigured maples.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s drive some other place, where we can get a drink and dance!\xe2\x80\x9d he\ndemanded.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure, some other night. But I promised Ma I\xe2\x80\x99d be home early to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRats! It\xe2\x80\x99s too nice to go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d just love to, but Ma would give me fits.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe was trembling. She was everything that was young and exquisite. He\nput his arm about her. She snuggled against his shoulder, unafraid, and\nhe was triumphant. Then she ran down the steps of the Inn, singing,\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Georgie, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a nice drive and get cool.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was a night of lovers. All along the highway into Zenith, under the\nlow and gentle moon, motors were parked and dim figures were clasped in\nrevery. He held out hungry hands to Ida, and when she patted them he was\ngrateful. There was no sense of struggle and transition; he kissed her\nand simply she responded to his kiss, they two behind the stolid back of\nthe chauffeur.\n\nHer hat fell off, and she broke from his embrace to reach for it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, let it be!\xe2\x80\x9d he implored.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh? My hat? Not a chance!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe waited till she had pinned it on, then his arm sank about her. She\ndrew away from it, and said with maternal soothing, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t be a\nsilly boy! Mustn\xe2\x80\x99t make Ittle Mama scold! Just sit back, dearie, and see\nwhat a swell night it is. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a good boy, maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll kiss you when\nwe say nighty-night. Now give me a cigarette.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe was solicitous about lighting her cigarette and inquiring as to her\ncomfort. Then he sat as far from her as possible. He was cold with\nfailure. No one could have told Babbitt that he was a fool with more\nvigor, precision, and intelligence than he himself displayed. He\nreflected that from the standpoint of the Rev. Dr. John Jennison Drew he\nwas a wicked man, and from the standpoint of Miss Ida Putiak, an old\nbore who had to be endured as the penalty attached to eating a large\ndinner.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearie, you aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to go and get peevish, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe spoke pertly. He wanted to spank her. He brooded, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have to\ntake anything off this gutter-pup! Darn immigrant! Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s get it\nover as quick as we can, and sneak home and kick ourselves for the rest\nof the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe snorted, \xe2\x80\x9cHuh? Me peevish? Why, you baby, why should I be peevish?\nNow, listen, Ida; listen to Uncle George. I want to put you wise about\nthis scrapping with your head-barber all the time. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of\nexperience with employees, and let me tell you it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pay to\nantagonize--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt the drab wooden house in which she lived he said good-night briefly\nand amiably, but as the taxicab drove off he was praying \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\nI\n\nHe awoke to stretch cheerfully as he listened to the sparrows, then to\nremember that everything was wrong; that he was determined to go astray,\nand not in the least enjoying the process. Why, he wondered, should he\nbe in rebellion? What was it all about? \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not be sensible; stop all\nthis idiotic running around, and enjoy himself with his family, his\nbusiness, the fellows at the club?\xe2\x80\x9d What was he getting out of\nrebellion? Misery and shame--the shame of being treated as an offensive\nsmall boy by a ragamuffin like Ida Putiak! And yet-- Always he came back\nto \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet.\xe2\x80\x9d Whatever the misery, he could not regain contentment with\na world which, once doubted, became absurd.\n\nOnly, he assured himself, he was \xe2\x80\x9cthrough with this chasing after\ngirls.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBy noontime he was not so sure even of that. If in Miss McGoun, Louetta\nSwanson, and Ida he had failed to find the lady kind and lovely, it did\nnot prove that she did not exist. He was hunted by the ancient thought\nthat somewhere must exist the not impossible she who would understand\nhim, value him, and make him happy.\n\n\nII\n\nMrs. Babbitt returned in August.\n\nOn her previous absences he had missed her reassuring buzz and of her\narrival he had made a f\xc3\xaate. Now, though he dared not hurt her by letting\na hint of it appear in his letters, he was sorry that she was coming\nbefore he had found himself, and he was embarrassed by the need of\nmeeting her and looking joyful.\n\nHe loitered down to the station; he studied the summer-resort posters,\nlest he have to speak to acquaintances and expose his uneasiness. But he\nwas well trained. When the train clanked in he was out on the cement\nplatform, peering into the chair-cars, and as he saw her in the line of\npassengers moving toward the vestibule he waved his hat. At the door he\nembraced her, and announced, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, well, well, by golly, you look\nfine, you look fine.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he was aware of Tinka. Here was something,\nthis child with her absurd little nose and lively eyes, that loved him,\nbelieved him great, and as he clasped her, lifted and held her till she\nsquealed, he was for the moment come back to his old steady self.\n\nTinka sat beside him in the car, with one hand on the steering-wheel,\npretending to help him drive, and he shouted back to his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bet\nthe kid will be the best chuffer in the family! She holds the wheel like\nan old professional!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAll the while he was dreading the moment when he would be alone with his\nwife and she would patiently expect him to be ardent.\n\n\nIII\n\nThere was about the house an unofficial theory that he was to take his\nvacation alone, to spend a week or ten days in Catawba, but he was\nnagged by the memory that a year ago he had been with Paul in Maine. He\nsaw himself returning; finding peace there, and the presence of Paul, in\na life primitive and heroic. Like a shock came the thought that he\nactually could go. Only, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, really; he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave his\nbusiness, and \xe2\x80\x9cMyra would think it sort of funny, his going way off\nthere alone. Course he\xe2\x80\x99d decided to do whatever he darned pleased, from\nnow on, but still--to go way off to Maine!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe went, after lengthy meditations.\n\nWith his wife, since it was inconceivable to explain that he was going\nto seek Paul\xe2\x80\x99s spirit in the wilderness, he frugally employed the lie\nprepared over a year ago and scarcely used at all. He said that he had\nto see a man in New York on business. He could not have explained even\nto himself why he drew from the bank several hundred dollars more than\nhe needed, nor why he kissed Tinka so tenderly, and cried, \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless\nyou, baby!\xe2\x80\x9d From the train he waved to her till she was but a scarlet\nspot beside the brown bulkier presence of Mrs. Babbitt, at the end of a\nsteel and cement aisle ending in vast barred gates. With melancholy he\nlooked back at the last suburb of Zenith.\n\nAll the way north he pictured the Maine guides: simple and strong and\ndaring, jolly as they played stud-poker in their unceiled shack, wise in\nwoodcraft as they tramped the forest and shot the rapids. He\nparticularly remembered Joe Paradise, half Yankee, half Indian. If he\ncould but take up a backwoods claim with a man like Joe, work hard with\nhis hands, be free and noisy in a flannel shirt, and never come back to\nthis dull decency!\n\nOr, like a trapper in a Northern Canada movie, plunge through the\nforest, make camp in the Rockies, a grim and wordless caveman! Why not?\nHe _could_ do it! There\xe2\x80\x99d be enough money at home for the family to live\non till Verona was married and Ted self-supporting. Old Henry T. would\nlook out for them. Honestly! Why _not_? Really _live_--\n\nHe longed for it, admitted that he longed for it, then almost believed\nthat he was going to do it. Whenever common sense snorted, \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\nFolks don\xe2\x80\x99t run away from decent families and partners; just simply\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t do it, that\xe2\x80\x99s all!\xe2\x80\x9d then Babbitt answered pleadingly, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take any more nerve than for Paul to go to jail and-- Lord, how\nI\xe2\x80\x99d like to do it! Moccasins--six-gun--frontier town--gamblers--sleep\nunder the stars--be a regular man, with he-men like Joe\nParadise--gosh!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo he came to Maine, again stood on the wharf before the camp-hotel,\nagain spat heroically into the delicate and shivering water, while the\npines rustled, the mountains glowed, and a trout leaped and fell in a\nsliding circle. He hurried to the guides\xe2\x80\x99 shack as to his real home, his\nreal friends, long missed. They would be glad to see him. They would\nstand up and shout, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, here\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Babbitt! He ain\xe2\x80\x99t one of these\nordinary sports! He\xe2\x80\x99s a real guy!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn their boarded and rather littered cabin the guides sat about the\ngreasy table playing stud-poker with greasy cards: half a dozen wrinkled\nmen in old trousers and easy old felt hats. They glanced up and nodded.\nJoe Paradise, the swart aging man with the big mustache, grunted, \xe2\x80\x9cHow\ndo. Back again?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSilence, except for the clatter of chips.\n\nBabbitt stood beside them, very lonely. He hinted, after a period of\nhighly concentrated playing, \xe2\x80\x9cGuess I might take a hand, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure. Sit in. How many chips you want? Let\xe2\x80\x99s see; you were here with\nyour wife, last year, wa\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe Paradise.\n\nThat was all of Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s welcome to the old home.\n\nHe played for half an hour before he spoke again. His head was reeking\nwith the smoke of pipes and cheap cigars, and he was weary of pairs and\nfour-flushes, resentful of the way in which they ignored him. He flung\nat Joe:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorking now?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNope.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike to guide me for a few days?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, jus\xe2\x80\x99 soon. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t engaged till next week.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOnly thus did Joe recognize the friendship Babbitt was offering him.\nBabbitt paid up his losses and left the shack rather childishly. Joe\nraised his head from the coils of smoke like a seal rising from surf,\ngrunted, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come \xe2\x80\x99round t\xe2\x80\x99morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d and dived down to his three aces.\n\nNeither in his voiceless cabin, fragrant with planks of new-cut pine,\nnor along the lake, nor in the sunset clouds which presently eddied\nbehind the lavender-misted mountains, could Babbitt find the spirit of\nPaul as a reassuring presence. He was so lonely that after supper he\nstopped to talk with an ancient old lady, a gasping and steadily\ndiscoursing old lady, by the stove in the hotel-office. He told her of\nTed\xe2\x80\x99s presumable future triumphs in the State University and of Tinka\xe2\x80\x99s\nremarkable vocabulary till he was homesick for the home he had left\nforever.\n\nThrough the darkness, through that Northern pine-walled silence, he\nblundered down to the lake-front and found a canoe. There were no\npaddles in it but with a board, sitting awkwardly amidships and poking\nat the water rather than paddling, he made his way far out on the lake.\nThe lights of the hotel and the cottages became yellow dots, a cluster\nof glow-worms at the base of Sachem Mountain. Larger and ever more\nimperturbable was the mountain in the star-filtered darkness, and the\nlake a limitless pavement of black marble. He was dwarfed and dumb and a\nlittle awed, but that insignificance freed him from the pomposities of\nbeing Mr. George F. Babbitt of Zenith; saddened and freed his heart. Now\nhe was conscious of the presence of Paul, fancied him (rescued from\nprison, from Zilla and the brisk exactitudes of the tar-roofing\nbusiness) playing his violin at the end of the canoe. He vowed, \xe2\x80\x9cI will\ngo on! I\xe2\x80\x99ll never go back! Now that Paul\xe2\x80\x99s out of it, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\nsee any of those damn people again! I was a fool to get sore because Joe\nParadise didn\xe2\x80\x99t jump up and hug me. He\xe2\x80\x99s one of these woodsmen; too wise\nto go yelping and talking your arm off like a cityman. But get him back\nin the mountains, out on the trail--! That\xe2\x80\x99s real living!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nIV\n\nJoe reported at Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s cabin at nine the next morning. Babbitt\ngreeted him as a fellow caveman:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Joe, how d\xe2\x80\x99you feel about hitting the trail, and getting away\nfrom these darn soft summerites and these women and all?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Mr. Babbitt.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say we go over to Box Car Pond--they tell me the shack\nthere isn\xe2\x80\x99t being used--and camp out?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, all right, Mr. Babbitt, but it\xe2\x80\x99s nearer to Skowtuit Pond, and you\ncan get just about as good fishing there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I want to get into the real wilds.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll put the old packs on our backs and get into the woods and really\nhike.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think maybe it would be easier to go by water, through Lake Chogue.\nWe can go all the way by motor boat--flat-bottom boat with an Evinrude.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir! Bust up the quiet with a chugging motor? Not on your life! You\njust throw a pair of socks in the old pack, and tell \xe2\x80\x99em what you want\nfor eats. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be ready soon\xe2\x80\x99s you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost of the sports go by boat, Mr. Babbitt. It\xe2\x80\x99s a long walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Joe: are you objecting to walking?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, I guess I can do it. But I haven\xe2\x80\x99t tramped that far for sixteen\nyears. Most of the sports go by boat. But I can do it if you say so-- I\nguess.\xe2\x80\x9d Joe walked away in sadness.\n\nBabbitt had recovered from his touchy wrath before Joe returned. He\npictured him as warming up and telling the most entertaining stories.\nBut Joe had not yet warmed up when they took the trail. He persistently\nkept behind Babbitt, and however much his shoulders ached from the\npack, however sorely he panted, Babbitt could hear his guide panting\nequally. But the trail was satisfying: a path brown with pine-needles\nand rough with roots, among the balsams, the ferns, the sudden groves of\nwhite birch. He became credulous again, and rejoiced in sweating. When\nhe stopped to rest he chuckled, \xe2\x80\x9cGuess we\xe2\x80\x99re hitting it up pretty good\nfor a couple o\xe2\x80\x99 old birds, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUh-huh,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Joe.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a mighty pretty place. Look, you can see the lake down through\nthe trees. I tell you, Joe, you don\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate how lucky you are to\nlive in woods like this, instead of a city with trolleys grinding and\ntypewriters clacking and people bothering the life out of you all the\ntime! I wish I knew the woods like you do. Say, what\xe2\x80\x99s the name of that\nlittle red flower?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRubbing his back, Joe regarded the flower resentfully. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, some folks\ncall it one thing and some calls it another I always just call it Pink\nFlower.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt blessedly ceased thinking as tramping turned into blind\nplodding. He was submerged in weariness. His plump legs seemed to go on\nby themselves, without guidance, and he mechanically wiped away the\nsweat which stung his eyes. He was too tired to be consciously glad as,\nafter a sun-scourged mile of corduroy tote-road through a swamp where\nflies hovered over a hot waste of brush, they reached the cool shore of\nBox Car Pond. When he lifted the pack from his back he staggered from\nthe change in balance, and for a moment could not stand erect. He lay\nbeneath an ample-bosomed maple tree near the guest-shack, and joyously\nfelt sleep running through his veins.\n\nHe awoke toward dusk, to find Joe efficiently cooking bacon and eggs and\nflapjacks for supper, and his admiration of the woodsman returned. He\nsat on a stump and felt virile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoe, what would you do if you had a lot of money? Would you stick to\nguiding, or would you take a claim \xe2\x80\x99way back in the woods and be\nindependent of people?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFor the first time Joe brightened. He chewed his cud a second, and\nbubbled, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve often thought of that! If I had the money, I\xe2\x80\x99d go down to\nTinker\xe2\x80\x99s Falls and open a swell shoe store.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter supper Joe proposed a game of stud-poker but Babbitt refused with\nbrevity, and Joe contentedly went to bed at eight. Babbitt sat on the\nstump, facing the dark pond, slapping mosquitos. Save the snoring guide,\nthere was no other human being within ten miles. He was lonelier than he\nhad ever been in his life. Then he was in Zenith.\n\nHe was worrying as to whether Miss McGoun wasn\xe2\x80\x99t paying too much for\ncarbon paper. He was at once resenting and missing the persistent\nteasing at the Roughnecks\xe2\x80\x99 Table. He was wondering what Zilla Riesling\nwas doing now. He was wondering whether, after the summer\xe2\x80\x99s maturity of\nbeing a garageman, Ted would \xe2\x80\x9cget busy\xe2\x80\x9d in the university. He was\nthinking of his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she would only--if she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so darn\nsatisfied with just settling down-- No! I won\xe2\x80\x99t! I won\xe2\x80\x99t go back! I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\nfifty in three years. Sixty in thirteen years. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have some\nfun before it\xe2\x80\x99s too late. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care! I will!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe thought of Ida Putiak, of Louetta Swanson, of that nice widow--what\nwas her name?--Tanis Judique?--the one for whom he\xe2\x80\x99d found the flat. He\nwas enmeshed in imaginary conversations. Then:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGee, I can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to get away from thinking about folks!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThus it came to him merely to run away was folly, because he could never\nrun away from himself.\n\nThat moment he started for Zenith. In his journey there was no\nappearance of flight, but he was fleeing, and four days afterward he was\non the Zenith train. He knew that he was slinking back not because it\nwas what he longed to do but because it was all he could do. He scanned\nagain his discovery that he could never run away from Zenith and family\nand office, because in his own brain he bore the office and the family\nand every street and disquiet and illusion of Zenith.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m going to--oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to start something!\xe2\x80\x9d he vowed, and he\ntried to make it valiant.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\nI\n\nAs he walked through the train, looking for familiar faces, he saw only\none person whom he knew, and that was Seneca Doane, the lawyer who,\nafter the blessings of being in Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s own class at college and of\nbecoming a corporation-counsel, had turned crank, had headed\nfarmer-labor tickets and fraternized with admitted socialists. Though he\nwas in rebellion, naturally Babbitt did not care to be seen talking with\nsuch a fanatic, but in all the Pullmans he could find no other\nacquaintance, and reluctantly he halted. Seneca Doane was a slight,\nthin-haired man, rather like Chum Frink except that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t Frink\xe2\x80\x99s\ngrin. He was reading a book called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Way of All Flesh.\xe2\x80\x9d It looked\nreligious to Babbitt, and he wondered if Doane could possibly have been\nconverted and turned decent and patriotic.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, hello, Doane,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nDoane looked up. His voice was curiously kind. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! How do, Babbitt.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeen away, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in Washington.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWashington, eh? How\xe2\x80\x99s the old Government making out?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s-- Won\xe2\x80\x99t you sit down?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks. Don\xe2\x80\x99t care if I do. Well, well! Been quite a while since I\xe2\x80\x99ve\nhad a good chance to talk to you, Doane. I was, uh-- Sorry you didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nturn up at the last class-dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh--thanks.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s the unions coming? Going to run for mayor again?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDoane seemed restless. He was fingering the pages of his book. He said\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might\xe2\x80\x9d as though it didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything in particular, and he\nsmiled.\n\nBabbitt liked that smile, and hunted for conversation: \xe2\x80\x9cSaw a bang-up\ncabaret in New York: the \xe2\x80\x98Good-Morning Cutie\xe2\x80\x99 bunch at the Hotel\nMinton.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they\xe2\x80\x99re pretty girls. I danced there one evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh. Like dancing?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaturally. I like dancing and pretty women and good food better than\nanything else in the world. Most men do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut gosh, Doane, I thought you fellows wanted to take all the good eats\nand everything away from us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Not at all. What I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see is the meetings of the Garment\nWorkers held at the Ritz, with a dance afterward. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that\nreasonable?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYuh, might be good idea, all right. Well-- Shame I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen more of\nyou, recent years. Oh, say, hope you haven\xe2\x80\x99t held it against me, my\nbucking you as mayor, going on the stump for Prout. You see, I\xe2\x80\x99m an\norganization Republican, and I kind of felt--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t fight me. I have no doubt you\xe2\x80\x99re\ngood for the Organization. I remember--in college you were an unusually\nliberal, sensitive chap. I can still recall your saying to me that you\nwere going to be a lawyer, and take the cases of the poor for nothing,\nand fight the rich. And I remember I said I was going to be one of the\nrich myself, and buy paintings and live at Newport. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\ninspired us all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell.... Well.... I\xe2\x80\x99ve always aimed to be liberal.\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt was\nenormously shy and proud and self-conscious; he tried to look like the\nboy he had been a quarter-century ago, and he shone upon his old friend\nSeneca Doane as he rumbled, \xe2\x80\x9cTrouble with a lot of these fellows, even\nthe live wires and some of \xe2\x80\x99em that think they\xe2\x80\x99re forward-looking, is\nthey aren\xe2\x80\x99t broad-minded and liberal. Now, I always believe in giving\nthe other fellow a chance, and listening to his ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell you how I figure it: A little opposition is good for all of us, so\na fellow, especially if he\xe2\x80\x99s a business man and engaged in doing the\nwork of the world, ought to be liberal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always say a fellow ought to have Vision and Ideals. I guess some of\nthe fellows in my business think I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty visionary, but I just let\n\xe2\x80\x99em think what they want to and go right on--same as you do.... By\ngolly, this is nice to have a chance to sit and visit and kind of, you\nmight say, brush up on our ideals.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut of course we visionaries do rather get beaten. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it bother\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit! Nobody can dictate to me what I think!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re the man I want to help me. I want you to talk to some of the\nbusiness men and try to make them a little more liberal in their\nattitude toward poor Beecher Ingram.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIngram? But, why, he\xe2\x80\x99s this nut preacher that got kicked out of the\nCongregationalist Church, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he, and preaches free love and\nsedition?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis, Doane explained, was indeed the general conception of Beecher\nIngram, but he himself saw Beecher Ingram as a priest of the brotherhood\nof man, of which Babbitt was notoriously an upholder. So would Babbitt\nkeep his acquaintances from hounding Ingram and his forlorn little\nchurch?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet! I\xe2\x80\x99ll call down any of the boys I hear getting funny about\nIngram,\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt said affectionately to his dear friend Doane.\n\nDoane warmed up and became reminiscent. He spoke of student days in\nGermany, of lobbying for single tax in Washington, of international\nlabor conferences. He mentioned his friends, Lord Wycombe, Colonel\nWedgwood, Professor Piccoli. Babbitt had always supposed that Doane\nassociated only with the I. W. W., but now he nodded gravely, as one who\nknew Lord Wycombes by the score, and he got in two references to Sir\nGerald Doak. He felt daring and idealistic and cosmopolitan.\n\nSuddenly, in his new spiritual grandeur, he was sorry for Zilla\nRiesling, and understood her as these ordinary fellows at the Boosters\xe2\x80\x99\nClub never could.\n\n\nII\n\nFive hours after he had arrived in Zenith and told his wife how hot it\nwas in New York, he went to call on Zilla. He was buzzing with ideas and\nforgiveness. He\xe2\x80\x99d get Paul released; he\xe2\x80\x99d do things, vague but highly\nbenevolent things, for Zilla; he\xe2\x80\x99d be as generous as his friend Seneca\nDoane.\n\nHe had not seen Zilla since Paul had shot her, and he still pictured her\nas buxom, high-colored, lively, and a little blowsy. As he drove up to\nher boarding-house, in a depressing back street below the wholesale\ndistrict, he stopped in discomfort. At an upper window, leaning on her\nelbow, was a woman with the features of Zilla, but she was bloodless and\naged, like a yellowed wad of old paper crumpled into wrinkles. Where\nZilla had bounced and jiggled, this woman was dreadfully still.\n\nHe waited half an hour before she came into the boarding-house parlor.\nFifty times he opened the book of photographs of the Chicago World\xe2\x80\x99s\nFair of 1893, fifty times he looked at the picture of the Court of\nHonor.\n\nHe was startled to find Zilla in the room. She wore a black streaky gown\nwhich she had tried to brighten with a girdle of crimson ribbon. The\nribbon had been torn and patiently mended. He noted this carefully,\nbecause he did not wish to look at her shoulders. One shoulder was lower\nthan the other; one arm she carried in contorted fashion, as though it\nwere paralyzed; and behind a high collar of cheap lace there was a gouge\nin the anemic neck which had once been shining and softly plump.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, old Zilla! By golly, it\xe2\x80\x99s good to see you again!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can send his messages through a lawyer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, rats, Zilla, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t come just because of him. Came as an old\nfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou waited long enough!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know how it is. Figured you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see a friend of\nhis for quite some time and-- Sit down, honey! Let\xe2\x80\x99s be sensible. We\xe2\x80\x99ve\nall of us done a bunch of things that we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t ought to, but maybe we\ncan sort of start over again. Honest, Zilla, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to do something to\nmake you both happy. Know what I thought to-day? Mind you, Paul doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\nknow a thing about this--doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know I was going to come see you. I got\nto thinking: Zilla\xe2\x80\x99s a fine, big-hearted woman, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll understand\nthat, uh, Paul\xe2\x80\x99s had his lesson now. Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be a fine idea if\nyou asked the governor to pardon him? Believe he would, if it came from\nyou. No! Wait! Just think how good you\xe2\x80\x99d feel if you were generous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I wish to be generous.\xe2\x80\x9d She was sitting primly, speaking icily.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor that reason I wish to keep him in prison, as an example to\nevil-doers. I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten religion, George, since the terrible thing that\nman did to me. Sometimes I used to be unkind, and I wished for worldly\npleasures, for dancing and the theater. But when I was in the hospital\nthe pastor of the Pentecostal Communion Faith used to come to see me,\nand he showed me, right from the prophecies written in the Word of God,\nthat the Day of Judgment is coming and all the members of the older\nchurches are going straight to eternal damnation, because they only do\nlip-service and swallow the world, the flesh, and the devil--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFor fifteen wild minutes she talked, pouring out admonitions to flee the\nwrath to come, and her face flushed, her dead voice recaptured something\nof the shrill energy of the old Zilla. She wound up with a furious:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the blessing of God himself that Paul should be in prison now, and\ntorn and humbled by punishment, so that he may yet save his soul, and so\nother wicked men, these horrible chasers after women and lust, may have\nan example.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt had itched and twisted. As in church he dared not move during\nthe sermon so now he felt that he must seem attentive, though her\nscreeching denunciations flew past him like carrion birds.\n\nHe sought to be calm and brotherly:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know, Zilla. But gosh, it certainly is the essence of religion\nto be charitable, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Let me tell you how I figure it: What we\nneed in the world is liberalism, liberality, if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get\nanywhere. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always believed in being broad-minded and liberal--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou? Liberal?\xe2\x80\x9d It was very much the old Zilla. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, George Babbitt,\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re about as broad-minded and liberal as a razor-blade!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am, am I! Well, just let me tell you, just--let--me--tell--you,\nI\xe2\x80\x99m as by golly liberal as you are religious, anyway! _You religious!_\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so! Our pastor says I sustain him in the faith!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bet you do! With Paul\xe2\x80\x99s money! But just to show you how liberal I\nam, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to send a check for ten bucks to this Beecher Ingram,\nbecause a lot of fellows are saying the poor cuss preaches sedition and\nfree love, and they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to run him out of town.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they\xe2\x80\x99re right! They ought to run him out of town! Why, he\npreaches--if you can call it preaching--in a theater, in the House of\nSatan! You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is to find God, to find peace, to behold\nthe snares that the devil spreads out for our feet. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad to\nsee the mysterious purposes of God in having Paul harm me and stop my\nwickedness--and Paul\xe2\x80\x99s getting his, good and plenty, for the cruel\nthings he did to me, and I hope he _dies_ in prison!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt was up, hat in hand, growling, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you call\nbeing at peace, for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake just warn me before you go to war,\nwill you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nIII\n\nVast is the power of cities to reclaim the wanderer. More than mountains\nor the shore-devouring sea, a city retains its character, imperturbable,\ncynical, holding behind apparent changes its essential purpose. Though\nBabbitt had deserted his family and dwelt with Joe Paradise in the\nwilderness, though he had become a liberal, though he had been quite\nsure, on the night before he reached Zenith, that neither he nor the\ncity would be the same again, ten days after his return he could not\nbelieve that he had ever been away. Nor was it at all evident to his\nacquaintances that there was a new George F. Babbitt, save that he was\nmore irritable under the incessant chaffing at the Athletic Club, and\nonce, when Vergil Gunch observed that Seneca Doane ought to be hanged,\nBabbitt snorted, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, rats, he\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt home he grunted \xe2\x80\x9cEh?\xe2\x80\x9d across the newspaper to his commentatory wife,\nand was delighted by Tinka\xe2\x80\x99s new red tam o\xe2\x80\x99shanter, and announced, \xe2\x80\x9cNo\nclass to that corrugated iron garage. Have to build me a nice frame\none.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVerona and Kenneth Escott appeared really to be engaged. In his\nnewspaper Escott had conducted a pure-food crusade against\ncommission-houses. As a result he had been given an excellent job in a\ncommission-house, and he was making a salary on which he could marry,\nand denouncing irresponsible reporters who wrote stories criticizing\ncommission-houses without knowing what they were talking about.\n\nThis September Ted had entered the State University as a freshman in the\nCollege of Arts and Sciences. The university was at Mohalis, only\nfifteen miles from Zenith, and Ted often came down for the week-end.\nBabbitt was worried. Ted was \xe2\x80\x9cgoing in for\xe2\x80\x9d everything but books. He had\ntried to \xe2\x80\x9cmake\xe2\x80\x9d the football team as a light half-back, he was looking\nforward to the basket-ball season, he was on the committee for the\nFreshman Hop, and (as a Zenithite, an aristocrat among the yokels) he\nwas being \xe2\x80\x9crushed\xe2\x80\x9d by two fraternities. But of his studies Babbitt could\nlearn nothing save a mumbled, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, gosh, these old stiffs of teachers\njust give you a lot of junk about literature and economics.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOne week-end Ted proposed, \xe2\x80\x9cSay, Dad, why can\xe2\x80\x99t I transfer over from the\nCollege to the School of Engineering and take mechanical engineering?\nYou always holler that I never study, but honest, I would study there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, the Engineering School hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got the standing the College has,\xe2\x80\x9d\nfretted Babbitt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to know how it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t! The Engineers can play on any of the\nteams!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere was much explanation of the \xe2\x80\x9cdollars-and-cents value of being\nknown as a college man when you go into the law,\xe2\x80\x9d and a truly oratorical\naccount of the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s life. Before he was through with it, Babbitt had\nTed a United States Senator.\n\nAmong the great lawyers whom he mentioned was Seneca Doane.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, gee whiz,\xe2\x80\x9d Ted marveled, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you always said this Doane was\na reg\xe2\x80\x99lar nut!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s no way to speak of a great man! Doane\xe2\x80\x99s always been a good\nfriend of mine--fact I helped him in college-- I started him out and you\nmight say inspired him. Just because he\xe2\x80\x99s sympathetic with the aims of\nLabor, a lot of chumps that lack liberality and broad-mindedness think\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s a crank, but let me tell you there\xe2\x80\x99s mighty few of \xe2\x80\x99em that rake in\nthe fees he does, and he\xe2\x80\x99s a friend of some of the strongest, most\nconservative men in the world--like Lord Wycombe, this, uh, this big\nEnglish nobleman that\xe2\x80\x99s so well known. And you now, which would you\nrather do: be in with a lot of greasy mechanics and laboring-men, or\nchum up to a real fellow like Lord Wycombe, and get invited to his house\nfor parties?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--gosh,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Ted.\n\nThe next week-end he came in joyously with, \xe2\x80\x9cSay, Dad, why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t I\ntake mining engineering instead of the academic course? You talk about\nstanding--maybe there isn\xe2\x80\x99t much in mechanical engineering, but the\nMiners, gee, they got seven out of eleven in the new elections to Nu Tau\nTau!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n\nI\n\nThe strike which turned Zenith into two belligerent camps, white and\nred, began late in September with a walk-out of telephone girls and\nlinemen, in protest against a reduction of wages. The newly formed union\nof dairy-products workers went out, partly in sympathy and partly in\ndemand for a forty-four hour week. They were followed by the\ntruck-drivers\xe2\x80\x99 union. Industry was tied up, and the whole city was\nnervous with talk of a trolley strike, a printers\xe2\x80\x99 strike, a general\nstrike. Furious citizens, trying to get telephone calls through\nstrike-breaking girls, danced helplessly. Every truck that made its way\nfrom the factories to the freight-stations was guarded by a policeman,\ntrying to look stoical beside the scab driver. A line of fifty trucks\nfrom the Zenith Steel and Machinery Company was attacked by\nstrikers--rushing out from the sidewalk, pulling drivers from the seats,\nsmashing carburetors and commutators, while telephone girls cheered from\nthe walk, and small boys heaved bricks.\n\nThe National Guard was ordered out. Colonel Nixon, who in private life\nwas Mr. Caleb Nixon, secretary of the Pullmore Tractor Company, put on a\nlong khaki coat and stalked through crowds, a .44 automatic in hand.\nEven Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s friend, Clarence Drum the shoe merchant--a round and\nmerry man who told stories at the Athletic Club, and who strangely\nresembled a Victorian pug-dog--was to be seen as a waddling but\nferocious captain, with his belt tight about his comfortable little\nbelly, and his round little mouth petulant as he piped to chattering\ngroups on corners. \xe2\x80\x9cMove on there now! I can\xe2\x80\x99t have any of this\nloitering!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEvery newspaper in the city, save one, was against the strikers. When\nmobs raided the news-stands, at each was stationed a militiaman, a\nyoung, embarrassed citizen-soldier with eye-glasses, bookkeeper or\ngrocery-clerk in private life, trying to look dangerous while small boys\nyelped, \xe2\x80\x9cGet onto de tin soldier!\xe2\x80\x9d and striking truck-drivers inquired\ntenderly, \xe2\x80\x9cSay, Joe, when I was fighting in France, was you in camp in\nthe States or was you doing Swede exercises in the Y. M. C. A.? Be\ncareful of that bayonet, now, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll cut yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere was no one in Zenith who talked of anything but the strike, and no\none who did not take sides. You were either a courageous friend of\nLabor, or you were a fearless supporter of the Rights of Property; and\nin either case you were belligerent, and ready to disown any friend who\ndid not hate the enemy.\n\nA condensed-milk plant was set afire--each side charged it to the\nother--and the city was hysterical.\n\nAnd Babbitt chose this time to be publicly liberal.\n\nHe belonged to the sound, sane, right-thinking wing, and at first he\nagreed that the Crooked Agitators ought to be shot. He was sorry when\nhis friend, Seneca Doane, defended arrested strikers, and he thought of\ngoing to Doane and explaining about these agitators, but when he read a\nbroadside alleging that even on their former wages the telephone girls\nhad been hungry, he was troubled. \xe2\x80\x9cAll lies and fake figures,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\nbut in a doubtful croak.\n\nFor the Sunday after, the Chatham Road Presbyterian Church announced a\nsermon by Dr. John Jennison Drew on \xe2\x80\x9cHow the Saviour Would End Strikes.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBabbitt had been negligent about church-going lately, but he went to the\nservice, hopeful that Dr. Drew really did have the information as to\nwhat the divine powers thought about strikes. Beside Babbitt in the\nlarge, curving, glossy, velvet-upholstered pew was Chum Frink.\n\nFrink whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cHope the doc gives the strikers hell! Ordinarily, I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t believe in a preacher butting into political matters--let him\nstick to straight religion and save souls, and not stir up a lot of\ndiscussion--but at a time like this, I do think he ought to stand right\nup and bawl out those plug-uglies to a fare-you-well!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--well--\xe2\x80\x9d said Babbitt.\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Drew, his rustic bang flopping with the intensity of his\npoetic and sociologic ardor, trumpeted:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuring the untoward series of industrial dislocations which have--let\nus be courageous and admit it boldly--throttled the business life of our\nfair city these past days, there has been a great deal of loose talk\nabout scientific prevention of scientific--_scientific!_ Now, let me\ntell you that the most unscientific thing in the world is science! Take\nthe attacks on the established fundamentals of the Christian creed which\nwere so popular with the \xe2\x80\x98scientists\xe2\x80\x99 a generation ago. Oh, yes, they\nwere mighty fellows, and great poo-bahs of criticism! They were going to\ndestroy the church; they were going to prove the world was created and\nhas been brought to its extraordinary level of morality and civilization\nby blind chance. Yet the church stands just as firmly to-day as ever,\nand the only answer a Christian pastor needs make to the long-haired\nopponents of his simple faith is just a pitying smile!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now these same \xe2\x80\x98scientists\xe2\x80\x99 want to replace the natural condition\nof free competition by crazy systems which, no matter by what\nhigh-sounding names they are called, are nothing but a despotic\npaternalism. Naturally, I\xe2\x80\x99m not criticizing labor courts, injunctions\nagainst men proven to be striking unjustly, or those excellent unions in\nwhich the men and the boss get together. But I certainly am criticizing\nthe systems in which the free and fluid motivation of independent labor\nis to be replaced by cooked-up wage-scales and minimum salaries and\ngovernment commissions and labor federations and all that poppycock.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is not generally understood is that this whole industrial matter\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t a question of economics. It\xe2\x80\x99s essentially and only a matter of\nLove, and of the practical application of the Christian religion!\nImagine a factory--instead of committees of workmen alienating the boss,\nthe boss goes among them smiling, and they smile back, the elder brother\nand the younger. Brothers, that\xe2\x80\x99s what they must be, loving brothers,\nand then strikes would be as inconceivable as hatred in the home!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was at this point that Babbitt muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, rot!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh?\xe2\x80\x9d said Chum Frink.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about. It\xe2\x80\x99s just as clear as mud. It\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean a darn thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe, but--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFrink looked at him doubtfully, through all the service kept glancing at\nhim doubtfully, till Babbitt was nervous.\n\n\nII\n\nThe strikers had announced a parade for Tuesday morning, but Colonel\nNixon had forbidden it, the newspapers said. When Babbitt drove west\nfrom his office at ten that morning, he saw a drove of shabby men\nheading toward the tangled, dirty district beyond Court House Square. He\nhated them, because they were poor, because they made him feel insecure.\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn loafers! Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be common workmen if they had any pep,\xe2\x80\x9d he\ncomplained. He wondered if there was going to be a riot. He drove toward\nthe starting-point of the parade, a triangle of limp and faded grass\nknown as Moore Street Park, and halted his car.\n\nThe park and streets were buzzing with strikers, young men in blue denim\nshirts, old men with caps. Through them, keeping them stirred like a\nboiling pot, moved the militiamen. Babbitt could hear the soldiers\xe2\x80\x99\nmonotonous orders: \xe2\x80\x9cKeep moving--move on, \xe2\x80\x99bo--keep your feet warm!\xe2\x80\x9d\nBabbitt admired their stolid good temper. The crowd shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cTin\nsoldiers,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cDirty dogs--servants of the capitalists!\xe2\x80\x9d but the\nmilitiamen grinned and answered only, \xe2\x80\x9cSure, that\xe2\x80\x99s right. Keep moving,\nBilly!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt thrilled over the citizen-soldiers, hated the scoundrels who\nwere obstructing the pleasant ways of prosperity, admired Colonel\nNixon\xe2\x80\x99s striding contempt for the crowd; and as Captain Clarence Drum,\nthat rather puffing shoe-dealer, came raging by, Babbitt respectfully\nclamored, \xe2\x80\x9cGreat work, Captain! Don\xe2\x80\x99t let \xe2\x80\x99em march!\xe2\x80\x9d He watched the\nstrikers filing from the park. Many of them bore posters with \xe2\x80\x9cThey\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t stop our peacefully walking.\xe2\x80\x9d The militiamen tore away the\nposters, but the strikers fell in behind their leaders and straggled\noff, a thin unimpressive trickle between steel-glinting lines of\nsoldiers. Babbitt saw with disappointment that there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be\nany violence, nothing interesting at all. Then he gasped.\n\nAmong the marchers, beside a bulky young workman, was Seneca Doane,\nsmiling, content. In front of him was Professor Brockbank, head of the\nhistory department in the State University, an old man and\nwhite-bearded, known to come from a distinguished Massachusetts family.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, gosh,\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt marveled, \xe2\x80\x9ca swell like him in with the strikers?\nAnd good ole Senny Doane! They\xe2\x80\x99re fools to get mixed up with this bunch.\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re parlor socialists! But they have got nerve. And nothing in it\nfor them, not a cent! And-- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know \xe2\x80\x99s _all_ the strikers look like\nsuch tough nuts. Look just about like anybody else to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe militiamen were turning the parade down a side street.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey got just as much right to march as anybody else! They own the\nstreets as much as Clarence Drum or the American Legion does!\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt\ngrumbled. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, they\xe2\x80\x99re--they\xe2\x80\x99re a bad element, but-- Oh, rats!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt the Athletic Club, Babbitt was silent during lunch, while the others\nfretted, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the world\xe2\x80\x99s coming to,\xe2\x80\x9d or solaced their\nspirits with \xe2\x80\x9ckidding.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCaptain Clarence Drum came swinging by, splendid in khaki.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s it going, Captain?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Vergil Gunch.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we got \xe2\x80\x99em stopped. We worked \xe2\x80\x99em off on side streets and separated\n\xe2\x80\x99em and they got discouraged and went home.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine work. No violence.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine work nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned Mr. Drum. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had my way, there\xe2\x80\x99d be a\nwhole lot of violence, and I\xe2\x80\x99d start it, and then the whole thing would\nbe over. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in standing back and wet-nursing these fellows\nand letting the disturbances drag on. I tell you these strikers are\nnothing in God\xe2\x80\x99s world but a lot of bomb-throwing socialists and thugs,\nand the only way to handle \xe2\x80\x99em is with a club! That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99d do; beat\nup the whole lot of \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt heard himself saying, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, rats, Clarence, they look just about\nlike you and me, and I certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice any bombs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDrum complained, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t, eh? Well, maybe you\xe2\x80\x99d like to take\ncharge of the strike! Just tell Colonel Nixon what innocents the\nstrikers are! He\xe2\x80\x99d be glad to hear about it!\xe2\x80\x9d Drum strode on, while all\nthe table stared at Babbitt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the idea? Do you want us to give those hell-hounds love and\nkisses, or what?\xe2\x80\x9d said Orville Jones.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you defend a lot of hoodlums that are trying to take the bread and\nbutter away from our families?\xe2\x80\x9d raged Professor Pumphrey.\n\nVergil Gunch intimidatingly said nothing. He put on sternness like a\nmask; his jaw was hard, his bristly short hair seemed cruel, his silence\nwas a ferocious thunder. While the others assured Babbitt that they must\nhave misunderstood him, Gunch looked as though he had understood only\ntoo well. Like a robed judge he listened to Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s stammering:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sure; course they\xe2\x80\x99re a bunch of toughs. But I just mean-- Strikes me\nit\xe2\x80\x99s bad policy to talk about clubbing \xe2\x80\x99em. Cabe Nixon doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. He\xe2\x80\x99s got\nthe fine Italian hand. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s colonel. Clarence Drum is\njealous of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Professor Pumphrey, \xe2\x80\x9cyou hurt Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, George.\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s been out there all morning getting hot and dusty, and no wonder he\nwants to beat the tar out of those sons of guns!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGunch said nothing, and watched; and Babbitt knew that he was being\nwatched.\n\n\nIII\n\nAs he was leaving the club Babbitt heard Chum Frink protesting to Gunch,\n\xe2\x80\x9c--don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s got into him. Last Sunday Doc Drew preached a\ncorking sermon about decency in business and Babbitt kicked about that,\ntoo. Near\xe2\x80\x99s I can figure out--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt was vaguely frightened.\n\n\nIV\n\nHe saw a crowd listening to a man who was talking from the rostrum of a\nkitchen-chair. He stopped his car. From newspaper pictures he knew that\nthe speaker must be the notorious freelance preacher, Beecher Ingram, of\nwhom Seneca Doane had spoken. Ingram was a gaunt man with flamboyant\nhair, weather-beaten cheeks, and worried eyes. He was pleading:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c--if those telephone girls can hold out, living on one meal a day,\ndoing their own washing, starving and smiling, you big hulking men ought\nto be able--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt saw that from the sidewalk Vergil Gunch was watching him. In\nvague disquiet he started the car and mechanically drove on, while\nGunch\xe2\x80\x99s hostile eyes seemed to follow him all the way.\n\n\nV\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of these fellows,\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt was complaining to his wife,\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat think if workmen go on strike they\xe2\x80\x99re a regular bunch of fiends.\nNow, of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fight between sound business and the destructive\nelement, and we got to lick the stuffin\xe2\x80\x99s out of \xe2\x80\x99em when they challenge\nus, but doggoned if I see why we can\xe2\x80\x99t fight like gentlemen and not go\ncalling \xe2\x80\x99em dirty dogs and saying they ought to be shot down.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, George,\xe2\x80\x9d she said placidly, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you always insisted that\nall strikers ought to be put in jail.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never did! Well, I mean-- Some of \xe2\x80\x99em, of course. Irresponsible\nleaders. But I mean a fellow ought to be broad-minded and liberal about\nthings like--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut dearie, I thought you always said these so-called \xe2\x80\x98liberal\xe2\x80\x99 people\nwere the worst of--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRats! Woman never can understand the different definitions of a word.\nDepends on how you mean it. And it don\xe2\x80\x99t pay to be too cocksure about\nanything. Now, these strikers: Honest, they\xe2\x80\x99re not such bad people. Just\nfoolish. They don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the complications of merchandizing and\nprofit, the way we business men do, but sometimes I think they\xe2\x80\x99re about\nlike the rest of us, and no more hogs for wages than we are for\nprofits.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge! If people were to hear you talk like that--of course I _know_\nyou; I remember what a wild crazy boy you were; I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean a\nword you say--but if people that didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand you were to hear you\ntalking, they\xe2\x80\x99d think you were a regular socialist!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I care what anybody thinks? And let me tell you right now-- I\nwant you to distinctly understand I never was a wild crazy kid, and when\nI say a thing, I mean it, and I stand by it and-- Honest, do you think\npeople would think I was too liberal if I just said the strikers were\ndecent?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course they would. But don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, dear; I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean a\nword of it. Time to trot up to bed now. Have you enough covers for\nto-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn the sleeping-porch he puzzled, \xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand me. Hardly\nunderstand myself. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t I take things easy, way I used to?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWish I could go out to Senny Doane\xe2\x80\x99s house and talk things over with\nhim. No! Suppose Verg Gunch saw me going in there!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWish I knew some really smart woman, and nice, that would see what I\xe2\x80\x99m\ntrying to get at, and let me talk to her and-- I wonder if Myra\xe2\x80\x99s right?\nCould the fellows think I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone nutty just because I\xe2\x80\x99m broad-minded\nand liberal? Way Verg looked at me--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n\nMiss McGoun came into his private office at three in the afternoon with\n\xe2\x80\x9cLissen, Mr. Babbitt; there\xe2\x80\x99s a Mrs. Judique on the \xe2\x80\x99phone--wants to see\nabout some repairs, and the salesmen are all out. Want to talk to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe voice of Tanis Judique was clear and pleasant. The black cylinder of\nthe telephone-receiver seemed to hold a tiny animated image of her:\nlustrous eyes, delicate nose, gentle chin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Mrs. Judique. Do you remember me? You drove me up here to the\nCavendish Apartments and helped me find such a nice flat.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure! Bet I remember! What can I do for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a little-- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I ought to bother you, but\nthe janitor doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be able to fix it. You know my flat is on\nthe top floor, and with these autumn rains the roof is beginning to\nleak, and I\xe2\x80\x99d be awfully glad if--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure! I\xe2\x80\x99ll come up and take a look at it.\xe2\x80\x9d Nervously, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen do you\nexpect to be in?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I\xe2\x80\x99m in every morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe in this afternoon, in an hour or so?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe-es. Perhaps I could give you a cup of tea. I think I ought to, after\nall your trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine! I\xe2\x80\x99ll run up there soon as I can get away.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe meditated, \xe2\x80\x9cNow there\xe2\x80\x99s a woman that\xe2\x80\x99s got refinement, savvy,\n_class_! \xe2\x80\x98After all your trouble--give you a cup of tea.\xe2\x80\x99 She\xe2\x80\x99d\nappreciate a fellow. I\xe2\x80\x99m a fool, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not such a bad cuss, get to\nknow me. And not so much a fool as they think!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe great strike was over, the strikers beaten. Except that Vergil Gunch\nseemed less cordial, there were no visible effects of Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s\ntreachery to the clan. The oppressive fear of criticism was gone, but a\ndiffident loneliness remained. Now he was so exhilarated that, to prove\nhe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, he droned about the office for fifteen minutes, looking at\nblue-prints, explaining to Miss McGoun that this Mrs. Scott wanted more\nmoney for her house--had raised the asking-price--raised it from seven\nthousand to eighty-five hundred--would Miss McGoun be sure and put it\ndown on the card--Mrs. Scott\xe2\x80\x99s house--raise. When he had thus\nestablished himself as a person unemotional and interested only in\nbusiness, he sauntered out. He took a particularly long time to start\nhis car; he kicked the tires, dusted the glass of the speedometer, and\ntightened the screws holding the wind-shield spot-light.\n\nHe drove happily off toward the Bellevue district, conscious of the\npresence of Mrs. Judique as of a brilliant light on the horizon. The\nmaple leaves had fallen and they lined the gutters of the asphalted\nstreets. It was a day of pale gold and faded green, tranquil and\nlingering. Babbitt was aware of the meditative day, and of the\nbarrenness of Bellevue--blocks of wooden houses, garages, little shops,\nweedy lots. \xe2\x80\x9cNeeds pepping up; needs the touch that people like Mrs.\nJudique could give a place,\xe2\x80\x9d he ruminated, as he rattled through the\nlong, crude, airy streets. The wind rose, enlivening, keen, and in a\nblaze of well-being he came to the flat of Tanis Judique.\n\nShe was wearing, when she flutteringly admitted him, a frock of black\nchiffon cut modestly round at the base of her pretty throat. She seemed\nto him immensely sophisticated. He glanced at the cretonnes and colored\nprints in her living-room, and gurgled, \xe2\x80\x9cGosh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve fixed the place\nnice! Takes a clever woman to know how to make a home, all right!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou really like it? I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad! But you\xe2\x80\x99ve neglected me, scandalously.\nYou promised to come some time and learn to dance.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRather unsteadily, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, but you didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it seriously!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not. But you might have tried!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, here I\xe2\x80\x99ve come for my lesson, and you might just as well prepare\nto have me stay for supper!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey both laughed in a manner which indicated that of course he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nmean it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut first I guess I better look at that leak.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe climbed with him to the flat roof of the apartment-house--a detached\nworld of slatted wooden walks, clotheslines, water-tank in a penthouse.\nHe poked at things with his toe, and sought to impress her by being\nlearned about copper gutters, the desirability of passing plumbing pipes\nthrough a lead collar and sleeve and flashing them with copper, and the\nadvantages of cedar over boiler-iron for roof-tanks.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to know so much, in real estate!\xe2\x80\x9d she admired.\n\nHe promised that the roof should be repaired within two days. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\nmind my \xe2\x80\x99phoning from your apartment?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeavens, no!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe stood a moment at the coping, looking over a land of hard little\nbungalows with abnormally large porches, and new apartment-houses,\nsmall, but brave with variegated brick walls and terra-cotta trimmings.\nBeyond them was a hill with a gouge of yellow clay like a vast wound.\nBehind every apartment-house, beside each dwelling, were small garages.\nIt was a world of good little people, comfortable, industrious,\ncredulous.\n\nIn the autumnal light the flat newness was mellowed, and the air was a\nsun-tinted pool.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGolly, it\xe2\x80\x99s one fine afternoon. You get a great view here, right up\nTanner\xe2\x80\x99s Hill,\xe2\x80\x9d said Babbitt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it nice and open.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo darn few people appreciate a View.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you go raising my rent on that account! Oh, that was naughty of\nme! I was just teasing. Seriously though, there are so few who\nrespond--who react to Views. I mean--they haven\xe2\x80\x99t any feeling of poetry\nand beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fact, they haven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he breathed, admiring her slenderness and\nthe absorbed, airy way in which she looked toward the hill, chin lifted,\nlips smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, guess I\xe2\x80\x99d better telephone the plumbers, so they\xe2\x80\x99ll\nget on the job first thing in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen he had telephoned, making it conspicuously authoritative and gruff\nand masculine, he looked doubtful, and sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x99pose I\xe2\x80\x99d better be--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you must have that cup of tea first!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it would go pretty good, at that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was luxurious to loll in a deep green rep chair, his legs thrust out\nbefore him, to glance at the black Chinese telephone stand and the\ncolored photograph of Mount Vernon which he had always liked so much,\nwhile in the tiny kitchen--so near--Mrs. Judique sang \xe2\x80\x9cMy Creole Queen.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn an intolerable sweetness, a contentment so deep that he was wistfully\ndiscontented, he saw magnolias by moonlight and heard plantation darkies\ncrooning to the banjo. He wanted to be near her, on pretense of helping\nher, yet he wanted to remain in this still ecstasy. Languidly he\nremained.\n\nWhen she bustled in with the tea he smiled up at her. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is awfully\nnice!\xe2\x80\x9d For the first time, he was not fencing; he was quietly and\nsecurely friendly; and friendly and quiet was her answer: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nice to\nhave you here. You were so kind, helping me to find this little home.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey agreed that the weather would soon turn cold. They agreed that\nprohibition was prohibitive. They agreed that art in the home was\ncultural. They agreed about everything. They even became bold. They\nhinted that these modern young girls, well, honestly, their short skirts\nwere short. They were proud to find that they were not shocked by such\nfrank speaking. Tanis ventured, \xe2\x80\x9cI know you\xe2\x80\x99ll understand-- I mean-- I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t quite know how to say it, but I do think that girls who pretend\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re bad by the way they dress really never go any farther. They give\naway the fact that they haven\xe2\x80\x99t the instincts of a womanly woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRemembering Ida Putiak, the manicure girl, and how ill she had used him,\nBabbitt agreed with enthusiasm; remembering how ill all the world had\nused him, he told of Paul Riesling, of Zilla, of Seneca Doane, of the\nstrike:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee how it was? Course I was as anxious to have those beggars licked to\na standstill as anybody else, but gosh, no reason for not seeing their\nside. For a fellow\xe2\x80\x99s own sake, he\xe2\x80\x99s got to be broad-minded and liberal,\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I do!\xe2\x80\x9d Sitting on the hard little couch, she clasped her hands\nbeside her, leaned toward him, absorbed him; and in a glorious state of\nbeing appreciated he proclaimed:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I up and said to the fellows at the club, \xe2\x80\x98Look here,\xe2\x80\x99 I--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you belong to the Union Club? I think it\xe2\x80\x99s--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; the Athletic. Tell you: Course they\xe2\x80\x99re always asking me to join the\nUnion, but I always say, \xe2\x80\x98No, sir! Nothing doing!\xe2\x80\x99 I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the\nexpense but I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand all the old fogies.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s so. But tell me: what did you say to them?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear it. I\xe2\x80\x99m probably boring you to death with my\ntroubles! You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly think I was an old duffer; I sound like a\nkid!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99re a boy yet. I mean--you can\xe2\x80\x99t be a day over forty-five.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m not--much. But by golly I begin to feel middle-aged\nsometimes; all these responsibilities and all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know!\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice caressed him; it cloaked him like warm silk.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I feel lonely, so lonely, some days, Mr. Babbitt.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re a sad pair of birds! But I think we\xe2\x80\x99re pretty darn nice!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re lots nicer than most people I know!\xe2\x80\x9d They smiled.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut please tell me what you said at the Club.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it was like this: Course Seneca Doane is a friend of mine--they\ncan say what they want to, they can call him anything they please, but\nwhat most folks here don\xe2\x80\x99t know is that Senny is the bosom pal of some\nof the biggest statesmen in the world--Lord Wycombe, frinstance--you\nknow, this big British nobleman. My friend Sir Gerald Doak told me that\nLord Wycombe is one of the biggest guns in England--well, Doak or\nsomebody told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Do you know Sir Gerald? The one that was here, at the McKelveys\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow him? Well, say, I know him just well enough so we call each other\nGeorge and Jerry, and we got so pickled together in Chicago--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat must have been fun. But--\xe2\x80\x9d She shook a finger at him. \xe2\x80\x9c--I can\xe2\x80\x99t\nhave you getting pickled! I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take you in hand!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWish you would!... Well, zize saying: You see I happen to know what a\nbig noise Senny Doane is outside of Zenith, but of course a prophet\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t got any honor in his own country, and Senny, darn his old hide,\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s so blame modest that he never lets folks know the kind of an outfit\nhe travels with when he goes abroad. Well, during the strike Clarence\nDrum comes pee-rading up to our table, all dolled up fit to kill in his\nnice lil cap\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99s uniform, and somebody says to him, \xe2\x80\x98Busting the strike,\nClarence?\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he swells up like a pouter-pigeon and he hollers, so\xe2\x80\x99s you could\nhear him way up in the reading-room, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, sure; I told the\nstrike-leaders where they got off, and so they went home.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 I says to him, \xe2\x80\x98glad there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any violence.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98but if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t kept my eye skinned there would\xe2\x80\x99ve\nbeen. All those fellows had bombs in their pockets. They\xe2\x80\x99re reg\xe2\x80\x99lar\nanarchists.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Oh, rats, Clarence,\xe2\x80\x99 I says, \xe2\x80\x98I looked \xe2\x80\x99em all over carefully, and\nthey didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any more bombs \xe2\x80\x99n a rabbit,\xe2\x80\x99 I says. \xe2\x80\x98Course,\xe2\x80\x99 I says,\n\xe2\x80\x98they\xe2\x80\x99re foolish, but they\xe2\x80\x99re a good deal like you and me, after all.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then Vergil Gunch or somebody--no, it was Chum Frink--you know,\nthis famous poet--great pal of mine--he says to me, \xe2\x80\x98Look here,\xe2\x80\x99 he\nsays, \xe2\x80\x98do you mean to say you advocate these strikes?\xe2\x80\x99 Well, I was so\ndisgusted with a fellow whose mind worked that way that I swear, I had a\ngood mind to not explain at all--just ignore him--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s so wise!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Judique.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c--but finally I explains to him: \xe2\x80\x98If you\xe2\x80\x99d done as much as I have on\nChamber of Commerce committees and all,\xe2\x80\x99 I says, \xe2\x80\x98then you\xe2\x80\x99d have the\nright to talk! But same time,\xe2\x80\x99 I says, \xe2\x80\x98I believe in treating your\nopponent like a gentleman!\xe2\x80\x99 Well, sir, that held \xe2\x80\x99em! Frink--Chum I\nalways call him--he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have another word to say. But at that, I\nguess some of \xe2\x80\x99em kind o\xe2\x80\x99 thought I was too liberal. What do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you were so wise. And courageous! I love a man to have the courage\nof his convictions!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do you think it was a good stunt? After all, some of these fellows\nare so darn cautious and narrow-minded that they\xe2\x80\x99re prejudiced against a\nfellow that talks right out in meeting.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you care? In the long run they\xe2\x80\x99re bound to respect a man who\nmakes them think, and with your reputation for oratory you--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you know about my reputation for oratory?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to tell you everything I know! But seriously, you\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t realize what a famous man you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell-- Though I haven\xe2\x80\x99t done much orating this fall. Too kind of\nbothered by this Paul Riesling business, I guess. But-- Do you know,\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re the first person that\xe2\x80\x99s really understood what I was getting at,\nTanis-- Listen to me, will you! Fat nerve I\xe2\x80\x99ve got, calling you Tanis!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do! And shall I call you George? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it\xe2\x80\x99s awfully nice\nwhen two people have so much--what shall I call it?--so much analysis\nthat they can discard all these stupid conventions and understand each\nother and become acquainted right away, like ships that pass in the\nnight?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly do! I certainly do!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe was no longer quiescent in his chair; he wandered about the room, he\ndropped on the couch beside her. But as he awkwardly stretched his hand\ntoward her fragile, immaculate fingers, she said brightly, \xe2\x80\x9cDo give me a\ncigarette. Would you think poor Tanis was dreadfully naughty if she\nsmoked?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, no! I like it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe had often and weightily pondered flappers smoking in Zenith\nrestaurants, but he knew only one woman who smoked--Mrs. Sam Doppelbrau,\nhis flighty neighbor. He ceremoniously lighted Tanis\xe2\x80\x99s cigarette, looked\nfor a place to deposit the burnt match, and dropped it into his pocket.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you want a cigar, you poor man!\xe2\x80\x9d she crooned.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mind one?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no! I love the smell of a good cigar; so nice and--so nice and like\na man. You\xe2\x80\x99ll find an ash-tray in my bedroom, on the table beside the\nbed, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind getting it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe was embarrassed by her bedroom: the broad couch with a cover of\nviolet silk, mauve curtains striped with gold, Chinese Chippendale\nbureau, and an amazing row of slippers, with ribbon-wound shoe-trees,\nand primrose stockings lying across them. His manner of bringing the\nash-tray had just the right note of easy friendliness, he felt. \xe2\x80\x9cA boob\nlike Verg Gunch would try to get funny about seeing her bedroom, but I\ntake it casually.\xe2\x80\x9d He was not casual afterward. The contentment of\ncompanionship was gone, and he was restless with desire to touch her\nhand. But whenever he turned toward her, the cigarette was in his way.\nIt was a shield between them. He waited till she should have finished,\nbut as he rejoiced at her quick crushing of its light on the ash-tray\nshe said, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you want to give me another cigarette?\xe2\x80\x9d and hopelessly\nhe saw the screen of pale smoke and her graceful tilted hand again\nbetween them. He was not merely curious now to find out whether she\nwould let him hold her hand (all in the purest friendship, naturally),\nbut agonized with need of it.\n\nOn the surface appeared none of all this fretful drama. They were\ntalking cheerfully of motors, of trips to California, of Chum Frink.\nOnce he said delicately, \xe2\x80\x9cI do hate these guys-- I hate these people that\ninvite themselves to meals, but I seem to have a feeling I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\nhave supper with the lovely Mrs. Tanis Judique to-night. But I suppose\nyou probably have seven dates already.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I was thinking some of going to the movies. Yes, I really think I\nought to get out and get some fresh air.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe did not encourage him to stay, but never did she discourage him. He\nconsidered, \xe2\x80\x9cI better take a sneak! She _will_ let me stay--there _is_\nsomething doing--and I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t get mixed up with-- I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t-- I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\nbeat it.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s too late now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSuddenly, at seven, brushing her cigarette away, brusquely taking her\nhand:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTanis! Stop teasing me! You know we-- Here we are, a couple of lonely\nbirds, and we\xe2\x80\x99re awful happy together. Anyway I am! Never been so happy!\nDo let me stay! I\xe2\x80\x99ll gallop down to the delicatessen and buy some\nstuff--cold chicken maybe--or cold turkey--and we can have a nice little\nsupper, and afterwards, if you want to chase me out, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be good and go\nlike a lamb.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--yes--it would be nice,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\nNor did she withdraw her hand. He squeezed it, trembling, and blundered\ntoward his coat. At the delicatessen he bought preposterous stores of\nfood, chosen on the principle of expensiveness. From the drug store\nacross the street he telephoned to his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cGot to get a fellow to\nsign a lease before he leaves town on the midnight. Won\xe2\x80\x99t be home till\nlate. Don\xe2\x80\x99t wait up for me. Kiss Tinka good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d He expectantly\nlumbered back to the flat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you bad thing, to buy so much food!\xe2\x80\x9d was her greeting, and her\nvoice was gay, her smile acceptant.\n\nHe helped her in the tiny white kitchen; he washed the lettuce, he\nopened the olive bottle. She ordered him to set the table, and as he\ntrotted into the living-room, as he hunted through the buffet for knives\nand forks, he felt utterly at home.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow the only other thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced, \xe2\x80\x9cis what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to wear.\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t decide whether you\xe2\x80\x99re to put on your swellest evening gown, or\nlet your hair down and put on short skirts and make-believe you\xe2\x80\x99re a\nlittle girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to dine just as I am, in this old chiffon rag, and if you\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t stand poor Tanis that way, you can go to the club for dinner!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand you!\xe2\x80\x9d He patted her shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cChild, you\xe2\x80\x99re the brainiest and\nthe loveliest and finest woman I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever met! Come now, Lady Wycombe, if\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll take the Duke of Zenith\xe2\x80\x99s arm, we will proambulate in to the\nmagnolious feed!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you do say the funniest, nicest things!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen they had finished the picnic supper he thrust his head out of the\nwindow and reported, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s turned awful chilly, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s going\nto rain. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to the movies.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish we had a fireplace! I wish it was raining like all get-out\nto-night, and we were in a funny little old-fashioned cottage, and the\ntrees thrashing like everything outside, and a great big log fire\nand-- I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you! Let\xe2\x80\x99s draw this couch up to the radiator, and\nstretch our feet out, and pretend it\xe2\x80\x99s a wood-fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s pathetic! You big child!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut they did draw up to the radiator, and propped their feet against\nit--his clumsy black shoes, her patent-leather slippers. In the dimness\nthey talked of themselves; of how lonely she was, how bewildered he, and\nhow wonderful that they had found each other. As they fell silent the\nroom was stiller than a country lane. There was no sound from the street\nsave the whir of motor-tires, the rumble of a distant freight-train.\nSelf-contained was the room, warm, secure, insulated from the harassing\nworld.\n\nHe was absorbed by a rapture in which all fear and doubting were\nsmoothed away; and when he reached home, at dawn, the rapture had\nmellowed to contentment serene and full of memories.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n\nI\n\nThe assurance of Tanis Judique\xe2\x80\x99s friendship fortified Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s\nself-approval. At the Athletic Club he became experimental. Though\nVergil Gunch was silent, the others at the Roughnecks\xe2\x80\x99 Table came to\naccept Babbitt as having, for no visible reason, \xe2\x80\x9cturned crank.\xe2\x80\x9d They\nargued windily with him, and he was cocky, and enjoyed the spectacle of\nhis interesting martyrdom. He even praised Seneca Doane. Professor\nPumphrey said that was carrying a joke too far; but Babbitt argued, \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\nFact! I tell you he\xe2\x80\x99s got one of the keenest intellects in the country.\nWhy, Lord Wycombe said that--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, who the hell is Lord Wycombe? What you always lugging him in for?\nYou been touting him for the last six weeks!\xe2\x80\x9d protested Orville Jones.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge ordered him from Sears-Roebuck. You can get those English\nhigh-muckamucks by mail for two bucks apiece,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Sidney\nFinkelstein.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right now! Lord Wycombe, he\xe2\x80\x99s one of the biggest intellects\nin English political life. As I was saying: Of course I\xe2\x80\x99m conservative\nmyself, but I appreciate a guy like Senny Doane because--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVergil Gunch interrupted harshly, \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if you are so conservative?\nI find I can manage to run my own business without any skunks and reds\nlike Doane in it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe grimness of Gunch\xe2\x80\x99s voice, the hardness of his jaw, disconcerted\nBabbitt, but he recovered and went on till they looked bored, then\nirritated, then as doubtful as Gunch.\n\n\nII\n\nHe thought of Tanis always. With a stir he remembered her every aspect.\nHis arms yearned for her. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve found her! I\xe2\x80\x99ve dreamed of her all these\nyears and now I\xe2\x80\x99ve found her!\xe2\x80\x9d he exulted. He met her at the movies in\nthe morning; he drove out to her flat in the late afternoon or on\nevenings when he was believed to be at the Elks. He knew her financial\naffairs and advised her about them, while she lamented her feminine\nignorance, and praised his masterfulness, and proved to know much more\nabout bonds than he did. They had remembrances, and laughter over old\ntimes. Once they quarreled, and he raged that she was as \xe2\x80\x9cbossy\xe2\x80\x9d as his\nwife and far more whining when he was inattentive. But that passed\nsafely.\n\nTheir high hour was a tramp on a ringing December afternoon, through\nsnow-drifted meadows down to the icy Chaloosa River. She was exotic in\nan astrachan cap and a short beaver coat; she slid on the ice and\nshouted, and he panted after her, rotund with laughter.... Myra Babbitt\nnever slid on the ice.\n\nHe was afraid that they would be seen together. In Zenith it is\nimpossible to lunch with a neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s wife without the fact being known,\nbefore nightfall, in every house in your circle. But Tanis was\nbeautifully discreet. However appealingly she might turn to him when\nthey were alone, she was gravely detached when they were abroad, and he\nhoped that she would be taken for a client. Orville Jones once saw them\nemerging from a movie theater, and Babbitt bumbled, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me make you\n\xe2\x80\x99quainted with Mrs. Judique. Now here\xe2\x80\x99s a lady who knows the right\nbroker to come to, Orvy!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Jones, though he was a man censorious of\nmorals and of laundry machinery, seemed satisfied.\n\nHis predominant fear--not from any especial fondness for her but from\nthe habit of propriety--was that his wife would learn of the affair. He\nwas certain that she knew nothing specific about Tanis, but he was also\ncertain that she suspected something indefinite. For years she had been\nbored by anything more affectionate than a farewell kiss, yet she was\nhurt by any slackening in his irritable periodic interest, and now he\nhad no interest; rather, a revulsion. He was completely faithful--to\nTanis. He was distressed by the sight of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s slack plumpness, by\nher puffs and billows of flesh, by the tattered petticoat which she was\nalways meaning and always forgetting to throw away. But he was aware\nthat she, so long attuned to him, caught all his repulsions. He\nelaborately, heavily, jocularly tried to check them. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\nThey had a tolerable Christmas. Kenneth Escott was there, admittedly\nengaged to Verona. Mrs. Babbitt was tearful and called Kenneth her new\nson. Babbitt was worried about Ted, because he had ceased complaining of\nthe State University and become suspiciously acquiescent. He wondered\nwhat the boy was planning, and was too shy to ask. Himself, Babbitt\nslipped away on Christmas afternoon to take his present, a silver\ncigarette-box, to Tanis. When he returned Mrs. Babbitt asked, much too\ninnocently, \xe2\x80\x9cDid you go out for a little fresh air?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, just lil drive,\xe2\x80\x9d he mumbled.\n\nAfter New Year\xe2\x80\x99s his wife proposed, \xe2\x80\x9cI heard from my sister to-day,\nGeorge. She isn\xe2\x80\x99t well. I think perhaps I ought to go stay with her for\na few weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNow, Mrs. Babbitt was not accustomed to leave home during the winter\nexcept on violently demanding occasions, and only the summer before, she\nhad been gone for weeks. Nor was Babbitt one of the detachable husbands\nwho take separations casually. He liked to have her there; she looked\nafter his clothes; she knew how his steak ought to be cooked; and her\nclucking made him feel secure. But he could not drum up even a dutiful\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really need you, does she?\xe2\x80\x9d While he tried to look\nregretful, while he felt that his wife was watching him, he was filled\nwith exultant visions of Tanis.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I\xe2\x80\x99d better go?\xe2\x80\x9d she said sharply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to decide, honey; I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe turned away, sighing, and his forehead was damp.\n\nTill she went, four days later, she was curiously still, he cumbrously\naffectionate. Her train left at noon. As he saw it grow small beyond the\ntrain-shed he longed to hurry to Tanis.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, by golly, I won\xe2\x80\x99t do that!\xe2\x80\x9d he vowed. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t go near her for a\nweek!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut he was at her flat at four.\n\n\nIII\n\nHe who had once controlled or seemed to control his life in a progress\nunimpassioned but diligent and sane was for that fortnight borne on a\ncurrent of desire and very bad whisky and all the complications of new\nacquaintances, those furious new intimates who demand so much more\nattention than old friends. Each morning he gloomily recognized his\nidiocies of the evening before. With his head throbbing, his tongue and\nlips stinging from cigarettes, he incredulously counted the number of\ndrinks he had taken, and groaned, \xe2\x80\x9cI got to quit!\xe2\x80\x9d He had ceased saying,\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _will_ quit!\xe2\x80\x9d for however resolute he might be at dawn, he could not,\nfor a single evening, check his drift.\n\nHe had met Tanis\xe2\x80\x99s friends; he had, with the ardent haste of the\nMidnight People, who drink and dance and rattle and are ever afraid to\nbe silent, been adopted as a member of her group, which they called \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nBunch.\xe2\x80\x9d He first met them after a day when he had worked particularly\nhard and when he hoped to be quiet with Tanis and slowly sip her\nadmiration.\n\nFrom down the hall he could hear shrieks and the grind of a phonograph.\nAs Tanis opened the door he saw fantastic figures dancing in a haze of\ncigarette smoke. The tables and chairs were against the wall.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, isn\xe2\x80\x99t this dandy!\xe2\x80\x9d she gabbled at him. \xe2\x80\x9cCarrie Nork had the\nloveliest idea. She decided it was time for a party, and she \xe2\x80\x99phoned the\nBunch and told \xe2\x80\x99em to gather round.... George, this is Carrie.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarrie\xe2\x80\x9d was, in the less desirable aspects of both, at once matronly\nand spinsterish. She was perhaps forty; her hair was an unconvincing\nash-blond; and if her chest was flat, her hips were ponderous. She\ngreeted Babbitt with a giggling \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome to our little midst! Tanis says\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re a real sport.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe was apparently expected to dance, to be boyish and gay with Carrie,\nand he did his unforgiving best. He towed her about the room, bumping\ninto other couples, into the radiator, into chair-legs cunningly\nambushed. As he danced he surveyed the rest of the Bunch: A thin young\nwoman who looked capable, conceited, and sarcastic. Another woman whom\nhe could never quite remember. Three overdressed and slightly effeminate\nyoung men--soda-fountain clerks, or at least born for that profession. A\nman of his own age, immovable, self-satisfied, resentful of Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s\npresence.\n\nWhen he had finished his dutiful dance Tanis took him aside and begged,\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like to do something for me? I\xe2\x80\x99m all out of booze,\nand the Bunch want to celebrate. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you just skip down to Healey\nHanson\xe2\x80\x99s and get some?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, trying not to sound sullen.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you: I\xe2\x80\x99ll get Minnie Sonntag to drive down with you.\xe2\x80\x9d Tanis\nwas pointing to the thin, sarcastic young woman.\n\nMiss Sonntag greeted him with an astringent \xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99you do, Mr. Babbitt.\nTanis tells me you\xe2\x80\x99re a very prominent man, and I\xe2\x80\x99m honored by being\nallowed to drive with you. Of course I\xe2\x80\x99m not accustomed to associating\nwith society people like you, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to act in such exalted\ncircles!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThus Miss Sonntag talked all the way down to Healey Hanson\xe2\x80\x99s. To her\njibes he wanted to reply \xe2\x80\x9cOh, go to the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d but he never quite\nnerved himself to that reasonable comment. He was resenting the\nexistence of the whole Bunch. He had heard Tanis speak of \xe2\x80\x9cdarling\nCarrie\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMin Sonntag--she\xe2\x80\x99s so clever--you\xe2\x80\x99ll adore her,\xe2\x80\x9d but they\nhad never been real to him. He had pictured Tanis as living in a\nrose-tinted vacuum, waiting for him, free of all the complications of a\nFloral Heights.\n\nWhen they returned he had to endure the patronage of the young\nsoda-clerks. They were as damply friendly as Miss Sonntag was dryly\nhostile. They called him \xe2\x80\x9cOld Georgie\xe2\x80\x9d and shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cCome on now, sport;\nshake a leg\xe2\x80\x9d ... boys in belted coats, pimply boys, as young as Ted and\nas flabby as chorus-men, but powerful to dance and to mind the\nphonograph and smoke cigarettes and patronize Tanis. He tried to be one\nof them; he cried \xe2\x80\x9cGood work, Pete!\xe2\x80\x9d but his voice creaked.\n\nTanis apparently enjoyed the companionship of the dancing darlings; she\nbridled to their bland flirtation and casually kissed them at the end of\neach dance. Babbitt hated her, for the moment. He saw her as\nmiddle-aged. He studied the wrinkles in the softness of her throat, the\nslack flesh beneath her chin. The taut muscles of her youth were loose\nand drooping. Between dances she sat in the largest chair, waving her\ncigarette, summoning her callow admirers to come and talk to her. (\xe2\x80\x9cShe\nthinks she\xe2\x80\x99s a blooming queen!\xe2\x80\x9d growled Babbitt.) She chanted to Miss\nSonntag, \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t my little studio sweet?\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cStudio, rats! It\xe2\x80\x99s a plain\nold-maid-and-chow-dog flat! Oh, God, I wish I was home! I wonder if I\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t make a getaway now?\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\nHis vision grew blurred, however, as he applied himself to Healey\nHanson\xe2\x80\x99s raw but vigorous whisky. He blended with the Bunch. He began to\nrejoice that Carrie Nork and Pete, the most nearly intelligent of the\nnimble youths, seemed to like him; and it was enormously important to\nwin over the surly older man, who proved to be a railway clerk named\nFulton Bemis.\n\nThe conversation of the Bunch was exclamatory, high-colored, full of\nreferences to people whom Babbitt did not know. Apparently they thought\nvery comfortably of themselves. They were the Bunch, wise and beautiful\nand amusing; they were Bohemians and urbanites, accustomed to all the\nluxuries of Zenith: dance-halls, movie-theaters, and roadhouses; and in\na cynical superiority to people who were \xe2\x80\x9cslow\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ctightwad\xe2\x80\x9d they\ncackled:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Pete, did I tell you what that dub of a cashier said when I came in\nlate yesterday? Oh, it was per-fect-ly priceless!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but wasn\xe2\x80\x99t T. D. stewed! Say, he was simply ossified! What did\nGladys say to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink of the nerve of Bob Bickerstaff trying to get us to come to his\nhouse! Say, the nerve of him! Can you beat it for nerve? Some nerve I\ncall it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you notice how Dotty was dancing? Gee, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she the limit!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt was to be heard sonorously agreeing with the once-hated Miss\nMinnie Sonntag that persons who let a night go by without dancing to\njazz music were crabs, pikers, and poor fish; and he roared \xe2\x80\x9cYou bet!\xe2\x80\x9d\nwhen Mrs. Carrie Nork gurgled, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you love to sit on the floor? It\xe2\x80\x99s\nso Bohemian!\xe2\x80\x9d He began to think extremely well of the Bunch. When he\nmentioned his friends Sir Gerald Doak, Lord Wycombe, William Washington\nEathorne, and Chum Frink, he was proud of their condescending interest.\nHe got so thoroughly into the jocund spirit that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t much mind\nseeing Tanis drooping against the shoulder of the youngest and milkiest\nof the young men, and he himself desired to hold Carrie Nork\xe2\x80\x99s pulpy\nhand, and dropped it only because Tanis looked angry.\n\nWhen he went home, at two, he was fully a member of the Bunch, and all\nthe week thereafter he was bound by the exceedingly straitened\nconventions, the exceedingly wearing demands, of their life of pleasure\nand freedom. He had to go to their parties; he was involved in the\nagitation when everybody telephoned to everybody else that she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\nmeant what she\xe2\x80\x99d said when she\xe2\x80\x99d said that, and anyway, why was Pete\ngoing around saying she\xe2\x80\x99d said it?\n\nNever was a Family more insistent on learning one another\xe2\x80\x99s movements\nthan were the Bunch. All of them volubly knew, or indignantly desired to\nknow, where all the others had been every minute of the week. Babbitt\nfound himself explaining to Carrie or Fulton Bemis just what he had been\ndoing that he should not have joined them till ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and\napologizing for having gone to dinner with a business acquaintance.\n\nEvery member of the Bunch was expected to telephone to every other\nmember at least once a week. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy haven\xe2\x80\x99t you called me up?\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt was\nasked accusingly, not only by Tanis and Carrie but presently by new\nancient friends, Jennie and Capitolina and Toots.\n\nIf for a moment he had seen Tanis as withering and sentimental, he lost\nthat impression at Carrie Nork\xe2\x80\x99s dance. Mrs. Nork had a large house and\na small husband. To her party came all of the Bunch, perhaps thirty-five\nof them when they were completely mobilized. Babbitt, under the name of\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld Georgie,\xe2\x80\x9d was now a pioneer of the Bunch, since each month it\nchanged half its membership and he who could recall the prehistoric days\nof a fortnight ago, before Mrs. Absolom, the food-demonstrator, had gone\nto Indianapolis, and Mac had \xe2\x80\x9cgot sore at\xe2\x80\x9d Minnie, was a venerable\nleader and able to condescend to new Petes and Minnies and Gladyses.\n\nAt Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s, Tanis did not have to work at being hostess. She was\ndignified and sure, a clear fine figure in the black chiffon frock he\nhad always loved; and in the wider spaces of that ugly house Babbitt was\nable to sit quietly with her. He repented of his first revulsion, mooned\nat her feet, and happily drove her home. Next day he bought a violent\nyellow tie, to make himself young for her. He knew, a little sadly, that\nhe could not make himself beautiful; he beheld himself as heavy, hinting\nof fatness, but he danced, he dressed, he chattered, to be as young as\nshe was... as young as she seemed to be.\n\n\nIV\n\nAs all converts, whether to a religion, love, or gardening, find as by\nmagic that though hitherto these hobbies have not seemed to exist, now\nthe whole world is filled with their fury, so, once he was converted to\ndissipation, Babbitt discovered agreeable opportunities for it\neverywhere.\n\nHe had a new view of his sporting neighbor, Sam Doppelbrau. The\nDoppelbraus were respectable people, industrious people, prosperous\npeople, whose ideal of happiness was an eternal cabaret. Their life was\ndominated by suburban bacchanalia of alcohol, nicotine, gasoline, and\nkisses. They and their set worked capably all the week, and all week\nlooked forward to Saturday night, when they would, as they expressed it,\n\xe2\x80\x9cthrow a party;\xe2\x80\x9d and the thrown party grew noisier and noisier up to\nSunday dawn, and usually included an extremely rapid motor expedition to\nnowhere in particular.\n\nOne evening when Tanis was at the theater, Babbitt found himself being\nlively with the Doppelbraus, pledging friendship with men whom he had\nfor years privily denounced to Mrs. Babbitt as a \xe2\x80\x9crotten bunch of\ntin-horns that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go out with, not if they were the last people\non earth.\xe2\x80\x9d That evening he had sulkily come home and poked about in\nfront of the house, chipping off the walk the ice-clots, like fossil\nfootprints, made by the steps of passers-by during the recent snow.\nHoward Littlefield came up snuffling.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill a widower, George?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYump. Cold again to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you hear from the wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s feeling fine, but her sister is still pretty sick.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, better come in and have dinner with us to-night, George.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh--oh, thanks. Have to go out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSuddenly he could not endure Littlefield\xe2\x80\x99s recitals of the more\ninteresting statistics about totally uninteresting problems. He scraped\nat the walk and grunted.\n\nSam Doppelbrau appeared.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvenin\xe2\x80\x99, Babbitt. Working hard?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYuh, lil exercise.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCold enough for you to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, just about.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill a widower?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUh-huh.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Babbitt, while she\xe2\x80\x99s away-- I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t care much for\nbooze-fights, but the Missus and I\xe2\x80\x99d be awfully glad if you could come\nin some night. Think you could stand a good cocktail for once?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand it? Young fella, I bet old Uncle George can mix the best cocktail\nin these United States!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurray! That\xe2\x80\x99s the way to talk! Look here: There\xe2\x80\x99s some folks coming to\nthe house to-night, Louetta Swanson and some other live ones, and I\xe2\x80\x99m\ngoing to open up a bottle of pre-war gin, and maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll dance a while.\nWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you drop in and jazz it up a little, just for a change?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell-- What time they coming?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe was at Sam Doppelbrau\xe2\x80\x99s at nine. It was the third time he had entered\nthe house. By ten he was calling Mr. Doppelbrau \xe2\x80\x9cSam, old hoss.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt eleven they all drove out to the Old Farm Inn. Babbitt sat in the\nback of Doppelbrau\xe2\x80\x99s car with Louetta Swanson. Once he had timorously\ntried to make love to her. Now he did not try; he merely made love; and\nLouetta dropped her head on his shoulder, told him what a nagger Eddie\nwas, and accepted Babbitt as a decent and well-trained libertine.\n\nWith the assistance of Tanis\xe2\x80\x99s Bunch, the Doppelbraus, and other\ncompanions in forgetfulness, there was not an evening for two weeks when\nhe did not return home late and shaky. With his other faculties blurred\nhe yet had the motorist\xe2\x80\x99s gift of being able to drive when he could\nscarce walk; of slowing down at corners and allowing for approaching\ncars. He came wambling into the house. If Verona and Kenneth Escott were\nabout, he got past them with a hasty greeting, horribly aware of their\nlevel young glances, and hid himself up-stairs. He found when he came\ninto the warm house that he was hazier than he had believed. His head\nwhirled. He dared not lie down. He tried to soak out the alcohol in a\nhot bath. For the moment his head was clearer but when he moved about\nthe bathroom his calculations of distance were wrong, so that he dragged\ndown the towels, and knocked over the soap-dish with a clatter which, he\nfeared, would betray him to the children. Chilly in his dressing-gown he\ntried to read the evening paper. He could follow every word; he seemed\nto take in the sense of things; but a minute afterward he could not have\ntold what he had been reading. When he went to bed his brain flew in\ncircles, and he hastily sat up, struggling for self-control. At last he\nwas able to lie still, feeling only a little sick and dizzy--and\nenormously ashamed. To hide his \xe2\x80\x9ccondition\xe2\x80\x9d from his own children! To\nhave danced and shouted with people whom he despised! To have said\nfoolish things, sung idiotic songs, tried to kiss silly girls!\nIncredulously he remembered that he had by his roaring familiarity with\nthem laid himself open to the patronizing of youths whom he would have\nkicked out of his office; that by dancing too ardently he had exposed\nhimself to rebukes from the rattiest of withering women. As it came\nrelentlessly back to him he snarled, \xe2\x80\x9cI hate myself! God how I hate\nmyself!\xe2\x80\x9d But, he raged, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m through! No more! Had enough, plenty!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe was even surer about it the morning after, when he was trying to be\ngrave and paternal with his daughters at breakfast. At noontime he was\nless sure. He did not deny that he had been a fool; he saw it almost as\nclearly as at midnight; but anything, he struggled, was better than\ngoing back to a life of barren heartiness. At four he wanted a drink. He\nkept a whisky flask in his desk now, and after two minutes of battle he\nhad his drink. Three drinks later he began to see the Bunch as tender\nand amusing friends, and by six he was with them... and the tale was to\nbe told all over.\n\nEach morning his head ached a little less. A bad head for drinks had\nbeen his safeguard, but the safeguard was crumbling. Presently he could\nbe drunk at dawn, yet not feel particularly wretched in his\nconscience--or in his stomach--when he awoke at eight. No regret, no\ndesire to escape the toil of keeping up with the arduous merriment of\nthe Bunch, was so great as his feeling of social inferiority when he\nfailed to keep up. To be the \xe2\x80\x9clivest\xe2\x80\x9d of them was as much his ambition\nnow as it had been to excel at making money, at playing golf, at\nmotor-driving, at oratory, at climbing to the McKelvey set. But\noccasionally he failed.\n\nHe found that Pete and the other young men considered the Bunch too\nausterely polite and the Carrie who merely kissed behind doors too\nembarrassingly monogamic. As Babbitt sneaked from Floral Heights down to\nthe Bunch, so the young gallants sneaked from the proprieties of the\nBunch off to \xe2\x80\x9ctimes\xe2\x80\x9d with bouncing young women whom they picked up in\ndepartment stores and at hotel coatrooms. Once Babbitt tried to\naccompany them. There was a motor car, a bottle of whisky, and for him a\ngrubby shrieking cash-girl from Parcher and Stein\xe2\x80\x99s. He sat beside her\nand worried. He was apparently expected to \xe2\x80\x9cjolly her along,\xe2\x80\x9d but when\nshe sang out, \xe2\x80\x9cHey, leggo, quit crushing me cootie-garage,\xe2\x80\x9d he did not\nquite know how to go on. They sat in the back room of a saloon, and\nBabbitt had a headache, was confused by their new slang, looked at them\nbenevolently, wanted to go home, and had a drink--a good many drinks.\n\nTwo evenings after, Fulton Bemis, the surly older man of the Bunch, took\nBabbitt aside and grunted, \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, it\xe2\x80\x99s none of my business, and God\nknows I always lap up my share of the hootch, but don\xe2\x80\x99t you think you\nbetter watch yourself? You\xe2\x80\x99re one of these enthusiastic chumps that\nalways overdo things. D\xe2\x80\x99you realize you\xe2\x80\x99re throwing in the booze as fast\nas you can, and you eat one cigarette right after another? Better cut it\nout for a while.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt tearfully said that good old Fult was a prince, and yes, he\ncertainly would cut it out, and thereafter he lighted a cigarette and\ntook a drink and had a terrific quarrel with Tanis when she caught him\nbeing affectionate with Carrie Nork.\n\nNext morning he hated himself that he should have sunk into a position\nwhere a fifteenth-rater like Fulton Bemis could rebuke him. He perceived\nthat, since he was making love to every woman possible, Tanis was no\nlonger his one pure star, and he wondered whether she had ever been\nanything more to him than A Woman. And if Bemis had spoken to him, were\nother people talking about him? He suspiciously watched the men at the\nAthletic Club that noon. It seemed to him that they were uneasy. They\nhad been talking about him then? He was angry. He became belligerent. He\nnot only defended Seneca Doane but even made fun of the Y. M. C. A.\nVergil Gunch was rather brief in his answers.\n\nAfterward Babbitt was not angry. He was afraid. He did not go to the\nnext lunch of the Boosters\xe2\x80\x99 Club but hid in a cheap restaurant, and,\nwhile he munched a ham-and-egg sandwich and sipped coffee from a cup on\nthe arm of his chair, he worried.\n\nFour days later, when the Bunch were having one of their best parties,\nBabbitt drove them to the skating-rink which had been laid out on the\nChaloosa River. After a thaw the streets had frozen in smooth ice. Down\nthose wide endless streets the wind rattled between the rows of wooden\nhouses, and the whole Bellevue district seemed a frontier town. Even\nwith skid chains on all four wheels, Babbitt was afraid of sliding, and\nwhen he came to the long slide of a hill he crawled down, both brakes\non. Slewing round a corner came a less cautious car. It skidded, it\nalmost raked them with its rear fenders. In relief at their escape the\nBunch--Tanis, Minnie Sonntag, Pete, Fulton Bemis--shouted \xe2\x80\x9cOh, baby,\xe2\x80\x9d\nand waved their hands to the agitated other driver. Then Babbitt saw\nProfessor Pumphrey laboriously crawling up hill, afoot, staring owlishly\nat the revelers. He was sure that Pumphrey recognized him and saw Tanis\nkiss him as she crowed, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re such a good driver!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt lunch next day he probed Pumphrey with \xe2\x80\x9cOut last night with my\nbrother and some friends of his. Gosh, what driving! Slippery\xe2\x80\x99s glass.\nThought I saw you hiking up the Bellevue Avenue Hill.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t-- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pumphrey, hastily, rather\nguiltily.\n\nPerhaps two days afterward Babbitt took Tanis to lunch at the Hotel\nThornleigh. She who had seemed well content to wait for him at her flat\nhad begun to hint with melancholy smiles that he must think but little\nof her if he never introduced her to his friends, if he was unwilling to\nbe seen with her except at the movies. He thought of taking her to the\n\xe2\x80\x9cladies\xe2\x80\x99 annex\xe2\x80\x9d of the Athletic Club, but that was too dangerous. He\nwould have to introduce her and, oh, people might misunderstand and-- He\ncompromised on the Thornleigh.\n\nShe was unusually smart, all in black: small black tricorne hat, short\nblack caracul coat, loose and swinging, and austere high-necked black\nvelvet frock at a time when most street costumes were like evening\ngowns. Perhaps she was too smart. Every one in the gold and oak\nrestaurant of the Thornleigh was staring at her as Babbitt followed her\nto a table. He uneasily hoped that the head-waiter would give them a\ndiscreet place behind a pillar, but they were stationed on the center\naisle. Tanis seemed not to notice her admirers; she smiled at Babbitt\nwith a lavish \xe2\x80\x9cOh, isn\xe2\x80\x99t this nice! What a peppy-looking orchestra!\xe2\x80\x9d\nBabbitt had difficulty in being lavish in return, for two tables away he\nsaw Vergil Gunch. All through the meal Gunch watched them, while Babbitt\nwatched himself being watched and lugubriously tried to keep from\nspoiling Tanis\xe2\x80\x99s gaiety. \xe2\x80\x9cI felt like a spree to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d she rippled. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nlove the Thornleigh, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? It\xe2\x80\x99s so live and yet so--so refined.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe made talk about the Thornleigh, the service, the food, the people he\nrecognized in the restaurant, all but Vergil Gunch. There did not seem\nto be anything else to talk of. He smiled conscientiously at her\nfluttering jests; he agreed with her that Minnie Sonntag was \xe2\x80\x9cso hard to\nget along with,\xe2\x80\x9d and young Pete \xe2\x80\x9csuch a silly lazy kid, really just no\ngood at all.\xe2\x80\x9d But he himself had nothing to say. He considered telling\nher his worries about Gunch, but--\xe2\x80\x9coh, gosh, it was too much work to go\ninto the whole thing and explain about Verg and everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe was relieved when he put Tanis on a trolley; he was cheerful in the\nfamiliar simplicities of his office.\n\nAt four o\xe2\x80\x99clock Vergil Gunch called on him.\n\nBabbitt was agitated, but Gunch began in a friendly way:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s the boy? Say, some of us are getting up a scheme we\xe2\x80\x99d kind of\nlike to have you come in on.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine, Verg. Shoot.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know during the war we had the Undesirable Element, the Reds and\nwalking delegates and just the plain common grouches, dead to rights,\nand so did we for quite a while after the war, but folks forget about\nthe danger and that gives these cranks a chance to begin working\nunderground again, especially a lot of these parlor socialists. Well,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s up to the folks that do a little sound thinking to make a conscious\neffort to keep bucking these fellows. Some guy back East has organized a\nsociety called the Good Citizens\xe2\x80\x99 League for just that purpose. Of\ncourse the Chamber of Commerce and the American Legion and so on do a\nfine work in keeping the decent people in the saddle, but they\xe2\x80\x99re\ndevoted to so many other causes that they can\xe2\x80\x99t attend to this one\nproblem properly. But the Good Citizens\xe2\x80\x99 League, the G. C. L., they\nstick right to it. Oh, the G. C. L. has to have some other ostensible\npurposes--frinstance here in Zenith I think it ought to support the\npark-extension project and the City Planning Committee--and then, too,\nit should have a social aspect, being made up of the best people--have\ndances and so on, especially as one of the best ways it can put the\nkibosh on cranks is to apply this social boycott business to folks big\nenough so you can\xe2\x80\x99t reach \xe2\x80\x99em otherwise. Then if that don\xe2\x80\x99t work, the G.\nC. L. can finally send a little delegation around to inform folks that\nget too flip that they got to conform to decent standards and quit\nshooting off their mouths so free. Don\xe2\x80\x99t it sound like the organization\ncould do a great work? We\xe2\x80\x99ve already got some of the strongest men in\ntown, and of course we want you in. How about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt was uncomfortable. He felt a compulsion back to all the\nstandards he had so vaguely yet so desperately been fleeing. He fumbled:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you\xe2\x80\x99d especially light on fellows like Seneca Doane and try\nto make \xe2\x80\x99em--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet your sweet life we would! Look here, old Georgie: I\xe2\x80\x99ve never\nfor one moment believed you meant it when you\xe2\x80\x99ve defended Doane, and the\nstrikers and so on, at the Club. I knew you were simply kidding those\npoor galoots like Sid Finkelstein.... At least I certainly hope you were\nkidding!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well--sure-- Course you might say--\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt was conscious of how\nfeeble he sounded, conscious of Gunch\xe2\x80\x99s mature and relentless eye.\n\xe2\x80\x9cGosh, you know where I stand! I\xe2\x80\x99m no labor agitator! I\xe2\x80\x99m a business\nman, first, last, and all the time! But--but honestly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\nDoane means so badly, and you got to remember he\xe2\x80\x99s an old friend of\nmine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge, when it comes right down to a struggle between decency and the\nsecurity of our homes on the one hand, and red ruin and those lazy dogs\nplotting for free beer on the other, you got to give up even old\nfriendships. \xe2\x80\x98He that is not with me is against me.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe-es, I suppose--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow about it? Going to join us in the Good Citizens\xe2\x80\x99 League?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have to think it over, Verg.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, just as you say.\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt was relieved to be let off so\neasily, but Gunch went on: \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s come over you;\nnone of us do; and we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a lot about you. For a while we figured\nout you\xe2\x80\x99d been upset by what happened to poor Riesling, and we forgave\nyou for any fool things you said, but that\xe2\x80\x99s old stuff now, George, and\nwe can\xe2\x80\x99t make out what\xe2\x80\x99s got into you. Personally, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always defended\nyou, but I must say it\xe2\x80\x99s getting too much for me. All the boys at the\nAthletic Club and the Boosters\xe2\x80\x99 are sore, the way you go on deliberately\ntouting Doane and his bunch of hell-hounds, and talking about being\nliberal--which means being wishy-washy--and even saying this preacher\nguy Ingram isn\xe2\x80\x99t a professional free-love artist. And then the way you\nbeen carrying on personally! Joe Pumphrey says he saw you out the other\nnight with a gang of totties, all stewed to the gills, and here to-day\ncoming right into the Thornleigh with a--well, she may be all right and\na perfect lady, but she certainly did look like a pretty gay skirt for a\nfellow with his wife out of town to be taking to lunch. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t look\nwell. What the devil has come over you, George?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrikes me there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of fellows that know more about my personal\nbusiness than I do myself!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow don\xe2\x80\x99t go getting sore at me because I come out flatfooted like a\nfriend and say what I think instead of tattling behind your back, the\nway a whole lot of \xe2\x80\x99em do. I tell you, George, you got a position in the\ncommunity, and the community expects you to live up to it. And-- Better\nthink over joining the Good Citizens\xe2\x80\x99 League. See you about it later.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe was gone.\n\nThat evening Babbitt dined alone. He saw all the Clan of Good Fellows\npeering through the restaurant window, spying on him. Fear sat beside\nhim, and he told himself that to-night he would not go to Tanis\xe2\x80\x99s flat;\nand he did not go... till late.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n\nI\n\nThe summer before, Mrs. Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s letters had crackled with desire to\nreturn to Zenith. Now they said nothing of returning, but a wistful \xe2\x80\x9cI\nsuppose everything is going on all right without me\xe2\x80\x9d among her dry\nchronicles of weather and sicknesses hinted to Babbitt that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\nbeen very urgent about her coming. He worried it:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she were here, and I went on raising cain like I been doing, she\xe2\x80\x99d\nhave a fit. I got to get hold of myself. I got to learn to play around\nand yet not make a fool of myself. I can do it, too, if folks like Verg\nGunch\xe2\x80\x99ll let me alone, and Myra\xe2\x80\x99ll stay away. But--poor kid, she sounds\nlonely. Lord, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hurt her!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nImpulsively he wrote that they missed her, and her next letter said\nhappily that she was coming home.\n\nHe persuaded himself that he was eager to see her. He bought roses for\nthe house, he ordered squab for dinner, he had the car cleaned and\npolished. All the way home from the station with her he was adequate in\nhis accounts of Ted\xe2\x80\x99s success in basket-ball at the university, but\nbefore they reached Floral Heights there was nothing more to say, and\nalready he felt the force of her stolidity, wondered whether he could\nremain a good husband and still sneak out of the house this evening for\nhalf an hour with the Bunch. When he had housed the car he blundered\nupstairs, into the familiar talcum-scented warmth of her presence,\nblaring, \xe2\x80\x9cHelp you unpack your bag?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSlowly she turned, holding up a small box, and slowly she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\nbrought you a present, just a new cigar-case. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you\xe2\x80\x99d care\nto have it--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe was the lonely girl, the brown appealing Myra Thompson, whom he had\nmarried, and he almost wept for pity as he kissed her and besought, \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\nhoney, honey, _care_ to have it? Of course I do! I\xe2\x80\x99m awful proud you\nbrought it to me. And I needed a new case badly.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe wondered how he would get rid of the case he had bought the week\nbefore.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you really are glad to see me back?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you poor kiddy, what you been worrying about?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to miss me very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBy the time he had finished his stint of lying they were firmly bound\nagain. By ten that evening it seemed improbable that she had ever been\naway. There was but one difference: the problem of remaining a\nrespectable husband, a Floral Heights husband, yet seeing Tanis and the\nBunch with frequency. He had promised to telephone to Tanis that\nevening, and now it was melodramatically impossible. He prowled about\nthe telephone, impulsively thrusting out a hand to lift the receiver,\nbut never quite daring to risk it. Nor could he find a reason for\nslipping down to the drug store on Smith Street, with its\ntelephone-booth. He was laden with responsibility till he threw it off\nwith the speculation: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy the deuce should I fret so about not being\nable to \xe2\x80\x99phone Tanis? She can get along without me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t owe her\nanything. She\xe2\x80\x99s a fine girl, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve given her just as much as she has\nme.... Oh, damn these women and the way they get you all tied up in\ncomplications!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nII\n\nFor a week he was attentive to his wife, took her to the theater, to\ndinner at the Littlefields\xe2\x80\x99; then the old weary dodging and shifting\nbegan, and at least two evenings a week he spent with the Bunch. He\nstill made pretense of going to the Elks and to committee-meetings but\nless and less did he trouble to have his excuses interesting, less and\nless did she affect to believe them. He was certain that she knew he was\nassociating with what Floral Heights called \xe2\x80\x9ca sporty crowd,\xe2\x80\x9d yet\nneither of them acknowledged it. In matrimonial geography the distance\nbetween the first mute recognition of a break and the admission thereof\nis as great as the distance between the first na\xc3\xafve faith and the first\ndoubting.\n\nAs he began to drift away he also began to see her as a human being, to\nlike and dislike her instead of accepting her as a comparatively movable\npart of the furniture, and he compassionated that husband-and-wife\nrelation which, in twenty-five years of married life, had become a\nseparate and real entity. He recalled their high lights: the summer\nvacation in Virginia meadows under the blue wall of the mountains; their\nmotor tour through Ohio, and the exploration of Cleveland, Cincinnati,\nand Columbus; the birth of Verona; their building of this new house,\nplanned to comfort them through a happy old age--chokingly they had said\nthat it might be the last home either of them would ever have. Yet his\nmost softening remembrance of these dear moments did not keep him from\nbarking at dinner, \xe2\x80\x9cYep, going out f\xe2\x80\x99 few hours. Don\xe2\x80\x99t sit up for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe did not dare now to come home drunk, and though he rejoiced in his\nreturn to high morality and spoke with gravity to Pete and Fulton Bemis\nabout their drinking, he prickled at Myra\xe2\x80\x99s unexpressed criticisms and\nsulkily meditated that a \xe2\x80\x9cfellow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever learn to handle himself\nif he was always bossed by a lot of women.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe no longer wondered if Tanis wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a bit worn and sentimental. In\ncontrast to the complacent Myra he saw her as swift and air-borne and\nradiant, a fire-spirit tenderly stooping to the hearth, and however\npitifully he brooded on his wife, he longed to be with Tanis.\n\nThen Mrs. Babbitt tore the decent cloak from her unhappiness and the\nastounded male discovered that she was having a small determined\nrebellion of her own.\n\n\nIII\n\nThey were beside the fireless fire-place, in the evening.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorgie,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou haven\xe2\x80\x99t given me the list of your household\nexpenses while I was away.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I-- Haven\xe2\x80\x99t made it out yet.\xe2\x80\x9d Very affably: \xe2\x80\x9cGosh, we must try to\nkeep down expenses this year.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where all the money goes to. I try to\neconomize, but it just seems to evaporate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to spend so much on cigars. Don\xe2\x80\x99t know but what\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll cut down my smoking, maybe cut it out entirely. I was thinking of a\ngood way to do it, the other day: start on these cubeb cigarettes, and\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d kind of disgust me with smoking.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I do wish you would! It isn\xe2\x80\x99t that I care, but honestly, George, it\nis so bad for you to smoke so much. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think you could reduce the\namount? And George-- I notice now, when you come home from these lodges\nand all, that sometimes you smell of whisky. Dearie, you know I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nworry so much about the moral side of it, but you have a weak stomach\nand you can\xe2\x80\x99t stand all this drinking.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeak stomach, hell! I guess I can carry my booze about as well as most\nfolks!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I do think you ought to be careful. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, dear, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nwant you to get sick.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSick, rats! I\xe2\x80\x99m not a baby! I guess I ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to get sick just\nbecause maybe once a week I shoot a highball! That\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble with\nwomen. They always exaggerate so.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you ought to talk that way when I\xe2\x80\x99m just speaking\nfor your own good.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, but gosh all fishhooks, that\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble with women! They\xe2\x80\x99re\nalways criticizing and commenting and bringing things up, and then they\nsay it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98for your own good\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, George, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a nice way to talk, to answer me so short.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to answer short, but gosh, talking as if I was a\nkindergarten brat, not able to tote one highball without calling for the\nSt. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s ambulance! A fine idea you must have of me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t that; it\xe2\x80\x99s just-- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see you get sick and-- My,\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it was so late! Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to give me those household\naccounts for the time while I was away.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, thunder, what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of taking the trouble to make \xe2\x80\x99em out now?\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s just skip \xe2\x80\x99em for that period.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, George Babbitt, in all the years we\xe2\x80\x99ve been married we\xe2\x80\x99ve never\nfailed to keep a complete account of every penny we\xe2\x80\x99ve spent!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in the world do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything, only-- Sometimes I get so darn sick and tired\nof all this routine and the accounting at the office and expenses at\nhome and fussing and stewing and fretting and wearing myself out\nworrying over a lot of junk that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really mean a doggone thing,\nand being so careful and-- Good Lord, what do you think I\xe2\x80\x99m made for? I\ncould have been a darn good orator, and here I fuss and fret and\nworry--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you suppose I ever get tired of fussing? I get so bored with\nordering three meals a day, three hundred and sixty-five days a year,\nand ruining my eyes over that horrid sewing-machine, and looking after\nyour clothes and Rone\xe2\x80\x99s and Ted\xe2\x80\x99s and Tinka\xe2\x80\x99s and everybody\xe2\x80\x99s, and the\nlaundry, and darning socks, and going down to the Piggly Wiggly to\nmarket, and bringing my basket home to save money on the cash-and-carry\nand--_everything!_\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, gosh,\xe2\x80\x9d with a certain astonishment, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose maybe you do! But\ntalk about-- Here I have to be in the office every single day, while you\ncan go out all afternoon and see folks and visit with the neighbors and\ndo any blinkin\xe2\x80\x99 thing you want to!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and a fine lot of good that does me! Just talking over the same\nold things with the same old crowd, while you have all sorts of\ninteresting people coming in to see you at the office.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cInteresting! Cranky old dames that want to know why I haven\xe2\x80\x99t rented\ntheir dear precious homes for about seven times their value, and bunch\nof old crabs panning the everlasting daylights out of me because they\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t receive every cent of their rentals by three G.M. on the second of\nthe month! Sure! Interesting! Just as interesting as the small pox!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, George, I will not have you shouting at me that way!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it gets my goat the way women figure out that a man doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do a\ndarn thing but sit on his chair and have lovey-dovey conferences with a\nlot of classy dames and give \xe2\x80\x99em the glad eye!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess you manage to give them a glad enough eye when they do come\nin.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? Mean I\xe2\x80\x99m chasing flappers?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should hope not--at your age!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you look here! You may not believe it-- Of course all you see is fat\nlittle Georgie Babbitt. Sure! Handy man around the house! Fixes the\nfurnace when the furnace-man doesn\xe2\x80\x99t show up, and pays the bills, but\ndull, awful dull! Well, you may not believe it, but there\xe2\x80\x99s some women\nthat think old George Babbitt isn\xe2\x80\x99t such a bad scout! They think he\xe2\x80\x99s\nnot so bad-looking, not so bad that it hurts anyway, and he\xe2\x80\x99s got a\npretty good line of guff, and some even think he shakes a darn wicked\nWalkover at dancing!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t much doubt that when I\xe2\x80\x99m away you\nmanage to find people who properly appreciate you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I just mean--\xe2\x80\x9d he protested, with a sound of denial. Then he was\nangered into semi-honesty. \xe2\x80\x9cYou bet I do! I find plenty of folks, and\ndoggone nice ones, that don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m a weak-stomached baby!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I was saying! You can run around with anybody you\nplease, but I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to sit here and wait for you. You have the\nchance to get all sorts of culture and everything, and I just stay\nhome--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, gosh almighty, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to prevent your reading books and\ngoing to lectures and all that junk, is there?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge, I _told_ you, I won\xe2\x80\x99t have you shouting at me like that! I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s come over you. You never used to speak to me in this\ncranky way.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to sound cranky, but gosh, it certainly makes me sore to\nget the blame because you don\xe2\x80\x99t keep up with things.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to! Will you help me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure. Anything I can do to help you in the culture-grabbing line--yours\nto oblige, G. F. Babbitt.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well then, I want you to go to Mrs. Mudge\xe2\x80\x99s New Thought meeting\nwith me, next Sunday afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Who\xe2\x80\x99s which?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Opal Emerson Mudge. The field-lecturer for the American New\nThought League. She\xe2\x80\x99s going to speak on \xe2\x80\x98Cultivating the Sun Spirit\xe2\x80\x99\nbefore the League of the Higher Illumination, at the Thornleigh.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, punk! New Thought! Hashed thought with a poached egg! \xe2\x80\x98Cultivating\nthe--\xe2\x80\x99 It sounds like \xe2\x80\x98Why is a mouse when it spins?\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s a fine\nspiel for a good Presbyterian to be going to, when you can hear Doc\nDrew!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReverend Drew is a scholar and a pulpit orator and all that, but he\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t got the Inner Ferment, as Mrs. Mudge calls it; he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t any\ninspiration for the New Era. Women need inspiration now. So I want you\nto come, as you promised.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nIV\n\nThe Zenith branch of the League of the Higher Illumination met in the\nsmaller ballroom at the Hotel Thornleigh, a refined apartment with pale\ngreen walls and plaster wreaths of roses, refined parquet flooring, and\nultra-refined frail gilt chairs. Here were gathered sixty-five women and\nten men. Most of the men slouched in their chairs and wriggled, while\ntheir wives sat rigidly at attention, but two of them--red-necked, meaty\nmen--were as respectably devout as their wives. They were newly rich\ncontractors who, having bought houses, motors, hand-painted pictures,\nand gentlemanliness, were now buying a refined ready-made philosophy. It\nhad been a toss-up with them whether to buy New Thought, Christian\nScience, or a good standard high-church model of Episcopalianism.\n\nIn the flesh, Mrs. Opal Emerson Mudge fell somewhat short of a prophetic\naspect. She was pony-built and plump, with the face of a haughty\nPekingese, a button of a nose, and arms so short that, despite her most\nindignant endeavors, she could not clasp her hands in front of her as\nshe sat on the platform waiting. Her frock of taffeta and green velvet,\nwith three strings of glass beads, and large folding eye-glasses\ndangling from a black ribbon, was a triumph of refinement.\n\nMrs. Mudge was introduced by the president of the League of the Higher\nIllumination, an oldish young woman with a yearning voice, white spats,\nand a mustache. She said that Mrs. Mudge would now make it plain to the\nsimplest intellect how the Sun Spirit could be cultivated, and they who\nhad been thinking about cultivating one would do well to treasure Mrs.\nMudge\xe2\x80\x99s words, because even Zenith (and everybody knew that Zenith stood\nin the van of spiritual and New Thought progress) didn\xe2\x80\x99t often have the\nopportunity to sit at the feet of such an inspiring Optimist and\nMetaphysical Seer as Mrs. Opal Emerson Mudge, who had lived the Life of\nWider Usefulness through Concentration, and in the Silence found those\nSecrets of Mental Control and the Inner Key which were immediately going\nto transform and bring Peace, Power, and Prosperity to the unhappy\nnations; and so, friends, would they for this precious gem-studded hour\nforget the Illusions of the Seeming Real, and in the actualization of\nthe deep-lying Veritas pass, along with Mrs. Opal Emerson Mudge, to the\nRealm Beautiful.\n\nIf Mrs. Mudge was rather pudgier than one would like one\xe2\x80\x99s swamis,\nyogis, seers, and initiates, yet her voice had the real professional\nnote. It was refined and optimistic; it was overpoweringly calm; it\nflowed on relentlessly, without one comma, till Babbitt was hypnotized.\nHer favorite word was \xe2\x80\x9calways,\xe2\x80\x9d which she pronounced olllllle-ways. Her\nprincipal gesture was a pontifical but thoroughly ladylike blessing with\ntwo stubby fingers.\n\nShe explained about this matter of Spiritual Saturation:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are those--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOf \xe2\x80\x9cthose\xe2\x80\x9d she made a linked sweetness long drawn out; a far-off\ndelicate call in a twilight minor. It chastely rebuked the restless\nhusbands, yet brought them a message of healing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are those who have seen the rim and outer seeming of the Logos\nthere are those who have glimpsed and in enthusiasm possessed themselves\nof some segment and portion of the Logos there are those who thus\nflicked but not penetrated and radioactivated by the Dynamis go always\nto and fro assertative that they possess and are possessed of the Logos\nand the Metaphysikos but this word I bring you this concept I enlarge\nthat those that are not utter are not even inceptive and that holiness\nis in its definitive essence always always always whole-iness and--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt proved that the Essence of the Sun Spirit was Truth, but its Aura and\nEffluxion were Cheerfulness:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFace always the day with the dawn-laugh with the enthusiasm of the\ninitiate who perceives that all works together in the revolutions of the\nWheel and who answers the strictures of the Soured Souls of the\nDestructionists with a Glad Affirmation--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt went on for about an hour and seven minutes.\n\nAt the end Mrs. Mudge spoke with more vigor and punctuation:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow let me suggest to all of you the advantages of the Theosophical and\nPantheistic Oriental Reading Circle, which I represent. Our object is to\nunite all the manifestations of the New Era into one cohesive whole--New\nThought, Christian Science, Theosophy, Vedanta, Bahaism, and the other\nsparks from the one New Light. The subscription is but ten dollars a\nyear, and for this mere pittance the members receive not only the\nmonthly magazine, _Pearls of Healing_, but the privilege of sending\nright to the president, our revered Mother Dobbs, any questions\nregarding spiritual progress, matrimonial problems, health and\nwell-being questions, financial difficulties, and--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey listened to her with adoring attention. They looked genteel. They\nlooked ironed-out. They coughed politely, and crossed their legs with\nquietness, and in expensive linen handkerchiefs they blew their noses\nwith a delicacy altogether optimistic and refined.\n\nAs for Babbitt, he sat and suffered.\n\nWhen they were blessedly out in the air again, when they drove home\nthrough a wind smelling of snow and honest sun, he dared not speak. They\nhad been too near to quarreling, these days. Mrs. Babbitt forced it:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you enjoy Mrs. Mudge\xe2\x80\x99s talk?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell I-- What did you get out of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it starts a person thinking. It gets you out of a routine of\nordinary thoughts.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll hand it to Opal she isn\xe2\x80\x99t ordinary, but gosh-- Honest, did\nthat stuff mean anything to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I\xe2\x80\x99m not trained in metaphysics, and there was lots I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\nquite grasp, but I did feel it was inspiring. And she speaks so readily.\nI do think you ought to have got something out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t! I swear, I was simply astonished, the way those women\nlapped it up! Why the dickens they want to put in their time listening\nto all that blaa when they--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s certainly better for them than going to roadhouses and smoking and\ndrinking!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether it is or not! Personally I don\xe2\x80\x99t see a whole lot\nof difference. In both cases they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get away from\nthemselves--most everybody is, these days, I guess. And I\xe2\x80\x99d certainly\nget a whole lot more out of hoofing it in a good lively dance, even in\nsome dive, than sitting looking as if my collar was too tight, and\nfeeling too scared to spit, and listening to Opal chewing her words.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you do! You\xe2\x80\x99re very fond of dives. No doubt you saw a lot of\nthem while I was away!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here! You been doing a hell of a lot of insinuating and hinting\naround lately, as if I were leading a double life or something, and I\xe2\x80\x99m\ndamn sick of it, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear anything more about it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, George Babbitt! Do you realize what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying? Why, George, in\nall our years together you\xe2\x80\x99ve never talked to me like that!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about time then!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLately you\xe2\x80\x99ve been getting worse and worse, and now, finally, you\xe2\x80\x99re\ncursing and swearing at me and shouting at me, and your voice so ugly\nand hateful-- I just shudder!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, rats, quit exaggerating! I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t shouting, or swearing either.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you could hear your own voice! Maybe you don\xe2\x80\x99t realize how it\nsounds. But even so-- You never used to talk like that. You simply\n_couldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ talk this way if something dreadful hadn\xe2\x80\x99t happened to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHis mind was hard. With amazement he found that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly\nsorry. It was only with an effort that he made himself more agreeable:\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, gosh, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to get sore.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge, do you realize that we can\xe2\x80\x99t go on like this, getting farther\nand farther apart, and you ruder and ruder to me? I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe had a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pity for her bewilderment; he thought of how many deep\nand tender things would be hurt if they really \xe2\x80\x9ccouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go on like\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d But his pity was impersonal, and he was wondering, \xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it\nmaybe be a good thing if-- Not a divorce and all that, o\xe2\x80\x99 course, but\nkind of a little more independence?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhile she looked at him pleadingly he drove on in a dreadful silence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n\nI\n\nWhen he was away from her, while he kicked about the garage and swept\nthe snow off the running-board and examined a cracked hose-connection,\nhe repented, he was alarmed and astonished that he could have flared out\nat his wife, and thought fondly how much more lasting she was than the\nflighty Bunch. He went in to mumble that he was \xe2\x80\x9csorry, didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to\nbe grouchy,\xe2\x80\x9d and to inquire as to her interest in movies. But in the\ndarkness of the movie theater he brooded that he\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x9cgone and tied\nhimself up to Myra all over again.\xe2\x80\x9d He had some satisfaction in taking\nit out on Tanis Judique. \xe2\x80\x9cHang Tanis anyway! Why\xe2\x80\x99d she gone and got him\ninto these mix-ups and made him all jumpy and nervous and cranky? Too\nmany complications! Cut \xe2\x80\x99em out!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe wanted peace. For ten days he did not see Tanis nor telephone to her,\nand instantly she put upon him the compulsion which he hated. When he\nhad stayed away from her for five days, hourly taking pride in his\nresoluteness and hourly picturing how greatly Tanis must miss him, Miss\nMcGoun reported, \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Judique on the \xe2\x80\x99phone. Like t\xe2\x80\x99 speak t\xe2\x80\x99 you \xe2\x80\x99bout\nsome repairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTanis was quick and quiet:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Babbitt? Oh, George, this is Tanis. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen you for\nweeks--days, anyway. You aren\xe2\x80\x99t sick, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, just been terribly rushed. I, uh, I think there\xe2\x80\x99ll be a big revival\nof building this year. Got to, uh, got to work hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, my man! I want you to. You know I\xe2\x80\x99m terribly ambitious for\nyou; much more than I am for myself. I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to forget\npoor Tanis. Will you call me up soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure! Sure! You bet!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease do. I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t call you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe meditated, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor kid!... But gosh, she oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to \xe2\x80\x99phone me at the\noffice.... She\xe2\x80\x99s a wonder--sympathy--\xe2\x80\x98ambitious for me.\xe2\x80\x99... But gosh, I\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be made and compelled to call her up till I get ready. Darn these\nwomen, the way they make demands! It\xe2\x80\x99ll be one long old time before I\nsee her!... But gosh, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see her to-night--sweet little\nthing.... Oh, cut that, son! Now you\xe2\x80\x99ve broken away, be wise!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe did not telephone again, nor he, but after five more days she wrote\nto him:\n\n     Have I offended you? You must know, dear, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to. I\xe2\x80\x99m so\n     lonely and I need somebody to cheer me up. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you come to\n     the nice party we had at Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s last evening I remember she\n     invited you. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you come around here to-morrow Thur evening? I\n     shall be alone and hope to see you.\n\nHis reflections were numerous:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoggone it, why can\xe2\x80\x99t she let me alone? Why can\xe2\x80\x99t women ever learn a\nfellow hates to be bulldozed? And they always take advantage of you by\nyelling how lonely they are.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow that isn\xe2\x80\x99t nice of you, young fella. She\xe2\x80\x99s a fine, square, straight\ngirl, and she does get lonely. She writes a swell hand. Nice-looking\nstationery. Plain. Refined. I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go see her. Well, thank\nGod, I got till to-morrow night free of her, anyway.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s nice but-- Hang it, I won\xe2\x80\x99t be _made_ to do things! I\xe2\x80\x99m not\nmarried to her. No, nor by golly going to be!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, rats, I suppose I better go see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nII\n\nThursday, the to-morrow of Tanis\xe2\x80\x99s note, was full of emotional crises.\nAt the Roughnecks\xe2\x80\x99 Table at the club, Verg Gunch talked of the Good\nCitizens\xe2\x80\x99 League and (it seemed to Babbitt) deliberately left him out of\nthe invitations to join. Old Mat Penniman, the general utility man at\nBabbitt\xe2\x80\x99s office, had Troubles, and came in to groan about them: his\noldest boy was \xe2\x80\x9cno good,\xe2\x80\x9d his wife was sick, and he had quarreled with\nhis brother-in-law. Conrad Lyte also had Troubles, and since Lyte was\none of his best clients, Babbitt had to listen to them. Mr. Lyte, it\nappeared, was suffering from a peculiarly interesting neuralgia, and the\ngarage had overcharged him. When Babbitt came home, everybody had\nTroubles: his wife was simultaneously thinking about discharging the\nimpudent new maid, and worried lest the maid leave; and Tinka desired to\ndenounce her teacher.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, quit fussing!\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt fussed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou never hear me whining about my\nTroubles, and yet if you had to run a real-estate office-- Why, to-day I\nfound Miss Bannigan was two days behind with her accounts, and I pinched\nmy finger in my desk, and Lyte was in and just as unreasonable as ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe was so vexed that after dinner, when it was time for a tactful escape\nto Tanis, he merely grumped to his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cGot to go out. Be back by\neleven, should think.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! You\xe2\x80\x99re going out again?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgain! What do you mean \xe2\x80\x98again\xe2\x80\x99! Haven\xe2\x80\x99t hardly been out of the house\nfor a week!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you--are you going to the Elks?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNope. Got to see some people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThough this time he heard his own voice and knew that it was curt,\nthough she was looking at him with wide-eyed reproach, he stumped into\nthe hall, jerked on his ulster and fur-lined gloves, and went out to\nstart the car.\n\nHe was relieved to find Tanis cheerful, unreproachful, and brilliant in\na frock of brown net over gold tissue. \xe2\x80\x9cYou poor man, having to come out\non a night like this! It\xe2\x80\x99s terribly cold. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think a small\nhighball would be nice?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, by golly, there\xe2\x80\x99s a woman with savvy! I think we could more or\nless stand a highball if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too long a one--not over a foot\ntall!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe kissed her with careless heartiness, he forgot the compulsion of her\ndemands, he stretched in a large chair and felt that he had beautifully\ncome home. He was suddenly loquacious; he told her what a noble and\nmisunderstood man he was, and how superior to Pete, Fulton Bemis, and\nthe other men of their acquaintance; and she, bending forward, chin in\ncharming hand, brightly agreed. But when he forced himself to ask,\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, honey, how\xe2\x80\x99s things with _you_,\xe2\x80\x9d she took his duty-question\nseriously, and he discovered that she too had Troubles:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, all right but-- I did get so angry with Carrie. She told Minnie that\nI told her that Minnie was an awful tightwad, and Minnie told me Carrie\nhad told her, and of course I told her I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t said anything of the\nkind, and then Carrie found Minnie had told me, and she was simply\nfurious because Minnie had told me, and of course I was just boiling\nbecause Carrie had told her I\xe2\x80\x99d told her, and then we all met up at\nFulton\xe2\x80\x99s--his wife is away--thank heavens!--oh, there\xe2\x80\x99s the dandiest\nfloor in his house to dance on--and we were all of us simply furious at\neach other and-- Oh, I do hate that kind of a mix-up, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? I\nmean--it\xe2\x80\x99s so lacking in refinement, but-- And Mother wants to come and\nstay with me for a whole month, and of course I do love her, I suppose I\ndo, but honestly, she\xe2\x80\x99ll cramp my style something dreadful--she never\ncan learn not to comment, and she always wants to know where I\xe2\x80\x99m going\nwhen I go out evenings, and if I lie to her she always spies around and\nferrets around and finds out where I\xe2\x80\x99ve been, and then she looks like\nPatience on a Monument till I could just scream. And oh, I _must_ tell\nyou-- You know I _never_ talk about myself; I just hate people who do,\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you? But-- I feel so stupid to-night, and I know I must be boring\nyou with all this but-- What would you do about Mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe gave her facile masculine advice. She was to put off her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\nstay. She was to tell Carrie to go to the deuce. For these valuable\nrevelations she thanked him, and they ambled into the familiar gossip of\nthe Bunch. Of what a sentimental fool was Carrie. Of what a lazy brat\nwas Pete. Of how nice Fulton Bemis could be--\xe2\x80\x9ccourse lots of people\nthink he\xe2\x80\x99s a regular old grouch when they meet him because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\ngive \xe2\x80\x99em the glad hand the first crack out of the box, but when they get\nto know him, he\xe2\x80\x99s a corker.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut as they had gone conscientiously through each of these analyses\nbefore, the conversation staggered. Babbitt tried to be intellectual and\ndeal with General Topics. He said some thoroughly sound things about\nDisarmament, and broad-mindedness and liberalism; but it seemed to him\nthat General Topics interested Tanis only when she could apply them to\nPete, Carrie, or themselves. He was distressingly conscious of their\nsilence. He tried to stir her into chattering again, but silence rose\nlike a gray presence and hovered between them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, uh--\xe2\x80\x9d he labored. \xe2\x80\x9cIt strikes me--it strikes me that unemployment is\nlessening.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe Pete will get a decent job, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSilence.\n\nDesperately he essayed, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble, old honey? You seem kind of\nquiet to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I? Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not. But--do you really care whether I am or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCare? Sure! Course I do!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really?\xe2\x80\x9d She swooped on him, sat on the arm of his chair.\n\nHe hated the emotional drain of having to appear fond of her. He\nstroked her hand, smiled up at her dutifully, and sank back.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge, I wonder if you really like me at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourse I do, silly.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really, precious? Do you care a bit?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy certainly! You don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I\xe2\x80\x99d be here if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow see here, young man, I won\xe2\x80\x99t have you speaking to me in that huffy\nway!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to sound huffy. I just--\xe2\x80\x9d In injured and rather childish\ntones: \xe2\x80\x9cGosh almighty, it makes me tired the way everybody says I sound\nhuffy when I just talk natural! Do they expect me to sing it or\nsomething?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho do you mean by \xe2\x80\x98everybody\xe2\x80\x99? How many other ladies have you been\nconsoling?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here now, I won\xe2\x80\x99t have this hinting!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHumbly: \xe2\x80\x9cI know, dear. I was only teasing. I know it didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to talk\nhuffy--it was just tired. Forgive bad Tanis. But say you love me, say\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love you.... Course I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you do!\xe2\x80\x9d cynically. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, darling, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be rude but-- I\nget so lonely. I feel so useless. Nobody needs me, nothing I can do for\nanybody. And you know, dear, I\xe2\x80\x99m so active-- I could be if there was\nsomething to do. And I _am_ young, aren\xe2\x80\x99t I! I\xe2\x80\x99m not an old thing! I\xe2\x80\x99m\nnot old and stupid, am I?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe had to assure her. She stroked his hair, and he had to look pleased\nunder that touch, the more demanding in its beguiling softness. He was\nimpatient. He wanted to flee out to a hard, sure, unemotional man-world.\nThrough her delicate and caressing fingers she may have caught something\nof his shrugging distaste. She left him--he was for the moment buoyantly\nrelieved--she dragged a footstool to his feet and sat looking\nbeseechingly up at him. But as in many men the cringing of a dog, the\nflinching of a frightened child, rouse not pity but a surprised and\njerky cruelty, so her humility only annoyed him. And he saw her now as\nmiddle-aged, as beginning to be old. Even while he detested his own\nthoughts, they rode him. She was old, he winced. Old! He noted how the\nsoft flesh was creasing into webby folds beneath her chin, below her\neyes, at the base of her wrists. A patch of her throat had a minute\nroughness like the crumbs from a rubber eraser. Old! She was younger in\nyears than himself, yet it was sickening to have her yearning up at him\nwith rolling great eyes--as if, he shuddered, his own aunt were making\nlove to him.\n\nHe fretted inwardly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m through with this asinine fooling around. I\xe2\x80\x99m\ngoing to cut her out. She\xe2\x80\x99s a darn decent nice woman, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\nto hurt her, but it\xe2\x80\x99ll hurt a lot less to cut her right out, like a good\nclean surgical operation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe was on his feet. He was speaking urgently. By every rule of\nself-esteem, he had to prove to her, and to himself, that it was her\nfault.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of out of sorts to-night, but honest, honey,\nwhen I stayed away for a while to catch up on work and everything and\nfigure out where I was at, you ought to have been cannier and waited\ntill I came back. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you see, dear, when you _made_ me come, I--being\nabout an average bull-headed chump--my tendency was to resist? Listen,\ndear, I\xe2\x80\x99m going now--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for a while, precious! No!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYep. Right now. And then sometime we\xe2\x80\x99ll see about the future.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, dear, \xe2\x80\x98about the future\xe2\x80\x99? Have I done something I\noughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to? Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so dreadfully sorry!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe resolutely put his hands behind him. \xe2\x80\x9cNot a thing, God bless you, not\na thing. You\xe2\x80\x99re as good as they make \xe2\x80\x99em. But it\xe2\x80\x99s just-- Good Lord, do\nyou realize I\xe2\x80\x99ve got things to do in the world? I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a business to\nattend to and, you might not believe it, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a wife and kids\nthat I\xe2\x80\x99m awful fond of!\xe2\x80\x9d Then only during the murder he was committing\nwas he able to feel nobly virtuous. \xe2\x80\x9cI want us to be friends but, gosh,\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t go on this way feeling I _got_ to come up here every so often--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, darling, darling, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve always told you, so carefully, that you\nwere absolutely free. I just wanted you to come around when you were\ntired and wanted to talk to me, or when you could enjoy our parties--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe was so reasonable, she was so gently right! It took him an hour to\nmake his escape, with nothing settled and everything horribly settled.\nIn a barren freedom of icy Northern wind he sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cThank God that\xe2\x80\x99s\nover! Poor Tanis, poor darling decent Tanis! But it is over. Absolute!\nI\xe2\x80\x99m free!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n\nI\n\nHis wife was up when he came in. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you have a good time?\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsniffed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not. I had a rotten time! Anything else I got to explain?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge, how can you speak like-- Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s come over you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing come over me! Why do you look for trouble\nall the time?\xe2\x80\x9d He was warning himself, \xe2\x80\x9cCareful! Stop being so\ndisagreeable. Course she feels it, being left alone here all evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut he forgot his warning as she went on:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you go out and see all sorts of strange people? I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ll\nsay you\xe2\x80\x99ve been to another committee-meeting this evening!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNope. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been calling on a woman. We sat by the fire and kidded each\nother and had a whale of a good time, if you want to know!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell-- From the way you say it, I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s my fault you went there!\nI probably sent you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, upon my word--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hate \xe2\x80\x98strange people\xe2\x80\x99 as you call \xe2\x80\x99em. If you had your way, I\xe2\x80\x99d be\nas much of an old stick-in-the-mud as Howard Littlefield. You never want\nto have anybody with any git to \xe2\x80\x99em at the house; you want a bunch of\nold stiffs that sit around and gas about the weather. You\xe2\x80\x99re doing your\nlevel best to make me old. Well, let me tell you, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to\nhave--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOverwhelmed she bent to his unprecedented tirade, and in answer she\nmourned:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dearest, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s true. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to make you old, I\nknow. Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99re partly right. Perhaps I am slow about getting\nacquainted with new people. But when you think of all the dear good\ntimes we have, and the supper-parties and the movies and all--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith true masculine wiles he not only convinced himself that she had\ninjured him but, by the loudness of his voice and the brutality of his\nattack, he convinced her also, and presently he had her apologizing for\nhis having spent the evening with Tanis. He went up to bed well pleased,\nnot only the master but the martyr of the household. For a distasteful\nmoment after he had lain down he wondered if he had been altogether\njust. \xe2\x80\x9cOught to be ashamed, bullying her. Maybe there is her side to\nthings. Maybe she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had such a bloomin\xe2\x80\x99 hectic time herself. But I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care! Good for her to get waked up a little. And I\xe2\x80\x99m going to keep\nfree. Of her and Tanis and the fellows at the club and everybody. I\xe2\x80\x99m\ngoing to run my own life!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nII\n\nIn this mood he was particularly objectionable at the Boosters\xe2\x80\x99 Club\nlunch next day. They were addressed by a congressman who had just\nreturned from an exhaustive three-months study of the finances,\nethnology, political systems, linguistic divisions, mineral resources,\nand agriculture of Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy, Austria,\nCzechoslovakia, Jugoslavia, and Bulgaria. He told them all about those\nsubjects, together with three funny stories about European\nmisconceptions of America and some spirited words on the necessity of\nkeeping ignorant foreigners out of America.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, that was a mighty informative talk. Real he-stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sidney\nFinkelstein.\n\nBut the disaffected Babbitt grumbled, \xe2\x80\x9cFour-flusher! Bunch of hot air!\nAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with the immigrants? Gosh, they aren\xe2\x80\x99t all\nignorant, and I got a hunch we\xe2\x80\x99re all descended from immigrants\nourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you make me tired!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Finkelstein.\n\nBabbitt was aware that Dr. A. I. Dilling was sternly listening from\nacross the table. Dr. Dilling was one of the most important men in the\nBoosters\xe2\x80\x99. He was not a physician but a surgeon, a more romantic and\nsounding occupation. He was an intense large man with a boiling of black\nhair and a thick black mustache. The newspapers often chronicled his\noperations; he was professor of surgery in the State University; he went\nto dinner at the very best houses on Royal Ridge; and he was said to be\nworth several hundred thousand dollars. It was dismaying to Babbitt to\nhave such a person glower at him. He hastily praised the congressman\xe2\x80\x99s\nwit, to Sidney Finkelstein, but for Dr. Dilling\xe2\x80\x99s benefit.\n\n\nIII\n\nThat afternoon three men shouldered into Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s office with the air\nof a Vigilante committee in frontier days. They were large, resolute,\nbig-jawed men, and they were all high lords in the land of Zenith--Dr.\nDilling the surgeon, Charles McKelvey the contractor, and, most\ndismaying of all, the white-bearded Colonel Rutherford Snow, owner of\nthe _Advocate-Times_. In their whelming presence Babbitt felt small and\ninsignificant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, great pleasure, have chairs, what c\xe2\x80\x99n I do for you?\xe2\x80\x9d he\nbabbled.\n\nThey neither sat nor offered observations on the weather.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBabbitt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colonel Snow, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve come from the Good Citizens\xe2\x80\x99\nLeague. We\xe2\x80\x99ve decided we want you to join. Vergil Gunch says you don\xe2\x80\x99t\ncare to, but I think we can show you a new light. The League is going to\ncombine with the Chamber of Commerce in a campaign for the Open Shop,\nso it\xe2\x80\x99s time for you to put your name down.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn his embarrassment Babbitt could not recall his reasons for not\nwishing to join the League, if indeed he had ever definitely known them,\nbut he was passionately certain that he did not wish to join, and at the\nthought of their forcing him he felt a stirring of anger against even\nthese princes of commerce.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSorry, Colonel, have to think it over a little,\xe2\x80\x9d he mumbled.\n\nMcKelvey snarled, \xe2\x80\x9cThat means you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to join, George?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSomething black and unfamiliar and ferocious spoke from Babbitt: \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\nyou look here, Charley! I\xe2\x80\x99m damned if I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be bullied into\njoining anything, not even by you plutes!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not bullying anybody,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Billing began, but Colonel Snow thrust\nhim aside with, \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly we are! We don\xe2\x80\x99t mind a little bullying, if\nit\xe2\x80\x99s necessary. Babbitt, the G.C.L. has been talking about you a good\ndeal. You\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be a sensible, clean, responsible man; you\nalways have been; but here lately, for God knows what reason, I hear\nfrom all sorts of sources that you\xe2\x80\x99re running around with a loose crowd,\nand what\xe2\x80\x99s a whole lot worse, you\xe2\x80\x99ve actually been advocating and\nsupporting some of the most dangerous elements in town, like this fellow\nDoane.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cColonel, that strikes me as my private business.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly, but we want to have an understanding. You\xe2\x80\x99ve stood in, you\nand your father-in-law, with some of the most substantial and\nforward-looking interests in town, like my friends of the Street\nTraction Company, and my papers have given you a lot of boosts. Well,\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t expect the decent citizens to go on aiding you if you intend\nto side with precisely the people who are trying to undermine us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt was frightened, but he had an agonized instinct that if he\nyielded in this he would yield in everything. He protested:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re exaggerating, Colonel. I believe in being broad-minded and\nliberal, but, of course, I\xe2\x80\x99m just as much agin the cranks and\nblatherskites and labor unions and so on as you are. But fact is, I\nbelong to so many organizations now that I can\xe2\x80\x99t do \xe2\x80\x99em justice, and I\nwant to think it over before I decide about coming into the G.C.L.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nColonel Snow condescended, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not exaggerating! Why the doctor\nhere heard you cussing out and defaming one of the finest types of\nRepublican congressmen, just this noon! And you have entirely the wrong\nidea about \xe2\x80\x98thinking over joining.\xe2\x80\x99 We\xe2\x80\x99re not begging you to join the\nG.C.L.--we\xe2\x80\x99re permitting you to join. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure, my boy, but what if\nyou put it off it\xe2\x80\x99ll be too late. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll want you then.\nBetter think quick--better think quick!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe three Vigilantes, formidable in their righteousness, stared at him\nin a taut silence. Babbitt waited through. He thought nothing at all, he\nmerely waited, while in his echoing head buzzed, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\njoin-- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to join-- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. Sorry for you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Colonel Snow, and the three men\nabruptly turned their beefy backs.\n\n\nIV\n\nAs Babbitt went out to his car that evening he saw Vergil Gunch coming\ndown the block. He raised his hand in salutation, but Gunch ignored it\nand crossed the street. He was certain that Gunch had seen him. He drove\nhome in sharp discomfort.\n\nHis wife attacked at once: \xe2\x80\x9cGeorgie dear, Muriel Frink was in this\nafternoon, and she says that Chum says the committee of this Good\nCitizens\xe2\x80\x99 League especially asked you to join and you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\nyou think it would be better? You know all the nicest people belong, and\nthe League stands for--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what the League stands for! It stands for the suppression of\nfree speech and free thought and everything else! I don\xe2\x80\x99t propose to be\nbullied and rushed into joining anything, and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a question of\nwhether it\xe2\x80\x99s a good league or a bad league or what the hell kind of a\nleague it is; it\xe2\x80\x99s just a question of my refusing to be told I got to--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut dear, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t join, people might criticize you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet \xe2\x80\x99em criticize!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I mean _nice_ people!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRats, I-- Matter of fact, this whole League is just a fad. It\xe2\x80\x99s like all\nthese other organizations that start off with such a rush and let on\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re going to change the whole works, and pretty soon they peter out\nand everybody forgets all about \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if it\xe2\x80\x99s _the_ fad now, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think you--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t! Oh, Myra, please quit nagging me about it. I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of\nhearing about the confounded G.C.L. I almost wish I\xe2\x80\x99d joined it when\nVerg first came around, and got it over. And maybe I\xe2\x80\x99d\xe2\x80\x99ve come in to-day\nif the committee hadn\xe2\x80\x99t tried to bullyrag me, but, by God, as long as\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a free-born independent American cit--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, George, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking exactly like the German furnace-man.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am, am I! Then, I won\xe2\x80\x99t talk at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe longed, that evening, to see Tanis Judique, to be strengthened by her\nsympathy. When all the family were up-stairs he got as far as\ntelephoning to her apartment-house, but he was agitated about it and\nwhen the janitor answered he blurted, \xe2\x80\x9cNev\xe2\x80\x99 mind-- I\xe2\x80\x99ll call later,\xe2\x80\x9d and\nhung up the receiver.\n\n\nV\n\nIf Babbitt had not been certain about Vergil Gunch\xe2\x80\x99s avoiding him, there\ncould be little doubt about William Washington Eathorne, next morning.\nWhen Babbitt was driving down to the office he overtook Eathorne\xe2\x80\x99s car,\nwith the great banker sitting in anemic solemnity behind his chauffeur.\nBabbitt waved and cried, \xe2\x80\x9cMornin\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d Eathorne looked at him deliberately,\nhesitated, and gave him a nod more contemptuous than a direct cut.\n\nBabbitt\xe2\x80\x99s partner and father-in-law came in at ten:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge, what\xe2\x80\x99s this I hear about some song and dance you gave Colonel\nSnow about not wanting to join the G.C.L.? What the dickens you trying\nto do? Wreck the firm? You don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose these Big Guns will stand your\nbucking them and springing all this \xe2\x80\x98liberal\xe2\x80\x99 poppycock you been getting\noff lately, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, rats, Henry T., you been reading bum fiction. There ain\xe2\x80\x99t any such\na thing as these plots to keep folks from being liberal. This is a free\ncountry. A man can do anything he wants to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourse th\xe2\x80\x99 ain\xe2\x80\x99t any plots. Who said they was? Only if folks get an\nidea you\xe2\x80\x99re scatter-brained and unstable, you don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose they\xe2\x80\x99ll want\nto do business with you, do you? One little rumor about your being a\ncrank would do more to ruin this business than all the plots and stuff\nthat these fool story-writers could think up in a month of Sundays.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThat afternoon, when the old reliable Conrad Lyte, the merry miser,\nConrad Lyte, appeared, and Babbitt suggested his buying a parcel of land\nin the new residential section of Dorchester, Lyte said hastily, too\nhastily, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go into anything new just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA week later Babbitt learned, through Henry Thompson, that the officials\nof the Street Traction Company were planning another real-estate coup,\nand that Sanders, Torrey and Wing, not the Babbitt-Thompson Company,\nwere to handle it for them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI figure that Jake Offutt is kind of leery about the way folks are\ntalking about you. Of course Jake is a rock-ribbed old die-hard, and he\nprobably advised the Traction fellows to get some other broker. George,\nyou got to do something!\xe2\x80\x9d trembled Thompson.\n\nAnd, in a rush, Babbitt agreed. All nonsense the way people misjudged\nhim, but still-- He determined to join the Good Citizens\xe2\x80\x99 League the next\ntime he was asked, and in furious resignation he waited. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\nasked. They ignored him. He did not have the courage to go to the League\nand beg in, and he took refuge in a shaky boast that he had \xe2\x80\x9cgotten away\nwith bucking the whole city. Nobody could dictate to _him_ how he was\ngoing to think and act!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe was jarred as by nothing else when the paragon of stenographers, Miss\nMcGoun, suddenly left him, though her reasons were excellent--she needed\na rest, her sister was sick, she might not do any more work for six\nmonths. He was uncomfortable with her successor, Miss Havstad. What Miss\nHavstad\xe2\x80\x99s given name was, no one in the office ever knew. It seemed\nimprobable that she had a given name, a lover, a powder-puff, or a\ndigestion. She was so impersonal, this slight, pale, industrious Swede,\nthat it was vulgar to think of her as going to an ordinary home to eat\nhash. She was a perfectly oiled and enameled machine, and she ought,\neach evening, to have been dusted off and shut in her desk beside her\ntoo-slim, too-frail pencil points. She took dictation swiftly, her\ntyping was perfect, but Babbitt became jumpy when he tried to work with\nher. She made him feel puffy, and at his best-beloved daily jokes she\nlooked gently inquiring. He longed for Miss McGoun\xe2\x80\x99s return, and thought\nof writing to her.\n\nThen he heard that Miss McGoun had, a week after leaving him, gone over\nto his dangerous competitors, Sanders, Torrey and Wing.\n\nHe was not merely annoyed; he was frightened. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did she quit, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe worried. \xe2\x80\x9cDid she have a hunch my business is going on the rocks? And\nit was Sanders got the Street Traction deal. Rats--sinking ship!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGray fear loomed always by him now. He watched Fritz Weilinger, the\nyoung salesman, and wondered if he too would leave. Daily he fancied\nslights. He noted that he was not asked to speak at the annual Chamber\nof Commerce dinner. When Orville Jones gave a large poker party and he\nwas not invited, he was certain that he had been snubbed. He was afraid\nto go to lunch at the Athletic Club, and afraid not to go. He believed\nthat he was spied on; that when he left the table they whispered about\nhim. Everywhere he heard the rustling whispers: in the offices of\nclients, in the bank when he made a deposit, in his own office, in his\nown home. Interminably he wondered what They were saying of him. All day\nlong in imaginary conversations he caught them marveling, \xe2\x80\x9cBabbitt? Why,\nsay, he\xe2\x80\x99s a regular anarchist! You got to admire the fellow for his\nnerve, the way he turned liberal and, by golly, just absolutely runs his\nlife to suit himself, but say, he\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous, that\xe2\x80\x99s what he is, and\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s got to be shown up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe was so twitchy that when he rounded a corner and chanced on two\nacquaintances talking--whispering--his heart leaped, and he stalked by\nlike an embarrassed schoolboy. When he saw his neighbors Howard\nLittlefield and Orville Jones together, he peered at them, went indoors\nto escape their spying, and was miserably certain that they had been\nwhispering--plotting--whispering.\n\nThrough all his fear ran defiance. He felt stubborn. Sometimes he\ndecided that he had been a very devil of a fellow, as bold as Seneca\nDoane; sometimes he planned to call on Doane and tell him what a\nrevolutionist he was, and never got beyond the planning. But just as\noften, when he heard the soft whispers enveloping him he wailed, \xe2\x80\x9cGood\nLord, what have I done? Just played with the Bunch, and called down\nClarence Drum about being such a high-and-mighty sodger. Never catch\n_me_ criticizing people and trying to make them accept _my_ ideas!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe could not stand the strain. Before long he admitted that he would\nlike to flee back to the security of conformity, provided there was a\ndecent and creditable way to return. But, stubbornly, he would not be\nforced back; he would not, he swore, \xe2\x80\x9ceat dirt.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOnly in spirited engagements with his wife did these turbulent fears\nrise to the surface. She complained that he seemed nervous, that she\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand why he did not want to \xe2\x80\x9cdrop in at the\nLittlefields\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d for the evening. He tried, but he could not express to\nher the nebulous facts of his rebellion and punishment. And, with Paul\nand Tanis lost, he had no one to whom he could talk. \xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord, Tinka\nis the only real friend I have, these days,\xe2\x80\x9d he sighed, and he clung to\nthe child, played floor-games with her all evening.\n\nHe considered going to see Paul in prison, but, though he had a pale\ncurt note from him every week, he thought of Paul as dead. It was Tanis\nfor whom he was longing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I was so smart and independent, cutting Tanis out, and I need\nher, Lord how I need her!\xe2\x80\x9d he raged. \xe2\x80\x9cMyra simply can\xe2\x80\x99t understand. All\nshe sees in life is getting along by being just like other folks. But\nTanis, she\xe2\x80\x99d tell me I was all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen he broke, and one evening, late, he did run to Tanis. He had not\ndared to hope for it, but she was in, and alone. Only she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Tanis.\nShe was a courteous, brow-lifting, ice-armored woman who looked like\nTanis. She said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, George, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d in even and uninterested\ntones, and he crept away, whipped.\n\nHis first comfort was from Ted and Eunice Littlefield.\n\nThey danced in one evening when Ted was home from the university, and\nTed chuckled, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this I hear from Euny, dad? She says her dad says\nyou raised Cain by boosting old Seneca Doane. Hot dog! Give \xe2\x80\x99em fits!\nStir \xe2\x80\x99em up! This old burg is asleep!\xe2\x80\x9d Eunice plumped down on Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s\nlap, kissed him, nestled her bobbed hair against his chin, and crowed,\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99re lots nicer than Howard. Why is it,\xe2\x80\x9d confidentially,\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat Howard is such an old grouch? The man has a good heart, and\nhonestly, he\xe2\x80\x99s awfully bright, but he never will learn to step on the\ngas, after all the training I\xe2\x80\x99ve given him. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think we could do\nsomething with him, dearest?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Eunice, that isn\xe2\x80\x99t a nice way to speak of your papa,\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt\nobserved, in the best Floral Heights manner, but he was happy for the\nfirst time in weeks. He pictured himself as the veteran liberal\nstrengthened by the loyalty of the young generation. They went out to\nrifle the ice-box. Babbitt gloated, \xe2\x80\x9cIf your mother caught us at this,\nwe\xe2\x80\x99d certainly get our come-uppance!\xe2\x80\x9d and Eunice became maternal,\nscrambled a terrifying number of eggs for them, kissed Babbitt on the\near, and in the voice of a brooding abbess marveled, \xe2\x80\x9cIt beats the devil\nwhy feminists like me still go on nursing these men!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThus stimulated, Babbitt was reckless when he encountered Sheldon\nSmeeth, educational director of the Y.M.C.A. and choir-leader of the\nChatham Road Church. With one of his damp hands Smeeth imprisoned\nBabbitt\xe2\x80\x99s thick paw while he chanted, \xe2\x80\x9cBrother Babbitt, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen\nyou at church very often lately. I know you\xe2\x80\x99re busy with a multitude of\ndetails, but you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t forget your dear friends at the old church\nhome.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt shook off the affectionate clasp--Sheldy liked to hold hands for\na long time--and snarled, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I guess you fellows can run the show\nwithout me. Sorry, Smeeth; got to beat it. G\xe2\x80\x99day.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut afterward he winced, \xe2\x80\x9cIf that white worm had the nerve to try to\ndrag me back to the Old Church Home, then the holy outfit must have been\ndoing a lot of talking about me, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe heard them whispering--whispering--Dr. John Jennison Drew,\nCholmondeley Frink, even William Washington Eathorne. The independence\nseeped out of him and he walked the streets alone, afraid of men\xe2\x80\x99s\ncynical eyes and the incessant hiss of whispering.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n\nI\n\nHe tried to explain to his wife, as they prepared for bed, how\nobjectionable was Sheldon Smeeth, but all her answer was, \xe2\x80\x9cHe has such a\nbeautiful voice--so spiritual. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you ought to speak of him\nlike that just because you can\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate music!\xe2\x80\x9d He saw her then as a\nstranger; he stared bleakly at this plump and fussy woman with the broad\nbare arms, and wondered how she had ever come here.\n\nIn his chilly cot, turning from aching side to side, he pondered of\nTanis. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d been a fool to lose her. He had to have somebody he could\nreally talk to. He\xe2\x80\x99d--oh, he\xe2\x80\x99d _bust_ if he went on stewing about things\nby himself. And Myra, useless to expect her to understand. Well, rats,\nno use dodging the issue. Darn shame for two married people to drift\napart after all these years; darn rotten shame; but nothing could bring\nthem together now, as long as he refused to let Zenith bully him into\ntaking orders--and he was by golly not going to let anybody bully him\ninto anything, or wheedle him or coax him either!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe woke at three, roused by a passing motor, and struggled out of bed\nfor a drink of water. As he passed through the bedroom he heard his wife\ngroan. His resentment was night-blurred; he was solicitous in inquiring,\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble, hon?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got--such a pain down here in my side--oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s just--it tears at\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBad indigestion? Shall I get you some bicarb?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think--that would help. I felt funny last evening and yesterday,\nand then--oh!--it passed away and I got to sleep and-- That auto woke me\nup.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHer voice was laboring like a ship in a storm. He was alarmed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI better call the doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! It\xe2\x80\x99ll go away. But maybe you might get me an ice-bag.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe stalked to the bathroom for the ice-bag, down to the kitchen for ice.\nHe felt dramatic in this late-night expedition, but as he gouged the\nchunk of ice with the dagger-like pick he was cool, steady, mature; and\nthe old friendliness was in his voice as he patted the ice-bag into\nplace on her groin, rumbling, \xe2\x80\x9cThere, there, that\xe2\x80\x99ll be better now.\xe2\x80\x9d He\nretired to bed, but he did not sleep. He heard her groan again.\nInstantly he was up, soothing her, \xe2\x80\x9cStill pretty bad, honey?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it just gripes me, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t get to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHer voice was faint. He knew her dread of doctors\xe2\x80\x99 verdicts and he did\nnot inform her, but he creaked down-stairs, telephoned to Dr. Earl\nPatten, and waited, shivering, trying with fuzzy eyes to read a\nmagazine, till he heard the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s car.\n\nThe doctor was youngish and professionally breezy. He came in as though\nit were sunny noontime. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, George, little trouble, eh? How is she\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d he said busily as, with tremendous and rather irritating\ncheerfulness, he tossed his coat on a chair and warmed his hands at a\nradiator. He took charge of the house. Babbitt felt ousted and\nunimportant as he followed the doctor up to the bedroom, and it was the\ndoctor who chuckled, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, just little stomach-ache\xe2\x80\x9d when Verona peeped\nthrough her door, begging, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Dad, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTo Mrs. Babbitt the doctor said with amiable belligerence, after his\nexamination, \xe2\x80\x9cKind of a bad old pain, eh? I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you something to\nmake you sleep, and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll feel better in the morning. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come\nin right after breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d But to Babbitt, lying in wait in the lower\nhall, the doctor sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like the feeling there in her belly.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s some rigidity and some inflammation. She\xe2\x80\x99s never had her\nappendix out, has she? Um. Well, no use worrying. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be here first\nthing in the morning, and meantime she\xe2\x80\x99ll get some rest. I\xe2\x80\x99ve given her\na hypo. Good night.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen was Babbitt caught up in the black tempest.\n\nInstantly all the indignations which had been dominating him and the\nspiritual dramas through which he had struggled became pallid and absurd\nbefore the ancient and overwhelming realities, the standard and\ntraditional realities, of sickness and menacing death, the long night,\nand the thousand steadfast implications of married life. He crept back\nto her. As she drowsed away in the tropic languor of morphia, he sat on\nthe edge of her bed, holding her hand, and for the first time in many\nweeks her hand abode trustfully in his.\n\nHe draped himself grotesquely in his toweling bathrobe and a pink and\nwhite couch-cover, and sat lumpishly in a wing-chair. The bedroom was\nuncanny in its half-light, which turned the curtains to lurking robbers,\nthe dressing-table to a turreted castle. It smelled of cosmetics, of\nlinen, of sleep. He napped and woke, napped and woke, a hundred times.\nHe heard her move and sigh in slumber; he wondered if there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t some\nofficious brisk thing he could do for her, and before he could quite\nform the thought he was asleep, racked and aching. The night was\ninfinite. When dawn came and the waiting seemed at an end, he fell\nasleep, and was vexed to have been caught off his guard, to have been\naroused by Verona\xe2\x80\x99s entrance and her agitated \xe2\x80\x9cOh, what _is_ it, Dad?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHis wife was awake, her face sallow and lifeless in the morning light,\nbut now he did not compare her with Tanis; she was not merely A Woman,\nto be contrasted with other women, but his own self, and though he might\ncriticize her and nag her, it was only as he might criticize and nag\nhimself, interestedly, unpatronizingly, without the expectation of\nchanging--or any real desire to change--the eternal essence.\n\nWith Verona he sounded fatherly again, and firm. He consoled Tinka, who\nsatisfactorily pointed the excitement of the hour by wailing. He ordered\nearly breakfast, and wanted to look at the newspaper, and felt somehow\nheroic and useful in not looking at it. But there were still crawling\nand totally unheroic hours of waiting before Dr. Patten returned.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t see much change,\xe2\x80\x9d said Patten. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be back about eleven, and if\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring in some other world-famous\npill-pedler for consultation, just to be on the safe side. Now George,\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing you can do. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have Verona keep the ice-bag\nfilled--might as well leave that on, I guess--and you, you better beat\nit to the office instead of standing around her looking as if you were\nthe patient. The nerve of husbands! Lot more neurotic than the women!\nThey always have to horn in and get all the credit for feeling bad when\ntheir wives are ailing. Now have another nice cup of coffee and git!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nUnder this derision Babbitt became more matter-of-fact. He drove to the\noffice, tried to dictate letters, tried to telephone and, before the\ncall was answered, forgot to whom he was telephoning. At a quarter after\nten he returned home. As he left the down-town traffic and sped up the\ncar, his face was as grimly creased as the mask of tragedy.\n\nHis wife greeted him with surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you come back, dear? I\nthink I feel a little better. I told Verona to skip off to her office.\nWas it wicked of me to go and get sick?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe knew that she wanted petting, and she got it, joyously. They were\ncuriously happy when he heard Dr. Patten\xe2\x80\x99s car in front. He looked out\nof the window. He was frightened. With Patten was an impatient man with\nturbulent black hair and a hussar mustache--Dr. A. I. Dilling, the\nsurgeon. Babbitt sputtered with anxiety, tried to conceal it, and\nhurried down to the door.\n\nDr. Patten was profusely casual: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t want to worry you, old man, but\nI thought it might be a good stunt to have Dr. Dilling examine her.\xe2\x80\x9d He\ngestured toward Dilling as toward a master.\n\nBilling nodded in his curtest manner and strode up-stairs. Babbitt\ntramped the living-room in agony. Except for his wife\xe2\x80\x99s confinements\nthere had never been a major operation in the family, and to him surgery\nwas at once a miracle and an abomination of fear. But when Dilling and\nPatten came down again he knew that everything was all right, and he\nwanted to laugh, for the two doctors were exactly like the bearded\nphysicians in a musical comedy, both of them rubbing their hands and\nlooking foolishly sagacious.\n\nDr. Dilling spoke:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, old man, but it\xe2\x80\x99s acute appendicitis. We ought to operate.\nOf course you must decide, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no question as to what has to be\ndone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt did not get all the force of it. He mumbled, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I suppose we\ncould get her ready in a couple o\xe2\x80\x99 days. Probably Ted ought to come down\nfrom the university, just in case anything happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDr. Dilling growled, \xe2\x80\x9cNope. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want peritonitis to set in,\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll have to operate right away. I must advise it strongly. If you say\ngo ahead, I\xe2\x80\x99ll \xe2\x80\x99phone for the St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s ambulance at once, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll\nhave her on the table in three-quarters of an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--I-- Of course, I suppose you know what-- But great God, man, I can\xe2\x80\x99t\nget her clothes ready and everything in two seconds, you know! And in\nher state, so wrought-up and weak--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust throw her hair-brush and comb and tooth-brush in a bag; that\xe2\x80\x99s all\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll need for a day or two,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Dilling, and went to the\ntelephone.\n\nBabbitt galloped desperately up-stairs. He sent the frightened Tinka out\nof the room. He said gaily to his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, old thing, the doc thinks\nmaybe we better have a little operation and get it over. Just take a\nfew minutes--not half as serious as a confinement--and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be all\nright in a jiffy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe gripped his hand till the fingers ached. She said patiently, like a\ncowed child, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid--to go into the dark, all alone!\xe2\x80\x9d Maturity was\nwiped from her eyes; they were pleading and terrified. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you stay\nwith me? Darling, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go to the office now, do you? Could\nyou just go down to the hospital with me? Could you come see me this\nevening--if everything\xe2\x80\x99s all right? You won\xe2\x80\x99t have to go out this\nevening, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe was on his knees by the bed. While she feebly ruffled his hair, he\nsobbed, he kissed the lawn of her sleeve, and swore, \xe2\x80\x9cOld honey, I love\nyou more than anything in the world! I\xe2\x80\x99ve kind of been worried by\nbusiness and everything, but that\xe2\x80\x99s all over now, and I\xe2\x80\x99m back again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you really? George, I was thinking, lying here, maybe it would be a\ngood thing if I just _went_. I was wondering if anybody really needed\nme. Or wanted me. I was wondering what was the use of my living. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\nbeen getting so stupid and ugly--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you old humbug! Fishing for compliments when I ought to be packing\nyour bag! Me, sure, I\xe2\x80\x99m young and handsome and a regular village cut-up\nand--\xe2\x80\x9d He could not go on. He sobbed again; and in muttered\nincoherencies they found each other.\n\nAs he packed, his brain was curiously clear and swift. He\xe2\x80\x99d have no more\nwild evenings, he realized. He admitted that he would regret them. A\nlittle grimly he perceived that this had been his last despairing fling\nbefore the paralyzed contentment of middle-age. Well, and he grinned\nimpishly, \xe2\x80\x9cit was one doggone good party while it lasted!\xe2\x80\x9d And--how much\nwas the operation going to cost? \xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have fought that out with\nDilling. But no, damn it, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care how much it costs!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe motor ambulance was at the door. Even in his grief the Babbitt who\nadmired all technical excellences was interested in the kindly skill\nwith which the attendants slid Mrs. Babbitt upon a stretcher and carried\nher down-stairs. The ambulance was a huge, suave, varnished, white\nthing. Mrs. Babbitt moaned, \xe2\x80\x9cIt frightens me. It\xe2\x80\x99s just like a hearse,\njust like being put in a hearse. I want you to stay with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be right up front with the driver,\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt promised.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I want you to stay inside with me.\xe2\x80\x9d To the attendants: \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t he be\ninside?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, you bet. There\xe2\x80\x99s a fine little camp-stool in there,\xe2\x80\x9d the\nolder attendant said, with professional pride.\n\nHe sat beside her in that traveling cabin with its cot, its stool, its\nactive little electric radiator, and its quite unexplained calendar,\ndisplaying a girl eating cherries, and the name of an enterprising\ngrocer. But as he flung out his hand in hopeless cheerfulness it touched\nthe radiator, and he squealed:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOuch! Jesus!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, George Babbitt, I won\xe2\x80\x99t have you cursing and swearing and\nblaspheming!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, awful sorry but-- Gosh all fish-hooks, look how I burned my\nhand! Gee whiz, it hurts! It hurts like the mischief! Why, that damn\nradiator is hot as--it\xe2\x80\x99s hot as--it\xe2\x80\x99s hotter \xe2\x80\x99n the hinges of Hades!\nLook! You can see the mark!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo, as they drove up to St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital, with the nurses already\nlaying out the instruments for an operation to save her life, it was she\nwho consoled him and kissed the place to make it well, and though he\ntried to be gruff and mature, he yielded to her and was glad to be\nbabied.\n\nThe ambulance whirled under the hooded carriage-entrance of the\nhospital, and instantly he was reduced to a zero in the nightmare\nsuccession of cork-floored halls, endless doors open on old women\nsitting up in bed, an elevator, the anesthetizing room, a young interne\ncontemptuous of husbands. He was permitted to kiss his wife; he saw a\nthin dark nurse fit the cone over her mouth and nose; he stiffened at a\nsweet and treacherous odor; then he was driven out, and on a high stool\nin a laboratory he sat dazed, longing to see her once again, to insist\nthat he had always loved her, had never for a second loved anybody else\nor looked at anybody else. In the laboratory he was conscious only of a\ndecayed object preserved in a bottle of yellowing alcohol. It made him\nvery sick, but he could not take his eyes from it. He was more aware of\nit than of waiting. His mind floated in abeyance, coming back always to\nthat horrible bottle. To escape it he opened the door to the right,\nhoping to find a sane and business-like office. He realized that he was\nlooking into the operating-room; in one glance he took in Dr. Dilling,\nstrange in white gown and bandaged head, bending over the steel table\nwith its screws and wheels, then nurses holding basins and cotton\nsponges, and a swathed thing, just a lifeless chin and a mound of white\nin the midst of which was a square of sallow flesh with a gash a little\nbloody at the edges, protruding from the gash a cluster of forceps like\nclinging parasites.\n\nHe shut the door with haste. It may be that his frightened repentance of\nthe night and morning had not eaten in, but this dehumanizing interment\nof her who had been so pathetically human shook him utterly, and as he\ncrouched again on the high stool in the laboratory he swore faith to his\nwife... to Zenith... to business efficiency... to the Boosters\xe2\x80\x99 Club...\nto every faith of the Clan of Good Fellows.\n\nThen a nurse was soothing, \xe2\x80\x9cAll over! Perfect success! She\xe2\x80\x99ll come out\nfine! She\xe2\x80\x99ll be out from under the anesthetic soon, and you can see\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe found her on a curious tilted bed, her face an unwholesome yellow but\nher purple lips moving slightly. Then only did he really believe that\nshe was alive. She was muttering. He bent, and heard her sighing, \xe2\x80\x9cHard\nget real maple syrup for pancakes.\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed inexhaustibly; he beamed\non the nurse and proudly confided, \xe2\x80\x9cThink of her talking about maple\nsyrup! By golly, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go and order a hundred gallons of it,\nright from Vermont!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nII\n\nShe was out of the hospital in seventeen days. He went to see her each\nafternoon, and in their long talks they drifted back to intimacy. Once\nhe hinted something of his relations to Tanis and the Bunch, and she was\ninflated by the view that a Wicked Woman had captivated her poor George.\n\nIf once he had doubted his neighbors and the supreme charm of the Good\nFellows, he was convinced now. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t, he noted, \xe2\x80\x9csee Seneca Doane\ncoming around with any flowers or dropping in to chat with the Missus,\xe2\x80\x9d\nbut Mrs. Howard Littlefield brought to the hospital her priceless wine\njelly (flavored with real wine); Orville Jones spent hours in picking\nout the kind of novels Mrs. Babbitt liked--nice love stories about New\nYork millionaries and Wyoming cowpunchers; Louetta Swanson knitted a\npink bed-jacket; Sidney Finkelstein and his merry brown-eyed flapper of\na wife selected the prettiest nightgown in all the stock of Parcher and\nStein.\n\nAll his friends ceased whispering about him, suspecting him. At the\nAthletic Club they asked after her daily. Club members whose names he\ndid not know stopped him to inquire, \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s your good lady getting on?\xe2\x80\x9d\nBabbitt felt that he was swinging from bleak uplands down into the rich\nwarm air of a valley pleasant with cottages.\n\nOne noon Vergil Gunch suggested, \xe2\x80\x9cYou planning to be at the hospital\nabout six? The wife and I thought we\xe2\x80\x99d drop in.\xe2\x80\x9d They did drop in. Gunch\nwas so humorous that Mrs. Babbitt said he must \xe2\x80\x9cstop making her laugh\nbecause honestly it was hurting her incision.\xe2\x80\x9d As they passed down the\nhall Gunch demanded amiably, \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge, old scout, you were soreheaded\nabout something, here a while back. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why, and it\xe2\x80\x99s none of\nmy business. But you seem to be feeling all hunky-dory again, and why\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you come join us in the Good Citizens\xe2\x80\x99 League, old man? We have\nsome corking times together, and we need your advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen did Babbitt, almost tearful with joy at being coaxed instead of\nbullied, at being permitted to stop fighting, at being able to desert\nwithout injuring his opinion of himself, cease utterly to be a domestic\nrevolutionist. He patted Gunch\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and next day he became a\nmember of the Good Citizens\xe2\x80\x99 League.\n\nWithin two weeks no one in the League was more violent regarding the\nwickedness of Seneca Doane, the crimes of labor unions, the perils of\nimmigration, and the delights of golf, morality, and bank-accounts than\nwas George F. Babbitt.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\nI\n\nThe Good Citizens\xe2\x80\x99 League had spread through the country, but nowhere\nwas it so effective and well esteemed as in cities of the type of\nZenith, commercial cities of a few hundred thousand inhabitants, most of\nwhich--though not all--lay inland, against a background of cornfields\nand mines and of small towns which depended upon them for\nmortgage-loans, table-manners, art, social philosophy and millinery.\n\nTo the League belonged most of the prosperous citizens of Zenith. They\nwere not all of the kind who called themselves \xe2\x80\x9cRegular Guys.\xe2\x80\x9d Besides\nthese hearty fellows, these salesmen of prosperity, there were the\naristocrats, that is, the men who were richer or had been rich for more\ngenerations: the presidents of banks and of factories, the land-owners,\nthe corporation lawyers, the fashionable doctors, and the few young-old\nmen who worked not at all but, reluctantly remaining in Zenith,\ncollected luster-ware and first editions as though they were back in\nParis. All of them agreed that the working-classes must be kept in their\nplace; and all of them perceived that American Democracy did not imply\nany equality of wealth, but did demand a wholesome sameness of thought,\ndress, painting, morals, and vocabulary.\n\nIn this they were like the ruling-class of any other country,\nparticularly of Great Britain, but they differed in being more vigorous\nand in actually trying to produce the accepted standards which all\nclasses, everywhere, desire, but usually despair of realizing.\n\nThe longest struggle of the Good Citizens\xe2\x80\x99 League was against the Open\nShop--which was secretly a struggle against all union labor.\nAccompanying it was an Americanization Movement, with evening classes in\nEnglish and history and economics, and daily articles in the newspapers,\nso that newly arrived foreigners might learn that the true-blue and one\nhundred per cent. American way of settling labor-troubles was for\nworkmen to trust and love their employers.\n\nThe League was more than generous in approving other organizations which\nagreed with its aims. It helped the Y.M.C.A. to raise a\ntwo-hundred-thousand-dollar fund for a new building. Babbitt, Vergil\nGunch, Sidney Finkelstein, and even Charles McKelvey told the spectators\nat movie theaters how great an influence for manly Christianity the\n\xe2\x80\x9cgood old Y.\xe2\x80\x9d had been in their own lives; and the hoar and mighty\nColonel Rutherford Snow, owner of the _Advocate-Times_, was photographed\nclasping the hand of Sheldon Smeeth of the Y.M.C.A. It is true that\nafterward, when Smeeth lisped, \xe2\x80\x9cYou must come to one of our\nprayer-meetings,\xe2\x80\x9d the ferocious Colonel bellowed, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the hell would I\ndo that for? I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a bar of my own,\xe2\x80\x9d but this did not appear in the\npublic prints.\n\nThe League was of value to the American Legion at a time when certain of\nthe lesser and looser newspapers were criticizing that organization of\nveterans of the Great War. One evening a number of young men raided the\nZenith Socialist Headquarters, burned its records, beat the office\nstaff, and agreeably dumped desks out of the window. All of the\nnewspapers save the _Advocate-Times_ and the _Evening Advocate_\nattributed this valuable but perhaps hasty direct-action to the American\nLegion. Then a flying squadron from the Good Citizens\xe2\x80\x99 League called on\nthe unfair papers and explained that no ex-soldier could possibly do\nsuch a thing, and the editors saw the light, and retained their\nadvertising. When Zenith\xe2\x80\x99s lone Conscientious Objector came home from\nprison and was righteously run out of town, the newspapers referred to\nthe perpetrators as an \xe2\x80\x9cunidentified mob.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nII\n\nIn all the activities and triumphs of the Good Citizens\xe2\x80\x99 League Babbitt\ntook part, and completely won back to self-respect, placidity, and the\naffection of his friends. But he began to protest, \xe2\x80\x9cGosh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done my\nshare in cleaning up the city. I want to tend to business. Think I\xe2\x80\x99ll\njust kind of slacken up on this G.C.L. stuff now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe had returned to the church as he had returned to the Boosters\xe2\x80\x99 Club.\nHe had even endured the lavish greeting which Sheldon Smeeth gave him.\nHe was worried lest during his late discontent he had imperiled his\nsalvation. He was not quite sure there was a Heaven to be attained, but\nDr. John Jennison Drew said there was, and Babbitt was not going to take\na chance.\n\nOne evening when he was walking past Dr. Drew\xe2\x80\x99s parsonage he impulsively\nwent in and found the pastor in his study.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJus\xe2\x80\x99 minute--getting \xe2\x80\x99phone call,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Drew in business-like\ntones, then, aggressively, to the telephone: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Lo--\xe2\x80\x99lo! This Berkey and\nHannis? Reverend Drew speaking. Where the dickens is the proof for next\nSunday\xe2\x80\x99s calendar? Huh? Y\xe2\x80\x99 ought to have it here. Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it\nif they\xe2\x80\x99re _all_ sick! I got to have it to-night. Get an A.D.T. boy and\nshoot it up here quick.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe turned, without slackening his briskness. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Brother Babbitt,\nwhat c\xe2\x80\x99n I do for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just wanted to ask-- Tell you how it is, dominie: Here a while ago I\nguess I got kind of slack. Took a few drinks and so on. What I wanted to\nask is: How is it if a fellow cuts that all out and comes back to his\nsenses? Does it sort of, well, you might say, does it score against him\nin the long run?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Reverend Dr. Drew was suddenly interested. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, uh, brother--the\nother things, too? Women?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, practically, you might say, practically not at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to tell me, brother! That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m here for. Been\ngoing on joy-rides? Squeezing girls in cars?\xe2\x80\x9d The reverend eyes\nglistened.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--no--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a deputation from the Don\xe2\x80\x99t Make\nProhibition a Joke Association coming to see me in a quarter of an hour,\nand one from the Anti-Birth-Control Union at a quarter of ten.\xe2\x80\x9d He\nbusily glanced at his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I can take five minutes off and pray\nwith you. Kneel right down by your chair, brother. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be ashamed to\nseek the guidance of God.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt\xe2\x80\x99s scalp itched and he longed to flee, but Dr. Drew had already\nflopped down beside his desk-chair and his voice had changed from\nrasping efficiency to an unctuous familiarity with sin and with the\nAlmighty. Babbitt also knelt, while Drew gloated:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Lord, thou seest our brother here, who has been led astray by\nmanifold temptations. O Heavenly Father, make his heart to be pure, as\npure as a little child\xe2\x80\x99s. Oh, let him know again the joy of a manly\ncourage to abstain from evil--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSheldon Smeeth came frolicking into the study. At the sight of the two\nmen he smirked, forgivingly patted Babbitt on the shoulder, and knelt\nbeside him, his arm about him, while he authorized Dr. Drew\xe2\x80\x99s\nimprecations with moans of \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Lord! Help our brother, Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThough he was trying to keep his eyes closed, Babbitt squinted between\nhis fingers and saw the pastor glance at his watch as he concluded with\na triumphant, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd let him never be afraid to come to Us for counsel and\ntender care, and let him know that the church can lead him as a little\nlamb.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDr. Drew sprang up, rolled his eyes in the general direction of Heaven,\nchucked his watch into his pocket, and demanded, \xe2\x80\x9cHas the deputation\ncome yet, Sheldy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYep, right outside,\xe2\x80\x9d Sheldy answered, with equal liveliness; then,\ncaressingly, to Babbitt, \xe2\x80\x9cBrother, if it would help, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to go\ninto the next room and pray with you while Dr. Drew is receiving the\nbrothers from the Don\xe2\x80\x99t Make Prohibition a Joke Association.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--no thanks--can\xe2\x80\x99t take the time!\xe2\x80\x9d yelped Babbitt, rushing toward the\ndoor.\n\nThereafter he was often seen at the Chatham Road Presbyterian Church,\nbut it is recorded that he avoided shaking hands with the pastor at the\ndoor.\n\n\nIII\n\nIf his moral fiber had been so weakened by rebellion that he was not\nquite dependable in the more rigorous campaigns of the Good Citizens\xe2\x80\x99\nLeague nor quite appreciative of the church, yet there was no doubt of\nthe joy with which Babbitt returned to the pleasures of his home and of\nthe Athletic Club, the Boosters, the Elks.\n\nVerona and Kenneth Escott were eventually and hesitatingly married. For\nthe wedding Babbitt was dressed as carefully as was Verona; he was\ncrammed into the morning-coat he wore to teas thrice a year; and with a\ncertain relief, after Verona and Kenneth had driven away in a limousine,\nhe returned to the house, removed the morning coat, sat with his aching\nfeet up on the davenport, and reflected that his wife and he could have\nthe living-room to themselves now, and not have to listen to Verona and\nKenneth worrying, in a cultured collegiate manner, about minimum wages\nand the Drama League.\n\nBut even this sinking into peace was less consoling than his return to\nbeing one of the best-loved men in the Boosters\xe2\x80\x99 Club.\n\n\nIV\n\nPresident Willis Ijams began that Boosters\xe2\x80\x99 Club luncheon by standing\nquiet and staring at them so unhappily that they feared he was about to\nannounce the death of a Brother Booster. He spoke slowly then, and\ngravely:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoys, I have something shocking to reveal to you; something terrible\nabout one of our own members.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSeveral Boosters, including Babbitt, looked disconcerted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA knight of the grip, a trusted friend of mine, recently made a trip\nup-state, and in a certain town, where a certain Booster spent his\nboyhood, he found out something which can no longer be concealed. In\nfact, he discovered the inward nature of a man whom we have accepted as\na Real Guy and as one of us. Gentlemen, I cannot trust my voice to say\nit, so I have written it down.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe uncovered a large blackboard and on it, in huge capitals, was the\nlegend:\n\n               George Follansbee Babbitt--oh you Folly!\n\nThe Boosters cheered, they laughed, they wept, they threw rolls at\nBabbitt, they cried, \xe2\x80\x9cSpeech, speech! Oh you Folly!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPresident Ijams continued:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, gentlemen, is the awful thing Georgie Babbitt has been concealing\nall these years, when we thought he was just plain George F. Now I want\nyou to tell us, taking it in turn, what you\xe2\x80\x99ve always supposed the F.\nstood for.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFlivver, they suggested, and Frog-face and Flathead and Farinaceous and\nFreezone and Flapdoodle and Foghorn. By the joviality of their insults\nBabbitt knew that he had been taken back to their hearts, and happily he\nrose.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoys, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to admit it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never worn a wrist-watch, or parted my\nname in the middle, but I will confess to \xe2\x80\x98Follansbee.\xe2\x80\x99 My only\njustification is that my old dad--though otherwise he was perfectly\nsane, and packed an awful wallop when it came to trimming the City\nFellers at checkers--named me after the family doc, old Dr. Ambrose\nFollansbee. I apologize, boys. In my next what-d\xe2\x80\x99you-call-it I\xe2\x80\x99ll see to\nit that I get named something really practical--something that sounds\nswell and yet is good and virile--something, in fact, like that grand\nold name so familiar to every household--that bold and almost\noverpowering name, Willis Jimjams Ijams!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe knew by the cheer that he was secure again and popular; he knew that\nhe would no more endanger his security and popularity by straying from\nthe Clan of Good Fellows.\n\n\nV\n\nHenry Thompson dashed into the office, clamoring, \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge! Big news!\nJake Offutt says the Traction Bunch are dissatisfied with the way\nSanders, Torrey and Wing handled their last deal, and they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to\ndicker with us!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt was pleased in the realization that the last scar of his\nrebellion was healed, yet as he drove home he was annoyed by such\nbackground thoughts as had never weakened him in his days of belligerent\nconformity. He discovered that he actually did not consider the Traction\ngroup quite honest. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, he\xe2\x80\x99d carry out one more deal for them, but as\nsoon as it was practicable, maybe as soon as old Henry Thompson died,\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d break away from all association from them. He was forty-eight; in\ntwelve years he\xe2\x80\x99d be sixty; he wanted to leave a clean business to his\ngrandchildren. Course there was a lot of money in negotiating for the\nTraction people, and a fellow had to look at things in a practical way,\nonly--\xe2\x80\x9d He wriggled uncomfortably. He wanted to tell the Traction group\nwhat he thought of them. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it, not now. If he offended\nthem this second time, they would crush him. But--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe was conscious that his line of progress seemed confused. He wondered\nwhat he would do with his future. He was still young; was he through\nwith all adventuring? He felt that he had been trapped into the very net\nfrom which he had with such fury escaped and, supremest jest of all,\nbeen made to rejoice in the trapping.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve licked me; licked me to a finish!\xe2\x80\x9d he whimpered.\n\nThe house was peaceful, that evening, and he enjoyed a game of pinochle\nwith his wife. He indignantly told the Tempter that he was content to\ndo things in the good old-fashioned way. The day after, he went to see\nthe purchasing-agent of the Street Traction Company and they made plans\nfor the secret purchase of lots along the Evanston Road. But as he drove\nto his office he struggled, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to run things and figure out\nthings to suit myself--when I retire.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nVI\n\nTed had come down from the University for the week-end. Though he no\nlonger spoke of mechanical engineering and though he was reticent about\nhis opinion of his instructors, he seemed no more reconciled to college,\nand his chief interest was his wireless telephone set.\n\nOn Saturday evening he took Eunice Littlefield to a dance at Devon\nWoods. Babbitt had a glimpse of her, bouncing in the seat of the car,\nbrilliant in a scarlet cloak over a frock of thinnest creamy silk. They\ntwo had not returned when the Babbitts went to bed, at half-past eleven.\nAt a blurred indefinite time of late night Babbitt was awakened by the\nring of the telephone and gloomily crawled down-stairs. Howard\nLittlefield was speaking:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge, Euny isn\xe2\x80\x99t back yet. Is Ted?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--at least his door is open--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey ought to be home. Eunice said the dance would be over at midnight.\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the name of those people where they\xe2\x80\x99re going?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, gosh, tell the truth, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Howard. It\xe2\x80\x99s some classmate of\nTed\xe2\x80\x99s, out in Devon Woods. Don\xe2\x80\x99t see what we can do. Wait, I\xe2\x80\x99ll skip up\nand ask Myra if she knows their name.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBabbitt turned on the light in Ted\xe2\x80\x99s room. It was a brown boyish room;\ndisordered dresser, worn books, a high-school pennant, photographs of\nbasket-ball teams and baseball teams. Ted was decidedly not there.\n\nMrs. Babbitt, awakened, irritably observed that she certainly did not\nknow the name of Ted\xe2\x80\x99s host, that it was late, that Howard Littlefield\nwas but little better than a born fool, and that she was sleepy. But she\nremained awake and worrying while Babbitt, on the sleeping-porch,\nstruggled back into sleep through the incessant soft rain of her\nremarks. It was after dawn when he was aroused by her shaking him and\ncalling \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge! George!\xe2\x80\x9d in something like horror.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWha--wha--what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here quick and see. Be quiet!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe led him down the hall to the door of Ted\xe2\x80\x99s room and pushed it gently\nopen. On the worn brown rug he saw a froth of rose-colored chiffon\nlingerie; on the sedate Morris chair a girl\xe2\x80\x99s silver slipper. And on the\npillows were two sleepy heads--Ted\xe2\x80\x99s and Eunice\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\nTed woke to grin, and to mutter with unconvincing defiance, \xe2\x80\x9cGood\nmorning! Let me introduce my wife--Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt Eunice\nLittlefield Babbitt, Esquiress.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d from Babbitt, and from his wife a long wailing, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve gone\nand--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe got married last evening. Wife! Sit up and say a pretty good morning\nto mother-in-law.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut Eunice hid her shoulders and her charming wild hair under the\npillow.\n\nBy nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock the assembly which was gathered about Ted and Eunice in\nthe living-room included Mr. and Mrs. George Babbitt, Dr. and Mrs.\nHoward Littlefield, Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Escott, Mr. and Mrs. Henry T.\nThompson, and Tinka Babbitt, who was the only pleased member of the\ninquisition.\n\nA crackling shower of phrases filled the room:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt their age--\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOught to be annulled--\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNever heard of such a thing\nin--\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cFault of both of them and--\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cKeep it out of the papers--\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOught\nto be packed off to school--\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDo something about it at once, and what I\nsay is--\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDamn good old-fashioned spanking--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWorst of them all was Verona. \xe2\x80\x9c_Ted!_ Some way _must_ be found to make\nyou under_stand_ how dreadfully _serious_ this is, instead of standing\n_around_ with that silly foolish _smile_ on your face!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe began to revolt. \xe2\x80\x9cGee whittakers, Rone, you got married yourself,\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s entirely different.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet it is! They didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to work on Eu and me with a chain and\ntackle to get us to hold hands!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, young man, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have no more flippancy,\xe2\x80\x9d old Henry Thompson\nordered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou listen to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou listen to Grandfather!\xe2\x80\x9d said Verona.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, listen to your Grandfather!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Babbitt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTed, you listen to Mr. Thompson!\xe2\x80\x9d said Howard Littlefield.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, for the love o\xe2\x80\x99 Mike, I am listening!\xe2\x80\x9d Ted shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you look\nhere, all of you! I\xe2\x80\x99m getting sick and tired of being the corpse in this\npost mortem! If you want to kill somebody, go kill the preacher that\nmarried us! Why, he stung me five dollars, and all the money I had in\nthe world was six dollars and two bits. I\xe2\x80\x99m getting just about enough of\nbeing hollered at!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA new voice, booming, authoritative, dominated the room. It was Babbitt.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYuh, there\xe2\x80\x99s too darn many putting in their oar! Rone, you dry up.\nHoward and I are still pretty strong, and able to do our own cussing.\nTed, come into the dining-room and we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk this over.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the dining-room, the door firmly closed, Babbitt walked to his son,\nput both hands on his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re more or less right. They all\ntalk too much. Now what do you plan to do, old man?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGosh, dad, are you really going to be human?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I-- Remember one time you called us \xe2\x80\x98the Babbitt men\xe2\x80\x99 and said we\nought to stick together? I want to. I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to think this isn\xe2\x80\x99t\nserious. The way the cards are stacked against a young fellow to-day, I\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t say I approve of early marriages. But you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have married a\nbetter girl than Eunice; and way I figure it, Littlefield is darn lucky\nto get a Babbitt for a son-in-law! But what do you plan to do? Course\nyou could go right ahead with the U., and when you\xe2\x80\x99d finished--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDad, I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand it any more. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s all right for some fellows.\nMaybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll want to go back some day. But me, I want to get into\nmechanics. I think I\xe2\x80\x99d get to be a good inventor. There\xe2\x80\x99s a fellow that\nwould give me twenty dollars a week in a factory right now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--\xe2\x80\x9d Babbitt crossed the floor, slowly, ponderously, seeming a\nlittle old. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always wanted you to have a college degree.\xe2\x80\x9d He\nmeditatively stamped across the floor again. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ve never-- Now, for\nheaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, don\xe2\x80\x99t repeat this to your mother, or she\xe2\x80\x99d remove what\nlittle hair I\xe2\x80\x99ve got left, but practically, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never done a single\nthing I\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted to in my whole life! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know \xe2\x80\x99s I\xe2\x80\x99ve accomplished\nanything except just get along. I figure out I\xe2\x80\x99ve made about a quarter\nof an inch out of a possible hundred rods. Well, maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll carry\nthings on further. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. But I do get a kind of sneaking\npleasure out of the fact that you knew what you wanted to do and did it.\nWell, those folks in there will try to bully you, and tame you down.\nTell \xe2\x80\x99em to go to the devil! I\xe2\x80\x99ll back you. Take your factory job, if\nyou want to. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be scared of the family. No, nor all of Zenith. Nor\nof yourself, the way I\xe2\x80\x99ve been. Go ahead, old man! The world is yours!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nArms about each other\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders, the Babbitt men marched into the\nliving-room and faced the swooping family.\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BABBITT ***\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\n\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\'s website\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n'
