I had always thought\r\n         of the lady as Zu-leek-a. Surely it was thus that\r\n         Joseph thought of his Wife, and Selim of his Bride?\r\n         And I do hope that it is thus that any reader of\r\n         these pages will think of Miss Dobson.\r\n\r\n                                              M.B.\r\n                                              Rapallo, 1922.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLI ALMAE MATRI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZULEIKA DOBSON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThat old bell, presage of a train, had just sounded through Oxford\r\nstation; and the undergraduates who were waiting there, gay figures in\r\ntweed or flannel, moved to the margin of the platform and gazed idly\r\nup the line. Young and careless, in the glow of the afternoon sunshine,\r\nthey struck a sharp note of incongruity with the worn boards they stood\r\non, with the fading signals and grey eternal walls of that antique\r\nstation, which, familiar to them and insignificant, does yet whisper to\r\nthe tourist the last enchantments of the Middle Age.\r\n\r\nAt the door of the first-class waiting-room, aloof and venerable, stood\r\nthe Warden of Judas. An ebon pillar of tradition seemed he, in his garb\r\nof old-fashioned cleric. Aloft, between the wide brim of his silk hat\r\nand the white extent of his shirt-front, appeared those eyes which\r\nhawks, that nose which eagles, had often envied. He supported his years\r\non an ebon stick. He alone was worthy of the background.\r\n\r\nCame a whistle from the distance. The breast of an engine was descried,\r\nand a long train curving after it, under a flight of smoke. It grew\r\nand grew. Louder and louder, its noise foreran it. It became a furious,\r\nenormous monster, and, with an instinct for safety, all men receded\r\nfrom the platform\xe2\x80\x99s margin. (Yet came there with it, unknown to them,\r\na danger far more terrible than itself.) Into the station it came\r\nblustering, with cloud and clangour. Ere it had yet stopped, the door of\r\none carriage flew open, and from it, in a white travelling dress, in a\r\ntoque a-twinkle with fine diamonds, a lithe and radiant creature slipped\r\nnimbly down to the platform.\r\n\r\nA cynosure indeed! A hundred eyes were fixed on her, and half as many\r\nhearts lost to her. The Warden of Judas himself had mounted on his nose\r\na pair of black-rimmed glasses. Him espying, the nymph darted in his\r\ndirection. The throng made way for her. She was at his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrandpapa!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, and kissed the old man on either cheek. (Not a\r\nyouth there but would have bartered fifty years of his future for that\r\nsalute.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Zuleika,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwelcome to Oxford! Have you no luggage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaps!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd a maid who will find it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Warden, \xe2\x80\x9clet us drive straight to College.\xe2\x80\x9d He offered\r\nher his arm, and they proceeded slowly to the entrance. She chatted\r\ngaily, blushing not in the long avenue of eyes she passed through. All\r\nthe youths, under her spell, were now quite oblivious of the relatives\r\nthey had come to meet. Parents, sisters, cousins, ran unclaimed about\r\nthe platform. Undutiful, all the youths were forming a serried suite to\r\ntheir enchantress. In silence they followed her. They saw her leap into\r\nthe Warden\xe2\x80\x99s landau, they saw the Warden seat himself upon her left. Nor\r\nwas it until the landau was lost to sight that they turned--how slowly,\r\nand with how bad a grace!--to look for their relatives.\r\n\r\nThrough those slums which connect Oxford with the world, the landau\r\nrolled on towards Judas. Not many youths occurred, for nearly all--it\r\nwas the Monday of Eights Week--were down by the river, cheering the\r\ncrews. There did, however, come spurring by, on a polo-pony, a very\r\nsplendid youth. His straw hat was encircled with a riband of blue and\r\nwhite, and he raised it to the Warden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Warden, \xe2\x80\x9cis the Duke of Dorset, a member of my College.\r\nHe dines at my table to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZuleika, turning to regard his Grace, saw that he had not reined in and\r\nwas not even glancing back at her over his shoulder. She gave a little\r\nstart of dismay, but scarcely had her lips pouted ere they curved to a\r\nsmile--a smile with no malice in its corners.\r\n\r\nAs the landau rolled into \xe2\x80\x9cthe Corn,\xe2\x80\x9d another youth--a pedestrian, and\r\nvery different--saluted the Warden. He wore a black jacket, rusty and\r\namorphous. His trousers were too short, and he himself was too short:\r\nalmost a dwarf. His face was as plain as his gait was undistinguished.\r\nHe squinted behind spectacles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who is that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Zuleika.\r\n\r\nA deep flush overspread the cheek of the Warden. \xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nalso a member of Judas. His name, I believe, is Noaks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he dining with us to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Zuleika.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Warden. \xe2\x80\x9cMost decidedly not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoaks, unlike the Duke, had stopped for an ardent retrospect. He gazed\r\ntill the landau was out of his short sight; then, sighing, resumed his\r\nsolitary walk.\r\n\r\nThe landau was rolling into \xe2\x80\x9cthe Broad,\xe2\x80\x9d over that ground which had once\r\nblackened under the fagots lit for Latimer and Ridley. It rolled past\r\nthe portals of Balliol and of Trinity, past the Ashmolean. From those\r\npedestals which intersperse the railing of the Sheldonian, the high\r\ngrim busts of the Roman Emperors stared down at the fair stranger in\r\nthe equipage. Zuleika returned their stare with but a casual glance. The\r\ninanimate had little charm for her.\r\n\r\nA moment later, a certain old don emerged from Blackwell\xe2\x80\x99s, where he had\r\nbeen buying books. Looking across the road, he saw, to his amazement,\r\ngreat beads of perspiration glistening on the brows of those Emperors.\r\nHe trembled, and hurried away. That evening, in Common Room, he told\r\nwhat he had seen; and no amount of polite scepticism would convince him\r\nthat it was but the hallucination of one who had been reading too much\r\nMommsen. He persisted that he had seen what he described. It was not\r\nuntil two days had elapsed that some credence was accorded him.\r\n\r\nYes, as the landau rolled by, sweat started from the brows of the\r\nEmperors. They, at least, foresaw the peril that was overhanging Oxford,\r\nand they gave such warning as they could. Let that be remembered to\r\ntheir credit. Let that incline us to think more gently of them. In their\r\nlives we know, they were infamous, some of them--\xe2\x80\x9cnihil non commiserunt\r\nstupri, saevitiae, impietatis.\xe2\x80\x9d But are they too little punished, after\r\nall? Here in Oxford, exposed eternally and inexorably to heat and frost,\r\nto the four winds that lash them and the rains that wear them away, they\r\nare expiating, in effigy, the abominations of their pride and cruelty\r\nand lust. Who were lechers, they are without bodies; who were tyrants,\r\nthey are crowned never but with crowns of snow; who made themselves even\r\nwith the gods, they are by American visitors frequently mistaken for\r\nthe Twelve Apostles. It is but a little way down the road that the two\r\nBishops perished for their faith, and even now we do never pass the spot\r\nwithout a tear for them. Yet how quickly they died in the flames! To\r\nthese Emperors, for whom none weeps, time will give no surcease. Surely,\r\nit is sign of some grace in them that they rejoiced not, this bright\r\nafternoon, in the evil that was to befall the city of their penance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe sun streamed through the bay-window of a \xe2\x80\x9cbest\xe2\x80\x9d bedroom in the\r\nWarden\xe2\x80\x99s house, and glorified the pale crayon-portraits on the wall,\r\nthe dimity curtains, the old fresh chintz. He invaded the many trunks\r\nwhich--all painted Z. D.--gaped, in various stages of excavation, around\r\nthe room. The doors of the huge wardrobe stood, like the doors of\r\nJanus\xe2\x80\x99 temple in time of war, majestically open; and the sun seized this\r\nopportunity of exploring the mahogany recesses. But the carpet, which\r\nhad faded under his immemorial visitations, was now almost ENTIRELY\r\nhidden from him, hidden under layers of fair fine linen, layers of\r\nsilk, brocade, satin, chiffon, muslin. All the colours of the rainbow,\r\nmaterialised by modistes, were there. Stacked on chairs were I know not\r\nwhat of sachets, glove-cases, fan-cases. There were innumerable packages\r\nin silver-paper and pink ribands. There was a pyramid of bandboxes.\r\nThere was a virgin forest of boot-trees. And rustling quickly hither and\r\nthither, in and out of this profusion, with armfuls of finery, was an\r\nobviously French maid. Alert, unerring, like a swallow she dipped and\r\ndarted. Nothing escaped her, and she never rested. She had the air of\r\nthe born unpacker--swift and firm, yet withal tender. Scarce had her\r\narms been laden but their loads were lying lightly between shelves or\r\ntightly in drawers. To calculate, catch, distribute, seemed in her but a\r\nsingle process. She was one of those who are born to make chaos cosmic.\r\n\r\nInsomuch that ere the loud chapel-clock tolled another hour all the\r\ntrunks had been sent empty away. The carpet was unflecked by any scrap\r\nof silver-paper. From the mantelpiece, photographs of Zuleika surveyed\r\nthe room with a possessive air. Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s pincushion, a-bristle with\r\nnew pins, lay on the dimity-flounced toilet-table, and round it stood\r\na multitude of multiform glass vessels, domed, all of them, with dull\r\ngold, on which Z. D., in zianites and diamonds, was encrusted. On\r\na small table stood a great casket of malachite, initialled in like\r\nfashion. On another small table stood Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s library. Both books were\r\nin covers of dull gold. On the back of one cover BRADSHAW, in beryls,\r\nwas encrusted; on the back of the other, A.B.C. GUIDE, in amethysts,\r\nberyls, chrysoprases, and garnets. And Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s great cheval-glass\r\nstood ready to reflect her. Always it travelled with her, in a great\r\ncase specially made for it. It was framed in ivory, and of fluted ivory\r\nwere the slim columns it swung between. Of gold were its twin sconces,\r\nand four tall tapers stood in each of them.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and the Warden, with hospitable words, left his\r\ngrand-daughter at the threshold.\r\n\r\nZuleika wandered to her mirror. \xe2\x80\x9cUndress me, Melisande,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Like\r\nall who are wont to appear by night before the public, she had the habit\r\nof resting towards sunset.\r\n\r\nPresently Melisande withdrew. Her mistress, in a white peignoir tied\r\nwith a blue sash, lay in a great chintz chair, gazing out of the\r\nbay-window. The quadrangle below was very beautiful, with its walls of\r\nrugged grey, its cloisters, its grass carpet. But to her it was of no\r\nmore interest than if it had been the rattling court-yard to one of\r\nthose hotels in which she spent her life. She saw it, but heeded it not.\r\nShe seemed to be thinking of herself, or of something she desired, or of\r\nsome one she had never met. There was ennui, and there was wistfulness,\r\nin her gaze. Yet one would have guessed these things to be transient--to\r\nbe no more than the little shadows that sometimes pass between a bright\r\nmirror and the brightness it reflects.\r\n\r\nZuleika was not strictly beautiful. Her eyes were a trifle large, and\r\ntheir lashes longer than they need have been. An anarchy of small curls\r\nwas her chevelure, a dark upland of misrule, every hair asserting its\r\nrights over a not discreditable brow. For the rest, her features were\r\nnot at all original. They seemed to have been derived rather from a\r\ngallimaufry of familiar models. From Madame la Marquise de Saint-Ouen\r\ncame the shapely tilt of the nose. The mouth was a mere replica of\r\nCupid\xe2\x80\x99s bow, lacquered scarlet and strung with the littlest pearls.\r\nNo apple-tree, no wall of peaches, had not been robbed, nor any Tyrian\r\nrose-garden, for the glory of Miss Dobson\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks. Her neck was\r\nimitation-marble. Her hands and feet were of very mean proportions. She\r\nhad no waist to speak of.\r\n\r\nYet, though a Greek would have railed at her asymmetry, and an\r\nElizabethan have called her \xe2\x80\x9cgipsy,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Dobson now, in the midst of\r\nthe Edwardian Era, was the toast of two hemispheres. Late in her \xe2\x80\x98teens\r\nshe had become an orphan and a governess. Her grandfather had refused\r\nher appeal for a home or an allowance, on the ground that he would not\r\nbe burdened with the upshot of a marriage which he had once forbidden\r\nand not yet forgiven. Lately, however, prompted by curiosity or by\r\nremorse, he had asked her to spend a week or so of his declining\r\nyears with him. And she, \xe2\x80\x9cresting\xe2\x80\x9d between two engagements--one at\r\nHammerstein\xe2\x80\x99s Victoria, N.Y.C., the other at the Folies Bergeres,\r\nParis--and having never been in Oxford, had so far let bygones be\r\nbygones as to come and gratify the old man\xe2\x80\x99s whim.\r\n\r\nIt may be that she still resented his indifference to those early\r\nstruggles which, even now, she shuddered to recall. For a governess\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlife she had been, indeed, notably unfit. Hard she had thought it, that\r\npenury should force her back into the school-room she was scarce out of,\r\nthere to champion the sums and maps and conjugations she had never\r\ntried to master. Hating her work, she had failed signally to pick up\r\nany learning from her little pupils, and had been driven from house\r\nto house, a sullen and most ineffectual maiden. The sequence of her\r\nsituations was the swifter by reason of her pretty face. Was there a\r\ngrown-up son, always he fell in love with her, and she would let his\r\neyes trifle boldly with hers across the dinner-table. When he offered\r\nher his hand, she would refuse it--not because she \xe2\x80\x9cknew her place,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n but because she did not love him. Even had she been a good teacher, her\r\npresence could not have been tolerated thereafter. Her corded trunk,\r\nheavier by another packet of billets-doux and a month\xe2\x80\x99s salary in\r\nadvance, was soon carried up the stairs of some other house.\r\n\r\nIt chanced that she came, at length, to be governess in a large family\r\nthat had Gibbs for its name and Notting Hill for its background. Edward,\r\nthe eldest son, was a clerk in the city, who spent his evenings in the\r\npractice of amateur conjuring. He was a freckled youth, with hair that\r\nbristled in places where it should have lain smooth, and he fell in love\r\nwith Zuleika duly, at first sight, during high-tea. In the course of the\r\nevening, he sought to win her admiration by a display of all his tricks.\r\nThese were familiar to this household, and the children had been sent\r\nto bed, the mother was dozing, long before the seance was at an end. But\r\nMiss Dobson, unaccustomed to any gaieties, sat fascinated by the young\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s sleight of hand, marvelling that a top-hat could hold so many\r\ngoldfish, and a handkerchief turn so swiftly into a silver florin. All\r\nthat night, she lay wide awake, haunted by the miracles he had wrought.\r\nNext evening, when she asked him to repeat them, \xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot bear to deceive the girl I love. Permit me to explain the\r\ntricks.\xe2\x80\x9d So he explained them. His eyes sought hers across the bowl of\r\ngold-fish, his fingers trembled as he taught her to manipulate the magic\r\ncanister. One by one, she mastered the paltry secrets. Her respect for\r\nhim waned with every revelation. He complimented her on her skill. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncould not do it more neatly myself!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear Miss Dobson,\r\nwill you but accept my hand, all these things shall be yours--the cards,\r\nthe canister, the goldfish, the demon egg-cup--all yours!\xe2\x80\x9d Zuleika,\r\nwith ravishing coyness, answered that if he would give her them now, she\r\nwould \xe2\x80\x9cthink it over.\xe2\x80\x9d The swain consented, and at bed-time she\r\nretired with the gift under her arm. In the light of her bedroom candle\r\nMarguerite hung not in greater ecstasy over the jewel-casket than\r\nhung Zuleika over the box of tricks. She clasped her hands over the\r\ntremendous possibilities it held for her--manumission from her bondage,\r\nwealth, fame, power. Stealthily, so soon as the house slumbered,\r\nshe packed her small outfit, embedding therein the precious gift.\r\nNoiselessly, she shut the lid of her trunk, corded it, shouldered it,\r\nstole down the stairs with it. Outside--how that chain had grated!\r\nand her shoulder, how it was aching!--she soon found a cab. She took\r\na night\xe2\x80\x99s sanctuary in some railway-hotel. Next day, she moved into\r\na small room in a lodging-house off the Edgware Road, and there for\r\na whole week she was sedulous in the practice of her tricks. Then she\r\ninscribed her name on the books of a \xe2\x80\x9cJuvenile Party Entertainments\r\nAgency.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Christmas holidays were at hand, and before long she got an\r\nengagement. It was a great evening for her. Her repertory was, it must\r\nbe confessed, old and obvious; but the children, in deference to their\r\nhostess, pretended not to know how the tricks were done, and assumed\r\ntheir prettiest airs of wonder and delight. One of them even pretended\r\nto be frightened, and was led howling from the room. In fact, the whole\r\nthing went off splendidly. The hostess was charmed, and told Zuleika\r\nthat a glass of lemonade would be served to her in the hall. Other\r\nengagements soon followed. Zuleika was very, very happy. I cannot claim\r\nfor her that she had a genuine passion for her art. The true conjurer\r\nfinds his guerdon in the consciousness of work done perfectly and for\r\nits own sake. Lucre and applause are not necessary to him. If he were\r\nset down, with the materials of his art, on a desert island, he would\r\nyet be quite happy. He would not cease to produce the barber\xe2\x80\x99s-pole from\r\nhis mouth. To the indifferent winds he would still speak his patter, and\r\neven in the last throes of starvation would not eat his live rabbit or\r\nhis gold-fish. Zuleika, on a desert island, would have spent most of her\r\ntime in looking for a man\xe2\x80\x99s foot-print. She was, indeed, far too human\r\na creature to care much for art. I do not say that she took her work\r\nlightly. She thought she had genius, and she liked to be told that this\r\nwas so. But mainly she loved her work as a means of mere self-display.\r\nThe frank admiration which, into whatsoever house she entered, the\r\ngrown-up sons flashed on her; their eagerness to see her to the door;\r\ntheir impressive way of putting her into her omnibus--these were the\r\nthings she revelled in. She was a nymph to whom men\xe2\x80\x99s admiration was the\r\ngreater part of life. By day, whenever she went into the streets,\r\nshe was conscious that no man passed her without a stare; and this\r\nconsciousness gave a sharp zest to her outings. Sometimes she was\r\nfollowed to her door--crude flattery which she was too innocent to fear.\r\nEven when she went into the haberdasher\xe2\x80\x99s to make some little purchase\r\nof tape or riband, or into the grocer\xe2\x80\x99s--for she was an epicure in her\r\nhumble way--to buy a tin of potted meat for her supper, the homage of\r\nthe young men behind the counter did flatter and exhilarate her. As the\r\nhomage of men became for her, more and more, a matter of course, the\r\nmore subtly necessary was it to her happiness. The more she won of it,\r\nthe more she treasured it. She was alone in the world, and it saved her\r\nfrom any moment of regret that she had neither home nor friends. For\r\nher the streets that lay around her had no squalor, since she paced them\r\nalways in the gold nimbus of her fascinations. Her bedroom seemed not\r\nmean nor lonely to her, since the little square of glass, nailed above\r\nthe wash-stand, was ever there to reflect her face. Thereinto, indeed,\r\nshe was ever peering. She would droop her head from side to side, she\r\nwould bend it forward and see herself from beneath her eyelashes, then\r\ntilt it back and watch herself over her supercilious chin. And she would\r\nsmile, frown, pout, languish--let all the emotions hover upon her face;\r\nand always she seemed to herself lovelier than she had ever been.\r\n\r\nYet was there nothing Narcissine in her spirit. Her love for her own\r\nimage was not cold aestheticism. She valued that image not for its own\r\nsake, but for sake of the glory it always won for her. In the little\r\nremote music-hall, where she was soon appearing nightly as an \xe2\x80\x9cearly\r\nturn,\xe2\x80\x9d she reaped glory in a nightly harvest. She could feel that all\r\nthe gallery-boys, because of her, were scornful of the sweethearts\r\nwedged between them, and she knew that she had but to say \xe2\x80\x9cWill any\r\ngentleman in the audience be so good as to lend me his hat?\xe2\x80\x9d for the\r\nstalls to rise as one man and rush towards the platform. But greater\r\nthings were in store for her. She was engaged at two halls in the West\r\nEnd. Her horizon was fast receding and expanding. Homage became nightly\r\ntangible in bouquets, rings, brooches--things acceptable and (luckier\r\nthan their donors) accepted. Even Sunday was not barren for Zuleika:\r\nmodish hostesses gave her postprandially to their guests. Came that\r\nSunday night, notanda candidissimo calculo! when she received certain\r\nguttural compliments which made absolute her vogue and enabled her to\r\ncommand, thenceforth, whatever terms she asked for.\r\n\r\nAlready, indeed, she was rich. She was living at the most exorbitant\r\nhotel in all Mayfair. She had innumerable gowns and no necessity to buy\r\njewels; and she also had, which pleased her most, the fine cheval-glass\r\nI have described. At the close of the Season, Paris claimed her for\r\na month\xe2\x80\x99s engagement. Paris saw her and was prostrate. Boldini did a\r\nportrait of her. Jules Bloch wrote a song about her; and this, for a\r\nwhole month, was howled up and down the cobbled alleys of Montmartre.\r\nAnd all the little dandies were mad for \xe2\x80\x9cla Zuleika.\xe2\x80\x9d The jewellers\r\nof the Rue de la Paix soon had nothing left to put in their\r\nwindows--everything had been bought for \xe2\x80\x9cla Zuleika.\xe2\x80\x9d For a whole month,\r\nbaccarat was not played at the Jockey Club--every member had succumbed\r\nto a nobler passion. For a whole month, the whole demi-monde was\r\nforgotten for one English virgin. Never, even in Paris, had a woman\r\ntriumphed so. When the day came for her departure, the city wore such an\r\nair of sullen mourning as it had not worn since the Prussians marched to\r\nits Elysee. Zuleika, quite untouched, would not linger in the conquered\r\ncity. Agents had come to her from every capital in Europe, and, for a\r\nyear, she ranged, in triumphal nomady, from one capital to another. In\r\nBerlin, every night, the students escorted her home with torches. Prince\r\nVierfuenfsechs-Siebenachtneun offered her his hand, and was condemned\r\nby the Kaiser to six months\xe2\x80\x99 confinement in his little castle. In Yildiz\r\nKiosk, the tyrant who still throve there conferred on her the Order of\r\nChastity, and offered her the central couch in his seraglio. She\r\ngave her performance in the Quirinal, and, from the Vatican, the Pope\r\nlaunched against her a Bull which fell utterly flat. In Petersburg, the\r\nGrand Duke Salamander Salamandrovitch fell enamoured of her. Of every\r\narticle in the apparatus of her conjuring-tricks he caused a replica\r\nto be made in finest gold. These treasures he presented to her in that\r\ngreat malachite casket which now stood on the little table in her room;\r\nand thenceforth it was with these that she performed her wonders.\r\nThey did not mark the limit of the Grand Duke\xe2\x80\x99s generosity. He was for\r\nbestowing on Zuleika the half of his immensurable estates. The Grand\r\nDuchess appealed to the Tzar. Zuleika was conducted across the frontier,\r\nby an escort of love-sick Cossacks. On the Sunday before she left\r\nMadrid, a great bull-fight was held in her honour. Fifteen bulls\r\nreceived the coup-de-grace, and Alvarez, the matador of matadors, died\r\nin the arena with her name on his lips. He had tried to kill the\r\nlast bull without taking his eyes off la divina senorita. A prettier\r\ncompliment had never been paid her, and she was immensely pleased with\r\nit. For that matter, she was immensely pleased with everything. She\r\nmoved proudly to the incessant music of a paean, aye! of a paean that\r\nwas always crescendo.\r\n\r\nIts echoes followed her when she crossed the Atlantic, till they were\r\nlost in the louder, deeper, more blatant paean that rose for her from\r\nthe shores beyond. All the stops of that \xe2\x80\x9cmighty organ, many-piped,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nNew York press, were pulled out simultaneously, as far as they could be\r\npulled, in Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s honour. She delighted in the din. She read every\r\nline that was printed about her, tasting her triumph as she had never\r\ntasted it before. And how she revelled in the Brobdingnagian drawings of\r\nher, which, printed in nineteen colours, towered between the columns or\r\nsprawled across them! There she was, measuring herself back to back with\r\nthe Statue of Liberty; scudding through the firmament on a comet,\r\nwhilst a crowd of tiny men in evening-dress stared up at her from the\r\nterrestrial globe; peering through a microscope held by Cupid over a\r\ndiminutive Uncle Sam; teaching the American Eagle to stand on its head;\r\nand doing a hundred-and-one other things--whatever suggested itself\r\nto the fancy of native art. And through all this iridescent maze of\r\nsymbolism were scattered many little slabs of realism. At home, on the\r\nstreet, Zuleika was the smiling target of all snap-shooters, and all the\r\nsnap-shots were snapped up by the press and reproduced with annotations:\r\nZuleika Dobson walking on Broadway in the sables gifted her by Grand\r\nDuke Salamander--she says \xe2\x80\x9cYou can bounce blizzards in them\xe2\x80\x9d; Zuleika\r\nDobson yawning over a love-letter from millionaire Edelweiss; relishing\r\na cup of clam-broth--she says \xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t use clams out there\xe2\x80\x9d; ordering\r\nher maid to fix her a warm bath; finding a split in the gloves she has\r\njust drawn on before starting for the musicale given in her honour by\r\nMrs. Suetonius X. Meistersinger, the most exclusive woman in New York;\r\nchatting at the telephone to Miss Camille Van Spook, the best-born girl\r\nin New York; laughing over the recollection of a compliment made her by\r\nGeorge Abimelech Post, the best-groomed man in New York; meditating a\r\nnew trick; admonishing a waiter who has upset a cocktail over her skirt;\r\nhaving herself manicured; drinking tea in bed. Thus was Zuleika enabled\r\ndaily to be, as one might say, a spectator of her own wonderful life.\r\nOn her departure from New York, the papers spoke no more than the\r\ntruth when they said she had had \xe2\x80\x9ca lovely time.\xe2\x80\x9d The further she went\r\nWest--millionaire Edelweiss had loaned her his private car--the lovelier\r\nher time was. Chicago drowned the echoes of New York; final Frisco\r\ndwarfed the headlines of Chicago. Like one of its own prairie-fires, she\r\nswept the country from end to end. Then she swept back, and sailed for\r\nEngland. She was to return for a second season in the coming Fall. At\r\npresent, she was, as I have said, \xe2\x80\x9cresting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she sat here in the bay-window of her room, she was not reviewing\r\nthe splendid pageant of her past. She was a young person whose reveries\r\nnever were in retrospect. For her the past was no treasury of distinct\r\nmemories, all hoarded and classified, some brighter than others and more\r\nhighly valued. All memories were for her but as the motes in one fused\r\nradiance that followed her and made more luminous the pathway of\r\nher future. She was always looking forward. She was looking forward\r\nnow--that shade of ennui had passed from her face--to the week she was\r\nto spend in Oxford. A new city was a new toy to her, and--for it was\r\nyouth\xe2\x80\x99s homage that she loved best--this city of youths was a toy after\r\nher own heart.\r\n\r\nAye, and it was youths who gave homage to her most freely. She was\r\nof that high-stepping and flamboyant type that captivates youth most\r\nsurely. Old men and men of middle age admired her, but she had not that\r\nflower-like quality of shyness and helplessness, that look of innocence,\r\nso dear to men who carry life\xe2\x80\x99s secrets in their heads. Yet Zuleika\r\nWAS very innocent, really. She was as pure as that young shepherdess\r\nMarcella, who, all unguarded, roved the mountains and was by all the\r\nshepherds adored. Like Marcella, she had given her heart to no man, had\r\npreferred none. Youths were reputed to have died for love of her,\r\nas Chrysostom died for love of the shepherdess; and she, like the\r\nshepherdess, had shed no tear. When Chrysostom was lying on his bier in\r\nthe valley, and Marcella looked down from the high rock, Ambrosio,\r\nthe dead man\xe2\x80\x99s comrade, cried out on her, upbraiding her with bitter\r\nwords--\xe2\x80\x9cOh basilisk of our mountains!\xe2\x80\x9d Nor do I think Ambrosio spoke too\r\nstrongly. Marcella cared nothing for men\xe2\x80\x99s admiration, and yet, instead\r\nof retiring to one of those nunneries which are founded for her kind,\r\nshe chose to rove the mountains, causing despair to all the shepherds.\r\nZuleika, with her peculiar temperament, would have gone mad in a\r\nnunnery. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d you may argue, \xe2\x80\x9cought not she to have taken the veil,\r\neven at the cost of her reason, rather than cause so much despair in the\r\nworld? If Marcella was a basilisk, as you seem to think, how about Miss\r\nDobson?\xe2\x80\x9d Ah, but Marcella knew quite well, boasted even, that she never\r\nwould or could love any man. Zuleika, on the other hand, was a woman of\r\nreally passionate fibre. She may not have had that conscious, separate,\r\nand quite explicit desire to be a mother with which modern playwrights\r\ncredit every unmated member of her sex. But she did know that she could\r\nlove. And, surely, no woman who knows that of herself can be rightly\r\ncensured for not recluding herself from the world: it is only women\r\nwithout the power to love who have no right to provoke men\xe2\x80\x99s love.\r\n\r\nThough Zuleika had never given her heart, strong in her were the desire\r\nand the need that it should be given. Whithersoever she had fared, she\r\nhad seen nothing but youths fatuously prostrate to her--not one upright\r\nfigure which she could respect. There were the middle-aged men, the old\r\nmen, who did not bow down to her; but from middle-age, as from eld, she\r\nhad a sanguine aversion. She could love none but a youth. Nor--though\r\nshe herself, womanly, would utterly abase herself before her\r\nideal--could she love one who fell prone before her. And before her all\r\nyouths always did fall prone. She was an empress, and all youths were\r\nher slaves. Their bondage delighted her, as I have said. But no empress\r\nwho has any pride can adore one of her slaves. Whom, then, could proud\r\nZuleika adore? It was a question which sometimes troubled her. There\r\nwere even moments when, looking into her cheval-glass, she cried out\r\nagainst that arrangement in comely lines and tints which got for her\r\nthe dulia she delighted in. To be able to love once--would not that be\r\nbetter than all the homage in the world? But would she ever meet whom,\r\nlooking up to him, she could love--she, the omnisubjugant? Would she\r\never, ever meet him?\r\n\r\nIt was when she wondered thus, that the wistfulness came into her eyes.\r\nEven now, as she sat by the window, that shadow returned to them. She\r\nwas wondering, shyly, had she met him at length? That young equestrian\r\nwho had not turned to look at her; whom she was to meet at dinner\r\nto-night... was it he? The ends of her blue sash lay across her lap,\r\nand she was lazily unravelling their fringes. \xe2\x80\x9cBlue and white!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nremembered. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were the colours he wore round his hat.\xe2\x80\x9d And she gave\r\na little laugh of coquetry. She laughed, and, long after, her lips were\r\nstill parted in a smile.\r\n\r\nSo did she sit, smiling, wondering, with the fringes of her sash\r\nbetween her fingers, while the sun sank behind the opposite wall of the\r\nquadrangle, and the shadows crept out across the grass, thirsty for the\r\ndew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe clock in the Warden\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room had just struck eight, and\r\nalready the ducal feet were beautiful on the white bearskin hearthrug.\r\nSo slim and long were they, of instep so nobly arched, that only with\r\na pair of glazed ox-tongues on a breakfast-table were they comparable.\r\nIncomparable quite, the figure and face and vesture of him who ended in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe Warden was talking to him, with all the deference of elderly\r\ncommoner to patrician boy. The other guests--an Oriel don and his\r\nwife--were listening with earnest smile and submissive droop, at a\r\nslight distance. Now and again, to put themselves at their ease, they\r\nexchanged in undertone a word or two about the weather.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe young lady whom you may have noticed with me,\xe2\x80\x9d the Warden was\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cis my orphaned grand-daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d (The wife of the Oriel don\r\ndiscarded her smile, and sighed, with a glance at the Duke, who was\r\nhimself an orphan.) \xe2\x80\x9cShe has come to stay with me.\xe2\x80\x9d (The Duke glanced\r\nquickly round the room.) \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot think why she is not down yet.\xe2\x80\x9d (The\r\nOriel don fixed his eyes on the clock, as though he suspected it of\r\nbeing fast.) \xe2\x80\x9cI must ask you to forgive her. She appears to be a bright,\r\npleasant young woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarried?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Duke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Warden; and a cloud of annoyance crossed the boy\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; she devotes her life entirely to good works.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA hospital nurse?\xe2\x80\x9d the Duke murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s appointed task is to induce delightful wonder rather than\r\nto alleviate pain. She performs conjuring-tricks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot--not Miss Zuleika Dobson?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Duke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh yes. I forgot that she had achieved some fame in the outer world.\r\nPerhaps she has already met you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man coldly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut of course I have heard of Miss\r\nDobson. I did not know she was related to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke had an intense horror of unmarried girls. All his vacations\r\nwere spent in eluding them and their chaperons. That he should be\r\nconfronted with one of them--with such an one of them!--in Oxford,\r\nseemed to him sheer violation of sanctuary. The tone, therefore, in\r\nwhich he said \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be charmed,\xe2\x80\x9d in answer to the Warden\xe2\x80\x99s request\r\nthat he would take Zuleika into dinner, was very glacial. So was his\r\ngaze when, a moment later, the young lady made her entry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe did not look like an orphan,\xe2\x80\x9d said the wife of the Oriel don,\r\nsubsequently, on the way home. The criticism was a just one. Zuleika\r\nwould have looked singular in one of those lowly double-files of\r\nstraw-bonnets and drab cloaks which are so steadying a feature of\r\nour social system. Tall and lissom, she was sheathed from the bosom\r\ndownwards in flamingo silk, and she was liberally festooned with\r\nemeralds. Her dark hair was not even strained back from her forehead and\r\nbehind her ears, as an orphan\xe2\x80\x99s should be. Parted somewhere at the side,\r\nit fell in an avalanche of curls upon one eyebrow. From her right\r\near drooped heavily a black pearl, from her left a pink; and their\r\ndifference gave an odd, bewildering witchery to the little face between.\r\n\r\nWas the young Duke bewitched? Instantly, utterly. But none could\r\nhave guessed as much from his cold stare, his easy and impassive bow.\r\nThroughout dinner, none guessed that his shirt-front was but the screen\r\nof a fierce warfare waged between pride and passion. Zuleika, at the\r\nfoot of the table, fondly supposed him indifferent to her. Though he\r\nsat on her right, not one word or glance would he give her. All his\r\nconversation was addressed to the unassuming lady who sat on his other\r\nside, next to the Warden. Her he edified and flustered beyond measure\r\nby his insistent courtesy. Her husband, alone on the other side of\r\nthe table, was mortified by his utter failure to engage Zuleika in\r\nsmall-talk. Zuleika was sitting with her profile turned to him--the\r\nprofile with the pink pearl--and was gazing full at the young Duke. She\r\nwas hardly more affable than a cameo. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n were the only answers she would vouchsafe to his questions. A vague \xe2\x80\x9cOh\r\nreally?\xe2\x80\x9d was all he got for his timid little offerings of information.\r\nIn vain he started the topic of modern conjuring-tricks as compared with\r\nthe conjuring-tricks performed by the ancient Egyptians. Zuleika did not\r\neven say \xe2\x80\x9cOh really?\xe2\x80\x9d when he told her about the metamorphosis of the\r\nbulls in the Temple of Osiris. He primed himself with a glass of sherry,\r\ncleared his throat. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with a note of firmness, \xe2\x80\x9cdid\r\nyou think of our cousins across the water?\xe2\x80\x9d Zuleika said \xe2\x80\x9cYes;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthen he gave in. Nor was she conscious that he ceased talking to her. At\r\nintervals throughout the rest of dinner, she murmured \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and \xe2\x80\x9cOh really?\xe2\x80\x9d though the poor little don was now listening silently\r\nto the Duke and the Warden.\r\n\r\nShe was in a trance of sheer happiness. At last, she thought, her hope\r\nwas fulfilled--that hope which, although she had seldom remembered it in\r\nthe joy of her constant triumphs, had been always lurking in her, lying\r\nnear to her heart and chafing her, like the shift of sackcloth which\r\nthat young brilliant girl, loved and lost of Giacopone di Todi, wore\r\nalways in secret submission to her own soul, under the fair soft robes\r\nand the rubies men saw on her. At last, here was the youth who would not\r\nbow down to her; whom, looking up to him, she could adore. She ate and\r\ndrank automatically, never taking her gaze from him. She felt not one\r\ntouch of pique at his behaviour. She was tremulous with a joy that was\r\nnew to her, greater than any joy she had known. Her soul was as a flower\r\nin its opetide. She was in love. Rapt, she studied every lineament of\r\nthe pale and perfect face--the brow from which bronze-coloured hair rose\r\nin tiers of burnished ripples; the large steel-coloured eyes, with their\r\ncarven lids; the carven nose, and the plastic lips. She noted how long\r\nand slim were his fingers, and how slender his wrists. She noted the\r\nglint cast by the candles upon his shirt-front. The two large white\r\npearls there seemed to her symbols of his nature. They were like two\r\nmoons: cold, remote, radiant. Even when she gazed at the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s face,\r\nshe was aware of them in her vision.\r\n\r\nNor was the Duke unconscious, as he seemed to be, of her scrutiny.\r\nThough he kept his head averse, he knew that always her eyes were\r\nwatching him. Obliquely, he saw them; saw, too, the contour of the face,\r\nand the black pearl and the pink; could not blind himself, try as he\r\nwould. And he knew that he was in love.\r\n\r\nLike Zuleika herself, this young Duke was in love for the first time.\r\nWooed though he had been by almost as many maidens as she by youths, his\r\nheart, like hers, had remained cold. But he had never felt, as she\r\nhad, the desire to love. He was not now rejoicing, as she was, in the\r\nsensation of first love; nay, he was furiously mortified by it, and\r\nstruggled with all his might against it. He had always fancied himself\r\nsecure against any so vulgar peril; always fancied that by him at least,\r\nthe proud old motto of his family--\xe2\x80\x9cPas si bete\xe2\x80\x9d--would not be belied.\r\nAnd I daresay, indeed, that had he never met Zuleika, the irresistible,\r\nhe would have lived, and at a very ripe old age died, a dandy without\r\nreproach. For in him the dandiacal temper had been absolute hitherto,\r\nquite untainted and unruffled. He was too much concerned with his\r\nown perfection ever to think of admiring any one else. Different from\r\nZuleika, he cared for his wardrobe and his toilet-table not as a means\r\nto making others admire him the more, but merely as a means through\r\nwhich he could intensify, a ritual in which to express and realise, his\r\nown idolatry. At Eton he had been called \xe2\x80\x9cPeacock,\xe2\x80\x9d and this nick-name\r\nhad followed him up to Oxford. It was not wholly apposite, however. For,\r\nwhereas the peacock is a fool even among birds, the Duke had already\r\ntaken (besides a particularly brilliant First in Mods) the Stanhope,\r\nthe Newdigate, the Lothian, and the Gaisford Prize for Greek Verse. And\r\nthese things he had achieved currente calamo, \xe2\x80\x9cwielding his pen,\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\nScott said of Byron, \xe2\x80\x9cwith the easy negligence of a nobleman.\xe2\x80\x9d He was\r\nnow in his third year of residence, and was reading, a little, for\r\nLiterae Humaniores. There is no doubt that but for his untimely death he\r\nwould have taken a particularly brilliant First in that school also.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, he had many accomplishments. He was adroit in the killing\r\nof all birds and fishes, stags and foxes. He played polo, cricket,\r\nracquets, chess, and billiards as well as such things can be played.\r\nHe was fluent in all modern languages, had a very real talent in\r\nwater-colour, and was accounted, by those who had had the privilege of\r\nhearing him, the best amateur pianist on this side of the Tweed. Little\r\nwonder, then, that he was idolised by the undergraduates of his day.\r\nHe did not, however, honour many of them with his friendship. He had a\r\ntheoretic liking for them as a class, as the \xe2\x80\x9cyoung barbarians all at\r\nplay\xe2\x80\x9d in that little antique city; but individually they jarred on him,\r\nand he saw little of them. Yet he sympathised with them always, and, on\r\noccasion, would actively take their part against the dons. In the middle\r\nof his second year, he had gone so far that a College Meeting had to be\r\nheld, and he was sent down for the rest of term. The Warden placed his\r\nown landau at the disposal of the illustrious young exile, who therein\r\nwas driven to the station, followed by a long, vociferous procession\r\nof undergraduates in cabs. Now, it happened that this was a time of\r\npolitical excitement in London. The Liberals, who were in power,\r\nhad passed through the House of Commons a measure more than usually\r\nsocialistic; and this measure was down for its second reading in the\r\nLords on the very day that the Duke left Oxford, an exile. It was but a\r\nfew weeks since he had taken his seat in the Lords; and this afternoon,\r\nfor the want of anything better to do, he strayed in. The Leader of the\r\nHouse was already droning his speech for the bill, and the Duke found\r\nhimself on one of the opposite benches. There sat his compeers, sullenly\r\nwaiting to vote for a bill which every one of them detested. As the\r\nspeaker subsided, the Duke, for the fun of the thing, rose. He made\r\na long speech against the bill. His gibes at the Government were so\r\nscathing, so utterly destructive his criticism of the bill itself, so\r\nlofty and so irresistible the flights of his eloquence, that, when he\r\nresumed his seat, there was only one course left to the Leader of the\r\nHouse. He rose and, in a few husky phrases, moved that the bill \xe2\x80\x9cbe read\r\nthis day six months.\xe2\x80\x9d All England rang with the name of the young Duke.\r\nHe himself seemed to be the one person unmoved by his exploit. He did\r\nnot re-appear in the Upper Chamber, and was heard to speak in slighting\r\nterms of its architecture, as well as of its upholstery. Nevertheless,\r\nthe Prime Minister became so nervous that he procured for him, a month\r\nlater, the Sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s offer of a Garter which had just fallen vacant.\r\nThe Duke accepted it. He was, I understand, the only undergraduate on\r\nwhom this Order had ever been conferred. He was very much pleased with\r\nthe insignia, and when, on great occasions, he wore them, no one dared\r\nsay that the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s choice was not fully justified. But you\r\nmust not imagine that he cared for them as symbols of achievement and\r\npower. The dark blue riband, and the star scintillating to eight\r\npoints, the heavy mantle of blue velvet, with its lining of taffeta\r\nand shoulder-knots of white satin, the crimson surcoat, the great\r\nembullioned tassels, and the chain of linked gold, and the plumes of\r\nostrich and heron uprising from the black velvet hat--these things had\r\nfor him little significance save as a fine setting, a finer setting than\r\nthe most elaborate smoking-suit, for that perfection of aspect which\r\nthe gods had given him. This was indeed the gift he valued beyond\r\nall others. He knew well, however, that women care little for a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nappearance, and that what they seek in a man is strength of character,\r\nand rank, and wealth. These three gifts the Duke had in a high degree,\r\nand he was by women much courted because of them. Conscious that every\r\nmaiden he met was eager to be his Duchess, he had assumed always a\r\nmanner of high austerity among maidens, and even if he had wished to\r\nflirt with Zuleika he would hardly have known how to do it. But he did\r\nnot wish to flirt with her. That she had bewitched him did but make\r\nit the more needful that he should shun all converse with her. It was\r\nimperative that he should banish her from his mind, quickly. He must not\r\ndilute his own soul\xe2\x80\x99s essence. He must not surrender to any passion his\r\ndandihood. The dandy must be celibate, cloistral; is, indeed, but a monk\r\nwith a mirror for beads and breviary--an anchorite, mortifying his soul\r\nthat his body may be perfect. Till he met Zuleika, the Duke had not\r\nknown the meaning of temptation. He fought now, a St. Anthony, against\r\nthe apparition. He would not look at her, and he hated her. He loved\r\nher, and he could not help seeing her. The black pearl and the pink\r\nseemed to dangle ever nearer and clearer to him, mocking him and\r\nbeguiling. Inexpellible was her image.\r\n\r\nSo fierce was the conflict in him that his outward nonchalance gradually\r\ngave way. As dinner drew to its close, his conversation with the wife\r\nof the Oriel don flagged and halted. He sank, at length, into a deep\r\nsilence. He sat with downcast eyes, utterly distracted.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, something fell, plump! into the dark whirlpool of his\r\nthoughts. He started. The Warden was leaning forward, had just said\r\nsomething to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Duke. Dessert, he noticed, was on the\r\ntable, and he was paring an apple. The Oriel don was looking at him with\r\nsympathy, as at one who had swooned and was just \xe2\x80\x9ccoming to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it true, my dear Duke,\xe2\x80\x9d the Warden repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you have been\r\npersuaded to play to-morrow evening at the Judas concert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh yes, I am going to play something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZuleika bent suddenly forward, addressed him. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, clasping\r\nher hands beneath her chin, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you let me come and turn over the\r\nleaves for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked her full in the face. It was like seeing suddenly at close\r\nquarters some great bright monument that one has long known only as a\r\nsun-caught speck in the distance. He saw the large violet eyes open to\r\nhim, and their lashes curling to him; the vivid parted lips; and the\r\nblack pearl, and the pink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very kind,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, in a voice which sounded to him quite\r\nfar away. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I always play without notes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZuleika blushed. Not with shame, but with delirious pleasure. For that\r\nsnub she would just then have bartered all the homage she had hoarded.\r\nThis, she felt, was the climax. She would not outstay it. She rose,\r\nsmiling to the wife of the Oriel don. Every one rose. The Oriel don held\r\nopen the door, and the two ladies passed out of the room.\r\n\r\nThe Duke drew out his cigarette case. As he looked down at the\r\ncigarettes, he was vaguely conscious of some strange phenomenon\r\nsomewhere between them and his eyes. Foredone by the agitation of the\r\npast hour, he did not at once realise what it was that he saw. His\r\nimpression was of something in bad taste, some discord in his costume\r\n... a black pearl and a pink pearl in his shirt-front!\r\n\r\nJust for a moment, absurdly over-estimating poor Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s skill, he\r\nsupposed himself a victim of legerdemain. Another moment, and the import\r\nof the studs revealed itself. He staggered up from his chair, covering\r\nhis breast with one arm, and murmured that he was faint. As he hurried\r\nfrom the room, the Oriel don was pouring out a tumbler of water and\r\nsuggesting burnt feathers. The Warden, solicitous, followed him into\r\nthe hall. He snatched up his hat, gasping that he had spent a delightful\r\nevening--was very sorry--was subject to these attacks. Once outside, he\r\ntook frankly to his heels.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of the Broad, he looked back over his shoulder. He had\r\nhalf expected a scarlet figure skimming in pursuit. There was nothing.\r\nHe halted. Before him, the Broad lay empty beneath the moon. He went\r\nslowly, mechanically, to his rooms.\r\n\r\nThe high grim busts of the Emperors stared down at him, their faces more\r\nthan ever tragically cavernous and distorted. They saw and read in\r\nthat moonlight the symbols on his breast. As he stood on his doorstep,\r\nwaiting for the door to be opened, he must have seemed to them a thing\r\nfor infinite compassion. For were they not privy to the doom that the\r\nmorrow, or the morrow\xe2\x80\x99s morrow, held for him--held not indeed for him\r\nalone, yet for him especially, as it were, and for him most lamentably?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe breakfast-things were not yet cleared away. A plate streaked with\r\nfine strains of marmalade, an empty toast-rack, a broken roll--these and\r\nother things bore witness to a day inaugurated in the right spirit.\r\n\r\nAway from them, reclining along his window-seat, was the Duke. Blue\r\nspirals rose from his cigarette, nothing in the still air to trouble\r\nthem. From their railing, across the road, the Emperors gazed at him.\r\n\r\nFor a young man, sleep is a sure solvent of distress. There whirls not\r\nfor him in the night any so hideous a phantasmagoria as will not become,\r\nin the clarity of next morning, a spruce procession for him to lead.\r\nBrief the vague horror of his awakening; memory sweeps back to him,\r\nand he sees nothing dreadful after all. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d is the sun\xe2\x80\x99s bright\r\nmessage to him, and \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d his answer. After hours of\r\nagony and doubt prolonged to cock-crow, sleep had stolen to the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbed-side. He awoke late, with a heavy sense of disaster; but lo! when he\r\nremembered, everything took on a new aspect. He was in love. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He mocked himself for the morbid vigil he had spent in probing and\r\nvainly binding the wounds of his false pride. The old life was done\r\nwith. He laughed as he stepped into his bath. Why should the disseizin\r\nof his soul have seemed shameful to him? He had had no soul till it\r\npassed out of his keeping. His body thrilled to the cold water, his soul\r\nas to a new sacrament. He was in love, and that was all he wished for...\r\nThere, on the dressing-table, lay the two studs, visible symbols of his\r\nlove. Dear to him, now, the colours of them! He took them in his hand,\r\none by one, fondling them. He wished he could wear them in the day-time;\r\nbut this, of course, was impossible. His toilet finished, he dropped\r\nthem into the left pocket of his waistcoat.\r\n\r\nTherein, near to his heart, they were lying now, as he looked out at\r\nthe changed world--the world that had become Zuleika. \xe2\x80\x9cZuleika!\xe2\x80\x9d his\r\nrecurrent murmur, was really an apostrophe to the whole world.\r\n\r\nPiled against the wall were certain boxes of black japanned tin, which\r\nhad just been sent to him from London. At any other time he would\r\ncertainly not have left them unopened. For they contained his robes of\r\nthe Garter. Thursday, the day after to-morrow, was the date fixed for\r\nthe investiture of a foreign king who was now visiting England: and the\r\nfull chapter of Knights had been commanded to Windsor for the ceremony.\r\nYesterday the Duke had looked keenly forward to his excursion. It was\r\nonly in those too rarely required robes that he had the sense of being\r\nfully dressed. But to-day not a thought had he of them.\r\n\r\nSome clock clove with silver the stillness of the morning. Ere came the\r\nsecond stroke, another and nearer clock was striking. And now there were\r\nothers chiming in. The air was confused with the sweet babel of its many\r\nspires, some of them booming deep, measured sequences, some tinkling\r\nimpatiently and outwitting others which had begun before them. And when\r\nthis anthem of jealous antiphonies and uneven rhythms had dwindled quite\r\naway and fainted in one last solitary note of silver, there started\r\nsomewhere another sequence; and this, almost at its last stroke, was\r\ninterrupted by yet another, which went on to tell the hour of noon in\r\nits own way, quite slowly and significantly, as though none knew it.\r\n\r\nAnd now Oxford was astir with footsteps and laughter--the laughter and\r\nquick footsteps of youths released from lecture-rooms. The Duke shifted\r\nfrom the window. Somehow, he did not care to be observed, though it was\r\nusually at this hour that he showed himself for the setting of some\r\nnew fashion in costume. Many an undergraduate, looking up, missed the\r\npicture in the window-frame.\r\n\r\nThe Duke paced to and fro, smiling ecstatically. He took the two studs\r\nfrom his pocket and gazed at them. He looked in the glass, as one\r\nseeking the sympathy of a familiar. For the first time in his life,\r\nhe turned impatiently aside. It was a new kind of sympathy he needed\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nThe front door slammed, and the staircase creaked to the ascent of two\r\nheavy boots. The Duke listened, waited irresolute. The boots passed his\r\ndoor, were already clumping up the next flight. \xe2\x80\x9cNoaks!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. The\r\nboots paused, then clumped down again. The door opened and disclosed\r\nthat homely figure which Zuleika had seen on her way to Judas.\r\n\r\nSensitive reader, start not at the apparition! Oxford is a plexus of\r\nanomalies. These two youths were (odd as it may seem to you) subject to\r\nthe same Statutes, affiliated to the same College, reading for the same\r\nSchool; aye! and though the one had inherited half a score of noble and\r\ncastellated roofs, whose mere repairs cost him annually thousands and\r\nthousands of pounds, and the other\xe2\x80\x99s people had but one little mean\r\nsquare of lead, from which the fireworks of the Crystal Palace were\r\nclearly visible every Thursday evening, in Oxford one roof sheltered\r\nboth of them. Furthermore, there was even some measure of intimacy\r\nbetween them. It was the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s whim to condescend further in the\r\ndirection of Noaks than in any other. He saw in Noaks his own foil and\r\nantithesis, and made a point of walking up the High with him at least\r\nonce in every term. Noaks, for his part, regarded the Duke with feelings\r\nmingled of idolatry and disapproval. The Duke\xe2\x80\x99s First in Mods oppressed\r\nhim (who, by dint of dogged industry, had scraped a Second) more than\r\nall the other differences between them. But the dullard\xe2\x80\x99s envy of\r\nbrilliant men is always assuaged by the suspicion that they will come to\r\na bad end. Noaks may have regarded the Duke as a rather pathetic figure,\r\non the whole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, Noaks,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have been to a lecture?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAristotle\xe2\x80\x99s Politics,\xe2\x80\x9d nodded Noaks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what were they?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Duke. He was eager for sympathy in his\r\nlove. But so little used was he to seeking sympathy that he could not\r\nunburden himself. He temporised. Noaks muttered something about getting\r\nback to work, and fumbled with the door-handle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear fellow, don\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cSit down. Our Schools\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t come on for another year. A few minutes can\xe2\x80\x99t make a difference in\r\nyour Class. I want to--to tell you something, Noaks. Do sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoaks sat down on the edge of a chair. The Duke leaned against the\r\nmantel-piece, facing him. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose, Noaks,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have never\r\nbeen in love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I have been in love?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the little man, angrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine you in love,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine YOU. You\xe2\x80\x99re too pleased with yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d growled\r\nNoaks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpur your imagination, Noaks,\xe2\x80\x9d said his friend. \xe2\x80\x9cI AM in love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I,\xe2\x80\x9d was an unexpected answer, and the Duke (whose need of\r\nsympathy was too new to have taught him sympathy with others) laughed\r\naloud. \xe2\x80\x9cWhom do you love?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, throwing himself into an arm-chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know who she is,\xe2\x80\x9d was another unexpected answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you meet her?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere? What did you say to\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday. In the Corn. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t SAY anything to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she beautiful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. What\xe2\x80\x99s that to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDark or fair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s dark. She looks like a foreigner. She looks like--like one of\r\nthose photographs in the shop-windows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA rhapsody, Noaks! What became of her? Was she alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was with the old Warden, in his carriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZuleika--Noaks! The Duke started, as at an affront, and glared. Next\r\nmoment, he saw the absurdity of the situation. He relapsed into his\r\nchair, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s the Warden\xe2\x80\x99s niece,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI dined at the\r\nWarden\xe2\x80\x99s last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoaks sat still, peering across at the Duke. For the first time in his\r\nlife, he was resentful of the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s great elegance and average stature,\r\nhis high lineage and incomputable wealth. Hitherto, these things\r\nhad been too remote for envy. But now, suddenly, they seemed near to\r\nhim--nearer and more overpowering than the First in Mods had ever been.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd of course she\xe2\x80\x99s in love with you?\xe2\x80\x9d he snarled.\r\n\r\nReally, this was for the Duke a new issue. So salient was his own\r\npassion that he had not had time to wonder whether it were returned.\r\nZuleika\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour during dinner... But that was how so many young\r\nwomen had behaved. It was no sign of disinterested love. It might mean\r\nmerely... Yet no! Surely, looking into her eyes, he had seen there a\r\nradiance finer than could have been lit by common ambition. Love, none\r\nother, must have lit in those purple depths the torches whose clear\r\nflames had leapt out to him. She loved him. She, the beautiful, the\r\nwonderful, had not tried to conceal her love for him. She had shown him\r\nall--had shown all, poor darling! only to be snubbed by a prig, driven\r\naway by a boor, fled from by a fool. To the nethermost corner of his\r\nsoul, he cursed himself for what he had done, and for all he had left\r\nundone. He would go to her on his knees. He would implore her to impose\r\non him insufferable penances. There was no penance, how bittersweet\r\nsoever, could make him a little worthy of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried mechanically. Entered the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lady downstairs,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9casking to see your Grace. Says she\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nstep round again later if your Grace is busy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is her name?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Duke, vacantly. He was gazing at the girl\r\nwith pain-shot eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Zuleika Dobson,\xe2\x80\x9d pronounced the girl.\r\n\r\nHe rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow Miss Dobson up,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nNoaks had darted to the looking-glass and was smoothing his hair with a\r\ntremulous, enormous hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, pointing to the door. Noaks went, quickly. Echoes\r\nof his boots fell from the upper stairs and met the ascending susurrus\r\nof a silk skirt.\r\n\r\nThe lovers met. There was an interchange of ordinary greetings: from the\r\nDuke, a comment on the weather; from Zuleika, a hope that he was well\r\nagain--they had been so sorry to lose him last night. Then came a pause.\r\nThe landlady\xe2\x80\x99s daughter was clearing away the breakfast-things.\r\nZuleika glanced comprehensively at the room, and the Duke gazed at the\r\nhearthrug. The landlady\xe2\x80\x99s daughter clattered out with her freight. They\r\nwere alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow pretty!\xe2\x80\x9d said Zuleika. She was looking at his star of the Garter,\r\nwhich sparkled from a litter of books and papers on a small side-table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is pretty, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAwfully pretty!\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined.\r\n\r\nThis dialogue led them to another hollow pause. The Duke\xe2\x80\x99s heart beat\r\nviolently within him. Why had he not asked her to take the star and keep\r\nit as a gift? Too late now! Why could he not throw himself at her feet?\r\nHere were two beings, lovers of each other, with none by. And yet...\r\n\r\nShe was examining a water-colour on the wall, seemed to be absorbed by\r\nit. He watched her. She was even lovelier than he had remembered;\r\nor rather her loveliness had been, in some subtle way, transmuted.\r\nSomething had given to her a graver, nobler beauty. Last night\xe2\x80\x99s nymph\r\nhad become the Madonna of this morning. Despite her dress, which was\r\nof a tremendous tartan, she diffused the pale authentic radiance of a\r\nspirituality most high, most simple. The Duke wondered where lay the\r\nchange in her. He could not understand. Suddenly she turned to him, and\r\nhe understood. No longer the black pearl and the pink, but two white\r\npearls!... He thrilled to his heart\xe2\x80\x99s core.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zuleika, \xe2\x80\x9cyou aren\xe2\x80\x99t awfully vexed with me for coming\r\nlike this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cI am delighted to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d How inadequate\r\nthe words sounded, how formal and stupid!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know a soul in Oxford. And\r\nI thought perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d give me luncheon, and take me to see the\r\nboat-races. Will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be charmed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pulling the bell-rope. Poor fool! he\r\nattributed the shade of disappointment on Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s face to the coldness\r\nof his tone. He would dispel that shade. He would avow himself. He would\r\nleave her no longer in this false position. So soon as he had told them\r\nabout the meal, he would proclaim his passion.\r\n\r\nThe bell was answered by the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Dobson will stay to luncheon,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke. The girl withdrew.\r\nHe wished he could have asked her not to.\r\n\r\nHe steeled himself. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Dobson,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to apologise to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZuleika looked at him eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t give me luncheon? You\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nsomething better to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I wish to ask you to forgive me for my behaviour last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing to forgive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is. My manners were vile. I know well what happened. Though you,\r\ntoo, cannot have forgotten, I won\xe2\x80\x99t spare myself the recital. You were\r\nmy hostess, and I ignored you. Magnanimous, you paid me the prettiest\r\ncompliment woman ever paid to man, and I insulted you. I left the house\r\nin order that I might not see you again. To the doorsteps down which\r\nhe should have kicked me, your grandfather followed me with words of\r\nkindliest courtesy. If he had sped me with a kick so skilful that my\r\nskull had been shattered on the kerb, neither would he have outstepped\r\nthose bounds set to the conduct of English gentlemen, nor would you have\r\ngarnered more than a trifle on account of your proper reckoning. I do\r\nnot say that you are the first person whom I have wantonly injured. But\r\nit is a fact that I, in whom pride has ever been the topmost quality,\r\nhave never expressed sorrow to any one for anything. Thus, I might urge\r\nthat my present abjectness must be intolerably painful to me, and should\r\nincline you to forgive. But such an argument were specious merely.\r\nI will be quite frank with you. I will confess to you that, in this\r\nhumbling of myself before you, I take a pleasure as passionate as it is\r\nstrange. A confusion of feelings? Yet you, with a woman\xe2\x80\x99s instinct, will\r\nhave already caught the clue to it. It needs no mirror to assure me\r\nthat the clue is here for you, in my eyes. It needs no dictionary of\r\nquotations to remind me that the eyes are the windows of the soul. And I\r\nknow that from two open windows my soul has been leaning and signalling\r\nto you, in a code far more definitive and swifter than words of mine,\r\nthat I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZuleika, listening to him, had grown gradually paler and paler. She had\r\nraised her hands and cowered as though he were about to strike her. And\r\nthen, as he pronounced the last three words, she had clasped her hands\r\nto her face and with a wild sob darted away from him. She was leaning\r\nnow against the window, her head bowed and her shoulders quivering.\r\n\r\nThe Duke came softly behind her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you cry? Why should you\r\nturn away from me? Did I frighten you with the suddenness of my words? I\r\nam not versed in the tricks of wooing. I should have been more patient.\r\nBut I love you so much that I could hardly have waited. A secret hope\r\nthat you loved me too emboldened me, compelled me. You DO love me. I\r\nknow it. And, knowing it, I do but ask you to give yourself to me, to\r\nbe my wife. Why should you cry? Why should you shrink from me? Dear,\r\nif there were anything... any secret... if you had ever loved and been\r\ndeceived, do you think I should honour you the less deeply, should not\r\ncherish you the more tenderly? Enough for me, that you are mine. Do you\r\nthink I should ever reproach you for anything that may have--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZuleika turned on him. \xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you?\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you speak\r\nto me like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke reeled back. Horror had come into his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do not love\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLOVE you?\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cYOU?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou no longer love me. Why? Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou loved me. Don\xe2\x80\x99t trifle with me. You came to me loving me with all\r\nyour heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook in the glass.\xe2\x80\x9d She went at his bidding. He followed her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nsee them?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after a long pause. Zuleika nodded. The two pearls\r\nquivered to her nod.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were white when you came to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were white\r\nbecause you loved me. From them it was that I knew you loved me even as\r\nI loved you. But their old colours have come back to them. That is how I\r\nknow that your love for me is dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZuleika stood gazing pensively, twitching the two pearls between her\r\nfingers. Tears gathered in her eyes. She met the reflection of her\r\nlover\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and her tears brimmed over. She buried her face in her\r\nhands, and sobbed like a child.\r\n\r\nLike a child\xe2\x80\x99s, her sobbing ceased quite suddenly. She groped for her\r\nhandkerchief, angrily dried her eyes, and straightened and smoothed\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I\xe2\x80\x99m going,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou came here of your own accord, because you loved me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you shall not go till you have told me why you have left off loving\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you know I loved you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked after a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you\r\nknow I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t simply put on another pair of ear-rings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke, with a melancholy laugh, drew the two studs from his\r\nwaistcoat-pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are the studs I wore last night,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nZuleika gazed at them. \xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; then, looking up, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen did\r\nthey become like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was when you left the dining-room that I saw the change in them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow strange! It was when I went into the drawing-room that I noticed\r\nmine. I was looking in the glass, and\xe2\x80\x9d--She started. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you were in\r\nlove with me last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI began to be in love with you from the moment I saw you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen how could you have behaved as you did?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I was a pedant. I tried to ignore you, as pedants always do try\r\nto ignore any fact they cannot fit into their pet system. The basis\r\nof my pet system was celibacy. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean the mere state of being\r\na bachelor. I mean celibacy of the soul--egoism, in fact. You have\r\nconverted me from that. I am now a confirmed tuist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dared you insult me?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, with a stamp of her foot.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dared you make a fool of me before those people? Oh, it is too\r\ninfamous!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have already asked you to forgive me for that. You said there was\r\nnothing to forgive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t dream that you were in love with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat difference can that make?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the difference! All the difference in life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down! You bewilder me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cExplain yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncommanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that rather much for a man to ask of a woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I have no experience of women. In the abstract, it seems\r\nto me that every man has a right to some explanation from the woman who\r\nhas ruined his life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are frightfully sorry for yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zuleika, with a bitter\r\nlaugh. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t occur to you that _I_ am at all to be\r\npitied. No! you are blind with selfishness. You love me--I don\xe2\x80\x99t love\r\nyou: that is all you can realise. Probably you think you are the first\r\nman who has ever fallen on such a plight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSaid the Duke, bowing over a deprecatory hand, \xe2\x80\x9cIf there were to pass my\r\nwindow one tithe of them whose hearts have been lost to Miss Dobson, I\r\nshould win no solace from that interminable parade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZuleika blushed. \xe2\x80\x9cYet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said more gently, \xe2\x80\x9cbe sure they would all be\r\nnot a little envious of YOU! Not one of them ever touched the surface of\r\nmy heart. You stirred my heart to its very depths. Yes, you made me love\r\nyou madly. The pearls told you no lie. You were my idol--the one thing\r\nin the wide world to me. You were so different from any man I had ever\r\nseen except in dreams. You did not make a fool of yourself. I admired\r\nyou. I respected you. I was all afire with adoration of you. And now,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she passed her hand across her eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cnow it is all over. The idol has\r\ncome sliding down its pedestal to fawn and grovel with all the other\r\ninfatuates in the dust about my feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke looked thoughtfully at her. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\r\nrevelled in your power over men\xe2\x80\x99s hearts. I had always heard that you\r\nlived for admiration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zuleika, \xe2\x80\x9cof course I like being admired. Oh yes, I like all\r\nthat very much indeed. In a way, I suppose, I\xe2\x80\x99m even pleased that\r\nYOU admire me. But oh, what a little miserable pleasure that is in\r\ncomparison with the rapture I have forfeited! I had never known the\r\nrapture of being in love. I had longed for it, but I had never guessed\r\nhow wonderfully wonderful it was. It came to me. I shuddered and wavered\r\nlike a fountain in the wind. I was more helpless and flew lightlier\r\nthan a shred of thistledown among the stars. All night long, I could not\r\nsleep for love of you; nor had I any desire of sleep, save that it might\r\ntake me to you in a dream. I remember nothing that happened to me this\r\nmorning before I found myself at your door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you ring the bell? Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you walk away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? I had come to see you, to be near you, to be WITH you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo force yourself on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know the meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x98effective occupation\xe2\x80\x99? Having marched\r\nin, how could you have held your position, unless\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, a man doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily drive a woman away because he isn\xe2\x80\x99t in\r\nlove with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet that was what you thought I had done to you last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you would take the trouble to do it again.\r\nAnd if you had, I should have only loved you the more. I thought you\r\nwould most likely be rather amused, rather touched, by my importunity. I\r\nthought you would take a listless advantage, make a plaything of me--the\r\ndiversion of a few idle hours in summer, and then, when you had tired\r\nof me, would cast me aside, forget me, break my heart. I desired nothing\r\nbetter than that. That is what I must have been vaguely hoping for. But\r\nI had no definite scheme. I wanted to be with you and I came to you. It\r\nseems years ago, now! How my heart beat as I waited on the doorstep! \xe2\x80\x98Is\r\nhis Grace at home?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99ll inquire. What name shall I say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI saw in the girl\xe2\x80\x99s eyes that she, too, loved you. Have YOU seen that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never looked at her,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo wonder, then, that she loves you,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Zuleika. \xe2\x80\x9cShe read my\r\nsecret at a glance. Women who love the same man have a kind of bitter\r\nfreemasonry. We resented each other. She envied me my beauty, my dress.\r\nI envied the little fool her privilege of being always near to you.\r\nLoving you, I could conceive no life sweeter than hers--to be always\r\nnear you; to black your boots, carry up your coals, scrub your doorstep;\r\nalways to be working for you, hard and humbly and without thanks. If you\r\nhad refused to see me, I would have bribed that girl with all my jewels\r\nto cede me her position.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke made a step towards her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou would do it still,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a\r\nlow voice.\r\n\r\nZuleika raised her eyebrows. \xe2\x80\x9cI would not offer her one garnet,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou SHALL love me again,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI will force you to. You said just\r\nnow that you had ceased to love me because I was just like other men. I\r\nam not. My heart is no tablet of mere wax, from which an instant\xe2\x80\x99s heat\r\ncan dissolve whatever impress it may bear, leaving it blank and soft\r\nfor another impress, and another, and another. My heart is a bright hard\r\ngem, proof against any die. Came Cupid, with one of his arrow-points\r\nfor graver, and what he cut on the gem\xe2\x80\x99s surface never can be effaced.\r\nThere, deeply and forever, your image is intagliated. No years, nor\r\nfires, nor cataclysm of total Nature, can efface from that great gem\r\nyour image.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Duke,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zuleika, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t be so silly. Look at the matter\r\nsensibly. I know that lovers don\xe2\x80\x99t try to regulate their emotions\r\naccording to logic; but they do, nevertheless, unconsciously conform\r\nwith some sort of logical system. I left off loving you when I found\r\nthat you loved me. There is the premiss. Very well! Is it likely that I\r\nshall begin to love you again because you can\xe2\x80\x99t leave off loving me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke groaned. There was a clatter of plates outside, and she whom\r\nZuleika had envied came to lay the table for luncheon.\r\n\r\nA smile flickered across Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s lips; and \xe2\x80\x9cNot one garnet!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nmurmured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nLuncheon passed in almost unbroken silence. Both Zuleika and the Duke\r\nwere ravenously hungry, as people always are after the stress of any\r\ngreat emotional crisis. Between them, they made very short work of\r\na cold chicken, a salad, a gooseberry-tart and a Camembert. The Duke\r\nfilled his glass again and again. The cold classicism of his face had\r\nbeen routed by the new romantic movement which had swept over his soul.\r\nHe looked two or three months older than when first I showed him to my\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nHe drank his coffee at one draught, pushed back his chair, threw away\r\nthe cigarette he had just lit. \xe2\x80\x9cListen!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nZuleika folded her hands on her lap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not love me. I accept as final your hint that you never will\r\nlove me. I need not say--could not, indeed, ever say--how deeply, deeply\r\nyou have pained me. As lover, I am rejected. But that rejection,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, striking the table, \xe2\x80\x9cis no stopper to my suit. It does but\r\ndrive me to the use of arguments. My pride shrinks from them. Love,\r\nhowever, is greater than pride; and I, John, Albert, Edward, Claude,\r\nOrde, Angus, Tankerton,* Tanville-Tankerton,** fourteenth Duke of\r\nDorset, Marquis of Dorset, Earl of Grove, Earl of Chastermaine, Viscount\r\nBrewsby, Baron Grove, Baron Petstrap, and Baron Wolock, in the Peerage\r\nof England, offer you my hand. Do not interrupt me. Do not toss your\r\nhead. Consider well what I am saying. Weigh the advantages you would\r\ngain by acceptance of my hand. Indeed, they are manifold and tremendous.\r\nThey are also obvious: do not shut your eyes to them. You, Miss Dobson,\r\nwhat are you? A conjurer, and a vagrant; without means, save such as you\r\ncan earn by the sleight of your hand; without position; without a\r\nhome; all unguarded but by your own self-respect. That you follow an\r\nhonourable calling, I do not for one moment deny. I do, however, ask\r\nyou to consider how great are its perils and hardships, its fatigues and\r\ninconveniences. From all these evils I offer you instant refuge. I offer\r\nyou, Miss Dobson, a refuge more glorious and more augustly gilded\r\nthan you, in your airiest flights of fancy, can ever have hoped for or\r\nimagined. I own about 340,000 acres. My town-residence is in St. James\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nSquare. Tankerton, of which you may have seen photographs, is the chief\r\nof my country-seats. It is a Tudor house, set on the ridge of a valley.\r\nThe valley, its park, is halved by a stream so narrow that the deer leap\r\nacross. The gardens are estraded upon the slope. Round the house runs\r\na wide paven terrace. There are always two or three peacocks trailing\r\ntheir sheathed feathers along the balustrade, and stepping how stiffly!\r\nas though they had just been unharnessed from Juno\xe2\x80\x99s chariot. Two\r\nflights of shallow steps lead down to the flowers and fountains. Oh,\r\nthe gardens are wonderful. There is a Jacobean garden of white roses.\r\nBetween the ends of two pleached alleys, under a dome of branches, is\r\na little lake, with a Triton of black marble, and with water-lilies.\r\nHither and thither under the archipelago of water-lilies, dart\r\ngold-fish--tongues of flame in the dark water. There is also a long\r\nstrait alley of clipped yew. It ends in an alcove for a pagoda\r\nof painted porcelain which the Prince Regent--peace be to his\r\nashes!--presented to my great-grandfather. There are many twisting\r\npaths, and sudden aspects, and devious, fantastic arbours. Are you fond\r\nof horses? In my stables of pine-wood and plated-silver seventy are\r\ninstalled. Not all of them together could vie in power with one of the\r\nmeanest of my motor-cars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n   *Pronounced as Tacton.\r\n\r\n  **Pronounced as Tavvle-Tacton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I never go in motors,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zuleika. \xe2\x80\x9cThey make one look like\r\nnothing on earth, and like everybody else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cuse them little for that very reason. Are\r\nyou interested in farming? At Tankerton there is a model farm which\r\nwould at any rate amuse you, with its heifers and hens and pigs that are\r\nlike so many big new toys. There is a tiny dairy, which is called \xe2\x80\x98Her\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99 You could make, therein, real butter with your own hands, and\r\nround it into little pats, and press every pat with a different device.\r\nThe boudoir that would be yours is a blue room. Four Watteaus hang in\r\nit. In the dining-hall hang portraits of my forefathers--in petto,\r\nyour forefathers-in-law--by many masters. Are you fond of peasants?\r\nMy tenantry are delightful creatures, and there is not one of them who\r\nremembers the bringing of the news of the Battle of Waterloo. When a\r\nnew Duchess is brought to Tankerton, the oldest elm in the park must\r\nbe felled. That is one of many strange old customs. As she is driven\r\nthrough the village, the children of the tenantry must strew the road\r\nwith daisies. The bridal chamber must be lighted with as many candles as\r\nyears have elapsed since the creation of the Dukedom. If you came into\r\nit, there would be\xe2\x80\x9d--and the youth, closing his eyes, made a rapid\r\ncalculation--\xe2\x80\x9cexactly three hundred and eighty-eight candles. On the eve\r\nof the death of a Duke of Dorset, two black owls come and perch on the\r\nbattlements. They remain there through the night, hooting. At dawn\r\nthey fly away, none knows whither. On the eve of the death of any other\r\nTanville-Tankerton, comes (no matter what be the time of year) a cuckoo.\r\nIt stays for an hour, cooing, then flies away, none knows whither.\r\nWhenever this portent occurs, my steward telegraphs to me, that I, as\r\nhead of the family, be not unsteeled against the shock of a bereavement,\r\nand that my authority be sooner given for the unsealing and garnishing\r\nof the family-vault. Not every forefather of mine rests quiet beneath\r\nhis escutcheoned marble. There are they who revisit, in their wrath or\r\ntheir remorse, the places wherein erst they suffered or wrought evil.\r\nThere is one who, every Halloween, flits into the dining-hall, and\r\nhovers before the portrait which Hans Holbein made of him, and flings\r\nhis diaphanous grey form against the canvas, hoping, maybe, to catch\r\nfrom it the fiery flesh-tints and the solid limbs that were his, and so\r\nto be re-incarnate. He flies against the painting, only to find himself\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99other side of the wall it hangs on. There are five ghosts permanently\r\nresiding in the right wing of the house, two in the left, and eleven in\r\nthe park. But all are quite noiseless and quite harmless. My servants,\r\nwhen they meet them in the corridors or on the stairs, stand aside to\r\nlet them pass, thus paying them the respect due to guests of mine; but\r\nnot even the rawest housemaid ever screams or flees at sight of them. I,\r\ntheir host, often waylay them and try to commune with them; but always\r\nthey glide past me. And how gracefully they glide, these ghosts! It is a\r\npleasure to watch them. It is a lesson in deportment. May they never be\r\nlaid! Of all my household-pets, they are the dearest to me. I am Duke\r\nof Strathsporran and Cairngorm, Marquis of Sorby, and Earl Cairngorm, in\r\nthe Peerage of Scotland. In the glens of the hills about Strathsporran\r\nare many noble and nimble stags. But I have never set foot in my house\r\nthere, for it is carpeted throughout with the tartan of my clan. You\r\nseem to like tartan. What tartan is it you are wearing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZuleika looked down at her skirt. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI got it in\r\nParis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cit is very ugly. The Dalbraith tartan is\r\nharmonious in comparison, and has, at least, the excuse of history. If\r\nyou married me, you would have the right to wear it. You would have many\r\nstrange and fascinating rights. You would go to Court. I admit that the\r\nHanoverian Court is not much. Still, it is better than nothing. At your\r\npresentation, moreover, you would be given the entree. Is that nothing\r\nto you? You would be driven to Court in my statecoach. It is swung so\r\nhigh that the streetsters can hardly see its occupant. It is lined\r\nwith rose-silk; and on its panels, and on its hammer-cloth, my arms\r\nare emblazoned--no one has ever been able to count the quarterings. You\r\nwould be wearing the family-jewels, reluctantly surrendered to you by my\r\naunt. They are many and marvellous, in their antique settings. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant to brag. It humiliates me to speak to you as I am speaking. But\r\nI am heart-set on you, and to win you there is not a precious stone I\r\nwould leave unturned. Conceive a parure all of white stones--diamonds,\r\nwhite sapphires, white topazes, tourmalines. Another, of rubies and\r\namethysts, set in gold filigree. Rings that once were poison-combs on\r\nFlorentine fingers. Red roses for your hair--every petal a hollowed\r\nruby. Amulets and ape-buckles, zones and fillets. Aye! know that you\r\nwould be weeping for wonder before you had seen a tithe of these gauds.\r\nKnow, too, Miss Dobson, that in the Peerage of France I am Duc d\xe2\x80\x99Etretat\r\net de la Roche Guillaume. Louis Napoleon gave the title to my father for\r\nnot cutting him in the Bois. I have a house in the Champs Elysees. There\r\nis a Swiss in its courtyard. He stands six-foot-seven in his stockings,\r\nand the chasseurs are hardly less tall than he. Wherever I go, there are\r\ntwo chefs in my retinue. Both are masters in their art, and furiously\r\njealous of each other. When I compliment either of them on some dish,\r\nthe other challenges him. They fight with rapiers, next morning, in the\r\ngarden of whatever house I am occupying. I do not know whether you are\r\ngreedy? If so, it may interest you to learn that I have a third chef,\r\nwho makes only souffles, and an Italian pastry-cook; to say nothing of\r\na Spaniard for salads, an Englishwoman for roasts, and an Abyssinian for\r\ncoffee. You found no trace of their handiwork in the meal you have just\r\nhad with me? No; for in Oxford it is a whim of mine--I may say a point\r\nof honour--to lead the ordinary life of an undergraduate. What I eat\r\nin this room is cooked by the heavy and unaided hand of Mrs. Batch,\r\nmy landlady. It is set before me by the unaided and--or are you in\r\nerror?--loving hand of her daughter. Other ministers have I none here. I\r\ndispense with my private secretaries. I am unattended by a single valet.\r\nSo simple a way of life repels you? You would never be called upon to\r\nshare it. If you married me, I should take my name off the books of my\r\nCollege. I propose that we should spend our honeymoon at Baiae. I have\r\na villa at Baiae. It is there that I keep my grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s collection of\r\nmajolica. The sun shines there always. A long olive-grove secretes the\r\ngarden from the sea. When you walk in the garden, you know the sea only\r\nin blue glimpses through the vacillating leaves. White-gleaming from the\r\nbosky shade of this grove are several goddesses. Do you care for Canova?\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t myself. If you do, these figures will appeal to you: they are in\r\nhis best manner. Do you love the sea? This is not the only house of mine\r\nthat looks out on it. On the coast of County Clare--am I not Earl of\r\nEnniskerry and Baron Shandrin in the Peerage of Ireland?--I have an\r\nancient castle. Sheer from a rock stands it, and the sea has always\r\nraged up against its walls. Many ships lie wrecked under that loud\r\nimplacable sea. But mine is a brave strong castle. No storm affrights\r\nit; and not the centuries, clustering houris, with their caresses can\r\nseduce it from its hard austerity. I have several titles which for the\r\nmoment escape me. Baron Llffthwchl am I, and... and... but you can\r\nfind them for yourself in Debrett. In me you behold a Prince of the Holy\r\nRoman Empire, and a Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. Look\r\nwell at me! I am Hereditary Comber of the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Lap-Dogs. I am young.\r\nI am handsome. My temper is sweet, and my character without blemish. In\r\nfine, Miss Dobson, I am a most desirable parti.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zuleika, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke stamped his foot. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d he said hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nought not to have done that. But--you seem to have entirely missed the\r\npoint of what I was saying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zuleika.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Duke, standing over her, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is your reply?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSaid Zuleika, looking up at him, \xe2\x80\x9cMy reply is that I think you are an\r\nawful snob.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke turned on his heel, and strode to the other end of the room.\r\nThere he stood for some moments, his back to Zuleika.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed in a slow, meditative voice, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are, with\r\nthe possible exception of a Mr. Edelweiss, THE most awful snob I have\r\never met.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke looked back over his shoulder. He gave Zuleika the stinging\r\nreprimand of silence. She was sorry, and showed it in her eyes. She felt\r\nshe had gone too far. True, he was nothing to her now. But she had loved\r\nhim once. She could not forget that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us be good friends. Give me your hand!\xe2\x80\x9d He came\r\nto her, slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke withdrew his fingers before she unclasped them. That\r\ntwice-flung taunt rankled still. It was monstrous to have been called\r\na snob. A snob!--he, whose readiness to form what would certainly be\r\nregarded as a shocking misalliance ought to have stifled the charge, not\r\nmerely vindicated him from it! He had forgotten, in the blindness of his\r\nlove, how shocking the misalliance would be. Perhaps she, unloving, had\r\nnot been so forgetful? Perhaps her refusal had been made, generously,\r\nfor his own sake. Nay, rather for her own. Evidently, she had felt that\r\nthe high sphere from which he beckoned was no place for the likes of\r\nher. Evidently, she feared she would pine away among those strange\r\nsplendours, never be acclimatised, always be unworthy. He had thought to\r\noverwhelm her, and he had done his work too thoroughly. Now he must try\r\nto lighten the load he had imposed.\r\n\r\nSeating himself opposite to her, \xe2\x80\x9cYou remember,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there is\r\na dairy at Tankerton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA dairy? Oh yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember what it is called?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZuleika knit her brows.\r\n\r\nHe helped her out. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is called \xe2\x80\x98Her Grace\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, of course!\xe2\x80\x9d said Zuleika.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know WHY it is called so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let\xe2\x80\x99s see... I know you told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I? I think not. I will tell you now... That cool out-house dates\r\nfrom the middle of the eighteenth century. My great-great-grandfather,\r\nwhen he was a very old man, married en troisiemes noces a dairy-maid\r\non the Tankerton estate. Meg Speedwell was her name. He had seen her\r\nwalking across a field, not many months after the interment of his\r\nsecond Duchess, Maria, that great and gifted lady. I know not whether it\r\nwas that her bonny mien fanned in him some embers of his youth, or that\r\nhe was loth to be outdone in gracious eccentricity by his crony the Duke\r\nof Dewlap, who himself had just taken a bride from a dairy. (You have\r\nread Meredith\xe2\x80\x99s account of that affair? No? You should.) Whether it was\r\nveritable love or mere modishness that formed my ancestor\xe2\x80\x99s resolve,\r\npresently the bells were ringing out, and the oldest elm in the park was\r\nbeing felled, in Meg Speedwell\xe2\x80\x99s honour, and the children were strewing\r\ndaisies on which Meg Speedwell trod, a proud young hoyden of a bride,\r\nwith her head in the air and her heart in the seventh heaven. The Duke\r\nhad given her already a horde of fine gifts; but these, he had said,\r\nwere nothing--trash in comparison with the gift that was to ensure for\r\nher a perdurable felicity. After the wedding-breakfast, when all the\r\nsquires had ridden away on their cobs, and all the squires\xe2\x80\x99 ladies in\r\ntheir coaches, the Duke led his bride forth from the hall, leaning on\r\nher arm, till they came to a little edifice of new white stone, very\r\nspick and span, with two lattice-windows and a bright green door\r\nbetween. This he bade her enter. A-flutter with excitement, she\r\nturned the handle. In a moment she flounced back, red with shame and\r\nanger--flounced forth from the fairest, whitest, dapperest dairy,\r\nwherein was all of the best that the keenest dairy-maid might need. The\r\nDuke bade her dry her eyes, for that it ill befitted a great lady to be\r\nweeping on her wedding-day. \xe2\x80\x98As for gratitude,\xe2\x80\x99 he chuckled, \xe2\x80\x98zounds!\r\nthat is a wine all the better for the keeping.\xe2\x80\x99 Duchess Meg soon forgot\r\nthis unworthy wedding-gift, such was her rapture in the other, the so\r\naugust, appurtenances of her new life. What with her fine silk gowns\r\nand farthingales, and her powder-closet, and the canopied bed she slept\r\nin--a bed bigger far than the room she had slept in with her sisters,\r\nand standing in a room far bigger than her father\xe2\x80\x99s cottage; and\r\nwhat with Betty, her maid, who had pinched and teased her at the\r\nvillage-school, but now waited on her so meekly and trembled so\r\nfearfully at a scolding; and what with the fine hot dishes that were set\r\nbefore her every day, and the gallant speeches and glances of the fine\r\nyoung gentlemen whom the Duke invited from London, Duchess Meg was quite\r\nthe happiest Duchess in all England. For a while, she was like a child\r\nin a hay-rick. But anon, as the sheer delight of novelty wore away, she\r\nbegan to take a more serious view of her position. She began to realise\r\nher responsibilities. She was determined to do all that a great lady\r\nought to do. Twice every day she assumed the vapours. She schooled\r\nherself in the mysteries of Ombre, of Macao. She spent hours over the\r\ntambour-frame. She rode out on horse-back, with a riding-master. She had\r\na music-master to teach her the spinet; a dancing-master, too, to teach\r\nher the Minuet and the Triumph and the Gaudy. All these accomplishments\r\nshe found mighty hard. She was afraid of her horse. All the morning, she\r\ndreaded the hour when it would be brought round from the stables. She\r\ndreaded her dancing-lesson. Try as she would, she could but stamp her\r\nfeet flat on the parquet, as though it had been the village-green. She\r\ndreaded her music-lesson. Her fingers, disobedient to her ambition,\r\nclumsily thumped the keys of the spinet, and by the notes of the score\r\npropped up before her she was as cruelly perplexed as by the black and\r\nred pips of the cards she conned at the gaming-table, or by the red\r\nand gold threads that were always straying and snapping on her\r\ntambour-frame. Still she persevered. Day in, day out, sullenly, she\r\nworked hard to be a great lady. But skill came not to her, and hope\r\ndwindled; only the dull effort remained. One accomplishment she did\r\nmaster--to wit, the vapours: they became for her a dreadful reality. She\r\nlost her appetite for the fine hot dishes. All night long she lay awake,\r\nrestless, tearful, under the fine silk canopy, till dawn stared her\r\ninto slumber. She seldom scolded Betty. She who had been so lusty and so\r\nblooming saw in her mirror that she was pale and thin now; and the fine\r\nyoung gentlemen, seeing it too, paid more heed now to their wine and\r\ntheir dice than to her. And always, when she met him, the Duke smiled\r\nthe same mocking smile. Duchess Meg was pining slowly and surely away...\r\nOne morning, in Spring-time, she altogether vanished. Betty, bringing\r\nthe cup of chocolate to the bedside, found the bed empty. She raised the\r\nalarm among her fellows. They searched high and low. Nowhere was their\r\nmistress. The news was broken to their master, who, without comment,\r\nrose, bade his man dress him, and presently walked out to the place\r\nwhere he knew he would find her. And there, to be sure, she was,\r\nchurning, churning for dear life. Her sleeves were rolled above her\r\nelbows, and her skirt was kilted high; and, as she looked back over her\r\nshoulder and saw the Duke, there was the flush of roses in her cheeks,\r\nand the light of a thousand thanks in her eyes. \xe2\x80\x98Oh,\xe2\x80\x99 she cried, \xe2\x80\x98what\r\na curtsey I would drop you, but that to let go the handle were to spoil\r\nall!\xe2\x80\x99 And every morning, ever after, she woke when the birds woke, rose\r\nwhen they rose, and went singing through the dawn to the dairy, there to\r\npractise for her pleasure that sweet and lowly handicraft which she had\r\nonce practised for her need. And every evening, with her milking-stool\r\nunder her arm, and her milk-pail in her hand, she went into the field\r\nand called the cows to her, as she had been wont to do. To those other,\r\nthose so august, accomplishments she no more pretended. She gave them\r\nthe go-by. And all the old zest and joyousness of her life came back\r\nto her. Soundlier than ever slept she, and sweetlier dreamed, under the\r\nfine silk canopy, till the birds called her to her work. Greater than\r\never was her love of the fine furbelows that were hers to flaunt in, and\r\nsharper her appetite for the fine hot dishes, and more tempestuous her\r\nscolding of Betty, poor maid. She was more than ever now the cynosure,\r\nthe adored, of the fine young gentlemen. And as for her husband, she\r\nlooked up to him as the wisest, kindest man in all the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the fine young gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zuleika, \xe2\x80\x9cdid she fall in love with\r\nany of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou forget,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke coldly, \xe2\x80\x9cshe was married to a member of my\r\nfamily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I beg your pardon. But tell me: did they ALL adore her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Every one of them, wildly, madly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Zuleika, with a smile of understanding. A shadow crossed\r\nher face, \xe2\x80\x9cEven so,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with some pique, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose she had\r\nso very many adorers. She never went out into the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTankerton,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke drily, \xe2\x80\x9cis a large house, and my\r\ngreat-great-grandfather was the most hospitable of men. However,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, marvelling that she had again missed the point so utterly, \xe2\x80\x9cmy\r\npurpose was not to confront you with a past rival in conquest, but to\r\nset at rest a fear which I had, I think, roused in you by my somewhat\r\nfull description of the high majestic life to which you, as my bride,\r\nwould be translated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fear? What sort of a fear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you would not breathe freely--that you would starve (if I may use\r\na somewhat fantastic figure) among those strawberry-leaves. And so I\r\ntold you the story of Meg Speedwell, and how she lived happily ever\r\nafter. Nay, hear me out! The blood of Meg Speedwell\xe2\x80\x99s lord flows in\r\nmy veins. I think I may boast that I have inherited something of his\r\nsagacity. In any case, I can profit by his example. Do not fear that\r\nI, if you were to wed me, should demand a metamorphosis of your present\r\nself. I should take you as you are, gladly. I should encourage you to be\r\nalways exactly as you are--a radiant, irresistible member of the upper\r\nmiddle-class, with a certain freedom of manner acquired through a\r\nlife of peculiar liberty. Can you guess what would be my principal\r\nwedding-gift to you? Meg Speedwell had her dairy. For you, would be\r\nbuilt another outhouse--a neat hall wherein you would perform your\r\nconjuring-tricks, every evening except Sunday, before me and my tenants\r\nand my servants, and before such of my neighbours as might care to come.\r\nNone would respect you the less, seeing that I approved. Thus in\r\nyou would the pleasant history of Meg Speedwell repeat itself. You,\r\npractising for your pleasure--nay, hear me out!--that sweet and lowly\r\nhandicraft which--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t listen to another word!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Zuleika. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are the most\r\ninsolent person I have ever met. I happen to come of a particularly good\r\nfamily. I move in the best society. My manners are absolutely perfect.\r\nIf I found myself in the shoes of twenty Duchesses simultaneously, I\r\nshould know quite well how to behave. As for the one pair you can offer\r\nme, I kick them away--so. I kick them back at you. I tell you--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9chush! You are over-excited. There will be a\r\ncrowd under my window. There, there! I am sorry. I thought--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know what you thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zuleika, in a quieter tone. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nsure you meant well. I am sorry I lost my temper. Only, you might have\r\ngiven me credit for meaning what I said: that I would not marry you,\r\nbecause I did not love you. I daresay there would be great advantages\r\nin being your Duchess. But the fact is, I have no worldly wisdom. To me,\r\nmarriage is a sacrament. I could no more marry a man about whom I could\r\nnot make a fool of myself than I could marry one who made a fool of\r\nhimself about me. Else had I long ceased to be a spinster. Oh my friend,\r\ndo not imagine that I have not rejected, in my day, a score of suitors\r\nquite as eligible as you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs eligible? Who were they?\xe2\x80\x9d frowned the Duke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Archduke this, and Grand Duke that, and His Serene Highness the\r\nother. I have a wretched memory for names.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my name, too, will soon escape you, perhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Oh, no. I shall always remember yours. You see, I was in love with\r\nyou. You deceived me into loving you...\xe2\x80\x9d She sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, had you but\r\nbeen as strong as I thought you... Still, a swain the more. That is\r\nsomething.\xe2\x80\x9d She leaned forward, smiling archly. \xe2\x80\x9cThose studs--show me\r\nthem again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke displayed them in the hollow of his hand. She touched them\r\nlightly, reverently, as a tourist touches a sacred relic in a church.\r\n\r\nAt length, \xe2\x80\x9cDo give me them,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will keep them in a little\r\nsecret partition of my jewel-case.\xe2\x80\x9d The Duke had closed his fist. \xe2\x80\x9cDo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cMy other jewels--they have no separate meanings for me.\r\nI never remember who gave me this one or that. These would be quite\r\ndifferent. I should always remember their history... Do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk me for anything else,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are the one thing I\r\ncould not part with--even to you, for whose sake they are hallowed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZuleika pouted. On the verge of persisting, she changed her mind, and\r\nwas silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d she said abruptly, \xe2\x80\x9chow about these races? Are you going to take\r\nme to see them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRaces? What races?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes. I had forgotten. Do you\r\nreally mean that you want to see them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course! They are great fun, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are in a mood for great fun? Well, there is plenty of time. The\r\nSecond Division is not rowed till half-past four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Second Division? Why not take me to the First?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not rowed till six.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t this rather an odd arrangement?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt. But Oxford never pretended to be strong in mathematics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s not yet three!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Zuleika, with a woebegone stare at the\r\nclock. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to be done in the meantime?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm not I sufficiently diverting?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Duke bitterly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite candidly, no. Have you any friend lodging with you here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne, overhead. A man named Noaks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA small man, with spectacles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery small, with very large spectacles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was pointed out to me yesterday, as I was driving from the Station\r\n... No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I want to meet him. What can you have in common\r\nwith him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne frailty, at least: he, too, Miss Dobson, loves you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut of course he does. He saw me drive past. Very few of the others,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said, rising and shaking herself, \xe2\x80\x9chave set eyes on me. Do let us go\r\nout and look at the Colleges. I do need change of scene. If you were a\r\ndoctor, you would have prescribed that long ago. It is very bad for me\r\nto be here, a kind of Cinderella, moping over the ashes of my love for\r\nyou. Where is your hat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLooking round, she caught sight of herself in the glass. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncried, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a fright I do look! I must never be seen like this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look very beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t. That is a lover\xe2\x80\x99s illusion. You yourself told me that this\r\ntartan was perfectly hideous. There was no need to tell me that. I\r\ncame thus because I was coming to see you. I chose this frock in the\r\ndeliberate fear that you, if I made myself presentable, might succumb at\r\nsecond sight of me. I would have sent out for a sack and dressed myself\r\nin that, I would have blacked my face all over with burnt cork, only I\r\nwas afraid of being mobbed on the way to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so, you would but have been mobbed for your incorrigible beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy beauty! How I hate it!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Zuleika. \xe2\x80\x9cStill, here it is, and I\r\nmust needs make the best of it. Come! Take me to Judas. I will change my\r\nthings. Then I shall be fit for the races.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs these two emerged, side by side, into the street, the Emperors\r\nexchanged stony sidelong glances. For they saw the more than normal\r\npallor of the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s face, and something very like desperation in his\r\neyes. They saw the tragedy progressing to its foreseen close. Unable to\r\nstay its course, they were grimly fascinated now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with\r\ntheir bones.\xe2\x80\x9d At any rate, the sinner has a better chance than the saint\r\nof being hereafter remembered. We, in whom original sin preponderates,\r\nfind him easier to understand. He is near to us, clear to us. The saint\r\nis remote, dim. A very great saint may, of course, be remembered through\r\nsome sheer force of originality in him; and then the very mystery that\r\ninvolves him for us makes him the harder to forget: he haunts us the\r\nmore surely because we shall never understand him. But the ordinary\r\nsaints grow faint to posterity; whilst quite ordinary sinners pass\r\nvividly down the ages.\r\n\r\nOf the disciples of Jesus, which is he that is most often remembered\r\nand cited by us? Not the disciple whom Jesus loved; neither of the\r\nBoanerges, nor any other of them who so steadfastly followed Him and\r\nserved Him; but the disciple who betrayed Him for thirty pieces of\r\nsilver. Judas Iscariot it is who outstands, overshadowing those\r\nother fishermen. And perhaps it was by reason of this precedence that\r\nChristopher Whitrid, Knight, in the reign of Henry VI., gave the name of\r\nJudas to the College which he had founded. Or perhaps it was because he\r\nfelt that in a Christian community not even the meanest and basest of\r\nmen should be accounted beneath contempt, beyond redemption.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, thus he named his foundation. And, though for Oxford men\r\nthe savour of the name itself has long evaporated through its local\r\nconnexion, many things show that for the Founder himself it was no empty\r\nvocable. In a niche above the gate stands a rudely carved statue\r\nof Judas, holding a money-bag in his right hand. Among the original\r\nstatutes of the College is one by which the Bursar is enjoined to\r\ndistribute in Passion Week thirty pieces of silver among the needier\r\nscholars \xe2\x80\x9cfor saike of atonynge.\xe2\x80\x9d The meadow adjoining the back of the\r\nCollege has been called from time immemorial \xe2\x80\x9cthe Potter\xe2\x80\x99s Field.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthe name of Salt Cellar is not less ancient and significant.\r\n\r\nSalt Cellar, that grey and green quadrangle visible from the room\r\nassigned to Zuleika, is very beautiful, as I have said. So tranquil is\r\nit as to seem remote not merely from the world, but even from Oxford, so\r\ndeeply is it hidden away in the core of Oxford\xe2\x80\x99s heart. So tranquil\r\nis it, one would guess that nothing had ever happened in it. For five\r\ncenturies these walls have stood, and during that time have beheld, one\r\nwould say, no sight less seemly than the good work of weeding, mowing,\r\nrolling, that has made, at length, so exemplary the lawn. These\r\ncloisters that grace the south and east sides--five centuries have\r\npassed through them, leaving in them no echo, leaving on them no\r\nsign, of all that the outer world, for good or evil, has been doing so\r\nfiercely, so raucously.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, if you are versed in the antiquities of Oxford, you know that\r\nthis small, still quadrangle has played its part in the rough-and-tumble\r\nof history, and has been the background of high passions and strange\r\nfates. The sun-dial in its midst has told the hours to more than one\r\nbygone King. Charles I. lay for twelve nights in Judas; and it was here,\r\nin this very quadrangle, that he heard from the lips of a breathless and\r\nblood-stained messenger the news of Chalgrove Field. Sixty years later,\r\nJames, his son, came hither, black with threats, and from one of the\r\nhind-windows of the Warden\xe2\x80\x99s house--maybe, from the very room where now\r\nZuleika was changing her frock--addressed the Fellows, and presented\r\nto them the Papist by him chosen to be their Warden, instead of the\r\nProtestant whom they had elected. They were not of so stern a stuff as\r\nthe Fellows of Magdalen, who, despite His Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s menaces, had just\r\nrejected Bishop Farmer. The Papist was elected, there and then, al\r\nfresco, without dissent. Cannot one see them, these Fellows of Judas,\r\nhuddled together round the sun-dial, like so many sheep in a storm? The\r\nKing\xe2\x80\x99s wrath, according to a contemporary record, was so appeased by\r\ntheir pliancy that he deigned to lie for two nights in Judas, and at\r\na grand refection in Hall \xe2\x80\x9cwas gracious and merrie.\xe2\x80\x9d Perhaps it was in\r\nlingering gratitude for such patronage that Judas remained so pious to\r\nhis memory even after smug Herrenhausen had been dumped down on us for\r\never. Certainly, of all the Colleges none was more ardent than Judas for\r\nJames Stuart. Thither it was that young Sir Harry Esson led, under cover\r\nof night, three-score recruits whom he had enlisted in the surrounding\r\nvillages. The cloisters of Salt Cellar were piled with arms and stores;\r\nand on its grass--its sacred grass!--the squad was incessantly drilled,\r\nagainst the good day when Ormond should land his men in Devon. For a\r\nwhole month Salt Cellar was a secret camp. But somehow, at length--woe\r\nto \xe2\x80\x9clost causes and impossible loyalties\xe2\x80\x9d--Herrenhausen had wind of\r\nit; and one night, when the soldiers of the white cockade lay snoring\r\nbeneath the stars, stealthily the white-faced Warden unbarred his\r\npostern--that very postern through which now Zuleika had passed on the\r\nway to her bedroom--and stealthily through it, one by one on tip-toe,\r\ncame the King\xe2\x80\x99s foot-guards. Not many shots rang out, nor many swords\r\nclashed, in the night air, before the trick was won for law and order.\r\nMost of the rebels were overpowered in their sleep; and those who had\r\ntime to snatch arms were too dazed to make good resistance. Sir Harry\r\nEsson himself was the only one who did not live to be hanged. He had\r\nsprung up alert, sword in hand, at the first alarm, setting his back to\r\nthe cloisters. There he fought calmly, ferociously, till a bullet went\r\nthrough his chest. \xe2\x80\x9cBy God, this College is well-named!\xe2\x80\x9d were the words\r\nhe uttered as he fell forward and died.\r\n\r\nComparatively tame was the scene now being enacted in this place. The\r\nDuke, with bowed head, was pacing the path between the lawn and the\r\ncloisters. Two other undergraduates stood watching him, whispering\r\nto each other, under the archway that leads to the Front Quadrangle.\r\nPresently, in a sheepish way, they approached him. He halted and looked\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered the spokesman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Duke. Both youths were slightly acquainted with him;\r\nbut he was not used to being spoken to by those whom he had not first\r\naddressed. Moreover, he was loth to be thus disturbed in his sombre\r\nreverie. His manner was not encouraging.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it a lovely day for the Eights?\xe2\x80\x9d faltered the spokesman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI conceive,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duke said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you hold back some other question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe spokesman smiled weakly. Nudged by the other, he muttered \xe2\x80\x9cAsk him\r\nyourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke diverted his gaze to the other, who, with an angry look at the\r\none, cleared his throat, and said \xe2\x80\x9cI was going to ask if you thought\r\nMiss Dobson would come and have luncheon with me to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sister of mine will be there,\xe2\x80\x9d explained the one, knowing the Duke to\r\nbe a precisian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are acquainted with Miss Dobson, a direct invitation should be\r\nsent to her,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are not--\xe2\x80\x9d The aposiopesis was icy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other of the two, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is just the\r\ndifficulty. I AM acquainted with her. But is she acquainted with ME? I\r\nmet her at breakfast this morning, at the Warden\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo did I,\xe2\x80\x9d added the one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she--well,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the other, \xe2\x80\x9cshe didn\xe2\x80\x99t take much notice of\r\nus. She seemed to be in a sort of dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the Duke, with melancholy interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only time she opened her lips,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, \xe2\x80\x9cwas when she asked\r\nus whether we took tea or coffee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe put hot milk in my tea,\xe2\x80\x9d volunteered the one, \xe2\x80\x9cand upset the cup\r\nover my hand, and smiled vaguely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd smiled vaguely,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed the Duke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe left us long before the marmalade stage,\xe2\x80\x9d said the one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout a word,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout a glance?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Duke. It was testified by the one and the\r\nother that there had been not so much as a glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless,\xe2\x80\x9d the disingenuous Duke said, \xe2\x80\x9cshe had a headache... Was she\r\npale?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery pale,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA healthy pallor,\xe2\x80\x9d qualified the other, who was a constant reader of\r\nnovels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she look,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duke inquired, \xe2\x80\x9cas if she had spent a sleepless\r\nnight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was the impression made on both.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet she did not seem listless or unhappy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo, they would not go so far as to say that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, were her eyes of an almost unnatural brilliance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite unnatural,\xe2\x80\x9d confessed the one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwin stars,\xe2\x80\x9d interpolated the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she, in fact, seem to be consumed by some inward rapture?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, now they came to think of it, this was exactly how she HAD seemed.\r\n\r\nIt was sweet, it was bitter, for the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember,\xe2\x80\x9d Zuleika had\r\nsaid to him, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing that happened to me this morning till I found\r\nmyself at your door.\xe2\x80\x9d It was bitter-sweet to have that outline filled in\r\nby these artless pencils. No, it was only bitter, to be, at his time of\r\nlife, living in the past.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe purpose of your tattle?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked coldly.\r\n\r\nThe two youths hurried to the point from which he had diverted them.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen she went by with you just now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the one, \xe2\x80\x9cshe evidently\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know us from Adam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I had so hoped to ask her to luncheon,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we wondered if you would re-introduce us. And then perhaps...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. The Duke was touched to kindness for these\r\nfellow-lovers. He would fain preserve them from the anguish that beset\r\nhimself. So humanising is sorrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are in love with Miss Dobson?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nBoth nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will in time be thankful to me for not affording\r\nyou further traffic with that lady. To love and be scorned--does Fate\r\nhold for us a greater inconvenience? You think I beg the question? Let\r\nme tell you that I, too, love Miss Dobson, and that she scorns me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo the implied question \xe2\x80\x9cWhat chance would there be for you?\xe2\x80\x9d the reply\r\nwas obvious.\r\n\r\nAmazed, abashed, the two youths turned on their heels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me, in justice to myself, correct an\r\ninference you may have drawn. It is not by reason of any defect in\r\nmyself, perceived or imagined, that Miss Dobson scorns me. She scorns me\r\nsimply because I love her. All who love her she scorns. To see her is\r\nto love her. Therefore shut your eyes to her. Strictly exclude her from\r\nyour horizon. Ignore her. Will you do this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will try,\xe2\x80\x9d said the one, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you very much,\xe2\x80\x9d added the other.\r\n\r\nThe Duke watched them out of sight. He wished he could take the good\r\nadvice he had given them... Suppose he did take it! Suppose he went\r\nto the Bursar, obtained an exeat, fled straight to London! What just\r\nhumiliation for Zuleika to come down and find her captive gone! He\r\npictured her staring around the quadrangle, ranging the cloisters,\r\ncalling to him. He pictured her rustling to the gate of the College,\r\ninquiring at the porter\xe2\x80\x99s lodge. \xe2\x80\x9cHis Grace, Miss, he passed through a\r\nminute ago. He\xe2\x80\x99s going down this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYet, even while his fancy luxuriated in this scheme, he well knew that\r\nhe would not accomplish anything of the kind--knew well that he would\r\nwait here humbly, eagerly, even though Zuleika lingered over her toilet\r\ntill crack o\xe2\x80\x99 doom. He had no desire that was not centred in her. Take\r\naway his love for her, and what remained? Nothing--though only in the\r\npast twenty-four hours had this love been added to him. Ah, why had\r\nhe ever seen her? He thought of his past, its cold splendour and\r\ninsouciance. But he knew that for him there was no returning. His boats\r\nwere burnt. The Cytherean babes had set their torches to that flotilla,\r\nand it had blazed like match-wood. On the isle of the enchantress he was\r\nstranded for ever. For ever stranded on the isle of an enchantress who\r\nwould have nothing to do with him! What, he wondered, should be done in\r\nso piteous a quandary? There seemed to be two courses. One was to pine\r\nslowly and painfully away. The other...\r\n\r\nAcademically, the Duke had often reasoned that a man for whom life holds\r\nno chance of happiness cannot too quickly shake life off. Now, of a\r\nsudden, there was for that theory a vivid application.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether \xe2\x80\x98tis nobler in the mind to suffer\xe2\x80\x9d was not a point by which he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmore an antique Roman than a Dane,\xe2\x80\x9d was at all troubled. Never had he\r\ngiven ear to that cackle which is called Public Opinion. The judgment\r\nof his peers--this, he had often told himself, was the sole arbitrage he\r\ncould submit to; but then, who was to be on the bench? Peerless, he was\r\nirresponsible--the captain of his soul, the despot of his future. No\r\ninjunction but from himself would he bow to; and his own injunctions--so\r\nlittle Danish was he--had always been peremptory and lucid. Lucid and\r\nperemptory, now, the command he issued to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo sorry to have been so long,\xe2\x80\x9d carolled a voice from above. The Duke\r\nlooked up. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m all but ready,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zuleika at her window.\r\n\r\nThat brief apparition changed the colour of his resolve. He realised\r\nthat to die for love of this lady would be no mere measure of\r\nprecaution, or counsel of despair. It would be in itself a passionate\r\nindulgence--a fiery rapture, not to be foregone. What better could\r\nhe ask than to die for his love? Poor indeed seemed to him now\r\nthe sacrament of marriage beside the sacrament of death. Death was\r\nincomparably the greater, the finer soul. Death was the one true bridal.\r\n\r\nHe flung back his head, spread wide his arms, quickened his pace almost\r\nto running speed. Ah, he would win his bride before the setting of the\r\nsun. He knew not by what means he would win her. Enough that even now,\r\nfull-hearted, fleet-footed, he was on his way to her, and that she heard\r\nhim coming.\r\n\r\nWhen Zuleika, a vision in vaporous white, came out through the postern,\r\nshe wondered why he was walking at so remarkable a pace. To him, wildly\r\nexpressing in his movement the thought within him, she appeared as his\r\nawful bride. With a cry of joy, he bounded towards her, and would have\r\ncaught her in his arms, had she not stepped nimbly aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a mistake--an idiotic\r\nmistake of identity. I thought you were...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZuleika, rigid, asked \xe2\x80\x9cHave I many doubles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know well that in all the world is none so blest as to be like you.\r\nI can only say that I was over-wrought. I can only say that it shall not\r\noccur again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was very angry indeed. Of his penitence there could be no doubt. But\r\nthere are outrages for which no penitence can atone. This seemed to be\r\none of them. Her first impulse was to dismiss the Duke forthwith and for\r\never. But she wanted to show herself at the races. And she could not go\r\nalone. And except the Duke there was no one to take her. True, there was\r\nthe concert to-night; and she could show herself there to advantage; but\r\nshe wanted ALL Oxford to see her--see her NOW.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am forgiven?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. In her, I am afraid, self-respect outweighed\r\ncharity. \xe2\x80\x9cI will try,\xe2\x80\x9d she said merely, \xe2\x80\x9cto forget what you have done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Motioning him to her side, she opened her parasol, and signified her\r\nreadiness to start.\r\n\r\nThey passed together across the vast gravelled expanse of the Front\r\nQuadrangle. In the porch of the College there were, as usual, some\r\nchained-up dogs, patiently awaiting their masters. Zuleika, of course,\r\ndid not care for dogs. One has never known a good man to whom dogs were\r\nnot dear; but many of the best women have no such fondness. You will\r\nfind that the woman who is really kind to dogs is always one who has\r\nfailed to inspire sympathy in men. For the attractive woman, dogs are\r\nmere dumb and restless brutes--possibly dangerous, certainly soulless.\r\nYet will coquetry teach her to caress any dog in the presence of a\r\nman enslaved by her. Even Zuleika, it seems, was not above this rather\r\nobvious device for awaking envy. Be sure she did not at all like the\r\nlook of the very big bulldog who was squatting outside the porter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlodge. Perhaps, but for her present anger, she would not have stooped\r\nendearingly down to him, as she did, cooing over him and trying to pat\r\nhis head. Alas, her pretty act was a failure. The bulldog cowered away\r\nfrom her, horrifically grimacing. This was strange. Like the majority\r\nof his breed, Corker (for such was his name) had ever been wistful to\r\nbe noticed by any one--effusively grateful for every word or pat, an\r\never-ready wagger and nuzzler, to none ineffable. No beggar, no burglar,\r\nhad ever been rebuffed by this catholic beast. But he drew the line at\r\nZuleika.\r\n\r\nSeldom is even a fierce bulldog heard to growl. Yet Corker growled at\r\nZuleika.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThe Duke did not try to break the stony silence in which Zuleika walked.\r\nHer displeasure was a luxury to him, for it was so soon to be dispelled.\r\nA little while, and she would be hating herself for her pettiness. Here\r\nwas he, going to die for her; and here was she, blaming him for a breach\r\nof manners. Decidedly, the slave had the whip-hand. He stole a sidelong\r\nlook at her, and could not repress a smile. His features quickly\r\ncomposed themselves. The Triumph of Death must not be handled as a\r\ncheap score. He wanted to die because he would thereby so poignantly\r\nconsummate his love, express it so completely, once and for all...\r\nAnd she--who could say that she, knowing what he had done, might not,\r\nillogically, come to love him? Perhaps she would devote her life to\r\nmourning him. He saw her bending over his tomb, in beautiful humble\r\ncurves, under a starless sky, watering the violets with her tears.\r\n\r\nShades of Novalis and Friedrich Schlegel and other despicable\r\nmaunderers! He brushed them aside. He would be practical. The point was,\r\nwhen and how to die? Time: the sooner the better. Manner:.. less easy to\r\ndetermine. He must not die horribly, nor without dignity. The manner of\r\nthe Roman philosophers? But the only kind of bath which an undergraduate\r\ncan command is a hip-bath. Stay! there was the river. Drowning (he had\r\noften heard) was a rather pleasant sensation. And to the river he was\r\neven now on his way.\r\n\r\nIt troubled him that he could swim. Twice, indeed, from his yacht,\r\nhe had swum the Hellespont. And how about the animal instinct of\r\nself-preservation, strong even in despair? No matter! His soul\xe2\x80\x99s set\r\npurpose would subdue that. The law of gravitation that brings one to the\r\nsurface? There his very skill in swimming would help him. He would swim\r\nunder water, along the river-bed, swim till he found weeds to cling to,\r\nweird strong weeds that he would coil round him, exulting faintly...\r\n\r\nAs they turned into Radcliffe Square, the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s ear caught the sound of\r\na far-distant gun. He started, and looked up at the clock of St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nHalf-past four! The boats had started.\r\n\r\nHe had heard that whenever a woman was to blame for a disappointment,\r\nthe best way to avoid a scene was to inculpate oneself. He did not\r\nwish Zuleika to store up yet more material for penitence. And so \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nsorry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat gun--did you hear it? It was the signal for the\r\nrace. I shall never forgive myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we shan\xe2\x80\x99t see the race at all?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Zuleika.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be over, alas, before we are near the river. All the people\r\nwill be coming back through the meadows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us meet them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeet a torrent? Let us have tea in my rooms and go down quietly for the\r\nother Division.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go straight on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThrough the square, across the High, down Grove Street, they passed.\r\nThe Duke looked up at the tower of Merton, \xe2\x80\x9cos oupot authis alla nyn\r\npaunstaton.\xe2\x80\x9d Strange that to-night it would still be standing here,\r\nin all its sober and solid beauty--still be gazing, over the roofs and\r\nchimneys, at the tower of Magdalen, its rightful bride. Through untold\r\ncenturies of the future it would stand thus, gaze thus. He winced.\r\nOxford walls have a way of belittling us; and the Duke was loth to\r\nregard his doom as trivial.\r\n\r\nAye, by all minerals we are mocked. Vegetables, yearly deciduous, are\r\nfar more sympathetic. The lilac and laburnum, making lovely now the\r\nrailed pathway to Christ Church meadow, were all a-swaying and a-nodding\r\nto the Duke as he passed by. \xe2\x80\x9cAdieu, adieu, your Grace,\xe2\x80\x9d they were\r\nwhispering. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are very sorry for you--very sorry indeed. We never\r\ndared suppose you would predecease us. We think your death a very great\r\ntragedy. Adieu! Perhaps we shall meet in another world--that is, if the\r\nmembers of the animal kingdom have immortal souls, as we have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke was little versed in their language; yet, as he passed between\r\nthese gently garrulous blooms, he caught at least the drift of their\r\nsalutation, and smiled a vague but courteous acknowledgment, to the\r\nright and the left alternately, creating a very favourable impression.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, the young elms lining the straight way to the barges had seen\r\nhim coming; but any whispers of their leaves were lost in the murmur of\r\nthe crowd returning from the race. Here, at length, came the torrent\r\nof which the Duke had spoken; and Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s heart rose at it. Here was\r\nOxford! From side to side the avenue was filled with a dense procession\r\nof youths--youths interspersed with maidens whose parasols were as\r\nflotsam and jetsam on a seething current of straw hats. Zuleika neither\r\nquickened nor slackened her advance. But brightlier and brightlier shone\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\nThe vanguard of the procession was pausing now, swaying, breaking at\r\nsight of her. She passed, imperial, through the way cloven for her. All\r\na-down the avenue, the throng parted as though some great invisible\r\ncomb were being drawn through it. The few youths who had already\r\nseen Zuleika, and by whom her beauty had been bruited throughout the\r\nUniversity, were lost in a new wonder, so incomparably fairer was she\r\nthan the remembered vision. And the rest hardly recognised her from the\r\ndescriptions, so incomparably fairer was the reality than the hope.\r\n\r\nShe passed among them. None questioned the worthiness of her escort.\r\nCould I give you better proof the awe in which our Duke was held? Any\r\nman is glad to be seen escorting a very pretty woman. He thinks it adds\r\nto his prestige. Whereas, in point of fact, his fellow-men are saying\r\nmerely \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that appalling fellow with her?\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cWhy does she go about\r\nwith that ass So-and-So?\xe2\x80\x9d Such cavil may in part be envy. But it is a\r\nfact that no man, howsoever graced, can shine in juxtaposition to a very\r\npretty woman. The Duke himself cut a poor figure beside Zuleika. Yet not\r\none of all the undergraduates felt she could have made a wiser choice.\r\n\r\nShe swept among them. Her own intrinsic radiance was not all that\r\nflashed from her. She was a moving reflector and refractor of all the\r\nrays of all the eyes that mankind had turned on her. Her mien told the\r\nstory of her days. Bright eyes, light feet--she trod erect from a vista\r\nwhose glare was dazzling to all beholders. She swept among them, a\r\nmiracle, overwhelming, breath-bereaving. Nothing at all like her had\r\never been seen in Oxford.\r\n\r\nMainly architectural, the beauties of Oxford. True, the place is no\r\nlonger one-sexed. There are the virguncules of Somerville and Lady\r\nMargaret\xe2\x80\x99s Hall; but beauty and the lust for learning have yet to be\r\nallied. There are the innumerable wives and daughters around the Parks,\r\nrunning in and out of their little red-brick villas; but the indignant\r\nshade of celibacy seems to have called down on the dons a Nemesis which\r\nprecludes them from either marrying beauty or begetting it. (From the\r\nWarden\xe2\x80\x99s son, that unhappy curate, Zuleika inherited no tittle of\r\nher charm. Some of it, there is no doubt, she did inherit from the\r\ncircus-rider who was her mother.)\r\n\r\nBut the casual feminine visitors? Well, the sisters and cousins of an\r\nundergraduate seldom seem more passable to his comrades than to himself.\r\nAltogether, the instinct of sex is not pandered to in Oxford. It is not,\r\nhowever, as it may once have been, dormant. The modern importation of\r\nsamples of femininity serves to keep it alert, though not to gratify it.\r\nA like result is achieved by another modern development--photography.\r\nThe undergraduate may, and usually does, surround himself with\r\nphotographs of pretty ladies known to the public. A phantom harem! Yet\r\nthe houris have an effect on their sultan. Surrounded both by plain\r\nwomen of flesh and blood and by beauteous women on pasteboard, the\r\nundergraduate is the easiest victim of living loveliness--is as a fire\r\never well and truly laid, amenable to a spark. And if the spark be such\r\na flaring torch as Zuleika?--marvel not, reader, at the conflagration.\r\n\r\nNot only was the whole throng of youths drawing asunder before her:\r\nmuch of it, as she passed, was forming up in her wake. Thus, with the\r\nconfluence of two masses--one coming away from the river, the other\r\nreturning to it--chaos seethed around her and the Duke before they were\r\nhalf-way along the avenue. Behind them, and on either side of them, the\r\npeople were crushed inextricably together, swaying and surging this way\r\nand that. \xe2\x80\x9cHelp!\xe2\x80\x9d cried many a shrill feminine voice. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t push!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLet\r\nme out!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou brute!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSave me, save me!\xe2\x80\x9d Many ladies fainted, whilst\r\ntheir escorts, supporting them and protecting them as best they could,\r\npeered over the heads of their fellows for one glimpse of the divine\r\nMiss Dobson. Yet for her and the Duke, in the midst of the terrific\r\ncompress, there was space enough. In front of them, as by a miracle\r\nof deference, a way still cleared itself. They reached the end of the\r\navenue without a pause in their measured progress. Nor even when they\r\nturned to the left, along the rather narrow path beside the barges, was\r\nthere any obstacle to their advance. Passing evenly forward, they alone\r\nwere cool, unhustled, undishevelled.\r\n\r\nThe Duke was so rapt in his private thoughts that he was hardly\r\nconscious of the strange scene. And as for Zuleika, she, as well she\r\nmight be, was in the very best of good humours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lot of house-boats!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to take me on\r\nto one of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke started. Already they were alongside the Judas barge. \xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis our goal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stepped through the gate of the railings, out upon the plank, and\r\noffered her his hand.\r\n\r\nShe looked back. The young men in the vanguard were crushing their\r\nshoulders against the row behind them, to stay the oncoming host. She\r\nhad half a mind to go back through the midst of them; but she really did\r\nwant her tea, and she followed the Duke on to the barge, and under his\r\nauspices climbed the steps to the roof.\r\n\r\nIt looked very cool and gay, this roof, under its awning of red and\r\nwhite stripes. Nests of red and white flowers depended along either side\r\nof it. Zuleika moved to the side which commanded a view of the bank. She\r\nleaned her arms on the balustrade, and gazed down.\r\n\r\nThe crowd stretched as far as she could see--a vista of faces upturned\r\nto her. Suddenly it hove forward. Its vanguard was swept irresistibly\r\npast the barge--swept by the desire of the rest to see her at closer\r\nquarters. Such was the impetus that the vision for each man was but\r\na lightning-flash: he was whirled past, struggling, almost before his\r\nbrain took the message of his eyes.\r\n\r\nThose who were Judas men made frantic efforts to board the barge, trying\r\nto hurl themselves through the gate in the railings; but they were swept\r\nvainly on.\r\n\r\nPresently the torrent began to slacken, became a mere river, a mere\r\nprocession of youths staring up rather shyly.\r\n\r\nBefore the last stragglers had marched by, Zuleika moved away to the\r\nother side of the roof, and, after a glance at the sunlit river,\r\nsank into one of the wicker chairs, and asked the Duke to look less\r\ndisagreeable and to give her some tea.\r\n\r\nAmong others hovering near the little buffet were the two youths whose\r\nparley with the Duke I have recorded.\r\n\r\nZuleika was aware of the special persistence of their gaze. When the\r\nDuke came back with her cup, she asked him who they were. He replied,\r\ntruthfully enough, that their names were unknown to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cask them their names, and introduce them to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, sinking into the chair beside her. \xe2\x80\x9cThat I shall\r\nnot do. I am your victim: not your pander. Those two men stand on the\r\nthreshold of a possibly useful and agreeable career. I am not going to\r\ntrip them up for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zuleika, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are very polite. Certainly you\r\nare foolish. It is natural for boys to fall in love. If these two are\r\nin love with me, why not let them talk to me? It were an experience on\r\nwhich they would always look back with romantic pleasure. They may never\r\nsee me again. Why grudge them this little thing?\xe2\x80\x9d She sipped her tea.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for tripping them up on a threshold--that is all nonsense. What harm\r\nhas unrequited love ever done to anybody?\xe2\x80\x9d She laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at ME!\r\nWhen I came to your rooms this morning, thinking I loved in vain, did I\r\nseem one jot the worse for it? Did I look different?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou looked, I am bound to say, nobler, more spiritual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore spiritual?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean I looked tired or ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you seemed quite fresh. But then, you are singular. You are no\r\ncriterion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean you can\xe2\x80\x99t judge those two young men by me? Well, I am only a\r\nwoman, of course. I have heard of women, no longer young, wasting away\r\nbecause no man loved them. I have often heard of a young woman fretting\r\nbecause some particular young man didn\xe2\x80\x99t love her. But I never heard of\r\nher wasting away. Certainly a young man doesn\xe2\x80\x99t waste away for love of\r\nsome particular young woman. He very soon makes love to some other one.\r\nIf his be an ardent nature, the quicker his transition. All the most\r\nardent of my past adorers have married. Will you put my cup down,\r\nplease?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPast?\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the Duke, as he placed her cup on the floor. \xe2\x80\x9cHave any of\r\nyour lovers ceased to love you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh no, no; not in retrospect. I remain their ideal, and all that, of\r\ncourse. They cherish the thought of me. They see the world in terms of\r\nme. But I am an inspiration, not an obsession; a glow, not a blight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in the love that corrodes, the love that ruins?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Zuleika.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have never dipped into the Greek pastoral poets, nor sampled the\r\nElizabethan sonneteers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, never. You will think me lamentably crude: my experience of life\r\nhas been drawn from life itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet often you talk as though you had read rather much. Your way of\r\nspeech has what is called \xe2\x80\x98the literary flavour\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that is an unfortunate trick which I caught from a writer, a Mr.\r\nBeerbohm, who once sat next to me at dinner somewhere. I can\xe2\x80\x99t break\r\nmyself of it. I assure you I hardly ever open a book. Of life, though,\r\nmy experience has been very wide. Brief? But I suppose the soul of man\r\nduring the past two or three years has been much as it was in the reign\r\nof Queen Elizabeth and of--whoever it was that reigned over the Greek\r\npastures. And I daresay the modern poets are making the same old silly\r\ndistortions. But forgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d she added gently, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps you yourself\r\nare a poet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly since yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Duke (not less unfairly to himself\r\nthan to Roger Newdigate and Thomas Gaisford). And he felt he was\r\nespecially a dramatic poet. All the while that she had been sitting by\r\nhim here, talking so glibly, looking so straight into his eyes, flashing\r\nat him so many pretty gestures, it was the sense of tragic irony\r\nthat prevailed in him--that sense which had stirred in him, and been\r\nrepressed, on the way from Judas. He knew that she was making her effect\r\nconsciously for the other young men by whom the roof of the barge was\r\nnow thronged. Him alone she seemed to observe. By her manner, she might\r\nhave seemed to be making love to him. He envied the men she was so\r\ndeliberately making envious--the men whom, in her undertone to him, she\r\nwas really addressing. But he did take comfort in the irony. Though she\r\nused him as a stalking-horse, he, after all, was playing with her as a\r\ncat plays with a mouse. While she chattered on, without an inkling that\r\nhe was no ordinary lover, and coaxing him to present two quite ordinary\r\nyoung men to her, he held over her the revelation that he for love of\r\nher was about to die.\r\n\r\nAnd, while he drank in the radiance of her beauty, he heard her\r\nchattering on. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you see,\xe2\x80\x9d she was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cit couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do those young\r\nmen any harm. Suppose unrequited love IS anguish: isn\xe2\x80\x99t the discipline\r\nwholesome? Suppose I AM a sort of furnace: shan\xe2\x80\x99t I purge, refine,\r\ntemper? Those two boys are but scorched from here. That is horrid; and\r\nwhat good will it do them?\xe2\x80\x9d She laid a hand on his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cCast them into\r\nthe furnace for their own sake, dear Duke! Or cast one of them, or,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded, glancing round at the throng, \xe2\x80\x9cany one of these others!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor their own sake?\xe2\x80\x9d he echoed, withdrawing his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you were not,\r\nas the whole world knows you to be, perfectly respectable, there might\r\nbe something in what you say. But as it is, you can but be an engine for\r\nmischief; and your sophistries leave me unmoved. I shall certainly keep\r\nyou to myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zuleika, with an ugly petulance that crowned the\r\nirony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo long as I live,\xe2\x80\x9d uttered the Duke, in a level voice, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will\r\naddress no man but me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your prophecy is to be fulfilled,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Zuleika, rising from her\r\nchair, \xe2\x80\x9cyour last moment is at hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, rising too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, awed by something in his tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean what I say: that my last moment is at hand.\xe2\x80\x9d He withdrew\r\nhis eyes from hers, and, leaning his elbows on the balustrade, gazed\r\nthoughtfully at the river. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I am dead,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, over his\r\nshoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will find these fellows rather coy of your advances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the first time since his avowal of his love for her, Zuleika found\r\nherself genuinely interested in him. A suspicion of his meaning had\r\nflashed through her soul.--But no! surely he could not mean THAT! It\r\nmust have been a metaphor merely. And yet, something in his eyes... She\r\nleaned beside him. Her shoulder touched his. She gazed questioningly at\r\nhim. He did not turn his face to her. He gazed at the sunlit river.\r\n\r\nThe Judas Eight had just embarked for their voyage to the\r\nstarting-point. Standing on the edge of the raft that makes a floating\r\nplatform for the barge, William, the hoary bargee, was pushing them off\r\nwith his boat-hook, wishing them luck with deferential familiarity.\r\nThe raft was thronged with Old Judasians--mostly clergymen--who were\r\nshouting hearty hortations, and evidently trying not to appear so old\r\nas they felt--or rather, not to appear so startlingly old as their\r\ncontemporaries looked to them. It occurred to the Duke as a strange\r\nthing, and a thing to be glad of, that he, in this world, would never be\r\nan Old Judasian. Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder pressed his. He thrilled not at all.\r\nTo all intents, he was dead already.\r\n\r\nThe enormous eight young men in the thread-like skiff--the skiff that\r\nwould scarce have seemed an adequate vehicle for the tiny \xe2\x80\x9ccox\xe2\x80\x9d who sat\r\nfacing them--were staring up at Zuleika with that uniformity of impulse\r\nwhich, in another direction, had enabled them to bump a boat on two of\r\nthe previous \xe2\x80\x9cnights.\xe2\x80\x9d If to-night they bumped the next boat, Univ.,\r\nthen would Judas be three places \xe2\x80\x9cup\xe2\x80\x9d on the river; and to-morrow Judas\r\nwould have a Bump Supper. Furthermore, if Univ. were bumped to-night,\r\nMagdalen might be bumped to-morrow. Then would Judas, for the first\r\ntime in history, be head of the river. Oh tremulous hope! Yet, for\r\nthe moment, these eight young men seemed to have forgotten the awful\r\nresponsibility that rested on their over-developed shoulders. Their\r\nhearts, already strained by rowing, had been transfixed this afternoon\r\nby Eros\xe2\x80\x99 darts. All of them had seen Zuleika as she came down to the\r\nriver; and now they sat gaping up at her, fumbling with their oars. The\r\ntiny cox gaped too; but he it was who first recalled duty. With piping\r\nadjurations he brought the giants back to their senses. The boat moved\r\naway down stream, with a fairly steady stroke.\r\n\r\nNot in a day can the traditions of Oxford be sent spinning. From all the\r\nbarges the usual punt-loads of young men were being ferried across\r\nto the towing-path--young men naked of knee, armed with rattles,\r\npost-horns, motor-hooters, gongs, and other instruments of clangour.\r\nThough Zuleika filled their thoughts, they hurried along the\r\ntowing-path, as by custom, to the starting-point.\r\n\r\nShe, meanwhile, had not taken her eyes off the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s profile. Nor\r\nhad she dared, for fear of disappointment, to ask him just what he had\r\nmeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll these men,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated dreamily, \xe2\x80\x9cwill be coy of your advances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n It seemed to him a good thing that his death, his awful example, would\r\ndisinfatuate his fellow alumni. He had never been conscious of\r\npublic spirit. He had lived for himself alone. Love had come to him\r\nyesternight, and to-day had waked in him a sympathy with mankind. It\r\nwas a fine thing to be a saviour. It was splendid to be human. He looked\r\nquickly round to her who had wrought this change in him.\r\n\r\nBut the loveliest face in all the world will not please you if you see\r\nit suddenly, eye to eye, at a distance of half an inch from your own.\r\nIt was thus that the Duke saw Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s: a monstrous deliquium a-glare.\r\nOnly for the fraction of an instant, though. Recoiling, he beheld the\r\nloveliness that he knew--more adorably vivid now in its look of eager\r\nquestioning. And in his every fibre he thrilled to her. Even so had she\r\ngazed at him last night, this morning. Aye, now as then, her soul was\r\nfull of him. He had recaptured, not her love, but his power to please\r\nher. It was enough. He bowed his head; and \xe2\x80\x9cMoriturus te saluto\xe2\x80\x9d were\r\nthe words formed silently by his lips. He was glad that his death would\r\nbe a public service to the University. But the salutary lesson of\r\nwhat the newspapers would call his \xe2\x80\x9crash act\xe2\x80\x9d was, after all, only a\r\nside-issue. The great thing, the prospect that flushed his cheek, was\r\nthe consummation of his own love, for its own sake, by his own death.\r\nAnd, as he met her gaze, the question that had already flitted through\r\nhis brain found a faltering utterance; and \xe2\x80\x9cShall you mourn me?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked her.\r\n\r\nBut she would have no ellipses. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwhispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you not know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce and for all: you cannot love me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSlowly she shook her head. The black pearl and the pink, quivering, gave\r\nstress to her ultimatum. But the violet of her eyes was all but hidden\r\nby the dilation of her pupils.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I shall have died, deeming life a vain\r\nthing without you, will the gods give you tears for me? Miss Dobson,\r\nwill your soul awaken? When I shall have sunk for ever beneath these\r\nwaters whose supposed purpose here this afternoon is but that they be\r\nploughed by the blades of these young oarsmen, will there be struck from\r\nthat flint, your heart, some late and momentary spark of pity for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy of course, of COURSE!\xe2\x80\x9d babbled Zuleika, with clasped hands and\r\ndazzling eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d she curbed herself, \xe2\x80\x9cit is--it would--oh, you\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t THINK of it! I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow it! I--I should never forgive\r\nmyself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn fact, you would mourn me always?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy yes!.. Y-es-always.\xe2\x80\x9d What else could she say? But would his answer\r\nbe that he dared not condemn her to lifelong torment?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d his answer was, \xe2\x80\x9cmy joy in dying for you is made perfect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer muscles relaxed. Her breath escaped between her teeth. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\nutterly resolved?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUtterly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing I might say could change your purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo entreaty, howsoever piteous, could move you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nForthwith she urged, entreated, cajoled, commanded, with infinite\r\nprettiness of ingenuity and of eloquence. Never was such a cascade of\r\ndissuasion as hers. She only didn\xe2\x80\x99t say she could love him. She never\r\nhinted that. Indeed, throughout her pleading rang this recurrent motif:\r\nthat he must live to take to himself as mate some good, serious, clever\r\nwoman who would be a not unworthy mother of his children.\r\n\r\nShe laid stress on his youth, his great position, his brilliant\r\nattainments, the much he had already achieved, the splendid\r\npossibilities of his future. Though of course she spoke in undertones,\r\nnot to be overheard by the throng on the barge, it was almost as though\r\nhis health were being floridly proposed at some public banquet--say,\r\nat a Tenants\xe2\x80\x99 Dinner. Insomuch that, when she ceased, the Duke half\r\nexpected Jellings, his steward, to bob up uttering, with lifted hands, a\r\nstentorian \xe2\x80\x9cFor-or,\xe2\x80\x9d and all the company to take up the chant: \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s--a\r\njolly good fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d His brief reply, on those occasions, seemed always\r\nto indicate that, whatever else he might be, a jolly good fellow he was\r\nnot. But by Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s eulogy he really was touched. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you--thank\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped; and there were tears in his eyes. Dear the thought that\r\nshe so revered him, so wished him not to die. But this was no more than\r\na rush-light in the austere radiance of his joy in dying for her.\r\n\r\nAnd the time was come. Now for the sacrament of his immersion in\r\ninfinity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d he said simply, and was about to swing himself on to the\r\nledge of the balustrade. Zuleika, divining his intention, made way for\r\nhim. Her bosom heaved quickly, quickly. All colour had left her face;\r\nbut her eyes shone as never before.\r\n\r\nAlready his foot was on the ledge, when hark! the sound of a distant\r\ngun. To Zuleika, with all the chords of her soul strung to the utmost\r\ntensity, the effect was as if she herself had been shot; and she\r\nclutched at the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s arm, like a frightened child. He laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\r\nthe signal for the race,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and laughed again, rather bitterly,\r\nat the crude and trivial interruption of high matters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe race?\xe2\x80\x9d She laughed hysterically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. \xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99re off\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d He mingled his laughter with hers, gently seeking\r\nto disengage his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI, clinging to the weeds\r\nof the river\xe2\x80\x99s bed, shall see dimly the boats and the oars pass over me,\r\nand shall be able to gurgle a cheer for Judas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d she shuddered, with a woman\xe2\x80\x99s notion that a jest means levity.\r\nA tumult of thoughts surged in her, all confused. She only knew that\r\nhe must not die--not yet! A moment ago, his death would have been\r\nbeautiful. Not now! Her grip of his arm tightened. Only by breaking her\r\nwrist could he have freed himself. A moment ago, she had been in the\r\nseventh-heaven... Men were supposed to have died for love of her. It\r\nhad never been proved. There had always been something--card-debts,\r\nill-health, what not--to account for the tragedy. No man, to the best\r\nof her recollection, had ever hinted that he was going to die for her.\r\nNever, assuredly, had she seen the deed done. And then came he, the\r\nfirst man she had loved, going to die here, before her eyes, because she\r\nno longer loved him. But she knew now that he must not die--not yet!\r\n\r\nAll around her was the hush that falls on Oxford when the signal for the\r\nrace has sounded. In the distance could be heard faintly the noise of\r\ncheering--a little sing-song sound, drawing nearer.\r\n\r\nAh, how could she have thought of letting him die so soon? She gazed\r\ninto his face--the face she might never have seen again. Even now, but\r\nfor that gun-shot, the waters would have closed over him, and his soul,\r\nmaybe, have passed away. She had saved him, thank heaven! She had him\r\nstill with her.\r\n\r\nGently, vainly, he still sought to unclasp her fingers from his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot now!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cNot yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the noise of the cheering, and of the trumpeting and rattling, as\r\nit drew near, was an accompaniment to her joy in having saved her lover.\r\nShe would keep him with her--for a while! Let all be done in order. She\r\nwould savour the full sweetness of his sacrifice. Tomorrow--to-morrow,\r\nyes, let him have his heart\xe2\x80\x99s desire of death. Not now! Not yet!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cto-morrow, if you will. Not yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe first boat came jerking past in mid-stream; and the towing-path,\r\nwith its serried throng of runners, was like a live thing, keeping pace.\r\nAs in a dream, Zuleika saw it. And the din was in her ears. No heroine\r\nof Wagner had ever a louder accompaniment than had ours to the surging\r\nsoul within her bosom.\r\n\r\nAnd the Duke, tightly held by her, vibrated as to a powerful electric\r\ncurrent. He let her cling to him, and her magnetism range through him.\r\nAh, it was good not to have died! Fool, he had meant to drain off-hand,\r\nat one coarse draught, the delicate wine of death. He would let his lips\r\ncaress the brim of the august goblet. He would dally with the aroma that\r\nwas there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo be it!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried into Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s ear--cried loudly, for it seemed as\r\nthough all the Wagnerian orchestras of Europe, with the Straussian ones\r\nthrown in, were here to clash in unison the full volume of right music\r\nfor the glory of the reprieve.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that the Judas boat had just bumped Univ., exactly opposite\r\nthe Judas barge. The oarsmen in either boat sat humped, panting, some of\r\nthem rocking and writhing, after their wholesome exercise. But there\r\nwas not one of them whose eyes were not upcast at Zuleika. And the\r\nvocalisation and instrumentation of the dancers and stampers on the\r\ntowing-path had by this time ceased to mean aught of joy in the victors\r\nor of comfort for the vanquished, and had resolved itself into a wild\r\nwordless hymn to the glory of Miss Dobson. Behind her and all around her\r\non the roof of the barge, young Judasians were venting in like manner\r\ntheir hearts through their lungs. She paid no heed. It was as if she\r\nstood alone with her lover on some silent pinnacle of the world. It was\r\nas if she were a little girl with a brand-new and very expensive doll\r\nwhich had banished all the little other old toys from her mind.\r\n\r\nShe simply could not, in her naive rapture, take her eyes off her\r\ncompanion. To the dancers and stampers of the towing-path, many of whom\r\nwere now being ferried back across the river, and to the other youths\r\non the roof of the barge, Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s air of absorption must have seemed\r\na little strange. For already the news that the Duke loved Zuleika, and\r\nthat she loved him not, and would stoop to no man who loved her, had\r\nspread like wild-fire among the undergraduates. The two youths in whom\r\nthe Duke had deigned to confide had not held their peace. And the effect\r\nthat Zuleika had made as she came down to the river was intensified by\r\nthe knowledge that not the great paragon himself did she deem worthy of\r\nher. The mere sight of her had captured young Oxford. The news of her\r\nsupernal haughtiness had riveted the chains.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke at length, staring around him with the eyes of one\r\nawakened from a dream. \xe2\x80\x9cCome! I must take you back to Judas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you won\xe2\x80\x99t leave me there?\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Zuleika. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will stay to\r\ndinner? I am sure my grandfather would be delighted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure he would,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, as he piloted her down the steps of\r\nthe barge. \xe2\x80\x9cBut alas, I have to dine at the Junta to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Junta? What is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little dining-club. It meets every Tuesday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut--you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean you are going to refuse me for that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo do so is misery. But I have no choice. I have asked a guest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen ask another: ask me!\xe2\x80\x9d Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s notions of Oxford life were rather\r\nhazy. It was with difficulty that the Duke made her realise that he\r\ncould not--not even if, as she suggested, she dressed herself up as a\r\nman--invite her to the Junta. She then fell back on the impossibility\r\nthat he would not dine with her to-night, his last night in this world.\r\nShe could not understand that admirable fidelity to social engagements\r\nwhich is one of the virtues implanted in the members of our aristocracy.\r\nBohemian by training and by career, she construed the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s refusal as\r\neither a cruel slight to herself or an act of imbecility. The thought of\r\nbeing parted from her for one moment was torture to him; but \xe2\x80\x9cnoblesse\r\noblige,\xe2\x80\x9d and it was quite impossible for him to break an engagement\r\nmerely because a more charming one offered itself: he would as soon have\r\ncheated at cards.\r\n\r\nAnd so, as they went side by side up the avenue, in the mellow light\r\nof the westering sun, preceded in their course, and pursued, and\r\nsurrounded, by the mob of hoarse infatuate youths, Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s face was\r\nas that of a little girl sulking. Vainly the Duke reasoned with her. She\r\ncould NOT see the point of view.\r\n\r\nWith that sudden softening that comes to the face of an angry woman who\r\nhas hit on a good argument, she turned to him and asked \xe2\x80\x9cHow if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsaved your life just now? Much you thought about your guest when you\r\nwere going to dive and die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not forget him,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Duke, smiling at her casuistry.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor had I any scruple in disappointing him. Death cancels all\r\nengagements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Zuleika, worsted, resumed her sulking. But presently, as they neared\r\nJudas, she relented. It was paltry to be cross with him who had resolved\r\nto die for her and was going to die so on the morrow. And after all, she\r\nwould see him at the concert to-night. They would sit together. And all\r\nto-morrow they would be together, till the time came for parting. Hers\r\nwas a naturally sunny disposition. And the evening was such a lovely\r\none, all bathed in gold. She was ashamed of her ill-humour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, touching his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cForgive me for being horrid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n And forgiven she promptly was. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd promise you will spend all to-morrow\r\nwith me.\xe2\x80\x9d And of course he promised.\r\n\r\nAs they stood together on the steps of the Warden\xe2\x80\x99s front-door, exalted\r\nabove the level of the flushed and swaying crowd that filled the whole\r\nlength and breadth of Judas Street, she implored him not to be late for\r\nthe concert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am never late,\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you\xe2\x80\x99re so beautifully brought up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door was opened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd--oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re beautiful besides!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered; and waved her hand\r\nto him as she vanished into the hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nA few minutes before half-past seven, the Duke, arrayed for dinner,\r\npassed leisurely up the High. The arresting feature of his costume was\r\na mulberry-coloured coat, with brass buttons. This, to any one versed in\r\nOxford lore, betokened him a member of the Junta. It is awful to think\r\nthat a casual stranger might have mistaken him for a footman. It does\r\nnot do to think of such things.\r\n\r\nThe tradesmen, at the doors of their shops, bowed low as he passed,\r\nrubbing their hands and smiling, hoping inwardly that they took no\r\nliberty in sharing the cool rosy air of the evening with his Grace. They\r\nnoted that he wore in his shirt-front a black pearl and a pink. \xe2\x80\x9cDaring,\r\nbut becoming,\xe2\x80\x9d they opined.\r\n\r\nThe rooms of the Junta were over a stationer\xe2\x80\x99s shop, next door but one\r\nto the Mitre. They were small rooms; but as the Junta had now, besides\r\nthe Duke, only two members, and as no member might introduce more than\r\none guest, there was ample space.\r\n\r\nThe Duke had been elected in his second term. At that time there were\r\nfour members; but these were all leaving Oxford at the end of the summer\r\nterm, and there seemed to be in the ranks of the Bullingdon and the\r\nLoder no one quite eligible for the Junta, that holy of holies. Thus it\r\nwas that the Duke inaugurated in solitude his second year of membership.\r\nFrom time to time, he proposed and seconded a few candidates, after\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csounding\xe2\x80\x9d them as to whether they were willing to join. But always,\r\nwhen election evening--the last Tuesday of term--drew near, he began to\r\nhave his doubts about these fellows. This one was \xe2\x80\x9crowdy\xe2\x80\x9d; that one\r\nwas over-dressed; another did not ride quite straight to hounds; in the\r\npedigree of another a bar-sinister was more than suspected. Election\r\nevening was always a rather melancholy time. After dinner, when the two\r\nclub servants had placed on the mahogany the time-worn Candidates\xe2\x80\x99 Book\r\nand the ballot-box, and had noiselessly withdrawn, the Duke, clearing\r\nhis throat, read aloud to himself \xe2\x80\x9cMr. So-and-So, of Such-and-Such\r\nCollege, proposed by the Duke of Dorset, seconded by the Duke of\r\nDorset,\xe2\x80\x9d and, in every case, when he drew out the drawer of the\r\nballot-box, found it was a black-ball that he had dropped into the urn.\r\nThus it was that at the end of the summer term the annual photographic\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgroup\xe2\x80\x9d taken by Messrs. Hills and Saunders was a presentment of the\r\nDuke alone.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his third year he had become less exclusive. Not\r\nbecause there seemed to be any one really worthy of the Junta; but\r\nbecause the Junta, having thriven since the eighteenth century, must\r\nnot die. Suppose--one never knew--he were struck by lightning, the Junta\r\nwould be no more. So, not without reluctance, but unanimously, he had\r\nelected The MacQuern, of Balliol, and Sir John Marraby, of Brasenose.\r\n\r\nTo-night, as he, a doomed man, went up into the familiar rooms, he was\r\nwholly glad that he had thus relented. As yet, he was spared the tragic\r\nknowledge that it would make no difference.*\r\n\r\n   * The Junta has been reconstituted. But the apostolic line was\r\n     broken, the thread was snapped; the old magic is fled.\r\n\r\nThe MacQuern and two other young men were already there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. President,\xe2\x80\x9d said The MacQuern, \xe2\x80\x9cI present Mr. Trent-Garby, of\r\nChrist Church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Junta is honoured,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, bowing.\r\n\r\nSuch was the ritual of the club.\r\n\r\nThe other young man, because his host, Sir John Marraby, was not yet on\r\nthe scene, had no locus standi, and, though a friend of The MacQuern,\r\nand well known to the Duke, had to be ignored.\r\n\r\nA moment later, Sir John arrived. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. President,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI present\r\nLord Sayes, of Magdalen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Junta is honoured,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, bowing.\r\n\r\nBoth hosts and both guests, having been prominent in the throng that\r\nvociferated around Zuleika an hour earlier, were slightly abashed in\r\nthe Duke\xe2\x80\x99s presence. He, however, had not noticed any one in particular,\r\nand, even if he had, that fine tradition of the club--\xe2\x80\x9cA member of the\r\nJunta can do no wrong; a guest of the Junta cannot err\xe2\x80\x9d--would have\r\nprevented him from showing his displeasure.\r\n\r\nA Herculean figure filled the doorway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Junta is honoured,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, bowing to his guest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuke,\xe2\x80\x9d said the newcomer quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cthe honour is as much mine as\r\nthat of the interesting and ancient institution which I am this night\r\nprivileged to inspect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTurning to Sir John and The MacQuern, the Duke said \xe2\x80\x9cI present Mr.\r\nAbimelech V. Oover, of Trinity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Junta,\xe2\x80\x9d they replied, \xe2\x80\x9cis honoured.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rhodes Scholar, \xe2\x80\x9cyour good courtesy is just such\r\nas I would have anticipated from members of the ancient Junta. Like most\r\nof my countrymen, I am a man of few words. We are habituated out there\r\nto act rather than talk. Judged from the view-point of your beautiful\r\nold civilisation, I am aware my curtness must seem crude. But,\r\ngentlemen, believe me, right here--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDinner is served, your Grace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus interrupted, Mr. Oover, with the resourcefulness of a practised\r\norator, brought his thanks to a quick but not abrupt conclusion. The\r\nlittle company passed into the front room.\r\n\r\nThrough the window, from the High, fading daylight mingled with the\r\ncandle-light. The mulberry coats of the hosts, interspersed by the black\r\nones of the guests, made a fine pattern around the oval table a-gleam\r\nwith the many curious pieces of gold and silver plate that had accrued\r\nto the Junta in course of years.\r\n\r\nThe President showed much deference to his guest. He seemed to listen\r\nwith close attention to the humorous anecdote with which, in the\r\nAmerican fashion, Mr. Oover inaugurated dinner.\r\n\r\nTo all Rhodes Scholars, indeed, his courtesy was invariable. He went out\r\nof his way to cultivate them. And this he did more as a favour to Lord\r\nMilner than of his own caprice. He found these Scholars, good fellows\r\nthough they were, rather oppressive. They had not--how could they\r\nhave?--the undergraduate\xe2\x80\x99s virtue of taking Oxford as a matter of\r\ncourse. The Germans loved it too little, the Colonials too much. The\r\nAmericans were, to a sensitive observer, the most troublesome--as being\r\nthe most troubled--of the whole lot. The Duke was not one of those\r\nEnglishmen who fling, or care to hear flung, cheap sneers at America.\r\nWhenever any one in his presence said that America was not large\r\nin area, he would firmly maintain that it was. He held, too, in his\r\nenlightened way, that Americans have a perfect right to exist. But\r\nhe did often find himself wishing Mr. Rhodes had not enabled them to\r\nexercise that right in Oxford. They were so awfully afraid of having\r\ntheir strenuous native characters undermined by their delight in the\r\nplace. They held that the future was theirs, a glorious asset, far more\r\nglorious than the past. But a theory, as the Duke saw, is one thing, an\r\nemotion another. It is so much easier to covet what one hasn\xe2\x80\x99t than to\r\nrevel in what one has. Also, it is so much easier to be enthusiastic\r\nabout what exists than about what doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. The future doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist. The\r\npast does. For, whereas all men can learn, the gift of prophecy has died\r\nout. A man cannot work up in his breast any real excitement about what\r\npossibly won\xe2\x80\x99t happen. He cannot very well help being sentimentally\r\ninterested in what he knows has happened. On the other hand, he owes a\r\nduty to his country. And, if his country be America, he ought to try to\r\nfeel a vivid respect for the future, and a cold contempt for the past.\r\nAlso, if he be selected by his country as a specimen of the best moral,\r\nphysical, and intellectual type that she can produce for the astounding\r\nof the effete foreigner, and incidentally for the purpose of raising\r\nthat foreigner\xe2\x80\x99s tone, he must--mustn\xe2\x80\x99t he?--do his best to astound,\r\nto exalt. But then comes in this difficulty. Young men don\xe2\x80\x99t like to\r\nastound and exalt their fellows. And Americans, individually, are of\r\nall people the most anxious to please. That they talk overmuch is often\r\ntaken as a sign of self-satisfaction. It is merely a mannerism. Rhetoric\r\nis a thing inbred in them. They are quite unconscious of it. It is as\r\nnatural to them as breathing. And, while they talk on, they really do\r\nbelieve that they are a quick, businesslike people, by whom things are\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cput through\xe2\x80\x9d with an almost brutal abruptness. This notion of theirs is\r\nrather confusing to the patient English auditor.\r\n\r\nAltogether, the American Rhodes Scholars, with their splendid native\r\ngift of oratory, and their modest desire to please, and their not less\r\nevident feeling that they ought merely to edify, and their constant\r\ndelight in all that of Oxford their English brethren don\xe2\x80\x99t notice, and\r\ntheir constant fear that they are being corrupted, are a noble, rather\r\nthan a comfortable, element in the social life of the University. So, at\r\nleast, they seemed to the Duke.\r\n\r\nAnd to-night, but that he had invited Oover to dine with him, he could\r\nhave been dining with Zuleika. And this was his last dinner on earth.\r\nSuch thoughts made him the less able to take pleasure in his guest.\r\nPerfect, however, the amenity of his manner.\r\n\r\nThis was the more commendable because Oover\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9caura\xe2\x80\x9d was even more\r\ndisturbing than that of the average Rhodes Scholar. To-night, besides\r\nthe usual conflicts in this young man\xe2\x80\x99s bosom, raged a special one\r\nbetween his desire to behave well and his jealousy of the man who had\r\nto-day been Miss Dobson\xe2\x80\x99s escort. In theory he denied the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s right\r\nto that honour. In sentiment he admitted it. Another conflict, you see.\r\nAnd another. He longed to orate about the woman who had his heart; yet\r\nshe was the one topic that must be shirked.\r\n\r\nThe MacQuern and Mr. Trent-Garby, Sir John Marraby and Lord Sayes, they\r\ntoo--though they were no orators--would fain have unpacked their hearts\r\nin words about Zuleika. They spoke of this and that, automatically, none\r\nlistening to another--each man listening, wide-eyed, to his own heart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsolo on the Zuleika theme, and drinking rather more champagne than was\r\ngood for him. Maybe, these youths sowed in themselves, on this night,\r\nthe seeds of lifelong intemperance. We cannot tell. They did not live\r\nlong enough for us to know.\r\n\r\nWhile the six dined, a seventh, invisible to them, leaned moodily\r\nagainst the mantel-piece, watching them. He was not of their time. His\r\nlong brown hair was knotted in a black riband behind. He wore a pale\r\nbrocaded coat and lace ruffles, silken stockings, a sword. Privy to\r\ntheir doom, he watched them. He was loth that his Junta must die. Yes,\r\nhis. Could the diners have seen him, they would have known him by his\r\nresemblance to the mezzotint portrait that hung on the wall above him.\r\nThey would have risen to their feet in presence of Humphrey Greddon,\r\nfounder and first president of the club.\r\n\r\nHis face was not so oval, nor were his eyes so big, nor his lips so\r\nfull, nor his hands so delicate, as they appeared in the mezzotint. Yet\r\n(bating the conventions of eighteenth-century portraiture) the likeness\r\nwas a good one. Humphrey Greddon was not less well-knit and graceful\r\nthan the painter had made him, and, hard though the lines of the face\r\nwere, there was about him a certain air of high romance that could not\r\nbe explained away by the fact that he was of a period not our own. You\r\ncould understand the great love that Nellie O\xe2\x80\x99Mora had borne him.\r\n\r\nUnder the mezzotint hung Hoppner\xe2\x80\x99s miniature of that lovely and\r\nill-starred girl, with her soft dark eyes, and her curls all astray from\r\nbeneath her little blue turban. And the Duke was telling Mr. Oover her\r\nstory--how she had left her home for Humphrey Greddon when she was but\r\nsixteen, and he an undergraduate at Christ Church; and had lived for him\r\nin a cottage at Littlemore, whither he would ride, most days, to be with\r\nher; and how he tired of her, broke his oath that he would marry her,\r\nthereby broke her heart; and how she drowned herself in a mill-pond; and\r\nhow Greddon was killed in Venice, two years later, duelling on the Riva\r\nSchiavoni with a Senator whose daughter he had seduced.\r\n\r\nAnd he, Greddon, was not listening very attentively to the tale. He\r\nhad heard it told so often in this room, and he did not understand\r\nthe sentiments of the modern world. Nellie had been a monstrous pretty\r\ncreature. He had adored her, and had done with her. It was right that\r\nshe should always be toasted after dinner by the Junta, as in the days\r\nwhen first he loved her--\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s to Nellie O\xe2\x80\x99Mora, the fairest witch\r\nthat ever was or will be!\xe2\x80\x9d He would have resented the omission of that\r\ntoast. But he was sick of the pitying, melting looks that were always\r\ncast towards her miniature. Nellie had been beautiful, but, by God! she\r\nwas always a dunce and a simpleton. How could he have spent his life\r\nwith her? She was a fool, by God! not to marry that fool Trailby, of\r\nMerton, whom he took to see her.\r\n\r\nMr. Oover\xe2\x80\x99s moral tone, and his sense of chivalry, were of the American\r\nkind: far higher than ours, even, and far better expressed. Whereas the\r\nEnglish guests of the Junta, when they heard the tale of Nellie O\xe2\x80\x99Mora,\r\nwould merely murmur \xe2\x80\x9cPoor girl!\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a shame!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Oover said in a\r\ntone of quiet authority that compelled Greddon\xe2\x80\x99s ear \xe2\x80\x9cDuke, I hope I am\r\nnot incognisant of the laws that govern the relations of guest and host.\r\nBut, Duke, I aver deliberately that the founder of this fine old\r\nclub; at which you are so splendidly entertaining me to-night, was an\r\nunmitigated scoundrel. I say he was not a white man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the word \xe2\x80\x9cscoundrel,\xe2\x80\x9d Humphrey Greddon had sprung forward, drawing\r\nhis sword, and loudly, in a voice audible to himself alone, challenged\r\nthe American to make good his words. Then, as this gentleman took no\r\nnotice, with one clean straight thrust Greddon ran him through the\r\nheart, shouting \xe2\x80\x9cDie, you damned psalm-singer and traducer! And so die\r\nall rebels against King George!\xe2\x80\x9d* Withdrawing the blade, he wiped it\r\ndaintily on his cambric handkerchief. There was no blood. Mr. Oover,\r\nwith unpunctured shirt-front, was repeating \xe2\x80\x9cI say he was not a white\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d And Greddon remembered himself--remembered he was only a ghost,\r\nimpalpable, impotent, of no account. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I shall meet you in Hell\r\nto-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he hissed in Oover\xe2\x80\x99s face. And there he was wrong. It is\r\nquite certain that Oover went to Heaven.\r\n\r\n   * As Edward VII. was at this time on the throne, it must have been\r\n     to George III. that Mr. Greddon was referring.\r\n\r\nUnable to avenge himself, Greddon had looked to the Duke to act for him.\r\nWhen he saw that this young man did but smile at Oover and make a vague\r\ndeprecatory gesture, he again, in his wrath, forgot his disabilities.\r\nDrawing himself to his full height, he took with great deliberation a\r\npinch of snuff, and, bowing low to the Duke, said \xe2\x80\x9cI am vastly obleeged\r\nto your Grace for the fine high Courage you have exhibited in the behalf\r\nof your most Admiring, most Humble Servant.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, having brushed away\r\na speck of snuff from his jabot, he turned on his heel; and only in the\r\ndoorway, where one of the club servants, carrying a decanter in each\r\nhand, walked straight through him, did he realise that he had not\r\nspoilt the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s evening. With a volley of the most appalling\r\neighteenth-century oaths, he passed back into the nether world.\r\n\r\nTo the Duke, Nellie O\xe2\x80\x99Mora had never been a very vital figure. He had\r\noften repeated the legend of her. But, having never known what love was,\r\nhe could not imagine her rapture or her anguish. Himself the quarry of\r\nall Mayfair\xe2\x80\x99s wise virgins, he had always--so far as he thought of\r\nthe matter at all--suspected that Nellie\xe2\x80\x99s death was due to thwarted\r\nambition. But to-night, while he told Oover about her, he could see\r\ninto her soul. Nor did he pity her. She had loved. She had known the\r\none thing worth living for--and dying for. She, as she went down to the\r\nmill-pond, had felt just that ecstasy of self-sacrifice which he himself\r\nhad felt to-day and would feel to-morrow. And for a while, too--for a\r\nfull year--she had known the joy of being loved, had been for Greddon\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe fairest witch that ever was or will be.\xe2\x80\x9d He could not agree with\r\nOover\xe2\x80\x99s long disquisition on her sufferings. And, glancing at her\r\nwell-remembered miniature, he wondered just what it was in her that had\r\ncaptivated Greddon. He was in that blest state when a man cannot believe\r\nthe earth has been trodden by any really beautiful or desirable lady\r\nsave the lady of his own heart.\r\n\r\nThe moment had come for the removal of the table-cloth. The mahogany of\r\nthe Junta was laid bare--a clear dark lake, anon to reflect in its still\r\nand ruddy depths the candelabras and the fruit-cradles, the slender\r\nglasses and the stout old decanters, the forfeit-box and the snuff-box,\r\nand other paraphernalia of the dignity of dessert. Lucidly, and\r\nunwaveringly inverted in the depths these good things stood; and, so\r\nsoon as the wine had made its circuit, the Duke rose and with uplifted\r\nglass proposed the first of the two toasts traditional to the Junta.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, I give you Church and State.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe toast having been honoured by all--and by none with a richer\r\nreverence than by Oover, despite his passionate mental reservation in\r\nfavour of Pittsburg-Anabaptism and the Republican Ideal--the snuff-box\r\nwas handed round, and fruit was eaten.\r\n\r\nPresently, when the wine had gone round again, the Duke rose and with\r\nuplifted glass said \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, I give you--\xe2\x80\x9d and there halted.\r\nSilent, frowning, flushed, he stood for a few moments, and then, with\r\na deliberate gesture, tilted his glass and let fall the wine to the\r\ncarpet. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking round the table, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot give you\r\nNellie O\xe2\x80\x99Mora.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Sir John Marraby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a right to ask that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, still standing. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\r\nonly say that my conscience is stronger than my sense of what is due to\r\nthe customs of the club. Nellie O\xe2\x80\x99Mora,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, passing his hand over\r\nhis brow, \xe2\x80\x9cmay have been in her day the fairest witch that ever was--so\r\nfair that our founder had good reason to suppose her the fairest witch\r\nthat ever would be. But his prediction was a false one. So at least it\r\nseems to me. Of course I cannot both hold this view and remain President\r\nof this club. MacQuern--Marraby--which of you is Vice-President?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marraby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, MacQuern, you are hereby President, vice myself resigned. Take\r\nthe chair and propose the toast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather not,\xe2\x80\x9d said The MacQuern after a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Marraby, YOU must.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marraby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is this?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Duke, looking from one to the other.\r\n\r\nThe MacQuern, with Scotch caution, was silent. But the impulsive\r\nMarraby--Madcap Marraby, as they called him in B.N.C.--said \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbecause I won\xe2\x80\x99t lie!\xe2\x80\x9d and, leaping up, raised his glass aloft and cried\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give you Zuleika Dobson, the fairest witch that ever was or will be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Oover, Lord Sayes, Mr. Trent-Garby, sprang to their feet; The\r\nMacQuern rose to his. \xe2\x80\x9cZuleika Dobson!\xe2\x80\x9d they cried, and drained their\r\nglasses.\r\n\r\nThen, when they had resumed their seats, came an awkward pause. The\r\nDuke, still erect beside the chair he had vacated, looked very grave\r\nand pale. Marraby had taken an outrageous liberty. But \xe2\x80\x9ca member of the\r\nJunta can do no wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d and the liberty could not be resented. The Duke\r\nfelt that the blame was on himself, who had elected Marraby to the club.\r\n\r\nMr. Oover, too, looked grave. All the antiquarian in him deplored\r\nthe sudden rupture of a fine old Oxford tradition. All the chivalrous\r\nAmerican in him resented the slight on that fair victim of the feudal\r\nsystem, Miss O\xe2\x80\x99Mora. And, at the same time, all the Abimelech V. in him\r\nrejoiced at having honoured by word and act the one woman in the world.\r\n\r\nGazing around at the flushed faces and heaving shirt-fronts of the\r\ndiners, the Duke forgot Marraby\xe2\x80\x99s misdemeanour. What mattered far more\r\nto him was that here were five young men deeply under the spell of\r\nZuleika. They must be saved, if possible. He knew how strong his\r\ninfluence was in the University. He knew also how strong was Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nHe had not much hope of the issue. But his new-born sense of duty to his\r\nfellows spurred him on. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked with a bitter smile, \xe2\x80\x9cany\r\none of you who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t with his whole heart love Miss Dobson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNobody held up a hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I feared,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, knowing not that if a hand had been held\r\nup he would have taken it as a personal insult. No man really in love\r\ncan forgive another for not sharing his ardour. His jealousy for himself\r\nwhen his beloved prefers another man is hardly a stronger passion than\r\nhis jealousy for her when she is not preferred to all other women.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know her only by sight--by repute?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Duke. They signified\r\nthat this was so. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would introduce me to her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marraby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are all coming to the Judas concert tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d the Duke asked,\r\nignoring Marraby. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have all secured tickets?\xe2\x80\x9d They nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cTo hear\r\nme play, or to see Miss Dobson?\xe2\x80\x9d There was a murmur of \xe2\x80\x9cBoth--both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you would all of you, like Marraby, wish to be presented to this\r\nlady?\xe2\x80\x9d Their eyes dilated. \xe2\x80\x9cThat way happiness lies, think you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, happiness be hanged!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marraby.\r\n\r\nTo the Duke this seemed a profoundly sane remark--an epitome of his own\r\nsentiments. But what was right for himself was not right for all. He\r\nbelieved in convention as the best way for average mankind. And so,\r\nslowly, calmly, he told to his fellow-diners just what he had told a few\r\nhours earlier to those two young men in Salt Cellar. Not knowing that\r\nhis words had already been spread throughout Oxford, he was rather\r\nsurprised that they seemed to make no sensation. Quite flat, too, fell\r\nhis appeal that the syren be shunned by all.\r\n\r\nMr. Oover, during his year of residence, had been sorely tried by the\r\nquaint old English custom of not making public speeches after private\r\ndinners. It was with a deep sigh of satisfaction that he now rose to his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuke,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a low voice, which yet penetrated to every corner\r\nof the room, \xe2\x80\x9cI guess I am voicing these gentlemen when I say that your\r\nwords show up your good heart, all the time. Your mentality, too, is\r\nbully, as we all predicate. One may say without exaggeration that your\r\nscholarly and social attainments are a by-word throughout the solar\r\nsystem, and be-yond. We rightly venerate you as our boss. Sir, we\r\nworship the ground you walk on. But we owe a duty to our own free and\r\nindependent manhood. Sir, we worship the ground Miss Z. Dobson treads\r\non. We have pegged out a claim right there. And from that location\r\nwe aren\xe2\x80\x99t to be budged--not for bob-nuts. We asseverate we\r\nsquat--where--we--squat, come--what--will. You say we have no chance to\r\nwin Miss Z. Dobson. That--we--know. We aren\xe2\x80\x99t worthy. We lie prone. Let\r\nher walk over us. You say her heart is cold. We don\xe2\x80\x99t pro-fess we\r\ncan take the chill off. But, Sir, we can\xe2\x80\x99t be diverted out of loving\r\nher--not even by you, Sir. No, Sir! We love her, and--shall, and--will,\r\nSir, with--our--latest breath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis peroration evoked loud applause. \xe2\x80\x9cI love her, and shall, and will,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n shouted each man. And again they honoured in wine her image. Sir John\r\nMarraby uttered a cry familiar in the hunting-field. The MacQuern\r\ncontributed a few bars of a sentimental ballad in the dialect of his\r\ncountry. \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah, hurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Mr. Trent-Garby. Lord Sayes hummed\r\nthe latest waltz, waving his arms to its rhythm, while the wine he had\r\njust spilt on his shirt-front trickled unheeded to his waistcoat. Mr.\r\nOover gave the Yale cheer.\r\n\r\nThe genial din was wafted down through the open window to the\r\npassers-by. The wine-merchant across the way heard it, and smiled\r\npensively. \xe2\x80\x9cYouth, youth!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\nThe genial din grew louder.\r\n\r\nAt any other time, the Duke would have been jarred by the disgrace to\r\nthe Junta. But now, as he stood with bent head, covering his face with\r\nhis hands, he thought only of the need to rid these young men, here\r\nand now, of the influence that had befallen them. To-morrow his tragic\r\nexample might be too late, the mischief have sunk too deep, the agony be\r\nlife-long. His good breeding forbade him to cast over a dinner-table the\r\nshadow of his death. His conscience insisted that he must. He uncovered\r\nhis face, and held up one hand for silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are all of us,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cold enough to remember vividly the\r\ndemonstrations made in the streets of London when war was declared\r\nbetween us and the Transvaal Republic. You, Mr. Oover, doubtless heard\r\nin America the echoes of those ebullitions. The general idea was that\r\nthe war was going to be a very brief and simple affair--what was called\r\n\xe2\x80\x98a walk-over.\xe2\x80\x99 To me, though I was only a small boy, it seemed that all\r\nthis delirious pride in the prospect of crushing a trumpery foe argued\r\na defect in our sense of proportion. Still, I was able to understand the\r\ndemonstrators\xe2\x80\x99 point of view. To \xe2\x80\x98the giddy vulgar\xe2\x80\x99 any sort of victory\r\nis pleasant. But defeat? If, when that war was declared, every one had\r\nbeen sure that not only should we fail to conquer the Transvaal, but\r\nthat IT would conquer US--that not only would it make good its freedom\r\nand independence, but that we should forfeit ours--how would the\r\ncits have felt then? Would they not have pulled long faces, spoken in\r\nwhispers, wept? You must forgive me for saying that the noise you have\r\njust made around this table was very like to the noise made on the verge\r\nof the Boer War. And your procedure seems to me as unaccountable as\r\nwould have seemed the antics of those mobs if England had been plainly\r\ndoomed to disaster and to vassalage. My guest here to-night, in the\r\ncourse of his very eloquent and racy speech, spoke of the need that he\r\nand you should preserve your \xe2\x80\x98free and independent manhood.\xe2\x80\x99 That seemed\r\nto me an irreproachable ideal. But I confess I was somewhat taken aback\r\nby my friend\xe2\x80\x99s scheme for realising it. He declared his intention of\r\nlying prone and letting Miss Dobson \xe2\x80\x98walk over\xe2\x80\x99 him; and he advised you\r\nto follow his example; and to this counsel you gave evident approval.\r\nGentlemen, suppose that on the verge of the aforesaid war, some orator\r\nhad said to the British people \xe2\x80\x98It is going to be a walk-over for our\r\nenemy in the field. Mr. Kruger holds us in the hollow of his hand.\r\nIn subjection to him we shall find our long-lost freedom and\r\nindependence\xe2\x80\x99--what would have been Britannia\xe2\x80\x99s answer? What, on\r\nreflection, is yours to Mr. Oover? What are Mr. Oover\xe2\x80\x99s own second\r\nthoughts?\xe2\x80\x9d The Duke paused, with a smile to his guest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo right ahead, Duke,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Oover. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll re-ply when my turn\r\ncomes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not utterly demolish me, I hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke. His was the Oxford\r\nmanner. \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cis it possible that Britannia would\r\nhave thrown her helmet in the air, shrieking \xe2\x80\x98Slavery for ever\xe2\x80\x99? You,\r\ngentlemen, seem to think slavery a pleasant and an honourable state. You\r\nhave less experience of it than I. I have been enslaved to Miss Dobson\r\nsince yesterday evening; you, only since this afternoon; I, at close\r\nquarters; you, at a respectful distance. Your fetters have not galled\r\nyou yet. MY wrists, MY ankles, are excoriated. The iron has entered into\r\nmy soul. I droop. I stumble. Blood flows from me. I quiver and curse. I\r\nwrithe. The sun mocks me. The moon titters in my face. I can stand it no\r\nlonger. I will no more of it. Tomorrow I die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe flushed faces of the diners grew gradually pale. Their eyes lost\r\nlustre. Their tongues clove to the roofs of their mouths.\r\n\r\nAt length, almost inaudibly, The MacQuern asked \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean you are\r\ngoing to commit suicide?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cif you choose to put it in that way. Yes. And it\r\nis only by a chance that I did not commit suicide this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou--don\xe2\x80\x99t--say,\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Mr. Oover.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I ask you all to weigh well my\r\nmessage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut--but does Miss Dobson know?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sir John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply. \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, it was she who persuaded me not to die\r\ntill to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut--but,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Lord Sayes, \xe2\x80\x9cI saw her saying good-bye to you in\r\nJudas Street. And--and she looked quite--as if nothing had happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing HAD happened,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd she was very much pleased\r\nto have me still with her. But she isn\xe2\x80\x99t so cruel as to hinder me from\r\ndying for her to-morrow. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she exactly fixed the hour. It\r\nshall be just after the Eights have been rowed. An earlier death would\r\nmark in me a lack of courtesy to that contest... It seems strange to\r\nyou that I should do this thing? Take warning by me. Muster all your\r\nwill-power, and forget Miss Dobson. Tear up your tickets for the\r\nconcert. Stay here and play cards. Play high. Or rather, go back to your\r\nvarious Colleges, and speed the news I have told you. Put all Oxford on\r\nits guard against this woman who can love no lover. Let all Oxford\r\nknow that I, Dorset, who had so much reason to love life--I, the\r\nnonpareil--am going to die for the love I bear this woman. And let no\r\nman think I go unwilling. I am no lamb led to the slaughter. I am priest\r\nas well as victim. I offer myself up with a pious joy. But enough\r\nof this cold Hebraism! It is ill-attuned to my soul\xe2\x80\x99s mood.\r\nSelf-sacrifice--bah! Regard me as a voluptuary. I am that. All my\r\nbaffled ardour speeds me to the bosom of Death. She is gentle and\r\nwanton. She knows I could never have loved her for her own sake. She\r\nhas no illusions about me. She knows well I come to her because not\r\notherwise may I quench my passion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence. The Duke, looking around at the bent heads and\r\ndrawn mouths of his auditors, saw that his words had gone home. It was\r\nMarraby who revealed how powerfully home they had gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDorset,\xe2\x80\x9d he said huskily, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall die too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke flung up his hands, staring wildly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stand in with that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Oover.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord Sayes. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Trent-Garby; \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I!\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nMacQuern.\r\n\r\nThe Duke found voice. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you mad?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, clutching at his throat.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you all mad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Duke,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Oover. \xe2\x80\x9cOr, if we are, you have no right to be at\r\nlarge. You have shown us the way. We--take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so,\xe2\x80\x9d said The MacQuern, stolidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, you fools,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Duke. But through the open window came\r\nthe vibrant stroke of some clock. He wheeled round, plucked out his\r\nwatch--nine!--the concert!--his promise not to be late!--Zuleika!\r\n\r\nAll other thoughts vanished. In an instant he dodged beneath the sash\r\nof the window. From the flower-box he sprang to the road beneath. (The\r\nfacade of the house is called, to this day, Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s Leap.) Alighting\r\nwith the legerity of a cat, he swerved leftward in the recoil, and was\r\noff, like a streak of mulberry-coloured lightning, down the High.\r\n\r\nThe other men had rushed to the window, fearing the worst. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nOover. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Saves time!\xe2\x80\x9d and he raised himself on to the\r\nwindow-box. It splintered under his weight. He leapt heavily but well,\r\nfollowed by some uprooted geraniums. Squaring his shoulders, he threw\r\nback his head, and doubled down the slope.\r\n\r\nThere was a violent jostle between the remaining men. The MacQuern\r\ncannily got out of it, and rushed downstairs. He emerged at the\r\nfront-door just after Marraby touched ground. The Baronet\xe2\x80\x99s left ankle\r\nhad twisted under him. His face was drawn with pain as he hopped down\r\nthe High on his right foot, fingering his ticket for the concert. Next\r\nleapt Lord Sayes. And last of all leapt Mr. Trent-Garby, who, catching\r\nhis foot in the ruined flower-box, fell headlong, and was, I regret to\r\nsay, killed. Lord Sayes passed Sir John in a few paces. The MacQuern\r\novertook Mr. Oover at St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s and outstripped him in Radcliffe\r\nSquare. The Duke came in an easy first.\r\n\r\nYouth, youth!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nAcross the Front Quadrangle, heedless of the great crowd to right and\r\nleft, Dorset rushed. Up the stone steps to the Hall he bounded, and\r\nonly on the Hall\xe2\x80\x99s threshold was he brought to a pause. The doorway\r\nwas blocked by the backs of youths who had by hook and crook secured\r\nstanding-room. The whole scene was surprisingly unlike that of the\r\naverage College concert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me pass,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, rather breathlessly. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you. Make way\r\nplease. Thanks.\xe2\x80\x9d And with quick-pulsing heart he made his way down the\r\naisle to the front row. There awaited him a surprise that was like a\r\ndouche of cold water full in his face. Zuleika was not there! It had\r\nnever occurred to him that she herself might not be punctual.\r\n\r\nThe Warden was there, reading his programme with an air of great\r\nsolemnity. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cis your grand-daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d His tone\r\nwas as of a man saying \xe2\x80\x9cIf she is dead, don\xe2\x80\x99t break it gently to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy grand-daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Warden. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Duke, good evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, I think not. She said something about changing the dress she\r\nwore at dinner. She will come.\xe2\x80\x9d And the Warden thanked his young friend\r\nfor the great kindness he had shown to Zuleika. He hoped the Duke had\r\nnot let her worry him with her artless prattle. \xe2\x80\x9cShe seems to be a good,\r\namiable girl,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in his detached way.\r\n\r\nSitting beside him, the Duke looked curiously at the venerable profile,\r\nas at a mummy\xe2\x80\x99s. To think that this had once been a man! To think that\r\nhis blood flowed in the veins of Zuleika! Hitherto the Duke had seen\r\nnothing grotesque in him--had regarded him always as a dignified\r\nspecimen of priest and scholar. Such a life as the Warden\xe2\x80\x99s, year\r\nfollowing year in ornamental seclusion from the follies and fusses of\r\nthe world, had to the Duke seemed rather admirable and enviable. Often\r\nhe himself had (for a minute or so) meditated taking a fellowship at All\r\nSouls and spending here in Oxford the greater part of his life. He had\r\nnever been young, and it never had occurred to him that the Warden had\r\nbeen young once. To-night he saw the old man in a new light--saw that\r\nhe was mad. Here was a man who--for had he not married and begotten a\r\nchild?--must have known, in some degree, the emotion of love. How, after\r\nthat, could he have gone on thus, year by year, rusting among his\r\nbooks, asking no favour of life, waiting for death without a sign of\r\nimpatience? Why had he not killed himself long ago? Why cumbered he the\r\nearth?\r\n\r\nOn the dais an undergraduate was singing a song entitled \xe2\x80\x9cShe Loves Not\r\nMe.\xe2\x80\x9d Such plaints are apt to leave us unharrowed. Across the footlights\r\nof an opera-house, the despair of some Italian tenor in red tights and\r\na yellow wig may be convincing enough. Not so, at a concert, the despair\r\nof a shy British amateur in evening dress. The undergraduate on the\r\ndais, fumbling with his sheet of music while he predicted that only when\r\nhe were \xe2\x80\x9claid within the church-yard cold and grey\xe2\x80\x9d would his lady\r\nbegin to pity him, seemed to the Duke rather ridiculous; but not half so\r\nridiculous as the Warden. This fictitious love-affair was less nugatory\r\nthan the actual humdrum for which Dr. Dobson had sold his soul to the\r\ndevil. Also, little as one might suspect it, the warbler was perhaps\r\nexpressing a genuine sentiment. Zuleika herself, belike, was in his\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nAs he began the second stanza, predicting that when his lady died too\r\nthe angels of heaven would bear her straight to him, the audience heard\r\na loud murmur, or subdued roar, outside the Hall. And after a few bars\r\nthe warbler suddenly ceased, staring straight in front of him as though\r\nhe saw a vision. Automatically, all heads veered in the direction of his\r\ngaze. From the entrance, slowly along the aisle, came Zuleika, brilliant\r\nin black.\r\n\r\nTo the Duke, who had rapturously risen, she nodded and smiled as\r\nshe swerved down on the chair beside him. She looked to him somehow\r\ndifferent. He had quite forgiven her for being late: her mere presence\r\nwas a perfect excuse. And the very change in her, though he could not\r\ndefine it, was somehow pleasing to him. He was about to question\r\nher, but she shook her head and held up to her lips a black-gloved\r\nforefinger, enjoining silence for the singer, who, with dogged British\r\npluck, had harked back to the beginning of the second stanza. When his\r\ntask was done and he shuffled down from the dais, he received a great\r\novation. Zuleika, in the way peculiar to persons who are in the habit of\r\nappearing before the public, held her hands well above the level of\r\nher brow, and clapped them with a vigour demonstrative not less of her\r\npresence than of her delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, turning to the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you see? do you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething, yes. But what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it plain?\xe2\x80\x9d Lightly she touched the lobe of her left ear. \xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou flattered?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe knew now what made the difference. It was that her little face was\r\nflanked by two black pearls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9chow deeply I must have been brooding over you since\r\nwe parted!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this really,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, pointing to the left ear-ring, \xe2\x80\x9cthe pearl\r\nyou wore to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it strange? A man ought to be pleased when a woman goes\r\nquite unconsciously into mourning for him--goes just because she really\r\ndoes mourn him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am more than pleased. I am touched. When did the change come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I only noticed it after dinner, when I saw myself in the\r\nmirror. All through dinner I had been thinking of you and of--well, of\r\nto-morrow. And this dear sensitive pink pearl had again expressed my\r\nsoul. And there was I, in a yellow gown with green embroideries, gay\r\nas a jacamar, jarring hideously on myself. I covered my eyes and rushed\r\nupstairs, rang the bell and tore my things off. My maid was very cross.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCross! The Duke was shot through with envy of one who was in a position\r\nto be unkind to Zuleika. \xe2\x80\x9cHappy maid!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. Zuleika replied that\r\nhe was stealing her thunder: hadn\xe2\x80\x99t she envied the girl at his lodgings?\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwanted only to serve you in meekness. The idea of\r\never being pert to you didn\xe2\x80\x99t enter into my head. You show a side of\r\nyour character as unpleasing as it was unforeseen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cit is as well that I am going to die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She acknowledged his rebuke with a pretty gesture of penitence. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmay have been faultless in love,\xe2\x80\x9d he added; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you would not have laid\r\ndown your life for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I though? You don\xe2\x80\x99t know me. That is just\r\nthe sort of thing I should have loved to do. I am much more romantic\r\nthan you are, really. I wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, glancing at his breast, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nYOUR pink pearl would have turned black? And I wonder if YOU would have\r\ntaken the trouble to change that extraordinary coat you are wearing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn sooth, no costume could have been more beautifully Cimmerian than\r\nZuleika\xe2\x80\x99s. And yet, thought the Duke, watching her as the concert\r\nproceeded, the effect of her was not lugubrious. Her darkness shone.\r\nThe black satin gown she wore was a stream of shifting high-lights.\r\nBig black diamonds were around her throat and wrists, and tiny black\r\ndiamonds starred the fan she wielded. In her hair gleamed a great\r\nraven\xe2\x80\x99s wing. And brighter, brighter than all these were her eyes.\r\nAssuredly no, there was nothing morbid about her. Would one even\r\n(wondered the Duke, for a disloyal instant) go so far as to say she was\r\nheartless? Ah no, she was merely strong. She was one who could tread the\r\ntragic plane without stumbling, and be resilient in the valley of the\r\nshadow. What she had just said was no more than the truth: she would\r\nhave loved to die for him, had he not forfeited her heart. She would\r\nhave asked no tears. That she had none to shed for him now, that she did\r\nbut share his exhilaration, was the measure of her worthiness to have\r\nthe homage of his self-slaughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to ask one little favour of you.\r\nWill you, please, at the last moment to-morrow, call out my name in a\r\nloud voice, so that every one around can hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that no one shall ever be able to say it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for me that you\r\ndied, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I use simply your Christian name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I really don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t--at such a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you.\xe2\x80\x9d His face glowed.\r\n\r\nThus did they commune, these two, radiant without and within. And behind\r\nthem, throughout the Hall, the undergraduates craned their necks for\r\na glimpse. The Duke\xe2\x80\x99s piano solo, which was the last item in the first\r\nhalf of the programme, was eagerly awaited. Already, whispered first\r\nfrom the lips of Oover and the others who had come on from the Junta,\r\nthe news of his resolve had gone from ear to ear among the men. He, for\r\nhis part, had forgotten the scene at the Junta, the baleful effect of\r\nhis example. For him the Hall was a cave of solitude--no one there but\r\nZuleika and himself. Yet almost, like the late Mr. John Bright, he heard\r\nin the air the beating of the wings of the Angel of Death. Not awful\r\nwings; little wings that sprouted from the shoulders of a rosy and\r\nblindfold child. Love and Death--for him they were exquisitely one. And\r\nit seemed to him, when his turn came to play, that he floated, rather\r\nthan walked, to the dais.\r\n\r\nHe had not considered what he would play tonight. Nor, maybe, was he\r\nconscious now of choosing. His fingers caressed the keyboard vaguely;\r\nand anon this ivory had voice and language; and for its master, and for\r\nsome of his hearers, arose a vision. And it was as though in delicate\r\nprocession, very slowly, listless with weeping, certain figures passed\r\nby, hooded, and drooping forasmuch as by the loss of him whom they were\r\nfollowing to his grave their own hold on life had been loosened. He\r\nhad been so beautiful and young. Lo, he was but a burden to be carried\r\nhence, dust to be hidden out of sight. Very slowly, very wretchedly they\r\nwent by. But, as they went, another feeling, faint at first, an all but\r\nimperceptible current, seemed to flow through the procession; and now\r\none, now another of the mourners would look wanly up, with cast-back\r\nhood, as though listening; and anon all were listening on their way,\r\nfirst in wonder, then in rapture; for the soul of their friend was\r\nsinging to them: they heard his voice, but clearer and more blithe than\r\nthey had ever known it--a voice etherealised by a triumph of joy that\r\nwas not yet for them to share. But presently the voice receded, its\r\nechoes dying away into the sphere whence it came. It ceased; and the\r\nmourners were left alone again with their sorrow, and passed on all\r\nunsolaced, and drooping, weeping.\r\n\r\nSoon after the Duke had begun to play, an invisible figure came and\r\nstood by and listened; a frail man, dressed in the fashion of 1840; the\r\nshade of none other than Frederic Chopin. Behind whom, a moment later,\r\ncame a woman of somewhat masculine aspect and dominant demeanour,\r\nmounting guard over him, and, as it were, ready to catch him if he fell.\r\nHe bowed his head lower and lower, he looked up with an ecstasy more\r\nand more intense, according to the procedure of his Marche Funebre. And\r\namong the audience, too, there was a bowing and uplifting of heads, just\r\nas among the figures of the mourners evoked. Yet the head of the player\r\nhimself was all the while erect, and his face glad and serene. Nobly\r\nsensitive as was his playing of the mournful passages, he smiled\r\nbrilliantly through them.\r\n\r\nAnd Zuleika returned his gaze with a smile not less gay. She was not\r\nsure what he was playing. But she assumed that it was for her, and that\r\nthe music had some reference to his impending death. She was one of the\r\npeople who say \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about music really, but I know\r\nwhat I like.\xe2\x80\x9d And she liked this; and she beat time to it with her fan.\r\nShe thought her Duke looked very handsome. She was proud of him. Strange\r\nthat this time yesterday she had been wildly in love with him! Strange,\r\ntoo, that this time to-morrow he would be dead! She was immensely glad\r\nshe had saved him this afternoon. To-morrow! There came back to her what\r\nhe had told her about the omen at Tankerton, that stately home: \xe2\x80\x9cOn the\r\neve of the death of a Duke of Dorset, two black owls come always and\r\nperch on the battlements. They remain there through the night, hooting.\r\nAt dawn they fly away, none knows whither.\xe2\x80\x9d Perhaps, thought she, at\r\nthis very moment these two birds were on the battlements.\r\n\r\nThe music ceased. In the hush that followed it, her applause rang sharp\r\nand notable. Not so Chopin\xe2\x80\x99s. Of him and his intense excitement none but\r\nhis companion was aware. \xe2\x80\x9cPlus fin que Pachmann!\xe2\x80\x9d he reiterated, waving\r\nhis arms wildly, and dancing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTu auras une migraine affreuse. Rentrons, petit coeur!\xe2\x80\x9d said George\r\nSand, gently but firmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaisse-moi le saluer,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the composer, struggling in her grasp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDemain soir, oui. Il sera parmi nous,\xe2\x80\x9d said the novelist, as she\r\nhurried him away. \xe2\x80\x9cMoi aussi,\xe2\x80\x9d she added to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cje me promets un\r\nbeau plaisir en faisant la connaissance de ce jeune homme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZuleika was the first to rise as \xe2\x80\x9cce jeune homme\xe2\x80\x9d came down from the\r\ndais. Now was the interval between the two parts of the programme.\r\nThere was a general creaking and scraping of pushed-back chairs as the\r\naudience rose and went forth into the night. The noise aroused from\r\nsleep the good Warden, who, having peered at his programme, complimented\r\nthe Duke with old-world courtesy and went to sleep again. Zuleika,\r\nthrusting her fan under one arm, shook the player by both hands. Also,\r\nshe told him that she knew nothing about music really, but that she\r\nknew what she liked. As she passed with him up the aisle, she said this\r\nagain. People who say it are never tired of saying it.\r\n\r\nOutside, the crowd was greater than ever. All the undergraduates from\r\nall the Colleges seemed now to be concentrated in the great Front\r\nQuadrangle of Judas. Even in the glow of the Japanese lanterns that hung\r\naround in honour of the concert, the faces of the lads looked a little\r\npale. For it was known by all now that the Duke was to die. Even while\r\nthe concert was in progress, the news had spread out from the Hall,\r\nthrough the thronged doorway, down the thronged steps, to the confines\r\nof the crowd. Nor had Oover and the other men from the Junta made any\r\nsecret of their own determination. And now, as the rest saw Zuleika\r\nyet again at close quarters, and verified their remembrance of her, the\r\nhalf-formed desire in them to die too was hardened to a vow.\r\n\r\nYou cannot make a man by standing a sheep on its hind-legs. But by\r\nstanding a flock of sheep in that position you can make a crowd of men.\r\nIf man were not a gregarious animal, the world might have achieved, by\r\nthis time, some real progress towards civilisation. Segregate him, and\r\nhe is no fool. But let him loose among his fellows, and he is lost--he\r\nbecomes just an unit in unreason. If any one of the undergraduates had\r\nmet Miss Dobson in the desert of Sahara, he would have fallen in love\r\nwith her; but not one in a thousand of them would have wished to die\r\nbecause she did not love him. The Duke\xe2\x80\x99s was a peculiar case. For him to\r\nfall in love was itself a violent peripety, bound to produce a violent\r\nupheaval; and such was his pride that for his love to be unrequited\r\nwould naturally enamour him of death. These other, these quite ordinary,\r\nyoung men were the victims less of Zuleika than of the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s example,\r\nand of one another. A crowd, proportionately to its size, magnifies all\r\nthat in its units pertains to the emotions, and diminishes all that in\r\nthem pertains to thought. It was because these undergraduates were a\r\ncrowd that their passion for Zuleika was so intense; and it was because\r\nthey were a crowd that they followed so blindly the lead given to them.\r\nTo die for Miss Dobson was \xe2\x80\x9cthe thing to do.\xe2\x80\x9d The Duke was going to do\r\nit. The Junta was going to do it. It is a hateful fact, but we must face\r\nthe fact, that snobbishness was one of the springs to the tragedy here\r\nchronicled.\r\n\r\nWe may set to this crowd\xe2\x80\x99s credit that it refrained now from following\r\nZuleika. Not one of the ladies present was deserted by her escort. All\r\nthe men recognised the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s right to be alone with Zuleika now. We may\r\nset also to their credit that they carefully guarded the ladies from all\r\nknowledge of what was afoot.\r\n\r\nSide by side, the great lover and his beloved wandered away, beyond the\r\nlight of the Japanese lanterns, and came to Salt Cellar.\r\n\r\nThe moon, like a gardenia in the night\xe2\x80\x99s button-hole--but no! why should\r\na writer never be able to mention the moon without likening her to\r\nsomething else--usually something to which she bears not the faintest\r\nresemblance?... The moon, looking like nothing whatsoever but herself,\r\nwas engaged in her old and futile endeavour to mark the hours correctly\r\non the sun-dial at the centre of the lawn. Never, except once, late one\r\nnight in the eighteenth century, when the toper who was Sub-Warden had\r\nspent an hour in trying to set his watch here, had she received the\r\nslightest encouragement. Still she wanly persisted. And this was the\r\nmore absurd in her because Salt Cellar offered very good scope for those\r\nlegitimate effects of hers which we one and all admire. Was it nothing\r\nto her to have cut those black shadows across the cloisters? Was\r\nit nothing to her that she so magically mingled her rays with the\r\ncandle-light shed forth from Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom? Nothing, that she\r\nhad cleansed the lawn of all its colour, and made of it a platform of\r\nsilver-grey, fit for fairies to dance on?\r\n\r\nIf Zuleika, as she paced the gravel path, had seen how transfigured--how\r\nnobly like the Tragic Muse--she was just now, she could not have gone on\r\nbothering the Duke for a keepsake of the tragedy that was to be.\r\n\r\nShe was still set on having his two studs. He was still firm in his\r\nrefusal to misappropriate those heirlooms. In vain she pointed out to\r\nhim that the pearls he meant, the white ones, no longer existed; that\r\nthe pearls he was wearing were no more \xe2\x80\x9centailed\xe2\x80\x9d than if he had got\r\nthem yesterday. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you actually DID get them yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd from me. And I want them back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are ingenious,\xe2\x80\x9d he admitted. \xe2\x80\x9cI, in my simple way, am but head of\r\nthe Tanville-Tankerton family. Had you accepted my offer of marriage,\r\nyou would have had the right to wear these two pearls during your\r\nlife-time. I am very happy to die for you. But tamper with the property\r\nof my successor I cannot and will not. I am sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSorry!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Zuleika. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, and you were \xe2\x80\x98sorry\xe2\x80\x99 you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t dine\r\nwith me to-night. But any little niggling scruple is more to you than I\r\nam. What old maids men are!\xe2\x80\x9d And viciously with her fan she struck one\r\nof the cloister pillars.\r\n\r\nHer outburst was lost on the Duke. At her taunt about his not dining\r\nwith her, he had stood still, clapping one hand to his brow. The events\r\nof the early evening swept back to him--his speech, its unforeseen and\r\nhorrible reception. He saw again the preternaturally solemn face of\r\nOover, and the flushed faces of the rest. He had thought, as he pointed\r\ndown to the abyss over which he stood, these fellows would recoil,\r\nand pull themselves together. They had recoiled, and pulled themselves\r\ntogether, only in the manner of athletes about to spring. He was\r\nresponsible for them. His own life was his to lose: others he must\r\nnot squander. Besides, he had reckoned to die alone, unique; aloft and\r\napart... \xe2\x80\x9cThere is something--something I had forgotten,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to\r\nZuleika, \xe2\x80\x9csomething that will be a great shock to you\xe2\x80\x9d; and he gave her\r\nan outline of what had passed at the Junta.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are sure they really MEANT it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked in a voice that\r\ntrembled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear so. But they were over-excited. They will recant their folly. I\r\nshall force them to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are not children. You yourself have just been calling them \xe2\x80\x98men.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nWhy should they obey you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned at sound of a footstep, and saw a young man approaching. He\r\nwore a coat like the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s, and in his hand he dangled a handkerchief.\r\nHe bowed awkwardly, and, holding out the handkerchief, said to her \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nbeg your pardon, but I think you dropped this. I have just picked it\r\nup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZuleika looked at the handkerchief, which was obviously a man\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\nsmilingly shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you know The MacQuern,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, with sulky grace.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the intruder, \xe2\x80\x9cis Miss Dobson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is it really true,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Zuleika, retaining The MacQuern\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat you want to die for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, the Scots are a self-seeking and a resolute, but a shy, race;\r\nswift to act, when swiftness is needed, but seldom knowing quite what to\r\nsay. The MacQuern, with native reluctance to give something for nothing,\r\nhad determined to have the pleasure of knowing the young lady for whom\r\nhe was to lay down his life; and this purpose he had, by the simple\r\nstratagem of his own handkerchief, achieved. Nevertheless, in answer to\r\nZuleika\xe2\x80\x99s question, and with the pressure of her hand to inspire him,\r\nthe only word that rose to his lips was \xe2\x80\x9cAy\xe2\x80\x9d (which may be roughly\r\ntranslated as \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will do nothing of the sort,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the Duke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zuleika, still retaining The MacQuern\xe2\x80\x99s hand, \xe2\x80\x9cyou see, it\r\nis forbidden. You must not defy our dear little Duke. He is not used to\r\nit. It is not done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said The MacQuern, with a stony glance at the Duke,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat he has anything to do with the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is older and wiser than you. More a man of the world. Regard him as\r\nyour tutor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo YOU want me not to die for you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, _I_ should not dare to impose my wishes on you,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, dropping\r\nhis hand. \xe2\x80\x9cEven,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cif I knew what my wishes were. And I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t. I know only that I think it is very, very beautiful of you to\r\nthink of dying for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen that settles it,\xe2\x80\x9d said The MacQuern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! You must not let yourself be influenced by ME. Besides, I am\r\nnot in a mood to influence anybody. I am overwhelmed. Tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, heedless of the Duke, who stood tapping his heel on the ground,\r\nwith every manifestation of disapproval and impatience, \xe2\x80\x9ctell me, is it\r\ntrue that some of the other men love me too, and--feel as you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe MacQuern said cautiously that he could answer for no one but\r\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d he allowed, \xe2\x80\x9cI saw a good many men whom I know, outside\r\nthe Hall here, just now, and they seemed to have made up their minds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo die for me? To-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow. After the Eights, I suppose; at the same time as the Duke.\r\nIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do to leave the races undecided.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf COURSE not. But the poor dears! It is too touching! I have done\r\nnothing, nothing to deserve it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing whatsoever,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke drily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh HE,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zuleika, \xe2\x80\x9cthinks me an unredeemed brute; just because I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t love him. YOU, dear Mr. MacQuern--does one call you \xe2\x80\x98Mr.\xe2\x80\x99? \xe2\x80\x98The\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwould sound so odd in the vocative. And I can\xe2\x80\x99t very well call you\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MacQuern\xe2\x80\x99--YOU don\xe2\x80\x99t think me unkind, do you? I simply can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to\r\nthink of all these young lives cut short without my having done a thing\r\nto brighten them. What can I do?--what can I do to show my gratitude?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn idea struck her. She looked up to the lit window of her room.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMelisande!\xe2\x80\x9d she called.\r\n\r\nA figure appeared at the window. \xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle desire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy tricks, Melisande! Bring down the box, quick!\xe2\x80\x9d She turned excitedly\r\nto the two young men. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is all I can do in return, you see. If I could\r\ndance for them, I would. If I could sing, I would sing to them. I do\r\nwhat I can. You,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cmust go on to the platform and\r\nannounce it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnnounce what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that I am going to do my tricks! All you need say is \xe2\x80\x98Ladies and\r\ngentlemen, I have the pleasure to--\xe2\x80\x99 What is the matter now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou make me feel slightly unwell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd YOU are the most d-dis-disobliging and the unkindest and the\r\nb-beastliest person I ever met,\xe2\x80\x9d Zuleika sobbed at him through her\r\nhands. The MacQuern glared reproaches at him. So did Melisande, who had\r\njust appeared through the postern, holding in her arms the great casket\r\nof malachite. A painful scene; and the Duke gave in. He said he would do\r\nanything--anything. Peace was restored.\r\n\r\nThe MacQuern had relieved Melisande of her burden; and to him was the\r\nprivilege of bearing it, in procession with his adored and her quelled\r\nmentor, towards the Hall.\r\n\r\nZuleika babbled like a child going to a juvenile party. This was the\r\ngreat night, as yet, in her life. Illustrious enough already it had\r\nseemed to her, as eve of that ultimate flattery vowed her by the Duke.\r\nSo fine a thing had his doom seemed to her--his doom alone--that it had\r\nsufficed to flood her pink pearl with the right hue. And now not on him\r\nalone need she ponder. Now he was but the centre of a group--a group\r\nthat might grow and grow--a group that might with a little encouragement\r\nbe a multitude... With such hopes dimly whirling in the recesses of her\r\nsoul, her beautiful red lips babbled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nSounds of a violin, drifting out through the open windows of the\r\nHall, suggested that the second part of the concert had begun. All the\r\nundergraduates, however, except the few who figured in the programme,\r\nhad waited outside till their mistress should re-appear. The sisters\r\nand cousins of the Judas men had been escorted back to their places and\r\nhurriedly left there.\r\n\r\nIt was a hushed, tense crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor darlings!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Zuleika, pausing to survey them. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd oh,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cthere won\xe2\x80\x99t be room for all of them in there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might give an \xe2\x80\x98overflow\xe2\x80\x99 performance out here afterwards,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n suggested the Duke, grimly.\r\n\r\nThis idea flashed on her a better. Why not give her performance here and\r\nnow?--now, so eager was she for contact, as it were, with this crowd;\r\nhere, by moonlight, in the pretty glow of these paper lanterns. Yes,\r\nshe said, let it be here and now; and she bade the Duke make the\r\nannouncement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I say?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen, I have the pleasure to\r\nannounce that Miss Zuleika Dobson, the world-renowned She-Wizard, will\r\nnow oblige\xe2\x80\x99? Or shall I call them \xe2\x80\x98Gents,\xe2\x80\x99 tout court?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could afford to laugh at his ill-humour. She had his promise of\r\nobedience. She told him to say something graceful and simple.\r\n\r\nThe noise of the violin had ceased. There was not a breath of wind. The\r\ncrowd in the quadrangle was as still and as silent as the night itself.\r\nNowhere a tremour. And it was borne in on Zuleika that this crowd had\r\none mind as well as one heart--a common resolve, calm and clear, as well\r\nas a common passion. No need for her to strengthen the spell now. No\r\nwaverers here. And thus it came true that gratitude was the sole motive\r\nfor her display.\r\n\r\nShe stood with eyes downcast and hands folded behind her, moonlit in\r\nthe glow of lanterns, modest to the point of pathos, while the Duke\r\ngracefully and simply introduced her to the multitude. He was, he said,\r\nempowered by the lady who stood beside him to say that she would be\r\npleased to give them an exhibition of her skill in the art to which\r\nshe had devoted her life--an art which, more potently perhaps than any\r\nother, touched in mankind the sense of mystery and stirred the faculty\r\nof wonder; the most truly romantic of all the arts: he referred to the\r\nart of conjuring. It was not too much to say that by her mastery of this\r\nart, in which hitherto, it must be confessed, women had made no very\r\ngreat mark, Miss Zuleika Dobson (for such was the name of the lady who\r\nstood beside him) had earned the esteem of the whole civilised world.\r\nAnd here in Oxford, and in this College especially, she had a peculiar\r\nclaim to--might he say?--their affectionate regard, inasmuch as she was\r\nthe grand-daughter of their venerable and venerated Warden.\r\n\r\nAs the Duke ceased, there came from his hearers a sound like the\r\nrustling of leaves. In return for it, Zuleika performed that graceful\r\nact of subsidence to the verge of collapse which is usually kept for the\r\ndelectation of some royal person. And indeed, in the presence of this\r\ndoomed congress, she did experience humility; for she was not altogether\r\nwithout imagination. But, as she arose from her \xe2\x80\x9cbob,\xe2\x80\x9d she was her own\r\nbold self again, bright mistress of the situation.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for her to give her entertainment in full. Some of her\r\ntricks (notably the Secret Aquarium, and the Blazing Ball of Worsted)\r\nneeded special preparation, and a table fitted with a \xe2\x80\x9cservante\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\nsecret tray. The table for to-night\xe2\x80\x99s performance was an ordinary one,\r\nbrought out from the porter\xe2\x80\x99s lodge. The MacQuern deposited on it the\r\ngreat casket. Zuleika, retaining him as her assistant, picked nimbly\r\nout from their places and put in array the curious appurtenances of her\r\nart--the Magic Canister, the Demon Egg-Cup, and the sundry other vessels\r\nwhich, lost property of young Edward Gibbs, had been by a Romanoff\r\ntransmuted from wood to gold, and were now by the moon reduced\r\ntemporarily to silver.\r\n\r\nIn a great dense semicircle the young men disposed themselves around\r\nher. Those who were in front squatted down on the gravel; those who were\r\nbehind knelt; the rest stood. Young Oxford! Here, in this mass of boyish\r\nfaces, all fused and obliterated, was the realisation of that phrase.\r\nTwo or three thousands of human bodies, human souls? Yet the effect of\r\nthem in the moonlight was as of one great passive monster.\r\n\r\nSo was it seen by the Duke, as he stood leaning against the wall,\r\nbehind Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s table. He saw it as a monster couchant and enchanted,\r\na monster that was to die; and its death was in part his own doing.\r\nBut remorse in him gave place to hostility. Zuleika had begun her\r\nperformance. She was producing the Barber\xe2\x80\x99s Pole from her mouth. And\r\nit was to her that the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s heart went suddenly out in tenderness\r\nand pity. He forgot her levity and vanity--her wickedness, as he had\r\ninwardly called it. He thrilled with that intense anxiety which comes to\r\na man when he sees his beloved offering to the public an exhibition of\r\nher skill, be it in singing, acting, dancing, or any other art. Would\r\nshe acquit herself well? The lover\xe2\x80\x99s trepidation is painful enough when\r\nthe beloved has genius--how should these clods appreciate her? and who\r\nset them in judgment over her? It must be worse when the beloved has\r\nmediocrity. And Zuleika, in conjuring, had rather less than that. Though\r\nindeed she took herself quite seriously as a conjurer, she brought to\r\nher art neither conscience nor ambition, in any true sense of those\r\nwords. Since her debut, she had learned nothing and forgotten nothing.\r\nThe stale and narrow repertory which she had acquired from Edward Gibbs\r\nwas all she had to offer; and this, and her marked lack of skill, she\r\neked out with the self-same \xe2\x80\x9cpatter\xe2\x80\x9d that had sufficed that impossible\r\nyoung man. It was especially her jokes that now sent shudders up the\r\nspine of her lover, and brought tears to his eyes, and kept him in\r\na state of terror as to what she would say next. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d she had\r\nexclaimed lightly after the production of the Barber\xe2\x80\x99s Pole, \xe2\x80\x9chow easy\r\nit is to set up business as a hairdresser.\xe2\x80\x9d Over the Demon Egg-Cup she\r\nsaid that the egg was \xe2\x80\x9cas good as fresh.\xe2\x80\x9d And her constantly reiterated\r\ncatch-phrase--\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this is rather queer!\xe2\x80\x9d--was the most distressing\r\nthing of all.\r\n\r\nThe Duke blushed to think what these men thought of her. Would love\r\nwere blind! These her lovers were doubtless judging her. They forgave\r\nher--confound their impudence!--because of her beauty. The banality of\r\nher performance was an added grace. It made her piteous. Damn them, they\r\nwere sorry for her. Little Noaks was squatting in the front row, peering\r\nup at her through his spectacles. Noaks was as sorry for her as the rest\r\nof them. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the earth yawn and swallow them all up?\r\n\r\nOur hero\xe2\x80\x99s unreasoning rage was fed by a not unreasonable jealousy. It\r\nwas clear to him that Zuleika had forgotten his existence. To-day, as\r\nsoon as he had killed her love, she had shown him how much less to her\r\nwas his love than the crowd\xe2\x80\x99s. And now again it was only the crowd she\r\ncared for. He followed with his eyes her long slender figure as she\r\nthreaded her way in and out of the crowd, sinuously, confidingly,\r\nproducing a penny from one lad\xe2\x80\x99s elbow, a threepenny-bit from between\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s neck and collar, half a crown from another\xe2\x80\x99s hair, and always\r\nrepeating in that flute-like voice of hers \xe2\x80\x9cWell, this is rather queer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Hither and thither she fared, her neck and arms gleaming white from the\r\nluminous blackness of her dress, in the luminous blueness of the night.\r\nAt a distance, she might have been a wraith; or a breeze made visible; a\r\nvagrom breeze, warm and delicate, and in league with death.\r\n\r\nYes, that is how she might have seemed to a casual observer. But to the\r\nDuke there was nothing weird about her: she was radiantly a woman; a\r\ngoddess; and his first and last love. Bitter his heart was, but only\r\nagainst the mob she wooed, not against her for wooing it. She was cruel?\r\nAll goddesses are that. She was demeaning herself? His soul welled up\r\nanew in pity, in passion.\r\n\r\nYonder, in the Hall, the concert ran its course, making a feeble\r\nincidental music to the dark emotions of the quadrangle. It ended\r\nsomewhat before the close of Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s rival show; and then the steps\r\nfrom the Hall were thronged by ladies, who, with a sprinkling of dons,\r\nstood in attitudes of refined displeasure and vulgar curiosity. The\r\nWarden was just awake enough to notice the sea of undergraduates.\r\nSuspecting some breach of College discipline, he retired hastily to his\r\nown quarters, for fear his dignity might be somehow compromised.\r\n\r\nWas there ever, I wonder, an historian so pure as not to have wished\r\njust once to fob off on his readers just one bright fable for effect?\r\nI find myself sorely tempted to tell you that on Zuleika, as her\r\nentertainment drew to a close, the spirit of the higher thaumaturgy\r\ndescended like a flame and found in her a worthy agent. Specious\r\nApollyon whispers to me \xe2\x80\x9cWhere would be the harm? Tell your readers\r\nthat she cast a seed on the ground, and that therefrom presently arose\r\na tamarind-tree which blossomed and bore fruit and, withering, vanished.\r\nOr say she conjured from an empty basket of osier a hissing and bridling\r\nsnake. Why not? Your readers would be excited, gratified. And you would\r\nnever be found out.\xe2\x80\x9d But the grave eyes of Clio are bent on me, her\r\nservant. Oh pardon, madam: I did but waver for an instant. It is not too\r\nlate to tell my readers that the climax of Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s entertainment was\r\nonly that dismal affair, the Magic Canister.\r\n\r\nIt she took from the table, and, holding it aloft, cried \xe2\x80\x9cNow, before I\r\nsay good night, I want to see if I have your confidence. But you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink this is the confidence trick!\xe2\x80\x9d She handed the vessel to The\r\nMacQuern, who, looking like an overgrown acolyte, bore it after her as\r\nshe went again among the audience. Pausing before a man in the front\r\nrow, she asked him if he would trust her with his watch. He held it\r\nout to her. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, letting her fingers touch his for a\r\nmoment before she dropped it into the Magic Canister. From another man\r\nshe borrowed a cigarette-case, from another a neck-tie, from another a\r\npair of sleeve-links, from Noaks a ring--one of those iron rings which\r\nare supposed, rightly or wrongly, to alleviate rheumatism. And when she\r\nhad made an ample selection, she began her return-journey to the table.\r\n\r\nOn her way she saw in the shadow of the wall the figure of her forgotten\r\nDuke. She saw him, the one man she had ever loved, also the first\r\nman who had wished definitely to die for her; and she was touched by\r\nremorse. She had said she would remember him to her dying day; and\r\nalready... But had he not refused her the wherewithal to remember\r\nhim--the pearls she needed as the clou of her dear collection, the great\r\nrelic among relics?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you trust me with your studs?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked him, in a voice that\r\ncould be heard throughout the quadrangle, with a smile that was for him\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nThere was no help for it. He quickly extricated from his shirt-front the\r\nblack pearl and the pink. Her thanks had a special emphasis.\r\n\r\nThe MacQuern placed the Magic Canister before her on the table. She\r\npressed the outer sheath down on it. Then she inverted it so that the\r\ncontents fell into the false lid; then she opened it, looked into it,\r\nand, exclaiming \xe2\x80\x9cWell, this is rather queer!\xe2\x80\x9d held it up so that the\r\naudience whose intelligence she was insulting might see there was\r\nnothing in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccidents,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwill happen in the best-regulated canisters!\r\nBut I think there is just a chance that I shall be able to restore your\r\nproperty. Excuse me for a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d She then shut the canister, released\r\nthe false lid, made several passes over it, opened it, looked into it\r\nand said with a flourish \xe2\x80\x9cNow I can clear my character!\xe2\x80\x9d Again she went\r\namong the crowd, attended by The MacQuern; and the loans--priceless now\r\nbecause she had touched them--were in due course severally restored.\r\nWhen she took the canister from her acolyte, only the two studs remained\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nNot since the night of her flitting from the Gibbs\xe2\x80\x99 humble home had\r\nZuleika thieved. Was she a back-slider? Would she rob the Duke, and his\r\nheir-presumptive, and Tanville-Tankertons yet unborn? Alas, yes. But\r\nwhat she now did was proof that she had qualms. And her way of doing it\r\nshowed that for legerdemain she had after all a natural aptitude which,\r\nproperly trained, might have won for her an honourable place in at least\r\nthe second rank of contemporary prestidigitators. With a gesture of her\r\ndisengaged hand, so swift as to be scarcely visible, she unhooked her\r\near-rings and \xe2\x80\x9cpassed\xe2\x80\x9d them into the canister. This she did as she\r\nturned away from the crowd, on her way to the Duke. At the same moment,\r\nin a manner technically not less good, though morally deplorable, she\r\nwithdrew the studs and \xe2\x80\x9cvanished\xe2\x80\x9d them into her bosom.\r\n\r\nWas it triumph, or shame, or of both a little that so flushed her cheeks\r\nas she stood before the man she had robbed? Or was it the excitement\r\nof giving a present to the man she had loved? Certain it is that the\r\nnakedness of her ears gave a new look to her face--a primitive look,\r\nopen and sweetly wild. The Duke saw the difference, without noticing\r\nthe cause. She was more adorable than ever. He blenched and swayed as in\r\nproximity to a loveliness beyond endurance. His heart cried out within\r\nhim. A sudden mist came over his eyes.\r\n\r\nIn the canister that she held out to him, the two pearls rattled like\r\ndice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep them!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered back, almost shyly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut these, these are for\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d And she took one of his hands, and, holding it open, tilted the\r\ncanister over it, and let drop into it the two ear-rings, and went\r\nquickly away.\r\n\r\nAs she re-appeared at the table, the crowd gave her a long ovation\r\nof gratitude for her performance--an ovation all the more impressive\r\nbecause it was solemn and subdued. She curtseyed again and again, not\r\nindeed with the timid simplicity of her first obeisance (so familiar\r\nalready was she with the thought of the crowd\xe2\x80\x99s doom), but rather in the\r\nmanner of a prima donna--chin up, eyelids down, all teeth manifest, and\r\nhands from the bosom flung ecstatically wide asunder.\r\n\r\nYou know how, at a concert, a prima donna who has just sung insists on\r\nshaking hands with the accompanist, and dragging him forward, to show\r\nhow beautiful her nature is, into the applause that is for herself\r\nalone. And your heart, like mine, has gone out to the wretched victim.\r\nEven so would you have felt for The MacQuern when Zuleika, on the\r\nimplied assumption that half the credit was his, grasped him by the\r\nwrist, and, continuing to curtsey, would not release him till the last\r\nechoes of the clapping had died away.\r\n\r\nThe ladies on the steps of the Hall moved down into the quadrangle,\r\nspreading their resentment like a miasma. The tragic passion of the\r\ncrowd was merged in mere awkwardness. There was a general movement\r\ntowards the College gate.\r\n\r\nZuleika was putting her tricks back into the great casket, The MacQuern\r\nassisting her. The Scots, as I have said, are a shy race, but a resolute\r\nand a self-seeking. This young chieftain had not yet recovered from what\r\nhis heroine had let him in for. But he did not lose the opportunity of\r\nasking her to lunch with him to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDelighted,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, fitting the Demon Egg-Cup into its groove.\r\nThen, looking up at him, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you popular?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you many\r\nfriends?\xe2\x80\x9d He nodded. She said he must invite them all.\r\n\r\nThis was a blow to the young man, who, at once thrifty and infatuate,\r\nhad planned a luncheon a deux. \xe2\x80\x9cI had hoped--\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVainly,\xe2\x80\x9d she cut him short.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cWhom shall I invite, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know any of them. How should I have preferences?\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nremembered the Duke. She looked round and saw him still standing in the\r\nshadow of the wall. He came towards her. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d she said hastily\r\nto her host, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must ask HIM.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe MacQuern complied. He turned to the Duke and told him that Miss\r\nDobson had very kindly promised to lunch with him to-morrow. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nZuleika, \xe2\x80\x9cI simply WON\xe2\x80\x99T unless you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke looked at her. Had it not been arranged that he and she should\r\nspend his last day together? Did it mean nothing that she had given him\r\nher ear-rings? Quickly drawing about him some remnants of his tattered\r\npride, he hid his wound, and accepted the invitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems a shame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zuleika to The MacQuern, \xe2\x80\x9cto ask you to bring\r\nthis great heavy box all the way back again. But--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose last poor rags of pride fell away now. The Duke threw a prehensile\r\nhand on the casket, and, coldly glaring at The MacQuern, pointed with\r\nhis other hand towards the College gate. He, and he alone, was going to\r\nsee Zuleika home. It was his last night on earth, and he was not to be\r\ntrifled with. Such was the message of his eyes. The Scotsman\xe2\x80\x99s flashed\r\nback a precisely similar message.\r\n\r\nMen had fought for Zuleika, but never in her presence. Her eyes dilated.\r\nShe had not the slightest impulse to throw herself between the two\r\nantagonists. Indeed, she stepped back, so as not to be in the way. A\r\nshort sharp fight--how much better that is than bad blood! She hoped the\r\nbetter man would win; and (do not misjudge her) she rather hoped this\r\nman was the Duke. It occurred to her--a vague memory of some play or\r\npicture--that she ought to be holding aloft a candelabra of lit tapers;\r\nno, that was only done indoors, and in the eighteenth century. Ought\r\nshe to hold a sponge? Idle, these speculations of hers, and based on\r\ncomplete ignorance of the manners and customs of undergraduates. The\r\nDuke and The MacQuern would never have come to blows in the presence of\r\na lady. Their conflict was necessarily spiritual.\r\n\r\nAnd it was the Scotsman, Scots though he was, who had to yield. Cowed\r\nby something demoniac in the will-power pitted against his, he found\r\nhimself retreating in the direction indicated by the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s forefinger.\r\n\r\nAs he disappeared into the porch, Zuleika turned to the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were\r\nsplendid,\xe2\x80\x9d she said softly. He knew that very well. Does the stag in his\r\nhour of victory need a diploma from the hind? Holding in his hands the\r\nmalachite casket that was the symbol of his triumph, the Duke smiled\r\ndictatorially at his darling. He came near to thinking of her as a\r\nchattel. Then with a pang he remembered his abject devotion to her.\r\nAbject no longer though! The victory he had just won restored his\r\nmanhood, his sense of supremacy among his fellows. He loved this woman\r\non equal terms. She was transcendent? So was he, Dorset. To-night\r\nthe world had on its moonlit surface two great ornaments--Zuleika and\r\nhimself. Neither of the pair could be replaced. Was one of them to be\r\nshattered? Life and love were good. He had been mad to think of dying.\r\n\r\nNo word was spoken as they went together to Salt Cellar. She expected\r\nhim to talk about her conjuring tricks. Could he have been disappointed?\r\nShe dared not inquire; for she had the sensitiveness, though no other\r\nquality whatsoever, of the true artist. She felt herself aggrieved. She\r\nhad half a mind to ask him to give her back her ear-rings. And by the\r\nway, he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet thanked her for them! Well, she would make allowances\r\nfor a condemned man. And again she remembered the omen of which he had\r\ntold her. She looked at him, and then up into the sky. \xe2\x80\x9cThis same moon,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said to herself, \xe2\x80\x9csees the battlements of Tankerton. Does she see\r\ntwo black owls there? Does she hear them hooting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were in Salt Cellar now. \xe2\x80\x9cMelisande!\xe2\x80\x9d she called up to her window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cI have something to say to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you can say it all the better without that great box in your\r\nhands. I want my maid to carry it up to my room for me.\xe2\x80\x9d And again she\r\ncalled out for Melisande, and received no answer. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose she\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nthe house-keeper\xe2\x80\x99s room or somewhere. You had better put the box down\r\ninside the door. She can bring it up later.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pushed open the postern; and the Duke, as he stepped across the\r\nthreshold, thrilled with a romantic awe. Re-emerging a moment later into\r\nthe moonlight, he felt that she had been right about the box: it was\r\nfatal to self-expression; and he was glad he had not tried to speak\r\non the way from the Front Quad: the soul needs gesture; and the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfirst gesture now was to seize Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s hands in his.\r\n\r\nShe was too startled to move. \xe2\x80\x9cZuleika!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. She was too angry\r\nto speak, but with a sudden twist she freed her wrists and darted back.\r\n\r\nHe laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are afraid of me. You are afraid to let me kiss you,\r\nbecause you are afraid of loving me. This afternoon--here--I all but\r\nkissed you. I mistook you for Death. I was enamoured of Death. I was a\r\nfool. That is what YOU are, you incomparable darling: you are a fool.\r\nYou are afraid of life. I am not. I love life. I am going to live for\r\nyou, do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stood with her back to the postern. Anger in her eyes had given\r\nplace to scorn. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you go back on your\r\npromise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will release me from it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean you are afraid to die?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not be guilty of my death. You love me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood night, you miserable coward.\xe2\x80\x9d She stepped back through the\r\npostern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, Zuleika! Miss Dobson, don\xe2\x80\x99t! Pull yourself together! Reflect! I\r\nimplore you... You will repent...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSlowly she closed the postern on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will repent. I shall wait here, under your window...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe heard a bolt rasped into its socket. He heard the retreat of a light\r\ntread on the paven hall.\r\n\r\nAnd he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even kissed her! That was his first thought. He ground his\r\nheel in the gravel.\r\n\r\nAnd he had hurt her wrists! This was Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s first thought, as she\r\ncame into her bedroom. Yes, there were two red marks where he had\r\nheld her. No man had ever dared to lay hands on her. With a sense of\r\ncontamination, she proceeded to wash her hands thoroughly with soap and\r\nwater. From time to time such words as \xe2\x80\x9ccad\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbeast\xe2\x80\x9d came through\r\nher teeth.\r\n\r\nShe dried her hands and flung herself into a chair, arose and went\r\npacing the room. So this was the end of her great night! What had she\r\ndone to deserve it? How had he dared?\r\n\r\nThere was a sound as of rain against the window. She was glad. The night\r\nneeded cleansing.\r\n\r\nHe had told her she was afraid of life. Life!--to have herself caressed\r\nby HIM; humbly to devote herself to being humbly doted on; to be the\r\nslave of a slave; to swim in a private pond of treacle--ugh! If the\r\nthought weren\xe2\x80\x99t so cloying and degrading, it would be laughable.\r\n\r\nFor a moment her hands hovered over those two golden and gemmed volumes\r\nencasing Bradshaw and the A.B.C. Guide. To leave Oxford by an early\r\ntrain, leave him to drown unthanked, unlooked at... But this could\r\nnot be done without slighting all those hundreds of other men ... And\r\nbesides...\r\n\r\nAgain that sound on the window-pane. This time it startled her. There\r\nseemed to be no rain. Could it have been--little bits of gravel? She\r\ndarted noiselessly to the window, pushed it open, and looked down. She\r\nsaw the upturned face of the Duke. She stepped back, trembling with\r\nfury, staring around her. Inspiration came.\r\n\r\nShe thrust her head out again. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you there?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. I knew you would come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a moment, wait!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe water-jug stood where she had left it, on the floor by the\r\nwash-stand. It was almost full, rather heavy. She bore it steadily to\r\nthe window, and looked out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome a little nearer!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\r\n\r\nThe upturned and moonlit face obeyed her. She saw its lips forming the\r\nword \xe2\x80\x9cZuleika.\xe2\x80\x9d She took careful aim.\r\n\r\nFull on the face crashed the cascade of moonlit water, shooting out on\r\nall sides like the petals of some great silver anemone.\r\n\r\nShe laughed shrilly as she leapt back, letting the empty jug roll over\r\non the carpet. Then she stood tense, crouching, her hands to her mouth,\r\nher eyes askance, as much as to say \xe2\x80\x9cNow I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it!\xe2\x80\x9d She listened\r\nhard, holding her breath. In the stillness of the night was a faint\r\nsound of dripping water, and presently of footsteps going away. Then\r\nstillness unbroken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nI said that I was Clio\xe2\x80\x99s servant. And I felt, when I said it, that you\r\nlooked at me dubiously, and murmured among yourselves.\r\n\r\nNot that you doubted I was somewhat connected with Clio\xe2\x80\x99s household. The\r\nlady after whom I have named this book is alive, and well known to some\r\nof you personally, to all of you by repute. Nor had you finished my\r\nfirst page before you guessed my theme to be that episode in her life\r\nwhich caused so great a sensation among the newspaper-reading public a\r\nfew years ago. (It all seems but yesterday, does it not? They are still\r\nvivid to us, those head-lines. We have hardly yet ceased to be edified\r\nby the morals pointed in those leading articles.) And yet very soon you\r\nfound me behaving just like any novelist--reporting the exact words\r\nthat passed between the protagonists at private interviews--aye, and the\r\nexact thoughts and emotions that were in their breasts. Little wonder\r\nthat you wondered! Let me make things clear to you.\r\n\r\nI have my mistress\xe2\x80\x99 leave to do this. At first (for reasons which you\r\nwill presently understand) she demurred. But I pointed out to her that I\r\nhad been placed in a false position, and that until this were rectified\r\nneither she nor I could reap the credit due to us.\r\n\r\nKnow, then, that for a long time Clio had been thoroughly discontented.\r\nShe was happy enough, she says, when first she left the home of Pierus,\r\nher father, to become a Muse. On those humble beginnings she looks\r\nback with affection. She kept only one servant, Herodotus. The romantic\r\nelement in him appealed to her. He died, and she had about her a large\r\nstaff of able and faithful servants, whose way of doing their work\r\nirritated and depressed her. To them, apparently, life consisted of\r\nnothing but politics and military operations--things to which she, being\r\na woman, was somewhat indifferent. She was jealous of Melpomene. It\r\nseemed to her that her own servants worked from without at a mass of dry\r\ndetails which might as well be forgotten. Melpomene\xe2\x80\x99s worked on material\r\nthat was eternally interesting--the souls of men and women; and not\r\nfrom without, either; but rather casting themselves into those souls\r\nand showing to us the essence of them. She was particularly struck by a\r\nremark of Aristotle\xe2\x80\x99s, that tragedy was \xe2\x80\x9cmore philosophic\xe2\x80\x9d than history,\r\ninasmuch as it concerned itself with what might be, while history was\r\nconcerned with merely what had been. This summed up for her what she\r\nhad often felt, but could not have exactly formulated. She saw that the\r\ndepartment over which she presided was at best an inferior one. She saw\r\nthat just what she had liked--and rightly liked--in poor dear Herodotus\r\nwas just what prevented him from being a good historian. It was wrong to\r\nmix up facts and fancies. But why should her present servants deal with\r\nonly one little special set of the variegated facts of life? It was not\r\nin her power to interfere. The Nine, by the terms of the charter\r\nthat Zeus had granted to them, were bound to leave their servants an\r\nabsolutely free hand. But Clio could at least refrain from reading the\r\nworks which, by a legal fiction, she was supposed to inspire. Once or\r\ntwice in the course of a century, she would glance into this or that new\r\nhistory book, only to lay it down with a shrug of her shoulders. Some\r\nof the mediaeval chronicles she rather liked. But when, one day, Pallas\r\nasked her what she thought of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n her only answer was \xe2\x80\x9costis toia echei en edone echei en edone toia\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n (For people who like that kind of thing, that is the kind of thing they\r\nlike). This she did let slip. Generally, throughout all the centuries,\r\nshe kept up a pretence of thinking history the greatest of all the arts.\r\nShe always held her head high among her Sisters. It was only on the\r\nsly that she was an omnivorous reader of dramatic and lyric poetry.\r\nShe watched with keen interest the earliest developments of the prose\r\nromance in southern Europe; and after the publication of \xe2\x80\x9cClarissa\r\nHarlowe\xe2\x80\x9d she spent practically all her time in reading novels. It was\r\nnot until the Spring of the year 1863 that an entirely new element\r\nforced itself into her peaceful life. Zeus fell in love with her.\r\n\r\nTo us, for whom so quickly \xe2\x80\x9ctime doth transfix the flourish set on\r\nyouth,\xe2\x80\x9d there is something strange, even a trifle ludicrous, in the\r\nthought that Zeus, after all these years, is still at the beck and call\r\nof his passions. And it seems anyhow lamentable that he has not yet\r\ngained self-confidence enough to appear in his own person to the lady\r\nof his choice, and is still at pains to transform himself into whatever\r\nobject he deems likeliest to please her. To Clio, suddenly from Olympus,\r\nhe flashed down in the semblance of Kinglake\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cInvasion of the Crimea\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n (four vols., large 8vo, half-calf). She saw through his disguise\r\nimmediately, and, with great courage and independence, bade him begone.\r\nRebuffed, he was not deflected. Indeed it would seem that Clio\xe2\x80\x99s high\r\nspirit did but sharpen his desire. Hardly a day passed but he appeared\r\nin what he hoped would be the irresistible form--a recently discovered\r\nfragment of Polybius, an advance copy of the forthcoming issue of \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nHistorical Review,\xe2\x80\x9d the note-book of Professor Carl Voertschlaffen...\r\nOne day, all-prying Hermes told him of Clio\xe2\x80\x99s secret addiction to\r\nnovel-reading. Thenceforth, year in, year out, it was in the form of\r\nfiction that Zeus wooed her. The sole result was that she grew sick of\r\nthe sight of novels, and found a perverse pleasure in reading history.\r\nThese dry details of what had actually happened were a relief, she told\r\nherself, from all that make-believe.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday afternoon--the day before that very Monday on which this\r\nnarrative opens--it occurred to her how fine a thing history might be if\r\nthe historian had the novelist\xe2\x80\x99s privileges. Suppose he could be present\r\nat every scene which he was going to describe, a presence invisible and\r\ninevitable, and equipped with power to see into the breasts of all the\r\npersons whose actions he set himself to watch...\r\n\r\nWhile the Muse was thus musing, Zeus (disguised as Miss Annie S. Swan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlatest work) paid his usual visit. She let her eyes rest on him. Hither\r\nand thither she divided her swift mind, and addressed him in winged\r\nwords. \xe2\x80\x9cZeus, father of gods and men, cloud-compeller, what wouldst thou\r\nof me? But first will I say what I would of thee\xe2\x80\x9d; and she besought him\r\nto extend to the writers of history such privileges as are granted to\r\nnovelists. His whole manner had changed. He listened to her with the\r\nmassive gravity of a ruler who never yet has allowed private influence\r\nto obscure his judgment. He was silent for some time after her appeal.\r\nThen, in a voice of thunder, which made quake the slopes of Parnassus,\r\nhe gave his answer. He admitted the disabilities under which historians\r\nlaboured. But the novelists--were they not equally handicapped? They had\r\nto treat of persons who never existed, events which never were. Only\r\nby the privilege of being in the thick of those events, and in the very\r\nbowels of those persons, could they hope to hold the reader\xe2\x80\x99s attention.\r\nIf similar privileges were granted to the historian, the demand for\r\nnovels would cease forthwith, and many thousand of hard-working,\r\ndeserving men and women would be thrown out of employment. In fact, Clio\r\nhad asked him an impossible favour. But he might--he said he conceivably\r\nmight--be induced to let her have her way just once. In that event, all\r\nshe would have to do was to keep her eye on the world\xe2\x80\x99s surface, and\r\nthen, so soon as she had reason to think that somewhere was impending\r\nsomething of great import, to choose an historian. On him, straightway,\r\nZeus would confer invisibility, inevitability, and psychic penetration,\r\nwith a flawless memory thrown in.\r\n\r\nOn the following afternoon, Clio\xe2\x80\x99s roving eye saw Zuleika stepping from\r\nthe Paddington platform into the Oxford train. A few moments later I\r\nfound myself suddenly on Parnassus. In hurried words Clio told me how I\r\ncame there, and what I had to do. She said she had selected me because\r\nshe knew me to be honest, sober, and capable, and no stranger to Oxford.\r\nAnother moment, and I was at the throne of Zeus. With a majesty of\r\ngesture which I shall never forget, he stretched his hand over me, and I\r\nwas indued with the promised gifts. And then, lo! I was on the platform\r\nof Oxford station. The train was not due for another hour. But the time\r\npassed pleasantly enough.\r\n\r\nIt was fun to float all unseen, to float all unhampered by any corporeal\r\nnonsense, up and down the platform. It was fun to watch the inmost\r\nthoughts of the station-master, of the porters, of the young person at\r\nthe buffet. But of course I did not let the holiday-mood master me. I\r\nrealised the seriousness of my mission. I must concentrate myself on\r\nthe matter in hand: Miss Dobson\xe2\x80\x99s visit. What was going to happen?\r\nPrescience was no part of my outfit. From what I knew about Miss Dobson,\r\nI deduced that she would be a great success. That was all. Had I had the\r\ninstinct that was given to those Emperors in stone, and even to the\r\ndog Corker, I should have begged Clio to send in my stead some man of\r\nstronger nerve. She had charged me to be calmly vigilant, scrupulously\r\nfair. I could have been neither, had I from the outset foreseen all.\r\nOnly because the immediate future was broken to me by degrees, first as\r\na set of possibilities, then as a set of probabilities that yet might\r\nnot come off, was I able to fulfil the trust imposed in me. Even so, it\r\nwas hard. I had always accepted the doctrine that to understand all is\r\nto forgive all. Thanks to Zeus, I understood all about Miss Dobson, and\r\nyet there were moments when she repelled me--moments when I wished to\r\nsee her neither from without nor from within. So soon as the Duke of\r\nDorset met her on the Monday night, I felt I was in duty bound to keep\r\nhim under constant surveillance. Yet there were moments when I was so\r\nsorry for him that I deemed myself a brute for shadowing him.\r\n\r\nEver since I can remember, I have been beset by a recurring doubt as\r\nto whether I be or be not quite a gentleman. I have never attempted to\r\ndefine that term: I have but feverishly wondered whether in its usual\r\nacceptation (whatever that is) it be strictly applicable to myself. Many\r\npeople hold that the qualities connoted by it are primarily moral--a\r\nkind heart, honourable conduct, and so forth. On Clio\xe2\x80\x99s mission, I found\r\nhonour and kindness tugging me in precisely opposite directions. In so\r\nfar as honour tugged the harder, was I the more or the less gentlemanly?\r\nBut the test is not a fair one. Curiosity tugged on the side of honour.\r\nThis goes to prove me a cad? Oh, set against it the fact that I did\r\nat one point betray Clio\xe2\x80\x99s trust. When Miss Dobson had done the deed\r\nrecorded at the close of the foregoing chapter, I gave the Duke of\r\nDorset an hour\xe2\x80\x99s grace.\r\n\r\nI could have done no less. In the lives of most of us is some one thing\r\nthat we would not after the lapse of how many years soever confess to\r\nour most understanding friend; the thing that does not bear thinking\r\nof; the one thing to be forgotten; the unforgettable thing. Not\r\nthe commission of some great crime: this can be atoned for by great\r\npenances; and the very enormity of it has a dark grandeur. Maybe, some\r\nlittle deadly act of meanness, some hole-and-corner treachery? But\r\nwhat a man has once willed to do, his will helps him to forget. The\r\nunforgettable thing in his life is usually not a thing he has done or\r\nleft undone, but a thing done to him--some insolence or cruelty for\r\nwhich he could not, or did not, avenge himself. This it is that often\r\ncomes back to him, years after, in his dreams, and thrusts itself\r\nsuddenly into his waking thoughts, so that he clenches his hands, and\r\nshakes his head, and hums a tune loudly--anything to beat it off. In the\r\nvery hour when first befell him that odious humiliation, would you have\r\nspied on him? I gave the Duke of Dorset an hour\xe2\x80\x99s grace.\r\n\r\nWhat were his thoughts in that interval, what words, if any, he uttered\r\nto the night, never will be known. For this, Clio has abused me in\r\nlanguage less befitting a Muse than a fishwife. I do not care. I would\r\nrather be chidden by Clio than by my own sense of delicacy, any day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nNot less averse than from dogging the Duke was I from remaining another\r\ninstant in the presence of Miss Dobson. There seemed to be no possible\r\nexcuse for her. This time she had gone too far. She was outrageous. As\r\nsoon as the Duke had had time to get clear away, I floated out into the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nI may have consciously reasoned that the best way to forget the present\r\nwas in the revival of memories. Or I may have been driven by a mere\r\nhoming instinct. Anyhow, it was in the direction of my old College that\r\nI went. Midnight was tolling as I floated in through the shut grim gate\r\nat which I had so often stood knocking for admission.\r\n\r\nThe man who now occupied my room had sported his oak--my oak. I read the\r\nname on the visiting-card attached thereto--E. J. Craddock--and went in.\r\n\r\nE. J. Craddock, interloper, was sitting at my table, with elbows squared\r\nand head on one side, in the act of literary composition. The oars and\r\ncaps on my walls betokened him a rowing-man. Indeed, I recognised his\r\nsomewhat heavy face as that of the man whom, from the Judas barge this\r\nafternoon, I had seen rowing \xe2\x80\x9cstroke\xe2\x80\x9d in my College Eight.\r\n\r\nHe ought, therefore, to have been in bed and asleep two hours ago. And\r\nthe offence of his vigil was aggravated by a large tumbler that stood\r\nin front of him, containing whisky and soda. From this he took a deep\r\ndraught. Then he read over what he had written. I did not care to peer\r\nover his shoulder at MS. which, though written in my room, was not\r\nintended for my eyes. But the writer\xe2\x80\x99s brain was open to me; and he had\r\nwritten \xe2\x80\x9cI, the undersigned Edward Joseph Craddock, do hereby leave and\r\nbequeath all my personal and other property to Zuleika Dobson, spinster.\r\nThis is my last will and testament.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gnawed his pen, and presently altered the \xe2\x80\x9chereby leave\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9chereby\r\nand herewith leave.\xe2\x80\x9d Fool!\r\n\r\nI thereby and therewith left him. As I emerged through the floor of the\r\nroom above--through the very carpet that had so often been steeped in\r\nwine, and encrusted with smithereens of glass, in the brave old days\r\nof a well-remembered occupant--I found two men, both of them evidently\r\nreading-men. One of them was pacing round the room. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwas saying, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat she reminded me of, all the time? Those words--aren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthey in the Song of Solomon?--\xe2\x80\x98fair as the moon, clear as the sun,\r\nand... and...\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Terrible as an army with banners,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d supplied his host--rather testily,\r\nfor he was writing a letter. It began \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Father. By the time you\r\nreceive this I shall have taken a step which...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClearly it was vain to seek distraction in my old College. I floated out\r\ninto the untenanted meadows. Over them was the usual coverlet of white\r\nvapour, trailed from the Isis right up to Merton Wall. The scent of\r\nthese meadows\xe2\x80\x99 moisture is the scent of Oxford. Even in hottest noon,\r\none feels that the sun has not dried THEM. Always there is moisture\r\ndrifting across them, drifting into the Colleges. It, one suspects,\r\nmust have had much to do with the evocation of what is called the Oxford\r\nspirit--that gentlest spirit, so lingering and searching, so dear to\r\nthem who as youths were brought into ken of it, so exasperating to them\r\nwho were not. Yes, certainly, it is this mild, miasmal air, not less\r\nthan the grey beauty and gravity of the buildings, that has helped\r\nOxford to produce, and foster eternally, her peculiar race of\r\nartist-scholars, scholar-artists. The undergraduate, in his brief\r\nperiods of residence, is too buoyant to be mastered by the spirit of\r\nthe place. He does but salute it, and catch the manner. It is on him\r\nwho stays to spend his maturity here that the spirit will in its fulness\r\ngradually descend. The buildings and their traditions keep astir in his\r\nmind whatsoever is gracious; the climate, enfolding and enfeebling him,\r\nlulling him, keeps him careless of the sharp, harsh, exigent realities\r\nof the outer world. Careless? Not utterly. These realities may be seen\r\nby him. He may study them, be amused or touched by them. But they cannot\r\nfire him. Oxford is too damp for that. The \xe2\x80\x9cmovements\xe2\x80\x9d made there have\r\nbeen no more than protests against the mobility of others. They have\r\nbeen without the dynamic quality implied in their name. They have been\r\nno more than the sighs of men gazing at what other men had left behind\r\nthem; faint, impossible appeals to the god of retrogression, uttered for\r\ntheir own sake and ritual, rather than with any intent that they should\r\nbe heard. Oxford, that lotus-land, saps the will-power, the power\r\nof action. But, in doing so, it clarifies the mind, makes larger the\r\nvision, gives, above all, that playful and caressing suavity of manner\r\nwhich comes of a conviction that nothing matters, except ideas, and that\r\nnot even ideas are worth dying for, inasmuch as the ghosts of them slain\r\nseem worthy of yet more piously elaborate homage than can be given to\r\nthem in their heyday. If the Colleges could be transferred to the dry\r\nand bracing top of some hill, doubtless they would be more evidently\r\nuseful to the nation. But let us be glad there is no engineer or\r\nenchanter to compass that task. Egomet, I would liefer have the rest of\r\nEngland subside into the sea than have Oxford set on a salubrious level.\r\nFor there is nothing in England to be matched with what lurks in the\r\nvapours of these meadows, and in the shadows of these spires--that\r\nmysterious, inenubilable spirit, spirit of Oxford. Oxford! The very\r\nsight of the word printed, or sound of it spoken, is fraught for me with\r\nmost actual magic.\r\n\r\nAnd on that moonlit night when I floated among the vapours of these\r\nmeadows, myself less than a vapour, I knew and loved Oxford as never\r\nbefore, as never since. Yonder, in the Colleges, was the fume and fret\r\nof tragedy--Love as Death\xe2\x80\x99s decoy, and Youth following her. What then?\r\nNot Oxford was menaced. Come what might, not a stone of Oxford\xe2\x80\x99s walls\r\nwould be loosened, nor a wreath of her vapours be undone, nor lost a\r\nbreath of her sacred spirit.\r\n\r\nI floated up into the higher, drier air, that I might, for once, see the\r\ntotal body of that spirit.\r\n\r\nThere lay Oxford far beneath me, like a map in grey and black and\r\nsilver. All that I had known only as great single things I saw now\r\noutspread in apposition, and tiny; tiny symbols, as it were, of\r\nthemselves, greatly symbolising their oneness. There they lay, these\r\nmultitudinous and disparate quadrangles, all their rivalries merged in\r\nthe making of a great catholic pattern. And the roofs of the buildings\r\naround them seemed level with their lawns. No higher the roofs of the\r\nvery towers. Up from their tiny segment of the earth\xe2\x80\x99s spinning surface\r\nthey stood negligible beneath infinity. And new, too, quite new, in\r\neternity; transient upstarts. I saw Oxford as a place that had no more\r\npast and no more future than a mining-camp. I smiled down. O hoary and\r\nunassailable mushroom!... But if a man carry his sense of proportion far\r\nenough, lo! he is back at the point from which he started. He knows\r\nthat eternity, as conceived by him, is but an instant in eternity, and\r\ninfinity but a speck in infinity. How should they belittle the things\r\nnear to him?... Oxford was venerable and magical, after all, and\r\nenduring. Aye, and not because she would endure was it the less\r\nlamentable that the young lives within her walls were like to be taken.\r\nMy equanimity was gone; and a tear fell on Oxford.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as though Oxford herself were speaking up to me, the air\r\nvibrated with a sweet noise of music. It was the hour of one; the end\r\nof the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s hour of grace. Through the silvery tangle of sounds from\r\nother clocks I floated quickly down to the Broad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nI had on the way a horrible apprehension. What if the Duke, in his\r\nagony, had taken the one means to forgetfulness? His room, I could see,\r\nwas lit up; but a man does not necessarily choose to die in the dark. I\r\nhovered, afraid, over the dome of the Sheldonian. I saw that the window\r\nof the room above the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s was also lit up. And there was no reason\r\nat all to doubt the survival of Noaks. Perhaps the sight of him would\r\nhearten me.\r\n\r\nI was wrong. The sight of Noaks in his room was as dismal a thing as\r\ncould be. With his chin sunk on his breast, he sat there, on a rickety\r\nchair, staring up at the mantel-piece. This he had decked out as a sort\r\nof shrine. In the centre, aloft on an inverted tin that had contained\r\nAbernethy biscuits, stood a blue plush frame, with an inner rim of\r\nbrass, several sizes too big for the picture-postcard installed in it.\r\nZuleika\xe2\x80\x99s image gazed forth with a smile that was obviously not intended\r\nfor the humble worshipper at this execrable shrine. On either side\r\nof her stood a small vase, one holding some geraniums, the other some\r\nmignonette. And just beneath her was placed that iron ring which,\r\nrightly or wrongly, Noaks supposed to alleviate rheumatism--that same\r\niron ring which, by her touch to-night, had been charged for him with a\r\nyet deeper magic, insomuch that he dared no longer wear it, and had set\r\nit before her as an oblation.\r\n\r\nYet, for all his humility, he was possessed by a spirit of egoism that\r\nrepelled me. While he sat peering over his spectacles at the beauteous\r\nimage, he said again and again to himself, in a hollow voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI am so\r\nyoung to die.\xe2\x80\x9d Every time he said this, two large, pear-shaped\r\ntears emerged from behind his spectacles, and found their way to\r\nhis waistcoat. It did not seem to strike him that quite half of\r\nthe undergraduates who contemplated death--and contemplated it in a\r\nfearless, wholesome, manly fashion--were his juniors. It seemed to seem\r\nto him that his own death, even though all those other far brighter\r\nand more promising lives than his were to be sacrificed, was a thing to\r\nbother about. Well, if he did not want to die, why could he not have,\r\nat least, the courage of his cowardice? The world would not cease to\r\nrevolve because Noaks still clung to its surface. For me the whole\r\ntragedy was cheapened by his participation in it. I was fain to\r\nleave him. His squint, his short legs dangling towards the floor, his\r\ntear-sodden waistcoat, and his refrain \xe2\x80\x9cI am so young to die,\xe2\x80\x9d were\r\nbeyond measure exasperating. Yet I hesitated to pass into the room\r\nbeneath, for fear of what I might see there.\r\n\r\nHow long I might have paltered, had no sound come from that room, I\r\nknow not. But a sound came, sharp and sudden in the night, instantly\r\nreassuring. I swept down into the presence of the Duke.\r\n\r\nHe stood with his head flung back and his arms folded, gorgeous in a\r\ndressing-gown of crimson brocade. In animation of pride and pomp,\r\nhe looked less like a mortal man than like a figure from some great\r\nbiblical group by Paul Veronese.\r\n\r\nAnd this was he whom I had presumed to pity! And this was he whom I had\r\nhalf expected to find dead.\r\n\r\nHis face, usually pale, was now red; and his hair, which no eye had ever\r\nyet seen disordered, stood up in a glistening shock. These two changes\r\nin him intensified the effect of vitality. One of them, however,\r\nvanished as I watched it. The Duke\xe2\x80\x99s face resumed its pallor. I realised\r\nthen that he had but blushed; and I realised, simultaneously, that what\r\nhad called that blush to his cheek was what had also been the signal to\r\nme that he was alive. His blush had been a pendant to his sneeze. And\r\nhis sneeze had been a pendant to that outrage which he had been striving\r\nto forget. He had caught cold.\r\n\r\nHe had caught cold. In the hour of his soul\xe2\x80\x99s bitter need, his body had\r\nbeen suborned against him. Base! Had he not stripped his body of its\r\nwet vesture? Had he not vigorously dried his hair, and robed himself in\r\ncrimson, and struck in solitude such attitudes as were most congruous\r\nwith his high spirit and high rank? He had set himself to crush\r\nremembrance of that by which through his body his soul had been\r\nassailed. And well had he known that in this conflict a giant demon was\r\nhis antagonist. But that his own body would play traitor--no, this he\r\nhad not foreseen. This was too base a thing to be foreseen.\r\n\r\nHe stood quite still, a figure orgulous and splendent. And it seemed as\r\nthough the hot night, too, stood still, to watch him, in awe, through\r\nthe open lattices of his window, breathlessly. But to me, equipped\r\nto see beneath the surface, he was piteous, piteous in ratio to the\r\npretension of his aspect. Had he crouched down and sobbed, I should have\r\nbeen as much relieved as he. But he stood seignorial and aquiline.\r\n\r\nPainless, by comparison with this conflict in him, seemed the conflict\r\nthat had raged in him yesternight. Then, it had been his dandihood\r\nagainst his passion for Zuleika. What mattered the issue? Whichever\r\nwon, the victory were sweet. And of this he had all the while been\r\nsubconscious, gallantly though he fought for his pride of dandihood.\r\nTo-night in the battle between pride and memory, he knew from the outset\r\nthat pride\xe2\x80\x99s was but a forlorn hope, and that memory would be barbarous\r\nin her triumph. Not winning to oblivion, he must hate with a fathomless\r\nhatred. Of all the emotions, hatred is the most excruciating. Of all\r\nthe objects of hatred, a woman once loved is the most hateful. Of all\r\ndeaths, the bitterest that can befall a man is that he lay down his life\r\nto flatter the woman he deems vilest of her sex.\r\n\r\nSuch was the death that the Duke of Dorset saw confronting him. Most\r\nmen, when they are at war with the past, have the future as ally.\r\nLooking steadfastly forward, they can forget. The Duke\xe2\x80\x99s future was\r\nopenly in league with his past. For him, prospect was memory. All\r\nthat there was for him of future was the death to which his honour was\r\npledged. To envisage that was to... no, he would NOT envisage it! With a\r\npassionate effort he hypnotised himself to think of nothing at all. His\r\nbrain, into which, by the power Zeus gave me, I was gazing, became a\r\nperfect vacuum, insulated by the will. It was the kind of experiment\r\nwhich scientists call \xe2\x80\x9cbeautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d And yes, beautiful it was.\r\n\r\nBut not in the eyes of Nature. She abhors a vacuum. Seeing the enormous\r\nodds against which the Duke was fighting, she might well have stood\r\naside. But she has no sense of sport whatsoever. She stepped in.\r\n\r\nAt first I did not realise what was happening. I saw the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\r\ncontract, and the muscles of his mouth drawn down, and, at the same\r\ntime, a tense upward movement of his whole body. Then, suddenly, the\r\nstrain undone: a downward dart of the head, a loud percussion. Thrice\r\nthe Duke sneezed, with a sound that was as the bursting of the dams of\r\nbody and soul together; then sneezed again.\r\n\r\nNow was his will broken. He capitulated. In rushed shame and horror and\r\nhatred, pell-mell, to ravage him.\r\n\r\nWhat care now, what use, for deportment? He walked coweringly round and\r\nround his room, with frantic gestures, with head bowed. He shuffled and\r\nslunk. His dressing-gown had the look of a gabardine.\r\n\r\nShame and horror and hatred went slashing and hewing throughout the\r\nfallen citadel. At length, exhausted, he flung himself down on the\r\nwindow-seat and leaned out into the night, panting. The air was full of\r\nthunder. He clutched at his throat. From the depths of the black caverns\r\nbeneath their brows the eyes of the unsleeping Emperors watched him.\r\n\r\nHe had gone through much in the day that was past. He had loved and\r\nlost. He had striven to recapture, and had failed. In a strange resolve\r\nhe had found serenity and joy. He had been at the point of death, and\r\nhad been saved. He had seen that his beloved was worthless, and he had\r\nnot cared. He had fought for her, and conquered; and had pled with her,\r\nand--all these memories were loathsome by reason of that final thing\r\nwhich had all the while lain in wait for him.\r\n\r\nHe looked back and saw himself as he had been at a score of crucial\r\nmoments in the day--always in the shadow of that final thing. He saw\r\nhimself as he had been on the playing-fields of Eton; aye! and in the\r\narms of his nurse, to and fro on the terrace of Tankerton--always in the\r\nshadow of that final thing, always piteous and ludicrous, doomed. Thank\r\nheaven the future was unknowable? It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, now. To-morrow--to-day--he\r\nmust die for that accursed fiend of a woman--the woman with the hyena\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\nWhat to do meanwhile? Impossible to sleep. He felt in his body the\r\nstrain of his quick sequence of spiritual adventures. He was dog-tired.\r\nBut his brain was furiously out of hand: no stopping it. And the night\r\nwas stifling. And all the while, in the dead silence, as though his soul\r\nhad ears, there was a sound. It was a very faint, unearthly sound, and\r\nseemed to come from nowhere, yet to have a meaning. He feared he was\r\nrather over-wrought.\r\n\r\nHe must express himself. That would soothe him. Ever since childhood\r\nhe had had, from time to time, the impulse to set down in writing\r\nhis thoughts or his moods. In such exercises he had found for his\r\nself-consciousness the vent which natures less reserved than his find in\r\ncasual talk with Tom, Dick and Harry, with Jane, Susan, and Liz. Aloof\r\nfrom either of these triads, he had in his first term at Eton taken to\r\nhimself as confidant, and retained ever since, a great quarto volume,\r\nbound in red morocco and stamped with his coronet and cypher. It was\r\nherein, year by year, that his soul spread itself.\r\n\r\nHe wrote mostly in English prose; but other modes were not infrequent.\r\nWhenever he was abroad, it was his courteous habit to write in the\r\nlanguage of the country where he was residing--French, when he was in\r\nhis house on the Champs Elysees; Italian, when he was in his villa at\r\nBaiae; and so on. When he was in his own country he felt himself free to\r\ndeviate sometimes from the vernacular into whatever language were aptest\r\nto his frame of mind. In his sterner moods he gravitated to Latin,\r\nand wrought the noble iron of that language to effects that were, if\r\nanything, a trifle over-impressive. He found for his highest flights of\r\ncontemplation a handy vehicle in Sanscrit. In hours of mere joy it was\r\nGreek poetry that flowed likeliest from his pen; and he had a special\r\nfondness for the metre of Alcaeus.\r\n\r\nAnd now, too, in his darkest hour, it was Greek that surged in\r\nhim--iambics of thunderous wrath such as those which are volleyed by\r\nPrometheus. But as he sat down to his writing-table, and unlocked the\r\ndear old album, and dipped his pen in the ink, a great calm fell on him.\r\nThe iambics in him began to breathe such sweetness as is on the lips of\r\nAlcestis going to her doom. But, just as he set pen to paper, his hand\r\nfaltered, and he sprang up, victim of another and yet more violent fit\r\nof sneezing.\r\n\r\nDisbuskined, dangerous. The spirit of Juvenal woke in him. He would\r\nflay. He would make Woman (as he called Zuleika) writhe. Latin\r\nhexameters, of course. An epistle to his heir presumptive... \xe2\x80\x9cVae tibi,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he began,\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cVae tibi, vae misero, nisi circumspexeris artes\r\n     Femineas, nam nulla salus quin femina possit\r\n     Tradere, nulla fides quin\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuin,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. In writing soliloquies, his trouble was to\r\ncurb inspiration. The thought that he was addressing his\r\nheir-presumptive--now heir-only-too-apparent--gave him pause. Nor, he\r\nreflected, was he addressing this brute only, but a huge posthumous\r\naudience. These hexameters would be sure to appear in the \xe2\x80\x9cauthorised\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n biography. \xe2\x80\x9cA melancholy interest attaches to the following lines,\r\nwritten, it would seem, on the very eve of\xe2\x80\x9d... He winced. Was it really\r\npossible, and no dream, that he was to die to-morrow--to-day?\r\n\r\nEven you, unassuming reader, go about with a vague notion that in your\r\ncase, somehow, the ultimate demand of nature will be waived. The\r\nDuke, until he conceived his sudden desire to die, had deemed himself\r\ncertainly exempt. And now, as he sat staring at his window, he saw in\r\nthe paling of the night the presage of the dawn of his own last day.\r\nSometimes (orphaned though he was in early childhood) he had even found\r\nit hard to believe there was no exemption for those to whom he stood in\r\nany personal relation. He remembered how, soon after he went to Eton,\r\nhe had received almost with incredulity the news of the death of his\r\ngod-father, Lord Stackley, an octogenarian.... He took from the table\r\nhis album, knowing that on one of the earliest pages was inscribed his\r\nboyish sense of that bereavement. Yes, here the passage was, written in\r\na large round hand:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeath knocks, as we know, at the door of the cottage and of the castle.\r\nHe stalks up the front-garden and the steep steps of the semi-detached\r\nvilla, and plies the ornamental knocker so imperiously that the panels\r\nof imitation stained glass quiver in the thin front-door. Even the\r\nfamily that occupies the topmost story of a building without a lift is\r\non his ghastly visiting-list. He rattles his fleshless knuckles against\r\nthe door of the gypsy\xe2\x80\x99s caravan. Into the savage\xe2\x80\x99s tent, wigwam, or\r\nwattled hut, he darts unbidden. Even on the hermit in the cave he forces\r\nhis obnoxious presence. His is an universal beat, and he walks it with\r\na grin. But be sure it is at the sombre portal of the nobleman that he\r\nknocks with the greatest gusto. It is there, where haply his visit will\r\nbe commemorated with a hatchment; it is then, when the muffled thunder\r\nof the Dead March in \xe2\x80\x98Saul\xe2\x80\x99 will soon be rolling in cathedrals; it\r\nis then, it is there, that the pride of his unquestioned power comes\r\ngrimliest home to him. Is there no withstanding him? Why should he be\r\nadmitted always with awe, a cravenly-honoured guest? When next he calls,\r\nlet the butler send him about his business, or tell him to step round to\r\nthe servants\xe2\x80\x99 entrance. If it be made plain to him that his visits are\r\nan impertinence, he will soon be disemboldened. Once the aristocracy\r\nmake a stand against him, there need be no more trouble about the\r\nexorbitant Duties named after him. And for the hereditary system--that\r\nsystem which both offends the common sense of the Radical, and wounds\r\nthe Tory by its implied admission that noblemen are mortal--a seemly\r\nsubstitute will have been found.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArtless and crude in expression, very boyish, it seemed now to its\r\nauthor. Yet, in its simple wistfulness, it had quality: it rang true.\r\nThe Duke wondered whether, with all that he had since mastered in the\r\ngreat art of English prose, he had not lost something, too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there no withstanding him?\xe2\x80\x9d To think that the boy who uttered that\r\ncry, and gave back so brave an answer, was within nine years to go\r\nseek death of his own accord! How the gods must be laughing! Yes,\r\nthe exquisite point of the joke, for them, was that he CHOSE to die.\r\nBut--and, as the thought flashed through him, he started like a man\r\nshot--what if he chose not to? Stay, surely there was some reason why\r\nhe MUST die. Else, why throughout the night had he taken his doom for\r\ngranted?... Honour: yes, he had pledged himself. Better death than\r\ndishonour. Was it, though? was it? Ah, he, who had come so near to\r\ndeath, saw dishonour as a tiny trifle. Where was the sting of it? Not\r\nhe would be ridiculous to-morrow--to-day. Every one would acclaim his\r\nsplendid act of moral courage. She, she, the hyena woman, would be the\r\nfool. No one would have thought of dying for her, had he not set the\r\nexample. Every one would follow his new example. Yes, he would\r\nsave Oxford yet. That was his duty. Duty and darling vengeance! And\r\nlife--life!\r\n\r\nIt was full dawn now. Gone was that faint, monotonous sound which had\r\npunctuated in his soul the horrors of his vigil. But, in reminder of\r\nthose hours, his lamp was still burning. He extinguished it; and the\r\ngoing-out of that tarnished light made perfect his sense of release.\r\n\r\nHe threw wide his arms in welcome of the great adorable day, and of all\r\nthe great adorable days that were to be his.\r\n\r\nHe leaned out from his window, drinking the dawn in. The gods had\r\nmade merry over him, had they? And the cry of the hyena had made night\r\nhideous. Well, it was his turn now. He would laugh last and loudest.\r\n\r\nAnd already, for what was to be, he laughed outright into the morning;\r\ninsomuch that the birds in the trees of Trinity, and still more the\r\nEmperors over the way, marvelled greatly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nThey had awaited thousands and innumerable thousands of daybreaks in the\r\nBroad, these Emperors, counting the long slow hours till the night were\r\nover. It is in the night especially that their fallen greatness haunts\r\nthem. Day brings some distraction. They are not incurious of the lives\r\naround them--these little lives that succeed one another so quickly. To\r\nthem, in their immemorial old age, youth is a constant wonder. And so\r\nis death, which to them comes not. Youth or death--which, they had often\r\nasked themselves, was the goodlier? But it was ill that these two things\r\nshould be mated. It was ill-come, this day of days.\r\n\r\nLong after the Duke was in bed and asleep, his peal of laughter echoed\r\nin the ears of the Emperors. Why had he laughed?\r\n\r\nAnd they said to themselves \xe2\x80\x9cWe are very old men, and broken, and in a\r\nland not our own. There are things that we do not understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrief was the freshness of the dawn. From all points of the compass,\r\ndark grey clouds mounted into the sky. There, taking their places\r\nas though in accordance to a strategic plan laid down for them, they\r\nponderously massed themselves, and presently, as at a given signal,\r\ndrew nearer to earth, and halted, an irresistible great army, awaiting\r\norders.\r\n\r\nSomewhere under cover of them the sun went his way, transmitting a\r\nsulphurous heat. The very birds in the trees of Trinity were oppressed\r\nand did not twitter. The very leaves did not whisper.\r\n\r\nOut through the railings, and across the road, prowled a skimpy and\r\ndingy cat, trying to look like a tiger.\r\n\r\nIt was all very sinister and dismal.\r\n\r\nThe hours passed. The Broad put forth, one by one, its signs of waking.\r\n\r\nSoon after eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, as usual, the front-door of the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlodgings was opened from within. The Emperors watched for the faint\r\ncloud of dust that presently emerged, and for her whom it preceded. To\r\nthem, this first outcoming of the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s daughter was a moment of\r\ndaily interest. Katie!--they had known her as a toddling child; and\r\nlater as a little girl scampering off to school, all legs and pinafore\r\nand streaming golden hair. And now she was sixteen years old. Her hair,\r\ntied back at the nape of her neck, would very soon be \xe2\x80\x9cup.\xe2\x80\x9d Her big\r\nblue eyes were as they had always been; but she had long passed out of\r\npinafores into aprons, had taken on a sedateness befitting her years and\r\nher duties, and was anxious to be regarded rather as an aunt than as\r\na sister by her brother Clarence, aged twelve. The Emperors had always\r\npredicted that she would be pretty. And very pretty she was.\r\n\r\nAs she came slowly out, with eyes downcast to her broom, sweeping the\r\ndust so seriously over the doorstep and then across the pavement, and\r\nanon when she reappeared with pail and scrubbing-brush, and abased\r\nherself before the doorstep, and wrought so vehemently there, what\r\nfilled her little soul was not the dignity of manual labour. The duties\r\nthat Zuleika had envied her were dear to her exactly as they would have\r\nbeen, yesterday morning, to Zuleika. The Emperors had often noticed that\r\nduring vacations their little favourite\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of the doorstep was\r\nlanguid and perfunctory. They knew well her secret, and always (for who\r\ncan be long in England without becoming sentimental?) they cherished the\r\nhope of a romantic union between her and \xe2\x80\x9ca certain young gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\nthey archly called the Duke. His continued indifference to her they took\r\nalmost as an affront to themselves. Where in all England was a prettier,\r\nsweeter girl than their Katie? The sudden irruption of Zuleika into\r\nOxford was especially grievous to them because they could no longer\r\nhope against hope that Katie would be led by the Duke to the altar, and\r\nthence into the highest social circles, and live happily ever after.\r\nLuckily it was for Katie, however, that they had no power to fill her\r\nhead with their foolish notions. It was well for her to have never\r\ndoubted she loved in vain. She had soon grown used to her lot. Not until\r\nyesterday had there been any bitterness. Jealousy surged in Katie at the\r\nvery moment when she beheld Zuleika on the threshold. A glance at the\r\nDuke\xe2\x80\x99s face when she showed the visitor up was enough to acquaint\r\nher with the state of his heart. And she did not, for confirming her\r\nintuition, need the two or three opportunities she took of listening at\r\nthe keyhole. What in the course of those informal audiences did surprise\r\nher--so much indeed that she could hardly believe her ear--was that it\r\nwas possible for a woman not to love the Duke. Her jealousy of \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nMiss Dobson\xe2\x80\x9d was for a while swallowed up in her pity for him. What she\r\nhad borne so cheerfully for herself she could not bear for her hero. She\r\nwished she had not happened to listen.\r\n\r\nAnd this morning, while she knelt swaying and spreading over \xe2\x80\x9chis\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n doorstep, her blue eyes added certain tears to be scrubbed away in the\r\ngeneral moisture of the stone. Rising, she dried her hands in her apron,\r\nand dried her eyes with her hands. Lest her mother should see that she\r\nhad been crying, she loitered outside the door. Suddenly, her roving\r\nglance changed to a stare of acute hostility. She knew well that the\r\nperson wandering towards her was--no, not \xe2\x80\x9cthat Miss Dobson,\xe2\x80\x9d as she had\r\nfor the fraction of an instant supposed, but the next worst thing.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Melisande indoors was an evidently French maid.\r\nOut of doors she was not less evidently Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s. Not that she aped her\r\nmistress. The resemblance had come by force of propinquity and devotion.\r\nNature had laid no basis for it. Not one point of form or colour had\r\nthe two women in common. It has been said that Zuleika was not strictly\r\nbeautiful. Melisande, like most Frenchwomen, was strictly plain. But\r\nin expression and port, in her whole tournure, she had become, as\r\nevery good maid does, her mistress\xe2\x80\x99 replica. The poise of her head, the\r\nboldness of her regard and brilliance of her smile, the leisurely and\r\nswinging way in which she walked, with a hand on the hip--all these\r\nthings of hers were Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s too. She was no conqueror. None but the\r\nman to whom she was betrothed--a waiter at the Cafe Tourtel, named\r\nPelleas--had ever paid court to her; nor was she covetous of other\r\nhearts. Yet she looked victorious, and insatiable of victories, and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cterrible as an army with banners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the hand that was not on her hip she carried a letter. And on her\r\nshoulders she had to bear the full burden of the hatred that Zuleika had\r\ninspired in Katie. But this she did not know. She came glancing boldly,\r\nleisurely, at the numbers on the front-doors.\r\n\r\nKatie stepped back on to the doorstep, lest the inferiority of her\r\nstature should mar the effect of her disdain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-day. Is it here that Duke D\xe2\x80\x99Orsay lives?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Melisande, as\r\nnearly accurate as a Gaul may be in such matters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Duke of Dorset,\xe2\x80\x9d said Katie with a cold and insular emphasis,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clives here.\xe2\x80\x9d And \xe2\x80\x9cYou,\xe2\x80\x9d she tried to convey with her eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cyou, for\r\nall your smart black silk, are a hireling. I am Miss Batch. I happen to\r\nhave a hobby for housework. I have not been crying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen please mount this to him at once,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melisande, holding out the\r\nletter. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is from Miss Dobson\xe2\x80\x99s part. Very express. I wait response.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very ugly,\xe2\x80\x9d Katie signalled with her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very pretty.\r\nI have the Oxfordshire complexion. And I play the piano.\xe2\x80\x9d With her lips\r\nshe said merely, \xe2\x80\x9cHis Grace is not called before nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut to-day you go wake him now--quick--is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite out of the question,\xe2\x80\x9d said Katie. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you care to leave\r\nthat letter here, I will see that it is placed on his Grace\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbreakfast-table, with the morning\xe2\x80\x99s post.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cFor the rest,\xe2\x80\x9d added her\r\neyes, \xe2\x80\x9cDown with France!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI find you droll, but droll, my little one!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Melisande.\r\n\r\nKatie stepped back and shut the door in her face. \xe2\x80\x9cLike a little\r\nEmpress,\xe2\x80\x9d the Emperors commented.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchwoman threw up her hands and apostrophised heaven. To this day\r\nshe believes that all the bonnes of Oxford are mad, but mad, and of a\r\nmadness.\r\n\r\nShe stared at the door, at the pail and scrubbing-brush that had been\r\nshut out with her, at the letter in her hand. She decided that she had\r\nbetter drop the letter into the slit in the door and make report to Miss\r\nDobson.\r\n\r\nAs the envelope fell through the slit to the door-mat, Katie made at\r\nMelisande a grimace which, had not the panels been opaque, would have\r\nastonished the Emperors. Resuming her dignity, she picked the thing up,\r\nand, at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length, examined it. It was inscribed in pencil. Katie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlips curled at sight of the large, audacious handwriting. But it is\r\nprobable that whatever kind of handwriting Zuleika might have had would\r\nhave been just the kind that Katie would have expected.\r\n\r\nFingering the envelope, she wondered what the wretched woman had to\r\nsay. It occurred to her that the kettle was simmering on the hob in the\r\nkitchen, and that she might easily steam open the envelope and master\r\nits contents. However, her doing this would have in no way affected\r\nthe course of the tragedy. And so the gods (being to-day in a strictly\r\nartistic mood) prompted her to mind her own business.\r\n\r\nLaying the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s table for breakfast, she made as usual a neat\r\nrectangular pile of the letters that had come for him by post. Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter she threw down askew. That luxury she allowed herself.\r\n\r\nAnd he, when he saw the letter, allowed himself the luxury of leaving it\r\nunopened awhile. Whatever its purport, he knew it could but minister to\r\nhis happy malice. A few hours ago, with what shame and dread it would\r\nhave stricken him! Now it was a dainty to be dallied with.\r\n\r\nHis eyes rested on the black tin boxes that contained his robes of the\r\nGarter. Hateful had been the sight of them in the watches of the night,\r\nwhen he thought he had worn those robes for the last time. But now--!\r\n\r\nHe opened Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s letter. It did not disappoint him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR DUKE,--DO, DO forgive me. I am beyond words ashamed of the silly\r\ntomboyish thing I did last night. Of course it was no worse than that,\r\nbut an awful fear haunts me that you MAY have thought I acted in anger\r\nat the idea of your breaking your promise to me. Well, it is quite true\r\nI had been hurt and angry when you hinted at doing that, but the moment\r\nI left you I saw that you had been only in fun, and I enjoyed the joke\r\nagainst myself, though I thought it was rather too bad of you. And\r\nthen, as a sort of revenge, but almost before I knew what I was doing,\r\nI played that IDIOTIC practical joke on you. I have been MISERABLE ever\r\nsince. DO come round as early as possible and tell me I am forgiven. But\r\nbefore you tell me that, please lecture me till I cry--though indeed I\r\nhave been crying half through the night. And then if you want to be VERY\r\nhorrid you may tease me for being so slow to see a joke. And then you\r\nmight take me to see some of the Colleges and things before we go on to\r\nlunch at The MacQuern\xe2\x80\x99s? Forgive pencil and scrawl. Am sitting up in bed\r\nto write.--Your sincere friend,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cZ. D.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP.S.--Please burn this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAt that final injunction, the Duke abandoned himself to his mirth.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease burn this.\xe2\x80\x9d Poor dear young woman, how modest she was in the\r\nglare of her diplomacy! Why there was nothing, not one phrase, to\r\ncompromise her in the eyes of a coroner\xe2\x80\x99s jury!... Seriously, she\r\nhad good reason to be proud of her letter. For the purpose in view it\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been better done. That was what made it so touchingly\r\nabsurd. He put himself in her position. He pictured himself as her,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csitting up in bed,\xe2\x80\x9d pencil in hand, to explain away, to soothe, to\r\nclinch and bind... Yes, if he had happened to be some other man--one\r\nwhom her insult might have angered without giving love its death-blow,\r\nand one who could be frightened out of not keeping his word--this letter\r\nwould have been capital.\r\n\r\nHe helped himself to some more marmalade, and poured out another cup of\r\ncoffee. Nothing is more thrilling, thought he, than to be treated as a\r\ncully by the person you hold in the hollow of your hand.\r\n\r\nBut within this great irony lay (to be glided over) another irony. He\r\nknew well in what mood Zuleika had done what she had done to him last\r\nnight; yet he preferred to accept her explanation of it.\r\n\r\nOfficially, then, he acquitted her of anything worse than tomboyishness.\r\nBut this verdict for his own convenience implied no mercy to the\r\nculprit. The sole point for him was how to administer her punishment the\r\nmost poignantly. Just how should he word his letter?\r\n\r\nHe rose from his chair, and \xe2\x80\x9cDear Miss Dobson--no, MY dear Miss Dobson,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he murmured, pacing the room, \xe2\x80\x9cI am so very sorry I cannot come to see\r\nyou: I have to attend two lectures this morning. By contrast with this\r\nweariness, it will be the more delightful to meet you at The MacQuern\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nI want to see as much as I can of you to-day, because to-night there is\r\nthe Bump Supper, and to-morrow morning, alas! I must motor to Windsor\r\nfor this wretched Investiture. Meanwhile, how can you ask to be forgiven\r\nwhen there is nothing whatever to forgive? It seems to me that mine, not\r\nyours, is the form of humour that needs explanation. My proposal to die\r\nfor you was made in as playful a spirit as my proposal to marry you. And\r\nit is really for me to ask forgiveness of you. One thing especially,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nmurmured, fingering in his waistcoat-pocket the ear-rings she had given\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cpricks my conscience. I do feel that I ought not to have let\r\nyou give me these two pearls--at any rate, not the one which went into\r\npremature mourning for me. As I have no means of deciding which of the\r\ntwo this one is, I enclose them both, with the hope that the pretty\r\ndifference between them will in time reappear\xe2\x80\x9d... Or words to that\r\neffect... Stay! why not add to the joy of contriving that effect the\r\ngreater joy of watching it? Why send Zuleika a letter? He would obey her\r\nsummons. He would speed to her side. He snatched up a hat.\r\n\r\nIn this haste, however, he detected a certain lack of dignity. He\r\nsteadied himself, and went slowly to the mirror. There he adjusted his\r\nhat with care, and regarded himself very seriously, very sternly, from\r\nvarious angles, like a man invited to paint his own portrait for the\r\nUffizi. He must be worthy of himself. It was well that Zuleika should\r\nbe chastened. Great was her sin. Out of life and death she had fashioned\r\ntoys for her vanity. But his joy must be in vindication of what was\r\nnoble, not in making suffer what was vile. Yesterday he had been her\r\npuppet, her Jumping-Jack; to-day it was as avenging angel that he would\r\nappear before her. The gods had mocked him who was now their minister.\r\nTheir minister? Their master, as being once more master of himself. It\r\nwas they who had plotted his undoing. Because they loved him they were\r\nfain that he should die young. The Dobson woman was but their agent,\r\ntheir cat\xe2\x80\x99s-paw. By her they had all but got him. Not quite! And now, to\r\nteach them, through her, a lesson they would not soon forget, he would\r\ngo forth.\r\n\r\nShaking with laughter, the gods leaned over the thunder-clouds to watch\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe went forth.\r\n\r\nOn the well-whitened doorstep he was confronted by a small boy in\r\nuniform bearing a telegram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuke of Dorset?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the small boy.\r\n\r\nOpening the envelope, the Duke saw that the message, with which was a\r\nprepaid form for reply, had been handed in at the Tankerton post-office.\r\nIt ran thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Deeply regret inform your grace last night\r\n     two black owls came and perched on battlements\r\n     remained there through night hooting\r\n     at dawn flew away none knows whither\r\n     awaiting instructions            Jellings\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duke\xe2\x80\x99s face, though it grew white, moved not one muscle.\r\n\r\nSomewhat shamed now, the gods ceased from laughing.\r\n\r\nThe Duke looked from the telegram to the boy. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you a pencil?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, producing a stump of pencil.\r\n\r\nHolding the prepaid form against the door, the Duke wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Jellings Tankerton Hall\r\n     Prepare vault for funeral Monday\r\n\r\n                              Dorset\r\n\r\n\r\nHis handwriting was as firmly and minutely beautiful as ever. Only in\r\nthat he forgot there was nothing to pay did he belie his calm. \xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said to the boy, \xe2\x80\x9cis a shilling; and you may keep the change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, and went his way, as happy as a\r\npostman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nHumphrey Greddon, in the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s place, would have taken a pinch of\r\nsnuff. But he could not have made that gesture with a finer air than the\r\nDuke gave to its modern equivalent. In the art of taking and lighting\r\na cigarette, there was one man who had no rival in Europe. This time he\r\noutdid even himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d you say, \xe2\x80\x9cbut \xe2\x80\x98pluck\xe2\x80\x99 is one thing, endurance another. A man who\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t reel on receipt of his death-warrant may yet break down when he\r\nhas had time to think it over. How did the Duke acquit himself when he\r\ncame to the end of his cigarette? And by the way, how was it that after\r\nhe had read the telegram you didn\xe2\x80\x99t give him again an hour\xe2\x80\x99s grace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a way, you have a perfect right to ask both those questions. But\r\ntheir very pertinence shows that you think I might omit things that\r\nmatter. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt me again. Am _I_ writing this history, or\r\nare you?\r\n\r\nThough the news that he must die was a yet sharper douche, as you have\r\nsuggested, than the douche inflicted by Zuleika, it did at least leave\r\nunscathed the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s pride. The gods can make a man ridiculous through\r\na woman, but they cannot make him ridiculous when they deal him a blow\r\ndirect. The very greatness of their power makes them, in that respect,\r\nimpotent. They had decreed that the Duke should die, and they had told\r\nhim so. There was nothing to demean him in that. True, he had just\r\nmeasured himself against them. But there was no shame in being\r\ngravelled. The peripety was according to the best rules of tragic art.\r\nThe whole thing was in the grand manner.\r\n\r\nThus I felt that there were no indelicacy, this time, in watching\r\nhim. Just as \xe2\x80\x9cpluck\xe2\x80\x9d comes of breeding, so is endurance especially an\r\nattribute of the artist. Because he can stand outside himself, and (if\r\nthere be nothing ignoble in them) take a pleasure in his own sufferings,\r\nthe artist has a huge advantage over you and me. The Duke, so soon\r\nas Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s spell was broken, had become himself again--a highly\r\nself-conscious artist in life. And now, standing pensive on the\r\ndoorstep, he was almost enviable in his great affliction.\r\n\r\nThrough the wreaths of smoke which, as they came from his lips, hung in\r\nthe sultry air as they would have hung in a closed room, he gazed up at\r\nthe steadfast thunder-clouds. How nobly they had been massed for him!\r\nOne of them, a particularly large and dark one, might with advantage,\r\nhe thought, have been placed a little further to the left. He made a\r\ngesture to that effect. Instantly the cloud rolled into position.\r\nThe gods were painfully anxious, now, to humour him in trifles. His\r\nbehaviour in the great emergency had so impressed them at a distance\r\nthat they rather dreaded meeting him anon at close quarters. They rather\r\nwished they had not uncaged, last night, the two black owls. Too late.\r\nWhat they had done they had done.\r\n\r\nThat faint monotonous sound in the stillness of the night--the Duke\r\nremembered it now. What he had thought to be only his fancy had been\r\nhis death-knell, wafted to him along uncharted waves of ether, from the\r\nbattlements of Tankerton. It had ceased at daybreak. He wondered now\r\nthat he had not guessed its meaning. And he was glad that he had not.\r\nHe was thankful for the peace that had been granted to him, the joyous\r\narrogance in which he had gone to bed and got up for breakfast. He\r\nvalued these mercies the more for the great tragic irony that came of\r\nthem. Aye, and he was inclined to blame the gods for not having kept him\r\nstill longer in the dark and so made the irony still more awful. Why had\r\nthey not caused the telegram to be delayed in transmission? They\r\nought to have let him go and riddle Zuleika with his scorn and his\r\nindifference. They ought to have let him hurl through her his defiance\r\nof them. Art aside, they need not have grudged him that excursion.\r\n\r\nHe could not, he told himself, face Zuleika now. As artist, he saw that\r\nthere was irony enough left over to make the meeting a fine one. As\r\ntheologian, he did not hold her responsible for his destiny. But as a\r\nman, after what she had done to him last night, and before what he had\r\nto do for her to-day, he would not go out of his way to meet her. Of\r\ncourse, he would not actually avoid her. To seem to run away from her\r\nwere beneath his dignity. But, if he did meet her, what in heaven\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname should he say to her? He remembered his promise to lunch with The\r\nMacQuern, and shuddered. She would be there. Death, as he had said,\r\ncancelled all engagements. A very simple way out of the difficulty would\r\nbe to go straight to the river. No, that would be like running away. It\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be done.\r\n\r\nHardly had he rejected the notion when he had a glimpse of a female\r\nfigure coming quickly round the corner--a glimpse that sent him walking\r\nquickly away, across the road, towards Turl Street, blushing violently.\r\nHad she seen him? he asked himself. And had she seen that he saw her?\r\nHe heard her running after him. He did not look round, he quickened his\r\npace. She was gaining on him. Involuntarily, he ran--ran like a hare,\r\nand, at the corner of Turl Street, rose like a trout, saw the pavement\r\nrise at him, and fell, with a bang, prone.\r\n\r\nLet it be said at once that in this matter the gods were absolutely\r\nblameless. It is true they had decreed that a piece of orange-peel\r\nshould be thrown down this morning at the corner of Turl Street. But\r\nthe Master of Balliol, not the Duke, was the person they had destined\r\nto slip on it. You must not imagine that they think out and appoint\r\neverything that is to befall us, down to the smallest detail. Generally,\r\nthey just draw a sort of broad outline, and leave us to fill it in\r\naccording to our taste. Thus, in the matters of which this book is\r\nrecord, it was they who made the Warden invite his grand-daughter to\r\nOxford, and invite the Duke to meet her on the evening of her arrival.\r\nAnd it was they who prompted the Duke to die for her on the following\r\n(Tuesday) afternoon. They had intended that he should execute his\r\nresolve after, or before, the boat-race of that evening. But an\r\noversight upset this plan. They had forgotten on Monday night to uncage\r\nthe two black owls; and so it was necessary that the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s death should\r\nbe postponed. They accordingly prompted Zuleika to save him. For the\r\nrest, they let the tragedy run its own course--merely putting in a\r\nfelicitous touch here and there, or vetoing a superfluity, such as that\r\nKatie should open Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s letter. It was no part of their scheme that\r\nthe Duke should mistake Melisande for her mistress, or that he should\r\nrun away from her, and they were genuinely sorry when he, instead of the\r\nMaster of Balliol, came to grief over the orange-peel.\r\n\r\nThem, however, the Duke cursed as he fell; them again as he raised\r\nhimself on one elbow, giddy and sore; and when he found that the woman\r\nbending over him was not she whom he dreaded, but her innocent maid, it\r\nwas against them that he almost foamed at the mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur le Duc has done himself harm--no?\xe2\x80\x9d panted Melisande. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is\r\na letter from Miss Dobson\xe2\x80\x99s part. She say to me \xe2\x80\x98Give it him with your\r\nown hand.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke received the letter and, sitting upright, tore it to shreds,\r\nthus confirming a suspicion which Melisande had conceived at the moment\r\nwhen he took to his heels, that all English noblemen are mad, but mad,\r\nand of a madness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNom de Dieu,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, wringing her hands, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat shall I tell to\r\nMademoiselle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell her--\xe2\x80\x9d the Duke choked back a phrase of which the memory would\r\nhave shamed his last hours. \xe2\x80\x9cTell her,\xe2\x80\x9d he substituted, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you have\r\nseen Marius sitting among the ruins of Carthage,\xe2\x80\x9d and limped quickly\r\naway down the Turl.\r\n\r\nBoth his hands had been abraded by the fall. He tended them angrily\r\nwith his handkerchief. Mr. Druce, the chemist, had anon the privilege of\r\nbathing and plastering them, also of balming and binding the right knee\r\nand the left shin. \xe2\x80\x9cMight have been a very nasty accident, your Grace,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke. Mr. Druce concurred.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Mr. Druce\xe2\x80\x99s remark sank deep. The Duke thought it quite\r\nlikely that the gods had intended the accident to be fatal, and that\r\nonly by his own skill and lightness in falling had he escaped the\r\nignominy of dying in full flight from a lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid. He had not, you\r\nsee, lost all sense of free-will. While Mr. Druce put the finishing\r\ntouches to his shin, \xe2\x80\x9cI am utterly purposed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nfor this death of mine I will choose my own manner and my own--well, not\r\n\xe2\x80\x98time\xe2\x80\x99 exactly, but whatever moment within my brief span of life shall\r\nseem aptest to me. Unberufen,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, lightly tapping Mr. Druce\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncounter.\r\n\r\nThe sight of some bottles of Cold Mixture on that hospitable board\r\nreminded him of a painful fact. In the clash of the morning\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexcitements, he had hardly felt the gross ailment that was on him.\r\nHe became fully conscious of it now, and there leapt in him a hideous\r\ndoubt: had he escaped a violent death only to succumb to \xe2\x80\x9cnatural\r\ncauses\xe2\x80\x9d? He had never hitherto had anything the matter with him, and\r\nthus he belonged to the worst, the most apprehensive, class of patients.\r\nHe knew that a cold, were it neglected, might turn malignant; and he\r\nhad a vision of himself gripped suddenly in the street by internal\r\nagonies--a sympathetic crowd, an ambulance, his darkened bedroom; local\r\ndoctor making hopelessly wrong diagnosis; eminent specialists served up\r\nhot by special train, commending local doctor\xe2\x80\x99s treatment, but shaking\r\ntheir heads and refusing to say more than \xe2\x80\x9cHe has youth on his side\xe2\x80\x9d; a\r\nslight rally at sunset; the end. All this flashed through his mind. He\r\nquailed. There was not a moment to lose. He frankly confessed to Mr.\r\nDruce that he had a cold.\r\n\r\nMr. Druce, trying to insinuate by his manner that this fact had not been\r\nobvious, suggested the Mixture--a teaspoonful every two hours. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me\r\nsome now, please, at once,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke.\r\n\r\nHe felt magically better for the draught. He handled the little glass\r\nlovingly, and eyed the bottle. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not two teaspoonfuls every hour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he suggested, with an eagerness almost dipsomaniacal. But Mr. Druce was\r\nrespectfully firm against that. The Duke yielded. He fancied, indeed,\r\nthat the gods had meant him to die of an overdose.\r\n\r\nStill, he had a craving for more. Few though his hours were, he hoped\r\nthe next two would pass quickly. And, though he knew Mr. Druce could be\r\ntrusted to send the bottle round to his rooms immediately, he preferred\r\nto carry it away with him. He slipped it into the breast-pocket of his\r\ncoat, almost heedless of the slight extrusion it made there.\r\n\r\nJust as he was about to cross the High again, on his way home, a\r\nbutcher\xe2\x80\x99s cart dashed down the slope, recklessly driven. He stepped well\r\nback on the pavement, and smiled a sardonic smile. He looked to right\r\nand to left, carefully gauging the traffic. Some time elapsed before he\r\ndeemed the road clear enough for transit.\r\n\r\nSafely across, he encountered a figure that seemed to loom up out of the\r\ndim past. Oover! Was it but yesternight that Oover dined with him? With\r\nthe sensation of a man groping among archives, he began to apologise to\r\nthe Rhodes Scholar for having left him so abruptly at the Junta. Then,\r\npresto!--as though those musty archives were changed to a crisp morning\r\npaper agog with terrific head-lines--he remembered the awful resolve of\r\nOover, and of all young Oxford.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with a lightness that hardly hid his dread of the\r\nanswer, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have dismissed the notion you were toying with when I left\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOover\xe2\x80\x99s face, like his nature, was as sensitive as it was massive,\r\nand it instantly expressed his pain at the doubt cast on his high\r\nseriousness. \xe2\x80\x9cDuke,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cd\xe2\x80\x99you take me for a skunk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout pretending to be quite sure what a skunk is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take you to be all that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. And the high esteem in which I\r\nhold you is the measure for me of the loss that your death would be to\r\nAmerica and to Oxford.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOover blushed. \xe2\x80\x9cDuke\xe2\x80\x9d he said \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s a bully testimonial. But don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nworry. America can turn out millions just like me, and Oxford can have\r\nas many of them as she can hold. On the other hand, how many of YOU\r\ncan be turned out, as per sample, in England? Yet you choose to destroy\r\nyourself. You avail yourself of the Unwritten Law. And you\xe2\x80\x99re right,\r\nSir. Love transcends all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut does it? What if I told you I had changed my mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Duke,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oover, slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cI should believe that all those yarns\r\nI used to hear about the British aristocracy were true, after all. I\r\nshould aver that you were not a white man. Leading us on like that, and\r\nthen--Say, Duke! Are you going to die to-day, or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a matter of fact, I am, but--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOover wrung the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and was passing on. \xe2\x80\x9cStay!\xe2\x80\x9d he was adjured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSorry, unable. It\xe2\x80\x99s just turning eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve a lecture.\r\nWhile life lasts, I\xe2\x80\x99m bound to respect Rhodes\xe2\x80\x99 intentions.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nconscientious Scholar hurried away.\r\n\r\nThe Duke wandered down the High, taking counsel with himself. He was\r\nashamed of having so utterly forgotten the mischief he had wrought at\r\nlarge. At dawn he had vowed to undo it. Undo it he must. But the task\r\nwas not a simple one now. If he could say \xe2\x80\x9cBehold, I take back my word.\r\nI spurn Miss Dobson, and embrace life,\xe2\x80\x9d it was possible that his example\r\nwould suffice. But now that he could only say \xe2\x80\x9cBehold, I spurn Miss\r\nDobson, and will not die for her, but I am going to commit suicide, all\r\nthe same,\xe2\x80\x9d it was clear that his words would carry very little force.\r\nAlso, he saw with pain that they placed him in a somewhat ludicrous\r\nposition. His end, as designed yesterday, had a large and simple\r\ngrandeur. So had his recantation of it. But this new compromise between\r\nthe two things had a fumbled, a feeble, an ignoble look. It seemed to\r\ncombine all the disadvantages of both courses. It stained his honour\r\nwithout prolonging his life. Surely, this was a high price to pay for\r\nsnubbing Zuleika... Yes, he must revert without more ado to his first\r\nscheme. He must die in the manner that he had blazoned forth. And he\r\nmust do it with a good grace, none knowing he was not glad; else the\r\naction lost all dignity. True, this was no way to be a saviour. But only\r\nby not dying at all could he have set a really potent example.... He\r\nremembered the look that had come into Oover\xe2\x80\x99s eyes just now at the\r\nnotion of his unfaith. Perhaps he would have been the mock, not the\r\nsaviour, of Oxford. Better dishonour than death, maybe. But, since\r\ndie he must, he must die not belittling or tarnishing the name of\r\nTanville-Tankerton.\r\n\r\nWithin these bounds, however, he must put forth his full might to avert\r\nthe general catastrophe--and to punish Zuleika nearly well enough, after\r\nall, by intercepting that vast nosegay from her outstretched hands\r\nand her distended nostrils. There was no time to be lost, then. But he\r\nwondered, as he paced the grand curve between St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s and Magdalen\r\nBridge, just how was he to begin?\r\n\r\nDown the flight of steps from Queen\xe2\x80\x99s came lounging an average\r\nundergraduate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Smith,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9ca word with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my name is not Smith,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGenerically it is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are Smith to all intents\r\nand purposes. That, indeed, is why I address you. In making your\r\nacquaintance, I make a thousand acquaintances. You are a short cut to\r\nknowledge. Tell me, do you seriously think of drowning yourself this\r\nafternoon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather,\xe2\x80\x9d said the undergraduate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA meiosis in common use, equivalent to \xe2\x80\x98Yes, assuredly,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the\r\nDuke. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd why,\xe2\x80\x9d he then asked, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you mean to do this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? How can you ask? Why are YOU going to do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Socratic manner is not a game at which two can play. Please answer\r\nmy question, to the best of your ability.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, because I can\xe2\x80\x99t live without her. Because I want to prove my love\r\nfor her. Because--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne reason at a time please,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, holding up his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t live without her? Then I am to assume that you look forward to\r\ndying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are truly happy in that prospect?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Rather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, suppose I showed you two pieces of equally fine amber--a big one\r\nand a little one. Which of these would you rather possess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe big one, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this because it is better to have more than to have less of a good\r\nthing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you consider happiness a good thing or a bad one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that a man would rather have more than less of happiness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen does it not seem to you that you would do well to postpone your\r\nsuicide indefinitely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have just said I can\xe2\x80\x99t live without her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have still more recently declared yourself truly happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, be careful, Mr. Smith. Remember, this is a matter of life and\r\ndeath. Try to do yourself justice. I have asked you--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the undergraduate was walking away, not without a certain dignity.\r\n\r\nThe Duke felt that he had not handled his man skilfully. He remembered\r\nthat even Socrates, for all the popular charm of his mock-modesty and\r\nhis true geniality, had ceased after a while to be tolerable. Without\r\nsuch a manner to grace his method, Socrates would have had a very brief\r\ntime indeed. The Duke recoiled from what he took to be another pitfall.\r\nHe almost smelt hemlock.\r\n\r\nA party of four undergraduates abreast was approaching. How should he\r\naddress them? His choice wavered between the evangelic wistfulness of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you saved?\xe2\x80\x9d and the breeziness of the recruiting sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re fine upstanding young fellows. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a pity,\xe2\x80\x9d etc. Meanwhile,\r\nthe quartet had passed by.\r\n\r\nTwo other undergraduates approached. The Duke asked them simply as a\r\npersonal favour to himself not to throw away their lives. They said\r\nthey were very sorry, but in this particular matter they must please\r\nthemselves. In vain he pled. They admitted that but for his example they\r\nwould never have thought of dying. They wished they could show him their\r\ngratitude in any way but the one which would rob them of it.\r\n\r\nThe Duke drifted further down the High, bespeaking every undergraduate\r\nhe met, leaving untried no argument, no inducement. For one man, whose\r\nname he happened to know, he invented an urgent personal message from\r\nMiss Dobson imploring him not to die on her account. On another man he\r\noffered to settle by hasty codicil a sum of money sufficient to yield\r\nan annual income of two thousand pounds--three thousand--any sum within\r\nreason. With another he offered to walk, arm in arm, to Carfax and back\r\nagain. All to no avail.\r\n\r\nHe found himself in the precincts of Magdalen, preaching from the little\r\nopen-air pulpit there an impassioned sermon on the sacredness of human\r\nlife, and referring to Zuleika in terms which John Knox would have\r\nhesitated to utter. As he piled up the invective, he noticed an ominous\r\nrestiveness in the congregation--murmurs, clenching of hands, dark\r\nlooks. He saw the pulpit as yet another trap laid for him by the gods.\r\nHe had walked straight into it: another moment, and he might be dragged\r\ndown, overwhelmed by numbers, torn limb from limb. All that was in\r\nhim of quelling power he put hastily into his eyes, and manoeuvred his\r\ntongue to gentler discourse, deprecating his right to judge \xe2\x80\x9cthis lady,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and merely pointing the marvel, the awful though noble folly, of his\r\nresolve. He ended on a note of quiet pathos. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-night I shall be among\r\nthe shades. There be not you, my brothers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGood though the sermon was in style and sentiment, the flaw in its\r\nreasoning was too patent for any converts to be made. As he walked out\r\nof the quadrangle, the Duke felt the hopelessness of his cause. Still\r\nhe battled bravely for it up the High, waylaying, cajoling, commanding,\r\noffering vast bribes. He carried his crusade into the Loder, and\r\nthence into Vincent\xe2\x80\x99s, and out into the street again, eager, untiring,\r\nunavailing: everywhere he found his precept checkmated by his example.\r\n\r\nThe sight of The MacQuern coming out top-speed from the Market, with\r\na large but inexpensive bunch of flowers, reminded him of the luncheon\r\nthat was to be. Never to throw over an engagement was for him, as we\r\nhave seen, a point of honour. But this particular engagement--hateful,\r\nwhen he accepted it, by reason of his love--was now impossible for\r\nthe reason which had made him take so ignominiously to his heels this\r\nmorning. He curtly told the Scot not to expect him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs SHE not coming?\xe2\x80\x9d gasped the Scot, with quick suspicion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, turning on his heel, \xe2\x80\x9cshe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\r\nshan\xe2\x80\x99t be there. You may count on her.\xe2\x80\x9d This he took to be the very\r\ntruth, and he was glad to have made of it a thrust at the man who had\r\nso uncouthly asserted himself last night. He could not help smiling,\r\nthough, at this little resentment erect after the cataclysm that had\r\nswept away all else. Then he smiled to think how uneasy Zuleika would\r\nbe at his absence. What agonies of suspense she must have had all this\r\nmorning! He imagined her silent at the luncheon, with a vacant gaze at\r\nthe door, eating nothing at all. And he became aware that he was rather\r\nhungry. He had done all he could to save young Oxford. Now for some\r\nsandwiches! He went into the Junta.\r\n\r\nAs he rang the dining-room bell, his eyes rested on the miniature of\r\nNellie O\xe2\x80\x99Mora. And the eyes of Nellie O\xe2\x80\x99Mora seemed to meet his in\r\nreproach. Just as she may have gazed at Greddon when he cast her off,\r\nso now did she gaze at him who a few hours ago had refused to honour her\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nYes, and many other eyes than hers rebuked him. It was around the walls\r\nof this room that hung those presentments of the Junta as focussed,\r\nyear after year, in a certain corner of Tom Quad, by Messrs. Hills and\r\nSaunders. All around, the members of the little hierarchy, a hierarchy\r\never changing in all but youth and a certain sternness of aspect that\r\ncomes at the moment of being immortalised, were gazing forth now with a\r\nsternness beyond their wont. Not one of them but had in his day handed\r\non loyally the praise of Nellie O\xe2\x80\x99Mora, in the form their Founder had\r\nordained. And the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s revolt last night had so incensed them that\r\nthey would, if they could, have come down from their frames and walked\r\nstraight out of the club, in chronological order--first, the men of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98sixties, almost as near in time to Greddon as to the Duke, all\r\nso gloriously be-whiskered and cravated, but how faded now, alas, by\r\nexposure; and last of all in the procession and angrier perhaps than any\r\nof them, the Duke himself--the Duke of a year ago, President and sole\r\nMember.\r\n\r\nBut, as he gazed into the eyes of Nellie O\xe2\x80\x99Mora now, Dorset needed not\r\nfor penitence the reproaches of his past self or of his forerunners.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSweet girl,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cforgive me. I was mad. I was under the\r\nsway of a deplorable infatuation. It is past. See,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured with a\r\ndelicacy of feeling that justified the untruth, \xe2\x80\x9cI am come here for the\r\nexpress purpose of undoing my impiety.\xe2\x80\x9d And, turning to the club-waiter\r\nwho at this moment answered the bell, he said \xe2\x80\x9cBring me a glass of port,\r\nplease, Barrett.\xe2\x80\x9d Of sandwiches he said nothing.\r\n\r\nAt the word \xe2\x80\x9cSee\xe2\x80\x9d he had stretched one hand towards Nellie; the other\r\nhe had laid on his heart, where it seemed to encounter some sort of hard\r\nobstruction. This he vaguely fingered, wondering what it might be, while\r\nhe gave his order to Barrett. With a sudden cry he dipped his hand into\r\nhis breast-pocket and drew forth the bottle he had borne away from\r\nMr. Druce\xe2\x80\x99s. He snatched out his watch: one o\xe2\x80\x99clock!--fifteen minutes\r\noverdue. Wildly he called the waiter back. \xe2\x80\x9cA tea-spoon, quick! No\r\nport. A wine-glass and a tea-spoon. And--for I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind telling you,\r\nBarrett, that your mission is of an urgency beyond conjecture--take\r\nlightning for your model. Go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgitation mastered him. He tried vainly to feel his pulse, well knowing\r\nthat if he found it he could deduce nothing from its action. He saw\r\nhimself haggard in the looking-glass. Would Barrett never come? \xe2\x80\x9cEvery\r\ntwo hours\xe2\x80\x9d--the directions were explicit. Had he delivered himself into\r\nthe gods\xe2\x80\x99 hands? The eyes of Nellie O\xe2\x80\x99Mora were on him compassionately;\r\nand all the eyes of his forerunners were on him in austere scorn: \xe2\x80\x9cSee,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n they seemed to be saying, \xe2\x80\x9cthe chastisement of last night\xe2\x80\x99s blasphemy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Violently, insistently, he rang the bell.\r\n\r\nIn rushed Barrett at last. From the tea-spoon into the wine-glass the\r\nDuke poured the draught of salvation, and then, raising it aloft, he\r\nlooked around at his fore-runners and in a firm voice cried \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\r\nI give you Nellie O\xe2\x80\x99Mora, the fairest witch that ever was or will be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He drained his glass, heaved the deep sigh of a double satisfaction,\r\ndismissed with a glance the wondering Barrett, and sat down.\r\n\r\nHe was glad to be able to face Nellie with a clear conscience. Her eyes\r\nwere not less sad now, but it seemed to him that their sadness came of a\r\nknowledge that she would never see him again. She seemed to be saying\r\nto him \xe2\x80\x9cHad you lived in my day, it is you that I would have loved, not\r\nGreddon.\xe2\x80\x9d And he made silent answer, \xe2\x80\x9cHad you lived in my day, I should\r\nhave been Dobson-proof.\xe2\x80\x9d He realised, however, that to Zuleika he owed\r\nthe tenderness he now felt for Miss O\xe2\x80\x99Mora. It was Zuleika that had\r\ncured him of his aseity. She it was that had made his heart a warm and\r\nnegotiable thing. Yes, and that was the final cruelty. To love and be\r\nloved--this, he had come to know, was all that mattered. Yesterday, to\r\nlove and die had seemed felicity enough. Now he knew that the secret,\r\nthe open secret, of happiness was in mutual love--a state that needed\r\nnot the fillip of death. And he had to die without having ever lived.\r\nAdmiration, homage, fear, he had sown broadcast. The one woman who had\r\nloved him had turned to stone because he loved her. Death would lose\r\nmuch of its sting for him if there were somewhere in the world just one\r\nwoman, however lowly, whose heart would be broken by his dying. What a\r\npity Nellie O\xe2\x80\x99Mora was not really extant!\r\n\r\nSuddenly he recalled certain words lightly spoken yesterday by Zuleika.\r\nShe had told him he was loved by the girl who waited on him--the\r\ndaughter of his landlady. Was this so? He had seen no sign of it, had\r\nreceived no token of it. But, after all, how should he have seen a sign\r\nof anything in one whom he had never consciously visualised? That she\r\nhad never thrust herself on his notice might mean merely that she had\r\nbeen well brought-up. What likelier than that the daughter of Mrs.\r\nBatch, that worthy soul, had been well brought up?\r\n\r\nHere, at any rate, was the chance of a new element in his life, or\r\nrather in his death. Here, possibly, was a maiden to mourn him. He would\r\nlunch in his rooms.\r\n\r\nWith a farewell look at Nellie\xe2\x80\x99s miniature, he took the medicine-bottle\r\nfrom the table, and went quickly out. The heavens had grown steadily\r\ndarker and darker, the air more sulphurous and baleful. And the High had\r\na strangely woebegone look, being all forsaken by youth, in this hour of\r\nluncheon. Even so would its look be all to-morrow, thought the Duke,\r\nand for many morrows. Well he had done what he could. He was free now to\r\nbrighten a little his own last hours. He hastened on, eager to see the\r\nlandlady\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. He wondered what she was like, and whether she\r\nreally loved him.\r\n\r\nAs he threw open the door of his sitting-room, he was aware of a rustle,\r\na rush, a cry. In another instant, he was aware of Zuleika Dobson at his\r\nfeet, at his knees, clasping him to her, sobbing, laughing, sobbing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nFor what happened a few moments later you must not blame him. Some\r\nmeasure of force was the only way out of an impossible situation. It was\r\nin vain that he commanded the young lady to let go: she did but cling\r\nthe closer. It was in vain that he tried to disentangle himself of her\r\nby standing first on one foot, then on the other, and veering sharply on\r\nhis heel: she did but sway as though hinged to him. He had no choice but\r\nto grasp her by the wrists, cast her aside, and step clear of her into\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nHer hat, gauzily basking with a pair of long white gloves on one of his\r\narm-chairs, proclaimed that she had come to stay.\r\n\r\nNor did she rise. Propped on one elbow, with heaving bosom and parted\r\nlips, she seemed to be trying to realise what had been done to her.\r\nThrough her undried tears her eyes shone up to him.\r\n\r\nHe asked: \xe2\x80\x9cTo what am I indebted for this visit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, say that again!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cYour voice is music.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe repeated his question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMusic!\xe2\x80\x9d she said dreamily; and such is the force of habit that \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cknow anything about music, really. But I know what I\r\nlike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad you not better get up from the floor?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe door is open,\r\nand any one who passed might see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSoftly she stroked the carpet with the palms of her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cHappy\r\ncarpet!\xe2\x80\x9d she crooned. \xe2\x80\x9cAye, happy the very women that wove the threads\r\nthat are trod by the feet of my beloved master. But hark! he bids his\r\nslave rise and stand before him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust after she had risen, a figure appeared in the doorway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg pardon, your Grace; Mother wants to know, will you be lunching\r\nin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cI will ring when I am ready.\xe2\x80\x9d And it dawned on\r\nhim that this girl, who perhaps loved him, was, according to all known\r\nstandards, extraordinarily pretty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill--\xe2\x80\x9d she hesitated, \xe2\x80\x9cwill Miss Dobson be--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be alone.\xe2\x80\x9d And there was in the girl\xe2\x80\x99s parting\r\nhalf-glance at Zuleika that which told him he was truly loved, and made\r\nhim the more impatient of his offensive and accursed visitor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want to be rid of me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Zuleika, when the girl was gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no wish to be rude; but--since you force me to say it--yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen take me,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, throwing back her arms, \xe2\x80\x9cand throw me out of\r\nthe window.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean it? You think I would struggle? Try me.\xe2\x80\x9d She let\r\nherself droop sideways, in an attitude limp and portable. \xe2\x80\x9cTry me,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this is very well conceived, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand well\r\nexecuted. But it happens to be otiose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean you may set your mind at rest. I am not going to back out of my\r\npromise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZuleika flushed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are cruel. I would give the world and all not to\r\nhave written you that hateful letter. Forget it, forget it, for pity\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke looked searchingly at her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that you now wish to\r\nrelease me from my promise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRelease you? As if you were ever bound! Don\xe2\x80\x99t torture me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wondered what deep game she was playing. Very real, though, her\r\nanguish seemed; and, if real it was, then--he stared, he gasped--there\r\ncould be but one explanation. He put it to her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou love me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis heart leapt. If she spoke truth, then indeed vengeance was his! But\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat proof have I?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProof? Have men absolutely NO intuition? If you need proof, produce it.\r\nWhere are my ear-rings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour ear-rings? Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nImpatiently she pointed to two white pearls that fastened the front\r\nof her blouse. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are your studs. It was from them I had the great\r\nfirst hint this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlack and pink, were they not, when you took them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. And then I forgot that I had them. When I undressed, they\r\nmust have rolled on to the carpet. Melisande found them this morning\r\nwhen she was making the room ready for me to dress. That was just after\r\nshe came back from bringing you my first letter. I was bewildered. I\r\ndoubted. Might not the pearls have gone back to their natural state\r\nsimply through being yours no more? That is why I wrote again to you, my\r\nown darling--a frantic little questioning letter. When I heard how you\r\nhad torn it up, I knew, I knew that the pearls had not mocked me. I\r\ntelescoped my toilet and came rushing round to you. How many hours have\r\nI been waiting for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke had drawn her ear-rings from his waistcoat pocket, and was\r\ncontemplating them in the palm of his hand. Blanched, both of them, yes.\r\nHe laid them on the table. \xe2\x80\x9cTake them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she shuddered. \xe2\x80\x9cI could never forget that once they were both\r\nblack.\xe2\x80\x9d She flung them into the fender. \xe2\x80\x9cOh John,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, turning to\r\nhim and falling again to her knees, \xe2\x80\x9cI do so want to forget what I have\r\nbeen. I want to atone. You think you can drive me out of your life. You\r\ncannot, darling--since you won\xe2\x80\x99t kill me. Always I shall follow you on\r\nmy knees, thus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked down at her over his folded arms,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not going to back out of my promise,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\r\n\r\nShe stopped her ears.\r\n\r\nWith a stern joy he unfolded his arms, took some papers from his\r\nbreast-pocket, and, selecting one of them, handed it to her. It was the\r\ntelegram sent by his steward.\r\n\r\nShe read it. With a stern joy he watched her reading it.\r\n\r\nWild-eyed, she looked up from it to him, tried to speak, and swerved\r\ndown senseless.\r\n\r\nHe had not foreseen this. \xe2\x80\x9cHelp!\xe2\x80\x9d he vaguely cried--was she not a\r\nfellow-creature?--and rushed blindly out to his bedroom, whence he\r\nreturned, a moment later, with the water-jug. He dipped his hand, and\r\nsprinkled the upturned face (Dew-drops on a white rose? But some\r\nother, sharper analogy hovered to him). He dipped and sprinkled. The\r\nwater-beads broke, mingled--rivulets now. He dipped and flung, then\r\ncaught the horrible analogy and rebounded.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that Zuleika opened her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere am I?\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nweakly raised herself on one elbow; and the suspension of the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhatred would have been repealed simultaneously with that of her\r\nconsciousness, had it not already been repealed by the analogy. She put\r\na hand to her face, then looked at the wet palm wonderingly, looked at\r\nthe Duke, saw the water-jug beside him. She, too, it seemed, had caught\r\nthe analogy; for with a wan smile she said \xe2\x80\x9cWe are quits now, John,\r\naren\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer poor little jest drew to the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s face no answering smile, did\r\nbut make hotter the blush there. The wave of her returning memory swept\r\non--swept up to her with a roar the instant past. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried,\r\nstaggering to her feet, \xe2\x80\x9cthe owls, the owls!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVengeance was his, and \xe2\x80\x9cYes, there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis the ineluctable hard\r\nfact you wake to. The owls have hooted. The gods have spoken. This day\r\nyour wish is to be fulfilled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe owls have hooted. The gods have spoken. This day--oh, it must not\r\nbe, John! Heaven have mercy on me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe unerring owls have hooted. The dispiteous and humorous gods have\r\nspoken. Miss Dobson, it has to be. And let me remind you,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\nwith a glance at his watch, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you ought not to keep The MacQuern\r\nwaiting for luncheon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is unworthy of you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. There was in her eyes a look that\r\nmade the words sound as if they had been spoken by a dumb animal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have sent him an excuse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have forgotten him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is unworthy of you. After all, he is going to die for you, like\r\nthe rest of us. I am but one of a number, you know. Use your sense of\r\nproportion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I do that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may not be pleased by the\r\nissue. I may find that whereas yesterday I was great in my sinfulness,\r\nand to-day am great in my love, you, in your hate of me, are small. I\r\nmay find that what I had taken to be a great indifference is nothing but\r\na very small hate... Ah, I have wounded you? Forgive me, a weak woman,\r\ntalking at random in her wretchedness. Oh John, John, if I thought you\r\nsmall, my love would but take on the crown of pity. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forbid me to\r\ncall you John. I looked you up in Debrett while I was waiting for you.\r\nThat seemed to bring you nearer to me. So many other names you have,\r\ntoo. I remember you told me them all yesterday, here in this room--not\r\ntwenty-four hours ago. Hours? Years!\xe2\x80\x9d She laughed hysterically. \xe2\x80\x9cJohn,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you see why I won\xe2\x80\x99t stop talking? It\xe2\x80\x99s because I dare not think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYonder in Balliol,\xe2\x80\x9d he suavely said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will find the matter of my\r\ndeath easier to forget than here.\xe2\x80\x9d He took her hat and gloves from the\r\narm-chair, and held them carefully out to her; but she did not take\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give you three minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d he told her. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo minutes, that is, in\r\nwhich to make yourself tidy before the mirror. A third in which to say\r\ngood-bye and be outside the front-door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I refuse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall send for a policeman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked well at him. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she slowly said, \xe2\x80\x9cI think you would do\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took her things from him, and laid them by the mirror. With a high\r\nhand she quelled the excesses of her hair--some of the curls still\r\nagleam with water--and knowingly poised and pinned her hat. Then, after\r\na few swift touches and passes at neck and waist, she took her gloves\r\nand, wheeling round to him, \xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been quick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdmirably,\xe2\x80\x9d he allowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick in more than meets the eye, John. Spiritually quick. You saw me\r\nputting on my hat; you did not see love taking on the crown of pity, and\r\nme bonneting her with it, tripping her up and trampling the life out of\r\nher. Oh, a most cold-blooded business, John! Had to be done, though. No\r\nother way out. So I just used my sense of proportion, as you rashly\r\nbade me, and then hardened my heart at sight of you as you are. One of\r\na number? Yes, and a quite unlovable unit. So I am all right again. And\r\nnow, where is Balliol? Far from here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, choking a little, as might a card-player who, having\r\nbeen dealt a splendid hand, and having played it with flawless skill,\r\nhas yet--damn it!--lost the odd trick. \xe2\x80\x9cBalliol is quite near. At the\r\nend of this street in fact. I can show it to you from the front-door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, he had controlled himself. But this, he furiously felt, did not\r\nmake him look the less a fool. What ought he to have SAID? He prayed,\r\nas he followed the victorious young woman downstairs, that l\xe2\x80\x99esprit de\r\nl\xe2\x80\x99escalier might befall him. Alas, it did not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when he had shown her where Balliol lay, \xe2\x80\x9chave\r\nyou told anybody that you aren\xe2\x80\x99t dying just for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI have preferred not to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen officially, as it were, and in the eyes of the world, you die for\r\nme? Then all\xe2\x80\x99s well that ends well. Shall we say good-bye here? I\r\nshall be on the Judas Barge; but I suppose there will be a crush, as\r\nyesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure to be. There always is on the last night of the Eights, you know.\r\nGood-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, little John--small John,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried across her shoulder,\r\nhaving the last word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nHe might not have grudged her the last word, had she properly needed\r\nit. Its utter superfluity--the perfection of her victory without it--was\r\nwhat galled him. Yes, she had outflanked him, taken him unawares, and he\r\nhad fired not one shot. Esprit de l\xe2\x80\x99escalier--it was as he went upstairs\r\nthat he saw how he might yet have snatched from her, if not the victory,\r\nthe palm. Of course he ought to have laughed aloud--\xe2\x80\x9cCapital, capital!\r\nYou really do deserve to fool me. But ah, yours is a love that can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\ndissembled. Never was man by maiden loved more ardently than I by you,\r\nmy poor girl, at this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd stay!--what if she really HAD been but pretending to have killed her\r\nlove? He paused on the threshold of his room. The sudden doubt made his\r\nlost chance the more sickening. Yet was the doubt dear to him ... What\r\nlikelier, after all, than that she had been pretending? She had already\r\ntwitted him with his lack of intuition. He had not seen that she\r\nloved him when she certainly did love him. He had needed the pearls\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndemonstration of that.--The pearls! THEY would betray her. He darted to\r\nthe fender, and one of them he espied there instantly--white? A rather\r\nflushed white, certainly. For the other he had to peer down. There it\r\nlay, not very distinct on the hearth\xe2\x80\x99s black-leading.\r\n\r\nHe turned away. He blamed himself for not dismissing from his mind the\r\nhussy he had dismissed from his room. Oh for an ounce of civet and a\r\nfew poppies! The water-jug stood as a reminder of the hateful visit\r\nand of... He took it hastily away into his bedroom. There he washed\r\nhis hands. The fact that he had touched Zuleika gave to this ablution a\r\nsymbolism that made it the more refreshing.\r\n\r\nCivet, poppies? Was there not, at his call, a sweeter perfume, a\r\nstronger anodyne? He rang the bell, almost caressingly.\r\n\r\nHis heart beat at sound of the clinking and rattling of the tray borne\r\nup the stairs. She was coming, the girl who loved him, the girl whose\r\nheart would be broken when he died. Yet, when the tray appeared in the\r\ndoorway, and she behind it, the tray took precedence of her in his soul\r\nnot less than in his sight. Twice, after an arduous morning, had his\r\nluncheon been postponed, and the coming of it now made intolerable the\r\npangs of his hunger.\r\n\r\nAlso, while the girl laid the table-cloth, it occurred to him how\r\nflimsy, after all, was the evidence that she loved him. Suppose she\r\ndid nothing of the kind! At the Junta, he had foreseen no difficulty in\r\nasking her. Now he found himself a prey to embarrassment. He wondered\r\nwhy. He had not failed in flow of gracious words to Nellie O\xe2\x80\x99Mora. Well,\r\na miniature by Hoppner was one thing, a landlady\xe2\x80\x99s live daughter was\r\nanother. At any rate, he must prime himself with food. He wished Mrs.\r\nBatch had sent up something more calorific than cold salmon. He asked\r\nher daughter what was to follow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a pigeon-pie, your Grace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCold? Then please ask your mother to heat it in the oven--quickly.\r\nAnything after that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA custard pudding, your Grace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCold? Let this, too, be heated. And bring up a bottle of champagne,\r\nplease; and--and a bottle of port.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis was a head that had always hitherto defied the grape. But he thought\r\nthat to-day, by all he had gone through, by all the shocks he had\r\nsuffered, and the strains he had steeled himself to bear, as well as by\r\nthe actual malady that gripped him, he might perchance have been sapped\r\nenough to experience by reaction that cordial glow of which he had now\r\nand again seen symptoms in his fellows.\r\n\r\nNor was he altogether disappointed of this hope. As the meal progressed,\r\nand the last of the champagne sparkled in his glass, certain things\r\nsaid to him by Zuleika--certain implied criticisms that had rankled,\r\nyes--lost their power to discommode him. He was able to smile at the\r\nimpertinences of an angry woman, the tantrums of a tenth-rate conjurer\r\ntold to go away. He felt he had perhaps acted harshly. With all her\r\nfaults, she had adored him. Yes, he had been arbitrary. There seemed to\r\nbe a strain of brutality in his nature. Poor Zuleika! He was glad for\r\nher that she had contrived to master her infatuation... Enough for him\r\nthat he was loved by this exquisite meek girl who had served him at the\r\nfeast. Anon, when he summoned her to clear the things away, he would bid\r\nher tell him the tale of her lowly passion. He poured a second glass\r\nof port, sipped it, quaffed it, poured a third. The grey gloom of the\r\nweather did but, as he eyed the bottle, heighten his sense of the rich\r\nsunshine so long ago imprisoned by the vintner and now released to make\r\nglad his soul. Even so to be released was the love pent for him in the\r\nheart of this sweet girl. Would that he loved her in return!... Why not?\r\n\r\n\r\n                             \xe2\x80\x9cPrius insolentem\r\n                    Serva Briseis niveo colore\r\n                          Movit Achillem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nNor were it gracious to invite an avowal of love and offer none in\r\nreturn. Yet, yet, expansive though his mood was, he could not pretend to\r\nhimself that he was about to feel in this girl\xe2\x80\x99s presence anything but\r\ngratitude. He might pretend to her? Deception were a very poor return\r\nindeed for all her kindness. Besides, it might turn her head. Some small\r\ntoken of his gratitude--some trinket by which to remember him--was all\r\nthat he could allow himself to offer... What trinket? Would she like\r\nto have one of his scarf-pins? Studs? Still more abs--Ah! he had it, he\r\nliterally and most providentially had it, there, in the fender: a pair\r\nof ear-rings!\r\n\r\nHe plucked the pink pearl and the black from where they lay, and rang\r\nthe bell.\r\n\r\nHis sense of dramatic propriety needed that the girl should, before he\r\naddressed her, perform her task of clearing the table. If she had it\r\nto perform after telling her love, and after receiving his gift and his\r\nfarewell, the bathos would be distressing for them both.\r\n\r\nBut, while he watched her at her task, he did wish she would be a little\r\nquicker. For the glow in him seemed to be cooling momently. He wished\r\nhe had had more than three glasses from the crusted bottle which she was\r\nputting away into the chiffonier. Down, doubt! Down, sense of disparity!\r\nThe moment was at hand. Would he let it slip? Now she was folding up the\r\ntable-cloth, now she was going.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay!\xe2\x80\x9d he uttered. \xe2\x80\x9cI have something to say to you.\xe2\x80\x9d The girl turned to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe forced his eyes to meet hers. \xe2\x80\x9cI understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a\r\nconstrained voice, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you regard me with sentiments of something more\r\nthan esteem.--Is this so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl had stepped quickly back, and her face was scarlet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, having to go through with it now, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no cause for\r\nembarrassment. And I am sure you will acquit me of wanton curiosity. Is\r\nit a fact that you--love me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tried to speak, could not. But she nodded her head.\r\n\r\nThe Duke, much relieved, came nearer to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKatie,\xe2\x80\x9d she was able to gasp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Katie, how long have you loved me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEver since,\xe2\x80\x9d she faltered, \xe2\x80\x9cever since you came to engage the rooms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not, of course, given to idolising any tenant of your\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I boast myself the first possessor of your heart?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d She had become very pale now, and was trembling painfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd may I assume that your love for me has been entirely\r\ndisinterested?... You do not catch my meaning? I will put my question in\r\nanother way. In loving me, you never supposed me likely to return your\r\nlove?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl looked up at him quickly, but at once her eyelids fluttered\r\ndown again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cMy question is a plain one. Did you ever\r\nfor an instant suppose, Katie, that I might come to love you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a whisper; \xe2\x80\x9cI never dared to hope that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou never imagined that you had anything to\r\ngain by your affection. You were not contriving a trap for me. You were\r\nupheld by no hope of becoming a young Duchess, with more frocks than\r\nyou could wear and more dross than you could scatter. I am glad. I\r\nam touched. You are the first woman that has loved me in that way. Or\r\nrather,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cthe first but one. And she... Answer me,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, standing over the girl, and speaking with a great intensity. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\r\nwere to tell you that I loved you, would you cease to love me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh your Grace!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy no! I never dared--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe catechism is ended. I have something which I\r\nshould like to give you. Are your ears pierced?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your Grace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Katie, honour me by accepting this present.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, he placed\r\nin the girl\xe2\x80\x99s hand the black pearl and the pink. The sight of them\r\nbanished for a moment all other emotions in their recipient. She forgot\r\nherself. \xe2\x80\x9cLor!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you will wear them always for my sake,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke.\r\n\r\nShe had expressed herself in the monosyllable. No words came to her\r\nlips, but to her eyes many tears, through which the pearls were\r\nvisible. They whirled in her bewildered brain as a token that she was\r\nloved--loved by HIM, though but yesterday he had loved another. It was\r\nall so sudden, so beautiful. You might have knocked her down (she says\r\nso to this day) with a feather. Seeing her agitation, the Duke pointed\r\nto a chair, bade her be seated.\r\n\r\nHer mind was cleared by the new posture. Suspicion crept into it,\r\nfollowed by alarm. She looked at the ear-rings, then up at the Duke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, misinterpreting the question in her eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are real\r\npearls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t that,\xe2\x80\x9d she quavered, \xe2\x80\x9cit is--it is--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat they were given to me by Miss Dobson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, they were, were they? Then\xe2\x80\x9d--Katie rose, throwing the pearls on the\r\nfloor--\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have nothing to do with them. I hate her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, in a burst of confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease forget that I said that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt occurred to Katie that Miss Dobson would be ill-pleased that the\r\npearls should pass to her. She picked them up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly--only--\xe2\x80\x9d again her doubts beset her and she looked from the pearls\r\nto the Duke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak on,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you aren\xe2\x80\x99t playing with me, are you? You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean me harm, do you?\r\nI have been well brought up. I have been warned against things. And it\r\nseems so strange, what you have said to me. You are a Duke, and I--I am\r\nonly--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the privilege of nobility to condescend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI see. Oh I was wicked to doubt you. And love\r\nlevels all, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it? love and the Board school. Our stations are far\r\napart, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve been educated far above mine. I\xe2\x80\x99ve learnt more than most\r\nreal ladies have. I passed the Seventh Standard when I was only just\r\nfourteen. I was considered one of the sharpest girls in the school. And\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve gone on learning since then,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cI utilise all\r\nmy spare moments. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read twenty-seven of the Hundred Best Books. I\r\ncollect ferns. I play the piano, whenever...\xe2\x80\x9d She broke off, for she\r\nremembered that her music was always interrupted by the ringing of the\r\nDuke\xe2\x80\x99s bell and a polite request that it should cease.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to hear of these accomplishments. They do you great credit, I\r\nam sure. But--well, I do not quite see why you enumerate them just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t that I am vain,\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cI only mentioned them because\r\n... oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? If I\xe2\x80\x99m not ignorant, I shan\xe2\x80\x99t disgrace you.\r\nPeople won\xe2\x80\x99t be so able to say you\xe2\x80\x99ve been and thrown yourself away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrown myself away? What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, they\xe2\x80\x99ll make all sorts of objections, I know. They\xe2\x80\x99ll all be\r\nagainst me, and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, explain yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour aunt, she looked a very proud lady--very high and hard. I thought\r\nso when she came here last term. But you\xe2\x80\x99re of age. You\xe2\x80\x99re your own\r\nmaster. Oh, I trust you; you\xe2\x80\x99ll stand by me. If you love me really you\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t listen to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove you? I? Are you mad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEach stared at the other, utterly bewildered.\r\n\r\nThe girl was the first to break the silence. Her voice came in a\r\nwhisper. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve not been playing a joke on me? You meant what you said,\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I said?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said you loved me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be dreaming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not. Here are the ear-rings you gave me.\xe2\x80\x9d She pinched them as\r\nmaterial proof. \xe2\x80\x9cYou said you loved me just before you gave me them.\r\nYou know you did. And if I thought you\xe2\x80\x99d been laughing at me all the\r\ntime--I\xe2\x80\x99d--I\xe2\x80\x99d\xe2\x80\x9d--a sob choked her voice--\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d throw them in your face!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not speak to me in that manner,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke coldly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nlet me warn you that this attempt to trap me and intimidate me--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl had flung the ear-rings at his face. She had missed her mark.\r\nBut this did not extenuate the outrageous gesture. He pointed to the\r\ndoor. \xe2\x80\x9cGo!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t try that on!\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t go--not unless you drag\r\nme out. And if you do that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll raise the house. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have in the\r\nneighbours. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell them all what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done, and--\xe2\x80\x9d But defiance\r\nmelted in the hot shame of humiliation. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you coward!\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou coward!\xe2\x80\x9d She caught her apron to her face and, swaying against the\r\nwall, sobbed piteously.\r\n\r\nUnaccustomed to love-affairs, the Duke could not sail lightly over a\r\nflood of woman\xe2\x80\x99s tears. He was filled with pity for the poor quivering\r\nfigure against the wall. How should he soothe her? Mechanically he\r\npicked up the two pearls from the carpet, and crossed to her side. He\r\ntouched her on the shoulder. She shuddered away from him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gently. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t cry. I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it. I have been stupid\r\nand thoughtless. What did you say your name was? \xe2\x80\x98Katie,\xe2\x80\x99 to be sure.\r\nWell, Katie, I want to beg your pardon. I expressed myself badly. I was\r\nunhappy and lonely, and I saw in you a means of comfort. I snatched\r\nat you, Katie, as at a straw. And then, I suppose, I must have said\r\nsomething which made you think I loved you. I almost wish I did. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwonder you threw the ear-rings at me. I--I almost wish they had hit\r\nme... You see, I have quite forgiven you. Now do you forgive me. You\r\nwill not refuse now to wear the ear-rings. I gave them to you as a\r\nkeepsake. Wear them always in memory of me. For you will never see me\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl had ceased from crying, and her anger had spent itself in sobs.\r\nShe was gazing at him woebegone but composed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not ask that,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cEnough that my wings are spread.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going because of ME?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least. Indeed, your devotion is one of the things which make\r\nbitter my departure. And yet--I am glad you love me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x9d she faltered. He came nearer to her, and this time she did\r\nnot shrink from him. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you find the rooms comfortable?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked,\r\ngazing up at him. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever had any complaint to make about the\r\nattendance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cthe attendance has always been quite satisfactory.\r\nI have never felt that so keenly as I do to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why are you leaving? Why are you breaking my heart?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuffice it that I cannot do otherwise. Henceforth you will see me no\r\nmore. But I doubt not that in the cultivation of my memory you will find\r\nsome sort of lugubrious satisfaction. See! here are the ear-rings. If\r\nyou like, I will put them in with my own hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held up her face side-ways. Into the lobe of her left ear he\r\ninsinuated the hook of the black pearl. On the cheek upturned to him\r\nthere were still traces of tears; the eyelashes were still spangled. For\r\nall her blondness, they were quite dark, these glistening eyelashes. He\r\nhad an impulse, which he put from him. \xe2\x80\x9cNow the other ear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. The\r\ngirl turned her head. Soon the pink pearl was in its place. Yet the girl\r\ndid not move. She seemed to be waiting. Nor did the Duke himself seem to\r\nbe quite satisfied. He let his fingers dally with the pearl. Anon, with\r\na sigh, he withdrew them. The girl looked up. Their eyes met. He looked\r\naway from her. He turned away from her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may kiss my hand,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nmurmured, extending it towards her. After a pause, the warm pressure\r\nof her lips was laid on it. He sighed, but did not look round. Another\r\npause, a longer pause, and then the clatter and clink of the outgoing\r\ntray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nHer actual offspring does not suffice a very motherly woman. Such a\r\nwoman was Mrs. Batch. Had she been blest with a dozen children, she\r\nmust yet have regarded herself as also a mother to whatever two young\r\ngentlemen were lodging under her roof. Childless but for Katie and\r\nClarence, she had for her successive pairs of tenants a truly vast fund\r\nof maternal feeling to draw on. Nor were the drafts made in secret. To\r\nevery gentleman, from the outset, she proclaimed the relation in which\r\nshe would stand to him. Moreover, always she needed a strong filial\r\nsense in return: this was only fair.\r\n\r\nBecause the Duke was an orphan, even more than because he was a Duke,\r\nher heart had with a special rush gone out to him when he and Mr. Noaks\r\nbecame her tenants. But, perhaps because he had never known a mother,\r\nhe was evidently quite incapable of conceiving either Mrs. Batch as his\r\nmother or himself as her son. Indeed, there was that in his manner,\r\nin his look, which made her falter, for once, in exposition of her\r\ntheory--made her postpone the matter to some more favourable time. That\r\ntime never came, somehow. Still, her solicitude for him, her pride in\r\nhim, her sense that he was a great credit to her, rather waxed than\r\nwaned. He was more to her (such are the vagaries of the maternal\r\ninstinct) than Katie or Mr. Noaks: he was as much as Clarence.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, a deeply agitated woman who now came heaving up into\r\nthe Duke\xe2\x80\x99s presence. His Grace was \xe2\x80\x9cgiving notice\xe2\x80\x9d? She was sure she\r\nbegged his pardon for coming up so sudden. But the news was that\r\nsudden. Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t her girl made a mistake, maybe? Girls were so vague-like\r\nnowadays. She was sure it was most kind of him to give those handsome\r\near-rings. But the thought of him going off so unexpected--middle of\r\nterm, too--with never a why or a but! Well!\r\n\r\nIn some such welter of homely phrase (how foreign to these classic\r\npages!) did Mrs. Batch utter her pain. The Duke answered her tersely but\r\nkindly. He apologised for going so abruptly, and said he would be very\r\nhappy to write for her future use a testimonial to the excellence of\r\nher rooms and of her cooking; and with it he would give her a cheque not\r\nonly for the full term\xe2\x80\x99s rent, and for his board since the beginning of\r\nterm, but also for such board as he would have been likely to have in\r\nthe term\xe2\x80\x99s remainder. He asked her to present her accounts forthwith.\r\n\r\nHe occupied the few minutes of her absence by writing the testimonial.\r\nIt had shaped itself in his mind as a short ode in Doric Greek. But, for\r\nthe benefit of Mrs. Batch, he chose to do a rough equivalent in English.\r\n\r\n\r\n     TO AN UNDERGRADUATE NEEDING\r\n     ROOMS IN OXFORD\r\n\r\n     (A Sonnet in Oxfordshire Dialect)\r\n\r\n     Zeek w\xe2\x80\x99ere thee will in t\xe2\x80\x99Univursity,\r\n     Lad, thee\xe2\x80\x99ll not vind nor bread nor bed that\r\n          matches\r\n     Them as thee\xe2\x80\x99ll vind, roight zure, at Mrs.\r\n          Batch\xe2\x80\x99s...\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not quote the poem in extenso, because, frankly, I think it was one\r\nof his least happily-inspired works. His was not a Muse that could with\r\na good grace doff the grand manner. Also, his command of the Oxfordshire\r\ndialect seems to me based less on study than on conjecture. In fact, I\r\ndo not place the poem higher than among the curiosities of literature.\r\nIt has extrinsic value, however, as illustrating the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthoughtfulness for others in the last hours of his life. And to Mrs.\r\nBatch the MS., framed and glazed in her hall, is an asset beyond price\r\n(witness her recent refusal of Mr. Pierpont Morgan\xe2\x80\x99s sensational bid for\r\nit).\r\n\r\nThis MS. she received together with the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s cheque. The presentation\r\nwas made some twenty minutes after she had laid her accounts before him.\r\n\r\nLavish in giving large sums of his own accord, he was apt to be\r\ncircumspect in the matter of small payments. Such is ever the way of\r\nopulent men. Nor do I see that we have a right to sneer at them for it.\r\nWe cannot deny that their existence is a temptation to us. It is in our\r\nfallen nature to want to get something out of them; and, as we think in\r\nsmall sums (heaven knows), it is of small sums that they are careful.\r\nAbsurd to suppose they really care about halfpence. It must, therefore,\r\nbe about us that they care; and we ought to be grateful to them for the\r\npains they are at to keep us guiltless. I do not suggest that Mrs. Batch\r\nhad at any point overcharged the Duke; but how was he to know that she\r\nhad not done so, except by checking the items, as was his wont? The\r\nreductions that he made, here and there, did not in all amount to\r\nthree-and-sixpence. I do not say they were just. But I do say that his\r\nmotive for making them, and his satisfaction at having made them, were\r\nrather beautiful than otherwise.\r\n\r\nHaving struck an average of Mrs. Batch\xe2\x80\x99s weekly charges, and a similar\r\naverage of his own reductions, he had a basis on which to reckon his\r\nboard for the rest of the term. This amount he added to Mrs. Batch\xe2\x80\x99s\r\namended total, plus the full term\xe2\x80\x99s rent, and accordingly drew a cheque\r\non the local bank where he had an account. Mrs. Batch said she would\r\nbring up a stamped receipt directly; but this the Duke waived,\r\nsaying that the cashed cheque itself would be a sufficient receipt.\r\nAccordingly, he reduced by one penny the amount written on the cheque.\r\nRemembering to initial the correction, he remembered also, with a\r\nmelancholy smile, that to-morrow the cheque would not be negotiable.\r\nHanding it, and the sonnet, to Mrs. Batch, he bade her cash it before\r\nthe bank closed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a glance at his watch, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have\r\nno time to lose. It is a quarter to four.\xe2\x80\x9d Only two hours and a quarter\r\nbefore the final races! How quickly the sands were running out!\r\n\r\nMrs. Batch paused on the threshold, wanted to know if she could \xe2\x80\x9chelp\r\nwith the packing.\xe2\x80\x9d The Duke replied that he was taking nothing with him:\r\nhis various things would be sent for, packed, and removed, within a few\r\ndays. No, he did not want her to order a cab. He was going to walk. And\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Mrs. Batch,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cFor legal reasons with which I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nburden you, you really must cash that cheque at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down in solitude; and there crept over him a mood of deep\r\ndepression... Almost two hours and a quarter before the final races!\r\nWhat on earth should he do in the meantime? He seemed to have done all\r\nthat there was for him to do. His executors would do the rest. He had no\r\nfarewell-letters to write. He had no friends with whom he was on terms\r\nof valediction. There was nothing at all for him to do. He stared\r\nblankly out of the window, at the greyness and blackness of the sky.\r\nWhat a day! What a climate! Why did any sane person live in England? He\r\nfelt positively suicidal.\r\n\r\nHis dully vagrant eye lighted on the bottle of Cold Mixture. He ought to\r\nhave dosed himself a full hour ago. Well, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t care.\r\n\r\nHad Zuleika noticed the bottle? he idly wondered. Probably not. She\r\nwould have made some sprightly reference to it before she went.\r\n\r\nSince there was nothing to do but sit and think, he wished he could\r\nrecapture that mood in which at luncheon he had been able to see Zuleika\r\nas an object for pity. Never, till to-day, had he seen things otherwise\r\nthan they were. Nor had he ever needed to. Never, till last night, had\r\nthere been in his life anything he needed to forget. That woman! As\r\nif it really mattered what she thought of him. He despised himself for\r\nwishing to forget she despised him. But the wish was the measure of the\r\nneed. He eyed the chiffonier. Should he again solicit the grape?\r\n\r\nReluctantly he uncorked the crusted bottle, and filled a glass. Was he\r\ncome to this? He sighed and sipped, quaffed and sighed. The spell of the\r\nold stored sunshine seemed not to work, this time. He could not cease\r\nfrom plucking at the net of ignominies in which his soul lay enmeshed.\r\nWould that he had died yesterday, escaping how much!\r\n\r\nNot for an instant did he flinch from the mere fact of dying to-day.\r\nSince he was not immortal, as he had supposed, it were as well he should\r\ndie now as fifty years hence. Better, indeed. To die \xe2\x80\x9cuntimely,\xe2\x80\x9d as men\r\ncalled it, was the timeliest of all deaths for one who had carved his\r\nyouth to greatness. What perfection could he, Dorset, achieve beyond\r\nwhat was already his? Future years could but stale, if not actually\r\nmar, that perfection. Yes, it was lucky to perish leaving much to the\r\nimagination of posterity. Dear posterity was of a sentimental, not\r\na realistic, habit. She always imagined the dead young hero prancing\r\ngloriously up to the Psalmist\xe2\x80\x99s limit a young hero still; and it was the\r\nsense of her vast loss that kept his memory green. Byron!--he would be\r\nall forgotten to-day if he had lived to be a florid old gentleman with\r\niron-grey whiskers, writing very long, very able letters to \xe2\x80\x9cThe Times\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n about the Repeal of the Corn Laws. Yes, Byron would have been that. It\r\nwas indicated in him. He would have been an old gentleman exacerbated by\r\nQueen Victoria\xe2\x80\x99s invincible prejudice against him, her brusque refusal\r\nto \xe2\x80\x9centertain\xe2\x80\x9d Lord John Russell\xe2\x80\x99s timid nomination of him for a post\r\nin the Government... Shelley would have been a poet to the last. But how\r\ndull, how very dull, would have been the poetry of his middle age!--a\r\ngreat unreadable mass interposed between him and us... Did Byron, mused\r\nthe Duke, know what was to be at Missolonghi? Did he know that he was\r\nto die in service of the Greeks whom he despised? Byron might not have\r\nminded that. But what if the Greeks had told him, in so many words,\r\nthat they despised HIM? How would he have felt then? Would he have been\r\ncontent with his potations of barley-water?... The Duke replenished his\r\nglass, hoping the spell might work yet.... Perhaps, had Byron not been a\r\ndandy--but ah, had he not been in his soul a dandy there would have\r\nbeen no Byron worth mentioning. And it was because he guarded not his\r\ndandyism against this and that irrelevant passion, sexual or political,\r\nthat he cut so annoyingly incomplete a figure. He was absurd in his\r\npolitics, vulgar in his loves. Only in himself, at the times when he\r\nstood haughtily aloof, was he impressive. Nature, fashioning him, had\r\nfashioned also a pedestal for him to stand and brood on, to pose and\r\nsing on. Off that pedestal he was lost.... \xe2\x80\x9cThe idol has come sliding\r\ndown from its pedestal\xe2\x80\x9d--the Duke remembered these words spoken\r\nyesterday by Zuleika. Yes, at the moment when he slid down, he, too, was\r\nlost. For him, master-dandy, the common arena was no place. What had he\r\nto do with love? He was an utter fool at it. Byron had at least had some\r\nfun out of it. What fun had HE had? Last night, he had forgotten to kiss\r\nZuleika when he held her by the wrists. To-day it had been as much as he\r\ncould do to let poor little Katie kiss his hand. Better be vulgar\r\nwith Byron than a noodle with Dorset! he bitterly reflected... Still,\r\nnoodledom was nearer than vulgarity to dandyism. It was a less flagrant\r\nlapse. And he had over Byron this further advantage: his noodledom was\r\nnot a matter of common knowledge; whereas Byron\xe2\x80\x99s vulgarity had ever\r\nneeded to be in the glare of the footlights of Europe. The world\r\nwould say of him that he laid down his life for a woman. Deplorable\r\nsomersault? But nothing evident save this in his whole life was\r\nfaulty... The one other thing that might be carped at--the partisan\r\nspeech he made in the Lords--had exquisitely justified itself by its\r\nresult. For it was as a Knight of the Garter that he had set the perfect\r\nseal on his dandyism. Yes, he reflected, it was on the day when first\r\nhe donned the most grandiose of all costumes, and wore it grandlier\r\nthan ever yet in history had it been worn, than ever would it be worn\r\nhereafter, flaunting the robes with a grace unparalleled and inimitable,\r\nand lending, as it were, to the very insignia a glory beyond their own,\r\nthat he once and for all fulfilled himself, doer of that which he had\r\nbeen sent into the world to do.\r\n\r\nAnd there floated into his mind a desire, vague at first, soon definite,\r\nimperious, irresistible, to see himself once more, before he died,\r\nindued in the fulness of his glory and his might.\r\n\r\nNothing hindered. There was yet a whole hour before he need start for\r\nthe river. His eyes dilated, somewhat as might those of a child about to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdress up\xe2\x80\x9d for a charade; and already, in his impatience, he had undone\r\nhis neck-tie.\r\n\r\nOne after another, he unlocked and threw open the black tin boxes,\r\nsnatching out greedily their great good splendours of crimson and white\r\nand royal blue and gold. You wonder he was not appalled by the task of\r\nessaying unaided a toilet so extensive and so intricate? You wondered\r\neven when you heard that he was wont at Oxford to make without help his\r\ntoilet of every day. Well, the true dandy is always capable of such high\r\nindependence. He is craftsman as well as artist. And, though any unaided\r\nKnight but he with whom we are here concerned would belike have doddered\r\nhopeless in that labyrinth of hooks and buckles which underlies the\r\nvisible glory of a Knight \xe2\x80\x9carraied full and proper,\xe2\x80\x9d Dorset threaded his\r\nway featly and without pause. He had mastered his first excitement. In\r\nhis swiftness was no haste. His procedure had the ease and inevitability\r\nof a natural phenomenon, and was most like to the coming of a rainbow.\r\n\r\nCrimson-doubleted, blue-ribanded, white-trunk-hosed, he stooped to\r\nunderstrap his left knee with that strap of velvet round which\r\nsparkles the proud gay motto of the Order. He affixed to his breast the\r\noctoradiant star, so much larger and more lustrous than any actual star\r\nin heaven. Round his neck he slung that long daedal chain wherefrom St.\r\nGeorge, slaying the Dragon, dangles. He bowed his shoulders to assume\r\nthat vast mantle of blue velvet, so voluminous, so enveloping, that,\r\ndespite the Cross of St. George blazing on it, and the shoulder-knots\r\nlike two great white tropical flowers planted on it, we seem to know\r\nfrom it in what manner of mantle Elijah prophesied. Across his breast\r\nhe knotted this mantle\xe2\x80\x99s two cords of gleaming bullion, one tassel a\r\ndue trifle higher than its fellow. All these things being done, he moved\r\naway from the mirror, and drew on a pair of white kid gloves. Both of\r\nthese being buttoned, he plucked up certain folds of his mantle into the\r\nhollow of his left arm, and with his right hand gave to his left hand\r\nthat ostrich-plumed and heron-plumed hat of black velvet in which a\r\nKnight of the Garter is entitled to take his walks abroad. Then, with\r\nhead erect, and measured tread, he returned to the mirror.\r\n\r\nYou are thinking, I know, of Mr. Sargent\xe2\x80\x99s famous portrait of him.\r\nForget it. Tankerton Hall is open to the public on Wednesdays. Go\r\nthere, and in the dining-hall stand to study well Sir Thomas Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nportrait of the eleventh Duke. Imagine a man some twenty years younger\r\nthan he whom you there behold, but having some such features and some\r\nsuch bearing, and clad in just such robes. Sublimate the dignity of\r\nthat bearing and of those features, and you will then have seen the\r\nfourteenth Duke somewhat as he stood reflected in the mirror of his\r\nroom. Resist your impulse to pass on to the painting which hangs next\r\nbut two to Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s. It deserves, I know, all that you said about it\r\nwhen (at the very time of the events in this chronicle) it was hanging\r\nin Burlington House. Marvellous, I grant you, are those passes of the\r\nswirling brush by which the velvet of the mantle is rendered--passes so\r\nlight and seemingly so fortuitous, yet, seen at the right distance,\r\nso absolute in their power to create an illusion of the actual velvet.\r\nSheen of white satin and silk, glint of gold, glitter of diamonds--never\r\nwere such things caught by surer hand obedient to more voracious eye.\r\nYes, all the splendid surface of everything is there. Yet must you not\r\nlook. The soul is not there. An expensive, very new costume is there,\r\nbut no evocation of the high antique things it stands for; whereas by\r\nthe Duke it was just these things that were evoked to make an aura round\r\nhim, a warm symbolic glow sharpening the outlines of his own\r\nparticular magnificence. Reflecting him, the mirror reflected, in due\r\nsubordination, the history of England. There is nothing of that on Mr.\r\nSargent\xe2\x80\x99s canvas. Obtruded instead is the astounding slickness of Mr.\r\nSargent\xe2\x80\x99s technique: not the sitter, but the painter, is master here.\r\nNay, though I hate to say it, there is in the portrayal of the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattitude and expression a hint of something like mockery--unintentional,\r\nI am sure, but to a sensitive eye discernible. And--but it is clumsy of\r\nme to be reminding you of the very picture I would have you forget.\r\n\r\nLong stood the Duke gazing, immobile. One thing alone ruffled his deep\r\ninward calm. This was the thought that he must presently put off from\r\nhim all his splendour, and be his normal self.\r\n\r\nThe shadow passed from his brow. He would go forth as he was. He would\r\nbe true to the motto he wore, and true to himself. A dandy he had lived.\r\nIn the full pomp and radiance of his dandyism he would die.\r\n\r\nHis soul rose from calm to triumph. A smile lit his face, and he held\r\nhis head higher than ever. He had brought nothing into this world and\r\ncould take nothing out of it? Well, what he loved best he could carry\r\nwith him to the very end; and in death they would not be divided.\r\n\r\nThe smile was still on his face as he passed out from his room. Down\r\nthe stairs he passed, and \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d every stair creaked faintly, \xe2\x80\x9cI ought to\r\nhave been marble!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd it did indeed seem that Mrs. Batch and Katie, who had hurried\r\nout into the hall, were turned to some kind of stone at sight of the\r\ndescending apparition. A moment ago, Mrs. Batch had been hoping she\r\nmight yet at the last speak motherly words. A hopeless mute now! A\r\nmoment ago, Katie\xe2\x80\x99s eyelids had been red with much weeping. Even from\r\nthem the colour suddenly ebbed now. Dead-white her face was between the\r\nblack pearl and the pink. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is the man of whom I dared once for\r\nan instant hope that he loved me!\xe2\x80\x9d--it was thus that the Duke, quite\r\ncorrectly, interpreted her gaze.\r\n\r\nTo her and to her mother he gave an inclusive bow as he swept slowly by.\r\nStone was the matron, and stone the maid.\r\n\r\nStone, too, the Emperors over the way; and the more poignantly thereby\r\nwas the Duke a sight to anguish them, being the very incarnation of what\r\nthemselves had erst been, or tried to be. But in this bitterness they\r\ndid not forget their sorrow at his doom. They were in a mood to forgive\r\nhim the one fault they had ever found in him--his indifference to their\r\nKatie. And now--o mirum mirorum--even this one fault was wiped out.\r\n\r\nFor, stung by memory of a gibe lately cast at him by himself, the Duke\r\nhad paused and, impulsively looking back into the hall, had beckoned\r\nKatie to him; and she had come (she knew not how) to him; and there,\r\nstanding on the doorstep whose whiteness was the symbol of her love,\r\nhe--very lightly, it is true, and on the upmost confines of the brow,\r\nbut quite perceptibly--had kissed her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nAnd now he had passed under the little arch between the eighth and the\r\nninth Emperor, rounded the Sheldonian, and been lost to sight of Katie,\r\nwhom, as he was equally glad and sorry he had kissed her, he was able to\r\ndismiss from his mind.\r\n\r\nIn the quadrangle of the Old Schools he glanced round at the familiar\r\nlabels, blue and gold, over the iron-studded doors,--Schola Theologiae\r\net Antiquae Philosophiae; Museum Arundelianum; Schola Musicae. And\r\nBibliotheca Bodleiana--he paused there, to feel for the last time the\r\nvague thrill he had always felt at sight of the small and devious portal\r\nthat had lured to itself, and would always lure, so many scholars from\r\nthe ends of the earth, scholars famous and scholars obscure, scholars\r\npolyglot and of the most diverse bents, but none of them not stirred in\r\nheart somewhat on the found threshold of the treasure-house. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\ndeep, how perfect, the effect made here by refusal to make any effect\r\nwhatsoever!\xe2\x80\x9d thought the Duke. Perhaps, after all... but no: one could\r\nlay down no general rule. He flung his mantle a little wider from his\r\nbreast, and proceeded into Radcliffe Square.\r\n\r\nAnother farewell look he gave to the old vast horse-chestnut that is\r\ncalled Bishop Heber\xe2\x80\x99s tree. Certainly, no: there was no general rule.\r\nWith its towering and bulging masses of verdure tricked out all over in\r\ntheir annual finery of catkins, Bishop Heber\xe2\x80\x99s tree stood for the very\r\ntype of ingenuous ostentation. And who should dare cavil? who not be\r\ngladdened? Yet awful, more than gladdening, was the effect that the tree\r\nmade to-day. Strangely pale was the verdure against the black sky; and\r\nthe multitudinous catkins had a look almost ghostly. The Duke remembered\r\nthe legend that every one of these fair white spires of blossom is\r\nthe spirit of some dead man who, having loved Oxford much and well, is\r\nsuffered thus to revisit her, for a brief while, year by year. And\r\nit pleased him to doubt not that on one of the topmost branches, next\r\nSpring, his own spirit would be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, look!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a young lady emerging with her brother and her aunt\r\nthrough the gate of Brasenose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Jessie, try to behave yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d hissed her brother.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt Mabel, for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake don\xe2\x80\x99t stare.\xe2\x80\x9d He compelled the pair to\r\nwalk on with him. \xe2\x80\x9cJessie, if you look round over your shoulder...\r\nNo, it is NOT the Vice-Chancellor. It\xe2\x80\x99s Dorset, of Judas--the Duke of\r\nDorset... Why on earth shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he?... No, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t odd in the least...\r\nNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m NOT losing my temper. Only, don\xe2\x80\x99t call me your dear boy... No,\r\nwe will NOT walk slowly so as to let him pass us... Jessie, if you look\r\nround...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor fellow! However fond an undergraduate be of his womenfolk, at\r\nOxford they keep him in a painful state of tension: at any moment they\r\nmay somehow disgrace him. And if throughout the long day he shall have\r\nhad the added strain of guarding them from the knowledge that he is\r\nabout to commit suicide, a certain measure of irritability must be\r\ncondoned.\r\n\r\nPoor Jessie and Aunt Mabel! They were destined to remember that Harold\r\nhad been \xe2\x80\x9cvery peculiar\xe2\x80\x9d all day. They had arrived in the morning, happy\r\nand eager despite the menace of the sky, and--well, they were destined\r\nto reproach themselves for having felt that Harold was \xe2\x80\x9creally rather\r\nimpossible.\xe2\x80\x9d Oh, if he had only confided in them! They could have\r\nreasoned with him, saved him--surely they could have saved him! When he\r\ntold them that the \xe2\x80\x9cFirst Division\xe2\x80\x9d of the races was always very dull,\r\nand that they had much better let him go to it alone,--when he told them\r\nthat it was always very rowdy, and that ladies were not supposed to be\r\nthere--oh, why had they not guessed and clung to him, and kept him away\r\nfrom the river?\r\n\r\nWell, here they were, walking on Harold\xe2\x80\x99s either side, blind to fate,\r\nand only longing to look back at the gorgeous personage behind them.\r\nAunt Mabel had inwardly calculated that the velvet of the mantle alone\r\ncould not have cost less than four guineas a yard. One good look back,\r\nand she would be able to calculate how many yards there were... She\r\nfollowed the example of Lot\xe2\x80\x99s wife; and Jessie followed hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harold. \xe2\x80\x9cThat settles it. I go alone.\xe2\x80\x9d And he was gone\r\nlike an arrow, across the High, down Oriel Street.\r\n\r\nThe two women stood staring ruefully at each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, with a sweep of his plumed hat. \xe2\x80\x9cI observe\r\nyou are stranded; and, if I read your thoughts aright, you are impugning\r\nthe courtesy of that young runagate. Neither of you, I am very sure, is\r\nas one of those ladies who in Imperial Rome took a saucy pleasure in the\r\nspectacle of death. Neither of you can have been warned by your escort\r\nthat you were on the way to see him die, of his own accord, in company\r\nwith many hundreds of other lads, myself included. Therefore, regard his\r\nflight from you as an act not of unkindness, but of tardy compunction.\r\nThe hint you have had from him let me turn into a counsel. Go back, both\r\nof you, to the place whence you came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you SO much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Mabel, with what she took to be great\r\npresence of mind. \xe2\x80\x9cMOST kind of you. We\xe2\x80\x99ll do JUST what you tell us.\r\nCome, Jessie dear,\xe2\x80\x9d and she hurried her niece away with her.\r\n\r\nSomething in her manner of fixing him with her eye had made the Duke\r\nsuspect what was in her mind. Well, she would find out her mistake soon\r\nenough, poor woman. He desired, however, that her mistake should be made\r\nby no one else. He would give no more warnings.\r\n\r\nTragic it was for him, in Merton Street, to see among the crowd\r\nconverging to the meadows so many women, young and old, all imprescient,\r\ntroubled by nothing but the thunder that was in the air, that was on the\r\nbrows of their escorts. He knew not whether it was for their escorts or\r\nfor them that he felt the greater pity; and an added load for his heart\r\nwas the sense of his partial responsibility for what impended. But\r\nhis lips were sealed now. Why should he not enjoy the effect he was\r\ncreating?\r\n\r\nIt was with a measured tread, as yesterday with Zuleika, that he entered\r\nthe avenue of elms. The throng streamed past from behind him, parting\r\nwide, and marvelling as it streamed. Under the pall of this evil evening\r\nhis splendour was the more inspiring. And, just as yesterday no man had\r\nquestioned his right to be with Zuleika, so to-day there was none to\r\ndeem him caparisoned too much. All the men felt at a glance that\r\nhe, coming to meet death thus, did no more than the right homage to\r\nZuleika--aye, and that he made them all partakers in his own glory,\r\ncasting his great mantle over all commorients. Reverence forbade them to\r\ndo more than glance. But the women with them were impelled by wonder to\r\nstare hard, uttering sharp little cries that mingled with the cawing of\r\nthe rooks overhead. Thus did scores of men find themselves shamed like\r\nour friend Harold. But this, you say, was no more than a just return for\r\ntheir behaviour yesterday, when, in this very avenue, so many women were\r\nalmost crushed to death by them in their insensate eagerness to see Miss\r\nDobson.\r\n\r\nTo-day by scores of women it was calculated not only that the velvet of\r\nthe Duke\xe2\x80\x99s mantle could not have cost less than four guineas a yard, but\r\nalso that there must be quite twenty-five yards of it. Some of the fair\r\nmathematicians had, in the course of the past fortnight, visited the\r\nRoyal Academy and seen there Mr. Sargent\xe2\x80\x99s portrait of the wearer, so\r\nthat their estimate now was but the endorsement of an estimate already\r\nmade. Yet their impression of the Duke was above all a spiritual one.\r\nThe nobility of his face and bearing was what most thrilled them as they\r\nwent by; and those of them who had heard the rumour that he was in love\r\nwith that frightfully flashy-looking creature, Zuleika Dobson, were more\r\nthan ever sure there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a word of truth in it.\r\n\r\nAs he neared the end of the avenue, the Duke was conscious of a thinning\r\nin the procession on either side of him, and anon he was aware that not\r\none undergraduate was therein. And he knew at once--did not need to look\r\nback to know--why this was. SHE was coming.\r\n\r\nYes, she had come into the avenue, her magnetism speeding before her,\r\ninsomuch that all along the way the men immediately ahead of her looked\r\nround, beheld her, stood aside for her. With her walked The MacQuern,\r\nand a little bodyguard of other blest acquaintances; and behind her\r\nswayed the dense mass of the disorganised procession. And now the last\r\nrank between her and the Duke was broken, and at the revealed vision\r\nof him she faltered midway in some raillery she was addressing to The\r\nMacQuern. Her eyes were fixed, her lips were parted, her tread had\r\nbecome stealthy. With a brusque gesture of dismissal to the men beside\r\nher, she darted forward, and lightly overtook the Duke just as he was\r\nturning towards the barges.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, smiling round into his face.\r\n\r\nHis shoulder-knots just perceptibly rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t a policeman in sight, John. You\xe2\x80\x99re at my mercy. No, no;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m at yours. Tolerate me. You really do look quite wonderful. There, I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be so impertinent as to praise you. Only let me be with you. Will\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shoulder-knots repeated their answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t listen to me; needn\xe2\x80\x99t look at me--unless you care to use my\r\neyes as mirrors. Only let me be seen with you. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I want. Not\r\nthat your society isn\xe2\x80\x99t a boon in itself, John. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been so bored\r\nsince I left you. The MacQuern is too, too dull, and so are his friends.\r\nOh, that meal with them in Balliol! As soon as I grew used to the\r\nthought that they were going to die for me, I simply couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand\r\nthem. Poor boys! it was as much as I could do not to tell them I wished\r\nthem dead already. Indeed, when they brought me down for the first\r\nraces, I did suggest that they might as well die now as later. Only they\r\nlooked very solemn and said it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly be done till after the\r\nfinal races. And oh, the tea with them! What have YOU been doing all the\r\nafternoon? Oh John, after THEM, I could almost love you again. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\none fall in love with a man\xe2\x80\x99s clothes? To think that all those splendid\r\nthings you have on are going to be spoilt--all for me. Nominally for\r\nme, that is. It is very wonderful, John. I do appreciate it, really and\r\ntruly, though I know you think I don\xe2\x80\x99t. John, if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t mere spite\r\nyou feel for me--but it\xe2\x80\x99s no good talking about that. Come, let us be as\r\ncheerful as we may be. Is this the Judas house-boat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Judas barge,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, irritated by a mistake which but\r\nyesterday had rather charmed him.\r\n\r\nAs he followed his companion across the plank, there came dully from the\r\nhills the first low growl of the pent storm. The sound struck for him a\r\nstrange contrast with the prattle he had perforce been listening to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThunder,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zuleika over her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvidently,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\nHalf-way up the stairs to the roof, she looked round. \xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\ncoming?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, and pointed to the raft in front of the barge. She\r\nquickly descended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cmy gesture was not a summons. The raft is for\r\nmen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want to do on it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo wait there till the races are over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut--what do you mean? Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you coming up on to the roof at all?\r\nYesterday--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I see,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, unable to repress a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cBut to-day I am\r\nnot dressed for a flying-leap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZuleika put a finger to her lips. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk so loud. Those women up\r\nthere will hear you. No one must ever know I knew what was going to\r\nhappen. What evidence should I have that I tried to prevent it? Only my\r\nown unsupported word--and the world is always against a woman. So do be\r\ncareful. I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought it all out. The whole thing must be SPRUNG on me.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t look so horribly cynical... What was I saying? Oh yes; well, it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter. I had it fixed in my mind that you--but no, of\r\ncourse, in that mantle you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. But why not come up on the roof\r\nwith me meanwhile, and then afterwards make some excuse and--\xe2\x80\x9d The rest\r\nof her whisper was lost in another growl of thunder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather make my excuses forthwith,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, as the\r\nraces must be almost due now, I advise you to go straight up and secure\r\na place against the railing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will look very odd, my going all alone into a crowd of people whom I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99m an unmarried girl. I do think you might--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke.\r\n\r\nAgain Zuleika raised a warning finger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, John,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cSee, I am still wearing your studs.\r\nGood-bye. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to call my name in a loud voice. You promised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cremember this. I have loved but twice\r\nin my life; and none but you have I loved. This, too: if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nforced me to kill my love, I would have died with you. And you know it\r\nis true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d It was true enough.\r\n\r\nCourteously he watched her up the stairs.\r\n\r\nAs she reached the roof, she cried down to him from the throng, \xe2\x80\x9cThen\r\nyou will wait down there to take me home afterwards?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bowed silently.\r\n\r\nThe raft was even more crowded than yesterday, but way was made for him\r\nby Judasians past and present. He took his place in the centre of the\r\nfront row.\r\n\r\nAt his feet flowed the fateful river. From the various barges the last\r\npunt-loads had been ferried across to the towing-path, and the last\r\nof the men who were to follow the boats in their course had vanished\r\ntowards the starting-point. There remained, however, a fringe of lesser\r\nenthusiasts. Their figures stood outlined sharply in that strange dark\r\nclearness which immediately precedes a storm.\r\n\r\nThe thunder rumbled around the hills, and now and again there was a\r\nfaint glare on the horizon.\r\n\r\nWould Judas bump Magdalen? Opinion on the raft seemed to be divided. But\r\nthe sanguine spirits were in a majority.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were making a book on the event,\xe2\x80\x9d said a middle-aged clergyman,\r\nwith that air of breezy emancipation which is so distressing to the\r\nlaity, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d bet two to one we bump.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou demean your cloth, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d the Duke would have said, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout\r\ncheating its disabilities,\xe2\x80\x9d had not his mouth been stopped by a loud and\r\nprolonged thunder-clap.\r\n\r\nIn the hush thereafter, came the puny sound of a gunshot. The boats were\r\nstarting. Would Judas bump Magdalen? Would Judas be head of the river?\r\n\r\nStrange, thought the Duke, that for him, standing as he did on the peak\r\nof dandyism, on the brink of eternity, this trivial question of boats\r\ncould have importance. And yet, and yet, for this it was that his heart\r\nwas beating. A few minutes hence, an end to victors and vanquished\r\nalike; and yet...\r\n\r\nA sudden white vertical streak slid down the sky. Then there was\r\na consonance to split the drums of the world\xe2\x80\x99s ears, followed by\r\na horrific rattling as of actual artillery--tens of thousands of\r\ngun-carriages simultaneously at the gallop, colliding, crashing, heeling\r\nover in the blackness.\r\n\r\nThen, and yet more awful, silence; the little earth cowering voiceless\r\nunder the heavens\xe2\x80\x99 menace. And, audible in the hush now, a faint sound;\r\nthe sound of the runners on the towing-path cheering the crews forward,\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nAnd there was another faint sound that came to the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s ears. It he\r\nunderstood when, a moment later, he saw the surface of the river alive\r\nwith infinitesimal fountains.\r\n\r\nRain!\r\n\r\nHis very mantle was aspersed. In another minute he would stand sodden,\r\ninglorious, a mock. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cZuleika!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried in a loud voice. Then he took a deep breath, and,\r\nburying his face in his mantle, plunged.\r\n\r\nFull on the river lay the mantle outspread. Then it, too, went under. A\r\ngreat roll of water marked the spot. The plumed hat floated.\r\n\r\nThere was a confusion of shouts from the raft, of screams from the roof.\r\nMany youths--all the youths there--cried \xe2\x80\x9cZuleika!\xe2\x80\x9d and leapt emulously\r\nheadlong into the water. \xe2\x80\x9cBrave fellows!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the elder men,\r\nsupposing rescue-work. The rain pelted, the thunder pealed. Here and\r\nthere was a glimpse of a young head above water--for an instant only.\r\n\r\nShouts and screams now from the infected barges on either side. A score\r\nof fresh plunges. \xe2\x80\x9cSplendid fellows!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, what of the Duke? I am glad to say that he was alive and (but\r\nfor the cold he had caught last night) well. Indeed, his mind had never\r\nworked more clearly than in this swift dim underworld. His mantle, the\r\ncords of it having come untied, had drifted off him, leaving his arms\r\nfree. With breath well-pent, he steadily swam, scarcely less amused than\r\nannoyed that the gods had, after all, dictated the exact time at which\r\nhe should seek death.\r\n\r\nI am loth to interrupt my narrative at this rather exciting moment--a\r\nmoment when the quick, tense style, exemplified in the last paragraph\r\nbut one, is so very desirable. But in justice to the gods I must pause\r\nto put in a word of excuse for them. They had imagined that it was\r\nin mere irony that the Duke had said he could not die till after the\r\nbumping-races; and not until it seemed that he stood ready to make an\r\nend of himself had the signal been given by Zeus for the rain to fall.\r\nOne is taught to refrain from irony, because mankind does tend to take\r\nit literally. In the hearing of the gods, who hear all, it is conversely\r\nunsafe to make a simple and direct statement. So what is one to do? The\r\ndilemma needs a whole volume to itself.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the Duke. He had now been under water for a full\r\nminute, swimming down stream; and he calculated that he had yet another\r\nfull minute of consciousness. Already the whole of his past life\r\nhad vividly presented itself to him--myriads of tiny incidents, long\r\nforgotten, now standing out sharply in their due sequence. He had\r\nmastered this conspectus in a flash of time, and was already tired of\r\nit. How smooth and yielding were the weeds against his face! He wondered\r\nif Mrs. Batch had been in time to cash the cheque. If not, of course his\r\nexecutors would pay the amount, but there would be delays, long delays,\r\nMrs. Batch in meshes of red tape. Red tape for her, green weeds for\r\nhim--he smiled at this poor conceit, classifying it as a fair sample of\r\nmerman\xe2\x80\x99s wit. He swam on through the quiet cool darkness, less quickly\r\nnow. Not many more strokes now, he told himself; a few, only a few; then\r\nsleep. How was he come here? Some woman had sent him. Ever so many years\r\nago, some woman. He forgave her. There was nothing to forgive her. It\r\nwas the gods who had sent him--too soon, too soon. He let his arms rise\r\nin the water, and he floated up. There was air in that over-world, and\r\nsomething he needed to know there before he came down again to sleep.\r\n\r\nHe gasped the air into his lungs, and he remembered what it was that he\r\nneeded to know.\r\n\r\nHad he risen in mid-stream, the keel of the Magdalen boat might have\r\nkilled him. The oars of Magdalen did all but graze his face. The eyes of\r\nthe Magdalen cox met his. The cords of the Magdalen rudder slipped from\r\nthe hands that held them; whereupon the Magdalen man who rowed \xe2\x80\x9cbow\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n missed his stroke.\r\n\r\nAn instant later, just where the line of barges begins, Judas had bumped\r\nMagdalen.\r\n\r\nA crash of thunder deadened the din of the stamping and dancing crowd on\r\nthe towing-path. The rain was a deluge making land and water as one.\r\n\r\nAnd the conquered crew, and the conquering, both now had seen the face\r\nof the Duke. A white smiling face, anon it was gone. Dorset was gone\r\ndown to his last sleep.\r\n\r\nVictory and defeat alike forgotten, the crews staggered erect and flung\r\nthemselves into the river, the slender boats capsizing and spinning\r\nfutile around in a melley of oars.\r\n\r\nFrom the towing-path--no more din there now, but great single cries\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cZuleika!\xe2\x80\x9d--leapt figures innumerable through rain to river. The\r\narrested boats of the other crews drifted zigzag hither and thither. The\r\ndropped oars rocked and clashed, sank and rebounded, as the men plunged\r\nacross them into the swirling stream.\r\n\r\nAnd over all this confusion and concussion of men and man-made things\r\ncrashed the vaster discords of the heavens; and the waters of the\r\nheavens fell ever denser and denser, as though to the aid of waters that\r\ncould not in themselves envelop so many hundreds of struggling human\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nAll along the soaked towing-path lay strewn the horns, the rattles, the\r\nmotor-hooters, that the youths had flung aside before they leapt. Here\r\nand there among these relics stood dazed elder men, staring through the\r\nstorm. There was one of them--a grey-beard--who stripped off his blazer,\r\nplunged, grabbed at some live man, grappled him, was dragged under. He\r\ncame up again further along stream, swam choking to the bank, clung to\r\nthe grasses. He whimpered as he sought foot-hold in the slime. It was\r\nill to be down in that abominable sink of death.\r\n\r\nAbominable, yes, to them who discerned there death only; but sacramental\r\nand sweet enough to the men who were dying there for love. Any face that\r\nrose was smiling.\r\n\r\nThe thunder receded; the rain was less vehement: the boats and the oars\r\nhad drifted against the banks. And always the patient river bore its\r\nawful burden towards Iffley.\r\n\r\nAs on the towing-path, so on the youth-bereft rafts of the barges,\r\nyonder, stood many stupefied elders, staring at the river, staring back\r\nfrom the river into one another\xe2\x80\x99s faces.\r\n\r\nDispeopled now were the roofs of the barges. Under the first drops of\r\nthe rain most of the women had come huddling down for shelter inside;\r\npanic had presently driven down the rest. Yet on one roof one woman\r\nstill was. A strange, drenched figure, she stood bright-eyed in the\r\ndimness; alone, as it was well she should be in her great hour; draining\r\nthe lees of such homage as had come to no woman in history recorded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nArtistically, there is a good deal to be said for that old Greek friend\r\nof ours, the Messenger; and I dare say you blame me for having, as it\r\nwere, made you an eye-witness of the death of the undergraduates, when\r\nI might so easily have brought some one in to tell you about it after\r\nit was all over... Some one? Whom? Are you not begging the question?\r\nI admit there were, that evening in Oxford, many people who, when they\r\nwent home from the river, gave vivid reports of what they had seen. But\r\namong them was none who had seen more than a small portion of the whole\r\naffair. Certainly, I might have pieced together a dozen of the various\r\naccounts, and put them all into the mouth of one person. But credibility\r\nis not enough for Clio\xe2\x80\x99s servant. I aim at truth. And so, as I by my\r\nZeus-given incorporeity was the one person who had a good view of the\r\nscene at large, you must pardon me for having withheld the veil of\r\nindirect narration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo late,\xe2\x80\x9d you will say if I offer you a Messenger now. But it was not\r\nthus that Mrs. Batch and Katie greeted Clarence when, lamentably soaked\r\nwith rain, that Messenger appeared on the threshold of the kitchen.\r\nKatie was laying the table-cloth for seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock supper. Neither she\r\nnor her mother was clairvoyante. Neither of them knew what had been\r\nhappening. But, as Clarence had not come home since afternoon-school,\r\nthey had assumed that he was at the river; and they now assumed from the\r\nlook of him that something very unusual had been happening there. As to\r\nwhat this was, they were not quickly enlightened. Our old Greek friend,\r\nafter a run of twenty miles, would always reel off a round hundred of\r\ngraphic verses unimpeachable in scansion. Clarence was of degenerate\r\nmould. He collapsed on to a chair, and sat there gasping; and his\r\nrecovery was rather delayed than hastened by his mother, who, in her\r\nsolicitude, patted him vigorously between the shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him alone, mother, do,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Katie, wringing her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Duke, he\xe2\x80\x99s drowned himself,\xe2\x80\x9d presently gasped the Messenger.\r\n\r\nBlank verse, yes, so far as it went; but delivered without the slightest\r\nregard for rhythm, and composed in stark defiance of those laws which\r\nshould regulate the breaking of bad news. You, please remember, were\r\ncarefully prepared by me against the shock of the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s death; and yet\r\nI hear you still mumbling that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t let the actual fact be told you\r\nby a Messenger. Come, do you really think your grievance against me\r\nis for a moment comparable with that of Mrs. and Miss Batch against\r\nClarence? Did you feel faint at any moment in the foregoing chapter? No.\r\nBut Katie, at Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s first words, fainted outright. Think a little\r\nmore about this poor girl senseless on the floor, and a little less\r\nabout your own paltry discomfort.\r\n\r\nMrs. Batch herself did not faint, but she was too much overwhelmed to\r\nnotice that her daughter had done so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! Mercy on us! Speak, boy, can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe river,\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Clarence. \xe2\x80\x9cThrew himself in. On purpose. I was on\r\nthe towing-path. Saw him do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Batch gave a low moan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKatie\xe2\x80\x99s fainted,\xe2\x80\x9d added the Messenger, not without a touch of personal\r\npride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaw him do it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Batch repeated dully. \xe2\x80\x9cKatie,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in the\r\nsame voice, \xe2\x80\x9cget up this instant.\xe2\x80\x9d But Katie did not hear her.\r\n\r\nThe mother was loth to have been outdone in sensibility by the daughter,\r\nand it was with some temper that she hastened to make the necessary\r\nministrations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere am I?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Katie, at length, echoing the words used in this\r\nvery house, at a similar juncture, on this very day, by another lover of\r\nthe Duke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you may well ask that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Batch, with more force than\r\nreason. \xe2\x80\x9cA mother\xe2\x80\x99s support indeed! Well! And as for you,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried,\r\nturning on Clarence, \xe2\x80\x9csending her off like that with your--\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nwas face to face again with the tragic news. Katie, remembering it\r\nsimultaneously, uttered a loud sob. Mrs. Batch capped this with a much\r\nlouder one. Clarence stood before the fire, slowly revolving on one\r\nheel. His clothes steamed briskly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Katie. She rose and came uncertainly towards her\r\nbrother, half threatening, half imploring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, strong in his advantage. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I shan\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\neither of you anything more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Batch through her tears called Katie a bad girl, and Clarence a bad\r\nboy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you get THEM?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Clarence, pointing to the ear-rings worn\r\nby his sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHE gave me them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Katie. Clarence curbed the brotherly intention\r\nof telling her she looked \xe2\x80\x9ca sight\xe2\x80\x9d in them.\r\n\r\nShe stood staring into vacancy. \xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t love HER,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was all over. I\xe2\x80\x99ll vow he didn\xe2\x80\x99t love HER.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho d\xe2\x80\x99you mean by her?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Clarence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat Miss Dobson that\xe2\x80\x99s been here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s her other name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cZuleika,\xe2\x80\x9d Katie enunciated with bitterest abhorrence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, he jolly well did love her. That\xe2\x80\x99s the name he called out\r\njust before he threw himself in. \xe2\x80\x98Zuleika!\xe2\x80\x99--like that,\xe2\x80\x9d added the boy,\r\nwith a most infelicitous attempt to reproduce the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s manner.\r\n\r\nKatie had shut her eyes, and clenched her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe hated her. He told me so,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was always a mother to him,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Mrs. Batch, rocking to and fro on\r\na chair in a corner. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t he come to me in his trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe kissed me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Katie, as in a trance. \xe2\x80\x9cNo other man shall ever do\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Clarence. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you let him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wretched little whipper-snapper!\xe2\x80\x9d flashed Katie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am, am I?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Clarence, squaring up to his sister. \xe2\x80\x9cSay that\r\nagain, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that Katie would have said it again, had not her\r\nmother closed the scene with a prolonged wail of censure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to be thinking of ME, you wicked girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Batch.\r\nKatie went across, and laid a gentle hand on her mother\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\nThis, however, did but evoke a fresh flood of tears. Mrs. Batch had a\r\nkeen sense of the deportment owed to tragedy. Katie, by bickering with\r\nClarence, had thrown away the advantage she had gained by fainting. Mrs.\r\nBatch was not going to let her retrieve it by shining as a consoler.\r\nI hasten to add that this resolve was only sub-conscious in the good\r\nwoman. Her grief was perfectly sincere. And it was not the less so\r\nbecause with it was mingled a certain joy in the greatness of the\r\ncalamity. She came of good sound peasant stock. Abiding in her was the\r\nspirit of those old songs and ballads in which daisies and daffodillies\r\nand lovers\xe2\x80\x99 vows and smiles are so strangely inwoven with tombs and\r\nghosts, with murders and all manner of grim things. She had not had\r\neducation enough to spoil her nerve. She was able to take the rough with\r\nthe smooth. She was able to take all life for her province, and death\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nThe Duke was dead. This was the stupendous outline she had grasped: now\r\nlet it be filled in. She had been stricken: now let her be racked. Soon\r\nafter her daughter had moved away, Mrs. Batch dried her eyes, and bade\r\nClarence tell just what had happened. She did not flinch. Modern Katie\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nSuch had ever been the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s magic in the household that Clarence\r\nhad at first forgotten to mention that any one else was dead. Of\r\nthis omission he was glad. It promised him a new lease of importance.\r\nMeanwhile, he described in greater detail the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s plunge. Mrs.\r\nBatch\xe2\x80\x99s mind, while she listened, ran ahead, dog-like, into the\r\nimmediate future, ranging around: \xe2\x80\x9cthe family\xe2\x80\x9d would all be here\r\nto-morrow, the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s own room must be \xe2\x80\x9cput straight\xe2\x80\x9d to-night, \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\nof speaking\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\nKatie\xe2\x80\x99s mind harked back to the immediate past--to the tone of that\r\nvoice, to that hand which she had kissed, to the touch of those lips on\r\nher brow, to the door-step she had made so white for him, day by day...\r\n\r\nThe sound of the rain had long ceased. There was the noise of a\r\ngathering wind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen in went a lot of others,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they all\r\nshouted out \xe2\x80\x98Zuleika!\xe2\x80\x99 just like he did. Then a lot more went in.\r\nFirst I thought it was some sort of fun. Not it!\xe2\x80\x9d And he told how,\r\nby inquiries further down the river, he had learned the extent of the\r\ndisaster. \xe2\x80\x9cHundreds and hundreds of them--ALL of them,\xe2\x80\x9d he summed up.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all for the love of HER,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, as with a sulky salute to\r\nRomance.\r\n\r\nMrs. Batch had risen from her chair, the better to cope with such\r\nmagnitude. She stood with wide-spread arms, silent, gaping. She seemed,\r\nby sheer force of sympathy, to be expanding to the dimensions of a\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\nIntensive Katie recked little of all these other deaths. \xe2\x80\x9cI only know,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he hated her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHundreds and hundreds--ALL,\xe2\x80\x9d intoned Mrs. Batch, then gave a sudden\r\nstart, as having remembered something. Mr. Noaks! He, too! She staggered\r\nto the door, leaving her actual offspring to their own devices, and went\r\nheavily up the stairs, her mind scampering again before her.... If he\r\nwas safe and sound, dear young gentleman, heaven be praised! and she\r\nwould break the awful news to him, very gradually. If not, there was\r\nanother \xe2\x80\x9cfamily\xe2\x80\x9d to be solaced; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a mother myself, Mrs. Noaks\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\nThe sitting-room door was closed. Twice did Mrs. Batch tap on the panel,\r\nreceiving no answer. She went in, gazed around in the dimness, sighed\r\ndeeply, and struck a match. Conspicuous on the table lay a piece of\r\npaper. She bent to examine it. A piece of lined paper, torn from an\r\nexercise book, it was neatly inscribed with the words \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is Life\r\nwithout Love?\xe2\x80\x9d The final word and the note of interrogation were\r\nsomewhat blurred, as by a tear. The match had burnt itself out. The\r\nlandlady lit another, and read the legend a second time, that she might\r\ntake in the full pathos of it. Then she sat down in the arm-chair. For\r\nsome minutes she wept there. Then, having no more, tears, she went out\r\non tip-toe, closing the door very quietly.\r\n\r\nAs she descended the last flight of stairs, her daughter had just shut\r\nthe front-door, and was coming along the hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Mr. Noaks--he\xe2\x80\x99s gone,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Katie listlessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes he has, you heartless girl. What\xe2\x80\x99s that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got in your hand?\r\nWhy, if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t the black-leading! And what have you been doing with\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me alone, mother, do,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Katie. She had done her lowly\r\ntask. She had expressed her mourning, as best she could, there where she\r\nhad been wont to express her love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nAnd Zuleika? She had done a wise thing, and was where it was best that\r\nshe should be.\r\n\r\nHer face lay upturned on the water\xe2\x80\x99s surface, and round it were the\r\nmasses of her dark hair, half floating, half submerged. Her eyes were\r\nclosed, and her lips were parted. Not Ophelia in the brook could have\r\nseemed more at peace.\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x9cLike a creature native and indued\r\n     Unto that element,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n tranquil Zuleika lay.\r\n\r\nGently to and fro her tresses drifted on the water, or under the water\r\nwent ever ravelling and unravelling. Nothing else of her stirred.\r\n\r\nWhat to her now the loves that she had inspired and played on? the lives\r\nlost for her? Little thought had she now of them. Aloof she lay.\r\n\r\nSteadily rising from the water was a thick vapour that turned to dew on\r\nthe window-pane. The air was heavy with scent of violets. These are the\r\nflowers of mourning; but their scent here and now signified nothing; for\r\nEau de Violettes was the bath-essence that Zuleika always had.\r\n\r\nThe bath-room was not of the white-gleaming kind to which she was\r\naccustomed. The walls were papered, not tiled, and the bath itself was\r\nof japanned tin, framed in mahogany. These things, on the evening of\r\nher arrival at the Warden\xe2\x80\x99s, had rather distressed her. But she was the\r\nbetter able to bear them because of that well-remembered past when a\r\nbath-room was in itself a luxury pined for--days when a not-large and\r\nnot-full can of not-hot water, slammed down at her bedroom door by a\r\ngoverness-resenting housemaid, was as much as the gods allowed her. And\r\nthere was, to dulcify for her the bath of this evening, the yet sharper\r\ncontrast with the plight she had just come home in, sopped, shivering,\r\nclung to by her clothes. Because this bath was not a mere luxury, but a\r\nnecessary precaution, a sure means of salvation from chill, she did the\r\nmore gratefully bask in it, till Melisande came back to her, laden with\r\nwarmed towels.\r\n\r\nA few minutes before eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock she was fully ready to go down to\r\ndinner, with even more than the usual glow of health, and hungry beyond\r\nher wont.\r\n\r\nYet, as she went down, her heart somewhat misgave her. Indeed, by force\r\nof the wide experience she had had as a governess, she never did feel\r\nquite at her ease when she was staying in a private house: the fear of\r\nnot giving satisfaction haunted her; she was always on her guard; the\r\nshadow of dismissal absurdly hovered. And to-night she could not tell\r\nherself, as she usually did, not to be so silly. If her grandfather knew\r\nalready the motive by which those young men had been actuated, dinner\r\nwith him might be a rather strained affair. He might tell her, in so\r\nmany words, that he wished he had not invited her to Oxford.\r\n\r\nThrough the open door of the drawing room she saw him, standing\r\nmajestic, draped in a voluminous black gown. Her instinct was to run\r\naway; but this she conquered. She went straight in, remembering not to\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Warden, shaking a forefinger at her with old-world\r\nplayfulness. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what have you to say for yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRelieved, she was also a trifle shocked. Was it possible that he, a\r\nresponsible old man, could take things so lightly?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, grand-papa,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, hanging her head, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat CAN I say? It\r\nis--it is too, too, dreadful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there, my dear. I was but jesting. If you have had an agreeable\r\ntime, you are forgiven for playing truant. Where have you been all day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe saw that she had misjudged him. \xe2\x80\x9cI have just come from the river,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes? And did the College make its fourth bump to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, grand-papa. There was so much happening. It--I will\r\ntell you all about it at dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, indicating his gown, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot be with you.\r\nThe bump-supper, you know. I have to preside in Hall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZuleika had forgotten there was to be a bump-supper, and, though she\r\nwas not very sure what a bump-supper was, she felt it would be a mockery\r\nto-night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut grand-papa--\xe2\x80\x9d she began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, I cannot dissociate myself from the life of the College. And,\r\nalas,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking at the clock, \xe2\x80\x9cI must leave you now. As soon as\r\nyou have finished dinner, you might, if you would care to, come and peep\r\ndown at us from the gallery. There is apt to be some measure of\r\nnoise and racket, but all of it good-humoured and--boys will be\r\nboys--pardonable. Will you come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, grand-papa,\xe2\x80\x9d she said awkwardly. Left alone, she hardly knew\r\nwhether to laugh or cry. In a moment, the butler came to her rescue,\r\ntelling her that dinner was served.\r\n\r\nAs the figure of the Warden emerged from Salt Cellar into the Front\r\nQuadrangle, a hush fell on the group of gowned Fellows outside the Hall.\r\nMost of them had only just been told the news, and (such is the force\r\nof routine in an University) were still sceptical of it. And in face of\r\nthese doubts the three or four dons who had been down at the river were\r\nnow half ready to believe that there must, after all, be some mistake,\r\nand that in this world of illusions they had to-night been specially\r\ntricked. To rebut this theory, there was the notable absence of\r\nundergraduates. Or was this an illusion, too? Men of thought, agile on\r\nthe plane of ideas, devils of fellows among books, they groped feebly\r\nin this matter of actual life and death. The sight of their Warden\r\nheartened them. After all, he was the responsible person. He was father\r\nof the flock that had strayed, and grandfather of the beautiful Miss\r\nZuleika.\r\n\r\nLike her, they remembered not to smile in greeting him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe storm seems to have passed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a murmur of \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Warden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how did our boat acquit itself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a shuffling pause. Every one looked at the Sub-Warden: it was\r\nmanifestly for him to break the news, or to report the hallucination. He\r\nwas nudged forward--a large man, with a large beard at which he plucked\r\nnervously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, really, Warden,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe--we hardly know,\xe2\x80\x9d * and he ended\r\nwith what can only be described as a giggle. He fell low in the esteem\r\nof his fellows.\r\n\r\n\r\n   *Those of my readers who are interested in athletic sports will\r\n    remember the long controversy that raged as to whether Judas had\r\n    actually bumped Magdalen; and they will not need to be minded that\r\n    it was mainly through the evidence of Mr. E. T. A. Cook, who had\r\n    been on the towing-path at the time, that the O. U. B. C. decided\r\n    the point in Judas\xe2\x80\x99 favour, and fixed the order of the boats for\r\n    the following year accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\nThinking of that past Sub-Warden whose fame was linked with the\r\nsun-dial, the Warden eyed this one keenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d he presently said, \xe2\x80\x9cour young men seem to be already\r\nat table. Shall we follow their example?\xe2\x80\x9d And he led the way up the\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\nAlready at table? The dons\xe2\x80\x99 dubiety toyed with this hypothesis. But the\r\naspect of the Hall\xe2\x80\x99s interior was hard to explain away. Here were the\r\nthree long tables, stretching white towards the dais, and laden with the\r\nusual crockery and cutlery, and with pots of flowers in honour of the\r\noccasion. And here, ranged along either wall, was the usual array of\r\nscouts, motionless, with napkins across their arms. But that was all.\r\n\r\nIt became clear to the Warden that some organised prank or protest was\r\nafoot. Dignity required that he should take no heed whatsoever. Looking\r\nneither to the right nor to the left, stately he approached the dais,\r\nhis Fellows to heel.\r\n\r\nIn Judas, as in other Colleges, grace before meat is read by the Senior\r\nScholar. The Judas grace (composed, they say, by Christopher Whitrid\r\nhimself) is noted for its length and for the excellence of its Latinity.\r\nWho was to read it to-night? The Warden, having searched his mind vainly\r\nfor a precedent, was driven to create one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Junior Fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwill read grace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlushing to the roots of his hair, and with crablike gait, Mr. Pedby,\r\nthe Junior Fellow, went and unhooked from the wall that little shield\r\nof wood on which the words of the grace are carven. Mr. Pedby was--Mr.\r\nPedby is--a mathematician. His treatise on the Higher Theory of Short\r\nDivision by Decimals had already won for him an European reputation.\r\nJudas was--Judas is--proud of Pedby. Nor is it denied that in\r\nundertaking the duty thrust on him he quickly controlled his nerves and\r\nread the Latin out in ringing accents. Better for him had he not done\r\nso. The false quantities he made were so excruciating and so many that,\r\nwhile the very scouts exchanged glances, the dons at the high table lost\r\nall command of their features, and made horrible noises in the effort to\r\ncontain themselves. The very Warden dared not look from his plate.\r\n\r\nIn every breast around the high table, behind every shirt-front or\r\nblack silk waistcoat, glowed the recognition of a new birth. Suddenly,\r\nunheralded, a thing of highest destiny had fallen into their academic\r\nmidst. The stock of Common Room talk had to-night been re-inforced and\r\nenriched for all time. Summers and winters would come and go, old faces\r\nwould vanish, giving place to new, but the story of Pedby\xe2\x80\x99s grace would\r\nbe told always. Here was a tradition that generations of dons yet unborn\r\nwould cherish and chuckle over. Something akin to awe mingled itself\r\nwith the subsiding merriment. And the dons, having finished their soup,\r\nsipped in silence the dry brown sherry.\r\n\r\nThose who sat opposite to the Warden, with their backs to the void,\r\nwere oblivious of the matter that had so recently teased them. They\r\nwere conscious only of an agreeable hush, in which they peered down\r\nthe vistas of the future, watching the tradition of Pedby\xe2\x80\x99s grace as it\r\nrolled brighter and ever brighter down to eternity.\r\n\r\nThe pop of a champagne cork startled them to remembrance that this was a\r\nbump-supper, and a bump-supper of a peculiar kind. The turbot that\r\ncame after the soup, the champagne that succeeded the sherry, helped to\r\nquicken in these men of thought the power to grapple with a reality. The\r\naforesaid three or four who had been down at the river recovered their\r\nlost belief in the evidence of their eyes and ears. In the rest was a\r\nspirit of receptivity which, as the meal went on, mounted to conviction.\r\nThe Sub-Warden made a second and more determined attempt to enlighten\r\nthe Warden; but the Warden\xe2\x80\x99s eye met his with a suspicion so cruelly\r\npointed that he again floundered and gave in.\r\n\r\nAll adown those empty other tables gleamed the undisturbed cutlery, and\r\nthe flowers in the pots innocently bloomed. And all adown either wall,\r\nunneeded but undisbanded, the scouts remained. Some of the elder ones\r\nstood with closed eyes and heads sunk forward, now and again jerking\r\nthemselves erect, and blinking around, wondering, remembering.\r\n\r\nAnd for a while this scene was looked down on by a not disinterested\r\nstranger. For a while, her chin propped on her hands, Zuleika leaned\r\nover the rail of the gallery, just as she had lately leaned over the\r\nbarge\xe2\x80\x99s rail, staring down and along. But there was no spark of triumph\r\nnow in her eyes; only a deep melancholy; and in her mouth a taste as of\r\ndust and ashes. She thought of last night, and of all the buoyant life\r\nthat this Hall had held. Of the Duke she thought, and of the whole vivid\r\nand eager throng of his fellows in love. Her will, their will, had been\r\ndone. But, there rose to her lips the old, old question that withers\r\nvictory--\xe2\x80\x9cTo what end?\xe2\x80\x9d Her eyes ranged along the tables, and an\r\nappalling sense of loneliness swept over her. She turned away, wrapping\r\nthe folds of her cloak closer across her breast. Not in this College\r\nonly, but through and through Oxford, there was no heart that beat for\r\nher--no, not one, she told herself, with that instinct for self-torture\r\nwhich comes to souls in torment. She was utterly alone to-night in the\r\nmidst of a vast indifference. She! She! Was it possible? Were the gods\r\nso merciless? Ah no, surely...\r\n\r\nDown at the high table the feast drew to its close, and very different\r\nwas the mood of the feasters from that of the young woman whose glance\r\nhad for a moment rested on their unromantic heads. Generations of\r\nundergraduates had said that Oxford would be all very well but for the\r\ndons. Do you suppose that the dons had had no answering sentiment? Youth\r\nis a very good thing to possess, no doubt; but it is a tiresome setting\r\nfor maturity. Youth all around prancing, vociferating, mocking; callow\r\nand alien youth, having to be looked after and studied and taught,\r\nas though nothing but it mattered, term after term--and now, all of a\r\nsudden, in mid-term, peace, ataraxy, a profound and leisured stillness.\r\nNo lectures to deliver to-morrow; no \xe2\x80\x9cessays\xe2\x80\x9d to hear and criticise;\r\ntime for the unvexed pursuit of pure learning...\r\n\r\nAs the Fellows passed out on their way to Common Room, there to tackle\r\nwith a fresh appetite Pedby\xe2\x80\x99s grace, they paused, as was their wont, on\r\nthe steps of the Hall, looking up at the sky, envisaging the weather.\r\nThe wind had dropped. There was even a glimpse of the moon riding behind\r\nthe clouds. And now, a solemn and plangent token of Oxford\xe2\x80\x99s perpetuity,\r\nthe first stroke of Great Tom sounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nStroke by stroke, the great familiar monody of that incomparable curfew\r\nrose and fell in the stillness.\r\n\r\nNothing of Oxford lingers more surely than it in the memory of Oxford\r\nmen; and to one revisiting these groves nothing is more eloquent of that\r\nscrupulous historic economy whereby his own particular past is utilised\r\nas the general present and future. \xe2\x80\x9cAll\xe2\x80\x99s as it was, all\xe2\x80\x99s as it will\r\nbe,\xe2\x80\x9d says Great Tom; and that is what he stubbornly said on the evening\r\nI here record.\r\n\r\nStroke by measured and leisured stroke, the old euphonious clangour\r\npervaded Oxford, spreading out over the meadows, along the river,\r\naudible in Iffley. But to the dim groups gathering and dispersing on\r\neither bank, and to the silent workers in the boats, the bell\xe2\x80\x99s message\r\ncame softened, equivocal; came as a requiem for these dead.\r\n\r\nOver the closed gates of Iffley lock, the water gushed down, eager for\r\nthe sacrament of the sea. Among the supine in the field hard by, there\r\nwas one whose breast bore a faint-gleaming star. And bending over him,\r\nlooking down at him with much love and pity in her eyes, was the shade\r\nof Nellie O\xe2\x80\x99Mora, that \xe2\x80\x9cfairest witch,\xe2\x80\x9d to whose memory he had to-day\r\natoned.\r\n\r\nAnd yonder, \xe2\x80\x9csitting upon the river-bank o\xe2\x80\x99ergrown,\xe2\x80\x9d with questioning\r\neyes, was another shade, more habituated to these haunts--the shade\r\nknown so well to bathers \xe2\x80\x9cin the abandoned lasher,\xe2\x80\x9d and to dancers\r\n\xe2\x80\x9caround the Fyfield elm in May.\xe2\x80\x9d At the bell\xe2\x80\x99s final stroke, the Scholar\r\nGipsy rose, letting fall on the water his gathered wild-flowers, and\r\npassed towards Cumnor.\r\n\r\nAnd now, duly, throughout Oxford, the gates of the Colleges were closed,\r\nand closed were the doors of the lodging-houses. Every night, for many\r\nyears, at this hour precisely, Mrs. Batch had come out from her kitchen,\r\nto turn the key in the front-door. The function had long ago become\r\nautomatic. To-night, however, it was the cue for further tears. These\r\ndid not cease at her return to the kitchen, where she had gathered\r\nabout her some sympathetic neighbours--women of her own age and\r\nkind, capacious of tragedy; women who might be relied on; founts of\r\nejaculation, wells of surmise, downpours of remembered premonitions.\r\n\r\nWith his elbows on the kitchen table, and his knuckles to his brow, sat\r\nClarence, intent on belated \xe2\x80\x9cprep.\xe2\x80\x9d Even an eye-witness of disaster may\r\npall if he repeat his story too often. Clarence had noted in the last\r\nrecital that he was losing his hold on his audience. So now he sat\r\ncommitting to memory the names of the cantons of Switzerland, and waving\r\naside with a harsh gesture such questions as were still put to him by\r\nthe women.\r\n\r\nKatie had sought refuge in the need for \xe2\x80\x9cputting the gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s rooms\r\nstraight,\xe2\x80\x9d against the arrival of the two families to-morrow. Duster\r\nin hand, and by the light of a single candle that barely survived the\r\ndraught from the open window, she moved to and fro about the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom, a wan and listless figure, casting queerest shadows on the\r\nceiling. There were other candles that she might have lit, but this\r\nambiguous gloom suited her sullen humour. Yes, I am sorry to say, Katie\r\nwas sullen. She had not ceased to mourn the Duke; but it was even more\r\nanger than grief that she felt at his dying. She was as sure as ever\r\nthat he had not loved Miss Dobson; but this only made it the more\r\noutrageous that he had died because of her. What was there in this woman\r\nthat men should so demean themselves for her? Katie, as you know, had at\r\nfirst been unaffected by the death of the undergraduates at large. But,\r\nbecause they too had died for Zuleika, she was bitterly incensed against\r\nthem now. What could they have admired in such a woman? She didn\xe2\x80\x99t even\r\nlook like a lady. Katie caught the dim reflection of herself in the\r\nmirror. She took the candle from the table, and examined the reflection\r\nclosely. She was sure she was just as pretty as Miss Dobson. It was only\r\nthe clothes that made the difference--the clothes and the behaviour.\r\nKatie threw back her head, and smiled brilliantly, hand on hip. She\r\nnodded reassuringly at herself; and the black pearl and the pink danced\r\na duet. She put the candle down, and undid her hair, roughly parting\r\nit on one side, and letting it sweep down over the further eyebrow. She\r\nfixed it in that fashion, and posed accordingly. Now! But gradually her\r\nsmile relaxed, and a mist came to her eyes. For she had to admit that\r\neven so, after all, she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t just that something which somehow Miss\r\nDobson had. She put away from her the hasty dream she had had of a whole\r\nfuture generation of undergraduates drowning themselves, every one, in\r\nhonour of her. She went wearily on with her work.\r\n\r\nPresently, after a last look round, she went up the creaking stairs, to\r\ndo Mr. Noaks\xe2\x80\x99 room.\r\n\r\nShe found on the table that screed which her mother had recited so often\r\nthis evening. She put it in the waste-paper basket.\r\n\r\nAlso on the table were a lexicon, a Thucydides, and some note-books.\r\nThese she took and shelved without a tear for the closed labours they\r\nbore witness to.\r\n\r\nThe next disorder that met her eye was one that gave her pause--seemed,\r\nindeed, to transfix her.\r\n\r\nMr. Noaks had never, since he came to lodge here, possessed more than\r\none pair of boots. This fact had been for her a lasting source of\r\nannoyance; for it meant that she had to polish Mr. Noaks\xe2\x80\x99 boots always\r\nin the early morning, when there were so many other things to be done,\r\ninstead of choosing her own time. Her annoyance had been all the keener\r\nbecause Mr. Noaks\xe2\x80\x99 boots more than made up in size for what they lacked\r\nin number. Either of them singly took more time and polish than any\r\nother pair imaginable. She would have recognised them, at a glance,\r\nanywhere. Even so now, it was at a glance that she recognised the toes\r\nof them protruding from beneath the window-curtain. She dismissed the\r\ntheory that Mr. Noaks might have gone utterly unshod to the river. She\r\nscouted the hypothesis that his ghost could be shod thus. By process\r\nof elimination she arrived at the truth. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Noaks,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccome out of there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a slight quiver of the curtain; no more. Katie repeated her\r\nwords. There was a pause, then a convulsion of the curtain. Noaks stood\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nAlways, in polishing his boots, Katie had found herself thinking of him\r\nas a man of prodigious stature, well though she knew him to be quite\r\ntiny. Even so now, at recognition of his boots, she had fixed her eyes\r\nto meet his, when he should emerge, a full yard too high. With a sharp\r\ndrop she focussed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy what right,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you come prying about my room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a stroke so unexpected that it left Katie mute. It equally\r\nsurprised Noaks, who had been about to throw himself on his knees and\r\nimplore this girl not to betray him. He was quick, though, to clinch his\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis the first time I have caught you. Let it be the\r\nlast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWas this the little man she had so long despised, and so superciliously\r\nserved? His very smallness gave him an air of concentrated force. She\r\nremembered having read that all the greatest men in history had been of\r\nless than the middle height. And--oh, her heart leapt--here was the\r\none man who had scorned to die for Miss Dobson. He alone had held out\r\nagainst the folly of his fellows. Sole and splendid survivor he stood,\r\nrock-footed, before her. And impulsively she abased herself, kneeling at\r\nhis feet as at the great double altar of some dark new faith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are great, sir, you are wonderful,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, gazing up to him,\r\nrapt. It was the first time she had ever called him \xe2\x80\x9csir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is easier, as Michelet suggested, for a woman to change her opinion\r\nof a man than for him to change his opinion of himself. Noaks, despite\r\nthe presence of mind he had shown a few moments ago, still saw himself\r\nas he had seen himself during the past hours: that is, as an arrant\r\nlittle coward--one who by his fear to die had put himself outside the\r\npale of decent manhood. He had meant to escape from the house at dead of\r\nnight and, under an assumed name, work his passage out to Australia--a\r\nland which had always made strong appeal to his imagination. No one, he\r\nhad reflected, would suppose because his body was not retrieved from\r\nthe water that he had not perished with the rest. And he had looked to\r\nAustralia to make a man of him yet: in Encounter Bay, perhaps, or in the\r\nGulf of Carpentaria, he might yet end nobly.\r\n\r\nThus Katie\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour was as much an embarrassment as a relief; and he\r\nasked her in what way he was great and wonderful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cModest, like all heroes!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, and, still kneeling, proceeded to\r\nsing his praises with a so infectious fervour that Noaks did begin to\r\nfeel he had done a fine thing in not dying. After all, was it not moral\r\ncowardice as much as love that had tempted him to die? He had wrestled\r\nwith it, thrown it. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, when her rhapsody was over, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps\r\nI am modest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is why you hid yourself just now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he gladly said. \xe2\x80\x9cI hid myself for the same reason,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhen I heard your mother\xe2\x80\x99s footstep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d she faltered, with a sudden doubt, \xe2\x80\x9cthat bit of writing which\r\nMother found on the table--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat? Oh, that was only a general reflection, copied out of a book.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, won\xe2\x80\x99t poor Mother be glad when she knows!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want her to know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noaks, with a return of nervousness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t tell any one. I--the fact is--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that is so like you!\xe2\x80\x9d the girl said tenderly. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it was\r\nyour modesty that all this while blinded me. Please, sir, I have a\r\nconfession to make to you. Never till to-night have I loved you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nExquisite was the shock of these words to one who, not without reason,\r\nhad always assumed that no woman would ever love him. Before he knew\r\nwhat he was doing, he had bent down and kissed the sweet upturned face.\r\nIt was the first kiss he had ever given outside his family circle. It\r\nwas an artless and a resounding kiss.\r\n\r\nHe started back, dazed. What manner of man, he wondered, was he? A\r\ncoward, piling profligacy on poltroonery? Or a hero, claiming exemption\r\nfrom moral law? What was done could not be undone; but it could be\r\nrighted. He drew off from the little finger of his left hand that iron\r\nring which, after a twinge of rheumatism, he had to-day resumed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWear it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean--?\xe2\x80\x9d She leapt to her feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat we are engaged. I hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t think we have any choice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe clapped her hands, like the child she was, and adjusted the ring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very simple,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered lightly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a change\r\nof tone, \xe2\x80\x9cit is very durable. And that is the important thing. For I\r\nshall not be in a position to marry before I am forty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA shadow of disappointment hovered over Katie\xe2\x80\x99s clear young brow, but\r\nwas instantly chased away by the thought that to be engaged was almost\r\nas splendid as to be married.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRecently,\xe2\x80\x9d said her lover, \xe2\x80\x9cI meditated leaving Oxford for Australia.\r\nBut now that you have come into my life, I am compelled to drop that\r\nnotion, and to carve out the career I had first set for myself. A year\r\nhence, if I get a Second in Greats--and I SHALL\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a\r\nfierce look that entranced her--\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have a very good chance of an\r\nassistant-mastership in a good private school. In eighteen years, if I\r\nam careful--and, with you waiting for me, I SHALL be careful--my savings\r\nwill enable me to start a small school of my own, and to take a wife.\r\nEven then it would be more prudent to wait another five years, no doubt.\r\nBut there was always a streak of madness in the Noakses. I say \xe2\x80\x98Prudence\r\nto the winds!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, don\xe2\x80\x99t say that!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Katie, laying a hand on his sleeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right. Never hesitate to curb me. And,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, touching the\r\nring, \xe2\x80\x9can idea has just occurred to me. When the time comes, let this\r\nbe the wedding-ring. Gold is gaudy--not at all the thing for a\r\nschoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s bride. It is a pity,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, examining her through\r\nhis spectacles, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your hair is so golden. A schoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s bride\r\nshould--Good heavens! Those ear-rings! Where did you get THEM?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were given to me to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d Katie faltered. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Duke gave me them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, sir, he gave me them as a memento.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that memento shall immediately be handed over to his executors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think so!\xe2\x80\x9d was on the tip of Noaks\xe2\x80\x99 tongue, but suddenly he\r\nceased to see the pearls as trinkets finite and inapposite--saw them,\r\nin a flash, as things transmutable by sale hereafter into desks, forms,\r\nblack-boards, maps, lockers, cubicles, gravel soil, diet unlimited, and\r\nspecial attention to backward pupils. Simultaneously, he saw how mean\r\nhad been his motive for repudiating the gift. What more despicable than\r\njealousy of a man deceased? What sillier than to cast pearls before\r\nexecutors? Sped by nothing but the pulse of his hot youth, he had wooed\r\nand won this girl. Why flinch from her unsought dowry?\r\n\r\nHe told her his vision. Her eyes opened wide to it. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd oh,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthen we can be married as soon as you take your degree!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bade her not be so foolish. Who ever heard of a head-master aged\r\nthree-and-twenty? What parent or guardian would trust a stripling? The\r\nengagement must run its course. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, fidgeting, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you know\r\nthat I have hardly done any reading to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want to read NOW--TO-NIGHT?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must put in a good two hours. Where are the books that were on my\r\ntable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReverently--he was indeed a king of men--she took the books down from\r\nthe shelf, and placed them where she had found them. And she knew not\r\nwhich thrilled her the more--the kiss he gave her at parting, or the\r\ntone in which he told her that the one thing he could not and would not\r\nstand was having his books disturbed.\r\n\r\nStill less than before attuned to the lugubrious session downstairs, she\r\nwent straight up to her attic, and did a little dance there in the\r\ndark. She threw open the lattice of the dormer-window, and leaned out,\r\nsmiling, throbbing.\r\n\r\nThe Emperors, gazing up, saw her happy, and wondered; saw Noaks\xe2\x80\x99 ring on\r\nher finger, and would fain have shaken their grey heads.\r\n\r\nPresently she was aware of a protrusion from the window beneath hers.\r\nThe head of her beloved! Fondly she watched it, wished she could reach\r\ndown to stroke it. She loved him for having, after all, left his books.\r\nIt was sweet to be his excuse. Should she call softly to him? No, it\r\nmight shame him to be caught truant. He had already chidden her for\r\nprying. So she did but gaze down on his head silently, wondering whether\r\nin eighteen years it would be bald, wondering whether her own hair would\r\nstill have the fault of being golden. Most of all, she wondered whether\r\nhe loved her half so much as she loved him.\r\n\r\nThis happened to be precisely what he himself was wondering. Not that\r\nhe wished himself free. He was one of those in whom the will does not,\r\nexcept under very great pressure, oppose the conscience. What pressure\r\nhere? Miss Batch was a superior girl; she would grace any station in\r\nlife. He had always been rather in awe of her. It was a fine thing to be\r\nsuddenly loved by her, to be in a position to over-rule her every whim.\r\nPlighting his troth, he had feared she would be an encumbrance, only to\r\nfind she was a lever. But--was he deeply in love with her? How was it\r\nthat he could not at this moment recall her features, or the tone of her\r\nvoice, while of deplorable Miss Dobson, every lineament, every accent,\r\nso vividly haunted him? Try as he would to beat off these memories, he\r\nfailed, and--some very great pressure here!--was glad he failed; glad\r\nthough he found himself relapsing to the self-contempt from which Miss\r\nBatch had raised him. He scorned himself for being alive. And again, he\r\nscorned himself for his infidelity. Yet he was glad he could not forget\r\nthat face, that voice--that queen. She had smiled at him when she\r\nborrowed the ring. She had said \xe2\x80\x9cThank you.\xe2\x80\x9d Oh, and now, at this very\r\nmoment, sleeping or waking, actually she was somewhere--she! herself!\r\nThis was an incredible, an indubitable, an all-magical fact for the\r\nlittle fellow.\r\n\r\nFrom the street below came a faint cry that was as the cry of his own\r\nheart, uttered by her own lips. Quaking, he peered down, and dimly saw,\r\nover the way, a cloaked woman.\r\n\r\nShe--yes, it was she herself--came gliding to the middle of the road,\r\ngazing up at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last!\xe2\x80\x9d he heard her say. His instinct was to hide himself from the\r\nqueen he had not died for. Yet he could not move.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr,\xe2\x80\x9d she quavered, \xe2\x80\x9care you a phantom sent to mock me? Speak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening,\xe2\x80\x9d he said huskily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew the gods were not so cruel. Oh man of my\r\nneed,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, stretching out her arms to him, \xe2\x80\x9coh heaven-sent, I see\r\nyou only as a dark outline against the light of your room. But I know\r\nyou. Your name is Noaks, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Dobson is mine. I am your Warden\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrand-daughter. I am faint and foot-sore. I have ranged this desert city\r\nin search of--of YOU. Let me hear from your own lips that you love me.\r\nTell me in your own words--\xe2\x80\x9d She broke off with a little scream, and did\r\nnot stand with forefinger pointed at him, gazing, gasping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Miss Dobson,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered, writhing under what he took to be\r\nthe lash of her irony. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me time to explain. You see me here--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cman of my greater, my deeper and nobler need!\r\nOh hush, ideal which not consciously I was out for to-night--ideal\r\nvouchsafed to me by a crowning mercy! I sought a lover, I find a master.\r\nI sought but a live youth, was blind to what his survival would betoken.\r\nOh master, you think me light and wicked. You stare coldly down at me\r\nthrough your spectacles, whose glint I faintly discern now that the moon\r\npeeps forth. You would be readier to forgive me the havoc I have wrought\r\nif you could for the life of you understand what charm your friends\r\nfound in me. You marvel, as at the skull of Helen of Troy. No, you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink me hideous: you simply think me plain. There was a time when I\r\nthought YOU plain--you whose face, now that the moon shines full on it,\r\nis seen to be of a beauty that is flawless without being insipid. Oh\r\nthat I were a glove upon that hand, that I might touch that cheek! You\r\nshudder at the notion of such contact. My voice grates on you. You try\r\nto silence me with frantic though exquisite gestures, and with noises\r\ninarticulate but divine. I bow to your will, master. Chasten me with\r\nyour tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not what you think me,\xe2\x80\x9d gibbered Noaks. \xe2\x80\x9cI was not afraid to die\r\nfor you. I love you. I was on my way to the river this afternoon, but\r\nI--I tripped and sprained my ankle, and--and jarred my spine. They\r\ncarried me back here. I am still very weak. I can\xe2\x80\x99t put my foot to the\r\nground. As soon as I can--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust then Zuleika heard a little sharp sound which, for the fraction of\r\nan instant, before she knew it to be a clink of metal on the pavement,\r\nshe thought was the breaking of the heart within her. Looking quickly\r\ndown, she heard a shrill girlish laugh aloft. Looking quickly up,\r\nshe descried at the unlit window above her lover\xe2\x80\x99s a face which she\r\nremembered as that of the land-lady\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFind it, Miss Dobson,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cCrawl for it. It can\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nrolled far, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the only engagement-ring you\xe2\x80\x99ll get from HIM,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, pointing to the livid face twisted painfully up at her from the\r\nlower window. \xe2\x80\x9cGrovel for it, Miss Dobson. Ask him to step down and help\r\nyou. Oh, he can! That was all lies about his spine and ankle. Afraid,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what he was--I see it all now--afraid of the water. I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nfound him as I did--skulking behind the curtain. Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t listen,\xe2\x80\x9d Noaks cried down. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t listen to that person. I admit\r\nI have trifled with her affections. This is her revenge--these wicked\r\nuntruths--these--these--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZuleika silenced him with a gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cYour tone to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said up to\r\nKatie, \xe2\x80\x9cis not without offence; but the stamp of truth is on what you\r\ntell me. We have both been deceived in this man, and are, in some sort,\r\nsisters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSisters?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Katie. \xe2\x80\x9cYour sisters are the snake and the spider,\r\nthough neither of them wishes it known. I loathe you. And the Duke\r\nloathed you, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Zuleika.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t he tell you? He told me. And I warrant he told you, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe died for love of me: d\xe2\x80\x99you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you\xe2\x80\x99d like people to think so, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you? Does a man who loves a\r\nwoman give away the keepsake she gave him? Look!\xe2\x80\x9d Katie leaned forward,\r\npointing to her ear-rings. \xe2\x80\x9cHe loved ME,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cHe put them in with\r\nhis own hands--told me to wear them always. And he kissed me--kissed me\r\ngood-bye in the street, where every one could see. He kissed me,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsobbed. \xe2\x80\x9cNo other man shall ever do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that he did!\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice level with Zuleika. It was the voice of\r\nMrs. Batch, who a few moments ago had opened the door for her departing\r\nguests.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that he did!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the guests.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind them, Miss Dobson,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Noaks, and at the sound of his\r\nvoice Mrs. Batch rushed into the middle of the road, to gaze up. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_\r\nlove you. Think what you will of me. I--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou!\xe2\x80\x9d flashed Zuleika. \xe2\x80\x9cAs for you, little Sir Lily Liver, leaning\r\nout there, and, I frankly tell you, looking like nothing so much as a\r\ngargoyle hewn by a drunken stone-mason for the adornment of a Methodist\r\nChapel in one of the vilest suburbs of Leeds or Wigan, I do but\r\nfelicitate the river-god and his nymphs that their water was saved\r\nto-day by your cowardice from the contamination of your plunge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShame on you, Mr. Noaks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Batch, \xe2\x80\x9cmaking believe you were\r\ndead--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShame!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed Clarence, who had darted out into the fray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI found him hiding behind the curtain,\xe2\x80\x9d chimed in Katie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I a mother to him!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Batch, shaking her fist. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What is\r\nlife without love?\xe2\x80\x99 indeed! Oh, the cowardly, underhand--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWretch,\xe2\x80\x9d prompted her cronies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s kick him out of the house!\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Clarence, dancing for joy.\r\n\r\nZuleika, smiling brilliantly down at the boy, said \xe2\x80\x9cJust you run up and\r\nfight him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight you are,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, with a look of knightly devotion, and\r\ndarted back into the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo escape!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried up to Noaks. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to fight him now. He and\r\nyou are just about evenly matched, I fancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, grimly enough, Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s estimate was never put to the test. Is\r\nit harder for a coward to fight with his fists than to kill himself? Or\r\nagain, is it easier for him to die than to endure a prolonged cross-fire\r\nof women\xe2\x80\x99s wrath and scorn? This I know: that in the life of even the\r\nleast and meanest of us there is somewhere one fine moment--one high\r\nchance not missed. I like to think it was by operation of this law that\r\nNoaks had now clambered out upon the window-sill, silencing, sickening,\r\nscattering like chaff the women beneath him.\r\n\r\nHe was already not there when Clarence bounded into the room. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n yelled the boy, first thrusting his head behind the door, then diving\r\nbeneath the table, then plucking aside either window-curtain, vowing\r\nvengeance.\r\n\r\nVengeance was not his. Down on the road without, not yet looked at but\r\nby the steadfast eyes of the Emperors, the last of the undergraduates\r\nlay dead; and fleet-footed Zuleika, with her fingers still pressed to\r\nher ears, had taken full toll now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nTwisting and turning in her flight, with wild eyes that fearfully\r\nretained the image of that small man gathering himself to spring,\r\nZuleika found herself suddenly where she could no further go.\r\n\r\nShe was in that grim ravine by which you approach New College. At sight\r\nof the great shut gate before her, she halted, and swerved to the wall.\r\nShe set her brow and the palms of her hands against the cold stones. She\r\nthrew back her head, and beat the stones with her fists.\r\n\r\nIt was not only what she had seen, it was what she had barely saved\r\nherself from seeing, and what she had not quite saved herself from\r\nhearing, that she strove so piteously to forget. She was sorrier for\r\nherself, angrier, than she had been last night when the Duke laid hands\r\non her. Why should every day have a horrible ending? Last night she\r\nhad avenged herself. To-night\xe2\x80\x99s outrage was all the more foul and mean\r\nbecause of its certain immunity. And the fact that she had in some\r\nmeasure brought it on herself did but whip her rage. What a fool she\r\nhad been to taunt the man! Yet no, how could she have foreseen that he\r\nwould--do THAT? How could she have guessed that he, who had not dared\r\nseemly death for her in the gentle river, would dare--THAT?\r\n\r\nShe shuddered the more as she now remembered that this very day, in that\r\nvery house, she had invited for her very self a similar fate. What if\r\nthe Duke had taken her word? Strange! she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have flinched then.\r\nShe had felt no horror at the notion of such a death. And thus she now\r\nsaw Noaks\xe2\x80\x99 conduct in a new light--saw that he had but wished to prove\r\nhis love, not at all to affront her. This understanding quickly steadied\r\nher nerves. She did not need now to forget what she had seen; and, not\r\nneeding to forget it--thus are our brains fashioned--she was able to\r\nforget it.\r\n\r\nBut by removal of one load her soul was but bared for a more grievous\r\nother. Her memory harked back to what had preceded the crisis. She\r\nrecalled those moments of doomed rapture in which her heart had soared\r\nup to the apocalyptic window--recalled how, all the while she was\r\nspeaking to the man there, she had been chafed by the inadequacy of\r\nlanguage. Oh, how much more she had meant than she could express! Oh,\r\nthe ecstasy of that self-surrender! And the brevity of it! the sudden\r\nodious awakening! Thrice in this Oxford she had been duped. Thrice all\r\nthat was fine and sweet in her had leapt forth, only to be scourged back\r\ninto hiding. Poor heart inhibited! She gazed about her. The stone alley\r\nshe had come into, the terrible shut gate, were for her a visible symbol\r\nof the destiny she had to put up with. Wringing her hands, she hastened\r\nalong the way she had come. She vowed she would never again set foot in\r\nOxford. She wished herself out of the hateful little city to-night. She\r\neven wished herself dead.\r\n\r\nShe deserved to suffer, you say? Maybe. I merely state that she did\r\nsuffer.\r\n\r\nEmerging into Catherine Street, she knew whereabouts she was, and made\r\nstraight for Judas, turning away her eyes as she skirted the Broad, that\r\nplace of mocked hopes and shattered ideals.\r\n\r\nComing into Judas Street, she remembered the scene of yesterday--the\r\nhappy man with her, the noise of the vast happy crowd. She suffered in\r\na worse form what she had suffered in the gallery of the Hall. For\r\nnow--did I not say she was not without imagination?--her self-pity was\r\nsharpened by remorse for the hundreds of homes robbed. She realised the\r\ntruth of what the poor Duke had once said to her: she was a danger in\r\nthe world... Aye, and all the more dire now. What if the youth of all\r\nEurope were moved by Oxford\xe2\x80\x99s example? That was a horribly possible\r\nthing. It must be reckoned with. It must be averted. She must not show\r\nherself to men. She must find some hiding-place, and there abide. Were\r\nthis a hardship? she asked herself. Was she not sickened for ever of\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x99s homage? And was it not clear now that the absorbing need in her\r\nsoul, the need to love, would never--except for a brief while, now and\r\nthen, and by an unfortunate misunderstanding--be fulfilled?\r\n\r\nSo long ago that you may not remember, I compared her favourably with\r\nthe shepherdess Marcella, and pleaded her capacity for passion as an\r\nexcuse for her remaining at large. I hope you will now, despite your\r\nrather evident animus against her, set this to her credit: that she did,\r\nso soon as she realised the hopelessness of her case, make just that\r\ndecision which I blamed Marcella for not making at the outset. It was as\r\nshe stood on the Warden\xe2\x80\x99s door-step that she decided to take the veil.\r\n\r\nWith something of a conventual hush in her voice, she said to the\r\nbutler, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease tell my maid that we are leaving by a very early train\r\nto-morrow, and that she must pack my things to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said the butler. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Warden,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cis in the\r\nstudy, Miss, and was asking for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could face her grandfather without a tremour--now. She would hear\r\nmeekly whatever reproaches he might have for her, but their sting was\r\nalready drawn by the surprise she had in store for him.\r\n\r\nIt was he who seemed a trifle nervous. In his\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, did you come and peep down from the gallery?\xe2\x80\x9d there was a\r\ndistinct tremour.\r\n\r\nThrowing aside her cloak, she went quickly to him, and laid a hand on\r\nthe lapel of his coat. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor grand-papa!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, my dear child,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, disengaging himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngive it a thought. If the young men chose to be so silly as to stay\r\naway, I--I--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrand-papa, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you been told YET?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTold? I am a Gallio for such follies. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t inquire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut (forgive me, grand-papa, if I seem to you, for the moment, pert)\r\nyou are Warden here. It is your duty, even your privilege, to GUARD.\r\nIs it not? Well, I grant you the adage that it is useless to bolt the\r\nstable door when the horse has been stolen. But what shall be said of\r\nthe ostler who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know--won\xe2\x80\x99t even \xe2\x80\x98inquire\xe2\x80\x99 whether--the horse HAS\r\nbeen stolen, grand-papa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak in riddles, Zuleika.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish with all my heart I need not tell you the answers. I think I\r\nhave a very real grievance against your staff--or whatever it is you\r\ncall your subordinates here. I go so far as to dub them dodderers. And\r\nI shall the better justify that term by not shirking the duty they have\r\nleft undone. The reason why there were no undergraduates in your Hall\r\nto-night is that they were all dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead?\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cDead? It is disgraceful that I was not told. What\r\ndid they die of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I am an epidemic, grand-papa, a scourge, such as the world has not\r\nknown. Those young men drowned themselves for love of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe came towards her. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you realise, girl, what this means to me? I am\r\nan old man. For more than half a century I have known this College. To\r\nit, when my wife died, I gave all that there was of heart left in me.\r\nFor thirty years I have been Warden; and in that charge has been all my\r\npride. I have had no thought but for this great College, its honour and\r\nprosperity. More than once lately have I asked myself whether my eyes\r\nwere growing dim, my hand less steady. \xe2\x80\x98No\xe2\x80\x99 was my answer, and again\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99 And thus it is that I have lingered on to let Judas be struck down\r\nfrom its high eminence, shamed in the eyes of England--a College for\r\never tainted, and of evil omen.\xe2\x80\x9d He raised his head. \xe2\x80\x9cThe disgrace to\r\nmyself is nothing. I care not how parents shall rage against me, and the\r\nHeads of other Colleges make merry over my decrepitude. It is because\r\nyou have wrought the downfall of Judas that I am about to lay my undying\r\ncurse on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t do that!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a sort of sacrilege. I am\r\ngoing to be a nun. Besides, why should you? I can quite well understand\r\nyour feeling for Judas. But how is Judas more disgraced than any other\r\nCollege? If it were only the Judas undergraduates who had--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were others?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Warden. \xe2\x80\x9cHow many?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll. All the boys from all the Colleges.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Warden heaved a deep sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthis changes the\r\naspect of the whole matter. I wish you had made it clear at once. You\r\ngave me a very great shock,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sinking into his arm-chair, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nhave not yet recovered. You must study the art of exposition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will depend on the rules of the convent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I forgot that you were going into a convent. Anglican, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnglican, she supposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a young man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI saw much of dear old Dr. Pusey. It might\r\nhave somewhat reconciled him to my marriage if he had known that my\r\ngrand-daughter would take the veil.\xe2\x80\x9d He adjusted his glasses, and looked\r\nat her. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure you have a vocation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I want to be out of the world. I want to do no more harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe eyed her musingly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis rather a revulsion than\r\na vocation. I remember that I ventured to point out to Dr. Pusey the\r\ndifference between those two things, when he was almost persuading me\r\nto enter a Brotherhood founded by one of his friends. It may be that the\r\nworld would be well rid of you, my dear child. But it is not the world\r\nonly that we must consider. Would you grace the recesses of the Church?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could but try,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zuleika.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You could but try\xe2\x80\x99 are the very words Dr. Pusey used to me. I ventured\r\nto say that in such a matter effort itself was a stigma of unfitness.\r\nFor all my moods of revulsion, I knew that my place was in the world. I\r\nstayed there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut suppose, grand-papa\xe2\x80\x9d--and, seeing in fancy the vast agitated\r\nflotilla of crinolines, she could not forbear a smile--\xe2\x80\x9csuppose all the\r\nyoung ladies of that period had drowned themselves for love of you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer smile seemed to nettle the Warden. \xe2\x80\x9cI was greatly admired,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreatly,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you liked that, grand-papa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear. Yes, I am afraid I did. But I never encouraged it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour own heart was never touched?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, until I met Laura Frith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was my future wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how was it you singled her out from the rest? Was she very\r\nbeautiful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. It cannot be said that she was beautiful. Indeed, she was accounted\r\nplain. I think it was her great dignity that attracted me. She did not\r\nsmile archly at me, nor shake her ringlets. In those days it was the\r\nfashion for young ladies to embroider slippers for such men in holy\r\norders as best pleased their fancy. I received hundreds--thousands--of\r\nsuch slippers. But never a pair from Laura Frith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe did not love you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Zuleika, who had seated herself on the\r\nfloor at her grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\r\n\r\nI concluded that she did not. It interested me very greatly. It fired\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas she incapable of love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it was notorious in her circle that she had loved often, but loved\r\nin vain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did she marry you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she was fatigued by my importunities. She was not very strong.\r\nBut it may be that she married me out of pique. She never told me. I did\r\nnot inquire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet you were very happy with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile she lived, I was ideally happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young woman stretched out a hand, and laid it on the clasped hands\r\nof the old man. He sat gazing into the past. She was silent for a while;\r\nand in her eyes, still fixed intently on his face, there were tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrand-papa dear\xe2\x80\x9d--but there were tears in her voice, too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy child, you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. If I had needed pity--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do understand--so well. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t pitying you, dear, I was envying you\r\na little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe?--an old man with only the remembrance of happiness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, who have had happiness granted to you. That isn\xe2\x80\x99t what made me\r\ncry, though. I cried because I was glad. You and I, with all this great\r\nspan of years between us, and yet--so wonderfully alike! I had always\r\nthought of myself as a creature utterly apart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that is how all young people think of themselves. It wears off.\r\nTell me about this wonderful resemblance of ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat attentive while she described her heart to him. But when, at the\r\nclose of her confidences, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cSo you see it\xe2\x80\x99s a case of sheer\r\nheredity, grand-papa,\xe2\x80\x9d the word \xe2\x80\x9cFiddlesticks!\xe2\x80\x9d would out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, patting her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI was very much\r\ninterested. But I do believe young people are even more staggered by\r\nthemselves than they were in my day. And then, all these grand theories\r\nthey fall back on! Heredity... as if there were something to baffle us\r\nin the fact of a young woman liking to be admired! And as if it were\r\npassing strange of her to reserve her heart for a man she can respect\r\nand look up to! And as if a man\xe2\x80\x99s indifference to her were not of all\r\nthings the likeliest to give her a sense of inferiority to him! You and\r\nI, my dear, may in some respects be very queer people, but in the matter\r\nof the affections we are ordinary enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh grand-papa, do you really mean that?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt my age, a man husbands his resources. He says nothing that he does\r\nnot really mean. The indifference between you and other young women\r\nis that which lay also between me and other young men: a special\r\nattractiveness... Thousands of slippers, did I say? Tens of thousands. I\r\nhad hoarded them with a fatuous pride. On the evening of my betrothal I\r\nmade a bonfire of them, visible from three counties. I danced round it\r\nall night.\xe2\x80\x9d And from his old eyes darted even now the reflections of\r\nthose flames.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlorious!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Zuleika. \xe2\x80\x9cBut ah,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, rising to her feet,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctell me no more of it--poor me! You see, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a mere special\r\nattractiveness that _I_ have. _I_ am irresistible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA daring statement, my child--very hard to prove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t it been proved up to the hilt to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-day?... Ah, and so they did really all drown themselves for you?...\r\nDear, dear!... The Duke--he, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe set the example.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! You don\xe2\x80\x99t say so! He was a greatly-gifted young man--a true\r\nornament to the College. But he always seemed to me rather--what shall I\r\nsay?--inhuman... I remember now that he did seem rather excited when\r\nhe came to the concert last night and you weren\xe2\x80\x99t yet there... You are\r\nquite sure you were the cause of his death?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zuleika, marvelling at the lie--or fib, rather: he had\r\nbeen GOING to die for her. But why not have told the truth? Was it\r\npossible, she wondered, that her wretched vanity had survived her\r\nrenunciation of the world? Why had she so resented just now the doubt\r\ncast on that irresistibility which had blighted and cranked her whole\r\nlife?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Warden, \xe2\x80\x9cI confess that I am\r\namazed--astounded.\xe2\x80\x9d Again he adjusted his glasses, and looked at her.\r\n\r\nShe found herself moving slowly around the study, with the gait of a\r\nmannequin in a dress-maker\xe2\x80\x99s show-room. She tried to stop this; but her\r\nbody seemed to be quite beyond control of her mind. It had the insolence\r\nto go ambling on its own account. \xe2\x80\x9cLittle space you\xe2\x80\x99ll have in a convent\r\ncell,\xe2\x80\x9d snarled her mind vindictively. Her body paid no heed whatever.\r\n\r\nHer grandfather, leaning back in his chair, gazed at the ceiling, and\r\nmeditatively tapped the finger-tips of one hand against those of the\r\nother. \xe2\x80\x9cSister Zuleika,\xe2\x80\x9d he presently said to the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? and what is there so--so ridiculous in\xe2\x80\x9d--but the rest was lost in\r\ntrill after trill of laughter; and these were then lost in sobs.\r\n\r\nThe Warden had risen from his chair. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlaughing. I was only--trying to imagine. If you really want to retire\r\nfrom--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d moaned Zuleika.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen perhaps--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she wailed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, you don\xe2\x80\x99t, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, you are tired, my poor child. That is very natural after this\r\nwonderful, this historic day. Come dry your eyes. There, that\xe2\x80\x99s better.\r\nTo-morrow--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do believe you\xe2\x80\x99re a little proud of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forgive me, I believe I am. A grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s heart--But there,\r\ngood night, my dear. Let me light your candle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took her cloak, and followed him out to the hall table. There she\r\nmentioned that she was going away early to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the convent?\xe2\x80\x9d he slyly asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, don\xe2\x80\x99t tease me, grand-papa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am sorry you are going away, my dear. But perhaps, in the\r\ncircumstances, it is best. You must come and stay here again, later\r\non,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, handing her the lit candle. \xe2\x80\x9cNot in term-time, though,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she echoed, \xe2\x80\x9cnot in term-time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\nFrom the shifting gloom of the stair-case to the soft radiance cast\r\nthrough the open door of her bedroom was for poor Zuleika an almost\r\nheartening transition. She stood awhile on the threshold, watching\r\nMelisande dart to and fro like a shuttle across a loom. Already the main\r\npart of the packing seemed to have been accomplished. The wardrobe was a\r\nyawning void, the carpet was here and there visible, many of the\r\ntrunks were already brimming and foaming over... Once more on the road!\r\nSomewhat as, when beneath the stars the great tent had been struck, and\r\nthe lions were growling in their vans, and the horses were pawing the\r\nstamped grass and whinnying, and the elephants trumpeting, Zuleika\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother may often have felt within her a wan exhilaration, so now did the\r\nheart of that mother\xe2\x80\x99s child rise and flutter amidst the familiar bustle\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cbeing off.\xe2\x80\x9d Weary she was of the world, and angry she was at not\r\nbeing, after all, good enough for something better. And yet--well, at\r\nleast, good-bye to Oxford!\r\n\r\nShe envied Melisande, so nimbly and cheerfully laborious till the day\r\nshould come when her betrothed had saved enough to start a little cafe\r\nof his own and make her his bride and dame de comptoir. Oh, to have a\r\npurpose, a prospect, a stake in the world, as this faithful soul had!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I help you at all, Melisande?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, picking her way across\r\nthe strewn floor.\r\n\r\nMelisande, patting down a pile of chiffon, seemed to be amused at such\r\na notion. \xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle has her own art. Do I mix myself in that?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncried, waving one hand towards the great malachite casket.\r\n\r\nZuleika looked at the casket, and then very gratefully at the maid. Her\r\nart--how had she forgotten that? Here was solace, purpose. She would\r\nwork as she had never worked yet. She KNEW that she had it in her to do\r\nbetter than she had ever done. She confessed to herself that she had too\r\noften been slack in the matter of practice and rehearsal, trusting her\r\npersonal magnetism to carry her through. Only last night she had badly\r\nfumbled, more than once. Her bravura business with the Demon Egg-Cup had\r\nbeen simply vile. The audience hadn\xe2\x80\x99t noticed it, perhaps, but she\r\nhad. Now she would perfect herself. Barely a fortnight now before her\r\nengagement at the Folies Bergeres! What if--no, she must not think of\r\nthat! But the thought insisted. What if she essayed for Paris that\r\nwhich again and again she had meant to graft on to her repertory--the\r\nProvoking Thimble?\r\n\r\nShe flushed at the possibility. What if her whole present repertory were\r\nbut a passing phase in her art--a mere beginning--an earlier manner? She\r\nremembered how marvellously last night she had manipulated the ear-rings\r\nand the studs. Then lo! the light died out of her eyes, and her face\r\ngrew rigid. That memory had brought other memories in its wake.\r\n\r\nFor her, when she fled the Broad, Noaks\xe2\x80\x99 window had blotted out all\r\nelse. Now she saw again that higher window, saw that girl flaunting her\r\near-rings, gibing down at her. \xe2\x80\x9cHe put them in with his own hands!\xe2\x80\x9d--the\r\nwords rang again in her ears, making her cheeks tingle. Oh, he had\r\nthought it a very clever thing to do, no doubt--a splendid little\r\nrevenge, something after his own heart! \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he kissed me in the open\r\nstreet\xe2\x80\x9d--excellent, excellent! She ground her teeth. And these doings\r\nmust have been fresh in his mind when she overtook him and walked with\r\nhim to the house-boat! Infamous! And she had then been wearing his\r\nstuds! She drew his attention to them when--\r\n\r\nHer jewel-box stood open, to receive the jewels she wore to-night. She\r\nwent very calmly to it. There, in a corner of the topmost tray, rested\r\nthe two great white pearls--the pearls which, in one way and another,\r\nhad meant so much to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMelisande!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we go to Paris, would you like to make a little present to your\r\nfiance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJe voudrais bien, mademoiselle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you shall give him these,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zuleika, holding out the two\r\nstuds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMais jamais de la vie! Chez Tourtel tout le monde le dirait\r\nmillionaire. Un garcon de cafe qui porte au plastron des perles\r\npareilles--merci!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him he may tell every one that they were given to me by the late\r\nDuke of Dorset, and given by me to you, and by you to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMais--\xe2\x80\x9d The protest died on Melisande\xe2\x80\x99s lips. Suddenly she had ceased\r\nto see the pearls as trinkets finite and inapposite--saw them as things\r\npresently transmutable into little marble tables, bocks, dominos,\r\nabsinthes au sucre, shiny black portfolios with weekly journals in them,\r\nyellow staves with daily journals flapping from them, vermouths secs,\r\nvermouths cassis...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle is too amiable,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, taking the pearls.\r\n\r\nAnd certainly, just then, Zuleika was looking very amiable indeed. The\r\nlook was transient. Nothing, she reflected, could undo what the Duke had\r\ndone. That hateful, impudent girl would take good care that every one\r\nshould know. \xe2\x80\x9cHe put them in with his own hands.\xe2\x80\x9d HER ear-rings! \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nkissed me in the public street. He loved me\xe2\x80\x9d... Well, he had called out\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cZuleika!\xe2\x80\x9d and every one around had heard him. That was something. But\r\nhow glad all the old women in the world would be to shake their heads\r\nand say \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, my dear, believe me! It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything to do with HER.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m told on the very best authority,\xe2\x80\x9d and so forth, and so on. She knew\r\nhe had told any number of undergraduates he was going to die for her.\r\nBut they, poor fellows, could not bear witness. And good heavens!\r\nIf there were a doubt as to the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s motive, why not doubts as to\r\ntheirs?... But many of them had called out \xe2\x80\x9cZuleika!\xe2\x80\x9d too. And of course\r\nany really impartial person who knew anything at all about the matter at\r\nfirst hand would be sure in his own mind that it was perfectly absurd to\r\npretend that the whole thing wasn\xe2\x80\x99t entirely and absolutely for her...\r\nAnd of course some of the men must have left written evidence of their\r\nintention. She remembered that at The MacQuern\xe2\x80\x99s to-day was a Mr.\r\nCraddock, who had made a will in her favour and wanted to read it aloud\r\nto her in the middle of luncheon. Oh, there would be proof positive as\r\nto many of the men. But of the others it would be said that they died\r\nin trying to rescue their comrades. There would be all sorts of silly\r\nfar-fetched theories, and downright lies that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be disproved...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMelisande, that crackling of tissue paper is driving me mad! Do leave\r\noff! Can\xe2\x80\x99t you see that I am waiting to be undressed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe maid hastened to her side, and with quick light fingers began to\r\nundress her. \xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle va bien dormir--ca se voit,\xe2\x80\x9d she purred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zuleika.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it was soothing to be undressed, and yet more soothing\r\nanon to sit merely night-gowned before the mirror, while, slowly and\r\ngently, strongly and strand by strand, Melisande brushed her hair.\r\n\r\nAfter all, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t so much matter what the world thought. Let the\r\nworld whisper and insinuate what it would. To slur and sully, to\r\nbelittle and drag down--that was what the world always tried to do.\r\nBut great things were still great, and fair things still fair. With no\r\nthought for the world\xe2\x80\x99s opinion had these men gone down to the water\r\nto-day. Their deed was for her and themselves alone. It had sufficed\r\nthem. Should it not suffice her? It did, oh it did. She was a wretch to\r\nhave repined.\r\n\r\nAt a gesture from her, Melisande brought to a close the rhythmical\r\nministrations, and--using no tissue paper this time--did what was yet to\r\nbe done among the trunks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWE know, you and I,\xe2\x80\x9d Zuleika whispered to the adorable creature in the\r\nmirror; and the adorable creature gave back her nod and smile.\r\n\r\nTHEY knew, these two.\r\n\r\nYet, in their happiness, rose and floated a shadow between them. It was\r\nthe ghost of that one man who--THEY knew--had died irrelevantly, with a\r\ncold heart.\r\n\r\nCame also the horrid little ghost of one who had died late and unseemly.\r\n\r\nAnd now, thick and fast, swept a whole multitude of other ghosts, the\r\nghosts of all them who, being dead, could not die again; the poor ghosts\r\nof them who had done what they could, and could do no more.\r\n\r\nNo more? Was it not enough? The lady in the mirror gazed at the lady\r\nin the room, reproachfully at first, then--for were they not\r\nsisters?--relentingly, then pityingly. Each of the two covered her face\r\nwith her hands.\r\n\r\nAnd there recurred, as by stealth, to the lady in the room a thought\r\nthat had assailed her not long ago in Judas Street... a thought about\r\nthe power of example...\r\n\r\nAnd now, with pent breath and fast-beating heart, she stood staring at\r\nthe lady of the mirror, without seeing her; and now she wheeled round\r\nand swiftly glided to that little table on which stood her two books.\r\nShe snatched Bradshaw.\r\n\r\nWe always intervene between Bradshaw and any one whom we see consulting\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle will permit me to find that which she seeks?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nMelisande.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zuleika. We always repulse, at first, any one who\r\nintervenes between us and Bradshaw.\r\n\r\nWe always end by accepting the intervention. \xe2\x80\x9cSee if it is possible to\r\ngo direct from here to Cambridge,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zuleika, handing the book on.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it isn\xe2\x80\x99t, then--well, see how to get there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe never have any confidence in the intervener. Nor is the intervener,\r\nwhen it comes to the point, sanguine. With mistrust mounting to\r\nexasperation Zuleika sat watching the faint and frantic researches of\r\nher maid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d she said suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a much better idea. Go down very\r\nearly to the station. See the station-master. Order me a special train.\r\nFor ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRising, she stretched her arms above her head. Her lips parted in a\r\nyawn, met in a smile. With both hands she pushed back her hair from her\r\nshoulders, and twisted it into a loose knot. Very lightly she slipped up\r\ninto bed, and very soon she was asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Zuleika Dobson, by Max Beerbohm\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ZULEIKA DOBSON ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1845-0.txt or 1845-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/8/4/1845/\r\n\r\nProduced by Judy Boss\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
