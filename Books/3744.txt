YONGE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nQuand on veut dessecher un marais, on ne fait pas voter les\r\ngrenouilles.--Mme. EMILE. DE GIRADIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Richard?  That\'s right!  Here\'s a tea-cup waiting for you,\' as the\r\nalmost thirty-year-old Incumbent of Cocksmoor, still looking like a\r\nyoung deacon, entered the room with his quiet step, and silent greeting\r\nto its four inmates.\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, Ethel.  Is papa gone out?\'\r\n\r\n\'I have not seen him since dinner-time.  You said he was gone out with\r\nDr. Spencer, Aubrey?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I heard Dr. Spencer\'s voice--"I say, Dick"--like three notes of\r\nconsternation,\' said Aubrey; \'and off they went.  I fancy there\'s some\r\nillness about in the Lower Pond Buildings, that Dr. Spencer has been\r\nraging so long to get drained.\'\r\n\r\n\'The knell has been ringing for a little child there,\' added Mary;\r\n\'scarlatina, I believe--\'\r\n\r\n\'But, Richard,\' burst forth the merry voice of the youngest, \'you must\r\nsee our letters from Edinburgh.\'\r\n\r\n\'You have heard, then?  It was the very thing I came to ask.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes! there were five notes in one cover,\' said Gertrude.  \'Papa\r\nsays they are to be laid up in the family archives, and labelled "The\r\nInfants\' Honeymoon."\'\r\n\r\n\'Papa is very happy with his own share,\' said Ethel.  \'It was signed,\r\n"Still his own White Flower," and it had two Calton Hill real daisies\r\nin it.   I don\'t know when I have seen him more pleased.\'\r\n\r\n\'And Hector\'s letter--I can say that by heart,\' continued Gertrude.\r\n\'"My dear Father, This is only to say that she is the darlint, and for\r\nthe pleasure of subscribing myself--Your loving SON,"--the son as big\r\nas all the rest put together.\'\r\n\r\n\'I tell Blanche that he only took her for the pleasure of being my\r\nfather\'s son,\' said Aubrey, in his low lazy voice.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said Mary, \'even to the last, I do believe he had as soon drive\r\npapa out as walk with Blanche.  Flora was quite scandalized at it.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should not imagine that George had often driven my father out,\' said\r\nAubrey, again looking lazily up from balancing his spoon.\r\n\r\nEthel laughed; and even Richard smiled; then recovering herself, she\r\nsaid, \'Poor Hector, he never could call himself son to any one before.\'\r\n\r\n\'He has not been much otherwise here,\' said Richard.\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said Ethel; \'it is the peculiar hardship of our weddings to break\r\nus up by pairs, and carry off two instead of one.  Did you ever see me\r\nwith so shabby a row of tea-cups?  When shall I have them come in\r\nriding double again?\'\r\n\r\nThe recent wedding was the third in the family; the first after a five\r\nyears\' respite.  It ensued upon an attachment that had grown up with\r\nthe young people, so that they had been entirely one with each other;\r\nand there had been little of formal demand either of the maiden\'s\r\naffection or her father\'s consent; but both had been implied from the\r\nfirst.  The bridegroom was barely of age, the bride not seventeen, and\r\nDr. May had owned it was very shocking, and told Richard to say nothing\r\nabout it!  Hector had coaxed and pleaded, pathetically talked of his\r\ngreat empty house at Maplewood, and declared that till he might take\r\nBlanche away, he would not leave Stoneborough; he would bring down all\r\nsorts of gossip on his courtship, he would worry Ethel, and take care\r\nshe finished nobody\'s education.  What did Blanche want with more\r\neducation?  She knew enough for him.  Couldn\'t Ethel be satisfied with\r\nAubrey and Gertrude? or he dared say she might have Mary too, if she\r\nwas insatiable.  If Dr. May was so unnatural as to forbid him to hang\r\nabout the house, why, he would take rooms at the Swan.  In fact, as Dr.\r\nMay observed, he treated him to a modern red-haired Scotch version of\r\n\'Make me a willow cabin at your gate;\' and as he heartily loved Hector\r\nand entirely trusted him, and Blanche\'s pretty head was a wise and\r\nprudent one, what was the use of keeping the poor lad unsettled?\r\n\r\nSo Mrs. Rivers, the eldest sister and the member\'s wife, had come to\r\narrange matters and help Ethel, and a very brilliant wedding it had\r\nbeen.  Blanche was too entirely at home with Hector for flutterings or\r\nagitations, and was too peacefully happy for grief at the separation,\r\nwhich completed the destiny that she had always seen before her.  She\r\nwas a picture of a bride; and when she and Hector hung round the\r\nDoctor, insisting that Edinburgh should be the first place they should\r\nvisit, and calling forth minute directions for their pilgrimage to the\r\nscenes of his youth, promising to come home and tell him all, no wonder\r\nhe felt himself rather gaining a child than losing one.  He was very\r\nbright and happy; and no one but Ethel understood how all the time\r\nthere was a sensation that the present was but a strange dreamy parody\r\nof that marriage which had been the theme of earlier hopes.\r\n\r\nThe wedding had taken place shortly after Easter; and immediately\r\nafter, the Rivers family had departed for London, and Tom May had\r\nreturned to Cambridge, leaving the home party at the minimum of four,\r\nsince, Cocksmoor Parsonage being complete, Richard had become only a\r\ndaily visitor instead of a constant inhabitant.\r\n\r\nThere he sat, occupying his never idle hands with a net that he kept\r\nfor such moments, whilst Ethel sat behind her urn, now giving out its\r\nlast sighs, profiting by the leisure to read the county newspaper,\r\nwhile she continually filled up her cup with tea or milk as occasion\r\nserved, indifferent to the increasing pallor of the liquid.\r\n\r\nMary, a \'fine young woman,\' as George Rivers called her, of blooming\r\nface and sweet open expression, had begun, at Gertrude\'s entreaty, a\r\ngame of French billiards.  Gertrude had still her childish sunny face\r\nand bright hair, and even at the trying age of twelve was pleasing,\r\nchiefly owing to the caressing freedom of manner belonging to an\r\nunspoilable pet.  Her request to Aubrey to join the sport had been\r\nanswered with a half petulant shake of the head, and he flung himself\r\ninto his father\'s chair, his long legs hanging over one arm--an\r\nattitude that those who had ever been under Mrs. May\'s discipline\r\nthought impossible in the drawing-room; but Aubrey was a rival pet, and\r\nwith the family characteristics of aquiline features, dark gray eyes,\r\nand beautiful teeth, had an air of fragility and easy languor that\r\nshowed his exercise of the immunities of ill-health.  He had been\r\nEthel\'s pupil till Tom\'s last year at Eton, when he was sent thither,\r\nand had taken a good place; but his brother\'s vigilant and tender care\r\ncould not save him from an attack on the chest, that settled his\r\npublic-school education for ever, to his severe mortification, just\r\nwhen Tom\'s shower of honours was displaying to him the sweets of\r\nemulation and success.  Ethel regained her pupil, and put forth her\r\nutmost powers for his benefit, causing Tom to examine him at each\r\nvacation, with adjurations to let her know the instant he discovered\r\nthat her task of tuition was getting beyond her.  In truth, Tom\r\nfraternally held her cheap, and would have enjoyed a triumph over her\r\nscholarship; but to this he had not attained, and in spite of his\r\ndesire to keep his brother in a salutary state of humiliation, candour\r\nwrung from him the admission that, even in verses, Aubrey did as well\r\nas other fellows of his standing.\r\n\r\nConceit was not Aubrey\'s fault.  His father was more guarded than in\r\nthe case of his elder sons, and the home atmosphere was not such as to\r\ngive the boy a sense of superiority, especially when diligently kept\r\ndown by his brother.  Even the half year at Eton had not produced\r\nsuperciliousness, though it had given Eton polish to the home-bred\r\nmanners; it had made sisters valuable, and awakened a desire for\r\nmasculine companionship.  He did not rebel against his sister\'s rule;\r\nshe was nearly a mother to him, and had always been the most active\r\npresident of his studies and pursuits; and he was perfectly obedient\r\nand dutiful to her, only asserting his equality, in imitation of Harry\r\nand Tom, by a little of the good-humoured raillery and teasing that\r\ntreated Ethel as the family butt, while she was really the family\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n\'All gone, Ethel,\' he said, with a lazy smile, as Ethel mechanically,\r\nwith her eyes on the newspaper, tried all her vessels round, and found\r\ncream-jug, milk-jug, tea-pot, and urn exhausted; \'will you have in the\r\nriver next?\'\r\n\r\n\'What a shame!\' said Ethel, awakening and laughing.  \'Those are the\r\ntea-maker\'s snares.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do send it away then,\' said Aubrey, \'the urn oppresses the atmosphere.\'\r\n\r\n\'Very well, I\'ll make a fresh brew when papa comes home, and perhaps\r\nyou\'ll have some then.  You did not half finish to-night.\'\r\n\r\nAubrey yawned; and after some speculation about their father\'s absence,\r\nGertrude went to bed; and Aubrey, calling himself tired, stood up,\r\nstretched every limb portentously, and said he should go off too.\r\nEthel looked at him anxiously, felt his hand, and asked if he were sure\r\nhe had not a cold coming on.  \'You are always thinking of colds,\' was\r\nall the satisfaction she received.\r\n\r\n\'What has he been doing?\' said Richard.\r\n\r\n\'That is what I was thinking.  He was about all yesterday afternoon\r\nwith Leonard Ward, and perhaps may have done something imprudent in the\r\ndamp.  I never know what to do.  I can\'t bear him to be a coddle; yet\r\nhe is always catching cold if I let him alone.  The question is,\r\nwhether it is worse for him to run risks, or to be thinking of himself.\'\r\n\r\n\'He need not be doing that,\' said Richard; \'he may be thinking of your\r\nwishes and papa\'s.\'\r\n\r\n\'Very pretty of him and you, Ritchie; but he is not three parts of a\r\nboy or man who thinks of his womankind\'s wishes when there is anything\r\nspirited before him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I suppose one may do one\'s duty without being three parts of a\r\nboy,\' said Richard, gravely.\r\n\r\n\'I know it is true that some of the most saintly characters have been\r\nthe more spiritual because their animal frame was less vigorous; but\r\nstill it does not content me.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, the higher the power, the better, of course, should the service\r\nbe.  I was only putting you in mind that there is compensation.  But I\r\nmust be off.  I am sorry I cannot wait for papa.  Let me know what is\r\nthe matter to-morrow, and how Aubrey is.\'\r\n\r\nRichard went; and the sisters took up their employments--Ethel writing\r\nto the New Zealand sister-in-law her history of the wedding, Mary\r\ncopying parts of a New Zealand letter for her brother, the lieutenant\r\nin command of a gun-boat on the Chinese coast.  Those letters, whether\r\nfrom Norman May or his wife, were very delightful, they were so full of\r\na cheerful tone of trustful exertion and resolution, though there had\r\nbeen perhaps more than the natural amount of disappointments.  Norman\'s\r\npowers were not thought of the description calculated for regular\r\nmission work, and some of the chief aspirations of the young couple had\r\nhad to be relinquished at the voice of authority without a trial.  They\r\nhad received the charge of persons as much in need of them as\r\nunreclaimed savages, but to whom there was less apparent glory in\r\nministering.  A widespread district of very colonial colonists, and the\r\ncharge of a college for their uncultivated sons, was quite as\r\ntroublesome as the most ardent self-devotion could desire; and the\r\nhardships and disagreeables, though severe, made no figure in\r\nhistory--nay, it required ingenuity to gather their existence from\r\nMeta\'s bright letters, although, from Mrs. Arnott\'s accounts, it was\r\nclear that the wife took a quadruple share.  Mrs. Rivers had been heard\r\nto say that Norman need not have gone so far, and sacrificed so much,\r\nto obtain an under-bred English congregation; and even the Doctor had\r\nsighed once or twice at having relinquished his favourite son to what\r\nwas dull and distasteful; but Ethel could trust that this unmurmuring\r\nacceptance of the less striking career, might be another step in the\r\ndiscipline of her brother\'s ardent and ambitious nature.  It is a great\r\nthing to sacrifice, but a greater to consent not to sacrifice in one\'s\r\nown way.\r\n\r\nEthel sat up for her father, and Mary would not go to bed and leave\r\nher, so the two sisters waited till they heard the latch-key.  Ethel\r\nran out, but her father was already on the stairs, and waved her back.\r\n\r\n\'Here is some tea.  Are you not coming, papa?--it is all here.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, I\'ll just go and take off this coat;\' and he passed on to\r\nhis room.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t like that,\' said Ethel, returning to the drawing-room, where\r\nMary was boiling up the kettle, and kneeling down to make some toast.\r\n\r\n\'Why, what\'s the matter?\'\r\n\r\n\'I have never known him go and change his coat but when some infectious\r\nthing has been about.  Besides, he did not wait to let me help him off\r\nwith it.\'\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds the Doctor came down in his dressing-gown, and let\r\nhimself be put into his easy-chair; his two daughters waiting on him\r\nwith fond assiduity, their eyes questioning his fagged weary face, but\r\nreading there fatigue and concern that made them--rather\r\nawe-struck--bide their time till it should suit him to speak.  Mary was\r\nafraid he would wait till she was gone; dear old Mary, who at\r\ntwenty-two never dreamt of regarding herself as on the same footing\r\nwith her three years\' senior, and had her toast been browner, would\r\nhave relieved them of her presence at once.  However, her father spoke\r\nafter his first long draught of tea.\r\n\r\n\'Well!  How true it is that judgments are upon us while we are marrying\r\nand giving in marriage!\'\r\n\r\n\'What is it, papa?  Not the scarlatina?\'\r\n\r\n\'Scarlatina, indeed!\' he said contemptuously.  \'Scarlet fever in the\r\nmost aggravated form.  Two deaths in one house, and I am much mistaken\r\nif there will not be another before morning.\'\r\n\r\n\'Who, papa?\' asked Mary.\r\n\r\n\'Those wretched Martins, in Lower Pond Buildings, are the worst.  No\r\nwonder, living in voluntary filth; but it is all over the street--will\r\nbe all over the town unless there\'s some special mercy on the place.\'\r\n\r\n\'But how has it grown so bad,\' said Ethel, \'without our having even\r\nheard of it!\'\r\n\r\n\'Why--partly I take shame to myself--this business of Hector and\r\nBlanche kept Spencer and me away last dispensary day; and partly it was\r\nthat young coxcomb, Henry Ward, thought it not worth while to trouble\r\nme about a simple epidemic.  Simple epidemic indeed!\' repeated Dr. May,\r\nchanging his tone from ironical mimicry to hot indignation.  \'I hope he\r\nwill be gratified with its simplicity!  I wonder how long he would have\r\ngone on if it had not laid hold on him.\'\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t mean that he has it?\'\r\n\r\n\'I do.  It will give him a practical lesson in simple epidemics.\'\r\n\r\n\'And Henry Ward has it!\' repeated Mary, looking so much dismayed that\r\nher father laughed, saying--\r\n\r\n\'What, Mary thinks when it comes to fevers being so audacious as to lay\r\nhold of the doctors, it is time that they should be put a stop to.\'\r\n\r\n\'He seems to have petted it and made much of it,\' said Ethel; \'so no\r\nwonder!  What could have possessed him?\'\r\n\r\n\'Just this, Ethel; and it is only human nature after all.  This young\r\nlad comes down, as Master Tom will do some day, full of his lectures\r\nand his hospitals, and is nettled and displeased to find his father\r\ncontent to have Spencer or me called in the instant anything serious is\r\nthe matter.\'\r\n\r\n\'But you are a physician, papa,\' said Mary.\r\n\r\n\'No matter for that, to Mr. Henry I\'m an old fogie, and depend upon it,\r\nif it were only the giving a dose of salts, he would like to have the\r\ncase to himself.  These poor creatures were parish patients, and I\r\ndon\'t mean that his treatment was amiss.  Spencer is right, it was an\r\natmosphere where there was no saving anyone, but if he had not been so\r\ndelighted with his own way, and I had known what was going on, I\'d have\r\ngot the Guardians and the Town Council and routed out the place.\r\nSeventeen cases, and most of them the worst form!\'\r\n\r\n\'But what was Mr. Ward about?\r\n\r\n        \'"Says I to myself, here\'s a lesson for me;\r\n          This man\'s but a picture of what I shall be,"\r\n\r\n\'when Master Tom gets the upper hand of me,\' returned Dr. May.  \'Poor\r\nWard, who has run to me in all his difficulties these thirty years,\r\ndidn\'t like it at all; but Mr. Henry was so confident with his simple\r\nepidemic, and had got him in such order, that he durst not speak.\'\r\n\r\n\'And what brought it to light at last?\'\r\n\r\n\'Everything at once.  First the clerics go to see about the family\r\nwhere the infant died, and report to Spencer; he comes after me, and we\r\nstart to reconnoitre.  Then I am called in to see Shearman\'s\r\ndaughter--a very ugly case that--and coming out I meet poor Ward\r\nhimself, wanting me to see Henry, and there\'s the other boy sickening\r\ntoo.  Then I went down and saw all those cases in the Lower Ponds, and\r\nhave been running about the town ever since to try what can be done,\r\nhunting up nurses, whom I can\'t get, stirring dishes of skim milk,\r\ntrying to get the funerals over to-morrow morning by daybreak. I\r\ndeclare I have hardly a leg to stand on.\'\r\n\r\n\'Where was Dr. Spencer?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve nearly quarrelled with Spencer.  Oh! he is in high feather! he\r\nwill have it that the fever rose up bodily, like Kuhleborn, out of that\r\nunhappy drain he is always worrying about, when it is a regular case of\r\nscarlet fever, brought in by a girl at home from service; but he will\r\nhave it that his theory is proved.  Then I meant him to keep clear of\r\nit.  He has always been liable to malaria and all that sort of thing,\r\nand has not strength for an illness.  I told him to mind the ordinary\r\npractice for me; and what do I find him doing the next thing, but\r\noperating upon one of the worst throats he could find!  I told him he\r\nwas as bad as young Ward; I hate his irregular practice. I\'ll tell you\r\nwhat,\' he said, vindictively, as if gratified to have what must obey\r\nhim, \'you shall all go off to Cocksmoor to-morrow morning at seven\r\no\'clock.\'\r\n\r\n\'You forget that we two have had it,\' said Mary.\r\n\r\n\'Which of you?\'\r\n\r\n\'All down to Blanche.\'\r\n\r\n\'Never mind for that.  I shall have enough to do without a sick house\r\nat home.  You can perform quarantine with Richard, and then go to\r\nFlora, if she will have you.  Well, what are you dawdling about?  Go\r\nand pack up.\'\r\n\r\n\'Papa,\' said Ethel, who had been abstracted through all the latter part\r\nof the conversation, \'if you please, we had better not settle my going\r\ntill to-morrow morning.\'\r\n\r\n\'Come, Ethel, you have too much sense for panics.  Don\'t take nonsense\r\ninto your head.  The children can\'t have been in the way of it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Stay, papa,\' said Ethel, her serious face arresting the momentary\r\nimpatience of fatigue and anxiety, \'I am afraid Aubrey was a good while\r\nchoosing fishing-tackle at Shearman\'s yesterday with Leonard Ward; and\r\nit may be nothing, but he did seem heavy and out of order to-night; I\r\nwish you would look at him as you go up.\'\r\n\r\nDr. May stood still for a few moments, then gave one long gasp, made a\r\nfew inquiries, and went up to Aubrey\'s room.  The boy was fast asleep;\r\nbut there was that about him which softened the weary sharpness of his\r\nfather\'s manner, and caused him to desire Ethel to look from the window\r\nwhence she could see whether the lights were out in Dr. Spencer\'s\r\nhouse.  Yes, they were.\r\n\r\n\'Never mind.  It will make no real odds, and he has had enough on his\r\nhands to-day.  The boy will sleep quietly enough to-night, so let us\r\nall go to bed.\'\r\n\r\n\'I think I can get a mattress into his room without waking him, if you\r\nwill help me, Mary,\' said Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'Nonsense,\' said her father, decidedly.  \'Mary is not to go near him\r\nbefore she takes Gertrude to Cocksmoor; and you, go to your own bed and\r\nget a night\'s rest while you can.\'\r\n\r\n\'You won\'t stay up, papa.\'\r\n\r\n\'I--why, it is all I can do not to fall asleep on my feet.  Good night,\r\nchildren.\'\r\n\r\n\'He does not trust himself to think or to fear,\' said Ethel.  \'Too much\r\ndepends on him to let himself be unstrung.\'\r\n\r\n\'But, Ethel, you will not leave, dear Aubrey.\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall keep his door open and mine; but papa is right, and it will\r\nnot do to waste one\'s strength.  In case I should not see you before\r\nyou go--\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, but, Ethel, I shall come back!  Don\'t, pray don\'t tell me to stay\r\naway.  Richard will have to keep away for Daisy\'s sake, and you can\'t\r\ndo all alone--nurse Aubrey and attend to papa.  Say that I may come\r\nback.\'\r\n\r\nWell, Mary, I think you might,\' said Ethel, after a moment\'s thought.\r\n\'If it were only Aubrey, I could manage for him; but I am more anxious\r\nabout papa.\'\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t think he is going to have it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh no, no,\' said Ethel, \'he is what he calls himself, a seasoned\r\nvessel; but he will be terribly overworked, and unhappy, and he must\r\nnot come home and find no one to talk to or to look cheerful.  So,\r\nMary, unless he gives any fresh orders, or Richard thinks it will only\r\nmake things worse, I shall be very glad of you.\'\r\n\r\nMary had never clung to her so gratefully, nor felt so much honoured.\r\n\'Do you think he will have it badly?\' she asked timidly.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think at all about it,\' said Ethel, something in her father\'s\r\nmanner.  \'If we are to get through all this, Mary, it must not be by\r\nriding out on perhapses.  Now let us put Daisy\'s things together, for\r\nshe must have as little communication with home as possible.\'\r\n\r\nEthel silently and rapidly moved about, dreading to give an interval\r\nfor tremblings of heart.  Five years of family prosperity had passed,\r\nand there had been that insensible feeling of peace and immunity from\r\ncare which is strange to look back upon when one hour has drifted from\r\nsmooth water to turbid currents.  There was a sort of awe in seeing the\r\nmysterious gates of sorrow again unclosed; yet, darling of her own as\r\nAubrey was, Ethel\'s first thoughts and fears were primarily for her\r\nfather.  Grief and alarm seemed chiefly to touch her through him, and\r\nshe found herself praying above all that he might be shielded from\r\nsuffering, and might be spared a renewal of the pangs that had before\r\nwrung his heart.\r\n\r\nBy early morning every one was astir; and Gertrude, bewildered and\r\ndistressed, yet rather enjoying the fun of staying with Richard, was\r\nwalking off with Mary.\r\n\r\nSoon after, Dr. Spencer was standing by the bedside of his old patient,\r\nAubrey, who had been always left to his management.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, I see,\' he said, with a certain tone of satisfaction, \'for once\r\nthere will be a case properly treated.  Now, Ethel, you and I will show\r\nwhat intelligent nursing can do.\'\r\n\r\n\'I believe you are delighted,\' growled Aubrey.\r\n\r\n\'So should you be, at the valuable precedent you will afford.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve no notion of being experimented on to prove your theory,\' said\r\nAubrey, still ready for lazy mischief.\r\n\r\nFor be it known that the roving-tempered Dr. Spencer had been on fire\r\nto volunteer to the Crimean hospitals, and had unwillingly sacrificed\r\nthe project, not to Dr. May\'s conviction that it would be fatal in his\r\npresent state of health, but to Ethel\'s private entreaty that he would\r\nnot add to her father\'s distress in the freshness of Margaret\'s death,\r\nand the parting with Norman.  He had never ceased to mourn over the\r\nlost opportunity, and to cast up to his friend the discoveries he might\r\nhave made; while Dr. May declared that if by any strange chance he had\r\ncome back at all, he would have been so rabid on improved nursing and\r\nsanatory measures, that there would have been no living with him.\r\n\r\nIt must be owned that Dr. May was not very sensible to what his friend\r\ncalled Stoneborough stinks.  The place was fairly healthy, and his\r\n\'town councillor\'s conservatism,\' and hatred of change, as well as the\r\namusement of skirmishing, had always made him the champion of things as\r\nthey were; and in the present emergency the battle whether the enemy\r\nhad travelled by infection, or was the product of the Pond Buildings\'\r\nmiasma, was the favourite enlivenment of the disagreeing doctors, in\r\ntheir brief intervals of repose in the stern conflict which they were\r\nwaging with the fever--a conflict in which they had soon to strive by\r\nthemselves, for the disease not only seized on young Ward, but on his\r\nfather; and till medical assistance was sent from London, they had the\r\nwhole town on their hands, and for nearly a week lived without a\r\nnight\'s rest.\r\n\r\nThe care of the sick was a still greater difficulty.  Though Aubrey was\r\nnever in danger, and Dr. Spencer\'s promise of the effects of\r\n\'intelligent nursing\' was fully realized, Ethel and Mary were so\r\noccupied by him, that it was a fearful thing to guess how it must fare\r\nwith those households where the greater number were laid low, and in\r\nwant of all the comforts that could do little.\r\n\r\nThe clergy worked to the utmost; and a letter of Mr. Wilmot\'s obtained\r\nthe assistance of two ladies from a nursing sisterhood, who not only\r\nworked incredible wonders with their own hands among the poor, but made\r\nefficient nurses of rough girls and stupid old women. Dr. May, who had\r\nat first, in his distrust of innovation, been averse to the\r\nimportation--as likely to have no effect but putting nonsense into\r\ngirls\' heads, and worrying the sick poor--was so entirely conquered,\r\nthat he took off his hat to them across the street, importuned them to\r\ndrink tea with his daughters, and never came home without dilating on\r\ntheir merits for the few minutes that intervened between his satisfying\r\nhimself about Aubrey and dropping asleep in his chair.  The only\r\ncounter demonstration he reserved to himself was that he always called\r\nthem \'Miss What-d\'ye-call-her,\' and \'Those gems of women,\' instead of\r\nSister Katherine and Sister Frances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nGood words are silver, but good deeds are gold.--Cecil and Mary\r\n\r\n\r\n\'It has been a very good day, papa; he has enjoyed all his meals,\r\nindeed was quite ravenous.  He is asleep now, and looks as comfortable\r\nas possible,\' said Ethel, five weeks after Aubrey\'s illness had begun.\r\n\r\n\'Thank God for that, and all His mercy to us, Ethel;\' and the long\r\nsigh, the kiss, and dewy eyes, would have told her that there had been\r\nmore to exhaust him than his twelve hours\' toil, even had she not\r\npartly known what weighed him down.\r\n\r\n\'Poor things!\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'Both gone, Ethel, both! both!\' and as he entered the drawing-room, he\r\nthrew himself back in his chair, and gasped with the long-restrained\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\n\'Both!\' she exclaimed.  \'You don\'t mean that Leonard--\'\r\n\r\n\'No, Ethel, his mother!  Poor children, poor children!\'\r\n\r\n\'Mrs. Ward!  I thought she had only been taken ill yesterday evening.\'\r\n\r\n\'She only then gave way--but she never had any constitution--she was\r\ndone up with nursing--nothing to fall back on--sudden collapse and\r\nprostration--and that poor girl, called every way at once, fancied her\r\nasleep, and took no alarm till I came in this morning and found her\r\npulse all but gone.  We have been pouring down stimulants all day, but\r\nthere was no rousing her, and she was gone the first.\'\r\n\r\n\'And Mr. Ward--did he know it?\'\r\n\r\n\'I thought so from the way he looked at me; but speech had long been\r\nlost, and that throat was dreadful suffering.  Well, "In their death\r\nthey were not divided."\'\r\n\r\nHe shaded his eyes with his hand; and Ethel, leaning against his chair,\r\ncould not hinder herself from a shudder at the longing those words\r\nseemed to convey.  He felt her movement, and put his arm round her,\r\nsaying, \'No, Ethel, do not think I envy them.  I might have done so\r\nonce--I had not then learnt the meaning of the discipline of being\r\nwithout her--no, nor what you could do for me, my child, my children.\'\r\n\r\nEthel\'s thrill of bliss was so intense, that it gave her a sense of\r\nselfishness in indulging personal joy at such a moment; and indeed it\r\nwas true that her father had over-lived the first pangs of change and\r\nseparation, had formed new and congenial habits, saw the future hope\r\nbefore him; and since poor Margaret had been at rest, had been without\r\npresent anxiety, or the sight of decay and disappointment. Her only\r\nanswer was a mute smoothing of his bowed shoulders, as she said, \'If I\r\ncould be of any use or comfort to poor Averil Ward, I could go\r\nto-night.  Mary is enough for Aubrey.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not now, my dear.  She can\'t stir from the boy, they are giving him\r\nchampagne every ten minutes; she has the nurse, and Spencer is\r\nbackwards and forwards; I think they will pull him through, but it is a\r\nnear, a very near touch.  Good, patient, unselfish boy he is too.\'\r\n\r\n\'He always was a very nice boy,\' said Ethel; \'I do hope he will get\r\nwell.  It would be a terrible grief to Aubrey.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I got Leonard to open his lips to-day by telling him that Aubrey\r\nhad sent him the grapes.  I think he will get through.  I hope he will.\r\nHe is a good friend for Aubrey.  So touching it was this morning to\r\nhear him trying to ask pardon for all his faults, poor fellow--fits of\r\ntemper, and the like.\'\r\n\r\n\'That is his fault, I believe,\' said Ethel, \'and I always think it a\r\nwholesome one, because it is so visible and unjustifiable, that people\r\nstrive against it.  And the rest?  Was Henry able to see his father or\r\nmother?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, he can scarcely sit up in bed.  It was piteous to see him lying\r\nwith his door open, listening.  He is full of warm sound feeling, poor\r\nfellow.  You would like to have heard the fervour with which he begged\r\nme to tell his father to have no fears for the younger ones, for it\r\nshould be the most precious task of his life to do a parent\'s part by\r\nthem.\'\r\n\r\n\'Let me see, he is just of Harry\'s age,\' said Ethel, thoughtfully, as\r\nif she had not the strongest faith in Harry\'s power of supplying a\r\nparent\'s place.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said her father, \'remember, a medical student is an older man\r\nthan a lieutenant in the navy.  One sees as much of the interior as the\r\nother does of the surface.  We must take this young Ward by the hand,\r\nand mind he does not lose his father\'s practice.  Burdon, that young\r\nprig that Spencer got down from London, met me at Gavin\'s, when I\r\nlooked in there on my way home, and came the length of Minster Street\r\nwith me, asking what I thought of an opening for a medical\r\nman--partnership with young Ward, &c.  I snubbed him so short, that I\r\nfancy I left him thinking whether his nose was on or off his face.\'\r\n\r\n\'He was rather premature.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve settled him any way.  I shall do my best to keep the town clear\r\nfor that lad; there\'s not much more for him, as things are now, and it\r\nwill be only looking close after him for a few years, which Spencer and\r\nI can very well manage.\'\r\n\r\n\'If he will let you.\'\r\n\r\n\'There! that\'s the spitefulness of women!  Must you be casting up that\r\nlittle natural spirit of independence against him after the lesson he\r\nhas had?  I tell you, he has been promising me to look on me as a\r\nfather!  Poor old Ward! he was a good friend and fellow-worker.  I owe\r\na great deal to him.\'\r\n\r\nEthel wondered if he forgot how much of the unserviceableness of his\r\nmaimed arm had once been attributed to Mr. Ward\'s dulness, or how many\r\ntimes he had come home boiling with annoyance at having been called in\r\ntoo late to remedy the respectable apothecary\'s half measures.  She\r\nbelieved that the son had been much better educated than the father,\r\nand after the fearful lesson he had received, thought he might realize\r\nDr. May\'s hopes, and appreciate his kindness.  They discussed the\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n\'Ward came as assistant to old Axworthy, and married his daughter; he\r\nhad no relations that his son knows of, except the old aunt who left\r\nAveril her L2000.\'\r\n\r\n\'There are some Axworthys still,\' said Ethel, \'but not very creditable\r\npeople.\'\r\n\r\n\'You may say that,\' said Dr. May emphatically.  \'There was a scapegrace\r\nbrother that ran away, and was heard of no more till he turned up, a\r\nwealthy man, ten or fifteen years ago, and bought what they call the\r\nVintry Mill, some way on this side of Whitford.  He has a business on a\r\nlarge scale; but Ward had as little intercourse with him as possible.\r\nA terrible old heathen.\'\r\n\r\n\'And the boy that was expelled for bullying Tom is in the business.\'\r\n\r\n\'I hate the thought of that,\' said the Doctor.  \'If he had stayed on,\r\nwho knows but he might have turned out as well as Ned Anderson.\'\r\n\r\n\'Has not he?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure I have no right to say he has not, but he is a flashy slang\r\nstyle of youth, and I hope the young Wards will keep out of his way.\'\r\n\r\n\'What will become of them?  Is there likely to be any provision for\r\nthem?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not much, I should guess.  Poor Ward did as we are all tempted to do\r\nwhen money goes through our hands, and spent more freely than I was\r\never allowed to do.  Costly house, garden, greenhouses--he\'d better\r\nhave stuck to old Axworthy\'s place in Minster Street--daughter at that\r\ngrand school, where she cost more than the whole half-dozen of you put\r\ntogether.\'\r\n\r\n\'She was more worth it,\' said Ethel; \'her music and drawing are\r\nfirst-rate.  Harry was frantic about her singing last time he was at\r\nhome--one evening when Mrs. Anderson abused his good-nature and got him\r\nto a tea-party--I began to be afraid of the consequences.\'\r\n\r\n\'Pish!\' said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\'And really they kept her there to enable her to educate her sisters,\'\r\nsaid Ethel.  \'The last time I called on poor Mrs. Ward, she told me all\r\nabout it, apologizing in the pretty way mothers do, saying she was\r\nlooking forward to Averil\'s coming home, but that while she profited so\r\nmuch, they felt it due to her to give her every advantage; and did not\r\nI think--with my experience--that it was all so much for the little\r\nones\' benefit?  I assured her, from my personal experience, that\r\nignorance is a terrible thing in governessing one\'s sisters.  Poor\r\nthing!  And Averil had only come home this very Easter.\'\r\n\r\n\'And with everything to learn, in such a scene as that!  The first day,\r\nwhen only the boys were ill, there sat the girl, dabbling with her\r\nwater-colours, and her petticoats reaching half across the room,\r\nlooking like a milliner\'s doll, and neither she nor her poor mother\r\ndreaming of her doing a useful matter.\'\r\n\r\n\'Who is spiteful now, papa?  That\'s all envy at not having such an\r\naccomplished daughter.  When she came out in time of need so grandly,\r\nand showed all a woman\'s instinct--\'\r\n\r\n\'Woman\'s nonsense!  Instinct is for irrational brutes, and the more you\r\ncultivate a woman, the less she has of it, unless you work up her\r\npractical common sense too.\'\r\n\r\n\'Some one said she made a wonderful nurse.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wonderful?  Perhaps so, considering her opportunities, and she does\r\nbetter with Spencer than with me; I may have called her to order\r\nimpatiently, for she is nervous with me, loses her head, and knocks\r\neverything down with her petticoats.  Then--not a word to any one,\r\nEthel--but imagine her perfect blindness to her poor mother\'s state all\r\nyesterday, and last night, not even calling Burdon to look at her; why,\r\nthose ten hours may have made all the difference!\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor thing, how is she getting on now?\'\r\n\r\n\'Concentrated upon Leonard, too much stunned to admit another idea--no\r\ntears--hardly full comprehension.  One can\'t take her away, and she\r\ncan\'t bear not to do everything, and yet one can\'t trust her any more\r\nthan a child.\'\r\n\r\n\'As she is,\' said Ethel, \'but as she won\'t be any longer.  And the two\r\nlittle ones?\'\r\n\r\n\'It breaks one\'s heart to see them, just able to sit by their nursery\r\nfire, murmuring in that weary, resigned, sick child\'s voice, \'I wish\r\nnurse would come.\'  \'I wish sister would come.\'  \'I wish mamma would\r\ncome.\'  I went up to them the last thing, and told them how it was, and\r\nlet them cry themselves to sleep.  That was the worst business of all.\r\nEthel, are they too big for Mary to dress some dolls for them?\'\r\n\r\n\'I will try to find out their tastes the first thing to-morrow,\' said\r\nEthel; \'at any rate we can help them, if not poor Averil.\'\r\n\r\nEthel, however, was detained at home to await Dr. Spencer\'s visit, and\r\nMary, whose dreams had all night been haunted by the thought of the two\r\nlittle nursery prisoners, entreated to go with her father, and see what\r\ncould be done for them.\r\n\r\nOff they set together, Mary with a basket in her hand, which was\r\nreplenished at the toy-shop in Minster Street with two china-faced\r\ndolls, and, a little farther on, parted with a couple of rolls,\r\ninterspersed with strata of cold beef and butter, to a household of\r\nconvalescents in the stage for kitchen physic.\r\n\r\nPassing the school, still taking its enforced holiday, the father and\r\ndaughter traversed the bridge and entered the growing suburb known as\r\nBankside, where wretched cottages belonging to needy, grasping\r\nproprietors, formed an uncomfortable contrast to the villa residences\r\ninterspersed among them.\r\n\r\nOne of these, with a well-kept lawn, daintily adorned with the newest\r\npines and ornamental shrubs, and with sheets of glass glaring in the\r\nsun from the gardens at the back, was the house that poor Mr. and Mrs.\r\nWard had bought and beautified; \'because it was so much better for the\r\nchildren to be out of the town.\'  The tears sprang into Mary\'s eyes at\r\nthe veiled windows, and the unfeeling contrast of the spring glow of\r\nflowering thorn, lilac, laburnum, and, above all, the hard, flashing\r\nbrightness of the glass; but tears were so unlike Ethel that Mary\r\nalways was ashamed of them, and disposed of them quietly.\r\n\r\nThey rang, but in vain.  Two of the servants were ill, and all in\r\nconfusion; and after waiting a few moments among the azaleas in the\r\nglass porch, Dr. May admitted himself, and led the way up-stairs with\r\nsilent footfalls, Mary following with breath held back.  A voice from\r\nan open door called, \'Is that Dr. May?\' and he paused to look in and\r\nsay, \'I\'ll be with you in one minute, Henry; how is Leonard?\'\r\n\r\n\'No worse, they tell me; I say, Dr. May--\'\r\n\r\n\'One moment;\' and turning back to Mary, he pointed along a dark\r\npassage.  \'Up there, first door to the right.  You can\'t mistake;\' then\r\ndisappeared, drawing the door after him.\r\n\r\nMuch discomfited, Mary nevertheless plunged bravely on, concluding\r\n\'there\' to be up a narrow, uncarpeted stair, with a nursery wicket at\r\nthe top, in undoing which, she was relieved of all doubts and scruples\r\nby a melancholy little duet from within.  \'Mary, Mary, we want our\r\nbreakfast!  We want to get up!  Mary, Mary, do come! please come!\'\r\n\r\nShe was instantly in what might ordinarily have been a light, cheerful\r\nroom, but which was in all the dreariness of gray cinders, exhausted\r\nnight-light, curtained windows, and fragments of the last meal.  In\r\neach of two cane cribs was sitting up a forlorn child, with loose locks\r\nof dishevelled hair, pale thin cheeks glazed with tears, staring eyes,\r\nand mouths rounded with amaze at the apparition.  One dropped down and\r\nhid under the bed-clothes; the other remained transfixed, as her\r\nvisitor advanced, saying, \'Well, my dear, you called Mary, and here I\r\nam.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not our own Mary,\' said the child, distrustfully.\r\n\r\n\'See if I can\'t be your own Mary.\'\r\n\r\n\'You can\'t.  You can\'t give us our breakfast.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I am so hungry!\' from the other crib; and both burst into the\r\nfeeble sobs of exhaustion.  Recovering from fever, and still fasting at\r\nhalf-past nine!  Mary was aghast, and promised an instant supply.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t go;\' and a bird-like little hand seized her on either side.\r\n\'Mary never came to bed, and nobody has been here all the morning, and\r\nwe can\'t bear to be alone.\'\r\n\r\n\'I was only looking for the bell.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is of no use; Minna did jump out and ring, but nobody will come.\'\r\n\r\nMary made an ineffectual experiment, and then persuaded the children to\r\nlet her go by assurances of a speedy return.  She sped down, brimming\r\nover with pity and indignation, to communicate to her father this cruel\r\nneglect, and as she passed Henry Ward\'s door, and heard several voices,\r\nshe ventured on a timid summons of \'papa,\' but, finding it unheard, she\r\nperceived that she must act for herself. Going down-stairs, she tried\r\nthe sitting-room doors, hoping that breakfast might be laid out there,\r\nbut all were locked; and at last she found her way to the lower\r\nregions, guided by voices in eager tones of subdued gossip.\r\n\r\nThere, in the glow of the huge red fire, stood a well-covered table,\r\nsurrounded by cook, charwoman, and their cavaliers, discussing a pile\r\nof hot-buttered toast, to which the little kitchen-maid was\r\ncontributing large rounds, toasted at the fire.\r\n\r\nMary\'s eyes absolutely flashed, as she said, \'The children have had no\r\nbreakfast.\'\r\n\r\n\'I beg your pardon, ma\'am,\' and the cook rose, \'but it is the\r\nnurse-maid that takes up the young ladies\' meals.\'\r\n\r\nMary did not listen to the rest; she was desperate, and pouncing on the\r\nbread with one hand, and the butter with the other, ran away with them\r\nto the nursery, set them down, and rushed off for another raid. She\r\nfound that the commotion she had excited was resulting in the\r\npreparation of a tray.\r\n\r\n\'I am sure, ma\'am, I am very sorry,\' said the cook, insisting on\r\ncarrying the kettle, \'but we are in such confusion; and the nurse-maid,\r\nwhose place it is, has been up most of the night with Mr. Leonard, and\r\nmust have just dropped asleep somewhere, and I was just giving their\r\nbreakfast to the undertaker\'s young men, but I\'ll call her directly,\r\nma\'am.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, no, on no account.  I am sure she ought to sleep,\' said Mary. \'It\r\nwas only because I found the little girls quite starving that I came\r\ndown.  I will take care of them now.  Don\'t wake her, pray. Only I\r\nhope,\' and Mary looked beseechingly, \'that they will have something\r\ngood for their dinner, poor little things.\'\r\n\r\nCook was entirely pacified, and talked about roast chicken, and\r\npresently the little sisters were sitting up in their beds, each in her\r\nwrapper, being fed by turns with delicately-buttered slices, Mary\r\nstanding between like a mother-bird feeding her young, and pleased to\r\nfind the eyes grow brighter and less hollow, the cheeks less wan, the\r\nvoices less thin and pipy, and a little laugh breaking out when she\r\nmistook Minna for Ella.\r\n\r\nWhile tidying the room, she was assailed with entreaties to call their\r\nMary, and let them get up, they were so tired of bed.  She undertook to\r\nbe still their Mary, and made them direct her to the house-maid\'s\r\nstores, went down on her knees at the embers, and so dealt with\r\nmatches, chips, and coal, that to her own surprise and pride a fire was\r\nevoked.\r\n\r\n\'But,\' said Ella, \'I thought you were a Miss May.\'\r\n\r\n\'So I am, my dear.\'\r\n\r\n\'But ladies don\'t light fires,\' said Minna, in open-eyed perplexity.\r\n\r\n\'Oh,\' exclaimed the younger sister, \'you know Henry said he did not\r\nthink any of the Miss Mays were first-rate, and that our Ave beat them\r\nall to nothing.\'\r\n\r\nThe elder, Minna, began hushing; and it must be confessed that honest\r\nMary was not superior to a certain crimson flush of indignation, as she\r\nheld her head into the grate, and thought of Ethel, Flora, and Blanche,\r\ncriticized by Mr. Henry Ward.  Little ungrateful chit!  No, it was not\r\na matter of laughing, but of forgiveness; and the assertion of the\r\ndignity of usefulness was speedily forgotten in the toilette of the\r\nsmall light skin-and-bone frames, in the course of which she received\r\nsundry compliments--\'her hands were so nice and soft,\' \'she did not\r\npull their hair like their own Mary,\' \'they wished she always dressed\r\nthem.\'\r\n\r\nThe trying moment was when they asked if they might kneel at her lap\r\nfor their prayers.  To Mary, the twelve years seemed as nothing since\r\nher first prayers after the day of terror and bereavement, and her eyes\r\nswam with tears as the younger girl unthinkingly rehearsed her wonted\r\nformula, and the elder, clinging to her, whispered gravely, \'Please,\r\nwhat shall I say?\'\r\n\r\nWith full heart, and voice almost unmanageable, Mary prompted the few\r\nsimple words that had come to her in that hour of sorrow.  She looked\r\nup, from stooping to the child\'s ear, to see her father at the door,\r\ngazing at them with face greatly moved.  The children greeted him\r\nfondly, and he sat down with one on each knee, and caressed them as he\r\nlooked them well over, drawing out their narration of the wonderful\r\nthings \'she\' had done, the fingers pointing to designate who she was.\r\nHis look at her over his spectacles made Mary\'s heart bound and feel\r\ncompensated for whatever Mr. Henry Ward might say of her.  When the\r\nchildren had finished their story, he beckoned her out of the room,\r\npromising them that he would not keep her long.\r\n\r\n\'Well done, Molly,\' he said smiling, \'it is well to have daughters good\r\nfor something.  You had better stay with them till that poor maid has\r\nhad her sleep out, and can come to them.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should like to stay with them all day, only that Ethel must want me.\'\r\n\r\n\'You had better go home by dinner-time, that Ethel may get some air.\r\nPerhaps I shall want one of you in the evening to be with them at the\r\ntime of the funeral.\'\r\n\r\n\'So soon!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, it must be.  Better for all, and Henry is glad it should be so.\r\nHe is out on the sofa to-day, but he is terribly cut up.\'\r\n\r\n\'And Leonard?\'\r\n\r\n\'I see some improvement--Burdon does not--but I think with Heaven\'s\r\ngood mercy we may drag him through; the pulse is rather better.  Now I\r\nmust go.  You\'ll not wait dinner for me.\'\r\n\r\nMary spent the next hour in amusing the children by the fabrication of\r\nthe dolls\' wardrobe, and had made them exceedingly fond of her, so that\r\nthere was a very poor welcome when their own Mary at length appeared,\r\nmuch shocked at the duration of her own slumbers, and greatly obliged\r\nto Miss May.  The little girls would scarcely let Mary go, though she\r\npacified them by an assurance that she or her sister would come in the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t let it be your sister.  You come, and finish our dolls\' frocks!\'\r\nand they hung about her, kissing her, and trying to extract a promise.\r\n\r\nAfter sharing the burthen of depression, it was strange to return home\r\nto so different a tone of spirits when she found Aubrey installed in\r\nEthel\'s room as his parlour, very white and weak, but overflowing with\r\nlanguid fun.  There was grief and sympathy for the poor Wards, and\r\nanxious inquiries for Leonard; but it was not sorrow brought visibly\r\nbefore him, and after the decorous space of commiseration, the smiles\r\nwere bright again, and Mary heard how her father had popped in to boast\r\nof his daughter being \'as good as a house-maid, or as Miss\r\nWhat\'s-her-name;\' and her foray in the kitchen was more diverting to\r\nAubrey than she was as yet prepared to understand.  \'Running away with\r\nthe buttered toast from under the nose of a charwoman! let Harry never\r\ntalk of taking a Chinese battery after that!\' her incapacity of\r\nperceiving that the deed was either valiant or ludicrous, entertaining\r\nhim particularly.  \'It had evidently hit the medium between the sublime\r\nand ridiculous.\'\r\n\r\nWhen evening came, Mary thought it Ethel\'s privilege to go, as the most\r\nefficient friend and comforter; but Ethel saw that her sister\'s soul\r\nwas with the Wards, and insisted that she should go on as she had begun.\r\n\r\n\'O, Ethel, that was only with the little ones.  Now you would be of use\r\nto poor Averil.\'\r\n\r\n\'And why should not you? and of more use?\'\r\n\r\n\'You know I am only good for small children; but if you tell me--\'\r\n\r\n\'You provoking girl,\' said Ethel.  \'All I tell you is, that you are\r\ntwenty-three years old, and I won\'t tell you anything, nor assist your\r\nunwholesome desire to be second fiddle.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know what you mean, Ethel; of course you always tell me what\r\nto do, and how to do it.\'\r\n\r\nEthel quite laughed now, but gave up the contest, only saying, as she\r\nfondly smoothed back a little refractory lock on Mary\'s smooth open\r\nbrow,  \'Very well then, go and do whatever comes to hand at Bankside,\r\nmy dear.  I do really want to stay at home, both on Aubrey\'s account,\r\nand because papa says Dr. Spencer is done up, and that I must catch him\r\nand keep him quiet this evening.\'\r\n\r\nMary was satisfied in her obedience, and set off with her father. Just\r\nas they reached Bankside, a gig drove up containing the fattest old man\r\nshe had ever beheld; her father whispered that it was old Mr. Axworthy,\r\nand sent her at once to the nursery, where she was welcomed with a\r\nlittle shriek of delight, each child bounding in her small arm-chair,\r\nand pulling her down between them on the floor for convenience of\r\ndouble hugging, after which she was required to go on with the\r\ndoll-dressing.\r\n\r\nMary could not bear to do this while the knell was vibrating on her\r\near, and the two coffins being borne across the threshold; so she\r\ngathered the orphans within her embrace as she sat on the floor, and\r\nendeavoured to find out how much they understood of what was passing,\r\nand whether they had any of the right thoughts.  It was rather\r\ndisappointing.  The little sisters had evidently been well and\r\nreligiously taught, but they were too childish to dwell on thoughts of\r\nawe or grief, and the small minds were chiefly fixed upon the dolls, as\r\nthe one bright spot in the dreary day.  Mary yielded, and worked and\r\nanswered their chatter till twilight came on, and the rival Mary came\r\nup to put them to bed, an operation in which she gave her assistance,\r\nalmost questioning if she were not forgotten, but she learnt that her\r\nfather was still in the house, the nurse believed looking at papers in\r\nMr. Henry\'s room with the other gentlemen.\r\n\r\n\'And you will sit by us while we go to sleep.  Oh! don\'t go away!\'\r\n\r\nThe nurse was thankful to her for so doing, and a somewhat graver mood\r\nhad come over Minna as she laid her head on her pillow, for she asked\r\nthe difficult question, \'Can mamma see us now?\' which Mary could only\r\nanswer with a tender \'Perhaps,\' and an attempt to direct the child to\r\nthe thought of the Heavenly Father; and then Minna asked, \'Who will\r\ntake care of us now?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, will you?\' cried Ella, sitting up; and both little maids, holding\r\nout their arms, made a proffer of themselves to be her little children.\r\nThey would be so good if she would let them be--\r\n\r\nMary could only fondle and smile it off, and put them in mind that they\r\nbelonged to their brother and sister; but the answer was, \'Ave is not\r\nso nice as you.  Oh, do let us--\'\r\n\r\n\'But I can\'t, my dears.  I am Dr. May\'s child, you know.  What could I\r\nsay to him?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! but Dr. May wouldn\'t mind!  I know he wouldn\'t mind!  Mamma says\r\nthere was never any one so fond of little children, and he is such a\r\ndear good old gentleman.\'\r\n\r\nMary had not recognized him as an old gentleman at fifty-eight, and did\r\nnot like it at all.  She argued on the impracticability of taking them\r\nfrom their natural protectors, and again tried to lead them upwards,\r\nfinally betaking herself to the repetition of hymns, which put them to\r\nsleep.  She had spent some time in sitting between them in the summer\r\ndarkness, when there was a low tap, and opening the door, she saw her\r\nfather.  Indicating that they slept, she followed him out, and a\r\nwhispered conference took place as he stood below her on the stairs,\r\ntheir heads on a level.\r\n\r\n\'Tired, Mary?  I have only just got rid of old Axworthy.\'\r\n\r\n\'The nurse said you were busy with papers in Henry\'s room.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ay--the Will.  Henry behaves very well; and is full of right feeling,\r\npoor fellow!\'\r\n\r\n\'What becomes of those dear little girls?  They want to make themselves\r\na present to me, and say they know you would like it.\'\r\n\r\n\'So I should, the darlings!  Well, as things are left, it all goes to\r\nHenry, except the L10,000 Ward had insured his life for, which divides\r\nbetween the five.  He undertakes, most properly, to make them a\r\nhome--whether in this house or not is another thing; he and Averil will\r\nlook after them; and he made a most right answer when Mr. Axworthy\r\noffered to take Leonard into his office,\' proceeded the communicative\r\nDoctor, unable to help pouring himself out, in spite of time and place,\r\nas soon as he had a daughter to himself.  \'Settle nothing\r\nnow--education not finished; but privately he tells me he believes his\r\nmother would as soon have sent Leonard to the hulks as to that old\r\nrascal, and the scamp, his grand-nephew.\'\r\n\r\nMary\'s answer to this, as his tones became incautiously emphatic, was a\r\nglance round all the attic doors, lest they should have ears.\r\n\r\n\'Now then, do you want to get home?\' said the Doctor, a little rebuked.\r\n\r\n\'Oh no, not if there is anything I can do.\'\r\n\r\n\'I want to get this girl away from Leonard.  He is just come to the\r\nstate when it all turns on getting him off to sleep quietly, and not\r\ndisturbing him, and she is too excited and restless to do anything with\r\nher; she has startled him twice already, and then gets upset--tired\r\nout, poor thing! and will end in being hysterical if she does not get\r\nfed and rested, and then we shall be done for!  Now I want you to take\r\ncharge of her.  See, here\'s her room, and I have ordered up some tea\r\nfor her.  You must get her quieted down, make her have a tolerable\r\nmeal, and when she has worked off her excitement, put her to\r\nbed--undressed, mind--and you might lie down by her.  If you can\'t\r\nmanage her, call me.  That\'s Leonard\'s door, and I shall be there all\r\nnight; but don\'t if you can help it.  Can you do this, or must I get\r\nMiss "What-d\'ye-call-her" the elder one, if she can leave the Greens in\r\nRandall\'s Alley?\r\n\r\nWell was it that Mary\'s heart was stout as well as tender; and instead\r\nof mentally magnifying the task, and diminishing her own capabilities,\r\nshe simply felt that she had received a command, and merely asked that\r\nEthel should be informed.\r\n\r\n\'I am going to send up to her.\'\r\n\r\n\'And shall I give Averil anything to take?\'\r\n\r\n\'Mutton-chops, if you can.\'\r\n\r\n\'I meant sal-volatile, or anything to put her to sleep.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nonsense!  I hate healthy girls drugging themselves.  You don\'t do\r\nthat at home, Mary!\'\r\n\r\nMary showed her white teeth in a silent laugh at the improbability,\r\nthere being nothing Ethel more detested than what she rather rudely\r\ncalled nervous quackeries.  Her father gave her a kiss of grateful\r\napprobation, and was gone.\r\n\r\nThere was a light on the table, and preparations for tea; and Mary\r\nlooked round the pretty room, where the ornamental paper, the flowery\r\nchintz furniture, the shining brass of the bedstead, the frilled muslin\r\ntoilet, and et ceteras, were more luxurious than what she ever saw,\r\nexcept when visiting with Flora, and so new as to tell a tale of the\r\nmother\'s fond preparation for the return of the daughter from school.\r\nIn a few moments she heard her father saying, in a voice as if speaking\r\nto a sick child, \'Yes, I promise you, my dear.  Be good, be reasonable,\r\nand you shall come back in the morning.  No, you can\'t go there.  Henry\r\nis going to bed.  Here is a friend for you.  Now, Mary, don\'t let me\r\nsee her till she has slept.\'\r\n\r\nMary took the other hand, and between them they placed her in an\r\narm-chair, whose shining fresh white ground and gay rose-pattern\r\ncontrasted with her heated, rumpled, over-watched appearance, as she\r\nsank her head on her hand, not noticing either Mary\'s presence or the\r\nDoctor\'s departure.  Mary stood doubtful for a few seconds, full of\r\npity and embarrassment, trying to take in the needs of the case.\r\n\r\nAveril Ward was naturally a plump, well-looking girl of eighteen, with\r\nclearly-cut features, healthy highly-coloured complexion, and large\r\nbright hazel eyes, much darker than her profuse and glossy hair, which\r\nwas always dressed in the newest and most stylish fashion, which, as\r\nwell as the whole air of her dress and person, was, though perfectly\r\nlady like, always regarded by the Stoneborough world as something on\r\nthe borders of presumption on the part of the entire Ward family.\r\n\r\nTo Mary\'s surprise, the five weeks\' terrible visitation, and these last\r\nfearful five days of sleepless exertion and bereavement, had not faded\r\nthe bright red of the cheek, nor were there signs of tears, though the\r\neyes looked bloodshot.  Indeed, there was a purple tint about the\r\neyelids and lips, a dried-up appearance, and a heated oppressed air, as\r\nif the faculties were deadened and burnt up, though her hand was cold\r\nand trembling.  Her hair, still in its elaborate arrangement, hung\r\nloose, untidy, untouched; her collar and sleeves were soiled and\r\ntumbled; her dress, with its inconvenient machinery of inflation,\r\nlooked wretched from its incongruity, and the stains on the huge\r\nhanging sleeves.  Not a moment could have been given to the care of her\r\nown person, since the sole burthen of nursing had so grievously and\r\nsuddenly descended on her.\r\n\r\nMary\'s first instinct was to pour out some warm water, and bringing it\r\nwith a sponge, to say, \'Would not this refresh you?\'\r\n\r\nAveril moved petulantly; but the soft warm stream was so grateful to\r\nher burning brow, that she could not resist; she put her head back, and\r\nsubmitted like a child to have her face bathed, saying, \'Thank you.\'\r\n\r\nMary then begged to remove her tight heavy dress, and make her\r\ncomfortable in her dressing-gown.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I can\'t!  Then I could not go back.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, you could; this is quite a dress; besides, one can move so much\r\nmore quietly without crinoline.\'\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t think of that;\' and she stood up, and unfastened her hooks.\r\n\'Perhaps Dr. May would let me go back now!\' as a mountain of mohair and\r\nscarlet petticoat remained on the floor, upborne by an over-grown steel\r\nmouse-trap.\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps he will by and by; but he said you must sleep first.\'\r\n\r\n\'Sleep--I can\'t sleep.  There\'s no one but me.  I couldn\'t sleep.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then at least let me try to freshen you up.  There.  You don\'t know\r\nwhat good it used to do my sister Blanche, for me to brush her hair. I\r\nlike it.\'\r\n\r\nAnd Mary obtained a dreamy soothed submission, so that she almost\r\nthought she was brushing her victim to sleep in her chair, before the\r\nmaid came up with the viands that Dr. May had ordered.\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t eat that,\' said Averil, with almost disgust.  \'Take it away.\'\r\n\r\n\'Please don\'t,\' said Mary.  \'Is that the way you use me, Miss Ward,\r\nwhen I come to drink tea with you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I beg your pardon,\' was the mechanical answer.\r\n\r\nMary having made the long hair glossy once more, into a huge braid, and\r\nknotted it up, came forth, and insisted that they were to be\r\ncomfortable over their grilled chickens\' legs.  She was obliged to make\r\nher own welcome, and entertain her hostess; and strenuously she worked,\r\nletting the dry lips imbibe a cup of tea, before she attempted the\r\nsolids; then coaxing and commanding, she gained her point, and\r\nsucceeded in causing a fair amount of provisions to be swallowed; after\r\nwhich Averil seemed more inclined to linger in enjoyment of the\r\nliquids, as though the feverish restlessness were giving place to a\r\nsense of fatigue and need of repose.\r\n\r\n\'This is all wrong,\' said she, with a faint bewildered smile, as Mary\r\nfilled up her cup for her.  \'I ought to be treating you as guest, Miss\r\nMay.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, don\'t call me Miss May!  Call me Mary.  Think me a sister.  You\r\nknow I have known something of like trouble, only I was younger, and I\r\nhad my sisters.\'\r\n\r\n\'I do not seem to have felt anything yet,\' said Averil, passing her\r\nhands over her face.  \'I seem to be made of stone.\'\r\n\r\n\'You have done: and that is better than feeling.\'\r\n\r\n\'Done! and how miserably!  Oh, the difference it might have made, if I\r\nhad been a better nurse!\'\r\n\r\n\'Papa and Dr. Spencer both say you have been a wonderful nurse,\r\nconsidering--\' the last word came out before Mary was aware.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Dr. May has been so kind and so patient with me, I shall never\r\nforget it.  Even when I scalded his fingers with bringing him that\r\nboiling water--but I always do wrong when he is there--and now he won\'t\r\nlet me go back to Leonard.\'\r\n\r\n\'But, Averil, the best nurse in the world can\'t hold out for ever.\r\nPeople must sleep, and make themselves fit to go on.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not when there is only one:\' and she gasped.\r\n\r\n\'All the more reason, when there is but one.  Perhaps it is because you\r\nare tired out that you get nervous and agitated.  You will be quite\r\ndifferent after a rest.\'\r\n\r\n\'Are you sure?\' whispered Averil, with her eyes rounded, \'are you sure\r\nthat is all the reason?\'\r\n\r\n\'What do you mean?\' said Mary.\r\n\r\nAveril drew in her breath, and squeezed both hands tight on her chest,\r\nas she spoke very low: \'They sent me away from mamma--they told me papa\r\nwanted me: then they sent me from him; they said I was better with\r\nLeonard; and--and I said to myself, nothing should make me leave\r\nLeonard.\'\r\n\r\n\'It was not papa--my father--that sent you without telling you,\' said\r\nMary, confidently.\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said Averil.\r\n\r\n\'No; I have heard him say that he would take all risks, rather than\r\ndeceive anybody,\' said Mary, eagerly.  \'I have heard him and Dr.\r\nSpencer argue about what they called pious frauds, and he always said\r\nthey were want of faith.  You may trust him.  He told me Leonard was in\r\nthe state when calm sleep was chiefly wanted.  I know he would think it\r\ncruel not to call you if there were need; and I do not believe there\r\nwill be need.\'\r\n\r\nSomething like this was reiterated in different forms; and though\r\nAveril never regularly yielded, yet as they sat on, there came pauses\r\nin the conversation, when Mary saw her nodding, and after one or two\r\nvibrations in her chair, she looked up with lustreless glassy eyes.\r\nMary took one of these semi-wakened moments, and in the tone of\r\ncaressing authority that had been already found effectual, said she\r\nmust sleep in bed; took no notice of the murmur of refusal, but\r\ncompleted the undressing, and fairly deposited her in her bed.\r\n\r\nMary\'s scrupulous conscience was distressed at having thus led to the\r\nomission of all evening orisons; but if her own simple-hearted loving\r\nsupplications at the orphan\'s bedside could compensate for their\r\nabsence, she did her utmost.  Then, as both the room-door and that of\r\nthe sick-chamber had been left open, she stole into the passage, where\r\nshe could see her father, seated at the table, and telegraphed to him a\r\nsign of her success.  He durst not move, but he smiled and nodded\r\nsatisfaction; and Mary, after tidying the room, and considering with\r\nherself, took off her more cumbrous garments, wrapped herself in a\r\ncloak, and lay down beside Averil, not expecting to sleep, but passing\r\nto thoughts of Harry, and of that 23rd Psalm, which they had agreed to\r\nsay at the same hour every night.  By how many hours was Harry\r\nbeforehand with her?  That was a calculation that to Mary was always\r\nlike the beads of the chaplain of Norham Castle.  Certain it is, that\r\nafter she had seen Harry lighting a fire to broil chickens\' legs in a\r\nChinese temple, under the willow-pattern cannon-ball tree, and heard\r\nHenry Ward saying it was not like a lieutenant in the navy, she found\r\nherself replying, \'Use before gentility;\' and in the enunciation of\r\nthis--her first moral sentiment--discovered that it was broad daylight.\r\n\r\nWhat o\'clock it was she could not guess.  Averil was sound asleep,\r\nbreathing deeply and regularly, so that it was; a pleasure to listen to\r\nher; and Mary did not fear wakening her by a shoeless voyage of\r\ndiscovery to the place whence Dr. May was visible.\r\n\r\nHe turned at once, and with his noiseless tread came to her.  \'Asleep\r\nstill?  So is he.  All right.  Here, waken me the moment he stirs.\'\r\n\r\nAnd rather by sign than word, he took Mary into the sickroom, indicated\r\na chair, and laid himself on a sofa, where he was instantaneously sound\r\nasleep, before his startled daughter had quite taken everything in; but\r\nshe had only to glance at his haggard wearied face, to be glad to be\r\nthere, so as to afford him even a few moments of vigorous slumber with\r\nall his might.\r\n\r\nIn some awe, she looked round, not venturing to stir hand or foot. Her\r\nchair was in the full draught of the dewy morning breeze, so chilly,\r\nthat she drew her shawl tightly about her; but she knew that this had\r\nbeen an instance of her father\'s care, and if she wished to make the\r\nslightest move, it was only to secure a fuller view of the patient,\r\nfrom whom she was half cut off by a curtain at the foot of the bed.  A\r\nsort of dread, however, made Mary gaze at everything around her before\r\nshe brought her eyes upon him--her father\'s watch on the table,\r\nindicating ten minutes to four, the Minster Tower in the rising\r\nsunlight--nay, the very furniture of the room, and Dr. May\'s position,\r\nbefore she durst familiarize herself with Leonard\'s appearance--he whom\r\nshe had last seen as a sturdy, ruddy, healthful boy, looking able to\r\noutweigh two of his friend Aubrey.\r\n\r\nThe original disease had long since passed into typhus, and the scarlet\r\neruption was gone, so that she only saw a yellow whiteness, that,\r\nmarked by the blue veins of the bared temples, was to her mind\r\ndeath-like.  Mary had not been sheltered from taking part in scenes of\r\nsuffering; she had seen sickness and death in cottages, as well as in\r\nher own home, and she had none of the fanciful alarms, either of\r\nnovelty or imagination, to startle her in the strange watch that had so\r\nsuddenly been thrust on her but what did fill her with a certain\r\napprehension, was the new and lofty beauty of expression that sat on\r\nthat sleeping countenance.  \'A nice boy,\' \'rather a handsome lad,\' \'a\r\nboy of ingenuous face,\' they had always called Leonard Ward, when\r\nanimated with health and spirits; and the friendship between him and\r\nAubrey had been encouraged, but without thinking of him as more than an\r\nordinary lad of good style.  Now, however, to Mary\'s mind, the broad\r\nbrow and wasted features in their rest had assumed a calm nobility that\r\nwas like those of Ethel\'s favourite champions--those who conquered by\r\n\'suffering and being strong.\'  She looked and listened for the low\r\nregular breath, almost doubting at one moment whether it still were\r\ndrawn, then only reassured by its freedom and absence from effort, that\r\nit was not soon to pass away.  There was something in that look as if\r\ndeath must set his seal on it, rather than as if it could return to the\r\nflush of health, and the struggle and strife of school-boy life and of\r\nmanhood.\r\n\r\nMore than an hour had passed, and all within the house was as still as\r\never; and through the window there only came such sounds as seem like\r\naudible silence--the twittering of birds, the humming of bees, the\r\ncalls of boys in distant fields, the far-away sound of\r\nwaggon-wheels--when there was a slight move, and Mary, in the tension\r\nof all her faculties, had well-nigh started, but restrained herself;\r\nand as she saw the half-closed fingers stretch, and the head turn, she\r\nleant forward, and touched her father\'s hand.\r\n\r\nDr. May was on his feet even before those brown eyes of Leonard\'s had\r\nhad time to unclose; and as Mary was silently moving to the door, he\r\nmade a sign to her to wait.\r\n\r\nShe stood behind the curtain.  \'You are better for your sleep.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, thank you--much better.\'\r\n\r\nThe Doctor signed towards a tray, which stood by a spirit-lamp, on a\r\ntable in the further corner.  Mary silently brought it, and as quietly\r\nobeyed the finger that directed her to cordial and spoon--well knowing\r\nthe need--since that unserviceable right arm always made these\r\noperations troublesome to her father.\r\n\r\n\'Have you been here all night, Dr. May?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; and very glad to see you sleeping so well.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you.\'  And there was something that made Mary\'s eyes dazzle with\r\ntears in the tone of that \'Thank you.\'  The Doctor held out his hand\r\nfor the spoon she had prepared, and there was another \'Thank you;\'\r\nthen, \'Is Ave there?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, I made her go to bed.  She is quite well; but she wanted sleep\r\nsorely.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you,\' again said the boy; then with a moment\'s pause, \'Dr. May,\r\ntell me now.\'\r\n\r\nMary would have fled as breaking treacherously in upon such tidings;\r\nbut a constraining gesture of her father obliged her to remain, and\r\nkeep the cordial ready for immediate administration.\r\n\r\n\'My dear, I believe you know,\' said Dr. May, bending over him--and Mary\r\nwell knew what the face must be saying.\r\n\r\n\'Both?\' the faint tones asked.\r\n\r\n\'Recollect the sorrow that they have been spared,\' said Dr. May in his\r\nlowest, tenderest tones, putting his hand out behind him, and signing\r\nto Mary for the cordial.\r\n\r\n\'She could not have borne it;\' and the feebleness of those words made\r\nMary eager to put the spoon once more into her father\'s hands.\r\n\r\n\'That is right, my boy.  Think of their being together;\' and Mary heard\r\ntears in her father\'s voice.\r\n\r\n\'Thank you,\' again showed that the cordial was swallowed; then a pause,\r\nand in a quiet, sad, low tone, \'Poor Ave!\'\r\n\r\n\'Your mending is the best thing for her.\'\r\n\r\nThen came a long sigh; and then, after a pause, the Doctor knelt down,\r\nand said the Lord\'s Prayer--the orphan\'s prayer, as so many have felt\r\nit in the hour of bereavement.\r\n\r\nAll was quite still, and both he and Mary knelt on for some short\r\nspace; then he arose in guarded stillness, hastily wiped away the tears\r\nthat were streaming over his face, and holding back the curtain, showed\r\nMary the boy, again sunk into that sweet refreshing sleep.  \'That is\r\nwell over,\' he said, with a deep sigh of relief, when they had moved to\r\na safe distance.  \'Poor fellow! he had better become used to the idea\r\nwhile he is too weak to think.\'\r\n\r\n\'He is better?\' asked Mary, repressing her agitation with difficulty.\r\n\r\n\'I believe the danger is over; and you may tell his sister so when she\r\nwakes.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n  And a heart at leisure from itself\r\n  To soothe and sympathize.--Miss Waring\r\n\r\n\r\nRecovery had fairly set in, and \'better\' was the universal bulletin,\r\neating and drinking the prevailing remedy.\r\n\r\nHenry Ward had quickly thrown off his illness.  The sense that all\r\ndepended on him, acted as a stimulus to his energies; he was anxious to\r\nbe up and doing, and in a few days was down-stairs, looking over his\r\nfather\'s papers, and making arrangements.  He was eager and confident,\r\ndeclaring that his sisters should never want a home while he lived;\r\nand, when he first entered his brother\'s room, his effusion of\r\naffection overwhelmed Leonard in his exceeding weakness, and the\r\nthought of which during the rest of the day often brought tears to his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nVery grateful to Dr. May, Henry declared himself anxious to abide by\r\nhis advice; and discussed with him all his plans.  There had been no\r\nwill, but the house and land of course were Henry\'s.  The other\r\nproperty gave about L2000 to each of the family; and Averil had about\r\nas much again from the old aunt, from whom she had taken her peculiar\r\nname.  The home of all should, of course, still be their present one;\r\nAveril would teach her sisters, and superintend the house, and Leonard\r\ncontinue at the school, where he had a fair chance of obtaining the\r\nRandall scholarship in the course of a year or two. \'And if not,\' said\r\nHenry, \'he may still not lose his University education.  My father was\r\nproud of Leonard; and if he would have sent him there, why should not\r\nI?\'\r\n\r\nAnd when Dr. May thought how his own elder sons had insisted on greater\r\nadvantages of education for their juniors than they had themselves\r\nenjoyed, he felt especially fatherly towards the young surgeon.  On\r\nonly one point was he dissatisfied, and that he could not press.  He\r\nthought the establishment at Bankside too expensive, and counselled\r\nHenry to remove into the town, and let the house; but this was rejected\r\non the argument of the uncertainty of finding a tenant, and the\r\ninexpediency of appearing less prosperous; and considering that Mr. and\r\nMrs. Ward had themselves made the place, Dr. May thought his proposal\r\nhard-hearted.  He went about impressing every one with his confidence\r\nin Henry Ward, and fought successfully at the Board of Guardians to\r\nhave him considered as a continuation of his father, instead of\r\nappointing a new union doctor; and he watched with paternal solicitude\r\nthat the young man\'s first return to his practice should be neither too\r\nsoon for his own health or his patients\' fears; giving him no\r\nexhortation more earnest, nor more thankfully accepted, than that he\r\nwas to let no scruple prevent his applying to himself in the slightest\r\ndifficulty; calling him in to pauper patients, and privately consulting\r\nin cases which could not be visited gratis.  The patronage of Henry\r\nWard was one of the hobbies that Dr. May specially loved, and he\r\ncantered off upon it with vehemence such as he had hardly displayed for\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAubrey recovered with the tardiness of a weakly constitution, and was\r\nlong in even arriving at a drive in the brougham; for Dr. May had set\r\nup a brougham.  As long as Hector Ernescliffe\'s home was at\r\nStoneborough, driving the Doctor had been his privilege, and the old\r\ngig had been held together by diligent repairs; but when Maplewood\r\nclaimed him, and Adams was laid aside by rheumatism, Flora would no\r\nlonger be silenced, and preached respectability and necessity.  Dr. May\r\ndid not admit the plea, unless Adams were to sit inside and drive out\r\nof window; but then he was told of the impropriety of his daughters\r\ngoing out to dinner in gigs, and the expense of flies. When Flora\r\ntalked of propriety in that voice, the family might protest and\r\ngrumble, but were always reduced to obedience; and thus Blanche\'s\r\nwedding had been the occasion of Ethel being put into a hoop, and the\r\nDoctor into a brougham.  He was better off under the tyranny than she\r\nwas, in spite of the solitude he had bewailed. Young Adams was not the\r\ncompanion his father had been, and was no loss; and he owned that he\r\nnow got through a great deal of reading, and at times a great deal of\r\nsleep; and mourned for nothing but his moon and stars--so romantic a\r\nregret, that Dr. Spencer advised him not to mention it.\r\n\r\nAfter Aubrey\'s first drives, Dr. Spencer declared that the best way of\r\ninvigorating him would be to send him for a month to the sea-side,\r\nwhile the house could be thoroughly purified before Gertrude\'s return.\r\nDr. Spencer and Mary would take care of Dr. May; and Ethel had begun to\r\nlook forward to a tete-a-tete with Aubrey by the sea, which they had\r\nneither of them ever seen, when her anticipations were somewhat dashed\r\nby her father\'s exclaiming, that it would be the best thing for Leonard\r\nWard to go with them.  She said something about his not being well\r\nenough to travel so soon.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, yes, he will,\' said Dr. May; \'he only wants stimulus to get on\r\nfast enough.  I declare I\'ll ask Henry about it; I\'m just going to meet\r\nhim at the hospital.\'\r\n\r\nAnd before another word could be said, he let himself out at the back\r\ndoor of the garden, in which they had been meeting Richard, who was now\r\nallowed to come thus far, though both for Daisy\'s sake and his flock\'s,\r\nhe had hitherto submitted to a rigorous quarantine; and the entire\r\nimmunity of Cocksmoor from the malady was constantly adduced by each\r\ndoctor as a convincing proof of his own theory.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I do hope that will go off!\' exclaimed Ethel, as soon as her\r\nfather was out of hearing.  \'It will be a terrible upset to all one\'s\r\npeace and comfort with Aubrey!\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed--what harm will the poor boy do?\' asked Richard.\r\n\r\n\'Make Aubrey into the mere shame-faced, sister-hating, commonplace\r\ncreature that the collective boy thinks it due to himself to be in\r\nsociety,\' said Ethel, \'and me from an enjoying sister, into an elderly,\r\ncare-taking, despised spinster--a burden to myself and the boys.\'\r\n\r\n\'But why, Ethel, can\'t you enjoy yourself!\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear Richard, just imagine turning loose a lot of boys and girls,\r\nwith no keeper, to enjoy themselves in some wild sea place!  No, no:\r\nthe only way to give the arrangement any shade of propriety, will be to\r\nbe elderly, infuse as much vinegar as possible into my countenance,\r\nwear my spectacles, and walk at a staid pace up and down the parade,\r\nwhile my two sons disport themselves on the rocks.\'\r\n\r\n\'If you really think it would not be proper,\' said Richard, rather\r\nalarmed, \'I could run after my father.\'\r\n\r\n\'Stuff, Richard; papa must have his way; and if it is to do the boy\r\ngood, I can sacrifice a crab--I mean myself--not a crustacean.  I am\r\nnot going to be such a selfish wretch as to make objections.\'\r\n\r\n\'But if it would not be the correct thing?  Or could not you get some\r\none to stay with you?\'\r\n\r\n\'I can make it the correct thing.  It is only to abstain from the fun I\r\nhad hoped for.  I meant to have been a girl, and now I must be a woman,\r\nthat\'s all; and I dare say Aubrey will be the happier for it--boys\r\nalways are.\'\r\n\r\n\'If you don\'t like it, I wish you would let me speak to papa.\'\r\n\r\n\'Richard, have you these five years been the safety-valve for my\r\nmurmurs without knowing what they amount to?\'\r\n\r\n\'I thought no one complained unless to get a thing remedied.\'\r\n\r\n\'Exactly so.  That is man!  And experience never shows man that woman\'s\r\ngrowls relieve her soul, and that she dreads nothing more than their\r\nbeing acted on!  All I wish is, that this scheme may die a natural\r\ndeath; but I should be miserable, and deserved to be so, if I raised a\r\nfinger to hinder it.  What, must you go?  Rule Daisy\'s lines if she\r\nwrites to Meta, please.\'\r\n\r\n\'I did so.  I have been trying to make her write straighter.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course you have.  I expect I shall find her organ of order grown to\r\na huge bump when she comes home.  Oh! when will our poor remnants be\r\nonce more a united family? and when shall I get into Cocksmoor school\r\nagain?\'\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. May came home, his plan was in full bloom.  Henry had\r\ngratefully accepted it, and answered for his brother being able to\r\ntravel by the next Monday; and Dr. May wanted Ethel to walk with him to\r\nBankside, and propose it there--talking it over with the sister, and\r\nmaking it her own invitation.  Ethel saw her fate, and complied, her\r\nfather talking eagerly all the way.\r\n\r\n\'You see, Ethel, it is quite as much for his spirits as his health that\r\nI wish it.  He is just the age that our Norman was.\'\r\n\r\nThat was the key to a great deal.  Ethel knew that her father had never\r\nadmitted any of the many excuses for the neglect of Norman\'s suffering\r\nfor the three months after his mother\'s death; but though it thrilled\r\nher all over, she was not prepared to believe that any one, far less\r\nany Ward, could be of the same sensitive materials as Norman.  To avoid\r\nanswering, she went more than half-way, by saying, \'Don\'t you think I\r\nmight ask those poor girls to come with him?\'\r\n\r\n\'By no manner of means,\' said the Doctor, stopping short.  \'It is just\r\nwhat I want, to get him away from his sister.  She minds nothing else;\r\nand if it were not for Mary, I don\'t know what the little ones would\r\ndo; and as to Henry, he is very good and patient; but it is the way to\r\nprevent him from forming domestic tastes to have no mistress to his\r\nhouse.  He will get into mischief, or marry, if she does not mind what\r\nshe is about.\'\r\n\r\n\'That must come to an end when Leonard is well, and goes back to\r\nschool.\'\r\n\r\n\'And that won\'t be till after the holidays.  No, some break there must\r\nbe.  When he is gone, Mary can put her into the way of doing things;\r\nshe is anxious to do right; and we shall see them do very well.  But\r\nthis poor boy--you know he has been always living at home, while the\r\nothers were away; he was very fond of his mother, and the first coming\r\nout of his room was more than he could bear.  I must have him taken\r\nfrom home till he is well again, and able to turn to other things.\'\r\n\r\nAnd before Ethel\'s eyes came a vision of poor Mrs. Ward leaning on her\r\nson\'s arm, on Saturday afternoon walks, each looking fond and proud of\r\nthe other.  She felt her own hardness of heart, and warmed to the\r\ndesire of giving comfort.\r\n\r\nBankside was basking in summer sunshine, with small patches of shade\r\nround its young shrubs and trees, and a baking heat on the little porch.\r\n\r\nThe maid believed Miss Ward was in the garden.  Mr. Leonard had been\r\ntaken out to-day; and the Doctor moving on, they found themselves in\r\nthe cool pretty drawing-room, rather overcrowded with furniture and\r\ndecoration, fresh and tasteful, but too much of it, and a contrast to\r\nthe Mays\' mixture of the shabby and the curious, in the room that was\r\nso decidedly for use, and not for show.\r\n\r\nWhat arrested the attention was, however, the very sweetest singing\r\nEthel had ever heard.  The song was low and sad, but so intensely\r\nsweet, that Dr. May held up his hand to silence all sound, and stood\r\nwith restrained breath and moistened eyes.  Ethel, far less sensitive\r\nto music, was nevertheless touched as she had never before been by\r\nsound; and the more, as she looked through the window and saw in the\r\nshade of a walnut-tree, a sofa, at the foot of which sat Averil Ward in\r\nher deep mourning, her back to the window, so that only her young\r\nfigure and the braids of her fair hair were to be seen; and beyond,\r\nsomething prostrate, covered with wrappers.  The sweet notes ended, Dr.\r\nMay drew a deep sigh, wiped his spectacles, and went on; Ethel hung\r\nback, not to startle the invalid by the sight of a stranger; but as\r\nAveril rose, she saw him raising himself, with a brightening smile on\r\nhis pale face, to hold out his hand to the Doctor.  In another minute\r\nAveril had come to her, shaken hands, and seated herself where she\r\ncould best command a view of her brother.\r\n\r\n\'I am glad to see him out of doors,\' said Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'Henry was bent on it; but I think the air and the glare of everything\r\nis too much for him; he is so tired and oppressed.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am sure he must like your singing,\' said Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'It is almost the only thing that answers,\' said Averil, her eyes\r\nwistfully turning to the sofa; \'he can\'t read, and doesn\'t like being\r\nread to.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is very difficult to manage a boy\'s recovery,\' said Ethel.  \'They\r\ndon\'t know how to be ill.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is not that,\' replied the sister, as if she fancied censure\r\nimplied, \'but his spirits.  Every new room he goes into seems to beat\r\nhim down; and he lies and broods.  If he could only talk!\'\r\n\r\n\'I know that so well!\' said Ethel.  But to Averil the May troubles were\r\nof old date, involved in the mists of childhood.  And Ethel seeing that\r\nher words were not taken as sympathy, continued, \'Do not the little\r\ngirls amuse him?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh no! they are too much for him; and I am obliged to keep them in the\r\nnursery.  Poor little things!  I don\'t know what we should do if your\r\nsister Mary were not so kind.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mary is very glad,\' began Ethel, confusedly.  Then rushing into her\r\nsubject: \'Next week, I am to take Aubrey to the seaside; and we thought\r\nif Leonard would join us, the change might be good for him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you,\' Averil answered, playing with her heavy jet watch-guard.\r\n\'You are very good; but I am sure he could not move so soon.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ave,\' called Leonard at that moment; and Ethel, perceiving that she\r\nlikewise was to advance, came forth in time to hear, \'O, Ave! I am to\r\ngo to the sea next week, with Aubrey May and his sister.  Won\'t it--\'\r\n\r\nThen becoming aware of the visitor, he stopped short, threw his feet\r\noff the sofa, and stood up to receive her.\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t let you come if you do like that,\' she said, shaking his long\r\nthin hand; and he let himself down again, not, however, resuming his\r\nrecumbent posture, and giving a slight but effective frown to silence\r\nhis sister\'s entreaties that he would do so.  He sat, leaning back as\r\nthough exceedingly feeble, scarcely speaking, but his eyes eloquent\r\nwith eagerness.  And very fine eyes they were!  Ethel remembered her\r\nown weariness, some twelve or fourteen years back, of the raptures of\r\nher baby-loving sisters about those eyes; and now in the absence of the\r\nflorid colouring of health, she was the more struck by the beauty of\r\nthe deep liquid brown, of the blue tinge of the white, and of the\r\nlustrous light that resided in them, but far more by their power of\r\nexpression, sometimes so soft and melancholy, at other moments earnest,\r\npleading, and almost flashing with eagerness.  It was a good mouth too,\r\nperhaps a little inclined to sternness of mould about the jaw and chin;\r\nbut that might have been partly from the absence of all softening\r\nroundness, aging the countenance for the time, just as illness had\r\nshrunk the usually sturdy figure.\r\n\r\n\'Has Ethel told you of our plan?\' asked Dr. May of the sister.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' she hesitated, in evident confusion and distress.  \'You are all\r\nvery kind, but we must see what Henry says.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have spoken to Henry!  He answers for our patching Leonard up for\r\nnext week; and I have great faith in Dr. Neptune.\'\r\n\r\nLeonard\'s looks were as bright as Averil\'s were disturbed.\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, thank you very much! but can he possibly be well enough for\r\nthe journey?\'\r\n\r\nLeonard\'s eyes said \'I shall.\'\r\n\r\n\'A week will do great things,\' said Dr. May, \'and it is a very easy\r\njourney--only four hours\' railway, and a ten miles\' drive.\'\r\n\r\nAveril\'s face was full of consternation; and Leonard leant forward with\r\nhope dancing in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\'You know the place,\' continued Dr. May, \'Coombe Hole.  Quite fresh,\r\nand unhackneyed.  It is just where Devon and Dorset meet.  I am not\r\nsure in which county; but there\'s a fine beach, and beautiful country.\r\nThe Riverses found it out, and have been there every autumn; besides\r\nsending their poor little girl and her governess down when London gets\r\ntoo hot.  Flora has written to the woman of the lodgings she always\r\nhas, and will lend them the maid she sends with little Margaret; so\r\nthey will be in clover.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is it not a very long way!\' said Averil, thinking how long those ten\r\nyards of lawn had seemed.\r\n\r\n\'Not as things go,\' said Dr. May.  \'You want Dr. Spencer to reproach\r\nyou with being a Stoneborough fungus.  There are places in Wales nearer\r\nby the map, but without railway privilege; and as to a great gay place,\r\nthey would all be sick of it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you feel equal to it? as if you should like it, Leonard?\' asked his\r\nsister, in a trembling would-be grateful voice.\r\n\r\n\'Of all things,\' was the answer.\r\n\r\nEthel thought the poor girl had suffered constraint enough, and that it\r\nwas time to release the boy from his polite durance, so she rose to\r\ntake leave, and again Leonard pulled himself upright to shake hands.\r\n\r\n\'Indeed,\' said Ethel, when Averil had followed them into the\r\ndrawing-room, \'I am sorry for you.  It would go very hard with me to\r\nmake Aubrey over to any one! but if you do trust him with me, I must\r\ncome and hear all you wish me to do for him.\'\r\n\r\n\'I cannot think that he will be able or glad to go when it comes to the\r\npoint,\' said Averil, with a shaken tone.\r\n\r\nDr. May was nearer than she thought, and spoke peremptorily.  \'Take\r\ncare what you are about!  You are not to worry him with discussions. If\r\nhe can go, he will; if not, he will stay at home; but pros and cons are\r\nprohibited.  Do you hear, Averil!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; very well.\'\r\n\r\n\'Papa you really are very cruel to that poor girl,\' were Ethel\'s first\r\nwords outside.\r\n\r\n\'Am I?  I wouldn\'t be for worlds, Ethel.  But somehow she always puts\r\nme in a rage.  I wish I knew she was not worrying her brother at this\r\nmoment!\'\r\n\r\nNo, Averil was on the staircase, struggling, choking with the first\r\ntears she had shed.  All this fortnight of unceasing vigilance and\r\nexertion, her eyes had been dry, for want of time to realize, for want\r\nof time to weep, and now she was ashamed that hurt feeling rather than\r\ngrief had opened the fountain.  She could not believe that it was not a\r\ncruel act of kindness, to carry one so weak as Leonard away from home\r\nto the care of a stranger.  She apprehended all manner of ill\r\nconsequences; and then nursing him, and regarding his progress as her\r\nown work, had been the sedative to her grief, which would come on her\r\n\'like an armed man,\' in the dreariness of his absence.  Above all, she\r\nfelt herself ill requited by his manifest eagerness to leave her who\r\nhad nursed him so devotedly--her, his own sister--for the stiff, plain\r\nMiss May whom he hardly knew.  The blow from the favourite companion\r\nbrother, so passionately watched and tended, seemed to knock her down;\r\nand Dr. May, with medical harshness, forbidding her the one last hope\r\nof persuading him out of the wild fancy, filled up the measure.\r\n\r\nOh, those tears!  How they would swell up at each throb of the wounded\r\nheart, at each dismal foreboding of the desponding spirit. But she had\r\nno time for them!  Leonard must not be left alone, with no one to cover\r\nhim up with his wrappers.\r\n\r\nThe tears were strangled, the eyes indignantly dried.  She ran out at\r\nthe garden door.  The sofa was empty!  Had Henry come home and helped\r\nhim in?  She hurried on to the window; Leonard was alone in the\r\ndrawing-room, resting breathlessly on an ottoman within the window.\r\n\r\n\'Dear Leonard!  Why didn\'t you wait for me!\'\r\n\r\n\'I thought I\'d try what I could do.  You see I am much stronger than we\r\nthought.\'  And he smiled cheerfully, as he helped himself by the\r\nfurniture to another sofa.  \'I say, Ave, do just give me the map--the\r\none in Bradshaw will do.  I want to find this place.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think there is a Bradshaw,\' said Averil, reluctantly.\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes, there is--behind the candlestick, on the study chimney-piece.\'\r\n\r\n\'Very well--\' There were more tears to be gulped down--and perhaps they\r\nkept her from finding the book.\r\n\r\n\'Where\'s the Bradshaw?\'\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t see it.\'\r\n\r\n\'I tell you I know it was there.  The left-hand candlestick, close to\r\nthe letter-weight.  I\'ll get it myself.\'\r\n\r\nHe was heaving himself up, when Averil prevented him by hastening to a\r\nmore real search, which speedily produced the book.\r\n\r\nEagerly Leonard unfolded the map, making her steady it for his shaking\r\nhand, and tracing the black toothed lines.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s Bridport--ten miles from there.  Can you see the name, Ave?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, it is not marked.\'\r\n\r\n\'Never mind.  I see where it is; and I can see it is a capital place;\r\njust in that little jag, with famous bathing.  I wonder if they will\r\nstay long enough for me to learn to swim?\'\r\n\r\n\'You are a good way from that as yet,\' said poor Averil, her heart\r\nsinking lower and lower.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I shall be well at once when I get away from here!\'\r\n\r\n\'I hope so.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, Ave!\' he cried, now first struck with her tone, \'don\'t you know I\r\nshall?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know,\' she said, from the soreness of her heart; \'but I can\'t\r\ntell how to trust you with strangers.\'\r\n\r\n\'Strangers!  You ungrateful child!\' exclaimed Leonard, indignantly.\r\n\'Why, what have they been doing for you all this time?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am sure Miss May, at least, never came near us till to-day.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m very glad of it!  I\'m sick of everything and everybody I have\r\nseen!\'\r\n\r\nEverybody!  That was the climax!  Averil just held her tongue; but she\r\nrushed to her own room, and wept bitterly and angrily.  Sick of her\r\nafter all her devotion!  Leonard, the being she loved best in the world!\r\n\r\nAnd Leonard, distressed and hurt at the reception of his natural\r\nexpression of the weariness of seven weeks\' sickness and sorrow, felt\r\nabove all the want of his mother\'s ever-ready sympathy and soothing,\r\nand as if the whole world, here, there, and everywhere, would be an\r\nequally dreary waste.  His moment of bright anticipation passed into\r\nheavy despondency, and turning his head from the light, he dropped\r\nasleep with a tear on his cheek.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke it was at the sound of movements in the room, slow and\r\ncautious, out of regard to his slumbers--and voices, likewise low--at\r\nleast one was low, the other that whisper of the inaudibility of which\r\nAveril could not be disabused.  He lay looking for a few moments\r\nthrough his eyelashes, before exerting himself to move. Averil, her\r\nface still showing signs of recent tears, sat in a low chair, a book in\r\nher lap, talking to her brother Henry.\r\n\r\nHenry was of less robust frame than Leonard promised to be, and though\r\non a smaller scale, was more symmetrically made, and had more regular\r\nfeatures than either his brother or sister, but his eyes were merely\r\nquick lively black beads, without anything of the clear depths\r\npossessed by the others.  His hair too was jet black, whereas theirs\r\nwas a pale nut brown; and his whiskers, long and curling, so nearly met\r\nunder his chin, as to betray a strong desire that the hirsute movement\r\nshould extend to the medical profession.  Always point-device in\r\napparel, the dust on his boot did not prevent its perfect make from\r\nbeing apparent; and the entire sit of his black suit would have enabled\r\na cursory glance to decide that it never came out of the same shop as\r\nDr. May\'s.\r\n\r\n\'O, Henry!\' were the words that he first heard distinctly.\r\n\r\n\'It will be much better for every one--himself and you included.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, if--\'\r\n\r\n\'If--nonsense.  I tell you he will be quite well enough.  See how well\r\nI am now, how fast I got on as soon as I took to tonics.--Ha, Leonard,\r\nold fellow! what, awake?  What do you say to this plan of old May\'s?\'\r\n\r\n\'It is very kind of him; and I should be very glad if I am well enough;\r\nbut next week is very soon,\' said Leonard, waking in the depression in\r\nwhich he had gone to sleep.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, next week!  That is as good as next year in a matter like this, as\r\nMay agreed with me, here, let us have your pulse.  You have let him get\r\nlow, Averil.  A basin of good soup will put more heart into you, and\r\nyou will feel ready for anything.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have got on to-day, said Leonard, briskly raising himself, as though\r\nthe cheerful voice had been cordial in itself.\r\n\r\n\'Of course you have, now that you have something to look forward to;\r\nand you will be in excellent hands; the very thing I wanted for you,\r\nthough I could not see how to manage it.  I am going to dress.  I shall\r\ntell them to send in dinner; and if I am not down, I shall be in the\r\nnursery.  You won\'t come in to dinner, Leonard?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, said Leonard, with a shudder.\r\n\r\n\'I shall send you in some gravy soup, that you may thank me for.  Ave\r\nnever would order anything but boiled chickens for you, and forgets\r\nthat other people ever want to eat.  There will be a chance of making a\r\nhousekeeper of her now.\'\r\n\r\nHow selfish, thought Averil, to want to get rid of poor Leonard, that I\r\nmay attend to his dinners.  Yet Henry had spoken in perfect good-humour.\r\n\r\nHenry came down with a little sister in each hand. They were his\r\nespecial darlings; and with a touch of fatherly fondness, he tried to\r\ncompensate to them for their sequestration from the drawing-room, the\r\nconsequence of Averil not having established her authority enough to\r\nkeep their spirits from growing too riotous for Leonard\'s weakness.\r\nIndeed, their chatter was Henry\'s sole enlivenment, for Averil was\r\nconstantly making excursions to ask what her patient would eat, and\r\nwatch its success; and but for his pleasure in the little girls popping\r\nabout him, he would have had a meal as dull as it was unsettled.  As\r\nsoon as the strawberries were eaten, he walked out through the window\r\nwith them clinging to him, and Averil returned to her post.\r\n\r\n\'Some music, Ave,\' said Leonard, with an instinctive dread of her\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nShe knew her voice was past singing, and began one of her most renowned\r\ninstrumental pieces, which she could play as mechanically as a\r\nmusical-box.\r\n\r\n\'Not that jingling airified thing!\' cried Leonard, \'I want something\r\nquiet and refreshing.  There\'s an evening hymn that the Mays have.\'\r\n\r\n\'The Mays know nothing of music,\' said Averil.\r\n\r\n\'Stay, this is it:\' and he whistled a few bars.\r\n\r\n\'That old thing!  Of course I know that.  We had it every Sunday at\r\nBrighton.\'\r\n\r\nShe began it, but her eyes were full of tears, partly because she hated\r\nherself for the irritation she had betrayed.  She was a sound, good,\r\nhonest-hearted girl; but among all the good things she had learned at\r\nBrighton, had not been numbered the art of ruling her own spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n  Griefs hidden in the mind like treasures,\r\n  Will turn with time to solemn pleasures.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Monday morning, the two convalescents shook hands in the\r\nwaiting-room at the station, surveying each other rather curiously;\r\nwhile Ethel, trying to conquer her trepidation, gave manifold promises\r\nto Averil of care and correspondence.\r\n\r\nDr. Spencer acted escort, being far more serviceable on the railway\r\nthan his untravelled friend, whose lame arm, heedless head, and\r\naptitude for missing trains and mistaking luggage, made him a charge\r\nrather than an assistant.  He was always happiest among his patients at\r\nhome; and the world was still ill enough to employ him so fully, that\r\nEthel hoped to be less missed than usual.  Indeed, she believed that\r\nher absence would be good in teaching him Mary\'s full-grown worth, and\r\nMary would be in the full glory of notability in the purification of\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nThe change was likewise for Dr. Spencer\'s good.  He had almost broken\r\ndown in the height of the labour, and still looked older and thinner\r\nfor it; and after one night at Coombe, he was going to refresh himself\r\nby one of his discursive tours.\r\n\r\nHe was in high spirits, and the pink of courtesy; extremely flattered\r\nby the charge of Ethel, and making her the ostensible object of his\r\nattention, to the relief of the boys, who were glad to be spared the\r\nsense of prominent invalidism.  The change was delightful to them.\r\nAubrey was full of life and talk, and sat gazing from the window, as if\r\nthe line from Stoneborough to Whitford presented a succession of\r\nnovelties.\r\n\r\n\'What\'s that old place on the river there, with crow-stepped gables and\r\nsteep roofs, like a Flemish picture?\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t you know?\' said Leonard, \'it is the Vintry mill, where my\r\nrelative lives, that wants to make a dusty miller of me.\'\r\n\r\n\'No fear of that, old fellow,\' said Aubrey, regarding him in some\r\ndismay, \'you\'ve got better things to grind at.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ay, even if I don\'t get the Randall next time, I shall be sure of it\r\nanother.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll have it next.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know; here is a quarter clean gone, and the other fellows will\r\nhave got before me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, but most of them have had a spell of fever!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, but they have not had it so thoroughly,\' said Leonard.  \'My\r\nmemory is not properly come back yet; and your father says I must not\r\ntry it too soon.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s always his way,\' said Aubrey.  \'He would not let Ethel so much\r\nas pack up my little Homer.\'\r\n\r\nLeonard\'s quick, furtive glance at Ethel was as if he suspected her of\r\nhaving been barely prevented from torturing him.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, it was not her doing,\' said Aubrey, \'it was I!  I thought Tom\r\nwould find me gone back; and, you know, we must keep up together,\r\nLeonard, and be entered at St. John\'s at the same time.\'\r\n\r\nFor Aubrey devoutly believed in Tom\'s college at Cambridge, which had\r\nrecovered all Dr. May\'s allegiance.\r\n\r\nThe extra brightness was not of long duration.  It was a very hot day,\r\nsuch as exactly suited the salamander nature of Dr. Spencer; but the\r\ncarriage became like an oven.  Aubrey curled himself up in a corner and\r\nwent to sleep, but Leonard\'s look of oppressed resignation grieved\r\nEthel, and the blue blinds made him look so livid, that she was always\r\nfancying him fainting, and then his shyness was dreadful--it was\r\nimpossible to elicit from him anything but \'No, thank you.\'\r\n\r\nHe did nearly faint when they left the train; and while Aubrey was\r\neagerly devouring the produce of the refreshment room, had to lie on a\r\nbench under Dr. Spencer\'s charge, for Ethel\'s approach only brought on\r\na dangerous spasm of politeness.  How she should get on with him for a\r\nmonth, passed her imagination.\r\n\r\nThere was a fresher breeze when they drove out of the station, up a\r\nDorset ridge of hill, steep, high, terraced and bleak; but it was slow\r\nclimbing up, and every one was baked and wearied before the summit was\r\ngained, and the descent commenced.  Even then, Ethel, sitting\r\nbackwards, could only see height develop above height, all green, and\r\nscattered with sheep, or here and there an unfenced turnip-field, the\r\nroad stretching behind like a long white ribbon, and now and then\r\ndescending between steep chalk cuttings in slopes, down which the\r\ncarriage slowly scrooped on its drag, leaving a broad blue-flecked\r\ntrail.  Dr. Spencer was asleep, hat off, and the wind lifting his snowy\r\nlocks, and she wished the others were; but Aubrey lamented on the heat\r\nand the length, and Leonard leant back in his corner, past lamentation.\r\n\r\nDown, down!  The cuttings were becoming precipitous cliffs, the drag\r\nmade dismal groans; Aubrey, after a great slip forward, looking\r\ninjured, anchored himself, with his feet against the seat, by Ethel;\r\nand Dr. Spencer was effectually wakened by an involuntary forward\r\nplunge of his opposite neighbour.  \'Can this be safe?\' quoth Ethel;\r\n\'should not some of us get out?\'\r\n\r\n\'Much you know of hills, you level landers!\' was the answer; and just\r\nthen they were met and passed by four horses dragging up a stage coach,\r\nafter the fashion of a fly on a window-pane--a stage coach! delightful\r\nto the old-world eyes of Dr. Spencer, recalling a faint memory to\r\nEthel, and presenting a perfect novelty to Aubrey.\r\n\r\nThen came a sudden turn upon flat ground, and a short cry of wonder\r\nbroke from Aubrey.  Ethel was sensible of a strange salt weedy smell,\r\nnew to her nostrils, but only saw the white-plastered, gray-roofed\r\nhouses through which they were driving; but, with another turn, the\r\nbuildings were only on one side--on the other there was a wondrous\r\nsense of openness, vastness, freshness--something level, gray, but\r\ndazzling; and before she could look again, the horses stopped, and\r\nclose to her, under the beetling, weather-stained white cliff, was a\r\nlow fence, and within it a verandah and a door, where stood Flora\'s\r\nmaid, Barbara, in all her respectability.\r\n\r\nMuch wit had been expended by Aubrey on being left to the tender mercy\r\nof cruel Barbara Allen, in whom Ethel herself anticipated a tyrant; but\r\nat the moment she was invaluable.  Every room was ready and inviting,\r\nand nothing but the low staircase between Leonard and the white bed,\r\nwhich was the only place fit for him; while for the rest, the table was\r\nspeedily covered with tea and chickens; Abbotstoke eggs, inscribed with\r\nyesterday\'s date; and red mail-clad prawns, to prove to touch and taste\r\nthat this was truly sea-side. The other senses knew it well: the open\r\nwindow let in the indescribable salt, fresh odour, and the entire view\r\nfrom it was shore and sea, there seemed nothing to hinder the tide from\r\ncoming up the ridge of shingle, and rushing straight into the cottage;\r\nand the ear was constantly struck by the regular roll and dash of the\r\nwaves. Aubrey, though with the appetite of recovery and sea-air\r\ncombined, could not help pausing to listen, and, when his meal was\r\nover, leant back in his chair, listened again, and gave a sigh of\r\ncontent.  \'It is one constant hush, hushaby,\' he said; \'it would make\r\none sleep pleasantly.\'\r\n\r\nHis companions combined their advice to him so to use it; and in less\r\nthan half an hour Ethel went to bid him good night, in the whitest of\r\nbeds and cleanest of tiny chambers, where he looked the picture of\r\nsleepy satisfaction, when she opened his window, and admitted the swell\r\nand dash that fascinated his weary senses.\r\n\r\n\'My child is all right,\' said Ethel, returning to Dr. Spencer; \'can you\r\nsay the same of yours?\'\r\n\r\n\'He must rest himself into the power of sleeping.  I must say it was a\r\nbold experiment; but it will do very well, when he has got over the\r\njourney.  He was doing no good at home.\'\r\n\r\n\'I hope he will here.\'\r\n\r\n\'Depend on it he will.  And now what are you intending?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am thirsting to see those waves near.  Would it be against the\r\nmanners and customs of sea-places for me to run down to them so late?\'\r\n\r\n\'Sea-places have no manners and customs.\'\r\n\r\nEthel tossed on her hat with a feeling of delight and freedom.  \'Oh,\r\nare you coming, Dr. Spencer?   I did not mean to drag you out.  You had\r\nrather rest, and smoke.\'\r\n\r\n\'This is rest,\' he answered.\r\n\r\nThe next moment, the ridge of the shingle was passed, and Ethel\'s feet\r\nwere sinking in the depth of pebbles, her cheeks freshened by the\r\nbreeze, her lips salted by the spray tossed in by the wind from the\r\nwave crests.  At the edge of the water she stood--as all others stand\r\nthere--watching the heaving from far away come nearer, nearer, curl\r\nover in its pride of green glassy beauty, fall into foam, and draw\r\nback, making the pebbles crash their accompanying \'frsch.\'  The\r\nrepetition, the peaceful majesty, the blue expanse, the straight\r\nhorizon, so impressed her spirit as to rivet her eyes and chain her\r\nlips; and she receded step by step before the tide, unheeding anything\r\nelse, not even perceiving her companion\'s eyes fixed on her, half\r\ncuriously, half sadly.\r\n\r\n\'Well, Ethel,\' at last he said.\r\n\r\n\'I never guessed it!\' she said, with a gasp.  \'No wonder Harry cannot\r\nbear to be away from it.  Must we leave it?\' as he moved back.\r\n\r\n\'Only to smooth ground,\' said Dr. Spencer; \'it is too dark to stay here\r\namong the stones and crab-pots.\'\r\n\r\nThe summer twilight was closing in; lights shining in the village under\r\nthe cliffs, and looking mysterious on distant points of the coast;\r\nstars were shining forth in the pale blue sky, and the young moon\r\nshedding a silver rippled beam on the water.\r\n\r\n\'If papa were but here!\' said Ethel, wakening from another gaze, and\r\nrecollecting that she was not making herself agreeable.\r\n\r\n\'So you like the expedition?\'\r\n\r\n\'The fit answer to that would be, "It is very pretty," as the Cockney\r\nsaid to Coleridge at Lodore.\'\r\n\r\n\'So I have converted a Stoneborough fungus!\'\r\n\r\n\'What! to say the sea is glorious?  A grand conversion!\'\r\n\r\n\'To find anything superior to Minster Street.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, you are but half reclaimed!  You are a living instance that there\r\nis no content unless one has begun life as a fungus.\'\r\n\r\nShe was startled by his change of tone.  \'True, Ethel.  Content might\r\nhave been won, if there had been resolution to begin without it.\'\r\n\r\n\'I beg your pardon,\' she faltered, \'I ought not to have said it.  I\r\nforgot there was such a cause.\'\r\n\r\n\'Cause--you know nothing about it.\'\r\n\r\nShe was silent, distressed, dismayed, fearing that she had spoken\r\nwrongly, and had either mistaken or been misunderstood.\r\n\r\n\'Tell me, Ethel,\' he presently said, \'what can you know of what made me\r\na wanderer?\'\r\n\r\n\'Only what papa told me.\'\r\n\r\n\'He--he was the last person to know.\'\r\n\r\n\'He told me,\' said Ethel, hurrying it out in a fright, \'that you went\r\naway--out of generosity--not to interfere with his happiness.\'\r\n\r\nThen she felt as if she had done a shocking thing, and waited\r\nanxiously, while Dr. Spencer deliberately made a deep hole in the\r\nshingle with his stick.  \'Well,\' at last he said, \'I thought that\r\nmatter was unknown to all men--above all to Dick!\'\r\n\r\n\'It was only after you were gone, that he put things together and made\r\nit out.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did--she--know?\' said Dr. Spencer, with a long breath.\r\n\r\n\'I cannot tell,\' said Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'And how or why did he tell you?\' (rather hurt.)\r\n\r\n\'It was when first you came.  I am sure no one else knows it.  But he\r\ntold me because he could not help it; he was so sorry for you.\'\r\n\r\nThey walked the whole length of the parade, and had turned before Dr.\r\nSpencer spoke again; and then he said, \'It is strange!  My one vision\r\nwas of walking on the sea-shore with her; and that just doing so with\r\nyou should have brought up the whole as fresh as five-and-thirty years\r\nago!\'\r\n\r\n\'I wish I was more like her,\' said Ethel.\r\n\r\nNo more was wanting to make him launch into the descriptions, dear to a\r\ndaughter\'s heart, of her mother in her sweet serious bloom of young\r\nwomanhood, giving new embellishments to the character already so\r\nclosely enshrined in his hearer\'s heart, the more valuable that the\r\nstream of treasured recollection flowed on in partial oblivion of the\r\nperson to whom it was addressed, or, at least, that she was the child\r\nof his rival; for, from the portrait of the quiet bright maiden, he\r\npassed to the sufferings that his own reserved nature had undergone\r\nfrom his friend\'s outspoken enthusiasm.  The professor\'s visible\r\npreference for the youth of secure prospects, had not so much\r\ndiscouraged as stung him; and in a moment of irritation at the\r\nprofessor\'s treatment, and the exulting hopes of his unconscious\r\nfriend, he had sworn to himself, that the first involuntary token of\r\nregard from the young lady towards one or the other, should decide him\r\nwhether to win name and position for her sake, or to carry his slighted\r\npassion to the utmost parts of the earth, and never again see her face.\r\n\r\n\'Ethel,\' he said, stopping short, \'never threaten Providence--above\r\nall, never keep the threat.\'\r\n\r\nEthel scarcely durst speak, in her anxiety to know what cast the die,\r\nthough with all Dr. Spencer\'s charms, she could not but pity the\r\ndelusion that could have made him hope to be preferred to her\r\nfather--above all, by her mother.  Nor could she clearly understand\r\nfrom him what had dispelled his hopes.  Something it was that took\r\nplace at the picnic on Arthur\'s Seat, of which she had previously heard\r\nas a period of untold bliss.  That something, still left in vague\r\nmystery, had sealed the fate of the two friends.\r\n\r\n\'And so,\' said Dr. Spencer, \'I took the first foreign appointment that\r\noffered.  And my poor father, who had spent his utmost on me, and had\r\nbeen disappointed in all his sons, was most of all disappointed in me.\r\nI held myself bound to abide by my rash vow; loathed tame English life\r\nwithout her, and I left him to neglect in his age.\'\r\n\r\n\'You could not have known or expected!\' exclaimed Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'What right had I to expect anything else?  It was only myself that I\r\nthought of.  I pacified him by talk of travelling, and extending my\r\nexperience, and silenced my conscience by intending to return when\r\nordinary life should have become tolerable to me--a time that never has\r\ncome.  At last, in the height of that pestilential season in India,\r\ncame a letter, warning me that my brother\'s widow had got the mastery\r\nover my poor father, and was cruelly abusing it, so that only my return\r\ncould deliver him.  It was when hundreds were perishing, and I the only\r\nmedical man near; when to have left my post would have been both\r\ndisgraceful and murderous.  Then I was laid low myself; and while I was\r\nconquering the effects of cholera, came tidings that made it nothing to\r\nme whether they or I conquered.  This,\' and he touched one of his white\r\ncurling locks, \'was not done by mere bodily exertion or ailment.\'\r\n\r\n\'You would have been too late any way,\' said Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'No, not if I had gone immediately.  I might have got him out of that\r\nwoman\'s hands, and made his life happy for years.  There was the sting,\r\nbut the crime had been long before.  You know the rest.  I had no\r\nhealth to remain, no heart to come home; and then came vagrancy indeed.\r\nI drifted wherever restlessness or impulse took me, till all my working\r\nyears were over, and till the day when the sight of your father\'s\r\nwedding-ring showed me that I should not break my mad word by accepting\r\nthe only welcome that any creature gave me.\'\r\n\r\n\'And, oh! surely you have been comforted by him?\'\r\n\r\n\'Comforted!  Cut to the heart would be truer.  One moment, I could only\r\nlook at him as having borne off my treasure to destroy it; but then\r\nthere rose on me his loving, patient, heartbroken humility and\r\ncheerfulness; and I saw such a character, such a course, as showed me\r\nhow much better he had deserved her, and filled me with shame at having\r\never less esteemed him.  And through all, there was the same dear Dick\r\nMay, that never, since the day we first met at the pump in the school\r\ncourt, had I been able to help loving with all my heart--the only being\r\nthat was glad to see me again.  When he begged me to stay and watch\r\nover your sister, what could I do but remain while she lived?\'\r\n\r\n\'So he bound you down!  Oh, you know how we thank you! no, you can\'t,\r\nnor what you have been to him, and to all of us, through the worst of\r\nour sad days.  And though it was a sacrifice, I do not think it was bad\r\nfor you.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, Ethel.  When you implored me to give up my Crimean notion, to\r\nspare your father pain, I did feel for once that you at least thought\r\nme of value to some one.\'\r\n\r\n\'I cannot bear you to speak so,\' cried Ethel.  \'You to talk of having\r\nbeen of no use!\'\r\n\r\n\'No honest man of principle and education can be utterly useless; but\r\nwhen, three days ago, I recollected that it was my sixtieth birthday, I\r\nlooked back, and saw nothing but desultory broken efforts, and restless\r\nchanges.  Your father told me, when I thought him unaware of the\r\nmeaning of his words, that if I had missed many joys, I had missed many\r\nsorrows; but I had taken the way to make my one sorrow a greater burden\r\nthan his many.\'\r\n\r\n\'But you do not grieve for my mother still?\' said Ethel, anxiously.\r\n\'Even his grief is a grave joy to him now; and one is always told that\r\nsuch things, as it was with you, are but a very small part of a man\'s\r\nlife.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am not one of the five hundred men, whom any one of five hundred\r\nwomen might have equally pleased,\' said Dr. Spencer; \'but it is so far\r\ntrue, that the positive pain and envy wore out, and would not have\r\ninterfered with my after life, but for my own folly.  No, Ethel; it was\r\nnot the loss of her that embittered and threw away my existence; it was\r\nmy own rash vow, and its headstrong fulfilment, which has left me no\r\nright to your father\'s peaceful spirit.\'\r\n\r\n\'How little we guessed!\' said Ethel.  \'So cheerful and ready as you\r\nalways are.\'\r\n\r\n\'I never trouble others, he said abruptly.  \'Neither man nor woman ever\r\nheard a word of all this; and you would not have heard it now, but for\r\nthat sea; and you have got your mother\'s voice, and some of her ways,\r\nsince you have grown older and more sedate.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I am so glad!\' said Ethel, who had been led to view her likeness\r\nto her father as natural, that to her mother as acquired.\r\n\r\nThose were the last words of the conversation; but Ethel, leaning from\r\nher window to listen to the plash of the waves, suspected that the\r\nslowly moving meteor she beheld, denoted that a cigar was soothing the\r\nemotions excited by their dialogue.  She mused long over that\r\nrevelation of the motives of the life that had always been noble and\r\ngenerous in the midst of much that was eccentric and wayward, and\r\nconstantly the beat of the waves repeated to her the half-comprehended\r\nwords, \'Never threaten Providence.\'\r\n\r\nAfter superintending Aubrey\'s first bath, and duly installing the\r\nvice-M. D. and her charges, Dr. Spencer departed; and Ethel was\r\nlaunched on an unknown ocean, as pilot to an untried crew.  She had\r\nbeen told to regard Leonard\'s bashfulness as a rare grace; but it was\r\nvery inconvenient to have the boy wretchedly drooping, and owning\r\nnothing amiss, apparently unacquainted with any English words, except\r\n\'Thank you\' and \'No, thank you.\'  Indeed, she doubted whether the\r\nshyness were genuine, for stories were afloat of behaviour at\r\nStoneborough parties which savoured of audacity, and she vainly\r\nconsulted Aubrey whether the cause of his discomfiture were her age or\r\nher youth, her tutorship or her plain face.  Even Aubrey could not\r\nelicit any like or dislike, wish or complaint; and shrugging up his\r\nshoulders, decided that it was of no use to bother about it; Leonard\r\nwould come to his senses in time.  He was passive when taken out\r\nwalking, submissive when planted on a three-cornered camp-stool that\r\nexpanded from a gouty walking-stick, but seemed so inadequately\r\nperched, and made so forlorn a spectacle, that they were forced to put\r\nhim indoors out of the glare of sea and sky, and hoping that he would\r\ncondescend to the sofa when Ethel was out of sight.\r\n\r\nPunctilio broke down the next morning; and in the midst of breakfast,\r\nhe was forced to lie down, and allow Ethel to bathe his face with\r\nvinegar and water; while she repented of the \'make-the-best-of-it\'\r\nletter of the yesterday, and sent Aubrey out on a secret commission of\r\ninquiry about medical men, in case of need.  Aubrey was perfectly well,\r\nand in such a state of desultory enjoyment and sea-side active\r\nidleness, that he was quite off her mind, only enlivening her morning\r\nof nursing by his exits and entrances, to tell of fresh discoveries, or\r\nincidents wonderful to the inland mind.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, which had driven Leonard to lie on his bed, Aubrey\r\npersuaded his sister to come to see his greatest prize; a quaint old\r\nlocal naturalist, a seafaring man, with a cottage crammed with pans of\r\nlive wonders of the deep in water, and shelves of extinct ones, \'done\r\nup in stane pies,\' not a creature, by sea or land, that had haunted\r\nCoombe for a few million of ages, seemed to have escaped him. Such\r\nsea-side sojourns as the present, are the prime moments for coquetries\r\nwith the lighter branches of natural science, and the brother and\r\nsister had agreed to avail themselves of the geological facilities of\r\ntheir position, the fascinations of Hugh Miller\'s autobiography having\r\nentirely gained them during Aubrey\'s convalescence.  Ethel tore herself\r\naway from the discussion of localities with the old man, who was guide\r\nas well as philosopher, boatman as well as naturalist, and returned to\r\nher patient, whom she found less feverish, though sadly low and languid.\r\n\r\n\'I wish I knew what to do for you,\' she said, sitting down by him.\r\n\'What would your sister do for you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothing,\' he wearily said, \'I mean, a great deal too much.\'  The tone\r\nso recalled Norman\'s dejected hopelessness, that she could not help\r\ntenderly laying her cold hands on the hot brow, and saying, \'Yes, I\r\nknow how little one can do as a sister--and the mockery it is to think\r\nthat one place can ever be taken!\'\r\n\r\nThe brown eyes looked at her with moist earnestness that she could\r\nhardly bear, but closed with a look of relief and soothing, as she held\r\nher hand on his forehead.  Presently, however, he said, \'Don\'t let me\r\nkeep you in.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have been out, thank you.  I am so glad to try to do anything for\r\nyou.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you.  What o\'clock is it, please?  Ah, then I ought to take that\r\ndraught!  I forgot it in the morning.\'\r\n\r\nHe permitted her to fetch it and pour it out, but as she recognized a\r\npowerful tonic, she exclaimed, \'Is this what you are taking?  May it\r\nnot make you feverish?\'\r\n\r\n\'No doubt it does,\' he said, lying down again; \'it was only Henry--\'\r\n\r\n\'What! did not my father know of it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course he does not, as it seems to be poison.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not exactly that,\' said Ethel; \'but I was surprised, for it was talked\r\nof for Aubrey; but they said it wanted watching.\'\r\n\r\n\'Just like Henry,\' observed Leonard.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said Ethel, repressing her indignation, \'I am glad, at least,\r\nto find a possible cause for your bad night.  We shall see you\r\nrefreshed to-morrow, and not wishing yourself at home.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t think that I wish that.  Home is gone for ever.\'\r\n\r\n\'Home may be gone higher--up to the real Home,\' said Ethel, blushing\r\nwith the effort at the hint, and coming down to earthlier consolations,\r\n\'but even the fragments will grow into home again here, and you will\r\nfeel very differently.\'\r\n\r\nLeonard did not answer; but after a pause said, \'Miss May, is not it a\r\nhorrid pity girls should go to school?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am no judge, Leonard.\'\r\n\r\n\'You see,\' said the boy, \'after the little girls were born, my mother\r\nhad no time for Ave, and sent her to Brighton, and there she begged to\r\nstay on one half after another, learning all sorts of things; but only\r\ncoming home for short holidays, like company, for us to wonder at her\r\nand show her about, thinking herself ever so much in advance of my poor\r\nmother, and now she knows just nothing at all of her!\'\r\n\r\n\'You cannot tell, Leonard, and I am sure she has been devoted to you.\'\r\n\r\n\'If she had stayed at home like you, she might have known how to let\r\none alone.  Oh, you can\'t think what peace it was yesterday!\'\r\n\r\n\'Was it peace?  I feared it was desertion.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is much better to be by oneself, than always worried.  To have them\r\nalways at me to get up my spirits when the house is miserable--\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah,\' said Ethel, \'I remember your mother rejoicing that she had not to\r\nsend you from home, and saying you were always so kind and gentle to\r\nher.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did she!\' cried the boy, eagerly.  \'Oh, but she forgot--\' and he hid\r\nhis face, the features working with anguish.\r\n\r\n\'So pleased and proud she used to look, walking with you on Saturday\r\nafternoons.\'\r\n\r\n\'Those Saturdays!  They were the only walks she ever would take; but\r\nshe would always come with me.\'\r\n\r\nMore followed in the same strain, and Ethel began to gather more\r\ndistinct impressions of the Ward family.  She saw that her present\r\ncharge was warm and sound-hearted, and that the strength of his\r\naffections had been chiefly absorbed by the homely housewifely mother,\r\ncomparatively little esteemed by the modernized brother and sister.  Of\r\nthe loss of his father he seemed to think less; it seemed, indeed,\r\nrather to reconcile him to that of his mother, by the grief it spared\r\nher; and it confirmed Ethel\'s notion, that Mr. Ward, a busy and dull\r\nman, paid no great attention to his children between the plaything\r\nperiod and that of full development.  The mother was the home; and\r\nAveril, though Leonard showed both love for and pride in her, had\r\nhitherto been a poor substitute, while as to Henry, there was something\r\nin each mention of him which gave Ethel an undefined dread of the\r\nfuture of the young household, and a doubt of the result of her\r\nfather\'s kind schemes of patronage.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, this conversation had the happy effect of banishing\r\nconstraint, and satisfying Ethel that the let-alone system was\r\nkindness, not neglect.  She was at ease in discussing fossils, though\r\nhe contributed no word, and she let him sleep or wake as he best liked;\r\nwhilst Aubrey read to her the \'Cruise of the Betsey.\'\r\n\r\nHenry\'s prescription was sent to invigorate the fishes, when its\r\ncessation was found to be followed by the recovery of sleep and\r\nappetite, and in the cool of the evening, by a disposition to stroll on\r\nthe beach, and lie under the lee of a rock upon a railway rug, which\r\nEthel had substituted for the \'three-legged delusion.\'\r\n\r\nThere he was left, while his companions went fossil-hunting, and stayed\r\nso long as to excite their compunction, and quicken their steps when\r\nthey at length detached themselves from the enticing blue lias.\r\n\r\n\'What has he got there?\' cried Aubrey.  \'Hillo, old fellow! have you\r\nfallen a prey to a black cat?\'\r\n\r\n\'Cat!\' returned Leonard, indignantly; \'don\'t you see it is the jolliest\r\nlittle dog in the world?\'\r\n\r\n\'You call that a dog?\' said the other boy with redoubled contempt; \'it\r\nis just big enough for little Margaret\'s Noah\'s Ark!\'\r\n\r\n\'It really is a beauty!\' said Ethel.  \'I have known one of Flora\'s\r\nguests bring a bigger one in her muff.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is the most sensible little brute,\' added Leonard.  \'See; beg, my\r\nman, beg!\'\r\n\r\nAnd the beauteous little black-coated King Charles erected itself on\r\nits hind legs, displaying its rich ruddy tan waistcoat and sleeves, and\r\nbeseeching with its black diamond eyes for the biscuit, dropped and\r\ncaught in mid-air.  It was the first time Leonard had looked bright.\r\n\r\n\'So you expect us to sanction your private dog stealing?\' said Aubrey.\r\n\r\n\'I have been watching for his mistress to come back,\' said Leonard;\r\n\'but she must have passed an hour ago, and she does not deserve to have\r\nhim, for she never looked back for him; and he had run up to me,\r\nfrisking and making much of me, as if he had found an old friend.\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps it will run home when we move.\'\r\n\r\nNo such thing; it trotted close at Leonard\'s heels, and entered the\r\nhouse with them.  Barbara was consulted, and on Leonard\'s deposition\r\nthat the dog\'s mistress was in deep mourning, opined that she could be\r\nno other than the widow of an officer, who during his lingering illness\r\nhad been often laid upon the beach, and had there played with his\r\nlittle dogs.  This one, evidently very young, had probably, in the\r\nconfusion of its puppy memory, taken the invalid for its lost master.\r\n\r\n\'Stupid little thing,\' said Aubrey; \'just like an undersized lady\'s\r\ntoy.\'\r\n\r\n\'It knows its friends.  These little things have twice the sense of\r\novergrown dogs as big and as stupid as jackasses.\'\r\n\r\nA retort from Leonard was welcome in Ethel\'s ears, and she quite\r\ndeveloped his conversational powers, in an argument on the sagacity of\r\nall canine varieties.  It was too late to send the little animal home;\r\nand he fondled and played with it till bed-time, when he lodged it in\r\nhis own room; and the attachment was so strong, that it was with a deep\r\nsigh, that at breakfast he accepted Aubrey\'s offer of conveying it home.\r\n\r\n\'There she is! he exclaimed in the midst, gazing from the window.\r\n\r\n\'And see the perfection of the animal!\' added Aubrey, pointing to a\r\nbroad-backed waddling caricature of the little black fairy.\r\n\r\n\'Restitution must be made, little as she deserves you, you little\r\njewel,\' said Leonard, picking up the object of his admiration.  \'I\'ll\r\ntake you out.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no; I am not so infectious,\' said Ethel, tying on her hat; \'I had\r\nbetter do it.\'\r\n\r\nAnd after Leonard\'s parting embrace to his favourite, she received it;\r\nand quickly overtaking the pensive steps of the lady, arrested her\r\nprogress with, \'I beg your pardon, but I think this is your dog.\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor little Mab! as the dog struggled to get to her, and danced gladly\r\nround her.  \'I missed her last night, and was coming to look for her.\'\r\n\r\n\'She joined one of our party,\' said Ethel; \'and he was not strong\r\nenough to follow you.  Indeed, he has had scarlet fever, so perhaps it\r\nwas better not.  But he has taken great care of the little dog, and\r\nhopes it is not the worse.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you.  I wish poor Mab may always meet such kind friends,\' said\r\nthe lady, sadly.\r\n\r\n\'She secured her welcome,\' said Ethel.  \'We were very grateful to her,\r\nfor it was the first thing that has seemed to interest him since his\r\nillness; and he has just lost both his parents.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah!  Thank you.\'\r\n\r\nEthel wondered at herself for having been so communicative; but the\r\nsweet sad face and look of interest had drawn her words out; and on her\r\nreturn she made such a touching history of the adventure, that Leonard\r\nlistened earnestly, and Aubrey looked subdued.\r\n\r\nWhen they went out Leonard refused to spread his rug in that only bed\r\nof pulverized shingle; and Ethel respected his avoidance of it as\r\ndelicacy to her whose husband had no doubt often occupied that spot.\r\n\r\n\'He is a thorough gentleman,\' said she, as she walked away with Aubrey.\r\n\r\n\'He might be an Eton fellow,\' was the significant reply.\r\n\r\n\'I wonder what made him so!\' said Ethel, musingly.\r\n\r\n\'Looking at Tom,\' returned Aubrey, not in jest.\r\n\r\n\'Even with that advantage, I don\'t quite see where he learnt that\r\nrefined consideration.\'\r\n\r\n\'Pshaw, Ethel!  The light of nature would show that to any one but a\r\nstupex.\'\r\n\r\nEthel was not sorry that such were Aubrey\'s views of courtesy, but all\r\nthought of that subject was soon lost in the pursuit of ammonites.\r\n\r\n\'I wonder what Leonard will have picked up now?\' they speculated, as\r\nthey turned homewards with their weighty baskets, but what was their\r\namazement, when Leonard waved his hand, pointing to the little black\r\ndog again at his feet!\r\n\r\n\'She is mine!\' he exclaimed, \'my own!  Mrs. Gisborne has given her to\r\nme; and she is to be the happiest little mite going!\'\r\n\r\n\'Given!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  She came as soon as you were gone, and sat by me, and talked for\r\nan hour, but she goes to-morrow to live with an old hag of an aunt.\'\r\n\r\n\'Really, you seem to have been on confidential terms.\'\r\n\r\n\'I mean that she must be a nuisance, because she doesn\'t like dogs; so\r\nthat Mrs. Gisborne can only take the old one, which she could never\r\npart with.  So she wanted to give Mab to some one who would be kind to\r\nher; and she has come to the right shop; hasn\'t she, my little queen?\'\r\n\r\n\'I thought she almost wished it this morning,\' said Ethel, \'when she\r\nheard how you and Mab had taken to each other: but it is a very choice\r\npresent; the creature looks to me to be of a very fine sort.\'\r\n\r\n\'Now, Miss May, how could you know that?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, by her own deportment!  Don\'t you know the aristocratic look that\r\nall high-bred animals have--even bantams?\'\r\n\r\nLeonard looked as if this were the most convincing proof of Ethel\'s\r\nwisdom, and proceeded.  \'Well, she is descended from a real King\r\nCharles, that Charles II. brought from France, and gave to Mrs. Jane\r\nLane; and they have kept up the breed ever since.\'\r\n\r\n\'So that Mab will have the longest pedigree in Stoneborough; and we\r\nmust all respect her!\' said Ethel, stroking the black head.\r\n\r\n\'I am only surprised at Leonard\'s forgetting his place,\' said Aubrey.\r\n\'Walking before her majesty, indeed!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, attendants do come first sometimes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then it should be backwards!  I have a mind to try lying on the beach\r\nto-morrow, looking interesting, to see what will descend upon me!\'\r\n\r\n\'A great yellow mongrel,\' said Ethel, \'as always befalls imitators in\r\nthe path of the hero.\'\r\n\r\n\'What?  You mean that it was all the work of Leonard\'s beaux yeux?\'\r\n\r\nLeonard gave a sort of growl, intimating that Aubrey was exciting his\r\ndispleasure; and Ethel was glad to be at home, and break off the\r\nconversation; but in a few minutes Aubrey knocked at her door, and\r\nedging himself in, mysteriously said,  \'Such fun!  So it was your beaux\r\nyeux, not Leonard\'s, that made the conquest!\'\r\n\r\n\'I suppose she was touched with what I said of poor Leonard\'s\r\ncircumstances, and the pleasure the creature gave him.\'\r\n\r\n\'That is as prosy as Mary, Ethel.  At any rate, the woman told Leonard\r\nyours was the most irresistibly attractive countenance she ever saw,\r\nshort of beauty; and that\'s not the best of it, for he is absolutely\r\nangry.\r\n\r\n\'No wonder,\' laughed Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'No, but it\'s about the beauty!  He can\'t conceive a face more\r\nbeautiful than yours.\'\r\n\r\n\'Except the gargoyle on the church tower,\' said Ethel, gaping into as\r\ncomplete a model of that worthy as flesh and blood could perpetrate.\r\n\r\n\'But he means it,\' persisted Aubrey, fixing his eyes critically on his\r\nsister\'s features, but disturbed by the contortions into which she\r\nthrew them.  \'Now don\'t, don\'t.  I never saw any fellow with a\r\nhundredth part of your gift for making faces,\' he added, between the\r\nunwilling paroxysms of mirth at each fresh grimace; but I want to judge\r\nof you; and--oh! that solemn one is worse than all; it is like Julius\r\nCaesar, if he had ever been photographed!--but really, when one comes\r\nto think about it, you are not so very ugly after all; and are much\r\nbetter looking than Flora, whom we were taught to believe in.\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor Flora!  You were no judge in her blooming days, before wear and\r\ntear came.\'\r\n\r\n\'And made her like our Scotch grandfather.\'\r\n\r\n\'But Blanche! your own Blanche, Aubrey?  She might have extended\r\nLeonard\'s ideas of beauty.\'\r\n\r\n\'Blanche has a pretty little visage of her own; but it\'s not so well\r\nworth looking at as yours,\' said Aubrey.  \'One has seen to the end of\r\nit at once; and it won\'t light up.  Hers is just the May blossom; and\r\nyours the--the--I know--the orchis!  I have read of a woman with an\r\norchidaceous face!\'\r\n\r\nTeeth, tongue, lips, eyes, and nose were at once made to serve in\r\nhitting off an indescribable likeness to an orchis blossom, which was\r\nrapturously applauded, till Ethel, relaxing the strain and permitting\r\nherself to laugh triumphantly at her own achievement, said,  \'There! I\r\ndo pride myself on being of a high order of the grotesque.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is not the grotesque that he means.\' said Aubrey, \'he is very\r\ncracked indeed.  He declares that when you came and sat by him the day\r\nbefore yesterday, you were perfectly lovely.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, then I understand, and it is no matter,\' said Ethel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n  They stwons, they stwons, they stwons, they stwons.\r\n                                --Scouring of the White Horse\r\n\r\n\r\n\'So\' (wrote Ethel in her daily letter to her father) \'mine is at\r\npresent a maternal mission to Leonard, and it is highly gratifying. I\r\nsubscribe to all your praise of him, and repent of my ungracious\r\nmurmurs at his society.  You had the virtue, and I have the reward (the\r\nusual course of this world), for his revival is a very fresh and\r\npleasant spectacle, burning hot with enthusiasm.  Whatever we do, he\r\noverdoes, till I recollect how Wilkes said he had never been a Wilkite.\r\nThree days ago, a portentous-looking ammonite attracted his attention;\r\nand whereas he started from the notion that earth was dirt, and stones\r\nwere stones, the same all over the world, he has since so far\r\noutstripped his instructors, that as I write this he is drawing a plan\r\nof the strata, with the inhabitants dramatically arranged, Aubrey\r\nsuggesting tragic scenes and uncomplimentary likenesses.  His talent\r\nfor drawing shows that Averil\'s was worth culture.  If our geology\r\nalarm Richard, tell him that I think it safer to get it over young, and\r\nto face apparent discrepancies with revelation, rather than leave them\r\nto be discovered afterwards as if they had been timidly kept out of\r\nsight.  And whether Hugh Miller\'s theory be right or wrong, his grand\r\nfervid language leaves the conviction that undoubting confidence in\r\nrevelation consists with the clearest and most scientific mind.\'\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\'June 30th.--I consider my boys as returned to their normal relations.\r\nI descended on them as they were sparring like lion-cubs at play,\r\nLeonard desisted in confusion at my beholding such savage doings, but\r\ncool and easy, not having turned a hair; Aubrey, panting, done up,\r\nrailing at him as first cousin to Hercules, all as a delicate boast to\r\nme of his friend\'s recovered strength.  Aubrey\'s forte is certainly\r\nveneration.  His first class of human beings is a large one, though\r\nquizzing is his ordinary form of adoration.  For instance, he teases\r\nMab and her devoted slave some degrees more than the victim can bear,\r\nand then relieves his feelings in my room by asseverations that the\r\nfriendship with Leonard will be on the May and Spencer pattern.  The\r\nsea is the elixir of life to both; Leonard looks quite himself again,\r\n"only more so," and Aubrey has a glow never seen since his full moon\r\nvisage waned, and not all tan, though we are on the high road to be\r\ncoffee-berries.  Aubrey daily entertains me with heroic tales of diving\r\nand floating, till I tell them they will become enamoured of some "lady\r\nof honour who lives in the sea," grow fishes\' tails, and come home no\r\nmore.  And really, as the time wanes, I feel that such a coast is\r\nElysium--above all, the boating.  The lazy charm, the fresh purity of\r\nair, the sights and sounds, the soft summer wave when one holds one\'s\r\nhand over the tide, the excitement of sea-weed catching, and the\r\nnonsense we all talk, are so delicious and such new sensations, (except\r\nthe nonsense, which loses by your absence, O learned doctor!) that I\r\nfully perceive how pleasures untried cannot even be conceived.  But ere\r\nthe lotos food has entirely depraved my memory, I give you warning to\r\ncome and fetch us home, now that the boys are in full repair.  Come\r\nyourself, and be feasted on shrimps and mackerel, and take one sail to\r\nthe mouth of the bay.  I won\'t say who shall bring you; it would be fun\r\nto have Daisy, and Mary ought to have a holiday, but then Richard would\r\ntake better care of you, and Tom would keep you in the best order.\r\nCould you not all come? only if you don\'t yourself, I won\'t promise not\r\nto take up with a merman.\'\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\'July 4th.--Very well.  If this is to make a strong man of Aubrey, tant\r\nmieux, and even home and Cocksmoor yearnings concern me little in this\r\nCastle of Indolence, so don\'t flatter yourself that I shall grumble at\r\nhaving had to take our house on again.  Let us keep Leonard; we should\r\nboth miss him extremely, and Aubrey would lose half the good without\r\nsome one to swim, scramble, and fight with. Indeed, for the poor\r\nfellow\'s own sake, he should stay, for though he is physically as\r\nstrong as a young megalosaur, and in the water or on the rocks all day,\r\nI don\'t think his head is come to application, nor his health to\r\nbearing depression; and I see he dreads the return, so that he had\r\nbetter stay away till school begins again.\'\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\'July 7th.--Oh! you weak-minded folks!  Now I know why you wanted to\r\nkeep me away--that you might yield yourselves a prey to Flora.  Paper\r\nand chintz forsooth!  All I have to say is this, Miss Mary--as to my\r\nroom, touch it if you dare!  I leave papa to protect his own study, but\r\nfor the rest, think, Mary, what your feelings would be if Harry were to\r\ncome home, and not know what room he was in!  If I am to choose between\r\nthe patterns of chintz, I prefer the sea-weed variety, as in character\r\nwith things in general, and with the present occasion; and as to the\r\ncarpet, I hope that Flora, touched with our submission, will not send\r\nus anything distressing.\'\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\'July 17th.--Can you send me any more of the New Zealand letters?  I\r\nhave copied out the whole provision I brought with me for the blank\r\nbook, and by the way have inoculated Leonard with such a missionary\r\nfever as frightens me.  To be sure, he is cut out for such work.  He is\r\nintended for a clergyman (on grounds of gentility, I fear), and is too\r\nfull of physical energy and enterprise to take readily to sober\r\nparochial life.  His ardour is a gallant thing, and his home ties not\r\nbinding; but it is not fair to take advantage of his present\r\ninflammable state of enthusiasm, and the little we have said has been\r\ntaken up so fervently, that I have resolved on caution for the future.\r\nIt is foolish to make so much of a boy\'s eagerness, especially when\r\ncircumstances have brought him into an unnatural dreamy mood; and\r\nprobably these aspirations will pass away with the sound of the waves,\r\nbut they are pretty and endearing while they last in their force and\r\nsincerity.\r\n\r\n            \'"Just at the age \'twixt boy and youth,\r\n              When thought is speech, and speech is truth;"\r\n\r\n\'and one\'s heart beats at the thought of what is possible to creatures\r\nof that age.\'\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\'July 21st.--You, who taught us to love our Walter Scott next to our\r\n"Christian Year," and who gave us half-crowns for rehearsing him when\r\nother children were learning the Robin\'s Petition, what think you of\r\nthis poor boy Leonard knowing few of the novels and none of the poems?\r\nNo wonder the taste of the day is grovelling lower and lower, when\r\npeople do not begin with the pure high air of his world!  To take up\r\none of his works after any of our present school of fiction is like\r\ngetting up a mountain side after a feverish drawing-room or an\r\noffensive street.  If it were possible to know the right moment for a\r\nbook to be really tasted--not thrust aside because crammed down--no, it\r\nwould not be desirable, as I was going to say, we should only do double\r\nmischief.  We are not sent into the world to mould people, but to let\r\nthem mould themselves; and the internal elasticity will soon unmake all\r\nthe shapes that just now seem to form under my fingers like clay.\r\n\r\n\'At any rate, the introduction of such a congenial spirit to Sir Walter\r\nwas a real treat; Leonard has the very nature to be fired by him, and\r\nAubrey being excessively scandalized at his ignorance, routed a cheap\r\n"Marmion" out of the little bookshop, and we beguiled a wet afternoon\r\nwith it; Aubrey snatching it from me at all the critical passages, for\r\nfear I should not do them justice, and thundering out the battle, which\r\nstirred the other boy like a trumpet sound.  Indeed, Leonard got Mab\r\ninto a corner, and had a very bad cold in the head when De Wilton was\r\nre-knighted; and when "the hand of Douglas was his own," he jumped up\r\nand shouted out, "Well done, old fellow!"  Then he took it to himself\r\nand read it all over again, introductions and all, and has raved ever\r\nsince.  I wish you could see Aubrey singing out some profane couplet of\r\n"midnight and not a nose," or some more horrible original parody, and\r\nthen dodging apparently in the extremity of terror, just as Leonard\r\nfuriously charges him.\r\n\r\n\'But you would have been struck with their discussions over it.  Last\r\nnight, at tea, they began upon the woeful result of the Wager of\r\nBattle, which seemed to oppress them as if it had really happened. Did\r\nI believe in it?  Was I of the Lady Abbess\'s opinion, that\r\n\r\n             \'"Perchance some form was unobserved,\r\n              Perchance in prayer or faith he swerved"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\'This from Aubrey, while Leonard rejoined that even if De Wilton had so\r\ndone, it was still injustice that he should be so cruelly ruined, and\r\nMarmion\'s baseness succeed.  It would be like a king wilfully giving\r\nwrong judgment because the right side failed in some respectful\r\nobservance.  He was sure such a thing could never be.  Did I ever know\r\nof a real case where Heaven did not show the right?  It was confusing\r\nand alarming, for both those boys sat staring at me as if I could\r\nanswer them; and those wonderful searching eyes of Leonard\'s were\r\nfixed, as if his whole acquiescence in the dealings of Providence were\r\ngoing to depend on the reply, that could but be unsatisfactory.  I\r\ncould only try plunging deep.  I said it was Job\'s difficulty, and it\r\nwas a new light to Leonard that Job was about anything but patience.\r\nHe has been reading the Book all this Sunday evening; and is not De\r\nWilton a curious introduction to it?  But Aubrey knew that I meant the\r\nbewilderment of having yet to discover that Divine Justice is\r\nlonger-sighted than human justice, and he cited the perplexities of\r\nhigh-minded heathen.  Thence we came to the Christian certainty that\r\n"to do well and suffer for it is thankworthy;" and that though no\r\nmortal man can be so innocent as to feel any infliction wholly\r\nunmerited and disproportioned, yet human injustice at its worst may be\r\nworking for the sufferer an exceeding weight of glory, or preparing him\r\nfor some high commission below. Was not Ralph de Wilton far nobler and\r\npurer as the poor palmer, than as Henry the Eighth\'s courtier!  And if\r\nyou could but have heard our sequel, arranging his orthodoxy, his\r\nScripture reading, and his guardianship of distressed monks and nuns,\r\nyou would have thought he had travelled to some purpose, only he would\r\ncertainly have been burnt by one party, and beheaded by the other.  On\r\nthe whole, I think Leonard was a little comforted, and I cannot help\r\nhoping that the first apparently cruel wrong that comes before him may\r\nbe the less terrible shock to his faith from his having been set to\r\nthink out the question by "but half a robber and but half a knight."\'\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\'August 1st.--Yesterday afternoon we three were in our private\r\ngeological treasury, Leonard making a spread-eagle of himself in an\r\nimpossible place on the cliff side, trying to disinter what hope,\r\nspringing eternal in the human breast, pronounced to be the paddle of a\r\nsaurian; Aubrey, climbing as high as he durst, directing operations and\r\nmaking discoveries; I, upon a ledge half-way up, guarding Mab and\r\npoking in the debris, when one of the bridal pairs, with whom the place\r\nis infested, was seen questing about as if disposed to invade our\r\npremises.  Aubrey, reconnoitring in high dudgeon, sarcastically\r\nobserved that all red-haired men are so much alike, that he should have\r\nsaid yonder was Hec--.  The rest ended in a view halloo from above and\r\nbelow, and three bounds to the beach, whereon I levelled my glass, and\r\nperceived that in very deed it was Mr. and Mrs. Ernescliffe who were\r\nhopping over the shingle.  Descending, I was swung off the last rock in\r\na huge embrace, and Hector\'s fiery moustache was scrubbing both my\r\ncheeks before my feet touched the ground, and Blanche with both arms\r\nround my waist.  They were ready to devour us alive in their famine for\r\na Stoneborough face; and as Flora and Mary are keeping home\r\nuninhabitable, found themselves obliged to rush away from Maplewood in\r\nthe middle of their county welcomes for a little snatch of us, and to\r\njoin us in vituperating the new furniture.  If Mary could only hear\r\nHector talk of a new sofa that he can\'t put his boots upon--he says it\r\nis bad enough at Maplewood, but that he did hope to be still\r\ncomfortable at home. They have to get back to dine out to-morrow, but\r\nmeantime the fun is more fast and furious than ever, and as soon as the\r\ntide serves, we are to fulfil our long-cherished desire of boating\r\nround to Lyme.  I won\'t answer for the quantity of discretion added to\r\nour freight, but at least there is six feet more of valour, and Mrs.\r\nBlanche for my chaperon.  Bonnie Blanche is little changed by her four\r\nmonths\' matrimony, and only looks prettier and more stylish, but she is\r\npainfully meek and younger-sisterish, asking my leave instead of her\r\nhusband\'s, and distressed at her smartness in her pretty shady hat and\r\nundyed silk, because I was in trim for lias-grubbing.  Her appearance\r\nought to be an example to all the brides in the place with skirts in\r\nthe water, and nothing on to keep off eyes, sun, or wind from their\r\nfaces.  I give Flora infinite credit for it.  Blanche and Aubrey walk\r\narm in arm in unceasing talk, and that good fellow, Hector, has\r\nincluded Leonard in the general fraternity.  They are highly\r\ncomplimentary, saying they should have taken Aubrey for Harry, he is so\r\nmuch stouter and rosier, and that Leonard is hugely grown. Here come\r\nthese three boys shouting that the boat is ready; I really think Hector\r\nis more boyish and noisy than ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n             "Five precious souls, and all agog\r\n              To dash through thick or thin."\r\n\r\n\r\nI\'ll take the best care of them in my power.  Good-bye.\'\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\'August 2nd.--Safe back, without adventure, only a great deal of\r\nenjoyment, for which I am doubly thankful, as I almost fancied we were\r\nfey, one of the many presentiments that come to nothing, but perhaps do\r\nus rather good than harm for all that.  I hope I did not show it in my\r\nletter, and communicate it to you.  Even when safe landed, I could not\r\nbut think of the Cobb and Louisa Musgrove, as I suppose every one does.\r\nWe slept at the inn; drove with the Ernescliffes to the station this\r\nmorning, and came back to this place an hour ago, after having been\r\nsteeped in pleasure.  I shall send the description of Lyme to Daisy\r\nto-morrow, having no time for it now, as I want an answer from you\r\nabout our going to Maplewood.  The "married babies" are bent upon it,\r\nand Hector tries to demonstrate that it is the shortest way home, to\r\nwhich I can\'t agree; but as it may save another journey, and it will be\r\nnice to see them in their glory, I told them that if you could spare\r\nus, we would go from the 29th to the 4th of September.  This will bring\r\nLeonard home four days before the end of the holidays, for he has been\r\nmost warmly invited, Hector adopting him into the brotherhood of papa\'s\r\npets.  I am glad he is not left out; and Mary had better prove to\r\nAveril that he will be much happier for having no time at home before\r\nthe half year begins. He still shrinks from the very name being brought\r\nbefore him.  Let me know, if you please, whether this arrangement will\r\nsuit, as I am to write to Blanche.  Dear little woman, I hope Hector\r\nwon\'t make a spoilt child of her, they are so very young, and their\r\nmeans seem so unlimited to them both, Hector wanting to make her and us\r\npresents of whatever we admired, and when she civilly praised Mab,\r\nvehemently declaring that she should have just such another if money\r\ncould purchase, or if not, he would find a way.  "Thank you, Hector\r\ndear, I had rather not," placidly responds Blanche, making his\r\nvehemence fall so flat, and Leonard\'s almost exulting alarm glide into\r\nsuch semi-mortification, that I could have laughed, though I remain in\r\nhopes that her "rather not" may always be as prudent, for I believe it\r\nis the only limit to Hector\'s gifts.\'\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\'29th, 8 A. M.--Farewell to the Coombe of Coombes.  I write while\r\nwaiting for the fly, and shall post this at Weymouth, where we are to\r\nbe met.  We have been so happy here, that I could be sentimental, if\r\nLeonard were not tete-a-tete with me, and on the verge of that\r\npredicament.  "Never so happy in his life," quoth he, "and never will\r\nbe again--wonders when he shall gee this white cliff again."  But,\r\nhappily, in tumbles Aubrey with the big claw of a crab, which he\r\ninsists on Leonard\'s wearing next his heart as a souvenir of Mrs.\r\nGisborne; he is requited with an attempt to pinch his nose therewith,\r\nAnd--\r\n\r\n2.30. P. M. Weymouth.--The result was the upset of my ink, whereof you\r\nsee the remains; and our last moments were spent in reparations and\r\napologies.  My two squires are in different plight from what they were\r\nten weeks ago, racing up hills that it then half killed them to come\r\ndown, and lingering wistfully on the top for last glimpses of our bay.\r\nI am overwhelmed with their courtesies, and though each is lugging\r\nabout twenty pounds weight of stones, and Mab besides in Leonard\'s\r\npocket, I am seldom allowed to carry my own travelling bag. Hector has\r\nbeen walking us about while his horses are resting after their twenty\r\nmiles, but we think the parade and pier soon seen, and are tantalized\r\nby having no time for Portland Island, only contenting ourselves with\r\nan inspection of shop fossils, which in company with Hector is a sort\r\nof land of the "Three Wishes," or worse; for on my chancing to praise a\r\nbeautiful lump of Purbeck stone, stuck as full of paludinae as a\r\npudding with plums, but as big as my head and much heavier, he brought\r\nout his purse at once; and when I told him he must either enchant it on\r\nto my nose, or give me a negro slave as a means of transport, Leonard\r\nso earnestly volunteered to be the bearer, that I was thankful for my\r\nold rule against collecting curiosities that I do not find and carry\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n\'August 30th. Maplewood.--I wonder whether these good children can be\r\nhappier, unless it may be when they receive you!  How much they do make\r\nof us! and what a goodly sight at their own table they are! They are\r\ncapable in themselves of making any place charming, though the man must\r\nhave been enterprising who sat down five-and-twenty years ago to\r\nreclaim this park from irreclaimable down.  I asked where were the\r\nmaples? and where was the wood? and was shown five stunted ones in a\r\ncage to defend them from the sheep, the only things that thrive here,\r\nexcept little white snails, with purple lines round their shells.\r\n"There now, isn\'t it awfully bleak?" says Hector, with a certain\r\ncomical exultation.  "How was a man ever to live here without her?"\r\nAnd the best of it is, that Blanche thinks it beautiful--delicious free\r\nair, open space, view over five counties, &c. Inside, one traces\r\nFlora\'s presiding genius, Hector would never have made the concern so\r\nperfect without her help; and Blanche is no child in her own house, but\r\nis older and more at home than Hector, so that one would take her for\r\nthe heiress, making him welcome and at ease.  Not that it is like the\r\nGrange, Blanche is furious if I remark any little unconscious imitation\r\nor similarity--"As if we could be like Flora and George indeed!"  Nor\r\nwill they.  If Blanche rules, it will be unawares to herself.  And\r\nwhere Hector is, there will always be a genial house, overflowing with\r\ngood-humour and good-nature.  He has actually kept the 1st of September\r\nclear of shooting parties that he may take these two boys out, and give\r\nthem a thorough day\'s sport in his turnip-fields.  "License?  Nonsense,\r\nhe thought of that before, and now Aubrey may get some shooting out of\r\nGeorge Rivers." After such good-nature my mouth is shut, though, ay di\r\nme, all the world and his wife are coming here on Monday evening, and\r\nunless I borrow of Blanche, Mrs. Ernescliffe\'s sister will "look like\r\nane scrub."\'\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\'September 2nd.--Train at Stoneborough, 6.30.  That\'s the best news I\r\nhave to give.  Oh, it has been a weary while to be out of sight of you\r\nall, though it has been pleasant enough, and the finale is perfectly\r\nbrilliant.  Blanche, as lady of the house, is a sight to make a sister\r\nproud; she looks as if she were born to nothing else, and is a model of\r\nprettiness and elegance.  Hector kept coming up to me at every\r\nopportunity to admire her.  "Now, old Ethel, look at her? Doesn\'t she\r\nlook like a picture?  I chose that gown, you know;" then again after\r\ndinner, "Well, old Ethel, didn\'t it go off well?  Did you ever see\r\nanything like her?  There, just watch her among the old ladies.  I\r\ncan\'t think where she learnt it all, can you?"  And it certainly was\r\ntoo perfect to have been learnt.  It was not the oppression that poor\r\ndear Flora gives one by doing everything so well, as if she had\r\nperfectly balanced what was due to herself and everybody else; it was\r\njust Blanche, simple and ready, pleasing herself by doing what people\r\nliked, and seeing what they did like. It was particularly pretty to see\r\nhow careful both she and Hector were not to put Leonard aside--indeed,\r\nthey make more of him than of Aubrey, who is quite able to find his own\r\nlevel.  Even his tender feelings as to Mab are respected, and Blanche\r\nalways takes care to invite her to a safe seat on a fat scarlet cushion\r\non the sofa (Mrs. Ledwich\'s wedding present), when the footmen with the\r\ntea might be in danger of demolishing her.  Leonard, and his fine eyes,\r\nand his dog, were rather in fashion yesterday evening.  Blanche put out\r\nhis Coombe sketches for a company trap, and people talked to him about\r\nthem, and he was set to sing with Blanche, and then with some of the\r\nyoung ladies.  He seemed to enjoy it, and his nice, modest,\r\ngentlemanlike manner told.  The party was not at all amiss in itself.\r\nI had a very nice clerical neighbour, and it is a very different thing\r\nto see and hear Hector at the bottom of the table from having poor dear\r\nGeorge there.  But oh! only one dinner more before we see our own table\r\nagain, and Tom at the bottom of it.  Hurrah!  I trust this is the last\r\nletter you will have for many a day, from\r\n\r\n                        \'Your loving and dutiful daughter,\r\n                                                  \'ETHELDRED MAY.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n  The XII statute remember to observe\r\n  For all the paine thou hast for love and wo\r\n  All is too lite her mercie to deserve\r\n  Thou musten then thinke wher er thou ride or go\r\n  And mortale wounds suffre thou also\r\n  All for her sake, and thinke it well besette\r\n  Upon thy love, for it maie not be bette.\r\n                              --Chaucer\'s \'Court of Love\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Good-bye, Leonard,\' said Ethel, as the two families, after mustering\r\nstrong at the station, parted at the head of Minster Street; and as she\r\nfelt the quivering lingering pressure of his hand, she added with a\r\nsmile, \'Remember, any Saturday afternoon.  And you will come for the\r\nbooks.\'\r\n\r\nGlad as she was to be anchored on her father\'s arm, and clustered round\r\nwith rejoicing brothers and sisters, she could not be devoid of a shade\r\nof regret for the cessation of the intimate intercourse of the last\r\nnine weeks, and a certain desire for the continuance of the\r\nconfidential terms that had arisen.  The moment\'s pang was lost in the\r\neager interchange of tidings too minute for correspondence, and in\r\napproval of the renovation of the drawing-room, which was so skilful\r\nthat her first glance would have detected no alteration in the subdued\r\ntones of paper, carpet, and chintz, so complete was their loyalty to\r\nthe spirit of perpetuity.  Flora told no one of the pains that, among\r\nher many cares, she had spent upon those tints, not so much to gratify\r\nEthel, as because her own wearied spirit craved the repose of home\r\nsameness, nor how she had finally sent to Paris for the paper that\r\nlooked so quiet, but was so exquisitely finished, that the whole room\r\nhad a new air of refinement.\r\n\r\nThe most notable novelty was a water-coloured sketch, a labour of love\r\nfrom the busy hands in New Zealand, which had stolen a few hours from\r\ntheir many tasks to send Dr. May the presentment of his namesake\r\ngrandson.  Little Dickie stood before them, a true son of the\r\nhumming-bird sprite, delicately limbed and featured, and with elastic\r\nspringiness, visible even in the pencilled outline.  The dancing dark\r\neyes were all Meta\'s, though the sturdy clasp of the hands, and the\r\ncurl that hung over the brow, brought back the reflection of Harry\'s\r\nbaby days.\r\n\r\nIt would have been a charming picture, even if it had not been by\r\nMeta\'s pencil, and of Norman\'s child, and it chained Ethel for more\r\nthan one interval of longing loving study.\r\n\r\nTom interrupted her in one of these contemplations.  \'Poor Flora,\' he\r\nsaid, with more feeling than he usually allowed to affect his voice,\r\n\'that picture is a hard trial to her.  I caught her looking at it for\r\nfull ten minutes, and at last she turned away with her eyes full of\r\ntears.\'\r\n\r\n\'I do not wonder,\' said Ethel.  \'There is a certain likeness to that\r\npoor little Leonora, and I think Flora misses her more every year.\'\r\n\r\n\'Such a child as Margaret is just the thing to cause the other to be\r\nmissed.\'\r\n\r\n\'What do you think of Margaret this time?\' said Ethel, for Tom alone\r\never durst seriously touch on the undefined impression that all\r\nentertained of Flora\'s only child.\r\n\r\n\'If Flora were only silly about her,\' said Tom, \'one might have some\r\nhope; but unluckily she is as judicious there as in everything else,\r\nand the child gets more deplorable every year.  She has got the look of\r\ndeformity, and yet she is not deformed; and the queer sullen ways of\r\ndeficiency, but she has more wit than her father already, and more\r\ncunning.\'\r\n\r\n\'As long as there is a mind to work on, one hopes\' said Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'I could stand her better if she were foolish!\' exclaimed Tom, \'but I\r\ncan\'t endure to see her come into the room to be courted by every one,\r\nand be as cross as she dares before her mother.  Behind Flora\'s back, I\r\ndon\'t know which she uses worst, her father or her grandfather.  I came\r\ndown upon little Miss at last for her treatment of the Doctor, and\r\nneither he nor Rivers have forgiven me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor child!  I don\'t believe she has ever known a moment\'s thorough\r\nhealth or comfort!  I always hope that with Flora\'s patience and\r\nmanagement she may improve.\'\r\n\r\n\'Pshaw, Ethel! she will always be a misfortune to herself and everybody\r\nelse.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have faith in good coming out of misfortunes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Illustrated, I suppose, by ravings about your young Ward.  Mary is\r\ncrazy about his sister, and the Doctor lunatic as to the brother, who\r\nwill soon kick at him for his pains.\'\r\n\r\n\'I own to thinking Leonard capable of great things.\'\r\n\r\nTom made a grimace equal to what Ethel could do in that way, thrust his\r\nhands deep into his pockets, and philosophically observed, \'Behold the\r\neffects of patronage!  Blind Cupid is nothing to him.\'\r\n\r\nEthel let it pass, caring too much for Leonard to set him up as a mark\r\nfor Tom\'s satire, which was as different from Aubrey\'s as quinine from\r\norange-peel, though properly used, it was a bracing tonic, such as she\r\noften found wholesome.  A cynical younger brother is a most valuable\r\npossession to a woman who has taken a certain position in her own world.\r\n\r\nTom was a sterling character, highly and deeply principled, though not\r\ndemonstrative, and showing his Scots descent.  None of the brothers had\r\nbeen extravagant, but Tom, with the income of his lately achieved\r\nfellowship, performed feats of economy, such as attaining to the\r\npurchase of an ultra perfect microscope, and he was consistently\r\nindustrious, so exactly measuring his own powers that to undertake was\r\nwith him to succeed, and no one suffered anxiety on his account. As Dr.\r\nSpencer said, he was as sure to fall on his legs as a sandy cat, and so\r\nnobody cared for him.  At home he was sufficient to himself, properly\r\nbehaved to his father, civil to Richard, unmerciful in ridicule, but\r\nmerciful in dominion over the rest, except Ethel, whom he treated as an\r\nequal, able to retort in kind, reserving for her his most\r\nhighly-flavoured sallies, and his few and distant approaches to such\r\nconfidence as showed her how little she knew him. His father esteemed\r\nbut did not \'get on with\' him, and his chief and devoted adherent was\r\nAubrey, to whom he was always kind and helpful. In person Tom was tall\r\nand well-made, of intelligent face, of which his spectacles seemed a\r\nnatural feature, well-moulded fine-grained hand, and dress the\r\nperfection of correctness, though the precision, and dandyism had been\r\npruned away.\r\n\r\nEthel would have preferred that Leonard and Averil should not have\r\nwalked in on the Saturday after her return, just when Tom had spread\r\nhis microscope apparatus over the table, and claimed Mary\'s assistance\r\nin setting up objects; and she avoided his eye when Mary and Averil did\r\nwhat he poetically called rushing into each other\'s arms, whilst she\r\nbestowed her greetings on Leonard and Mab.\r\n\r\n\'Then she may come in?\' said Leonard.  \'Henry has banished her from the\r\ndrawing-room, and we had much ado to get her allowed even in the\r\nschoolroom.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is so tiresome,\' said his sister, \'just one of Henry\'s fancies.\'\r\nEthel, thinking this disloyal, remarked that those who disliked dogs in\r\nthe house could not bear them, and did not wonder that Tom muttered\r\n\'Original.\'\r\n\r\n\'But such a little darling as this!\' cried Averil, \'and after Mrs.\r\nErnescliffe had been so kind.  Mary, you must see how clever she is.\r\nLeonard is teaching her to play on the piano.\'\r\n\r\n\'I congratulate you,\' quietly said Tom; and somehow Ethel felt that\r\nthose three words were a satire on her \'capable of great things;\' while\r\nLeonard drew up, and Averil coloured, deferring the exhibition of Mab\'s\r\naccomplishments till \'another time,\' evidently meaning out of Tom\'s\r\npresence.\r\n\r\n\'Aubrey is gone to the Grange with papa,\' Ethel said, glad to lead away\r\nfrom Mab.\r\n\r\n\'He told me he was going,\' said Leonard, \'but he said you would be at\r\nhome.\'\r\n\r\nEthel knew that the intonation of that \'you\' had curled Tom\'s lip with\r\nmischief, and dreading that Leonard should discover and resent his\r\nmood, she said, \'We think one of your sea eggs has got among ours; will\r\nyou come to the schoolroom and see?\'\r\n\r\nAnd leaving Tom to tease and be bored by the young ladies, she led the\r\nway to the schoolroom, where Aubrey\'s fossils, each in its private\r\ntwist of paper, lay in confusion on the floor, whence they were in\r\ncourse of being transferred to the shelf of a cupboard.\r\n\r\nLeonard looked at the disorder with astonished admiration.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Ethel, \'it is a great mess, but they are to have a regular\r\ncabinet, when Richard has time, or Aubrey has money, two equally\r\nunlikely chances.\'\r\n\r\n\'How much does a cabinet cost?\'\r\n\r\n\'Jones would make a plain deal one for about five-and-twenty shillings.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t unpack mine properly,\' said Leonard, disconsolately.  \'Ave is\r\ngoing to make a place for them, but Henry votes them rubbish.\'\r\n\r\n\'They are dreadful rubbish,\' said Ethel.  \'It goes against my\r\nconscience to guard them from the house-maid, and if my sister Flora\r\ncame in here, I should be annihilated.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course one expects that in women.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Richard would be as much distracted!  It is a provision of Nature\r\nthat there should be some tidy ones, or what would the world come to?\'\r\n\r\n\'It would be a great deal less of a bore.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not at all; we should stifle ourselves at last if we had our own way.\r\nNever mind, Leonard, we make them go through quite as much as they make\r\nus.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am sure I hope so.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no, Leonard,\' she said, becoming less playful, \'we must not do it\r\non purpose.  Even unconsciously, we plague the spirits of order quite\r\nenough, and they have the right on their side after all.\'\r\n\r\n\'I think a lady is the person to say what one may do or not in the\r\ndrawing-room; don\'t you?\' said Leonard.\r\n\r\n\'That depends.\'\r\n\r\n\'And you let your brother spread his things all over yours!\'\r\n\r\n\'So I do; but I would not if papa minded it, or even if this were\r\nRichard\'s house, and he did not like it.  Don\'t begin with worries\r\nabout trifles, pray, Leonard.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is not I that care about trifles,\' returned the boy.  \'How was one\r\nto reckon on a man setting up a monomania about dogs\' paws in the hall?\'\r\n\r\n\'I have feared we were rather foolish; I ought to have reminded you to\r\nask whether Mab would be welcome.\'\r\n\r\n\'I was not going to ask leave, I have no one whose leave to ask,\' said\r\nLeonard, in tones at first proud, then sad.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s a bad beginning,\' returned Ethel.  \'As master of the house,\r\nyour brother has a right to your compliance, and if you do not all give\r\nway to each other, you will have nothing but dissension and misery.\'\r\n\r\n\'All to each other; yes, that is fair.\'\r\n\r\n\'He must have given way to you in letting you keep the dog at all in\r\nthe house\' said Ethel.  \'It is a real instance of kindness, and you are\r\nbound to let her be as little in his way as possible.\'\r\n\r\n\'He does mean well, I suppose,\' said Leonard; \'but he is an awful\r\nbother, and poor Ave gets the worst of it.  One has no patience with\r\nfinikin ways in a man.\'\r\n\r\n\'There\'s no telling how much I owe to my finikin brother Richard,\' said\r\nEthel; \'and if you teach Ave to be loyal to the head of your family,\r\nyou will do her as much good as you will do harm by chafing against his\r\nordinances.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t you hate such nonsense, Miss May?\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t love order as much as I honour it.  Set tastes aside.  The\r\npoint is, that if you are to hold together, Leonard, it must be by\r\nbearing and forbearing, and above all, to your elder brother.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, it is a blessing that I shall be in school on Monday.\'\r\n\r\n\'So it is,\' said Ethel; \'but, barring these fidgets, Leonard, tell me,\'\r\nand she looked kindly at him, \'how is it at home?  Better than you\r\nexpected, I hope.\'\r\n\r\n\'Blank enough\' said Leonard; \'I didn\'t think I should have minded the\r\nsound of the surgery door so much.\'\r\n\r\n\'You will have Sunday to help you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, Ave and I have been down to the churchyard; Ave does care, poor\r\ngirl.  She knows better what it is now, and she was glad to have me to\r\ntalk to again, though Miss Mary has been so kind to her.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, nobody can be so much to her as you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor Ave!\' said Leonard, tenderly.  \'And look here, this is my\r\nfather\'s watch, and she made me this chain of my mother\'s hair.  And\r\nthey have given me a photograph of my mother\'s picture; Henry had it\r\ndone long ago, but thought it would upset me to give it before I went\r\naway.  If he could but have guessed how I lay and wished for one!\'\r\n\r\n\'Those are the things one never can guess, even when one would give\r\nworlds to do so.\'\r\n\r\n\'You--O, Miss May, you always know the thing that is comfortable.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said Ethel, \'what will be comfortable now is that you should be\r\nthe man above being affronted by other people\'s nonsense--the only way\r\nto show we did not all spoil each other at Coombe.  Now, here is\r\nWoodstock for you, and tell me if this be not your Cidaris.  Oh, and we\r\nhave found out the name of your funny spiked shell.\'\r\n\r\nTen minutes of palaeontology ensued; and she was leading the way back\r\nto the drawing-room, when he exclaimed, \'Have you heard about the\r\nmatch, Miss May?\'\r\n\r\n\'Match?  Oh, the cricket match?\'\r\n\r\n\'Stoneborough against All England, on St. Matthew\'s Day, so I shall\r\nhave got my hand in.\'\r\n\r\n\'All England meaning every one that can be scraped up that is not\r\nStoneborough,\' returned Ethel.  \'George Larkins has been over here\r\ncanvassing Tom and Aubrey.  But you can\'t be going to play, Leonard;\r\npapa does not half like it for Aubrey.\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps not for Aubrey,\' said Leonard; \'but I am as well as ever, and\r\nluckily they can\'t make up a decent eleven without me.  You will come\r\nand see us, Miss May?  I\'ll find you the jolliest place between the old\r\nlime and the cloister door.\'\r\n\r\n\'As if I had not known the meads ages before your time!\' said Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'I thought you never came to the matches?\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah! you don\'t remember my brothers\' Stoneborough days, when Norman was\r\ncricket mad, and Harry after him, and my father was the best cricketer\r\nin Stoneborough till his accident.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, Dr. May always comes to see the matches,\' said Leonard.  \'You\r\nwill, won\'t you now, Miss May?  I didn\'t think you knew anything about\r\ncricket, but it will be all the better now.\'\r\n\r\nEthel laughed, and half promised.\r\n\r\nCocksmoor existed without Ethel on that holiday; and indeed she was\r\nself-reproachful, though pleased, at finding her presence so great a\r\ntreat to her father.  Leonard might do the honours of the lime-tree\r\nnook, but she spent but little time there, for Dr. May made her walk\r\nabout with him as he exchanged greetings with each and all, while\r\nGertrude led Richard about at her will, and Mary consorted with the\r\nWard girls.  With no one on her mind, Ethel could give free attention\r\nto the smoothly-shaven battle-field, where, within the gray walls\r\nshaded by the overhanging elms, the young champions were throwing all\r\nthe ardour and even the chivalry of their nature into the contest.\r\n\r\nThe annual game had been delayed by the illness in the spring, and the\r\nschool had lost several good players at the end of the half year; but,\r\non the other hand, the holidays being over, George Larkins had been\r\nunable to collect an eleven either in full practice or with public\r\nschool training; and the veteran spectators were mourning the decay of\r\ncricket, and talking of past triumphs.  The school had the first\r\ninnings, which resulted in the discomfiture of Fielder, one of their\r\ncrack champions, and with no great honour to any one except Folliot,\r\nthe Dux, and Leonard Ward, who both acquitted themselves so creditably,\r\nthat it was allowed that if others had done as well, Stoneborough might\r\nhave had a chance.\r\n\r\nBut when \'All England\' went in, the game seemed to be more equally\r\nbalanced.  Aubrey May, in spite of devoted practice under Tom\'s\r\ninstructions, was, from nervous eagerness, out almost as soon as in,\r\nand in his misery of shame and despair felt like the betrayer of his\r\ncause.  But in due time, with the sun declining, and the score still\r\nlow, Tom May came forward, as the last hope of \'All England,\' lissom,\r\nactive, and skilled, walking up to his wicket with the easy confidence\r\nof one not greatly caring, but willing to show the natives what play\r\nmight be.\r\n\r\nAnd his play was admirable; the fortunes of the day began to tremble in\r\nthe balance; every one, spectators and all, were in a state of eager\r\nexcitement; and Aubrey, out of tone and unable to watch for the crisis,\r\nfairly fled from the sight, rushed through the cloister door, and threw\r\nhimself with his face down upon the grass, shivering with suspense.\r\nThere he lay till a sudden burst of voices and cheers showed that the\r\nbattle was over.\r\n\r\nThe result?  He could not believe eyes or ears as he opened the door,\r\nto behold the triumphant gestures of Stoneborough, and the crestfallen\r\nair of his own side, and heard the words, \'Folliot missed two chances\r\nof long-leg--Ward--tremendous rush--caught him out--with only one run\r\nto tie.\'\r\n\r\nDr. May was shaking hands with Leonard in congratulation, not solely\r\ngenerous, for let his sons be where they would, Stoneborough triumphs\r\nwere always the Doctor\'s, and he was not devoid of gratitude to any one\r\nwho would defeat Tom.  Noting, however, the flitting colour, fluttering\r\nbreath, and trembling limbs, that showed the effect of the day\'s\r\nfatigue and of the final exertion, he signed back the boys, and thrust\r\nLeonard within the cloister door, bidding Aubrey fetch his coat, and\r\nEthel keep guard over him, and when he was rested and cooled, to take\r\nhim home to the High Street, where his sisters would meet him.\r\n\r\n\'But--sir--the--supper!\' gasped Leonard, leaning against the door-post,\r\nunable to stand alone.\r\n\r\n\'I dare say.  Keep him safe, Ethel.\'\r\n\r\nAnd the Doctor shut the door, and offered himself to appease the lads\r\nwho were clamouring for the hero of their cause; while Leonard sank\r\nback on the bench, past words or looks for some moments.\r\n\r\n\'You have redeemed your pennon with your last gasp,\' said Ethel, half\r\nreproachfully.\r\n\r\n\'I was determined,\' panted the boy.  \'I don\'t know how I did it.  I\r\ncouldn\'t fail with you looking on.  You did it by coming.\'\r\n\r\nReply was spared by Aubrey\'s return, with the coat in one hand, and a\r\nglass of ale in the other.  \'You are to go home with Ethel at once,\' he\r\npronounced with the utmost zest, \'that is, as soon as you are rested.\r\nMy father says you must not think of the supper, unless you\r\nparticularly wish to be in bed for a week; but we\'ll all drink your\r\nhealth, and I\'ll return thanks--the worst player for the best.\'\r\n\r\nThis was the first time Aubrey had been considered in condition for\r\nsuch festivities, and the gratification of being superior to somebody\r\nmight account for his glee in invaliding his friend.\r\n\r\nCricket suppers were no novelties to Leonard; and either this or his\r\nexhaustion must have made him resign himself to his fate, and walk back\r\nwith Ethel as happily as at Coombe.\r\n\r\nThe sisters soon followed, and were detained to drink tea.  The\r\ncricketers\' mirth must have been fast and furious if it exceeded that\r\nat home, for the Doctor thought himself bound to make up for the loss\r\nto Leonard, put forth all his powers of entertainment, and was\r\ncomically confidential about \'these Etonians that think so much of\r\nthemselves.\'\r\n\r\nAveril was lively and at ease, showing herself the pleasant\r\nwell-informed girl whom Ethel had hitherto only taken on trust, and\r\nacting in a pretty motherly way towards the little sisters.  She was\r\nmore visibly triumphant than was Leonard, and had been much gratified\r\nby a request from the Bankside curate that she would entirely undertake\r\nthe harmonium at the chapel.  She had been playing on it during the\r\nabsence of the schoolmaster, and with so much better effect than he\r\ncould produce, that it had been agreed that he would be best in his\r\nplace among the boys.\r\n\r\n\'Ah!\' said the Doctor, \'two things in one are apt to be like Aubrey\'s\r\ncompromise between walking-stick and camp-stool--a little of neither.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t mean it to be a little of neither with me, Dr. May,\' said\r\nAveril.  \'I shall have nothing to do with my choir on week-days, till I\r\nhave sent these pupils of mine to bed.\'\r\n\r\n\'Are you going to train the choir too?\' asked Leonard.\r\n\r\n\'I must practise with them, or we shall not understand one another;\r\nbesides, they have such a horrid set of tunes, Mr. Scudamour gave me\r\nleave to change them.  He is going to have hymnals, and get rid of Tate\r\nand Brady at once.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah! poor Nahum!\' sighed the Doctor with such a genuine sigh, that\r\nAveril turned round on him in amazement.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Ethel, \'I\'m the only one conservative enough to sympathize\r\nwith you, papa.\'\r\n\r\n\'But does any one approve of the New Version?\' cried Averil, recovering\r\nfrom her speechless wonder.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t come down on me,\' said the Doctor, holding up his hands.  \'I\r\nknow it all; but the singing psalms are the singing psalms to me--and I\r\ncan\'t help my bad taste--I\'m too old to change.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! but, papa, you do like those beautiful hymns that we have now?\'\r\ncried Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! yes, yes, Gertrude, I acquiesce.  They are a great improvement;\r\nbut then, wasn\'t it a treat when I got over to Woodside Church the\r\nother day, and found them singing, "No change of times shall ever\r\nshock"!\' and he began to hum it.\r\n\r\n\'That is the Sicilian Mariners\' hymn,\' said Averil.  \'I can sing you\r\nthat whenever you please.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you; on condition you sing the old Tate and Brady, not your "O\r\nSanctissma, O Purissima,"\' said the Doctor, a little mischievously.\r\n\r\n\'Which is eldest, I wonder?\' said Ave, smiling, pleased to comply with\r\nany whim of his; though too young to understand the associations that\r\nentwine closely around all that has assisted or embodied devotion.\r\n\r\nThe music went from the sacred to the secular; and Ethel owned that the\r\nperfectly pronounced words and admirable taste made her singing very\r\ndifferent from that which adorned most dinner-parties.  Dr. May\r\nintensely enjoyed, and was between tears and bravos at the charge of\r\nthe Six Hundred, when the two brothers entered, and stood silently\r\nlistening.\r\n\r\nThat return brought a change.  Aubrey was indeed open and bright,\r\nbursting out with eager communications the moment the song ceased, then\r\nturning round with winning apologies, and hopes that he was not\r\ninterrupting; but Tom looked so stiff and polite as to chill every one,\r\nand Averil began to talk of the children\'s bed-time.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor and Aubrey pressed for another song so earnestly that she\r\nconsented; but the spirit and animation were gone, and she had no\r\nsooner finished than she made a decided move to depart, and Dr. May\r\naccompanied the party home.\r\n\r\n\'Is my father going to put that fellow to bed?\' said Tom, yawning, as\r\nif injured by the delay of bed-time thus occasioned.\r\n\r\n\'Your courtesy does not equal his,\' said Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'Nor ever will,\' said Tom.\r\n\r\n\'Never,\' said Ethel, so emphatically that she nettled him into adding,\r\n\r\n\'He is a standing warning against spoiling one\'s patients.  I wouldn\'t\r\nhave them and their whole tag-rag and bobtail about my house for\r\nsomething!\'\r\n\r\n\'O, Tom, for shame!\' cried Mary, bursting out in the wrath he had\r\nintended to excite.\r\n\r\n\'Ask him which is tag, which rag, and which bobtail,\' suggested Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'Mab, I suppose,\' said Gertrude, happily closing the discussion, but it\r\nwas re-animated by her father\'s arrival.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s a nice girl,\' he said, \'very nice; but we must not have her too\r\noften in the evening, Mary, without Henry.  It is not fair to break up\r\npeople\'s home party.\'\r\n\r\n\'Bobber than bobtail,\' murmured Tom, with a gesture only meant for\r\nEthel.\r\n\r\n\'Ave said he would be out till quite late, papa,\' said Mary, in\r\nself-defence.\r\n\r\n\'She ought to have been back before him,\' said Dr. May.  \'He didn\'t\r\nseem best pleased to have found her away, and let me tell you, young\r\nwoman, it is hard on a man who has been at work all day to come home\r\nand find a dark house and nobody to speak to.\'\r\n\r\nMary looked melancholy at this approach to reproof, and Tom observed in\r\nan undertone,\r\n\r\n\'Never mind, Mary, it is only to give papa the opportunity of improving\r\nhis pupil, while you exchange confidence with your bosom friend.  I\r\nshall be gone in another month, and there will be nothing to prevent\r\nthe perfect fusion of families.\'\r\n\r\nNo one was sorry that the evening here came to an end.\r\n\r\n\'I hope,\' said Dr. May at the Sunday\'s dinner, \'that the cricket match\r\nhas not done for that boy; I did not see him among the boys.\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said Mary, \'but he has met with some accident, and has the most\r\nterrible bruised face.  Ave can\'t make out how he did it.  Do you know,\r\nAubrey?\'\r\n\r\nThe Doctor and his two sons burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\'I thought,\' said Ethel, rather grieved, \'that those things had gone\r\nout of fashion.\'\r\n\r\n\'So Ethel\'s protege, or prodigy, which is it?\' said Tom, \'is turning\r\nout a muscular Christian on her hands.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is a muscular Christian one who has muscles, or one who trusts in\r\nmuscles?\' asked Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'Or a better cricketer than an Etonian?\' added the Doctor.\r\n\r\nTom and Aubrey returned demonstrations that Eton\'s glory was\r\nuntarnished, and the defeat solely owing to \'such a set of sticks.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aubrey,\' said Ethel, in their first private moment, \'was this a fight\r\nin a good cause? for if so, I will come down with you and see him.\'\r\n\r\nAubrey made a face of dissuasion, ending in a whistle.\r\n\r\n\'Do at least tell me it is nothing I should be sorry for,\' she said\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\nHe screwed his face into an intended likeness of Ethel\'s imitation of\r\nan orchis, winked one eye, and looked comical.\r\n\r\n\'I see it can\'t be really bad,\' said Ethel, \'so I will rest on your\r\nassurance, and ask no indiscreet questions.\'\r\n\r\n\'You didn\'t see, then?\' said Aubrey, aggrieved at the failure of his\r\nimitation.  \'You don\'t remember the beauty he met at Coombe?\'\r\n\r\n\'Beauty!  None but Mab.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, they found it out and chaffed him.  Fielder said he would cut\r\nout as good a face out of an old knob of apple wood, and the doctor in\r\npetticoats came up again; he got into one of his rages, and they had no\r\nend of a shindy, better than any, they say, since Lake and Benson\r\nfifteen years ago; but Ward was in too great a passion, or he would\r\nhave done for Fielder long before old Hoxton was seen mooning that way.\r\nSo you see, if any of the fellows should be about, it would never do\r\nfor you to be seen going to bind up his wounds, but I can tell him you\r\nare much obliged, and all that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Obliged, indeed!\' said Ethel.  \'What, for making me the laughing-stock\r\nof the school?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, indeed,\' cried Aubrey, distressed.  \'He said not a word--they only\r\nfound it out--because he found that seat for you, and papa sent him\r\naway with you.  They only meant to poke fun, and it was his caring that\r\nmade it come home to him.  I wonder you don\'t like to find that such a\r\nfellow stood up for you.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t like to be made ridiculous.\'\r\n\r\n\'Tom does not know it, and shall not,\' eagerly interposed Aubrey.\r\n\r\n\'Thank you,\' said she, with all her heart.\r\n\r\n\'Then don\'t be savage.  You know he can\'t help it if he does think you\r\nso handsome, and it is very hard that you should be affronted with him,\r\njust when he can\'t see out of one of his eyes.\'\r\n\r\n\'For that matter,\' said Ethel, her voice trembling, \'one likes\r\ngenerosity in any sort of a cause; but as to this, the only way is to\r\nlaugh at it.\'\r\n\r\nAubrey thought this \'only way\' hardly taken by the cachinnation with\r\nwhich she left him, for he was sure that her eyes were full of tears;\r\nand after mature consideration he decided that he should only get into\r\na fresh scrape by letting Leonard know that she was aware of the combat\r\nand its motive.\r\n\r\n\'If I were ten years younger, this might be serious,\' meditated Ethel.\r\n\'Happily, it is only a droll adventure for me in my old age, and I have\r\nheard say that a little raving for a grown-up woman is a wholesome sort\r\nof delusion, at his time of life.  So I need not worry about it, and it\r\nis pretty and touching while it lasts, good fellow!\'\r\n\r\nEthel had, in fact, little occasion to worry herself; for all special\r\nmanifestations of Leonard\'s devotion ceased.  Whether it were that Tom\r\nwith his grave satirical manner contrived to render the house\r\ndisagreeable to both brother and sister, or whether Leonard\'s boyish\r\nbashfulness had taken alarm, and his admiration expended itself in the\r\nbattle for her charms, there was no knowing.  All that was certain was,\r\nthat the Wards seldom appeared at Dr. May\'s, although elsewhere Mary\r\nand Aubrey saw a great deal of their respective friends, and through\r\nboth, Ethel heard from time to time of Leonard, chiefly as working hard\r\nat school, but finding that his illness had cost him not only the last\r\nhalf year\'s learning, but some memory and power of application.  He was\r\nmerging into the ordinary schoolboy--a very good thing for him no\r\ndoubt, though less beautiful than those Coombe fancies.  And what were\r\nthey worth?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n  Little specks of daily trouble--\r\n  Petty grievance, petty strife--\r\n  Filling up with drops incessant\r\n  To the brim the cup of life.\r\n\r\n  Deeper import have these trifles\r\n  Than we think or care to know:\r\n  In the air a feather floating,\r\n  Tells from whence the breezes blow.--REV. G. MONSELL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first brightening of the orphaned house of Bankside had been in\r\nLeonard\'s return.  The weeks of his absence had been very sore ones to\r\nAveril, while she commenced the round of duties that were a heavy\r\nburthen for one so young, and became, instead of the petted favourite,\r\nthe responsible head of the house.\r\n\r\nShe was willing and glad to accept the care of her little\r\nsisters--docile bright children--who were pleased to return to the\r\norderly habits so long interrupted, and were so intelligent, that her\r\ntask of teaching was a pleasant one; and almost motherly love towards\r\nthem grew up as she felt their dependence on her, and enjoyed their\r\ncaresses.\r\n\r\nWith Henry she had less in common.  He expected of her what she had not\r\nlearnt, and was not willing to acquire.  A man interfering in the\r\nwoman\'s province meets little toleration; and Henry was extremely\r\nprecise in his requirements of exact order, punctuality, and\r\nexcellence, in all the arrangements of his house.  While breaking her\r\nin to housekeeping, he made himself appear almost in the light of a\r\ntask-master--and what was worse, of a despised task-master.  Averil\r\nthought she could not respect a brother whose displeasure was\r\nmanifested by petulance, not sternness, and who cared not only about\r\nhis dinner, but about the tidy appearance of the drawing-room--nay, who\r\ncalled that tasty which she thought vulgar, made things stiff where she\r\nmeant them to be easy and elegant, and prepared the place to be the\r\nbutt of Tom May\'s satire.\r\n\r\nHenry was not a companion to her.  His intellect was lower, his\r\neducation had not been of the same order, and he had not the manly\r\nforce of character that makes up for everything in a woman\'s eyes.\r\nWhere she had talents, he had pretensions--just enough to make his\r\njudgments both conceited and irritating; and where her deeper thoughts\r\nand higher aspirations were concerned, she met either a blank or a\r\ngrowing jealousy of the influence of the clergy and of the May family.\r\n\r\nYet Henry Ward was really a good brother, sacrificing much to his\r\norphan sisters, and living a moral and religious life--such as gained\r\nfor him much credit, and made Mrs. Ledwich congratulate Averil on the\r\ngreat excellence and kindness of her incomparable brother.\r\n\r\nAveril assented, and felt it a dreary thing to have an incomparable\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nBut when Leonard came home, the face of the house was changed.  Now she\r\nhad something to look forward to.  Now there was something to hear that\r\nstirred her deeper feelings--some one who would understand and\r\nrespond--some one to make common cause with.  Little as she saw of the\r\nschoolboy, there was life in her day, for sympathy and comprehension\r\nhad come home with him.\r\n\r\nAfter all, there were recesses in Leonard\'s confidence to which Ave did\r\nnot penetrate; but there was quite enough to be very happy upon,\r\nespecially those visions that had been built on the Melanesian letters.\r\nThey were not near enough to terrify her with the thought of\r\nseparation, and she was sufficiently imbued with Mary May\'s sentiments\r\nto regard mission-work as the highest ambition.  Leonard\'s strong will\r\nand manly disposition would have obtained her homage and affection,\r\neven without the lofty sentiments and the lesser graces that made the\r\nbrother and sister thoroughly suited to one another; and the bond of\r\nunion was unfortunately cemented by equal annoyance at Henry\'s\r\npeculiarities.\r\n\r\nIt certainly was rather hard on a young head of a family to have a\r\nyounger brother his superior in every respect, and with an inseparable\r\nsister.  That Henry had not found out Leonard\'s superiority was no\r\nreason that it should not gall him; and his self-assertions were apt to\r\nbe extremely irritating.  Even in the first flush of welcome, he had\r\nmade it plain that he meant to be felt as master of the house, and to\r\nenforce those petty regulations of exact order that might be easily\r\nborne from a mother, or played with in a sister--would be obeyed\r\ngrudgingly from a father, but could be intolerable in a brother.\r\n\r\nThe reception of Mab and the ammonites was but an earnest of similar\r\nungracious acts on the one hand, and aggressions on the other, often\r\nunintentional.  Averil did, indeed, smooth matters, but she shared\r\nLeonard\'s resentment, and outward submission was compensated by murmur\r\nand mockery in private.\r\n\r\nStill the household worked on fairly; and Mrs. Ledwich was heard to\r\ndeclare, with tears in her eyes, that it was beautiful to see such a\r\nhappy family of love as those dear young Wards!\r\n\r\n\'The happy family--in Trafalgar Square!\' muttered Dr. Spencer.\r\n\r\nThe confidence of the happy family was on this wise.  When Leonard came\r\nhome with his unpresentable face, he baffled all Ave\'s anxious\r\nquestions, and she was only enlightened by Henry\'s lamentations, in his\r\nabsence, over the hopelessness of a brother who was so low and vulgar\r\nas to box!  Her defence being met by a sneer, she flew to tell Leonard\r\nof the calumny, and was laughed at for her innocence, but extorted that\r\nhe had fought with a fellow that talked impudently of some of the\r\nMays--cause fully sufficient in her eyes; nor did Henry utter any open\r\nreproof, though he contrived to exasperate his brother into fierce\r\nretort and angry gesture by an unnecessary injunction not to show that\r\nungentlemanly face.\r\n\r\nFull consciousness of the difficulties presented by the characters of\r\nthe two brothers would have been far too oppressive; and perhaps it was\r\nbetter for Averil that she had it not, but had her own engrossing\r\ninterests and employments drawing off her attention and enlivening her\r\nspirits.  Her church music was her object in life--the dedication of\r\nthe talent that had been cultivated at so much time and cost, and the\r\ngreatest honour and enjoyment she could imagine, and she had full\r\nparticipation from Leonard, who had a hearty love for sacred music,\r\nreadily threw himself into her plans, and offered voice and taste to\r\nassist her experiments.  Nor had her elder brother any objection to her\r\nbeing thus brought forward: he was proud of her performance, and\r\ngratified with the compliments it elicited; and all went well till the\r\nnew hymnals arrived, and books upon books, full of new tunes, anthems,\r\nand chants, were accumulating on the music-stand.\r\n\r\n\'What are you about there all the evening, not opening your lips?\'\r\n\r\n\'Leonard is writing out his verses, and I am copying music.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wonder you neither of you will remember that that table was never\r\nmeant to be littered over with all sorts of rubbish!\'\r\n\r\n\'I thought tables were to put things on,\' returned Leonard coolly.\r\n\r\n\'Drawing-room tables were not made to be inked!  That cover will be\r\nruined in a day or two!\'\r\n\r\n\'Very well--then we\'ll pay for it!\' said Leonard, in the same\r\naggravating tone.\r\n\r\n\'Here are newspapers spread between it and the ink,\' said Averil,\r\ndisplaying them with an air of injured innocence that made Henry\r\nsubside; but he presently exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\'Is that copying to go on all night?  Can\'t you speak, nor play\r\nanything, to send one off to sleep?\'\r\n\r\nWith a martyr look, yet a satirical glance, Averil opened the piano;\r\nand Henry settled himself in the master\'s arm-chair, as one about to\r\nenjoy well-earned rest and entertainment after a hard day\'s work.\r\n\r\n\'I say, what doleful drone have you there!\'\r\n\r\n\'I am trying a new chant for the "Nunc Dimittis".\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothing but that day and night!  Give us something worth hearing.\'\r\n\r\n\'I thought you only wanted to go to sleep.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t want to dream myself into church, listening to Scudamour\'s\r\nproses: I\'ve quite enough of that on Sunday.\'\r\n\r\nAve began to play one of her school waltzes; and the touch of her\r\nfingers on the keys had so sharp-edged and petulant a tone, that\r\nLeonard smiled to himself as he ran his fingers through his hair over\r\nhis books.  Nor was it soothing to Henry, who, instead of going to\r\nsleep, began to survey the room, and get food for annoyance.\r\n\r\n\'I say,\' said he, looking across at a little brass-barred bookcase of\r\nornamental volumes on the opposite chiffonniere, \'what book is out\r\nthere?\'\r\n\r\n\'Scott\'s "Lay",\' said Leonard; \'it is up in my room.\'\r\n\r\n\'I told you, Ave, not to let the drawing-room books be carried about\r\nthe house to be spoilt!\' said Henry, who seldom reproved his brother\r\ndirect, but generally through Ave.\r\n\r\n\'You\'d better get some made of wood then,\' said Leonard.\r\n\r\n\'Remember then, Ave, I say I will not have my books taken out, and left\r\nabout over the house.\'\r\n\r\nLeonard dashed out of the room passionately, and presently came\r\nthundering down again, every step audible the whole way, and threw the\r\nbook on the table, bringing in a whirlwind, and a flaring sloping\r\ncandle dropping upon the precious cloth.  Henry started up and pointed.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m glad of it!\' exclaimed Leonard; \'it will be a little amusement for\r\nyou.  Good night, Ave!  I\'m going to finish up-stairs, since one can\'t\r\nread, write, or touch a book without your being rowed!\'\r\n\r\nHe was gone, and Averil, though rather frightened, gave him infinite\r\ncredit for keeping his temper; and perhaps he deserved it, considering\r\nthe annoyance and the nature of the provocation; but she did not\r\nreflect how much might have been prevented by more forethought and less\r\npre-occupation.  She said not a word, but quietly returned to her\r\ncopying; and when Henry came with paper and poker to remove the damage,\r\nshe only shoved back her chair, and sat waiting, pen in hand, resigned\r\nand ironical.\r\n\r\n\'I declare,\' grumbled Henry, as he examined the remaining amount of\r\ndamage, \'these day-schools are a great inconvenience; there\'s no\r\nkeeping a place fit to be seen with a great uncivilized lad always\r\nhanging about!\'\r\n\r\n\'Leonard is considered particularly gentlemanlike,\' said Ave, with lips\r\ncompressed, to keep back something about old bachelors.\r\n\r\n\'Now, I should have thought a lady would have some regard to her own\r\ndrawing-room, and object to slovenliness--elbows on table, feet\r\neverywhere!\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothing is in worse taste than constraint,\' said Ave from the corners\r\nof her mouth--\'at least for those that can trust their manners without\r\nit.\'\r\n\r\n\'I tell you, Ave, you are spoiling the boy.  He is more conceited than\r\never since the Mays noticed him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Leonard conceited!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; he is getting as stuck up as Tom May himself--your model I\r\nbelieve!\'\r\n\r\n\'I thought he was yours!\'\r\n\r\n\'Mine?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; you always seem to aim at a poor imitation of him.\'\r\n\r\nThere was a blushing angry stammer in reply; and she suppressed her\r\nsmile, but felt triumphant in having hit the mark.  Unready at retort,\r\nhe gathered himself up, and said: \'Well, Ave, I have only this to say,\r\nthat if you choose to support that boy in his impertinences, there will\r\nbe no bearing it; and I shall see what I shall do.\'\r\n\r\nSeeing what shall be done is a threat stimulating to some, but\r\nappalling to others; and Averil was of the latter class, with no desire\r\nfor such a spectacle, be it what it might.  She did not apologize for\r\nthe trifle--possible ink, a spot of wax, a borrowed book, were far\r\nbeneath an apology; but she made up her mind to humour Henry\'s follies\r\nmagnanimously, and avoid collisions, like an admirable peace-maker.  As\r\nsoon as bed-time came, she repaired to Leonard\'s room; and Henry, as he\r\nwent along the passage, heard the two young voices ringing with\r\nlaughter!  Her retort had been particularly delightful to Leonard.\r\n\'That\'s right, Ave!  I\'m glad you set him down, for I thought\r\nafterwards whether I ought not to have stood by you, only his way of\r\npitching into me through you puts me into such a rage: I shall do\r\nsomething desperate some day!\'\r\n\r\n\'Never mind it, Leonard; it does not hurt me; and if it did, I should\r\nlike to bear a great deal for you.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s all the wrong way,\' said Leonard, smiling affectionately.\r\n\r\n\'No; men do and women suffer.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s trite!\' said Leonard, patting her fondly.  \'I like you to\r\ndo--as you call it--Miss May does, and every one that is worth\r\nanything. I say, Ave, when I go out to the islands, you are coming too?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes!  I know I could do a great deal.  If nothing else, I could\r\nsing; and they have a great aptitude for singing, Mary was telling me.\r\nBut that reminds me I must finish copying the hymn for next Sunday;\r\nHenry hindered me, and I have six copies more to do.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll do some of them,\' said Leonard.  \'Let us go down now the coast is\r\nclear, if the fire is not out.\'\r\n\r\nThey went down softly, Mab and all, nursed up the fire that Henry had\r\nraked out; and if Saturnalia could be held over the writing out of a\r\nhymn tune, they did it!  At any rate, it had the charm of an assertion\r\nof independence; and to Averil it was something like a midnight meeting\r\nof persecuted Christians--to Leonard it was \'great fun.\'\r\n\r\nThat evening was not a solitary specimen.\r\n\r\nAveril and Leonard intended to obviate causes of offence; but they were\r\nyoung and heedless, and did not feel bound to obedience.  A very little\r\ntemptation made them forget or defy Henry\'s fancies; and Leonard was\r\neasily lashed into answers really unbecoming and violent, for which he\r\ncould not bring himself to be sorry, when he thought over the petty\r\ninterference and annoyance that had caused them.\r\n\r\nThese small tyrannies and frets made Averil the more devoted to the\r\nmusic, which was her rest, her delight, and not only exalted her above\r\ncares, but sanctioned her oblivion of them.  The occupation grew upon\r\nher, never ending, still beginning, with fresh occasions for practice\r\nand new lessons, but though Bankside boys were willing to be taught,\r\nyet it was chiefly in hope of preferment as choristers at the Minster;\r\nand she soon found that a scholar no sooner proved his voice good for\r\nanything, than he went off to be trained for the choir on the\r\nfoundation, which fed, clothed, and apprenticed its young singers.  She\r\nfound she must betake herself to an elder race if she wanted a reliable\r\nstaff of voices; and some young men and women showing themselves\r\nwilling, a practice, with Mr. Scudamour to keep order, was organized\r\nfor late evenings, twice in the week.  This was rather much!  Henry\r\nopposed at first, on the ground that the evening would be broken up; to\r\nwhich she answered that for such a purpose they ought to be willing to\r\nsacrifice a little domestic comfort; and when he muttered a petulant\r\n\'Pshaw,\' looked at him in reproof for sacrilege.  She was not going to\r\nbe one of the womankind sitting up in a row till their lords and\r\nmasters should be pleased to want them!\r\n\r\nNext, he insisted that he would not have her going about the place\r\nafter dark, but she was fortified by the curate\'s promise to escort her\r\nsafely, and reduced him to a semi-imprecation which she again viewed as\r\nextremely wicked.  The existence of that meek little helpless Mrs.\r\nScudamour, always shut up in a warm room with her delicate baby, cut\r\noff Henry from any other possible objection, and he was obliged to\r\nsubmit.\r\n\r\nLeonard would gladly have been his sister\'s companion on her\r\nexpeditions, but he must remain at home and prepare for the morrow\'s\r\nschool-work, and endure the first hour of dreariness unenlivened by her\r\nsmile and greeting, and, what was worse, without the scanty infusion of\r\npeace produced by her presence.  Her rapid departure after dinner\r\nalways discomposed Henry; and the usual vent for his ill-humour was\r\neither a murmur against the clergy and all their measures, or the\r\ndiscovery of some of Leonard\'s transgressions of his code.  Fretted and\r\nirritable at the destruction of evening comfort, he in his turn teased\r\nthe fiery temper of his brother.  If there were nothing worse, his\r\ngrumbling remarks interrupted, and too often they were that sort of\r\ncensure that is expressively called nagging. Leonard would reply\r\nangrily, and the flashes of his passion generally produced silence.\r\nNeither brother spoke to Averil of these evening interludes, which were\r\nbecoming almost habitual, but they kept Leonard in a constant sore\r\nsense of injury, yet of uneasy conscience. He looked to the Randall\r\nscholarship as his best hope of leaving home and its torments, but his\r\nillness had thrown him back: he had not only lost the last quarter, but\r\nthe acquirements of the one before it were obscured; and the vexations\r\nthemselves so harassed and interrupted his evening studies, that he\r\nknew it was unreasonable to hope for it at the next examination, which,\r\nfrom various causes, was to come after the Christmas holidays; and it\r\nwould be well if he could even succeed in the summer.\r\n\r\nInnocent as the Mays were of the harmonium business, Henry included\r\nthem in the annoyance it gave.  It was the work of the curate--and was\r\nnot Dr. May one in everything with the clergy? had he not been\r\ninstrumental in building the chapel? was it not the Mays and the clergy\r\nwho had made Ave inconveniently religious and opinionative, to say\r\nnothing of Leonard? The whole town was priest--led and bigoted; and Dr.\r\nMay was the despot to whom all bowed down.\r\n\r\nThis was an opinion Henry would hardly have originated: it was the\r\nshaft of an abler man than he--no other than Harvey Anderson, who had\r\nlately become known to the world by a book proving King John to have\r\nbeen the most enlightened and patriotic of English sovereigns, enduring\r\nthe Interdict on a pure principle of national independence, and\r\ndevising Magna Charta from his own generous brain--in fact, presenting\r\na magnificent and misunderstood anticipation of the most advanced\r\ntheories of the nineteenth century.  The book had made so much noise in\r\nthe world, that the author had been induced to quit his college\r\ntutorship, and become editor of a popular magazine.  He lived in\r\nLondon, but often came down to spend Sunday with his mother, and had\r\nbegun to be looked on as rather the lion of the place.  Henry took in\r\nhis magazine, and courted his notice, often bringing him into Averil\'s\r\nway that she might hear her heroes treated with irony more effectual\r\nthan home-made satire; but Ave was staunch.  She hated the sight of Mr.\r\nAnderson; never cut the leaves of his magazine; and if driven to sing\r\nto him, took as little pains as her musical nature would let her do.\r\nBut the very strength of her dislike gave it an air of prejudice, and\r\nit was set down less to principle than to party spirit and May\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nThere was another cause for Henry\'s being soured.  He was not of the\r\nnature to be filial with Dr. May; and therefore gratitude oppressed,\r\nand patronage embittered him.  The first months of warm feeling at an\r\nend, the old spirit of independence revived, and he avoided consulting\r\nthe physician as much as possible.  More than once his management of a\r\ncase was not approved by Dr. May; and the strong and hasty language,\r\nand the sharp reproofs that ensued, were not taken as the signs of the\r\nwarm heart and friendly interest, but as the greatest\r\noffences--sullenly, but not the less bitterly endured.\r\n\r\nMoreover, one of the Whitford surgeons had been called in by a few of\r\nthe out-lying families who had hitherto been patients of the Wards; and\r\nworse than all, Mrs. Rivers took her child up to London for three days\r\nin November, and it became known--through a chain of tongues--that it\r\nwas for the enlargement of tonsils, on which Mr. Ward had operated a\r\nyear before.\r\n\r\n\'Old May was playing him false!\' was Henry\'s cry.  \'His professions\r\nwere humbug.  He would endure no one who did not submit to his\r\ndictation; and he would bring in a stranger to ruin them all!\'\r\n\r\nLittle did Henry know of Dr. May\'s near approach to untruth in denying\r\nthat he had a house to let to the opposition surgeon--of his\r\nattestations to his daughter that young Ward was a skilful operator--or\r\nof his vexation when she professed herself ready to undergo anything\r\nfor his pleasure, but said that little Margaret\'s health was another\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nYet even this might have been forgiven, but for that worst rub of\r\nall--Tom May\'s manners.  His politeness was intense--most punctilious\r\nand condescending in form--and yet provoking beyond measure to persons\r\nwho, like Henry and Averil, had not playfulness enough to detect with\r\ncertainty whether they were being made game of or not, nor whether his\r\nsmoothly-uttered compliments were not innuendoes. Henry was certain of\r\nbeing despised, and naturally chafed against the prospect of the future\r\nconnection between the two medical men of the town; and though Tom was\r\ngone back to Cambridge, it was the rankling remembrance of his\r\nsupercilious looks that, more than any present offence or independence\r\nof spirit, made the young surgeon kick against direction from the\r\nphysician.  Here, too, Averil was of the same mind.  She had heard Tom\r\nMay observe that his sister Gertrude would play quite well enough for a\r\nlady; for the mission of a lady\'s music was to put one to sleep at\r\nhome, and cover conversation at a party; as to the\r\nrest--unprofessionals were a mistake!\r\n\r\nAfter that, the civil speeches with which Tom would approach the piano\r\nonly added insult to injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n  Ne\'er readier at alarm-bell\'s call,\r\n  Thy burghers rose to man thy wall,\r\n  Than now in danger shall be thine,\r\n  Thy dauntless voluntary line.--Marmion\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Drive fast, Will,\' said Dr. May, hastily stepping into his carriage in\r\nthe early darkness of a December evening.  \'Five already, and he is to\r\nbe there by 5.25.\'\r\n\r\n\'He\' was no other than Harry May, and \'there\' was the station.  With\r\nthe tidings of the terrible fight of Peiho had come a letter from a\r\nmessmate of Harry\'s with an account of his serious wound in the chest,\r\ndescribing it as just short of immediately dangerous.  Another letter\r\nhad notified his amendment, and that he was invalided home, a few\r\ncheery words from Harry himself scrawled at the end showing that his\r\npower was far less than his good-will: and after two months\' waiting\r\nand suspense, a telegram had come from Plymouth, with the words,\r\n\'Stoneborough, 5.25.\'\r\n\r\nIn ignorance as to the state of the traveller, and expecting to find\r\nhim in a condition requiring great care and watching, Dr. May had laid\r\nhis injunctions on the eager family not to rush up to the station en\r\nmasse to excite and overwhelm, but to leave the meeting there entirely\r\nto himself and his brougham.  He had, therefore, been exceedingly\r\nannoyed that one of Henry Ward\'s pieces of self-assertion had delayed\r\nhim unnecessarily at a consultation; and when at last he had escaped,\r\nhe spent most of his journey with his body half out of the window,\r\nhurrying Will Adams, and making noises of encouragement to the horse;\r\nor else in a strange tumult of sensation between hope and fear, pain\r\nand pleasure, suspense and thankfulness, the predominant feeling being\r\nvexation at not having provided against this contingency by sending\r\nRichard to the station.\r\n\r\nAfter all the best efforts of the stout old chestnut, he and the train\r\nwere simultaneously at the station, and the passengers were getting out\r\non the opposite platform.  The Doctor made a dash to cross in the rear\r\nof the train, but was caught and held fast by a porter with the angry\r\nexclamation, \'She\'s backing, sir;\' and there he stood in an agony,\r\nfeeling all Harry\'s blank disappointment, and the guilt of it besides,\r\nand straining his eyes through the narrow gaps between the blocks of\r\ncarriages.\r\n\r\nThe train rushed on, and he was across the line the same instant, but\r\nthe blank was his.  Up and down the gas-lighted platform he looked in\r\nvain among the crowd, only his eye suddenly lit on a black case close\r\nto his feet, with the three letters MAY, and the next moment a huge\r\nchest appeared out of the darkness, bearing the same letters, and\r\nlifted on a truck by the joint strength of a green porter, and a pair\r\nof broad blue shoulders.  Too ill to come on--telegraph, mail\r\ntrain--rushed through the poor Doctor\'s brain as he stepped forward as\r\nif to interrogate the chest.  The blue shoulders turned, a ruddy\r\nsun-burnt face lighted up, and the inarticulate exclamation on either\r\nside was of the most intense relief and satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\'Where are the rest?\' said Harry, holding his father\'s hand in no sick\r\nman\'s grasp.\r\n\r\n\'At home, I told them not to come up; I thought--\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, we\'ll walk down together!  I\'ve got you all to myself.  I\r\nthought you had missed my telegram.  Hollo, Will, how d\'ye do? what,\r\nthis thing to drive down in?\'\r\n\r\n\'I thought you were an invalid, Harry,\' said Dr. May, with a laughing\r\nyet tearful ring in his agitated tone, as he packed himself and his son\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\'Ay!  I wished I could have let you know sooner how well I had got over\r\nit,\' said Harry, in the deep full voice of strong healthy manhood.  \'I\r\nam afraid you have been very anxious.\'\r\n\r\n\'We are used to it, my boy,\' said the Doctor huskily, stroking the\r\ngreat firm fingers that were lying lovingly on his knee, \'and if it\r\nalways ends in this way, it ought to do us more good than harm.\'\r\n\r\n\'It has not done harm, I hope,\' said Harry, catching him up quick. \'Not\r\nto old Mary?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, Mary works things off, good girl.  I flatter myself you will find\r\nus all in high preservation.\'\r\n\r\n\'All--all at home!  That\'s right.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, those infants from Maplewood and all.  You are sure you are all\r\nright, Harry?\'\r\n\r\n\'As sure as my own feelings can make me, and the surgeon of the Dexter\r\nto back them,\' said Harry.  \'I don\'t believe my lungs were touched\r\nafter all, but you shall all sit upon me when you like--Tom and all.\r\nIt was a greater escape than I looked for,\' he added, in a lower voice.\r\n\'I did not think to have had another Christmas here.\'\r\n\r\nThe silence lasted for the few moments till the carriage drew up behind\r\nthe limes; the doors were thrown open, and the Doctor shouted to the\r\ntimid anxious figure that alone was allowed to appear in the hall,\r\n\'Come and lift him out, Mary.\'\r\n\r\nThe drawing-room was a goodly sight that evening; and the Doctor, as he\r\nsat leaning back in weary happiness, might be well satisfied with the\r\nbright garland that still clustered round his hearth, though the age of\r\nalmost all forbade their old title of Daisies.  The only one who still\r\nasserted her right to that name was perched on the sailor\'s knee,\r\ninsisting on establishing that there was as much room for her there as\r\nthere had been three years ago; though, as he had seated himself on a\r\nlow foot-stool, her feet were sometimes on the ground, and moreover her\r\nthrone was subject to sudden earthquakes, which made her, nothing loth,\r\ncling to his neck, draw his arm closer round her, and lean on his broad\r\nbreast, proud that universal consent declared her his likeness in the\r\nfamily; and the two presenting a pleasant contrasting similarity--the\r\nopen honest features, blue eyes, and smile, expressive of hearty\r\ngood-will and simple happiness, were so entirely of the same mould in\r\nthe plump, white-skinned, rosy-cheeked, golden-haired girl, and in the\r\nlarge, powerful, bronzed, ruddy sailor, with the thick mass of curls,\r\nat which Tom looked with hostility as fixed, though less declared, than\r\nthat of his Eton days.\r\n\r\nThose were the idle members upon the hearth-rug.  On the sofa, with a\r\nsmall table to herself, and a tall embroidery frame before her, nearly\r\nhiding her slight person, sat Mrs. Ernescliffe, her pretty head\r\noccasionally looking out over the top of her work to smile an answer,\r\nand her artistically arranged hair and the crispness of her white dress\r\nand broad blue ribbons marking that there was a step in life between\r\nher and her sisters; her husband sat beside her on the sofa, with a red\r\nvolume in his hand, with \'Orders,\' the only word visible above the\r\nfingers, one of which was keeping his place. Hector looked very happy\r\nand spirited, though his visage was not greatly ornamented by a\r\nmoustache, sandier even than his hair, giving effect to every freckle\r\non his honest face.  A little behind was Mary, winding one of Blanche\'s\r\nsilks over the back of a chair, and so often looking up to revel in the\r\ncontemplation of Harry\'s face, that her skein was in a wild tangle,\r\nwhich she studiously concealed lest the sight should compel Richard to\r\ncome and unravel it with those wonderful fingers of his.\r\n\r\nRichard and Ethel were arranging the \'sick albums\' which they had\r\nconstructed--one of cheap religious prints, with texts and hymns, to be\r\nlent in cases of lingering illness; the other, commonly called the\r\n\'profane,\' of such scraps as might please a sick child, pictures from\r\nworn-out books or advertisements, which Ethel was colouring--Aubrey\r\nvolunteering aid that was received rather distrustfully, as his love of\r\neffect caused him to array the model school-children in colours gaudy\r\nenough, as Gertrude complained, \'to corrupt a saint.\'  Nor was his\r\ndilettante help more appreciated at a small stand, well provided with\r\ntiny drawers, and holding a shaded lamp, according to Gertrude,\r\n\'burning something horrible ending in gen, that would kill anybody but\r\nTom, who managed it,\' but which threw a beautiful light upon the\r\nvarious glass dishes, tubes, and slides, and the tall brass microscope\r\nthat Tom was said to love better than all his kith and kin, and which\r\nafforded him occupation for his leisure moments.\r\n\r\n\'I say, Harry,\' he asked, \'did you get my letter?\'\r\n\r\n\'Your letter--of what date?  I got none since Mary\'s of the second of\r\nMay, when every one was down in the fever.  Poor old Ward, I never was\r\nmore shocked; what is become of the young ones?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! you must ask Mary, Miss Ward is a bosom friend of hers.\'\r\n\r\n\'What! the girl that sang like the lark?  I must hear her again.  But\r\nshe won\'t be in tune for singing now, poor thing!  What are they doing?\r\nHenry Ward taken to the practice?  He used to be the dirtiest little\r\nsneak going, but I hope he is mended now.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ask my father,\' said mischievous Tom; and Dr. May answered not, nor\r\nrevealed his day\'s annoyance with Henry.\r\n\r\n\'He is doing his best to make a home for his brother and sisters,\' said\r\nRichard.\r\n\r\n\'My letter,\' said Tom, \'was written in Whitsun week; I wish you had had\r\nit.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ay, it would have been precious from its rarity,\' said Harry.  \'What\r\ncommission did it contain, may I ask?\'\r\n\r\n\'You have not by good luck brought me home a Chinese flea?\'\r\n\r\n\'He has all the fleas in creation,\' said Daisy confidentially, \'cats\'\r\nand dogs\', and hedgehogs\', and human; and you would have been twice as\r\nwelcome if you had brought one.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve brought no present to nobody.  I\'d got my eye on a splendid ivory\r\njunk, for Blanche\'s wedding present, at Canton, but I couldn\'t even\r\nspeak to send any one after it.  You have uncommon bad luck for a\r\nsailor\'s relatives.\'\r\n\r\n\'As long as you bring yourself home we don\'t care,\' said Blanche,\r\ntreating the loss of the junk with far more resignation than did Tom\r\nthat of the flea.\r\n\r\n\'If you only had a morsel of river mud sticking anywhere,\' added Tom,\r\n\'you don\'t know the value the infusoria might be.\'\r\n\r\n\'I had a good deal more than a morsel sticking to me once,\' said Harry;\r\n\'it was owing to my boat\'s crew that I am not ever so many feet deep in\r\nit now, like many better men.  They never lost sight of me, and somehow\r\nhauled me out.\'\r\n\r\nGertrude gave him a hug, and Mary\'s eyes got so misty, that her skein\r\nfell into worse entanglements than ever.\r\n\r\n\'Were you conscious?\' asked Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t say.  I\'m clear of nothing but choking and gasping then, and a\r\ngood while after.  It was a treacherous, unlucky affair, and I\'m afraid\r\nI shall miss the licking of rascally John Chinaman.  If all I heard at\r\nPlymouth is true, we may have work handy to home.\'\r\n\r\n\'At home you may say,\' said his father, \'Dulce et, &c. is our motto.\r\nDidn\'t you know what a nest of heroes we have here to receive you? Let\r\nme introduce you to Captain Ernescliffe, of the Dorset Volunteer Rifle\r\nCorps; Private Thomas May, of the Cambridge University Corps; and Mr.\r\nAubrey Spencer May, for whom I have found a rifle, and am expected to\r\nfind a uniform as soon as the wise heads have settled what colour will\r\nbe most becoming.\'\r\n\r\n\'Becoming!  No, papa!\' indignantly shouted Aubrey: \'it is the colour\r\nthat will be most invisible in skirmishing.\'\r\n\r\n\'Gray, faced with scarlet,\' said Hector, decidedly.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, that is the colour of the invincible Dorsets,\' said Dr. May.\r\n\'There you see our great authority with his military instructions in\r\nhis hand.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, sir,\' replied Hector, \'it\'s not military instructions, it is\r\nCrauford\'s General Orders.\'\r\n\r\n\'And,\' added the Doctor, \'there\'s his bride working the colours, and\r\nMary wanting to emulate her.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think George will ever permit us to have colours,\' said Ethel;\r\n\'he says that Rifles have no business with them, for that they are of\r\nno use to skirmishers.\'\r\n\r\n\'The matter has been taken out of George\'s hands,\' said Aubrey; \'there\r\nwould not have been a volunteer in the country if he had his way.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' explained Ethel, \'the real soldier can\'t believe in volunteers,\r\nnor cavalry in infantry; but he is thoroughly in for it now.\'\r\n\r\n\'Owing to his Roman matron\' quoth Tom.  \'It was a wonderful opening for\r\npublic spirit when Lady Walkinghame insisted on Sir Henry refusing the\r\nuse of the park for practice, for fear we should make targets of the\r\nchildren.  So the Spartan mother at Abbotstoke, gallantly setting\r\nMargaret aside, sent for the committee at once to choose the very best\r\nplace in the park.\'\r\n\r\n\'Papa is chairman of the committee,\' added Aubrey, \'he is mayor this\r\nyear, so we must encourage it.\'\r\n\r\n\'And Aubrey hit four times at a hundred yards,\' triumphantly declared\r\nGertrude, \'when Edward Anderson and Henry Ward only got a ball in by\r\naccident.\'\r\n\r\n\'Henry Ward ought to be shot at himself,\' was Aubrey\'s sentiment, \'for\r\nnot letting Leonard be in the corps.\'\r\n\r\n\'The fellow that you brought to Maplewood?\' asked Hector.  \'I thought\r\nhe was at school.\'\r\n\r\n\'Didn\'t you know that old Hoxton has given leave to any of the sixth\r\nform to drill and practise? and that trumpery fellow, Henry, says he\r\ncan\'t afford the outfit, though his sister would have given the\r\nuniform.\'\r\n\r\n\'Let me tell you, young folks,\' said the Doctor, \'that you are not to\r\nsuppose it always hails crack rifles on all sorts of improved systems,\r\nas it does when Captain Hector is in the house.\'\r\n\r\n\'They are only on trial, sir,\' apologized Hector.\r\n\r\n\'Very odd then that they all have an eagle and H. E. on them,\' observed\r\nthe Doctor dryly.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! they\'ll take them again, or I shall find a use for them,\' said\r\nHector.\r\n\r\n\'Well, if Henry can\'t afford two,\' said Aubrey, holding to his point,\r\n\'he ought to give up to his brother; he knows no more how to handle a\r\nrifle--\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s the very reason,\' muttered Tom.\r\n\r\n\'And Flora is going to give a great party,\' proceeded Gertrude, \'as\r\nsoon as the uniform is settled, and they are enrolled.  Blanche and\r\nHector are to stay for it, and you\'ll have to wear your lieutenant\'s\r\nuniform, Harry.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t be going to balls till I\'ve been up to report myself fit for\r\nservice,\' said Harry.\r\n\r\n\'It is not to be a ball,\' said Blanche\'s soft, serious voice over her\r\ngreen silk banner; \'it is to be a breakfast and concert, ending in a\r\ndance, such as we had at Maplewood.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hollo!\' said Harry, starting, \'now I begin to believe in Mrs.\r\nErnescliffe, when I hear her drawing down herself as an example to\r\nFlora.\'\r\n\r\n\'Only a precedent,\' said Blanche, blushing a little, but still grave.\r\n\'We have had some experience, you know.  Our corps was one of the\r\nearliest enrolled, and Hector managed it almost entirely.  It was the\r\nreason we have not been able to come here sooner, but we thought it\r\nright to be foremost, as the enemy are sure to attempt our coast first.\'\r\n\r\n\'I believe the enemy are expected on every coast at first,\' was Ethel\'s\r\naside, but it was not heard; for Harry was declaring,\r\n\r\n\'Your coast! they will never get the length of that.  I was talking to\r\nan old messmate of mine in the train, who was telling me how we could\r\nburn their whole fleet before it could get out of Cherbourg.\'\r\n\r\n\'If they should slip by,\' began Hector.\r\n\r\n\'Slip by!\' and Harry had well-nigh dislodged Daisy by his vehemence in\r\ndemonstrating that they were welcome to volunteer, but that the Channel\r\nFleet would prevent the rifles from being seriously put to the proof--a\r\ndeclaration highly satisfactory to the ladies, and heartily backed up\r\nby the Doctor, though Blanche looked rather discomfited, and Hector\r\nargued loud for the probability of active service.\r\n\r\n\'I say, Aubrey,\' said Tom, rather tired of the land and sea debate, \'do\r\njust reach me a card, to take up some of this sand upon.\'\r\n\r\nAubrey obeyed, and reading the black-edged card as he handed it, said,\r\n\'Mrs. Pug.  What?  Pug ought to have been calling upon Mab.\'\r\n\r\n\'Maybe she will, in good earnest,\' observed Tom again in Ethel\'s ear;\r\nwhile the whole room rang with the laughter that always befalls the\r\nunlucky wight guilty of a blunder in a name.\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t mean that you don\'t know who she is, Aubrey!\' was the cry.\r\n\r\n\'I--how should I?\'\r\n\r\n\'What, not Mrs. Pugh?\' exclaimed Daisy.\r\n\r\n\'Pew or Pug--I know nothing of either.  Is this edge as mourning for\r\nall the old pews that have been demolished in the church?\'\r\n\r\n\'For shame, Aubrey,\' said Mary seriously.  \'You must know it is for her\r\nhusband.\'\r\n\r\nAubrey set up his eyebrows in utter ignorance.\r\n\r\n\'How true it is that one half the world knows nothing of the other!\'\r\nexclaimed Ethel.  \'Do you really mean you have never found out the\r\ngreat Mrs. Pugh, Mrs. Ledwich\'s dear suffering Matilda?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve seen a black lady sitting with Mrs. Ledwich in church.\'\r\n\r\n\'Such is life,\' said Ethel.  \'How little she thought herself living in\r\nsuch an unimpressible world!\'\r\n\r\n\'She is a pretty woman enough,\' observed Tom.\r\n\r\n\'And very desirous of being useful,\' added Richard.  \'She and Mrs.\r\nLedwich came over to Cocksmoor this morning, and offered any kind of\r\nassistance.\'\r\n\r\n\'At Cocksmoor!\' cried Ethel, much as if it had been the French.\r\n\r\n\'Every district is filled up here, you know,\' said Richard, \'and Mrs.\r\nLedwich begged me as a personal favour to give her some occupation that\r\nwould interest her and cheer her spirits, so I asked her to look after\r\nthose new cottages at Gould\'s End, quite out of your beat, Ethel, and\r\nshe seemed to be going about energetically.\'\r\n\r\nTom looked unutterable things at Ethel, who replied with a glance\r\nbetween diversion and dismay.\r\n\r\n\'Who is the lady?\' said Blanche.  \'She assaulted me in the street with\r\ninquiries and congratulations about Harry, declaring she had known me\r\nas a child, a thing I particularly dislike:\' and Mrs. Ernescliffe\r\nlooked like a ruffled goldfinch.\r\n\r\n\'Forgetting her has not been easy to the payers of duty calls,\' said\r\nEthel.  \'She was the daughter of Mrs. Ledwich\'s brother, the Colonel of\r\nMarines, and used in old times to be with her aunt; there used to be\r\nurgent invitations to Flora and me to drink tea there because she was\r\nof our age.  She married quite young, something very prosperous and\r\nrather aged, and the glories of dear Matilda\'s villa at Bristol have\r\nbeen our staple subject, but Mr. Pugh died in the spring, leaving his\r\nlady five hundred a year absolutely her own, and she is come to stay\r\nwith her aunt, and look for a house.\'\r\n\r\n\'Et cetera,\' added Tom.\r\n\r\n\'What, in the buxom widow line?\' asked Harry.\r\n\r\n\'No, no!\' said Richard, rather indignantly.\r\n\r\n\'No, in the pathetic line,\' said Ethel; \'but that requires some\r\nself-denial.\'\r\n\r\n\'Our tongues don\'t lose their venom, you see, Harry,\' put in the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\'No indeed, papa,\' said Ethel, really anxious to guard her brothers. \'I\r\nwas very sorry for her at first, and perhaps I pity her more now than\r\neven then.  I was taken with her pale face and dark eyes, and I believe\r\nshe was a good wife, and really concerned for her husband; but I can\'t\r\nhelp seeing that she knows her grief is an attraction.\'\r\n\r\n\'To simple parsons,\' muttered Tom along the tube of his microscope.\r\n\r\n\'The sound of her voice showed her to be full of pretension,\' said\r\nBlanche.  \'Besides, Mrs. Ledwich\'s trumpeting would fix my opinion in a\r\nmoment.\'\r\n\r\n\'Just so,\' observed the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\'No, papa,\' said Ethel, \'I was really pleased and touched in spite of\r\nMrs. Ledwich\'s devotion to her, till I found out a certain manoeuvring\r\nto put herself in the foreground, and not let her sorrow hinder her\r\nfrom any enjoyment or display.\'\r\n\r\n\'She can\'t bear any one to do what she does not.\'\r\n\r\n\'What!  Mary\'s mouth open against her too?\' cried Dr. May.\r\n\r\n\'Well, papa,\' insisted Mary, \'nobody wanted her to insist on taking the\r\nharmonium at Bankside last Sunday, just because Averil had a cold in\r\nher head; and she played so fast, that every one was put out, and then\r\nsaid she would come to the practice that they might understand one\r\nanother.  She is not even in the Bankside district, so it is no\r\nbusiness of hers.\'\r\n\r\n\'There, Richard, her favours are equally distributed,\' said Aubrey,\r\n\'but if she would take that harmonium altogether, one would not\r\nmind--it makes Henry Ward as sulky as a bear to have his sister going\r\nout all the evening, and he visits it on Leonard.  I dare say if she\r\nstayed at home he would not have been such a brute about the rifle.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should not wonder,\' said Dr. May.  \'I sometimes doubt if home is\r\nsweetened to my friend Henry.\'\r\n\r\n\'O, papa!\' cried Mary, bristling up, \'Ave is very hard worked, and she\r\ngives up everything in the world but her church music, and that is her\r\ngreat duty and delight.\'\r\n\r\n\'Miss Ward\'s music must be a sore trial to the Pug,\' said Tom, \'will it\r\nbe at this affair at Abbotstoke?\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s the question,\' said Ethel.  \'It never goes out, yet is to be\r\nmet everywhere, just over-persuaded at the last moment.  Now Flora, you\r\nwill see, will think it absolutely improper to ask her; and she will be\r\ngreatly disappointed not to have the chance of refusing, and then\r\nyielding at the last minute.\'\r\n\r\n\'Flora must have her,\' said Harry.\r\n\r\n\'I trust not,\' said Blanche, shrinking.\r\n\r\n\'Flora will not ask her,\' said Tom, \'but she will be there.\'\r\n\r\n\'And will dance with me,\' said Harry.\r\n\r\n\'No, with Richard,\' said Tom.\r\n\r\n\'What!\' said Richard, looking up at the sound of his name.  All\r\nlaughed, but were ashamed to explain, and were relieved that their\r\nfather rang the bell.\r\n\r\n\'At that unhappy skein still, Mary?\' said Mrs. Ernescliffe, as the good\r\nnights were passing. \'What a horrid state it is in!\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall do it in time,\' said Mary, \'when there is nothing to distract\r\nmy attention.  I only hope I shall not hurt it for you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Chuck it into the fire at once; it is not worth the trouble,\' said\r\nHector.\r\n\r\nEach had a word of advice, but Mary held her purpose, and persevered\r\ntill all had left the room except Richard, who quietly took the crimson\r\ntangle on his wrists, turned and twisted, opened passages for the\r\nwinder, and by the magic of his dexterous hands, had found the clue to\r\nthe maze, so that all was proceeding well, though slowly, when the\r\nstudy door opened, and Harry\'s voice was heard in a last good night to\r\nhis father.  Mary\'s eyes looked wistful, and one misdirection of her\r\nwinder tightened an obdurate loop once more.\r\n\r\n\'Run after Harry,\' said Richard, taking possession of the ivory. \'Good\r\nnight; I can always do these things best alone.  I had rather--yes,\r\nreally--good night:\' and his kiss had the elder brother\'s authority of\r\ndismissal.\r\n\r\nHis Maimouna was too glad and grateful for more than a summary \'Thank\r\nyou,\' and flew up-stairs in time to find Harry turning, baffled, from\r\nher empty room.  \'What, only just done that interminable yarn?\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'Richard is doing it.  I could not help letting him, this first evening\r\nof you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Good old Richard! he is not a bit altered since I first went to sea,\r\nwhen I was so proud of that,\' said Harry, taking up his midshipman\'s\r\ndirk, which formed a trophy on Mary\'s mantelshelf.\r\n\r\n\'Are we altered since you went last?\' said Mary.\r\n\r\n\'The younger ones, of course.  I was in hopes that Aubrey would have\r\nbeen more like old June, but he\'ll never be so much of a fellow.\'\r\n\r\n\'He is a very dear good boy,\' said Mary, warmly.\r\n\r\n\'Of course he is,\' said Harry, \'but, somehow, he will always have a\r\nwoman-bred way about him.  Can\'t be helped, of course; but what a pair\r\nof swells Tom and Blanche are come out!\' and he laughed good-naturedly.\r\n\r\n\'Is not Blanche a beautiful dear darling?\' cried Mary, eagerly.  \'It is\r\nso nice to have her.  They could not come at first because of the\r\ninfection, and then because of the rifle corps, and now it is delicious\r\nto have all at home.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, Molly, I\'m glad it wasn\'t you that have married.  Mind, you\r\nmustn\'t marry till I do.\'\r\n\r\nAnd Harry was really glad that Mary\'s laugh was perfectly \'fancy free,\'\r\nas she answered, \'I\'m sure I hope not, but I won\'t promise, because\r\nthat might be unreasonable, you know.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, you prudent, provident Polly!  But,\' added Harry, recalled to a\r\nsense of time by a clock striking eleven, \'I came to bring you\r\nsomething, Mary.  You shall have it, if you will give me another.\'\r\n\r\nMary recognized, with some difficulty, a Prayer-Book with limp covers\r\nthat Margaret had given him after his first voyage.  Not only was it\r\nworn by seven years\' use, but it was soiled and stained with dark\r\nbrownish red, and a straight round hole perforated it from cover to\r\ncover.\r\n\r\n\'Is it too bad to keep?\' said Harry.  \'Let me just cut out my name in\r\nMargaret\'s hand, and the verse of the 107th Psalm; luckily the ball\r\nmissed that.\'\r\n\r\n\'The ball?\' said Mary, beginning to understand.\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  Every one of those circles that you see cut out there, was in\r\nhere,\' said Harry, laying his hand over his chest, \'before the ball,\r\nwhich I have given to my father.\'\r\n\r\n\'O, Harry!\' was all Mary could say, pointing to her own name in a\r\npencil scrawl on the fly-leaf.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I set that down because I could not speak to tell what was to be\r\ndone with it, when we didn\'t know that that book had really been the\r\nsaving of my life.  That hair\'s-breadth deviation of the bullet made\r\nall the difference.\'\r\n\r\nMary was kissing the blood-stained book, and sobbing.\r\n\r\n\'Why, Mary, what is there to cry for?  It is all over now, I tell you.\r\nI am as well as man would wish, and there\'s no more about it but to\r\nthank God, and try to deserve His goodness.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes, I know, Harry; but to think how little we knew, or thought,\r\nor felt--going on in our own way when you were in such danger and\r\nsuffering!\'\r\n\r\n\'Wasn\'t I very glad you were going on in your own way!\' said Harry.\r\n\'Why, Mary, it was that which did it--it has been always that thought\r\nof you at the Minster every day, that kept me to reading the Psalms,\r\nand so having the book about me.  And did not it do one good to lie and\r\nthink of the snug room, and my father\'s spectacles, and all as usual?\r\nWhen they used to lay me on the deck of the Dexter at night, because I\r\ncould not breathe below, I used to watch old Orion, who was my great\r\nfriend in the Loyalty Isles, and wish the heathen name had not stuck to\r\nthe old fellow, he always seemed so like the Christian warrior,\r\nclimbing up with his shield before him and his.  A home like this is a\r\nshield to a man in more ways than one, Mary.  Hollo, was that the\r\nstreet door?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; Ritchie going home.  Fancy his being at the silk all this time! I\r\nam so sorry!\'\r\n\r\nMaugre her sorrow, there were few happier maidens in England than Mary\r\nMay, even though her service was distracted by the claims of three\r\nslave-owners at once, bound as she was, to Ethel, by habitual fidelity,\r\nto Harry, by eager adoration, to Blanche, by willing submission.\r\nLuckily, their requisitions (for the most part unconscious) seldom\r\nclashed, or, if they did, the two elders gave way, and the bride\r\nasserted her supremacy in the plenitude of her youthful importance and\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nThus she carried off Mary in her barouche to support her in the return\r\nof bridal calls, while the others were organizing a walk to visit Flora\r\nand the rifle target.  Gertrude\'s enthusiasm was not equal to walking\r\nwith a weapon that might be loaded, nor to being ordered out to admire\r\nthe practice, so she accompanied the sisters; Tom was reading hard; and\r\nEthel found herself, Aubrey, and the sailor, the only ones ready to\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nThis was a decided treat, for Aubrey and she were so nearly one, that\r\nit was almost a tete-a-tete with Harry, though it was not his way to\r\nenter by daylight, and without strong impulse, on what regarded\r\nhimself, and there were no such confidences as those to Mary on the\r\nprevious night; but in talking over home details, it was easier to\r\nspeak without Tom\'s ironical ears and caustic tongue.\r\n\r\nAmong other details, the story of the summer that Ethel and Aubrey had\r\nspent at Coombe was narrated, and Aubrey indulged himself by describing\r\nwhat he called Ethel\'s conquest.\r\n\r\n\'It is more a conquest of Norman\'s, and of Melanesia,\' said Ethel. \'If\r\nit were not nonsense to build upon people\'s generous visions at\r\nseventeen, I should sometimes hope a spark had been lit that would\r\nshine some day in your islands, Harry.\'\r\n\r\nGoing up that hill was not the place for Etheldred May to talk of the\r\nfutility of youthful aspirations, but it did not so strike either of\r\nthe brothers, to whom Cocksmoor had long been a familiar fact.  Harry\r\nlaughed to hear the old Ethel so like herself; and Aubrey said, \'By the\r\nbye, what did you do, the day you walked him to Cocksmoor? he was\r\nfuller of those islands than ever after it.\'\r\n\r\n\'I did not mean it,\' said Ethel; \'but the first day of the holidays I\r\ncame on him disconsolate in the street, with nothing to do, and very\r\nsore about Henry\'s refusal to let him volunteer; he walked on with me\r\ntill we found ourselves close to Cocksmoor, and I found he had never\r\nseen the church, and would like to stay for evening service, so I put\r\nhim into the parsonage while I was busy, and told him to take a book.\'\r\n\r\n\'I know,\' said Aubrey; \'the liveliest literature you can get in\r\nRichard\'s parlour are the Missionary Reports.\'\r\n\r\n\'Exactly so; and he got quite saturated with them; and when we walked\r\nhome, I was so thankful that the rifle grievance should be a little\r\ndisplaced, that I led him on to talk and build castles rather more than\r\naccording to my resolutions.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hollo, Ethel!\' said Harry.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I think spontaneous castles are admirable, but I mistrust all\r\ntimber from other people\'s woods.\'\r\n\r\n\'But isn\'t this a horrid shame of Henry?\' said Aubrey.  \'Such a little\r\nprig as he is, to take the place of such a fellow as Leonard, a capital\r\nshot already.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wish Henry had been magnanimous,\' said Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'I\'d as soon talk of a magnanimous weasel, from what I recollect,\' said\r\nHarry.\r\n\r\n\'And he is worse now, Harry,\' continued Aubrey.  \'So spruce and silky\r\nout of doors, and such a regular old tyrannical bachelor indoors.  He\r\nis jealous of Leonard, any one can see, and that\'s the reason he won\'t\r\ngive him his due.\'\r\n\r\n\'You observe,\' said Ethel, \'that this boy thinks the youngest brother\'s\r\ndue is always to come first.\'\r\n\r\n\'So it is, in this family,\' said Harry.  \'No one comes so last as old\r\nRitchie.\'\r\n\r\n\'But of course,\' said Aubrey, rather taken aback, \'if I were not\r\nyoungest, I should have to knock under to some one.\'\r\n\r\nEthel and Harry both laughed heartily; one congratulating him on not\r\nhaving carried the principle into the cockpit, the other adding, \'Don\'t\r\nindoctrinate Leonard with it; there is enough already to breed\r\nbitterness between those brothers!  Leonard ought to be kept in mind\r\nthat Henry has so much to harass him, that his temper should be borne\r\npatiently with.\'\r\n\r\n\'He!\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think papa\'s best endeavours have kept all his father\'s\r\npractice for him, and I am sure their rate of living must make him feel\r\npinched this Christmas.\'\r\n\r\n\'Whew!  He will be in a sweeter humour than ever!\'\r\n\r\n\'I have been trying to show Leonard that there\'s room for magnanimity\r\non his side at least; and don\'t you go and upset it all by common-place\r\nabuse of tutors and governors.\'\r\n\r\n\'I upset it!\' cried Aubrey: \'I might as well try to upset the Minster\r\nas a word from you to Leonard.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nonsense!  What\'s that?\'  For they were hailed from behind, and\r\nlooking round saw two tall figures, weapon in hand, in pursuit.  They\r\nproved to be Hector Ernescliffe and Leonard Ward, each bearing one of\r\nwhat Dr. May called the H. E. rifles; but Leonard looked half shy, half\r\ngrim, and so decidedly growled off all Aubrey\'s attempts at inquiry or\r\ncongratulation, that Ethel hazarded none, and Aubrey looked\r\ndiscomfited, wearing an expression which Harry took to mean that the\r\nweight of his rifle fatigued him, and insisted on carrying it for him,\r\nin, spite of his rather insulted protests and declarations that the\r\nsailor was an invalid; Ethel had walked forwards, and found Leonard at\r\nher side, with a darkening brow as he glanced back at the friendly\r\ncontest.\r\n\r\n\'Harry spoils Aubrey as much as all the others do,\' said Ethel lightly,\r\ndeeming it best to draw out the sting of the rankling thought.\r\n\r\n\'Ay!  None of them would leave him to be pitied and offered favours by\r\nsome chance person,\' said Leonard.\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t call my brother Hector a chance person?\'\r\n\r\n\'Did you say anything to him, Miss May?\' said Leonard, turning on her a\r\nflushed face, as if he could almost have been angered with her.\r\n\r\n\'I said not one word.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nor Aubrey?\'\r\n\r\n\'The volunteer politics were discussed last night, and Henry got abused\r\namong us; but papa defended him, and said it did not rain rifles.\r\nThat\'s all--whatever Hector may have done was without a word to either\r\nof us--very likely on the moment\'s impulse.  Did he go to Bankside\r\nafter you?\'\r\n\r\n\'No.  I was looking in at Shearman\'s window,\' said Leonard, rather\r\nsheepishly, \'at the locks of the new lot he has got in, and he came and\r\nasked if I were going to choose one, for he had got a couple down from\r\nLondon, and the man had stupidly put his cipher on both, so he would be\r\nglad if I would take one off his hands.  I didn\'t accept--I made that\r\nclear--but then he begged, as if it was to oblige him, that I would\r\ncome out to Abbotstoke and help him try the two, for he didn\'t know\r\nwhich he should keep.\'\r\n\r\n\'Very ingenious of him,\' said Ethel laughing.\r\n\r\n\'Now, Miss May, do tell me what I ought to do.  It is such a beauty,\r\nbetter than any Shearman ever dreamt of; just look: at the finish of\r\nthe lock.\'\r\n\r\n\'By the time you have shot with it--\'\r\n\r\n\'Now don\'t, pray,\' said Leonard, \'I haven\'t any one to trust for advice\r\nbut you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed, Leonard, I can see no objection.  It is a great boon to you,\r\nand no loss to Hector, and he is quite enough my father\'s son for you\r\nto look on him as a friend.  I can\'t but be very glad, for the removal\r\nof this vexation ought to make you get on all the better with your\r\nbrother.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ave would be delighted,\' said Leonard; \'but somehow--\'\r\n\r\n\'Somehow\' was silenced by a coalescing of the party at a gate; and\r\nHector and Harry were found deep in an argument in which the\r\nlieutenant\'s Indian reminiscences of the Naval Brigade were at issue\r\nwith the captain\'s Southdown practice, and the experiences of the one\r\nmeeting the technicalities of the other were so diverting, that Leonard\r\nforgot his scruples till at the entrance of the park he turned off\r\ntowards the target with Hector and Aubrey, while the other two walked\r\nup to the house.\r\n\r\nThe Grange atmosphere always had a strange weight of tedium in it, such\r\nas was specially perceptible after the joyous ease of the house in the\r\nHigh Street.  No one was in the drawing-room, and Harry gazed round at\r\nthe stiff, almost petrified, aspect of the correct and tasteful\r\narrangement of the tables and furniture, put his hands in his pockets,\r\nand yawned twice, asking Ethel why she did not go in search of Flora.\r\nEthel shook her head; and in another moment Flora appeared in eager\r\nwelcome; she had been dressing for a drive to Stoneborough to see her\r\nbrother, little expecting him to be in a state for walking to her.\r\nWith her came her little girl, a child whose aspect was always a shock\r\nto those who connected her with the two Margarets whose name she bore.\r\nShe had inherited her father\'s heavy mould of feature and dark\r\ncomplexion, and the black eyes had neither sparkle in themselves nor\r\nrelief from the colour of the sallow cheek; the pouting lips were\r\nfretful, the whole appearance unhealthy, and the dark bullet-shaped\r\nhead seemed too large for the thin bony little figure.  Worn, fagged,\r\nand aged as Flora looked, she had still so much beauty, and far more of\r\nrefinement and elegance, as to be a painful foil and contrast to the\r\nchild that clung to her, waywardly refusing all response to her uncle\'s\r\nadvances.\r\n\r\nFlora made a sign to him to discontinue them, and talked of her\r\nhusband, who was hunting, and heard the history of Harry\'s return and\r\nrecovery.  In the midst, little Margaret took heart of grace, crossed\r\nthe room, and stood by the sailor, and holding up a great India-rubber\r\nball as large as her own head, asked, \'Uncle Harry, were you shot with\r\na cannon-ball as big as this?\'\r\n\r\nThereupon she was on his knee, and as he had all his father\'s\r\nfascination for children, he absolutely beguiled her into ten minutes\r\nof genuine childish mirth, a sight so rare and precious to her mother,\r\nthat she could not keep up her feint of talking to Ethel. The elderly\r\ndame, part nurse, part nursery governess, presently came to take Miss\r\nRivers out, but Miss Rivers, with a whine in her voice, insisted on\r\ngoing nowhere but to see the shooting, and Uncle Harry must come with\r\nher; and come he did, the little bony fingers clasping tight hold of\r\none of his large ones.\r\n\r\n\'Dear Harry!\' said Flora, \'he wins every one!  It is like a cool\r\nrefreshing wind from the sea when he comes in.\'\r\n\r\nIn Flora\'s whole air, voice, and manner, there was apparent a\r\nrelaxation and absence of constraint such as she never allowed herself\r\nexcept when alone with Ethel.  Then only did she relieve the constant\r\nstrain, then only did the veritable woman show herself, and the effort,\r\nthe toil, the weariness, the heart-ache of her life become visible; but\r\nclose together as the sisters lived, such tete-a-tetes were rare, and\r\nperhaps were rather shunned than sought, as perilous and doubtful\r\nindulgences.  Even now, Flora at once fixed a limit by ordering the\r\ncarriage to meet her in a quarter of an hour at the nearest point to\r\nthe rifle-ground, saying she would walk there, and then take home Ethel\r\nand any brother who might be tired.\r\n\r\n\'And see that Margaret does not come to harm,\' said Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'I am not afraid of that,\' said Flora, something in her eye belying\r\nher; \'but she might be troublesome to Harry, and I had rather he did\r\nnot see one of her fights with Miss Morton.\'\r\n\r\n\'How has she been?  I thought her looking clearer and better to-day,\'\r\nsaid Ethel, kindly.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, she is pretty well just now,\' said Flora, allowing herself in one\r\nof her long deep sighs, before descending into the particulars of the\r\nchild\'s anxiously-watched health.  If she had been describing them to\r\nher father, there would have been the same minuteness, but the tone\r\nwould have implied cheerful hope; whereas to Ethel she took no pains to\r\nmask her dejection.  One of the points of anxiety was whether one\r\nshoulder were not outgrowing the other, but it was not easy to discover\r\nwhether the appearance were not merely owing to the child\'s feeble and\r\nungainly carriage.  \'I cannot torment her about that,\' said Flora.\r\n\'There are enough miseries for her already without making more, and as\r\nlong as it does not affect her health, it matters little.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, certainly not,\' said Ethel, who had hardly expected this from\r\nFlora.\r\n\r\nPerhaps her sister guessed her thought, for she said, \'Things are best\r\nas they are, Ethel; I am not fit to have a beautiful admired daughter.\r\nAll the past would too easily come over again, and my poor Margaret\'s\r\ntroubles may be the best balance for her.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Ethel, \'it is bad enough to be an heiress, but a beautiful\r\nheiress is in a worse predicament.\'\r\n\r\n\'Health would improve her looks,\' began the maternal instinct of\r\ndefence, but then breaking off.  \'We met Lord H---- yesterday, and the\r\nuniform is to be like the northern division.  Papa will hear it\r\nofficially to-morrow.\'\r\n\r\n\'The northern has gray, and green facings.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are more up in it than I.  All we begged for was, that it might be\r\ninexpensive, for the sake of the townspeople.\'\r\n\r\n\'I hear of little else,\' said Ethel, laughing; \'Dr. Spencer is as hot\r\non it as all the boys.  Now, I suppose, your party is to come off!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, it ought,\' said Flora, languidly, \'I waited to see how Harry was,\r\nhe is a great element towards making it go off well.  I will talk it\r\nover with Blanche, it will give somebody pleasure if she thinks she\r\nmanages it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Will it give George no pleasure?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know; he calls it a great nuisance, but he would not like not\r\nto come forward, and it is quite right that he should.\'\r\n\r\n\'Quite right,\' said Ethel; \'it is every one\'s duty to try to keep it\r\nup.\'\r\n\r\nWith these words the sisters came within sight of the targets, and\r\nfound Margaret under Harry\'s charge, much interested, and considerably\r\nin the way.  The tidings of the colour of the uniform were highly\r\nappreciated; Aubrey observed that it would choke off the snobs who only\r\nwanted to be like the rifle brigade, and Leonard treated its\r\ninexpensiveness as a personal matter, having apparently cast off his\r\ndoubts, under Hector\'s complimentary tuition.  Indeed, before it grew\r\ntoo dark for taking aim, he and the weapon were so thoroughly united,\r\nthat no further difficulty remained but of getting out his thanks to\r\nMr. Ernescliffe.\r\n\r\nAveril was sitting alone over the fire in the twilight, in a somewhat\r\nforlorn mood, when the door was pushed ajar, and the muzzle of a gun\r\nentered, causing her to start up in alarm, scarcely diminished by the\r\nsight of an exultant visage, though the words were, \'Your money or your\r\nlife.\'\r\n\r\n\'Leonard, don\'t play with it, pray!\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s not loaded.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! but one never can tell:\' then, half ashamed of her terror, \'Pray\r\nput it back, or we shall have an uproar with Henry.\'\r\n\r\n\'This is none of Henry\'s.  He will never own such a beauty as this.\'\r\n\r\n\'Whose is it?  Not yours?  Is it really a rifle!  H. E.?  What\'s that?\'\r\n\r\n\'Hector Ernescliffe!  Didn\'t I tell you he was a princely fellow?\'\r\n\r\n\'Given it to you?  Leonard, dear, I am so happy!  Now I don\'t care for\r\nanything!  What a gallant volunteer you will make!\' and she kissed him\r\nfondly.  We will order the uniform as soon as ever it is settled, and I\r\nhope it will be a very handsome one.\'\r\n\r\n\'It will be a cheap one, which is more to the purpose.  I could get\r\npart myself, only there\'s the tax for Mab, and the subscription to the\r\ncricket club.\'\r\n\r\n\'I would not have you get any of it!  You are my volunteer, and I\'ll\r\nnot give up my right to any one, except that Minna and Ella want to\r\ngive your belt.\'\r\n\r\n\'Where are those children?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'Henry has taken them to Laburnum Grove, where I am afraid they are\r\nbeing crammed with cake and all sorts of nonsense.\'\r\n\r\n\'What could have made him take them there?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! some wish of Mrs. Pugh\'s to see the poor little dears,\' said\r\nAveril, the cloud returning that had been for a moment dispelled.\r\n\r\n\'What\'s the row?\' asked Leonard, kindly.  \'Has he been bothering you?\'\r\n\r\n\'He wants me to sound Mary May about an invitation for Mrs. Pugh to\r\nMrs. Rivers\'s volunteer entertainment.  I am glad I did not say no one\r\nin mourning ought to go, for I must go now you are a volunteer.\'\r\n\r\n\'But you didn\'t consent to mention her?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, indeed!  I knew very well you would say it was a most improper use\r\nto make of the Mays\' kindness, and I can\'t see what business she has\r\nthere!  Then he said, no, she was certain not to go, but the attention\r\nwould be gratifying and proper.\'\r\n\r\n\'That is Mrs. Rivers\'s look-out.\'\r\n\r\n\'So I said, but Henry never will hear reason.  I did not tell you of\r\nour scene yesterday over the accounts; he says that we must contract\r\nour expenses, or he shall be ruined; so I told him I was ready to give\r\nup the hot-house, or the footman, or the other horse, or anything he\r\nwould specify; but he would not hear of it--he says it would be fatal\r\nto alter our style of living, and that it is all my fault for not being\r\neconomical!  O, Leonard, it is very hard to give up all one cared for\r\nto this housekeeping, and then never to please!\'\r\n\r\nLeonard felt his brother a tyrant.  \'Never mind, Ave dear,\' said he,\r\n\'go on doing right, and then you need not care for his\r\nunreasonableness.  You are a dear good girl, and I can\'t think how he\r\ncan have the heart to vex you.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t care while I have you, Leonard,\' she said, clinging to him.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the others were heard returning, and an ironical look\r\npassed between the brother and sister at certain injunctions that were\r\nheard passing about the little India-rubber goloshes; but Henry had\r\nreturned in high good-humour, was pleased to hear of his brother\'s good\r\nfortune, pronounced it very handsome in Mr. Ernescliffe, and even\r\noffered to provide the rest of the equipment; but this was proudly\r\nrejected by Averil, with some of the manifestations of exclusive\r\npartiality that naturally wounded the elder brother.  He then announced\r\nan engagement that he had made with Mrs. Ledwich for a musical evening\r\nthe next week.  Averil had her harmonium at her tongue\'s end, but the\r\nevening was a free one, chosen on purpose to accommodate her; she had\r\nno excuse, and must submit.\r\n\r\n\'And practise some of your best pieces, Ave,\' said Henry.  \'Mrs. Pugh\r\nwas kind enough to offer to come and get up some duets with yon.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am greatly obliged,\' said Averil, dryly, \'but I do not play duets.\'\r\n\r\n\'You would do wisely to accept her kindness, argued Henry.  \'It would\r\nbe a great advantage to you to be intimate with a lady of her\r\nopportunities.\'\r\n\r\n\'I do not like patronage,\' said Averil.\r\n\r\n\'Ave!  Ave!\' cried the children, who had been trying to attract her\r\nattention, \'if you will let us go to Laburnum Grove by twelve o\'clock\r\nto-morrow, Mis. Pugh will show us her book of the pretty devices of\r\nletters, and teach us to make one.\'\r\n\r\n\'You will have not finished lessons by twelve.\'\r\n\r\n\'But if we have?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, certainly not, I can\'t have you bothering every one about that\r\nnonsensical fashion.\'\r\n\r\n\'You shall go, my dears,\' said Henry.  \'I can\'t think why your sister\r\nshould be so ill-natured.\'\r\n\r\nAveril felt that this was the way to destroy her authority, and though\r\nshe kept silence, the tears were in her eyes, and her champion broke\r\nforth, \'How can you be such a brute, Henry?\'\r\n\r\n\'Come away, my dears,\' said Averil, rising, and holding out her hands\r\nto her sisters, as she recollected how bad the scene was for them, but\r\nit was only Minna who obeyed the call, Ella hung about Henry, declaring\r\nthat Leonard was naughty, and Ave was cross.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' shouted Leonard, \'I shan\'t stay to see that child set against\r\nher sister!  I wonder what you mean her to come to, Henry!\'\r\n\r\nIt was no wonder that Minna and Ella squabbled together as to which was\r\ncross, Henry or Averil, and the spirit of party took up its fatal abode\r\nin the house of Bankside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n  Too oft my anxious eye has spied\r\n  That secret grief thou fain wouldst hide--\r\n  The passing pang of humbled pride.--SCOTT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winter was gay, between musical evenings, children\'s parties,\r\nclerical feastings of district visitors, soirees for Sunday-school\r\nteachers, and Christmas-trees for their scholars.  Such a universal\r\nfavourite as Harry, with so keen a relish for amusement, was sure to\r\nfall an easy prey to invitations; but the rest of the family stood\r\namazed to see him accompanied everywhere by Tom, to whom the secular\r\nand the religious dissipations of Stoneborough had always hitherto been\r\nequally distasteful.  Yet be submitted to a Christmas course of music,\r\ncarpet-dances, and jeux de societe on the one hand, and on the other\r\nconferred inestimable obligations on the ecclesiastical staff by\r\nexhibitions of his microscope and of some of the ornamental sports of\r\nchemistry.\r\n\r\n\'The truth is,\' was the explanation privately dropped out to Ethel,\r\n\'that some one really must see that those two don\'t make fools of\r\nthemselves.\'\r\n\r\nEthel stared; then, coming to the perception who \'those two\' meant,\r\nburst out laughing, and said, \'My dear Tom, I beg your pardon, but, on\r\nthe whole, I think that is more likely to befall some one else.\'\r\n\r\nTom held his head loftily, and would not condescend to understand\r\nanything so foolish.\r\n\r\nHe considered Bankside as the most dangerous quarter, for Harry was\r\nenraptured with Miss Ward\'s music, extolled her dark eyes, and openly\r\navowed her attraction; but there were far more subtle perils at\r\nLaburnum Grove.  The fair widow was really pretty, almost elegant, her\r\nweeds becoming; and her disposition so good, so religious, so\r\ncharitable, that, with her activity, intelligence, and curate-worship,\r\nshe was a dangerous snare to such of mankind as were not sensible of\r\nher touch of pretension.  As to womankind, it needed a great deal of\r\nsubmissiveness to endure her at all; and this was not Averil Ward\'s\r\nleading characteristic.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the ubiquity of Mrs. Pugh was a sore trial to that young lady,\r\njust so superior herself as to detect the flimsiness of the widow\'s\r\nattainments.  It was vexatious to find that by means of age,\r\nassumption, and position, these shallow accomplishments made a\r\nprodigious show in the world, while her own were entirely overlooked.\r\nShe thought she despised the admiration of the second-rate world of\r\nStoneborough, but it nettled her to see it thus misplaced; and there\r\nwas something provoking in the species of semi-homage paid in that\r\nquarter by the youths of the May family.\r\n\r\nAs to the sailor, Averil frankly liked him very much; he was the\r\npleasantest young man, of the most open and agreeable manners, who had\r\never fallen in her way.  He was worthy to be Mary\'s brother, for he was\r\nfriendly to Leonard, and to herself had a truthfully flattering way\r\nthat was delightful.  Without any sentiment in the case, she always\r\nfelt disappointed and defrauded if she were prevented from having a\r\nconversation with him; and when this happened, it was generally either\r\nfrom his being seized upon by Mrs. Pugh, or from her being baited by\r\nhis brother Tom.\r\n\r\nAveril was hard to please, for she was as much annoyed by seeing Tom\r\nMay sitting courteous and deferential by the side of Mrs. Pugh, as by\r\nhis attentions to herself.  She knew that he was playing the widow off,\r\nand that, when most smooth and bland in look and tone, he was inwardly\r\nchuckling; and to find the identical politeness transferred to herself,\r\nmade her feel not only affronted but insulted by being placed on the\r\nsame level.  Thus, when, at a \'reunion\' at Laburnum Grove, she had been\r\nlooking on with intense disgust while Tom was admiring Mrs. Pugh\'s\r\nfamous book of devices from letters, translating the mottoes, and\r\npromising contributions, the offence was greatly increased by his\r\ncoming up to her (and that too just as Harry was released by the\r\nbutton-holding Mr. Grey) and saying,\r\n\r\n\'Of course you are a collector too, Miss Ward; I can secure some\r\nduplicates for you.\'\r\n\r\nShe hoard such fooleries?  She have Mrs. Pugh\'s duplicates?  No wonder\r\nshe coldly answered, \'My little sister has been slightly infected,\r\nthank you, but I do not care for such things.\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed!  Well, I always preserve as many as I can, as passports to a\r\nlady\'s favour.\'\r\n\r\n\'That depends on how much sense the lady has,\' said Averil, trusting\r\nthat this was a spirited set down.\r\n\r\n\'You do not consider.  Philosophically treated, they become a perfect\r\nschool in historical heraldry, nay, in languages, in mathematical\r\ndrawing, in illumination, said Tom, looking across to the album in\r\nwhich Mrs. Pugh\'s collection was enshrined, each device appropriately\r\nframed in bright colours.  His gravity was intolerable.  Was this\r\nmockery or not?  However, as answer she must, she said,\r\n\r\n\'A very poor purpose for which to learn such things, and a poor way of\r\nlearning them.\'\r\n\r\n\'True,\' said Tom, \'one pastime is as good as another; and the less it\r\npretends to, the better.  On the whole, it may be a beneficial outlet\r\nfor the revival of illumination.\'\r\n\r\nDid this intolerable person know that there was an \'illuminator\'s\r\nguide\' at home, and a great deal of red, blue, and gold paint, with\r\ngrand designs for the ornamentation of Bankside chapel?  Whether he\r\nknew it or not, she could not help answering, \'Illumination is\r\ndesecrated by being used on such subjects.\'\r\n\r\n\'And is not that better than the subjects being desecrated by\r\nillumination?\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Pugh came to insist on that \'sweet thing of Mendelssohn\'s\' from\r\nher dear Miss Ward; and Averil obeyed, not so glad to escape as\r\ninflamed by vexation at being prevented from fighting it out, and\r\nlearning what he really meant; though she was so far used to the\r\nslippery nature of his arguments as to know that it was highly\r\nimprobable that she should get at anything in earnest.\r\n\r\n\'If his sisters were silly, I should not mind,\' said she to Leonard;\r\n\'then he might hold all women cheap from knowing no better; but when\r\nthey like sensible things, why is every one else to be treated like an\r\nape?\'\r\n\r\n\'Never mind,\' said Leonard, \'he sneers at everybody all alike!  I can\'t\r\nthink how Dr. May came to have such a son, or how Aubrey can run after\r\nhim so.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should like to know whether they really think it irreverent to do\r\nilluminations.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nonsense, Ave; why should you trouble yourself about what he says to\r\ntease you? bad luck to him!\'\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Averil was not at ease till she had asked Mary\'s opinion\r\nof illumination, and Mary had referred to Ethel, and brought back word\r\nthat all depended on the spirit of the work; that it was a dangerous\r\nthing, for mere fashion, to make playthings of texts of Scripture; but\r\nthat no one could tell the blessing there might be in dwelling on them\r\nwith loving decoration, or having them placed where the eye and thought\r\nmight be won by them.  In fact, Ethel always hated fashion, but feared\r\nprejudice.\r\n\r\nThe crown of the whole carnival was to be the Abbotstoke entertainment\r\non the enrolment of the volunteers.  Preparations went on with great\r\nspirit, and the drill sergeant had unremitting work, the target little\r\npeace, and Aubrey and Leonard were justly accused of making fetishes of\r\ntheir rifles.  The town was frantic, no clothes but uniforms could be\r\nhad, and the tradesmen forgot their customers in the excitement of\r\nelecting officers.\r\n\r\nAveril thought it very officious of Mrs. Pugh to collect a romantic\r\nparty of banner-working young ladies before the member\'s wife or the\r\nmayor\'s family had authorized it; and she refused to join, both on the\r\nplea of want of time, and because she heard that Mr. Elvers, a real\r\ndragoon, declared colours to be inappropriate to riflemen.  And so he\r\ndid; but his wife said the point was not martial correctness, but\r\npopular feeling; so Mary gratified the party by bringing her needle,\r\nDr. Spencer took care the blazonry of the arms of the old abbey was\r\ncorrect, and Flora asked the great lady of the county to present the\r\nbanner, and gave the invitation to Mrs. Pugh, who sighed, shook her\r\nhead, dried her eyes, and said something about goodness and spirits;\r\nand Mrs. Rivers professed to understand, and hope Mrs. Pugh would do\r\nexactly as best suited her.\r\n\r\nWas this manoeuvring, or only living in the present?\r\n\r\nMary accompanied Harry for a long day of shopping in London when he\r\nwent to report himself, starting and returning in the clouds of night,\r\nand transacting a prodigious amount of business with intense delight\r\nand no fatigue; and she was considered to have fitted out the mayor\'s\r\ndaughters suitably with his municipal dignity, of which Ethel piqued\r\nherself on being proud.\r\n\r\nThe entertainment was not easy to arrange at such a season, and\r\nBlanche\'s \'experience,\' being of early autumn, was at fault; but Flora\r\nsent for all that could embellish her conservatories, and by one of the\r\ncharities by which she loved to kill two birds with one stone, imported\r\na young lady who gained her livelihood by singing at private concerts,\r\nand with her for a star, supported by the Minster and Cathedral choirs,\r\nhoped to get up sufficient music to occupy people till it should be\r\nlate enough to dance.  She still had some diplomacy to exercise, for\r\nMrs. Ledwich suggested asking dear Ave Ward to sing, her own dearest\r\nMatilda would not object on such an occasion to assist the sweet girl;\r\nand Mrs. Rivers, after her usual prudent fashion, giving neither denial\r\nnor assent, Mrs. Ledwich trotted off, and put Averil into an agony that\r\nraised a needless storm in the Bankside house; Leonard declaring the\r\nrequest an insult, and Henry insisting that Ave ought to have no\r\nscruples in doing anything Mrs. Pugh thought proper to be done.  And\r\nfinally, when Ave rushed with her despair to Mary May, it was to be\r\nrelieved at finding that Mrs. Rivers had never dreamt of exposing her\r\nto such an ordeal.\r\n\r\nThough it was the year 1860, the sun shone on the great day, and there\r\nwere exhilarating tokens of spring, singing birds, opening buds,\r\nsparkling drops, and a general sense of festivity; as the gray and\r\ngreen began to flit about the streets, and while Mr. Mayor repaired to\r\nthe Town Hall to administer the oaths to the corps, his unmartial sons\r\nand his daughters started for the Grange to assist Flora in the\r\nreception of her guests.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Lieutenant\'s wife and daughters, as well as the Ernescliffes,\r\nhad slept there, and Ethel found them all with Flora in the great hall,\r\nwhich looked like a winter garden, interspersed with tables covered\r\nwith plate and glass, where eating and drinking might go on all day\r\nlong.  But Ethel\'s heart sank within her at the sight of Flora\'s\r\nhaggard face and sunken eyes.  \'What is the matter?\' she asked Blanche,\r\nan image of contented beauty.\r\n\r\n\'Matter?  Oh, they have been stupid in marking the ground, and Hector\r\nis gone to see about it.  That\'s all.  He is not at all tired.\'\r\n\r\n\'I never supposed he was,\' said Ethel, \'but what makes Flora look so\r\nill?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, that tiresome child has got another cold, and fretted half the\r\nnight.  It is all their fault for giving way to her; and she has done\r\nnothing but whine this whole morning because she is not well enough to\r\ngo out and see the practice!  I am sure it is no misfortune that she is\r\nnot to come down and be looked at.\'\r\n\r\nEthel crossed over to Flora, and asked whether she should go up and see\r\nlittle Margaret.\r\n\r\n\'I should be so thankful,\' said poor Flora; \'but don\'t excite her. She\r\nis not at all well, and has had very little sleep.\'\r\n\r\nEthel ran up-stairs, and found herself in the midst of a fight between\r\nthe governess and Margaret, who wanted to go to the draughty passage\r\nwindow, which she fancied had a better view than that of her nursery.\r\nLuckily, Aunt Ethel was almost the only person whom Margaret did not\r\nlike to see her naughty; and she subsided into a much less\r\nobjectionable lamentation after Uncle Harry and his anchor buttons.\r\nEthel promised to try whether he could be found, and confident in his\r\ngood-nature, ran down, and boldly captured him as he was setting out to\r\nsee Hector\'s operations.  He came with a ready smile, and the child was\r\nhappy throughout his stay.  Flora presently stole a moment\'s visit,\r\nintending her sister\'s release as well as his; but Ethel, in pity to\r\ngoverness as well as pupil, declared the nursery window to be a prime\r\npost of observation, and begged to be there left.\r\n\r\nMargaret began to believe that they were very snug there, and by the\r\ntime the bugles were heard, had forgotten her troubles in watching the\r\narrivals.\r\n\r\nUp came the gray files, and Ethel\'s heart throbbed and her eye\r\nglistened at their regular tread and military bearing.  Quickly\r\nMargaret made out papa; but he was too real a soldier to evince\r\nconsciousness of being at his own door, before the eyes of his wife and\r\ndaughter; and Aubrey\'s young face was made up in imitation of his\r\nimpassiveness.  Other eyes were less under control, and of these were a\r\nbrown pair that wandered restlessly, till they were raised to the\r\nnursery window, and there found satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe aunt and niece were too immediately above the terrace to see what\r\npassed upon it, nor could they hear the words; so they only beheld the\r\napproach of the Ensign, and after a brief interval, his return with the\r\ntall green silk colours, with the arms of the old abbey embroidered in\r\nthe corner, and heard the enthusiastic cheer that rang out from all the\r\ncorps.\r\n\r\nThen the colours led the way to the ground for practice, for manoeuvres\r\nwere as yet not ready for exhibition.  Almost all the gentlemen\r\nfollowed; and such ladies as did not object to gunpowder or damp grass,\r\nthither betook themselves, guided by the ardent Mrs. Ernescliffe.\r\nHaving disposed of the others in the drawing-rooms and gardens, Flora\r\nand her father came to the nursery, and Ethel was set at liberty to\r\nwitness the prowess of her young champions, being assured by Flora that\r\nshe would be of more use there in keeping the youthful population out\r\nof danger than in entertaining the more timid in the house.\r\n\r\nShe slipped out and hurried down a narrow path towards the scene of\r\naction, presently becoming aware of four figures before her, which her\r\nglass resolved into Harry and Tom, a lady in black, and a child.\r\nEvidently the devoted Tom was keeping guard over one of the\r\nenchantresses, for the figure was that of Averil Ward, though, as Ethel\r\nsaid, shaking hands, she was hardly to be known with only one sister.\r\n\r\n\'We have been delayed,\' said Averil; \'poor little Ella was in an agony\r\nabout the firing, and we could not leave her till your\r\nbrother\'--indicating Harry--\'was so kind as to take her to Gertrude.\'\r\n\r\n\'True to the Englishwoman\'s boast of never having seen the smoke of an\r\nengagement,\' said Tom.\r\n\r\n\'A practising is not an engagement,\' said Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'There may be quite as many casualties,\' quoth Tom, indulging in some\r\nof the current ready-made wit on the dangers of volunteering, for the\r\npure purpose of teasing; but he was vigorously fallen upon by Harry and\r\nEthel, and Averil brightened as she heard him put to the rout. The\r\nshots were already heard, when two more black figures were seen in the\r\ndistance, going towards the gate.\r\n\r\n\'Is that Richard?\' exclaimed Tom.\r\n\r\n\'Ay, and I do believe, the widow!\' rejoined Harry.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, yes,\' said Averil.  \'I heard her talking about Abbotstoke Church,\r\nand saying how much she wished to see it.  She must have got Mr. May to\r\nshow it to her.\'\r\n\r\nEthel, who had no real fears for Richard herself, looked on amused to\r\nwatch how the guardian spirit was going to act.  He exclaimed, \'By the\r\nbye, Miss Ward, would you not like to see it?  They have a very nice\r\nbrass to old Mr. Rivers, and have been doing up the chancel.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, said Ave, \'I should prefer going to see how Leonard is\r\ngetting on.\'\r\n\r\n\'Right, Miss Ward,\' said Harry; \'the church won\'t run away.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, then,\' said Tom, after a moment\'s hesitation, \'I think I shall\r\njust run down, as the church is open, and see what sort of work they\r\nhave made of the chancel.\'\r\n\r\nEthel had the strongest fancy to try what he would do if she were to be\r\nseized with a desire to inspect the chancel; but she did not wish to\r\nlet Harry and Averil appear on the ground under no escort but Minna\'s,\r\nand so permitted Tom to leave them to her keeping, and watched him\r\nhasten to break up the tete-a-tete.\r\n\r\nComing among the spectators, who, chiefly drawn up on the carriage\r\ndrive, were watching from a safe distance the gray figures in turn take\r\naim and emit from their rifles the flash and cotton-wool-like tuft of\r\nsmoke, Ethel\'s interest was somewhat diminished by hearing that all the\r\nother marksmen had been distanced by the head keepers of Abbotstoke and\r\nDrydale, between whom the contest really lay.\r\n\r\n\'The rest is a study of character,\' said Dr. Spencer, taking a turn up\r\nand down the road with her.  \'I have been watching the various pairs of\r\nbrothers; and I doubt if any stand the test as well as the house of\r\nMay.\'\r\n\r\n\'There\'s only one in the field to-day.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, but I\'ve seen them together before now, and I will say for even\r\nTom that he has no black looks when his junior shoots better than he\r\ndoes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, yes!  But then it is Aubrey.\'\r\n\r\nDr. Spencer laughed.  \'Lucky household where that "it is" accounts for\r\nall favours to the youngest, instead of for the countenance falling at\r\nhis successes.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am afraid I know whom you mean.  But he has no generosity in him.\'\r\n\r\n\'And his sister helps to make him jealous.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am afraid she does; but though it is very sad, one can\'t wonder at\r\nher preference of the great to the small.\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor girl, I wonder how she will get on when there is a new inmate in\r\nthe happy family.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ha! you shocking old gossip, what have you found out now?\'\r\n\r\n\'Negotiation for the introduction of a Pug dog from the best\r\ncircles--eh?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, if he were alone in the world, it would be a capital match.\'\r\n\r\n\'So she thinks, I fancy; but L600 a year might do better than purchase\r\nso many incumbrances.  Depend upon it, the late lamented will remain in\r\nthe ascendant till there are no breakers ahead.\'\r\n\r\nIn process of time, ladies, volunteers, and all, were assembled in the\r\ngreat music-room for the concert; and Ethel, having worked hard in the\r\nservice of the company, thought her present duty lay with the sick\r\nchild, and quietly crept away, taking, however, one full view of the\r\nentire scene, partly for her own satisfaction, partly in case Margaret\r\nshould be inclined to question her on what every one was doing.\r\n\r\nThere was the orchestra, whose erection Richard had superintended;\r\nthere was the conductor in his station, and the broad back of the\r\nCathedral organist at the piano, the jolly red visages of the singing\r\nmen in their ranks, the fresh faces of the choristers full of elation,\r\nthe star from London, looking quiet and ladylike, courteously led to\r\nher place by George Rivers himself.  But, for all his civility, how\r\nbored and sullen he looked! and how weary were poor Flora\'s smiles,\r\nthough her manner was so engaging, and her universal attention so\r\nunremitting!  What a contrast to the serene, self-enfolded look of\r\nhappiness and prosperity on the pretty youthful face of Blanche, her\r\nrich delicate silk spreading far beyond the sofa where she sat among\r\nthe great ladies; and her tall yellow-haired husband leaning against\r\nthe wall behind her, in wondering contemplation of his Blanche taking\r\nher place in her own county.\r\n\r\nFarther back, among the more ordinary herd, Ethel perceived Mrs. Pugh,\r\nbridling demurely, with Tom on guard over her on one side, and Henry\r\nWard looking sulky on the other, with his youngest sister in his\r\ncharge.  The other was looking very happy upon Leonard\'s knee, close to\r\nAveril and Mary, who were evidently highly satisfied to have coalesced.\r\nAveril was looking strikingly pretty--the light fell favourably on her\r\nprofuse glossy hair, straight features, and brilliant colouring; her\r\ndark eyes were full of animation, and her lips were apart with a smile\r\nas she listened to Leonard\'s eager narration; and Ethel glanced towards\r\nHarry to see whether he were admiring.  No; Harry was bringing in a\r\nhall arm-chair in the background, for a vary large, heavy,\r\nvulgar-looking old man, who seemed too ponderous and infirm for a place\r\non the benches.  Richard made one of a black mass of clergy, and Aubrey\r\nand Gertrude had asserted their independence by perching themselves on\r\na window-seat, as far as possible from all relations, whence they\r\nnodded a merry saucy greeting to Ethel, and she smiled back again,\r\nthinking her tall boy in his gray tunic and black belt, and her plump\r\ngirl in white with green ribbons, were as goodly a pair as the room\r\ncontained.\r\n\r\nBut where was the Doctor?\r\n\r\nEthel had a shrewd suspicion where she should find him; and in the\r\nnursery he was, playing at spillekens with his left hand.\r\n\r\nIt was not easy to persuade him that the music would be wasted on her,\r\nand that he ought to go down that it might receive justice; but\r\nMargaret settled the question. \'You may go, grandpapa.  Aunt Ethel is\r\nbest to play at spillekens, for she has not got a left hand.\'\r\n\r\n\'There\'s honour for me, who used to have two!\' and therewith Ethel\r\nturned him out in time for the overture.\r\n\r\nMargaret respected her aunt sufficiently not to be extra wayward with\r\nher, and between the spillekens, and a long story about Cousin Dickie\r\nin New Zealand, all went well till bed-time.  There was something in\r\nthe child\'s nervous temperament that made the first hours of the night\r\npeculiarly painful to her, and the sounds of the distant festivity\r\nadded to her excitability.  She fretted and tossed, moaned and wailed,\r\nsat up in bed and cried, snapped off attempts at hymns, would not\r\nlisten to stories, and received Ethel\'s attempts at calm grave commands\r\nwith bursts of crying, and calls for mamma and papa. The music had\r\nceased, tuning of violins was heard, and Ethel dreaded the cries being\r\nheard down-stairs.  She was at her wits\' end, and was thinking who\r\nwould most avail, and could be fetched with least sensation, when there\r\nwas a soft knock at the door, and Harry\'s voice said, \'Hollo, what\'s\r\nthe matter here?\'  In he came with his white glove half on, and\r\nperceiving the state of the case said, \'Can\'t go to sleep?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Uncle Harry, take me;\' and the arms were stretched out, and the\r\ntear-stained face raised up.\r\n\r\n\'We\'ll put you to sleep as sound as if you were in a hammock just off\r\nmiddle watch,\' said Harry; and the next moment he had her rolled up in\r\nher little blue dressing-gown, nestling on his broad shoulder, while he\r\nwalked up and down the room, crooning out a nautical song, not in\r\nfirst-rate style, but the effect was perfect; the struggles and sobs\r\nwere over, and when at the end of a quarter of an hour Harry paused and\r\nlooked at the little thin sharp face, it was softened by peaceful sleep.\r\n\r\nEthel pointed to the door.  There stood Flora, her eyes full of tears.\r\n\r\nHarry laid the little sleeper on her bed, and covered her up.  Flora\r\nlaid her arm on his shoulder and gave him such a kiss as she had not\r\ngiven even when he had come back as from the dead.  Then she signed to\r\nthem to come, but sped away before them, not trusting herself to speak.\r\nEthel tarried with Harry, who was in difficulties with gloves too small\r\nfor his broad hand, and was pshawing at himself at having let Tom get\r\nthem for him at Whitford.\r\n\r\n\'O, Harry,\' said Ethel, \'you are the most really like papa of us all!\r\nHow did you come to think of it!\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'d have given a good deal if any one would have walked quarter-deck\r\nwith me some nights last summer,\' said Harry, still intent on the\r\nglove.  \'What is to be done, Ethel! that rogue Tom always snaps up all\r\nthe beauty.  I dare say he has engaged Miss Ward and the widow both.\'\r\n\r\nIt was no time for sentiment; so Ethel suggested getting half into one\r\nglove, and carrying the other.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll be quite irresistible enough, Harry!  And if all the beauty is\r\nengaged, I\'ll dance with you myself.\'\r\n\r\n\'Will you?\' cried the lieutenant, with sparkling eyes, \'then you are a\r\njolly old Ethel!  Come along, then;\' and he took her on his arm, ran\r\ndown-stairs with her, and before she well knew where she was, or what\r\nwas going on, she found herself in his great grasp passive as a doll,\r\ndragged off into the midst of a vehement polka that took her breath\r\naway.  She trusted to him, and remained in a passive, half-frightened\r\nstate, glad he was so happy; but in the first pause heartily wishing he\r\nwould let her go, instead of which she only heard, \'Well done, old\r\nEthel, you\'ll be a prime dancer yet! you\'re as light as a feather;\' and\r\nbefore she had recovered her breath, off he led her with \'Go it again!\'\r\n\r\nWhen at length, panting and bewildered, she was safely placed on a\r\nseat, with \'You\'ve had enough, have you? mind, I shan\'t let you off\r\nanother time,\' she found that her aberration had excited a good deal of\r\nsensation in her own family.  Blanche and Gertrude could not repress\r\ntheir amusement; and Dr. May, with merry eyes, declared that she was\r\ncoming out in a new light.  She had only time to confide to him the\r\nreason that she had let Harry do what he pleased with her, before two\r\nvolunteers were at her side.\r\n\r\n\'Miss May, I did not think you ever danced!\'\r\n\r\n\'Nor I,\' said Ethel; \'but you see what sailors can do with one.\'\r\n\r\n\'Now, Ethel\' said the other over his shoulder, \'now you have danced\r\nwith Harry, you must have this waltz with me.\'\r\n\r\n\'A dangerous precedent, Ethel,\' said the Doctor, laughing.\r\n\r\n\'I couldn\'t waltz to save my life, Aubrey,\' said Ethel; \'but if you can\r\nbear me through a polka as well as Harry did, you may try the next.\'\r\n\r\n\'And won\'t you--will you--for once dance with me? said his companion\r\nimploringly.\r\n\r\n\'Very well, Leonard, if I can get through a quadrille;\' and therewith\r\nEthel was seized upon by both boys to hear the story of every hit and\r\nmiss, and of each of the difficulties that their unpractised corps had\r\nencountered in getting round the corners between Stoneborough and the\r\nGrange.  Then came Leonard\'s quadrille, which it might be hoped was\r\ngratifying to him; but which he executed with as much solemn deference\r\nas if he had been treading a minuet with a princess, plainly regarding\r\nit as the great event of the day.  In due time, he resigned her to\r\nAubrey; but poor Aubrey had been deluded by the facility with which the\r\nstrong and practised sailor had swept his victim along; and Ethel grew\r\nterrified at the danger of collisions, and released herself and pulled\r\nhim aside by force, just in time to avoid being borne down by the\r\nponderous weight of Miss Boulder and her partner.\r\n\r\n\'You did not come to grief with Harry!\' muttered the discomfited boy.\r\n\r\n\'No more did the lamb damage the eagle; but remember the fate of the\r\njackdaw, Mr. Gray-coat!  I deserve some ice for my exertions, so come\r\ninto the hall and get some, and tell me if you have had better luck\r\nelsewhere.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have had no partner but Minna Ward, and she trips as if one was a\r\ndancing-master.\'\r\n\r\n\'And how has Tom been managing?\'\r\n\r\n\'Stunningly civil!  He began with Ave Ward, in the Lancers, and it was\r\nsuch fun--he chaffed her in his solemn way, about music I believe it\r\nwas, and her harmonium.  I could not quite hear, but I could see she\r\nwas in a tremendous taking, and she won\'t recover it all the evening.\'\r\n\r\n\'What a shame it is of Tom!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! but it is such fun!  And since that he has been parading with Pug.\'\r\n\r\n\'She has not danced!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh no!  She got an audience into Meta\'s little sitting-room--Henry\r\nWard, Harvey Anderson, and some of the curates; they shut the door, and\r\nhad some music on their own hook.\'\r\n\r\n\'Was Richard there!\'\r\n\r\n\'At first; but either he could not bear to see Meta\'s piano profaned,\r\nor he thought it too strong when they got to the sacred line, for he\r\nbolted, and is gone home.\'\r\n\r\n\'There\'s Harry dancing with Fanny Anderson.  He has not got Miss Ward\r\nall this time.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nor will,\' said Aubrey.  \'Tom had put her in such a rage that she did\r\nnot choose to dance with that cousin of hers, Sam Axworthy, so she was\r\nobliged to refuse every one else; and I had to put up with that child!\'\r\n\r\n\'Sam Axworthy!  He does not belong to our corps.  How does he come\r\nhere?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! the old man has some houses in the borough, and an omnium gatherum\r\nlike this was a good time to do the civil thing to him. There he is;\r\npeep into the card-room, and you\'ll see his great porpoise back, the\r\nsame old man that Harry in his benevolence assisted to a chair.  He\r\nshook hands with Leonard, and told him there was a snug desk at the\r\nVintry Mill for him.\'\r\n\r\n\'I dare say!\'\r\n\r\n\'And when Leonard thanked him, and said he hoped to get off to\r\nCambridge, he laughed that horrid fat laugh, and told him learning\r\nwould never put him in good case.  Where shall I find you a place to\r\nsit down?  Pug and her tail have taken up all the room,\' whispered\r\nAubrey, as by the chief of the glittering tables in the hall, he saw\r\nMrs. Pugh, drinking tea, surrounded by her attendant gentlemen, and\r\nwith her aunt and Ella Ward, like satellites, a little way from her.\r\n\r\n\'Here is a coign of vantage,\' said Ethel, seating herself on a step a\r\nlittle way up the staircase.  \'How those people have taken possession\r\nof that child all day!\'\r\n\r\n\'I fancy Leonard is come to reclaim her,\' said Aubrey, \'don\'t you see\r\nhim trying to work through and get at her! and Miss Ward told me she\r\nwas going home early, to put the children to bed.  Ha! what\'s the row?\r\nThere\'s Leonard flaring up in a regular rage!  Only look at his\r\neyes--and Henry just like Gertrude\'s Java sparrow in a taking--\'\r\n\r\n\'It must not be,\' cried Ethel, starting up to attempt she knew not\r\nwhat, as she heard Leonard\'s words, \'Say it was a mistake, Henry! You\r\ncannot be so base as to persist!\'\r\n\r\nThere it became evident that Ethel and Aubrey were seen over the\r\nbalusters; Leonard\'s colour deepened, but his eye did not flinch;\r\nthough Henry quailed and backed, and the widow gave a disconcerted\r\nlaugh; then Leonard pounced on his little sister and carried her off to\r\nthe cloak-room.  \'What treason could it have been?\' muttered Aubrey;\r\n\'we shall get it all from Ward;\' but when Leonard re-appeared it was\r\nwith his sister cloaked and bonneted on his arm, each leading a little\r\none; he took them to the entrance and was seen no more.\r\n\r\nNor was the true history of that explosion ever revealed in the May\r\nfamily, though it had grave consequences at Bankside.\r\n\r\nRumour had long declared at Stoneborough that the member\'s little\r\ndaughter was carefully secluded on account of some deformity, and Mrs.\r\nPugh had been one of many ladies who had hoped to satisfy their\r\ncuriosity on this head upon the present occasion.  She had asked Henry\r\nWard whether it were so, and he had replied with pique that he had no\r\nmeans of judging, he had never been called in at the Grange. By way of\r\nsalve to his feelings, the sympathizing lady had suggested that the\r\npreference for London advice might be from the desire of secrecy, and\r\nimprobable as he knew this to be, his vanity had forbidden him to argue\r\nagainst it.  When no little Miss Rivers appeared, the notion of her\r\naffliction gained ground, and Leonard, whose gray back was\r\nundistinguishable from other gray backs, heard Mrs. Pugh citing his\r\nbrother as an authority for the misfortune which Mr. and Mrs. Rivers so\r\ncarefully concealed as to employ no surgeon from their own\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nFalsehood, slander, cruelty, ingratitude, breach of hospitality, were\r\nthe imputations that fired the hot brain of Leonard, and writhed his\r\nlips, as he started round, confronted the lady, and assured her it was\r\na--a--a gross mistake.  His father had always attended the child, and\r\nshe must have misunderstood his brother.  Then, seeing Henry at a\r\nlittle distance, Leonard summoned him to contradict the allegation; but\r\nat that moment the sudden appearance of the two Mays put the whole\r\nconclave to silence.\r\n\r\nNot aware that Mrs. Pugh had confounded together his intelligence and\r\nher surmise, and made him responsible for both, Henry was shocked and\r\ngrieved at his brother\'s insulting and violent demeanour, and exhausted\r\nhimself in apologies and denunciations; while the kind-hearted lady\r\ninterceded, for the boy, declaring that she doted on his generous\r\nspirit, but not confessing the piece of female embroidery which had\r\nembroiled the matter; probably not even aware of it, though sincerely\r\nand kindly desirous to avert the brother\'s anger.  Her amiability,\r\ntherefore, only strengthened Henry\'s sense of his brothers outrage, and\r\nhis resolve to call him to account.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible that night, for Leonard had gone home with the\r\nsisters, and was in bed long before his brother returned.  But at\r\nbreakfast Henry found the forces drawn up against him, and his first\r\nattempt to remonstrate was retorted by the demand what he could mean by\r\nspreading such an abominable\r\nreport--cruel--unfounded--ungrateful--spiteful--\r\n\r\nAveril indeed divined that it was Mrs. Pugh\'s invention; but Henry was\r\nnot inclined to give up Mrs. Pugh, and continued in the belief that\r\nLeonard\'s fiery imagination had fabricated the sentence, and then most\r\nimproperly charged it on the lady, and on himself.  Had it been as\r\nLeonard stated, said Henry, his conduct was shameful and required an\r\napology, whereupon Leonard burst out in passion at being disbelieved,\r\nand Averil was no less indignant.  The storm raged till the business of\r\nthe day interrupted it; and in Henry\'s absence, Averil and her brother\r\nworked up their wrath again, at the atrocity of the assertion regarding\r\nthe child of their entertainers, the granddaughter of their truest,\r\nkindest friend.\r\n\r\nAveril would have rushed to Mary with the whole story, but for\r\nLeonard\'s solemn asseveration that if ever it came to the ears of any\r\none of the Mays, he should send back his rifle to Mr. Ernescliffe, and\r\nwork his way out to one of the colonies rather than again look any of\r\nthe family in the face.\r\n\r\nHenry divided his opponents next time, asking Leonard, in his sister\'s\r\nabsence, whether he had come to his senses and would apologize?\r\nLeonard hoped Henry had come to his!  On the whole, the dispute had\r\nlost some asperity by the absence of Averil, and though Leonard held\r\nhis ground, and maintained that he had every right to deny the\r\nstatement, and that it was Henry\'s duty to make Mrs. Pugh contradict it\r\neverywhere, yet the two approached nearer together, and there was less\r\nmisunderstanding, fewer personalities.\r\n\r\nBut Averil could not forget or forgive.  She persisted in manifesting\r\nher displeasure, and recurred to the subject till her pertinacity wore\r\nout Leonard himself.\r\n\r\n\'Nonsense, Ave,\' he said at last, \'it was a foolish woman\'s gossip that\r\nHenry ought to have quashed; but that is no reason you should treat\r\nthem like toads.\'\r\n\r\n\'Would you have me sanction vile slander?\'\r\n\r\n\'As if you were sanctioning slander by being decently civil!  Is not it\r\nan intolerable thing that we three should never sit down to a meal in\r\npeace together?\'\r\n\r\n\'O, Leonard, don\'t you think I feel the misery?\'\r\n\r\nPut an end to it then, and don\'t pit those poor children one against\r\nthe other.  Just fancy Minna\'s saying to me, "I love you and sister,\r\nbut Ella loves Mrs. Pugh and Henry."\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, they have set Ella against me.  She always appeals to Henry, and\r\nI can do nothing with her.\'\r\n\r\nLeonard looked out of the window and whistled, then said, as if he had\r\nmade a discovery, \'I\'ll tell you what, Ave, something must be done to\r\nset things to rights between us, and I believe the best thing will be\r\nto call on Mrs. Pugh.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not to apologize!  O, Leonard!\'\r\n\r\n\'Stuff and nonsense!  Only to show we don\'t bear malice.  Henry had\r\nbeen at you to call ever so long before this, had he not?\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t see any reason for intimacy.\'\r\n\r\n\'I declare, Ave, you are too bad!  I only want you just to keep the\r\npeace with your own brother.  You have led him the life of a dog these\r\nthree days, and now when I want you to be a little obliging, you talk\r\nof intimacy!\'\r\n\r\n\'Only because I know how it will be.  If I give that woman an inch, she\r\nwill take an ell.\'\r\n\r\n\'Let her then.  It would be much better than always living at\r\ndaggers-drawn with one\'s brother.\'  Then, after waiting for her to say\r\nsomething, he added, \'If you won\'t go with me, I shall go alone.\'\r\n\r\nAveril rose, subdued but not convinced, reverencing her brother, but\r\nafraid of his concessions.\r\n\r\nHowever, the call turned out well.  Mrs. Pugh had a talent for making\r\nherself agreeable, and probably had liked the boy for his outburst. She\r\nwould not let Mab be excluded, loaded her with admiration, and was\r\nextremely interested in the volunteer practice, so that both the young\r\npeople were subjugated for the time by her pleasant manners, and went\r\naway ashamed of their own rancour against one so friendly and\r\ngood-natured, and considerably relieved of their burden of animosity.\r\n\r\nTheir greeting to their brother was so cordial that he perceived their\r\ngood-will, and was sorry that the dread of an evening of warfare had\r\ninduced him to accept an invitation to dine at the Swan with Sam\r\nAxworthy and a party of his friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n  This night is my departing night,\r\n    For here nae longer must I stay;\r\n  There\'s neither friend nor foe of mine\r\n    But wishes me away.\r\n  What I have done through lack of wit,\r\n    I never, never can recall:\r\n  I hope ye\'re all my friends as yet.\r\n    Good night, and joy be with you all.\r\n                               Armstrong\'s Good Night\r\n\r\n\r\nThe storm had blown over, but heavy flakes of cloud still cumbered the\r\nair, and gusts of wind portended that it might gather again.\r\n\r\nHenry Ward took this opportunity of giving his first dinner party. He\r\nsaid it was a necessary return for the civilities they had received;\r\nand to Averil\'s representation that it transgressed the system of rigid\r\neconomy that so much tormented her, he replied by referring her to Mrs.\r\nPugh for lessons in the combination of style and inexpensiveness.\r\n\r\nAveril had almost refused, but the lady herself proffered her\r\ninstructions, and reluctance was of no avail; nothing but\r\ndemonstrations from which her conscience shrank, could have served to\r\ndefend her from the officious interference so eagerly and thankfully\r\nencouraged by the master of the house.  Vainly did she protest against\r\npretension, and quote the example of the Grange; she found herself\r\ncompelled to sacrifice the children\'s lessons to learn of Mrs. Pugh to\r\nmake the paper flowers that, with bonbons and sweetmeats, were to save\r\nthe expense of good food on the dinner-table, and which she feared\r\nwould be despised by Miss May, nay, perhaps laughed over with \'Mr. Tom!\'\r\n\r\nShe hated the whole concern, even the invitation to Dr. and Miss May,\r\nknowing that it was sent in formal vanity, accepted in pure\r\ngood-nature, would bring them into society they did not like, and\r\nexpose her brother\'s bad taste.  Only one thing could have added to her\r\ndislike, namely--that which all Stoneborough perceived excepting\r\nherself and Leonard--that this dinner was intended as a step in Henry\'s\r\ncourtship, and possibly as an encouragement of Harvey Anderson\'s liking\r\nfor herself.  Averil held her head so high, and was so little popular,\r\nthat no one of less assurance than Mrs. Ledwich herself would have\r\ndared approach her with personal gossip; and even Mrs. Ledwich was\r\nsilent here; so that Averil, too young and innocent to connect second\r\nmarriages with recent widowhood, drew no conclusions from Henry\'s\r\nrestless eagerness that his household should present the most imposing\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nWhile the bill of fare was worrying Averil, Leonard was told by Aubrey,\r\nthat his father had brought home a fossil Tower of Babel, dug up with\r\nsome earth out of a new well, three miles off, with tidings of other\r\nunheard-of treasures, and a walk was projected in quest of them, in\r\nwhich Leonard was invited to join.  He gladly came to the early dinner,\r\nwhere he met reduced numbers--the Ernescliffes being at Maplewood, Tom\r\nat Cambridge, and Harry in the Channel fleet; and as usual, he felt the\r\ndifference between the perfect understanding and friendship in the one\r\nhome, and the dread of dangerous subjects in the other.  The expedition\r\nhad all the charms of the Coombe times; and the geological discoveries\r\nwere so numerous and precious, that the load became sufficient to break\r\ndown the finders, and Ethel engaged a market-woman to bring the baskets\r\nin her cart the next morning.\r\n\r\nThat morning a note from Richard begged Ethel to come early to\r\nCocksmoor to see Granny Hall, who was dying.  Thus left to their own\r\ndevices, Aubrey and Gertrude conscientiously went through some of their\r\nstudies; then proceeded to unpack their treasury of fossils, and\r\nendeavour to sort out Leonard\'s share, as to which doubts arose. Daisy\r\nproposed to carry the specimens at once to Bankside, where she wanted\r\nto see Leonard\'s prime echinus; and Aubrey readily agreed, neither of\r\nthe young heads having learnt the undesirableness of a morning visit in\r\na house preparing for a dinner-party too big for it.\r\n\r\nHowever, Leonard made them extremely welcome.  It was too foggy a day\r\nfor rifle practice, and all the best plate and china were in the\r\nschool-room, his only place of refuge; Ave was fluttering about in\r\nhopes of getting everything done before Mrs. Pugh could take it out of\r\nher hands, and the energies of the household were spent on laying out\r\nthe dining-table.  It was clearly impossible to take Gertrude anywhere\r\nbut into the drawing-room, which was in demi-toilette state, the\r\nlustres released from their veils, the gayer cushions taken out of\r\ntheir hiding-places, and the brown holland covers half off.  This was\r\nthe only tranquil spot, and so poor little Mab thought, forbidden\r\nground though it was.  Even in her own home, the school-room, a strange\r\nman had twice trod upon her toes; so no wonder, when she saw her own\r\nmaster and his friends in the drawing-room, that she ventured in, and\r\nleaping on a velvet cushion she had never seen before, and had never\r\nbeen ordered off, she there curled herself up and went to sleep, unseen\r\nby Leonard, who was in eager controversy upon the specimens, which\r\nGertrude, as she unpacked, set down on floor, chair, or ottoman,\r\nunaware of the offence she was committing.  So, unmolested, the young\r\ngeologists talked, named, and sorted the specimens, till the clock\r\nstriking the half-hour, warned the Mays that they must return; and\r\nLeonard let them out at the window, and crossed the lawn to the side\r\ngate with them to save the distance.\r\n\r\nHe had just returned, and was kneeling on the floor hastily collecting\r\nthe fossils, when the door opened, and Henry Ward, coming home to\r\ninspect the preparations, beheld the drawing-room bestrewn with the\r\nrough stones that he had proscribed, and Mab, not only in the room, but\r\nreposing in the centre of the most magnificent cushion in the house!\r\n\r\nHis first movement of indignation was to seize the dog with no gentle\r\nhand.  She whined loudly; and Leonard, whom he had not seen, shouted\r\nangrily, \'Let her alone;\' then, at another cry from her, finding his\r\nadvance to her rescue impeded by a barricade of the crowded and\r\ndisarranged furniture, he grew mad with passion, and launched the stone\r\nin his hand, a long sharp-pointed belemnite.  It did not strike Henry,\r\nbut a sound proclaimed the mischief, as it fell back from the surface\r\nof the mirror, making a huge star of cracks, unmarked by Leonard, who,\r\npushing sofa and ottoman to the right and left, thundered up to his\r\nbrother, and with uplifted hand demanded what he meant by his cruelty.\r\n\r\n\'Is--is this defiance?\' stammered Henry, pointing to the disordered\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\'Look here, Averil,\' as she appeared at the sounds, \'do you defend this\r\nboy now he has very nearly killed me?\'\r\n\r\n\'Killed you!\' and Leonard laughed angrily; but when Henry held up the\r\nelf-bolt, and he saw its sharp point, he was shocked, and he saw horror\r\nin Averil\'s face.\r\n\r\n\'I see,\' he said gravely.  \'It was a mercy I did not!\' and he paused.\r\n\'I did not know what I was about when you were misusing my dog, Henry.\r\nShake hands; I am sorry for it.\'\r\n\r\nBut Henry had been very much frightened as well as angered, and\r\nthought, perhaps, it was a moment to pursue his advantage.\r\n\r\n\'You treat things lightly,\' he said, not accepting the hand.\r\n\r\n\'See what you have done.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am glad it was not your head,\' said Leonard.  \'What does it cost?\r\nI\'ll pay.\'\r\n\r\n\'More than your keep for a year,\' moaned Henry, as he sighed over the\r\nlong limbs of the starfish-like fracture.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I will give up anything you like, if you will only not be sulky\r\nabout it, Henry.  It was unlucky, and I\'m sorry for it; I can\'t say\r\nmore!\'\r\n\r\n\'But I can,\' said Henry with angry dignity, re-inforced by the sight of\r\nthe seamed reflection of his visage in the shivered glass.  \'I tell\r\nyou, Leonard, there\'s no having you in the house; you defy my\r\nauthority, you insult my friends, you waste and destroy more than you\r\nare worth, and you are absolutely dangerous.  I would as soon have a\r\nwild beast about the place.  If you don\'t get the Randall next week,\r\nand get off to the University, to old Axworthy\'s office you go at once.\'\r\n\r\n\'Very well, I will,\' said Leonard, turning to collect the fossils, as\r\nif he had done with the subject.\r\n\r\n\'Henry, Henry, what are you saying?\' cried the sister.\r\n\r\n\'Not a word, Ave,\' said Leonard.  \'I had rather break stones on the\r\nroad than live where my keep is grudged, and there\'s not spirit enough\r\nto get over a moment\'s fright.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is not any one individual thing,\' began Henry, in a tone of\r\nannoyance, \'but your whole course--\'\r\n\r\nThere he paused, perceiving that Leonard paid no attention to his\r\nwords, continuing quietly to replace the furniture and collect the\r\nfossils, as it no one else were in the room, after which he carried the\r\nbasket up-stairs.\r\n\r\nAveril hurried after him.  \'Leonard! oh, why don\'t you explain?  Why\r\ndon\'t you tell him how the stones came there?\'\r\n\r\nLeonard shook his head sternly.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t you mean to do anything?\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothing.\'\r\n\r\n\'But you wanted another year before trying for the scholarship.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; I have no chance there.\'\r\n\r\n\'He will not do it!  He cannot mean it!\'\r\n\r\n\'I do then.  I will get my own living, and not be a burthen, where my\r\nbrother cannot forgive a broken glass or a moment\'s fright,\' said\r\nLeonard; and she felt that his calm resentment was worse than his\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\n\'He will be cooler, and then--\'\r\n\r\n\'I will have no more said to him.  It is plain that we cannot live\r\ntogether, and there\'s an end of it.  Don\'t cry, or you won\'t be fit to\r\nbe seen.\'\r\n\r\n\'I won\'t come down to dinner.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, you will.  Let us have no more about it.  Some one wants you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Please, ma\'am, the fish is come.\'\r\n\r\n\'Sister, sister, come and see how I have done up the macaroons in green\r\nleaves.\'\r\n\r\n\'Sister, sister, do come and reach me down some calycanthus out of the\r\ngreenhouse!\'\r\n\r\n\'I will,\' said Leonard, descending; and for the rest of the day he was\r\nan efficient assistant in the decorations, and the past adventure was\r\nonly apparent in the shattered glass, and the stern ceremonious\r\ncourtesy of the younger brother towards the elder.\r\n\r\nAveril hurried about, devoid of all her former interest in so doing\r\nthings for herself as to save interference; and when Mrs. Ledwich and\r\nMrs. Pugh walked in, overflowing with suggestions, she let them have\r\ntheir way, and toiled under them with the sensation of being like \'dumb\r\ndriven cattle.\'  If Leonard were to be an exile, what mattered it to\r\nher who ruled, or what appearance things made?\r\n\r\nOnly when she went to her own room to dress, had she a moment to\r\nrealize the catastrophe, its consequences, and the means of averting\r\nthem.  So appalled was she, that she sat with her hair on her shoulders\r\nas if spell-bound, till the first ring at the door aroused her to speed\r\nand consternation, perhaps a little lessened by one of her sisters\r\nrushing in to say that it was Mrs. Ledwich and Mrs. Pugh, and that\r\nHenry was still in the cellar, decanting the wine.\r\n\r\nLong before the hosts were ready, Dr. May and Ethel had likewise\r\narrived, and became cognizant of the fracture of the mirror, for,\r\nthough the nucleus was concealed by a large photograph stuck into the\r\nframe, one long crack extended even to the opposite corner.  The two\r\nladies were not slow to relate all that they knew; and while the aunt\r\ndismayed Ethel by her story, the niece, with much anxiety, asked Dr.\r\nMay how it was that these dear, nice, superior young people should have\r\nsuch unfortunate tempers--was it from any error in management? So\r\nearnest was her manner, so inquiring her look, that Dr. May suspected\r\nthat she was feeling for his opinion on personal grounds, and tried to\r\navert the danger by talking of the excellence of the parents, but he\r\nwas recalled from his eulogium on poor Mrs. Ward.\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes! one felt for them so very much, and they are so religious, so\r\nwell principled, and all that one could wish; but family dissension is\r\nso dreadful.  I am very little used to young men or boys, and I never\r\nknew anything like this.\'\r\n\r\n\'The lads are too nearly of an age,\' said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\'And would such things be likely to happen among any brothers?\'\r\n\r\n\'I should trust not!\' said the Doctor emphatically.\r\n\r\n\'I should so like to know in confidence which you think likely to be\r\nmost to blame.\'\r\n\r\nNever was the Doctor more glad that Averil made her appearance!  He\r\ncarefully avoided getting near Mrs. Pugh for the rest of the evening,\r\nbut he could not help observing that she was less gracious than usual\r\nto the master of the house; while she summoned Leonard to her side to\r\nask about the volunteer proceedings, and formed her immediate court of\r\nHarvey Anderson and Mr. Scudamour.\r\n\r\nThe dinner went on fairly, though heavily.  Averil, in her one great\r\ntrouble, lost the sense of the minor offences that would have\r\ndistressed her pride and her taste had she been able to attend to them,\r\nand forgot the dulness of the scene in her anxiety to seek sympathy and\r\ncounsel in the only quarter where she cared for it.  She went\r\nmechanically through her duties as lady of the house, talking\r\ncommonplace subjects dreamily to Dr. May, and scarcely even giving\r\nherself the trouble to be brief with Mr. Anderson, who was on her other\r\nside at dinner.\r\n\r\nIn the drawing-room, she left the other ladies to their own devices in\r\nher eagerness to secure a few minutes with Ethel May, and disabuse her\r\nof whatever Mrs. Ledwich or Mrs. Pugh might have said.  Ethel had been\r\nmore hopeful before she heard the true version; she had hitherto\r\nallowed much for Mrs. Ledwich\'s embellishments; and she was shocked and\r\ntook shame to her own guiltless head for Gertrude\'s thoughtlessness.\r\n\r\n\'Oh no!\' said Averil, \'there was nothing that any one need have minded,\r\nif Henry had waited for explanation!  And now, will you get Dr. May to\r\nspeak to him?  If he only knew how people would think of his treating\r\nLeonard so, I am sure he would not do it.\'\r\n\r\n\'He cannot!\' said Ethel.  \'Don\'t you know what he thinks of it himself?\r\nHe said to papa last year that your father would as soon have sent\r\nLeonard to the hulks as to the Vintry Mill.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I am so glad some one heard him.  He would care about having that\r\ncast up against him, if he cared for nothing else.\'\r\n\r\n\'It must have been a mere threat.  Leonard surely has only to ask his\r\npardon.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, indeed, not again, Miss May!\' said Averil.  \'Leonard asked once,\r\nand was refused, and cannot ask again.  No, the only difficulty is\r\nwhether he ought not to keep to his word, and go to the mill if he does\r\nnot get the Randall.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did he say he would?\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course he did, when Henry threatened him with it, and talked of the\r\nburden of his maintenance!  He said, "Very well, I will," and he means\r\nit!\'\r\n\r\n\'He will not mean it when the spirit of repentance has had time to\r\nwaken.\'\r\n\r\n\'He will take nothing that is grudged him,\' said Averil.  \'Oh! is it\r\nnot hard that I cannot get at my own money, and send him at once to\r\nCambridge, and never ask Henry for another farthing?\'\r\n\r\n\'Nay, Averil; I think you can do a better part by trying to make them\r\nforgive one another.\'\r\n\r\nAveril had no notion of Leonard\'s again abasing himself, and though she\r\nmight try to bring Henry to reason by reproaches, she would not\r\npersuade.  She wished her guest had been the sympathizing Mary rather\r\nthan Miss May, who was sure to take the part of the elder and the\r\nauthority.  Repentance!  Forgiveness!  If Miss May should work on\r\nLeonard to sue for pardon and toleration, and Mrs. Pugh should\r\nintercede with Henry to take him into favour, she had rather he were at\r\nthe Vintry Mill at once in his dignity, and Henry be left to his\r\ndisgrace.\r\n\r\nEthel thought of Dr. Spencer\'s words on the beach at Coombe, \'Never\r\nthreaten Providence!\'  She longed to repeat them to Leonard, as she\r\nwatched his stern determined face, and the elaborately quiet motions\r\nthat spoke of a fixed resentful purpose; but to her disappointment and\r\nmisgiving, he gave her no opportunity, and for the first time since\r\ntheir sea-side intercourse, held aloof from her.\r\n\r\nNor did she see him again during the week that intervened before the\r\ndecision of the scholarship, though three days of it were holidays.\r\nAubrey, whom she desired to bring him in after the rifle drill,\r\nreported that he pronounced himself sorry to refuse, but too busy to\r\ncome in, and he seemed to be cramming with fiery vehemence for the mere\r\nchance of success.\r\n\r\nThe chance was small.  The only hope lay in the possibility of some\r\nhindrance preventing the return of either Forder or Folliot; and in the\r\nmeantime the Mays anxiously thought over Leonard\'s prospects. His\r\nremaining at home was evidently too great a trial for both brothers,\r\nand without a scholarship he could not go to the University.  The evils\r\nof the alternative offered by his brother were duly weighed by the\r\nDoctor and Ethel with an attempt to be impartial.\r\n\r\nMr. Axworthy, though the mill was the centre of his business, was in\r\nfact a corn merchant of considerable wealth, and with opportunities of\r\nextending his connection much farther.  Had his personal character been\r\notherwise, Dr. May thought a young man could not have a better opening\r\nthan a seat in his office, and the future power of taking shares in his\r\ntrade; there need be no loss of position, and there was great\r\nlikelihood both of prosperity and the means of extensive usefulness.\r\n\r\nEthel sighed at the thought of the higher aspirations that she had\r\nfostered till her own mind was set on them.\r\n\r\n\'Nay,\' said the Doctor, \'depend upon it, the desk is admirable training\r\nfor good soldiers of the Church.  See the fearful evil that befalls\r\ngreat schemes intrusted to people who cannot deal with money matters;\r\nand see, on the other hand, what our merchants and men of business have\r\ndone for the Church, and do not scorn "the receipt of custom."\'\r\n\r\n\'But the man, papa!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, there lies the hitch!  If Leonard fails, I can lay things before\r\nHenry, such as perhaps he may be too young to know, and which must\r\nchange his purpose.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Axworthy\'s career during his youth and early manhood was guessed at\r\nrather than known, but even since his return and occupation of the\r\nVintry Mill, his vicious habits had scandalized the neighbourhood, and\r\nthough the more flagrant of these had been discontinued as he advanced\r\nin age, there was no reason to hope that he had so much \'left off his\r\nsins, as that his sins had left him off.\'  His great-nephew, who lived\r\nwith him and assisted in his business, was a dashing sporting young man\r\nof no good character, known to be often intoxicated, and concerned in\r\nmuch low dissipation, and as dangerous an associate as could be\r\nconceived for a high-spirited lad like Leonard.  Dr. May could not\r\nbelieve that any provocation of temper, any motive of economy, any\r\ndesire to be rid of encumbrances to his courtship, could induce a man\r\nwith so much good in him, as there certainly was in Henry Ward, to\r\nexpose his orphan brother to such temptations; and he only reserved his\r\nremonstrance in the trust that it would not be needed, and the desire\r\nto offer some better alternative of present relief.\r\n\r\nOne of the examiners was Norman\'s old school and college friend,\r\nCharles Cheviot, now a clergyman and an under-master at one of the\r\ngreat schools recently opened for the middle classes, where he was\r\nmeeting with great success, and was considered a capital judge of boys\'\r\ncharacters.  He was the guest of the Mays during the examination; and\r\nthough his shy formal manner, and convulsive efforts at young lady\r\ntalk, greatly affronted Gertrude, the brothers liked him.\r\n\r\nHe was in consternation at the decline of Stoneborough school since Mr.\r\nWilmot had ceased to be an under-master; the whole tone of the school\r\nhad degenerated, and it was no wonder that the Government inquiries\r\nwere ominously directed in that quarter.  Scholarship was at a low ebb,\r\nDr. Hoxton seemed to have lost what power of teaching he had ever\r\npossessed, and as Dr. May observed, the poor old school was going to\r\nthe dogs.  But even in the present state of things, Leonard had no\r\nchance of excelling his competitors.  His study, like theirs, had been\r\nmere task-work, and though he showed more native power than the rest,\r\nyet perhaps this had made the mere learning by rote even more difficult\r\nto an active mind full of inquiry.  He was a whole year younger than\r\nany other who touched the foremost ranks, two years younger than\r\nseveral; and though he now and then showed a feverish spark of genius,\r\nreminding Mr. Cheviot of Norman in his famous examination, it was not\r\nsustained--there were will and force, but not scholarship--and besides,\r\nthere was a wide blurred spot in his memory, as though all the\r\nbrain-work of the quarter before his illness had been confused, and had\r\nnot yet become clear.  There was every likelihood that a few years\r\nwould make him superior to the chosen Randall scholar, but at present\r\nhis utmost efforts did not even place him among the seven whose names\r\nappeared honourably in the newspaper.  It was a failure; but Mr.\r\nCheviot had become much interested in the boy for his own sake, as well\r\nas from what he heard from the Mays, and he strongly advised that\r\nLeonard should at Easter obtain employment for a couple of years at the\r\nschool in which he himself was concerned.  He would thus be maintaining\r\nhimself, and pursuing his own studies under good direction, so as to\r\nhave every probability of success in getting an open scholarship at one\r\nof the Universities.\r\n\r\nNothing could be better, and there was a perfect jubilee among the Mays\r\nat the proposal.  Aubrey was despatched as soon as breakfast was over\r\nto bring Leonard to talk it over, and Dr. May undertook to propound it\r\nto Henry on meeting him at the hospital; but Aubrey came back looking\r\nvery blank--Leonard had started of his own accord that morning to\r\nannounce to his uncle his acceptance of a clerk\'s desk at the Vintry\r\nMill!\r\n\r\nAveril followed upon Aubrey\'s footsteps, and arrived while the\r\nschoolroom was ringing with notes of vexation and consternation.  She\r\nwas all upon the defensive.  She said that not a word had passed on the\r\nsubject since the dinner-party, and there had not been a shadow of a\r\ndispute between the brothers; in fact, she evidently was delighted with\r\nLeonard\'s dignified position and strength of determination, and thought\r\nthis expedition to the Vintry Mill a signal victory.\r\n\r\nWhen she heard what the Mays had to propose, she was enchanted, she had\r\nno doubt of Henry\'s willing consent, and felt that Leonard\'s triumph\r\nand independence were secured without the sacrifice of prospects, which\r\nshe had begun to regard as a considerable price for his dignity.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. May was not so successful with Henry Ward.  He did not want to\r\ndisoblige his uncle, who had taken a fancy to Leonard, and might do\r\nmuch for the family; he thought his father would have changed his views\r\nof the uncle and nephew had he known them better, he would not accept\r\nthe opinion of a stranger against people of his own family, and he had\r\nalways understood the position of an usher to be most wretched, nor\r\nwould he perceive the vast difference between the staff of the middle\r\nschool and of the private commercial academy.  He evidently was pleased\r\nto stand upon his rights, to disappoint Dr. May, and perhaps to gratify\r\nhis jealousy by denying his brother a superior education.\r\n\r\nYet in spite of this ebullition, which had greatly exasperated Dr. May,\r\nthere was every probability that Henry\'s consent might be wrung out or\r\ndispensed with, and plans of attack were being arranged at the\r\ntea-table, when a new obstacle in the shape of a note from Leonard\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\'My Dear Aubrey,\r\n\r\n\'I am very much obliged to Dr. May and Mr. Cheviot for their kind\r\nintentions; but I have quite settled with Mr. Axworthy, and I enter on\r\nmy new duties next week.  I am sorry to leave our corps, but it is too\r\nfar off, and I must enter the Whitford one.\r\n\r\n                                      \'Yours,\r\n                                          \'L. A. Ward.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\'The boy is mad with pride and temper,\' said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\'And his sister has made him so,\' added Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'Shall I run down to Bankside and tell him it is all bosh?\' said\r\nAubrey, jumping up.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think that is quite possible under Henry\'s very nose,\' said\r\nEthel.  \'Perhaps they will all be tamer by to-morrow, now they have\r\nblown their trumpets; but I am very much vexed.\'\r\n\r\n\'And really,\' added Mr. Cheviot, \'if he is so wrong-headed, I begin to\r\ndoubt if I could recommend him.\'\r\n\r\n\'You do not know how he has been galled and irritated,\' said the\r\ngeneral voice.\r\n\r\n\'I wonder what Mrs. Pugh thinks of it,\' presently observed the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\'Ah!\' said Ethel, \'Mrs. Pugh is reading "John of Anjou".\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed!\' said the Doctor; \'I suspected the wind was getting into that\r\nquarter.  Master Henry does not know his own interest: she was sure to\r\ntake part with a handsome lad.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why have you never got Mrs. Pugh to speak for him?\' said Mary.  \'I am\r\nsure she would.\'\r\n\r\n\'O, Mary! simple Mary, you to be Ave\'s friend, and not know that her\r\ninterposition is the only thing wanting to complete the frenzy of the\r\nother two!\'\r\n\r\nEthel said little more that evening, she was too much grieved and too\r\nanxious.  She was extremely disappointed in Leonard, and almost\r\nhopeless as to his future.  She saw but one chance of preventing his\r\nseeking this place of temptation, and that was in the exertion of her\r\npersonal influence.  His avoidance of her showed that he dreaded it,\r\nbut one attempt must be made.  All night was spent in broken dreams of\r\njust failing to meet him, or of being unable to utter what was on her\r\ntongue; and in her waking moments she almost reproached herself for the\r\ndiscovery how near her heart he was, and how much pleasure his devotion\r\nhad given her.\r\n\r\nNothing but resolution on her own part could bring about a meeting, and\r\nshe was resolute.  She stormed the castle in person, and told Averil\r\nshe must speak to Leonard.  Ave was on her side now, and answered with\r\ntears in her eyes that she should be most grateful to have Leonard\r\npersuaded out of this dreadful plan, and put in the way of excelling as\r\nhe ought to do; she never thought it would come to this.\r\n\r\n\'No,\' thought Ethel; \'people blow sparks without thinking they may burn\r\na house down.\'\r\n\r\nAve conducted her to the summer-house, where Leonard was packing up his\r\nfossils.  He met them with a face resolutely bent on brightness. \'I am\r\nto take all my household gods,\' he said, as he shook hands with Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'I see,\' said Ethel, gravely; and as Averil was already falling out of\r\nhearing, she added, \'I thought you were entirely breaking with your old\r\nlife.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, indeed,\' said Leonard, turning to walk with her in the paths; \'I\r\nam leaving the place where it is most impossible to live in.\'\r\n\r\n\'This has been a place of great, over-great trial, I know,\' said Ethel,\r\n\'but I do not ask you to stay in it.\'\r\n\r\n\'My word is my word,\' said Leonard, snapping little boughs off the\r\nlaurels as he walked.\r\n\r\n\'A hasty word ought not to be kept.\'\r\n\r\nHis face looked rigid, and he answered not.\r\n\r\n\'Leonard,\' she said, \'I have been very unhappy about you, for I see you\r\ndoing wilfully wrong, and entering a place of temptation in a dangerous\r\nspirit.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have given my word,\' repeated Leonard.\r\n\r\n\'O, Leonard, it is pride that is speaking, not the love of truth and\r\nconstancy.\'\r\n\r\n\'I never defend myself,\' said Leonard.\r\n\r\nEthel felt deeply the obduracy and pride of these answers; her eyes\r\nfilled with tears, and her hopes failed.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Leonard saw the pain he was giving, for he softened, and said,\r\n\'Miss May, I have thought it over, and I cannot go back.  I know I was\r\ncarried away by passion at the first moment, and I was willing to make\r\namends.  I was rejected, as you know.  Was it fit that we should go on\r\nliving together?\'\r\n\r\n\'I do not ask you to live together.\'\r\n\r\n\'When he reproached me with the cost of my maintenance, and threatened\r\nme with the mill if I lost the scholarship, which he knew I could not\r\nget, I said I would abide by those words.  I do abide by them.\'\r\n\r\n\'There is no reason that you should.  Why should you give up all your\r\nbest and highest hopes, because you cannot forgive your brother?\'\r\n\r\n\'Miss May, if I lived with you and the Doctor, I could have such aims.\r\nHenry has taken care to make them sacrilege for me.  I shall never be\r\nfit now, and there\'s an end of it.\'\r\n\r\n\'You might--\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no, no!  A school, indeed!  I should be dismissed for licking the\r\nboys before a week was out!  Besides, I want the readiest way to get on\r\nin the world; I must take care of my sisters; I don\'t trust one moment\r\nto Henry\'s affection for any of them.  This is no home for me, and it\r\nsoon may be no home for them!\' and the boy\'s eyes were full of tears,\r\nthough his voice struggled for firmness and indifference.\r\n\r\n\'I am very sorry for you, Leonard,\' said Ethel, much more\r\naffectionately, as she felt herself nearer her friend of Coombe. \'I am\r\nglad you have some better motives, but I do not see how you will be\r\nmore able to help them in this way.\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall be near them,\' said Leonard; \'I can watch over them.  And\r\nif--if--it is true what they say about Henry and Mrs. Pugh--then they\r\ncould have a cottage near the mill, and I could live with them. Don\'t\r\nyou see, Miss May?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; but I question whether, on further acquaintance, you will wish\r\nfor your sisters to be with their relations there.  The other course\r\nwould put you in the way of a better atmosphere for them.\'\r\n\r\n\'But not for six years,\' said Leonard.  \'No, Miss May; to show you it\r\nis not what you think in me, I will tell you that I had resolved the\r\nlast thing to ask Henry\'s pardon for my share in this unhappy\r\nhalf-year; but this is the only resource for me or my sisters, and my\r\nmind is made up.\'\r\n\r\n\'O, Leonard, are you not deceiving yourself?  Are the grapes ever so\r\nsour, or the nightshade below so sweet, as when the fox has leapt too\r\nshort, and is too proud to climb?\'\r\n\r\n\'Nightshade!  Why, pray?\'\r\n\r\n\'My father would tell you; I know he thinks your cousin no safe\r\ncompanion.\'\r\n\r\n\'I know that already, but I can keep out of his way.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then this is the end of it,\' said Ethel, feeling only half justified\r\nin going so far, \'the end of all we thought and talked of at Coombe!\'\r\n\r\nThere was a struggle in the boy\'s face, and she did not know whether\r\nshe had touched or angered him.  \'I can\'t help it,\' he said, as if he\r\nwould have recalled his former hardness; but then softening, \'No, Miss\r\nMay, why should it be?  A man can do his duty in any state of life.\'\r\n\r\n\'In any state of life where God has placed him; but how when it is his\r\nown self-will?\'\r\n\r\n\'There are times when one must judge for one\'s self.\'\r\n\r\n\'Very well, then, I have done, Leonard.  If you can conscientiously\r\nfeel that you are acting for the best, and not to gratify your pride,\r\nthen I can only say I hope you will be helped through the course you\r\nhave chosen.  Good-bye.\'\r\n\r\n\'But--Miss May--though I cannot take your advice--\' he hesitated, \'this\r\nis not giving me up?\'\r\n\r\n\'Never, while you let me esteem you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you,\' he said, brightening, \'that is something to keep my head\r\nabove water, even if this place were all you think it.\'\r\n\r\n\'My father thinks,\' said Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'I am engaged now; I cannot go back,\' said Leonard.  \'Thank you. Miss\r\nMay.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you for listening patiently,\' said Ethel.  \'Good-bye.\'\r\n\r\n\'And--and,\' he added earnestly, following her back to the house, \'you\r\ndo not think the Coombe days cancelled?\'\r\n\r\n\'If you mean my hopes of you,\' said Ethel, with a swelling heart, \'as\r\nlong as you do your duty--for--for the highest reason, they will only\r\ntake another course, and I will try to think it the right one.\'\r\n\r\nEthel had mentally made this interview the test of her regard for\r\nLeonard.  She had failed, and so had her test; her influence had not\r\nsucceeded, but it had not snapped; the boy, in all his wilfulness, had\r\nbeen too much for her, and she could no longer condemn and throw him\r\noff!\r\n\r\nOh! why will not the rights and wrongs of this world be more clearly\r\ndivided!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n  The stream was deeper than I thought\r\n    When first I ventured here,\r\n  I stood upon its sloping edge\r\n    Without a rising fear.--H. BONAR\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a comfort to find that the brothers parted on good terms.  The\r\nelder was beholden to the younger for the acquiescence that removed the\r\nodium of tyranny from the expulsion, and when the one great disturbance\r\nhad silenced the ephemeral dissensions that had kept both minds in a\r\nconstant state of irritation, Henry wanted, by kindness and\r\nconsideration, to prove to himself and the world that Leonard\'s real\r\ninterests were his sole object; and Leonard rejoiced in being at peace,\r\nso long as his pride and resolution were not sacrificed.  He went off\r\nas though his employment had been the unanimous choice of the family,\r\ncarrying with him his dog, his rifle, his fishing-rod, his fossils, and\r\nall his other possessions, but with the understanding that his Sundays\r\nwere to be passed at home, by way of safeguard to his religion and\r\nmorals, bespeaking the care and consideration of his senior, as Henry\r\nassured himself and Mrs. Pugh, and tried to persuade his sister and Dr.\r\nMay.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. May was more implacable than all the rest.  He called Henry\'s\r\naction the deed of Joseph\'s brethren, and viewed the matter as the\r\nresponsible head of a family; he had a more vivid contemporaneous\r\nknowledge of the Axworthy antecedents, and he had been a witness to\r\nHenry\'s original indignant repudiation of such a destiny for his\r\nbrother.  He was in the mood of a man whose charity had endured long,\r\nand refused to condemn, but whose condemnation, when forced from him,\r\nwas therefore doubly strong.  The displeasure of a loving charitable\r\nman is indeed a grave misfortune.\r\n\r\nNever had he known a more selfish and unprincipled measure,\r\ndeliberately flying in the face of his parents\' known wishes before\r\nthey had been a year in their graves, exposing his brother to ruinous\r\ntemptation with his eyes open.  The lad was destroyed body and soul, as\r\nmuch as if he had been set down in Satan\'s own clutches; and if they\r\ndid not mind what they were about, he would drag Aubrey after him!  As\r\nsure as his name was Dick May, he would sooner have cut his hand off\r\nthan have sent the boys to Coombe together, could he have guessed that\r\nthis was to be the result.\r\n\r\nSuch discourses did not tend to make Ethel comfortable.  If she had\r\nbeen silly enough to indulge in a dream of her influence availing to\r\nstrengthen Leonard against temptation, she must still have refrained\r\nfrom exerting it through her wonted medium, since it was her father\'s\r\nexpress desire that Aubrey, for his own sake, should be detached from\r\nhis friend as much as possible.\r\n\r\nAubrey was the greatest present difficulty.  Long before their illness\r\nthe boys had been the resource of each other\'s leisure, and Coombe had\r\nmade their intimacy a friendship of the warmest nature. Aubrey was at\r\nan age peculiarly dependent on equal companionship, and in the absence\r\nof his brothers, the loss of his daily intercourse with Leonard took\r\naway all the zest of life.  Even the volunteer practice lost its charm\r\nwithout the rival with whom he chiefly contended, yet whose success\r\nagainst others was hotter to him than his own; his other occupations\r\nall wanted partnership, and for the first time in his life he showed\r\nweariness and contempt of his sisters\' society and pursuits.  He rushed\r\noff on Sunday evenings for a walk with Leonard; and though Dr. May did\r\nnot interfere, the daughters saw that the abstinence was an effort of\r\nprudence, and were proportionately disturbed when one day at dinner, in\r\nhis father\'s absence, Aubrey, who had been overlooking his\r\nfishing-flies with some reviving interest, refused all his sisters\'\r\nproposals for the afternoon, and when they represented that it was not\r\na good fishing-day, owned that it was not, but that he was going over\r\nto consult Leonard Ward about some gray hackles.\r\n\r\n\'But you mustn\'t, Aubrey,\' cried Gertrude, aghast.\r\n\r\nAubrey made her a low mocking bow.\r\n\r\n\'I am sure papa would be very much vexed,\' added she, conclusively.\r\n\r\n\'I believe it was luckless Hal that the mill-wheel tore in your nursery\r\nrhymes, eh, Daisy,\' said Aubrey.\r\n\r\n\'Nursery rhymes, indeed!\' returned the offended young lady; \'you know\r\nit is a very wicked place, and papa would be very angry at your going\r\nthere.\'  She looked at Ethel, extremely shocked at her not having\r\ninterfered, and disregarding all signs to keep silence.\r\n\r\n\'Axworthy--worthy of the axe,\' said Aubrey, well pleased to retort a\r\nlittle teasing by the way; \'young Axworthy baiting the trap, and old\r\nAxworthy sitting up in his den to grind the unwary limb from limb!\'\r\n\r\n\'Ethel, why don\'t you tell him not?\' exclaimed Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\'Because he knows papa\'s wishes as well as I do,\' said Ethel; \'and it\r\nis to them that he must attend, not to you or me.\'\r\n\r\nAubrey muttered something about his father having said nothing to him;\r\nand Ethel succeeded in preventing Daisy from resenting this answer.\r\nShe herself hoped to catch him in private, but he easily contrived to\r\nbaffle this attempt, and was soon marching out of Stoneborough in a\r\nstate of rampant independence, manhood, and resolute friendship, which\r\nnevertheless chose the way where he was least likely to encounter a\r\nlittle brown brougham.\r\n\r\nOtherwise he might have reckoned three and a half miles of ploughed\r\nfield, soppy lane, and water meadow, as more than equivalent to five\r\nmiles of good turnpike road.\r\n\r\nBe that as it might, he was extremely glad when, after forcing his way\r\nthrough a sticky clayey path through a hazel copse, his eye fell on a\r\nwide reach of meadow land, the railroad making a hard line across it at\r\none end, and in the midst, about half a mile off, the river meandering\r\nlike a blue ribbon lying loosely across the green flat, the handsome\r\nbuildings of the Vintry Mill lying in its embrace.\r\n\r\nAubrey knew the outward aspect of the place, for the foreman at the\r\nmill was a frequent patient of his father\'s, and he had often waited in\r\nthe old gig at the cottage door at no great distance; but he looked\r\nwith more critical eyes at the home of his friend.\r\n\r\nIt was a place with much capacity, built, like the Grange, by the monks\r\nof the convent, which had been the germ of the cathedral, and showing\r\nthe grand old monastic style in the solidity of its stone barns and\r\nstorehouses, all arranged around a court, whereof the dwelling-house\r\noccupied one side, the lawn behind it with fine old trees, and sloping\r\ndown to the water, which was full of bright ripples after its agitation\r\naround the great mill-wheel.  The house was of more recent date, having\r\nbeen built by a wealthy yeoman of Queen Anne\'s time, and had long\r\nranges of square-headed sash windows, surmounted by a pediment, carved\r\nwith emblems of Ceres and Bacchus, and a very tall front door, also\r\nwith a pediment, and with stone stops leading up to it.  Of the same\r\nera appeared to be the great gateway, and the turret above it,\r\ncontaining a clock, the hands of which pointed to 3.40.\r\n\r\nAubrey had rather it had been four, at which time the office closed. He\r\nlooked round the court, which seemed very dean and rather\r\nempty--stables, barns, buildings, and dwelling-house not showing much\r\nsign of life, excepting the ceaseless hum and clack of the mill, and\r\nthe dash of the water which propelled it.  The windows nearest to him\r\nwere so large and low, that he could look in and see that the first two\r\nor three belonged to living rooms, and the next two showed him business\r\nfittings, and a back that he took to be Leonard\'s; but he paused in\r\ndoubt how to present himself, and whether this were a welcome moment,\r\nand he was very glad to see in a doorway of the upper story of the mill\r\nbuildings, the honest floury face of his father\'s old patient--the\r\nforeman.\r\n\r\nGreeting him in the open cordial way common to all Dr. May\'s children,\r\nAubrey was at once recognized, and the old man came down a step-ladder\r\nin the interior to welcome him, and answer his question where he should\r\nfind Mr. Ward.\r\n\r\n\'He is in the office, sir, there, to the left hand as you go in at the\r\nfront door, but--\' and he looked up at the clock, \'maybe, you would not\r\nmind waiting a bit till it strikes four.  I don\'t know whether master\r\nmight be best pleased at young gentlemen coming to see him in office\r\nhours.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you,\' said Aubrey.  \'I did not mean to be too soon, Hardy, but I\r\ndid not know how long the walk would be.\'\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would have been more true had he said that he had wanted to\r\nelude his sisters, but he was glad to accept a seat on a bundle of\r\nsacks tremulous with the motion of the mill, and to enter into a\r\nconversation with the old foreman, one of those good old peasants whose\r\nintegrity and skill render them privileged persons, worth their weight\r\nin gold long after their bodily strength has given way.\r\n\r\n\'Well, Hardy, do you mean to make a thorough good miller of Mr. Ward?\'\r\n\r\n\'Bless you, Master May, he\'ll never stay here long enough.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why not?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, nor his friends didn\'t ought to let him stay!\' added Hardy.\r\n\r\n\'Why?\' said Aubrey.  \'Do you think so badly of your own trade, Hardy?\'\r\n\r\nBut he could not get an answer from the oracle on this head.  Hardy\r\ncontinued, \'He\'s a nice young gentleman, but he\'ll never put up with\r\nit.\'\r\n\r\n\'Put up with what?\' asked Aubrey, anxiously; but at that instant a\r\ncarter appeared at the door with a question for Master Hardy, and\r\nAubrey was left to his own devices, and the hum and clatter of the\r\nmill, till the clock had struck four; and beginning to think that Hardy\r\nhad forgotten him, he was about to set out and reconnoitre, when to his\r\ngreat joy Leonard himself came hurrying up, and heartily shook him by\r\nthe hand.\r\n\r\n\'Hardy told me you were here,\' he said.  \'Well done, old fellow, I\r\ndidn\'t think they would have let you come and see me.\'\r\n\r\n\'The girls did make a great row about it,\' said Aubrey, triumphantly,\r\n\'but I was not going to stand any nonsense.\'\r\n\r\nLeonard looked a little doubtful; then said, \'Well, will you see the\r\nplace, or come and sit in my room?  There is the parlour, but we shall\r\nnot be so quiet there.\'\r\n\r\nAubrey decided for Leonard\'s room, and was taken through the front door\r\ninto a vestibule paved with white stone, with black lozenges at the\r\nintersections.  \'There,\' said Leonard, \'the office is here, you see,\r\nand my uncle\'s rooms beyond, all on the ground floor, he is too infirm\r\nto go up-stairs.  This way is the dining-room, and Sam has got a\r\nsitting-room beyond, then there are the servants\' rooms.  It is a great\r\nplace, and horridly empty.\'\r\n\r\nAubrey thought so, as his footsteps echoed up the handsome but ill-kept\r\nstone staircase, with its fanciful balusters half choked with dust, and\r\nfollowed Leonard along a corridor, with deep windows overlooking the\r\ngarden and river, and great panelled doors opposite, neither looking as\r\nif they were often either cleaned or opened, and the passage smelling\r\nvery fusty.\r\n\r\n\'Pah!\' said Aubrey; \'it puts me in mind of the wings of houses in books\r\nthat get shut up because somebody has been murdered!  Are you sure it\r\nis not haunted, Leonard?\'\r\n\r\n\'Only by the rats,\' he answered, laughing; \'they make such an\r\nintolerable row, that poor little Mab is frightened out of her wits,\r\nand I don\'t know whether they would not eat her up if she did not creep\r\nup close to me.  I\'m tired of going at them with the poker, and would\r\npoison every man Jack of them if it were not for the fear of her\r\ngetting the dose by mistake.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is that what Hardy says you will never put up with?\' asked Aubrey; but\r\ninstead of answering, Leonard turned to one of the great windows,\r\nsaying,\r\n\r\n\'There now, would not this be a charming place if it were properly\r\nkept?\' and Aubrey looked out at the great cedar, spreading out its\r\nstraight limbs and flakes of dark foliage over the sloping lawn, one\r\nbranch so near the window as to invite adventurous exits, and a little\r\nboat lying moored in the dancing water below.\r\n\r\n\'Perfect!\' said Aubrey.  \'What fish there must lie in the mill tail!\'\r\n\r\n\'Ay, I mean to have a try at them some of these days, I should like you\r\nto come and help, but perhaps--Ha, little Mab, do you wonder what I\'m\r\nafter so long?  Here\'s a friend for you: as the little dog danced\r\ndelighted round him, and paid Aubrey her affectionate respects.  Her\r\ndelicate drawing-room beauty did not match with the spacious but\r\nneglected-looking room whence she issued.  It had three great\r\nuncurtained windows looking into the court, with deep window-seats,\r\nolive-coloured painted walls, the worse for damp and wear, a small\r\namount of old-fashioned solid furniture, and all Leonard\'s individual\r\ngoods, chiefly disposed of in a cupboard in the wall, but Averil\'s\r\nbeautiful water-coloured drawings hung over the chimney.  To Aubrey\'s\r\npetted home-bred notions it was very bare and dreary, and he could not\r\nhelp exclaiming, \'Well, they don\'t lodge you sumptuously!\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t fancy many clerks in her Majesty\'s dominions have so big and\r\nairy an apartment to boast of,\' said Leonard.  \'Let\'s see these flies\r\nof yours.\'\r\n\r\nTheir mysteries occupied the boys for some space; but Aubrey returned\r\nto the charge.  \'What is it that Hardy says you\'ll never put up with,\r\nLeonard?\'\r\n\r\n\'What did the old fellow say?\' asked Leonard, laughing; and as Aubrey\r\nrepeated the conversation, ending with the oracular prediction, he\r\nlaughed again, but said proudly, \'He\'ll see himself wrong then.  I\'ll\r\nput up with whatever I\'ve undertaken.\'\r\n\r\n\'But what does he mean?\'\r\n\r\n\'Serving one\'s apprenticeship, I suppose,\' said Leonard; \'they all\r\nthink me a fine gentleman, and above the work, I know, though I\'ve\r\nnever stuck at anything yet.  If I take to the business, I suppose it\r\nis capable of being raised up to me--it need not pull me down to it,\r\neh?\'\r\n\r\n\'There need be no down in the case,\' said Aubrey.  \'My father always\r\nsays there is no down except in meanness and wrong.  But,\' as if that\r\nmention brought a recollection to his mind, \'what o\'clock is it?  I\r\nmust not stay much longer.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll walk a bit of the way home with you,\' said Leonard, \'but I must\r\nbe back by five for dinner.  I go to rifle practice two days in the\r\nweek, and I don\'t like to miss the others, for Sam\'s often out, and the\r\npoor old man does not like being left alone at meals.\'\r\n\r\nThe two boys were at the room door, when Aubrey heard a step, felt the\r\nfustiness enlivened by the odour of a cigar, and saw a figure at the\r\ntop of the stairs.\r\n\r\n\'I say, Ward,\' observed Mr. Sam, in a rude domineering voice,\r\n\'Spelman\'s account must be all looked over to-night; he says that there\r\nis a blunder.  D\'ye hear?\'\r\n\r\n\'Very well.\'\r\n\r\n\'Who have you got there?\'\r\n\r\n\'It is Aubrey May.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! good morning to you,\' making a kind of salutation; \'have you been\r\nlooking at the water?  We\'ve got some fine fish there, if you like to\r\nthrow a line any day.--Well, that account must be done to-night, and if\r\nyou can\'t find the error, you\'ll only have to do it over again.\'\r\n\r\nLeonard\'s colour had risen a good deal, but he said nothing, and his\r\ncousin ran down-stairs and drove off in his dog-cart.\r\n\r\n\'Is it much of a business?\' said Aubrey, feeling extremely indignant.\r\n\r\n\'Look here,\' said Leonard, leading the way down-stairs and into the\r\noffice, where he pointed to two huge account books.  \'Every page in\r\nthat one must I turn over this blessed night; and if he had only told\r\nme three hours ago, I could have done the chief of it, instead of\r\nkicking my heels all the afternoon.\'\r\n\r\n\'Has he any right to order you about, out of office hours, and without\r\na civil word either?  Why do you stand it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Because I can stand anything better than being returned on Henry\'s\r\nhands,\' said Leonard, \'and he has spite enough for that.  The thing\r\nmust be done, and if he won\'t do it, I must, that\'s all.  Come along.\'\r\n\r\nAs they went out the unwieldy figure of the elder Mr. Axworthy was\r\nseen, leaning out of his open window, smoking a clay pipe.  He spoke in\r\na much more friendly tone, as he said, \'Going out, eh?  Mind the\r\ndinner-time.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sir,\' said Leonard, coming nearer, \'I\'m not going far.\'\r\n\r\n\'Who have you got there?\' was again asked.\r\n\r\n\'One of the young Mays, sir.  I was going to walk part of the way back.\'\r\n\r\nAubrey thought the grunt not very civil; and as the boys and Mab passed\r\nunder the gateway, Leonard continued, \'There\'s not much love lost\r\nbetween him and your father; he hates the very name.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should expect he would,\' said Aubrey, as if his hatred were an\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\n\'I fancy there\'s some old grievance,\' said Leonard, \'where he was wrong\r\nof course.  Not that that need hinder your coming over, Aubrey; I\'ve a\r\nright to my own friends, but--\'\r\n\r\n\'And so have I to mine,\' said Aubrey eagerly.\r\n\r\n\'But you see,\' added Leonard, \'I wouldn\'t have you do it--if--if it\r\nvexes your sister.  I can see you every Sunday, you know, and we can\r\nhave some fun together on Saturdays when the evenings get longer.\'\r\n\r\nAubrey\'s face fell; he had a strong inclination for Leonard\'s company,\r\nand likewise for the trout in the mill tail, and he did not like his\r\nindependence to be unappreciated.\r\n\r\n\'You see,\' said Leonard, laying his hand kindly on his shoulder, \'it is\r\nvery jolly of you, but I know they would hate it in the High Street if\r\nyou were often here, and it is not worth that.  Besides, Aubrey, to\r\ntell the plain truth, Sam\'s not fit company for any decent fellow.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t think how he came to ask me to fish.\'\r\n\r\n\'Just to show he is master, because he knew the poor old man would not\r\nlike it!  It is one reason he is so savage with me, because his uncle\r\ntook me without his consent.\'\r\n\r\n\'But, Leonard, it must be worse than the living at home ever was.\'\r\n\r\nLeonard laughed.  \'It\'s different being jawed in the way of business\r\nand at one\'s own home.  I\'d go through a good deal more than I do here\r\nin the week to have home what it is now on Sunday.  Why, Henry really\r\nseems glad to see me, and we have not had the shadow of a row since I\r\ncame over here.  Don\'t you tell Ave all this, mind, and you may just as\r\nwell not talk about it at home, you know, or they will think I\'m going\r\nto cry off.\'\r\n\r\nAubrey was going to ask what he looked to; but Leonard saw, or thought\r\nhe saw, a weasel in the hedge, and the consequent charge and pursuit\r\nfinished the dialogue, the boys parted, and Aubrey walked home, his\r\nsatisfaction in his expedition oozing away at every step, though his\r\nresolve to assert his liberty grew in proportion.\r\n\r\nOf course it had not been possible to conceal from Dr. May where Aubrey\r\nwas gone, and his annoyance had burst out vehemently, the whole round\r\nof objurgations against the Wards, the Vintry Mill, and his own folly\r\nin fostering the friendship, were gone through, and Ethel had come in\r\nfor more than she could easily bear, for not having prevented the\r\nescapade.  Gertrude had hardly ever seen her father so angry, and sat\r\nquaking for her brother; and Ethel meekly avoided answering again, with\r\nthe happy trustfulness of experienced love.\r\n\r\nAt last, as the tea was nearly over, Aubrey walked in, quite ready for\r\nself-defence.  Nobody spoke for a little while, except to supply him\r\nwith food; but presently Dr. May said, not at all in the tone in which\r\nhe had talked of his son\'s journey, \'You might as well have told me of\r\nyour intentions, Aubrey.\'\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t think they mattered to anybody,\' said Aubrey; \'we generally\r\ngo our own way in the afternoon.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh!\' said Dr. May.  \'Interference with the liberty of the subject?\'\r\n\r\nAubrey coloured, and felt he had not quite spoken truth.  \'I could not\r\ngive him up, father,\' he said, less defiantly.\r\n\r\n\'No, certainly not; but I had rather you only saw him at home.  It will\r\nbe more for our peace of mind.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, father,\' said Aubrey, \'I am not going there any more.  He told\r\nme not himself:\' and then with laughing eyes he added, \'He said you\r\nwould not like it, Ethel.\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor boy!\' said Ethel, greatly touched.\r\n\r\n\'Very right of him,\' said Dr. May, well pleased.  \'He is a fine lad,\r\nand full of proper feeling.  What sort of a berth has the old rogue\r\ngiven him, Aubrey?\'\r\n\r\nMuch relieved that matters had taken this course, Aubrey tried to tell\r\nonly as much as his friend would approve, but the medium was not easily\r\nfound, and pretty nearly the whole came out.  Dr. May was really\r\ndelighted to hear how Sam treated him.\r\n\r\n\'If that fellow takes the oppressive line, there may be some hope,\' he\r\nsaid.  \'His friendship is the worse danger than his enmity.\'\r\n\r\nWhen the sisters had bidden good night, the Doctor detained Aubrey to\r\nsay very kindly, \'My boy, I do not like to hear of your running counter\r\nto your sister.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m not going there again,\' said Aubrey, willing to escape.\r\n\r\n\'Wait a minute, Aubrey,\' said Dr. May; \'I want to tell you that I feel\r\nfor you in this matter more than my way of talking may have made it\r\nseem to you.  I have a great regard for your friend Leonard, and think\r\nhe has been scandalously used, and I don\'t want to lessen your\r\nattachment to him.  Far be it from me to think lightly of a friendship,\r\nespecially of one formed at your age.  Your very name, my boy, shows\r\nthat I am not likely to do that!\'\r\n\r\nAubrey smiled frankly, his offended self-assertion entirely melted.\r\n\r\n\'I know it is very hard on you, but you can understand that the very\r\nreasons that made me so averse to Leonard\'s taking this situation,\r\nwould make me anxious to keep you away from his relations there, not\r\nnecessarily from him.  As long as he is what he is now, I would not\r\nlift a finger to keep you from him.  Have I ever done so, Aubrey?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, papa.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nor will I, as long as he is what I see him now.  After this, Aubrey,\r\nis it too much to ask of you to keep out of the way of the persons with\r\nwhom he is thrown?\'\r\n\r\n\'I will do so, papa.  He wishes it himself.\'  Then with an effort, he\r\nadded, \'I am sorry I went to-day; I ought not, but--\' and he looked a\r\nlittle foolish.\r\n\r\n\'You did not like taking orders from the girls?  No wonder, Aubrey; I\r\nhave been very thankful to you for bearing it as you have done.  It is\r\nthe worst of home education that these spirits of manliness generally\r\nhave no vent but mischief.  But you are old enough now to be thankful\r\nfor such a friend and adviser as Ethel, and I don\'t imagine that she\r\norders you.\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said Aubrey, smiling and mumbling; \'but Daisy--\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I can quite understand the aggravation of Daisy happening to be\r\nright; but you must really be man enough to mind your own conscience,\r\neven if Daisy is imprudent enough to enforce it.\'\r\n\r\n\'It was not only that,\' said Aubrey, \'but I could not have Ward\r\nthinking I turned up my nose at his having got into business.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, Aubrey, he need never fancy it is the business that I object to,\r\nbut the men.  Make that clear to him, and ask him to this house as much\r\nas you please.  The more "thorough" he is in his business, the more I\r\nshall respect him.\'\r\n\r\nAubrey smiled, and thanked his father with a cleared brow, wondering at\r\nhimself for having gone without consulting him.\r\n\r\n\'Good night, my boy.  May this friendship of yours be a lifelong stay\r\nand blessing to you both, even though it may cost you some pain and\r\nself-command, as all good things must, Aubrey.\'\r\n\r\nThat evening Ethel had been writing to Cambridge.  Tom had passed his\r\nexamination with great credit, and taken an excellent degree, after\r\nwhich he projected a tour in Germany, for which he had for some time\r\nbeen economizing, as a well-earned holiday before commencing his course\r\nof hospitals and lectures.  Tom was no great correspondent, and had\r\ndrilled his sisters into putting nothing but the essential into their\r\nletters, instead, as he said, of concealing it in flummery.  This is a\r\nspecimen of the way Tom liked to be written to.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           \'Stoneborough, Feb. 20th.\r\n\'My Dear Tom,\r\n\r\n\'Dr. Spencer says nothing answers so well as a knapsack.  Get one at\r\n----. The price is L. s. d.  Order extra fittings as required,\r\nincluding a knife and fork.  Letters from N. Z. of the 1st of November,\r\nall well.  I wish Aubrey was going with you; he misses Leonard Ward so\r\nsorely, as to be tempted to follow him to the Vintry Mill.  I suspect\r\nyour words are coming true, and the days of petticoat government\r\nending.  However, even if he would not be in your way, he could not\r\nafford to lose six months\' study before going into residence.\r\n\r\n                                           \'Your affectionate sister,\r\n                                                    \'Etheldred May.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nTom wrote that he should spend a night in London and come home.  When\r\nhe came, the family exclaimed that his microscope, whose handsome case\r\nhe carried in his hand, was much grown.  \'And improved too, I hope\'\r\nsaid Tom, proceeding to show off various new acquisitions and exchanges\r\nin the way of eye-pieces, lenses, and other appliances of the most\r\nexpensive order, till his father exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\'Really, Tom, I wish I had the secret of your purse.\'\r\n\r\n\'The fact is,\' said Tom, \'that I thought more would be gained by\r\nstaying at home, so I turned my travels into a binocular tube,\' &C.\r\n\r\nAubrey and Gertrude shouted that Tom certainly did love the microscope\r\nbetter than any earthly thing; and he coolly accepted the inference.\r\n\r\nSomewhat later, he announced that he had decided that he should be\r\nbetter able to profit by the London lectures and hospitals, if he first\r\nstudied for half a year at the one at Stoneborough, under the direction\r\nof his father and Dr. Spencer.\r\n\r\nDr. May was extremely gratified, and really esteemed this one of the\r\ngreatest compliments his science had ever received; Dr. Spencer could\r\nnot help observing, \'I did not think it was in him to do such a wise\r\nthing.  I never can fathom the rogue.  I hope he was not bitten during\r\nhis benevolent exertions last winter.\'\r\n\r\nMeantime, Tom had observed that he had time to see that Aubrey was\r\ndecently prepared for Cambridge, and further promoted the boy to be his\r\nout-of-door companion, removing all the tedium and perplexity of the\r\nlast few weeks, though apparently merely indulging his own\r\ninclinations.  Ethel recognized the fruit of her letter, and could well\r\nforgive the extra care in housekeeping required for Tom\'s critical\r\ntastes, nay, the cool expulsion of herself and Gertrude from her twenty\r\nyears\' home, the schoolroom, and her final severance from Aubrey\'s\r\nstudies, though at the cost of a pang that reminded her of her\r\ngirlhood\'s sorrow at letting Norman shoot ahead of her.  She gave no\r\nhint; she knew that implicit reserve was the condition of his strange\r\nsilent confidence in her, and that it would be utterly forfeited unless\r\nshe allowed his fraternal sacrifice to pass for mere long-headed\r\nprudence.\r\n\r\nAubrey\'s Saturday and Sunday meetings with his friend were not yielded,\r\neven to Tom, who endeavoured to interfere with them, and would fain\r\nhave cut the connection with the entire family, treating Miss Ward with\r\nthe most distant and supercilious bows on the unpleasantly numerous\r\noccasions of meeting her in the street, and contriving to be markedly\r\nscornful in his punctilious civility to Henry Ward when they met at the\r\nhospital.  His very look appeared a sarcasm, to the fancy of the Wards;\r\nand he had a fashion of kindly inquiring after Leonard, that seemed to\r\nboth a deliberate reproach and insult.\r\n\r\nDisputes had become less frequent at Bankside since Leonard\'s\r\ndeparture, and few occasions of actual dissension arose; but the spirit\r\nof party was not extinguished, and the brother and sister had adopted\r\nlines that perhaps clashed less because they diverged more.\r\n\r\nAveril had, in reply to the constant exhortations to economize,\r\nresolved to decline all invitations, and this kept her constantly at\r\nhome, or with her harmonium, whereas Henry made such constant\r\nengagements, that their dining together was the exception, not the\r\nrule.  After conscientiously teaching her sisters in the morning, she\r\ndevoted the rest of her day to their walk, and to usefulness in the\r\nparish.  She liked her tasks, and would have been very happy in them,\r\nbut for the constant anxiety that hung over her lest her home should\r\nsoon cease to be her home.\r\n\r\nHenry\'s devotion to Mrs. Pugh could no longer be mistaken.  The\r\nconviction of his intentions grew upon his sister, first from a mere\r\nabsurd notion, banished from her mind with derision, then from a\r\nmisgiving angrily silenced, to a fixed expectation, confirmed by the\r\nevident opinion of all around her, and calling for decision and\r\nself-command on her own part.\r\n\r\nPerhaps her feelings were unnecessarily strong, and in some degree\r\nunjust to Mrs. Pugh; but she had the misfortune to be naturally proud\r\nand sensitive, as well as by breeding too refined in tone for most of\r\nthose who surrounded her.  She had taken a personal dislike to Mrs.\r\nPugh from the first; she regarded pretension as insincerity, and\r\nofficiousness as deliberate insult, and she took the recoil of her\r\ntaste for the judgment of principle.  To see such a woman ruling in her\r\nmother\'s, her own, home would be bad enough; but to be ruled by her,\r\nand resign to her the management of the children, would be intolerable\r\nbeyond measure.  Too unhappy to speak of her anticipations even to\r\nLeonard or to Mary May, she merely endeavoured to throw them off from\r\nday to day, till one evening, when the days had grown so long that she\r\ncould linger in the twilight in the garden before her singing practice,\r\nshe was joined by Henry, with the long apprehended \'I want to speak to\r\nyou, Ave.\'\r\n\r\nWas it coming?  Her heart beat so fast, that she could hardly hear his\r\nkind commencement about her excellent endeavours, and the house\'s\r\nunhappy want of a mistress, the children\'s advantage, and so on.  She\r\nknew it could only tend to one point, and longed to have it reached and\r\npassed.  Of course she would be prepared to hear who was the object of\r\nhis choice, and she could not but murmur \'Yes,\' and \'Well.\'\r\n\r\n\'And, Ave, you will, I hope, be gratified to hear that I am not\r\nentirely rejected.  The fact is, that I spoke too soon.\'  Averil could\r\nhave jumped for joy, and was glad it was too dusk for her face to be\r\nseen.  \'I do not believe that her late husband could have had any\r\nstrong hold on her affections; but she has not recovered the shock of\r\nhis loss, and entreated, as a favour granted to her sentiments of\r\nrespect for his memory, not to hear the subject mentioned for at least\r\nanother year.  I am permitted to visit at the house as usual, and no\r\ndifference is to be made in the terms on which we stand.  Now, Ave,\r\nwill you--may I ask of you, to do what you can to remove any impression\r\nthat she might not be welcome in the family?\'\r\n\r\n\'I never meant--\' faltered Averil, checked by sincerity.\r\n\r\n\'You have always been--so--so cold and backward in cultivating her\r\nacquaintance, that I cannot wonder if she should think it disagreeable\r\nto you; but, Ave, when you consider my happiness, and the immense\r\nadvantage to all of you, I am sure you will do what is in your power in\r\nmy behalf.\'  He spoke more affectionately and earnestly than he had\r\ndone for months; and Averil was touched, and felt that to hang back\r\nwould be unkind.\r\n\r\n\'I will try,\' she said.  \'I do hope it may turn out for your happiness,\r\nHenry.\'\r\n\r\n\'For all our happiness,\' said Henry, walking down to the gate and along\r\nthe road with her, proving all the way that he was acting solely for\r\nthe good of the others, and that Averil and the children would find\r\ntheir home infinitely happier.\r\n\r\nA whole year--a year\'s reprieve--was the one thought in Averil\'s head,\r\nthat made her listen so graciously, and answer so amiably, that Henry\r\nparted with her full of kind, warm feeling.\r\n\r\nAs the sage said, who was to be beheaded if he could not in a year\r\nteach the king\'s ass to speak--what might not happen in a year; the\r\nking might die, the ass might die, or he might die--any way there was\r\nso much gained: and Averil, for the time, felt as light-hearted as if\r\nMrs. Pugh had vanished into empty air.  To be sure, her own life had,\r\nof late, been far from happy; but this extension of it was bailed with\r\nsuppressed ecstasy--almost as an answer to her prayers.  Ah, Ave,\r\nlittle did you know what you wished in hoping for anything to prevent\r\nthe marriage!\r\n\r\nShe did obey her brother so far as to call upon Mrs. Pugh, whom she\r\nfound in ordinary mourning, and capless--a sign that dismayed her; but,\r\non the other hand, the lady, though very good-natured and patronizing,\r\nentertained her with the praises of King John, and showed her a copy of\r\nMagna Charta in process of illumination.  Also, during her call, Tom\r\nMay walked in with a little book on drops of water; and Averil found\r\nthe lady had become inspired with a microscopic furore, and was\r\nthinking of setting up a lens, and preparing objects for herself, under\r\ngood tuition.\r\n\r\nThough Averil was very desirous that Mrs. Pugh should refuse her\r\nbrother, yet this was the last service she wished the May family to\r\nrender her.  She was sure Tom May must dislike and despise the widow as\r\nmuch as she did; and since the whole town was unluckily aware of\r\nHenry\'s intentions, any interference with them was base and malicious,\r\nif in the way of mere amusement and flirtation.  She was resolved to\r\nsee what the game was, but only did see that her presence greatly\r\ndisconcerted \'Mr. Thomas May.\'\r\n\r\nHenry was wretched and irritable in the velvet paws of the widow, who\r\nencouraged him enough to give him hope, and then held him aloof, or was\r\nequally amiable to some one else.  Perhaps the real interpretation was,\r\nthat she loved attention.  She was in all sincerity resolved to observe\r\na proper period of widowhood, and not determined whether, when, or how,\r\nit should terminate: courtship amused her, and though attracted by\r\nHenry and his good house, the evidences of temper and harshness had\r\nmade her unwilling to commit herself; besides that, she was afraid of\r\nAveril, and she was more flattered by the civilities of a lioncel like\r\nHarvey Anderson; or if she could be sure of what Mr. Thomas May\'s\r\nintentions were, she would have preferred an embryo physician to a\r\nfull-grown surgeon--at any rate, it was right by her poor dear Mr. Pugh\r\nto wait.\r\n\r\nShe need not have feared having Averil as an inmate.  Averil talked it\r\nover with Leonard, and determined that no power on earth should make\r\nher live with Mrs. Pugh.  If that were necessary to forward his suit,\r\nshe would make it plain that she was ready to depart.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Leonard, if my uncle were but a nice sort of person, how pleasant\r\nit would be for me and the children to live there, and keep his house;\r\nand I could make him so comfortable, and nurse him!\'\r\n\r\n\'Never, Ave!\' cried Leonard; \'don\'t let the thing be talked of.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh no, I know it would not do with Samuel there; but should we be too\r\nyoung for your old scheme of having a cottage together near?\'\r\n\r\n\'I did not know what the Axworthys were like,\' returned Leonard.\r\n\r\n\'But need we see them much?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll tell you what, Ave, I\'ve heard them both--yes, the old man the\r\nworst of the two--say things about women that made my blood boil.\'\r\nLeonard was quite red as he spoke.  \'My father never let my mother see\r\nany of the concern, and now I know why.  I\'ll never let you do so.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then there is only one other thing to be done,\' said Averil; \'and that\r\nis for me to go back to school as a parlour boarder, and take the\r\nchildren with me.  It would be very good for them, and dear Mrs. Wood\r\nwould be very glad to have me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Leonard, \'that is the only right thing, Ave; and the Mays\r\nwill say so, too.  Have you talked it over with them!\'\r\n\r\n\'No.  I hate talking of this thing.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, you had better get their advice.  It is the best thing going!\'\r\nsaid Leonard, with a sigh that sounded as if he wished he had taken it.\r\n\r\nBut it was not to Averil that he said so.  To her he spoke brightly of\r\nserving the time for which he was bound to his uncle; then of making a\r\nfresh engagement, that would open a home to her; or, better still,\r\nsuppose Sam did not wish to go on with the business, he might take it,\r\nand make the mill the lovely place it might be.  It was to Aubrey May\r\nthat the boy\'s real feelings came out, as, on the Sunday evening, they\r\nslowly wandered along the bank of the river.  Aubrey had seen a\r\nspecimen of his life at the mill, and had been kept up to the knowledge\r\nof its events, and he well knew that Leonard was heartily sick of it.\r\nThat the occupation was uncongenial and tedious in the extreme to a boy\r\nof good ability and superior education--nay, that the drudgery was made\r\nunnecessarily oppressive, was not the point he complained of, though it\r\nwas more trying than he had expected, that was the bed that he had\r\nmade, and that he must lie upon.  It was the suspicion of frauds and\r\ntricks of the trade, and, still worse, the company that he lived in.\r\nSam Axworthy hated and tyrannized over him too much to make dissipation\r\nalluring; and he was only disgusted by the foul language, coarse\r\nmanners, and the remains of intemperance worked on in violent temper.\r\n\r\nThe old man, though helpless and past active vice, was even more coarse\r\nin mind and conversation than his nephew; and yet his feebleness, and\r\nSam\'s almost savage treatment of him, enlisted Leonard\'s pity on his\r\nside.  In general, the old man was kind to Leonard, but would abuse him\r\nroundly when the evidences of his better principles and training, or\r\nhis allegiance to Dr. May, came forward, and Leonard, though greatly\r\ncompassionating him, could not always bear his reproaches with\r\npatience, and was held back from more attention to him than common\r\nhumanity required, by an unlucky suggestion that he was currying favour\r\nin the hope of supplanting Sam.\r\n\r\n\'Old Hardy is the only honest man in the place, I do believe,\' said\r\nLeonard.  \'I\'ll tell you what, Aubrey, I have made up my mind, there is\r\none thing I will not do.  If ever they want to make me a party to any\r\nof their cheatings, I\'ll be off.  That window and the cedar-tree stand\r\nvery handy.  I\'ve been out there to bathe in the early summer mornings,\r\nplenty of times already, so never you be surprised if some fine day you\r\nhear--non est inventus.\'\r\n\r\n\'And where would you go?\'\r\n\r\n\'Get up to London, and see if my quarter\'s salary would take me out in\r\nthe steerage to some diggings or other.  What would your brother say to\r\nme if I turned up at the Grange--New Zealand?\'\r\n\r\n\'Say!  Mention Ethel, and see what he would not say.\'\r\n\r\nAnd the two boys proceeded to arrange the details of the evasion in\r\nsuch vivid colouring, that they had nearly forgotten all present\r\ntroubles, above all when Leonard proceeded to declare that New Zealand\r\nwas too tame and too settled for him, he should certainly find\r\nsomething to do in the Feejee Isles, where the high spirit of the\r\nnatives, their painted visages, and marvellous head-dresses, as\r\ndepicted in Captain Erskine\'s voyage, had greatly fired his fancy, and\r\nthey even settled how the gold fields should rebuild the Market Cross.\r\n\r\n\'And when I\'m gone, Aubrey, mind you see to Mab,\' he said, laughing.\r\n\r\n\'Oh!  I thought Mab was to act Whittington\'s cat.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m afraid they would eat her up; besides, there\'s the voyage.  No,\r\nyou must keep her till I come home, even if she is to end like Argus.\r\nWould you die of joy at seeing me, eh, little black neb?\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                             Let us meet,\r\n  And question this most bloody piece of work,\r\n  To know it farther.                   Macbeth\r\n\r\n\r\n\'If you please, sir, Master Hardy from the Vintry Mill wants to see\r\nyou, said a voice at Dr. May\'s door early in the morning; and the\r\nDoctor completed his dressing in haste, muttering to himself\r\nexclamations of concern that the old man\'s malady should have returned.\r\n\r\nOn entering the study, Hardy\'s appearance, whiter than even the\r\nproverbial hue of his trade, his agitation of feature, confused eye,\r\nand trembling lip, inspired fears that the case was more alarming than\r\nhad been apprehended; but to cheer him, the Doctor began, \'Frightened\r\nabout yourself, Master Hardy, eh!  You\'ve come out without breakfast,\r\nand that\'s enough to put any man out of heart.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, sir,\' said the old man, \'it is nothing about myself; I wish it\r\nwere no worse; but I\'ve not got the heart to go to tell the poor young\r\ngentleman, and I thought--\'\r\n\r\n\'What--what has happened to the boy?\' exclaimed Dr. May, sharply,\r\nstanding as if ready to receive the rifle shot which he already\r\nbelieved had destroyed Leonard.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s what we can\'t say, sir,\' returned Hardy; \'but he is gone, no\r\none knows where.  And, sir, my poor master was found at five o\'clock\r\nthis morning, in his chair in his sitting-room, stone dead from a blow\r\non the head.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mind what you are saying!\' shouted the Doctor passionately.  \'You old\r\nscoundrel, you don\'t mean to tell me that you are accusing the lad!\'\r\n\r\n\'I accuse nobody, sir,\' said the old man, standing his ground, and\r\nspeaking steadily, but respectfully, \'I wouldn\'t say nothing to bring\r\nany one into trouble if I could help it, and I came to ask you what was\r\nto be done.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes; I beg your pardon, Hardy, but it sounded enough to overset\r\none.  Your poor master murdered, you say!\'\r\n\r\nHardy nodded assent.\r\n\r\n\'And young Ward missing?  Why, the burglars must have hurt the poor\r\nfellow in defending his uncle.  Have you searched the place?\'\r\n\r\n\'I never thought of that, sir,\' said Hardy, his countenance much\r\nrelieved; \'it would be more like such a young gentleman as Mr. Ward.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then we\'ll get over to the mill as fast as we can, and see what can be\r\ndone,\' said Dr. May, snatching up his hat and gloves. \'You come and\r\nwalk with me to Bankside, and tell me by the way about this terrible\r\nbusiness.  Good heavens! they\'ll have thrown the boy into the river!\'\r\n\r\nAnd calling out that his carriage should follow to Bankside, the Doctor\r\ndashed up-stairs, and knocked at Ethel\'s door.  \'My dear,\' he said,\r\n\'there has been a robbery or something at the Vintry Mill.  I must go\r\nand see Henry Ward about it.  Poor old Axworthy is murdered, and I\'m\r\nterribly afraid Leonard has met with some foul play.  You or Mary had\r\nbetter go and see about Ave presently, but don\'t believe a word of\r\nanything till you see me again.\'\r\n\r\nAnd shutting the door, while Ethel felt as if the room were reeling\r\nround with her, Dr. May was in a few seconds more hastening along by\r\nHardy\'s side, extracting from him the little he had to tell.  The old\r\nman had been unlocking the door of the mill at five o\'clock, when he\r\nwas summoned by loud shrieks from the window of Mr. Axworthy\'s\r\nsitting-room, and found that the little maid had been appalled by the\r\nsight of her master sunk forward from his gouty chair upon the table,\r\nhis hair covered with blood.  Hardy had been the first to touch him,\r\nand to perceive that he had long been dead.  The housekeeper, the only\r\nother servant who slept in the house, had rushed in half-dressed; but\r\nneither nephew appeared.  Young Axworthy had gone the previous day to\r\nthe county races, leaving the time of his return doubtful, and Leonard\r\nWard did not answer when called.  It was then found that his room was\r\nempty, his bed untouched, and the passage window outside his door left\r\nopen.  The terrified servants held confused consultation, and while the\r\ngroom had hurried off to give the alarm at Whitford, and ride on in\r\nsearch of Sam Axworthy, Hardy had taken another horse and started to\r\ninform Henry Ward, but his heart failing him, he had come to beg the\r\nDoctor to break the intelligence to the family.\r\n\r\nDr. May had few doubts that the robbers must have entered by the\r\npassage window, and meeting resistance from Leonard, must have dragged\r\nhim out, and perhaps thrown him from it, then having gone on to their\r\nmurderous work in the old man\'s sitting-room.  In that great rambling\r\nhouse, where the maids slept afar off, and the rats held nightly\r\ngambols, strange noises were not likely to be observed; and the thought\r\nof Leonard lying stunned and insensible on the grass, made the Doctor\'s\r\npace almost a run, as if he were hastening to the rescue.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Ward sent down word that he was not up, Dr. May replied that\r\nhe must see him in bed, and followed upon the very heels of the\r\nmessenger, encountering no amiable face, for Henry had armed himself\r\nfor defence against any possible reproaches for his treatment of any\r\npatient.  Even when Dr. May began, \'Henry, my poor fellow, I have\r\nfrightful news for you,\' his month was opening to reply, \'I knew we\r\nshould lose that case,\' let the patient be who he might, when the few\r\nsimple words put to flight all petulant jealousy, and restored Henry\r\nWard to what he had been when in his hour of sickness and affliction he\r\nhad leant in full confidence on Dr. May\'s unfailing kindness.\r\n\r\nHe was dressed by the time the brougham was at the door, and would have\r\nhurried off without telling his sister of the alarm; but Dr. May,\r\nknowing that the town must soon be ringing with the news, was sending\r\nhim to Averil\'s room, when both rejoiced to see Mary enter the house.\r\nCharging her to keep Averil quiet, and believe nothing but what came\r\nfrom themselves, they thrust on her the terrible commission and\r\nhastened away, dwelling on the hope that every moment might be\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nOld Hardy had already mounted his cart-horse, and for him farm roads so\r\nshortened the distance, that he received them at the entrance of the\r\ncourtyard, which was crowded with excited gazers and important\r\npolicemen.\r\n\r\n\'Found him?\' was the instantaneous question of both; but Hardy shook\r\nhis head so sadly, that the Doctor hastily exclaimed, \'What then?\'\r\n\r\n\'Sir,\' said Hardy very low, and with a deprecating look, \'he did go up\r\nby the mail train to London last night--got in at Blewer station at\r\n12.15.  They have telegraphed up, sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll lay my life it is all a mistake,\' said Dr. May, grasping Henry\'s\r\narm as if to give him support, and looking him in the face as though\r\nresolved that neither should be cast down.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s not all, sir,\' added Hardy, still addressing himself to the\r\nelder gentleman.  \'There\'s his rifle, sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, he was not shot!\' sharply cried Dr. May.  \'You told me so\r\nyourself.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, sir; but--You\'ll see for yourself presently!  There\'s the blood\r\nand gray hairs on the stock, sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'Never fear, Henry; we shall see,\' said Dr. May, pressing on, and\r\nadding as soon as they were out of hearing,  \'Nothing those folks, even\r\nthe best of them, like so well as laying on horrors thick enough.\'\r\n\r\nA policeman stood at the house door to keep off idlers; but Dr. May\'s\r\ncharacter and profession, as well as his municipal rank, caused way to\r\nbe instantly made for them.  They found a superintendent within, and he\r\nat once began, \'Most unfortunate business, Mr. Mayor--very mysterious;\'\r\nthen, as a sign from the Doctor made him aware of Henry Ward\'s near\r\nconcern, he added, \'Shall I inform young Mr. Axworthy that you are\r\nhere?\'\r\n\r\n\'Is he come?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sir.  He had only slept at the Three Goblets, not half a mile\r\nacross the fields, you know, Mr. Mayor--came home too late to disturb\r\nthe house here, slept there, and was on the spot at the first\r\nintelligence--before I was myself,\' added the superintendent a little\r\njealously.\r\n\r\n\'Where is he?\'\r\n\r\n\'In his room, sir.  He was extremely overcome, and retired to his room\r\nas soon as the necessary steps had been taken.  Would you wish to see\r\nthe room, sir?  We are keeping it locked till the inquest takes place;\r\nbut--\'\r\n\r\nHenry asked, \'When?\' his first word since his arrival, and almost\r\ninarticulate.\r\n\r\nHe was answered that it would probably be at two that afternoon; the\r\nWhitford coroner had intimated that he was ready, and the down train\r\nwould be in by one.  A telegram had just arrived, reporting that the\r\nelectric message had anticipated the mail train, and that young Mr.\r\nWard would be brought down in time.\r\n\r\n\'Never mind, never heed, Henry,\' persisted Dr. May, pressing the young\r\nman\'s arm as they proceeded to the door of the sitting-room; \'he must\r\nbe intensely shocked, but he will explain the whole.  Nay, I\'ve no\r\ndoubt we shall clear him.  His rifle, indeed!  I could swear to his\r\nrifle anywhere.\'\r\n\r\nThe superintendent had by this time opened the door of the\r\nsitting-room, communicating on one side with the office, on the other\r\nwith the old man\'s bed-room.\r\n\r\nExcept that the body had been carried to the bed in the inner chamber,\r\nall remained as it had been found.  There were no signs of robbery--not\r\neven of a struggle.  The cushions of the easy-chair still bore the\r\nimpress of the sitter\'s weight; the footstool was hardly pushed aside;\r\nthe massive library table was undisturbed; the silver spoons and\r\nsugar-tongs beside the tumbler and plate on the supper tray; the yellow\r\nlight of the lamp still burnt; not a paper was ruffled, not a drawer\r\npulled out.  Only a rifle stood leaning against the window shutter, and\r\ntowards it both friend and brother went at once, hoping and trusting\r\nthat it would be a stranger to their eyes.\r\n\r\nAlas! alas! only too familiar were the rich brown mottlings of the\r\nstock, the steel mountings, the eagle crest, and twisted H. E. cipher!\r\nand in sickness of heart the Doctor could not hide from himself the\r\ndark clot of gore and the few white hairs adhering to the wood, and\r\nanswering to the stain that dyed the leather of the desk.\r\n\r\nHenry could not repress an agonized groan, and averted his face; but\r\nhis companion undaunted met the superintendent\'s eye and query, \'You\r\nknow it, sir!\'\r\n\r\n\'I do.  It was my son-in-law\'s present to him.  I wonder where he kept\r\nit, for the ruffians to get hold of it.\'\r\n\r\nThe superintendent remained civil and impassive, and no one spoke to\r\nbreak the deathly hush of the silent room, filled with the appliances\r\nof ordinary business life, but tainted with the awful unexplained mark\r\nthat there had been the foot of the shedder of blood in silence and at\r\nunawares.\r\n\r\nThe man in authority at length continued his piteous exhibition.  Dr.\r\nRankin of Whitford had arrived on the first alarm; but would not the\r\ngentlemen see the body?  And he led them on, Dr. May\'s eyes on the\r\nalert to seize on anything exculpatory, but detecting nothing, seeing\r\nonly the unwieldy helpless form and aged feeble countenance of the\r\ndeceased, and receiving fresh impressions of the brutality and\r\ncowardice of the hand that could have struck the blow.  He looked,\r\nexamined, defined the injury, and explained that it must have caused\r\ninstant death, thus hoping to divert attention from his pale\r\nhorror-stricken companion, whose too apparent despondency almost\r\nprovoked him.\r\n\r\nAt the Doctor\'s request they were taken up the staircase into the\r\ncorridor, and shown the window, which had been found nearly closed but\r\nnot fastened, as though it had been partially shut down from the\r\noutside.  The cedar bough almost brushed the glass, and the slope of\r\nturf came so high up the wall, that an active youth could easily swing\r\nhimself down to it; and the superintendent significantly remarked that\r\nthe punt was on the farther side of the stream, whereas the evening\r\nbefore it had been on the nearer.  Dr. May leant out over the\r\nwindow-sill, still in the lingering hope of seeing--he knew not what,\r\nbut he only became oppressed by the bright still summer beauty of the\r\ntrees and grass and sparkling water, insensible of the horror that\r\nbrooded over all.  He drew back his head; and as the door hard by was\r\nopened, Leonard\'s little dog sprang from her basket kennel, wagging her\r\ntail in hopes of her master, but in her disappointment greeting one\r\nwhom dogs always hailed as a friend,\r\n\r\n\'Poor little doggie! good little Mab!  If only you could tell us!\' and\r\nthe creature fondly responded to his gentle hand, though keeping aloof\r\nfrom Henry, in mindfulness of past passages between them, while Henry\r\ncould evidently not bear to look at her.\r\n\r\nThey gazed round the room, but it conveyed no elucidation of the\r\nmystery.  There were Leonard\'s books in their range on the drawers, his\r\nfossils in his cupboard, his mother\'s photograph on his mantel-piece,\r\nhis sister\'s drawings on the wall.  His gray uniform lay on the bed as\r\nif recently taken off, his ordinary office coat was folded on a chair,\r\nand he seemed to have dressed and gone in his best clothes.  While\r\nanxiously seeking some note of explanation, they heard a step, and Sam\r\nAxworthy entered, speaking fast and low in apology for not having\r\nsooner appeared, but he had been thoroughly upset; as indeed he looked,\r\nhis whole appearance betraying the disorder of the evening\'s\r\ndissipation, followed by the morning\'s shock.\r\n\r\nMost unfortunate, he said, that he had not returned earlier.  His\r\nfriend Black--Tom Black, of Edsall Green--had driven him home in his\r\ndog-cart, set him down at the turn to cross the fields--moon as light\r\nas day--no notion, of the lateness till he got in sight of the great\r\nclock, and saw it was half-past twelve; so knowing the early habits of\r\nthe place, he had thought it best to turn back, and get a bed at the\r\nThree Goblets.  If he had only come home, he might have prevented\r\nmischief!  There ensued a few commonplace words on the old man\'s infirm\r\nstate, yet his independent habits, and reluctance to let any servant\r\nassist him, or even sleep near him.  Sam spoke as if in a dream, and\r\nwas evidently so unwell, that Dr. May thought it charitable to follow\r\nthe dictates of his own disgust at breaking bread in that house of\r\nhorrors, and refuse offers of breakfast.  He said he must go home, but\r\nwould return for the inquest, and asked whether Henry would remain to\r\nmeet his brother.\r\n\r\n\'No, no, thank you,\' said Henry huskily, as with the driest of throats,\r\nand a perceptible shudder, he turned to go away; the Doctor pausing to\r\ncaress little Mab, and say, \'I had better take home this poor little\r\nthing.  She may come to harm here, and may be a comfort to the sister.\'\r\n\r\nNo objection came from Sam, but Mab herself ran back to her house, and\r\neven snarled at the attempt to detach her from it.  \'You are a faithful\r\nlittle beast,\' he said, \'and your master will soon be here to set all\r\nstraight, so I will leave you for the present;\' and therewith he signed\r\nfarewell, and breathed more freely as he gained the outer air.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll tell you what, Henry,\' he said, as they drove out of the\r\ncourtyard, \'we\'ll bring out Bramshaw to watch the case.  He will see\r\nthrough this horrible mystery, and throw the suspicion in the right\r\nquarter, whatever that may be, depend upon it.\'\r\n\r\nHenry had thrown himself back in the carriage with averted face, and\r\nonly answered by a groan.\r\n\r\n\'Come, don\'t be so downcast,\' said Dr. May; \'it is a frightful affair,\r\nno doubt, and Leonard has chosen a most unlucky moment for this\r\nescapade; but he will have a thorough warning against frolics.\'\r\n\r\n\'Frolics indeed!\' said Henry, bitterly.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I\'ll be bound that\'s all he has attempted, and it has got him\r\ninto a horrid scrape; and ten to one but the police have got the real\r\nruffians in their hands by this time.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have no hope,\' said Henry.\r\n\r\n\'More shame for you not to feel a certain confidence that He who sees\r\nall will show the right.\'\r\n\r\n\'If!\' said Henry, breaking off with a sound and look of such intense\r\nmisery as almost to stagger the Doctor himself, by reminding him of\r\nLeonard\'s violent temper, and the cause Henry had to remember his\r\npromptness of hand; but that Ethel\'s pupil, Aubrey\'s friend, the boy of\r\ningenuous face, could under any provocation strike helpless old age,\r\nor, having struck, could abscond without calling aid, actuated by\r\nterror, not by pity or repentance, was more than Dr. May could believe,\r\nand after brief musing, he broke out in indignant refutation.\r\n\r\n\'I should have thought so.  I wish I still could believe so\' sighed\r\nHenry; \'but--\' and there they lapsed into silence, till, as they came\r\nnear the town, Dr. May offered to set him down at Bankside.\r\n\r\n\'No! no, thank you,\' he cried in entreaty.  \'I cannot see her--Ave.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then come home with me.  You shall see no one, and you will look up\r\nwhen you are not faint and fasting.  You young men don\'t stand up\r\nagainst these things like us old stagers.\'\r\n\r\nAs the carriage stopped, several anxious faces were seen on the watch,\r\nbut the Doctor signed them back till he had deposited Henry in his\r\nstudy, and then came among them.\r\n\r\nGertrude was the first to speak.  \'O, papa, papa, what is it!  Mrs.\r\nPugh has been here to ask, and Ethel won\'t let me hear, though Tom and\r\nAubrey know.\'\r\n\r\n\'I took refuge in your order to believe nothing till you came,\' said\r\nEthel, with hands tightly clasped together.\r\n\r\n\'It is true, then?\' asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\'True that it looks as bad as bad can be,\' said the Doctor, sighing\r\nheavily, and proceeding to state the aspect of the case.\r\n\r\n\'It is a trick--a plot,\' cried Aubrey passionately; \'I know it is! He\r\nalways said he would run away if they tried to teach him dishonesty;\r\nand now they have done this and driven him away, and laid the blame on\r\nhim.  Ethel, why don\'t you say you are sure of it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Leonard would be changed indeed if this were so,\' said Ethel,\r\ntrembling as she stood, and hardly able to speak articulately.\r\n\r\nAubrey broke out with a furious \'If,\' very different from Henry Ward\'s.\r\n\r\n\'It would not be the Leonard we knew at Coombe,\' said Ethel.  \'He might\r\nbe blind with rage, but he would never be cowardly.  No. Unless he own\r\nit, nothing shall ever make me believe it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Own it!  For shame, Ethel,\' cried Aubrey. And even the Doctor\r\nexclaimed, \'You are as bad as poor Henry himself, who has not got soul\r\nenough to be capable of trusting his brother.\'\r\n\r\n\'I do trust,\' said Ethel, looking up.  \'I shall trust his own word,\'\r\nand she sat down without speaking, and knitted fast, but her needles\r\nclattered.\r\n\r\n\'And how about that poor girl at Bankside?\' said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\'I went down there,\' said Tom, \'just to caution the servants against\r\nbringing in stories.  She found out I was there, and I had to go in and\r\nmake the best of it.\'\r\n\r\n\'And what sort of a best?\' said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\'Why, she knew he used to get out in the morning to bathe, and was\r\npersuaded he had been drowned; so I told her I knew he was alive and\r\nwell, and she would hear all about it when you came back.  I brought\r\nthe youngest child away with me, and Gertrude has got her up-stairs;\r\nthe other would not come.  Poor thing!  Mary says she is very good and\r\npatient; and I must say she was wonderfully reasonable when I talked to\r\nher.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, Tom,\' said his father with warmth, \'it was very kind of\r\nyou.  I wonder if Ave knew anything of this runaway business; it might\r\nbe the saving of him!\'\r\n\r\n\'I did,\' said Aubrey eagerly; \'at least, I know he said he would not\r\nstay if they wanted to put him up to their dishonest tricks; and he\r\ntalked of that very window!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, you imprudent fellow; and you were telling Mrs. Pugh so, if I\r\nhadn\'t stopped you,\' said Tom.  \'You\'ll be taken up for an accomplice\r\nnext, if you don\'t hold your tongue.\'\r\n\r\n\'What did he say?\' asked the Doctor, impatiently; and then declared\r\nthat he must instantly go to Bankside, as soon as both he and Henry had\r\ntaken some food; \'for,\' he added, \'we are both too much shaken to deal\r\nrationally with her.\'\r\n\r\nEthel started up in shame and dismay at having neglected to order\r\nanything.  The Doctor was served in the study alone with Henry, and\r\nafter the briefest meal, was on his way to Bankside.\r\n\r\nHe found Averil with the crimson cheek and beseeching eye that he knew\r\nso well, as she laid her trembling hand on his, and mutely looked up\r\nlike a dumb creature awaiting a blow.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, my dear,\' he said, tenderly, \'your brother needs prayer such as\r\nwhen we watched him last year, he is in peril of grave suspicion.\' And\r\nas she stood waiting and watching for further explanation, he\r\ncontinued, \'My dear, he told you everything.  You do not know of any\r\nnotion of his of going away, or going out without leave?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why is Leonard to be always suspected of such things?\' cried Averil.\r\n\'He never did them!\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you know?\' persisted Dr. May.\r\n\r\n\'But you are mayor!\' cried Averil, indignantly, withdrawing her hand.\r\n\'You want me to accuse him!\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear, if I were ten times mayor, it would make no difference.  My\r\njurisdiction does not even cross the river here; and if it did, this is\r\na graver case than I deal with.  I am come, as his friend, to beg you\r\nto help me to account for his unhappy absence in any harmless way.\r\nWere it ever so foolish or wrong, it would be the best news that ever I\r\nheard.\'\r\n\r\n\'But--but I can\'t,\' said Averil.  \'I never knew he was going out! I\r\nknow he used to get out at the passage window to bathe and fish before\r\nthe house was astir--and--you know he is safe, Dr. May?\'\r\n\r\nDr. May would almost sooner have known that he was at the bottom of the\r\ndeepest pool in the river, than where he was.  \'He is safe, my poor\r\nchild.  He is well, and I trust he will be able to prove his innocence;\r\nbut he must so account for his absence as to clear himself.  Averil,\r\nthere is a charge against him--of being concerned in your uncle\'s\r\ndeath.\'\r\n\r\nAveril\'s eyes dilated, and she breathed short and fast, standing like a\r\nstatue.  Little Minna, whom the Doctor had scarcely perceived, standing\r\nin a dark corner, sprang forward, exclaiming, \'O, Ave, don\'t be afraid!\r\nNobody can hurt him for what he did not do!\'\r\n\r\nThe words roused Averil, and starting forward, she cried, \'Dr. May, Dr.\r\nMay, you will save him!  He is fatherless and motherless, and his\r\nbrother has always been harsh to him; but you will not forsake him; you\r\nsaid you would be a father to us!  Oh, save Leonard!\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear, as I would try to save my own son, I will do my utmost for\r\nhim; but little or nothing depends on me or on any man.  By truth and\r\njustice he must stand or fall; and you must depend on the Father of the\r\nfatherless, who seeth the truth! as this dear child tells you,\' with\r\nhis hand on Minna\'s head, \'he cannot be really injured while he is\r\ninnocent.\'\r\n\r\nAwed into calm, Averil let him seat her beside him, and put her in\r\npossession of the main facts of the case, Minna standing by him, her\r\nhand in his, evidently understanding and feeling all that passed.\r\n\r\nNeither could throw light on anything.  Leonard had been less\r\ncommunicative to them than to Aubrey, and had kept his resolution of\r\nuncomplainingly drinking the brewst he had brewed for himself.  All\r\nAveril could tell was, that her uncle had once spoken to Henry in\r\ncommendation of his steadiness and trustworthiness, though at the same\r\ntime abusing him for airs and puppyism.\r\n\r\n\'Henry would tell you.  Where is Henry?\' she added.\r\n\r\n\'In my study.  He could not bear to bring you these tidings.  You must\r\nbe ready to comfort him, Ave.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t let him come,\' she cried.  \'He never was kind to Leonard.  He\r\ndrove him there.  I shall always feel that it was his doing.\'\r\n\r\n\'Averil,\' said Dr. May gravely, \'do you forget how much that increases\r\nhis suffering?  Nothing but mutual charity can help you through this\r\nfiery trial.  Do not let anger and recrimination take from you the last\r\nshreds of comfort, and poison your prayers. Promise me to be kind to\r\nHenry, for indeed he needs it.\'\r\n\r\n\'O, Dr. May,\' said Minna, looking up with her eyes full of tears,\r\n\'indeed I will.  I was cross to Henry because he was cross to Leonard,\r\nbut I won\'t be so any more.\'\r\n\r\nAve drooped her head, as if it were almost impossible to her to speak.\r\n\r\nDr. May patted Minna\'s dark head caressingly, and said to the elder\r\nsister, \'I will not urge you more.  Perhaps you may have Leonard back,\r\nand then joy will open your hearts; or if not, my poor Ave, the sight\r\nof Henry will do more than my words.\'\r\n\r\nMary looked greatly grieved, but said nothing, only following her\r\nfather to take his last words and directions.  \'Keep her as quiet as\r\nyou can.  Do not worry her, but get out this root of bitterness if you\r\ncan.  Poor, poor things!\'\r\n\r\n\'That little Minna is a dear child!\' said Mary.  \'She is grown so much\r\nolder than Ella, or than she was last year.  She seems to understand\r\nand feel like a grown-up person.  I do think she may soften poor Ave\r\nmore than I can; but, papa, there is excuse.  Mr. Ward must have made\r\nthem more miserable than we guessed.\'\r\n\r\n\'The more reason she must forgive him.  O, Mary, I fear a grievous\r\nlesson is coming to them; but I must do all I can.  Good-bye, my dear;\r\ndo the best you can for them;\' and he set forth again with a bleeding\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nAt the attorney\'s office, he found the principal from home, but the\r\npartner, Edward Anderson, on the qui vive for a summons to attend on\r\nbehalf of his fellow-townsman, and confident that however bad were the\r\npresent aspect of affairs, his professional eye would instantly find a\r\nclue.\r\n\r\nAubrey was in an agony of excitement, but unable to endure the notion\r\nof approaching the scene of action; and his half-choked surly \'Don\'t\'\r\nwas sufficient to deter his brother Thomas, who had never shown himself\r\nso kind, considerate, and free from sneer or assumption.  In \'hours of\r\nease\' he might seem selfish and exacting, but a crisis evoked the\r\nlatent good in him, and drew him out of himself.\r\n\r\nNor would Henry return to Bankside.  After many vacillations, the\r\nmoment for starting found him in a fit of despair about the family\r\ndisgrace, only able to beg that \'the unhappy boy\' should be assured\r\nthat no expense should be spared in his defence; or else, that if he\r\nwere cleared and returned home, his welcome should be most joyful. But\r\nthere Henry broke off, groaned, said they should never look up again,\r\nand must leave the place.\r\n\r\nExcept for Averil\'s own sake, Dr. May would almost have regretted his\r\nexhortations in favour of her eldest brother.\r\n\r\nIn due time the Doctor arrived at the mill, where the inquest was to\r\ntake place, as the public-house was small, and inconveniently distant;\r\nand there was ample accommodation in the large rambling building.  So\r\ncrowded was the court-yard, that the Doctor did not easily make his way\r\nto the steps of the hall door; but there, after one brief question to\r\nthe policeman in charge, he waited, though several times invited in.\r\n\r\nBefore long, all eyes turned one way, as a closed fly, with a policeman\r\non the box, drove in at the gateway, stopped, and between the two men\r\non guard appeared a tall young figure.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor\'s first glance showed him a flushed and weary set of\r\nfeatures, shocked and appalled; but the eyes, looking straight up in\r\ntheir anxiety, encountered his with an earnest grateful appeal for\r\nsympathy, answered at once by a step forward with outstretched hand.\r\nThe grip of the fingers was heated, agitated, convulsive, but not\r\ntremulous; and there was feeling, not fear, in the low husky voice that\r\nsaid, \'Thank you. Is Henry here?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, he is too--too much overcome; but he hopes to see you at home\r\nto-night; and here is Edward Anderson, whom he has sent to watch the\r\nproceedings for you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you,\' said Leonard, acknowledging Edward\'s greeting.  \'As far as\r\nI am concerned, I can explain all in a minute; but my poor uncle--I\r\nlittle thought--\'\r\n\r\nThere was no opportunity for further speech in private, for the coroner\r\nhad already arrived, and the inquiry had been only deferred until\r\nLeonard should have come.  The jury had been viewing the body, and the\r\nproceedings were to take place in the large low dining-room, where the\r\nsouthern windows poured in a flood of light on the faces of the persons\r\ncrowded together, and the reflections from the rippling water danced on\r\nthe ceiling.  Dr. May had a chair given him near the coroner, and\r\nkeenly watched the two nephews--one seated next to him, the other at\r\nsome distance, nearly opposite.  Both young men looked haggard,\r\nshocked, and oppressed: the eye of Axworthy was unceasingly fixed on an\r\ninkstand upon the table, and never lifted, his expression never varied;\r\nand Leonard\'s glance flashed inquiringly from one speaker to another,\r\nand his countenance altered with every phase of the evidence.\r\n\r\nThe first witness was Anne Ellis, the young maid-servant, who told of\r\nher coming down at ten minutes after five that morning, the 6th of\r\nJuly, and on going in to clean the rooms, finding her master sunk\r\nforward on the table.  Supposing him to have had a fit, she had run to\r\nthe window and screamed for help, when Master Hardy, the foreman, and\r\nMrs. Giles, the housekeeper, had come in.\r\n\r\nJames Hardy deposed to having heard the girl\'s cry while he was\r\nunlocking the mill door.  Coming in by the low sash-window, which stood\r\nopen, he had gone up to his master, and had seen the wound on the head,\r\nand found the body quite cold, Mrs. Giles coming in, they had carried\r\nit to the bed in the next room; and he had gone to call the young\r\ngentlemen, but neither was in his room.  He knew that it had been left\r\nuncertain whether Mr. Samuel would return to sleep at home between the\r\ntwo days of the county races, but he did not expect Mr. Ward to be out;\r\nand had then observed that his bed had not been slept in, and that the\r\npassage window outside his room was partly open.  He had then thought\r\nit best to go into Stoneborough to inform the family.\r\n\r\nRebecca Giles, the housekeeper, an elderly woman, crying violently,\r\nrepeated the evidence as to the discovery of the body.  The last time\r\nshe had seen her master alive, was when she had carried in his supper\r\nat nine o\'clock, when he had desired her to send Mr. Ward to him; and\r\nhad seemed much vexed to hear that the young man had not returned from\r\nrifle practice, little thinking, poor old gentleman!--but here the\r\nhousekeeper was recalled to her subject.  The window was then open, as\r\nit was a sultry night, but the blind down.  Her master was a good deal\r\ncrippled by gout, and could not at that time move actively nor write,\r\nbut could dress himself, and close a window.  He disliked being\r\nassisted; and the servants were not in the habit of seeing him from the\r\ntime his supper was brought in till breakfast next morning. She had\r\nseen Mr. Ward come home at twenty minutes or half after nine, in\r\nuniform, carrying his rifle; she had given the message, and he had gone\r\ninto the sitting-room without putting down the rifle.  She believed it\r\nto be the one on the table, but could not say so on oath; he never let\r\nany one touch it; and she never looked at such horrid murderous things.\r\nAnd some remarks highly adverse to the volunteer movement were cut\r\nshort.\r\n\r\nWilliam Andrews, groom, had been called by Anne Ellis, had seen the\r\nwound, and the blood on the desk, and had gone to fetch a surgeon and\r\nthe police from Whitford.  On his return, saw the rifle leaning against\r\nthe shutter; believed it to be Mr. Ward\'s rifle.\r\n\r\nCharles Rankin, surgeon, had been called in to see Mr. Axworthy, and\r\narrived at seven o\'clock A. M.  Found him dead, from a fracture of the\r\nskull over the left temple, he should imagine, from a blow from a heavy\r\nblunt instrument, such as the stock of a gun.  Death must have been\r\ninstantaneous, and had probably taken place seven or eight hours before\r\nhe was called in.  The marks upon the rifle before him were probably\r\nblood; but he could not say so upon oath, till he had subjected them to\r\nmicroscopic examination.  The hair was human, and corresponded with\r\nthat of the deceased.\r\n\r\nSamuel Axworthy had slept at the Three Goblets, in consequence of\r\nfinding himself too late for admission at home.  He had been wakened at\r\nhalf-past five, and found all as had been stated by the previous\r\nwitnesses; and he corroborated the housekeeper\'s account of his uncle\'s\r\nhabits.  The rifle he believed to belong to his cousin, Leonard Ward.\r\nHe could not account for Leonard Ward\'s absence on that morning.  No\r\npermission, as far as he was aware, had been given him to leave home;\r\nand he had never known his uncle give him any commission at that hour.\r\n\r\nThe different policemen gave their narrations of the state of\r\nthings--the open window, the position of the boat, &c.  And the\r\nticket-clerk at the small Blewer Station stated that at about 12.15 at\r\nnight, Mr. Ward had walked in without baggage, and asked for a\r\nsecond-class ticket to London.\r\n\r\nLeonard here interposed an inquiry whether he had not said a day\r\nticket, and the clerk recollected that he had done so, and had spoken\r\nof returning by four o\'clock; but the train, being reckoned as\r\nbelonging to the previous day, no return tickets were issued for it,\r\nand he had therefore taken an ordinary one, and started by the mail\r\ntrain.\r\n\r\nThe London policeman, who had come down with Leonard, stated that, in\r\nconsequence of a telegraphic message, he had been at the Paddington\r\nStation at 6.30 that morning; had seen a young gentleman answering to\r\nthe description sent to him, asked if his name were Leonard Ward, and\r\nreceiving a reply in the affirmative, had informed him of the charge,\r\nand taken him into custody.  The bag that he placed on the table he had\r\nfound on the young man\'s person.\r\n\r\nEvery one was startled at this unexpected corroboration of the\r\nsuspicion.  It was a heavy-looking bag, of reddish canvas, marked with\r\na black circle, containing the letters F. A. Gold; the neck tied with a\r\nstring; the contents were sovereigns, and a note or two.\r\n\r\nDr. May looked piteously, despairingly, at Leonard; but the brow was\r\nstill open and unclouded, the eye glanced back reassurance and\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nThe policeman added that he had cautioned the young man to take care\r\nwhat he said, but that he had declared at once that his uncle had sent\r\nhim to lodge the sum in Drummond\'s Bank, and that he would show a\r\nreceipt for it on his return.\r\n\r\nThe coroner then proceeded to examine Leonard, but still as a witness.\r\nEdward Anderson spoke to him in an undertone, advising him to be\r\ncautious, and not commit himself, but Leonard, rather impatiently\r\nthanking him, shook him off, and spoke with freedom and openness.\r\n\r\n\'I have nothing to keep back,\' he said.  \'Of course I know nothing of\r\nthis frightful murder, nor what villain could have got hold of the\r\nrifle, which, I am sorry to say, is really mine.  Last evening I used\r\nit at drill and practice on Blewer Heath, and came home when it grew\r\ndusk, getting in at about half-past nine.  I was then told by Mrs.\r\nGiles that my uncle wished to speak to me, and was displeased at my\r\nstaying out so late.  I went into his room as I was, and put my rifle\r\ndown in a corner by the window, when he desired me to sit down and\r\nlisten to him.  He then told me that he wished to send me to town by\r\nthe mail train, to take some cash to Drummond\'s Bank, and to return by\r\nto-day\'s four o\'clock train.  He said he had reasons for wishing no one\r\nto be aware of his opening an account there, and he undertook to\r\nexplain my absence.  He took the sum from the private drawer of his\r\ndesk, and made me count it before him, L124 12s. in sovereigns and\r\nbank-notes.  The odd money he gave me for my expenses, the rest I put\r\nin the bag that I fetched out of the office.  He could not hold a pen,\r\nand could therefore give me no letter to Messrs. Drummond, but he made\r\nme write a receipt for the amount in his memorandum book.  I wished him\r\ngood night, and left him still sitting in his easy-chair, with the\r\nwindow open and the blind down. I found that I had forgotten my rifle,\r\nbut I did not go back for it, because he disliked the disturbance of\r\nopening and shutting doors.  While I was changing my dress, I saw from\r\nthe window that some one was still about in the court, and knowing that\r\nmy uncle wished me to avoid notice, I thought it best to let myself out\r\nby the passage window, as I had sometimes done in early mornings to\r\nbathe or fish, and go across the fields to Blewer Station.  I got down\r\ninto the garden, crossed in the punt, and went slowly by Barnard\'s\r\nhatch; I believe I stopped a good many times, as it was too soon, and a\r\nbeautiful moonlight night, but I came to Blewer soon after twelve, and\r\ntook my ticket.  At Paddington I met this terrible news.\'\r\n\r\nAs the boy spoke, his bright eyes turned from one listener to another,\r\nas though expecting to read satisfaction on their faces; but as doubt\r\nand disbelief clouded all, his looks became almost constantly directed\r\nto Dr. May, and his voice unconsciously passed from a sound of\r\njustification to one of pleading.  When he ceased, he glanced round as\r\nif feeling his innocence established.\r\n\r\n\'You gave a receipt, Mr. Ward,\' said the coroner.  \'Will you tell us\r\nwhere it is likely to be?\'\r\n\r\n\'It must be either on or in my uncle\'s desk, or in his pocket.  Will\r\nsome one look for it?  I wrote it in his memorandum book--a curious old\r\nblack shagreen book, with a silver clasp.  I left it open on the desk\r\nto dry.\'\r\n\r\nA policeman went to search for it; and the coroner asked what the entry\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\n\'July 5th, 1860.  Received, L120.  L. A. Ward,\'--was the answer. \'You\r\nwill find it about the middle of the book, or rather past it.\'\r\n\r\n\'At what time did this take place?\'\r\n\r\n\'It must have been towards ten.  I cannot tell exactly, but it was\r\nlater than half-past nine when I came in, and he was a good while\r\nbringing out the money.\'\r\n\r\nThe policeman returned, saying he could not find the book; and Leonard\r\nbegging to show where he had left it, the coroner and jury accompanied\r\nhim to the room.  At the sight of the red stain on the desk, a\r\nshuddering came over the boy, and a whiteness on his heated brow, nor\r\ncould he at once recover himself so as to proceed with the search,\r\nwhich was still in vain; though with a voice lowered by the sickness of\r\nhorror, he pointed out the place where he had laid it, and the pen he\r\nhad used; and desk, table, drawer, and the dead man\'s dress were\r\ncarefully examined.\r\n\r\n\'You must know it, Sam,\' said Leonard.  \'Don\'t you remember his putting\r\nin the cheque--old Bilson\'s cheque for his year\'s rent--twenty-five\r\npounds?  I brought it in, and he put it away one day last week.  You\r\nwere sitting there.\'\r\n\r\nSam stammered something of \'Yes, he did recollect something of it.\'\r\n\r\nInquiries were made of the other persons concerned with Mr. Axworthy.\r\nHardy thought his master used such a book, but had never seen it near;\r\nMrs. Giles altogether disbelieved its existence; and Sam could not be\r\npositive--his uncle never allowed any one to touch his private\r\nmemorandums.\r\n\r\nAs, with deepened anxiety, Dr. May returned to the dining-room, he\r\ncaught a glimpse of Henry Ward\'s desponding face, but received a sign\r\nnot to disclose his presence.  Edward Anderson wrote, and considered;\r\nand the coroner, looking at his notes again, recurred to Leonard\'s\r\nstatement that he had seen some one in the yard.\r\n\r\n\'I thought it was one of the men waiting to take my cousin Axworthy\'s\r\nhorse.  I did not know whether he had ridden or gone by train; and I\r\nsupposed that some one would be looking out for him.\'\r\n\r\nQuestions were asked whether any of the servants had been in the yard,\r\nbut it was denied by all; and on a more particular description of the\r\nperson being demanded, Leonard replied that the figure had been in the\r\ndark shade of the stables, and that he only knew that it was a young\r\nman--whether a stranger or not he did not know; he supposed now that it\r\nmust have been the--the murderer, but at the time he had thought it one\r\nof the stable-men; and as his uncle had particularly wished that his\r\njourney should be a secret, the sight had only made him hasten to put\r\nout his light, and depart unseen.  It was most unfortunate that he had\r\ndone so.\r\n\r\nOthers ironically whispered, \'Most unfortunate.\'\r\n\r\nThe coroner asked Mr. Anderson whether he had anything to ask or\r\nobserve, and on his reply in the negative, proceeded to sum up the\r\nevidence for the consideration of the jury.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if it were only here that Leonard perceived the real gist\r\nof the evidence.  His brow grew hotter, his eyes indignant, his hands\r\nclenched, as if he with difficulty restrained himself from breaking in\r\non the coroner\'s speech; and when at length the question was put to the\r\njury, he stood, the colour fading from his cheek, his eyes set and\r\nglassy, his lip fallen, the dew breaking out on his brow, every limb as\r\nit were petrified by the shock of what was thus first fully revealed to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSo he stood, while the jury deliberated in low gruff sorrowful murmurs,\r\nand after a few minutes, turned round to announce with much sadness\r\nthat they could do no otherwise than return a verdict of wilful murder\r\nagainst Leonard Ward.\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Leonard Ward,\' said the coroner, a gentleman who had well known\r\nhis father, and who spoke with scarcely concealed emotion, \'it becomes\r\nmy painful duty to commit you to Whitford Gaol for trial at the next\r\nassizes.\'\r\n\r\nDr. May eagerly offered bail, rather as the readiest form of kindness\r\nthan in the hope of its acceptance, and it was of course refused; but\r\nhe made his way to the prisoner, and wrung his chill hand with all his\r\nmight.  The pressure seemed to waken the poor lad from his frozen\r\nrigidity; the warmth came flowing back into his fingers as his friend\r\nheld them; he raised his head, shut and re-opened his eyes, and pushed\r\nback his hair, as though trying to shake himself loose from a too\r\nhorrible dream.  His face softened and quivered as he met the Doctor\'s\r\nkind eyes; but bracing himself again, he looked up, answered the\r\ncoroner\'s question--that his Christian name was Leonard Axworthy, his\r\nage within a few weeks of eighteen; and asked permission to fetch what\r\nhe should want from his room.\r\n\r\nThe policeman, in whose charge he was, consented both to this, and to\r\nDr. May being there alone with him for a short time.\r\n\r\nThen it was that the boy relaxed the strain on his features, and said\r\nin a low and strangled voice, \'O, Dr. May, if you had only let me die\r\nwith them last year!\'\r\n\r\n\'It was not I who saved you.  He who sent that ordeal, will bring you\r\nthrough--this,\' said Dr. May, with a great sob in his throat that\r\nbelied his words of cheer.\r\n\r\n\'I thank Him at least for having taken her,\' said Leonard, resting his\r\nhead on the mantel-shelf beneath his mother\'s picture, while his little\r\ndog sat at his foot, looking up at him, cowed and wistful.\r\n\r\nDr. May strove for words of comfort, but broke utterly down; and could\r\nonly cover his face with his hands, and struggle with his emotion,\r\nunable to utter a word.\r\n\r\nYet perhaps none would have been so comforting as his genuine sympathy,\r\nalthough it was in a voice of extreme distress that Leonard exclaimed,\r\n\'Dr. May, Dr. May, pray don\'t! you ought not to grieve for me!\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m a fool,\' said Dr. May, after some space, fighting hard with\r\nhimself.  \'Nonsense! we shall see you out of this!  We have only to\r\nkeep up a good heart, and we shall see it explained.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know; I can\'t understand,\' said Leonard, passing his hand over\r\nhis weary forehead.  \'Why could they not believe when I told them just\r\nhow it was?\'\r\n\r\nAt that moment the policeman opened the door, saying, \'Here, sir;\' and\r\nHenry hurried in, pale and breathless, not looking in his brother\'s\r\nface, as he spoke fast and low.\r\n\r\n\'Ned Anderson says there\'s nothing at all to be made of this defence of\r\nyours; it is of no use to try it.  The only thing is to own that he\r\nfound fault with you, and in one of your rages--you know--\'\r\n\r\n\'You too, Henry!\' said Leonard, in dejected reproach.\r\n\r\n\'Why--why, it is impossible it could have been otherwise--open window,\r\nabsconding, and all.  We all know you never meant it; but your story\r\nwon\'t stand; and the only chance, Anderson says, is to go in for\r\nmanslaughter.  If you could only tell anything that would give him a\r\nclue to pick up evidence while the people are on the spot.\'\r\n\r\nLeonard\'s face was convulsed for a moment while his brother was\r\nspeaking; but he recovered calmness of voice, as he mournfully\r\nanswered, \'I have no right to wonder at your suspicion of me.\'\r\n\r\nHenry for the first time really looked at him, and instinctively\r\nfaltered, \'I beg your pardon.\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed,\' said Leonard, with the same subdued manner, \'I cannot believe\r\nthat any provocation could make me strike a person like that old man;\r\nand here there was none at all.  Except that he was vexed at first at\r\nmy being late, he had never been so near kindness.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then is this extraordinary story the truth?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why should I not tell the truth?\' was the answer, too mournful for\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\nHenry again cast down his eyes, Leonard moved about making\r\npreparations, Dr. May leant against the wall--all too much oppressed\r\nfor speech; till, as Leonard stooped, poor little Mab, thrusting her\r\nblack head into his hand, drew from him the words, \'My doggie, what is\r\nto become of you?\'\r\n\r\nA sort of hoarse explosion of \'Ave\' from Henry was simultaneous with\r\nthe Doctor\'s \'I tried to get her home with me in the morning, but she\r\nwaited your orders.\'\r\n\r\n\'Miss May would not have her now.  After all, prussic acid would be the\r\ntruest mercy\' said Leonard, holding the little creature up to his face,\r\nand laying his cheek against her silken coat with almost passionate\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n\'Not while there are those who trust your word, Leonard; as Ethel said\r\nthis morning.\'\r\n\r\nHe raised the face which he had hidden against the dog, and looked\r\nearnestly at the Doctor as if hardly venturing to understand him; then\r\na ray of real gladness and comfort darted into his eyes, which so\r\nenlivened Dr. May, that he was able to say cheerfully, \'We will take\r\ngood care of her till you come for her.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then, Henry,\' said Leonard, \'it is not unkindness, nor that I remember\r\nthings, but indeed I think it will be better for you all, since Dr. May\r\nis so--so--\' The word kind was so inadequate, that it stuck in his\r\nthroat.  \'Take this to Ave,\' putting his mother\'s likeness in his hand,\r\n\'and tell her I will write,\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor Ave!\'\r\n\r\nLeonard imploringly shook his head; the mention of his sister shook him\r\nmore than he could bear; and he asked the time.\r\n\r\n\'Nearly six.\'\r\n\r\n\'Only six!  What an endless day!  There, I am ready.  There is no use\r\nin delaying.  I suppose I must show what I am taking with me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wait,\' said his brother.  \'Cannot you say anything to put us on the\r\ntrack of the man in the yard?\'\r\n\r\n\'I did not see him plain.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'ve no notion?\' said Henry, with a movement of annoyance.\r\n\r\n\'No.  I only looked for a moment; for I was much more anxious to get\r\noff quietly, than to make any one out.  If I had only waited ten\r\nminutes, it might have been the saving of his life, but my commission\r\nwas so like fun, and so important too, that I thought of nothing else.\r\nCan it be not twenty-four hours ago?\'\r\n\r\n\'And why don\'t you explain why he sent you?\'\r\n\r\n\'I cannot say it so certainly as to be of the slightest use,\' said\r\nLeonard.\r\n\r\n\'He never expressed it either; and I have no right to talk of my\r\nsuspicions.\'\r\n\r\n\'Eh! was it to put it out of Sam\'s way?\'\r\n\r\n\'So I suppose.  Sam used to get all he chose out of the poor old man;\r\nand I believe he thought this the only chance of keeping anything for\r\nhimself, but he never told me so.  Stay!  Bilson\'s cheque might be\r\ntracked.  I took it myself, and gave the receipt; you will find it\r\nentered in the books--paid on either the twenty-third or fourth.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then there\'s something to do, at any rate,\' cried Henry, invigorated.\r\n\'Anderson shall hunt out the balance and Sam\'s draughts on it.  I\'ll\r\nspare no expense, Leonard, if it is to my last farthing; and you shall\r\nhave the best counsel that can be retained.\'\r\n\r\nLeonard signed thanks with some heartiness, and was going to the door,\r\nwhen Henry detained him.  \'Tell me, Leonard, have you no suspicion?\'\r\n\r\n\'It must have been the person I saw in the court, and, like a fool, did\r\nnot watch.  The window was open, and he could have easily got in and\r\ncome out.  Can\'t they see that if it had been me, I should have made\r\noff at once that way?\'\r\n\r\n\'If you could only tell what the fellow was like!\'\r\n\r\n\'I told you he was in the dark,\' said Leonard, and without giving time\r\nfor more, he called in the man outside, showed the clothes and, books\r\nhe had selected, put them into his bag, and declared himself ready,\r\ngiving his hand to the Doctor, who drew him near and kissed his brow,\r\nas if he had been Harry setting forth on a voyage.\r\n\r\n\'Good-bye, my dear fellow; God bless you; I\'ll soon come to see you.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I,\' said Henry, \'will bring Bramshaw to see what is to be done.\'\r\n\r\nLeonard wrung his brother\'s hand, murmuring something of love to his\r\nsisters; then put Mab into Dr. May\'s arms, with injunctions that the\r\nlittle creature understood and obeyed, for though trembling and whining\r\nunder her breath, she was not resisting.\r\n\r\nIt might be to shorten her distress as well as his own that Leonard\r\npassed quickly down-stairs, and entered the carriage that was to take\r\nhim to the county gaol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n  Tears are not always fruitful; their hot drops\r\n    Sometimes but scorch the cheek and dim the eye;\r\n  Despairing murmurs over blackened hopes,\r\n    Not the meek spirit\'s calm and chastened cry.\r\n  Oh, better not to weep, than weep amiss!\r\n    For hard it is to learn to weep aright;\r\n  To weep wise tears, the tears that heal and bless,\r\n    The tears which their own bitterness requite.--H. BONAR\r\n\r\n\r\nTo one of the most tender-hearted of human beings had the office of\r\nconveying ill tidings been most often committed, and again Dr. May\r\nfound himself compelled to precede Henry Ward into the sister\'s\r\npresence, and to break to her the result of the inquest.\r\n\r\nHe was no believer in the efficacy of broken news, but he could not\r\nrefuse when Henry in his wretchedness entreated not to be the first in\r\nthe infliction of such agony; so he left the carriage outside, and\r\nwalked up to the door; and there stood Averil, with Ethel a few steps\r\nbehind her.  His presence was enough revelation.  Had things gone well,\r\nhe would not have been the forerunner; and Averil, meaning perhaps to\r\nspeak, gave a hoarse hysterical shriek, so frightful as to drive away\r\nother anxieties, and summon Henry in from his watch outside.\r\n\r\nAll day the poor girl had kept up an unnatural strain on her powers,\r\nvehemently talking of other things, and, with burning cheeks and\r\nshining eyes, moving incessantly from one employment to another; now\r\nher needle, now her pencil--roaming round the garden gathering flowers,\r\nor playing rattling polkas that half stunned Ethel in her intense\r\nlistening for tidings.  Ethel, who had relieved guard and sent Mary\r\nhome in the afternoon, had vainly striven to make Ave rest or take\r\nfood; the attempt had brought on such choking, that she could only\r\ndesist, and wait for the crisis.  The attack was worse than any\r\nordinary hysterics, almost amounting to convulsions; and all that could\r\nbe done was to prevent her from hurting herself, and try to believe Dr.\r\nMay\'s assurance that there was no real cause for alarm, and that the\r\nparoxysms would exhaust themselves.\r\n\r\nIn time they were spent, and Ave lay on her bed half torpid, feebly\r\nmoaning, but with an instinctive dread of being disturbed.  Henry\r\nanxiously watched over her, and Dr. May thought it best to leave the\r\nbrother and sister to one another.  Absolute quiet was best for her,\r\nand he had skill and tenderness enough to deal with her, and was\r\nevidently somewhat relieved by the necessity of waiting on her.  It was\r\nthe best means, perhaps, of uniting them, that they should be thus left\r\ntogether; and Dr. May would have taken home little pale frightened\r\nMinna, who had been very helpful all the time.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, please not, Dr. May,\' she said, earnestly.  \'Indeed I will not be\r\ntroublesome, and I can give Henry his tea, and carry Ave\'s cup. Please,\r\nHenry, don\'t send me:\' and she took hold of his hand, and laid it\r\nagainst her cheek.  He bent down over her, and fondled her; and there\r\nwere tears that he could not hide as he tried both to thank Dr. May,\r\nand tell her that she need not leave him.\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said Dr. May; \'it would be cruel to both of you.--Good-bye,\r\nlittle Minna; I never wanted to carry away a little comforter.\'\r\n\r\n\'I believe you are right, papa,\' said Ethel, as she went out with him\r\nto the carriage; \'but I long to stay, it is like doing something for\r\nthat boy.\'\r\n\r\n\'The best you did for him, poor dear boy! was the saying you trusted\r\nhis word.  The moment I told him that, he took comfort and energy.\'\r\n\r\nEthel\'s lips moved into a strange half smile, and she took Mab on her\r\nlap, and fondled her.  \'Yes,\' she said, \'I believe I stand for a good\r\ndeal in his imagination.  I was afraid he would have been wrecked upon\r\nthat horrid place; but, after all, this may be the saving of him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah! if that story of his would only be more vraisemblable.\'\r\n\r\nThere was only time briefly to narrate it before coming home, where the\r\nfirst person they met was Aubrey, exceeding pale, and in great\r\ndistress.  \'Papa, I must tell you,\' he said, drawing him into the\r\nstudy.  \'I have done terrible harm, I am afraid.\'  And he explained,\r\nthat in the morning, when Mrs. Pugh had come down full of inquiries and\r\nconjectures, and had spoken of the possibility of Leonard\'s having been\r\ndrowned while bathing, he had unguardedly answered that it could be no\r\nsuch thing; Leonard had always meant to run away, and by that very\r\nwindow, if the Axworthys grew too bad.\r\n\r\nPrudent Tom had silenced him at the time, but had since found that it\r\nhad got abroad that the evasion had long been meditated with Aubrey\'s\r\nprivity, and had been asked by one of the constabulary force if his\r\nbrother would not be an important witness.  Tom had replied that he\r\nknew nothing about it; but Aubrey was in great misery, furious with\r\nMrs. Pugh, and only wanting his father to set off at once to assure\r\nthem it was all nonsense.\r\n\r\n\'No, Aubrey, they neither would, nor ought to, take my word.\'\r\n\r\n\'Just hear, papa, and you would know the chaff it was.\'\r\n\r\n\'I cannot hear, Aubrey.  If we were to discuss it, we might give it an\r\nunconscious colouring.  You must calm your mind, and exactly recall\r\nwhat passed; but do not talk about it to me or to any one else.  You\r\nmust do nothing to impair the power of perfect truth and accuracy,\r\nwhich is a thing to be prayed for.  If any one--even the lawyer who may\r\nhave to get up the case against him--asks you about it, you must refuse\r\nto answer till the trial; and then--why, the issue is in the hands of\r\nHim that judgeth righteously.\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall never remember nor speak with his eyes on me, seeing me betray\r\nhim!\'\r\n\r\n\'You will be no worse off than I, my boy, for I see I am in for\r\nidentifying Hector\'s rifle; the Mill people can\'t swear to it, and my\r\ndoing it will save his brother something.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, it is not like me.  O! I wish I had stayed at Eton, even if I had\r\ndied of it!  Tom says it all comes of living with women that I can\'t\r\nkeep my mouth shut; and Leonard will be so hurt that I--\'\r\n\r\n\'Nay, any tolerable counsel will make a capital defence out of the mere\r\nfact of his rodomontading.  What, is that no comfort to you?\'\r\n\r\n\'What! to be the means of making a fool of him before all the\r\ncourt--seeing him hear our talk by the river-side sifted by those\r\nhorrid lawyers?\'\r\n\r\nThe Doctor looked even graver, and his eye fixed as on a thought far\r\naway, as the boy\'s grief brought to his mind the Great Assize, when all\r\nthat is spoken in the ear shall indeed be proclaimed on the house-tops.\r\n\r\nThere was something almost childish in this despair of Aubrey, for he\r\nhad not become alarmed for the result of the trial.  His misery was\r\nchiefly shame at his supposed treason to friendship, and failure in\r\nmanly reserve; and he could not hold up his head all the evening, but\r\nsilently devoted himself to Mab, endeavouring to make her at home, and\r\nmeeting with tolerable success.\r\n\r\nTom was no less devoted to Ella Ward.  It was he who had brought her\r\nhome, and he considered her therefore as his charge.  It was curious to\r\nsee the difference that a year had made between her and Minna. They had\r\nthe last summer been like one child, and had taken the stroke that had\r\norphaned them in the same childish manner; but whether the year from\r\neight to nine had been of especial growth to Minna, or whether there\r\nhad been a stimulus in her constant association with Averil, the\r\npresent sorrow fell on her as on one able to enter into it, think and\r\nfeel, and assume her sweet mission of comfort; whilst Ella, though\r\nneither hard nor insensible, was still child enough to close her mind\r\nto what she dreaded, and flee willingly from the pain and tedium of\r\naffliction.  She had willingly accepted \'Mr. Tom\'s\' invitation, and as\r\nwillingly responded to his attentions.  Gertrude did not like people in\r\nthe \'little girl\' stage, and the elder sisters had their hands and\r\nhearts full, and could only care for her in essentials; but Tom\r\nundertook her amusement, treated her to an exhibition of his\r\nmicroscope, and played at French billiards with her the rest of the\r\nevening, till she was carried off to bed in Mary\'s room, when he\r\npronounced her a very intelligent child.\r\n\r\n\'I think her a very unfeeling little thing,\' said Gertrude.  \'Very\r\nunbecoming behaviour under the circumstances.\'\r\n\r\n\'What would you think becoming behaviour?\' asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\'I won\'t encourage it,\' returned Daisy, with dignified decision, that\r\ngave her father his first approach to a laugh on that day; but nobody\r\nwas in spirits to desire Miss Daisy to define from what her important\r\nsanction was withdrawn.\r\n\r\nMary gave up her Sunday-school class to see how Averil was, and found\r\nHenry much perturbed.  He had seen her fast asleep at night, and in the\r\nmorning Minna had carried up her breakfast, and he was about to follow\r\nit, as soon as his own was finished, when he found that she had slipped\r\nout of the house, leaving a message that she was gone to practise on\r\nthe harmonium.\r\n\r\nHe was of the mind that none of the family could or ought to be seen at\r\nchurch; and though Mary could not agree with him, she willingly\r\nconsented to go to the chapel and try what she could do with his\r\nsister.  She met Mrs. Ledwich on the way, coming to inquire and see\r\nwhether she or dear Matilda could do anything for the \'sweet sufferer.\'\r\nEven Mary could not help thinking that this was not the epithet most\r\nbefitting poor Ave; and perhaps Mrs. Ledwich\'s companionship made her\r\nthe less regret that Ave had locked herself in, so that there was no\r\nmaking her hear, though the solemn chants, played with great fervour,\r\nreached them as they waited in the porch. They had their own seats in\r\nthe Minster, and therefore could not wait till the sexton should come\r\nto open the church.\r\n\r\nThere was no time for another visit till after the second service, and\r\nthen Dr. May and Mary, going to Bankside, found that instead of\r\nreturning home, Ave had again locked herself up between the services,\r\nand that Minna, who had ventured on a mission of recall, had come home\r\ncrying heartily both at the dreary disappointment of knocking in vain,\r\nand at the grand mournful sounds of funeral marches that had fallen on\r\nher ear.  Every one who had been at the chapel that day was speaking of\r\nthe wonderful music, the force and the melody of the voluntary at the\r\ndismissal of the congregation; no one had believed that such power\r\nresided in the harmonium.  Mr. Scudamour had spoken to Miss Ward most\r\nkindly both before and after evening service, but his attempt to take\r\nher home had been unavailing; she had answered that she was going\r\npresently, and he was obliged to leave her.\r\n\r\nEvening was coming on, and she had not come, so the other keys were\r\nfetched from the sexton\'s, and Dr. May and his daughter set off to\r\nstorm her fortress.  Like Minna, the Doctor was almost overpowered by\r\nthe wonderful plaintive sweetness of the notes that were floating\r\nthrough the atmosphere, like a wailing voice of supplication.  They had\r\nalmost unnerved him, as he waited while Mary unlocked the door.\r\n\r\nThe sound of its opening hushed the music; Averil turned her head, and\r\nrecognizing them, came to them, very pale, and with sunken eyes. \'You\r\nare coming home, dear Ave,\' said Mary; and she made no resistance or\r\nobjection, only saying, \'Yes.  It has been so nice here!\'\r\n\r\n\'You must come now, though,\' said the Doctor.  \'Your brother is very\r\nmuch grieved at your leaving him.\'\r\n\r\n\'I did not mean to be unkind to him,\' said Averil, in a low subdued\r\nvoice; \'he was very good to me last night.  Only--this is peace--this,\'\r\npointing to her instrument, \'is such a soothing friend.  And surely\r\nthis is the place to wait in!\'\r\n\r\n\'The place to wait in indeed, my poor child, if you are not increasing\r\nthe distress of others by staying here.  Besides, you must not exhaust\r\nyourself, or how are you to go and cheer Leonard!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! there is no fear but that I shall go to-morrow,\' said Averil; \'I\r\nmean to do it!\' the last words being spoken in a resolute tone, unlike\r\nthe weariness of her former replies.\r\n\r\nAnd with this purpose before her, she consented to be taken back by\r\nMary to rest on the sofa, and even to try to eat and drink.  Her\r\nbrother and sister hung over her, and waited on her with a tender\r\nassiduous attention that showed how they had missed her all day; and\r\nshe received their kindness gratefully, as far as her broken wearied\r\nstate permitted.\r\n\r\nSeveral inquiries had come throughout the day from the neighbours; and\r\nwhile Mary was still with Ave, a message was brought in to ask whether\r\nMiss Ward would like to see Mrs. Pugh.\r\n\r\n\'Oh no, no, thank her, but indeed I cannot,\' said Averil, shivering\r\nuncontrollably as she lay.\r\n\r\nMary felt herself blushing, in the wonder what would be kindest to do,\r\nand her dread of seeing Henry\'s face.  She was sure that he too shrank,\r\nand she ventured to ask, \'Shall I go and speak to her?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, do, do,\' said Averil, shuddering with eagerness.  \'Thank you, Miss\r\nMary,\' said Henry slowly.  \'She is most kind--but--under the\r\ncircumstances--\'\r\n\r\nMary went, finding that he only hesitated.  She had little opportunity\r\nfor saying anything; Mrs. Pugh was full of interest and eagerness, and\r\npoured out her sympathy and perfect understanding of dear Averil\'s\r\nfeelings; and in the midst Henry came out of the room, with a stronger\r\nversion of their gratitude, but in terrible confusion.  Mary would fain\r\nhave retreated, but could not, and was witness to the lady\'s urgent\r\nentreaties to take Minna home, and Henry\'s thankfulness; but he\r\nfeared--and retreated to ask the opinion of his sisters, while Mrs.\r\nPugh told Mary that it was so very bad for the poor child to remain,\r\nand begged to have Ella if she were a moment\'s inconvenience to the May\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nHenry came back with repeated thanks, but Minna could not bear to leave\r\nhome; and in fact, he owned, with a half smile that gave sweetness to\r\nhis face, she was too great a comfort to be parted with. So Mrs. Pugh\r\ndeparted, with doubled and trebled offers of service, and entreaties to\r\nbe sent for at any hour of the day or night when she could be of use to\r\nAveril.\r\n\r\nMary could not but be pleased with her, officious as she was.  It\r\nlooked as if she had more genuine feeling for Henry than had been\r\nsuspected, and the kindness was certain, though some of it might be the\r\nbusy activity of a not very delicate nature, eager for the importance\r\nconferred by intimacy with the subjects of a great calamity.  Probably\r\nshe would have been gratified by the eclat of being the beloved of the\r\nbrother of the youth whose name was in every mouth, and her real\r\ngoodness and benevolent heart would have committed her affections and\r\ninterest beyond recall to the Ward family, had Averil leant upon her,\r\nor had Henry exerted himself to take advantage of her advances.\r\n\r\nBut Henry\'s attachment had probably not been love, for it seemed\r\nutterly crushed out of him by his shame and despair.  Everything\r\nconnected with his past life was hateful to him; he declared that he\r\ncould never show his face at Stoneborough again, let the result be what\r\nit might--that he could never visit another patient, and that he should\r\nchange his name and leave the country, beginning on that very Sunday\r\nafternoon to write a letter to his principal rival to negotiate the\r\nsale of his practice.\r\n\r\nIn fact, his first impression had returned on him, and though he never\r\ndisclaimed belief in Leonard\'s statement, the entire failure of all\r\nconfirmation convinced him that the blow had been struck by his brother\r\nin sudden anger, and that, defend him as he might and would, the stain\r\nwas on his house, and the guilt would be brought home.\r\n\r\nResolved, however, to do his utmost, he went with Mr. Bramshaw for a\r\nconsultation with Leonard on the Monday.  Averil could not go.  She\r\nrose and dressed, and remained resolute till nearly the last minute,\r\nwhen her feverish faint giddiness overpowered her, and she was forced\r\nto submit to lie on the sofa, under Minna\'s care; and there she lay,\r\nrestless and wretched, till wise little Minna sent a message up to the\r\nHigh Street, which brought down Mary and Dr. Spencer.  They found her\r\nin a state of nervous fever, that sentenced her to her bed, where Mary\r\ndeposited her and watched over her, till her brother\'s return, more\r\ndesponding than ever.\r\n\r\nDr. May, with all Henry\'s patients on his hands as well as his own, had\r\nbeen forced to devote this entire day to his profession; but on the\r\nnext, leaving Henry to watch over Averil, who continued very feeble and\r\nfeverish, he went to Whitford, almost infected by Henry\'s forebodings\r\nand Mr. Bramshaw\'s misgivings.  \'It is a bad case,\' the attorney had\r\nsaid to him, confidentially.  \'But that there is always a great\r\nreluctance to convict upon circumstantial evidence, I should have very\r\nlittle hope, that story of his is so utterly impracticable; and yet he\r\nlooks so innocent and earnest all the time, and sticks to it so\r\nconsistently, that I don\'t know what to make of it.  I can\'t do\r\nanything with him, nor can his brother either; but perhaps you might\r\nmake him understand that we could bring him clear off for\r\nmanslaughter--youth, and character and all.  I should not doubt of a\r\nverdict for a moment!  It is awkward about the money, but the alarm\r\nwould be considered in the sentence.\'\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t attend to his account of the person he saw in the\r\ncourt-yard?\'\r\n\r\n\'The less said about that the better,\' returned Mr. Bramshaw.  \'It\r\nwould only go for an awkward attempt to shift off the suspicion, unless\r\nhe would give any description; and that he can\'t, or won\'t do. Or even\r\nif he did, the case would be all the stronger against his\r\nstory--setting off, and leaving a stranger to maraud about the place.\r\nNo, Dr. May; the only thing for it is to persuade the lad to own to\r\nhaving struck the old man in a passion; every one knows old Axworthy\r\ncould be intolerably abusive, and the boy always was passionate. Don\'t\r\nyou remember his flying out at Mr. Rivers\'s, the night of the party,\r\nand that affair which was the means of his going to the mill at all?  I\r\ndon\'t mind saying so to you in confidence, because I know you won\'t\r\nrepeat it, and I see his brother thinks so too; but nothing is likely\r\nto turn out so well for him as that line of defence; as things stand\r\nnow, the present one is good for nothing.\'\r\n\r\nDr. May was almost as much grieved at the notion of the youth\'s\r\npersistence in denying such a crime, as at the danger in which it\r\ninvolved him, and felt that if he were to be brought to confession, it\r\nshould be from repentance, not expediency.\r\n\r\nIn this mood he drove to Whitford Gaol, made application at the gates,\r\nand was conducted up the stairs to the cell.\r\n\r\nThe three days of nearly entire solitude and of awful expectation had\r\ntold like double the number of years; and there was a stamp of grave\r\nearnest collectedness on the young brow, and a calm resolution of\r\naspect and movement, free from all excitement or embarrassment, as\r\nLeonard Ward stood up with a warm grateful greeting, so full of\r\ningenuous reliance, that every doubt vanished at the same moment.\r\n\r\nHis first question was for Averil; and Dr. May made the best of her\r\nstate.  \'She slept a little more last night, and her pulse is lower\r\nthis morning; but we keep her in bed, half to hinder her from trying to\r\ncome here before she is fit.  I believe this ailment is the best thing\r\nfor her and Henry both,\' added the Doctor, seeing how much pain his\r\nwords were giving.  \'Henry is a very good nurse; it occupies him, and\r\nit is good for her to feel his kindness!  Then Minna has come out in\r\nthe prettiest way: she never fails in some sweet little tender word or\r\ncaress just when it is wanted.\'\r\n\r\nLeonard tried to smile, but only succeeded in keeping back a sob; and\r\nthe Doctor discharged his memory of the messages of love of which he\r\nhad been the depositary.  Leonard recovered his composure during these,\r\nand was able to return a smile on hearing of Ella\'s conquest of Tom, of\r\ntheir Bible prints on Sunday, and their unwearied French billiards in\r\nthe week.  Then he asked after little Mab.\r\n\r\n\'She is all a dog should be,\' said Dr. May.  \'Aubrey is her chief\r\nfriend, except when she is lying at her ease on Ethel\'s dress.\'\r\n\r\nThe old test of dog-love perhaps occurred to Leonard, for his lips\r\ntrembled, and his eyes were dewy, even while they beamed with gladness.\r\n\r\n\'She is a great comfort to Aubrey,\' the Doctor added.  \'I must beg you\r\nto send that poor fellow your forgiveness, for he is exceedingly\r\nunhappy about something he repeated in the first unguarded moment.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Bramshaw told me,\' said Leonard, with brow contracted.\r\n\r\n\'I cannot believe,\' said Dr. May, \'that it can do you any real harm. I\r\ndo not think the prosecution ought to take notice of it; but if they\r\ndo, it will be easy to sift it, and make it tell rather in your favour.\'\r\n\r\n\'Maybe so,\' said Leonard, still coldly.\r\n\r\n\'Then you will cheer him with some kind message?\'\r\n\r\n\'To be sure.  It is the time for me to be forgiving every one,\' he\r\nanswered, with a long tightly-drawn breath.\r\n\r\nMuch distressed, the Doctor paused, in uncertainty whether Leonard were\r\nactuated by dread of the disclosure or resentment at the breach of\r\nconfidence; but ere he spoke, the struggle had been fought out, and a\r\nsweet sad face was turned round to him, with the words, \'Poor old\r\nAubrey!  Tell him not to mind.  There will be worse to be told out than\r\nour romancings together, and he will feel it more than I shall!  Don\'t\r\nlet him vex himself.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you,\' said the father, warmly.  \'I call that pardon.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not that there is anything to forgive,\' said Leonard, \'only it is odd\r\nthat one cares for it more than--No, no, don\'t tell him that, but that\r\nI know it does not signify.  It must not come between us, if this is to\r\nbe the end; and it will make no difference.  Nothing can do that but\r\nthe finding my receipt.  I see that book night and day before my eyes,\r\nwith the very blot that I made in the top of my L.\'\r\n\r\n\'You know they are searching the garden and fields, and advertising a\r\nreward, in case of its having been thrown away when rifled, or found to\r\ncontain no valuables.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes!\' and he rested on the word as though much lay behind.\r\n\r\n\'Do you think it contained anything worth keeping?\'\r\n\r\n\'Only by one person.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ha!\' said the Doctor, with a start.\r\n\r\nInstead of answering, Leonard leant down on the narrow bed on which he\r\nwas seated, and shut in his face between his hands.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor waited, guessed, and grew impatient.  \'You don\'t mean that\r\nfellow, Sam?  Do you think he has it?  I should like to throttle him,\r\nas sure as my name\'s Dick May!\' (this in soliloquy between his teeth).\r\n\'Speak up, Leonard, if you have any suspicion.\'\r\n\r\nThe lad lifted himself with grave resolution that gave him dignity.\r\n\'Dr. May,\' he said, \'I know that what I say is safe with you, and it\r\nseems disrespectful to ask your word and honour beforehand, but I think\r\nit will be better for us both if you will give them not to make use of\r\nwhat I tell you.  It weighs on me so, that I shall be saying it to the\r\nwrong person, unless I have it out with you.  You promise me?\'\r\n\r\n\'To make no use of it without your consent,\' repeated the Doctor, with\r\nrising hope, \'but this is no case for scruples--too much is at stake.\'\r\n\r\n\'You need not tell me that,\' Leonard replied, with a shudder; \'but I\r\nhave no proof.  I have thought again and again and again, but can find\r\nno possible witness.  He was always cautious, and drink made him\r\nsavage, but not noisy.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then you believe--\'  The silence told the rest.\r\n\r\n\'If I did not see how easy people find it to believe the same of me on\r\nthe mere evidence of circumstances, I should have no doubt,\' said\r\nLeonard, deliberately.\r\n\r\n\'Then it was he that you saw in the yard?\'\r\n\r\n\'Remember, all I saw was that a man was there.  I concluded it was\r\nAndrews, waiting to take the horse; and as he is a great hanger-on of\r\nSam, I wished to avoid him, and not keep my candle alight to attract\r\nhis attention.  That was the whole reason of my getting out of window,\r\nand starting so soon; as unlucky a thing as I could have done.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are sure it was not Andrews?\'\r\n\r\n\'Now I am.  You see, Sam had sent home his horse from the station,\r\nthough I did not know it; and, if you remember, Andrews was shown to\r\nhave been at his father\'s long before.  If he had been the man, he\r\ncould speak to the time my light was put out.\'\r\n\r\n\'The putting out of your light must have been the signal for the deed\r\nto be done.\'\r\n\r\n\'My poor uncle!  Well might he stare round as if he thought the walls\r\nwould betray him, and start at every chinking of that unhappy gold in\r\nhis helpless hands!  If we had only known who was near--perhaps behind\r\nthe blinds--\' and Leonard gasped.\r\n\r\n\'But this secrecy, Leonard, I cannot understand it.  Do you mean that\r\nthe poor old man durst not do what he would with his own?\'\r\n\r\n\'Just so.  Whenever Sam knew that he had a sum of money, he laid hands\r\non it.  Nothing was safe from him that Mr. Axworthy had in the Whitford\r\nBank.\'\r\n\r\n\'That can be proved from the accounts?\'\r\n\r\n\'You recollect the little parlour between the office and my uncle\'s\r\nsitting-room?  There I used to sit in the evening, and to feel, rather\r\nthan hear, the way Sam used to bully the poor old man.  Once--a\r\nfortnight ago, just after that talk with Aubrey--I knew he had been\r\ndrinking, and watched, and came in upon them when there was no bearing\r\nit any longer.  I was sworn at for my pains, and almost kicked out\r\nagain; but after that Mr. Axworthy made me sit in the room, as if I\r\nwere a protection; and I made up my mind to bear it as long as he\r\nlived.\'\r\n\r\n\'Surely the servants would bear witness to this state of things?\'\r\n\r\n\'I think not.  Their rooms are too far off for overhearing, and my\r\nuncle saw as little of them as possible.  Mrs. Giles was Sam\'s nurse,\r\nand cares for him more than any other creature; she would not say a\r\nword against him even if she knew anything; and my uncle would never\r\nhave complained.  He was fond of Sam to the last, proud of his\r\nsteeple-chases and his cleverness, and desperately afraid of him; in a\r\nsort of bondage, entirely past daring to speak.\'\r\n\r\n\'I know,\' said Dr. May, remembering how his own Tom had been fettered\r\nand tongue-tied by that same tyrant in boyhood.  \'But he spoke to you?\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said Leonard.  \'After that scene much was implied between us, but\r\nnothing mentioned.  I cannot even tell whether he trusted me, or only\r\nmade me serve as a protector.  I believe that row was about this money,\r\nwhich he had got together in secret, and that Sam suspected, and wanted\r\nto extort; but it was exactly as I said at the inquest, he gave no\r\nreason for sending me up to town with it.  He knew that I knew why, and\r\nso said no more than that it was to be private.  It was pitiful to see\r\nthat man, so fierce and bold as they say he once was, trembling as if\r\ndoing something by stealth, and the great hard knotty hands so crumpled\r\nand shaky, that he had to leave all to me.  And that they should fancy\r\nI could go and hurt him!\' said Leonard, stretching his broad chest and\r\nshoulders in conscious strength.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, considering who it was, I do not wonder that you feel the\r\npassion-theory as insulting as the accusation.\'\r\n\r\n\'I ought not,\' said Leonard, reddening.  \'Every one knows what my\r\ntemper can do.  I do not think that a poor old feeble man like that\r\ncould have provoked me to be so cowardly, but I see it is no wonder\r\nthey think so.  Only they might suppose I would not have been a robber,\r\nand go on lying now, when they take good care to tell me that it is\r\nruinous!\'\r\n\r\n\'It is an intolerable shame that they can look you in the face and\r\nimagine it for a moment,\' said the Doctor, with all his native warmth.\r\n\r\n\'After all,\' said Leonard, recalled by his sympathy, \'it is my own\r\nfault from beginning to end that I am in this case.  I see now that it\r\nwas only God\'s mercy that prevented my brother\'s blood being on me, and\r\nit was my unrepenting obstinacy that brought me to the mill; so there\r\nwill be no real injustice in my dying, and I expect nothing else.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hush, Leonard, depend upon it, while there is Justice in Heaven, the\r\ntrue criminal cannot go free,\' cried the Doctor, much agitated.\r\n\r\nLeonard shook his head.\r\n\r\n\'Boyish hastiness is not murder,\' added the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\'So I thought.  But it might have been, and I never repented.  I\r\nbrought all this on myself; and while I cannot feel guiltless in God\'s\r\nsight, I cannot expect it to turn out well.\'\r\n\r\n\'Turn out well,\' repeated the Doctor.  \'We want Ethel to tell us that\r\nthis very repentance and owning of the sin, is turning out well--better\r\nthan going on in it.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can see that,\' said Leonard.  \'I do hope that if--if I can take this\r\npatiently, it may show I am sorry for the real thing--and I may be\r\nforgiven.  Oh! I am glad prisoners are not cut off from church.\'\r\n\r\nDr. May pressed his hand in much emotion: and there was a silence\r\nbefore another question--whether there were nothing that could be of\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\'One chance there is, that Sam might relent enough to put that receipt\r\nwhere it could be found without implicating him.  He must know what it\r\nwould do for me.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are convinced that he has it?\'\r\n\r\n\'There must be papers in the book valuable to him; perhaps some that he\r\nhad rather were not seen.  Most likely he secured it in the morning.\r\nYou remember he was there before the police.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ay! ay! ay! the scoundrel!  But, Leonard, what possessed you not to\r\nspeak out at the inquest, when we might have searched every soul on the\r\npremises?\'\r\n\r\n\'I did not see it then.  I was stunned by the horror of the thing--the\r\nroom where I had been so lately, and that blood on my own rifle too.\r\nIt was all I could do at one time not to faint, and I had no notion\r\nthey would not take my explanation; then, when I found it rejected, and\r\neverything closing in on me, I was in a complete maze. It was not till\r\nyesterday, when I was alone again, after having gone over my defence\r\nwith Mr. Bramshaw, and shown what I could prove, that I saw exactly how\r\nit must have been, as clear as a somnambulist.  I sometimes could fancy\r\nI had seen Sam listening at the window, and have to struggle not to\r\nthink I knew him under the stable wall.\'\r\n\r\n\'And you are not such a--such a--so absurd as to sacrifice yourself to\r\nany scruple, and let the earth be cumbered with a rascal who, if he be\r\nwithholding the receipt, is committing a second murder!  It is not\r\ngenerosity, it is suicide.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is not generosity,\' said the boy, \'for if there were any hope, that\r\nwould not stop me; but no one heard nor saw but myself, and I neither\r\nrecognized him--no, I did not--nor heard anything definite from my\r\nuncle.  Even if I had, no one--no one but you, believes a word I speak;\r\nnay, even my own case shows what probabilities are worth, and that I\r\nmay be doing him the same wrong that I am suffering.  I should only\r\nbring on myself the shame and disgrace of accusing another.\'\r\n\r\nThe steady low voice and unboyish language showed him to be speaking\r\nfrom reflection, not impulse.  The only tremulous moment was when he\r\nspoke of the one friend who trusted him, and whom his words were\r\nfilling with a tumult of hope and alarm, admiration, indignation, and\r\nperplexity.\r\n\r\n\'Well, well,\' the Doctor said, almost stammering, \'I am glad you have\r\nbeen open with me.  It may be a clue.  Can there be any excuse for\r\noverhauling his papers?  Or can\'t we pick a hole in that alibi of his?\r\nNow I recollect, he had it very pat, and unnecessarily prominent.  I\'ll\r\nfind some way of going to work without compromising you.  Yes, you may\r\ntrust me!  I\'ll watch, but say not a word without your leave.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you,\' said Leonard.  \'I am glad it is you--you who would never\r\nthink a vague hope of saving me better than disgrace and dishonour.\'\r\n\r\n\'We will save you,\' said the Doctor, becoming eager to escape to that\r\nfavourite counsellor, the lining of his brougham, which had inspired\r\nhim with the right theory of many a perplexing symptom, and he trusted\r\nwould show him how to defend without betraying Leonard.  \'I must go and\r\nsee about it.  Is there anything I can do for you--books, or anything?\'\r\n\r\nNo, thank you--except--I suppose there would be no objection to my\r\nhaving a few finer steel pens.  \'And to explain his wants, he took up\r\nhis Prayer-Book, which his sister had decorated with several small\r\ndevotional prints.  Copying these minutely line by line in pen and ink,\r\nwas the solace of his prison hours; and though the work was hardly\r\nafter drawing-masters\' rules, the hand was not untaught, and there was\r\ntalent and soul enough in the work to strike the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\'It suits me best,\' said Leonard.  \'I should go distracted with nothing\r\nto do; and I can\'t read much--at least, not common books. And my\r\nsisters may like to have them.  Will you let me do one for you?\'\r\n\r\nThe speaking expression of those hazel eyes almost overcame the Doctor,\r\nand his answer was by bending head and grasping hand. Leonard turned to\r\nthe Collects, and mutely opened at the print of the Son of Consolation,\r\nwhich he had already outlined, looked up at his friend, and turned\r\naway, only saying, \'Two or three of the sort with elastic nibs; they\r\nhave them at the post-office.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I\'ll take care,\' said Dr. May, afraid to trust his self-command\r\nany longer.  \'Good-bye, Leonard.  Tom says I adopt every one who gets\r\nthrough a bad enough fever, so what will you be to me after this second\r\nattack?\'\r\n\r\nThe result of the Doctor\'s consultation with his brougham was his\r\nstopping it at Mr. Bramshaw\'s door, to ascertain whether the search for\r\nthe receipt had extended to young Axworthy\'s papers; but he found that\r\nthey had been thoroughly examined, every facility having been given by\r\ntheir owner, who was his uncle\'s executor, and residuary legatee, by a\r\nwill dated five years back, leaving a thousand pounds to the late Mrs.\r\nWard, and a few other legacies, but the mass of the property to the\r\nnephew.\r\n\r\nSam\'s \'facilities\' not satisfying the Doctor, it was further explained\r\nthat every endeavour was being made to discover what other documents\r\nwere likely to have been kept in the missing memorandum-book, so as to\r\nlead to the detection of any person who might present any such at a\r\nbank; and it was made evident that everything was being done, short of\r\nthe impracticability of searching an unaccused man, but he could not\r\nbut perceive that Mr. Bramshaw\'s \'ifs\' indicated great doubt of the\r\nexistence of receipt and of pocket-book.  Throwing out a hint that the\r\ntime of Sam\'s return should be investigated, he learnt that this had\r\nbeen Edward Anderson\'s first measure, and that it was clear, from the\r\nindependent testimony of the ostler at Whitford, the friend who had\r\ndriven Sam, and the landlord of the Three Goblets, that there was not\r\nmore than time for the return exactly as described at the inquest; and\r\nthough the horse was swift and powerful, and might probably have been\r\ndriven at drunken speed, this was too entirely conjectural for anything\r\nto be founded on it. Nor had the cheque by Bilson on the Whitford Bank\r\ncome in.\r\n\r\n\'Something must assuredly happen to exonerate the guiltless, it would\r\nbe profane to doubt,\' said Dr. May continually to himself and to the\r\nWards; but Leonard\'s secret was a painful burthen that he could\r\nscarcely have borne without sharing it with that daughter who was his\r\nother self, and well proved to be a safe repository.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s my Leonard,\' said Ethel.  \'I know him much better now than any\r\ntime since the elf-bolt affair!  They have not managed to ruin him\r\namong them.\'\r\n\r\n\'What do you call this?\' said Dr. May, understanding her, indeed, but\r\nwilling to hear her thought expressed.\r\n\r\n\'Thankworthy,\' she answered, with a twitching of the corners of her\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n\'You will suffer for this exaltation,\' he said, sadly; \'you know you\r\nhave a tender heart, for all your flights.\'\r\n\r\n\'And you know you have a soul as well as a heart,\' said Ethel, as well\r\nas the swelling in her throat would allow.\r\n\r\n\'To be sure, this world would be a poor place to live in, if admiration\r\ndid not make pity bearable,\' said the Doctor; \'but--but don\'t ask me,\r\nEthel: you have not had that fine fellow in his manly patience before\r\nyour eyes.  Talk of your knowing him!  You knew a boy!  I tell you,\r\nthis has made him a man, and one of a thousand--so high-minded and so\r\nsimple, so clearheaded and well-balanced, so entirely resigned and free\r\nfrom bitterness!  What could he not be? It would be grievous to see him\r\ncut off by a direct dispensation--sickness, accident, battle; but for\r\nhim to come to such an end, for the sake of a double\r\nmurderer--Ethel--it would almost stagger one\'s faith!\'\r\n\r\n\'Almost!\' repeated Ethel, with the smile of a conqueror.\r\n\r\n\'I know, I know,\' said the Doctor.  \'If it be so, it will be right; one\r\nwill try to believe it good for him.  Nay, there\'s proof enough in what\r\nit has done for him already.  If you could only see him!\'\r\n\r\n\'I mean to see him, if it should go against him,\' said Ethel, \'if you\r\nwill let me.  I would go to him as I would if he were in a decline, and\r\nwith more reverence.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t talk of it,\' cried her father.  \'For truth\'s sake, for justice\'s\r\nsake, for the country\'s sake, I can not, will not, believe it will go\r\nwrong.  There is a Providence, after all, Ethel!\'\r\n\r\nAnd the Doctor went away, afraid alike of hope and despondency, and\r\nEthel thought of the bright young face, of De Wilton, of Job, and of\r\nthe martyrs; and when she was not encouraging Aubrey, or soothing\r\nAveril, her heart would sink, and the tears that would not come would\r\nhave been very comfortable.\r\n\r\nIt was well for all that the assizes were so near that the suspense was\r\nnot long protracted; for it told upon all concerned.  Leonard, when the\r\nDoctor saw him again, was of the same way of thinking, but his manner\r\nwas more agitated; he could not sleep, or if he slept, the\r\nanticipations chased away in the day-time revenged themselves in his\r\ndreams; and he was very unhappy, also, about his sister, whose illness\r\ncontinued day after day.  She was not acutely ill, but in a constant\r\nstate of low fever, every faculty in the most painful state of tension,\r\nconvinced that she was quite able to get up and go to Leonard, and that\r\nher detention was mere cruelty; and then, on trying to rise, refused by\r\nfainting.  Her searching questions and ardent eyes made it impossible\r\nto keep any feature in the case from her knowledge.  Sleep was\r\nimpossible to her; and once when Henry tried the effect of an anodyne,\r\nit produced a semi-delirium, which made him heartily repent of his\r\nindependent measure.  At all times she was talking--nothing but the\r\nbeing left with a very stolid maid-servant ever closed her lips, and\r\nshe so greatly resented being thus treated, that the measure was seldom\r\npossible.  Henry seldom left her.  He was convinced that Leonard\'s\r\nsentence would be hers likewise, and he watched over her with the\r\nutmost tenderness and patience with her fretfulness and waywardness,\r\nnever quitting her except on their brother\'s behalf, when Ethel or Mary\r\nwould take his place.  Little Minna was always to be found on her small\r\nchair by the bed-side, or moving about like a mouse, sometimes\r\nwhispering her one note, \'They can\'t hurt him, if he has not done it,\'\r\nand still quietly working at the pair of slippers that had been begun\r\nfor his birthday present. Mary used to bring Ella, and take them out\r\nwalking in the least-frequented path; but though the little sisters\r\nkissed eagerly, and went fondly hand in hand, they never were sorry to\r\npart:  Ella\'s spirits oppressed Minna, and Minna\'s depression vexed the\r\nmore volatile sister; moreover, Minna always dreaded Mary\'s desire to\r\ncarry her away--as, poor child, she looked paler, and her eyes heavier\r\nand darker, every day.\r\n\r\nNo one else, except, of course, Dr. May, was admitted.  Henry would not\r\nlet his sister see Mr. Scudamour or Mr. Wilmot, lest she should be\r\nexcited; and Averil\'s \'No one\' was vehement as a defence against Mrs.\r\nPugh or Mrs. Ledwich, whom she suspected of wanting to see her, though\r\nshe never heard of more than their daily inquiries.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pugh was, in spite of her exclusion, the great authority with the\r\nneighbourhood for all the tidings of \'the poor Wards,\' of whom she\r\ntalked with the warmest commiseration, relating every touching detail\r\nof their previous and present history, and continually enduring the\r\ngreat shock of meeting people in shops or in the streets, whom she knew\r\nto be reporters or photographers.  In fact, the catastrophe had taken a\r\nstrong hold on the public mind; and \'Murder of an Uncle by his Nephew,\'\r\n\'The Blewer Tragedy,\' figured everywhere in the largest type; newsboys\r\non the railway shouted, \'To-day\'s paper-account of inquest;\' and the\r\nillustrated press sent down artists, whose three-legged cameras stared\r\nin all directions, from the Vintry Mill to Bankside, and who aimed at\r\nthe school, the Minster, the volunteers, and Dr. Hoxton himself.  Tom\r\nadvised Ethel to guard Mab carefully from appearing stuffed in the\r\nchamber of horrors at Madame Tussaud\'s; and the furniture at the mill\r\nwould have commanded any price.  Nay, Mrs. Pugh was almost certain she\r\nhad seen one of the \'horrid men\' bargaining with the local photographer\r\nfor her own portrait, in her weeds, and was resolved the interesting\r\ninjury should never be forgiven!\r\n\r\nShe really had the \'trying scenes\' of two interviews with both Mr.\r\nBramshaw and the attorney from Whitford who was getting up the\r\nprosecution, each having been told that she was in possession of\r\nimportant intelligence.  Mr. Bramshaw was not sanguine as to what he\r\nmight obtain from her, but flattered her with the attempt, and ended by\r\nassuring her, like his opponent, that there was no need to expose her\r\nto the unpleasantness of appearing in court.\r\n\r\nAubrey was not to have the same relief, but was, like his father,\r\nsubpoenaed as a witness for the prosecution.  He had followed his\r\nfather\'s advice, and took care not to disclose his evidence to the\r\nenemy, as he regarded the Whitford lawyer.  He was very miserable, and\r\nit was as much for his sake as that of the immediate family, that Ethel\r\nrejoiced that the suspense was to be short.  Counsel of high reputation\r\nhad been retained; but as the day came nearer, without bringing any of\r\nthe disclosures on which the Doctor had so securely reckoned, more and\r\nmore stress was laid on the dislike to convict on circumstantial\r\nevidence, and on the saying that the English law had rather acquit ten\r\ncriminals than condemn one innocent man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n  Ah! I mind me now of thronging faces,\r\n    Mocking eyed, and eager, as for sport;\r\n  Hundreds looking up, and in high places\r\n    Men arrayed for judgment and a court.\r\n\r\n  And I heard, or seemed to hear, one seeking\r\n    Answer back from one he doomed to die,\r\n  Pitifully, sadly, sternly speaking\r\n    Unto one--and oh! that one, twas I.--Rev. G. E. Monsell\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \'Blewer Murder\' was the case of the Assize week; and the court was\r\nso crowded that, but for the favour of the sheriff, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nRivers, with Tom and Gertrude, could hardly have obtained seats.  No\r\nothers of the family could endure to behold the scene, except from\r\nnecessity; and indeed Ethel and Mary had taken charge of the sisters at\r\nhome, for Henry could not remain at a distance from his brother, though\r\nunable to bear the sight of the proceedings; he remained in a house at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nNearly the whole population of Stoneborough, Whitford, and Blewer was\r\nstriving to press into court, but before the day\'s work began, Edward\r\nAnderson had piloted Mrs. Pugh to a commodious place, under the escort\r\nof his brother Harvey, who was collecting materials for an article on\r\ncriminal jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nSome of those who, like the widow and little Gertrude, had been wild to\r\nbe present, felt their hearts fail them when the last previous case had\r\nbeen disposed of; and there was a brief pause of grave and solemn\r\nsuspense and silent breathless expectation within the court, unbroken,\r\nexcept by increased sounds of crowding in all the avenues without.\r\n\r\nEvery one, except the mere loungers, who craved nothing but excitement,\r\nlooked awed and anxious; and the impression was deepened by the\r\nperception that the same feeling, though restrained, affected the judge\r\nhimself, and was visible in the anxious attention with which he looked\r\nat the papers before him, and the stern sadness that had come over the\r\nfeatures naturally full of kindness and benevolence.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner appeared in the dock.  He had become paler, and perhaps\r\nthinner, for his square determined jaw, and the resolute mould of his\r\nlips, were more than usually remarkable, and were noted in the\r\nphysiognomical brain of Harvey Anderson; as well as the keen light of\r\nhis full dark hazel eye, the breadth of his brow, with his shining\r\nlight brown hair brushed back from it; the strong build of his frame,\r\nand the determined force, apparent even in the perfect quiescence of\r\nhis attitude.\r\n\r\nLeonard Axworthy Ward was arraigned for the wilful murder of Francis\r\nAxworthy, and asked whether he pleaded Guilty or Not Guilty.\r\n\r\nHis voice was earnest, distinct, and firm, and his eyes were raised\r\nupwards, as though he were making the plea of \'Not Guilty\' not to man\r\nalone, but to the Judge of all the earth.\r\n\r\nThe officer of the court informed him of his right to challenge any of\r\nthe jury, as they were called over by name; and as each came to be\r\nsworn, he looked full and steadily at each face, more than one of which\r\nwas known to him by sight, as if he were committing his cause into\r\ntheir hands.  He declined to challenge; and then crossing his arms on\r\nhis breast, cast down his eyes, and thus retained them through the\r\ngreater part of the trial.\r\n\r\nThe jurymen were then sworn in, and charged with the issue; and the\r\ncounsel for the prosecution opened the case, speaking more as if in\r\npity than indignation, as he sketched the history, which it was his\r\npainful duty to establish.  He described how Mr. Axworthy, having spent\r\nthe more active years of his life in foreign trade, had finally\r\nreturned to pass his old age among his relatives; and had taken to\r\nassist him in his business a great-nephew, and latterly another youth\r\nin the same degree of relation, the son of his late niece--the\r\nprisoner, who on leaving school had been taken into his uncle\'s office,\r\nlodged in the house, and became one of the family.  It would, however,\r\nbe shown by witnesses that the situation had been extremely irksome to\r\nthe young man; and that he had not been in it many months before he had\r\nexpressed his intention of absconding, provided he could obtain the\r\nmeans of making his way in one of the colonies. Then followed a summary\r\nof the deductions resulting from the evidence about to be adduced, and\r\nwhich carried upon its face the inference that the absence of the\r\ncousin, the remoteness of the room, the sight of a large sum of money,\r\nand the helplessness of the old man, had proved temptations too strong\r\nfor a fiery and impatient youth, long fretted by the restraints of his\r\nsituation, and had conducted him to violence, robbery, and flight.  It\r\nwas a case that could not be regarded without great regret and\r\ncompassion; but the gentlemen of the jury must bear in mind in their\r\ninvestigation, that pity must not be permitted to distort the facts,\r\nwhich he feared were only too obvious.\r\n\r\nThe speech was infinitely more telling from its fair and commiserating\r\ntone towards the prisoner; and the impression that it carried, not that\r\nhe was to be persecuted by having the crime fastened on him, but that\r\ntruth must be sought out at all hazards.\r\n\r\n\'Even he is sorry for Leonard!  I don\'t hate him as I thought I\r\nshould,\' whispered Gertrude May, to her elder sister. The first witness\r\nwas, as before, the young maid-servant, Anne Ellis, who described her\r\nfirst discovery of the body; and on farther interrogation, the\r\nsituation of the room, distant from those of the servants, and out of\r\nhearing--also her master\'s ordinary condition of feebleness.  She had\r\nobserved nothing in the room, or on the table, but knew the window was\r\nopen, since she had run to it, and screamed for help, upon which Master\r\nHardy had come to her aid.\r\n\r\nLeonard\'s counsel then elicited from her how low the window was, and\r\nhow easily it could be entered from without.\r\n\r\nJames Hardy corroborated all this, giving a more minute account of the\r\nstate of the room; and telling of his going to call the young\r\ngentlemen, and finding the open passage window and empty bed-room. The\r\npassage window would naturally be closed at night; and there was no\r\nreason to suppose that Mr. Ward would be absent.  The bag shown to him\r\nwas one that had originally been made for the keeping of cash, but\r\nlatterly had been used for samples of grain, and he had last seen it in\r\nthe office.\r\n\r\nThe counsel for the prisoner inquired what had been on the table at\r\nHardy\'s first entrance; but to this the witness could not swear, except\r\nthat the lamp was burning, and that there were no signs of disorder,\r\nnor was the dress of the deceased disarranged.  He had seen his master\r\nput receipts, and make memorandums, in a large, black, silver-clasped\r\npocket-book, but had never handled it, and could not swear to it; he\r\nhad seen nothing like it since his master\'s death. He was further asked\r\nhow long the prisoner had been at the mill, his duties there, and the\r\namount of trust reposed in him; to which last the answer was, that\r\nabout a month since, Mr. Axworthy had exclaimed that if ever he wanted\r\na thing to be done, he must set Ward about it. Saving this speech, made\r\nin irritation at some omission on Sam\'s part, nothing was adduced to\r\nshow that Leonard was likely to have been employed without his cousin\'s\r\nknowledge; though Hardy volunteered the addition that Mr. Ward was\r\nalways respectful and attentive, and that his uncle had lately thought\r\nmuch more of him than at first.\r\n\r\nRebekah Giles gave her account of the scene in the sitting-room.  She\r\nhad been in the service of the deceased for the last four years, and\r\nbefore in that of his sister-in-law, Mr. Samuel\'s mother.  She had\r\nherself closed the passage window at seven o\'clock in the evening, as\r\nusual.  She had several times previously found it partly open in the\r\nmorning, after having thus shut it over-night; but never before, Mr.\r\nWard\'s bed unslept in.  Her last interview with Mr. Axworthy was then\r\nnarrated, with his words--an imprecation against rifle practice, as an\r\nexcuse for idle young rascals to be always out of the way.  Then\r\nfollowed her communication to the prisoner at half-past nine, when she\r\nsaw him go into the parlour, in his volunteer uniform, rifle in hand,\r\nheard him turn the lock of the sitting-room door, and then herself\r\nretired to bed.\r\n\r\nCross-examination did not do much with her, only showing that, when she\r\nbrought in the supper, one window had been open, and the blinds, common\r\ncalico ones, drawn down, thus rendering it possible for a person to\r\nlurk unseen in the court, and enter by the window.  Her master had\r\nassigned no reason for sending for Mr. Ward.  She did not know whether\r\nMr. Axworthy had any memorandum-book; she had seen none on the table,\r\nnor found any when she undressed the body, though his purse, watch, and\r\nseals were on his person.\r\n\r\nMr. Rankin\'s medical evidence came next, both as to the cause of death,\r\nthe probable instrument, and the nature of the stains on the desk and\r\nrifle.\r\n\r\nWhen cross-examined, he declared that he had looked at the volunteer\r\nuniform without finding any mark of blood, but from the nature of the\r\ninjury it was not likely that there would be any.  He had attended Mr.\r\nAxworthy for several years, and had been visiting him professionally\r\nduring a fit of the gout in the last fortnight of June, when he had\r\nobserved that the prisoner was very attentive to his uncle.  Mr.\r\nAxworthy was always unwilling to be waited on, but was unusually\r\ntolerant of this nephew\'s exertions on his behalf, and had seemed of\r\nlate to place much reliance on him.\r\n\r\nDoctor Richard May was the next witness called.  The sound of that name\r\ncaused the first visible change in the prisoner\'s demeanour, if that\r\ncould be called change, which was only a slight relaxation of the firm\r\nclosing of the lips, and one sparkle of the dark eyes, ere they were\r\nagain bent down as before, though not without a quiver of the lids.\r\n\r\nDr. May had brought tone, look, and manner to the grave impartiality\r\nwhich even the most sensitive man is drilled into assuming in public;\r\nbut he durst not cast one glance in the direction of the prisoner.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the counsel for the prosecution, he stated that he was at\r\nthe Vintry Mill at seven o\'clock on the morning of the 6th of July, not\r\nprofessionally, but as taking interest in the Ward family. He had seen\r\nthe body of the deceased, and considered death to have been occasioned\r\nby fracture of the skull, from a blow with a blunt heavy instrument.\r\nThe superintendent had shown him a rifle, which he considered, from the\r\nmarks on it, as well as from the appearance of the body, to have\r\nproduced the injury.  The rifle was the one shown to him; it was the\r\nproperty of Leonard Ward.  He recognized it by the crest and cipher H.\r\nE.  It had belonged to his son-in-law, Hector Ernescliffe, by whom it\r\nhad been given to Leonard Ward.\r\n\r\nPoor Doctor!  That was a cruel piece of evidence; and his son and\r\ndaughters opposite wondered how he could utter it in that steady\r\nmatter-of-fact way; but they knew him to be sustained by hopes of the\r\ncross-examination; and he soon had the opportunity of declaring that he\r\nhad known Leonard Ward from infancy, without being aware of any\r\nimputation against him; but had always seen him highly principled and\r\ntrustworthy, truthful and honourable, kind-hearted and humane--the last\r\nperson to injure the infirm or aged.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the good Doctor, less afraid of the sound of his own voice, and\r\nnot so much in awe as some of the other witnesses, here in his\r\neagerness overstepped the bounds of prudence.  His words indeed brought\r\na tremulous flicker of grateful emotion over the prisoner\'s face; but\r\nby carrying the inquiry into the region of character and opinion, he\r\nopened the door to a dangerous re-examination by the Crown lawyer, who\r\nrequired the exact meaning of his unqualified commendation, especially\r\nin the matter of humanity, demanding whether he had never known of any\r\nact of violence on the prisoner\'s part. The colour flushed suddenly\r\ninto Leonard\'s face, though he moved neither eye nor lip; but his\r\ncounsel appealed to the judge, and the pursuit of this branch of the\r\nsubject was quashed as irrelevant; but the Doctor went down in very low\r\nspirits, feeling that his evidence had been damaging, and his hopes of\r\nany ray of light becoming fainter.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the village policeman repeated the former statements, as to\r\nthe state of the various rooms, the desk, locked and untouched, the\r\nrifle, boat, &c., further explaining that the distance from the mill to\r\nBlewer Station, by the road was an hour and half\'s walk, by the fields,\r\nnot more than half an hour\'s.\r\n\r\nThe station-master proved the prisoner\'s arrival at midnight, his\r\ndemand of a day-ticket, his being without luggage, and in a black suit;\r\nand the London policeman proved the finding of the money on his person,\r\nand repeated his own explanation of it.\r\n\r\nThe money was all in sovereigns, except one five and one ten-pound\r\nnote, and Edward Hazlitt, the clerk of the Whitford Bank, was called to\r\nprove the having given the latter in change to Mr. Axworthy for a\r\nfifty-pound cheque, on the 10th of May last.\r\n\r\nThis same clerk had been at the volunteer drill on the evening of the\r\n5th of July, had there seen the prisoner, had parted with him at dusk,\r\ntowards nine o\'clock, making an engagement with him to meet on Blewer\r\nHeath for some private practice at seven o\'clock on Monday evening.\r\nThought Mr. Axworthy did sometimes employ young Ward on his\r\ncommissions; Mr. Axworthy had once sent him into Whitford to pay in a\r\nlarge sum, and another time with an order to be cashed. The dates of\r\nthese transactions were shown in the books; and Hazlitt added, on\r\nfurther interrogation, that Samuel Axworthy could not have been aware\r\nof the sum being sent to the bank, since he had shortly after come and\r\ndesired to see the account, which had been laid before him as\r\nconfidential manager, when he had shown surprise and annoyance at the\r\nrecent deposit, asking through whom it had been made.  Not ten days\r\nsubsequently, an order for nearly the entire amount had been cashed,\r\nsigned by the deceased, but filled up in Samuel\'s handwriting.\r\n\r\nThis had taken place in April; and another witness, a baker, proved the\r\nhaving paid the five-pound note to old Mr. Axworthy himself on the 2nd\r\nof May.\r\n\r\nSamuel Axworthy himself was next called.  His florid face wore\r\nsomething of the puffed, stupefied look it had had at the inquest, but\r\nhis words were ready, and always to the point.  He identified the bag\r\nin which the money had been found, giving an account of it similar to\r\nHardy\'s, and adding that he had last seen it lying by his cousin\'s\r\ndesk.  His uncle had no account with any London bank, all transactions\r\nhad of late passed through his own hands, and he had never known the\r\nprisoner employed in any business of importance--he could not have been\r\nkept in ignorance of it if it had previously been the case.  The\r\ndeceased had a black shagreen pocket-book, with a silver clasp, which\r\nhe occasionally used, but the witness had never known him give it out\r\nof his own hand, nor take a receipt in it.  Had not seen it on the\r\nmorning of the 6th, nor subsequently. Could not account for the sum\r\nfound on the person of the prisoner, whose salary was L50 per annum,\r\nand who had no private resources, except the interest of L2000, which,\r\nhe being a minor, was not in his own hands. Deceased was fond of\r\namassing sovereigns, and would often keep them for a longtime in the\r\ndrawer of his desk, as much as from L50 to L100.  There was none there\r\nwhen the desk was opened on the 6th of July, though there had certainly\r\nbeen gold there two days previously. It was kept locked.  It had a\r\nsmall Bramah key, which his uncle wore on his watch-chain, in his\r\nwaistcoat pocket.  The drawer was locked when he saw it on the morning\r\nof the 6th.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, who had joined his children, gave a deep respiration, and\r\nrelaxed the clenching of his hand, as this witness went down.\r\n\r\nThen it came to the turn of Aubrey Spencer May.  The long waiting,\r\nafter his nerves had been wound up, had been a severe ordeal, and his\r\ndelicacy of constitution and home breeding had rendered him peculiarly\r\nsusceptible.  With his resemblance to his father in form and\r\nexpression, it was like seeing the Doctor denuded of that shell of\r\nendurance with which he had contrived to conceal his feelings. The boy\r\nwas indeed braced to resolution, bat the resolution was equally visible\r\nwith the agitation in the awe-stricken brow, varying colour, tightened\r\nbreath, and involuntary shiver, as he took the oath.  Again Leonard\r\nlooked up with one of his clear bright glances, and perhaps a shade of\r\nanxiety; but Aubrey, for his own comfort, was too short-sighted for\r\nmeeting of eyes from that distance.\r\n\r\nSeeing his agitation, and reckoning on his evidence, the counsel gave\r\nhim time, by minutely asking if his double Christian name were\r\ncorrectly given, his age, and if he were not the son of Dr. May.\r\n\r\n\'You were the prisoner\'s school-fellow, I believe?\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' faltered Aubrey.\r\n\r\n\'But you live near him?\'\r\n\r\n\'We are friends,\' said Aubrey, with sudden firmness and precision; and\r\nfrom the utterance of that emphatic _are_, his spirit returned.\r\n\r\n\'Did you often see him?\'\r\n\r\n\'On most Sundays, after church.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did you ever hear him say he had any thoughts of the means of leaving\r\nthe mill privately?\'\r\n\r\n\'Something like it,\' said Aubrey, turning very red.\r\n\r\n\'Can you tell me the words?\'\r\n\r\n\'He said if things went on, that I was not to be surprised if I heard\r\nnon est inventus,\' said Aubrey, speaking as if rapidity would conceal\r\nthe meaning of the words, but taken aback by being made to repeat and\r\ntranslate them to the jury.\r\n\r\n\'And did he mention any way of escaping?\'\r\n\r\n\'He said the window and cedar-tree were made for it, and that he often\r\nwent out that way to bathe,\' said Aubrey.\r\n\r\n\'When did this conversation take place?\'\r\n\r\n\'On Sunday, the 22nd of June,\' said Aubrey, in despair, as the Crown\r\nlawyer thanked him, and sat down.\r\n\r\nHe felt himself betrayed into having made their talk wear the air of\r\ndeliberate purpose, and having said not one word of what Mr. Bramshaw\r\nhad hailed as hopeful.  However, the defending barrister rose up to ask\r\nhim what he meant by having answered \'Something like it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Because,\' said Aubrey, promptly, \'though we did make the scheme, we\r\nwere neither of us in earnest.\'\r\n\r\n\'How do you know the prisoner was not in earnest?\'\r\n\r\n\'We often made plans of what we should like to do.\'\r\n\r\n\'And had you any reason for thinking this one of such plans!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Aubrey; \'for he talked of getting gold enough to build up\r\nthe market-cross, or else of going to see the Feejee Islands.\r\n\r\n\'Then you understood the prisoner not to express a deliberate purpose,\r\nso much as a vague design.\'\r\n\r\n\'Just so,\' said Aubrey.  \'A design that depended on how things went on\r\nat the mill.\'  And being desired to explain his words, he added, that\r\nLeonard had said he could not bear the sight of Sam Axworthy\'s tyranny\r\nover the old man, and was resolved not to stay, if he were made a party\r\nto any of the dishonest tricks of the trade.\r\n\r\n\'In that case, did he say where he would have gone?\'\r\n\r\n\'First to New Zealand, to my brother, the Reverend Norman May.\'\r\n\r\nLeonard\'s counsel was satisfied with the colour the conversation had\r\nnow assumed; but the perils of re-examination were not over yet, for\r\nthe adverse lawyer requested to know whence the funds were to have come\r\nfor this adventurous voyage.\r\n\r\n\'We laughed a little about that, and he said he should have to try how\r\nfar his quarter\'s salary would go towards a passage in the steerage.\'\r\n\r\n\'If your friend expressed so strong a distaste to his employers and\r\ntheir business, what induced him to enter it?\'\r\n\r\nLeonard\'s counsel again objected to this inquiry, and it was not\r\npermitted.  Aubrey was dismissed, and, flushed and giddy, was met by\r\nhis brother Tom, who almost took him in his arms as he emerged from the\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n\'O, Tom! what have I done?\'\r\n\r\n\'Famously, provided there\'s no miller in the jury.  Come,\' as he felt\r\nthe weight on his arm, \'Flora says I am to take you down and make you\r\ntake something.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no, no, I can\'t!  I must go back.\'\r\n\r\n\'I tell you there\'s nothing going on.  Every one is breathing and\r\nbaiting.\'  And he got him safe to a pastrycook\'s, and administered\r\nbrandy cherries, which Aubrey bolted whole like pills, only entreating\r\nto return, and wanting to know how he thought the case going.\r\n\r\n\'Excellently.  Hazlitt\'s evidence and yours ought to carry him through.\r\nAnd Anderson says they have made so much out of the witnesses for the\r\nprosecution, that they need call none for the defence; and so the enemy\r\nwill be balked of their reply, and we shall have the last word.  I vow\r\nI have missed my vocation.  I know I was born for a barrister!\'\r\n\r\n\'Now may we come back?\' said the boy, overwhelmed by his brother\'s\r\ncheeriness; and they squeezed into court again, Tom inserting Aubrey\r\ninto his own former seat, and standing behind him on half a foot at the\r\nangle of the passage.  They were in time for the opening of the\r\ndefence, and to hear Leonard described as a youth of spirit and\r\npromise, of a disposition that had won him general affection and\r\nesteem, and recommended to universal sympathy by the bereavement which\r\nwas recent in the memory of his fellow-townsmen; and there was a glance\r\nat the mourning which the boy still wore.\r\n\r\n\'They had heard indeed that he was quick-tempered and impulsive; but\r\nthe gentlemen of the jury were some of them fathers, and he put it to\r\nthem whether a ready and generous spirit of indignation in a lad were\r\ncompatible with cowardly designs against helpless old age; whether one\r\nwhose recreations were natural science and manly exercise, showed\r\ntokens of vicious tendencies; above all, whether a youth, whose\r\nfriendship they had seen so touchingly claimed by a son of one of the\r\nmost highly respected gentlemen in the county, were evincing the\r\npropensities that lead to the perpetration of deeds of darkness.\'\r\n\r\nTom patted Aubrey on the shoulder; and Aubrey, though muttering\r\n\'humbug,\' was by some degrees less wretched.\r\n\r\n\'Men did not change their nature on a sudden,\' the counsel continued;\r\n\'and where was the probability that a youth of character entirely\r\nunblemished, and of a disposition particularly humane and generous,\r\nshould at once rush into a crime of the deep and deadly description, to\r\nwhich a long course of dissipation, leading to perplexity, distress,\r\nand despair, would be the only inducement?\'\r\n\r\nHe then went on to speak of Leonard\'s position at the mill, as junior\r\nclerk.  He had been there for six months, without a flaw being\r\ndetected, either in his integrity, his diligence, or his regularity;\r\nindeed, it was evident that he had been gradually acquiring a greater\r\ndegree of esteem and confidence than he had at first enjoyed, and had\r\nbeen latterly more employed by his uncle.  That a young man of superior\r\neducation should find the daily drudgery tedious and distasteful, and\r\nthat one of sensitive honour should be startled at the ordinary, he\r\nmight almost say proverbial, customs of the miller\'s trade, was\r\nsurprising to no one; and that he should unbosom himself to a friend of\r\nhis own age, and indulge together with him in romantic visions of\r\nadventure, was, to all who remembered their own boyhood, an\r\nillustration of the freshness and ingenuousness of the character that\r\nthus unfolded itself.  Where there were day-dreams, there was no room\r\nfor plots of crime.\r\n\r\nThen ensued a species of apology for the necessity of entering into\r\nparticulars that did not redound to the credit of a gentleman, who had\r\nappeared before the court under such distressing circumstances as Mr.\r\nSamuel Axworthy; but it was needful that the condition of the family\r\nshould be well understood, in order to comprehend the unhappy train of\r\nevents which had conducted the prisoner into his present situation.  He\r\nthen went through what had been traceable through the evidence--that\r\nSamuel Axworthy was a man of expensive habits, and accustomed to drain\r\nhis uncle\'s resources to supply his own needs; showing how the sum,\r\nwhich had been intrusted to the prisoner, to be paid into the local\r\nbank, had been drawn out by the elder nephew as soon as he became aware\r\nof the deposit; and how, shortly after, the prisoner had expressed to\r\nAubrey May his indignation at the tyranny exercised on his uncle.\r\n\r\n\'By and by, another sum is amassed,\' continued Leonard\'s advocate. \'How\r\ndispose of it?  The local bank is evidently no security from the\r\nrapacity of the elder nephew.  Once aware of its existence, he knows\r\nhow to use means for compelling its surrender; and the feeble old man\r\ncan no longer call his hard-earned gains his own except on sufferance.\r\nThe only means of guarding it is to lodge it secretly in a distant\r\nbank, without the suspicion of his nephew Samuel; but the invalid is\r\ntoo infirm to leave his apartment; his fingers, crippled by gout,\r\nrefuse even to guide the pen.  He can only watch for an opportunity,\r\nand this is at length afforded by the absence of the elder nephew for\r\ntwo days at the county races.  This will afford time for a trustworthy\r\nand intelligent messenger to convey the sum to town, deposit it in\r\nMessrs, Drummond\'s bank, and return unobserved. When, therefore, supper\r\nis brought in, Mr. Axworthy sends for the lad on whom he has learnt to\r\ndepend, and shows much disappointment at his absence.  Where is he?  Is\r\nhe engaged with low companions in the haunts of vice, that are the\r\ndeclivity towards crime?  Is he gaming, or betting, or drinking?  No.\r\nHe has obeyed the summons of his country; he is a zealous volunteer,\r\nand is eagerly using a weapon presented to him by a highly respected\r\ngentleman of large fortune in a neighbouring county; nay, so far is he\r\nfrom any sinister purpose, that he is making an appointment with a\r\nfellow-rifleman for the ensuing Monday.  On his return at dark, he\r\nreceives a pressing summons to his uncle\'s room, and hastens to obey it\r\nwithout pausing to lay aside his rifle.  The commission is explained,\r\nand well understanding the painfulness of the cause, he discreetly asks\r\nno questions, but prepares to execute it.  The sum of L124 12s. is\r\ntaken from the drawer of the desk, the odd money assigned to travelling\r\nexpenses, the L120 placed in a bag brought in from the office for the\r\npurpose, bearing the initials of the owner, and a receipt in a private\r\npocket-book was signed by him for the amount, and left open on the\r\ntable for the ink to dry.\r\n\r\n\'Who that has ever been young, can doubt the zest and elevation of\r\nreceiving for the first time a confidential mission?  Who can doubt\r\nthat even the favourite weapon would be forgotten where it stood, and\r\nthat it would only be accordant to accredited rules that the window\r\nshould be preferable to the door?  Had it not already figured in the\r\nvisions of adventure in the Sunday evening\'s walk? was it not a\r\nfavourite mode of exit in the mornings, when bathing and fishing were\r\nmore attractive than the pillow!  Moreover, the moonlight disclosed\r\nwhat appeared like a figure in the court-yard, and there was reason at\r\nthe time to suppose it a person likely to observe and report upon the\r\nexpedition.  The opening of the front door might likewise attract\r\nnotice; and if the cousin should, as was possible, return that night,\r\nthe direct road was the way to meet him.  The hour was too early for\r\nthe train which was to be met, but a lighted candle would reveal the\r\nvigil, and moonlight on the meadows was attractive at eighteen.\r\nGentlemen of soberer and maturer years might be incredulous, but surely\r\nit was not so strange or unusual for a lad, who indulged in visions of\r\nadventure, to find a moonlight walk by the river-side more inviting\r\nthan a bed-room.\r\n\r\n\'Shortly after, perhaps as soon as the light was extinguished, the\r\nmurder must have been committed.  The very presence of that light had\r\nbeen guardianship to the helpless old man below.  When it was quenched,\r\nnothing remained astir, the way from without was open, the weapon stood\r\nonly too ready to hand, the memorandum-book gave promise of booty and\r\nwas secured, though nothing else was apparently touched. It was this\r\nvery book that contained the signature that would have exonerated the\r\nprisoner, and to which he fearlessly appealed upon his arrest at the\r\nPaddington Station, before, for his additional misfortune, he had time\r\nto discharge himself of his commission, and establish his innocence by\r\nthe deposit of the money at the bank.  He has thus for a while become\r\nthe victim of a web of suspicious circumstances.  But look at these\r\nvery circumstances more closely, and they will be found perfectly\r\nconsistent with the prisoner\'s statement, never varying, be it\r\nremembered, from the explanation given to the policeman in first\r\nsurprise and horror of the tidings of the crime.\r\n\r\n\'It might have been perhaps thought that there was another alternative\r\nbetween entire innocence and a deliberate purpose of robbery and\r\nmurder-namely, that reproof from the old man had provoked a blow, and\r\nthat the means of flight had been hastily seized upon in the moment of\r\nconfusion and alarm.  This might have been a plausible line of defence,\r\nand secure of a favourable hearing; but I beg to state that the\r\nprisoner has distinctly refused any such defence, and my instructions\r\nare to contend for his perfect innocence.  A nature such as we have\r\nalready traced is, as we cannot but perceive, revolted by the bare idea\r\nof violence to the aged and infirm, and recoils as strongly from the\r\none accusation as from the other.\r\n\r\n\'The prisoner made his statement at the first moment, and has adhered\r\nto it in every detail, without confusion or self-contradiction.  It\r\ndoes not attempt to explain all the circumstances, but they all tally\r\nexactly with his story; he is unable to show by whom the crime could\r\nhave been committed, nor is he bound in law or justice so to do; nay,\r\nhis own story shows the absolute impossibility of his being able to\r\nexplain what took place in his absence.  But mark how completely the\r\nestablished facts corroborate his narrative.  Observe first the\r\nposition in which the body was found, the head on the desk, the stain\r\nof blood corresponding with the wound, the dress undisturbed, all\r\nmanifestly untouched since the fatal stroke was dealt.  Could this have\r\nbeen the case, had the key of the drawer of gold been taken from the\r\nwaistcoat pocket, the chain from about the neck of the deceased, and\r\nboth replaced after the removal of the money and relocking the drawer!\r\nCan any one doubt that the drawer was opened, the money taken out, and\r\nthe lock secured, while Mr. Axworthy was alive and consenting?  Again,\r\nwhat robber would convey away the spoil in a bag bearing the initials\r\nof the owner, and that not caught up in haste, but fetched in for the\r\npurpose from the office?  Or would so tell-tale a weapon as the rifle\r\nhave been left conspicuously close at hand?  There was no guilty\r\nprecipitation, for the uniform had been taken off and folded up, and\r\nwith a whole night before him, it would have been easy to reach a more\r\ndistant station, where his person would not have been recognized.  Why,\r\ntoo, if this were the beginning of a flight and exile, should no\r\npreparation have been made for passing a single night from home? why\r\nshould a day-ticket have been asked for?  No, the prisoner\'s own\r\nstraightforward, unvarnished statement is the only consistent\r\ninterpretation of the facts, otherwise conflicting and incomprehensible.\r\n\r\n\'That a murder has been committed is unhappily too certain.  I make no\r\nattempt to unravel the mystery.  I confine myself to the far more\r\ngrateful task of demonstrating, that to fasten the imputation on the\r\naccused, would be to overlook a complication of inconsistencies, all\r\nexplained by his own account of himself, but utterly inexplicable on\r\nthe hypothesis of his guilt.\r\n\r\n\'Circumstantial evidence is universally acknowledged to be perilous\r\nground for a conviction; and I never saw a case in which it was more\r\nmanifestly delusive than in the present, bearing at first an imposing\r\nand formidable aspect, but on examination, confuted in every detail.\r\nMost assuredly,\' continued the counsel, his voice becoming doubly\r\nearnest, \'while there is even the possibility of innocence, it becomes\r\nincumbent on you, gentlemen of the jury, to consider well the fearful\r\nconsequences of a decision in a matter of life or death--a decision for\r\nwhich there can be no reversal.  The facts that have come to light are\r\nmanifestly incomplete.  Another link in the chain has yet to be added;\r\nand when it shall come forth, how will it be if it should establish the\r\nguiltlessness of the prisoner too late?  Too late, when a young life of\r\nhigh promise, and linked by close family ties, and by bonds of ardent\r\nfriendship with so many, has been quenched in shame and disgrace, for a\r\ncrime to which he may be an utter stranger.\r\n\r\n\'The extinction of the light in that upper window was the sign for\r\ndarkness and horror to descend on the mill!  Here is the light of life\r\nstill burning, but a breath of yours can extinguish it in utter gloom,\r\nand then who may rekindle it!  Nay, the revelation of events that would\r\nmake the transactions of that fatal night clear as the noonday, would\r\nnever avail to rekindle the lamp, that may yet, I trust, shine forth to\r\nthe world--the clearer, it may be, from the unmerited imputations,\r\nwhich it has been my part to combat, and of which his entire life is a\r\nconfutation.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Pugh was sobbing under her veil; Gertrude felt the cause won. Tom\r\nnoiselessly clapped the orator behind his brother\'s back, and nodded\r\nhis approval to his father.  Even Leonard lifted up his face, and shot\r\nacross a look, as if he felt deliverance near after the weary day, that\r\nseemed to have been a lifetime already, though the sunbeams were only\r\nbeginning to fall high and yellow on the ceiling, through the heated\r\nstifling atmosphere, heavy with anxiety and suspense.  Doctor May was\r\nthinking of the meeting after the acquittal, of the telegram to\r\nStoneborough, of the sister\'s revival, and of Ethel\'s greeting.\r\n\r\nStill the judge had to sum up; and all eyes turned on him, knowing that\r\nthe fate of the accused would probably depend on the colouring that the\r\nfacts adduced would assume in his hands.  Flora, who met him in\r\nsociety, was struck by the grave and melancholy bracing, as it were, of\r\nthe countenance, that she had seen as kindly and bright as her\r\nfather\'s; and the deep, full voice, sad rather than stern, the very\r\ntone of which conveyed to every mind how heavy was the responsibility\r\nof justice and impartiality.  In effect, the very force of the\r\npersuasions made for the defence, unanswered by the prosecution,\r\nrendered it needful for him to give full weight to the evidence for the\r\nother side; namely, the prisoner\'s evident impatience of his position,\r\nand premeditated flight, the coincidence of the times, the being the\r\nlast person seen to enter the room, and with the very weapon that had\r\nbeen the instrument of the crime; the probability that the deceased had\r\nhimself opened the drawer, the open window, the flight, and the missing\r\nsum being found on his person, the allegation that the receipt would be\r\nfound in the pocket-book, unsupported by any testimony as to the\r\npractice of the deceased; the strangeness of leaving the premises so\r\nmuch too early for the train, and, by his own account, leaving a person\r\nprowling in the court, close to his uncle\'s window.  No opinion was\r\ngiven; but there was something that gave a sense that the judge felt it\r\na crushing weight of evidence.  Yet so minutely was every point\r\nexamined, so carefully was every indication weighed which could tend to\r\nestablish the prisoner\'s innocence, that to those among his audience\r\nwho believed that innocence indubitable, it seemed as if his arguments\r\nproved it, even more triumphantly than the pleading of the counsel, as,\r\nvibrating between hope and fear, anxiety and gratitude, they followed\r\nhim from point to point of the unhappy incident, hanging upon every\r\nword, as though each were decisive.\r\n\r\nWhen at length he ceased, and the jury retired, the breathless\r\nstillness continued.  With some, indeed, there was the relaxation of\r\nlong-strained attention, eyes unbent, and heads turned, but Flora had\r\nto pass her arm round her little sister, to steady the child\'s nervous\r\ntrembling; Aubrey sat rigid and upright, the throbs of his heart\r\nwell-nigh audible; and Dr. May leant forward, and covered his eyes with\r\nhis hand; Tom, who alone dared glance to the dock, saw that Leonard too\r\nhad retired.  Those were the most terrible minutes they had ever spent\r\nin their lives; but they were minutes of hope--of hope of relief from a\r\nburthen, becoming more intolerable with every second\'s delay ere the\r\nrebound.\r\n\r\nLong as it seemed to them, it was not in reality more than a quarter of\r\nan hour before the jury returned, and with slow grave movements, and\r\nserious countenances, resumed their places. Leonard was already in his;\r\nhis cheek paler, his fingers locked together, and his eyes scanning\r\neach as they came forward, and one by one their names were called over.\r\nHis head was erect, and his bearing had something undaunted, though\r\nintensely anxious.\r\n\r\nThe question was put by the clerk of the court, \'How find you? Guilty\r\nor Not guilty?\'\r\n\r\nFirmly, though sadly, the foreman rose, and his answer was, \'We find\r\nthe prisoner guilty; but we earnestly recommend him to mercy.\'\r\n\r\nWhether Tom felt or not that Aubrey was in a dead faint, and rested\r\nagainst him as a senseless weight, he paid no visible attention to\r\naught but one face, on which his eyes were riveted as though nothing\r\nwould ever detach them--and that face was not the prisoner\'s.\r\n\r\nOthers saw Leonard\'s face raised upwards, and a deep red flush spread\r\nover brow and cheek, though neither lip nor eye wavered.\r\n\r\nThen came the question whether the prisoner had anything to say,\r\nwherefore judgment should not be passed upon him.\r\n\r\nLeonard made a step forward, and his clear steady tone did not shake\r\nfor a moment as he spoke.  \'No.  I see that appearances are so much\r\nagainst me, that man can hardly decide otherwise.  I have known from\r\nthe first that nothing could show my innocence but the finding of the\r\nreceipt.  In the absence of that one testimony, I feel that I have had\r\na fair trial, and that all has been done for me that could be done; and\r\nI thank you for it, my Lord, and you, Gentlemen,\' as he bent his head;\r\nthen added, \'I should like to say one thing more.  My Lord, you would\r\nnot let the question be asked, how I brought all this upon myself.  I\r\nwish to say it myself, for it is that which makes my sentence just in\r\nthe sight of God.  It is true that, though I never lifted my hand\r\nagainst my poor uncle, I did in a moment of passion fling a stone at my\r\nbrother, which, but for God\'s mercy, might indeed have made me a\r\nmurderer.  It was for this, and other like outbreaks, that I was sent\r\nto the mill; and it may be just that for it I should die--though indeed\r\nI never hurt my uncle.\'\r\n\r\nPerhaps there was something in the tone of that one word, indeed,\r\nwhich, by recalling his extreme youth, touched all hearts more than\r\neven the manly tone of his answer, and his confession.  There was a\r\nuniversal weeping and sobbing throughout the court; Mrs. Pugh was on\r\nthe verge of hysterics, and obliged to be supported away; and Gertrude\r\nwas choking between the agony of contagious feeling and dread of\r\nFlora\'s displeasure; and all the time Leonard stood calm, with his\r\nbrave head and lofty bearing, wound up for the awful moment of the\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\nThe weeping was hushed, when the crier of the court made proclamation,\r\ncommanding all persons on pain of imprisonment to be silent.  Then the\r\njudge placed on his head the black cap, and it was with trembling hands\r\nthat he did so; the blood had entirely left his face, and his lips were\r\npurple with the struggle to contend with and suppress his emotion.  He\r\npaused, as though he were girding himself up to the most terrible of\r\nduties, and when he spoke his voice was hollow, as he began:\r\n\r\n\'Leonard Axworthy Ward, you have been found guilty of a crime that\r\nwould have appeared impossible in one removed from temptation by birth\r\nand education such as yours have been.  What the steps may have been\r\nthat led to such guilt, must lie between your own conscience and that\r\nGod whose justice you have acknowledged.  To Him you have evidently\r\nbeen taught to look; and may you use the short time that still remains\r\nto you, in seeking His forgiveness by sincere repentance.  I will\r\nforward the recommendation to mercy, but it is my duty to warn you that\r\nthere are no such palliating circumstances in the evidence, as to\r\nwarrant any expectation of a remission of the sentence.\r\n\r\nAnd therewith followed the customary form of sentence, ending with the\r\nsolemn \'And may God Almighty have mercy on your soul!\'\r\n\r\nFull and open, and never quailing, had the dark eyes been fixed upon\r\nthe judge all the time; and at those last words, the head bent low, and\r\nthe lips moved for \'Amen.\'\r\n\r\nThen Tom, relieved to find instant occupation for his father, drew his\r\nattention to Aubrey\'s state; and the boy between Tom and George Rivers\r\nwas, as best they could, carried through the narrow outlets, and laid\r\ndown in a room, opened to them by the sheriff, where his father and\r\nFlora attended him, while Tom flew for remedies; and Gertrude sobbed\r\nand wept as she had never done in her life.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before the swoon yielded, or Dr. May could leave his\r\nson, and then he was bent on at once going to the prisoner; but he was\r\nso shaken and tremulous, that Tom insisted on giving him his arm, and\r\nheld an umbrella over him in the driving rain.\r\n\r\n\'Father,\' he said, as soon as they were in the street, \'I can swear who\r\ndid it.\'\r\n\r\nDr. May just hindered himself from uttering the name, but Tom answered\r\nas if it had been spoken.\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  I saw the face of fiendish barbarity that once was over me, when\r\nI was a miserable little school-boy!  He did it; and he has the\r\nreceipt.\'\r\n\r\nDr. May squeezed his arm.  \'I have not betrayed the secret, have I!\'\r\n\r\n\'You knew that he knew it!\'\r\n\r\n\'Not knew--suspected--generosity.\'\r\n\r\n\'I saw him!  I saw him cast those imploring earnest eyes of his on the\r\nscoundrel as he spoke of the receipt--and the villain try to make\r\nhimself of stone.  Well, if I have one wish in life, it is to see that\r\nfellow come to the fate he deserves.  I\'ll never lose sight of him;\r\nI\'ll dog him like a bloodhound!\'\r\n\r\nAnd what good will that do, when--Tom, Tom, we must move Heaven and\r\nearth for petitions.  I\'ll take them up myself, and get George Rivers\r\nto take me to the Home Secretary.  Never fear, while there\'s justice in\r\nHeaven.\'\r\n\r\n\'Here\'s Henry!\' exclaimed Tom, withholding his father, who had almost\r\nran against the brother, as they encountered round a corner.\r\n\r\nHe was pale and bewildered, and hardly seemed to hear the Doctor\'s\r\nhasty asseverations that he would get a reprieve.\r\n\r\n\'He sent me to meet you,\' said Henry.  \'He wants you to go home--to Ave\r\nI mean.  He says that is what he wants most--for you to go to her now,\r\nand to come to him to-morrow, or when you can; and he wants to hear how\r\nAubrey is,\' continued Henry, as if dreamily repeating a lesson.\r\n\r\n\'He saw then--?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, and that seems to trouble him most.\'\r\n\r\nDr. May was past speaking, and Tom was obliged to answer for him--that\r\nAubrey was pretty well again, and had desired his dearest, dearest\r\nlove; then asked how Leonard was.\r\n\r\n\'Calm and firm as ever,\' said Henry, half choked.  \'Nothing seems to\r\nupset him, but speaking of--of you and Aubrey, Dr. May--and poor Ave.\r\nBut--but they\'ll be together before long.\'\r\n\r\n\'No such thing,\' said Dr. May.  \'You will see that certainty cures,\r\nwhen suspense kills; and for him, I\'ll never believe but that all will\r\nbe right yet.  Are you going home?\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall try to be with--with the dear unhappy boy as long as I can,\r\nand then I\'ll come home.\'\r\n\r\nDr. May grasped Henry\'s hand, gave a promise of coming, and a message\r\nof love to the prisoner, tried to say something more, but broke down,\r\nand let Tom lead him away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n      Under the shroud\r\n      Of His thunder-cloud\r\n  Lie we still when His voice is loud,\r\n      And our hearts shall feel\r\n      The love notes steal,\r\n  As a bird sings after the thunder peal--C. F. A.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot till dusk could Dr. May get back to Stoneborough, and then, in an\r\nevening gleam of that stormy day, he was met at the gate of Bankside by\r\nRichard and Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'You need not come in, papa,\' said Ethel.  \'She is asleep.  She knows.\'\r\n\r\nDr. May sighed with unspeakable relief.\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Bramshaw telegraphed, and his clerk came down.  It was not so very\r\nbad!  She saw it in our faces, and she was so worn out with talking and\r\nwatching, that--that the very turning her face to the wall with hope\r\nover, became sleep almost directly.\'\r\n\r\n\'That is well,\' murmured the Doctor.  \'And can you be spared, my dear?\r\nIf you could come I should be glad, for poor Aubrey is quite done up.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can come.  Mary is with her, and Richard will stay to meet Henry, if\r\nhe is coming home, or to send up if they want you; but I think she will\r\nnot wake for many hours; and then--oh! what can any one do!\'\r\n\r\nSo Richard turned back to the sorrowful house; and Dr. May, tenderly\r\ndrawing Ethel\'s arm into his own, told her, as they walked back, the\r\nfew incidents that she most wanted to hear, as best he could narrate\r\nthem.  \'You have had a heart-rending day, my dear,\' he said; \'you and\r\nMary, as well as the rest of us.\'\r\n\r\n\'There was one comfort!\' said Ethel, \'and that was his own notes. Ave\r\nhas all that he has written to her from Whitford under her pillow, and\r\nshe kept spreading them out, and making us read them, and--oh! their\r\nbraveness and cheeriness--they did quite seem to hold one up!  And then\r\npoor little Minna\'s constant little robin-chirp of faith, "God will not\r\nlet them hurt him."  One could not bear to tell the child, that though\r\nindeed they cannot hurt him, it may not be in her sense!  Look here!\r\nThese are her slippers.  She has worked on all day to finish them, that\r\nthey might be done and out of sight when he came home this evening.\r\nThe last stitch was done as Richard came in; and now I thought I could\r\nonly take them out of every one\'s sight.\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor things! poor things!  And how was it with the child when she\r\nheard?\'\r\n\r\n\'The old sweet note,\' said Ethel, less steadily than she had yet\r\nspoken, \'"nothing could hurt him for what he had not done."  I don\'t\r\nknow whether she knows what--what is in store.  At least she is not\r\nshaken yet, dear child.\'\r\n\r\n\'And Ave--how did you manage with her through all the day?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! we did as we could.  We tried reading the things Mr. Wilmot had\r\nmarked, but she was too restless; her hands would wander off to the\r\nletters, caressing them, and she would go back to talk of him--all his\r\nways from a baby upwards.  I hope there was no harm in letting her do\r\nit, for if there is anything to do one good, it is his noble spirit.\'\r\n\r\n\'If you had only seen his face to-day,\' exclaimed the Doctor, half\r\nangrily, \'you would not feel much comfort in the cutting off such a\r\nfellow.  No, no, it won\'t be.  We\'ll petition--petition--petition--and\r\nsave him, we will!  Minna will be right yet!  They shall not hurt him!\'\r\n\r\n\'Is there really hope in that way?\' said Ethel, and a quiver of relief\r\nagitated her whole frame.\r\n\r\n\'Every hope!  Every one I have seen, or Tom either, says so.  We have\r\nonly to draw up a strong enough representation of the facts, his\r\ncharacter, and all that; and there\'s his whole conduct before and since\r\nto speak for itself.  Why, when it was all over, George heard every one\r\nsaying, either he was a consummate hypocrite, or he must be innocent.\r\nHarvey Anderson declares the press will take it up.  We shall certainly\r\nget him off.\'\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t mean pardoned!\'\r\n\r\n\'Commutation of the penalty.  Come on,\' said the Doctor, hurrying at\r\nhis headlong pace, \'there\'s no time to be lost in getting it drawn up.\'\r\n\r\nEthel was dragged on so fast, that she could not speak; but it was with\r\nwilling haste, for this was the sort of suspense in which motion and\r\npurpose were a great relief after the day\'s weary waiting. Gertrude,\r\nquite spent with excitement and tears, had wisely betaken herself to\r\nbed; and it would have been well had Aubrey followed her example,\r\ninstead of wandering up and down the room in his misery, flushed though\r\nwan, impetuously talking treason against trial by jury, and abusing\r\ndignitaries.  They let him have it out, in all its fury and violence,\r\ntill he had tired out his first vehemence, and could be persuaded to\r\nlie on the sofa while the rough draught of the petition was drawn up,\r\nTom writing, and every one suggesting or discussing, till the Doctor,\r\ngetting thorough mastery over the subject, dictated so fluently and\r\nadmirably, that even Tom had not a word to gainsay, but observed to\r\nEthel, when his father had gone up to bed, and carried Aubrey off,\r\n\'What an exceedingly able man my father is!\'\r\n\r\n\'Is this the first time you have found that out?\' said Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'Why, you know it is not his nature to make the most of himself!  But\r\nstudying under him brings it out more; and there\'s a readiness about\r\nhim that I wish was catching.  But I say, Ethel, what\'s this?  I no\r\nmore doubt who did the deed, than I do who killed Abel; but I had once\r\nseen Cain\'s face, and I knew it again.  Is it true that the boy was\r\naware, and told my father?\'\r\n\r\n\'Did he tell you so?\'\r\n\r\n\'Only asked if he had betrayed the secret.  If they both know it--why,\r\nif it be Leonard\'s taste, I suppose I must say nothing to the contrary,\r\nbut he might as well consider his sister.\'\r\n\r\n\'What do you know, Tom?\' said she, perplexed.\r\n\r\n\'Only that there\'s some secret; and if it be as I am given to\r\nunderstand, then it is a frenzy that no lucid person should permit.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, Tom,\' said Ethel, feeling that the whole must be told, \'it is no\r\ncertainty--only unsupported suspicion, which he could not help telling\r\npapa after binding him on honour to make no use of it. Putting things\r\ntogether, he was sure who the man in the yard was; but it was not\r\nrecognition, and he could not have proved it.\'\r\n\r\n\'What Quixotry moved my father not to put the lawyers on the scent?\'\r\n\r\nEthel explained; and for her pains Tom fell upon her for her folly in\r\nnot having told him all, when he could have gone to Blewer and gathered\r\ninformation as no professional person could do; then lamented that he\r\nhad let Aubrey keep him from the inquest, when the fellow\'s hang-dog\r\nlook would have been sure to suggest to him to set Anderson to get him\r\nsearched.  Even now he would go to the mill, and try to hunt up\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n\'Tom, remember papa\'s promise!\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you think a man can do nothing without committing himself, like\r\npoor Aubrey?  No, Ethel, the Doctor may be clever, but that\'s no use if\r\na man is soft, and he is uncommonly soft; and you should not encourage\r\nhim in it.\'\r\n\r\nEthel was prevented from expressing useless indignation by the arrival\r\nof Mary, asking where papa was.\r\n\r\n\'Gone to bed.  He said he must go off at six to-morrow, there are so\r\nmany patients to see.  Ave does not want him, I hope?\'\r\n\r\nNo, she is still asleep; I was only waiting for Richard, and he had\r\ndreadful work with that poor Henry.\'\r\n\r\n\'What kind of work?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I believe it has all come on him now that it was his\r\nfault--driving Leonard to that place; and he was in such misery, that\r\nRichard could not leave him.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am glad he has the grace to feel it at last,\' said Tom.\r\n\r\n\'It must be very terrible!\' said Mary.  \'He says he cannot stay in that\r\nhouse, for every room reproaches him; and he groaned as if he was in\r\ntremendous bodily pain.\'\r\n\r\n\'What, you assisted at this scene?\' said Tom, looking at her rather\r\nsharply.\r\n\r\n\'No; but Richard told me; and I heard the groans as I sat on the\r\nstairs.\'\r\n\r\n\'Sat on the stairs?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  I could not go back to Ave\'s room for fear of waking her.\'\r\n\r\n\'And how long?\'\r\n\r\n\'Towards an hour, I believe.  I did all that piece,\' said Mary,\r\ndisplaying a couple of inches of a stocking leg, \'and I think it was\r\npretty well in the dark.\'\r\n\r\n\'Sitting on the stairs for an hour in the dark,\' said Tom, as he gave\r\nMary the candle he had been lighting for her.  \'That may be called\r\nunappreciated devotion.\'\r\n\r\n\'I never can tell what Tom means,\' said Mary, as she went up-stairs\r\nwith Ethel.  \'It was a very comfortable rest.  I wish you had had the\r\nsame, dear Ethel, you look so tired and worn out.  Let me stay and help\r\nyou.  It has been such a sad long day; and oh! how terrible this is!\r\nAnd you know him better than any of us, except Aubrey.\'\r\n\r\nMary stopped almost in dismay, for her sister, usually so firm, broke\r\ndown entirely, and sitting down on a low chair, threw an arm round her,\r\nand resting her weary brow against her, gave way to long tearless sobs,\r\nor rather catches of breath.  \'Oh! Mary! Mary!\' she said, between her\r\ngasps, \'to think of last year--and Coombe--and the two bright boys--and\r\nthe visions--and the light in those glorious eyes--and that this should\r\nbe the end!\'\r\n\r\n\'Dear, dear Ethel,\' said Mary, with fast-flowing tears and tender\r\ncaresses, \'you have kept us all up; you have always shown us it was for\r\nthe best.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is! it is!\' cried Ethel.  \'I do, I _will_ believe it!  If I had\r\nonly seen his face as papa tells of it, I could keep hold of the glory\r\nof it and the martyr spirit.  Now I only see his earnest, shy,\r\nconfiding look--and--and I don\'t know how to bear it.\'  And Ethel\'s\r\ngrasp of Mary in both arms was tightened, as if to support herself\r\nunder her deep labouring sobs of anguish.  Ah! he was very fond of you.\'\r\n\r\n\'There never was any one beyond our own selves that loved me so well. I\r\nalways knew it would not last--that it ought not; but oh! it was\r\nendearing; and I did think to have seen him a shining light!\'\r\n\r\n\'And don\'t you tell us he is a shining light now?\' said Mary, among the\r\ntears that really almost seemed to be a relief, as if her sister\r\nherself had shed them; and as she knelt down, Ethel laid her head on\r\nher shoulder, and spoke more calmly.\r\n\r\n\'He is,\' she said, \'and I ought to be thankful for it!  I think I am\r\ngenerally--but now--it makes it the more piteous--the hopes--the\r\nspirit--the determination--all to be quenched, and so quenched--and to\r\nhave nothing--nothing to do for him.\r\n\r\n\'But, Ethel, papa says your messages do him more good than anything;\r\nand papa will let you go and see him, and that will comfort him.\'\r\n\r\nEthel\'s lips gave a strange sort of smile; she thought it was at simple\r\nMary\'s trust in her power, but it would hardly have been there but for\r\nthe species of hope thus excited, and the sense of sympathy. Mary was\r\nnot one to place any misconstruction on what had passed; she well knew\r\nthat Leonard had almost taken a brother\'s place in Ethel\'s heart, and\r\nshe prized him at the rate of her sister\'s esteem. Perhaps her\r\nprominent thought was how cruel were those who fancied that Ethel\'s\r\nlofty faith was unfeeling, and how very good Leonard must be to be thus\r\nmourned.  At any rate, she was an excellent comforter, in the sympathy\r\nthat was neither too acute nor too obtuse; and purely to oblige her,\r\nEthel for the first time submitted to her favourite panacea of hair\r\nbrushing, and found that in very truth those soft and steady\r\nmanipulations were almost mesmeric in soothing away the hard oppressive\r\nexcitement, and bringing on a gentle and slumberous resignation.\r\n\r\nThe sisters were early astir next morning, to inflict on their father a\r\ncup of cocoa, which he rebelled against, but swallowed, and to receive\r\nhis last orders, chiefly consisting of messages to Tom about taking the\r\npetition to be approved of by Dr. Spencer and others, and then having\r\nit properly drawn out.  Mary asked if women might sign it, and was\r\nanswered with an impatient \'Pshaw!\'\r\n\r\n\'But ladies do have petitions of their own,\' said Mary, with some\r\ndiffidence.  \'Could not we have one?\'\r\n\r\nHis lips were compressed for another \'Pshaw,\' when he bethought\r\nhimself.  \'Well, I don\'t know--the more the better.  Only it won\'t do\r\nfor you to set it going.  Flora must be the woman for that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, then,\' cried Mary, eagerly, \'might not I walk over to breakfast at\r\nthe Grange, and talk to Flora?  Ethel, you would not mind going to Ave\r\ninstead?  Or will you go to Flora?\'\r\n\r\n\'You had better,\' said Ethel.  \'I must stay on Aubrey\'s account; and\r\nthis is your doing, Mary,\' she added, looking at her warmly.\r\n\r\n\'Then put on your hat, Mary, and take a biscuit,\' said the Doctor, \'and\r\nyou shall have a lift as far as the cross roads.\'\r\n\r\nThus the morning began with action and with hope.  Mary found herself\r\nvery welcome at the Grange, where there was much anxiety to hear of\r\nAubrey, as well as the more immediate sufferers.  The Riverses had\r\ndined at Drydale, and had met the judges, as well as a good many of the\r\ncounty gentlemen who had been on the grand jury and attended on the\r\ntrial.  They had found every one most deeply touched by the conduct of\r\nthe prisoner.  The judge had talked to Flora about her young brother,\r\nand the friendship so bravely avouched; had asked the particulars of\r\nthe action to which Leonard had alluded, and shown himself much\r\ninterested in all that she related.\r\n\r\nShe said that the universal impression was that the evidence was dead\r\nagainst Leonard, and taken apart, led to such conviction of his guilt,\r\nthat no one could wonder at the verdict; but that his appearance and\r\nmanner were such, that it was almost impossible, under their influence,\r\nnot to credit his innocence.  She had reason to believe that petitions\r\nwere already in hand both from the county and the assize town, and she\r\neagerly caught at Mary\'s proposal of one from the ladies of\r\nStoneborough.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll drive in at once before luncheon, and take you home, Mary,\' she\r\nsaid.  \'And, first of all, we will begin with the two widows, and half\r\nthe battle will be won.\'\r\n\r\nNay, more than half the battle proved to be already gained in that\r\nquarter.  The writing-table was covered with sheets of foolscap, and\r\nMrs. Pugh was hard at work copying the petition which Mr. Harvey\r\nAnderson had kindly assisted in composing, and which the aunt and niece\r\nhad intended to have brought to the Grange for Mrs. Rivers\'s approval\r\nthat very day.  Harvey Anderson had spent the evening at Mrs. Ledwich\'s\r\nin drawing it up, and giving his advice; and Flora, going over it word\r\nfor word with Mrs. Pugh, felt that it could hardly have been better\r\nworded.\r\n\r\n\'He is a very clever, a very rising young man, and so feeling, said\r\nMrs. Ledwich to Mary while this was going on.  \'In fact, he is a\r\nperfect knight-errant on this subject.  He is gone to London this\r\nmorning to see what can be done by means of the press.  I tell Matilda\r\nit is quite a romance of modern life; and indeed, the sweet girl is\r\nvery romantic still--very young, even after all she has gone through.\'\r\n\r\nNot understanding this, Mary let it pass in calculations on the number\r\nof possible signatures, which the two ladies undertook to collect.\r\n\r\n\'That is well,\' said Flora, as they went away.  \'It could not be in\r\nbetter hands.  It will thrive the better for our doing nothing but\r\nwriting our names.\'\r\n\r\nThey met Tom on the like errand, but not very sanguine, for he said\r\nthere had of late been an outcry against the number of reprieves\r\ngranted, and the public had begun to think itself not sufficiently\r\nprotected.  He thought the best chance was the discovery of some\r\nadditional fact that might tell in favour of Leonard, and confident in\r\nhis own sagacity, was going to make perquisitions at the mill. Every\r\none had been visiting of late, and now that he knew more, if he and his\r\nmicroscope could detect one drop of human blood in an unexpected place,\r\nthey would do better service to the prisoner than all the petitions\r\nthat could be signed.\r\n\r\nAveril was somewhat better; the feverishness had been removed by her\r\nlong sleep of despair, and her energy revived under the bodily relief,\r\nand the fixed purpose of recovering in time to see her brother again;\r\nbut the improvement was not yet trusted by Henry, who feared her doing\r\ntoo much unless he was himself watching over her, and therefore only\r\npaid Leonard a short visit in the forenoon, going and returning by\r\nearly trains.\r\n\r\nHe reported that Leonard was very pale, and owned to want of sleep,\r\nadding, however, \'It does not matter.  Why should I wish to lose any\r\ntime?\'  Calm and brave as ever, he had conversed as cheerfully as\r\nHenry\'s misery would permit, inquiring into the plans of the family,\r\nwhich he knew were to depend on his fate, and acquiescing in his\r\nbrother\'s intention of quitting the country; nay, even suggesting that\r\nit might be better for his sisters to be taken away before all was\r\nover, though he, as well as Henry, knew that to this Averil would never\r\nhave consented.  He had always been a great reader of travels, and he\r\nbecame absolutely eager in planning their life in the wild, as if where\r\nthey were he must be, till the casual mention of the word \'rifle\'\r\nbrought him to sudden silence, and the consciousness of the condemned\r\ncell; but even then it was only to be urgent in consoling his brother,\r\nand crowding message on message for his sisters; begging Henry not to\r\nstay, not to consider him for a moment, but only whatever might be best\r\nfor Ave.\r\n\r\nIn this frame Henry had left him, and late in the afternoon, Dr. May\r\nhad contrived to despatch his work and make his way to the jail, where,\r\nas he entered, he encountered the chaplain, Mr. Reeve, a very worthy,\r\nbut not a very acute man.  Pausing to inquire for the prisoner, he was\r\nmet by a look of oppression and perplexity.  The chaplain had been with\r\nyoung Ward yesterday evening, and was only just leaving him; but then,\r\ninstead of the admiring words the Doctor expected, there only came a\r\ncomplaint of the difficulty of dealing with him; so well instructed, so\r\nrespectful in manner, and yet there was a coldness, a hardness about\r\nhim, amounting to sullenness, rejecting all attempts to gain his\r\nconfidence, or bring him to confession.\r\n\r\nDr. May had almost been angry, but he bethought himself in time that\r\nthe chaplain was bound to believe the verdict of the court; and\r\nbesides, the good man looked so grieved and pitiful, that it was\r\nimpossible to be displeased with him, especially when he began to hope\r\nthat the poor youth might be less reserved with a person who knew him\r\nbetter, and to consult Dr. May which of the Stoneborough clergy had\r\nbetter be written to as likely to be influential with him. Dr. May\r\nrecommended Mr. Wilmot, as having visited the boy in his illness, as\r\nwell as prepared him for Confirmation; and then, with a heavier load of\r\nsadness on his heart, followed the turnkey on his melancholy way.\r\n\r\nWhen the door was opened, he saw Leonard sitting listlessly on the side\r\nof his bed, resting his head on his hand, entirely unoccupied; but at\r\nthe first perception who his visitor was, he sprang to his feet, and\r\ncoming within the arms held out to him, rested his head on the kind\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\'My dear boy--my brave fellow,\' said Dr. May, \'you got through\r\nyesterday nobly.\'\r\n\r\nThere was none either of the calmness or the reserve of which Dr. May\r\nhad been told, in the hot hands that were wringing his own, nor in the\r\nchoking struggling voice that tried to make the words clear--\'Thank you\r\nfor what you said--And dear Aubrey--how is he?\'\r\n\r\n\'I came away at six, before he was awake,\' said the Doctor; \'but he\r\nwill not be the worse for it, never fear!  I hope his evidence was less\r\ntrying than you and he expected.\'\r\n\r\nLeonard half smiled.  \'I had forgotten that,\' he said, \'it was so long\r\nago!  No, indeed--the dear fellow was--like a bright spot in that\r\nday--only--only it brought back all we were--all that is gone for ever.\'\r\n\r\nThe tenderness of one whom he did not feel bound to uphold like his\r\nbrother had produced the outbreak that could not fail to come to so\r\nwarm, open, and sensitive a nature, and at such an age.  He was bold\r\nand full of fortitude in the front of the ordeal, and solitude pent up\r\nhis feelings, but the fatherly sympathy and perfect confidence drew\r\nforth expression, and a vent once opened, the rush of emotion and\r\nanguish long repressed was utterly overpowering.  His youthful manhood\r\nstruggled hard, but the strangled sobs only shook his frame the more\r\nconvulsively, and the tears burnt like drops of fire, as they fell\r\namong the fingers that he spread over his face in the agony of weeping\r\nfor his young vigorous life, his blasted hopes, the wretchedness he\r\ncaused, the disgrace of his name.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t, don\'t fight against it,\' said Dr. May, affectionately drawing\r\nhim to his seat on the bed, as, indeed, the violence of the paroxysm\r\nmade him scarcely able to stand.  \'Let it have its way; you will be all\r\nthe better for it.  It ought to be so--it must.\'\r\n\r\nAnd in tears himself, the Doctor turned his back, and went as far away\r\nas the cell would permit, turning towards the books that lay on a\r\nnarrow ledge that served for a table.  \'How long, O Lord, how long?\'\r\nwere the words that caught his eye in the open Psalms; and, startled as\r\nif at unauthorized prying, he looked up at the dull screened and spiked\r\nwindow above his head, till he knew by the sounds that the worst of the\r\nuncontrollable passion had spent itself, and then he came back with the\r\ntowel dipped in water, and cooled the flushed heated face as a sister\r\nmight have done.\r\n\r\n\'Oh--thank you--I am ashamed,\' gasped the still sobbing boy.\r\n\r\n\'Ashamed!  No; I like you the better for it,\' said the Doctor,\r\nearnestly.  \'There is no need that we should not grieve together in\r\nthis great affliction, and say out all that is in our hearts.\'\r\n\r\n\'All!\' exclaimed Leonard.  \'No--no words can say that!  Oh! was it for\r\nsuch as this that my poor mother made so much of me--and I got through\r\nthe fever--and I hoped--and I strove--Why--why should I be cut off--for\r\na disgrace and a misery to all! and again came the heart-broken sobs,\r\nthough less violently.\r\n\r\n\'Not to those who look within, and honour you, Leonard.\'\r\n\r\n\'Within!  Why, how bad I have been, since _this_ is the reckoning!  I\r\ndeserve it, I know--but--\' and his voice again sank in tears.\r\n\r\n\'Ethel says that your so feeling comforts her the most; to know that\r\nyou have not the terrible struggle of faith disturbed by injustice.\'\r\n\r\n\'If--I have not,\' said Leonard, \'it is her doing.  In those happy days\r\nwhen we read Marmion, and could not believe that God would not always\r\nshow the right, she showed me how we only see bits and scraps of His\r\nJustice here, and it works round in the end!  Nay, if I had not done\r\nthat thing to Henry, I should not be here now!  It is right! It is\r\nright!\' he exclaimed between the heaving sobs that still recurred.  \'I\r\ndo try to keep before me what she said about Job--when it comes burning\r\nbefore me, why should that man be at large, and I here? or when I think\r\nhow his serpent-eye fell under mine when I tried that one word about\r\nthe receipt, that would save my life.  Oh! that receipt!\'\r\n\r\n\'Better to be here than in his place, after all!\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'d rather be a street-sweeper!\' bitterly began Leonard.--\'Oh, Dr.\r\nMay, do let me have that!\' he cried, suddenly changing his tone, and\r\nholding out his hand, as he perceived in the Doctor\'s button-hole a\r\ndove-pink, presented at a cottage door by a grateful patient.  For a\r\nspace he was entirely occupied with gazing into its crimson depths,\r\ninhaling the fragrance, and caressingly spreading the cool damask\r\npetals against his hot cheeks and eyelids.  \'It is so long since I saw\r\nanything but walls!\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'Three weeks,\' sadly replied the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\'There was a gleam of sunshine when I got out of the van yesterday. I\r\nnever knew before what sunshine was.  I hope it will be a sunny day\r\nwhen I go out for the last time!\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear boy, I have good hopes of saving you.  There\'s not a creature\r\nin Stoneborough, or round it, that is not going to petition for\r\nyou--and at your age--\'\r\n\r\nLeonard shook his head in dejection.  \'It has all gone against me,\' he\r\nsaid.  \'They all say there\'s no chance.  The chaplain says it is of no\r\nuse unsettling my mind.\'\r\n\r\n\'The chaplain is an old--\' began Dr. May, catching himself up only just\r\nin time, and asking, \'How do you get on with him!\'\r\n\r\n\'I can hear him read,\' said Leonard, with the look that had been\r\nthought sullen.\r\n\r\n\'But you cannot talk to him?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not while he thinks me guilty.\'  Then, at a sound of warm sympathy\r\nfrom his friend, he added, \'I suppose it is his duty; but I wish he\r\nwould keep away.  I can\'t stand his aiming at making me confess, and I\r\ndon\'t want to be disrespectful.\'\r\n\r\n\'I see, I see.  It cannot be otherwise.  But how would it be if Wilmot\r\ncame to you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Would Mr. May?\' said Leonard, with a beseeching look.\r\n\r\n\'Richard?  He would with all his heart; but I think you would find more\r\nsupport and comfort in a man of Mr. Wilmot\'s age and experience, and\r\nthat Mr. Reeve would have more trust in him; but it shall be exactly as\r\nwill be most comforting to you.\'\r\n\r\n\'If Mr. Wilmot would be so good, then\' said Leonard, meekly. \'Indeed, I\r\nwant help to bear it patiently!  I don\'t know how to die; and yet it\r\nseemed not near so hard a year ago, when they thought I did not notice,\r\nand I heard Ave go away crying, and my mother murmuring, again and\r\nagain, "Thy will be done!"--the last time I heard her voice.  Oh, well\r\nthat she has not to say it now!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well that her son can say it!\'\r\n\r\n\'I want to be able to say it,\' said the boy, fervently; \'but this seems\r\nso hard--life is so sweet.\'  Then, after a minute\'s thought: \'Dr. May,\r\nthat morning, when I awoke, and asked you for them--papa and mamma--you\r\nknelt down and said the Lord\'s Prayer.  Won\'t you now?\'\r\n\r\nAnd when those words had been said, and they both stood up again,\r\nLeonard added: \'It always seems to mean more and more!  But oh, Dr.\r\nMay! that forgiving--I can\'t ask any one but you if--\' and he paused.\r\n\r\n\'If you forgive, my poor boy!  Nay, are not your very silence and\r\nforbearance signs of practical forgiveness?  Besides, I have always\r\nobserved that you have never used one of the epithets that I can\'t\r\nthink of him without.\'\r\n\r\n\'Some feelings are too strong for common words of abuse,\' said Leonard,\r\nalmost smiling; \'but I hope I may be helped to put away what is\r\nwrong.--Oh, must you go?\'\r\n\r\n\'I fear I must, my dear; I have a patient to see again, on my way back,\r\nand one that will be the worse for waiting.\'\r\n\r\n\'Henry has not been able to practise.  I want to ask one thing, Dr.\r\nMay, before you go.  Could not you persuade them, since home is\r\npoisoned to them, at any rate to go at once?  It would be better for my\r\nsisters than being here--when--and they would only remember that last\r\nSunday at home.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you shrink from another meeting with Averil?\'\r\n\r\nHis face was forced into calmness.  \'I will do without it, if it would\r\nhurt her.\'\r\n\r\n\'It may for the time, but to be withheld would give her a worse\r\nheart-ache through life.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, thank you!\' cried Leonard, his face lighting up; \'it is something\r\nstill to hope for.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nay, I\'ve not given you up yet,\' said the Doctor, trying for a\r\ncheerful smile.  \'I\'ve got a prescription that will bring you through\r\nyet--London advice, you know.  I\'ve great faith in the consulting\r\nsurgeon at the Home Office.\'\r\n\r\nBy the help of that smile and augury, the Doctor got away, terribly\r\nbeaten down, but living on his fragment of hope; though obliged to\r\nperceive that every one who merely saw the newspaper report in black\r\nand white, without coming into personal contact with the prisoner,\r\ncould not understand how the slightest question of the justice of the\r\nverdict could arise.  Even Mr. Wilmot was so convinced by the papers,\r\nthat the Doctor almost repented of the mission to which he had invited\r\nhim, and would, if he could, have revoked what had been said. But the\r\nvicar of Stoneborough, painful as was the duty, felt his post to be by\r\nthe side of his unhappy young parishioner, equally whether the gaol\r\nchaplain or Dr. May were right, and if he had to bring him to\r\nconfession, or to strengthen him to \'endure grief, suffering\r\nwrongfully.\'\r\n\r\nAnd after the first interview, no more doubts on that score were\r\nexpressed; but the vicar\'s tone of pitying reverence in speaking of the\r\nprisoner was like that of his friends in the High Street.\r\n\r\nTom May spared neither time nor pains in beating up for signatures for\r\nthe petition, but he had a more defined hope, namely, that of detecting\r\nsomething that might throw the suspicion into the right quarter.  The\r\nleast contradiction of the evidence might raise a doubt that would save\r\nLeonard\'s life, and bring the true criminal in peril of the fate he so\r\nrichly deserved.  The Vintry Mill was the lion of the neighbourhood,\r\nand the crowds of visitors had been a reason for its new master\'s\r\nvacating it, and going into lodgings in Whitford; so that Tom, when he\r\nfound it convenient to forget his contempt of the gazers and curiosity\r\nhunters who thronged there, and to march off on a secret expedition of\r\ninvestigation, found no obstacle in his way, and at the cost of a fee\r\nto Mrs. Giles, who was making a fortune, was free to roam and search\r\nwherever he pleased.  Even his careful examination of the cotton blind,\r\nand his scraping of the window-sill with a knife, were not remarked;\r\nfor had not the great chair been hacked into fragmentary relics, and\r\nthe loose paper of the walls of Leonard\'s room been made mincemeat of,\r\nas memorials of \'the murderer, Ward\'?\r\n\r\nOne long white hair picked out of a mat below the window, and these\r\nscrapings of the window-sill, Tom carried off, and also the scrapings\r\nof the top bar of a stile between the mill and the Three Goblets. That\r\nevening, all were submitted to the microscope.  Dr. May was waked from\r\na doze by a very deferential \'I beg your pardon, sir,\' and a sudden\r\ntweak, which abstracted a silver thread from his head; and Mab showed\r\nsomewhat greater displeasure at a similar act of plunder upon her white\r\nchemisette.  But the spying was followed by a sigh; and, in dumb show,\r\nEthel was made to perceive that the Vintry hair had more affinity with\r\nthe canine than the human.  As to the scrapings of the window, nothing\r\nbut vegetable fibre could there be detected; but on the stile, there\r\nwas undoubtedly a mark containing human blood-disks; Tom proved that\r\nboth by comparison with his books, and by pricking his own finger, and\r\nkept Ethel to see it after every one else was gone up to bed.  But as\r\none person\'s blood was like another\'s, who could tell whether some one\r\nwith a cut finger had not been through the stile?  Tom shook his head,\r\nthere was not yet enough on which to commit himself.  \'But I\'ll have\r\nhim!--I\'ll have him yet!\' said he.  \'I\'ll never rest while that villain\r\nwalks the earth unpunished!\'\r\n\r\nMeantime, Harvey Anderson did yeoman\'s service by a really powerful\r\narticle in a leading paper, written from the very heart of an able man,\r\nwho had been strongly affected himself, and was well practised in\r\nfeeling in pen and ink.  Every word rang home to the soul, and all the\r\nmore because there was no defence nor declamation against the justice\r\nof the verdict, which was acknowledged to be unavoidable; it was merely\r\na pathetic delineation of a terrible mystery, with a little meditative\r\nphilosophy upon it, the moral of which was, that nothing is more\r\ndelusive than fact, more untrue than truth.  However, it was copied\r\neverywhere, and had the great effect of making it the cue of more than\r\nhalf the press to mourn over, rather than condemn, \'the unfortunate\r\nyoung gentleman.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Pugh showed every one the article, and confided to most that she\r\nhad absolutely ventured to suggest two or three of the sentences. But a\r\ngreat deal might be borne from Mrs. Pugh, in consideration of her\r\nindefatigable exertions with the ladies\' petition, and it was a decided\r\nsuccess.  The last census had rated Market Stoneborough at 7561\r\ninhabitants, and Mrs. Pugh\'s petition bore no less than 3024 female\r\nnames, in which she fairly beat that of the mayor; but then she had\r\nbeen less scrupulous as to the age at which people should be asked to\r\nsign; as long as the name could be written at all, she was not\r\nparticular whose it was.\r\n\r\nDr. May made his patients agree to accept as his substitute Dr. Spencer\r\nor Mr. Wright, to whom Henry Ward intended to resign practice and\r\nhouse.  He himself was to go to London for a couple of nights with\r\nGeorge Rivers, who was exceedingly gratified at having the charge of\r\nhim all to himself, and considered that the united influence of member\r\nand mayor must prevail.  Dr. Spencer, on the contrary, probably by way\r\nof warning, represented Mr. Mayor as ruining everything by his headlong\r\nway of setting about it, declaring that he would abuse everybody all\r\nround, and assure the Home Secretary, that, as sure as his name was\r\nDick May, it was quite impossible the boy could have hurt a fly; though\r\na strict sense of truth would lead him to add the next moment, that he\r\nwas terribly passionate, and had nearly demolished his brother.\r\n\r\nDr. May talked of his caution and good behaviour, which, maybe, were\r\nsomewhat increased by this caricature, but he ended by very hearty\r\nwishes that these were the times of Jeanie Deans; if the pardon\r\ndepended on our own good Queen, he should not doubt of it a moment.\r\nWhy, was not the boy just the age of her own son?\r\n\r\nAnd verily there was no one in the whole world whom poor Averil envied\r\nlike Jeanie Deans.\r\n\r\nSo member and mayor went to London together, and intense were the\r\nprayers that speeded them and followed them.  The case was laid before\r\nthe Home Secretary, the petitions presented, and Dr. May said all that\r\nman might say on ground where he felt as if over-partisanship might be\r\nperilous.  The matter was to have due consideration: nothing more\r\ndefinite or hopeful could be obtained; but there could be no doubt that\r\nthis meant a real and calm re-weighing of the evidence, with a\r\nconsideration of all the circumstances.  It was something for the\r\nDoctor that a second dispassionate study should be given to the case,\r\nbut his heart sank as he thought of that cold, hard statement of\r\nevidence, without the counter testimony of the honest, tearless eyes\r\nand simple good faith of the voice and tone.\r\n\r\nAnd when he entered the railway carriage on his road home, the\r\nnewspaper that George Rivers attentively pressed upon him bore the\r\ninformation that Wednesday, the 21st, would be the day, according to\r\nusage, for the execution of the condemned criminal, Leonard Axworthy\r\nWard.  If it had been for the execution of Richard May, the Doctor\r\ncould hardly have given a deeper groan.\r\n\r\nHe left the train at the county town.  He had so arranged, that he\r\nmight see the prisoner on his way home; but he had hardly the heart to\r\ngo, except that he knew he was expected, and no disappointment that he\r\ncould help must add to the pangs of these last days.\r\n\r\nLeonard was alone, but was not, as before, sitting unemployed; he\r\ncarefully laid down his etching work ere he came forward to meet his\r\nfriend; and there was not the bowed and broken look about him, but a\r\nfixed calmness and resolution, as he claimed the fatherly embrace and\r\nblessing with which the Doctor now always met him.\r\n\r\n\'I bring you no certainty, Leonard.  It is under consideration.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you.  You have done everything,\' returned Leonard, quietly;\r\n\'and--\' then pausing, he added, \'I know the day now--the day after my\r\nbirthday.\'\r\n\r\n\'Let us--let us hope,\' said the Doctor, greatly agitated.\r\n\r\n\'Thank you,\' again said Leonard; and there was a pause, during which\r\nDr. May anxiously studied the face, which had become as pale and almost\r\nas thin as when the lad had been sent off to Coombe, and infinitely\r\nolder in the calm steadfastness of every feature.\r\n\r\n\'You do not look well, Leonard.\'\r\n\r\n\'No; I am not quite well; but it matters very little,\' he said, with a\r\nsmile.  \'I am well enough to make it hard to believe how soon all sense\r\nand motion will be gone out of these fingers!\' and he held up his hand,\r\nand studied the minutiae of its movements with a strange grave sort of\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t--don\'t, Leonard!\' exclaimed the Doctor.  \'You may be able to\r\nbear it, but I cannot.\'\r\n\r\n\'I thought you would not mind, you have so often watched death.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; but--\' and he covered his face with his hands.\r\n\r\n\'I wish it did not pain you all so much,\' said Leonard, quietly. \'But\r\nfor that, I can feel it to be better than if I had gone in the fever,\r\nwhen I had no sense to think or repent; or if I had--I hardly knew my\r\nown faults.\'\r\n\r\n\'You seem much happier now, my boy.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Leonard.  \'I am more used to the notion, and Mr. Wilmot has\r\nbeen so kind.  Then I am to see Ave to-morrow, if she is well enough.\r\nHenry has promised to bring her, and leave her alone with me; and I do\r\nhope--that I shall be able to convince her that it is not so very bad\r\nfor me--and then she may be able to take comfort. You know she would,\r\nif she were nursing me now in my bed at Bankside; so why should she not\r\nwhen she sees that I don\'t think this any worse, but rather better?\'\r\n\r\nThe Doctor was in no mood to think any comfort possible in thus losing\r\none like Leonard, and he did not commit himself to an untruth. There\r\nwas a silence again, and Leonard opened his book, and took out his\r\netchings, one which he had already promised the Doctor, another for\r\nAubrey, and at the third the Doctor exclaimed inarticulately with\r\nsurprise and admiration.\r\n\r\nIt was a copy of the well-known Cross-bearing Form in the Magdalen\r\nCollege Chapel Altar-piece, drawn in pen and ink on a half-sheet of\r\nthick note-paper; but somehow, into the entire Face and Figure there\r\nwas infused such an expression as now and then comes direct from the\r\nsoul of the draughtsman--an inspiration entirely independent of manual\r\ndexterity, and that copies, however exact, fail to render, nay, which\r\nthe artist himself fails to renew.  The beauty, the meekness, the\r\nhidden Majesty of the Countenance, were conveyed in a marvellous\r\nmanner, and were such as would bring a tear to the eye of the gazer,\r\neven had the drawing been there alone to speak for itself.\r\n\r\n\'This is your doing, Leonard?\'\r\n\r\n\'I have just finished it.  It has been one of my greatest comforts--\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah!\'\r\n\r\n\'Doing those lines;\' and he pointed to the thorny Crown, \'I seem to get\r\nashamed of thinking this hardness.  Only think, Dr. May, from the very\r\nfirst moment the policeman took me in charge, nobody has said a rough\r\nword to me.  I have never felt otherwise than that they meant justice\r\nto have its way as far as they knew, but they were all consideration\r\nfor me.  To think of that, and then go over the scoffs and\r\nscourgings!\'--there was a bright glistening tear in Leonard\'s eye\r\nnow--\'it seems like child\'s play to go through such a trial as mine.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes! you have found the secret of willingness.\'\r\n\r\n\'And,\' added the boy, hesitating between the words, but feeling that he\r\nmust speak them, as the best balm for the sorrow he was causing, \'even\r\nmy little touch of the shame and scorn of this does make me know better\r\nwhat it must have been, and yet--so thankful when I remember why it\r\nwas--that I think I could gladly bear a great deal more than this is\r\nlikely to be.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! my boy, I have no fears for you now.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes--have fears,\' cried Leonard, hastily.  \'Pray for me!  You\r\ndon\'t know what it is to wake up at night, and know something is coming\r\nnearer and nearer--and then this--before one can remember all that\r\nblesses it--or the Night of that Agony--and that He knows what it is--\'\r\n\r\n\'Do we not pray for you?\' said Dr. May, fervently, \'in church and at\r\nhome? and is not this an answer?  Am I to take this drawing, Leonard,\r\nthat speaks so much?\'\r\n\r\n\'If--if you think Miss May--would let me send it to her?  Thank you, it\r\nwill be very kind of her.  And please tell her, if it had not been for\r\nthat time at Coombe, I don\'t know how I could ever have felt the ground\r\nunder my feet.  If I have one wish that never can be--\'\r\n\r\n\'What wish, my dear, dear boy?  Don\'t be afraid to say.  Is it to see\r\nher?\'\r\n\r\n\'It was,\' said Leonard, \'but I did not mean to say it.  I know it\r\ncannot be.\'\r\n\r\n\'But, Leonard, she has said that if you wished it, she would come as if\r\nyou were lying on your bed at home, and with more reverence.\'\r\n\r\nLarge tears of gratitude were swelling in Leonard\'s eyes, and he\r\npressed the Doctor\'s hand, but still said, almost inarticulately,\r\n\'Ought she?\'\r\n\r\n\'I will bring her, my boy.  It will do her good to see how--how her\r\npupil, as they have always called you in joke, Leonard, can be willing\r\nto bear the Cross after his Master.  She has never let go for a moment\r\nthe trust that it was well with you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! Dr. May, it was the one thing--and when I had gone against all her\r\nwishes.  It is so good of her!  It is the one thing--\' and there was no\r\ndoubt from his face that he was indeed happy.\r\n\r\nAnd Dr. May went home that day softened and almost cheered, well-nigh\r\nas though he had had a promise of Leonard\'s life, and convinced that in\r\nthe region to which the spirits of Ethel and her pupil could mount,\r\nresignation would silence the wailings of grief and sorrow; the things\r\ninvisible were more than a remedy for the things visible.\r\n\r\nThat Ethel should see Leonard before the last, he was quite resolved;\r\nand Ethel, finding that so it was, left the _when_ in his hands,\r\nknowing the concession to be so great, that it must be met by grateful\r\npatience on her own side, treasuring the drawing meanwhile with\r\nfeelings beyond speech.  Dr. May did not wish the meeting to take place\r\ntill he was really sure that all hope was at an end; he knew it would\r\nbe a strong measure, and though he did not greatly care for the world\r\nin general, he did not want to offend Flora unnecessarily; in matters\r\nof propriety she was a little bit of a conscience to him, and though he\r\nwould brave her or any one else when a thing was right, especially if\r\nit were to give one last moment of joy to Leonard, she was not to be\r\nset at naught till the utmost extremity.\r\n\r\nAnd for one day, the sight of Averil would be enough.  She had\r\nstruggled into something sufficiently like recovery to be able to\r\nmaintain her fitness for the exertion; and Henry had recognized that\r\nthe unsatisfied pining was so preying on her as to hurt her more than\r\nthe meeting and parting could do, since, little as he could understand\r\nhow it was, he perceived that Leonard could be depended on for support\r\nand comfort.  With him, indeed, Leonard had ever shown himself cheerful\r\nand resolute, speaking of anything rather than of himself and never\r\ngrieving him with the sight of those failings of flesh and heart that\r\nwould break forth where there was more congenial sympathy, yet where\r\nthey were not a reproach.\r\n\r\nSo Averil, with many a promise to be \'good,\' and strongly impressed\r\nwith warnings that the chance of another meeting depended on the\r\neffects of this one, was laid back in the carriage, leaving poor little\r\nMinna to Mary\'s consolation.  Minna was longing to go too, but Henry\r\nhad forbidden it, and not even an appeal to Dr. May had prevailed; so\r\nshe was taken home by Mary, and with a child\'s touching patience, was\r\nhelped through the weary hours, giving wandering though gentle\r\nattention to Ella\'s eager display of the curiosities of the place, and\r\nexplanations of the curious games and puzzles taught by \'Mr. Tom.\'\r\nEthel, watching the sweet wistful face, and hearing the subdued voice,\r\nfelt a reverence towards the child, as though somewhat of the shadow of\r\nher brother\'s cross had fallen on her.\r\n\r\nThe elder brother and sister meanwhile arrived at the building now only\r\ntoo familiar to one of them, and, under her thick veil, unconscious of\r\nthe pitying looks of the officials, Averil was led, leaning on Henry\'s\r\narm, along the whitewashed passages, with their slate floors, and up\r\nthe iron stairs, the clear, hard, light coldness chilling her heart\r\nwith a sense of the stern, relentless, inevitable grasp in which the\r\nvictim was held.  The narrow iron door flew open at the touch of the\r\nturnkey; a hand was on her arm, but all swam round with her, and she\r\nonly knew it was the well-known voice; she did not follow the words\r\nbetween her brothers and the turnkey about the time she was to be left\r\nthere, but she gave a start and shudder when the door sprung fast again\r\nbehind her, and at the same instant she felt herself upheld by an arm\r\nround her waist.\r\n\r\n\'Take off your bonnet, Ave; let me see you,\' he said, himself undoing\r\nthe strings, and removing it, then bending his face to hers for a long,\r\nalmost insatiable kiss, as they stood strained in one intense embrace,\r\nall in perfect silence on the sister\'s part.\r\n\r\n\'I have been making ready for you,\' he said at length, partly releasing\r\nher; \'you are to sit here;\' and he deposited her, still perfectly\r\npassive in his hands, upon his bed, her back against the wall.  \'Put up\r\nyour feet!  There!\'  And having settled her to his satisfaction, he\r\nknelt down on the floor, one arm round her waist, one hand in hers,\r\nlooking earnestly up into her face, with his soul in his eyes, her\r\nother hand resting on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\'How are the little ones, Ave?\'\r\n\r\n\'Very well.  Minna so longed to come.\'\r\n\r\n\'Better not,\' said Leonard; \'she is so little, and these white walls\r\nmight distress her fancy.  They will remember our singing on the last\r\nSunday evening instead.  Do you remember, Ave, how they begged to stay\r\non and on till it grew so dark that we could not see a word or a note,\r\nand went on from memory?\' and he very softly hummed the restful\r\ncadence, dying away into\r\n\r\n  \'Till in the ocean of Thy love\r\n  We lose ourselves in Heaven above.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\'How can you bear to think of those dear happy days!\'\r\n\r\n\'Because you will be glad of them by and by, said Leonard; \'and I am\r\nvery glad of them now, though they might have been so much better, if\r\nonly we had known.\'\r\n\r\n\'They were the only happy days of all my life!\'\r\n\r\n\'I hope not--I trust not, dearest.  You may and ought to have much\r\nbetter and happier days to come.\'\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, with a look of inexpressible anguish, almost of\r\nreproach.\r\n\r\n\'Indeed I mean it, Ave,\' he said; \'I have thought it over many times,\r\nand I see that the discomfort and evil of our home was in the spirit of\r\npride and rebellion that I helped you to nurse.  It was like a wedge,\r\ndriving us farther and farther apart; and now that it is gone, and you\r\nwill close up again, when you are kind and yielding to Henry--what a\r\nhappy peaceful home you may make out in the prairie land!\'\r\n\r\n\'As if we could ever--\'\r\n\r\n\'Nay, Averil, could not you recover it if I were dying now of sickness?\r\nI know you would, though you might not think so at the time.  Believe\r\nme, then, when I say that I am quite willing to have it as it is--to be\r\nmy own man to the last--to meet with such precious inestimable kindness\r\nfrom so many.  Of course I should like to live longer, and do something\r\nworth doing; but if I am to die young, there is so much blessing even\r\nin this way, that nothing really grieves me but the thought of you and\r\nHenry; and if it makes you one together, even that is made up.\'\r\n\r\nAwe-struck, and as if dreaming, she did not answer, only smoothing\r\ncaressingly the long waves of bright brown hair on his forehead.  She\r\nwas surprised by his next question.\r\n\r\n\'Ave! how has Mrs. Pugh behaved?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! the woman!  I have hardly thought of her!  She has been very\r\nactive about the petition, somebody said; but I don\'t believe Henry can\r\nbear to hear of her any more than I can.  What made you think of her?\'\r\n\r\n\'Because I wanted to know how it was with Henry, and I could not ask\r\nhim.  Poor fellow!  Well, Ave, you see he will depend on you entirely\r\nfor comfort, and you must promise me that shall be your great business\r\nand care.\'\r\n\r\n\'How you do think of Henry!\' she said, half jealously.\r\n\r\n\'Of course, Ave.  You and I have no past to grieve over together, but\r\npoor Henry will never feel free of having left me to my self-willed\r\nobstinacy, and let me go to that place.  Besides, the disgrace in the\r\nsight of the world touches him more, and you can tread that down more\r\neasily than he.\'  Then, in answer to a wondering look, \'Yes, you can,\r\nwhen you recollect that it is crime, not the appearance of it, that is\r\nshame.  I do not mean that I do not deserve all this--but--but--\' and\r\nhis eye glistened, \'Ave, dear, if I could only bring out the words to\r\ntell you how much peace and joy there is in knowing that--with that\r\nvast difference--it is like in some degree what was borne to save us, I\r\nreally don\'t think you could go on grieving over me any more; at least\r\nnot more than for the loss,\' he added, tenderly; \'and you\'ll not miss\r\nme so much in a new country, you know, with Henry and the children to\r\ntake care of.  Only promise me to be kind to Henry.\'\r\n\r\nAnd having drawn forth a faint promise, that he knew would have more\r\nforce by and by, Leonard went on, in his low quiet voice, into\r\nreminiscences that sounded like random, of the happy days of childhood\r\nand early youth, sometimes almost laughing over them, sometimes linking\r\nhis memory as it were to tune or flower, sport or study, but always for\r\njoy, and never for pain; and thus passed the time, with long intervals\r\nof silent thought and recollection on his part, and of a sort of dreamy\r\nstupor on his sister\'s, during which the strange peaceful hush seemed\r\nto have taken away her power of recalling the bitter complaints of\r\ncruel injustice, and the broken-hearted lamentations she had imagined\r\nherself pouring out in sympathy with her victim brother.  Instead of\r\nbeing wrung with anguish, her heart was lulled and quelled by wondering\r\nreverence; and she seemed to herself scarcely awake, and only dimly\r\nconscious of the pale-cheeked bright-eyed face upturned to her, so calm\r\nand undaunted, yet so full of awe and love, the low steady tender\r\nvoice, and the warm upholding arm.\r\n\r\nA great clock struck, and Leonard said, \'There! they were to come at\r\nfour, and then the chaplain is coming.  He is grown so very kind now!\r\nAve, if they would let you be with me at my last Communion!  Will you?\r\nCould you bear it?  I think then you would know all the peace of it!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, yes! make them let me come.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then it is not good-bye,\' he said, as he fetched her bonnet and cloak,\r\nand put them on with tender hands, as if she were a child, in readiness\r\nas steps approached, and her escort reappeared.\r\n\r\n\'Here she is, Henry,\' he said, with a smile.  \'She has been very good;\r\nshe may come again.\'  And then, holding her in his arms once more, he\r\nresigned her to Henry, saying, \'Not good-bye, Ave; we will keep my\r\nbirthday together.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                         The captives went\r\n  To their own places, to their separate glooms,\r\n  Uncheered by glance, or hand, or hope, to brood\r\n  On those impossible glories of the past,\r\n  When they might touch the grass, and see the sky,\r\n  And do the works of men.  But manly work\r\n  Is sometimes in a prison.--S. M. Queen Isabel\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Commutation of punishment, to penal servitude for life.\'\r\n\r\nSuch were the tidings that ran through Stoneborough on Sunday morning,\r\nmaking all feel as if a heavy oppression had been taken from the air.\r\nIn gratitude to the merciful authorities, and thankfulness for the\r\nexemption from death, the first impressions were that Justice was at\r\nlast speaking, that innocence could not suffer, and that right was\r\nreasserting itself.  Even when the more sober and sad remembered that\r\nleniency was not pardon, nor life liberty, they were hastily answered\r\nthat life was everything--life was hope, life was time, and time would\r\nshow truth.\r\n\r\nAveril\'s first tears dropped freely, as she laid her head on Mary\'s\r\nshoulder, and with her hand in Dr. May\'s, essayed to utter the words,\r\n\'It is your doing--you have twice saved him for me,\' and Minna stood\r\ncalmly glad, but without surprise.  \'I knew they could not hurt him;\r\nGod would not let them.\'\r\n\r\nThe joy and relief were so great as to absorb all thought or\r\nrealization of what this mercy was to the prisoner himself, until Dr.\r\nMay was able to pay him a visit on Monday afternoon.  It was at a\r\nmoment when the first effects of the tidings of life had subsided, and\r\nthere had been time to look forth on the future with a spirit more\r\nsteadfast than buoyant.  The strain of the previous weeks was reacting\r\non the bodily frame, and indisposition unhinged the spirits; so that,\r\nwhen Dr. May entered, beaming with congratulations, he was met with the\r\nsame patient glance of endurance, endeavouring at resignation, that he\r\nknew so well, but without the victorious peace that had of late gained\r\nthe ascendant expression.  There was instead an almost painful\r\nendeavour to manifest gratitude by cheerfulness, and the smile was far\r\nless natural than those of the last interview, as fervently returning\r\nthe pressure of the hand, he said, \'You were right, Dr. May, you have\r\nbrought me past the crisis.\'\r\n\r\n\'A sure sign of ultimate recovery, my boy.  Remember, dum spiro spero.\'\r\n\r\nLeonard attempted a responsive smile, but it was a hopeless business.\r\nFrom the moment when at the inquest he found himself entangled in the\r\nmeshes of circumstance, his mind had braced itself to endure rather\r\nthan hope, and his present depressed state, both mental and bodily,\r\nrendered even that endurance almost beyond his powers.  He could only\r\nsay, \'You have been very good to me.\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear fellow, you are sadly knocked down; I wish--\' and the Doctor\r\nlooked at him anxiously.\r\n\r\n\'I wish you had been here yesterday,\' said Leonard; \'then you would not\r\nhave found me so.  No, not thankless, indeed!\'\r\n\r\n\'No, indeed; but--yes, I see it was folly--nay, harshness, to expect\r\nyou to be glad of what lies before you, my poor boy.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am--am thankful,\' said Leonard, struggling to make the words truth.\r\n\'Wednesday is off my mind--yes, it is more than I deserve--I knew I was\r\nnot fit to die, and those at home are spared.  But I am as much cut off\r\nfrom them--perhaps more--than by death.  And it is the same disgrace to\r\nthem, the same exile.  I suppose Henry still goes--\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, he does.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah! then one thing, Dr. May--if you had a knife or scissors--I do not\r\nknow how soon they may cut my hair, and I want to secure a bit for poor\r\nAve.\'\r\n\r\nDr. May was too handless to have implements of the first order, but a\r\nknife he had, and was rather dismayed at Leonard\'s reckless hacking at\r\nhis bright shining wavy hair, pulling out more than he cut, with\r\nperfect indifference to the pain.  The Doctor stroked the chestnut head\r\nas tenderly as if it had been Gertrude\'s sunny curls, but Leonard\r\nstarted aside, and dashing away the tears that were overflowing his\r\neyes under the influence of the gentle action, asked vigorously, \'Have\r\nyou heard what they will do with me?\'\r\n\r\n\'I do not know thoroughly.  A year or six months maybe at one of the\r\ngreat model establishments, then probably you will be sent to some of\r\nthe public works,\' said the Doctor, sadly.  \'Yes, it is a small boon to\r\ngive you life, and take away all that makes life happy.\'\r\n\r\n\'If it were only transportation!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  In a new world you could live it down, and begin afresh.  And\r\neven here, Leonard, I look to finding you like Joseph in his prison.\'\r\n\r\n\'The iron entering into his soul!\' said Leonard, with a mournful smile.\r\n\r\n\'No; in the trustworthiness that made him honoured and blessed even\r\nthere.  Leonard, Leonard, conduct _will_ tell.  Even there, you can\r\nlive this down, and will!\'\r\n\r\n\'Eighteen to-morrow,\' replied the boy.  \'Fifty years of it, perhaps! I\r\nknow God can help me through with it, but it is a long time to be\r\npatient!\'\r\n\r\nBy way of answer, the Doctor launched into brilliant auguries of the\r\nimpression the prisoner\'s conduct would produce, uttering assurances,\r\nhighly extravagant in his Worship the Mayor, of the charms of the\r\nmodern system of prison discipline, but they fell flat; there could be\r\nno disguising that penal servitude for life was penal servitude for\r\nlife, and might well be bitterer than death itself.  Sympathy might\r\nindeed be balm to the captive, but the good Doctor pierced his own\r\nbreast to afford it, so that his heart sank even more than when he had\r\nleft the young man under sentence of death.  His least unavailing\r\nconsolations were his own promises of frequent visits, and Aubrey\'s of\r\ncorrespondence, but they produced more of dejected gratitude than of\r\nexhilaration.  Yet it was not in the way of murmur or repining, but\r\nrather of \'suffering and being strong,\' and only to this one friend was\r\nthe suffering permitted to be apparent.  To all the officials he was\r\nsimply submissive and gravely resolute; impassive if he encountered\r\nsharpness or sternness, but alert and grateful towards kindliness, of\r\nwhich he met more and more as the difference between dealing with him\r\nand the ordinary prisoners made itself felt.\r\n\r\nTo Dr. May alone was the depth of pain betrayed; but another comforter\r\nproved more efficient in cheering the prisoner, namely, Mr. Wilmot,\r\nwho, learning from the Doctor the depression of their young friend,\r\nhastened to endeavour at imparting a new spring of life on this\r\nmelancholy birthday.  Physically, the boy was better, and perhaps the\r\nnew day had worn off somewhat of the burthen of anticipation, for Mr.\r\nWilmot found him already less downcast, and open to consolation.  It\r\nmight be, too, that the sense that the present was to have been his\r\nlast day upon earth, had made him more conscious of the relief from the\r\nimmediate shadow of death, for he expressed his thankfulness far more\r\nfreely and without the effort of the previous day.\r\n\r\n\'And, depend on it,\' said Mr. Wilmot, \'you are spared because there is\r\nsomething for you to do.\'\r\n\r\n\'To bear,\' said Leonard.\r\n\r\n\'No, to do.  Perhaps not immediately; but try to look on whatever you\r\nhave to bear, not only as carrying the cross, as I think you already\r\nfeel it--\'\r\n\r\n\'Or there would be no standing it at all.\'\r\n\r\n\'True,\' said Mr. Wilmot; \'and your so feeling it convinces me the more\r\nthat whatever may follow is likewise to be looked upon as discipline to\r\ntrain you for something beyond.  Who knows what work may be in store,\r\nfor which this fiery trial may be meant to prepare you?\'\r\n\r\nThe head was raised, and the eyes brightened with something like hope\r\nin their fixed interrogative glance.\r\n\r\n\'Even as things are now, who knows what good may be done by the\r\npresence of a man educated, religious, unstained by crime, yet in the\r\nsame case as those around him?  I do not mean by quitting your natural\r\nplace, but by merely living as you must live.  You were willing to have\r\nfollowed your Master in His death.  You now have to follow Him by\r\nliving as one under punishment; and be sure it is for some purpose for\r\nothers as well as yourself.\'\r\n\r\n\'If there is any work to be done for Him, it is all right,\' said\r\nLeonard, cheerily; and as Mr. Wilmot paused, he added, \'It would be\r\nlike working for a friend--if I may dare say so--after the hours when\r\nthis place has been made happy to me.  I should not mind anything if I\r\nmight only feel it working for Him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Feel it.  Be certain of it.  As you have realized the support of that\r\nFriend in a way that is hardly granted, save in great troubles, so now\r\nrealize that every task is for Him.  Do not look on the labour as\r\nhardship inflicted by mistaken authority--\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I only want to get to that!  I have been so long with nothing to\r\ndo!\'\r\n\r\n\'And your hearty doing of it, be it what it may, as unto the Lord, can\r\nbe as acceptable as Dr. May\'s labours of love among the poor--as\r\nentirely a note in the great concord in Heaven and earth as the work of\r\nthe ministry itself--as completely in unison.  Nay, further, such\r\nobedient and hearty work will form you for whatever may yet be awaiting\r\nyou, and what that may be will show itself in good time, when you are\r\nready for it.\r\n\r\n\'The right chord was touched, the spirit of energy was roused, and\r\nLeonard was content to be a prisoner of hope, not the restless hope of\r\nliberation, but the restful hope that he might yet render faithful\r\nservice even in his present circumstances.\r\n\r\nNot much passed his lips in this interview, but its effect was apparent\r\nwhen Dr. May again saw him, and this time in company with Aubrey.  Most\r\nurgent had been the boy\'s entreaties to be taken to see his friend, and\r\nDr. May had only hesitated because Leonard\'s depression had made\r\nhimself so unhappy that he feared its effect on his susceptible son;\r\nwhose health had already suffered from the long course of grief and\r\nsuspense.  But it was plain that if Aubrey were to go at all, it must\r\nbe at once, since the day was fixed for the prisoner\'s removal, and the\r\nstill nearer and dearer claims must not clash with those of the friend.\r\nFlora shook her head, and reminded her father that Leonard would not be\r\nout of reach in future, and that the meeting now might seriously damage\r\nAubrey\'s already uncertain health.\r\n\r\n\'I cannot help it, Flora,\' said the Doctor; \'it may do him some\r\ntemporary harm, but I had rather see him knocked down for a day or two,\r\nthan breed him up to be such a poor creature as to sacrifice his\r\nfriendship to his health.\'\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. Rivers, who knew what the neighbourhood thought of the good\r\nDoctor\'s infatuation, felt that there was not much use in suggesting\r\nhow shocked the world would be at his encouragement of the intimacy\r\nbetween the convict and his young son.\r\n\r\nPeople did look surprised when the Doctor asked admission to the cell\r\nfor his son as well as himself; and truly Aubrey, who in silence had\r\nworked himself into an agony of nervous agitation, looked far from fit\r\nfor anything trying.  Dr. May saw that he must not ask to leave the\r\nyoung friends alone together, but in his reverence for the rights of\r\ntheir friendship, he withdrew himself as far as the limits of the cell\r\nwould allow, turned his back, and endeavoured to read the Thirty-nine\r\nArticles in Leonard\'s Prayer-Book; but in spite of all his abstraction,\r\nhe could not avoid a complete consciousness that the two lads sat on\r\nthe bed, clinging with arms round one another like young children, and\r\nthat it was Leonard\'s that was the upright sustaining figure, his own\r\nAubrey\'s the prone and leaning one.  And of the low whispering murmurs\r\nthat reached his would-be deafened ear, the gasping almost sobbing\r\ntones were Aubrey\'s.  The first distinct words that he could not help\r\nhearing were, \'No such thing!  There can\'t be slavery where one works\r\nwith a will!\' and again, in reply to something unheard, \'Yes, one can!\r\nWhy, how did one do one\'s Greek?\'--\'Very\r\ndifferent!\'--\'How?\'--\'Oh!\'--\'Yes; but you are a clever chap, and had\r\nher to teach you, but I only liked it because I\'d got it to do.  Just\r\nthe same with the desk-work down at the mill; so it may be the same\r\nnow.\'\r\n\r\nThen came fragments of what poor Aubrey had expressed more than once at\r\nhome--that his interest in life, in study, in sport, was all gone with\r\nhis friend.\r\n\r\n\'Come, Aubrey, that\'s stuff.  You\'d have had to go to Cambridge, you\r\nknow, without me, after I doggedly put myself at that place.  There\'s\r\njust as much for you to do as ever there was.\'\r\n\r\n\'How you keep on with your _do_!\' cried Ethel\'s spoilt child, with a\r\ntouch of petulance.\r\n\r\n\'Why, what are we come here for--into this world, I mean--but to _do_!\'\r\nreturned Leonard; \'and I take it, if we do it right, it does not much\r\nmatter what or where it is.\'\r\n\r\n\'I shan\'t have any heart for it!\' sighed Aubrey.\r\n\r\n\'Nonsense!  Not with all your people at home? and though the voice fell\r\nagain, the Doctor\'s ears distinguished the murmur, \'Why, just the\r\nlittle things she let drop are the greatest help to me here, and you\r\nalways have her--\'\r\n\r\nThen ensued much that was quite inaudible, and at last Leonard said,\r\n\'No, old fellow; as long as you don\'t get ashamed of me, thinking about\r\nyou, and knowing what you are about, will be one of the best pleasures\r\nI shall have.  And look here, Aubrey, if we only consider it right, you\r\nand I will be just as really working together, when you are at your\r\nbooks, and I am making mats, as if we were both at Cambridge side by\r\nside!  It is quite true, is it not, Dr. May?\' he added, since the\r\nDoctor, finding it time to depart, had turned round to close the\r\ninterview.\r\n\r\n\'Quite true, my boy,\' said the Doctor; \'and I hope Aubrey will try to\r\ntake comfort and spirit from it.\'\r\n\r\n\'As if I could!\' said Aubrey, impatiently, \'when it only makes me more\r\nmad to see what a fellow they have shut up in here!\'\r\n\r\n\'Not mad, I hope,\' said Dr. May; \'but I\'ll tell you what it should do\r\nfor both of us, Aubrey.  It should make us very careful to be worthy to\r\nremain his friends.\'\r\n\r\n\'O, Dr. May!\' broke in Leonard, distressed.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' returned Dr. May, \'I mean what I say, however you break in,\r\nMaster Leonard.  As long as this boy of mine is doing his best for the\r\nright motives, he will care for you as he does now--not quite in the\r\nsame despairing way, of course, for holes in one\'s daily life do close\r\nthemselves up with time--but if he slacks off in his respect or\r\naffection for you, then I shall begin to have fears of him.  Now come\r\naway, Aubrey, and remember for your comfort it is not the good-bye it\r\nmight have been,\' he added, as he watched the mute intensity of the\r\nboys\' farewell clasp of the hands; but even then had some difficulty in\r\ngetting Aubrey away from the friend so much stronger as the consoler\r\nthan as the consoled, and unconsciously showing how in the last\r\ntwenty-four hours his mind had acted on the topics presented to him by\r\nMr. Wilmot.\r\n\r\nChanged as he was from the impetuous boyish lad of a few weeks since, a\r\nchange even more noticeable when with his contemporary than in\r\nintercourse with elder men, yet the nature was the same.  Obstinacy had\r\nsoftened into constancy, pride into resolution, generosity made pardon\r\nless difficult, and elevation of temper bore him through many a\r\nhumiliation that, through him, bitterly galled his brother.\r\n\r\nWhatever he might feel, prison regulations were accepted by him as\r\nmatters of course, not worth being treated as separate grievances. He\r\nnever showed any shrinking from the assumption of the convict dress,\r\nwhilst Henry was fretting and wincing over the very notion of his\r\nwearing it, and trying to arrange that the farewell interview should\r\nprecede its adoption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n  Scorn of me recoils on you.\r\n                 E. B. BROWNING\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the first relief, the relaxation of his brother\'s sentence had by\r\nno means mitigated Henry Ward\'s sense of disgrace, but had rather\r\ndeepened it by keeping poor Leonard a living, not a dead, sorrow.\r\n\r\nHe was determined to leave England as soon as possible, that his\r\nsisters might never feel that they were the relative of a convict; and\r\nbringing Ella home, he promulgated a decree that Leonard was never to\r\nbe mentioned; hoping that his existence might be forgotten by the\r\nlittle ones.\r\n\r\nTo hurry from old scenes, and sever former connections, was his sole\r\nthought, as if he could thus break the tie of brotherhood.  There was a\r\nhalf-formed link that had more easily snapped.  His courtship had been\r\none of prudence and convenience, and in the overwhelming period of\r\nhorror and suspense had been almost forgotten.  The lady\'s attempts at\r\nsympathy had been rejected by Averil without obstruction from him, for\r\nhe had no such love as could have prevented her good offices from\r\nbecoming oppressive to his wounded spirit, and he had not sufficient\r\nenergy or inclination to rouse himself to a response.\r\n\r\nAnd when the grant of life enabled him to raise his head and look\r\naround him, he felt the failure of his plans an aggravation of his\r\ncalamity, though he did not perceive that his impatience to rid himself\r\nof an encumbrance, and clear the way for his marriage, had been the\r\nreal origin of the misfortune.  Still he was glad that matters had gone\r\nno further, and that there was no involvement beyond what could be\r\nhandsomely disposed of by a letter, resigning his pretensions, and\r\nrejoicing that innate delicacy and prudence had prevented what might\r\nhave involved the lady\'s feelings more deeply in the misfortune of his\r\nfamily: representing himself in all good faith as having retreated from\r\nher proffered sympathy out of devoted consideration for her, and\r\nclosing with elaborate thanks for her exertions on behalf of \'his\r\nunhappy brother.\'\r\n\r\nThe letter had the honour of being infinitely lauded by Mrs. Ledwich,\r\nwho dwelt on its nobleness and tenderness in many a tete-a-tete, and\r\ndeclared her surprise and thankfulness at the immunity of her dear\r\nMatilda\'s heart.  In strict confidence, too, Dr. Spencer (among others)\r\nlearnt that--though it was not to be breathed till the year was out,\r\nabove all till the poor Wards were gone--the dear romantic girl had\r\nmade her hand the guerdon for obtaining Leonard\'s life.\r\n\r\n\'So there\'s your fate, Dick,\' concluded his friend.\r\n\r\n\'You forget the influence of the press,\' returned Dr. May.  \'People\r\ndon\'t propose such guerdons without knowing who is to earn them.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, she has long believed in King John,\' said Ethel.\r\n\r\nMeantime Averil Ward was acquiescing in all Henry\'s projects with calm\r\ndesperate passiveness.  She told Mary that she had resolved that she\r\nwould never again contend with Henry, but would let him do what he\r\nwould with herself and her sisters.  Nor had his tenderness during her\r\nillness been in vain; it had inspired reliance and affection, such as\r\nto give her the instinct of adherence to him as the one stay left to\r\nher.  With Leonard shut up, all places were the same to her, except\r\nthat she was in haste to escape from the scenes connected with her lost\r\nbrother; and she looked forward with dull despairing acquiescence to\r\nthe new life with which Henry hoped to shake off the past.\r\n\r\nA colony was not change enough for Henry\'s wishes; even there he made\r\nsure of being recognized as the convict\'s brother, and was resolved to\r\nseek his new home in the wide field of America, disguising his very\r\nname, as Warden, and keeping up no communication with the prisoner\r\nexcept under cover to Dr. May.\r\n\r\nTo this unfailing friend was committed the charge of the brother.  He\r\nundertook to watch over the boy, visit him from time to time, take care\r\nof his health, and obtain for him any alleviations permitted by the\r\nprison rules; and as Henry reiterated to Averil, it was absolutely\r\ncertain that everything possible from external kindness was thus\r\nsecured.  What more could they themselves have done, but show him their\r\nfaces at the permitted intervals? which would be mere wear and tear of\r\nfeeling, very bad for both parties.\r\n\r\nAveril drooped, and disputed not--guessing, though not yet\r\nunderstanding, the heart hunger she should feel even for such a dreary\r\nglimpse.\r\n\r\nEvery hour seemed to be another turn of the wheel that hurried on the\r\ndeparture.  The successor wished to take house and furniture as they\r\nstood, and to enter into possession as soon as possible, as he already\r\nhad taken the practice.  This coincided with Henry\'s burning impatience\r\nto be quit of everything, and to try to drown the sense of his own\r\nidentity in the crowds of London.  He was his sisters\' only guardian,\r\ntheir property was entirely in his hands, and no one had the power of\r\noffering any obstacle, so that no delay could be interposed; and the\r\nvague design passed with startling suddenness to a fixed decision, to\r\nbe carried into execution immediately.  It came in one burst upon the\r\nMay household that Averil and her sisters were coming to spend a last\r\nevening before their absolute packing to go on the Saturday to London,\r\nwhere they would provide their outfit, and start in a month for America.\r\n\r\nThe tidings were brought by Mary, who had, as usual, been spending part\r\nof the morning with Averil.  No one seemed to be so much taken by\r\nsurprise as Tom, whose first movement was to fall on his sisters for\r\nnot having made him aware of such a preposterous scheme.  They thought\r\nhe knew.  He knew that all the five quarters of the world had been\r\ntalked of in a wild sort of a way; but how could he suppose that any\r\nman could be crazed enough to prefer to be an American citizen, when he\r\nmight remain a British subject?\r\n\r\nRepugnance to America was naturally strong in Tom, and had of late been\r\nenhanced by conversations with an Eton friend, who, while quartered in\r\nCanada, had made excursions into the States, and acquired such\r\nimpressions as high-bred young officers were apt to bring home from a\r\nsuperficial view of them.  Thus fortified, he demanded whether any\r\nreasonable person had tried to bring Henry Ward to his senses.\r\n\r\nEthel believed that papa had advised otherwise.\r\n\r\n\'Advised!  It should have been enforced!  If he is fool enough to alter\r\nhis name, and throw up all his certificates what is to become of him?\r\nHe will get no practice in any civilized place, and will have to betake\r\nhimself to some pestilential swamp, will slave his sisters to death,\r\nspend their money, and destroy them with ague.  How can you sit still\r\nand look on, Ethel?\'\r\n\r\n\'But what could I do?\'\r\n\r\n\'Stir up my father to interfere.\'\r\n\r\n\'I thought you always warned us against interfering with Henry Ward.\'\r\n\r\nHe treated this speech as maliciously designed to enrage him. \'Ethel!\'\r\nhe stammered, \'in a case like this--where the welfare--the very\r\nlife--of one--of your dearest friend--of Mary\'s, I mean--I did think\r\nyou would have been above--\'\r\n\r\n\'But, Tom, I would do my utmost, and so would papa, if it were possible\r\nto do anything; but it is quite in vain.  Henry is resolved against\r\nremaining under British rule, and America seems to be the only field\r\nfor him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Much you know or care!\' cried Tom.  \'Well, if no one else will, I\r\nmust!\'\r\n\r\nWith which words he departed, leaving his sister surprised at his\r\nsolicitude, and dubious of the efficacy of his remonstrance, though she\r\nknew by experience that Tom was very different in a great matter from\r\nwhat he was in a small one.\r\n\r\nTom betook himself to Bankside, and the first person he encountered\r\nthere was his little friend Ella, who ran up to him at once.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Mr. Tom, we are going to America!  Shall you be sorry?\'\r\n\r\n\'Very sorry,\' said Tom, as the little hand was confidingly thrust into\r\nhis.\r\n\r\n\'I should not mind it, if you were coming too, Mr. Tom!\'\r\n\r\n\'What, to play at French billiards?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, indeed!  To find objects for the microscope.  I shall save all the\r\nobjects I meet, and send them home in a letter.\'\r\n\r\n\'An alligator or two, or a branch of the Mississippi,\' said Tom, in a\r\nyoung man\'s absent way of half-answering a pet child; but the reply so\r\nstruck Ella\'s fancy, that, springing through the open French window,\r\nshe cried,  \'Oh, Ave, Ave, here is Mr. Tom saying I am to send him a\r\nbranch of the Mississippi in a letter, as an object for his microscope!\'\r\n\r\n\'I beg your pardon,\' said Tom, shocked at Averil\'s nervous start, and\r\nstill more shocked at her appearance.  She looked like one shattered by\r\nlong and severe illness; her eyes were restless and distressed, her\r\nhair thrust back as if it oppressed her temples, her manner startled\r\nand over-wrought, her hand hot and unsteady--her whole air that of one\r\ntotally unequal to the task before her.  He apologized for having taken\r\nher by surprise, and asked for her brother.  She answered, that he was\r\nbusy at Mr. Bramshaw\'s, and she did not know when he would come in.\r\nBut still Tom lingered; he could not bear to leave her to exertions\r\nbeyond her strength.  \'You are tiring yourself,\' he said; \'can I do\r\nnothing to help you?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no, thank you; I am only looking over things.  Minna is helping\r\nme, and I am making an inventory.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then you must let me be of use to you.  You must be as quiet as\r\npossible.  You need rest.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t rest; I\'m better busy!\' she said hastily, with quick, aimless,\r\nbustling movements.\r\n\r\nBut Tom had his father\'s tone, as he gently arrested the trembling hand\r\nthat was pulling open a drawer, and with his father\'s sweet, convincing\r\nsmile, said, \'What\'s that for?\' then drew up a large arm-chair, placed\r\nher in it, and, taking pen and list, began to write--sometimes at her\r\nsuggestion, sometimes at his own--giving business-like and efficient\r\naid.\r\n\r\nThe work was so grave and regular, that Ella soon found the room\r\ntedious, and crept out, calling Minna to aid in some of their own\r\npersonal matters.\r\n\r\nSlowly enumerating the articles they came to the piano.  Averil went up\r\nto it, leant fondly against it, and softly touched the keys.  \'My own,\'\r\nshe said, \'bought for a surprise to me when I came home from school!\r\nAnd oh, how he loved it!\'\r\n\r\n\'Every one had reason to love it,\' said Tom, in a low voice; but she\r\ndid not heed or hear.\r\n\r\n\'I cannot--cannot part with it!  When I sit here, I can almost feel him\r\nleaning over me!  You must go--I will pay your expenses myself! I\r\nwonder if we should have such rough roads as would hurt you,\' she\r\nadded, caressingly toying with the notes, and bringing soft replies\r\nfrom them, as if she were conversing with a living thing.\r\n\r\n\'Ah!\' said Tom, coming nearer, \'you will, I hope, take care to what\r\nyour brother\'s impetuosity might expose either this, or yourself.\'\r\n\r\n\'We shall all fare alike,\' she said, carelessly.\r\n\r\n\'But how?\' said Tom.\r\n\r\n\'Henry will take care of that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you know, Miss Ward, I came down here with the purpose of setting\r\nsome matters before your brother that might dissuade him from making\r\nthe United States his home.  You have justly more influence than I.\r\nWill you object to hear them from me?\'\r\n\r\nAve could not imagine why Tom May, of all people in the world, should\r\nthrust himself into the discussion of her plans; but she could only\r\nsubmit to listen, or more truly to lean back with wandering thoughts\r\nand mechanical signs of assent, as he urged his numerous objections.\r\nFinally, she uttered a meek \'Thank you,\' in the trust that it was over.\r\n\r\n\'And will you try to make your brother consider these things?\'\r\n\r\nPoor Ave could not have stood an examination on \'these things,\' and\r\nfeeling inadequate to undertake the subject, merely said something of\r\n\'very kind, but she feared it would be of no use.\'\r\n\r\n\'I assure you, if you would persuade him to talk it over with me, that\r\nI could show him that he would involve you all in what would be most\r\ndistasteful.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, but his mind is made up.  No other course is open.\'\r\n\r\n\'Could he not, at least, go and see what he thinks of it, before taking\r\nyou and your sisters?\'\r\n\r\n\'Impossible!\' said Averil.  \'We must all keep together; we have no one\r\nelse.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, indeed, you must not say that,\' cried Tom, with a fire that\r\nstartled Averil in the midst of her languid, dreary indifference.\r\n\r\n\'I did not mean,\' she said, \'to be ungrateful for the kindness of your\r\nfamily--the Doctor and dear Mary, above all; but you must know-\'\r\n\r\n\'I know,\' he interrupted, \'that I cannot see you exiling yourself with\r\nyour brother, because you think you have no one else to turn to--you,\r\nwho are so infinitely dear--\'\r\n\r\n\'This is no time for satire,\' she said, drawing aside with offence, but\r\nstill wearily, and as if she had not given attention enough to\r\nunderstand him.\r\n\r\n\'You mistake me,\' he exclaimed; \'I mean that no words can tell how\r\nstrong the feeling is that--that--No, I never knew its force till now;\r\nbut, Averil, I cannot part with you--you who are all the world to me.\'\r\n\r\nLifting her heavy eyelids for a moment, she looked bewildered, and\r\nthen, moving towards the door, said, \'I don\'t know whether this is jest\r\nor earnest--any way, it is equally unsuitable.\'\r\n\r\n\'What do you see in me,\' cried Tom, throwing himself before her, \'that\r\nyou should suppose me capable of jesting on such a subject, at such a\r\nmoment?\'\r\n\r\n\'I never saw anything but supercilious irony,\' she answered, in the\r\nsame dreamy, indifferent way, as if hardly aware what she was saying,\r\nand still moving on.\r\n\r\n\'I cannot let you go thus.  You must hear me,\' he cried, and he wheeled\r\nround an easy-chair, with a gesture of entreaty; which she obeyed,\r\npartly because she was hardly alive to understand his drift, partly\r\nbecause she could scarcely stand; and there she sat, in the same drowsy\r\nresignation with which she had listened to his former expostulation.\r\n\r\nCalm collected Tom was almost beside himself.  \'Averil!  Averil!\' he\r\ncried, as he sat down opposite and bent as close to her as possible,\r\n\'if I could only make you listen or believe me!  What shall I say? It\r\nis only the honest truth that you are the dearest thing in the whole\r\nworld to me!  The very things that have given you most offence arose\r\nfrom my struggles with my own feelings.  I tried to crush what would\r\nhave its way in spite of me, and now you see its force.\'  He saw\r\ngreater life and comprehension in her eye as he spoke, but the look was\r\nnot encouraging; and he continued: \'How can I make you understand!  Oh!\r\nif I had but more time!--but--but it was only the misery of those\r\nmoments that showed me why it was that I was always irresistibly drawn\r\nto you, and yet made instinctive efforts to break the spell; and now\r\nyou will not understand.\'\r\n\r\n\'I do understand,\' said Averil, at length entirely roused, but chiefly\r\nby resentment.  \'I understand how much a country surgeon\'s daughter is\r\nbeneath an M. D.\'s attention, and how needful it was to preserve the\r\ndistance by marks of contempt.  As a convict\'s sister, the distance is\r\nso much widened, that it is well for both that we shall never meet\r\nagain.\'\r\n\r\nTherewith she had risen, and moved to the door.  \'Nay, nay,\' he cried;\r\n\'it is for that very reason that all my past absurdity is trampled on!\r\nI should glory in a connection with such as Leonard! Yes, Averil,\' as\r\nhe fancied he saw her touched, \'you have never known me yet; but trust\r\nyourself and him to me, and you will give him a true brother, proud of\r\nhis nobleness.  You shall see him constantly--you shall keep your\r\nsisters with you.  Only put yourself in my hands, and you shall know\r\nwhat devotion is.\'\r\n\r\nHe would have said more, but Averil recalled herself, and said: \'This\r\nis mere folly; you would be very sorry, were I to take you at your\r\nword.  It would be unworthy in me towards your father, towards Henry,\r\ntowards you, for me to listen to you, even if I liked you, and that you\r\nhave taken good care to prevent me from doing.\'  And she opened the\r\ndoor, and made her way into the hall.\r\n\r\n\'But, Averil!--Miss Ward!\' he continued, pursuing her, \'if, as I swear\r\nI will, I track out the real offender, bring him to justice, proclaim\r\nLeonard\'s innocence?  Then--\'\r\n\r\nShe was half-way up the stairs.  He had no alternative but to take his\r\nhat and stride off in a tumult of dismay, first of all at the\r\nrejection, and next at his own betrayal of himself.  Had he guessed\r\nwhat it would come to, would he ever have trusted himself in that\r\ndrawing-room?  This was the meaning of it all, was it?  He, the\r\nsensible man of the family, not only to be such an egregious ass, but\r\nto have made such a fool of himself!  For he was as furious at having\r\ncommitted himself to himself, as he was at his avowal to Averil--he,\r\nwho had always been certain of loving so wisely and so well, choosing\r\nan example of the true feminine balance of excellence, well born, but\r\nnot too grand for the May pretensions; soundly religious, but not\r\nphilanthropically pious; of good sense and ability enough for his\r\ncomfort, but not of overgrown genius for his discomfort; of good looks\r\nenough for satisfaction, but not for dangerous admiration; of useful,\r\nbut not overwhelming wealth; of creditable and not troublesome\r\nkindred--that he should find himself plunged headlong into love by\r\nthose brown eyes and straight features, by the musical genius, talents\r\nanything but domestic, ill-regulated enthusiasm, nay, dislike to\r\nhimself, in the very girl whose station and family he contemned at the\r\nbest, and at the very time when her brother was a convict, and her\r\nsisters dependent!  Was he crazed?  Was he transformed?  What frenzy\r\nhad come over him to endear her the more for being the reverse of his\r\nideal?  And, through all, his very heart was bursting at the thought of\r\nthe wounds he had given her in his struggles against the net of\r\nfascination.  He had never imagined the extent of the provocation he\r\ngave; and in truth, his habitual manner was such, that it was hard to\r\ndistinguish between irony and genuine interest.  And now it was too\r\nlate!  What should he be henceforth to her?  What would Stoneborough\r\nand his future be to him?  He would, he believed, have taught himself\r\nto acquiesce, had he seen any chance of happiness before her; but the\r\npicture he drew of her prospects justified his misery, at being only\r\nable to goad her on, instead of drawing her back.  He was absolutely\r\namazed at himself.  He had spoken only the literal truth, when he said\r\nthat he had been unconscious of the true nature of the feelings that\r\nalways drew him towards her, though only to assert his independence,\r\nand make experiments by teasing in his ironically courteous way.  Not\r\nuntil the desolate indifference of her tone had incited him to show her\r\nthat Henry was not all that remained to her, had he arrived at the\r\nperception that, in the late weeks of anxiety, she had grown into his\r\nheart, and that it was of no use to argue the point with himself, or\r\nthink what he would do, the fact was accomplished--his first love was a\r\ndirect contradiction to his fixed opinions, he had offended her\r\nirrevocably and made a fool of himself, and she was going away to\r\ndreariness!\r\n\r\nAt first he had rushed off into the melancholy meadows, among the\r\nsodden hay-cocks still standing among the green growth of grass; but a\r\nshower, increasing the damp forlornness of the ungenial day, made him\r\nturn homewards.  When, late in the afternoon, Ethel came into the\r\nschoolroom for some Cocksmoor stores, she found him leaning over his\r\nbooks on the table.  This was his usual place for study; and she did\r\nnot at once perceive that the attitude was only assumed on her\r\nentrance, so kneeling in front of her cupboard, she asked, \'What\r\nsuccess?\'\r\n\r\n\'I have not seen him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! I thought I saw you going--\'\r\n\r\n\'Never mind!  I mean,\' he added with some confusion, \'I wish for a\r\nlittle peace.  I have a horrid headache.\'\r\n\r\n\'You!\' exclaimed Ethel; and turning round, she saw him leaning back in\r\nhis chair, a defenceless animal without his spectacles, his eyes small\r\nand purpled ringed, his hair tossed about, his spruceness gone. \'I am\r\nsure you are not well,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'Quite well.  Nonsense, I only want quiet.\'\r\n\r\n\'Let me give you some of Aubrey\'s camphor liniment.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you,\' submitting to a burning application to his brow; but as\r\nshe lingered in anxiety, \'I really want nothing but quiet.\'\r\n\r\nHow like Norman he looks! thought Ethel, as she cast her last glance\r\nand departed.  Can he be going to be ill?  If he would only tell when\r\nanything is the matter!  I know papa says that some of us feel with our\r\nbodies, and some with our minds; but then I never knew Tom much\r\naffected any way, and what is all this to him?  And a sigh betrayed the\r\nsuppressed heartache that underlaid all her sensations.  I am afraid it\r\nmust be illness; but any way, he will neither tell nor bear to have it\r\nnoticed, so I can only watch.\r\n\r\nEnter the two little Wards, with a message that Ave was sorry, but that\r\nshe was too much tired to come that evening; and when Mary regretted\r\nnot having been able to come and help her, Ella answered that \'Mr. Tom\r\nhad come and helped her for a long time.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Minna; \'but I think he must have done it all wrong, for, do\r\nyou know, I found the list he had made torn up into little bits.\r\n\r\nEthel almost visibly started, almost audibly exclaimed.  At tea-time\r\nTom appeared, his trimness restored, but not his usual colouring; and\r\nElla hailed him with reproaches for having gone away without telling\r\nher.  The soft attention of which the child had a monopoly did not\r\nfail, though he bent down, trying to keep her to himself, and prevent\r\ntheir colloquy from attracting notice; but they were so close behind\r\nEthel\'s chair, that she could not help hearing: \'We were only gone to\r\ndig up the violets that you are to have, and if you had only stayed you\r\nwould have seen Henry, for he came in by the little gate, and when I\r\nwent to tell you, you were gone.\'\r\n\r\nEthel wondered whether the blushes she felt burning all over her face\r\nand neck would be remarked by those before her, or would reveal to Tom,\r\nbehind her, that the child was giving her the key to his mystery.\r\nMarvelling at the exemplary gentleness and patience of his replies to\r\nhis little coquettish tormentor, she next set herself to relieve him by\r\na summons to Ella to tea and cherries.  Fortunately the fruit suggested\r\nDr. May\'s reminiscences of old raids on cherry orchards now a mere\r\nname, and he thus engrossed all the younger audience not entirely\r\npreoccupied.  He set himself to make the little guests forget all their\r\nsorrows, as if he could not help warming them for the last time in the\r\nmagic of his own sunshine; but Ethel heard and saw little but one\r\nfigure in the quietest corner of the room, a figure at which she\r\nscarcely dared to look.\r\n\r\n\'And there you are!\' so went her thoughts.  \'It is true then!  Fairly\r\ncaught!  Your lofty crest vailed at last--and at such a time!  O, Tom,\r\ngenerous and true-hearted, in spite of all your nonsense!  How could\r\nshe help being touched?  In the net and against his will!  Oh, triumph\r\nof womanhood!  I am so glad!  No, I\'m not, it is best this way, for\r\nwhat an awkward mess it would have been!  She is dear Leonard\'s sister,\r\nto be sure, and there is stuff in her, but papa does not take to her,\r\nand I don\'t know whether she would fit in with Tom himself!  But oh!\r\nthe fun it would have been to see Flora\'s horror at finding her one\r\nprudent brother no better than the rest of us!  Dear old Tom!  The May\r\nheart has been too strong for the old Professor nature!  What a\r\nretribution for his high mightiness!  Harry and Richard to be guarded\r\nfrom making fools of themselves!  What a nice cloak for jealousy!  But\r\nit is no laughing matter!  How miserable, how thoroughly upset, he is!\r\nPoor dear Tom!  If I could only go and kiss you, and tell you that I\r\nnever loved you half so well; but you would rather die than let out one\r\nword, I know!  Why, any one of the others would have had it all out\r\nlong ago!  And I don\'t know whether it is quite safe to screen the lamp\r\nfrom those aching eyes that are bearing it like a martyr!  There!\r\nWell, maybe he will just stand the knowing that I know, provided I\r\ndon\'t say a word; but I wish people would not be so "self-contained!"\'\r\n\r\nSelf-contained Tom still continued in the morning, though looking\r\nsallow and wan; but, in a political argument with his father, he was\r\nsnappish and overbearing, and in the course of the day gave another\r\nindication of being thrown off his balance, which was even harder for\r\nEthel to endure.\r\n\r\nThroughout the suspense on Leonard\'s account, Aubrey had been a source\r\nof anxiety to all, especially to Tom.  The boy\'s sensitive frame had\r\nbeen so much affected, that tender dealings with him were needful, and\r\nall compulsion had been avoided. His father had caused him to be put on\r\nthe sick-list of the volunteers; and as for his studies, though the\r\nbooks were daily brought out, it was only to prevent the vacuum of\r\nidleness; and Tom had made it his business to nurse his brother\'s\r\npowers, avoid all strain on the attention, and occupy without exciting,\r\nbearing with his fitful moods of despondence or of hope, whether they\r\ntook the form of talking or of dreaming.\r\n\r\nBut now that all was over, every one knew that it was time to turn over\r\na new leaf; and Tom, with his sore heart, did it with a vengeance, and\r\non the first instance of carelessness, fell on the poor family pet, as\r\na younger brother and legitimate souffre douleur, with vehemence\r\nproportioned to his own annoyance.  It was a fierce lecture upon\r\ngeneral listlessness, want of manliness, spirit, and perseverance,\r\nindifference to duties he had assumed.  Nonsense about feelings--a\r\nfellow was not worth the snap of a finger who could not subdue his\r\nfeelings--trash.\r\n\r\nThe sisters heard the storm from the drawing-room, and Gertrude grew\r\nhotly indignant, and wanted Ethel to rush in to the rescue; but Ethel,\r\nthough greatly moved, knew that female interposition only aggravated\r\nsuch matters, and restrained herself and her sister till she heard Tom\r\nstride off.  Then creeping in on tiptoe, she found the boy sitting\r\nstunned and confounded by the novelty of the thing.\r\n\r\n\'What can it be all about, Ethel?  I never had such a slanging in my\r\nlife?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think Tom is quite well.  He had a bad headache last night.\'\r\n\r\nThen I hope--I mean, I think--he must have made it worse!  I know mine\r\naches, as if I had been next door to the great bell;\' and he leant\r\nagainst his sister.\r\n\r\n\'I am afraid you really were inattentive.\'\r\n\r\n\'No worse than since the heart has gone out of everything.  But that\r\nwas not all!  Ethel, can it really be a disgrace, and desertion, and\r\nall that, if I don\'t go on with those volunteers, when it makes me sick\r\nto think of touching my rifle?\' and his eyes filled with tears.\r\n\r\n\'It would be a great effort, I know,\' said Ethel, smoothing his hair;\r\n\'but after all, you volunteered not for pleasure, but because your\r\ncountry wanted defence.\'\r\n\r\n\'The country?  I don\'t care for it, since it condemned him, when he was\r\nserving it.\'\r\n\r\n\'He would not say that, Aubrey!  He would only be vexed to hear that\r\nyou gave in, and were fickle to your undertaking.  Indeed, if I were\r\nthe volunteer, I should think it due to him, not to shrink as if I were\r\nashamed of what he was connected with.\'\r\n\r\nAubrey tried to answer her sweet high-spirited smile, but he had been\r\ngreatly hurt and distressed, and the late reproach to his manhood\r\nembittered his tears without making it easier to repress them; and\r\npushing away his chair, he darted up-stairs.\r\n\r\n\'Poor dear fellow!  I\'ve been very hard on him, and only blamed instead\r\nof comforting,\' thought Ethel sadly, as she slowly entered the passage,\r\n\'what shall I think of, to make a break for both of those two?\'\r\n\r\n\'So you have been cockering your infant,\' said Tom, meeting her. \'You\r\nmean to keep him a baby all his life.\'\r\n\r\n\'Tom, I want to talk to you,\' said she.\r\n\r\nIn expectation of her displeasure, he met it half way, setting his back\r\nagainst the passage wall, and dogmatically declaring, \'You\'ll be the\r\nruin of him if you go on in this way!  How is he ever to go through the\r\nworld if you are to be always wiping his tears with an embroidered\r\npocket-handkerchief, and cossetting him up like a blessed little\r\nsucking lamb?\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course he must rough it,\' said Ethel, setting her back against the\r\nopposite wall; \'I only want him to be hardened; but after a shock like\r\nthis, one cannot go on as if one was a stock or stake.  Even a machine\r\nwould have its wheels out of order--\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, well, but it is time that should be over.\'\r\n\r\n\'So it is;\' and as the sudden thought flashed on her, \'Tom, I want you\r\nto reconsider your journey, that you gave up in the spring, and take\r\nhim--\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t want to go anywhere,\' he wearily said.\r\n\r\n\'Only it would be so good for him,\' said Ethel earnestly; \'he really\r\nought to see something taller than the Minster tower, and you are the\r\nonly right person to take him, you are so kind to him.\'\r\n\r\n\'For instance?\' he said, smiling.\r\n\r\n\'Accidents will happen in the best regulated families; besides, he did\r\nwant shaking up.  I dare say he will be the better for it. There\'s the\r\ndinner-bell.\'\r\n\r\nTo her surprise, she found his arm round her waist, and a kiss on her\r\nbrow.  \'I thought I should have caught it,\' he said; \'you are not half\r\na fool of a sister after all.\'\r\n\r\nAubrey was not in the dining-room; and after having carved, Tom, in\r\nsome compunction, was going to look for him, when he made his\r\nappearance in his uniform.\r\n\r\n\'Oho!\' said the Doctor, surprised.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s to be a grand parade with the Whitford division,\' he answered;\r\nand no more was said.\r\n\r\nNot till the eight o\'clock twilight of the dripping August evening did\r\nthe family reassemble.  Ethel had been preparing for a journey that\r\nMary and Gertrude were to make to Maplewood; and she did not come down\r\ntill her father had returned, when following him into the drawing-room,\r\nshe heard his exclamation, \'Winter again!\'\r\n\r\nFor the fire was burning, Tom was sitting crumpled over it, with his\r\nfeet on the fender, and his elbows on his knees, and Aubrey in his\r\nfather\'s arm-chair, his feet over the side, so fast asleep that neither\r\nentrance nor exclamation roused him; the room was pervaded with an\r\nodour of nutmeg and port wine, and a kettle, a decanter, and empty\r\ntumblers told tales.  Now the Doctor was a hardy and abstemious man, of\r\na water-drinking generation; and his wife\'s influence had further\r\ntended to make him--indulgent as he was--scornful of whatever savoured\r\nof effeminacy or dissipation, so his look and tone were sharp, and\r\ndisregardful of Aubrey\'s slumbers.\r\n\r\n\'We got wet through,\' said Tom; \'he was done up, had a shivering fit,\r\nand I tried to prevent mischief.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hm! said the Doctor, not mollified.  \'Cold is always the excuse. But\r\nanother time don\'t teach your brother to make this place like a fast\r\nman\'s rooms.\'\r\n\r\nEthel was amazed at Tom\'s bearing this so well.  With the slightest\r\npossible wrinkle of the skin of his forehead, he took up the decanter\r\nand carried it off to the cellaret.\r\n\r\n\'How that boy sleeps!\' said his father, looking at him.\r\n\r\n\'He has had such bad nights!\' said Ethel.  \'Don\'t be hard on Tom, he is\r\nvery good about such things, and would not have done it without need.\r\nHe is so careful of Aubrey!\'\r\n\r\n\'Too careful by half,\' said the Doctor, smiling placably as his son\r\nreturned.  \'You are all in a league to spoil that youngster.  He would\r\nbe better if you would not try your hand on his ailments, but would\r\nknock him about.\'\r\n\r\n\'I never do that without repenting it,\' said Tom; then, after a pause,\r\n\'It is not spirit that is wanting, but you would have been frightened\r\nyourself at his state of exhaustion.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of collapse, don\'t you mean?\' said the Doctor, with a little lurking\r\nsmile.  \'However, it is vexatious enough; he had been gaining ground\r\nall the year, and now he is regularly beaten down again.\'\r\n\r\n\'Suppose I was to take him for a run on the Continent?\'\r\n\r\n\'What, tired of the hospital?\'\r\n\r\n\'A run now and then is duty, not pleasure,\' replied Tom, quietly; while\r\nEthel burnt to avert from him these consequences of his peculiar\r\npreference for appearing selfish.\r\n\r\n\'So much for railway days!  That will be a new doctrine at\r\nStoneborough.  Well, where do you want to go?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t want to go anywhere.\'\r\n\r\nEthel would not have wondered to see him more sullen than he looked at\r\nthat moment.  It was lamentable that those two never could understand\r\neach other, and that either from Tom\'s childish faults, his resemblance\r\nto his grandfather, or his habitual reserve, Dr. May was never free\r\nfrom a certain suspicion of ulterior motives on his part.  She was\r\nrelieved at the influx of the rest of the party, including Richard; and\r\nAubrey wakening, was hailed with congratulations on the soundness of\r\nhis sleep, whilst she looked at Tom with a meaning smile as she saw her\r\nfather quietly feel the boy\'s hand and brow.  The whole family were\r\nalways nursing the lad, and scolding one another for it.\r\n\r\nTom had put himself beside Ethel, under the shade of her urn, and she\r\nperceived that he was ill at ease, probably uncertain whether any\r\nconfidences had been bestowed on her or Mary from the other side. There\r\nwas no hope that the topic would be avoided, for Richard began with\r\ninquiries for Averil.\r\n\r\n\'She is working herself to death,\' said Mary, sadly; \'but she says it\r\nsuits her.\'\r\n\r\n\'And it does,\' said the Doctor; \'she is stronger every day.  There is\r\nnothing really the matter with her.\'\r\n\r\n\'Contrary blasts keep a ship upright,\' said Gertrude, \'and she has them\r\nin abundance.  We found her in the midst of six people, all giving\r\ndiametrically opposite advice.\'\r\n\r\n\'Dr. Spencer was really helping, and Mr. Wright was there about his own\r\naffairs,\' said Ethel, in a tone of repression.\r\n\r\n\'And Mrs. Ledwich wanted her to settle on the Ohio to assist the\r\nrunaway slaves,\' continued Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\'It does not tease her as if she heard it,\' said Mary.\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said the Doctor, \'she moves about like one in a dream, and has no\r\ninstinct but to obey her brother.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I am glad to be going,\' said Daisy; \'it will be flat when all\r\nthe excitement is over, and we have not the fun of seeing Tom getting\r\nrises out of Ave Ward.\'\r\n\r\nThis time Tom could not repress a sudden jerk, and Ethel silenced her\r\nsister by a hint that such references were not nice when people were in\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n\'By the bye,\' said Aubrey, \'speaking of going away, what were you\r\nsaying while I was asleep? or was it a dream that I was looking through\r\nTom\'s microscope at a rifle bullet in the Tyrol?\'\r\n\r\n\'An inspiration from Tom\'s brew,\' said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\'Weren\'t you saying anything?\' said Aubrey, eagerly.  \'I\'m sure there\r\nwas something about duty and pleasure.  Were you really talking of it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Tom was, and if it is to put some substance into those long useless\r\nlegs, I don\'t care if you do start off.\'\r\n\r\nAubrey flashed into a fresh being.  He had just been reading a book\r\nabout the Tyrol, and Tom not caring at all where they were to go, this\r\ngave the direction.  Aubrey rushed to borrow a continental Bradshaw\r\nfrom Dr. Spencer, and the plan rapidly took form; with eager\r\nsuggestions thrown in by every one, ending with the determination to\r\nstart on the next Monday morning.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s settled,\' said Tom, wearily, when he and Ethel, as often\r\nhappened, had lingered behind the rest; \'only, Ethel, there\'s one\r\nthing.  You must keep your eye on the Vintry Mill, and fire off a\r\nletter to me if the fellow shows any disposition to bolt.\'\r\n\r\n\'If I can possibly find out--\'\r\n\r\n\'Keep your eyes open; and then Hazlitt has promised to let me know if\r\nthat cheque of Bilson\'s is cashed.  If I am away, telegraph, and\r\nmeantime set my father on the scent.  It may not hang that dog himself,\r\nbut it may save Leonard.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, if it would come!\'\r\n\r\n\'And meantime--silence, you know--\'\r\n\r\n\'Very well;\' then lingering, \'Tom, I am sure you did the right thing by\r\nAubrey, and so was papa afterwards.\'\r\n\r\nHis brow darkened for a moment, but shaking it off he said, \'I\'ll do my\r\nbest for your cosset lamb, and bring him back in condition.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you; I had rather trust him with you than any one.\'\r\n\r\n\'And how is it that no one proposes a lark for you, old Ethel?\' said\r\nTom, holding her so as to study her face.  \'You look awfully elderly\r\nand ragged.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I\'m going to be left alone with the Doctor, and that will be the\r\ngreatest holiday I ever had.\'\r\n\r\n\'I suppose it is to you,\' said Tom, with a deep heavy sigh, perhaps\r\nglad to have some ostensible cause for sighing.\r\n\r\n\'Dear Tom, when you are living here, and working with him--\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah--h!\' he said almost with disgust, \'don\'t talk of slavery to me\r\nbefore my time.  How I hate it, and everything else!  Good night!\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor Tom!\' thought Ethel.  \'I wish papa knew him better and would not\r\ngoad him.  Will Averil ever wake to see what she has done, and feel for\r\nhim?  Though I don\'t know why I should wish two people to be unhappy\r\ninstead of one, and there is weight enough already.  O, Leonard, I\r\nwonder if your one bitter affliction will shield you from the others\r\nthat may be as trying, and more tempting!\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n  All bright hopes and hues of day\r\n  Have faded into twilight gray.--Christian Year\r\n\r\n\r\n\'No fear of Aubrey\'s failing,\' said Tom; \'he has a better foundation\r\nthan nine-tenths of the lads that go up, and he is working like a man.\'\r\n\r\n\'He always did work heartily,\' said Ethel, \'and with pleasure in his\r\nwork.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ay, like a woman.\'\r\n\r\n\'Like a scholar.\'\r\n\r\n\'A scholar is a kind of woman.  A man, when he\'s a boy, only works\r\nbecause he can\'t help it, and afterwards for what he can get by it.\'\r\n\r\n\'For what he can do with it would have a worthier sound.\'\r\n\r\n\'Sound or sense, it is all the same.\'\r\n\r\n\'Scaffolding granted, what is the building?\'\r\n\r\nTom apparently thought it would be working like a woman to give himself\r\nthe trouble of answering; and Ethel went on in her own mind, \'For the\r\nwork\'s own sake--for what can be got by it--for what can be done with\r\nit--because it can\'t be helped--are--these all the springs of labour\r\nhere?  Then how is work done in that solitary cell?  Is it because it\r\ncan\'t be helped, or is it \'as the Lord\'s freeman\'?  And when he can\r\nhear of Aubrey\'s change, will he take it as out of his love, or grieve\r\nfor having been the cause?\'\r\n\r\nFor the change had been working in Aubrey ever since Leonard had\r\naltered his career.  The boy was at a sentimental age, and had the\r\nsusceptibility inseparable from home breeding; his desire to become a\r\nclergyman had been closely connected with the bright visions of the\r\nhappy days at Coombe, and had begun to wane with the first thwarting of\r\nLeonard\'s plans; and when the terrible catastrophe of the one friend\'s\r\nlife occurred, the other became alienated from all that they had hoped\r\nto share together.  Nor could even Dr. May\'s household be so wholly\r\nexempt from the spirit of the age, that Aubrey was not aware of the\r\nstrivings and trials of faith at the University.  He saw what Harvey\r\nAnderson was, and knew what was passing in the world; and while free\r\nfrom all doubts, shrank boyishly from the investigations that he\r\nfancied might excite them.  Or perhaps these fears of possible scruples\r\nwere merely his self-justification for gratifying his reluctance.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, he came home from his two months\' tour, brown, robust,\r\nwith revived spirits, but bent on standing an examination for the\r\nacademy at Woolwich.  He had written about it several times before his\r\nreturn, and his letters were, as his father said, \'so appallingly\r\nsensible that perhaps he would change his mind.\'  But it was not\r\nchanged when he came home; and Ethel, though sorely disappointed, was\r\nconvinced by her own sense as well as by Richard\'s prudence, that\r\ninterference was dangerous.  No one in Israel was to go forth to the\r\nwars of the Lord save those who \'willingly offered themselves;\' and\r\nthough grieved that her own young knight should be one of the many\r\nchampions unwilling to come forth in the Church\'s cause, she remembered\r\nthe ordeal to Norman\'s faith, and felt that the exertion of her\r\ninfluence was too great a responsibility.\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t like this,\' said Tom, after a pause.  \'It is not my doing,\r\nyou know.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, I did not suppose it was,\' said Ethel.  \'You would not withhold\r\nany one in these days of exceeding want of able clergymen.\'\r\n\r\n\'I told him it would be a grief at home,\' added Tom, \'but when a lad\r\ngets into that desperate mood, he always may be a worse grief if you\r\nthwart him; and I give you credit, Ethel, you have not pulled the curb.\'\r\n\r\n\'Richard told me not.\'\r\n\r\n\'Richard represents the common sense of the family when I am not at\r\nhome.\'\r\n\r\nTom was going the next day to his course of study at the London\r\nhospitals, and this--the late afternoon--was the first time that he and\r\nhis sister had been alone together.  He had been for some little time\r\nhaving these short jerks of conversation, beginning and breaking off\r\nrather absently.  At last he said, \'Do those people ever write?\'\r\n\r\n\'Prisoners, do you mean?  Not for three months.\'\r\n\r\n\'No--exiles.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mary has heard twice.\'\r\n\r\nHe held out Mary\'s little leathern writing-case to her.\r\n\r\n\'O, Tom!\'\r\n\r\n\'It is only Mary.\'\r\n\r\nEthel accepted the plea, aware that there could be no treason between\r\nherself and Mary, and moreover that the letters had been read by all\r\nthe family.  She turned the key, looked them out, and standing by the\r\nwindow to catch the light, began to read--\r\n\r\n\'You need not be afraid, kind Mary,\' wrote Averil, on the first days of\r\nher voyage; \'I am quite well, as well as a thing can be whose heart is\r\ndried up.  I am hardened past all feeling, and seem to be made of\r\nIndia-rubber.  Even my colour has returned--how I hate to see it, and\r\nto hear people say my roses will surprise the delicate Americans.\r\nFancy, in a shop in London I met an old school-fellow, who was\r\ndelighted to see me, talked like old times, and insisted on knowing\r\nwhere we were staying.  I used to be very fond of her, but it was as if\r\nI had been dead and was afraid she would find out I was a ghost, yet I\r\ntalked quite indifferently, and never faltered in my excuses.  When we\r\nembarked, it was no use to know it was the last of England, where _he_\r\nand you and home and life were left.  How I envied the poor girl, who\r\nwas crying as if her heart would break!\'\r\n\r\nOn those very words, broke the announcement of Mr. Cheviot.  Tom coolly\r\nheld out his hand for the letters, so much as a matter of course, that\r\nEthel complied with his gesture, and he composedly pocketed them, while\r\nshe felt desperately guilty.  Mary\'s own entrance would have excited no\r\ncompunction, Ethel would have said that Tom wanted to hear of the\r\nvoyage; but in the present case, she could only blush, conscious that\r\nthe guest recognized her sister\'s property, and was wondering what\r\nbusiness she had with it, and she was unwilling to explain, not only on\r\nTom\'s account, but because she knew that Mr. Cheviot greatly\r\ndisapproved of petitioning against the remission of capital sentences,\r\nand thought her father under a delusion.\r\n\r\nAfter Tom\'s departure the next day, she found the letters in her\r\nwork-basket, and restored them to Mary, laughing over Mr. Cheviot\'s\r\nevident resentment at the detection of her doings.\r\n\r\n\'I think it looked rather funny,\' said Mary.\r\n\r\n\'I beg your pardon,\' said Ethel, much astonished; \'but I thought, as\r\nevery one else had seen them--\'\r\n\r\n\'Tom always laughed at poor Ave.\'\r\n\r\n\'He is very different now; but indeed, Mary, I am sorry, since you did\r\nnot like it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh!\' cried Mary, discomfited by Ethel\'s apology, \'indeed I did not\r\nmean that, I wish I had not said anything.  You know you are welcome to\r\ndo what you please with all I have.  Only,\' she recurred, \'you can\'t\r\nwonder that Mr. Cheviot thought it funny.\'\r\n\r\n\'If he had any call to think at all,\' said Ethel, who was one of those\r\nwho thought that Charles Cheviot had put a liberal interpretation on\r\nDr. May\'s welcome to Stoneborough.  He had arrived after the summer\r\nholidays as second master of the school, and at Christmas was to\r\nsucceed Dr. Hoxton, who had been absolutely frightened from his chair\r\nby the commissions of inquiry that had beset the Whichcote foundation;\r\nand in compensation was at present perched on the highest niche sacred\r\nto conservative martyrdom in Dr. May\'s loyal heart.\r\n\r\nCharles Cheviot was a very superior man, who had great influence with\r\nyoung boys, and was admirably fitted to bring about the much required\r\nreformation in the school.  He came frequently to discuss his\r\nintentions with Dr. May, and his conversation was well worth being\r\nlistened to; but even the Doctor found three evenings in a week a large\r\nallowance for good sense and good behaviour--the evenings treated as\r\ninviolable even by old friends like Dr. Spencer and Mr. Wilmot, the\r\nfast waning evenings of Aubrey\'s home life.\r\n\r\nThe rest were reduced to silence, chess, books, and mischief, except\r\nwhen a treat of facetious small talk was got up for their benefit. Any\r\nattempt of the ladies to join in the conversation was replied to with a\r\ncondescending levity that reduced Ethel to her girlhood\'s awkward sense\r\nof forwardness and presumption; Mary was less disconcerted, because her\r\nremarks were never so aspiring, and Harry\'s wristbands sufficed her;\r\nbut the never-daunted Daisy rebelled openly, related the day\'s events\r\nto her papa, fearless of any presence, and when she had grown tired of\r\nthe guest\'s regular formula of expecting to meet Richard, she told him\r\nthat the adult school always kept Richard away in the winter evenings;\r\n\'But if you want to see him, he is always to be found at Cocksmoor, and\r\nhe would be very glad of help.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did he express any such wish?\' said Mr. Cheviot, looking rather\r\npuzzled.\r\n\r\n\'Oh dear, no; only I thought you had so much time on your hands.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh no--oh no!\' exclaimed Mary, in great confusion, \'Gertrude did not\r\nmean--I am sure I don\'t know what she was thinking of.\'\r\n\r\nAnd at the first opportunity, Mary, for once in her life, administered\r\nto Gertrude a richly-deserved reproof for sauciness and contempt of\r\nimproving conversation; but the consequence was a fancy of the idle\r\nyounglings to make Mary accountable for the \'infesting of their\r\nevenings,\' and as she was always ready to afford sport to the\r\nhousehold, they thus obtained a happy outlet for their drollery and\r\ndiscontent, and the imputation was the more comical from his apparent\r\nindifference and her serene composure; until one evening when, as the\r\nbell rung, and mutterings passed between Aubrey and Gertrude, of \'Day\r\nset,\' and \'Cheviot\'s mountains lone,\' the head of the family, for the\r\nfirst time, showed cognizance of the joke, and wearily taking down his\r\nslippered feet from their repose, said, \'Lone! yes, there\'s the rub!  I\r\nshall have to fix days of reception if Mary will insist on being so\r\nattractive.\'\r\n\r\nMary, with an instinct that she was blamed, began to be very sorry, but\r\nbroke off amid peals of merriment, and blushes that were less easily\r\nextinguished; and which caused Ethel to tell each of the young ones\r\nprivately, that their sport was becoming boy and frog work, and she\r\nwould have no more of it.  The Daisy was inclined to be restive; but\r\nEthel told her that many people thought this kind of fun could never be\r\nsafe or delicate.  \'I have always said that it might be quite harmless,\r\nif people knew where to stop--now show me that I am right.\'\r\n\r\nAnd to Aubrey she put the question, whether he would like to encourage\r\nDaisy in being a nineteenth-century young lady without reticence?\r\n\r\nHowever, as Mary heard no more of their mischievous wit, Ethel was\r\nquite willing to let them impute to herself a delusion that the\r\nschoolmaster was smitten with Mary, and to laugh with them in private\r\nover all the ridiculous things they chose to say.\r\n\r\nAt last Flora insisted on Ethel\'s coming with her to make a distant\r\ncall, and, as soon as they were in the carriage, said, \'It was not only\r\nfor the sake of Mrs. Copeland, though it is highly necessary you should\r\ngo, but it is the only way of ever speaking to you, and I want to know\r\nwhat all this is about Mary?\'\r\n\r\n\'The children have not been talking their nonsense to you!\'\r\n\r\n\'No one ever talks nonsense to me--intentionally, I mean--not even you,\r\nEthel; I wish you did.  But I hear it is all over the town. George has\r\nbeen congratulated, and so have I, and one does not like contradicting\r\nonly to eat it up again.\'\r\n\r\n\'You always did hear everything before it was true, Flora.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then is it going to be true?\'\r\n\r\n\'O, Flora, can it be possible?\' said Ethel, with a startled, astonished\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n\'Possible!  Highly obvious and proper, as it seems to me.  The only\r\ndoubt in my mind was whether it were not too obvious to happen.\'\r\n\r\n\'He is always coming in,\' said Ethel, \'but I never thought it was\r\nreally for that mischief!  The children only laugh about it as the most\r\npreposterous thing they can think of, for he never speaks to a woman if\r\nhe can help it.\'\r\n\r\n\'That may not prevent him from wanting a good wife.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wanting a wife--ay, as he would want a housekeeper, just because he\r\nhas got to the proper position for it; but is he to go and get our\r\nbonny Mary in that way, just for an appendage to the mastership?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well done, old Ethel!  I\'m glad to see you so like yourself.  I\r\nremember when we thought Mrs. Hoxton\'s position very sublime.\'\r\n\r\n\'I never thought of positions!\'\r\n\r\n\'Never!  I know that very well; and I am not thinking of it now, except\r\nas an adjunct to a very worthy man, whom Mary will admire to the depths\r\nof her honest heart, and who will make her very happy.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I suppose if she once begins to like him, that he will,\' said\r\nEthel, slowly; \'but I can\'t bring myself to swallow it yet.  She has\r\nnever given in to his being a bore, but I thought that was her\r\nuniversal benevolence; and he says less to her than to any one.\'\r\n\r\n\'Depend upon it, he thinks he is proceeding selon les regles.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then he ought to be flogged!  Has he any business to think of my Mary,\r\nwithout falling red-hot in love with her?  Why, Hector was regularly\r\ncrazy that last half-year; and dear old Polly is worth ever so much\r\nmore than Blanche.\'\r\n\r\n\'I must say you have fulfilled my desire of hearing you talk nonsense,\r\nEthel.  Mary would never think of those transports.\'\r\n\r\n\'She deserves them all the more.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, she is the party most concerned, though she will be a cruel loss\r\nto all of us.\'\r\n\r\n\'She will not go far, if--\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, but she will be the worse loss.  You simple Ethel, you don\'t\r\nthink that Charles Cheviot will let her be the dear family fag we have\r\nalways made of her?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh no--that always was wrong.\'\r\n\r\n\'And living close by, she will not come on a visit, all festal, to\r\nresume home habits.  No, you must make up your mind, Ethel--_if,_ as\r\nyou say, _if_--he will be a man for monopolies, and he will resent\r\nanything that he thinks management from you.  I suspect it is a real\r\nsign of the love that you deny, that he has ventured on the sister of a\r\nclever woman, living close by, and a good deal looked up to.\'\r\n\r\n\'Flora, Flora, you should not make one wicked.  If she is to be happy,\r\nwhy can\'t you let me rejoice freely, and only have her drawn off from\r\nme bit by bit, in the right way of nature?\'\r\n\r\n\'I did not tell you to make you dislike it--of course not.  Only I\r\nthought that a little tact, a little dexterity, might prevent Charles\r\nCheviot from being so much afraid of you, as if he saw at once how\r\nreally the head of the family you are.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nonsense, Flora, I am no such thing.  If I am domineering, the sooner\r\nany one sees it and takes me down the better.  If this does come, I\r\nwill try to behave as I ought, and not to mind so Mary is happy; but I\r\ncan\'t act, except just as the moment leads me.  I hope it will soon be\r\nover, now you have made me begin to believe in it. I am afraid it will\r\nspoil Harry\'s pleasure at home!  Poor dear Harry, what will he do?\'\r\n\r\n\'When does he come?\'\r\n\r\n\'Any day now; he could not quite tell when he could get away.\r\n\r\nWhen they came back, and Dr. May ran out to say, \'Can you come in.\r\nFlora? we want you,\' the sisters doubted whether his excitement were\r\ndue to the crisis, or to the arrival.  He hurried them into the study,\r\nand shut the door, exulting and perplexed.  \'You girls leave one no\r\nrest,\' he said.  \'Here I have had this young Cheviot telling me that\r\nthe object of his attentions has been apparent.  I\'m sure I did not\r\nknow if it were Mab or one of you.  I thought he avoided all alike; and\r\npoor Mary was so taken by surprise that she will do nothing but cry,\r\nand say, "No, never;" and when I tell her she shall do as she pleases,\r\nshe cries the more; or if I ask her if I am to say Yes, she goes into\r\necstasies of crying!  I wish one of you would go up, and see if you can\r\ndo anything with her.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is he about the house?\' asked Flora, preparing to obey.\r\n\r\n\'No--I was obliged to tell him that she must have time, and he is gone\r\nhome.  I am glad he should have a little suspense--he seemed to make so\r\ncertain of her.  Did he think he was making love all the time he was\r\nboring me with his gas in the dormitories?  I hope she will serve him\r\nout!\'\r\n\r\n\'He will not be the worse for not being a lady\'s man,\' said Flora, at\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nBut in ten minutes, Flora returned with the same report of nothing but\r\ntears; and she was obliged to leave the party to their perplexity, and\r\ndrive home; while Ethel went in her turn to use all manner of pleas to\r\nher sister to cheer up, know her own mind, and be sure that they only\r\nwished to guess what would make her happiest.  To console or to scold\r\nwere equally unsuccessful, and after attempting all varieties of\r\ntreatment, bracing or tender, Ethel found that the only approach to\r\ncalm was produced by the promise that she should be teased no more that\r\nevening, but be left quite alone to recover, and cool her burning eyes\r\nand aching head.  So, lighting her fire, shaking up a much-neglected\r\neasy-chair, bathing her eves, desiring her not to come down to tea, and\r\nengaging both that Gertrude should not behold her, and that papa would\r\nnot be angry, provided that she tried to know what she really wished,\r\nand be wiser on the morrow, Ethel left her.  The present concern was\r\nabsolutely more to persuade her to give an answer of some sort, than\r\nwhat that answer should be. Ethel would not wish; Dr. May had very\r\nlittle doubt; and Gertrude, from whom there was no concealing the state\r\nof affairs, observed, \'If she cries so much the first time she has to\r\nknow her own mind, it shows she can\'t do without some one to do it for\r\nher.\'\r\n\r\nThe evening passed in expeditions of Ethel\'s to look after her patient,\r\nand in desultory talk on all that was probable and improbable between\r\nDr. May and the younger ones, until just as Ethel was coming down at\r\nnine o\'clock with the report that she had persuaded Mary to go to bed,\r\nshe was startled by the street door being opened as far as the chain\r\nwould allow, and a voice calling, \'I say, is any one there to let me\r\nin?\'\r\n\r\n\'Harry!  O, Harry! I\'m coming;\' and she had scarcely had time to shut\r\nthe door previous to taking down the chain, before the three others\r\nwere in the hall, the tumult of greetings breaking forth.\r\n\r\n\'But where\'s Polly?\' he asked, as soon as he was free to look round\r\nthem all.\r\n\r\n\'Going to bed with a bad headache,\' was the answer, with which Daisy\r\nhad sense enough not to interfere; and the sailor had been brought into\r\nthe drawing-room, examined on his journey, and offered supper, before\r\nhe returned to the charge.\r\n\r\n\'Nothing really the matter with Mary, I hope?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! no--nothing.\'\r\n\r\n\'Can\'t I go up and see her?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not just at present,\' said Ethel.  \'I will see how she is when she is\r\nin bed, but if she is going to sleep, we had better not disturb her.\'\r\n\r\n\'Harry thinks she must sleep better for the sight of him,\' said the\r\nDoctor; \'but it is a melancholy business.--Harry, your nose is out of\r\njoint.\'\r\n\r\n\'Who is it?\' said Harry, gravely.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! you have chosen a bad time to come home.  We shall know no comfort\r\ntill it is over.\'\r\n\r\n\'Who?\' cried Harry; \'no nonsense, Gertrude, I can\'t stand guessing.\'\r\n\r\nThis was directed to Gertrude, who was only offending by pursed lips\r\nand twinkling eyes, because he could not fall foul of his father. Dr.\r\nMay took pity, and answered at once.\r\n\r\n\'Cheviot!\' cried Harry.  \'Excellent!  He always did know how to get the\r\nbest of everything.  Polly turning into a Mrs. Hoxton.  Ha! ha! Well,\r\nthat is a relief to my mind.\'\r\n\r\n\'You did look rather dismayed, certainly.  What were you afraid of?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, when that poor young Leonard Ward\'s business was in the papers, a\r\nmessmate of mine was asked if we were not all very much interested,\r\nbecause of some attachment between some of us.  I thought he must mean\r\nme or Tom, for I was tremendously smitten with that sweet pretty girl,\r\nand I used to be awfully jealous of Tom, but when I heard of Mary going\r\nto bed with a headache, and that style of thing, I began to doubt, and\r\nI couldn\'t stand her taking up with such a dirty little nigger as Henry\r\nWard was at school.\'\r\n\r\n\'I think you might have known Mary better!\' exclaimed Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\'And it\'s not Tom either?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'Exactly the reverse,\' laughed his father.\r\n\r\n\'Well, Tom is a sly fellow, and he had a knack of turning up whenever\r\none wanted to do a civil thing by that poor girl.  Where is she now?\'\r\n\r\n\'At New York.\'\r\n\r\n\'They\'d better take care how they send me to watch the Yankees, then.\'\r\n\r\n\'Your passion does not alarm me greatly,\' laughed the Doctor.  \'I don\'t\r\nthink it ever equalled that for the reigning ship.  I hope there\'s a\r\nvacancy in that department for the present, and that we may have you at\r\nhome a little.\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed, sir, I\'m afraid not,\' said Harry.  \'I saw Captain Gordon at\r\nPortsmouth this morning, and he tells me he is to go out in the Clio to\r\nthe Pacific station, and would apply for me as his first lieutenant, if\r\nI liked to look up the islands again.  So, if you have any commissions\r\nfor Norman, I\'m your man.\r\n\r\n\'And how soon?\'\r\n\r\n\'Uncertain--but Cheviot and Mary must settle their affairs in good\r\ntime; I\'ve missed all the weddings in the family hitherto, and won\'t be\r\nbalked of Polly\'s.  I say, Ethel, you can\'t mean me not to go and wish\r\nher joy.\'\r\n\r\n\'We are by no means come to joy yet,\' said Ethel; \'poor Mary is overset\r\nby the suddenness of the thing.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, I thought it was all fixed.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothing less so,\' said the Doctor.  \'One would think it was a naiad\r\nthat had had an offer from the mountains next, for she has been\r\nshedding a perfect river of tears ever since; and all that the united\r\ndiscernment of the family has yet gathered is, that she cries rather\r\nmore when we tell her she is right to say No than when we tell her she\r\nis right to say Yes.\'\r\n\r\n\'I declare, Ethel, you must let me go up to her.\'\r\n\r\n\'But, Harry, I promised she should hear no more about it to-night. You\r\nmust say nothing unless she begins.\'\r\n\r\nAnd thinking a quiet night\'s rest, free from further excitement, the\r\nbest chance of a rational day, Ethel was glad that her mission resulted\r\nin the report, \'Far too nearly asleep to be disturbed;\' but on the way\r\nup to bed, soft as Harry\'s foot-falls always were, a voice came down\r\nthe stairs, \'That\'s Harry!  Oh, come!\' and with a face of triumph\r\nturned back to meet Ethel\'s glance of discomfited warning, he bounded\r\nup, to be met by Mary in her dressing-gown.  \'O, Harry, why didn\'t you\r\ncome?\' as she threw her arms round his neck.\r\n\r\n\'They wouldn\'t let me.\'\r\n\r\n\'I did think I heard you; but when no one came I thought it was only\r\nRichard, till I heard the dear old step, and then I knew.  O, Harry!\'\r\nand still she gasped, with her head on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\'They said you must be quiet.\'\r\n\r\n\'O Harry! did you hear?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, indeed,\' holding her closer, \'and heartily glad I am; I know him\r\nas well as if I had sailed with him, and I could not wish you in better\r\nhands.\'\r\n\r\n\'But--O, Harry dear--\' and there was a struggle with a sob between each\r\nword, \'indeed--I won\'t--mind if you had rather not.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you mean that you don\'t like him?\'\r\n\r\n\'I should see him, you know, and perhaps he would not mind--he could\r\nalways come and talk to papa in the evenings.\'\r\n\r\n\'And is that what you want to put a poor man off with, Mary?\'\r\n\r\n\'Only--only--if you don\'t want me to--\'\r\n\r\n\'I not want you to--?  Why, Mary, isn\'t it the very best thing I could\r\nwant for you?  What are you thinking about?\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t you remember, when you came home after your wound, you said I--I\r\nmustn\'t--\' and she fell into such a paroxysm of crying that he had\r\nquite to hold her up in his arms, and though his voice was merry, there\r\nwas a moisture on his eyelashes.  \'Oh, you Polly!  You\'re a caution\r\nagainst deluding the infant mind!  Was that all?  Was that what made\r\nyou distract them all?  Why not have said so?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, never!  They would have said you were foolish.\'\r\n\r\n\'As I was for not knowing that you wouldn\'t understand that I only\r\nmeant you were to wait till the right one turned up.  Why, if I had\r\nbeen at Auckland, would you have cried till I came home?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I\'m sorry I was silly!  But I\'m glad you didn\'t mean it, dear\r\nHarry!\' squeezing him convulsively.\r\n\r\n\'There!  And now you\'ll sleep sound, and meet them as fresh as a fair\r\nwind to-morrow.  Eh?\'\r\n\r\n\'Only please tell papa I\'m sorry I worried him.\'\r\n\r\n\'And how about somebody else, Mary, whom you\'ve kept on tenter-hooks\r\never so long?  Are you sure he is not walking up and down under the\r\nlimes on the brink of despair?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, do you think--? But he would not be so foolish!\'\r\n\r\n\'There now, go to sleep.  I\'ll settle it all for you, and I shan\'t let\r\nany one say you are a goose but myself.  Only sleep, and get those\r\nhorrid red spots away from under your eyes, or perhaps he\'ll repent his\r\nbargain, said Harry, kissing each red spot.  \'Promise you\'ll go to bed\r\nthe instant I\'m gone.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said Dr. May, looking out of his room, \'I augur that the spirit\r\nof the flood has something to say to the spirit of the fell.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should think so!  Genuine article--no mistake.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then what was all this about?\'\r\n\r\n\'All my fault.  Some rhodomontade of mine about not letting her marry\r\nhad cast anchor in her dear little ridiculous heart, and it is well I\r\nturned up before she had quite dissolved herself away.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is that really all?\'\r\n\r\n\'The sum total of the whole, as sure as--\' said Harry, pausing for an\r\nasseveration, and ending with \'as sure as your name is Dick May;\'\r\nwhereat they both fell a-laughing, though they were hardly drops of\r\nlaughter that Harry brushed from the weather-marked pucker in the comer\r\nof his eyes; and Dr. May gave a sigh of relief, and said, \'Well, that\'s\r\nright!\'\r\n\r\n\'Where\'s the latch-key?  I must run down and put Cheviot out of his\r\nmisery.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is eleven o\'clock, he\'ll be gone to bed.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then I would forbid the banns.  Where does he hang out?  Has he got\r\ninto old Hoxton\'s?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, it is being revivified.  He is at Davis\'s lodgings.  But I advise\r\nyou not, a little suspense will do him good.\'\r\n\r\n\'One would think you had never been in love,\' said Harry, indignantly.\r\n\'At least, I can\'t sleep till I\'ve shaken hands with the old fellow.\r\nGood night, father.  I\'ll not be long.\'\r\n\r\nHe kept his word, and the same voice greeted him out of the\r\ndressing-room: \'How was the spirit of the fell?  Sleep\'st thou,\r\nbrother?\'\r\n\r\n\'Brother, nay,\' answered Harry, \'he was only looking over Latin verses!\r\nHe always was a cool hand.\'\r\n\r\n\'The spirit of the Fell--Dr. Fell, with a vengeance,\' said Dr. May. \'I\r\nsay, Harry, is this going to be a mere business transaction on his\r\npart?  Young folks have not a bit of romance in these days, and one\r\ndoes not know where to have them; but if I thought--\'\r\n\r\n\'You may be sure of him, sir,\' said Harry, speaking the more eagerly\r\nbecause he suspected the impression his own manner had made; \'he is\r\nthoroughly worthy, and feels Mary\'s merits pretty nearly as much as I\r\ndo.  More, perhaps, I ought to say.  There\'s more warmth in him than\r\nshows.  I don\'t know that Norman ever could have gone through that\r\nterrible time after the accident, but for the care he took of him. And\r\nthat little brother of his that sailed with me in the Eurydice, and\r\ndied at Singapore--I know how he looked to his brother Charles, and I\r\ndo assure you, father, you could not put the dear Mary into safer,\r\nsounder hands, or where she could be more prized or happier. He is\r\ncoming up to-morrow morning, and you\'ll see he is in earnest in spite\r\nof all his set speeches.  Good night, father; I am glad to be in time\r\nfor the last of my Polly.\'\r\n\r\nThis was almost the only moment at which Harry betrayed a consciousness\r\nthat his Polly was less completely his own.  And yet it seemed as if it\r\nmust have been borne in on him again and again, for Mary awoke the next\r\nmorning as thoroughly, foolishly, deeply in love as woman could be, and\r\nwent about comporting herself in the most comically commonplace style,\r\nforgetting and neglecting everything, not hearing nor seeing, making\r\nabsurd mistakes, restless whenever Mr. Cheviot was not present, and\r\nthen perfectly content if he came to sit by her, as he always did; for\r\nhis courtship--now it had fairly begun--was equally exclusive and\r\ndetermined.  Every day they walked or rode together, almost every\r\nevening he came and sat by her, and on each holiday they engrossed the\r\ndrawing-room, Mary looking prettier than she had ever been seen before;\r\nAubrey and Gertrude both bored and critical; Harry treating the whole\r\nas a pantomime got up for his special delectation, and never betokening\r\nany sense that Mary was neglecting him.  It was the greatest help to\r\nEthel in keeping up the like spirit, under the same innocent\r\nunconscious neglect from the hitherto devoted Mary, who was only\r\nhelpful in an occasional revival of mechanical instinct in lucid\r\nintervals, and then could not be depended on.  To laugh good-naturedly\r\nand not bitterly, to think the love-making pretty and not foolish, to\r\nrepress Gertrude\'s saucy scorn, instead of encouraging it, would have\r\nbeen far harder without the bright face of the brother who generously\r\nsurrendered instead of repining.\r\n\r\nShe never told herself that there was no proportion between the trials,\r\nnot only because her spirits still suffered from the ever-present load\r\nof pity at her heart, nor because the loss would be hourly to her, but\r\nalso because Charles Cheviot drew Harry towards him, but kept her at a\r\ndistance, or more truly laughed her down.  She was used to be laughed\r\nat; her ways had always been a matter of amusement to her brothers, and\r\nperhaps it was the natural assumption of brotherhood to reply to any\r\nsuggestion or remark of hers with something intended for drollery, and\r\nfollowed with a laugh, which, instead of as usual stirring her up to\r\ngood-humoured repartee, suppressed her, and made her feel foolish and\r\nawkward.  As to Flora\'s advice, to behave with tact, she could not if\r\nshe would, she would not if she could; in principle she tried to\r\nacquiesce in a man\'s desire to show that he meant to have his wife to\r\nhimself, and in practice she accepted his extinguisher because she\r\ncould not help it.\r\n\r\nMr. Cheviot was uneasy about the chances of Aubrey\'s success in the\r\nexamination at Woolwich, and offered assistance in the final\r\npreparation; but though Aubrey willingly accepted the proposal, two or\r\nthree violent headaches from over-study and anxiety made Dr. May insist\r\non his old regimen of entire holiday and absence of work for the last\r\nweek; to secure which repose, Aubrey was sent to London with Harry for\r\na week\'s idleness and the society of Tom, who professed to be too busy\r\nto come home even for Christmas.  Mr. Cheviot\'s opinion transpired\r\nthrough Mary, that it was throwing away Aubrey\'s only chance.\r\n\r\nIn due time came the tidings that Aubrey had the second largest number\r\nof marks, and had been highly commended for the thoroughness of his\r\nknowledge, so different from what had been only crammed for the\r\noccasion.  He had been asked who had been his tutor, and had answered,\r\n\'His brother,\' fully meaning to spare Ethel publicity; and she was\r\ngenuinely thankful for having been shielded under Tom\'s six months of\r\nteaching.  She heartily wished the same shield would have availed at\r\nhome, when Charles Cheviot gave that horrible laugh, and asked her if\r\nshe meant to stand for a professor\'s chair.  She faltered something\r\nabout Tom and mathematics.  \'Ay, ay,\' said Charles; \'and these military\r\nexaminations are in nothing but foreign languages and trash;\' and again\r\nhe laughed his laugh, and Mary followed his example.  Ethel would fain\r\nhave seen the fun.\r\n\r\n\'Eh, Cheviot, what two of a trade never agree?\' asked Dr. May, in high\r\nglory and glee.\r\n\r\n\'Not my trade, papa,\' said Ethel, restored by his face and voice, \'only\r\nthe peculiarity of examiners, so long ago remarked by Norman, of only\r\nsetting questions that one can answer.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not your trade, but your amateur work!\' said Mr. Cheviot, again\r\nexploding, and leaving Ethel to feel demolished.  Why, she wondered\r\npresently, had she not held up her knitting, and merrily owned it for\r\nher trade--why, but because those laughs took away all merriment, all\r\npresence of mind, all but the endeavour not to be as cross as she felt.\r\nWas this systematic, or was it only bad taste?\r\n\r\nThe wedding was fixed for Whitsuntide; the repairs and drainage\r\nnecessitating early and long holidays; and the arrangements gave full\r\noccupation.  Mary was the first daughter who had needed a portion,\r\nsince Mr. Cheviot was one of a large family, and had little of his own.\r\nDr. May had inherited a fair private competence, chiefly in land in and\r\nabout the town, and his professional gains, under his wife\'s prudent\r\nmanagement, had been for the most part invested in the like property.\r\nThe chief of his accumulation of ready money had been made over to\r\nestablish Richard at Cocksmoor; and though living in an inexpensive\r\nstyle, such as that none of the family knew what it was to find means\r\nlacking for aught that was right or reasonable, there was no large\r\namount of capital available.  The May custom had always been that the\r\nphysician should inherit the landed estate; and though this was\r\ndisproportionately increased by the Doctor\'s own acquisitions, yet the\r\nhold it gave over the town was so important, that he was unwilling it\r\nshould be broken up at his death, and wished to provide for his other\r\nchildren by charges on the rents, instead of by sale and division.  All\r\nthis he caused Richard to write to Tom, for though there was no\r\nabsolute need of the young man\'s concurrence in arranging Mary\'s\r\nsettlements, it was a good opportunity for distinctly stating his\r\nprospects, and a compliment to consult him.\r\n\r\nFeeling that Tom had thus been handsomely dealt with, his letter to his\r\nfather was the greater shock, when, after saying that he doubted\r\nwhether he could come home for the wedding, he expressed gratitude for\r\nthe opening held out to him, but begged that precedents applicable to\r\nvery different circumstances might not be regarded as binding.  He was\r\ndistressed at supplanting Richard, and would greatly prefer the\r\nproperty taking its natural course.  It would be so many years, he\r\ntrusted, before there would be room for his services, even as an\r\nassistant, at Stoneborough, that he thought it would be far more\r\nadvisable to seek some other field; and his own desire would be at once\r\nto receive a younger son\'s share, if it were but a few hundreds, and be\r\nfree to cut out his own line.\r\n\r\n\'What is he driving at, Ethel?\' asked the Doctor, much vexed.  \'I offer\r\nhim what any lad should jump at; and he only says, "Give me the portion\r\nof goods that falleth to me."  What does that mean?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not prodigality,\' said Ethel.  \'Remember what Sir Matthew Fleet said\r\nto Dr. Spencer--"Dick\'s ability and common sense besides."\'\r\n\r\n\'Exactly what makes me suspicious of his coming the disinterested over\r\nme.  There\'s something behind!  He is running into debt and destruction\r\namong that precious crew about the hospitals.\'\r\n\r\n\'Harry saw nothing wrong, and thought his friends in good style.\'\r\n\r\n\'Every one is in good style with Harry, happy fellow!  He is no more a\r\njudge than a child of six years old--carries too much sunshine to see\r\nshades.\'\r\n\r\n\'A lieutenant in the navy can hardly be the capital officer that our\r\nHarry is without some knowledge of men and discipline.\'\r\n\r\n\'I grant you, on his own element; but on shore he goes about in his\r\nholiday spectacles, and sees a bird of paradise in every cock-sparrow.\'\r\n\r\n\'Isn\'t _there_ a glass house that can sometimes make a swan?\' said\r\nEthel, slyly touching her father\'s spectacles; \'but with you both,\r\nthere\'s always a something to attract the embellishing process; and\r\nbetween Harry and Aubrey, Dr. Spencer and Sir Matthew, we could hardly\r\nfail to have heard of anything amiss.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t like it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then it is hard,\' said Ethel, with spirit.  \'So steady as he has\r\nalways been, he ought to have the benefit of a little trust.\'\r\n\r\n\'He was never like the others; I don\'t know what to be at with him! I\r\nshould not have minded but for that palaver about elder brothers.\'\r\n\r\nDefend as Ethel might, it was still with a misgiving lest\r\ndisappointment should have taken a wrong course.  It was hard to trust\r\nwhere correspondence was the merest business scrap, and neither\r\nChristmas nor the sister\'s marriage availed to call Tom home; and\r\nthough she had few fears as to dissipation, she did dread hardening and\r\nambition, all the more since she had learnt that Sir Matthew Fleet was\r\naffording to him a patronage unprecedented from that quarter.\r\n\r\nNo year of Etheldred May\'s life had been so trying as this last.  It\r\nseemed like her first step away from the aspirations of youth, into the\r\ngraver fears of womanhood.  With all the self-restraint that she had\r\nstriven to exercise at Coombe, it had been a time of glorious dreams\r\nover the two young spirits who seemed to be growing up by her side to\r\nbe faithful workers, destined to carry out her highest visions; and the\r\nboyish devotion of the one, the fraternal reverence of the other, had\r\nmade her very happy.  And now?  The first disappointment in Leonard had\r\nled--not indeed to less esteem for him, but to that pitying veneration\r\nthat could only be yielded by a sharing in spirit of the like\r\nmartyrdom; a continued thankfulness and admiration, but a continual\r\nwringing of the heart.  And her own child and pupil, Aubrey, had turned\r\naside from the highest path; and in the unavowed consciousness that he\r\nwas failing in the course he had so often traced out with her, and that\r\nall her aid and ready participation in his present interests were but\r\nfrom her outward not her inward heart, he had never argued the point\r\nwith her, never consulted her on his destination.  He had talked only\r\nto his father of his alteration of purpose, and had at least paid her\r\nthe compliment of not trying to make her profess that she was gratified\r\nby the change.  In minor matters, he depended on her as much as ever;\r\nbut Harry was naturally his chief companion, and the prime of his full\r\nand perfect confidence had departed, partly in the step from boy to\r\nman, but more from the sense that he was not fulfilling the soldiership\r\nhe had dreamt of with her, and that he had once led her to think his\r\ntalents otherwise dedicated.  She had few fears for his steadiness, but\r\nshe had some for his health, and he was something taken away from\r\nher--a brightness had faded from his image.\r\n\r\nAnd this marriage--with every effort at rejoicing and certainty of\r\nMary\'s present bliss and probability of future happiness, it was the\r\nloss of a sister, and not the gain of a brother, and Mr. Cheviot did\r\nhis utmost to render the absence of repining a great effort of\r\nunselfishness.  And even with her father, her possession of Tom\'s\r\nhalf-revealed secret seemed an impairing of absolute confidence; she\r\ncould not but hope that her father did her brother injustice, and in\r\nher tenderness towards them both this was a new and painful sensation.\r\nHer manner was bright and quaint as ever, her sayings perhaps less\r\nedged than usual, because the pain at her heart made her guard her\r\ntongue; but she had begun to feel middle-aged, and strangely lonely.\r\nRichard, though always a comfort, would not have entered into her\r\ntroubles; Harry, in his atmosphere of sailor on shore, had nothing of\r\nthe confidant, and engrossed his father; Mary and Aubrey were both gone\r\nfrom her, and Gertrude was still a child. She had never so longed after\r\nMargaret or Norman.  But at least her corner in the Minster, her table\r\nat home with her Bible and Prayer-Book, were still the same, and\r\nwitnessed many an outpouring of her anxiety, many a confession of the\r\nwords or gestures that she had felt to have been petulant, whether\r\nothers had so viewed them or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n  Long among them was seen a maiden, who waited and wondered,\r\n  Lowly and meek in spirit, and patiently suffering all things;\r\n  Fair was she, and young, but alas! before her extended,\r\n  Dreary and vast and silent, the desert of life.--Evangeline.\r\n                                                    LONGFELLOW\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Sister, sister! who is it?  Going to be married!  Oh, do tell us!\'\r\ncried Ella Warden--as she now was called--capering round her elder\r\nsister, who stood beneath a gas-burner, in a well-furnished bed-room,\r\nreading a letter, its enclosure clasped within a very trembling hand.\r\n\r\n\'Mary May, dear Mary,\' answered Averil, still half absently.\r\n\r\n\'And who?\'\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Cheviot,\' said Averil, thoroughly rousing herself, and, with a\r\nquick movement, concealing the enclosure in her bosom.  \'I remember\r\nhim; he was very good, when--\'\r\n\r\nAnd there she paused; while Ella chattered on: \'Oh, sister, if you were\r\nbut at home, you would be a bridesmaid now, and perhaps we should.\r\nLittle Miss Rivers was Mrs. Ernescliffe\'s bridesmaid.  Don\'t you\r\nremember, Minna, how we saw her in her little cashmere cloak?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, don\'t, Ella!\' escaped from Minna, like a cry of pain, as she leant\r\nback in a rocking-chair, and recollected who had held her up in his\r\narms to watch Blanche May\'s wedding procession.\r\n\r\n\'And how soon will she be married, sister, and where will she live?\'\r\nasked the much-excited Ella.\r\n\r\n\'She will be married in Whitsun week, and as he is headmaster, they\r\nwill live in Dr. Hoxton\'s house.  Dear, good Mary, how glad I am that\r\nshe is so full of happiness--her letter quite brims over with it!  I\r\nwonder if I may work anything to send her.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should like to send her some very beautiful thing indeed,\' cried\r\nElla, with emphasis, and eyes dilating at some visionary magnificence.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, I have nothing to send her but my love!  And I may send _her_ that\r\nstill,\' said Minna, looking up wistfully at Averil, who bent down and\r\nkissed her.\r\n\r\n\'And Ave won\'t let me send mine to Mr. Tom, though I\'m sure I do love\r\nhim the best of them all,\' said Ella.\r\n\r\n\'That wasn\'t--\' half whispered Minna, but turned her head away, with a\r\nsigh of oppression and look of resignation, sad in so young a child,\r\nthough, indeed, the infantine form was fast shooting into tall, lank\r\ngirlhood.  Ella went on: \'I shall send him the objects for his\r\nmicroscope, when I get into the country; for I promised, so sister\r\ncan\'t prevent me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, the country!--when shall we go there?\' sighed Minna.\r\n\r\n\'Your head aches to-night, my dear,\' said Averil, looking anxiously at\r\nher listless attitude, half-opened eyes, and the deep hollows above her\r\ncollar-bones.\r\n\r\n\'It always does after the gas is lighted,\' said the child, patiently,\r\n\'it is always so hot here.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is just like being always in the conservatory at the Grange,\' added\r\nElla.  \'I do hate this boarding-house.  It is very unkind of Henry to\r\nkeep us here--fifteen weeks now.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Ella,\' remonstrated Minna, \'you mustn\'t say that!\'\r\n\r\n\'But I shall say it,\' retorted Ella. \'Rosa Willis says what she\r\npleases, and so shall I.  I don\'t see the sense of being made a baby\r\nof, when every one else of our age eats all they like, and is consulted\r\nabout arrangements, and attends classes.  And sister owns she does not\r\nknow half so much as Cora!\'\r\n\r\nThis regular declaration of American independence confounded the two\r\nsisters, and made Averil recall the thoughts that had been wandering:\r\n\'No, Ella, in some things I have not learnt so much as Cora; but I\r\nbelieve I know enough to teach you, and it has been a comfort to me to\r\nkeep my two little sisters with me, and not send them to be mixed up\r\namong strange girls.  Besides, I have constantly hoped that our present\r\nway of life would soon be over, and that we should have a home of our\r\nown again.\'\r\n\r\n\'And why can\'t we!\' asked Ella, in a much more humble and subdued voice.\r\n\r\n\'Because Henry cannot hear of anything to do.  He thought he should\r\nsoon find an opening in this new country; but there seem to be so many\r\nmedical men everywhere that no one will employ or take into partnership\r\na man that nothing is known about; and he cannot produce any of his\r\ntestimonials, because they are all made out in his old name, except one\r\nletter that Dr. May gave him.  It is worse for Henry than for us, Ella,\r\nand all we can do for him is not to vex him with our grievances.\r\n\r\nPoor Averil! her dejected, patient voice, sad soft eyes, and gentle\r\npersuasive manner, were greatly changed from those of the handsome,\r\naccomplished girl, who had come home to be the family pride and pet;\r\nstill more, perhaps, from the wilful mistress of the house and the\r\nwayward sufferer of last summer.\r\n\r\n\'And shan\'t we go to live in the dear beautiful forest, as Cora Muller\r\nwishes?\'\r\n\r\nThere was a tap at the door, and the children\'s faces brightened,\r\nthough a shade passed over Averil\'s face, as if everything at that\r\nmoment were oppressive; but she recovered a smile of greeting for the\r\npretty creature who flew up to her with a fervent embrace--a girl a few\r\nyears her junior, with a fair, delicate face and figure, in a hot-house\r\nrose style of beauty.\r\n\r\n\'Father\'s come!\' she cried.\r\n\r\n\'How glad you must be!\'\r\n\r\n\'And now,\' whispered the children, \'we shall know about going to\r\nIndiana.\'\r\n\r\n\'He says Mordaunt is as tall as he is, and that the house is quite\r\nfixed for me; but I told him I must have one more term, and then I will\r\ntake you with me.  Ah! I am glad to see the children in white. If you\r\nwould only change that plain black silk, you would receive so much more\r\nconsideration.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t want it, Cora, thank you,\' said Averil, indifferently; and,\r\nindeed, the simple mourning she still wore was a contrast to her\r\nfriend\'s delicate, expensive silk.\r\n\r\n\'But I want it for you,\' pleaded Cora.  \'I don\'t want to hear my Averil\r\ncensured for English hauteur, and offend my country\'s feelings, so that\r\nshe keeps herself from seeing the best side.\'\r\n\r\n\'I see a very good, very dear side of one,\' said Averil, pressing the\r\neager hand that was held out to her, \'and that is enough for me.  I was\r\nnot a favourite in my own town, and I have not spirits to make friends\r\nhere.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah! you will have spirits in our woods,\' she said.  \'You shall show me\r\nhow you go gipsying in England.\'\r\n\r\n\'The dear, dear woods!  Oh, we must go!\' cried the little girls.\r\n\r\n\'But it is going to be a town,\' said Minna, gravely.\r\n\r\nCora laughed.  \'Ah, there will be plenty of bush this many a day,\r\nMinna!  No lack of butternuts and hickories, I promise you, nor of\r\nmaples to paint the woods gloriously.\'\r\n\r\n\'You have never been there?\' said Averil, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\'No; I have been boarding here these two years, since father and\r\nbrothers located there, but we had such a good time when we lived at my\r\ngrandfather\'s farm, in Ohio, while father was off on the railway\r\nbusiness.\'\r\n\r\nA gong resounded through the house, and Averil, suppressing a\r\ndisappointed sigh, allowed Cora to take possession of her arm, and,\r\nfollowed by the two children, became parts of a cataract of people who\r\ndescended the great staircase, and flowed into a saloon, where the\r\ndinner was prepared.\r\n\r\nHenry, with a tall, thin, wiry-looking gentleman, was entering at the\r\nsame time, and Averil found herself shaking hands with her brother\'s\r\ncompanion, and hearing him say, \'Good evening, Miss Warden; I\'m glad to\r\nmeet my daughter\'s friend.  I hope you feel at home in our great\r\ncountry.\'\r\n\r\nIt was so exactly the ordinary second-rate American style, that Averil,\r\nwho had expected something more in accordance with the refinement of\r\neverything about Cora, except a few of her tones, was a little\r\ndisappointed, and responded with difficulty; then, while Mr. Muller\r\ngreeted her sisters, she hastily laid her hand on Henry\'s arm, and\r\nsaid, under her breath, \'I\'ve a letter from him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hush!\' Henry looked about with a startled eye and repressing gesture.\r\nAveril drew back, and, one hand on her bosom, pressing the letter, and\r\nalmost holding down a sob, she took her accustomed seat at the meal.\r\nMinna, too languid for the rapidity of the movements, hardly made the\r\nexertion of tasting food.  Ella, alert and brisk, took care of herself\r\nas effectually as did Rosa Willis, on the opposite side of the table.\r\nAveril, all one throb of agitation, with the unread letter lying at her\r\nheart, directed all her efforts to look, eat, and drink, as usual;\r\nhappily, talking was the last thing that was needed.\r\n\r\nAveril had been greatly indebted to Miss Muller, who had taken pity on\r\nthe helpless strangers--interested, partly by her own romance about\r\nEngland, partly by their mourning dresses, dark melancholy eyes, and\r\nretiring, bewildered manner.  A beautiful motherless girl, under\r\nseventeen--left, to all intents and purposes, alone in New\r\nYork--attending a great educational establishment, far more independent\r\nand irresponsible than a young man at an English University, yet\r\nperfectly trustworthy--never subject to the bevues of the \'unprotected\r\nfemale,\' but self-reliant, modest, and graceful, in the heterogeneous\r\nsociety of the boarding-house--she was a constant marvel to Averil, and\r\na warm friendship soon sprang up.  The advances were, indeed, all on\r\none side; for Ave was too sad, and oppressed with too heavy a secret,\r\nto be readily accessible; but there was an attraction to the younger,\r\nfresher, freer nature, even in the mystery of her mournful reserve; and\r\nthe two drew nearer together from gratitude, and many congenial\r\nfeelings, that rendered Cora the one element of comfort in the\r\nboarding-house life; while Henry in vain sought for occupation.\r\n\r\nCora had been left under the charge of the lady of the boarding-house,\r\na distant connection, while her father, who had been engaged in more\r\nvarious professions than Averil could ever conceive of or remember, had\r\nbeen founding a new city in Indiana, at once as farmer and land-agent,\r\nand he had stolen a little time, in the dead season, to hurry up to New\r\nYork, partly on business, and partly to see his daughter, who had\r\ncommunicated to him her earnest desire that her new friends might be\r\ninduced to settle near their future abode.\r\n\r\nAmerican meals were too serious affairs for conversation; but such as\r\nthere was, was political, in all the fervid heat of the first\r\ncommencements of disunion and threatenings of civil war.  After the\r\nladies had repaired to their saloon, with its grand ottomans, sofas,\r\nrocking-chairs, and piano, the discussion continued among them; Cora\r\ntalking with the utmost eagerness of the tariff and of slavery, and the\r\nother topics of the day, intensely interesting, and of terrible moment,\r\nto her country; but that country Averil had not yet learnt to feel her\r\nown, and to her all was one dreary whirl of words, in which she longed\r\nto escape to her room, and read her letter.  Ella had joined Rosa\r\nWillis, and the other children; but Minna, as usual, kept under her\r\nsister\'s wing, and Averil could not bear to shake herself free of the\r\ngentle child.  The ladies of the boarding-house--some resident in order\r\nto avoid the arduous duties of housekeeping, others temporarily brought\r\nthither in an interregnum of servants, others spending a winter in the\r\ncity--had grown tired of asking questions that met with the scantiest\r\nresponse, took melancholy for disdain, and were all neglectful, some\r\nuncivil, to the grave, silent English girl, and she was sitting alone,\r\nwith Minna\'s hand in hers, as she had sat for many a weary evening,\r\nwhen her brother and Mr. Muller came up together, and, sitting down on\r\neither side of her, began to talk of the rising city of\r\nMassissauga--admirably situated--excellent water privilege,\r\ncommunicating with Lake Michigan--glorious primeval forest--healthy\r\nsituation--fertile land--where a colossal fortune might be realized in\r\nmaize, eighties, sections, speculations.  It was all addressed to her,\r\nand it was a hard task to give attention, so as to return a rational\r\nanswer, while her soul would fain have been clairvoyante, to read the\r\nletter in her breast.  She did perceive, at last, though not till long\r\nafter the children had gone to bed, that the project was, that the\r\nfamily should become the purchasers of shares, which would give them a\r\nright to a portion of the soil, excellent at present for growing corn,\r\nand certain hereafter to be multiplied in value for building; that\r\nHenry might, in the meantime, find an opening for practice, but might\r\nspeedily be independent of it.  It sounded promising, and it was\r\nescape--escape from forced inaction, from an uncongenial life, from\r\ninjury to the children, and it would be with Cora, her one friend.\r\nWhat was the demur, and why were they consulting her, who, as Henry\r\nknew, was ready to follow him wherever he chose to carry her?  At last\r\ncame a gleam of understanding: \'Then, Doctor, you will talk it over\r\nwith your sister, and give me your ultimatum;\' and therewith Mr. Muller\r\nwalked away to mingle in other conversation, and Henry coming closer to\r\nhis sister, she again eagerly said, \'I have it here; you shall see it\r\nto-morrow, when I have read it.\'\r\n\r\n\'It--\'\r\n\r\n\'The letter.\'\r\n\r\n\'How can you be so unguarded?  You have not let the children know? Take\r\ncare then, I will not have the subject revived with them.\'\r\n\r\n\'But Minna--\'\r\n\r\n\'It is this heated stove atmosphere.  She will soon forget if you don\'t\r\nkeep it up, and she will be herself when we leave this place, and it\r\ndepends on you when we do that, Ave.\'\r\n\r\n\'On me!\' she said, with bewildered face.\r\n\r\nAnd Henry, marvelling at her slowness of comprehension, made her\r\nunderstand that the advance of money, for the purchase at Massissauga,\r\nmust come from her means.  His own had been heavily drained by the\r\nremoval, the long period of inaction, and moreover what remained had\r\nbeen embarked in shares in a company, absolutely certain to succeed,\r\nbut where they were not at once available for sale.  Averil was now of\r\nage, her property was in her own power, and could not, her brother\r\nassured her, be better invested, than on ground certain to increase in\r\nvalue.  She looked at him, confused and distressed, aware that it was\r\ntoo important a step to be taken without consideration, yet unable to\r\ncompose her thoughts, or recollect objections.\r\n\r\n\'Must I answer to-night?\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'No, there is no need for that.  But we must close to-morrow with\r\nMuller, for it is not a chance that will long go begging.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then let me go, please, Henry,\' she said, imploringly.  \'I will tell\r\nyou to-morrow, but I can\'t now.  I don\'t seem to understand anything.\'\r\n\r\nIt was late, and he released her, with a kind good night, though still\r\nwith a sign of caution.  Cora, however, hastened to join her, and walk\r\nup the stairs with her, eagerly inquiring into the success of the\r\nnegotiation, and detailing what she had gathered from her father as to\r\nthe improvements he had been making.  She would fain have made Averil\r\ncome into her bedroom to build castles there; but this was more than\r\ncould be borne, and breaking from her at last, Averil reached her own\r\nroom, not to think of Mr. Muller\'s project, but to cast an anxious\r\nglance at each of the little beds, to judge whether the moment had come\r\nwhen that famishing hunger might be appeased by the crumb which for\r\nthese mortal hours had lain upon her craving heart--the very first\r\nsince the one on the arrival at Milbank.\r\n\r\nEach brown head was shrouded in the coverings, the long dark fringes\r\nrested safely on the cheeks, and Averil at length drew out the\r\ntreasure, and laid it on her hand to dwell on its very sight.  The\r\naddress needed to be looked at with lingering earnestness, as if it had\r\nindeed been a missive from another world; she looked, and was tardy to\r\nunfold it, as though, now the moment was come, the sense of being in\r\ncommunication with her brother must be tasted to the utmost, ere\r\nentering on the utterances that must give pain; and when she did open\r\nthe envelope, perhaps the first sensation was disappointment--the lines\r\nwere not near enough together, the writing not small enough, to satisfy\r\neven the first glance of the yearning eye.  It was cheerful, it spoke\r\nof good health, and full occupation, with the use of books, daily\r\nexercise, the chaplain\'s visits, schooling and attendance at chapel,\r\nand of the great pleasure of having heard from her.  \'And that good Dr.\r\nMay inclosed your letter in one written to me with his own hand, a\r\nkindness I never dared to think of as possible, but which he promises\r\nto repeat.  Your letter and his are the continual food of my thoughts,\r\nand are valued beyond all power of words.  I only hope you knew that I\r\nhave not been allowed to write sooner, and have not expected letters.\'\r\nThen came a few brief comments on her last inquiries, and entreaties\r\nthat she would give him full information of all details of their\r\npresent life: \'It will carry me along with you, and I shall live with\r\nyou, both as I read, and as I dwell on it afterwards.  Do not indulge\r\nin a moment\'s uneasiness about me, for I am well, and busy; every one\r\nis as kind to me as duty permits, and Dr. May is always ready to do all\r\nin his power for me.\'  There were a few affectionate words for Henry,\r\nand \'I long to send a message to the children, but I know it is better\r\nfor them to let me drop from their minds, only you must tell me all\r\nabout them; I want to know that the dear little Minna is bright and\r\nhappy again.\'\r\n\r\nNo confidences, only generalities; not even any reference to the one\r\nunbroken bond of union, the one support, except in the three scanty\r\nfinal words, the simplest of blessings.  It was not satisfying; but\r\nAveril recalled, with a start, that no wonder the letter was meagre,\r\nsince it was necessarily subject to inspection; and how could the inner\r\nsoul be expressed when all must pass under strangers\' eyes, who would\r\nthink such feelings plausible hypocrisy in a convicted felon. Again she\r\ntook it up, to suck to the utmost all that might be conveyed in the\r\nshort commonplace sentences, and to gaze at them as if intensity of\r\nstudy could reveal whether the cheerfulness were real or only assumed.\r\nBe they what they might, the words had only three weeks back been\r\nformed by Leonard\'s hand, and she pressed her lips upon them in a\r\nfervent agony of affection.\r\n\r\nWhen she roused herself and turned her head, she perceived on Minna\'s\r\npillow two eyes above the bed-clothes, intently fixed on her.  Should\r\nshe see, or should she not see?  She believed that the loving heart was\r\nsuffering a cruel wrong, she yearned to share all with the child, but\r\nshe was chained by the command of one brother, and by that acquiescence\r\nof the other which to her was more than a command.  She would not see,\r\nshe turned away, and made her preparations for the night without\r\nbetraying that she knew that the little one was awake, resuming the\r\ntedious guard on the expression of her face.  But when her long\r\nkneeling had ended, and with it that which was scarcely so much\r\nconscious intercession as the resting an intolerable load on One who\r\nalone knew its weight, just as she darkened the room for the night, the\r\nlow voice whispered, \'Ave, is it?\'--\r\n\r\nAnd Averil crept up to the little bed: \'Yes, Minna; he is well!  He\r\nhopes you are bright and happy, but he says it is best you should\r\nforget him.\'  The brow was cold and clammy, the little frame chill and\r\ntrembling, the arms clasped her neck convulsively.  She lifted the\r\nchild into her own bed, pressed tight to her own bosom, and though no\r\nother word passed between the sisters, that contact seemed to soothe\r\naway the worst bitterness; and Averil slept from the stillness enforced\r\non her by the heed of not disturbing Minna\'s sleep.\r\n\r\nLittle that night had she recked of the plan needing so much\r\ndeliberation!  When she awoke it was to the consciousness that besides\r\nthe arrival of Leonard\'s letter, something had happened--there was some\r\nperplexity--what was it?  And when it came back she was bewildered.\r\nHer own fortune had always appeared to her something to fall back on in\r\ncase of want of success, and to expend it thus was binding the whole\r\nfamily down at a perilous moment, to judge by the rumours of battle and\r\nresistance.  And all she had ever heard at home, much that she daily\r\nheard at New York, inclined her to distrust and dislike of American\r\nspeculations.  It was Cora\'s father!  Her heart smote her for including\r\nhim in English prejudice, when Henry liked and trusted him!  And she\r\nhad disobeyed and struggled against Henry too long.  She had promised\r\nto be submissive and yielding.  But was this the time?  And the\r\nboarding-house life--proverbially the worst for children--was fast\r\nAmericanizing Ella, while Minna drooped like a snowdrop in a hot-house,\r\nand idleness might be mischievous to Henry.\r\n\r\nOh, for some one to consult! for some one to tell her whether the risk\r\nwas a foolish venture, or if the terms were safe!  But not a creature\r\ndid she know well enough to seek advice from!  Even the clergyman,\r\nwhose church she attended, was personally unknown to her; Cora Muller\r\nwas her sole intimate; there was a mutual repulsion between her and the\r\nother ladies, and still more with the gentlemen. A boarding-house was\r\nnot the scene in which to find such as would inspire confidence, and\r\nthey had no introductions.  There was no one to turn to; and in the\r\ndreary indifference that had grown over her, she did not even feel\r\ncapable of exerting her own judgment to the utmost, even if she had\r\nbeen able to gather certain facts, or to know prudent caution from\r\nblind prejudice--often woman\'s grievous difficulty.  What could a\r\nhelpless girl of one-and-twenty, in a land of strangers, do, but try to\r\nthink that by laying aside the use of her own judgment she was trusting\r\nall to Providence, and that by leaving all to her brother she was\r\nproving her repentance for her former conduct.\r\n\r\nThere, too, were her sisters, clamorous with hopes of the forest life;\r\nand there was Cora, urging the scheme with all the fervour of girlish\r\nfriendship, and in herself no small element in its favour, engaging for\r\neverything, adducing precedents for every kind of comfort and success,\r\nand making Ave\'s consent a test of her love. One question Averil asked\r\nof her--whether they should be utterly out of reach of their Church?\r\nCora herself had been bred up to liberal religious ways, and was ready\r\nto attend whatever denomination of public worship came first to hand,\r\nthough that which had descended from the Pilgrim Fathers came most\r\nnaturally.  She had been at various Sunday schools, and was a good\r\nconscientious girl, but had never gone through the process of\r\nconversion, so that Rosa Willis had horrified Ella by pronouncing her\r\n\'not a Christian.\'  She had no objection to show her English friends\r\nthe way to the favourite Episcopal Church, especially as it was\r\nesteemed fashionable; and her passion for Averil had retained her\r\nthere, with growing interest, drawn on by Averil\'s greater precision of\r\nreligious knowledge, and the beauty of the Church system, displayed to\r\nher as the one joy and relief left to one evidently crushed with\r\nsuffering.  The use of Averil\'s books, conversations with her, and the\r\nteaching she heard, disposed her more and more to profess herself a\r\nmember of the Episcopal Church, and she was unable to enter into\r\nAveril\'s scruples at leading her to so decided a step without her\r\nfather\'s sanction. \'Father would be satisfied whatever profession she\r\nmade.  Did people in England try to force their children\'s\r\nconsciences?\'  Cora, at Averil\'s desire, ascertained that Massissauga\r\nhad as yet no place of worship of its own; but there was a choice of\r\nchapels within a circuit of five miles, and an Episcopal Church seven\r\nmiles off, at the chief town of the county.  Moreover, her father\r\ndeclared that the city of Massissauga would soon be considerable enough\r\nto invite every variety of minister to please every denomination of\r\ninhabitant. Averil felt that the seven miles off church was all she\r\ncould reasonably hope for, and her mind was clear on that score, when\r\nHenry came to take her out walking for the sake of being able to talk\r\nmore freely.\r\n\r\nNo longer afraid of being overheard, he gave kind attention to\r\nLeonard\'s letter; and though he turned away from the subject sooner\r\nthan she wished, she was not exacting.  Again he laid before her the\r\nadvantages of their migration, and assured her that if there were the\r\nslightest risk he would be the last to make the proposal.  She asked if\r\nit were safe to invest money in a country apparently on the eve of\r\ncivil war?\r\n\r\nHe laughed the idea to scorn.  How could the rebel states make war,\r\nwith a population of negroes sure to rise against their masters? Where\r\nshould their forces come from?  Faction would soon be put down, and the\r\nunion be stronger than ever.  It was what Averil had been hearing\r\nmorning, noon, and night, so no wonder she believed it, and was ashamed\r\nof a futile girlish fear.\r\n\r\nAnd was Henry sure it was a healthy place?  Had she not heard of\r\nfeverish swamps in Indiana?\r\n\r\nOh yes, in new unsettled places; but there had hardly been an ailment\r\nin the Muller family since they had settled at Massissauga.\r\n\r\nAnd Averil\'s last murmur was--Could he find out anything about other\r\npeople\'s opinion of the speculation? did they know enough about Mr.\r\nMuller to trust themselves entirely in his hands?\r\n\r\nHenry was almost angry--Could not his sister trust him to take all\r\nreasonable precaution?  It was the old story of prejudice against\r\nwhatever he took up.\r\n\r\nPoor Averil was disarmed directly.  The combats of will and their\r\nconsequences rose up before her, and with them Leonard\'s charges to\r\ndevote herself to Henry.  She could but avow herself willing to do\r\nwhatever he pleased.  She only hoped he would be careful.\r\n\r\nAll thenceforth was pleasant anticipation and hope.  Averil\'s property\r\nhad to be transferred to America, and invested in shares of the land at\r\nMassissauga; but this was to cause no delay in arranging for the\r\nremoval, they were only to wait until the winter had broken up, and the\r\nroads become passable after the melting of the snows; and meantime Mr.\r\nMuller was to have their house prepared.  Cora would remain and\r\naccompany them, and in the intervening time promised to assist Averil\r\nwith her judgment in making the necessary purchases for \'stepping\r\nwestward.\'\r\n\r\nWhen Averil wrote their plans to her English friends, she felt the\r\ndifficulty of pleading for them.  She was sensible that at Stoneborough\r\nthe risking of her property would be regarded as folly on her part, and\r\nsomething worse on that of her brother; and she therefore wrote with\r\nevery effort to make the whole appear her own voluntary act--though the\r\nvery effort made her doubly conscious that the sole cause for her\r\npassive acquiescence was, that her past self-will in trifles had left\r\nher no power to contend for her own opinion in greater matters--the\r\ncommon retribution on an opinionative woman of principle.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it was always with an effort that she wrote to Mary May.  A\r\nrejected offer from a brother is a rock in a correspondence with a\r\nsister, and Averil had begun to feel greatly ashamed of the manner of\r\nher own response.  Acceptance would have been impossible; but\r\nirritating as had been Tom May\'s behaviour, insulting as had been his\r\nexplanation, and provoking, his pertinacity, she had begun to feel that\r\nthe impulse had been too generous and disinterested to deserve such\r\ntreatment, and that bitterness and ill-temper had made her lose all\r\nsoftness and dignity, so that he must think that his pitying affection\r\nhad been bestowed on an ungrateful vixen, and be as much disgusted with\r\nthe interview as she was herself.  She did not wish him to love her;\r\nbut she regretted the form of the antidote, above all, since he was of\r\nthe few who appreciated Leonard; and the more she heard of Ella\'s\r\nnarrations of his kindness, the more ashamed she grew.  Every letter to\r\nor from Mary renewed the uncomfortable sense, and she would have\r\ndropped the correspondence had it not been her sole medium of\r\ncommunication with her imprisoned brother, since Henry would not permit\r\nletters to be posted with the Milbank address.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n  A little hint to solace woe,\r\n  A hint, a whisper breathing low,\r\n  \'I may not speak of what I know.\'--TENNYSON\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the pace at which rapid people walk alone, when they wish to devour\r\nboth the way and their own sensations, Ethel May was mounting the hill\r\nout of the town in the premature heat assumed by May in compliment to\r\nWhitsun week, when a prolonged shout made her turn.  At first she\r\nthought it was her father, but her glass showed her that it was the\r\nbrother so like him in figure that the London-made coat, and the hair\r\npartaking of the sand instead of the salt, were often said to be the\r\nchief distinction.  Moreover, the dainty steps over the puddles were\r\nlittle like the strides of the Doctor, and left no doubt that it was\r\nthe one wedding guest who had been despaired of.\r\n\r\n\'O, Tom, I am glad you are come!\'\r\n\r\n\'What a rate you were running away at!  I thought you had done with\r\nyour hurricane pace.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hurricane because of desperate hurry.  I\'m afraid I can\'t turn back\r\nwith you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Where is all the world?\'\r\n\r\n\'Blanche is helping Mary arrange the Hoxton--I mean her own\r\ndrawing-room.  Hector has brought a dog-cart to drive papa about in;\r\nDaisy is gone with Harry and Aubrey to the Grange for some camellias.\'\r\n\r\n\'And Ethel rushing to Cocksmoor!\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t help it, Tom,\' she said, humbly; \'I wish I could.\'\r\n\r\n\'What\'s this immense pannier you are carrying?\'\r\n\r\n\'It is quite light.  It is twelve of the hats for the children\r\ntomorrow.  Mary was bent on trimming them all as usual, and I was\r\ndeluded enough to believe she would, till last evening I found just one\r\nand a half done!  I did as many as I could at night, till papa heard me\r\nrustling about and thumped.  Those went early this morning; and these\r\nare the rest, which I have just finished.\'\r\n\r\n\'Was there no one to send?\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear Tom, is your experience of weddings so slight as to suppose\r\nthere is an available being in the family the day before?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure I don\'t desire such experience.  Why could not they be\r\ncontent without ferreting me down?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am very glad you have come.  It would have been a great\r\nmortification if you had stayed away.  I never quite believed you\r\nwould.\'\r\n\r\n\'I had much rather see the operation I shall miss to-morrow morning. I\r\nshall go back by the two o\'clock train.\'\r\n\r\n\'To study their happiness all the way up to town?\'\r\n\r\n\'Then by the mail--\'\r\n\r\n\'I won\'t torment you to stay; but I think papa will want a talk with\r\nyou.\'\r\n\r\n\'The very thing I don\'t want.  Why can\'t he dispose of his property\r\nlike other people, and give Richard his rights?\'\r\n\r\n\'You know Richard would only be encumbered.\'\r\n\r\n\'No such thing; Richard is a reasonable being--he will marry some of\r\nthese days--get the living after Wilmot, and--\'\r\n\r\n\'But you know how papa would be grieved to separate the practice from\r\nthe house.\'\r\n\r\n\'Because he and his fathers were content to bury themselves in a hole,\r\nhe expects me to do the same.  Why, what should I do?  The place is\r\nover-doctored already.  Every third person is a pet patient sending for\r\nhim for a gnat-bite, gratis, taking the bread out of Wright\'s mouth.\r\nNo wonder Henry Ward kicked!  If I came here, I must practise on the\r\nlap-dogs!  Here\'s my father, stronger than any of us, with fifteen good\r\nyears\' work in him at the least!  He would be wretched at giving up to\r\nme a tenth part of his lambs, and that tenth would keep us always in\r\nhot water.  His old-world practice would not go down with me, and he\r\nwould think everything murder that was fresher than the year 1830.\'\r\n\r\n\'I thought he was remarkable for having gone on with the world,\' said\r\nEthel, repressing some indignation.\r\n\r\n\'So he has in a way, but always against the grain.  He has a tough lot\r\nof prejudices; and you may depend upon it, they would be more obstinate\r\nagainst me than any one else, and I should be looked on as an undutiful\r\ndog for questioning them, besides getting the whole credit of every\r\ncase that went wrong.\'\r\n\r\n\'I think you are unjust,\' said Ethel, flushing with displeasure.\r\n\r\n\'I wish I were not, Ethel; but when there is one son in a family who\r\ncan do nothing that is not taken amiss, it is hard that he should be\r\nthe one picked out to be pinned down, and, maybe, goaded into doing\r\nsomething to be really sorry for.\'\r\n\r\nThere was truth enough in this to seal Ethel\'s lips from replying that\r\nit was Tom\'s own fault, since his whole nature and constitution were\r\nfar more the cause than his conduct, and she answered, \'You might get\r\nsome appointment for the present, till he really wants you.\'\r\n\r\n\'To be ordered home just as I am making something of it, and see as\r\nmany cases in ten years as I could in a month in town.  Things are\r\naltered since his time, if he could only see it.  What was the use of\r\ngiving me a first-rate education, if he meant to stick me down here?\'\r\n\r\n\'At least I hope you will think long before you inflict the cruel\r\ndisappointment of knowing that not one of his five sons will succeed to\r\nthe old practice.\'\r\n\r\n\'The throne, you mean, Ethel.  Pish!\'\r\n\r\nThe \'Pish\' was as injurious to her hereditary love for \'the old\r\npractice,\' and for the old town, as to her reverence for her father.\r\nOne angry \'Tom!\' burst from her lips, and only the experience that\r\nscolding made him worse, restrained her from desiring him to turn back\r\nif this was the best he had to say.  Indeed she wondered to find him\r\nstill by her side, holding the gate of the plantation open for her.  He\r\npeered under her hat as she went through--\r\n\r\n\'How hot you look!\' he said, laying hold of the handles of the basket.\r\n\r\n\'Thank you; but it is more cumbrous than heavy,\' she said, not letting\r\ngo; \'it is not _that_--\'\r\n\r\nAn elision which answered better than words, to show that his speech,\r\nrather than hill or load, had made her cheeks flame; but he only drew\r\nthe great basket more decisively from her hand, put his stick into the\r\nhandle, and threw it over his shoulder; and no doubt it was a much\r\ngreater act of good-nature from him than it would have been from\r\nRichard or Harry.\r\n\r\n\'This path always reminds me of this very matter,\' he said; \'I talked\r\nit over with Meta here, on the way to lay the foundation-stone at\r\nCocksmoor, till Norman overtook us and monopolized her for good, poor\r\nlittle thing.  She was all in the high romantic strain, making a sort\r\nof knight hospitaller of my father.  I wonder what she is like by this\r\ntime, and how much of _that_ she has left.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of the high romantic strain?  I should think it was as much as ever\r\nthe salt of life to her.  Her last letter described her contrivances to\r\nmake a knapsack for Norman on his visitation tour.  Oh, fancy old June\r\na venerable archdeacon!\'\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t think a colonial archdeacon is like one of your great portly\r\nswells in a shovel hat.\'\r\n\r\n\'It must be something remarkable that made Norman portly.  But as for\r\nthe shovel hat, Mrs. Meta has insisted on having it sent out.  I was\r\ngoing to tell you that she says, "I do like such a good tough bit of\r\nstitchery, to fit my knight out for the cause."\'\r\n\r\n\'Marriage and distance have not frozen up her effusions.\'\r\n\r\n\'No; when people carry souls in their pens, they are worth a great deal\r\nmore, if they are to go to a distance.\'\r\n\r\nAh! by the bye, I suppose Cheviot has put a fresh lock on Mary\'s\r\nwriting-case.\'\r\n\r\n\'I suspect some of Mary\'s correspondence will devolve on me.  Harry has\r\nasked me already.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wished you had mentioned more about the letters of late.  Leonard\r\nwanted to know more than I could tell him.\'\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t mean that you have seen him?  O, Tom, how kind of you! Papa\r\nhas been trying hard to get a day now that these first six months are\r\nup; but there are two or three cases that wanted so much watching that\r\nhe has not been able to stir.\'\r\n\r\n\'I know how he lets himself be made a prisoner, and that it was a\r\nchance whether any one saw the poor fellow at all.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am so glad\'--and Ethel turned on him a face still flushed, but now\r\nwith gratitude.  \'How was he looking?\'\r\n\r\n\'The costume is not becoming, and he has lost colour and grown\r\nhollow-eyed; but I saw no reason for being uneasy about him; he looked\r\nclear and in health, and has not got to slouch yet.  It is shocking to\r\nsee such a grand face and head behind a grating.\'\r\n\r\n\'Could he talk\'?\r\n\r\n\'Why, the presence of a warder is against conversation, and six months\r\nof shoe-making in a cell does not give much range of ideas. There was\r\nnothing to be done but to talk on right ahead and judge by his eyes if\r\nhe liked it.\'\r\n\r\n\'I suppose you could find out nothing about himself?\'\r\n\r\n\'He said he got on very well; but one does not know that means.  I\r\nasked if he got books; and he said there was a very good library, and\r\nhe could get what gave him something to think of; and he says they give\r\ninteresting lectures in school.\'\r\n\r\n\'You could not gather what is thought of him?\'\r\n\r\n\'No; I saw but a couple of officers of the place, and could only get\r\nout of them "good health and good conduct."  I do not expect even his\r\nconduct makes much impression as to his innocence, for I saw it stated\r\nthe other day that the worst prisoners are those that are always\r\ngetting convicted for petty offences; those that have committed one\r\ngreat crime are not so depraved, and are much more amenable.  However,\r\nhe has only three months more at Pentonville, and then he will go to\r\nPortland, Chatham, or Gibraltar.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I hope it will not be Gibraltar!  But at least that terrible\r\nsolitude will be over.\'\r\n\r\n\'At any rate, his spirit is not broken.  I could see his eye light up\r\nafter I had talked a little while, and he fell into his natural tone\r\nagain.  He would not try to put out his hand to me when he came down;\r\nbut when I went away, he put it through and we had a good hearty shake.\r\nSomehow it made one feel quite small.\'\r\n\r\nEthel could have pledged herself for the soundness of Tom\'s nature\r\nafter those words; but all she did was in an unwonted tone to utter the\r\nunwonted exclamation--\'Dear Tom.\'\r\n\r\n\'If my father does not come up, I shall see him once more before he\r\nleaves Pentonville,\' added Tom; \'and so you must mind and let me know\r\nall about his people in America.  I found he had no notion of the row\r\nthat is beginning there, so I said not a word of it.  But what is all\r\nthis about going to Indiana?\'\r\n\r\n\'They are going at the end of April to settle in a place called\r\nMassissauga, where Henry is to farm till practice comes to him.  It is\r\ntowards the north of the State, in the county of Pulaski.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ay, in one of the pestilential swamps that run up out of Lake\r\nMichigan.  All the fertile ground there breeds as many fevers and agues\r\nas it does stalks of corn.\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed! how did you hear that?\'\r\n\r\n\'I looked up the place after Leonard told me of it.  It is as unlucky a\r\nlocation as the ill luck of that fellow Henry could have pitched on.\r\nSome friend Leonard spoke of--a Yankee, I suppose, meaning to make a\r\nprey of them.\'\r\n\r\n\'The father of their young lady friend at the boarding-house.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! a Yankee edition of Mrs. Pugh!\'\r\n\r\n\'And the worst of it is that this is to be done with poor Averil\'s\r\nfortune.  She has written to Mr. Bramshaw to sell out for her, and send\r\nher the amount, and he is terribly vexed; but she is of age, and there\r\nare no trustees nor any one to stop it.\'\r\n\r\n\'All of a piece,\' muttered Tom; then presently he swung the basket\r\nround on the ground with a vehement exclamation--\'If any man on this\r\nearth deserved to be among the robbers and murderers, I know who it\r\nis.\'  Then he shouldered his load again, and walked on in silence by\r\nhis sister\'s side to the school door.\r\n\r\nRichard had been obliged to go to a benefit club entertainment; and\r\nEthel, knowing the limited literary resources of the parsonage, was\r\nsurprised to find Tom still waiting for her, when the distribution and\r\nfitting of the blue-ribboned hats was over, and matters arranged for\r\nthe march of the children to see the wedding, and to dine afterwards at\r\nthe Grammar-school hall.\r\n\r\n\'O, Tom, I did not expect to find you here.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is not fit for you to be walking about alone on a Whit Monday.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am very glad to have you, but I am past that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t talk nonsense; girls are girls till long past your age,\' said\r\nTom.\r\n\r\n\'It is not so much age, as living past things,\' said Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'It was not only that, added Tom; \'but I\'ve more to say to you, while\r\none can be sure of a quiet moment.  Have you heard anything about that\r\nplace?\' and he pointed in the direction of the Vintry Mill.\r\n\r\n\'I heard something of an intention to part with it, and have been\r\nwatching for an advertisement; but I can see none in the Courant, or on\r\nthe walls.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mind he does not slip off unawares.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know what to do now that old Hardy is cut off from us.  I\r\ntried to stir up Dr. Spencer to go and investigate, but I could not\r\ntell him why, and he has not the same interest in going questing about\r\nas he used to have.  People never will do the one thing one wants\r\nparticularly!\'\r\n\r\nTom\'s look and gesture made her ask if he knew of anything wrong with\r\ntheir old friend; and in return, she was told that Dr. Spencer\'s recent\r\nvisit to London had been to consult Sir Matthew Fleet.  The foundations\r\nof mortal disease had been laid in India, and though it might long\r\nremain in abeyance, there were from time to time symptoms of activity;\r\nand tedious lingering infirmity was likely to commence long before the\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\'And what do you think the strange old fellow charged me as we walked\r\naway from dining at Fleet\'s?\'\r\n\r\n\'Secrecy, of course,\' returned the much-shocked Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'One does keep a secret by telling you.  It was to have my eye on some\r\nlodging with a decent landlady, where, when it is coming to that, he\r\ncan go up to be alone, out of the way of troubling Dick, and of all of\r\nyou.\'\r\n\r\n\'Tom, how dreadful!\'\r\n\r\n\'I fancy it is something of the animal instinct of creeping away alone,\r\nand partly his law to himself not to trouble Dick.\'\r\n\r\n\'An odd idea of what would trouble Dick!\'\r\n\r\n\'So I told him; but he said, after seeing what it cost my father to\r\nwatch dear Margaret\'s long decay, he would never entail the like on\r\nhim.  It is queer, and it is beautiful, the tender way he has about my\r\nfather, treating him like a pet to be shielded and guarded--a man that\r\nhas five times the force and vigour of body and mind that he has now,\r\nwhatever they may have been.\'\r\n\r\n\'Very beautiful, and I cannot help telling you how beautiful,\' said\r\nEthel, greatly moved; \'only remember, it is not to be mentioned.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ha! did he ever make you an offer?  I have sometimes suspected it.\'\r\n\r\n\'No indeed!  It was much--much more beautiful than that!\'\r\n\r\n\'Our mother then?  I had thought of that too, and it accounts for his\r\nhaving always taken to you the most of us.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, I\'m the least like her of us all!\'\r\n\r\n\'So they say, I know, and I can\'t recollect enough to judge, except\r\nthat\'--and Tom\'s voice was less clear for a moment--\'there was\r\nsomething in being with her that I\'ve never found again, except now and\r\nthen with you, Ethel.  Well, he never got over it, I suppose.\'\r\n\r\nAnd Ethel briefly told of the rash resolution, the unsettled life, the\r\nneglect of the father\'s wishes, the grievous remorse, the broken\r\nhealth, and restless aimless wanderings, ending at last in loving\r\ntendance of the bereaved rival.  It had been a life never wanting in\r\ngenerosity or benevolence, yet falling far short of what it might have\r\nbeen--a gallant voyage made by a wreck--and yet the injury had been\r\nless from the disappointment than from the manner of bearing it.\r\nSuddenly it struck her that Tom might suspect her of intending a\r\npersonal application of the history, and she faltered; but he kept her\r\nto it by his warm interest and many questions.\r\n\r\n\'And oh, Tom, he must not be allowed to go away in this manner! Nothing\r\nwould so cut papa to the heart!\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t believe he ever will, Ethel.  He may go on for years as he is;\r\nand he said in the midst that he meant to live to carry out the\r\ndrainage.  Besides, if it comes gradually on him, he may feel dependent\r\nand lose the energy to move.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! what a sorrow for papa!  But I know that not to watch over him\r\nwould make it all the worse.\'\r\n\r\nThey walked on gravely till, on the top of the hill, Tom exclaimed,\r\n\'They\'ve mounted the flag on the Minster steeple already.\'\r\n\r\n\'It went up yesterday for Harvey Anderson and Mrs. Pugh.  There was a\r\nproposal to join forces, and have a double wedding--so interesting, the\r\ntwo school-fellows and two young friends.  The Cheviot girls much\r\nregretted it was not to be.\'\r\n\r\n\'Cheviot girls!  Heavens and earth!  At home?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not sleeping; but we shall have them all day to-morrow, for they\r\ncannot get home the same day by setting off after the wedding.  There\r\nwill be no one else, for even our own people are going, for Harry is to\r\ngo to Maplewood with Blanche, and Aubrey has to be at Woolwich; but we\r\nshall all be at home to-night.\'\r\n\r\n\'Last time was in the volunteer days, two or three centuries ago.\'\r\n\r\nIt was strange how, with this naturally least congenial of all the\r\nfamily, Ethel had a certain understanding and fellow-feeling that gave\r\nher a sense of rest and relief in his company, only impaired by the\r\ndread of rubs between him and his father.  None, however, happened; Dr.\r\nMay had been too much hurt to press the question of the inheritance,\r\nand took little notice of Tom, being much occupied with the final\r\nbusiness about the wedding, and engrossed by Hector and Harry, who\r\nalways absorbed him in their short intervals of his company.  Tom went\r\nto see Dr. Spencer, and brought him in, so cheerful and full of life,\r\nthat what Ethel had been hearing seemed like a dream, excepting when\r\nshe recognized Tom\'s unobtrusive gentleness and attention towards him.\r\n\r\nShe was surprised and touched through all the harass and hurry of that\r\nevening and morning, to find the \'must be dones\' that had of late\r\ndevolved on her alone, now lightened and aided by Tom, who appeared to\r\nhave come for the sole purpose of being always ready to give a helping\r\nhand where she wanted it, with all Richard\'s manual dexterity, and more\r\nresource and quickness.  The refreshment of spirits was the more\r\nvaluable as this was a very unexciting wedding. Even Gertrude, not yet\r\nfourteen, had been surfeited with weddings, and replied to Harry\'s old\r\nwit of \'three times a bridesmaid and never a bride,\' that she hoped so,\r\nher experience of married life was extremely flat; and a glance at\r\nBlanche\'s monotonous dignity, and Flora\'s worn face, showed what that\r\nexperience was.\r\n\r\nHarry was the only one to whom there was the freshness of novelty, and\r\nhe was the great element of animation; but as the time came near,\r\nhonest Harry had been seized with a mortal dread of the tears he\r\nimagined an indispensable adjunct of the ceremony, and went about\r\nprivately consulting every one how much weeping was inevitable. Flora\r\ntold him she saw no reason for any tears, and Ethel that when people\r\nfelt very much they couldn\'t cry; but on the other hand, Blanche said\r\nshe felt extremely nervous, and knew she should be overcome; Gertrude\r\nassured him that on all former occasions Mary did all the crying\r\nherself; and Aubrey told him that each bridesmaid carried six\r\nhandkerchiefs, half for herself and half for the bride.\r\n\r\nThe result was, that the last speech made by Harry to his favourite\r\nsister in her maiden days was thus:--\'Well, Mary, you do look\r\nuncommonly nice and pretty; but now\'--most persuasively--\'you\'ll be a\r\ngood girl and not cry, will you?\' and as Mary fluttered, tried to\r\nsmile, and looked out through very moist eyes, he continued, \'I feel\r\nhorribly soft-hearted to-day, and if you howl I must, you know; so\r\nmind, if I see you beginning, I shall come out with my father\'s old\r\nstory of the spirit of the flood and the spirit of the fell, and that\r\nwill stop it, if anything can.\'\r\n\r\nThe comicality of Harry\'s alarm was nearly enough to \'stop it,\' coupled\r\nwith the great desire of Daisy that he should be betrayed into tears;\r\nand Mary did behave extremely well, and looked all that a bride should\r\nlook.  Admirable daughter and sister, she would be still more in her\r\nplace as wife; hers was the truly feminine nature that, happily for\r\nmankind, is the most commonplace, and that she was a thoroughly generic\r\nbride is perhaps a testimony to her perfection in the part, as in all\r\nothers where quiet unselfish womanhood was the essential.  Never had\r\nshe been so sweet in every tone, word, and caress; never had Ethel so\r\nfully felt how much she loved her, or how entirely they had been one,\r\nfrom a time almost too far back for memory.  There had not been\r\nintellectual equality; but perhaps it was better, fuller affection,\r\nthan if there had been; for Mary had filled up a part that had been in\r\nsome measure wanting in Ethel.  She had been a sort of wife to her\r\nsister, and thus was the better prepared for her new life, but was all\r\nthe sorer loss at home.\r\n\r\nThe bridegroom!  How many times had Ethel to remind herself of her\r\nesteem, and security of Mary\'s happiness, besides frowning down\r\nGertrude\'s saucy comments, and trying to laugh away Tom\'s low growl\r\nthat good things always fell to the share of poor hearts and narrow\r\nminds.  Mr. Cheviot did in fact cut a worse figure than George Rivers\r\nof old, having a great fund of natural bashfulness and\r\nself-consciousness, which did not much damage his dignity, but made his\r\nattempts at gaiety and ease extremely awkward, not to say sheepish.\r\nPerhaps the most trying moment was the last, when hearing a few words\r\nbetween Ethel and Mary about posting a mere scrap, if only an empty\r\nenvelope, from the first resting-place, he turned round, with his\r\nlaugh, to object to rash promises, and remind his dear sister Ethel\r\nthat post-offices were not always near at hand!  After that, when Mary\r\nin her bright tenderness hung round her sister, it was as if that was\r\nthe last fond grasp from the substance--as if only the shadow would\r\ncome back and live in Minster Street.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was because Ethel had tried to rule it otherwise, Mr.\r\nCheviot had insisted that the Cocksmoor children\'s share in the\r\nfestivity should be a dinner in the Whichcote hall, early in the day,\r\nafter which they had to be sent home, since no one chose to have the\r\nresponsibility of turning them loose to play in the Grammar-school\r\nprecincts, even in the absence of the boys.  Richard was much afraid of\r\ntheir getting into mischief, and was off immediately after church to\r\nsuperintend the dinner, and marshal them home; and the rest of the\r\nworld lost the resource that entertaining them generally afforded the\r\nsurvivors after a marriage, and which was specially needed with the two\r\nCheviot sisters to be disposed of.  By the time the Riverses were gone\r\nhome, and the Ernescliffes and Harry off by the train, there were still\r\nfour mortal hours of daylight, and oh! for Mary\'s power of making every\r\none happy!\r\n\r\nCaroline and Annie Cheviot were ladylike, nice-looking girls; but when\r\nthey found no croquet mallets in the garden, they seemed at a loss what\r\nlife had to offer at Stoneborough!  Gertrude pronounced that \'she\r\nplayed at it sometimes at Maplewood, where she had nothing better to\r\ndo,\' and then retreated to her own devices.  Ethel\'s heart sank both\r\nwith dread of the afternoon, and with self-reproach at her spoilt\r\nchild\'s discourtesy, whence she knew there would be no rousing her\r\nwithout an incapacitating discussion; and on she wandered in the garden\r\nwith the guests, receiving instruction where the hoops might be\r\nplanted, and hearing how nice it would be for her sister to have such\r\nan object, such a pleasant opportunity of meeting one\'s friends--an\r\ninterest for every day.  \'No wonder they think I want an object in\r\nlife,\' thought Ethel; \'how awfully tiresome I must be!  Poor things,\r\nwhat can I say to make it pleasanter?--Do you know this Dielytra?  I\r\nthink it is the prettiest of modern flowers, but I wish we might call\r\nit Japan fumitory, or by some English name.\'\r\n\r\n\'I used to garden once, but we have no flower-beds now, they spoilt the\r\nlawn for croquet.\'\r\n\r\n\'And here comes Tom,\' thought Ethel; \'poor Tom, he will certainly be\r\noff to London this evening.\'\r\n\r\nTom, however, joined the listless promenade; and the first time croquet\r\nwas again mentioned, observed that he had seen the Andersons knocking\r\nabout the balls in the new gardens by the river; and proposed to go\r\ndown and try to get up a match.  There was an instant brightening, and\r\nTom stepped into the drawing-room, and told Daisy to come with them.\r\n\r\n\'To play at croquet with the Andersons in the tea-gardens!\' she\r\nexclaimed.  \'No, I thank you, Thomas!\'\r\n\r\nHe laid his hand on her shoulder--\'Gertrude,\' he said, \'it is time to\r\nhave done being a spoilt baby.  If you let Ethel fag herself ill, you\r\nwill rue it all your life.\'\r\n\r\nFrightened, but without clear comprehension, she turned two scared eyes\r\non him, and replaced the hat that she had thrown on the table, just as\r\nEthel and the others came in.\r\n\r\n\'Not you, Ethel,\' said Tom; \'you don\'t know the game.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can learn,\' said Ethel, desperately bent on her duty.\r\n\r\n\'We would teach you,\' volunteered the Cheviots.\r\n\r\n\'You would not undertake it if you knew better,\' said Tom, smiling.\r\n\'Ethel\'s hands are not her strong point.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ethel would just have to be croqued all through by her partner,\' said\r\nGertrude.\r\n\r\n\'Besides, my father will be coming in and wanting you,\' added Tom; \'he\r\nis only at the hospital or somewhere about the town.  I\'ll look after\r\nthis child.\'\r\n\r\nAnd the two sisters, delighted that poor little Gertrude should have\r\nsuch a holiday treat as croquet in the public gardens, away from her\r\ngoverness elder sister, walked off glorious; while Ethel, breathing\r\nforth a heavy sigh, let herself sink into a chair, feeling as if the\r\nsilence were in itself invaluable, and as if Tom could not be enough\r\nthanked for having gained it for her.\r\n\r\nShe was first roused by the inquiry, \'Shall I take in this letter,\r\nma\'am? it is charged four shillings over-weight.  And it is for Mr.\r\nThomas, ma\'am,\' impressively concluded the parlour-maid, as one\r\npenetrated by Mr. Thomas\'s regard to small economies.\r\n\r\nEthel beheld a letter bloated beyond the capacities of the two bewigged\r\nWashingtons that kept guard in its corner, and addressed in a cramped\r\nhand unknown to her; but while she hesitated, her eye fell on another\r\nAmerican letter directed to Miss Mary May, in Averil Ward\'s well-known\r\nwriting, and turning both round, she found they had the same post-mark,\r\nand thereupon paid the extra charge, and placed the letter where Tom\r\nwas most likely to light naturally on it without public comment.  The\r\nother letter renewed the pang at common property being at an end.  \'No,\r\nMab,\' she said, taking the little dog into her lap, \'we shall none of\r\nus hear a bit of it!  But at least it is a comfort that this business\r\nis over!  You needn\'t creep under sofas now, there\'s nobody to tread\r\nupon your dainty little paws.  What is to be done, Mab, to get out of a\r\nsavage humour--except thinking how good-natured poor Tom is!\'\r\n\r\nThere was not much sign of savage humour in the face that was lifted up\r\nas Dr. May came in from the hospital, and sitting down by his daughter,\r\nput his arm round her.  \'So there\'s another bird flown,\' he said.  \'We\r\nshall soon have the old nest to ourselves, Ethel.\'\r\n\r\n\'The Daisy is not going just yet,\' said Ethel, stroking back the thin\r\nflying flakes over his temples.  \'If we may believe her, never!\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah! she will be off before we can look round,\' said the Doctor; \'when\r\nonce the trick of marrying gets among one\'s girls, there\'s no end to\r\nit, as long as they last out.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nor to one\'s boys going out into the world,\' said Ethel: both of them\r\ntalking as if she had been his wife, rather than one of these fly-away\r\nyounglings herself.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! well,\' he said, \'it\'s very pretty while it lasts, and one keeps\r\nthe creatures; but after all, one doesn\'t rear them for one\'s own\r\npleasure.  That only comes by the way of their chance good-will to one.\'\r\n\r\n\'For shame, Doctor!\' said Ethel, pretending to shake him by the collar.\r\n\r\n\'I was thinking,\' he added, \'that we must not require too much. People\r\nmust have their day, and in their own fashion; and I wish you would\r\ntell Tom--I\'ve no patience to do it myself--that I don\'t mean to hamper\r\nhim.  As long as it is a right line, he may take whichever he pleases,\r\nand I\'ll do my best to set him forward in it; but it is a pity--\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps a few years of travelling, or of a professorship, might give\r\nhim time to think differently,\' said Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'Not he,\' said the Doctor; \'the more a man lives in the world, the more\r\nhe depends on it.  Where is the boy? is he gone without vouchsafing a\r\ngood-bye?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh no, he has taken pity on Annie and Caroline Cheviot\'s famine of\r\ncroquet, and gone with them to the gardens.\'\r\n\r\n\'A spice of flirtation never comes amiss to him.\'\r\n\r\n\'There, that\'s the way!\' said Ethel, half-saucily, half-caressingly;\r\n\'that poor fellow never can do right!  Isn\'t it the very thing to keep\r\nhim away from home, that we all may steal a horse, and he can\'t look\r\nover the wall, no, not with a telescope?\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t help it, Ethel.  It may be very wrong and unkind of me--Heaven\r\nforgive me if it is, and prevent me from doing the boy any harm! but I\r\nnever can rid myself of a feeling of there being something behind when\r\nhe seems the most straightforward.  If he had only not got his\r\ngrandfather\'s mouth and nose!  And,\' smiling after all--\'I don\'t know\r\nwhat I said to be so scolded; all lads flirt, and you can\'t deny that\r\nMaster Tom divided his attentions pretty freely last year between Mrs.\r\nPugh and poor Ave Ward.\'\r\n\r\n\'This time, I believe, it was out of pure kindness to me,\' said Ethel,\r\n\'so I am bound to his defence.  He dragged off poor Daisy to chaperon\r\nthem, that I might have a little peace.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah! he came down on us this morning,\' said the Doctor, \'on Richard and\r\nFlora and me, and gave us a lecture on letting you grow old,\r\nEthel--said you were getting over-tasked, and no one heeding it; and\r\nlooking--let\'s look\'--and he took off his spectacles, put his hand on\r\nher shoulder, and studied her face.\r\n\r\n\'Old enough to be a respectable lady of the house, I hope,\' said Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'Wiry enough for most things,\' said the Doctor, patting her shoulder,\r\nreassured; \'but we must take care, Ethel; if you don\'t fatten yourself\r\nup, we shall have Flora coming and carrying you off to London for a\r\nchange, and for Tom to practise on.\r\n\r\n\'That is a threat!  I expected he had been prescribing for me already,\r\nnever to go near Cocksmoor, for that\'s what people always begin by--\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothing worse than pale ale.\'  At which Ethel made one of her faces.\r\n\'And to make a Mary of that chit of a Daisy.  Well, you may do as you\r\nplease--only take care, or Flora will be down upon us.\'\r\n\r\n\'Tom has been very helpful and kind to me,\' said Ethel.  \'And, papa, he\r\nhas seen Leonard, and he says he looked so noble that to shake hands\r\nwith him made him feel quite small.\'\r\n\r\n\'I never heard anything so much to Tom\'s credit!  Well, and what did he\r\nsay of the dear lad?\'\r\n\r\nThe next step was to mention Averil\'s letter to Mary, which could not\r\nbe sent on till tidings had been permitted by Mr. Cheviot.\r\n\r\n\'Let us see it,\' said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\'Do you think Charles Cheviot would like it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Cheviot is a man of sense,\' said the open-hearted Doctor, \'and there\r\nmay be something to authorize preventing this unlucky transfer of her\r\nfortune.\'\r\n\r\nNothing could be further from it; but it was a long and interesting\r\nletter, written in evidently exhilarated spirits, and with a hopeful\r\ndescription of the new scenes.  Ethel read it to her father, and he\r\ntold every one about it when they came in.  Tom manifested no\r\nparticular interest; but he did not go by the mail train that night,\r\nand was not visible all the morning.  He caught Ethel alone however at\r\nnoon, and said, \'Ethel, I owe you this,\' offering the amount she had\r\npaid for the letter.\r\n\r\n\'Thank you,\' she said, wondering if this was to be all she should hear\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\n\'I am going by the afternoon train,\' he added; \'I have been over to\r\nBlewer.  It is true, Ethel, the fellow can\'t stand it! he has sent down\r\na manager, and is always in London!  Most likely to dispose of it by\r\nprivate contract there, they say.\'\r\n\r\n\'And what has become of old Hardy?\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor old fellow, he has struck work, looks terribly shaky.  He took me\r\nfor my father at first sight, and began to apologize most\r\nplaintively--said no one else had ever done him any good.  I advised\r\nhim to come in and see my father, though he is too far gone to do much\r\nfor him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor old man, can he afford to come in now?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, I helped him with the cart hire.  It is no use any way, he knows\r\nno more than we do, and his case is confirmed; but he thinks he has\r\noffended my father, and he\'ll die more in peace for having had him\r\nagain.  Look here, what a place they have got to.\'\r\n\r\nAnd without further explanation of the \'they,\' Tom placed a letter in\r\nEthel\'s hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\'My Dear Mr. Thomas,\r\n\r\n\'I send you the objects I promised for your microscope; I could not get\r\nany before because we were in the city; but if you like these I can get\r\nplenty more at Massissauga, where we are now.  We came here last week,\r\nand the journey was very nice, only we went bump bump so often, and\r\nonce we stuck in a marsh, and were splashed all over.  We are staying\r\nwith Mr. Muller and Cora till our own house is quite ready; it was only\r\nbegun a fortnight ago, and we are to get in next week.  I thought this\r\nwould have been a town, it looked so big and so square in the plan; but\r\nit is all trees still, and there are only thirteen houses built yet.\r\nOurs is all by itself in River Street, and all the trees near it have\r\nbeen killed, and stand up all dead and white, because nobody has time\r\nto cut them down.  It looks very dismal, but Ave says it will be very\r\nnice by and by, and, Rufus Muller says it has mammoth privileges.  I\r\nsend you a bit of rattlesnake skin.  They found fifteen of them asleep\r\nunder a stone, just where our house is built, and sometimes they come\r\ninto the kitchen.  I do not know the names of the other things I send;\r\nand I could not ask Ave, for she said you would not want to be bothered\r\nwith a little girl\'s letter, and I was not to ask for an answer. Rosa\r\nWillis says no young lady of my age would ask her sister\'s permission,\r\nand not even her mother\'s, unless her mamma was very intellectual and\r\nhighly educated, and always saw the justice of her arguments; but Minna\r\nand I do not mean to be like that.  I would tell Ave if you did write\r\nto me, but she need not read it unless she liked.\r\n\r\n                       \'I am, your affectionate little friend,\r\n                                                           \'ELLA.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Well!\' said Tom, holding out his hand for more when she had restored\r\nthis epistle.  \'You have heard all there was in it, except--\'\r\n\r\n\'Except what I want to see.\'\r\n\r\nAnd Ethel, as she had more or less intended all along, let him have\r\nAveril\'s letter, since the exception was merely a few tender words of\r\ncongratulation to Mary.  The worst had been done already by her father;\r\nand it may here be mentioned that though nothing was said in answer to\r\nher explanation of the opening of the letter, the head-master never\r\nrecovered the fact, and always attributed it to his dear sister Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'For the future,\' said Tom, as he gave back the thin sheets, \'they will\r\nall be for the Cheviots\' private delectation.\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall begin on my own score,\' said Ethel.  \'You know if you answer\r\nthis letter, you must not mention that visit of yours, or you will be\r\nprohibited, and one would not wish to excite a domestic secession.\'\r\n\r\n\'It would serve the unnatural scoundrel right,\' said Tom.  \'Well, I\r\nmust go and put up my things.  You\'ll keep me up to what goes on at\r\nhome, and if there\'s anything out there to tell Leonard--\'\r\n\r\n\'Wait a moment, Tom!\'--and she told him what the Doctor had said about\r\nhis plans.\r\n\r\n\'Highly educated and intellectual,\' was all the answer that Tom\r\nvouchsafed; and whether he were touched or not she could not gather.\r\n\r\nYet her spirit felt less weary and burdened, and more full of hope than\r\nit had been for a long time past.  Averil\'s letter showed the\r\nexhilaration of the change, and of increasing confidence and comfort in\r\nher friend Cora Muller.  Cora\'s Confirmation had brought the girls into\r\ncontact with the New York clergy, and had procured them an introduction\r\nto the clergyman of Winiamac, the nearest church, so that there was\r\nmuch less sense of loneliness, moreover, the fuller and more systematic\r\ndoctrine, and the development of the beauty and daily guidance of the\r\nChurch, had softened the bright American girl, so as to render her\r\ninfinitely dearer to her English friend, and they were as much united\r\nas they could be, where the great leading event of the life of one\r\nremained a mystery to the other.  Yet perhaps it helped to begin a\r\nfresh life, that the intimate companion of that new course should be\r\nentirely disconnected with the past.\r\n\r\nAveril threw herself into the present with as resolute a will as she\r\ncould muster.  With much spirit she described the arrival at the\r\nWiniamac station, and the unconcealed contempt with which the mass of\r\nluggage was regarded by the Western world, who \'reckoned it would be\r\nfittest to make kindlings with.\'  Heavy country wagons were to bring\r\nthe furniture; the party themselves were provided for by a light wagon\r\nand a large cart, driven by Cora\'s brother, Mordaunt, and by the\r\nfarming-man, Philetus, a gentleman who took every occasion of asserting\r\nhis equality, if not his superiority to the new-comers; demanded all\r\nthe Christian names, and used them without prefix; and when Henry\r\nimpressively mentioned his eldest sister as Miss Warden, stared and\r\nsaid, \'Why, Doctor, I thought she was not your old woman!\'--the Western\r\nepithet of a wife.  But as Cora was quite content to leave Miss behind\r\nher in civilized society, and as they were assured that to stand upon\r\nceremony would leave them without domestic assistance, the sisters had\r\nimplored Henry to waive all preference for a polite address.\r\n\r\nThe loveliness of the way was enchanting--the roads running straight as\r\nan arrow through glorious forest lands of pine, beech, maple, and oak,\r\nin the full glory of spring, and the perspective before and behind\r\nmaking a long narrowing green bower of meeting branches; the whole of\r\nthe borders of the road covered with lovely flowers--May-wings, a\r\nbutterfly-like milkwort, pitcher-plant, convolvulus; new insects danced\r\nin the shade--golden orioles, blue birds, the great American robin, the\r\nfield officer, with his orange epaulettes, glanced before them.  Cora\r\nwas in ecstasy at the return to forest scenery, the Wards at its\r\nnovelty, and the escape from town.  Too happy were they at first to\r\ncare for the shaking and bumping of the road, and the first mud-hole\r\ninto which they plunged was almost a joke, under Mordaunt Muller\'s\r\nassurances that it was easy fording, though the splashes flew far and\r\nwide.  Then there was what Philetus called \'a mash with a real handsome\r\nbridge over it,\' i. e. a succession of tree trunks laid side by side\r\nfor about a quarter of a mile.  Here the female passengers insisted on\r\nwalking--even Cora, though her brother and Philetus both laughed her to\r\nscorn; and more especially for her foot-gear, delicate kid boots,\r\nwithout which no city damsel stirred.  Averil and her sisters, in the\r\nEnglish boots scorned at New York, had their share in the laugh, while\r\npicking their way from log to log, hand in hand, and exciting\r\nPhiletus\'s further disdain by their rapture with the glorious flowers\r\nof the bog.\r\n\r\nBut where was Massissauga?  Several settlements had been passed, the\r\nhouses looking clean and white in forest openings, with fields where\r\nthe lovely spring green of young maize charmed the eye.\r\n\r\nAt last the road grew desolate.  There were a few patches of corn, a\r\nfew squalid-looking log or frame houses, a tract of horrible dreary\r\nblackness; and still more horrible, beyond it was a region of\r\nspectres--trees white and stripped bare, lifting their dead arms like\r\nthings blasted.  Averil cried out in indignant horror, \'Who has done\r\nthis?\'\r\n\r\n\'We have,\' answered Mordaunt.  \'This is Maclellan Square, Miss Warden,\r\nand there\'s River Street,\' pointing down an avenue of skeletons.  \'If\r\nyou could go to sleep for a couple of years, you would wake up to find\r\nyourself in a city such as I would not fear to compare with any in\r\nEurope.  Your exhausted civilization is not as energetic as ours, I\r\ncalculate.\'\r\n\r\nThe energetic young colonist turned his horse\'s head up a slight rising\r\nground, where something rather more like habitation appeared; a great\r\nbrick-built hotel, and some log houses, with windows displaying the\r\nwares needed for daily consumption, and a few farm buildings.  It was\r\nbacked by corn-fields; and this was the great Maclellan Street, the\r\nchief ornament of Massissauga.  Not one house had the semblance of a\r\ngarden; the wilderness came up to the very door, except where cattle\r\nrendered some sort of enclosure necessary.\r\n\r\nCora exclaimed, \'Oh, Mordaunt, I thought you would have had a garden\r\nfor me!\'\r\n\r\n\'I can fix it any time you like,\' said he; \'but you\'ll be the\r\nlaughing-stock of the place, and never keep a flower.\'\r\n\r\nThe Mullers\' abode was a sound substantial log house, neatly whitened,\r\nand with green shutters, bearing a festal appearance, full of welcome,\r\nas Mr. Muller, his tall bearded son Rufus, and a thin but\r\nmotherly-looking elderly woman, came forth to meet the travellers; and\r\nin the front, full stare, stood a trollopy-looking girl, every bar of\r\nher enormous hoop plainly visible through her washed-out flimsy muslin.\r\nThis was Miss Ianthe, who condescended to favour the family with her\r\nassistance till she should have made up dollars enough to buy a new\r\ndress!  The elder woman, who went by the name of Cousin Deborah, would\r\nhave been a housekeeper in England--here she was one of the\r\nfamily--welcomed Cora with an exchange of kisses, and received the\r\nstrangers with very substantial hospitality, though with pity at their\r\nunfitness for their new home, and utter incredulity as to their success.\r\n\r\nHere the Wards had been since their arrival.  Their frame-house, near\r\nthe verdant bank of the river, was being finished for them; and a great\r\nbrass plate, with Henry\'s new name and his profession, had already\r\nadorned the door.  The furniture was coming; Cousin Deborah had hunted\r\nup a Cleopatra Betsy, who might perhaps stay with them if she were\r\ntreated on terms of equality, a field was to be brought into\r\ncultivation as soon as any labour could be had.  Minna was looking\r\ninfinitely better already, and Averil and Cora were full of designs for\r\nrival housewifery, Averil taking lessons meantime in ironing, dusting,\r\nand the arts of the kitchen, and trusting that in the two years\' time,\r\nthe skeletons would have given place--if not indeed to houses, to\r\nwell-kept fields.  Such was her account.\r\n\r\nHow much was reserved for fear of causing anxiety?  Who could guess?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n                   Quanto si fende\r\n  La rocca per dar via a chi va suso\r\n  N\'andai \'nfino ove\'l cerchiar si prende\r\n  Com\'io nel quinto giro fui dischiuso\r\n  Vidi gente per esso che piangea\r\n  Glacendo a terra tutta volta in giuso\r\n  Adhaesit pavimento anima mia\r\n  Sentia dir loro con si alti sospiri\r\n  Che la parola appena s\'intendea.\r\n  \'O eletti di Deo, i cui soffriri\r\n  E giustizia e speranza fan men duri--\'\r\n                               DANTE. Purgatorio\r\n\r\n\r\nAh, sir, we have learnt the way to get your company,\' said Hector\r\nErnescliffe, as he welcomed his father-in-law at Maplewood; \'we have\r\nonly to get under sentence.\'\r\n\r\n\'Sick or sorry, Hector; that\'s the attraction to an old doctor.\'\r\n\r\n\'And,\' added Hector, with the importance of his youthful magisterial\r\ndignity, \'I hope I have arranged matters for you to see him.  I wrote\r\nabout it; but I am afraid you will not be able to see him alone.\'\r\n\r\nGreat was the satisfaction with which Hector took the conduct of the\r\nexpedition to Portland Island; though he was inclined to encumber it\r\nwith more lionizing than the good Doctor\'s full heart was ready for.\r\nFew words could he obtain, as in the bright August sunshine they\r\nsteamed out from the pier at Weymouth, and beheld the gray sides of the\r\nisland, scarred with stone quarries, stretching its lengthening\r\nbreakwater out on one side, and on the other connected with the land by\r\nthe pale dim outline of the Chesill Bank.  The water was dancing in\r\ngolden light; white-sailed or red-sailed craft plied across it; a ship\r\nof the line lay under the lee of the island, practising gunnery, the\r\nthree bounds of her balls marked by white columns of spray each time of\r\ntouching the water, pleasure parties crowded the steamer; but to Dr.\r\nMay the cheerfulness of the scene made a depressing contrast to the\r\npurpose of his visit, as he fixed his eyes on the squared outline of\r\nthe crest of the island, and the precipitous slope from thence to the\r\nbreakwater, where trains of loaded trucks rushed forth to the end,\r\ndischarged themselves, and hurried back.\r\n\r\nLanding at the quay, in the midst of confusion, Hector smiled at the\r\nDoctor\'s innocent proposal of walking, and bestowed him in a little\r\ncarriage, with a horse whose hard-worked patience was soon called out,\r\nas up and up they went, through the narrow, but lively street, past the\r\nold-fashioned inn, made memorable by a dinner of George III.; past the\r\nfossil tree, clamped against a house like a vine; past heaps of slabs\r\nready for transport, a church perched up high on the slope, and a\r\nparsonage in a place that looked only accessible to goats.  Lines of\r\nfortification began to reveal themselves, and the Doctor thought\r\nhimself arrived, but he was to wind further on, and be more struck with\r\nthe dreariness and inhospitality of the rugged rock, almost bare of\r\nvegetation, the very trees of stone, and older than our creation; the\r\nmelancholy late ripening harvest within stone walls, the whole surface\r\nfurrowed by stern rents and crevices riven by nature, or cut into\r\ngreater harshness by the quarries hewn by man. The grave strangeness of\r\nthe region almost marked it out for a place of expiation, like the\r\nmountain rising desolate from the sea, where Dante placed his prisoners\r\nof hope.\r\n\r\nThe walls of a vast enclosure became visible; and over them might be\r\nseen the tops of great cranes, looking like the denuded ribs of\r\numbrellas.  Buildings rose beyond, with deep arched gateways; and a\r\nsmall town was to be seen further off.  Mr. Ernescliffe sent in his\r\ncard at the governor\'s house, and found that the facilities he had\r\nasked for had been granted.  They were told that the prisoner they\r\nwished to see was at work at some distance; and while he was summoned,\r\nthey were to see the buildings.  Dr. May had little heart for making a\r\nsight of them, except so far as to judge of Leonard\'s situation; and he\r\nwas passively conducted across a gravelled court, turfed in the centre,\r\nand containing a few flower-beds, fenced in by Portland\'s most natural\r\nproductions, zamias and ammonites, together with a few stone coffins,\r\nwhich had once inclosed corpses of soldiers of the Roman garrison.\r\nLarge piles of building inclosed the quadrangle; and passing into the\r\nfirst of these, the Doctor began to realize something of Leonard\'s\r\npresent existence.  There lay before him the broad airy passage, and\r\neither side the empty cells of this strange hive, as closely packed,\r\nand as chary of space, as the compartments of the workers of the\r\nhoneycomb.\r\n\r\n\'Just twice as wide as a coffin,\' said Hector, doing the honours of\r\none, where there was exactly width to stand up between the bed and the\r\nwall of corrugated iron; \'though, happily, there is more liberality of\r\nheight.\'\r\n\r\nThere was a ground glass window opposite to the door, and a shelf,\r\nholding a Bible, Prayer and hymn book, and two others, one religious,\r\nand one secular, from the library.  A rust-coloured jacket, with a\r\nblack patch marked with white numbers, and a tarpaulin hat, crossed\r\nwith two lines of red paint on the crown, hung on the wall.  The Doctor\r\nasked for Leonard\'s cell, but it was in a distant gallery, and he was\r\ntold that when he had seen one, he had seen all.  He asked if these\r\nwere like those that Leonard had previously inhabited at Milbank and\r\nPentonville, and hearing that they were on the same model, he almost\r\ngasped at the thought of the young enterprising spirit thus caged for\r\nnine weary months, and to whom this bare confined space was still the\r\nonly resting-place.  He could not look by any means delighted with the\r\nexcellence of the arrangements, grant it though he might; and he was\r\nhurried on to the vast kitchens, their ranges of coppers full of\r\nsavoury steaming contents, and their racks of loaves looking all that\r\nwas substantial and wholesome; but his eyes were wandering after the\r\nfigures engaged in cooking, to whom he was told such work was a reward;\r\nhe was trying to judge how far they could still enjoy life; but he\r\nturned from their stolid low stamp of face with a sigh, thinking how\r\nlittle their condition could tell him of that of a cultivated nature.\r\n\r\nHe was shown the chapel, unfortunately serving likewise for a\r\nschoolroom; the centre space fitted for the officials and their\r\nfamilies, the rest with plain wooden benches.  But it was not an hour\r\nfor schooling, and he went restlessly on to the library, to gather all\r\nthe consolation he could from seeing that the privation did not extend\r\nto that of sound and interesting literature.  He had yet to see the\r\ncourt, where the prisoners were mustered at half-past five in the\r\nmorning, thence to be marched off in their various companies to work.\r\nHe stood on the terrace from which the officials marshalled them, and\r\nhe was called on to look at the wide and magnificent view of sea and\r\nland; but all he would observe to Hector was, \'That boy\'s throat has\r\nalways been tender since the fever.\'  He was next conducted to the\r\ngreat court, the quarry of the stones of the present St. Paul\'s, and\r\nwhere the depression of the surface since work began there, was marked\r\nby the present height of what had become a steep conical edifice,\r\nsurmounted by a sort of watch-tower.  There he grew quite restive, and\r\nhearing a proposal of taking him to the Verne Hill works half a mile\r\noff, he declared that Hector was welcome to go; he should wait for his\r\nboy.\r\n\r\nJust then the guide pointed out at some distance a convict approaching\r\nunder charge of a warder; and in a few seconds more, the Doctor had\r\nstepped back to a small room, where, by special favour, he was allowed\r\nto be with the prisoner, instead of seeing him through a grating, but\r\nonly in the presence of a warder, who was within hearing, though not\r\nobtrusively so.  Looking, to recognize, not to examine, he drew the\r\nyoung man into his fatherly embrace.\r\n\r\n\'You have hurt your hands,\' was his first word, at the touch of the\r\nbruised fingers and broken skin.\r\n\r\n\'They are getting hardened,\' was the answer, in an alert tone, that\r\ngave the Doctor courage to look up and meet an unquenched glance;\r\nthough there was the hollow look round the eyes that Tom had noticed,\r\nthe face had grown older, the expression more concentrated, the\r\nshoulders had rounded; the coarse blue shirt and heavy boots were dusty\r\nwith the morning\'s toil, and the heat and labour of the day had left\r\ntheir tokens, but the brow was as open, the mouth as ingenuous as ever,\r\nthe complexion had regained a hue of health, and the air of alacrity\r\nand exhilaration surprised as much as it gratified the visitor.\r\n\r\n\'What is your work?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'Filling barrows with stones, and wheeling them to the trucks for the\r\nbreakwater,\' answered Leonard, in a tone like satisfaction.  \'But pray,\r\nif you are so kind, tell me,\' he continued, with anxiety that he could\r\nnot suppress, \'what is this about war in America?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not near Indiana; no fear of that, I trust.  But how did you know,\r\nLeonard?\'\r\n\r\n\'I saw, for one moment at a time, in great letters on a placard of the\r\ncontents of newspapers, at the stations as we came down here, the\r\nwords, \'Civil War in America;\' and it has seemed to be in the air here\r\never since.  But Averil has said nothing in her letters.  Will it\r\naffect them?\'\r\n\r\nThe Doctor gave a brief sketch of what was passing, up to the battle of\r\nBull Run; and his words were listened to with such exceeding avidity,\r\nthat he was obliged to spend more minutes than he desired on the\r\nchances of the war, and the Massissauga tidings, which he wished to\r\nmake sound more favourable than he could in conscience feel that they\r\nwere; but when at last he had detailed all he knew from Averil\'s\r\nletters, and it had been drunk in with glistening eyes, and manner\r\ngrowing constantly less constrained, he led back to Leonard himself:\r\n\'Ethel will write at once to your sister when I get home; and I think I\r\nmay tell her the work agrees with you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; and this is man\'s work; and it is for the defences,\' he added,\r\nwith a sparkle of the eye.\r\n\r\n\'Very hard and rough,\' returned the Doctor, looking again at the\r\nwounded hands and hard-worked air.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, but to put out one\'s strength again, and have room!\' cried the\r\nboy, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\'Was it not rather a trying change at first?\'\r\n\r\n\'To be sure I was stiff, and didn\'t know how to move in the morning,\r\nbut that went off fast enough; and I fill as many barrows a day as any\r\none in our gang.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then I may tell your sister you rejoice in the change?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, it\'s work one does not get deadly sick of, as if there was no\r\nmaking one\'s self do it,\' said Leonard, eagerly; \'it is work! and\r\nbesides, here is sunshine and sea.  I can get a sight of that every\r\nday; and now and then I can get a look into the bay, and\r\nWeymouth--looking like the old time.\'  That was his first sorrowful\r\nintonation; but the next had the freshness of his age, \'And there are\r\nthistles!\'\r\n\r\n\'Thistles?\'\r\n\r\n\'I thought you cared for thistles; for Miss May showed me one at\r\nCoombe; but it was not like what they are here--the spikes pointing out\r\nand pointing in along the edges of the leaves, and the scales lapping\r\nover so wonderfully in the bud.\'\r\n\r\n\'Picciola!\' said the Doctor to himself; and aloud,  \'Then you have time\r\nto enjoy them?\'\r\n\r\n\'When we are at work at a distance, dinner is brought out, and there is\r\nan hour and a half of rest; and on Sunday we may walk about the yards.\r\nYou should have seen one of our gang, when I got him to look at the\r\nchevaux de frise round a bud, how he owned it was a regular patent\r\ninvention; it just answered to Paley\'s illustration.\'\r\n\r\n\'What, the watch?\' said the Doctor, seeing that the argument had been\r\nfar from trite to his young friend.  \'So you read Paley?\'\r\n\r\n\'I read all such books as I could get up there,\' he answered; \'they\r\ngave one something to think about.\'\r\n\r\n\'Have you no time for reading here?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, no!  I am too sleepy to read except on school days and Sundays,\'\r\nhe said, as if this were a great achievement.\r\n\r\n\'And your acquaintance--is he a reader of Paley too?\'\r\n\r\n\'I believe the chaplain set him on it.  He is a clerk, like me, and not\r\nmuch older.  He is a regular Londoner, and can hardly stand the work;\r\nbut he won\'t give in if he can help it, or we might not be together.\'\r\n\r\nMuch the Doctor longed to ask what sort of a friend this might be, but\r\nthe warder\'s presence forbade him; and he could only ask what they saw\r\nof each other.\r\n\r\n\'We were near one another in school at Pentonville, and knew each\r\nother\'s faces quite well, so that we were right glad to be put into the\r\nsame gang.  We may walk about the yard together on Sunday evening too.\'\r\n\r\nThe Doctor had other questions on his lips that he again restrained,\r\nand only asked whether the Sundays were comfortable days.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, yes,\' said Leonard, eagerly; but then he too recollected the\r\nofficial, and merely said something commonplace about excellent\r\nsermons, adding, \'And the singing is admirable.  Poor Averil would envy\r\nsuch a choir as we have!  We sing so many of the old Bankside hymns.\'\r\n\r\n\'To make your resemblance to Dante\'s hill of penitence complete, as\r\nEthel says,\' returned the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\'I should like it to be a hill of purification!\' said Leonard,\r\nunderstanding him better than he had expected.\r\n\r\n\'It will, I think,\' said the Doctor, \'to one at least.  I am comforted\r\nto see you so brave.  I longed to come sooner, but--\'\r\n\r\n\'I am glad you did not.\'\r\n\r\n\'How?\'  But he did not pursue the question, catching from look and\r\ngesture, that Leonard could hardly have then met him with\r\nself-possession; and as the first bulletin of recovery is often the\r\nfirst disclosure of the severity of an illness, so the Doctor was more\r\nimpressed by the prisoner\'s evident satisfaction in his change of\r\ncircumstances, than he would have been by mere patient resignation; and\r\nhe let the conversation be led away to Aubrey\'s prospects, in which\r\nLeonard took full and eager interest.\r\n\r\n\'Tell Aubrey I am working at fortifications too,\' he said, smiling.\r\n\r\n\'He could not go to Cambridge without you.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t like to believe that,\' said Leonard, gravely; \'it is carrying\r\nthe damage I have done further: but it can\'t be.  He always was fond of\r\nmathematics, and of soldiering.  How is it at the old mill?\' he added,\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n\'It is sold.\'\r\n\r\n\'Sold?\' and his eyes were intently fixed on the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, he is said to have been much in debt long before; but it was\r\nmanaged quietly--not advertised in the county papers.  He went to\r\nLondon, and arranged it all.  I saw great renovations going on at the\r\nmill, when I went to see old Hardy.\'\r\n\r\n\'Good old Hardy! how is he?\'\r\n\r\n\'Much broken.  He never got over the shock; and as long as that fellow\r\nstayed at the mill, he would not let me attend him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ha!\' exclaimed Leonard, but caught himself up.\r\n\r\nA message came that Mr. Ernescliffe feared to miss the boat; and the\r\nDoctor could only give one tender grasp and murmured blessing, and\r\nhurry away, so much agitated that he could hardly join in Hector\'s\r\ncivilities to the officials, and all the evening seemed quite struck\r\ndown and overwhelmed by the sight of the bright brave boy, and his\r\npatience in his dreary lot.\r\n\r\nAfter this, at all the three months\' intervals at which Leonard might\r\nbe seen, a visit was contrived to him, either by Dr. May or Mr. Wilmot;\r\nand Aubrey devoted his first leave of absence to staying at Maplewood,\r\nthat Hector might take him to his friend; but he came home expatiating\r\nso much on the red hair of the infant hope of Maplewood, and the fuss\r\nthat Blanche made about this new possession, that Ethel detected an\r\nunavowed shade of disappointment.  Light and whitewash, abundant fare,\r\ngarments sufficient, but eminently unbecoming, were less impressive\r\nthan dungeons, rags, and bread and water; when, moreover, the prisoner\r\nclaimed no pity, but rather congratulation on his badge of merit,\r\nimproved Sunday dinner, and promotion to the carpenter\'s shop, so as\r\nabsolutely to excite a sense of wasted commiseration and uninteresting\r\nprosperity.  Conversation constrained both by the grating and the\r\npresence of the warder, and Aubrey, more tenderly sensitive than his\r\nbrother, and devoid of his father\'s experienced tact, was too much\r\nembarrassed to take the initiative, was afraid of giving pain by\r\ndwelling on his present occupations and future hopes, and confused\r\nLeonard by his embarrassment.  Hector Ernescliffe discoursed about\r\nCharleston Harbour and New Orleans; and Aubrey stood with downcast\r\neyes, afraid to seem to be scanning the convict garb, and thus\r\nrendering Leonard unusually conscious of wearing it.  Then when in\r\nparting, Aubrey, a little less embarrassed, began eagerly and in much\r\nemotion to beg Leonard to say if there was anything he could get for\r\nhim, anything he could do for him, anything he would like to have sent\r\nhim, and began to promise a photograph of his father, Leonard checked\r\nhim, by answering that it would be an irregularity--nothing of personal\r\nproperty was allowed to be retained by a prisoner.\r\n\r\nAubrey forgot all but the hardship, and began an outburst about the\r\ntyranny.\r\n\r\n\'It is quite right,\' said Leonard, gravely; \'there is nothing that\r\nmight not be used for mischief if one chose.\'\r\n\r\nAnd the warder here interfered, and said he was quite right, and it\r\nalways turned out best in the end for a prisoner to conform himself,\r\nand his friends did him no good by any other attempt, as Mr.\r\nErnescliffe could tell the young gentleman.  The man\'s tone, though\r\nneither insolent nor tyrannical, but rather commendatory of his charge,\r\ncontrasting with his natural deference to the two gentlemen, irritated\r\npoor Aubrey beyond measure, so that Hector was really glad to have him\r\nsafe away, without his having said anything treasonable to the\r\nauthorities.  The meeting, so constrained and uncomfortable, had but\r\nmade the friends more vividly conscious of the interval between the\r\ncadet and the convict, and, moreover, tended to remove the aureole of\r\nromance with which the unseen captive had been invested by youthful\r\nfancy.\r\n\r\nTo make the best of a prolonged misfortune does absolutely lessen\r\nsympathy, by diminishing the interest of the situation; and even the\r\ngood Doctor himself was the less concerned at any hindrance to his\r\nvisits to Portland, as he uniformly found his prisoner cheerful,\r\napproved by officials, and always making some small advance in the\r\nscale of his own world, and not, as his friends without expected of\r\nhim, showing that he felt himself injured instead of elated by such\r\nrewards as improved diet, or increased gratuities to be set to his\r\naccount against the time when, after eight years, he might hope for\r\nexportation with a ticket of leave to Western Australia.\r\n\r\nThe halo of approaching death no longer lighted him up, and after the\r\neffusion of the first meeting, his inner self had closed up, he was\r\nmore ready to talk of American news than of his own feelings, and\r\nseemed to look little beyond the petty encouragements devised to suit\r\nthe animal natures of ordinary prisoners, and his visitors sometimes\r\nfeared lest his character were not resisting the deadening, hardening\r\ninfluence of the unvaried round of manual labour among such associates.\r\nHe had been soon advanced from the quarry to the carpenter\'s shop, and\r\nwas in favour there from his activity and skill; but his very\r\npromotions were sad--and it was more sad, as some thought, for him to\r\nbe gratified by them.  But, as Dr. May always ended, what did they know\r\nabout him?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n  Oh, Bessie Bell and Mary Grey,\r\n  They were twa bonnie lasses;\r\n  They bigged a bower on yon burn side,\r\n  And theekt it over wi\' rashes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early glory of autumn was painting the woods of Indiana--crimson,\r\norange, purple, as though a rainbow of intensified tints had been\r\nbroken into fragments, and then scattered broadcast upon the forest.\r\nBut though ripe nuts hung on many a bough, the gipsyings had not yet\r\ntaken place, except at home--when Minna, in her desperate attempts at\r\nmaking the best of things, observed, \'Now we have to make the fire\r\nourselves, let us think it is all play, and such fun.\'\r\n\r\nBut \'such fun\' was hard when one or other of the inmates of the house\r\nwas lying on the bed shaking with ague, and the others creeping wearily\r\nabout, even on their intermediate days.  They had been deluded into\r\nimprudent exposure in the lovely evenings of summer, and had never\r\nshaken off the results.\r\n\r\n\'Come, Ella,\' said Minna, one afternoon, as she descended the bare\r\nrickety stairs, \'Ave is getting better; and if we can get the fire up,\r\nand make some coffee and boil some eggs, it will be comfortable for her\r\nwhen she comes down and Henry comes in.\'\r\n\r\nElla, with a book in her hand, was curled up in a corner of a sofa\r\nstanding awry among various other articles of furniture that seemed to\r\nhave tumbled together by chance within the barn-like room.  Minna began\r\nmoving first one and then the other, daintily wiping off the dust, and\r\nrestoring an air of comfort.\r\n\r\n\'Oh dear!\' said Ella, unfolding herself; \'I am so tired.  Where\'s Hetta\r\nMary?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, don\'t you know, Hetta Mary went home this morning because Henry\r\nasked her where his boots were, and she thought he wanted her to clean\r\nthem.\'\r\n\r\n\'Can\'t Mrs. Shillabeer come in!\'\r\n\r\n\'Mrs. Shillabeer said she would never come in again, because Averil\r\nasked her not to hold the ham by the bone and cut it with her own knife\r\nwhen Henry was there!  Come, Ella it is of no use.  We had better do\r\nthings ourselves, like Cora and Ave, and then we shall not hear people\r\nsay disagreeable things.\'\r\n\r\nThe once soft, round, kitten-like Minna, whom Leonard used to roll\r\nabout on the floor, had become a lank, sallow girl, much too tall for\r\nher ten years, and with a care-stricken, thoughtful expression on her\r\nface, even more in advance of her age than was her height.  She moved\r\ninto the kitchen, a room with an iron stove, a rough table, and a few\r\nshelves, looking very desolate. The hands of both little girls had\r\nbecome expert in filling the stove with wood, and they had not far to\r\nseek before both it and the hearth in the sitting-room were\r\nreplenished, and the flame beginning to glow.\r\n\r\n\'Where\'s the coffee-mill?\' said Minna, presently, looking round in\r\nblank despair.\r\n\r\n\'Oh dear!\' said Ella, \'I remember now; that dirty little Polly Mason\r\ncame to borrow it this morning.  I said we wanted it every day: but she\r\nguessed we could do without it, for they had got a tea-party, and her\r\nlittle brother had put in a stone and spoilt Cora Muller\'s; and she\r\nsnatched it up and carried it off.\'\r\n\r\n\'He will serve ours the same, I suppose,\' said Minna.  \'It is too far\r\noff to go for it; let us make some tea.\'\r\n\r\n\'There\'s no tea,\' said Ella; \'a week ago or more that great Irene Brown\r\nwalked in and reckoned we could lend her \'ma some tea and sugar, \'cause\r\nwe had plenty.  And we have used up our own since; and if we did ask\r\nher to return the loan, hers is such nasty stuff that nobody could\r\ndrink it. What shall we do, Minna?\' and she began to cry.\r\n\r\n\'We must take some coffee up to the hotel,\' said Minna, after a\r\nmoment\'s reflection; \'Black Joe is very good-natured, and he\'ll grind\r\nit.\'\r\n\r\n\'But I don\'t like to go ail by myself,\' said Ella; \'into the kitchen\r\ntoo, and hear them say things about Britishers.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll go, dear,\' said Minna, gently, \'if you will just keep the fire\r\nup, and boil the eggs, and make the toast, and listen if Ave calls.\'\r\n\r\nPoor Minna, her sensitive little heart trembled within her at the rough\r\ncontemptuous words that the exclusive, refined tone of the family\r\nalways provoked, and bodily languor and weariness made the walk trying;\r\nbut she was thinking of Ave\'s need, and resolutely took down her cloak\r\nand hat.  But at that moment the latch was raised, and the bright\r\ngraceful figure of Cora stood among them, her feathered hat and\r\ndelicate muslin looking as fresh as at New York.\r\n\r\n\'What, all alone!\' she said; \'I know it is poor Ave\'s sick day.  Is she\r\nbetter?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, going to get up and come down; but--\' and all the troubles were\r\npoured out.\r\n\r\n\'True enough, the little wretch did spoil our mill, but Rufus mended\r\nit; and as I thought Polly had been marauding on you, I brought some\r\ndown.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah!  I thought I smelt it most deliciously as you came in, but I was\r\nafraid I only fancied it because I was thinking about it.  Dear Cora,\r\nhow good you are!\'\r\n\r\n\'And have you anything for her to eat?\'\r\n\r\n\'I was going to make some toast.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of that dry stuff!  Come, we\'ll manage something better:\' and off came\r\nthe dainty embroidered cambric sleeves, up went the coloured ones, a\r\nwhite apron came out of a pocket, and the pretty hands were busy among\r\nthe flour; the children assisting, learning, laughing a childlike laugh.\r\n\r\n\'Ah!\' cried Cora, turning round, and making a comic threatening gesture\r\nwith her floury fingers; \'you ought not to have come till we were\r\nfixed.  Go and sit in your chair by the fire.\'\r\n\r\n\'Dear Cora!\'\r\n\r\nBut Cora ran at her, and the wan trembling creature put on a smile, and\r\nwas very glad to comply; being totally unequal to resist or even to\r\nstand long enough to own her dread of Henry\'s finding all desolate and\r\nnothing to eat.\r\n\r\nPresently Cora tripped in, all besleeved and smartened, to set cushions\r\nbehind the tired back and head, and caress the long thin fingers.\r\n\'I\'ve left Minna, like King Alfred, to watch the cakes,\' she said; \'and\r\nElla is getting the cups.  So your fifth girl is gone.\'\r\n\r\n\'The fifth in five months!  And we let her sit at table, and poor dear\r\nMinna has almost worn out her life in trying to hinder her from getting\r\naffronted.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve thought what to do for you, Ave.  There\'s the Irish woman, Katty\r\nBlake--her husband has been killed.  She is rough enough, but tender in\r\nher way; and she must do something for herself and her child.\'\r\n\r\n\'Her husband killed!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, at Summerville.  I thought you had heard it.  Mordaunt wrote to\r\nme to tell her; and I shall never forget her wailing at his dying away\r\nfrom his country.  It was not lamentation for herself, but that he\r\nshould have died far away from his own people.\'\r\n\r\n\'She is not long from the old country; I should like to have her if--if\r\nwe can afford it.  For if the dividends don\'t come soon from that\r\nbuilding company, Cora, I don\'t know where to turn--\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, they must come.  Father has been writing to Rufus about the\r\narrangements.  Besides, those Irish expect less, and understand old\r\ncountry manners better, if you can put up with their breakages.\'\r\n\r\n\'I could put up with anything to please Henry, and save Minna\'s little\r\nhard-worked bones.\'\r\n\r\n\'I will send her to-morrow.  Is it not Minna\'s day of ague?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, poor dear.  That is always the day we get into trouble.\'\r\n\r\n\'I never saw a child with such an instinct for preventing variance, or\r\nso full of tact and pretty ways; yet I have seen her tremble under her\r\ncoaxing smile, that even Mis\' Shillabeer can\'t resist.\'\r\n\r\n\'See, see!\' cried Ella, hurrying in, \'surely our contingent is not\r\ncoming home!\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said Cora, hastening to the door, \'these must be a reinforcement\r\nmarching to take the train at Winiamac.\'\r\n\r\n\'Marching?\' said Ella, looking up archly at her.  \'We didn\'t let our\r\nvolunteers march in that way.\'\r\n\r\nThey were sturdy bearded backwoodsmen, rifle on shoulder, and with\r\ngrave earnest faces; but walking rather than marching, irregularly\r\nkeeping together, or straggling, as they chose.\r\n\r\n\'Your volunteers!\' cried Cora, her eyes flashing; \'theirs was toy work!\r\nThese are bound for real patriotic war!\' and she clasped her hands\r\ntogether, then waved her handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\'It is sad,\' said Averil, who had moved to the window, \'to see so many\r\nelderly faces--men who must be the prop of their families.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is because ours is a fight of men, not of children; not one of your\r\nEuropean wars of paltry ambition, but a war of principle!\' cried Cora,\r\nwith that intensity of enthusiasm that has shed so much blood in the\r\nbreak-up of the Great Republic.\r\n\r\n\'They do look as Cromwell\'s Ironsides may have done,\' said Averil; \'as\r\nfull of stern purpose.\'\r\n\r\nAnd verily Averil noted the difference.  Had a number of European\r\nsoldiers been passing so near in an equally undisciplined manner, young\r\nwomen could not have stood forth as Cora was doing, unprotected, yet\r\nperfectly safe from rudeness or remark; making ready answer to the\r\ninquiry for the nearest inn--nay, only wishing she were in her own\r\nhouse, to evince her patriotism by setting refreshment before the\r\ndefenders of her cause.  Her ardour had dragged Averil up with her a\r\nlittle way, so as to feel personally every vicissitude that befell the\r\nNorth, and to be utterly unaware of any argument in favour of the\r\nConfederates; but still Averil was, in Cora\'s words, \'too English;\' she\r\ncould not, for the life of her, feel as she did when equipping her\r\nbrother against possible French invasions, and when Mordaunt Muller had\r\nbeen enrolled in the Federal army, she had almost offended the exultant\r\nsister by condolence instead of congratulation.\r\n\r\nFive months had elapsed since the arrival of Averil in\r\nMassissauga--months of anxiety and disappointment, which had sickened\r\nHenry of plans of farming, and lessened his hopes of practice.  The\r\nsame causes that affected him at New York told in Indiana; and even if\r\nhe had been employed, the fees would have been too small to support the\r\nexpense of horses.  As to farming, labour was scarce, and could only be\r\nobtained at the cost of a considerable outlay, and, moreover, of\r\nenduring rude self-assertions that were more intolerable to Henry than\r\neven to his sisters.  The chief hope of the family lay in the\r\nspeculation in which Averil\'s means had been embarked, which gave them\r\na right to their present domicile, and to a part of the uncleared waste\r\naround them; and would, when Massissauga should begin to flourish,\r\nplace them in affluence.  The interest of the portions of the two\r\nyounger girls was all that was secure, since these were fortunately\r\nstill invested at home.  Inhabitants did not come, lots of land were\r\nnot taken; and the Mullers evidently profited more by the magnificent\r\nharvest produced by their land than by the adventure of city founding.\r\nStill, plenty and comfort reigned in their house, and Cora had imported\r\na good deal of refinement and elegance, which she could make respected\r\nwhere Averil\'s attempts were only sneered down.  Nor had sickness tried\r\nher household.  Owing partly to situation--considerably above the level\r\nof River Street--partly to the freer, more cleared and cultivated\r\nsurroundings--partly likewise to experience, and Cousin Deborah\'s\r\nmotherly watchfulness--the summer had passed without a visitation of\r\nague, though it seemed to be regarded as an adjunct of spring, as\r\ninevitable as winter frost. Averil trembled at the thought, but there\r\nwas no escape; there were absolutely no means of leaving the spot, or\r\nof finding maintenance elsewhere.  Indeed, Cora\'s constant kindness and\r\nsympathy were too precious to be parted with, even had it been possible\r\nto move.  After the boarding-house, Massissauga was a kind of home; and\r\nthe more spirits and energy failed, the more she clung to it.\r\n\r\nMr. Muller had lately left home to arrange for the sale of his corn,\r\nand had announced that he might perhaps pay a visit to his son Mordaunt\r\nin the camp at Lexington.  Cora was expecting a letter from him, and\r\nthe hope that \'Dr. Warden\' might bring one from the post-office at\r\nWiniamac had been one cause of her visit on this afternoon; for the\r\nmammoth privileges of Massissauga did not include a post-office, nor\r\nthe sight of letters more than once a week.\r\n\r\nThe table had just been covered with preparations for a meal, and the\r\nglow of the fire was beginning to brighten the twilight, when the sound\r\nof a horse\'s feet came near, and Henry rode past the window, but did\r\nnot appear for a considerable space, having of late been reduced to\r\nbecome his own groom.  But even in the noise of the hoofs, even in the\r\nwave of the hand, the girls had detected gratified excitement.\r\n\r\n\'Charleston has surrendered!  The rebels have submitted!\' cried Cora.\r\n\r\nAnd Averil\'s heart throbbed with its one desperate hope.  No!  _That_\r\nwould have brought him in at once.\r\n\r\nAfter all, both were in a state to feel it a little flat when he came\r\nin presenting a letter to Miss Muller, and announcing, \'I have had a\r\nproposal, ladies; what would you say to seeing me a surgeon to the\r\nFederal forces?--Do you bid me go, Miss Muller?\'\r\n\r\n\'I bid every one go who can be useful to my country,\' said Cora.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t look alarmed, Averil,\' said Henry, affectionately, as he met her\r\nstartled eyes; \'there is no danger.  A surgeon need never expose\r\nhimself.\'\r\n\r\n\'But how--what has made you think of it?\' asked Averil, faintly.\r\n\r\n\'A letter from Mr. Muller--a very kind letter.  He tells me that\r\nmedical men are much wanted, and that an examination by a Board is all\r\nthat is required, the remuneration is good, and it will be an\r\nintroduction that will avail me after the termination of the war, which\r\nwill end with the winter at latest.\'\r\n\r\n\'And father has accepted an office in the commissariat department!\'\r\nexclaimed Cora, from her letter.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' answered Henry; \'he tells me that, pending more progression\r\nhere, it is wiser for us both to launch into the current of public\r\nevents, and be floated upwards by the stream.\'\r\n\r\n\'Does he want you to come to him, Cora?\' was all that Averil contrived\r\nto say.\r\n\r\n\'Oh no, he will be in constant locomotion,\' said Cora.  \'I shall stay\r\nto keep house for Rufus.  And here are some directions for him that I\r\nmust carry home.  Don\'t come, Dr. Warden; I shall never cure you of\r\nthinking we cannot stir without an escort.  You will want to put a\r\nlittle public spirit into this dear Ave.  That\'s her one defect; and\r\nwhen you are one of us, she will be forced to give us her heart.\'\r\n\r\nAnd away ran the bright girl, giving her caresses to each sister as she\r\nwent.\r\n\r\nThe little ones broke out, \'O, Henry, Henry, you must not go away to\r\nthe wars!\' and Averil\'s pleading eyes spoke the same.\r\n\r\nThen Henry sat down and betook himself to argument.  It would be folly\r\nto lose the first opening to employment that had presented itself.  He\r\ngrieved indeed to leave his sisters in this desolate, unhealthy place;\r\nbut they were as essentially safe as at Stoneborough; their living\r\nalone for a few weeks, or at most months, would be far less remarkable\r\nhere than there; and he would be likely to be able to improve or to\r\nalter their present situation, whereas they were now sinking deeper and\r\nmore hopelessly into poverty every day.  Then, too, he read aloud\r\npiteous accounts of the want of medical attendance, showing that it was\r\nabsolutely a cruelty to detain such assistance from the sick and\r\nwounded.  This argument was the one most appreciated by Averil and\r\nMinna.  The rest were but questions of prudence; this touched their\r\nhearts.  Men lying in close tents, or in crowded holds of ships, with\r\nfestering wounds and fevered lips, without a hand to help them--some,\r\ntoo, whom they had seen at New York, and whose exulting departure they\r\nhad witnessed--sufferers among whom their own Cora\'s favourite brother\r\nmight at any moment be numbered--the thought brought a glow of\r\nindignation against themselves for having wished to withhold him.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, go, Henry; it is right, and you shall hear not another word of\r\nobjection,\' said Averil.\r\n\r\n\'You can write or telegraph the instant you want me.  And it will be\r\nfor a short time,\' said Henry, half repenting when the opposition had\r\ngiven way.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, we shall get on very well,\' said Minna, cheerfully; \'better,\r\nperhaps for you know we don\'t mind Far West manners; and I\'ll have\r\nlearnt to do all sorts of things as well as Cora when you come home!\'\r\n\r\nAnd Henry, after a year\'s famine of practice, was in better spirits\r\nthan since that fatal summer morning.  Averil felt how different a man\r\nis in his vocation, and deprived of it.\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes,\' she said to herself, \'if I had let ourselves be a drag on him\r\nwhen he is so much needed, I could never have had the face to write to\r\nour dear sufferer at home in his noble patience.  It is better that we\r\nshould be desolate than that he should be a wreck, or than that mass of\r\nsickness should be left untended!  And the more desolate, the more sure\r\nof One Protector.\'\r\n\r\nThere was true heroism in the spirit in which this young girl braced\r\nherself to uncomplaining acceptance of desertion in this unwholesome\r\nswamp, with her two little ailing sisters, beside the sluggish stream,\r\namid the skeleton trees--heroism the greater because there was no\r\nenthusiastic patriotism to uphold her--it was only the land of her\r\ncaptivity, whence she looked towards home like Judah to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n  Prisoner of hope thou art; look up and sing,\r\n  In hope of promised spring.\r\n                       Christian Year\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1862, Tom May was to go up for his examination at the\r\nCollege of Physicians, but only a day or two before it he made his\r\nappearance at home, in as much excitement as it was in him to betray.\r\nHazlitt, the banker\'s clerk at Whitford, had written to him tidings of\r\nthe presentation of the missing cheque for L25, which Bilson had paid\r\nto old Axworthy shortly before the murder, and which Leonard had\r\nmentioned as in the pocket-book containing his receipt for the sum that\r\nhad been found upon him.  Tom had made a halt at Whitford, and seen the\r\ncheque, which had been backed by the word Axworthy, with an initial\r\nthat, like all such signatures of the nephew, might stand either for S.\r\nor F., and the stiff office hand of both the elder and younger Axworthy\r\nwas so much alike, that no one could feel certain whose writing it was.\r\nThe long concealment, after the prisoner\'s pointed reference to it,\r\nwas, however, so remarkable, that the home conclave regarded the cause\r\nas won; and the father and son hastened triumphantly to the attorneys\'\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Bramshaw and Anderson were greatly struck, and owned that their\r\nown minds were satisfied as to the truth of their client\'s assertion;\r\nbut they demurred as to the possibility of further steps. An action for\r\nforgery, Tom\'s first hope, he saw to be clearly impossible; Samuel\r\nAxworthy appeared to have signed the cheque in his own name, and he had\r\nevery right to it as his uncle\'s heir; and though the long withholding\r\nof it, as well as his own departure, were both suspicious\r\ncircumstances, they were not evidence.  Where was there any certainty\r\nthat the cheque had ever been in the pocket-book or even if it had, how\r\ndid it prove the existence of young Ward\'s acknowledgment?  Might it\r\nnot have been in some receptacle of papers hitherto not opened?  There\r\nwas no sufficient case to carry to the police, after a conviction like\r\nLeonard\'s, to set them on tracing the cheque either to an unknown\r\nrobber, or to Sam Axworthy, its rightful owner.\r\n\r\nMr. Bramshaw likewise dissuaded Dr. May from laying the case before the\r\nSecretary of State, as importunity without due grounds would only tell\r\nagainst him if any really important discovery should be made: and the\r\nDoctor walked away, with blood boiling at people\'s coolness to other\r\nfolk\'s tribulations, and greatly annoyed with Tom for having acceded to\r\nthe representations of the men of law, and declining all co-operation\r\nin drawing up a representation for the Home Office, on the plea that he\r\nhad no time to lose in preparing for his own examination, and must\r\nreturn to town by the next train, which he did without a syllable of\r\nreal converse with any one at home.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor set to work with his home helpers, assisted by Dr. Spencer;\r\nbut the work of composition seemed to make the ground give way under\r\ntheir feet, and a few adroit remarks from Dr. Spencer finally showed\r\nhim and Ethel that they had not yet attained the prop for the lever\r\nthat was to move the world.  He gave it up, but still he did not quite\r\nforgive Tom for having been so easily convinced, and ready to be\r\ndismissed to his own affairs.\r\n\r\nHowever, Dr. May was gratified by the great credit with which his son\r\npassed his examination, and took his degree; and Sir Matthew Fleet\r\nhimself wrote in high terms of his talent, diligence, and steadiness,\r\nvolunteering hopes of being able to put him forward in town in his own\r\nline, for which Tom had always had a preference; and adding, that it\r\nwas in concurrence with his own recommendation that the young man\r\nwished to pursue his studies at Paris--he had given him introductions\r\nthat would enable him to do so to the greatest advantage, and he hoped\r\nhis father would consent.  The letter was followed up by one from Tom\r\nhimself, as usual too reasonable and authoritative to be gainsaid, with\r\nthe same representation of advantages to be derived from a course of\r\nthe Parisian hospitals.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, well! he is after old Fleet\'s own heart,\' said Dr. May, between\r\npride and mortification.  \'I should not grudge poor Fleet some one to\r\ntake interest in his old age, and I did not look to see him so warm\r\nabout anything.  He has not forgotten Calton Hill!  But the boy must\r\nhave done very well!  I say, shall we see him Sir Thomas some of these\r\ndays, Ethel, and laugh at ourselves for having wanted, to make him go\r\nround in a mill after our old fashion?\'\r\n\r\n\'You were contented to run round in your mill,\' said Ethel, fondly,\r\n\'and maybe he will too.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no, Ethel, I\'ll not have him persuaded.  Easy-going folk, too lazy\r\nfor ambition, have no right to prescribe for others.  Ambition turned\r\nsour is a very dangerous dose!  Much better let it fly off! I mean to\r\nlook out of my mill yet, and see Sir Thomas win the stakes. Only I wish\r\nhe would come and see us; tell him he shall not hear a word to bother\r\nhim about the old practice.  People have lived and died at Stoneborough\r\nwithout a May to help them, and so they will again, I suppose.\'\r\n\r\nEthel was very glad to see how her father had made up his mind to what\r\nwas perhaps the most real disappointment of his life, but she was\r\ngrieved that Tom did not respond to the invitation, and next wrote from\r\nParis.  It was one of his hurried notes, great contrasts to such\r\nelaborate performances as his recent letter.  \'Thanks, many thanks to\r\nmy father,\' he said; \'I knew you would make him see reason, and he\r\nalways yields generously.  I was too much hurried to come home; could\r\nnot afford to miss the trail.  I had not time to say before that the\r\nBank that sent the cheque to Whitford had it from a lodging-house in\r\ntown.  Landlord had a writ served on S. A.; as he was embarking at\r\nFolkestone, he took out the draft and paid.  He knew its import, if\r\nBramshaw did not.  I hope my father was not vexed at my not staying.\r\nThere are things I cannot stand, namely, discussions and Gertrude.\'\r\n\r\nGertrude was one of the chief cares upon Ethel\'s mind.  She spent many\r\nthoughts upon the child, and even talked her over with Flora.\r\n\r\n\'What is it, Flora? is it my bad management?  She is a good girl, and a\r\ndear girl; but there is such a want of softness about her.\'\r\n\r\n\'There is a want of softness about all the young ladies of the day,\'\r\nreturned Flora.\r\n\r\n\'I have heard you say so, but--\'\r\n\r\n\'We have made girls sensible and clear-headed, till they have grown\r\nhard.  They have been taught to despise little fears and illusions, and\r\nit is certainly not becoming.\'\r\n\r\n\'We had not fears, we were taught to be sensible.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, but it is in the influence of the time!  It all tends to make\r\ngirls independent.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s very well for the fine folks you meet in your visits, but it\r\ndoes not account for my Daisy--always at home, under papa\'s eye--having\r\nturned nineteenth century--What is it, Flora?  She is reverent in great\r\nthings, but not respectful except to papa, and that would not have been\r\nrespect in one of us--only he likes her sauciness.\'\r\n\r\n\'That is it, partly.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, I won\'t have that said,\' exclaimed Ethel.  \'Papa is the only\r\nsoftening influence in the house--the only one that is tender.  You see\r\nit is unlucky that Gertrude has so few that she really does love, with\r\nanything either reverend or softening about them.  She is always at war\r\nwith Charles Cheviot, and he has not fun enough, is too lumbering\r\naltogether, to understand her, or set her down in the right way; and\r\nshe domineers over Hector like the rest of us.  I did hope the babies\r\nmight have found out her heart, but, unluckily, she does not take to\r\nthem.  She is only bored by the fuss that Mary and Blanche make about\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\'You know we are all jealous of both Charles Cheviots, elder and\r\nyounger.\'\r\n\r\n\'I often question whether I should not have taken her down and made her\r\nashamed of all the quizzing and teasing at the time of Mary\'s marriage.\r\nBut one cannot be always spoiling bright merry mischief, and I am only\r\nelder sister after all.  It is a wonder she is as good to me as she is.\'\r\n\r\n\'She never remembered our mother, poor dear.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah! that is the real mischief,\' said Ethel.  \'Mamma would have given\r\nthe atmosphere of gentleness and discretion, and so would Margaret. How\r\noften I have been made, by the merest pained look, to know when what I\r\nsaid was saucy or in bad taste, and I--I can only look forbidding, or\r\nelse blurt out a reproof that _will_ not come softly.\'\r\n\r\n\'The youngest _must_ be spoilt,\' said Flora, \'that\'s an ordinance of\r\nnature.  It ends when a boy goes to school, and when a girl--\'\r\n\r\n\'When?\'\r\n\r\n\'When she marries--or when she finds out what trouble is,\' said Flora.\r\n\r\n\'Is that all you can hold out to my poor Daisy?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, it is the way of the world.  There is just now a reaction from\r\nsentiment, and it is the less feminine variety.  The softness will come\r\nwhen there is a call for it.  Never mind when the foundation is safe.\'\r\n\r\n\'If I could only see that child heartily admiring and looking up!  I\r\ndon\'t mean love--there used to be a higher, nobler reverence!\'\r\n\r\n\'Such as you and Norman used to bestow on Shakespeare and Scott,\r\nand--the vision of Cocksmoor.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not only _used_,\' said Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, it is your soft side,\' said Flora; \'it is what answers the\r\npurpose of sentiment in people like you.  It is what I should have\r\nthought living with you would have put into any girl; but Gertrude has\r\na satirical side, and she follows the age.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wish you would tell her so--it is what she especially wants not to\r\ndo!  But the spirit of opposition is not the thing to cause tenderness.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, you must wait for something to bring it out.  She is very kind to\r\nmy poor little Margaret, and I won\'t ask how she talks _of_ her.\'\r\n\r\n\'Tenderly; oh yes, that she always would do.\'\r\n\r\n\'There, then, Ethel, if she can talk tenderly of Margaret, there can\'t\r\nbe much amiss at the root.\'\r\n\r\n\'No; and you don\'t overwhelm the naughty girl with baby talk.\'\r\n\r\n\'Like our happy, proud young mothers,\' sighed Flora; and then letting\r\nherself out--\'but indeed, Ethel, Margaret is very much improved.  She\r\nhas really begun to wish to be good.  I think she is struggling with\r\nherself.\'\r\n\r\n\'Something to love tenderly, something to reverence highly.\'  So\r\nmeditated Ethel, as she watched her sunny-haired, open-faced Daisy, so\r\nunconquerably gay and joyous that she gave the impression of sunshine\r\nwithout shade.  There are stages of youth that are in themselves\r\nunpleasing, and yet that are nobody\'s fault, nay, which may have within\r\nthem seeds of strength.  Tom\'s satire had fostered Daisy\'s too\r\ncongenial spirit, and he reaped the consequence in the want of repose\r\nand sympathy that were driving him from home, and shutting him up\r\nwithin himself.  Would he ever forgive that flippant saying, which\r\nEthel had recollected with shame ever since--shame more for herself\r\nthan for the child, who probably had forgotten, long ago, her \'shaft at\r\nrandom sent\'?\r\n\r\nThen Ethel would wonder whether, after all, her discontent with\r\nGertrude\'s speeches was only from feeling older and graver, and perhaps\r\nfrom a certain resentment at finding how the course of time was wearing\r\ndown the sharp edge of compassion towards Leonard.\r\n\r\nA little more about Leonard was gathered when the time came of release\r\nfor his friend the clerk Brown.  This young man had an uncle at Paris,\r\nengaged in one of the many departments connected with steam that carry\r\nEnglishmen all over the world, and Leonard obtained permission to write\r\nto Dr. Thomas May, begging him to call upon the uncle, and try if he\r\ncould be induced to employ the penitent and reformed nephew under his\r\nown eye.  It had been wise in Leonard to write direct, for if the\r\nrequest had been made through any one at home, Tom would have\r\nconsidered it as impossible; but he could not resist the entreaty, and\r\nhis mission was successful.  The uncle was ready to be merciful, and\r\nundertook all the necessary arrangements for, and even the\r\nresponsibility of, bringing the ticket-of-leave man to Paris, where he\r\nfound him a desk in his office.  One of Tom\'s few detailed epistles was\r\nsent to Ethel after this arrival, when the uncle had told him how the\r\nnephew had spoken of his fellow-prisoner. It was to Leonard Ward that\r\nthe young man had owed the inclination to open his heart to religious\r\ninstruction, hitherto merely endured as a portion of the general\r\ninfliction of the penalty, a supposed engine for dealing with the\r\nsuperstitious, but entirely beneath his attention.  The sight of the\r\neducated face had at first attracted him, but when he observed the\r\nreverential manner in chapel, he thought it mere acting the \'\'umble\r\nprisoner,\' till he observed how unobtrusive, unconscious, and retiring\r\nwas every token of devotion, and watched the eyes, brightened or\r\nsoftened in praise or in prayer, till he owned the genuineness and\r\nguessed the depth of both, then perceived in school how far removed his\r\nunknown comrade was from the mere superstitious boor.  This was the\r\nbeginning.  The rest had been worked out by the instruction and\r\ndiscipline of the place, enforced by the example, and latterly by the\r\nconversation, of his fellow-prisoner, until he had come forth sincerely\r\nrepenting, and with the better hope for the future that his sins had\r\nnot been against full light.\r\n\r\nHe declared himself convinced that Ward far better merited to be at\r\nlarge than he did, and told of the regard that uniform good conduct was\r\nobtaining at last, though not till after considerable persecution,\r\nalmost amounting to personal danger from the worse sort of convicts,\r\nwho regarded him as a spy, because he would not connive at the\r\nintroduction of forbidden indulgences, and always stood by the\r\nauthorities.  Once his fearless interposition had saved the life of a\r\nwarder, and this had procured him trust, and promotion to a class where\r\nhis companions were better conducted, and more susceptible to good\r\ninfluences, and among them Brown was sure that his ready submission and\r\nconstant resolution to do his work were producing an effect.  As to his\r\nspirits, Brown had never known him break down but once, and that was\r\nwhen he had come upon a curious fossil in the stone.  Otherwise he was\r\ngrave and contented, but never laughed or joked as even some gentlemen\r\nprisoners of more rank and age had been known to do.  The music in the\r\nchapel was his greatest pleasure, and he had come to be regarded as an\r\nimportant element in the singing.\r\n\r\nVery grateful was Dr. May to Tom for having learnt, and still more for\r\nhaving transmitted, all these details, and Ethel was not the less\r\ntouched, because she knew they were to travel beyond Minster Street.\r\nThose words of Mr. Wilmot\'s seemed to be working out their\r\naccomplishment; and she thought so the more, when in early spring one\r\nof Leonard\'s severe throat attacks led to his being sent after his\r\nrecovery to assist the schoolmaster, instead of returning to the\r\ncarpenter\'s shed; and he was found so valuable in the school that the\r\nmaster begged to retain his services.\r\n\r\nThat spring was a grievous one in Indiana.  The war, which eighteen\r\nmonths previously was to have come to an immediate end, was still\r\nraging, and the successes that had once buoyed up the Northern States\r\nwith hope had long since been chequered by terrible reverses.  On, on,\r\nstill fought either side, as though nothing could close the strife but\r\nexhaustion or extinction; and still ardent, still constant, through\r\nbereavement and privation, were either party to their blood-stained\r\nflag.  Mordaunt Muller had fallen in one of the terrible battles on the\r\nRappahannock; and Cora, while, sobbing in Averil\'s arms, had still\r\nconfessed herself thankful that it had been a glorious death for his\r\ncountry\'s cause!  And even in her fresh grief, she had not endeavoured\r\nto withhold her other brother, when, at the urgent summons of\r\nGovernment, he too had gone forth to join the army.\r\n\r\nCora was advised to return to her friends at New York, but she declared\r\nher intention of remaining to keep house with Cousin Deborah.  Unless\r\nAveril would come with her, nothing should induce her to leave\r\nMassissauga, certainly not while Ella and Averil were alternately laid\r\nlow by the spring intermittent fever.  Perhaps the fact was that,\r\nbesides her strong affection for Averil, she felt that in her ignorance\r\nshe had assisted her father in unscrupulously involving them in a\r\nhazardous and unsuccessful speculation, and that she was the more\r\nbound, in justice as well as in love and pity, to do her best for their\r\nassistance.  At any rate, Rufus had no sooner left home, than she\r\ninsisted on the three sisters coming to relieve her loneliness--in\r\nother words, in removing them from the thin ill-built frame house,\r\ngaping in every seam with the effects of weather, and with damp oozing\r\nup between every board of the floor, the pestiferous river-fog, the\r\nclose air of the forest, and the view of the phantom trees, now\r\ndecaying and falling one against another.\r\n\r\nCousin Deborah, who had learnt to love and pity the forlorn English\r\ngirls, heartily concurred; and Averil consented, knowing that the dry\r\nhouse and pure air were the best hope of restoring Ella\'s health.\r\n\r\nAveril and Ella quickly improved, grew stronger in the intervals, and\r\nsuffered less during the attacks; but Minna, who in their own house had\r\nbeen less ill, had waited on both, and supplied the endless\r\ndeficiencies of the kindly and faithful, but two-fisted Katty; Minna,\r\nwhose wise and simple little head had never failed in sensible\r\ncounsels, or tender comfort; Minna, whom the rudest and most\r\nself-important far-wester never disobliged, Minna, the peace-maker, the\r\ncomfort and blessing--was laid low by fever, and fever that, as the\r\nexperienced eyes of Cousin Deborah at once perceived, \'meant mischief.\'\r\nThen it was that the real kindliness of heart of the rough people of\r\nthe West showed itself.  The five wild young ladies, whose successive\r\ndomestic services had been such trouble, and whose answer to a summons\r\nfrom the parlour had been, \'Did yer holler, Avy? I thort I heerd a\r\nscritch,\' each, from Cleopatra Betsy to Hetta Mary, were constantly\r\nrushing in to inquire, or to present questionable dainties and nostrums\r\nfrom their respective \'Mas\'; the charwomen, whom Minna had coaxed in\r\nher blandest manner to save trouble to Averil and disgust to Henry,\r\nwere officious in volunteers of nursing and sitting up, the black cook\r\nat the hotel sent choice fabrics of jelly and fragrant ice; and even\r\nHenry\'s rival, who had been so strong against the insolence of a\r\npractitioner showing no testimonials, no sooner came under the\r\ninfluence of the yearning, entreating, but ever-patient eyes, than his\r\nattendance became assiduous, his interest in the case ardent.\r\n\r\nHenry himself was in the camp, before Vicksburg, with his hands too\r\nfull of piteous cases of wounds and fever to attempt the most hurried\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\n\'Sister, dear,\' said the soft slow voice, one day when Averil had been\r\nhoping her patient was asleep, \'are you writing to Henry?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, my darling.  Do you want to say anything?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes! so much;\' and the eyes grew bright, and the breath gasping;\r\n\'please beg Henry--tell Henry--that I must--I can\'t bear it any longer\r\nif I don\'t--\'\r\n\r\n\'You must what, dear child?  Henry would let you do anything he could.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, then, would he let me speak about dear Leonard?\' and the child\r\ngrew deadly white when the words were spoken; but her eyes still sought\r\nAveril\'s face, and grew terrified at the sight of the gush of tears.\r\n\'O, Ave, Ave, tell me only--he is not dead!\' and as Averil could only\r\nmake a sign, \'I do have such dreadful fancies about him, and I think I\r\ncould sleep if I only knew what was really true.\'\r\n\r\n\'You shall, dear child, you shall, without waiting to hear from Henry;\r\nI know he would let you.\'\r\n\r\nAnd only then did Averil know the full misery that Henry\'s decision had\r\ninflicted on the gentle little heart, in childish ignorance, imagining\r\nfetters and dungeons, even in her sober waking moods, and a prey to\r\nuntold horrors in every dream, exaggerated by feverishness and\r\nailment--horrors that, for aught she knew, might be veritable, and made\r\nmore awful by the treatment of his name as that of one dead.\r\n\r\nTo hear of him as enjoying the open air and light of day, going to\r\nchurch, singing their own favourite hymn tunes, and often visited by\r\nDr. May, was to her almost as great a joy as if she had heard of him at\r\nliberty.  And Averil had a more than usually cheerful letter to read to\r\nher, one written in the infirmary during his recovery.  His letters to\r\nher were always cheerful, but this one was particularly so, having been\r\nwritten while exhilarated by the relaxations permitted to\r\nconvalescents, and by enjoying an unwonted amount of conversation with\r\nthe chaplain and the doctor.\r\n\r\n\'So glad, so glad,\' Minna was heard murmuring to herself again and\r\nagain; her rest was calmer than it had been for weeks, and the doctor\r\nfound her so much better that he trusted that a favourable change had\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nBut it was only a gleam of hope.  The weary fever held its prey, and\r\nmany as were the fluctuations, they always resulted in greater\r\nweakness; and the wandering mind was not always able to keep fast hold\r\nof the new comfort.  Sometimes she would piteously clasp her sister\'s\r\nhand, and entreat, \'Tell me again;\' and sometimes the haunting\r\ndelirious fancies of chains and bars would drop forth from the tongue\r\nthat had lost its self-control; yet even at the worst came the dear old\r\nrecurring note, \'God will not let them hurt him, for he has not done\r\nit!\'  Sometimes, more trying to Averil than all, she would live over\r\nagain the happy games with him, or sing their favourite hymns and\r\nchants, or she would be heard pleading, \'O, Henry, don\'t be cross to\r\nLeonard.\'\r\n\r\nCora could not fail to remark the new name that mingled in the\r\nunconscious talk; but she had learnt to respect Averil\'s reserve, and\r\nshe forbore from all questioning, trying even to warn Cousin Deborah,\r\nwho, with the experience of an elderly woman, remarked, \'That she had\r\ntoo much to do to mind what a sick child rambled about.  When Cora had\r\nlived to her age, she would know how unaccountably they talked.\'\r\n\r\nBut Averil felt the more impelled to an outpouring by this delicate\r\nforbearance, and the next time she and Cora were sent out together to\r\nbreathe the air, while Cousin Deborah watched the patient, she told the\r\nhistory, and to a sympathizing listener, without a moment\'s doubt of\r\nLeonard\'s innocence, nor that American law would have managed matters\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\'And now, Cora, you know why I told you there were bitterer sorrows\r\nthan yours.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah!  Averil, I could have believed you once; but to know that he never\r\ncan come again!  Now you always have hope.\'\r\n\r\n\'My hope has all but gone,\' said Averil.  \'There is only one thing left\r\nto look to.  If I only can live till he is sent out to a colony, then\r\nnothing shall keep me back from him!\'\r\n\r\n\'And what would I give for even such a hope?\'\r\n\r\n\'We have a better hope, both of us,\' murmured Averil.\r\n\r\n\'It won\'t seem so long when it is over.\'\r\n\r\nWell was it for Averil that this fresh link of sympathy was riveted,\r\nfor day by day she saw the little patient wasting more hopelessly away,\r\nand the fever only burning lower for want of strength to feed on.\r\nUtterly exhausted and half torpid, there was not life or power enough\r\nleft in the child for them to know whether she was aware of her\r\ncondition.  When they read Prayers, her lips always moved for the\r\nLord\'s Prayer and Doxology; and when the clergyman came out from\r\nWiniamac, prayed by her and blessed her, she opened her eyes with a\r\nlook of comprehension; and if, according to the custom from the\r\nbeginning of her illness, the Psalms and Lessons were not read in her\r\nroom, she was uneasy, though she could hardly listen.  So came Easter\r\nEve; and towards evening she was a little revived, and asked Averil\r\nwhat day it was, then answered, \'I thought it would have been nice to\r\nhave died yesterday,\'--it was the first time she mentioned death.\r\nAveril told her she was better, but half repented, as the child sank\r\ninto torpor again; and Averil, no longer the bewildered girl who had\r\nbeen so easily led from the death scene, knew the fitful breath and\r\nfluttering pulse, and felt the blank dread stealing over her heart.\r\n\r\nAgain, however, the child looked up, and murmured, \'You have not read\r\nto-day.\'  Cora, who had the Bible on her knee, gently obeyed, and read\r\non, where she was, the morning First Lesson, the same in the American\r\nChurch as in our own.  Averil, dull with watching and suffering, sat on\r\ndreamily, with the scent of primroses wafted to her, as it were, by the\r\nassociation of the words, though her power to attend to them was gone.\r\nBefore the chapter was over, the doze had overshadowed the little girl\r\nagain; and yet, more than once, as the night drew on, they heard her\r\nmuttering what seemed like the echo of one of its verses, \'Turn you,\r\nturn you--\'\r\n\r\nAt last, after hours of watching, and more than one vain endeavour of\r\ngood Cousin Deborah to lead away the worn but absorbed nurses, the\r\ndread messenger came.  Minna turned suddenly in her sister\'s arms, with\r\nmore strength than Averil had thought was left in her, and eagerly\r\nstretched out her arms, while the words so long trembling on her lips\r\nfound utterance.  \'Turn you to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope!\r\nO, Leonard dear! it does not hurt!\'  But that last word was almost lost\r\nin the gasp--the last gasp.  What \'did not hurt\' was death without his\r\nsting.\r\n\r\n\'O, Cora!  Was he with her?  Is he gone too?\' was Averil\'s cry at the\r\nfirst moment, as she strained the form of her little comforter for the\r\nlast time in her arms.\r\n\r\n\'And if he is, they are in joy together,\' said Cousin Deborah, tenderly\r\nbut firmly unloosing Averil\'s arms, though with the tears running down\r\nher cheeks.  \'Take her away, Cora, and both of you sleep.  This dear\r\nlamb is in better keeping than yours.\'\r\n\r\nHeavy, grievous, was the loss, crushing the grief; but it was such as\r\nto be at its softest and sweetest at Easter, amid the Resurrection\r\njoys, and the budding flowers, though Ella\'s bitterest fit of weeping\r\nwas excited by there being no primroses--the primroses that Minna loved\r\nso much; and her first pleasurable thought was to sit down and write to\r\nher dear \'Mr. Tom\' to send her some primrose seed, for Minna\'s grave.\r\n\r\nMinna\'s grave!  Alas! Massissauga had but an untidy desolate-looking\r\nregion, with a rude snake fence, all unconsecrated!  Cora wanted to\r\nchoose a shaded corner in her father\'s ground, where they might daily\r\ntend the child\'s earthly resting-place; but Averil shrank from this\r\nwith horror; and finally, on one of the Easter holidays, the little\r\nwasted form in its coffin was reverently driven by Philetus to\r\nWiniamac, while the sisters and Cora slowly followed, thinking--the one\r\nof the nameless blood-stained graves of a battle-field; the other\r\nwhether an equally nameless grave-yard, but one looked on with a\r\nshudder unmixed with exultation, had opened for the other being she\r\nloved best.  \'The Resurrection and the Life.--Yes, had not He made His\r\ngrave with the wicked, and been numbered with the transgressors!\'\r\n\r\nSomehow, the present sorrow was more abundant in such comforts as these\r\nthan all the pangs which her heart, grown old in sorrow, had yet\r\nendured.\r\n\r\nYet if her soul had bowed itself to meet sorrow more patiently and\r\npeacefully, it was at the expense of the bodily frame.  Already\r\nweakened by the intermittent fever, the long strain of nursing had told\r\non her; and that hysteric affection that had been so distressing at the\r\ntime of her brother\'s trial recurred, and grew on her with every\r\noccasion for self-restraint.  The suspense in which she lived--with one\r\nbrother in the camp, in daily peril from battle and disease, the other\r\nin his convict prison--wore her down, and made every passing effect of\r\nclimate or fatigue seize on her frame like a serious disorder; and the\r\nmore she resigned her spirit, the more her body gave way.  Yet she was\r\ninfinitely happier.  The repentance and submission were bearing fruit,\r\nand the ceasing to struggle had brought a strange calm and acceptance\r\nof all that might be sent; nay, her own decay was perhaps the sweetest\r\nsolace and healing of the wearied spirit; and as to Ella, she would\r\ntrust, and she did trust, that in some way or other all would be well.\r\n\r\nShe felt as if even Leonard\'s death could be accepted thankfully as the\r\ncaptive\'s release.  But that sorrow was spared her.\r\n\r\nThe account of Leonard came from Mr. Wilmot, who had carried him the\r\ntidings.  The prisoner had calmly met him with the words, \'I know what\r\nyou are come to tell me;\' and he heard all in perfect calmness and\r\nresignation, saying little, but accepting all that the clergyman said,\r\nexactly as could most be desired.\r\n\r\nFrom the chaplain, likewise, Mr. Wilmot learnt that Leonard, though\r\nstill only in the second stage of his penalty, stood morally in a very\r\ndifferent position, and was relied on as a valuable assistant in all\r\nthat was good, more effective among his fellow-prisoners than was\r\npossible to any one not in the same situation with themselves, and\r\nfully accepting that position when in contact either with convicts or\r\nofficials.  \'He has never referred to what brought him here,\' said the\r\nchaplain, \'nor would I press him to do so; but his whole tone is of\r\nrepentance, and acceptance of the penalty, without, like most of them,\r\nregarding it as expiation.  It is this that renders his example so\r\nvaluable among the men.\'\r\n\r\nAfter such a report as this, it was disappointing, on Dr. May\'s next\r\nvisit to Portland, at two months\' end, to find Leonard drooping and\r\ndowncast.  The Doctor was dismayed at his pale, dejected, stooping\r\nappearance, and the silence and indifference with which he met their\r\nordinary topics of conversation, till the Doctor began anxiously--\r\n\r\n\'You are not well?\'\r\n\r\n\'Quite well, thank you.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are looking out of condition.  Do you sleep?\'\r\n\r\n\'Some part of the night.\'\r\n\r\n\'You want more exercise.  You should apply to go back to the\r\ncarpenter\'s shop--or shall I speak to the governor?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, thank you. I believe they want me in school.\'\r\n\r\n\'And you prefer school work?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know, but it helps the master.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you think you make any progress with the men?  We heard you were\r\nvery effective with them.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t see that much can be done any way, certainly not by me.\'\r\n\r\nThen the Doctor tried to talk of Henry and the sisters; but soon saw\r\nthat Leonard had no power to dwell upon them.  The brief answers were\r\ngiven with a stern compression and contraction of face; as if the\r\nmanhood that had grown on him in these three years was no longer\r\ncapable of the softening effusion of grief; and Dr. May, with all his\r\ntenderness, felt that it must be respected, and turned the conversation.\r\n\r\n\'I have been calling at the Castle,\' he said, \'with Ernescliffe, and\r\nthe governor showed me a curious thing, a volume of Archbishop Usher,\r\nwhich had been the Duke of Lauderdale\'s study after he was taken at\r\nWorcester.  He has made a note in the fly-leaf, "I began this book at\r\nWindsor, and finished it during my imprisonment here;" and below are\r\nmottoes in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.  I can\'t construe the Hebrew. The\r\nGreek is oisteon kai elpisteon (one must bear and hope), the Latin is\r\ndurate.  Will you accept your predecessor\'s legacy?\'\r\n\r\n\'I think I read about him in an account of the island,\' said Leonard,\r\nwith a moment\'s awakened intelligence; \'was he not the L. of the Cabal,\r\nthe persecutor in "Old Mortality?"\'\r\n\r\n\'I am afraid you are right.  Prosperity must have been worse for him\r\nthan adversity.\'\r\n\r\n\'Endure\' repeated Leonard, gravely.  \'I will think of that, and what he\r\nwould mean by hope now.\'\r\n\r\nThe Doctor came home much distressed; he had been unable to penetrate\r\nthe dreary, resolute self-command that covered so much anguish; he had\r\nfailed in probing or in healing, and feared that the apathy he had\r\nwitnessed was a sign that the sustaining spring of vigour was failing\r\nin the monotonous life.  The strong endurance had been a strain that\r\nthe additional grief was rendering beyond his power; and the crushed\r\nresignation, and air of extinguished hope, together with the\r\nindications of failing health, filled the Doctor with misgivings.\r\n\r\n\'It will not last much longer,\' he said.  \'I do not mean that he is\r\nill; but to hold up in this way takes it out of a man, especially at\r\nhis age.  The first thing that lays hold of him, he will have no\r\nstrength nor will to resist, and then--Well, I did hope to live to see\r\nGod show the right.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n  We twa hae wandered o\'er the braes,\r\n    And pu\'ed the gowans fine;\r\n  I\'ve wandered many a weary foot\r\n    Sin auld lang syne.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese years had passed quietly at Stoneborough, with little change\r\nsince Mary\'s marriage.  She was the happy excellent wife that she was\r\nmade to be; and perhaps it was better for Ethel that the first\r\nseverance had been so decisive that Mary\'s attentions to her old home\r\nwere received as favours, instead of as the mere scanty relics of her\r\nformer attachment.\r\n\r\nMr. Cheviot, as the family shook down together, became less afraid of\r\nEthel, and did not think it so needful to snub her either by his\r\ndignity or jocularity; though she still knew that she was only on terms\r\nof sufferance, and had been, more than once, made to repent of\r\nunguarded observations.  He was admirable; and the school was so\r\nrapidly improving that Norman had put his father into ecstasies by\r\nproposing to send home little Dickie to begin his education there.\r\nMoreover, the one element wanting, to accomplish the town improvements,\r\nhad been supplied by a head-master on the side of progress, and Dr.\r\nSpencer\'s victory had been won at last.  There was a chance that\r\nStoneborough might yet be clean, thanks to his reiteration of plans for\r\npurification, apropos to everything.  Baths and wash-houses were\r\nadroitly carried as a monument to Prince Albert; and on the Prince of\r\nWales\'s marriage, his perseverance actually induced the committee to\r\nfinish up the drains with all the contributions that were neither eaten\r\nup nor fired away!  Never had he been more happy and triumphant; and\r\nDr. May used to accuse him of perambulating the lower streets snuffing\r\nthe deodorized air.\r\n\r\nOne autumn evening, contrary to his wont, he allowed himself to be\r\ndrawn into the May drawing-room, and there fell into one of the bright\r\nbantering talks in which the two old friends delighted, quizzing each\r\nother, and bringing up stories of their life; while Ethel and Gertrude\r\nlistened to and laughed at the traditions of a sunnier, gayer, and more\r\nreckless age than their own; and Ethel thought how insufficient are\r\nthose pictures of life that close with the fever-dream of youthful\r\npassion, and leave untold those years of the real burthen of manhood,\r\nand still more the tranquil brightness when toil has been overlived,\r\nand the setting sun gilds the clouds that are drifting away.\r\n\r\nEthel\'s first knowledge of outer life the next morning was the sound of\r\nvoices in her father\'s adjoining room, which made her call out, \'Are\r\nyou sent for, papa?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' he answered, and in an agitated tone, \'Spencer; I\'ll send word.\'\r\n\r\nShould she mention what she had two years ago heard from Tom?  There\r\nwas no time, for the next moment she heard him hurrying down-stairs,\r\nshe saw him speeding up the garden.  There was nothing for her to do\r\nbut to dress as fast as possible, and as she was finishing she heard\r\nhis tread slowly mounting, the very footfall warning her what to\r\nexpect.  She opened the door and met him.  \'Thank God,\' he said, as he\r\ntook her hand into his own, \'it has been very merciful.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is it--?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  It must have been soon after he lay down at night.  As calm as\r\nsleep.  The heart.  I am very thankful.  I had thought he would have\r\nhad much to suffer.\'\r\n\r\nAnd then it appeared that his own observations had made him sure of\r\nwhat Ethel had learnt from Tom; but as long as it was unavowed by his\r\nfriend, he had thought himself bound to ignore it, and had so dreaded\r\nthe protracted suffering, that the actual stroke was accepted as a\r\nloving dispensation.\r\n\r\nStill, as the close of a life-long friendship, the end of a daily\r\nrefreshing and sustaining intimacy, the loss was very great, and would\r\nbe increasingly felt after the first stimulus was over.  It would make\r\nTom\'s defection a daily grievance, since much detail of hospital care,\r\nand, above all, town work, his chief fatigue, would now again fall upon\r\nhim.  But this was not his present thought.  His first care was, that\r\nhis friend\'s remains should rest with those with whom his lot in life\r\nhad been cast, in the cloister of the old Grammar-school; but here Mr.\r\nCheviot looked concerned, and with reluctance, but decision, declared\r\nit to be his duty not to consent, cited the funeral of one of his\r\nscholars at the cemetery, and referred to recent sanatory measures.\r\n\r\nDr. May quickly exclaimed that he had looked into the matter, and that\r\nthe cloister did not come under the Act.\r\n\r\n\'Not technically, sir,\' said Mr. Cheviot; \'but I am equally convinced\r\nof my duty, however much I may regret it.\'  And then, with a few words\r\nabout Mary\'s presently coming up, he departed; while \'That is too bad,\'\r\nwas the general indignant outburst, even from Richard; from all but Dr.\r\nMay himself.\r\n\r\n\'He is quite right,\' he said.  \'Dear Spencer would be the first to say\r\nso.  Richard, your church is his best monument, and you\'ll not shut him\r\nout of your churchyard nor me either.\'\r\n\r\n\'Cheviot could not have meant--\' began Richard.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, he did, I understood him, and I am glad you should have had it\r\nout now,\' said Dr. May, though not without a quivering lip.  \'Your\r\nmother has _one_ by her side, and we\'ll find each other out just as\r\nwell as if we were in the cloister.  I\'ll walk over to Cocksmoor with\r\nyou, Ritchie, and mark the place.\'\r\n\r\nThus sweetly did he put aside what might have been so severe a shock;\r\nand he took extra pains to show his son-in-law his complete\r\nacquiescence both for the present and the future.  Charles Cheviot\r\nexpressed to Richard his great satisfaction in finding sentiment thus\r\nsurmounted by sense, not perceiving that it was faith and love\r\nsurmounting both.\r\n\r\nDr. Spencer\'s only surviving relation was a brother\'s son, who, on his\r\narrival, proved to be an underbred, shrewd-looking man, evidently with\r\nstrong prepossessions against the May family, whose hospitality he did\r\nnot accept, consorting chiefly with \'Bramshaw and Anderson.\' His\r\ndisposition to reverse the arrangement for burying his uncle in \'an\r\nobscure village churchyard,\' occasioned a reference to the will, drawn\r\nup two years previously.  The executors were Thomas and Etheldred May,\r\nand it was marked on the outside that they were to have the sole\r\ndirection of the funeral.  Ethel, greatly astonished, but as much\r\nbewildered as touched, was infinitely relieved that this same day had\r\nbrought a hurried note from Paris, announcing Tom\'s intention of coming\r\nto attend the funeral.  He would be able to talk to the angry and\r\nsuspicious nephew, without, like his father, betraying either\r\nindignation or disgust.\r\n\r\nAnother person was extremely anxious for Tom\'s arrival, namely, Sir\r\nMatthew Fleet, who, not a little to Dr. May\'s gratification, came to\r\nshow his respect to his old fellow-student; and arriving the evening\r\nbefore Tom, was urgent to know the probabilities of his appearance. An\r\nappointment in London was about to be vacant, so desirable in itself,\r\nand so valuable an introduction, that there was sure to be a great\r\ncompetition; but Sir Matthew was persuaded that with his own support,\r\nand an early canvass, Tom might be certain of success.  Dr. May could\r\nnot help being grateful and gratified, declaring that the boy deserved\r\nit, and that dear Spencer would have been very much pleased; and then\r\nhe told Ethel that it was wonderful to see the blessing upon Maggie\'s\r\nchildren; and went back, as usual, to his dear old Tate and Brady,\r\nwith--\r\n\r\n  \'His house the seat of wealth shall be,\r\n  An inexhausted treasury;\r\n  His justice, free from all decay,\r\n  Shall blessings to his heirs convey.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Ethel, within herself, hoped it was no disrespect to smile at his\r\nhaving so unconsciously turned away the blessing from the father\'s to\r\nthe mother\'s side.\r\n\r\nIt was his great pride and pleasure that so many of Maggie\'s children\r\nwere round him to do honour to her old friend\'s burial--three sons, and\r\nfour daughters, and three sons-in-law.  They all stood round the grave,\r\nas near as might be to the stone that Gertrude, as a child, had laid\r\nunder his care, when his silver hair had mingled with her golden locks;\r\nand with them was a concourse that evidently impressed the nephew with\r\na new idea of the estimation in which his uncle had been held.\r\n\r\nTom had travelled all night, and had arrived only just in time. Nobody\r\nwas able to say a word to him before setting off; and almost\r\nimmediately after the return, Sir Matthew Fleet seized upon him to walk\r\nup to the station with him, and, to the infinite disgust of the nephew,\r\nthe reading of the will was thus delayed until the executor came back,\r\nextremely grave and thoughtful.\r\n\r\nAfter all, Mr. Spencer had no available grievance.  His uncle\'s\r\nproperty was very little altogether, amounting scarcely to a thousand\r\npounds, but the bulk was bequeathed to the nephew; to Aubrey May was\r\nleft his watch, and a piece of plate presented to him on his leaving\r\nIndia; to Dr. May a few books; to Tom the chief of his library, his\r\npapers, notes, and instruments, and the manuscript of a work upon\r\ndiseases connected with climate, on which he had been engaged for many\r\nyears, but had never succeeded in polishing to his own fastidious\r\nsatisfaction, or in coming to the end of new discoveries. To Etheldred,\r\nhis only legacy was his writing-desk, with all its contents.  And Mr.\r\nSpencer looked so suspicious of those contents, that Tom made her open\r\nit before him, and show that they were nothing but letters.\r\n\r\nIt had been a morning of the mixture of feelings and restless bustle,\r\nso apt to take place where the affection is not explained by\r\nrelationship; and when the strangers were gone, and the family were\r\nonce again alone, there was a drawing of freer breath, and the Doctor\r\nthrew himself back in his chair, and indulged in a long, heavy sigh,\r\nwith a weary sound in it.\r\n\r\n\'Can I go anywhere for you, father?\' said Tom, turning to him with a\r\nkind and respectful manner.\r\n\r\n\'Oh no--no, thank you,\' he said, rousing himself, and laying his hand\r\non the bell, \'I must go over to Overfield; but I shall be glad of the\r\ndrive.  Well, Dr. Tom, what did you say to Fleet\'s proposal?\'\r\n\r\n\'I said I would come up to town and settle about it when I had got\r\nthrough this executor business.\'\r\n\r\n\'You always were a lucky fellow, Tom,\' said Dr. May, trying to be\r\ninterested and sympathetic.  \'You would not wish for anything better.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know, I have not had time to think about it yet,\' said Tom,\r\npulling off his spectacles and pushing back his hair, with an action of\r\nsadness and fatigue.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! it was not the best of times to choose for the communication; but\r\nit was kindly meant.  I never expected to see Fleet take so much\r\ntrouble for any one.  But you are done up, Tom, with your night\r\njourney.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not at all,\' he answered, briskly, \'if I can do anything for you.\r\nCould not I go down to the hospital?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, if I were not to be back till five,\' began Dr. May, considering,\r\nand calling him into the hall to receive directions, from which he came\r\nback, saying, \'There! now then, Ethel, we had better look over things,\r\nand get them in train.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are so tired, Tom.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not too much for that,\' he said.  But it was a vain boast; he was too\r\nmuch fatigued to turn his mind to business requiring thought, though\r\ncapable of slow, languid reading and sorting of papers.\r\n\r\nAubrey\'s legacy was discovered with much difficulty.  In fact, it had\r\nnever been heard of, nor seen the light, since its presentation, and\r\nwas at last found in a lumber closet, in a strong box, in Indian\r\npacking.  It was a compromise between an epergne and a candelabrum,\r\ngrowing out of the howdah of an unfortunate elephant, pinning one tiger\r\nto the ground, and with another hanging on behind, in the midst of a\r\njungle of palm-trees and cobras; and beneath was an elaborate\r\ninscription, so laudatory of Aubrey Spencer, M. D., that nobody\r\nwondered he had never unpacked it, and that it was yellow with\r\ntarnish--the only marvel was, that he had never disposed of it; but\r\nthat it was likely to wait for the days when Aubrey might be a general\r\nand own a side-board.\r\n\r\nThe other bequests were far more appreciated.  Tom had known of the\r\nbook in hand, was certain of its value to the faculty, and was much\r\ngratified by the charge of it, both as a matter of feeling and of\r\ninterest.  But while he looked over and sorted the mass of curious\r\nnotes, his attention was far more set on the desk, that reverently,\r\nalmost timidly, Ethel examined, well knowing why she had been selected\r\nas the depositary of these relics.  There they were, some embrowned by\r\na burn in the corner, as though there had been an attempt to destroy\r\nthem, in which there had been no heart to persevere.  It was but\r\nlittle, after all, two formal notes in which Professor Norman Mackenzie\r\nasked the honour of Mr. Spencer\'s company to dinner, but in handwriting\r\nthat was none of the professor\'s--writing better known to Ethel than to\r\nTom--and a series of their father\'s letters, from their first\r\nseparation till the traveller\'s own silence had caused their\r\ncorrespondence to drop.  Charming letters they were, such as people\r\nwrote before the penny-post had spoilt the epistolary art--long,\r\nminute, and overflowing with brilliant happiness.  Several of them were\r\nurgent invitations to Stoneborough, and one of these was finished in\r\nthat other hand--the delicate, well-rounded writing that would not be\r\ninherited--entreating Dr. Spencer to give a few days to Stoneborough,\r\n\'it would be such a pleasure to Richard to show him the children.\'\r\n\r\nEthel did not feel sure whether to see these would give pain or\r\npleasure to her father.  He would certainly be grieved to see how much\r\nsuffering he must have inflicted in the innocence of his heart, and in\r\nthe glory of his happiness; and Tom, with a sort of shudder, advised\r\nher to keep them to herself, he was sure they would give nothing but\r\npain.\r\n\r\nShe had no choice just then, for it was a time of unusual occupation,\r\nand the difference made by their loss told immediately--the more,\r\nperhaps, because it was the beginning of November, and there was much\r\nmunicipal business to be attended to.\r\n\r\nHowever it might be for the future, during the ensuing week Dr. May\r\nnever came in for a meal with the rest of the family; was too much\r\nfagged for anything but sleep when he came home at night; and on the\r\nSunday morning, when they all had reckoned on going to Cocksmoor\r\ntogether, he was obliged to give it up, and only come into the Minster\r\nat the end of the prayers.  Every one knew that he was not a good\r\nmanager of his time, and this made things worse; and he declared that\r\nhe should make arrangements for being less taken up; but it was sad to\r\nsee him overburthened, and Tom, as only a casual visitor, could do\r\nlittle to lessen his toil, though that little was done readily and\r\nattentively.  There were no rubs between the two, and scarcely any\r\nconversation.  Tom would not discuss his prospects; and it was not\r\nclear whether he meant to avail himself of Sir Matthew\'s patronage; he\r\ncommitted himself to nothing but his wish that it were possible to stay\r\nin Paris; and he avoided even talking to his sister.\r\n\r\nNot till a week after he had left home for London came a letter\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Dear Ethel,\r\n\r\n\'I have told Fleet that I am convinced of my only right course.  I\r\ncould never get the book finished properly if I got into his line, and\r\nI must have peaceable evenings for it at home.  I suppose my father\r\nwould not like to let Dr. Spencer\'s house.  If I might have it, and\r\nkeep my own hours and habits, I think it would conduce to our working\r\nbetter together.  I am afraid I kept you in needless distress about\r\nhim, but I wanted to judge for myself of the necessity, and to think\r\nover the resignation of that quest.  I must commit it to Brown. I hope\r\nit is not too great a risk; but it can\'t be helped.  It is a matter of\r\ncourse that I should come home now the helper is gone; I always knew it\r\nwould come to that.  Manage it as quietly as you can. I must go to\r\nParis for a fortnight, to bring home my things, and by that time my\r\nfather had better get me appointed to the hospital.\r\n\r\n\'Yours ever,\r\n  \'TH. MAY.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nEthel was not so much surprised as her father, who thought she must\r\nhave been working upon Tom\'s feelings; but this she disavowed, except\r\nthat it had been impossible not to growl at patients sending at\r\nunreasonable hours.  Then he hoped that Fleet had not been\r\ndisappointing the lad; but this notion was nullified by a remonstrance\r\nfrom the knight, on the impolicy of burying such talents for the sake\r\nof present help; and even proposing to send a promising young man in\r\nTom\'s stead.  \'Not too good for poor Stoneborough,\' said Dr. May,\r\nsmiling.  \'No, no, I\'m not so decrepit as that, whatever he and Tom may\r\nhave thought me; I fancy I could tire out both of them. I can\'t have\r\nthe poor boy giving up all his prospects for my sake, Ethel.  I never\r\nlooked for it, and I shall write and tell him so! Mind, Ethel, I shall\r\nwrite, not you!  I know you would only stroke him down, and bring him\r\nhome to regret it.  No, no, I won\'t always be treated like Karl, in\r\n"Debit and Credit", who the old giant thought could neither write nor\r\nbe written to, because his finger was off.\'\r\n\r\nAnd Dr. May\'s letter was the first which this son had ever had from him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\'My Dear Tom,\r\n\r\n\'I feel your kind intentions to the heart; it is like all the rest of\r\nyour dear mother\'s children; but the young ought not to be sacrificed\r\nto the old, and I won\'t have it done.  The whole tone of practice has\r\naltered since my time, and I do not want to bind you down to the\r\nroutine.  I had left off thinking of it since I knew of your distaste.\r\nI have some years of work in me yet, that will see out most of my old\r\npatients; and for the rest, Wright is a great advance on poor Ward, and\r\nI will leave more to him as I grow older.  I mean to see you a great\r\nman yet, and I think you will be the greater and happier for the\r\nsacrifice you have been willing to make.  His blessing on you.\r\n\r\n\'Your loving father,\r\n  \'R. M.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was Tom\'s answer, but one of his cool \'good letters,\' a\r\ndemonstration that he was actuated by the calmest motives of\r\nconvenience and self-interest, in preferring the certainties of\r\nStoneborough to the contingencies of London, and that he only wanted\r\ntime for study and the completion of Dr. Spencer\'s book, enforcing his\r\nrequest for the house.\r\n\r\nHis resolution was, as usual, too evident to be combated, and it was\r\nalso plain that he chose to keep on the mask of prudent selfishness,\r\nwhich he wore so naturally that it was hard to give him credit for any\r\nother features; but this time Dr. May was not deceived.  He fully\r\nestimated the sacrifice, and would have prevented it if he could; but\r\nhe never questioned the sincerity of the motive, as it was not upon the\r\nsurface; and the token of dutiful affection, as coming from the least\r\nlikely quarter of his family, touched and comforted him.  He dwelt on\r\nit with increasing satisfaction, and answered all hurries and worries\r\nwith, \'I shall have time when Tome is come;\' re-opened old schemes that\r\nhad died away when he feared to have no successor, and now and then\r\nshowed a certain comical dread of being drilled into conformity with\r\nTom\'s orderly habits.\r\n\r\nThere was less danger of their clashing, as the son had outgrown the\r\npresumptions of early youth, and a change had passed over his nature\r\nwhich Ethel had felt, rather than seen, during his fleeting visits at\r\nhome, more marked by negatives than positives, and untraced by\r\nconfidences.  The bitterness and self-assertion had ceased to tinge his\r\nwords, the uncomfortable doubt that they were underlaid by satire had\r\npassed away, and methodical and self-possessed as he always was, the\r\natmosphere of \'number one\' was no longer apparent round all his doings.\r\nHe could be out of spirits and reserved without being either\r\nill-tempered or ironical; and Ethel, with this as the upshot of her\r\nweek\'s observations, was reassured as to the hopes of the father and\r\nson working together without collisions.  As soon as the die was cast,\r\nand there was no danger of undue persuasion in \'stroking him down,\' she\r\nindulged herself by a warmly-grateful letter, and after she had sent\r\nit, was tormented by the fear that it would be a great offence.  The\r\nanswer was much longer than she had dared to expect, and alarmed her\r\nlest it should be one of his careful ways of making the worst of\r\nhimself; but there was a large \'Private,\' scored in almost menacing\r\nletters on the top of the first sheet, and so much blotted in the\r\nfolding, that it was plain that he had taken alarm at the unreserve of\r\nhis own letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\'My Dear Ethel,\r\n\r\n\'I have been to Portland.  Really my father ought to make a stir and\r\nget Ward\'s health attended to; he looks very much altered, but will not\r\nown to anything being amiss.  They say he has been depressed ever since\r\nhe heard of Minna\'s death.  I should say he ought to be doing\r\nout-of-doors work--perhaps at Gibraltar, but then he would be out of\r\nour reach.  I could not get much from him, but that patient, contented\r\nlook is almost more than one can bear.  It laid hold of me when I saw\r\nhim the first time, and has haunted me ever since.  Verily I believe it\r\nis what is bringing me home!  You need not thank me, for it is sober\r\ncalculation that convinces me that no success on earth would compensate\r\nfor the perpetual sense that my father was wearing himself out, and you\r\npining over the sight.  Except just at first, I always meant to come\r\nand see how the land lay before pledging myself to anything; and\r\nnothing can be clearer than that, in the state of things my father has\r\nallowed to spring up, he must have help.  I am glad you have got me the\r\nold house, for I can be at peace there till I have learnt to stand his\r\nunmethodical ways.  Don\'t let him expect too much of me, as I see he is\r\ngoing to do.  It is not in me to be like Norman or Harry, and he must\r\nnot look for it, least of all now. If you did not understand, and know\r\nwhen to hold your tongue, I do not think I could come home at all; as\r\nit is, you are all the comfort I look for.  I cross to Paris to-morrow.\r\nThat is a page I am very sorry to close.  I had a confidence that I\r\nshould have hunted down that fellow, and the sight of Portland and the\r\naccounts from Massissauga alike make one long to have one\'s hands on\r\nhis throat; but that hope is ended now, and to loiter about Paris in\r\nsearch of him, when it it a plain duty to come away, would be one of\r\nthe presumptuous acts that come to no good.  Let them discuss what they\r\nwill, there\'s nothing so hard to believe in as Divine Justice!  And yet\r\nthat uncomplaining face accepts it!  You need say nothing about this\r\nletter.  I will talk about Leonard with my father when I get home.\r\n\r\n\'Ever yours,\r\n  \'Thomas May.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n  But soon as once the genial plain\r\n  Has drunk the life-blood of the slain,\r\n  Indelible the spots remain;\r\n    And aye for vengeance call,\r\n  Till racking pangs of piercing pain\r\n    Upon the guilty fall.\r\n                   AEschylus. (Translated by Professor Anstice.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Tom May\'s arrival at home was eagerly anticipated there, it was with\r\na heavy heart that he prepared for what he had never ceased to look on\r\nas a treadmill life.  He had enjoyed Paris, both from the society and\r\nthe abstract study, since he still retained that taste for theory\r\nrather than practice, which made him prefer diseases to sick people,\r\nand all sick people to those of Stoneborough.  The student life, in the\r\nfreedom of a foreign capital, was, even while devoid of license and\r\nirregularity, much pleasanter than what he foresaw at home, even though\r\nhe had obtained a separate establishment.  His residence at Paris, with\r\nthe vague hope it afforded, cost him more in the resignation than his\r\nprospects in London.  It was the week when he would have been\r\ncanvassing for the appointment, and he was glad to linger abroad out of\r\nreach of Sir Matthew\'s remonstrances, and his father\'s compunction,\r\nwhile he was engaged in arranging for a French translation of Dr.\r\nSpencer\'s book, and likewise in watching an interesting case, esteemed\r\na great medical curiosity, at the Hotel Dieu.\r\n\r\nHe was waiting in the lecture-room, when one of the house surgeons came\r\nin, saying, \'Ah! I am glad to see you here.  A compatriot of yours has\r\nbeen brought in, mortally injured in a gambling fray.  You may perhaps\r\nassist in getting him identified.\'\r\n\r\nTom followed him to the accident ward, and beheld a senseless figure,\r\nwith bloated and discoloured features, distorted by the effects of the\r\ninjury, a blow upon the temple, which had caused a fall backwards on\r\nthe sharp edge of a stove, occasioning fatal injury to the spine.\r\nAlbeit well accustomed to gaze critically upon the tokens of mortal\r\nagony, Tom felt an unusual shudder of horror and repugnance as he\r\nglanced on the countenance, so disfigured and contorted that there was\r\nno chance of recognition, and turned his attention to the clothes,\r\nwhich lay in a heap on the floor.  The contents of the pockets had been\r\ntaken out, and consisted only of some pawnbroker\'s duplicates, a\r\ncigar-case, and a memorandum-book, which last he took in his hand, and\r\nbegan to unfasten, without looking at it, while he took part in the\r\nconversation of the surgeons on the technical nature of the injuries.\r\nThus he stood for some seconds, before, on the house surgeon asking if\r\nhe had found any address, he cast his eyes on the pages which lay open\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\n\'Ha!  What have you found?--He does not hear!  Is it the portrait of\r\nthe beloved object?  Is it a brother--an enemy--or a debt?  But he is\r\ntruly transfixed!  It is an effect of the Gorgon\'s head!\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\'July 15th, 1860.  Received L120.\r\n                              \'L. A. WARD.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nThere stood Tom May, like one petrified, deaf to the words around, his\r\ndazzled eyes fixed on the letters, his faculties concentrated in the\r\nendeavour to ascertain whether they were sight or imagination. Yes,\r\nthere they were, the very words in the well-known writing, the\r\nschool-boy\'s forming into the clerk\'s, there was the blot in the top of\r\nthe L!  Tom\'s heart gave one wild bound, then all sensation, except the\r\nsight of the writing, ceased, the exclamations of those around him came\r\nsurging gradually on his ear, as if from a distance, and he did not yet\r\nhear them distinctly when he replied alertly, almost lightly, \'Here is\r\na name that surprises me.  Let me look at the patient again.\'\r\n\r\n\'No dear friend?\' asked his chief intimate, in a tone ready to become\r\ngaiety or sympathy.\r\n\r\n\'No, indeed,\' said Tom, shuddering as he stood over the insensible\r\nwretch, and perceived what it had been which had thrilled him with such\r\nunwonted horror, for, fixed by the paralyzing convulsion of the fatal\r\nblow, he saw the scowl and grin of deadly malevolence that had been the\r\nterror of his childhood, and that had fascinated his eyes at the moment\r\nof Leonard\'s sentence.  Changed by debauchery, defaced by violence,\r\ncontorted by the injured brain, the features would scarcely have been\r\nrecalled to him but for the frightful expression stamped on his memory\r\nby the miseries of his timid boyhood.\r\n\r\n\'Whoso sheddeth man\'s blood, by man shall his blood be shed.\'  The\r\nawful thought, answering his own struggle for faith in Divine Justice,\r\ncrossed him, as he heard the injury on the head defined, in almost the\r\nsame scientific terms that had so often rung on his ears as the causes\r\nof Francis Axworthy\'s death; but this was no society where he could\r\ngive vent to his feelings, and mastering himself with difficulty he\r\nanswered,  \'I know Him.  He is from my own town.\'\r\n\r\n\'Has he friends or relations?\'\r\n\r\n\'Relations, yes,\' said Tom, hardly able to restrain a trembling of the\r\nlip, half horror, half irony.  \'None here, none near.  They shall know.\'\r\n\r\n\'And means?\'\r\n\r\n\'Once he had.  Probably none now.\'\r\n\r\nTo Tom\'s great relief, a new case drew off general attention.  There\r\nonly remained the surgeon who had called him at first, and with whom he\r\nwas particularly intimate.\r\n\r\n\'Gaspard,\' he said, \'shall you have charge of this case?\'\r\n\r\n\'Brief charge it will be, apparently!  I will volunteer to watch it, if\r\nit is your desire!  Is it friendship, or enmity, or simple humanity?\'\r\n\r\n\'All!\' said Tom, hastily.  \'It is the clearing up of a horrible\r\nmystery--freedom for an innocent prisoner--I must tell you the rest at\r\nleisure.  There is much to be done now in case of his reviving.\'\r\n\r\nThis was remotely possible, but very doubtful; and Tom impressed on\r\nboth Gaspard and the nursing sister the most stringent entreaties to\r\nsummon him on the first symptom.  He then gave the name of the unhappy\r\nman, and, though unwilling to separate himself from that invaluable\r\npocket-book, perceived the necessity of leaving it as a deposit with\r\nthe authorities of the hospital, after he had fully examined it,\r\nrecognizing Leonard\'s description in each particular, the cipher F. A.\r\non the tarnished silver clasp, the shagreen cover, and the receipt on a\r\npage a little past the middle.  On the other half of the leaf was the\r\nentry of some sums due to the house; and it contained other papers\r\nwhich the guilty wretch had been evidently eager to secure, yet afraid\r\nto employ, and that, no doubt, were the cause that, like so many other\r\nmurderers on record, he had preserved that which was the most fatal\r\nproof against himself.  Or could it be with some notion of future\r\nrelenting, that he had refrained from its destruction?\r\n\r\nWith brain still seeming to reel at the discovery, and limbs actually\r\ntrembling with the shock, Tom managed to preserve sufficient coolness\r\nand discretion to bring back to mind the measures he had so often\r\nplanned for any such contingency.  Calling a cabriolet, he repaired to\r\nthe police-station nearest to the scene of the contest, and there\r\nlearnt that Axworthy had long been watched as a dangerous subject, full\r\nof turbulence, and with no visible means of maintenance.  The officials\r\nhad taken charge of the few personal effects in his miserable lodgings,\r\nand were endeavouring to secure the person who had struck the fatal\r\nblow.\r\n\r\nHis next measure was to go to the British Embassy, where, through his\r\nsister Flora\'s introductions, and his own Eton connections, he was\r\nalready well known; and telling his story there, without any attempt to\r\nconceal his breathless agitation, he had no difficulty in bringing with\r\nhim a companion who would authenticate the discovery of the receipt,\r\nand certify to any confession that might be obtained.\r\n\r\nA confession!  That was the one matter of the most intense interest.\r\nTom considered whether to secure the presence of a clergyman, but\r\nsuspected that this would put Axworthy on his guard rather than soften\r\nhim, and therefore only wrote to the chaplain, begging him to hold\r\nhimself in readiness for a summons to the Hotel Dieu, whither he drove\r\nrapidly back with his diplomatic friend, whom he wrought up well-nigh\r\nto his own pitch of expectation.  He had already decided on his own\r\nfirst address--pitying, but manifesting that nothing, not even\r\nvengeance, could be gained by concealment; and then, according to the\r\neffect, would he try either softening or threatening to extort the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nGaspard was eagerly awaiting them.  \'I had already sent for you,\' he\r\nsaid.  \'The agony is commencing; he has spoken, but he has not his full\r\nconsciousness.\'\r\n\r\nTom hurried on, drawing after him the young diplomate, who would have\r\nhung back, questioning if there were any use in his witnessing the\r\ndying struggles of a delirious man.\r\n\r\n\'Come, come,\' peremptorily repeated Tom, \'there must be some last\r\nwords.  Every moment is of importance.\'\r\n\r\nYet his trust was shaken by the perception of the progress that death\r\nhad made in the miserable frame during his absence.  The fixed\r\nexpression of malignity had been forced to yield to exhaustion and\r\nanguish, the lips moved, but the murmurs between the moans were\r\nscarcely articulate.\r\n\r\n\'He is almost past it,\' said Tom, \'but there is the one chance that he\r\nmay be roused by my voice.\'\r\n\r\nAnd having placed his friend conveniently, both for listening and\r\nmaking notes, he came close to the bed, and spoke in a tone of\r\ncompassion. \'Axworthy, I say, Axworthy, is there anything I can do for\r\nyou?\'\r\n\r\nThere was a motion of the lid of the fast-glazing eye; but the terrible\r\nface of hatred came back, with the audible words, \'I tell you, you old\r\nfool, none of the Mays are to come prying about my place.\'\r\n\r\nAppalled by the deadly malice of the imprecation and the look that\r\naccompanied this partial recognition of his voice, Tom was nerving\r\nhimself to speak again, when the dying man, as if roused by the echo of\r\nhis own thought, burst out, \'Who?  What is it?  I say Dr. May shall not\r\nbe called in!  He never attended the old man!  Let him mind his own\r\nbusiness!  I was all night at the Three Goblets.  Yes, I was! The new\r\ndarling will catch it--going off with the money upon him--\' and the\r\nlaugh made their blood run cold.  \'I\'ve got the receipt;\' and he made\r\nan attempt at thrusting his hand under the pillow, but failing, swore,\r\nshouted, howled with his last strength, that he had been robbed--the\r\npocket-book--it would hang him! and with one of the most fearful\r\nshrieks of despair that had perhaps ever rung through that asylum of\r\npain, woe, and death, the wretched spirit departed.\r\n\r\nTom May turned aside, made a few steps, and, to the infinite surprise\r\nof every one, fell helplessly down in a swoon.  A nature of deep and\r\nreal sensibility, though repressed by external reserve and prudence,\r\ncould not with entire impunity undergo such a scene.  The sudden\r\ndiscovery, the vehement excitement forced down, the intense strain of\r\nexpectation, and finally, the closing horror of such a death, betraying\r\nthe crime without repenting of it, passing to the other world with\r\nimprecations on the lips, and hatred in the glare of the eye, all the\r\nfrightfulness enhanced by the familiarity of the allusions, and the\r\nghastly association of the tones that had tempted and tyrannized over\r\nhis childhood, altogether crushed and annihilated his faculties, mental\r\nand bodily.\r\n\r\nOh, when our very hearts burn for justice, how little do we know how\r\nintolerable would be the sight of it!  Tom\'s caution and readiness\r\nreturned as soon as--after a somewhat long interval--he began to\r\ndistinguish the voices round him, and perceive the amazement he had\r\ncreated.  Before he was able to sit up on the couch, where he had been\r\nlaid out of sight of the scene which had affected him so strongly, he\r\nwas urging his friend to set down all that had been spoken, and on\r\nGaspard\'s writing a separate deposition.  The pocket-book, and other\r\neffects, were readily ceded to the British authority, and were carried\r\naway with them.\r\n\r\nHow Tom got through the remaining hours of the day and the night he\r\nnever recollected, though he knew it must have been in the bustle of\r\npreparation, and that he had imparted the tidings to Leonard\'s friend\r\nBrown, for when he and his friend had attended that which answered to\r\nan inquest on the body, and had obtained a report of the proceedings,\r\nhe was ready to start by the night train, bearing with him the\r\nattestations of the death-bed scene at the Hotel Dieu, and the\r\nlong-lost memorandum-book, and was assured that the next mail would\r\ncarry an official letter to the Home Office, detailing the\r\ncircumstances of Samuel Axworthy\'s decease.  Brown came to bid him\r\nfarewell, full of gladness and warm congratulation, which he longed to\r\nsend to his friend, but which Tom only received with hasty,\r\nhalf-comprehending assents.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon he reached Stoneborough, found no one come in,\r\nand sat down in the fire-light, where, for all his impatience, fatigue\r\nhad made him drop asleep, when he was roused by Gertrude\'s voice,\r\nexclaiming, \'Here really is Tom come, as you said he would, without\r\nwriting.  Here are all his goods in the hall.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is it you, Tom!\' cried Ethel.  \'Notice or no notice, we are glad of\r\nyou.  But what is the matter?\'\r\n\r\n\'Where\'s my father?\'\r\n\r\n\'Coming.  Charles Cheviot took him down to look at one of the boys. Is\r\nthere anything the matter?\' she added, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\'No, nothing.\'\r\n\r\n\'You look very odd,\' added Gertrude.\r\n\r\nHe gave a nervous laugh.  \'You would look odd, if you had travelled all\r\nnight.\'\r\n\r\nThey commented, and began to tell home news; but Ethel noted that he\r\nneither spoke nor heard, only listened for his father.  Gertrude grew\r\ntired of inattentive answers, and said she should go and dress. Ethel\r\nwas turning to follow, when he caught hold of her cloak, and drew her\r\nclose to him.  \'Ethel,\' he said, in a husky, stifled voice, \'do you\r\nknow this?\'\r\n\r\nOn her knees, by the red fire-light, she saw the \'L. A. Ward,\' and\r\nlooked up.  \'Is it?\' she said.  He bowed his head.\r\n\r\nAnd then Ethel put her arm round his neck, as he knelt down by her; and\r\nhe found that her tears, her rare tears, were streaming down, silent\r\nbut irrepressible.  She had not spoken, had asked no question, made no\r\nremark, when Dr. Mays entrance was heard, and she loosed her hold on\r\nher brother, out without rising from the floor, looked up from under\r\nthe shade of her hat, and said, \'O, papa! it is found, and he has done\r\nit!  Look there!\'\r\n\r\nHer choked voice, and tokens of emotion, startled the Doctor; but Tom,\r\nin a matter-of-fact tone, took up the word: \'How are you, father?--Yes.\r\nI have only met with this little memorandum.\'\r\n\r\nDr. May recognized it with a burst of incoherent inquiry and\r\nexclamation, wringing Tom\'s hand, and giving no time for an answer;\r\nand, indeed, his son attempted none--till, calming himself, the Doctor\r\nsubsided into his arm-chair, and with a deep sigh, exclaimed, \'Now\r\nthen, Tom, let us hear.  Where does this come from?\'\r\n\r\n\'From the casualty ward at the Hotel Dieu.\'\r\n\r\n\'And from--\'\r\n\r\n\'He is dead,\' said Tom, answering the unspoken question.  \'You will\r\nfind it all here.  Ethel, do I sleep here to-night?  My old room?\' As\r\nhe spoke, he bent to light a spill at the fire, and then the two\r\ncandles on the side-table; but his hand shook nervously, and though he\r\nturned away his face, his father and sister saw the paleness of his\r\ncheek, and knew that he must have received a great shock. Neither\r\nspoke, while he put one candle conveniently for his father, took up the\r\nother, and went away with it.  With one inquisitive glance at each\r\nother, they turned to the papers, and with eager eyes devoured the\r\nwritten narratives of Tom himself and of the attache, then, with no\r\nless avidity, the French reports accompanying them. Hardly a word was\r\nspoken while Ethel leant against her father\'s knee, and he almost\r\nsinged his hair in the candle, as they helped one another out in the\r\ndifficulties of the crooked foreign writing.\r\n\r\n\'Will it be enough?\' asked Ethel, at last, holding her breath for the\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\'If there is justice in England!\' said Dr. May.  \'Heaven forgive me,\r\nEthel, this business has tried my trust more than anything that ever\r\nbefell me; but it will all be right now, and righter than right, if\r\nthat boy comes out what I think him.\'\r\n\r\n\'And oh, how soon?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not a moment longer than can be helped.  I\'d go up by the mail train\r\nthis very night if it would do any good.\'\r\n\r\nTom, who reappeared as soon as he had spared himself the necessity of\r\nthe narration, was willing and eager to set out; but Dr. May, who by\r\nthis time had gathered some idea of what he had gone through, and saw\r\nthat he was restless, nervous, and unhinged, began to reconsider the\r\nexpedience of another night journey, and was, for once in his life, the\r\nperson cool enough to see that it would be wisest to call Bramshaw into\r\ntheir counsels, and only that night to send up a note mentioning that\r\nthey would do themselves the honour of calling at the Home Office the\r\nnext day, on matters connected with the intelligence received that\r\nmorning from the British Embassy at Paris.\r\n\r\nTom was disappointed; he was in no mood for sitting still, and far less\r\nfor talking.  As a matter of business, he would elucidate any question,\r\nbut conversation on what he had witnessed was impossible to him; and\r\nwhen Gertrude, with a girl\'s lightness, lamented over being balked of a\r\nconfession and explanation, he gravely answered, that she did not know\r\nwhat she was talking of; and his father led away from the subject.\r\nIndeed, Dr. May was full of kindness and consideration, being evidently\r\nnot only grateful for the discovery, but touched by his entire absence\r\nof exulting triumph, and his strong sense of awe in the retribution.\r\n\r\nThat changed and awe-struck manner impressed both the sisters, so that\r\nall the evening Ethel felt subdued as by a strange shock, and even\r\nthrough the night and morning could hardly realize that it was intense\r\nrelief--joy, not sorrow--that made her feel so unlike herself, and that\r\nthe burthen was taken away from her heart.  Even then, there was a\r\ntrembling of anxiety.  The prisoner might be set free; but who could\r\ngive back to him the sister who had pined away in exile, or the three\r\nyears of his youthful brightness?  There might be better things in\r\nstore; but she knew she must not look again for the boy of ingenuous\r\ncountenance, whose chivalrous devotion to herself had had such a charm,\r\neven while she tried to prize it at its lightest worth.  It was foolish\r\nto recollect it with a pang, but there was no helping it.  In the great\r\ntragedy, she had forgotten that the pretty comedy was over, but she\r\nregretted it, rather as she did the pleasant baby-days of Aubrey and\r\nGertrude.\r\n\r\nIndeed, during the day of suspense, while the two physicians were gone\r\nto London, taking with them the papers, and a minute detail of the\r\nevidence at the trial, Gertrude\'s high spirits, triumph over Charles\r\nCheviot, and desire to trumpet forth the good news, were oppressive.\r\nHow many times that day was Mab stroked, and assured that her master\r\nwould come back!  And how often did the two sisters endeavour to\r\npersuade themselves that she was not grown broader in the back!  Mary\r\nwas, of course, told early in the day, but Gertrude got less sympathy\r\nfrom her than answered to that damsel\'s extortionate expectations, for,\r\naccording to her wicked account, Mary\'s little Charlie had sneezed\r\nthree times, and his mamma must regret what sent all the medical\r\nscience of Stoneborough away by the early train.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tom came home at night.  The interview had been satisfactory.\r\nThe letters received in the morning had prepared the way, and revived\r\nthe recollection of the unsatisfactory case of Leonard Axworthy Ward,\r\nand of the representations of the then Mayor of Market Stoneborough.\r\nAfter all the new lights upon the matter had been looked into, the\r\nfather and son had been assured that, as soon as possible, a free\r\npardon should be issued, so drawn up as to imply a declaration of\r\ninnocence--the nearest possible approach to a reversal of the sentence;\r\nand they further were told of a mention of his exemplary conduct in a\r\nlate report from Portland, containing a request that he might be\r\npromoted to a post of greater influence and trust before the ordinary\r\ntime of probation had passed.  Dr. May was eager to be at Portland at\r\nthe same time as the pardon, so to give Leonard the first intelligence,\r\nand to bring him home; and he had warmly closed with Tom\'s offer to\r\nlook after the work, while he himself waited till the necessary forms\r\nhad been complied with.  He had absolutely begged Tom\'s pardon for\r\ngoing in his stead.  \'It is your right,\' he said; \'but, somehow, I\r\nthink, as I have been more with him, I might do better.\'  To which Tom\r\nhad assented with all his heart, and had added that he would not go if\r\nhe were paid for it.  He had further taken care that the Doctor should\r\ntake with him a suit of clothes for Leonard to come home in, and had\r\nhimself made the selection; then came back with the tidings that filled\r\nthe house with the certainty of joy, and the uncertainty of expectation.\r\n\r\nNobody was, however, in such a fever as Tom himself.  He was\r\nmarvellously restless all the morning.  Gertrude asserted it was\r\nbecause he was miserable at not venturing to set his father\'s study to\r\nrights; and to be sure he was seen looking round at the litter with a\r\nface of great disgust, and declaring that he was ashamed to see a\r\npatient in a room in such a mess.  But this did not fully account for\r\nhis being in and out, backwards and forwards, all the morning, looking\r\nwistfully at Ethel, and then asking some trivial question about\r\nmessages left for his father, or matters respecting his own new abode,\r\nwhere he kept on Dr. Spencer\'s old housekeeper, and was about to turn\r\nin paperers and painters.  He had actually brought a drawing-room paper\r\nfrom Paris, a most delicate and graceful affair, much too lady-like for\r\nthe old house, as Daisy told him, when she pursued him and her sister\r\ndown to a consultation.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon, as the sisters were coming up the High Street,\r\nthey met him setting out in Hector\'s dog-cart.  \'Oh, I say, Ethel,\' he\r\nsaid, drawing up, \'do you like a drive out to Chilford?  Here\'s a note\r\ncome to ask my father to see the old lady there, and I want some one to\r\ngive me courage to be looked at, like the curate in the pulpit instead\r\nof the crack preacher.\'\r\n\r\nIt was an offer not to be despised, though Ethel knew what a waiting\r\nthere would be, and what a dark drive home.  Up she jumped, and Tom\r\nshowed his usual thoughtfulness by ordering Gertrude to run home and\r\nfetch her muff and an additional cloak, tucking her up himself with the\r\ncarriage rug.  That affection of Tom\'s had been slow in coming, but\r\nalways gave her a sense of gratitude and enjoyment.\r\n\r\nThey drove all the seven miles to Chilford without twenty words passing\r\nbetween them; and when there, she sat in the road, and watched one\r\nconstellation after another fill up its complement of stars as well as\r\nthe moon permitted, wondering whether Tom\'s near-sighted driving would\r\nbe safe in the dark; but her heart was so light, so glad, that she\r\ncould not be afraid, she did not care how long she waited, it was only\r\nsitting still to recollect that deliverance had come to the\r\ncaptive--Leonard was free--\'free as heart can think or eye can see,\' as\r\nwould keep ringing in her ears like a joy-bell; and some better things,\r\ntoo.  \'Until the time came that his cause was known, the Word of the\r\nLord tried him.\'\r\n\r\nWhether she were really too happy to note time, or that gossipry was\r\ndeducted from the visit, Tom certainly returned sooner than her\r\nexperience had led her to expect, made an exclamation of dismay at\r\nfinding the machine was innocent of lamps, and remounted to his seat,\r\nprepared to be extremely careful.\r\n\r\n\'I could not get them to take me for my father in a new wig,\' he said;\r\n\'but it was a very easy-going rheumatic case, and I think I satisfied\r\nher.\'\r\n\r\nThen on he drove for a mile, till he was out of the bad cross-country\r\nroad, and at last he said, \'Ethel, I have made up my mind.  There\'s no\r\npress of work just now, and I find it is advisable I should go to\r\nAmerica before I get into harness here.\'\r\n\r\n\'To America!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, about this book of dear old Spencer\'s.  It is a thing that must\r\nbe complete, and I find he was in correspondence with some men of\r\nscience there.  I could satisfy my mind on a few points, which would\r\nmake it infinitely more valuable, you see--and get it published there\r\ntoo.  I know my father would wish every justice to be done to it.\'\r\n\r\n\'I know he would; and,\' continued Ethel, as innocently as she could,\r\n\'shall you see the Wards?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why,\' said Tom, in his deliberate voice, \'that is just one thing; I\r\nwant particularly to see Henry.  I had a talk with Wright this morning,\r\nand he tells me that young Baines, at Whitford, is going to the dogs,\r\nand the practice coming in to him.  He thinks of having a partner, and\r\nI put out a feeler in case Henry Ward should choose to come back, and\r\nfound it might do very well.  But the proposal must come from him, and\r\nthere\'s no time to be lost, so I thought of setting out as soon as I\r\nhear my father is on his way back.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not waiting to see Leonard?\'\r\n\r\n\'I did see him not a month ago.  Besides--\' and his voice came to a\r\nsudden end.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, the first news,\' said Ethel.  \'Indeed it is due to you, Tom.\'\r\n\r\nTen minutes more of silence.\r\n\r\n\'Ethel, did she ever tell you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Never,\' said Ethel, her heart beating.\r\n\r\n\'Then how did you know all about it?\'\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t know.  I only saw--\'\r\n\r\n\'Saw what?\'\r\n\r\n\'That you were very much distressed.\'\r\n\r\n\'And very kind and rational you were about it,\' said Tom, warmly; \'I\r\nnever thought any woman could have guessed so much, without making\r\nmischief.  But you must not put any misconstruction on my present\r\nintention.  All I mean to do as yet is to induce Henry to remove them\r\nout of that dismal swamp, and bring them home to comfort and\r\ncivilization.  Then it may be time to--\'\r\n\r\nHe became silent; and Ethel longed ardently to ask further, but still\r\nshe durst not, and he presently began again.\r\n\r\n\'Ethel, was I very intolerable that winter of the volunteers, when\r\nHarry was at home?\'\r\n\r\n\'You are very much improved since,\' she answered.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s just like Flora.  Answer like yourself.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, you were!  You were terribly rampant in Eton refinement, and\r\nvery anxious to hinder all the others from making fools of themselves.\'\r\n\r\n\'I remember!  I thought you had all got into intimacies that were for\r\nnobody\'s good, and I still think it was foolish.  I know it has done\r\nfor me!  Well,\' hastily catching up this last admission, as if it had\r\ndropped out at unawares, \'you think I made myself disagreeable?\'\r\n\r\n\'On principle.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah! then you would not wonder at what she said--that she had never\r\nseen anything in me but contemptuous irony.\'\r\n\r\n\'I think, sometimes feeling that you were satirical, she took all your\r\ncourtesy for irony--whatever you meant.  I have heard other people say\r\nthe same.  But when--was this on the day--the day you went to\r\nremonstrate?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  I declare to you, Ethel, that I had no conception of what I was\r\ngoing to do!  I never dreamt that I was in for it.  I knew she was--was\r\nattractive--and that made me hate to see Harry with her, and I could\r\nnot bear her being carried off to this horrible place--but as to\r\nmyself, I never thought of it till I saw her--white and broken--\' and\r\nthen came that old action Ethel knew so well in her father, of clearing\r\nthe dew from the glasses, and his voice was half sob, \'and with no\r\ncreature but that selfish brother to take care of her.  I couldn\'t help\r\nit, Ethel--no one could--and this--this was her answer. I don\'t wonder.\r\nI had been a supercilious prig, and I ought to have known better than\r\nto think I could comfort her.\'\r\n\r\n\'I think the remembrance must have comforted her since.\'\r\n\r\n\'What--what, has she said anything?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh no, she could not, you know.  But I am sure, if it did anger her at\r\nthe moment, there must have been comfort in recollecting that even such\r\na terrible trouble had not alienated you.  And now--\'\r\n\r\n\'Now that\'s just what I don\'t want!  I don\'t want to stalk in and say\r\nhere\'s the hero of romance that has saved your brother!  I want to get\r\nher home, and show her that I can be civil without being satirical, and\r\nthen, perhaps, she would forgive me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Forgive you--\'\r\n\r\n\'I mean forgiveness won, not purchased.  And after all, you know it was\r\nmere accident--Providence if you please--that brought me to that poor\r\nwretch; all my plans of tracking him had come to an end; any one else\r\ncould have done what I did.\'\r\n\r\n\'She will not feel that,\' said Ethel; \'but indeed, Tom, I see what you\r\nmean, and like it.  It is yourself, and not the conferrer of the\r\nbenefit, that you want her to care for.\'\r\n\r\n\'Exactly,\' said Tom.  \'And, Ethel, I must have seen her and judged of\r\nmy chance before I can be good for anything.  I tried to forget it--own\r\nit as a lucky escape--a mere passing matter, like Harry\'s affairs--but\r\nI could not do it.  Perhaps I could if things had gone well; but that\r\ndear face of misery, that I only stung by my attempts to comfort, would\r\nstick fast with me, and to go and see Leonard only brought it more\r\nhome.  It is a horrid bad speculation, and Flora and Cheviot and\r\nBlanche will scout it; but, Ethel, you\'ll help me through, and my\r\nfather will not mind, I know.\'\r\n\r\n\'Papa will feel as I do, Tom--that it has been your great blessing,\r\nturn out as it may.\'\r\n\r\n\'H\'m! has it?  A blessing on the wrong side of one\'s mouth--to go about\r\nwith a barb one knew one was a fool for, and yet couldn\'t forget!\r\nWell, I know what you mean, and I believe it was.  I would not have had\r\nit annihilated, when the first mood was over.\'\r\n\r\n\'It was that which made it so hard to you to come home, was it not?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; but it was odd enough, however hard it was to think of coming,\r\nyou always sent me away more at peace, Ethel.  I can\'t think how you\r\ndid it, knowing nothing.\'\r\n\r\n\'I think you came at the right time.\'\r\n\r\n\'You see, I did think that while Spencer lived, I might follow up the\r\ntrack, and see a little of the world--try if that would put out that\r\nface and voice.  But it won\'t do.  If this hadn\'t happened, I would\r\nhave tied myself down, and done my best to get comfort out of you, and\r\nthe hospital, and these \'Diseases of Climate\'--I suppose one might in\r\ntime, if things went well with her; but, as it is, I can\'t rest till I\r\nhave seen if they can be got home again.  So, Ethel, don\'t mind if I go\r\nbefore my father comes home.  I can\'t stand explanations with him, and\r\nI had rather you did not proclaim this. You see the book, and getting\r\nHenry home, are really the reasons, and I shan\'t molest her\r\nagain--no--not till she has learnt to know what is irony.\'\r\n\r\n\'I think if you did talk it over with papa, you would feel the comfort,\r\nand know him better.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, well, I dare say, but I can\'t do it, Ethel.  Either he shuts me\r\nup at first, with some joke, or--\' and Tom stopped; but Ethel knew what\r\nhe meant.  There was on her father\'s side an involuntary absence of\r\nperfect trust in this son, and on Tom\'s there was a character so\r\nsensitive that her father\'s playfulness grated, and so reserved that\r\nhis demonstrative feelings were a still greater trial to one who could\r\nnot endure outward emotion.  \'Besides,\' added Tom, \'there is really\r\nnothing--nothing to tell.  I\'m not going to commit myself.  I don\'t\r\nknow whether I ever shall.  I was mad that day, and I want to satisfy\r\nmy mind whether I think the same now I am sane, and if I do, I shall\r\nhave enough to do to make her forget the winter when I made myself such\r\nan ass.  When I have done that, it may be time to speak to my father.\r\nI really am going out about the book.  When did you hear last?\'\r\n\r\n\'That is what makes me anxious.  I have not heard for two months, and\r\nthat is longer than she ever was before without writing, except when\r\nMinna was ill.\'\r\n\r\n\'We shall know if Leonard has heard.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, she always writes under cover to us.\'\r\n\r\nThe course that the conversation then took did not look much like Tom\'s\r\ndoubt whether his own views would be the same.  All the long-repressed\r\ndiscussion of Averil\'s merits, her beautiful eyes, her sweet voice, her\r\nrefinement, her real worth, the wonder that she and Leonard should be\r\nso superior to the rest of the family, were freely indulged at last,\r\nand Ethel could give far heartier sympathy than if this had come to her\r\nthree years ago.  Averil had been for two years her correspondent, and\r\nthe patient sweetness and cheerfulness of those letters had given a far\r\nhigher estimate of her nature than the passing intercourse of the town\r\nlife had left.  The terrible discipline of these years of exile and\r\nsorrow had, Ethel could well believe, worked out something very\r\ndifferent from the well-intentioned wilful girl whose spirit of\r\npartisanship had been so fatal an element of discord.  Distance had, in\r\ntruth, made them acquainted, and won their love to one another.\r\n\r\nTom\'s last words, as he drew up under the lime-trees before the door,\r\nwere, \'Mind, I am only going about the \'Diseases of Climate\'.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n    And Bishop Gawain as he rose,\r\n  Said, \'Wilton, grieve not for thy woes,\r\n         Disgrace and trouble;\r\n  For He who honour best bestows,\r\n         Can give thee double.\'--Marmion\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. May had written to Portland, entreating that no communication might\r\nbe made to Leonard Ward before his arrival; and the good physician\'s\r\naffection for the prisoner had been so much observed, that no one would\r\nhave felt it fair to anticipate him.  Indeed, he presented himself at\r\nthe prison gates only two hours after the arrival of the documents,\r\nwhen no one but the governor was aware of their contents.\r\n\r\nLeonard was as usual at his business in the schoolmaster\'s department;\r\nand thither a summons was sent for him, while Dr. May and the governor\r\nalone awaited his arrival.  Tom\'s visit was still very recent; and\r\nLeonard entered with anxious eyes, brow drawn together, and compressed\r\nlips, as though braced to meet another blow; and the unusual room, the\r\npresence of the governor instead of the warder, and Dr. May\'s\r\nirrepressible emotion, so confirmed the impression, that his face at\r\nonce assumed a resolute look of painful expectation.\r\n\r\n\'My boy,\' said Dr. May, clasping both his hands in his own, \'you have\r\nborne much of ill.  Can you bear to hear good news?\'\r\n\r\n\'Am I to be sent out to Australia already?\' said Leonard--for a\r\nshortening of the eight years before his ticket-of-leave was the sole\r\nhope that had presented itself.\r\n\r\n\'Sent out, yes; out to go wherever you please, Leonard.  The right is\r\ncome round.  The truth is out.  You are a free man!  Do you know what\r\nthat is?  It is a pardon.  Your pardon.  All that can be done to right\r\nyou, my boy--but it is as good as a reversal of the sentence.\'\r\n\r\nThe Doctor had spoken this with pauses; going on, as Leonard, instead\r\nof answering, stood like one in a dream, and at last said with\r\ndifficulty, \'Who did it then?\'\r\n\r\n\'It was as you always believed.\'\r\n\r\n\'Has he told?\' said Leonard, drawing his brows together with the effort\r\nto understand.\r\n\r\n\'No, Leonard.  The vengeance he had brought on himself did not give\r\nspace for repentance; but the pocket-book, with your receipt, was upon\r\nhim, and your innocence is established.\'\r\n\r\n\'And let me congratulate you,\' added the governor, shaking hands with\r\nhim; \'and add, that all I have known of you has been as complete an\r\nexculpation as any discovery can be.\'\r\n\r\nLeonard\'s hand was passive, his cheek had become white, his forehead\r\nstill knit.  \'Axworthy!\' he said, still as in a trance.\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  Hurt in a brawl at Paris.  He was brought to the Hotel Dieu; and\r\nmy son Tom was called to see him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Sam Axworthy! repeated Leonard, putting his hand over his eyes, as if\r\none sensation overpowered everything else; and thus he stood for some\r\nseconds, to the perplexity of both.\r\n\r\nThey showed him the papers: he gazed, but without comprehension; and\r\nthen putting the bag, provided by Tom, into his hand, they sent him,\r\nmoving in a sort of mechanical obedience, into the room of one of the\r\nofficials to change his dress.\r\n\r\nDr. May poured out to the governor and chaplain, who by this time had\r\njoined them, the history of Leonard\'s generous behaviour at the time of\r\nthe trial, and listened in return to their account of the growing\r\nimpression he had created--a belief, almost reluctant, that instead of\r\nbeing their prime specimen, he could only be in their hands by mistake.\r\nHe was too sincere not to have confessed had he been really guilty; and\r\nin the long run, such behaviour as his would have been impossible in\r\none unrepentant.  He had been the more believed from the absence of\r\ncomplaint, demonstration, or assertion; and the constant endeavour to\r\navoid notice, coupled with the quiet thorough execution of whatever was\r\nset before him with all his might.\r\n\r\nThis was a theme to occupy the Doctor for a long time; but at last he\r\ngrew eager for Leonard\'s return, and went to hasten him.  He started\r\nup, still in the convict garb, the bag untouched.\r\n\r\n\'I beg your pardon,\' he said, when his friend\'s exclamation had\r\nreminded him of what had been desired of him; and in a few minutes he\r\nreappeared in the ordinary dress of a gentleman, but the change did not\r\nseem to have made him realize his freedom--there was the same\r\nsubmissive manner, the same conventional gesture of respect in reply to\r\nthe chaplain\'s warm congratulation.\r\n\r\n\'Come, Leonard, I am always missing the boat, but I don\'t want to do so\r\nnow.  We must get home to-night.  Have you anything to take with you?\'\r\n\r\n\'My Bible and Prayer-Book.  They are my own, sir;\' as he turned to the\r\ngovernor.  \'May I go to my cell for them?\'\r\n\r\nAgain they tarried long for him, and became afraid that he had fallen\r\ninto another reverie; but going to fetch him, found that the delay was\r\ncaused by the farewells of all who had come in his way.  The tidings of\r\nhis full justification had spread, and each official was eager to wish\r\nhim good speed, and thank him for the aid of his example and support.\r\nThe schoolmaster, who had of late treated him as a friend, kept close\r\nto him, rejoicing in his liberation, but expecting to miss him sorely;\r\nand such of the convicts as were within reach, were not without their\r\nshare in the general exultation.  He had never galled them by his\r\nsuperiority; and though Brown, the clerk, had been his only friend, he\r\nhad done many an act of kindness; and when writing letters for the\r\nunlearned, had spoken many a wholesome simple word that had gone home\r\nto the heart.  His hand was as ready for a parting grasp from a\r\nfellow-prisoner as from a warder; and his thought and voice were\r\nrecalled to leave messages for men out of reach; his eyes moistened at\r\nthe kindly felicitations; but when he was past the oft-trodden\r\nprecincts of the inner court and long galleries, the passiveness\r\nreturned, and he received the last good-byes of the governor and\r\nsuperior officers, as if only half alive to their import.  And thus,\r\nsilent, calm, and grave, his composure like that of a man walking in\r\nhis sleep, did Leonard Ward pass the arched gateway, enter on the outer\r\nworld, and end his three and a half years of penal servitude.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m less like an angel than he is like St. Peter,\' thought Dr. May, as\r\nhe watched the fixed dreamy gaze, \'but this is like "yet wist he not\r\nthat it was true, but thought he saw a vision."  When will he realize\r\nliberty, and enjoy it?  I shall do him a greater kindness by leaving\r\nhim to himself.\'\r\n\r\nAnd in spite of his impatience, Dr. May refrained from disturbing that\r\nopen-eyed trance all the way down the long hill, trusting to the crowd\r\nin the steamer for rousing him to perceive that he was no longer among\r\nrusset coats and blue shirts; but he stood motionless, gazing, or at\r\nleast his face turned, towards the Dorset coast, uttering no word,\r\nmaking no movement, save when summoned by his guide--then obeying as\r\nimplicitly as though it were his jailor.\r\n\r\nSo they came to the pier; and so they walked the length of Weymouth,\r\npaced the platform, and took their places in the train.  Just as they\r\nhad shot beyond the town, and come into the little wooded valleys\r\nbeyond, Leonard turned round, and with the first sparkle in his eye,\r\nexclaimed, \'Trees!  Oh, noble trees and hedges!\' then turned again to\r\nlook in enchantment at the passing groups--far from noble, though\r\nbright with autumn tints--that alternated with the chalk downs.\r\n\r\nDr. May was pleased at this revival, and entertained at the start and\r\nglance of inquiring alarm from an old gentleman in the other corner.\r\nPresently, in the darkness of a cutting, again Leonard spoke: \'Where\r\nare you taking me, Dr. May?\'\r\n\r\n\'Home, of course.\'\r\n\r\nWhatever the word might imply to the poor lad, he was satisfied, and\r\nagain became absorbed in the sight of fields, trees, and hedgerows;\r\nwhile Dr. May watched the tokens of secret dismay in their\r\nfellow-traveller, who had no doubt understood \'home\' to mean his\r\nprivate asylum.  Indeed, though the steady full dark eyes showed no\r\naberration, there was a strange deep cave between the lid and the\r\neyebrow, which gave a haggard look; the spare, worn, grave features had\r\nan expression--not indeed weak, nor wandering, but half bewildered,\r\nhalf absorbed, moreover, in spite of Tom\'s minute selection of apparel,\r\nit had been too hasty a toilette for the garments to look perfectly\r\nnatural; and the cropped head was so suspicious, that it was no wonder\r\nthat at the first station, the old gentleman gathered up his umbrella,\r\nwith intense courtesy squeezed gingerly to the door, carefully avoiding\r\nany stumble over perilous toes, and made his escape--entering another\r\ncarriage, whence he no doubt signed cautions against the lunatic and\r\nhis keeper, since no one again invaded their privacy.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this incident most fully revealed to the Doctor, how unlike\r\nother people his charge was, how much changed from the handsome\r\nspirited lad on whom the trouble had fallen; and he looked again and\r\nagain at the profile turned to the window, as fixed and set as though\r\nit had been carved.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, patience is an exhausting virtue!\' said he to himself.  \'Verily it\r\nis bearing--bearing up under the full weight; and the long bent spring\r\nis the slower in rebounding in proportion to its inherent strength.\r\nPoor lad, what protracted endurance it has been!  There is health and\r\nforce in his face; no line of sin, nor sickness, nor worldly care, such\r\nas it makes one\'s heart ache to see aging young faces; yet how utterly\r\nunlike the face of one and-twenty!  I had rather see it sadder than so\r\nstrangely settled and sedate!  Shall I speak to him again?  Not yet:\r\nthose green hill-sides, those fields and cattle, must refresh him\r\nbetter than my clavers, after his grim stony mount of purgatory.  I\r\nwish it were a brighter day to greet him, instead of this gray damp\r\nfog.\'\r\n\r\nThe said fog prevented any semblance of sunset; but through the gray\r\nmoonlit haze, Leonard kept his face to the window, pertinaciously\r\nclearing openings in the bedewed glass, as though the varying outline\r\nof the horizon had a fascination for him.  At last, after ten minutes\r\nof glaring gas at a junction had by contrast rendered the mist\r\nimpenetrable, and reduced the view to brightened clouds of steam, and\r\nto white telegraphic posts, erecting themselves every moment, with\r\ntheir wires changing their perspective in incessant monotony, he ceased\r\nhis gaze, and sat upright in his place, with the same strange rigid\r\nsomnambulist air.\r\n\r\nDr. May resolved to rouse him.\r\n\r\n\'Well, Leonard,\' he said, \'this has been a very long fever; but we are\r\nwell through it at last--with the young doctor from Paris to our aid.\'\r\n\r\nProbably Leonard only heard the voice, not the words, for he passed his\r\nhand over his face, and looked up to the Doctor, saying dreamily, \'Let\r\nme see!  Is it all true?\' and then, with a grave wistful look, \'It was\r\nnot I who did that thing, then?\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear!\' exclaimed the Doctor, starting forward, and catching hold of\r\nhis hand, \'have they brought you to this?\'\r\n\r\n\'I always meant to ask you, if I ever saw you alone again,\' said\r\nLeonard.\r\n\r\n\'But you don\'t mean that you have imagined it!\'\r\n\r\n\'Not constantly--not when any one was with me,\' said Leonard, roused by\r\nDr. May\'s evident dismay; and drawn on by his face of anxious inquiry.\r\n\'At Milbank, I generally thought I remembered it just as they described\r\nit in court, and that it was some miserable ruinous delusion that\r\nhindered my confessing; but the odd thing was, that the moment any one\r\nopened my door, I forgot all about it, resolutions and all, and was\r\nmyself again.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then surely--surely you left that horror with the solitude?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, till lately; but when it did come back, I could not be sure what\r\nwas recollection of fact, and what of my own fancy;\' and he drew his\r\nbrows together in painful effort.  \'Did I know who did it, or did I\r\nonly guess?\'\r\n\r\n\'You came to a right conclusion, and would not let me act on it.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I really did write the receipt, and not dream it?\'\r\n\r\n\'That receipt has been in my hand.  It was what has brought you here.\'\r\nAnd now to hearing ears, Dr. May went over the narrative; and Leonard\r\nstood up under the little lamp in the roof of the carriage to read the\r\npapers.\r\n\r\n\'I recollect--I understand,\' he said, presently, and sat down, grave\r\nand meditative--no longer dreamy, but going over events, which had at\r\nlast acquired assurance to his memory from external circumstances.\r\nPresently his fingers were clasped together over his face, his head\r\nbent, and then he looked up, and said, \'Do they know it--my sister and\r\nbrother?\'\r\n\r\n\'No.  We would not write till you were free.  You must date the first\r\nletter from Stoneborough.\'\r\n\r\nThe thought had brought a bitter pang.  \'One half year sooner--\' and he\r\nleant back in his seat, with fingers tightly pressed together, and\r\ntrembling with emotion.\r\n\r\n\'Nay, Leonard; may not the dear child be the first to rejoice in the\r\nfulfilment of her own sweet note of comfort?  They could not harm the\r\ninnocent.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not innocent,\' he said, \'not innocent of causing all the discord that\r\nhas ended in their exile, and the dear child\'s death.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then this is what has preyed on you, and changed you so much more of\r\nlate,\' said Dr. May.\r\n\r\n\'When I knew that I was indeed guilty of _her_ death,\' said Leonard, in\r\na calm full conviction of too long standing to be accompanied with\r\nagitation, though permanently bowing him down.\r\n\r\n\'And you never spoke of this: not to the chaplain?\'\r\n\r\n\'I never could.  It would have implied all the rest that he could not\r\nbelieve.  And it would not have changed the fact.\'\r\n\r\n\'The aspect of it may change, Leonard.  You know yourself how many\r\nimmediate causes combined, of which you cannot accuse yourself--your\r\nbrother\'s wrongheadedness, and all the rest.  And,\' added the Doctor,\r\nrecovering himself, \'you do see it in other aspects, I know.  Think of\r\nthe spirit set free to be near you--free from the world that has gone\r\nso hard with you!\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t keep that thought long; I\'m not worthy of it.\'\r\n\r\nAgain he was silent; but presently said, as with a sudden thought, \'You\r\nwould have told me if there were any news of Ave.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, there has been no letter since her last inclosure for you,\' and\r\nthen Dr. May gave the details from the papers on the doings of Henry\'s\r\ndivision of the army.\r\n\r\n\'Will Henry let me be with them?\' said Leonard, musingly.\r\n\r\n\'They will come home, depend upon it.  You must wait till you hear.\'\r\n\r\nLeonard thought a little while, then said, \'Where did you say I was to\r\ngo, Dr. May?\'\r\n\r\n\'Where, indeed?  Home, Leonard--home.  Ethel is waiting for us.  To the\r\nHigh Street.\'\r\n\r\nLeonard looked up again with his bewildered face, then said, \'I know\r\nwhat you do with me will be right, but--\'\r\n\r\n\'Had you rather not?\' said the Doctor, startled.\r\n\r\n\'Rather!\' and the Doctor, to his exceeding joy, saw the fingers over\r\nhis eyes moist with the tears they tried to hide; \'I only meant--\' he\r\nadded, with an effort, \'you must think and judge--I can\'t\r\nthink--whether I ought.\'\r\n\r\n\'If you ask me that,\' said Dr. May, earnestly, \'all I have to say is,\r\nthat I don\'t know what palace is worthy of you.\'\r\n\r\nThere was not much said after that; and the Doctor fell asleep, waking\r\nonly at the halts at stations to ask where he was.\r\n\r\nAt last came \'Blewer!\' and as the light shone on the clock, Leonard\r\nsaid, \'A quarter past twelve!  It is the very train I went by!  Is it a\r\ndream?\'\r\n\r\nTen minutes more, and \'Stoneborough\' was the cry.  Hastily springing\r\nout, shuffling the tickets into the porter\'s hand, and grappling\r\nLeonard\'s arm as if he feared an escape, Dr. May hurried him into the\r\nempty streets, and strode on in silence.\r\n\r\nThe pull at the door-bell was answered instantly by Ethel herself. She\r\nheld out her hand, and grasped that which Leonard had almost withheld,\r\nshrinking as from too sudden a vision; and then she ardently exchanged\r\nkisses with her father.\r\n\r\n\'Where\'s Tom?  Gone to bed?\' said Dr. May, stepping into the bright\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said Ethel, demurely; \'he is gone--he is gone to America.\'\r\n\r\nThe Doctor gave a prodigious start, and looked at her again.\r\n\r\n\'He went this afternoon.\' she said.  \'There is some matter about the\r\n\'Diseases of Climate\' that he must settle before the book is published;\r\nand he thought he could best be spared now.  He has left messages that\r\nI will give you by and by; but you must both be famished.\'\r\n\r\nHer looks indicated that all was right, and both turned to welcome the\r\nguest, who stood where the first impulse had left him, in the hall, not\r\nmoving forward, till he was invited in to the fire, and the meal\r\nalready spread.  He then obeyed, and took the place pointed out; while\r\nthe Doctor nervously expatiated on the cold, damp, and changes of\r\ntrain; and Ethel, in the active bashfulness of hidden agitation, made\r\ntea, cut bread, carved chicken, and waited on them with double\r\nassiduity, as Leonard, though eating as a man who had fasted since\r\nearly morning, was passive as a little child, merely accepting what was\r\noffered to him, and not even passing his cup till she held out her hand\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nShe did not even dare to look at him; she could not bear that he should\r\nsee her do so; it was enough to know that he was free--that he was\r\nthere--that it was over.  She did not want to see how it had changed\r\nhim; and, half to set him at ease, half to work off her own excitement,\r\nshe talked to her father, and told him of the little events of his\r\nabsence till the meal was over; and, at half-past one, good nights were\r\nexchanged with Leonard, and the Doctor saw him to his room, then\r\nreturned to his daughter on her own threshold.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s a thing to have lived for,\' he said.\r\n\r\nEthel locked her hands together, and looked up.\r\n\r\n\'And now, how about this other denouement?  I might have guessed that\r\nthe wind sat in that quarter.\'\r\n\r\n\'But you\'re not to guess it, papa.  It is really and truly about the\r\n\'Diseases of Climate\'.\'\r\n\r\n\'Swamp fevers, eh! and agues!\'\r\n\r\nThe \'if you can help it,\' was a great comfort now; Ethel could venture\r\non saying, \'Of course that has something to do with it; but he really\r\ndoes make the book his object; and please--please don\'t give any hint\r\nthat you suspect anything else.\'\r\n\r\n\'I suppose you are in his confidence; and I must ask no questions.\'\r\n\r\n\'I hated not telling you, and letting you tease him; but he trusted me\r\njust enough not to make me dare to say a word; though I never was sure\r\nthere was a word to say.  Now do just once own, papa, that Tom is the\r\nromantic one after all, to have done as he did in the height of the\r\ntrouble.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well in his place so should I,\' said the Doctor, with the perverseness\r\nof not satisfying expectations of amazement.\r\n\r\n\'_You_ would,\' said Ethel; \'but Tom! would you have thought it of Tom?\'\r\n\r\n\'Tom has more in him than shows through his spectacles,\' answered Dr.\r\nMay.  \'So!  That\'s the key to his restless fit.  Poor fellow!  How did\r\nit go with him?  They have not been carrying it on all this time,\r\nsurely!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, no, no, papa!  She cut him to the heart, poor boy! thought he was\r\nlaughing at her--told him it had all been irony.  He has no notion\r\nwhether she will ever forgive him.\'\r\n\r\n\'A very good lesson, Master Doctor Thomas,\' said Dr. May, with a\r\ntwinkle in his eye; \'and turn out as it will, it has done him\r\ngood--tided him over a dangerous time of life.  Well, you must tell me\r\nall about it to-morrow; I\'m too sleepy to know what I\'m talking of.\'\r\n\r\nThe sleepiness that always finished off the Doctor\'s senses at the\r\nright moment, was a great preservative of his freshness and vigour; but\r\nEthel was far from sharing it, and was very glad when the clock sounded\r\na legitimate hour for getting up, and dressing by candle-light, briefly\r\nanswering Gertrude\'s eager questions on the arrival. It was a pouring\r\nwet morning, and she forbade Daisy to go to church--indeed, it would\r\nhave been too bad for herself on any morning but this--any but this, as\r\nshe repeated, smiling at her own spring of thankfulness, as she\r\nfortified herself with a weight of waterproof, and came forth in the\r\ndarkness of 7.45, on a grim November day.\r\n\r\nA few steps before her, pacing on, umbrellaless, was a figure which\r\nmade her hurry to overtake him.\r\n\r\n\'O, Leonard! after your journey, and in this rain!\'\r\n\r\nHe made a gesture of courtesy, but moved as if to follow, not join her.\r\nDid he not know whether he were within the pale of humanity?\r\n\r\n\'Here is half an umbrella.  Won\'t you hold it for me?\' she said; and as\r\nhe followed his instinct of obedience, she put it into his hand, and\r\ntook his arm, thinking that this familiarity would best restore him to\r\na sense of his regained position; and, moreover, feeling glad and\r\ntriumphant to be thus leaning, and to have that strong arm to contend\r\nwith the driving blast that came howling round the corner of Minster\r\nStreet, and fighting for their shelter.  They were both out of breath\r\nwhen they paused to recover in the deep porch of the Minster.\r\n\r\n\'Is Dr. May come home?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes--and--\'\r\n\r\nEthel signed, and Mr. Wilmot held out an earnest hand, with, \'This is\r\nwell.  I am glad to see you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, sir,\' said Leonard, heartily; \'and for all--\'\r\n\r\n\'This is your new beginning of life, Leonard.  God bless you in it.\'\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Wilmot passed on, Ethel for the first time ventured to look up\r\ninto the eyes--and saw their hollow setting, their loss of sparkle, but\r\ntheir added steadfastness and resolution.  She could not help repeating\r\nthe long-treasured lines: \'And, Leonard,\r\n\r\n\r\n                         "--grieve not for thy woes,\r\n                    Disgrace and trouble;\r\n                    For He who honour best bestows,\r\n                       Shall give thee double."\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve never ceased to be glad you read Marmion with me,\' he hastily\r\nsaid, as they turned into church on hearing a clattering of choristers\r\nbehind them.\r\n\r\nClara might have had such sensations when she bound the spurs on her\r\nknight\'s heels, yet even she could hardly have had so pure, unselfish,\r\nand exquisite a joy as Ethel\'s, in receiving the pupil who had been in\r\na far different school from hers.\r\n\r\nThe gray dawn through the gloom, the depths of shadow in the twilight\r\nchurch, softening and rendering all more solemn and mysterious, were\r\nmore in accordance than bright and beamy sunshine with her subdued\r\ngrave thankfulness; and there was something suitable in the fewness of\r\nthe congregation that had gathered in the Lady Chapel--so few, that\r\nthere was no room for shyness, either in, or for, him who was again\r\ntaking his place there, with steady composed demeanour, its stillness\r\nconcealing so much.\r\n\r\nEthel had reckoned on the verse--\'That He might hear the mournings of\r\nsuch as are in captivity, and deliver the children appointed unto\r\ndeath.\'  But she had not reckoned on its falling on her ears in the\r\ndeep full-toned melodious bass, that came in, giving body to the young\r\nnotes of the choristers--a voice so altered and mellowed since she last\r\nhad heard it, that it made her look across in doubt, and recognize in\r\nthe uplifted face, that here indeed the freed captive was at home, and\r\nlifted above himself.\r\n\r\nWhen the clause, in the Litany, for all prisoners and captives brought\r\nto her the thrill that she had only to look up to see the fulfilment of\r\nmany and many a prayer for one captive, for once she did not hear the\r\nresponse, only saw the bent head, as though there were thoughts went\r\ntoo deep to find voice.  And again, there was the special thanksgiving\r\nthat Mr. Wilmot could not refrain from introducing for one to whom a\r\ngreat mercy had been vouchsafed. If Ethel had had to swim home, she\r\nwould not but have been there!\r\n\r\nCharles Cheviot addressed them as they came out of church: \'Good\r\nmorning--Mr. Ward, I hope to do myself the honour of calling on you--I\r\nshall see you again, Ethel.\r\n\r\nAnd off he went over the glazy stones to his own house, Ethel knowing\r\nthat this cordial salutation and intended call were meant to be\r\nhonourable amends for his suspicions; but Leonard, unconscious of the\r\nimport, and scarcely knowing indeed that he was addressed, made his\r\nmechanical gesture of respect, and looked up, down, and round, absorbed\r\nin the scene.  \'How exactly the same it all looks,\' he said; \'the\r\ncloister gate, and the Swan, and the postman in the very same\r\nwaterproof cape.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you not feel like being just awake?\'\r\n\r\n\'No; it is more like being a ghost, or somebody else.\'\r\n\r\nThen the wind drove them on too fast for speech, till as they crossed\r\nthe High Street, Ethel pointed through the plane-trees to two round\r\nblack eyes, and a shining black nose, at the dining-room window.\r\n\r\n\'My Mab, my poor little Mab!--You have kept her all this time!  I was\r\nafraid to ask for her.  I could not hope it.\'\r\n\r\n\'I could not get my spoilt child, Gertrude, to bed without taking Mab,\r\nthat she might see the meeting.\'\r\n\r\nPerhaps it served Daisy right that the meeting did not answer her\r\nexpectations.  Mab and her master had both grown older; she smelt round\r\nhim long before she was sure of him, and then their content in one\r\nanother was less shown by fervent rapture, than by the quiet hand\r\nsmoothing her silken coat; and, in return, by her wistful eye, nestling\r\ngesture, gently waving tail.\r\n\r\nAnd Leonard!  How was it with him?  It was not easy to tell in his\r\nabsolute passiveness.  He seemed to have neither will nor impulse to\r\nspeak, move, or act, though whatever was desired of him, he did with\r\nthe implicit obedience that no one could bear to see.  They put books\r\nnear him, but he did not voluntarily touch one: they asked if he would\r\nwrite to his sister, and he took the pen in his hand, but did not\r\naccomplish a commencement.  Ethel asked him if he were tired, or had a\r\nheadache.\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, no,\' he said; \'I\'ll write,\' and made a dip in the ink.\r\n\r\n\'I did not mean to tease you,\' she said; \'the mail is not going just\r\nyet, and there is no need for haste.  I was only afraid something was\r\nwrong.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you,\' he said, submissively; \'I will--when I can think; but it\r\nis all too strange.  I have not seen a lady, nor a room like this,\r\nsince July three years.\'\r\n\r\nAfter that Ethel let him alone, satisfied that peace was the best means\r\nof recovering the exhaustion of his long-suffering.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty was that this was no house for quiet, especially the day\r\nafter the master\'s return: the door-bell kept on ringing, and each time\r\nhe looked startled and nervous, though assured that it was only\r\npatients.  But at twelve o\'clock in rushed Mr. Cheviot\'s little\r\nbrother, with a note from Mary, lamenting that it was too wet for\r\nherself, but saying that Charles was coming in the afternoon, and that\r\nhe intended to have a dinner-party of old Stoneborough scholars to\r\nwelcome Leonard back.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Martin Cheviot, wanting to see, and not to stare, and to\r\nunite cordiality and unconsciousness, made an awkward mixture of all,\r\nand did not know how to get away; and before he had accomplished it,\r\nMr. Edward Anderson was announced.  He heartily shook hands with\r\nLeonard, eagerly welcomed him, and talked volubly, and his last\r\ncommunication was, \'If it clears, you will see Matilda this afternoon.\'\r\n\r\n\'I did not know she was here.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; she and Harvey are come to Mrs. Ledwich\'s, to stay over Sunday;\'\r\nand there was a laugh in the corner of his eye, that convinced Ethel\r\nthat the torrents of rain would be no protection.\r\n\r\n\'Papa,\' said she, darting out to meet her father in the hall, \'you must\r\ntake Leonard out in your brougham this afternoon, if you don\'t want him\r\ndriven distracted.  If he is in the house, ropes won\'t hold Mrs. Harvey\r\nAnderson from him!\'\r\n\r\nSo Dr. May invited his guest to share his drive; and the excitement\r\nbegan to seem unreal when the Doctor returned alone.\r\n\r\n\'I dropped him at Cocksmoor,\' he said.  \'It was Richard\'s notion that\r\nhe would be quieter there--able to get out, and go to church, without\r\nbeing stared at.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did he like it?\' asked Gertrude, disappointed.\r\n\r\n\'If one told him to chop off his finger, he would do it, and never show\r\nwhether he liked it.  Richard asked him, and he said, "Thank you."  I\r\nnever could get an opening to show him that we did not want to suppress\r\nhim; I never saw spirit so quenched.\'\r\n\r\nCharles Cheviot thought it was a mistake to do what gave the appearance\r\nof suppression--he said that it was due to Leonard to welcome him as\r\nheartily as possible, and not to encourage false shame, where there was\r\nno disgrace; so he set his wife to fill up her cards for his\r\ndinner-party, and included in it Mr. and Mrs. Harvey Anderson, for the\r\nsake of their warm interest in the liberated prisoner.\r\n\r\n\'However, Leonard was out of the scrape,\' as the Doctor expressed it,\r\nfor he had one of his severe sore throats, and was laid up at\r\nCocksmoor.  Richard was dismayed by his passive obedience--a novelty to\r\nthe gentle eldest, who had all his life been submitting, and now was\r\npuzzled by his guest\'s unfailing acquiescence without a token of\r\npreference or independence: and comically amazed at the implicit\r\nfulfilment of his recommendation to keep the throat in bed--a wise\r\nsuggestion, but one that the whole house of May, in their own persons,\r\nwould have scouted.  Nothing short of the highest authority ever kept\r\nthem there.\r\n\r\nThe semblance of illness was perhaps a good starting-point for a return\r\nto the ways of the world; and on the day week of his going to\r\nCocksmoor, Ethel found him by the fire, beginning his letters to his\r\nbrother and sister, and looking brighter and more cheery, but so devoid\r\nof voice, that speech could not be expected of him.\r\n\r\nShe had just looked in again after some parish visiting, when a quick\r\nsoldierly step was heard, and in walked Aubrey.\r\n\r\n\'No; I\'m not come to you, Ethel; I\'m only come to this fellow;\' and he\r\nardently grasped his hand.  \'I\'ve got leave till Monday, and I shall\r\nstay here and see nobody else.--What, a sore throat?  Couldn\'t you get\r\nwrapped up enough between the two doctors?\'\r\n\r\nLeonard\'s eyes lighted as he muttered his hoarse \'Thank you,\' and Ethel\r\nlingered for a little desultory talk to her brother, contrasting the\r\nchanges that the three years had made in the two friends.  Aubrey,\r\ndrilled out of his home scholarly dreaminess by military and practical\r\ndiscipline, had exchanged his native languor for prompt upright\r\nalertness of bearing and speech; his eye had grown more steady, his\r\nmouth had lost its vague pensive expression, and was rendered sterner\r\nby the dark moustache; definite thought, purpose, and action, had\r\nmoulded his whole countenance and person into hopeful manhood, instead\r\nof visionary boyhood.  The other face, naturally the most full of fire\r\nand resolution, looked strangely different in its serious unsmiling\r\ngravity, the deeply worn stamp of patient endurance and utter\r\nisolation.  There was much of rest and calm, and even of content--but\r\nwithal a quenched look, as if the lustre of youth and hope had been\r\nextinguished, and the soul had been so driven in upon itself, that\r\nthere was no opening to receive external sympathy--a settled\r\nexpression, all the stranger on a face with the clear smoothness of\r\nearly youth.  One thing at least was unchanged--the firm friendship and\r\naffection--that kept the two constantly casting glances over one\r\nanother, to assure themselves of the presence before them.\r\n\r\nEthel left them together; and her father, who made out that he should\r\nsave time by going to Cocksmoor Church on Sunday morning, reported that\r\nthe boys seemed very happy together in their own way; but that Richard\r\nreported himself to have been at the sole expense of conversation in\r\nthe evening--the only time such an event could ever have occurred!\r\n\r\nAubrey returned home late on the Sunday evening; and Leonard set off to\r\nwalk part of the way with him in the dusk, but ended by coming the\r\nwhole distance, for the twilight opened their lips in this renewal of\r\nold habits.\r\n\r\n\'It is all right to be walking together again,\' said Aubrey, warmly;\r\n\'though it is not like those spring days.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve thought of them every Sunday.\'\r\n\r\n\'And what are you going to do now, old fellow?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know.\'\r\n\r\n\'I hear Bramshaw is going to offer you to come into his office.  Now,\r\ndon\'t do that, Leonard, whatever you do!\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are to have all your property back, you know, and you could do\r\nmuch better for yourself than that.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t tell till I have heard from my brother.\'\r\n\r\n\'But, Leonard, promise me now--you\'ll not go out and make a Yankee of\r\nyourself.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t tell; I shall do what he wishes.\'\r\n\r\nAubrey presently found that Leonard seemed to have no capacity to think\r\nor speak of the future or the past.  He set Aubrey off on his own\r\nconcerns, and listened with interest, asking questions that showed him\r\nperfectly alive to what regarded his friend, but the passive inaction\r\nof will and spirits still continued, and made him almost a\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning there was a squabble between the young engineer and\r\nthe Daisy, who was a profound believer in the scientific object of\r\nTom\'s journey, and greatly resented the far too obvious construction\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n\'You must read lots of bad novels at Chatham, Aubrey; it is like the\r\nfag end of the most trumpery of them all!\'\r\n\r\n\'You haven\'t gone far enough in your mathematics, you see, Daisy. You\r\nthink one and one--\'\r\n\r\n\'Make two.  So I say.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve gone into the higher branches.\'\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t think you were so simple and commonplace.  It would be so\r\nstupid to think he must--just because he could not help making this\r\ndiscovery.\'\r\n\r\n\'All for want of the higher branches of mathematics!  One plus\r\none--equals one.\'\r\n\r\n\'One minus common sense, plus folly, plus romance, minus anything to\r\ndo.  Your equation is worthy of Mrs. Harvey Anderson.  I gave her a\r\ngood dose of the \'Diseases of Climate!\'\'\r\n\r\nAubrey was looking at Ethel all the time Gertrude was triumphing; and\r\nfinally he said, \'I\'ve no absolute faith in disinterested philanthropy\r\nto a younger brother--whatever I had before I went to the Tyrol.\'\r\n\r\n\'What has that to do with it?\' asked Gertrude.  \'Everybody was cut up,\r\nand wanted a change--and you more than all.  I do believe the\r\npossibility of a love affair absolutely drives people mad: and now they\r\nmust needs saddle it upon poor Tom--just the one of the family who is\r\nnot so stupid, but has plenty of other things to think about.\'\r\n\r\n\'So you think it a stupid pastime?\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course it is.  Why, just look.  Hasn\'t everybody in the family\r\nturned stupid, and of no use, as soon at they went and fell in love!\r\nOnly good old Ethel here has too much sense, and that\'s what makes her\r\nsuch a dear old gurgoyle.  And Harry--he is twice the fun after he\r\ncomes home, before he gets his fit of love.  And all the story books\r\nthat begin pleasantly, the instant that love gets in, they are just\r\nalike--so stupid!  And now, if you haven\'t done it yourself, you want\r\nto lug poor innocent Tom in for it.\'\r\n\r\n\'When your time comes, may I be there to see!\'\r\n\r\nHe retreated from her evident designs of clapper-clawing him; and she\r\nturned round to Ethel with, \'Now, isn\'t it stupid, Ethel!\'\r\n\r\n\'Very stupid to think all the zest of life resides in one particular\r\nfeeling,\' said Ethel; \'but more stupid to talk of what you know nothing\r\nabout.\'\r\n\r\nAubrey put in his head for a hurried farewell, and, \'Telegraph to me\r\nwhen Mrs. Thomas May comes home.\'\r\n\r\n\'If Mrs. Thomas May comes home, I\'ll--\'\r\n\r\n\'Give her that chair cover,\' said Ethel; and her idle needlewoman,\r\nhaving been eight months working one corner of it, went off into fits\r\nof laughter, regarding its completion as an equally monstrous feat with\r\nan act of cannibalism on the impossible Mrs. Thomas May.\r\n\r\nHow different were these young things, with their rhodomontade and\r\nexuberant animation and spirits, from him in whom all the sparkle and\r\naspiration of life seemed extinguished!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n  A cup was at my lips: it pass\'d\r\n  As passes the wild desert blast!\r\n           *****\r\n  I woke--around me was a gloom\r\n  And silence of the tomb;\r\n  But in that awful solitude\r\n  That little spirit by me stood--\r\n  But oh, how changed!\r\n              --Thoughts in Past Years\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder Richard\'s kind let-alone system, Leonard was slowly recovering\r\ntone.  First he took to ruling lines in the Cocksmoor account-books,\r\nthen he helped in their audit; and with occupation came the sense of\r\nthe power of voluntary exertion.  He went and came freely, and began to\r\ntake long rambles in the loneliest parts of the heath and plantations,\r\nwhile Richard left him scrupulously to his own devices, and rejoiced to\r\nsee them more defined and vigorous every day.  The next stop was to\r\nassist in the night-school where Richard had hitherto toiled\r\nsingle-handed among very rough subjects.  The technical training and\r\nexperience derived from Leonard\'s work under the schoolmaster at\r\nPortland were invaluable; and though taking the lead was the last thing\r\nhe would have thought of, he no sooner entered the school than\r\nattention and authority were there, and Richard found that what had to\r\nhim been a vain and patient struggle was becoming both effective and\r\nagreeable.  Interest in his work was making Leonard cheerful and alert,\r\nthough still grave, and shrinking from notice--avoiding the town by\r\ndaylight, and only coming to Dr. May\'s in the dark evenings.\r\n\r\nOn the last Sunday in Advent, Richard was engaged to preach at his\r\noriginal curacy, and that the days before and after it should likewise\r\nbe spent away from home was insisted on after the manner of the friends\r\nof hard-working clergy.  He had the less dislike to going that he could\r\nleave his school-work to Leonard, who was to be housed at his father\'s,\r\nand there was soon perceived to have become a much more ordinary member\r\nof society than on his first arrival.\r\n\r\nOne evening, there was a loud peal at the door-bell, and the maid--one\r\nof Ethel\'s experiments of training--came in.\r\n\r\n\'Please, sir, a gentleman has brought a cockatoo and a letter and a\r\nlittle boy from the archdeacon.\'\r\n\r\n\'Archdeacon!\' cried Dr. May, catching sight of the handwriting on the\r\nletter and starting up.  \'Archdeacon Norman--\'\r\n\r\n\'One of Norman\'s stray missionaries and a Maori newly caught; oh, what\r\nfun!\' cried Daisy, in ecstasy.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, through the still open door, walking as if he had lived\r\nthere all his life, there entered the prettiest little boy that ever\r\nwas seen--a little knickerbocker boy, with floating rich dark ringlets,\r\nlike a miniature cavalier coming forth from a picture, with a white\r\ncockatoo on his wrist.  Not in the least confused, he went straight\r\ntowards Dr. May and said, \'Good-morning, grandpapa.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ha!  And who may you be, my elfin prince?\' said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m Dickie--Richard Rivers May--I\'m not an elfin prince,\' said the\r\nboy, with a moment\'s hurt feeling.  \'Papa sent me.\'  By that time the\r\nboy was fast in his grandfather\'s embrace, and was only enough released\r\nto give him space to answer the eager question, \'Papa--papa here?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh no; I came with Mr. Seaford.\'\r\n\r\nThe Doctor hastily turned Dickie over to the two aunts, and hastened\r\nforth to the stranger, whose name he well knew as a colonist\'s son, a\r\nfavourite and devoted clerical pupil of Norman\'s.\r\n\r\n\'Aunt Ethel,\' said little Richard, with instant recognition; \'mamma\r\nsaid you would be like her, but I don\'t think you will.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nor I, Dickie, but we\'ll try.  And who\'s that!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, what am I to be like?\' asked Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\'You\'re not Aunt Daisy--Aunt Daisy is a little girl.\'\r\n\r\nGertrude made him the lowest of curtseys; for not to be taken for a\r\nlittle girl was the compliment she esteemed above all others. Dickie\'s\r\nnext speech was, \'And is that Uncle Aubrey?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, that\'s Leonard.\'\r\n\r\nDickie shook hands with him very prettily; but then returning upon\r\nEthel, observed, \'I thought it was Uncle Aubrey, because soldiers\r\nalways cut their hair so close.\'\r\n\r\nThe other guest was so thoroughly a colonist, and had so little idea of\r\nanything but primitive hospitality, that he had had no notion of\r\nwriting beforehand to announce his coming, and accident had delayed the\r\nletters by which Norman and Meta had announced their decision of\r\nsending home their eldest boy under his care.\r\n\r\n\'Papa had no time to teach me alone,\' said Dickie, who seemed to have\r\nbeen taken into the family councils; \'and mamma is always busy, and I\r\nwasn\'t getting any good with some of the boys that come to school to\r\npapa.\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed, Mr. Dickie!\' said the Doctor, full of suppressed laughter.\r\n\r\n\'It is quite true,\' said Mr. Seaford; \'there are some boys that the\r\narchdeacon feels bound to educate, but who are not desirable companions\r\nfor his son.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is a great sacrifice,\' remarked the young gentleman.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Dickie, Dickie,\' cried Gertrude, in fits, \'don\'t you be a prig--\'\r\n\r\n\'Mamma said it,\' defiantly answered Dickie.\r\n\r\n\'Only a parrot,\' said Ethel, behind her handkerchief; but Dickie, who\r\nheard whatever he was not meant to hear, answered--\r\n\r\n\'It is not a parrot, it is a white cockatoo, that the chief of\r\n(something unutterable) brought down on his wrist like a hawk to the\r\nmission-ship; and that mamma sent as a present to Uncle George.\'\r\n\r\n\'I prefer the parrot that has fallen to my share,\' observed the Doctor.\r\n\r\nIt was by this time perched beside him, looking perfectly at ease and\r\nthoroughly at home.  There was something very amusing in the aspect of\r\nthe little man; he so completely recalled his mother\'s humming-bird\r\ntitle by the perfect look of finished porcelain perfection that even a\r\njourney from the Antipodes with only gentleman nursemaids had not\r\ndestroyed.  The ringleted rich brown hair shone like glossy silk, the\r\ncheeks were like painting, the trim well-made legs and small hands and\r\nfeet looked dainty and fairy-like, yet not at all effeminate; hands and\r\nface were a healthy brown, and contrasted with the little white collar,\r\nthe set of which made Ethel exclaim, \'Just look, Daisy, that\'s what I\r\nalways told you about Meta\'s doings.  Only I can\'t understand\r\nit.--Dickie, have the fairies kept you in repair ever since mamma\r\ndressed you last?\'\r\n\r\n\'We haven\'t any fairies in New Zealand,\' he replied; \'and mamma never\r\ndressed me since I was a baby!\'\r\n\r\n\'And what are you now?\' said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\'I am eight years old,\' said this piece of independence, perfectly well\r\nmannered, and au fait in all the customs of the tea-table; and when the\r\nmeal was over, he confidentially said to his aunt, \'Shall I come and\r\nhelp you wash up?  I never break anything.\'\r\n\r\nEthel declined this kind offer; but he hung on her hand and asked if he\r\nmight go and see the schoolroom, where papa and Uncle Harry used to\r\nblow soap-bubbles.  She lighted a candle, and the little gentleman\r\nshowed himself minutely acquainted with the whole geography of the\r\nhouse, knew all the rooms and the pictures, and where everything had\r\nhappened, even to adventures that Ethel had forgotten.\r\n\r\n\'It is of no use to say there are no fairies in New Zealand,\' said Dr.\r\nMay, taking him on his knee, and looking into the blue depths of\r\nNorman\'s eyes.  \'You have been head-waiter to Queen Mab, and\r\nperpetually here when she made you put a girdle round the earth in\r\nforty minutes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Papa read that to the boys, and they said it was stupid and no use,\'\r\nsaid Dickie; \'but papa said that the electric telegraph would do it.\'\r\n\r\nThe little cavalier appeared not to know what it was to be at a loss\r\nfor an answer, and the joint letter from his parents explained that his\r\nprecocious quickness was one of their causes for sending him home.  He\r\nwas so deft and useful as to be important in the household, and\r\nnecessarily always living with his father and mother, he took constant\r\npart in their conversation, and was far more learned in things than in\r\nbooks.  In the place where they were settled, trustworthy boy society\r\nwas unattainable, and they had felt their little son, in danger of\r\nbeing spoilt and made forward from his very goodness and\r\nbrightness--wrote Meta, \'If you find him a forward imp, recollect it is\r\nmy fault for having depended so much on him.\'\r\n\r\nHis escort was a specimen of the work Norman had done, not actual\r\nmission-work, but preparation and inspiriting of those who went forth\r\non the actual task.  He was a simple-minded, single-hearted man, one of\r\nthe first pupils in Norman\'s college, and the one who had most fully\r\nimbibed his spirit.  He had been for some years a clergyman, and\r\nlatterly had each winter joined the mission voyage among the Melanesian\r\nIsles, returning to their homes the lads brought for the summer for\r\neducation to the mission college in New Zealand, and spending some time\r\nat a station upon one or other of the islands.  He had come back from\r\nthe last voyage much out of health, and had been for weeks nursed by\r\nMeta, until a long rest having been declared necessary, he had been\r\nsent to England as the only place where he would not be tempted to\r\nwork, and was to visit his only remaining relation, a sister, who had\r\nmarried an officer and was in Ireland. He was burning to go back again,\r\nand eagerly explained--sagely corroborated by the testimony of the tiny\r\narchdeacon--that his illness was to be laid to the blame of his own\r\nimprudence, not to the climate; and he dwelt upon the delights of the\r\nyearly voyage among the lovely islands, beautiful beyond imagination,\r\nfenced in by coral breakwaters, within which the limpid water displayed\r\nexquisite sea-flowers, shells, and fishes of magical gorgeousness of\r\nhue; of the brilliant white beach, fringing the glorious vegetation,\r\ncocoa-nut, bread-fruit, banana, and banyan, growing on the sloping\r\nsides of volcanic rocks; of mysterious red-glowing volcano lights seen\r\nfar out at sea at night, of glades opening to show high-roofed huts\r\ncovered with mats: of canoes decorated with the shining white shells\r\nresembling a poached egg; of natives clustering round, eager and\r\nexcited, seldom otherwise than friendly; though in hitherto unvisited\r\nplaces, or in those where the wanton outrages of sandal-wood traders\r\nhad excited distrust, caution was necessary, and there was peril enough\r\nto give the voyage a full character of heroism and adventure. Bows and\r\npoisoned arrows were sometimes brought down--and Dickie insisted that\r\nthey had been used--but in general the mission was recognized, and an\r\neager welcome given; presents of fish-hooks, or of braid and\r\nhandkerchiefs, established a friendly feeling; and readiness--in which\r\nthe Hand of the Maker must be recognized--was manifested to intrust\r\nlads to the mission for the summer\'s training at the college in New\r\nZealand--wild lads, innocent of all clothing, except marvellous\r\nadornments of their woolly locks, wigged out sometimes into huge\r\ncauliflowers whitened with coral lime, or arranged quarterly red and\r\nwhite, and their noses decorated with rings, which were their nearest\r\napproach to a pocket, as they served for the suspension of fish-hooks,\r\nor any small article.  A radiate arrangement of skewers from the nose,\r\nin unwitting imitation of a cat\'s whiskers, had even been known.  A few\r\ndays taught dressing and eating in a civilized fashion; and time,\r\nexample, and the wonderful influence of the head of the mission,\r\ntrained these naturally intelligent boys into much that was hopeful.\r\nDickie, who had been often at the college, had much to tell of\r\nfamiliarity with the light canoes that some cut out and launched; of\r\nthe teaching them English games, of their orderly ways in school and in\r\nhall; of the prayers in their many tongues, and of the baptism of some,\r\nafter full probation, and at least one winter\'s return to their own\r\nisles, as a test of their sincerity and constancy.  Much as the May\r\nfamily had already heard of this wonderful work, it came all the closer\r\nand nearer now. The isle of Alan Ernescliffe\'s burial-place had now\r\nmany Christians in it.  Harry\'s friend, the young chief David, was\r\ndead; but his people were some of them already teachers and examples,\r\nand the whole region was full to overflowing of the harvest, calling\r\nout for labourers to gather it in.\r\n\r\nSilent as usual, Leonard nevertheless was listening with all his heart,\r\nand with parted lips and kindling eyes that gave back somewhat of his\r\nformer countenance.  Suddenly his face struck Mr. Seaford, and turning\r\non him with a smile, he said, \'You should be with us yourself, you look\r\ncut out for mission work.\'\r\n\r\nLeonard murmured something, blushed up to the ears, and subsided, but\r\nthe simple, single-hearted Mr. Seaford, his soul all on one object, his\r\nexperience only in one groove, by no means laid aside the thought, and\r\nthe moment he was out of Leonard\'s presence, eagerly asked who that\r\nyoung man was.\r\n\r\n\'Leonard Ward? he is--he is the son of an old friend,\' replied Dr. May,\r\na little perplexed to explain his connection.\r\n\r\n\'What is he doing?  I never saw any one looking more suited for our\r\nwork.\'\r\n\r\n\'Tell him so again,\' said Dr. May; \'I know no one that would be fitter.\'\r\n\r\nThey were all taken up with the small grandson the next day.  He was\r\nready in his fairy-page trimness to go to the early service at the\r\nMinster; but he was full of the colonial nil admirari principle, and\r\nwas quite above being struck by the grand old building, or allowing its\r\nsuperiority--either to papa\'s own church or Auckland Cathedral. They\r\ntook him to present to Mary on their way back from church, when he was\r\nthe occasion of a great commotion by carrying the precious Master\r\nCharlie all across the hall to his mamma, and quietly observing in\r\nresentment at the outcry, that of course he always carried little Ethel\r\nabout when mamma and nurse were busy.  After breakfast, when he had\r\nfinished his investigations of all Dr. May\'s domains, and much\r\nentertained Gertrude by his knowledge of them, Ethel set him down to\r\nwrite a letter to his father, and her own to Meta being engrossing, she\r\ndid not look much more after him till Dr. May came in, and said, \'I\r\nwant you to sketch off a portrait of her dicky-bird for Meta;\' and he\r\nput before her a natural history with a figure of that tiny\r\nhumming-bird which is endowed with swansdown knickerbockers.\r\n\r\n\'By the bye, where is the sprite?\'\r\n\r\nHe was not to be found; and when dinner-time, and much calling and\r\nsearching, failed to produce him, his grandfather declared that he was\r\ngone back to Elf-land; but Leonard recollected certain particular\r\ninquiries about the situation of the Grange and of Cocksmoor, and it\r\nwas concluded that he had anticipated the Doctor\'s intentions of taking\r\nhim and Mr. Seaford there in the afternoon.  The notion was confirmed\r\nby the cockatoo having likewise disappeared; but there was no great\r\nanxiety, since the little New Zealander appeared as capable of taking\r\ncare of himself as any gentleman in Her Majesty\'s dominions; and a note\r\nhad already been sent to his aunt informing her of his arrival.  Still,\r\na summons to the Doctor in an opposite direction was inopportune, the\r\nmore so as the guest was to remain at Stoneborough only this one day,\r\nand had letters and messages for Mr. and Mrs. Rivers, while it was also\r\ndesirable to see whether the boy had gone to Cocksmoor.\r\n\r\nLeonard proposed to become Mr. Seaford\'s guide to the Grange, learn\r\nwhether Dickie were there, and meet the two ladies at Cocksmoor with\r\nthe tidings, leaving Mr. Seaford and the boy to be picked up by the\r\nDoctor on his return.  It was his first voluntary offer to go anywhere,\r\nthough he had more than once been vainly invited to the Grange with\r\nRichard.\r\n\r\nMuch conversation on the mission took place during the walk, and\r\nresulted in Mr. Seaford\'s asking Leonard if his profession were\r\nsettled.  \'No,\' he said; and not at all aware that his companion did\r\nnot know what every other person round him knew, he added, \'I have been\r\nthrown out of everything--I am waiting to hear from my brother.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then you are not at a University?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh no, I was a clerk.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then if nothing is decided, is it impossible that you should turn your\r\neyes to our work?\'\r\n\r\n\'Stay,\' said Leonard, standing still; \'I must ask whether you know all\r\nabout me.  Would it be possible to admit to such work as yours one who,\r\nby a terrible mistake, has been under sentence of death and in\r\nconfinement for three years?\'\r\n\r\n\'I must think!  Let us talk of this another time.  Is that the Grange?\'\r\nhastily exclaimed the missionary, rather breathlessly. Leonard with\r\nperfect composure replied that it was, pointed out the different\r\nmatters of interest, and, though a little more silent, showed no other\r\nchange of manner.  He was asking the servant at the door if Master May\r\nwere there, when Mr. Rivers came out and conducted both into the\r\ndrawing room, where little Dickie was, sure enough.  It appeared that,\r\ncockatoo on wrist, he had put his pretty face up to the glass of Mrs\r\nRivers\'s morning-room, and had asked her, \'Is this mamma\'s room, Aunt\r\nFlora?  Where\'s Margaret?\'\r\n\r\nUncle, aunt, and cousin had all been captivated by him, and he was at\r\npresent looking at the display of all Margaret\'s treasures, keenly\r\nappreciating the useful and ingenious, but condemning the merely\r\nornamental as only fit for his baby sister.  Margaret was wonderfully\r\ngracious and child-like; but perhaps she rather oppressed him; for when\r\nLeonard explained that he must go on to meet Miss May at Cocksmoor, the\r\nlittle fellow sprang up, declaring that he wanted to go thither; and\r\nthough told that his grandfather was coming for him, and that the walk\r\nwas long, he insisted that he was not tired; and Mr. Seaford, finding\r\nhim not to be dissuaded, broke off his conversation in the midst, and\r\ninsisted on accompanying him, leaving Mr. and Mrs. Rivers rather amazed\r\nat colonial breeding.\r\n\r\nThe first time Mr. Seaford could accomplish being alone with Dr. May,\r\nhe mysteriously shut the door, and began, \'I am afraid Mrs. Rivers\r\nthought me very rude; but though no doubt he is quite harmless, I could\r\nnot let the child or the ladies be alone with him.\'\r\n\r\n\'With whom?\'\r\n\r\n\'With your patient.\'\r\n\r\n\'What patient of mine have you been seeing to-day?\' asked Dr. May, much\r\npuzzled.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, then you consider him as convalescent, and certainly he does seem\r\nrational on every other point; but is this one altogether an\r\nhallucination?\'\r\n\r\n\'I have not made out either the hallucination or the convalescent.  I\r\nbeg your pardon,\' said the courteous Doctor; \'but I cannot understand\r\nwhom you have seen.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then is not that young Ward a patient of yours?  He gave me to\r\nunderstand to-day that he has been under confinement for three years--\'\r\n\r\n\'My poor Leonard!\' exclaimed the Doctor; \'I wish his hair would grow!\r\nThis is the second time!  And did you really never hear of the Blewer\r\nmurder, and of Leonard Ward?\'\r\n\r\nMr. Seaford had some compound edifice of various murders in his mind,\r\nand required full enlightenment.  Having heard the whole, he was ardent\r\nto repair his mistake, both for Leonard\'s own sake, and that of his\r\ncause.  The young man was indeed looking ill and haggard; but there was\r\nsomething in the steady eyes, hollow though they still were, and in the\r\ndetermined cast of features, that strangely impressed the missionary\r\nwith a sense of his being moulded for the work; and on the first\r\nopportunity a simple straightforward explanation of the error was laid\r\nbefore Leonard, with an entreaty that if he had no duties to bind him\r\nat home, he would consider the need of labourers in the great harvest\r\nof the Southern Seas.\r\n\r\nLeonard made no answer save \'Thank you\' and that he would think.  The\r\ngrave set features did not light up as they had done unconsciously when\r\nlistening without personal thought; he only looked considering, and\r\naccepted Mr. Seaford\'s address in Ireland, promising to write after\r\nhearing from his brother.\r\n\r\nNext morning, Dr. May gave notice that an old patient was coming to see\r\nhim, and must be asked to luncheon.  Leonard soon after told Ethel that\r\nhe should not be at home till the evening, and she thought he was going\r\nto Cocksmoor, by way of avoiding the stranger.  In the twilight,\r\nhowever, Dr. May, going up to the station to see his patient off, was\r\nastonished to see Leonard emerge from a second-class carriage.\r\n\r\n\'You here! the last person I expected.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have only been to W---- about my teeth.\'\r\n\r\n\'What, have you been having tooth-ache?\'\r\n\r\n\'At times, but I have had two out, so I hope there is an end of it.\'\r\n\r\n\'And you never mentioned it, you Stoic!\'\r\n\r\n\'It was only at night.\'\r\n\r\n\'And how long has this been?\'\r\n\r\n\'Since I had that cold; but it was no matter.\'\r\n\r\n\'No matter, except that it kept you looking like Count Ugolino, and me\r\nalways wondering what was the matter with you.  And\'--detaining him for\r\na moment under the lights of the station--\'this extraction must have\r\nbeen a pretty business, to judge by your looks!  What did the dentist\r\ndo to you?\'\r\n\r\n\'It is not so much that\' said Leonard, low and sadly; \'but I began to\r\nhave a hope, and I see it won\'t do.\'\r\n\r\n\'What do you mean, my dear boy? what have you been doing?\'\r\n\r\n\'I have been into my old cell again,\' said he, under his breath; and\r\nDr. May, leaning on his arm, felt his nervous tremor.\r\n\r\n\'Prisoner of the Bastille, eh, Leonard!\'\r\n\r\n\'I had long been thinking that I ought to go and call on Mr. Reeve and\r\nthank him.\'\r\n\r\n\'But he does not receive calls there.\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said Leonard, as if the old impulse to confidence had returned;\r\n\'but I have never been so happy since, as I was in that cell, and I\r\nwanted to see it again.  Not only for that reason,\' he added, \'but\r\nsomething that Mr. Seaford said brought back a remembrance of what Mr.\r\nWilmot told me when my life was granted--something about the whole\r\nbeing preparation for future work--something that made me feel ready\r\nfor anything.  It had all gone from me--all but the remembrance of the\r\nsense of a blessed Presence and support in that condemned cell, and I\r\nthought perhaps ten minutes in the same place would bring it back to\r\nme.\'\r\n\r\n\'And did they?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, indeed.  As soon as the door was locked, it all went back to July\r\n1860, and worse.  Things that were mercifully kept from me then, mere\r\nabject terror of death, and of that kind of death--the disgrace--the\r\ncrowds--all came on me, and with them, the misery all in one of those\r\nnine months; the loathing of those eternal narrow waved white walls,\r\nthe sense of their closing in, the sickening of their sameness, the\r\nlonging for a voice, the other horror of thinking myself guilty.  The\r\nwarder said it was ten minutes--I thought it hours!  I was quite done\r\nfor, and could hardly get down-stairs.  I knew the spirit was being\r\ncrushed out of me by the solitary period, and it is plain that I must\r\nthink of nothing that needs nerve or presence of mind!\' he added, in a\r\ntone of quiet dejection.\r\n\r\n\'You are hardly in a state to judge of your nerve, after sleepless\r\nnights and the loss of your teeth.  Besides, there is a difference\r\nbetween the real and imaginary, as you have found; you who, in the\r\nterrible time of real anticipation, were a marvel in that very point of\r\nphysical resolution.\'\r\n\r\n\'I could keep thoughts out _then_,\' he said; \'I was master of myself.\'\r\n\r\n\'You mean that the solitude unhinged you?  Yet I always found you brave\r\nand cheerful.\'\r\n\r\n\'The sight of you made me so.  Nay, the very sight or sound of any\r\nhuman being made a difference!  And now you all treat me as if I had\r\nborne it well, but I did not.  It was all that was left me to do, but\r\nindeed I did not.\'\r\n\r\n\'What do you mean by bearing it well?\' said the Doctor, in the tone in\r\nwhich he would have questioned a patient.\r\n\r\n\'Living--as--as I thought I should when I made up my mind to life\r\ninstead of death,\' said Leonard; \'but all that went away.  I let it\r\nslip, and instead came everything possible of cowardice, and hatred,\r\nand bitterness.  I lost my hold of certainty what I had done or what I\r\nhad not, and the horror, the malice, the rebellion that used to come on\r\nme in that frightful light white silent place, were unutterable!  I\r\nwish you would not have me among you all, when I know there can hardly\r\nbe a wicked thought that did not surge over me.\'\r\n\r\n\'To be conquered.\'\r\n\r\n\'To conquer me,\' he said, in utter lassitude.\r\n\r\n\'Stay.  Did they ever make you offend wilfully?\'\r\n\r\n\'There was nothing I could offend in.\'\r\n\r\n\'Your tasks of work, for instance.\'\r\n\r\n\'I often had a savage frantic abhorrence of it, but I always brought\r\nmyself to do it, and it did me good; it would have done more if it had\r\nbeen less mechanical.  But it often was only the instinct of not\r\ndegrading myself like the lowest prisoners.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, there was your conduct to the officials.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! one could not help being amenable to them, they were so kind.\r\nBesides, these demons never came over me except when I was alone.\'\r\n\r\n\'And one thing more, Leonard; did these demons, as you well call them,\r\ninvade your devotions?\'\r\n\r\n\'Never,\' he answered readily; then recalling himself--\'not at the set\r\ntimes I mean, though they often made me think the comfort I had there\r\nmere hypocrisy and delusion, and be nearly ready to give over what\r\ndepended on myself.  Chapel was always joy; it brought change and the\r\npresence of others, if nothing else; and that would in itself have been\r\nenough to banish the hauntings.\'\r\n\r\n\'And they did not interfere with your own readings?\' said the Doctor,\r\npreferring this to the word that he meant.\r\n\r\n\'I could not let them,\' said Leonard.  \'There was always refreshment;\r\nit was only before and after that all would seem mockery, profanation,\r\nor worse still, delusion and superstition--as if my very condition\r\nproved that there was none to hear.\'\r\n\r\n\'The hobgoblin had all but struck the book out of Christian\'s hand,\'\r\nsaid Dr. May, pressing his grasp on Leonard\'s shuddering arm.  \'You are\r\nonly telling me that you have been in the valley of the shadow of\r\ndeath; you have not told me that you lost the rod and staff.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, I must have been helped, or I should not have my senses now.\'\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps it was the repressed tremor of voice and frame rather than\r\nthe actual words that induced the Doctor to reply--\'That is the very\r\npoint, Leonard.  It is the temptation to us doctors to ascribe too much\r\nto the physical and too little to the moral; and perhaps you would be\r\nmore convinced by Mr. Wilmot than by me; but I do verily believe that\r\nall the anguish you describe could and would have been insanity if\r\ngrace had not been given you to conquer it.  It was a tottering of the\r\nmind upon its balance; and, humanly speaking, it was the self-control\r\nthat enabled you to force yourself to your duties, and find relief in\r\nthem, which saved you.  I should just as soon call David conquered\r\nbecause the "deep waters had come in over his soul."\'\r\n\r\n\'You can never know how true those verses are,\' said Leonard, with\r\nanother shiver.\r\n\r\n\'At least I know to what kind of verses they all lead,\' said the\r\nDoctor; \'and I am sure they led you, and that you had more and brighter\r\nhours than you now remember.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, it was not all darkness.  I believe there were more spaces than I\r\ncan think of now, when I was very fairly happy, even at Pentonville;\r\nand at Portland all did well with me, till last spring, and then the\r\nnews from Massissauga brought back all the sense of blood-guiltiness,\r\nand it was worse than ever.\'\r\n\r\n\'And that sense was just as morbid as your other horrible doubt, about\r\nwhich you asked me when we were coming home.\'\r\n\r\n\'I see it was now, but that was the worst time of all--the monotony of\r\nschool, and the sense of hypocrisy and delusion in teaching--the\r\ncraving to confess, if only for the sake of the excitement, and the\r\nabsolute inability to certify myself whether there was any crime to\r\nconfess--I can\'t talk about it.  And even chapel was not the same\r\nrefreshment, when one was always teaching a class in it, as coming in\r\nfresh only for the service.  Even that was failing me, or I thought it\r\nwas!  No, I do not know how I could have borne it much longer.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, Leonard, you could not; Tom and I both saw that in your looks, and\r\nquite expected to hear of your being ill; but, you see, we are never\r\ntried above what we can bear!\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said Leonard, very low, as if he had been much struck; and then\r\nhe added, after an interval, \'It is over now, and there\'s no need to\r\nrecollect it except in the way of thanks.  The question is what it has\r\nleft me fit for.  You know, Dr. May,\' and his voice trembled, \'my first\r\nand best design in the happy time of Coombe, the very crown of my life,\r\nwas this very thing--to be a missionary.  But for myself, I might be in\r\ntraining now.  If I had only conquered my temper, and accepted that\r\nkind offer of Mr. Cheviot\'s, all this would never have been, and I\r\nshould have had my youth, my strength, and spirit, my best, to devote.\r\nI turned aside because of my obstinacy, against warning, and now how\r\ncan I offer?--one who has stood at the bar, lived among felons, thought\r\nsuch thoughts--the released convict with a disgraced name!  It would\r\njust be an insult to the ministry!  No, I know how prisoners feel.  I\r\ncan deal with them.  Let me go back to what I am trained for.  My nerve\r\nand spirit have been crushed out; I am fit for nothing else.  The worst\r\nthing that has remained with me is this nervousness--cowardice is its\r\nright name--starting at the sound of a door, or at a fresh face--a\r\npretty notion that I should land among savages!\'\r\n\r\nDr. May had begun an answer about the remains of the terrible ordeal\r\nthat might in itself have been part of Leonard\'s training, when they\r\nreached the house door.\r\n\r\nThese nerves, or whatever they were, did indeed seem disposed to have\r\nno mercy on their owner; for no sooner had he sat down in the warm\r\ndrawing-room, than such severe pain attacked his face as surpassed even\r\nhis powers of concealment.  Dr. May declared it was all retribution for\r\nhis unfriendliness in never seeking sympathy or advice, which might\r\nhave proved the evil to be neuralgia and saved the teeth, instead of\r\naggravating the evil by their extraction.\r\n\r\n\'I suspect he has been living on nothing,\' said Dr. May, when, in a\r\nlull of the pain, Leonard had gone to bed.\r\n\r\n\'Papa!\' exclaimed Gertrude, \'don\'t you know what Richard\'s housekeeping\r\nis?  Don\'t you recollect his taking that widow for a cook because she\r\nwas such a good woman?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think it was greatly Richard\'s fault,\' said Ethel.  \'I can\r\nhardly get Leonard to make a sparrow\'s meal here, and most likely his\r\nmouth has been too uncomfortable.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ay, that never seeking sympathy is to me one of the saddest parts of\r\nall.  He has been so long shut within himself, that he can hardly feel\r\nthat any one cares for him.\'\r\n\r\n\'He does so more than at first,\' said Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'Much more.  I have heard things from him to-night that are a\r\nrevelation to me.  Well, he has come through, and I believe he is\r\nrecovering it; but the three threads of our being have all had a\r\nterrible wrench, and if body and mind come out unscathed, it is the\r\nsoundness of the spirit that has brought them through.\'\r\n\r\nA sleepless night and morning of violent pain ensued; but, at least\r\nthus much had been gained--that there was no refusal of sympathy, but a\r\ngrateful acceptance of kindness, so that it almost seemed a recurrence\r\nto the Coombe days; and as the pain lessened, the enjoyment of Ethel\'s\r\nattendance seemed to grow upon Leonard in the gentle languor of relief;\r\nand when, as she was going out for the afternoon, she came back to see\r\nif he was comfortable in his easy-chair by the drawing-room fire, and\r\nput a screen before his face, he looked up and thanked her with a\r\nsmile--the first she had seen.\r\n\r\nWhen she returned, the winter twilight had closed in, and he was\r\nleaning back in the same attitude, but started up, so that she asked if\r\nhe had been asleep.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know--I have seen her again.\'\r\n\r\n\'Seen whom?\'\r\n\r\n\'Minna, my dear little Minna!\'\r\n\r\n\'Dreamt of her?\'\r\n\r\n\'I cannot tell,\' he said; \'I only know she was there; and then rising\r\nand standing beside Ethel, he continued--\'Miss May, you remember the\r\nnight of her death?\'\r\n\r\n\'Easter Eve?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' continued he, \'that night I saw her.\'\r\n\r\n\'I remember,\' said Ethel, \'that Mr. Wilmot told us you knew at once\r\nwhat he was come to tell you.\'\r\n\r\n\'It was soon after I was in bed, the lights were out, and I do not\r\nthink I was asleep, when she was by me--not the plump rosy thing she\r\nused to be, but tall and white, her hair short and waving back, her\r\neyes--oh! so sad and wistful, but glad too--and her hands held out--and\r\nshe said, "Turn you to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope.  O\r\nLeonard, dear, it does not hurt."\'\r\n\r\n\'It was the last thing she did say.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, so Ave\'s letter said.  And observe, one o\'clock in Indiana is\r\nhalf-past nine with us.  Then her hair--I wrote to ask, for you know it\r\nused to be in long curls, but it had been cut short, like what I saw.\r\nSurely, surely, it was the dear loving spirit allowed to show itself to\r\nme before going quite away to her home!\'\r\n\r\n\'And you have seen her again?\'\r\n\r\n\'Just now\'--his voice was even lower than before--\'since it grew dark,\r\nas I sat there.  I had left off reading, and had been thinking, when\r\nthere she was, all white but not wistful now; "Leonard, dear," she\r\nsaid, "it has not hurt;" and then, "He brought me forth, He brought me\r\nforth even to a place of liberty, because He had a favour unto me."\'\r\n\r\n\'O, Leonard, it must have made you very happy.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am very thankful for it,\' he said.  Then after a pause, \'You will\r\nnot speak of it--you will not tell me to think it the action of my own\r\nmind upon itself.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can only believe it a great blessing come to comfort you and cheer\r\nyou,\' said Ethel: \'cheer you as with the robin-note, as papa called it,\r\nthat sung all through the worst of times!  Leonard, I am afraid you\r\nwill think it unkind of me to have withheld it so long, but papa told\r\nme you could not yet bear to hear of Minna.  I have her last present\r\nfor you in charge--the slippers she was working for that eighteenth\r\nbirthday of yours.  She would go on, and we never knew whether she\r\nfully understood your danger; it was always "they could not hurt you,"\r\nand at last, when they were finished, and I had to make her understand\r\nthat you could not have them, she only looked up to me and said,\r\n"Please keep them, and give them to him when he comes home."  She never\r\ndoubted, first or last.\'\r\n\r\nEthel, who had daily been watching for the moment, took out the parcel\r\nfrom the drawer, with the address in the childish writing, the date in\r\nher own.\r\n\r\nLarge tears came dropping from Leonard\'s eyes, as he undid the paper,\r\nand looked at the work, then said, \'Last time I saw that pattern, my\r\nmother was working it!  Dear child!  Yes, Miss May, I am glad you did\r\nnot give them to me before.  I always felt as if my blow had glanced\r\naside and fallen on Minna; but somehow I feel more fully how happy she\r\nis!\'\r\n\r\n\'She was the messenger of comfort throughout to Ave and to Ella,\' said\r\nEthel, \'and well she may be to you still.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have dreaded to ask,\' said Leonard; \'but there was a line in one\r\nletter I was shown that made me believe that climate was not the whole\r\ncause.\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said Ethel; \'at least the force to resist it had been lost, as\r\nfar as we can see.  It was a grievous error of your brother\'s to think\r\nher a child who could forget.  She pined to hear of you, and that one\r\nconstant effort of faith and love was too much, and wasted away the\r\nlittle tender body.  But oh, Leonard, how truly she can say that her\r\ncaptivity is over, and that it has not hurt!\'\r\n\r\n\'It has not hurt,\' musingly repeated Leonard.  \'No, she is beyond the\r\nreach of distracting temptations and sorrows; it has only made her\r\nbrighter to have suffered what it breaks one\'s heart to think of.  It\r\nhas not hurt.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothing from without does hurt!\' said Ethel, \'unless one lets it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hurt what?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'The soul,\' returned Ethel.  \'Mind and body may be hurt, and it is not\r\npossible to know one\'s mind from one\'s soul while one is alive, but as\r\nlong as the will and faith are right, to think the soul can be hurt\r\nseems to me like doubting our Protector.\'\r\n\r\n\'But if the will have been astray?\'\r\n\r\n\'Then while we repent, we must not doubt our Redeemer.\'\r\n\r\nDickie ran in at the moment, calling for Aunt Ethel.  She had dropped\r\nher muff.  Leonard picked it up, and as she took it, he wrung her hand\r\nwith an earnestness that showed his gratitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n  Tender as woman; manliness and meekness\r\n         In him were so allied,\r\n  That those who judged him by his strength or weakness,\r\n         Knew but a single side.--J. WHITTIER\r\n\r\n\r\nIt promised to be a brilliant Christmas at Stoneborough, though little\r\nDickie regarded the feast coming in winter as a perverse English\r\ninnovation, and was grand on the superiority of supple jack above\r\nholly.  Decorations had been gradually making their way into the\r\nMinster, and had advanced from being just tolerated to being absolutely\r\ndelighted in; but Dr. Spencer, with his knack of doing everything, was\r\nsorely missed as a head, and Mr. Wilmot insisted that the May forces\r\nshould come down and work the Minster, on the 23rd, leaving the Eve for\r\nthe adornment of Cocksmoor, after the return of its incumbent.  Mary,\r\nalways highly efficient in that line, joined them; and Leonard\'s\r\nhandiness and dexterity in the arts relating to carpentry were as\r\nquietly useful as little Dickie\'s bright readiness in always handing\r\nwhatever was wanting.\r\n\r\nThe work was pretty well over, when Aubrey, who had just arrived with\r\nleave for a week, came down, and made it desultory.  Dickie, whose\r\nimagination had been a good deal occupied by his soldier uncle, wanted\r\nto study him, and Gertrude was never steady when Aubrey was near.\r\nPresently it was discovered that the door to the tower stair was open.\r\nThe ascent of the tower was a feat performed two or three times in a\r\nlifetime at Stoneborough.  Harry had once beguiled Ethel and Mary up,\r\nbut Gertrude had never gone, and was crazy to go, as was likewise\r\nDickie.  Moreover, Aubrey and Gertrude insisted that it was only proper\r\nthat Ethel should pay her respects to her prototype the gurgoyle, they\r\nwanted to compare her with him, and ordered her up; in fact their\r\nspirits were too high for them to be at ease within the church, and\r\nEthel, maugre her thirty years, partook of the exhilaration enough to\r\ndelight in an extraordinary enterprise, and as nothing remained but a\r\nlittle sweeping up, they left this to the superintendence of Mary and\r\nMr. Wilmot, and embarked upon the narrow crumbling steps of the spiral\r\nstair, that led up within an unnatural thickening of one of the great\r\npiers that supported the tower, at the intersection of nave and\r\ntransepts.  After a long period of dust and darkness, and the monotony\r\nof always going with the same leg foremost, came a narrow door, leading\r\nto the ringers\' region, with all their ropes hanging down.  Ethel was\r\nthankful when she had got her youngsters past without an essay on them;\r\nshe doubted if she should have succeeded, but for Leonard\'s being an\r\nelement of soberness.  Other little doors ensued, leading out to the\r\nvarious elevations of roof, which were at all sorts of different\r\nheights, the chancel lower than the nave, and one transept than the\r\nother; besides that the nave had both triforium and clerestory.  It was\r\na sort of labyrinth, and they wondered whether any one, except perhaps\r\nthe plumber\'s foreman knew his way among all the doors.  Then there was\r\none leading inwards to the eight bells--from whose fascinations Ethel\r\nthought Dickie never would be taken away--and still more charming, to\r\nthe clock, which clanged a tremendous three, as they were in the act of\r\nlooking at it, causing Leonard to make a great start, and then colour\r\npainfully.  It was hard to believe, as Daisy said, that the old tower,\r\nthat looked so short and squat below, could be so very high when you\r\ncame to go up it; but the glimpses of the country, through the little\r\nloop-hole windows, were most inviting.  At last, Aubrey, who was\r\nforemost, pushed up the trap-door, and emerged; but, as Dickie followed\r\nhim, exclaimed, \'Here we are; but you ladies in crinolines will never\r\nfollow!  You\'ll stick fast for ever, and Leonard can\'t pass, so there\r\nyou\'ll all have to stay.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aunt Daisy will sail away like a balloon,\' added Dickie, roguishly,\r\nlooking back at her, and holding on his cap.\r\n\r\nBut Gertrude vigorously compressed her hoop, and squeezed through,\r\nfollowed by Ethel and Leonard.  There was a considerable space, square,\r\nleaded and protected by the battlemented parapet, with a deep moulding\r\nround, and a gutter resulting in the pipe smoked by Ethel\'s likeness,\r\nthe gurgoyle.  Of course the first thing Dickie and Aubrey did was to\r\nlook for the letters that commemorated the ascent of H. M., E. M., M.\r\nM., in 1852; and it was equally needful that R. R. M., if nobody else,\r\nshould likewise leave a record on the leads.  There was an R. M. of\r\n1820, that made it impossible to gainsay him.  The view was not grand\r\nin itself, but there was a considerable charm in looking down on the\r\nrooks in their leafless trees, cawing over their old nests, and in\r\nseeing the roofs of the town; far away, too, the gray Welsh hills, and\r\nbetween, the country lying like a map, with rivers traced in light\r\ninstead of black.  Leonard stood still, his face turned towards the\r\ngreenest of the meadows, and the river where it dashed over the wheel\r\nof a mill.\r\n\r\n\'Have you seen it again?\' asked Ethel, as she stood by him, and watched\r\nhis eye.\r\n\r\n\'No.  I am rather glad to see it first from so far off,\' he answered,\r\n\'I mean to walk over some day.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ethel,\' called Gertrude, \'is this your gurgoyle?  His profile, as seen\r\nfrom above, isn\'t flattering.\'\r\n\r\n\'O, Daisy, don\'t lean over so far.\'\r\n\r\n\'Quite safe;\' but at that instant a gust of wind caught her hat, she\r\ngrasped at it, but only saved it from whirling away, and made it fall\r\nshort.  \'There, Ethel, your image has put on my hat; and henceforth\r\nwill appear to the wondering city in a black hat and feather!\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll get it,\' exclaimed the ever ready Dickie; and in another moment\r\nhe had mounted the parapet and was reaching for it.  Whether it were\r\nGertrude\'s shriek, or the natural recoil away from the grasping hand,\r\nor that his hold on the side of the adjoining pinnacle was insecure, he\r\nlost his balance, and with a sudden cry, vanished from their eyes.\r\n\r\nThe frightful consternation of that moment none of those four could\r\never bear to recall; the next, they remembered that he could only fall\r\nas far as the roof, but it was Ethel and Leonard alone who durst press\r\nto the parapet, and at the same moment a cry came up--\r\n\r\n\'Oh, come!  I\'m holding on, but it cuts!  Oh, come!\'\r\n\r\nEthel saw, some five-and-twenty feet below, the little boy upon the\r\ntransept roof, a smooth slope of lead, only broken by a skylight, a bit\r\nof churchwarden\'s architecture still remaining.  The child had gone\r\ncrashing against the window, and now lay back clinging to its iron\r\nframe.  Behind him was the entire height within to the church floor,\r\nbefore him a rapid slope, ended by a course of stone, wide enough\r\nindeed to walk on, but too narrow to check the impetus from slipping\r\ndown the inclination above.  Ethel\'s brain swam; she just perceived\r\nthat both Aubrey and Leonard had disappeared, and then had barely power\r\nto support Gertrude, who reeled against her, giddy with horror.  \'Oh\r\nlook, look, Ethel,\' she cried; \'I can\'t.  Where is he?\'\r\n\r\n\'There!  Yes, hold on, Dickie, they are coming.  Look up--not\r\ndown--hold on!\'\r\n\r\nA door opened, and out dashed Aubrey!  Alas! it was on the nave\r\nclerestory; he might as well have been a hundred, miles off.  Another\r\ndoor, and Leonard appeared, and on the right level, but with a giddy\r\nunguarded ridge on which to pass round the angle of the tower. She saw\r\nhis head pass safely round, but, even then, the horror was not over.\r\nCould he steady himself sufficiently to reach the child, or might not\r\nDickie lose hold too soon?  It was too close below for sight, the\r\nmoulding and gurgoyle impeded her agonized view, but she saw the\r\nchild\'s look of joyful relief, she heard the steady voice, \'Wait, don\'t\r\nlet go yet.  There,\' and after a few more sounds, came up a shout, \'all\r\nright!\' Infinitely relieved, she had to give her whole attention to\r\npoor Gertrude, who, overset by the accident, giddy with the attempt to\r\nlook over, horrified by the danger, confused and distressed by the hair\r\nthat came wildly flapping about her head and face, and by the puffs of\r\nwind at her hoop, had sunk down in the centre of the little leaden\r\nsquare, clinging with all her might to the staff of the weathercock,\r\nand feeling as if the whole tower were rocking with her, absolutely\r\nseeing the battlements dance.  How was she ever to be safely got down\r\nthe rickety ladder leading to the crumbling stone stair?  Ethel knelt\r\nby her, twisted up the fluttering hair, bade her shut her eyes and\r\ncompose her thoughts, and then called over the battlements to Aubrey,\r\nwho, confused by the shock, continued to emerge at wrong doors and lose\r\nhimself on the roofs, and was like one in a bad dream, nearly as much\r\ndizzied as his sister, to whose help he came the more readily, as the\r\nway up was the only one plain before him.\r\n\r\nThe detention would have been more dreadful to Ethel had she known all\r\nthat was passing below, and that when the little boy, at Leonard\'s\r\nsign, lowered himself towards the out-reaching arms of the young man,\r\nwho was steadying himself against the wall of the tower, it was with a\r\nlook of great pain, and leaving a trail of blood behind him.  When, at\r\nlength, he stood at the angle, Leonard calmly said, \'Now go before me,\r\nround that corner, in at the door.  Hold by the wall, I\'ll hold your\r\nshoulder.\'  The boy implicitly obeyed, the notion of giddiness never\r\nseemed to occur to him, and both safely came to the little door, on the\r\nthreshold of which Leonard sat down, and lifting him on his knee, asked\r\nwhere he was hurt?  \'My leg,\' said Dickie, \'the glass was running in\r\nall the time, and I could not move; but it does not hurt so much now.\'\r\n\r\nPerhaps not; but a large piece of glass had broken into the slender\r\nlittle calf, and Leonard steadied himself to withdraw it, as, happily,\r\nthe fragment was large enough to give a hold for his hand. The sensible\r\nlittle fellow, without a word, held up the limb across Leonard\'s knee,\r\nand threw an arm round his neck, to hold himself still, just saying,\r\n\'Thank you,\' when it was over.\r\n\r\n\'Did it hurt much, Dickie?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not very much,\' he answered; \'but how it bleeds!  Where\'s Aunt Ethel?\'\r\n\r\n\'On the tower.  She will come in a moment,\' said Leonard, startled by\r\nthe exceeding flow of blood, and binding the gash round with his\r\nhandkerchief.  \'Now, I\'ll carry you down.\'\r\n\r\nThe boy did not speak all the weary winding way down the dark stairs;\r\nbut Leonard heard gasps of oppression, and felt the head lean on his\r\nshoulder; moreover, a touch convinced him that the handkerchief was\r\nsoaking, nay dripping, and when he issued at length into the free air\r\nof the church, the face was deadly white.  No one was near, and Leonard\r\nlaid him on a bench.  He was still conscious, and looked up with\r\nlanguid eyes. \'Mayn\'t I go home?\' he said, faintly; \'Aunt Ethel!\'\r\n\r\n\'Let me try to stop this bleeding first,\' said Leonard.  \'My dear\r\nlittle man, if you will only be quiet, I think I can.\'\r\n\r\nLeonard took the handkerchief from his throat, and wound it to its\r\ntightest just above the hurt, Dickie remonstrating for a moment with,\r\n\'That\'s not the place.  It is too tight.\'\r\n\r\n\'It will cut off the blood from coming,\' said Leonard; and in the same\r\nunderstanding way, the child submitted, feebly asking, \'Shall I bleed\r\nto death?  Mamma will be so sorry!\'\r\n\r\n\'I trust--I hope not,\' said Leonard; he durst utter no encouragement,\r\nfor the life-blood continued to pour forth unchecked, and the next\r\nmurmur was, \'I\'m so sick.  I can\'t say my prayers.  Papa!  Mamma!\'\r\nAlready, however, Leonard had torn down a holly bough, and twisted off\r\n(he would have given worlds for a knife) a short stout stick, which he\r\nthrust into one of the folds of the ligature, and pulled it much\r\ntighter, so that his answer was, \'Thank God, Dickie, that will do! the\r\nbleeding has stopped.  You must not mind if it hurts for a little\r\nwhile.\'\r\n\r\nAn ejaculation of \'Poor little dear,\' here made him aware of the\r\npresence of the sexton\'s wife; but in reply to her offer to carry him\r\nin to Mrs. Cheviot\'s, Dickie faintly answered, \'Please let me go home;\'\r\nand Leonard, \'Yes, I will take him home.  Tell Miss May it is a cut\r\nfrom the glass, I am taking him to have it dressed, and will bring him\r\nhome.  Now, my dear little patient fellow, can you put your arms round\r\nmy neck?\'\r\n\r\nSensible, according to both meanings of the word, Dickie clasped his\r\nfriend\'s neck, and laid his head on his shoulder, not speaking again\r\ntill he found Leonard was not turning towards the High Street, when he\r\nsaid, \'That is not the way home.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, Dickie, but we must get your leg bound up directly, and the\r\nhospital is the only place where we can be sure of finding any one to\r\ndo it.  I will take you home directly afterwards.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you,\' said the courteous little gentleman; and in a few minutes\r\nmore Leonard had rung the bell, and begged the house surgeon would come\r\nat once to Dr. May\'s grandson.  A few drops of stimulant much revived\r\nDickie, and he showed perfect trust and composure, only holding\r\nLeonard\'s hands, and now and then begging to know what they were doing,\r\nwhile he was turned over on his face for the dressing of the wound,\r\nbearing all without a sound, except an occasional sobbing gasp,\r\naccompanied by a squeeze of Leonard\'s finger.  Just as this business\r\nhad been completed, the surgeon exclaimed, \'There\'s Dr. May\'s step,\'\r\nand Dickie at once sat up, as his grandfather hurried in, nearly as\r\npale as the boy himself.  \'O, grandpapa, never mind, it is almost well\r\nnow; and has Aunt Daisy got her hat?\'\r\n\r\n\'What is it, my dear? what have you been doing?\' said the Doctor,\r\nlooking in amazement from the boy to Leonard, who was covered with\r\nblood.  \'They told me you had fallen off the Minster tower!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes I did,\' said Dickie; \'I reached after Aunt Daisy\'s hat, but I fell\r\non the roof, and I was sliding, sliding down to the wall, but there was\r\na window, and the glass broke and cut me, but I got my feet against the\r\nbottom of it, and held on by the iron bar, till Leonard came and took\r\nme down;\' and he lay back on the pillow, quiet and exhausted, but\r\nbright-eyed and attentive as ever, listening to Leonard\'s equally brief\r\nversion of the adventure.\r\n\r\n\'Didn\'t he save my life, grandpapa?\' said the boy, at the close.\r\n\r\n\'Twice over, you may say,\' added the surgeon, and his words as to the\r\nnature of the injury manifested that all had depended on the immediate\r\nstoppage of the haemorrhage.  With so young a child, delay from\r\nindecision or want of resource would probably have been fatal.\r\n\r\n\'There would have been no doing anything, if this little man had not\r\nbeen so good and sensible,\' said Leonard, leaning over him.\r\n\r\n\'And I did not cry.  You will tell papa I did not cry,\' said Dickie,\r\neagerly, but only half gratified by such girlish treatment as that\r\nagitated kiss of his grandfather, after being a little bit of a hero;\r\nbut then Dickie\'s wondering eyes really beheld such another kiss\r\nbestowed over his head upon Leonard, and quite thought there were tears\r\non grandpapa\'s cheeks.  Perhaps old gentlemen could do what was\r\nchildish in little boys.\r\n\r\nDickie was to be transported home.  He wished to be carried by Leonard,\r\nbut the brougham was at the door, and he had to content himself with\r\nbeing laid on the seat, with his friend to watch over him, the Doctor\r\npointing out that Leonard was a savage spectacle for the eyes of\r\nStoneborough, and hurrying home by the short cut.  Ethel met him in\r\nextreme alarm.  Gertrude\'s half-restored senses had been totally\r\nscattered by the sight of the crimson traces on the spot of Leonard\'s\r\noperations, and she had been left to Mary\'s care; while Ethel and\r\nAubrey had hastened home, and not finding any one there, the latter had\r\ndashed off to Bankside, whilst Ethel waited, arranging the little\r\nfellow\'s bed, and trying to trust to Leonard\'s message, and not let her\r\nmind go back to that fearful day of like waiting, sixteen years ago,\r\nnor on to what she might have to write to Norman and Meta of the charge\r\nthey had sent to her.  Her father\'s cheerful face at first was a pang,\r\nand then came the rebound of gladness at the words.  \'He is coming.  No\r\nfear for him, gallant little man--thanks for God\'s mercy, and to that\r\nnoble fellow, Leonard.\'\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Aubrey burst in--\'No one at Wright\'s--won\'t be in no\r\none knows how long!  What is to become of us?\'  And he sank down on a\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\'Ay, what would become of any of us, if no one had a better pate than\r\nyours, sir?\' said Dr. May.  \'You have one single perfection, and you\r\nhad better make the most of it--that of knowing how to choose your\r\nfriends.  There\'s the carriage.\'\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\'s delay, the cushion was lifted out with the little\r\nwounded cavalier, still like a picture; for, true to his humming-bird\r\nnature, a few scarcely-conscious movements of his hands had done away\r\nwith looks of disarray--the rich glossy curls were scarcely disordered,\r\nand no stains of blood had adhered to the upper part of his small\r\nperson, whereas Leonard was a ghastly spectacle from head to foot.\r\n\r\n\'So, Master Dicky-bird,\' said Dr. May, as they rested him a moment on\r\nthe hall-table, \'give me that claw of yours.  Yes, you\'ll do very well,\r\nonly you must go to bed now; and, mind, whatever you did when you were\r\nin Fairy-land, we don\'t fly here in Stoneborough--and it does not\r\nanswer.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am not to go to bed for being naughty, am I?\' said Dickie, his brave\r\nwhite lip for the first time quivering; \'indeed, I did not know it was\r\nwrong.\'\r\n\r\nThe poor little man\'s spirits were so exhausted, that the reassurance\r\non this head absolutely brought the much-dreaded tears into his eyes;\r\nand he could only be carried up gently to his bed, and left to be\r\nundressed by his aunt, so great an aggravation to the troubles of this\r\nsmall fragment of independence, that it had almost overset his courtesy\r\nand self-command.  There was no contenting him till he had had all\r\ntraces of the disaster washed from face and hands, and the other foot;\r\nand then, over his tea, though his little clear chirrup was weak, he\r\nmust needs give a lucid description of Leonard\'s bandaging, in the\r\nmidst of which came a knock at the door, and a gasping voice--\'I\'ll be\r\nquite quiet--indeed I will!  Only just let me come in and kiss him, and\r\nsee that he is safe.\'\r\n\r\n\'O, Auntie Daisy, have you got your hat?\'\r\n\r\nWan, tear-stained, dishevelled, Gertrude bit her lip to save an\r\noutburst, gave the stipulated kiss, and retreated to Mary, who stood in\r\nthe doorway like a dragon.\r\n\r\n\'Auntie Daisy has been crying,\' said Dickie, turning his eyes back to\r\nEthel.  \'Please tell her I shall be well very soon, and then I\'ll go up\r\nagain and try to get her hat, if I may have a hook and line--I\'ll tell\r\nyou how.\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear Dickie, you had better lie down, and settle it as you go to\r\nsleep,\' said Ethel, her flesh creeping at the notion of his going up\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\'But if I go to sleep now, I shall not know when to say my prayers.\'\r\n\r\n\'Had you not better do so now, Dickie?\'\r\n\r\nNext came the child\'s scruple about not kneeling; but at last he was\r\nsatisfied, if Aunt Ethel would give him his little book out of the\r\ndrawer--that little delicately-illuminated book with the pointed\r\nwriting and the twisted cipher, Meta\'s hand in every touch. Presently\r\nhe looked up, and said: \'Aunt Ethel, isn\'t there a verse somewhere\r\nabout giving the angels charge?  I want you to find it for me, for I\r\nthink they helped me to hold on, and helped Leonard upon the narrow\r\nplace.  You know they are sure to be flying about the church.\'\r\n\r\nEthel read the ninety-first Psalm to him.  He listened all through, and\r\nthanked her; but in a few minutes more he was fast asleep.  As she left\r\nthe room she met Leonard coming down and held out her hands to him with\r\na mute intensity of thanks, telling him, in a low voice, what Dickie\r\nhad said of the angels\' care.\r\n\r\n\'I am sure it was true,\' said Leonard.  \'What else could have saved the\r\nbrave child from dizziness?\'\r\n\r\nDown-stairs Leonard\'s reception from Dr. May was, \'Pretty well for a\r\nnervous man!\'\r\n\r\n\'Anybody can do what comes to hand.\'\r\n\r\n\'I beg your pardon.  Some bodies lose their wits, like your friend\r\nAubrey, who tells me, if he had stood still, he would have fainted\r\naway.  As long as nerves can do what comes to hand, they need not be\r\nblamed, even if they play troublesome tricks at other times, as I\r\nsuspect they are doing now.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; my face is aching a little.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not to say a great deal,\' said the Doctor.  \'Well, I am not going to\r\npity you; for I think you can feel to-day that most of us would be glad\r\nto be in your place!\'\r\n\r\n\'I am very glad,\' said Leonard.\r\n\r\n\'You remember that child\'s parents?  No, you have grown so old, that I\r\nam always forgetting what a boy you ought to be; but if you had ever\r\nseen the tenderness of his father, and that sunbeam of a Meta, you\r\nwould know all the more how we bless you for what you have spared them.\r\nLeonard, if anything had been needed to do so, you have won to yourself\r\nsuch a brother in Norman as you have in Aubrey!\'\r\n\r\nMeantime Ethel was soothing Gertrude, to whom the shock had been in\r\nproportion to the triumphal heights of her careless gaiety.  Charles\r\nCheviot had come in while his wife was restoring her; and he had\r\nplainly said what no one else would have intimated to the spoilt\r\ndarling--that the whole accident had been owing to her recklessness,\r\nand that he had always expected some fatal consequences to give her a\r\nlesson!\r\n\r\nGertrude had been fairly cowed by such unwonted treatment; and when he\r\nwould only take her home on condition of composure and self-command,\r\nher trembling limbs obliged her to accept his arm, and he subdued her\r\ninto meek silence, and repression of all agitation, till she was safe\r\nin her room, when she took a little bit of revenge upon Mary by crying\r\nher heart out, and declaring it was very cruel of Charles, when she did\r\nnot mean it.\r\n\r\nAnd Mary, on her side, varied between assurances that Charles did not\r\nmean it, and that he was quite right--the sister now predominating in\r\nher, and now the wife.\r\n\r\n\'Mean what?\' said Ethel, sitting down among them before they were aware.\r\n\r\n\'That--that it was all my fault!\' burst out Gertrude.  \'If it was, I\r\ndon\'t see what concern it is of his!\'\r\n\r\n\'But, Daisy dear, he is your brother!\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve got plenty of brothers of my own!  I don\'t count those\r\npeople-in-law--\'\r\n\r\n\'She\'s past reasoning with, Mary,\' said Ethel.  \'Leave her to me; she\r\nwill come to her senses by and by!\'\r\n\r\n\'But indeed, Ethel, you won\'t be hard on her?  I am sure dear Charles\r\nnever thought what he said would have been taken in this way.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why did he say it then?\' cried Gertrude, firing up.\r\n\r\n\'My dear Mary, do please go down, before we get into the pitiable\r\nlast-word condition!\'\r\n\r\nThat condition was reached already; but in Ethel\'s own bed-room Mary\'s\r\nimplicit obedience revived, and away she went, carrying off with her\r\nmost of what was naughtiness in Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\'Ethel--Ethel dear!\' cried she at once, \'I know you are coming down on\r\nme.  I deserve it all, only Charles had no business to say it. And\r\nwasn\'t it very cruel and unkind when he saw the state I was in?\'\r\n\r\n\'I suppose Charles thought it was the only chance of giving a lesson,\r\nand therefore true kindness.  Come, Daisy, is this terrible fit of\r\npride a proper return for such a mercy as we have had to-day?\'\r\n\r\n\'If I didn\'t say so to myself a dozen times on the way home!--only Mary\r\ncame and made me so intolerably angry, by expecting me to take it as if\r\nit had come from you or papa.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, Daisy, that is the evil!  If I had done my duty by you all, this\r\nwould not have been!\'\r\n\r\n\'Now, Ethel, when you want to be worse, and more cutting than anything,\r\nyou go and tell me my faults are yours!  For pity\'s sake, don\'t come to\r\nthat!\'\r\n\r\n\'But I must, Daisy, for it is true.  Oh, if you had only been a naughty\r\nlittle girl!\'\r\n\r\n\'What--and had it out then?\' said Daisy, who was lying across the bed,\r\nand put her golden head caressingly on Ethel\'s knee.  \'If I had plagued\r\nyou then, you would have broken me in out of self-defence.\'\r\n\r\n\'Something like it,\' said Ethel.  \'But you know, Daisy, the little last\r\ntreasure that mamma left did always seem something we could not make\r\nenough of, and it didn\'t make you fractious or tiresome--at least not\r\nto us--till we thought you could not be spoilt.  And then I didn\'t see\r\nthe little faults so soon as I ought; and I\'m only an elder sister,\r\nafter all, without any authority.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, you\'re not to say that, Ethel, I mind your authority, and always\r\nwill.  You are never a bother.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, that\'s it, Daisy!  If I had only been a bother, you might never\r\nhave got ahead of yourself.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then you really think, like Charles Cheviot, that it was my doing,\r\nEthel?\'\r\n\r\n\'What do you think yourself?\'\r\n\r\nGreat tears gathered in the corners of the blue eyes.  Was it weak in\r\nEthel not to bear the sight?\r\n\r\n\'My poor Daisy,\' she said, \'yours is not all the burden!  I ought not\r\nto have taken up such a giddy company, or else I should have kept the\r\nboy under my hand.  But he is so discreet and independent, that it is\r\nmore like having a gentleman staying in the house, than a child under\r\none\'s charge; and one forgets how little he is; and I was as much off\r\nmy balance with spirits as you.  It was the flightiness of us all; and\r\nwe have only to be thankful, and to be sobered for another time. I am\r\nafraid the pride about being reproved is really the worse fault.\'\r\n\r\n\'And what do you want me to do?--to go and tell papa all about it? I\r\nmean to do that, of course; it is the only way to get comforted.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course it is; but--\'\r\n\r\n\'You horrid creature, Ethel!  I\'ll never say you aren\'t a bother again.\r\nYou really do want me to go and tell Charles Cheviot that he was quite\r\nright, and Mary that I\'m ready to be trampled on by all my\r\nbrothers-in-law in a row!  Well, there won\'t be any more.  You\'ll never\r\ngive me one--that\'s one comfort!\' said Gertrude, wriggling herself up,\r\nand flinging an arm round Ethel\'s neck.  \'As long as you don\'t do that,\r\nI\'ll do anything for you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not for me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, you know that, you old thing! only you might take it as a\r\npersonal compliment.  I really will do it; for, of course, one could\r\nnot keep one\'s Christmas otherwise!\'  It was rather too business-like;\r\nbut elders are often surprised to find what was a hard achievement in\r\ntheir time a matter of course to their pupils--almost lightly passed\r\nover.\r\n\r\nDickie slept till morning, when he was found very pale, but lively and\r\ngood-humoured as ever.  Mr. Wright, coming up to see him, found the\r\nhurt going on well, and told Ethel, that if she could keep him in bed\r\nand undisturbed for the day, it would be better and safer; but that if\r\nhe became restless and fretful, there would be no great risk in taking\r\nhim to a sofa.  Restless and fretful!  Mr. Wright little knew the\r\ndiscretion, or the happy power of accommodation to circumstances, that\r\nhad descended to Meta\'s firstborn.\r\n\r\nHe was quite resigned as soon as the explanation had been\r\nmade--perhaps, indeed, there was an instinctive sense, that to be\r\ndressed and moved would be fatiguing; but he had plenty of smiles and\r\nanimation for his visitors, and, when propped up in bed, was full of\r\ndevices for occupation.  Moreover he acquired a slave; he made a\r\nregular appropriation of Leonard, whom he quickly perceived to be the\r\nmost likely person to assist in his great design of constructing a\r\nmodel of the clock in the Minster tower, for the edification of his\r\nlittle brother Harry.  Leonard worked away at the table by the bed-side\r\nwith interest nearly equal to the child\'s; and when wire and cardboard\r\nwere wanting, he put aside all his dislike to facing the Stoneborough\r\nstreets and tradesmen in open day, and, at Dickie\'s request, sallied\r\nforth in quest of the materials.  And when the bookseller made\r\ninquiries after the boy, Leonard, in the fulness of his heart, replied\r\nfreely and in detail--nay, he was so happy in the little man\'s\r\nwell-doing, that he was by no means disconcerted even by a full\r\nencounter of Mrs. Harvey Anderson in the street, but answered all her\r\ninquiries, in entire oblivion of all but the general rejoicing in\r\nlittle Dickie\'s wonderful escape.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said Aubrey to his sisters, after a visit to his nephew\'s room,\r\n\'Dickie has the best right to him, certainly, to-day.  It is an\r\nabsolute appropriation!  They were talking away with all their might\r\nwhen I came up, but came to a stop when I went in, and Master Dick sent\r\nme to the right-about.\'\r\n\r\nThe truth was, that Dickie, who, with eyes and ears all alive, had\r\ngathered up some fragments of Leonard\'s history, had taken this\r\nopportunity of catechizing him upon it in a manner that it was\r\nimpossible to elude, and which the child\'s pretty tact carried off, as\r\nit did many things which would not have been tolerated if done rudely\r\nand abruptly.  Step by step, in the way of question and remark, he led\r\nLeonard to tell him all that had happened; and when once fairly\r\nembarked in the reminiscence, there was in it a kind of peace and\r\npleasure.  The fresh, loving, wondering sympathy of the little boy was\r\nunspeakably comforting; and besides, the bringing the facts in their\r\nsimple form to the grasp of the childish mind, restored their\r\nproportion, which their terrible consequences had a good deal\r\ndisturbed.  They seemed to pass from the present to the historical, and\r\nto assume the balance that they took in the child\'s mind, coming newly\r\nupon them.  It was like bathing in a clear limpid stream, that washed\r\naway the remains of morbid oppression.\r\n\r\n\'I wish mamma was here,\' said the little friend, at last.\r\n\r\n\'Do you want her?  Are you missing her, my dear?\'\r\n\r\n\'I miss her always,\' said Dickie.  \'But it was not that--only mamma\r\nalways makes everybody so happy; and she would be so fond of you,\r\nbecause you have had so much trouble.\'\r\n\r\n\'But, Dickie, don\'t you think I am happy to be with your grandfather\r\nand aunt, and hoping to see my own sisters very soon--your aunt, who\r\ntaught me what bore me through it all?\'\r\n\r\n\'Aunt Ethel?\' cried Dickie, considering.  \'I like Aunt Ethel very much;\r\nbut then she is not like mamma!\'\r\n\r\nThere could be no doubt that Leonard was much better and happier after\r\nthis adventure.  Reluctantly, Dickie let him go back to Cocksmoor,\r\nwhere his services in church-decking and in singing had been too much\r\ndepended on to be dispensed with; but he was to come back with Richard\r\nfor the family assembly on Christmas evening.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Gertrude, who was quite herself again, having made her peace\r\nwith the Cheviots, and endured the reception of her apologies, seized\r\non him to lay plots for a Christmas-tree, for the delectation of Dickie\r\non his sofa, and likewise of Margaret Rivers, and of the elite of the\r\nCocksmoor schools.  He gave in to it heartily, and on the appointed day\r\nworked with great spirit at the arrangements in the dining-room, where\r\nGertrude, favoured by the captive state of the little boy, conducted\r\nher preparations, relegating the family meals to the schoolroom.\r\n\r\nThis tree was made the occasion for furnishing Leonard with all the\r\nlittle appliances of personal property that had been swept away from\r\nhim; and, after all, he was the most delighted of the party.  The small\r\nCharlie Cheviot had to be carried off shrieking; Margaret Rivers was\r\ncritical; even Cocksmoor was experienced in Christmas-trees; and\r\nDickie, when placed in the best situation, and asked if such trees grew\r\nin New Zealand, made answer that he helped mamma to make one every year\r\nfor the Maori children.  It was very kind in Aunt Daisy, he added, with\r\nunfailing courtesy; but he was too zealous for his colony to be\r\ndazzled--too utilitarian to be much gratified by any of his gifts,\r\nexcepting a knife of perilous excellence, which Aubrey, in contempt of\r\nStoneborough productions, had sacrificed from his own pocket at the\r\nlast moment.\r\n\r\nLeonard and Dickie together were in a state of great delight at the\r\nlittle packets handed to the former; studs, purse, pencil-case, writing\r\nmaterials; from Hector Ernescliffe, a watch, with the entreaty that his\r\ngifts might not be regarded as unlucky; from Ethel, a photographic\r\nbook, with the cartes of his own family, whose old negatives had been\r\nhunted up for the purpose; also a recent one of Dr. May with his\r\ngrandson on his knee, the duplicate of which was gone to New Zealand,\r\nwith the Doctor\'s inscription, \'The modern Cyropaedia, Astyages\r\nconfounded.\'  There was Richard, very good, young and pretty; there was\r\nEthel, exactly like the Doctor, \'only more so;\' there was Gertrude,\r\nlike nobody, not even herself, and her brothers much in the same\r\npredicament, there was the latest of Mr. Rivers\'s many likenesses, with\r\nthe cockatoo on his wrist, and there was the least truculent and\r\nwitchlike of the numerous attempts on Flora; there was Mrs. Cheviot,\r\nbroad-faced and smiling over her son, and Mr. and Mrs. Ernescliffe,\r\npinioning the limbs of their offspring, as in preparation for a family\r\nholocaust; there was Dickie\'s mamma, unspoilable in her loveliness even\r\nby photography, and his papa grown very bald and archidiaconal; there\r\nwas Ethel\'s great achievement of influence, Dr. Spencer, beautiful in\r\nhis white hair; there were the vicar and the late and present\r\nhead-masters.  The pleasure excited by all these gifts far exceeded the\r\nanticipations of their donors, it seemed as if they had fallen on the\r\nvery moment when they would convey a sense of home, welcome, and\r\nrestoration.  He did not say much, but looked up with liquid lustrous\r\neyes, and earnest \'thank you\'s,\' and caressingly handled and examined\r\nthe treasures over and over again, as they lay round him on Dickie\'s\r\ncouch.  \'I suppose,\' said the child to him, \'it is like Job, when all\r\nhis friends came to see him, and every one gave him a piece of money.\'\r\n\r\n\'He could hardly have enjoyed it more,\' murmured Leonard, feeling the\r\nrestful capacity of happiness in the new possession of the child\'s\r\nardent love, and of the kind looks of all around, above all, of the one\r\npresence that still gave him his chief sense of sunshine.  The boyish\r\nand romantic touch of passion had, as Ethel had long seen, been burnt\r\nand seared away, and yet there was something left, something that, as\r\non this evening she felt, made his voice softer, his eye more\r\ndeferential, to her than to any one else.  Perhaps she had once been\r\nhis guiding star; and if in the wild tempests of the night he had\r\nlearnt instead to direct his course by the "Brightest and best of the\r\nsons of the morning," still the star would be prized and distinguished,\r\nas the first and most honoured among inferior constellations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n  Till now the dark was worn, and overhead\r\n  The lights of sunset and of sunrise mixed.--TENNYSON\r\n\r\n\r\nAt New York, Tom wrote a short letter to announce his safe arrival, and\r\nthen pushed on by railway into Indiana.  Winter had completely set in;\r\nand when he at length arrived at Winiamac, he found that a sleigh was a\r\nfar readier mode of conveyance to Massissauga than the wagons used in\r\nsummer.  His drive, through the white cathedral-like arcades of forest,\r\nhung with transparent icicles, and with the deep blue sky above,\r\nbecoming orange towards the west, was enjoyable; and even Massissauga\r\nitself, when its skeleton trees were like their neighbours, embellished\r\nby the pure snowy covering, looked less forlorn than when their death\r\ncontrasted with the exuberant life around.  He stopped at the hotel,\r\nleft his baggage there, and after undergoing a catechism on his\r\npersonal affairs, was directed to Mr. Muller\'s house, and made his way\r\nup its hard-trodden path of snow, towards the green door, at which he\r\nknocked two or three times before it was opened by a woman, whose hair\r\nand freckled skin were tinted nowhere but in Ireland.\r\n\r\nHe made a step forward out of the cutting blast into the narrow entry,\r\nand began to ask, \'Is Miss Ward here?  I mean, can I see Miss Warden?\'\r\nwhen, as if at the sound of his voice, there rang from within the door\r\nclose by a shriek--one of the hoarse hysterical cries he had heard upon\r\nthe day of the inquest.  Without a moment\'s hesitation, he pushed open\r\nthe door, and beheld a young lady in speechless terror hanging over the\r\nstiffened figure on the couch--the eyes wide open, the limbs straight\r\nand rigid.  He sprang forward, and lifted her into a more favourable\r\nposture, hastily asking for simple remedies likely to be at hand, and\r\nproducing a certain amount of revival for a few moments, though the\r\nstiffness was not passing--nor was there evidence of consciousness.\r\n\r\n\'Are you Leonard?\' said Cora Muller, under her breath, in this brief\r\ninterval, gazing into his face with frightened puzzled eyes.\r\n\r\n\'No; but I am come to tell her that he is free!\'  But the words were\r\ncut short by another terrible access, of that most distressing kind\r\nthat stimulates convulsion; and again the terrified women instinctively\r\nrendered obedience to the stranger in the measures he rapidly took, and\r\nhis words, \'hysteria--a form of hysteria,\' were forced from him by the\r\nnecessity of lessening Cora\'s intense alarm, so as to enable her to be\r\neffective.  \'We must send for Dr. Laidlaw,\' she began in the first\r\nbreathing moment, and again he looked up and said, \'I am a physician!\'\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Tom?\' she asked with the faintest shadow of a smile; he bent his\r\nhead, and that was their introduction, broken again by another\r\nfrightful attack; and when quiescence, if not consciousness, was\r\nregained, Tom knelt by the sofa, gazing with a sense of heart-rending\r\ndespair at the wasted features and thin hands, the waxen whiteness of\r\nthe cheek, and the tokens in which he clearly read long and consuming\r\nillness as well as the overthrow of the sudden shock.\r\n\r\n\'What is this?\' he asked, looking up to Cora\'s beautiful anxious face.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, she has been very sick, very sick,\' she answered; \'it was an\r\nattack of pleurisy; but she is getting better at last, though she will\r\nnot think so, and this news will make all well.  Does she hear? Say it\r\nagain!\'\r\n\r\nTom shook his head, afraid of the sound of the name as yet, and\r\nscarcely durst even utter the word \'Ella\' above his breath.\r\n\r\n\'She is gone out with Cousin Deborah to an apple bee,\' was the\r\nreassuring answer.  \'She wanted change, poor child!  Is she getting\r\nbetter?\'\r\n\r\nAveril was roused by a cough, the sound which tore Tom\'s heart by its\r\nimport, but he drew back out of her sight, and let Cora raise her, and\r\ngive her drink, in a soothing tender manner, that was evident\r\nrestoration.  \'Cora dear, is it you?\' she said, faintly; \'didn\'t I hear\r\nsome one else\'s voice?  Didn\'t they say--?\' and the shiver that crept\r\nover her was almost a return of the hysteric fit.\r\n\r\n\'We said he was free,\' said Cora, holding her in her arms.\r\n\r\n\'Free--yes, I know what that means--free among the dead,\' said Averil,\r\ncalmly, smoothing Cora\'s hair, and looking in her face. \'Don\'t be\r\nafraid to let me hear.  I shall be there with him and Minna soon.\r\nDidn\'t somebody come to tell me?  Please let him in, I\'ll be quiet now.\'\r\n\r\nAnd as she made gestures of arranging her hair and dress, Tom guardedly\r\npresented himself, saying in a voice that trembled with his endeavour\r\nto render it calm, \'Did you think I should have come if I had nothing\r\nbetter to tell you?\' and as she put out her hand in greeting, he took\r\nit in both his own, and met her eyes looking at him wide open, in the\r\nfirst dawning of the hope of an impossible gladness.  \'Yes,\' he said,\r\n\'the truth is come out--he is cleared--he is at home--at Stoneborongh!\'\r\n\r\nThe hot fingers closed convulsively on his own, then she raised\r\nherself, pressed her hands together, and gasped and struggled fearfully\r\nfor breath.  The joy and effort for self-command were more than the\r\nenfeebled frame could support, and there was a terrible and prolonged\r\nrenewal of those agonizing paroxysms, driving away every thought from\r\nthe other two except of the immediate needs.  At last, when the\r\nviolence of the attack had subsided, and left what was either fainting\r\nor stupor, they judged it best to carry her to her bed, and trust that,\r\nreviving without the associations of the other room, the agitation\r\nwould be less likely to return, and that she might sleep under the\r\ninfluence of an anodyne.  Poor Tom! it was not the reception he had\r\nfigured to himself, and after he had laid her down, and left her to\r\nCora and to Katty to be undressed, he returned to the parlour, and\r\nstood over the sinking wood-fire in dejection and dreariness of\r\nheart--wrung by the sufferings he had witnessed, with the bitter words\r\n(too late) echoing in his brain, and with the still more cruel\r\nthought--had it been his father or one of his brothers--any one to\r\nwhose kindness she could trust, the shock had not been so great, and\r\nthere would have been more sense of soothing and comfort! And then he\r\ntried to collect his impressions of her condition, and judge what would\r\nserve for her relief, but all his senses seemed to be scattered;\r\ndismay, compassion, and sympathy, had driven away all power of forming\r\na conclusion--he was no longer the doctor--he was only the anxious\r\nlistener for the faintest sound from the room above, but none reached\r\nhim save the creaking of the floor under Katty\'s heavy tread.\r\n\r\nThe gay tinkle of sleigh-bells was the next noise he heard, and\r\npresently the door was opened, and two muffled hooded figures looked\r\ninto the room, now only lighted by the red embers of the fire.\r\n\r\n\'Where\'s Cora? where\'s Ave?\' said the bright tone of the lesser.  \'It\r\nis all dark!\' and she was raising her voice to call, when Tom\r\ninstinctively uttered a \'Hush,\' and moved forward; \'hush, Ella, your\r\nsister has been ill.\'\r\n\r\nThe little muffled figure started at the first sound of his voice, but\r\nas he stepped nearer recoiled for a second, then with a low cry, almost\r\na sob of recognition, exclaimed, \'Mr. Tom!  Oh, Mr. Tom!  I knew you\r\nwould come!  Cousin Deborah, it\'s Mr. Tom!\' and she flew into his arms,\r\nand clung with an ecstasy of joy, unknowing the why or how, but with a\r\nsense that light had shone, and that her troubles were over.  She asked\r\nno questions, she only leant against him with, \'Mr. Tom!  Mr. Tom!\'\r\nunder her breath.\r\n\r\n\'But what is it, stranger?  Do tell!  Where are the girls?  What\'s this\r\nabout Avy\'s being sick?  Do you know the stranger, Ella?\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s Mr. Tom,\' she cried, holding his arm round her neck, looking up\r\nin a rapturous restfulness.\r\n\r\n\'I brought Miss Ward-en some good news that I fear has been too much\r\nfor her,\' said he; \'I am--only waiting to--hear how she is.\'\r\n\r\nBy way of answer, Deborah opened another door which threw more light on\r\nthe scene from the cooking stove in the kitchen, and at the same moment\r\nCora with a candle came down the stairs.\r\n\r\n\'O, Dr. May,\' she said, \'you have been too long left alone in the dark.\r\nI think she is asleep now.  You will stay.  We will have tea directly.\'\r\n\r\nTom faltered something about the hotel, and began to look at Cousin\r\nDeborah, and to consider the proprieties of life; but Cousin Deborah,\r\nCora, and Ella began declaring with one voice that he must remain for\r\nthe evening meal, and a bustle of cheerful preparation commenced, while\r\nElla still hung on his hand.\r\n\r\n\'But, Ella, you\'ve never asked my good news.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh dear!  I was too glad!  Are we going home then?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I trust so, I hope so, my dear; for Leonard\'s innocence has come\r\nto light, and he is free.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then Henry won\'t mind--and we may be called by our proper name\r\nagain--and Ave will be well,\' cried the child, as the ideas came more\r\nfully on her comprehension.  \'O, Cora!  O, Cousin Deborah, do you hear?\r\nDoes Ave know?  May I run up and tell Ave?\'\r\n\r\nThis of course was checked, but next Ella impetuously tore off her\r\nwraps for the convenience of spinning up and down wildly about the\r\nkitchen and parlour.  Leonard himself did not seem to have great part\r\nin her joy; Henry\'s policy had really nearly rooted out the thought of\r\nhim personally, and there was a veil of confusion over the painful\r\nperiod of his trial, which at the time she had only partially\r\ncomprehended.  But she did understand that his liberation would be the\r\nterm of exile; and though his name was to her connected with a\r\nmysterious shudder that made her shrink from uttering or hearing\r\ndetails, she had a security that Mr. Tom would set all right, and she\r\nloved him so heartily, that his presence was sunshine enough for her.\r\n\r\nA little discomfited at the trouble he was causing, Tom was obliged to\r\nwait while not only Cousin Deborah, but Cora busied herself in the\r\nkitchen, and Ella in her restless joy came backwards and forwards to\r\nreport their preparations, and at times to tarry a short space by his\r\nside, and tell of the recent troubles.  Ave had been very ill, she\r\nsaid, very ill indeed about a month ago, and Henry had come home to see\r\nher, but had been obliged to go away to the siege of Charleston when\r\nshe was better.  They had all been ill ever since they came there, but\r\nnow Mr. Tom was come, should not they all go home to dear Stoneborough,\r\naway from this miserable place?  If they could only take Cora with them!\r\n\r\nIt was still a childish tongue; but Ella had outgrown all her plump\r\nroundness, and was so tall and pale that Tom would hardly have known\r\nher.  Her welcome was relief and comfort, and she almost inspired her\r\nown belief that now all would be well.  His English ideas were rather\r\nset at rest by finding that Mrs. Deborah was to preside at the\r\ntea-table, and that he was not to be almost tete-a-tete with Miss\r\nMuller. Deborah having concluded her hospitable cares, catechized him\r\nto her full content, and satisfied herself on the mystery of the\r\nWardens\' life.\r\n\r\nAnd now what brought himself out?  She guessed he could not find an\r\nopening in the old country.  Tom smiled, explained his opening at home,\r\nand mentioned his charge of his late friend\'s book.\r\n\r\n\'So you are come out about the book, and just come a few hundred miles\r\nout of the way to bring this bit of news, that you could have\r\ntelegraphed,\' said the Yankee dame, looking at him with her keen eyes.\r\n\'Well, if you were coming, it was a pity you were not sooner. She has\r\npined away ever since she came here; and to such a worn-down condition\r\nas hers, poor child, I doubt joy\'s kinder more upsetting than trouble,\r\nwhen one is used to it.  There; I\'ll fix the things, and go up and sit\r\nwith Avy.  She\'ll be less likely to work herself into a flight again if\r\nshe sees me than one of you.\'\r\n\r\nSo Tom--less embarrassed now--found himself sitting by the fire, with\r\nElla roasting her favourite nuts for him, and Miss Muller opposite. He\r\nwas taken by surprise by her beautiful face, elegant figure, and\r\nlady-like manner, and far more by her evidently earnest affection for\r\nAveril.\r\n\r\nShe told him that ever since the fatal turn of little Minna\'s illness,\r\nAveril had been subject to distressing attacks of gasping and rigidity,\r\noften passing into faintness; and though at the moment of emotion she\r\noften showed composure and self-command, yet that nature always thus\r\nrevenged herself.  Suspense--letters from home or from Henry--even\r\nverses, or times connected with the past, would almost certainly bring\r\non the affection; and the heat of the summer had relaxed her frame, so\r\nas to render it even more unable to resist. There had been hope in the\r\nbracing of winter, but the first frosts had brought a chill, and a\r\nterrible attack of pleurisy, so dangerous that her brother had been\r\nsummoned; she had struggled through, however, and recovered to a\r\ncertain point, but there had stopped short, often suffering pain in the\r\nside, and never without panting breath and recurring cough.  This had\r\nbeen a slightly better day, and she had been lying on the sofa,\r\ncounting the days to Leonard\'s next letter, when the well-known voice\r\nfell on her ears, and the one strong effort to control herself had\r\nresulted in the frightful spasms, which had been worse than any Cora\r\nhad yet witnessed.\r\n\r\n\'But she will get well, and we shall go home,\' said Ella, looking up\r\nwistfully into Tom\'s mournful face.\r\n\r\n\'And I shall lose you,\' said Cora; \'but indeed I have long seen it was\r\nthe only thing.  If I had only known, she never should have come here.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, indeed, I feel that you would have led her to nothing that was not\r\nfor her good and comfort.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah! but I did not know,\' said Cora; \'I had not been here--and I only\r\nthought of my own pleasure in having her.  But if there is any way of\r\nfreeing her from this unfortunate speculation without a dead loss, I\r\nwill make father tell me.\'\r\n\r\nThis--from Cora\'s pretty mouth--though only honest and prudent, rather\r\njarred upon Tom in the midst of his present fears; and he began to\r\nprepare for his departure to the inn, after having sent up Ella to ask\r\nfor her sister, and hearing that she still slept soundly under the\r\ninfluence of the opiate.\r\n\r\nWhen Averil awoke it was already morning, and Cora was standing by her\r\nbed, with her eyes smiling with congratulation, like veronicas on a\r\nsunny day.\r\n\r\n\'Cora, is it true?\' she said, looking up.\r\n\r\nCora bent down and kissed her, and whispered, \'I wish you joy, my dear.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then it is,\' she said; \'it is not all a dream?\'\r\n\r\n\'No dream, dearest.\'\r\n\r\n\'Who said it?\' she asked.  \'O, Cora, that could not be true!\' and the\r\ncolour rose in her cheek.\r\n\r\n\'That! yes, Averil, if you mean that we had a visitor last evening. I\r\ntook him for Leonard, do you know!  Only I thought his eyes and hair\r\ndid not quite answer the description.\'\r\n\r\n\'He is a very gentleman-like person.  Did you not think so?\' said\r\nAveril.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! Ave, I\'ve heard a great deal.  Don\'t you think you had better tell\r\nme some more?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no!\' exclaimed Averil; \'you are not to think of folly,\' as\r\ncoughing cut her short.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll not think of any more than I can help, except what you tell me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Never think at all, Cora.  Oh! what has brought him here?  I don\'t\r\nknow how I can dare to see him again; and yet he is not gone, is he?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh no, he is only at the inn.  He is coming back again.\'\r\n\r\n\'I must be up.  Let me get up,\' said Averil, raising herself, but\r\npausing from weakness and breathlessness.\r\n\r\nAnd when they had forced some food upon her, she carried out her\r\nresolution, though twice absolutely fainting in the course of dressing;\r\nand at length crept softly, leaning on Cora\'s arm, into the parlour.\r\nThough Tom was waiting there, he neither spoke nor came forward till\r\nshe was safely placed upon the sofa, and then gathering breath, she\r\nsought him with her eager eyes, shining, large, lustrous, and wistful,\r\nas they looked out of the white thin face, where the once glowing\r\ncolour had dwindled to two burning carnation spots.  It was so piteous\r\na change that as he took her hand he was silent, from sheer inability\r\nto speak calmly.\r\n\r\n\'You have come to tell me,\' she said.  \'I am afraid I could not thank\r\nyou last night.\'  How different that soft pleading languid voice from\r\nthe old half defiant tone!\r\n\r\n\'I did not know you had been so unwell,\' he forced himself to say, \'or\r\nI would not have come so suddenly.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am grown so silly\' she said, trying to smile.  \'I hardly even\r\nunderstood last night;\' and the voice died away in the intense desire\r\nto hear.\r\n\r\n\'I--I was coming on business, and I thought you would not turn from the\r\ngood tidings, though I was the bearer,\' he said, in a broken, agitated,\r\napologetic way.\r\n\r\n\'Only let me hear it again,\' she said.  \'Did you say he was free?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, free as you are, or I.  At home.  My father was gone to fetch\r\nhim.\'\r\n\r\nShe put her hands over her face, and looked up with the sweetest smile\r\nhe had ever seen, and whispered, \'Now I can sing my Nunc dimittis.\'\r\n\r\nHe could not at once speak; and before he had done more than make one\r\ndeprecatory gesture, she asked, \'You have seen him?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not since this--not since September.\'\r\n\r\n\'I know.  You have been very good; and he is at home--ah! not home--but\r\nDr. May\'s.  Was he well?  Was he very glad?\'\r\n\r\n\'I have not seen him; I have not heard; you will hear soon.  I came at\r\nonce with the tidings.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you;\' and she clasped her hands together.  \'Have you seen Henry?\r\ndoes he know?\'\r\n\r\n\'Could I?  Had not you the first right?\'\r\n\r\n\'Leonard!  Oh, dear Leonard!\'  She lay back for a few moments, panting\r\nunder the gust of exceeding joy; while he was silent, and tried not to\r\nseem to observe her with his anxious eyes.  Then she recovered a little\r\nand said, \'The truth come out!  Did you say so? What was the truth?\'\r\n\r\n\'He paused a moment, afraid of the shock, and remembering that the\r\nsuspicion had been all unknown to her.  She recalled probabilities, and\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n\'Was it from a confession?  Is it known who--who was the real unhappy\r\nperson?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  Had you no suspicion?\'\r\n\r\n\'No--none,\' said Averil, shuddering, \'unless it was some robber.  Who\r\nwas it?\'\r\n\r\n\'You had never thought of the other nephew?\'\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t mean Samuel Axworthy!  Oh! no.  Why the last thing Leonard\r\nbade me, was always to pray for him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah!\' said Tom, with bent head, and colouring cheeks; \'but who are\r\nthose for whom such as Leonard would feel bound to pray?\'\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\'s silence, and then she said, \'His enemy!  Is that\r\nwhat you mean?  But then he would have known it was he.\'\r\n\r\n\'He was entirely convinced that so it must have been, but there was no\r\nproof, and an unsupported accusation would only have made his own case\r\nworse.\'\r\n\r\n\'And has he confessed? has he been touched and cleared Leonard at last?\'\r\n\r\n\'No; he had no space granted him.  It was the receipt in your brother\'s\r\nwriting that was found upon him.\'\r\n\r\n\'The receipt?  Yes, Leonard always said the receipt would clear him!\r\nBut oh, how dreadful!  He must have had it all the time.  How could he\r\nbe so cruel!  Oh!  I never felt before that such wickedness could be;\'\r\nand she lay, looking appalled and overpowered.\r\n\r\n\'Think of your brother knowing it all, and bidding--and giving you that\r\ninjunction--\' said Tom, feeling the necessity of overcoming evil with\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! if I had known it, I could not--I could not have been like\r\nLeonard!  And where--what has become of him?\' she asked, breathlessly.\r\n\'You speak as if he was dead.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  He was killed in a fray at a gaming-house!\'\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence, first of awe, then of thankfulness plainly\r\nbeaming in her upraised eyes and transparent countenance, which Tom\r\nwatched, filled with sensations, mournful but not wholly wretched.\r\nShattered as she was, sinking away from her new-found happiness, it was\r\na precious privilege to be holding to her the longed--for draught of\r\njoy.\r\n\r\n\'Tell me about it, please,\' she presently said.  \'Where--how did the\r\nreceipt come to light?  Were the police told to watch for it?  I want\r\nto know whom I have to thank.\'\r\n\r\nHis heart beat high, but there was a spirit within him that could not\r\nbrook any attempt to recall the promise he had pursued her with, the\r\npromise that he would not rest till he had proved her brother\'s\r\ninnocence.  He dreaded her even guessing any allusion to it, or\r\nfancying he had brought the proffered price in his hand; and when he\r\nbegan with, \'Can you bear to hear of the most shocking scene I ever\r\nwitnessed?\' he gave no hint of his true motive in residing at Paris, of\r\nthe clue that Bilson\'s draft had given him in thither pursuing\r\nAxworthy, nor of his severe struggle in relinquishing the quest.  He\r\nthrew over all the completest accidental air, and scarcely made it\r\nevident that it was he who had recognized the writing, and all that\r\nturned on it.  Averil listened to the narration, was silent for some\r\nspace, then having gone over it in her own mind, looked up and said--\r\n\r\n\'Then all this came of your being at that hospital;\' and a burning\r\nblush spread over the pale cheek, and made Tom shrink, start, and feel\r\nguilty of having touched the chord of obligation, connected with that\r\nobtrusive pledge of his.  Above all, however, to repress emotion was\r\nhis prime object; and he calmly answered, \'It was a good Providence\r\nthat brought any one there who knew the circumstances.\'\r\n\r\nShe was silent; and he was about to rise and relieve her from the sense\r\nof his presuming on her gratitude, when a cough, accompanied with a\r\npressure of her hand on her side, betrayed an access of suffering, that\r\ndrew him on to his other purpose of endeavouring to learn her\r\ncondition, and to do what he could for her relief.  His manner,\r\ncuriously like his father\'s, and all the home associations connected\r\nwith it, easily drew from her what he wanted to ascertain, and she\r\nperfectly understood its purport, and was calm and even bright.\r\n\r\n\'I was glad to be better when Henry went away,\' she said; \'he had so\r\nmuch to do, and we thought I was getting well then.  You must not\r\nfrighten him and hurry him here, if you please,\' she said, earnestly,\r\n\'for he must not be wasting his time here, and you think it will last a\r\nmonth or two, don\'t you?\'\r\n\r\n\'I want to persuade Henry to bring you all home, and enter into\r\npartnership with Mr. Wright,\' said Tom.  \'The voyage would--might--it\r\nwould be the best thing for you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Could I ever be well enough again?  Oh, don\'t tell me to think about\r\nit!  The one thing I asked for before I die has been given me, and now\r\nI know he is free, I will--will not set my mind on anything else.\'\r\n\r\nThere was a look so near heaven on her face, as she spoke, that Tom\r\ndurst not say any more of home, or earthly schemes; but, quiet, grave,\r\nand awe-stricken, left her to the repose she needed, and betook himself\r\nto the other room, where Ella, of course, flew on him, having been\r\nhardly detained by Cora from breaking in before.  His object was to go\r\nto see the medical man who had been attending Averil; and Cora assuring\r\nhim the horse had nothing to do in the frost, and telling him the times\r\nof the day when he would be most likely to find Dr. Laidlaw, he set\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nAveril meantime lay on her sofa calmly happy, and thankful, the worn\r\nand wearied spirit full of rest and gladness unspeakable, in the\r\nfulness of gratitude for the answered prayer that she might know her\r\nbrother free before her death.  If she had ever doubted of her own\r\nstate, she had read full confirmation in her physician\'s saddened eyes,\r\nand the absence of all hopeful auguries, except the single hint that\r\nshe might survive a voyage to England; and that she wished unsaid.\r\nLife, for the last five years, had been mournful work; there had been\r\none year of blind self-will, discord, and bitterness, then a crushing\r\nstroke, and the rest exhausted submission and hopeless bending to\r\nsorrow after sorrow, with self-reproach running through all.  Wearied\r\nout, she was glad to lay down the burthen, and accept the evening gleam\r\nas sunset radiance, without energy to believe it as the dawn of a\r\nbrighter day.  She shrank from being made even to wish to see Leonard.\r\nIf once she began to think it possible, it would be a hard sacrifice to\r\ngive it up; and on one point her resolution was fixed, that she would\r\nnot be made a cause for bringing him to share their wretchedness in\r\nAmerica.  Life and things of life were over with her, and she would\r\nonly be thankful for the softening blessings that came at its close,\r\nwithout stirring up vain longings for more. That kindness of Tom May,\r\nfor instance, how soothing it was after her long self-reproach for her\r\npetulant and cutting unjust reply to his generous affection--generous\r\nabove all at such a moment!\r\n\r\nAnd after all, it was he--it was he and no other who had cleared\r\nLeonard--he had fulfilled the pledge he had given when he did not know\r\nwhat he was talking of.  How she hated the blush that the sudden\r\nremembrance had called up on her face!  It was quite plain that he had\r\nbeen disgusted by her unkind, undignified, improper tone of rejection;\r\nand though out of humanity he had brought her the tidings, he would not\r\nlet her approach to thanking him, she was ashamed that he should have\r\ntraced an allusion, the most distant, to the scene he had, doubtless,\r\nloathed in remembrance.  He would, no doubt, go away to-day or\r\nto-morrow, and then these foolish thoughts would subside, and she\r\nshould be left alone with Cora and her thankfulness, to think again of\r\nthe great change before her!\r\n\r\nBut Tom was not gone.  Indeed Averil was much more ill before the next\r\nmorning, partly from hysteria, the reaction of the morning\'s\r\nexcitement, and partly from an aggravation of the more serious\r\npulmonary affection.  It was a temporary matter, and one that made his\r\nremaining the merest act of common humanity, since he had found Dr.\r\nLaidlaw a very third-rate specimen, and her brother was too far off to\r\nhave arrived in time to be of use.  The fresh science and skill of the\r\nyoung physician were indeed of the highest value, and under his care\r\nAveril rallied after a few days of prostration and suffering, during\r\nwhich she had watched and observed a good deal, and especially the good\r\nunderstanding between her doctor and Cora Muller. When Cousin Deborah\r\nwas sitting with her, they always seemed to be talking in the\r\ndrawing-room; nay, there were reports of his joining in the fabrication\r\nof some of the delicacies that were triumphantly brought to her room;\r\nand Ella was in a state of impatient pique at being slighted by \'Mr.\r\nTom,\' who, she complained, was always fighting with Cora about their\r\npolitics; and Cora herself used to bring what Dr. May had said, as the\r\nchoicest entertainment to her sick friend; while to herself he was\r\nmerely the physician, kind and gentle to the utmost degree; but keeping\r\nhis distance so scrupulously, that the pang awoke that he absolutely\r\ndisliked her, and only attended her from common compassion; and, it\r\nmight be, found consolation in being thus brought in contact with Cora.\r\nOh, if it were only possible to own her wrongs, and ask his pardon\r\nwithout a compromise of maidenliness!  Perhaps--perhaps she might, when\r\nshe was still nearer death, and when she was supposed to know how it\r\nwas between him and Cora.  Dear Cora, it would be a beautiful reward\r\nfor them both, and they would take care of Ella.  Cora would be happier\r\nthan ever yet among the Mays--and--Oh! why, why was there so much\r\nunkind selfish jealousy left, that instead of being glad, the notion\r\nleft her so very miserable?  Why did the prospect of such happiness for\r\nher self-devoted friend and nurse make her feel full of bitterness, and\r\nhardly able to bear it patiently, when she heard her speak the name of\r\nDr. May?\r\n\r\nAveril had again left her bed, and resumed her place on the sofa before\r\nletters arrived.  There was Leonard\'s from Cocksmoor Parsonage, the\r\nfirst real letter she had had from him since his term of servitude had\r\nbegun.  It was a grave and thankful letter, very short, doing little\r\nmore than mention every one\'s kindness, and express a hope of soon\r\nmeeting her and Ella, however and wherever Henry should think best.\r\nBrief as it was, it made her more thoroughly realize his liberty, and\r\nfeel that the yearning towards him in her heart was growing more and\r\nmore ardent, in spite of her strivings not to let it awaken.\r\n\r\nThe same post brought Henry\'s answer to Tom May\'s representation. It\r\nwas decisive.  He had broken off his whole connection with England, and\r\ndid not wish to return to a neighbourhood so full of painful\r\nrecollections.  He was making his way rapidly upwards in his present\r\nposition, and it would be folly to give up the advantages it offered;\r\nmoreover, he had no fears of the future well-doing of the Massissauga\r\nCompany.  As soon as the weather permitted it, he hoped to remove his\r\nsister to a healthier locality for change of air, but she could not be\r\nfit for a journey in the winter.  There were plenty of acknowledgments\r\nto the Mays for their kindness to Leonard, from whom Henry said he had\r\nheard, as well as from Dr. May, and others at Stoneborough.  He should\r\nadvise Leonard by all means to close with Mr. Bramshaw\'s offer, for he\r\nsaw no opening for him in the United States at present, although the\r\nultimate triumph over rebellion, &c. &c. &c.--in the most inflated\r\nstyle of Henry\'s truly adopted country. No one who had not known the\r\nwhole affair would ever enter into Leonard\'s entire innocence, the\r\nstigma of conviction would cleave to him, and create an impression\r\nagainst him and his family among strangers, and it was highly desirable\r\nthat he should remain among friends.  In fact, it was plain that Henry\r\nwas still ashamed of him, and wished to be free of a dangerous\r\nappendage.  Tom was so savagely angry at this letter that he could only\r\nwork off his wrath by a wild expedition in the snow, in the course of\r\nwhich he lost his way, wandered till the adventure began to grow\r\nperilous, came at last upon a squatter, with great difficulty induced\r\nhim to indicate the track sufficiently for his English density, and\r\narrived at Massissauga at nine o\'clock at night.  Averil was still on\r\nher sofa, quite calm and quiet, all but her two red spots; but\r\nafterwards, in her own room, she had one of her worst fits of spasms.\r\n\r\nHowever, she was up and dressed by the middle of the next day, and,\r\ncontrary to her wont since the first time, she sent Ella out of the\r\nroom when her doctor came to see her.\r\n\r\n\'I wanted to speak to you,\' she said, \'I have a great favour to ask of\r\nyou.  You will soon be going home.  Would you, could you take Ella with\r\nyou?  I know it is a great, a too great thing to ask.  But I would not\r\nhave her in any one\'s way.  I am going to write to Mrs. Wills, at the\r\nschool where I was, and Ella\'s means are quite enough to keep her\r\nthere, holidays and all, till Leonard can give her a home.  It will be\r\nmuch better for her, and a relief to Henry; and it will be giving back\r\none--one to Leonard!  It will be one thing more that I shall be happy\r\nabout.\'\r\n\r\nTom had let her go on with her short gentle sentences, because he knew\r\nnot how to answer; but at last she said, \'Forgive me, and do not think\r\nof it, if I have asked what I ought not, or would be troublesome.\'\r\n\r\nTroublesome! no, indeed!  I was only thinking--if it might not be\r\nbetter managed,\' he answered, rather by way of giving himself time to\r\ndebate whether the utterance of the one thought in his heart would lead\r\nto his being driven away.\r\n\r\n\'Pray do not propose Leonard\'s coming for her!  He must come to this\r\nfeverish place in spring.  And if he came, and I were not here, and\r\nHenry not wanting him!  Oh no, no; do not let me think of his coming!\'\r\n\r\n\'Averil,\' he said, kneeling on one knee so as to be nearer, and to be\r\nable to speak lower, \'you are so unearthly in your unselfishness, that\r\nI dare the less to put before you the one way in which I could take\r\nElla home to him.  It is if you would overlook the past, and give me a\r\nbrother\'s right in them both.\'\r\n\r\nShe turned in amazement to see if she had heard aright.  He had removed\r\nhis glasses, and the deep blue expressive eyes so seldom plainly\r\nvisible were wistfully, pleadingly, fixed on her, brimming over with\r\nthe dew of earnestness.  Her face of inquiry gave him courage to go on,\r\n\'If you would only let me, I think I could bring you home to see him;\r\nand if you would believe it and try, I believe I could make you\r\nhappier,\' and with an uncontrollable shake in his voice he ceased--and\r\nonly looked.\r\n\r\nShe sat upright, her hands clasped in her lap, her eyes shut, trying to\r\ncollect her thoughts; and the silence lasted for several seconds. At\r\nlast she said, opening her eyes, but gazing straight before her, not at\r\nhim, \'I do not think I ought.  Do you really know what you are saying?\r\nYou know I cannot get well.\'\r\n\r\n\'I know,\' he said.  \'All I ask is, to tend and watch over you while I\r\nmay, to bring you home to Leonard, and to be Ella\'s brother.\'\r\n\r\nHis voice was still and low, and he laid his hand on her folded ones\r\nwith reverent solemnity; but though it did not tremble, its touch was\r\ncold as marble, and conveyed to Averil an instant sense of the force of\r\nhis repressed emotion.  She started under it, and exclaimed with the\r\nfirst agitation she had shown, \'No, no; it would cost you too much.\r\nYou, young, beginning life--you must not take a sorrow upon you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is it not there already?\' he said, almost inaudibly.  \'Would it lessen\r\nit to be kept away from you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, do not go on, do not tempt me,\' she cried.  \'Think of your father.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nay, think what he is yourself.  Or rather look here,\' and he took out\r\na part of a letter from Ethel, and laid it before her.\r\n\r\n\'As to papa not guessing your object,\' she said, \'that was a vain\r\ndelusion if you ever entertained it, so you must not mind my having\r\nexplained.  He said if he had been you, it was just what he should have\r\ndone himself, and he is quite ready to throw his heart into it if you\r\nwill only trust to his kindness.  I do so want you really to try what\r\nthat is.\'\r\n\r\n\'And you came for this,\' faltered Averil, leaning back, almost overcome.\r\n\r\n\'I did not come meaning to hurry the subject on you.  I hoped to have\r\ninduced Henry to have brought you all home, and then, when I had done\r\nmy best to efface the recollection of that unpardonable behaviour, to\r\nhave tried whether you could look on me differently.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t like you to say that,\' said Averil, simply but earnestly; \'I\r\nhave felt over and over again how wrong I was--how ungrateful--to have\r\nutterly missed all the nobleness and generosity of your behaviour, and\r\nanswered in that unjust, ill-tempered way.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothing was ever more deserved,\' he answered; \'I have hated myself\r\never since, and I hope I am not as obnoxious now.\'\r\n\r\n\'It was I!\' she said; \'I have lived every bit of the winter over again,\r\nand seen that I was always ready to be offended, and somehow I could\r\nnot help caring so much for what you said, that lesser things from you\r\nhurt and cut as other people\'s did not.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you know what that proves?\' said Tom, with an arch subsmile\r\nlighting on his eyes and mouth; and as a glow awoke on her pale cheek,\r\nhe added, \'and won\'t you believe, too, that my propensity to\r\n"contemptuous irony" was all from my instinctive fear of what you could\r\ndo to me!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, don\'t repeat that!  I have been so bitterly ashamed of it!\'\r\n\r\n\'I am sure I have.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I have longed so to ask your pardon.  I thought I would leave a\r\nletter or message with Ella that you would understand.\'\r\n\r\n\'You can do better than that now.  You can forgive me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh!\' said Averil, her hands suddenly joined over her face, \'this is\r\none joy more!  I cannot think why it is all growing so bright just at\r\nlast--at last.  It is all come now!  How good it is!\'\r\n\r\nHe saw that she could bear no more.  He pressed no more for a decisive\r\nanswer; he did not return to the subject; but from that time he treated\r\nher as what belonged to him, as if it was his business to think, act,\r\nand judge for her, and to watch over her; and her acquiescence was\r\nabsolute.\r\n\r\nThere was not much speaking between them; there were chiefly skirmishes\r\nbetween him and Cora, to which she listened in smiling passive\r\namusement; and even when alone together they said little--actually\r\nnothing at all about the future.  He had written to Ethel on his first\r\narrival, and on the reply, as well as on Averil\'s state, all must\r\ndepend.  Meanwhile such a look of satisfied repose and peace shone upon\r\nAveril\'s face as was most sweet to look upon; and though extremely\r\nfeeble, and not essentially better, she was less suffering, and could\r\nin great languor, but in calm enjoyment, pass through day by day of the\r\nprecious present that had come to crown her long trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n  Oh, when its flower seems fain to die,\r\n  The full heart grudges smile or sigh\r\n  To aught beside, though fair and dear;\r\n  Like a bruised leaf, at touch of fear,\r\n  Its hidden fragrance love gives out.--Lyra Innocentum\r\n\r\n\r\n\'The letters at last!  One to Ethel, and three to Leonard!  Now for it,\r\nEthel!\'\r\n\r\nEthel opened--read--ran out of the room without a word, and sought her\r\nfather in his study, where she laid before him Tom\'s letter, written\r\nfrom Massissauga the day after his arrival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Dear Ethel,\r\n\r\n\'I have found my darling, but too late to arrest the disease--the work\r\nof her brother\'s perverseness and wrong-headedness.  I have no hope of\r\nsaving her; though it will probably be a matter of several months--that\r\nis, with care, and removal from this vile spot.\r\n\r\n\'I am writing to Henry, but I imagine that he is too much charmed with\r\nhis present prospects to give them up; and in her angelic\r\nself-sacrifice she insists on Leonard\'s not coming out.  Indeed, there\r\nwould be no use in his doing so unless she leaves this place; but\r\nshould no unforeseen complication supervene, it is my full persuasion\r\nthat she could be removed, safely make the voyage, and even be spared\r\nfor this summer among us.  Surely my father will not object!  It will\r\nbe but a short time; and she has suffered so much, so piteously needs\r\nlove and cherishing, that it is not in him to refuse.  He, who\r\nconsented to Margaret\'s engagement, cannot but feel for us.  I would\r\nwork for him all my life!  I would never cast a thought beyond home, if\r\nonly once hallowed by this dear presence for ever so short a time. Only\r\nlet the answers be so cordial as to remove all doubts or scruples; and\r\nwhen they are sent prepare for her.  I would bring her as quickly as\r\nher health permits.  No time must be lost in taking her from hence; and\r\nI wait only for the letters to obtain her consent to an immediate\r\nmarriage.  Furnish the house at once; I will repay you on my return.\r\nThere is L200 for the first floor, sitting, and bedrooms; for the rest\r\nthe old will do.  Only regard the making these perfect; colouring\r\npink--all as cheerful and pleasant as money can accomplish.  If Flora\r\nwill bear with me, get her to help you; or else Mary, if Cheviot\r\nforgives me.  Only don\'t spare cost.  I will make it up some way, if\r\nyou find more wanted.  I saw an invalid sofa, an improvement on\r\nMargaret\'s, which I will write to Gaspard to send from Paris.  If you\r\ncould only see the desolateness of the house where she has wasted away\r\nthese three years, you would long to make a bower of bliss for her.  I\r\ntrust to you.  I find I must trust everything to you.  I cannot write\r\nto my father; I have made nine beginnings, and must leave it to you.\r\nHe has comforted her, he knows her sorrows; he could not see her and\r\nbid me leave her.  Only there must be no hesitation.  That, or even\r\nremonstrance, would prevent her from consenting; and as to the\r\nobjections, I cannot know them better than I do.  Indeed, all this may\r\nbe in vain; she is so near Heaven, that I dare not talk to her of this;\r\nbut I have written to Leonard, dwelling chiefly on the chance of\r\nbringing her to him.  Her desire to keep him from attempting to come\r\nout will I trust be an inducement; but if you could only see her, you\r\nwould know how irreverent it seems to persecute one so nearly an angel\r\nwith such matters.  If I may only tend her to the last!  I trust to\r\nyou.  This is for my father.\r\n\r\n                                          \'Ever yours,\r\n                                              \'THOMAS MAY.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last sentence referred to a brief medical summary of her symptoms,\r\non a separate paper.\r\n\r\n\'Can this be Tom?\' was the Doctor\'s exclamation.  \'Poor boy! it is\r\ngoing very hard with him!\'\r\n\r\n\'This would soften it more than anything else could,\' said Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes!  You write.  Yes, and I\'ll write, and tell him he is free to\r\ntake his own way.  Poor child! she would have been a good girl if she\r\nhad known how.  Well, of all my eleven children that Tom should be the\r\none to go on in this way!\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor dear Tom!  What do you think of his statement of her case?  Is\r\nshe so very ill?\'\r\n\r\nDr. May screwed up his face.  \'A sad variety of mischief,\' he said; \'if\r\nall be as he thinks, I doubt his getting her home; but he is young, and\r\nhas his heart in it.  I have seen her mother in a state like this--only\r\nwithout the diseased lungs.  You can\'t remember it; but poor Ward never\r\nthought he could be grateful enough after she was pulled through.\r\nHowever, this is an aggravated case, and looks bad--very bad!  It is a\r\nmournful ending for that poor boy\'s patience--it will sink very deep,\r\nand he will be a sadder man all his days, but I would not hinder his\r\nlaying up a treasure that will brighten as he grows older.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, papa.  I shall tell him what you say.\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall write--to her I think.  I owe him something for not proving\r\nthat it is all as a study of pneumonia.  I say, Ethel, what is become\r\nof the "Diseases of Climate?"\' he added, with a twinkle in his eye.\r\n\r\n\'In the nine beginnings.\'\r\n\r\n\'And how about the Massissauga Company?\'\r\n\r\n\'You heartless old worldly-minded father!\' said Ethel.  \'When you take\r\nto prudence for Tom, what is the world coming to?\'\r\n\r\n\'Into order,\' said the Doctor, shaking himself into the coat she held\r\nfor him.  \'Tom surrendered to a pet patient of mine.  Now for poor\r\nLeonard!  Good-bye, young people!  I am off to Cocksmoor!\'\r\n\r\n\'Please take me, grandpapa,\' cried Dickie, hopping into the hall.\r\n\r\n\'You, you one-legged manikin!  I\'m going over all the world; and how\r\nare you to get home?\'\r\n\r\n\'On Leonard\'s back,\' said the undaunted Dickie.\r\n\r\n\'Not so, master: poor Leonard has news here that will take the taste of\r\nnonsense out of his mouth.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am his friend,\' said Dickie, with dignity.\r\n\r\n\'Then your friendship must not disturb him over his letters.  And can\r\nyou sit in the carriage and twirl your thumbs while I am at Fordham?\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall not twirl my thumbs.  I shall make out a problem on my ship\r\nchess-board.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s the boy who was sent from the Antipodes, that he might not be\r\nspoilt!\' quoth Aubrey, as the Doctor followed the child into the\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\n\'Granting reasonable wishes is not spoiling,\' said Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'May the system succeed as well with Dickie as with--\' and Aubrey in\r\none flourish indicated Gertrude and himself.\r\n\r\n\'Ay, we shall judge by the reception of Ethel\'s tidings!\' cried\r\nGertrude.  \'Now for it, Ethel.  Read us Tom\'s letter, confute the\r\nengineer, hoist with his own petard.\'\r\n\r\n\'Now, Ethel, confute the Daisy, the green field daisy--the simple\r\ninnocent daisy, deluded by "Diseases of Climate."\'\r\n\r\n\'Ethel looks as concerned as if it were fatal truth,\' added Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\'What is it?\' asked Aubrey.  \'If Henry Ward has gone down in a monitor\r\nat Charleston, I\'ll forgive him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not that,\' said Ethel; \'but we little thought how ill poor Ave is.\'\r\n\r\n\'Dangerously?\' said Aubrey, gravely.\r\n\r\n\'Not perhaps immediately so; but Tom means to marry at once, that he\r\nmay have a chance of bringing her home to see Leonard.\'\r\n\r\n\'Another shock for Leonard,\' said Aubrey, quite subdued, \'why can\'t he\r\nhave a little respite?\'\r\n\r\n\'May they at least meet once more!\' said Ethel; \'there will be some\r\ncomfort in looking to that!\'\r\n\r\n\'And what a fellow Tom is to have thought of it,\' added Aubrey. \'Nobody\r\nwill ever dare to say again that he is not the best of the kit of us!\r\nI must be off now to the meet: but if you are writing, Ethel, I wish\r\nyou would give her my love, or whatever he would like, and tell him he\r\nis a credit to the family.  I say, may I tell George Rivers?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes; it will soon be in the air; and Charles Cheviot will be down\r\non us!\'\r\n\r\nAway went Aubrey to mount the hunter that George Rivers placed at his\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nGertrude, who had been struck dumb, looked up to ask, \'Then it is\r\nreally so?\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed it is.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then,\' cried Gertrude, vehemently, \'you and he have been deceiving us\r\nall this time!\'\r\n\r\n\'No, Gertrude, there was nothing to tell.  I did not really know, and I\r\ncould not gossip about him.\'\r\n\r\n\'You might have hinted.\'\r\n\r\n\'I tried, but I was clumsy.\'\r\n\r\n\'I hate hints!\' exclaimed the impetuous young lady; \'one can\'t\r\nunderstand them, and gets the credit of neglecting them.  If people\r\nhave a secret attachment, they ought to let all their family know!\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps they do in Ireland.\'\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t feel one grain for me, Ethel,\' said Gertrude, with tears in\r\nher eyes.  \'Only think how Tom led me on to say horrid things about the\r\nWards; and now to recollect them, when she is so ill too--and he--\' She\r\nburst into sobs.\r\n\r\n\'My poor Daisy!  I dare say it was half my fault.\'\r\n\r\nGertrude gave an impatient leap.  \'There you go again! calling it your\r\nfault is worse than Charles\'s improving the circumstance.  It was my\r\nfault, and it shall be my fault, and nobody else\'s fault, except Tom\'s,\r\nand he will hate me, and never let me come near her to show that I am\r\nnot a nasty spiteful thing!\'\r\n\r\n\'I think that if you are quiet and kind, and not flighty, he will\r\nforget all that, and be glad to let you be a sister to her.\'\r\n\r\n\'A sister to Ave Ward!  Pretty preferment!\' muttered Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\'Poor Ave!  After the way she has borne her troubles, we shall feel it\r\nan honour to be sisters to her.\'\r\n\r\n\'And that chair!\' broke out Gertrude.  \'O, Ethel, you did out of malice\r\nprepense make me vow it should be for Mrs. Thomas May.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, Daisy, if you won\'t suspect me of improving the circumstance, I\r\nshould say that finishing it for her would be capital discipline.\'\r\n\r\n\'Horrid mockery, I should say,\' returned Gertrude, sadly; \'a gaudy\r\nrose-coloured chair, all over white fox-gloves, for a person in that\r\nstate--\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor Tom\'s great wish is to have her drawing-room made as charming as\r\npossible; and it would be a real welcome to her.\'\r\n\r\n\'Luckily,\' said Gertrude, breaking into laughter again, \'they don\'t\r\nknow when it began; how in a weak moment I admired the pattern, and\r\nBlanche inflicted it and all its appurtenances on me, hoping to convert\r\nme to a fancy-work-woman!  Dear me, pride has a fall!  I loved to\r\nanswer "Three stitches," when Mrs. Blanche asked after my progress.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, Daisy, if you did but respect any one!\'\r\n\r\n\'If they would not all be tiresome!  Seriously, I know I must finish\r\nthe thing, because of my word.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, and I believe keeping a light word that has turned out heavy, is\r\nthe best help in bridling the tongue.\'\r\n\r\n\'And, Ethel, I will really try to be seen and not heard while I am\r\nabout the work,\' said Gertrude, with an earnestness which proved that\r\nshe was more sorry than her manner conveyed.\r\n\r\nHer resolution stood the trying test of a visit from the elder married\r\nsisters; for, as Ethel said, the scent of the tidings attracted both\r\nFlora and the Cheviots; and the head-master endeavoured to institute a\r\nkind of family committee, to represent to the Doctor how undesirable\r\nthe match would be, entailing inconveniences that would not end with\r\nthe poor bride\'s life, and bringing at once upon Tom a crushing anxiety\r\nand sorrow.  Ethel\'s opinion was of course set aside by Mr. Cheviot,\r\nbut he did expect concurrence from Mrs. Rivers and from Richard, and\r\nFlora assented to all his objections, but she was not to be induced to\r\nsay she would remonstrate with her father or with Tom; and she\r\nintimated the uselessness thereof so plainly, that she almost hoped\r\nthat Charles Cheviot would be less eager to assail the Doctor with his\r\narguments.\r\n\r\n\'No hope of that,\' said Ethel, when he had taken leave.  \'He will\r\ndisburthen his conscience; but then papa is well able to take care of\r\nhimself!  Flora, I am so thankful you don\'t object.\'\r\n\r\n\'No indeed,\' said Flora.  \'We all know it is a pity; but it would be a\r\nfar greater pity to break it off now--and do Tom an infinity of harm.\r\nNow tell me all.\'\r\n\r\nAnd she threw herself into the subject in the homelike manner that had\r\ngrown on her, almost in proportion to Mary\'s guest-like ways and\r\nabsorption in her own affairs.\r\n\r\nSix weeks from that time, another hasty note announced that Dr. and\r\nMrs. Thomas May and Ella were at Liverpool; adding that Averil had been\r\nexceedingly ill throughout the voyage, though on being carried ashore,\r\nshe had so far revived, that Tom hoped to bring her home the next day;\r\nbut emotion was so dangerous, that he begged not to be met at the\r\nstation, and above all, that Leonard would not show himself till\r\nsummoned.\r\n\r\nDr. May being unavoidably absent, Ethel alone repaired to the\r\nnewly-furnished house for this strange sad bridal welcome.\r\n\r\nThe first person to appear when the carriage door was opened was a\r\nyoung girl, pale, tall, thin, only to be recognized by her black eyes.\r\nWith a rapid kiss and greeting, Ethel handed her on to the further\r\ndoor, where she might satisfy the eager embrace of the brother who\r\nthere awaited her; while Tom almost lifted out the veiled muffled\r\nfigure of his bride, and led her up-stairs to the sitting-room, where,\r\ndivesting her of hat, cloak, muff, and respirator, he laid her on the\r\nsofa, and looked anxiously for her reassuring smile before he even\r\nseemed to perceive his sister or left room for her greeting.\r\n\r\nThe squarely-made, high-complexioned, handsome Averil Ward was entirely\r\ngone.  In Averil May, Ethel saw delicately refined and sharpened\r\nfeatures, dark beautiful eyes, enlarged, softened, and beaming with\r\nperilous lustre, a transparently white blue-veined skin, with a lovely\r\nroseate tint, deepening or fading with every word, look, or movement,\r\nand a smile painfully sweet and touching, as first of the three, the\r\ninvalid found voice for thanks and inquiries for all.\r\n\r\n\'Quite well,\' said Ethel.  \'But papa has been most unluckily sent for\r\nto Whitford, and can\'t get home till the last train.\'\r\n\r\n\'It may be as well,\' said Tom: \'we must have perfect quiet till after\r\nthe night\'s rest.\'\r\n\r\n\'May I see one else to-night?\' she wistfully asked.\r\n\r\n\'Let us see how you are when you have had some coffee and are rested.\'\r\n\r\n\'Very well,\' she said, with a gentle submission, that was as new a\r\nsight as Tom\'s tenderness; \'but indeed I am not tired; and it is so\r\npretty and pleasant.  Is this really Dr. Spencer\'s old house?  Can\r\nthere be such a charming room in it?\'\r\n\r\n\'I did not think so,\' said Tom, looking in amazement at the effect\r\nproduced by the bright modern grate with its cheerful fire, the warm\r\ndelicate tints of the furniture, the appliances for comfort and\r\nornament already giving a home look.\r\n\r\n\'I know this is in the main your doing, Ethel; but who was the hand?\'\r\n\r\n\'All of us were hands,\' said Ethel; \'but Flora was the moving spring.\r\nShe went to London for a week about it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mrs. Rivers!  Oh, how good!\' said Averil, flushing with surprise; then\r\nraising herself, as her coffee was brought in a dainty little service,\r\nshe exclaimed, \'And oh, if it were possible, I should say that was my\r\ndear old piano!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Ethel, \'we thought you would like it; and Hector\r\nErnescliffe gave Mrs. Wright a new one for it.\'\r\n\r\nThis was almost too much.  Averil\'s lip trembled, but she looked up\r\ninto her husband\'s face, and made an answer, which would have been odd\r\nhad she not been speaking to his thought.\r\n\r\n\'Never mind! It is only happiness and the kindness.\'  And she drank the\r\ncoffee with an effort, and smiled at him again, as she asked, \'Where is\r\nElla?\'\r\n\r\n\'At our house,\' said Ethel; \'we mean her to be there for the present.\'\r\n\r\nKnowing with whom Ella must be, and fearing to show discontent with the\r\nmandate of patience, Averil again began to admire.  \'What a beautiful\r\nchair!  Look, Tom! is it not exquisite?  Whose work is it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Gertrude\'s.\'\r\n\r\n\'That is the most fabulous thing of all,\' said Tom, walking round it.\r\n\'Daisy!  Her present, not her work?\'\r\n\r\n\'Her work, every stitch.  It has been a race with time.\' The\r\ngratification of Averil\'s flush and smile was laid up by Ethel for\r\nGertrude\'s reward; but it was plain that Tom wanted complete rest for\r\nhis wife, and Ethel only waited to install her in the adjoining\r\nbed-room, which was as delightfully fitted up as the first apartment.\r\nAveril clung to her for the instant they were alone together, and\r\nwhispered, \'Oh, it is all so sweet!  Don\'t think I don\'t feel it! But\r\nyou see it is all I can do for him to be as quiet as I can!  Say so,\r\nplease!\'\r\n\r\nEthel felt the throb of the heart, and knew to whom she was to say so;\r\nbut Tom\'s restless approaching step made Averil detach herself, and\r\nsink into an arm-chair.  Ethel left her, feeling that the short clasp\r\nof their arms had sealed their sisterhood here and for ever.\r\n\r\n\'It is too sad, too beautiful to be talked about,\' she said to\r\nGertrude, who was anxiously on the watch for tidings.\r\n\r\nObedient as Averil was, she had not understood her husband\'s desire\r\nthat she should seek her pillow at once.  She was feeling brisk and\r\nfresh, and by no means ready for captivity, and she presently came\r\nforth again with her soft, feeble, noiseless step; but she had nearly\r\nretreated again, feeling herself mistaken and bewildered, for in the\r\ndrawing-room stood neither Tom nor his sisters, but a stranger--a dark,\r\ngrave, thoughtful man of a singularly resolute and settled cast of\r\ncountenance.  The rustle of her dress made him look up as she turned.\r\n\'Ave!\' he exclaimed; and as their eyes met, the light in those brown\r\ndepths restored the whole past.  She durst not trust herself to speak,\r\nas her head rested on his shoulder, his arms were round her; only as\r\nher husband came on the scene with a gesture of surprise, she said,\r\n\'Indeed, I did not mean it!  I did not know he was here.\'\r\n\r\n\'I might have known you could not be kept apart if I once let Leonard\r\nin,\' he said, as he arranged her on the sofa, and satisfied himself\r\nthat there were no tokens of the repressed agitation that left such\r\ndangerous effects.  \'Will you both be very good if I leave you to be\r\nhappy together?\' he presently added, after a few indifferent words had\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nAveril looked wistfully after him, as if he were wanted to complete\r\nfull felicity even in Leonard\'s presence.  How little would they once\r\nhave thought that her first words to her brother would be,  \'Oh, was\r\nthere ever any one like him?\'\r\n\r\n\'We owe it all to him,\' said Leonard.\r\n\r\n\'So kind,\' added Averil, \'not to be vexed, though he dreaded our\r\nmeeting so much; and you see I could not grieve him by making a fuss.\r\nBut this is nice!\' she added, with a sigh going far beyond the effect\r\nof the homely word.\r\n\r\n\'You are better.  Ella said so.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am feeling well to-night.  Come, let me look at you, and learn your\r\nface.\'\r\n\r\nHe knelt down beside her, and she stroked back the hair, which had\r\nfulfilled his wish that she should find it as long, though much darker\r\nthan of old.  Posture and action recalled that meeting, when her couch\r\nhad been his prison bed, and the cold white prison walls had frowned on\r\nthem; yet even in the rosy light of the cheerful room there was on them\r\nthe solemnity of an approaching doom.\r\n\r\n\'Where is the old face?\' Averil said.  \'You look as you did in the\r\nfever.  Your smile brings back something of yourself.  But, oh, those\r\nhollow eyes!\'\r\n\r\n\'Count Ugolino is Dr. May\'s name for me: but, indeed, Ave, I have tried\r\nto fatten for your inspection.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is not thinness,\' she said, \'but I had carried about with me the\r\nbright daring open face of my own boy.  I shall learn to like this\r\nbetter now.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nay, it is you and Ella that are changed.  O, Ave, you never let me\r\nknow what a place you were in.\'\r\n\r\n\'There were many things better than you fancy,\' she answered; \'and it\r\nis over--it is all gladness now.\'\r\n\r\n\'I see that in your face,\' he said, gazing his fill.  \'You do look ill\r\nindeed; but, Ave, I never saw you so content.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t help it,\' she said, smiling.  \'Every moment comes some fresh\r\nkindness from him.  The more trouble I give him the kinder he is.  Is\r\nit not as if the tempest was over, and we had been driven into the\r\nsmoothest little sunshiny bay?\'\r\n\r\n\'To rest and refit,\' he said, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\'For me, "the last long wave;" and a most gentle smooth one it is,\'\r\nsaid Averil; \'for you to refit for a fresh voyage.  Dear Leonard, I\r\nhave often guessed what you would do.\'\r\n\r\n\'What have you guessed?\'\r\n\r\n\'Only what we used to plan, in the old times after you had been at\r\nCoombe, Leonard.\'\r\n\r\n\'Dear sister!  And you would let me go!\'\r\n\r\n\'Our parting is near, any way,\' she said, her eye turning to the print\r\nfrom Ary Scheffer\'s St. Augustine and Monica.  \'Whoever gave us that,\r\ndivined how we ought to feel in these last days together.\'\r\n\r\n\'It was Richard May\'s gift,\' said Leonard.  \'Ave, there was nothing\r\nwanting but your liking this.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then so it is?\' she asked.\r\n\r\n\'Unless the past disqualifies me,\' he said.  \'I have spoken to no one\r\nyet, except little Dickie.  When I thought I ought to find some present\r\nemployment, and wanted to take a clerkship at Bramshaw\'s, Dr. May made\r\nme promise to wait till I had seen you before I fixed on anything; but\r\nmy mind is made up, and I shall speak now--with your blessing on it,\r\nAve.\'\r\n\r\n\'I knew it!\' she said.\r\n\r\nHe saw it was safer to quit this subject, and asked for Henry.\r\n\r\n\'He sent his love.  He met us at New York.  He is grown so soldierly,\r\nwith such a black beard, that he is more grown out of knowledge than\r\nany of us, but I scarcely saw him, for he was quite overset at my\r\nappearance, and Tom thought it did me harm.  I wish our new sister\r\nwould have come to see me.\r\n\r\n\'Sister!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, did you not know?  I thought Tom had written!  She is a Virginian\r\nlady, whose first husband was a doctor, who died of camp-fever early in\r\nthe war.  A Federal, of course.  And they are to be married as soon as\r\nCharleston has fallen.\'\r\n\r\nLeonard smiled.  And Averil expressed her certainty that it had fallen\r\nby that time.\r\n\r\n\'And he is quite Americanized?\' asked Leonard.  \'Does he return to our\r\nown name!  No?  Then I do not wonder he did not wish for me. Perhaps he\r\nmay yet bear to meet me, some day when we are grown old.\'\r\n\r\n\'At least we can pray to be altogether, where one is gone already\' said\r\nAveril.  \'That was the one comfort in parting with the dear Cora--my\r\nblessing through all the worst!  Leonard, she would not go to live in\r\nthe fine house her father has taken at New York, but she is gone to be\r\none of the nurses in the midst of all the hospital miseries.  And, oh,\r\nwhat comfort she will carry with her!\'\r\n\r\nHere Tom returned, but made no objection to her brother\'s stay,\r\nperceiving that his aspect and voice were like fulness to the hungry\r\nheart that had pined so long--but keeping all the others away; and they\r\nmeanwhile were much entertained by Ella, who was in joyous spirits; a\r\nlittle subdued, indeed, by the unknown brother, but in his absence very\r\ncommunicative.  Gertrude was greatly amused with her account of the\r\nmarriage, in the sitting-room at Massissauga, and of Tom\'s being so\r\nunprepared for the brevity of the American form, that he never knew\r\nwhere he was in the Service, and completed it with a puzzled \'Is that\r\nall?\'\r\n\r\nAveril had, according to Ella, been infinitely more calm and composed.\r\n\'She does nothing but watch his eyes,\' said Ella; \'and ever since we\r\nparted from Cora, I have had no one to speak to!  In the cabin he never\r\nstirred from sitting by her; and if she could speak at all, it was so\r\nlow that I could not hear.  School will be quite lively.\'\r\n\r\n\'Are you going to school?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes! where Ave was.  That is quite fixed; and I have had enough of\r\nplaying third person,\' said Ella, with her precocious Western manner.\r\n\'You know I have all my own property, so I shall be on no one\'s hands!\r\nOh, and Cora made her father buy all Ave\'s Massissauga shares--at a\r\ndead loss to us of course.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said Gertrude, \'I am sorry Tom is not an American share-holder.\r\nIt was such fun!\'\r\n\r\n\'He wanted to have made them all over to Henry; but Cora was\r\ndetermined; and her father is making heaps of money as a commissary, so\r\nI am sure he could afford it.  Some day, when the rebellion is subdued,\r\nI mean to go and see Cora and Henry and his wife,\' added Ella, whose\r\ntinge of Americanism formed an amusing contrast with Dickie\'s colonial\r\nease--especially when she began to detail the discomforts of\r\nMassissauga, and he made practical suggestions for the remedies of\r\neach--describing how mamma and he himself managed.\r\n\r\nThe younger ones had all gone to bed, Richard had returned home, and\r\nEthel was waiting to let her father in, when Leonard came back with the\r\nnew arrivals.\r\n\r\n\'I did not think you would be allowed to stay so late,\' said Ethel.\r\n\r\n\'We did not talk much.  I was playing chants most of the time; and\r\nafter she went to bed, I stayed with Tom.\'\r\n\r\n\'What do you think of her?\'\r\n\r\n\'I cannot think.  I can only feel a sort of awe.  End as it may, it\r\nwill have been a blessed thing to have had her among us like this.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, it ought to do us all good.  And I think she is full of\r\nenjoyment.\'\r\n\r\n\'Perfect enjoyment!\' repeated Leonard.  \'Thank God for that!\'\r\n\r\nAfter some pause, during which he turned over his pocket-book, as if\r\nseeking for something, he came to her, and said, \'Miss May, Averil has\r\nassented to a purpose that has long been growing up within me--and that\r\nI had rather consult you about than any one, because you first inspired\r\nit.\'\r\n\r\n\'I think I know the purpose you mean,\' said Ethel, her heart beating\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\n\'The first best purpose of my boyhood,\' he said.  \'If only it may be\r\ngiven back to me!  Will you be kind enough to look over this rough\r\ncopy?\'\r\n\r\nIt was the draught of a letter to the Missionary Bishop, Mr. Seaford\'s\r\ndiocesan, briefly setting forth Leonard\'s early history, his\r\nconviction, and his pardon, referring to Archdeacon May as a witness to\r\nthe truth of his narrative.\r\n\r\n\'After this statement,\' he proceeded, \'it appears to me little short of\r\neffrontery to offer myself for any share of the sacred labour in which\r\nyour Lordship is engaged; and though it had been the wish of the best\r\ndays of my youth, I should not have ventured on the thought but for the\r\nencouragement I received from Mr. Seaford, your Lordship\'s chaplain.  I\r\nhave a small income of my own, so that I should not be a burthen on the\r\nmission, and understanding that mechanical arts are found useful, I\r\nwill mention that I learnt shoemaking at Milbank, and carpentry at\r\nPortland, and I would gladly undertake any manual occupation needed in\r\na mission.  Latterly I was employed in the schoolmaster\'s department;\r\nand I have some knowledge of music.  My education is of course,\r\nimperfect, but I am endeavouring to improve myself.  My age is\r\ntwenty-one; I have good health, and I believe I can bring power of\r\nendurance and willingness to be employed in any manner that may be\r\nserviceable, whether as artisan or catechist.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think they will make a shoemaker of you,\' said Ethel, with her\r\nheart full.\r\n\r\n\'Will they have me at all?  There will always be a sort of\r\nticket-of-leave flavour about me,\' said Leonard, speaking simply,\r\nstraight-forwardly, but without dejection; \'and I might be doubtful\r\nmaterial for a mission.\'\r\n\r\n\'Your brother put that in your head.\'\r\n\r\n\'He implied that my case half known would be a discredit to him, and I\r\nam prepared for others thinking so.  If so, I can get a situation at\r\nPortland, and I know I can be useful there; but when such a hope as\r\nthis was opened to me again, I could not help making an attempt. Do you\r\nthink I may show that letter to Dr. May?\'\r\n\r\n\'O, Leonard, this is one of the best days of one\'s life!\'\r\n\r\n\'But what,\' he asked, as she looked over the letter, \'what shall I\r\nalter?\'\r\n\r\n\'I do not know, only you are so business-like; you do not seem to care\r\nenough.\'\r\n\r\n\'If I let myself out, it would look like unbecoming pressing of myself,\r\nconsidering what I am; but if you think I ought, I will say more.  I\r\nhave become so much used to writing letters under constraint, that I\r\nknow I am very dry.\'\r\n\r\n\'Let papa see it first,\' said Ethel.  \'After all, earnestness is best\r\nout of sight.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Wilmot and he shall decide whether I may send it,\' he said; \'and\r\nin the meantime I would go to St. Augustine\'s, if they will have me.\'\r\n\r\n\'I see you have thought it all over.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  I only waited to have spoken with my sister, and she--dear, dear\r\nAve--had separately thought of such a destination for me.  It was more\r\nthan acquiescence, more than I dared to hope!\'\r\n\r\n\'Her spirit will be with you, wherever she is!  And,\' with a sudden\r\nsmile, \'Leonard, was not this the secret between you and Dickie?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Leonard, smiling too; \'the dear little fellow is so fresh\r\nand loving, as well as so wise and discreet, that he draws out all that\r\nis in one\'s heart.  It has been a new life to me ever since he took to\r\nme!  Do you know, I believe he has been writing a letter of\r\nrecommendation of me on his own account to the Bishop; I told him he\r\nmust enclose it to his father if he presumed to send it, though he\r\nclaims the Bishop as his intimate friend.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah,\' said Ethel, \'papa is always telling him that they can\'t get on in\r\nNew Zealand for want of the small archdeacon, and that, I really think,\r\nabashes him more than anything else.\'\r\n\r\n\'He is not forward, he is only sensible,\' said Leonard, on whose heart\r\nDickie had far too fast a hold for even this slight disparagement not\r\nto be rebutted.  \'I had forgotten what a child could be till I was with\r\nhim; I felt like a stock or a stone among you all.\'\r\n\r\nEthel smiled.  \'I was nearly giving you "Marmion", in remembrance of\r\nold times, on the night of the Christmas-tree,\' she said; \'but I did\r\nnot then feel as if the "giving double" for all your care and trouble\r\nhad begun.\'\r\n\r\n\'The heart to feel it so was not come,\' said Leonard; \'now since I have\r\ngrasped this hope of making known to others the way to that Grace that\r\nheld me up,\'--he paused with excess of feeling--\'all has been joy, even\r\nin the recollection of the darkest days.  Mr. Wilmot\'s words come back\r\nnow, that it may all have been training for my Master\'s work.  Even the\r\nmanual labour may have been my preparation!\' His eyes brightened, and\r\nhe was indeed more like the eager, hopeful youth she remembered than\r\nshe had ever hoped to see him; but this brightness was the flash of\r\nsteel, tried, strengthened, and refined in the fire--a brightness that\r\nmight well be trusted.\r\n\r\n\'One knew it must be so,\' was all she could say.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes,\' he said, eagerly.  \'You sent me words of greeting that held\r\nup my faith; and, above all, when we read those books at Coombe, you\r\nput the key of comfort in my hand, and I never quite lost it. Miss\r\nMay,\' he added, as Dr. May\'s latch-key was heard in the front door, \'if\r\never I come to any good, I owe it to you!\'\r\n\r\nAnd that was the result of the boy\'s romance.  The first tidings of the\r\ntravellers next morning were brought near the end of breakfast by Tom,\r\nwho came in looking thin, worn, and anxious, saying that Averil had\r\ncalled herself too happy to sleep till morning, when a short doze had\r\nonly rendered her feeble, exhausted, and depressed.\r\n\r\n\'I shall go and see her,\' said Dr. May; \'I like my patients best in\r\nthat mood.\'\r\n\r\nNor would the Doctor let his restless, anxious son do more than make\r\nthe introduction, but despatched him to the Hospital; whence returning\r\nto find himself still excluded, he could endure nothing but pacing up\r\nand down the lawn in sight of his father\'s head in the window, and\r\nseeking as usual Ethel\'s sympathy.\r\n\r\nThere was some truth in what Charles Cheviot had said.  Wedlock did\r\nenhance the grief and loss, and Tom found the privilege of these months\r\nof tendance more heart-wringing than he had anticipated, though of\r\ncourse more precious and inestimable.  Moreover, Averil\'s depression\r\nhad been a phase of her illness which had not before revealed itself in\r\nsuch a degree.\r\n\r\n\'Generally,\' he said, \'she has talked as if what she looks to were all\r\nsuch pure hope and joy, that though it broke one\'s heart to hear it,\r\none saw it made her happy, and could stand it.  Fancy, Ethel, not an\r\nhour after we were married, I found her trying the ring on this finger,\r\nand saying I should be able to wear it like my father!  It seemed as if\r\nshe would regret nothing but my sorrow, and that my keeping it out of\r\nsight was all that was needful to her happiness. But to-day she has\r\nbeen blaming herself for--for grieving to leave all so soon, just as\r\nher happiness might have been beginning!  Think, Ethel!  Reproaching\r\nherself for unthankfulness even to tears!  It might have been more for\r\nher peace to have remained with her where she had no revival of these\r\nassociations, if they are only pain to her.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh no, no, Tom.  It only proves the pleasure they do give her.  You\r\nknow, better than I do, that there must be ups and downs, failures of\r\nspirits from fatigue when the will is peaceful and resigned.\'\r\n\r\n\'I know it.  I know it with my understanding, Ethel, but as to\r\nreasoning about her as if she was anybody else, the thing is mere\r\nmockery.  What can my father be about?\' he added, for the twentieth\r\ntime.  \'Talking to her in the morning always knocks her up.  If he had\r\nonly let me warn him; but he hurried me off in his inconsiderate way.\'\r\n\r\nAt last, however, the head disappeared, and Tom rushed indoors.\r\n\r\n\'So, Tom, you have made shorter work of twenty-five patients than I of\r\none.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll go again,\' said poor Tom, in the desperation of resolute\r\nmeekness, \'only let me see how she is.\'\r\n\r\n\'Let Ethel go up now.  She is very cheery except for a little headache.\'\r\n\r\nWhile Ethel obeyed, Dr. May began a minute interrogation of his son, so\r\nlengthened that Tom could hardly restrain sharp impatient replies to\r\nsuch apparent trifling with his agony to learn how long his father\r\nthought he could keep his treasure, and how much suffering might be\r\nspared to her.\r\n\r\nAt last Dr. May said, \'I may be wrong.  Your science is fresher than\r\nmine; but to me there seem indications that the organic disease is in\r\nthe way of being arrested.  Good health of course she cannot have; but\r\nif she weathers another winter, I think you may look for as many years\r\nof happiness with her as in an ordinary case.\'\r\n\r\nIt was the first accent of hope since the hysteric scream that had been\r\nhis greeting, and all his reserve and dread of emotion: could not\r\nprevent his covering his face with his hands, and sobbing aloud.\r\n\'Father, father,\' he said, \'you cannot tell what this is to me!\'\r\n\r\n\'I can in part, my boy,\' said the Doctor, sadly.\r\n\r\n\'And,\' he started up and walked about the room, \'you shall have the\r\nwhole treatment.  I will only follow your measures.  No one at New York\r\nsaw the slightest hope of checking it.\'\r\n\r\n\'They had your account, and you hardly allowed enough for the\r\nhysterical affection.  I do not say it is certainty--far less, health.\'\r\n\r\n\'Any way, any way, if I may only have her to lie and look at me, it is\r\nhappiness unlooked for!  You don\'t think I could have treated her\r\notherwise?\'\r\n\r\n\'No.  Under His blessing you saved her yourself.  You would have\r\nperceived the change if she had been an indifferent person.\'\r\n\r\nTom made another turn to the door, and came back still half wild, and\r\nlaid his face on his arms upon the table.  \'You tell her,\' he said, \'I\r\nshall never be able--\'\r\n\r\nKnocking at Averil\'s door, Dr. May was answered by a call of \'Tom.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not this time, my dear.  He is coming, but we have been talking you\r\nover.  Ave, you have a very young doctor, and rather too much\r\ninterested.\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed!\' she said, indignantly; \'he has made me much better.\'\r\n\r\n\'Exactly so, my dear; so much better that he agrees with me that he\r\nexpressed a strong opinion prematurely.\'\r\n\r\n\'They thought the same at New York,\' she said, still resolved on his\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\n\'My dear, unless you are bent on growing worse in order to justify his\r\nfirst opinion, I think you will prove that which he now holds. And,\r\nAve, it was, under Providence, skill that we may be proud of by which\r\nhe has subdued the really fatal disorder.  You may have much to\r\nundergo, and must submit to a sofa life and much nursing, but I think\r\nyou will not leave him so soon.\'\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause; at last she said, \'O, Dr. May, I beg your\r\npardon.  If I had known, I would never--\'\r\n\r\n\'Never what, my dear?\'\r\n\r\n\'Never have consented!  It is such a grievous thing for a professional\r\nman to have a sick wife.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is exactly what he wanted, my dear, if you will not fly at me for\r\nsaying so.  Nothing else could teach him that patients are not cases\r\nbut persons; and here he comes to tell you what he thinks of the\r\ntrouble of a sick wife.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said Dr. May, as he and Ethel walked away together, \'poor young\r\nthings, they have a chequered time before them.  Pretty well for the\r\ndoctor who hated sick people, Wards, and Stoneborough; but, after all,\r\nI have liked none of our weddings better.  I like people to rub one\r\nanother brighter.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I am proud when the least unselfish nature has from first to last\r\ndone the most unselfish things.  No one of us has ever given up so much\r\nas Tom, and I am sure he will be happy in it.\'\r\n\r\nMore can hardly be said without straying into the realms of prediction;\r\nyet such of our readers as are bent on carrying on their knowledge of\r\nthe Daisies beyond the last sentence, may be told that, to the best of\r\nour belief, Leonard\'s shoemaking is not his foremost office in the\r\nmission, where he finds that fulness of hopeful gladness which\r\nexperience shows is literally often vouchsafed to those who have given\r\nup home, land, and friends, for the Gospel\'s sake.  His letters are the\r\ndelight of more than one at Stoneborough; and his sister, upon her\r\nsofa, is that home member of a mission without whom nothing can be\r\ndone--the copier of letters, the depot of gifts, the purveyor of\r\ncommissions, the maker of clothes, the collector of books, the keeper\r\nof accounts--so that the house still merits the name of the S. P. G.\r\noffice, as it used to be called in the Spenserian era.  But Mrs. Thomas\r\nMay is a good deal more than this.  Her sofa is almost a renewal of the\r\nfamily centre that once Margaret\'s was; the region where all tidings\r\nare brought fresh for discussion, all joys and sorrows poured out, the\r\nexternal influence that above all has tended to soften Gertrude into\r\nthe bright grace of womanhood.  Mary Cheviot and Blanche Ernescliffe\r\ncannot be cured of a pitying \'poor Tom\'--as they speak of \'the\r\nProfessor\'--in which title the awkward sound of Dr. Tom has been merged\r\nsince an appointment subsequent to the appearance of the "Diseases of\r\nClimate".  But every one else holds that not his honours as a\r\nscientific physician, his discoveries, and ably-written  papers--not\r\neven his father\'s full and loving confidence and gratitude, give\r\nProfessor May as much happiness as that bright-eyed delicate wife, with\r\nwhom all his thoughts seem to begin and end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Trial, by Charlotte M.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
