BELLAMY\r\n\r\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nBY HEYWOOD BROUN\r\n\r\n\r\nA good many of my radical friends express a certain kindly\r\ncondescension when they speak of Edward Bellamy\'s "Looking Backward."\r\n\r\n"Of course you know," they say, "that it really isn\'t first-rate\r\neconomics."\r\n\r\nAnd yet in further conversation I have known a very large number of\r\nthese same somewhat scornful Socialists to admit, "You know, the first\r\nthing that got me started to thinking about Socialism was Bellamy\'s\r\n\'Looking Backward.\'"\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning it has been a highly provocative book. It is now.\r\nMany of the questions both of mood and technique are even more\r\npertinent in the year 1931 than they were in 1887. A critic of the\r\n_Boston Transcript_ said, when the novel first appeared, that the new\r\nState imagined by Bellamy was all very well, but that the author lost\r\nmuch of his effectiveness by putting his Utopia a scant fifty years\r\nahead, and that he might much better have made it seventy-five\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the fifty years assigned for changing the world\r\nutterly are almost gone by now. Not everything which was predicted in\r\n"Looking Backward" has come to pass. But the laugh is not against\r\nBellamy, but against his critic. Some of the things which must have\r\nseemed most improbable of all to the _Transcript_ man of 1887 are now\r\nactually in being.\r\n\r\nIn one respect Edward Bellamy set down a picture of modern American\r\nlife which is almost a hundred per cent realized. It startled me to\r\nread the passage in which Edith shows the musical schedule to Julian\r\nWest, and tells him to choose which selection he wishes to have\r\nbrought through the air into the music room. It is true that Bellamy\r\nimagined this broadcasting to be done over telephone wires, as is\r\nindeed the case to-day in some phases of national hook-ups. But\r\nconsider this quotation:\r\n\r\n"He [Dr. Leete] showed how, by turning a screw, the volume of the\r\nmusic could be made to fill the room, or die away to an echo so faint\r\nand far that one could scarcely be sure whether he heard or imagined\r\nit."\r\n\r\nThat might almost have been lifted bodily from an article in some\r\nnewspaper radio column.\r\n\r\nBut Bellamy did see with clear vision things and factors much more\r\nimportant than the possibility of hearing a sermon without going to\r\nchurch. Much which is now established in Soviet Russia bears at least\r\na likeness to the industrial army visioned in this prophetic book.\r\nHowever, Communism can scarcely claim Bellamy as its own, for he\r\nemphasizes repeatedly the non-violent features of the revolution which\r\nhe imagined. Indeed, at one point he argues that the left-wingers of\r\nhis own day impeded change by the very excesses of their technical\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\nThere is in his book no acceptance of a transitional stage of class\r\ndictatorship. He sees the change coming through a general recognition\r\nof the failings of the capitalist system. Indeed, he sees a point in\r\neconomic development where capitalism may not even be good enough for\r\nthe capitalist.\r\n\r\nTo the strict Marxian Socialist this is profound and ridiculous\r\nheresy. To me it does not seem fantastic. And things have happened in\r\nthe world already which were not dreamt of in Karl Marx\'s philosophy.\r\n\r\nThe point I wish to stress is the prevalent notion that all radical\r\nmovements in America stem from the writings of foreign authors. Now,\r\nBellamy, of course, was familiar with the pioneer work of Marx. And\r\nthat part of it which he liked he took over. Nevertheless, he\r\ndeveloped a contribution which was entirely his own. It is irrelevant\r\nto say that, after all, the two men differed largely in their view of\r\nthe technique by which the new world was to be accomplished. A\r\ndifference in technique, as Trotzky knows to his sorrow, may be as\r\nprofound as a difference in principle.\r\n\r\nBellamy was essentially a New-Englander. His background was that of\r\nBoston and its remote suburbs. And when he preaches the necessity of\r\nthe cooperative commonwealth, he does it with a Yankee twang. In fact,\r\nhe is as essentially native American as Norman Thomas, the present\r\nleader of the Socialist Party in this country.\r\n\r\nI cannot confess any vast interest in the love story which serves as a\r\nthread for Bellamy\'s vision of a reconstructed society. But it can be\r\nsaid that it is so palpably a thread of sugar crystal that it need not\r\nget in the way of any reader.\r\n\r\nI am among those who first became interested in Socialism through\r\nreading "Looking Backward" when I was a freshman in college. It came\r\nin the first half-year of a course which was designed to prove that\r\nall radical panaceas were fundamentally unsound in their conception.\r\nThe professor played fair. He gave us the arguments for the radical\r\ncause in the fall and winter, and proceeded to demolish them in spring\r\nand early summer.\r\n\r\nBut what one learns in the winter sticks more than words uttered in\r\nthe warmth of drowsy May and June. Possibly I took more cuts toward\r\nthe end of the lecture course. All I can remember is the arguments in\r\nfavor of the radical plans. Their fallacies I have forgotten.\r\n\r\nI differ from Bellamy\'s condescending converts because I feel that he\r\nis close to an entirely practical and possible scheme of life. Since\r\nmuch of the fantastic quality of his vision has been rubbed down into\r\nreality within half a century, I think there is at least a fair chance\r\nthat another fifty years will confirm Edward Bellamy\'s position as one\r\nof the most authentic prophets of our age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR OF "LOOKING BACKWARD"\r\n\r\n\r\n                              "We ask\r\n    To put forth just our strength, our human strength,\r\n    All starting fairly, all equipped alike."\r\n\r\n    "But when full roused, each giant limb awake,\r\n    Each sinew strung, the great heart pulsing fast,\r\n    He shall start up and stand on his own earth,\r\n    Then shall his long, triumphant march begin,\r\n    Thence shall his being date."\r\n\r\n                                   BROWNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great poet\'s lines express Edward Bellamy\'s aim in writing his\r\nfamous book. That aim would realize in our country\'s daily being the\r\nGreat Declaration that gave us national existence; would, in equality\r\nof opportunity, give man his own earth to stand on, and thereby--the\r\nrace for the first time enabled to enter unhampered upon the use of\r\nits God-given possibilities--achieve a progress unexampled and\r\nmarvelous.\r\n\r\nIt is now twelve years since the writing of \'Looking Backward\' changed\r\none of the most brilliant of the younger American authors into an\r\nimpassioned social reformer whose work was destined to have momentous\r\neffect upon the movement of his age. His quality had hitherto been\r\nmanifest in romances like \'Doctor Heidenhof\'s Process\' and \'Miss\r\nLudington\'s Sister,\' and in many short stories exquisite in their\r\nimaginative texture and largely distinguished by a strikingly original\r\ndevelopment of psychical themes. Tales like \'The Blindman\'s World\' and\r\n\'To Whom This May Come\' will long linger in the memory of magazine\r\nreaders of the past twenty years.\r\n\r\n\'Doctor Heidenhof\' was at once recognized as a psychological study of\r\nuncommon power. "Its writer," said an English review, "is the lineal\r\nintellectual descendant of Hawthorne." Nor was there in America any\r\nlack of appreciation of that originality and that distinction of style\r\nwhich mark Edward Bellamy\'s early work. In all this there was a strong\r\ndominant note prophetic of the author\'s future activity. That note was\r\na steadfast faith in the intrinsic goodness of human nature, a sense\r\nof the meaning of love in its true and universal sense. \'Looking\r\nBackward,\' though ostensibly a romance, is universally recognized as a\r\ngreat economic treatise in a framework of fiction. Without this guise\r\nit could not have obtained the foothold that it did; there is just\r\nenough of the skillful novelist\'s touch in its composition to give\r\nplausibility to the book and exert a powerful influence upon the\r\npopular imagination. The ingenious device by which a man of the\r\nnineteenth century is transferred to the end of the twentieth, and the\r\nvivid dramatic quality of the dream at the end of the book, are\r\ninstances of the art of the trained novelist which make the work\r\nunique of its kind. Neither could the book have been a success had not\r\nthe world been ripe for its reception. The materials were ready and\r\nwaiting; the spark struck fire in the midst of them. Little more than\r\na decade has followed its publication, and the world is filled with\r\nthe agitation that it helped kindle. It has given direction to\r\neconomic thought and shape to political action.\r\n\r\nEdward Bellamy was born in 1850,--almost exactly in the middle of the\r\ncentury whose closing years he was destined so notably to affect. His\r\nhome has always been in his native village of Chicopee Falls,\r\nMassachusetts, now a portion of the city of Chicopee, one of the group\r\nof municipalities of which Springfield is the nucleus. He lived on\r\nChurch Street in a house long the home of his father, a beloved\r\nBaptist clergyman of the town. His clerical ancestry is perhaps\r\nresponsible for his essentially religious nature. His maternal\r\ngrandfather was the Rev. Benjamin Putnam, one of the early pastors of\r\nSpringfield, and among his paternal ancestors was Dr. Joseph Bellamy\r\nof Bethlehem, Connecticut, a distinguished theologian of revolutionary\r\ndays, a friend of Jonathan Edwards, and the preceptor of Aaron Burr.\r\nHe, however, outgrew with his boyhood all trammels of sect. But this\r\ninherited trait marked his social views with a strongly\r\nanti-materialistic and spiritual cast; an ethical purpose dominated\r\nhis ideas, and he held that a merely material prosperity would not be\r\nworth the working for as a social ideal. An equality in material\r\nwell-being, however, he regarded as the soil essential for the true\r\nspiritual development of the race.\r\n\r\nYoung Bellamy entered Union College at Schenectady, but was not\r\ngraduated. After a year in Germany he studied law and entered the bar,\r\nbut never practiced. A literary career appealed to him more strongly,\r\nand journalism seemed the more available gateway thereto. His first\r\nnewspaper experience was on the staff of the New York \'Evening Post,\'\r\nand from that journal he went to the Springfield \'Union.\' Besides his\r\nEuropean trip, a journey to Hawaii by way of Panama and a return\r\nacross the continent gave a considerable geographical range to his\r\nknowledge of the world at large.\r\n\r\nIt is notable that his first public utterance, made before a local\r\nlyceum when a youth in his teens, was devoted to sentiments of social\r\nreform that foreshadowed his future work. When \'Looking Backward\' was\r\nthe sensation of the year, a newspaper charge brought against Mr.\r\nBellamy was that he was "posing for notoriety." To those who know the\r\nretiring, modest, and almost diffident personality of the author,\r\nnothing could have been more absurd. All opportunities to make money\r\nupon the magnificent advertising given by a phenomenal literary\r\nsuccess were disregarded. There were offers of lecture engagements\r\nthat would have brought quick fortune, requests from magazine editors\r\nfor articles and stories on any terms that he might name, proffered\r\ninducements from publishers to write a new book and to take advantage\r\nof the occasion to make a volume of his short stories with the\r\nassurance of a magnificent sale,--to all this he was strikingly\r\nindifferent. Two or three public addresses, a few articles in the\r\nreviews, and for a while the editorship of \'The New Nation,\' a weekly\r\nperiodical which he established in Boston,--this was the sum of his\r\npublic activity until he should have made himself ready for a second\r\nsustained effort. To all sordid incentives he was as indifferent as if\r\nhe had been a child of his new order, a century later. The hosts of\r\npersonal friends whom his work made for him knew him as a winsome\r\npersonality; and really to know him was to love him. His nature was\r\nkeenly sympathetic; his conversation ready and charming, quickly\r\nresponsive to suggestion, illuminated by gentle humor and occasionally\r\na flash of playful satire. He disliked controversy, with its waste of\r\nenergy in profitless discussion, and jestingly averred that if there\r\nwere any reformers living in his neighborhood he should move away.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal features of \'Looking Backward,\' that distinguish it from\r\nthe generality of Utopian literature, lie in its definite scheme of\r\nindustrial organization on a national basis, and the equal share\r\nallotted to all persons in the products of industry, or the public\r\nincome, on the same ground that men share equally in the free gifts of\r\nnature, like air to breathe and water to drink; it being absolutely\r\nimpossible to determine any equitable ratio between individual\r\nindustrial effort and individual share in industrial product on a\r\ngraded basis. The book, however, was little more than an outline of\r\nthe system, and, after an interval devoted to continuous thought and\r\nstudy, many points called for elaboration. Mr. Bellamy gave his last\r\nyears and his ripest efforts to an exposition of the economical and\r\nethical basis of the new order which he held that the natural course\r\nof social evolution would establish.\r\n\r\n\'Equality\' is the title of his last book. It is a more elaborate work\r\nthan \'Looking Backward,\' and in fact is a comprehensive economic\r\ntreatise upon the subject that gives it its name. It is a sequel to\r\nits famous predecessor, and its keynote is given in the remark that\r\nthe immortal preamble of the American Declaration of Independence\r\n(characterized as the true constitution of the United States),\r\nlogically contained the entire statement of universal economic\r\nequality guaranteed by the nation collectively to its members\r\nindividually. "The corner-stone of our state is economic equality, and\r\nis not that the obvious, necessary, and only adequate pledge of these\r\nthree rights,--life, liberty, and happiness? What is life without its\r\nmaterial basis, and what is an equal right to life but a right to an\r\nequal material basis for it? What is liberty? How can men be free who\r\nmust ask the right to labor and to live from their fellow-men and seek\r\ntheir bread from the hands of others? How else can any government\r\nguarantee liberty to men save by providing them a means of labor and\r\nof life coupled with independence; and how could that be done unless\r\nthe government conducted the economic system upon which employment and\r\nmaintenance depend? Finally, what is implied in the equal right of all\r\nto the pursuit of happiness? What form of happiness, so far as it\r\ndepends at all upon material facts, is not bound up with economic\r\nconditions; and how shall an equal opportunity for the pursuit of\r\nhappiness be guaranteed to all save by a guarantee of economic\r\nequality?"\r\n\r\nThe book is so full of ideas, so replete with suggestive aspects, so\r\nrich in quotable parts, as to form an arsenal of argument for apostles\r\nof the new democracy. As with \'Looking Backward,\' the humane and\r\nthoughtful reader will lay down \'Equality\' and regard the world about\r\nhim with a feeling akin to that with which the child of the tenement\r\nreturns from his "country week" to the foul smells, the discordant\r\nnoises, the incessant strife of the wonted environment.\r\n\r\nBut the writing of \'Equality\' was a task too great for the physical\r\nstrength and vitality of its author. His health, never robust, gave\r\nway completely, and the book was finished by an indomitable and\r\ninflexible dominion of the powerful mind over the failing body which\r\nwas nothing short of heroic. Consumption, that common New England\r\ninheritance, developed suddenly, and in September of 1897 Mr. Bellamy\r\nwent with his family to Denver, willing to seek the cure which he\r\nscarcely hoped to find.\r\n\r\nThe welcome accorded to him in the West, where his work had met with\r\nwidespread and profound attention, was one of his latest and greatest\r\npleasures. Letters came from mining camps, from farms and villages,\r\nthe writers all longing to do something for him to show their love.\r\n\r\nThe singular modesty already spoken of as characterizing Mr. Bellamy,\r\nand an entire unwillingness to accept any personal and public\r\nrecognition, had perhaps kept him from a realization of the fact that\r\nhis fame was international. But the author of a book which in ten\r\nyears had sold nearly a million of copies in England and America, and\r\nwhich had been translated into German, French, Russian, Italian,\r\nArabic, Bulgarian, and several other languages and dialects, found\r\nhimself not among strangers, although two thousand miles from the home\r\nof his lifetime.\r\n\r\nHe greatly appreciated and gratefully acknowledged his welcome to\r\nColorado, which he left in April, 1898, when he realized that his life\r\nwas rapidly drawing to a close.\r\n\r\nHe died on Sunday morning, May 22, after a month in the old home which\r\nhe had eagerly desired to see again, leaving a widow and two young\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nAt the simple service held there, with his kindred and the friends of\r\na lifetime about him, the following passages from \'Looking Backward\'\r\nand \'Equality\' were read as a fitting expression, in his own words, of\r\nthat hope for the bettering and uplifting of Humanity, which was the\r\nreal passion of his noble life.\r\n\r\n"Said not the serpent in the old story, \'If you eat of the fruit of\r\nthe tree of knowledge you shall be as gods?\' The promise was true in\r\nwords, but apparently there was some mistake about the tree. Perhaps\r\nit was the tree of selfish knowledge, or else the fruit was not ripe.\r\nThe story is obscure. Christ later said the same thing when he told\r\nmen that they might be the sons of God. But he made no mistake as to\r\nthe tree he showed them, and the fruit was ripe. It was the fruit of\r\nlove, for universal love is at once the seed and fruit, cause and\r\neffect, of the highest and completest knowledge. Through boundless\r\nlove man becomes a god, for thereby is he made conscious of his\r\noneness with God, and all things are put under his feet. \'If we love\r\none another, God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us.\' \'He\r\nthat loveth his brother dwelleth in the light.\' \'If any man say, I\r\nlove God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar.\' \'He that loveth not\r\nhis brother abideth in death.\' \'God is love, and he that dwelleth in\r\nlove dwelleth in God.\' \'Every one that loveth knoweth God.\' \'He that\r\nloveth not knoweth not God.\'\r\n\r\n"Here is the very distillation of Christ\'s teaching as to the\r\nconditions of entering on the divine life. In this we find the\r\nsufficient explanation why the revelation which came to Christ so long\r\nago and to other illumined souls could not possibly be received by\r\nmankind in general so long as an inhuman social order made a wall\r\nbetween man and God, and why, the moment that wall was cast down, the\r\nrevelation flooded the earth like a sunburst.\r\n\r\n"\'If we love one another, God dwelleth in us,\' and mark how the words\r\nwere made good in the way by which at last the race found God! It was\r\nnot, remember, by directly, purposely, or consciously seeking God. The\r\ngreat enthusiasm of humanity which overthrew the older and brought in\r\nthe fraternal society was not primarily or consciously a Godward\r\naspiration at all. It was essentially a humane movement. It was a\r\nmelting and flowing forth of men\'s hearts toward one another; a rush\r\nof contrite, repentant tenderness; an impassioned impulse of mutual\r\nlove and self-devotion to the common weal. But \'if we love one\r\nanother, God dwelleth in us,\' and so man found it. It appears that\r\nthere came a moment, the most transcendent moment in the history of\r\nthe race of man, when with the fraternal glow of this world of\r\nnew-found embracing brothers there seems to have mingled the ineffable\r\nthrill of a divine participation, as if the hand of God were clasped\r\nover the joined hands of men. And so it has continued to this day and\r\nshall for evermore.\r\n\r\n"Your seers and poets in exalted moments had seen that death was but a\r\nstep in life, but this seemed to most of you to have been a hard\r\nsaying. Nowadays, as life advances toward its close, instead of being\r\nshadowed by gloom, it is marked by an access of impassioned expectancy\r\nwhich would cause the young to envy the old, but for the knowledge\r\nthat in a little while the same door will be opened to them. In your\r\nday the undertone of life seems to have been one of unutterable\r\nsadness, which, like the moaning of the sea to those who live near the\r\nocean, made itself audible whenever for a moment the noise and bustle\r\nof petty engrossments ceased. Now this undertone is so exultant that\r\nwe are still to hear it.\r\n\r\n"Do you ask what we look for when unnumbered generations shall have\r\npassed away? I answer, the way stretches far before us, but the end is\r\nlost in light. For twofold is the return of man to God, \'who is our\r\nhome,\' the return of the individual by the way of death, and the\r\nreturn of the race by the fulfillment of its evolution, when the\r\ndivine secret hidden in the germ shall be perfectly unfolded. With a\r\ntear for the dark past, turn we then to the dazzling future, and,\r\nveiling our eyes, press forward. The long and weary winter of the race\r\nis ended. Its summer has begun. Humanity has burst the chrysalis. The\r\nheavens are before it."\r\n\r\nThere are those who have made strenuous objections to the ideals of\r\nEdward Bellamy on the ground that they are based on nothing better\r\nthan purely material well-being. In the presence of the foregoing\r\nutterance can they maintain that attitude?\r\n\r\n                                   SYLVESTER BAXTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR\'S PREFACE\r\n\r\nHistorical Section Shawmut College, Boston,\r\nDecember 26, 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nLiving as we do in the closing year of the twentieth century, enjoying\r\nthe blessings of a social order at once so simple and logical that it\r\nseems but the triumph of common sense, it is no doubt difficult for\r\nthose whose studies have not been largely historical to realize that\r\nthe present organization of society is, in its completeness, less than\r\na century old. No historical fact is, however, better established than\r\nthat till nearly the end of the nineteenth century it was the general\r\nbelief that the ancient industrial system, with all its shocking\r\nsocial consequences, was destined to last, with possibly a little\r\npatching, to the end of time. How strange and wellnigh incredible does\r\nit seem that so prodigious a moral and material transformation as has\r\ntaken place since then could have been accomplished in so brief an\r\ninterval? The readiness with which men accustom themselves, as\r\nmatters of course, to improvements in their condition, which, when\r\nanticipated, seemed to leave nothing more to be desired, could not be\r\nmore strikingly illustrated. What reflection could be better\r\ncalculated to moderate the enthusiasm of reformers who count for their\r\nreward on the lively gratitude of future ages!\r\n\r\nThe object of this volume is to assist persons who, while desiring to\r\ngain a more definite idea of the social contrasts between the\r\nnineteenth and twentieth centuries, are daunted by the formal aspect\r\nof the histories which treat the subject. Warned by a teacher\'s\r\nexperience that learning is accounted a weariness to the flesh, the\r\nauthor has sought to alleviate the instructive quality of the book by\r\ncasting it in the form of a romantic narrative, which he would be glad\r\nto fancy not wholly devoid of interest on its own account.\r\n\r\nThe reader, to whom modern social institutions and their underlying\r\nprinciples are matters of course, may at times find Dr. Leete\'s\r\nexplanations of them rather trite,--but it must be remembered that to\r\nDr. Leete\'s guest they were not matters of course, and that this book\r\nis written for the express purpose of inducing the reader to forget\r\nfor the nonce that they are so to him. One word more. The almost\r\nuniversal theme of the writers and orators who have celebrated this\r\nbi-millennial epoch has been the future rather than the past, not the\r\nadvance that has been made, but the progress that shall be made, ever\r\nonward and upward, till the race shall achieve its ineffable destiny.\r\nThis is well, wholly well, but it seems to me that nowhere can we find\r\nmore solid ground for daring anticipations of human development during\r\nthe next one thousand years, than by "Looking Backward" upon the\r\nprogress of the last one hundred.\r\n\r\nThat this volume may be so fortunate as to find readers whose interest\r\nin the subject shall incline them to overlook the deficiencies of the\r\ntreatment is the hope in which the author steps aside and leaves Mr.\r\nJulian West to speak for himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOOKING BACKWARD.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nI first saw the light in the city of Boston in the year 1857. "What!"\r\nyou say, "eighteen fifty-seven? That is an odd slip. He means nineteen\r\nfifty-seven, of course." I beg pardon, but there is no mistake. It was\r\nabout four in the afternoon of December the 26th, one day after\r\nChristmas, in the year 1857, not 1957, that I first breathed the east\r\nwind of Boston, which, I assure the reader, was at that remote period\r\nmarked by the same penetrating quality characterizing it in the\r\npresent year of grace, 2000.\r\n\r\nThese statements seem so absurd on their face, especially when I add\r\nthat I am a young man apparently of about thirty years of age, that no\r\nperson can be blamed for refusing to read another word of what\r\npromises to be a mere imposition upon his credulity. Nevertheless I\r\nearnestly assure the reader that no imposition is intended, and will\r\nundertake, if he shall follow me a few pages, to entirely convince him\r\nof this. If I may, then, provisionally assume, with the pledge of\r\njustifying the assumption, that I know better than the reader when I\r\nwas born, I will go on with my narrative. As every schoolboy knows, in\r\nthe latter part of the nineteenth century the civilization of to-day,\r\nor anything like it, did not exist, although the elements which were\r\nto develop it were already in ferment. Nothing had, however, occurred\r\nto modify the immemorial division of society into the four classes, or\r\nnations, as they may be more fitly called, since the differences\r\nbetween them were far greater than those between any nations nowadays,\r\nof the rich and the poor, the educated and the ignorant. I myself was\r\nrich and also educated, and possessed, therefore, all the elements of\r\nhappiness enjoyed by the most fortunate in that age. Living in luxury,\r\nand occupied only with the pursuit of the pleasures and refinements of\r\nlife, I derived the means of my support from the labor of others,\r\nrendering no sort of service in return. My parents and grandparents\r\nhad lived in the same way, and I expected that my descendants, if I\r\nhad any, would enjoy a like easy existence.\r\n\r\nBut how could I live without service to the world? you ask. Why should\r\nthe world have supported in utter idleness one who was able to render\r\nservice? The answer is that my great-grandfather had accumulated a sum\r\nof money on which his descendants had ever since lived. The sum, you\r\nwill naturally infer, must have been very large not to have been\r\nexhausted in supporting three generations in idleness. This, however,\r\nwas not the fact. The sum had been originally by no means large. It\r\nwas, in fact, much larger now that three generations had been\r\nsupported upon it in idleness, than it was at first. This mystery of\r\nuse without consumption, of warmth without combustion, seems like\r\nmagic, but was merely an ingenious application of the art now happily\r\nlost but carried to great perfection by your ancestors, of shifting\r\nthe burden of one\'s support on the shoulders of others. The man who\r\nhad accomplished this, and it was the end all sought, was said to live\r\non the income of his investments. To explain at this point how the\r\nancient methods of industry made this possible would delay us too\r\nmuch. I shall only stop now to say that interest on investments was a\r\nspecies of tax in perpetuity upon the product of those engaged in\r\nindustry which a person possessing or inheriting money was able to\r\nlevy. It must not be supposed that an arrangement which seems so\r\nunnatural and preposterous according to modern notions was never\r\ncriticised by your ancestors. It had been the effort of law-givers and\r\nprophets from the earliest ages to abolish interest, or at least to\r\nlimit it to the smallest possible rate. All these efforts had,\r\nhowever, failed, as they necessarily must so long as the ancient\r\nsocial organizations prevailed. At the time of which I write, the\r\nlatter part of the nineteenth century, governments had generally given\r\nup trying to regulate the subject at all.\r\n\r\nBy way of attempting to give the reader some general impression of the\r\nway people lived together in those days, and especially of the\r\nrelations of the rich and poor to one another, perhaps I cannot do\r\nbetter than to compare society as it then was to a prodigious coach\r\nwhich the masses of humanity were harnessed to and dragged toilsomely\r\nalong a very hilly and sandy road. The driver was hunger, and\r\npermitted no lagging, though the pace was necessarily very slow.\r\nDespite the difficulty of drawing the coach at all along so hard a\r\nroad, the top was covered with passengers who never got down, even at\r\nthe steepest ascents. These seats on top were very breezy and\r\ncomfortable. Well up out of the dust, their occupants could enjoy the\r\nscenery at their leisure, or critically discuss the merits of the\r\nstraining team. Naturally such places were in great demand and the\r\ncompetition for them was keen, every one seeking as the first end in\r\nlife to secure a seat on the coach for himself and to leave it to his\r\nchild after him. By the rule of the coach a man could leave his seat\r\nto whom he wished, but on the other hand there were many accidents by\r\nwhich it might at any time be wholly lost. For all that they were so\r\neasy, the seats were very insecure, and at every sudden jolt of the\r\ncoach persons were slipping out of them and falling to the ground,\r\nwhere they were instantly compelled to take hold of the rope and help\r\nto drag the coach on which they had before ridden so pleasantly. It\r\nwas naturally regarded as a terrible misfortune to lose one\'s seat,\r\nand the apprehension that this might happen to them or their friends\r\nwas a constant cloud upon the happiness of those who rode.\r\n\r\nBut did they think only of themselves? you ask. Was not their very\r\nluxury rendered intolerable to them by comparison with the lot of\r\ntheir brothers and sisters in the harness, and the knowledge that\r\ntheir own weight added to their toil? Had they no compassion for\r\nfellow beings from whom fortune only distinguished them? Oh, yes;\r\ncommiseration was frequently expressed by those who rode for those who\r\nhad to pull the coach, especially when the vehicle came to a bad place\r\nin the road, as it was constantly doing, or to a particularly steep\r\nhill. At such times, the desperate straining of the team, their\r\nagonized leaping and plunging under the pitiless lashing of hunger,\r\nthe many who fainted at the rope and were trampled in the mire, made a\r\nvery distressing spectacle, which often called forth highly creditable\r\ndisplays of feeling on the top of the coach. At such times the\r\npassengers would call down encouragingly to the toilers of the rope,\r\nexhorting them to patience, and holding out hopes of possible\r\ncompensation in another world for the hardness of their lot, while\r\nothers contributed to buy salves and liniments for the crippled and\r\ninjured. It was agreed that it was a great pity that the coach should\r\nbe so hard to pull, and there was a sense of general relief when the\r\nspecially bad piece of road was gotten over. This relief was not,\r\nindeed, wholly on account of the team, for there was always some\r\ndanger at these bad places of a general overturn in which all would\r\nlose their seats.\r\n\r\nIt must in truth be admitted that the main effect of the spectacle of\r\nthe misery of the toilers at the rope was to enhance the passengers\'\r\nsense of the value of their seats upon the coach, and to cause them to\r\nhold on to them more desperately than before. If the passengers could\r\nonly have felt assured that neither they nor their friends would ever\r\nfall from the top, it is probable that, beyond contributing to the\r\nfunds for liniments and bandages, they would have troubled themselves\r\nextremely little about those who dragged the coach.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that this will appear to the men and women of the\r\ntwentieth century an incredible inhumanity, but there are two facts,\r\nboth very curious, which partly explain it. In the first place, it was\r\nfirmly and sincerely believed that there was no other way in which\r\nSociety could get along, except the many pulled at the rope and the\r\nfew rode, and not only this, but that no very radical improvement even\r\nwas possible, either in the harness, the coach, the roadway, or the\r\ndistribution of the toil. It had always been as it was, and it always\r\nwould be so. It was a pity, but it could not be helped, and philosophy\r\nforbade wasting compassion on what was beyond remedy.\r\n\r\nThe other fact is yet more curious, consisting in a singular\r\nhallucination which those on the top of the coach generally shared,\r\nthat they were not exactly like their brothers and sisters who pulled\r\nat the rope, but of finer clay, in some way belonging to a higher\r\norder of beings who might justly expect to be drawn. This seems\r\nunaccountable, but, as I once rode on this very coach and shared that\r\nvery hallucination, I ought to be believed. The strangest thing about\r\nthe hallucination was that those who had but just climbed up from the\r\nground, before they had outgrown the marks of the rope upon their\r\nhands, began to fall under its influence. As for those whose parents\r\nand grandparents before them had been so fortunate as to keep their\r\nseats on the top, the conviction they cherished of the essential\r\ndifference between their sort of humanity and the common article was\r\nabsolute. The effect of such a delusion in moderating fellow feeling\r\nfor the sufferings of the mass of men into a distant and philosophical\r\ncompassion is obvious. To it I refer as the only extenuation I can\r\noffer for the indifference which, at the period I write of, marked my\r\nown attitude toward the misery of my brothers.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 I came to my thirtieth year. Although still unmarried, I was\r\nengaged to wed Edith Bartlett. She, like myself, rode on the top of\r\nthe coach. That is to say, not to encumber ourselves further with an\r\nillustration which has, I hope, served its purpose of giving the\r\nreader some general impression of how we lived then, her family was\r\nwealthy. In that age, when money alone commanded all that was\r\nagreeable and refined in life, it was enough for a woman to be rich to\r\nhave suitors; but Edith Bartlett was beautiful and graceful also.\r\n\r\nMy lady readers, I am aware, will protest at this. "Handsome she might\r\nhave been," I hear them saying, "but graceful never, in the costumes\r\nwhich were the fashion at that period, when the head covering was a\r\ndizzy structure a foot tall, and the almost incredible extension of\r\nthe skirt behind by means of artificial contrivances more thoroughly\r\ndehumanized the form than any former device of dressmakers. Fancy any\r\none graceful in such a costume!" The point is certainly well taken,\r\nand I can only reply that while the ladies of the twentieth century\r\nare lovely demonstrations of the effect of appropriate drapery in\r\naccenting feminine graces, my recollection of their great-grandmothers\r\nenables me to maintain that no deformity of costume can wholly\r\ndisguise them.\r\n\r\nOur marriage only waited on the completion of the house which I was\r\nbuilding for our occupancy in one of the most desirable parts of the\r\ncity, that is to say, a part chiefly inhabited by the rich. For it\r\nmust be understood that the comparative desirability of different\r\nparts of Boston for residence depended then, not on natural features,\r\nbut on the character of the neighboring population. Each class or\r\nnation lived by itself, in quarters of its own. A rich man living\r\namong the poor, an educated man among the uneducated, was like one\r\nliving in isolation among a jealous and alien race. When the house had\r\nbeen begun, its completion by the winter of 1886 had been expected.\r\nThe spring of the following year found it, however, yet incomplete,\r\nand my marriage still a thing of the future. The cause of a delay\r\ncalculated to be particularly exasperating to an ardent lover was a\r\nseries of strikes, that is to say, concerted refusals to work on the\r\npart of the brick-layers, masons, carpenters, painters, plumbers, and\r\nother trades concerned in house building. What the specific causes of\r\nthese strikes were I do not remember. Strikes had become so common at\r\nthat period that people had ceased to inquire into their particular\r\ngrounds. In one department of industry or another, they had been\r\nnearly incessant ever since the great business crisis of 1873. In fact\r\nit had come to be the exceptional thing to see any class of laborers\r\npursue their avocation steadily for more than a few months at a time.\r\n\r\nThe reader who observes the dates alluded to will of course recognize\r\nin these disturbances of industry the first and incoherent phase of\r\nthe great movement which ended in the establishment of the modern\r\nindustrial system with all its social consequences. This is all so\r\nplain in the retrospect that a child can understand it, but not being\r\nprophets, we of that day had no clear idea what was happening to us.\r\nWhat we did see was that industrially the country was in a very queer\r\nway. The relation between the workingman and the employer, between\r\nlabor and capital, appeared in some unaccountable manner to have\r\nbecome dislocated. The working classes had quite suddenly and very\r\ngenerally become infected with a profound discontent with their\r\ncondition, and an idea that it could be greatly bettered if they only\r\nknew how to go about it. On every side, with one accord, they\r\npreferred demands for higher pay, shorter hours, better dwellings,\r\nbetter educational advantages, and a share in the refinements and\r\nluxuries of life, demands which it was impossible to see the way to\r\ngranting unless the world were to become a great deal richer than it\r\nthen was. Though they knew something of what they wanted, they knew\r\nnothing of how to accomplish it, and the eager enthusiasm with which\r\nthey thronged about any one who seemed likely to give them any light\r\non the subject lent sudden reputation to many would-be leaders, some\r\nof whom had little enough light to give. However chimerical the\r\naspirations of the laboring classes might be deemed, the devotion\r\nwith which they supported one another in the strikes, which were their\r\nchief weapon, and the sacrifices which they underwent to carry them\r\nout left no doubt of their dead earnestness.\r\n\r\nAs to the final outcome of the labor troubles, which was the phrase by\r\nwhich the movement I have described was most commonly referred to, the\r\nopinions of the people of my class differed according to individual\r\ntemperament. The sanguine argued very forcibly that it was in the very\r\nnature of things impossible that the new hopes of the workingmen could\r\nbe satisfied, simply because the world had not the wherewithal to\r\nsatisfy them. It was only because the masses worked very hard and\r\nlived on short commons that the race did not starve outright, and no\r\nconsiderable improvement in their condition was possible while the\r\nworld, as a whole, remained so poor. It was not the capitalists whom\r\nthe laboring men were contending with, these maintained, but the\r\niron-bound environment of humanity, and it was merely a question of\r\nthe thickness of their skulls when they would discover the fact and\r\nmake up their minds to endure what they could not cure.\r\n\r\nThe less sanguine admitted all this. Of course the workingmen\'s\r\naspirations were impossible of fulfillment for natural reasons, but\r\nthere were grounds to fear that they would not discover this fact\r\nuntil they had made a sad mess of society They had the votes and the\r\npower to do so if they pleased, and their leaders meant they should.\r\nSome of these desponding observers went so far as to predict an\r\nimpending social cataclysm. Humanity, they argued, having climbed to\r\nthe top round of the ladder of civilization, was about to take a\r\nheader into chaos, after which it would doubtless pick itself up, turn\r\nround, and begin to climb again. Repeated experiences of this sort in\r\nhistoric and prehistoric times possibly accounted for the puzzling\r\nbumps on the human cranium. Human history, like all great movements,\r\nwas cyclical, and returned to the point of beginning. The idea of\r\nindefinite progress in a right line was a chimera of the imagination,\r\nwith no analogue in nature. The parabola of a comet was perhaps a yet\r\nbetter illustration of the career of humanity. Tending upward and\r\nsunward from the aphelion of barbarism, the race attained the\r\nperihelion of civilization only to plunge downward once more to its\r\nnether goal in the regions of chaos.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, was an extreme opinion, but I remember serious men\r\namong my acquaintances who, in discussing the signs of the times,\r\nadopted a very similar tone. It was no doubt the common opinion of\r\nthoughtful men that society was approaching a critical period which\r\nmight result in great changes. The labor troubles, their causes,\r\ncourse, and cure, took lead of all other topics in the public prints,\r\nand in serious conversation.\r\n\r\nThe nervous tension of the public mind could not have been more\r\nstrikingly illustrated than it was by the alarm resulting from the\r\ntalk of a small band of men who called themselves anarchists, and\r\nproposed to terrify the American people into adopting their ideas by\r\nthreats of violence, as if a mighty nation which had but just put down\r\na rebellion of half its own numbers, in order to maintain its\r\npolitical system, were likely to adopt a new social system out of\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nAs one of the wealthy, with a large stake in the existing order of\r\nthings, I naturally shared the apprehensions of my class. The\r\nparticular grievance I had against the working classes at the time of\r\nwhich I write, on account of the effect of their strikes in postponing\r\nmy wedded bliss, no doubt lent a special animosity to my feeling\r\ntoward them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thirtieth day of May, 1887, fell on a Monday. It was one of the\r\nannual holidays of the nation in the latter third of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, being set apart under the name of Decoration Day, for doing\r\nhonor to the memory of the soldiers of the North who took part in the\r\nwar for the preservation of the union of the States. The survivors of\r\nthe war, escorted by military and civic processions and bands of\r\nmusic, were wont on this occasion to visit the cemeteries and lay\r\nwreaths of flowers upon the graves of their dead comrades, the\r\nceremony being a very solemn and touching one. The eldest brother of\r\nEdith Bartlett had fallen in the war, and on Decoration Day the family\r\nwas in the habit of making a visit to Mount Auburn, where he lay.\r\n\r\nI had asked permission to make one of the party, and, on our return to\r\nthe city at nightfall, remained to dine with the family of my\r\nbetrothed. In the drawing-room, after dinner, I picked up an evening\r\npaper and read of a fresh strike in the building trades, which would\r\nprobably still further delay the completion of my unlucky house. I\r\nremember distinctly how exasperated I was at this, and the\r\nobjurgations, as forcible as the presence of the ladies permitted,\r\nwhich I lavished upon workmen in general, and these strikers in\r\nparticular. I had abundant sympathy from those about me, and the\r\nremarks made in the desultory conversation which followed, upon the\r\nunprincipled conduct of the labor agitators, were calculated to make\r\nthose gentlemen\'s ears tingle. It was agreed that affairs were going\r\nfrom bad to worse very fast, and that there was no telling what we\r\nshould come to soon. "The worst of it," I remember Mrs. Bartlett\'s\r\nsaying, "is that the working classes all over the world seem to be\r\ngoing crazy at once. In Europe it is far worse even than here. I\'m\r\nsure I should not dare to live there at all. I asked Mr. Bartlett the\r\nother day where we should emigrate to if all the terrible things took\r\nplace which those socialists threaten. He said he did not know any\r\nplace now where society could be called stable except Greenland,\r\nPatagonia, and the Chinese Empire." "Those Chinamen knew what they\r\nwere about," somebody added, "when they refused to let in our western\r\ncivilization. They knew what it would lead to better than we did. They\r\nsaw it was nothing but dynamite in disguise."\r\n\r\nAfter this, I remember drawing Edith apart and trying to persuade her\r\nthat it would be better to be married at once without waiting for the\r\ncompletion of the house, spending the time in travel till our home\r\nwas ready for us. She was remarkably handsome that evening, the\r\nmourning costume that she wore in recognition of the day setting off\r\nto great advantage the purity of her complexion. I can see her even\r\nnow with my mind\'s eye just as she looked that night. When I took my\r\nleave she followed me into the hall and I kissed her good-by as usual.\r\nThere was no circumstance out of the common to distinguish this\r\nparting from previous occasions when we had bade each other good-by\r\nfor a night or a day. There was absolutely no premonition in my mind,\r\nor I am sure in hers, that this was more than an ordinary separation.\r\n\r\nAh, well!\r\n\r\nThe hour at which I had left my betrothed was a rather early one for a\r\nlover, but the fact was no reflection on my devotion. I was a\r\nconfirmed sufferer from insomnia, and although otherwise perfectly\r\nwell had been completely fagged out that day, from having slept\r\nscarcely at all the two previous nights. Edith knew this and had\r\ninsisted on sending me home by nine o\'clock, with strict orders to go\r\nto bed at once.\r\n\r\nThe house in which I lived had been occupied by three generations of\r\nthe family of which I was the only living representative in the direct\r\nline. It was a large, ancient wooden mansion, very elegant in an\r\nold-fashioned way within, but situated in a quarter that had long\r\nsince become undesirable for residence, from its invasion by tenement\r\nhouses and manufactories. It was not a house to which I could think of\r\nbringing a bride, much less so dainty a one as Edith Bartlett. I had\r\nadvertised it for sale, and meanwhile merely used it for sleeping\r\npurposes, dining at my club. One servant, a faithful colored man by\r\nthe name of Sawyer, lived with me and attended to my few wants. One\r\nfeature of the house I expected to miss greatly when I should leave\r\nit, and this was the sleeping chamber which I had built under the\r\nfoundations. I could not have slept in the city at all, with its never\r\nceasing nightly noises, if I had been obliged to use an upstairs\r\nchamber. But to this subterranean room no murmur from the upper world\r\never penetrated. When I had entered it and closed the door, I was\r\nsurrounded by the silence of the tomb. In order to prevent the\r\ndampness of the subsoil from penetrating the chamber, the walls had\r\nbeen laid in hydraulic cement and were very thick, and the floor was\r\nlikewise protected. In order that the room might serve also as a vault\r\nequally proof against violence and flames, for the storage of\r\nvaluables, I had roofed it with stone slabs hermetically sealed, and\r\nthe outer door was of iron with a thick coating of asbestos. A small\r\npipe, communicating with a wind-mill on the top of the house, insured\r\nthe renewal of air.\r\n\r\nIt might seem that the tenant of such a chamber ought to be able to\r\ncommand slumber, but it was rare that I slept well, even there, two\r\nnights in succession. So accustomed was I to wakefulness that I minded\r\nlittle the loss of one night\'s rest. A second night, however, spent in\r\nmy reading chair instead of my bed, tired me out, and I never allowed\r\nmyself to go longer than that without slumber, from fear of nervous\r\ndisorder. From this statement it will be inferred that I had at my\r\ncommand some artificial means for inducing sleep in the last resort,\r\nand so in fact I had. If after two sleepless nights I found myself on\r\nthe approach of the third without sensations of drowsiness, I called\r\nin Dr. Pillsbury.\r\n\r\nHe was a doctor by courtesy only, what was called in those days an\r\n"irregular" or "quack" doctor. He called himself a "Professor of\r\nAnimal Magnetism." I had come across him in the course of some amateur\r\ninvestigations into the phenomena of animal magnetism. I don\'t think\r\nhe knew anything about medicine, but he was certainly a remarkable\r\nmesmerist. It was for the purpose of being put to sleep by his\r\nmanipulations that I used to send for him when I found a third night\r\nof sleeplessness impending. Let my nervous excitement or mental\r\npreoccupation be however great, Dr. Pillsbury never failed, after a\r\nshort time, to leave me in a deep slumber, which continued till I was\r\naroused by a reversal of the mesmerizing process. The process for\r\nawaking the sleeper was much simpler than that for putting him to\r\nsleep, and for convenience I had made Dr. Pillsbury teach Sawyer how\r\nto do it.\r\n\r\nMy faithful servant alone knew for what purpose Dr. Pillsbury visited\r\nme, or that he did so at all. Of course, when Edith became my wife I\r\nshould have to tell her my secrets. I had not hitherto told her this,\r\nbecause there was unquestionably a slight risk in the mesmeric sleep,\r\nand I knew she would set her face against my practice. The risk, of\r\ncourse, was that it might become too profound and pass into a trance\r\nbeyond the mesmerizer\'s power to break, ending in death. Repeated\r\nexperiments had fully convinced me that the risk was next to nothing\r\nif reasonable precautions were exercised, and of this I hoped, though\r\ndoubtingly, to convince Edith. I went directly home after leaving her,\r\nand at once sent Sawyer to fetch Dr. Pillsbury. Meanwhile I sought my\r\nsubterranean sleeping chamber, and exchanging my costume for a\r\ncomfortable dressing-gown, sat down to read the letters by the evening\r\nmail which Sawyer had laid on my reading table.\r\n\r\nOne of them was from the builder of my new house, and confirmed what I\r\nhad inferred from the newspaper item. The new strikes, he said, had\r\npostponed indefinitely the completion of the contract, as neither\r\nmasters nor workmen would concede the point at issue without a long\r\nstruggle. Caligula wished that the Roman people had but one neck that\r\nhe might cut it off, and as I read this letter I am afraid that for a\r\nmoment I was capable of wishing the same thing concerning the laboring\r\nclasses of America. The return of Sawyer with the doctor interrupted\r\nmy gloomy meditations.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that he had with difficulty been able to secure his\r\nservices, as he was preparing to leave the city that very night. The\r\ndoctor explained that since he had seen me last he had learned of a\r\nfine professional opening in a distant city, and decided to take\r\nprompt advantage of it. On my asking, in some panic, what I was to do\r\nfor some one to put me to sleep, he gave me the names of several\r\nmesmerizers in Boston who, he averred, had quite as great powers as\r\nhe.\r\n\r\nSomewhat relieved on this point, I instructed Sawyer to rouse me at\r\nnine o\'clock next morning, and, lying down on the bed in my\r\ndressing-gown, assumed a comfortable attitude, and surrendered myself\r\nto the manipulations of the mesmerizer. Owing, perhaps, to my\r\nunusually nervous state, I was slower than common in losing\r\nconsciousness, but at length a delicious drowsiness stole over me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n"He is going to open his eyes. He had better see but one of us at\r\nfirst."\r\n\r\n"Promise me, then, that you will not tell him."\r\n\r\nThe first voice was a man\'s, the second a woman\'s, and both spoke in\r\nwhispers.\r\n\r\n"I will see how he seems," replied the man.\r\n\r\n"No, no, promise me," persisted the other.\r\n\r\n"Let her have her way," whispered a third voice, also a woman.\r\n\r\n"Well, well, I promise, then," answered the man. "Quick, go! He is\r\ncoming out of it."\r\n\r\nThere was a rustle of garments and I opened my eyes. A fine looking\r\nman of perhaps sixty was bending over me, an expression of much\r\nbenevolence mingled with great curiosity upon his features. He was an\r\nutter stranger. I raised myself on an elbow and looked around. The\r\nroom was empty. I certainly had never been in it before, or one\r\nfurnished like it. I looked back at my companion. He smiled.\r\n\r\n"How do you feel?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Where am I?" I demanded.\r\n\r\n"You are in my house," was the reply.\r\n\r\n"How came I here?"\r\n\r\n"We will talk about that when you are stronger. Meanwhile, I beg you\r\nwill feel no anxiety. You are among friends and in good hands. How do\r\nyou feel?"\r\n\r\n"A bit queerly," I replied, "but I am well, I suppose. Will you tell\r\nme how I came to be indebted to your hospitality? What has happened to\r\nme? How came I here? It was in my own house that I went to sleep."\r\n\r\n"There will be time enough for explanations later," my unknown host\r\nreplied, with a reassuring smile. "It will be better to avoid\r\nagitating talk until you are a little more yourself. Will you oblige\r\nme by taking a couple of swallows of this mixture? It will do you\r\ngood. I am a physician."\r\n\r\nI repelled the glass with my hand and sat up on the couch, although\r\nwith an effort, for my head was strangely light.\r\n\r\n"I insist upon knowing at once where I am and what you have been doing\r\nwith me," I said.\r\n\r\n"My dear sir," responded my companion, "let me beg that you will not\r\nagitate yourself. I would rather you did not insist upon explanations\r\nso soon, but if you do, I will try to satisfy you, provided you will\r\nfirst take this draught, which will strengthen you somewhat."\r\n\r\nI thereupon drank what he offered me. Then he said, "It is not so\r\nsimple a matter as you evidently suppose to tell you how you came\r\nhere. You can tell me quite as much on that point as I can tell you.\r\nYou have just been roused from a deep sleep, or, more properly,\r\ntrance. So much I can tell you. You say you were in your own house\r\nwhen you fell into that sleep. May I ask you when that was?"\r\n\r\n"When?" I replied, "when? Why, last evening, of course, at about ten\r\no\'clock. I left my man Sawyer orders to call me at nine o\'clock. What\r\nhas become of Sawyer?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t precisely tell you that," replied my companion, regarding me\r\nwith a curious expression, "but I am sure that he is excusable for not\r\nbeing here. And now can you tell me a little more explicitly when it\r\nwas that you fell into that sleep, the date, I mean?"\r\n\r\n"Why, last night, of course; I said so, didn\'t I? that is, unless I\r\nhave overslept an entire day. Great heavens! that cannot be possible;\r\nand yet I have an odd sensation of having slept a long time. It was\r\nDecoration Day that I went to sleep."\r\n\r\n"Decoration Day?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Monday, the 30th."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me, the 30th of what?"\r\n\r\n"Why, of this month, of course, unless I have slept into June, but\r\nthat can\'t be."\r\n\r\n"This month is September."\r\n\r\n"September! You don\'t mean that I\'ve slept since May! God in heaven!\r\nWhy, it is incredible."\r\n\r\n"We shall see," replied my companion; "you say that it was May 30th\r\nwhen you went to sleep?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"May I ask of what year?"\r\n\r\nI stared blankly at him, incapable of speech, for some moments.\r\n\r\n"Of what year?" I feebly echoed at last.\r\n\r\n"Yes, of what year, if you please? After you have told me that I shall\r\nbe able to tell you how long you have slept."\r\n\r\n"It was the year 1887," I said.\r\n\r\nMy companion insisted that I should take another draught from the\r\nglass, and felt my pulse.\r\n\r\n"My dear sir," he said, "your manner indicates that you are a man of\r\nculture, which I am aware was by no means the matter of course in your\r\nday it now is. No doubt, then, you have yourself made the observation\r\nthat nothing in this world can be truly said to be more wonderful than\r\nanything else. The causes of all phenomena are equally adequate, and\r\nthe results equally matters of course. That you should be startled by\r\nwhat I shall tell you is to be expected; but I am confident that you\r\nwill not permit it to affect your equanimity unduly. Your appearance\r\nis that of a young man of barely thirty, and your bodily condition\r\nseems not greatly different from that of one just roused from a\r\nsomewhat too long and profound sleep, and yet this is the tenth day\r\nof September in the year 2000, and you have slept exactly one hundred\r\nand thirteen years, three months, and eleven days."\r\n\r\nFeeling partially dazed, I drank a cup of some sort of broth at my\r\ncompanion\'s suggestion, and, immediately afterward becoming very\r\ndrowsy, went off into a deep sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke it was broad daylight in the room, which had been lighted\r\nartificially when I was awake before. My mysterious host was sitting\r\nnear. He was not looking at me when I opened my eyes, and I had a good\r\nopportunity to study him and meditate upon my extraordinary situation,\r\nbefore he observed that I was awake. My giddiness was all gone, and my\r\nmind perfectly clear. The story that I had been asleep one hundred and\r\nthirteen years, which, in my former weak and bewildered condition, I\r\nhad accepted without question, recurred to me now only to be rejected\r\nas a preposterous attempt at an imposture, the motive of which it was\r\nimpossible remotely to surmise.\r\n\r\nSomething extraordinary had certainly happened to account for my\r\nwaking up in this strange house with this unknown companion, but my\r\nfancy was utterly impotent to suggest more than than the wildest guess\r\nas to what that something might have been. Could it be that I was the\r\nvictim of some sort of conspiracy? It looked so, certainly; and yet,\r\nif human lineaments ever gave true evidence, it was certain that this\r\nman by my side, with a face so refined and ingenuous, was no party to\r\nany scheme of crime or outrage. Then it occurred to me to question if\r\nI might not be the butt of some elaborate practical joke on the part\r\nof friends who had somehow learned the secret of my underground\r\nchamber and taken this means of impressing me with the peril of\r\nmesmeric experiments. There were great difficulties in the way of this\r\ntheory; Sawyer would never have betrayed me, nor had I any friends at\r\nall likely to undertake such an enterprise; nevertheless the\r\nsupposition that I was the victim of a practical joke seemed on the\r\nwhole the only one tenable. Half expecting to catch a glimpse of some\r\nfamiliar face grinning from behind a chair or curtain, I looked\r\ncarefully about the room. When my eyes next rested on my companion, he\r\nwas looking at me.\r\n\r\n"You have had a fine nap of twelve hours," he said briskly, "and I can\r\nsee that it has done you good. You look much better. Your color is\r\ngood and your eyes are bright. How do you feel?"\r\n\r\n"I never felt better," I said, sitting up.\r\n\r\n"You remember your first waking, no doubt," he pursued, "and your\r\nsurprise when I told you how long you had been asleep?"\r\n\r\n"You said, I believe, that I had slept one hundred and thirteen\r\nyears."\r\n\r\n"Exactly."\r\n\r\n"You will admit," I said, with an ironical smile, "that the story was\r\nrather an improbable one."\r\n\r\n"Extraordinary, I admit," he responded, "but given the proper\r\nconditions, not improbable nor inconsistent with what we know of the\r\ntrance state. When complete, as in your case, the vital functions are\r\nabsolutely suspended, and there is no waste of the tissues. No limit\r\ncan be set to the possible duration of a trance when the external\r\nconditions protect the body from physical injury. This trance of yours\r\nis indeed the longest of which there is any positive record, but there\r\nis no known reason wherefore, had you not been discovered and had the\r\nchamber in which we found you continued intact, you might not have\r\nremained in a state of suspended animation till, at the end of\r\nindefinite ages, the gradual refrigeration of the earth had destroyed\r\nthe bodily tissues and set the spirit free."\r\n\r\nI had to admit that, if I were indeed the victim of a practical joke,\r\nits authors had chosen an admirable agent for carrying out their\r\nimposition. The impressive and even eloquent manner of this man would\r\nhave lent dignity to an argument that the moon was made of cheese. The\r\nsmile with which I had regarded him as he advanced his trance\r\nhypothesis did not appear to confuse him in the slightest degree.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," I said, "you will go on and favor me with some particulars\r\nas to the circumstances under which you discovered this chamber of\r\nwhich you speak, and its contents. I enjoy good fiction."\r\n\r\n"In this case," was the grave reply, "no fiction could be so strange\r\nas the truth. You must know that these many years I have been\r\ncherishing the idea of building a laboratory in the large garden\r\nbeside this house, for the purpose of chemical experiments for which I\r\nhave a taste. Last Thursday the excavation for the cellar was at last\r\nbegun. It was completed by that night, and Friday the masons were to\r\nhave come. Thursday night we had a tremendous deluge of rain, and\r\nFriday morning I found my cellar a frog-pond and the walls quite\r\nwashed down. My daughter, who had come out to view the disaster with\r\nme, called my attention to a corner of masonry laid bare by the\r\ncrumbling away of one of the walls. I cleared a little earth from it,\r\nand, finding that it seemed part of a large mass, determined to\r\ninvestigate it. The workmen I sent for unearthed an oblong vault some\r\neight feet below the surface, and set in the corner of what had\r\nevidently been the foundation walls of an ancient house. A layer of\r\nashes and charcoal on the top of the vault showed that the house above\r\nhad perished by fire. The vault itself was perfectly intact, the\r\ncement being as good as when first applied. It had a door, but this we\r\ncould not force, and found entrance by removing one of the flagstones\r\nwhich formed the roof. The air which came up was stagnant but pure,\r\ndry and not cold. Descending with a lantern, I found myself in an\r\napartment fitted up as a bedroom in the style of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. On the bed lay a young man. That he was dead and must have\r\nbeen dead a century was of course to be taken for granted; but the\r\nextraordinary state of preservation of the body struck me and the\r\nmedical colleagues whom I had summoned with amazement. That the art of\r\nsuch embalming as this had ever been known we should not have\r\nbelieved, yet here seemed conclusive testimony that our immediate\r\nancestors had possessed it. My medical colleagues, whose curiosity was\r\nhighly excited, were at once for undertaking experiments to test the\r\nnature of the process employed, but I withheld them. My motive in so\r\ndoing, at least the only motive I now need speak of, was the\r\nrecollection of something I once had read about the extent to which\r\nyour contemporaries had cultivated the subject of animal magnetism. It\r\nhad occurred to me as just conceivable that you might be in a trance,\r\nand that the secret of your bodily integrity after so long a time was\r\nnot the craft of an embalmer, but life. So extremely fanciful did this\r\nidea seem, even to me, that I did not risk the ridicule of my fellow\r\nphysicians by mentioning it, but gave some other reason for postponing\r\ntheir experiments. No sooner, however, had they left me, than I set on\r\nfoot a systematic attempt at resuscitation, of which you know the\r\nresult."\r\n\r\nHad its theme been yet more incredible, the circumstantiality of this\r\nnarrative, as well as the impressive manner and personality of the\r\nnarrator, might have staggered a listener, and I had begun to feel\r\nvery strangely, when, as he closed, I chanced to catch a glimpse of my\r\nreflection in a mirror hanging on the wall of the room. I rose and\r\nwent up to it. The face I saw was the face to a hair and a line and\r\nnot a day older than the one I had looked at as I tied my cravat\r\nbefore going to Edith that Decoration Day, which, as this man would\r\nhave me believe, was celebrated one hundred and thirteen years before.\r\nAt this, the colossal character of the fraud which was being attempted\r\non me, came over me afresh. Indignation mastered my mind as I realized\r\nthe outrageous liberty that had been taken.\r\n\r\n"You are probably surprised," said my companion, "to see that,\r\nalthough you are a century older than when you lay down to sleep in\r\nthat underground chamber, your appearance is unchanged. That should\r\nnot amaze you. It is by virtue of the total arrest of the vital\r\nfunctions that you have survived this great period of time. If your\r\nbody could have undergone any change during your trance, it would long\r\nago have suffered dissolution."\r\n\r\n"Sir," I replied, turning to him, "what your motive can be in reciting\r\nto me with a serious face this remarkable farrago, I am utterly unable\r\nto guess; but you are surely yourself too intelligent to suppose that\r\nanybody but an imbecile could be deceived by it. Spare me any more of\r\nthis elaborate nonsense and once for all tell me whether you refuse to\r\ngive me an intelligible account of where I am and how I came here. If\r\nso, I shall proceed to ascertain my whereabouts for myself, whoever\r\nmay hinder."\r\n\r\n"You do not, then, believe that this is the year 2000?"\r\n\r\n"Do you really think it necessary to ask me that?" I returned.\r\n\r\n"Very well," replied my extraordinary host. "Since I cannot convince\r\nyou, you shall convince yourself. Are you strong enough to follow me\r\nupstairs?"\r\n\r\n"I am as strong as I ever was," I replied angrily, "as I may have to\r\nprove if this jest is carried much farther."\r\n\r\n"I beg, sir," was my companion\'s response, "that you will not allow\r\nyourself to be too fully persuaded that you are the victim of a trick,\r\nlest the reaction, when you are convinced of the truth of my\r\nstatements, should be too great."\r\n\r\nThe tone of concern, mingled with commiseration, with which he said\r\nthis, and the entire absence of any sign of resentment at my hot\r\nwords, strangely daunted me, and I followed him from the room with an\r\nextraordinary mixture of emotions. He led the way up two flights of\r\nstairs and then up a shorter one, which landed us upon a belvedere on\r\nthe house-top. "Be pleased to look around you," he said, as we reached\r\nthe platform, "and tell me if this is the Boston of the nineteenth\r\ncentury."\r\n\r\nAt my feet lay a great city. Miles of broad streets, shaded by trees\r\nand lined with fine buildings, for the most part not in continuous\r\nblocks but set in larger or smaller inclosures, stretched in every\r\ndirection. Every quarter contained large open squares filled with\r\ntrees, among which statues glistened and fountains flashed in the late\r\nafternoon sun. Public buildings of a colossal size and an\r\narchitectural grandeur unparalleled in my day raised their stately\r\npiles on every side. Surely I had never seen this city nor one\r\ncomparable to it before. Raising my eyes at last towards the horizon,\r\nI looked westward. That blue ribbon winding away to the sunset, was it\r\nnot the sinuous Charles? I looked east; Boston harbor stretched before\r\nme within its headlands, not one of its green islets missing.\r\n\r\nI knew then that I had been told the truth concerning the prodigious\r\nthing which had befallen me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nI did not faint, but the effort to realize my position made me very\r\ngiddy, and I remember that my companion had to give me a strong arm as\r\nhe conducted me from the roof to a roomy apartment on the upper floor\r\nof the house, where he insisted on my drinking a glass or two of good\r\nwine and partaking of a light repast.\r\n\r\n"I think you are going to be all right now," he said cheerily. "I\r\nshould not have taken so abrupt a means to convince you of your\r\nposition if your course, while perfectly excusable under the\r\ncircumstances, had not rather obliged me to do so. I confess," he\r\nadded laughing, "I was a little apprehensive at one time that I should\r\nundergo what I believe you used to call a knockdown in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, if I did not act rather promptly. I remembered that the\r\nBostonians of your day were famous pugilists, and thought best to lose\r\nno time. I take it you are now ready to acquit me of the charge of\r\nhoaxing you."\r\n\r\n"If you had told me," I replied, profoundly awed, "that a thousand\r\nyears instead of a hundred had elapsed since I last looked on this\r\ncity, I should now believe you."\r\n\r\n"Only a century has passed," he answered, "but many a millennium in\r\nthe world\'s history has seen changes less extraordinary."\r\n\r\n"And now," he added, extending his hand with an air of irresistible\r\ncordiality, "let me give you a hearty welcome to the Boston of the\r\ntwentieth century and to this house. My name is Leete, Dr. Leete they\r\ncall me."\r\n\r\n"My name," I said as I shook his hand, "is Julian West."\r\n\r\n"I am most happy in making your acquaintance, Mr. West," he responded.\r\n"Seeing that this house is built on the site of your own, I hope you\r\nwill find it easy to make yourself at home in it."\r\n\r\nAfter my refreshment Dr. Leete offered me a bath and a change of\r\nclothing, of which I gladly availed myself.\r\n\r\nIt did not appear that any very startling revolution in men\'s attire\r\nhad been among the great changes my host had spoken of, for, barring a\r\nfew details, my new habiliments did not puzzle me at all.\r\n\r\nPhysically, I was now myself again. But mentally, how was it with me,\r\nthe reader will doubtless wonder. What were my intellectual\r\nsensations, he may wish to know, on finding myself so suddenly dropped\r\nas it were into a new world. In reply let me ask him to suppose\r\nhimself suddenly, in the twinkling of an eye, transported from earth,\r\nsay, to Paradise or Hades. What does he fancy would be his own\r\nexperience? Would his thoughts return at once to the earth he had just\r\nleft, or would he, after the first shock, wellnigh forget his former\r\nlife for a while, albeit to be remembered later, in the interest\r\nexcited by his new surroundings? All I can say is, that if his\r\nexperience were at all like mine in the transition I am describing,\r\nthe latter hypothesis would prove the correct one. The impressions of\r\namazement and curiosity which my new surroundings produced occupied my\r\nmind, after the first shock, to the exclusion of all other thoughts.\r\nFor the time the memory of my former life was, as it were, in\r\nabeyance.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did I find myself physically rehabilitated through the kind\r\noffices of my host, than I became eager to return to the house-top;\r\nand presently we were comfortably established there in easy-chairs,\r\nwith the city beneath and around us. After Dr. Leete had responded to\r\nnumerous questions on my part, as to the ancient landmarks I missed\r\nand the new ones which had replaced them, he asked me what point of\r\nthe contrast between the new and the old city struck me most forcibly.\r\n\r\n"To speak of small things before great," I responded, "I really think\r\nthat the complete absence of chimneys and their smoke is the detail\r\nthat first impressed me."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" ejaculated my companion with an air of much interest, "I had\r\nforgotten the chimneys, it is so long since they went out of use. It\r\nis nearly a century since the crude method of combustion on which you\r\ndepended for heat became obsolete."\r\n\r\n"In general," I said, "what impresses me most about the city is the\r\nmaterial prosperity on the part of the people which its magnificence\r\nimplies."\r\n\r\n"I would give a great deal for just one glimpse of the Boston of your\r\nday," replied Dr. Leete. "No doubt, as you imply, the cities of that\r\nperiod were rather shabby affairs. If you had the taste to make them\r\nsplendid, which I would not be so rude as to question, the general\r\npoverty resulting from your extraordinary industrial system would not\r\nhave given you the means. Moreover, the excessive individualism which\r\nthen prevailed was inconsistent with much public spirit. What little\r\nwealth you had seems almost wholly to have been lavished in private\r\nluxury. Nowadays, on the contrary, there is no destination of the\r\nsurplus wealth so popular as the adornment of the city, which all\r\nenjoy in equal degree."\r\n\r\nThe sun had been setting as we returned to the house-top, and as we\r\ntalked night descended upon the city.\r\n\r\n"It is growing dark," said Dr. Leete. "Let us descend into the house;\r\nI want to introduce my wife and daughter to you."\r\n\r\nHis words recalled to me the feminine voices which I had heard\r\nwhispering about me as I was coming back to conscious life; and, most\r\ncurious to learn what the ladies of the year 2000 were like, I\r\nassented with alacrity to the proposition. The apartment in which we\r\nfound the wife and daughter of my host, as well as the entire interior\r\nof the house, was filled with a mellow light, which I knew must be\r\nartificial, although I could not discover the source from which it was\r\ndiffused. Mrs. Leete was an exceptionally fine looking and well\r\npreserved woman of about her husband\'s age, while the daughter, who\r\nwas in the first blush of womanhood, was the most beautiful girl I had\r\never seen. Her face was as bewitching as deep blue eyes, delicately\r\ntinted complexion, and perfect features could make it, but even had\r\nher countenance lacked special charms, the faultless luxuriance of her\r\nfigure would have given her place as a beauty among the women of the\r\nnineteenth century. Feminine softness and delicacy were in this lovely\r\ncreature deliciously combined with an appearance of health and\r\nabounding physical vitality too often lacking in the maidens with whom\r\nalone I could compare her. It was a coincidence trifling in comparison\r\nwith the general strangeness of the situation, but still striking,\r\nthat her name should be Edith.\r\n\r\nThe evening that followed was certainly unique in the history of\r\nsocial intercourse, but to suppose that our conversation was\r\npeculiarly strained or difficult would be a great mistake. I believe\r\nindeed that it is under what may be called unnatural, in the sense of\r\nextraordinary, circumstances that people behave most naturally, for\r\nthe reason, no doubt, that such circumstances banish artificiality. I\r\nknow at any rate that my intercourse that evening with these\r\nrepresentatives of another age and world was marked by an ingenuous\r\nsincerity and frankness such as but rarely crown long acquaintance. No\r\ndoubt the exquisite tact of my entertainers had much to do with this.\r\nOf course there was nothing we could talk of but the strange\r\nexperience by virtue of which I was there, but they talked of it with\r\nan interest so naive and direct in its expression as to relieve the\r\nsubject to a great degree of the element of the weird and the uncanny\r\nwhich might so easily have been overpowering. One would have supposed\r\nthat they were quite in the habit of entertaining waifs from another\r\ncentury, so perfect was their tact.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, never do I remember the operations of my mind to have\r\nbeen more alert and acute than that evening, or my intellectual\r\nsensibilities more keen. Of course I do not mean that the\r\nconsciousness of my amazing situation was for a moment out of mind,\r\nbut its chief effect thus far was to produce a feverish elation, a\r\nsort of mental intoxication.[1]\r\n\r\nEdith Leete took little part in the conversation, but when several\r\ntimes the magnetism of her beauty drew my glance to her face, I found\r\nher eyes fixed on me with an absorbed intensity, almost like\r\nfascination. It was evident that I had excited her interest to an\r\nextraordinary degree, as was not astonishing, supposing her to be a\r\ngirl of imagination. Though I supposed curiosity was the chief motive\r\nof her interest, it could but affect me as it would not have done had\r\nshe been less beautiful.\r\n\r\nDr. Leete, as well as the ladies, seemed greatly interested in my\r\naccount of the circumstances under which I had gone to sleep in the\r\nunderground chamber. All had suggestions to offer to account for my\r\nhaving been forgotten there, and the theory which we finally agreed on\r\noffers at least a plausible explanation, although whether it be in its\r\ndetails the true one, nobody, of course, will ever know. The layer of\r\nashes found above the chamber indicated that the house had been burned\r\ndown. Let it be supposed that the conflagration had taken place the\r\nnight I fell asleep. It only remains to assume that Sawyer lost his\r\nlife in the fire or by some accident connected with it, and the rest\r\nfollows naturally enough. No one but he and Dr. Pillsbury either knew\r\nof the existence of the chamber or that I was in it, and Dr.\r\nPillsbury, who had gone that night to New Orleans, had probably never\r\nheard of the fire at all. The conclusion of my friends, and of the\r\npublic, must have been that I had perished in the flames. An\r\nexcavation of the ruins, unless thorough, would not have disclosed the\r\nrecess in the foundation walls connecting with my chamber. To be sure,\r\nif the site had been again built upon, at least immediately, such an\r\nexcavation would have been necessary, but the troublous times and the\r\nundesirable character of the locality might well have prevented\r\nrebuilding. The size of the trees in the garden now occupying the site\r\nindicated, Dr. Leete said, that for more than half a century at least\r\nit had been open ground.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In accounting for this state of mind it must be\r\nremembered that, except for the topic of our conversations, there was\r\nin my surroundings next to nothing to suggest what had befallen me.\r\nWithin a block of my home in the old Boston I could have found social\r\ncircles vastly more foreign to me. The speech of the Bostonians of the\r\ntwentieth century differs even less from that of their cultured\r\nancestors of the nineteenth than did that of the latter from the\r\nlanguage of Washington and Franklin, while the differences between the\r\nstyle of dress and furniture of the two epochs are not more marked\r\nthan I have known fashion to make in the time of one generation.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, in the course of the evening the ladies retired, leaving Dr.\r\nLeete and myself alone, he sounded me as to my disposition for sleep,\r\nsaying that if I felt like it my bed was ready for me; but if I was\r\ninclined to wakefulness nothing would please him better than to bear\r\nme company. "I am a late bird, myself," he said, "and, without\r\nsuspicion of flattery, I may say that a companion more interesting\r\nthan yourself could scarcely be imagined. It is decidedly not often\r\nthat one has a chance to converse with a man of the nineteenth\r\ncentury."\r\n\r\nNow I had been looking forward all the evening with some dread to the\r\ntime when I should be alone, on retiring for the night. Surrounded by\r\nthese most friendly strangers, stimulated and supported by their\r\nsympathetic interest, I had been able to keep my mental balance. Even\r\nthen, however, in pauses of the conversation I had had glimpses, vivid\r\nas lightning flashes, of the horror of strangeness that was waiting to\r\nbe faced when I could no longer command diversion. I knew I could not\r\nsleep that night, and as for lying awake and thinking, it argues no\r\ncowardice, I am sure, to confess that I was afraid of it. When, in\r\nreply to my host\'s question, I frankly told him this, he replied that\r\nit would be strange if I did not feel just so, but that I need have no\r\nanxiety about sleeping; whenever I wanted to go to bed, he would give\r\nme a dose which would insure me a sound night\'s sleep without fail.\r\nNext morning, no doubt, I would awake with the feeling of an old\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\n"Before I acquire that," I replied, "I must know a little more about\r\nthe sort of Boston I have come back to. You told me when we were upon\r\nthe house-top that though a century only had elapsed since I fell\r\nasleep, it had been marked by greater changes in the conditions of\r\nhumanity than many a previous millennium. With the city before me I\r\ncould well believe that, but I am very curious to know what some of\r\nthe changes have been. To make a beginning somewhere, for the subject\r\nis doubtless a large one, what solution, if any, have you found for\r\nthe labor question? It was the Sphinx\'s riddle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, and when I dropped out the Sphinx was threatening to devour\r\nsociety, because the answer was not forthcoming. It is well worth\r\nsleeping a hundred years to learn what the right answer was, if,\r\nindeed, you have found it yet."\r\n\r\n"As no such thing as the labor question is known nowadays," replied\r\nDr. Leete, "and there is no way in which it could arise, I suppose we\r\nmay claim to have solved it. Society would indeed have fully deserved\r\nbeing devoured if it had failed to answer a riddle so entirely simple.\r\nIn fact, to speak by the book, it was not necessary for society to\r\nsolve the riddle at all. It may be said to have solved itself. The\r\nsolution came as the result of a process of industrial evolution which\r\ncould not have terminated otherwise. All that society had to do was to\r\nrecognize and cooperate with that evolution, when its tendency had\r\nbecome unmistakable."\r\n\r\n"I can only say," I answered, "that at the time I fell asleep no such\r\nevolution had been recognized."\r\n\r\n"It was in 1887 that you fell into this sleep, I think you said."\r\n\r\n"Yes, May 30th, 1887."\r\n\r\nMy companion regarded me musingly for some moments. Then he observed,\r\n"And you tell me that even then there was no general recognition of\r\nthe nature of the crisis which society was nearing? Of course, I fully\r\ncredit your statement. The singular blindness of your contemporaries\r\nto the signs of the times is a phenomenon commented on by many of our\r\nhistorians, but few facts of history are more difficult for us to\r\nrealize, so obvious and unmistakable as we look back seem the\r\nindications, which must also have come under your eyes, of the\r\ntransformation about to come to pass. I should be interested, Mr.\r\nWest, if you would give me a little more definite idea of the view\r\nwhich you and men of your grade of intellect took of the state and\r\nprospects of society in 1887. You must, at least, have realized that\r\nthe widespread industrial and social troubles, and the underlying\r\ndissatisfaction of all classes with the inequalities of society, and\r\nthe general misery of mankind, were portents of great changes of some\r\nsort."\r\n\r\n"We did, indeed, fully realize that," I replied. "We felt that society\r\nwas dragging anchor and in danger of going adrift. Whither it would\r\ndrift nobody could say, but all feared the rocks."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless," said Dr. Leete, "the set of the current was perfectly\r\nperceptible if you had but taken pains to observe it, and it was not\r\ntoward the rocks, but toward a deeper channel."\r\n\r\n"We had a popular proverb," I replied, "that \'hindsight is better than\r\nforesight,\' the force of which I shall now, no doubt, appreciate more\r\nfully than ever. All I can say is, that the prospect was such when I\r\nwent into that long sleep that I should not have been surprised had I\r\nlooked down from your house-top to-day on a heap of charred and\r\nmoss-grown ruins instead of this glorious city."\r\n\r\nDr. Leete had listened to me with close attention and nodded\r\nthoughtfully as I finished speaking. "What you have said," he\r\nobserved, "will be regarded as a most valuable vindication of Storiot,\r\nwhose account of your era has been generally thought exaggerated in\r\nits picture of the gloom and confusion of men\'s minds. That a period\r\nof transition like that should be full of excitement and agitation was\r\nindeed to be looked for; but seeing how plain was the tendency of the\r\nforces in operation, it was natural to believe that hope rather than\r\nfear would have been the prevailing temper of the popular mind."\r\n\r\n"You have not yet told me what was the answer to the riddle which you\r\nfound," I said. "I am impatient to know by what contradiction of\r\nnatural sequence the peace and prosperity which you now seem to enjoy\r\ncould have been the outcome of an era like my own."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me," replied my host, "but do you smoke?" It was not till our\r\ncigars were lighted and drawing well that he resumed. "Since you are\r\nin the humor to talk rather than to sleep, as I certainly am, perhaps\r\nI cannot do better than to try to give you enough idea of our modern\r\nindustrial system to dissipate at least the impression that there is\r\nany mystery about the process of its evolution. The Bostonians of your\r\nday had the reputation of being great askers of questions, and I am\r\ngoing to show my descent by asking you one to begin with. What should\r\nyou name as the most prominent feature of the labor troubles of your\r\nday?"\r\n\r\n"Why, the strikes, of course," I replied.\r\n\r\n"Exactly; but what made the strikes so formidable?"\r\n\r\n"The great labor organizations."\r\n\r\n"And what was the motive of these great organizations?"\r\n\r\n"The workmen claimed they had to organize to get their rights from the\r\nbig corporations," I replied.\r\n\r\n"That is just it," said Dr. Leete; "the organization of labor and the\r\nstrikes were an effect, merely, of the concentration of capital in\r\ngreater masses than had ever been known before. Before this\r\nconcentration began, while as yet commerce and industry were conducted\r\nby innumerable petty concerns with small capital, instead of a small\r\nnumber of great concerns with vast capital, the individual workman was\r\nrelatively important and independent in his relations to the employer.\r\nMoreover, when a little capital or a new idea was enough to start a\r\nman in business for himself, workingmen were constantly becoming\r\nemployers and there was no hard and fast line between the two classes.\r\nLabor unions were needless then, and general strikes out of the\r\nquestion. But when the era of small concerns with small capital was\r\nsucceeded by that of the great aggregations of capital, all this was\r\nchanged. The individual laborer, who had been relatively important to\r\nthe small employer, was reduced to insignificance and powerlessness\r\nover against the great corporation, while at the same time the way\r\nupward to the grade of employer was closed to him. Self-defense drove\r\nhim to union with his fellows.\r\n\r\n"The records of the period show that the outcry against the\r\nconcentration of capital was furious. Men believed that it threatened\r\nsociety with a form of tyranny more abhorrent than it had ever\r\nendured. They believed that the great corporations were preparing for\r\nthem the yoke of a baser servitude than had ever been imposed on the\r\nrace, servitude not to men but to soulless machines incapable of any\r\nmotive but insatiable greed. Looking back, we cannot wonder at their\r\ndesperation, for certainly humanity was never confronted with a fate\r\nmore sordid and hideous than would have been the era of corporate\r\ntyranny which they anticipated.\r\n\r\n"Meanwhile, without being in the smallest degree checked by the clamor\r\nagainst it, the absorption of business by ever larger monopolies\r\ncontinued. In the United States there was not, after the beginning of\r\nthe last quarter of the century, any opportunity whatever for\r\nindividual enterprise in any important field of industry, unless\r\nbacked by a great capital. During the last decade of the century, such\r\nsmall businesses as still remained were fast-failing survivals of a\r\npast epoch, or mere parasites on the great corporations, or else\r\nexisted in fields too small to attract the great capitalists. Small\r\nbusinesses, as far as they still remained, were reduced to the\r\ncondition of rats and mice, living in holes and corners, and counting\r\non evading notice for the enjoyment of existence. The railroads had\r\ngone on combining till a few great syndicates controlled every rail in\r\nthe land. In manufactories, every important staple was controlled by a\r\nsyndicate. These syndicates, pools, trusts, or whatever their name,\r\nfixed prices and crushed all competition except when combinations as\r\nvast as themselves arose. Then a struggle, resulting in a still\r\ngreater consolidation, ensued. The great city bazar crushed its\r\ncountry rivals with branch stores, and in the city itself absorbed its\r\nsmaller rivals till the business of a whole quarter was concentrated\r\nunder one roof, with a hundred former proprietors of shops serving as\r\nclerks. Having no business of his own to put his money in, the small\r\ncapitalist, at the same time that he took service under the\r\ncorporation, found no other investment for his money but its stocks\r\nand bonds, thus becoming doubly dependent upon it.\r\n\r\n"The fact that the desperate popular opposition to the consolidation\r\nof business in a few powerful hands had no effect to check it proves\r\nthat there must have been a strong economical reason for it. The small\r\ncapitalists, with their innumerable petty concerns, had in fact\r\nyielded the field to the great aggregations of capital, because they\r\nbelonged to a day of small things and were totally incompetent to the\r\ndemands of an age of steam and telegraphs and the gigantic scale of\r\nits enterprises. To restore the former order of things, even if\r\npossible, would have involved returning to the day of stage-coaches.\r\nOppressive and intolerable as was the regime of the great\r\nconsolidations of capital, even its victims, while they cursed it,\r\nwere forced to admit the prodigious increase of efficiency which had\r\nbeen imparted to the national industries, the vast economies effected\r\nby concentration of management and unity of organization, and to\r\nconfess that since the new system had taken the place of the old the\r\nwealth of the world had increased at a rate before undreamed of. To be\r\nsure this vast increase had gone chiefly to make the rich richer,\r\nincreasing the gap between them and the poor; but the fact remained\r\nthat, as a means merely of producing wealth, capital had been proved\r\nefficient in proportion to its consolidation. The restoration of the\r\nold system with the subdivision of capital, if it were possible, might\r\nindeed bring back a greater equality of conditions, with more\r\nindividual dignity and freedom, but it would be at the price of\r\ngeneral poverty and the arrest of material progress.\r\n\r\n"Was there, then, no way of commanding the services of the mighty\r\nwealth-producing principle of consolidated capital without bowing down\r\nto a plutocracy like that of Carthage? As soon as men began to ask\r\nthemselves these questions, they found the answer ready for them. The\r\nmovement toward the conduct of business by larger and larger\r\naggregations of capital, the tendency toward monopolies, which had\r\nbeen so desperately and vainly resisted, was recognized at last, in\r\nits true significance, as a process which only needed to complete its\r\nlogical evolution to open a golden future to humanity.\r\n\r\n"Early in the last century the evolution was completed by the final\r\nconsolidation of the entire capital of the nation. The industry and\r\ncommerce of the country, ceasing to be conducted by a set of\r\nirresponsible corporations and syndicates of private persons at their\r\ncaprice and for their profit, were intrusted to a single syndicate\r\nrepresenting the people, to be conducted in the common interest for\r\nthe common profit. The nation, that is to say, organized as the one\r\ngreat business corporation in which all other corporations were\r\nabsorbed; it became the one capitalist in the place of all other\r\ncapitalists, the sole employer, the final monopoly in which all\r\nprevious and lesser monopolies were swallowed up, a monopoly in the\r\nprofits and economies of which all citizens shared. The epoch of\r\ntrusts had ended in The Great Trust. In a word, the people of the\r\nUnited States concluded to assume the conduct of their own business,\r\njust as one hundred odd years before they had assumed the conduct of\r\ntheir own government, organizing now for industrial purposes on\r\nprecisely the same grounds that they had then organized for political\r\npurposes. At last, strangely late in the world\'s history, the obvious\r\nfact was perceived that no business is so essentially the public\r\nbusiness as the industry and commerce on which the people\'s livelihood\r\ndepends, and that to entrust it to private persons to be managed for\r\nprivate profit is a folly similar in kind, though vastly greater in\r\nmagnitude, to that of surrendering the functions of political\r\ngovernment to kings and nobles to be conducted for their personal\r\nglorification."\r\n\r\n"Such a stupendous change as you describe," said I, "did not, of\r\ncourse, take place without great bloodshed and terrible convulsions."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary," replied Dr. Leete, "there was absolutely no\r\nviolence. The change had been long foreseen. Public opinion had become\r\nfully ripe for it, and the whole mass of the people was behind it.\r\nThere was no more possibility of opposing it by force than by\r\nargument. On the other hand the popular sentiment toward the great\r\ncorporations and those identified with them had ceased to be one of\r\nbitterness, as they came to realize their necessity as a link, a\r\ntransition phase, in the evolution of the true industrial system. The\r\nmost violent foes of the great private monopolies were now forced to\r\nrecognize how invaluable and indispensable had been their office in\r\neducating the people up to the point of assuming control of their own\r\nbusiness. Fifty years before, the consolidation of the industries of\r\nthe country under national control would have seemed a very daring\r\nexperiment to the most sanguine. But by a series of object lessons,\r\nseen and studied by all men, the great corporations had taught the\r\npeople an entirely new set of ideas on this subject. They had seen for\r\nmany years syndicates handling revenues greater than those of states,\r\nand directing the labors of hundreds of thousands of men with an\r\nefficiency and economy unattainable in smaller operations. It had come\r\nto be recognized as an axiom that the larger the business the simpler\r\nthe principles that can be applied to it; that, as the machine is\r\ntruer than the hand, so the system, which in a great concern does the\r\nwork of the master\'s eye in a small business, turns out more accurate\r\nresults. Thus it came about that, thanks to the corporations\r\nthemselves, when it was proposed that the nation should assume their\r\nfunctions, the suggestion implied nothing which seemed impracticable\r\neven to the timid. To be sure it was a step beyond any yet taken, a\r\nbroader generalization, but the very fact that the nation would be the\r\nsole corporation in the field would, it was seen, relieve the\r\nundertaking of many difficulties with which the partial monopolies had\r\ncontended."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Leete ceased speaking, and I remained silent, endeavoring to form\r\nsome general conception of the changes in the arrangements of society\r\nimplied in the tremendous revolution which he had described.\r\n\r\nFinally I said, "The idea of such an extension of the functions of\r\ngovernment is, to say the least, rather overwhelming."\r\n\r\n"Extension!" he repeated, "where is the extension?"\r\n\r\n"In my day," I replied, "it was considered that the proper functions\r\nof government, strictly speaking, were limited to keeping the peace\r\nand defending the people against the public enemy, that is, to the\r\nmilitary and police powers."\r\n\r\n"And, in heaven\'s name, who are the public enemies?" exclaimed Dr.\r\nLeete. "Are they France, England, Germany, or hunger, cold, and\r\nnakedness? In your day governments were accustomed, on the slightest\r\ninternational misunderstanding, to seize upon the bodies of citizens\r\nand deliver them over by hundreds of thousands to death and\r\nmutilation, wasting their treasures the while like water; and all this\r\noftenest for no imaginable profit to the victims. We have no wars\r\nnow, and our governments no war powers, but in order to protect every\r\ncitizen against hunger, cold, and nakedness, and provide for all his\r\nphysical and mental needs, the function is assumed of directing his\r\nindustry for a term of years. No, Mr. West, I am sure on reflection\r\nyou will perceive that it was in your age, not in ours, that the\r\nextension of the functions of governments was extraordinary. Not even\r\nfor the best ends would men now allow their governments such powers as\r\nwere then used for the most maleficent."\r\n\r\n"Leaving comparisons aside," I said, "the demagoguery and corruption\r\nof our public men would have been considered, in my day, insuperable\r\nobjections to any assumption by government of the charge of the\r\nnational industries. We should have thought that no arrangement could\r\nbe worse than to entrust the politicians with control of the\r\nwealth-producing machinery of the country. Its material interests were\r\nquite too much the football of parties as it was."\r\n\r\n"No doubt you were right," rejoined Dr. Leete, "but all that is\r\nchanged now. We have no parties or politicians, and as for demagoguery\r\nand corruption, they are words having only an historical\r\nsignificance."\r\n\r\n"Human nature itself must have changed very much," I said.\r\n\r\n"Not at all," was Dr. Leete\'s reply, "but the conditions of human\r\nlife have changed, and with them the motives of human action. The\r\norganization of society with you was such that officials were under a\r\nconstant temptation to misuse their power for the private profit of\r\nthemselves or others. Under such circumstances it seems almost strange\r\nthat you dared entrust them with any of your affairs. Nowadays, on the\r\ncontrary, society is so constituted that there is absolutely no way in\r\nwhich an official, however ill-disposed, could possibly make any\r\nprofit for himself or any one else by a misuse of his power. Let him\r\nbe as bad an official as you please, he cannot be a corrupt one. There\r\nis no motive to be. The social system no longer offers a premium on\r\ndishonesty. But these are matters which you can only understand as you\r\ncome, with time, to know us better."\r\n\r\n"But you have not yet told me how you have settled the labor problem.\r\nIt is the problem of capital which we have been discussing," I said.\r\n"After the nation had assumed conduct of the mills, machinery,\r\nrailroads, farms, mines, and capital in general of the country, the\r\nlabor question still remained. In assuming the responsibilities of\r\ncapital the nation had assumed the difficulties of the capitalist\'s\r\nposition."\r\n\r\n"The moment the nation assumed the responsibilities of capital those\r\ndifficulties vanished," replied Dr. Leete. "The national organization\r\nof labor under one direction was the complete solution of what was,\r\nin your day and under your system, justly regarded as the insoluble\r\nlabor problem. When the nation became the sole employer, all the\r\ncitizens, by virtue of their citizenship, became employees, to be\r\ndistributed according to the needs of industry."\r\n\r\n"That is," I suggested, "you have simply applied the principle of\r\nuniversal military service, as it was understood in our day, to the\r\nlabor question."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Dr. Leete, "that was something which followed as a matter\r\nof course as soon as the nation had become the sole capitalist. The\r\npeople were already accustomed to the idea that the obligation of\r\nevery citizen, not physically disabled, to contribute his military\r\nservices to the defense of the nation was equal and absolute. That it\r\nwas equally the duty of every citizen to contribute his quota of\r\nindustrial or intellectual services to the maintenance of the nation\r\nwas equally evident, though it was not until the nation became the\r\nemployer of labor that citizens were able to render this sort of\r\nservice with any pretense either of universality or equity. No\r\norganization of labor was possible when the employing power was\r\ndivided among hundreds or thousands of individuals and corporations,\r\nbetween which concert of any kind was neither desired, nor indeed\r\nfeasible. It constantly happened then that vast numbers who desired to\r\nlabor could find no opportunity, and on the other hand, those who\r\ndesired to evade a part or all of their debt could easily do so."\r\n\r\n"Service, now, I suppose, is compulsory upon all," I suggested.\r\n\r\n"It is rather a matter of course than of compulsion," replied Dr.\r\nLeete. "It is regarded as so absolutely natural and reasonable that\r\nthe idea of its being compulsory has ceased to be thought of. He would\r\nbe thought to be an incredibly contemptible person who should need\r\ncompulsion in such a case. Nevertheless, to speak of service being\r\ncompulsory would be a weak way to state its absolute inevitableness.\r\nOur entire social order is so wholly based upon and deduced from it\r\nthat if it were conceivable that a man could escape it, he would be\r\nleft with no possible way to provide for his existence. He would have\r\nexcluded himself from the world, cut himself off from his kind, in a\r\nword, committed suicide."\r\n\r\n"Is the term of service in this industrial army for life?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; it both begins later and ends earlier than the average\r\nworking period in your day. Your workshops were filled with children\r\nand old men, but we hold the period of youth sacred to education, and\r\nthe period of maturity, when the physical forces begin to flag,\r\nequally sacred to ease and agreeable relaxation. The period of\r\nindustrial service is twenty-four years, beginning at the close of\r\nthe course of education at twenty-one and terminating at forty-five.\r\nAfter forty-five, while discharged from labor, the citizen still\r\nremains liable to special calls, in case of emergencies causing a\r\nsudden great increase in the demand for labor, till he reaches the age\r\nof fifty-five, but such calls are rarely, in fact almost never, made.\r\nThe fifteenth day of October of every year is what we call Muster Day,\r\nbecause those who have reached the age of twenty-one are then mustered\r\ninto the industrial service, and at the same time those who, after\r\ntwenty-four years\' service, have reached the age of forty-five, are\r\nhonorably mustered out. It is the great day of the year with us,\r\nwhence we reckon all other events, our Olympiad, save that it is\r\nannual."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n"It is after you have mustered your industrial army into service," I\r\nsaid, "that I should expect the chief difficulty to arise, for there\r\nits analogy with a military army must cease. Soldiers have all the\r\nsame thing, and a very simple thing, to do, namely, to practice the\r\nmanual of arms, to march and stand guard. But the industrial army must\r\nlearn and follow two or three hundred diverse trades and avocations.\r\nWhat administrative talent can be equal to determining wisely what\r\ntrade or business every individual in a great nation shall pursue?"\r\n\r\n"The administration has nothing to do with determining that point."\r\n\r\n"Who does determine it, then?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Every man for himself in accordance with his natural aptitude, the\r\nutmost pains being taken to enable him to find out what his natural\r\naptitude really is. The principle on which our industrial army is\r\norganized is that a man\'s natural endowments, mental and physical,\r\ndetermine what he can work at most profitably to the nation and most\r\nsatisfactorily to himself. While the obligation of service in some\r\nform is not to be evaded, voluntary election, subject only to\r\nnecessary regulation, is depended on to determine the particular sort\r\nof service every man is to render. As an individual\'s satisfaction\r\nduring his term of service depends on his having an occupation to his\r\ntaste, parents and teachers watch from early years for indications of\r\nspecial aptitudes in children. A thorough study of the National\r\nindustrial system, with the history and rudiments of all the great\r\ntrades, is an essential part of our educational system. While manual\r\ntraining is not allowed to encroach on the general intellectual\r\nculture to which our schools are devoted, it is carried far enough to\r\ngive our youth, in addition to their theoretical knowledge of the\r\nnational industries, mechanical and agricultural, a certain\r\nfamiliarity with their tools and methods. Our schools are constantly\r\nvisiting our workshops, and often are taken on long excursions to\r\ninspect particular industrial enterprises. In your day a man was not\r\nashamed to be grossly ignorant of all trades except his own, but such\r\nignorance would not be consistent with our idea of placing every one\r\nin a position to select intelligently the occupation for which he has\r\nmost taste. Usually long before he is mustered into service a young\r\nman has found out the pursuit he wants to follow, has acquired a great\r\ndeal of knowledge about it, and is waiting impatiently the time when\r\nhe can enlist in its ranks."\r\n\r\n"Surely," I said, "it can hardly be that the number of volunteers for\r\nany trade is exactly the number needed in that trade. It must be\r\ngenerally either under or over the demand."\r\n\r\n"The supply of volunteers is always expected to fully equal the\r\ndemand," replied Dr. Leete. "It is the business of the administration\r\nto see that this is the case. The rate of volunteering for each trade\r\nis closely watched. If there be a noticeably greater excess of\r\nvolunteers over men needed in any trade, it is inferred that the trade\r\noffers greater attractions than others. On the other hand, if the\r\nnumber of volunteers for a trade tends to drop below the demand, it is\r\ninferred that it is thought more arduous. It is the business of the\r\nadministration to seek constantly to equalize the attractions of the\r\ntrades, so far as the conditions of labor in them are concerned, so\r\nthat all trades shall be equally attractive to persons having natural\r\ntastes for them. This is done by making the hours of labor in\r\ndifferent trades to differ according to their arduousness. The lighter\r\ntrades, prosecuted under the most agreeable circumstances, have in\r\nthis way the longest hours, while an arduous trade, such as mining,\r\nhas very short hours. There is no theory, no _a priori_ rule, by which\r\nthe respective attractiveness of industries is determined. The\r\nadministration, in taking burdens off one class of workers and adding\r\nthem to other classes, simply follows the fluctuations of opinion\r\namong the workers themselves as indicated by the rate of\r\nvolunteering. The principle is that no man\'s work ought to be, on the\r\nwhole, harder for him than any other man\'s for him, the workers\r\nthemselves to be the judges. There are no limits to the application of\r\nthis rule. If any particular occupation is in itself so arduous or so\r\noppressive that, in order to induce volunteers, the day\'s work in it\r\nhad to be reduced to ten minutes, it would be done. If, even then, no\r\nman was willing to do it, it would remain undone. But of course, in\r\npoint of fact, a moderate reduction in the hours of labor, or addition\r\nof other privileges, suffices to secure all needed volunteers for any\r\noccupation necessary to men. If, indeed, the unavoidable difficulties\r\nand dangers of such a necessary pursuit were so great that no\r\ninducement of compensating advantages would overcome men\'s repugnance\r\nto it, the administration would only need to take it out of the common\r\norder of occupations by declaring it \'extra hazardous,\' and those who\r\npursued it especially worthy of the national gratitude, to be overrun\r\nwith volunteers. Our young men are very greedy of honor, and do not\r\nlet slip such opportunities. Of course you will see that dependence on\r\nthe purely voluntary choice of avocations involves the abolition in\r\nall of anything like unhygienic conditions or special peril to life\r\nand limb. Health and safety are conditions common to all industries.\r\nThe nation does not maim and slaughter its workmen by thousands, as\r\ndid the private capitalists and corporations of your day."\r\n\r\n"When there are more who want to enter a particular trade than there\r\nis room for, how do you decide between the applicants?" I inquired.\r\n\r\n"Preference is given to those who have acquired the most knowledge of\r\nthe trade they wish to follow. No man, however, who through successive\r\nyears remains persistent in his desire to show what he can do at any\r\nparticular trade, is in the end denied an opportunity. Meanwhile, if a\r\nman cannot at first win entrance into the business he prefers, he has\r\nusually one or more alternative preferences, pursuits for which he has\r\nsome degree of aptitude, although not the highest. Every one, indeed,\r\nis expected to study his aptitudes so as to have not only a first\r\nchoice as to occupation, but a second or third, so that if, either at\r\nthe outset of his career or subsequently, owing to the progress of\r\ninvention or changes in demand, he is unable to follow his first\r\nvocation, he can still find reasonably congenial employment. This\r\nprinciple of secondary choices as to occupation is quite important in\r\nour system. I should add, in reference to the counter-possibility of\r\nsome sudden failure of volunteers in a particular trade, or some\r\nsudden necessity of an increased force, that the administration, while\r\ndepending on the voluntary system for filling up the trades as a rule,\r\nholds always in reserve the power to call for special volunteers, or\r\ndraft any force needed from any quarter. Generally, however, all needs\r\nof this sort can be met by details from the class of unskilled or\r\ncommon laborers."\r\n\r\n"How is this class of common laborers recruited?" I asked. "Surely\r\nnobody voluntarily enters that."\r\n\r\n"It is the grade to which all new recruits belong for the first three\r\nyears of their service. It is not till after this period, during which\r\nhe is assignable to any work at the discretion of his superiors, that\r\nthe young man is allowed to elect a special avocation. These three\r\nyears of stringent discipline none are exempt from, and very glad our\r\nyoung men are to pass from this severe school into the comparative\r\nliberty of the trades. If a man were so stupid as to have no choice as\r\nto occupation, he would simply remain a common laborer; but such\r\ncases, as you may suppose, are not common."\r\n\r\n"Having once elected and entered on a trade or occupation," I\r\nremarked, "I suppose he has to stick to it the rest of his life."\r\n\r\n"Not necessarily," replied Dr. Leete; "while frequent and merely\r\ncapricious changes of occupation are not encouraged or even permitted,\r\nevery worker is allowed, of course, under certain regulations and in\r\naccordance with the exigencies of the service, to volunteer for\r\nanother industry which he thinks would suit him better than his first\r\nchoice. In this case his application is received just as if he were\r\nvolunteering for the first time, and on the same terms. Not only\r\nthis, but a worker may likewise, under suitable regulations and not\r\ntoo frequently, obtain a transfer to an establishment of the same\r\nindustry in another part of the country which for any reason he may\r\nprefer. Under your system a discontented man could indeed leave his\r\nwork at will, but he left his means of support at the same time, and\r\ntook his chances as to future livelihood. We find that the number of\r\nmen who wish to abandon an accustomed occupation for a new one, and\r\nold friends and associations for strange ones, is small. It is only\r\nthe poorer sort of workmen who desire to change even as frequently as\r\nour regulations permit. Of course transfers or discharges, when health\r\ndemands them, are always given."\r\n\r\n"As an industrial system, I should think this might be extremely\r\nefficient," I said, "but I don\'t see that it makes any provision for\r\nthe professional classes, the men who serve the nation with brains\r\ninstead of hands. Of course you can\'t get along without the\r\nbrain-workers. How, then, are they selected from those who are to\r\nserve as farmers and mechanics? That must require a very delicate sort\r\nof sifting process, I should say."\r\n\r\n"So it does," replied Dr. Leete; "the most delicate possible test is\r\nneeded here, and so we leave the question whether a man shall be a\r\nbrain or hand worker entirely to him to settle. At the end of the term\r\nof three years as a common laborer, which every man must serve, it is\r\nfor him to choose, in accordance to his natural tastes, whether he\r\nwill fit himself for an art or profession, or be a farmer or mechanic.\r\nIf he feels that he can do better work with his brains than his\r\nmuscles, he finds every facility provided for testing the reality of\r\nhis supposed bent, of cultivating it, and if fit of pursuing it as his\r\navocation. The schools of technology, of medicine, of art, of music,\r\nof histrionics, and of higher liberal learning are always open to\r\naspirants without condition."\r\n\r\n"Are not the schools flooded with young men whose only motive is to\r\navoid work?"\r\n\r\nDr. Leete smiled a little grimly.\r\n\r\n"No one is at all likely to enter the professional schools for the\r\npurpose of avoiding work, I assure you," he said. "They are intended\r\nfor those with special aptitude for the branches they teach, and any\r\none without it would find it easier to do double hours at his trade\r\nthan try to keep up with the classes. Of course many honestly mistake\r\ntheir vocation, and, finding themselves unequal to the requirements of\r\nthe schools, drop out and return to the industrial service; no\r\ndiscredit attaches to such persons, for the public policy is to\r\nencourage all to develop suspected talents which only actual tests can\r\nprove the reality of. The professional and scientific schools of your\r\nday depended on the patronage of their pupils for support, and the\r\npractice appears to have been common of giving diplomas to unfit\r\npersons, who afterwards found their way into the professions. Our\r\nschools are national institutions, and to have passed their tests is a\r\nproof of special abilities not to be questioned.\r\n\r\n"This opportunity for a professional training," the doctor continued,\r\n"remains open to every man till the age of thirty is reached, after\r\nwhich students are not received, as there would remain too brief a\r\nperiod before the age of discharge in which to serve the nation in\r\ntheir professions. In your day young men had to choose their\r\nprofessions very young, and therefore, in a large proportion of\r\ninstances, wholly mistook their vocations. It is recognized nowadays\r\nthat the natural aptitudes of some are later than those of others in\r\ndeveloping, and therefore, while the choice of profession may be made\r\nas early as twenty-four, it remains open for six years longer."\r\n\r\nA question which had a dozen times before been on my lips now found\r\nutterance, a question which touched upon what, in my time, had been\r\nregarded the most vital difficulty in the way of any final settlement\r\nof the industrial problem. "It is an extraordinary thing," I said,\r\n"that you should not yet have said a word about the method of\r\nadjusting wages. Since the nation is the sole employer, the government\r\nmust fix the rate of wages and determine just how much everybody shall\r\nearn, from the doctors to the diggers. All I can say is, that this\r\nplan would never have worked with us, and I don\'t see how it can now\r\nunless human nature has changed. In my day, nobody was satisfied with\r\nhis wages or salary. Even if he felt he received enough, he was sure\r\nhis neighbor had too much, which was as bad. If the universal\r\ndiscontent on this subject, instead of being dissipated in curses and\r\nstrikes directed against innumerable employers, could have been\r\nconcentrated upon one, and that the government, the strongest ever\r\ndevised would not have seen two pay days."\r\n\r\nDr. Leete laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n"Very true, very true," he said, "a general strike would most probably\r\nhave followed the first pay day, and a strike directed against a\r\ngovernment is a revolution."\r\n\r\n"How, then, do you avoid a revolution every pay day?" I demanded. "Has\r\nsome prodigious philosopher devised a new system of calculus\r\nsatisfactory to all for determining the exact and comparative value of\r\nall sorts of service, whether by brawn or brain, by hand or voice, by\r\near or eye? Or has human nature itself changed, so that no man looks\r\nupon his own things but \'every man on the things of his neighbor?\' One\r\nor the other of these events must be the explanation."\r\n\r\n"Neither one nor the other, however, is," was my host\'s laughing\r\nresponse. "And now, Mr. West," he continued, "you must remember that\r\nyou are my patient as well as my guest, and permit me to prescribe\r\nsleep for you before we have any more conversation. It is after three\r\no\'clock."\r\n\r\n"The prescription is, no doubt, a wise one," I said; "I only hope it\r\ncan be filled."\r\n\r\n"I will see to that," the doctor replied, and he did, for he gave me a\r\nwineglass of something or other which sent me to sleep as soon as my\r\nhead touched the pillow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke I felt greatly refreshed, and lay a considerable time in\r\na dozing state, enjoying the sensation of bodily comfort. The\r\nexperiences of the day previous, my waking to find myself in the year\r\n2000, the sight of the new Boston, my host and his family, and the\r\nwonderful things I had heard, were a blank in my memory. I thought I\r\nwas in my bed-chamber at home, and the half-dreaming, half-waking\r\nfancies which passed before my mind related to the incidents and\r\nexperiences of my former life. Dreamily I reviewed the incidents of\r\nDecoration Day, my trip in company with Edith and her parents to Mount\r\nAuburn, and my dining with them on our return to the city. I recalled\r\nhow extremely well Edith had looked, and from that fell to thinking of\r\nour marriage; but scarcely had my imagination begun to develop this\r\ndelightful theme than my waking dream was cut short by the\r\nrecollection of the letter I had received the night before from the\r\nbuilder announcing that the new strikes might postpone indefinitely\r\nthe completion of the new house. The chagrin which this recollection\r\nbrought with it effectually roused me. I remembered that I had an\r\nappointment with the builder at eleven o\'clock, to discuss the strike,\r\nand opening my eyes, looked up at the clock at the foot of my bed to\r\nsee what time it was. But no clock met my glance, and what was more, I\r\ninstantly perceived that I was not in my room. Starting up on my\r\ncouch, I stared wildly round the strange apartment.\r\n\r\nI think it must have been many seconds that I sat up thus in bed\r\nstaring about, without being able to regain the clew to my personal\r\nidentity. I was no more able to distinguish myself from pure being\r\nduring those moments than we may suppose a soul in the rough to be\r\nbefore it has received the ear-marks, the individualizing touches\r\nwhich make it a person. Strange that the sense of this inability\r\nshould be such anguish! but so we are constituted. There are no words\r\nfor the mental torture I endured during this helpless, eyeless groping\r\nfor myself in a boundless void. No other experience of the mind gives\r\nprobably anything like the sense of absolute intellectual arrest from\r\nthe loss of a mental fulcrum, a starting point of thought, which comes\r\nduring such a momentary obscuration of the sense of one\'s identity. I\r\ntrust I may never know what it is again.\r\n\r\nI do not know how long this condition had lasted,--it seemed an\r\ninterminable time,--when, like a flash, the recollection of everything\r\ncame back to me. I remembered who and where I was, and how I had come\r\nhere, and that these scenes as of the life of yesterday which had\r\nbeen passing before my mind concerned a generation long, long ago\r\nmouldered to dust. Leaping from bed, I stood in the middle of the room\r\nclasping my temples with all my might between my hands to keep them\r\nfrom bursting. Then I fell prone on the couch, and, burying my face in\r\nthe pillow, lay with out motion. The reaction which was inevitable,\r\nfrom the mental elation, the fever of the intellect that had been the\r\nfirst effect of my tremendous experience, had arrived. The emotional\r\ncrisis which had awaited the full realization of my actual position,\r\nand all that it implied, was upon me, and with set teeth and laboring\r\nchest, gripping the bedstead with frenzied strength, I lay there and\r\nfought for my sanity. In my mind, all had broken loose, habits of\r\nfeeling, associations of thought, ideas of persons and things, all had\r\ndissolved and lost coherence and were seething together in apparently\r\nirretrievable chaos. There were no rallying points, nothing was left\r\nstable. There only remained the will, and was any human will strong\r\nenough to say to such a weltering sea "Peace, be still"? I dared not\r\nthink. Every effort to reason upon what had befallen me, and realize\r\nwhat it implied, set up an intolerable swimming of the brain. The idea\r\nthat I was two persons, that my identity was double, began to\r\nfascinate me with its simple solution of my experience.\r\n\r\nI knew that I was on the verge of losing my mental balance. If I lay\r\nthere thinking, I was doomed. Diversion of some sort I must have, at\r\nleast the diversion of physical exertion. I sprang up, and, hastily\r\ndressing, opened the door of my room and went down-stairs. The hour\r\nwas very early, it being not yet fairly light, and I found no one in\r\nthe lower part of the house. There was a hat in the hall, and, opening\r\nthe front door, which was fastened with a slightness indicating that\r\nburglary was not among the perils of the modern Boston, I found myself\r\non the street. For two hours I walked or ran through the streets of\r\nthe city, visiting most quarters of the peninsular part of the town.\r\nNone but an antiquarian who knows something of the contrast which the\r\nBoston of to-day offers to the Boston of the nineteenth century can\r\nbegin to appreciate what a series of bewildering surprises I underwent\r\nduring that time. Viewed from the house-top the day before, the city\r\nhad indeed appeared strange to me, but that was only in its general\r\naspect. How complete the change had been I first realized now that I\r\nwalked the streets. The few old landmarks which still remained only\r\nintensified this effect, for without them I might have imagined myself\r\nin a foreign town. A man may leave his native city in childhood, and\r\nreturn fifty years later, perhaps, to find it transformed in many\r\nfeatures. He is astonished, but he is not bewildered. He is aware of a\r\ngreat lapse of time, and of changes likewise occurring in himself\r\nmeanwhile. He but dimly recalls the city as he knew it when a child.\r\nBut remember that there was no sense of any lapse of time with me. So\r\nfar as my consciousness was concerned, it was but yesterday, but a few\r\nhours, since I had walked these streets in which scarcely a feature\r\nhad escaped a complete metamorphosis. The mental image of the old city\r\nwas so fresh and strong that it did not yield to the impression of the\r\nactual city, but contended with it, so that it was first one and then\r\nthe other which seemed the more unreal. There was nothing I saw which\r\nwas not blurred in this way, like the faces of a composite photograph.\r\n\r\nFinally, I stood again at the door of the house from which I had come\r\nout. My feet must have instinctively brought me back to the site of my\r\nold home, for I had no clear idea of returning thither. It was no more\r\nhomelike to me than any other spot in this city of a strange\r\ngeneration, nor were its inmates less utterly and necessarily\r\nstrangers than all the other men and women now on the earth. Had the\r\ndoor of the house been locked, I should have been reminded by its\r\nresistance that I had no object in entering, and turned away, but it\r\nyielded to my hand, and advancing with uncertain steps through the\r\nhall, I entered one of the apartments opening from it. Throwing myself\r\ninto a chair, I covered my burning eyeballs with my hands to shut out\r\nthe horror of strangeness. My mental confusion was so intense as to\r\nproduce actual nausea. The anguish of those moments, during which my\r\nbrain seemed melting, or the abjectness of my sense of helplessness,\r\nhow can I describe? In my despair I groaned aloud. I began to feel\r\nthat unless some help should come I was about to lose my mind. And\r\njust then it did come. I heard the rustle of drapery, and looked up.\r\nEdith Leete was standing before me. Her beautiful face was full of the\r\nmost poignant sympathy.\r\n\r\n"Oh, what is the matter, Mr. West?" she said. "I was here when you\r\ncame in. I saw how dreadfully distressed you looked, and when I heard\r\nyou groan, I could not keep silent. What has happened to you? Where\r\nhave you been? Can\'t I do something for you?"\r\n\r\nPerhaps she involuntarily held out her hands in a gesture of\r\ncompassion as she spoke. At any rate I had caught them in my own and\r\nwas clinging to them with an impulse as instinctive as that which\r\nprompts the drowning man to seize upon and cling to the rope which is\r\nthrown him as he sinks for the last time. As I looked up into her\r\ncompassionate face and her eyes moist with pity, my brain ceased to\r\nwhirl. The tender human sympathy which thrilled in the soft pressure\r\nof her fingers had brought me the support I needed. Its effect to calm\r\nand soothe was like that of some wonder-working elixir.\r\n\r\n"God bless you," I said, after a few moments. "He must have sent you\r\nto me just now. I think I was in danger of going crazy if you had not\r\ncome." At this the tears came into her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. West!" she cried. "How heartless you must have thought us!\r\nHow could we leave you to yourself so long! But it is over now, is it\r\nnot? You are better, surely."\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said, "thanks to you. If you will not go away quite yet, I\r\nshall be myself soon."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I will not go away," she said, with a little quiver of her\r\nface, more expressive of her sympathy than a volume of words. "You\r\nmust not think us so heartless as we seemed in leaving you so by\r\nyourself. I scarcely slept last night, for thinking how strange your\r\nwaking would be this morning; but father said you would sleep till\r\nlate. He said that it would be better not to show too much sympathy\r\nwith you at first, but to try to divert your thoughts and make you\r\nfeel that you were among friends."\r\n\r\n"You have indeed made me feel that," I answered. "But you see it is a\r\ngood deal of a jolt to drop a hundred years, and although I did not\r\nseem to feel it so much last night, I have had very odd sensations\r\nthis morning." While I held her hands and kept my eyes on her face, I\r\ncould already even jest a little at my plight.\r\n\r\n"No one thought of such a thing as your going out in the city alone so\r\nearly in the morning," she went on. "Oh, Mr. West, where have you\r\nbeen?"\r\n\r\nThen I told her of my morning\'s experience, from my first waking till\r\nthe moment I had looked up to see her before me, just as I have told\r\nit here. She was overcome by distressful pity during the recital, and,\r\nthough I had released one of her hands, did not try to take from me\r\nthe other, seeing, no doubt, how much good it did me to hold it. "I\r\ncan think a little what this feeling must been like," she said. "It\r\nmust have been terrible. And to think you were left alone to struggle\r\nwith it! Can you ever forgive us?"\r\n\r\n"But it is gone now. You have driven it quite away for the present," I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"You will not let it return again," she queried anxiously.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t quite say that," I replied. "It might be too early to say\r\nthat, considering how strange everything will still be to me."\r\n\r\n"But you will not try to contend with it alone again, at least," she\r\npersisted. "Promise that you will come to us, and let us sympathize\r\nwith you, and try to help you. Perhaps we can\'t do much, but it will\r\nsurely be better than to try to bear such feelings alone."\r\n\r\n"I will come to you if you will let me," I said.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, yes, I beg you will," she said eagerly. "I would do anything\r\nto help you that I could."\r\n\r\n"All you need do is to be sorry for me, as you seem to be now," I\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n"It is understood, then," she said, smiling with wet eyes, "that you\r\nare to come and tell me next time, and not run all over Boston among\r\nstrangers."\r\n\r\nThis assumption that we were not strangers seemed scarcely strange, so\r\nnear within these few minutes had my trouble and her sympathetic tears\r\nbrought us.\r\n\r\n"I will promise, when you come to me," she added, with an expression\r\nof charming archness, passing, as she continued, into one of\r\nenthusiasm, "to seem as sorry for you as you wish, but you must not\r\nfor a moment suppose that I am really sorry for you at all, or that I\r\nthink you will long be sorry for yourself. I know, as well as I know\r\nthat the world now is heaven compared with what it was in your day,\r\nthat the only feeling you will have after a little while will be one\r\nof thankfulness to God that your life in that age was so strangely cut\r\noff, to be returned to you in this."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. and Mrs. Leete were evidently not a little startled to learn, when\r\nthey presently appeared, that I had been all over the city alone that\r\nmorning, and it was apparent that they were agreeably surprised to see\r\nthat I seemed so little agitated after the experience.\r\n\r\n"Your stroll could scarcely have failed to be a very interesting one,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Leete, as we sat down to table soon after. "You must have\r\nseen a good many new things."\r\n\r\n"I saw very little that was not new," I replied. "But I think what\r\nsurprised me as much as anything was not to find any stores on\r\nWashington Street, or any banks on State. What have you done with the\r\nmerchants and bankers? Hung them all, perhaps, as the anarchists\r\nwanted to do in my day?"\r\n\r\n"Not so bad as that," replied Dr. Leete. "We have simply dispensed\r\nwith them. Their functions are obsolete in the modern world."\r\n\r\n"Who sells you things when you want to buy them?" I inquired.\r\n\r\n"There is neither selling nor buying nowadays; the distribution of\r\ngoods is effected in another way. As to the bankers, having no money\r\nwe have no use for those gentry."\r\n\r\n"Miss Leete," said I, turning to Edith, "I am afraid that your father\r\nis making sport of me. I don\'t blame him, for the temptation my\r\ninnocence offers must be extraordinary. But, really, there are limits\r\nto my credulity as to possible alterations in the social system."\r\n\r\n"Father has no idea of jesting, I am sure," she replied, with a\r\nreassuring smile.\r\n\r\nThe conversation took another turn then, the point of ladies\' fashions\r\nin the nineteenth century being raised, if I remember rightly, by Mrs.\r\nLeete, and it was not till after breakfast, when the doctor had\r\ninvited me up to the house-top, which appeared to be a favorite resort\r\nof his, that he recurred to the subject.\r\n\r\n"You were surprised," he said, "at my saying that we got along without\r\nmoney or trade, but a moment\'s reflection will show that trade existed\r\nand money was needed in your day simply because the business of\r\nproduction was left in private hands, and that, consequently, they are\r\nsuperfluous now."\r\n\r\n"I do not at once see how that follows," I replied.\r\n\r\n"It is very simple," said Dr. Leete. "When innumerable different and\r\nindependent persons produced the various things needful to life and\r\ncomfort, endless exchanges between individuals were requisite in\r\norder that they might supply themselves with what they desired. These\r\nexchanges constituted trade, and money was essential as their medium.\r\nBut as soon as the nation became the sole producer of all sorts of\r\ncommodities, there was no need of exchanges between individuals that\r\nthey might get what they required. Everything was procurable from one\r\nsource, and nothing could be procured anywhere else. A system of\r\ndirect distribution from the national storehouses took the place of\r\ntrade, and for this money was unnecessary."\r\n\r\n"How is this distribution managed?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"On the simplest possible plan," replied Dr. Leete. "A credit\r\ncorresponding to his share of the annual product of the nation is\r\ngiven to every citizen on the public books at the beginning of each\r\nyear, and a credit card issued him with which he procures at the\r\npublic storehouses, found in every community, whatever he desires\r\nwhenever he desires it. This arrangement, you will see, totally\r\nobviates the necessity for business transactions of any sort between\r\nindividuals and consumers. Perhaps you would like to see what our\r\ncredit-cards are like.\r\n\r\n"You observe," he pursued as I was curiously examining the piece of\r\npasteboard he gave me, "that this card is issued for a certain number\r\nof dollars. We have kept the old word, but not the substance. The\r\nterm, as we use it, answers to no real thing, but merely serves as an\r\nalgebraical symbol for comparing the values of products with one\r\nanother. For this purpose they are all priced in dollars and cents,\r\njust as in your day. The value of what I procure on this card is\r\nchecked off by the clerk, who pricks out of these tiers of squares the\r\nprice of what I order."\r\n\r\n"If you wanted to buy something of your neighbor, could you transfer\r\npart of your credit to him as consideration?" I inquired.\r\n\r\n"In the first place," replied Dr. Leete, "our neighbors have nothing\r\nto sell us, but in any event our credit would not be transferable,\r\nbeing strictly personal. Before the nation could even think of\r\nhonoring any such transfer as you speak of, it would be bound to\r\ninquire into all the circumstances of the transaction, so as to be\r\nable to guarantee its absolute equity. It would have been reason\r\nenough, had there been no other, for abolishing money, that its\r\npossession was no indication of rightful title to it. In the hands of\r\nthe man who had stolen it or murdered for it, it was as good as in\r\nthose which had earned it by industry. People nowadays interchange\r\ngifts and favors out of friendship, but buying and selling is\r\nconsidered absolutely inconsistent with the mutual benevolence and\r\ndisinterestedness which should prevail between citizens and the sense\r\nof community of interest which supports our social system. According\r\nto our ideas, buying and selling is essentially anti-social in all\r\nits tendencies. It is an education in self-seeking at the expense of\r\nothers, and no society whose citizens are trained in such a school can\r\npossibly rise above a very low grade of civilization."\r\n\r\n"What if you have to spend more than your card in any one year?" I\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"The provision is so ample that we are more likely not to spend it\r\nall," replied Dr. Leete. "But if extraordinary expenses should exhaust\r\nit, we can obtain a limited advance on the next year\'s credit, though\r\nthis practice is not encouraged, and a heavy discount is charged to\r\ncheck it. Of course if a man showed himself a reckless spendthrift he\r\nwould receive his allowance monthly or weekly instead of yearly, or if\r\nnecessary not be permitted to handle it all."\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t spend your allowance, I suppose it accumulates?"\r\n\r\n"That is also permitted to a certain extent when a special outlay is\r\nanticipated. But unless notice to the contrary is given, it is\r\npresumed that the citizen who does not fully expend his credit did not\r\nhave occasion to do so, and the balance is turned into the general\r\nsurplus."\r\n\r\n"Such a system does not encourage saving habits on the part of\r\ncitizens," I said.\r\n\r\n"It is not intended to," was the reply. "The nation is rich, and does\r\nnot wish the people to deprive themselves of any good thing. In your\r\nday, men were bound to lay up goods and money against coming failure\r\nof the means of support and for their children. This necessity made\r\nparsimony a virtue. But now it would have no such laudable object,\r\nand, having lost its utility, it has ceased to be regarded as a\r\nvirtue. No man any more has any care for the morrow, either for\r\nhimself or his children, for the nation guarantees the nurture,\r\neducation, and comfortable maintenance of every citizen from the\r\ncradle to the grave."\r\n\r\n"That is a sweeping guarantee!" I said. "What certainty can there be\r\nthat the value of a man\'s labor will recompense the nation for its\r\noutlay on him? On the whole, society may be able to support all its\r\nmembers, but some must earn less than enough for their support, and\r\nothers more; and that brings us back once more to the wages question,\r\non which you have hitherto said nothing. It was at just this point, if\r\nyou remember, that our talk ended last evening; and I say again, as I\r\ndid then, that here I should suppose a national industrial system like\r\nyours would find its main difficulty. How, I ask once more, can you\r\nadjust satisfactorily the comparative wages or remuneration of the\r\nmultitude of avocations, so unlike and so incommensurable, which are\r\nnecessary for the service of society? In our day the market rate\r\ndetermined the price of labor of all sorts, as well as of goods. The\r\nemployer paid as little as he could, and the worker got as much. It\r\nwas not a pretty system ethically, I admit; but it did, at least,\r\nfurnish us a rough and ready formula for settling a question which\r\nmust be settled ten thousand times a day if the world was ever going\r\nto get forward. There seemed to us no other practicable way of doing\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Dr. Leete, "it was the only practicable way under a\r\nsystem which made the interests of every individual antagonistic to\r\nthose of every other; but it would have been a pity if humanity could\r\nnever have devised a better plan, for yours was simply the application\r\nto the mutual relations of men of the devil\'s maxim, \'Your necessity\r\nis my opportunity.\' The reward of any service depended not upon its\r\ndifficulty, danger, or hardship, for throughout the world it seems\r\nthat the most perilous, severe, and repulsive labor was done by the\r\nworst paid classes; but solely upon the strait of those who needed the\r\nservice."\r\n\r\n"All that is conceded," I said. "But, with all its defects, the plan\r\nof settling prices by the market rate was a practical plan; and I\r\ncannot conceive what satisfactory substitute you can have devised for\r\nit. The government being the only possible employer, there is of\r\ncourse no labor market or market rate. Wages of all sorts must be\r\narbitrarily fixed by the government. I cannot imagine a more complex\r\nand delicate function than that must be, or one, however performed,\r\nmore certain to breed universal dissatisfaction."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon," replied Dr. Leete, "but I think you exaggerate\r\nthe difficulty. Suppose a board of fairly sensible men were charged\r\nwith settling the wages for all sorts of trades under a system which,\r\nlike ours, guaranteed employment to all, while permitting the choice\r\nof avocations. Don\'t you see that, however unsatisfactory the first\r\nadjustment might be, the mistakes would soon correct themselves? The\r\nfavored trades would have too many volunteers, and those discriminated\r\nagainst would lack them till the errors were set right. But this is\r\naside from the purpose, for, though this plan would, I fancy, be\r\npracticable enough, it is no part of our system."\r\n\r\n"How, then, do you regulate wages?" I once more asked.\r\n\r\nDr. Leete did not reply till after several moments of meditative\r\nsilence. "I know, of course," he finally said, "enough of the old\r\norder of things to understand just what you mean by that question; and\r\nyet the present order is so utterly different at this point that I am\r\na little at loss how to answer you best. You ask me how we regulate\r\nwages; I can only reply that there is no idea in the modern social\r\neconomy which at all corresponds with what was meant by wages in your\r\nday."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you mean that you have no money to pay wages in," said I.\r\n"But the credit given the worker at the government storehouse answers\r\nto his wages with us. How is the amount of the credit given\r\nrespectively to the workers in different lines determined? By what\r\ntitle does the individual claim his particular share? What is the\r\nbasis of allotment?"\r\n\r\n"His title," replied Dr. Leete, "is his humanity. The basis of his\r\nclaim is the fact that he is a man."\r\n\r\n"The fact that he is a man!" I repeated, incredulously. "Do you\r\npossibly mean that all have the same share?"\r\n\r\n"Most assuredly."\r\n\r\nThe readers of this book never having practically known any other\r\narrangement, or perhaps very carefully considered the historical\r\naccounts of former epochs in which a very different system prevailed,\r\ncannot be expected to appreciate the stupor of amazement into which\r\nDr. Leete\'s simple statement plunged me.\r\n\r\n"You see," he said, smiling, "that it is not merely that we have no\r\nmoney to pay wages in, but, as I said, we have nothing at all\r\nanswering to your idea of wages."\r\n\r\nBy this time I had pulled myself together sufficiently to voice some\r\nof the criticisms which, man of the nineteenth century as I was, came\r\nuppermost in my mind, upon this to me astounding arrangement. "Some\r\nmen do twice the work of others!" I exclaimed. "Are the clever workmen\r\ncontent with a plan that ranks them with the indifferent?"\r\n\r\n"We leave no possible ground for any complaint of injustice," replied\r\nDr. Leete, "by requiring precisely the same measure of service from\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"How can you do that, I should like to know, when no two men\'s powers\r\nare the same?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing could be simpler," was Dr. Leete\'s reply. "We require of each\r\nthat he shall make the same effort; that is, we demand of him the best\r\nservice it is in his power to give."\r\n\r\n"And supposing all do the best they can," I answered, "the amount of\r\nthe product resulting is twice greater from one man than from\r\nanother."\r\n\r\n"Very true," replied Dr. Leete; "but the amount of the resulting\r\nproduct has nothing whatever to do with the question, which is one of\r\ndesert. Desert is a moral question, and the amount of the product a\r\nmaterial quantity. It would be an extraordinary sort of logic which\r\nshould try to determine a moral question by a material standard. The\r\namount of the effort alone is pertinent to the question of desert. All\r\nmen who do their best, do the same. A man\'s endowments, however\r\ngodlike, merely fix the measure of his duty. The man of great\r\nendowments who does not do all he might, though he may do more than a\r\nman of small endowments who does his best, is deemed a less deserving\r\nworker than the latter, and dies a debtor to his fellows. The Creator\r\nsets men\'s tasks for them by the faculties he gives them; we simply\r\nexact their fulfillment."\r\n\r\n"No doubt that is very fine philosophy," I said; "nevertheless it\r\nseems hard that the man who produces twice as much as another, even if\r\nboth do their best, should have only the same share."\r\n\r\n"Does it, indeed, seem so to you?" responded Dr. Leete. "Now, do you\r\nknow, that seems very curious to me? The way it strikes people\r\nnowadays is, that a man who can produce twice as much as another with\r\nthe same effort, instead of being rewarded for doing so, ought to be\r\npunished if he does not do so. In the nineteenth century, when a horse\r\npulled a heavier load than a goat, I suppose you rewarded him. Now, we\r\nshould have whipped him soundly if he had not, on the ground that,\r\nbeing much stronger, he ought to. It is singular how ethical standards\r\nchange." The doctor said this with such a twinkle in his eye that I\r\nwas obliged to laugh.\r\n\r\n"I suppose," I said, "that the real reason that we rewarded men for\r\ntheir endowments, while we considered those of horses and goats merely\r\nas fixing the service to be severally required of them, was that the\r\nanimals, not being reasoning beings, naturally did the best they\r\ncould, whereas men could only be induced to do so by rewarding them\r\naccording to the amount of their product. That brings me to ask why,\r\nunless human nature has mightily changed in a hundred years, you are\r\nnot under the same necessity."\r\n\r\n"We are," replied Dr. Leete. "I don\'t think there has been any change\r\nin human nature in that respect since your day. It is still so\r\nconstituted that special incentives in the form of prizes, and\r\nadvantages to be gained, are requisite to call out the best endeavors\r\nof the average man in any direction."\r\n\r\n"But what inducement," I asked, "can a man have to put forth his best\r\nendeavors when, however much or little he accomplishes, his income\r\nremains the same? High characters may be moved by devotion to the\r\ncommon welfare under such a system, but does not the average man tend\r\nto rest back on his oar, reasoning that it is of no use to make a\r\nspecial effort, since the effort will not increase his income, nor its\r\nwithholding diminish it?"\r\n\r\n"Does it then really seem to you," answered my companion, "that human\r\nnature is insensible to any motives save fear of want and love of\r\nluxury, that you should expect security and equality of livelihood to\r\nleave them without possible incentives to effort? Your contemporaries\r\ndid not really think so, though they might fancy they did. When it was\r\na question of the grandest class of efforts, the most absolute\r\nself-devotion, they depended on quite other incentives. Not higher\r\nwages, but honor and the hope of men\'s gratitude, patriotism and the\r\ninspiration of duty, were the motives which they set before their\r\nsoldiers when it was a question of dying for the nation, and never\r\nwas there an age of the world when those motives did not call out what\r\nis best and noblest in men. And not only this, but when you come to\r\nanalyze the love of money which was the general impulse to effort in\r\nyour day, you find that the dread of want and desire of luxury was but\r\none of several motives which the pursuit of money represented; the\r\nothers, and with many the more influential, being desire of power, of\r\nsocial position, and reputation for ability and success. So you see\r\nthat though we have abolished poverty and the fear of it, and\r\ninordinate luxury with the hope of it, we have not touched the greater\r\npart of the motives which underlay the love of money in former times,\r\nor any of those which prompted the supremer sorts of effort. The\r\ncoarser motives, which no longer move us, have been replaced by higher\r\nmotives wholly unknown to the mere wage earners of your age. Now that\r\nindustry of whatever sort is no longer self-service, but service of\r\nthe nation, patriotism, passion for humanity, impel the worker as in\r\nyour day they did the soldier. The army of industry is an army, not\r\nalone by virtue of its perfect organization, but by reason also of the\r\nardor of self-devotion which animates its members.\r\n\r\n"But as you used to supplement the motives of patriotism with the love\r\nof glory, in order to stimulate the valor of your soldiers, so do we.\r\nBased as our industrial system is on the principle of requiring the\r\nsame unit of effort from every man, that is, the best he can do, you\r\nwill see that the means by which we spur the workers to do their best\r\nmust be a very essential part of our scheme. With us, diligence in the\r\nnational service is the sole and certain way to public repute, social\r\ndistinction, and official power. The value of a man\'s services to\r\nsociety fixes his rank in it. Compared with the effect of our social\r\narrangements in impelling men to be zealous in business, we deem the\r\nobject-lessons of biting poverty and wanton luxury on which you\r\ndepended a device as weak and uncertain as it was barbaric. The lust\r\nof honor even in your sordid day notoriously impelled men to more\r\ndesperate effort than the love of money could."\r\n\r\n"I should be extremely interested," I said, "to learn something of\r\nwhat these social arrangements are."\r\n\r\n"The scheme in its details," replied the doctor, "is of course very\r\nelaborate, for it underlies the entire organization of our industrial\r\narmy; but a few words will give you a general idea of it."\r\n\r\nAt this moment our talk was charmingly interrupted by the emergence\r\nupon the aerial platform where we sat of Edith Leete. She was dressed\r\nfor the street, and had come to speak to her father about some\r\ncommission she was to do for him.\r\n\r\n"By the way, Edith," he exclaimed, as she was about to leave us to\r\nourselves, "I wonder if Mr. West would not be interested in visiting\r\nthe store with you? I have been telling him something about our system\r\nof distribution, and perhaps he might like to see it in practical\r\noperation."\r\n\r\n"My daughter," he added, turning to me, "is an indefatigable shopper,\r\nand can tell you more about the stores than I can."\r\n\r\nThe proposition was naturally very agreeable to me, and Edith being\r\ngood enough to say that she should be glad to have my company, we left\r\nthe house together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\n"If I am going to explain our way of shopping to you," said my\r\ncompanion, as we walked along the street, "you must explain your way\r\nto me. I have never been able to understand it from all I have read on\r\nthe subject. For example, when you had such a vast number of shops,\r\neach with its different assortment, how could a lady ever settle upon\r\nany purchase till she had visited all the shops? for, until she had,\r\nshe could not know what there was to choose from."\r\n\r\n"It was as you suppose; that was the only way she could know," I\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n"Father calls me an indefatigable shopper, but I should soon be a very\r\nfatigued one if I had to do as they did," was Edith\'s laughing\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\n"The loss of time in going from shop to shop was indeed a waste which\r\nthe busy bitterly complained of," I said; "but as for the ladies of\r\nthe idle class, though they complained also, I think the system was\r\nreally a godsend by furnishing a device to kill time."\r\n\r\n"But say there were a thousand shops in a city, hundreds, perhaps, of\r\nthe same sort, how could even the idlest find time to make their\r\nrounds?"\r\n\r\n"They really could not visit all, of course," I replied. "Those who\r\ndid a great deal of buying, learned in time where they might expect to\r\nfind what they wanted. This class had made a science of the\r\nspecialties of the shops, and bought at advantage, always getting the\r\nmost and best for the least money. It required, however, long\r\nexperience to acquire this knowledge. Those who were too busy, or\r\nbought too little to gain it, took their chances and were generally\r\nunfortunate, getting the least and worst for the most money. It was\r\nthe merest chance if persons not experienced in shopping received the\r\nvalue of their money."\r\n\r\n"But why did you put up with such a shockingly inconvenient\r\narrangement when you saw its faults so plainly?" Edith asked me.\r\n\r\n"It was like all our social arrangements," I replied. "You can see\r\ntheir faults scarcely more plainly than we did, but we saw no remedy\r\nfor them."\r\n\r\n"Here we are at the store of our ward," said Edith, as we turned in at\r\nthe great portal of one of the magnificent public buildings I had\r\nobserved in my morning walk. There was nothing in the exterior aspect\r\nof the edifice to suggest a store to a representative of the\r\nnineteenth century. There was no display of goods in the great\r\nwindows, or any device to advertise wares, or attract custom. Nor was\r\nthere any sort of sign or legend on the front of the building to\r\nindicate the character of the business carried on there; but instead,\r\nabove the portal, standing out from the front of the building, a\r\nmajestic life-size group of statuary, the central figure of which was\r\na female ideal of Plenty, with her cornucopia. Judging from the\r\ncomposition of the throng passing in and out, about the same\r\nproportion of the sexes among shoppers obtained as in the nineteenth\r\ncentury. As we entered, Edith said that there was one of these great\r\ndistributing establishments in each ward of the city, so that no\r\nresidence was more than five or ten minutes\' walk from one of them. It\r\nwas the first interior of a twentieth-century public building that I\r\nhad ever beheld, and the spectacle naturally impressed me deeply. I\r\nwas in a vast hall full of light, received not alone from the windows\r\non all sides, but from the dome, the point of which was a hundred feet\r\nabove. Beneath it, in the centre of the hall, a magnificent fountain\r\nplayed, cooling the atmosphere to a delicious freshness with its\r\nspray. The walls and ceiling were frescoed in mellow tints, calculated\r\nto soften without absorbing the light which flooded the interior.\r\nAround the fountain was a space occupied with chairs and sofas, on\r\nwhich many persons were seated conversing. Legends on the walls all\r\nabout the hall indicated to what classes of commodities the counters\r\nbelow were devoted. Edith directed her steps towards one of these,\r\nwhere samples of muslin of a bewildering variety were displayed, and\r\nproceeded to inspect them.\r\n\r\n"Where is the clerk?" I asked, for there was no one behind the\r\ncounter, and no one seemed coming to attend to the customer.\r\n\r\n"I have no need of the clerk yet," said Edith; "I have not made my\r\nselection."\r\n\r\n"It was the principal business of clerks to help people to make their\r\nselections in my day," I replied.\r\n\r\n"What! To tell people what they wanted?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and oftener to induce them to buy what they didn\'t want."\r\n\r\n"But did not ladies find that very impertinent?" Edith asked,\r\nwonderingly. "What concern could it possibly be to the clerks whether\r\npeople bought or not?"\r\n\r\n"It was their sole concern," I answered. "They were hired for the\r\npurpose of getting rid of the goods, and were expected to do their\r\nutmost, short of the use of force, to compass that end."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes! How stupid I am to forget!" said Edith. "The storekeeper and\r\nhis clerks depended for their livelihood on selling the goods in your\r\nday. Of course that is all different now. The goods are the nation\'s.\r\nThey are here for those who want them, and it is the business of the\r\nclerks to wait on people and take their orders; but it is not the\r\ninterest of the clerk or the nation to dispose of a yard or a pound of\r\nanything to anybody who does not want it." She smiled as she added,\r\n"How exceedingly odd it must have seemed to have clerks trying to\r\ninduce one to take what one did not want, or was doubtful about!"\r\n\r\n"But even a twentieth-century clerk might make himself useful in\r\ngiving you information about the goods, though he did not tease you to\r\nbuy them," I suggested.\r\n\r\n"No," said Edith, "that is not the business of the clerk. These\r\nprinted cards, for which the government authorities are responsible,\r\ngive us all the information we can possibly need."\r\n\r\nI saw then that there was fastened to each sample a card containing in\r\nsuccinct form a complete statement of the make and materials of the\r\ngoods and all its qualities, as well as price, leaving absolutely no\r\npoint to hang a question on.\r\n\r\n"The clerk has, then, nothing to say about the goods he sells?" I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"Nothing at all. It is not necessary that he should know or profess to\r\nknow anything about them. Courtesy and accuracy in taking orders are\r\nall that are required of him."\r\n\r\n"What a prodigious amount of lying that simple arrangement saves!" I\r\nejaculated.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that all the clerks misrepresented their goods in your\r\nday?" Edith asked.\r\n\r\n"God forbid that I should say so!" I replied, "for there were many who\r\ndid not, and they were entitled to especial credit, for when one\'s\r\nlivelihood and that of his wife and babies depended on the amount of\r\ngoods he could dispose of, the temptation to deceive the customer--or\r\nlet him deceive himself--was wellnigh overwhelming. But, Miss Leete, I\r\nam distracting you from your task with my talk."\r\n\r\n"Not at all. I have made my selections." With that she touched a\r\nbutton, and in a moment a clerk appeared. He took down her order on a\r\ntablet with a pencil which made two copies, of which he gave one to\r\nher, and enclosing the counterpart in a small receptacle, dropped it\r\ninto a transmitting tube.\r\n\r\n"The duplicate of the order," said Edith as she turned away from the\r\ncounter, after the clerk had punched the value of her purchase out of\r\nthe credit card she gave him, "is given to the purchaser, so that any\r\nmistakes in filling it can be easily traced and rectified."\r\n\r\n"You were very quick about your selections," I said. "May I ask how\r\nyou knew that you might not have found something to suit you better in\r\nsome of the other stores? But probably you are required to buy in your\r\nown district."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," she replied. "We buy where we please, though naturally most\r\noften near home. But I should have gained nothing by visiting other\r\nstores. The assortment in all is exactly the same, representing as it\r\ndoes in each case samples of all the varieties produced or imported by\r\nthe United States. That is why one can decide quickly, and never need\r\nvisit two stores."\r\n\r\n"And is this merely a sample store? I see no clerks cutting off goods\r\nor marking bundles."\r\n\r\n"All our stores are sample stores, except as to a few classes of\r\narticles. The goods, with these exceptions, are all at the great\r\ncentral warehouse of the city, to which they are shipped directly from\r\nthe producers. We order from the sample and the printed statement of\r\ntexture, make, and qualities. The orders are sent to the warehouse,\r\nand the goods distributed from there."\r\n\r\n"That must be a tremendous saving of handling," I said. "By our\r\nsystem, the manufacturer sold to the wholesaler, the wholesaler to the\r\nretailer, and the retailer to the consumer, and the goods had to be\r\nhandled each time. You avoid one handling of the goods, and eliminate\r\nthe retailer altogether, with his big profit and the army of clerks it\r\ngoes to support. Why, Miss Leete, this store is merely the order\r\ndepartment of a wholesale house, with no more than a wholesaler\'s\r\ncomplement of clerks. Under our system of handling the goods,\r\npersuading the customer to buy them, cutting them off, and packing\r\nthem, ten clerks would not do what one does here. The saving must be\r\nenormous."\r\n\r\n"I suppose so," said Edith, "but of course we have never known any\r\nother way. But, Mr. West, you must not fail to ask father to take you\r\nto the central warehouse some day, where they receive the orders from\r\nthe different sample houses all over the city and parcel out and send\r\nthe goods to their destinations. He took me there not long ago, and\r\nit was a wonderful sight. The system is certainly perfect; for\r\nexample, over yonder in that sort of cage is the dispatching clerk.\r\nThe orders, as they are taken by the different departments in the\r\nstore, are sent by transmitters to him. His assistants sort them and\r\nenclose each class in a carrier-box by itself. The dispatching clerk\r\nhas a dozen pneumatic transmitters before him answering to the general\r\nclasses of goods, each communicating with the corresponding department\r\nat the warehouse. He drops the box of orders into the tube it calls\r\nfor, and in a few moments later it drops on the proper desk in the\r\nwarehouse, together with all the orders of the same sort from the\r\nother sample stores. The orders are read off, recorded, and sent to be\r\nfilled, like lightning. The filling I thought the most interesting\r\npart. Bales of cloth are placed on spindles and turned by machinery,\r\nand the cutter, who also has a machine, works right through one bale\r\nafter another till exhausted, when another man takes his place; and it\r\nis the same with those who fill the orders in any other staple. The\r\npackages are then delivered by larger tubes to the city districts, and\r\nthence distributed to the houses. You may understand how quickly it is\r\nall done when I tell you that my order will probably be at home sooner\r\nthan I could have carried it from here."\r\n\r\n"How do you manage in the thinly settled rural districts?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"The system is the same," Edith explained; "the village sample shops\r\nare connected by transmitters with the central county warehouse, which\r\nmay be twenty miles away. The transmission is so swift, though, that\r\nthe time lost on the way is trifling. But, to save expense, in many\r\ncounties one set of tubes connect several villages with the warehouse,\r\nand then there is time lost waiting for one another. Sometimes it is\r\ntwo or three hours before goods ordered are received. It was so where\r\nI was staying last summer, and I found it quite inconvenient".[2]\r\n\r\n"There must be many other respects also, no doubt, in which the\r\ncountry stores are inferior to the city stores," I suggested.\r\n\r\n"No," Edith answered, "they are otherwise precisely as good. The\r\nsample shop of the smallest village, just like this one, gives you\r\nyour choice of all the varieties of goods the nation has, for the\r\ncounty warehouse draws on the same source as the city warehouse."\r\n\r\nAs we walked home I commented on the great variety in the size and\r\ncost of the houses. "How is it," I asked, "that this difference is\r\nconsistent with the fact that all citizens have the same income?"\r\n\r\n"Because," Edith explained, "although the income is the same, personal\r\ntaste determines how the individual shall spend it. Some like fine\r\nhorses; others, like myself, prefer pretty clothes; and still others\r\nwant an elaborate table. The rents which the nation receives for these\r\nhouses vary, according to size, elegance, and location, so that\r\neverybody can find something to suit. The larger houses are usually\r\noccupied by large families, in which there are several to contribute\r\nto the rent; while small families, like ours, find smaller houses more\r\nconvenient and economical. It is a matter of taste and convenience\r\nwholly. I have read that in old times people often kept up\r\nestablishments and did other things which they could not afford for\r\nostentation, to make people think them richer than they were. Was it\r\nreally so, Mr. West?"\r\n\r\n"I shall have to admit that it was," I replied.\r\n\r\n"Well, you see, it could not be so nowadays; for everybody\'s income is\r\nknown, and it is known that what is spent one way must be saved\r\nanother."\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: I am informed since the above is in type that this lack\r\nof perfection in the distributing service of some of the country\r\ndistricts is to be remedied, and that soon every village will have its\r\nown set of tubes.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived home, Dr. Leete had not yet returned, and Mrs. Leete\r\nwas not visible. "Are you fond of music, Mr. West?" Edith asked.\r\n\r\nI assured her that it was half of life, according to my notion.\r\n\r\n"I ought to apologize for inquiring," she said. "It is not a question\r\nthat we ask one another nowadays; but I have read that in your day,\r\neven among the cultured class, there were some who did not care for\r\nmusic."\r\n\r\n"You must remember, in excuse," I said, "that we had some rather\r\nabsurd kinds of music."\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said, "I know that; I am afraid I should not have fancied\r\nit all myself. Would you like to hear some of ours now, Mr. West?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing would delight me so much as to listen to you," I said.\r\n\r\n"To me!" she exclaimed, laughing. "Did you think I was going to play\r\nor sing to you?"\r\n\r\n"I hoped so, certainly," I replied.\r\n\r\nSeeing that I was a little abashed, she subdued her merriment and\r\nexplained. "Of course, we all sing nowadays as a matter of course in\r\nthe training of the voice, and some learn to play instruments for\r\ntheir private amusement; but the professional music is so much grander\r\nand more perfect than any performance of ours, and so easily commanded\r\nwhen we wish to hear it, that we don\'t think of calling our singing or\r\nplaying music at all. All the really fine singers and players are in\r\nthe musical service, and the rest of us hold our peace for the main\r\npart. But would you really like to hear some music?"\r\n\r\nI assured her once more that I would.\r\n\r\n"Come, then, into the music room," she said, and I followed her into\r\nan apartment finished, without hangings, in wood, with a floor of\r\npolished wood. I was prepared for new devices in musical instruments,\r\nbut I saw nothing in the room which by any stretch of imagination\r\ncould be conceived as such. It was evident that my puzzled appearance\r\nwas affording intense amusement to Edith.\r\n\r\n"Please look at to-day\'s music," she said, handing me a card, "and\r\ntell me what you would prefer. It is now five o\'clock, you will\r\nremember."\r\n\r\nThe card bore the date "September 12, 2000," and contained the longest\r\nprogramme of music I had ever seen. It was as various as it was long,\r\nincluding a most extraordinary range of vocal and instrumental solos,\r\nduets, quartettes, and various orchestral combinations. I remained\r\nbewildered by the prodigious list until Edith\'s pink finger-tip\r\nindicated a particular section of it, where several selections were\r\nbracketed, with the words "5 P.M." against them; then I observed\r\nthat this prodigious programme was an all-day one, divided into\r\ntwenty-four sections answering to the hours. There were but a few\r\npieces of music in the "5 P.M." section, and I indicated an organ\r\npiece as my preference.\r\n\r\n"I am so glad you like the organ," said she. "I think there is\r\nscarcely any music that suits my mood oftener."\r\n\r\nShe made me sit down comfortably, and, crossing the room, so far as I\r\ncould see, merely touched one or two screws, and at once the room was\r\nfilled with the music of a grand organ anthem; filled, not flooded,\r\nfor, by some means, the volume of melody had been perfectly graduated\r\nto the size of the apartment. I listened, scarcely breathing, to the\r\nclose. Such music, so perfectly rendered, I had never expected to\r\nhear.\r\n\r\n"Grand!" I cried, as the last great wave of sound broke and ebbed away\r\ninto silence. "Bach must be at the keys of that organ; but where is\r\nthe organ?"\r\n\r\n"Wait a moment, please," said Edith; "I want to have you listen to\r\nthis waltz before you ask any questions. I think it is perfectly\r\ncharming;" and as she spoke the sound of violins filled the room with\r\nthe witchery of a summer night. When this had also ceased, she said:\r\n"There is nothing in the least mysterious about the music, as you seem\r\nto imagine. It is not made by fairies or genii, but by good, honest,\r\nand exceedingly clever human hands. We have simply carried the idea of\r\nlabor saving by cooperation into our musical service as into\r\neverything else. There are a number of music rooms in the city,\r\nperfectly adapted acoustically to the different sorts of music. These\r\nhalls are connected by telephone with all the houses of the city whose\r\npeople care to pay the small fee, and there are none, you may be sure,\r\nwho do not. The corps of musicians attached to each hall is so large\r\nthat, although no individual performer, or group of performers, has\r\nmore than a brief part, each day\'s programme lasts through the\r\ntwenty-four hours. There are on that card for to-day, as you will see\r\nif you observe closely, distinct programmes of four of these concerts,\r\neach of a different order of music from the others, being now\r\nsimultaneously performed, and any one of the four pieces now going on\r\nthat you prefer, you can hear by merely pressing the button which will\r\nconnect your house-wire with the hall where it is being rendered. The\r\nprogrammes are so coordinated that the pieces at any one time\r\nsimultaneously proceeding in the different halls usually offer a\r\nchoice, not only between instrumental and vocal, and between different\r\nsorts of instruments; but also between different motives from grave to\r\ngay, so that all tastes and moods can be suited."\r\n\r\n"It appears to me, Miss Leete," I said, "that if we could have devised\r\nan arrangement for providing everybody with music in their homes,\r\nperfect in quality, unlimited in quantity, suited to every mood, and\r\nbeginning and ceasing at will, we should have considered the limit of\r\nhuman felicity already attained, and ceased to strive for further\r\nimprovements."\r\n\r\n"I am sure I never could imagine how those among you who depended at\r\nall on music managed to endure the old-fashioned system for providing\r\nit," replied Edith. "Music really worth hearing must have been, I\r\nsuppose, wholly out of the reach of the masses, and attainable by the\r\nmost favored only occasionally, at great trouble, prodigious expense,\r\nand then for brief periods, arbitrarily fixed by somebody else, and in\r\nconnection with all sorts of undesirable circumstances. Your concerts,\r\nfor instance, and operas! How perfectly exasperating it must have\r\nbeen, for the sake of a piece or two of music that suited you, to have\r\nto sit for hours listening to what you did not care for! Now, at a\r\ndinner one can skip the courses one does not care for. Who would ever\r\ndine, however hungry, if required to eat everything brought on the\r\ntable? and I am sure one\'s hearing is quite as sensitive as one\'s\r\ntaste. I suppose it was these difficulties in the way of commanding\r\nreally good music which made you endure so much playing and singing in\r\nyour homes by people who had only the rudiments of the art."\r\n\r\n"Yes," I replied, "it was that sort of music or none for most of us."\r\n\r\n"Ah, well," Edith sighed, "when one really considers, it is not so\r\nstrange that people in those days so often did not care for music. I\r\ndare say I should have detested it, too."\r\n\r\n"Did I understand you rightly," I inquired, "that this musical\r\nprogramme covers the entire twenty-four hours? It seems to on this\r\ncard, certainly; but who is there to listen to music between say\r\nmidnight and morning?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, many," Edith replied. "Our people keep all hours; but if the\r\nmusic were provided from midnight to morning for no others, it still\r\nwould be for the sleepless, the sick, and the dying. All our\r\nbedchambers have a telephone attachment at the head of the bed by\r\nwhich any person who may be sleepless can command music at pleasure,\r\nof the sort suited to the mood."\r\n\r\n"Is there such an arrangement in the room assigned to me?"\r\n\r\n"Why, certainly; and how stupid, how very stupid, of me not to think\r\nto tell you of that last night! Father will show you about the\r\nadjustment before you go to bed to-night, however; and with the\r\nreceiver at your ear, I am quite sure you will be able to snap your\r\nfingers at all sorts of uncanny feelings if they trouble you again."\r\n\r\nThat evening Dr. Leete asked us about our visit to the store, and in\r\nthe course of the desultory comparison of the ways of the nineteenth\r\ncentury and the twentieth, which followed, something raised the\r\nquestion of inheritance. "I suppose," I said, "the inheritance of\r\nproperty is not now allowed."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary," replied Dr. Leete, "there is no interference with\r\nit. In fact, you will find, Mr. West, as you come to know us, that\r\nthere is far less interference of any sort with personal liberty\r\nnowadays than you were accustomed to. We require, indeed, by law that\r\nevery man shall serve the nation for a fixed period, instead of\r\nleaving him his choice, as you did, between working, stealing, or\r\nstarving. With the exception of this fundamental law, which is,\r\nindeed, merely a codification of the law of nature--the edict of\r\nEden--by which it is made equal in its pressure on men, our system\r\ndepends in no particular upon legislation, but is entirely voluntary,\r\nthe logical outcome of the operation of human nature under rational\r\nconditions. This question of inheritance illustrates just that point.\r\nThe fact that the nation is the sole capitalist and land-owner of\r\ncourse restricts the individual\'s possessions to his annual credit,\r\nand what personal and household belongings he may have procured with\r\nit. His credit, like an annuity in your day, ceases on his death, with\r\nthe allowance of a fixed sum for funeral expenses. His other\r\npossessions he leaves as he pleases."\r\n\r\n"What is to prevent, in course of time, such accumulations of valuable\r\ngoods and chattels in the hands of individuals as might seriously\r\ninterfere with equality in the circumstances of citizens?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"That matter arranges itself very simply," was the reply. "Under the\r\npresent organization of society, accumulations of personal property\r\nare merely burdensome the moment they exceed what adds to the real\r\ncomfort. In your day, if a man had a house crammed full with gold and\r\nsilver plate, rare china, expensive furniture, and such things, he was\r\nconsidered rich, for these things represented money, and could at any\r\ntime be turned into it. Nowadays a man whom the legacies of a hundred\r\nrelatives, simultaneously dying, should place in a similar position,\r\nwould be considered very unlucky. The articles, not being salable,\r\nwould be of no value to him except for their actual use or the\r\nenjoyment of their beauty. On the other hand, his income remaining the\r\nsame, he would have to deplete his credit to hire houses to store the\r\ngoods in, and still further to pay for the service of those who took\r\ncare of them. You may be very sure that such a man would lose no time\r\nin scattering among his friends possessions which only made him the\r\npoorer, and that none of those friends would accept more of them than\r\nthey could easily spare room for and time to attend to. You see, then,\r\nthat to prohibit the inheritance of personal property with a view to\r\nprevent great accumulations would be a superfluous precaution for the\r\nnation. The individual citizen can be trusted to see that he is not\r\noverburdened. So careful is he in this respect, that the relatives\r\nusually waive claim to most of the effects of deceased friends,\r\nreserving only particular objects. The nation takes charge of the\r\nresigned chattels, and turns such as are of value into the common\r\nstock once more."\r\n\r\n"You spoke of paying for service to take care of your houses," said I;\r\n"that suggests a question I have several times been on the point of\r\nasking. How have you disposed of the problem of domestic service? Who\r\nare willing to be domestic servants in a community where all are\r\nsocial equals? Our ladies found it hard enough to find such even when\r\nthere was little pretense of social equality."\r\n\r\n"It is precisely because we are all social equals whose equality\r\nnothing can compromise, and because service is honorable, in a society\r\nwhose fundamental principle is that all in turn shall serve the rest,\r\nthat we could easily provide a corps of domestic servants such as you\r\nnever dreamed of, if we needed them," replied Dr. Leete. "But we do\r\nnot need them."\r\n\r\n"Who does your housework, then?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"There is none to do," said Mrs. Leete, to whom I had addressed this\r\nquestion. "Our washing is all done at public laundries at excessively\r\ncheap rates, and our cooking at public kitchens The making and\r\nrepairing of all we wear are done outside in public shops.\r\nElectricity, of course, takes the place of all fires and lighting. We\r\nchoose houses no larger than we need, and furnish them so as to\r\ninvolve the minimum of trouble to keep them in order. We have no use\r\nfor domestic servants."\r\n\r\n"The fact," said Dr. Leete, "that you had in the poorer classes a\r\nboundless supply of serfs on whom you could impose all sorts of\r\npainful and disagreeable tasks, made you indifferent to devices to\r\navoid the necessity for them. But now that we all have to do in turn\r\nwhatever work is done for society, every individual in the nation has\r\nthe same interest, and a personal one, in devices for lightening the\r\nburden. This fact has given a prodigious impulse to labor-saving\r\ninventions in all sorts of industry, of which the combination of the\r\nmaximum of comfort and minimum of trouble in household arrangements\r\nwas one of the earliest results.\r\n\r\n"In case of special emergencies in the household," pursued Dr. Leete,\r\n"such as extensive cleaning or renovation, or sickness in the family,\r\nwe can always secure assistance from the industrial force."\r\n\r\n"But how do you recompense these assistants, since you have no money?"\r\n\r\n"We do not pay them, of course, but the nation for them. Their\r\nservices can be obtained by application at the proper bureau, and\r\ntheir value is pricked off the credit card of the applicant."\r\n\r\n"What a paradise for womankind the world must be now!" I exclaimed.\r\n"In my day, even wealth and unlimited servants did not enfranchise\r\ntheir possessors from household cares, while the women of the merely\r\nwell-to-do and poorer classes lived and died martyrs to them."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mrs. Leete, "I have read something of that; enough to\r\nconvince me that, badly off as the men, too, were in your day, they\r\nwere more fortunate than their mothers and wives."\r\n\r\n"The broad shoulders of the nation," said Dr. Leete, "bear now like a\r\nfeather the burden that broke the backs of the women of your day.\r\nTheir misery came, with all your other miseries, from that incapacity\r\nfor cooperation which followed from the individualism on which your\r\nsocial system was founded, from your inability to perceive that you\r\ncould make ten times more profit out of your fellow men by uniting\r\nwith them than by contending with them. The wonder is, not that you\r\ndid not live more comfortably, but that you were able to live together\r\nat all, who were all confessedly bent on making one another your\r\nservants, and securing possession of one another\'s goods."\r\n\r\n"There, there, father, if you are so vehement, Mr. West will think you\r\nare scolding him," laughingly interposed Edith.\r\n\r\n"When you want a doctor," I asked, "do you simply apply to the proper\r\nbureau and take any one that may be sent?"\r\n\r\n"That rule would not work well in the case of physicians," replied Dr.\r\nLeete. "The good a physician can do a patient depends largely on his\r\nacquaintance with his constitutional tendencies and condition. The\r\npatient must be able, therefore, to call in a particular doctor, and\r\nhe does so just as patients did in your day. The only difference is\r\nthat, instead of collecting his fee for himself, the doctor collects\r\nit for the nation by pricking off the amount, according to a regular\r\nscale for medical attendance, from the patient\'s credit card."\r\n\r\n"I can imagine," I said, "that if the fee is always the same, and a\r\ndoctor may not turn away patients, as I suppose he may not, the good\r\ndoctors are called constantly and the poor doctors left in idleness."\r\n\r\n"In the first place, if you will overlook the apparent conceit of the\r\nremark from a retired physician," replied Dr. Leete, with a smile, "we\r\nhave no poor doctors. Anybody who pleases to get a little smattering\r\nof medical terms is not now at liberty to practice on the bodies of\r\ncitizens, as in your day. None but students who have passed the severe\r\ntests of the schools, and clearly proved their vocation, are permitted\r\nto practice. Then, too, you will observe that there is nowadays no\r\nattempt of doctors to build up their practice at the expense of other\r\ndoctors. There would be no motive for that. For the rest, the doctor\r\nhas to render regular reports of his work to the medical bureau, and\r\nif he is not reasonably well employed, work is found for him."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe questions which I needed to ask before I could acquire even an\r\noutline acquaintance with the institutions of the twentieth century\r\nbeing endless, and Dr. Leete\'s good-nature appearing equally so, we\r\nsat up talking for several hours after the ladies left us. Reminding\r\nmy host of the point at which our talk had broken off that morning, I\r\nexpressed my curiosity to learn how the organization of the industrial\r\narmy was made to afford a sufficient stimulus to diligence in the lack\r\nof any anxiety on the worker\'s part as to his livelihood.\r\n\r\n"You must understand in the first place," replied the doctor, "that\r\nthe supply of incentives to effort is but one of the objects sought in\r\nthe organization we have adopted for the army. The other, and equally\r\nimportant, is to secure for the file-leaders and captains of the\r\nforce, and the great officers of the nation, men of proven abilities,\r\nwho are pledged by their own careers to hold their followers up to\r\ntheir highest standard of performance and permit no lagging. With a\r\nview to these two ends the industrial army is organized. First comes\r\nthe unclassified grade of common laborers, men of all work, to which\r\nall recruits during their first three years belong. This grade is a\r\nsort of school, and a very strict one, in which the young men are\r\ntaught habits of obedience, subordination, and devotion to duty. While\r\nthe miscellaneous nature of the work done by this force prevents the\r\nsystematic grading of the workers which is afterwards possible, yet\r\nindividual records are kept, and excellence receives distinction\r\ncorresponding with the penalties that negligence incurs. It is not,\r\nhowever, policy with us to permit youthful recklessness or\r\nindiscretion, when not deeply culpable, to handicap the future careers\r\nof young men, and all who have passed through the unclassified grade\r\nwithout serious disgrace have an equal opportunity to choose the life\r\nemployment they have most liking for. Having selected this, they enter\r\nupon it as apprentices. The length of the apprenticeship naturally\r\ndiffers in different occupations. At the end of it the apprentice\r\nbecomes a full workman, and a member of his trade or guild. Now not\r\nonly are the individual records of the apprentices for ability and\r\nindustry strictly kept, and excellence distinguished by suitable\r\ndistinctions, but upon the average of his record during apprenticeship\r\nthe standing given the apprentice among the full workmen depends.\r\n\r\n"While the internal organizations of different industries, mechanical\r\nand agricultural, differ according to their peculiar conditions, they\r\nagree in a general division of their workers into first, second, and\r\nthird grades, according to ability, and these grades are in many cases\r\nsubdivided into first and second classes. According to his standing as\r\nan apprentice a young man is assigned his place as a first, second, or\r\nthird grade worker. Of course only young men of unusual ability pass\r\ndirectly from apprenticeship into the first grade of the workers. The\r\nmost fall into the lower grades, working up as they grow more\r\nexperienced, at the periodical regradings. These regradings take place\r\nin each industry at intervals corresponding with the length of the\r\napprenticeship to that industry, so that merit never need wait long to\r\nrise, nor can any rest on past achievements unless they would drop\r\ninto a lower rank. One of the notable advantages of a high grading is\r\nthe privilege it gives the worker in electing which of the various\r\nbranches or processes of his industry he will follow as his specialty.\r\nOf course it is not intended that any of these processes shall be\r\ndisproportionately arduous, but there is often much difference between\r\nthem, and the privilege of election is accordingly highly prized. So\r\nfar as possible, indeed, the preferences even of the poorest workmen\r\nare considered in assigning them their line of work, because not only\r\ntheir happiness but their usefulness is thus enhanced. While, however,\r\nthe wish of the lower grade man is consulted so far as the exigencies\r\nof the service permit, he is considered only after the upper grade men\r\nhave been provided for, and often he has to put up with second or\r\nthird choice, or even with an arbitrary assignment when help is\r\nneeded. This privilege of election attends every regrading, and when a\r\nman loses his grade he also risks having to exchange the sort of work\r\nhe likes for some other less to his taste. The results of each\r\nregrading, giving the standing of every man in his industry, are\r\ngazetted in the public prints, and those who have won promotion since\r\nthe last regrading receive the nation\'s thanks and are publicly\r\ninvested with the badge of their new rank."\r\n\r\n"What may this badge be?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Every industry has its emblematic device," replied Dr. Leete, "and\r\nthis, in the shape of a metallic badge so small that you might not see\r\nit unless you knew where to look, is all the insignia which the men of\r\nthe army wear, except where public convenience demands a distinctive\r\nuniform. This badge is the same in form for all grades of industry,\r\nbut while the badge of the third grade is iron, that of the second\r\ngrade is silver, and that of the first is gilt.\r\n\r\n"Apart from the grand incentive to endeavor afforded by the fact that\r\nthe high places in the nation are open only to the highest class men,\r\nand that rank in the army constitutes the only mode of social\r\ndistinction for the vast majority who are not aspirants in art,\r\nliterature, and the professions, various incitements of a minor, but\r\nperhaps equally effective, sort are provided in the form of special\r\nprivileges and immunities in the way of discipline, which the superior\r\nclass men enjoy. These, while intended to be as little as possible\r\ninvidious to the less successful, have the effect of keeping\r\nconstantly before every man\'s mind the great desirability of attaining\r\nthe grade next above his own.\r\n\r\n"It is obviously important that not only the good but also the\r\nindifferent and poor workmen should be able to cherish the ambition of\r\nrising. Indeed, the number of the latter being so much greater, it is\r\neven more essential that the ranking system should not operate to\r\ndiscourage them than that it should stimulate the others. It is to\r\nthis end that the grades are divided into classes. The grades as well\r\nas the classes being made numerically equal at each regrading, there\r\nis not at any time, counting out the officers and the unclassified and\r\napprentice grades, over one-ninth of the industrial army in the lowest\r\nclass, and most of this number are recent apprentices, all of whom\r\nexpect to rise. Those who remain during the entire term of service in\r\nthe lowest class are but a trifling fraction of the industrial army,\r\nand likely to be as deficient in sensibility to their position as in\r\nability to better it.\r\n\r\n"It is not even necessary that a worker should win promotion to a\r\nhigher grade to have at least a taste of glory. While promotion\r\nrequires a general excellence of record as a worker, honorable\r\nmention and various sorts of prizes are awarded for excellence less\r\nthan sufficient for promotion, and also for special feats and single\r\nperformances in the various industries. There are many minor\r\ndistinctions of standing, not only within the grades but within the\r\nclasses, each of which acts as a spur to the efforts of a group. It is\r\nintended that no form of merit shall wholly fail of recognition.\r\n\r\n"As for actual neglect of work, positively bad work, or other overt\r\nremissness on the part of men incapable of generous motives, the\r\ndiscipline of the industrial army is far too strict to allow anything\r\nwhatever of the sort. A man able to do duty, and persistently\r\nrefusing, is sentenced to solitary imprisonment on bread and water\r\ntill he consents.\r\n\r\n"The lowest grade of the officers of the industrial army, that of\r\nassistant foremen or lieutenants, is appointed out of men who have\r\nheld their place for two years in the first class of the first grade.\r\nWhere this leaves too large a range of choice, only the first group of\r\nthis class are eligible. No one thus comes to the point of commanding\r\nmen until he is about thirty years old. After a man becomes an\r\nofficer, his rating of course no longer depends on the efficiency of\r\nhis own work, but on that of his men. The foremen are appointed from\r\namong the assistant foremen, by the same exercise of discretion\r\nlimited to a small eligible class. In the appointments to the still\r\nhigher grades another principle is introduced, which it would take\r\ntoo much time to explain now.\r\n\r\n"Of course such a system of grading as I have described would have\r\nbeen impracticable applied to the small industrial concerns of your\r\nday, in some of which there were hardly enough employees to have left\r\none apiece for the classes. You must remember that, under the national\r\norganization of labor, all industries are carried on by great bodies\r\nof men, many of your farms or shops being combined as one. It is also\r\nowing solely to the vast scale on which each industry is organized,\r\nwith coordinate establishments in every part of the country, that we\r\nare able by exchanges and transfers to fit every man so nearly with\r\nthe sort of work he can do best.\r\n\r\n"And now, Mr. West, I will leave it to you, on the bare outline of its\r\nfeatures which I have given, if those who need special incentives to\r\ndo their best are likely to lack them under our system. Does it not\r\nseem to you that men who found themselves obliged, whether they wished\r\nor not, to work, would under such a system be strongly impelled to do\r\ntheir best?"\r\n\r\nI replied that it seemed to me the incentives offered were, if any\r\nobjection were to be made, too strong; that the pace set for the young\r\nmen was too hot; and such, indeed, I would add with deference, still\r\nremains my opinion, now that by longer residence among you I have\r\nbecome better acquainted with the whole subject.\r\n\r\nDr. Leete, however, desired me to reflect, and I am ready to say that\r\nit is perhaps a sufficient reply to my objection, that the worker\'s\r\nlivelihood is in no way dependent on his ranking, and anxiety for that\r\nnever embitters his disappointments; that the working hours are short,\r\nthe vacations regular, and that all emulation ceases at forty-five,\r\nwith the attainment of middle life.\r\n\r\n"There are two or three other points I ought to refer to," he added,\r\n"to prevent your getting mistaken impressions. In the first place, you\r\nmust understand that this system of preferment given the more\r\nefficient workers over the less so, in no way contravenes the\r\nfundamental idea of our social system, that all who do their best are\r\nequally deserving, whether that best be great or small. I have shown\r\nthat the system is arranged to encourage the weaker as well as the\r\nstronger with the hope of rising, while the fact that the stronger are\r\nselected for the leaders is in no way a reflection upon the weaker,\r\nbut in the interest of the common weal.\r\n\r\n"Do not imagine, either, because emulation is given free play as an\r\nincentive under our system, that we deem it a motive likely to appeal\r\nto the nobler sort of men, or worthy of them. Such as these find their\r\nmotives within, not without, and measure their duty by their own\r\nendowments, not by those of others. So long as their achievement is\r\nproportioned to their powers, they would consider it preposterous to\r\nexpect praise or blame because it chanced to be great or small. To\r\nsuch natures emulation appears philosophically absurd, and despicable\r\nin a moral aspect by its substitution of envy for admiration, and\r\nexultation for regret, in one\'s attitude toward the successes and the\r\nfailures of others.\r\n\r\n"But all men, even in the last year of the twentieth century, are not\r\nof this high order, and the incentives to endeavor requisite for those\r\nwho are not must be of a sort adapted to their inferior natures. For\r\nthese, then, emulation of the keenest edge is provided as a constant\r\nspur. Those who need this motive will feel it. Those who are above its\r\ninfluence do not need it.\r\n\r\n"I should not fail to mention," resumed the doctor, "that for those\r\ntoo deficient in mental or bodily strength to be fairly graded with\r\nthe main body of workers, we have a separate grade, unconnected with\r\nthe others,--a sort of invalid corps, the members of which are\r\nprovided with a light class of tasks fitted to their strength. All our\r\nsick in mind and body, all our deaf and dumb, and lame and blind and\r\ncrippled, and even our insane, belong to this invalid corps, and bear\r\nits insignia. The strongest often do nearly a man\'s work, the\r\nfeeblest, of course, nothing; but none who can do anything are willing\r\nquite to give up. In their lucid intervals, even our insane are eager\r\nto do what they can."\r\n\r\n"That is a pretty idea of the invalid corps," I said. "Even a\r\nbarbarian from the nineteenth century can appreciate that. It is a\r\nvery graceful way of disguising charity, and must be grateful to the\r\nfeelings of its recipients."\r\n\r\n"Charity!" repeated Dr. Leete. "Did you suppose that we consider the\r\nincapable class we are talking of objects of charity?"\r\n\r\n"Why, naturally," I said, "inasmuch as they are incapable of\r\nself-support."\r\n\r\nBut here the doctor took me up quickly.\r\n\r\n"Who is capable of self-support?" he demanded. "There is no such thing\r\nin a civilized society as self-support. In a state of society so\r\nbarbarous as not even to know family cooperation, each individual may\r\npossibly support himself, though even then for a part of his life\r\nonly; but from the moment that men begin to live together, and\r\nconstitute even the rudest sort of society, self-support becomes\r\nimpossible. As men grow more civilized, and the subdivision of\r\noccupations and services is carried out, a complex mutual dependence\r\nbecomes the universal rule. Every man, however solitary may seem his\r\noccupation, is a member of a vast industrial partnership, as large as\r\nthe nation, as large as humanity. The necessity of mutual dependence\r\nshould imply the duty and guarantee of mutual support; and that it did\r\nnot in your day constituted the essential cruelty and unreason of your\r\nsystem."\r\n\r\n"That may all be so," I replied, "but it does not touch the case of\r\nthose who are unable to contribute anything to the product of\r\nindustry."\r\n\r\n"Surely I told you this morning, at least I thought I did," replied\r\nDr. Leete, "that the right of a man to maintenance at the nation\'s\r\ntable depends on the fact that he is a man, and not on the amount of\r\nhealth and strength he may have, so long as he does his best."\r\n\r\n"You said so," I answered, "but I supposed the rule applied only to\r\nthe workers of different ability. Does it also hold of those who can\r\ndo nothing at all?"\r\n\r\n"Are they not also men?"\r\n\r\n"I am to understand, then, that the lame, the blind, the sick, and the\r\nimpotent, are as well off as the most efficient, and have the same\r\nincome?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly," was the reply.\r\n\r\n"The idea of charity on such a scale," I answered, "would have made\r\nour most enthusiastic philanthropists gasp."\r\n\r\n"If you had a sick brother at home," replied Dr. Leete, "unable to\r\nwork, would you feed him on less dainty food, and lodge and clothe him\r\nmore poorly, than yourself? More likely far, you would give him the\r\npreference; nor would you think of calling it charity. Would not the\r\nword, in that connection, fill you with indignation?"\r\n\r\n"Of course," I replied; "but the cases are not parallel. There is a\r\nsense, no doubt, in which all men are brothers; but this general sort\r\nof brotherhood is not to be compared, except for rhetorical purposes,\r\nto the brotherhood of blood, either as to its sentiment or its\r\nobligations."\r\n\r\n"There speaks the nineteenth century!" exclaimed Dr. Leete. "Ah, Mr.\r\nWest, there is no doubt as to the length of time that you slept. If I\r\nwere to give you, in one sentence, a key to what may seem the\r\nmysteries of our civilization as compared with that of your age, I\r\nshould say that it is the fact that the solidarity of the race and the\r\nbrotherhood of man, which to you were but fine phrases, are, to our\r\nthinking and feeling, ties as real and as vital as physical\r\nfraternity.\r\n\r\n"But even setting that consideration aside, I do not see why it so\r\nsurprises you that those who cannot work are conceded the full right\r\nto live on the produce of those who can. Even in your day, the duty of\r\nmilitary service for the protection of the nation, to which our\r\nindustrial service corresponds, while obligatory on those able to\r\ndischarge it, did not operate to deprive of the privileges of\r\ncitizenship those who were unable. They stayed at home, and were\r\nprotected by those who fought, and nobody questioned their right to\r\nbe, or thought less of them. So, now, the requirement of industrial\r\nservice from those able to render it does not operate to deprive of\r\nthe privileges of citizenship, which now implies the citizen\'s\r\nmaintenance, him who cannot work. The worker is not a citizen because\r\nhe works, but works because he is a citizen. As you recognize the duty\r\nof the strong to fight for the weak, we, now that fighting is gone by,\r\nrecognize his duty to work for him.\r\n\r\n"A solution which leaves an unaccounted-for residuum is no solution at\r\nall; and our solution of the problem of human society would have been\r\nnone at all had it left the lame, the sick, and the blind outside with\r\nthe beasts, to fare as they might. Better far have left the strong and\r\nwell unprovided for than these burdened ones, toward whom every heart\r\nmust yearn, and for whom ease of mind and body should be provided, if\r\nfor no others. Therefore it is, as I told you this morning, that the\r\ntitle of every man, woman, and child to the means of existence rests\r\non no basis less plain, broad, and simple than the fact that they are\r\nfellows of one race--members of one human family. The only coin\r\ncurrent is the image of God, and that is good for all we have.\r\n\r\n"I think there is no feature of the civilization of your epoch so\r\nrepugnant to modern ideas as the neglect with which you treated your\r\ndependent classes. Even if you had no pity, no feeling of brotherhood,\r\nhow was it that you did not see that you were robbing the incapable\r\nclass of their plain right in leaving them unprovided for?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t quite follow you there," I said. "I admit the claim of this\r\nclass to our pity, but how could they who produced nothing claim a\r\nshare of the product as a right?"\r\n\r\n"How happened it," was Dr. Leete\'s reply, "that your workers were able\r\nto produce more than so many savages would have done? Was it not\r\nwholly on account of the heritage of the past knowledge and\r\nachievements of the race, the machinery of society, thousands of years\r\nin contriving, found by you ready-made to your hand? How did you come\r\nto be possessors of this knowledge and this machinery, which represent\r\nnine parts to one contributed by yourself in the value of your\r\nproduct? You inherited it, did you not? And were not these others,\r\nthese unfortunate and crippled brothers whom you cast out, joint\r\ninheritors, co-heirs with you? What did you do with their share? Did\r\nyou not rob them when you put them off with crusts, who were entitled\r\nto sit with the heirs, and did you not add insult to robbery when you\r\ncalled the crusts charity?\r\n\r\n"Ah, Mr. West," Dr. Leete continued, as I did not respond, "what I do\r\nnot understand is, setting aside all considerations either of justice\r\nor brotherly feeling toward the crippled and defective, how the\r\nworkers of your day could have had any heart for their work, knowing\r\nthat their children, or grand-children, if unfortunate, would be\r\ndeprived of the comforts and even necessities of life. It is a mystery\r\nhow men with children could favor a system under which they were\r\nrewarded beyond those less endowed with bodily strength or mental\r\npower. For, by the same discrimination by which the father profited,\r\nthe son, for whom he would give his life, being perchance weaker than\r\nothers, might be reduced to crusts and beggary. How men dared leave\r\nchildren behind them, I have never been able to understand."\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--Although in his talk on the previous evening Dr. Leete\r\n    had emphasized the pains taken to enable every man to\r\n    ascertain and follow his natural bent in choosing an\r\n    occupation, it was not till I learned that the worker\'s\r\n    income is the same in all occupations that I realized how\r\n    absolutely he may be counted on to do so, and thus, by\r\n    selecting the harness which sets most lightly on himself,\r\n    find that in which he can pull best. The failure of my age in\r\n    any systematic or effective way to develop and utilize the\r\n    natural aptitudes of men for the industries and intellectual\r\n    avocations was one of the great wastes, as well as one of the\r\n    most common causes of unhappiness in that time. The vast\r\n    majority of my contemporaries, though nominally free to do\r\n    so, never really chose their occupations at all, but were\r\n    forced by circumstances into work for which they were\r\n    relatively inefficient, because not naturally fitted for it.\r\n    The rich, in this respect, had little advantage over the\r\n    poor. The latter, indeed, being generally deprived of\r\n    education, had no opportunity even to ascertain the natural\r\n    aptitudes they might have, and on account of their poverty\r\n    were unable to develop them by cultivation even when\r\n    ascertained. The liberal and technical professions, except by\r\n    favorable accident, were shut to them, to their own great\r\n    loss and that of the nation. On the other hand, the\r\n    well-to-do, although they could command education and\r\n    opportunity, were scarcely less hampered by social prejudice,\r\n    which forbade them to pursue manual avocations, even when\r\n    adapted to them, and destined them, whether fit or unfit, to\r\n    the professions, thus wasting many an excellent\r\n    handicraftsman. Mercenary considerations, tempting men to\r\n    pursue money-making occupations for which they were unfit,\r\n    instead of less remunerative employments for which they were\r\n    fit, were responsible for another vast perversion of talent.\r\n    All these things now are changed. Equal education and\r\n    opportunity must needs bring to light whatever aptitudes a\r\n    man has, and neither social prejudices nor mercenary\r\n    considerations hamper him in the choice of his life work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Edith had promised he should do, Dr. Leete accompanied me to my\r\nbedroom when I retired, to instruct me as to the adjustment of the\r\nmusical telephone. He showed how, by turning a screw, the volume of\r\nthe music could be made to fill the room, or die away to an echo so\r\nfaint and far that one could scarcely be sure whether he heard or\r\nimagined it. If, of two persons side by side, one desired to listen to\r\nmusic and the other to sleep, it could be made audible to one and\r\ninaudible to another.\r\n\r\n"I should strongly advise you to sleep if you can to-night, Mr. West,\r\nin preference to listening to the finest tunes in the world," the\r\ndoctor said, after explaining these points. "In the trying experience\r\nyou are just now passing through, sleep is a nerve tonic for which\r\nthere is no substitute."\r\n\r\nMindful of what had happened to me that very morning, I promised to\r\nheed his counsel.\r\n\r\n"Very well," he said, "then I will set the telephone at eight\r\no\'clock."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" I asked.\r\n\r\nHe explained that, by a clock-work combination, a person could arrange\r\nto be awakened at any hour by the music.\r\n\r\nIt began to appear, as has since fully proved to be the case, that I\r\nhad left my tendency to insomnia behind me with the other discomforts\r\nof existence in the nineteenth century; for though I took no sleeping\r\ndraught this time, yet, as the night before, I had no sooner touched\r\nthe pillow than I was asleep.\r\n\r\nI dreamed that I sat on the throne of the Abencerrages in the\r\nbanqueting hall of the Alhambra, feasting my lords and generals, who\r\nnext day were to follow the crescent against the Christian dogs of\r\nSpain. The air, cooled by the spray of fountains, was heavy with the\r\nscent of flowers. A band of Nautch girls, round-limbed and\r\nluscious-lipped, danced with voluptuous grace to the music of brazen\r\nand stringed instruments. Looking up to the latticed galleries, one\r\ncaught a gleam now and then from the eye of some beauty of the royal\r\nharem, looking down upon the assembled flower of Moorish chivalry.\r\nLouder and louder clashed the cymbals, wilder and wilder grew the\r\nstrain, till the blood of the desert race could no longer resist the\r\nmartial delirium, and the swart nobles leaped to their feet; a\r\nthousand scimitars were bared, and the cry, "Allah il Allah!" shook\r\nthe hall and awoke me, to find it broad daylight, and the room\r\ntingling with the electric music of the "Turkish Reveille."\r\n\r\nAt the breakfast-table, when I told my host of my morning\'s\r\nexperience, I learned that it was not a mere chance that the piece of\r\nmusic which awakened me was a reveille. The airs played at one of the\r\nhalls during the waking hours of the morning were always of an\r\ninspiring type.\r\n\r\n"By the way," I said, "I have not thought to ask you anything about\r\nthe state of Europe. Have the societies of the Old World also been\r\nremodeled?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Dr. Leete, "the great nations of Europe as well as\r\nAustralia, Mexico, and parts of South America, are now organized\r\nindustrially like the United States, which was the pioneer of the\r\nevolution. The peaceful relations of these nations are assured by a\r\nloose form of federal union of world-wide extent. An international\r\ncouncil regulates the mutual intercourse and commerce of the members\r\nof the union and their joint policy toward the more backward races,\r\nwhich are gradually being educated up to civilized institutions.\r\nComplete autonomy within its own limits is enjoyed by every nation."\r\n\r\n"How do you carry on commerce without money?" I said. "In trading with\r\nother nations, you must use some sort of money, although you dispense\r\nwith it in the internal affairs of the nation."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; money is as superfluous in our foreign as in our internal\r\nrelations. When foreign commerce was conducted by private enterprise,\r\nmoney was necessary to adjust it on account of the multifarious\r\ncomplexity of the transactions; but nowadays it is a function of the\r\nnations as units. There are thus only a dozen or so merchants in the\r\nworld, and their business being supervised by the international\r\ncouncil, a simple system of book accounts serves perfectly to regulate\r\ntheir dealings. Customs duties of every sort are of course\r\nsuperfluous. A nation simply does not import what its government does\r\nnot think requisite for the general interest. Each nation has a bureau\r\nof foreign exchange, which manages its trading. For example, the\r\nAmerican bureau, estimating such and such quantities of French goods\r\nnecessary to America for a given year, sends the order to the French\r\nbureau, which in turn sends its order to our bureau. The same is done\r\nmutually by all the nations."\r\n\r\n"But how are the prices of foreign goods settled, since there is no\r\ncompetition?"\r\n\r\n"The price at which one nation supplies another with goods," replied\r\nDr. Leete, "must be that at which it supplies its own citizens. So you\r\nsee there is no danger of misunderstanding. Of course no nation is\r\ntheoretically bound to supply another with the product of its own\r\nlabor, but it is for the interest of all to exchange some commodities.\r\nIf a nation is regularly supplying another with certain goods, notice\r\nis required from either side of any important change in the relation."\r\n\r\n"But what if a nation, having a monopoly of some natural product,\r\nshould refuse to supply it to the others, or to one of them?"\r\n\r\n"Such a case has never occurred, and could not without doing the\r\nrefusing party vastly more harm than the others," replied Dr. Leete.\r\n"In the first place, no favoritism could be legally shown. The law\r\nrequires that each nation shall deal with the others, in all respects,\r\non exactly the same footing. Such a course as you suggest would cut\r\noff the nation adopting it from the remainder of the earth for all\r\npurposes whatever. The contingency is one that need not give us much\r\nanxiety."\r\n\r\n"But," said I, "supposing a nation, having a natural monopoly in some\r\nproduct of which it exports more than it consumes, should put the\r\nprice away up, and thus, without cutting off the supply, make a profit\r\nout of its neighbors\' necessities? Its own citizens would of course\r\nhave to pay the higher price on that commodity, but as a body would\r\nmake more out of foreigners than they would be out of pocket\r\nthemselves."\r\n\r\n"When you come to know how prices of all commodities are determined\r\nnowadays, you will perceive how impossible it is that they could be\r\naltered, except with reference to the amount or arduousness of the\r\nwork required respectively to produce them," was Dr. Leete\'s reply.\r\n"This principle is an international as well as a national guarantee;\r\nbut even without it the sense of community of interest, international\r\nas well as national, and the conviction of the folly of selfishness,\r\nare too deep nowadays to render possible such a piece of sharp\r\npractice as you apprehend. You must understand that we all look\r\nforward to an eventual unification of the world as one nation. That,\r\nno doubt, will be the ultimate form of society, and will realize\r\ncertain economic advantages over the present federal system of\r\nautonomous nations. Meanwhile, however, the present system works so\r\nnearly perfectly that we are quite content to leave to posterity the\r\ncompletion of the scheme. There are, indeed, some who hold that it\r\nnever will be completed, on the ground that the federal plan is not\r\nmerely a provisional solution of the problem of human society, but the\r\nbest ultimate solution."\r\n\r\n"How do you manage," I asked, "when the books of any two nations do\r\nnot balance? Supposing we import more from France than we export to\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"At the end of each year," replied the doctor, "the books of every\r\nnation are examined. If France is found in our debt, probably we are\r\nin the debt of some nation which owes France, and so on with all the\r\nnations. The balances that remain after the accounts have been cleared\r\nby the international council should not be large under our system.\r\nWhatever they may be, the council requires them to be settled every\r\nfew years, and may require their settlement at any time if they are\r\ngetting too large; for it is not intended that any nation shall run\r\nlargely in debt to another, lest feelings unfavorable to amity should\r\nbe engendered. To guard further against this, the international\r\ncouncil inspects the commodities interchanged by the nations, to see\r\nthat they are of perfect quality."\r\n\r\n"But what are the balances finally settled with, seeing that you have\r\nno money?"\r\n\r\n"In national staples; a basis of agreement as to what staples shall be\r\naccepted, and in what proportions, for settlement of accounts, being a\r\npreliminary to trade relations."\r\n\r\n"Emigration is another point I want to ask you about," said I. "With\r\nevery nation organized as a close industrial partnership, monopolizing\r\nall means of production in the country, the emigrant, even if he were\r\npermitted to land, would starve. I suppose there is no emigration\r\nnowadays."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, there is constant emigration, by which I suppose you\r\nmean removal to foreign countries for permanent residence," replied\r\nDr. Leete. "It is arranged on a simple international arrangement of\r\nindemnities. For example, if a man at twenty-one emigrates from\r\nEngland to America, England loses all the expense of his maintenance\r\nand education, and America gets a workman for nothing. America\r\naccordingly makes England an allowance. The same principle, varied to\r\nsuit the case, applies generally. If the man is near the term of his\r\nlabor when he emigrates, the country receiving him has the allowance.\r\nAs to imbecile persons, it is deemed best that each nation should be\r\nresponsible for its own, and the emigration of such must be under\r\nfull guarantees of support by his own nation. Subject to these\r\nregulations, the right of any man to emigrate at any time is\r\nunrestricted."\r\n\r\n"But how about mere pleasure trips; tours of observation? How can a\r\nstranger travel in a country whose people do not receive money, and\r\nare themselves supplied with the means of life on a basis not extended\r\nto him? His own credit card cannot, of course, be good in other lands.\r\nHow does he pay his way?"\r\n\r\n"An American credit card," replied Dr. Leete, "is just as good in\r\nEurope as American gold used to be, and on precisely the same\r\ncondition, namely, that it be exchanged into the currency of the\r\ncountry you are traveling in. An American in Berlin takes his credit\r\ncard to the local office of the international council, and receives in\r\nexchange for the whole or part of it a German credit card, the amount\r\nbeing charged against the United States in favor of Germany on the\r\ninternational account."\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\n"Perhaps Mr. West would like to dine at the Elephant to-day," said\r\nEdith, as we left the table.\r\n\r\n"That is the name we give to the general dining-house of our ward,"\r\nexplained her father. "Not only is our cooking done at the public\r\nkitchens, as I told you last night, but the service and quality of the\r\nmeals are much more satisfactory if taken at the dining-house. The\r\ntwo minor meals of the day are usually taken at home, as not worth the\r\ntrouble of going out; but it is general to go out to dine. We have not\r\ndone so since you have been with us, from a notion that it would be\r\nbetter to wait till you had become a little more familiar with our\r\nways. What do you think? Shall we take dinner at the dining-house\r\nto-day?"\r\n\r\nI said that I should be very much pleased to do so.\r\n\r\nNot long after, Edith came to me, smiling, and said:--\r\n\r\n"Last night, as I was thinking what I could do to make you feel at\r\nhome until you came to be a little more used to us and our ways, an\r\nidea occurred to me. What would you say if I were to introduce you to\r\nsome very nice people of your own times, whom I am sure you used to be\r\nwell acquainted with?"\r\n\r\nI replied, rather vaguely, that it would certainly be very agreeable,\r\nbut I did not see how she was going to manage it.\r\n\r\n"Come with me," was her smiling reply, "and see if I am not as good as\r\nmy word."\r\n\r\nMy susceptibility to surprise had been pretty well exhausted by the\r\nnumerous shocks it had received, but it was with some wonderment that\r\nI followed her into a room which I had not before entered. It was a\r\nsmall, cosy apartment, walled with cases filled with books.\r\n\r\n"Here are your friends," said Edith, indicating one of the cases, and\r\nas my eye glanced over the names on the backs of the volumes,\r\nShakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth, Shelley, Tennyson, Defoe, Dickens,\r\nThackeray, Hugo, Hawthorne, Irving, and a score of other great writers\r\nof my time and all time, I understood her meaning. She had indeed made\r\ngood her promise in a sense compared with which its literal\r\nfulfillment would have been a disappointment. She had introduced me to\r\na circle of friends whom the century that had elapsed since last I\r\ncommuned with them had aged as little as it had myself. Their spirit\r\nwas as high, their wit as keen, their laughter and their tears as\r\ncontagious, as when their speech had whiled away the hours of a former\r\ncentury. Lonely I was not and could not be more, with this goodly\r\ncompanionship, however wide the gulf of years that gaped between me\r\nand my old life.\r\n\r\n"You are glad I brought you here," exclaimed Edith, radiant, as she\r\nread in my face the success of her experiment. "It was a good idea,\r\nwas it not, Mr. West? How stupid in me not to think of it before! I\r\nwill leave you now with your old friends, for I know there will be no\r\ncompany for you like them just now; but remember you must not let old\r\nfriends make you quite forget new ones!" and with that smiling caution\r\nshe left me.\r\n\r\nAttracted by the most familiar of the names before me, I laid my hand\r\non a volume of Dickens, and sat down to read. He had been my prime\r\nfavorite among the book-writers of the century,--I mean the nineteenth\r\ncentury,--and a week had rarely passed in my old life during which I\r\nhad not taken up some volume of his works to while away an idle hour.\r\nAny volume with which I had been familiar would have produced an\r\nextraordinary impression, read under my present circumstances, but my\r\nexceptional familiarity with Dickens, and his consequent power to call\r\nup the associations of my former life, gave to his writings an effect\r\nno others could have had, to intensify, by force of contrast, my\r\nappreciation of the strangeness of my present environment. However new\r\nand astonishing one\'s surroundings, the tendency is to become a part\r\nof them so soon that almost from the first the power to see them\r\nobjectively and fully measure their strangeness, is lost. That power,\r\nalready dulled in my case, the pages of Dickens restored by carrying\r\nme back through their associations to the standpoint of my former\r\nlife. With a clearness which I had not been able before to attain, I\r\nsaw now the past and present, like contrasting pictures, side by side.\r\n\r\nThe genius of the great novelist of the nineteenth century, like that\r\nof Homer, might indeed defy time; but the setting of his pathetic\r\ntales, the misery of the poor, the wrongs of power, the pitiless\r\ncruelty of the system of society, had passed away as utterly as Circe\r\nand the sirens, Charybdis and Cyclops.\r\n\r\nDuring the hour or two that I sat there with Dickens open before me, I\r\ndid not actually read more than a couple of pages. Every paragraph,\r\nevery phrase, brought up some new aspect of the world-transformation\r\nwhich had taken place, and led my thoughts on long and widely\r\nramifying excursions. As meditating thus in Dr. Leete\'s library I\r\ngradually attained a more clear and coherent idea of the prodigious\r\nspectacle which I had been so strangely enabled to view, I was filled\r\nwith a deepening wonder at the seeming capriciousness of the fate that\r\nhad given to one who so little deserved it, or seemed in any way set\r\napart for it, the power alone among his contemporaries to stand upon\r\nthe earth in this latter day. I had neither foreseen the new world nor\r\ntoiled for it, as many about me had done regardless of the scorn of\r\nfools or the misconstruction of the good. Surely it would have been\r\nmore in accordance with the fitness of things had one of those\r\nprophetic and strenuous souls been enabled to see the travail of his\r\nsoul and be satisfied; he, for example, a thousand times rather than\r\nI, who, having beheld in a vision the world I looked on, sang of it in\r\nwords that again and again, during these last wondrous days, had rung\r\nin my mind:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see.\r\n    Saw the vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be;\r\n\r\n    Till the war-drum throbbed no longer, and the battle-flags were furled.\r\n    In the Parliament of man, the federation of the world.\r\n\r\n    Then the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe,\r\n    And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law.\r\n\r\n    For I doubt not through the ages one increasing purpose runs,\r\n    And the thoughts of men are widened with the process of the suns.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat though, in his old age, he momentarily lost faith in his own\r\nprediction, as prophets in their hours of depression and doubt\r\ngenerally do; the words had remained eternal testimony to the seership\r\nof a poet\'s heart, the insight that is given to faith.\r\n\r\nI was still in the library when some hours later Dr. Leete sought me\r\nthere. "Edith told me of her idea," he said, "and I thought it an\r\nexcellent one. I had a little curiosity what writer you would first\r\nturn to. Ah, Dickens! You admired him, then! That is where we moderns\r\nagree with you. Judged by our standards, he overtops all the writers\r\nof his age, not because his literary genius was highest, but because\r\nhis great heart beat for the poor, because he made the cause of the\r\nvictims of society his own, and devoted his pen to exposing its\r\ncruelties and shams. No man of his time did so much as he to turn\r\nmen\'s minds to the wrong and wretchedness of the old order of things,\r\nand open their eyes to the necessity of the great change that was\r\ncoming, although he himself did not clearly foresee it."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nA heavy rainstorm came up during the day, and I had concluded that the\r\ncondition of the streets would be such that my hosts would have to\r\ngive up the idea of going out to dinner, although the dining-hall I\r\nhad understood to be quite near. I was much surprised when at the\r\ndinner hour the ladies appeared prepared to go out, but without either\r\nrubbers or umbrellas.\r\n\r\nThe mystery was explained when we found ourselves on the street, for a\r\ncontinuous waterproof covering had been let down so as to inclose the\r\nsidewalk and turn it into a well lighted and perfectly dry corridor,\r\nwhich was filled with a stream of ladies and gentlemen dressed for\r\ndinner. At the corners the entire open space was similarly roofed in.\r\nEdith Leete, with whom I walked, seemed much interested in learning\r\nwhat appeared to be entirely new to her, that in the stormy weather\r\nthe streets of the Boston of my day had been impassable, except to\r\npersons protected by umbrellas, boots, and heavy clothing. "Were\r\nsidewalk coverings not used at all?" she asked. They were used, I\r\nexplained, but in a scattered and utterly unsystematic way, being\r\nprivate enterprises. She said to me that at the present time all the\r\nstreets were provided against inclement weather in the manner I saw,\r\nthe apparatus being rolled out of the way when it was unnecessary. She\r\nintimated that it would be considered an extraordinary imbecility to\r\npermit the weather to have any effect on the social movements of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nDr. Leete, who was walking ahead, overhearing something of our talk,\r\nturned to say that the difference between the age of individualism and\r\nthat of concert was well characterized by the fact that, in the\r\nnineteenth century, when it rained, the people of Boston put up three\r\nhundred thousand umbrellas over as many heads, and in the twentieth\r\ncentury they put up one umbrella over all the heads.\r\n\r\nAs we walked on, Edith said, "The private umbrella is father\'s\r\nfavorite figure to illustrate the old way when everybody lived for\r\nhimself and his family. There is a nineteenth century painting at the\r\nArt Gallery representing a crowd of people in the rain, each one\r\nholding his umbrella over himself and his wife, and giving his\r\nneighbors the drippings, which he claims must have been meant by the\r\nartist as a satire on his times."\r\n\r\nWe now entered a large building into which a stream of people was\r\npouring. I could not see the front, owing to the awning, but, if in\r\ncorrespondence with the interior, which was even finer than the store\r\nI visited the day before, it would have been magnificent. My companion\r\nsaid that the sculptured group over the entrance was especially\r\nadmired. Going up a grand staircase we walked some distance along a\r\nbroad corridor with many doors opening upon it. At one of these, which\r\nbore my host\'s name, we turned in, and I found myself in an elegant\r\ndining-room containing a table for four. Windows opened on a courtyard\r\nwhere a fountain played to a great height and music made the air\r\nelectric.\r\n\r\n"You seem at home here," I said, as we seated ourselves at table, and\r\nDr. Leete touched an annunciator.\r\n\r\n"This is, in fact, a part of our house, slightly detached from the\r\nrest," he replied. "Every family in the ward has a room set apart in\r\nthis great building for its permanent and exclusive use for a small\r\nannual rental. For transient guests and individuals there is\r\naccommodation on another floor. If we expect to dine here, we put in\r\nour orders the night before, selecting anything in market, according\r\nto the daily reports in the papers. The meal is as expensive or as\r\nsimple as we please, though of course everything is vastly cheaper as\r\nwell as better than it would be if prepared at home. There is actually\r\nnothing which our people take more interest in than the perfection of\r\nthe catering and cooking done for them, and I admit that we are a\r\nlittle vain of the success that has been attained by this branch of\r\nthe service. Ah, my dear Mr. West, though other aspects of your\r\ncivilization were more tragical, I can imagine that none could have\r\nbeen more depressing than the poor dinners you had to eat, that is,\r\nall of you who had not great wealth."\r\n\r\n"You would have found none of us disposed to disagree with you on that\r\npoint," I said.\r\n\r\nThe waiter, a fine-looking young fellow, wearing a slightly\r\ndistinctive uniform, now made his appearance. I observed him closely,\r\nas it was the first time I had been able to study particularly the\r\nbearing of one of the enlisted members of the industrial army. This\r\nyoung man, I knew from what I had been told, must be highly educated,\r\nand the equal, socially and in all respects, of those he served. But\r\nit was perfectly evident that to neither side was the situation in the\r\nslightest degree embarrassing. Dr. Leete addressed the young man in a\r\ntone devoid, of course, as any gentleman\'s would be, of\r\nsuperciliousness, but at the same time not in any way deprecatory,\r\nwhile the manner of the young man was simply that of a person intent\r\non discharging correctly the task he was engaged in, equally without\r\nfamiliarity or obsequiousness. It was, in fact, the manner of a\r\nsoldier on duty, but without the military stiffness. As the youth left\r\nthe room, I said, "I cannot get over my wonder at seeing a young man\r\nlike that serving so contentedly in a menial position."\r\n\r\n"What is that word \'menial\'? I never heard it," said Edith.\r\n\r\n"It is obsolete now," remarked her father. "If I understand it\r\nrightly, it applied to persons who performed particularly disagreeable\r\nand unpleasant tasks for others, and carried with it an implication of\r\ncontempt. Was it not so, Mr. West?"\r\n\r\n"That is about it," I said. "Personal service, such as waiting on\r\ntables, was considered menial, and held in such contempt, in my day,\r\nthat persons of culture and refinement would suffer hardship before\r\ncondescending to it."\r\n\r\n"What a strangely artificial idea," exclaimed Mrs. Leete, wonderingly.\r\n\r\n"And yet these services had to be rendered," said Edith.\r\n\r\n"Of course," I replied. "But we imposed them on the poor, and those\r\nwho had no alternative but starvation."\r\n\r\n"And increased the burden you imposed on them by adding your\r\ncontempt," remarked Dr. Leete.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I clearly understand," said Edith. "Do you mean that\r\nyou permitted people to do things for you which you despised them for\r\ndoing, or that you accepted services from them which you would have\r\nbeen unwilling to render them? You can\'t surely mean that, Mr. West?"\r\n\r\nI was obliged to tell her that the fact was just as she had stated.\r\nDr. Leete, however, came to my relief.\r\n\r\n"To understand why Edith is surprised," he said, "you must know that\r\nnowadays it is an axiom of ethics that to accept a service from\r\nanother which we would be unwilling to return in kind, if need were,\r\nis like borrowing with the intention of not repaying, while to enforce\r\nsuch a service by taking advantage of the poverty or necessity of a\r\nperson would be an outrage like forcible robbery. It is the worst\r\nthing about any system which divides men, or allows them to be\r\ndivided, into classes and castes, that it weakens the sense of a\r\ncommon humanity. Unequal distribution of wealth, and, still more\r\neffectually, unequal opportunities of education and culture, divided\r\nsociety in your day into classes which in many respects regarded each\r\nother as distinct races. There is not, after all, such a difference as\r\nmight appear between our ways of looking at this question of service.\r\nLadies and gentlemen of the cultured class in your day would no more\r\nhave permitted persons of their own class to render them services they\r\nwould scorn to return than we would permit anybody to do so. The poor\r\nand the uncultured, however, they looked upon as of another kind from\r\nthemselves. The equal wealth and equal opportunities of culture which\r\nall persons now enjoy have simply made us all members of one class,\r\nwhich corresponds to the most fortunate class with you. Until this\r\nequality of condition had come to pass, the idea of the solidarity of\r\nhumanity, the brother hood of all men, could never have become the\r\nreal conviction and practical principle of action it is nowadays. In\r\nyour day the same phrases were indeed used, but they were phrases\r\nmerely."\r\n\r\n"Do the waiters, also, volunteer?"\r\n\r\n"No," replied Dr. Leete. "The waiters are young men in the\r\nunclassified grade of the industrial army who are assignable to all\r\nsorts of miscellaneous occupations not requiring special skill.\r\nWaiting on table is one of these, and every young recruit is given a\r\ntaste of it. I myself served as a waiter for several months in this\r\nvery dining-house some forty years ago. Once more you must remember\r\nthat there is recognized no sort of difference between the dignity of\r\nthe different sorts of work required by the nation. The individual is\r\nnever regarded, nor regards himself, as the servant of those he\r\nserves, nor is he in any way dependent upon them. It is always the\r\nnation which he is serving. No difference is recognized between a\r\nwaiter\'s functions and those of any other worker. The fact that his is\r\na personal service is indifferent from our point of view. So is a\r\ndoctor\'s. I should as soon expect our waiter to-day to look down on me\r\nbecause I served him as a doctor, as think of looking down on him\r\nbecause he serves me as a waiter."\r\n\r\nAfter dinner my entertainers conducted me about the building, of which\r\nthe extent, the magnificent architecture and richness of\r\nembellishment, astonished me. It seemed that it was not merely a\r\ndining-hall, but likewise a great pleasure-house and social rendezvous\r\nof the quarter, and no appliance of entertainment or recreation seemed\r\nlacking.\r\n\r\n"You find illustrated here," said Dr. Leete, when I had expressed my\r\nadmiration, "what I said to you in our first conversation, when you\r\nwere looking out over the city, as to the splendor of our public and\r\ncommon life as compared with the simplicity of our private and home\r\nlife, and the contrast which, in this respect, the twentieth bears to\r\nthe nineteenth century. To save ourselves useless burdens, we have as\r\nlittle gear about us at home as is consistent with comfort, but the\r\nsocial side of our life is ornate and luxurious beyond anything the\r\nworld ever knew before. All the industrial and professional guilds\r\nhave clubhouses as extensive as this, as well as country, mountain,\r\nand seaside houses for sport and rest in vacations."\r\n\r\n    NOTE. In the latter part of the nineteenth century it became\r\n    a practice of needy young men at some of the colleges of the\r\n    country to earn a little money for their term bills by\r\n    serving as waiters on tables at hotels during the long summer\r\n    vacation. It was claimed, in reply to critics who expressed\r\n    the prejudices of the time in asserting that persons\r\n    voluntarily following such an occupation could not be\r\n    gentlemen, that they were entitled to praise for vindicating,\r\n    by their example, the dignity of all honest and necessary\r\n    labor. The use of this argument illustrates a common\r\n    confusion in thought on the part of my former contemporaries.\r\n    The business of waiting on tables was in no more need of\r\n    defense than most of the other ways of getting a living in\r\n    that day, but to talk of dignity attaching to labor of any\r\n    sort under the system then prevailing was absurd. There is no\r\n    way in which selling labor for the highest price it will\r\n    fetch is more dignified than selling goods for what can be\r\n    got. Both were commercial transactions to be judged by the\r\n    commercial standard. By setting a price in money on his\r\n    service, the worker accepted the money measure for it, and\r\n    renounced all clear claim to be judged by any other. The\r\n    sordid taint which this necessity imparted to the noblest and\r\n    the highest sorts of service was bitterly resented by\r\n    generous souls, but there was no evading it. There was no\r\n    exemption, however transcendent the quality of one\'s service,\r\n    from the necessity of haggling for its price in the\r\n    market-place. The physician must sell his healing and the\r\n    apostle his preaching like the rest. The prophet, who had\r\n    guessed the meaning of God, must dicker for the price of the\r\n    revelation, and the poet hawk his visions in printers\' row.\r\n    If I were asked to name the most distinguishing felicity of\r\n    this age, as compared to that in which I first saw the light,\r\n    I should say that to me it seems to consist in the dignity\r\n    you have given to labor by refusing to set a price upon it\r\n    and abolishing the market-place forever. By requiring of\r\n    every man his best you have made God his task-master, and by\r\n    making honor the sole reward of achievement you have imparted\r\n    to all service the distinction peculiar in my day to the\r\n    soldier\'s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, in the course of our tour of inspection, we came to the library,\r\nwe succumbed to the temptation of the luxurious leather chairs with\r\nwhich it was furnished, and sat down in one of the book-lined alcoves\r\nto rest and chat awhile.[3]\r\n\r\n"Edith tells me that you have been in the library all the morning,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Leete. "Do you know, it seems to me, Mr. West, that you are\r\nthe most enviable of mortals."\r\n\r\n"I should like to know just why," I replied.\r\n\r\n"Because the books of the last hundred years will be new to you," she\r\nanswered. "You will have so much of the most absorbing literature to\r\nread as to leave you scarcely time for meals these five years to come.\r\nAh, what would I give if I had not already read Berrian\'s novels."\r\n\r\n"Or Nesmyth\'s, mamma," added Edith.\r\n\r\n"Yes, or Oates\' poems, or \'Past and Present,\' or, \'In the Beginning,\'\r\nor,--oh, I could name a dozen books, each worth a year of one\'s\r\nlife," declared Mrs. Leete, enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n"I judge, then, that there has been some notable literature produced\r\nin this century."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Dr. Leete. "It has been an era of unexampled intellectual\r\nsplendor. Probably humanity never before passed through a moral and\r\nmaterial evolution, at once so vast in its scope and brief in its time\r\nof accomplishment, as that from the old order to the new in the early\r\npart of this century. When men came to realize the greatness of the\r\nfelicity which had befallen them, and that the change through which\r\nthey had passed was not merely an improvement in details of their\r\ncondition, but the rise of the race to a new plane of existence with\r\nan illimitable vista of progress, their minds were affected in all\r\ntheir faculties with a stimulus, of which the outburst of the mediaeval\r\nrenaissance offers a suggestion but faint indeed. There ensued an era\r\nof mechanical invention, scientific discovery, art, musical and\r\nliterary productiveness to which no previous age of the world offers\r\nanything comparable."\r\n\r\n"By the way," said I, "talking of literature, how are books published\r\nnow? Is that also done by the nation?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\n"But how do you manage it? Does the government publish everything that\r\nis brought it as a matter of course, at the public expense, or does\r\nit exercise a censorship and print only what it approves?"\r\n\r\n"Neither way. The printing department has no censorial powers. It is\r\nbound to print all that is offered it, but prints it only on condition\r\nthat the author defray the first cost out of his credit. He must pay\r\nfor the privilege of the public ear, and if he has any message worth\r\nhearing we consider that he will be glad to do it. Of course, if\r\nincomes were unequal, as in the old times, this rule would enable only\r\nthe rich to be authors, but the resources of citizens being equal, it\r\nmerely measures the strength of the author\'s motive. The cost of an\r\nedition of an average book can be saved out of a year\'s credit by the\r\npractice of economy and some sacrifices. The book, on being published,\r\nis placed on sale by the nation."\r\n\r\n"The author receiving a royalty on the sales as with us, I suppose," I\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n"Not as with you, certainly," replied Dr. Leete, "but nevertheless in\r\none way. The price of every book is made up of the cost of its\r\npublication with a royalty for the author. The author fixes this\r\nroyalty at any figure he pleases. Of course if he puts it unreasonably\r\nhigh it is his own loss, for the book will not sell. The amount of\r\nthis royalty is set to his credit and he is discharged from other\r\nservice to the nation for so long a period as this credit at the rate\r\nof allowance for the support of citizens shall suffice to support him.\r\nIf his book be moderately successful, he has thus a furlough for\r\nseveral months, a year, two or three years, and if he in the mean time\r\nproduces other successful work, the remission of service is extended\r\nso far as the sale of that may justify. An author of much acceptance\r\nsucceeds in supporting himself by his pen during the entire period of\r\nservice, and the degree of any writer\'s literary ability, as\r\ndetermined by the popular voice, is thus the measure of the\r\nopportunity given him to devote his time to literature. In this\r\nrespect the outcome of our system is not very dissimilar to that of\r\nyours, but there are two notable differences. In the first place, the\r\nuniversally high level of education nowadays gives the popular verdict\r\na conclusiveness on the real merit of literary work which in your day\r\nit was as far as possible from having. In the second place, there is\r\nno such thing now as favoritism of any sort to interfere with the\r\nrecognition of true merit. Every author has precisely the same\r\nfacilities for bringing his work before the popular tribunal. To judge\r\nfrom the complaints of the writers of your day, this absolute equality\r\nof opportunity would have been greatly prized."\r\n\r\n"In the recognition of merit in other fields of original genius, such\r\nas music, art, invention, design," I said, "I suppose you follow a\r\nsimilar principle."\r\n\r\n"Yes," he replied, "although the details differ. In art, for example,\r\nas in literature, the people are the sole judges. They vote upon the\r\nacceptance of statues and paintings for the public buildings, and\r\ntheir favorable verdict carries with it the artist\'s remission from\r\nother tasks to devote himself to his vocation. On copies of his work\r\ndisposed of, he also derives the same advantage as the author on sales\r\nof his books. In all these lines of original genius the plan pursued\r\nis the same,--to offer a free field to aspirants, and as soon as\r\nexceptional talent is recognized to release it from all trammels and\r\nlet it have free course. The remission of other service in these cases\r\nis not intended as a gift or reward, but as the means of obtaining\r\nmore and higher service. Of course there are various literary, art,\r\nand scientific institutes to which membership comes to the famous and\r\nis greatly prized. The highest of all honors in the nation, higher\r\nthan the presidency, which calls merely for good sense and devotion to\r\nduty, is the red ribbon awarded by the vote of the people to the great\r\nauthors, artists, engineers, physicians, and inventors of the\r\ngeneration. Not over a certain number wear it at any one time, though\r\nevery bright young fellow in the country loses innumerable nights\'\r\nsleep dreaming of it. I even did myself."\r\n\r\n"Just as if mamma and I would have thought any more of you with it,"\r\nexclaimed Edith; "not that it isn\'t, of course, a very fine thing to\r\nhave."\r\n\r\n"You had no choice, my dear, but to take your father as you found him\r\nand make the best of him," Dr. Leete replied; "but as for your\r\nmother, there, she would never have had me if I had not assured her\r\nthat I was bound to get the red ribbon or at least the blue."\r\n\r\nOn this extravagance Mrs. Leete\'s only comment was a smile.\r\n\r\n"How about periodicals and newspapers?" I said. "I won\'t deny that\r\nyour book publishing system is a considerable improvement on ours,\r\nboth as to its tendency to encourage a real literary vocation, and,\r\nquite as important, to discourage mere scribblers; but I don\'t see how\r\nit can be made to apply to magazines and newspapers. It is very well\r\nto make a man pay for publishing a book, because the expense will be\r\nonly occasional; but no man could afford the expense of publishing a\r\nnewspaper every day in the year. It took the deep pockets of our\r\nprivate capitalists to do that, and often exhausted even them before\r\nthe returns came in. If you have newspapers at all, they must, I\r\nfancy, be published by the government at the public expense, with\r\ngovernment editors, reflecting government opinions. Now, if your\r\nsystem is so perfect that there is never anything to criticise in the\r\nconduct of affairs, this arrangement may answer. Otherwise I should\r\nthink the lack of an independent unofficial medium for the expression\r\nof public opinion would have most unfortunate results. Confess, Dr.\r\nLeete, that a free newspaper press, with all that it implies, was a\r\nredeeming incident of the old system when capital was in private\r\nhands, and that you have to set off the loss of that against your\r\ngains in other respects."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid I can\'t give you even that consolation," replied Dr.\r\nLeete, laughing. "In the first place, Mr. West, the newspaper press is\r\nby no means the only or, as we look at it, the best vehicle for\r\nserious criticism of public affairs. To us, the judgments of your\r\nnewspapers on such themes seem generally to have been crude and\r\nflippant, as well as deeply tinctured with prejudice and bitterness.\r\nIn so far as they may be taken as expressing public opinion, they give\r\nan unfavorable impression of the popular intelligence, while so far as\r\nthey may have formed public opinion, the nation was not to be\r\nfelicitated. Nowadays, when a citizen desires to make a serious\r\nimpression upon the public mind as to any aspect of public affairs, he\r\ncomes out with a book or pamphlet, published as other books are. But\r\nthis is not because we lack newspapers and magazines, or that they\r\nlack the most absolute freedom. The newspaper press is organized so as\r\nto be a more perfect expression of public opinion than it possibly\r\ncould be in your day, when private capital controlled and managed it\r\nprimarily as a money-making business, and secondarily only as a\r\nmouthpiece for the people."\r\n\r\n"But," said I, "if the government prints the papers at the public\r\nexpense, how can it fail to control their policy? Who appoints the\r\neditors, if not the government?"\r\n\r\n"The government does not pay the expense of the papers, nor appoint\r\ntheir editors, nor in any way exert the slightest influence on their\r\npolicy," replied Dr. Leete. "The people who take the paper pay the\r\nexpense of its publication, choose its editor, and remove him when\r\nunsatisfactory. You will scarcely say, I think, that such a newspaper\r\npress is not a free organ of popular opinion."\r\n\r\n"Decidedly I shall not," I replied, "but how is it practicable?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing could be simpler. Supposing some of my neighbors or myself\r\nthink we ought to have a newspaper reflecting our opinions, and\r\ndevoted especially to our locality, trade, or profession. We go about\r\namong the people till we get the names of such a number that their\r\nannual subscriptions will meet the cost of the paper, which is little\r\nor big according to the largeness of its constituency. The amount of\r\nthe subscriptions marked off the credits of the citizens guarantees\r\nthe nation against loss in publishing the paper, its business, you\r\nunderstand, being that of a publisher purely, with no option to refuse\r\nthe duty required. The subscribers to the paper now elect somebody as\r\neditor, who, if he accepts the office, is discharged from other\r\nservice during his incumbency. Instead of paying a salary to him, as\r\nin your day, the subscribers pay the nation an indemnity equal to the\r\ncost of his support for taking him away from the general service. He\r\nmanages the paper just as one of your editors did, except that he has\r\nno counting-room to obey, or interests of private capital as against\r\nthe public good to defend. At the end of the first year, the\r\nsubscribers for the next either reelect the former editor or choose\r\nany one else to his place. An able editor, of course, keeps his place\r\nindefinitely. As the subscription list enlarges, the funds of the\r\npaper increase, and it is improved by the securing of more and better\r\ncontributors, just as your papers were."\r\n\r\n"How is the staff of contributors recompensed, since they cannot be\r\npaid in money."\r\n\r\n"The editor settles with them the price of their wares. The amount is\r\ntransferred to their individual credit from the guarantee credit of\r\nthe paper, and a remission of service is granted the contributor for a\r\nlength of time corresponding to the amount credited him, just as to\r\nother authors. As to magazines, the system is the same. Those\r\ninterested in the prospectus of a new periodical pledge enough\r\nsubscriptions to run it for a year; select their editor, who\r\nrecompenses his contributors just as in the other case, the printing\r\nbureau furnishing the necessary force and material for publication, as\r\na matter of course. When an editor\'s services are no longer desired,\r\nif he cannot earn the right to his time by other literary work, he\r\nsimply resumes his place in the industrial army. I should add that,\r\nthough ordinarily the editor is elected only at the end of the year,\r\nand as a rule is continued in office for a term of years, in case of\r\nany sudden change he should give to the tone of the paper, provision\r\nis made for taking the sense of the subscribers as to his removal at\r\nany time."\r\n\r\n"However earnestly a man may long for leisure for purposes of study or\r\nmeditation," I remarked, "he cannot get out of the harness, if I\r\nunderstand you rightly, except in these two ways you have mentioned.\r\nHe must either by literary, artistic, or inventive productiveness\r\nindemnify the nation for the loss of his services, or must get a\r\nsufficient number of other people to contribute to such an indemnity."\r\n\r\n"It is most certain," replied Dr. Leete, "that no able-bodied man\r\nnowadays can evade his share of work and live on the toil of others,\r\nwhether he calls himself by the fine name of student or confesses to\r\nbeing simply lazy. At the same time our system is elastic enough to\r\ngive free play to every instinct of human nature which does not aim at\r\ndominating others or living on the fruit of others\' labor. There is\r\nnot only the remission by indemnification but the remission by\r\nabnegation. Any man in his thirty-third year, his term of service\r\nbeing then half done, can obtain an honorable discharge from the army,\r\nprovided he accepts for the rest of his life one half the rate of\r\nmaintenance other citizens receive. It is quite possible to live on\r\nthis amount, though one must forego the luxuries and elegancies of\r\nlife, with some, perhaps, of its comforts."\r\n\r\nWhen the ladies retired that evening, Edith brought me a book and\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n"If you should be wakeful to-night, Mr. West, you might be interested\r\nin looking over this story by Berrian. It is considered his\r\nmasterpiece, and will at least give you an idea what the stories\r\nnowadays are like."\r\n\r\nI sat up in my room that night reading "Penthesilia" till it grew gray\r\nin the east, and did not lay it down till I had finished it. And yet\r\nlet no admirer of the great romancer of the twentieth century resent\r\nmy saying that at the first reading what most impressed me was not so\r\nmuch what was in the book as what was left out of it. The\r\nstory-writers of my day would have deemed the making of bricks without\r\nstraw a light task compared with the construction of a romance from\r\nwhich should be excluded all effects drawn from the contrasts of\r\nwealth and poverty, education and ignorance, coarseness and\r\nrefinement, high and low, all motives drawn from social pride and\r\nambition, the desire of being richer or the fear of being poorer,\r\ntogether with sordid anxieties of any sort for one\'s self or others; a\r\nromance in which there should, indeed, be love galore, but love\r\nunfretted by artificial barriers created by differences of station or\r\npossessions, owning no other law but that of the heart. The reading of\r\n"Penthesilia" was of more value than almost any amount of explanation\r\nwould have been in giving me something like a general impression of\r\nthe social aspect of the twentieth century. The information Dr. Leete\r\nhad imparted was indeed extensive as to facts, but they had affected\r\nmy mind as so many separate impressions, which I had as yet succeeded\r\nbut imperfectly in making cohere. Berrian put them together for me in\r\na picture.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: I cannot sufficiently celebrate the glorious liberty that\r\nreigns in the public libraries of the twentieth century as compared\r\nwith the intolerable management of those of the nineteenth century, in\r\nwhich the books were jealously railed away from the people, and\r\nobtainable only at an expenditure of time and red tape calculated to\r\ndiscourage any ordinary taste for literature.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning I rose somewhat before the breakfast hour. As I descended\r\nthe stairs, Edith stepped into the hall from the room which had been\r\nthe scene of the morning interview between us described some chapters\r\nback.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" she exclaimed, with a charmingly arch expression, "you thought\r\nto slip out unbeknown for another of those solitary morning rambles\r\nwhich have such nice effects on you. But you see I am up too early for\r\nyou this time. You are fairly caught."\r\n\r\n"You discredit the efficacy of your own cure," I said, "by supposing\r\nthat such a ramble would now be attended with bad consequences."\r\n\r\n"I am very glad to hear that," she said. "I was in here arranging some\r\nflowers for the breakfast table when I heard you come down, and\r\nfancied I detected something surreptitious in your step on the\r\nstairs."\r\n\r\n"You did me injustice," I replied. "I had no idea of going out at\r\nall."\r\n\r\nDespite her effort to convey an impression that my interception was\r\npurely accidental, I had at the time a dim suspicion of what I\r\nafterwards learned to be the fact, namely, that this sweet creature,\r\nin pursuance of her self-assumed guardianship over me, had risen for\r\nthe last two or three mornings at an unheard-of hour, to insure\r\nagainst the possibility of my wandering off alone in case I should be\r\naffected as on the former occasion. Receiving permission to assist her\r\nin making up the breakfast bouquet, I followed her into the room from\r\nwhich she had emerged.\r\n\r\n"Are you sure," she asked, "that you are quite done with those\r\nterrible sensations you had that morning?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say that I do not have times of feeling decidedly queer," I\r\nreplied, "moments when my personal identity seems an open question. It\r\nwould be too much to expect after my experience that I should not have\r\nsuch sensations occasionally, but as for being carried entirely off my\r\nfeet, as I was on the point of being that morning, I think the danger\r\nis past."\r\n\r\n"I shall never forget how you looked that morning," she said.\r\n\r\n"If you had merely saved my life," I continued, "I might, perhaps,\r\nfind words to express my gratitude, but it was my reason you saved,\r\nand there are no words that would not belittle my debt to you." I\r\nspoke with emotion, and her eyes grew suddenly moist.\r\n\r\n"It is too much to believe all this," she said, "but it is very\r\ndelightful to hear you say it. What I did was very little. I was very\r\nmuch distressed for you, I know. Father never thinks anything ought to\r\nastonish us when it can be explained scientifically, as I suppose this\r\nlong sleep of yours can be, but even to fancy myself in your place\r\nmakes my head swim. I know that I could not have borne it at all."\r\n\r\n"That would depend," I replied, "on whether an angel came to support\r\nyou with her sympathy in the crisis of your condition, as one came to\r\nme." If my face at all expressed the feelings I had a right to have\r\ntoward this sweet and lovely young girl, who had played so angelic a\r\nrole toward me, its expression must have been very worshipful just\r\nthen. The expression or the words, or both together, caused her now to\r\ndrop her eyes with a charming blush.\r\n\r\n"For the matter of that," I said, "if your experience has not been as\r\nstartling as mine, it must have been rather overwhelming to see a man\r\nbelonging to a strange century, and apparently a hundred years dead,\r\nraised to life."\r\n\r\n"It seemed indeed strange beyond any describing at first," she said,\r\n"but when we began to put ourselves in your place, and realize how\r\nmuch stranger it must seem to you, I fancy we forgot our own feelings\r\na good deal, at least I know I did. It seemed then not so much\r\nastounding as interesting and touching beyond anything ever heard of\r\nbefore."\r\n\r\n"But does it not come over you as astounding to sit at table with me,\r\nseeing who I am?"\r\n\r\n"You must remember that you do not seem so strange to us as we must to\r\nyou," she answered. "We belong to a future of which you could not form\r\nan idea, a generation of which you knew nothing until you saw us. But\r\nyou belong to a generation of which our forefathers were a part. We\r\nknow all about it; the names of many of its members are household\r\nwords with us. We have made a study of your ways of living and\r\nthinking; nothing you say or do surprises us, while we say and do\r\nnothing which does not seem strange to you. So you see, Mr. West, that\r\nif you feel that you can, in time, get accustomed to us, you must not\r\nbe surprised that from the first we have scarcely found you strange at\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"I had not thought of it in that way," I replied. "There is indeed\r\nmuch in what you say. One can look back a thousand years easier than\r\nforward fifty. A century is not so very long a retrospect. I might\r\nhave known your great-grand-parents. Possibly I did. Did they live in\r\nBoston?"\r\n\r\n"I believe so."\r\n\r\n"You are not sure, then?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she replied. "Now I think, they did."\r\n\r\n"I had a very large circle of acquaintances in the city," I said. "It\r\nis not unlikely that I knew or knew of some of them. Perhaps I may\r\nhave known them well. Wouldn\'t it be interesting if I should chance\r\nto be able to tell you all about your great-grandfather, for\r\ninstance?"\r\n\r\n"Very interesting."\r\n\r\n"Do you know your genealogy well enough to tell me who your forbears\r\nwere in the Boston of my day?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, then, you will some time tell me what some of their names\r\nwere."\r\n\r\nShe was engrossed in arranging a troublesome spray of green, and did\r\nnot reply at once. Steps upon the stairway indicated that the other\r\nmembers of the family were descending.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, some time," she said.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, Dr. Leete suggested taking me to inspect the central\r\nwarehouse and observe actually in operation the machinery of\r\ndistribution, which Edith had described to me. As we walked away from\r\nthe house I said, "It is now several days that I have been living in\r\nyour household on a most extraordinary footing, or rather on none at\r\nall. I have not spoken of this aspect of my position before because\r\nthere were so many other aspects yet more extraordinary. But now that\r\nI am beginning a little to feel my feet under me, and to realize that,\r\nhowever I came here, I am here, and must make the best of it, I must\r\nspeak to you on this point."\r\n\r\n"As for your being a guest in my house," replied Dr. Leete, "I pray\r\nyou not to begin to be uneasy on that point, for I mean to keep you a\r\nlong time yet. With all your modesty, you can but realize that such a\r\nguest as yourself is an acquisition not willingly to be parted with."\r\n\r\n"Thanks, doctor," I said. "It would be absurd, certainly, for me to\r\naffect any oversensitiveness about accepting the temporary hospitality\r\nof one to whom I owe it that I am not still awaiting the end of the\r\nworld in a living tomb. But if I am to be a permanent citizen of this\r\ncentury I must have some standing in it. Now, in my time a person more\r\nor less entering the world, however he got in, would not be noticed in\r\nthe unorganized throng of men, and might make a place for himself\r\nanywhere he chose if he were strong enough. But nowadays everybody is\r\na part of a system with a distinct place and function. I am outside\r\nthe system, and don\'t see how I can get in; there seems no way to get\r\nin, except to be born in or to come in as an emigrant from some other\r\nsystem."\r\n\r\nDr. Leete laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n"I admit," he said, "that our system is defective in lacking provision\r\nfor cases like yours, but you see nobody anticipated additions to the\r\nworld except by the usual process. You need, however, have no fear\r\nthat we shall be unable to provide both a place and occupation for you\r\nin due time. You have as yet been brought in contact only with the\r\nmembers of my family, but you must not suppose that I have kept your\r\nsecret. On the contrary, your case, even before your resuscitation,\r\nand vastly more since, has excited the profoundest interest in the\r\nnation. In view of your precarious nervous condition, it was thought\r\nbest that I should take exclusive charge of you at first, and that you\r\nshould, through me and my family, receive some general idea of the\r\nsort of world you had come back to before you began to make the\r\nacquaintance generally of its inhabitants. As to finding a function\r\nfor you in society, there was no hesitation as to what that would be.\r\nFew of us have it in our power to confer so great a service on the\r\nnation as you will be able to when you leave my roof, which, however,\r\nyou must not think of doing for a good time yet."\r\n\r\n"What can I possibly do?" I asked. "Perhaps you imagine I have some\r\ntrade, or art, or special skill. I assure you I have none whatever. I\r\nnever earned a dollar in my life, or did an hour\'s work. I am strong,\r\nand might be a common laborer, but nothing more."\r\n\r\n"If that were the most efficient service you were able to render the\r\nnation, you would find that avocation considered quite as respectable\r\nas any other," replied Dr. Leete; "but you can do something else\r\nbetter. You are easily the master of all our historians on questions\r\nrelating to the social condition of the latter part of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, to us one of the most absorbingly interesting periods of\r\nhistory; and whenever in due time you have sufficiently familiarized\r\nyourself with our institutions, and are willing to teach us something\r\nconcerning those of your day, you will find an historical lectureship\r\nin one of our colleges awaiting you."\r\n\r\n"Very good! very good indeed," I said, much relieved by so practical a\r\nsuggestion on a point which had begun to trouble me. "If your people\r\nare really so much interested in the nineteenth century, there will\r\nindeed be an occupation ready-made for me. I don\'t think there is\r\nanything else that I could possibly earn my salt at, but I certainly\r\nmay claim without conceit to have some special qualifications for such\r\na post as you describe."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nI found the processes at the warehouse quite as interesting as Edith\r\nhad described them, and became even enthusiastic over the truly\r\nremarkable illustration which is seen there of the prodigiously\r\nmultiplied efficiency which perfect organization can give to labor. It\r\nis like a gigantic mill, into the hopper of which goods are being\r\nconstantly poured by the train-load and ship-load, to issue at the\r\nother end in packages of pounds and ounces, yards and inches, pints\r\nand gallons, corresponding to the infinitely complex personal needs of\r\nhalf a million people. Dr. Leete, with the assistance of data\r\nfurnished by me as to the way goods were sold in my day, figured out\r\nsome astounding results in the way of the economies effected by the\r\nmodern system.\r\n\r\nAs we set out homeward, I said: "After what I have seen to-day,\r\ntogether with what you have told me, and what I learned under Miss\r\nLeete\'s tutelage at the sample store, I have a tolerably clear idea of\r\nyour system of distribution, and how it enables you to dispense with a\r\ncirculating medium. But I should like very much to know something more\r\nabout your system of production. You have told me in general how your\r\nindustrial army is levied and organized, but who directs its efforts?\r\nWhat supreme authority determines what shall be done in every\r\ndepartment, so that enough of everything is produced and yet no labor\r\nwasted? It seems to me that this must be a wonderfully complex and\r\ndifficult function, requiring very unusual endowments."\r\n\r\n"Does it indeed seem so to you?" responded Dr. Leete. "I assure you\r\nthat it is nothing of the kind, but on the other hand so simple, and\r\ndepending on principles so obvious and easily applied, that the\r\nfunctionaries at Washington to whom it is trusted require to be\r\nnothing more than men of fair abilities to discharge it to the entire\r\nsatisfaction of the nation. The machine which they direct is indeed a\r\nvast one, but so logical in its principles and direct and simple in\r\nits workings, that it all but runs itself; and nobody but a fool could\r\nderange it, as I think you will agree after a few words of\r\nexplanation. Since you already have a pretty good idea of the working\r\nof the distributive system, let us begin at that end. Even in your day\r\nstatisticians were able to tell you the number of yards of cotton,\r\nvelvet, woolen, the number of barrels of flour, potatoes, butter,\r\nnumber of pairs of shoes, hats, and umbrellas annually consumed by the\r\nnation. Owing to the fact that production was in private hands, and\r\nthat there was no way of getting statistics of actual distribution,\r\nthese figures were not exact, but they were nearly so. Now that every\r\npin which is given out from a national warehouse is recorded, of\r\ncourse the figures of consumption for any week, month, or year, in the\r\npossession of the department of distribution at the end of that\r\nperiod, are precise. On these figures, allowing for tendencies to\r\nincrease or decrease and for any special causes likely to affect\r\ndemand, the estimates, say for a year ahead, are based. These\r\nestimates, with a proper margin for security, having been accepted by\r\nthe general administration, the responsibility of the distributive\r\ndepartment ceases until the goods are delivered to it. I speak of the\r\nestimates being furnished for an entire year ahead, but in reality\r\nthey cover that much time only in case of the great staples for which\r\nthe demand can be calculated on as steady. In the great majority of\r\nsmaller industries for the product of which popular taste fluctuates,\r\nand novelty is frequently required, production is kept barely ahead of\r\nconsumption, the distributive department furnishing frequent estimates\r\nbased on the weekly state of demand.\r\n\r\n"Now the entire field of productive and constructive industry is\r\ndivided into ten great departments, each representing a group of\r\nallied industries, each particular industry being in turn represented\r\nby a subordinate bureau, which has a complete record of the plant and\r\nforce under its control, of the present product, and means of\r\nincreasing it. The estimates of the distributive department, after\r\nadoption by the administration, are sent as mandates to the ten great\r\ndepartments, which allot them to the subordinate bureaus representing\r\nthe particular industries, and these set the men at work. Each bureau\r\nis responsible for the task given it, and this responsibility is\r\nenforced by departmental oversight and that of the administration; nor\r\ndoes the distributive department accept the product without its own\r\ninspection; while even if in the hands of the consumer an article\r\nturns out unfit, the system enables the fault to be traced back to the\r\noriginal workman. The production of the commodities for actual public\r\nconsumption does not, of course, require by any means all the national\r\nforce of workers. After the necessary contingents have been detailed\r\nfor the various industries, the amount of labor left for other\r\nemployment is expended in creating fixed capital, such as buildings,\r\nmachinery, engineering works, and so forth."\r\n\r\n"One point occurs to me," I said, "on which I should think there might\r\nbe dissatisfaction. Where there is no opportunity for private\r\nenterprise, how is there any assurance that the claims of small\r\nminorities of the people to have articles produced, for which there is\r\nno wide demand, will be respected? An official decree at any moment\r\nmay deprive them of the means of gratifying some special taste, merely\r\nbecause the majority does not share it."\r\n\r\n"That would be tyranny indeed," replied Dr. Leete, "and you may be\r\nvery sure that it does not happen with us, to whom liberty is as dear\r\nas equality or fraternity. As you come to know our system better, you\r\nwill see that our officials are in fact, and not merely in name, the\r\nagents and servants of the people. The administration has no power to\r\nstop the production of any commodity for which there continues to be a\r\ndemand. Suppose the demand for any article declines to such a point\r\nthat its production becomes very costly. The price has to be raised in\r\nproportion, of course, but as long as the consumer cares to pay it,\r\nthe production goes on. Again, suppose an article not before produced\r\nis demanded. If the administration doubts the reality of the demand, a\r\npopular petition guaranteeing a certain basis of consumption compels\r\nit to produce the desired article. A government, or a majority, which\r\nshould undertake to tell the people, or a minority, what they were to\r\neat, drink, or wear, as I believe governments in America did in your\r\nday, would be regarded as a curious anachronism indeed. Possibly you\r\nhad reasons for tolerating these infringements of personal\r\nindependence, but we should not think them endurable. I am glad you\r\nraised this point, for it has given me a chance to show you how much\r\nmore direct and efficient is the control over production exercised by\r\nthe individual citizen now than it was in your day, when what you\r\ncalled private initiative prevailed, though it should have been\r\ncalled capitalist initiative, for the average private citizen had\r\nlittle enough share in it."\r\n\r\n"You speak of raising the price of costly articles," I said. "How can\r\nprices be regulated in a country where there is no competition between\r\nbuyers or sellers?"\r\n\r\n"Just as they were with you," replied Dr. Leete. "You think that needs\r\nexplaining," he added, as I looked incredulous, "but the explanation\r\nneed not be long; the cost of the labor which produced it was\r\nrecognized as the legitimate basis of the price of an article in your\r\nday, and so it is in ours. In your day, it was the difference in wages\r\nthat made the difference in the cost of labor; now it is the relative\r\nnumber of hours constituting a day\'s work in different trades, the\r\nmaintenance of the worker being equal in all cases. The cost of a\r\nman\'s work in a trade so difficult that in order to attract volunteers\r\nthe hours have to be fixed at four a day is twice as great as that in\r\na trade where the men work eight hours. The result as to the cost of\r\nlabor, you see, is just the same as if the man working four hours were\r\npaid, under your system, twice the wages the other gets. This\r\ncalculation applied to the labor employed in the various processes of\r\na manufactured article gives its price relatively to other articles.\r\nBesides the cost of production and transportation, the factor of\r\nscarcity affects the prices of some commodities. As regards the great\r\nstaples of life, of which an abundance can always be secured,\r\nscarcity is eliminated as a factor. There is always a large surplus\r\nkept on hand from which any fluctuations of demand or supply can be\r\ncorrected, even in most cases of bad crops. The prices of the staples\r\ngrow less year by year, but rarely, if ever, rise. There are, however,\r\ncertain classes of articles permanently, and others temporarily,\r\nunequal to the demand, as, for example, fresh fish or dairy products\r\nin the latter category, and the products of high skill and rare\r\nmaterials in the other. All that can be done here is to equalize the\r\ninconvenience of the scarcity. This is done by temporarily raising the\r\nprice if the scarcity be temporary, or fixing it high if it be\r\npermanent. High prices in your day meant restriction of the articles\r\naffected to the rich, but nowadays, when the means of all are the\r\nsame, the effect is only that those to whom the articles seem most\r\ndesirable are the ones who purchase them. Of course the nation, as any\r\nother caterer for the public needs must be, is frequently left with\r\nsmall lots of goods on its hands by changes in taste, unseasonable\r\nweather, and various other causes. These it has to dispose of at a\r\nsacrifice just as merchants often did in your day, charging up the\r\nloss to the expenses of the business. Owing, however, to the vast body\r\nof consumers to which such lots can be simultaneously offered, there\r\nis rarely any difficulty in getting rid of them at trifling loss. I\r\nhave given you now some general notion of our system of production,\r\nas well as distribution. Do you find it as complex as you expected?"\r\n\r\nI admitted that nothing could be much simpler.\r\n\r\n"I am sure," said Dr. Leete, "that it is within the truth to say that\r\nthe head of one of the myriad private businesses of your day, who had\r\nto maintain sleepless vigilance against the fluctuations of the\r\nmarket, the machinations of his rivals, and the failure of his\r\ndebtors, had a far more trying task than the group of men at\r\nWashington who nowadays direct the industries of the entire nation.\r\nAll this merely shows, my dear fellow, how much easier it is to do\r\nthings the right way than the wrong. It is easier for a general up in\r\na balloon, with perfect survey of the field, to manoeuvre a million men\r\nto victory than for a sergeant to manage a platoon in a thicket."\r\n\r\n"The general of this army, including the flower of the manhood of the\r\nnation, must be the foremost man in the country, really greater even\r\nthan the President of the United States," I said.\r\n\r\n"He is the President of the United States," replied Dr. Leete, "or\r\nrather the most important function of the presidency is the headship\r\nof the industrial army."\r\n\r\n"How is he chosen?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"I explained to you before," replied Dr. Leete, "when I was describing\r\nthe force of the motive of emulation among all grades of the\r\nindustrial army, that the line of promotion for the meritorious lies\r\nthrough three grades to the officer\'s grade, and thence up through the\r\nlieutenancies to the captaincy or foremanship, and superintendency or\r\ncolonel\'s rank. Next, with an intervening grade in some of the larger\r\ntrades, come the general of the guild, under whose immediate control\r\nall the operations of the trade are conducted. This officer is at the\r\nhead of the national bureau representing his trade, and is responsible\r\nfor its work to the administration. The general of his guild holds a\r\nsplendid position, and one which amply satisfies the ambition of most\r\nmen, but above his rank, which may be compared--to follow the military\r\nanalogies familiar to you--to that of a general of division or\r\nmajor-general, is that of the chiefs of the ten great departments, or\r\ngroups of allied trades. The chiefs of these ten grand divisions of\r\nthe industrial army may be compared to your commanders of army corps,\r\nor lieutenant-generals, each having from a dozen to a score of\r\ngenerals of separate guilds reporting to him. Above these ten great\r\nofficers, who form his council, is the general-in-chief, who is the\r\nPresident of the United States.\r\n\r\n"The general-in-chief of the industrial army must have passed through\r\nall the grades below him, from the common laborers up. Let us see how\r\nhe rises. As I have told you, it is simply by the excellence of his\r\nrecord as a worker that one rises through the grades of the privates\r\nand becomes a candidate for a lieutenancy. Through the lieutenancies\r\nhe rises to the colonelcy, or superintendent\'s position, by\r\nappointment from above, strictly limited to the candidates of the best\r\nrecords. The general of the guild appoints to the ranks under him, but\r\nhe himself is not appointed, but chosen by suffrage."\r\n\r\n"By suffrage!" I exclaimed. "Is not that ruinous to the discipline of\r\nthe guild, by tempting the candidates to intrigue for the support of\r\nthe workers under them?"\r\n\r\n"So it would be, no doubt," replied Dr. Leete, "if the workers had any\r\nsuffrage to exercise, or anything to say about the choice. But they\r\nhave nothing. Just here comes in a peculiarity of our system. The\r\ngeneral of the guild is chosen from among the superintendents by vote\r\nof the honorary members of the guild, that is, of those who have\r\nserved their time in the guild and received their discharge. As you\r\nknow, at the age of forty-five we are mustered out of the army of\r\nindustry, and have the residue of life for the pursuit of our own\r\nimprovement or recreation. Of course, however, the associations of our\r\nactive lifetime retain a powerful hold on us. The companionships we\r\nformed then remain our companionships till the end of life. We always\r\ncontinue honorary members of our former guilds, and retain the keenest\r\nand most jealous interest in their welfare and repute in the hands of\r\nthe following generation. In the clubs maintained by the honorary\r\nmembers of the several guilds, in which we meet socially, there are no\r\ntopics of conversation so common as those which relate to these\r\nmatters, and the young aspirants for guild leadership who can pass the\r\ncriticism of us old fellows are likely to be pretty well equipped.\r\nRecognizing this fact, the nation entrusts to the honorary members of\r\neach guild the election of its general, and I venture to claim that no\r\nprevious form of society could have developed a body of electors so\r\nideally adapted to their office, as regards absolute impartiality,\r\nknowledge of the special qualifications and record of candidates,\r\nsolicitude for the best result, and complete absence of self-interest.\r\n\r\n"Each of the ten lieutenant-generals or heads of departments is\r\nhimself elected from among the generals of the guilds grouped as a\r\ndepartment, by vote of the honorary members of the guilds thus\r\ngrouped. Of course there is a tendency on the part of each guild to\r\nvote for its own general, but no guild of any group has nearly enough\r\nvotes to elect a man not supported by most of the others. I assure you\r\nthat these elections are exceedingly lively."\r\n\r\n"The President, I suppose, is selected from among the ten heads of the\r\ngreat departments," I suggested.\r\n\r\n"Precisely, but the heads of departments are not eligible to the\r\npresidency till they have been a certain number of years out of\r\noffice. It is rarely that a man passes through all the grades to the\r\nheadship of a department much before he is forty, and at the end of a\r\nfive years\' term he is usually forty-five. If more, he still serves\r\nthrough his term, and if less, he is nevertheless discharged from the\r\nindustrial army at its termination. It would not do for him to return\r\nto the ranks. The interval before he is a candidate for the presidency\r\nis intended to give time for him to recognize fully that he has\r\nreturned into the general mass of the nation, and is identified with\r\nit rather than with the industrial army. Moreover, it is expected that\r\nhe will employ this period in studying the general condition of the\r\narmy, instead of that of the special group of guilds of which he was\r\nthe head. From among the former heads of departments who may be\r\neligible at the time, the President is elected by vote of all the men\r\nof the nation who are not connected with the industrial army."\r\n\r\n"The army is not allowed to vote for President?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. That would be perilous to its discipline, which it is\r\nthe business of the President to maintain as the representative of the\r\nnation at large. His right hand for this purpose is the inspectorate,\r\na highly important department of our system; to the inspectorate come\r\nall complaints or information as to defects in goods, insolence or\r\ninefficiency of officials, or dereliction of any sort in the public\r\nservice. The inspectorate, however, does not wait for complaints. Not\r\nonly is it on the alert to catch and sift every rumor of a fault in\r\nthe service, but it is its business, by systematic and constant\r\noversight and inspection of every branch of the army, to find out what\r\nis going wrong before anybody else does. The President is usually not\r\nfar from fifty when elected, and serves five years, forming an\r\nhonorable exception to the rule of retirement at forty-five. At the\r\nend of his term of office, a national Congress is called to receive\r\nhis report and approve or condemn it. If it is approved, Congress\r\nusually elects him to represent the nation for five years more in the\r\ninternational council. Congress, I should also say, passes on the\r\nreports of the outgoing heads of departments, and a disapproval\r\nrenders any one of them ineligible for President. But it is rare,\r\nindeed, that the nation has occasion for other sentiments than those\r\nof gratitude toward its high officers. As to their ability, to have\r\nrisen from the ranks, by tests so various and severe, to their\r\npositions, is proof in itself of extraordinary qualities, while as to\r\nfaithfulness, our social system leaves them absolutely without any\r\nother motive than that of winning the esteem of their fellow citizens.\r\nCorruption is impossible in a society where there is neither poverty\r\nto be bribed nor wealth to bribe, while as to demagoguery or intrigue\r\nfor office, the conditions of promotion render them out of the\r\nquestion."\r\n\r\n"One point I do not quite understand," I said. "Are the members of the\r\nliberal professions eligible to the presidency? and if so, how are\r\nthey ranked with those who pursue the industries proper?"\r\n\r\n"They have no ranking with them," replied Dr. Leete. "The members of\r\nthe technical professions, such as engineers and architects, have a\r\nranking with the constructive guilds; but the members of the liberal\r\nprofessions, the doctors and teachers, as well as the artists and men\r\nof letters who obtain remissions of industrial service, do not belong\r\nto the industrial army. On this ground they vote for the President,\r\nbut are not eligible to his office. One of its main duties being the\r\ncontrol and discipline of the industrial army, it is essential that\r\nthe President should have passed through all its grades to understand\r\nhis business."\r\n\r\n"That is reasonable," I said; "but if the doctors and teachers do not\r\nknow enough of industry to be President, neither, I should think, can\r\nthe President know enough of medicine and education to control those\r\ndepartments."\r\n\r\n"No more does he," was the reply. "Except in the general way that he\r\nis responsible for the enforcement of the laws as to all classes, the\r\nPresident has nothing to do with the faculties of medicine and\r\neducation, which are controlled by boards of regents of their own, in\r\nwhich the President is ex-officio chairman, and has the casting vote.\r\nThese regents, who, of course, are responsible to Congress, are chosen\r\nby the honorary members of the guilds of education and medicine, the\r\nretired teachers and doctors of the country."\r\n\r\n"Do you know," I said, "the method of electing officials by votes of\r\nthe retired members of the guilds is nothing more than the application\r\non a national scale of the plan of government by alumni, which we used\r\nto a slight extent occasionally in the management of our higher\r\neducational institutions."\r\n\r\n"Did you, indeed?" exclaimed Dr. Leete, with animation. "That is quite\r\nnew to me, and I fancy will be to most of us, and of much interest as\r\nwell. There has been great discussion as to the germ of the idea, and\r\nwe fancied that there was for once something new under the sun. Well!\r\nwell! In your higher educational institutions! that is interesting\r\nindeed. You must tell me more of that."\r\n\r\n"Truly, there is very little more to tell than I have told already," I\r\nreplied. "If we had the germ of your idea, it was but as a germ."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening I sat up for some time after the ladies had retired,\r\ntalking with Dr. Leete about the effect of the plan of exempting men\r\nfrom further service to the nation after the age of forty-five, a\r\npoint brought up by his account of the part taken by the retired\r\ncitizens in the government.\r\n\r\n"At forty-five," said I, "a man still has ten years of good manual\r\nlabor in him, and twice ten years of good intellectual service. To be\r\nsuperannuated at that age and laid on the shelf must be regarded\r\nrather as a hardship than a favor by men of energetic dispositions."\r\n\r\n"My dear Mr. West," exclaimed Dr. Leete, beaming upon me, "you cannot\r\nhave any idea of the piquancy your nineteenth century ideas have for\r\nus of this day, the rare quaintness of their effect. Know, O child of\r\nanother race and yet the same, that the labor we have to render as our\r\npart in securing for the nation the means of a comfortable physical\r\nexistence is by no means regarded as the most important, the most\r\ninteresting, or the most dignified employment of our powers. We look\r\nupon it as a necessary duty to be discharged before we can fully\r\ndevote ourselves to the higher exercise of our faculties, the\r\nintellectual and spiritual enjoyments and pursuits which alone mean\r\nlife. Everything possible is indeed done by the just distribution of\r\nburdens, and by all manner of special attractions and incentives to\r\nrelieve our labor of irksomeness, and, except in a comparative sense,\r\nit is not usually irksome, and is often inspiring. But it is not our\r\nlabor, but the higher and larger activities which the performance of\r\nour task will leave us free to enter upon, that are considered the\r\nmain business of existence.\r\n\r\n"Of course not all, nor the majority, have those scientific, artistic,\r\nliterary, or scholarly interests which make leisure the one thing\r\nvaluable to their possessors. Many look upon the last half of life\r\nchiefly as a period for enjoyment of other sorts; for travel, for\r\nsocial relaxation in the company of their lifetime friends; a time\r\nfor the cultivation of all manner of personal idiosyncrasies and\r\nspecial tastes, and the pursuit of every imaginable form of\r\nrecreation; in a word, a time for the leisurely and unperturbed\r\nappreciation of the good things of the world which they have helped to\r\ncreate. But whatever the differences between our individual tastes as\r\nto the use we shall put our leisure to, we all agree in looking\r\nforward to the date of our discharge as the time when we shall first\r\nenter upon the full enjoyment of our birthright, the period when we\r\nshall first really attain our majority and become enfranchised from\r\ndiscipline and control, with the fee of our lives vested in\r\nourselves. As eager boys in your day anticipated twenty-one, so men\r\nnowadays look forward to forty-five. At twenty-one we become men, but\r\nat forty-five we renew youth. Middle age and what you would have\r\ncalled old age are considered, rather than youth, the enviable time of\r\nlife. Thanks to the better conditions of existence nowadays, and above\r\nall the freedom of every one from care, old age approaches many years\r\nlater and has an aspect far more benign than in past times. Persons of\r\naverage constitution usually live to eighty-five or ninety, and at\r\nforty-five we are physically and mentally younger, I fancy, than you\r\nwere at thirty-five. It is a strange reflection that at forty-five,\r\nwhen we are just entering upon the most enjoyable period of life, you\r\nalready began to think of growing old and to look backward. With you\r\nit was the forenoon, with us it is the afternoon, which is the\r\nbrighter half of life."\r\n\r\nAfter this I remember that our talk branched into the subject of\r\npopular sports and recreations at the present time as compared with\r\nthose of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n"In one respect," said Dr. Leete, "there is a marked difference. The\r\nprofessional sportsmen, which were such a curious feature of your day,\r\nwe have nothing answering to, nor are the prizes for which our\r\nathletes contend money prizes, as with you. Our contests are always\r\nfor glory only. The generous rivalry existing between the various\r\nguilds, and the loyalty of each worker to his own, afford a constant\r\nstimulation to all sorts of games and matches by sea and land, in\r\nwhich the young men take scarcely more interest than the honorary\r\nguildsmen who have served their time. The guild yacht races off\r\nMarblehead take place next week, and you will be able to judge for\r\nyourself of the popular enthusiasm which such events nowadays call out\r\nas compared with your day. The demand for \'_panem et circenses_\'\r\npreferred by the Roman populace is recognized nowadays as a wholly\r\nreasonable one. If bread is the first necessity of life, recreation is\r\na close second, and the nation caters for both. Americans of the\r\nnineteenth century were as unfortunate in lacking an adequate\r\nprovision for the one sort of need as for the other. Even if the\r\npeople of that period had enjoyed larger leisure they would, I fancy,\r\nhave often been at a loss how to pass it agreeably. We are never in\r\nthat predicament."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of an early morning constitutional I visited\r\nCharlestown. Among the changes, too numerous to attempt to indicate,\r\nwhich mark the lapse of a century in that quarter, I particularly\r\nnoted the total disappearance of the old state prison.\r\n\r\n"That went before my day, but I remember hearing about it," said Dr.\r\nLeete, when I alluded to the fact at the breakfast table. "We have no\r\njails nowadays. All cases of atavism are treated in the hospitals."\r\n\r\n"Of atavism!" I exclaimed, staring.\r\n\r\n"Why, yes," replied Dr. Leete. "The idea of dealing punitively with\r\nthose unfortunates was given up at least fifty years ago, and I think\r\nmore."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t quite understand you," I said. "Atavism in my day was a word\r\napplied to the cases of persons in whom some trait of a remote\r\nancestor recurred in a noticeable manner. Am I to understand that\r\ncrime is nowadays looked upon as the recurrence of an ancestral\r\ntrait?"\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon," said Dr. Leete with a smile half humorous, half\r\ndeprecating, "but since you have so explicitly asked the question, I\r\nam forced to say that the fact is precisely that."\r\n\r\nAfter what I had already learned of the moral contrasts between the\r\nnineteenth and the twentieth centuries, it was doubtless absurd in me\r\nto begin to develop sensitiveness on the subject, and probably if Dr.\r\nLeete had not spoken with that apologetic air and Mrs. Leete and Edith\r\nshown a corresponding embarrassment, I should not have flushed, as I\r\nwas conscious I did.\r\n\r\n"I was not in much danger of being vain of my generation before," I\r\nsaid; "but, really"--\r\n\r\n"This is your generation, Mr. West," interposed Edith. "It is the one\r\nin which you are living, you know, and it is only because we are alive\r\nnow that we call it ours."\r\n\r\n"Thank you. I will try to think of it so," I said, and as my eyes met\r\nhers their expression quite cured my senseless sensitiveness. "After\r\nall," I said, with a laugh, "I was brought up a Calvinist, and ought\r\nnot to be startled to hear crime spoken of as an ancestral trait."\r\n\r\n"In point of fact," said Dr. Leete, "our use of the word is no\r\nreflection at all on your generation, if, begging Edith\'s pardon, we\r\nmay call it yours, so far as seeming to imply that we think ourselves,\r\napart from our circumstances, better than you were. In your day fully\r\nnineteen twentieths of the crime, using the word broadly to include\r\nall sorts of misdemeanors, resulted from the inequality in the\r\npossessions of individuals; want tempted the poor, lust of greater\r\ngains, or the desire to preserve former gains, tempted the well-to-do.\r\nDirectly or indirectly, the desire for money, which then meant every\r\ngood thing, was the motive of all this crime, the taproot of a vast\r\npoison growth, which the machinery of law, courts, and police could\r\nbarely prevent from choking your civilization outright. When we made\r\nthe nation the sole trustee of the wealth of the people, and\r\nguaranteed to all abundant maintenance, on the one hand abolishing\r\nwant, and on the other checking the accumulation of riches, we cut\r\nthis root, and the poison tree that overshadowed your society\r\nwithered, like Jonah\'s gourd, in a day. As for the comparatively small\r\nclass of violent crimes against persons, unconnected with any idea of\r\ngain, they were almost wholly confined, even in your day, to the\r\nignorant and bestial; and in these days, when education and good\r\nmanners are not the monopoly of a few, but universal, such atrocities\r\nare scarcely ever heard of. You now see why the word "atavism" is used\r\nfor crime. It is because nearly all forms of crime known to you are\r\nmotiveless now, and when they appear can only be explained as the\r\noutcropping of ancestral traits. You used to call persons who stole,\r\nevidently without any rational motive, kleptomaniacs, and when the\r\ncase was clear deemed it absurd to punish them as thieves. Your\r\nattitude toward the genuine kleptomaniac is precisely ours toward the\r\nvictim of atavism, an attitude of compassion and firm but gentle\r\nrestraint.\r\n\r\n"Your courts must have an easy time of it," I observed. "With no\r\nprivate property to speak of, no disputes between citizens over\r\nbusiness relations, no real estate to divide or debts to collect,\r\nthere must be absolutely no civil business at all for them; and with\r\nno offenses against property, and mighty few of any sort to provide\r\ncriminal cases, I should think you might almost do without judges and\r\nlawyers altogether."\r\n\r\n"We do without the lawyers, certainly," was Dr. Leete\'s reply. "It\r\nwould not seem reasonable to us, in a case where the only interest of\r\nthe nation is to find out the truth, that persons should take part in\r\nthe proceedings who had an acknowledged motive to color it."\r\n\r\n"But who defends the accused?"\r\n\r\n"If he is a criminal he needs no defense, for he pleads guilty in most\r\ninstances," replied Dr. Leete. "The plea of the accused is not a mere\r\nformality with us, as with you. It is usually the end of the case."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean that the man who pleads not guilty is thereupon\r\ndischarged?"\r\n\r\n"No, I do not mean that. He is not accused on light grounds, and if he\r\ndenies his guilt, must still be tried. But trials are few, for in most\r\ncases the guilty man pleads guilty. When he makes a false plea and is\r\nclearly proved guilty, his penalty is doubled. Falsehood is, however,\r\nso despised among us that few offenders would lie to save themselves."\r\n\r\n"That is the most astounding thing you have yet told me," I exclaimed.\r\n"If lying has gone out of fashion, this is indeed the \'new heavens and\r\nthe new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness,\' which the prophet\r\nforetold."\r\n\r\n"Such is, in fact, the belief of some persons nowadays," was the\r\ndoctor\'s answer. "They hold that we have entered upon the millennium,\r\nand the theory from their point of view does not lack plausibility.\r\nBut as to your astonishment at finding that the world has outgrown\r\nlying, there is really no ground for it. Falsehood, even in your day,\r\nwas not common between gentlemen and ladies, social equals. The lie of\r\nfear was the refuge of cowardice, and the lie of fraud the device of\r\nthe cheat. The inequalities of men and the lust of acquisition offered\r\na constant premium on lying at that time. Yet even then, the man who\r\nneither feared another nor desired to defraud him scorned falsehood.\r\nBecause we are now all social equals, and no man either has anything\r\nto fear from another or can gain anything by deceiving him, the\r\ncontempt of falsehood is so universal that it is rarely, as I told\r\nyou, that even a criminal in other respects will be found willing to\r\nlie. When, however, a plea of not guilty is returned, the judge\r\nappoints two colleagues to state the opposite sides of the case. How\r\nfar these men are from being like your hired advocates and\r\nprosecutors, determined to acquit or convict, may appear from the fact\r\nthat unless both agree that the verdict found is just, the case is\r\ntried over, while anything like bias in the tone of either of the\r\njudges stating the case would be a shocking scandal."\r\n\r\n"Do I understand," I said, "that it is a judge who states each side of\r\nthe case as well as a judge who hears it?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. The judges take turns in serving on the bench and at the\r\nbar, and are expected to maintain the judicial temper equally whether\r\nin stating or deciding a case. The system is indeed in effect that of\r\ntrial by three judges occupying different points of view as to the\r\ncase. When they agree upon a verdict, we believe it to be as near to\r\nabsolute truth as men well can come."\r\n\r\n"You have given up the jury system, then?"\r\n\r\n"It was well enough as a corrective in the days of hired advocates,\r\nand a bench sometimes venal, and often with a tenure that made it\r\ndependent, but is needless now. No conceivable motive but justice\r\ncould actuate our judges."\r\n\r\n"How are these magistrates selected?"\r\n\r\n"They are an honorable exception to the rule which discharges all men\r\nfrom service at the age of forty-five. The President of the nation\r\nappoints the necessary judges year by year from the class reaching\r\nthat age. The number appointed is, of course, exceedingly few, and\r\nthe honor so high that it is held an offset to the additional term of\r\nservice which follows, and though a judge\'s appointment may be\r\ndeclined, it rarely is. The term is five years, without eligibility to\r\nreappointment. The members of the Supreme Court, which is the guardian\r\nof the constitution, are selected from among the lower judges. When a\r\nvacancy in that court occurs, those of the lower judges, whose terms\r\nexpire that year, select, as their last official act, the one of their\r\ncolleagues left on the bench whom they deem fittest to fill it."\r\n\r\n"There being no legal profession to serve as a school for judges," I\r\nsaid, "they must, of course, come directly from the law school to the\r\nbench."\r\n\r\n"We have no such things as law schools," replied the doctor, smiling.\r\n"The law as a special science is obsolete. It was a system of\r\ncasuistry which the elaborate artificiality of the old order of\r\nsociety absolutely required to interpret it, but only a few of the\r\nplainest and simplest legal maxims have any application to the\r\nexisting state of the world. Everything touching the relations of men\r\nto one another is now simpler, beyond any comparison, than in your\r\nday. We should have no sort of use for the hair-splitting experts who\r\npresided and argued in your courts. You must not imagine, however,\r\nthat we have any disrespect for those ancient worthies because we have\r\nno use for them. On the contrary, we entertain an unfeigned respect,\r\namounting almost to awe, for the men who alone understood and were\r\nable to expound the interminable complexity of the rights of property,\r\nand the relations of commercial and personal dependence involved in\r\nyour system. What, indeed, could possibly give a more powerful\r\nimpression of the intricacy and artificiality of that system than the\r\nfact that it was necessary to set apart from other pursuits the cream\r\nof the intellect of every generation, in order to provide a body of\r\npundits able to make it even vaguely intelligible to those whose fates\r\nit determined. The treatises of your great lawyers, the works of\r\nBlackstone and Chitty, of Story and Parsons, stand in our museums,\r\nside by side with the tomes of Duns Scotus and his fellow scholastics,\r\nas curious monuments of intellectual subtlety devoted to subjects\r\nequally remote from the interests of modern men. Our judges are simply\r\nwidely informed, judicious, and discreet men of ripe years.\r\n\r\n"I should not fail to speak of one important function of the minor\r\njudges," added Dr. Leete. "This is to adjudicate all cases where a\r\nprivate of the industrial army makes a complaint of unfairness against\r\nan officer. All such questions are heard and settled without appeal by\r\na single judge, three judges being required only in graver cases. The\r\nefficiency of industry requires the strictest discipline in the army\r\nof labor, but the claim of the workman to just and considerate\r\ntreatment is backed by the whole power of the nation. The officer\r\ncommands and the private obeys, but no officer is so high that he\r\nwould dare display an overbearing manner toward a workman of the\r\nlowest class. As for churlishness or rudeness by an official of any\r\nsort, in his relations to the public, not one among minor offenses is\r\nmore sure of a prompt penalty than this. Not only justice but civility\r\nis enforced by our judges in all sorts of intercourse. No value of\r\nservice is accepted as a set-off to boorish or offensive manners."\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me, as Dr. Leete was speaking, that in all his talk I\r\nhad heard much of the nation and nothing of the state governments. Had\r\nthe organization of the nation as an industrial unit done away with\r\nthe states? I asked.\r\n\r\n"Necessarily," he replied. "The state governments would have\r\ninterfered with the control and discipline of the industrial army,\r\nwhich, of course, required to be central and uniform. Even if the\r\nstate governments had not become inconvenient for other reasons, they\r\nwere rendered superfluous by the prodigious simplification in the task\r\nof government since your day. Almost the sole function of the\r\nadministration now is that of directing the industries of the country.\r\nMost of the purposes for which governments formerly existed no longer\r\nremain to be subserved. We have no army or navy, and no military\r\norganization. We have no departments of state or treasury, no excise\r\nor revenue services, no taxes or tax collectors. The only function\r\nproper of government, as known to you, which still remains, is the\r\njudiciary and police system. I have already explained to you how\r\nsimple is our judicial system as compared with your huge and complex\r\nmachine. Of course the same absence of crime and temptation to it,\r\nwhich make the duties of judges so light, reduces the number and\r\nduties of the police to a minimum."\r\n\r\n"But with no state legislatures, and Congress meeting only once in\r\nfive years, how do you get your legislation done?"\r\n\r\n"We have no legislation," replied Dr. Leete, "that is, next to none.\r\nIt is rarely that Congress, even when it meets, considers any new laws\r\nof consequence, and then it only has power to commend them to the\r\nfollowing Congress, lest anything be done hastily. If you will\r\nconsider a moment, Mr. West, you will see that we have nothing to make\r\nlaws about. The fundamental principles on which our society is founded\r\nsettle for all time the strifes and misunderstandings which in your\r\nday called for legislation.\r\n\r\n"Fully ninety-nine hundredths of the laws of that time concerned the\r\ndefinition and protection of private property and the relations of\r\nbuyers and sellers. There is neither private property, beyond personal\r\nbelongings, now, nor buying and selling, and therefore the occasion of\r\nnearly all the legislation formerly necessary has passed away.\r\nFormerly, society was a pyramid poised on its apex. All the\r\ngravitations of human nature were constantly tending to topple it\r\nover, and it could be maintained upright, or rather upwrong (if you\r\nwill pardon the feeble witticism), by an elaborate system of\r\nconstantly renewed props and buttresses and guy-ropes in the form of\r\nlaws. A central Congress and forty state legislatures, turning out\r\nsome twenty thousand laws a year, could not make new props fast enough\r\nto take the place of those which were constantly breaking down or\r\nbecoming ineffectual through some shifting of the strain. Now society\r\nrests on its base, and is in as little need of artificial supports as\r\nthe everlasting hills."\r\n\r\n"But you have at least municipal governments besides the one central\r\nauthority?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly, and they have important and extensive functions in looking\r\nout for the public comfort and recreation, and the improvement and\r\nembellishment of the villages and cities."\r\n\r\n"But having no control over the labor of their people, or means of\r\nhiring it, how can they do anything?"\r\n\r\n"Every town or city is conceded the right to retain, for its own\r\npublic works, a certain proportion of the quota of labor its citizens\r\ncontribute to the nation. This proportion, being assigned it as so\r\nmuch credit, can be applied in any way desired."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Edith casually inquired if I had yet revisited the\r\nunderground chamber in the garden in which I had been found.\r\n\r\n"Not yet," I replied. "To be frank, I have shrunk thus far from doing\r\nso, lest the visit might revive old associations rather too strongly\r\nfor my mental equilibrium."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes!" she said, "I can imagine that you have done well to stay\r\naway. I ought to have thought of that."\r\n\r\n"No," I said, "I am glad you spoke of it. The danger, if there was\r\nany, existed only during the first day or two. Thanks to you, chiefly\r\nand always, I feel my footing now so firm in this new world, that if\r\nyou will go with me to keep the ghosts off, I should really like to\r\nvisit the place this afternoon."\r\n\r\nEdith demurred at first, but, finding that I was in earnest, consented\r\nto accompany me. The rampart of earth thrown up from the excavation\r\nwas visible among the trees from the house, and a few steps brought us\r\nto the spot. All remained as it was at the point when work was\r\ninterrupted by the discovery of the tenant of the chamber, save that\r\nthe door had been opened and the slab from the roof replaced.\r\nDescending the sloping sides of the excavation, we went in at the door\r\nand stood within the dimly-lighted room.\r\n\r\nEverything was just as I had beheld it last on that evening one\r\nhundred and thirteen years previous, just before closing my eyes for\r\nthat long sleep. I stood for some time silently looking about me. I\r\nsaw that my companion was furtively regarding me with an expression of\r\nawed and sympathetic curiosity. I put out my hand to her and she\r\nplaced hers in it, the soft fingers responding with a reassuring\r\npressure to my clasp. Finally she whispered, "Had we not better go out\r\nnow? You must not try yourself too far. Oh, how strange it must be to\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\n"On the contrary," I replied, "it does not seem strange; that is the\r\nstrangest part of it."\r\n\r\n"Not strange?" she echoed.\r\n\r\n"Even so," I replied. "The emotions with which you evidently credit\r\nme, and which I anticipated would attend this visit, I simply do not\r\nfeel. I realize all that these surroundings suggest, but without the\r\nagitation I expected. You can\'t be nearly as much surprised at this as\r\nI am myself. Ever since that terrible morning when you came to my\r\nhelp, I have tried to avoid thinking of my former life, just as I have\r\navoided coming here, for fear of the agitating effects. I am for all\r\nthe world like a man who has permitted an injured limb to lie\r\nmotionless under the impression that it is exquisitely sensitive, and\r\non trying to move it finds that it is paralyzed."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean your memory is gone?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all. I remember everything connected with my former life, but\r\nwith a total lack of keen sensation. I remember it for clearness as if\r\nit had been but a day since then, but my feelings about what I\r\nremember are as faint as if to my consciousness, as well as in fact, a\r\nhundred years had intervened. Perhaps it is possible to explain this,\r\ntoo. The effect of change in surroundings is like that of lapse of\r\ntime in making the past seem remote. When I first woke from that\r\ntrance, my former life appeared as yesterday, but now, since I have\r\nlearned to know my new surroundings, and to realize the prodigious\r\nchanges that have transformed the world, I no longer find it hard, but\r\nvery easy, to realize that I have slept a century. Can you conceive of\r\nsuch a thing as living a hundred years in four days? It really seems\r\nto me that I have done just that, and that it is this experience which\r\nhas given so remote and unreal an appearance to my former life. Can\r\nyou see how such a thing might be?"\r\n\r\n"I can conceive it," replied Edith, meditatively, "and I think we\r\nought all to be thankful that it is so, for it will save you much\r\nsuffering, I am sure."\r\n\r\n"Imagine," I said, in an effort to explain, as much to myself as to\r\nher, the strangeness of my mental condition, "that a man first heard\r\nof a bereavement many, many years, half a lifetime perhaps, after the\r\nevent occurred. I fancy his feeling would be perhaps something as mine\r\nis. When I think of my friends in the world of that former day, and\r\nthe sorrow they must have felt for me, it is with a pensive pity,\r\nrather than keen anguish, as of a sorrow long, long ago ended."\r\n\r\n"You have told us nothing yet of your friends," said Edith. "Had you\r\nmany to mourn you?"\r\n\r\n"Thank God, I had very few relatives, none nearer than cousins," I\r\nreplied. "But there was one, not a relative, but dearer to me than any\r\nkin of blood. She had your name. She was to have been my wife soon. Ah\r\nme!"\r\n\r\n"Ah me!" sighed the Edith by my side. "Think of the heartache she must\r\nhave had."\r\n\r\nSomething in the deep feeling of this gentle girl touched a chord in\r\nmy benumbed heart. My eyes, before so dry, were flooded with the tears\r\nthat had till now refused to come. When I had regained my composure, I\r\nsaw that she too had been weeping freely.\r\n\r\n"God bless your tender heart," I said. "Would you like to see her\r\npicture?"\r\n\r\nA small locket with Edith Bartlett\'s picture, secured about my neck\r\nwith a gold chain, had lain upon my breast all through that long\r\nsleep, and removing this I opened and gave it to my companion. She\r\ntook it with eagerness, and after poring long over the sweet face,\r\ntouched the picture with her lips.\r\n\r\n"I know that she was good and lovely enough to well deserve your\r\ntears," she said; "but remember her heartache was over long ago, and\r\nshe has been in heaven for nearly a century."\r\n\r\nIt was indeed so. Whatever her sorrow had once been, for nearly a\r\ncentury she had ceased to weep, and, my sudden passion spent, my own\r\ntears dried away. I had loved her very dearly in my other life, but it\r\nwas a hundred years ago! I do not know but some may find in this\r\nconfession evidence of lack of feeling, but I think, perhaps, that\r\nnone can have had an experience sufficiently like mine to enable them\r\nto judge me. As we were about to leave the chamber, my eye rested upon\r\nthe great iron safe which stood in one corner. Calling my companion\'s\r\nattention to it, I said:--\r\n\r\n"This was my strong room as well as my sleeping room. In the safe\r\nyonder are several thousand dollars in gold, and any amount of\r\nsecurities. If I had known when I went to sleep that night just how\r\nlong my nap would be, I should still have thought that the gold was a\r\nsafe provision for my needs in any country or any century, however\r\ndistant. That a time would ever come when it would lose its purchasing\r\npower, I should have considered the wildest of fancies. Nevertheless,\r\nhere I wake up to find myself among a people of whom a cartload of\r\ngold will not procure a loaf of bread."\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, I did not succeed in impressing Edith that there\r\nwas anything remarkable in this fact. "Why in the world should it?"\r\nshe merely asked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had been suggested by Dr. Leete that we should devote the next\r\nmorning to an inspection of the schools and colleges of the city, with\r\nsome attempt on his own part at an explanation of the educational\r\nsystem of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\n"You will see," said he, as we set out after breakfast, "many very\r\nimportant differences between our methods of education and yours, but\r\nthe main difference is that nowadays all persons equally have those\r\nopportunities of higher education which in your day only an\r\ninfinitesimal portion of the population enjoyed. We should think we\r\nhad gained nothing worth speaking of, in equalizing the physical\r\ncomfort of men, without this educational equality."\r\n\r\n"The cost must be very great," I said.\r\n\r\n"If it took half the revenue of the nation, nobody would grudge it,"\r\nreplied Dr. Leete, "nor even if it took it all save a bare pittance.\r\nBut in truth the expense of educating ten thousand youth is not ten\r\nnor five times that of educating one thousand. The principle which\r\nmakes all operations on a large scale proportionally cheaper than on a\r\nsmall scale holds as to education also."\r\n\r\n"College education was terribly expensive in my day," said I.\r\n\r\n"If I have not been misinformed by our historians," Dr. Leete\r\nanswered, "it was not college education but college dissipation and\r\nextravagance which cost so highly. The actual expense of your colleges\r\nappears to have been very low, and would have been far lower if their\r\npatronage had been greater. The higher education nowadays is as cheap\r\nas the lower, as all grades of teachers, like all other workers,\r\nreceive the same support. We have simply added to the common school\r\nsystem of compulsory education, in vogue in Massachusetts a hundred\r\nyears ago, a half dozen higher grades, carrying the youth to the age\r\nof twenty-one and giving him what you used to call the education of a\r\ngentleman, instead of turning him loose at fourteen or fifteen with no\r\nmental equipment beyond reading, writing, and the multiplication\r\ntable."\r\n\r\n"Setting aside the actual cost of these additional years of\r\neducation," I replied, "we should not have thought we could afford the\r\nloss of time from industrial pursuits. Boys of the poorer classes\r\nusually went to work at sixteen or younger, and knew their trade at\r\ntwenty."\r\n\r\n"We should not concede you any gain even in material product by that\r\nplan," Dr. Leete replied. "The greater efficiency which education\r\ngives to all sorts of labor, except the rudest, makes up in a short\r\nperiod for the time lost in acquiring it."\r\n\r\n"We should also have been afraid," said I, "that a high education,\r\nwhile it adapted men to the professions, would set them against manual\r\nlabor of all sorts."\r\n\r\n"That was the effect of high education in your day, I have read,"\r\nreplied the doctor; "and it was no wonder, for manual labor meant\r\nassociation with a rude, coarse, and ignorant class of people. There\r\nis no such class now. It was inevitable that such a feeling should\r\nexist then, for the further reason that all men receiving a high\r\neducation were understood to be destined for the professions or for\r\nwealthy leisure, and such an education in one neither rich nor\r\nprofessional was a proof of disappointed aspirations, an evidence of\r\nfailure, a badge of inferiority rather than superiority. Nowadays, of\r\ncourse, when the highest education is deemed necessary to fit a man\r\nmerely to live, without any reference to the sort of work he may do,\r\nits possession conveys no such implication."\r\n\r\n"After all," I remarked, "no amount of education can cure natural\r\ndullness or make up for original mental deficiencies. Unless the\r\naverage natural mental capacity of men is much above its level in my\r\nday, a high education must be pretty nearly thrown away on a large\r\nelement of the population. We used to hold that a certain amount of\r\nsusceptibility to educational influences is required to make a mind\r\nworth cultivating, just as a certain natural fertility in soil is\r\nrequired if it is to repay tilling."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Dr. Leete, "I am glad you used that illustration, for it is\r\njust the one I would have chosen to set forth the modern view of\r\neducation. You say that land so poor that the product will not repay\r\nthe labor of tilling is not cultivated. Nevertheless, much land that\r\ndoes not begin to repay tilling by its product was cultivated in your\r\nday and is in ours. I refer to gardens, parks, lawns, and, in general,\r\nto pieces of land so situated that, were they left to grow up to weeds\r\nand briers, they would be eyesores and inconveniences to all about.\r\nThey are therefore tilled, and though their product is little, there\r\nis yet no land that, in a wider sense, better repays cultivation. So\r\nit is with the men and women with whom we mingle in the relations of\r\nsociety, whose voices are always in our ears, whose behavior in\r\ninnumerable ways affects our enjoyment,--who are, in fact, as much\r\nconditions of our lives as the air we breathe, or any of the physical\r\nelements on which we depend. If, indeed, we could not afford to\r\neducate everybody, we should choose the coarsest and dullest by\r\nnature, rather than the brightest, to receive what education we could\r\ngive. The naturally refined and intellectual can better dispense with\r\naids to culture than those less fortunate in natural endowments.\r\n\r\n"To borrow a phrase which was often used in your day, we should not\r\nconsider life worth living if we had to be surrounded by a population\r\nof ignorant, boorish, coarse, wholly uncultivated men and women, as\r\nwas the plight of the few educated in your day. Is a man satisfied,\r\nmerely because he is perfumed himself, to mingle with a malodorous\r\ncrowd? Could he take more than a very limited satisfaction, even in a\r\npalatial apartment, if the windows on all four sides opened into\r\nstable yards? And yet just that was the situation of those considered\r\nmost fortunate as to culture and refinement in your day. I know that\r\nthe poor and ignorant envied the rich and cultured then; but to us the\r\nlatter, living as they did, surrounded by squalor and brutishness,\r\nseem little better off than the former. The cultured man in your age\r\nwas like one up to the neck in a nauseous bog solacing himself with a\r\nsmelling bottle. You see, perhaps, now, how we look at this question\r\nof universal high education. No single thing is so important to every\r\nman as to have for neighbors intelligent, companionable persons. There\r\nis nothing, therefore, which the nation can do for him that will\r\nenhance so much his own happiness as to educate his neighbors. When it\r\nfails to do so, the value of his own education to him is reduced by\r\nhalf, and many of the tastes he has cultivated are made positive\r\nsources of pain.\r\n\r\n"To educate some to the highest degree, and leave the mass wholly\r\nuncultivated, as you did, made the gap between them almost like that\r\nbetween different natural species, which have no means of\r\ncommunication. What could be more inhuman than this consequence of a\r\npartial enjoyment of education! Its universal and equal enjoyment\r\nleaves, indeed, the differences between men as to natural endowments\r\nas marked as in a state of nature, but the level of the lowest is\r\nvastly raised. Brutishness is eliminated. All have some inkling of the\r\nhumanities, some appreciation of the things of the mind, and an\r\nadmiration for the still higher culture they have fallen short of.\r\nThey have become capable of receiving and imparting, in various\r\ndegrees, but all in some measure, the pleasures and inspirations of a\r\nrefined social life. The cultured society of the nineteenth\r\ncentury,--what did it consist of but here and there a few microscopic\r\noases in a vast, unbroken wilderness? The proportion of individuals\r\ncapable of intellectual sympathies or refined intercourse, to the mass\r\nof their contemporaries, used to be so infinitesimal as to be in any\r\nbroad view of humanity scarcely worth mentioning. One generation of\r\nthe world to-day represents a greater volume of intellectual life than\r\nany five centuries ever did before.\r\n\r\n"There is still another point I should mention in stating the grounds\r\non which nothing less than the universality of the best education\r\ncould now be tolerated," continued Dr. Leete, "and that is, the\r\ninterest of the coming generation in having educated parents. To put\r\nthe matter in a nutshell, there are three main grounds on which our\r\neducational system rests: first, the right of every man to the\r\ncompletest education the nation can give him on his own account, as\r\nnecessary to his enjoyment of himself; second, the right of his\r\nfellow-citizens to have him educated, as necessary to their enjoyment\r\nof his society; third, the right of the unborn to be guaranteed an\r\nintelligent and refined parentage."\r\n\r\nI shall not describe in detail what I saw in the schools that day.\r\nHaving taken but slight interest in educational matters in my former\r\nlife, I could offer few comparisons of interest. Next to the fact of\r\nthe universality of the higher as well as the lower education, I was\r\nmost struck with the prominence given to physical culture, and the\r\nfact that proficiency in athletic feats and games as well as in\r\nscholarship had a place in the rating of the youth.\r\n\r\n"The faculty of education," Dr. Leete explained, "is held to the same\r\nresponsibility for the bodies as for the minds of its charges. The\r\nhighest possible physical, as well as mental, development of every one\r\nis the double object of a curriculum which lasts from the age of six\r\nto that of twenty-one."\r\n\r\nThe magnificent health of the young people in the schools impressed me\r\nstrongly. My previous observations, not only of the notable personal\r\nendowments of the family of my host, but of the people I had seen in\r\nmy walks abroad, had already suggested the idea that there must have\r\nbeen something like a general improvement in the physical standard of\r\nthe race since my day, and now, as I compared these stalwart young men\r\nand fresh, vigorous maidens with the young people I had seen in the\r\nschools of the nineteenth century, I was moved to impart my thought to\r\nDr. Leete. He listened with great interest to what I said.\r\n\r\n"Your testimony on this point," he declared, "is invaluable. We\r\nbelieve that there has been such an improvement as you speak of, but\r\nof course it could only be a matter of theory with us. It is an\r\nincident of your unique position that you alone in the world of to-day\r\ncan speak with authority on this point. Your opinion, when you state\r\nit publicly, will, I assure you, make a profound sensation. For the\r\nrest it would be strange, certainly, if the race did not show an\r\nimprovement. In your day, riches debauched one class with idleness of\r\nmind and body, while poverty sapped the vitality of the masses by\r\noverwork, bad food, and pestilent homes. The labor required of\r\nchildren, and the burdens laid on women, enfeebled the very springs of\r\nlife. Instead of these maleficent circumstances, all now enjoy the\r\nmost favorable conditions of physical life; the young are carefully\r\nnurtured and studiously cared for; the labor which is required of all\r\nis limited to the period of greatest bodily vigor, and is never\r\nexcessive; care for one\'s self and one\'s family, anxiety as to\r\nlivelihood, the strain of a ceaseless battle for life--all these\r\ninfluences, which once did so much to wreck the minds and bodies of\r\nmen and women, are known no more. Certainly, an improvement of the\r\nspecies ought to follow such a change. In certain specific respects we\r\nknow, indeed, that the improvement has taken place. Insanity, for\r\ninstance, which in the nineteenth century was so terribly common a\r\nproduct of your insane mode of life, has almost disappeared, with its\r\nalternative, suicide."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had made an appointment to meet the ladies at the dining-hall for\r\ndinner, after which, having some engagement, they left us sitting at\r\ntable there, discussing our wine and cigars with a multitude of other\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n"Doctor," said I, in the course of our talk, "morally speaking, your\r\nsocial system is one which I should be insensate not to admire in\r\ncomparison with any previously in vogue in the world, and especially\r\nwith that of my own most unhappy century. If I were to fall into a\r\nmesmeric sleep to-night as lasting as that other, and meanwhile the\r\ncourse of time were to take a turn backward instead of forward, and I\r\nwere to wake up again in the nineteenth century, when I had told my\r\nfriends what I had seen, they would every one admit that your world\r\nwas a paradise of order, equity, and felicity. But they were a very\r\npractical people, my contemporaries, and after expressing their\r\nadmiration for the moral beauty and material splendor of the system,\r\nthey would presently begin to cipher and ask how you got the money to\r\nmake everybody so happy; for certainly, to support the whole nation at\r\na rate of comfort, and even luxury, such as I see around me, must\r\ninvolve vastly greater wealth than the nation produced in my day. Now,\r\nwhile I could explain to them pretty nearly everything else of the\r\nmain features of your system, I should quite fail to answer this\r\nquestion, and failing there, they would tell me, for they were very\r\nclose cipherers, that I had been dreaming; nor would they ever believe\r\nanything else. In my day, I know that the total annual product of the\r\nnation, although it might have been divided with absolute equality,\r\nwould not have come to more than three or four hundred dollars per\r\nhead, not very much more than enough to supply the necessities of life\r\nwith few or any of its comforts. How is it that you have so much\r\nmore?"\r\n\r\n"That is a very pertinent question, Mr. West," replied Dr. Leete, "and\r\nI should not blame your friends, in the case you supposed, if they\r\ndeclared your story all moonshine, failing a satisfactory reply to it.\r\nIt is a question which I cannot answer exhaustively at any one\r\nsitting, and as for the exact statistics to bear out my general\r\nstatements, I shall have to refer you for them to books in my library,\r\nbut it would certainly be a pity to leave you to be put to confusion\r\nby your old acquaintances, in case of the contingency you speak of,\r\nfor lack of a few suggestions.\r\n\r\n"Let us begin with a number of small items wherein we economize wealth\r\nas compared with you. We have no national, state, county, or\r\nmunicipal debts, or payments on their account. We have no sort of\r\nmilitary or naval expenditures for men or materials, no army, navy, or\r\nmilitia. We have no revenue service, no swarm of tax assessors and\r\ncollectors. As regards our judiciary, police, sheriffs, and jailers,\r\nthe force which Massachusetts alone kept on foot in your day far more\r\nthan suffices for the nation now. We have no criminal class preying\r\nupon the wealth of society as you had. The number of persons, more or\r\nless absolutely lost to the working force through physical disability,\r\nof the lame, sick, and debilitated, which constituted such a burden on\r\nthe able-bodied in your day, now that all live under conditions of\r\nhealth and comfort, has shrunk to scarcely perceptible proportions,\r\nand with every generation is becoming more completely eliminated.\r\n\r\n"Another item wherein we save is the disuse of money and the thousand\r\noccupations connected with financial operations of all sorts, whereby\r\nan army of men was formerly taken away from useful employments. Also\r\nconsider that the waste of the very rich in your day on inordinate\r\npersonal luxury has ceased, though, indeed, this item might easily be\r\nover-estimated. Again, consider that there are no idlers now, rich or\r\npoor,--no drones.\r\n\r\n"A very important cause of former poverty was the vast waste of labor\r\nand materials which resulted from domestic washing and cooking, and\r\nthe performing separately of innumerable other tasks to which we apply\r\nthe cooperative plan.\r\n\r\n"A larger economy than any of these--yes, of all together--is effected\r\nby the organization of our distributing system, by which the work done\r\nonce by the merchants, traders, storekeepers, with their various\r\ngrades of jobbers, wholesalers, retailers, agents, commercial\r\ntravelers, and middlemen of all sorts, with an excessive waste of\r\nenergy in needless transportation and interminable handlings, is\r\nperformed by one-tenth the number of hands and an unnecessary turn of\r\nnot one wheel. Something of what our distributing system is like you\r\nknow. Our statisticians calculate that one eightieth part of our\r\nworkers suffices for all the processes of distribution which in your\r\nday required one eighth of the population, so much being withdrawn\r\nfrom the force engaged in productive labor."\r\n\r\n"I begin to see," I said, "where you get your greater wealth."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon," replied Dr. Leete, "but you scarcely do as yet.\r\nThe economies I have mentioned thus far, in the aggregate, considering\r\nthe labor they would save directly and indirectly through saving of\r\nmaterial, might possibly be equivalent to the addition to your annual\r\nproduction of wealth of one-half its former total. These items are,\r\nhowever, scarcely worth mentioning in comparison with other prodigious\r\nwastes, now saved, which resulted inevitably from leaving the\r\nindustries of the nation to private enterprise. However great the\r\neconomies your contemporaries might have devised in the consumption\r\nof products, and however marvelous the progress of mechanical\r\ninvention, they could never have raised themselves out of the slough\r\nof poverty so long as they held to that system.\r\n\r\n"No mode more wasteful for utilizing human energy could be devised,\r\nand for the credit of the human intellect it should be remembered that\r\nthe system never was devised, but was merely a survival from the rude\r\nages when the lack of social organization made any sort of cooperation\r\nimpossible."\r\n\r\n"I will readily admit," I said, "that our industrial system was\r\nethically very bad, but as a mere wealth-making machine, apart from\r\nmoral aspects, it seemed to us admirable."\r\n\r\n"As I said," responded the doctor, "the subject is too large to\r\ndiscuss at length now, but if you are really interested to know the\r\nmain criticisms which we moderns make on your industrial system as\r\ncompared with our own, I can touch briefly on some of them.\r\n\r\n"The wastes which resulted from leaving the conduct of industry to\r\nirresponsible individuals, wholly without mutual understanding or\r\nconcert, were mainly four: first, the waste by mistaken undertakings;\r\nsecond, the waste from the competition and mutual hostility of those\r\nengaged in industry; third, the waste by periodical gluts and crises,\r\nwith the consequent interruptions of industry; fourth, the waste from\r\nidle capital and labor, at all times. Any one of these four great\r\nleaks, were all the others stopped, would suffice to make the\r\ndifference between wealth and poverty on the part of a nation.\r\n\r\n"Take the waste by mistaken undertakings, to begin with. In your day\r\nthe production and distribution of commodities being without concert\r\nor organization, there was no means of knowing just what demand there\r\nwas for any class of products, or what was the rate of supply.\r\nTherefore, any enterprise by a private capitalist was always a\r\ndoubtful experiment. The projector having no general view of the field\r\nof industry and consumption, such as our government has, could never\r\nbe sure either what the people wanted, or what arrangements other\r\ncapitalists were making to supply them. In view of this, we are not\r\nsurprised to learn that the chances were considered several to one in\r\nfavor of the failure of any given business enterprise, and that it was\r\ncommon for persons who at last succeeded in making a hit to have\r\nfailed repeatedly. If a shoemaker, for every pair of shoes he\r\nsucceeded in completing, spoiled the leather of four or five pair,\r\nbesides losing the time spent on them, he would stand about the same\r\nchance of getting rich as your contemporaries did with their system of\r\nprivate enterprise, and its average of four or five failures to one\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n"The next of the great wastes was that from competition. The field of\r\nindustry was a battlefield as wide as the world, in which the workers\r\nwasted, in assailing one another, energies which, if expended in\r\nconcerted effort, as to-day, would have enriched all. As for mercy or\r\nquarter in this warfare, there was absolutely no suggestion of it. To\r\ndeliberately enter a field of business and destroy the enterprises of\r\nthose who had occupied it previously, in order to plant one\'s own\r\nenterprise on their ruins, was an achievement which never failed to\r\ncommand popular admiration. Nor is there any stretch of fancy in\r\ncomparing this sort of struggle with actual warfare, so far as\r\nconcerns the mental agony and physical suffering which attended the\r\nstruggle, and the misery which overwhelmed the defeated and those\r\ndependent on them. Now nothing about your age is, at first sight, more\r\nastounding to a man of modern times than the fact that men engaged in\r\nthe same industry, instead of fraternizing as comrades and co-laborers\r\nto a common end, should have regarded each other as rivals and enemies\r\nto be throttled and overthrown. This certainly seems like sheer\r\nmadness, a scene from bedlam. But more closely regarded, it is seen to\r\nbe no such thing. Your contemporaries, with their mutual\r\nthroat-cutting, knew very well what they were at. The producers of the\r\nnineteenth century were not, like ours, working together for the\r\nmaintenance of the community, but each solely for his own maintenance\r\nat the expense of the community. If, in working to this end, he at the\r\nsame time increased the aggregate wealth, that was merely incidental.\r\nIt was just as feasible and as common to increase one\'s private hoard\r\nby practices injurious to the general welfare. One\'s worst enemies\r\nwere necessarily those of his own trade, for, under your plan of\r\nmaking private profit the motive of production, a scarcity of the\r\narticle he produced was what each particular producer desired. It was\r\nfor his interest that no more of it should be produced than he himself\r\ncould produce. To secure this consummation as far as circumstances\r\npermitted, by killing off and discouraging those engaged in his line\r\nof industry, was his constant effort. When he had billed off all he\r\ncould, his policy was to combine with those he could not kill, and\r\nconvert their mutual warfare into a warfare upon the public at large\r\nby cornering the market, as I believe you used to call it, and putting\r\nup prices to the highest point people would stand before going without\r\nthe goods. The day dream of the nineteenth century producer was to\r\ngain absolute control of the supply of some necessity of life, so that\r\nhe might keep the public at the verge of starvation, and always\r\ncommand famine prices for what he supplied. This, Mr. West, is what\r\nwas called in the nineteenth century a system of production. I will\r\nleave it to you if it does not seem, in some of its aspects, a great\r\ndeal more like a system for preventing production. Some time when we\r\nhave plenty of leisure I am going to ask you to sit down with me and\r\ntry to make me comprehend, as I never yet could, though I have\r\nstudied the matter a great deal, how such shrewd fellows as your\r\ncontemporaries appear to have been in many respects ever came to\r\nentrust the business of providing for the community to a class whose\r\ninterest it was to starve it. I assure you that the wonder with us is,\r\nnot that the world did not get rich under such a system, but that it\r\ndid not perish outright from want. This wonder increases as we go on\r\nto consider some of the other prodigious wastes that characterized it.\r\n\r\n"Apart from the waste of labor and capital by misdirected industry,\r\nand that from the constant bloodletting of your industrial warfare,\r\nyour system was liable to periodical convulsions, overwhelming alike\r\nthe wise and unwise, the successful cut-throat as well as his victim.\r\nI refer to the business crises at intervals of five to ten years,\r\nwhich wrecked the industries of the nation, prostrating all weak\r\nenterprises and crippling the strongest, and were followed by long\r\nperiods, often of many years, of so-called dull times, during which\r\nthe capitalists slowly regathered their dissipated strength while the\r\nlaboring classes starved and rioted. Then would ensue another brief\r\nseason of prosperity, followed in turn by another crisis and the\r\nensuing years of exhaustion. As commerce developed, making the nations\r\nmutually dependent, these arises became world-wide, while the\r\nobstinacy of the ensuing state of collapse increased with the area\r\naffected by the convulsions, and the consequent lack of rallying\r\ncentres. In proportion as the industries of the world multiplied and\r\nbecame complex, and the volume of capital involved was increased,\r\nthese business cataclysms became more frequent, till, in the latter\r\npart of the nineteenth century, there were two years of bad times to\r\none of good, and the system of industry, never before so extended or\r\nso imposing, seemed in danger of collapsing by its own weight. After\r\nendless discussions, your economists appear by that time to have\r\nsettled down to the despairing conclusion that there was no more\r\npossibility of preventing or controlling these crises than if they had\r\nbeen drouths or hurricanes. It only remained to endure them as\r\nnecessary evils, and when they had passed over to build up again the\r\nshattered structure of industry, as dwellers in an earthquake country\r\nkeep on rebuilding their cities on the same site.\r\n\r\n"So far as considering the causes of the trouble inherent in their\r\nindustrial system, your contemporaries were certainly correct. They\r\nwere in its very basis, and must needs become more and more maleficent\r\nas the business fabric grew in size and complexity. One of these\r\ncauses was the lack of any common control of the different industries,\r\nand the consequent impossibility of their orderly and coordinate\r\ndevelopment. It inevitably resulted from this lack that they were\r\ncontinually getting out of step with one another and out of relation\r\nwith the demand.\r\n\r\n"Of the latter there was no criterion such as organized distribution\r\ngives us, and the first notice that it had been exceeded in any group\r\nof industries was a crash of prices, bankruptcy of producers, stoppage\r\nof production, reduction of wages, or discharge of workmen. This\r\nprocess was constantly going on in many industries, even in what were\r\ncalled good times, but a crisis took place only when the industries\r\naffected were extensive. The markets then were glutted with goods, of\r\nwhich nobody wanted beyond a sufficiency at any price. The wages and\r\nprofits of those making the glutted classes of goods being reduced or\r\nwholly stopped, their purchasing power as consumers of other classes\r\nof goods, of which there was no natural glut, was taken away, and, as\r\na consequence, goods of which there was no natural glut became\r\nartificially glutted, till their prices also were broken down, and\r\ntheir makers thrown out of work and deprived of income. The crisis was\r\nby this time fairly under way, and nothing could check it till a\r\nnation\'s ransom had been wasted.\r\n\r\n"A cause, also inherent in your system, which often produced and\r\nalways terribly aggravated crises, was the machinery of money and\r\ncredit. Money was essential when production was in many private hands,\r\nand buying and selling was necessary to secure what one wanted. It\r\nwas, however, open to the obvious objection of substituting for food,\r\nclothing, and other things a merely conventional representative of\r\nthem. The confusion of mind which this favored, between goods and\r\ntheir representative, led the way to the credit system and its\r\nprodigious illusions. Already accustomed to accept money for\r\ncommodities, the people next accepted promises for money, and ceased\r\nto look at all behind the representative for the thing represented.\r\nMoney was a sign of real commodities, but credit was but the sign of a\r\nsign. There was a natural limit to gold and silver, that is, money\r\nproper, but none to credit, and the result was that the volume of\r\ncredit, that is, the promises of money, ceased to bear any\r\nascertainable proportion to the money, still less to the commodities,\r\nactually in existence. Under such a system, frequent and periodical\r\ncrises were necessitated by a law as absolute as that which brings to\r\nthe ground a structure overhanging its centre of gravity. It was one\r\nof your fictions that the government and the banks authorized by it\r\nalone issued money; but everybody who gave a dollar\'s credit issued\r\nmoney to that extent, which was as good as any to swell the\r\ncirculation till the next crises. The great extension of the credit\r\nsystem was a characteristic of the latter part of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, and accounts largely for the almost incessant business crises\r\nwhich marked that period. Perilous as credit was, you could not\r\ndispense with its use, for, lacking any national or other public\r\norganization of the capital of the country, it was the only means you\r\nhad for concentrating and directing it upon industrial enterprises. It\r\nwas in this way a most potent means for exaggerating the chief peril\r\nof the private enterprise system of industry by enabling particular\r\nindustries to absorb disproportionate amounts of the disposable\r\ncapital of the country, and thus prepare disaster. Business\r\nenterprises were always vastly in debt for advances of credit, both to\r\none another and to the banks and capitalists, and the prompt\r\nwithdrawal of this credit at the first sign of a crisis was generally\r\nthe precipitating cause of it.\r\n\r\n"It was the misfortune of your contemporaries that they had to cement\r\ntheir business fabric with a material which an accident might at any\r\nmoment turn into an explosive. They were in the plight of a man\r\nbuilding a house with dynamite for mortar, for credit can be compared\r\nwith nothing else.\r\n\r\n"If you would see how needless were these convulsions of business\r\nwhich I have been speaking of, and how entirely they resulted from\r\nleaving industry to private and unorganized management, just consider\r\nthe working of our system. Overproduction in special lines, which was\r\nthe great hobgoblin of your day, is impossible now, for by the\r\nconnection between distribution and production supply is geared to\r\ndemand like an engine to the governor which regulates its speed. Even\r\nsuppose by an error of judgment an excessive production of some\r\ncommodity. The consequent slackening or cessation of production in\r\nthat line throws nobody out of employment. The suspended workers are\r\nat once found occupation in some other department of the vast workshop\r\nand lose only the time spent in changing, while, as for the glut, the\r\nbusiness of the nation is large enough to carry any amount of product\r\nmanufactured in excess of demand till the latter overtakes it. In such\r\na case of over-production, as I have supposed, there is not with us,\r\nas with you, any complex machinery to get out of order and magnify a\r\nthousand times the original mistake. Of course, having not even money,\r\nwe still less have credit. All estimates deal directly with the real\r\nthings, the flour, iron, wood, wool, and labor, of which money and\r\ncredit were for you the very misleading representatives. In our\r\ncalculations of cost there can be no mistakes. Out of the annual\r\nproduct the amount necessary for the support of the people is taken,\r\nand the requisite labor to produce the next year\'s consumption\r\nprovided for. The residue of the material and labor represents what\r\ncan be safely expended in improvements. If the crops are bad, the\r\nsurplus for that year is less than usual, that is all. Except for\r\nslight occasional effects of such natural causes, there are no\r\nfluctuations of business; the material prosperity of the nation flows\r\non uninterruptedly from generation to generation, like an ever\r\nbroadening and deepening river.\r\n\r\n"Your business crises, Mr. West," continued the doctor, "like either\r\nof the great wastes I mentioned before, were enough, alone, to have\r\nkept your noses to the grindstone forever; but I have still to speak\r\nof one other great cause of your poverty, and that was the idleness of\r\na great part of your capital and labor. With us it is the business of\r\nthe administration to keep in constant employment every ounce of\r\navailable capital and labor in the country. In your day there was no\r\ngeneral control of either capital or labor, and a large part of both\r\nfailed to find employment. \'Capital,\' you used to say, \'is naturally\r\ntimid,\' and it would certainly have been reckless if it had not been\r\ntimid in an epoch when there was a large preponderance of probability\r\nthat any particular business venture would end in failure. There was\r\nno time when, if security could have been guaranteed it, the amount of\r\ncapital devoted to productive industry could not have been greatly\r\nincreased. The proportion of it so employed underwent constant\r\nextraordinary fluctuations, according to the greater or less feeling\r\nof uncertainty as to the stability of the industrial situation, so\r\nthat the output of the national industries greatly varied in different\r\nyears. But for the same reason that the amount of capital employed at\r\ntimes of special insecurity was far less than at times of somewhat\r\ngreater security, a very large proportion was never employed at all,\r\nbecause the hazard of business was always very great in the best of\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n"It should be also noted that the great amount of capital always\r\nseeking employment where tolerable safety could be insured terribly\r\nembittered the competition between capitalists when a promising\r\nopening presented itself. The idleness of capital, the result of its\r\ntimidity, of course meant the idleness of labor in corresponding\r\ndegree. Moreover, every change in the adjustments of business, every\r\nslightest alteration in the condition of commerce or manufactures, not\r\nto speak of the innumerable business failures that took place yearly,\r\neven in the best of times, were constantly throwing a multitude of men\r\nout of employment for periods of weeks or months, or even years. A\r\ngreat number of these seekers after employment were constantly\r\ntraversing the country, becoming in time professional vagabonds, then\r\ncriminals. \'Give us work!\' was the cry of an army of the unemployed at\r\nnearly all seasons, and in seasons of dullness in business this army\r\nswelled to a host so vast and desperate as to threaten the stability\r\nof the government. Could there conceivably be a more conclusive\r\ndemonstration of the imbecility of the system of private enterprise as\r\na method for enriching a nation than the fact that, in an age of such\r\ngeneral poverty and want of everything, capitalists had to throttle\r\none another to find a safe chance to invest their capital and workmen\r\nrioted and burned because they could find no work to do?\r\n\r\n"Now, Mr. West," continued Dr. Leete, "I want you to bear in mind that\r\nthese points of which I have been speaking indicate only negatively\r\nthe advantages of the national organization of industry by showing\r\ncertain fatal defects and prodigious imbecilities of the systems of\r\nprivate enterprise which are not found in it. These alone, you must\r\nadmit, would pretty well explain why the nation is so much richer than\r\nin your day. But the larger half of our advantage over you, the\r\npositive side of it, I have yet barely spoken of. Supposing the system\r\nof private enterprise in industry were without any of the great leaks\r\nI have mentioned; that there were no waste on account of misdirected\r\neffort growing out of mistakes as to the demand, and inability to\r\ncommand a general view of the industrial field. Suppose, also, there\r\nwere no neutralizing and duplicating of effort from competition.\r\nSuppose, also, there were no waste from business panics and crises\r\nthrough bankruptcy and long interruptions of industry, and also none\r\nfrom the idleness of capital and labor. Supposing these evils, which\r\nare essential to the conduct of industry by capital in private hands,\r\ncould all be miraculously prevented, and the system yet retained; even\r\nthen the superiority of the results attained by the modern industrial\r\nsystem of national control would remain overwhelming.\r\n\r\n"You used to have some pretty large textile manufacturing\r\nestablishments, even in your day, although not comparable with ours.\r\nNo doubt you have visited these great mills in your time, covering\r\nacres of ground, employing thousands of hands, and combining under one\r\nroof, under one control, the hundred distinct processes between, say,\r\nthe cotton bale and the bale of glossy calicoes. You have admired the\r\nvast economy of labor as of mechanical force resulting from the\r\nperfect interworking with the rest of every wheel and every hand. No\r\ndoubt you have reflected how much less the same force of workers\r\nemployed in that factory would accomplish if they were scattered, each\r\nman working independently. Would you think it an exaggeration to say\r\nthat the utmost product of those workers, working thus apart, however\r\namicable their relations might be, was increased not merely by a\r\npercentage, but many fold, when their efforts were organized under one\r\ncontrol? Well now, Mr. West, the organization of the industry of the\r\nnation under a single control, so that all its processes interlock,\r\nhas multiplied the total product over the utmost that could be done\r\nunder the former system, even leaving out of account the four great\r\nwastes mentioned, in the same proportion that the product of those\r\nmillworkers was increased by cooperation. The effectiveness of the\r\nworking force of a nation, under the myriad-headed leadership of\r\nprivate capital, even if the leaders were not mutual enemies, as\r\ncompared with that which it attains under a single head, may be\r\nlikened to the military efficiency of a mob, or a horde of barbarians\r\nwith a thousand petty chiefs, as compared with that of a disciplined\r\narmy under one general--such a fighting machine, for example, as the\r\nGerman army in the time of Von Moltke."\r\n\r\n"After what you have told me," I said, "I do not so much wonder that\r\nthe nation is richer now than then, but that you are not all\r\nCroesuses."\r\n\r\n"Well," replied Dr. Leete, "we are pretty well off. The rate at which\r\nwe live is as luxurious as we could wish. The rivalry of ostentation,\r\nwhich in your day led to extravagance in no way conducive to comfort,\r\nfinds no place, of course, in a society of people absolutely equal in\r\nresources, and our ambition stops at the surroundings which minister\r\nto the enjoyment of life. We might, indeed, have much larger incomes,\r\nindividually, if we chose so to use the surplus of our product, but we\r\nprefer to expend it upon public works and pleasures in which all\r\nshare, upon public halls and buildings, art galleries, bridges,\r\nstatuary, means or transit, and the conveniences of our cities, great\r\nmusical and theatrical exhibitions, and in providing on a vast scale\r\nfor the recreations of the people. You have not begun to see how we\r\nlive yet, Mr. West. At home we have comfort, but the splendor of our\r\nlife is, on its social side, that which we share with our fellows.\r\nWhen you know more of it you will see where the money goes, as you\r\nused to say, and I think you will agree that we do well so to expend\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"I suppose," observed Dr. Leete, as we strolled homeward from the\r\ndining hall, "that no reflection would have cut the men of your\r\nwealth-worshiping century more keenly than the suggestion that they\r\ndid not know how to make money. Nevertheless, that is just the verdict\r\nhistory has passed on them. Their system of unorganized and\r\nantagonistic industries was as absurd economically as it was morally\r\nabominable. Selfishness was their only science, and in industrial\r\nproduction selfishness is suicide. Competition, which is the instinct\r\nof selfishness, is another word for dissipation of energy, while\r\ncombination is the secret of efficient production; and not till the\r\nidea of increasing the individual hoard gives place to the idea of\r\nincreasing the common stock can industrial combination be realized,\r\nand the acquisition of wealth really begin. Even if the principle of\r\nshare and share alike for all men were not the only humane and\r\nrational basis for a society, we should still enforce it as\r\neconomically expedient, seeing that until the disintegrating influence\r\nof self-seeking is suppressed no true concert of industry is\r\npossible."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening, as I sat with Edith in the music room, listening to some\r\npieces in the programme of that day which had attracted my notice, I\r\ntook advantage of an interval in the music to say, "I have a question\r\nto ask you which I fear is rather indiscreet."\r\n\r\n"I am quite sure it is not that," she replied, encouragingly.\r\n\r\n"I am in the position of an eavesdropper," I continued, "who, having\r\noverheard a little of a matter not intended for him, though seeming to\r\nconcern him, has the impudence to come to the speaker for the rest."\r\n\r\n"An eavesdropper!" she repeated, looking puzzled.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said, "but an excusable one, as I think you will admit."\r\n\r\n"This is very mysterious," she replied.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said I, "so mysterious that often I have doubted whether I\r\nreally overheard at all what I am going to ask you about, or only\r\ndreamed it. I want you to tell me. The matter is this: When I was\r\ncoming out of that sleep of a century, the first impression of which I\r\nwas conscious was of voices talking around me, voices that afterwards\r\nI recognized as your father\'s, your mother\'s, and your own. First, I\r\nremember your father\'s voice saying, \'He is going to open his eyes. He\r\nhad better see but one person at first.\' Then you said, if I did not\r\ndream it all, \'Promise me, then, that you will not tell him.\' Your\r\nfather seemed to hesitate about promising, but you insisted, and your\r\nmother interposing, he finally promised, and when I opened my eyes I\r\nsaw only him."\r\n\r\nI had been quite serious when I said that I was not sure that I had\r\nnot dreamed the conversation I fancied I had overheard, so\r\nincomprehensible was it that these people should know anything of me,\r\na contemporary of their great-grandparents, which I did not know\r\nmyself. But when I saw the effect of my words upon Edith, I knew that\r\nit was no dream, but another mystery, and a more puzzling one than any\r\nI had before encountered. For from the moment that the drift of my\r\nquestion became apparent, she showed indications of the most acute\r\nembarrassment. Her eyes, always so frank and direct in expression, had\r\ndropped in a panic before mine, while her face crimsoned from neck to\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n"Pardon me," I said, as soon as I had recovered from bewilderment at\r\nthe extraordinary effect of my words. "It seems, then, that I was not\r\ndreaming. There is some secret, something about me, which you are\r\nwithholding from me. Really, doesn\'t it seem a little hard that a\r\nperson in my position should not be given all the information possible\r\nconcerning himself?"\r\n\r\n"It does not concern you--that is, not directly. It is not about\r\nyou--exactly," she replied, scarcely audibly.\r\n\r\n"But it concerns me in some way," I persisted. "It must be something\r\nthat would interest me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know even that," she replied, venturing a momentary glance at\r\nmy face, furiously blushing, and yet with a quaint smile flickering\r\nabout her lips which betrayed a certain perception of humor in the\r\nsituation despite its embarrassment,--"I am not sure that it would\r\neven interest you."\r\n\r\n"Your father would have told me," I insisted, with an accent of\r\nreproach. "It was you who forbade him. He thought I ought to know."\r\n\r\nShe did not reply. She was so entirely charming in her confusion that\r\nI was now prompted, as much by the desire to prolong the situation as\r\nby my original curiosity, to importune her further.\r\n\r\n"Am I never to know? Will you never tell me?" I said.\r\n\r\n"It depends," she answered, after a long pause.\r\n\r\n"On what?" I persisted.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you ask too much," she replied. Then, raising to mine a face\r\nwhich inscrutable eyes, flushed cheeks, and smiling lips combined to\r\nrender perfectly bewitching, she added, "What should you think if I\r\nsaid that it depended on--yourself?"\r\n\r\n"On myself?" I echoed. "How can that possibly be?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. West, we are losing some charming music," was her only reply to\r\nthis, and turning to the telephone, at a touch of her finger she set\r\nthe air to swaying to the rhythm of an adagio. After that she took\r\ngood care that the music should leave no opportunity for conversation.\r\nShe kept her face averted from me, and pretended to be absorbed in the\r\nairs, but that it was a mere pretense the crimson tide standing at\r\nflood in her cheeks sufficiently betrayed.\r\n\r\nWhen at length she suggested that I might have heard all I cared to,\r\nfor that time, and we rose to leave the room, she came straight up to\r\nme and said, without raising her eyes, "Mr. West, you say I have been\r\ngood to you. I have not been particularly so, but if you think I have,\r\nI want you to promise me that you will not try again to make me tell\r\nyou this thing you have asked to-night, and that you will not try to\r\nfind it out from any one else,--my father or mother, for instance."\r\n\r\nTo such an appeal there was but one reply possible. "Forgive me for\r\ndistressing you. Of course I will promise," I said. "I would never\r\nhave asked you if I had fancied it could distress you. But do you\r\nblame me for being curious?"\r\n\r\n"I do not blame you at all."\r\n\r\n"And some time," I added, "if I do not tease you, you may tell me of\r\nyour own accord. May I not hope so?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," she murmured.\r\n\r\n"Only perhaps?"\r\n\r\nLooking up, she read my face with a quick, deep glance. "Yes," she\r\nsaid, "I think I may tell you--some time;" and so our conversation\r\nended, for she gave me no chance to say anything more.\r\n\r\nThat night I don\'t think even Dr. Pillsbury could have put me to\r\nsleep, till toward morning at least. Mysteries had been my accustomed\r\nfood for days now, but none had before confronted me at once so\r\nmysterious and so fascinating as this, the solution of which Edith\r\nLeete had forbidden me even to seek. It was a double mystery. How, in\r\nthe first place, was it conceivable that she should know any secret\r\nabout me, a stranger from a strange age? In the second place, even if\r\nshe should know such a secret, how account for the agitating effect\r\nwhich the knowledge of it seemed to have upon her? There are puzzles\r\nso difficult that one cannot even get so far as a conjecture as to the\r\nsolution, and this seemed one of them. I am usually of too practical a\r\nturn to waste time on such conundrums; but the difficulty of a riddle\r\nembodied in a beautiful young girl does not detract from its\r\nfascination. In general, no doubt, maidens\' blushes may be safely\r\nassumed to tell the same tale to young men in all ages and races, but\r\nto give that interpretation to Edith\'s crimson cheeks would,\r\nconsidering my position and the length of time I had known her, and\r\nstill more the fact that this mystery dated from before I had known\r\nher at all, be a piece of utter fatuity. And yet she was an angel, and\r\nI should not have been a young man if reason and common sense had been\r\nable quite to banish a roseate tinge from my dreams that night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the morning I went down stairs early in the hope of seeing Edith\r\nalone. In this, however, I was disappointed. Not finding her in the\r\nhouse, I sought her in the garden, but she was not there. In the\r\ncourse of my wanderings I visited the underground chamber, and sat\r\ndown there to rest. Upon the reading table in the chamber several\r\nperiodicals and newspapers lay, and thinking that Dr. Leete might be\r\ninterested in glancing over a Boston daily of 1887, I brought one of\r\nthe papers with me into the house when I came.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast I met Edith. She blushed as she greeted me, but was\r\nperfectly self-possessed. As we sat at table, Dr. Leete amused himself\r\nwith looking over the paper I had brought in. There was in it, as in\r\nall the newspapers of that date, a great deal about the labor\r\ntroubles, strikes, lockouts, boycotts, the programmes of labor\r\nparties, and the wild threats of the anarchists.\r\n\r\n"By the way," said I, as the doctor read aloud to us some of these\r\nitems, "what part did the followers of the red flag take in the\r\nestablishment of the new order of things? They were making\r\nconsiderable noise the last thing that I knew."\r\n\r\n"They had nothing to do with it except to hinder it, of course,"\r\nreplied Dr. Leete. "They did that very effectually while they lasted,\r\nfor their talk so disgusted people as to deprive the best considered\r\nprojects for social reform of a hearing. The subsidizing of those\r\nfellows was one of the shrewdest moves of the opponents of reform."\r\n\r\n"Subsidizing them!" I exclaimed in astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Certainly," replied Dr. Leete. "No historical authority nowadays\r\ndoubts that they were paid by the great monopolies to wave the red\r\nflag and talk about burning, sacking, and blowing people up, in order,\r\nby alarming the timid, to head off any real reforms. What astonishes\r\nme most is that you should have fallen into the trap so\r\nunsuspectingly."\r\n\r\n"What are your grounds for believing that the red flag party was\r\nsubsidized?" I inquired.\r\n\r\n"Why simply because they must have seen that their course made a\r\nthousand enemies of their professed cause to one friend. Not to\r\nsuppose that they were hired for the work is to credit them with an\r\ninconceivable folly.[4] In the United States, of all countries, no\r\nparty could intelligently expect to carry its point without first\r\nwinning over to its ideas a majority of the nation, as the national\r\nparty eventually did."\r\n\r\n"The national party!" I exclaimed. "That must have arisen after my\r\nday. I suppose it was one of the labor parties."\r\n\r\n"Oh no!" replied the doctor. "The labor parties, as such, never could\r\nhave accomplished anything on a large or permanent scale. For purposes\r\nof national scope, their basis as merely class organizations was too\r\nnarrow. It was not till a rearrangement of the industrial and social\r\nsystem on a higher ethical basis, and for the more efficient\r\nproduction of wealth, was recognized as the interest, not of one\r\nclass, but equally of all classes, of rich and poor, cultured and\r\nignorant, old and young, weak and strong, men and women, that there\r\nwas any prospect that it would be achieved. Then the national party\r\narose to carry it out by political methods. It probably took that name\r\nbecause its aim was to nationalize the functions of production and\r\ndistribution. Indeed, it could not well have had any other name, for\r\nits purpose was to realize the idea of the nation with a grandeur and\r\ncompleteness never before conceived, not as an association of men for\r\ncertain merely political functions affecting their happiness only\r\nremotely and superficially, but as a family, a vital union, a common\r\nlife, a mighty heaven-touching tree whose leaves are its people, fed\r\nfrom its veins, and feeding it in turn. The most patriotic of all\r\npossible parties, it sought to justify patriotism and raise it from\r\nan instinct to a rational devotion, by making the native land truly a\r\nfather land, a father who kept the people alive and was not merely an\r\nidol for which they were expected to die."\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: I fully admit the difficulty of accounting for the course\r\nof the anarchists on any other theory than that they were subsidized\r\nby the capitalists, but, at the same time, there is no doubt that the\r\ntheory is wholly erroneous. It certainly was not held at the time by\r\nany one, though it may seem so obvious in the retrospect.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe personality of Edith Leete had naturally impressed me strongly\r\never since I had come, in so strange a manner, to be an inmate of her\r\nfather\'s house, and it was to be expected that after what had happened\r\nthe night previous, I should be more than ever preoccupied with\r\nthoughts of her. From the first I had been struck with the air of\r\nserene frankness and ingenuous directness, more like that of a noble\r\nand innocent boy than any girl I had ever known, which characterized\r\nher. I was curious to know how far this charming quality might be\r\npeculiar to herself, and how far possibly a result of alterations in\r\nthe social position of women which might have taken place since my\r\ntime. Finding an opportunity that day, when alone with Dr. Leete, I\r\nturned the conversation in that direction.\r\n\r\n"I suppose," I said, "that women nowadays, having been relieved of the\r\nburden of housework, have no employment but the cultivation of their\r\ncharms and graces."\r\n\r\n"So far as we men are concerned," replied Dr. Leete, "we should\r\nconsider that they amply paid their way, to use one of your forms of\r\nexpression, if they confined themselves to that occupation, but you\r\nmay be very sure that they have quite too much spirit to consent to be\r\nmere beneficiaries of society, even as a return for ornamenting it.\r\nThey did, indeed, welcome their riddance from housework, because that\r\nwas not only exceptionally wearing in itself, but also wasteful, in\r\nthe extreme, of energy, as compared with the cooperative plan; but\r\nthey accepted relief from that sort of work only that they might\r\ncontribute in other and more effectual, as well as more agreeable,\r\nways to the common weal. Our women, as well as our men, are members of\r\nthe industrial army, and leave it only when maternal duties claim\r\nthem. The result is that most women, at one time or another of their\r\nlives, serve industrially some five or ten or fifteen years, while\r\nthose who have no children fill out the full term."\r\n\r\n"A woman does not, then, necessarily leave the industrial service on\r\nmarriage?" I queried.\r\n\r\n"No more than a man," replied the doctor. "Why on earth should she?\r\nMarried women have no housekeeping responsibilities now, you know, and\r\na husband is not a baby that he should be cared for."\r\n\r\n"It was thought one of the most grievous features of our civilization\r\nthat we required so much toil from women," I said; "but it seems to me\r\nyou get more out of them than we did."\r\n\r\nDr. Leete laughed. "Indeed we do, just as we do out of our men. Yet\r\nthe women of this age are very happy, and those of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, unless contemporary references greatly mislead us, were very\r\nmiserable. The reason that women nowadays are so much more efficient\r\nco-laborers with the men, and at the same time are so happy, is that,\r\nin regard to their work as well as men\'s, we follow the principle of\r\nproviding every one the kind of occupation he or she is best adapted\r\nto. Women being inferior in strength to men, and further disqualified\r\nindustrially in special ways, the kinds of occupation reserved for\r\nthem, and the conditions under which they pursue them, have reference\r\nto these facts. The heavier sorts of work are everywhere reserved for\r\nmen, the lighter occupations for women. Under no circumstances is a\r\nwoman permitted to follow any employment not perfectly adapted, both\r\nas to kind and degree of labor, to her sex. Moreover, the hours of\r\nwomen\'s work are considerably shorter than those of men\'s, more\r\nfrequent vacations are granted, and the most careful provision is made\r\nfor rest when needed. The men of this day so well appreciate that they\r\nowe to the beauty and grace of women the chief zest of their lives and\r\ntheir main incentive to effort, that they permit them to work at all\r\nonly because it is fully understood that a certain regular requirement\r\nof labor, of a sort adapted to their powers, is well for body and\r\nmind, during the period of maximum physical vigor. We believe that\r\nthe magnificent health which distinguishes our women from those of\r\nyour day, who seem to have been so generally sickly, is owing largely\r\nto the fact that all alike are furnished with healthful and\r\ninspiriting occupation."\r\n\r\n"I understood you," I said, "that the women-workers belong to the army\r\nof industry, but how can they be under the same system of ranking and\r\ndiscipline with the men, when the conditions of their labor are so\r\ndifferent."\r\n\r\n"They are under an entirely different discipline," replied Dr. Leete,\r\n"and constitute rather an allied force than an integral part of the\r\narmy of the men. They have a woman general-in-chief and are under\r\nexclusively feminine regime. This general, as also the higher\r\nofficers, is chosen by the body of women who have passed the time of\r\nservice, in correspondence with the manner in which the chiefs of the\r\nmasculine army and the President of the nation are elected. The\r\ngeneral of the women\'s army sits in the cabinet of the President and\r\nhas a veto on measures respecting women\'s work, pending appeals to\r\nCongress. I should have said, in speaking of the judiciary, that we\r\nhave women on the bench, appointed by the general of the women, as\r\nwell as men. Causes in which both parties are women are determined by\r\nwomen judges, and where a man and a woman are parties to a case, a\r\njudge of either sex must consent to the verdict."\r\n\r\n"Womanhood seems to be organized as a sort of _imperium in imperio_ in\r\nyour system," I said.\r\n\r\n"To some extent," Dr. Leete replied; "but the inner _imperium_ is one\r\nfrom which you will admit there is not likely to be much danger to the\r\nnation. The lack of some such recognition of the distinct\r\nindividuality of the sexes was one of the innumerable defects of your\r\nsociety. The passional attraction between men and women has too often\r\nprevented a perception of the profound differences which make the\r\nmembers of each sex in many things strange to the other, and capable\r\nof sympathy only with their own. It is in giving full play to the\r\ndifferences of sex rather than in seeking to obliterate them, as was\r\napparently the effort of some reformers in your day, that the\r\nenjoyment of each by itself and the piquancy which each has for the\r\nother, are alike enhanced. In your day there was no career for women\r\nexcept in an unnatural rivalry with men. We have given them a world of\r\ntheir own, with its emulations, ambitions, and careers, and I assure\r\nyou they are very happy in it. It seems to us that women were more\r\nthan any other class the victims of your civilization. There is\r\nsomething which, even at this distance of time, penetrates one with\r\npathos in the spectacle of their ennuied, undeveloped lives, stunted\r\nat marriage, their narrow horizon, bounded so often, physically, by\r\nthe four walls of home, and morally by a petty circle of personal\r\ninterests. I speak now, not of the poorer classes, who were generally\r\nworked to death, but also of the well-to-do and rich. From the great\r\nsorrows, as well as the petty frets of life, they had no refuge in the\r\nbreezy outdoor world of human affairs, nor any interests save those of\r\nthe family. Such an existence would have softened men\'s brains or\r\ndriven them mad. All that is changed to-day. No woman is heard\r\nnowadays wishing she were a man, nor parents desiring boy rather than\r\ngirl children. Our girls are as full of ambition for their careers as\r\nour boys. Marriage, when it comes, does not mean incarceration for\r\nthem, nor does it separate them in any way from the larger interests\r\nof society, the bustling life of the world. Only when maternity fills\r\na woman\'s mind with new interests does she withdraw from the world for\r\na time. Afterwards, and at any time, she may return to her place among\r\nher comrades, nor need she ever lose touch with them. Women are a very\r\nhappy race nowadays, as compared with what they ever were before in\r\nthe world\'s history, and their power of giving happiness to men has\r\nbeen of course increased in proportion."\r\n\r\n"I should imagine it possible," I said, "that the interest which girls\r\ntake in their careers as members of the industrial army and candidates\r\nfor its distinctions might have an effect to deter them from\r\nmarriage."\r\n\r\nDr. Leete smiled. "Have no anxiety on that score, Mr. West," he\r\nreplied. "The Creator took very good care that whatever other\r\nmodifications the dispositions of men and women might with time take\r\non, their attraction for each other should remain constant. The mere\r\nfact that in an age like yours, when the struggle for existence must\r\nhave left people little time for other thoughts, and the future was so\r\nuncertain that to assume parental responsibilities must have often\r\nseemed like a criminal risk, there was even then marrying and giving\r\nin marriage, should be conclusive on this point. As for love nowadays,\r\none of our authors says that the vacuum left in the minds of men and\r\nwomen by the absence of care for one\'s livelihood has been entirely\r\ntaken up by the tender passion. That, however, I beg you to believe,\r\nis something of an exaggeration. For the rest, so far is marriage from\r\nbeing an interference with a woman\'s career, that the higher positions\r\nin the feminine army of industry are intrusted only to women who have\r\nbeen both wives and mothers, as they alone fully represent their sex."\r\n\r\n"Are credit cards issued to the women just as to the men?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\n"The credits of the women, I suppose, are for smaller sums, owing to\r\nthe frequent suspension of their labor on account of family\r\nresponsibilities."\r\n\r\n"Smaller!" exclaimed Dr. Leete, "oh, no! The maintenance of all our\r\npeople is the same. There are no exceptions to that rule, but if any\r\ndifference were made on account of the interruptions you speak of, it\r\nwould be by making the woman\'s credit larger, not smaller. Can you\r\nthink of any service constituting a stronger claim on the nation\'s\r\ngratitude than bearing and nursing the nation\'s children? According to\r\nour view, none deserve so well of the world as good parents. There is\r\nno task so unselfish, so necessarily without return, though the heart\r\nis well rewarded, as the nurture of the children who are to make the\r\nworld for one another when we are gone."\r\n\r\n"It would seem to follow, from what you have said, that wives are in\r\nno way dependent on their husbands for maintenance."\r\n\r\n"Of course they are not," replied Dr. Leete, "nor children on their\r\nparents either, that is, for means of support, though of course they\r\nare for the offices of affection. The child\'s labor, when he grows up,\r\nwill go to increase the common stock, not his parents\', who will be\r\ndead, and therefore he is properly nurtured out of the common stock.\r\nThe account of every person, man, woman, and child, you must\r\nunderstand, is always with the nation directly, and never through any\r\nintermediary, except, of course, that parents, to a certain extent,\r\nact for children as their guardians. You see that it is by virtue of\r\nthe relation of individuals to the nation, of their membership in it,\r\nthat they are entitled to support; and this title is in no way\r\nconnected with or affected by their relations to other individuals who\r\nare fellow members of the nation with them. That any person should be\r\ndependent for the means of support upon another would be shocking to\r\nthe moral sense as well as indefensible on any rational social theory.\r\nWhat would become of personal liberty and dignity under such an\r\narrangement? I am aware that you called yourselves free in the\r\nnineteenth century. The meaning of the word could not then, however,\r\nhave been at all what it is at present, or you certainly would not\r\nhave applied it to a society of which nearly every member was in a\r\nposition of galling personal dependence upon others as to the very\r\nmeans of life, the poor upon the rich, or employed upon employer,\r\nwomen upon men, children upon parents. Instead of distributing the\r\nproduct of the nation directly to its members, which would seem the\r\nmost natural and obvious method, it would actually appear that you had\r\ngiven your minds to devising a plan of hand to hand distribution,\r\ninvolving the maximum of personal humiliation to all classes of\r\nrecipients.\r\n\r\n"As regards the dependence of women upon men for support, which then\r\nwas usual, of course, natural attraction in case of marriages of love\r\nmust often have made it endurable, though for spirited women I should\r\nfancy it must always have remained humiliating. What, then, must it\r\nhave been in the innumerable cases where women, with or without the\r\nform of marriage, had to sell themselves to men to get their living?\r\nEven your contemporaries, callous as they were to most of the\r\nrevolting aspects of their society, seem to have had an idea that this\r\nwas not quite as it should be; but, it was still only for pity\'s sake\r\nthat they deplored the lot of the women. It did not occur to them that\r\nit was robbery as well as cruelty when men seized for themselves the\r\nwhole product of the world and left women to beg and wheedle for their\r\nshare. Why--but bless me, Mr. West, I am really running on at a\r\nremarkable rate, just as if the robbery, the sorrow, and the shame\r\nwhich those poor women endured were not over a century since, or as if\r\nyou were responsible for what you no doubt deplored as much as I do."\r\n\r\n"I must bear my share of responsibility for the world as it then was,"\r\nI replied. "All I can say in extenuation is that until the nation was\r\nripe for the present system of organized production and distribution,\r\nno radical improvement in the position of woman was possible. The root\r\nof her disability, as you say, was her personal dependence upon man\r\nfor her livelihood, and I can imagine no other mode of social\r\norganization than that you have adopted, which would have set woman\r\nfree of man at the same time that it set men free of one another. I\r\nsuppose, by the way, that so entire a change in the position of women\r\ncannot have taken place without affecting in marked ways the social\r\nrelations of the sexes. That will be a very interesting study for me."\r\n\r\n"The change you will observe," said Dr. Leete, "will chiefly be, I\r\nthink, the entire frankness and unconstraint which now characterizes\r\nthose relations, as compared with the artificiality which seems to\r\nhave marked them in your time. The sexes now meet with the ease of\r\nperfect equals, suitors to each other for nothing but love. In your\r\ntime the fact that women were dependent for support on men made the\r\nwoman in reality the one chiefly benefited by marriage. This fact, so\r\nfar as we can judge from contemporary records, appears to have been\r\ncoarsely enough recognized among the lower classes, while among the\r\nmore polished it was glossed over by a system of elaborate\r\nconventionalities which aimed to carry the precisely opposite meaning,\r\nnamely, that the man was the party chiefly benefited. To keep up this\r\nconvention it was essential that he should always seem the suitor.\r\nNothing was therefore considered more shocking to the proprieties than\r\nthat a woman should betray a fondness for a man before he had\r\nindicated a desire to marry her. Why, we actually have in our\r\nlibraries books, by authors of your day, written for no other purpose\r\nthan to discuss the question whether, under any conceivable\r\ncircumstances, a woman might, without discredit to her sex, reveal an\r\nunsolicited love. All this seems exquisitely absurd to us, and yet we\r\nknow that, given your circumstances, the problem might have a serious\r\nside. When for a woman to proffer her love to a man was in effect to\r\ninvite him to assume the burden of her support, it is easy to see that\r\npride and delicacy might well have checked the promptings of the\r\nheart. When you go out into our society, Mr. West, you must be\r\nprepared to be often cross-questioned on this point by our young\r\npeople, who are naturally much interested in this aspect of\r\nold-fashioned manners".[5]\r\n\r\n"And so the girls of the twentieth century tell their love."\r\n\r\n"If they choose," replied Dr. Leete. "There is no more pretense of a\r\nconcealment of feeling on their part than on the part of their lovers.\r\nCoquetry would be as much despised in a girl as in a man. Affected\r\ncoldness, which in your day rarely deceived a lover, would deceive him\r\nwholly now, for no one thinks of practicing it."\r\n\r\n"One result which must follow from the independence of women I can see\r\nfor myself," I said. "There can be no marriages now except those of\r\ninclination."\r\n\r\n"That is a matter of course," replied Dr. Leete.\r\n\r\n"Think of a world in which there are nothing but matches of pure love!\r\nAh me, Dr. Leete, how far you are from being able to understand what\r\nan astonishing phenomenon such a world seems to a man of the\r\nnineteenth century!"\r\n\r\n"I can, however, to some extent, imagine it," replied the doctor. "But\r\nthe fact you celebrate, that there are nothing but love matches, means\r\neven more, perhaps, than you probably at first realize. It means that\r\nfor the first time in human history the principle of sexual selection,\r\nwith its tendency to preserve and transmit the better types of the\r\nrace, and let the inferior types drop out, has unhindered operation.\r\nThe necessities of poverty, the need of having a home, no longer tempt\r\nwomen to accept as the fathers of their children men whom they neither\r\ncan love nor respect. Wealth and rank no longer divert attention from\r\npersonal qualities. Gold no longer \'gilds the straitened forehead of\r\nthe fool.\' The gifts of person, mind, and disposition; beauty, wit,\r\neloquence, kindness, generosity, geniality, courage, are sure of\r\ntransmission to posterity. Every generation is sifted through a little\r\nfiner mesh than the last. The attributes that human nature admires are\r\npreserved, those that repel it are left behind. There are, of course,\r\na great many women who with love must mingle admiration, and seek to\r\nwed greatly, but these not the less obey the same law, for to wed\r\ngreatly now is not to marry men of fortune or title, but those who\r\nhave risen above their fellows by the solidity or brilliance of their\r\nservices to humanity. These form nowadays the only aristocracy with\r\nwhich alliance is distinction.\r\n\r\n"You were speaking, a day or two ago, of the physical superiority of\r\nour people to your contemporaries. Perhaps more important than any of\r\nthe causes I mentioned then as tending to race purification has been\r\nthe effect of untrammeled sexual selection upon the quality of two or\r\nthree successive generations. I believe that when you have made a\r\nfuller study of our people you will find in them not only a physical,\r\nbut a mental and moral improvement. It would be strange if it were not\r\nso, for not only is one of the great laws of nature now freely working\r\nout the salvation of the race, but a profound moral sentiment has come\r\nto its support. Individualism, which in your day was the animating\r\nidea of society, not only was fatal to any vital sentiment of\r\nbrotherhood and common interest among living men, but equally to any\r\nrealization of the responsibility of the living for the generation to\r\nfollow. To-day this sense of responsibility, practically unrecognized\r\nin all previous ages, has become one of the great ethical ideas of the\r\nrace, reinforcing, with an intense conviction of duty, the natural\r\nimpulse to seek in marriage the best and noblest of the other sex. The\r\nresult is, that not all the encouragements and incentives of every\r\nsort which we have provided to develop industry, talent, genius,\r\nexcellence of whatever kind, are comparable in their effect on our\r\nyoung men with the fact that our women sit aloft as judges of the\r\nrace and reserve themselves to reward the winners. Of all the whips,\r\nand spurs, and baits, and prizes, there is none like the thought of\r\nthe radiant faces which the laggards will find averted.\r\n\r\n"Celibates nowadays are almost invariably men who have failed to\r\nacquit themselves creditably in the work of life. The woman must be a\r\ncourageous one, with a very evil sort of courage, too, whom pity for\r\none of these unfortunates should lead to defy the opinion of her\r\ngeneration--for otherwise she is free--so far as to accept him for a\r\nhusband. I should add that, more exacting and difficult to resist than\r\nany other element in that opinion, she would find the sentiment of her\r\nown sex. Our women have risen to the full height of their\r\nresponsibility as the wardens of the world to come, to whose keeping\r\nthe keys of the future are confided. Their feeling of duty in this\r\nrespect amounts to a sense of religious consecration. It is a cult in\r\nwhich they educate their daughters from childhood."\r\n\r\nAfter going to my room that night, I sat up late to read a romance of\r\nBerrian, handed me by Dr. Leete, the plot of which turned on a\r\nsituation suggested by his last words, concerning the modern view of\r\nparental responsibility. A similar situation would almost certainly\r\nhave been treated by a nineteenth century romancist so as to excite\r\nthe morbid sympathy of the reader with the sentimental selfishness of\r\nthe lovers, and his resentment toward the unwritten law which they\r\noutraged. I need not describe--for who has not read "Ruth Elton?"--how\r\ndifferent is the course which Berrian takes, and with what tremendous\r\neffect he enforces the principle which he states: "Over the unborn our\r\npower is that of God, and our responsibility like His toward us. As we\r\nacquit ourselves toward them, so let Him deal with us."\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: I may say that Dr. Leete\'s warning has been fully\r\njustified by my experience. The amount and intensity of amusement\r\nwhich the young people of this day, and the young women especially,\r\nare able to extract from what they are pleased to call the oddities of\r\ncourtship in the nineteenth century, appear unlimited.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think if a person were ever excusable for losing track of the days\r\nof the week, the circumstances excused me. Indeed, if I had been told\r\nthat the method of reckoning time had been wholly changed and the days\r\nwere now counted in lots of five, ten, or fifteen instead of seven, I\r\nshould have been in no way surprised after what I had already heard\r\nand seen of the twentieth century. The first time that any inquiry as\r\nto the days of the week occurred to me was the morning following the\r\nconversation related in the last chapter. At the breakfast table Dr.\r\nLeete asked me if I would care to hear a sermon.\r\n\r\n"Is it Sunday, then?" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he replied. "It was on Friday, you see, when we made the lucky\r\ndiscovery of the buried chamber to which we owe your society this\r\nmorning. It was on Saturday morning, soon after midnight, that you\r\nfirst awoke, and Sunday afternoon when you awoke the second time with\r\nfaculties fully regained."\r\n\r\n"So you still have Sundays and sermons," I said. "We had prophets who\r\nforetold that long before this time the world would have dispensed\r\nwith both. I am very curious to know how the ecclesiastical systems\r\nfit in with the rest of your social arrangements. I suppose you have a\r\nsort of national church with official clergymen."\r\n\r\nDr. Leete laughed, and Mrs. Leete and Edith seemed greatly amused.\r\n\r\n"Why, Mr. West," Edith said, "what odd people you must think us. You\r\nwere quite done with national religious establishments in the\r\nnineteenth century, and did you fancy we had gone back to them?"\r\n\r\n"But how can voluntary churches and an unofficial clerical profession\r\nbe reconciled with national ownership of all buildings, and the\r\nindustrial service required of all men?" I answered.\r\n\r\n"The religious practices of the people have naturally changed\r\nconsiderably in a century," replied Dr. Leete; "but supposing them to\r\nhave remained unchanged, our social system would accommodate them\r\nperfectly. The nation supplies any person or number of persons with\r\nbuildings on guarantee of the rent, and they remain tenants while they\r\npay it. As for the clergymen, if a number of persons wish the services\r\nof an individual for any particular end of their own, apart from the\r\ngeneral service of the nation, they can always secure it, with that\r\nindividual\'s own consent, of course, just as we secure the service of\r\nour editors, by contributing from their credit-cards an indemnity to\r\nthe nation for the loss of his services in general industry. This\r\nindemnity paid the nation for the individual answers to the salary in\r\nyour day paid to the individual himself; and the various applications\r\nof this principle leave private initiative full play in all details to\r\nwhich national control is not applicable. Now, as to hearing a sermon\r\nto-day, if you wish to do so, you can either go to a church to hear it\r\nor stay at home."\r\n\r\n"How am I to hear it if I stay at home?"\r\n\r\n"Simply by accompanying us to the music room at the proper hour and\r\nselecting an easy chair. There are some who still prefer to hear\r\nsermons in church, but most of our preaching, like our musical\r\nperformances, is not in public, but delivered in acoustically prepared\r\nchambers, connected by wire with subscribers\' houses. If you prefer to\r\ngo to a church I shall be glad to accompany you, but I really don\'t\r\nbelieve you are likely to hear anywhere a better discourse than you\r\nwill at home. I see by the paper that Mr. Barton is to preach this\r\nmorning, and he preaches only by telephone, and to audiences often\r\nreaching 150,000."\r\n\r\n"The novelty of the experience of hearing a sermon under such\r\ncircumstances would incline me to be one of Mr. Barton\'s hearers, if\r\nfor no other reason," I said.\r\n\r\nAn hour or two later, as I sat reading in the library, Edith came for\r\nme, and I followed her to the music room, where Dr. and Mrs. Leete\r\nwere waiting. We had not more than seated ourselves comfortably when\r\nthe tinkle of a bell was heard, and a few moments after the voice of a\r\nman, at the pitch of ordinary conversation, addressed us, with an\r\neffect of proceeding from an invisible person in the room. This was\r\nwhat the voice said:--\r\n\r\nMR. BARTON\'S SERMON.\r\n\r\n"We have had among us, during the past week, a critic from the\r\nnineteenth century, a living representative of the epoch of our\r\ngreat-grandparents. It would be strange if a fact so extraordinary had\r\nnot somewhat strongly affected our imaginations. Perhaps most of us\r\nhave been stimulated to some effort to realize the society of a\r\ncentury ago, and figure to ourselves what it must have been like to\r\nlive then. In inviting you now to consider certain reflections upon\r\nthis subject which have occurred to me, I presume that I shall rather\r\nfollow than divert the course of your own thoughts."\r\n\r\n\r\nEdith whispered something to her father at this point, to which he\r\nnodded assent and turned to me.\r\n\r\n"Mr. West," he said, "Edith suggests that you may find it slightly\r\nembarrassing to listen to a discourse on the lines Mr. Barton is\r\nlaying down, and if so, you need not be cheated out of a sermon. She\r\nwill connect us with Mr. Sweetser\'s speaking room if you say so, and I\r\ncan still promise you a very good discourse."\r\n\r\n"No, no," I said. "Believe me, I would much rather hear what Mr.\r\nBarton has to say."\r\n\r\n"As you please," replied my host.\r\n\r\nWhen her father spoke to me Edith had touched a screw, and the voice\r\nof Mr. Barton had ceased abruptly. Now at another touch the room was\r\nonce more filled with the earnest sympathetic tones which had already\r\nimpressed me most favorably.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\n"I venture to assume that one effect has been common with us as a\r\nresult of this effort at retrospection, and that it has been to leave\r\nus more than ever amazed at the stupendous change which one brief\r\ncentury has made in the material and moral conditions of humanity.\r\n\r\n"Still, as regards the contrast between the poverty of the nation and\r\nthe world in the nineteenth century and their wealth now, it is not\r\ngreater, possibly, than had been before seen in human history, perhaps\r\nnot greater, for example, than that between the poverty of this\r\ncountry during the earliest colonial period of the seventeenth century\r\nand the relatively great wealth it had attained at the close of the\r\nnineteenth, or between the England of William the Conqueror and that\r\nof Victoria. Although the aggregate riches of a nation did not then,\r\nas now, afford any accurate criterion of the masses of its people, yet\r\ninstances like these afford partial parallels for the merely material\r\nside of the contrast between the nineteenth and the twentieth\r\ncenturies. It is when we contemplate the moral aspect of that contrast\r\nthat we find ourselves in the presence of a phenomenon for which\r\nhistory offers no precedent, however far back we may cast our eye. One\r\nmight almost be excused who should exclaim, \'Here, surely, is\r\nsomething like a miracle!\' Nevertheless, when we give over idle\r\nwonder, and begin to examine the seeming prodigy critically, we find\r\nit no prodigy at all, much less a miracle. It is not necessary to\r\nsuppose a moral new birth of humanity, or a wholesale destruction of\r\nthe wicked and survival of the good, to account for the fact before\r\nus. It finds its simple and obvious explanation in the reaction of a\r\nchanged environment upon human nature. It means merely that a form of\r\nsociety which was founded on the pseudo self-interest of selfishness,\r\nand appealed solely to the anti-social and brutal side of human\r\nnature, has been replaced by institutions based on the true\r\nself-interest of a rational unselfishness, and appealing to the social\r\nand generous instincts of men.\r\n\r\n"My friends, if you would see men again the beasts of prey they seemed\r\nin the nineteenth century, all you have to do is to restore the old\r\nsocial and industrial system, which taught them to view their natural\r\nprey in their fellow-men, and find their gain in the loss of others.\r\nNo doubt it seems to you that no necessity, however dire, would have\r\ntempted you to subsist on what superior skill or strength enabled you\r\nto wrest from others equally needy. But suppose it were not merely\r\nyour own life that you were responsible for. I know well that there\r\nmust have been many a man among our ancestors who, if it had been\r\nmerely a question of his own life, would sooner have given it up than\r\nnourished it by bread snatched from others. But this he was not\r\npermitted to do. He had dear lives dependent on him. Men loved women\r\nin those days, as now. God knows how they dared be fathers, but they\r\nhad babies as sweet, no doubt, to them as ours to us, whom they must\r\nfeed, clothe, educate. The gentlest creatures are fierce when they\r\nhave young to provide for, and in that wolfish society the struggle\r\nfor bread borrowed a peculiar desperation from the tenderest\r\nsentiments. For the sake of those dependent on him, a man might not\r\nchoose, but must plunge into the foul fight,--cheat, overreach,\r\nsupplant, defraud, buy below worth and sell above, break down the\r\nbusiness by which his neighbor fed his young ones, tempt men to buy\r\nwhat they ought not and to sell what they should not, grind his\r\nlaborers, sweat his debtors, cozen his creditors. Though a man sought\r\nit carefully with tears, it was hard to find a way in which he could\r\nearn a living and provide for his family except by pressing in before\r\nsome weaker rival and taking the food from his mouth. Even the\r\nministers of religion were not exempt from this cruel necessity. While\r\nthey warned their flocks against the love of money, regard for their\r\nfamilies compelled them to keep an outlook for the pecuniary prizes of\r\ntheir calling. Poor fellows, theirs was indeed a trying business,\r\npreaching to men a generosity and unselfishness which they and\r\neverybody knew would, in the existing state of the world, reduce to\r\npoverty those who should practice them, laying down laws of conduct\r\nwhich the law of self-preservation compelled men to break. Looking on\r\nthe inhuman spectacle of society, these worthy men bitterly bemoaned\r\nthe depravity of human nature; as if angelic nature would not have\r\nbeen debauched in such a devil\'s school! Ah, my friends, believe me,\r\nit is not now in this happy age that humanity is proving the divinity\r\nwithin it. It was rather in those evil days when not even the fight\r\nfor life with one another, the struggle for mere existence, in which\r\nmercy was folly, could wholly banish generosity and kindness from the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n"It is not hard to understand the desperation with which men and\r\nwomen, who under other conditions would have been full of gentleness\r\nand ruth, fought and tore each other in the scramble for gold, when we\r\nrealize what it meant to miss it, what poverty was in that day. For\r\nthe body it was hunger and thirst, torment by heat and frost, in\r\nsickness neglect, in health unremitting toil; for the moral nature it\r\nmeant oppression, contempt, and the patient endurance of indignity,\r\nbrutish associations from infancy, the loss of all the innocence of\r\nchildhood, the grace of womanhood, the dignity of manhood; for the\r\nmind it meant the death of ignorance, the torpor of all those\r\nfaculties which distinguish us from brutes, the reduction of life to a\r\nround of bodily functions.\r\n\r\n"Ah, my friends, if such a fate as this were offered you and your\r\nchildren as the only alternative of success in the accumulation of\r\nwealth, how long do you fancy would you be in sinking to the moral\r\nlevel of your ancestors?\r\n\r\n"Some two or three centuries ago an act of barbarity was committed in\r\nIndia, which, though the number of lives destroyed was but a few\r\nscore, was attended by such peculiar horrors that its memory is likely\r\nto be perpetual. A number of English prisoners were shut up in a room\r\ncontaining not enough air to supply one-tenth their number. The\r\nunfortunates were gallant men, devoted comrades in service, but, as\r\nthe agonies of suffocation began to take hold on them, they forgot all\r\nelse, and became involved in a hideous struggle, each one for himself,\r\nand against all others, to force a way to one of the small apertures\r\nof the prison at which alone it was possible to get a breath of air.\r\nIt was a struggle in which men became beasts, and the recital of its\r\nhorrors by the few survivors so shocked our forefathers that for a\r\ncentury later we find it a stock reference in their literature as a\r\ntypical illustration of the extreme possibilities of human misery, as\r\nshocking in its moral as its physical aspect. They could scarcely have\r\nanticipated that to us the Black Hole of Calcutta, with its press of\r\nmaddened men tearing and trampling one another in the struggle to win\r\na place at the breathing holes, would seem a striking type of the\r\nsociety of their age. It lacked something of being a complete type,\r\nhowever, for in the Calcutta Black Hole there were no tender women, no\r\nlittle children and old men and women, no cripples. They were at least\r\nall men, strong to bear, who suffered.\r\n\r\n"When we reflect that the ancient order of which I have been speaking\r\nwas prevalent up to the end of the nineteenth century, while to us the\r\nnew order which succeeded it already seems antique, even our parents\r\nhaving known no other, we cannot fail to be astounded at the\r\nsuddenness with which a transition so profound beyond all previous\r\nexperience of the race must have been effected. Some observation of\r\nthe state of men\'s minds during the last quarter of the nineteenth\r\ncentury will, however, in great measure, dissipate this astonishment.\r\nThough general intelligence in the modern sense could not be said to\r\nexist in any community at that time, yet, as compared with previous\r\ngenerations, the one then on the stage was intelligent. The inevitable\r\nconsequence of even this comparative degree of intelligence had been a\r\nperception of the evils of society, such as had never before been\r\ngeneral. It is quite true that these evils had been even worse, much\r\nworse, in previous ages. It was the increased intelligence of the\r\nmasses which made the difference, as the dawn reveals the squalor of\r\nsurroundings which in the darkness may have seemed tolerable. The\r\nkeynote of the literature of the period was one of compassion for the\r\npoor and unfortunate, and indignant outcry against the failure of the\r\nsocial machinery to ameliorate the miseries of men. It is plain from\r\nthese outbursts that the moral hideousness of the spectacle about them\r\nwas, at least by flashes, fully realized by the best of the men of\r\nthat time, and that the lives of some of the more sensitive and\r\ngenerous hearted of them were rendered wellnigh unendurable by the\r\nintensity of their sympathies.\r\n\r\n"Although the idea of the vital unity of the family of mankind, the\r\nreality of human brotherhood, was very far from being apprehended by\r\nthem as the moral axiom it seems to us, yet it is a mistake to suppose\r\nthat there was no feeling at all corresponding to it. I could read you\r\npassages of great beauty from some of their writers which show that\r\nthe conception was clearly attained by a few, and no doubt vaguely by\r\nmany more. Moreover, it must not be forgotten that the nineteenth\r\ncentury was in name Christian, and the fact that the entire commercial\r\nand industrial frame of society was the embodiment of the\r\nanti-Christian spirit must have had some weight, though I admit it was\r\nstrangely little, with the nominal followers of Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n"When we inquire why it did not have more, why, in general, long after\r\na vast majority of men had agreed as to the crying abuses of the\r\nexisting social arrangement, they still tolerated it, or contented\r\nthemselves with talking of petty reforms in it, we come upon an\r\nextraordinary fact. It was the sincere belief of even the best of men\r\nat that epoch that the only stable elements in human nature, on which\r\na social system could be safely founded, were its worst propensities.\r\nThey had been taught and believed that greed and self-seeking were all\r\nthat held mankind together, and that all human associations would fall\r\nto pieces if anything were done to blunt the edge of these motives or\r\ncurb their operation. In a word, they believed--even those who longed\r\nto believe otherwise--the exact reverse of what seems to us\r\nself-evident; they believed, that is, that the anti-social qualities\r\nof men, and not their social qualities, were what furnished the\r\ncohesive force of society. It seemed reasonable to them that men lived\r\ntogether solely for the purpose of overreaching and oppressing one\r\nanother, and of being overreached and oppressed, and that while a\r\nsociety that gave full scope to these propensities could stand, there\r\nwould be little chance for one based on the idea of cooperation for\r\nthe benefit of all. It seems absurd to expect any one to believe that\r\nconvictions like these were ever seriously entertained by men; but\r\nthat they were not only entertained by our great-grandfathers, but\r\nwere responsible for the long delay in doing away with the ancient\r\norder, after a conviction of its intolerable abuses had become\r\ngeneral, is as well established as any fact in history can be. Just\r\nhere you will find the explanation of the profound pessimism of the\r\nliterature of the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the note of\r\nmelancholy in its poetry, and the cynicism of its humor.\r\n\r\n"Feeling that the condition of the race was unendurable, they had no\r\nclear hope of anything better. They believed that the evolution of\r\nhumanity had resulted in leading it into a _cul de sac_, and that\r\nthere was no way of getting forward. The frame of men\'s minds at this\r\ntime is strikingly illustrated by treatises which have come down to\r\nus, and may even now be consulted in our libraries by the curious, in\r\nwhich laborious arguments are pursued to prove that despite the evil\r\nplight of men, life was still, by some slight preponderance of\r\nconsiderations, probably better worth living than leaving. Despising\r\nthemselves, they despised their Creator. There was a general decay of\r\nreligious belief. Pale and watery gleams, from skies thickly veiled by\r\ndoubt and dread, alone lighted up the chaos of earth. That men should\r\ndoubt Him whose breath is in their nostrils, or dread the hands that\r\nmoulded them, seems to us indeed a pitiable insanity; but we must\r\nremember that children who are brave by day have sometimes foolish\r\nfears at night. The dawn has come since then. It is very easy to\r\nbelieve in the fatherhood of God in the twentieth century.\r\n\r\n"Briefly, as must needs be in a discourse of this character, I have\r\nadverted to some of the causes which had prepared men\'s minds for the\r\nchange from the old to the new order, as well as some causes of the\r\nconservatism of despair which for a while held it back after the time\r\nwas ripe. To wonder at the rapidity with which the change was\r\ncompleted after its possibility was first entertained is to forget the\r\nintoxicating effect of hope upon minds long accustomed to despair. The\r\nsunburst, after so long and dark a night, must needs have had a\r\ndazzling effect. From the moment men allowed themselves to believe\r\nthat humanity after all had not been meant for a dwarf, that its squat\r\nstature was not the measure of its possible growth, but that it stood\r\nupon the verge of an avatar of limitless development, the reaction\r\nmust needs have been overwhelming. It is evident that nothing was able\r\nto stand against the enthusiasm which the new faith inspired.\r\n\r\n"Here, at last, men must have felt, was a cause compared with which\r\nthe grandest of historic causes had been trivial. It was doubtless\r\nbecause it could have commanded millions of martyrs, that none were\r\nneeded. The change of a dynasty in a petty kingdom of the old world\r\noften cost more lives than did the revolution which set the feet of\r\nthe human race at last in the right way.\r\n\r\n"Doubtless it ill beseems one to whom the boon of life in our\r\nresplendent age has been vouchsafed to wish his destiny other, and yet\r\nI have often thought that I would fain exchange my share in this\r\nserene and golden day for a place in that stormy epoch of transition,\r\nwhen heroes burst the barred gate of the future and revealed to the\r\nkindling gaze of a hopeless race, in place of the blank wall that had\r\nclosed its path, a vista of progress whose end, for very excess of\r\nlight, still dazzles us. Ah, my friends! who will say that to have\r\nlived then, when the weakest influence was a lever to whose touch the\r\ncenturies trembled, was not worth a share even in this era of\r\nfruition?\r\n\r\n"You know the story of that last, greatest, and most bloodless of\r\nrevolutions. In the time of one generation men laid aside the social\r\ntraditions and practices of barbarians, and assumed a social order\r\nworthy of rational and human beings. Ceasing to be predatory in their\r\nhabits, they became co-workers, and found in fraternity, at once, the\r\nscience of wealth and happiness. \'What shall I eat and drink, and\r\nwherewithal shall I be clothed?\' stated as a problem beginning and\r\nending in self, had been an anxious and an endless one. But when once\r\nit was conceived, not from the individual, but the fraternal\r\nstandpoint, \'What shall we eat and drink, and wherewithal shall we be\r\nclothed?\'--its difficulties vanished.\r\n\r\n"Poverty with servitude had been the result, for the mass of humanity,\r\nof attempting to solve the problem of maintenance from the individual\r\nstandpoint, but no sooner had the nation become the sole capitalist\r\nand employer than not alone did plenty replace poverty, but the last\r\nvestige of the serfdom of man to man disappeared from earth. Human\r\nslavery, so often vainly scotched, at last was killed. The means of\r\nsubsistence no longer doled out by men to women, by employer to\r\nemployed, by rich to poor, was distributed from a common stock as\r\namong children at the father\'s table. It was impossible for a man any\r\nlonger to use his fellow-men as tools for his own profit. His esteem\r\nwas the only sort of gain he could thenceforth make out of him. There\r\nwas no more either arrogance or servility in the relations of human\r\nbeings to one another. For the first time since the creation every man\r\nstood up straight before God. The fear of want and the lust of gain\r\nbecame extinct motives when abundance was assured to all and\r\nimmoderate possessions made impossible of attainment. There were no\r\nmore beggars nor almoners. Equity left charity without an occupation.\r\nThe ten commandments became wellnigh obsolete in a world where there\r\nwas no temptation to theft, no occasion to lie either for fear or\r\nfavor, no room for envy where all were equal, and little provocation\r\nto violence where men were disarmed of power to injure one another.\r\nHumanity\'s ancient dream of liberty, equality, fraternity, mocked by\r\nso many ages, at last was realized.\r\n\r\n"As in the old society the generous, the just, the tender-hearted had\r\nbeen placed at a disadvantage by the possession of those qualities, so\r\nin the new society the cold-hearted, the greedy, and self-seeking\r\nfound themselves out of joint with the world. Now that the conditions\r\nof life for the first time ceased to operate as a forcing process to\r\ndevelop the brutal qualities of human nature, and the premium which\r\nhad heretofore encouraged selfishness was not only removed, but placed\r\nupon unselfishness, it was for the first time possible to see what\r\nunperverted human nature really was like. The depraved tendencies,\r\nwhich had previously overgrown and obscured the better to so large an\r\nextent, now withered like cellar fungi in the open air, and the nobler\r\nqualities showed a sudden luxuriance which turned cynics into\r\npanegyrists and for the first time in human history tempted mankind to\r\nfall in love with itself. Soon was fully revealed, what the divines\r\nand philosophers of the old world never would have believed, that\r\nhuman nature in its essential qualities is good, not bad, that men by\r\ntheir natural intention and structure are generous, not selfish,\r\npitiful, not cruel, sympathetic, not arrogant, godlike in aspirations,\r\ninstinct with divinest impulses of tenderness and self-sacrifice,\r\nimages of God indeed, not the travesties upon Him they had seemed. The\r\nconstant pressure, through numberless generations, of conditions of\r\nlife which might have perverted angels, had not been able to\r\nessentially alter the natural nobility of the stock, and these\r\nconditions once removed, like a bent tree, it had sprung back to its\r\nnormal uprightness.\r\n\r\n"To put the whole matter in the nutshell of a parable, let me compare\r\nhumanity in the olden time to a rosebush planted in a swamp, watered\r\nwith black bog-water, breathing miasmatic fogs by day, and chilled\r\nwith poison dews at night. Innumerable generations of gardeners had\r\ndone their best to make it bloom, but beyond an occasional half-opened\r\nbud with a worm at the heart, their efforts had been unsuccessful.\r\nMany, indeed, claimed that the bush was no rosebush at all, but a\r\nnoxious shrub, fit only to be uprooted and burned. The gardeners, for\r\nthe most part, however, held that the bush belonged to the rose\r\nfamily, but had some ineradicable taint about it, which prevented the\r\nbuds from coming out, and accounted for its generally sickly\r\ncondition. There were a few, indeed, who maintained that the stock was\r\ngood enough, that the trouble was in the bog, and that under more\r\nfavorable conditions the plant might be expected to do better. But\r\nthese persons were not regular gardeners, and being condemned by the\r\nlatter as mere theorists and day dreamers, were for the most part, so\r\nregarded by the people. Moreover, urged some eminent moral\r\nphilosophers, even conceding for the sake of the argument that the\r\nbush might possibly do better elsewhere, it was a more valuable\r\ndiscipline for the buds to try to bloom in a bog than it would be\r\nunder more favorable conditions. The buds that succeeded in opening\r\nmight indeed be very rare, and the flowers pale and scentless, but\r\nthey represented far more moral effort than if they had bloomed\r\nspontaneously in a garden.\r\n\r\n"The regular gardeners and the moral philosophers had their way. The\r\nbush remained rooted in the bog, and the old course of treatment went\r\non. Continually new varieties of forcing mixtures were applied to the\r\nroots, and more recipes than could be numbered, each declared by its\r\nadvocates the best and only suitable preparation, were used to kill\r\nthe vermin and remove the mildew. This went on a very long time.\r\nOccasionally some one claimed to observe a slight improvement in the\r\nappearance of the bush, but there were quite as many who declared that\r\nit did not look so well as it used to. On the whole there could not be\r\nsaid to be any marked change. Finally, during a period of general\r\ndespondency as to the prospects of the bush where it was, the idea of\r\ntransplanting it was again mooted, and this time found favor. \'Let us\r\ntry it,\' was the general voice. \'Perhaps it may thrive better\r\nelsewhere, and here it is certainly doubtful if it be worth\r\ncultivating longer.\' So it came about that the rosebush of humanity\r\nwas transplanted, and set in sweet, warm, dry earth, where the sun\r\nbathed it, the stars wooed it, and the south wind caressed it. Then it\r\nappeared that it was indeed a rosebush. The vermin and the mildew\r\ndisappeared, and the bush was covered with most beautiful red roses,\r\nwhose fragrance filled the world.\r\n\r\n"It is a pledge of the destiny appointed for us that the Creator has\r\nset in our hearts an infinite standard of achievement, judged by which\r\nour past attainments seem always insignificant, and the goal never\r\nnearer. Had our forefathers conceived a state of society in which men\r\nshould live together like brethren dwelling in unity, without strifes\r\nor envying, violence or overreaching, and where, at the price of a\r\ndegree of labor not greater than health demands, in their chosen\r\noccupations, they should be wholly freed from care for the morrow and\r\nleft with no more concern for their livelihood than trees which are\r\nwatered by unfailing streams,--had they conceived such a condition, I\r\nsay, it would have seemed to them nothing less than paradise. They\r\nwould have confounded it with their idea of heaven, nor dreamed that\r\nthere could possibly lie further beyond anything to be desired or\r\nstriven for.\r\n\r\n"But how is it with us who stand on this height which they gazed up\r\nto? Already we have wellnigh forgotten, except when it is especially\r\ncalled to our minds by some occasion like the present, that it was\r\nnot always with men as it is now. It is a strain on our imaginations\r\nto conceive the social arrangements of our immediate ancestors. We\r\nfind them grotesque. The solution of the problem of physical\r\nmaintenance so as to banish care and crime, so far from seeming to us\r\nan ultimate attainment, appears but as a preliminary to anything like\r\nreal human progress. We have but relieved ourselves of an impertinent\r\nand needless harassment which hindered our ancestors from undertaking\r\nthe real ends of existence. We are merely stripped for the race; no\r\nmore. We are like a child which has just learned to stand upright and\r\nto walk. It is a great event, from the child\'s point of view, when he\r\nfirst walks. Perhaps he fancies that there can be little beyond that\r\nachievement, but a year later he has forgotten that he could not\r\nalways walk. His horizon did but widen when he rose, and enlarge as he\r\nmoved. A great event indeed, in one sense, was his first step, but\r\nonly as a beginning, not as the end. His true career was but then\r\nfirst entered on. The enfranchisement of humanity in the last century,\r\nfrom mental and physical absorption in working and scheming for the\r\nmere bodily necessities, may be regarded as a species of second birth\r\nof the race, without which its first birth to an existence that was\r\nbut a burden would forever have remained unjustified, but whereby it\r\nis now abundantly vindicated. Since then, humanity has entered on a\r\nnew phase of spiritual development, an evolution of higher faculties,\r\nthe very existence of which in human nature our ancestors scarcely\r\nsuspected. In place of the dreary hopelessness of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, its profound pessimism as to the future of humanity, the\r\nanimating idea of the present age is an enthusiastic conception of the\r\nopportunities of our earthly existence, and the unbounded\r\npossibilities of human nature. The betterment of mankind from\r\ngeneration to generation, physically, mentally, morally, is recognized\r\nas the one great object supremely worthy of effort and of sacrifice.\r\nWe believe the race for the first time to have entered on the\r\nrealization of God\'s ideal of it, and each generation must now be a\r\nstep upward.\r\n\r\n"Do you ask what we look for when unnumbered generations shall have\r\npassed away? I answer, the way stretches far before us, but the end is\r\nlost in light. For twofold is the return of man to God \'who is our\r\nhome,\' the return of the individual by the way of death, and the\r\nreturn of the race by the fulfilment of the evolution, when the divine\r\nsecret hidden in the germ shall be perfectly unfolded. With a tear for\r\nthe dark past, turn we then to the dazzling future, and, veiling our\r\neyes, press forward. The long and weary winter of the race is ended.\r\nIts summer has begun. Humanity has burst the chrysalis. The heavens\r\nare before it."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nI never could tell just why, but Sunday afternoon during my old life\r\nhad been a time when I was peculiarly subject to melancholy, when the\r\ncolor unaccountably faded out of all the aspects of life, and\r\neverything appeared pathetically uninteresting. The hours, which in\r\ngeneral were wont to bear me easily on their wings, lost the power of\r\nflight, and toward the close of the day, drooping quite to earth, had\r\nfairly to be dragged along by main strength. Perhaps it was partly\r\nowing to the established association of ideas that, despite the utter\r\nchange in my circumstances, I fell into a state of profound depression\r\non the afternoon of this my first Sunday in the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, on the present occasion a depression without\r\nspecific cause, the mere vague melancholy I have spoken of, but a\r\nsentiment suggested and certainly quite justified by my position. The\r\nsermon of Mr. Barton, with its constant implication of the vast moral\r\ngap between the century to which I belonged and that in which I found\r\nmyself, had had an effect strongly to accentuate my sense of\r\nloneliness in it. Considerately and philosophically as he had spoken,\r\nhis words could scarcely have failed to leave upon my mind a strong\r\nimpression of the mingled pity, curiosity, and aversion which I, as a\r\nrepresentative of an abhorred epoch, must excite in all around me.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary kindness with which I had been treated by Dr. Leete\r\nand his family, and especially the goodness of Edith, had hitherto\r\nprevented my fully realizing that their real sentiment toward me must\r\nnecessarily be that of the whole generation to which they belonged.\r\nThe recognition of this, as regarded Dr. Leete and his amiable wife,\r\nhowever painful, I might have endured, but the conviction that Edith\r\nmust share their feeling was more than I could bear.\r\n\r\nThe crushing effect with which this belated perception of a fact so\r\nobvious came to me opened my eyes fully to something which perhaps the\r\nreader has already suspected,--I loved Edith.\r\n\r\nWas it strange that I did? The affecting occasion on which our\r\nintimacy had begun, when her hands had drawn me out of the whirlpool\r\nof madness; the fact that her sympathy was the vital breath which had\r\nset me up in this new life and enabled me to support it; my habit of\r\nlooking to her as the mediator between me and the world around in a\r\nsense that even her father was not,--these were circumstances that had\r\npredetermined a result which her remarkable loveliness of person and\r\ndisposition would alone have accounted for. It was quite inevitable\r\nthat she should have come to seem to me, in a sense quite different\r\nfrom the usual experience of lovers, the only woman in this world. Now\r\nthat I had become suddenly sensible of the fatuity of the hopes I had\r\nbegun to cherish, I suffered not merely what another lover might, but\r\nin addition a desolate loneliness, an utter forlornness, such as no\r\nother lover, however unhappy, could have felt.\r\n\r\nMy hosts evidently saw that I was depressed in spirits, and did their\r\nbest to divert me. Edith especially, I could see, was distressed for\r\nme, but according to the usual perversity of lovers, having once been\r\nso mad as to dream of receiving something more from her, there was no\r\nlonger any virtue for me in a kindness that I knew was only sympathy.\r\n\r\nToward nightfall, after secluding myself in my room most of the\r\nafternoon, I went into the garden to walk about. The day was overcast,\r\nwith an autumnal flavor in the warm, still air. Finding myself near\r\nthe excavation, I entered the subterranean chamber and sat down there.\r\n"This," I muttered to myself, "is the only home I have. Let me stay\r\nhere, and not go forth any more." Seeking aid from the familiar\r\nsurroundings, I endeavored to find a sad sort of consolation in\r\nreviving the past and summoning up the forms and faces that were about\r\nme in my former life. It was in vain. There was no longer any life in\r\nthem. For nearly one hundred years the stars had been looking down on\r\nEdith Bartlett\'s grave, and the graves of all my generation.\r\n\r\nThe past was dead, crushed beneath a century\'s weight, and from the\r\npresent I was shut out. There was no place for me anywhere. I was\r\nneither dead nor properly alive.\r\n\r\n"Forgive me for following you."\r\n\r\nI looked up. Edith stood in the door of the subterranean room,\r\nregarding me smilingly, but with eyes full of sympathetic distress.\r\n\r\n"Send me away if I am intruding on you," she said; "but we saw that\r\nyou were out of spirits, and you know you promised to let me know if\r\nthat were so. You have not kept your word."\r\n\r\nI rose and came to the door, trying to smile, but making, I fancy,\r\nrather sorry work of it, for the sight of her loveliness brought home\r\nto me the more poignantly the cause of my wretchedness.\r\n\r\n"I was feeling a little lonely, that is all," I said. "Has it never\r\noccurred to you that my position is so much more utterly alone than\r\nany human being\'s ever was before that a new word is really needed to\r\ndescribe it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you must not talk that way,--you must not let yourself feel that\r\nway,--you must not!" she exclaimed, with moistened eyes. "Are we not\r\nyour friends? It is your own fault if you will not let us be. You need\r\nnot be lonely."\r\n\r\n"You are good to me beyond my power of understanding," I said, "but\r\ndon\'t you suppose that I know it is pity merely, sweet pity, but pity\r\nonly. I should be a fool not to know that I cannot seem to you as\r\nother men of your own generation do, but as some strange uncanny\r\nbeing, a stranded creature of an unknown sea, whose forlornness\r\ntouches your compassion despite its grotesqueness. I have been so\r\nfoolish, you were so kind, as to almost forget that this must needs be\r\nso, and to fancy I might in time become naturalized, as we used to\r\nsay, in this age, so as to feel like one of you and to seem to you\r\nlike the other men about you. But Mr. Barton\'s sermon taught me how\r\nvain such a fancy is, how great the gulf between us must seem to you."\r\n\r\n"Oh that miserable sermon!" she exclaimed, fairly crying now in her\r\nsympathy, "I wanted you not to hear it. What does he know of you? He\r\nhas read in old musty books about your times, that is all. What do you\r\ncare about him, to let yourself be vexed by anything he said? Isn\'t it\r\nanything to you, that we who know you feel differently? Don\'t you care\r\nmore about what we think of you than what he does who never saw you?\r\nOh, Mr. West! you don\'t know, you can\'t think, how it makes me feel to\r\nsee you so forlorn. I can\'t have it so. What can I say to you? How can\r\nI convince you how different our feeling for you is from what you\r\nthink?"\r\n\r\nAs before, in that other crisis of my fate when she had come to me,\r\nshe extended her hands towards me in a gesture of helpfulness, and, as\r\nthen, I caught and held them in my own; her bosom heaved with strong\r\nemotion, and little tremors in the fingers which I clasped emphasized\r\nthe depth of her feeling. In her face, pity contended in a sort of\r\ndivine spite against the obstacles which reduced it to impotence.\r\nWomanly compassion surely never wore a guise more lovely.\r\n\r\nSuch beauty and such goodness quite melted me, and it seemed that the\r\nonly fitting response I could make was to tell her just the truth. Of\r\ncourse I had not a spark of hope, but on the other hand I had no fear\r\nthat she would be angry. She was too pitiful for that. So I said\r\npresently, "It is very ungrateful in me not to be satisfied with such\r\nkindness as you have shown me, and are showing me now. But are you so\r\nblind as not to see why they are not enough to make me happy? Don\'t\r\nyou see that it is because I have been mad enough to love you?"\r\n\r\nAt my last words she blushed deeply and her eyes fell before mine, but\r\nshe made no effort to withdraw her hands from my clasp. For some\r\nmoments she stood so, panting a little. Then blushing deeper than\r\never, but with a dazzling smile, she looked up.\r\n\r\n"Are you sure it is not you who are blind?" she said.\r\n\r\nThat was all, but it was enough, for it told me that, unaccountable,\r\nincredible as it was, this radiant daughter of a golden age had\r\nbestowed upon me not alone her pity, but her love. Still, I half\r\nbelieved I must be under some blissful hallucination even as I clasped\r\nher in my arms. "If I am beside myself," I cried, "let me remain so."\r\n\r\n"It is I whom you must think beside myself," she panted, escaping from\r\nmy arms when I had barely tasted the sweetness of her lips. "Oh! oh!\r\nwhat must you think of me almost to throw myself in the arms of one I\r\nhave known but a week? I did not mean that you should find it out so\r\nsoon, but I was so sorry for you I forgot what I was saying. No, no;\r\nyou must not touch me again till you know who I am. After that, sir,\r\nyou shall apologize to me very humbly for thinking, as I know you do,\r\nthat I have been over quick to fall in love with you. After you know\r\nwho I am, you will be bound to confess that it was nothing less than\r\nmy duty to fall in love with you at first sight, and that no girl of\r\nproper feeling in my place could do otherwise."\r\n\r\nAs may be supposed, I would have been quite content to waive\r\nexplanations, but Edith was resolute that there should be no more\r\nkisses until she had been vindicated from all suspicion of\r\nprecipitancy in the bestowal of her affections, and I was fain to\r\nfollow the lovely enigma into the house. Having come where her mother\r\nwas, she blushingly whispered something in her ear and ran away,\r\nleaving us together. It then appeared that, strange as my experience\r\nhad been, I was now first to know what was perhaps its strangest\r\nfeature. From Mrs. Leete I learned that Edith was the great-granddaughter\r\nof no other than my lost love, Edith Bartlett. After mourning me for\r\nfourteen years, she had made a marriage of esteem, and left a son who\r\nhad been Mrs. Leete\'s father. Mrs. Leete had never seen her\r\ngrandmother, but had heard much of her, and, when her daughter was\r\nborn, gave her the name of Edith. This fact might have tended to\r\nincrease the interest which the girl took, as she grew up, in all that\r\nconcerned her ancestress, and especially the tragic story of the\r\nsupposed death of the lover, whose wife she expected to be, in the\r\nconflagration of his house. It was a tale well calculated to touch the\r\nsympathy of a romantic girl, and the fact that the blood of the\r\nunfortunate heroine was in her own veins naturally heightened Edith\'s\r\ninterest in it. A portrait of Edith Bartlett and some of her papers,\r\nincluding a packet of my own letters, were among the family heirlooms.\r\nThe picture represented a very beautiful young woman about whom it was\r\neasy to imagine all manner of tender and romantic things. My letters\r\ngave Edith some material for forming a distinct idea of my\r\npersonality, and both together sufficed to make the sad old story very\r\nreal to her. She used to tell her parents, half jestingly, that she\r\nwould never marry till she found a lover like Julian West, and there\r\nwere none such nowadays.\r\n\r\nNow all this, of course, was merely the daydreaming of a girl whose\r\nmind had never been taken up by a love affair of her own, and would\r\nhave had no serious consequence but for the discovery that morning of\r\nthe buried vault in her father\'s garden and the revelation of the\r\nidentity of its inmate. For when the apparently lifeless form had been\r\nborne into the house, the face in the locket found upon the breast was\r\ninstantly recognized as that of Edith Bartlett, and by that fact,\r\ntaken in connection with the other circumstances, they knew that I was\r\nno other than Julian West. Even had there been no thought, as at first\r\nthere was not, of my resuscitation, Mrs. Leete said she believed that\r\nthis event would have affected her daughter in a critical and\r\nlife-long manner. The presumption of some subtle ordering of destiny,\r\ninvolving her fate with mine, would under all circumstances have\r\npossessed an irresistible fascination for almost any woman.\r\n\r\nWhether when I came back to life a few hours afterward, and from the\r\nfirst seemed to turn to her with a peculiar dependence and to find a\r\nspecial solace in her company, she had been too quick in giving her\r\nlove at the first sign of mine, I could now, her mother said, judge\r\nfor myself. If I thought so, I must remember that this, after all, was\r\nthe twentieth and not the nineteenth century, and love was, no doubt,\r\nnow quicker in growth, as well as franker in utterance than then.\r\n\r\nFrom Mrs. Leete I went to Edith. When I found her, it was first of all\r\nto take her by both hands and stand a long time in rapt contemplation\r\nof her face. As I gazed, the memory of that other Edith, which had\r\nbeen affected as with a benumbing shock by the tremendous experience\r\nthat had parted us, revived, and my heart was dissolved with tender\r\nand pitiful emotions, but also very blissful ones. For she who brought\r\nto me so poignantly the sense of my loss was to make that loss good.\r\nIt was as if from her eyes Edith Bartlett looked into mine, and smiled\r\nconsolation to me. My fate was not alone the strangest, but the most\r\nfortunate that ever befell a man. A double miracle had been wrought\r\nfor me. I had not been stranded upon the shore of this strange world\r\nto find myself alone and companionless. My love, whom I had dreamed\r\nlost, had been reembodied for my consolation. When at last, in an\r\necstasy of gratitude and tenderness, I folded the lovely girl in my\r\narms, the two Ediths were blended in my thought, nor have they ever\r\nsince been clearly distinguished. I was not long in finding that on\r\nEdith\'s part there was a corresponding confusion of identities. Never,\r\nsurely, was there between freshly united lovers a stranger talk than\r\nours that afternoon. She seemed more anxious to have me speak of Edith\r\nBartlett than of herself, of how I had loved her than how I loved\r\nherself, rewarding my fond words concerning another woman with tears\r\nand tender smiles and pressures of the hand.\r\n\r\n"You must not love me too much for myself," she said. "I shall be very\r\njealous for her. I shall not let you forget her. I am going to tell\r\nyou something which you may think strange. Do you not believe that\r\nspirits sometimes come back to the world to fulfill some work that lay\r\nnear their hearts? What if I were to tell you that I have sometimes\r\nthought that her spirit lives in me,--that Edith Bartlett, not Edith\r\nLeete, is my real name. I cannot know it; of course none of us can\r\nknow who we really are; but I can feel it. Can you wonder that I have\r\nsuch a feeling, seeing how my life was affected by her and by you,\r\neven before you came. So you see you need not trouble to love me at\r\nall, if only you are true to her. I shall not be likely to be\r\njealous."\r\n\r\nDr. Leete had gone out that afternoon, and I did not have an interview\r\nwith him till later. He was not, apparently, wholly unprepared for the\r\nintelligence I conveyed, and shook my hand heartily.\r\n\r\n"Under any ordinary circumstances, Mr. West, I should say that this\r\nstep had been taken on rather short acquaintance; but these are\r\ndecidedly not ordinary circumstances. In fairness, perhaps I ought to\r\ntell you," he added, smilingly, "that while I cheerfully consent to\r\nthe proposed arrangement, you must not feel too much indebted to me,\r\nas I judge my consent is a mere formality. From the moment the secret\r\nof the locket was out, it had to be, I fancy. Why, bless me, if Edith\r\nhad not been there to redeem her great-grandmother\'s pledge, I really\r\napprehend that Mrs. Leete\'s loyalty to me would have suffered a severe\r\nstrain."\r\n\r\nThat evening the garden was bathed in moonlight, and till midnight\r\nEdith and I wandered to and fro there, trying to grow accustomed to\r\nour happiness.\r\n\r\n"What should I have done if you had not cared for me?" she exclaimed.\r\n"I was afraid you were not going to. What should I have done then,\r\nwhen I felt I was consecrated to you! As soon as you came back to\r\nlife, I was as sure as if she had told me that I was to be to you what\r\nshe could not be, but that could only be if you would let me. Oh, how\r\nI wanted to tell you that morning, when you felt so terribly strange\r\namong us, who I was, but dared not open my lips about that, or let\r\nfather or mother"--\r\n\r\n"That must have been what you would not let your father tell me!" I\r\nexclaimed, referring to the conversation I had overheard as I came out\r\nof my trance.\r\n\r\n"Of course it was," Edith laughed. "Did you only just guess that?\r\nFather being only a man, thought that it would make you feel among\r\nfriends to tell you who we were. He did not think of me at all. But\r\nmother knew what I meant, and so I had my way. I could never have\r\nlooked you in the face if you had known who I was. It would have been\r\nforcing myself on you quite too boldly. I am afraid you think I did\r\nthat to-day, as it was. I am sure I did not mean to, for I know girls\r\nwere expected to hide their feelings in your day, and I was dreadfully\r\nafraid of shocking you. Ah me, how hard it must have been for them to\r\nhave always had to conceal their love like a fault. Why did they think\r\nit such a shame to love any one till they had been given permission?\r\nIt is so odd to think of waiting for permission to fall in love. Was\r\nit because men in those days were angry when girls loved them? That is\r\nnot the way women would feel, I am sure, or men either, I think, now.\r\nI don\'t understand it at all. That will be one of the curious things\r\nabout the women of those days that you will have to explain to me. I\r\ndon\'t believe Edith Bartlett was so foolish as the others."\r\n\r\nAfter sundry ineffectual attempts at parting, she finally insisted\r\nthat we must say good night. I was about to imprint upon her lips the\r\npositively last kiss, when she said, with an indescribable archness:--\r\n\r\n"One thing troubles me. Are you sure that you quite forgive Edith\r\nBartlett for marrying any one else? The books that have come down to\r\nus make out lovers of your time more jealous than fond, and that is\r\nwhat makes me ask. It would be a great relief to me if I could feel\r\nsure that you were not in the least jealous of my great-grandfather\r\nfor marrying your sweetheart. May I tell my great-grandmother\'s\r\npicture when I go to my room that you quite forgive her for proving\r\nfalse to you?"\r\n\r\nWill the reader believe it, this coquettish quip, whether the speaker\r\nherself had any idea of it or not, actually touched and with the\r\ntouching cured a preposterous ache of something like jealousy which I\r\nhad been vaguely conscious of ever since Mrs. Leete had told me of\r\nEdith Bartlett\'s marriage. Even while I had been holding Edith\r\nBartlett\'s great-granddaughter in my arms, I had not, till this\r\nmoment, so illogical are some of our feelings, distinctly realized\r\nthat but for that marriage I could not have done so. The absurdity of\r\nthis frame of mind could only be equalled by the abruptness with which\r\nit dissolved as Edith\'s roguish query cleared the fog from my\r\nperceptions. I laughed as I kissed her.\r\n\r\n"You may assure her of my entire forgiveness," I said, "although if it\r\nhad been any man but your great-grandfather whom she married, it would\r\nhave been a very different matter."\r\n\r\nOn reaching my chamber that night I did not open the musical telephone\r\nthat I might be lulled to sleep with soothing tunes, as had become my\r\nhabit. For once my thoughts made better music than even twentieth\r\ncentury orchestras discourse, and it held me enchanted till well\r\ntoward morning, when I fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n"It\'s a little after the time you told me to wake you, sir. You did\r\nnot come out of it as quick as common, sir."\r\n\r\nThe voice was the voice of my man Sawyer. I started bolt upright in\r\nbed and stared around. I was in my underground chamber. The mellow\r\nlight of the lamp which always burned in the room when I occupied it\r\nillumined the familiar walls and furnishings. By my bedside, with the\r\nglass of sherry in his hand which Dr. Pillsbury prescribed on first\r\nrousing from a mesmeric sleep, by way of awakening the torpid physical\r\nfunctions, stood Sawyer.\r\n\r\n"Better take this right off, sir," he said, as I stared blankly at\r\nhim. "You look kind of flushed like, sir, and you need it."\r\n\r\nI tossed off the liquor and began to realize what had happened to me.\r\nIt was, of course, very plain. All that about the twentieth century\r\nhad been a dream. I had but dreamed of that enlightened and care-free\r\nrace of men and their ingeniously simple institutions, of the glorious\r\nnew Boston with its domes and pinnacles, its gardens and fountains,\r\nand its universal reign of comfort. The amiable family which I had\r\nlearned to know so well, my genial host and Mentor, Dr. Leete, his\r\nwife, and their daughter, the second and more beauteous Edith, my\r\nbetrothed,--these, too, had been but figments of a vision.\r\n\r\nFor a considerable time I remained in the attitude in which this\r\nconviction had come over me, sitting up in bed gazing at vacancy,\r\nabsorbed in recalling the scenes and incidents of my fantastic\r\nexperience. Sawyer, alarmed at my looks, was meanwhile anxiously\r\ninquiring what was the matter with me. Roused at length by his\r\nimportunities to a recognition of my surroundings, I pulled myself\r\ntogether with an effort and assured the faithful fellow that I was all\r\nright. "I have had an extraordinary dream, that\'s all, Sawyer," I\r\nsaid, "a most-ex-traor-dinary-dream."\r\n\r\nI dressed in a mechanical way, feeling lightheaded and oddly uncertain\r\nof myself, and sat down to the coffee and rolls which Sawyer was in\r\nthe habit of providing for my refreshment before I left the house. The\r\nmorning newspaper lay by the plate. I took it up, and my eye fell on\r\nthe date, May 31, 1887. I had known, of course, from the moment I\r\nopened my eyes that my long and detailed experience in another century\r\nhad been a dream, and yet it was startling to have it so conclusively\r\ndemonstrated that the world was but a few hours older than when I had\r\nlain down to sleep.\r\n\r\nGlancing at the table of contents at the head of the paper, which\r\nreviewed the news of the morning, I read the following summary:--\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\n"FOREIGN AFFAIRS.--The impending war between France and Germany.\r\nThe French Chambers asked for new military credits to meet Germany\'s\r\nincrease of her army.

Professor Brown\'s oration on the moral grandeur of\r\nnineteenth century civilization."\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nIt was indeed the nineteenth century to which I had awaked; there\r\ncould be no kind of doubt about that. Its complete microcosm this\r\nsummary of the day\'s news had presented, even to that last\r\nunmistakable touch of fatuous self-complacency. Coming after such a\r\ndamning indictment of the age as that one day\'s chronicle of\r\nworld-wide bloodshed, greed, and tyranny, was a bit of cynicism worthy\r\nof Mephistopheles, and yet of all whose eyes it had met this morning I\r\nwas, perhaps, the only one who perceived the cynicism, and but\r\nyesterday I should have perceived it no more than the others. That\r\nstrange dream it was which had made all the difference. For I know not\r\nhow long, I forgot my surroundings after this, and was again in fancy\r\nmoving in that vivid dream-world, in that glorious city, with its\r\nhomes of simple comfort and its gorgeous public palaces. Around me\r\nwere again faces unmarred by arrogance or servility, by envy or greed,\r\nby anxious care or feverish ambition, and stately forms of men and\r\nwomen who had never known fear of a fellow man or depended on his\r\nfavor, but always, in the words of that sermon which still rang in my\r\nears, had "stood up straight before God."\r\n\r\nWith a profound sigh and a sense of irreparable loss, not the less\r\npoignant that it was a loss of what had never really been, I roused at\r\nlast from my reverie, and soon after left the house.\r\n\r\nA dozen times between my door and Washington Street I had to stop and\r\npull myself together, such power had been in that vision of the Boston\r\nof the future to make the real Boston strange. The squalor and\r\nmalodorousness of the town struck me, from the moment I stood upon the\r\nstreet, as facts I had never before observed. But yesterday, moreover,\r\nit had seemed quite a matter of course that some of my fellow-citizens\r\nshould wear silks, and others rags, that some should look well fed,\r\nand others hungry. Now on the contrary the glaring disparities in the\r\ndress and condition of the men and women who brushed each other on the\r\nsidewalks shocked me at every step, and yet more the entire\r\nindifference which the prosperous showed to the plight of the\r\nunfortunate. Were these human beings, who could behold the\r\nwretchedness of their fellows without so much as a change of\r\ncountenance? And yet, all the while, I knew well that it was I who had\r\nchanged, and not my contemporaries. I had dreamed of a city whose\r\npeople fared all alike as children of one family and were one\r\nanother\'s keepers in all things.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of the real Boston, which assumed the extraordinary\r\neffect of strangeness that marks familiar things seen in a new light,\r\nwas the prevalence of advertising. There had been no personal\r\nadvertising in the Boston of the twentieth century, because there was\r\nno need of any, but here the walls of the buildings, the windows, the\r\nbroadsides of the newspapers in every hand, the very pavements,\r\neverything in fact in sight, save the sky, were covered with the\r\nappeals of individuals who sought, under innumerable pretexts, to\r\nattract the contributions of others to their support. However the\r\nwording might vary, the tenor of all these appeals was the same:--\r\n\r\n"Help John Jones. Never mind the rest. They are frauds. I, John Jones,\r\nam the right one. Buy of me. Employ me. Visit me. Hear me, John Jones.\r\nLook at me. Make no mistake, John Jones is the man and nobody else.\r\nLet the rest starve, but for God\'s sake remember John Jones!"\r\n\r\nWhether the pathos or the moral repulsiveness of the spectacle most\r\nimpressed me, so suddenly become a stranger in my own city, I know\r\nnot. Wretched men, I was moved to cry, who, because they will not\r\nlearn to be helpers of one another, are doomed to be beggars of one\r\nanother from the least to the greatest! This horrible babel of\r\nshameless self-assertion and mutual depreciation, this stunning clamor\r\nof conflicting boasts, appeals, and adjurations, this stupendous\r\nsystem of brazen beggary, what was it all but the necessity of a\r\nsociety in which the opportunity to serve the world according to his\r\ngifts, instead of being secured to every man as the first object of\r\nsocial organization, had to be fought for!\r\n\r\nI reached Washington Street at the busiest point, and there I stood\r\nand laughed aloud, to the scandal of the passers-by. For my life I\r\ncould not have helped it, with such a mad humor was I moved at sight\r\nof the interminable rows of stores on either side, up and down the\r\nstreet so far as I could see,--scores of them, to make the spectacle\r\nmore utterly preposterous, within a stone\'s throw devoted to selling\r\nthe same sort of goods. Stores! stores! stores! miles of stores! ten\r\nthousand stores to distribute the goods needed by this one city, which\r\nin my dream had been supplied with all things from a single warehouse,\r\nas they were ordered through one great store in every quarter, where\r\nthe buyer, without waste of time or labor, found under one roof the\r\nworld\'s assortment in whatever line he desired. There the labor of\r\ndistribution had been so slight as to add but a scarcely perceptible\r\nfraction to the cost of commodities to the user. The cost of\r\nproduction was virtually all he paid. But here the mere distribution\r\nof the goods, their handling alone, added a fourth, a third, a half\r\nand more, to the cost. All these ten thousand plants must be paid for,\r\ntheir rent, their staffs of superintendence, their platoons of\r\nsalesmen, their ten thousand sets of accountants, jobbers, and\r\nbusiness dependents, with all they spent in advertising themselves and\r\nfighting one another, and the consumers must do the paying. What a\r\nfamous process for beggaring a nation!\r\n\r\nWere these serious men I saw about me, or children, who did their\r\nbusiness on such a plan? Could they be reasoning beings, who did not\r\nsee the folly which, when the product is made and ready for use,\r\nwastes so much of it in getting it to the user? If people eat with a\r\nspoon that leaks half its contents between bowl and lip, are they not\r\nlikely to go hungry?\r\n\r\nI had passed through Washington Street thousands of times before and\r\nviewed the ways of those who sold merchandise, but my curiosity\r\nconcerning them was as if I had never gone by their way before. I took\r\nwondering note of the show windows of the stores, filled with goods\r\narranged with a wealth of pains and artistic device to attract the\r\neye. I saw the throngs of ladies looking in, and the proprietors\r\neagerly watching the effect of the bait. I went within and noted the\r\nhawk-eyed floor-walker watching for business, overlooking the clerks,\r\nkeeping them up to their task of inducing the customers to buy, buy,\r\nbuy, for money if they had it, for credit if they had it not, to buy\r\nwhat they wanted not, more than they wanted, what they could not\r\nafford. At times I momentarily lost the clue and was confused by the\r\nsight. Why this effort to induce people to buy? Surely that had\r\nnothing to do with the legitimate business of distributing products to\r\nthose who needed them. Surely it was the sheerest waste to force upon\r\npeople what they did not want, but what might be useful to another.\r\nThe nation was so much the poorer for every such achievement. What\r\nwere these clerks thinking of? Then I would remember that they were\r\nnot acting as distributors like those in the store I had visited in\r\nthe dream Boston. They were not serving the public interest, but their\r\nimmediate personal interest, and it was nothing to them what the\r\nultimate effect of their course on the general prosperity might be, if\r\nbut they increased their own hoard, for these goods were their own,\r\nand the more they sold and the more they got for them, the greater\r\ntheir gain. The more wasteful the people were, the more articles they\r\ndid not want which they could be induced to buy, the better for these\r\nsellers. To encourage prodigality was the express aim of the ten\r\nthousand stores of Boston.\r\n\r\nNor were these storekeepers and clerks a whit worse men than any\r\nothers in Boston. They must earn a living and support their families,\r\nand how were they to find a trade to do it by which did not\r\nnecessitate placing their individual interests before those of others\r\nand that of all? They could not be asked to starve while they waited\r\nfor an order of things such as I had seen in my dream, in which the\r\ninterest of each and that of all were identical. But, God in heaven!\r\nwhat wonder, under such a system as this about me--what wonder that\r\nthe city was so shabby, and the people so meanly dressed, and so many\r\nof them ragged and hungry!\r\n\r\nSome time after this it was that I drifted over into South Boston and\r\nfound myself among the manufacturing establishments. I had been in\r\nthis quarter of the city a hundred times before, just as I had been on\r\nWashington Street, but here, as well as there, I now first perceived\r\nthe true significance of what I witnessed. Formerly I had taken pride\r\nin the fact that, by actual count, Boston had some four thousand\r\nindependent manufacturing establishments; but in this very\r\nmultiplicity and independence I recognized now the secret of the\r\ninsignificant total product of their industry.\r\n\r\nIf Washington Street had been like a lane in Bedlam, this was a\r\nspectacle as much more melancholy as production is a more vital\r\nfunction, than distribution. For not only were these four thousand\r\nestablishments not working in concert, and for that reason alone\r\noperating at prodigious disadvantage, but, as if this did not involve\r\na sufficiently disastrous loss of power, they were using their utmost\r\nskill to frustrate one another\'s effort, praying by night and working\r\nby day for the destruction of one another\'s enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe roar and rattle of wheels and hammers resounding from every side\r\nwas not the hum of a peaceful industry, but the clangor of swords\r\nwielded by foemen. These mills and shops were so many forts, each\r\nunder its own flag, its guns trained on the mills and shops about it,\r\nand its sappers busy below, undermining them.\r\n\r\nWithin each one of these forts the strictest organization of industry\r\nwas insisted on; the separate gangs worked under a single central\r\nauthority. No interference and no duplicating of work were permitted.\r\nEach had his allotted task, and none were idle. By what hiatus in the\r\nlogical faculty, by what lost link of reasoning, account, then, for\r\nthe failure to recognize the necessity of applying the same principle\r\nto the organization of the national industries as a whole, to see that\r\nif lack of organization could impair the efficiency of a shop, it must\r\nhave effects as much more disastrous in disabling the industries of\r\nthe nation at large as the latter are vaster in volume and more\r\ncomplex in the relationship of their parts.\r\n\r\nPeople would be prompt enough to ridicule an army in which there were\r\nneither companies, battalions, regiments, brigades, divisions, or army\r\ncorps,--no unit of organization, in fact, larger than the corporal\'s\r\nsquad, with no officer higher than a corporal, and all the corporals\r\nequal in authority. And yet just such an army were the manufacturing\r\nindustries of nineteenth century Boston, an army of four thousand\r\nindependent squads led by four thousand independent corporals, each\r\nwith a separate plan of campaign.\r\n\r\nKnots of idle men were to be seen here and there on every side, some\r\nidle because they could find no work at any price, others because they\r\ncould not get what they thought a fair price.\r\n\r\nI accosted some of the latter, and they told me their grievances. It\r\nwas very little comfort I could give them. "I am sorry for you," I\r\nsaid. "You get little enough, certainly, and yet the wonder to me is,\r\nnot that industries conducted as these are do not pay you living\r\nwages, but that they are able to pay you any wages at all."\r\n\r\nMaking my way back again after this to the peninsular city, toward\r\nthree o\'clock I stood on State Street, staring, as if I had never seen\r\nthem before, at the banks and brokers\' offices, and other financial\r\ninstitutions, of which there had been in the State Street of my vision\r\nno vestige. Business men, confidential clerks, and errand boys were\r\nthronging in and out of the banks, for it wanted but a few minutes of\r\nthe closing hour. Opposite me was the bank where I did business, and\r\npresently I crossed the street, and, going in with the crowd, stood in\r\na recess of the wall looking on at the army of clerks handling money,\r\nand the cues of depositors at the tellers\' windows. An old gentleman\r\nwhom I knew, a director of the bank, passing me and observing my\r\ncontemplative attitude, stopped a moment.\r\n\r\n"Interesting sight, isn\'t it, Mr. West," he said. "Wonderful piece of\r\nmechanism; I find it so myself. I like sometimes to stand and look on\r\nat it just as you are doing. It\'s a poem, sir, a poem, that\'s what I\r\ncall it. Did you ever think, Mr. West, that the bank is the heart of\r\nthe business system? From it and to it, in endless flux and reflux,\r\nthe life blood goes. It is flowing in now. It will flow out again in\r\nthe morning;" and pleased with his little conceit, the old man passed\r\non smiling.\r\n\r\nYesterday I should have considered the simile apt enough, but since\r\nthen I had visited a world incomparably more affluent than this, in\r\nwhich money was unknown and without conceivable use. I had learned\r\nthat it had a use in the world around me only because the work of\r\nproducing the nation\'s livelihood, instead of being regarded as the\r\nmost strictly public and common of all concerns, and as such conducted\r\nby the nation, was abandoned to the hap-hazard efforts of individuals.\r\nThis original mistake necessitated endless exchanges to bring about\r\nany sort of general distribution of products. These exchanges money\r\neffected--how equitably, might be seen in a walk from the tenement\r\nhouse districts to the Back Bay--at the cost of an army of men taken\r\nfrom productive labor to manage it, with constant ruinous breakdowns\r\nof its machinery, and a generally debauching influence on mankind\r\nwhich had justified its description, from ancient time, as the "root\r\nof all evil."\r\n\r\nAlas for the poor old bank director with his poem! He had mistaken the\r\nthrobbing of an abscess for the beating of the heart. What he called\r\n"a wonderful piece of mechanism" was an imperfect device to remedy an\r\nunnecessary defect, the clumsy crutch of a self-made cripple.\r\n\r\nAfter the banks had closed I wandered aimlessly about the business\r\nquarter for an hour or two, and later sat a while on one of the\r\nbenches of the Common, finding an interest merely in watching the\r\nthrongs that passed, such as one has in studying the populace of a\r\nforeign city, so strange since yesterday had my fellow citizens and\r\ntheir ways become to me. For thirty years I had lived among them, and\r\nyet I seemed to have never noted before how drawn and anxious were\r\ntheir faces, of the rich as of the poor, the refined, acute faces of\r\nthe educated as well as the dull masks of the ignorant. And well it\r\nmight be so, for I saw now, as never before I had seen so plainly,\r\nthat each as he walked constantly turned to catch the whispers of a\r\nspectre at his ear, the spectre of Uncertainty. "Do your work never so\r\nwell," the spectre was whispering,--"rise early and toil till late,\r\nrob cunningly or serve faithfully, you shall never know security. Rich\r\nyou may be now and still come to poverty at last. Leave never so much\r\nwealth to your children, you cannot buy the assurance that your son\r\nmay not be the servant of your servant, or that your daughter will not\r\nhave to sell herself for bread."\r\n\r\nA man passing by thrust an advertising card in my hand, which set\r\nforth the merits of some new scheme of life insurance. The incident\r\nreminded me of the only device, pathetic in its admission of the\r\nuniversal need it so poorly supplied, which offered these tired and\r\nhunted men and women even a partial protection from uncertainty. By\r\nthis means, those already well-to-do, I remembered, might purchase a\r\nprecarious confidence that after their death their loved ones would\r\nnot, for a while at least, be trampled under the feet of men. But this\r\nwas all, and this was only for those who could pay well for it. What\r\nidea was possible to these wretched dwellers in the land of Ishmael,\r\nwhere every man\'s hand was against each and the hand of each against\r\nevery other, of true life insurance as I had seen it among the people\r\nof that dream land, each of whom, by virtue merely of his membership\r\nin the national family, was guaranteed against need of any sort, by a\r\npolicy underwritten by one hundred million fellow countrymen.\r\n\r\nSome time after this it was that I recall a glimpse of myself standing\r\non the steps of a building on Tremont Street, looking at a military\r\nparade. A regiment was passing. It was the first sight in that dreary\r\nday which had inspired me with any other emotions than wondering pity\r\nand amazement. Here at last were order and reason, an exhibition of\r\nwhat intelligent cooperation can accomplish. The people who stood\r\nlooking on with kindling faces,--could it be that the sight had for\r\nthem no more than but a spectacular interest? Could they fail to see\r\nthat it was their perfect concert of action, their organization under\r\none control, which made these men the tremendous engine they were,\r\nable to vanquish a mob ten times as numerous? Seeing this so plainly,\r\ncould they fail to compare the scientific manner in which the nation\r\nwent to war with the unscientific manner in which it went to work?\r\nWould they not query since what time the killing of men had been a\r\ntask so much more important than feeding and clothing them, that a\r\ntrained army should be deemed alone adequate to the former, while the\r\nlatter was left to a mob?\r\n\r\nIt was now toward nightfall, and the streets were thronged with the\r\nworkers from the stores, the shops, and mills. Carried along with the\r\nstronger part of the current, I found myself, as it began to grow\r\ndark, in the midst of a scene of squalor and human degradation such as\r\nonly the South Cove tenement district could present. I had seen the\r\nmad wasting of human labor; here I saw in direst shape the want that\r\nwaste had bred.\r\n\r\nFrom the black doorways and windows of the rookeries on every side\r\ncame gusts of fetid air. The streets and alleys reeked with the\r\neffluvia of a slave ship\'s between-decks. As I passed I had glimpses\r\nwithin of pale babies gasping out their lives amid sultry stenches, of\r\nhopeless-faced women deformed by hardship, retaining of womanhood no\r\ntrait save weakness, while from the windows leered girls with brows of\r\nbrass. Like the starving bands of mongrel curs that infest the streets\r\nof Moslem towns, swarms of half-clad brutalized children filled the\r\nair with shrieks and curses as they fought and tumbled among the\r\ngarbage that littered the court-yards.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in all this that was new to me. Often had I passed\r\nthrough this part of the city and witnessed its sights with feelings\r\nof disgust mingled with a certain philosophical wonder at the\r\nextremities mortals will endure and still cling to life. But not alone\r\nas regarded the economical follies of this age, but equally as touched\r\nits moral abominations, scales had fallen from my eyes since that\r\nvision of another century. No more did I look upon the woful dwellers\r\nin this Inferno with a callous curiosity as creatures scarcely human.\r\nI saw in them my brothers and sisters, my parents, my children, flesh\r\nof my flesh, blood of my blood. The festering mass of human\r\nwretchedness about me offended not now my senses merely, but pierced\r\nmy heart like a knife, so that I could not repress sighs and groans. I\r\nnot only saw but felt in my body all that I saw.\r\n\r\nPresently, too, as I observed the wretched beings about me more\r\nclosely, I perceived that they were all quite dead. Their bodies were\r\nso many living sepulchres. On each brutal brow was plainly written the\r\n_hic jacet_ of a soul dead within.\r\n\r\nAs I looked, horror struck, from one death\'s head to another, I was\r\naffected by a singular hallucination. Like a wavering translucent\r\nspirit face superimposed upon each of these brutish masks I saw the\r\nideal, the possible face that would have been the actual if mind and\r\nsoul had lived. It was not till I was aware of these ghostly faces,\r\nand of the reproach that could not be gainsaid which was in their\r\neyes, that the full piteousness of the ruin that had been wrought was\r\nrevealed to me. I was moved with contrition as with a strong agony,\r\nfor I had been one of those who had endured that these things should\r\nbe. I had been one of those who, well knowing that they were, had not\r\ndesired to hear or be compelled to think much of them, but had gone on\r\nas if they were not, seeking my own pleasure and profit. Therefore now\r\nI found upon my garments the blood of this great multitude of\r\nstrangled souls of my brothers. The voice of their blood cried out\r\nagainst me from the ground. Every stone of the reeking pavements,\r\nevery brick of the pestilential rookeries, found a tongue and called\r\nafter me as I fled: What hast thou done with thy brother Abel?\r\n\r\nI have no clear recollection of anything after this till I found\r\nmyself standing on the carved stone steps of the magnificent home of\r\nmy betrothed in Commonwealth avenue. Amid the tumult of my thoughts\r\nthat day, I had scarcely once thought of her, but now obeying some\r\nunconscious impulse my feet had found the familiar way to her door. I\r\nwas told that the family were at dinner, but word was sent out that I\r\nshould join them at table. Besides the family, I found several guests\r\npresent, all known to me. The table glittered with plate and costly\r\nchina. The ladies were sumptuously dressed and wore the jewels of\r\nqueens. The scene was one of costly elegance and lavish luxury. The\r\ncompany was in excellent spirits, and there was plentiful laughter and\r\na running fire of jests.\r\n\r\nTo me it was as if, in wandering through the place of doom, my blood\r\nturned to tears by its sights, and my spirit attuned to sorrow, pity,\r\nand despair, I had happened in some glade upon a merry party of\r\nroisterers. I sat in silence until Edith began to rally me upon my\r\nsombre looks, What ailed me? The others presently joined in the\r\nplayful assault, and I became a target for quips and jests. Where had\r\nI been, and what had I seen to make such a dull fellow of me?\r\n\r\n"I have been in Golgotha," at last I answered. "I have seen Humanity\r\nhanging on a cross! Do none of you know what sights the sun and stars\r\nlook down on in this city, that you can think and talk of anything\r\nelse? Do you not know that close to your doors a great multitude of\r\nmen and women, flesh of your flesh, live lives that are one agony from\r\nbirth to death? Listen! their dwellings are so near that if you hush\r\nyour laughter you will hear their grievous voices, the piteous crying\r\nof the little ones that suckle poverty, the hoarse curses of men\r\nsodden in misery, turned half-way back to brutes, the chaffering of an\r\narmy of women selling themselves for bread. With what have you stopped\r\nyour ears that you do not hear these doleful sounds? For me, I can\r\nhear nothing else."\r\n\r\nSilence followed my words. A passion of pity had shaken me as I spoke,\r\nbut when I looked around upon the company, I saw that, far from being\r\nstirred as I was, their faces expressed a cold and hard astonishment,\r\nmingled in Edith\'s with extreme mortification, in her father\'s with\r\nanger. The ladies were exchanging scandalized looks, while one of the\r\ngentlemen had put up his eyeglass and was studying me with an air of\r\nscientific curiosity, When I saw that things which were to me so\r\nintolerable moved them not at all, that words that melted my heart to\r\nspeak had only offended them with the speaker, I was at first stunned\r\nand then overcome with a desperate sickness and faintness at the\r\nheart. What hope was there for the wretched, for the world, if\r\nthoughtful men and tender women were not moved by things like these!\r\nThen I bethought myself that it must be because I had not spoken\r\naright. No doubt I had put the case badly. They were angry because\r\nthey thought I was berating them, when God knew I was merely thinking\r\nof the horror of the fact without any attempt to assign the\r\nresponsibility for it.\r\n\r\nI restrained my passion, and tried to speak calmly and logically that\r\nI might correct this impression. I told them that I had not meant to\r\naccuse them, as if they, or the rich in general, were responsible for\r\nthe misery of the world. True indeed it was, that the superfluity\r\nwhich they wasted would, otherwise bestowed, relieve much bitter\r\nsuffering. These costly viands, these rich wines, these gorgeous\r\nfabrics and glistening jewels represented the ransom of many lives.\r\nThey were verily not without the guiltiness of those who waste in a\r\nland stricken with famine. Nevertheless, all the waste of all the\r\nrich, were it saved, would go but a little way to cure the poverty of\r\nthe world. There was so little to divide that even if the rich went\r\nshare and share with the poor, there would be but a common fare of\r\ncrusts, albeit made very sweet then by brotherly love.\r\n\r\nThe folly of men, not their hard-heartedness, was the great cause of\r\nthe world\'s poverty. It was not the crime of man, nor of any class of\r\nmen, that made the race so miserable, but a hideous, ghastly mistake,\r\na colossal world-darkening blunder. And then I showed them how four\r\nfifths of the labor of men was utterly wasted by the mutual warfare,\r\nthe lack of organization and concert among the workers. Seeking to\r\nmake the matter very plain, I instanced the case of arid lands where\r\nthe soil yielded the means of life only by careful use of the\r\nwatercourses for irrigation. I showed how in such countries it was\r\ncounted the most important function of the government to see that the\r\nwater was not wasted by the selfishness or ignorance of individuals,\r\nsince otherwise there would be famine. To this end its use was\r\nstrictly regulated and systematized, and individuals of their mere\r\ncaprice were not permitted to dam it or divert it, or in any way to\r\ntamper with it.\r\n\r\nThe labor of men, I explained, was the fertilizing stream which alone\r\nrendered earth habitable. It was but a scanty stream at best, and its\r\nuse required to be regulated by a system which expended every drop to\r\nthe best advantage, if the world were to be supported in abundance.\r\nBut how far from any system was the actual practice! Every man wasted\r\nthe precious fluid as he wished, animated only by the equal motives of\r\nsaving his own crop and spoiling his neighbor\'s, that his might sell\r\nthe better. What with greed and what with spite some fields were\r\nflooded while others were parched, and half the water ran wholly to\r\nwaste. In such a land, though a few by strength or cunning might win\r\nthe means of luxury, the lot of the great mass must be poverty, and of\r\nthe weak and ignorant bitter want and perennial famine.\r\n\r\nLet but the famine-stricken nation assume the function it had\r\nneglected, and regulate for the common good the course of the\r\nlife-giving stream, and the earth would bloom like one garden, and\r\nnone of its children lack any good thing. I described the physical\r\nfelicity, mental enlightenment, and moral elevation which would then\r\nattend the lives of all men. With fervency I spoke of that new world,\r\nblessed with plenty, purified by justice and sweetened by brotherly\r\nkindness, the world of which I had indeed but dreamed, but which might\r\nso easily be made real. But when I had expected now surely the faces\r\naround me to light up with emotions akin to mine, they grew ever more\r\ndark, angry, and scornful. Instead of enthusiasm, the ladies showed\r\nonly aversion and dread, while the men interrupted me with shouts of\r\nreprobation and contempt. "Madman!" "Pestilent fellow!" "Fanatic!"\r\n"Enemy of society!" were some of their cries, and the one who had\r\nbefore taken his eyeglass to me exclaimed, "He says we are to have no\r\nmore poor. Ha! ha!"\r\n\r\n"Put the fellow out!" exclaimed the father of my betrothed, and at the\r\nsignal the men sprang from their chairs and advanced upon me.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that my heart would burst with the anguish of finding\r\nthat what was to me so plain and so all-important was to them\r\nmeaningless, and that I was powerless to make it other. So hot had\r\nbeen my heart that I had thought to melt an iceberg with its glow,\r\nonly to find at last the overmastering chill seizing my own vitals. It\r\nwas not enmity that I felt toward them as they thronged me, but pity\r\nonly, for them and for the world.\r\n\r\nAlthough despairing, I could not give over. Still I strove with them.\r\nTears poured from my eyes. In my vehemence I became inarticulate. I\r\npanted, I sobbed, I groaned, and immediately afterward found myself\r\nsitting upright in bed in my room in Dr. Leete\'s house, and the\r\nmorning sun shining through the open window into my eyes. I was\r\ngasping. The tears were streaming down my face, and I quivered in\r\nevery nerve.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nAs with an escaped convict who dreams that he has been recaptured and\r\nbrought back to his dark and reeking dungeon, and opens his eyes to\r\nsee the heaven\'s vault spread above him, so it was with me, as I\r\nrealized that my return to the nineteenth century had been the dream,\r\nand my presence in the twentieth was the reality.\r\n\r\nThe cruel sights which I had witnessed in my vision, and could so well\r\nconfirm from the experience of my former life, though they had, alas!\r\nonce been, and must in the retrospect to the end of time move the\r\ncompassionate to tears, were, God be thanked, forever gone by. Long\r\nago oppressor and oppressed, prophet and scorner, had been dust. For\r\ngenerations, rich and poor had been forgotten words.\r\n\r\nBut in that moment, while yet I mused with unspeakable thankfulness\r\nupon the greatness of the world\'s salvation and my privilege in\r\nbeholding it, there suddenly pierced me like a knife a pang of shame,\r\nremorse, and wondering self-reproach, that bowed my head upon my\r\nbreast and made me wish the grave had hid me with my fellows from the\r\nsun. For I had been a man of that former time. What had I done to help\r\non the deliverance whereat I now presumed to rejoice? I who had lived\r\nin those cruel, insensate days, what had I done to bring them to an\r\nend? I had been every whit as indifferent to the wretchedness of my\r\nbrothers, as cynically incredulous of better things, as besotted a\r\nworshipper of Chaos and Old Night, as any of my fellows. So far as my\r\npersonal influence went, it had been exerted rather to hinder than to\r\nhelp forward the enfranchisement of the race which was even then\r\npreparing. What right had I to hail a salvation which reproached me,\r\nto rejoice in a day whose dawning I had mocked?\r\n\r\n"Better for you, better for you," a voice within me rang, "had this\r\nevil dream been the reality, and this fair reality the dream; better\r\nyour part pleading for crucified humanity with a scoffing generation,\r\nthan here, drinking of wells you digged not, and eating of trees whose\r\nhusbandmen you stoned;" and my spirit answered, "Better, truly."\r\n\r\nWhen at length I raised my bowed head and looked forth from the\r\nwindow, Edith, fresh as the morning, had come into the garden and was\r\ngathering flowers. I hastened to descend to her. Kneeling before her,\r\nwith my face in the dust, I confessed with tears how little was my\r\nworth to breathe the air of this golden century, and how infinitely\r\nless to wear upon my breast its consummate flower. Fortunate is he\r\nwho, with a case so desperate as mine, finds a judge so merciful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\nTHE RATE OF THE WORLD\'S PROGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the Boston Transcript_: The Transcript of March 30,\r\n1888, contained a review of _Looking Backward_, in response to which I\r\nbeg to be allowed a word. The description to which the book is\r\ndevoted, of the radically new social and industrial institutions and\r\narrangements supposed to be enjoyed by the people of the United States\r\nin the twentieth century, is not objected to as depicting a degree of\r\nhuman felicity and moral development necessarily unattainable by the\r\nrace, provided time enough had been allowed for its evolution from the\r\npresent chaotic state of society. In failing to allow this, the\r\nreviewer thinks that the author has made an absurd mistake, which\r\nseriously detracts from the value of the book as a work of realistic\r\nimagination. Instead of placing the realization of the ideal social\r\nstate a scant fifty years ahead, it is suggested that he should have\r\nmade his figure seventy-five centuries. There is certainly a large\r\ndiscrepancy between seventy-five centuries and fifty years, and if the\r\nreviewer is correct in his estimate of the probable rate of human\r\nprogress, the outlook of the world is decidedly discouraging. But is\r\nhe right? I think not.\r\n\r\n_Looking Backward_, although in form a fanciful romance, is intended,\r\nin all seriousness, as a forecast, in accordance with the principles\r\nof evolution, of the next stage in the industrial and social\r\ndevelopment of humanity, especially in this country; and no part of it\r\nis believed by the author to be better supported by the indications of\r\nprobability than the implied prediction that the dawn of the new era\r\nis already near at hand, and that the full day will swiftly follow.\r\nDoes this seem at first thought incredible, in view of the vastness of\r\nthe changes presupposed? What is the teaching of history, but that\r\ngreat national transformations, while ages in unnoticed preparation,\r\nwhen once inaugurated, are accomplished with a rapidity and resistless\r\nmomentum proportioned to their magnitude, not limited by it?\r\n\r\nIn 1759, when Quebec fell, the might of England in America seemed\r\nirresistible, and the vassalage of the colonies assured. Nevertheless,\r\nthirty years later, the first President of the American Republic was\r\ninaugurated. In 1849, after Novara, Italian prospects appeared as\r\nhopeless as at any time since the Middle Ages; yet only fifteen years\r\nafter, Victor Emmanuel was crowned King of United Italy. In 1864, the\r\nfulfillment of the thousand-year dream of German unity was apparently\r\nas far off as ever. Seven years later it had been realized, and\r\nWilliam had assumed at Versailles the Crown of Barbarossa. In 1832,\r\nthe original Anti-slavery Society was formed in Boston by a few\r\nso-called visionaries. Thirty-eight years later, in 1870, the society\r\ndisbanded, its programme fully carried out.\r\n\r\nThese precedents do not, of course, prove that any such industrial and\r\nsocial transformation as is outlined in _Looking Backward_ is\r\nimpending; but they do show that, when the moral and economical\r\nconditions for it are ripe, it may be expected to go forward with\r\ngreat rapidity. On no other stage are the scenes shifted with a\r\nswiftness so like magic as on the great stage of history when once the\r\nhour strikes. The question is not, then, how extensive the\r\nscene-shifting must be to set the stage for the new fraternal\r\ncivilization, but whether there are any special indications that a\r\nsocial transformation is at hand. The causes that have been bringing\r\nit ever nearer have been at work from immemorial time. To the stream\r\nof tendency setting toward an ultimate realization of a form of\r\nsociety which, while vastly more efficient for material prosperity,\r\nshould also satisfy and not outrage the moral instincts, every sigh of\r\npoverty, every tear of pity, every humane impulse, every generous\r\nenthusiasm, every true religious feeling, every act by which men have\r\ngiven effect to their mutual sympathy by drawing more closely together\r\nfor any purpose, have contributed from the beginnings of\r\ncivilization. That this long stream of influence, ever widening and\r\ndeepening, is at last about to sweep away the barriers it has so long\r\nsapped, is at least one obvious interpretation of the present\r\nuniversal ferment of men\'s minds as to the imperfections of present\r\nsocial arrangements. Not only are the toilers of the world engaged in\r\nsomething like a world-wide insurrection, but true and humane men and\r\nwomen, of every degree, are in a mood of exasperation, verging on\r\nabsolute revolt, against social conditions that reduce life to a\r\nbrutal struggle for existence, mock every dictate of ethics and\r\nreligion, and render wellnigh futile the efforts of philanthropy.\r\n\r\nAs an iceberg, floating southward from the frozen North, is gradually\r\nundermined by warmer seas, and, become at last unstable, churns the\r\nsea to yeast for miles around by the mighty rockings that portend its\r\noverturn, so the barbaric industrial and social system, which has come\r\ndown to us from savage antiquity, undermined by the modern humane\r\nspirit, riddled by the criticism of economic science, is shaking the\r\nworld with convulsions that presage its collapse.\r\n\r\nAll thoughtful men agree that the present aspect of society is\r\nportentous of great changes. The only question is, whether they will\r\nbe for the better or the worse. Those who believe in man\'s essential\r\nnobleness lean to the former view, those who believe in his essential\r\nbaseness to the latter. For my part, I hold to the former opinion.\r\n_Looking Backward_ was written in the belief that the Golden Age lies\r\nbefore us and not behind us, and is not far away. Our children will\r\nsurely see it, and we, too, who are already men and women, if we\r\ndeserve it by our faith and by our works.\r\n\r\n                                   EDWARD BELLAMY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Looking Backward, by Edward Bellamy\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LOOKING BACKWARD ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 25439.txt or 25439.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/2/5/4/3/25439/\r\n\r\nProduced by Jana Srna, David T.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
