This bridge\r\nwas on the highroad between Lima and Cuzco and hundreds of persons\r\npassed over it every day. It had been woven of osier by the Incas more\r\nthan a century before and visitors to the city were always led out to\r\nsee it. It was a mere ladder of thin slats swung out over the gorge,\r\nwith handrails of dried vine. Horses and coaches and chairs had to go\r\ndown hundreds of feet below and pass over the narrow torrent on rafts,\r\nbut no one, not even the Viceroy, not even the Archbishop of Lima, had\r\ndescended with the baggage rather than cross by the famous bridge of San\r\nLuis Rey. St. Louis of France himself protected it, by his name and by\r\nthe little mud church on the further side. The bridge seemed to be among\r\nthe things that last forever; it was unthinkable that it should break.\r\nThe moment a Peruvian heard of the accident he signed himself and made a\r\nmental calculation as to how recently he had crossed by it and how soon\r\nhe had intended crossing by it again. People wandered about in a\r\ntrance-like state, muttering; they had the hallucination of seeing\r\nthemselves falling into a gulf.\r\n\r\nThere was a great service in the Cathedral. The bodies of the victims\r\nwere approximately collected and approximately separated from one\r\nanother, and there was great searching of hearts in the beautiful city\r\nof Lima. Servant girls returned bracelets which they had stolen from\r\ntheir mistresses, and usurers harangued their wives angrily, in defense\r\nof usury. Yet it was rather strange that this event should have so\r\nimpressed the Limeans, for in that country those catastrophes which\r\nlawyers shockingly call the "acts of God" were more than usually\r\nfrequent. Tidal waves were continually washing away cities; earthquakes\r\narrived every week and towers fell upon good men and women all the time.\r\nDiseases were forever flitting in and out of the provinces and old age\r\ncarried away some of the most admirable citizens. That is why it was so\r\nsurprising that the Peruvians should have been especially touched by the\r\nrent in the bridge of San Luis Rey.\r\n\r\nEveryone was very deeply impressed, but only one person did anything\r\nabout it, and that was Brother Juniper. By a series of coincidences so\r\nextraordinary that one almost suspects the presence of some Intention,\r\nthis little red-haired Franciscan from Northern Italy happened to be in\r\nPeru converting the Indians and happened to witness the accident.\r\n\r\nIt was a very hot noon, that fatal noon, and coming around the shoulder\r\nof a hill Brother Juniper stopped to wipe his forehead and to gaze upon\r\nthe screen of snowy peaks in the distance, then into the gorge below him\r\nfilled with the dark plumage of green trees and green birds and\r\ntraversed by its ladder of osier. Joy was in him; things were not going\r\nbadly. He had opened several little abandoned churches and the Indians\r\nwere crawling in to early Mass and groaning at the moment of miracle as\r\nthough their hearts would break. Perhaps it was the pure air from the\r\nsnows before him; perhaps it was the memory that brushed him for a\r\nmoment of the poem that bade him raise his eyes to the helpful hills. At\r\nall events he felt at peace. Then his glance fell upon the bridge, and\r\nat that moment a twanging noise filled the air, as when the string of\r\nsome musical instrument snaps in a disused room, and he saw the bridge\r\ndivide and fling five gesticulating ants into the valley below.\r\n\r\nAnyone else would have said to himself with secret joy: "Within ten\r\nminutes myself...!" But it was another thought that visited Brother\r\nJuniper: "Why did thin happen to _those_ five?" If there were any plan\r\nin the universe at all, if there were any pattern in a human life,\r\nsurely it could be discovered mysteriously latent in those lives so\r\nsuddenly cut off. Either we live by accident and die by accident, or we\r\nlive by plan and die by plan, And on that instant Brother Juniper made\r\nthe resolve to inquire into the secret lives of those five persons, that\r\nmoment falling through the air, and to surprise the reason of their\r\ntaking off.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Brother Juniper that it was high time for theology to take\r\nits place among the exact sciences and he had long intended putting it\r\nthere. What he had lacked hitherto was a laboratory. Oh, there had never\r\nbeen any lack of specimens; any number of his charges had met\r\ncalamity,--spiders had stung them; their lungs had been touched; their\r\nhouses had burned down and things had happened to their children from\r\nwhich one averts the mind. But these occasions of human woe had never\r\nbeen quite fit for scientific examination. They had lacked what our good\r\nsavants were later to call _proper control_. The accident had been\r\ndependent upon human error, for example, or had contained elements of\r\nprobability. But this collapse of the bridge of San Luis Rey was a sheer\r\nAct of God. It afforded a perfect laboratory. Here at last one could\r\nsurprise His intentions in a pure state.\r\n\r\nYou and I can see that coming from anyone but Brother Juniper this plan\r\nwould be the flower of a perfect skepticism. It resembled the effort of\r\nthose presumptuous souls who wanted to walk on the pavements of Heaven\r\nand built the Tower of Babel to get there. But to our Franciscan there\r\nwas no element of doubt in the experiment. He knew the answer. He merely\r\nwanted to prove it, historically, mathematically, to his converts,--poor\r\nobstinate converts, so slow to believe that their pains were inserted\r\ninto their lives for their own good. People were always asking for good\r\nsound proofs; doubt springs eternal in the human breast, even in\r\ncountries where the Inquisition can read your very thoughts in your\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nThis was not the first time that Brother Juniper had tried to resort to\r\nsuch methods. Often on the long trips he had to make (scurrying from\r\nparish to parish, his robe tucked up about his knees, for haste) he\r\nwould fall to dreaming of experiments that justify the ways of God to\r\nman. For instance, a complete record of the Prayers for Rain and their\r\nresults. Often he had stood on the steps of one of his little churches,\r\nhis flock kneeling before him on the baked street. Often he had\r\nstretched his arms to the sky and declaimed the splendid ritual. Not\r\noften, but several times, he had felt the virtue enter him and seen the\r\nlittle cloud forming on the horizon. But there were many times when\r\nweeks went by ... but why think of them? It was not himself he was\r\ntrying to convince that rain and drought were wisely apportioned.\r\n\r\nThus it was that the determination rose within him at the moment of the\r\naccident. It prompted him to busy himself for six years, knocking at all\r\nthe doors in Lima, asking thousands of questions, filling scores of\r\nnotebooks, in his effort at establishing the fact that each of the five\r\nlost lives was a perfect whole. Everyone knew that he was working on\r\nsome sort of memorial of the accident and everyone was very helpful and\r\nmisleading. A few even knew the principal aim of his activity and there\r\nwere patrons in high places.\r\n\r\nThe result of all this diligence was an enormous book, which as we shall\r\nsee later, was publicly burned on a beautiful Spring morning in the\r\ngreat square. But there was a secret copy and after a great many years\r\nand without much notice it found its way to the library of the\r\nUniversity of San Marco. There it lies between two great wooden covers\r\ncollecting dust in a cupboard. It deals with one after another of the\r\nvictims of the accident, cataloguing thousands of little facts and\r\nanecdotes and testimonies, and concluding with a dignified passage\r\ndescribing why God had settled upon that person and upon that day for\r\nHis demonstration of wisdom. Yet for all his diligence Brother Juniper\r\nnever knew the central passion of Do\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada\'s life; nor of Uncle\r\nPio\'s, not even of Esteban\'s. And I, who claim to know so much more,\r\nisn\'t it possible that even I have missed the very spring within the\r\nspring?\r\n\r\nSome say that we shall never know and that to the gods we are like the\r\nflies that the boys kill on a summer day, and some say, on the contrary,\r\nthat the very sparrows do not lose a feather that has not been brushed\r\naway by the finger of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART TWO: THE MARQUESA DE\r\nMONTEMAYOR\r\n\r\n\r\nANY Spanish schoolboy is required to know today more about Do\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada,\r\nMarquesa de Montemayor, than Brother Juniper was to discover in years of\r\nresearch. Within a century of her death her letters had become one of\r\nthe monuments of Spanish literature and her life and times have ever\r\nsince been the object of long studies. But her biographers have erred in\r\none direction as greatly as the Franciscan did in another; they have\r\ntried to invest her with a host of graces, to read back into her life\r\nand person some of the beauties that abound in her letters, whereas all\r\nreal knowledge of this wonderful woman must proceed from the act of\r\nhumiliating her and of divesting her of all beauties save one.\r\n\r\nShe was the daughter of a cloth-merchant who had acquired the money and\r\nthe hatred of the Limeans within a stone\'s-throw of the Plaza. Her\r\nchildhood was unhappy: she was ugly; she stuttered; her mother\r\npersecuted her with sarcasms in an effort to arouse some social charms\r\nand forced her to go about the town in a veritable harness of jewels.\r\nShe lived alone and she thought alone. Many suitors presented\r\nthemselves, but as long as she could she fought against the convention\r\nof her time and was determined to remain single. There were hysterical\r\nscenes with her mother, recriminations, screams and slamming of doors.\r\nAt last at twenty-six she found herself penned into marriage with a\r\nsupercilious and ruined nobleman and the Cathedral of Lima fairly buzzed\r\nwith the sneers of her guests. Still she lived alone and thought alone,\r\nand when an exquisite daughter was born to her she fastened upon her an\r\nidolatrous love. But little Clara took after her father; she was cold\r\nand intellectual. At the age of eight she was calmly correcting her\r\nmother\'s speech and presently regarding her with astonishment and\r\nrepulsion. The frightened mother became meek and obsequious but she\r\ncould not prevent herself from persecuting Do\xc3\xb1a Clara with nervous\r\nattention and a fatiguing love. Again there were hysterical\r\nrecriminations, screams and slamming of doors. From the offers of\r\nmarriage that fell to her, Do\xc3\xb1a Clara deliberately chose the one that\r\nrequired her removal to Spain. So to Spain she went, to that land from\r\nwhich it takes six months to receive an answer to one\'s letter. The\r\nleave-taking before so long a voyage became in Peru one of the formal\r\nservices of the Church. The ship was blessed and as the space widened\r\nbetween the vessel and the beach both companies knelt and sang a hymn\r\nthat never failed to sound weak and timid in all that open air. Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nClara sailed with most admirable composure, leaving her mother to gaze\r\nafter the bright ship, her hand pressing now her heart and now her\r\nmouth. Blurred and streaked became her view of the serene Pacific and\r\nthe enormous clouds of pearl that hang forever motionless above it.\r\n\r\nLeft alone in Lima the Marquesa\'s life grew more and more inward. She\r\nbecame increasingly negligent in her dress and like all lonely people\r\nshe talked to herself audibly. All her existence lay in the burning\r\ncenter of her mind. On that stage were performed endless dialogues with\r\nher daughter, impossible reconciliations, scenes eternally recommenced\r\nof remorse and forgiveness. On the street you beheld an old woman her\r\nred wig fallen a little over one ear, her left cheek angry with a\r\nleprous affection, her right with a complementary adjustment of rouge.\r\nHer chin was never dry; her lips were never still. Lima was a city of\r\neccentrics, but even there she became its jest as she drove through the\r\nstreets or shuffled up the steps of its churches. She was thought to be\r\ncontinuously drunk. Worse things were said of her and petitions were\r\nafloat that she be locked up. She had been denounced three times before\r\nthe Inquisition. It is not impossible that she might have been burned\r\nhad her son-in-law been less influential in Spain and had she not\r\nsomehow collected a few friends about the viceregal court who suffered\r\nher for her oddity and her wide reading.\r\n\r\nThe distressing character of the relations between mother and daughter\r\nwere further embittered by misunderstandings over money. The Condesa\r\nreceived a handsome allowance from her mother and frequent gifts. Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nClara soon became the outstanding woman of intelligence at the Spanish\r\ncourt. All the wealth of Peru would have been insufficient to maintain\r\nher in the grandiose style she fancied for herself. Strangely enough her\r\nextravagance proceeded from one of the best traits in her nature: she\r\nregarded her friends, her servants and all the interesting people in the\r\ncapital, as her children. In fact there seemed only one person in the\r\nworld towards whom she did not expend herself in kind offices. Among her\r\n_prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9s_ was the cartographer De Blasiis (whose _Maps of the New\r\nWorld_ was dedicated to the Marquesa de Montemayor amid the roars of the\r\ncourtiers at Lima who read that she was the "_admiration of her city and\r\na rising sun in the West_"); another was the scientist Azuarius whose\r\ntreatise on the laws of hydraulics was suppressed by the Inquisition as\r\nbeing too exciting. For a decade the Condesa literally sustained all the\r\narts and sciences of Spain; it was not her fault that nothing memorable\r\nwas produced in that time.\r\n\r\nAbout four years after Do\xc3\xb1a Clara\'s departure Do\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada received her\r\npermission to visit Europe. On both sides the visit was anticipated with\r\nresolutions well nourished on self-reproach: the one to be patient, the\r\nother to be undemonstrative. Both failed. Each tortured the other and\r\nwas on the point of losing her mind under the alternations of\r\nself-rebuke and the outbursts of passion. At length one day Do\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada\r\nrose before dawn, daring no more than to kiss the door behind which her\r\ndaughter was sleeping, took ship and returned to America. Henceforth\r\nletter-writing had to take the place of all the affection that could not\r\nbe lived.\r\n\r\nHers were the letters that in an astonishing world have become the\r\ntext-book of schoolboys and the ant-hill of the grammarians. Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nMar\xc3\xada would have invented her genius had she not been born with it, so\r\nnecessary was it to her love that she attract the attention, perhaps the\r\nadmiration, of her distant child. She forced herself to go out into\r\nsociety in order to cull its ridicules; she taught her eye to observe;\r\nshe read the masterpieces of her language to discover its effects; she\r\ninsinuated herself into the company of those who were celebrated for\r\ntheir conversation. Night after night in her baroque palace she wrote\r\nand rewrote the incredible pages, forcing from her despairing mind those\r\nmiracles of wit and grace, those distilled chronicles of the viceregal\r\ncourt. We know now that her daughter barely glanced at the letters and\r\nthat it is to the son-in-law that we owe their preservation.\r\n\r\nThe Marquesa would have been astonished to learn that her letters were\r\nimmortal. Yet many critics have accused her of keeping one eye on\r\nposterity and point to a number of letters that have all the air of\r\nbeing bravura pieces. To them it seems impossible that Do\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada\r\nshould have put herself to the same pains to dazzle her daughter that\r\nmost artists expend on dazzling the public. Like her son-in-law they\r\nmisunderstood her: the Conde delighted in her letters, but he thought\r\nthat when he had enjoyed the style he had extracted all their richness\r\nand intention, missing (as most readers do) the whole purport of\r\nliterature, which is the notation of the heart. Style is but the faintly\r\ncontemptible vessel in which the bitter liquid is recommended to the\r\nworld. The Marquesa would even have been astonished to learn that her\r\nletters were very good, for such authors live always in the noble\r\nweather of their own minds and those productions which seem remarkable\r\nto us are little better than a day\'s routine to them.\r\n\r\nThis was the old woman who hour by hour would sit upon her balcony, her\r\nodd straw hat casting a purple shadow across her lined and yellow face.\r\nHow often as she turned her pages with her gemmed hands, she would ask\r\nherself, almost with amusement, whether the constant pain at her heart\r\nhad an organic seat. She wondered whether a subtle doctor cutting\r\nthrough to that battered throne could at last discover a sign and\r\nlifting his face to the amphitheatre cry out to his students: "This\r\nwoman has suffered, and her suffering has left its mark upon the\r\nstructure of her heart." This idea had so often visited her that one day\r\nshe wrote it into a letter and her daughter scolded her for an\r\nintrospective and for making a cult of sorrow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe knowledge that she would never be loved in return acted upon her\r\nideas as a tide acts upon cliffs. Her religious beliefs went first, for\r\nall she could ask of a god, or of immortality, was the gift of a place\r\nwhere daughters love their mothers; the other attributes of Heaven you\r\ncould have for a song. Next she lost her belief in the sincerity of\r\nthose about her. She secretly refused to believe that anyone (herself\r\nexcepted) loved anyone. All families lived in a wasteful atmosphere of\r\ncustom and kissed one another with secret indifference. She saw that the\r\npeople of this world moved about in an armour of egotism, drunk with\r\nself-gazing, athirst for compliments, hearing little of what was said to\r\nthem, unmoved by the accidents that befell their closest friends, in\r\ndread of all appeals that might interrupt their long communion with\r\ntheir own desires. These were the sons and daughters of Adam from Cathay\r\nto Peru. And when on the balcony her thoughts reached this turn, her\r\nmouth would contract with shame for she knew that she too sinned and\r\nthat though her love for her daughter was vast enough to include all the\r\ncolours of love, it was not without a shade of tyranny: she loved her\r\ndaughter not for her daughter\'s sake, but for her own. She longed to\r\nfree herself from this ignoble bond; but the passion was too fierce to\r\ncope with. And then on that green balcony a strange warfare would shake\r\nthe hideous old lady, a singularly futile struggle against a temptation\r\nto which she would never have the opportunity of succumbing. How could\r\nshe rule her daughter when her daughter saw to it that four thousand\r\nmiles lay between them? Nevertheless Do\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada wrestled with the\r\nghost of her temptation and was worsted on every occasion. She wanted\r\nher daughter for herself; she wanted to hear her say: "You are the best\r\nof all possible mothers"; she longed to hear her whisper: "Forgive me."\r\n\r\nAbout two years after her return from Spain there took place a series of\r\ninconspicuous events that had a great deal to tell about the inner life\r\nof the Marquesa. Only the faintest allusion to them occurs in the\r\nCorrespondence, but as that is found in Letter XXII which contains other\r\nsigns I shall do my best to give a translation and commentary of the\r\nfirst part of the letter:\r\n\r\n"_Are there no doctors in Spain? Where are those good men from Flanders\r\nthat used to help you so? Oh, my treasure, how can we punish you enough\r\nfor letting your cold endure so many weeks? Don Vicente, I implore you\r\nto make my child see reason. Angels of Heaven, I implore you to make my\r\nchild see reason. Now that you are better, I beg of you, resolve that\r\nwhen the first warning of a cold comes you will steam yourself well and\r\ngo to bed. Here in Peru I am helpless; I can do nothing. Do not be\r\nself-willed, beloved. God bless you. I am enclosing in today\'s packet\r\nthe gum of some tree which the sisters of San Tom\xc3\xa1s peddle from door to\r\ndoor. Whether it be of much use I know not. It can do no harm. I am told\r\nthat in the convent the silly sisters inhale it so diligently that one\r\ncannot smell the incense at Mass. Whether it be worth anything I know\r\nnot; try it._\r\n\r\n"_Rest easy, my love, I am sending His Mos. Catholic Majesty the perfect\r\ngold chain_." (Her daughter had written her: "_The chain arrived in good\r\ncondition and I wore it at the christening of the Infante. His Most\r\nCatholic Majesty was gracious enough to admire it and when I told Him\r\nthat you had given it me He sent you His compliments upon your taste. Do\r\nnot fail to send Him one as like it as possible; send it at once, by way\r\nof the Chamberlain.") "He need never know that in order to obtain it I\r\nhad to walk into a picture. Do you remember that in the sacristy of San\r\nMart\xc3\xadn there is a portrait by Velasquez of the Viceroy who founded the\r\nmonastery and of his wife and brat? and that his wife is wearing a gold\r\nchain? I resolved that only that chain would do. So one midnight I\r\nslipped into the sacristy, climbed upon the robing-table like a girl of\r\ntwelve and walked in. The canvas resisted for a moment, but the painter\r\nhimself came forward to lift me through the pigment. I told him that the\r\nmost beautiful girl in Spain wished to present the finest gold chain\r\nthat could be found to the most gracious king in the world. It was as\r\nsimple as that, and there we stood talking, we four, in the gray and\r\nsilvery air that makes a Velasquez. Now I keep thinking about a more\r\ngolden light; I keep looking at the Palace: I must pass the evening in a\r\nTitian. Would the Viceroy let me?_\r\n\r\n"_But His Excellency has the gout again. I say \'again\' because the\r\nflattery of the court insists that there are times when he is free of\r\nit. This being Saint Mark\'s day His Excellency started out to visit the\r\nUniversity where twenty-two new doctors were being brought into the\r\nworld. He had hardly been carried from his divan to his coach when he\r\nscreamed and refused to go any farther. He was carried back to his bed\r\nwhere he broke a most delicious cigar and sent for the Perichole. And\r\nwhile we listened to long doctrinal addresses, more or less in Latin, he\r\nheard all about us, more or less in Spanish, from the reddest and\r\ncruellest lips in town_." (Do\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada permitted herself this passage,\r\nalthough she had just read in her daughter\'s last letter: "_How many\r\ntimes must I tell you to be more cautious in the things you say in your\r\nletters? They often show signs of having been opened on the journey.\r\nNothing could be more ill-judged than your remarks on the\r\nyou-know-what-I-mean at Cuzco. Such remarks are not funny, even though\r\nVicente did compliment you upon them in his postscript, and they might\r\nget us into a great deal of trouble with Certain Persons here in Spain.\r\nI continue to be astonished that your indiscretions have not long since\r\nled to your being ordered to retire to your farm_.")\r\n\r\n"_There was a great press at the Exercises and two women fell from the\r\nbalcony, but God in His goodness saw that they fell on Do\xc3\xb1a Merced. All\r\nthree are badly hurt, but will be thinking of other things within a\r\nyear. The President was speaking at the moment of the accident and being\r\nshort-sighted could not imagine what the disturbance of cries and talk\r\nand falling bodies could be about. It was very pleasant to see him\r\nbowing, under the impression that he was being applauded._\r\n\r\n"_Speaking of the Perichole, and of applause, you should know that\r\nPepita and I decided to go to the Comedia this evening. The public still\r\nidolizes its Perichole; it even forgives her her years. We are told that\r\nshe saves what she can, every morning, by passing alternate pencils of\r\nice and fire across her cheeks_." (Translation falls especially short of\r\nthis conceit which carries the whole flamboyance of the Spanish\r\nlanguage. It was intended as an obsequious flattery of the Condesa, and\r\nwas untrue. The great actress was twenty-eight at this time; her cheeks\r\nhad the smoothness and polish of dark yellow marble and would certainly\r\nhave retained that quality for many years. Apart from the cosmetics\r\nrequired by her performances the only treatment Camila Perichole\r\nafforded her face was to throw cold water at it twice a day, like a\r\npeasant woman at a horse trough.) "_That curious man they call Uncle Pio\r\nis by her all the time. Don Rub\xc3\xado says that he cannot make out whether\r\nUncle Pio is her father, her lover, or her son. The Perichole gave a\r\nwonderful performance. Scold me all you like for a provincial ninny, you\r\nhave no such actresses in Spain_." And so on.\r\n\r\nIt is on this visit to the theatre that further matter hangs. She\r\ndecided to go to the Comedia where the Perichole was playing Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nLeonor in Moreto\'s _Trampa Adelante_; perhaps some material could be\r\nderived from the visit for her daughter\'s next letter. She took with her\r\nPepita, a little girl about whom later we shall learn much. Do\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada\r\nhad borrowed her from the orphanage connected with the Convent of Santa\r\nMar\xc3\xada Rosa de las Rosas to be her companion. The Marquesa sat in her\r\nbox gazing with flagging attention at the brilliant stage. Between the\r\nacts it was the Perichole\'s custom to lay aside the courtly r\xc3\xb4le and\r\nappear before the curtain to sing a few topical songs. The malicious\r\nactress had seen the Marquesa arrive and presently began improvising\r\ncouplets alluding to her appearance, her avarice, her drunkenness, and\r\neven to her daughter\'s flight from her. The attention of the house was\r\nsubtly directed to the old woman and a rising murmur of contempt\r\naccompanied the laughter of the audience. But the Marquesa, deeply moved\r\nby the first two acts of the comedy, scarcely saw the singer and sat\r\nstaring before her, thinking about Spain. Camila Perichole became bolder\r\nand the air was electric with the hatred and glee of the crowd. At last\r\nPepita plucked the Marquesa\'s sleeve and whispered to her that they\r\nshould go. As they left the box the house arose and burst into a roar of\r\ntriumph; the Perichole flung herself into a frenzied dance, for she saw\r\nthe manager at the back of the hall and knew that her salary had been\r\nincreased. But the Marquesa remained unaware of what had taken place; in\r\nfact she was quite pleased, for during the visit she had contrived a few\r\nfelicitous phrases, phrases (who knows) that might bring a smile to her\r\ndaughter\'s face and might make her murmur: "Really, my mother is\r\ncharming."\r\n\r\nIn due time the report reached the Viceroy\'s ears that one of his\r\naristocrats had been openly baited in the theatre. He summoned the\r\nPerichole to the Palace and ordered her to call upon the Marquesa and to\r\napologize. The trip was to be made barefoot and in a black dress. Camila\r\nargued and fought, but all she gained was a pair of shoes.\r\n\r\nThe Viceroy had three reasons for insisting. In the first place the\r\nsinger had taken liberties with his court. Don Andr\xc3\xa9s had contrived to\r\nmake exile endurable by building up a ceremonial so complicated that it\r\ncould be remembered only by a society that had nothing else to think\r\nabout. He nursed his little aristocracy and its minute distinctions and\r\nany insult paid to a Marquesa was an insult to His Person. In the second\r\nplace, Do\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada\'s son-in-law was an increasingly important personage\r\nin Spain, laden with possibilities of injury to the Viceroy, nay with\r\nthe possibility of supplanting him. The Conde Vicente d\'Abuirre must not\r\nbe vexed, even through his half-wit mother-in-law. Finally, the Viceroy\r\nwas delighted to humble the actress. He suspected that she was deceiving\r\nhim with a matador, perhaps with an actor,--between the flattery of the\r\ncourt and the inertia of gout he could not quite make out who it was; at\r\nall events, it was clear that the singer was beginning to forget that he\r\nwas one of the first men in the world.\r\n\r\nThe Marquesa, beside not having heard the scurrilous songs, was in other\r\nways unprepared for the actress\'s visit. You should know that after the\r\ndeparture of her daughter, Do\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada had lighted upon a certain\r\nconsolation: she had taken to drinking. Everyone drank _chicha_ in Peru\r\nand there was no particular disgrace in being found unconscious on a\r\nfeast day. Do\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada had begun to discover that her feverish\r\nmonologues had a way of keeping her awake all night. Once she took a\r\ndelicate fluted glassful of _chicha_ on retiring. Oblivion was so sweet\r\nthat presently she stole larger amounts and tried dissimulating their\r\neffects from Pepita; she hinted that she was not well, and represented\r\nherself as going into a decline. At last she resigned all pretense. The\r\nboats that carried her letter to Spain did not leave oftener than once a\r\nmonth. During the week that preceded the making of the packet she\r\nobserved a strict regimen and cultivated the city assiduously for\r\nmaterial. At last on the eve of the post she wrote the letter, making up\r\nthe bundle towards dawn and leaving it for Pepita to deliver to the\r\nagent. Then as the sun rose she would shut herself up in her room with\r\nsome flagons and drift through the next few weeks without the burden of\r\nconsciousness. Finally she would emerge from her happiness and prepare\r\nto go into a state of "training" in preparation for the writing of\r\nanother letter.\r\n\r\nThus on the night following the scandal in the theatre she wrote Letter\r\nXXII and retired to bed with a carafe. All next day Pepita moved about\r\nthe room, glancing anxiously at the figure on the bed. The next\r\nafternoon Pepita brought her needlework into the room. The Marquesa lay\r\nstaring at the ceiling with wide-open eyes, talking to herself. Towards\r\ndusk Pepita was called to the door and informed that the Perichole had\r\ncome to see the mistress. Pepita remembered the theatre very well and\r\nsent back word angrily that the mistress refused to see her. The man\r\ncarried the message to the street door, but returned awestruck with the\r\nnews that the Se\xc3\xb1ora Perichole was armed with a letter from the Viceroy\r\npresenting her to the lady. Pepita tiptoed to the bed and started\r\ntalking to the Marquesa. The glazed eyes moved to the girl\'s face.\r\nPepita shook her gently. With great effort Do\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada tried to fix her\r\nmind on what was being said to her. Twice she lay back, refusing to\r\nseize the meaning, but at last, like a general calling together in a\r\nrain and by night the dispersed division of his army she assembled\r\nmemory and attention and a few other faculties and painfully pressing\r\nher hand to her forehead she asked for a bowl of snow. When it was\r\nbrought her, she long and drowsily pressed handfuls of it against her\r\ntemples and cheeks; then rising she stood for a long time leaning\r\nagainst the bed and looking at her shoes. At last she raised her head\r\nwith decision, she called for her fur-trimmed cloak and a veil. She put\r\nthem on and tottered into her handsomest reception room where the\r\nactress stood waiting for her.\r\n\r\nCamila had intended to be perfunctory and if possible impudent, but now\r\nshe was struck for the first time with the dignity of the old woman. The\r\nmercer\'s daughter could carry herself at times with all the distinction\r\nof the Montemayors and when she was drunk she wore the grandeur of\r\nHecuba. For Camila the half-closed eyes had the air of weary authority\r\nand she began almost timidly:\r\n\r\n"I come, se\xc3\xb1ora, to make sure that you could not have misunderstood\r\nanything I said on the evening that Your Grace did me the honour to\r\nvisit my theatre."\r\n\r\n"Misunderstood? Misunderstood?" said the Marquesa.\r\n\r\n"Your Grace might have misunderstood and thought that my words were\r\nintended to be disrespectful to Your Grace."\r\n\r\n"To me?"\r\n\r\n"Your Grace is not offended at her humble servant? Your Grace is aware\r\nthat a poor actress in my position may be carried beyond her\r\nintentions ... that it is very difficult ... that everything...."\r\n\r\n"How can I be offended, se\xc3\xb1ora? All that I can remember is that you\r\ngave a beautiful performance. You are a great artist. You should be\r\nhappy, happy. My handkerchief, Pepita...."\r\n\r\nThe Marquesa brought out these words very rapidly and vaguely, but the\r\nPerichole was confounded. A piercing sense of shame filled her. She\r\nturned crimson. At last she was able to murmur:\r\n\r\n"It was in the songs between the acts of the comedy. I was afraid Your\r\nGrace ..."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes. I remember now. I left early. Pepita, we left early, did we\r\nnot? But, se\xc3\xb1ora, you are good enough to forgive my leaving early, yes,\r\neven in the middle of your admirable performance. I forget why we left.\r\nPepita ... oh, some indisposition...."\r\n\r\nIt was impossible that anyone in the theatre could have missed the\r\nintention of the songs. Camila could only assume that the Marquesa, out\r\nof a sort of fantastic magnanimity, was playing the farce of not having\r\nnoticed it. She was almost in tears: "But you are so good to overlook my\r\nchildishness, se\xc3\xb1ora,--I mean Your Grace. I did not know. I did not\r\nknow your goodness, se\xc3\xb1ora, permit me to kiss your hand."\r\n\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada held out her hand astonished. She had not for a long time\r\nbeen addressed with such consideration. Her neighbors, her tradespeople,\r\nher servants--for even Pepita lived in awe of her,--her very daughter\r\nhad never approached her thus. It induced a new mood in her; one that\r\nmust very likely be called maudlin. She became loquacious:\r\n\r\n"Offended, offended at you, my beautiful, ... my gifted child? Who am I,\r\na ... an unwise and unloved old woman, to be offended at you? I felt, my\r\ndaughter, as though I were--what says the poet?--_surprising through a\r\ncloud the conversation of the angels_. Your voice kept finding new\r\nwonders in our Moreto. When you said:\r\n\r\n\r\n   \'_Don Juan, si mi amor estimas,\r\n     Y la fe segura es necia,\r\n     Enojarte mis temores\r\n     Es no querarme discreta.\r\n    \xc2\xbfTan seguros_....\'\r\n\r\n\r\nand so on,--that was true! And what a gesture you made at the close of\r\nthe First Day. There, with your hand so. Such a gesture as the Virgin\r\nmade, saying to Gabriel: _How is it possible that I shall have a child_?\r\nNo, no, you will begin to have resentment at me, for I am going to tell\r\nyou about a gesture that you may remember to use some day. Yes, it would\r\nfit well into that scene where you forgive your Don Juan de Lara.\r\nPerhaps I should tell you that I saw it made one day by my daughter. My\r\ndaughter is a very beautiful woman ... everyone thinks. Did ... did you\r\nknow my Do\xc3\xb1a Clara, Se\xc3\xb1ora?"\r\n\r\n"Her Grace often did me the honour of visiting my theatre. I knew the\r\nCondesa well by sight."\r\n\r\n"Do not remain so, on one knee, my child.--Pepita, tell Jenarito to\r\nbring this lady some sweet-cakes at once. Think, one day we fell out, I\r\nforget over what. Oh, there is nothing strange in that; all we mothers\r\nfrom time to time.... Look, can you come a little closer? You must not\r\nbelieve the town that says she was unkind to me. You are a great woman\r\nwith a beautiful nature and you can see further than the crowd sees in\r\nthese matters.--It is a pleasure to talk to you. What beautiful hair you\r\nhave! What beautiful hair!--She had not a warm impulsive nature, I know\r\nthat. But, oh, my child, she has such a store of intelligence and\r\ngraciousness. Any misunderstandings between us are so plainly my fault;\r\nis it not wonderful that she is so quick to forgive me? This day there\r\nfell one of those little moments. We both said hasty things and went off\r\nto our rooms. Then each turned back to be forgiven. Finally only a door\r\nseparated us and there we were pulling it in contrary ways. But at last\r\nshe ... took my ... face ... thus, in her two white hands. So! Look!"\r\n\r\nThe Marquesa almost fell out of her chair as she leaned forward, her\r\nface streaming with happy tears, and made the beatific gesture. I should\r\nsay the mythical gesture, for the incident was but a recurring dream.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you are here," she continued, "for now you have heard from my\r\nown lips that she is not unkind to me, as some people say. Listen,\r\nse\xc3\xb1ora, the fault was mine. Look at me. Look at me. There was some\r\nmistake that made me the mother of so beautiful a girl. I am difficult.\r\nI am trying. You and she are great women. No, do not stop me: you are\r\nrare women, and I am only a nervous ... a foolish ... a stupid woman.\r\nLet me kiss your feet. I am impossible. I am impossible. I am\r\nimpossible."\r\n\r\nHere indeed the old woman did fall out of her chair and was gathered up\r\nby Pepita and led back to her bed. The Perichole walked home in\r\nconsternation and sat for a long time gazing into her eyes in the\r\nmirror, her palms pressed against her cheeks.\r\n\r\nBut the person who saw most of the difficult hours of the Marquesa was\r\nher little companion, Pepita. Pepita was an orphan and had been brought\r\nup by that strange genius of Lima, the Abbess Madre Mar\xc3\xada del Pilar.\r\nThe only occasion upon which the two great women of Peru (as the\r\nperspective of history was to reveal them) met face to face was on the\r\nday when Do\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada called upon the directress of the Convent of Santa\r\nMar\xc3\xada Rosa de las Rosas and asked if she might borrow some bright girl\r\nfrom the orphanage to be her companion. The Abbess gazed hard at the\r\ngrotesque old woman. Even the wisest people in the world are not\r\nperfectly wise and Madre Mar\xc3\xada del Pilar who was able to divine the\r\npoor human heart behind all the masks of folly and defiance, had always\r\nrefused to concede one to the Marquesa de Montemayor. She asked her a\r\ngreat many questions and then paused to think. She wanted to give Pepita\r\nthe worldly experience of living in the palace. She also wanted to bend\r\nthe old woman to her own interests. And she was filled with a sombre\r\nindignation, for she knew she was gazing at one of the richest women in\r\nPeru, and the blindest.\r\n\r\nShe was one of those persons who have allowed their lives to be gnawed\r\naway because they have fallen in love with an idea several centuries\r\nbefore its appointed appearance in the history of civilization. She\r\nhurled herself against the obstinacy of her time in her desire to attach\r\na little dignity to women. At midnight when she had finished adding up\r\nthe accounts of the House she would fall into insane vision of an age\r\nwhen women could be organized to protect women, women travelling, women\r\nas servants, women when they are old or ill, the women she had\r\ndiscovered in the mines of Potosi, or in the workrooms of the\r\ncloth-merchants, the girls she had collected out of doorways on rainy\r\nnights. But always the next morning she had to face the fact that the\r\nwomen in Peru, even her nuns, went through life with two notions: one,\r\nthat all the misfortunes that might befall them were merely due to the\r\nfact that they were not sufficiently attractive to bind some man to\r\ntheir maintenance and, two, that all the misery in the world was worth\r\nhis caress. She had never known any country but the environs of Lima and\r\nshe assumed that all its corruption was the normal state of mankind.\r\nLooking back from our century we can see the whole folly of her hope.\r\nTwenty such women would have failed to make any impression on that age.\r\nYet she continued diligently in her task. She resembled the swallow in\r\nthe fable who once every thousand years transferred a grain of wheat, in\r\nthe hope of rearing a mountain to reach the moon. Such persons are\r\nraised up in every age; they obstinately insist on transporting their\r\ngrains of wheat and they derive a certain exhilaration from the sneers\r\nof the bystanders. "How queerly they dress!" we cry. "How queerly they\r\ndress!"\r\n\r\nHer plain red face had great kindliness, and more idealism than\r\nkindliness, and more generalship than idealism. All her work, her\r\nhospitals, her orphanage, her convent, her sudden journeys of rescue,\r\ndepended upon money. No one harbored a fairer admiration for mere\r\ngoodness, but she had been obliged to watch herself sacrificing her\r\nkindliness, almost her idealism, to generalship, so dreadful were the\r\nstruggles to obtain her subsidies from her superiors in the church. The\r\nArchbishop of Lima, whom we shall know later in a more graceful\r\nconnection, hated her with what he called a Vatinian hate and counted\r\nthe cessation of her visits among the compensations for dying.\r\n\r\nLately she had felt not only the breath of old age against her cheek,\r\nbut a graver warning. A chill of terror went through her, not for\r\nherself, but for her work. Who was there in Peru to value the things she\r\nhad valued? And rising one day at dawn she had made a rapid journey\r\nthrough her hospital and convent and orphanage, looking for a soul she\r\nmight train to be her successor. She hurried from empty face to empty\r\nface, occasionally pausing more from hope than conviction. In the\r\ncourtyard she came upon a company of girls at work over the linen and\r\nher eyes fell at once upon a girl of twelve who was directing the others\r\nat the trough and at the same time recounting to them with great\r\ndramatic fire the less probable miracles in the life of Saint Rose of\r\nLima. So it was that the search ended with Pepita. The education for\r\ngreatness is difficult enough at any time, but amid the sensibilities\r\nand jealousies of a convent it must be conducted with fantastic\r\nindirection. Pepita was assigned to the most disliked tasks in the\r\nHouse, but she came to understand all the aspects of its administration.\r\nShe accompanied the Abbess on her journeys, even though it was in the\r\ncapacity of custodian of the eggs and vegetables. And everywhere, by\r\nsurprise, hours would open up in which the Directress suddenly appeared\r\nand talked to her at great length, not only on religious experience, but\r\non how to manage women and how to plan contagious wards and how to beg\r\nfor money. It was a step in this education for greatness that led to\r\nPepita\'s arriving one day and entering upon the crazy duties of being\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada\'s companion. For the first two years she merely came for\r\noccasional afternoons, but finally she came to the palace to live. She\r\nnever had been taught to expect happiness, and the inconveniences, not\r\nto say terrors, of her new position did not seem to her excessive for a\r\ngirl of fourteen. She did not suspect that the Abbess, even there, was\r\nhovering above the house, herself estimating the stresses and watching\r\nfor the moment when a burden harms and not strengthens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nA few of Pepita\'s trials were physical: for example, the servants in the\r\nhouse took advantage of Do\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada\'s indisposition; they opened up the\r\nbedrooms of the palace to their relatives; they stole freely. Alone\r\nPepita stood out against them and suffered a persecution of small\r\ndiscomforts and practical jokes. Her mind, similarly, had its\r\ndistresses: when she accompanied Do\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada on her errands in the\r\ncity, the older woman would be seized with the desire to dash into a\r\nchurch, for what she had lost of religion as faith she had replaced with\r\nreligion as magic. "Stay here in the sunlight, my dear child; I shall\r\nnot be long," she would say. Do\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada would then forget herself in a\r\nreverie before the altar and leave the church by another door. Pepita\r\nhad been brought up by Madre Mar\xc3\xada del Pilar to an almost morbid\r\nobedience and when after many hours she ventured into the church and\r\nmade sure that her mistress was no longer there, still she returned to\r\nthe street-corner and waited while the shadows fell gradually across the\r\nsquare. Thus waiting in public she suffered all the torture of a little\r\ngirl\'s self-consciousness. She still wore the uniform of the orphanage\r\n(which a minute\'s thoughtfulness on the part of Do\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada could have\r\naltered) and she suffered hallucinations wherein men seemed to be\r\nstaring at her and whispering--nor were these always hallucinations. No\r\nless her heart suffered, for on some days Do\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada would suddenly\r\nbecome aware of her and would talk to her cordially and humorously,\r\nwould let appear for a few hours all the exquisite sensibility of the\r\nLetters; then, on the morrow she would withdraw into herself again and,\r\nwhile never harsh, would become impersonal and unseeing. The beginnings\r\nof hope and affection that Pepita had such need to expend would be\r\nwounded. She tiptoed about the palace, silent, bewildered, clinging only\r\nto her sense of duty and her loyalty to her "mother in the Lord," Madre\r\nMar\xc3\xada del Pilar, who had sent her there.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nFinally a new fact appeared that was to have considerable effect on the\r\nlives of both the Marquesa and her companion: "_My dear mother_," wrote\r\nthe Condesa, "_the weather has been most exhausting and the fact that\r\nthe orchards and gardens are in bloom only makes it the more trying. I\r\ncould endure flowers if only they had no perfume. I shall therefore ask\r\nyour permission to write you at less length than usual. If Vicente\r\nreturns before the post leaves he will be delighted to finish out the\r\nleaf and supply you with those tiresome details about myself which you\r\nseem to enjoy so. I shall not go to Grignan in Provence as I expected\r\nthis Fall, as child will be born in early October_."\r\n\r\nWhat child? The Marquesa leaned against the wall. Do\xc3\xb1a Clara had\r\nforeseen the exhausting importunities that this news would waken in her\r\nmother and had sought to mitigate them by the casualness of her\r\nannouncement. The ruse did not succeed. The famous Letter XLII was the\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nNow at length the Marquesa had something to be anxious about: her\r\ndaughter was to become a mother. This event, which merely bored Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nClara, discovered a whole new scale of emotions in the Marquesa. She\r\nbecame a mine of medical knowledge and suggestion. She combed the city\r\nfor wise old women and poured into her letters the whole folk-wisdom of\r\nthe New World. She fell into the most abominable superstition. She\r\npracticed a degrading system of taboos for her child\'s protection. She\r\nrefused to allow a knot in the house. The maids were forbidden to tie up\r\ntheir hair and she concealed upon her person ridiculous symbols of a\r\nhappy delivery. On the stairs the even steps were marked with red chalk\r\nand a maid who accidentally stepped upon an even step was driven from\r\nthe house with tears and screams. Do\xc3\xb1a Clara was in the hands of\r\nmalignant Nature who reserves the right to inflict upon her children the\r\nmost terrifying jests. There was an etiquette of propitiation which\r\ngenerations of peasant women had found comforting. So vast an army of\r\nwitnesses surely implied that there was some truth in it. At least it\r\ncould do no harm, and Perhaps it did good. But the Marquesa did not only\r\nsatisfy the rites of paganism; she studied the prescriptions of\r\nChristianity as well. She arose in the dark and stumbled through the\r\nstreets to the earliest Masses. She hysterically hugged the altar-rails\r\ntrying to rend from the gaudy statuettes a sign, only a sign, the ghost\r\nof a smile, the furtive nod of a waxen head. Would all be well? Sweet,\r\nsweet Mother, would all be well?\r\n\r\nAt times, after a day\'s frantic resort to such invocations, a revulsion\r\nwould sweep over her. Nature is deaf. God is indifferent. Nothing in\r\nman\'s power can alter the course of law. Then on some street-corner she\r\nwould stop, dizzy with despair, and leaning against a wall would long to\r\nbe taken from a world that had no plan in it. But soon a belief in the\r\ngreat Perhaps would surge up from the depths of her nature and she would\r\nfairly run home to renew the candles above her daughter\'s bed.\r\n\r\nAt last the time came to satisfy the supreme rite of Peruvian households\r\nlooking forward to this event: she made the pilgrimage to the shrine of\r\nSanta Mar\xc3\xada de Cluxambuqua. If there resided any efficacy in devotion\r\nat all, surely it lay in a visit to this great shrine. The ground had\r\nbeen holy through three religions; even before the Incan civilization\r\ndistraught human beings had hugged the rocks and lashed themselves with\r\nwhips to wring their will from the skies. Thither the Marquesa was\r\ncarried in her chair, crossing the bridge of San Luis Rey and ascending\r\nup into the hills toward that city of large-girdled women, a tranquil\r\ntown, slow-moving and slow-smiling; a city of crystal air, cold as the\r\nsprings that fed its many fountains; a city of bells, soft and musical,\r\nand tuned to carry on with one another the happiest quarrels. If\r\nanything turned out for disappointment in the town of Cluxambuqua the\r\ngrief was somehow assimilated by the overwhelming immanence of the Andes\r\nand by the weather of quiet joy that flowed in and about the\r\nside-streets. No sooner did the Marquesa see from a distance the white\r\nwalls of this town perched on the knees of the highest peaks than her\r\nfingers ceased turning the beads and the busy prayers of her fright were\r\ncut short on her lips.\r\n\r\nShe did not even alight at the inn, but leaving Pepita to arrange for\r\ntheir stay she went on to the church and knelt for a long time patting\r\nher hands softly together. She was listening to the new tide of\r\nresignation that was rising within her. Perhaps she would learn in time\r\nto permit both her daughter and her gods to govern their own affairs.\r\nShe was not annoyed by the whispering of the old women in padded\r\ngarments who sold candles and medals and talked about money from dawn to\r\ndark. She was not even distracted by an officious sacristan who tried to\r\ncollect a fee for something or other and who, from spite, made her\r\nchange her place under the pretext of repairing a tile on the floor.\r\nPresently she went out into the sunshine and sat on the steps of the\r\nfountain. She watched the little processions of invalids slowly\r\nrevolving about the gardens. She watched three hawks plunging about the\r\nsky. The children who had been playing by the fountain stared at her for\r\na moment, and went away alarmed, but a llama (a lady with a long neck\r\nand sweet shallow eyes, burdened down by a fur cape too heavy for her\r\nand picking her way delicately down an interminable staircase) came over\r\nand offered her a velvet cleft nose to stroke. The llama is deeply\r\ninterested in the men about her, is even fond of pretending that she too\r\nis one of them and of inserting her head into their conversations as\r\nthough in a moment she would lift her voice and contribute a wan and\r\nhelpful comment. Soon Do\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada was surrounded by a number of these\r\nsisters who seemed on the point of asking her why she clapped her hands\r\nso and how much her veiling cost a yard.\r\n\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada had arranged that any letters arriving from Spain should be\r\nbrought to her at once by a special messenger. She had travelled slowly\r\nfrom Lima and even now as she sat in the square a boy from her farm ran\r\nup and put into her hand a large packet wrapped in parchment and\r\ndangling some nuggets of sealing-wax. Slowly she undid the wrappings.\r\nWith measured stoic gestures she read first an affectionate and jocose\r\nnote from her son-in-law; then her daughter\'s letter. It was full of\r\nwounding remarks rather brilliantly said, perhaps said for the sheer\r\nvirtuosity of giving pain neatly. Each of its phrases found its way\r\nthrough the eyes of the Marquesa, then, carefully wrapped in\r\nunderstanding and forgiveness it sank into her heart. At last she arose,\r\ngently dispersed the sympathetic llamas, and with a grave face returned\r\nto the shrine.\r\n\r\nWhile Do\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada was passing the late afternoon in the Church and in\r\nthe Square, Pepita was left to prepare their lodging. She showed the\r\nporters where to lay down the great wicker hampers and set about\r\nunpacking the altar, the brazier, the tapestries and the portraits of\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Clara. She descended into the kitchen and gave the cook exact\r\ninstructions as to the preparations of a certain porridge upon which the\r\nMarquesa principally subsisted. Then she returned to the rooms and\r\nwaited. She resolved to write a letter to the Abbess. She hung for a\r\nlong time over the quill, staring into the distance with trembling lip.\r\nShe saw the face of Madre Mar\xc3\xada del Pilar, so red and scrubbed, and the\r\nwonderful black eyes. She heard her voice as at the close of supper (the\r\norphans sitting with lowered eyes and folded hands) she commented on the\r\nevents of the day, or as, by candlelight, she stood among the beds of the\r\nhospital and announced the theme for meditation during the night. But\r\nmost clearly of all Pepita remembered the sudden interviews when the\r\nAbbess (not daring to wait until the girl was older) had discussed with\r\nher the duties of her office. She had talked to Pepita as to an equal.\r\nSuch speech is troubling and wonderful to an intelligent child and Madre\r\nMar\xc3\xada del Pilar had abused it. She had expanded Pepita\'s vision of how\r\nshe should feel and act beyond the measure of her years. And she had\r\nunthinkingly turned upon Pepita the full blaze of her personality, as\r\nJupiter had turned his upon Semele. Pepita was frightened by her sense\r\nof insufficiency; she hid it and wept. And then the Abbess had cast the\r\nchild into the discipline of this long solitude, where Pepita struggled,\r\nrefusing to let herself believe that she had been abandoned. And now\r\nfrom this strange inn in these strange mountains, where the altitude was\r\nmaking her lightheaded, Pepita longed for the dear presence, the only\r\nreal thing in her life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nShe wrote a letter, all inkstains and incoherence. Then she went\r\ndownstairs to see about fresh charcoal and to taste the porridge.\r\n\r\nThe Marquesa came in and sat down at the table. "I can do no more. What\r\nwill be, will be," she whispered. She unbound from her neck the amulets\r\nof her superstition and dropped them into the glowing brazier. She had a\r\nstrange sense of having antagonized God by too much prayer and so\r\naddressed Him now obliquely. "After all it is in the hands of another. I\r\nno longer claim the least influence. What will be, will be." She sat for\r\na long time, her palms against her cheeks, making a blank of her mind.\r\nHer eyes fell on Pepita\'s letter. She opened it mechanically and started\r\nto read. She had read a full half of it before her attention was aware\r\nof the meaning of the words: "... _but all this is nothing if you like\r\nme and wish me to stay with her. I oughtn\'t to tell you but every now\r\nand then the bad chambermaids lock me up in rooms and steal things and\r\nperhaps My Lady will think that I steal them. I hope not. I hope you are\r\nwell and not having any trouble in the hospital or anywhere. Though I\r\nnever see you I think of you all the time and I remember what you told\r\nme, my dear mother in God. I want to do only what you want, but if you\r\ncould let me come back for a few days to the convent, but not if you do\r\nnot wish it. But I am so much alone and not talking to anyone, and\r\neverything. Sometimes I do not know whether you have forgotten me and if\r\nyou could find a minute to write me a little letter or something, I\r\ncould keep it, but I know how busy you are_...."\r\n\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada read no further. She folded the letter and put it aside.\r\nFor a moment she was filled with envy: she longed to command another\'s\r\nsoul as completely as this nun was able to do. Most of all she longed to\r\nbe back in this simplicity of love, to throw off the burden of pride and\r\nvanity that hers had always carried. To quiet the tumult in her mind she\r\npicked up a book of devotion and tried to fix her attention upon the\r\nwords. But after a moment she suddenly felt the need to reread the whole\r\nletter, to surprise, if possible, the secret of so much felicity.\r\n\r\nPepita returned bringing the supper in her hands, followed by a maid.\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada watched her over the top of her book as she would have\r\nwatched a visitor from Heaven. Pepita tiptoed about the room laying the\r\ntable and whispering directions to her assistant.\r\n\r\n"Your supper is ready, My Lady," she said at last.\r\n\r\n"But, my child, you are going to eat with me?" In Lima Pepita generally\r\nsat down at the table with her mistress.\r\n\r\n"I thought you would be tired, My Lady. I had my supper downstairs."\r\n\r\n"She does not wish to eat with me," thought the Marquesa. "She knows me\r\nand has rejected me."\r\n\r\n"Would you like me to read aloud to you while you are eating, My Lady?"\r\nasked Pepita, who felt that she had made a mistake.\r\n\r\n"No. You may go to bed, if you choose."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, My Lady."\r\n\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada had risen and approached the table. With one hand on the\r\nback of the chair she said haltingly: "My dear child, I am sending off a\r\nletter to Lima in the morning. If you have one you can enclose it with\r\nmine."\r\n\r\n"No, I have none," said Pepita. She added hastily: "I must go downstairs\r\nand get you the new charcoal."\r\n\r\n"But, my dear, you have one for ... Madre Mar\xc3\xada del Pilar. Wouldn\'t\r\nyou ...?"\r\n\r\nPepita pretended to be busy over the brazier. "No, I\'m not going to send\r\nit," she said. She was aware during the long pause that followed that\r\nthe Marquesa was staring at her in stupefaction. "I\'ve changed my mind."\r\n\r\n"I know she would like a letter from you, Pepita. It would make her very\r\nhappy. I know."\r\n\r\nPepita was reddening. She said loudly: "The innkeeper said that there\r\nwould be some new charcoal ready for you at dark. I\'ll tell them to\r\nbring it up now." She glanced hastily at the old woman and saw that she\r\nhad not ceased from staring at her with great sad inquiring eyes. Pepita\r\nfelt that these were not things one talked about, but the strange woman\r\nseemed to be feeling the matter so strongly that Pepita was willing to\r\nconcede one more answer: "No, it was a bad letter. It wasn\'t a good\r\nletter."\r\n\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada fairly gasped. "Why, my dear Pepita, I think it was very\r\nbeautiful. Believe me, I know. No, no; what could have made it a bad\r\nletter?"\r\n\r\nPepita frowned, hunting for a word that would close the matter.\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t ... it wasn\'t ... brave," she said. And then she would say no\r\nmore. She carried the letter off into her own room and could be heard\r\ntearing it up. Then she got into bed and lay staring into the darkness,\r\nstill uncomfortable at having talked in such a fashion. And Do\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada\r\nsat down to her dish amazed.\r\n\r\nShe had never brought courage to either life or love. Her eyes\r\nransacked her heart. She thought of the amulets and of her beads, her\r\ndrunkenness ... she thought of her daughter. She remembered the long\r\nrelationship, crowded with the wreckage of exhumed conversations, of\r\nfancied slights, of inopportune confidences, of charges of neglect and\r\nexclusion (but she must have been mad that day; she remembered beating upon\r\nthe table). "But it\'s not my fault," she cried. "It\'s not my fault that I\r\nwas so. It was circumstance. It was the way I was brought up. Tomorrow I\r\nbegin a new life. Wait and see, oh my child." At I last she cleared away\r\nthe table and sitting down wrote what she called her first letter, her\r\nfirst stumbling misspelled letter in courage. She remembered with shame\r\nthat in the previous one she had piteously asked her daughter how much she\r\nloved her, and had greedily quoted the few and hesitant endearments that\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Clara had lately ventured to her. Do\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada could not recall\r\nthose pages, but she could write some new ones, free and generous. No\r\none else has regarded them as stumbling. It is the famous letter LVI,\r\nknown to the Encyclopedists as her Second Corinthians because of its\r\nimmortal paragraph about love: "Of the thousands of persons we meet in a\r\nlifetime, my child ..." and so on. It was almost dawn when she finished\r\nthe letter. She opened the door upon her balcony and looked at the great\r\ntiers of stars that glittered above the Andes. Throughout the hours of\r\nthe night, though there had been few to hear it, the whole sky had been\r\nloud with the singing of these constellations. Then she took a candle\r\ninto the next room and looked at Pepita as she slept, and pushed back\r\nthe damp hair from the girl\'s face. "Let me live now," she whispered.\r\n"Let me begin again."\r\n\r\nTwo days later they started back to Lima, and while crossing the bridge\r\nof San Luis Rey the accident which we know befell them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART THREE: ESTEBAN\r\n\r\n\r\nONE morning twin boys were discovered in the foundlings\' basket before\r\nthe door of the Convent of Santa Mar\xc3\xada Rosa de las Rosas. Names were\r\nfound for them almost before the arrival of the wet-nurse, but the names\r\nwere not as useful to them as our names are to most of us, for no one\r\never succeeded in telling the boys apart. There was no way of knowing\r\nwho their parents were, but Limean gossips, noticing as the boys grew\r\nolder how straight they held themselves and how silent and sombre they\r\nwere, declared them to be Castilian and laid them in turn at all sorts\r\nof crested doorways. The person in the world who came nearest to being\r\ntheir guardian was the Abbess of the Convent. Madre Mar\xc3\xada del Pilar had\r\ncome to hate all men, but she grew fond of Manuel and Esteban. In the\r\nlate afternoon she would call them into her office, send for some cakes\r\nfrom the kitchen, and tell them stories about the Cid and Judas\r\nMaccabeus and the thirty-six misfortunes of Harlequin. She grew to love\r\nthem so, that she would catch herself gazing deep into their black and\r\nfrowning eyes, looking for those traits that would appear when they grew\r\nto be men, all that ugliness, all that soullessness that made hideous\r\nthe world she worked in. They grew up about the convent until they were\r\na little past the age when their presence began to be a slight\r\ndistraction to the dedicated sisters. From thence they became vaguely\r\nattached to all the sacristies in town: they trimmed all the cloister\r\nhedges; they polished every possible crucifix; they passed a damp cloth\r\nonce a year over most of the ecclesiastical ceilings. All Lima knew them\r\nwell. When the priest rushed through the streets carrying his precious\r\nburden into a sickroom either Esteban or Manuel was to be seen striding\r\nbehind him, swinging a censer. As they grew older, however, they showed\r\nno desire for the clerical life. They gradually assumed the profession\r\nof the scribe. There were few printing presses in the New World and the\r\nboys soon made a fair living transcribing comedies for the theatre,\r\nballads for the crowds, and advertisements for the merchants. Above all\r\nthey were the copyists of the choirmasters and made endless parts of the\r\nmotets of Morales and Vittoria.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBecause they had no family, because they were twins, and because they\r\nwere brought up by women, they were silent. There was in them a curious\r\nshame in regard to their resemblance. They had to live in a world where\r\nit was the subject of continual comment and joking. It was never funny\r\nto them and they suffered the eternal pleasantries with stolid patience.\r\nFrom the years when they first learned to speak they invented a secret\r\nlanguage for themselves, one that was scarcely dependent on the Spanish\r\nfor its vocabulary, or even for its syntax. They resorted to it only\r\nwhen they were alone, or at great intervals in moments of stress\r\nwhispered it in the presence of others. The Archbishop of Lima was\r\nsomething of a philologist; he dabbled in dialects; he had even evolved\r\nquite a brilliant table for the vowel and consonant changes from Latin\r\ninto Spanish and from Spanish into Indian-Spanish. He was storing up\r\nnotebooks of quaint lore against an amusing old age he planned to offer\r\nhimself back on his estates outside Segovia. So when he heard one day\r\nabout the secret language of the twin brothers, he trimmed some quills\r\nand sent for them. The boys stood humiliated upon the rich carpets of\r\nhis study while he tried to extract from them their _bread_ and _tree_\r\nand their _I see_ and _I saw_. They did not know why the experience was\r\nI so horrible to them. They bled. Long shocked silences followed each of\r\nthe Archbishop\'s questions, until finally one or the other mumbled an\r\nanswer. The priest thought for a while that they were merely in awe\r\nbefore his rank and before the luxury of his apartment, but at last,\r\nmuch perplexed, he divined the presence of some deeper reluctance and\r\nsadly let them go.\r\n\r\nThis language was the symbol of their profound identity with one\r\nanother, for just as resignation was a word insufficient to describe the\r\nspiritual change that came over the Marquesa de Montemayor on that night\r\nin the inn at Cluxambuqua, so _love_ is inadequate to describe the tacit\r\nalmost ashamed oneness of these brothers. What relationship is it in\r\nwhich few words are exchanged, and those only about the details of food,\r\nclothing and occupation; in which the two persons have a curious\r\nreluctance even to glance at one another; and in which there is a tacit\r\narrangement not to appear together in the city and to go on the same\r\nerrand by different streets? And yet side by side with this there\r\nexisted a need of one another so terrible that it produced miracles as\r\nnaturally as the charged air of a sultry day produces lightning. The\r\nbrothers were scarcely aware of it themselves, but telepathy was a\r\ncommon occurrence in their lives, and when one returned home the other\r\nwas always aware of it when his brother was still several streets away.\r\n\r\nSuddenly they discovered that they were tired of writing. They went down\r\nto the sea and found an occupation in loading and unloading vessels, not\r\nashamed of working side by side with Indians. They drove teams across\r\nthe provinces. They picked fruit. They were ferrymen. And always they\r\nwere silent. Their sombre faces took on from these labors a male and\r\ngypsy cast. Their hair was seldom cut and under the dark mat their eyes\r\nlooked up suddenly surprised and a little sullen. All the world was\r\nremote and strange and hostile except one\'s brother.\r\n\r\nBut at last the first shadow fell across this unity and the shadow was\r\ncast by the love of women. They had returned to the city and resumed the\r\ncopying of parts for the theatre. One night the manager, foreseeing a\r\nthinning house, gave them a free admission. The boys did not like what\r\nthey found there. Even speech was for them a debased form of silence;\r\nhow much more futile is poetry which is a debased form of speech. All\r\nthose allusions to honour, reputation, and the flame of love, all the\r\nmetaphors about birds, Achilles and the jewels of Ceylon were fatiguing.\r\nIn the presence of literature they had the same darkling intelligence\r\nthat stirs for a time behind the eyes of a dog, but they sat on\r\npatiently, gazing at the bright candles and the rich clothes. Between\r\nthe acts of the comedy the Perichole stepped out of her r\xc3\xb4le, put on\r\ntwelve petticoats and danced before the curtain. Esteban had some\r\ncopying still to do, or pretended so, and went home early; but Manuel\r\nstayed on. The red stockings and shoes of the Perichole had made their\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\nBoth brothers had fetched and carried their manuscripts up and down the\r\ndusty stairs behind the stage. There they had seen an irritable girl in\r\na soiled bodice mending her stockings before a mirror while her stage\r\ndirector read aloud her lines for memorization. She had let fall upon\r\nthe boys for a moment the detonation of her amazing eyes, immediately\r\ndissipated in her amused recognition that they were twins. Forthwith she\r\nhad dragged them into the room and placed them side by side. Carefully,\r\namusedly and remorselessly she had peered into every square inch of\r\ntheir faces, until finally laying one hand on Esteban\'s shoulder she had\r\ncried out: "This one is the younger!" That had been several years before\r\nand neither brother had thought of the episode again.\r\n\r\nHenceforth all Manuel\'s errands seemed to lead him past the theatre.\r\nLate at night he would drift about among the trees beneath her\r\ndressing-room window. It was not the first time that Manuel had been\r\nfascinated by a woman (both brothers had possessed women, and often,\r\nespecially during their years at the waterfront; but simply, latinly),\r\nbut it was the first time that his will and imagination had been thus\r\noverwhelmed. He had lost that privilege of simple nature, the\r\ndissociation of love and pleasure. Pleasure was no longer as simple as\r\neating; it was being complicated by love. Now was beginning that crazy\r\nloss of one\'s self, that neglect of everything but one\'s dramatic\r\nthoughts about the beloved, that feverish inner life all turning upon\r\nthe Perichole and which would so have astonished and disgusted her had\r\nshe been permitted to divine it. This Manuel had not fallen in love\r\nthrough any imitation of literature. It was not of him, at all events,\r\nthat the bitterest tongue in France had remarked only fifty years\r\nbefore: that many people would never have fallen in love if they had not\r\nheard about it. Manuel read little; he had only been once to the theatre\r\n(where above all there reigns the legend that love is a devotion) and\r\nthe Peruvian tavern-songs that he might have heard, unlike those of\r\nSpain, reflected very little of the romantic cult of an idealized woman.\r\nWhen he said over to himself that she was beautiful and rich and\r\nfatiguingly witty and the Viceroy\'s mistress, none of these attributes\r\nthat made her less obtainable had the power to quench his curious and\r\ntender excitement. So he leaned against the trees in the dark, his\r\nknuckles between his teeth, and listened to his loud heart-beats.\r\n\r\nBut the life that Esteban was leading had been full enough for him.\r\nThere was no room in his imagination for a new loyalty, not because his\r\nheart was less large than Manuel\'s, but because it was of a simpler\r\ntexture. Now he discovered that secret from which one never quite\r\nrecovers, that even in the most perfect love one person loves less\r\nprofoundly than the other. There may be two equally good, equally\r\ngifted, equally beautiful, but there may never be two that love one\r\nanother equally well. So Esteban sat up in their room by a guttering\r\ncandle, his knuckles between his teeth, and wondered why Manuel was so\r\nchanged and why the whole meaning had gone out of their life.\r\n\r\nOne evening Manuel was stopped on the street by a small boy who\r\nannounced to him that the Perichole wished him to call upon her at once.\r\nManuel turned in his path and went to the theatre. Straight, sombre and\r\nimpersonal, he entered the actress\'s room and stood waiting. Camila had\r\na service to ask of Manuel and she thought a few preliminary\r\nblandishments were necessary, but she scarcely paused in combing a blond\r\nwig that was dressed upon the table before her.\r\n\r\n"You write letters for people, don\'t you? I want you to write a letter\r\nfor me, please. Please come in."\r\n\r\nHe came forward two steps.\r\n\r\n"You never pay me the least visit either of you. That\'s not Spanish of\r\nyou."--meaning \'courteous.\'--"Which are you, Manuel or Esteban?"\r\n\r\n"Manuel."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t matter. You are both unfriendly. Neither of you ever comes\r\nto see me. Here I sit learning stupid lines all day and no one ever\r\ncomes to see me but a lot of peddlers. It is because I am an actress,\r\nno?"\r\n\r\nThis was not very artful, but for Manuel it was unspeakably complicated.\r\nHe merely stared at her from the shadows of his long hair and left her\r\nto improvise.\r\n\r\n"I am going to engage you to write a letter for me, a very secret\r\nletter. But now I can see that you don\'t like me and that to ask you to\r\nwrite a letter would be as good as reading it aloud in all the\r\nwine-shops. What does that look mean, Manuel? Are you my friend?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, se\xc3\xb1ora."\r\n\r\n"Go away. Send me Esteban. You do not even say _Yes, se\xc3\xb1ora_ as a\r\nfriend would say it."\r\n\r\nLong pause. Presently she raised her head: "Are you still there,\r\nUnfriendly?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, se\xc3\xb1ora ... you can trust me to do anything for you ... you can\r\ntrust ..."\r\n\r\n"If I ask you to write one letter for me, or two letters, you promise\r\nnever to mention to a human being what is in them, or even that you\r\nwrote them?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, se\xc3\xb1ora."\r\n\r\n"What do you promise by?--by the Virgin Mary?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, se\xc3\xb1ora."\r\n\r\n"And by the heart of Saint Rose of Lima?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, se\xc3\xb1ora."\r\n\r\n"Name of the Name, Manuel, anyone would think you were as stupid as an\r\nox. Manuel, I am very angry with you. You are not stupid. You don\'t look\r\nstupid. Please don\'t say just _Yes, se\xc3\xb1ora_ again. Don\'t be stupid or\r\nI\'ll send for Esteban. Is anything the matter with you?"\r\n\r\nHere Manuel cast himself upon the Spanish language and exclaimed with\r\nunnecessary vigor: "I swear by the Virgin Mary and the heart of St. Rose\r\nof Lima that all that has to do with the letter will be secret."\r\n\r\n"Even from Esteban," prompted the Perichole.\r\n\r\n"Even from Esteban."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s better." She motioned him to sit down at a table where\r\nwriting materials were already laid out. As she dictated she strode\r\nabout the room, frowning, swinging her hips. With her arms akimbo, she\r\nhugged her shawl about her shoulders defiantly.\r\n\r\n"_Camila Perichole kisses the hands of Your Excellency and says_--No,\r\ntake another piece of paper and begin again. _The se\xc3\xb1ora Micaela\r\nVillegas, artist, kisses the hands of Your Excellency and says that,\r\nbeing the victim of the envious and lying friends that Y. E.\'s goodness\r\npermits about Him, she can no longer endure Y. E.\'s suspicions and\r\njealousy. Y. E.\'s servant has always valued Y. E.\'s friendship and has\r\nnever committed, nor even thought, an offense against it, but she can no\r\nlonger fight against the calumnies that Y. E. believes so readily.\r\nSe\xc3\xb1ora Villegas, artist, called the Perichole, therefore returns\r\nherewith such of Y. E.\'s gifts as have not been placed beyond recall,\r\nsince without Y. E.\'s confidence, Y. E.\'s servant can take no pleasure\r\nin them_."\r\n\r\nCamila continued walking about the room for several minutes, consumed by\r\nher thoughts. Presently without so much as glancing at her secretary,\r\nshe commanded: "Take another leaf. _Have you gone mad? Do not ever think\r\nof eating another bull to me again. It has caused a frightful war.\r\nHeaven protect you, my colt. Friday night, the same place, the same\r\ntime. I may be a little late, for the fox is wide-awake_. That will be\r\nall."\r\n\r\nManuel rose.\r\n\r\n"You swear that you have made no errors?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I swear."\r\n\r\n"There is your money."\r\n\r\nManuel took the money.\r\n\r\n"I shall want you to write me more letters from time to time. My uncle\r\nPio generally writes my letters; these I do not wish him to know about.\r\nGood night. Go with God."\r\n\r\n"Go with God."\r\n\r\nManuel descended the stairs and stood for a long time among the trees,\r\nnot thinking, not moving.\r\n\r\nEsteban knew that his brother was continually brooding over the\r\nPerichole, but he never suspected that he saw her. From time to time\r\nduring the next two months a small boy would approach him in great haste\r\nand ask whether he were Manuel or Esteban, and being informed that he\r\nwas only Esteban, the boy would add that Manuel was wanted at the\r\ntheatre. Esteban assumed that the call was for copyist\'s work and was\r\ntherefore utterly unprepared for a visit that they received one night in\r\ntheir room.\r\n\r\nIt was almost midnight. Esteban had gone to bed, and lay gazing out from\r\nunder the blanket at the candle beside which his brother was working.\r\nThere was a light tap at the door and Manuel opened to admit a lady\r\nheavily veiled, out of breath and nervous. She threw back the scarf from\r\nher face and said hurriedly:\r\n\r\n"Quick, ink and paper. You are Manuel, yes? You must do a letter for me\r\nat once."\r\n\r\nFor a moment her glance fell on the two bright eyes that glared at her\r\nfrom the edge of the cot. She murmured: "Eu ... you must excuse me. I\r\nknow it is late. It was necessary ... I must come." Then turning to\r\nManuel, she whispered into his ear: "Write this: _I Perichole, am not\r\naccustomed to wait at a rendez-vous_. Have you finished that? _You are\r\nonly a cholo, and there are better matadors than you, even in Lima. I am\r\nhalf Castilian and there are no better actresses in the world. You shall\r\nnot have the opportunity_--Have you got that?--_to keep me waiting\r\nagain, cholo, and I shall laugh the last, for even an actress does not\r\ngrow old as fast as a bullfighter_."\r\n\r\nTo Esteban in the shadows the picture of Camila leaning over his\r\nbrother\'s hand and whispering into his ear was complete evidence that a\r\nnew congeniality had formed such as he would never know. He seemed to\r\nshrink away into space, infinitely tiny, infinitely unwanted. He took\r\none more glance at the tableau of love, all the paradise from which he\r\nwas shut out, and turned his face to the wall.\r\n\r\nCamila seized the note the moment it was done, pushed a coin along the\r\ntable and in a last flurry of black lace, scarlet beads and excited\r\nwhispers left the room. Manuel turned from the door with his candle. He\r\nsat down, put his hand over his ears, his elbows on his knees. He\r\nworshipped her. He murmured to himself over and over again that he\r\nworshipped her, making of the sound a sort of incantation and an\r\nobstacle to thought.\r\n\r\nHe emptied his mind of everything but a singsong, and it was this\r\nvacancy that permitted him to become aware of Esteban\'s mood. He seemed\r\nto hear a voice that proceeded from the shadows saying: "Go and follow\r\nher, Manuel. Don\'t stay here. You\'ll be happy. There\'s room for us all\r\nin the world." Then the realization became even more intense and he\r\nreceived a mental image of Esteban going a long way off and saying\r\ngood-bye many times as he went. He was filled with terror; by the light\r\nof it he saw that all the other attachments in the world were shadows,\r\nor the illusions of fever, even Madre Mar\xc3\xada del Pilar, even the\r\nPerichole. He could not understand why Esteban\'s misery should present\r\nitself as demanding a choice between him and the Perichole, but he could\r\nunderstand Esteban\'s misery, as misery. And at once he sacrificed\r\neverything to it, if it can be said we ever sacrifice anything save what\r\nwe know we can never attain, or what some secret wisdom tells us it\r\nwould be uncomfortable or saddening to possess. To be sure there was\r\nnothing on which Esteban could base a complaint. It was not jealousy,\r\nfor in their earlier affairs it had never occurred to either of them\r\nthat their loyalty to one another had been diminished. It was merely\r\nthat in the heart of one of them there was left room for an elaborate\r\nimaginative attachment and in the heart of the other there was not.\r\nManuel could not quite understand this and, as we shall see, he\r\nnourished a dim sense of being accused unjustly. But he did understand\r\nthat Esteban was suffering. In his excitement he groped for a means of\r\nholding this brother who seemed to be receding into the distance. And at\r\nonce, in one unhesitating stroke of the will, he removed the Perichole\r\nfrom his heart.\r\n\r\nHe blew out the candle and lay down on his bed. He was trembling. He\r\nsaid aloud with exaggerated casualness: "Well, that\'s the last letter I\r\nwrite for that woman. She can go and find a pander somewhere else. If\r\never she calls here or sends for me when I\'m out, tell her so. Make it\r\nplain. That\'s the last I have to do with her," and with that he began\r\nreciting his evening psalm aloud. But he had hardly reached _A sagitta\r\nvolante in die_ when he became aware that Esteban had risen and was\r\nlighting the candle.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going out for a walk," replied Esteban sombrely, fastening his\r\nbelt. After a moment, he broke out with an assumption of anger: "You\r\ndon\'t have to say ... what you just said, for me. I don\'t care whether\r\nyou write her letters or not. You don\'t have to change for me. I haven\'t\r\nanything to do with that."\r\n\r\n"Go to bed, you fool. God, you\'re a fool, Esteban. What made you think I\r\nsaid that, for you? Don\'t you believe I mean it when I say I\'m through\r\nwith her? Do you think I want to write any more of her dirty letters and\r\nget paid for them like that?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right. You love her. You don\'t have to change because of me."\r\n\r\n"\'_Love_ her?\' _Love_ her? You\'re crazy, Esteban. How could I love\r\nher? What chance would there be for me? Do you suppose she\'d give me\r\nthose letters to write if there were any chance? Do you suppose she\'d\r\npush a piece of money across the table every time.... You\'re crazy,\r\nEsteban, that\'s all."\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause. Esteban would not go to bed. He sat by the\r\ncandle in the middle of the room, tapping with his hand on the edge of\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n"Go to bed, you fool," shouted Manuel, rising on one elbow under the\r\nblanket. He was talking in their secret language and the new pain at his\r\nheart, gave a greater ring of reality to his assumption of rage. "I\'m\r\nall right."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t. I\'m going out for a walk," replied Esteban picking up his\r\ncoat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"You can\'t go out for a walk. It\'s two o\'clock. It\'s raining. You can\'t\r\ngo and walk about for hours like that. Look, Esteban, I swear to you\r\nthere\'s nothing left to all that. I don\'t love her. I only did for a\r\ntime."\r\n\r\nBy now Esteban stood in the dark of the open door. In the unnatural\r\nvoice with which we make the greatest declarations of our lives, he\r\nmuttered: "I\'m in your way," and turned to go.\r\n\r\nManuel leapt out of his bed. His head seemed to be full of a great din,\r\na voice crying out that Esteban was going away forever, was leaving him\r\nalone forever. "In the name of God, in the name of God, Esteban, come\r\nback here."\r\n\r\nEsteban came back and went to bed and the matter was not mentioned again\r\nfor many weeks. The very next evening Manuel had an opportunity of\r\ndeclaring his position. A messenger arrived from the Perichole and was\r\ntold harshly to inform the actress that Manuel would write no more\r\nletters for her.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne evening Manuel tore open the flesh on his knee against a piece of\r\nmetal.\r\n\r\nNeither brother had ever been ill for as much as a day in his life, and\r\nnow Manuel, utterly bewildered, watched his leg swell and felt the waves\r\nof pain rise and fall in his body. Esteban sat by and stared at his face\r\ntrying to imagine what great pain was. At last one midnight Manuel\r\nremembered that the signboard of a certain hairdresser in the city\r\ndescribed the proprietor as an experienced barber and surgeon. Esteban\r\nran through the streets to fetch him. He pounded on the door. Presently\r\na woman leaned out of a window and announced that her husband would be\r\nback in the morning. During the fearful hours that followed, they told\r\none another that when the doctor had seen the leg all would be well. He\r\nwould do something about it, and Manuel would be out around the town in\r\na day or two, even in a day perhaps, even less than a day.\r\n\r\nThe barber arrived and prescribed various draughts and ointments.\r\nEsteban was instructed to lay cold cloths on his brother\'s leg every\r\nhour. The barber withdrew and the brothers sat down to wait for the pain\r\nto subside. But while they continued staring into one another\'s face\r\nwaiting for the miracle of science the pain grew worse. Hour after hour\r\nEsteban approached with his dripping towel and they discovered that the\r\nmoment of its application was the worst of all. With all the fortitude\r\nin the world Manuel could not prevent himself from shouting and from\r\nflinging himself about upon the bed. Night came on and still Esteban\r\nstolidly waited and watched and worked. Nine, ten, eleven. Now when the\r\ntime drew near to apply the cloths (the hour struck so musically from\r\nall those towers) Manuel would plead with Esteban not to do his work. He\r\nwould resort to guile and declare that he scarcely felt it. But Esteban,\r\nhis heart bursting with pain and his lips a line of iron, would roll\r\nback the blanket and bind the towel fiercely in its place. Manuel\r\ngradually became delirious and under this application all the thoughts\r\nhe did not permit himself in his right mind would burst magnified from\r\nhis mouth.\r\n\r\nFinally at two o\'clock, out of his mind with rage and pain, and flinging\r\nhimself half out of the bed until his head struck the floor, Manuel\r\ncried: "God condemn your soul to the hottest hell there is. A thousand\r\ndevils torture you forever, Esteban. God condemn your soul, do you\r\nhear?" At first, the air gone out of his body, Esteban went out into the\r\nhall and leaned against the door, his mouth and eyes wide open. Still he\r\nheard from within: "Yes, Esteban, may God damn your beastly soul\r\nforever, do you hear that? For coming between me and what was mine by\r\nright. She was mine, do you hear, and what right had you...." and he\r\nwould go off into an elaborate description of the Perichole.\r\n\r\nThese outbursts recurred hourly. It was some time before Esteban was\r\nable to realize that his brother\'s mind was not then clear. After some\r\nmoments of horror, in which his being a devout believer had its part, he\r\nwould return to the room and go about his duties with bent head.\r\n\r\nTowards dawn his brother became serener. (For what human ill does not\r\ndawn seem to be an alleviation?) It was in one of these intervals that\r\nManuel said quite calmly:\r\n\r\n"God\'s son! I feel better, Esteban. Those cloths must be good after all.\r\nYou\'ll see. I\'ll be up and around tomorrow. You haven\'t slept for days.\r\nYou\'ll see I won\'t cause you any more trouble, Esteban."\r\n\r\n"It\'s no trouble, you fool."\r\n\r\n"You mustn\'t take me seriously when I try and stop you putting on the\r\nold cloths, Esteban."\r\n\r\nA long pause. At last Esteban brought out, barely audible:\r\n\r\n"I think ... don\'t you think it would be fine if I sent for the\r\nPerichole? She could just come and see you for a few minutes, I\r\nmean...."\r\n\r\n"Her? You still thinking about her? I wouldn\'t have her here for\r\nanything. No."\r\n\r\nBut Esteban was not content yet. He dragged up a few more phrases from\r\nthe very centre of his being:\r\n\r\n"Manuel, you still feel, don\'t you, that I came between you and the\r\nPerichole and you don\'t remember that I told you it was all right with\r\nme. I swear to you I\'d have been glad if you\'d gone away with her, or\r\nanything."\r\n\r\n"What are you bringing that up for, Esteban? I tell you, in God\'s own\r\nname, I never think of that. She\'s nothing to me. When are you going to\r\nforget that, Esteban? I tell you I\'m glad things are as they are. Look,\r\nI got to get angry when you keep going back to that."\r\n\r\n"Manuel, I wouldn\'t speak of it again, only when you get angry at me\r\nabout the cloths ... you, you get angry at me about that, too. And you\r\ntalk about it and you ..."\r\n\r\n"Look, I\'m not responsible what I say. My old leg hurts then, see."\r\n\r\n"Then you don\'t damn me to hell because ... it looks like I came between\r\nyou and the Perichole?"\r\n\r\n"Damn you to ...? What makes you say that? You\'re going crazy, Esteban;\r\nyou\'re imagining things. You haven\'t had any sleep, Esteban. I been a\r\ncurse to you and you\'re losing your health because of me. But you\'ll\r\nsee, I won\'t trouble you much more. How could I damn you to hell,\r\nEsteban, when you\'re all I\'ve got? Understand, see, that when the cold\r\ncloths go on, I just lose myself, see. You know. Don\'t think about it\r\ntwice. It\'s time to put them on now. I won\'t say a word."\r\n\r\n"No, Manuel, I\'ll skip this time. It won\'t do you any harm, I\'ll just\r\nskip this time."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got to get well, Esteban. I\'ve got to get up soon, you know. Put\r\nthem on. But one minute--give me the crucifix. I swear by the blood and\r\nbody of Christ that if I say anything against Esteban, I don\'t mean it\r\nand it\'s just the foolish words when I\'m dreaming because of the pain in\r\nmy leg. God make me well again soon, amen. Put it back. There. Now I\'m\r\nready."\r\n\r\n"Look, Manuel, it won\'t hurt if I skip just this once, see. It\'ll be\r\ngood for you, sure, to not get it all stirred up just this once."\r\n\r\n"No, I\'ve got to get well. The doctor said it had to be done. I won\'t\r\nsay a word, Esteban."\r\n\r\nAnd it would begin all over again.\r\n\r\nDuring the second night a prostitute in the next room started beating on\r\nthe wall, outraged at such language. A priest in the room on the other\r\nside would come out into the hall and beat on the door. The whole floor\r\nwould gather before the room in exasperation. The innkeeper came up the\r\nstairs, loudly promising his guests that the brothers would be dumped\r\ninto the street the very next morning. Esteban, holding his candle,\r\nwould go into the hall and permit them to rage at him for as long as\r\nthey pleased; but after that he took to pressing his hand firmly over\r\nhis brother\'s mouth during the moments of greatest stress. This\r\nincreased Manuel\'s personal rage at him and he would babble all through\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nOn the third night, Esteban sent for the priest and amidst the enormous\r\nshadows Manuel received the sacrament, and died.\r\n\r\nThereafter Esteban refused to come near the building. He would start off\r\nupon long walks, but presently drifting back, would hang about, staring\r\nat passers-by, within two streets of where his brother lay. The\r\ninnkeeper failing to make any impression upon him and remembering that\r\nthe boys were brought up at the Convent of Santa Mar\xc3\xada Rosa de las\r\nRosas, sent for the Abbess. Simply and soundly she directed all that was\r\nto be done. At last she went down to the street corner and spoke to\r\nEsteban. He watched her approach him, a glance mixed of longing and\r\ndistrust. But when she stood near him he turned sideways and looked\r\naway.\r\n\r\n"I want you to help me. Won\'t you come in and see your brother? Won\'t\r\nyou come in and help me?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t help me!" A long pause. Suddenly as she stood there full of\r\nher helplessness there flashed through her mind an incident of many\r\nyears before: the twin brothers about fifteen years old were sitting at\r\nher knee and she was telling them the story of the crucifixion. Their\r\nlarge grave eyes were fixed upon her lips. Suddenly Manuel had cried out\r\nloudly: "If Esteban and I had been there we would have prevented it."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, if you won\'t help me, will you tell me which you are?"\r\n\r\n"Manuel," said Esteban.\r\n\r\n"Manuel, won\'t you come and sit with me up there for just a short time?"\r\n\r\nAfter a long pause: "No."\r\n\r\n"But Manuel, dear Manuel, can\'t you remember as children how you did so\r\nmany things for me? You were willing to go across the town on some\r\nlittle errand. When I was ill you made the cook let you bring me my\r\nsoup?" Another woman would have said: "Do you remember how much I did\r\nfor you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"I, too, Manuel have lost. I too ... once. We know that God has taken\r\nthem into His hands...." But this did not do at all. Esteban turned\r\nvaguely and walked away from her. When he had gone about twenty paces he\r\nstopped and stared down a side-street, like a dog who wants to go away,\r\nbut is reluctant to offend the master who calls him back.\r\n\r\nThat was all they could get out of him. When the fearful procession\r\npassed through the city, with its black hoods and masks, its candles in\r\nbroad daylight, its display of heaped-up skulls, its terrifying psalms,\r\nEsteban followed it in the parallel streets, catching glimpses of it\r\nfrom a distance, like a savage.\r\n\r\nAll Lima was interested in this separation of the brothers. Housewives\r\nwhispered together sympathetically about it as they unfurled their\r\ncarpets from the balconies. The men in the wineshops, alluding to it,\r\nshook their heads and smoked in silence for a while. Travellers from the\r\ninterior told of seeing Esteban as he strayed with eyes like coals along\r\nthe dried-up beds of rivers or through the great ruins of the old race.\r\nA herder of llamas had come upon him standing upon a hilltop, asleep or\r\ndazed, wet with dew under the stars. Some fishermen surprised him\r\nswimming far out from shore. From time to time he would find work to do,\r\nhe would become a shepherd or a carter, but after a few months he would\r\ndisappear and stride from province to province. But he always returned\r\nto Lima. One day he appeared at the door of the Perichole\'s\r\ndressing-room; he made as though to speak, gazed earnestly at her and\r\nvanished. One day a sister came running into the office of Madre Mar\xc3\xada\r\ndel Pilar with the news that Esteban (whom the world called Manuel) was\r\nlingering about the door of the convent. The Abbess hurried out into the\r\nstreet. For months she had been asking herself what strategy could\r\nreconcile this half-demented boy to living among them again. She\r\nassembled as grave and calm a manner as she was able and appearing at\r\nthe street door murmured "My friend" and looked at him. He gazed back at\r\nher with the same glance of longing and distrust that he had shown her\r\nbefore, and stood trembling. Again she whispered "My friend" and moved a\r\nstep forward. Suddenly Esteban turned and breaking into a run\r\ndisappeared. Madre Mar\xc3\xada del Pilar rushed stumbling back to her desk\r\nand fell upon her knees, exclaiming angrily: "I have prayed for wisdom\r\nand You have given me none. You have not chosen to give me the least\r\ngrace. I am a mere scrubber of floors...." But during the penance she\r\nset herself for this impudence the thought came to her to send for\r\nCaptain Alvarado. Three weeks later she had a ten-minute conversation\r\nwith him. And the next day he started for Cuzco where, it was said,\r\nEsteban was doing some copying for the University.\r\n\r\nThere was this strange and noble figure in Peru during these years, the\r\nCaptain Alvarado, the traveller. He was blackened and cured by all\r\nweathers. He stood in the Square with feet apart as though they were\r\nplanted on a shifting deck. His eyes were strange, unaccustomed to the\r\nshorter range, too used to seizing the appearances of a constellation\r\nbetween a cloud and a cloud, and the outline of a cape in rain. His\r\nreticence was sufficiently explained for most of us by his voyages, but\r\nthe Marquesa de Montemayor had other light on the matter. "_Captain\r\nAlvarado is bringing you this letter in person_," she wrote to her\r\ndaughter. "_Introduce him to some of your geographers, my treasure,\r\nthough it may make them a little uncomfortable, for he is the diamond of\r\nsincerity. They will never see anyone who has travelled so far. Last\r\nnight he described to me some of his voyages. Imagine him pushing his\r\nprow through a sea of weeds, stirring up a cloud of fish like\r\ngrasshoppers in June; or sailing between islands of ice. Oh, he has been\r\nto China and up the rivers of Africa. But he is not merely an adventurer\r\nand he seems to take no pride in discovering new places; nor is he a\r\nmere merchant. One day I asked him narrowly why he lived so, and he\r\navoided my question. I found out from my laundress what I think is the\r\nreason of his wandering: My child, he had a child; my daughter, he had a\r\ndaughter. She was just old enough to cook a holiday meal, and do a\r\nlittle sewing for him. In those days he merely sailed between Mexico and\r\nPeru and hundreds of times she waved him farewell or welcome. We have no\r\nway of knowing whether she was more beautiful or intelligent than the\r\nthousands of other girls that lived about him, but she was his. I\r\nsuppose it seems ignoble to you that a great oak of a man should go\r\nabout the world like a blind man about an empty house merely because a\r\nchit of a girl has been withdrawn from it. No, no, you cannot understand\r\nthis, my adored one, but I understand and grow pale. Last night he sat\r\nwith me and talked of her. He laid his cheek against his hand and\r\nlooking into the fire, he said: \'It sometimes seems to me that she is\r\naway upon a voyage and that I shall see her again. It seems to me that\r\nshe is in England.\' You will laugh at me, but I think he goes about the\r\nhemispheres to pass the time between now and his old age_."\r\n\r\nThe brothers had always entertained a great respect for Captain\r\nAlvarado. They had worked for him a short time and the silence of the\r\nthree of them had made a little kernel of sense in a world of boasting,\r\nself-excuse and rhetoric. So now when the great traveller came into the\r\ndark kitchen where Esteban was eating the boy drew his chair farther\r\ninto the shadow, but at a distance, he was glad. The Captain gave no\r\nsign of recognizing or even of seeing him until he had finished his\r\nmeal. Esteban had finished long before, but not wishing to be spoken to,\r\nwaited until the Captain should have left the cave. At last the Captain\r\nwalked over to him and said:\r\n\r\n"You are Esteban or Manuel. You helped me once with some unloading. I am\r\nCaptain Alvarado."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Esteban.\r\n\r\n"How are you?"\r\n\r\nEsteban muttered something.\r\n\r\n"I am looking for some strong fellows to go on my next trip with me."\r\nPause. "Would you like to come?" Longer pause. "England. And Russia....\r\nHard work. Good wages.... A long way from Peru.--Well?"\r\n\r\nApparently Esteban had not been listening. He sat with his eyes on the\r\ntable. At last the Captain raised his voice, as to a deaf person:\r\n\r\n"I said: Do you want to go on my next trip with me...."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ll go," answered Esteban suddenly.\r\n\r\n"Fine. That\'s fine. I want your brother, too, of course."\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter? Wouldn\'t he want to come?"\r\n\r\nEsteban mumbled something, looking away. Then half rising, he said: "I\r\ngot to go now. I\'ve got to see somebody about something."\r\n\r\n"Let me see your brother myself. Where is he?"\r\n\r\n"... \'dead," said Esteban.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I didn\'t know. I didn\'t know. I\'m sorry." "Yes," said Esteban. "I\r\ngot to go."\r\n\r\n"Hmm.--Which are you? What\'s your name?"\r\n\r\n"Esteban."\r\n\r\n"When did Manuel die?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, just a ... just a few weeks. He hit his knee against something\r\nand ... just a few weeks ago."\r\n\r\nThey both kept their eyes on the floor.\r\n\r\n"How old are you, Esteban?"\r\n\r\n"Twenty-two."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s settled then, you\'re coming with me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"You may not be used to the cold."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m used to it.--I\'ve got to go now. I got to go in the city and\r\nsee somebody about something."\r\n\r\n"Well, Esteban. Come back here for supper and we\'ll talk about the trip.\r\nCome back and have some wine with me, see. Will you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I will."\r\n\r\n"Go with God."\r\n\r\n"Go with God."\r\n\r\nThey had supper together and it was arranged that they were to start for\r\nLima the next morning. The Captain got him very drunk. At first they\r\npoured and drank and poured and drank in silence. Then the Captain began\r\nto talk about ships and their courses. He asked Esteban questions about\r\ntackle and about the guide-stars. Then Esteban began to talk about other\r\nthings, and to talk very loudly:\r\n\r\n"On the ship you must give me something to do all the time. I\'ll do\r\nanything, anything. I\'ll climb up high and fix ropes; and I\'ll watch all\r\nnight,--because, you know, I don\'t sleep well anyway. And, Captain\r\nAlvarado, on the ship you must pretend that you don\'t know me. Pretend\r\nthat you hate me the most. So that you\'ll always give me things to do. I\r\ncan\'t sit still and write at a table any more.--And don\'t tell the other\r\nmen about me ... that is, about ..."\r\n\r\n"I hear you went into a burning house, Esteban, and pulled someone out."\r\n\r\n"Yes. I didn\'t get burned or anything. You know," cried Esteban, leaning\r\nacross the table, "you\'re not allowed to kill yourself; you know you\'re\r\nnot allowed. Everybody knows that. But if you jump into a burning house\r\nto save somebody, that wouldn\'t be killing yourself. And if you became\r\na matador and the bull caught you that wouldn\'t be killing yourself.\r\nOnly you mustn\'t put yourself in the bull\'s way on purpose. Did you ever\r\nnotice that animals never kill themselves, even when they\'re sure to\r\nlose? They never jump into a river or anything, even when they\'re sure\r\nto lose. Some people say that horses run into bonfires. Is that true?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t think that\'s true."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it\'s true. We had a dog once. Well, I mustn\'t think of\r\nthat.--Captain Alvarado, do you know Madre Mar\xc3\xada del Pilar?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"I want to give her a present before I go away. Captain Alvarado, I want\r\nyou to give me all my wages before I start--I won\'t need any money\r\nanywhere--and I want to buy her a present now. The present isn\'t from me\r\nonly. She was ... was ..." Here Esteban wished to say his brother\'s\r\nname, but was unable to. Instead he continued in a lower voice: "She had\r\na kind of a ... she had a serious loss, once. She said so. I don\'t know\r\nwho it was, and I want to give her a present. Women can\'t bear that kind\r\nof a thing like we can."\r\n\r\nThe Captain promised him that they would choose something in the\r\nmorning. Esteban talked about it at great length. At last the Captain\r\nsaw him slip under the table, and himself, rising up, went out into the\r\nsquare before the inn. He looked at the line of the Andes and at the\r\nstreams of stars crowding forever across the sky. And there was that\r\nwraith hanging in mid-air and smiling at him, the wraith with the\r\nsilvery voice that said for the thousandth time: "Don\'t be gone long.\r\nBut I\'ll be a big girl when you get back." Then he went within and\r\ncarried Esteban to his room and sat looking at him for a long while.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he was waiting at the bottom of the stairs when\r\nEsteban appeared:\r\n\r\n"We\'re starting when you\'re ready," said the Captain.\r\n\r\nThe strange glitter had returned to the boy\'s eyes. He blurted out: "No,\r\nI\'m not coming. I\'m not coming after all."\r\n\r\n"A\xc3\xafe! Esteban! But you have promised me that you would come."\r\n\r\n"It\'s impossible. I can\'t come with you," and he turned back up the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\n"Come here a moment, Esteban, just a moment."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t come with you. I can\'t leave Peru."\r\n\r\n"I want to tell you something."\r\n\r\nEsteban came down to the foot of the stairs.\r\n\r\n"How about that present for Madre Mar\xc3\xada del Pilar?" asked the Captain\r\nin a low voice. Esteban was silent, looking over the mountains. "You\r\naren\'t going to take that present away from her? It might mean a lot to\r\nher ... you know."\r\n\r\n"All right," murmured Esteban, as though much impressed.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Besides the ocean\'s better than Peru. You know Lima and Cuzco and\r\nthe road. You have nothing more to know about them. You see it\'s the\r\nocean you want. Besides on the boat you\'ll have something to do every\r\nminute. I\'ll see to that. Go and get your things and we\'ll start."\r\n\r\nEsteban was trying to make a decision. It had always been Manuel who had\r\nmade the decisions and even Manuel had never been forced to make as\r\ngreat a one as this. Esteban went slowly upstairs. The Captain waited\r\nfor him and waited so long that presently he ventured half the way up\r\nthe stairs and listened. At first there was silence; then a series of\r\nnoises that his imagination was able to identify at once. Esteban had\r\nscraped away the plaster about a beam and was adjusting a rope about it.\r\nThe Captain stood on the stairs trembling: "Perhaps it\'s best," he said\r\nto himself. "Perhaps I should leave him alone. Perhaps it\'s the only\r\nthing possible for him." Then on hearing another sound he flung himself\r\nagainst the door, fell into the room and caught the boy. "Go away,"\r\ncried Esteban. "Let me be. Don\'t come in now."\r\n\r\nEsteban fell face downward upon the floor. "I am alone, alone, alone" he\r\ncried. The Captain stood above him, his great plain face ridged gray\r\nwith pain; it was his own old hours he was reliving. He was the\r\nawkwardest speaker in the world apart from the lore of the sea, but\r\nthere are times when it requires a high courage to speak the banal. He\r\ncould not be sure the figure on the floor was listening, but he said "We\r\ndo what we can. We push on, Esteban, as best we can. It isn\'t for long,\r\nyou know. Time keeps going by. You\'ll be surprised at the way time\r\npasses."\r\n\r\nThey started for Lima. When they reached the bridge of San Luis Rey, the\r\nCaptain descended to the stream below in order to supervise the passage\r\nof some merchandise, but Esteban crossed by the bridge and fell with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FOUR: UNCLE PIO\r\n\r\n\r\nIN one of her letters (the XXIXth) the Marquesa de Montemayor tries to\r\ndescribe the impression that Uncle Pio "_our aged Harlequin_" made upon\r\nher: "_I have been sitting all morning on the green balcony making you a\r\npair of slippers, my soul_," she tells her daughter. "_As the golden\r\nwire did not take up my whole attention I was able to follow the\r\nactivity of a coterie of ants in the wall beside me. Somewhere behind\r\nthe partition they were patiently destroying my house. Every three\r\nminutes a little workman would appear between two boards and drop a\r\ngrain of wood upon the floor below. Then he would wave his antennae at\r\nme and back busily into his mysterious corridor. In the meantime various\r\nbrothers and sisters of his were trotting back and forth on a certain\r\nhighway, stopping to massage one another\'s heads, or if the messages\r\nthey bore were of first importance, refusing angrily to massage or to be\r\nmassaged. And at once I thought of Uncle Pio. Why? Where else but with\r\nhim had I seen that very gesture with which he arrests a passing abb\xc3\xa9\r\nor a courtier\'s valet, and whispers, his lips laid against his victim\'s\r\near? And surely enough, before noon I saw him hurry by on one of those\r\nmysterious errands of his. As I am the idlest and silliest of women I\r\nsent Pepita to get me a piece of nougat which I placed on the ant\'s\r\nhighway. Similarly I sent word to the Caf\xc3\xa9 Pizarro asking them to send\r\nUncle Pio to see me if he dropped in before sunset. I shall give him\r\nthat old bent salad fork with the turquoise in it, and he will bring me\r\na copy of the new ballad that everyone is singing about the d--q--a of\r\nOl--v--s. My child, you shall have the best of everything, and you shall\r\nhave it first_."\r\n\r\nAnd in the next letter: "_My dear, Uncle Pio is the most delightful man\r\nin the world, your husband excepted. He is the second most delightful\r\nman in the world. His conversation is enchanting. If he weren\'t so\r\ndisreputable I should make him my secretary. He could write all my\r\nletters for me and generations would rise up and call me witty. Alas,\r\nhowever, he is so moth-eaten by disease and bad company, that I shall\r\nhave to leave him to his underworld. He is not only like an ant, he is\r\nlike a soiled pack of cards. And I doubt whether the whole Pacific could\r\nwash him sweet and fragrant again. But what divine Spanish he speaks and\r\nwhat exquisite things he says in it! That\'s what one gets by hanging\r\naround a theatre and hearing nothing but the conversation of Calder\xc3\xb3n.\r\nAlas, what is the matter with this world, my soul, that it should treat\r\nsuch a being so ill! His eyes are as sad as those of a cow that has been\r\nseparated from its tenth calf_."\r\n\r\n\r\nYou should know first that this Uncle Pio was Camila Perichole\'s maid.\r\nHe was also her singing-master, her coiffeur, her masseur, her reader,\r\nher errand-boy, her banker; rumor added: her father. For example, he\r\ntaught her her parts. There was a whisper around town that Camila could\r\nread and write. The compliment was unfounded; Uncle Pio did her reading\r\nand writing for her. At the height of the season the company put on two\r\nor three new plays a week, and as each one contained a long and flowery\r\npart for the Perichole the mere task of memorization was not a trifle.\r\n\r\nPeru had passed within fifty years from a frontier state to a state in\r\nrenaissance. Its interest in music and the theatre was intense. Lima\r\ncelebrated its feast days by hearing a Mass of Tom\xc3\xa1s Luis da Victoria in\r\nthe morning and the glittering poetry of Calder\xc3\xb3n in the evening. It is\r\ntrue that the Limeans were given to interpolating trivial songs into the\r\nmost exquisite comedies and some lachrymose effects into the austerest\r\nmusic; but at least they never submitted to the boredom of a misplaced\r\nveneration. If they had disliked heroic comedy the Limeans would not\r\nhave hesitated to remain at home; and if they had been deaf to polyphony\r\nnothing would have prevented their going to an earlier service. When the\r\nArchbishop returned from a short trip to Spain, all Lima kept asking:\r\n"What has he brought?" The news finally spread abroad that he had\r\nreturned with tomes of masses and motets by Palestrina, Morales I and\r\nVittoria, as well as thirty-five plays by Tirso de Molina and Ruiz de\r\nAlar\xc3\xa7on and Moreto. There was a civic f\xc3\xaate in his honor. The\r\nchoirboys\' school and the green room of the Comedia were swamped with\r\nthe gifts of vegetables and wheat. All the world was eager to nourish\r\nthe interpreters of so much beauty.\r\n\r\nThis was the theatre in which Camila Perichole gradually made her\r\nreputation. So rich was the repertory and so dependable the prompter\'s\r\nbox that few plays were given more than four times a season. The manager\r\nhad the whole flowering of the 17th Century Spanish drama to draw upon,\r\nincluding many that are now lost to us. The Perichole had appeared in a\r\nhundred plays of Lope de Vega alone. There were many admirable actresses\r\nin Lima during these years, but none better. The citizens were too far\r\naway from the theatres of Spain to realize that she was the best in the\r\nSpanish world. They kept sighing for a glimpse of the stars of Madrid\r\nwhom they had never seen and to whom they assigned vague new\r\nexcellences. Only one person knew for certain that the Perichole was a\r\ngreat performer and that was her tutor Uncle Pio.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nUncle Pio came of a good Castilian house, illegitimately. At the age of\r\nten he ran away to Madrid from his father\'s hacienda and was pursued\r\nwithout diligence. He lived ever after by his wits. He possessed the six\r\nattributes of the adventurer--a memory for names and faces, with the\r\naptitude for altering his own; the gift of tongues; inexhaustible\r\ninvention; secrecy; the talent for falling into conversation with\r\nstrangers; and that freedom from conscience that springs from a contempt\r\nfor the dozing rich he preyed upon. From ten to fifteen he distributed\r\nhandbills for merchants, held horses, and ran confidential errands. From\r\nfifteen to twenty he trained bears and snakes for travelling circuses;\r\nhe cooked, and mixed punches; he hung about the entries of the more\r\nexpensive taverns and whispered informations into the travellers\'\r\nears--sometimes nothing more dubious than that a certain noble house was\r\nreduced to selling its plate and could thus dispense with the commission\r\nof a silversmith. He was attached to all the theatres in town and could\r\napplaud like ten. He spread slanders at so much a slander. He sold\r\nrumors about crops and about the value of land. From twenty to thirty\r\nhis services came to be recognized in very high circles--he was sent out\r\nby the government to inspirit some half-hearted rebellions in the\r\nmountains, so that the government could presently arrive and\r\nwhole-heartedly crush them. His discretion was so profound that the\r\nFrench party used him even when they knew that the Austrian party used\r\nhim also. He had long interviews with the Princesse des Ursins, but he\r\ncame and went by the back stairs. During this phase he was no longer\r\nobliged to arrange gentlemen\'s pleasures, nor to plant little harvests\r\nof calumny.\r\n\r\nHe never did one thing for more than two weeks at a time even when\r\nenormous gains seemed likely to follow upon it. He could have become a\r\ncircus manager, a theatrical director, a dealer in antiquities, an\r\nimporter of Italian silks, a secretary in the Palace or the Cathedral, a\r\ndealer in provisions for the army, a speculator in houses and farms, a\r\nmerchant in dissipations and pleasures. But there seemed to have been\r\nwritten into his personality, through some accident or early admiration\r\nof his childhood, a reluctance to own anything, to be tied down, to be\r\nheld to a long engagement. It was this that prevented his thieving, for\r\nexample. He had stolen several times, but the gains had not been\r\nsufficient to offset his dread of being locked up; he had sufficient\r\ningenuity to escape on the field itself all the police in the world, but\r\nnothing could protect him against the talebearing of his enemies.\r\nSimilarly he had been reduced for a time to making investigations for\r\nthe Inquisition, but when he had seen several of his victims led off in\r\nhoods he felt that he might be involving himself in an institution whose\r\nmovements were not evenly predictable.\r\n\r\nAs he approached twenty, Uncle Pio came to see quite clearly that his\r\nlife had three aims. There was first this need of independence, cast\r\ninto a curious pattern, namely: the desire to be varied, secret and\r\nomniscient. He was willing to renounce the dignities of public life, if\r\nin secret he might feel that he looked down upon men from a great\r\ndistance, knowing more about them than they knew themselves; and with a\r\nknowledge which occasionally passed into action and rendered him an\r\nagent in the affairs of states and persons. In the second place he\r\nwanted to be always near beautiful women, of whom he was always in the\r\nbest and worst sense the worshipper. To be near them was as necessary to\r\nhim as breathing. His reverence for beauty and charm was there for\r\nanyone to see and to laugh at, and the ladies of the theatre and the\r\ncourt and the houses of pleasure loved his connoisseurship. They\r\ntormented him and insulted him and asked his advice and were singularly\r\ncomforted by his absurd devotion. He suffered greatly their rages and\r\ntheir meannesses and their confiding tears; all he asked was to be\r\naccepted casually, to be trusted, to be allowed like a friendly and\r\nslightly foolish dog to come and go in their rooms and to write their\r\nletters for them. He was insatiably curious about their minds and their\r\nhearts. He never expected to be loved by them (borrowing for a moment\r\nanother sense of that word); for that, he carried his money to the\r\nobscurer parts of the city; he was always desperately unprepossessing,\r\nwith his whisp of a moustache and his whisp of a beard and his big\r\nridiculous sad eyes. They constituted his parish; it was from them that\r\nhe acquired the name of Uncle Pio and it was when they were in trouble\r\nthat he most revealed himself; when they fell from favour he lent them\r\nmoney, when they were ill he outlasted the flagging devotion of their\r\nlovers and the exasperation of their maids; when time or disease robbed\r\nthem of their beauty, he served them still for their beauty\'s memory;\r\nand when they died his was the honest grief that saw them as far as\r\npossible on their journey.\r\n\r\nIn the third place he wanted to be near those that loved Spanish\r\nliterature and its masterpieces, especially in the theatre. He had\r\ndiscovered all that treasure for himself, borrowing or stealing from the\r\nlibraries of his patrons, feeding himself upon it in secrecy,--behind\r\nthe scenes, as it were, of his mad life. He was contemptuous of the\r\ngreat persons who for all their education and usage, exhibited no care\r\nnor astonishment before the miracles of word order in Calder\xc3\xb3n and\r\nCervantes. He longed himself to make verses. He never realized that many\r\nof the satirical songs he had written for the vaudevilles passed into\r\nfolk-music and have been borne everywhere along the highroads.\r\n\r\nAs the result of one of those quarrels that arise so naturally in\r\nbrothels his life became too complicated and he removed to Peru. Uncle\r\nPio in Peru was even more versatile than Uncle Pio in Europe. Here too\r\nhe touched upon real-estate, circuses, pleasures, insurrections and\r\nantiques. A Chinese junk had been blown from Canton to America; he\r\ndragged up the beach the bales of deep-red porcelain and sold the bowls\r\nto the collectors of virt\xc3\xba. He traced down the sovereign remedies of the\r\nIncas and started a smart trade in pills. Within four months he knew\r\npractically everyone in Lima. He presently added to this acquaintance\r\nthe inhabitants of scores of seacoast towns, mining camps and\r\nsettlements in the interior. His pretensions to omniscience became more\r\nand more plausible. The Viceroy discovered Uncle Pio and all this\r\nrichness of reference; he engaged his services in many affairs. In the\r\ndecay of his judgment Don Andr\xc3\xa9s had retained one talent, he was a\r\nmaster of the technique of handling confidential servants. He treated\r\nUncle Pio with great tact and some deference; he understood which\r\nerrands the other should not be asked to undertake and he understood his\r\nneed for variety and intermission. Uncle Pio in turn was perpetually\r\nastonished that a prince should make so little use of his position, for\r\npower, or for fantasy, or for sheer delight in the manipulation of other\r\nmen\'s destinies; but the servant loved the master because he could quote\r\nfrom any of Cervantes\' prefaces and because his tongue had a little\r\nCastilian salt about it still. Many a morning Uncle Pio entered the\r\nPalace through corridors where there was no one to cross but a confessor\r\nor a confidential bully and sat with the Viceroy over his morning\r\nchocolate.\r\n\r\nBut for all his activity nothing made Uncle Pio rich. One would have\r\nsaid that he abandoned a venture when it threatened to prosper. Although\r\nno one knew it, he owned a house. It was full of dogs that could add and\r\nmultiply and the top floor was reserved for birds. But even in this\r\nkingdom he was lonely, and proud in his loneliness, as though there\r\nresided a certain superiority in such a solitude. Finally he stumbled\r\nupon an adventure that came like some strange gift from the skies and\r\nthat combined the three great aims of his life: his passion for\r\noverseeing the lives of others, his worship of beautiful women, and his\r\nadmiration for the treasures of Spanish literature. He discovered Camila\r\nPerichole. Her real name was Micaela Villegas. She was singing in caf\xc3\xa9s\r\nat the age of twelve and Uncle Pio had always been the very soul of\r\ncaf\xc3\xa9s. Now as he sat among the guitarists and watched this awkward girl\r\nsinging ballads, imitating every inflection of the more experienced\r\nsingers who had preceded her, the determination entered his mind to play\r\nPygmalion. He bought her. Instead of sleeping locked up in the wine bin,\r\nshe inherited a cot in his house. He wrote songs for her, he taught her\r\nhow to listen to the quality of her tone, and bought her a new dress. At\r\nfirst all she noticed was that it was wonderful not to be whipped, to be\r\noffered hot soups, and to betaught something. But it was Uncle Pio who\r\nwas really dazzled. His rash experiment flourished beyond all prophecy.\r\nThe little twelve-year-old, silent and always a little sullen, devoured\r\nwork. He set her endless exercises in acting and mimicry; he set her\r\nproblems in conveying the atmosphere of a song; he took her to the\r\ntheatres and made her notice all the details of a performance. But it\r\nwas from Camila as a woman that he was to receive his greatest shock.\r\nThe long arms and legs were finally harmonized into a body of perfect\r\ngrace. The almost grotesque and hungry face became beautiful. Her whole\r\nnature became gentle and mysterious and oddly wise; and it all turned to\r\nhim. She could find no fault in him and she was sturdily loyal. They\r\nloved one another deeply but without passion. He resected the slight\r\nnervous shadow that crossed her face when he came too near her. But\r\nthere arose out of this denial itself the perfume of a tenderness, that\r\nghost of passion which, in the most unexpected relationship, can make\r\neven a whole lifetime devoted to irksome duty pass like a gracious\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nThey travelled a great deal, seeking new taverns, for the highest\r\nattribute of a caf\xc3\xa9 singer will always be her novelty. They went to\r\nMexico, their odd clothes wrapped up in the self-same shawl. They slept\r\non beaches, they were whipped at Panama and shipwrecked on some tiny\r\nPacific islands plastered with the droppings of birds. They tramped\r\nthrough jungles delicately picking their way among snakes and beetles.\r\nThey sold themselves out as harvesters in a hard season. Nothing in the\r\nworld was very surprising to them.\r\n\r\nThen began an even harder course of training for the girl, a regimen\r\nthat resembled more the preparation for an acrobat. The instruction was\r\na little complicated by the fact that her rise to favor was very rapid;\r\nand there was some danger that the applause she received would make her\r\ncontent with her work too soon. Uncle Pio never exactly beat her, but he\r\nresorted to a sarcasm that had terrors of its own.\r\n\r\nAt the close of a performance Camila would return to her dressing room\r\nto find Uncle Pio whistling nonchalantly in one corner. She would divine\r\nhis attitude at once and cry angrily:\r\n\r\n"Now what is it? Mother of God, Mother of God, what is it now?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, little pearl. My little Camila of Camilas, nothing."\r\n\r\n"There was something you didn\'t like. Ugly fault-finding thing that you\r\nare. Come on now, what was it? Look, I\'m ready."\r\n\r\n"No, little fish. Adorable morning star, I suppose you did as well as\r\nyou could."\r\n\r\nThe suggestion that she was a limited artist and that certain felicities\r\nwould be forever closed to her never failed to make Camila frantic. She\r\nwould burst into tears: "I wish I had never known you. You poison my\r\nwhole life. You just think I did badly. It pleases you to pretend that\r\nI was bad. All right then, be quiet."\r\n\r\nUncle Pio went on whistling.\r\n\r\n"The fact is I know I was weak to-night, and don\'t need you to tell me\r\nso. So there. Now go away. I don\'t want to see you around. It\'s hard\r\nenough to play that part without coming back and finding you this way."\r\n\r\nSuddenly Uncle Pio would lean forward and ask with angry intensity: "Why\r\ndid you take that speech to the prisoner so fast?"\r\n\r\nMore tears from the Perichole: "Oh God, let me die in peace! One day you\r\ntell me to go faster and another to go slower. Anyway I shall be crazy\r\nin a year or two and then it won\'t matter."\r\n\r\nMore whistling.\r\n\r\n"Besides the audience applauded as never before. Do you hear me? _As\r\nnever before_. There! Too fast or too slow is nothing to them. They\r\nwept. I was divine. That\'s all I care for. Now be silent. Be silent."\r\n\r\nHe was absolutely silent.\r\n\r\n"You may comb my hair, but if you say another word I shall never play\r\nagain. You can find some other girl, that\'s all."\r\n\r\nThereupon he would comb her hair soothingly for ten minutes, pretending\r\nnot to notice the sobs that were shaking her exhausted body. At last she\r\nwould turn quickly and catching one of his hands would kiss it\r\nfrantically: "Uncle Pio, was I so bad? Was I a disgrace to you? Was it\r\nso awful _that you left the theatre_?"\r\n\r\nAfter a long pause Uncle Pio would admit judiciously: "You were good in\r\nthe scene on the ship."\r\n\r\n"But I\'ve been better, Uncle Pio. You remember the night you came back\r\nfrom Cuzco----?"\r\n\r\n"You were pretty good at the close."\r\n\r\n"Was I?"\r\n\r\n"But my flower, my pearl, _was the matter in the speech to the\r\nprisoner_?"\r\n\r\nHere the Perichole would fling her face and arms upon the table amid the\r\npomades, caught up into a tremendous fit of weeping. Only perfection\r\nwould do, only perfection. And that had never come.\r\n\r\nThen beginning in a low voice Uncle Pio would talk for an hour,\r\nanalyzing the play, entering into a world of finesse in matters of voice\r\nand gesture and tempo, and often until dawn they would remain there\r\ndeclaiming to one another the lordly conversation of Calder\xc3\xb3n.\r\n\r\nWhom were these two seeking to please? Not the audiences of Lima. They\r\nhad long since been satisfied. We come from a world where we have known\r\nincredible standards of excellence, and we dimly remember beauties which\r\nwe have not seized again; and we go back to that world. Uncle Pio and\r\nCamila Perichole were tormenting themselves in an effort to establish in\r\nPeru the standards of the theatres in some Heaven whither Calder\xc3\xb3n had\r\npreceded them. The public for which masterpieces are intended is not on\r\nthis earth.\r\n\r\nWith the passing of time Camila lost some of this absorption in her art.\r\nA certain intermittent contempt for acting made her negligent. It was\r\ndue to the poverty of interest in women\'s r\xc3\xb4les throughout Spanish\r\nclassical drama. At a time when the playwrights grouped about the courts\r\nof England and France (a little later, of Venice) were enriching the\r\nparts of women with studies in wit, charm, passion and hysteria, the\r\ndramatists of Spain kept their eyes on their heroes, on gentlemen torn\r\nbetween the conflicting claims of honour, or, as sinners, returning at\r\nthe last moment to the cross. For a number of years Uncle Pio spent\r\nhimself in discovering ways to interest the Perichole in the r\xc3\xb4les that\r\nfell to her. Upon one occasion he was able to announce to Camila that a\r\ngranddaughter of Vico de Barrera had arrived in Peru. Uncle Pio had long\r\nsince communicated to Camila his veneration for great poets and Camila\r\nnever questioned the view that they were a little above the kings and\r\nnot below the saints. So it was in great excitement that the two of them\r\nchose one of the master\'s plays to perform before his granddaughter.\r\nThey rehearsed the poem a hundred times, now in the great joy of\r\ninvention, now in dejection. On the night of the performance Camila\r\npeering out between the folds of the curtain had Uncle Pio point out to\r\nher the little middle-aged woman worn with the cares of penury and a\r\nlarge family; but it seemed to Camila that she was looking at all the\r\nbeauty and dignity in the world. As she waited for the lines that\r\npreceded her entrance she clung to Uncle Pio in reverent silence, her\r\nheart beating loudly. Between the acts she retired to the dusty corner\r\nof the warehouse where no one would find her and sat staring into the\r\ncorners. At the close of the performance Uncle Pio brought the\r\ngranddaughter of Vico de Barrera into Camila\'s room. Camila stood among\r\nthe clothes that hung upon the wall, weeping with happiness and shame.\r\nFinally she flung herself on her knees and kissed the older woman\'s\r\nhands, and the older woman kissed hers, and while the audience went home\r\nand went to bed the Visitor remained telling Camila the little stories\r\nthat had remained in the family, of Vico\'s work and of his habits.\r\n\r\nUncle Pio was at his happiest when a new actress entered the company,\r\nfor the discovery of a new talent at her side never failed to bestir the\r\nPerichole. To Uncle Pio (standing at the back of the auditorium, bent\r\ndouble with joy and malice) it seemed that the body of the Perichole had\r\nbecome an alabaster lamp in which a strong light had been placed.\r\nWithout any resort to tricks or to false emphasis, she set herself to\r\nefface the newcomer. If the play were a comedy she became the very\r\nabstraction of wit, and (as was more likely) it was a drama of wronged\r\nladies and implacable hates, the stage fairly smouldered with her\r\nemotion. Her personality became so electric that if she so much as laid\r\nher hand upon that of a fellow actor a sympathetic shudder ran through\r\nthe audience. But such occasions of excellence became less and less\r\nfrequent. As her technique became sounder, Camila\'s sincerity became\r\nless necessary. Even when she was absentminded the audience did not\r\nnotice the difference and only Uncle Pio grieved.\r\n\r\nCamila had a very beautiful face, or rather a face beautiful save in\r\nrepose. In repose one was startled to discover that the nose was long\r\nand thin, the mouth tired and a little childish, the eyes unsatisfied--a\r\nrather pinched peasant girl, dragged from the caf\xc3\xa9s-chantants and quite\r\nincapable of establishing any harmony between the claims of her art, of\r\nher appetites, of her dreams, and of her crowded daily routine. Each of\r\nthese was a world in itself, and the warfare between them would soon\r\nhave reduced to idiocy (or triviality) a less tenacious physique. We\r\nhave seen that in spite of her discontent with her parts, the Perichole\r\nknew very well the joy that might reside in acting and warmed herself\r\nfrom time to time at that flame. But that of love attracted her more\r\noften, though with no greater assurance of happiness, until Jupiter\r\nhimself sent her some pearls.\r\n\r\nDon Andr\xc3\xa9s de Ribera, the Viceroy of Peru, was the remnant of a\r\ndelightful man, broken by the table, the alcove, a grandeeship and ten\r\nyears of exile. As a youth he had accompanied embassies to Versailles\r\nand Rome; he had fought in the wars in Austria; he had been in\r\nJerusalem. He was a widower and childless of an enormous and wealthy\r\nwoman; he had collected coins a little, wines, actresses, orders and\r\nmaps. From the table he had received the gout; from the alcove a\r\ntendency to convulsions; from the grandeeship a pride so vast and\r\npuerile that he seldom heard anything that was said to him and talked to\r\nthe ceiling in a perpetual monologue; from the exile, oceans of boredom,\r\na boredom so persuasive that it was like pain,--he woke up with it and\r\nspent the day with it, and it sat by his bed all night watching his\r\nsleep. Camila was passing the years in the hard-working routine of the\r\ntheatre, savoured by a few untidy love-affairs, when this Olympian\r\npersonage (for he had a face and port fit to play gods and heroes on the\r\nscene) suddenly transported her to the most delicious midnight suppers\r\nat the Palace. Contrary to all the traditions of the stage and state she\r\nadored her elderly admirer; she thought she was going to be happy\r\nforever. Don Andr\xc3\xa9s taught the Perichole a great many things and to her\r\nbright eager mind that was one of the sweetest ingredients of love. He\r\ntaught her a little French; to be neat and clean; the modes of address.\r\nUncle Pio had taught her how great ladies carry themselves on great\r\noccasions; he taught her how they relax. Uncle Pio and Calder\xc3\xb3n had\r\ntrained her in beautiful Spanish; Don Andr\xc3\xa9s furnished her with the\r\nsmart slang of _El Buen Retiro_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nUncle Pio was made anxious by Camila\'s invitation from the Palace. He\r\nwould have much preferred that she continue with her little vulgarian\r\nlove-affairs in the theatrical ware-house. But when he saw that her art\r\nwas gaining a new finish he was well content. He would sit in the back\r\nof the theatre, rolling about in his seat for sheer joy and amusement,\r\nwatching the Perichole intimate to the audience that she frequented the\r\ngreat world about whom the dramatists wrote. She had a new way of\r\nfingering a wine-glass, of exchanging an adieu, a new way of entering a\r\ndoor that told everything. To Uncle Pio nothing else mattered. What was\r\nthere in the world more lovely than a beautiful woman doing justice to a\r\nSpanish masterpiece?--a performance (he asks you), packed with\r\nobservation, in which the very spacing of the words revealed a comment\r\non life and on the text--delivered by a beautiful voice--illustrated by\r\na faultless carriage, considerable personal beauty and irresistible\r\ncharm. "We are almost ready to take this marvel to Spain," he would\r\nmurmur to himself. After the performance he would go around to her\r\ndressing-room and say "Very good!" But before taking his leave he would\r\nmanage to ask her where, in the name of the eleven thousand virgins of\r\nCologne, she had acquired that affected way of saying _Excelencia_.\r\n\r\nAfter a time the Viceroy asked the Perichole whether it would amuse her\r\nto invite a few discreet guests to their midnight suppers, and he asked\r\nher whether she would like to meet the Archbishop. Camila was delighted.\r\nThe Archbishop was delighted. On the eve of their first meeting he sent\r\nthe actress an emerald pendant as big as a playing-card.\r\n\r\nThere was something in Lima that was wrapped up in yards of violet satin\r\nfrom which protruded a great dropsical head and two fat pearly hands;\r\nand that was its archbishop. Between the rolls of flesh that surrounded\r\nthem looked out two black eyes speaking discomfort, kindliness and wit.\r\nA curious and eager soul was imprisoned in all this lard, but by dint of\r\nnever refusing himself a pheasant or a goose or his daily procession of\r\nRoman wines, he was his own bitter jailer. He loved his cathedral; he\r\nloved his duties; he was very devout. Some days he regarded his bulk\r\nruefully; but the distress of remorse was less poignant than the\r\ndistress of fasting and he was presently found deliberating over the\r\nsecret messages that a certain roast sends to the certain salad that\r\nwill follow it. And to punish himself he led an exemplary life in every\r\nother respect.\r\n\r\nHe had read all the literature of antiquity and forgotten all about it\r\nexcept a general aroma of charm and disillusion. He had been learned in\r\nthe Fathers and the Councils and forgotten all about them save a\r\nfloating impression of dissensions that had no application to Peru. He\r\nhad read all the libertine masterpieces of Italy and France and reread\r\nthem annually; even in the torments of the stone (happily dissolved by\r\ndrinking the water from the springs of Santa Mar\xc3\xada de Cluxambuqua), he\r\ncould find nothing more nourishing than the anecdotes of Brant\xc3\xb4me and\r\nthe divine Aretino.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop knew that most of the priests of Peru were scoundrels. It\r\nrequired all his delicate Epicurean education to prevent his doing\r\nsomething about it; he had to repeat over to himself his favourite\r\nnotions: that the injustice and unhappiness in the world is a constant;\r\nthat the theory of progress is a delusion; that the poor, never having\r\nknown happiness, are insensible to misfortune. Like all the rich he\r\ncould not bring himself to believe that the poor (look at their houses,\r\nlook at their clothes) could really suffer. Like all the cultivated he\r\nbelieved that only the widely-read could be said to _know_ that they\r\nwere unhappy. On one occasion, the iniquities in his see having been\r\ncalled to his notice, he almost did something about it. He had just\r\nheard that it was becoming a rule in Peru for priests to exact two\r\nmeasures of meal for a fairly good absolution, and five measures, for a\r\nreally effective one. He trembled with indignation; he roared to his\r\nsecretary and bidding him bring up his writing materials, announced that\r\nhe was going to dictate an overwhelming message to his shepherds. But\r\nthere was no ink left in the inkwell; there was no ink left in the next\r\nroom; there was no ink to be found in the whole palace. This state of\r\nthings in his household so upset the good man that he fell ill of the\r\ncombined rages and learned to guard himself against indignations.\r\n\r\nThe addition of the Archbishop to the suppers was so successful that Don\r\nAndr\xc3\xa9s began to think of new names. He had grown increasingly dependent\r\nupon Uncle Pio, but waited until Camila should propose his inclusion of\r\nher own accord. And in due time Uncle Pio brought with him that courser\r\nof the seas, the Captain Alvarado. Generally the reunion had been\r\nseveral hours under way before Camila was able to join them after her\r\nperformance at the theatre. She would arrive towards one o\'clock,\r\nradiant and bejewelled and very tired. The four men received her as they\r\nwould a great queen. For an hour or so she would carry the conversation,\r\nbut gradually reclining more and more against Don Andr\xc3\xa9s\' shoulder she\r\nwould follow the talk as it flitted from one humorous lined face to the\r\nother. All night they talked, secretly comforting their hearts that\r\nlonged always for Spain and telling themselves that such a symposium was\r\nafter the manner of the high Spanish soul. They talked about ghosts and\r\nsecond-sight, and about the earth before man appeared upon it and about\r\nthe possibility of the planets striking against one another; about\r\nwhether the soul can be seen, like a dove, fluttering away at the moment\r\nof death; they wondered whether at the second coming of Christ to\r\nJerusalem, Peru would be long in receiving the news. They talked until\r\nthe sun rose, about wars and kings, about poets and scholars, and about\r\nstrange countries. Each one poured into the conversation his store of\r\nwise sad anecdotes and his dry regret about the race of men. The flood\r\nof golden light struck across the Andes and entering the great window\r\nfell upon the piles of fruit, the stained brocade upon the table, and\r\nthe sweet thoughtful forehead of the Perichole as she lay sleeping\r\nagainst the sleeve of her protector. There would ensue a long pause, no\r\none wishing to make the first move to go, and the glances of them all\r\nwould rest upon this strange beautiful bird who lived among them. But\r\nUncle Pio\'s glance had been upon her all night, a quick glance from his\r\nblack eyes, full of tenderness and anxiety, resting on the great secret\r\nand reason of his life.\r\n\r\nBut Uncle Pio never ceased watching Camila. He divided the inhabitants\r\nof this world into two groups, into those who had loved and those who\r\nhad not. It was a horrible aristocracy, apparently, for those who had no\r\ncapacity for love (or rather for suffering in love) could not be said to\r\nbe alive and certainly would not live again after their death. They were\r\na kind of straw population, filling the world with their meaningless\r\nlaughter and tears and chatter and disappearing still lovable and vain\r\ninto thin air. For this distinction he cultivated his own definition of\r\nlove that was like no other and that had gathered all its bitterness and\r\npride from his odd life. He regarded love as a sort of cruel malady\r\nthrough which the elect are required to pass in their late youth and\r\nfrom which they emerge, pale and wrung, but ready for the business of\r\nliving. There was (he believed) a great repertory of errors mercifully\r\nimpossible to human beings who had recovered from this illness.\r\nUnfortunately there remained to them a host of failings, but at least\r\n(from among many illustrations) they never mistook a protracted\r\namiability for the whole conduct of life, they never again regarded any\r\nhuman being, from a prince to a servant, as a mechanical object. Uncle\r\nPio never ceased watching Camila because it seemed to him that she had\r\nnever undergone this initiation. In the months that followed her\r\nintroduction to the Viceroy he held his breath and waited. He held his\r\nbreath for years. Camila bore the Viceroy three children, yet remained\r\nthe same. He knew that the first sign of her entrance into the true\r\npossession of the world would be the mastery of certain effects in her\r\nacting. There were certain passages in the plays that she would compass\r\nsome day, simply, easily, and with secret joy, because they alluded to\r\nthe new rich wisdom of her heart; but her treatment of such passages\r\nbecame more and more cursory, not to say embarrassed. He presently saw\r\nthat she had tired of Don Andr\xc3\xa9s and had returned to a series of\r\nfurtive love-affairs with the actors and matadors and merchants of the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nShe became more and more impatient of acting and another parasite found\r\nits way into her mind. She wanted to be a lady. She slowly contracted a\r\ngreed for respectability and began to refer to her acting as a pastime.\r\nShe acquired a duenna and some footmen and went to church at the\r\nfashionable hours. She attended the prize days at the University and\r\nappeared among the donors of the great charities. She even learned to\r\nread and write a little. Any faint discrimination against, her as a\r\nbohemian she challenged with fury. She led the Viceroy a horrible life\r\nwith her passion for concessions and her gradual usurpation of\r\nprivileges. The new vice displaced the old and she became noisily\r\nvirtuous. She invented some parents and produced some cousins. She\r\nobtained an undocumented legitimatization of her children. In society\r\nshe cultivated a delicate and languid magdelinism, as a great lady\r\nmight, and she carried a candle in the penitential parades, side by side\r\nwith ladies who had nothing to regret but an outburst of temper and a\r\nfurtive glance into Descartes. Her sin had been acting and everyone\r\nknows that there were even saints who had been actors,--there was Saint\r\nGelasius and Saint Genesius and Saint Margaret of Antioch and Saint\r\nPelagia.\r\n\r\nThere was a fashionable watering place in the hills not far from Santa\r\nMar\xc3\xada de Cluxambuqua. Don Andr\xc3\xa9s had travelled in France and had\r\nthought to build himself a little mock Vichy; there was a pagoda, some\r\ndrawing-rooms, a theatre, a little arena for bull-fights and some French\r\ngardens. Camila\'s health had never known a shadow, but she built herself\r\na villa in the vicinity and sipped the hateful waters at eleven o\'clock.\r\nThe Marquesa de Montemayor has left a brilliant picture of this _op\xc3\xa9ra\r\nbouffe_ paradise with the reigning divinity parading her fierce\r\nsensitiveness along the avenues of powdered shell and receiving the\r\nhomage of all those who could not afford to offend the Viceroy. Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nMar\xc3\xada draws a portrait of this ruler, stately and weary, gambling all\r\nthrough the night in sums that would have raised another Escurial. And\r\nbeside him she sets the portrait of his son, Camila\'s little Don Jaime.\r\nDon Jaime, at seven years, was a rachitic little body who seemed to have\r\ninherited not only his mother\'s forehead and eyes, but his father\'s\r\nliability to convulsions. He bore his pain with the silent bewilderment\r\nof an animal, and like an animal he was mortally ashamed when any\r\nevidences of it occurred in public. He was so beautiful that the more\r\ntrivial forms of pity were hushed in his presence and his long thoughts\r\nabout his difficulties had given his face a patient and startling\r\ndignity. His mother dressed him in garnet velvet, and when he was able\r\nhe followed her about at a distance of several yards, extricating\r\nhimself gravely from the ladies who tried to detain him in conversation.\r\nCamila was never cross to Don Jaime and she was never demonstrative.\r\nWhen the sun was shining the two could be seen walking along those\r\nartificial terraces in silence, Camila wondering when the felicity would\r\nbegin that she had always associated with social position, Don Jaime\r\nrejoicing merely in the sunlight and anxiously estimating the approach\r\nof a cloud. They looked like figures that had strayed there from some\r\nremote country, or out of an old ballad, that had not yet learned the\r\nnew language and had not yet found any friends.\r\n\r\nCamila was about thirty when she left the stage and it required five\r\nyears for her to achieve her place in society. She gradually became\r\nalmost stout, though her head seemed to grow more beautiful every year.\r\nShe took to overdressing and the floors of the drawing-rooms reflected a\r\nveritable tower of jewels and scarves and plumes. Her face and hands\r\nwere covered with a bluish powder against which she drew an irritable\r\nmouth in scarlet and orange. The almost distraught fury of her temper\r\nwas varied by the unnatural sweetness of her address in the company of\r\nthe dowagers. In the earliest stages of her progress upward she had\r\nintimated to Uncle Pio that he was not to be seen with her in public,\r\nbut finally she became impatient even of his discreeter visits. She\r\nconducted the interviews with formality and evasion. Her eyes never\r\ncrossed his and she angled for pretexts to quarrel with him. Still he\r\nventured out once a month to try her patience and when the call had\r\nbecome impossible he would climb the stairs and finish the hour among\r\nher children.\r\n\r\nOne day he arrived at her villa in the hills and, through her maid,\r\nbegged for an opportunity to talk with her. He was told that she would\r\nsee him in the French gardens a little before sunset. He had come up\r\nfrom Lima on a strange sentimental impulse. Like all solitary persons he\r\nhad invested friendship with a divine glamour: he imagined that the\r\npeople he passed on the street, laughing together and embracing when\r\nthey parted, the people who dined together with so many smiles,--you\r\nwill scarcely believe me, but he imagined that they were extracting from\r\nall that congeniality great store of satisfaction. So that suddenly he\r\nwas filled with the excitement of seeing her again, of being called\r\n"Uncle Pio," and of reviving for a moment the trust and humour of their\r\nlong vagabondage.\r\n\r\nThe French Gardens were at the southern end of the town. Behind them\r\nrose the higher Andes and before them there was a parapet overlooking a\r\ndeep valley and overlooking wave after wave of hills that stretched\r\ntoward the Pacific. It was the hour when bats fly low and the smaller\r\nanimals play recklessly underfoot. A few solitaries lingered about the\r\ngardens, gazing dreamily into the sky that was being gradually emptied\r\nof its colour, or leaned upon the balustrade and looked down into the\r\nvalley, noting in which village a dog was barking. It was the hour when\r\nthe father returns home from the fields and plays for a moment in the\r\nyard with the dog that jumps upon him, holding his muzzle closed or\r\nthrowing him upon his back. The young girls look about for the first\r\nstar to fix a wish upon it, and the boys grow restless for supper. Even\r\nthe busiest mother stands for a moment idle-handed, smiling at her dear\r\nand exasperating family.\r\n\r\nUncle Pio stood against one of the chipped marble benches and watched\r\nCamila coming towards him:\r\n\r\n"I am late," she said. "I am sorry. What is it you wish to say to me?"\r\n\r\n"Camila,--" he began.\r\n\r\n"My name is Do\xc3\xb1a Micaela."\r\n\r\n"I do not wish to offend you, Do\xc3\xb1a Micaela, but when you let me call\r\nyou Camila for twenty years, I should think----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, do as you like. Do as you like."\r\n\r\n"Camila, promise me that you will listen to me. Promise me that you will\r\nnot run away at my first sentence."\r\n\r\nAt once she burst out with unexpected passion: "Uncle Pio, listen to me.\r\nYou are mad if you think you can make me return to the theatre. I look\r\nback at the theatre with horror. Understand that. The theatre! The\r\ntheatre, indeed! The daily payment of insults in that filthy place.\r\nUnderstand that you are wasting your time."\r\n\r\nHe answered gently: "I would not have you come back if you are happy\r\nwith these new friends."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t like my new friends, then?" she answered quickly. "Whom do\r\nyou offer me in their stead?"\r\n\r\n"Camila, I only remember ..."\r\n\r\n"I will not be criticized. I don\'t want any advice. It will be cold in a\r\nmoment, I must go back to my house. Just give me up, that\'s all. Just\r\nput me out of your mind."\r\n\r\n"Dear Camila, don\'t be angry. Let me talk to you. Just suffer me for ten\r\nminutes."\r\n\r\nHe did not understand why she was weeping. He did not know what to say.\r\nHe talked at random: "You never even come to see the theatre, and they\r\nall notice it. The audiences are falling away now, too. They only put on\r\nthe Old Comedy twice a week; all the other nights there are these new\r\nfarces in prose. All is dull and childish and indecent. No one can speak\r\nSpanish any more. No one can even walk correctly any more. On Corpus\r\nChristi Day they gave _Belshazzar\'s Feast_ where you were so wonderful.\r\nNow it was shameful."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. A beautiful procession of clouds, like a flock of\r\nsheep, was straying up from the sea, slipping up the valleys between the\r\nhills. Camila suddenly touched his knee, and her face was like her face\r\ntwenty years before: "Forgive me, Uncle Pio, for being so bad. Jaime was\r\nill this afternoon. There\'s nothing one can do. He lies there, so white\r\nand ... so surprised. One must just think of other things. Uncle Pio, it\r\nwould be no good if I went back to the theatre. The audiences come for\r\nthe prose farces. We were foolish to try and keep alive the Old Comedy.\r\nLet people read the old plays in books if they choose to. It is not\r\nworth while fighting with the crowd."\r\n\r\n"Wonderful Camila, I was not just to you when you were on the stage. It\r\nwas some foolish pride in me. I grudged you the praise that you\r\ndeserved. Forgive me. You have always been a very great artist. If you\r\ncome to see that you are not happy among these people you might think\r\nabout going to Madrid. You would have a great triumph there. You are\r\nstill young and beautiful. There will be time later to be called Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nMicaela. We shall be old soon. We shall be dead soon."\r\n\r\n"No, I shall never see Spain. All the world is alike, Madrid or Lima."\r\n\r\n"Oh, if we could go away to some island where the people would know you\r\nfor yourself. And love you."\r\n\r\n"You are fifty years old and you are still dreaming of such islands,\r\nUncle Pio."\r\n\r\nHe bent his head and mumbled: "Of course I love you, Camila, as I always\r\nmust and more than I can say. To have known you is enough for my whole\r\nlife. You are a great lady now. And you are rich. There is no longer any\r\nway that I can help you. But I am always ready."\r\n\r\n"How absurd you are," she said smiling. "You said that as boys say it.\r\nYou don\'t seem to learn as you grow older, Uncle Pio. There is no such\r\nthing as that kind of love and that kind of island. It\'s in the theatre\r\nyou find such things."\r\n\r\nHe look shamefaced, but unconvinced.\r\n\r\nAt last she rose and said sadly: "What are we talking about! It is\r\ngrowing cold. I must be going in. You must be resigned. I have no heart\r\nfor the theatre." There was a pause. "And for the rest?... Oh, I do not\r\nunderstand. It is just circumstance. I must be what I must. Do not try\r\nto understand either. Don\'t think about me, Uncle Pio. Just forgive,\r\nthat\'s all. Just try to forgive."\r\n\r\nShe stood still a moment, searching for something deeply felt to say to\r\nhim. The first cloud reached the terrace; it was dark; the last\r\nstragglers were leaving the gardens. She was thinking of Don Jaime, and\r\nof Don Andr\xc3\xa9s and of himself. She could not find the words. Suddenly\r\nshe bent down and kissed his fingers and went quickly away. But he sat\r\nfor a long time in the gathering clouds trembling with happiness and\r\ntrying to penetrate into the meaning of these things.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the news was all over Lima. Do\xc3\xb1a Micaela Villegas, the lady\r\nthat used to be Camila the Perichole, had the small-pox. Several hundred\r\nother persons had the small-pox also, but popular interest and malignity\r\nwere concentrated upon the actress. A wild hope ran about the town that\r\nthe beauty would be impaired that had enabled her to despise the class\r\nfrom which she sprang. The news escaped from the sick-room that Camila\r\nhad become ludicrous in homeliness and the cup of the envious\r\noverflowed. As soon as she was able she had herself carried from the\r\ncity to her villa in the hills; she ordered the sale of her elegant\r\nlittle palace. She returned her jewels to their givers and she sold her\r\nfine clothes. The Viceroy, the Archbishop, and the few men at court who\r\nhad been her sincerest admirers besieged her door still with messages\r\nand gifts; the messages were ignored and the gifts were returned without\r\ncomment. No one but her nurse and maids had been permitted to see her\r\nsince the commencement of her illness. As an answer to his repeated\r\nattempts Don Andr\xc3\xa9s received a large sum of money from her with a\r\nletter compounded of all that is possible in bitterness and pride.\r\n\r\nLike all beautiful women who have been brought up amid continual\r\ntributes to her beauty she assumed without cynicism that it must\r\nnecessarily be the basis of anyone\'s attachment to herself; henceforth\r\nany attention paid to her must spring from a pity full of condescension\r\nand faintly perfumed with satisfaction at so complete a reversal. This\r\nassumption that she need look for no more devotion now that her beauty\r\nhad passed proceeded from the fact that she had never realized any love\r\nsave love as passion. Such love, though it expends itself in generosity\r\nand thoughtfulness, though it give birth to visions and to great poetry,\r\nremains among the sharpest expressions of self-interest. Not until it\r\nhas passed through a long servitude, through its own self-hatred,\r\nthrough mockery, through great doubts, can it take its place among the\r\nloyalties. Many who have spent a lifetime in it can tell us less of love\r\nthan the child that lost a dog yesterday. As her friends continued in\r\ntheir efforts to draw her again into society she grew more and more\r\nangry and dispatched insulting messages to the city. It was said for a\r\ntime that she was retiring into religion. But new rumours that all was\r\nfury and despair on the little farm, contradicted the old. For those\r\nnear to her the despair was fearful to behold. She was convinced that\r\nher life was over, her life and children\'s. In her hysterical pride she\r\nhad given back more than she owed and the approach of poverty was added\r\nto the loneliness and the gloom of her future. There was nothing left\r\nfor her to do but to draw out her days in jealous solitude in the center\r\nof the little farm that was falling into decay. She brooded for hours\r\nupon the joy of her enemies and could be heard striding about her room\r\nwith strange cries.\r\n\r\nUncle Pio did not allow himself to be discouraged. By dint of making\r\nhimself useful to the children, by taking a hand in the management of\r\nthe farm and by discreetly lending her some money he obtained his\r\nentrance into the house and even into the presence of its veiled\r\nmistress. But even then Camila, convinced in her pride that he _pitied_\r\nher, lashed him with the blade of her tongue and derived some strange\r\ncomfort from heaping him with sneers. He loved her the more,\r\nunderstanding better than she did herself all the stages in the\r\nconvalescence of her humiliated spirit. But one day an accident befell\r\nthat lost him his share in her progress. He pushed open a door.\r\n\r\nShe thought she had locked it. For just one hour a foolish secret hope\r\nhad come to her; she wondered whether she could make a paste of chalk\r\nand cream to spread upon her face. She who had sneered so often at the\r\nbefloured grandmothers of the court wondered for a few moments whether\r\nshe had learned anything on the stage that would aid her now. She\r\nthought she had locked the door and with hurried hands and beating heart\r\nshe laid on the coat, the grotesque pallor, and as she gazed into the\r\nmirror and recognized the futility of her attempt she caught the image\r\nof Uncle Pio standing in the door amazed. She rose from the chair with a\r\ncry and covered her face with her hands.\r\n\r\n"Go away. Go away out of my house forever," she screamed. "I never want\r\nto see you again." In her shame she drove him out with blasphemy and\r\nhatred, she pursued him down the corridor and hurled objects down the\r\nstairs. She gave her farmer orders that Uncle Pio was forbidden to come\r\ninto the grounds. But he continued for a week trying to see her again.\r\nAt last he went back to Lima; he filled in the time as best he could,\r\nbut he longed to be by her as a boy of eighteen would long. At last he\r\ndevised a stratagem and returned up into the hills to put it into\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nOne morning before dawn he arose and lay on the ground below her window.\r\nHe imitated in the darkness the sound of weeping, and, as nearly as he\r\ncould, of a young girl\'s weeping. He continued in this for the whole\r\nquarter of an hour. He did not let his voice rise above that degree of\r\nloudness which Italian musicians would represent by the direction piano,\r\nbut he frequently intermitted the sound trusting that if she were asleep\r\nit would insinuate itself into her mind as well by duration as by\r\ndegree. The air was cool and agreeable. The first faint streak of\r\nsapphire was appearing behind the peaks and in the east the star of\r\nmorning was pulsating every moment with a more tender intention. A\r\nprofound silence wrapped all the farm buildings, only an occasional\r\nbreeze set all the grasses sighing. Suddenly a lamp was lit in her room\r\nand a moment later the shutter was thrown back and a head wrapped in\r\nveils leaned far out.\r\n\r\n"Who is there?" asked the beautiful voice.\r\n\r\nUncle Pio remained silent.\r\n\r\nCamila said again in a tone edged with impatience:\r\n\r\n"Who is there? Who is there weeping?"\r\n\r\n"Do\xc3\xb1a Micaela, my lady, I beg of you to come here to me."\r\n\r\n"Who are you and what do you want?"\r\n\r\n"I am a poor girl. I am Estrella. I beg of you to come and help me. Do\r\nnot call your maid. I pray you, Do\xc3\xb1a Micaela, to come yourself."\r\n\r\nCamila was silent a moment, then said abruptly: "Very well," and closed\r\nthe shutter. Presently she appeared around the corner of the house. She\r\nwore a thick cloak that dragged in the dew. She stood at a distance and\r\nsaid: "Come over here to where I am standing,--Who are you?"\r\n\r\nUncle Pio rose up. "Camila, it is I,--Uncle Pio. Forgive me, but I must\r\nspeak to you."\r\n\r\n"Mother of God, when shall I be free of this dreadful person!\r\nUnderstand: I want to see no one. I don\'t want to speak to a soul. My\r\nlife is over. That is all."\r\n\r\n"Camila, by our long life together, I beg of you to grant me one thing.\r\nI shall go away and never trouble you again."\r\n\r\n"I grant you nothing, nothing. Stay away from me."\r\n\r\n"I promise you I shall never trouble you again if you listen to me this\r\nonce." She was hurrying around to the door on the other side of the\r\nhouse and Uncle Pio was obliged to run beside her to make sure that she\r\nheard what he was saying. She stopped:\r\n\r\n"What is it then? Hurry. It is cold. I am not well. I must go back to my\r\nroom."\r\n\r\n"Camila, let me take Don Jaime for a year to live with me in Lima. Let\r\nme be his teacher. Let me teach him the Castilian. Here he is left among\r\nthe servants. He is learning nothing."\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Camila, what will become of him? He has a good mind and he wants to\r\nlearn."\r\n\r\n"He is sick. He is delicate. Your house is a sty. Only the country is\r\ngood for him."\r\n\r\n"But he has been much better these last few months. I promise you I\r\nshall clean out my house. I shall apply to Madre Mar\xc3\xada del Pilar for a\r\nhousekeeper. Here he is in your stables all day. I shall teach him all\r\nthat a gentleman should know,--fencing and Latin and music. We shall\r\nread all...."\r\n\r\n"A mother cannot be separated from her child like that. It is\r\nimpossible. You are crazy to have thought of it. Give up thinking of me\r\nand of everything about me. I no longer exist. I and my children will\r\nget on as best we can. Do not try to disturb me again. I do not want to\r\nsee any human being."\r\n\r\nNow it was that Uncle Pio felt obliged to use a hard measure. "Then pay\r\nme the money that you owe me," he said.\r\n\r\nCamila stood still, confounded. To herself she said: "Life is too\r\nfearful to bear. When may I die?" After a moment she answered him, in a\r\nhoarse voice: "I have very little money. I will pay you what I can. I\r\nwill pay you now. I have a few jewels here. Then we need never see one\r\nanother again." She was ashamed of her poverty. She took a few steps,\r\nthen turned and said: "Now I see that you are a very hard man. But it is\r\nright that I pay you what I owe you."\r\n\r\n"No, Camila, I only said that to enforce my request. I shall take no\r\nmoney from you. But lend me Don Jaime for one year. I shall love him and\r\ntake every care of him. Did I harm you? Was I a bad teacher to you in\r\nthose other years?"\r\n\r\n"It is cruel of you to keep urging gratitude, gratitude, gratitude. I\r\nwas grateful,--good, good! but now that I am no longer the same woman\r\nthere remains nothing to be grateful for." There was a silence. Her eyes\r\nwere resting on the star that seemed to be leading forth the whole sky\r\nin its wonder. A great pain lay at her heart, the pain of a world that\r\nwas meaningless. Then she said: "If Jaime wishes to go with you, very\r\nwell. I shall talk to, him in the morning. If he wishes to go with you,\r\nyou will find him at the Inn about noon. Good night. Go with God."\r\n\r\n"Go with God."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nShe returned to the house. The next day the grave little boy appeared at\r\nthe Inn. His fine clothes were torn and stained now and he carried a\r\nsmall bundle for change. His mother had given him a gold piece for\r\nspending-money and a little stone that shown in the dark to look at in\r\nhis sleepless nights. They set off together in a cart, but soon Uncle\r\nPio became aware that the jolting was not good for the boy. He carried\r\nhim on his shoulder. As they drew near to the bridge of San Luis Rey,\r\nJaime tried to conceal his shame for he knew that one of those moments\r\nwas coming that separated him from other people. He was especially\r\nashamed because Uncle Pio had just overtaken a friend of his, a\r\nsea-captain. And just as they got to the bridge he spoke to an old lady\r\nwho was travelling with a little girl. Uncle Pio said that when they had\r\ncrossed the bridge they would sit down and rest, but it turned out not\r\nto be necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FIVE: PERHAPS AN INTENTION\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW bridge of stone has been built in the place of the old, but the\r\nevent has not been forgotten. It has passed into proverbial expressions.\r\n"I may see you Tuesday," says a Limean, "unless the bridge falls." "My\r\ncousin lives by the bridge of San Luis Rey," says another, and a smile\r\ngoes around the company, for that also means: under the sword of\r\nDamocles. There are some poems about the accident, classics to be found\r\nin every Peruvian anthology, but the real literary monument is Brother\r\nJuniper\'s book.\r\n\r\nThere are a hundred ways of wondering at circumstance. Brother Juniper\r\nwould never have arrived at his method had it not been for his\r\nfriendship with a certain master in the University of San Mart\xc3\xadn. This\r\nstudent\'s wife had stolen away one morning on a boat for Spain,\r\nfollowing a soldier, and had left him the care of two daughters in their\r\ncradle. He was possessed of all the bitterness that Brother Juniper\r\nlacked and derived a sort of joy from the conviction that all was wrong\r\nin the world. He whispered into the Franciscan\'s ear such thoughts and\r\nanecdotes as belied the notion of a guided world. For a moment a look of\r\ndistress, almost of defeat, would come into the Brother\'s eyes; then he\r\nwould begin patiently explaining why such stories held no difficulty for\r\na believer. "There was a queen of Naples and Sicily," the student would\r\nsay, "who discovered that she was carrying an angry tumor in her side.\r\nIn great dismay she commanded her subjects to fall to their prayers and\r\nordered that all the garments in Sicily and Naples be sewn with votive\r\ncrosses. She was well loved by her people and all their prayers and\r\nembroideries were sincere, but ineffectual. Now she lies in the splendor\r\nof Monreale, and a few inches above her heart may be read the words: _I\r\nshall fear no evil_."\r\n\r\nIt was by dint of hearing a great many such sneers at faith that Brother\r\nJuniper became convinced that the world\'s time had come for proof,\r\ntabulated proof, of the conviction that was so bright and exciting\r\nwithin him. When the pestilence visited his dear village of Puerto and\r\ncarried off a large number of peasants, he secretly drew up a diagram of\r\nthe characteristics of fifteen victims and fifteen survivors, the\r\nstatistics of their value _sub specie aeternitatis_. Each soul was rated\r\nupon a basis of ten as regards its goodness, its diligence in religious\r\nobservance, and its importance to its family group. Here is a fragment\r\nof this ambitious chart:\r\n\r\n\r\n            Goodness     Piety     Usefulness\r\n\r\nAlfonso G.     4           4           10\r\nNina           2           5           10\r\nManuel B.     10          10            0\r\nAlfonso V.    -8         \xe2\x80\x9410           10\r\nVera N.        0          10           10\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thing was more difficult than he had foreseen. Almost every soul in\r\na difficult frontier community turned out to be indispensable\r\neconomically, and the third column was all but useless. The examiner was\r\ndriven to the use of minus terms when he confronted the personal\r\ncharacter of Alfonso V., who was not, like Vera N., merely bad: he was a\r\npropagandist for badness and not merely avoided church but led others to\r\navoid it. Vera N. was indeed bad, but she was a model worshipper and the\r\nmainstay of a full hut. From all this saddening data Brother Juniper\r\ncontrived an index for each peasant. He added up the total for victims\r\nand compared it with the total for survivors, to discover that the dead\r\nwere five times more worth saving. It almost looked as though the\r\npestilence had been directed against the really valuable people in the\r\nvillage of Puerto. And on that afternoon Brother Juniper took a walk\r\nalong the edge of the Pacific. He tore up his findings and cast them\r\ninto the waves; he gazed for an hour upon the great clouds of pearl that\r\nhang forever upon the horizon of that sea, and extracted from their\r\nbeauty a resignation that he did not permit his reason to examine. The\r\ndiscrepancy between faith and the facts is greater than is generally\r\nassumed.\r\n\r\nBut there was another story of the master of San Mart\xc3\xadn (not so\r\nsubversive, this one) that probably gave to Brother Juniper the hint for\r\nhis procedure after the fall of the bridge of San Luis Rey.\r\n\r\nThis master was one day walking through the Cathedral of Lima and\r\nstopped to read the epitaph of a lady. He read with an increasingly\r\nprominent lower lip that she had been for twenty years the centre and\r\njoy of her home, that she had been the delight of her friends, that all\r\nwho met her went away in astonishment at her goodness and beauty, and\r\nthat there she lay awaiting the return of her Lord. Now on the day that\r\nhe read these words, the master of San Mart\xc3\xadn had had much to fret him,\r\nand raising his eyes from the tablet he spoke aloud in his rage: "The\r\nshame of it, the persecution of it! Everyone knows that in the world we\r\ndo nothing but feed our wills. Why perpetuate this legend of\r\nselflessness? Why keep this thing alive, this rumour of\r\ndisinterestedness?"\r\n\r\nAnd so saying he resolved to expose this conspiracy of the\r\nstone-cutters. The lady had been dead only twelve years. He sought out\r\nher servants, her children and her friends. And everywhere he went, like\r\na perfume, her dear traits had survived her and wherever she was\r\nmentioned there arose a suffering smile and the protest that words could\r\nnot describe the gracious ways of her. Even the eager youth of her\r\ngrandchildren, who had never seen her, was made more difficult by the\r\nnews that it was possible to be as good as that. And the man stood\r\namazed; only at last he muttered: "Nevertheless, what I said was true.\r\nThis woman was an exception, perhaps an exception."\r\n\r\nIn compiling his book about these people Brother Juniper seemed to be\r\npursued by the fear that in omitting the slightest detail he might lose\r\nsome guiding hint. The longer he worked the more he felt that he was\r\nstumbling about among great dim intimations. He was forever being\r\ncheated by details that looked as though they were significant if only\r\nhe could find their setting. So he put everything down on the notion\r\nperhaps that if he (or a keener head) reread the book twenty times, the\r\ncountless facts would suddenly start to move, to assemble, and to betray\r\ntheir secret. The Marquesa de Montemayor\'s cook told him that she lived\r\nalmost entirely on rice, fish and a little fruit and Brother Juniper put\r\nit down on the chance that it would some day reveal a spiritual trait.\r\nDon Rub\xc3\xado said of her that she used to appear at his receptions without\r\ninvitation in order to steal the spoons. A midwife on the edge of the\r\ntown declared that Do\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada called upon her with morbid questions\r\nuntil she had been obliged to order her away from the door like a\r\nbeggar. The bookseller of the town reported that she was one of the\r\nthree most cultivated persons in Lima. Her farmer\'s wife declared that\r\nshe was absent-minded, but compact of goodness. The art of biography is\r\nmore difficult than is generally supposed.\r\n\r\nBrother Juniper found that there was least to be learned from those who\r\nhad been most closely associated with the subjects of his inquiry. Madre\r\nMar\xc3\xada del Pilar talked to him at length about Pepita, but she did not\r\ntell him of her own ambitions for her. The Perichole was at first\r\ndifficult of approach, but presently even liked the Franciscan. Her\r\ncharacterization of Uncle Pio flatly contradicted the stores of unsavory\r\ntestimonies that he had acquired elsewhere. Her allusions to her son\r\nwere few and conceded with pain. They closed the interview abruptly. The\r\nCaptain Alvarado told what he could of Esteban and of Uncle Pio. Those\r\nwho know most in this realm, venture least.\r\n\r\nI shall spare you Brother Juniper\'s generalizations. They are always\r\nwith us. He thought he saw in the same accident, the wicked visited by\r\ndestruction and the good called early to Heaven. He thought he saw pride\r\nand wealth confounded as an object lesson to the world, and he thought\r\nhe saw humility crowned and rewarded for the edification of the city.\r\nBut Brother Juniper was not satisfied with his reasons. It was just\r\npossible that the Marquesa de Montemayor was not a monster of avarice,\r\nand Uncle Pio of self-indulgence.\r\n\r\nThe book being done fell under the eyes of some judges and was suddenly\r\npronounced heretical. It was ordered to be burned in the Square with its\r\nauthor. Brother Juniper submitted to the decision that the devil had\r\nmade use of him to effect a brilliant campaign in Peru. He sat in his\r\ncell that last night trying to seek in his own life the pattern that had\r\nescaped him in five others. He was not rebellious. He was willing to lay\r\ndown his life for the purity of the church, but he longed for one voice\r\nsomewhere to testify for him that his intention, at least, had been for\r\nfaith; he thought there was no one in the world who believed him. But\r\nthe next morning in all that crowd and sunlight there were many who\r\nbelieved, for he was much loved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere was a little delegation from the village of Puerto, and Nina\r\n(Goodness 2, Piety 5, Usefulness 10) and others stood with drawn puzzled\r\nfaces while their little friar was given to the congenial flames. Even\r\nthen, even then, there remained in his heart an obstinate nerve\r\ninsisting that at least St. Francis would not utterly have condemned\r\nhim, and (not daring to call upon a greater name, since he seemed so\r\nopen to error in these matters) he called twice upon St. Francis I and\r\nleaning upon a flame he smiled and died.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe day of the service was clear and warm. The Limeans, their black eyes\r\nwide with awe, poured through the streets into their Cathedral and stood\r\ngazing at the mound of black velvet and silver. The Archbishop enclosed\r\nin his wonderful and almost wooden vestments perspired upon his throne,\r\nlending from time to time a connoisseur\'s ear to the felicities of\r\nVittoria\'s counterpoint. The choir had restudied the pages that, as his\r\nfarewell to music, Tom\xc3\xa1s Luis had composed for his friend and patron,\r\nthe Empress of Austria, and all that grief and sweetness, all that\r\nSpanish realism filtering through an Italian mode, rose and fell above\r\nthe sea of mantillas. Don. Andr\xc3\xa9s, under the colours and feathered\r\nhangings of his office, knelt, ill and troubled. He knew that the crowd\r\nwas furtively glancing at him, expecting him to play the father who has\r\nlost his only son. He wondered whether the Perichole was present. He had\r\nnever been obliged to go so long without smoking. The Captain Alvarado\r\npushed in from the sunny square for a moment. He looked across the\r\nfields of black hair and lace at the trooping of the candles and the\r\nropes of incense. "How false, how unreal," he said and pushed his way\r\nout. He descended to the sea and sat on the edge of his boat, gazing\r\ndown into the clear water. "Happy are the drowned, Esteban," he said.\r\n\r\nBehind the screen the Abbess sat among her girls. The night before she\r\nhad torn an idol from her heart and the experience had left her pale but\r\nfirm. She had accepted the fact that it was of no importance whether her\r\nwork went on or not; it was enough to work. She was the nurse who tends\r\nthe sick who never recover; she was the priest who perpetually renews\r\nthe office before an altar to which no worshippers come. There would be\r\nno Pepita to enlarge her work; it would relapse into the indolence and\r\nthe indifference of her colleagues. It seemed to be sufficient for\r\nHeaven that for a while in Peru a disinterested love had flowered and\r\nfaded. She leaned her forehead upon her hand, following the long tender\r\ncurve that the soprano lifts in the Kyrie. "My affection should have had\r\nmore of that colour, Pepita. My whole life should have had more of that\r\nquality. I have been too busy," she added ruefully and her mind drifted\r\ninto prayer.\r\n\r\nCamila had started from the farm to attend the service. Her heart was\r\nfilled with consternation and amazement. Here was another comment from\r\nthe skies; that was the third time she had been spoken to. Her\r\nsmall-pox, Jaime\'s illness, and now the fall of the bridge,--oh, these\r\nwere not accidents. She was as ashamed as though letters had appeared on\r\nher forehead. An order from the Palace announced that the Viceroy was\r\nsending her two daughters to a convent-school in Spain. That was right.\r\nShe was alone. She gathered a few things together mechanically and\r\nstarted to the city for the Service. But she fell to thinking of the\r\ncrowds gaping over her Uncle Pio and over her son; she thought of the\r\nvast ritual of the church, like a chasm into which the beloved falls,\r\nand of the storm of the _dies irae_ where the individual is lost among\r\nthe millions of the dead, features grow dim and traits fade. At a little\r\nmore than half the journey, at the mud church of San Luis Rey she\r\nslipped in and knelt against a pillar to rest. She wandered through her\r\nmemory, searching for the faces of her two. She waited for some emotion\r\nto appear. "But I feel nothing," she whispered to herself. "I have no\r\nheart. I am a poor meaningless woman, that\'s all. I am shut out. I have\r\nno heart. Look, I won\'t try and think of anything; let me just rest\r\nhere." And scarcely had she paused when again that terrible\r\nincommunicable pain swept through her, the pain that could not speak\r\nonce to Uncle Pio and tell him of her love and just once offer her\r\ncourage to Jaime in his sufferings. She started up wildly: "I fail\r\neverybody," she cried. "They love me and I fail them." She returned to\r\nthe farm and carried for a year the mood of her self-despair. One day\r\nshe heard by accident that the wonderful Abbess had lost two persons\r\nwhom she loved in the same accident. Her sewing fell from her hand: then\r\nshe would know, she would explain. "But no, what would she say to me!\r\nShe would not even believe that such a person as I could love or could\r\nlose." Camila decided to go to Lima and look at the Abbess from a\r\ndistance. "If her face tells me that she would not despise me, I will\r\nspeak to her," she said.\r\n\r\nCamila lurked about the convent church and fell humbly in love with the\r\nhomely old face, though it frightened her a little. At last she called\r\nupon her.\r\n\r\n"Mother," she said, "I ... I ..."\r\n\r\n"Do I know you, my daughter?"\r\n\r\n"I was the actress, I was the Perichole."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. Oh, I have wished to know you for a long while, but they told\r\nme you did not wish to be seen. You too, I know, lost in the fall of the\r\nbridge of San...."\r\n\r\nCamila rose and swayed. There! again that access of pain, the hands of\r\nthe dead she could not reach. Her lips were white. Her head brushed the\r\nAbbess\'s knee: "Mother, what shall I do? I am all alone. I have nothing\r\nin the world. I love them. What shall I do?"\r\n\r\nThe Abbess looked at her closely. "My daughter, it is warm here. Let us\r\ngo into the garden. You can rest there." She made a sign to a girl in\r\nthe cloister to bring some water. She continued talking mechanically to\r\nCamila. "I have wished to know you for a long while, se\xc3\xb1ora. Even\r\nbefore the accident I had wished much to know you. They told me that in\r\nthe _autos sacrementales_ you were a very great and beautiful actress,\r\nin _Belshazzar\'s Feast_."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mother, you must not say that. I am a sinner. You must not say\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"Here, drink this, my child. We have a beautiful garden, do you not\r\nthink so? You will come and see us often and some day you will meet\r\nSister Juana who is our gardener-in-chief. Before she entered religion\r\nshe had almost never seen a garden, for she worked in the mines high up\r\nin the mountains. Now everything grows under her hand.--A year has gone\r\nby, se\xc3\xb1ora, since our accident. I lost two who had been children in my\r\norphanage, but you lost a real child of your own?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mother."\r\n\r\n"And a great friend?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mother."\r\n\r\n"Tell me...."\r\n\r\nAnd then the whole tide of Camila\'s long despair, her lonely obstinate\r\ndespair since her girlhood, found its rest on that dusty friendly lap\r\namong Sister Juana\'s fountains and roses.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nBut where are sufficient books to contain the events that would not have\r\nbeen the same without the fall of the bridge? From such a number I\r\nchoose one more.\r\n\r\n"The Condesa d\'Abuirre wishes to see you," said a lay-sister at the door\r\nof the Abbess\'s office.\r\n\r\n"Well," said the Abbess, laying down her pen, "who is she?"\r\n\r\n"She has just come from Spain. I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it is some money, Inez, some money for my house for the blind.\r\nQuick, bid her come in."\r\n\r\nThe tall, rather languorous beauty entered the room. Do\xc3\xb1a Clara, who was\r\ngenerally so adequate, seemed constrained for once. "Are you busy, dear\r\nMother, may I talk to you for a while?"\r\n\r\n"I am quite free, my daughter. You will excuse an old woman\'s memory;\r\nhave I known you before?"\r\n\r\n"My mother was the Marquesa de Montemayor...." Do\xc3\xb1a Clara suspected\r\nthat the Abbess had not admired her mother and would not let the older\r\nwoman speak until she herself had made a long passionate defense of\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada. The languor fell away in her self-reproach. At last the\r\nAbbess told her of Pepita and Esteban, and of Camila\'s visit. "All, all\r\nof us have failed. One wishes to be punished. One is willing to assume\r\nall kinds of penance, but do you know, my daughter, that in love--I\r\nscarcely dare say it--but in love our very mistakes don\'t seem to be\r\nable to last long?"\r\n\r\nThe Condesa showed the Abbess Do\xc3\xb1a Mar\xc3\xada\'s last letter. Madre Mar\xc3\xada\r\ndared not say aloud how great her astonishment was that such words\r\n(words that since then the whole world has murmured over with joy) could\r\nspring in the heart of Pepita\'s mistress. "Now learn," she commanded\r\nherself, "learn at last that anywhere you may expect grace." And she was\r\nfilled with happiness like a girl at this new proof that the traits she\r\nlived for were everywhere, that the world was ready. "Will you do me a\r\nkindness, my daughter? Will you let me show you my work?"\r\n\r\nThe sun had gone down, but the Abbess led the way with a lantern down\r\ncorridor after corridor. Do\xc3\xb1a Clara saw the old and the young, the sick\r\nand the blind, but most of all she saw the tired, bright old woman who\r\nwas leading her. The Abbess would stop in a passageway and say suddenly:\r\n"I can\'t help thinking that something could be done for the\r\ndeaf-and-dumb. It seems to me that some patient person could, ... could\r\nstudy out a language for them. You know there are hundreds and hundreds\r\nin Peru. Do you remember whether anyone in Spain has found a way for\r\nthem? Well, some day they will." Or a little later: "Do you know, I keep\r\nthinking that something can be done for the insane. I am old, you know,\r\nand I cannot go where these things are talked about, but I watch them\r\nsometimes and it seems to me ... In Spain, now, they are gentle with\r\nthem? It seems to me that there is a secret about it, just hidden from\r\nus, just around the corner. Some day back in Spain, if you hear of\r\nanything that would help us, you will write me a letter ... if you are\r\nnot too busy?"\r\n\r\nAt last after Do\xc3\xb1a Clara had seen even the kitchens, the Abbess said:\r\n"Now will you excuse me, for I must go into the room of the very sick\r\nand say a few words for them to think about when they cannot sleep. I\r\nwill not ask you to come with me there, for you are not accustomed to\r\nsuch ... such sounds and things. And besides I only talk to them as one\r\ntalks to children." She looked up at her with her modest rueful smile.\r\nSuddenly she disappeared a moment to return with one of her helpers, one\r\nwho had likewise been involved in the affair of the bridge and who had\r\nformerly been an actress. "She is leaving me," said the Abbess, "for\r\nsome work across the city and when I have spoken here I must leave you\r\nboth, for the flour-broker will not wait for me any longer, and our\r\nargument will take a long time."\r\n\r\nBut Do\xc3\xb1a Clara stood in the door as the Abbess talked to them, the lamp\r\nplaced on the floor beside her. Madre Mar\xc3\xada stood with her back against\r\na post; the sick lay in rows gazing at the ceiling and trying to hold\r\ntheir breaths. She talked that night of all those out in the dark (she\r\nwas thinking of Esteban alone, she was thinking of Pepita alone) who had\r\nno one to turn to, for whom the world perhaps was more than difficult,\r\nwithout meaning. And those who lay in their beds there felt that they\r\nwere within a wall that the Abbess had built for them; within all was\r\nlight and warmth, and without was the darkness they would not exchange\r\neven for a relief from pain and from dying. But even while she was\r\ntalking, other thoughts were passing in the back of her mind. "Even\r\nnow," she thought, "almost no one remembers Esteban and Pepita, but\r\nmyself. Camila alone remembers her Uncle Pio and her son; this woman,\r\nher mother. But soon we shall die and all memory of those five will have\r\nleft the earth, and we ourselves shall be loved for a while and\r\nforgotten. But the love will have been enough; all those impulses of\r\nlove return to the love that made them. Even memory is not necessary for\r\nlove. There is a land of the living and a land of the dead and the\r\nbridge is love, the only survival, the only meaning."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE BRIDGE OF SAN LUIS\r\nREY ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
