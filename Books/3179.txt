Raymond.\r\n\r\nThe name was changed from Eschol to Beriah to accommodate an Eschol\r\nSellers who rose up out of the vasty deeps of uncharted space and\r\npreferred his request\xe2\x80\x94backed by threat of a libel suit\xe2\x80\x94then went his\r\nway appeased, and came no more. In the play Beriah had to be dropped to\r\nsatisfy another member of the race, and Mulberry was substituted in the\r\nhope that the objectors would be tired by that time and let it pass\r\nunchallenged. So far it has occupied the field in peace; therefore we\r\nchance it again, feeling reasonably safe, this time, under shelter of\r\nthe statute of limitations.\r\n\r\nMARK TWAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nHartford, 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WEATHER IN THIS BOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo weather will be found in this book. This is an attempt to pull a\r\nbook through without weather. It being the first attempt of the kind in\r\nfictitious literature, it may prove a failure, but it seemed worth the\r\nwhile of some dare-devil person to try it, and the author was in just\r\nthe mood.\r\n\r\nMany a reader who wanted to read a tale through was not able to do it\r\nbecause of delays on account of the weather. Nothing breaks up an\r\nauthor\xe2\x80\x99s progress like having to stop every few pages to fuss-up the\r\nweather. Thus it is plain that persistent intrusions of weather are bad\r\nfor both reader and author.\r\n\r\nOf course weather is necessary to a narrative of human experience. That\r\nis conceded. But it ought to be put where it will not be in the way;\r\nwhere it will not interrupt the flow of the narrative. And it ought to\r\nbe the ablest weather that can be had, not ignorant, poor-quality,\r\namateur weather. Weather is a literary specialty, and no untrained hand\r\ncan turn out a good article of it. The present author can do only a few\r\ntrifling ordinary kinds of weather, and he cannot do those very good.\r\nSo it has seemed wisest to borrow such weather as is necessary for the\r\nbook from qualified and recognized experts\xe2\x80\x94giving credit, of course.\r\nThis weather will be found over in the back part of the book, out of\r\nthe way. _See Appendix_. The reader is requested to turn over and help\r\nhimself from time to time as he goes along.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a matchless morning in rural England. On a fair hill we see a\r\nmajestic pile, the ivied walls and towers of Cholmondeley Castle, huge\r\nrelic and witness of the baronial grandeurs of the Middle Ages. This is\r\none of the seats of the Earl of Rossmore, K. G. G. C. B. K. C. M. G.,\r\netc., etc., etc., etc., etc., who possesses twenty-two thousand acres\r\nof English land, owns a parish in London with two thousand houses on\r\nits lease-roll, and struggles comfortably along on an income of two\r\nhundred thousand pounds a year. The father and founder of this proud\r\nold line was William the Conqueror his very self; the mother of it was\r\nnot inventoried in history by name, she being merely a random episode\r\nand inconsequential, like the tanner\xe2\x80\x99s daughter of Falaise.\r\n\r\nIn a breakfast room of the castle on this breezy fine morning there are\r\ntwo persons and the cooling remains of a deserted meal. One of these\r\npersons is the old lord, tall, erect, square-shouldered, white-haired,\r\nstern-browed, a man who shows character in every feature, attitude, and\r\nmovement, and carries his seventy years as easily as most men carry\r\nfifty. The other person is his only son and heir, a dreamy-eyed young\r\nfellow, who looks about twenty-six but is nearer thirty. Candor,\r\nkindliness, honesty, sincerity, simplicity, modesty\xe2\x80\x94it is easy to see\r\nthat these are cardinal traits of his character; and so when you have\r\nclothed him in the formidable components of his name, you somehow seem\r\nto be contemplating a lamb in armor: his name and style being the\r\nHonourable Kirkcudbright Llanover Marjoribanks Sellers\r\nViscount-Berkeley, of Cholmondeley Castle, Warwickshire. (Pronounced\r\nK\xe2\x80\x99koobry Thlanover Marshbanks Sellers Vycount Barkly, of Chumly Castle,\r\nWarrikshr.) He is standing by a great window, in an attitude suggestive\r\nof respectful attention to what his father is saying and equally\r\nrespectful dissent from the positions and arguments offered. The father\r\nwalks the floor as he talks, and his talk shows that his temper is away\r\nup toward summer heat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoft-spirited as you are, Berkeley, I am quite aware that when you\r\nhave once made up your mind to do a thing which your ideas of honor and\r\njustice require you to do, argument and reason are (for the time\r\nbeing,) wasted upon you\xe2\x80\x94yes, and ridicule; persuasion, supplication,\r\nand command as well. To my mind\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, if you will look at it without prejudice, without passion, you\r\nmust concede that I am not doing a rash thing, a thoughtless, wilful\r\nthing, with nothing substantial behind it to justify it. _I_ did not\r\ncreate the American claimant to the earldom of Rossmore; I did not hunt\r\nfor him, did not find him, did not obtrude him upon your notice. He\r\nfound himself, he injected himself into our lives\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd has made mine a purgatory for ten years with his tiresome letters,\r\nhis wordy reasonings, his acres of tedious evidence,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich you would never read, would never consent to read. Yet in common\r\nfairness he was entitled to a hearing. That hearing would either prove\r\nhe was the rightful earl\xe2\x80\x94in which case our course would be plain\xe2\x80\x94or it\r\nwould prove that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94in which case our course would be equally\r\nplain. I have read his evidences, my lord. I have conned them well,\r\nstudied them patiently and thoroughly. The chain seems to be complete,\r\nno important link wanting. I believe he is the rightful earl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I a usurper\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94nameless pauper, a tramp! Consider what you are\r\nsaying, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, _if_ he is the rightful earl, would you, could you\xe2\x80\x94that fact\r\nbeing established\xe2\x80\x94consent to keep his titles and his properties from\r\nhim a day, an hour, a minute?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are talking nonsense\xe2\x80\x94nonsense\xe2\x80\x94lurid idiocy! Now, listen to me. I\r\nwill make a confession\xe2\x80\x94if you wish to call it by that name. I did not\r\nread those evidences because I had no occasion to\xe2\x80\x94I was made familiar\r\nwith them in the time of this claimant\xe2\x80\x99s father and of my own father\r\nforty years ago. This fellow\xe2\x80\x99s predecessors have kept mine more or less\r\nfamiliar with them for close upon a hundred and fifty years. The truth\r\nis, the rightful heir did go to America, with the Fairfax heir or about\r\nthe same time\xe2\x80\x94but disappeared\xe2\x80\x94somewhere in the wilds of Virginia, got\r\nmarried, and began to breed savages for the Claimant market; wrote no\r\nletters home; was supposed to be dead; his younger brother softly took\r\npossession; presently the American did die, and straightway his eldest\r\nproduct put in his claim\xe2\x80\x94by letter\xe2\x80\x94letter still in existence\xe2\x80\x94and died\r\nbefore the uncle in-possession found time\xe2\x80\x94or maybe\r\ninclination\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94answer. The infant son of that eldest product grew\r\nup\xe2\x80\x94long interval, you see\xe2\x80\x94and _he_ took to writing letters and\r\nfurnishing evidences. Well, successor after successor has done the\r\nsame, down to the present idiot. It was a succession of paupers; not\r\none of them was ever able to pay his passage to England or institute\r\nsuit. The Fairfaxes kept their lordship alive, and so they have never\r\nlost it to this day, although they live in Maryland; their friend lost\r\nhis by his own neglect. You perceive now, that the facts in this case\r\nbring us to precisely this result: morally the American tramp _is_\r\nrightful earl of Rossmore; legally he has no more right than his dog.\r\nThere now\xe2\x80\x94are you satisfied?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, then the son glanced at the crest carved in the\r\ngreat oaken mantel and said, with a regretful note in his voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince the introduction of heraldic symbols,\xe2\x80\x94the motto of this house\r\nhas been _Suum cuique_\xe2\x80\x94to every man his own. By your own intrepidly\r\nfrank confession, my lord, it is become a sarcasm: If Simon Lathers\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep that exasperating name to yourself! For ten years it has pestered\r\nmy eye\xe2\x80\x94and tortured my ear; till at last my very footfalls time\r\nthemselves to the brain-racking rhythm of _Simon Lathers!\xe2\x80\x94Simon\r\nLathers! \xe2\x80\x94Simon Lathers!_ And now, to make its presence in my soul\r\neternal, immortal, imperishable, you have resolved to\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94what is it you\r\nhave resolved to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo go to Simon Lathers, in America, and change places with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Deliver the reversion of the earldom into his hands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake this tremendous surrender without even trying the fantastic case\r\nin the Lords?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x94s\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d with hesitation and some embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all that is amazing, I believe you are insane, my son. See here\r\n\xe2\x80\x94have you been training with that ass again\xe2\x80\x94that radical, if you prefer\r\nthe term, though the words are synonymous\xe2\x80\x94Lord Tanzy, of Tollmache?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe son did not reply, and the old lord continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you confess. That puppy, that shame to his birth and caste, who\r\nholds all hereditary lordships and privilege to be usurpation, all\r\nnobility a tinsel sham, all aristocratic institutions a fraud, all\r\ninequalities in rank a legalized crime and an infamy, and no bread\r\nhonest bread that a man doesn\xe2\x80\x99t earn by his own work\xe2\x80\x94_work_, pah!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthe old patrician brushed imaginary labor-dirt from his white hands.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have come to hold just those opinions yourself, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nadded with a sneer.\r\n\r\nA faint flush in the younger man\xe2\x80\x99s cheek told that the shot had hit and\r\nhurt; but he answered with dignity:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have. I say it without shame\xe2\x80\x94I feel none. And now my reason for\r\nresolving to renounce my heirship without resistance is explained. I\r\nwish to retire from what to me is a false existence, a false position,\r\nand begin my life over again\xe2\x80\x94begin it right\xe2\x80\x94begin it on the level of\r\nmere manhood, unassisted by factitious aids, and succeed or fail by\r\npure merit or the want of it. I will go to America, where all men are\r\nequal and all have an equal chance; I will live or die, sink or swim,\r\nwin or lose as just a man\xe2\x80\x94that alone, and not a single helping gaud or\r\nfiction back of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear, hear!\xe2\x80\x9d The two men looked each other steadily in the eye a\r\nmoment or two, then the elder one added, musingly, \xe2\x80\x9cAb-so-lutely\r\ncra-zy\xe2\x80\x94ab-solutely!\xe2\x80\x9d After another silence, he said, as one who, long\r\ntroubled by clouds, detects a ray of sunshine, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, there will be one\r\nsatisfaction\xe2\x80\x94Simon Lathers will come here to enter into his own, and I\r\nwill drown him in the horsepond. The poor devil\xe2\x80\x94always so humble in his\r\nletters, so pitiful, so deferential; so steeped in reverence for our\r\ngreat line and lofty-station; so anxious to placate us, so prayerful\r\nfor recognition as a relative, a bearer in his veins of our sacred\r\nblood\xe2\x80\x94and withal so poor, so needy, so threadbare and pauper-shod as to\r\nraiment, so despised, so laughed at for his silly claimantship by the\r\nlewd American scum around him\xe2\x80\x94ah, the vulgar, crawling, insufferable\r\ntramp! To read one of his cringing, nauseating letters\xe2\x80\x94well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis to a splendid flunkey, all in inflamed plush and buttons and\r\nknee-breeches as to his trunk, and a glinting white frost-work of\r\nground-glass paste as to his head, who stood with his heels together\r\nand the upper half of him bent forward, a salver in his hands:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe letters, my lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lord took them, and the servant disappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmong the rest, an American letter. From the tramp, of course. Jove,\r\nbut here\xe2\x80\x99s a change! No brown paper envelope this time, filched from a\r\nshop, and carrying the shop\xe2\x80\x99s advertisement in the corner. Oh, no, a\r\nproper enough envelope\xe2\x80\x94with a most ostentatiously broad mourning\r\nborder\xe2\x80\x94for his cat, perhaps, since he was a bachelor\xe2\x80\x94and fastened with\r\nred wax\xe2\x80\x94a batch of it as big as a half-crown\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94our crest for a\r\nseal!\xe2\x80\x94motto and all. And the ignorant, sprawling hand is gone; he\r\nsports a secretary, evidently\xe2\x80\x94a secretary with a most confident swing\r\nand flourish to his pen. Oh indeed, our fortunes are improving over\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94our meek tramp has undergone a metamorphosis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead it, my lord, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, this time I will.

Yas!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\np027.jpg (32K)\r\n\r\nColonel Mulberry Sellers\xe2\x80\x94this was some days before he wrote his letter\r\nto Lord Rossmore\xe2\x80\x94was seated in his \xe2\x80\x9clibrary,\xe2\x80\x9d which was also his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdrawing-room\xe2\x80\x9d and was also his \xe2\x80\x9cpicture gallery\xe2\x80\x9d and likewise his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwork-shop.\xe2\x80\x9d Sometimes he called it by one of these names, sometimes by\r\nanother, according to occasion and circumstance. He was constructing\r\nwhat seemed to be some kind of a frail mechanical toy; and was\r\napparently very much interested in his work. He was a white-headed man,\r\nnow, but otherwise he was as young, alert, buoyant, visionary and\r\nenterprising as ever. His loving old wife sat near by, contentedly\r\nknitting and thinking, with a cat asleep in her lap. The room was\r\nlarge, light, and had a comfortable look, in fact a home-like look,\r\nthough the furniture was of a humble sort and not over abundant, and\r\nthe knickknacks and things that go to adorn a living-room not plenty\r\nand not costly. But there were natural flowers, and there was an\r\nabstract and unclassifiable something about the place which betrayed\r\nthe presence in the house of somebody with a happy taste and an\r\neffective touch.\r\n\r\nEven the deadly chromos on the walls were somehow without offence; in\r\nfact they seemed to belong there and to add an attraction to the room\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nfascination, anyway; for whoever got his eye on one of them was like to\r\ngaze and suffer till he died\xe2\x80\x94you have seen that kind of pictures. Some\r\nof these terrors were landscapes, some libeled the sea, some were\r\nostensible portraits, all were crimes. All the portraits were\r\nrecognizable as dead Americans of distinction, and yet, through\r\nlabeling added, by a daring hand, they were all doing duty here as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEarls of Rossmore.\xe2\x80\x9d The newest one had left the works as Andrew\r\nJackson, but was doing its best now, as \xe2\x80\x9cSimon Lathers Lord Rossmore,\r\nPresent Earl.\xe2\x80\x9d On one wall was a cheap old railroad map of\r\nWarwickshire. This had been newly labeled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Rossmore Estates.\xe2\x80\x9d On\r\nthe opposite wall was another map, and this was the most imposing\r\ndecoration of the establishment and the first to catch a stranger\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattention, because of its great size. It had once borne simply the\r\ntitle SIBERIA; but now the word \xe2\x80\x9cFUTURE\xe2\x80\x9d had been written in front of\r\nthat word. There were other additions, in red ink\xe2\x80\x94many cities, with\r\ngreat populations set down, scattered over the vast-country at points\r\nwhere neither cities nor populations exist to-day. One of these cities,\r\nwith population placed at 1,500,000, bore the name\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLibertyorloffskoizalinski,\xe2\x80\x9d and there was a still more populous one,\r\ncentrally located and marked \xe2\x80\x9cCapital,\xe2\x80\x9d which bore the name\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFreedomolovnaivanovich.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cmansion\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s usual name for the house\xe2\x80\x94was a rickety old\r\ntwo-story frame of considerable size, which had been painted, some time\r\nor other, but had nearly forgotten it. It was away out in the ragged\r\nedge of Washington and had once been somebody\xe2\x80\x99s country place. It had a\r\nneglected yard around it, with paling fence that needed straightening\r\nup, in places, and a gate that would stay shut. By the door-post were\r\nseveral modest tin signs. \xe2\x80\x9cCol. Mulberry Sellers, Attorney at Law and\r\nClaim Agent,\xe2\x80\x9d was the principal one. One learned from the others that\r\nthe Colonel was a Materializer, a Hypnotizer, a Mind-Cure dabbler; and\r\nso on. For he was a man who could always find things to do.\r\n\r\nA white-headed negro man, with spectacles and damaged white cotton\r\ngloves appeared in the presence, made a stately obeisance and\r\nannounced:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarse Washington Hawkins, suh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Scott! Show him in, Dan\xe2\x80\x99l, show him in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Colonel and his wife were on their feet in a moment, and the next\r\nmoment were joyfully wringing the hands of a stoutish,\r\ndiscouraged-looking man whose general aspect suggested that he was\r\nfifty years old, but whose hair swore to a hundred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, well, Washington, my boy, it _is_ good to look at you\r\nagain. Sit down, sit down, and make yourself at home. There, now\xe2\x80\x94why,\r\nyou look perfectly natural; aging a little, just a little, but you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhave known him anywhere, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you, Polly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, Berry, he\xe2\x80\x99s _just_ like his pa would have looked if he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nlived. Dear, dear, where have you dropped from? Let me see, how long is\r\nit since\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say it\xe2\x80\x99s all of fifteen years, Mrs. Sellers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, how time does get away with us. Yes, and oh, the changes\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden catch of her voice and a trembling of the lip, the\r\nmen waiting reverently for her to get command of herself and go on; but\r\nafter a little struggle she turned away, with her apron to her eyes,\r\nand softly disappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeeing you made her think of the children, poor thing\xe2\x80\x94dear, dear,\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re all dead but the youngest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut banish care, it\xe2\x80\x99s no time for it now\xe2\x80\x94on with the dance, let joy be\r\nunconfined is my motto, whether there\xe2\x80\x99s any dance to dance; or any joy\r\nto unconfine\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll be the healthier for it every time,\xe2\x80\x94every time,\r\nWashington\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s my experience, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a good deal of this world.\r\nCome\xe2\x80\x94where have you disappeared to all these years, and are you from\r\nthere, now, or where are you from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite think you would ever guess, Colonel. Cherokee Strip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy land!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure as you live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t mean it. Actually _living_ out there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes, if a body may call it that; though it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty strong\r\nterm for \xe2\x80\x99dobies and jackass rabbits, boiled beans and slap-jacks,\r\ndepression, withered hopes, poverty in all its varieties\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLouise out there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and the children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut there now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford to bring them with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I see,\xe2\x80\x94you had to come\xe2\x80\x94claim against the government. Make yourself\r\nperfectly easy\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a claim against the government.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo? Want to be postmaster? _That\xe2\x80\x99s_ all right. Leave it to me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfix it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it isn\xe2\x80\x99t postmaster\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re all astray yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good gracious, Washington, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you come out and tell me\r\nwhat it is? What, do you want to be so reserved and distrustful with an\r\nold friend like me for? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you reckon I can keep a se\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no secret about it\xe2\x80\x94you merely don\xe2\x80\x99t give me a chance to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow look here, old friend, I know the human race; and I know that when\r\na man comes to Washington, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if it\xe2\x80\x99s from heaven, let alone\r\nCherokee-Strip, it\xe2\x80\x99s because he _wants_ something. And I know that as a\r\nrule he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to get it; that he\xe2\x80\x99ll stay and try\xe2\x80\x94for another\r\nthing and won\xe2\x80\x99t get that; the same luck with the next and the next and\r\nthe next; and keeps on till he strikes bottom, and is too poor and\r\nashamed to go back, even to Cherokee Strip; and at last his heart\r\nbreaks\xe2\x80\x94and they take up a collection and bury him. There\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ninterrupt me, I know what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about. Happy and prosperous in\r\nthe Far West wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I? _You_ know that. Principal citizen of Hawkeye,\r\nlooked up to by everybody, kind of an autocrat, actually a kind of an\r\nautocrat, Washington. Well, nothing would do but I must go Minister to\r\nSt. James, the Governor and everybody insisting, you know, and so at\r\nlast I consented\xe2\x80\x94no getting out of it, _had_ to do it, so here I came.\r\n_A day too late_, Washington. Think of that\xe2\x80\x94what little things change\r\nthe world\xe2\x80\x99s history\xe2\x80\x94yes, sir, the place had been filled. Well, there I\r\nwas, you see. I offered to compromise and go to Paris. The President\r\nwas very sorry and all that, but _that_ place, you see, didn\xe2\x80\x99t belong\r\nto the West, so there I was again. There was no help for it, so I had\r\nto stoop a little\xe2\x80\x94we all reach the day some time or other when we\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot to do that, Washington, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad thing for us, either,\r\ntake it by and large and all around\xe2\x80\x94I had to stoop a little and offer\r\nto take Constantinople. Washington, consider this\xe2\x80\x94for it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly\r\ntrue\xe2\x80\x94within a month I _asked_ for China; within another month I\r\n_begged_ for Japan; one year later I was away down, down, down,\r\nsupplicating with tears and anguish for the bottom office in the gift\r\nof the government of the United States\xe2\x80\x94Flint-Picker in the cellars of\r\nthe War Department. And by George I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlint-Picker?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Office established in the time of the Revolution, last century.\r\nThe musket-flints for the military posts were supplied from the\r\ncapitol. They do it yet; for although the flint-arm has gone out and\r\nthe forts have tumbled down, the decree hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been repealed\xe2\x80\x94been\r\noverlooked and forgotten, you see\xe2\x80\x94and so the vacancies where old\r\nTiconderoga and others used to stand, still get their six quarts of\r\ngun-flints a year just the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWashington said musingly after a pause:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow strange it seems\xe2\x80\x94to start for Minister to England at twenty\r\nthousand a year and fail for flintpicker at\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree dollars a week. It\xe2\x80\x99s human life, Washington\xe2\x80\x94just an epitome of\r\nhuman ambition, and struggle, and the outcome: you aim for the palace\r\nand get drowned in the sewer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was another meditative silence. Then Washington said, with\r\nearnest compassion in his voice\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so, after coming here, against your inclination, to satisfy your\r\nsense of patriotic duty and appease a selfish public clamor, you get\r\nabsolutely nothing for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing?\xe2\x80\x9d The Colonel had to get up and stand, to get room for his\r\namazement to expand. \xe2\x80\x9c_Nothing_, Washington? I ask you this: to be a\r\nperpetual Member and the _only_ Perpetual Member of a Diplomatic Body\r\naccredited to the greatest country on earth do you call that nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Washington\xe2\x80\x99s turn to be amazed. He was stricken dumb; but the\r\nwide-eyed wonder, the reverent admiration expressed in his face were\r\nmore eloquent than any words could have been. The Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s wounded\r\nspirit was healed and he resumed his seat pleased and content. He\r\nleaned forward and said impressively:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was due to a man who had become forever conspicuous by an\r\nexperience without precedent in the history of the world?\xe2\x80\x94a man made\r\npermanently and diplomatically sacred, so to speak, by having been\r\nconnected, temporarily, through solicitation, with every single\r\ndiplomatic post in the roster of this government, from Envoy\r\nExtraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of St. James\r\nall the way down to Consul to a guano rock in the Strait of\r\nSunda\xe2\x80\x94salary payable in guano\xe2\x80\x94which disappeared by volcanic convulsion\r\nthe day before they got down to my name in the list of applicants.\r\nCertainly something august enough to be answerable to the size of this\r\nunique and memorable experience was my due, and I got it. By the common\r\nvoice of this community, by acclamation of the people, that mighty\r\nutterance which brushes aside laws and legislation, and from whose\r\ndecrees there is no appeal, I was named Perpetual Member of the\r\nDiplomatic Body representing the multifarious sovereignties and\r\ncivilizations of the globe near the republican court of the United\r\nStates of America. And they brought me home with a torchlight\r\nprocession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is wonderful, Colonel, simply wonderful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the loftiest official position in the whole earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think so\xe2\x80\x94and the most commanding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have named the word. Think of it. I frown, and there is war; I\r\nsmile, and contending nations lay down their arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is awful. The responsibility, I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is nothing. Responsibility is no burden to me; I am used to it;\r\nhave always been used to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the work\xe2\x80\x94the work! Do you have to attend all the sittings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho, I? Does the Emperor of Russia attend the conclaves of the\r\ngovernors of the provinces? He sits at home, and indicates his\r\npleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWashington was silent a moment, then a deep sigh escaped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow proud I was an hour ago; how paltry seems my little promotion now!\r\nColonel, the reason I came to Washington is,\xe2\x80\x94I am Congressional\r\nDelegate from Cherokee Strip!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Colonel sprang to his feet and broke out with prodigious\r\nenthusiasm:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me your hand, my boy\xe2\x80\x94this is immense news! I congratulate you\r\nwith all my heart. My prophecies stand confirmed. I always said it was\r\nin you. I always said you were born for high distinction and would\r\nachieve it. You ask Polly if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWashington was dazed by this most unexpected demonstration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Colonel, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing _to_ it. That little narrow, desolate,\r\nunpeopled, oblong streak of grass and gravel, lost in the remote wastes\r\nof the vast continent\xe2\x80\x94why, it\xe2\x80\x99s like representing a billiard table\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ndiscarded one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTut-tut, it\xe2\x80\x99s a great, it\xe2\x80\x99s a staving preferment, and just opulent\r\nwith influence here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShucks, Colonel, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t even a vote.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s nothing; you can make speeches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t. The population\xe2\x80\x99s only two hundred\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t any right to elect me; we\xe2\x80\x99re not even a territory,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no Organic Act, the government hasn\xe2\x80\x99t any official knowledge of\r\nus whatever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind about that; I\xe2\x80\x99ll fix that. I\xe2\x80\x99ll rush the thing through,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll get you organized in no time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Will_ you, Colonel?\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s _too_ good of you; but it\xe2\x80\x99s just your old\r\nsterling self, the same old ever-faithful friend,\xe2\x80\x9d and the grateful\r\ntears welled up in Washington\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just as good as done, my boy, just as good as done. Shake hands.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll hitch teams together, you and I, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll make things hum!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Sellers returned, now, with her composure restored, and began to\r\nask after Hawkins\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and about his children, and the number of\r\nthem, and so on, and her examination of the witness resulted in a\r\ncircumstantial history of the family\xe2\x80\x99s ups and downs and driftings to\r\nand fro in the far West during the previous fifteen years. There was a\r\nmessage, now, from out back, and Colonel Sellers went out there in\r\nanswer to it. Hawkins took this opportunity to ask how the world had\r\nbeen using the Colonel during the past half-generation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s been using him just the same; it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t change its way of\r\nusing him if it wanted to, for he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can easily believe that, Mrs. Sellers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you see, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change, himself\xe2\x80\x94not the least little bit in\r\nthe world\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s always Mulberry Sellers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can see _that_ plain enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust the same old scheming, generous, good-hearted, moonshiny,\r\nhopeful, no-account failure he always was, and still everybody likes\r\nhim just as well as if he was the shiningest success.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey always did: and it was natural, because he was so obliging and\r\naccommodating, and had something about him that made it kind of easy to\r\nask help of him, or favors\xe2\x80\x94you didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel shy, you know, or have that\r\nwish\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94have\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94try feeling that you have with other people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just so, yet; and a body wonders at it, too, because he\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nshamefully treated, many times, by people that had used him for a\r\nladder to climb up by, and then kicked him down when they didn\xe2\x80\x99t need\r\nhim any more. For a time you can see he\xe2\x80\x99s hurt, his pride\xe2\x80\x99s wounded,\r\nbecause he shrinks away from that thing and don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94and so I used to think _now_ he\xe2\x80\x99s learned something and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nmore careful hereafter\xe2\x80\x94but laws! in a couple of weeks he\xe2\x80\x99s forgotten\r\nall about it, and any selfish tramp out of nobody knows where can come\r\nand put up a poor mouth and walk right into his heart with his boots\r\non.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must try your patience pretty sharply sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\np038.jpg (36K)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m used to it; and I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have him so than the other way.\r\nWhen I call him a failure, I mean to the world he\xe2\x80\x99s a failure; he isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nto me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know as I want him different much different, anyway. I\r\nhave to scold him some, snarl at him, you might even call it, but I\r\nreckon I\xe2\x80\x99d do that just the same, if he was different\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s my make. But\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a good deal less snarly and more contented when he\xe2\x80\x99s a failure than\r\nI am when he isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he isn\xe2\x80\x99t always a failure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hawking, brightening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHim? Oh, bless you, no. He makes a strike, as he calls it, from time\r\nto time. Then\xe2\x80\x99s my time to fret and fuss. For the money just\r\nflies\xe2\x80\x94first come first served. Straight off, he loads up the house with\r\ncripples and idiots and stray cats and all the different kinds of poor\r\nwrecks that other people don\xe2\x80\x99t want and he _does_, and then when the\r\npoverty comes again I\xe2\x80\x99ve _got_ to clear the most of them out or we\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nstarve; and that distresses him, and me the same, of course.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s old Dan\xe2\x80\x99l and old Jinny, that the sheriff sold south one of the\r\ntimes that we got bankrupted before the war\xe2\x80\x94they came wandering back\r\nafter the peace, worn out and used up on the cotton plantations,\r\nhelpless, and not another lick of work left in their old hides for the\r\nrest of this earthly pilgrimage\xe2\x80\x94and we so pinched, _oh_ so pinched for\r\nthe very crumbs to keep life in us, and he just flung the door wide,\r\nand the way he received them you\xe2\x80\x99d have thought they had come straight\r\ndown from heaven in answer to prayer. I took him one side and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mulberry we can\xe2\x80\x99t have them\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing for ourselves\xe2\x80\x94we can\xe2\x80\x99t feed\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x99 He looked at me kind of hurt, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Turn them out?\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve come to me just as confident and trusting as\xe2\x80\x94as\xe2\x80\x94why Polly, I\r\nmust have _bought_ that confidence sometime or other a long time ago,\r\nand given my note, so to speak\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t get such things as a\r\n_gift_\xe2\x80\x94and how am I going to go back on a debt like that? And you see,\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re so poor, and old, and friendless, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 But I was ashamed by\r\nthat time, and shut him off, and somehow felt a new courage in me, and\r\nso I said, softly, \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll keep them\xe2\x80\x94the Lord will provide.\xe2\x80\x99 He was\r\nglad, and started to blurt out one of those over-confident speeches of\r\nhis, but checked himself in time, and said humbly, \xe2\x80\x98_I_ will, anyway.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nIt was years and years and years ago. Well, you see those old wrecks\r\nare here yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t they do your housework?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws! The idea. They would if they could, poor old things, and perhaps\r\nthey think they _do_ do some of it. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a superstition. Dan\xe2\x80\x99l\r\nwaits on the front door, and sometimes goes on an errand; and sometimes\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll see one or both of them letting on to dust around in here\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s because there\xe2\x80\x99s something they want to hear about and mix their\r\ngabble into. And they\xe2\x80\x99re always around at meals, for the same reason.\r\nBut the fact is, we have to keep a young negro girl just to take care\r\nof _them_, and a negro woman to do the housework and _help_ take care\r\nof them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they ought to be tolerably happy, I should think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no name for it. They quarrel together pretty much all the\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94most always about religion, because Dan\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99s a Dunker Baptist and\r\nJinny\xe2\x80\x99s a shouting Methodist, and Jinny believes in special Providences\r\nand Dan\xe2\x80\x99l don\xe2\x80\x99t, because he thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of a free-thinker\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthey play and sing plantation hymns together, and talk and chatter just\r\neternally and forever, and are sincerely fond of each other and think\r\nthe world of Mulberry, and he puts up patiently with all their spoiled\r\nways and foolishness, and so\xe2\x80\x94ah, well, they\xe2\x80\x99re happy enough if it comes\r\nto that. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve got used to it. I can get used to\r\nanything, with Mulberry to help; and the fact is, I don\xe2\x80\x99t much care\r\nwhat happens, so long as he\xe2\x80\x99s spared to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, here\xe2\x80\x99s to him, and hoping he\xe2\x80\x99ll make another strike soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd rake in the lame, the halt and the blind, and turn the house into\r\na hospital again? It\xe2\x80\x99s what he would do. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen aplenty of that and\r\nmore. No, Washington, I want his strikes to be mighty moderate ones the\r\nrest of the way down the vale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, big strike or little strike, or no strike at all, here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhoping he\xe2\x80\x99ll never lack for friends\xe2\x80\x94and I don\xe2\x80\x99t reckon he ever will\r\nwhile there\xe2\x80\x99s people around who know enough to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHim lack for friends!\xe2\x80\x9d and she tilted her head up with a frank\r\npride\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhy, Washington, you can\xe2\x80\x99t name a man that\xe2\x80\x99s anybody that isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfond of him. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you privately, that I\xe2\x80\x99ve had Satan\xe2\x80\x99s own time to\r\nkeep them from appointing him to some office or other. They knew he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nno business with an office, just as well as I did, but he\xe2\x80\x99s the hardest\r\nman to refuse anything to a body ever saw. Mulberry Sellers with an\r\noffice! laws goodness, you know what that would be like. Why, they\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ncome from the ends of the earth to see a circus like that. I\xe2\x80\x99d just as\r\nlieves be married to Niagara Falls, and done with it.\xe2\x80\x9d After a\r\nreflective pause she added\xe2\x80\x94having wandered back, in the interval, to\r\nthe remark that had been her text: \xe2\x80\x9cFriends?\xe2\x80\x94oh, indeed, no man ever\r\nhad more; and _such_ friends: Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, Johnston,\r\nLongstreet, Lee\xe2\x80\x94many\xe2\x80\x99s the time they\xe2\x80\x99ve sat in that chair you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nsitting in\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Hawkins was out of it instantly, and contemplating it with\r\na reverential surprise, and with the awed sense of having trodden shod\r\nupon holy ground\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_They!_\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, indeed, yes, a many and a many a time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe continued to gaze at the chair fascinated, magnetized; and for once\r\nin his life that continental stretch of dry prairie which stood for his\r\nimagination was afire, and across it was marching a slanting flamefront\r\nthat joined its wide horizons together and smothered the skies with\r\nsmoke. He was experiencing what one or another drowsing, geographically\r\nignorant alien experiences every day in the year when he turns a dull\r\nand indifferent eye out of the car window and it falls upon a certain\r\nstation-sign which reads \xe2\x80\x9cStratford-on-Avon!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Sellers went\r\ngossiping comfortably along:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, they like to hear him talk, especially if their load is getting\r\nrather heavy on one shoulder and they want to shift it. He\xe2\x80\x99s all air,\r\nyou know,\xe2\x80\x94breeze, you may say\xe2\x80\x94and he freshens them up; it\xe2\x80\x99s a trip to\r\nthe country, they say. Many a time he\xe2\x80\x99s made General Grant laugh\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s a tidy job, I can tell you, and as for Sheridan, his eye lights\r\nup and he listens to Mulberry Sellers the same as if he was artillery.\r\nYou see, the charm about Mulberry is, he is so catholic and\r\nunprejudiced that he fits in anywhere and everywhere. It makes him\r\npowerful good company, and as popular as scandal. You go to the White\r\nHouse when the President\xe2\x80\x99s holding a general reception\xe2\x80\x94sometime when\r\nMulberry\xe2\x80\x99s there. Why, dear me, _you_ can\xe2\x80\x99t tell which of them it is\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s holding that reception.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he certainly is a remarkable man\xe2\x80\x94and he always was. Is he\r\nreligious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClear to his marrow\xe2\x80\x94does more thinking and reading on that subject\r\nthan any other except Russia and Siberia: thrashes around over the\r\nwhole field, too; nothing bigoted about him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is his religion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped, and was lost for a moment or two in thinking, then\r\nshe said, with simplicity, \xe2\x80\x9cI think he was a Mohammedan or something\r\nlast week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWashington started down town, now, to bring his trunk, for the\r\nhospitable Sellerses would listen to no excuses; their house must be\r\nhis home during the session. The Colonel returned presently and resumed\r\nwork upon his plaything. It was finished when Washington got back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel, \xe2\x80\x9call finished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it for, Colonel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a trifle. Toy to amuse the children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWashington examined it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to be a puzzle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is. I call it Pigs in the Clover. Put them in\xe2\x80\x94see\r\nif you can put them in the pen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter many failures Washington succeeded, and was as pleased as a\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s wonderfully ingenious, Colonel, it\xe2\x80\x99s ever so clever and\r\ninteresting\xe2\x80\x94why, I could play with it all day. What are you going to do\r\nwith it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing. Patent it and throw it aside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you do anything of the kind. There\xe2\x80\x99s money in that thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA compassionate look traveled over the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s countenance, and he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoney\xe2\x80\x94yes; pin money: a couple of hundred thousand, perhaps. Not\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWashington\xe2\x80\x99s eyes blazed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA couple of hundred thousand dollars! do you call that pin money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe colonel rose and tip-toed his way across the room, closed a door\r\nthat was slightly ajar, tip-toed his way to his seat again, and said,\r\nunder his breath:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can keep a secret?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWashington nodded his affirmative, he was too awed to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have heard of materialization\xe2\x80\x94materialization of departed\r\nspirits?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWashington had heard of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in it; and quite right, too. The thing as\r\npractised by ignorant charlatans is unworthy of attention or\r\nrespect\xe2\x80\x94where there\xe2\x80\x99s a dim light and a dark cabinet, and a parcel of\r\nsentimental gulls gathered together, with their faith and their\r\nshudders and their tears all ready, and one and the same fatty\r\ndegeneration of protoplasm and humbug comes out and materializes\r\nhimself into anybody you want, grandmother, grandchild, brother-in-law,\r\nWitch of Endor, John Milton, Siamese twins, Peter the Great, and all\r\nsuch frantic nonsense\xe2\x80\x94no, that is all foolish and pitiful. But when a\r\nman that is competent brings the vast powers of _science_ to bear, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na different matter, a totally different matter, you see. The spectre\r\nthat answers _that_ call has come to stay. Do you note the commercial\r\nvalue of that detail?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x94the\xe2\x80\x94the truth is, that I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite know that I do. Do you\r\nmean that such, being permanent, not transitory, would give more\r\ngeneral satisfaction, and so enhance the price\xe2\x80\x94of tickets to the show\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow? Folly\xe2\x80\x94listen to me; and get a good grip on your breath, for you\r\nare going to need it. Within three days I shall have completed my\r\nmethod, and then\xe2\x80\x94let the world stand aghast, for it shall see marvels.\r\nWashington, within three days\xe2\x80\x94ten at the outside\xe2\x80\x94you shall see me call\r\nthe dead of any century, and they will arise and walk. Walk?\xe2\x80\x94they shall\r\nwalk forever, and never die again. Walk with all the muscle and spring\r\nof their pristine vigor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cColonel! Indeed it does take one\xe2\x80\x99s breath away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Now_ do you see the money that\xe2\x80\x99s in it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94well, I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94not really sure that I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Scott, look here. I shall have a monopoly; they\xe2\x80\x99ll all belong to\r\nme, won\xe2\x80\x99t they? Two thousand policemen in the city of New York. Wages,\r\nfour dollars a day. I\xe2\x80\x99ll replace them with dead ones at half the\r\nmoney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, prodigious! I never thought of that. F-o-u-r thousand dollars a\r\nday. Now I do begin to see! But will dead policemen answer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t they\xe2\x80\x94up to this time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you put it that way\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut it any way you want to. Modify it to suit yourself, and my lads\r\nshall still be superior. They won\xe2\x80\x99t eat, they won\xe2\x80\x99t drink\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t need\r\nthose things; they won\xe2\x80\x99t wink for cash at gambling dens and unlicensed\r\nrum-holes, they won\xe2\x80\x99t spark the scullery maids; and moreover the bands\r\nof toughs that ambuscade them on lonely beats, and cowardly shoot and\r\nknife them will only damage the uniforms and not live long enough to\r\nget more than a momentary satisfaction out of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Colonel, if you can furnish policemen, then of course\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly\xe2\x80\x94I can furnish any line of goods that\xe2\x80\x99s wanted. Take the\r\narmy, for instance\xe2\x80\x94now twenty-five thousand men; expense, twenty-two\r\nmillions a year. I will dig up the Romans, I will resurrect the Greeks,\r\nI will furnish the government, for ten millions a year, ten thousand\r\nveterans drawn from the victorious legions of all the ages\xe2\x80\x94soldiers\r\nthat will chase Indians year in and year out on materialized horses,\r\nand cost never a cent for rations or repairs. The armies of Europe cost\r\ntwo billions a year now\xe2\x80\x94I will replace them all for a billion. I will\r\ndig up the trained statesmen of all ages and all climes, and furnish\r\nthis country with a Congress that knows enough to come in out of the\r\nrain\xe2\x80\x94a thing that\xe2\x80\x99s never happened yet, since the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and never will happen till these practically dead people\r\nare replaced with the genuine article. I will restock the thrones of\r\nEurope with the best brains and the best morals that all the royal\r\nsepulchres of all the centuries can furnish\xe2\x80\x94which isn\xe2\x80\x99t promising very\r\nmuch\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99ll divide the wages and the civil list, fair and square,\r\nmerely taking my half and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cColonel, if the half of this is true, there\xe2\x80\x99s millions in\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94millions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBillions in it\xe2\x80\x94billions; that\xe2\x80\x99s what you mean. Why, look here; the\r\nthing is so close at hand, so imminent, so absolutely immediate, that\r\nif a man were to come to me now and say, Colonel, I am a little short,\r\nand if you could lend me a couple of billion dollars for\xe2\x80\x94come in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis in answer to a knock. An energetic looking man bustled in with a\r\nbig pocket-book in his hand, took a paper from it and presented it,\r\nwith the curt remark:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeventeenth and last call\xe2\x80\x94you want to out with that three dollars and\r\nforty cents this time without fail, Colonel Mulberry Sellers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Colonel began to slap this pocket and that one, and feel here and\r\nthere and everywhere, muttering:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _have_ I done with that wallet?\xe2\x80\x94let me see\xe2\x80\x94um\xe2\x80\x94not here, not there\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Oh, I must have left it in the kitchen; I\xe2\x80\x99ll just run and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo you won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll stay right where you are. And you\xe2\x80\x99re going to\r\ndisgorge, too\xe2\x80\x94this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWashington innocently offered to go and look. When he was gone the\r\nColonel said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to throw myself on your indulgence just this\r\nonce more, Suggs; you see the remittances I was expecting\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang the remittances\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s too stale\xe2\x80\x94it won\xe2\x80\x99t answer. Come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Colonel glanced about him in despair. Then his face lighted; he ran\r\nto the wall and began to dust off a peculiarly atrocious chromo with\r\nhis handkerchief. Then he brought it reverently, offered it to the\r\ncollector, averted his face and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it, but don\xe2\x80\x99t let me see it go. It\xe2\x80\x99s the sole remaining Rembrandt\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRembrandt be damned, it\xe2\x80\x99s a chromo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of it so, I beg you. It\xe2\x80\x99s the only really great\r\noriginal, the only supreme example of that mighty school of art which\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArt! It\xe2\x80\x99s the sickest looking thing I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe colonel was already bringing another horror and tenderly dusting\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake this one too\xe2\x80\x94the gem of my collection\xe2\x80\x94the only genuine Fra\r\nAngelico that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIlluminated liver-pad, that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is. Give it here\xe2\x80\x94good day\xe2\x80\x94people\r\nwill think I\xe2\x80\x99ve robbed a\xe2\x80\x99 nigger barber-shop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he slammed the door behind him the Colonel shouted with an anguished\r\naccent\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo please cover them up\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t let the damp get at them. The delicate\r\ntints in the Angelico\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the man was gone.\r\n\r\nWashington re-appeared and said he had looked everywhere, and so had\r\nMrs. Sellers and the servants, but in vain; and went on to say he\r\nwished he could get his eye on a certain man about this time\xe2\x80\x94no need to\r\nhunt up that pocket-book then. The Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s interest was awake at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne-armed Pete they call him out there\xe2\x80\x94out in the Cherokee country I\r\nmean. Robbed the bank in Tahlequah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo they have banks in Tahlequah?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94_a_ bank, anyway. He was suspected of robbing it. Whoever did it\r\ngot away with more than twenty thousand dollars. They offered a reward\r\nof five thousand. I believe I saw that very man, on my way east.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94is that so?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly saw a man on the train, the first day I struck the\r\nrailroad, that answered the description pretty exactly\xe2\x80\x94at least as to\r\nclothes and a lacking arm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy din\xe2\x80\x99t you get him arrested and claim the reward?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. I had to get a requisition, of course. But I meant to stay\r\nby him till I got my chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he left the train during the night some time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hang it, that\xe2\x80\x99s too bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so very bad, either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he came down to Baltimore in the very train I was in, though I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know it in time. As we moved out of the station I saw him going\r\ntoward the iron gate with a satchel in his hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood; we\xe2\x80\x99ll catch him. Let\xe2\x80\x99s lay a plan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend description to the Baltimore police?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what are you talking about? No. Do you want them to get the\r\nreward?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall we do, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Colonel reflected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. Put a personal in the Baltimore _Sun_. Word it like\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA. DROP ME A LINE, PETE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on. Which arm has he lost?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. Now then\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA. DROP ME A LINE, PETE, EVEN IF YOU HAVE to write with your left\r\nhand. Address X. Y. Z., General Postoffice, Washington. From YOU KNOW\r\nWHO.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he _won\xe2\x80\x99t_ know who\xe2\x80\x94will he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll want to know, won\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, certainly\xe2\x80\x94I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think of that. What made you think of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnowledge of human curiosity. Strong trait, very strong trait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to my room and write it out and enclose a dollar and tell\r\nthem to print it to the worth of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\np051.jpg (17K)\r\n\r\nThe day wore itself out. After dinner the two friends put in a long and\r\nharassing evening trying to decide what to do with the five thousand\r\ndollars reward which they were going to get when they should find\r\nOne-Armed Pete, and catch him, and prove him to be the right person,\r\nand extradite him, and ship him to Tahlequah in the Indian Territory.\r\nBut there were so many dazzling openings for ready cash that they found\r\nit impossible to make up their minds and keep them made up. Finally,\r\nMrs. Sellers grew very weary of it all, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the sense in cooking a rabbit before it\xe2\x80\x99s caught?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the matter was dropped, for the time being, and all went to bed.\r\nNext morning, being persuaded by Hawkins, the colonel made drawings and\r\nspecifications and went down and applied for a patent for his toy\r\npuzzle, and Hawkins took the toy itself and started out to see what\r\nchance there might be to do something with it commercially. He did not\r\nhave to go far. In a small old wooden shanty which had once been\r\noccupied as a dwelling by some humble negro family he found a keen-eyed\r\nYankee engaged in repairing cheap chairs and other second-hand\r\nfurniture. This man examined the toy indifferently; attempted to do the\r\npuzzle; found it not so easy as he had expected; grew more interested,\r\nand finally emphatically so; achieved a success at last, and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it patented?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatent applied for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will answer. What do you want for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will it retail for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, twenty-five cents, I should think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you give for the exclusive right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give twenty dollars, if I had to pay cash down; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntell you what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make it and market it, and pay you five\r\ncents royalty on each one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWashington sighed. Another dream disappeared; no money in the thing. So\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, take it at that. Draw me a paper.\xe2\x80\x9d He went his way with the\r\npaper, and dropped the matter out of his mind dropped it out to make\r\nroom for further attempts to think out the most promising way to invest\r\nhis half of the reward, in case a partnership investment satisfactory\r\nto both beneficiaries could not be hit upon.\r\n\r\nHe had not been very long at home when Sellers arrived sodden with\r\ngrief and booming with glad excitement\xe2\x80\x94working both these emotions\r\nsuccessfully, sometimes separately, sometimes together. He fell on\r\nHawkins\xe2\x80\x99s neck sobbing, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, mourn with me my friend, mourn for my desolate house: death has\r\nsmitten my last kinsman and I am Earl of Rossmore\xe2\x80\x94congratulate me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned to his wife, who had entered while this was going on, put his\r\narms about her and said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou will bear up, for my sake, my lady\xe2\x80\x94it had\r\nto happen, it was decreed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bore up very well, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no great loss. Simon Lathers was a poor well-meaning useless\r\nthing and no account, and his brother never was worth shucks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rightful earl continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am too much prostrated by these conflicting griefs and joys to be\r\nable to concentrate my mind upon affairs; I will ask our good friend\r\nhere to break the news by wire or post to the Lady Gwendolen and\r\ninstruct her to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_What_ Lady Gwendolen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur poor daughter, who, alas!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSally Sellers? Mulberry Sellers, are you losing your mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x94please do not forget who you are, and who I am; remember your\r\nown dignity, be considerate also of mine. It were best to cease from\r\nusing my family name, now, Lady Rossmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness gracious, well, I never! What _am_ I to call you then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn private, the ordinary terms of endearment will still be admissible,\r\nto some degree; but in public it will be more becoming if your ladyship\r\nwill speak _to_ me as my lord, or your lordship, and _of_ me as\r\nRossmore, or the Earl, or his Lordship, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, scat! I can\xe2\x80\x99t ever do it, Berry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut indeed you must, my love\xe2\x80\x94we must live up to our altered position\r\nand submit with what grace we may to its requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, all right, have it your own way; I\xe2\x80\x99ve never set my wishes\r\nagainst your commands yet, Mul\xe2\x80\x94my lord, and it\xe2\x80\x99s late to begin now,\r\nthough to my mind it\xe2\x80\x99s the rottenest foolishness that ever was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpoken like my own true wife! There, kiss and be friends again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94Gwendolen! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I am ever going to stand that name.\r\nWhy, a body wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t _know_ Sally Sellers in it. It\xe2\x80\x99s too large for\r\nher; kind of like a cherub in an ulster, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a most outlandish\r\nsort of a name, anyway, to my mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll not hear her find fault with it, my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a true word. She takes to any kind of romantic rubbish like she\r\nwas born to it. She never got it from me, that\xe2\x80\x99s sure. And sending her\r\nto that silly college hasn\xe2\x80\x99t helped the matter any\xe2\x80\x94just the other way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow hear her, Hawkins! Rowena-Ivanhoe College is the selectest and\r\nmost aristocratic seat of learning for young ladies in our country.\r\nUnder no circumstances can a girl get in there unless she is either\r\nvery rich and fashionable or can prove four generations of what may be\r\ncalled American nobility. Castellated college-buildings\xe2\x80\x94towers and\r\nturrets and an imitation moat\xe2\x80\x94and everything about the place named out\r\nof Sir Walter Scott\xe2\x80\x99s books and redolent of royalty and state and\r\nstyle; and all the richest girls keep phaetons, and coachmen in livery,\r\nand riding-horses, with English grooms in plug hats and tight-buttoned\r\ncoats, and top-boots, and a whip-handle without any whip to it, to ride\r\nsixty-three feet behind them\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they don\xe2\x80\x99t learn a blessed thing, Washington Hawkins, not a single\r\nblessed thing but showy rubbish and un-american pretentiousness. But\r\nsend for the Lady Gwendolen\xe2\x80\x94do; for I reckon the peerage regulations\r\nrequire that she must come home and let on to go into seclusion and\r\nmourn for those Arkansas blatherskites she\xe2\x80\x99s lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling! Blatherskites? Remember\xe2\x80\x94_noblesse oblige_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there\xe2\x80\x94talk to me in your own tongue, Ross\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t know any\r\nother, and you only botch it when you try. Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t stare\xe2\x80\x94it was a\r\nslip, and no crime; customs of a life-time can\xe2\x80\x99t be dropped in a\r\nsecond. Ross_more_\xe2\x80\x94there, now, be appeased, and go along with you and\r\nattend to Gwendolen. Are you going to write, Washington?\xe2\x80\x94or telegraph?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will telegraph, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought as much,\xe2\x80\x9d my lady muttered, as she left the room. \xe2\x80\x9cWants it\r\nso the address will have to appear on the envelop. It will just make a\r\nfool of that child. She\xe2\x80\x99ll get it, of course, for if there are any\r\nother Sellerses there they\xe2\x80\x99ll not be able to claim it. And just leave\r\nher alone to show it around and make the most of it. Well, maybe she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nforgivable for that. She\xe2\x80\x99s so poor and they\xe2\x80\x99re so rich, of course she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhad her share of snubs from the livery-flunkey sort, and I reckon it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonly human to want to get even.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUncle Dan\xe2\x80\x99l was sent with the telegram; for although a conspicuous\r\nobject in a corner of the drawing-room was a telephone hanging on a\r\ntransmitter, Washington found all attempts to raise the central office\r\nvain. The Colonel grumbled something about its being \xe2\x80\x9c_always_ out of\r\norder when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got particular and especial use for it,\xe2\x80\x9d but he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t explain that one of the reasons for this was that the thing was\r\nonly a dummy and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t any wire attached to it. And yet the Colonel\r\noften used it\xe2\x80\x94when visitors were present\xe2\x80\x94and seemed to get messages\r\nthrough it. Mourning paper and a seal were ordered, then the friends\r\ntook a rest.\r\n\r\nNext afternoon, while Hawkins, by request, draped Andrew Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nportrait with crape, the rightful earl, wrote off the family\r\nbereavement to the usurper in England\xe2\x80\x94a letter which we have already\r\nread. He also, by letter to the village authorities at Duffy\xe2\x80\x99s Corners,\r\nArkansas, gave order that the remains of the late twins be embalmed by\r\nsome St. Louis expert and shipped at once to the usurper\xe2\x80\x94with bill.\r\nThen he drafted out the Rossmore arms and motto on a great sheet of\r\nbrown paper, and he and Hawkins took it to Hawkins\xe2\x80\x99s Yankee\r\nfurniture-mender and at the end of an hour came back with a couple of\r\nstunning hatchments, which they nailed up on the front of the\r\nhouse\xe2\x80\x94attractions calculated to draw, and they did; for it was mainly\r\nan idle and shiftless negro neighborhood, with plenty of ragged\r\nchildren and indolent dogs to spare for a point of interest like that,\r\nand keep on sparing them for it, days and days together.\r\n\r\nThe new earl found\xe2\x80\x94without surprise\xe2\x80\x94this society item in the evening\r\npaper, and cut it out and scrapbooked it:\r\n\r\nBy a recent bereavement our esteemed fellow citizen, Colonel Mulberry\r\nSellers, Perpetual Member-at-large of the Diplomatic Body, succeeds, as\r\nrightful lord, to the great earldom of Rossmore, third by order of\r\nprecedence in the earldoms of Great Britain, and will take early\r\nmeasures, by suit in the House of Lords, to wrest the title and estates\r\nfrom the present usurping holder of them. Until the season of mourning\r\nis past, the usual Thursday evening receptions at Rossmore Towers will\r\nbe discontinued.\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Rossmore\xe2\x80\x99s comment\xe2\x80\x94to herself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReceptions! People who don\xe2\x80\x99t rightly know him may think he is\r\ncommonplace, but to my mind he is one of the most unusual men I ever\r\nsaw. As for suddenness and capacity in imagining things, his beat don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexist, I reckon. As like as not it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have occurred to anybody\r\nelse to name this poor old rat-trap Rossmore Towers, but it just comes\r\nnatural to him. Well, no doubt it\xe2\x80\x99s a blessed thing to have an\r\nimagination that can always make you satisfied, no matter how you are\r\nfixed. Uncle Dave Hopkins used to always say, \xe2\x80\x98Turn me into John\r\nCalvin, and I want to know which place I\xe2\x80\x99m going to; turn me into\r\nMulberry Sellers and I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rightful earl\xe2\x80\x99s comment\xe2\x80\x94to himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful name, beautiful. Pity I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think of it before I\r\nwrote the usurper. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll be ready for him when he answers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo answer to that telegram; no arriving daughter. Yet nobody showed any\r\nuneasiness or seemed surprised; that is, nobody but Washington. After\r\nthree days of waiting, he asked Lady Rossmore what she supposed the\r\ntrouble was. She answered, tranquilly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s some notion of hers, you never can tell. She\xe2\x80\x99s a Sellers, all\r\nthrough\xe2\x80\x94at least in some of her ways; and a Sellers can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you\r\nbeforehand what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do, because he don\xe2\x80\x99t know himself till\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s done it. _She\xe2\x80\x99s_ all right; no occasion to worry about _her_. When\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s ready she\xe2\x80\x99ll come or she\xe2\x80\x99ll write, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell which, till\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt turned out to be a letter. It was handed in at that moment, and was\r\nreceived by the mother without trembling hands or feverish eagerness,\r\nor any other of the manifestations common in the case of long delayed\r\nanswers to imperative telegrams. She polished her glasses with\r\ntranquility and thoroughness, pleasantly gossiping along, the while,\r\nthen opened the letter and began to read aloud:\r\n\r\nKENILWORTH KEEP, REDGAUNTLET HALL,\r\nROWENA-IVANHOE COLLEGE, THURSDAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR PRECIOUS MAMMA ROSSMORE:\r\n\r\nOh, the joy of it!\xe2\x80\x94you can\xe2\x80\x99t think. They had always turned up their\r\nnoses at our pretentions, you know; and I had fought back as well as I\r\ncould by turning up mine at theirs. They always said it might be\r\nsomething great and fine to be the rightful Shadow of an earldom, but\r\nto merely be shadow _of_ a shadow, and two or three times removed at\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94pooh-pooh! And I always retorted that not to be able to show four\r\ngenerations of American-Colonial-Dutch\r\nPeddler-and-Salt-Cod-McAllister-Nobility might be endurable, but to\r\n_have_ to confess such an origin\xe2\x80\x94pfew-few! Well, the telegram, it was\r\njust a cyclone! The messenger came right into the great Rob Roy Hall of\r\nAudience, as excited as he could be, singing out, \xe2\x80\x9cDispatch for Lady\r\nGwendolen Sellers!\xe2\x80\x9d and you ought to have seen that simpering\r\nchattering assemblage of pinchbeck aristocrats, turn to stone! I was\r\noff in the corner, of course, by myself\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s where Cinderella belongs.\r\nI took the telegram and read it, and tried to faint\xe2\x80\x94and I could have\r\ndone it if I had had any preparation, but it was all so sudden, you\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94but no matter, I did the next best thing: I put my handkerchief to\r\nmy eyes and fled sobbing to my room, dropping the telegram as I\r\nstarted. I released one corner of my eye a moment\xe2\x80\x94just enough to see\r\nthe herd swarm for the telegram\xe2\x80\x94and then continued my broken-hearted\r\nflight just as happy as a bird.\r\n\r\nThen the visits of condolence began, and I had to accept the loan of\r\nMiss Augusta-Templeton-Ashmore Hamilton\xe2\x80\x99s quarters because the press\r\nwas so great and there isn\xe2\x80\x99t room for three and a cat in mine. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen holding a Lodge of Sorrow ever since and defending myself against\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to claim kin. And do you know, the very first girl to\r\nfetch her tears and sympathy to my market was that foolish Skimperton\r\ngirl who has always snubbed me so shamefully and claimed lordship and\r\nprecedence of the whole college because some ancestor of hers, some\r\ntime or other, was a McAllister. Why it was like the bottom bird in the\r\nmenagerie putting on airs because its head ancestor was a pterodactyl.\r\n\r\nBut the ger-reatest triumph of all was\xe2\x80\x94guess. But you\xe2\x80\x99ll never. This is\r\nit. That little fool and two others have always been fussing and\r\nfretting over which was entitled to precedence\xe2\x80\x94by rank, you know.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ve nearly starved themselves at it; for each claimed the right to\r\ntake precedence of all the college in leaving the table, and so neither\r\nof them ever finished her dinner, but broke off in the middle and tried\r\nto get out ahead of the others. Well, after my first day\xe2\x80\x99s grief and\r\nseclusion\xe2\x80\x94I was fixing up a mourning dress you see\xe2\x80\x94I appeared at the\r\npublic table again, and then\xe2\x80\x94what do you think? Those three fluffy\r\ngoslings sat there contentedly, and squared up the long famine\xe2\x80\x94lapped\r\nand lapped, munched and munched, ate and ate, till the gravy appeared\r\nin their eyes\xe2\x80\x94humbly waiting for the Lady Gwendolen to take precedence\r\nand move out first, you see!\r\n\r\nOh, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been having a darling good time. And do you know, not one\r\nof these collegians has had the cruelty to ask me how I came by my new\r\nname. With some, this is due to charity, but with the others it isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nThey refrain, not from native kindness but from educated discretion. I\r\neducated them.\r\n\r\nWell, as soon as I shall have settled up what\xe2\x80\x99s left of the old scores\r\nand snuffed up a few more of those pleasantly intoxicating clouds of\r\nincense, I shall pack and depart homeward. Tell papa I am as fond of\r\nhim as I am of my new name. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t put it stronger than that. What\r\nan inspiration it was! But inspirations come easy to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese, from your loving daughter,\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nHawkins reached for the letter and glanced over it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood hand,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand full of confidence and animation, and goes\r\nracing right along. She\xe2\x80\x99s bright\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s plain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, they\xe2\x80\x99re all bright\xe2\x80\x94the Sellerses. Anyway, they would be, if there\r\nwere any. Even those poor Latherses would have been bright if they had\r\nbeen Sellerses; I mean full blood. Of course they had a Sellers strain\r\nin them\xe2\x80\x94a big strain of it, too\xe2\x80\x94but being a Bland dollar don\xe2\x80\x99t make it\r\na _dollar_ just the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe seventh day after the date of the telegram Washington came dreaming\r\ndown to breakfast and was set wide awake by an electrical spasm of\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nHere was the most beautiful young creature he had ever seen in his\r\nlife. It was Sally Sellers Lady Gwendolen; she had come in the night.\r\nAnd it seemed to him that her clothes were the prettiest and the\r\ndaintiest he had ever looked upon, and the most exquisitely contrived\r\nand fashioned and combined, as to decorative trimmings, and fixings,\r\nand melting harmonies of color. It was only a morning dress, and\r\ninexpensive, but he confessed to himself, in the English common to\r\nCherokee Strip, that it was a \xe2\x80\x9ccorker.\xe2\x80\x9d And now, as he perceived, the\r\nreason why the Sellers household poverties and sterilities had been\r\nmade to blossom like the rose, and charm the eye and satisfy the\r\nspirit, stood explained; here was the magician; here in the midst of\r\nher works, and furnishing in her own person the proper accent and\r\nclimaxing finish of the whole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter, Major Hawkins\xe2\x80\x94come home to mourn; flown home at the call\r\nof affliction to help the authors of her being bear the burden of\r\nbereavement. She was very fond of the late earl\xe2\x80\x94idolized him, sir,\r\nidolized him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, father, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s right, I was thinking of another\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94of her mother\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ idolized that smoked haddock?\xe2\x80\x94that sentimental, spiritless\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking of myself! Poor noble fellow, we were inseparable com\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear the man! Mulberry Sel\xe2\x80\x94Mul\xe2\x80\x94Rossmore\xe2\x80\x94hang the troublesome name I\r\ncan never\xe2\x80\x94if I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard you say once, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard you say a thousand\r\ntimes that if that poor sheep\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking of\xe2\x80\x94of\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who I was thinking of, and it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any difference anyway; _some_body idolized him, I\r\nrecollect it as if it were yesterday; and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, I am going to shake hands with Major Hawkins, and let the\r\nintroduction work along and catch up at its leisure. I remember you\r\nvery well in deed, Major Hawkins, although I was a little child when I\r\nsaw you last; and I am very, very glad indeed to see you again and have\r\nyou in our house as one of us;\xe2\x80\x9d and beaming in his face she finished\r\nher cordial shake with the hope that he had not forgotten her.\r\n\r\n\r\np061.jpg (29K)\r\n\r\nHe was prodigiously pleased by her outspoken heartiness, and wanted to\r\nrepay her by assuring her that he remembered her, and not only that but\r\nbetter even than he remembered his own children, but the facts would\r\nnot quite warrant this; still, he stumbled through a tangled sentence\r\nwhich answered just as well, since the purport of it was an awkward and\r\nunintentional confession that her extraordinary beauty had so stupefied\r\nhim that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got back to his bearings, yet, and therefore\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be certain as to whether he remembered her at all or not. The\r\nspeech made him her friend; it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t well help it.\r\n\r\nIn truth the beauty of this fair creature was of a rare type, and may\r\nwell excuse a moment of our time spent in its consideration. It did not\r\nconsist in the _fact_ that she had eyes, nose, mouth, chin, hair, ears,\r\nit consisted in their arrangement. In true beauty, more depends upon\r\nright location and judicious distribution of feature than upon\r\nmultiplicity of them. So also as regards color. The very combination of\r\ncolors which in a volcanic irruption would add beauty to a landscape\r\nmight detach it from a girl. Such was Gwendolen Sellers.\r\n\r\nThe family circle being completed by Gwendolen\xe2\x80\x99s arrival, it was\r\ndecreed that the official mourning should now begin; that it should\r\nbegin at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock every evening, (the dinner hour,) and end with the\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a grand old line, major, a sublime old line, and deserves to be\r\nmourned for, almost royally; almost imperially, I may say. Er\xe2\x80\x94Lady\r\nGwendolen\xe2\x80\x94but she\xe2\x80\x99s gone; never mind; I wanted my Peerage; I\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch\r\nit myself, presently, and show you a thing or two that will give you a\r\nrealizing idea of what our house is. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been glancing through Burke,\r\nand I find that of William the Conqueror\xe2\x80\x99s sixty-four natural ch\xe2\x80\x94my\r\ndear, would you mind getting me that book? It\xe2\x80\x99s on the escritoire in\r\nour boudoir. Yes, as I was saying, there\xe2\x80\x99s only St. Albans, Buccleugh\r\nand Grafton ahead of us on the list\xe2\x80\x94all the rest of the British\r\nnobility are in procession behind us. Ah, thanks, my lady. Now then, we\r\nturn to William, and we find\xe2\x80\x94letter for XYZ? Oh, splendid\xe2\x80\x94when\xe2\x80\x99d you\r\nget it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLast night; but I was asleep before you came, you were out so late;\r\nand when I came to breakfast Miss Gwendolen\xe2\x80\x94well, she knocked\r\neverything out of me, you know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWonderful girl, wonderful; her great origin is detectable in her step,\r\nher carriage, her features\xe2\x80\x94but what does he _say?_ Come, this is\r\nexciting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t read it\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94Rossm\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Rossm\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM\xe2\x80\x99lord! Just cut it short like that. It\xe2\x80\x99s the English way. I\xe2\x80\x99ll open\r\nit. Ah, now let\xe2\x80\x99s see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA. TO YOU KNOW WHO. Think I know you. Wait ten days. Coming to\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe excitement died out of both men\xe2\x80\x99s faces. There was a brooding\r\nsilence for a while, then the younger one said with a sigh:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, _we_ can\xe2\x80\x99t wait ten days for the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94the man\xe2\x80\x99s unreasonable; we are down to the bed rock, financially\r\nspeaking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we could explain to him in some way, that we are so situated that\r\ntime is of the utmost importance to us\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s it\xe2\x80\x94and so if it would be as convenient for him to come\r\nat once it would be a great accommodation to us, and one which we\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x94which we\xe2\x80\x94wh\xe2\x80\x94well, which we should sincerely appreciate\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it\xe2\x80\x94and most gladly reciprocate\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch him. Worded right, if he\xe2\x80\x99s a _man_\xe2\x80\x94got any of\r\nthe _feelings_ of a man, _sympathies_ and all that, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be here\r\ninside of twenty-four hours. Pen and paper\xe2\x80\x94come, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get right at\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetween them they framed twenty-two different advertisements, but none\r\nwas satisfactory. A main fault in all of them was urgency. That feature\r\nwas very troublesome: if made prominent, it was calculated to excite\r\nPete\xe2\x80\x99s suspicion; if modified below the suspicion-point it was flat and\r\nmeaningless. Finally the Colonel resigned, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have noticed, in such literary experiences as I have had, that one\r\nof the most taking things to do is to conceal your meaning when you are\r\n_trying_ to conceal it. Whereas, if you go at literature with a free\r\nconscience and nothing to conceal, you can turn out a book, every time,\r\nthat the very elect can\xe2\x80\x99t understand. They all do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Hawkins resigned also, and the two agreed that they must manage to\r\nwait the ten days some how or other. Next, they caught a ray of cheer:\r\nsince they had something definite to go upon, now, they could probably\r\nborrow money on the reward\xe2\x80\x94enough, at any rate, to tide them over till\r\nthey got it; and meantime the materializing recipe would be perfected,\r\nand then good bye to trouble for good and all.\r\n\r\nThe next day, May the tenth, a couple of things happened\xe2\x80\x94among others.\r\nThe remains of the noble Arkansas twins left our shores for England,\r\nconsigned to Lord Rossmore, and Lord Rossmore\xe2\x80\x99s son, Kirkcudbright\r\nLlanover Marjoribanks Sellers Viscount Berkeley, sailed from Liverpool\r\nfor America to place the reversion of the earldom in the hands of the\r\nrightful peer, Mulberry Sellers, of Rossmore Towers in the District of\r\nColumbia, U. S. A.\r\n\r\nThese two impressive shipments would meet and part in mid-Atlantic,\r\nfive days later, and give no sign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of time the twins arrived and were delivered to their\r\ngreat kinsman. To try to describe the rage of that old man would profit\r\nnothing, the attempt would fall so far short of the purpose. However\r\nwhen he had worn himself out and got quiet again, he looked the matter\r\nover and decided that the twins had some moral rights, although they\r\nhad no legal ones; they were of his blood, and it could not be decorous\r\nto treat them as common clay. So he laid them with their majestic kin\r\nin the Cholmondeley church, with imposing state and ceremony, and added\r\nthe supreme touch by officiating as chief mourner himself. But he drew\r\nthe line at hatchments.\r\n\r\nOur friends in Washington watched the weary days go by, while they\r\nwaited for Pete and covered his name with reproaches because of his\r\ncalamitous procrastinations. Meantime, Sally Sellers, who was as\r\npractical and democratic as the Lady Gwendolen Sellers was romantic and\r\naristocratic, was leading a life of intense interest and activity and\r\ngetting the most she could out of her double personality. All day long\r\nin the privacy of her work-room, Sally Sellers earned bread for the\r\nSellers family; and all the evening Lady Gwendolen Sellers supported\r\nthe Rossmore dignity. All day she was American, practically, and proud\r\nof the work of her head and hands and its commercial result; all the\r\nevening she took holiday and dwelt in a rich shadow-land peopled with\r\ntitled and coroneted fictions. By day, to her, the place was a plain,\r\nunaffected, ramshackle old trap\xe2\x80\x94 just that, and nothing more; by night\r\nit was Rossmore Towers. At college she had learned a trade without\r\nknowing it. The girls had found out that she was the designer of her\r\nown gowns. She had no idle moments after that, and wanted none; for the\r\nexercise of an extraordinary gift is the supremest pleasure in life,\r\nand it was manifest that Sally Sellers possessed a gift of that sort in\r\nthe matter of costume-designing. Within three days after reaching home\r\nshe had hunted up some work; before Pete was yet due in Washington, and\r\nbefore the twins were fairly asleep in English soil, she was already\r\nnearly swamped with work, and the sacrificing of the family chromos for\r\ndebt had got an effective check.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a brick,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rossmore to the Major; \xe2\x80\x9cjust her father all over:\r\nprompt to labor with head or hands, and not ashamed of it; capable,\r\nalways capable, let the enterprise be what it may; successful by\r\nnature\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t know what defeat is; thus, intensely and practically\r\nAmerican by inhaled nationalism, and at the same time intensely and\r\naristocratically European by inherited nobility of blood. Just me,\r\nexactly: Mulberry Sellers in matter of finance and invention; after\r\noffice hours, what do you find? The same clothes, yes, but what\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nthem? Rossmore of the peerage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two friends had haunted the general post-office daily. At last they\r\nhad their reward. Toward evening on the 20th of May, they got a letter\r\nfor XYZ. It bore the Washington postmark; the note itself was not\r\ndated. It said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsh barrel back of lamp post Black horse Alley. If you are playing\r\nsquare go and set on it to-morrow morning 21st 10.22 not sooner not\r\nlater wait till I come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe friends cogitated over the note profoundly. Presently the earl\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you reckon he\xe2\x80\x99s afraid we are a sheriff with a requisition?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, m\xe2\x80\x99lord?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause that\xe2\x80\x99s no place for a seance. Nothing friendly, nothing\r\nsociable about it. And at the same time, a body that wanted to know who\r\nwas roosting on that ash-barrel without exposing himself by going near\r\nit, or seeming to be interested in it, could just stand on the street\r\ncorner and take a glance down the alley and satisfy himself, don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nsee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, his idea is plain, now. He seems to be a man that can\xe2\x80\x99t _be_\r\ncandid and straightforward. He acts as if he thought we\xe2\x80\x94shucks, I wish\r\nhe had come out like a man and told us what hotel he\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you\xe2\x80\x99ve struck it! you\xe2\x80\x99ve struck it sure, Washington; he has told\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he has; but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to. That alley is a lonesome little\r\npocket that runs along one side of the New Gadsby. That\xe2\x80\x99s his hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes\xe2\x80\x99 you think that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I just know it. He\xe2\x80\x99s got a room that\xe2\x80\x99s just across from that lamp\r\npost. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to sit there perfectly comfortable behind his shutters\r\nat 10.22 to-morrow, and when he sees us sitting on the ash-barrel,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll say to himself, \xe2\x80\x98I saw _one_ of those fellows on the train\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthen he\xe2\x80\x99ll pack his satchel in half a minute and ship for the ends of\r\nthe earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHawkins turned sick with disappointment:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear, it\xe2\x80\x99s all up, Colonel\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what he\xe2\x80\x99ll do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed he won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t he? Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause _you_ won\xe2\x80\x99t be holding the ash barrel down, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be me.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be coming in with an officer and a requisition in plain\r\nclothes\xe2\x80\x94the officer, I mean\xe2\x80\x94the minute you see him arrive and open up a\r\ntalk with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what a head you have got, Colonel Sellers! I never should have\r\nthought of that in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither would any earl of Rossmore, betwixt William\xe2\x80\x99s contribution and\r\nMulberry\xe2\x80\x94_as_ earl; but it\xe2\x80\x99s office hours, now, you see, and the earl\r\nin me sleeps. Come\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you his very room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey reached the neighborhood of the New Gadsby about nine in the\r\nevening, and passed down the alley to the lamp post.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you are,\xe2\x80\x9d said the colonel, triumphantly, with a wave of his\r\nhand which took in the whole side of the hotel. \xe2\x80\x9cThere it is\xe2\x80\x94what did I\r\ntell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but\xe2\x80\x94why, Colonel, it\xe2\x80\x99s six stories high. I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite make out\r\nwhich window you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the windows, all of them. Let him have his choice\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m indifferent,\r\nnow that I have located him. You go and stand on the corner and wait;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll prospect the hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe earl drifted here and there through the swarming lobby, and finally\r\ntook a waiting position in the neighborhood of the elevator. During an\r\nhour crowds went up and crowds came down; and all complete as to limbs;\r\nbut at last the watcher got a glimpse of a figure that was\r\nsatisfactory\xe2\x80\x94got a glimpse of the back of it, though he had missed his\r\nchance at the face through waning alertness. The glimpse revealed a\r\ncowboy hat, and below it a plaided sack of rather loud pattern, and an\r\nempty sleeve pinned up to the shoulder. Then the elevator snatched the\r\nvision aloft and the watcher fled away in joyful excitement, and\r\nrejoined the fellow-conspirator.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got him, Major\xe2\x80\x94got him sure! I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him\xe2\x80\x94seen him good; and I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care where or when that man approaches me backwards, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nrecognize him every time. We\xe2\x80\x99re all right. Now for the requisition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey got it, after the delays usual in such cases. By half past eleven\r\nthey were at home and happy, and went to bed full of dreams of the\r\nmorrow\xe2\x80\x99s great promise.\r\n\r\nAmong the elevator load which had the suspect for fellow-passenger was\r\na young kinsman of Mulberry Sellers, but Mulberry was not aware of it\r\nand didn\xe2\x80\x99t see him. It was Viscount Berkeley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nArrived in his room Lord Berkeley made preparations for that first and\r\nlast and all-the-time duty of the visiting Englishman\xe2\x80\x94the jotting down\r\nin his diary of his \xe2\x80\x9cimpressions\xe2\x80\x9d to date. His preparations consisted\r\nin ransacking his \xe2\x80\x9cbox\xe2\x80\x9d for a pen. There was a plenty of steel pens on\r\nhis table with the ink bottle, but he was English. The English people\r\nmanufacture steel pens for nineteen-twentieths of the globe, but they\r\nnever use any themselves. They use exclusively the pre-historic quill.\r\nMy lord not only found a quill pen, but the best one he had seen in\r\nseveral years\xe2\x80\x94and after writing diligently for some time, closed with\r\nthe following entry:\r\n\r\np071.jpg (18K)\r\n\r\nBUT IN ONE THING I HAVE MADE AN IMMENSE MISTAKE, I OUGHT TO HAVE\r\nSHUCKED MY TITLE AND CHANGED MY NAME BEFORE I STARTED.\r\n\r\nHe sat admiring that pen a while, and then went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll attempts to mingle with the common people and become permanently\r\none of them are going to fail, unless I can get rid of it, disappear\r\nfrom it, and re-appear with the solid protection of a new name. I am\r\nastonished and pained to see how eager the most of these Americans are\r\nto get acquainted with a lord, and how diligent they are in pushing\r\nattentions upon him. They lack English servility, it is true\xe2\x80\x94but they\r\ncould acquire it, with practice. My quality travels ahead of me in the\r\nmost mysterious way. I write my family name without additions, on the\r\nregister of this hotel, and imagine that I am going to pass for an\r\nobscure and unknown wanderer, but the clerk promptly calls out, \xe2\x80\x98Front!\r\nshow his lordship to four-eighty-two!\xe2\x80\x99 and before I can get to the lift\r\nthere is a reporter trying to interview me as they call it. This sort\r\nof thing shall cease at once. I will hunt up the American Claimant the\r\nfirst thing in the morning, accomplish my mission, then change my\r\nlodging and vanish from scrutiny under a fictitious name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nHe left his diary on the table, where it would be handy in case any new\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cimpressions\xe2\x80\x9d should wake him up in the night, then he went to bed and\r\npresently fell asleep. An hour or two passed, and then he came slowly\r\nto consciousness with a confusion of mysterious and augmenting sounds\r\nhammering at the gates of his brain for admission; the next moment he\r\nwas sharply awake, and those sounds burst with the rush and roar and\r\nboom of an undammed freshet into his ears. Banging and slamming of\r\nshutters; smashing of windows and the ringing clash of falling glass;\r\nclatter of flying feet along the halls; shrieks, supplications, dumb\r\nmoanings of despair, within, hoarse shouts of command outside;\r\ncracklings and snappings, and the windy roar of victorious flames!\r\n\r\nBang, bang, bang! on the door, and a cry:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurn out\xe2\x80\x94the house is on fire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cry passed on, and the banging. Lord Berkeley sprang out of bed and\r\nmoved with all possible speed toward the clothes-press in the darkness\r\nand the gathering smoke, but fell over a chair and lost his bearings.\r\nHe groped desperately about on his hands, and presently struck his head\r\nagainst the table and was deeply grateful, for it gave him his bearings\r\nagain, since it stood close by the door. He seized his most precious\r\npossession; his journaled Impressions of America, and darted from the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\r\np074.jpg (34K)\r\n\r\nHe ran down the deserted hall toward the red lamp which he knew\r\nindicated the place of a fire-escape. The door of the room beside it\r\nwas open. In the room the gas was burning full head; on a chair was a\r\npile of clothing. He ran to the window, could not get it up, but\r\nsmashed it with a chair, and stepped out on the landing of the\r\nfire-escape; below him was a crowd of men, with a sprinkling of women\r\nand youth, massed in a ruddy light. Must he go down in his spectral\r\nnight dress? No\xe2\x80\x94this side of the house was not yet on fire except at\r\nthe further end; he would snatch on those clothes. Which he did. They\r\nfitted well enough, though a trifle loosely, and they were just a shade\r\nloud as to pattern. Also as to hat\xe2\x80\x94which was of a new breed to him,\r\nBuffalo Bill not having been to England yet. One side of the coat went\r\non, but the other side refused; one of its sleeves was turned up and\r\nstitched to the shoulder. He started down without waiting to get it\r\nloose, made the trip successfully, and was promptly hustled outside the\r\nlimit-rope by the police.\r\n\r\nThe cowboy hat and the coat but half on made him too much of a centre\r\nof attraction for comfort, although nothing could be more profoundly\r\nrespectful, not to say deferential, than was the manner of the crowd\r\ntoward him. In his mind he framed a discouraged remark for early entry\r\nin his diary: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is of no use; they know a lord through any disguise,\r\nand show awe of him\xe2\x80\x94even something very like fear, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPresently one of the gaping and adoring half-circle of boys ventured a\r\ntimid question. My lord answered it. The boys glanced wonderingly at\r\neach other and from somewhere fell the comment:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_English_ cowboy! Well, if that ain\xe2\x80\x99t curious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother mental note to be preserved for the diary: \xe2\x80\x9cCowboy. Now what\r\nmight a cowboy be? Perhaps\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d But the viscount perceived that some more\r\nquestions were about to be asked; so he worked his way out of the\r\ncrowd, released the sleeve, put on the coat and wandered away to seek a\r\nhumble and obscure lodging. He found it and went to bed and was soon\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, he examined his clothes. They were rather assertive, it\r\nseemed to him, but they were new and clean, at any rate. There was\r\nconsiderable property in the pockets. Item, five one-hundred dollar\r\nbills. Item, near fifty dollars in small bills and silver. Plug of\r\ntobacco. Hymn-book, which refuses to open; found to contain whiskey.\r\nMemorandum book bearing no name. Scattering entries in it, recording in\r\na sprawling, ignorant hand, appointments, bets, horse-trades, and so\r\non, with people of strange, hyphenated name\xe2\x80\x94Six-Fingered Jake,\r\nYoung-Man-afraid-of-his-Shadow, and the like. No letters, no documents.\r\n\r\nThe young man muses\xe2\x80\x94maps out his course. His letter of credit is\r\nburned; he will borrow the small bills and the silver in these pockets,\r\napply part of it to advertising for the owner, and use the rest for\r\nsustenance while he seeks work. He sends out for the morning paper,\r\nnext, and proceeds to read about the fire. The biggest line in the\r\ndisplay-head announces his own death! The body of the account furnishes\r\nall the particulars; and tells how, with the inherited heroism of his\r\ncaste, he went on saving women and children until escape for himself\r\nwas impossible; then with the eyes of weeping multitudes upon him, he\r\nstood with folded arms and sternly awaited the approach of the\r\ndevouring fiend; \xe2\x80\x9cand so standing, amid a tossing sea of flame and\r\non-rushing billows of smoke, the noble young heir of the great house of\r\nRossmore was caught up in a whirlwind of fiery glory, and disappeared\r\nforever from the vision of men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe thing was so fine and generous and knightly that it brought the\r\nmoisture to his eyes. Presently he said to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat to do is as\r\nplain as day, now. My Lord Berkeley is dead\xe2\x80\x94let him stay so. Died\r\ncreditably, too; that will make the calamity the easier for my father.\r\nAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to report to the American Claimant, now. Yes, nothing\r\ncould be better than the way matters have turned out. I have only to\r\nfurnish myself with a new name, and take my new start in life totally\r\nuntrammeled. Now I breathe my first breath of real freedom; and how\r\nfresh and breezy and inspiring it is! At last I am a man! a man on\r\nequal terms with my neighbor; and by my manhood, and by it alone, I\r\nshall rise and be seen of the world, or I shall sink from sight and\r\ndeserve it. This _is_ the gladdest day, and the proudest, that ever\r\npoured it\xe2\x80\x99s sun upon my head!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless my soul, Hawkins!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe morning paper dropped from the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s nerveless-grasp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s gone!\xe2\x80\x94the bright, the young, the gifted, the noblest of his\r\nillustrious race\xe2\x80\x94gone! gone up in flames and unimaginable glory!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy precious, precious young kinsman\xe2\x80\x94Kirkcudbright Llanover\r\nMarjoribanks Sellers Viscount Berkeley, son and heir of usurping\r\nRossmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true\xe2\x80\x94too true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLast night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight here in Washington; where he arrived from England last night,\r\nthe papers say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHotel burned down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat hotel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe New Gadsby!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my goodness! And have we lost both of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth _who?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne-Arm Pete.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, great guns, I forgot all about him. Oh, I hope not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHope! Well, I should say! Oh, we _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ spare _him!_ We can better\r\nafford to lose a million viscounts than our only support and stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey searched the paper diligently, and were appalled to find that a\r\none-armed man had been seen flying along one of the halls of the hotel\r\nin his underclothing and apparently out of his head with fright, and as\r\nhe would listen to no one and persisted in making for a stairway which\r\nwould carry him to certain death, his case was given over as a hopeless\r\none.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Hawkins; \xe2\x80\x9cand he had friends so near. I wish we\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t come away from there\xe2\x80\x94maybe we could have saved him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe earl looked up and said calmly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis being dead doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. He was uncertain before. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got him\r\nsure, this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGot him? How?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will materialize him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRossmore, don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t trifle with me. Do you mean that? Can you do\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can do it, just as sure as you are sitting there. And I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me your hand, and let me have the comfort of shaking it. I was\r\nperishing, and you have put new life into me. Get at it, oh, get at it\r\nright away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will take a little time, Hawkins, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no hurry, none in the\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x94in the circumstances. And of course certain duties have devolved\r\nupon me now, which necessarily claim my first attention. This poor\r\nyoung nobleman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, I am sorry for my heartlessness, and you smitten with this\r\nnew family affliction. Of course you must materialize him first\xe2\x80\x94I quite\r\nunderstand that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94well, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t meaning just that, but,\xe2\x80\x94why, what am I thinking of!\r\nOf course I must materialize him. Oh, Hawkins, selfishness is the\r\nbottom trait in human nature; I was only thinking that now, with the\r\nusurper\xe2\x80\x99s heir out of the way. But you\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive that momentary\r\nweakness, and forget it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t ever remember it against me that\r\nMulberry Sellers was once mean enough to think the thought that I was\r\nthinking. I\xe2\x80\x99ll materialise him\xe2\x80\x94I will, on my honor\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99d do it were\r\nhe a thousand heirs jammed into one and stretching in a solid rank from\r\nhere to the stolen estates of Rossmore, and barring the road forever to\r\nthe rightful earl!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere spoke the real Sellers\xe2\x80\x94the other had a false ring, old friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHawkins, my boy, it just occurs to me\xe2\x80\x94a thing I keep forgetting to\r\nmention\xe2\x80\x94a matter that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be mighty careful about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must keep absolutely still about these materializations. Mind, not\r\na hint of them must escape\xe2\x80\x94not a hint. To say nothing of how my wife\r\nand daughter\xe2\x80\x94high-strung, sensitive organizations\xe2\x80\x94might feel about\r\nthem, the negroes wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay on the place a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s well you spoke, for I\xe2\x80\x99m not naturally\r\ndiscreet with my tongue when I\xe2\x80\x99m not warned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSellers reached out and touched a bell-button in the wall; set his eye\r\nupon the rear door and waited; touched it again and waited; and just as\r\nHawkins was remarking admiringly that the Colonel was the most\r\nprogressive and most alert man he had ever seen, in the matter of\r\nimpressing into his service every modern convenience the moment it was\r\ninvented, and always keeping breast to breast with the drum major in\r\nthe great work of material civilization, he forsook the button (which\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t any wire attached to it,) rang a vast dinner bell which stood on\r\nthe table, and remarked that he had tried that new-fangled dry battery,\r\nnow, to his entire satisfaction, and had got enough of it; and added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing would do Graham Bell but I must try it; said the mere _fact_\r\nof my trying it would secure public confidence, and get it a chance to\r\nshow what it could do. I _told_ him that in theory a dry battery was\r\njust a curled darling and no mistake, but when it come to _practice_,\r\nsho!\xe2\x80\x94and here\xe2\x80\x99s the result. Was I right? What should _you_ say,\r\nWashington Hawkins? You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen me try that button twice. Was I\r\nright?\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the idea. Did I know what I was talking about, or didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nI?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know how I feel about you, Colonel Sellers, and always have\r\nfelt. It seems to me that you always know everything about\r\n_every_thing. If that man had known you as I know you he would have\r\ntaken your judgment at the start, and dropped his dry battery where it\r\nwas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ring, Marse Sellers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Marse Sellers didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDen it was you, Marse Washington. I\xe2\x80\x99s heah, suh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Marse Washington, either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDe good lan\xe2\x80\x99! who did ring her, den?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord Rossmore rang it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old negro flung up his hands and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlame my skin if I hain\xe2\x80\x99t gone en forgit dat name agin! Come heah,\r\nJinny\xe2\x80\x94run heah, honey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJinny arrived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou take dish-yer order de lord gwine to give you I\xe2\x80\x99s gwine down\r\nsuller and study dat name tell I git it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take de order! Who\xe2\x80\x99s yo\xe2\x80\x99 nigger las\xe2\x80\x99 year? De bell rung for _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDat don\xe2\x80\x99t make no diffunce. When a bell ring for anybody, en old\r\nmarster tell me to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClear out, and settle it in the kitchen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe noise of the quarreling presently sank to a murmur in the distance,\r\nand the earl added: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a trouble with old house servants that were\r\nyour slaves once and have been your personal friends always.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and members of the family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMembers of the family is just what they become\xe2\x80\x94_the_ members of the\r\nfamily, in fact. And sometimes master and mistress of the household.\r\nThese two are mighty good and loving and faithful and honest, but hang\r\nit, they do just about as they please, they chip into a conversation\r\nwhenever they want to, and the plain fact is, they ought to be killed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a random remark, but it gave him an idea\xe2\x80\x94however, nothing could\r\nhappen without that result.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I wanted, Hawkins, was to send for the family and break the news\r\nto them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, never mind bothering with the servants, then. I will go and bring\r\nthem down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile he was gone, the earl worked his idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the materializing down to a\r\ncertainty, I will get Hawkins to kill them, and after that they will be\r\nunder better control. Without doubt a materialized negro could easily\r\nbe hypnotized into a state resembling silence. And this could be made\r\npermanent\xe2\x80\x94yes, and also modifiable, at will\xe2\x80\x94sometimes _very_ silent,\r\nsometimes turn on more talk, more action, more emotion, according to\r\nwhat you want. It\xe2\x80\x99s a prime good idea. Make it adjustable\xe2\x80\x94with a screw\r\nor something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two ladies entered, now, with Hawkins, and the two negroes\r\nfollowed, uninvited, and fell to brushing and dusting around, for they\r\nperceived that there was matter of interest to the fore, and were\r\nwilling to find out what it was.\r\n\r\nSellers broke the news with stateliness and ceremony, first warning the\r\nladies, with gentle art, that a pang of peculiar sharpness was about to\r\nbe inflicted upon their hearts\xe2\x80\x94hearts still sore from a like hurt,\r\nstill lamenting a like loss\xe2\x80\x94then he took the paper, and with trembling\r\nlips and with tears in his voice he gave them that heroic\r\ndeath-picture.\r\n\r\nThe result was a very genuine outbreak of sorrow and sympathy from all\r\nthe hearers. The elder lady cried, thinking how proud that\r\ngreat-hearted young hero\xe2\x80\x99s mother would be, if she were living, and how\r\nunappeasable her grief; and the two old servants cried with her, and\r\nspoke out their applauses and their pitying lamentations with the\r\neloquent sincerity and simplicity native to their race. Gwendolen was\r\ntouched, and the romantic side of her nature was strongly wrought upon.\r\nShe said that such a nature as that young man\xe2\x80\x99s was rarely and truly\r\nnoble, and nearly perfect; and that with nobility of birth added it was\r\nentirely perfect. For such a man she could endure all things, suffer\r\nall things, even to the sacrificing of her life. She wished she could\r\nhave seen him; the slightest, the most momentary contact with such a\r\nspirit would have ennobled her whole character and made ignoble\r\nthoughts and ignoble acts thereafter impossible to her forever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave they found the body, Rossmore?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is, they\xe2\x80\x99ve found several. It must be one of them, but none\r\nof them are recognizable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going down there and identify one of them and send it home to the\r\nstricken father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut papa, did you ever see the young man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Gwendolen-why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow will you identify it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94well, you know it says none of them are recognizable. I\xe2\x80\x99ll send his\r\nfather one of them\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s probably no choice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGwendolen knew it was not worth while to argue the matter further,\r\nsince her father\xe2\x80\x99s mind was made up and there was a chance for him to\r\nappear upon that sad scene down yonder in an authentic and official\r\nway. So she said no more\xe2\x80\x94till he asked for a basket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA basket, papa? What for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might be ashes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earl and Washington started on the sorrowful errand, talking as\r\nthey walked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as _usual!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Colonel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeven of them in that hotel. Actresses. And all burnt out, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny of them burnt _up?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no they escaped; they always do; but there\xe2\x80\x99s never a one of them\r\nthat knows enough to fetch out her jewelry with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s strange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s the most unaccountable thing in the world. Experience\r\nteaches them nothing; they can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to learn anything except out of a\r\nbook. In some cases there\xe2\x80\x99s manifestly a fatality about it. For\r\ninstance, take What\xe2\x80\x99s-her-name, that plays those sensational thunder\r\nand lightning parts. She\xe2\x80\x99s got a perfectly immense reputation\xe2\x80\x94draws\r\nlike a dog-fight\xe2\x80\x94and it all came from getting burnt out in hotels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, how could that give her a reputation as an actress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt didn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94it only made her name familiar. People want to see her play\r\nbecause her name is familiar, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t know what made it\r\nfamiliar, because they don\xe2\x80\x99t remember. First, she was at the bottom of\r\nthe ladder, and absolutely obscure\xe2\x80\x94wages thirteen dollars a week and\r\nfind her own pads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPads?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94things to fat up her spindles with so as to be plump and\r\nattractive. Well, she got burnt out in a hotel and lost $30,000 worth\r\nof diamonds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe? Where\xe2\x80\x99d she get them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness knows\xe2\x80\x94given to her, no doubt, by spoony young flats and sappy\r\nold bald-heads in the front row. All the papers were full of it. She\r\nstruck for higher pay and got it. Well, she got burnt out again and\r\nlost all her diamonds, and it gave her such a lift that she went\r\nstarring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if hotel fires are all she\xe2\x80\x99s got to depend on to keep up her\r\nname, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty precarious kind of a reputation I should think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot with her. No, anything but that. Because she\xe2\x80\x99s so lucky; born\r\nlucky, I reckon. Every time there\xe2\x80\x99s a hotel fire she\xe2\x80\x99s in it. She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nalways there\xe2\x80\x94and if she can\xe2\x80\x99t be there herself, her diamonds are. Now\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t make anything out of that but just sheer luck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never heard of such a thing. She must have lost quarts of diamonds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuarts, she\xe2\x80\x99s lost bushels of them. It\xe2\x80\x99s got so that the hotels are\r\nsuperstitious about her. They won\xe2\x80\x99t let her in. They think there will\r\nbe a fire; and besides, if she\xe2\x80\x99s there it cancels the insurance. She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen waning a little lately, but this fire will set her up. She lost\r\n$60,000 worth last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she\xe2\x80\x99s a fool. If I had $60,000 worth of diamonds I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntrust them in a hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t either; but you can\xe2\x80\x99t teach an actress that. This one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen burnt out thirty-five times. And yet if there\xe2\x80\x99s a hotel fire in\r\nSan Francisco to-night she\xe2\x80\x99s got to bleed again, you mark my words.\r\nPerfect ass; they say she\xe2\x80\x99s got diamonds in every hotel in the\r\ncountry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the scene of the fire the poor old earl took one\r\nglimpse at the melancholy morgue and turned away his face overcome by\r\nthe spectacle. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is too true, Hawkins\xe2\x80\x94recognition is impossible, not one of the five\r\ncould be identified by its nearest friend. You make the selection, I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich one had I better\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, take any of them. Pick out the best one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever, the officers assured the earl\xe2\x80\x94for they knew him, everybody in\r\nWashington knew him\xe2\x80\x94that the position in which these bodies were found\r\nmade it impossible that any one of them could be that of his noble\r\nyoung kinsman. They pointed out the spot where, if the newspaper\r\naccount was correct, he must have sunk down to destruction; and at a\r\nwide distance from this spot they showed him where the young man must\r\nhave gone down in case he was suffocated in his room; and they showed\r\nstill a third place, quite remote, where he might possibly have found\r\nhis death if perchance he tried to escape by the side exit toward the\r\nrear. The old Colonel brushed away a tear and said to Hawkins:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs it turns out there was something prophetic in my fears. Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nmatter of ashes. Will you kindly step to a grocery and fetch a couple\r\nmore baskets?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReverently they got a basket of ashes from each of those now hallowed\r\nspots, and carried them home to consult as to the best manner of\r\nforwarding them to England, and also to give them an opportunity to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clie in state,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a mark of respect which the colonel deemed obligatory,\r\nconsidering the high rank of the deceased.\r\n\r\nThey set the baskets on the table in what was formerly the library,\r\ndrawing-room and workshop\xe2\x80\x94now the Hall of Audience\xe2\x80\x94and went up stairs\r\nto the lumber room to see if they could find a British flag to use as a\r\npart of the outfit proper to the lying in state. A moment later, Lady\r\nRossmore came in from the street and caught sight of the baskets just\r\nas old Jinny crossed her field of vision. She quite lost her patience\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what will you do next? What in the world possessed you to\r\nclutter up the parlor table with these baskets of ashes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAshes?\xe2\x80\x9d And she came to look. She put up her hands in pathetic\r\nastonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I _never_ see de like!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho, me? Clah to goodness it\xe2\x80\x99s de fust time I\xe2\x80\x99ve sot eyes on \xe2\x80\x99em, Miss\r\nPolly. Dat\xe2\x80\x99s Dan\xe2\x80\x99l. Dat ole moke is losin\xe2\x80\x99 his mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\np088.jpg (16K)\r\n\r\nBut it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Dan\xe2\x80\x99l, for he was called, and denied it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDey ain\xe2\x80\x99t no way to \xe2\x80\x99splain dat. Wen hit\xe2\x80\x99s one er dese-yer common\r\n\xe2\x80\x99currences, a body kin reckon maybe de cat\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d and a shudder shook Lady Rossmore to her foundations. \xe2\x80\x9cI see it\r\nall. Keep away from them\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re _his_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_His_, m\xe2\x80\x99 lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94your young Marse Sellers from England that\xe2\x80\x99s burnt up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was alone with the ashes\xe2\x80\x94alone before she could take half a breath.\r\nThen she went after Mulberry Sellers, purposing to make short work of\r\nhis program, whatever it might be; \xe2\x80\x9cfor,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen his\r\nsentimentals are up, he\xe2\x80\x99s a numskull, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing what\r\nextravagance he\xe2\x80\x99ll contrive, if you let him alone.\xe2\x80\x9d She found him. He\r\nhad found the flag and was bringing it. When she heard that his idea\r\nwas to have the remains \xe2\x80\x9clie in state, and invite the government and\r\nthe public,\xe2\x80\x9d she broke it up. She said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour intentions are all right\xe2\x80\x94they always are\xe2\x80\x94you want to do honour to\r\nthe remains, and surely nobody can find any fault with that, for he was\r\nyour kin; but you are going the wrong way about it, and you will see it\r\nyourself if you stop and think. You can\xe2\x80\x99t file around a basket of ashes\r\ntrying to look sorry for it and make a sight that is really solemn,\r\nbecause the solemner it is, the more it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94anybody can see that. It\r\nwould be so with one basket; it would be three times so with three.\r\nWell, it stands to reason that if it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be solemn with one\r\nmourner, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be with a procession\xe2\x80\x94and there would be five\r\nthousand people here. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know but it would be pretty near\r\nridiculous; I think it would. No, Mulberry, they can\xe2\x80\x99t lie in state\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwould be a mistake. Give that up and think of something else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he gave it up; and not reluctantly, when he had thought it over and\r\nrealized how right her instinct was. He concluded to merely sit up with\r\nthe remains just himself and Hawkins. Even this seemed a doubtful\r\nattention, to his wife, but she offered no objection, for it was plain\r\nthat he had a quite honest and simple-hearted desire to do the friendly\r\nand honourable thing by these forlorn poor relics which could command\r\nno hospitality in this far off land of strangers but his. He draped the\r\nflag about the baskets, put some crape on the door-knob, and said with\r\nsatisfaction:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x94he is as comfortable, now, as we can make him in the\r\ncircumstances. Except\xe2\x80\x94yes, we must strain a point there\xe2\x80\x94one must do as\r\none would wish to be done by\xe2\x80\x94he must have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave what, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHatchment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wife felt that the house-front was standing about all it could well\r\nstand, in that way; the prospect of another stunning decoration of that\r\nnature distressed her, and she wished the thing had not occurred to\r\nhim. She said, hesitatingly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought such an honour as that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to any but very\r\n_very_ near relations, who\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight, you are quite right, my lady, perfectly right; but there aren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nany nearer relatives than relatives by usurpation. We cannot avoid it;\r\nwe are slaves of aristocratic custom and must submit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hatchments were unnecessarily generous, each being as large as a\r\nblanket, and they were unnecessarily volcanic, too, as to variety and\r\nviolence of color, but they pleased the earl\xe2\x80\x99s barbaric eye, and they\r\nsatisfied his taste for symmetry and completeness, too, for they left\r\nno waste room to speak of on the house-front.\r\n\r\nLady Rossmore and her daughter assisted at the sitting-up till near\r\nmidnight, and helped the gentlemen to consider what ought to be done\r\nnext with the remains. Rossmore thought they ought to be sent home with\r\na committee and resolutions,\xe2\x80\x94at once. But the wife was doubtful. She\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you send all of the baskets?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll at once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo his father? Oh, no\xe2\x80\x94by no means. Think of the shock. No\xe2\x80\x94one at a\r\ntime; break it to him by degrees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould _that_ have that effect, father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my daughter. Remember, you are young and elastic, but he is old.\r\nTo send him the whole at once might well be more than he could bear.\r\nBut mitigated\xe2\x80\x94one basket at a time, with restful intervals between, he\r\nwould be used to it by the time he got all of him. And sending him in\r\nthree ships is safer anyway. On account of wrecks and storms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like the idea, father. If I were his father it would be\r\ndreadful to have him coming in that\xe2\x80\x94in that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the installment plan,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Hawkins, gravely, and proud of\r\nbeing able to help.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94dreadful to have him coming in that incoherent way. There would be\r\nthe strain of suspense upon me all the time. To have so depressing a\r\nthing as a funeral impending, delayed, waiting, unaccomplished\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, my child,\xe2\x80\x9d said the earl reassuringly, \xe2\x80\x9cthere would be nothing\r\nof that kind; so old a gentleman could not endure a long-drawn suspense\r\nlike that. There will be three funerals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Rossmore looked up surprised, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is _that_ going to make it easier for him? It\xe2\x80\x99s a total mistake,\r\nto my mind. He ought to be buried all at once; I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think so, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hawkins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd certainly _I_ should,\xe2\x80\x9d said the daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are all wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said the earl. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will see it yourselves, if you\r\nthink. Only one of these baskets has got him in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Rossmore, \xe2\x80\x9cthe thing is perfectly\r\nsimple\xe2\x80\x94bury _that_ one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Gwendolen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is _not_ simple,\xe2\x80\x9d said the earl, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause we do not know which\r\nbasket he is in. We know he is in _one_ of them, but that is all we\r\n_do_ know. You see now, I reckon, that I was right; it takes three\r\nfunerals, there is no other way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd three graves and three monuments and three inscriptions?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nthe daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94to do it right. That is what I should do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt could not be done so, father. Each of the inscriptions would give\r\nthe same name and the same facts and say he was under each and all of\r\nthese monuments, and that would not answer at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe earl nestled uncomfortably in his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat _is_ an objection. That is a serious objection. I\r\nsee no way out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a general silence for a while. Then Hawkins said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me that if we mixed the three ramifications together\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe earl grasped him by the hand and shook it gratefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt solves the whole problem,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOne ship, one funeral, one\r\ngrave, one monument\xe2\x80\x94it is admirably conceived. It does you honor, Major\r\nHawkins, it has relieved me of a most painful embarrassment and\r\ndistress, and it will save that poor stricken old father much\r\nsuffering. Yes, he shall go over in one basket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow-immediately, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would wait, Mulberry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait? Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ don\xe2\x80\x99t want to break that childless old man\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod knows I don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen wait till he sends for his son\xe2\x80\x99s remains. If you do that, you\r\nwill never have to give him the last and sharpest pain a parent can\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94I mean, the _certainty_ that his son is dead. For he will never\r\nsend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy won\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause to send\xe2\x80\x94and find out the truth\xe2\x80\x94would rob him of the one\r\nprecious thing left him, the _uncertainty_, the dim hope that maybe,\r\nafter all, his boy escaped, and he will see him again some day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy Polly, he\xe2\x80\x99ll know by the _papers_ that he was burnt up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t let himself _believe_ the papers; he\xe2\x80\x99ll argue against\r\nanything and everything that proves his son is dead; and he will keep\r\nthat up and live on it, and on nothing else till he dies. But if the\r\n_remains_ should actually come, and be put before that poor old\r\ndim-hoping soul\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God, they never shall! Polly, you\xe2\x80\x99ve saved me from a crime, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll bless you for it always. _Now_ we know what to do. We\xe2\x80\x99ll place\r\nthem reverently away, and he shall never know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young Lord Berkeley, with the fresh air of freedom in his nostrils,\r\nwas feeling invincibly strong for his new career; and yet\xe2\x80\x94and yet\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nthe fight should prove a very hard one at first, very discouraging,\r\nvery taxing on untoughened moral sinews, he might in some weak moment\r\nwant to retreat. Not likely, of course, but possibly that might happen.\r\nAnd so on the whole it might be pardonable caution to burn his bridges\r\nbehind him. Oh, without doubt. He must not stop with advertising for\r\nthe owner of that money, but must put it where he could not borrow from\r\nit himself, meantime, under stress of circumstances. So he went down\r\ntown, and put in his advertisement, then went to a bank and handed in\r\n$500 for deposit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hesitated and colored a little; he had forgotten to make a\r\nselection. He now brought out the first one that suggested itself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoward Tracy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone the clerks, marveling, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cowboy blushed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe first step was accomplished. The money was still under his command\r\nand at his disposal, but the next step would dispose of that\r\ndifficulty. He went to another bank and drew upon the first bank for\r\nthe $500 by check. The money was collected and deposited a second time\r\nto the credit of Howard Tracy. He was asked to leave a few samples of\r\nhis signature, which he did. Then he went away, once more proud and of\r\nperfect courage, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo help for me now, for henceforth I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t draw that money without\r\nidentification, and that is become legally impossible. No resources to\r\nfall back on. It is work or starve from now to the end. I am ready\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nnot afraid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he sent this cablegram to his father:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEscaped unhurt from burning hotel. Have taken fictitious name.\r\nGoodbye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the evening while he was wandering about in one of the outlying\r\ndistricts of the city, he came across a small brick church, with a bill\r\nposted there with these words printed on it: \xe2\x80\x9cMECHANICS\xe2\x80\x99 CLUB DEBATE.\r\nALL INVITED.\xe2\x80\x9d He saw people, apparently mainly of the working class,\r\nentering the place, and he followed and took his seat. It was a humble\r\nlittle church, quite bare as to ornamentation. It had painted pews\r\nwithout cushions, and no pulpit, properly speaking, but it had a\r\nplatform. On the platform sat the chairman, and by his side sat a man\r\nwho held a manuscript in his hand and had the waiting look of one who\r\nis going to perform the principal part. The church was soon filled with\r\na quiet and orderly congregation of decently dressed and modest people.\r\nThis is what the chairman said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe essayist for this evening is an old member of our club whom you\r\nall know, Mr. Parker, assistant editor of the Daily Democrat. The\r\nsubject of his essay is the American Press, and he will use as his text\r\na couple of paragraphs taken from Mr. Matthew Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s new book. He\r\nasks me to read these texts for him. The first is as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Goethe says somewhere that \xe2\x80\x9cthe thrill of awe,\xe2\x80\x9d that is to say,\r\nREVERENCE, is the best thing humanity has.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s other paragraph is as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I should say that if one were searching for the best means to efface\r\nand kill in a whole nation the discipline of respect, one could not do\r\nbetter than take the American newspapers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\np095.jpg (18K)\r\n\r\nMr. Parker rose and bowed, and was received with warm applause. He then\r\nbegan to read in a good round resonant voice, with clear enunciation\r\nand careful attention to his pauses and emphases. His points were\r\nreceived with approval as he went on.\r\n\r\nThe essayist took the position that the most important function of a\r\npublic journal in any country was the propagating of national feeling\r\nand pride in the national name\xe2\x80\x94the keeping the people \xe2\x80\x9cin love with\r\n_their_ country and _its_ institutions, and shielded from the\r\nallurements of alien and inimical systems.\xe2\x80\x9d He sketched the manner in\r\nwhich the reverent Turkish or Russian journalist fulfilled this\r\nfunction\xe2\x80\x94the one assisted by the prevalent \xe2\x80\x9cdiscipline of respect\xe2\x80\x9d for\r\nthe bastinado, the other for Siberia. Continuing, he said:\r\n\r\nThe chief function of an English journal is that of all other journals\r\nthe world over: it must keep the public eye fixed admiringly upon\r\ncertain things, and keep it diligently diverted from certain others.\r\nFor instance, it must keep the public eye fixed admiringly upon the\r\nglories of England, a processional splendor stretching its receding\r\nline down the hazy vistas of time, with the mellowed lights of a\r\nthousand years glinting from its banners; and it must keep it\r\ndiligently diverted from the fact that all these glories were for the\r\nenrichment and aggrandizement of the petted and privileged few, at cost\r\nof the blood and sweat and poverty of the unconsidered masses who\r\nachieved them but might not enter in and partake of them. It must keep\r\nthe public eye fixed in loving and awful reverence upon the throne as a\r\nsacred thing, and diligently divert it from the fact that no throne was\r\never set up by the unhampered vote of a majority of any nation; and\r\nthat hence no throne exists that has a right to exist, and no symbol of\r\nit, flying from any flagstaff, is righteously entitled to wear any\r\ndevice but the skull and crossbones of that kindred industry which\r\ndiffers from royalty only business-wise\xe2\x80\x94merely as retail differs from\r\nwholesale. It must keep the citizen\xe2\x80\x99s eye fixed in reverent docility\r\nupon that curious invention of machine politics, an Established Church,\r\nand upon that bald contradiction of common justice, a hereditary\r\nnobility; and diligently divert it from the fact that the one damns him\r\nif he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t wear its collar, and robs him under the gentle name of\r\ntaxation whether he wears it or not, and the other gets all the honors\r\nwhile he does all the work.\r\n\r\nThe essayist thought that Mr. Arnold, with his trained eye and\r\nintelligent observation, ought to have perceived that the very quality\r\nwhich he so regretfully missed from our press\xe2\x80\x94respectfulness, reverence\r\n\xe2\x80\x94was exactly the thing which would make our press useless to us if it\r\nhad it\xe2\x80\x94rob it of the very thing which differentiates it from all other\r\njournalism in the world and makes it distinctively and preciously\r\nAmerican, its frank and cheerful irreverence being by all odds the most\r\nvaluable of all its qualities. \xe2\x80\x9cFor its mission\xe2\x80\x94overlooked by Mr.\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x94is to stand guard over a nation\xe2\x80\x99s liberties, not its humbugs and\r\nshams.\xe2\x80\x9d He thought that if during fifty years the institutions of the\r\nold world could be exposed to the fire of a flouting and scoffing press\r\nlike ours, \xe2\x80\x9cmonarchy and its attendant crimes would disappear from\r\nChristendom.\xe2\x80\x9d Monarchists might doubt this; then \xe2\x80\x9cwhy not persuade the\r\nCzar to give it a trial in Russia?\xe2\x80\x9d Concluding, he said:\r\n\r\nWell, the charge is, that our press has but little of that old world\r\nquality, reverence. Let us be candidly grateful that it is so. With its\r\nlimited reverence it at least reveres the things which this nation\r\nreveres, as a rule, and that is sufficient: what other people revere is\r\nfairly and properly matter of light importance to us. Our press does\r\nnot reverence kings, it does not reverence so called nobilities, it\r\ndoes not reverence established ecclesiastical slaveries, it does not\r\nreverence laws which rob a younger son to fatten an elder one, it does\r\nnot reverence any fraud or sham or infamy, howsoever old or rotten or\r\nholy, which sets one citizen above his neighbor by accident of birth:\r\nit does not reverence any law or custom, howsoever old or decayed or\r\nsacred, which shuts against the best man in the land the best place in\r\nthe land and the divine right to prove property and go up and occupy\r\nit. In the sense of the poet Goethe\xe2\x80\x94that meek idolater of provincial\r\nthree carat royalty and nobility\xe2\x80\x94our press is certainly bankrupt in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthrill of awe\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94otherwise reverence; reverence for nickel plate and\r\nbrummagem. Let us sincerely hope that this fact will remain a fact\r\nforever: for to my mind a discriminating irreverence is the creator and\r\nprotector of human liberty\xe2\x80\x94even as the other thing is the creator,\r\nnurse, and steadfast protector of all forms of human slavery, bodily\r\nand mental.\r\n\r\nTracy said to himself, almost shouted to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad I came to\r\nthis country. I was right. I was right to seek out a land where such\r\nhealthy principles and theories are in men\xe2\x80\x99s hearts and minds. Think of\r\nthe innumerable slaveries imposed by misplaced reverence! How well he\r\nbrought that out, and how true it is. There\xe2\x80\x99s manifestly prodigious\r\nforce in reverence. If you can get a man to reverence your ideals, he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyour slave. Oh, yes, in all the ages the peoples of Europe have been\r\ndiligently taught to avoid reasoning about the shams of monarchy and\r\nnobility, been taught to avoid examining them, been taught to reverence\r\nthem; and now, as a natural result, to reverence them is second nature.\r\nIn order to shock them it is sufficient to inject a thought of the\r\nopposite kind into their dull minds. For ages, any expression of\r\nso-called irreverence from their lips has been sin and crime. The sham\r\nand swindle of all this is apparent the moment one reflects that he is\r\nhimself the only legitimately qualified judge of what is entitled to\r\nreverence and what is not. Come, I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought of that before, but\r\nit is true, absolutely true. What right has Goethe, what right has\r\nArnold, what right has any dictionary, to define the word Irreverence\r\nfor me? What their ideals are is nothing to me. So long as I reverence\r\nmy own ideals my whole duty is done, and I commit no profanation if I\r\nlaugh at theirs. I may scoff at other people\xe2\x80\x99s ideals as much as I want\r\nto. It is my right and my privilege. No man has any right to deny it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy was expecting to hear the essay debated, but this did not happen.\r\nThe chairman said, by way of explanation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would say, for the information of the strangers present here, that\r\nin accordance with our custom the subject of this meeting will be\r\ndebated at the next meeting of the club. This is in order to enable our\r\nmembers to prepare what they may wish to say upon the subject with pen\r\nand paper, for we are mainly mechanics and unaccustomed to speaking. We\r\nare obliged to write down what we desire to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMany brief papers were now read, and several offhand speeches made in\r\ndiscussion of the essay read at the last meeting of the club, which had\r\nbeen a laudation, by some visiting professor, of college culture, and\r\nthe grand results flowing from it to the nation. One of the papers was\r\nread by a man approaching middle age, who said he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had a college\r\neducation, that he had got his education in a printing office, and had\r\ngraduated from there into the patent office, where he had been a clerk\r\nnow for a great many years. Then he continued to this effect:\r\n\r\nThe essayist contrasted the America of to-day with the America of\r\nbygone times, and certainly the result is the exhibition of a mighty\r\nprogress. But I think he a little overrated the college-culture share\r\nin the production of that result. It can no doubt be easily shown that\r\nthe colleges have contributed the intellectual part of this progress,\r\nand that that part is vast; but that the material progress has been\r\nimmeasurably vaster, I think you will concede. Now I have been looking\r\nover a list of inventors\xe2\x80\x94the creators of this amazing material\r\ndevelopment\xe2\x80\x94and I find that they were not college-bred men. Of course\r\nthere are exceptions\xe2\x80\x94like Professor Henry of Princeton, the inventor of\r\nMr. Morse\xe2\x80\x99s system of telegraphy\xe2\x80\x94but these exceptions are few. It is\r\nnot overstatement to say that the imagination-stunning material\r\ndevelopment of this century, the only century worth living in since\r\ntime itself was invented, is the creation of men not college-bred. We\r\nthink we see what these inventors have done: no, we see only the\r\nvisible vast frontage of their work; behind it is their far vaster\r\nwork, and it is invisible to the careless glance. They have\r\nreconstructed this nation\xe2\x80\x94made it over, that is\xe2\x80\x94and metaphorically\r\nspeaking, have multiplied its numbers almost beyond the power of\r\nfigures to express. I will explain what I mean. What constitutes the\r\npopulation of a land? Merely the numberable packages of meat and bones\r\nin it called by courtesy men and women? Shall a million ounces of brass\r\nand a million ounces of gold be held to be of the same value? Take a\r\ntruer standard: the measure of a man\xe2\x80\x99s contributing capacity to his\r\ntime and his people\xe2\x80\x94the work he can do\xe2\x80\x94and then number the population\r\nof this country to-day, as multiplied by what a man can now do, more\r\nthan his grandfather could do. By this standard of measurement, this\r\nnation, two or three generations ago, consisted of mere cripples,\r\nparalytics, dead men, as compared with the men of to-day. In 1840 our\r\npopulation was 17,000,000. By way of rude but striking illustration,\r\nlet us consider, for argument\xe2\x80\x99s sake, that four of these millions\r\nconsisted of aged people, little children, and other incapables, and\r\nthat the remaining 13,000,000 were divided and employed as follows:\r\n\r\n2,000,000 as ginners of cotton.\r\n\r\n6,000,000 (women) as stocking-knitters.\r\n\r\n2,000,000 (women) as thread-spinners.\r\n\r\n500,000 as screw makers.\r\n\r\n400,000 as reapers, binders, etc.\r\n\r\n1,000,000 as corn-shellers.\r\n\r\n40,000 as weavers.\r\n\r\n1,000 as stitchers of shoe soles.\r\n\r\nNow the deductions which I am going to append to these figures may\r\nsound extravagant, but they are not. I take them from Miscellaneous\r\nDocuments No. 50, second session 45th Congress, and they are official\r\nand trustworthy. To-day, the work of those 2,000,000 cotton-ginners is\r\ndone by 2,000 men; that of the 6,000,000 stocking-knitters is done by\r\n3,000 boys; that of the 2,000,000 thread-spinners is done by 1,000\r\ngirls; that of the 500,000 screw makers is done by 500 girls; that of\r\nthe 400,000 reapers, binders, etc., is done by 4,000 boys; that of the\r\n1,000,000 corn-shellers is done by 7,500 men; that of the 40,000\r\nweavers is done by 1,200 men; and that of the 1,000 stitchers of shoe\r\nsoles is done by 6 men. To bunch the figures, 17,900 persons to-day do\r\nthe above-work, whereas fifty years ago it would have taken thirteen\r\nmillions of persons to do it. Now then, how many of that ignorant\r\nrace\xe2\x80\x94our fathers and grandfathers\xe2\x80\x94with their ignorant methods, would it\r\ntake to do our work to-day? It would take forty thousand millions\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nhundred times the swarming population of China\xe2\x80\x94twenty times the present\r\npopulation of the globe. You look around you and you see a nation of\r\nsixty millions\xe2\x80\x94apparently; but secreted in their hands and brains, and\r\ninvisible to your eyes, is the true population of this Republic, and it\r\nnumbers forty billions! It is the stupendous creation of those humble\r\nunlettered, un-college-bred inventors\xe2\x80\x94all honor to their name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow grand that is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tracy, as he wended homeward. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a\r\ncivilization it is, and what prodigious results these are! and brought\r\nabout almost wholly by common men; not by Oxford-trained aristocrats,\r\nbut men who stand shoulder to shoulder in the humble ranks of life and\r\nearn the bread that they eat. Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I came. I have found a\r\ncountry at last where one may start fair, and breast to breast with his\r\nfellow man, rise by his own efforts, and be something in the world and\r\nbe proud of that something; not be something created by an ancestor\r\nthree hundred years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the first few days he kept the fact diligently before his mind\r\nthat he was in a land where there was \xe2\x80\x9cwork and bread for all.\xe2\x80\x9d In\r\nfact, for convenience\xe2\x80\x99 sake he fitted it to a little tune and hummed it\r\nto himself; but as time wore on the fact itself began to take on a\r\ndoubtful look, and next the tune got fatigued and presently ran down\r\nand stopped. His first effort was to get an upper clerkship in one of\r\nthe departments, where his Oxford education could come into play and do\r\nhim service. But he stood no chance whatever. There, competency was no\r\nrecommendation; political backing, without competency, was worth six of\r\nit. He was glaringly English, and that was necessarily against him in\r\nthe political centre of a nation where both parties prayed for the\r\nIrish cause on the house-top and blasphemed it in the cellar. By his\r\ndress he was a cowboy; that won him respect\xe2\x80\x94when his back was not\r\nturned\xe2\x80\x94but it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a clerkship for him. But he had said, in a\r\nrash moment, that he would wear those clothes till the owner or the\r\nowner\xe2\x80\x99s friends caught sight of them and asked for that money, and his\r\nconscience would not let him retire from that engagement now.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a week things were beginning to wear rather a startling\r\nlook. He had hunted everywhere for work, descending gradually the scale\r\nof quality, until apparently he had sued for all the various kinds of\r\nwork a man without a special calling might hope to be able to do,\r\nexcept ditching and the other coarse manual sorts\xe2\x80\x94and had got neither\r\nwork nor the promise of it.\r\n\r\nHe was mechanically turning over the leaves of his diary, meanwhile,\r\nand now his eye fell upon the first record made after he was burnt out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI myself did not doubt my stamina before, nobody could doubt it now,\r\nif they could see how I am housed, and realise that I feel absolutely\r\nno disgust with these quarters, but am as serenely content with them as\r\nany dog would be in a similar kennel. Terms, twenty-five dollars a\r\nweek. I said I would start at the bottom. I have kept my word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nA shudder went quaking through him, and he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I been thinking of! _This_ the bottom! Mooning along a whole\r\nweek, and these terrific expenses climbing and climbing all the time! I\r\nmust end this folly straightway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe settled up at once and went forth to find less sumptuous lodgings.\r\nHe had to wander far and seek with diligence, but he succeeded. They\r\nmade him pay in advance\xe2\x80\x94four dollars and a half; this secured both bed\r\nand food for a week. The good-natured, hardworked landlady took him up\r\nthree flights of narrow, uncarpeted stairs and delivered him into his\r\nroom. There were two double-bedsteads in it, and one single one. He\r\nwould be allowed to sleep alone in one of the double beds until some\r\nnew boarder should come, but he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be charged extra.\r\n\r\nSo he would presently be required to sleep with some stranger! The\r\nthought of it made him sick. Mrs. Marsh, the landlady, was very\r\nfriendly and hoped he would like her house\xe2\x80\x94they all liked it, she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they\xe2\x80\x99re a very nice set of boys. They carry on a good deal, but\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s their fun. You see, this room opens right into this back one,\r\nand sometimes they\xe2\x80\x99re all in one and sometimes in the other; and hot\r\nnights they all sleep on the roof when it don\xe2\x80\x99t rain. They get out\r\nthere the minute it\xe2\x80\x99s hot enough. The season\xe2\x80\x99s so early that they\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nalready had a night or two up there. If you\xe2\x80\x99d like to go up and pick\r\nout a place, you can. You\xe2\x80\x99ll find chalk in the side of the chimney\r\nwhere there\xe2\x80\x99s a brick wanting. You just take the chalk and\xe2\x80\x94but of\r\ncourse you\xe2\x80\x99ve done it before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course you haven\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94what am I thinking of? Plenty of room on\r\nthe Plains without chalking, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound. Well, you just chalk out a\r\nplace the size of a blanket anywhere on the tin that ain\xe2\x80\x99t already\r\nmarked off, you know, and that\xe2\x80\x99s your property. You and your bed-mate\r\ntake turnabout carrying up the blanket and pillows and fetching them\r\ndown again; or one carries them up and the other fetches them down, you\r\nfix it the way you like, you know. You\xe2\x80\x99ll like the boys, they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\neverlasting sociable\xe2\x80\x94except the printer. He\xe2\x80\x99s the one that sleeps in\r\nthat single bed\xe2\x80\x94the strangest creature; why, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you could\r\nget that man to sleep with another man, not if the house was afire.\r\nMind you, I\xe2\x80\x99m not just talking, I know. The boys tried him, to see.\r\nThey took his bed out one night, and so when he got home about three in\r\nthe morning\xe2\x80\x94he was on a morning paper then, but he\xe2\x80\x99s on an evening one\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any place for him but with the iron-moulder; and if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll believe me, he just set up the rest of the night\xe2\x80\x94he did, honest.\r\nThey say he\xe2\x80\x99s cracked, but it ain\xe2\x80\x99t so, he\xe2\x80\x99s English\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re awful\r\nparticular. You won\xe2\x80\x99t mind my saying that. You\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re English?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought so. I could tell it by the way you mispronounce the words\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s got a\xe2\x80\x99s in them, you know; such as saying loff when you mean\r\nlaff \xe2\x80\x94but you\xe2\x80\x99ll get over that. He\xe2\x80\x99s a right down good fellow, and a\r\nlittle sociable with the photographer\xe2\x80\x99s boy and the caulker and the\r\nblacksmith that work in the navy yard, but not so much with the others.\r\nThe fact is, though it\xe2\x80\x99s private, and the others don\xe2\x80\x99t know it, he\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nkind of an aristocrat, his father being a doctor, and _you_ know what\r\nstyle _that_ is\xe2\x80\x94in England, I mean, because in this country a doctor\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t so _very_ much, even if he\xe2\x80\x99s _that_. But over there of course\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s different. So this chap had a falling out with his father, and was\r\npretty high strung, and just cut for this country, and the first he\r\nknew he had to get to work or starve. Well, he\xe2\x80\x99d been to college, you\r\nsee, and so he judged _he_ was all right\xe2\x80\x94did you say anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I only sighed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s where he was mistaken. Why, he mighty near starved. And I\r\nreckon he would have starved sure enough, if some jour\xe2\x80\x99 printer or\r\nother hadn\xe2\x80\x99t took pity on him and got him a place as apprentice. So he\r\nlearnt the trade, and then he was all right\xe2\x80\x94but it was a close call.\r\nOnce he thought he had _got_ to haul in his pride and holler for his\r\nfather and\xe2\x80\x94why, you\xe2\x80\x99re sighing again. Is anything the matter with\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x94does my clatter\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _dear_\xe2\x80\x94no. Pray go on\xe2\x80\x94I like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you see, he\xe2\x80\x99s been over here ten years; he\xe2\x80\x99s twenty-eight, now,\r\nand he ain\xe2\x80\x99t pretty well satisfied in his mind, because he can\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nreconciled to being a mechanic and associating with mechanics, he\r\nbeing, as he says to me, a _gentleman_, which is a pretty plain\r\nletting-on that the boys ain\xe2\x80\x99t, but of course I know enough not to let\r\n_that_ cat out of the bag.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94would there be any harm in it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarm in it? They\xe2\x80\x99d lick him, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they? Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t _you?_ Of course\r\nyou would. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you ever let a man say you ain\xe2\x80\x99t a gentleman in _this_\r\ncountry. But laws, what am I thinking about? I reckon a body would\r\nthink twice before he said a cowboy wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA trim, active, slender and very pretty girl of about eighteen walked\r\ninto the room now, in the most satisfied and unembarrassed way. She was\r\ncheaply but smartly and gracefully dressed, and the mother\xe2\x80\x99s quick\r\nglance at the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s face as he rose, was of the kind which\r\ninquires what effect has been produced, and expects to find indications\r\nof surprise and admiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is my daughter Hattie\xe2\x80\x94we call her Puss. It\xe2\x80\x99s the new boarder,\r\nPuss.\xe2\x80\x9d This without rising.\r\n\r\nThe young Englishman made the awkward bow common to his nationality and\r\ntime of life in circumstances of delicacy and difficulty, and these\r\nwere of that sort; for, being taken by surprise, his natural, lifelong\r\nself sprang to the front, and that self of course would not know just\r\nhow to act when introduced to a chambermaid, or to the heiress of a\r\nmechanics\xe2\x80\x99 boarding house. His other self\xe2\x80\x94the self which recognized the\r\nequality of all men\xe2\x80\x94would have managed the thing better, if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeen caught off guard and robbed of its chance. The young girl paid no\r\nattention to the bow, but put out her hand frankly and gave the\r\nstranger a friendly shake and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\np109.jpg (23K)\r\n\r\nThen she marched to the one washstand in the room, tilted her head this\r\nway and that before the wreck of a cheap mirror that hung above it,\r\ndampened her fingers with her tongue, perfected the circle of a little\r\nlock of hair that was pasted against her forehead, then began to busy\r\nherself with the slops.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I must be going\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s getting towards supper time. Make yourself\r\nat home, Mr. Tracy, you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the bell when it\xe2\x80\x99s ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe landlady took her tranquil departure, without commanding either of\r\nthe young people to vacate the room. The young man wondered a little\r\nthat a mother who seemed so honest and respectable should be so\r\nthoughtless, and was reaching for his hat, intending to disembarrass\r\nthe girl of his presence; but she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94nowhere in particular, but as I am only in the way here\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, who said you were in the way? Sit down\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll move you when you are\r\nin the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was making the beds, now. He sat down and watched her deft and\r\ndiligent performance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat gave you that notion? Do you reckon I need a whole room just to\r\nmake up a bed or two in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell no, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that, exactly. We are away up here in an empty\r\nhouse, and your mother being gone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl interrupted him with an amused laugh, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody to protect me? Bless you, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need it. I\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid. I\r\nmight be if I was alone, because I do hate ghosts, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny it.\r\nNot that I believe in them, for I don\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99m only just afraid of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you be afraid of them if you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t know the _how_ of it\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s too many for _me;_ I only\r\nknow it\xe2\x80\x99s _so_. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same with Maggie Lee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the boarders; young lady that works in the fact\xe2\x80\x99ry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe works in a factory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Shoe factory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a shoe factory; and you call her a young lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, she\xe2\x80\x99s only twenty-two; what should you call her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking of her age, I was thinking of the title. The fact\r\nis, I came away from England to get away from artificial forms\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nartificial forms suit artificial people only\xe2\x80\x94and here you\xe2\x80\x99ve got them\r\ntoo. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I hoped you had only men and women; everybody equal; no\r\ndifferences in rank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl stopped with a pillow in her teeth and the case spread open\r\nbelow it, contemplating him from under her brows with a slightly\r\npuzzled expression. She released the pillow and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, they _are_ all equal. Where\xe2\x80\x99s any difference in rank?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you call a factory girl a young _lady_, what do you call the\r\nPresident\xe2\x80\x99s wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall her an _old_ one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you make age the only distinction?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere ain\xe2\x80\x99t any other to make as far as I can see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen _all_ women are ladies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly they are. All the respectable ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that puts a better face on it. Certainly there is no harm in a\r\ntitle when it is given to everybody. It is only an offense and a wrong\r\nwhen it is restricted to a favored few. But Miss\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHattie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Hattie, be frank; confess that that title _isn\xe2\x80\x99t_ accorded by\r\neverybody to everybody. The rich American doesn\xe2\x80\x99t call her cook a\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t that so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s so. What of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was surprised and a little disappointed, to see that his admirable\r\nshot had produced no perceptible effect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _of_ it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy this: equality is _not_ conceded here,\r\nafter all, and the Americans are no better off than the English. In\r\nfact there\xe2\x80\x99s no difference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow _what_ an idea. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in a title except what is _put_\r\ninto it\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve said that yourself. Suppose the title is _clean_,\r\ninstead of lady. You get that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe so. Instead of speaking of a woman as a _lady_, you\r\nsubstitute clean and say she\xe2\x80\x99s a clean person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it. In England the swell folks don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of the working\r\npeople as gentlemen and ladies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the working people don\xe2\x80\x99t call _themselves_ gentlemen and ladies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo if you used the other word there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be any change. The swell\r\npeople wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call anybody but themselves \xe2\x80\x98clean,\xe2\x80\x99 and those others\r\nwould drop sort of meekly into their way of talking and _they_ wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncall themselves clean. We don\xe2\x80\x99t do that way here. Everybody calls\r\nhimself a lady or gentleman, and thinks he _is_, and don\xe2\x80\x99t care what\r\nanybody else thinks him, so long as he don\xe2\x80\x99t say it out loud. You think\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no difference. You _knuckle down_ and we _don\xe2\x80\x99t_. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t that a\r\ndifference?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a difference I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought of; I admit that. Still\xe2\x80\x94_calling_\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s self a lady doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go on if I were you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHoward Tracy turned his head to see who it might be that had introduced\r\nthis remark. It was a short man about forty years old, with sandy hair,\r\nno beard, and a pleasant face badly freckled but alive and intelligent,\r\nand he wore slop-shop clothing which was neat but showed wear. He had\r\ncome from the front room beyond the hall, where he had left his hat,\r\nand he had a chipped and cracked white wash-bowl in his hand. The girl\r\ncame and took the bowl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get it for you. You go right ahead and _give_ it to him, Mr.\r\nBarrow. He\xe2\x80\x99s the new boarder\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Tracy\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99d just got to where it was\r\ngetting too deep for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch obliged if you will, Hattie. I was coming to borrow of the boys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe sat down at his ease on an old trunk, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been listening\r\nand got interested; and as I was saying, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go on, if I were\r\nyou. You see where you are coming to, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? _Calling_ yourself a\r\nlady doesn\xe2\x80\x99t elect you; that is what you were going to say; and you saw\r\nthat if you said it you were going to run right up against another\r\ndifference that you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought of: to-wit, Whose _right_ is it to\r\ndo the electing? Over there, twenty thousand people in a million elect\r\nthemselves gentlemen and ladies, and the nine hundred and eighty\r\nthousand _accept_ that decree and swallow the affront which it puts\r\nupon them. Why, if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t accept it, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t _be_ an election,\r\nit would be a dead letter and have no force at all. Over here the\r\ntwenty thousand would-be exclusives come up to the polls and vote\r\nthemselves to be ladies and gentlemen. But the thing doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stop\r\nthere. The nine hundred and eighty thousand come and vote themselves to\r\nbe ladies and gentlemen _too_, and that elects the whole nation. Since\r\nthe whole million vote themselves ladies and gentlemen, there is no\r\nquestion about that election. It _does_ make absolute equality, and\r\nthere is no fiction about it; while over yonder the _inequality_, (by\r\ndecree of the infinitely feeble, and consent of the infinitely strong,)\r\nis also absolute\xe2\x80\x94as real and absolute as our equality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy had shrunk promptly into his English shell when this speech\r\nbegan, notwithstanding he had now been in severe training several weeks\r\nfor contact and intercourse with the common herd on the common herd\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nterms; but he lost no time in pulling himself out again, and so by the\r\ntime the speech was finished his valves were open once more, and he was\r\nforcing himself to accept without resentment the common herd\xe2\x80\x99s frank\r\nfashion of dropping sociably into other people\xe2\x80\x99s conversations\r\nunembarrassed and uninvited. The process was not very difficult this\r\ntime, for the man\xe2\x80\x99s smile and voice and manner were persuasive and\r\nwinning. Tracy would even have liked him on the spot, but for the\r\nfact\xe2\x80\x94fact which he was not really aware of\xe2\x80\x94that the equality of men was\r\nnot yet a reality to him, it was only a theory; the _mind_ perceived,\r\nbut the _man_ failed to feel it. It was Hattie\xe2\x80\x99s ghost over again,\r\nmerely turned around. Theoretically Barrow was his equal, but it was\r\ndistinctly distasteful to see him exhibit it. He presently said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope in all sincerity that what you have said is true, as regards\r\nthe Americans, for doubts have crept into my mind several times. It\r\nseemed that the equality must be ungenuine where the sign-names of\r\ncastes were still in vogue; but those sign-names have certainly lost\r\ntheir offence and are wholly neutralized, nullified and harmless if\r\nthey are the undisputed property of every individual in the nation. I\r\nthink I realize that caste does not exist and cannot exist except by\r\ncommon consent of the masses outside of its limits. I thought caste\r\ncreated itself and perpetuated itself; but it seems quite true that it\r\nonly creates itself, and is perpetuated by the people whom it despises,\r\nand who can dissolve it at any time by assuming its mere sign-names\r\nthemselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s what I think. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t any power on earth that can prevent\r\nEngland\xe2\x80\x99s thirty millions from electing themselves dukes and duchesses\r\nto-morrow and calling themselves so. And within six months all the\r\nformer dukes and duchesses would have retired from the business. I wish\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d try that. Royalty itself couldn\xe2\x80\x99t survive such a process. A\r\nhandful of frowners against thirty million laughers in a state of\r\nirruption. Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s Herculaneum against Vesuvius; it would take\r\nanother eighteen centuries to find that Herculaneum after the\r\ncataclysm. What\xe2\x80\x99s a Colonel in our South? He\xe2\x80\x99s a nobody; because\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re all colonels down there. No, Tracy\xe2\x80\x9d (shudder from Tracy)\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnobody in England would call you a gentleman and you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call\r\nyourself one; and I tell you it\xe2\x80\x99s a state of things that makes a man\r\nput himself into most unbecoming attitudes sometimes\xe2\x80\x94the broad and\r\ngeneral recognition and acceptance of caste _as_ caste does, I mean.\r\nMakes him do it unconsciously\xe2\x80\x94being bred in him, you see, and never\r\nthought over and reasoned out. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t conceive of the Matterhorn\r\nbeing flattered by the notice of one of your comely little English\r\nhills, could you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, let a man in his right mind try to conceive of Darwin\r\nfeeling flattered by the notice of a princess. It\xe2\x80\x99s so grotesque that\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94well, it paralyzes the imagination. Yet that Memnon _was_ flattered\r\nby the notice of that statuette; he _says_ so\xe2\x80\x94says so himself. The\r\nsystem that can make a god disown his godship and profane it\xe2\x80\x94oh, well,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s all wrong, it\xe2\x80\x99s all wrong and ought to be abolished, I should\r\nsay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mention of Darwin brought on a literary discussion, and this topic\r\nroused such enthusiasm in Barrow that he took off his coat and made\r\nhimself the more free and comfortable for it, and detained him so long\r\nthat he was still at it when the noisy proprietors of the room came\r\nshouting and skylarking in and began to romp, scuffle, wash, and\r\notherwise entertain themselves. He lingered yet a little longer to\r\noffer the hospitalities of his room and his book shelf to Tracy and ask\r\nhim a personal question or two:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your trade?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x94well, they call me a cowboy, but that is a fancy. I\xe2\x80\x99m not that. I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t any trade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you work at for your living?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, anything\xe2\x80\x94I mean I _would_ work at, anything I could get to do, but\r\nthus far I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to find an occupation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe I can help you; I\xe2\x80\x99d like to try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be very glad. I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried, myself, to weariness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course where a man hasn\xe2\x80\x99t a regular trade he\xe2\x80\x99s pretty bad off\r\nin this world. What you needed, I reckon, was less book learning and\r\nmore bread-and-butter learning. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what your father could\r\nhave been thinking of. You ought to have had a trade, you ought to have\r\nhad a trade, by _all_ means. But never mind about that; we\xe2\x80\x99ll stir up\r\n_something_ to do, I guess. And don\xe2\x80\x99t you get homesick; that\xe2\x80\x99s a bad\r\nbusiness. We\xe2\x80\x99ll talk the thing over and look around a little. You\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncome out all right. Wait for me\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll go down to supper with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time Tracy had achieved a very friendly feeling for Barrow and\r\nwould have _called_ him a friend, maybe, if not taken too suddenly on a\r\nstraight-out requirement to realize on his theories. He was glad of his\r\nsociety, anyway, and was feeling lighter hearted than before. Also he\r\nwas pretty curious to know what vocation it might be which had\r\nfurnished Barrow such a large acquaintanceship with books and allowed\r\nhim so much time to read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresently the supper bell began to ring in the depths of the house, and\r\nthe sound proceeded steadily upward, growing in intensity all the way\r\nup towards the upper floors. The higher it came the more maddening was\r\nthe noise, until at last what it lacked of being absolutely deafening,\r\nwas made up of the sudden crash and clatter of an avalanche of boarders\r\ndown the uncarpeted stairway. The peerage did not go to meals in this\r\nfashion; Tracy\xe2\x80\x99s training had not fitted him to enjoy this hilarious\r\nzoological clamor and enthusiasm. He had to confess that there was\r\nsomething about this extraordinary outpouring of animal spirits which\r\nhe would have to get inured to before he could accept it. No doubt in\r\ntime he would prefer it; but he wished the process might be modified\r\nand made just a little more gradual, and not quite so pronounced and\r\nviolent. Barrow and Tracy followed the avalanche down through an ever\r\nincreasing and ever more and more aggressive stench of bygone cabbage\r\nand kindred smells; smells which are to be found nowhere but in a cheap\r\nprivate boarding house; smells which once encountered can never be\r\nforgotten; smells which encountered generations later are instantly\r\nrecognizable, but never recognizable with pleasure. To Tracy these\r\nodors were suffocating, horrible, almost unendurable; but he held his\r\npeace and said nothing. Arrived in the basement, they entered a large\r\ndining-room where thirty-five or forty people sat at a long table. They\r\ntook their places. The feast had already begun and the conversation was\r\ngoing on in the liveliest way from one end of the table to the other.\r\nThe table cloth was of very coarse material and was liberally spotted\r\nwith coffee stains and grease. The knives and forks were iron, with\r\nbone handles, the spoons appeared to be iron or sheet iron or something\r\nof the sort. The tea and coffee cups were of the commonest and heaviest\r\nand most durable stone ware. All the furniture of the table was of the\r\ncommonest and cheapest sort. There was a single large thick slice of\r\nbread by each boarder\xe2\x80\x99s plate, and it was observable that he economized\r\nit as if he were not expecting it to be duplicated. Dishes of butter\r\nwere distributed along the table within reach of people\xe2\x80\x99s arms, if they\r\nhad long ones, but there were no private butter plates. The butter was\r\nperhaps good enough, and was quiet and well behaved; but it had more\r\nbouquet than was necessary, though nobody commented upon that fact or\r\nseemed in any way disturbed by it. The main feature of the feast was a\r\npiping hot Irish stew made of the potatoes and meat left over from a\r\nprocession of previous meals. Everybody was liberally supplied with\r\nthis dish. On the table were a couple of great dishes of sliced ham,\r\nand there were some other eatables of minor importance\xe2\x80\x94preserves and\r\nNew Orleans molasses and such things. There was also plenty of tea and\r\ncoffee of an infernal sort, with brown sugar and condensed milk, but\r\nthe milk and sugar supply was not left at the discretion of the\r\nboarders, but was rationed out at headquarters\xe2\x80\x94one spoonful of sugar\r\nand one of condensed milk to each cup and no more. The table was waited\r\nupon by two stalwart negro women who raced back and forth from the\r\nbases of supplies with splendid dash and clatter and energy. Their\r\nlabors were supplemented after a fashion by the young girl Puss. She\r\ncarried coffee and tea back and forth among the boarders, but she made\r\npleasure excursions rather than business ones in this way, to speak\r\nstrictly. She made jokes with various people. She chaffed the young men\r\npleasantly and wittily, as she supposed, and as the rest also supposed,\r\napparently, judging by the applause and laughter which she got by her\r\nefforts. Manifestly she was a favorite with most of the young fellows\r\nand sweetheart of the rest of them. Where she conferred notice she\r\nconferred happiness, as was seen by the face of the recipient; and at\r\nthe same time she conferred unhappiness\xe2\x80\x94one could see it fall and dim\r\nthe faces of the other young fellows like a shadow. She never\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMistered\xe2\x80\x9d these friends of hers, but called them \xe2\x80\x9cBilly,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTom,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn,\xe2\x80\x9d and they called her \xe2\x80\x9cPuss\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cHattie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Marsh sat at the head of the table, his wife sat at the foot. Marsh\r\nwas a man of sixty, and was an American; but if he had been born a\r\nmonth earlier he would have been a Spaniard. He was plenty good enough\r\nSpaniard as it was; his face was very dark, his hair very black, and\r\nhis eyes were not only exceedingly black but were very intense, and\r\nthere was something about them that indicated that they could burn with\r\npassion upon occasion. He was stoop-shouldered and lean-faced, and the\r\ngeneral aspect of him was disagreeable; he was evidently not a very\r\ncompanionable person. If looks went for anything, he was the very\r\nopposite of his wife, who was all motherliness and charity, good will\r\nand good nature. All the young men and the women called her Aunt\r\nRachael, which was another sign. Tracy\xe2\x80\x99s wandering and interested eye\r\npresently fell upon one boarder who had been overlooked in the\r\ndistribution of the stew. He was very pale and looked as if he had but\r\nlately come out of a sick bed, and also as if he ought to get back into\r\nit again as soon as possible. His face was very melancholy. The waves\r\nof laughter and conversation broke upon it without affecting it any\r\nmore than if it had been a rock in the sea and the words and the\r\nlaughter veritable waters. He held his head down and looked ashamed.\r\nSome of the women cast glances of pity toward him from time to time in\r\na furtive and half afraid way, and some of the youngest of the men\r\nplainly had compassion on the young fellow\xe2\x80\x94a compassion exhibited in\r\ntheir faces but not in any more active or compromising way. But the\r\ngreat majority of the people present showed entire indifference to the\r\nyouth and his sorrows. Marsh sat with his head down, but one could\r\ncatch the malicious gleam of his eyes through his shaggy brows. He was\r\nwatching that young fellow with evident relish. He had not neglected\r\nhim through carelessness, and apparently the table understood that\r\nfact. The spectacle was making Mrs. Marsh very uncomfortable. She had\r\nthe look of one who hopes against hope that the impossible may happen.\r\nBut as the impossible did not happen, she finally ventured to speak up\r\nand remind her husband that Nat Brady hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been helped to the Irish\r\nstew.\r\n\r\nMarsh lifted his head and gasped out with mock courtliness, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he? What a pity that is. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I came to\r\noverlook him. Ah, he must pardon me. You must indeed\r\nMr\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94Baxter\xe2\x80\x94Barker, you must pardon me. I\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94my attention was directed\r\nto some other matter, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what. The thing that grieves me\r\nmainly is, that it happens every meal now. But you must try to overlook\r\nthese little things, Mr. Bunker, these little neglects on my part.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re always likely to happen with me in any case, and they are\r\nespecially likely to happen where a person has\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94well, where a person\r\nis, say, about three weeks in arrears for his board. You get my\r\nmeaning?\xe2\x80\x94you get my idea? Here is your Irish stew, and\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94it gives me\r\nthe greatest pleasure to send it to you, and I hope that you will enjoy\r\nthe charity as much as I enjoy conferring it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA blush rose in Brady\xe2\x80\x99s white cheeks and flowed slowly backward to his\r\nears and upward toward his forehead, but he said nothing and began to\r\neat his food under the embarrassment of a general silence and the sense\r\nthat all eyes were fastened upon him. Barrow whispered to Tracy:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old man\xe2\x80\x99s been waiting for that. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have missed that\r\nchance for anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a brutal business,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tracy. Then he said to himself,\r\npurposing to set the thought down in his diary later:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, here in this very house is a republic where all are free and\r\nequal, if men are free and equal anywhere in the earth, therefore I\r\nhave arrived at the place I started to find, and I am a man among men,\r\nand on the strictest equality possible to men, no doubt. Yet here on\r\nthe threshold I find an inequality. There are people at this table who\r\nare looked up to for some reason or another, and here is a poor devil\r\nof a boy who is looked down upon, treated with indifference, and shamed\r\nby humiliations, when he has committed no crime but that common one of\r\nbeing poor. Equality ought to make men noble-minded. In fact I had\r\nsupposed it did do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter supper, Barrow proposed a walk, and they started. Barrow had a\r\npurpose. He wanted Tracy to get rid of that cowboy hat. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nhis way to finding mechanical or manual employment for a person rigged\r\nin that fashion. Barrow presently said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I understand it, you\xe2\x80\x99re not a cowboy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now if you will not think me too curious, how did you come to\r\nmount that hat? Where\xe2\x80\x99d you get it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy didn\xe2\x80\x99t know quite how to reply to this, but presently said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, without going into particulars, I exchanged clothes with a\r\nstranger under stress of weather, and I would like to find him and\r\nre-exchange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you find him? Where is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I supposed the best way to find him would be to continue\r\nto wear his clothes, which are conspicuous enough to attract his\r\nattention if I should meet him on the street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Barrow, \xe2\x80\x9cthe rest of the outfit, is well enough,\r\nand while it\xe2\x80\x99s not too conspicuous, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite like the clothes\r\nthat anybody else wears. Suppress the hat. When you meet your man he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nrecognize the rest of his suit. That\xe2\x80\x99s a mighty embarrassing hat, you\r\nknow, in a centre of civilization like this. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe an angel\r\ncould get employment in Washington in a halo like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\np124.jpg (22K)\r\n\r\nTracy agreed to replace the hat with something of a modester form, and\r\nthey stepped aboard a crowded car and stood with others on the rear\r\nplatform. Presently, as the car moved swiftly along the rails, two men\r\ncrossing the street caught sight of the backs of Barrow and Tracy, and\r\nboth exclaimed at once, \xe2\x80\x9cThere he is!\xe2\x80\x9d It was Sellers and Hawkins. Both\r\nwere so paralyzed with joy that before they could pull themselves\r\ntogether and make an effort to stop the car, it was gone too far, and\r\nthey decided to wait for the next one. They waited a while; then it\r\noccurred to Washington that there could be no use in chasing one\r\nhorse-car with another, and he wanted to hunt up a hack. But the\r\nColonel said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you come to think of it, there\xe2\x80\x99s no occasion for that at all. Now\r\nthat I\xe2\x80\x99ve got him materialized, I can command his motions. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nhim at the house by the time we get there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they hurried off home in a state of great and joyful excitement.\r\n\r\nThe hat exchange accomplished, the two new friends started to walk back\r\nleisurely to the boarding house. Barrow\xe2\x80\x99s mind was full of curiosity\r\nabout this young fellow. He said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve never been to the Rocky Mountains?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve never been out on the plains?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long have you been in this country?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a few days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve never been in America before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Barrow communed with himself. \xe2\x80\x9cNow what odd shapes the notions of\r\nromantic people take. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a young fellow who\xe2\x80\x99s read in England about\r\ncowboys and adventures on the plains. He comes here and buys a cowboy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuit. Thinks he can play himself on folks for a cowboy, all\r\ninexperienced as he is. Now the minute he\xe2\x80\x99s caught in this poor little\r\ngame, he\xe2\x80\x99s ashamed of it and ready to retire from it. It is that\r\nexchange that he has put up as an explanation. It\xe2\x80\x99s rather thin, too\r\nthin altogether. Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s young, never been anywhere, knows nothing\r\nabout the world, sentimental, no doubt. Perhaps it was the natural\r\nthing for him to do, but it was a most singular choice, curious freak,\r\naltogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth men were busy with their thoughts for a time, then Tracy heaved a\r\nsigh and said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Barrow, the case of that young fellow troubles me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean Nat Brady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Brady, or Baxter, or whatever it was. The old landlord called him\r\nby several different names.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, he has been very liberal with names for Brady, since Brady\r\nfell into arrears for his board. Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s one of his sarcasms\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nold man thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s great on sarcasm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is Brady\xe2\x80\x99s difficulty? What is Brady\xe2\x80\x94who is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrady is a tinner. He\xe2\x80\x99s a young journeyman tinner who was getting\r\nalong all right till he fell sick and lost his job. He was very popular\r\nbefore he lost his job; everybody in the house liked Brady. The old man\r\nwas rather especially fond of him, but you know that when a man loses\r\nhis job and loses his ability to support himself and to pay his way as\r\nhe goes, it makes a great difference in the way people look at him and\r\nfeel about him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that so! _Is_ it so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBarrow looked at Tracy in a puzzled way. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy of course it\xe2\x80\x99s so.\r\nWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you know that, naturally. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know that the wounded deer\r\nis always attacked and killed by its companions and friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy said to himself, while a chilly and boding discomfort spread\r\nitself through his system, \xe2\x80\x9cIn a republic of deer and men where all are\r\nfree and equal, misfortune is a crime, and the prosperous gore the\r\nunfortunate to death.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he said aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cHere in the boarding house,\r\nif one would have friends and be popular instead of having the cold\r\nshoulder turned upon him, he must be prosperous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Barrow said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is so. It\xe2\x80\x99s their human nature. They do turn\r\nagainst Brady, now that he\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t like him as\r\nwell as they did before; but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t because of any lack in Brady\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njust as he was before, has the same nature and the same impulses, but\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x94well, Brady is a thorn in their consciences, you see. They know\r\nthey ought to help him and they\xe2\x80\x99re too stingy to do it, and they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nashamed of themselves for that, and they ought also to hate themselves\r\non that account, but instead of that they hate Brady because he makes\r\nthem ashamed of themselves. I say that\xe2\x80\x99s human nature; that occurs\r\neverywhere; this boarding house is merely the world in little, it\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ncase all over\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re all alike. In prosperity we are popular;\r\npopularity comes easy in that case, but when the other thing comes our\r\nfriends are pretty likely to turn against us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy\xe2\x80\x99s noble theories and high purposes were beginning to feel pretty\r\ndamp and clammy. He wondered if by any possibility he had made a\r\nmistake in throwing his own prosperity to the winds and taking up the\r\ncross of other people\xe2\x80\x99s unprosperity. But he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t listen to that\r\nsort of thing; he cast it out of his mind and resolved to go ahead\r\nresolutely along the course he had mapped out for himself.\r\n\r\nExtracts from his diary:\r\n\r\n\r\nHave now spent several days in this singular hive. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know quite\r\nwhat to make out of these people. They have merits and virtues, but\r\nthey have some other qualities, and some ways that are hard to get\r\nalong with. I can\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy them. The moment I appeared in a hat of the\r\nperiod, I noticed a change. The respect which had been paid me before,\r\npassed suddenly away, and the people became friendly\xe2\x80\x94more than\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94they became familiar, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not used to familiarity, and can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake to it right off; I find that out. These people\xe2\x80\x99s familiarity\r\namounts to impudence, sometimes. I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s all right; no doubt I\r\ncan get used to it, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not a satisfactory process at all. I have\r\naccomplished my dearest wish, I am a man among men, on an equal footing\r\nwith Tom, Dick and Harry, and yet it isn\xe2\x80\x99t just exactly what I thought\r\nit was going to be. I\xe2\x80\x94I miss home. Am obliged to say I am homesick.\r\nAnother thing\xe2\x80\x94and this is a confession\xe2\x80\x94a reluctant one, but I will make\r\nit: The thing I miss most and most severely, is the respect, the\r\ndeference, with which I was treated all my life in England, and which\r\nseems to be somehow necessary to me. I get along very well without the\r\nluxury and the wealth and the sort of society I\xe2\x80\x99ve been accustomed to,\r\nbut I do miss the respect and can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to get reconciled to the\r\nabsence of it. There is respect, there is deference here, but it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t fall to my share. It is lavished on two men. One of them is a\r\nportly man of middle age who is a retired plumber. Everybody is pleased\r\nto have that man\xe2\x80\x99s notice. He\xe2\x80\x99s full of pomp and circumstance and self\r\ncomplacency and bad grammar, and at table he is Sir Oracle and when he\r\nopens his mouth not any dog in the kennel barks. The other person is a\r\npoliceman at the capitol-building. He represents the government. The\r\ndeference paid to these two men is not so very far short of that paid\r\nto an earl in England, though the method of it differs. Not so much\r\ncourtliness, but the deference is all there.\r\n\r\nYes, and there is obsequiousness, too.\r\n\r\nIt does rather look as if in a republic where all are free and equal,\r\nprosperity and position constitute _rank_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe days drifted by, and they grew ever more dreary. For Barrow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nefforts to find work for Tracy were unavailing. Always the first\r\nquestion asked was, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Union do you belong to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy was obliged to reply that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to any trade-union.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then, it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to employ you. My men wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay\r\nwith me if I should employ a \xe2\x80\x98scab,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98rat,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d or whatever the phrase\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nFinally, Tracy had a happy thought. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy the thing for me to\r\ndo, of course, is to _join_ a trade-union.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Barrow said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is the thing for you to do\xe2\x80\x94if you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I _can?_ Is it difficult?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d Barrow said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s sometimes difficult\xe2\x80\x94in fact, very\r\ndifficult. But you can try, and of course it will be best to try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTherefore Tracy tried; but he did not succeed. He was refused admission\r\nwith a good deal of promptness, and was advised to go back home, where\r\nhe belonged, not come here taking honest men\xe2\x80\x99s bread out of their\r\nmouths. Tracy began to realize that the situation was desperate, and\r\nthe thought made him cold to the marrow. He said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cSo there\r\nis an aristocracy of position here, and an aristocracy of prosperity,\r\nand apparently there is also an aristocracy of the ins as opposed to\r\nthe outs, and I am with the outs. So the ranks grow daily, here.\r\nPlainly there are all kinds of castes here and only one that I belong\r\nto, the outcasts.\xe2\x80\x9d But he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even smile at his small joke,\r\nalthough he was obliged to confess that he had a rather good opinion of\r\nit. He was feeling so defeated and miserable by this time that he could\r\nno longer look with philosophical complacency on the horseplay of the\r\nyoung fellows in the upper rooms at night. At first it had been\r\npleasant to see them unbend and have a good time after having so well\r\nearned it by the labors of the day, but now it all rasped upon his\r\nfeelings and his dignity. He lost patience with the spectacle. When\r\nthey were feeling good, they shouted, they scuffled, they sang songs,\r\nthey romped about the place like cattle, and they generally wound up\r\nwith a pillow fight, in which they banged each other over the head, and\r\nthrew the pillows in all directions, and every now and then he got a\r\nbuffet himself; and they were always inviting him to join in. They\r\ncalled him \xe2\x80\x9cJohnny Bull,\xe2\x80\x9d and invited him with excessive familiarity to\r\ntake a hand. At first he had endured all this with good nature, but\r\nlatterly he had shown by his manner that it was distinctly distasteful\r\nto him, and very soon he saw a change in the manner of these young\r\npeople toward him. They were souring on him as they would have\r\nexpressed it in their language. He had never been what might be called\r\npopular. That was hardly the phrase for it; he had merely been liked,\r\nbut now dislike for him was growing. His case was not helped by the\r\nfact that he was out of luck, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get work, didn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to a\r\nunion, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t gain admission to one. He got a good many slights\r\nof that small ill-defined sort that you can\xe2\x80\x99t quite put your finger on,\r\nand it was manifest that there was only one thing which protected him\r\nfrom open insult, and that was his muscle. These young people had seen\r\nhim exercising, mornings, after his cold sponge bath, and they had\r\nperceived by his performance and the build of his body, that he was\r\nathletic, and also versed in boxing. He felt pretty naked now,\r\nrecognizing that he was shorn of all respect except respect for his\r\nfists. One night when he entered his room he found about a dozen of the\r\nyoung fellows there carrying on a very lively conversation punctuated\r\nwith horse-laughter. The talking ceased instantly, and the frank\r\naffront of a dead silence followed. He said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d and sat down.\r\n\r\nThere was no response. He flushed to the temples but forced himself to\r\nmaintain silence. He sat there in this uncomfortable stillness some\r\ntime, then got up and went out.\r\n\r\nThe moment he had disappeared he heard a prodigious shout of laughter\r\nbreak forth. He saw that their plain purpose had been to insult him. He\r\nascended to the flat roof, hoping to be able to cool down his spirit\r\nthere and get back his tranquility. He found the young tinner up there,\r\nalone and brooding, and entered into conversation with him. They were\r\npretty fairly matched, now, in unpopularity and general ill-luck and\r\nmisery, and they had no trouble in meeting upon this common ground with\r\nadvantage and something of comfort to both. But Tracy\xe2\x80\x99s movements had\r\nbeen watched, and in a few minutes the tormentors came straggling one\r\nafter another to the roof, where they began to stroll up and down in an\r\napparently purposeless way. But presently they fell to dropping remarks\r\nthat were evidently aimed at Tracy, and some of them at the tinner. The\r\nringleader of this little mob was a short-haired bully and amateur\r\nprize-fighter named Allen, who was accustomed to lording it over the\r\nupper floor, and had more than once shown a disposition to make trouble\r\nwith Tracy. Now there was an occasional cat-call, and hootings, and\r\nwhistlings, and finally the diversion of an exchange of connected\r\nremarks was introduced:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many does it take to make a pair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, two generally makes a pair, but sometimes there ain\xe2\x80\x99t stuff\r\nenough in them to make a whole pair.\xe2\x80\x9d General laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were you saying about the English a while ago?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing, the English are all right, only\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it you _said_ about them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I only said they swallow well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwallow better than other people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, the English swallow a good deal better than other people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it they swallow best?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, insults.\xe2\x80\x9d Another general laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty hard to make \xe2\x80\x99em fight, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, taint hard to make \xe2\x80\x99em fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t it, really?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, taint hard. It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d Another laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis one\xe2\x80\x99s kind of spiritless, that\xe2\x80\x99s certain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ be the other way\xe2\x80\x94in his case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know the secret of his birth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! has _he_ got a secret of his birth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet he has.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis father was a wax-figger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAllen came strolling by where the pair were sitting; stopped, and said\r\nto the tinner;\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you off for friends, these days?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell enough off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGot a good many?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, as many as I need.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA friend is valuable, sometimes\xe2\x80\x94as a protector, you know. What do you\r\nreckon would happen if I was to snatch your cap off and slap you in the\r\nface with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble me, Mr. Allen, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t doing anything to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou answer me! What do you reckon would happen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy spoke up with a good deal of deliberation and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t trouble the young fellow, I can tell you what would happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you can, can you? Boys, Johnny Bull can tell us what would happen\r\nif I was to snatch this chump\xe2\x80\x99s cap off and slap him in the face with\r\nit. Now you\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe snatched the cap and struck the youth in the face, and before he\r\ncould inquire what was going to happen, it had already happened, and he\r\nwas warming the tin with the broad of his back. Instantly there was a\r\nrush, and shouts of:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA ring, a ring, make a ring! Fair play all round! Johnny\xe2\x80\x99s grit; give\r\nhim a chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ring was quickly chalked on the tin, and Tracy found himself as\r\neager to begin as he could have been if his antagonist had been a\r\nprince instead of a mechanic. At bottom he was a little surprised at\r\nthis, because although his theories had been all in that direction for\r\nsome time, he was not prepared to find himself actually eager to\r\nmeasure strength with quite so common a man as this ruffian. In a\r\nmoment all the windows in the neighborhood were filled with people, and\r\nthe roofs also. The men squared off, and the fight began. But Allen\r\nstood no chance whatever, against the young Englishman. Neither in\r\nmuscle nor in science was he his equal. He measured his length on the\r\ntin time and again; in fact, as fast as he could get up he went down\r\nagain, and the applause was kept up in liberal fashion from all the\r\nneighborhood around. Finally, Allen had to be helped up. Then Tracy\r\ndeclined to punish him further and the fight was at an end. Allen was\r\ncarried off by some of his friends in a very much humbled condition,\r\nhis face black and blue and bleeding, and Tracy was at once surrounded\r\nby the young fellows, who congratulated him, and told him that he had\r\ndone the whole house a service, and that from this out Mr. Allen would\r\nbe a little more particular about how he handled slights and insults\r\nand maltreatment around amongst the boarders.\r\n\r\n\r\np135.jpg (28K)\r\n\r\nTracy was a hero now, and exceedingly popular. Perhaps nobody had ever\r\nbeen quite so popular on that upper floor before. But if being\r\ndiscountenanced by these young fellows had been hard to bear, their\r\nlavish commendations and approval and hero-worship were harder still to\r\nendure. He felt degraded, but he did not allow himself to analyze the\r\nreasons why, too closely. He was content to satisfy himself with the\r\nsuggestion that he looked upon himself as degraded by the public\r\nspectacle which he had made of himself, fighting on a tin roof, for the\r\ndelectation of everybody a block or two around. But he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t entirely\r\nsatisfied with that explanation of it. Once he went a little too far\r\nand wrote in his diary that his case was worse than that of the\r\nprodigal son. He said the prodigal son merely fed swine, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nto chum with them. But he struck that out, and said \xe2\x80\x9cAll men are equal.\r\nI will not disown my principles. These men are as good as I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy was become popular on the lower floors also. Everybody was\r\ngrateful for Allen\xe2\x80\x99s reduction to the ranks, and for his transformation\r\nfrom a doer of outrages to a mere threatener of them. The young girls,\r\nof whom there were half a dozen, showed many attentions to Tracy,\r\nparticularly that boarding house pet Hattie, the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\r\nShe said to him, very sweetly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99re ever so nice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd when he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad you think so, Miss Hattie,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, still\r\nmore sweetly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t call me Miss Hattie\xe2\x80\x94call me Puss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAh, here was promotion! He had struck the summit. There were no higher\r\nheights to climb in that boarding house. His popularity was complete.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of people, Tracy showed a tranquil outside, but his\r\nheart was being eaten out of him by distress and despair.\r\n\r\nIn a little while he should be out of money, and then what should he\r\ndo? He wished, now, that he had borrowed a little more liberally from\r\nthat stranger\xe2\x80\x99s store. He found it impossible to sleep. A single\r\ntorturing, terrifying thought went racking round and round in his head,\r\nwearing a groove in his brain: What should he do\xe2\x80\x94What was to become of\r\nhim? And along with it began to intrude a something presently which was\r\nvery like a wish that he had not joined the great and noble ranks of\r\nmartyrdom, but had stayed at home and been content to be merely an earl\r\nand nothing better, with nothing more to do in this world of a useful\r\nsort than an earl finds to do. But he smothered that part of his\r\nthought as well as he could; he made every effort to drive it away, and\r\nwith fair success, but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep it from intruding a little now\r\nand then, and when it intruded it came suddenly and nipped him like a\r\nbite, a sting, a burn. He recognized that thought by the peculiar\r\nsharpness of its pang. The others were painful enough, but that one cut\r\nto the quick when it came. Night after night he lay tossing to the\r\nmusic of the hideous snoring of the honest bread-winners until two and\r\nthree o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, then got up and took refuge on the roof,\r\nwhere he sometimes got a nap and sometimes failed entirely. His\r\nappetite was leaving him and the zest of life was going along with it.\r\nFinally, one day, being near the imminent verge of total\r\ndiscouragement, he said to himself\xe2\x80\x94and took occasion to blush privately\r\nwhen he said it, \xe2\x80\x9cIf my father knew what my American name is,\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x94well,\r\nmy duty to my father rather _requires_ that I furnish him my name. I\r\nhave no right to make his days and nights unhappy, I can do enough\r\nunhappiness for the family all by myself. Really he ought to know what\r\nmy American name is.\xe2\x80\x9d He thought over it a while and framed a cablegram\r\nin his mind to this effect:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy American name is Howard Tracy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be suggesting anything. His father could understand that\r\nas he chose, and doubtless he would understand it as it was meant, as a\r\ndutiful and affectionate desire on the part of a son to make his old\r\nfather happy for a moment. Continuing his train of thought, Tracy said\r\nto himself, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, but if he should cable me to come home! I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo that\xe2\x80\x94I _mustn\xe2\x80\x99t_ do that. I\xe2\x80\x99ve started out on a mission, and I\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t turn my back on it in cowardice. No, no, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go home,\r\nat\xe2\x80\x94at\xe2\x80\x94least I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go home.\xe2\x80\x9d After a reflective pause:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, maybe\xe2\x80\x94perhaps\xe2\x80\x94it would be my _duty_ to go in the circumstances;\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s very old and he does need me by him to stay his footsteps down the\r\nlong hill that inclines westward toward the sunset of his life. Well,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll think about that. Yes, of course it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be right to stay\r\nhere. If I\xe2\x80\x94well, perhaps I could just drop him a line and put it off a\r\nlittle while and satisfy him in that way. It would be\xe2\x80\x94well, it would\r\nmar everything to have him require me to come instantly.\xe2\x80\x9d Another\r\nreflective pause\xe2\x80\x94then: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet if he should do that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nbut\xe2\x80\x94oh, dear me\xe2\x80\x94_home!_ how good it sounds! and a body is excusable for\r\nwanting to see his home again, now and then, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went to one of the telegraph offices in the avenue and got the first\r\nend of what Barrow called the \xe2\x80\x9cusual Washington courtesy,\xe2\x80\x9d where \xe2\x80\x9cthey\r\ntreat you as a tramp until they find out you\xe2\x80\x99re a congressman, and then\r\nthey slobber all over you.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a boy of seventeen on duty there,\r\ntying his shoe. He had his foot on a chair and his back turned toward\r\nthe wicket. He glanced over his shoulder, took Tracy\xe2\x80\x99s measure, turned\r\nback, and went on tying his shoe. Tracy finished writing his telegram\r\nand waited, still waited, and still waited, for that performance to\r\nfinish, but there didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be any finish to it; so finally Tracy\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you take my telegram?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth looked over his shoulder and said, by his manner, not his\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think you could wait a minute, if you tried?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever, he got the shoe tied at last, and came and took the telegram,\r\nglanced over it, then looked up surprised, at Tracy. There was\r\nsomething in his look that bordered upon respect, almost reverence, it\r\nseemed to Tracy, although he had been so long without anything of this\r\nkind he was not sure that he knew the signs of it.\r\n\r\nThe boy read the address aloud, with pleased expression in face and\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Earl of Rossmore! Cracky! Do you know him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that so! Does he know you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I swear! Will he answer you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill he though? Where\xe2\x80\x99ll you have it sent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nowhere. I\xe2\x80\x99ll call here and get it. When shall I call?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll send it to you. Where shall I send it? Give me\r\nyour address; I\xe2\x80\x99ll send it to you soon\xe2\x80\x99s it comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Tracy didn\xe2\x80\x99t propose to do this. He had acquired the boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nadmiration and deferential respect, and he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t willing to throw\r\nthese precious things away, a result sure to follow if he should give\r\nthe address of that boarding house. So he said again that he would call\r\nand get the telegram, and went his way.\r\n\r\nHe idled along, reflecting. He said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cThere _is_ something\r\npleasant about being respected. I have acquired the respect of Mr.\r\nAllen and some of those others, and almost the deference of some of\r\nthem on pure merit, for having thrashed Allen. While their respect and\r\ntheir deference\xe2\x80\x94if it is deference\xe2\x80\x94is pleasant, a deference based upon\r\na sham, a shadow, does really seem pleasanter still. It\xe2\x80\x99s no real merit\r\nto be in correspondence with an earl, and yet after all, that boy makes\r\nme feel as if there was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cablegram was actually gone home! the thought of it gave him an\r\nimmense uplift. He walked with a lighter tread. His heart was full of\r\nhappiness. He threw aside all hesitances and confessed to himself that\r\nhe was glad through and through that he was going to give up this\r\nexperiment and go back to his home again. His eagerness to get his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s answer began to grow, now, and it grew with marvelous\r\ncelerity, after it began. He waited an hour, walking about, putting in\r\nhis time as well as he could, but interested in nothing that came under\r\nhis eye, and at last he presented himself at the office again and asked\r\nif any answer had come yet. The boy said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no answer yet,\xe2\x80\x9d then glanced at the clock and added, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink it\xe2\x80\x99s likely you\xe2\x80\x99ll get one to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see it\xe2\x80\x99s getting pretty late. You can\xe2\x80\x99t always tell where\r\n\xe2\x80\x99bouts a man is when he\xe2\x80\x99s on the other side, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t always find\r\nhim just the minute you want him, and you see it\xe2\x80\x99s getting about six\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock now, and over there it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty late at night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tracy, \xe2\x80\x9cI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, pretty late, now, half past ten or eleven. Oh yes, you probably\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t get any answer to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo Tracy went home to supper. The odors in that supper room seemed more\r\nstrenuous and more horrible than ever before, and he was happy in the\r\nthought that he was so soon to be free from them again. When the supper\r\nwas over he hardly knew whether he had eaten any of it or not, and he\r\ncertainly hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard any of the conversation. His heart had been\r\ndancing all the time, his thoughts had been faraway from these things,\r\nand in the visions of his mind the sumptuous appointments of his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s castle had risen before him without rebuke. Even the plushed\r\nflunkey, that walking symbol of a sham inequality, had not been\r\nunpleasant to his dreaming view. After the meal Barrow said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome with me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a jolly evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. Where are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo my club.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat club is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMechanics\xe2\x80\x99 Debating Club.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\np144.jpg (33K)\r\n\r\nTracy shuddered, slightly. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything about having visited\r\nthat place himself. Somehow he didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite relish the memory of that\r\ntime. The sentiments which had made his former visit there so\r\nenjoyable, and filled him with such enthusiasm, had undergone a gradual\r\nchange, and they had rotted away to such a degree that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncontemplate another visit there with anything strongly resembling\r\ndelight. In fact he was a little ashamed to go; he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go\r\nthere and find out by the rude impact of the thought of those people\r\nupon his reorganized condition of mind, how sharp the change had been.\r\nHe would have preferred to stay away. He expected that now he should\r\nhear nothing except sentiments which would be a reproach to him in his\r\nchanged mental attitude, and he rather wished he might be excused. And\r\nyet he didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite want to say that, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to show how he did\r\nfeel, or show any disinclination to go, and so he forced himself to go\r\nalong with Barrow, privately purposing to take an early opportunity to\r\nget away.\r\n\r\nAfter the essayist of the evening had read his paper, the chairman\r\nannounced that the debate would now be upon the subject of the previous\r\nmeeting, \xe2\x80\x9cThe American Press.\xe2\x80\x9d It saddened the backsliding disciple to\r\nhear this announcement. It brought up too many reminiscences. He wished\r\nhe had happened upon some other subject. But the debate began, and he\r\nsat still and listened.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the discussion one of the speakers\xe2\x80\x94a blacksmith named\r\nTompkins arraigned all monarchs and all lords in the earth for their\r\ncold selfishness in retaining their unearned dignities. He said that no\r\nmonarch and no son of a monarch, no lord and no son of a lord ought to\r\nbe able to look his fellow man in the face without shame. Shame for\r\nconsenting to keep his unearned titles, property, and privileges\xe2\x80\x94at the\r\nexpense of other people; shame for consenting to remain, on any terms,\r\nin dishonourable possession of these things, which represented bygone\r\nrobberies and wrongs inflicted upon the general people of the nation.\r\nHe said, \xe2\x80\x9cif there were a lord or the son of a lord here, I would like\r\nto reason with him, and try to show him how unfair and how selfish his\r\nposition is. I would try to persuade him to relinquish it, take his\r\nplace among men on equal terms, earn the bread he eats, and hold of\r\nslight value all deference paid him because of artificial position, all\r\nreverence not the just due of his own personal merits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy seemed to be listening to utterances of his own made in talks\r\nwith his radical friends in England. It was as if some eavesdropping\r\nphonograph had treasured up his words and brought them across the\r\nAtlantic to accuse him with them in the hour of his defection and\r\nretreat. Every word spoken by this stranger seemed to leave a blister\r\non Tracy\xe2\x80\x99s conscience, and by the time the speech was finished he felt\r\nthat he was all conscience and one blister. This man\xe2\x80\x99s deep compassion\r\nfor the enslaved and oppressed millions in Europe who had to bear with\r\nthe contempt of that small class above them, throned upon shining\r\nheights whose paths were shut against them, was the very thing he had\r\noften uttered himself. The pity in this man\xe2\x80\x99s voice and words was the\r\nvery twin of the pity that used to reside in his own heart and come\r\nfrom his own lips when he thought of these oppressed peoples.\r\n\r\nThe homeward tramp was accomplished in brooding silence. It was a\r\nsilence most grateful to Tracy\xe2\x80\x99s feelings. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have broken it\r\nfor anything; for he was ashamed of himself all the way through to his\r\nspine. He kept saying to himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow unanswerable it all is\xe2\x80\x94how absolutely unanswerable! It is basely,\r\ndegradingly selfish to keep those unearned honors, and\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94oh, hang it,\r\nnobody but a cur\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an idiotic damned speech that Tompkins made!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis outburst was from Barrow. It flooded Tracy\xe2\x80\x99s demoralized soul with\r\nwaters of refreshment. These were the darlingest words the poor\r\nvacillating young apostate had ever heard\xe2\x80\x94for they whitewashed his\r\nshame for him, and that is a good service to have when you can\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nthe best of all verdicts, self-acquittal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome up to my room and smoke a pipe, Tracy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy had been expecting this invitation, and had had his declination\r\nall ready: but he was glad enough to accept, now. Was it possible that\r\na reasonable argument could be made against that man\xe2\x80\x99s desolating\r\nspeech? He was burning to hear Barrow try it. He knew how to start him,\r\nand keep him going: it was to seem to combat his positions\xe2\x80\x94a process\r\neffective with most people.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it you object to in Tompkins\xe2\x80\x99s speech, Barrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the leaving out of the factor of human nature; requiring another\r\nman to do what you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy here\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean; it\xe2\x80\x99s very simple. Tompkins is a blacksmith;\r\nhas a family; works for wages; and hard, too\xe2\x80\x94fooling around won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfurnish the bread. Suppose it should turn out that by the death of\r\nsomebody in England he is suddenly an earl\xe2\x80\x94income, half a million\r\ndollars a year. What would he do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x94I suppose he would have to decline to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMan, he would grab it in a second!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really think he would?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink?\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anything about it, I know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Because he\xe2\x80\x99s not a fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you think that if he were a fool, he\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t. Fool or _no_ fool, he would grab it. Anybody would.\r\nAnybody that\xe2\x80\x99s alive. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen dead people that would get up and\r\ngo for it. I would myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\np148.jpg (24K)\r\n\r\nThis was balm, this was healing, this was rest and peace and comfort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought you were opposed to nobilities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTransmissible ones, yes. But that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing. I\xe2\x80\x99m opposed to\r\nmillionaires, but it would be dangerous to offer me the position.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d take it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would leave the funeral of my dearest enemy to go and assume its\r\nburdens and responsibilities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy thought a while, then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I quite get the bearings of your position. You say\r\nyou are opposed to hereditary nobilities, and yet if you had the chance\r\nyou would\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake one? In a minute I would. And there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a mechanic in that\r\nentire club that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a lawyer, doctor, editor,\r\nauthor, tinker, loafer, railroad president, saint\xe2\x80\x94land, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nhuman _being_ in the United States that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t jump at the chance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcept me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tracy softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcept you!\xe2\x80\x9d Barrow could hardly get the words out, his scorn so\r\nchoked him. And he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get any further than that form of words; it\r\nseemed to dam his flow, utterly. He got up and came and glared upon\r\nTracy in a kind of outraged and unappeasable way, and said again,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcept _you!_\xe2\x80\x9d He walked around him\xe2\x80\x94inspecting him from one point of\r\nview and then another, and relieving his soul now and then by exploding\r\nthat formula at him; \xe2\x80\x9cExcept _you!_\xe2\x80\x9d Finally he slumped down into his\r\nchair with the air of one who gives it up, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s straining his viscera and he\xe2\x80\x99s breaking his heart trying to get\r\nsome low-down job that a good dog wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have, and yet wants to let\r\non that if he had a chance to scoop an earldom he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\r\nTracy, don\xe2\x80\x99t put this kind of a strain on me. Lately I\xe2\x80\x99m not as strong\r\nas I was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t meaning to put\xe2\x80\x94a strain on you, Barrow, I was only\r\nmeaning to intimate that if an earldom ever does fall in my way\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x94I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give myself any worry about _that_, if I was you. And\r\nbesides, I can settle what you would do. Are you any different from\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you any better than me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO,\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94why, certainly not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you as _good?_ Come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I\xe2\x80\x94the fact is you take me so suddenly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly? What is there sudden about it? It isn\xe2\x80\x99t a difficult question\r\nis it? Or doubtful? Just measure us on the only fair lines\xe2\x80\x94the lines of\r\nmerit\xe2\x80\x94and of course you\xe2\x80\x99ll admit that a journeyman chairmaker that\r\nearns his twenty dollars a week, and has had the good and genuine\r\nculture of contact with men, and care, and hardship, and failure, and\r\nsuccess, and downs and ups and ups and downs, is just a trifle the\r\nsuperior of a young fellow like you, who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to do\r\nanything that\xe2\x80\x99s valuable, can\xe2\x80\x99t earn his living in any secure and\r\nsteady way, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had any experience of life and its seriousness,\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t any culture but the artificial culture of books, which adorns\r\nbut doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really educate\xe2\x80\x94come! if _I_ wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t scorn an earldom, what\r\nthe devil right have _you_ to do it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy dissembled his joy, though he wanted to thank the chair-maker for\r\nthat last remark. Presently a thought struck him, and he spoke up\r\nbriskly and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut look here, I really can\xe2\x80\x99t quite get the hang of your notions\xe2\x80\x94your\r\nprinciples, if they are principles. You are inconsistent. You are\r\nopposed to aristocracies, yet you\xe2\x80\x99d take an earldom if you could. Am I\r\nto understand that you don\xe2\x80\x99t blame an earl for being and remaining an\r\nearl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t blame Tompkins, or yourself, or me, or anybody, for\r\naccepting an earldom if it was offered?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, whom _would_ you blame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole nation\xe2\x80\x94any bulk and mass of population anywhere, in any\r\ncountry, that will put up with the infamy, the outrage, the insult of a\r\nhereditary aristocracy which _they_ can\xe2\x80\x99t enter\xe2\x80\x94and on absolutely free\r\nand equal terms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you beclouding yourself with distinctions that are not\r\ndifferences?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I am not. I am entirely clear-headed about this thing. If I\r\ncould extirpate an aristocratic system by declining its honors, _then_\r\nI should be a rascal to accept them. And if enough of the mass would\r\njoin me to make the extirpation possible, _then_ I should be a rascal\r\nto do otherwise than help in the attempt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I understand\xe2\x80\x94yes, I think I get the idea. You have no blame\r\nfor the lucky few who naturally decline to vacate the pleasant nest\r\nthey were born into, you only despise the all-powerful and stupid mass\r\nof the nation for allowing the nest to exist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, that\xe2\x80\x99s it! You _can_ get a simple thing through your head\r\nif you work at it long enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mention it. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you some sound advice: when you go\r\nback; if you find your nation up and ready to abolish that hoary\r\naffront, lend a hand; but if that isn\xe2\x80\x99t the state of things and you get\r\na chance at an earldom, don\xe2\x80\x99t you be a fool\xe2\x80\x94you take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy responded with earnestness and enthusiasm:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I live, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBarrow laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never saw such a fellow. I begin to think you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a good deal of\r\nimagination. With you, the idlest fancy freezes into a reality at a\r\nbreath. Why, you looked, then, as if it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t astonish you if you\r\ndid tumble into an earldom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy blushed. Barrow added: \xe2\x80\x9cEarldom! Oh, yes, take it, if it offers;\r\nbut meantime we\xe2\x80\x99ll go on looking around, in a modest way, and if you\r\nget a chance to superintend a sausage-stuffer at six or eight dollars a\r\nweek, you just trade off the earldom for a last year\xe2\x80\x99s almanac and\r\nstick to the sausage-stuffing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTracy went to bed happy once more, at rest in his mind once more. He\r\nhad started out on a high emprise\xe2\x80\x94that was to his credit, he argued; he\r\nhad fought the best fight he could, considering the odds against\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94that was to his credit; he had been defeated\xe2\x80\x94certainly there was\r\nnothing discreditable in that. Being defeated, he had a right to retire\r\nwith the honors of war and go back without prejudice to the position in\r\nthe world\xe2\x80\x99s society to which he had been born. Why not? even the rabid\r\nrepublican chair-maker would do that. Yes, his conscience was\r\ncomfortable once more.\r\n\r\nHe woke refreshed, happy, and eager for his cablegram. He had been born\r\nan aristocrat, he had been a democrat for a time, he was now an\r\naristocrat again. He marveled to find that this final change was not\r\nmerely intellectual, it had invaded his feeling; and he also marveled\r\nto note that this feeling seemed a good deal less artificial than any\r\nhe had entertained in his system for a long time. He could also have\r\nnoted, if he had thought of it, that his bearing had stiffened, over\r\nnight, and that his chin had lifted itself a shade. Arrived in the\r\nbasement, he was about to enter the breakfast room when he saw old\r\nMarsh in the dim light of a corner of the hall, beckoning him with his\r\nfinger to approach. The blood welled slowly up in Tracy\xe2\x80\x99s cheek, and he\r\nsaid with a grade of injured dignity almost ducal:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the purpose of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to speak to you\xe2\x80\x94in private.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis spot is private enough for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarsh was surprised; and not particularly pleased. He approached and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, in public, then, if you prefer. Though it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been my way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boarders gathered to the spot, interested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tracy. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94forgot something?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99re not? Now you stop and think, a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI refuse to stop and think. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t interest me. If it interests\r\nyou, speak out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marsh, raising his voice to a slightly angry pitch,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou forgot to pay your board yesterday\xe2\x80\x94if you\xe2\x80\x99re _bound_ to have it\r\npublic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh, yes, this heir to an annual million or so had been dreaming and\r\nsoaring, and had forgotten that pitiful three or four dollars. For\r\npenalty he must have it coarsely flung in his face in the presence of\r\nthese people\xe2\x80\x94people in whose countenances was already beginning to dawn\r\nan uncharitable enjoyment of the situation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs _that_ all! Take your money and give your terrors a rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy\xe2\x80\x99s hand went down into his pocket with angry decision. But\xe2\x80\x94it\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t come out. The color began to ebb out of his face. The\r\ncountenances about him showed a growing interest; and some of them a\r\nheightened satisfaction. There was an uncomfortable pause\xe2\x80\x94then he\r\nforced out, with difficulty, the words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\xe2\x80\x94been robbed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Marsh\xe2\x80\x99s eyes flamed up with Spanish fire, and he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRobbed, is it? _That\xe2\x80\x99s_ your tune? It\xe2\x80\x99s too old\xe2\x80\x94been played in this\r\nhouse too often; everybody plays it that can\xe2\x80\x99t get work when he wants\r\nit, and won\xe2\x80\x99t work when he can get it. Trot out Mr. Allen, somebody,\r\nand let _him_ take a toot at it. It\xe2\x80\x99s _his_ turn next, _he_ forgot,\r\ntoo, last night. I\xe2\x80\x99m laying for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the negro women came scrambling down stairs as pale as a sorrel\r\nhorse with consternation and excitement:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMisto Marsh, Misto Allen\xe2\x80\x99s skipped out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes-sah, and cleaned out his room _clean;_ tuck bofe towels en de\r\nsoap!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou lie, you hussy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s jes\xe2\x80\x99 so, jes\xe2\x80\x99 as I tells you\xe2\x80\x94en Misto Summer\xe2\x80\x99s socks is gone, en\r\nMisto Naylor\xe2\x80\x99s yuther shirt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Marsh was at boiling point by this time. He turned upon Tracy:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnswer up now\xe2\x80\x94when are you going to settle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-day\xe2\x80\x94since you seem to be in a hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_To-day_ is it? Sunday\xe2\x80\x94and you out of work? I like that. Come\xe2\x80\x94where\r\nare you going to get the money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy\xe2\x80\x99s spirit was rising again. He proposed to impress these people:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am expecting a cablegram from home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Marsh was caught out, with the surprise of it. The idea was so\r\nimmense, so extravagant, that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get his breath at first. When\r\nhe did get it, it came rancid with sarcasm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA _cablegram_\xe2\x80\x94think of it, ladies and gents, he\xe2\x80\x99s expecting a\r\ncablegram! _He\xe2\x80\x99s_ expecting a cablegram\xe2\x80\x94this duffer, this scrub, this\r\nbilk! From his father\xe2\x80\x94eh? Yes\xe2\x80\x94without a doubt. A dollar or two a\r\nword\xe2\x80\x94oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\xe2\x80\x94_they_ don\xe2\x80\x99t mind a little thing like\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94_this_ kind\xe2\x80\x99s fathers don\xe2\x80\x99t. Now his father is\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94well, I reckon\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father is an English earl!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe crowd fell back aghast-aghast at the sublimity of the young\r\nloafer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccheek.\xe2\x80\x9d Then they burst into a laugh that made the windows\r\nrattle. Tracy was too angry to realize that he had done a foolish\r\nthing. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand aside, please. I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute, your lordship,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marsh, bowing low, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere is your\r\nlordship going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the cablegram. Let me pass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, your lordship, you\xe2\x80\x99ll stay right where you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t begin to keep boarding-house yesterday. It means\r\nthat I am not the kind that can be taken in by every hack-driver\xe2\x80\x99s son\r\nthat comes loafing over here because he can\xe2\x80\x99t bum a living at home. It\r\nmeans that you can\xe2\x80\x99t skip out on any such\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy made a step toward the old man, but Mrs. Marsh sprang between,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, Mr. Tracy, please.\xe2\x80\x9d She turned to her husband and said, \xe2\x80\x9c_Do_\r\nbridle your tongue. What has he done to be treated so? Can\xe2\x80\x99t you _see_\r\nhe has lost his mind, with trouble and distress? He\xe2\x80\x99s not responsible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank your kind heart, madam, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve not lost my mind; and if I can\r\nhave the mere privilege of stepping to the telegraph office\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Marsh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94or sending\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSending! That beats everything. If there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody that\xe2\x80\x99s fool enough\r\nto go on such a chuckle-headed errand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere comes Mr. Barrow\xe2\x80\x94he will go for me. Barrow\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA brisk fire of exclamations broke out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Barrow, he\xe2\x80\x99s expecting a cablegram!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCablegram from his father, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94cablegram from the wax-figger!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd say, Barrow, this fellow\xe2\x80\x99s an earl\xe2\x80\x94take off your hat, pull down\r\nyour vest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he\xe2\x80\x99s come off and forgot his crown, that he wears Sundays. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncabled over to his pappy to send it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou step out and get that cablegram, Barrow; his majesty\xe2\x80\x99s a little\r\nlame to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh stop,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Barrow; \xe2\x80\x9cgive the man a chance.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned, and said\r\nwith some severity, \xe2\x80\x9cTracy, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you? What kind of\r\nfoolishness is this you\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking. You ought to have more sense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve not been talking foolishness; and if you\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the telegraph\r\noffice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh; don\xe2\x80\x99t talk so. I\xe2\x80\x99m your friend in trouble and out of it, before\r\nyour face and behind your back, for anything in _reason;_ but you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nlost your head, you see, and this moonshine about a cablegram\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ go there and ask for it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you from the bottom of my heart, Brady. Here, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a\r\nWritten order for it. Fly, now, and fetch it. We\xe2\x80\x99ll soon see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrady flew. Immediately the sort of quiet began to steal over the crowd\r\nwhich means dawning doubt, misgiving; and might be translated into the\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe he _is_ expecting a cablegram\xe2\x80\x94maybe he _has_ got a father\r\nsomewhere\xe2\x80\x94maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ve been just a little too fresh, just a shade too\r\n\xe2\x80\x98previous\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLoud talk ceased; then the mutterings and low murmurings and\r\nwhisperings died out. The crowd began to crumble apart. By ones and\r\ntwos the fragments drifted to the breakfast table. Barrow tried to\r\nbring Tracy in; but he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet, Barrow\xe2\x80\x94presently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Marsh and Hattie tried, offering gentle and kindly persuasions;\r\nbut he said;\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather wait\xe2\x80\x94till he comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven old Marsh began to have suspicions that maybe he had been a trifle\r\ntoo \xe2\x80\x9cbrash,\xe2\x80\x9d as he called it in the privacy of his soul, and he pulled\r\nhimself together and started toward Tracy with invitation in his eyes;\r\nbut Tracy warned him off with a gesture which was quite positive and\r\neloquent. Then followed the stillest quarter of an hour which had ever\r\nbeen known in that house at that time of day. It was so still, and so\r\nsolemn withal, that when somebody\xe2\x80\x99s cup slipped from his fingers and\r\nlanded in his plate the shock made people start, and the sharp sound\r\nseemed as indecorous there and as out of place as if a coffin and\r\nmourners were imminent and being waited for. And at last when Brady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeet came clattering down the stairs the sacrilege seemed unbearable.\r\nEverybody rose softly and turned toward the door, where stood Tracy;\r\nthen with a common impulse, moved a step or two in that direction, and\r\nstopped. While they gazed, young Brady arrived, panting, and put into\r\nTracy\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\xe2\x80\x94sure enough\xe2\x80\x94an envelope. Tracy fastened a bland\r\nvictorious eye upon the gazers, and kept it there till one by one they\r\ndropped their eyes, vanquished and embarrassed. Then he tore open the\r\ntelegram and glanced at its message. The yellow paper fell from his\r\nfingers and fluttered to the floor, and his face turned white. There\r\nwas nothing there but one word\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Thanks_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe humorist of the house, the tall, raw-boned Billy Nash, caulker from\r\nthe navy yard, was standing in the rear of the crowd. In the midst of\r\nthe pathetic silence that was now brooding over the place and moving\r\nsome few hearts there toward compassion, he began to whimper, then he\r\nput his handkerchief to his eyes and buried his face in the neck of the\r\nbashfulest young fellow in the company, a navy-yard blacksmith,\r\nshrieked \xe2\x80\x9cOh, pappy, how _could_ you!\xe2\x80\x9d and began to bawl like a\r\nteething baby, if one may imagine a baby with the energy and the\r\ndevastating voice of a jackass.\r\n\r\nSo perfect was that imitation of a child\xe2\x80\x99s cry, and so vast the scale\r\nof it and so ridiculous the aspect of the performer, that all gravity\r\nwas swept from the place as if by a hurricane, and almost everybody\r\nthere joined in the crash of laughter provoked by the exhibition. Then\r\nthe small mob began to take its revenge\xe2\x80\x94revenge for the discomfort and\r\napprehension it had brought upon itself by its own too rash freshness\r\nof a little while before. It guyed its poor victim, baited him, worried\r\nhim, as dogs do with a cornered cat. The victim answered back with\r\ndefiances and challenges which included everybody, and which only gave\r\nthe sport new spirit and variety; but when he changed his tactics and\r\nbegan to single out individuals and invite them by name, the fun lost\r\nits funniness and the interest of the show died out, along with the\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\nFinally Marsh was about to take an innings, but Barrow said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, now\xe2\x80\x94leave him alone. You\xe2\x80\x99ve no account with him but a\r\nmoney account. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of that myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe distressed and worried landlady gave Barrow a fervently grateful\r\nlook for his championship of the abused stranger; and the pet of the\r\nhouse, a very prism in her cheap but ravishing Sunday rig, blew him a\r\nkiss from the tips of her fingers and said, with the darlingest smile\r\nand a sweet little toss of her head:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re the only man here, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to set my cap for you, you\r\ndear old thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor shame, Puss! How you talk! I _never_ saw such a child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt took a good deal of argument and persuasion\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, petting,\r\nunder these disguises\xe2\x80\x94to get Tracy to entertain the idea of breakfast.\r\nHe at first said he would never eat again in that house; and added that\r\nhe had enough firmness of character, he trusted, to enable him to\r\nstarve like a man when the alternative was to eat insult with his\r\nbread.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished his breakfast, Barrow took him to his room,\r\nfurnished him a pipe, and said cheerily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Now_, old fellow, take in your battle-flag out of the wet, you\xe2\x80\x99re not\r\nin the hostile camp any more. You\xe2\x80\x99re a little upset by your troubles,\r\nand that\xe2\x80\x99s natural enough, but don\xe2\x80\x99t let your mind run on them anymore\r\nthan you can help; drag your thoughts away from your troubles by the\r\nears, by the heels, or any other way, so you manage it; it\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nhealthiest thing a body can do; dwelling on troubles is deadly, just\r\ndeadly\xe2\x80\x94and that\xe2\x80\x99s the softest name there is for it. You must keep your\r\nmind amused\xe2\x80\x94you must, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, miserable me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Don\xe2\x80\x99t!_ There\xe2\x80\x99s just pure heart-break in that tone. It\xe2\x80\x99s just as I\r\nsay; you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get right down to it and amuse your mind, as if it\r\nwas salvation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re easy words to say, Barrow, but how am I going to amuse,\r\nentertain, divert a mind that finds itself suddenly assaulted and\r\noverwhelmed by disasters of a sort not dreamed of and not provided for?\r\nNo\xe2\x80\x94no, the bare idea of amusement is repulsive to my feelings: Let us\r\ntalk of death and funerals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94not yet. That would be giving up the ship. We\xe2\x80\x99ll not give up the\r\nship yet. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to amuse you; I sent Brady out for the wherewithal\r\nbefore you finished breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did? What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, this is a good sign\xe2\x80\x94curiosity. Oh, there\xe2\x80\x99s hope for you yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrady arrived with a box, and departed, after saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nfinishing one up, but they\xe2\x80\x99ll be along as soon as it\xe2\x80\x99s done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBarrow took a frameless oil portrait a foot square from the box, set it\r\nup in a good light, without comment, and reached for another, taking a\r\nfurtive glance at Tracy, meantime. The stony solemnity in Tracy\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nremained as it was, and gave out no sign of interest. Barrow placed the\r\nsecond portrait beside the first, and stole another glance while\r\nreaching for a third. The stone image softened, a shade. No. 3 forced\r\nthe ghost of a smile, No. 4 swept indifference wholly away, and No. 5\r\nstarted a laugh which was still in good and hearty condition when No.\r\n14 took its place in the row.\r\n\r\n\r\np162.jpg (17K)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _you\xe2\x80\x99re_ all right, yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Barrow. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see you\xe2\x80\x99re not past\r\namusement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe pictures were fearful, as to color, and atrocious as to drawing and\r\nexpression; but the feature which squelched animosity and made them\r\nfunny was a feature which could not achieve its full force in a single\r\npicture, but required the wonder-working assistance of repetition. One\r\nloudly dressed mechanic in stately attitude, with his hand on a cannon,\r\nashore, and a ship riding at anchor in the offing,\xe2\x80\x94this is merely odd;\r\nbut when one sees the same cannon and the same ship in fourteen\r\npictures in a row, and a different mechanic standing watch in each, the\r\nthing gets to be funny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExplain\xe2\x80\x94explain these aberrations,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tracy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they are not the achievement of a single intellect, a single\r\ntalent\xe2\x80\x94it takes two to do these miracles. They are collaborations; the\r\none artist does the figure, the other the accessories. The\r\nfigure-artist is a German shoemaker with an untaught passion for art,\r\nthe other is a simple hearted old Yankee sailor-man whose possibilities\r\nare strictly limited to his ship, his cannon and his patch of petrified\r\nsea. They work these things up from twenty-five-cent tintypes; they get\r\nsix dollars apiece for them, and they can grind out a couple a day when\r\nthey strike what they call a boost\xe2\x80\x94that is, an inspiration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople actually pay money for these calumnies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey actually do\xe2\x80\x94and quite willingly, too. And these abortionists\r\ncould double their trade and work the women in, if Capt. Saltmarsh\r\ncould whirl a horse in, or a piano, or a guitar, in place of his\r\ncannon. The fact is, he fatigues the market with that cannon. Even the\r\nmale market, I mean. These fourteen in the procession are not all\r\nsatisfied. One is an old \xe2\x80\x98independent\xe2\x80\x99 fireman, and he wants an engine\r\nin place of the cannon; another is a mate of a tug, and wants a tug in\r\nplace of the ship \xe2\x80\x94and so on, and so on. But the captain can\xe2\x80\x99t make a\r\ntug that is deceptive, and a fire engine is many flights beyond his\r\npower.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis _is_ a most extraordinary form of robbery, I never have heard of\r\nanything like it. It\xe2\x80\x99s interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and so are the artists. They are perfectly honest men, and\r\nsincere. And the old sailor-man is full of sound religion, and is as\r\ndevoted a student of the Bible and misquoter of it as you can find\r\nanywhere. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know a better man or kinder hearted old soul than\r\nSaltmarsh, although he does swear a little, sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seems to be perfect. I want to know him, Barrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have the chance. I guess I hear them coming, now. We\xe2\x80\x99ll draw\r\nthem out on their art, if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe artists arrived and shook hands with great heartiness. The German\r\nwas forty and a little fleshy, with a shiny bald head and a kindly face\r\nand deferential manner. Capt. Saltmarsh was sixty, tall, erect,\r\npowerfully built, with coal-black hair and whiskers, and he had a well\r\ntanned complexion, and a gait and countenance that were full of\r\ncommand, confidence and decision. His horny hands and wrists were\r\ncovered with tattoo-marks, and when his lips parted, his teeth showed\r\nup white and blemishless. His voice was the effortless deep bass of a\r\nchurch organ, and would disturb the tranquility of a gas flame fifty\r\nyards away.\r\n\r\n\r\np165.jpg (16K)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re wonderful pictures,\xe2\x80\x9d said Barrow. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been examining them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very bleasant dot you like dem,\xe2\x80\x9d said Handel, the German,\r\ngreatly pleased. \xe2\x80\x9cUnd you, Herr Tracy, you haf peen bleased mit dem\r\ntoo, alretty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can honestly say I have never seen anything just like them before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSch\xc3\xb6n!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the German, delighted. \xe2\x80\x9cYou hear, Gaptain? Here is a\r\nchentleman, yes, vot abbreviate unser aart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain was charmed, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, we\xe2\x80\x99re thankful for a compliment yet, though they\xe2\x80\x99re not as\r\nscarce now as they used to be before we made a reputation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGetting the reputation is the up-hill time in most things, captain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t enough to know how to reef a gasket, you got to make\r\nthe mate know you know it. That\xe2\x80\x99s reputation. The good word, said at\r\nthe right time, that\xe2\x80\x99s the word that makes us; and evil be to him that\r\nevil thinks, as Isaiah says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very relevant, and hits the point exactly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tracy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you study art, Captain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t studied; it\xe2\x80\x99s a natural gift.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is born mit dose cannon in him. He tondt haf to do noding, his\r\nchenius do all de vork. Of he is asleep, and take a pencil in his hand,\r\nout come a cannon. Py crashus, of he could do a clavier, of he could do\r\na guitar, of he could do a vashtub, it is a fortune, heiliger Yohanniss\r\nit is yoost a fortune!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is an immense pity that the business is hindered and limited\r\nin this unfortunate way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain grew a trifle excited, himself, now:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve said it, Mr. Tracy!\xe2\x80\x94Hindered? well, I should say so. Why, look\r\nhere. This fellow here, No. 11, he\xe2\x80\x99s a hackman,\xe2\x80\x94a flourishing hackman,\r\nI may say. He wants his hack in this picture. Wants it where the cannon\r\nis. I got around that difficulty, by telling him the cannon\xe2\x80\x99s our\r\ntrademark, so to speak\xe2\x80\x94proves that the picture\xe2\x80\x99s our work, and I was\r\nafraid if we left it out people wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know for certain if it _was_ a\r\nSaltmarsh\xe2\x80\x94Handel\xe2\x80\x94now you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t yourself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Captain? You wrong yourself, indeed you do. Anyone who has once\r\nseen a genuine Saltmarsh-Handel is safe from imposture forever. Strip\r\nit, flay it, skin it out of every detail but the bare color and\r\nexpression, and that man will still recognize it\xe2\x80\x94still stop to\r\nworship\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how it makes me feel to hear dose oxpressions!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cstill say to himself again as he had, said a hundred times before,\r\nthe art of the Saltmarsh-Handel is an art apart, there is nothing in\r\nthe heavens above or in the earth beneath that resembles it,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPy chiminy, nur h\xc3\xb6ren Sie einmal! In my life day haf I never heard so\r\nbrecious worts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I talked him out of the hack, Mr. Tracy, and he let up on that, and\r\nsaid put in a hearse, then\xe2\x80\x94because he\xe2\x80\x99s chief mate of a hearse but\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t own it\xe2\x80\x94stands a watch for wages, you know. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t do a\r\nhearse any more than I can a hack; so here we are\xe2\x80\x94becalmed, you see.\r\nAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s the same with women and such. They come and they want a little\r\njohnry picture\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the accessories that make it a _genre?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94cannon, or cat, or any little thing like that, that you heave in\r\nto whoop up the effect. We could do a prodigious trade with the women\r\nif we could foreground the things they like, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t give a damn\r\nfor artillery. Mine\xe2\x80\x99s the lack,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the captain with a sigh,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndy\xe2\x80\x99s end of the business is all right I tell you _he\xe2\x80\x99s_ an artist\r\nfrom way back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoost hear dot old man! He always talk \xe2\x80\x99poud me like dot,\xe2\x80\x9d purred the\r\npleased German.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at his work yourself! Fourteen portraits in a row. And no two of\r\nthem alike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow that you speak of it, it is true; I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t noticed it before. It\r\nis very remarkable. Unique, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say so. That\xe2\x80\x99s the very _thing_ about Andy\xe2\x80\x94he\r\n_discriminates_. Discrimination\xe2\x80\x99s the thief of time\xe2\x80\x94forty-ninth Psalm;\r\nbut that ain\xe2\x80\x99t any matter, it\xe2\x80\x99s the honest thing, and it pays in the\r\nend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he certainly is great in that feature, one is obliged to admit\r\nit; but\xe2\x80\x94now mind, I\xe2\x80\x99m not really criticising\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you think he is just\r\na trifle overstrong in technique?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain\xe2\x80\x99s face was knocked expressionless by this remark. It\r\nremained quite vacant while he muttered to himself\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTechnique\xe2\x80\x94technique\xe2\x80\x94polytechnique\xe2\x80\x94pyro-technique; that\xe2\x80\x99s it,\r\nlikely\xe2\x80\x94fireworks too much color.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he spoke up with serenity and\r\nconfidence, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes, he does pile it on pretty loud; but they all like it, you\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94fact is, it\xe2\x80\x99s the life of the business. Take that No. 9, there,\r\nEvans the butcher. He drops into the stoodio as sober-colored as\r\nanything you ever see: _now_ look at him. You can\xe2\x80\x99t tell him from\r\nscarlet fever. Well, it pleases that butcher to death. I\xe2\x80\x99m making a\r\nstudy of a sausage-wreath to hang on the cannon, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t really\r\nreckon I can do it right, but if I can, we can break the butcher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnquestionably your confederate\xe2\x80\x94I mean your\xe2\x80\x94your fellow-craftsman\xe2\x80\x94is a\r\ngreat colorist\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, danke sch\xc3\xb6n!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cin fact a quite extraordinary colorist; a colorist, I make bold to\r\nsay, without imitator here or abroad\xe2\x80\x94and with a most bold and effective\r\ntouch, a touch like a battering ram; and a manner so peculiar and\r\nromantic, and extraneous, and ad libitum, and heart-searching,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x94he is an impressionist, I presume?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain simply, \xe2\x80\x9che is a Presbyterian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt accounts for it all\xe2\x80\x94all\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s something divine about his\r\nart,\xe2\x80\x94soulful, unsatisfactory, yearning, dim hearkening on the void\r\nhorizon, vague\xe2\x80\x94murmuring to the spirit out of ultra-marine distances\r\nand far-sounding cataclysms of uncreated space\xe2\x80\x94oh, if he\xe2\x80\x94if, he\xe2\x80\x94has he\r\never tried distemper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain answered up with energy:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if he knows himself! But his dog has, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, it vas not _my_ dog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you _said_ it was your dog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, gaptain, I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a white dog, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it, with his tail docked, and one ear gone,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDot\xe2\x80\x99s him, dot\xe2\x80\x99s him!\xe2\x80\x94der fery dog. Wy, py Chorge, dot dog he would\r\neat baint yoost de same like\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, never mind that, now\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98vast heaving\xe2\x80\x94I never saw such a man. You\r\nstart him on that dog and he\xe2\x80\x99ll dispute a year. Blamed if I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n_seen_ him keep it up a level two hours and a half.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy captain!\xe2\x80\x9d said Barrow. \xe2\x80\x9cI guess that must be hearsay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, no hearsay about it\xe2\x80\x94he disputed with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see how you stood it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\xe2\x80\x94if you run with Andy. But it\xe2\x80\x99s the only fault he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t you afraid of acquiring it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, tranquilly, \xe2\x80\x9cno danger of that, I reckon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe artists presently took their leave. Then Barrow put his hands on\r\nTracy\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook me in the eye, my boy. Steady, steady. There\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s just as I\r\nthought\xe2\x80\x94hoped, anyway; _you\xe2\x80\x99re_ all right, thank goodness. Nothing the\r\nmatter with your mind. But don\xe2\x80\x99t do that again\xe2\x80\x94even for fun. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwise. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have believed you if you\xe2\x80\x99d _been_ an earl\xe2\x80\x99s son.\r\nWhy, they _couldn\xe2\x80\x99t_\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you know that? What ever possessed you to\r\ntake such a freak? But never mind about that; let\xe2\x80\x99s not talk of it. It\r\nwas a mistake; you see that yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94it _was_ a mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, just drop it out of your mind; it\xe2\x80\x99s no harm; we all make them.\r\nPull your courage together, and don\xe2\x80\x99t brood, and don\xe2\x80\x99t give up. I\xe2\x80\x99m at\r\nyour back, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll pull through, don\xe2\x80\x99t you be afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone, Barrow walked the floor a good while, uneasy in his\r\nmind. He said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m troubled about him. He never would have\r\nmade a break like that if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been a little off his balance. But\r\nI know what being out of work and no prospect ahead can do for a man.\r\nFirst it knocks the pluck out of him and drags his pride in the dirt;\r\nworry does the rest, and his mind gets shaky. I must talk to these\r\npeople. No\xe2\x80\x94if there\xe2\x80\x99s any humanity in them\xe2\x80\x94and there is, at\r\nbottom\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99ll be easier on him if they think his troubles have\r\ndisturbed his reason. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve _got_ to find him some work; work\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nonly medicine for his disease. Poor devil! away off here, and not a\r\nfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moment Tracy was alone his spirits vanished away, and all the\r\nmisery of his situation was manifest to him. To be moneyless and an\r\nobject of the chairmaker\xe2\x80\x99s charity\xe2\x80\x94this was bad enough, but his folly\r\nin proclaiming himself an earl\xe2\x80\x99s son to that scoffing and unbelieving\r\ncrew, and, on top of that, the humiliating result\xe2\x80\x94the recollection of\r\nthese things was a sharper torture still. He made up his mind that he\r\nwould never play earl\xe2\x80\x99s son again before a doubtful audience.\r\n\r\nHis father\xe2\x80\x99s answer was a blow he could not understand. At times he\r\nthought his father imagined he could get work to do in America without\r\nany trouble, and was minded to let him try it and cure himself of his\r\nradicalism by hard, cold, disenchanting experience. That seemed the\r\nmost plausible theory, yet he could not content himself with it. A\r\ntheory that pleased him better was, that this cablegram would be\r\nfollowed by another, of a gentler sort, requiring him to come home.\r\nShould he write and strike his flag, and ask for a ticket home? Oh, no,\r\nthat he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t _ever_ do. At least, not yet. That cablegram would\r\ncome, it certainly would. So he went from one telegraph office to\r\nanother every day for nearly a week, and asked if there was a cablegram\r\nfor Howard Tracy. No, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any. So they answered him at first.\r\nLater, they said it before he had a chance to ask. Later still they\r\nmerely shook their heads impatiently as soon as he came in sight. After\r\nthat he was ashamed to go any more.\r\n\r\nHe was down in the lowest depths of despair, now; for the harder Barrow\r\ntried to find work for him the more hopeless the possibilities seemed\r\nto grow. At last he said to Barrow:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here. I want to make a confession. I have got down, now, to where\r\nI am not only willing to acknowledge to myself that I am a shabby\r\ncreature and full of false pride, but am willing to acknowledge it to\r\nyou. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been allowing you to wear yourself out hunting for work\r\nfor me when there\xe2\x80\x99s been a chance open to me all the time. Forgive my\r\npride\xe2\x80\x94what was left of it. It is all gone, now, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to\r\nconfess that if those ghastly artists want another confederate, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ntheir man\xe2\x80\x94for at last I am dead to shame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo? Really, can you paint?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot as badly as _they_. No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t claim that, for I am not a genius;\r\nin fact, I am a very indifferent amateur, a slouchy dabster, a mere\r\nartistic sarcasm; but drunk or asleep I can beat _those_ buccaneers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShake! I want to shout! Oh, I tell you, I am immensely delighted and\r\nrelieved. Oh, just to work\xe2\x80\x94that is life! No matter what the work\r\nis\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s of no consequence. Just work itself is bliss when a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen starving for it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve _been_ there! Come right along; we\xe2\x80\x99ll hunt\r\nthe old boys up. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you feel good? I tell you _I_ do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe freebooters were not at home. But their \xe2\x80\x9cworks\xe2\x80\x9d were, displayed in\r\nprofusion all about the little ratty studio. Cannon to the right of\r\nthem, cannon to the left of them, cannon in front\xe2\x80\x94it was Balaclava come\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the uncontented hackman, Tracy. Buckle to\xe2\x80\x94deepen the sea-green\r\nto turf, turn the ship into a hearse. Let the boys have a taste of your\r\nquality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe artists arrived just as the last touch was put on. They stood\r\ntransfixed with admiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy souls but she\xe2\x80\x99s a stunner, that hearse! The hackman will just go\r\nall to pieces when he sees that won\xe2\x80\x99t he Andy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is sphlennid, sphlennid! Herr Tracy, why haf you not said you\r\nvas a so sublime aartist? Lob\xe2\x80\x99 Gott, of you had lif\xe2\x80\x99d in Paris you\r\nwould be a Pree de Rome, dot\xe2\x80\x99s votes de matter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe arrangements were soon made. Tracy was taken into full and equal\r\npartnership, and he went straight to work, with dash and energy, to\r\nreconstructing gems of art whose accessories had failed to satisfy.\r\nUnder his hand, on that and succeeding days, artillery disappeared and\r\nthe emblems of peace and commerce took its place\xe2\x80\x94cats, hacks, sausages,\r\ntugs, fire engines, pianos, guitars, rocks, gardens, flower-pots,\r\nlandscapes\xe2\x80\x94whatever was wanted, he flung it in; and the more out of\r\nplace and absurd the required object was, the more joy he got out of\r\nfabricating it. The pirates were delighted, the customers applauded,\r\nthe sex began to flock in, great was the prosperity of the firm. Tracy\r\nwas obliged to confess to himself that there was something about\r\nwork,\xe2\x80\x94even such grotesque and humble work as this\xe2\x80\x94which most pleasantly\r\nsatisfied a something in his nature which had never been satisfied\r\nbefore, and also gave him a strange new dignity in his own private view\r\nof himself.\r\n\r\nThe Unqualified Member from Cherokee Strip was in a state of deep\r\ndejection. For a good while, now, he had been leading a sort of life\r\nwhich was calculated to kill; for it had consisted in regularly\r\nalternating days of brilliant hope and black disappointment. The\r\nbrilliant hopes were created by the magician Sellers, and they always\r\npromised that _now_ he had got the trick, sure, and would effectively\r\ninfluence that materialized cowboy to call at the Towers before night.\r\nThe black disappointments consisted in the persistent and monotonous\r\nfailure of these prophecies.\r\n\r\nAt the date which this history has now reached, Sellers was appalled to\r\nfind that the usual remedy was inoperative, and that Hawkins\xe2\x80\x99s low\r\nspirits refused absolutely to lift. Something must be done, he\r\nreflected; it was heart-breaking, this woe, this smileless misery, this\r\ndull despair that looked out from his poor friend\xe2\x80\x99s face. Yes, he must\r\nbe cheered up. He mused a while, then he saw his way. He said in his\r\nmost conspicuously casual vein:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEr\xe2\x80\x94uh\xe2\x80\x94by the way, Hawkins, we are feeling disappointed about this\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94the way the materializee is acting, I mean\xe2\x80\x94we are disappointed;\r\nyou concede that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConcede it? Why, yes, if you like the term.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; so far, so good. Now for the _basis_ of the feeling. It is\r\nnot that your heart, your affections are concerned; that is to say, it\r\nis not that you _want_ the materializee _Itself_. You concede that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I concede that, too\xe2\x80\x94cordially.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, again; we are making progress. To sum up: The feeling, it\r\nis conceded, is not engendered by the mere conduct of the materializee;\r\nit is conceded that it does not arise from any pang which the\r\n_personality_ of the materializee could assuage. Now then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nearl, with the light of triumph in his eye, \xe2\x80\x9cthe inexorable logic of\r\nthe situation narrows us down to this: our feeling has its source in\r\nthe _money_-loss involved. Come\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t that so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness knows I concede that, with all my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. When you\xe2\x80\x99ve found out the source of a disease, you\xe2\x80\x99ve also\r\nfound out what remedy is required\xe2\x80\x94just as in this case. In this case\r\nmoney is required. And _only_ money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old, old seduction was in that airy, confident tone and those\r\nsignificant words\xe2\x80\x94usually called pregnant words in books. The old\r\nanswering signs of faith and hope showed up in Hawkins\xe2\x80\x99s countenance,\r\nand he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Only_ money? Do you mean that you know a way to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWashington, have you the impression that I have no resources but those\r\nI allow the public and my intimate friends to know about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it _likely_, do you think, that a man moved by nature and taught by\r\nexperience to keep his affairs to himself and a cautious and reluctant\r\ntongue in his head, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be thoughtful enough to keep a few\r\nresources in reserve for a rainy day, when he\xe2\x80\x99s got as many as I have\r\nto select from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you make me feel so much better already, Colonel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever been in my laboratory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it. You see you didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know that I had one. Come along.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a little trick there that I want to show you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve kept it\r\nperfectly quiet, not fifty people know anything about it. But that\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nway, always been my way. Wait till you\xe2\x80\x99re _ready_, that\xe2\x80\x99s the idea; and\r\n_when_ you\xe2\x80\x99re ready, _zzip!_\xe2\x80\x94let her go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Colonel, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen a man that I\xe2\x80\x99ve had such unbounded\r\nconfidence in as you. When you say a thing right out, I always feel as\r\nif that ends it; as if that is evidence, and proof, and everything\r\nelse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old earl was profoundly pleased and touched.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad _you_ believe in me, Washington; not everybody is so just.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always have believed in you; and I always shall as long as I live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, my boy. You shan\xe2\x80\x99t repent it. And you _can\xe2\x80\x99t_.\xe2\x80\x9d Arrived in\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9claboratory,\xe2\x80\x9d the earl continued, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, cast your eye around this\r\nroom\xe2\x80\x94what do you see? _Apparently_ a junk-shop; _apparently_ a hospital\r\nconnected with a patent office\xe2\x80\x94in _reality_, the mines of Golconda in\r\ndisguise! Look at that thing there. Now what would you take that thing\r\nto be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe I could ever imagine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s my grand adaptation of the phonograph to\r\nthe marine service. You store up profanity in it for use at sea. You\r\nknow that sailors don\xe2\x80\x99t fly around worth a cent unless you swear at\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94so the mate that can do the best job of swearing is the most\r\nvaluable man. In great emergencies his talent saves the ship. But a\r\nship is a large thing, and he can\xe2\x80\x99t be everywhere at once; so there\r\nhave been times when one mate has lost a ship which could have been\r\nsaved if they had had a hundred. Prodigious storms, you know. Well, a\r\nship can\xe2\x80\x99t afford a hundred mates; but she can afford a hundred Cursing\r\nPhonographs, and distribute them all over the vessel\xe2\x80\x94and there, you\r\nsee, she\xe2\x80\x99s armed at every point. Imagine a big storm, and a hundred of\r\nmy machines all cursing away at once\xe2\x80\x94splendid spectacle, splendid!\xe2\x80\x94you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear yourself think. Ship goes through that storm perfectly\r\nserene\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s just as safe as she\xe2\x80\x99d be on shore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful idea. How do you prepare the thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLoad it\xe2\x80\x94simply load it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy you just stand over it and swear into it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat loads it, does it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94because every word it collars, it _keeps_\xe2\x80\x94keeps it forever. Never\r\nwears out. Any time you turn the crank, out it\xe2\x80\x99ll come. In times of\r\ngreat peril, you can reverse it, and it\xe2\x80\x99ll swear backwards. _That_\r\nmakes a sailor hump himself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I see. Who loads them?\xe2\x80\x94the mate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if he chooses. Or I\xe2\x80\x99ll furnish them already loaded. I can hire an\r\nexpert for $75 a month who will load a hundred and fifty phonographs in\r\n150 hours, and do it _easy_. And an expert can furnish a stronger\r\narticle, of course, than the mere average uncultivated mate could. Then\r\nyou see, all the ships of the world will buy them ready loaded\xe2\x80\x94for I\r\nshall have them loaded in any language a customer wants. Hawkins, it\r\nwill work the grandest moral reform of the 19th century. Five years\r\nfrom now, _all_ the swearing will be done by machinery\xe2\x80\x94you won\xe2\x80\x99t ever\r\nhear a profane word come from human lips on a ship. Millions of dollars\r\nhave been spent by the churches, in the effort to abolish profanity in\r\nthe commercial marine. Think of it\xe2\x80\x94my name will live forever in the\r\naffections of good men as the man, who, solitary and alone,\r\naccomplished this noble and elevating reform.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, it _is_ grand and beneficent and beautiful. How _did_ you ever come\r\nto think of it? You have a wonderful mind. How did you say you loaded\r\nthe machine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, it\xe2\x80\x99s no trouble\xe2\x80\x94perfectly simple. If you want to load it up loud\r\nand strong, you stand right over it and shout. But if you leave it open\r\nand all set, it\xe2\x80\x99ll _eavesdrop_, so to speak\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, it will\r\nload itself up with any sounds that are made within six feet of it. Now\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you how it works. I had an expert come and load this one up\r\nyesterday. Hello, it\xe2\x80\x99s been left open\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s too bad\xe2\x80\x94still I reckon it\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t had much chance to collect irrelevant stuff. All you do is to\r\npress this button in the floor\xe2\x80\x94so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe phonograph began to sing in a plaintive voice:\r\n\r\nThere is a boarding-house, far far away,\r\nWhere they have ham and eggs, 3 times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang it, _that_ ain\xe2\x80\x99t it. Somebody\xe2\x80\x99s been singing around here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe plaintive song began again, mingled with a low, gradually rising\r\nwail of cats slowly warming up toward a fight;\r\n\r\nO, _how_ the boarders yell,\r\nWhen they hear that dinner bell\r\nThey give that landlord\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n(momentary outburst of terrific catfight which drowns out one word.)\r\n\r\nThree times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Renewal of furious catfight for a moment. The plaintive voice on a\r\nhigh fierce key, \xe2\x80\x9c_Scat_, you devils\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and a racket as of flying\r\nmissiles.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, never mind\xe2\x80\x94let it go. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some sailor-profanity down in\r\nthere somewhere, if I could get to it. But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t any matter; you see\r\nhow the machine works.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHawkins responded with enthusiasm:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, it works admirably! I know there\xe2\x80\x99s a hundred fortunes in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd mind, the Hawkins family get their share, Washington.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, thanks, thanks; you are just as generous as ever. Ah, it\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ngrandest invention of the age!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well; we live in wonderful times. The elements are crowded _full_\r\nof beneficent forces\xe2\x80\x94always _have_ been\xe2\x80\x94and ours is the first\r\ngeneration to turn them to account and make them work for us. Why\r\nHawkins, _everything_ is useful\xe2\x80\x94_nothing_ ought ever to be wasted. Now\r\nlook at sewer gas, for instance. Sewer gas has always been wasted,\r\nheretofore; nobody tried to save up sewer-gas\xe2\x80\x94you can\xe2\x80\x99t name me a man.\r\nAin\xe2\x80\x99t that so? _you_ know perfectly well it\xe2\x80\x99s so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes it is so\xe2\x80\x94but I never\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite see why a body\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould _want_ to save it up? Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. Do you see this\r\nlittle invention here?\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a decomposer\xe2\x80\x94I call it a decomposer. I give\r\nyou my word of honor that if you show me a house that produces a given\r\nquantity of sewer-gas in a day, I\xe2\x80\x99ll engage to set up my decomposer\r\nthere and make that house produce a hundred times that quantity of\r\nsewer-gas in less than half an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me, but why should you want to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Want_ to? Listen, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see. My boy, for illuminating purposes\r\nand economy combined, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in the world that begins with\r\nsewer-gas. And really, it don\xe2\x80\x99t cost a cent. You put in a good inferior\r\narticle of plumbing,\xe2\x80\x94such as you find everywhere\xe2\x80\x94and add my decomposer,\r\nand there you are. Just use the ordinary gas pipes\xe2\x80\x94and there your\r\nexpense ends. Think of it. Why, Major, in five years from now you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee a house lighted with anything but sewer-gas. Every physician I talk\r\nto, recommends it; and every plumber.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t it dangerous?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, yes, more or less, but everything is\xe2\x80\x94coal gas, candles, electricity\r\n\xe2\x80\x94there isn\xe2\x80\x99t anything that ain\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt lights up well, does it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, magnificently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you given it a good trial?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no, not a first rate one. Polly\xe2\x80\x99s prejudiced, and she won\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nme put it in here; but I\xe2\x80\x99m playing my cards to get it adopted in the\r\nPresident\xe2\x80\x99s house, and _then_ it\xe2\x80\x99ll go\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you doubt it. I shall not\r\nneed this one for the present, Washington; you may take it down to some\r\nboarding-house and give it a trial if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington shuddered slightly at the suggestion, then his face took on\r\na dreamy look and he dropped into a trance of thought. After a little,\r\nSellers asked him what he was grinding in his mental mill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this. Have you got some secret project in your head which\r\nrequires a Bank of England back of it to make it succeed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\np184.jpg (28K)\r\n\r\nThe Colonel showed lively astonishment, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Hawkins, are you a mind-reader?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? I never thought of such a thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then how did you happen to drop onto that idea in this curious\r\nfashion? It\xe2\x80\x99s just mind-reading, that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is, though you may not\r\nknow it. Because I _have_ got a private project that requires a Bank of\r\nEngland at its back. How could you divine that? What was the process?\r\nThis is interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any process. A thought like this happened to slip through\r\nmy head by accident: How much would make you or me comfortable? A\r\nhundred thousand. Yet you are expecting two or three of\xe2\x80\x94these\r\ninventions of yours to turn out some billions of money\xe2\x80\x94and you are\r\n_wanting_ them to do that. If you wanted ten millions, I could\r\nunderstand that\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s inside the human limits. But billions! That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclear outside the limits. There must be a definite project back of that\r\nsomewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe earl\xe2\x80\x99s interest and surprise augmented with every word, and when\r\nHawkins finished, he said with strong admiration:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s wonderfully reasoned out, Washington, it certainly is. It shows\r\nwhat I think is quite extraordinary penetration. For you\xe2\x80\x99ve hit it;\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve driven the centre, you\xe2\x80\x99ve plugged the bulls-eye of my dream. Now\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you the whole thing, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll understand it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need\r\nto ask you to keep it to yourself, because you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that the project\r\nwill prosper all the better for being kept in the background till the\r\nright time. Have you noticed how many pamphlets and books I\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nlying around relating to Russia?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think most anybody would notice that\xe2\x80\x94anybody who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been posting myself a good while. That\xe2\x80\x99s a great and,\r\nsplendid nation, and deserves to be set free.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused, then added in\r\na quite matter-of-fact way, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I get this money I\xe2\x80\x99m going to set it\r\nfree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat guns!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what makes you jump like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me, when you are going to drop a remark under a man\xe2\x80\x99s chair that\r\nis likely to blow him out through the roof, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you put some\r\nexpression, some force, some noise into it that will prepare him? You\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t flip out such a gigantic thing as this in that colorless kind\r\nof a way. You do jolt a person up, so. Go on, now, I am all right\r\nagain. Tell me all about it. I\xe2\x80\x99m all interest\xe2\x80\x94yes, and sympathy, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve looked the ground over, and concluded that the methods of\r\nthe Russian patriots, while good enough considering the way the boys\r\nare hampered, are not the best; at least not the quickest. They are\r\ntrying to revolutionize Russia from _within;_ that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty slow, you\r\nknow, and liable to interruption all the time, and is full of perils\r\nfor the workers. Do you know how Peter the Great started his army? He\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t start it on the family premises under the noses of the\r\nStrelitzes; no, he started it away off yonder, privately,\xe2\x80\x94only just one\r\nregiment, you know, and he built to _that_. The first thing the\r\nStrelitzes knew, the regiment was an _army_, their position was turned,\r\nand they had to take a walk. Just that little idea _made_ the biggest\r\nand worst of all the despotisms the world has seen. The same idea can\r\n_un_make it. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to prove it. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get out to one side\r\nand work my scheme the way Peter did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is mighty interesting, Rossmore. What is it you are going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to buy Siberia and start a republic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x94bang you go again, without giving any notice! Going to _buy_\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, as soon as I get the money. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what the price is, I\r\nshall take it. I can afford it, and I will. Now then, consider this\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve never thought of it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll warrant. Where is the place where\r\nthere is twenty-five times more manhood, pluck, true heroism,\r\nunselfishness, devotion to high and noble ideals, adoration of liberty,\r\nwide education, and _brains_, per thousand of population, than any\r\nother domain in the whole world can show?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSiberia!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true; it certainly is true, but I never thought of it before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody ever thinks of it. But it\xe2\x80\x99s so, just the same. In those mines\r\nand prisons are gathered together the very finest and noblest and\r\ncapablest multitude of human beings that God is able to create. Now if\r\nyou had that kind of a population to sell, would you offer it to a\r\ndespotism? No, the despotism has no use for it; you would lose money. A\r\ndespotism has no use for anything but human cattle. But suppose you\r\nwant to start a republic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I see. It\xe2\x80\x99s just the material for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I should say so! There\xe2\x80\x99s Siberia with just the very finest and\r\nchoicest material on the globe for a republic, and more coming\xe2\x80\x94more\r\ncoming all the time, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see! It is being daily, weekly, monthly\r\nrecruited by the most perfectly devised system that has ever been\r\ninvented, perhaps. By this system the whole of the hundred millions of\r\nRussia are being constantly and patiently sifted, sifted, sifted, by\r\nmyriads of trained experts, spies appointed by the Emperor personally;\r\nand whenever they catch a man, woman or child that has got any brains\r\nor education or character, they ship that person straight to Siberia.\r\nIt is admirable, it is wonderful. It is so searching and so effective\r\nthat it keeps the general level of Russian intellect and education down\r\nto that of the Czar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, that sounds like exaggeration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s what they say anyway. But I think, myself, it\xe2\x80\x99s a lie. And\r\nit doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem right to slander a whole nation that way, anyhow. Now,\r\nthen, you see what the material is, there in Siberia, for a republic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe paused, and his breast began to heave and his eye to burn, under the\r\nimpulse of strong emotion. Then his words began to stream forth, with\r\nconstantly increasing energy and fire, and he rose to his feet as if to\r\ngive himself larger freedom. \xe2\x80\x9cThe minute I organize that republic, the\r\nlight of liberty, intelligence, justice, humanity, bursting from it,\r\nflooding from it, flaming from it, will concentrate the gaze of the\r\nwhole astonished world as upon the miracle of a new sun; Russia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncountless multitudes of slaves will rise up and march, march!\xe2\x80\x94eastward,\r\nwith that great light transfiguring their faces as they come, and far\r\nback of them you will see-what will you see?\xe2\x80\x94a vacant throne in an\r\nempty land! It can be done, and by God I will do it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\np187.jpg (52K)\r\n\r\nHe stood a moment bereft of earthly consciousness by his exaltation;\r\nthen consciousness returned, bringing him a slight shock, and he said\r\nwith grave earnestness:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must ask you to pardon me, Major Hawkins. I have never used that\r\nexpression before, and I beg you will forgive it this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHawkins was quite willing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Washington, it is an error which I am by nature not liable\r\nto. Only excitable people, impulsive people, are exposed to it. But the\r\ncircumstances of the present case\xe2\x80\x94I being a democrat by birth and\r\npreference, and an aristocrat by inheritance and relish\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe earl stopped suddenly, his frame stiffened, and he began to stare\r\nspeechless through the curtainless window. Then he pointed, and gasped\r\nout a single rapturous word:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _is_ it, Colonel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_It!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure as you\xe2\x80\x99re born. Keep perfectly still. I\xe2\x80\x99ll apply the\r\ninfluence\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn on all my force. I\xe2\x80\x99ve brought It thus far\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfetch It right into the house. You\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was making all sorts of passes in the air with his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! Look at that. I\xe2\x80\x99ve made It smile! See?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nQuite true. Tracy, out for an afternoon stroll, had come unexpectantly\r\nupon his family arms displayed upon this shabby house-front. The\r\nhatchments made him smile; which was nothing, they had made the\r\nneighborhood cats do that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, Hawkins, look! I\xe2\x80\x99m drawing It over!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re drawing it sure, Rossmore. If I ever had any doubts about\r\nmaterialization, they\xe2\x80\x99re gone, now, and gone for good. Oh, this is a\r\njoyful day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy was sauntering over to read the door-plate. Before he was half\r\nway over he was saying to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, manifestly these are the\r\nAmerican Claimant\xe2\x80\x99s quarters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s coming\xe2\x80\x94coming right along. I\xe2\x80\x99ll slide, down and pull It in. You\r\nfollow after me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSellers, pale and a good deal agitated, opened the door and confronted\r\nTracy. The old man could not at once get his voice: then he pumped out\r\na scattering and hardly coherent salutation, and followed it with\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalk in, walk right in, Mr.\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTracy\xe2\x80\x94Howard Tracy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTracy\xe2\x80\x94thanks\xe2\x80\x94walk right in, you\xe2\x80\x99re expected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy entered, considerably puzzled, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExpected? I think there must be some mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I judge not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sellers, who\xe2\x80\x94noticing that Hawkins had arrived,\r\ngave him a sidewise glance intended to call his close attention to a\r\ndramatic effect which he was proposing to produce by his next remark.\r\nThen he said, slowly and impressively\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI am\xe2\x80\x94_You Know Who_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo the astonishment of both conspirators the remark produced no\r\ndramatic effect at all; for the new-comer responded with a quite\r\ninnocent and unembarrassed air\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, pardon me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t _know_ who you are. I only suppose\xe2\x80\x94but no doubt\r\ncorrectly\xe2\x80\x94that you are the gentleman whose title is on the doorplate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight, quite right\xe2\x80\x94sit down, pray sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d The earl was rattled,\r\nthrown off his bearings, his head was in a whirl. Then he noticed\r\nHawkins standing apart and staring idiotically at what to him was the\r\napparition of a defunct man, and a new idea was born to him. He said to\r\nTracy briskly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut a thousand pardons, dear sir, I am forgetting courtesies due to a\r\nguest and stranger. Let me introduce my friend General Hawkins\xe2\x80\x94General\r\nHawkins, our new Senator\xe2\x80\x94Senator from the latest and grandest addition\r\nto the radiant galaxy of sovereign States, Cherokee Strip\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94(to himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat name will shrivel him up!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t, in the least, and the\r\nColonel resumed the introduction piteously disheartened and\r\namazed),\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSenator Hawkins, Mr. Howard Tracy, of\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEngland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEngland!\xe2\x80\x94Why that\xe2\x80\x99s im\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEngland, yes, native of England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRecently from there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, quite recently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSaid the Colonel to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cThis phantom lies like an expert.\r\nPurifying this kind by fire don\xe2\x80\x99t work. I\xe2\x80\x99ll sound him a little\r\nfurther, give him another chance or two to work his gift.\xe2\x80\x9d Then\r\naloud\xe2\x80\x94with deep irony\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVisiting our great country for recreation and amusement, no doubt. I\r\nsuppose you find that traveling in the majestic expanses of our Far\r\nWest is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t been West, and haven\xe2\x80\x99t been devoting myself to amusement\r\nwith any sort of exclusiveness, I assure you. In fact, to merely live,\r\nan artist has got to work, not play.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArtist!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hawkins to himself, thinking of the rifled bank; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\n_is_ a name for it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre _you_ an artist?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the colonel; and added to himself, \xe2\x80\x9c_now_\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m going to catch him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a humble way, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat line?\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the sly veteran.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOils.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got him!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sellers to himself. Then aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\r\nfortunate. Could I engage you to restore some of my paintings that need\r\nthat attention?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be very glad. Pray let me see them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo shuffling, no evasion, no embarrassment, even under this crucial\r\ntest. The Colonel was nonplussed. He led Tracy to a chromo which had\r\nsuffered damage in a former owner\xe2\x80\x99s hands through being used as a lamp\r\nmat, and said, with a flourish of his hand toward the picture\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis del Sarto\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs _that_ a del Sarto?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe colonel bent a look of reproach upon Tracy, allowed it to sink\r\nhome, then resumed as if there had been no interruption\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis del Sarto is perhaps the only original of that sublime master in\r\nour country. You see, yourself, that the work is of such exceeding\r\ndelicacy that the risk\xe2\x80\x94could\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94would you mind giving me a little\r\nexample of what you can do before we\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheerfully, cheerfully. I will copy one of these marvels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWater-color materials\xe2\x80\x94relics of Miss Sally\xe2\x80\x99s college life\xe2\x80\x94were brought.\r\nTracy said he was better in oils, but would take a chance with these.\r\nSo he was left alone. He began his work, but the attractions of the\r\nplace were too strong for him, and he got up and went drifting about,\r\nfascinated; also amazed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime the earl and Hawkins were holding a troubled and anxious\r\nprivate consultation. The earl said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mystery that bothers me, is, where did It get its other arm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94it worries me, too. And another thing troubles me\xe2\x80\x94the apparition\r\nis English. How do you account for that, Colonel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonestly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Hawkins, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really know. It is very\r\nconfusing and awful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ve waked up the wrong one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wrong one? How do you account for the clothes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe clothes _are_ right, there\xe2\x80\x99s no getting around it. What are we\r\ngoing to do? We can\xe2\x80\x99t collect, as I see. The reward is for a one-armed\r\nAmerican. This is a two-armed Englishman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it may be that that is not objectionable. You see it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n_less_ than is called for, it is _more_, and so,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he saw that this argument was weak, and dropped it. The friends sat\r\nbrooding over their perplexities some time in silence. Finally the\r\nearl\xe2\x80\x99s face began to glow with an inspiration, and he said,\r\nimpressively:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHawkins, this materialization is a grander and nobler science than we\r\nhave dreamed of. We have little imagined what a solemn and stupendous\r\nthing we have done. The whole secret is perfectly clear to me, now,\r\nclear as day. _Every man is made up of heredities_, long-descended\r\natoms and particles of his ancestors. This present materialization is\r\nincomplete. We have only brought it down to perhaps the beginning of\r\nthis century.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, Colonel!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hawkins, filled with vague alarms by\r\nthe old man\xe2\x80\x99s awe-compelling words and manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis. We\xe2\x80\x99ve materialized this burglar\xe2\x80\x99s ancestor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t say that. It\xe2\x80\x99s hideous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s true, Hawkins, I _know_ it. Look at the facts. This\r\napparition is distinctly English\xe2\x80\x94note that. It uses good grammar\xe2\x80\x94note\r\nthat. It is an Artist\xe2\x80\x94note that. It has the manners and carriage of a\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x94note that. Where\xe2\x80\x99s your cow-boy? Answer me that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRossmore, this is dreadful\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s too dreadful to think of!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever resurrected a rag of that burglar but the clothes, not a\r\nsolitary rag of him but the clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cColonel, do you really mean\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Colonel brought his fist down with emphasis and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean exactly this. This materialization was immature, the burglar\r\nhas evaded us, this is nothing but a damned ancestor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose and walked the floor in great excitement.\r\n\r\nHawkins said plaintively:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a bitter disappointment\xe2\x80\x94bitter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it. I know it, Senator; I feel it as deeply as anybody could.\r\nBut we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to submit\xe2\x80\x94on moral grounds. I need money, but God knows I\r\nam not poor enough or shabby enough to be an accessory to the punishing\r\nof a man\xe2\x80\x99s ancestor for crimes committed by that ancestor\xe2\x80\x99s posterity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Colonel!\xe2\x80\x9d implored Hawkins; \xe2\x80\x9cstop and think; don\xe2\x80\x99t be rash; you\r\nknow it\xe2\x80\x99s the _only_ chance we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get the money; and besides,\r\nthe Bible itself says posterity to the fourth generation shall be\r\npunished for the sins and crimes committed by ancestors four\r\ngenerations back that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t anything to do with them; and so it\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nfair to turn the rule around and make it work both ways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Colonel was struck with the strong logic of this position. He\r\nstrode up and down, and thought it painfully over. Finally he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s reason in it; yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s reason in it. And so, although it\r\nseems a piteous thing to sweat this poor ancient devil for a burglary\r\nhe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the least hand in, still if duty commands I suppose we must\r\ngive him up to the authorities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ would,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hawkins, cheered and relieved, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d give him up if he\r\nwas a thousand ancestors compacted into one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord bless me, that\xe2\x80\x99s just what he is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sellers, with something\r\nlike a groan, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what he is; there\xe2\x80\x99s a contribution in him\r\nfrom every ancestor he ever had. In him there\xe2\x80\x99s atoms of priests,\r\nsoldiers, crusaders, poets, and sweet and gracious women\xe2\x80\x94all kinds and\r\nconditions of folk who trod this earth in old, old centuries, and\r\nvanished out of it ages ago, and now by act of ours they are summoned\r\nfrom their holy peace to answer for gutting a one-horse bank away out\r\non the borders of Cherokee Strip, and it\xe2\x80\x99s just a howling outrage!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk like that, Colonel; it takes the heart all out of me,\r\nand makes me ashamed of the part I am proposing to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA saving hope? Shout it out, I am perishing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly simple; a child would have thought of it. He is all\r\nright, not a flaw in him, as far as I have carried the work. If I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen able to bring him as far as the beginning of this century, what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nto stop me now? I\xe2\x80\x99ll go on and materialize him down to date.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLand, I never thought of that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hawkins all ablaze with joy\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the very thing. What a brain you have got! And will he\r\nshed the superfluous arm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd lose his English accent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will wholly disappear. He will speak Cherokee Strip\xe2\x80\x94and other forms\r\nof profanity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cColonel, maybe he\xe2\x80\x99ll confess!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfess? Merely that bank robbery?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMerely? Yes, but why \xe2\x80\x98merely\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Colonel said in his most impressive manner: \xe2\x80\x9cHawkins, he will be\r\nwholly under my command. I will make him confess every crime he ever\r\ncommitted. There must be a thousand. Do you get the idea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94not quite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rewards will come to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProdigious conception! I _never_ saw such a head for seeing with a\r\nlightning glance all the outlying ramifications and possibilities of a\r\ncentral idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is nothing; it comes natural to me. When his time is out in one\r\njail he goes to the next and the next, and we shall have nothing to do\r\nbut collect the rewards as he goes along. It is a perfectly steady\r\nincome as long as we live, Hawkins. And much better than other kinds of\r\ninvestments, because he is indestructible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks\xe2\x80\x94it really does look the way you say; it does indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook?\xe2\x80\x94why it _is_. It will not be denied that I have had a pretty wide\r\nand comprehensive financial experience, and I do not hesitate to say\r\nthat I consider this one of the most valuable properties I have ever\r\ncontrolled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Colonel, the wasting grind and grief of poverty! If we could\r\nrealize immediately. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean sell it all, but sell part\xe2\x80\x94enough,\r\nyou know, to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee how you tremble with excitement. That comes of lack of experience.\r\nMy boy, when you have been familiar with vast operations as long as I\r\nhave, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be different. Look at me; is my eye dilated? do you notice\r\na quiver anywhere? Feel my pulse: plunk-plunk-plunk\xe2\x80\x94same as if I were\r\nasleep. And yet, what is passing through my calm cold mind? A\r\nprocession of figures which would make a financial novice drunk just\r\nthe sight of them. Now it is by keeping cool, and looking at a thing\r\nall around, that a man sees what\xe2\x80\x99s really in it, and saves himself from\r\nthe novice\xe2\x80\x99s unfailing mistake\xe2\x80\x94the one you\xe2\x80\x99ve just suggested\xe2\x80\x94eagerness\r\nto _realize_. Listen to me. Your idea is to sell a part of him for\r\nready cash. Now mine is\xe2\x80\x94guess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t an idea. What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStock him\xe2\x80\x94of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I should never have thought of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you are not a financier. Say he has committed a thousand\r\ncrimes. Certainly that\xe2\x80\x99s a low estimate. By the look of him, even in\r\nhis unfinished condition, he has committed all of a million. But call\r\nit only a thousand to be perfectly safe; five thousand reward,\r\nmultiplied by a thousand, gives us a dead sure cash basis of\xe2\x80\x94what? Five\r\nmillion dollars!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait\xe2\x80\x94let me get my breath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the property indestructible. Perpetually fruitful\xe2\x80\x94perpetually; for\r\na property with his disposition will go on committing crimes and\r\nwinning rewards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou daze me, you make my head whirl!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it whirl, it won\xe2\x80\x99t do it any harm. Now that matter is all\r\nfixed\xe2\x80\x94leave it alone. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get up the company and issue the stock, all\r\nin good time. Just leave it in my hands. I judge you don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt my\r\nability to work it up for all it is worth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I don\xe2\x80\x99t. I can say that with truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, then. That\xe2\x80\x99s disposed of. Everything in its turn. We old\r\noperators, go by order and system\xe2\x80\x94no helter-skelter business with us.\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the next thing on the docket? The carrying on of the\r\nmaterialization\xe2\x80\x94the bringing it down to date. I will begin on that at\r\nonce. I think\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Rossmore. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t lock It in. A hundred to one it has\r\nescaped!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCalm yourself, as to that; don\xe2\x80\x99t give yourself any uneasiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it escape?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it, if it wants to. What of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, _I_ should consider it a pretty serious calamity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my dear boy, once in my power, always in my power. It may go and\r\ncome freely. I can produce it here whenever I want it, just by the\r\nexercise of my will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am truly glad to hear that, I do assure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I shall give it all the painting it wants to do, and we and the\r\nfamily will make it as comfortable and contented as we can. No occasion\r\nto restrain its movements. I hope to persuade it to remain pretty\r\nquiet, though, because a materialization which is in a state of\r\narrested development must of necessity be pretty soft and flabby and\r\nsubstanceless, and\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94by the way, I wonder where It comes from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow? What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe earl pointed significantly\xe2\x80\x94and interrogatively toward the sky.\r\nHawkins started; then settled into deep reflection; finally shook his\r\nhead sorrowfully and pointed downwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you think so, Washington?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hardly know, but really you can see, yourself, that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseem to be pining for his last place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s well thought! Soundly deduced. We\xe2\x80\x99ve done that Thing a favor. But\r\nI believe I will pump it a little, in a quiet way, and find out if we\r\nare right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long is it going to take to finish him off and fetch him down to\r\ndate, Colonel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I knew, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t. I am clear knocked out by this new\r\ndetail\xe2\x80\x94this unforeseen necessity of working a subject down gradually\r\nfrom his condition of ancestor to his ultimate result as posterity. But\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll make him hump himself, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRossmore!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear. We\xe2\x80\x99re in the laboratory. Come\xe2\x80\x94Hawkins is here. Mind, now\r\nHawkins\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s a sound, living, _human being_ to all the family\xe2\x80\x94_don\xe2\x80\x99t_\r\nforget that. Here she comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep your seats, I\xe2\x80\x99m not coming in. I just wanted to ask, who is it\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s painting down there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat? Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s a young artist; young Englishman, named Tracy; very\r\npromising\xe2\x80\x94favorite pupil of Hans Christian Andersen or one of the other\r\nold masters\xe2\x80\x94Andersen I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure it is; he\xe2\x80\x99s going to half-sole\r\nsome of our old Italian masterpieces. Been talking to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, only a word. I stumbled right in on him without expecting\r\nanybody was there. I tried to be polite to him; offered him a\r\nsnack\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94(Sellers delivered a large wink to Hawkins from behind his\r\nhand), \xe2\x80\x9cbut he declined, and said he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hungry\xe2\x80\x9d (another sarcastic\r\nwink); \xe2\x80\x9cso I brought some apples\xe2\x80\x9d (doublewink), \xe2\x80\x9cand he ate a couple\r\nof\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d and the colonel sprang some yards toward the ceiling and came\r\ndown quaking with astonishment.\r\n\r\nLady Rossmore was smitten dumb with amazement. She gazed at the\r\nsheepish relic of Cherokee Strip, then at her husband, and then at the\r\nguest again. Finally she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with you, Mulberry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not answer immediately. His back was turned; he was bending over\r\nhis chair, feeling the seat of it. But he answered next moment, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there it is; it was a tack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady contemplated him doubtfully a moment, then said, pretty\r\nsnappishly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that for a tack! Praise goodness it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a shingle nail, it\r\nwould have landed you in the Milky Way. I do hate to have my nerves\r\nshook up so.\xe2\x80\x9d And she turned on her heel and went her way.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was safely out, the Colonel said, in a suppressed voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome\xe2\x80\x94we must see for ourselves. It _must_ be a mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey hurried softly down and peeped in. Sellers whispered, in a sort of\r\ndespair\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nIt _is_ eating! What a grisly spectacle! Hawkins it\xe2\x80\x99s horrible! Take me\r\naway\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand it.\r\n\r\nThey tottered back to the laboratory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTracy made slow progress with his work, for his mind wandered a good\r\ndeal. Many things were puzzling him. Finally a light burst upon him all\r\nof a sudden\xe2\x80\x94seemed to, at any rate\xe2\x80\x94and he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nthe clew at last\xe2\x80\x94this man\xe2\x80\x99s mind is off its balance; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how\r\nmuch, but it\xe2\x80\x99s off a point or two, sure; off enough to explain this\r\nmess of perplexities, anyway. These dreadful chromos which he takes for\r\nold masters; these villainous portraits\xe2\x80\x94which to his frantic mind\r\nrepresent Rossmores; the hatchments; the pompous name of this\r\nramshackle old crib\xe2\x80\x94Rossmore Towers; and that odd assertion of his,\r\nthat I was expected. How could I be expected? that is, Lord Berkeley.\r\nHe knows by the papers that that person was burned up in the New\r\nGadsby. Why, hang it, he really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know _who_ he was expecting;\r\nfor his talk showed that he was not expecting an Englishman, or yet an\r\nartist, yet I answer his requirements notwithstanding. He seems\r\nsufficiently satisfied with me. Yes, he is a little off; in fact I am\r\nafraid he is a good deal off, poor old gentleman. But he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninteresting\xe2\x80\x94all people in about his condition are, I suppose. I hope\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll like my work; I would like to come every day and study him. And\r\nwhen I write my father\xe2\x80\x94ah, that hurts! I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t get on that subject;\r\nit isn\xe2\x80\x99t good for my spirits. Somebody coming\xe2\x80\x94I must get to work. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe old gentleman again. He looks bothered. Maybe my clothes are\r\nsuspicious; and they are\xe2\x80\x94for an artist. If my conscience would allow me\r\nto make a change, but that is out of the question. I wonder what he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmaking those passes in the air for, with his hands. I seem to be the\r\nobject of them. Can he be trying to mesmerize me? I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite like\r\nit. There\xe2\x80\x99s something uncanny about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe colonel muttered to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cIt has an effect on him, I can see it\r\nmyself. That\xe2\x80\x99s enough for one time, I reckon. He\xe2\x80\x99s not very solid, yet,\r\nI suppose, and I might disintegrate him. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just put a sly question\r\nor two at him, now, and see if I can find out what his condition is,\r\nand where he\xe2\x80\x99s from.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe approached and said affably:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let me disturb you, Mr. Tracy; I only want to take a little\r\nglimpse of your work. Ah, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s very fine indeed. You are\r\ndoing it elegantly. My daughter will be charmed with this. May I sit\r\ndown by you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do; I shall be glad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t disturb you? I mean, won\xe2\x80\x99t dissipate your inspirations?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy laughed and said they were not ethereal enough to be very easily\r\ndiscommoded.\r\n\r\nThe colonel asked a number of cautious and well-considered\r\nquestions\xe2\x80\x94questions which seemed pretty odd and flighty to Tracy\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nthe answers conveyed the information desired, apparently, for the\r\ncolonel said to himself, with mixed pride and gratification:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good job as far as I\xe2\x80\x99ve got with it. He\xe2\x80\x99s solid. Solid and\r\ngoing to last, solid as the real thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful\xe2\x80\x94wonderful. I believe I could\xe2\x80\x94petrify him.\xe2\x80\x9d After a\r\nlittle he asked, warily \xe2\x80\x9cDo you prefer being here, or\xe2\x80\x94or there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere? Where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94where you\xe2\x80\x99ve been?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy\xe2\x80\x99s thought flew to his boarding-house, and he answered with\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _here_, much!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe colonel was startled, and said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no uncertain\r\nring about that. It indicates where _he\xe2\x80\x99s_ been to, poor fellow. Well,\r\nI am satisfied, now. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I got him out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat thinking, and thinking, and watching the brush go. At length he\r\nsaid to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it certainly seems to account for the failure of\r\nmy endeavors in poor Berkeley\xe2\x80\x99s case. _He_ went in the other direction.\r\nWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. He\xe2\x80\x99s better off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSally Sellers entered from the street, now, looking her divinest, and\r\nthe artist was introduced to her. It was a violent case of mutual love\r\nat first sight, though neither party was entirely aware of the fact,\r\nperhaps. The Englishman made this irrelevant remark to himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he is not insane, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d Sally sat down, and showed an\r\ninterest in Tracy\xe2\x80\x99s work which greatly pleased him, and a benevolent\r\nforgiveness of it which convinced him that the girl\xe2\x80\x99s nature was cast\r\nin a large mould. Sellers was anxious to report his discoveries to\r\nHawkins; so he took his leave, saying that if the two \xe2\x80\x9cyoung devotees\r\nof the colored Muse\xe2\x80\x9d thought they could manage without him, he would go\r\nand look after his affairs. The artist said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI think he is\r\na little eccentric, perhaps, but that is all.\xe2\x80\x9d He reproached himself\r\nfor having injuriously judged a man without giving him any fair chance\r\nto show what he really was.\r\n\r\n\r\np204.jpg (29K)\r\n\r\nOf course the stranger was very soon at his ease and chatting along\r\ncomfortably. The average American girl possesses the valuable qualities\r\nof naturalness, honesty, and inoffensive straightforwardness; she is\r\nnearly barren of troublesome conventions and artificialities,\r\nconsequently her presence and her ways are unembarrassing, and one is\r\nacquainted with her and on the pleasantest terms with her before he\r\nknows how it came about. This new acquaintanceship\xe2\x80\x94friendship,\r\nindeed\xe2\x80\x94progressed swiftly; and the unusual swiftness of it, and the\r\nthoroughness of it are sufficiently evidenced and established by one\r\nnoteworthy fact\xe2\x80\x94that within the first half hour both parties had ceased\r\nto be conscious of Tracy\xe2\x80\x99s clothes. Later this consciousness was\r\nre-awakened; it was then apparent to Gwendolen that she was almost\r\nreconciled to them, and it was apparent to Tracy that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. The\r\nre-awakening was brought about by Gwendolen\xe2\x80\x99s inviting the artist to\r\nstay to dinner. He had to decline, because he wanted to live, now\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nis, now that there was something to live for\xe2\x80\x94and he could not survive\r\nin those clothes at a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s table. He thought he knew that. But\r\nhe went away happy, for he saw that Gwendolen was disappointed.\r\n\r\nAnd whither did he go? He went straight to a slopshop and bought as\r\nneat and reasonably well-fitting a suit of clothes as an Englishman\r\ncould be persuaded to wear. He said\xe2\x80\x94_to_ himself, but _at_ his\r\nconscience\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI know it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong; but it would be wrong _not_ to do it;\r\nand two wrongs do not make a right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis satisfied him, and made his heart light. Perhaps it will also\r\nsatisfy the reader\xe2\x80\x94if he can make out what it means.\r\n\r\nThe old people were troubled about Gwendolen at dinner, because she was\r\nso distraught and silent. If they had noticed, they would have found\r\nthat she was sufficiently alert and interested whenever the talk\r\nstumbled upon the artist and his work; but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice, and so\r\nthe chat would swap around to some other subject, and then somebody\r\nwould presently be privately worrying about Gwendolen again, and\r\nwondering if she were not well, or if something had gone wrong in the\r\nmillinery line. Her mother offered her various reputable patent\r\nmedicines, and tonics with iron and other hardware in them, and her\r\nfather even proposed to send out for wine, relentless prohibitionist\r\nand head of the order in the District of Columbia as he was, but these\r\nkindnesses were all declined\xe2\x80\x94thankfully, but with decision. At bedtime,\r\nwhen the family were breaking up for the night, she privately looted\r\none of the brushes, saying to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the one he has used, the\r\nmost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next morning Tracy went forth wearing his new suit, and equipped\r\nwith a pink in his button-hole\xe2\x80\x94a daily attention from Puss. His whole\r\nsoul was full of Gwendolen Sellers, and this condition was an\r\ninspiration, art-wise. All the morning his brush pawed nimbly away at\r\nthe canvases, almost without his awarity\xe2\x80\x94awarity, in this sense being\r\nthe sense of being aware, though disputed by some authorities\xe2\x80\x94turning\r\nout marvel upon marvel, in the way of decorative accessories to the\r\nportraits, with a felicity and celerity which amazed the veterans of\r\nthe firm and fetched out of them continuous explosions of applause.\r\n\r\nMeantime Gwendolen was losing her morning, and many dollars. She\r\nsupposed Tracy was coming in the forenoon\xe2\x80\x94a conclusion which she had\r\njumped to without outside help. So she tripped down stairs every little\r\nwhile from her work-parlor to arrange the brushes and things over\r\nagain, and see if he had arrived. And when she was in her work-parlor\r\nit was not profitable, but just the other way\xe2\x80\x94as she found out to her\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\nShe had put in her idle moments during the last little while back, in\r\ndesigning a particularly rare and capable gown for herself, and this\r\nmorning she set about making it up; but she was absent minded, and made\r\nan irremediable botch of it. When she saw what she had done, she knew\r\nthe reason of it and the meaning of it; and she put her work away from\r\nher and said she would accept the sign. And from that time forth she\r\ncame no more away from the Audience Chamber, but remained there and\r\nwaited. After luncheon she waited again. A whole hour. Then a great joy\r\nwelled up in her heart, for she saw him coming. So she flew back up\r\nstairs thankful, and could hardly wait for him to miss the principal\r\nbrush, which she had mislaid down there, but knew where she had mislaid\r\nit. However, all in good time the others were called in and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfind the brush, and then she was sent for, and she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find it\r\nherself for some little time; but then she found it when the others had\r\ngone away to hunt in the kitchen and down cellar and in the woodshed,\r\nand all those other places where people look for things whose ways they\r\nare not familiar with. So she gave him the brush, and remarked that she\r\nought to have seen that everything was ready for him, but it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseemed necessary, because it was so early that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t expecting\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nshe stopped there, surprised at herself for what she was saying; and he\r\nfelt caught and ashamed, and said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew my impatience\r\nwould drag me here before I was expected, and betray me, and that is\r\njust what it has done; she sees straight through me\xe2\x80\x94and is laughing at\r\nme, inside, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGwendolen was very much pleased, on one account, and a little the other\r\nway in another; pleased with the new clothes and the improvement which\r\nthey had achieved; less pleased by the pink in the buttonhole.\r\nYesterday\xe2\x80\x99s pink had hardly interested her; this one was just like it,\r\nbut somehow it had got her immediate attention, and kept it. She wished\r\nshe could think of some way of getting at its history in a properly\r\ncolorless and indifferent way. Presently she made a venture. She said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever a man\xe2\x80\x99s age may be, he can reduce it several years by putting\r\na bright-colored flower in his button-hole. I have often noticed that.\r\nIs that your sex\xe2\x80\x99s reason for wearing a boutonniere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancy not, but certainly that reason would be a sufficient one. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnever heard of the idea before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to prefer pinks. Is it on account of the color, or the form?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, simply, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are given to me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I have\r\nany preference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are given to him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, and she felt a coldness\r\ntoward that pink. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder who it is, and what she is like.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nflower began to take up a good deal of room; it obtruded itself\r\neverywhere, it intercepted all views, and marred them; it was becoming\r\nexceedingly annoying and conspicuous for a little thing. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if\r\nhe cares for her.\xe2\x80\x9d That thought gave her a quite definite pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe had made everything comfortable for the artist; there was no\r\nfurther pretext for staying. So she said she would go, now, and asked\r\nhim to summon the servants in case he should need anything. She went\r\naway unhappy; and she left unhappiness behind her; for she carried away\r\nall the sunshine. The time dragged heavily for both, now. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npaint for thinking of her; she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t design or millinerize with any\r\nheart, for thinking of him. Never before had painting seemed so empty\r\nto him, never before had millinerizing seemed so void of interest to\r\nher. She had gone without repeating that dinner-invitation\xe2\x80\x94an almost\r\nunendurable disappointment to him. On her part-well, she was suffering,\r\ntoo; for she had found she _couldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ invite him. It was not hard\r\nyesterday, but it was impossible to-day. A thousand innocent privileges\r\nseemed to have been filched from her unawares in the past twenty-four\r\nhours. To-day she felt strangely hampered, restrained of her liberty.\r\nTo-day she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t propose to herself to do anything or say anything\r\nconcerning this young man without being instantly paralyzed into\r\nnon-action by the fear that he might \xe2\x80\x9csuspect.\xe2\x80\x9d Invite him to dinner\r\n_to-day?_ It made her shiver to think of it.\r\n\r\nAnd so her afternoon was one long fret. Broken at intervals. Three\r\ntimes she had to go down stairs on errands\xe2\x80\x94that is, she thought she had\r\nto go down stairs on errands. Thus, going and coming, she had six\r\nglimpses of him, in the aggregate, without seeming to look in his\r\ndirection; and she tried to endure these electric ecstasies without\r\nshowing any sign, but they fluttered her up a good deal, and she felt\r\nthat the naturalness she was putting on was overdone and quite too\r\nfrantically sober and hysterically calm to deceive.\r\n\r\nThe painter had his share of the rapture; he had his six glimpses, and\r\nthey smote him with waves of pleasure that assaulted him, beat upon\r\nhim, washed over him deliciously, and drowned out all consciousness of\r\nwhat he was doing with his brush. So there were six places in his\r\ncanvas which had to be done over again.\r\n\r\n\r\np210.jpg (23K)\r\n\r\nAt last Gwendolen got some peace of mind by sending word to the\r\nThompsons, in the neighborhood, that she was coming there to dinner.\r\nShe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be reminded, at _that_ table, that there was an absentee\r\nwho ought to be a presentee\xe2\x80\x94a word which she meant to look out in the\r\ndictionary at a calmer time.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the old earl dropped in for a chat with the artist, and\r\ninvited him to stay to dinner. Tracy cramped down his joy and gratitude\r\nby a sudden and powerful exercise of all his forces; and he felt that\r\nnow that he was going to be close to Gwendolen, and hear her voice and\r\nwatch her face during several precious hours, earth had nothing\r\nvaluable to add to his life for the present.\r\n\r\nThe earl said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cThis spectre can eat apples, apparently. We\r\nshall find out, now, if that is a specialty. I think, myself, it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nspecialty. Apples, without doubt, constitute the spectral limit. It was\r\nthe case with our first parents. No, I am wrong\xe2\x80\x94at least only partly\r\nright. The line _was_ drawn at apples, just as in the present case, but\r\nit was from the other direction.\xe2\x80\x9d The new clothes gave him a thrill of\r\npleasure and pride. He said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got part of him down to\r\ndate, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSellers said he was pleased with Tracy\xe2\x80\x99s work; and he went on and\r\nengaged him to restore his old masters, and said he should also want\r\nhim to paint his portrait and his wife\xe2\x80\x99s and possibly his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nThe tide of the artist\xe2\x80\x99s happiness was at flood, now. The chat flowed\r\npleasantly along while Tracy painted and Sellers carefully unpacked a\r\npicture which he had brought with him. It was a chromo; a new one, just\r\nout. It was the smirking, self-satisfied portrait of a man who was\r\ninundating the Union with advertisements inviting everybody to buy his\r\nspecialty, which was a three-dollar shoe or a dress-suit or something\r\nof that kind. The old gentleman rested the chromo flat upon his lap and\r\ngazed down tenderly upon it, and became silent and meditative.\r\nPresently Tracy noticed that he was dripping tears on it. This touched\r\nthe young fellow\xe2\x80\x99s sympathetic nature, and at the same time gave him\r\nthe painful sense of being an intruder upon a sacred privacy, an\r\nobserver of emotions which a stranger ought not to witness. But his\r\npity rose superior to other considerations, and compelled him to try to\r\ncomfort the old mourner with kindly words and a show of friendly\r\ninterest. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry\xe2\x80\x94is it a friend whom\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, more than that, far more than that\xe2\x80\x94a relative, the dearest I had\r\non earth, although I was never permitted to see him. Yes, it is young\r\nLord Berkeley, who perished so heroically in the awful conflagration.\r\nWhy what is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing, nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a little startling to be so suddenly brought face to face, so\r\nto speak, with a person one has heard so much talk about. Is it a good\r\nlikeness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout doubt, yes. I never saw him, but you can easily see the\r\nresemblance to his father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sellers, holding up the chromo and\r\nglancing from it to the chromo misrepresenting the Usurping Earl and\r\nback again with an approving eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no\xe2\x80\x94I am not sure that I make out the likeness. It is plain that\r\nthe Usurping Earl there has a great deal of character and a long face\r\nlike a horse\xe2\x80\x99s, whereas his heir here is smirky, moon-faced and\r\ncharacterless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are all that way in the beginning\xe2\x80\x94all the line,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sellers,\r\nundisturbed. \xe2\x80\x9cWe all start as moonfaced fools, then later we tadpole\r\nalong into horse-faced marvels of intellect and character. It is by\r\nthat sign and by that fact that I detect the resemblance here and know\r\nthis portrait to be genuine and perfect. Yes, all our family are fools\r\nat first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis young man seems to meet the hereditary requirement, certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, he was a fool, without any doubt. Examine the face, the\r\nshape of the head, the expression. It\xe2\x80\x99s all fool, fool, fool, straight\r\nthrough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said Tracy, involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean for explaining it to me. Go on, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I was saying, fool is printed all over the face. A body can even\r\nread the _de_tails.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do they say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, added up, he is a wobbler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA which?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWobbler. A person that\xe2\x80\x99s always taking a firm stand about something or\r\nother\xe2\x80\x94kind of a Gibraltar stand, _he_ thinks, for unshakable fidelity\r\nand everlastingness\xe2\x80\x94and then, inside of a little while, he begins to\r\nwobble; no more Gibraltar there; no, sir, a mighty ordinary commonplace\r\nweakling wobbling around on stilts. That\xe2\x80\x99s Lord Berkeley to a dot, you\r\ncan _see_ it\xe2\x80\x94_look_ at that sheep! But,\xe2\x80\x94why are you blushing like\r\nsunset! Dear sir, have I unwittingly offended in some way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no indeed, no indeed. Far from it. But it always makes me blush to\r\nhear a man revile his own blood.\xe2\x80\x9d He said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cHow strangely\r\nhis vagrant and unguided fancies have hit upon the truth. By accident,\r\nhe has described me. I am that contemptible thing. When I left England\r\nI thought I knew myself; I thought I was a very Frederick the Great for\r\nresolution and staying capacity; whereas in truth I am just a Wobbler,\r\nsimply a Wobbler. Well\xe2\x80\x94after all, it is at least creditable to _have_\r\nhigh ideals and give birth to lofty resolutions; I will allow myself\r\nthat comfort.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he said, aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cCould this sheep, as you call him,\r\nbreed a great and self-sacrificing idea in his head, do you think?\r\nCould he meditate such a thing, for instance, as the renunciation of\r\nthe earldom and its wealth and its glories, and voluntary retirement to\r\nthe ranks of the commonalty, there to rise by his own merit or remain\r\nforever poor and obscure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Could_ he? Why, look at him\xe2\x80\x94look at this simpering self-righteous\r\nmug! There is your answer. It\xe2\x80\x99s the very thing he would think of. And\r\nhe would start in to do it, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d wobble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd back down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that to happen with _all_ my\xe2\x80\x94I mean would that happen to _all_ his\r\nhigh resolutions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh certainly\xe2\x80\x94certainly. It\xe2\x80\x99s the Rossmore of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen this creature was fortunate to die! Suppose, for argument\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\r\nthat I was a Rossmore, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it\xe2\x80\x99s not a supposable case. To be a Rossmore at your age,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d have to be a fool, and you\xe2\x80\x99re not a fool. And you\xe2\x80\x99d have to be a\r\nWobbler, whereas anybody that is an expert in reading character can see\r\nat a glance that when you set your foot down once, it\xe2\x80\x99s there to stay;\r\nand earthquake can\xe2\x80\x99t wobble it.\xe2\x80\x9d He added to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s enough to\r\nsay to him, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t half strong enough for the facts. The more I\r\nobserve him, now, the more remarkable I find him. It is the strongest\r\nface I have ever examined. There is almost superhuman firmness here,\r\nimmovable purpose, iron steadfastness of will. A most extraordinary\r\nyoung man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe presently said, aloud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome time I want to ask your advice about a little matter, Mr. Tracy.\r\nYou see, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got that young lord\xe2\x80\x99s remains\xe2\x80\x94my goodness, how you jump!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing, pray go on. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got his remains?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure they are his, and not somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, perfectly sure. Samples, I mean. Not all of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSamples?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94in baskets. Some time you will be going home; and if you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind taking them along\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho? I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94certainly. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean _now;_ but after a while; after\xe2\x80\x94but look\r\nhere, would you like to see them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! Most certainly not. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, very well. I only thought\xe2\x80\x94hey, where are you going, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut to dinner, papa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy was aghast. The colonel said, in a disappointed voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Sho, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know she was going out, Mr. Tracy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nGwendolen\xe2\x80\x99s face began to take on a sort of apprehensive\r\nWhat-have-I-done expression. \xe2\x80\x9cThree old people to one young one\xe2\x80\x94well,\r\nit _isn\xe2\x80\x99t_ a good team, that\xe2\x80\x99s a fact.\xe2\x80\x9d Gwendolen\xe2\x80\x99s face betrayed a\r\ndawning hopefulness and she said\xe2\x80\x94with a tone of reluctance which hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthe hall-mark on it\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you prefer, I will send word to the Thompsons that I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, is it the Thompsons? That simplifies it\xe2\x80\x94sets everything right. We\r\ncan fix it without spoiling your arrangements, my child. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nyour heart set on\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut papa, I\xe2\x80\x99d _just_ as soon go there some other\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t have it. You are a good hard-working darling child, and\r\nyour father is not the man to disappoint you when you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut papa, I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo along, I won\xe2\x80\x99t hear a word. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get along, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGwendolen was ready to cry with vexation. But there was nothing to do\r\nbut start; which she was about to do when her father hit upon an idea\r\nwhich filled him with delight because it so deftly covered all the\r\ndifficulties of the situation and made things smooth and satisfactory:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got it, my love, so that you won\xe2\x80\x99t be robbed of your holiday and\r\nat the same time we\xe2\x80\x99ll be pretty satisfactorily fixed for a good time\r\nhere. You send Belle Thompson here\xe2\x80\x94perfectly beautiful creature, Tracy,\r\nperfectly beautiful; I want you to see that girl; why, you\xe2\x80\x99ll just go\r\nmad; you\xe2\x80\x99ll go mad inside of a minute; yes, you send her right along,\r\nGwendolen, and tell her\xe2\x80\x94why, she\xe2\x80\x99s gone!\xe2\x80\x9d He turned\xe2\x80\x94she was already\r\npassing out at the gate. He muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter; I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what her mouth\xe2\x80\x99s doing, but I think her shoulders are\r\nswearing. Well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sellers blithely to Tracy, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall miss\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94parents always miss the children as soon as they\xe2\x80\x99re out of sight,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s only a natural and wisely ordained partiality\xe2\x80\x94but you\xe2\x80\x99ll be all\r\nright, because Miss Belle will supply the youthful element for you and\r\nto your entire content; and we old people will do our best, too. We\r\nshall have a good enough time. And you\xe2\x80\x99ll have a chance to get better\r\nacquainted with Admiral Hawkins. That\xe2\x80\x99s a rare character, Mr. Tracy\xe2\x80\x94one\r\nof the rarest and most engaging characters the world has produced.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find him worth studying. I\xe2\x80\x99ve studied him ever since he was a\r\nchild and have always found him developing. I really consider that one\r\nof the main things that have enabled me to master the difficult science\r\nof character-reading was the vivid interest I always felt in that boy\r\nand the baffling inscrutabilities of his ways and inspirations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy was not hearing a word. His spirits were gone, he was desolate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a most wonderful character. Concealment\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the basis of it.\r\nAlways the first thing you want to do is to find the keystone a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharacter is built on\xe2\x80\x94then you\xe2\x80\x99ve got it. No misleading and apparently\r\ninconsistent peculiarities can fool you then. What do you read on the\r\nSenator\xe2\x80\x99s surface? Simplicity; a kind of rank and protuberant\r\nsimplicity; whereas, in fact, that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the deepest minds in the\r\nworld. A perfectly honest man\xe2\x80\x94an absolutely honest and honorable\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94and yet without doubt the profoundest master of dissimulation the\r\nworld has ever seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, it\xe2\x80\x99s devilish!\xe2\x80\x9d This was wrung from the unlistening Tracy by the\r\nanguished thought of what might have been if only the dinner\r\narrangements hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got mixed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call it that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sellers, who was now placidly\r\nwalking up and down the room with his hands under his coat-tails and\r\nlistening to himself talk. \xe2\x80\x9cOne could quite properly call it devilish\r\nin another man, but not in the Senator. Your _term_ is right\xe2\x80\x94perfectly\r\nright\xe2\x80\x94I grant that\xe2\x80\x94but the application is wrong. It makes a great\r\ndifference. Yes, he is a marvelous character. I do not suppose that any\r\nother statesman ever had such a colossal sense of humor, combined with\r\nthe ability to totally conceal it. I may except George Washington and\r\nCromwell, and perhaps Robespierre, but I draw the line there. A person\r\nnot an expert might be in Judge Hawkins\xe2\x80\x99s company a lifetime and never\r\nfind out he had any more sense of humor than a cemetery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA deep-drawn yard-long sigh from the distraught and dreaming artist,\r\nfollowed by a murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cMiserable, oh, miserable!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say _that_ about it, quite. On the contrary, I\r\nadmire his ability to conceal his humor even more if possible than I\r\nadmire the gift itself, stupendous as it is. Another thing\xe2\x80\x94General\r\nHawkins is a thinker; a keen, logical, exhaustive, analytical\r\nthinker\xe2\x80\x94perhaps the ablest of modern times. That is, of course, upon\r\nthemes suited to his size, like the glacial period, and the correlation\r\nof forces, and the evolution of the Christian from the caterpillar\xe2\x80\x94any\r\nof those things; give him a subject according to his size, and just\r\nstand back and watch him think! Why you can see the place rock! Ah,\r\nyes, you must know him; you must get on the inside of him. Perhaps the\r\nmost extraordinary mind since Aristotle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinner was kept waiting for a while for Miss Thompson, but as Gwendolen\r\nhad not delivered the invitation to her the waiting did no good, and\r\nthe household presently went to the meal without her. Poor old Sellers\r\ntried everything his hospitable soul could devise to make the occasion\r\nan enjoyable one for the guest, and the guest tried his honest best to\r\nbe cheery and chatty and happy for the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s sake; in fact\r\nall hands worked hard in the interest of a mutual good time, but the\r\nthing was a failure from the start; Tracy\xe2\x80\x99s heart was lead in his\r\nbosom, there seemed to be only one prominent feature in the landscape\r\nand that was a vacant chair, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t drag his mind away from\r\nGwendolen and his hard luck; consequently his distractions allowed\r\ndeadly pauses to slip in every now and then when it was his turn to say\r\nsomething, and of course this disease spread to the rest of the\r\nconversation\xe2\x80\x94wherefore, instead of having a breezy sail in sunny\r\nwaters, as anticipated, everybody was bailing out and praying for land.\r\nWhat _could_ the matter be? Tracy alone could have told, the others\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even invent a theory.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile they were having a similarly dismal time at the Thompson\r\nhouse; in fact a twin experience. Gwendolen was ashamed of herself for\r\nallowing her disappointment to so depress her spirits and make her so\r\nstrangely and profoundly miserable; but feeling ashamed of herself\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t improve the matter any; it only seemed to aggravate the\r\nsuffering. She explained that she was not feeling very well, and\r\neverybody could see that this was true; so she got sincere sympathy and\r\ncommiseration; but that didn\xe2\x80\x99t help the case. Nothing helps that kind\r\nof a case. It is best to just stand off and let it fester. The moment\r\nthe dinner was over the girl excused herself, and she hurried home\r\nfeeling unspeakably grateful to get away from that house and that\r\nintolerable captivity and suffering.\r\n\r\nWill he be gone? The thought arose in her brain, but took effect in her\r\nheels. She slipped into the house, threw off her things and made\r\nstraight for the dining room. She stopped and listened. Her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice\xe2\x80\x94with no life in it; presently her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94no life in that; a\r\nconsiderable vacancy, then a sterile remark from Washington Hawkins.\r\nAnother silence; then, not Tracy\xe2\x80\x99s but her father\xe2\x80\x99s voice again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s gone,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself despairingly, and listlessly opened\r\nthe door and stepped within.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my child,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the mother, \xe2\x80\x9chow white you are! Are you\xe2\x80\x94has\r\nanything\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhite?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sellers. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s gone like a flash; \xe2\x80\x99twasn\xe2\x80\x99t serious.\r\nAlready she\xe2\x80\x99s as red as the soul of a watermelon! Sit down, dear, sit\r\ndown\xe2\x80\x94goodness knows you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome. Did you have a good time? We\xe2\x80\x99ve had\r\ngreat times here\xe2\x80\x94immense. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t Miss Belle come? Mr. Tracy is not\r\nfeeling well, and she\xe2\x80\x99d have made him forget it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was content now; and out from her happy eyes there went a light\r\nthat told a secret to another pair of eyes there and got a secret in\r\nreturn. In just that infinitely small fraction of a second those two\r\ngreat confessions were made, received, and perfectly understood. All\r\nanxiety, apprehension, uncertainty, vanished out of these young\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s hearts and left them filled with a great peace.\r\n\r\nSellers had had the most confident faith that with the new\r\nreinforcement victory would be at this last moment snatched from the\r\njaws of defeat, but it was an error. The talk was as stubbornly\r\ndisjointed as ever. He was proud of Gwendolen, and liked to show her\r\noff, even against Miss Belle Thompson, and here had been a great\r\nopportunity, and what had she made of it? He felt a good deal put out.\r\nIt vexed him to think that this Englishman, with the traveling Briton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neverlasting disposition to generalize whole mountain ranges from single\r\nsample-grains of sand, would jump to the conclusion that American girls\r\nwere as dumb as himself\xe2\x80\x94generalizing the whole tribe from this single\r\nsample and she at her poorest, there being nothing at that table to\r\ninspire her, give her a start, keep her from going to sleep. He made up\r\nhis mind that for the honor of the country he would bring these two\r\ntogether again over the social board before long. There would be a\r\ndifferent result another time, he judged. He said to himself, with a\r\ndeep sense of injury, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll put in his diary\xe2\x80\x94they all keep\r\ndiaries\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99ll put in his diary that she was miraculously\r\nuninteresting\xe2\x80\x94dear, dear, but _wasn\xe2\x80\x99t_ she!\xe2\x80\x94I never saw the like\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nyet looking as beautiful as Satan, too\xe2\x80\x94and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to do anything\r\nbut paw bread crumbs, and pick flowers to pieces, and look fidgety. And\r\nit isn\xe2\x80\x99t any better here in the Hall of Audience. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough; I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhaul down my flag\xe2\x80\x94the others may fight it out if they want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook hands all around and went off to do some work which he said\r\nwas pressing. The idolaters were the width of the room apart; and\r\napparently unconscious of each other\xe2\x80\x99s presence. The distance got\r\nshortened a little, now. Very soon the mother withdrew. The distance\r\nnarrowed again. Tracy stood before a chromo of some Ohio politician\r\nwhich had been retouched and chain-mailed for a crusading Rossmore, and\r\nGwendolen was sitting on the sofa not far from his elbow artificially\r\nabsorbed in examining a photograph album that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t any photographs in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cSenator\xe2\x80\x9d still lingered. He was sorry for the young people; it had\r\nbeen a dull evening for them. In the goodness of his heart he tried to\r\nmake it pleasant for them now; tried to remove the ill impression\r\nnecessarily left by the general defeat; tried to be chatty, even tried\r\nto be gay. But the responses were sickly, there was no starting any\r\nenthusiasm; he would give it up and quit\xe2\x80\x94it was a day specially picked\r\nout and consecrated to failures.\r\n\r\nBut when Gwendolen rose up promptly and smiled a glad smile and said\r\nwith thankfulness and blessing,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_Must_ you go?\xe2\x80\x9d it seemed cruel to\r\ndesert, and he sat down again.\r\n\r\nHe was about to begin a remark when\xe2\x80\x94when he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. We have all been\r\nthere. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how he knew his concluding to stay longer had\r\nbeen a mistake, he merely knew it; and knew it for dead certain, too.\r\nAnd so he bade goodnight, and went mooning out, wondering what he could\r\nhave done that changed the atmosphere that way. As the door closed\r\nbehind him those two were standing side by side, looking at that\r\ndoor\xe2\x80\x94looking at it in a waiting, second-counting, but deeply grateful\r\nkind of way. And the instant it closed they flung their arms about each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s necks, and there, heart to heart and lip to lip\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God, she\xe2\x80\x99s kissing it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNobody heard this remark, because Hawkins, who bred it, only thought\r\nit, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t utter it. He had turned, the moment he had closed the\r\ndoor, and had pushed it open a little, intending to re-enter and ask\r\nwhat ill-advised thing he had done or said, and apologize for it. But\r\nhe didn\xe2\x80\x99t re-enter; he staggered off stunned, terrified, distressed.\r\n\r\n\r\np222.jpg (33K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive minutes later he was sitting in his room, with his head bowed\r\nwithin the circle of his arms, on the table\xe2\x80\x94final attitude of grief and\r\ndespair. His tears were flowing fast, and now and then a sob broke upon\r\nthe stillness. Presently he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew her when she was a little child and used to climb about my\r\nknees; I love her as I love my own, and now\xe2\x80\x94oh, poor thing, poor thing,\r\nI cannot bear it!\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s gone and lost her heart to this mangy\r\nmaterializee! Why _didn\xe2\x80\x99t_ we see that that might happen? But how could\r\nwe? Nobody could; nobody could ever have dreamed of such a thing. You\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect a person would fall in love with a wax-work. And this\r\none doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even amount to that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went on grieving to himself, and now and then giving voice to his\r\nlamentations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s done, oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s done, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no help for it, no undoing the\r\nmiserable business. If I had the nerve, I would kill it. But that\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do any good. _She_ loves it; she thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s genuine and\r\nauthentic. If she lost it she would grieve for it just as she would for\r\na real person. And who\xe2\x80\x99s to break it to the family! Not I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll die\r\nfirst. Sellers is the best human being I ever knew and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t any\r\nmore think of\xe2\x80\x94oh, dear, why it\xe2\x80\x99ll break his heart when he finds it out.\r\nAnd Polly\xe2\x80\x99s too. _This_ comes of meddling with such infernal matters!\r\nBut for this, the creature would still be roasting in Sheol where it\r\nbelongs. How is it that these people don\xe2\x80\x99t smell the brimstone?\r\nSometimes I can\xe2\x80\x99t come into the same room with him without nearly\r\nsuffocating.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a while he broke out again:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there\xe2\x80\x99s _one_ thing, sure. The materializing has got to stop\r\nright where it is. If she\xe2\x80\x99s got to marry a spectre, let her marry a\r\ndecent one out of the Middle Ages, like this one\xe2\x80\x94not a cowboy and a\r\nthief such as this protoplasmic tadpole\xe2\x80\x99s going to turn into if Sellers\r\nkeeps on fussing at it. It costs five thousand dollars cash and shuts\r\ndown on the incorporated company to stop the works at this point, but\r\nSally Sellers\xe2\x80\x99s happiness is worth more than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe heard Sellers coming, and got himself to rights. Sellers took a\r\nseat, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to confess I\xe2\x80\x99m a good deal puzzled. It did certainly\r\neat, there\xe2\x80\x99s no getting around it. Not eat, exactly, either, but it\r\nnibbled; nibbled in an appetiteless way, but still it nibbled; and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s just a marvel. Now the question is, what does it do with those\r\nnibblings? That\xe2\x80\x99s it\xe2\x80\x94what does it do with them? My idea is that we\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t begin to know all there is to this stupendous discovery yet. But\r\ntime will show\xe2\x80\x94time and science\xe2\x80\x94give us a chance, and don\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nimpatient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get Hawkins interested; couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make him talk to\r\namount to anything; couldn\xe2\x80\x99t drag him out of his depression. But at\r\nlast he took a turn that arrested Hawkins\xe2\x80\x99s attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m coming to like him, Hawkins. He is a person of stupendous\r\ncharacter\xe2\x80\x94absolutely gigantic. Under that placid exterior is concealed\r\nthe most dare-devil spirit that was ever put into a man\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s just a\r\nClive over again. Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m all admiration for him, on account of his\r\ncharacter, and liking naturally follows admiration, you know. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ncoming to like him immensely. Do you know, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the heart to\r\ndegrade such a character as that down to the burglar estate for money\r\nor for anything else; and I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to ask if you are willing to let\r\nthe reward go, and leave this poor fellow\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere he is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94not bring him down to date.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there\xe2\x80\x99s my hand; and my heart\xe2\x80\x99s in it, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll never forget you for this, Hawkins,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman in a\r\nvoice which he found it hard to control. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are making a great\r\nsacrifice for me, and one which you can ill afford, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll never\r\nforget your generosity, and if I live you shall not suffer for it, be\r\nsure of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSally Sellers immediately and vividly realized that she was become a\r\nnew being; a being of a far higher and worthier sort than she had been\r\nsuch a little while before; an earnest being, in place of a dreamer;\r\nand supplied with a reason for her presence in the world, where merely\r\na wistful and troubled curiosity about it had existed before. So great\r\nand so comprehensive was the change which had been wrought, that she\r\nseemed to herself to be a real person who had lately been a shadow; a\r\nsomething which had lately been a nothing; a purpose, which had lately\r\nbeen a fancy; a finished temple, with the altar-fires lit and the voice\r\nof worship ascending, where before had been but an architect\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconfusion of arid working plans, unintelligible to the passing eye and\r\nprophesying nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady\xe2\x80\x9d Gwendolen! The pleasantness of that sound was all gone; it was\r\nan offense to her ear now. She said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x94that sham belongs to the past; I will not be called by it any\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may call you simply Gwendolen? You will allow me to drop the\r\nformalities straightway and name you by your dear first name without\r\nadditions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was dethroning the pink and replacing it with a rosebud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x94that is better. I hate pinks\xe2\x80\x94some pinks. Indeed yes, you are to\r\ncall me by my first name without additions\xe2\x80\x94that is,\xe2\x80\x94well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean\r\nwithout additions _entirely_, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as far as she could get. There was a pause; his intellect was\r\nstruggling to comprehend; presently it did manage to catch the idea in\r\ntime to save embarrassment all around, and he said gratefully\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Dear_ Gwendolen! I may say that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94part of it. But\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t kiss me when I am talking, it makes me\r\nforget what I was going to say. You can call me by part of that form,\r\nbut not the last part. Gwendolen is not my name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot your name?\xe2\x80\x9d This in a tone of wonder and surprise.\r\n\r\nThe girl\xe2\x80\x99s soul was suddenly invaded by a creepy apprehension, a quite\r\ndefinite sense of suspicion and alarm. She put his arms away from her,\r\nlooked him searchingly in the eye, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnswer me truly, on your honor. You are not seeking to marry me on\r\naccount of my _rank?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shot almost knocked him through the wall, he was so little prepared\r\nfor it. There was something so finely grotesque about the question and\r\nits parent suspicion, that he stopped to wonder and admire, and thus\r\nwas he saved from laughing. Then, without wasting precious time, he set\r\nabout the task of convincing her that he had been lured by herself\r\nalone, and had fallen in love with her only, not her title and\r\nposition; that he loved her with all his heart, and could not love her\r\nmore if she were a duchess, or less if she were without home, name or\r\nfamily. She watched his face wistfully, eagerly, hopefully, translating\r\nhis words by its expression; and when he had finished there was\r\ngladness in her heart\xe2\x80\x94a tumultuous gladness, indeed, though outwardly\r\nshe was calm, tranquil, even judicially austere. She prepared a\r\nsurprise for him, now, calculated to put a heavy strain upon those\r\ndisinterested protestations of his; and thus she delivered it, burning\r\nit away word by word as the fuse burns down to a bombshell, and\r\nwatching to see how far the explosion would lift him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen\xe2\x80\x94and do not doubt me, for I shall speak the exact truth. Howard\r\nTracy, I am no more an earl\xe2\x80\x99s child than you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo her joy\xe2\x80\x94and secret surprise, also\xe2\x80\x94it never phased him. He was ready,\r\nthis time, and saw his chance. He cried out with enthusiasm, \xe2\x80\x9cThank\r\nheaven for that!\xe2\x80\x9d and gathered her to his arms.\r\n\r\nTo express her happiness was almost beyond her gift of speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou make me the proudest girl in all the earth,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with her\r\nhead pillowed on his shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it only natural that you\r\nshould be dazzled by the title\xe2\x80\x94maybe even unconsciously, you being\r\nEnglish\xe2\x80\x94and that you might be deceiving yourself in thinking you loved\r\nonly me, and find you didn\xe2\x80\x99t love me when the deception was swept away;\r\nso it makes me proud that the revelation stands for nothing and that\r\nyou _do_ love just me, only me\xe2\x80\x94oh, prouder than any words can tell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only you, sweetheart, I never gave one envying glance toward\r\nyour father\xe2\x80\x99s earldom. That is utterly true, dear Gwendolen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x94you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t call me that. I hate that false name. I told you it\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t mine. My name is Sally Sellers\xe2\x80\x94or Sarah, if you like. From this\r\ntime I banish dreams, visions, imaginings, and will no more of them. I\r\nam going to be myself\xe2\x80\x94my genuine self, my honest self, my natural self,\r\nclear and clean of sham and folly and fraud, and worthy of you. There\r\nis no grain of social inequality between us; I, like you, am poor; I,\r\nlike you, am without position or distinction; you are a struggling\r\nartist, I am that, too, in my humbler way. Our bread is honest bread,\r\nwe work for our living. Hand in hand we will walk hence to the grave,\r\nhelping each other in all ways, living for each other, being and\r\nremaining one in heart and purpose, one in hope and aspiration,\r\ninseparable to the end. And though our place is low, judged by the\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x99s eye, we will make it as high as the highest in the great\r\nessentials of honest work for what we eat and wear, and conduct above\r\nreproach. We live in a land, let us be thankful, where this is\r\nall-sufficient, and no man is better than his neighbor by the grace of\r\nGod, but only by his own merit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy tried to break in, but she stopped him and kept the floor\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not through yet. I am going to purge myself of the last vestiges\r\nof artificiality and pretence, and then start fair on your own honest\r\nlevel and be worthy mate to you thenceforth. My father honestly thinks\r\nhe is an earl. Well, leave him his dream, it pleases him and does no\r\none any harm: It was the dream of his ancestors before him. It has made\r\nfools of the house of Sellers for generations, and it made something of\r\na fool of me, but took no deep root. I am done with it now, and for\r\ngood. Forty-eight hours ago I was privately proud of being the daughter\r\nof a pinchbeck earl, and thought the proper mate for me must be a man\r\nof like degree; but to-day\xe2\x80\x94oh, how grateful I am for your love which\r\nhas healed my sick brain and restored my sanity!\xe2\x80\x94I could make oath that\r\nno earl\xe2\x80\x99s son in all the world\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x94well, but\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you look like a person in a panic. What is it? What is the\r\nmatter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatter? Oh, nothing\xe2\x80\x94nothing. I was only going to say\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but in his\r\nflurry nothing occurred to him to say, for a moment; then by a lucky\r\ninspiration he thought of something entirely sufficient for the\r\noccasion, and brought it out with eloquent force: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, how beautiful\r\nyou are! You take my breath away when you look like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was well conceived, well timed, and cordially delivered\xe2\x80\x94and it got\r\nits reward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see. Where was I? Yes, my father\xe2\x80\x99s earldom is pure moonshine.\r\nLook at those dreadful things on the wall. You have of course supposed\r\nthem to be portraits of his ancestors, earls of Rossmore. Well, they\r\nare not. They are chromos of distinguished Americans\xe2\x80\x94all moderns; but\r\nhe has carried them back a thousand years by re-labeling them. Andrew\r\nJackson there, is doing what he can to be the late American earl; and\r\nthe newest treasure in the collection is supposed to be the young\r\nEnglish heir\xe2\x80\x94I mean the idiot with the crape; but in truth it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nshoemaker, and not Lord Berkeley at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy of course I am. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause his conduct in his last moments, when the fire was sweeping\r\naround him shows that he was a man. It shows that he was a fine,\r\nhigh-souled young creature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy was strongly moved by these compliments, and it seemed to him\r\nthat the girl\xe2\x80\x99s lovely lips took on a new loveliness when they were\r\ndelivering them. He said, softly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a pity he could not know what a gracious impression his behavior\r\nwas going to leave with the dearest and sweetest stranger in the land\r\nof\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I almost loved him! Why, I think of him every day. He is always\r\nfloating about in my mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy felt that this was a little more than was necessary. He was\r\nconscious of the sting of jealousy. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite right to think of him\xe2\x80\x94at least now and then\xe2\x80\x94that is, at\r\nintervals\xe2\x80\x94in perhaps an admiring way\xe2\x80\x94but it seems to me that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoward Tracy, are you jealous of that dead man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was ashamed\xe2\x80\x94and at the same time not ashamed. He was jealous\xe2\x80\x94and at\r\nthe same time he was not jealous. In a sense the dead man was himself;\r\nin that case compliments and affection lavished upon that corpse went\r\ninto his own till and were clear profit. But in another sense the dead\r\nman was not himself; and in that case all compliments and affection\r\nlavished there were wasted, and a sufficient basis for jealousy. A tiff\r\nwas the result of the dispute between the two. Then they made it up,\r\nand were more loving than ever. As an affectionate clincher of the\r\nreconciliation, Sally declared that she had now banished Lord Berkeley\r\nfrom her mind; and added, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd in order to make sure that he shall\r\nnever make trouble between us again, I will teach myself to detest that\r\nname and all that have ever borne it or ever shall bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis inflicted another pang, and Tracy was minded to ask her to modify\r\nthat a little just on general principles, and as practice in not\r\noverdoing a good thing\xe2\x80\x94perhaps he might better leave things as they\r\nwere and not risk bringing on another tiff. He got away from that\r\nparticular, and sought less tender ground for conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you disapprove wholly of aristocracies and nobilities, now\r\nthat you have renounced your title and your father\xe2\x80\x99s earldom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Real_ ones? Oh, dear no\xe2\x80\x94but I\xe2\x80\x99ve thrown aside our sham one for good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis answer fell just at the right time and just in the right place, to\r\nsave the poor unstable young man from changing his political complexion\r\nonce more. He had been on the point of beginning to totter again, but\r\nthis prop shored him up and kept him from floundering back into\r\ndemocracy and re-renouncing aristocracy. So he went home glad that he\r\nhad asked the fortunate question. The girl would accept a little thing\r\nlike a genuine earldom, she was merely prejudiced against the brummagem\r\narticle. Yes, he could have his girl and have his earldom, too: that\r\nquestion was a fortunate stroke.\r\n\r\nSally went to bed happy, too; and remained happy, deliriously happy,\r\nfor nearly two hours; but at last, just as she was sinking into a\r\ncontented and luxurious unconsciousness, the shady devil who lives and\r\nlurks and hides and watches inside of human beings and is always\r\nwaiting for a chance to do the proprietor a malicious damage, whispered\r\nto her soul and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat question had a harmless look, but what was\r\n_back_ of it?\xe2\x80\x94what was the secret motive of it?\xe2\x80\x94what suggested it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shady devil had knifed her, and could retire, now, and take a rest;\r\nthe wound would attend to business for him. And it did.\r\n\r\n\r\np234.jpg (24K)\r\n\r\n_Why_ should Howard Tracy ask that question? If he was not trying to\r\nmarry her for the sake of her rank, what should suggest that question\r\nto him? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t he plainly look gratified when she said her objections\r\nto aristocracy had their limitations? Ah, he is after that earldom,\r\nthat gilded sham\xe2\x80\x94it isn\xe2\x80\x99t poor me he wants.\r\n\r\nSo she argued, in anguish and tears. Then she argued the opposite\r\ntheory, but made a weak, poor business of it, and lost the case. She\r\nkept the arguing up, one side and then the other, the rest of the\r\nnight, and at last fell asleep at dawn; fell in the fire at dawn, one\r\nmay say; for that kind of sleep resembles fire, and one comes out of it\r\nwith his brain baked and his physical forces fried out of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTracy wrote his father before he sought his bed. He wrote a letter\r\nwhich he believed would get better treatment than his cablegram\r\nreceived, for it contained what ought to be welcome news; namely, that\r\nhe had tried equality and working for a living; had made a fight which\r\nhe could find no reason to be ashamed of, and in the matter of earning\r\na living had proved that he was able to do it; but that on the whole he\r\nhad arrived at the conclusion that he could not reform the world\r\nsingle-handed, and was willing to retire from the conflict with the\r\nfair degree of honor which he had gained, and was also willing to\r\nreturn home and resume his position and be content with it and thankful\r\nfor it for the future, leaving further experiment of a missionary sort\r\nto other young people needing the chastening and quelling persuasions\r\nof experience, the only logic sure to convince a diseased imagination\r\nand restore it to rugged health. Then he approached the subject of\r\nmarriage with the daughter of the American Claimant with a good deal of\r\ncaution and much painstaking art. He said praiseful and appreciative\r\nthings about the girl, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t dwell upon that detail or make it\r\nprominent. The thing which he made prominent was the opportunity now so\r\nhappily afforded, to reconcile York and Lancaster, graft the warring\r\nroses upon one stem, and end forever a crying injustice which had\r\nalready lasted far too long. One could infer that he had thought this\r\nthing all out and chosen this way of making all things fair and right\r\nbecause it was sufficiently fair and considerably wiser than the\r\nrenunciation-scheme which he had brought with him from England. One\r\ncould infer that, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t say it. In fact the more he read his\r\nletter over, the more he got to inferring it himself.\r\n\r\nWhen the old earl received that letter, the first part of it filled him\r\nwith a grim and snarly satisfaction; but the rest of it brought a snort\r\nor two out of him that could be translated differently. He wasted no\r\nink in this emergency, either in cablegrams or letters; he promptly\r\ntook ship for America to look into the matter himself. He had staunchly\r\nheld his grip all this long time, and given no sign of the hunger at\r\nhis heart to see his son; hoping for the cure of his insane dream, and\r\nresolute that the process should go through all the necessary stages\r\nwithout assuaging telegrams or other nonsense from home, and here was\r\nvictory at last. Victory, but stupidly marred by this idiotic marriage\r\nproject. Yes, he would step over and take a hand in this matter\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nDuring the first ten days following the mailing of the letter Tracy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspirits had no idle time; they were always climbing up into the clouds\r\nor sliding down into the earth as deep as the law of gravitation\r\nreached. He was intensely happy or intensely miserable by turns,\r\naccording to Miss Sally\xe2\x80\x99s moods. He never could tell when the mood was\r\ngoing to change, and when it changed he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell what it was that\r\nhad changed it. Sometimes she was so in love with him that her love was\r\ntropical, torrid, and she could find no language fervent enough for its\r\nexpression; then suddenly, and without warning or any apparent reason,\r\nthe weather would change, and the victim would find himself adrift\r\namong the icebergs and feeling as lonesome and friendless as the north\r\npole. It sometimes seemed to him that a man might better be dead than\r\nexposed to these devastating varieties of climate.\r\n\r\nThe case was simple. Sally _wanted_ to believe that Tracy\xe2\x80\x99s preference\r\nwas disinterested; so she was always applying little tests of one sort\r\nor another, hoping and expecting that they would bring out evidence\r\nwhich would confirm or fortify her belief. Poor Tracy did not know that\r\nthese experiments were being made upon him, consequently he walked\r\npromptly into all the traps the girl set for him. These traps consisted\r\nin apparently casual references to social distinction, aristocratic\r\ntitle and privilege, and such things. Often Tracy responded to these\r\nreferences heedlessly and not much caring what he said provided it kept\r\nthe talk going and prolonged the seance. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t suspect that the\r\ngirl was watching his face and listening for his words as one who\r\nwatches the judge\xe2\x80\x99s face and listens for the words which will restore\r\nhim to home and friends and freedom or shut him away from the sun and\r\nhuman companionship forever. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t suspect that his careless words\r\nwere being weighed, and so he often delivered sentence of death when it\r\nwould have been just as handy and all the same to him to pronounce\r\nacquittal. Daily he broke the girl\xe2\x80\x99s heart, nightly he sent her to the\r\nrack for sleep. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand it.\r\n\r\nSome people would have put this and that together and perceived that\r\nthe weather never changed until one particular subject was introduced,\r\nand that then it _always_ changed. And they would have looked further,\r\nand perceived that that subject was always introduced by the one party,\r\nnever the other. They would have argued, then, that this was done for a\r\npurpose. If they could not find out what that purpose was in any\r\nsimpler or easier way, they would _ask_.\r\n\r\nBut Tracy was not deep enough or suspicious enough to think of these\r\nthings. He noticed only one particular; that the weather was always\r\nsunny when a visit _began_. No matter how much it might cloud up later,\r\nit always began with a clear sky. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t explain this curious fact\r\nto himself, he merely knew it to be a fact. The truth of the matter\r\nwas, that by the time Tracy had been out of Sally\xe2\x80\x99s sight six hours she\r\nwas so famishing for a sight of him that her doubts and suspicions were\r\nall consumed away in the fire of that longing, and so always she came\r\ninto his presence as surprisingly radiant and joyous as she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t when\r\nshe went out of it.\r\n\r\nIn circumstances like these a growing portrait runs a good many risks.\r\nThe portrait of Sellers, by Tracy, was fighting along, day by day,\r\nthrough this mixed weather, and daily adding to itself ineradicable\r\nsigns of the checkered life it was leading. It was the happiest\r\nportrait, in spots, that was ever seen; but in other spots a damned\r\nsoul looked out from it; a soul that was suffering all the different\r\nkinds of distress there are, from stomach ache to rabies. But Sellers\r\nliked it. He said it was just himself all over\xe2\x80\x94a portrait that sweated\r\nmoods from every pore, and no two moods alike. He said he had as many\r\ndifferent kinds of emotions in him as a jug.\r\n\r\nIt was a kind of a deadly work of art, maybe, but it was a starchy\r\npicture for show; for it was life size, full length, and represented\r\nthe American earl in a peer\xe2\x80\x99s scarlet robe, with the three ermine bars\r\nindicative of an earl\xe2\x80\x99s rank, and on the gray head an earl\xe2\x80\x99s coronet,\r\ntilted just a wee bit to one side in a most gallus and winsome way.\r\nWhen Sally\xe2\x80\x99s weather was sunny the portrait made Tracy chuckle, but\r\nwhen her weather was overcast it disordered his mind and stopped the\r\ncirculation of his blood.\r\n\r\nLate one night when the sweethearts had been having a flawless visit\r\ntogether, Sally\xe2\x80\x99s interior devil began to work his specialty, and soon\r\nthe conversation was drifting toward the customary rock. Presently, in\r\nthe midst of Tracy\xe2\x80\x99s serene flow of talk, he felt a shudder which he\r\nknew was not his shudder, but exterior to his breast although\r\nimmediately against it. After the shudder came sobs; Sally was crying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my darling, what have I done\xe2\x80\x94what have I said? It has happened\r\nagain! What _have_ I done to wound you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe disengaged herself from his arms and gave him a look of deep\r\nreproach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you done? I will tell you what you have done. You have\r\nunwittingly revealed\xe2\x80\x94oh, for the twentieth time, though I _could_ not\r\nbelieve it, _would_ not believe it!\xe2\x80\x94that it is not me you love, but\r\nthat foolish sham, my father\xe2\x80\x99s imitation earldom; and you have broken\r\nmy heart!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my child, what are you saying! I never dreamed of such a thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Howard, Howard, the things you have uttered when you were\r\nforgetting to guard your tongue, have betrayed you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThings I have uttered when I was _forgetting_ to guard my tongue?\r\nThese are hard words. When have I _remembered_ to guard it? Never in\r\none instance. It has no office but to speak the truth. It needs no\r\nguarding for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoward, I have noted your words and weighed them, when you were not\r\nthinking of their significance\xe2\x80\x94and they have told me more than you\r\nmeant they should.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say you have answered the trust I had in you by using\r\nit as an ambuscade from which you could set snares for my unsuspecting\r\ntongue and be safe from detection while you did it? You have not done\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94surely you have not done this thing. Oh, one\xe2\x80\x99s enemy could not do\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was an aspect of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s conduct which she had not clearly\r\nperceived before. Was it treachery? Had she abused a trust? The thought\r\ncrimsoned her cheeks with shame and remorse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, forgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI did not know what I was doing. I have\r\nbeen so tortured\xe2\x80\x94you _will_ forgive me, you _must;_ I have suffered so\r\nmuch, and I am so sorry and so humble; you _do_ forgive me, _don\xe2\x80\x99t_\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t turn away, don\xe2\x80\x99t refuse me; it is only my love that is at\r\nfault, and you _know_ I love you, love you with all my heart; I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to\xe2\x80\x94oh, dear, dear, I am so miserable, and I _never_ meant\r\nany harm, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see where this insanity was carrying me, and how\r\nit was wronging and abusing the dearest heart in all the world to\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94oh, take me in your arms again, I have no other refuge, no\r\nother home and hope!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was reconciliation again\xe2\x80\x94immediate, perfect, all-embracing\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwith it utter happiness. This would have been a good time to adjourn.\r\nBut no, now that the cloud-breeder was revealed at last; now that it\r\nwas manifest that all the sour weather had come from this girl\xe2\x80\x99s dread\r\nthat Tracy was lured by her rank and not herself, he resolved to lay\r\nthat ghost immediately and permanently by furnishing the best possible\r\nproof that he _couldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ have had back of him at any time the suspected\r\nmotive. So he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me whisper a little secret in your ear\xe2\x80\x94a secret which I have kept\r\nshut up in my breast all this time. Your rank _couldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ ever have been\r\nan enticement. I am son and heir to an English earl!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl stared at him\xe2\x80\x94one, two, three moments, maybe a dozen\xe2\x80\x94then her\r\nlips parted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and moved away from him, still gazing at him in a kind\r\nof blank amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94why, certainly I am. Why do you act like this? What have I done\r\n_now?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you done? You have certainly made a most strange statement.\r\nYou must see that yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d with a timid little laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cit may be a strange enough\r\nstatement; but of what consequence is that, if it is true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_If_ it is true. You are already retiring from it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, not for a moment! You should not say that. I have not deserved it.\r\nI have spoken the truth; why do you doubt it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer reply was prompt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimply because you didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak it earlier!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a groan, exactly, but it was an intelligible enough\r\nexpression of the fact that he saw the point and recognized that there\r\nwas reason in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have seemed to conceal nothing from me that I ought to know\r\nconcerning yourself, and you were not privileged to keep back such a\r\nthing as this from me a moment after\xe2\x80\x94after\xe2\x80\x94well, after you had\r\ndetermined to pay your court to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIts true, it\xe2\x80\x99s true, I know it! But there were circumstances\xe2\x80\x94in\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94circumstances which\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waved the circumstances aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pleadingly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou seemed so bent on our\r\ntraveling the proud path of honest labor and honorable poverty, that I\r\nwas terrified\xe2\x80\x94that is, I was afraid\xe2\x80\x94of\xe2\x80\x94of\xe2\x80\x94well, _you_ know how you\r\ntalked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know how I talked. And I also know that before the talk was\r\nfinished you inquired how I stood as regards aristocracies, and my\r\nanswer was calculated to relieve your fears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent a while. Then he said, in a discouraged way:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see any way out of it. It was a mistake. That is in truth all\r\nit was, just a mistake. No harm was meant, no harm in the world. I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t see how it might some time look. It is my way. I don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to\r\nsee far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl was almost disarmed, for a moment. Then she flared up again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn Earl\xe2\x80\x99s son! Do earls\xe2\x80\x99 sons go about working in lowly callings for\r\ntheir bread and butter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod knows they don\xe2\x80\x99t! I have wished they did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo earls\xe2\x80\x99 sons sink their degree in a country like this, and come\r\nsober and decent to sue for the hand of a born child of poverty when\r\nthey can go drunk, profane, and steeped in dishonorable debt and buy\r\nthe pick and choice of the millionaires\xe2\x80\x99 daughters of America? _You_ an\r\nearl\xe2\x80\x99s son! Show me the signs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\np243.jpg (29K)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank God I am not able\xe2\x80\x94if those are the signs. But yet I am an\r\nearl\xe2\x80\x99s son and heir. It is all I can say. I wish you would believe me,\r\nbut you will not. I know no way to persuade you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was about to soften again, but his closing remark made her bring\r\nher foot down with smart vexation, and she cried out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you drive all patience out of me! Would you have one believe that\r\nyou haven\xe2\x80\x99t your proofs at hand, and yet are what you say you are? You\r\ndo not put your hand in your pocket _now_\xe2\x80\x94for you have nothing there.\r\nYou make a claim like this, and then venture to travel without\r\ncredentials. These are simply incredibilities. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see that,\r\nyourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe cast about in his mind for a defence of some kind or other\xe2\x80\x94hesitated\r\na little, and then said, with difficulty and diffidence:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you just the truth, foolish as it will seem to you\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nanybody, I suppose\xe2\x80\x94but it _is_ the truth. I had an ideal\xe2\x80\x94call it a\r\ndream, a folly, if you will\xe2\x80\x94but I wanted to renounce the privileges and\r\nunfair advantages enjoyed by the nobility and wrung from the nation by\r\nforce and fraud, and purge myself of my share of those crimes against\r\nright and reason, by thenceforth comrading with the poor and humble on\r\nequal terms, earning with my own hands the bread I ate, and rising by\r\nmy own merit if I rose at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young girl scanned his face narrowly while he spoke; and there was\r\nsomething about his simplicity of manner and statement which touched\r\nher \xe2\x80\x94touched her almost to the danger point; but she set her grip on\r\nthe yielding spirit and choked it to quiescence; it could not be wise\r\nto surrender to compassion or any kind of sentiment, yet; she must ask\r\none or two more questions. Tracy was reading her face; and what he read\r\nthere lifted his drooping hopes a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn earl\xe2\x80\x99s son to do that! Why, he were a man! A man to love!\xe2\x80\x94oh, more,\r\na man to worship!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he never lived! He is not born, he will not be born. The\r\nself-abnegation that could do that\xe2\x80\x94even in utter folly, and hopeless of\r\nconveying benefit to any, beyond the mere example\xe2\x80\x94could be mistaken for\r\ngreatness; why, it would _be_ greatness in this cold age of sordid\r\nideals! A moment\xe2\x80\x94wait\xe2\x80\x94let me finish; I have one question more. Your\r\nfather is earl of what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRossmore\xe2\x80\x94and I am Viscount Berkeley!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fat was in the fire again. The girl felt so outraged that it was\r\ndifficult for her to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow _can_ you venture such a brazen thing! You know that he is dead,\r\nand you know that I know it. Oh, to rob the living of name and honors\r\nfor a selfish and temporary advantage is crime enough, but to rob the\r\ndefenceless dead\xe2\x80\x94why it is more than crime, it _degrades_ crime!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, listen to me\xe2\x80\x94just a word\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t turn away like that. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nleave me, so\xe2\x80\x94stay one moment. On my honor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, on your honor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my honor I am what I say! And I will prove it, and you will\r\nbelieve, I know you will. I will bring you a message\xe2\x80\x94a cablegram\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow\xe2\x80\x94next day\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSigned \xe2\x80\x98Rossmore\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94signed Rossmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will that prove?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will it prove? What _should_ it prove?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you force me to say it\xe2\x80\x94possibly the presence of a confederate\r\nsomewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a hard blow, and staggered him. He said, dejectedly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true. I did not think of it. Oh, my God, I do not know any way\r\nto do; I do everything wrong. You are going?\xe2\x80\x94and you won\xe2\x80\x99t say even\r\ngood-night\xe2\x80\x94or good-bye? Ah, we have not parted like this before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I _want_ to run and\xe2\x80\x94no, go, now.\xe2\x80\x9d A pause\xe2\x80\x94then she said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou may\r\nbring the message when it comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, may I? God bless you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was gone; and none too soon; her lips were already quivering, and\r\nnow she broke down. Through her sobbings her words broke from time to\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he is gone. I have lost him, I shall never see him any more. And\r\nhe didn\xe2\x80\x99t kiss me good-bye; never even offered to force a kiss from me,\r\nand he _knowing_ it was the very, very last, and I expecting he would,\r\nand never _dreaming_ he would treat me so after all we have been to\r\neach other. Oh, oh, oh, oh, what shall I do, what _shall_ I do! He is a\r\ndear, poor, miserable, good-hearted, transparent liar and humbug, but\r\noh, I _do_ love him so\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d After a little she broke into speech again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dear he is! and I shall miss him so, I shall miss him so! Why\r\n_won\xe2\x80\x99t_ he ever think to _forge_ a message and fetch it?\xe2\x80\x94but no, he\r\nnever will, he never thinks of anything; he\xe2\x80\x99s so honest and simple it\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever occur to him. Oh, what _did_ possess him to think he\r\ncould succeed as a fraud\xe2\x80\x94and he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the first requisite except\r\nduplicity that I can see. Oh, dear, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to bed and give it all up.\r\nOh, I _wish_ I had told him to come and tell me whenever he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nany telegram\xe2\x80\x94and now it\xe2\x80\x99s all my own fault if I never see him again.\r\nHow my eyes must look!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day, sure enough, the cablegram didn\xe2\x80\x99t come. This was an immense\r\ndisaster; for Tracy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go into the presence without that ticket,\r\nalthough it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to possess any value as evidence. But if the\r\nfailure of the cablegram on that first day may be called an immense\r\ndisaster, where is the dictionary that can turn out a phrase sizeable\r\nenough to describe the tenth day\xe2\x80\x99s failure? Of course every day that\r\nthe cablegram didn\xe2\x80\x99t come made Tracy all of twenty-four hours\xe2\x80\x99 more\r\nashamed of himself than he was the day before, and made Sally fully\r\ntwenty-four hours more certain than ever that he not only hadn\xe2\x80\x99t any\r\nfather anywhere, but hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even a confederate\xe2\x80\x94and so it followed that\r\nhe was a double-dyed humbug and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be otherwise.\r\n\r\nThese were hard days for Barrow and the art firm. All these had their\r\nhands full, trying to comfort Tracy. Barrow\xe2\x80\x99s task was particularly\r\nhard, because he was made a confidant in full, and therefore had to\r\nhumor Tracy\xe2\x80\x99s delusion that he had a father, and that the father was an\r\nearl, and that he was going to send a cablegram. Barrow early gave up\r\nthe idea of trying to convince Tracy that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t any father, because\r\nthis had such a bad effect on the patient, and worked up his temper to\r\nsuch an alarming degree. He had tried, as an experiment, letting Tracy\r\nthink he had a father; the result was so good that he went further,\r\nwith proper caution, and tried letting him think his father was an\r\nearl; this wrought so well, that he grew bold, and tried letting him\r\nthink he had two fathers, if he wanted to, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to, so\r\nBarrow withdrew one of them and substituted letting him think he was\r\ngoing to get a cablegram\xe2\x80\x94which Barrow judged he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, and was\r\nright; but Barrow worked the cablegram daily for all it was worth, and\r\nit was the one thing that kept Tracy alive; that was Barrow\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.\r\n\r\nAnd these were bitter hard days for poor Sally, and mainly delivered up\r\nto private crying. She kept her furniture pretty damp, and so caught\r\ncold, and the dampness and the cold and the sorrow together undermined\r\nher appetite, and she was a pitiful enough object, poor thing. Her\r\nstate was bad enough, as per statement of it above quoted; but all the\r\nforces of nature and circumstance seemed conspiring to make it\r\nworse\xe2\x80\x94and succeeding. For instance, the morning after her dismissal of\r\nTracy, Hawkins and Sellers read in the associated press dispatches that\r\na toy puzzle called Pigs in the Clover, had come into sudden favor\r\nwithin the past few weeks, and that from the Atlantic to the Pacific\r\nall the populations of all the States had knocked off work to play with\r\nit, and that the business of the country had now come to a standstill\r\nby consequence; that judges, lawyers, burglars, parsons, thieves,\r\nmerchants, mechanics, murderers, women, children, babies\xe2\x80\x94everybody,\r\nindeed, could be seen from morning till midnight, absorbed in one deep\r\nproject and purpose, and only one\xe2\x80\x94to pen those pigs, work out that\r\npuzzle successfully; that all gayety, all cheerfulness had departed\r\nfrom the nation, and in its place care, preoccupation and anxiety sat\r\nupon every countenance, and all faces were drawn, distressed, and\r\nfurrowed with the signs of age and trouble, and marked with the still\r\nsadder signs of mental decay and incipient madness; that factories were\r\nat work night and day in eight cities, and yet to supply the demand for\r\nthe puzzle was thus far impossible. Hawkins was wild with joy, but\r\nSellers was calm. Small matters could not disturb his serenity. He\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just the way things go. A man invents a thing which could\r\nrevolutionize the arts, produce mountains of money, and bless the\r\nearth, and who will bother with it or show any interest in it?\xe2\x80\x94and so\r\nyou are just as poor as you were before. But you invent some worthless\r\nthing to amuse yourself with, and would throw it away if let alone, and\r\nall of a sudden the whole world makes a snatch for it and out crops a\r\nfortune. Hunt up that Yankee and collect, Hawkins\xe2\x80\x94half is yours, you\r\nknow. Leave me to potter at my lecture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a temperance lecture. Sellers was head chief in the Temperance\r\ncamp, and had lectured, now and then in that interest, but had been\r\ndissatisfied with his efforts; wherefore he was now about to try a new\r\nplan. After much thought he had concluded that a main reason why his\r\nlectures lacked fire or something, was that they were too transparently\r\namateurish; that is to say, it was probably too plainly perceptible\r\nthat the lecturer was trying to tell people about the horrid effects of\r\nliquor when he didn\xe2\x80\x99t really know anything about those effects except\r\nfrom hearsay, since he had hardly ever tasted an intoxicant in his\r\nlife. His scheme, now, was to prepare himself to speak from bitter\r\nexperience. Hawkins was to stand by with the bottle, calculate the\r\ndoses, watch the effects, make notes of results, and otherwise assist\r\nin the preparation. Time was short, for the ladies would be along about\r\nnoon\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, the temperance organization called the Daughters\r\nof Siloam\xe2\x80\x94and Sellers must be ready to head the procession.\r\n\r\nThe time kept slipping along\xe2\x80\x94Hawkins did not return\xe2\x80\x94Sellers could not\r\nventure to wait longer; so he attacked the bottle himself, and\r\nproceeded to note the effects. Hawkins got back at last; took one\r\ncomprehensive glance at the lecturer, and went down and headed off the\r\nprocession. The ladies were grieved to hear that the champion had been\r\ntaken suddenly ill and violently so, but glad to hear that it was hoped\r\nhe would be out again in a few days.\r\n\r\nAs it turned out, the old gentleman didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn over or show any signs\r\nof life worth speaking of for twenty-four hours. Then he asked after\r\nthe procession, and learned what had happened about it. He was sorry;\r\nsaid he had been \xe2\x80\x9cfixed\xe2\x80\x9d for it. He remained abed several days, and his\r\nwife and daughter took turns in sitting with him and ministering to his\r\nwants. Often he patted Sally\xe2\x80\x99s head and tried to comfort her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t cry, my child, don\xe2\x80\x99t cry so; _you_ know your old father did it\r\nby mistake and didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean a bit of harm; you know he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nintentionally do anything to make you ashamed for the world; you know\r\nhe was trying to do good and only made the mistake through ignorance,\r\nnot knowing the right doses and Washington not there to help. Don\xe2\x80\x99t cry\r\nso, dear, it breaks my old heart to see you, and think I\xe2\x80\x99ve brought\r\nthis humiliation on you and you so dear to me and so good. I won\xe2\x80\x99t ever\r\ndo it again, indeed I won\xe2\x80\x99t; now be comforted, honey, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good\r\nchild.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut when she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on duty at the bedside the crying went on just the\r\nsame; then the mother would try to comfort her, and say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t cry, dear, _he_ never meant any harm; it was all one of those\r\nhappens that you can\xe2\x80\x99t guard against when you are trying experiments,\r\nthat way. You see _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t cry. It\xe2\x80\x99s because I know him so well. I\r\ncould never look anybody in the face again if he had got into such an\r\namazing condition as that a-purpose; but bless you his intention was\r\npure and high, and that makes the _act_ pure, though it was higher than\r\nwas necessary. We\xe2\x80\x99re not humiliated, dear, he did it under a noble\r\nimpulse and we don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be ashamed. There, don\xe2\x80\x99t cry any more,\r\nhoney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus, the old gentleman was useful to Sally, during several days, as an\r\nexplanation of her tearfulness. She felt thankful to him for the\r\nshelter he was affording her, but often said to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a shame\r\nto let him see in my crying a reproach\xe2\x80\x94as if he could ever do anything\r\nthat could make me reproach him! But I can\xe2\x80\x99t confess; I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go on\r\nusing him for a pretext, he\xe2\x80\x99s the only one I\xe2\x80\x99ve got in the world, and I\r\ndo need one so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as Sellers was out again, and found that stacks of money had\r\nbeen placed in bank for him and Hawkins by the Yankee, he said, \xe2\x80\x9c_Now_\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll soon see who\xe2\x80\x99s the Claimant and who\xe2\x80\x99s the Authentic. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just go\r\nover there and warm up that House of Lords.\xe2\x80\x9d During the next few days\r\nhe and his wife were so busy with preparations for the voyage that\r\nSally had all the privacy she needed, and all the chance to cry that\r\nwas good for her. Then the old pair left for New York\xe2\x80\x94and England.\r\n\r\nSally had also had a chance to do another thing. That was, to make up\r\nher mind that life was not worth living upon the present terms. If she\r\n_must_ give up her impostor and die, doubtless she must submit; but\r\nmight she not lay her whole case before some disinterested person,\r\nfirst, and see if there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t perhaps some saving way out of the\r\nmatter? She turned this idea over in her mind a good deal. In her first\r\nvisit with Hawkins after her parents were gone, the talk fell upon\r\nTracy, and she was impelled to set her case before the statesman and\r\ntake his counsel. So she poured out her heart, and he listened with\r\npainful solicitude. She concluded, pleadingly, with\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Don\xe2\x80\x99t_ tell me he is an impostor. I suppose he is, but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it\r\nlook to you as if he isn\xe2\x80\x99t? You are cool, you know, and outside; and\r\nso, maybe it can look to you as if he isn\xe2\x80\x99t one, when it can\xe2\x80\x99t to me.\r\n_Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t_ it look to you as if he isn\xe2\x80\x99t? Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you\xe2\x80\x94_can\xe2\x80\x99t_ it look\r\nto you that way\xe2\x80\x94for\xe2\x80\x94for my sake?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor man was troubled, but he felt obliged to keep in the\r\nneighborhood of the truth. He fought around the present detail a little\r\nwhile, then gave it up and said he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t really see his way to\r\nclearing Tracy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe truth is, he\xe2\x80\x99s an impostor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is, you\xe2\x80\x94you feel a little certain, but not entirely\xe2\x80\x94oh, not\r\n_entirely_, Mr. Hawkins!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pity to have to say it\xe2\x80\x94I do hate to say it, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nanything about it, I know he\xe2\x80\x99s an impostor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, now, Mr. Hawkins, you _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ go that far. A body _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ really\r\nknow it, you know. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t _proved_ that he\xe2\x80\x99s not what he says he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShould he come out and make a clean breast of the whole wretched\r\nbusiness? Yes\xe2\x80\x94at least the most of it\xe2\x80\x94it ought to be done. So he set\r\nhis teeth and went at the matter with determination, but purposing to\r\nspare the girl one pain\xe2\x80\x94that of knowing that Tracy was a criminal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I am going to tell you a plain tale; one not pleasant for me to\r\ntell or for you to hear, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to stand it. I know all about\r\nthat fellow; and I _know_ he is no earl\xe2\x80\x99s son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl\xe2\x80\x99s eyes flashed, and she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care a snap for that\xe2\x80\x94go on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was so wholly unexpected that it at once obstructed the narrative;\r\nHawkins was not even sure that he had heard aright. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I quite understand. Do you mean to say that if he\r\nwas all right and proper otherwise you\xe2\x80\x99d be indifferent about the earl\r\npart of the business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d be entirely satisfied with him and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t _care_ for his not\r\nbeing an earl\xe2\x80\x99s son,\xe2\x80\x94that _being_ an earl\xe2\x80\x99s son wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t add any value\r\nto him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the least value that I would care for. Why, Mr. Hawkins, I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngotten over all that day-dreaming about earldoms and aristocracies and\r\nall such nonsense and am become just a plain ordinary nobody and\r\ncontent with it; and it is to _him_ I owe my cure. And as to anything\r\nbeing able to add a value to him, nothing can do that. He is the whole\r\nworld to me, just as he is; he comprehends _all_ the values there\r\nare\xe2\x80\x94then how can you _add_ one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s pretty far gone.\xe2\x80\x9d He said that to himself. He continued, still\r\nto himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI must change my plan again; I can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to strike one\r\nthat will stand the requirements of this most variegated emergency five\r\nminutes on a stretch. Without making this fellow a criminal, I believe\r\nI will invent a name and a character for him calculated to disenchant\r\nher. If it fails to do it, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll know that the next rightest thing\r\nto do will be to help her to her fate, poor thing, not hinder her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThen he said aloud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Gwendolen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to be called Sally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad of it; I like it better, myself. Well, then, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you\r\nabout this man Snodgrass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSnodgrass! Is _that_ his name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94Snodgrass. The other\xe2\x80\x99s his nom de plume.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hideous!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it is, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t help our names.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is truly his real name\xe2\x80\x94and not Howard Tracy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHawkins answered, regretfully:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it seems a pity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl sampled the name musingly, once or twice\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSnodgrass. Snodgrass. No, I could not endure that. I could not get\r\nused to it. No, I should call him by his first name. What is his first\r\nname?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94his initials are S. M.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis initials? I don\xe2\x80\x99t care anything about his initials. I can\xe2\x80\x99t call\r\nhim by his initials. What do they _stand_ for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see, his father was a physician, and he\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x94well he was an\r\nidolater of his profession, and he\xe2\x80\x94well, he was a very eccentric man,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do they _stand_ for! What are you shuffling about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x94well they stand for Spinal Meningitis. His father being a phy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never heard such an infamous name! Nobody can ever call a person\r\n_that_\xe2\x80\x94a person they love. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call an enemy by such a name. It\r\nsounds like an epithet.\xe2\x80\x9d After a moment, she added with a kind of\r\nconsternation, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it would be _my_ name! Letters would come with it\r\non.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Spinal Meningitis Snodgrass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t repeat it\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t; I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it. Was the father a lunatic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that is not charged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad of that, because that is transmissible. What do you think\r\n_was_ the matter with him, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really know. The family used to run a good deal to\r\nidiots, and so, maybe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t any maybe about it. This one was an idiot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes\xe2\x80\x94he could have been. He was suspected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuspected!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sally, with irritation. \xe2\x80\x9cWould one _suspect_ there\r\nwas going to be a dark time if he saw the constellations fall out of\r\nthe sky? But that is enough about the idiot, I don\xe2\x80\x99t take any interest\r\nin idiots; tell me about the son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then, this one was the eldest, but not the favorite. His\r\nbrother, Zylobalsamum\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait\xe2\x80\x94give me a chance to realize that. It is perfectly stupefying.\r\nZylo\xe2\x80\x94what did you call it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cZylobalsamum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never heard such a name: It sounds like a disease. Is it a disease?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a disease. It\xe2\x80\x99s either Scriptural or\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s not Scriptural.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it\xe2\x80\x99s anatomical. I knew it was one or the other. Yes, I remember,\r\nnow, it _is_ anatomical. It\xe2\x80\x99s a ganglion\xe2\x80\x94a nerve centre\xe2\x80\x94it is what is\r\ncalled the zylobalsamum process.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, go on; and if you come to any more of them, omit the names; they\r\nmake one feel so uncomfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then. As I said, this one was not a favorite in the family,\r\nand so he was neglected in every way, never sent to school, always\r\nallowed to associate with the worst and coarsest characters, and so of\r\ncourse he has grown up a rude, vulgar, ignorant, dissipated ruffian,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe? It\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing! You ought to be more generous than to make\r\nsuch a statement as that about a poor young stranger who\xe2\x80\x94who\xe2\x80\x94why, he is\r\nthe very opposite of that! He is considerate, courteous, obliging,\r\nmodest, gentle, refined, cultivated\xe2\x80\x94_oh_, for shame! how can you say\r\nsuch things about him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t blame you, Sally\xe2\x80\x94indeed I haven\xe2\x80\x99t a word of blame for you for\r\nbeing blinded by\xe2\x80\x94your affection\xe2\x80\x94blinded to these minor defects which\r\nare so manifest to others who\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMinor defects? Do you call these minor defects? What are murder and\r\narson, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a difficult question to answer straight off\xe2\x80\x94and of course\r\nestimates of such things vary with environment. With us, out our way,\r\nthey would not necessarily attract as much attention as with you, yet\r\nthey are often regarded with disapproval\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMurder and arson are regarded with disapproval?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, frequently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith disapproval. Who _are_ those Puritans you are talking about? But\r\nwait\xe2\x80\x94how did you come to know so much about this family? Where did you\r\nget all this hearsay evidence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSally, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t hearsay evidence. That is the serious part of it. I\r\n_knew_ that family\xe2\x80\x94personally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou? You actually knew them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnew Zylo, as we used to call him, and knew his father, Dr. Snodgrass.\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know your own Snodgrass, but have had glimpses of him from\r\ntime to time, and I heard about him all the time. He was the common\r\ntalk, you see, on account of his\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn account of his not being a house-burner or an assassin, I suppose.\r\nThat would have made him commonplace. Where did you know these people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Cherokee Strip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how preposterous! There are not enough people in Cherokee Strip to\r\n_give_ anybody a reputation, good or bad. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a quorum. Why the\r\nwhole population consists of a couple of wagon loads of horse thieves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHawkins answered placidly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur friend was one of those wagon loads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSally\xe2\x80\x99s eyes burned and her breath came quick and fast, but she kept a\r\nfairly good grip on her anger and did not let it get the advantage of\r\nher tongue. The statesman sat still and waited for developments. He was\r\ncontent with his work. It was as handsome a piece of diplomatic art as\r\nhe had ever turned out, he thought; and now, let the girl make her own\r\nchoice. He judged she would let her spectre go; he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a doubt of it\r\nin fact; but anyway, let the choice be made, and he was ready to ratify\r\nit and offer no further hindrance.\r\n\r\nMeantime Sally had thought her case out and made up her mind. To the\r\nmajor\xe2\x80\x99s disappointment the verdict was against him. Sally said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has no friend but me, and I will not desert him now. I will not\r\nmarry him if his moral character is bad; but if he can prove that it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t, I will\xe2\x80\x94and he shall have the chance. To me he seems utterly good\r\nand dear; I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen anything about him that looked\r\notherwise\xe2\x80\x94except, of course, his calling himself an earl\xe2\x80\x99s son. Maybe\r\nthat is only vanity, and no real harm, when you get to the bottom of\r\nit. I do _not_ believe he is any such person as you have painted him. I\r\nwant to see him. I want you to find him and send him to me. I will\r\nimplore him to be honest with me, and tell me the whole truth, and not\r\nbe afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; if that is your decision I will do it. But Sally, you know,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s poor, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t care anything about that. That\xe2\x80\x99s neither here nor there.\r\nWill you bring him to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do it. When?\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear, it\xe2\x80\x99s getting toward dark, now, and so you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to put it\r\noff till morning. But you _will_ find him in the morning, _won\xe2\x80\x99t_ you?\r\nPromise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have him here by daylight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _now_ you\xe2\x80\x99re your own old self again\xe2\x80\x94and lovelier than ever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask fairer than that. Good-bye, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSally mused a moment alone, then said earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cI love him in _spite_\r\nof his name!\xe2\x80\x9d and went about her affairs with a light heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nHawkins went straight to the telegraph office and disburdened his\r\nconscience. He said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not going to give this\r\ngalvanized cadaver up, that\xe2\x80\x99s plain. Wild horses can\xe2\x80\x99t pull her away\r\nfrom him. I\xe2\x80\x99ve done my share; it\xe2\x80\x99s for Sellers to take an innings,\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d So he sent this message to New York:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Come back. Hire special train. She\xe2\x80\x99s going to marry the\r\nmaterializee_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeantime a note came to Rossmore Towers to say that the Earl of\r\nRossmore had just arrived from England, and would do himself the\r\npleasure of calling in the evening. Sally said to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a\r\npity he didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop in New York; but it\xe2\x80\x99s no matter; he can go up\r\nto-morrow and see my father. He has come over here to tomahawk papa,\r\nvery likely\xe2\x80\x94or buy out his claim. This thing would have excited me, a\r\nwhile back; but it has only one interest for me now, and only one\r\nvalue. I can say to\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94Spine, Spiny, Spinal\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t like any _form_ of\r\nthat name!\xe2\x80\x94I can say to him to-morrow, \xe2\x80\x98_Don\xe2\x80\x99t_ try to keep it up any\r\nmore, or I shall have to tell you whom I have been talking with last\r\nnight, and then you will be embarrassed.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t know he was to be invited for the morrow, or he might\r\nhave waited. As it was, he was too miserable to wait any longer; for\r\nhis last hope\xe2\x80\x94a letter\xe2\x80\x94had failed him. It was fully due to-day; it had\r\nnot come. Had his father really flung him away? It looked so. It was\r\nnot like his father, but it surely looked so. His father was a rather\r\ntough nut, in truth, but had never been so with his son\xe2\x80\x94still, this\r\nimplacable silence had a calamitous look. Anyway, Tracy would go to the\r\nTowers and \xe2\x80\x94then what? He didn\xe2\x80\x99t know; his head was tired out with\r\nthinking\xe2\x80\x94he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think about what he must do or say\xe2\x80\x94let it all take\r\ncare of itself. So that he saw Sally once more, he would be satisfied,\r\nhappen what might; he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care.\r\n\r\nHe hardly knew how he got to the Towers, or when. He knew and cared for\r\nonly one thing\xe2\x80\x94he was alone with Sally. She was kind, she was gentle,\r\nthere was moisture in her eyes, and a yearning something in her face\r\nand manner which she could not wholly hide\xe2\x80\x94but she kept her distance.\r\nThey talked. Bye and bye she said\xe2\x80\x94watching his downcast countenance out\r\nof the corner of her eye\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so lonesome\xe2\x80\x94with papa and mamma gone. I try to read, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseem to get interested in any book. I try the newspapers, but they do\r\nput such rubbish in them. You take up a paper and start to read\r\nsomething you thinks interesting, and it goes on and on and on about\r\nhow somebody\xe2\x80\x94well, Dr. Snodgrass, for instance\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot a movement from Tracy, not the quiver of a muscle. Sally was amazed\r\n\xe2\x80\x94what command of himself he must have! Being disconcerted, she paused\r\nso long that Tracy presently looked up wearily and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I thought you were not listening. Yes, it goes on and on about\r\nthis Doctor Snodgrass, till you are so tired, and then about his\r\nyounger son\xe2\x80\x94_the favorite son_\xe2\x80\x94Zylobalsamum Snodgrass\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot a sign from Tracy, whose head was drooping again. What supernatural\r\nself-possession! Sally fixed her eye on him and began again, resolved\r\nto blast him out of his serenity this time if she knew how to apply the\r\ndynamite that is concealed in certain forms of words when those words\r\nare properly loaded with unexpected meanings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd next it goes on and on and on about the eldest son\xe2\x80\x94_not_ the\r\nfavorite, this one\xe2\x80\x94and how he is neglected in his poor barren boyhood,\r\nand allowed to grow up unschooled, ignorant, coarse, vulgar, the\r\ncomrade of the community\xe2\x80\x99s scum, and become in his completed manhood a\r\nrude, profane, dissipated ruffian\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat head still drooped! Sally rose, moved softly and solemnly a step\r\nor two, and stood before Tracy\xe2\x80\x94his head came slowly up, his meek eyes\r\nmet her intense ones\xe2\x80\x94then she finished with deep impressiveness\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94named Spinal Meningitis Snodgrass!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTracy merely exhibited signs of increased fatigue. The girl was\r\noutraged by this iron indifference and callousness, and cried out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _are_ you made of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you _any_ sensitiveness? Don\xe2\x80\x99t these things touch any poor\r\n_remnant_ of delicate feeling in you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cN\xe2\x80\x94no,\xe2\x80\x9d he said wonderingly, \xe2\x80\x9cthey don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to. Why should they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, dear me, _how_ can you look so innocent, and foolish, and good, and\r\nempty, and gentle, and all that, right in the hearing of such things as\r\nthose! Look me in the eye\xe2\x80\x94straight in the eye. There, now then, answer\r\nme without a flinch. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t Doctor Snodgrass your father, and isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nZylobalsamum your brother,\xe2\x80\x9d [here Hawkins was about to enter the room,\r\nbut changed his mind upon hearing these words, and elected for a walk\r\ndown town, and so glided swiftly away], \xe2\x80\x9cand isn\xe2\x80\x99t your name Spinal\r\nMeningitis, and isn\xe2\x80\x99t your father a doctor and an idiot, like all the\r\nfamily for generations, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he name all his children after\r\npoisons and pestilences and abnormal anatomical eccentricities of the\r\nhuman body? Answer me, some way or somehow\xe2\x80\x94and quick. _Why_ do you sit\r\nthere looking like an envelope without any address on it and see me\r\ngoing mad before your face with suspense!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I wish I could do\xe2\x80\x94do\xe2\x80\x94I wish I could do something, _anything_ that\r\nwould give you peace again and make you happy; but I know of nothing\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nknow of no way. I have never heard of these awful people before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Say it again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never\xe2\x80\x94never in my life till now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you _do_ look so honest when you say that! It _must_ be\r\ntrue\xe2\x80\x94surely you _couldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ look that way, you _wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ look that way\r\nif it were not true\xe2\x80\x94_would_ you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. It _is_ true. Oh, let us end this\r\nsuffering\xe2\x80\x94take me back into your heart and confidence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait\xe2\x80\x94one more thing. Tell me you told that falsehood out of mere\r\nvanity and are sorry for it; that you\xe2\x80\x99re _not_ expecting to ever wear\r\nthe coronet of an earl\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly I am cured\xe2\x80\x94cured this very day\xe2\x80\x94I am not expecting it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, now you _are_ mine! I\xe2\x80\x99ve got you back in the beauty and glory of\r\nyour unsmirched poverty and your honorable obscurity, and nobody shall\r\never take you from me again but the grave! And if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDe earl of Rossmore, fum Englan\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father!\xe2\x80\x9d The young man released the girl and hung his head.\r\n\r\n\r\np266.jpg (21K)\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman stood surveying the couple\xe2\x80\x94the one with a strongly\r\ncomplimentary right eye, the other with a mixed expression done with\r\nthe left. This is difficult, and not often resorted to. Presently his\r\nface relaxed into a kind of constructive gentleness, and he said to his\r\nson:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think you could embrace me, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man did it with alacrity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you _are_ the son of an earl, after all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sally,\r\nreproachfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I won\xe2\x80\x99t have you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, but you know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I will not. You\xe2\x80\x99ve told me another fib.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s right. Go away and leave us. I want to talk with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBerkeley was obliged to go. But he did not go far. He remained on the\r\npremises. At midnight the conference between the old gentleman and the\r\nyoung girl was still going blithely on, but it presently drew to a\r\nclose, and the former said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came all the way over here to inspect you, my dear, with the general\r\nidea of breaking off this match if there were _two_ fools of you, but\r\nas there\xe2\x80\x99s only one, you can have him if you\xe2\x80\x99ll take him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I will, then! May I kiss you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may. Thank you. Now you shall have that privilege whenever you are\r\ngood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeantime Hawkins had long ago returned and slipped up into the\r\nlaboratory. He was rather disconcerted to find his late invention,\r\nSnodgrass, there. The news was told him that the English Rossmore was\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m his son, Viscount Berkeley, not Howard Tracy any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHawkins was aghast. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood gracious, then you\xe2\x80\x99re dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes you are\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ve got your ashes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang those ashes, I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of them; I\xe2\x80\x99ll give them to my father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSlowly and painfully the statesman worked the truth into his head that\r\nthis was really a flesh and blood young man, and not the insubstantial\r\nresurrection he and Sellers had so long supposed him to be. Then he\r\nsaid with feeling\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so glad; so glad on Sally\xe2\x80\x99s account, poor thing. We took you for a\r\ndeparted materialized bank thief from Tahlequah. This will be a heavy\r\nblow to Sellers.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he explained the whole matter to Berkeley, who\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the Claimant must manage to stand the blow, severe as it is. But\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll get over the disappointment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x94the colonel? He\xe2\x80\x99ll get over it the minute he invents a new miracle\r\nto take its place. And he\xe2\x80\x99s already at it by this time. But look\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x94what do you suppose became of the man you\xe2\x80\x99ve been _representing_\r\nall this time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I saved his clothes\xe2\x80\x94it was all I could do. I am afraid\r\nhe lost his life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you must have found twenty or thirty thousand dollars in those\r\nclothes, in money or certificates of deposit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I found only five hundred and a trifle. I borrowed the trifle and\r\nbanked the five hundred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll we do about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReturn it to the owner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s easy said, but not easy to manage. Let\xe2\x80\x99s leave it alone till we\r\nget Sellers\xe2\x80\x99s advice. And that reminds me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to run and meet\r\nSellers and explain who you are _not_ and who you _are_, or he\xe2\x80\x99ll come\r\nthundering in here to stop his daughter from marrying a phantom.\r\nBut\xe2\x80\x94suppose your father came over here to break off the match?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he down stairs getting acquainted with Sally? That\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nsafe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Hawkins departed to meet and prepare the Sellerses.\r\n\r\nRossmore Towers saw great times and late hours during the succeeding\r\nweek. The two earls were such opposites in nature that they fraternized\r\nat once. Sellers said privately that Rossmore was the most\r\nextraordinary character he had ever met\xe2\x80\x94a man just made out of the\r\ncondensed milk of human kindness, yet with the ability to totally hide\r\nthe fact from any but the most practised character-reader; a man whose\r\nwhole being was sweetness, patience and charity, yet with a cunning so\r\nprofound, an ability so marvelous in the acting of a double part, that\r\nmany a person of considerable intelligence might live with him for\r\ncenturies and never suspect the presence in him of these\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\nFinally there was a quiet wedding at the Towers, instead of a big one\r\nat the British embassy, with the militia and the fire brigades and the\r\ntemperance organizations on hand in torchlight procession, as at first\r\nproposed by one of the earls. The art-firm and Barrow were present at\r\nthe wedding, and the tinner and Puss had been invited, but the tinner\r\nwas ill and Puss was nursing him\xe2\x80\x94for they were engaged.\r\n\r\n\r\np270.jpg (39K)\r\n\r\nThe Sellerses were to go to England with their new allies for a brief\r\nvisit, but when it was time to take the train from Washington, the\r\ncolonel was missing.\r\n\r\nHawkins was going as far as New York with the party, and said he would\r\nexplain the matter on the road.\r\n\r\nThe explanation was in a letter left by the colonel in Hawkins\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\r\nIn it he promised to join Mrs. Sellers later, in England, and then went\r\non to say:\r\n\r\nThe truth is, my dear Hawkins, a mighty idea has been born to me within\r\nthe hour, and I must not even stop to say goodbye to my dear ones. A\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s highest duty takes precedence of all minor ones, and must be\r\nattended to with his best promptness and energy, at whatsoever cost to\r\nhis affections or his convenience. And first of all a man\xe2\x80\x99s duties is\r\nhis duty to his own honor\xe2\x80\x94he must keep that spotless. Mine is\r\nthreatened. When I was feeling sure of my imminent future solidity, I\r\nforwarded to the Czar of Russia\xe2\x80\x94perhaps prematurely\xe2\x80\x94an offer for the\r\npurchase of Siberia, naming a vast sum. Since then an episode has\r\nwarned me that the method by which I was expecting to acquire this\r\nmoney\xe2\x80\x94materialization upon a scale of limitless magnitude\xe2\x80\x94is marred by\r\na taint of temporary uncertainty. His imperial majesty may accept my\r\noffer at any moment. If this should occur now, I should find myself\r\npainfully embarrassed, in fact financially inadequate. I could not take\r\nSiberia. This would become known, and my credit would suffer.\r\n\r\nRecently my private hours have been dark indeed, but the sun shines\r\nagain now; I see my way; I shall be able to meet my obligation, and\r\nwithout having to ask an extension of the stipulated time, I think.\r\nThis grand new idea of mine\xe2\x80\x94the sublimest I have ever conceived, will\r\nsave me whole, I am sure. I am leaving for San Francisco this moment,\r\nto test it, by the help of the great Lick telescope. Like all of my\r\nmore notable discoveries and inventions, it is based upon hard,\r\npractical scientific laws; all other bases are unsound and hence\r\nuntrustworthy.\r\n\r\nIn brief, then, I have conceived the stupendous idea of reorganizing\r\nthe climates of the earth according to the desire of the populations\r\ninterested. That is to say, I will furnish climates to order, for cash\r\nor negotiable paper, taking the old climates in part payment, of\r\ncourse, at a fair discount, where they are in condition to be repaired\r\nat small cost and let out for hire to poor and remote communities not\r\nable to afford a good climate and not caring for an expensive one for\r\nmere display. My studies have convinced me that the regulation of\r\nclimates and the breeding of new varieties at will from the old stock\r\nis a feasible thing. Indeed I am convinced that it has been done\r\nbefore; done in prehistoric times by now forgotten and unrecorded\r\ncivilizations. Everywhere I find hoary evidences of artificial\r\nmanipulation of climates in bygone times. Take the glacial period. Was\r\nthat produced by accident? Not at all; it was done for money. I have a\r\nthousand proofs of it, and will some day reveal them.\r\n\r\nI will confide to you an outline of my idea. It is to utilize the spots\r\non the sun\xe2\x80\x94get control of them, you understand, and apply the\r\nstupendous energies which they wield to beneficent purposes in the\r\nreorganizing of our climates. At present they merely make trouble and\r\ndo harm in the evoking of cyclones and other kinds of electric storms;\r\nbut once under humane and intelligent control this will cease and they\r\nwill become a boon to man.\r\n\r\nI have my plan all mapped out, whereby I hope and expect to acquire\r\ncomplete and perfect control of the sun-spots, also details of the\r\nmethod whereby I shall employ the same commercially; but I will not\r\nventure to go into particulars before the patents shall have been\r\nissued. I shall hope and expect to sell shop-rights to the minor\r\ncountries at a reasonable figure and supply a good business article of\r\nclimate to the great empires at special rates, together with fancy\r\nbrands for coronations, battles and other great and particular\r\noccasions. There are billions of money in this enterprise, no expensive\r\nplant is required, and I shall begin to realize in a few days\xe2\x80\x94in a few\r\nweeks at furthest. I shall stand ready to pay cash for Siberia the\r\nmoment it is delivered, and thus save my honor and my credit. I am\r\nconfident of this.\r\n\r\nI would like you to provide a proper outfit and start north as soon as\r\nI telegraph you, be it night or be it day. I wish you to take up all\r\nthe country stretching away from the north pole on all sides for many\r\ndegrees south, and buy Greenland and Iceland at the best figure you can\r\nget now while they are cheap. It is my intention to move one of the\r\ntropics up there and transfer the frigid zone to the equator. I will\r\nhave the entire Arctic Circle in the market as a summer resort next\r\nyear, and will use the surplusage of the old climate, over and above\r\nwhat can be utilized on the equator, to reduce the temperature of\r\nopposition resorts. But I have said enough to give you an idea of the\r\nprodigious nature of my scheme and the feasible and enormously\r\nprofitable character of it. I shall join all you happy people in\r\nEngland as soon as I shall have sold out some of my principal climates\r\nand arranged with the Czar about Siberia.\r\n\r\nMeantime, watch for a sign from me. Eight days from now, we shall be\r\nwide asunder; for I shall be on the border of the Pacific, and you far\r\nout on the Atlantic, approaching England. That day, if I am alive and\r\nmy sublime discovery is proved and established, I will send you\r\ngreeting, and my messenger shall deliver it where you are, in the\r\nsolitudes of the sea; for I will waft a vast sun-spot across the disk\r\nlike drifting smoke, and you will know it for my love-sign, and will\r\nsay \xe2\x80\x9cMulberry Sellers throws us a kiss across the universe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nWEATHER FOR USE IN THIS BOOK.\r\n\r\n_Selected from the Best Authorities._\r\n\r\n\r\nA brief though violent thunderstorm which had raged over the city was\r\npassing away; but still, though the rain had ceased more than an hour\r\nbefore, wild piles of dark and coppery clouds, in which a fierce and\r\nrayless glow was laboring, gigantically overhung the grotesque and\r\nhuddled vista of dwarf houses, while in the distance, sheeting high\r\nover the low, misty confusion of gables and chimneys, spread a pall of\r\ndead, leprous blue, suffused with blotches of dull, glistening yellow,\r\nand with black plague-spots of vapor floating and faint lightnings\r\ncrinkling on its surface. Thunder, still muttering in the close and\r\nsultry air, kept the scared dwellers in the street within, behind their\r\nclosed shutters; and all deserted, cowed, dejected, squalid, like poor,\r\nstupid, top-heavy things that had felt the wrath of the summer tempest,\r\nstood the drenched structures on either side of the narrow and crooked\r\nway, ghastly and picturesque, under the giant canopy. Rain dripped\r\nwretchedly in slow drops of melancholy sound from their projecting\r\neaves upon the broken flagging, lay there in pools or trickled into the\r\nswollen drains, where the fallen torrent sullenly gurgled on its way to\r\nthe river. \xe2\x80\x9c_The Brazen Android._\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_W.

The hot wind had become wild and rampant. It was whipping\r\nup the sandy coating of the plain in every direction. High in the air\r\nwere seen whirling spires and cones of sand\xe2\x80\x94a curious effect against\r\nthe deep-blue sky. Below, puffs of sand were breaking out of the plain\r\nin every direction, as though the plain were alive with invisible\r\nhorsemen. These sandy cloudlets were instantly dissipated by the wind;\r\nit was the larger clouds that were lifted whole into the air, and the\r\nlarger clouds of sand were becoming more and more the rule.\r\n\r\nAlfred\xe2\x80\x99s eye, quickly scanning the horizon, descried the roof of the\r\nboundary-rider\xe2\x80\x99s hut still gleaming in the sunlight. He remembered the\r\nhut well. It could not be farther than four miles, if as much as that,\r\nfrom this point of the track. He also knew these dust-storms of old;\r\nBindarra was notorious for them: Without thinking twice, Alfred put\r\nspurs to his horse and headed for the hut. Before he had ridden half\r\nthe distance the detached clouds of sand banded together in one dense\r\nwhirlwind, and it was only owing to his horse\xe2\x80\x99s instinct that he did\r\nnot ride wide of the hut altogether; for during the last half-mile he\r\nnever saw the hut, until its outline loomed suddenly over his horse\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nears; and by then the sun was invisible.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_A Bride from the Bush_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt rained forty days and forty nights.\xe2\x80\x94_Genesis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE AMERICAN CLAIMANT ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
