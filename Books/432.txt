The situation\r\ninvolved is gathered up betimes, that is in the second chapter of Book\r\nFifth, for the reader\xe2\x80\x99s benefit, into as few words as possible\xe2\x80\x94planted\r\nor \xe2\x80\x9csunk,\xe2\x80\x9d stiffly and saliently, in the centre of the current, almost\r\nperhaps to the obstruction of traffic. Never can a composition of this\r\nsort have sprung straighter from a dropped grain of suggestion, and\r\nnever can that grain, developed, overgrown and smothered, have yet\r\nlurked more in the mass as an independent particle. The whole case, in\r\nfine, is in Lambert Strether\xe2\x80\x99s irrepressible outbreak to little Bilham\r\non the Sunday afternoon in Gloriani\xe2\x80\x99s garden, the candour with which he\r\nyields, for his young friend\xe2\x80\x99s enlightenment, to the charming\r\nadmonition of that crisis. The idea of the tale resides indeed in the\r\nvery fact that an hour of such unprecedented ease should have been felt\r\nby him _as_ a crisis, and he is at pains to express it for us as neatly\r\nas we could desire. The remarks to which he thus gives utterance\r\ncontain the essence of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ambassadors,\xe2\x80\x9d his fingers close, before he\r\nhas done, round the stem of the full-blown flower; which, after that\r\nfashion, he continues officiously to present to us. \xe2\x80\x9cLive all you can;\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake not to. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t so much matter what you do in\r\nparticular so long as you have your life. If you haven\xe2\x80\x99t had that what\r\n_have_ you had? I\xe2\x80\x99m too old\xe2\x80\x94too old at any rate for what I see. What\r\none loses one loses; make no mistake about that. Still, we have the\r\nillusion of freedom; therefore don\xe2\x80\x99t, like me to-day, be without the\r\nmemory of that illusion. I was either, at the right time, too stupid or\r\ntoo intelligent to have it, and now I\xe2\x80\x99m a case of reaction against the\r\nmistake. Do what you like so long as you don\xe2\x80\x99t make it. For it _was_ a\r\nmistake. Live, live!\xe2\x80\x9d Such is the gist of Strether\xe2\x80\x99s appeal to the\r\nimpressed youth, whom he likes and whom he desires to befriend; the\r\nword \xe2\x80\x9cmistake\xe2\x80\x9d occurs several times, it will be seen, in the course of\r\nhis remarks\xe2\x80\x94which gives the measure of the signal warning he feels\r\nattached to his case. He has accordingly missed too much, though\r\nperhaps after all constitutionally qualified for a better part, and he\r\nwakes up to it in conditions that press the spring of a terrible\r\nquestion. _Would_ there yet perhaps be time for reparation?\xe2\x80\x94reparation,\r\nthat is, for the injury done his character; for the affront, he is\r\nquite ready to say, so stupidly put upon it and in which he has even\r\nhimself had so clumsy a hand? The answer to which is that he now at all\r\nevents _sees_; so that the business of my tale and the march of my\r\naction, not to say the precious moral of everything, is just my\r\ndemonstration of this process of vision.\r\n\r\nNothing can exceed the closeness with which the whole fits again into\r\nits germ. That had been given me bodily, as usual, by the spoken word,\r\nfor I was to take the image over exactly as I happened to have met it.\r\nA friend had repeated to me, with great appreciation, a thing or two\r\nsaid to him by a man of distinction, much his senior, and to which a\r\nsense akin to that of Strether\xe2\x80\x99s melancholy eloquence might be\r\nimputed\xe2\x80\x94said as chance would have, and so easily might, in Paris, and\r\nin a charming old garden attached to a house of art, and on a Sunday\r\nafternoon of summer, many persons of great interest being present. The\r\nobservation there listened to and gathered up had contained part of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnote\xe2\x80\x9d that I was to recognise on the spot as to my purpose\xe2\x80\x94had\r\ncontained in fact the greater part; the rest was in the place and the\r\ntime and the scene they sketched: these constituents clustered and\r\ncombined to give me further support, to give me what I may call the\r\nnote absolute. There it stands, accordingly, full in the tideway;\r\ndriven in, with hard taps, like some strong stake for the noose of a\r\ncable, the swirl of the current roundabout it. What amplified the hint\r\nto more than the bulk of hints in general was the gift with it of the\r\nold Paris garden, for in that token were sealed up values infinitely\r\nprecious. There was of course the seal to break and each item of the\r\npacket to count over and handle and estimate; but somehow, in the light\r\nof the hint, all the elements of a situation of the sort most to my\r\ntaste were there. I could even remember no occasion on which, so\r\nconfronted, I had found it of a livelier interest to take stock, in\r\nthis fashion, of suggested wealth. For I think, verily, that there are\r\ndegrees of merit in subjects\xe2\x80\x94in spite of the fact that to treat even\r\none of the most ambiguous with due decency we must for the time, for\r\nthe feverish and prejudiced hour, at least figure its merit and its\r\ndignity as _possibly_ absolute. What it comes to, doubtless, is that\r\neven among the supremely good\xe2\x80\x94since with such alone is it one\xe2\x80\x99s theory\r\nof one\xe2\x80\x99s honour to be concerned\xe2\x80\x94there is an ideal _beauty_ of goodness\r\nthe invoked action of which is to raise the artistic faith to its\r\nmaximum. Then truly, I hold, one\xe2\x80\x99s theme may be said to shine, and that\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ambassadors,\xe2\x80\x9d I confess, wore this glow for me from beginning\r\nto end. Fortunately thus I am able to estimate this as, frankly, quite\r\nthe best, \xe2\x80\x9call round,\xe2\x80\x9d of all my productions; any failure of that\r\njustification would have made such an extreme of complacency publicly\r\nfatuous.\r\n\r\nI recall then in this connexion no moment of subjective intermittence,\r\nnever one of those alarms as for a suspected hollow beneath one\xe2\x80\x99s feet,\r\na felt ingratitude in the scheme adopted, under which confidence fails\r\nand opportunity seems but to mock. If the motive of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wings of the\r\nDove,\xe2\x80\x9d as I have noted, was to worry me at moments by a sealing-up of\r\nits face\xe2\x80\x94though without prejudice to its again, of a sudden, fairly\r\ngrimacing with expression\xe2\x80\x94so in this other business I had absolute\r\nconviction and constant clearness to deal with; it had been a frank\r\nproposition, the whole bunch of data, installed on my premises like a\r\nmonotony of fine weather. (The order of composition, in these things, I\r\nmay mention, was reversed by the order of publication; the earlier\r\nwritten of the two books having appeared as the later.) Even under the\r\nweight of my hero\xe2\x80\x99s years I could feel my postulate firm; even under\r\nthe strain of the difference between those of Madame de Vionnet and\r\nthose of Chad Newsome, a difference liable to be denounced as shocking,\r\nI could still feel it serene. Nothing resisted, nothing betrayed, I\r\nseem to make out, in this full and sound sense of the matter; it shed\r\nfrom any side I could turn it to the same golden glow. I rejoiced in\r\nthe promise of a hero so mature, who would give me thereby the more to\r\nbite into\xe2\x80\x94since it\xe2\x80\x99s only into thickened motive and accumulated\r\ncharacter, I think, that the painter of life bites more than a little.\r\nMy poor friend should have accumulated character, certainly; or rather\r\nwould be quite naturally and handsomely possessed of it, in the sense\r\nthat he would have, and would always have felt he had, imagination\r\ngalore, and that this yet wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have wrecked him. It was\r\nimmeasurable, the opportunity to \xe2\x80\x9cdo\xe2\x80\x9d a man of imagination, for if\r\n_there_ mightn\xe2\x80\x99t be a chance to \xe2\x80\x9cbite,\xe2\x80\x9d where in the world might it be?\r\nThis personage of course, so enriched, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give me, for his type,\r\nimagination in _predominance_ or as his prime faculty, nor should I, in\r\nview of other matters, have found that convenient. So particular a\r\nluxury\xe2\x80\x94some occasion, that is, for study of the high gift in _supreme_\r\ncommand of a case or of a career\xe2\x80\x94would still doubtless come on the day\r\nI should be ready to pay for it; and till then might, as from far back,\r\nremain hung up well in view and just out of reach. The comparative case\r\nmeanwhile would serve\xe2\x80\x94it was only on the minor scale that I had treated\r\nmyself even to comparative cases.\r\n\r\nI was to hasten to add however that, happy stopgaps as the minor scale\r\nhad thus yielded, the instance in hand should enjoy the advantage of\r\nthe full range of the major; since most immediately to the point was\r\nthe question of that _supplement_ of situation logically involved in\r\nour gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s impulse to deliver himself in the Paris garden on the\r\nSunday afternoon\xe2\x80\x94or if not involved by strict logic then all ideally\r\nand enchantingly implied in it. (I say \xe2\x80\x9cideally,\xe2\x80\x9d because I need scarce\r\nmention that for development, for expression of its maximum, my\r\nglimmering story was, at the earliest stage, to have nipped the thread\r\nof connexion with the possibilities of the actual reported speaker.\r\n_He_ remains but the happiest of accidents; his actualities, all too\r\ndefinite, precluded any range of possibilities; it had only been his\r\ncharming office to project upon that wide field of the artist\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvision\xe2\x80\x94which hangs there ever in place like the white sheet suspended\r\nfor the figures of a child\xe2\x80\x99s magic-lantern\xe2\x80\x94a more fantastic and more\r\nmoveable shadow.) No privilege of the teller of tales and the handler\r\nof puppets is more delightful, or has more of the suspense and the\r\nthrill of a game of difficulty breathlessly played, than just this\r\nbusiness of looking for the unseen and the occult, in a scheme\r\nhalf-grasped, by the light or, so to speak, by the clinging scent, of\r\nthe gage already in hand. No dreadful old pursuit of the hidden slave\r\nwith bloodhounds and the rag of association can ever, for \xe2\x80\x9cexcitement,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI judge, have bettered it at its best. For the dramatist always, by the\r\nvery law of his genius, believes not only in a possible right issue\r\nfrom the rightly-conceived tight place; he does much more than this\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nbelieves, irresistibly, in the necessary, the precious \xe2\x80\x9ctightness\xe2\x80\x9d of\r\nthe place (whatever the issue) on the strength of any respectable hint.\r\nIt being thus the respectable hint that I had with such avidity picked\r\nup, what would be the story to which it would most inevitably form the\r\ncentre? It is part of the charm attendant on such questions that the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cstory,\xe2\x80\x9d with the omens true, as I say, puts on from this stage the\r\nauthenticity of concrete existence. It then is, essentially\xe2\x80\x94it begins\r\nto be, though it may more or less obscurely lurk, so that the point is\r\nnot in the least what to make of it, but only, very delightfully and\r\nvery damnably, where to put one\xe2\x80\x99s hand on it.\r\n\r\nIn which truth resides surely much of the interest of that admirable\r\nmixture for salutary application which we know as art. Art deals with\r\nwhat we see, it must first contribute full-handed that ingredient; it\r\nplucks its material, otherwise expressed, in the garden of life\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nmaterial elsewhere grown is stale and uneatable. But it has no sooner\r\ndone this than it has to take account of a _process_\xe2\x80\x94from which only\r\nwhen it\xe2\x80\x99s the basest of the servants of man, incurring ignominious\r\ndismissal with no \xe2\x80\x9ccharacter,\xe2\x80\x9d does it, and whether under some muddled\r\npretext of morality or on any other, pusillanimously edge away. The\r\nprocess, that of the expression, the literal squeezing-out, of value is\r\nanother affair\xe2\x80\x94with which the happy luck of mere finding has little to\r\ndo. The joys of finding, at this stage, are pretty well over; that\r\nquest of the subject as a whole by \xe2\x80\x9cmatching,\xe2\x80\x9d as the ladies say at the\r\nshops, the big piece with the snippet, having ended, we assume, with a\r\ncapture. The subject is found, and if the problem is then transferred\r\nto the ground of what to do with it the field opens out for any amount\r\nof doing. This is precisely the infusion that, as I submit, completes\r\nthe strong mixture. It is on the other hand the part of the business\r\nthat can least be likened to the chase with horn and hound. It\xe2\x80\x99s all a\r\nsedentary part\xe2\x80\x94involves as much ciphering, of sorts, as would merit the\r\nhighest salary paid to a chief accountant. Not, however, that the chief\r\naccountant hasn\xe2\x80\x99t _his_ gleams of bliss; for the felicity, or at least\r\nthe equilibrium of the artist\xe2\x80\x99s state dwells less, surely, in the\r\nfurther delightful complications he can smuggle in than in those he\r\nsucceeds in keeping out. He sows his seed at the risk of too thick a\r\ncrop; wherefore yet again, like the gentlemen who audit ledgers, he\r\nmust keep his head at any price. In consequence of all which, for the\r\ninterest of the matter, I might seem here to have my choice of\r\nnarrating my \xe2\x80\x9chunt\xe2\x80\x9d for Lambert Strether, of describing the capture of\r\nthe shadow projected by my friend\xe2\x80\x99s anecdote, or of reporting on the\r\noccurrences subsequent to that triumph. But I had probably best attempt\r\na little to glance in each direction; since it comes to me again and\r\nagain, over this licentious record, that one\xe2\x80\x99s bag of adventures,\r\nconceived or conceivable, has been only half-emptied by the mere\r\ntelling of one\xe2\x80\x99s story. It depends so on what one means by that\r\nequivocal quantity. There is the story of one\xe2\x80\x99s hero, and then, thanks\r\nto the intimate connexion of things, the story of one\xe2\x80\x99s story itself. I\r\nblush to confess it, but if one\xe2\x80\x99s a dramatist one\xe2\x80\x99s a dramatist, and\r\nthe latter imbroglio is liable on occasion to strike me as really the\r\nmore objective of the two.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy imputed to him in that beautiful outbreak, the hour\r\nthere, amid such happy provision, striking for him, would have been\r\nthen, on behalf of my man of imagination, to be logically and, as the\r\nartless craft of comedy has it, \xe2\x80\x9cled up\xe2\x80\x9d to; the probable course to\r\nsuch a goal, the goal of so conscious a predicament, would have in\r\nshort to be finely calculated. Where has he come from and why has he\r\ncome, what is he doing (as we Anglo-Saxons, and we only, say, in our\r\nforedoomed clutch of exotic aids to expression) in that _gal\xc3\xa8re?_ To\r\nanswer these questions plausibly, to answer them as under\r\ncross-examination in the witness-box by counsel for the prosecution, in\r\nother words satisfactorily to account for Strether and for his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpeculiar tone,\xe2\x80\x9d was to possess myself of the entire fabric. At the\r\nsame time the clue to its whereabouts would lie in a certain principle\r\nof probability: he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have indulged in his peculiar tone without\r\na reason; it would take a felt predicament or a false position to give\r\nhim so ironic an accent. One hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been noting \xe2\x80\x9ctones\xe2\x80\x9d all one\xe2\x80\x99s life\r\nwithout recognising when one heard it the voice of the false position.\r\nThe dear man in the Paris garden was then admirably and unmistakeably\r\n_in_ one\xe2\x80\x94which was no small point gained; what next accordingly\r\nconcerned us was the determination of _this_ identity. One could only\r\ngo by probabilities, but there was the advantage that the most general\r\nof the probabilities were virtual certainties. Possessed of our\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s nationality, to start with, there was a general probability in\r\nhis narrower localism; which, for that matter, one had really but to\r\nkeep under the lens for an hour to see it give up its secrets. He would\r\nhave issued, our rueful worthy, from the very heart of New England\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nthe heels of which matter of course a perfect train of secrets tumbled\r\nfor me into the light. They had to be sifted and sorted, and I shall\r\nnot reproduce the detail of that process; but unmistakeably they were\r\nall there, and it was but a question, auspiciously, of picking among\r\nthem. What the \xe2\x80\x9cposition\xe2\x80\x9d would infallibly be, and why, on his hands,\r\nit had turned \xe2\x80\x9cfalse\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94these inductive steps could only be as rapid as\r\nthey were distinct. I accounted for everything\xe2\x80\x94and \xe2\x80\x9ceverything\xe2\x80\x9d had by\r\nthis time become the most promising quantity\xe2\x80\x94by the view that he had\r\ncome to Paris in some state of mind which was literally undergoing, as\r\na result of new and unexpected assaults and infusions, a change almost\r\nfrom hour to hour. He had come with a view that might have been figured\r\nby a clear green liquid, say, in a neat glass phial; and the liquid,\r\nonce poured into the open cup of _application_, once exposed to the\r\naction of another air, had begun to turn from green to red, or\r\nwhatever, and might, for all he knew, be on its way to purple, to\r\nblack, to yellow. At the still wilder extremes represented perhaps, for\r\nall he could say to the contrary, by a variability so violent, he would\r\nat first, naturally, but have gazed in surprise and alarm; whereby the\r\n_situation_ clearly would spring from the play of wildness and the\r\ndevelopment of extremes. I saw in a moment that, should this\r\ndevelopment proceed both with force and logic, my \xe2\x80\x9cstory\xe2\x80\x9d would leave\r\nnothing to be desired. There is always, of course, for the\r\nstory-teller, the irresistible determinant and the incalculable\r\nadvantage of his interest in the story _as such_; it is ever,\r\nobviously, overwhelmingly, the prime and precious thing (as other than\r\nthis I have never been able to see it); as to which what makes for it,\r\nwith whatever headlong energy, may be said to pale before the energy\r\nwith which it simply makes for itself. It rejoices, none the less, at\r\nits best, to seem to offer itself in a light, to seem to know, and with\r\nthe very last knowledge, what it\xe2\x80\x99s about\xe2\x80\x94liable as it yet is at moments\r\nto be caught by us with its tongue in its cheek and absolutely no\r\nwarrant but its splendid impudence. Let us grant then that the\r\nimpudence is always there\xe2\x80\x94there, so to speak, for grace and effect and\r\n_allure_; there, above all, because the Story is just the spoiled child\r\nof art, and because, as we are always disappointed when the pampered\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cplay up,\xe2\x80\x9d we like it, to that extent, to look all its character.\r\nIt probably does so, in truth, even when we most flatter ourselves that\r\nwe negotiate with it by treaty.\r\n\r\nAll of which, again, is but to say that the _steps_, for my fable,\r\nplaced themselves with a prompt and, as it were, functional\r\nassurance\xe2\x80\x94an air quite as of readiness to have dispensed with logic had\r\nI been in fact too stupid for my clue. Never, positively, none the\r\nless, as the links multiplied, had I felt less stupid than for the\r\ndetermination of poor Strether\xe2\x80\x99s errand and for the apprehension of his\r\nissue. These things continued to fall together, as by the neat action\r\nof their own weight and form, even while their commentator scratched\r\nhis head about them; he easily sees now that they were always well in\r\nadvance of him. As the case completed itself he had in fact, from a\r\ngood way behind, to catch up with them, breathless and a little\r\nflurried, as he best could. _The_ false position, for our belated man\r\nof the world\xe2\x80\x94belated because he had endeavoured so long to escape being\r\none, and now at last had really to face his doom\xe2\x80\x94the false position for\r\nhim, I say, was obviously to have presented himself at the gate of that\r\nboundless menagerie primed with a moral scheme of the most approved\r\npattern which was yet framed to break down on any approach to vivid\r\nfacts; that is to any at all liberal appreciation of them. There would\r\nhave been of course the case of the Strether prepared, wherever\r\npresenting himself, only to judge and to feel meanly; but _he_ would\r\nhave moved for me, I confess, enveloped in no legend whatever. The\r\nactual man\xe2\x80\x99s note, from the first of our seeing it struck, is the note\r\nof discrimination, just as his drama is to become, under stress, the\r\ndrama of discrimination. It would have been his blest imagination, we\r\nhave seen, that had already helped him to discriminate; the element\r\nthat was for so much of the pleasure of my cutting thick, as I have\r\nintimated, into his intellectual, into his moral substance. Yet here it\r\nwas, at the same time, just here, that a shade for a moment fell across\r\nthe scene.\r\n\r\nThere was the dreadful little old tradition, one of the platitudes of\r\nthe human comedy, that people\xe2\x80\x99s moral scheme _does_ break down in\r\nParis; that nothing is more frequently observed; that hundreds of\r\nthousands of more or less hypocritical or more or less cynical persons\r\nannually visit the place for the sake of the probable catastrophe, and\r\nthat I came late in the day to work myself up about it. There was in\r\nfine the _trivial_ association, one of the vulgarest in the world; but\r\nwhich give me pause no longer, I think, simply because its vulgarity is\r\nso advertised. The revolution performed by Strether under the influence\r\nof the most interesting of great cities was to have nothing to do with\r\nany _b\xc3\xaatise_ of the imputably \xe2\x80\x9ctempted\xe2\x80\x9d state; he was to be thrown\r\nforward, rather, thrown quite with violence, upon his lifelong trick of\r\nintense reflexion: which friendly test indeed was to bring him out,\r\nthrough winding passages, through alternations of darkness and light,\r\nvery much _in_ Paris, but with the surrounding scene itself a minor\r\nmatter, a mere symbol for more things than had been dreamt of in the\r\nphilosophy of Woollett. Another surrounding scene would have done as\r\nwell for our show could it have represented a place in which Strether\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nerrand was likely to lie and his crisis to await him. The _likely_\r\nplace had the great merit of sparing me preparations; there would have\r\nbeen too many involved\xe2\x80\x94not at all impossibilities, only rather worrying\r\nand delaying difficulties\xe2\x80\x94in positing elsewhere Chad Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninteresting relation, his so interesting complexity of relations.\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s appointed stage, in fine, could be but Chad\xe2\x80\x99s most luckily\r\nselected one. The young man had gone in, as they say, for circumjacent\r\ncharm; and where he would have found it, by the turn of his mind, most\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cauthentic,\xe2\x80\x9d was where his earnest friend\xe2\x80\x99s analysis would most find\r\n_him_; as well as where, for that matter, the former\xe2\x80\x99s whole analytic\r\nfaculty would be led such a wonderful dance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Ambassadors\xe2\x80\x9d had been, all conveniently, \xe2\x80\x9carranged for\xe2\x80\x9d; its first\r\nappearance was from month to month, in the _North American Review_\r\nduring 1903, and I had been open from far back to any pleasant\r\nprovocation for ingenuity that might reside in one\xe2\x80\x99s actively\r\nadopting\xe2\x80\x94so as to make it, in its way, a small compositional\r\nlaw\xe2\x80\x94recurrent breaks and resumptions. I had made up my mind here\r\nregularly to exploit and enjoy these often rather rude jolts\xe2\x80\x94having\r\nfound, as I believed an admirable way to it; yet every question of form\r\nand pressure, I easily remember, paled in the light of the major\r\npropriety, recognised as soon as really weighed; that of employing but\r\none centre and keeping it all within my hero\xe2\x80\x99s compass. The thing was\r\nto be so much this worthy\xe2\x80\x99s intimate adventure that even the projection\r\nof his consciousness upon it from beginning to end without intermission\r\nor deviation would probably still leave a part of its value for him,\r\nand _a fortiori_ for ourselves, unexpressed. I might, however, express\r\nevery grain of it that there would be room for\xe2\x80\x94on condition of\r\ncontriving a splendid particular economy. Other persons in no small\r\nnumber were to people the scene, and each with his or her axe to grind,\r\nhis or her situation to treat, his or her coherency not to fail of, his\r\nor her relation to my leading motive, in a word, to establish and carry\r\non. But Strether\xe2\x80\x99s sense of these things, and Strether\xe2\x80\x99s only, should\r\navail me for showing them; I should know them but through his more or\r\nless groping knowledge of them, since his very gropings would figure\r\namong his most interesting motions, and a full observance of the rich\r\nrigour I speak of would give me more of the effect I should be most\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cafter\xe2\x80\x9d than all other possible observances together. It would give me\r\na large unity, and that in turn would crown me with the grace to which\r\nthe enlightened story-teller will at any time, for his interest,\r\nsacrifice if need be all other graces whatever. I refer of course to\r\nthe grace of intensity, which there are ways of signally achieving and\r\nways of signally missing\xe2\x80\x94as we see it, all round us, helplessly and\r\nwoefully missed. Not that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t, on the other hand, a virtue\r\neminently subject to appreciation\xe2\x80\x94there being no strict, no absolute\r\nmeasure of it; so that one may hear it acclaimed where it has quite\r\nescaped one\xe2\x80\x99s perception, and see it unnoticed where one has gratefully\r\nhailed it. After all of which I am not sure, either, that the immense\r\namusement of the whole cluster of difficulties so arrayed may not\r\noperate, for the fond fabulist, when judicious not less than fond, as\r\nhis best of determinants. That charming principle is always there, at\r\nall events, to keep interest fresh: it is a principle, we remember,\r\nessentially ravenous, without scruple and without mercy, appeased with\r\nno cheap nor easy nourishment. It enjoys the costly sacrifice and\r\nrejoices thereby in the very odour of difficulty\xe2\x80\x94even as ogres, with\r\ntheir \xe2\x80\x9cFee-faw-fum!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoice in the smell of the blood of Englishmen.\r\n\r\nThus it was, at all events, that the ultimate, though after all so\r\nspeedy, definition of my gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s job\xe2\x80\x94his coming out, all solemnly\r\nappointed and deputed, to \xe2\x80\x9csave\xe2\x80\x9d Chad, and his then finding the young\r\nman so disobligingly and, at first, so bewilderingly not lost that a\r\nnew issue altogether, in the connexion, prodigiously faces them, which\r\nhas to be dealt with in a new light\xe2\x80\x94promised as many calls on ingenuity\r\nand on the higher branches of the compositional art as one could\r\npossibly desire. Again and yet again, as, from book to book, I proceed\r\nwith my survey, I find no source of interest equal to this verification\r\nafter the fact, as I may call it, and the more in detail the better, of\r\nthe scheme of consistency \xe2\x80\x9cgone in\xe2\x80\x9d for. As always\xe2\x80\x94since the charm\r\nnever fails\xe2\x80\x94the retracing of the process from point to point brings\r\nback the old illusion. The old intentions bloom again and flower\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nspite of all the blossoms they were to have dropped by the way. This is\r\nthe charm, as I say, of adventure _transposed_\xe2\x80\x94the thrilling ups and\r\ndowns, the intricate ins and outs of the compositional problem, made\r\nafter such a fashion admirably objective, becoming the question at\r\nissue and keeping the author\xe2\x80\x99s heart in his mouth. Such an element, for\r\ninstance, as his intention that Mrs. Newsome, away off with her finger\r\non the pulse of Massachusetts, should yet be no less intensely than\r\ncircuitously present through the whole thing, should be no less felt as\r\nto be reckoned with than the most direct exhibition, the finest\r\nportrayal at first hand could make her, such a sign of artistic good\r\nfaith, I say, once it\xe2\x80\x99s unmistakeably there, takes on again an\r\nactuality not too much impaired by the comparative dimness of the\r\nparticular success. Cherished intention too inevitably acts and\r\noperates, in the book, about fifty times as little as I had fondly\r\ndreamt it might; but that scarce spoils for me the pleasure of\r\nrecognising the fifty ways in which I had sought to provide for it. The\r\nmere charm of seeing such an idea constituent, in its degree; the\r\nfineness of the measures taken\xe2\x80\x94a real extension, if successful, of the\r\nvery terms and possibilities of representation and figuration\xe2\x80\x94such\r\nthings alone were, after this fashion, inspiring, such things alone\r\nwere a gage of the probable success of that dissimulated calculation\r\nwith which the whole effort was to square. But oh the cares begotten,\r\nnone the less, of that same \xe2\x80\x9cjudicious\xe2\x80\x9d sacrifice to a particular form\r\nof interest! One\xe2\x80\x99s work should have composition, because composition\r\nalone is positive beauty; but all the while\xe2\x80\x94apart from one\xe2\x80\x99s inevitable\r\nconsciousness too of the dire paucity of readers ever recognising or\r\never missing positive beauty\xe2\x80\x94how, as to the cheap and easy, at every\r\nturn, how, as to immediacy and facility, and even as to the commoner\r\nvivacity, positive beauty might have to be sweated for and paid for!\r\nOnce achieved and installed it may always be trusted to make the poor\r\nseeker feel he would have blushed to the roots of his hair for failing\r\nof it; yet, how, as its virtue can be essentially but the virtue of the\r\nwhole, the wayside traps set in the interest of muddlement and pleading\r\nbut the cause of the moment, of the particular bit in itself, have to\r\nbe kicked out of the path! All the sophistications in life, for\r\nexample, might have appeared to muster on behalf of the menace\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nmenace to a bright variety\xe2\x80\x94involved in Strether\xe2\x80\x99s having all the\r\nsubjective \xe2\x80\x9csay,\xe2\x80\x9d as it were, to himself.\r\n\r\nHad I, meanwhile, made him at once hero and historian, endowed him with\r\nthe romantic privilege of the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst person\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the darkest abyss of\r\nromance this, inveterately, when enjoyed on the grand scale\xe2\x80\x94variety,\r\nand many other queer matters as well, might have been smuggled in by a\r\nback door. Suffice it, to be brief, that the first person, in the long\r\npiece, is a form foredoomed to looseness and that looseness, never much\r\nmy affair, had never been so little so as on this particular occasion.\r\nAll of which reflexions flocked to the standard from the moment\xe2\x80\x94a very\r\nearly one\xe2\x80\x94the question of how to keep my form amusing while sticking so\r\nclose to my central figure and constantly taking its pattern from him\r\nhad to be faced. He arrives (arrives at Chester) as for the dreadful\r\npurpose of giving his creator \xe2\x80\x9cno end\xe2\x80\x9d to tell about him\xe2\x80\x94before which\r\nrigorous mission the serenest of creators might well have quailed. I\r\nwas far from the serenest; I was more than agitated enough to reflect\r\nthat, grimly deprived of one alternative or one substitute for\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctelling,\xe2\x80\x9d I must address myself tooth and nail to another. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nsave by implication, make other persons tell _each other_ about\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94blest resource, blest necessity, of the drama, which reaches its\r\neffects of unity, all remarkably, by paths absolutely opposite to the\r\npaths of the novel: with other persons, save as they were primarily\r\n_his_ persons (not he primarily but one of theirs), I had simply\r\nnothing to do. I had relations for him none the less, by the mercy of\r\nProvidence, quite as much as if my exhibition was to be a muddle; if I\r\ncould only by implication and a show of consequence make other persons\r\ntell each other about him, I could at least make him tell _them_\r\nwhatever in the world he must; and could so, by the same token\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nwas a further luxury thrown in\xe2\x80\x94see straight into the deep differences\r\nbetween what that could do for me, or at all events for _him_, and the\r\nlarge ease of \xe2\x80\x9cautobiography.\xe2\x80\x9d It may be asked why, if one so keeps to\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s hero, one shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make a single mouthful of \xe2\x80\x9cmethod,\xe2\x80\x9d shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthrow the reins on his neck and, letting them flap there as free as in\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGil Blas\xe2\x80\x9d or in \xe2\x80\x9cDavid Copperfield,\xe2\x80\x9d equip him with the double\r\nprivilege of subject and object\xe2\x80\x94a course that has at least the merit of\r\nbrushing away questions at a sweep. The answer to which is, I think,\r\nthat one makes that surrender only if one is prepared _not_ to make\r\ncertain precious discriminations.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cfirst person\xe2\x80\x9d then, so employed, is addressed by the author\r\ndirectly to ourselves, his possible readers, whom he has to reckon\r\nwith, at the best, by our English tradition, so loosely and vaguely\r\nafter all, so little respectfully, on so scant a presumption of\r\nexposure to criticism. Strether, on the other hand, encaged and\r\nprovided for as \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ambassadors\xe2\x80\x9d encages and provides, has to keep in\r\nview proprieties much stiffer and more salutary than any our straight\r\nand credulous gape are likely to bring home to him, has exhibitional\r\nconditions to meet, in a word, that forbid the terrible _fluidity_ of\r\nself-revelation. I may seem not to better the case for my\r\ndiscrimination if I say that, for my first care, I had thus inevitably\r\nto set him up a confidant or two, to wave away with energy the custom\r\nof the seated mass of explanation after the fact, the inserted block of\r\nmerely referential narrative, which flourishes so, to the shame of the\r\nmodern impatience, on the serried page of Balzac, but which seems\r\nsimply to appal our actual, our general weaker, digestion. \xe2\x80\x9cHarking\r\nback to make up\xe2\x80\x9d took at any rate more doing, as the phrase is, not\r\nonly than the reader of to-day demands, but than he will tolerate at\r\nany price any call upon him either to understand or remotely to\r\nmeasure; and for the beauty of the thing when done the current\r\neditorial mind in particular appears wholly without sense. It is not,\r\nhowever, primarily for either of these reasons, whatever their weight,\r\nthat Strether\xe2\x80\x99s friend Waymarsh is so keenly clutched at, on the\r\nthreshold of the book, or that no less a pounce is made on Maria\r\nGostrey\xe2\x80\x94without even the pretext, either, of _her_ being, in essence,\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s friend. She is the reader\xe2\x80\x99s friend much rather\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nconsequence of dispositions that make him so eminently require one; and\r\nshe acts in that capacity, and _really_ in that capacity alone, with\r\nexemplary devotion from beginning to and of the book. She is an\r\nenrolled, a direct, aid to lucidity; she is in fine, to tear off her\r\nmask, the most unmitigated and abandoned of _ficelles_. Half the\r\ndramatist\xe2\x80\x99s art, as we well know\xe2\x80\x94since if we don\xe2\x80\x99t it\xe2\x80\x99s not the fault\r\nof the proofs that lie scattered about us\xe2\x80\x94is in the use of _ficelles_;\r\nby which I mean in a deep dissimulation of his dependence on them.\r\nWaymarsh only to a slighter degree belongs, in the whole business, less\r\nto my subject than to my treatment of it; the interesting proof, in\r\nthese connexions, being that one has but to take one\xe2\x80\x99s subject for the\r\nstuff of drama to interweave with enthusiasm as many Gostreys as need\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nThe material of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ambassadors,\xe2\x80\x9d conforming in this respect exactly\r\nto that of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wings of the Dove,\xe2\x80\x9d published just before it, is taken\r\nabsolutely for the stuff of drama; so that, availing myself of the\r\nopportunity given me by this edition for some prefatory remarks on the\r\nlatter work, I had mainly to make on its behalf the point of its scenic\r\nconsistency. It disguises that virtue, in the oddest way in the world,\r\nby just _looking_, as we turn its pages, as little scenic as possible;\r\nbut it sharply divides itself, just as the composition before us does,\r\ninto the parts that prepare, that tend in fact to over-prepare, for\r\nscenes, and the parts, or otherwise into the scenes, that justify and\r\ncrown the preparation. It may definitely be said, I think, that\r\neverything in it that is not scene (not, I of course mean, complete and\r\nfunctional scene, treating _all_ the submitted matter, as by logical\r\nstart, logical turn, and logical finish) is discriminated preparation,\r\nis the fusion and synthesis of picture. These alternations propose\r\nthemselves all recogniseably, I think, from an early stage, as the very\r\nform and figure of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ambassadors\xe2\x80\x9d; so that, to repeat, such an agent\r\nas Miss Gostrey pre-engaged at a high salary, but waits in the draughty\r\nwing with her shawl and her smelling-salts. Her function speaks at once\r\nfor itself, and by the time she has dined with Strether in London and\r\ngone to a play with him her intervention as a _ficelle_ is, I hold,\r\nexpertly justified. Thanks to it we have treated scenically, and\r\nscenically alone, the whole lumpish question of Strether\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpast,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhich has seen us more happily on the way than anything else could have\r\ndone; we have strained to a high lucidity and vivacity (or at least we\r\nhope we have) certain indispensable facts; we have seen our two or\r\nthree immediate friends all conveniently and profitably in \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d; to\r\nsay nothing of our beginning to descry others, of a remoter intensity,\r\ngetting into motion, even if a bit vaguely as yet, for our further\r\nenrichment. Let my first point be here that the scene in question, that\r\nin which the whole situation at Woollett and the complex forces that\r\nhave propelled my hero to where this lively extractor of his value and\r\ndistiller of his essence awaits him, is normal and entire, is really an\r\nexcellent _standard_ scene; copious, comprehensive, and accordingly\r\nnever short, but with its office as definite as that of the hammer on\r\nthe gong of the clock, the office of expressing _all that is in_ the\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9c_ficelle_\xe2\x80\x9d character of the subordinate party is as artfully\r\ndissimulated, throughout, as may be, and to that extent that, with the\r\nseams or joints of Maria Gostrey\xe2\x80\x99s ostensible connectedness taken\r\nparticular care of, duly smoothed over, that is, and anxiously kept\r\nfrom showing as \xe2\x80\x9cpieced on,\xe2\x80\x9d this figure doubtless achieves, after a\r\nfashion, something of the dignity of a prime idea: which circumstance\r\nbut shows us afresh how many quite incalculable but none the less clear\r\nsources of enjoyment for the infatuated artist, how many copious\r\nsprings of our never-to-be-slighted \xe2\x80\x9cfun\xe2\x80\x9d for the reader and critic\r\nsusceptible of contagion, may sound their incidental plash as soon as\r\nan artistic process begins to enjoy free development. Exquisite\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nillustration of this\xe2\x80\x94the mere interest and amusement of such at once\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccreative\xe2\x80\x9d and critical questions as how and where and why to make Miss\r\nGostrey\xe2\x80\x99s false connexion carry itself, under a due high polish, as a\r\nreal one. Nowhere is it more of an artful expedient for mere\r\nconsistency of form, to mention a case, than in the last \xe2\x80\x9cscene\xe2\x80\x9d of the\r\nbook, where its function is to give or to add nothing whatever, but\r\nonly to express as vividly as possible certain things quite other than\r\nitself and that are of the already fixed and appointed measure. Since,\r\nhowever, all art is _expression_, and is thereby vividness, one was to\r\nfind the door open here to any amount of delightful dissimulation.\r\nThese verily are the refinements and ecstasies of method\xe2\x80\x94amid which, or\r\ncertainly under the influence of any exhilarated demonstration of\r\nwhich, one must keep one\xe2\x80\x99s head and not lose one\xe2\x80\x99s way. To cultivate an\r\nadequate intelligence for them and to make that sense operative is\r\npositively to find a charm in any produced ambiguity of appearance that\r\nis not by the same stroke, and all helplessly, an ambiguity of sense.\r\nTo project imaginatively, for my hero, a relation that has nothing to\r\ndo with the matter (the matter of my subject) but has everything to do\r\nwith the manner (the manner of my presentation of the same) and yet to\r\ntreat it, at close quarters and for fully economic expression\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npossible sake, as if it were important and essential\xe2\x80\x94to do that sort of\r\nthing and yet muddle nothing may easily become, as one goes, a signally\r\nattaching proposition; even though it all remains but part and parcel,\r\nI hasten to recognise, of the merely general and related question of\r\nexpressional curiosity and expressional decency.\r\n\r\nI am moved to add after so much insistence on the scenic side of my\r\nlabour that I have found the steps of re-perusal almost as much waylaid\r\nhere by quite another style of effort in the same signal interest\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nhave in other words not failed to note how, even so associated and so\r\ndiscriminated, the finest proprieties and charms of the non-scenic may,\r\nunder the right hand for them, still keep their intelligibility and\r\nassert their office. Infinitely suggestive such an observation as this\r\nlast on the whole delightful head, where representation is concerned,\r\nof possible variety, of effective expressional change and contrast. One\r\nwould like, at such an hour as this, for critical licence, to go into\r\nthe matter of the noted inevitable deviation (from too fond an original\r\nvision) that the exquisite treachery even of the straightest execution\r\nmay ever be trusted to inflict even on the most mature plan\xe2\x80\x94the case\r\nbeing that, though one\xe2\x80\x99s last reconsidered production always seems to\r\nbristle with that particular evidence, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ambassadors\xe2\x80\x9d would place a\r\nflood of such light at my service. I must attach to my final remark\r\nhere a different import; noting in the other connexion I just glanced\r\nat that such passages as that of my hero\xe2\x80\x99s first encounter with Chad\r\nNewsome, absolute attestations of the non-scenic form though they be,\r\nyet lay the firmest hand too\xe2\x80\x94so far at least as intention goes\xe2\x80\x94on\r\nrepresentational effect. To report at all closely and completely of\r\nwhat \xe2\x80\x9cpasses\xe2\x80\x9d on a given occasion is inevitably to become more or less\r\nscenic; and yet in the instance I allude to, _with_ the conveyance,\r\nexpressional curiosity and expressional decency are sought and arrived\r\nat under quite another law. The true inwardness of this may be at\r\nbottom but that one of the suffered treacheries has consisted\r\nprecisely, for Chad\xe2\x80\x99s whole figure and presence, of a direct\r\npresentability diminished and compromised\xe2\x80\x94despoiled, that is, of its\r\n_proportional_ advantage; so that, in a word, the whole economy of his\r\nauthor\xe2\x80\x99s relation to him has at important points to be redetermined.\r\nThe book, however, critically viewed, is touchingly full of these\r\ndisguised and repaired losses, these insidious recoveries, these\r\nintensely redemptive consistencies. The pages in which Mamie Pocock\r\ngives her appointed and, I can\xe2\x80\x99t but think, duly felt lift to the whole\r\naction by the so inscrutably-applied side-stroke or short-cut of our\r\njust watching and as quite at an angle of vision as yet untried, her\r\nsingle hour of suspense in the hotel salon, in our partaking of her\r\nconcentrated study of the sense of matters bearing on her own case, all\r\nthe bright warm Paris afternoon, from the balcony that overlooks the\r\nTuileries garden\xe2\x80\x94these are as marked an example of the representational\r\nvirtue that insists here and there on being, for the charm of\r\nopposition and renewal, other than the scenic. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take much to\r\nmake me further argue that from an equal play of such oppositions the\r\nbook gathers an intensity that fairly adds to the dramatic\xe2\x80\x94though the\r\nlatter is supposed to be the sum of all intensities; or that has at any\r\nrate nothing to fear from juxtaposition with it. I consciously fail to\r\nshrink in fact from that extravagance\xe2\x80\x94I risk it rather, for the sake of\r\nthe moral involved; which is not that the particular production before\r\nus exhausts the interesting questions it raises, but that the Novel\r\nremains still, under the right persuasion, the most independent, most\r\nelastic, most prodigious of literary forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n HENRY JAMES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook First\r\n\r\n\r\n I\r\n\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s first question, when he reached the hotel, was about his\r\nfriend; yet on his learning that Waymarsh was apparently not to arrive\r\ntill evening he was not wholly disconcerted. A telegram from him\r\nbespeaking a room \xe2\x80\x9conly if not noisy,\xe2\x80\x9d reply paid, was produced for the\r\nenquirer at the office, so that the understanding they should meet at\r\nChester rather than at Liverpool remained to that extent sound. The\r\nsame secret principle, however, that had prompted Strether not\r\nabsolutely to desire Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s presence at the dock, that had led him\r\nthus to postpone for a few hours his enjoyment of it, now operated to\r\nmake him feel he could still wait without disappointment. They would\r\ndine together at the worst, and, with all respect to dear old\r\nWaymarsh\xe2\x80\x94if not even, for that matter, to himself\xe2\x80\x94there was little fear\r\nthat in the sequel they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see enough of each other. The\r\nprinciple I have just mentioned as operating had been, with the most\r\nnewly disembarked of the two men, wholly instinctive\xe2\x80\x94the fruit of a\r\nsharp sense that, delightful as it would be to find himself looking,\r\nafter so much separation, into his comrade\xe2\x80\x99s face, his business would\r\nbe a trifle bungled should he simply arrange for this countenance to\r\npresent itself to the nearing steamer as the first \xe2\x80\x9cnote,\xe2\x80\x9d of Europe.\r\nMixed with everything was the apprehension, already, on Strether\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npart, that it would, at best, throughout, prove the note of Europe in\r\nquite a sufficient degree.\r\n\r\nThat note had been meanwhile\xe2\x80\x94since the previous afternoon, thanks to\r\nthis happier device\xe2\x80\x94such a consciousness of personal freedom as he\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t known for years; such a deep taste of change and of having above\r\nall for the moment nobody and nothing to consider, as promised already,\r\nif headlong hope were not too foolish, to colour his adventure with\r\ncool success. There were people on the ship with whom he had easily\r\nconsorted\xe2\x80\x94so far as ease could up to now be imputed to him\xe2\x80\x94and who for\r\nthe most part plunged straight into the current that set from the\r\nlanding-stage to London; there were others who had invited him to a\r\ntryst at the inn and had even invoked his aid for a \xe2\x80\x9clook round\xe2\x80\x9d at the\r\nbeauties of Liverpool; but he had stolen away from every one alike, had\r\nkept no appointment and renewed no acquaintance, had been indifferently\r\naware of the number of persons who esteemed themselves fortunate in\r\nbeing, unlike himself, \xe2\x80\x9cmet,\xe2\x80\x9d and had even independently, unsociably,\r\nalone, without encounter or relapse and by mere quiet evasion, given\r\nhis afternoon and evening to the immediate and the sensible. They\r\nformed a qualified draught of Europe, an afternoon and an evening on\r\nthe banks of the Mersey, but such as it was he took his potion at least\r\nundiluted. He winced a little, truly, at the thought that Waymarsh\r\nmight be already at Chester; he reflected that, should he have to\r\ndescribe himself there as having \xe2\x80\x9cgot in\xe2\x80\x9d so early, it would be\r\ndifficult to make the interval look particularly eager; but he was like\r\na man who, elatedly finding in his pocket more money than usual,\r\nhandles it a while and idly and pleasantly chinks it before addressing\r\nhimself to the business of spending. That he was prepared to be vague\r\nto Waymarsh about the hour of the ship\xe2\x80\x99s touching, and that he both\r\nwanted extremely to see him and enjoyed extremely the duration of\r\ndelay\xe2\x80\x94these things, it is to be conceived, were early signs in him that\r\nhis relation to his actual errand might prove none of the simplest. He\r\nwas burdened, poor Strether\xe2\x80\x94it had better be confessed at the\r\noutset\xe2\x80\x94with the oddity of a double consciousness. There was detachment\r\nin his zeal and curiosity in his indifference.\r\n\r\nAfter the young woman in the glass cage had held up to him across her\r\ncounter the pale-pink leaflet bearing his friend\xe2\x80\x99s name, which she\r\nneatly pronounced, he turned away to find himself, in the hall, facing\r\na lady who met his eyes as with an intention suddenly determined, and\r\nwhose features\xe2\x80\x94not freshly young, not markedly fine, but on happy terms\r\nwith each other\xe2\x80\x94came back to him as from a recent vision. For a moment\r\nthey stood confronted; then the moment placed her: he had noticed her\r\nthe day before, noticed her at his previous inn, where\xe2\x80\x94again in the\r\nhall\xe2\x80\x94she had been briefly engaged with some people of his own ship\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompany. Nothing had actually passed between them, and he would as\r\nlittle have been able to say what had been the sign of her face for him\r\non the first occasion as to name the ground of his present recognition.\r\nRecognition at any rate appeared to prevail on her own side as\r\nwell\xe2\x80\x94which would only have added to the mystery. All she now began by\r\nsaying to him nevertheless was that, having chanced to catch his\r\nenquiry, she was moved to ask, by his leave, if it were possibly a\r\nquestion of Mr. Waymarsh of Milrose Connecticut\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Waymarsh the\r\nAmerican lawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cmy very well-known friend. He\xe2\x80\x99s to meet me here,\r\ncoming up from Malvern, and I supposed he\xe2\x80\x99d already have arrived. But\r\nhe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come till later, and I\xe2\x80\x99m relieved not to have kept him. Do\r\nyou know him?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether wound up.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t till after he had spoken that he became aware of how much\r\nthere had been in him of response; when the tone of her own rejoinder,\r\nas well as the play of something more in her face\xe2\x80\x94something more, that\r\nis, than its apparently usual restless light\xe2\x80\x94seemed to notify him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve met him at Milrose\xe2\x80\x94where I used sometimes, a good while ago, to\r\nstay; I had friends there who were friends of his, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been at his\r\nhouse. I won\xe2\x80\x99t answer for it that he would know me,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether\xe2\x80\x99s new\r\nacquaintance pursued; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I should be delighted to see him. Perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe added, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall\xe2\x80\x94for I\xe2\x80\x99m staying over.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused while our friend\r\ntook in these things, and it was as if a good deal of talk had already\r\npassed. They even vaguely smiled at it, and Strether presently observed\r\nthat Mr. Waymarsh would, no doubt, be easily to be seen. This, however,\r\nappeared to affect the lady as if she might have advanced too far. She\r\nappeared to have no reserves about anything. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9che won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and she immediately thereupon remarked that she believed\r\nStrether knew the Munsters; the Munsters being the people he had seen\r\nher with at Liverpool.\r\n\r\nBut he didn\xe2\x80\x99t, it happened, know the Munsters well enough to give the\r\ncase much of a lift; so that they were left together as if over the\r\nmere laid table of conversation. Her qualification of the mentioned\r\nconnexion had rather removed than placed a dish, and there seemed\r\nnothing else to serve. Their attitude remained, none the less, that of\r\nnot forsaking the board; and the effect of this in turn was to give\r\nthem the appearance of having accepted each other with an absence of\r\npreliminaries practically complete. They moved along the hall together,\r\nand Strether\xe2\x80\x99s companion threw off that the hotel had the advantage of\r\na garden. He was aware by this time of his strange inconsequence: he\r\nhad shirked the intimacies of the steamer and had muffled the shock of\r\nWaymarsh only to find himself forsaken, in this sudden case, both of\r\navoidance and of caution. He passed, under this unsought protection and\r\nbefore he had so much as gone up to his room, into the garden of the\r\nhotel, and at the end of ten minutes had agreed to meet there again, as\r\nsoon as he should have made himself tidy, the dispenser of such good\r\nassurances. He wanted to look at the town, and they would forthwith\r\nlook together. It was almost as if she had been in possession and\r\nreceived him as a guest. Her acquaintance with the place presented her\r\nin a manner as a hostess, and Strether had a rueful glance for the lady\r\nin the glass cage. It was as if this personage had seen herself\r\ninstantly superseded.\r\n\r\nWhen in a quarter of an hour he came down, what his hostess saw, what\r\nshe might have taken in with a vision kindly adjusted, was the lean,\r\nthe slightly loose figure of a man of the middle height and something\r\nmore perhaps than the middle age\xe2\x80\x94a man of five-and-fifty, whose most\r\nimmediate signs were a marked bloodless brownness of face, a thick dark\r\nmoustache, of characteristically American cut, growing strong and\r\nfalling low, a head of hair still abundant but irregularly streaked\r\nwith grey, and a nose of bold free prominence, the even line, the high\r\nfinish, as it might have been called, of which, had a certain effect of\r\nmitigation. A perpetual pair of glasses astride of this fine ridge, and\r\na line, unusually deep and drawn, the prolonged pen-stroke of time,\r\naccompanying the curve of the moustache from nostril to chin, did\r\nsomething to complete the facial furniture that an attentive observer\r\nwould have seen catalogued, on the spot, in the vision of the other\r\nparty to Strether\xe2\x80\x99s appointment. She waited for him in the garden, the\r\nother party, drawing on a pair of singularly fresh soft and elastic\r\nlight gloves and presenting herself with a superficial readiness which,\r\nas he approached her over the small smooth lawn and in the watery\r\nEnglish sunshine, he might, with his rougher preparation, have marked\r\nas the model for such an occasion. She had, this lady, a perfect plain\r\npropriety, an expensive subdued suitability, that her companion was not\r\nfree to analyse, but that struck him, so that his consciousness of it\r\nwas instantly acute, as a quality quite new to him. Before reaching her\r\nhe stopped on the grass and went through the form of feeling for\r\nsomething, possibly forgotten, in the light overcoat he carried on his\r\narm; yet the essence of the act was no more than the impulse to gain\r\ntime. Nothing could have been odder than Strether\xe2\x80\x99s sense of himself as\r\nat that moment launched in something of which the sense would be quite\r\ndisconnected from the sense of his past and which was literally\r\nbeginning there and then. It had begun in fact already upstairs and\r\nbefore the dressing glass that struck him as blocking further, so\r\nstrangely, the dimness of the window of his dull bedroom; begun with a\r\nsharper survey of the elements of Appearance than he had for a long\r\ntime been moved to make. He had during those moments felt these\r\nelements to be not so much to his hand as he should have liked, and\r\nthen had fallen back on the thought that they were precisely a matter\r\nas to which help was supposed to come from what he was about to do. He\r\nwas about to go up to London, so that hat and necktie might wait. What\r\nhad come as straight to him as a ball in a well-played game\xe2\x80\x94and caught\r\nmoreover not less neatly\xe2\x80\x94was just the air, in the person of his friend,\r\nof having seen and chosen, the air of achieved possession of those\r\nvague qualities and quantities that collectively figured to him as the\r\nadvantage snatched from lucky chances. Without pomp or circumstance,\r\ncertainly, as her original address to him, equally with his own\r\nresponse, had been, he would have sketched to himself his impression of\r\nher as: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, she\xe2\x80\x99s more thoroughly civilized\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d If \xe2\x80\x9cMore thoroughly\r\nthan _whom?_\xe2\x80\x9d would not have been for him a sequel to this remark, that\r\nwas just by reason of his deep consciousness of the bearing of his\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\nThe amusement, at all events, of a civilisation intenser was\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x94familiar compatriot as she was, with the full tone of the\r\ncompatriot and the rattling link not with mystery but only with dear\r\ndyspeptic Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x94she appeared distinctly to promise. His pause while\r\nhe felt in his overcoat was positively the pause of confidence, and it\r\nenabled his eyes to make out as much of a case for her, in proportion,\r\nas her own made out for himself. She affected him as almost insolently\r\nyoung; but an easily carried five-and-thirty could still do that. She\r\nwas, however, like himself marked and wan; only it naturally couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave been known to him how much a spectator looking from one to the\r\nother might have discerned that they had in common. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t for\r\nsuch a spectator have been altogether insupposable that, each so finely\r\nbrown and so sharply spare, each confessing so to dents of surface and\r\naids to sight, to a disproportionate nose and a head delicately or\r\ngrossly grizzled, they might have been brother and sister. On this\r\nground indeed there would have been a residuum of difference; such a\r\nsister having surely known in respect to such a brother the extremity\r\nof separation, and such a brother now feeling in respect to such a\r\nsister the extremity of surprise. Surprise, it was true, was not on the\r\nother hand what the eyes of Strether\xe2\x80\x99s friend most showed him while she\r\ngave him, stroking her gloves smoother, the time he appreciated. They\r\nhad taken hold of him straightway measuring him up and down as if they\r\nknew how; as if he were human material they had already in some sort\r\nhandled. Their possessor was in truth, it may be communicated, the\r\nmistress of a hundred cases or categories, receptacles of the mind,\r\nsubdivisions for convenience, in which, from a full experience, she\r\npigeon-holed her fellow mortals with a hand as free as that of a\r\ncompositor scattering type. She was as equipped in this particular as\r\nStrether was the reverse, and it made an opposition between them which\r\nhe might well have shrunk from submitting to if he had fully suspected\r\nit. So far as he did suspect it he was on the contrary, after a short\r\nshake of his consciousness, as pleasantly passive as might be. He\r\nreally had a sort of sense of what she knew. He had quite the sense\r\nthat she knew things he didn\xe2\x80\x99t, and though this was a concession that\r\nin general he found not easy to make to women, he made it now as\r\ngood-humouredly as if it lifted a burden. His eyes were so quiet behind\r\nhis eternal nippers that they might almost have been absent without\r\nchanging his face, which took its expression mainly, and not least its\r\nstamp of sensibility, from other sources, surface and grain and form.\r\nHe joined his guide in an instant, and then felt she had profited still\r\nbetter than he by his having been for the moments just mentioned, so at\r\nthe disposal of her intelligence. She knew even intimate things about\r\nhim that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet told her and perhaps never would. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunaware that he had told her rather remarkably many for the time, but\r\nthese were not the real ones. Some of the real ones, however,\r\nprecisely, were what she knew.\r\n\r\nThey were to pass again through the hall of the inn to get into the\r\nstreet, and it was here she presently checked him with a question.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you looked up my name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could only stop with a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you looked up mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, yes\xe2\x80\x94as soon as you left me. I went to the office and asked.\r\nHadn\xe2\x80\x99t _you_ better do the same?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cFind out who you are?\xe2\x80\x94after the uplifted young woman\r\nthere has seen us thus scrape acquaintance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed on her side now at the shade of alarm in his amusement.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it a reason the more? If what you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of is the injury for\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94my being seen to walk off with a gentleman who has to ask who I am\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nassure you I don\xe2\x80\x99t in the least mind. Here, however,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis my card, and as I find there\xe2\x80\x99s something else again I have to say\r\nat the office, you can just study it during the moment I leave you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe left him after he had taken from her the small pasteboard she had\r\nextracted from her pocket-book, and he had extracted another from his\r\nown, to exchange with it, before she came back. He read thus the simple\r\ndesignation \xe2\x80\x9cMaria Gostrey,\xe2\x80\x9d to which was attached, in a corner of the\r\ncard, with a number, the name of a street, presumably in Paris, without\r\nother appreciable identity than its foreignness. He put the card into\r\nhis waistcoat pocket, keeping his own meanwhile in evidence; and as he\r\nleaned against the door-post he met with the smile of a straying\r\nthought what the expanse before the hotel offered to his view. It was\r\npositively droll to him that he should already have Maria Gostrey,\r\nwhoever she was\xe2\x80\x94of which he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t really the least idea\xe2\x80\x94in a place of\r\nsafe keeping. He had somehow an assurance that he should carefully\r\npreserve the little token he had just tucked in. He gazed with unseeing\r\nlingering eyes as he followed some of the implications of his act,\r\nasking himself if he really felt admonished to qualify it as disloyal.\r\nIt was prompt, it was possibly even premature, and there was little\r\ndoubt of the expression of face the sight of it would have produced in\r\na certain person. But if it was \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94why then he had better not have\r\ncome out at all. At this, poor man, had he already\xe2\x80\x94and even before\r\nmeeting Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x94arrived. He had believed he had a limit, but the limit\r\nhad been transcended within thirty-six hours. By how long a space on\r\nthe plane of manners or even of morals, moreover, he felt still more\r\nsharply after Maria Gostrey had come back to him and with a gay\r\ndecisive \xe2\x80\x9cSo now\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d led him forth into the world. This counted, it\r\nstruck him as he walked beside her with his overcoat on an arm, his\r\numbrella under another and his personal pasteboard a little stiffly\r\nretained between forefinger and thumb, this struck him as really, in\r\ncomparison his introduction to things. It hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been \xe2\x80\x9cEurope\xe2\x80\x9d at\r\nLiverpool no\xe2\x80\x94not even in the dreadful delightful impressive streets the\r\nnight before\xe2\x80\x94to the extent his present companion made it so. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyet done that so much as when, after their walk had lasted a few\r\nminutes and he had had time to wonder if a couple of sidelong glances\r\nfrom her meant that he had best have put on gloves she almost pulled\r\nhim up with an amused challenge. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why\xe2\x80\x94fondly as it\xe2\x80\x99s so easy to\r\nimagine your clinging to it\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you put it away? Or if it\xe2\x80\x99s an\r\ninconvenience to you to carry it, one\xe2\x80\x99s often glad to have one\xe2\x80\x99s card\r\nback. The fortune one spends in them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he saw both that his way of marching with his own prepared tribute\r\nhad affected her as a deviation in one of those directions he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyet measure, and that she supposed this emblem to be still the one he\r\nhad received from her. He accordingly handed her the card as if in\r\nrestitution, but as soon as she had it she felt the difference and,\r\nwith her eyes on it, stopped short for apology. \xe2\x80\x9cI like,\xe2\x80\x9d she observed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyour name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cyou won\xe2\x80\x99t have heard of it!\xe2\x80\x9d Yet he had his reasons\r\nfor not being sure but that she perhaps might.\r\n\r\nAh it was but too visible! She read it over again as one who had never\r\nseen it. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Lewis Lambert Strether\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she sounded it almost as freely\r\nas for any stranger. She repeated however that she liked\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cparticularly the Lewis Lambert. It\xe2\x80\x99s the name of a novel of\r\nBalzac\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I know that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the novel\xe2\x80\x99s an awfully bad one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that too,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether smiled. To which he added with an\r\nirrelevance that was only superficial: \xe2\x80\x9cI come from Woollett\r\nMassachusetts.\xe2\x80\x9d It made her for some reason\xe2\x80\x94the irrelevance or\r\nwhatever\xe2\x80\x94laugh. Balzac had described many cities, but hadn\xe2\x80\x99t described\r\nWoollett Massachusetts. \xe2\x80\x9cYou say that,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, \xe2\x80\x9cas if you wanted\r\none immediately to know the worst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you must already have made\r\nout. I feel it so that I certainly must look it, speak it, and, as\r\npeople say there, \xe2\x80\x98act\xe2\x80\x99 it. It sticks out of me, and you knew surely\r\nfor yourself as soon as you looked at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe worst, you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the fact of where I come from. There at any rate it _is_; so\r\nthat you won\xe2\x80\x99t be able, if anything happens, to say I\xe2\x80\x99ve not been\r\nstraight with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and Miss Gostrey looked really interested in the point he had\r\nmade. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what do you think of as happening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t shy\xe2\x80\x94which was rather anomalous\xe2\x80\x94Strether gazed about\r\nwithout meeting her eyes; a motion that was frequent with him in talk,\r\nyet of which his words often seemed not at all the effect. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy that\r\nyou should find me too hopeless.\xe2\x80\x9d With which they walked on again\r\ntogether while she answered, as they went, that the most \xe2\x80\x9chopeless\xe2\x80\x9d of\r\nher countryfolk were in general precisely those she liked best. All\r\nsorts of other pleasant small things\xe2\x80\x94small things that were yet large\r\nfor him\xe2\x80\x94flowered in the air of the occasion, but the bearing of the\r\noccasion itself on matters still remote concerns us too closely to\r\npermit us to multiply our illustrations. Two or three, however, in\r\ntruth, we should perhaps regret to lose. The tortuous wall\xe2\x80\x94girdle, long\r\nsince snapped, of the little swollen city, half held in place by\r\ncareful civic hands\xe2\x80\x94wanders in narrow file between parapets smoothed by\r\npeaceful generations, pausing here and there for a dismantled gate or a\r\nbridged gap, with rises and drops, steps up and steps down, queer\r\ntwists, queer contacts, peeps into homely streets and under the brows\r\nof gables, views of cathedral tower and waterside fields, of huddled\r\nEnglish town and ordered English country. Too deep almost for words was\r\nthe delight of these things to Strether; yet as deeply mixed with it\r\nwere certain images of his inward picture. He had trod this walks in\r\nthe far-off time, at twenty-five; but that, instead of spoiling it,\r\nonly enriched it for present feeling and marked his renewal as a thing\r\nsubstantial enough to share. It was with Waymarsh he should have shared\r\nit, and he was now accordingly taking from him something that was his\r\ndue. He looked repeatedly at his watch, and when he had done so for the\r\nfifth time Miss Gostrey took him up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re doing something that you think not right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt so touched the place that he quite changed colour and his laugh grew\r\nalmost awkward. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I enjoying it as much as _that?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not enjoying it, I think, so much as you ought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he appeared thoughtfully to agree. \xe2\x80\x9cGreat is my privilege.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh it\xe2\x80\x99s not your privilege! It has nothing to do with _me_. It has to\r\ndo with yourself. Your failure\xe2\x80\x99s general.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh there you are!\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the failure of Woollett. _That\xe2\x80\x99s_\r\ngeneral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe failure to enjoy,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Gostrey explained, \xe2\x80\x9cis what I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely. Woollett isn\xe2\x80\x99t sure it ought to enjoy. If it were it would.\r\nBut it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t, poor thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether continued, \xe2\x80\x9cany one to show it\r\nhow. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like me. I have somebody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had stopped, in the afternoon sunshine\xe2\x80\x94constantly pausing, in\r\ntheir stroll, for the sharper sense of what they saw\xe2\x80\x94and Strether\r\nrested on one of the high sides of the old stony groove of the little\r\nrampart. He leaned back on this support with his face to the tower of\r\nthe cathedral, now admirably commanded by their station, the high\r\nred-brown mass, square and subordinately spired and crocketed,\r\nretouched and restored, but charming to his long-sealed eyes and with\r\nthe first swallows of the year weaving their flight all round it. Miss\r\nGostrey lingered near him, full of an air, to which she more and more\r\njustified her right, of understanding the effect of things. She quite\r\nconcurred. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve indeed somebody.\xe2\x80\x9d And she added: \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you _would_\r\nlet me show you how!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of you!\xe2\x80\x9d he cheerfully pleaded.\r\n\r\nShe kept on him a moment, through her glasses and through his own, a\r\ncertain pleasant pointedness. \xe2\x80\x9cAh no, you\xe2\x80\x99re not! You\xe2\x80\x99re not in the\r\nleast, thank goodness! If you had been we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t so soon have found\r\nourselves here together. I think,\xe2\x80\x9d she comfortably concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\ntrust me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I do!\xe2\x80\x94but that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\nif I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s falling thus in twenty minutes so utterly into your\r\nhands. I dare say,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether continued, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a sort of thing you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nthoroughly familiar with; but nothing more extraordinary has ever\r\nhappened to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe watched him with all her kindness. \xe2\x80\x9cThat means simply that you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nrecognised me\xe2\x80\x94which _is_ rather beautiful and rare. You see what I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAs on this, however, he protested, with a good-humoured headshake, a\r\nresignation of any such claim, she had a moment of explanation. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll only come on further as you _have_ come you\xe2\x80\x99ll at any rate make\r\nout. My own fate has been too many for me, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve succumbed to it.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a general guide\xe2\x80\x94to \xe2\x80\x98Europe,\xe2\x80\x99 don\xe2\x80\x99t you know? I wait for people\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nput them through. I pick them up\xe2\x80\x94I set them down. I\xe2\x80\x99m a sort of\r\nsuperior \xe2\x80\x98courier-maid.\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m a companion at large. I take people, as\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve told you, about. I never sought it\xe2\x80\x94it has come to me. It has been\r\nmy fate, and one\xe2\x80\x99s fate one accepts. It\xe2\x80\x99s a dreadful thing to have to\r\nsay, in so wicked a world, but I verily believe that, such as you see\r\nme, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I know all the shops and the\r\nprices\xe2\x80\x94but I know worse things still. I bear on my back the huge load\r\nof our national consciousness, or, in other words\xe2\x80\x94for it comes to\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94of our nation itself. Of what is our nation composed but of the\r\nmen and women individually on my shoulders? I don\xe2\x80\x99t do it, you know,\r\nfor any particular advantage. I don\xe2\x80\x99t do it, for instance\xe2\x80\x94some people\r\ndo, you know\xe2\x80\x94for money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether could only listen and wonder and weigh his chance. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\r\naffected as you are then to so many of your clients, you can scarcely\r\nbe said to do it for love.\xe2\x80\x9d He waited a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do we reward you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had her own hesitation, but \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d she finally returned,\r\nsetting him again in motion. They went on, but in a few minutes, though\r\nwhile still thinking over what she had said, he once more took out his\r\nwatch; mechanically, unconsciously and as if made nervous by the mere\r\nexhilaration of what struck him as her strange and cynical wit. He\r\nlooked at the hour without seeing it, and then, on something again said\r\nby his companion, had another pause. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re really in terror of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled a smile that he almost felt to be sickly. \xe2\x80\x9cNow you can see\r\nwhy I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I\xe2\x80\x99ve such illuminations? Why they\xe2\x80\x99re all for your help! It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat I told you,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cjust now. You feel as if this were\r\nwrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe fell back once more, settling himself against the parapet as if to\r\nhear more about it. \xe2\x80\x9cThen get me out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer face fairly brightened for the joy of the appeal, but, as if it\r\nwere a question of immediate action, she visibly considered. \xe2\x80\x9cOut of\r\nwaiting for him?\xe2\x80\x94of seeing him at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94not that,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Strether, looking grave. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got to wait\r\nfor him\xe2\x80\x94and I want very much to see him. But out of the terror. You did\r\nput your finger on it a few minutes ago. It\xe2\x80\x99s general, but it avails\r\nitself of particular occasions. That\xe2\x80\x99s what it\xe2\x80\x99s doing for me now. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nalways considering something else; something else, I mean, than the\r\nthing of the moment. The obsession of the other thing is the terror.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m considering at present for instance something else than _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe listened with charming earnestness. \xe2\x80\x9cOh you oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to do that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s what I admit. Make it then impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe continued to think. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it really an \xe2\x80\x98order\xe2\x80\x99 from you?\xe2\x80\x94that I shall\r\ntake the job? _Will_ you give yourself up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Strether heaved his sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I only could! But that\xe2\x80\x99s the deuce\r\nof it\xe2\x80\x94that I never can. No\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, however, discouraged. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you want to at least?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh unspeakably!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh then, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll try!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and she took over the job, as she had called\r\nit, on the spot. \xe2\x80\x9cTrust me!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, and the action of this, as\r\nthey retraced their steps, was presently to make him pass his hand into\r\nher arm in the manner of a benign dependent paternal old person who\r\nwishes to be \xe2\x80\x9cnice\xe2\x80\x9d to a younger one. If he drew it out again indeed as\r\nthey approached the inn this may have been because, after more talk had\r\npassed between them, the relation of age, or at least of\r\nexperience\xe2\x80\x94which, for that matter, had already played to and fro with\r\nsome freedom\xe2\x80\x94affected him as incurring a readjustment. It was at all\r\nevents perhaps lucky that they arrived in sufficiently separate fashion\r\nwithin range of the hotel-door. The young lady they had left in the\r\nglass cage watched as if she had come to await them on the threshold.\r\nAt her side stood a person equally interested, by his attitude, in\r\ntheir return, and the effect of the sight of whom was instantly to\r\ndetermine for Strether another of those responsive arrests that we have\r\nhad so repeatedly to note. He left it to Miss Gostrey to name, with the\r\nfine full bravado as it almost struck him, of her \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Waymarsh!\xe2\x80\x9d what\r\nwas to have been, what\xe2\x80\x94he more than ever felt as his short stare of\r\nsuspended welcome took things in\xe2\x80\x94would have been, but for herself, his\r\ndoom. It was already upon him even at that distance\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Waymarsh was\r\nfor _his_ part joyless.\r\n\r\n\r\n II\r\n\r\nHe had none the less to confess to this friend that evening that he\r\nknew almost nothing about her, and it was a deficiency that Waymarsh,\r\neven with his memory refreshed by contact, by her own prompt and lucid\r\nallusions and enquiries, by their having publicly partaken of dinner in\r\nher company, and by another stroll, to which she was not a stranger,\r\nout into the town to look at the cathedral by moonlight\xe2\x80\x94it was a blank\r\nthat the resident of Milrose, though admitting acquaintance with the\r\nMunsters, professed himself unable to fill. He had no recollection of\r\nMiss Gostrey, and two or three questions that she put to him about\r\nthose members of his circle had, to Strether\xe2\x80\x99s observation, the same\r\neffect he himself had already more directly felt\xe2\x80\x94the effect of\r\nappearing to place all knowledge, for the time, on this original\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s side. It interested him indeed to mark the limits of any such\r\nrelation for her with his friend as there could possibly be a question\r\nof, and it particularly struck him that they were to be marked\r\naltogether in Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s quarter. This added to his own sense of having\r\ngone far with her\xe2\x80\x94gave him an early illustration of a much shorter\r\ncourse. There was a certitude he immediately grasped\xe2\x80\x94a conviction that\r\nWaymarsh would quite fail, as it were, and on whatever degree of\r\nacquaintances to profit by her.\r\n\r\nThere had been after the first interchange among the three a talk of\r\nsome five minutes in the hall, and then the two men had adjourned to\r\nthe garden, Miss Gostrey for the time disappearing. Strether in due\r\ncourse accompanied his friend to the room he had bespoken and had,\r\nbefore going out, scrupulously visited; where at the end of another\r\nhalf-hour he had no less discreetly left him. On leaving him he\r\nrepaired straight to his own room, but with the prompt effect of\r\nfeeling the compass of that chamber resented by his condition. There he\r\nenjoyed at once the first consequence of their reunion. A place was too\r\nsmall for him after it that had seemed large enough before. He had\r\nawaited it with something he would have been sorry, have been almost\r\nashamed not to recognise as emotion, yet with a tacit assumption at the\r\nsame time that emotion would in the event find itself relieved. The\r\nactual oddity was that he was only more excited; and his excitement\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nwhich indeed he would have found it difficult instantly to give a\r\nname\xe2\x80\x94brought him once more downstairs and caused him for some minutes\r\nvaguely to wander. He went once more to the garden; he looked into the\r\npublic room, found Miss Gostrey writing letters and backed out; he\r\nroamed, fidgeted and wasted time; but he was to have his more intimate\r\nsession with his friend before the evening closed.\r\n\r\nIt was late\xe2\x80\x94not till Strether had spent an hour upstairs with him\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nthis subject consented to betake himself to doubtful rest. Dinner and\r\nthe subsequent stroll by moonlight\xe2\x80\x94a dream, on Strether\xe2\x80\x99s part, of\r\nromantic effects rather prosaically merged in a mere missing of thicker\r\ncoats\xe2\x80\x94had measurably intervened, and this midnight conference was the\r\nresult of Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s having (when they were free, as he put it, of\r\ntheir fashionable friend) found the smoking-room not quite what he\r\nwanted, and yet bed what he wanted less. His most frequent form of\r\nwords was that he knew himself, and they were applied on this occasion\r\nto his certainty of not sleeping. He knew himself well enough to know\r\nthat he should have a night of prowling unless he should succeed, as a\r\npreliminary, in getting prodigiously tired. If the effort directed to\r\nthis end involved till a late hour the presence of Strether\xe2\x80\x94consisted,\r\nthat is, in the detention of the latter for full discourse\xe2\x80\x94there was\r\nyet an impression of minor discipline involved for our friend in the\r\npicture Waymarsh made as he sat in trousers and shirt on the edge of\r\nhis couch. With his long legs extended and his large back much bent, he\r\nnursed alternately, for an almost incredible time, his elbows and his\r\nbeard. He struck his visitor as extremely, as almost wilfully\r\nuncomfortable; yet what had this been for Strether, from that first\r\nglimpse of him disconcerted in the porch of the hotel, but the\r\npredominant notes. The discomfort was in a manner contagious, as well\r\nas also in a manner inconsequent and unfounded; the visitor felt that\r\nunless he should get used to it\xe2\x80\x94or unless Waymarsh himself should\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwould constitute a menace for his own prepared, his own already\r\nconfirmed, consciousness of the agreeable. On their first going up\r\ntogether to the room Strether had selected for him Waymarsh had looked\r\nit over in silence and with a sigh that represented for his companion,\r\nif not the habit of disapprobation, at least the despair of felicity;\r\nand this look had recurred to Strether as the key of much he had since\r\nobserved. \xe2\x80\x9cEurope,\xe2\x80\x9d he had begun to gather from these things, had up to\r\nnow rather failed of its message to him; he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got into tune with\r\nit and had at the end of three months almost renounced any such\r\nexpectation.\r\n\r\nHe really appeared at present to insist on that by just perching there\r\nwith the gas in his eyes. This of itself somehow conveyed the futility\r\nof single rectifications in a multiform failure. He had a large\r\nhandsome head and a large sallow seamed face\xe2\x80\x94a striking significant\r\nphysiognomic total, the upper range of which, the great political brow,\r\nthe thick loose hair, the dark fuliginous eyes, recalled even to a\r\ngeneration whose standard had dreadfully deviated the impressive image,\r\nfamiliar by engravings and busts, of some great national worthy of the\r\nearlier part of the mid-century. He was of the personal type\xe2\x80\x94and it was\r\nan element in the power and promise that in their early time Strether\r\nhad found in him\xe2\x80\x94of the American statesman, the statesman trained in\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCongressional halls,\xe2\x80\x9d of an elder day. The legend had been in later\r\nyears that as the lower part of his face, which was weak, and slightly\r\ncrooked, spoiled the likeness, this was the real reason for the growth\r\nof his beard, which might have seemed to spoil it for those not in the\r\nsecret. He shook his mane; he fixed, with his admirable eyes, his\r\nauditor or his observer; he wore no glasses and had a way, partly\r\nformidable, yet also partly encouraging, as from a representative to a\r\nconstituent, of looking very hard at those who approached him. He met\r\nyou as if you had knocked and he had bidden you enter. Strether, who\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen him for so long an interval, apprehended him now with a\r\nfreshness of taste, and had perhaps never done him such ideal justice.\r\nThe head was bigger, the eyes finer, than they need have been for the\r\ncareer; but that only meant, after all, that the career was itself\r\nexpressive. What it expressed at midnight in the gas-glaring bedroom at\r\nChester was that the subject of it had, at the end of years, barely\r\nescaped, by flight in time, a general nervous collapse. But this very\r\nproof of the full life, as the full life was understood at Milrose,\r\nwould have made to Strether\xe2\x80\x99s imagination an element in which Waymarsh\r\ncould have floated easily had he only consented to float. Alas nothing\r\nso little resembled floating as the rigour with which, on the edge of\r\nhis bed, he hugged his posture of prolonged impermanence. It suggested\r\nto his comrade something that always, when kept up, worried him\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nperson established in a railway-coach with a forward inclination. It\r\nrepresented the angle at which poor Waymarsh was to sit through the\r\nordeal of Europe.\r\n\r\nThanks to the stress of occupation, the strain of professions, the\r\nabsorption and embarrassment of each, they had not, at home, during\r\nyears before this sudden brief and almost bewildering reign of\r\ncomparative ease, found so much as a day for a meeting; a fact that was\r\nin some degree an explanation of the sharpness with which most of his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s features stood out to Strether. Those he had lost sight of\r\nsince the early time came back to him; others that it was never\r\npossible to forget struck him now as sitting, clustered and expectant,\r\nlike a somewhat defiant family-group, on the doorstep of their\r\nresidence. The room was narrow for its length, and the occupant of the\r\nbed thrust so far a pair of slippered feet that the visitor had almost\r\nto step over them in his recurrent rebounds from his chair to fidget\r\nback and forth. There were marks the friends made on things to talk\r\nabout, and on things not to, and one of the latter in particular fell\r\nlike the tap of chalk on the blackboard. Married at thirty, Waymarsh\r\nhad not lived with his wife for fifteen years, and it came up vividly\r\nbetween them in the glare of the gas that Strether wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to ask about\r\nher. He knew they were still separate and that she lived at hotels,\r\ntravelled in Europe, painted her face and wrote her husband abusive\r\nletters, of not one of which, to a certainty, that sufferer spared\r\nhimself the perusal; but he respected without difficulty the cold\r\ntwilight that had settled on this side of his companion\xe2\x80\x99s life. It was\r\na province in which mystery reigned and as to which Waymarsh had never\r\nspoken the informing word. Strether, who wanted to do him the highest\r\njustice wherever he _could_ do it, singularly admired him for the\r\ndignity of this reserve, and even counted it as one of the\r\ngrounds\xe2\x80\x94grounds all handled and numbered\xe2\x80\x94for ranking him, in the range\r\nof their acquaintance, as a success. He _was_ a success, Waymarsh, in\r\nspite of overwork, or prostration, of sensible shrinkage, of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletters and of his not liking Europe. Strether would have reckoned his\r\nown career less futile had he been able to put into it anything so\r\nhandsome as so much fine silence. One might one\xe2\x80\x99s self easily have left\r\nMrs. Waymarsh; and one would assuredly have paid one\xe2\x80\x99s tribute to the\r\nideal in covering with that attitude the derision of having been left\r\nby her. Her husband had held his tongue and had made a large income;\r\nand these were in especial the achievements as to which Strether envied\r\nhim. Our friend had had indeed on his side too a subject for silence,\r\nwhich he fully appreciated; but it was a matter of a different sort,\r\nand the figure of the income he had arrived at had never been high\r\nenough to look any one in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know as I quite see what you require it for. You don\xe2\x80\x99t appear\r\nsick to speak of.\xe2\x80\x9d It was of Europe Waymarsh thus finally spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, who fell as much as possible into step, \xe2\x80\x9cI guess\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t _feel_ sick now that I\xe2\x80\x99ve started. But I had pretty well run\r\ndown before I did start.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaymarsh raised his melancholy look. \xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t you about up to your usual\r\naverage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not quite pointedly sceptical, but it seemed somehow a plea for\r\nthe purest veracity, and it thereby affected our friend as the very\r\nvoice of Milrose. He had long since made a mental distinction\xe2\x80\x94though\r\nnever in truth daring to betray it\xe2\x80\x94between the voice of Milrose and the\r\nvoice even of Woollett. It was the former he felt, that was most in the\r\nreal tradition. There had been occasions in his past when the sound of\r\nit had reduced him to temporary confusion, and the present, for some\r\nreason, suddenly became such another. It was nevertheless no light\r\nmatter that the very effect of his confusion should be to make him\r\nagain prevaricate. \xe2\x80\x9cThat description hardly does justice to a man to\r\nwhom it has done such a lot of good to see _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaymarsh fixed on his washing-stand the silent detached stare with\r\nwhich Milrose in person, as it were, might have marked the\r\nunexpectedness of a compliment from Woollett, and Strether for his\r\npart, felt once more like Woollett in person. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean,\xe2\x80\x9d his friend\r\npresently continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your appearance isn\xe2\x80\x99t as bad as I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen\r\nit: it compares favourably with what it was when I last noticed it.\xe2\x80\x9d On\r\nthis appearance Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s eyes yet failed to rest; it was almost as if\r\nthey obeyed an instinct of propriety, and the effect was still stronger\r\nwhen, always considering the basin and jug, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve filled\r\nout some since then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I have,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether laughed: \xe2\x80\x9cone does fill out some with all\r\none takes in, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken in, I dare say, more than I\xe2\x80\x99ve natural\r\nroom for. I was dog-tired when I sailed.\xe2\x80\x9d It had the oddest sound of\r\ncheerfulness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ was dog-tired,\xe2\x80\x9d his companion returned, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I arrived, and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthis wild hunt for rest that takes all the life out of me. The fact is,\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x94and it\xe2\x80\x99s a comfort to have you here at last to say it to;\r\nthough I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, after all, that I\xe2\x80\x99ve really waited; I\xe2\x80\x99ve told it\r\nto people I\xe2\x80\x99ve met in the cars\xe2\x80\x94the fact is, such a country as this\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t my _kind_ of country anyway. There ain\xe2\x80\x99t a country I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over\r\nhere that _does_ seem my kind. Oh I don\xe2\x80\x99t say but what there are plenty\r\nof pretty places and remarkable old things; but the trouble is that I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t seem to feel anywhere in tune. That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons why I\r\nsuppose I\xe2\x80\x99ve gained so little. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had the first sign of that\r\nlift I was led to expect.\xe2\x80\x9d With this he broke out more earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cLook\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x94I want to go back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis eyes were all attached to Strether\xe2\x80\x99s now, for he was one of the men\r\nwho fully face you when they talk of themselves. This enabled his\r\nfriend to look at him hard and immediately to appear to the highest\r\nadvantage in his eyes by doing so. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a genial thing to say to a\r\nfellow who has come out on purpose to meet you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing could have been finer, on this, than Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s sombre glow.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Have_ you come out on purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94very largely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought from the way you wrote there was something back of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cBack of my desire to be with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBack of your prostration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether, with a smile made more dim by a certain consciousness, shook\r\nhis head. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are all the causes of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd no particular cause that seemed most to drive you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur friend could at last conscientiously answer. \xe2\x80\x9cYes. One. There _is_\r\na matter that has had much to do with my coming out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaymarsh waited a little. \xe2\x80\x9cToo private to mention?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not too private\xe2\x80\x94for _you_. Only rather complicated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Waymarsh, who had waited again, \xe2\x80\x9cI _may_ lose my mind over\r\nhere, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know as I\xe2\x80\x99ve done so yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you shall have the whole thing. But not tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaymarsh seemed to sit stiffer and to hold his elbows tighter. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\r\nnot\xe2\x80\x94if I can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, my dear man, I _can!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen where\xe2\x80\x99s your prostration?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust in that\xe2\x80\x94that I can put in eight hours.\xe2\x80\x9d And Strether brought it\r\nout that if Waymarsh didn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cgain\xe2\x80\x9d it was because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to bed:\r\nthe result of which was, in its order, that, to do the latter justice,\r\nhe permitted his friend to insist on his really getting settled.\r\nStrether, with a kind coercive hand for it, assisted him to this\r\nconsummation, and again found his own part in their relation\r\nauspiciously enlarged by the smaller touches of lowering the lamp and\r\nseeing to a sufficiency of blanket. It somehow ministered for him to\r\nindulgence to feel Waymarsh, who looked unnaturally big and black in\r\nbed, as much tucked in as a patient in a hospital and, with his\r\ncovering up to his chin, as much simplified by it. He hovered in vague\r\npity, to be brief, while his companion challenged him out of the\r\nbedclothes. \xe2\x80\x9cIs she really after you? Is that what\xe2\x80\x99s behind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether felt an uneasiness at the direction taken by his companion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninsight, but he played a little at uncertainty. \xe2\x80\x9cBehind my coming out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBehind your prostration or whatever. It\xe2\x80\x99s generally felt, you know,\r\nthat she follows you up pretty close.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s candour was never very far off. \xe2\x80\x9cOh it has occurred to you\r\nthat I\xe2\x80\x99m literally running away from Mrs. Newsome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t _known_ but what you are. You\xe2\x80\x99re a very attractive\r\nman, Strether. You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen for yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Waymarsh \xe2\x80\x9cwhat that lady\r\ndownstairs makes of it. Unless indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d he rambled on with an effect\r\nbetween the ironic and the anxious, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s you who are after _her_. Is\r\nMrs. Newsome _over_ here?\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke as with a droll dread of her.\r\n\r\nIt made his friend\xe2\x80\x94though rather dimly\xe2\x80\x94smile. \xe2\x80\x9cDear no; she\xe2\x80\x99s safe,\r\nthank goodness\xe2\x80\x94as I think I more and more feel\xe2\x80\x94at home. She thought of\r\ncoming, but she gave it up. I\xe2\x80\x99ve come in a manner instead of her; and\r\ncome to that extent\xe2\x80\x94for you\xe2\x80\x99re right in your inference\xe2\x80\x94on her business.\r\nSo you see there _is_ plenty of connexion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaymarsh continued to see at least all there was. \xe2\x80\x9cInvolving\r\naccordingly the particular one I\xe2\x80\x99ve referred to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether took another turn about the room, giving a twitch to his\r\ncompanion\xe2\x80\x99s blanket and finally gaining the door. His feeling was that\r\nof a nurse who had earned personal rest by having made everything\r\nstraight. \xe2\x80\x9cInvolving more things than I can think of breaking ground on\r\nnow. But don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid\xe2\x80\x94you shall have them from me: you\xe2\x80\x99ll probably\r\nfind yourself having quite as much of them as you can do with. I\r\nshall\xe2\x80\x94if we keep together\xe2\x80\x94very much depend on your impression of some\r\nof them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s acknowledgement of this tribute was characteristically\r\nindirect. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean to say you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe we _will_ keep together?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only glance at the danger,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether paternally said, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause when\r\nI hear you wail to go back I seem to see you open up such possibilities\r\nof folly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaymarsh took it\xe2\x80\x94silent a little\xe2\x80\x94like a large snubbed child \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are\r\nyou going to do with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the very question Strether himself had put to Miss Gostrey, and\r\nhe wondered if he had sounded like that. But _he_ at least could be\r\nmore definite. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to take you right down to London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99ve been down to London!\xe2\x80\x9d Waymarsh more softly moaned. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve no\r\nuse, Strether, for anything down there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, good-humouredly, \xe2\x80\x9cI guess you\xe2\x80\x99ve some use for\r\n_me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go further yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Waymarsh sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cdo your damnedest! Only you _will_ tell me\r\nbefore you lead me on all the way\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur friend had again so lost himself, both for amusement and for\r\ncontrition, in the wonder of whether he had made, in his own challenge\r\nthat afternoon, such another figure, that he for an instant missed the\r\nthread. \xe2\x80\x9cTell you\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy what you\xe2\x80\x99ve got on hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy it\xe2\x80\x99s such a matter as that even if I\r\npositively wanted I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to keep it from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaymarsh gloomily gazed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that mean then but that your trip\r\nis just _for_ her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Mrs. Newsome? Oh it certainly is, as I say. Very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why do you also say it\xe2\x80\x99s for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether, in impatience, violently played with his latch. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s simple\r\nenough. It\xe2\x80\x99s for both of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaymarsh at last turned over with a groan. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, _I_ won\xe2\x80\x99t marry you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither, when it comes to that\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d But the visitor had already laughed\r\nand escaped.\r\n\r\n\r\n III\r\n\r\nHe had told Miss Gostrey he should probably take, for departure with\r\nWaymarsh, some afternoon train, and it thereupon in the morning\r\nappeared that this lady had made her own plan for an earlier one. She\r\nhad breakfasted when Strether came into the coffee-room; but, Waymarsh\r\nnot having yet emerged, he was in time to recall her to the terms of\r\ntheir understanding and to pronounce her discretion overdone. She was\r\nsurely not to break away at the very moment she had created a want. He\r\nhad met her as she rose from her little table in a window, where, with\r\nthe morning papers beside her, she reminded him, as he let her know, of\r\nMajor Pendennis breakfasting at his club\xe2\x80\x94a compliment of which she\r\nprofessed a deep appreciation; and he detained her as pleadingly as if\r\nhe had already\xe2\x80\x94and notably under pressure of the visions of the\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x94learned to be unable to do without her. She must teach him at all\r\nevents, before she went, to order breakfast as breakfast was ordered in\r\nEurope, and she must especially sustain him in the problem of ordering\r\nfor Waymarsh. The latter had laid upon his friend, by desperate sounds\r\nthrough the door of his room, dreadful divined responsibilities in\r\nrespect to beefsteak and oranges\xe2\x80\x94responsibilities which Miss Gostrey\r\ntook over with an alertness of action that matched her quick\r\nintelligence. She had before this weaned the expatriated from\r\ntraditions compared with which the matutinal beefsteak was but the\r\ncreature of an hour, and it was not for her, with some of her memories,\r\nto falter in the path though she freely enough declared, on reflexion,\r\nthat there was always in such cases a choice of opposed policies.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are times when to give them their head, you know\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had gone to wait together in the garden for the dressing of the\r\nmeal, and Strether found her more suggestive than ever \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs to bring about for them such a complexity of relations\xe2\x80\x94unless\r\nindeed we call it a simplicity!\xe2\x80\x94that the situation _has_ to wind itself\r\nup. They want to go back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you want them to go!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether gaily concluded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always want them to go, and I send them as fast as I can.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I know\xe2\x80\x94you take them to Liverpool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny port will serve in a storm. I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94with all my other functions\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nagent for repatriation. I want to re-people our stricken country. What\r\nwill become of it else? I want to discourage others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ordered English garden, in the freshness of the day, was delightful\r\nto Strether, who liked the sound, under his feet, of the tight fine\r\ngravel, packed with the chronic damp, and who had the idlest eye for\r\nthe deep smoothness of turf and the clean curves of paths. \xe2\x80\x9cOther\r\npeople?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOther countries. Other people\xe2\x80\x94yes. I want to encourage our own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cNot to come? Why then do you \xe2\x80\x98meet\xe2\x80\x99 them\xe2\x80\x94since it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to be to stop them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh that they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come is as yet too much to ask. What I attend\r\nto is that they come quickly and return still more so. I meet them to\r\nhelp it to be over as soon as possible, and though I don\xe2\x80\x99t stop them\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve my way of putting them through. That\xe2\x80\x99s my little system; and, if\r\nyou want to know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maria Gostrey, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s my real secret, my\r\ninnermost mission and use. I only seem, you see, to beguile and\r\napprove; but I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought it all out and I\xe2\x80\x99m working all the while\r\nunderground. I can\xe2\x80\x99t perhaps quite give you my formula, but I think\r\nthat practically I succeed. I send you back spent. So you stay back.\r\nPassed through my hands\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t turn up again?\xe2\x80\x9d The further she went the further he always\r\nsaw himself able to follow. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want your formula\xe2\x80\x94I feel quite\r\nenough, as I hinted yesterday, your abysses. Spent!\xe2\x80\x9d he echoed. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s how you\xe2\x80\x99re arranging so subtly to send me I thank you for the\r\nwarning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a minute, amid the pleasantness\xe2\x80\x94poetry in tariffed items, but all\r\nthe more, for guests already convicted, a challenge to consumption\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nsmiled at each other in confirmed fellowship. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you call it subtly?\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a plain poor tale. Besides, you\xe2\x80\x99re a special case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh special cases\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s weak!\xe2\x80\x9d She was weak enough, further still, to\r\ndefer her journey and agree to accompany the gentlemen on their own,\r\nmight a separate carriage mark her independence; though it was in spite\r\nof this to befall after luncheon that she went off alone and that, with\r\na tryst taken for a day of her company in London, they lingered another\r\nnight. She had, during the morning\xe2\x80\x94spent in a way that he was to\r\nremember later on as the very climax of his foretaste, as warm with\r\npresentiments, with what he would have called collapses\xe2\x80\x94had all sorts\r\nof things out with Strether; and among them the fact that though there\r\nwas never a moment of her life when she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cdue\xe2\x80\x9d somewhere, there\r\nwas yet scarce a perfidy to others of which she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t capable for his\r\nsake. She explained moreover that wherever she happened to be she found\r\na dropped thread to pick up, a ragged edge to repair, some familiar\r\nappetite in ambush, jumping out as she approached, yet appeasable with\r\na temporary biscuit. It became, on her taking the risk of the deviation\r\nimposed on him by her insidious arrangement of his morning meal, a\r\npoint of honour for her not to fail with Waymarsh of the larger success\r\ntoo; and her subsequent boast to Strether was that she had made their\r\nfriend fare\xe2\x80\x94and quite without his knowing what was the matter\xe2\x80\x94as Major\r\nPendennis would have fared at the Megatherium. She had made him\r\nbreakfast like a gentleman, and it was nothing, she forcibly asserted,\r\nto what she would yet make him do. She made him participate in the slow\r\nreiterated ramble with which, for Strether, the new day amply filled\r\nitself; and it was by her art that he somehow had the air, on the\r\nramparts and in the Rows, of carrying a point of his own.\r\n\r\nThe three strolled and stared and gossiped, or at least the two did;\r\nthe case really yielding for their comrade, if analysed, but the\r\nelement of stricken silence. This element indeed affected Strether as\r\ncharged with audible rumblings, but he was conscious of the care of\r\ntaking it explicitly as a sign of pleasant peace. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t appeal\r\ntoo much, for that provoked stiffness; yet he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too freely\r\ntacit, for that suggested giving up. Waymarsh himself adhered to an\r\nambiguous dumbness that might have represented either the growth of a\r\nperception or the despair of one; and at times and in places\xe2\x80\x94where the\r\nlow-browed galleries were darkest, the opposite gables queerest, the\r\nsolicitations of every kind densest\xe2\x80\x94the others caught him fixing hard\r\nsome object of minor interest, fixing even at moments nothing\r\ndiscernible, as if he were indulging it with a truce. When he met\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s eye on such occasions he looked guilty and furtive, fell the\r\nnext minute into some attitude of retractation. Our friend couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshow him the right things for fear of provoking some total\r\nrenouncement, and was tempted even to show him the wrong in order to\r\nmake him differ with triumph. There were moments when he himself felt\r\nshy of professing the full sweetness of the taste of leisure, and there\r\nwere others when he found himself feeling as if his passages of\r\ninterchange with the lady at his side might fall upon the third member\r\nof their party very much as Mr. Burchell, at Dr. Primrose\xe2\x80\x99s fireside,\r\nwas influenced by the high flights of the visitors from London. The\r\nsmallest things so arrested and amused him that he repeatedly almost\r\napologised\xe2\x80\x94brought up afresh in explanation his plea of a previous\r\ngrind. He was aware at the same time that his grind had been as nothing\r\nto Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s, and he repeatedly confessed that, to cover his\r\nfrivolity, he was doing his best for his previous virtue. Do what he\r\nmight, in any case, his previous virtue was still there, and it seemed\r\nfairly to stare at him out of the windows of shops that were not as the\r\nshops of Woollett, fairly to make him want things that he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what to do with. It was by the oddest, the least admissible of\r\nlaws demoralising him now; and the way it boldly took was to make him\r\nwant more wants. These first walks in Europe were in fact a kind of\r\nfinely lurid intimation of what one might find at the end of that\r\nprocess. Had he come back after long years, in something already so\r\nlike the evening of life, only to be exposed to it? It was at all\r\nevents over the shop-windows that he made, with Waymarsh, most free;\r\nthough it would have been easier had not the latter most sensibly\r\nyielded to the appeal of the merely useful trades. He pierced with his\r\nsombre detachment the plate-glass of ironmongers and saddlers, while\r\nStrether flaunted an affinity with the dealers in stamped letter-paper\r\nand in smart neckties. Strether was in fact recurrently shameless in\r\nthe presence of the tailors, though it was just over the heads of the\r\ntailors that his countryman most loftily looked. This gave Miss Gostrey\r\na grasped opportunity to back up Waymarsh at his expense. The weary\r\nlawyer\xe2\x80\x94it was unmistakeable\xe2\x80\x94had a conception of dress; but that, in\r\nview of some of the features of the effect produced, was just what made\r\nthe danger of insistence on it. Strether wondered if he by this time\r\nthought Miss Gostrey less fashionable or Lambert Strether more so; and\r\nit appeared probable that most of the remarks exchanged between this\r\nlatter pair about passers, figures, faces, personal types, exemplified\r\nin their degree the disposition to talk as \xe2\x80\x9csociety\xe2\x80\x9d talked.\r\n\r\nWas what was happening to himself then, was what already _had_\r\nhappened, really that a woman of fashion was floating him into society\r\nand that an old friend deserted on the brink was watching the force of\r\nthe current? When the woman of fashion permitted Strether\xe2\x80\x94as she\r\npermitted him at the most\xe2\x80\x94the purchase of a pair of gloves, the terms\r\nshe made about it, the prohibition of neckties and other items till she\r\nshould be able to guide him through the Burlington Arcade, were such as\r\nto fall upon a sensitive ear as a challenge to just imputations. Miss\r\nGostrey was such a woman of fashion as could make without a symptom of\r\nvulgar blinking an appointment for the Burlington Arcade. Mere\r\ndiscriminations about a pair of gloves could thus at any rate\r\nrepresent\xe2\x80\x94always for such sensitive ears as were in\r\nquestion\xe2\x80\x94possibilities of something that Strether could make a mark\r\nagainst only as the peril of apparent wantonness. He had quite the\r\nconsciousness of his new friend, for their companion, that he might\r\nhave had of a Jesuit in petticoats, a representative of the recruiting\r\ninterests of the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church, for\r\nWaymarsh\xe2\x80\x94that was to say the enemy, the monster of bulging eyes and\r\nfar-reaching quivering groping tentacles\xe2\x80\x94was exactly society, exactly\r\nthe multiplication of shibboleths, exactly the discrimination of types\r\nand tones, exactly the wicked old Rows of Chester, rank with feudalism;\r\nexactly in short Europe.\r\n\r\nThere was light for observation, however, in an incident that occurred\r\njust before they turned back to luncheon. Waymarsh had been for a\r\nquarter of an hour exceptionally mute and distant, and something, or\r\nother\xe2\x80\x94Strether was never to make out exactly what\xe2\x80\x94proved, as it were,\r\ntoo much for him after his comrades had stood for three minutes taking\r\nin, while they leaned on an old balustrade that guarded the edge of the\r\nRow, a particularly crooked and huddled street-view. \xe2\x80\x9cHe thinks us\r\nsophisticated, he thinks us worldly, he thinks us wicked, he thinks us\r\nall sorts of queer things,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether reflected; for wondrous were the\r\nvague quantities our friend had within a couple of short days acquired\r\nthe habit of conveniently and conclusively lumping together. There\r\nseemed moreover a direct connexion between some such inference and a\r\nsudden grim dash taken by Waymarsh to the opposite side. This movement\r\nwas startlingly sudden, and his companions at first supposed him to\r\nhave espied, to be pursuing, the glimpse of an acquaintance. They next\r\nmade out, however, that an open door had instantly received him, and\r\nthey then recognised him as engulfed in the establishment of a\r\njeweller, behind whose glittering front he was lost to view. The fact\r\nhad somehow the note of a demonstration, and it left each of the others\r\nto show a face almost of fear. But Miss Gostrey broke into a laugh.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9che can\xe2\x80\x99t stand it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut can\xe2\x80\x99t stand what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything. Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen how will that jeweller help him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether seemed to make it out, from their position, between the\r\ninterstices of arrayed watches, of close-hung dangling gewgaws. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh that\xe2\x80\x99s just what\xe2\x80\x94if he buys anything\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of: that I shall\r\nsee something rather dreadful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether studied the finer appearances. \xe2\x80\x9cHe may buy everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen don\xe2\x80\x99t you think we ought to follow him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for worlds. Besides we can\xe2\x80\x99t. We\xe2\x80\x99re paralysed. We exchange a long\r\nscared look, we publicly tremble. The thing is, you see, we \xe2\x80\x98realise.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHe has struck for freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wondered but she laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cAh what a price to pay! And I was\r\npreparing some for him so cheap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether went on, frankly amused now; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t call it that:\r\nthe kind of freedom you deal in is dear.\xe2\x80\x9d Then as to justify himself:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I not in _my_ way trying it? It\xe2\x80\x99s this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeing here, you mean, with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and talking to you as I do. I\xe2\x80\x99ve known you a few hours, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nknown _him_ all my life; so that if the ease I thus take with you about\r\nhim isn\xe2\x80\x99t magnificent\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and the thought of it held him a moment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhy\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s rather base.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s magnificent!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Gostrey to make an end of it. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\r\nshould hear,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cthe ease _I_ take\xe2\x80\x94and I above all intend to\r\ntake\xe2\x80\x94with Mr. Waymarsh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether thought. \xe2\x80\x9cAbout _me?_ Ah that\xe2\x80\x99s no equivalent. The equivalent\r\nwould be Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s himself serving me up\xe2\x80\x94his remorseless analysis of\r\nme. And he\xe2\x80\x99ll never do that\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he was sadly clear. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll never\r\nremorselessly analyse me.\xe2\x80\x9d He quite held her with the authority of\r\nthis. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll never say a word to you about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took it in; she did it justice; yet after an instant her reason,\r\nher restless irony, disposed of it. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course he won\xe2\x80\x99t. For what do\r\nyou take people, that they\xe2\x80\x99re able to say words about anything, able\r\nremorselessly to analyse? There are not many like you and me. It will\r\nbe only because he\xe2\x80\x99s too stupid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt stirred in her friend a sceptical echo which was at the same time\r\nthe protest of the faith of years. \xe2\x80\x9cWaymarsh stupid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompared with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether had still his eyes on the jeweller\xe2\x80\x99s front, and he waited a\r\nmoment to answer. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a success of a kind that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t approached.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean he has made money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe makes it\xe2\x80\x94to my belief. And I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cthough with a back\r\nquite as bent, have never made anything. I\xe2\x80\x99m a perfectly equipped\r\nfailure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe feared an instant she\xe2\x80\x99d ask him if he meant he was poor; and he was\r\nglad she didn\xe2\x80\x99t, for he really didn\xe2\x80\x99t know to what the truth on this\r\nunpleasant point mightn\xe2\x80\x99t have prompted her. She only, however,\r\nconfirmed his assertion. \xe2\x80\x9cThank goodness you\xe2\x80\x99re a failure\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s why I so\r\ndistinguish you! Anything else to-day is too hideous. Look about\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94look at the successes. Would you _be_ one, on your honour? Look,\r\nmoreover,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cat me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a little accordingly their eyes met. \xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether returned.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou too are out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe superiority you discern in me,\xe2\x80\x9d she concurred, \xe2\x80\x9cannounces my\r\nfutility. If you knew,\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cthe dreams of my youth! But our\r\nrealities are what has brought us together. We\xe2\x80\x99re beaten brothers in\r\narms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled at her kindly enough, but he shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nalter the fact that you\xe2\x80\x99re expensive. You\xe2\x80\x99ve cost me already\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he had hung fire. \xe2\x80\x9cCost you what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my past\xe2\x80\x94in one great lump. But no matter,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pay\r\nwith my last penny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer attention had unfortunately now been engaged by their comrade\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreturn, for Waymarsh met their view as he came out of his shop. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope\r\nhe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t paid,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwith _his_ last; though I\xe2\x80\x99m convinced he\r\nhas been splendid, and has been so for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh no\xe2\x80\x94not that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite as little.\xe2\x80\x9d Waymarsh was by this time near enough to show signs\r\nhis friend could read, though he seemed to look almost carefully at\r\nnothing in particular.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen for himself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor nobody. For nothing. For freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what has freedom to do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s answer was indirect. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be as good as you and me. But\r\ndifferent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had had time to take in their companion\xe2\x80\x99s face; and with it, as\r\nsuch things were easy for her, she took in all. \xe2\x80\x9cDifferent\xe2\x80\x94yes. But\r\nbetter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Waymarsh was sombre he was also indeed almost sublime. He told them\r\nnothing, left his absence unexplained, and though they were convinced\r\nhe had made some extraordinary purchase they were never to learn its\r\nnature. He only glowered grandly at the tops of the old gables. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe sacred rage,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether had had further time to say; and this sacred\r\nrage was to become between them, for convenient comprehension, the\r\ndescription of one of his periodical necessities. It was Strether who\r\neventually contended that it did make him better than they. But by that\r\ntime Miss Gostrey was convinced that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be better than\r\nStrether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook Second\r\n\r\n\r\n I\r\n\r\nThose occasions on which Strether was, in association with the exile\r\nfrom Milrose, to see the sacred rage glimmer through would doubtless\r\nhave their due periodicity; but our friend had meanwhile to find names\r\nfor many other matters. On no evening of his life perhaps, as he\r\nreflected, had he had to supply so many as on the third of his short\r\nstay in London; an evening spent by Miss Gostrey\xe2\x80\x99s side at one of the\r\ntheatres, to which he had found himself transported, without his own\r\nhand raised, on the mere expression of a conscientious wonder. She knew\r\nher theatre, she knew her play, as she had triumphantly known, three\r\ndays running, everything else, and the moment filled to the brim, for\r\nher companion, that apprehension of the interesting which, whether or\r\nno the interesting happened to filter through his guide, strained now\r\nto its limits his brief opportunity. Waymarsh hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come with them; he\r\nhad seen plays enough, he signified, before Strether had joined him\xe2\x80\x94an\r\naffirmation that had its full force when his friend ascertained by\r\nquestions that he had seen two and a circus. Questions as to what he\r\nhad seen had on him indeed an effect only less favourable than\r\nquestions as to what he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t. He liked the former to be\r\ndiscriminated; but how could it be done, Strether asked of their\r\nconstant counsellor, without discriminating the latter?\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey had dined with him at his hotel, face to face over a small\r\ntable on which the lighted candles had rose-coloured shades; and the\r\nrose-coloured shades and the small table and the soft fragrance of the\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x94had anything to his mere sense ever been so soft?\xe2\x80\x94were so many\r\ntouches in he scarce knew what positive high picture. He had been to\r\nthe theatre, even to the opera, in Boston, with Mrs. Newsome, more than\r\nonce acting as her only escort; but there had been no little confronted\r\ndinner, no pink lights, no whiff of vague sweetness, as a preliminary:\r\none of the results of which was that at present, mildly rueful, though\r\nwith a sharpish accent, he actually asked himself _why_ there hadn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nThere was much the same difference in his impression of the noticed\r\nstate of his companion, whose dress was \xe2\x80\x9ccut down,\xe2\x80\x9d as he believed the\r\nterm to be, in respect to shoulders and bosom, in a manner quite other\r\nthan Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s, and who wore round her throat a broad red velvet\r\nband with an antique jewel\xe2\x80\x94he was rather complacently sure it was\r\nantique\xe2\x80\x94attached to it in front. Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s dress was never in any\r\ndegree \xe2\x80\x9ccut down,\xe2\x80\x9d and she never wore round her throat a broad red\r\nvelvet band: if she had, moreover, would it ever have served so to\r\ncarry on and complicate, as he now almost felt, his vision?\r\n\r\nIt would have been absurd of him to trace into ramifications the effect\r\nof the ribbon from which Miss Gostrey\xe2\x80\x99s trinket depended, had he not\r\nfor the hour, at the best, been so given over to uncontrolled\r\nperceptions. What was it but an uncontrolled perception that his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s velvet band somehow added, in her appearance, to the value of\r\nevery other item\xe2\x80\x94to that of her smile and of the way she carried her\r\nhead, to that of her complexion, of her lips, her teeth, her eyes, her\r\nhair? What, certainly, had a man conscious of a man\xe2\x80\x99s work in the world\r\nto do with red velvet bands? He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t for anything have so exposed\r\nhimself as to tell Miss Gostrey how much he liked hers, yet he _had_\r\nnone the less not only caught himself in the act\xe2\x80\x94frivolous, no doubt,\r\nidiotic, and above all unexpected\xe2\x80\x94of liking it: he had in addition\r\ntaken it as a starting-point for fresh backward, fresh forward, fresh\r\nlateral flights. The manner in which Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s throat _was_\r\nencircled suddenly represented for him, in an alien order, almost as\r\nmany things as the manner in which Miss Gostrey\xe2\x80\x99s was. Mrs. Newsome\r\nwore, at operatic hours, a black silk dress\xe2\x80\x94very handsome, he knew it\r\nwas \xe2\x80\x9chandsome\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and an ornament that his memory was able further to\r\nidentify as a ruche. He had his association indeed with the ruche, but\r\nit was rather imperfectly romantic. He had once said to the wearer\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nit was as \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d a remark as he had ever made to her\xe2\x80\x94that she looked,\r\nwith her ruff and other matters, like Queen Elizabeth; and it had after\r\nthis in truth been his fancy that, as a consequence of that tenderness\r\nand an acceptance of the idea, the form of this special tribute to the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfrill\xe2\x80\x9d had grown slightly more marked. The connexion, as he sat there\r\nand let his imagination roam, was to strike him as vaguely pathetic;\r\nbut there it all was, and pathetic was doubtless in the conditions the\r\nbest thing it could possibly be. It had assuredly existed at any rate;\r\nfor it seemed now to come over him that no gentleman of his age at\r\nWoollett could ever, to a lady of Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s, which was not much\r\nless than his, have embarked on such a simile.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of things in fact now seemed to come over him, comparatively\r\nfew of which his chronicler can hope for space to mention. It came over\r\nhim for instance that Miss Gostrey looked perhaps like Mary Stuart:\r\nLambert Strether had a candour of fancy which could rest for an instant\r\ngratified in such an antithesis. It came over him that never before\xe2\x80\x94no,\r\nliterally never\xe2\x80\x94had a lady dined with him at a public place before\r\ngoing to the play. The publicity of the place was just, in the matter,\r\nfor Strether, the rare strange thing; it affected him almost as the\r\nachievement of privacy might have affected a man of a different\r\nexperience. He had married, in the far-away years, so young as to have\r\nmissed the time natural in Boston for taking girls to the Museum; and\r\nit was absolutely true of hint that\xe2\x80\x94even after the close of the period\r\nof conscious detachment occupying the centre of his life, the grey\r\nmiddle desert of the two deaths, that of his wife and that, ten years\r\nlater, of his boy\xe2\x80\x94he had never taken any one anywhere. It came over him\r\nin especial\xe2\x80\x94though the monition had, as happened, already sounded,\r\nfitfully gleamed, in other forms\xe2\x80\x94that the business he had come out on\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet been so brought home to him as by the sight of the people\r\nabout him. She gave him the impression, his friend, at first, more\r\nstraight than he got it for himself\xe2\x80\x94gave it simply by saying with\r\noff-hand illumination: \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, they\xe2\x80\x99re types!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but after he had taken\r\nit he made to the full his own use of it; both while he kept silence\r\nfor the four acts and while he talked in the intervals. It was an\r\nevening, it was a world of types, and this was a connexion above all in\r\nwhich the figures and faces in the stalls were interchangeable with\r\nthose on the stage.\r\n\r\nHe felt as if the play itself penetrated him with the naked elbow of\r\nhis neighbour, a great stripped handsome red-haired lady who conversed\r\nwith a gentleman on her other side in stray dissyllables which had for\r\nhis ear, in the oddest way in the world, so much sound that he wondered\r\nthey hadn\xe2\x80\x99t more sense; and he recognised by the same law, beyond the\r\nfootlights, what he was pleased to take for the very flush of English\r\nlife. He had distracted drops in which he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have said if it were\r\nactors or auditors who were most true, and the upshot of which, each\r\ntime, was the consciousness of new contacts. However he viewed his job\r\nit was \xe2\x80\x9ctypes\xe2\x80\x9d he should have to tackle. Those before him and around\r\nhim were not as the types of Woollett, where, for that matter, it had\r\nbegun to seem to him that there must only have been the male and the\r\nfemale. These made two exactly, even with the individual varieties.\r\nHere, on the other hand, apart from the personal and the sexual\r\nrange\xe2\x80\x94which might be greater or less\xe2\x80\x94a series of strong stamps had been\r\napplied, as it were, from without; stamps that his observation played\r\nwith as, before a glass case on a table, it might have passed from\r\nmedal to medal and from copper to gold. It befell that in the drama\r\nprecisely there was a bad woman in a yellow frock who made a pleasant\r\nweak good-looking young man in perpetual evening dress do the most\r\ndreadful things. Strether felt himself on the whole not afraid of the\r\nyellow frock, but he was vaguely anxious over a certain kindness into\r\nwhich he found himself drifting for its victim. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come out, he\r\nreminded himself, to be too kind, or indeed to be kind at all, to\r\nChadwick Newsome. Would Chad also be in perpetual evening dress? He\r\nsomehow rather hoped it\xe2\x80\x94it seemed so to add to _this_ young man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngeneral amenability; though he wondered too if, to fight him with his\r\nown weapons, he himself (a thought almost startling) would have\r\nlikewise to be. This young man furthermore would have been much more\r\neasy to handle\xe2\x80\x94at least for _him_\xe2\x80\x94than appeared probable in respect to\r\nChad.\r\n\r\nIt came up for him with Miss Gostrey that there were things of which\r\nshe would really perhaps after all have heard, and she admitted when a\r\nlittle pressed that she was never quite sure of what she heard as\r\ndistinguished from things such as, on occasions like the present, she\r\nonly extravagantly guessed. \xe2\x80\x9cI seem with this freedom, you see, to have\r\nguessed Mr. Chad. He\xe2\x80\x99s a young man on whose head high hopes are placed\r\nat Woollett; a young man a wicked woman has got hold of and whom his\r\nfamily over there have sent you out to rescue. You\xe2\x80\x99ve accepted the\r\nmission of separating him from the wicked woman. Are you quite sure\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s very bad for him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething in his manner showed it as quite pulling him up. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course\r\nwe are. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t _you_ be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. One never does\xe2\x80\x94does one?\xe2\x80\x94beforehand. One can only\r\njudge on the facts. Yours are quite new to me; I\xe2\x80\x99m really not in the\r\nleast, as you see, in possession of them: so it will be awfully\r\ninteresting to have them from you. If you\xe2\x80\x99re satisfied, that\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s required. I mean if you\xe2\x80\x99re sure you _are_ sure: sure it won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat he should lead such a life? Rather!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, you see, about his life; you\xe2\x80\x99ve not told me about\r\nhis life. She may be charming\xe2\x80\x94his life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharming?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Strether stared before him. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s base, venal\xe2\x80\x94out of the\r\nstreets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. And _he_\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChad, wretched boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf what type and temper is he?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on as Strether had lapsed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94the obstinate.\xe2\x80\x9d It was as if for a moment he had been going to\r\nsay more and had then controlled himself.\r\n\r\nThat was scarce what she wished. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you like him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time he was prompt. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. How _can_ I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean because of your being so saddled with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of his mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether after a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has\r\ndarkened her admirable life.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke with austerity. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has worried\r\nher half to death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh that\xe2\x80\x99s of course odious.\xe2\x80\x9d She had a pause as if for renewed\r\nemphasis of this truth, but it ended on another note. \xe2\x80\x9cIs her life very\r\nadmirable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExtraordinarily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was so much in the tone that Miss Gostrey had to devote another\r\npause to the appreciation of it. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd has he only _her?_ I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean\r\nthe bad woman in Paris,\xe2\x80\x9d she quickly added\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfor I assure you I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even at the best be disposed to allow him more than one. But\r\nhas he only his mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has also a sister, older than himself and married; and they\xe2\x80\x99re both\r\nremarkably fine women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery handsome, you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis promptitude\xe2\x80\x94almost, as he might have thought, this precipitation,\r\ngave him a brief drop; but he came up again. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Newsome, I think, is\r\nhandsome, though she\xe2\x80\x99s not of course, with a son of twenty-eight and a\r\ndaughter of thirty, in her very first youth. She married, however,\r\nextremely young.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is wonderful,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Gostrey asked, \xe2\x80\x9cfor her age?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether seemed to feel with a certain disquiet the pressure of it. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t say she\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful. Or rather,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on the next moment, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndo say it. It\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what she _is_\xe2\x80\x94wonderful. But I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking\r\nof her appearance,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cstriking as that doubtless is. I was\r\nthinking\xe2\x80\x94well, of many other things.\xe2\x80\x9d He seemed to look at these as if\r\nto mention some of them; then took, pulling himself up, another turn.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout Mrs. Pocock people may differ.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the daughter\xe2\x80\x99s name\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Pocock\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the daughter\xe2\x80\x99s name,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether sturdily confessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd people may differ, you mean, about _her_ beauty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _you_ admire her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave his friend a glance as to show how he could bear this \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nperhaps a little afraid of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Gostrey, \xe2\x80\x9cI see her from here! You may say then I see\r\nvery fast and very far, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve already shown you I do. The young man\r\nand the two ladies,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9care at any rate all the family?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite all. His father has been dead ten years, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no brother,\r\nnor any other sister. They\xe2\x80\x99d do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9canything in the world\r\nfor him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99d do anything in the world for _them?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shifted again; she had made it perhaps just a shade too affirmative\r\nfor his nerves. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I don\xe2\x80\x99t know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d do at any rate this, and the \xe2\x80\x98anything\xe2\x80\x99 they\xe2\x80\x99d do is represented\r\nby their _making_ you do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come\xe2\x80\x94either of them. They\xe2\x80\x99re very busy people\r\nand Mrs. Newsome in particular has a large full life. She\xe2\x80\x99s moreover\r\nhighly nervous\xe2\x80\x94and not at all strong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean she\xe2\x80\x99s an American invalid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe carefully distinguished. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing she likes less than to be\r\ncalled one, but she would consent to be one of those things, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cif it were the only way to be the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsent to be an American in order to be an invalid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cthe other way round. She\xe2\x80\x99s at any rate delicate\r\nsensitive high-strung. She puts so much of herself into everything\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAh Maria knew these things! \xe2\x80\x9cThat she has nothing left for anything\r\nelse? Of course she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t. To whom do you say it? High-strung? Don\xe2\x80\x99t I\r\nspend my life, for them, jamming down the pedal? I see moreover how it\r\nhas told on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether took this more lightly. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I jam down the pedal too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she lucidly returned, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must from this moment bear on it\r\ntogether with all our might.\xe2\x80\x9d And she forged ahead. \xe2\x80\x9cHave they money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it was as if, while her energetic image still held him, her enquiry\r\nfell short. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Newsome,\xe2\x80\x9d he wished further to explain, \xe2\x80\x9chasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmoreover your courage on the question of contact. If she had come it\r\nwould have been to see the person herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe woman? Ah but that\xe2\x80\x99s courage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s exaltation, which is a very different thing. Courage,\xe2\x80\x9d he,\r\nhowever, accommodatingly threw out, \xe2\x80\x9cis what _you_ have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou say that only to patch me up\xe2\x80\x94to cover the\r\nnudity of my want of exaltation. I\xe2\x80\x99ve neither the one nor the other.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve mere battered indifference. I see that what you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss\r\nGostrey pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cis that if your friend _had_ come she would take\r\ngreat views, and the great views, to put it simply, would be too much\r\nfor her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether looked amused at her notion of the simple, but he adopted her\r\nformula. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything\xe2\x80\x99s too much for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh then such a service as this of yours\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs more for her than anything else? Yes\xe2\x80\x94far more. But so long as it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t too much for _me_\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer condition doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter? Surely not; we leave her condition out;\r\nwe take it, that is, for granted. I see it, her condition, as behind\r\nand beneath you; yet at the same time I see it as bearing you up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh it does bear me up!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then as yours bears _me_ nothing more\xe2\x80\x99s needed.\xe2\x80\x9d With which she\r\nput again her question. \xe2\x80\x9cHas Mrs. Newsome money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time he heeded. \xe2\x80\x9cOh plenty. That\xe2\x80\x99s the root of the evil. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmoney, to very large amounts, in the concern. Chad has had the free use\r\nof a great deal. But if he\xe2\x80\x99ll pull himself together and come home, all\r\nthe same, he\xe2\x80\x99ll find his account in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had listened with all her interest. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I hope to goodness you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfind yours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll take up his definite material reward,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether without\r\nacknowledgement of this. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s at the parting of the ways. He can come\r\ninto the business now\xe2\x80\x94he can\xe2\x80\x99t come later.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there a business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, yes\xe2\x80\x94a big brave bouncing business. A roaring trade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great shop?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94a workshop; a great production, a great industry. The concern\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nmanufacture\xe2\x80\x94and a manufacture that, if it\xe2\x80\x99s only properly looked after,\r\nmay well be on the way to become a monopoly. It\xe2\x80\x99s a little thing they\r\nmake\xe2\x80\x94make better, it appears, than other people can, or than other\r\npeople, at any rate, do. Mr. Newsome, being a man of ideas, at least in\r\nthat particular line,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether explained, \xe2\x80\x9cput them on it with great\r\neffect, and gave the place altogether, in his time, an immense lift.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a place in itself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, quite a number of buildings; almost a little industrial colony.\r\nBut above all it\xe2\x80\x99s a thing. The article produced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what _is_ the article produced?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether looked about him as in slight reluctance to say; then the\r\ncurtain, which he saw about to rise, came to his aid. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you\r\nnext time.\xe2\x80\x9d But when the next time came he only said he\xe2\x80\x99d tell her\r\nlater on\xe2\x80\x94after they should have left the theatre; for she had\r\nimmediately reverted to their topic, and even for himself the picture\r\nof the stage was now overlaid with another image. His postponements,\r\nhowever, made her wonder\xe2\x80\x94wonder if the article referred to were\r\nanything bad. And she explained that she meant improper or ridiculous\r\nor wrong. But Strether, so far as that went, could satisfy her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnmentionable? Oh no, we constantly talk of it; we are quite familiar\r\nand brazen about it. Only, as a small, trivial, rather ridiculous\r\nobject of the commonest domestic use, it\xe2\x80\x99s just wanting in\xe2\x80\x94what shall I\r\nsay? Well, dignity, or the least approach to distinction. Right here\r\ntherefore, with everything about us so grand\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d In short he shrank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a false note?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSadly. It\xe2\x80\x99s vulgar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely not vulgarer than this.\xe2\x80\x9d Then on his wondering as she\r\nherself had done: \xe2\x80\x9cThan everything about us.\xe2\x80\x9d She seemed a trifle\r\nirritated. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you take this for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy for\xe2\x80\x94comparatively\xe2\x80\x94divine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis dreadful London theatre? It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible, if you really want to\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh then,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cI _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ really want to know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt made between them a pause, which she, however, still fascinated by\r\nthe mystery of the production at Woollett, presently broke. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Rather\r\nridiculous\xe2\x80\x99? Clothes-pins? Saleratus? Shoe-polish?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt brought him round. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t even \xe2\x80\x98burn.\xe2\x80\x99 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think, you\r\nknow, you\xe2\x80\x99ll guess it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow then can I judge how vulgar it is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll judge when I do tell you\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he persuaded her to patience. But\r\nit may even now frankly be mentioned that he in the sequel never _was_\r\nto tell her. He actually never did so, and it moreover oddly occurred\r\nthat by the law, within her, of the incalculable, her desire for the\r\ninformation dropped and her attitude to the question converted itself\r\ninto a positive cultivation of ignorance. In ignorance she could humour\r\nher fancy, and that proved a useful freedom. She could treat the little\r\nnameless object as indeed unnameable\xe2\x80\x94she could make their abstention\r\nenormously definite. There might indeed have been for Strether the\r\nportent of this in what she next said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it perhaps then because it\xe2\x80\x99s so bad\xe2\x80\x94because your industry as you\r\ncall it, _is_ so vulgar\xe2\x80\x94that Mr. Chad won\xe2\x80\x99t come back? Does he feel the\r\ntaint? Is he staying away not to be mixed up in it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cit wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t appear\xe2\x80\x94would it?\xe2\x80\x94that he feels\r\n\xe2\x80\x98taints\xe2\x80\x99! He\xe2\x80\x99s glad enough of the money from it, and the money\xe2\x80\x99s his\r\nwhole basis. There\xe2\x80\x99s appreciation in that\xe2\x80\x94I mean as to the allowance\r\nhis mother has hitherto made him. She has of course the resource of\r\ncutting this allowance off; but even then he has unfortunately, and on\r\nno small scale, his independent supply\xe2\x80\x94money left him by his\r\ngrandfather, her own father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the fact you mention then,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Gostrey asked, \xe2\x80\x9cmake it just\r\nmore easy for him to be particular? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t he conceivable as fastidious\r\nabout the source\xe2\x80\x94the apparent and public source\xe2\x80\x94of his income?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether was able quite good-humouredly to entertain the proposition.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe source of his grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s wealth\xe2\x80\x94and thereby of his own share in\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94was not particularly noble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what source was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether cast about. \xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94practices.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn business? Infamies? He was an old swindler?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with more emphasis than spirit, \xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t describe _him_\r\nnor narrate his exploits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, what abysses! And the late Mr. Newsome then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what about him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas he like the grandfather?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94he was on the other side of the house. And he was different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey kept it up. \xe2\x80\x9cBetter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer friend for a moment hung fire. \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer comment on his hesitation was scarce the less marked for being\r\nmute. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you. _Now_ don\xe2\x80\x99t you see,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy the boy\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t come home? He\xe2\x80\x99s drowning his shame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis shame? What shame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shame? Comment donc? _The_ shame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where and when,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether asked, \xe2\x80\x9cis \xe2\x80\x98_the_ shame\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94where is any\r\nshame\xe2\x80\x94to-day? The men I speak of\xe2\x80\x94they did as every one does; and\r\n(besides being ancient history) it was all a matter of appreciation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe showed how she understood. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Newsome has appreciated?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak for _her!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the midst of such doings\xe2\x80\x94and, as I understand you, profiting by\r\nthem, she at least has remained exquisite?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk of her!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought she was just what you _could_ talk of. You _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ trust\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Gostrey after a moment declared.\r\n\r\nIt had its effect. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, her money is spent, her life conceived and\r\ncarried on with a large beneficence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of expiation of wrongs? Gracious,\xe2\x80\x9d she added before he\r\ncould speak, \xe2\x80\x9chow intensely you make me see her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you see her,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether dropped, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s all that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe really seemed to have her. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel that. She _is_, in spite of\r\neverything, handsome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis at least enlivened him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by everything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I mean _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d With which she had one of her swift changes of\r\nground. \xe2\x80\x9cYou say the concern needs looking after; but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Mrs.\r\nNewsome look after it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo far as possible. She\xe2\x80\x99s wonderfully able, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not her affair,\r\nand her life\xe2\x80\x99s a good deal overcharged. She has many, many things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you also?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve many too, if you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. But what I mean is,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Gostrey amended, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you also look\r\nafter the business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t touch the business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly everything else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes\xe2\x80\x94some things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for instance\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether obligingly thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, the Review.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Review?\xe2\x80\x94you have a Review?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. Woollett has a Review\xe2\x80\x94which Mrs. Newsome, for the most\r\npart, magnificently pays for and which I, not at all magnificently,\r\nedit. My name\xe2\x80\x99s on the cover,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m really rather\r\ndisappointed and hurt that you seem never to have heard of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe neglected for a moment this grievance. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what kind of a Review\r\nis it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis serenity was now completely restored. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s green.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean in political colour as they say here\xe2\x80\x94in thought?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I mean the cover\xe2\x80\x99s green\xe2\x80\x94of the most lovely shade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd with Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s name on it too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited a little. \xe2\x80\x9cOh as for that you must judge if she peeps out.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s behind the whole thing; but she\xe2\x80\x99s of a delicacy and a\r\ndiscretion\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey took it all. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure. She _would_ be. I don\xe2\x80\x99t underrate\r\nher. She must be rather a swell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, she\xe2\x80\x99s rather a swell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Woollett swell\xe2\x80\x94_bon!_ I like the idea of a Woollett swell. And you\r\nmust be rather one too, to be so mixed up with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s not the way it works.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she had already taken him up. \xe2\x80\x9cThe way it works\xe2\x80\x94you needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x94is of course that you efface yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith my name on the cover?\xe2\x80\x9d he lucidly objected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but you don\xe2\x80\x99t put it on for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I do put it on for. It\xe2\x80\x99s exactly\r\nthe thing that I\xe2\x80\x99m reduced to doing for myself. It seems to rescue a\r\nlittle, you see, from the wreck of hopes and ambitions, the refuse-heap\r\nof disappointments and failures, my one presentable little scrap of an\r\nidentity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn this she looked at him as to say many things, but what she at last\r\nsimply said was: \xe2\x80\x9cShe likes to see it there. You\xe2\x80\x99re the bigger swell of\r\nthe two,\xe2\x80\x9d she immediately continued, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause you think you\xe2\x80\x99re not one.\r\nShe thinks she _is_ one. However,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Gostrey added, \xe2\x80\x9cshe thinks\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re one too. You\xe2\x80\x99re at all events the biggest she can get hold of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe embroidered, she abounded. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say it to interfere between\r\nyou, but on the day she gets hold of a bigger one\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether had\r\nthrown back his head as in silent mirth over something that struck him\r\nin her audacity or felicity, and her flight meanwhile was already\r\nhigher. \xe2\x80\x9cTherefore close with her\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClose with her?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked as she seemed to hang poised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore you lose your chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met over it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by closing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do I mean by your chance? I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you when you tell me all\r\nthe things _you_ don\xe2\x80\x99t. Is it her _greatest_ fad?\xe2\x80\x9d she briskly pursued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Review?\xe2\x80\x9d He seemed to wonder how he could best describe it. This\r\nresulted however but in a sketch. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s her tribute to the ideal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. You go in for tremendous things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe go in for the unpopular side\xe2\x80\x94that is so far as we dare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how far _do_ you dare?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she very far. I much less. I don\xe2\x80\x99t begin to have her faith. She\r\nprovides,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cthree fourths of that. And she provides, as\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve confided to you, _all_ the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt evoked somehow a vision of gold that held for a little Miss\r\nGostrey\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and she looked as if she heard the bright dollars\r\nshovelled in. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope then you make a good thing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _never_ made a good thing!\xe2\x80\x9d he at once returned.\r\n\r\nShe just waited. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you call it a good thing to be loved?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh we\xe2\x80\x99re not loved. We\xe2\x80\x99re not even hated. We\xe2\x80\x99re only just sweetly\r\nignored.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had another pause. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t trust me!\xe2\x80\x9d she once more repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t I when I lift the last veil?\xe2\x80\x94tell you the very secret of the\r\nprison-house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain she met his eyes, but to the result that after an instant her own\r\nturned away with impatience. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t sell? Oh I\xe2\x80\x99m glad of _that!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAfter which however, and before he could protest, she was off again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s just a _moral_ swell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe accepted gaily enough the definition. \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I really think that\r\ndescribes her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it had for his friend the oddest connexion. \xe2\x80\x9cHow does she do her\r\nhair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed out. \xe2\x80\x9cBeautifully!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me. However, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter\xe2\x80\x94I know. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntremendously neat\xe2\x80\x94a real reproach; quite remarkably thick and without,\r\nas yet, a single strand of white. There!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe blushed for her realism, but gaped at her truth. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re the very\r\ndeuce.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else _should_ I be? It was as the very deuce I pounced on you.\r\nBut don\xe2\x80\x99t let it trouble you, for everything but the very deuce\xe2\x80\x94at our\r\nage\xe2\x80\x94is a bore and a delusion, and even he himself, after all, but half\r\na joy.\xe2\x80\x9d With which, on a single sweep of her wing, she resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nassist her to expiate\xe2\x80\x94which is rather hard when you\xe2\x80\x99ve yourself not\r\nsinned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s she who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t sinned,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve sinned the most.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Gostrey cynically laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a picture of _her!_ Have\r\nyou robbed the widow and the orphan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve sinned enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough for whom? Enough for what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to be where I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you!\xe2\x80\x9d They were disturbed at this moment by the passage between\r\ntheir knees and the back of the seats before them of a gentleman who\r\nhad been absent during a part of the performance and who now returned\r\nfor the close; but the interruption left Miss Gostrey time, before the\r\nsubsequent hush, to express as a sharp finality her sense of the moral\r\nof all their talk. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew you had something up your sleeve!\xe2\x80\x9d This\r\nfinality, however, left them in its turn, at the end of the play, as\r\ndisposed to hang back as if they had still much to say; so that they\r\neasily agreed to let every one go before them\xe2\x80\x94they found an interest in\r\nwaiting. They made out from the lobby that the night had turned to\r\nrain; yet Miss Gostrey let her friend know that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to see her\r\nhome. He was simply to put her, by herself, into a four-wheeler; she\r\nliked so in London, of wet nights after wild pleasures, thinking things\r\nover, on the return, in lonely four-wheelers. This was her great time,\r\nshe intimated, for pulling herself together. The delays caused by the\r\nweather, the struggle for vehicles at the door, gave them occasion to\r\nsubside on a divan at the back of the vestibule and just beyond the\r\nreach of the fresh damp gusts from the street. Here Strether\xe2\x80\x99s comrade\r\nresumed that free handling of the subject to which his own imagination\r\nof it already owed so much. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes your young friend in Paris like you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt had almost, after the interval, startled him. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I hope not! Why\r\n_should_ he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Gostrey asked. \xe2\x80\x9cThat you\xe2\x80\x99re coming down on him\r\nneed have nothing to do with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see more in it,\xe2\x80\x9d he presently returned, \xe2\x80\x9cthan I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I see _you_ in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then you see more in \xe2\x80\x98me\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThan you see in yourself? Very likely. That\xe2\x80\x99s always one\xe2\x80\x99s right. What\r\nI was thinking of,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained, \xe2\x80\x9cis the possible particular effect\r\non him of his _milieu_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh his _milieu_\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether really felt he could imagine it better now\r\nthan three hours before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean it can only have been so lowering?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy that\xe2\x80\x99s my very starting-point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but you start so far back. What do his letters say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. He practically ignores us\xe2\x80\x94or spares us. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t write.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. But there are all the same,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9ctwo quite distinct\r\nthings that\xe2\x80\x94given the wonderful place he\xe2\x80\x99s in\xe2\x80\x94may have happened to him.\r\nOne is that he may have got brutalised. The other is that he may have\r\ngot refined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether stared\xe2\x80\x94this _was_ a novelty. \xe2\x80\x9cRefined?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cthere _are_ refinements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe way of it made him, after looking at her, break into a laugh.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ have them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs one of the signs,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued in the same tone, \xe2\x80\x9cthey constitute\r\nperhaps the worst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thought it over and his gravity returned. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it a refinement not to\r\nanswer his mother\xe2\x80\x99s letters?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe appeared to have a scruple, but she brought it out. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I should\r\nsay the greatest of all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9c_I\xe2\x80\x99m_ quite content to let it, as one of the\r\nsigns, pass for the worst that I know he believes he can do what he\r\nlikes with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis appeared to strike her. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it. I feel it in my bones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFeel he _can_ do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFeel that he believes he can. It may come to the same thing!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\nShe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, however, have this. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing for you will ever come to\r\nthe same thing as anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d And she understood what she meant, it\r\nseemed, sufficiently to go straight on. \xe2\x80\x9cYou say that if he does break\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll come in for things at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite positively. He\xe2\x80\x99ll come in for a particular chance\xe2\x80\x94a chance that\r\nany properly constituted young man would jump at. The business has so\r\ndeveloped that an opening scarcely apparent three years ago, but which\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s will took account of as in certain conditions possible and\r\nwhich, under that will, attaches to Chad\xe2\x80\x99s availing himself of it a\r\nlarge contingent advantage\xe2\x80\x94this opening, the conditions having come\r\nabout, now simply awaits him. His mother has kept it for him, holding\r\nout against strong pressure, till the last possible moment. It\r\nrequires, naturally, as it carries with it a handsome \xe2\x80\x98part,\xe2\x80\x99 a large\r\nshare in profits, his being on the spot and making a big effort for a\r\nbig result. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean by his chance. If he misses it he comes\r\nin, as you say, for nothing. And to see that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t miss it is, in\r\na word, what I\xe2\x80\x99ve come out for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe let it all sink in. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you\xe2\x80\x99ve come out for then is simply to\r\nrender him an immense service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, poor Strether was willing to take it so. \xe2\x80\x9cAh if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe stands, as they say, if you succeed with him, to gain\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh a lot of advantages.\xe2\x80\x9d Strether had them clearly at his fingers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy which you mean of course a lot of money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, not only. I\xe2\x80\x99m acting with a sense for him of other things too.\r\nConsideration and comfort and security\xe2\x80\x94the general safety of being\r\nanchored by a strong chain. He wants, as I see him, to be protected.\r\nProtected I mean from life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh voil\xc3\xa0!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94her thought fitted with a click. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom life. What you\r\n_really_ want to get him home for is to marry him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s about the size of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s rudimentary. But to any one in\r\nparticular?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled at this, looking a little more conscious. \xe2\x80\x9cYou get everything\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment again their eyes met. \xe2\x80\x9cYou put everything in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe acknowledged the tribute by telling her. \xe2\x80\x9cTo Mamie Pocock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wondered; then gravely, even exquisitely, as if to make the oddity\r\nalso fit: \xe2\x80\x9cHis own niece?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you must yourself find a name for the relation. His\r\nbrother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s sister. Mrs. Jim\xe2\x80\x99s sister-in-law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed to have on Miss Gostrey a certain hardening effect. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd who\r\nin the world\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs. Jim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChad\xe2\x80\x99s sister\xe2\x80\x94who was Sarah Newsome. She\xe2\x80\x99s married\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t I mention\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x94to Jim Pocock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d she tacitly replied; but he had mentioned things\xe2\x80\x94! Then,\r\nhowever, with all the sound it could have, \xe2\x80\x9cWho in the world\xe2\x80\x99s Jim\r\nPocock?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy Sally\xe2\x80\x99s husband. That\xe2\x80\x99s the only way we distinguish people at\r\nWoollett,\xe2\x80\x9d he good-humoredly explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is it a great distinction\xe2\x80\x94being Sally\xe2\x80\x99s husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe considered. \xe2\x80\x9cI think there can be scarcely a greater\xe2\x80\x94unless it may\r\nbecome one, in the future, to be Chad\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen how do they distinguish _you?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey _don\xe2\x80\x99t_\xe2\x80\x94except, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you, by the green cover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more their eyes met on it, and she held him an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cThe green\r\ncover won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94nor will _any_ cover\xe2\x80\x94avail you with _me_. You\xe2\x80\x99re of a depth\r\nof duplicity!\xe2\x80\x9d Still, she could in her own large grasp of the real\r\ncondone it. \xe2\x80\x9cIs Mamie a great _parti?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh the greatest we have\xe2\x80\x94our prettiest brightest girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey seemed to fix the poor child. \xe2\x80\x9cI know what they _can_ be.\r\nAnd with money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot perhaps with a great deal of that\xe2\x80\x94but with so much of everything\r\nelse that we don\xe2\x80\x99t miss it. We _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ miss money much, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nStrether added, \xe2\x80\x9cin general, in America, in pretty girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she conceded; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I know also what you do sometimes miss. And do\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cyourself admire her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a question, he indicated, that there might be several ways of\r\ntaking; but he decided after an instant for the humorous. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I\r\nsufficiently showed you how I admire _any_ pretty girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer interest in his problem was by this time such that it scarce left\r\nher freedom, and she kept close to the facts. \xe2\x80\x9cI supposed that at\r\nWoollett you wanted them\xe2\x80\x94what shall I call it?\xe2\x80\x94blameless. I mean your\r\nyoung men for your pretty girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo did I!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether confessed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you strike there a curious\r\nfact\xe2\x80\x94the fact that Woollett too accommodates itself to the spirit of\r\nthe age and the increasing mildness of manners. Everything changes, and\r\nI hold that our situation precisely marks a date. We _should_ prefer\r\nthem blameless, but we have to make the best of them as we find them.\r\nSince the spirit of the age and the increasing mildness send them so\r\nmuch more to Paris\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve to take them back as they come. When they _do_ come. _Bon!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nOnce more she embraced it all, but she had a moment of thought. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor\r\nChad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether cheerfully \xe2\x80\x9cMamie will save him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was looking away, still in her vision, and she spoke with\r\nimpatience and almost as if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t understood her. \xe2\x80\x9c_You\xe2\x80\x99ll_ save\r\nhim. That\xe2\x80\x99s who\xe2\x80\x99ll save him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh but with Mamie\xe2\x80\x99s aid. Unless indeed you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\r\nshall effect so much more with yours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt made her at last again look at him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll do more\xe2\x80\x94as you\xe2\x80\x99re so\r\nmuch better\xe2\x80\x94than all of us put together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99m only better since I\xe2\x80\x99ve known _you!_\xe2\x80\x9d Strether bravely\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nThe depletion of the place, the shrinkage of the crowd and now\r\ncomparatively quiet withdrawal of its last elements had already brought\r\nthem nearer the door and put them in relation with a messenger of whom\r\nhe bespoke Miss Gostrey\xe2\x80\x99s cab. But this left them a few minutes more,\r\nwhich she was clearly in no mood not to use. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to me of\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x94by your success\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Chad stands to gain. But you\xe2\x80\x99ve not spoken to\r\nme of what you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing more to gain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether very simply.\r\n\r\nShe took it as even quite too simple. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean you\xe2\x80\x99ve got it all\r\n\xe2\x80\x98down\xe2\x80\x99? You\xe2\x80\x99ve been paid in advance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about payment!\xe2\x80\x9d he groaned.\r\n\r\nSomething in the tone of it pulled her up, but as their messenger still\r\ndelayed she had another chance and she put it in another way. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94by\r\nfailure\xe2\x80\x94do you stand to lose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe still, however, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have it. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, and on\r\nthe messenger\xe2\x80\x99s at this instant reappearing he was able to sink the\r\nsubject in their responsive advance. When, a few steps up the street,\r\nunder a lamp, he had put her into her four-wheeler and she had asked\r\nhim if the man had called for him no second conveyance, he replied\r\nbefore the door was closed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t take me with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I shall walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the rain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like the rain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe kept him a moment, while his hand was on the door, by not\r\nanswering; after which she answered by repeating her question. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do\r\nyou stand to lose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhy the question now affected him as other he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have said; he\r\ncould only this time meet it otherwise. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I thought. Then you shall succeed. And to that end I\xe2\x80\x99m yours\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, dear lady!\xe2\x80\x9d he kindly breathed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill death!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maria Gostrey. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n II\r\n\r\nStrether called, his second morning in Paris, on the bankers of the Rue\r\nScribe to whom his letter of credit was addressed, and he made this\r\nvisit attended by Waymarsh, in whose company he had crossed from London\r\ntwo days before. They had hastened to the Rue Scribe on the morrow of\r\ntheir arrival, but Strether had not then found the letters the hope of\r\nwhich prompted this errand. He had had as yet none at all; hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexpected them in London, but had counted on several in Paris, and,\r\ndisconcerted now, had presently strolled back to the Boulevard with a\r\nsense of injury that he felt himself taking for as good a start as any\r\nother. It would serve, this spur to his spirit, he reflected, as,\r\npausing at the top of the street, he looked up and down the great\r\nforeign avenue, it would serve to begin business with. His idea was to\r\nbegin business immediately, and it did much for him the rest of his day\r\nthat the beginning of business awaited him. He did little else till\r\nnight but ask himself what he should do if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t fortunately had so\r\nmuch to do; but he put himself the question in many different\r\nsituations and connexions. What carried him hither and yon was an\r\nadmirable theory that nothing he could do wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in some manner\r\nrelated to what he fundamentally had on hand, or _would_ be\xe2\x80\x94should he\r\nhappen to have a scruple\xe2\x80\x94wasted for it. He did happen to have a\r\nscruple\xe2\x80\x94a scruple about taking no definite step till he should get\r\nletters; but this reasoning carried it off. A single day to feel his\r\nfeet\xe2\x80\x94he had felt them as yet only at Chester and in London\xe2\x80\x94was he could\r\nconsider, none too much; and having, as he had often privately\r\nexpressed it, Paris to reckon with, he threw these hours of freshness\r\nconsciously into the reckoning. They made it continually greater, but\r\nthat was what it had best be if it was to be anything at all, and he\r\ngave himself up till far into the evening, at the theatre and on the\r\nreturn, after the theatre, along the bright congested Boulevard, to\r\nfeeling it grow. Waymarsh had accompanied him this time to the play,\r\nand the two men had walked together, as a first stage, from the Gymnase\r\nto the Caf\xc3\xa9 Riche, into the crowded \xe2\x80\x9cterrace\xe2\x80\x9d of which\r\nestablishment\xe2\x80\x94the night, or rather the morning, for midnight had\r\nstruck, being bland and populous\xe2\x80\x94they had wedged themselves for\r\nrefreshment. Waymarsh, as a result of some discussion with his friend,\r\nhad made a marked virtue of his having now let himself go; and there\r\nhad been elements of impression in their half-hour over their watered\r\nbeer-glasses that gave him his occasion for conveying that he held this\r\ncompromise with his stiffer self to have become extreme. He conveyed\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94for it was still, after all, his stiffer self who gloomed out of the\r\nglare of the terrace\xe2\x80\x94in solemn silence; and there was indeed a great\r\ndeal of critical silence, every way, between the companions, even till\r\nthey gained the Place de l\xe2\x80\x99Op\xc3\xa9ra, as to the character of their\r\nnocturnal progress.\r\n\r\nThis morning there _were_ letters\xe2\x80\x94letters which had reached London,\r\napparently all together, the day of Strether\xe2\x80\x99s journey, and had taken\r\ntheir time to follow him; so that, after a controlled impulse to go\r\ninto them in the reception-room of the bank, which, reminding him of\r\nthe post-office at Woollett, affected him as the abutment of some\r\ntransatlantic bridge, he slipped them into the pocket of his loose grey\r\novercoat with a sense of the felicity of carrying them off. Waymarsh,\r\nwho had had letters yesterday, had had them again to-day, and Waymarsh\r\nsuggested in this particular no controlled impulses. The last one he\r\nwas at all events likely to be observed to struggle with was clearly\r\nthat of bringing to a premature close any visit to the Rue Scribe.\r\nStrether had left him there yesterday; he wanted to see the papers, and\r\nhe had spent, by what his friend could make out, a succession of hours\r\nwith the papers. He spoke of the establishment, with emphasis, as a\r\npost of superior observation; just as he spoke generally of his actual\r\ndamnable doom as a device for hiding from him what was going on. Europe\r\nwas best described, to his mind, as an elaborate engine for\r\ndissociating the confined American from that indispensable knowledge,\r\nand was accordingly only rendered bearable by these occasional stations\r\nof relief, traps for the arrest of wandering western airs. Strether, on\r\nhis side, set himself to walk again\xe2\x80\x94he had his relief in his pocket;\r\nand indeed, much as he had desired his budget, the growth of\r\nrestlessness might have been marked in him from the moment he had\r\nassured himself of the superscription of most of the missives it\r\ncontained. This restlessness became therefore his temporary law; he\r\nknew he should recognise as soon as see it the best place of all for\r\nsettling down with his chief correspondent. He had for the next hour an\r\naccidental air of looking for it in the windows of shops; he came down\r\nthe Rue de la Paix in the sun and, passing across the Tuileries and the\r\nriver, indulged more than once\xe2\x80\x94as if on finding himself determined\xe2\x80\x94in a\r\nsudden pause before the book-stalls of the opposite quay. In the garden\r\nof the Tuileries he had lingered, on two or three spots, to look; it\r\nwas as if the wonderful Paris spring had stayed him as he roamed. The\r\nprompt Paris morning struck its cheerful notes\xe2\x80\x94in a soft breeze and a\r\nsprinkled smell, in the light flit, over the garden-floor, of\r\nbareheaded girls with the buckled strap of oblong boxes, in the type of\r\nancient thrifty persons basking betimes where terrace-walls were warm,\r\nin the blue-frocked brass-labelled officialism of humble rakers and\r\nscrapers, in the deep references of a straight-pacing priest or the\r\nsharp ones of a white-gaitered red-legged soldier. He watched little\r\nbrisk figures, figures whose movement was as the tick of the great\r\nParis clock, take their smooth diagonal from point to point; the air\r\nhad a taste as of something mixed with art, something that presented\r\nnature as a white-capped master-chef. The palace was gone, Strether\r\nremembered the palace; and when he gazed into the irremediable void of\r\nits site the historic sense in him might have been freely at play\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nplay under which in Paris indeed it so often winces like a touched\r\nnerve. He filled out spaces with dim symbols of scenes; he caught the\r\ngleam of white statues at the base of which, with his letters out, he\r\ncould tilt back a straw-bottomed chair. But his drift was, for reasons,\r\nto the other side, and it floated him unspent up the Rue de Seine and\r\nas far as the Luxembourg. In the Luxembourg Gardens he pulled up; here\r\nat last he found his nook, and here, on a penny chair from which\r\nterraces, alleys, vistas, fountains, little trees in green tubs, little\r\nwomen in white caps and shrill little girls at play all sunnily\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccomposed\xe2\x80\x9d together, he passed an hour in which the cup of his\r\nimpressions seemed truly to overflow. But a week had elapsed since he\r\nquitted the ship, and there were more things in his mind than so few\r\ndays could account for. More than once, during the time, he had\r\nregarded himself as admonished; but the admonition this morning was\r\nformidably sharp. It took as it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done yet the form of a\r\nquestion\xe2\x80\x94the question of what he was doing with such an extraordinary\r\nsense of escape. This sense was sharpest after he had read his letters,\r\nbut that was also precisely why the question pressed. Four of the\r\nletters were from Mrs. Newsome and none of them short; she had lost no\r\ntime, had followed on his heels while he moved, so expressing herself\r\nthat he now could measure the probable frequency with which he should\r\nhear. They would arrive, it would seem, her communications, at the rate\r\nof several a week; he should be able to count, it might even prove, on\r\nmore than one by each mail. If he had begun yesterday with a small\r\ngrievance he had therefore an opportunity to begin to-day with its\r\nopposite. He read the letters successively and slowly, putting others\r\nback into his pocket but keeping these for a long time afterwards\r\ngathered in his lap. He held them there, lost in thought, as if to\r\nprolong the presence of what they gave him; or as if at the least to\r\nassure them their part in the constitution of some lucidity. His friend\r\nwrote admirably, and her tone was even more in her style than in her\r\nvoice\xe2\x80\x94he might almost, for the hour, have had to come this distance to\r\nget its full carrying quality; yet the plentitude of his consciousness\r\nof difference consorted perfectly with the deepened intensity of the\r\nconnexion. It was the difference, the difference of being just where he\r\nwas and _as_ he was, that formed the escape\xe2\x80\x94this difference was so much\r\ngreater than he had dreamed it would be; and what he finally sat there\r\nturning over was the strange logic of his finding himself so free. He\r\nfelt it in a manner his duty to think out his state, to approve the\r\nprocess, and when he came in fact to trace the steps and add up the\r\nitems they sufficiently accounted for the sum. He had never\r\nexpected\xe2\x80\x94that was the truth of it\xe2\x80\x94again to find himself young, and all\r\nthe years and other things it had taken to make him so were exactly his\r\npresent arithmetic. He had to make sure of them to put his scruple to\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nIt all sprang at bottom from the beauty of Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s desire that\r\nhe should be worried with nothing that was not of the essence of his\r\ntask; by insisting that he should thoroughly intermit and break she had\r\nso provided for his freedom that she would, as it were, have only\r\nherself to thank. Strether could not at this point indeed have\r\ncompleted his thought by the image of what she might have to thank\r\nherself _for_: the image, at best, of his own likeness\xe2\x80\x94poor Lambert\r\nStrether washed up on the sunny strand by the waves of a single day,\r\npoor Lambert Strether thankful for breathing-time and stiffening\r\nhimself while he gasped. There he was, and with nothing in his aspect\r\nor his posture to scandalise: it was only true that if he had seen Mrs.\r\nNewsome coming he would instinctively have jumped up to walk away a\r\nlittle. He would have come round and back to her bravely, but he would\r\nhave had first to pull himself together. She abounded in news of the\r\nsituation at home, proved to him how perfectly she was arranging for\r\nhis absence, told him who would take up this and who take up that\r\nexactly where he had left it, gave him in fact chapter and verse for\r\nthe moral that nothing would suffer. It filled for him, this tone of\r\nhers, all the air; yet it struck him at the same time as the hum of\r\nvain things. This latter effect was what he tried to justify\xe2\x80\x94and with\r\nthe success that, grave though the appearance, he at last lighted on a\r\nform that was happy. He arrived at it by the inevitable recognition of\r\nhis having been a fortnight before one of the weariest of men. If ever\r\na man had come off tired Lambert Strether was that man; and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t it\r\nbeen distinctly on the ground of his fatigue that his wonderful friend\r\nat home had so felt for him and so contrived? It seemed to him somehow\r\nat these instants that, could he only maintain with sufficient firmness\r\nhis grasp of that truth, it might become in a manner his compass and\r\nhis helm. What he wanted most was some idea that would simplify, and\r\nnothing would do this so much as the fact that he was done for and\r\nfinished. If it had been in such a light that he had just detected in\r\nhis cup the dregs of youth, that was a mere flaw of the surface of his\r\nscheme. He was so distinctly fagged-out that it must serve precisely as\r\nhis convenience, and if he could but consistently be good for little\r\nenough he might do everything he wanted.\r\n\r\nEverything he wanted was comprised moreover in a single boon\xe2\x80\x94the common\r\nunattainable art of taking things as they came. He appeared to himself\r\nto have given his best years to an active appreciation of the way they\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t come; but perhaps\xe2\x80\x94as they would seemingly here be things quite\r\nother\xe2\x80\x94this long ache might at last drop to rest. He could easily see\r\nthat from the moment he should accept the notion of his foredoomed\r\ncollapse the last thing he would lack would be reasons and memories. Oh\r\nif he _should_ do the sum no slate would hold the figures! The fact\r\nthat he had failed, as he considered, in everything, in each relation\r\nand in half a dozen trades, as he liked luxuriously to put it, might\r\nhave made, might still make, for an empty present; but it stood solidly\r\nfor a crowded past. It had not been, so much achievement missed, a\r\nlight yoke nor a short load. It was at present as if the backward\r\npicture had hung there, the long crooked course, grey in the shadow of\r\nhis solitude. It had been a dreadful cheerful sociable solitude, a\r\nsolitude of life or choice, of community; but though there had been\r\npeople enough all round it there had been but three or four persons\r\n_in_ it. Waymarsh was one of these, and the fact struck him just now as\r\nmarking the record. Mrs. Newsome was another, and Miss Gostrey had of a\r\nsudden shown signs of becoming a third. Beyond, behind them was the\r\npale figure of his real youth, which held against its breast the two\r\npresences paler than itself\xe2\x80\x94the young wife he had early lost and the\r\nyoung son he had stupidly sacrificed. He had again and again made out\r\nfor himself that he might have kept his little boy, his little dull boy\r\nwho had died at school of rapid diphtheria, if he had not in those\r\nyears so insanely given himself to merely missing the mother. It was\r\nthe soreness of his remorse that the child had in all likelihood not\r\nreally been dull\xe2\x80\x94had been dull, as he had been banished and neglected,\r\nmainly because the father had been unwittingly selfish. This was\r\ndoubtless but the secret habit of sorrow, which had slowly given way to\r\ntime; yet there remained an ache sharp enough to make the spirit, at\r\nthe sight now and again of some fair young man just growing up, wince\r\nwith the thought of an opportunity lost. Had ever a man, he had finally\r\nfallen into the way of asking himself, lost so much and even done so\r\nmuch for so little? There had been particular reasons why all\r\nyesterday, beyond other days, he should have had in one ear this cold\r\nenquiry. His name on the green cover, where he had put it for Mrs.\r\nNewsome, expressed him doubtless just enough to make the world\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nworld as distinguished, both for more and for less, from Woollett\xe2\x80\x94ask\r\nwho he was. He had incurred the ridicule of having to have his\r\nexplanation explained. He was Lambert Strether because he was on the\r\ncover, whereas it should have been, for anything like glory, that he\r\nwas on the cover because he was Lambert Strether. He would have done\r\nanything for Mrs. Newsome, have been still more ridiculous\xe2\x80\x94as he might,\r\nfor that matter, have occasion to be yet; which came to saying that\r\nthis acceptance of fate was all he had to show at fifty-five.\r\n\r\nHe judged the quantity as small because it _was_ small, and all the\r\nmore egregiously since it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, as he saw the case, so much as\r\nthinkably have been larger. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had the gift of making the most\r\nof what he tried, and if he had tried and tried again\xe2\x80\x94no one but\r\nhimself knew how often\xe2\x80\x94it appeared to have been that he might\r\ndemonstrate what else, in default of that, _could_ be made. Old ghosts\r\nof experiments came back to him, old drudgeries and delusions, and\r\ndisgusts, old recoveries with their relapses, old fevers with their\r\nchills, broken moments of good faith, others of still better doubt;\r\nadventures, for the most part, of the sort qualified as lessons. The\r\nspecial spring that had constantly played for him the day before was\r\nthe recognition\xe2\x80\x94frequent enough to surprise him\xe2\x80\x94of the promises to\r\nhimself that he had after his other visit never kept. The reminiscence\r\nto-day most quickened for him was that of the vow taken in the course\r\nof the pilgrimage that, newly-married, with the War just over, and\r\nhelplessly young in spite of it, he had recklessly made with the\r\ncreature who was so much younger still. It had been a bold dash, for\r\nwhich they had taken money set apart for necessities, but kept sacred\r\nat the moment in a hundred ways, and in none more so than by this\r\nprivate pledge of his own to treat the occasion as a relation formed\r\nwith the higher culture and see that, as they said at Woollett, it\r\nshould bear a good harvest. He had believed, sailing home again, that\r\nhe had gained something great, and his theory\xe2\x80\x94with an elaborate\r\ninnocent plan of reading, digesting, coming back even, every few\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x94had then been to preserve, cherish and extend it. As such plans\r\nas these had come to nothing, however, in respect to acquisitions still\r\nmore precious, it was doubtless little enough of a marvel that he\r\nshould have lost account of that handful of seed. Buried for long years\r\nin dark corners at any rate these few germs had sprouted again under\r\nforty-eight hours of Paris. The process of yesterday had really been\r\nthe process of feeling the general stirred life of connexions long\r\nsince individually dropped. Strether had become acquainted even on this\r\nground with short gusts of speculation\xe2\x80\x94sudden flights of fancy in\r\nLouvre galleries, hungry gazes through clear plates behind which\r\nlemon-coloured volumes were as fresh as fruit on the tree.\r\n\r\nThere were instants at which he could ask whether, since there had been\r\nfundamentally so little question of his keeping anything, the fate\r\nafter all decreed for him hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been only to _be_ kept. Kept for\r\nsomething, in that event, that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t pretend, didn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly dare\r\nas yet to divine; something that made him hover and wonder and laugh\r\nand sigh, made him advance and retreat, feeling half ashamed of his\r\nimpulse to plunge and more than half afraid of his impulse to wait. He\r\nremembered for instance how he had gone back in the sixties with\r\nlemon-coloured volumes in general on the brain as well as with a\r\ndozen\xe2\x80\x94selected for his wife too\xe2\x80\x94in his trunk; and nothing had at the\r\nmoment shown more confidence than this invocation of the finer taste.\r\nThey were still somewhere at home, the dozen\xe2\x80\x94stale and soiled and never\r\nsent to the binder; but what had become of the sharp initiation they\r\nrepresented? They represented now the mere sallow paint on the door of\r\nthe temple of taste that he had dreamed of raising up\xe2\x80\x94a structure he\r\nhad practically never carried further. Strether\xe2\x80\x99s present highest\r\nflights were perhaps those in which this particular lapse figured to\r\nhim as a symbol, a symbol of his long grind and his want of odd\r\nmoments, his want moreover of money, of opportunity, of positive\r\ndignity. That the memory of the vow of his youth should, in order to\r\nthrob again, have had to wait for this last, as he felt it, of all his\r\naccidents\xe2\x80\x94that was surely proof enough of how his conscience had been\r\nencumbered. If any further proof were needed it would have been to be\r\nfound in the fact that, as he perfectly now saw, he had ceased even to\r\nmeasure his meagreness, a meagreness that sprawled, in this retrospect,\r\nvague and comprehensive, stretching back like some unmapped Hinterland\r\nfrom a rough coast-settlement. His conscience had been amusing itself\r\nfor the forty-eight hours by forbidding him the purchase of a book; he\r\nheld off from that, held off from everything; from the moment he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyet call on Chad he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t for the world have taken any other step.\r\nOn this evidence, however, of the way they actually affected him he\r\nglared at the lemon-coloured covers in confession of the\r\nsubconsciousness that, all the same, in the great desert of the years,\r\nhe must have had of them. The green covers at home comprised, by the\r\nlaw of their purpose, no tribute to letters; it was of a mere rich\r\nkernel of economics, politics, ethics that, glazed and, as Mrs. Newsome\r\nmaintained rather against _his_ view, pre-eminently pleasant to touch,\r\nthey formed the specious shell. Without therefore any needed\r\ninstinctive knowledge of what was coming out, in Paris, on the bright\r\nhighway, he struck himself at present as having more than once flushed\r\nwith a suspicion: he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t otherwise at present be feeling so many\r\nfears confirmed. There were \xe2\x80\x9cmovements\xe2\x80\x9d he was too late for: weren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthey, with the fun of them, already spent? There were sequences he had\r\nmissed and great gaps in the procession: he might have been watching it\r\nall recede in a golden cloud of dust. If the playhouse wasn\xe2\x80\x99t closed\r\nhis seat had at least fallen to somebody else. He had had an uneasy\r\nfeeling the night before that if he was at the theatre at all\xe2\x80\x94though he\r\nindeed justified the theatre, in the specific sense, and with a\r\ngrotesqueness to which his imagination did all honour, as something he\r\nowed poor Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x94he should have been there with, and as might have\r\nbeen said, _for_ Chad.\r\n\r\nThis suggested the question of whether he could properly have taken him\r\nto such a play, and what effect\xe2\x80\x94it was a point that suddenly rose\xe2\x80\x94his\r\npeculiar responsibility might be held in general to have on his choice\r\nof entertainment. It had literally been present to him at the\r\nGymnase\xe2\x80\x94where one was held moreover comparatively safe\xe2\x80\x94that having his\r\nyoung friend at his side would have been an odd feature of the work of\r\nredemption; and this quite in spite of the fact that the picture\r\npresented might well, confronted with Chad\xe2\x80\x99s own private stage, have\r\nseemed the pattern of propriety. He clearly hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come out in the name\r\nof propriety but to visit unattended equivocal performances; yet still\r\nless had he done so to undermine his authority by sharing them with the\r\ngraceless youth. Was he to renounce all amusement for the sweet sake of\r\nthat authority? and _would_ such renouncement give him for Chad a moral\r\nglamour? The little problem bristled the more by reason of poor\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s fairly open sense of the irony of things. Were there then\r\nsides on which his predicament threatened to look rather droll to him?\r\nShould he have to pretend to believe\xe2\x80\x94either to himself or the wretched\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x94that there was anything that could make the latter worse? Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsome such pretence on the other hand involved in the assumption of\r\npossible processes that would make him better? His greatest uneasiness\r\nseemed to peep at him out of the imminent impression that almost any\r\nacceptance of Paris might give one\xe2\x80\x99s authority away. It hung before him\r\nthis morning, the vast bright Babylon, like some huge iridescent\r\nobject, a jewel brilliant and hard, in which parts were not to be\r\ndiscriminated nor differences comfortably marked. It twinkled and\r\ntrembled and melted together, and what seemed all surface one moment\r\nseemed all depth the next. It was a place of which, unmistakeably, Chad\r\nwas fond; wherefore if he, Strether, should like it too much, what on\r\nearth, with such a bond, would become of either of them? It all\r\ndepended of course\xe2\x80\x94which was a gleam of light\xe2\x80\x94on how the \xe2\x80\x9ctoo much\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nmeasured; though indeed our friend fairly felt, while he prolonged the\r\nmeditation I describe, that for himself even already a certain measure\r\nhad been reached. It will have been sufficiently seen that he was not a\r\nman to neglect any good chance for reflexion. Was it at all possible\r\nfor instance to like Paris enough without liking it too much? He\r\nluckily however hadn\xe2\x80\x99t promised Mrs. Newsome not to like it at all. He\r\nwas ready to recognise at this stage that such an engagement _would_\r\nhave tied his hands. The Luxembourg Gardens were incontestably just so\r\nadorable at this hour by reason\xe2\x80\x94in addition to their intrinsic charm\xe2\x80\x94of\r\nhis not having taken it. The only engagement he had taken, when he\r\nlooked the thing in the face, was to do what he reasonably could.\r\n\r\nIt upset him a little none the less and after a while to find himself\r\nat last remembering on what current of association he had been floated\r\nso far. Old imaginations of the Latin Quarter had played their part for\r\nhim, and he had duly recalled its having been with this scene of rather\r\nominous legend that, like so many young men in fiction as well as in\r\nfact, Chad had begun. He was now quite out of it, with his \xe2\x80\x9chome,\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\nStrether figured the place, in the Boulevard Malesherbes, now; which\r\nwas perhaps why, repairing, not to fail of justice either, to the elder\r\nneighbourhood, our friend had felt he could allow for the element of\r\nthe usual, the immemorial, without courting perturbation. He was not at\r\nleast in danger of seeing the youth and the particular Person flaunt by\r\ntogether; and yet he was in the very air of which\xe2\x80\x94just to feel what the\r\nearly natural note must have been\xe2\x80\x94he wished most to take counsel. It\r\nbecame at once vivid to him that he had originally had, for a few days,\r\nan almost envious vision of the boy\xe2\x80\x99s romantic privilege. Melancholy\r\nM\xc3\xbcrger, with Francine and Musette and Rodolphe, at home, was, in the\r\ncompany of the tattered, one\xe2\x80\x94if he not in his single self two or\r\nthree\xe2\x80\x94of the unbound, the paper-covered dozen on the shelf; and when\r\nChad had written, five years ago, after a sojourn then already\r\nprolonged to six months, that he had decided to go in for economy and\r\nthe real thing, Strether\xe2\x80\x99s fancy had quite fondly accompanied him in\r\nthis migration, which was to convey him, as they somewhat confusedly\r\nlearned at Woollett, across the bridges and up the Montagne\r\nSainte-Genevi\xc3\xa8ve. This was the region\xe2\x80\x94Chad had been quite distinct\r\nabout it\xe2\x80\x94in which the best French, and many other things, were to be\r\nlearned at least cost, and in which all sorts of clever fellows,\r\ncompatriots there for a purpose, formed an awfully pleasant set. The\r\nclever fellows, the friendly countrymen were mainly young painters,\r\nsculptors, architects, medical students; but they were, Chad sagely\r\nopined, a much more profitable lot to be with\xe2\x80\x94even on the footing of\r\nnot being quite one of them\xe2\x80\x94than the \xe2\x80\x9cterrible toughs\xe2\x80\x9d (Strether\r\nremembered the edifying discrimination) of the American bars and banks\r\nroundabout the Op\xc3\xa9ra. Chad had thrown out, in the communications\r\nfollowing this one\xe2\x80\x94for at that time he did once in a while\r\ncommunicate\xe2\x80\x94that several members of a band of earnest workers under one\r\nof the great artists had taken him right in, making him dine every\r\nnight, almost for nothing, at their place, and even pressing him not to\r\nneglect the hypothesis of there being as much \xe2\x80\x9cin him\xe2\x80\x9d as in any of\r\nthem. There had been literally a moment at which it appeared there\r\nmight be something in him; there had been at any rate a moment at which\r\nhe had written that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know but what a month or two more might\r\nsee him enrolled in some _atelier_. The season had been one at which\r\nMrs. Newsome was moved to gratitude for small mercies; it had broken on\r\nthem all as a blessing that their absentee _had_ perhaps a\r\nconscience\xe2\x80\x94that he was sated in fine with idleness, was ambitious of\r\nvariety. The exhibition was doubtless as yet not brilliant, but\r\nStrether himself, even by that time much enlisted and immersed, had\r\ndetermined, on the part of the two ladies, a temperate approval and in\r\nfact, as he now recollected, a certain austere enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nBut the very next thing that happened had been a dark drop of the\r\ncurtain. The son and brother had not browsed long on the Montagne\r\nSainte-Genevi\xc3\xa8ve\xe2\x80\x94his effective little use of the name of which, like\r\nhis allusion to the best French, appeared to have been but one of the\r\nnotes of his rough cunning. The light refreshment of these vain\r\nappearances had not accordingly carried any of them very far. On the\r\nother hand it had gained Chad time; it had given him a chance,\r\nunchecked, to strike his roots, had paved the way for initiations more\r\ndirect and more deep. It was Strether\xe2\x80\x99s belief that he had been\r\ncomparatively innocent before this first migration, and even that the\r\nfirst effects of the migration would not have been, without some\r\nparticular bad accident, to have been deplored. There had been three\r\nmonths\xe2\x80\x94he had sufficiently figured it out\xe2\x80\x94in which Chad had wanted to\r\ntry. He _had_ tried, though not very hard\xe2\x80\x94he had had his little hour of\r\ngood faith. The weakness of this principle in him was that almost any\r\naccident attestedly bad enough was stronger. Such had at any rate\r\nmarkedly been the case for the precipitation of a special series of\r\nimpressions. They had proved, successively, these impressions\xe2\x80\x94all of\r\nMusette and Francine, but Musette and Francine vulgarised by the larger\r\nevolution of the type\xe2\x80\x94irresistibly sharp: he had \xe2\x80\x9ctaken up,\xe2\x80\x9d by what\r\nwas at the time to be shrinkingly gathered, as it was scantly\r\nmentioned, with one ferociously \xe2\x80\x9cinterested\xe2\x80\x9d little person after\r\nanother. Strether had read somewhere of a Latin motto, a description of\r\nthe hours, observed on a clock by a traveller in Spain; and he had been\r\nled to apply it in thought to Chad\xe2\x80\x99s number one, number two, number\r\nthree. _Omnes vulnerant, ultima necat_\xe2\x80\x94they had all morally wounded,\r\nthe last had morally killed. The last had been longest in possession\xe2\x80\x94in\r\npossession, that is, of whatever was left of the poor boy\xe2\x80\x99s finer\r\nmortality. And it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been she, it had been one of her early\r\npredecessors, who had determined the second migration, the expensive\r\nreturn and relapse, the exchange again, as was fairly to be presumed,\r\nof the vaunted best French for some special variety of the worst.\r\n\r\nHe pulled himself then at last together for his own progress back; not\r\nwith the feeling that he had taken his walk in vain. He prolonged it a\r\nlittle, in the immediate neighbourhood, after he had quitted his chair;\r\nand the upshot of the whole morning for him was that his campaign had\r\nbegun. He had wanted to put himself in relation, and he would be hanged\r\nif he were _not_ in relation. He was that at no moment so much as\r\nwhile, under the old arches of the Od\xc3\xa9on, he lingered before the\r\ncharming open-air array of literature classic and casual. He found the\r\neffect of tone and tint, in the long charged tables and shelves,\r\ndelicate and appetising; the impression\xe2\x80\x94substituting one kind of\r\nlow-priced _consommation_ for another\xe2\x80\x94might have been that of one of\r\nthe pleasant caf\xc3\xa9s that overlapped, under an awning, to the pavement;\r\nbut he edged along, grazing the tables, with his hands firmly behind\r\nhim. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there to dip, to consume\xe2\x80\x94he was there to reconstruct. He\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t there for his own profit\xe2\x80\x94not, that is, the direct; he was there\r\non some chance of feeling the brush of the wing of the stray spirit of\r\nyouth. He felt it in fact, he had it beside him; the old arcade indeed,\r\nas his inner sense listened, gave out the faint sound, as from far off,\r\nof the wild waving of wings. They were folded now over the breasts of\r\nburied generations; but a flutter or two lived again in the turned page\r\nof shock-headed slouch-hatted loiterers whose young intensity of type,\r\nin the direction of pale acuteness, deepened his vision, and even his\r\nappreciation, of racial differences, and whose manipulation of the\r\nuncut volume was too often, however, but a listening at closed doors.\r\nHe reconstructed a possible groping Chad of three or four years before,\r\na Chad who had, after all, simply\xe2\x80\x94for that was the only way to see\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94been too vulgar for his privilege. Surely it _was_ a privilege to\r\nhave been young and happy just there. Well, the best thing Strether\r\nknew of him was that he had had such a dream.\r\n\r\nBut his own actual business, half an hour later, was with a third floor\r\non the Boulevard Malesherbes\xe2\x80\x94so much as that was definite; and the fact\r\nof the enjoyment by the third-floor windows of a continuous balcony, to\r\nwhich he was helped by this knowledge, had perhaps something to do with\r\nhis lingering for five minutes on the opposite side of the street.\r\nThere were points as to which he had quite made up his mind, and one of\r\nthese bore precisely on the wisdom of the abruptness to which events\r\nhad finally committed him, a policy that he was pleased to find not at\r\nall shaken as he now looked at his watch and wondered. He _had_\r\nannounced himself\xe2\x80\x94six months before; had written out at least that Chad\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t to be surprised should he see him some day turn up. Chad had\r\nthereupon, in a few words of rather carefully colourless answer,\r\noffered him a general welcome; and Strether, ruefully reflecting that\r\nhe might have understood the warning as a hint to hospitality, a bid\r\nfor an invitation, had fallen back upon silence as the corrective most\r\nto his own taste. He had asked Mrs. Newsome moreover not to announce\r\nhim again; he had so distinct an opinion on his attacking his job,\r\nshould he attack it at all, in his own way. Not the least of this\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s high merits for him was that he could absolutely rest on her\r\nword. She was the only woman he had known, even at Woollett, as to whom\r\nhis conviction was positive that to lie was beyond her art. Sarah\r\nPocock, for instance, her own daughter, though with social ideals, as\r\nthey said, in some respects different\xe2\x80\x94Sarah who _was_, in her way,\r\n\xc3\xa6sthetic, had never refused to human commerce that mitigation of\r\nrigour; there were occasions when he had distinctly seen her apply it.\r\nSince, accordingly, at all events, he had had it from Mrs. Newsome that\r\nshe had, at whatever cost to her more strenuous view, conformed, in the\r\nmatter of preparing Chad, wholly to his restrictions, he now looked up\r\nat the fine continuous balcony with a safe sense that if the case had\r\nbeen bungled the mistake was at least his property. Was there perhaps\r\njust a suspicion of that in his present pause on the edge of the\r\nBoulevard and well in the pleasant light?\r\n\r\nMany things came over him here, and one of them was that he should\r\ndoubtless presently know whether he had been shallow or sharp. Another\r\nwas that the balcony in question didn\xe2\x80\x99t somehow show as a convenience\r\neasy to surrender. Poor Strether had at this very moment to recognise\r\nthe truth that wherever one paused in Paris the imagination reacted\r\nbefore one could stop it. This perpetual reaction put a price, if one\r\nwould, on pauses; but it piled up consequences till there was scarce\r\nroom to pick one\xe2\x80\x99s steps among them. What call had he, at such a\r\njuncture, for example, to like Chad\xe2\x80\x99s very house? High broad clear\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nwas expert enough to make out in a moment that it was admirably\r\nbuilt\xe2\x80\x94it fairly embarrassed our friend by the quality that, as he would\r\nhave said, it \xe2\x80\x9csprang\xe2\x80\x9d on him. He had struck off the fancy that it\r\nmight, as a preliminary, be of service to him to be seen, by a happy\r\naccident, from the third-story windows, which took all the March sun,\r\nbut of what service was it to find himself making out after a moment\r\nthat the quality \xe2\x80\x9csprung,\xe2\x80\x9d the quality produced by measure and balance,\r\nthe fine relation of part to part and space to space, was\r\nprobably\xe2\x80\x94aided by the presence of ornament as positive as it was\r\ndiscreet, and by the complexion of the stone, a cold fair grey, warmed\r\nand polished a little by life\xe2\x80\x94neither more nor less than a case of\r\ndistinction, such a case as he could only feel unexpectedly as a sort\r\nof delivered challenge? Meanwhile, however, the chance he had allowed\r\nfor\xe2\x80\x94the chance of being seen in time from the balcony\xe2\x80\x94had become a\r\nfact. Two or three of the windows stood open to the violet air; and,\r\nbefore Strether had cut the knot by crossing, a young man had come out\r\nand looked about him, had lighted a cigarette and tossed the match\r\nover, and then, resting on the rail, had given himself up to watching\r\nthe life below while he smoked. His arrival contributed, in its order,\r\nto keeping Strether in position; the result of which in turn was that\r\nStrether soon felt himself noticed. The young man began to look at him\r\nas in acknowledgement of his being himself in observation.\r\n\r\nThis was interesting so far as it went, but the interest was affected\r\nby the young man\xe2\x80\x99s not being Chad. Strether wondered at first if he\r\nwere perhaps Chad altered, and then saw that this was asking too much\r\nof alteration. The young man was light bright and alert\xe2\x80\x94with an air too\r\npleasant to have been arrived at by patching. Strether had conceived\r\nChad as patched, but not beyond recognition. He was in presence, he\r\nfelt, of amendments enough as they stood; it was a sufficient amendment\r\nthat the gentleman up there should be Chad\xe2\x80\x99s friend. He was young too\r\nthen, the gentleman up there\xe2\x80\x94he was very young; young enough apparently\r\nto be amused at an elderly watcher, to be curious even to see what the\r\nelderly watcher would do on finding himself watched. There was youth in\r\nthat, there was youth in the surrender to the balcony, there was youth\r\nfor Strether at this moment in everything but his own business; and\r\nChad\xe2\x80\x99s thus pronounced association with youth had given the next\r\ninstant an extraordinary quick lift to the issue. The balcony, the\r\ndistinguished front, testified suddenly, for Strether\xe2\x80\x99s fancy, to\r\nsomething that was up and up; they placed the whole case materially,\r\nand as by an admirable image, on a level that he found himself at the\r\nend of another moment rejoicing to think he might reach. The young man\r\nlooked at him still, he looked at the young man; and the issue, by a\r\nrapid process, was that this knowledge of a perched privacy appeared to\r\nhim the last of luxuries. To him too the perched privacy was open, and\r\nhe saw it now but in one light\xe2\x80\x94that of the only domicile, the only\r\nfireside, in the great ironic city, on which he had the shadow of a\r\nclaim. Miss Gostrey had a fireside; she had told him of it, and it was\r\nsomething that doubtless awaited him; but Miss Gostrey hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet\r\narrived\xe2\x80\x94she mightn\xe2\x80\x99t arrive for days; and the sole attenuation of his\r\nexcluded state was his vision of the small, the admittedly secondary\r\nhotel in the bye-street from the Rue de la Paix, in which her\r\nsolicitude for his purse had placed him, which affected him somehow as\r\nall indoor chill, glass-roofed court and slippery staircase, and which,\r\nby the same token, expressed the presence of Waymarsh even at times\r\nwhen Waymarsh might have been certain to be round at the bank. It came\r\nto pass before he moved that Waymarsh, and Waymarsh alone, Waymarsh not\r\nonly undiluted but positively strengthened, struck him as the present\r\nalternative to the young man in the balcony. When he did move it was\r\nfairly to escape that alternative. Taking his way over the street at\r\nlast and passing through the _porte-coch\xc3\xa8re_ of the house was like\r\nconsciously leaving Waymarsh out. However, he would tell him all about\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook Third\r\n\r\n\r\n I\r\n\r\nStrether told Waymarsh all about it that very evening, on their dining\r\ntogether at the hotel; which needn\xe2\x80\x99t have happened, he was all the\r\nwhile aware, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t he chosen to sacrifice to this occasion a rarer\r\nopportunity. The mention to his companion of the sacrifice was moreover\r\nexactly what introduced his recital\xe2\x80\x94or, as he would have called it with\r\nmore confidence in his interlocutor, his confession. His confession was\r\nthat he had been captured and that one of the features of the affair\r\nhad just failed to be his engaging himself on the spot to dinner. As by\r\nsuch a freedom Waymarsh would have lost him he had obeyed his scruple;\r\nand he had likewise obeyed another scruple\xe2\x80\x94which bore on the question\r\nof his himself bringing a guest.\r\n\r\nWaymarsh looked gravely ardent, over the finished soup, at this array\r\nof scruples; Strether hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet got quite used to being so unprepared\r\nfor the consequences of the impression he produced. It was\r\ncomparatively easy to explain, however, that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t felt sure his\r\nguest would please. The person was a young man whose acquaintance he\r\nhad made but that afternoon in the course of rather a hindered enquiry\r\nfor another person\xe2\x80\x94an enquiry his new friend had just prevented in fact\r\nfrom being vain. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve all sorts of things to tell\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he put it in a way that was a virtual hint to Waymarsh to\r\nhelp him to enjoy the telling. He waited for his fish, he drank of his\r\nwine, he wiped his long moustache, he leaned back in his chair, he took\r\nin the two English ladies who had just creaked past them and whom he\r\nwould even have articulately greeted if they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t rather chilled the\r\nimpulse; so that all he could do was\xe2\x80\x94by way of doing something\xe2\x80\x94to say\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMerci, Fran\xc3\xa7ois!\xe2\x80\x9d out quite loud when his fish was brought. Everything\r\nwas there that he wanted, everything that could make the moment an\r\noccasion, that would do beautifully\xe2\x80\x94everything but what Waymarsh might\r\ngive. The little waxed salle-\xc3\xa0-manger was sallow and sociable;\r\nFran\xc3\xa7ois, dancing over it, all smiles, was a man and a brother; the\r\nhigh-shouldered patronne, with her high-held, much-rubbed hands, seemed\r\nalways assenting exuberantly to something unsaid; the Paris evening in\r\nshort was, for Strether, in the very taste of the soup, in the\r\ngoodness, as he was innocently pleased to think it, of the wine, in the\r\npleasant coarse texture of the napkin and the crunch of the\r\nthick-crusted bread. These all were things congruous with his\r\nconfession, and his confession was that he _had_\xe2\x80\x94it would come out\r\nproperly just there if Waymarsh would only take it properly\xe2\x80\x94agreed to\r\nbreakfast out, at twelve literally, the next day. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite know\r\nwhere; the delicacy of the case came straight up in the remembrance of\r\nhis new friend\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll see; I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you somewhere!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for it had\r\nrequired little more than that, after all, to let him right in. He was\r\naffected after a minute, face to face with his actual comrade, by the\r\nimpulse to overcolour. There had already been things in respect to\r\nwhich he knew himself tempted by this perversity. If Waymarsh thought\r\nthem bad he should at least have his reason for his discomfort; so\r\nStrether showed them as worse. Still, he was now, in his way, sincerely\r\nperplexed.\r\n\r\nChad had been absent from the Boulevard Malesherbes\xe2\x80\x94was absent from\r\nParis altogether; he had learned that from the concierge, but had\r\nnevertheless gone up, and gone up\xe2\x80\x94there were no two ways about it\xe2\x80\x94from\r\nan uncontrollable, a really, if one would, depraved curiosity. The\r\nconcierge had mentioned to him that a friend of the tenant of the\r\ntroisi\xc3\xa8me was for the time in possession; and this had been Strether\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npretext for a further enquiry, an experiment carried on, under Chad\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroof, without his knowledge. \xe2\x80\x9cI found his friend in fact there keeping\r\nthe place warm, as he called it, for him; Chad himself being, as\r\nappears, in the south. He went a month ago to Cannes and though his\r\nreturn begins to be looked for it can\xe2\x80\x99t be for some days. I might, you\r\nsee, perfectly have waited a week; might have beaten a retreat as soon\r\nas I got this essential knowledge. But I beat no retreat; I did the\r\nopposite; I stayed, I dawdled, I trifled; above all I looked round. I\r\nsaw, in fine; and\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to call it\xe2\x80\x94I sniffed. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ndetail, but it\xe2\x80\x99s as if there were something\xe2\x80\x94something very good\xe2\x80\x94_to_\r\nsniff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s face had shown his friend an attention apparently so remote\r\nthat the latter was slightly surprised to find it at this point abreast\r\nwith him. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean a smell? What of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA charming scent. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaymarsh gave an inferential grunt. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes he live there with a woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaymarsh waited an instant for more, then resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cHas he taken her\r\noff with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will he bring her back?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Strether fell into the enquiry. But he\r\nwound it up as before. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe way he wound it up, accompanied as this was with another drop back,\r\nanother degustation of the L\xc3\xa9oville, another wipe of his moustache and\r\nanother good word for Fran\xc3\xa7ois, seemed to produce in his companion a\r\nslight irritation. \xe2\x80\x9cThen what the devil _do_ you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether almost gaily, \xe2\x80\x9cI guess I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHis gaiety might have been a tribute to the fact that the state he had\r\nbeen reduced to did for him again what had been done by his talk of the\r\nmatter with Miss Gostrey at the London theatre. It was somehow\r\nenlarging; and the air of that amplitude was now doubtless more or\r\nless\xe2\x80\x94and all for Waymarsh to feel\xe2\x80\x94in his further response. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nI found out from the young man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought you said you found out nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing but that\xe2\x80\x94that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what good does that do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to you to help me to\r\ndiscover. I mean anything about anything over here. I _felt_ that, up\r\nthere. It regularly rose before me in its might. The young man\r\nmoreover\xe2\x80\x94Chad\xe2\x80\x99s friend\xe2\x80\x94as good as told me so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs good as told you you know nothing about anything?\xe2\x80\x9d Waymarsh\r\nappeared to look at some one who might have as good as told _him_. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nold is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I guess not thirty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet you had to take that from him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I took a good deal more\xe2\x80\x94since, as I tell you, I took an invitation\r\nto d\xc3\xa9jeuner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you _going_ to that unholy meal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ll come with me. He wants you too, you know. I told him about\r\nyou. He gave me his card,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cand his name\xe2\x80\x99s rather\r\nfunny. It\xe2\x80\x99s John Little Bilham, and he says his two surnames are, on\r\naccount of his being small, inevitably used together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Waymarsh asked with due detachment from these details, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhe doing up there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis account of himself is that he\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98only a little artist-man.\xe2\x80\x99 That\r\nseemed to me perfectly to describe him. But he\xe2\x80\x99s yet in the phase of\r\nstudy; this, you know, is the great art-school\xe2\x80\x94to pass a certain number\r\nof years in which he came over. And he\xe2\x80\x99s a great friend of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\noccupying Chad\xe2\x80\x99s rooms just now because they\xe2\x80\x99re so pleasant. _He\xe2\x80\x99s_\r\nvery pleasant and curious too,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether added\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthough he\xe2\x80\x99s not from\r\nBoston.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaymarsh looked already rather sick of him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere _is_ he from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that, either. But he\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98notoriously,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nas he put it himself, not from Boston.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Waymarsh moralised from dry depths, \xe2\x80\x9cevery one can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nnotoriously _be_ from Boston. Why,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cis he curious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps just for _that_\xe2\x80\x94for one thing! But really,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor everything. When you meet him you\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to meet him,\xe2\x80\x9d Waymarsh impatiently growled. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhe go home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, because he likes it over here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis appeared in particular more than Waymarsh could bear. \xe2\x80\x9cHe ought\r\nthen to be ashamed of himself, and, as you admit that you think so too,\r\nwhy drag him in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s reply again took time. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I do think so myself\xe2\x80\x94though\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite yet admit it. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a bit sure\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s again one of the\r\nthings I want to find out. I liked him, and _can_ you like people\xe2\x80\x94? But\r\nno matter.\xe2\x80\x9d He pulled himself up. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt I want you to come\r\ndown on me and squash me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaymarsh helped himself to the next course, which, however proving not\r\nthe dish he had just noted as supplied to the English ladies, had the\r\neffect of causing his imagination temporarily to wander. But it\r\npresently broke out at a softer spot. \xe2\x80\x9cHave they got a handsome place\r\nup there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh a charming place; full of beautiful and valuable things. I never\r\nsaw such a place\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and Strether\xe2\x80\x99s thought went back to it. \xe2\x80\x9cFor a little\r\nartist-man\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d He could in fact scarce express it.\r\n\r\nBut his companion, who appeared now to have a view, insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, life can hold nothing better. Besides, they\xe2\x80\x99re things of which\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s in charge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that he does doorkeeper for your precious pair? Can life,\xe2\x80\x9d Waymarsh\r\nenquired, \xe2\x80\x9chold nothing better than _that?_\xe2\x80\x9d Then as Strether, silent,\r\nseemed even yet to wonder, \xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t he know what _she_ is?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask him. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. It was impossible. You\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t either. Besides I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to. No more would you.\xe2\x80\x9d Strether\r\nin short explained it at a stroke. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t make out over here what\r\npeople do know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what did you come over for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I suppose exactly to see for myself\xe2\x80\x94without their aid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what do you want mine for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re not one of _them!_ I do know what _you_\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs, however, this last assertion caused Waymarsh again to look at him\r\nhard\xe2\x80\x94such being the latter\xe2\x80\x99s doubt of its implications\xe2\x80\x94he felt his\r\njustification lame. Which was still more the case when Waymarsh\r\npresently said: \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Strether. Quit this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur friend smiled with a doubt of his own. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean my tone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94damn your tone. I mean your nosing round. Quit the whole job. Let\r\nthem stew in their juice. You\xe2\x80\x99re being used for a thing you ain\xe2\x80\x99t fit\r\nfor. People don\xe2\x80\x99t take a fine-tooth comb to groom a horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I a fine-tooth comb?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something I never\r\ncalled myself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s what you are, all the same. You ain\xe2\x80\x99t so young as you were, but\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve kept your teeth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe acknowledged his friend\xe2\x80\x99s humour. \xe2\x80\x9cTake care I don\xe2\x80\x99t get them into\r\n_you!_ You\xe2\x80\x99d like them, my friends at home, Waymarsh,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99d really particularly like them. And I know\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it was slightly\r\nirrelevant, but he gave it sudden and singular force\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI know they\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nlike you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh don\xe2\x80\x99t work them off on _me!_\xe2\x80\x9d Waymarsh groaned.\r\n\r\nYet Strether still lingered with his hands in his pockets. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s really\r\nquite as indispensable as I say that Chad should be got back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndispensable to whom? To you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether presently said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause if you get him you also get Mrs. Newsome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether faced it. \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get him you don\xe2\x80\x99t get her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt might be merciless, but he continued not to flinch. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\r\nmight have some effect on our personal understanding. Chad\xe2\x80\x99s of real\r\nimportance\xe2\x80\x94or can easily become so if he will\xe2\x80\x94to the business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the business is of real importance to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I naturally want what my future wife wants. And the thing will\r\nbe much better if we have our own man in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have your own man in it, in other words,\xe2\x80\x9d Waymarsh said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll marry\xe2\x80\x94you personally\xe2\x80\x94more money. She\xe2\x80\x99s already rich, as I\r\nunderstand you, but she\xe2\x80\x99ll be richer still if the business can be made\r\nto boom on certain lines that you\xe2\x80\x99ve laid down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ haven\xe2\x80\x99t laid them down,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether promptly returned. \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nNewsome\xe2\x80\x94who knew extraordinarily well what he was about\xe2\x80\x94laid them down\r\nten years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh well, Waymarsh seemed to indicate with a shake of his mane, _that_\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t matter! \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re fierce for the boom anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend weighed a moment in silence the justice of the charge. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan scarcely be called fierce, I think, when I so freely take my chance\r\nof the possibility, the danger, of being influenced in a sense counter\r\nto Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s own feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaymarsh gave this proposition a long hard look. \xe2\x80\x9cI see. You\xe2\x80\x99re afraid\r\nyourself of being squared. But you\xe2\x80\x99re a humbug,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9call the\r\nsame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether quickly protested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you ask me for protection\xe2\x80\x94which makes you very interesting; and\r\nthen you won\xe2\x80\x99t take it. You say you want to be squashed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but not so easily! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether demanded \xe2\x80\x9cwhere my\r\ninterest, as already shown you, lies? It lies in my not being squared.\r\nIf I\xe2\x80\x99m squared where\xe2\x80\x99s my marriage? If I miss my errand I miss that;\r\nand if I miss that I miss everything\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m nowhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaymarsh\xe2\x80\x94but all relentlessly\xe2\x80\x94took this in. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I care where you\r\nare if you\xe2\x80\x99re spoiled?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met on it an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you awfully,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether at last\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you think _her_ judgement of that\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOught to content me? No.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt kept them again face to face, and the end of this was that Strether\r\nagain laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do her injustice. You really _must_ know her.\r\nGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe breakfasted with Mr. Bilham on the morrow, and, as inconsequently\r\nbefell, with Waymarsh massively of the party. The latter announced, at\r\nthe eleventh hour and much to his friend\xe2\x80\x99s surprise, that, damn it, he\r\nwould as soon join him as do anything else; on which they proceeded\r\ntogether, strolling in a state of detachment practically luxurious for\r\nthem to the Boulevard Malesherbes, a couple engaged that day with the\r\nsharp spell of Paris as confessedly, it might have been seen, as any\r\ncouple among the daily thousands so compromised. They walked, wandered,\r\nwondered and, a little, lost themselves; Strether hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had for years\r\nso rich a consciousness of time\xe2\x80\x94a bag of gold into which he constantly\r\ndipped for a handful. It was present to him that when the little\r\nbusiness with Mr. Bilham should be over he would still have shining\r\nhours to use absolutely as he liked. There was no great pulse of haste\r\nyet in this process of saving Chad; nor was that effect a bit more\r\nmarked as he sat, half an hour later, with his legs under Chad\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmahogany, with Mr. Bilham on one side, with a friend of Mr. Bilham\xe2\x80\x99s on\r\nthe other, with Waymarsh stupendously opposite, and with the great hum\r\nof Paris coming up in softness, vagueness\xe2\x80\x94for Strether himself indeed\r\nalready positive sweetness\xe2\x80\x94through the sunny windows toward which, the\r\nday before, his curiosity had raised its wings from below. The feeling\r\nstrongest with him at that moment had borne fruit almost faster than he\r\ncould taste it, and Strether literally felt at the present hour that\r\nthere was a precipitation in his fate. He had known nothing and nobody\r\nas he stood in the street; but hadn\xe2\x80\x99t his view now taken a bound in the\r\ndirection of every one and of every thing?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s he up to, what\xe2\x80\x99s he up to?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94something like that was at the back\r\nof his head all the while in respect to little Bilham; but meanwhile,\r\ntill he should make out, every one and every thing were as good as\r\nrepresented for him by the combination of his host and the lady on his\r\nleft. The lady on his left, the lady thus promptly and ingeniously\r\ninvited to \xe2\x80\x9cmeet\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Strether and Mr. Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x94it was the way she\r\nherself expressed her case\xe2\x80\x94was a very marked person, a person who had\r\nmuch to do with our friend\xe2\x80\x99s asking himself if the occasion weren\xe2\x80\x99t in\r\nits essence the most baited, the most gilded of traps. Baited it could\r\nproperly be called when the repast was of so wise a savour, and gilded\r\nsurrounding objects seemed inevitably to need to be when Miss\r\nBarrace\xe2\x80\x94which was the lady\xe2\x80\x99s name\xe2\x80\x94looked at them with convex Parisian\r\neyes and through a glass with a remarkably long tortoise-shell handle.\r\nWhy Miss Barrace, mature meagre erect and eminently gay, highly\r\nadorned, perfectly familiar, freely contradictious and reminding him of\r\nsome last-century portrait of a clever head without powder\xe2\x80\x94why Miss\r\nBarrace should have been in particular the note of a \xe2\x80\x9ctrap\xe2\x80\x9d Strether\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t on the spot have explained; he blinked in the light of a\r\nconviction that he should know later on, and know well\xe2\x80\x94as it came over\r\nhim, for that matter, with force, that he should need to. He wondered\r\nwhat he was to think exactly of either of his new friends; since the\r\nyoung man, Chad\xe2\x80\x99s intimate and deputy, had, in thus constituting the\r\nscene, practised so much more subtly than he had been prepared for, and\r\nsince in especial Miss Barrace, surrounded clearly by every\r\nconsideration, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t scrupled to figure as a familiar object. It was\r\ninteresting to him to feel that he was in the presence of new measures,\r\nother standards, a different scale of relations, and that evidently\r\nhere were a happy pair who didn\xe2\x80\x99t think of things at all as he and\r\nWaymarsh thought. Nothing was less to have been calculated in the\r\nbusiness than that it should now be for him as if he and Waymarsh were\r\ncomparatively quite at one.\r\n\r\nThe latter was magnificent\xe2\x80\x94this at least was an assurance privately\r\ngiven him by Miss Barrace. \xe2\x80\x9cOh your friend\xe2\x80\x99s a type, the grand old\r\nAmerican\xe2\x80\x94what shall one call it? The Hebrew prophet, Ezekiel, Jeremiah,\r\nwho used when I was a little girl in the Rue Montaigne to come to see\r\nmy father and who was usually the American Minister to the Tuileries or\r\nsome other court. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen one these ever so many years; the\r\nsight of it warms my poor old chilled heart; this specimen is\r\nwonderful; in the right quarter, you know, he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a _succ\xc3\xa8s fou_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nStrether hadn\xe2\x80\x99t failed to ask what the right quarter might be, much as\r\nhe required his presence of mind to meet such a change in their scheme.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh the artist-quarter and that kind of thing; _here_ already, for\r\ninstance, as you see.\xe2\x80\x9d He had been on the point of echoing \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x94is\r\n_this_ the artist-quarter?\xe2\x80\x9d but she had already disposed of the\r\nquestion with a wave of all her tortoise-shell and an easy \xe2\x80\x9cBring him\r\nto _me!_\xe2\x80\x9d He knew on the spot how little he should be able to bring\r\nhim, for the very air was by this time, to his sense, thick and hot\r\nwith poor Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s judgement of it. He was in the trap still more\r\nthan his companion and, unlike his companion, not making the best of\r\nit; which was precisely what doubtless gave him his admirable sombre\r\nglow. Little did Miss Barrace know that what was behind it was his\r\ngrave estimate of her own laxity. The general assumption with which our\r\ntwo friends had arrived had been that of finding Mr. Bilham ready to\r\nconduct them to one or other of those resorts of the earnest, the\r\n\xc3\xa6sthetic fraternity which were shown among the sights of Paris. In this\r\ncharacter it would have justified them in a proper insistence on\r\ndischarging their score. Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s only proviso at the last had been\r\nthat nobody should pay for him; but he found himself, as the occasion\r\ndeveloped, paid for on a scale as to which Strether privately made out\r\nthat he already nursed retribution. Strether was conscious across the\r\ntable of what worked in him, conscious when they passed back to the\r\nsmall salon to which, the previous evening, he himself had made so rich\r\na reference; conscious most of all as they stepped out to the balcony\r\nin which one would have had to be an ogre not to recognise the perfect\r\nplace for easy aftertastes. These things were enhanced for Miss Barrace\r\nby a succession of excellent cigarettes\xe2\x80\x94acknowledged, acclaimed, as a\r\npart of the wonderful supply left behind him by Chad\xe2\x80\x94in an almost equal\r\nabsorption of which Strether found himself blindly, almost wildly\r\npushing forward. He might perish by the sword as well as by famine, and\r\nhe knew that his having abetted the lady by an excess that was rare\r\nwith him would count for little in the sum\xe2\x80\x94as Waymarsh might so easily\r\nadd it up\xe2\x80\x94of her licence. Waymarsh had smoked of old, smoked hugely;\r\nbut Waymarsh did nothing now, and that gave him his advantage over\r\npeople who took things up lightly just when others had laid them\r\nheavily down. Strether had never smoked, and he felt as if he flaunted\r\nat his friend that this had been only because of a reason. The reason,\r\nit now began to appear even to himself, was that he had never had a\r\nlady to smoke with.\r\n\r\nIt was this lady\xe2\x80\x99s being there at all, however, that was the strange\r\nfree thing; perhaps, since she _was_ there, her smoking was the least\r\nof her freedoms. If Strether had been sure at each juncture of\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x94with Bilham in especial\xe2\x80\x94she talked about, he might have traced\r\nothers and winced at them and felt Waymarsh wince; but he was in fact\r\nso often at sea that his sense of the range of reference was merely\r\ngeneral and that he on several different occasions guessed and\r\ninterpreted only to doubt. He wondered what they meant, but there were\r\nthings he scarce thought they could be supposed to mean, and \xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94not\r\n_that!_\xe2\x80\x9d was at the end of most of his ventures. This was the very\r\nbeginning with him of a condition as to which, later on, it will be\r\nseen, he found cause to pull himself up; and he was to remember the\r\nmoment duly as the first step in a process. The central fact of the\r\nplace was neither more nor less, when analysed\xe2\x80\x94and a pressure\r\nsuperficial sufficed\xe2\x80\x94than the fundamental impropriety of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsituation, round about which they thus seemed cynically clustered.\r\nAccordingly, since they took it for granted, they took for granted all\r\nthat was in connexion with it taken for granted at Woollett\xe2\x80\x94matters as\r\nto which, verily, he had been reduced with Mrs. Newsome to the last\r\nintensity of silence. That was the consequence of their being too bad\r\nto be talked about, and was the accompaniment, by the same token, of a\r\ndeep conception of their badness. It befell therefore that when poor\r\nStrether put it to himself that their badness was ultimately, or\r\nperhaps even insolently, what such a scene as the one before him was,\r\nso to speak, built upon, he could scarce shirk the dilemma of reading a\r\nroundabout echo of them into almost anything that came up. This, he was\r\nwell aware, was a dreadful necessity; but such was the stern logic, he\r\ncould only gather, of a relation to the irregular life.\r\n\r\nIt was the way the irregular life sat upon Bilham and Miss Barrace that\r\nwas the insidious, the delicate marvel. He was eager to concede that\r\ntheir relation to it was all indirect, for anything else in him would\r\nhave shown the grossness of bad manners; but the indirectness was none\r\nthe less consonant\xe2\x80\x94_that_ was striking\xe2\x80\x94with a grateful enjoyment of\r\neverything that was Chad\xe2\x80\x99s. They spoke of him repeatedly, invoking his\r\ngood name and good nature, and the worst confusion of mind for Strether\r\nwas that all their mention of him was of a kind to do him honour. They\r\ncommended his munificence and approved his taste, and in doing so sat\r\ndown, as it seemed to Strether, in the very soil out of which these\r\nthings flowered. Our friend\xe2\x80\x99s final predicament was that he himself was\r\nsitting down, for the time, _with_ them, and there was a supreme moment\r\nat which, compared with his collapse, Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s erectness affected him\r\nas really high. One thing was certain\xe2\x80\x94he saw he must make up his mind.\r\nHe must approach Chad, must wait for him, deal with him, master him,\r\nbut he mustn\xe2\x80\x99t dispossess himself of the faculty of seeing things as\r\nthey were. He must bring him to _him_\xe2\x80\x94not go himself, as it were, so\r\nmuch of the way. He must at any rate be clearer as to what\xe2\x80\x94should he\r\ncontinue to do that for convenience\xe2\x80\x94he was still condoning. It was on\r\nthe detail of this quantity\xe2\x80\x94and what could the fact be but\r\nmystifying?\xe2\x80\x94that Bilham and Miss Barrace threw so little light. So\r\nthere they were.\r\n\r\n\r\n II\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Gostrey arrived, at the end of a week, she made him a sign;\r\nhe went immediately to see her, and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t till then that he could\r\nagain close his grasp on the idea of a corrective. This idea however\r\nwas luckily all before him again from the moment he crossed the\r\nthreshold of the little entresol of the Quartier Marb\xc5\x93uf into which she\r\nhad gathered, as she said, picking them up in a thousand flights and\r\nfunny little passionate pounces, the makings of a final nest. He\r\nrecognised in an instant that there really, there only, he should find\r\nthe boon with the vision of which he had first mounted Chad\xe2\x80\x99s stairs.\r\nHe might have been a little scared at the picture of how much more, in\r\nthis place, he should know himself \xe2\x80\x9cin\xe2\x80\x9d hadn\xe2\x80\x99t his friend been on the\r\nspot to measure the amount to his appetite. Her compact and crowded\r\nlittle chambers, almost dusky, as they at first struck him, with\r\naccumulations, represented a supreme general adjustment to\r\nopportunities and conditions. Wherever he looked he saw an old ivory or\r\nan old brocade, and he scarce knew where to sit for fear of a\r\nmisappliance. The life of the occupant struck him of a sudden as more\r\ncharged with possession even than Chad\xe2\x80\x99s or than Miss Barrace\xe2\x80\x99s; wide\r\nas his glimpse had lately become of the empire of \xe2\x80\x9cthings,\xe2\x80\x9d what was\r\nbefore him still enlarged it; the lust of the eyes and the pride of\r\nlife had indeed thus their temple. It was the innermost nook of the\r\nshrine\xe2\x80\x94as brown as a pirate\xe2\x80\x99s cave. In the brownness were glints of\r\ngold; patches of purple were in the gloom; objects all that caught,\r\nthrough the muslin, with their high rarity, the light of the low\r\nwindows. Nothing was clear about them but that they were precious, and\r\nthey brushed his ignorance with their contempt as a flower, in a\r\nliberty taken with him, might have been whisked under his nose. But\r\nafter a full look at his hostess he knew none the less what most\r\nconcerned him. The circle in which they stood together was warm with\r\nlife, and every question between them would live there as nowhere else.\r\nA question came up as soon as they had spoken, for his answer, with a\r\nlaugh, was quickly: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got hold of me!\xe2\x80\x9d Much of their talk\r\non this first occasion was his development of that truth. He was\r\nextraordinarily glad to see her, expressing to her frankly what she\r\nmost showed him, that one might live for years without a blessing\r\nunsuspected, but that to know it at last for no more than three days\r\nwas to need it or miss it for ever. She was the blessing that had now\r\nbecome his need, and what could prove it better than that without her\r\nhe had lost himself?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked with an absence of alarm that, correcting\r\nhim as if he had mistaken the \xe2\x80\x9cperiod\xe2\x80\x9d of one of her pieces, gave him\r\nafresh a sense of her easy movement through the maze he had but begun\r\nto tread. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat in the name of all the Pococks have you managed to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy exactly the wrong thing. I\xe2\x80\x99ve made a frantic friend of little\r\nBilham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh that sort of thing was of the essence of your case and to have been\r\nallowed for from the first.\xe2\x80\x9d And it was only after this that, quite as\r\na minor matter, she asked who in the world little Bilham might be. When\r\nshe learned that he was a friend of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s and living for the time in\r\nChad\xe2\x80\x99s rooms in Chad\xe2\x80\x99s absence, quite as if acting in Chad\xe2\x80\x99s spirit and\r\nserving Chad\xe2\x80\x99s cause, she showed, however, more interest. \xe2\x80\x9cShould you\r\nmind my seeing him? Only once, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh the oftener the better: he\xe2\x80\x99s amusing\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s original.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t shock you?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Gostrey threw out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever in the world! We escape that with a perfection\xe2\x80\x94! I feel it to be\r\nlargely, no doubt, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t half-understand him; but our _modus\r\nvivendi_ isn\xe2\x80\x99t spoiled even by that. You must dine with me to meet\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether went on. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you giving dinners?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94there I am. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll her kindness wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cThat you\xe2\x80\x99re spending too much money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear no\xe2\x80\x94they seem to cost so little. But that I do it to _them_. I\r\nought to hold off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe thought again\xe2\x80\x94she laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe money you must be spending to think\r\nit cheap! But I must be out of it\xe2\x80\x94to the naked eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked for a moment as if she were really failing him. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t meet them?\xe2\x80\x9d It was almost as if she had developed an unexpected\r\npersonal prudence.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cWho are they\xe2\x80\x94first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy little Bilham to begin with.\xe2\x80\x9d He kept back for the moment Miss\r\nBarrace. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Chad\xe2\x80\x94when he comes\xe2\x80\x94you must absolutely see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen then does he come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Bilham has had time to write him, and hear from him about me.\r\nBilham, however,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cwill report favourably\xe2\x80\x94favourably for\r\nChad. That will make him not afraid to come. I want you the more\r\ntherefore, you see, for my bluff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you\xe2\x80\x99ll do yourself for your bluff.\xe2\x80\x9d She was perfectly easy. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the\r\nrate you\xe2\x80\x99ve gone I\xe2\x80\x99m quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cmade one protest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned it over. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you been seeing what there\xe2\x80\x99s to protest\r\nabout?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe let her, with this, however ruefully, have the whole truth. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t yet found a single thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t there any one _with_ him then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the sort I came out about?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether took a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do I know?\r\nAnd what do I care?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and her laughter spread. He was struck in fact by the effect\r\non her of his joke. He saw now how he meant it as a joke. _She_ saw,\r\nhowever, still other things, though in an instant she had hidden them.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got at no facts at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tried to muster them. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, he has a lovely home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh that, in Paris,\xe2\x80\x9d she quickly returned, \xe2\x80\x9cproves nothing. That is\r\nrather it _dis_proves nothing. They may very well, you see, the people\r\nyour mission is concerned with, have done it _for_ him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. And it was on the scene of their doings then that Waymarsh\r\nand I sat guzzling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh if you forbore to guzzle here on scenes of doings,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou might easily die of starvation.\xe2\x80\x9d With which she smiled at him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve worse before you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh I\xe2\x80\x99ve _everything_ before me. But on our hypothesis, you know, they\r\nmust be wonderful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey _are!_\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Gostrey. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not therefore, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cwholly without facts. They\xe2\x80\x99ve _been_, in effect, wonderful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo have got at something comparatively definite appeared at last a\r\nlittle to help\xe2\x80\x94a wave by which moreover, the next moment, recollection\r\nwas washed. \xe2\x80\x9cMy young man does admit furthermore that they\xe2\x80\x99re our\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s great interest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the expression he uses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether more exactly recalled. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94not quite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething more vivid? Less?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had bent, with neared glasses, over a group of articles on a small\r\nstand; and at this he came up. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a mere allusion, but, on the\r\nlookout as I was, it struck me. \xe2\x80\x98Awful, you know, as Chad is\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94those\r\nwere Bilham\xe2\x80\x99s words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Awful, you know\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94? Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and Miss Gostrey turned them over. She\r\nseemed, however, satisfied. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what more do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe glanced once more at a bibelot or two, and everything sent him back.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it _is_ all the same as if they wished to let me have it between\r\nthe eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cQuoi donc?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy what I speak of. The amenity. They can stun you with that as well\r\nas with anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll come round! I must see them each,\xe2\x80\x9d she went\r\non, \xe2\x80\x9cfor myself. I mean Mr. Bilham and Mr. Newsome\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Bilham naturally\r\nfirst. Once only\xe2\x80\x94once for each; that will do. But face to face\xe2\x80\x94for half\r\nan hour. What\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Chad,\xe2\x80\x9d she immediately pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cdoing at Cannes?\r\nDecent men don\xe2\x80\x99t go to Cannes with the\xe2\x80\x94well, with the kind of ladies\r\nyou mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether asked with an interest in decent men that amused\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, elsewhere, but not to Cannes. Cannes is different. Cannes is\r\nbetter. Cannes is best. I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s all people you know\xe2\x80\x94when you do\r\nknow them. And if _he_ does, why that\xe2\x80\x99s different too. He must have\r\ngone alone. She can\xe2\x80\x99t be with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether confessed in his weakness, \xe2\x80\x9cthe least idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThere seemed much in what she said, but he was able after a little to\r\nhelp her to a nearer impression. The meeting with little Bilham took\r\nplace, by easy arrangement, in the great gallery of the Louvre; and\r\nwhen, standing with his fellow visitor before one of the splendid\r\nTitians\xe2\x80\x94the overwhelming portrait of the young man with the\r\nstrangely-shaped glove and the blue-grey eyes\xe2\x80\x94he turned to see the\r\nthird member of their party advance from the end of the waxed and\r\ngilded vista, he had a sense of having at last taken hold. He had\r\nagreed with Miss Gostrey\xe2\x80\x94it dated even from Chester\xe2\x80\x94for a morning at\r\nthe Louvre, and he had embraced independently the same idea as thrown\r\nout by little Bilham, whom he had already accompanied to the museum of\r\nthe Luxembourg. The fusion of these schemes presented no difficulty,\r\nand it was to strike him again that in little Bilham\xe2\x80\x99s company\r\ncontrarieties in general dropped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh he\xe2\x80\x99s all right\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s one of _us!_\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Gostrey, after the first\r\nexchange, soon found a chance to murmur to her companion; and Strether,\r\nas they proceeded and paused and while a quick unanimity between the\r\ntwo appeared to have phrased itself in half a dozen remarks\xe2\x80\x94Strether\r\nknew that he knew almost immediately what she meant, and took it as\r\nstill another sign that he had got his job in hand. This was the more\r\ngrateful to him that he could think of the intelligence now serving him\r\nas an acquisition positively new. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have known even the day\r\nbefore what she meant\xe2\x80\x94that is if she meant, what he assumed, that they\r\nwere intense Americans together. He had just worked round\xe2\x80\x94and with a\r\nsharper turn of the screw than any yet\xe2\x80\x94to the conception of an American\r\nintense as little Bilham was intense. The young man was his first\r\nspecimen; the specimen had profoundly perplexed him; at present however\r\nthere was light. It was by little Bilham\xe2\x80\x99s amazing serenity that he had\r\nat first been affected, but he had inevitably, in his circumspection,\r\nfelt it as the trail of the serpent, the corruption, as he might\r\nconveniently have said, of Europe; whereas the promptness with which it\r\ncame up for Miss Gostrey but as a special little form of the oldest\r\nthing they knew justified it at once to his own vision as well. He\r\nwanted to be able to like his specimen with a clear good conscience,\r\nand this fully permitted it. What had muddled him was precisely the\r\nsmall artist-man\xe2\x80\x99s way\xe2\x80\x94it was so complete\xe2\x80\x94of being more American than\r\nanybody. But it now for the time put Strether vastly at his ease to\r\nhave this view of a new way.\r\n\r\nThe amiable youth then looked out, as it had first struck Strether, at\r\na world in respect to which he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a prejudice. The one our friend\r\nmost instantly missed was the usual one in favour of an occupation\r\naccepted. Little Bilham had an occupation, but it was only an\r\noccupation declined; and it was by his general exemption from alarm,\r\nanxiety or remorse on this score that the impression of his serenity\r\nwas made. He had come out to Paris to paint\xe2\x80\x94to fathom, that is, at\r\nlarge, that mystery; but study had been fatal to him so far as anything\r\n_could_ be fatal, and his productive power faltered in proportion as\r\nhis knowledge grew. Strether had gathered from him that at the moment\r\nof his finding him in Chad\xe2\x80\x99s rooms he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t saved from his shipwreck a\r\nscrap of anything but his beautiful intelligence and his confirmed\r\nhabit of Paris. He referred to these things with an equal fond\r\nfamiliarity, and it was sufficiently clear that, as an outfit, they\r\nstill served him. They were charming to Strether through the hour spent\r\nat the Louvre, where indeed they figured for him as an unseparated part\r\nof the charged iridescent air, the glamour of the name, the splendour\r\nof the space, the colour of the masters. Yet they were present too\r\nwherever the young man led, and the day after the visit to the Louvre\r\nthey hung, in a different walk, about the steps of our party. He had\r\ninvited his companions to cross the river with him, offering to show\r\nthem his own poor place; and his own poor place, which was very poor,\r\ngave to his idiosyncrasies, for Strether\xe2\x80\x94the small sublime indifference\r\nand independences that had struck the latter as fresh\xe2\x80\x94an odd and\r\nengaging dignity. He lived at the end of an alley that went out of an\r\nold short cobbled street, a street that went in turn out of a new long\r\nsmooth avenue\xe2\x80\x94street and avenue and alley having, however, in common a\r\nsort of social shabbiness; and he introduced them to the rather cold\r\nand blank little studio which he had lent to a comrade for the term of\r\nhis elegant absence. The comrade was another ingenuous compatriot, to\r\nwhom he had wired that tea was to await them \xe2\x80\x9cregardless,\xe2\x80\x9d and this\r\nreckless repast, and the second ingenuous compatriot, and the faraway\r\nmakeshift life, with its jokes and its gaps, its delicate daubs and its\r\nthree or four chairs, its overflow of taste and conviction and its lack\r\nof nearly all else\xe2\x80\x94these things wove round the occasion a spell to\r\nwhich our hero unreservedly surrendered.\r\n\r\nHe liked the ingenuous compatriots\xe2\x80\x94for two or three others soon\r\ngathered; he liked the delicate daubs and the free\r\ndiscriminations\xe2\x80\x94involving references indeed, involving enthusiasms and\r\nexecrations that made him, as they said, sit up; he liked above all the\r\nlegend of good-humoured poverty, of mutual accommodation fairly raised\r\nto the romantic, that he soon read into the scene. The ingenuous\r\ncompatriots showed a candour, he thought, surpassing even the candour\r\nof Woollett; they were red-haired and long-legged, they were quaint and\r\nqueer and dear and droll; they made the place resound with the\r\nvernacular, which he had never known so marked as when figuring for the\r\nchosen language, he must suppose, of contemporary art. They twanged\r\nwith a vengeance the \xc3\xa6sthetic lyre\xe2\x80\x94they drew from it wonderful airs.\r\nThis aspect of their life had an admirable innocence; and he looked on\r\noccasion at Maria Gostrey to see to what extent that element reached\r\nher. She gave him however for the hour, as she had given him the\r\nprevious day, no further sign than to show how she dealt with boys;\r\nmeeting them with the air of old Parisian practice that she had for\r\nevery one, for everything, in turn. Wonderful about the delicate daubs,\r\nmasterful about the way to make tea, trustful about the legs of chairs\r\nand familiarly reminiscent of those, in the other time, the named, the\r\nnumbered or the caricatured, who had flourished or failed, disappeared\r\nor arrived, she had accepted with the best grace her second course of\r\nlittle Bilham, and had said to Strether, the previous afternoon on his\r\nleaving them, that, since her impression was to be renewed, she would\r\nreserve judgement till after the new evidence.\r\n\r\nThe new evidence was to come, as it proved, in a day or two. He soon\r\nhad from Maria a message to the effect that an excellent box at the\r\nFran\xc3\xa7ais had been lent her for the following night; it seeming on such\r\noccasions not the least of her merits that she was subject to such\r\napproaches. The sense of how she was always paying for something in\r\nadvance was equalled on Strether\xe2\x80\x99s part only by the sense of how she\r\nwas always being paid; all of which made for his consciousness, in the\r\nlarger air, of a lively bustling traffic, the exchange of such values\r\nas were not for him to handle. She hated, he knew, at the French play,\r\nanything but a box\xe2\x80\x94just as she hated at the English anything but a\r\nstall; and a box was what he was already in this phase girding himself\r\nto press upon her. But she had for that matter her community with\r\nlittle Bilham: she too always, on the great issues, showed as having\r\nknown in time. It made her constantly beforehand with him and gave him\r\nmainly the chance to ask himself how on the day of their settlement\r\ntheir account would stand. He endeavoured even now to keep it a little\r\nstraight by arranging that if he accepted her invitation she should\r\ndine with him first; but the upshot of this scruple was that at eight\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock on the morrow he awaited her with Waymarsh under the pillared\r\nportico. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t dined with him, and it was characteristic of their\r\nrelation that she had made him embrace her refusal without in the least\r\nunderstanding it. She ever caused her rearrangements to affect him as\r\nher tenderest touches. It was on that principle for instance that,\r\ngiving him the opportunity to be amiable again to little Bilham, she\r\nhad suggested his offering the young man a seat in their box. Strether\r\nhad dispatched for this purpose a small blue missive to the Boulevard\r\nMalesherbes, but up to the moment of their passing into the theatre he\r\nhad received no response to his message. He held, however, even after\r\nthey had been for some time conveniently seated, that their friend, who\r\nknew his way about, would come in at his own right moment. His\r\ntemporary absence moreover seemed, as never yet, to make the right\r\nmoment for Miss Gostrey. Strether had been waiting till tonight to get\r\nback from her in some mirrored form her impressions and conclusions.\r\nShe had elected, as they said, to see little Bilham once; but now she\r\nhad seen him twice and had nevertheless not said more than a word.\r\n\r\nWaymarsh meanwhile sat opposite him with their hostess between; and\r\nMiss Gostrey spoke of herself as an instructor of youth introducing her\r\nlittle charges to a work that was one of the glories of literature. The\r\nglory was happily unobjectionable, and the little charges were candid;\r\nfor herself she had travelled that road and she merely waited on their\r\ninnocence. But she referred in due time to their absent friend, whom it\r\nwas clear they should have to give up. \xe2\x80\x9cHe either won\xe2\x80\x99t have got your\r\nnote,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cor you won\xe2\x80\x99t have got his: he has had some kind of\r\nhindrance, and, of course, for that matter, you know, a man never\r\nwrites about coming to a box.\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke as if, with her look, it might\r\nhave been Waymarsh who had written to the youth, and the latter\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nshowed a mixture of austerity and anguish. She went on however as if to\r\nmeet this. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s far and away, you know, the best of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe best of whom, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy of all the long procession\xe2\x80\x94the boys, the girls, or the old men and\r\nold women as they sometimes really are; the hope, as one may say, of\r\nour country. They\xe2\x80\x99ve all passed, year after year; but there has been no\r\none in particular I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever wanted to stop. I feel\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t _you?_\xe2\x80\x94that I\r\nwant to stop little Bilham; he\xe2\x80\x99s so exactly right as he is.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\ncontinued to talk to Waymarsh. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s too delightful. If he\xe2\x80\x99ll only not\r\nspoil it! But they always _will_; they always do; they always have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think Waymarsh knows,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether said after a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cquite\r\nwhat it\xe2\x80\x99s open to Bilham to spoil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be a good American,\xe2\x80\x9d Waymarsh lucidly enough replied; \xe2\x80\x9cfor it\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t strike me the young man had developed much in _that_ shape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Gostrey sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cthe name of the good American is as easily\r\ngiven as taken away! What _is_ it, to begin with, to _be_ one, and\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the extraordinary hurry? Surely nothing that\xe2\x80\x99s so pressing was\r\never so little defined. It\xe2\x80\x99s such an order, really, that before we cook\r\nyou the dish we must at least have your receipt. Besides the poor\r\nchicks have time! What I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen so often spoiled,\xe2\x80\x9d she pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nthe happy attitude itself, the state of faith and\xe2\x80\x94what shall I call\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x94the sense of beauty. You\xe2\x80\x99re right about him\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she now took in\r\nStrether; \xe2\x80\x9clittle Bilham has them to a charm, we must keep little\r\nBilham along.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she was all again for Waymarsh. \xe2\x80\x9cThe others have\r\nall wanted so dreadfully to do something, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve gone and done it\r\nin too many cases indeed. It leaves them never the same afterwards; the\r\ncharm\xe2\x80\x99s always somehow broken. Now _he_, I think, you know, really\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t. He won\xe2\x80\x99t do the least dreadful little thing. We shall continue\r\nto enjoy him just as he is. No\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s quite beautiful. He sees\r\neverything. He isn\xe2\x80\x99t a bit ashamed. He has every scrap of the courage\r\nof it that one could ask. Only think what he _might_ do. One wants\r\nreally\xe2\x80\x94for fear of some accident\xe2\x80\x94to keep him in view. At this very\r\nmoment perhaps what mayn\xe2\x80\x99t he be up to? I\xe2\x80\x99ve had my disappointments\xe2\x80\x94the\r\npoor things are never really safe; or only at least when you have them\r\nunder your eye. One can never completely trust them. One\xe2\x80\x99s uneasy, and\r\nI think that\xe2\x80\x99s why I most miss him now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had wound up with a laugh of enjoyment over her embroidery of her\r\nidea\xe2\x80\x94an enjoyment that her face communicated to Strether, who almost\r\nwished none the less at this moment that she would let poor Waymarsh\r\nalone. _He_ knew more or less what she meant; but the fact wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nreason for her not pretending to Waymarsh that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. It was craven\r\nof him perhaps, but he would, for the high amenity of the occasion,\r\nhave liked Waymarsh not to be so sure of his wit. Her recognition of it\r\ngave him away and, before she had done with him or with that article,\r\nwould give him worse. What was he, all the same, to do? He looked\r\nacross the box at his friend; their eyes met; something queer and\r\nstiff, something that bore on the situation but that it was better not\r\nto touch, passed in silence between them. Well, the effect of it for\r\nStrether was an abrupt reaction, a final impatience of his own tendency\r\nto temporise. Where was that taking him anyway? It was one of the quiet\r\ninstants that sometimes settle more matters than the outbreaks dear to\r\nthe historic muse. The only qualification of the quietness was the\r\nsynthetic \xe2\x80\x9cOh hang it!\xe2\x80\x9d into which Strether\xe2\x80\x99s share of the silence\r\nsoundlessly flowered. It represented, this mute ejaculation, a final\r\nimpulse to burn his ships. These ships, to the historic muse, may seem\r\nof course mere cockles, but when he presently spoke to Miss Gostrey it\r\nwas with the sense at least of applying the torch. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it then a\r\nconspiracy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetween the two young men? Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to be a seer or a\r\nprophetess,\xe2\x80\x9d she presently replied; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if I\xe2\x80\x99m simply a woman of sense\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s working for you to-night. I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite know how\xe2\x80\x94but it\xe2\x80\x99s in my\r\nbones.\xe2\x80\x9d And she looked at him at last as if, little material as she yet\r\ngave him, he\xe2\x80\x99d really understand. \xe2\x80\x9cFor an opinion _that\xe2\x80\x99s_ my opinion.\r\nHe makes you out too well not to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to work for me to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I hope he isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndoing anything very bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve got you,\xe2\x80\x9d she portentously answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean he _is_\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve got you,\xe2\x80\x9d she merely repeated. Though she disclaimed the\r\nprophetic vision she was at this instant the nearest approach he had\r\never met to the priestess of the oracle. The light was in her eyes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must face it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe faced it on the spot. \xe2\x80\x9cThey _had_ arranged\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery move in the game. And they\xe2\x80\x99ve been arranging ever since. He has\r\nhad every day his little telegram from Cannes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt made Strether open his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you _know_ that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do better. I see it. This was, before I met him, what I wondered\r\nwhether I _was_ to see. But as soon as I met him I ceased to wonder,\r\nand our second meeting made me sure. I took him all in. He was\r\nacting\xe2\x80\x94he is still\xe2\x80\x94on his daily instructions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that Chad has done the whole thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94not the whole. _We\xe2\x80\x99ve_ done some of it. You and I and \xe2\x80\x98Europe.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEurope\xe2\x80\x94yes,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether mused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear old Paris,\xe2\x80\x9d she seemed to explain. But there was more, and, with\r\none of her turns, she risked it. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd dear old Waymarsh. You,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ndeclared, \xe2\x80\x9chave been a good bit of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat massive. \xe2\x80\x9cA good bit of what, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy of the wonderful consciousness of our friend here. You\xe2\x80\x99ve helped\r\ntoo in your way to float him to where he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where the devil _is_ he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe passed it on with a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere the devil, Strether, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke as if he had just been thinking it out. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, quite already\r\nin Chad\xe2\x80\x99s hands, it would seem.\xe2\x80\x9d And he had had with this another\r\nthought. \xe2\x80\x9cWill that be\xe2\x80\x94just all through Bilham\xe2\x80\x94the way he\xe2\x80\x99s going to\r\nwork it? It would be, for him, you know, an idea. And Chad with an\r\nidea\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked while the image held him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, is Chad\xe2\x80\x94what shall I say?\xe2\x80\x94monstrous?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh as much as you like! But the idea you speak of,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave been his best. He\xe2\x80\x99ll have a better. It won\xe2\x80\x99t be all through little\r\nBilham that he\xe2\x80\x99ll work it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis already sounded almost like a hope destroyed. \xe2\x80\x9cThrough whom else\r\nthen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what we shall see!\xe2\x80\x9d But quite as she spoke she turned, and\r\nStrether turned; for the door of the box had opened, with the click of\r\nthe _ouvreuse_, from the lobby, and a gentleman, a stranger to them,\r\nhad come in with a quick step. The door closed behind him, and, though\r\ntheir faces showed him his mistake, his air, which was striking, was\r\nall good confidence. The curtain had just again arisen, and, in the\r\nhush of the general attention, Strether\xe2\x80\x99s challenge was tacit, as was\r\nalso the greeting, with a quickly deprecating hand and smile, of the\r\nunannounced visitor. He discreetly signed that he would wait, would\r\nstand, and these things and his face, one look from which she had\r\ncaught, had suddenly worked for Miss Gostrey. She fitted to them all an\r\nanswer for Strether\xe2\x80\x99s last question. The solid stranger was simply the\r\nanswer\xe2\x80\x94as she now, turning to her friend, indicated. She brought it\r\nstraight out for him\xe2\x80\x94it presented the intruder. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, through this\r\ngentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d The gentleman indeed, at the same time, though sounding for\r\nStrether a very short name, did practically as much to explain.\r\nStrether gasped the name back\xe2\x80\x94then only had he seen Miss Gostrey had\r\nsaid more than she knew. They were in presence of Chad himself.\r\n\r\nOur friend was to go over it afterwards again and again\xe2\x80\x94he was going\r\nover it much of the time that they were together, and they were\r\ntogether constantly for three or four days: the note had been so\r\nstrongly struck during that first half-hour that everything happening\r\nsince was comparatively a minor development. The fact was that his\r\nperception of the young man\xe2\x80\x99s identity\xe2\x80\x94so absolutely checked for a\r\nminute\xe2\x80\x94had been quite one of the sensations that count in life; he\r\ncertainly had never known one that had acted, as he might have said,\r\nwith more of a crowded rush. And the rush though both vague and\r\nmultitudinous, had lasted a long time, protected, as it were, yet at\r\nthe same time aggravated, by the circumstance of its coinciding with a\r\nstretch of decorous silence. They couldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk without disturbing the\r\nspectators in the part of the balcony just below them; and it, for that\r\nmatter, came to Strether\xe2\x80\x94being a thing of the sort that did come to\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94that these were the accidents of a high civilisation; the imposed\r\ntribute to propriety, the frequent exposure to conditions, usually\r\nbrilliant, in which relief has to await its time. Relief was never\r\nquite near at hand for kings, queens, comedians and other such people,\r\nand though you might be yourself not exactly one of those, you could\r\nyet, in leading the life of high pressure, guess a little how they\r\nsometimes felt. It was truly the life of high pressure that Strether\r\nhad seemed to feel himself lead while he sat there, close to Chad,\r\nduring the long tension of the act. He was in presence of a fact that\r\noccupied his whole mind, that occupied for the half-hour his senses\r\nthemselves all together; but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t without inconvenience show\r\nanything\xe2\x80\x94which moreover might count really as luck. What he might have\r\nshown, had he shown at all, was exactly the kind of emotion\xe2\x80\x94the emotion\r\nof bewilderment\xe2\x80\x94that he had proposed to himself from the first,\r\nwhatever should occur, to show least. The phenomenon that had suddenly\r\nsat down there with him was a phenomenon of change so complete that his\r\nimagination, which had worked so beforehand, felt itself, in the\r\nconnexion, without margin or allowance. It had faced every contingency\r\nbut that Chad should not _be_ Chad, and this was what it now had to\r\nface with a mere strained smile and an uncomfortable flush.\r\n\r\nHe asked himself if, by any chance, before he should have in some way\r\nto commit himself, he might feel his mind settled to the new vision,\r\nmight habituate it, so to speak, to the remarkable truth. But oh it was\r\ntoo remarkable, the truth; for what could be more remarkable than this\r\nsharp rupture of an identity? You could deal with a man as himself\xe2\x80\x94you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t deal with him as somebody else. It was a small source of peace\r\nmoreover to be reduced to wondering how little he might know in such an\r\nevent what a sum he was setting you. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t absolutely not know,\r\nfor you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t absolutely not let him. It was a _case_ then simply, a\r\nstrong case, as people nowadays called such things, a case of\r\ntransformation unsurpassed, and the hope was but in the general law\r\nthat strong cases were liable to control from without. Perhaps he,\r\nStrether himself, was the only person after all aware of it. Even Miss\r\nGostrey, with all her science, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be, would she?\xe2\x80\x94and he had never\r\nseen any one less aware of anything than Waymarsh as he glowered at\r\nChad. The social sightlessness of his old friend\xe2\x80\x99s survey marked for\r\nhim afresh, and almost in an humiliating way, the inevitable limits of\r\ndirect aid from this source. He was not certain, however, of not\r\ndrawing a shade of compensation from the privilege, as yet untasted, of\r\nknowing more about something in particular than Miss Gostrey did. His\r\nsituation too was a case, for that matter, and he was now so\r\ninterested, quite so privately agog, about it, that he had already an\r\neye to the fun it would be to open up to her afterwards. He derived\r\nduring his half-hour no assistance from her, and just this fact of her\r\nnot meeting his eyes played a little, it must be confessed, into his\r\npredicament.\r\n\r\nHe had introduced Chad, in the first minutes, under his breath, and\r\nthere was never the primness in her of the person unacquainted; but she\r\nhad none the less betrayed at first no vision but of the stage, where\r\nshe occasionally found a pretext for an appreciative moment that she\r\ninvited Waymarsh to share. The latter\xe2\x80\x99s faculty of participation had\r\nnever had, all round, such an assault to meet; the pressure on him\r\nbeing the sharper for this chosen attitude in her, as Strether judged\r\nit, of isolating, for their natural intercourse, Chad and himself. This\r\nintercourse was meanwhile restricted to a frank friendly look from the\r\nyoung man, something markedly like a smile, but falling far short of a\r\ngrin, and to the vivacity of Strether\xe2\x80\x99s private speculation as to\r\nwhether _he_ carried himself like a fool. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite see how he\r\ncould so feel as one without somehow showing as one. The worst of that\r\nquestion moreover was that he knew it as a symptom the sense of which\r\nannoyed him. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be odiously conscious of how I may strike\r\nthe fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected, \xe2\x80\x9cit was so little what I came out for that I\r\nmay as well stop before I begin.\xe2\x80\x9d This sage consideration too,\r\ndistinctly, seemed to leave untouched the fact that he _was_ going to\r\nbe conscious. He was conscious of everything but of what would have\r\nserved him.\r\n\r\nHe was to know afterwards, in the watches of the night, that nothing\r\nwould have been more open to him than after a minute or two to propose\r\nto Chad to seek with him the refuge of the lobby. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t only not\r\nproposed it, but had lacked even the presence of mind to see it as\r\npossible. He had stuck there like a schoolboy wishing not to miss a\r\nminute of the show; though for that portion of the show then presented\r\nhe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had an instant\xe2\x80\x99s real attention. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t when the curtain\r\nfell have given the slightest account of what had happened. He had\r\ntherefore, further, not at that moment acknowledged the amenity added\r\nby this acceptance of his awkwardness to Chad\xe2\x80\x99s general patience.\r\nHadn\xe2\x80\x99t he none the less known at the very time\xe2\x80\x94known it stupidly and\r\nwithout reaction\xe2\x80\x94that the boy was accepting something? He was modestly\r\nbenevolent, the boy\xe2\x80\x94that was at least what he had been capable of the\r\nsuperiority of making out his chance to be; and one had one\xe2\x80\x99s self\r\nliterally not had the gumption to get in ahead of him. If we should go\r\ninto all that occupied our friend in the watches of the night we should\r\nhave to mend our pen; but an instance or two may mark for us the\r\nvividness with which he could remember. He remembered the two\r\nabsurdities that, if his presence of mind _had_ failed, were the things\r\nthat had had most to do with it. He had never in his life seen a young\r\nman come into a box at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night, and would, if challenged\r\non the question in advance, have scarce been ready to pronounce as to\r\ndifferent ways of doing so. But it was in spite of this definite to him\r\nthat Chad had had a way that was wonderful: a fact carrying with it an\r\nimplication that, as one might imagine it, he knew, he had learned,\r\nhow.\r\n\r\nHere already then were abounding results; he had on the spot and\r\nwithout the least trouble of intention taught Strether that even in so\r\nsmall a thing as that there were different ways. He had done in the\r\nsame line still more than this; had by a mere shake or two of the head\r\nmade his old friend observe that the change in him was perhaps more\r\nthan anything else, for the eye, a matter of the marked streaks of\r\ngrey, extraordinary at his age, in his thick black hair; as well as\r\nthat this new feature was curiously becoming to him, did something for\r\nhim, as characterisation, also even\xe2\x80\x94of all things in the world\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nrefinement, that had been a good deal wanted. Strether felt, however,\r\nhe would have had to confess, that it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been easy just now,\r\non this and other counts, in the presence of what had been supplied, to\r\nbe quite clear as to what had been missed. A reflexion a candid critic\r\nmight have made of old, for instance, was that it would have been\r\nhappier for the son to look more like the mother; but this was a\r\nreflexion that at present would never occur. The ground had quite\r\nfallen away from it, yet no resemblance whatever to the mother had\r\nsupervened. It would have been hard for a young man\xe2\x80\x99s face and air to\r\ndisconnect themselves more completely than Chad\xe2\x80\x99s at this juncture from\r\nany discerned, from any imaginable aspect of a New England female\r\nparent. That of course was no more than had been on the cards; but it\r\nproduced in Strether none the less one of those frequent phenomena of\r\nmental reference with which all judgement in him was actually beset.\r\n\r\nAgain and again as the days passed he had had a sense of the pertinence\r\nof communicating quickly with Woollett\xe2\x80\x94communicating with a quickness\r\nwith which telegraphy alone would rhyme; the fruit really of a fine\r\nfancy in him for keeping things straight, for the happy forestalment of\r\nerror. No one could explain better when needful, nor put more\r\nconscience into an account or a report; which burden of conscience is\r\nperhaps exactly the reason why his heart always sank when the clouds of\r\nexplanation gathered. His highest ingenuity was in keeping the sky of\r\nlife clear of them. Whether or no he had a grand idea of the lucid, he\r\nheld that nothing ever was in fact\xe2\x80\x94for any one else\xe2\x80\x94explained. One went\r\nthrough the vain motions, but it was mostly a waste of life. A personal\r\nrelation was a relation only so long as people either perfectly\r\nunderstood or, better still, didn\xe2\x80\x99t care if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t. From the\r\nmoment they cared if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t it was living by the sweat of one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrow; and the sweat of one\xe2\x80\x99s brow was just what one might buy one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nself off from by keeping the ground free of the wild weed of delusion.\r\nIt easily grew too fast, and the Atlantic cable now alone could race\r\nwith it. That agency would each day have testified for him to something\r\nthat was not what Woollett had argued. He was not at this moment\r\nabsolutely sure that the effect of the morrow\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94or rather of the\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94appreciation of the crisis wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be to determine some brief\r\nmissive. \xe2\x80\x9cHave at last seen him, but oh dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94some temporary relief of\r\nthat sort seemed to hover before him. It hovered somehow as preparing\r\nthem all\xe2\x80\x94yet preparing them for what? If he might do so more luminously\r\nand cheaply he would tick out in four words: \xe2\x80\x9cAwfully old\xe2\x80\x94grey hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nTo this particular item in Chad\xe2\x80\x99s appearance he constantly, during\r\ntheir mute half-hour, reverted; as if so very much more than he could\r\nhave said had been involved in it. The most he could have said would\r\nhave been: \xe2\x80\x9cIf he\xe2\x80\x99s going to make me feel young\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d which indeed,\r\nhowever, carried with it quite enough. If Strether was to feel young,\r\nthat is, it would be because Chad was to feel old; and an aged and\r\nhoary sinner had been no part of the scheme.\r\n\r\nThe question of Chadwick\xe2\x80\x99s true time of life was, doubtless, what came\r\nup quickest after the adjournment of the two, when the play was over,\r\nto a caf\xc3\xa9 in the Avenue de l\xe2\x80\x99Op\xc3\xa9ra. Miss Gostrey had in due course been\r\nperfect for such a step; she had known exactly what they wanted\xe2\x80\x94to go\r\nstraight somewhere and talk; and Strether had even felt she had known\r\nwhat he wished to say and that he was arranging immediately to begin.\r\nShe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t pretended this, as she _had_ pretended on the other hand, to\r\nhave divined Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s wish to extend to her an independent protection\r\nhomeward; but Strether nevertheless found how, after he had Chad\r\nopposite to him at a small table in the brilliant halls that his\r\ncompanion straightway selected, sharply and easily discriminated from\r\nothers, it was quite, to his mind, as if she heard him speak; as if,\r\nsitting up, a mile away, in the little apartment he knew, she would\r\nlisten hard enough to catch. He found too that he liked that idea, and\r\nhe wished that, by the same token, Mrs. Newsome might have caught as\r\nwell. For what had above all been determined in him as a necessity of\r\nthe first order was not to lose another hour, nor a fraction of one;\r\nwas to advance, to overwhelm, with a rush. This was how he would\r\nanticipate\xe2\x80\x94by a night-attack, as might be\xe2\x80\x94any forced maturity that a\r\ncrammed consciousness of Paris was likely to take upon itself to assert\r\non behalf of the boy. He knew to the full, on what he had just\r\nextracted from Miss Gostrey, Chad\xe2\x80\x99s marks of alertness; but they were a\r\nreason the more for not dawdling. If he was himself moreover to be\r\ntreated as young he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t at all events be so treated before he\r\nshould have struck out at least once. His arms might be pinioned\r\nafterwards, but it would have been left on record that he was fifty.\r\nThe importance of this he had indeed begun to feel before they left the\r\ntheatre; it had become a wild unrest, urging him to seize his chance.\r\nHe could scarcely wait for it as they went; he was on the verge of the\r\nindecency of bringing up the question in the street; he fairly caught\r\nhimself going on\xe2\x80\x94so he afterwards invidiously named it\xe2\x80\x94as if there\r\nwould be for him no second chance should the present be lost. Not till,\r\non the purple divan before the perfunctory _bock_, he had brought out\r\nthe words themselves, was he sure, for that matter, that the present\r\nwould be saved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook Fourth\r\n\r\n\r\n I\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve come, you know, to make you break with everything, neither more\r\nnor less, and take you straight home; so you\xe2\x80\x99ll be so good as\r\nimmediately and favourably to consider it!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Strether, face to face with\r\nChad after the play, had sounded these words almost breathlessly, and\r\nwith an effect at first positively disconcerting to himself alone. For\r\nChad\xe2\x80\x99s receptive attitude was that of a person who had been gracefully\r\nquiet while the messenger at last reaching him has run a mile through\r\nthe dust. During some seconds after he had spoken Strether felt as if\r\n_he_ had made some such exertion; he was not even certain that the\r\nperspiration wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on his brow. It was the kind of consciousness for\r\nwhich he had to thank the look that, while the strain lasted, the young\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes gave him. They reflected\xe2\x80\x94and the deuce of the thing was that\r\nthey reflected really with a sort of shyness of kindness\xe2\x80\x94his\r\nmomentarily disordered state; which fact brought on in its turn for our\r\nfriend the dawn of a fear that Chad might simply \xe2\x80\x9ctake it out\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94take\r\neverything out\xe2\x80\x94in being sorry for him. Such a fear, any fear, was\r\nunpleasant. But everything was unpleasant; it was odd how everything\r\nhad suddenly turned so. This however was no reason for letting the\r\nleast thing go. Strether had the next minute proceeded as roundly as if\r\nwith an advantage to follow up. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I\xe2\x80\x99m a busybody, if you want\r\nto fight the case to the death; but after all mainly in the sense of\r\nhaving known you and having given you such attention as you kindly\r\npermitted when you were in jackets and knickerbockers. Yes\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nknickerbockers, I\xe2\x80\x99m busybody enough to remember that; and that you had,\r\nfor your age\xe2\x80\x94I speak of the first far-away time\xe2\x80\x94tremendously stout\r\nlegs. Well, we want you to break. Your mother\xe2\x80\x99s heart\xe2\x80\x99s passionately\r\nset upon it, but she has above and beyond that excellent arguments and\r\nreasons. I\xe2\x80\x99ve not put them into her head\xe2\x80\x94I needn\xe2\x80\x99t remind you how\r\nlittle she\xe2\x80\x99s a person who needs that. But they exist\xe2\x80\x94you must take it\r\nfrom me as a friend both of hers and yours\xe2\x80\x94for myself as well. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ninvent them, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t originally work them out; but I understand them,\r\nI think I can explain them\xe2\x80\x94by which I mean make you actively do them\r\njustice; and that\xe2\x80\x99s why you see me here. You had better know the worst\r\nat once. It\xe2\x80\x99s a question of an immediate rupture and an immediate\r\nreturn. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been conceited enough to dream I can sugar that pill. I\r\ntake at any rate the greatest interest in the question. I took it\r\nalready before I left home, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind telling you that, altered\r\nas you are, I take it still more now that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you. You\xe2\x80\x99re older\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to call it!\xe2\x80\x94more of a handful; but you\xe2\x80\x99re by so\r\nmuch the more, I seem to make out, to our purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I strike you as improved?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether was to recall that Chad had at\r\nthis point enquired.\r\n\r\nHe was likewise to recall\xe2\x80\x94and it had to count for some time as his\r\ngreatest comfort\xe2\x80\x94that it had been \xe2\x80\x9cgiven\xe2\x80\x9d him, as they said at\r\nWoollett, to reply with some presence of mind: \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t the least\r\nidea.\xe2\x80\x9d He was really for a while to like thinking he had been\r\npositively hard. On the point of conceding that Chad had improved in\r\nappearance, but that to the question of appearance the remark must be\r\nconfined, he checked even that compromise and left his reservation\r\nbare. Not only his moral, but also, as it were, his \xc3\xa6sthetic sense had\r\na little to pay for this, Chad being unmistakeably\xe2\x80\x94and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it a\r\nmatter of the confounded grey hair again?\xe2\x80\x94handsomer than he had ever\r\npromised. That however fell in perfectly with what Strether had said.\r\nThey had no desire to keep down his proper expansion, and he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe less to their purpose for not looking, as he had too often done of\r\nold, only bold and wild. There was indeed a signal particular in which\r\nhe would distinctly be more so. Strether didn\xe2\x80\x99t, as he talked,\r\nabsolutely follow himself; he only knew he was clutching his thread and\r\nthat he held it from moment to moment a little tighter; his mere\r\nuninterruptedness during the few minutes helped him to do that. He had\r\nfrequently for a month, turned over what he should say on this very\r\noccasion, and he seemed at last to have said nothing he had thought\r\nof\xe2\x80\x94everything was so totally different.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of all he had put the flag at the window. This was what he\r\nhad done, and there was a minute during which he affected himself as\r\nhaving shaken it hard, flapped it with a mighty flutter, straight in\r\nfront of his companion\xe2\x80\x99s nose. It gave him really almost the sense of\r\nhaving already acted his part. The momentary relief\xe2\x80\x94as if from the\r\nknowledge that nothing of _that_ at least could be undone\xe2\x80\x94sprang from a\r\nparticular cause, the cause that had flashed into operation, in Miss\r\nGostrey\xe2\x80\x99s box, with direct apprehension, with amazed recognition, and\r\nthat had been concerned since then in every throb of his consciousness.\r\nWhat it came to was that with an absolutely _new_ quantity to deal with\r\none simply couldn\xe2\x80\x99t know. The new quantity was represented by the fact\r\nthat Chad had been made over. That was all; whatever it was it was\r\neverything. Strether had never seen the thing so done before\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nperhaps a speciality of Paris. If one had been present at the process\r\none might little by little have mastered the result; but he was face to\r\nface, as matters stood, with the finished business. It had freely been\r\nnoted for him that he might be received as a dog among skittles, but\r\nthat was on the basis of the old quantity. He had originally thought of\r\nlines and tones as things to be taken, but these possibilities had now\r\nquite melted away. There was no computing at all what the young man\r\nbefore him would think or feel or say on any subject whatever. This\r\nintelligence Strether had afterwards, to account for his nervousness,\r\nreconstituted as he might, just as he had also reconstituted the\r\npromptness with which Chad had corrected his uncertainty. An\r\nextraordinarily short time had been required for the correction, and\r\nthere had ceased to be anything negative in his companion\xe2\x80\x99s face and\r\nair as soon as it was made. \xe2\x80\x9cYour engagement to my mother has become\r\nthen what they call here a _fait accompli?_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it had consisted, the\r\ndeterminant touch, in nothing more than that.\r\n\r\nWell, that was enough, Strether had felt while his answer hung fire. He\r\nhad felt at the same time, however, that nothing could less become him\r\nthan that it should hang fire too long. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said brightly, \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nwas on the happy settlement of the question that I started. You see\r\ntherefore to what tune I\xe2\x80\x99m in your family. Moreover,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen supposing you\xe2\x80\x99d suppose it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99ve been supposing it for a long time, and what you tell me helps\r\nme to understand that you should want to do something. To do something,\r\nI mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chad, \xe2\x80\x9cto commemorate an event so\xe2\x80\x94what do they call\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x94so auspicious. I see you make out, and not unnaturally,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat bringing me home in triumph as a sort of\r\nwedding-present to Mother would commemorate it better than anything\r\nelse. You want to make a bonfire in fact,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cand you pitch\r\nme on. Thank you, thank you!\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed again.\r\n\r\nHe was altogether easy about it, and this made Strether now see how at\r\nbottom, and in spite of the shade of shyness that really cost him\r\nnothing, he had from the first moment been easy about everything. The\r\nshade of shyness was mere good taste. People with manners formed could\r\napparently have, as one of their best cards, the shade of shyness too.\r\nHe had leaned a little forward to speak; his elbows were on the table;\r\nand the inscrutable new face that he had got somewhere and somehow was\r\nbrought by the movement nearer to his critic\xe2\x80\x99s. There was a fascination\r\nfor that critic in its not being, this ripe physiognomy, the face that,\r\nunder observation at least, he had originally carried away from\r\nWoollett. Strether found a certain freedom on his own side in defining\r\nit as that of a man of the world\xe2\x80\x94a formula that indeed seemed to come\r\nnow in some degree to his relief; that of a man to whom things had\r\nhappened and were variously known. In gleams, in glances, the past did\r\nperhaps peep out of it; but such lights were faint and instantly\r\nmerged. Chad was brown and thick and strong, and of old Chad had been\r\nrough. Was all the difference therefore that he was actually smooth?\r\nPossibly; for that he _was_ smooth was as marked as in the taste of a\r\nsauce or in the rub of a hand. The effect of it was general\xe2\x80\x94it had\r\nretouched his features, drawn them with a cleaner line. It had cleared\r\nhis eyes and settled his colour and polished his fine square teeth\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nmain ornament of his face; and at the same time that it had given him a\r\nform and a surface, almost a design, it had toned his voice,\r\nestablished his accent, encouraged his smile to more play and his other\r\nmotions to less. He had formerly, with a great deal of action,\r\nexpressed very little; and he now expressed whatever was necessary with\r\nalmost none at all. It was as if in short he had really, copious\r\nperhaps but shapeless, been put into a firm mould and turned\r\nsuccessfully out. The phenomenon\xe2\x80\x94Strether kept eyeing it as a\r\nphenomenon, an eminent case\xe2\x80\x94was marked enough to be touched by the\r\nfinger. He finally put his hand across the table and laid it on Chad\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narm. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ll promise me\xe2\x80\x94here on the spot and giving me your word of\r\nhonour\xe2\x80\x94to break straight off, you\xe2\x80\x99ll make the future the real right\r\nthing for all of us alike. You\xe2\x80\x99ll ease off the strain of this decent\r\nbut none the less acute suspense in which I\xe2\x80\x99ve for so many days been\r\nwaiting for you, and let me turn in to rest. I shall leave you with my\r\nblessing and go to bed in peace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad again fell back at this and, his hands pocketed, settled himself a\r\nlittle; in which posture he looked, though he rather anxiously smiled,\r\nonly the more earnest. Then Strether seemed to see that he was really\r\nnervous, and he took that as what he would have called a wholesome\r\nsign. The only mark of it hitherto had been his more than once taking\r\noff and putting on his wide-brimmed crush hat. He had at this moment\r\nmade the motion again to remove it, then had only pushed it back, so\r\nthat it hung informally on his strong young grizzled crop. It was a\r\ntouch that gave the note of the familiar\xe2\x80\x94the intimate and the\r\nbelated\xe2\x80\x94to their quiet colloquy; and it was indeed by some such trivial\r\naid that Strether became aware at the same moment of something else.\r\nThe observation was at any rate determined in him by some light too\r\nfine to distinguish from so many others, but it was none the less\r\nsharply determined. Chad looked unmistakeably during these\r\ninstants\xe2\x80\x94well, as Strether put it to himself, all he was worth. Our\r\nfriend had a sudden apprehension of what that would on certain sides\r\nbe. He saw him in a flash as the young man marked out by women; and for\r\na concentrated minute the dignity, the comparative austerity, as he\r\nfunnily fancied it, of this character affected him almost with awe.\r\nThere was an experience on his interlocutor\xe2\x80\x99s part that looked out at\r\nhim from under the displaced hat, and that looked out moreover by a\r\nforce of its own, the deep fact of its quantity and quality, and not\r\nthrough Chad\xe2\x80\x99s intending bravado or swagger. That was then the way men\r\nmarked out by women _were_\xe2\x80\x94and also the men by whom the women were\r\ndoubtless in turn sufficiently distinguished. It affected Strether for\r\nthirty seconds as a relevant truth, a truth which, however, the next\r\nminute, had fallen into its relation. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you imagine there being\r\nsome questions,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad asked, \xe2\x80\x9cthat a fellow\xe2\x80\x94however much impressed by\r\nyour charming way of stating things\xe2\x80\x94would like to put to you first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94easily. I\xe2\x80\x99m here to answer everything. I think I can even tell\r\nyou things, of the greatest interest to you, that you won\xe2\x80\x99t know enough\r\nto ask me. We\xe2\x80\x99ll take as many days to it as you like. But I want,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nStrether wound up, \xe2\x80\x9cto go to bed now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad had spoken in such surprise that he was amused. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you believe\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x94with what you put me through?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man seemed to consider. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I haven\xe2\x80\x99t put you through\r\nmuch\xe2\x80\x94yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean there\xe2\x80\x99s so much more to come?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the\r\nmore reason then that I should gird myself.\xe2\x80\x9d And as if to mark what he\r\nfelt he could by this time count on he was already on his feet.\r\n\r\nChad, still seated, stayed him, with a hand against him, as he passed\r\nbetween their table and the next. \xe2\x80\x9cOh we shall get on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tone was, as who should say, everything Strether could have\r\ndesired; and quite as good the expression of face with which the\r\nspeaker had looked up at him and kindly held him. All these things\r\nlacked was their not showing quite so much as the fruit of experience.\r\nYes, experience was what Chad did play on him, if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t play any\r\ngrossness of defiance. Of course experience was in a manner defiance;\r\nbut it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, at any rate\xe2\x80\x94rather indeed quite the contrary!\xe2\x80\x94grossness;\r\nwhich was so much gained. He fairly grew older, Strether thought, while\r\nhe himself so reasoned. Then with his mature pat of his visitor\xe2\x80\x99s arm\r\nhe also got up; and there had been enough of it all by this time to\r\nmake the visitor feel that something _was_ settled. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it settled\r\nthat he had at least the testimony of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s own belief in a\r\nsettlement? Strether found himself treating Chad\xe2\x80\x99s profession that they\r\nwould get on as a sufficient basis for going to bed. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nnevertheless after this gone to bed directly; for when they had again\r\npassed out together into the mild bright night a check had virtually\r\nsprung from nothing more than a small circumstance which might have\r\nacted only as confirming quiescence. There were people, expressive\r\nsound, projected light, still abroad, and after they had taken in for a\r\nmoment, through everything, the great clear architectural street, they\r\nturned off in tacit union to the quarter of Strether\xe2\x80\x99s hotel. \xe2\x80\x9cOf\r\ncourse,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad here abruptly began, \xe2\x80\x9cof course Mother\xe2\x80\x99s making things\r\nout with you about me has been natural\xe2\x80\x94and of course also you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a\r\ngood deal to go upon. Still, you must have filled out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had stopped, leaving his friend to wonder a little what point he\r\nwished to make; and this it was that enabled Strether meanwhile to make\r\none. \xe2\x80\x9cOh we\xe2\x80\x99ve never pretended to go into detail. We weren\xe2\x80\x99t in the\r\nleast bound to _that_. It was \xe2\x80\x98filling out\xe2\x80\x99 enough to miss you as we\r\ndid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Chad rather oddly insisted, though under the high lamp at their\r\ncorner, where they paused, he had at first looked as if touched by\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s allusion to the long sense, at home, of his absence. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I\r\nmean is you must have imagined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImagined what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94horrors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt affected Strether: horrors were so little\xe2\x80\x94superficially at least\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nthis robust and reasoning image. But he was none the less there to be\r\nveracious. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I dare say we _have_ imagined horrors. But where\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nharm if we haven\xe2\x80\x99t been wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad raised his face to the lamp, and it was one of the moments at\r\nwhich he had, in his extraordinary way, most his air of designedly\r\nshowing himself. It was as if at these instants he just presented\r\nhimself, his identity so rounded off, his palpable presence and his\r\nmassive young manhood, as such a link in the chain as might practically\r\namount to a kind of demonstration. It was as if\xe2\x80\x94and how but\r\nanomalously?\xe2\x80\x94he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t after all help thinking sufficiently well of\r\nthese things to let them go for what they were worth. What could there\r\nbe in this for Strether but the hint of some self-respect, some sense\r\nof power, oddly perverted; something latent and beyond access, ominous\r\nand perhaps enviable? The intimation had the next thing, in a flash,\r\ntaken on a name\xe2\x80\x94a name on which our friend seized as he asked himself\r\nif he weren\xe2\x80\x99t perhaps really dealing with an irreducible young Pagan.\r\nThis description\xe2\x80\x94he quite jumped at it\xe2\x80\x94had a sound that gratified his\r\nmental ear, so that of a sudden he had already adopted it. Pagan\xe2\x80\x94yes,\r\nthat was, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it? what Chad _would_ logically be. It was what he\r\nmust be. It was what he was. The idea was a clue and, instead of\r\ndarkening the prospect, projected a certain clearness. Strether made\r\nout in this quick ray that a Pagan was perhaps, at the pass they had\r\ncome to, the thing most wanted at Woollett. They\xe2\x80\x99d be able to do with\r\none\xe2\x80\x94a good one; he\xe2\x80\x99d find an opening\xe2\x80\x94yes; and Strether\xe2\x80\x99s imagination\r\neven now prefigured and accompanied the first appearance there of the\r\nrousing personage. He had only the slight discomfort of feeling, as the\r\nyoung man turned away from the lamp, that his thought had in the\r\nmomentary silence possibly been guessed. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nChad, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve come near enough. The details, as you say, don\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\r\nIt _has_ been generally the case that I\xe2\x80\x99ve let myself go. But I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ncoming round\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m not so bad now.\xe2\x80\x9d With which they walked on again to\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s hotel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d the latter asked as they approached the door, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nthere isn\xe2\x80\x99t any woman with you now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut pray what has that to do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy it\xe2\x80\x99s the whole question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf my going home?\xe2\x80\x9d Chad was clearly surprised. \xe2\x80\x9cOh not much! Do you\r\nthink that when I want to go any one will have any power\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo keep you\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Strether took him straight up\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfrom carrying out your\r\nwish? Well, our idea has been that somebody has hitherto\xe2\x80\x94or a good many\r\npersons perhaps\xe2\x80\x94kept you pretty well from \xe2\x80\x98wanting.\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re in anybody\xe2\x80\x99s hands\xe2\x80\x94may again happen. You don\xe2\x80\x99t answer my\r\nquestion\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he kept it up; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t in anybody\xe2\x80\x99s hands so much\r\nthe better. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing then but what makes for your going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad turned this over. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t answer your question?\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke quite\r\nwithout resenting it. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, such questions have always a rather\r\nexaggerated side. One doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know quite what you mean by being in\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98hands.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s all so vague. One is when one isn\xe2\x80\x99t. One isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwhen one is. And then one can\xe2\x80\x99t quite give people away.\xe2\x80\x9d He seemed\r\nkindly to explain. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve _never_ got stuck\xe2\x80\x94so very hard; and, as\r\nagainst anything at any time really better, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever\r\nbeen afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d There was something in it that held Strether to wonder,\r\nand this gave him time to go on. He broke out as with a more helpful\r\nthought. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know how I like Paris itself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe upshot was indeed to make our friend marvel. \xe2\x80\x9cOh if _that\xe2\x80\x99s_ all\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d It was _he_ who almost showed resentment.\r\n\r\nChad\xe2\x80\x99s smile of a truth more than met it. \xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t that enough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether hesitated, but it came out. \xe2\x80\x9cNot enough for your mother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSpoken, however, it sounded a trifle odd\xe2\x80\x94the effect of which was that\r\nChad broke into a laugh. Strether, at this, succumbed as well, though\r\nwith extreme brevity. \xe2\x80\x9cPermit us to have still our theory. But if you\r\n_are_ so free and so strong you\xe2\x80\x99re inexcusable. I\xe2\x80\x99ll write in the\r\nmorning,\xe2\x80\x9d he added with decision. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll say I\xe2\x80\x99ve got you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis appeared to open for Chad a new interest. \xe2\x80\x9cHow often do you\r\nwrite?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh perpetually.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd at great length?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether had become a little impatient. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope it\xe2\x80\x99s not found too\r\ngreat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99m sure not. And you hear as often?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Strether paused. \xe2\x80\x9cAs often as I deserve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother writes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chad, \xe2\x80\x9ca lovely letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether, before the closed _porte-coch\xc3\xa8re_, fixed him a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmore, my boy, than _you_ do! But our suppositions don\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99re actually not entangled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad\xe2\x80\x99s pride seemed none the less a little touched. \xe2\x80\x9cI never _was_\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94let me insist. I always had my own way.\xe2\x80\x9d With which he pursued:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have it at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what are you here for? What has kept you,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether asked, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nyou _have_ been able to leave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt made Chad, after a stare, throw himself back. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nkept only by women?\xe2\x80\x9d His surprise and his verbal emphasis rang out so\r\nclear in the still street that Strether winced till he remembered the\r\nsafety of their English speech. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man demanded,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat they think at Woollett?\xe2\x80\x9d At the good faith in the question\r\nStrether had changed colour, feeling that, as he would have said, he\r\nhad put his foot in it. He had appeared stupidly to misrepresent what\r\nthey thought at Woollett; but before he had time to rectify Chad again\r\nwas upon him. \xe2\x80\x9cI must say then you show a low mind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt so fell in, unhappily for Strether, with that reflexion of his own\r\nprompted in him by the pleasant air of the Boulevard Malesherbes, that\r\nits disconcerting force was rather unfairly great. It was a dig that,\r\nadministered by himself\xe2\x80\x94and administered even to poor Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x94was\r\nno more than salutary; but administered by Chad\xe2\x80\x94and quite logically\xe2\x80\x94it\r\ncame nearer drawing blood. They _hadn\xe2\x80\x99t_ a low mind\xe2\x80\x94nor any approach to\r\none; yet incontestably they had worked, and with a certain smugness, on\r\na basis that might be turned against them. Chad had at any rate pulled\r\nhis visitor up; he had even pulled up his admirable mother; he had\r\nabsolutely, by a turn of the wrist and a jerk of the far-flung noose,\r\npulled up, in a bunch, Woollett browsing in its pride. There was no\r\ndoubt Woollett _had_ insisted on his coarseness; and what he at present\r\nstood there for in the sleeping street was, by his manner of striking\r\nthe other note, to make of such insistence a preoccupation compromising\r\nto the insisters. It was exactly as if they had imputed to him a\r\nvulgarity that he had by a mere gesture caused to fall from him. The\r\ndevil of the case was that Strether felt it, by the same stroke, as\r\nfalling straight upon himself. He had been wondering a minute ago if\r\nthe boy weren\xe2\x80\x99t a Pagan, and he found himself wondering now if he\r\nweren\xe2\x80\x99t by chance a gentleman. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t in the least, on the spot,\r\nspring up helpfully for him that a person couldn\xe2\x80\x99t at the same time be\r\nboth. There was nothing at this moment in the air to challenge the\r\ncombination; there was everything to give it on the contrary something\r\nof a flourish. It struck Strether into the bargain as doing something\r\nto meet the most difficult of the questions; though perhaps indeed only\r\nby substituting another. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be precisely by having learned to\r\nbe a gentleman that he had mastered the consequent trick of looking so\r\nwell that one could scarce speak to him straight? But what in the world\r\nwas the clue to such a prime producing cause? There were too many clues\r\nthen that Strether still lacked, and these clues to clues were among\r\nthem. What it accordingly amounted to for him was that he had to take\r\nfull in the face a fresh attribution of ignorance. He had grown used by\r\nthis time to reminders, especially from his own lips, of what he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow; but he had borne them because in the first place they were\r\nprivate and because in the second they practically conveyed a tribute.\r\nHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what was bad, and\xe2\x80\x94as others didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how little he\r\nknew it\xe2\x80\x94he could put up with his state. But if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know, in so\r\nimportant a particular, what was good, Chad at least was now aware he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t; and that, for some reason, affected our friend as curiously\r\npublic. It was in fact an exposed condition that the young man left him\r\nin long enough for him to feel its chill\xe2\x80\x94till he saw fit, in a word,\r\ngenerously again to cover him. This last was in truth what Chad quite\r\ngracefully did. But he did it as with a simple thought that met the\r\nwhole of the case. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99m all right!\xe2\x80\x9d It was what Strether had rather\r\nbewilderedly to go to bed on.\r\n\r\n\r\n II\r\n\r\nIt really looked true moreover from the way Chad was to behave after\r\nthis. He was full of attentions to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s ambassador; in spite of\r\nwhich, all the while, the latter\xe2\x80\x99s other relations rather remarkably\r\ncontrived to assert themselves. Strether\xe2\x80\x99s sittings pen in hand with\r\nMrs. Newsome up in his own room were broken, yet they were richer; and\r\nthey were more than ever interspersed with the hours in which he\r\nreported himself, in a different fashion, but with scarce less\r\nearnestness and fulness, to Maria Gostrey. Now that, as he would have\r\nexpressed it, he had really something to talk about he found himself,\r\nin respect to any oddity that might reside for him in the double\r\nconnexion, at once more aware and more indifferent. He had been fine to\r\nMrs. Newsome about his useful friend, but it had begun to haunt his\r\nimagination that Chad, taking up again for her benefit a pen too long\r\ndisused, might possibly be finer. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t at all do, he saw, that\r\nanything should come up for him at Chad\xe2\x80\x99s hand but what specifically\r\n_was_ to have come; the greatest divergence from which would be\r\nprecisely the element of any lubrication of their intercourse by\r\nlevity. It was accordingly to forestall such an accident that he\r\nfrankly put before the young man the several facts, just as they had\r\noccurred, of his funny alliance. He spoke of these facts, pleasantly\r\nand obligingly, as \xe2\x80\x9cthe whole story,\xe2\x80\x9d and felt that he might qualify\r\nthe alliance as funny if he remained sufficiently grave about it. He\r\nflattered himself that he even exaggerated the wild freedom of his\r\noriginal encounter with the wonderful lady; he was scrupulously\r\ndefinite about the absurd conditions in which they had made\r\nacquaintance\xe2\x80\x94their having picked each other up almost in the street;\r\nand he had (finest inspiration of all!) a conception of carrying the\r\nwar into the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s country by showing surprise at the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\nHe had always had a notion that this last was the grand style of\r\nfighting; the greater therefore the reason for it, as he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nremember that he had ever before fought in the grand style. Every one,\r\naccording to this, knew Miss Gostrey: how came it Chad didn\xe2\x80\x99t know her?\r\nThe difficulty, the impossibility, was really to escape it; Strether\r\nput on him, by what he took for granted, the burden of proof of the\r\ncontrary. This tone was so far successful as that Chad quite appeared\r\nto recognise her as a person whose fame had reached him, but against\r\nhis acquaintance with whom much mischance had worked. He made the point\r\nat the same time that his social relations, such as they could be\r\ncalled, were perhaps not to the extent Strether supposed with the\r\nrising flood of their compatriots. He hinted at his having more and\r\nmore given way to a different principle of selection; the moral of\r\nwhich seemed to be that he went about little in the \xe2\x80\x9ccolony.\xe2\x80\x9d For the\r\nmoment certainly he had quite another interest. It was deep, what he\r\nunderstood, and Strether, for himself, could only so observe it. He\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see as yet how deep. Might he not all too soon! For there was\r\nreally too much of their question that Chad had already committed\r\nhimself to liking. He liked, to begin with, his prospective stepfather;\r\nwhich was distinctly what had not been on the cards. His hating him was\r\nthe untowardness for which Strether had been best prepared; he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexpected the boy\xe2\x80\x99s actual form to give him more to do than his imputed.\r\nIt gave him more through suggesting that he must somehow make up to\r\nhimself for not being sure he was sufficiently disagreeable. That had\r\nreally been present to him as his only way to be sure he was\r\nsufficiently thorough. The point was that if Chad\xe2\x80\x99s tolerance of his\r\nthoroughness were insincere, were but the best of devices for gaining\r\ntime, it none the less did treat everything as tacitly concluded.\r\n\r\nThat seemed at the end of ten days the upshot of the abundant, the\r\nrecurrent talk through which Strether poured into him all it concerned\r\nhim to know, put him in full possession of facts and figures. Never\r\ncutting these colloquies short by a minute, Chad behaved, looked and\r\nspoke as if he were rather heavily, perhaps even a trifle gloomily, but\r\nnone the less fundamentally and comfortably free. He made no crude\r\nprofession of eagerness to yield, but he asked the most intelligent\r\nquestions, probed, at moments, abruptly, even deeper than his friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlayer of information, justified by these touches the native estimate of\r\nhis latent stuff, and had in every way the air of trying to live,\r\nreflectively, into the square bright picture. He walked up and down in\r\nfront of this production, sociably took Strether\xe2\x80\x99s arm at the points at\r\nwhich he stopped, surveyed it repeatedly from the right and from the\r\nleft, inclined a critical head to either quarter, and, while he puffed\r\na still more critical cigarette, animadverted to his companion on this\r\npassage and that. Strether sought relief\xe2\x80\x94there were hours when he\r\nrequired it\xe2\x80\x94in repeating himself; it was in truth not to be blinked\r\nthat Chad had a way. The main question as yet was of what it was a way\r\n_to_. It made vulgar questions no more easy; but that was unimportant\r\nwhen all questions save those of his own asking had dropped. That he\r\nwas free was answer enough, and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite ridiculous that this\r\nfreedom should end by presenting itself as what was difficult to move.\r\nHis changed state, his lovely home, his beautiful things, his easy\r\ntalk, his very appetite for Strether, insatiable and, when all was\r\nsaid, flattering\xe2\x80\x94what were such marked matters all but the notes of his\r\nfreedom? He had the effect of making a sacrifice of it just in these\r\nhandsome forms to his visitor; which was mainly the reason the visitor\r\nwas privately, for the time, a little out of countenance. Strether was\r\nat this period again and again thrown back on a felt need to remodel\r\nsomehow his plan. He fairly caught himself shooting rueful glances, shy\r\nlooks of pursuit, toward the embodied influence, the definite\r\nadversary, who had by a stroke of her own failed him and on a fond\r\ntheory of whose palpable presence he had, under Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninspiration, altogether proceeded. He had once or twice, in secret,\r\nliterally expressed the irritated wish that _she_ would come out and\r\nfind her.\r\n\r\nHe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite yet force it upon Woollett that such a career, such a\r\nperverted young life, showed after all a certain plausible side, _did_\r\nin the case before them flaunt something like an impunity for the\r\nsocial man; but he could at least treat himself to the statement that\r\nwould prepare him for the sharpest echo. This echo\xe2\x80\x94as distinct over\r\nthere in the dry thin air as some shrill \xe2\x80\x9cheading\xe2\x80\x9d above a column of\r\nprint\xe2\x80\x94seemed to reach him even as he wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cHe says there\xe2\x80\x99s no woman,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe could hear Mrs. Newsome report, in capitals almost of newspaper\r\nsize, to Mrs. Pocock; and he could focus in Mrs. Pocock the response of\r\nthe reader of the journal. He could see in the younger lady\xe2\x80\x99s face the\r\nearnestness of her attention and catch the full scepticism of her but\r\nslightly delayed \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is there then?\xe2\x80\x9d Just so he could again as little\r\nmiss the mother\xe2\x80\x99s clear decision: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of disposition, no\r\ndoubt, to pretend there isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d Strether had, after posting his letter,\r\nthe whole scene out; and it was a scene during which, coming and going,\r\nas befell, he kept his eye not least upon the daughter. He had his fine\r\nsense of the conviction Mrs. Pocock would take occasion to reaffirm\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nconviction bearing, as he had from the first deeply divined it to bear,\r\non Mr. Strether\xe2\x80\x99s essential inaptitude. She had looked him in his\r\nconscious eyes even before he sailed, and that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe _he_\r\nwould find the woman had been written in her book. Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t she at the\r\nbest but a scant faith in his ability to find women? It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even as\r\nif he had found her mother\xe2\x80\x94so much more, to her discrimination, had her\r\nmother performed the finding. Her mother had, in a case her private\r\njudgement of which remained educative of Mrs. Pocock\xe2\x80\x99s critical sense,\r\nfound the man. The man owed his unchallenged state, in general, to the\r\nfact that Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s discoveries were accepted at Woollett; but he\r\nknew in his bones, our friend did, how almost irresistibly Mrs. Pocock\r\nwould now be moved to show what she thought of his own. Give _her_ a\r\nfree hand, would be the moral, and the woman would soon be found.\r\n\r\nHis impression of Miss Gostrey after her introduction to Chad was\r\nmeanwhile an impression of a person almost unnaturally on her guard. He\r\nstruck himself as at first unable to extract from her what he wished;\r\nthough indeed _of_ what he wished at this special juncture he would\r\ndoubtless have contrived to make but a crude statement. It sifted and\r\nsettled nothing to put to her, _tout b\xc3\xaatement_, as she often said, \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou like him, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94thanks to his feeling it actually the least of his\r\nneeds to heap up the evidence in the young man\xe2\x80\x99s favour. He repeatedly\r\nknocked at her door to let her have it afresh that Chad\xe2\x80\x99s case\xe2\x80\x94whatever\r\nelse of minor interest it might yield\xe2\x80\x94was first and foremost a miracle\r\nalmost monstrous. It was the alteration of the entire man, and was so\r\nsignal an instance that nothing else, for the intelligent observer,\r\ncould\xe2\x80\x94_could_ it?\xe2\x80\x94signify. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a plot,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s more in\r\nit than meets the eye.\xe2\x80\x9d He gave the rein to his fancy. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a plant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis fancy seemed to please her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhose then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the party responsible is, I suppose, the fate that waits for\r\none, the dark doom that rides. What I mean is that with such elements\r\none can\xe2\x80\x99t count. I\xe2\x80\x99ve but my poor individual, my modest human means. It\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t playing the game to turn on the uncanny. All one\xe2\x80\x99s energy goes to\r\nfacing it, to tracking it. One wants, confound it, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nconfessed with a queer face\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cone wants to enjoy anything so rare. Call\r\nit then life\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he puzzled it out\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccall it poor dear old life simply that\r\nsprings the surprise. Nothing alters the fact that the surprise is\r\nparalysing, or at any rate engrossing\xe2\x80\x94all, practically, hang it, that\r\none sees, that one _can_ see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer silences were never barren, nor even dull. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that what you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nwritten home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tossed it off. \xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had another pause while, across her carpets, he had another walk.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t look out you\xe2\x80\x99ll have them straight over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh but I\xe2\x80\x99ve said he\xe2\x80\x99ll go back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd _will_ he?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Gostrey asked.\r\n\r\nThe special tone of it made him, pulling up, look at her long. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthat but just the question I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent treasures of patience and\r\ningenuity in giving _you_, by the sight of him\xe2\x80\x94after everything had led\r\nup\xe2\x80\x94every facility to answer? What is it but just the thing I came here\r\nto-day to get out of you? Will he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94he won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe air of it held him. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99ve all the while known\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve known nothing but what I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen; and I wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared\r\nwith some impatience, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you didn\xe2\x80\x99t see as much. It was enough to be\r\nwith him there\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the box? Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he rather blankly urged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94to feel sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure of what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe got up from her chair, at this, with a nearer approach than she had\r\never yet shown to dismay at his dimness. She even, fairly pausing for\r\nit, spoke with a shade of pity. \xe2\x80\x9cGuess!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a shade, fairly, that brought a flush into his face; so that for\r\na moment, as they waited together, their difference was between them.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that just your hour with him told you so much of his story?\r\nVery good; I\xe2\x80\x99m not such a fool, on my side, as that I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand\r\nyou, or as that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t in some degree understand _him_. That he has\r\ndone what he liked most isn\xe2\x80\x99t, among any of us, a matter the least in\r\ndispute. There\xe2\x80\x99s equally little question at this time of day of what it\r\nis he does like most. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking,\xe2\x80\x9d he reasonably explained,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cof any mere wretch he may still pick up. I\xe2\x80\x99m talking of some person\r\nwho in his present situation may have held her own, may really have\r\ncounted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what _I_ am!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Gostrey. But she as quickly\r\nmade her point. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you thought\xe2\x80\x94or that they think at\r\nWoollett\xe2\x80\x94that that\xe2\x80\x99s what mere wretches necessarily do. Mere wretches\r\nnecessarily _don\xe2\x80\x99t!_\xe2\x80\x9d she declared with spirit. \xe2\x80\x9cThere must, behind\r\nevery appearance to the contrary, still be somebody\xe2\x80\x94somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\na mere wretch, since we accept the miracle. What else but such a\r\nsomebody can such a miracle be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took it in. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause the fact itself _is_ the woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_A_ woman. Some woman or other. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the things that _have_ to\r\nbe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you mean then at least a good one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good woman?\xe2\x80\x9d She threw up her arms with a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI should call her\r\nexcellent!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why does he deny her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey thought a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause she\xe2\x80\x99s too good to admit! Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou see,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9chow she accounts for him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether clearly, more and more, did see; yet it made him also see\r\nother things. \xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t what we want that he shall account for _her?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he does. What you have before you is his way. You must forgive\r\nhim if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite outspoken. In Paris such debts are tacit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether could imagine; but still\xe2\x80\x94! \xe2\x80\x9cEven when the woman\xe2\x80\x99s good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain she laughed out. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, and even when the man is! There\xe2\x80\x99s always a\r\ncaution in such cases,\xe2\x80\x9d she more seriously explained\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfor what it may\r\nseem to show. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that\xe2\x80\x99s taken as showing so much here as\r\nsudden unnatural goodness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh then you\xe2\x80\x99re speaking now,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether said, \xe2\x80\x9cof people who are _not_\r\nnice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI delight,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cin your classifications. But do you want\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cto give you in the matter, on this ground, the wisest\r\nadvice I\xe2\x80\x99m capable of? Don\xe2\x80\x99t consider her, don\xe2\x80\x99t judge her at all in\r\nherself. Consider her and judge her only in Chad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had the courage at least of his companion\xe2\x80\x99s logic. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause then I\r\nshall like her?\xe2\x80\x9d He almost looked, with his quick imagination as if he\r\nalready did, though seeing at once also the full extent of how little\r\nit would suit his book. \xe2\x80\x9cBut is that what I came out for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had to confess indeed that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. But there was something else.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make up your mind. There are all sorts of things. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseen him all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis on his side Strether recognised; but his acuteness none the less\r\nshowed him the danger. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, but if the more I see the better he\r\nseems?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, she found something. \xe2\x80\x9cThat may be\xe2\x80\x94but his disavowal of her isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nall the same, pure consideration. There\xe2\x80\x99s a hitch.\xe2\x80\x9d She made it out.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the effort to sink her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether winced at the image. \xe2\x80\x9cTo \xe2\x80\x98sink\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I mean there\xe2\x80\x99s a struggle, and a part of it is just what he\r\nhides. Take time\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the only way not to make some mistake that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll regret. Then you\xe2\x80\x99ll see. He does really want to shake her off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur friend had by this time so got into the vision that he almost\r\ngasped. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all she has done for him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey gave him a look which broke the next moment into a\r\nwonderful smile. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not so good as you think!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey remained with him, these words, promising him, in their character\r\nof warning, considerable help; but the support he tried to draw from\r\nthem found itself on each renewal of contact with Chad defeated by\r\nsomething else. What could it be, this disconcerting force, he asked\r\nhimself, but the sense, constantly renewed, that Chad _was_\xe2\x80\x94quite in\r\nfact insisted on being\xe2\x80\x94as good as he thought? It seemed somehow as if\r\nhe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t _but_ be as good from the moment he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as bad. There\r\nwas a succession of days at all events when contact with him\xe2\x80\x94and in its\r\nimmediate effect, as if it could produce no other\xe2\x80\x94elbowed out of\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s consciousness everything but itself. Little Bilham once more\r\npervaded the scene, but little Bilham became even in a higher degree\r\nthan he had originally been one of the numerous forms of the inclusive\r\nrelation; a consequence promoted, to our friend\xe2\x80\x99s sense, by two or\r\nthree incidents with which we have yet to make acquaintance. Waymarsh\r\nhimself, for the occasion, was drawn into the eddy; it absolutely,\r\nthough but temporarily, swallowed him down, and there were days when\r\nStrether seemed to bump against him as a sinking swimmer might brush a\r\nsubmarine object. The fathomless medium held them\xe2\x80\x94Chad\xe2\x80\x99s manner was the\r\nfathomless medium; and our friend felt as if they passed each other, in\r\ntheir deep immersion, with the round impersonal eye of silent fish. It\r\nwas practically produced between them that Waymarsh was giving him then\r\nhis chance; and the shade of discomfort that Strether drew from the\r\nallowance resembled not a little the embarrassment he had known at\r\nschool, as a boy, when members of his family had been present at\r\nexhibitions. He could perform before strangers, but relatives were\r\nfatal, and it was now as if, comparatively, Waymarsh were a relative.\r\nHe seemed to hear him say \xe2\x80\x9cStrike up then!\xe2\x80\x9d and to enjoy a foretaste of\r\nconscientious domestic criticism. He _had_ struck up, so far as he\r\nactually could; Chad knew by this time in profusion what he wanted; and\r\nwhat vulgar violence did his fellow pilgrim expect of him when he had\r\nreally emptied his mind? It went somehow to and fro that what poor\r\nWaymarsh meant was \xe2\x80\x9cI told you so\xe2\x80\x94that you\xe2\x80\x99d lose your immortal soul!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbut it was also fairly explicit that Strether had his own challenge and\r\nthat, since they must go to the bottom of things, he wasted no more\r\nvirtue in watching Chad than Chad wasted in watching him. His dip for\r\nduty\xe2\x80\x99s sake\xe2\x80\x94where was it worse than Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s own? For _he_ needn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave stopped resisting and refusing, needn\xe2\x80\x99t have parleyed, at that\r\nrate, with the foe.\r\n\r\nThe strolls over Paris to see something or call somewhere were\r\naccordingly inevitable and natural, and the late sessions in the\r\nwondrous troisi\xc3\xa8me, the lovely home, when men dropped in and the\r\npicture composed more suggestively through the haze of tobacco, of\r\nmusic more or less good and of talk more or less polyglot, were on a\r\nprinciple not to be distinguished from that of the mornings and the\r\nafternoons. Nothing, Strether had to recognise as he leaned back and\r\nsmoked, could well less resemble a scene of violence than even the\r\nliveliest of these occasions. They were occasions of discussion, none\r\nthe less, and Strether had never in his life heard so many opinions on\r\nso many subjects. There were opinions at Woollett, but only on three or\r\nfour. The differences were there to match; if they were doubtless deep,\r\nthough few, they were quiet\xe2\x80\x94they were, as might be said, almost as shy\r\nas if people had been ashamed of them. People showed little diffidence\r\nabout such things, on the other hand, in the Boulevard Malesherbes, and\r\nwere so far from being ashamed of them\xe2\x80\x94or indeed of anything else\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nthey often seemed to have invented them to avert those agreements that\r\ndestroy the taste of talk. No one had ever done that at Woollett,\r\nthough Strether could remember times when he himself had been tempted\r\nto it without quite knowing why. He saw why at present\xe2\x80\x94he had but\r\nwanted to promote intercourse.\r\n\r\nThese, however, were but parenthetic memories, and the turn taken by\r\nhis affair on the whole was positively that if his nerves were on the\r\nstretch it was because he missed violence. When he asked himself if\r\nnone would then, in connexion with it, ever come at all, he might\r\nalmost have passed as wondering how to provoke it. It would be too\r\nabsurd if such a vision as _that_ should have to be invoked for relief;\r\nit was already marked enough as absurd that he should actually have\r\nbegun with flutters and dignities on the score of a single accepted\r\nmeal. What sort of a brute had he expected Chad to be, anyway?\xe2\x80\x94Strether\r\nhad occasion to make the enquiry but was careful to make it in private.\r\nHe could himself, comparatively recent as it was\xe2\x80\x94it was truly but the\r\nfact of a few days since\xe2\x80\x94focus his primal crudity; but he would on the\r\napproach of an observer, as if handling an illicit possession, have\r\nslipped the reminiscence out of sight. There were echoes of it still in\r\nMrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s letters, and there were moments when these echoes made\r\nhim exclaim on her want of tact. He blushed of course, at once, still\r\nmore for the explanation than for the ground of it: it came to him in\r\ntime to save his manners that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t at the best become tactful\r\nas quickly as he. Her tact had to reckon with the Atlantic Ocean, the\r\nGeneral Post-Office and the extravagant curve of the globe. Chad had\r\none day offered tea at the Boulevard Malesherbes to a chosen few, a\r\ngroup again including the unobscured Miss Barrace; and Strether had on\r\ncoming out walked away with the acquaintance whom in his letters to\r\nMrs. Newsome he always spoke of as the little artist-man. He had had\r\nfull occasion to mention him as the other party, so oddly, to the only\r\nclose personal alliance observation had as yet detected in Chad\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexistence. Little Bilham\xe2\x80\x99s way this afternoon was not Strether\xe2\x80\x99s, but\r\nhe had none the less kindly come with him, and it was somehow a part of\r\nhis kindness that as it had sadly begun to rain they suddenly found\r\nthemselves seated for conversation at a caf\xc3\xa9 in which they had taken\r\nrefuge. He had passed no more crowded hour in Chad\xe2\x80\x99s society than the\r\none just ended; he had talked with Miss Barrace, who had reproached him\r\nwith not having come to see her, and he had above all hit on a happy\r\nthought for causing Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s tension to relax. Something might\r\npossibly be extracted for the latter from the idea of his success with\r\nthat lady, whose quick apprehension of what might amuse her had given\r\nStrether a free hand. What had she meant if not to ask whether she\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help him with his splendid encumbrance, and mightn\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\nsacred rage at any rate be kept a little in abeyance by thus creating\r\nfor his comrade\xe2\x80\x99s mind even in a world of irrelevance the possibility\r\nof a relation? What was it but a relation to be regarded as so\r\ndecorative and, in especial, on the strength of it, to be whirled away,\r\namid flounces and feathers, in a coup\xc3\xa9 lined, by what Strether could\r\nmake out, with dark blue brocade? He himself had never been whirled\r\naway\xe2\x80\x94never at least in a coup\xc3\xa9 and behind a footman; he had driven with\r\nMiss Gostrey in cabs, with Mrs. Pocock, a few times, in an open buggy,\r\nwith Mrs. Newsome in a four-seated cart and, occasionally up at the\r\nmountains, on a buckboard; but his friend\xe2\x80\x99s actual adventure\r\ntranscended his personal experience. He now showed his companion soon\r\nenough indeed how inadequate, as a general monitor, this last queer\r\nquantity could once more feel itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat game under the sun is he playing?\xe2\x80\x9d He signified the next moment\r\nthat his allusion was not to the fat gentleman immersed in dominoes on\r\nwhom his eyes had begun by resting, but to their host of the previous\r\nhour, as to whom, there on the velvet bench, with a final collapse of\r\nall consistency, he treated himself to the comfort of indiscretion.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you see him come out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham, in meditation, looked at him with a kindness almost\r\npaternal. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you like it over here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether laughed out\xe2\x80\x94for the tone was indeed droll; he let himself go.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has that to do with it? The only thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve any business to like\r\nis to feel that I\xe2\x80\x99m moving him. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I ask you whether you\r\nbelieve I _am?_ Is the creature\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he did his best to show that he\r\nsimply wished to ascertain\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chonest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion looked responsible, but looked it through a small dim\r\nsmile. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat creature do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was on this that they did have for a little a mute interchange. \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nit untrue that he\xe2\x80\x99s free? How then,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether asked wondering \xe2\x80\x9cdoes he\r\narrange his life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the creature you mean Chad himself?\xe2\x80\x9d little Bilham said.\r\n\r\nStrether here, with a rising hope, just thought, \xe2\x80\x9cWe must take one of\r\nthem at a time.\xe2\x80\x9d But his coherence lapsed. \xe2\x80\x9c_Is_ there some woman? Of\r\nwhom he\xe2\x80\x99s really afraid of course I mean\xe2\x80\x94or who does with him what she\r\nlikes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s awfully charming of you,\xe2\x80\x9d Bilham presently remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cnot to have\r\nasked me that before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99m not fit for my job!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe exclamation had escaped our friend, but it made little Bilham more\r\ndeliberate. \xe2\x80\x9cChad\xe2\x80\x99s a rare case!\xe2\x80\x9d he luminously observed. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s awfully\r\nchanged,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you see it too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe way he has improved? Oh yes\xe2\x80\x94I think every one must see it. But I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nnot sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said little Bilham, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like him about as well in\r\nhis other state.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen this _is_ really a new state altogether?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man after a moment returned, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure he was\r\nreally meant by nature to be quite so good. It\xe2\x80\x99s like the new edition\r\nof an old book that one has been fond of\xe2\x80\x94revised and amended, brought\r\nup to date, but not quite the thing one knew and loved. However that\r\nmay be at all events,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think, you know, that he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreally playing, as you call it, any game. I believe he really wants to\r\ngo back and take up a career. He\xe2\x80\x99s capable of one, you know, that will\r\nimprove and enlarge him still more. He won\xe2\x80\x99t then,\xe2\x80\x9d little Bilham\r\ncontinued to remark, \xe2\x80\x9cbe my pleasant well-rubbed old-fashioned volume\r\nat all. But of course I\xe2\x80\x99m beastly immoral. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it would be a\r\nfunny world altogether\xe2\x80\x94a world with things the way I like them. I\r\nought, I dare say, to go home and go into business myself. Only I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nsimply rather die\xe2\x80\x94simply. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve not the least difficulty in making\r\nup my mind not to, and in knowing exactly why, and in defending my\r\nground against all comers. All the same,\xe2\x80\x9d he wound up, \xe2\x80\x9cI assure you I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t say a word against it\xe2\x80\x94for himself, I mean\xe2\x80\x94to Chad. I seem to see\r\nit as much the best thing for him. You see he\xe2\x80\x99s not happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Do_ I?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Strether stared. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been supposing I see just the\r\nopposite\xe2\x80\x94an extraordinary case of the equilibrium arrived at and\r\nassured.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot behind it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh there you are!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just what I want to get\r\nat. You speak of your familiar volume altered out of recognition. Well,\r\nwho\xe2\x80\x99s the editor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham looked before him a minute in silence. \xe2\x80\x9cHe ought to get\r\nmarried. _That_ would do it. And he wants to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWants to marry her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain little Bilham waited, and, with a sense that he had information,\r\nStrether scarce knew what was coming. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wants to be free. He isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nused, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man explained in his lucid way, \xe2\x80\x9cto being so\r\ngood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I may take it from you that he _is_ good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion matched his pause, but making it up with a quiet fulness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Do_ take it from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then why isn\xe2\x80\x99t he free? He swears to me he is, but meanwhile does\r\nnothing\xe2\x80\x94except of course that he\xe2\x80\x99s so kind to me\xe2\x80\x94to prove it; and\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t really act much otherwise if he weren\xe2\x80\x99t. My question to you\r\njust now was exactly on this queer impression of his diplomacy: as if\r\ninstead of really giving ground his line were to keep me on here and\r\nset me a bad example.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the half-hour meanwhile had ebbed Strether paid his score, and the\r\nwaiter was presently in the act of counting out change. Our friend\r\npushed back to him a fraction of it, with which, after an emphatic\r\nrecognition, the personage in question retreated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou give too much,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nlittle Bilham permitted himself benevolently to observe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I always give too much!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether helplessly sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on as if to get quickly away from the contemplation of\r\nthat doom, \xe2\x80\x9canswer my question. Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t he free?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham had got up as if the transaction with the waiter had been\r\na signal, and had already edged out between the table and the divan.\r\nThe effect of this was that a minute later they had quitted the place,\r\nthe gratified waiter alert again at the open door. Strether had found\r\nhimself deferring to his companion\xe2\x80\x99s abruptness as to a hint that he\r\nshould be answered as soon as they were more isolated. This happened\r\nwhen after a few steps in the outer air they had turned the next\r\ncorner. There our friend had kept it up. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy isn\xe2\x80\x99t he free if he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham looked him full in the face. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause it\xe2\x80\x99s a virtuous\r\nattachment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis had settled the question so effectually for the time\xe2\x80\x94that is for\r\nthe next few days\xe2\x80\x94that it had given Strether almost a new lease of\r\nlife. It must be added however that, thanks to his constant habit of\r\nshaking the bottle in which life handed him the wine of experience, he\r\npresently found the taste of the lees rising as usual into his draught.\r\nHis imagination had in other words already dealt with his young\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s assertion; of which it had made something that sufficiently\r\ncame out on the very next occasion of his seeing Maria Gostrey. This\r\noccasion moreover had been determined promptly by a new circumstance\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ncircumstance he was the last man to leave her for a day in ignorance\r\nof. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I said to him last night,\xe2\x80\x9d he immediately began, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nwithout some definite word from him now that will enable me to speak to\r\nthem over there of our sailing\xe2\x80\x94or at least of mine, giving them some\r\nsort of date\xe2\x80\x94my responsibility becomes uncomfortable and my situation\r\nawkward; when I said that to him what do you think was his reply?\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthen as she this time gave it up: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy that he has two particular\r\nfriends, two ladies, mother and daughter, about to arrive in\r\nParis\xe2\x80\x94coming back from an absence; and that he wants me so furiously to\r\nmeet them, know them and like them, that I shall oblige him by kindly\r\nnot bringing our business to a crisis till he has had a chance to see\r\nthem again himself. Is that,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether enquired, \xe2\x80\x9cthe way he\xe2\x80\x99s going to\r\ntry to get off? These are the people,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he must have\r\ngone down to see before I arrived. They\xe2\x80\x99re the best friends he has in\r\nthe world, and they take more interest than any one else in what\r\nconcerns him. As I\xe2\x80\x99m his next best he sees a thousand reasons why we\r\nshould comfortably meet. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t broached the question sooner because\r\ntheir return was uncertain\xe2\x80\x94seemed in fact for the present impossible.\r\nBut he more than intimates that\xe2\x80\x94if you can believe it\xe2\x80\x94their desire to\r\nmake my acquaintance has had to do with their surmounting\r\ndifficulties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re dying to see you?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Gostrey asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDying. Of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re the virtuous attachment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe had already told her about that\xe2\x80\x94had seen her the day after his talk\r\nwith little Bilham; and they had then threshed out together the bearing\r\nof the revelation. She had helped him to put into it the logic in which\r\nlittle Bilham had left it slightly deficient Strether hadn\xe2\x80\x99t pressed\r\nhim as to the object of the preference so unexpectedly described;\r\nfeeling in the presence of it, with one of his irrepressible scruples,\r\na delicacy from which he had in the quest of the quite other article\r\nworked himself sufficiently free. He had held off, as on a small\r\nprinciple of pride, from permitting his young friend to mention a name;\r\nwishing to make with this the great point that Chad\xe2\x80\x99s virtuous\r\nattachments were none of his business. He had wanted from the first not\r\nto think too much of his dignity, but that was no reason for not\r\nallowing it any little benefit that might turn up. He had often enough\r\nwondered to what degree his interference might pass for interested; so\r\nthat there was no want of luxury in letting it be seen whenever he\r\ncould that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t interfere. That had of course at the same time not\r\ndeprived him of the further luxury of much private astonishment; which\r\nhowever he had reduced to some order before communicating his\r\nknowledge. When he had done this at last it was with the remark that,\r\nsurprised as Miss Gostrey might, like himself, at first be, she would\r\nprobably agree with him on reflexion that such an account of the matter\r\ndid after all fit the confirmed appearances. Nothing certainly, on all\r\nthe indications, could have been a greater change for him than a\r\nvirtuous attachment, and since they had been in search of the \xe2\x80\x9cword\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\nthe French called it, of that change, little Bilham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nannouncement\xe2\x80\x94though so long and so oddly delayed\xe2\x80\x94would serve as well as\r\nanother. She had assured Strether in fact after a pause that the more\r\nshe thought of it the more it did serve; and yet her assurance hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nso weighed with him as that before they parted he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t ventured to\r\nchallenge her sincerity. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t she believe the attachment _was_\r\nvirtuous?\xe2\x80\x94he had made sure of her again with the aid of that question.\r\nThe tidings he brought her on this second occasion were moreover such\r\nas would help him to make surer still.\r\n\r\nShe showed at first none the less as only amused. \xe2\x80\x9cYou say there are\r\ntwo? An attachment to them both then would, I suppose, almost\r\nnecessarily be innocent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur friend took the point, but he had his clue. \xe2\x80\x9cMayn\xe2\x80\x99t he be still in\r\nthe stage of not quite knowing which of them, mother or daughter, he\r\nlikes best?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave it more thought. \xe2\x80\x9cOh it must be the daughter\xe2\x80\x94at his age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly. Yet what do we know,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether asked, \xe2\x80\x9cabout hers? She may\r\nbe old enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld enough for what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy to marry Chad. That may be, you know, what they want. And if Chad\r\nwants it too, and little Bilham wants it, and even _we_, at a pinch,\r\ncould do with it\xe2\x80\x94that is if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent repatriation\xe2\x80\x94why it may\r\nbe plain sailing yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was always the case for him in these counsels that each of his\r\nremarks, as it came, seemed to drop into a deeper well. He had at all\r\nevents to wait a moment to hear the slight splash of this one. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee why if Mr. Newsome wants to marry the young lady he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t already\r\ndone it or hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been prepared with some statement to you about it.\r\nAnd if he both wants to marry her and is on good terms with them why\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t he \xe2\x80\x98free\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether, responsively, wondered indeed. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps the girl herself\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t like him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why does he speak of them to you as he does?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s mind echoed the question, but also again met it. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s with the mother he\xe2\x80\x99s on good terms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs against the daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if she\xe2\x80\x99s trying to persuade the daughter to consent to him, what\r\ncould make him like the mother more? Only,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether threw out, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the daughter consent to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Gostrey, \xe2\x80\x9cmayn\xe2\x80\x99t it be that every one else isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite\r\nso struck with him as you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t regard him you mean as such an \xe2\x80\x98eligible\xe2\x80\x99 young man? _Is_ that\r\nwhat I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to?\xe2\x80\x9d he audibly and rather gravely sought to know.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9chis marriage is what his mother most\r\ndesires\xe2\x80\x94that is if it will help. And oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t _any_ marriage to help?\r\nThey must want him\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he had already worked it out\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto be better off.\r\nAlmost any girl he may marry will have a direct interest in his taking\r\nup his chances. It won\xe2\x80\x99t suit _her_ at least that he shall miss them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey cast about. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94you reason well! But of course on the\r\nother hand there\xe2\x80\x99s always dear old Woollett itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he mused\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s always dear old Woollett itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cThe young lady mayn\xe2\x80\x99t find herself able to\r\nswallow _that_ quantity. She may think it\xe2\x80\x99s paying too much; she may\r\nweigh one thing against another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether, ever restless in such debates, took a vague turn \xe2\x80\x9cIt will all\r\ndepend on who she is. That of course\xe2\x80\x94the proved ability to deal with\r\ndear old Woollett, since I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she does deal with it\xe2\x80\x94is what makes\r\nso strongly for Mamie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped short, at her tone, before her; then, though seeing that it\r\nrepresented not vagueness, but a momentary embarrassed fulness, let his\r\nexclamation come. \xe2\x80\x9cYou surely haven\xe2\x80\x99t forgotten about Mamie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t forgotten about Mamie,\xe2\x80\x9d she smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt\r\nwhatever that there\xe2\x80\x99s ever so much to be said for her. Mamie\xe2\x80\x99s _my_\r\ngirl!\xe2\x80\x9d she roundly declared.\r\n\r\nStrether resumed for a minute his walk. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s really perfectly lovely,\r\nyou know. Far prettier than any girl I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over here yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s precisely on what I perhaps most build.\xe2\x80\x9d And she mused a moment\r\nin her friend\xe2\x80\x99s way. \xe2\x80\x9cI should positively like to take her in hand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe humoured the fancy, though indeed finally to deprecate it. \xe2\x80\x9cOh but\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t, in your zeal, go over to her! I need you most and can\xe2\x80\x99t, you\r\nknow, be left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she kept it up. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish they\xe2\x80\x99d send her out to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they knew you,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, \xe2\x80\x9cthey would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but don\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x94after all that, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve understood you you\xe2\x80\x99ve told\r\nthem about me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had paused before her again, but he continued his course \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\n_will_\xe2\x80\x94before, as you say, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he came out with the point\r\nhe had wished after all most to make. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to give away now his\r\ngame. This is what he has been doing\xe2\x80\x94keeping me along for. He has been\r\nwaiting for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey drew in her lips. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see a good deal in it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doubt if I see as much as you. Do you pretend,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t see\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she pressed him as he paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy that there must be a lot between them\xe2\x80\x94and that it has been going\r\non from the first; even from before I came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took a minute to answer. \xe2\x80\x9cWho are they then\xe2\x80\x94if it\xe2\x80\x99s so grave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt mayn\xe2\x80\x99t be grave\xe2\x80\x94it may be gay. But at any rate it\xe2\x80\x99s marked. Only I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether had to confess, \xe2\x80\x9canything about them. Their name\r\nfor instance was a thing that, after little Bilham\xe2\x80\x99s information, I\r\nfound it a kind of refreshment not to feel obliged to follow up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, \xe2\x80\x9cif you think you\xe2\x80\x99ve got off\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer laugh produced in him a momentary gloom. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\noff. I only think I\xe2\x80\x99m breathing for about five minutes. I dare say I\r\n_shall_ have, at the best, still to get on.\xe2\x80\x9d A look, over it all,\r\npassed between them, and the next minute he had come back to good\r\nhumour. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t meanwhile take the smallest interest in their name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor in their nationality?\xe2\x80\x94American, French, English, Polish?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care the least little \xe2\x80\x98hang,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled, \xe2\x80\x9cfor their\r\nnationality. It would be nice if they\xe2\x80\x99re Polish!\xe2\x80\x9d he almost immediately\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery nice indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d The transition kept up her spirits. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you see you\r\ndo care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did this contention a modified justice. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I should if they\r\n_were_ Polish. Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthere might be joy in _that_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us then hope for it.\xe2\x80\x9d But she came after this nearer to the\r\nquestion. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the girl\xe2\x80\x99s of the right age of course the mother can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe. I mean for the virtuous attachment. If the girl\xe2\x80\x99s twenty\xe2\x80\x94and she\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be less\xe2\x80\x94the mother must be at least forty. So it puts the mother\r\nout. _She\xe2\x80\x99s_ too old for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether, arrested again, considered and demurred. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think so? Do\r\nyou think any one would be too old for him? _I\xe2\x80\x99m_ eighty, and I\xe2\x80\x99m too\r\nyoung. But perhaps the girl,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9c_isn\xe2\x80\x99t_ twenty. Perhaps\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s only ten\xe2\x80\x94but such a little dear that Chad finds himself counting\r\nher in as an attraction of the acquaintance. Perhaps she\xe2\x80\x99s only five.\r\nPerhaps the mother\xe2\x80\x99s but five-and-twenty\xe2\x80\x94a charming young widow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey entertained the suggestion. \xe2\x80\x9cShe _is_ a widow then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t the least idea!\xe2\x80\x9d They once more, in spite of this vagueness,\r\nexchanged a look\xe2\x80\x94a look that was perhaps the longest yet. It seemed in\r\nfact, the next thing, to require to explain itself; which it did as it\r\ncould. \xe2\x80\x9cI only feel what I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you\xe2\x80\x94that he has some reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey\xe2\x80\x99s imagination had taken its own flight. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_not_ a widow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether seemed to accept the possibility with reserve. Still he\r\naccepted it. \xe2\x80\x9cThen that\xe2\x80\x99s why the attachment\xe2\x80\x94if it\xe2\x80\x99s to her\xe2\x80\x94is\r\nvirtuous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she looked as if she scarce followed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it virtuous if\xe2\x80\x94since\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s free\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to impose on it any condition?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed at her question. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I perhaps don\xe2\x80\x99t mean as virtuous as\r\n_that!_ Your idea is that it can be virtuous\xe2\x80\x94in any sense worthy of the\r\nname\xe2\x80\x94only if she\xe2\x80\x99s _not_ free? But what does it become then,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor _her?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh that\xe2\x80\x99s another matter.\xe2\x80\x9d He said nothing for a moment, and she soon\r\nwent on. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say you\xe2\x80\x99re right, at any rate, about Mr. Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlittle plan. He _has_ been trying you\xe2\x80\x94has been reporting on you to\r\nthese friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether meanwhile had had time to think more. \xe2\x80\x9cThen where\xe2\x80\x99s his\r\nstraightness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, as we say, it\xe2\x80\x99s struggling up, breaking out, asserting itself as\r\nit can. We can be on the side, you see, of his straightness. We can\r\nhelp him. But he has made out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Gostrey, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\xe2\x80\x99ll do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo for what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, for _them_\xe2\x80\x94for _ces dames_. He has watched you, studied you,\r\nliked you\xe2\x80\x94and recognised that _they_ must. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great compliment to\r\nyou, my dear man; for I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99re particular. You came out for a\r\nsuccess. Well,\xe2\x80\x9d she gaily declared, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re having it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took it from her with momentary patience and then turned abruptly\r\naway. It was always convenient to him that there were so many fine\r\nthings in her room to look at. But the examination of two or three of\r\nthem appeared soon to have determined a speech that had little to do\r\nwith them. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the character of the attachment. In its innocence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she defended herself. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to know anything about it.\r\nEverything\xe2\x80\x99s possible. We must see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee?\xe2\x80\x9d he echoed with a groan. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t we seen enough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ haven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do you suppose then little Bilham has lied?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must find out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt made him almost turn pale. \xe2\x80\x9cFind out any _more?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had dropped on a sofa for dismay; but she seemed, as she stood over\r\nhim, to have the last word. \xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t what you came out for to find out\r\n_all?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook Fifth\r\n\r\n\r\n I\r\n\r\nThe Sunday of the next week was a wonderful day, and Chad Newsome had\r\nlet his friend know in advance that he had provided for it. There had\r\nalready been a question of his taking him to see the great Gloriani,\r\nwho was at home on Sunday afternoons and at whose house, for the most\r\npart, fewer bores were to be met than elsewhere; but the project,\r\nthrough some accident, had not had instant effect, and now revived in\r\nhappier conditions. Chad had made the point that the celebrated\r\nsculptor had a queer old garden, for which the weather\xe2\x80\x94spring at last\r\nfrank and fair\xe2\x80\x94was propitious; and two or three of his other allusions\r\nhad confirmed for Strether the expectation of something special. He had\r\nby this time, for all introductions and adventures, let himself\r\nrecklessly go, cherishing the sense that whatever the young man showed\r\nhim he was showing at least himself. He could have wished indeed, so\r\nfar as this went, that Chad were less of a mere cicerone; for he was\r\nnot without the impression\xe2\x80\x94now that the vision of his game, his plan,\r\nhis deep diplomacy, did recurrently assert itself\xe2\x80\x94of his taking refuge\r\nfrom the realities of their intercourse in profusely dispensing, as our\r\nfriend mentally phrased it, _panem et circenses_. Our friend continued\r\nto feel rather smothered in flowers, though he made in his other\r\nmoments the almost angry inference that this was only because of his\r\nodious ascetic suspicion of any form of beauty. He periodically assured\r\nhimself\xe2\x80\x94for his reactions were sharp\xe2\x80\x94that he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t reach the truth\r\nof anything till he had at least got rid of that.\r\n\r\nHe had known beforehand that Madame de Vionnet and her daughter would\r\nprobably be on view, an intimation to that effect having constituted\r\nthe only reference again made by Chad to his good friends from the\r\nsouth. The effect of Strether\xe2\x80\x99s talk about them with Miss Gostrey had\r\nbeen quite to consecrate his reluctance to pry; something in the very\r\nair of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s silence\xe2\x80\x94judged in the light of that talk\xe2\x80\x94offered it to\r\nhim as a reserve he could markedly match. It shrouded them about with\r\nhe scarce knew what, a consideration, a distinction; he was in presence\r\nat any rate\xe2\x80\x94so far as it placed him there\xe2\x80\x94of ladies; and the one thing\r\nthat was definite for him was that they themselves should be, to the\r\nextent of his responsibility, in presence of a gentleman. Was it\r\nbecause they were very beautiful, very clever, or even very good\xe2\x80\x94was it\r\nfor one of these reasons that Chad was, so to speak, nursing his\r\neffect? Did he wish to spring them, in the Woollett phrase, with a\r\nfuller force\xe2\x80\x94to confound his critic, slight though as yet the\r\ncriticism, with some form of merit exquisitely incalculable? The most\r\nthe critic had at all events asked was whether the persons in question\r\nwere French; and that enquiry had been but a proper comment on the\r\nsound of their name. \xe2\x80\x9cYes. That is no!\xe2\x80\x9d had been Chad\xe2\x80\x99s reply; but he\r\nhad immediately added that their English was the most charming in the\r\nworld, so that if Strether were wanting an excuse for not getting on\r\nwith them he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t in the least find one. Never in fact had\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x94in the mood into which the place had quickly launched\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94felt, for himself, less the need of an excuse. Those he might have\r\nfound would have been, at the worst, all for the others, the people\r\nbefore him, in whose liberty to be as they were he was aware that he\r\npositively rejoiced. His fellow guests were multiplying, and these\r\nthings, their liberty, their intensity, their variety, their conditions\r\nat large, were in fusion in the admirable medium of the scene.\r\n\r\nThe place itself was a great impression\xe2\x80\x94a small pavilion, clear-faced\r\nand sequestered, an effect of polished parquet, of fine white panel and\r\nspare sallow gilt, of decoration delicate and rare, in the heart of the\r\nFaubourg Saint-Germain and on the edge of a cluster of gardens attached\r\nto old noble houses. Far back from streets and unsuspected by crowds,\r\nreached by a long passage and a quiet court, it was as striking to the\r\nunprepared mind, he immediately saw, as a treasure dug up; giving him\r\ntoo, more than anything yet, the note of the range of the immeasurable\r\ntown and sweeping away, as by a last brave brush, his usual landmarks\r\nand terms. It was in the garden, a spacious cherished remnant, out of\r\nwhich a dozen persons had already passed, that Chad\xe2\x80\x99s host presently\r\nmet them while the tall bird-haunted trees, all of a twitter with the\r\nspring and the weather, and the high party-walls, on the other side of\r\nwhich grave _h\xc3\xb4tels_ stood off for privacy, spoke of survival,\r\ntransmission, association, a strong indifferent persistent order. The\r\nday was so soft that the little party had practically adjourned to the\r\nopen air but the open air was in such conditions all a chamber of\r\nstate. Strether had presently the sense of a great convent, a convent\r\nof missions, famous for he scarce knew what, a nursery of young\r\npriests, of scattered shade, of straight alleys and chapel-bells, that\r\nspread its mass in one quarter; he had the sense of names in the air,\r\nof ghosts at the windows, of signs and tokens, a whole range of\r\nexpression, all about him, too thick for prompt discrimination.\r\n\r\nThis assault of images became for a moment, in the address of the\r\ndistinguished sculptor, almost formidable: Gloriani showed him, in such\r\nperfect confidence, on Chad\xe2\x80\x99s introduction of him, a fine worn handsome\r\nface, a face that was like an open letter in a foreign tongue. With his\r\ngenius in his eyes, his manners on his lips, his long career behind him\r\nand his honours and rewards all round, the great artist, in the course\r\nof a single sustained look and a few words of delight at receiving him,\r\naffected our friend as a dazzling prodigy of type. Strether had seen in\r\nmuseums\xe2\x80\x94in the Luxembourg as well as, more reverently, later on, in the\r\nNew York of the billionaires\xe2\x80\x94the work of his hand; knowing too that\r\nafter an earlier time in his native Rome he had migrated, in\r\nmid-career, to Paris, where, with a personal lustre almost violent, he\r\nshone in a constellation: all of which was more than enough to crown\r\nhim, for his guest, with the light, with the romance, of glory.\r\nStrether, in contact with that element as he had never yet so\r\nintimately been, had the consciousness of opening to it, for the happy\r\ninstant, all the windows of his mind, of letting this rather grey\r\ninterior drink in for once the sun of a clime not marked in his old\r\ngeography. He was to remember again repeatedly the medal-like Italian\r\nface, in which every line was an artist\xe2\x80\x99s own, in which time told only\r\nas tone and consecration; and he was to recall in especial, as the\r\npenetrating radiance, as the communication of the illustrious spirit\r\nitself, the manner in which, while they stood briefly, in welcome and\r\nresponse, face to face, he was held by the sculptor\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsoon to forget them, was to think of them, all unconscious,\r\nunintending, preoccupied though they were, as the source of the deepest\r\nintellectual sounding to which he had ever been exposed. He was in fact\r\nquite to cherish his vision of it, to play with it in idle hours; only\r\nspeaking of it to no one and quite aware he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have spoken\r\nwithout appearing to talk nonsense. Was what it had told him or what it\r\nhad asked him the greater of the mysteries? Was it the most special\r\nflare, unequalled, supreme, of the \xc3\xa6sthetic torch, lighting that\r\nwondrous world for ever, or was it above all the long straight shaft\r\nsunk by a personal acuteness that life had seasoned to steel? Nothing\r\non earth could have been stranger and no one doubtless more surprised\r\nthan the artist himself, but it was for all the world to Strether just\r\nthen as if in the matter of his accepted duty he had positively been on\r\ntrial. The deep human expertness in Gloriani\xe2\x80\x99s charming smile\xe2\x80\x94oh the\r\nterrible life behind it!\xe2\x80\x94was flashed upon him as a test of his stuff.\r\n\r\nChad meanwhile, after having easily named his companion, had still more\r\neasily turned away and was already greeting other persons present. He\r\nwas as easy, clever Chad, with the great artist as with his obscure\r\ncompatriot, and as easy with every one else as with either: this fell\r\ninto its place for Strether and made almost a new light, giving him, as\r\na concatenation, something more he could enjoy. He liked Gloriani, but\r\nshould never see him again; of that he was sufficiently sure. Chad\r\naccordingly, who was wonderful with both of them, was a kind of link\r\nfor hopeless fancy, an implication of possibilities\xe2\x80\x94oh if everything\r\nhad been different! Strether noted at all events that he was thus on\r\nterms with illustrious spirits, and also that\xe2\x80\x94yes, distinctly\xe2\x80\x94he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nin the least swaggered about it. Our friend hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come there only for\r\nthis figure of Abel Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s son, but that presence threatened to\r\naffect the observant mind as positively central. Gloriani indeed,\r\nremembering something and excusing himself, pursued Chad to speak to\r\nhim, and Strether was left musing on many things. One of them was the\r\nquestion of whether, since he had been tested, he had passed. Did the\r\nartist drop him from having made out that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do? He really\r\nfelt just to-day that he might do better than usual. Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t he done\r\nwell enough, so far as that went, in being exactly so dazzled? and in\r\nnot having too, as he almost believed, wholly hidden from his host that\r\nhe felt the latter\xe2\x80\x99s plummet? Suddenly, across the garden, he saw\r\nlittle Bilham approach, and it was a part of the fit that was on him\r\nthat as their eyes met he guessed also _his_ knowledge. If he had said\r\nto him on the instant what was uppermost he would have said: \xe2\x80\x9c_Have_ I\r\npassed?\xe2\x80\x94for of course I know one has to pass here.\xe2\x80\x9d Little Bilham would\r\nhave reassured him, have told him that he exaggerated, and have adduced\r\nhappily enough the argument of little Bilham\xe2\x80\x99s own very presence;\r\nwhich, in truth, he could see, was as easy a one as Gloriani\xe2\x80\x99s own or\r\nas Chad\xe2\x80\x99s. He himself would perhaps then after a while cease to be\r\nfrightened, would get the point of view for some of the faces\xe2\x80\x94types\r\ntremendously alien, alien to Woollett\xe2\x80\x94that he had already begun to take\r\nin. Who were they all, the dispersed groups and couples, the ladies\r\neven more unlike those of Woollett than the gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x94this was the\r\nenquiry that, when his young friend had greeted him, he did find\r\nhimself making.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh they\xe2\x80\x99re every one\xe2\x80\x94all sorts and sizes; of course I mean within\r\nlimits, though limits down perhaps rather more than limits up. There\r\nare always artists\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful and inimitable to the _cher\r\nconfr\xc3\xa8re_; and then _gros bonnets_ of many kinds\xe2\x80\x94ambassadors, cabinet\r\nministers, bankers, generals, what do I know? even Jews. Above all\r\nalways some awfully nice women\xe2\x80\x94and not too many; sometimes an actress,\r\nan artist, a great performer\xe2\x80\x94but only when they\xe2\x80\x99re not monsters; and in\r\nparticular the right _femmes du monde_. You can fancy his history on\r\nthat side\xe2\x80\x94I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s fabulous: they _never_ give him up. Yet he\r\nkeeps them down: no one knows how he manages; it\xe2\x80\x99s too beautiful and\r\nbland. Never too many\xe2\x80\x94and a mighty good thing too; just a perfect\r\nchoice. But there are not in any way many bores; it has always been so;\r\nhe has some secret. It\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary. And you don\xe2\x80\x99t find it out. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe same to every one. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t ask questions.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether laughed.\r\n\r\nBilham met it with all his candour. \xe2\x80\x9cHow then should _I_ be here?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh for what you tell me. You\xe2\x80\x99re part of the perfect choice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, the young man took in the scene. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems rather good to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether followed the direction of his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cAre they all, this time,\r\n_femmes du monde?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham showed his competence. \xe2\x80\x9cPretty well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a category our friend had a feeling for; a light, romantic and\r\nmysterious, on the feminine element, in which he enjoyed for a little\r\nwatching it. \xe2\x80\x9cAre there any Poles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion considered. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I make out a \xe2\x80\x98Portuguee.\xe2\x80\x99 But I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nseen Turks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether wondered, desiring justice. \xe2\x80\x9cThey seem\xe2\x80\x94all the women\xe2\x80\x94very\r\nharmonious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh in closer quarters they come out!\xe2\x80\x9d And then, while Strether was\r\naware of fearing closer quarters, though giving himself again to the\r\nharmonies, \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d little Bilham went on, \xe2\x80\x9cit _is_ at the worst rather\r\ngood, you know. If you like it, you feel it, this way, that shows\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re not in the least out. But you always know things,\xe2\x80\x9d he handsomely\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cimmediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether liked it and felt it only too much; so \xe2\x80\x9cI say, don\xe2\x80\x99t lay traps\r\nfor me!\xe2\x80\x9d he rather helplessly murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d his companion returned, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s wonderfully kind to _us_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo us Americans you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about _that_. That\xe2\x80\x99s half the battle\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x94that you can never hear politics. We don\xe2\x80\x99t talk them. I mean to\r\npoor young wretches of all sorts. And yet it\xe2\x80\x99s always as charming as\r\nthis; it\xe2\x80\x99s as if, by something in the air, our squalor didn\xe2\x80\x99t show. It\r\nputs us all back\xe2\x80\x94into the last century.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether said, amused, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it puts me rather forward:\r\noh ever so far!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInto the next? But isn\xe2\x80\x99t that only,\xe2\x80\x9d little Bilham asked, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re really of the century before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe century before the last? Thank you!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I ask\r\nyou about some of the ladies it can\xe2\x80\x99t be then that I may hope, as such\r\na specimen of the rococo, to please them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary they adore\xe2\x80\x94we all adore here\xe2\x80\x94the rococo, and where is\r\nthere a better setting for it than the whole thing, the pavilion and\r\nthe garden, together? There are lots of people with collections,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nlittle Bilham smiled as he glanced round. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be secured!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt made Strether for a moment give himself again to contemplation.\r\nThere were faces he scarce knew what to make of. Were they charming or\r\nwere they only strange? He mightn\xe2\x80\x99t talk politics, yet he suspected a\r\nPole or two. The upshot was the question at the back of his head from\r\nthe moment his friend had joined him. \xe2\x80\x9cHave Madame de Vionnet and her\r\ndaughter arrived?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen them yet, but Miss Gostrey has come. She\xe2\x80\x99s in the\r\npavilion looking at objects. One can see _she\xe2\x80\x99s_ a collector,\xe2\x80\x9d little\r\nBilham added without offence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, she\xe2\x80\x99s a collector, and I knew she was to come. Is Madame de\r\nVionnet a collector?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather, I believe; almost celebrated.\xe2\x80\x9d The young man met, on it, a\r\nlittle, his friend\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI happen to know\xe2\x80\x94from Chad, whom I saw last\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x94that they\xe2\x80\x99ve come back; but only yesterday. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure\xe2\x80\x94up to\r\nthe last. This, accordingly,\xe2\x80\x9d little Bilham went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwill be\xe2\x80\x94if they\r\n_are_ here\xe2\x80\x94their first appearance after their return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether, very quickly, turned these things over. \xe2\x80\x9cChad told you last\r\nnight? To me, on our way here, he said nothing about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut did you ask him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether did him the justice. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said little Bilham, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re not a person to whom it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to\r\ntell things you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know. Though it _is_ easy, I admit\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquite beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d he benevolently added, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you do want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether looked at him with an indulgence that matched his\r\nintelligence. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that the deep reasoning on which\xe2\x80\x94about these\r\nladies\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve been yourself so silent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham considered the depth of his reasoning. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nsilent. I spoke of them to you the other day, the day we sat together\r\nafter Chad\xe2\x80\x99s tea-party.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether came round to it. \xe2\x80\x9cThey then are the virtuous attachment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can only tell you that it\xe2\x80\x99s what they pass for. But isn\xe2\x80\x99t that\r\nenough? What more than a vain appearance does the wisest of us know? I\r\ncommend you,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man declared with a pleasant emphasis, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nvain appearance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether looked more widely round, and what he saw, from face to face,\r\ndeepened the effect of his young friend\xe2\x80\x99s words. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it so good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMagnificent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether had a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cThe husband\xe2\x80\x99s dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear no. Alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether. After which, as his companion laughed: \xe2\x80\x9cHow then\r\ncan it be so good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll see for yourself. One does see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChad\xe2\x80\x99s in love with the daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cThen where\xe2\x80\x99s the difficulty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you and I\xe2\x80\x94with our grander bolder ideas?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh mine\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether said rather strangely. But then as if to\r\nattenuate: \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean they won\xe2\x80\x99t hear of Woollett?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that just what you must see about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt had brought them, as she caught the last words, into relation with\r\nMiss Barrace, whom Strether had already observed\xe2\x80\x94as he had never before\r\nseen a lady at a party\xe2\x80\x94moving about alone. Coming within sound of them\r\nshe had already spoken, and she took again, through her long-handled\r\nglass, all her amused and amusing possession. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much, poor Mr.\r\nStrether, you seem to have to see about! But you can\xe2\x80\x99t say,\xe2\x80\x9d she gaily\r\ndeclared, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I don\xe2\x80\x99t do what I can to help you. Mr. Waymarsh is\r\nplaced. I\xe2\x80\x99ve left him in the house with Miss Gostrey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe way,\xe2\x80\x9d little Bilham exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Strether gets the ladies to\r\nwork for him! He\xe2\x80\x99s just preparing to draw in another; to pounce\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou see him?\xe2\x80\x94on Madame de Vionnet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame de Vionnet? Oh, oh, oh!\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Barrace cried in a wonderful\r\ncrescendo. There was more in it, our friend made out, than met the ear.\r\nWas it after all a joke that he should be serious about anything? He\r\nenvied Miss Barrace at any rate her power of not being. She seemed,\r\nwith little cries and protests and quick recognitions, movements like\r\nthe darts of some fine high-feathered free-pecking bird, to stand\r\nbefore life as before some full shop-window. You could fairly hear, as\r\nshe selected and pointed, the tap of her tortoise-shell against the\r\nglass. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s certain that we do need seeing about; only I\xe2\x80\x99m glad it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot I who have to do it. One does, no doubt, begin that way; then\r\nsuddenly one finds that one has given it up. It\xe2\x80\x99s too much, it\xe2\x80\x99s too\r\ndifficult. You\xe2\x80\x99re wonderful, you people,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued to Strether,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor not feeling those things\xe2\x80\x94by which I mean impossibilities. You\r\nnever feel them. You face them with a fortitude that makes it a lesson\r\nto watch you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94little Bilham put it with discouragement\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhat do we achieve\r\nafter all? We see about you and report\xe2\x80\x94when we even go so far as\r\nreporting. But nothing\xe2\x80\x99s done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you, Mr. Bilham,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied as with an impatient rap on the\r\nglass, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re not worth sixpence! You come over to convert the\r\nsavages\xe2\x80\x94for I know you verily did, I remember you\xe2\x80\x94and the savages\r\nsimply convert _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot even!\xe2\x80\x9d the young man woefully confessed: \xe2\x80\x9cthey haven\xe2\x80\x99t gone\r\nthrough that form. They\xe2\x80\x99ve simply\xe2\x80\x94the cannibals!\xe2\x80\x94eaten me; converted me\r\nif you like, but converted me into food. I\xe2\x80\x99m but the bleached bones of\r\na Christian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then there we are! Only\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and Miss Barrace appealed again to\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t let it discourage you. You\xe2\x80\x99ll break down soon enough,\r\nbut you\xe2\x80\x99ll meanwhile have had your moments. _Il faut en avoir_. I\r\nalways like to see you while you last. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you who _will_\r\nlast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaymarsh?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he had already taken her up.\r\n\r\nShe laughed out as at the alarm of it. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll resist even Miss Gostrey:\r\nso grand is it not to understand. He\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether conceded. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me of this\r\naffair\xe2\x80\x94only said he had an engagement; but with such a gloom, you must\r\nlet me insist, as if it had been an engagement to be hanged. Then\r\nsilently and secretly he turns up here with you. Do you call _that_\r\n\xe2\x80\x98lasting\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s lasting!\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Barrace said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he only, at the best,\r\nbears with me. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand\xe2\x80\x94not one little scrap. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndelightful. He\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMichelangelesque!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94little Bilham completed her meaning. \xe2\x80\x9cHe _is_ a\r\nsuccess. Moses, on the ceiling, brought down to the floor;\r\noverwhelming, colossal, but somehow portable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, if you mean by portable,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, \xe2\x80\x9clooking so well in\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s carriage. He\xe2\x80\x99s too funny beside me in his corner; he looks like\r\nsomebody, somebody foreign and famous, _en exil_; so that people\r\nwonder\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s very amusing\xe2\x80\x94whom I\xe2\x80\x99m taking about. I show him Paris, show\r\nhim everything, and he never turns a hair. He\xe2\x80\x99s like the Indian chief\r\none reads about, who, when he comes up to Washington to see the Great\r\nFather, stands wrapt in his blanket and gives no sign. _I_ might be the\r\nGreat Father\xe2\x80\x94from the way he takes everything.\xe2\x80\x9d She was delighted at\r\nthis hit of her identity with that personage\xe2\x80\x94it fitted so her\r\ncharacter; she declared it was the title she meant henceforth to adopt.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the way he sits, too, in the corner of my room, only looking at my\r\nvisitors very hard and as if he wanted to start something! They wonder\r\nwhat he does want to start. But he\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Barrace once more\r\ninsisted. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has never started anything yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt presented him none the less, in truth, to her actual friends, who\r\nlooked at each other in intelligence, with frank amusement on Bilham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npart and a shade of sadness on Strether\xe2\x80\x99s. Strether\xe2\x80\x99s sadness\r\nsprang\xe2\x80\x94for the image had its grandeur\xe2\x80\x94from his thinking how little he\r\nhimself was wrapt in his blanket, how little, in marble halls, all too\r\noblivious of the Great Father, he resembled a really majestic\r\naboriginal. But he had also another reflexion. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve all of you here\r\nso much visual sense that you\xe2\x80\x99ve somehow all \xe2\x80\x98run\xe2\x80\x99 to it. There are\r\nmoments when it strikes one that you haven\xe2\x80\x99t any other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny moral,\xe2\x80\x9d little Bilham explained, watching serenely, across the\r\ngarden, the several _femmes du monde_. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Miss Barrace has a moral\r\ndistinction,\xe2\x80\x9d he kindly continued; speaking as if for Strether\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbenefit not less than for her own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Have_ you?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether, scarce knowing what he was about, asked of her\r\nalmost eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh not a distinction\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she was mightily amused at his tone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nBilham\xe2\x80\x99s too good. But I think I may say a sufficiency. Yes, a\r\nsufficiency. Have you supposed strange things of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and she fixed him\r\nagain, through all her tortoise-shell, with the droll interest of it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _are_ all indeed wonderful. I should awfully disappoint you. I do\r\ntake my stand on my sufficiency. But I know, I confess,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cstrange people. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it happens; I don\xe2\x80\x99t do it on purpose;\r\nit seems to be my doom\xe2\x80\x94as if I were always one of their habits: it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwonderful! I dare say moreover,\xe2\x80\x9d she pursued with an interested\r\ngravity, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I do, that we all do here, run too much to mere eye. But\r\nhow can it be helped? We\xe2\x80\x99re all looking at each other\xe2\x80\x94and in the light\r\nof Paris one sees what things resemble. That\xe2\x80\x99s what the light of Paris\r\nseems always to show. It\xe2\x80\x99s the fault of the light of Paris\xe2\x80\x94dear old\r\nlight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear old Paris!\xe2\x80\x9d little Bilham echoed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything, every one shows,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Barrace went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut for what they really are?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I like your Boston \xe2\x80\x98reallys\xe2\x80\x99! But sometimes\xe2\x80\x94yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear old Paris then!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether resignedly sighed while for a moment\r\nthey looked at each other. Then he broke out: \xe2\x80\x9cDoes Madame de Vionnet\r\ndo that? I mean really show for what she is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer answer was prompt. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s charming. She\xe2\x80\x99s perfect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why did you a minute ago say \xe2\x80\x98Oh, oh, oh!\xe2\x80\x99 at her name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe easily remembered. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy just because\xe2\x80\x94! She\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh she too?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Strether had almost a groan.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Barrace had meanwhile perceived relief. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not put your\r\nquestion straight to the person who can answer it best?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said little Bilham; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t put any question; wait, rather\xe2\x80\x94it will\r\nbe much more fun\xe2\x80\x94to judge for yourself. He has come to take you to\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n II\r\n\r\nOn which Strether saw that Chad was again at hand, and he afterwards\r\nscarce knew, absurd as it may seem, what had then quickly occurred. The\r\nmoment concerned him, he felt, more deeply than he could have\r\nexplained, and he had a subsequent passage of speculation as to\r\nwhether, on walking off with Chad, he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t looked either pale or red.\r\nThe only thing he was clear about was that, luckily, nothing indiscreet\r\nhad in fact been said and that Chad himself was more than ever, in Miss\r\nBarrace\xe2\x80\x99s great sense, wonderful. It was one of the connexions\xe2\x80\x94though\r\nreally why it should be, after all, was none so apparent\xe2\x80\x94in which the\r\nwhole change in him came out as most striking. Strether recalled as\r\nthey approached the house that he had impressed him that first night as\r\nknowing how to enter a box. Well, he impressed him scarce less now as\r\nknowing how to make a presentation. It did something for Strether\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nquality\xe2\x80\x94marked it as estimated; so that our poor friend, conscious and\r\npassive, really seemed to feel himself quite handed over and delivered;\r\nabsolutely, as he would have said, made a present of, given away. As\r\nthey reached the house a young woman, about to come forth, appeared,\r\nunaccompanied, on the steps; at the exchange with whom of a word on\r\nChad\xe2\x80\x99s part Strether immediately perceived that, obligingly, kindly,\r\nshe was there to meet them. Chad had left her in the house, but she had\r\nafterwards come halfway and then the next moment had joined them in the\r\ngarden. Her air of youth, for Strether, was at first almost\r\ndisconcerting, while his second impression was, not less sharply, a\r\ndegree of relief at there not having just been, with the others, any\r\nfreedom used about her. It was upon him at a touch that she was no\r\nsubject for that, and meanwhile, on Chad\xe2\x80\x99s introducing him, she had\r\nspoken to him, very simply and gently, in an English clearly of the\r\neasiest to her, yet unlike any other he had ever heard. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as if\r\nshe tried; nothing, he could see after they had been a few minutes\r\ntogether, was as if she tried; but her speech, charming correct and\r\nodd, was like a precaution against her passing for a Pole. There were\r\nprecautions, he seemed indeed to see, only when there were really\r\ndangers.\r\n\r\nLater on he was to feel many more of them, but by that time he was to\r\nfeel other things besides. She was dressed in black, but in black that\r\nstruck him as light and transparent; she was exceedingly fair, and,\r\nthough she was as markedly slim, her face had a roundness, with eyes\r\nfar apart and a little strange. Her smile was natural and dim; her hat\r\nnot extravagant; he had only perhaps a sense of the clink, beneath her\r\nfine black sleeves, of more gold bracelets and bangles than he had ever\r\nseen a lady wear. Chad was excellently free and light about their\r\nencounter; it was one of the occasions on which Strether most wished he\r\nhimself might have arrived at such ease and such humour: \xe2\x80\x9cHere you are\r\nthen, face to face at last; you\xe2\x80\x99re made for each other\xe2\x80\x94_vous allez\r\nvoir_; and I bless your union.\xe2\x80\x9d It was indeed, after he had gone off,\r\nas if he had been partly serious too. This latter motion had been\r\ndetermined by an enquiry from him about \xe2\x80\x9cJeanne\xe2\x80\x9d; to which her mother\r\nhad replied that she was probably still in the house with Miss Gostrey,\r\nto whom she had lately committed her. \xe2\x80\x9cAh but you know,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man\r\nhad rejoined, \xe2\x80\x9che must see her\xe2\x80\x9d; with which, while Strether pricked up\r\nhis ears, he had started as if to bring her, leaving the other objects\r\nof his interest together. Strether wondered to find Miss Gostrey\r\nalready involved, feeling that he missed a link; but feeling also, with\r\nsmall delay, how much he should like to talk with her of Madame de\r\nVionnet on this basis of evidence.\r\n\r\nThe evidence as yet in truth was meagre; which, for that matter, was\r\nperhaps a little why his expectation had had a drop. There was somehow\r\nnot quite a wealth in her; and a wealth was all that, in his\r\nsimplicity, he had definitely prefigured. Still, it was too much to be\r\nsure already that there was but a poverty. They moved away from the\r\nhouse, and, with eyes on a bench at some distance, he proposed that\r\nthey should sit down. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a great deal about you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said as\r\nthey went; but he had an answer to it that made her stop short. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nabout _you_, Madame de Vionnet, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard, I\xe2\x80\x99m bound to say, almost\r\nnothing\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94those struck him as the only words he himself could utter with\r\nany lucidity; conscious as he was, and as with more reason, of the\r\ndetermination to be in respect to the rest of his business perfectly\r\nplain and go perfectly straight. It hadn\xe2\x80\x99t at any rate been in the\r\nleast his idea to spy on Chad\xe2\x80\x99s proper freedom. It was possibly,\r\nhowever, at this very instant and under the impression of Madame de\r\nVionnet\xe2\x80\x99s pause, that going straight began to announce itself as a\r\nmatter for care. She had only after all to smile at him ever so gently\r\nin order to make him ask himself if he weren\xe2\x80\x99t already going crooked.\r\nIt might be going crooked to find it of a sudden just only clear that\r\nshe intended very definitely to be what he would have called nice to\r\nhim. This was what passed between them while, for another instant, they\r\nstood still; he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t at least remember afterwards what else it\r\nmight have been. The thing indeed really unmistakeable was its rolling\r\nover him as a wave that he had been, in conditions incalculable and\r\nunimaginable, a subject of discussion. He had been, on some ground that\r\nconcerned her, answered for; which gave her an advantage he should\r\nnever be able to match.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t Miss Gostrey,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9csaid a good word for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat had struck him first was the way he was bracketed with that lady;\r\nand he wondered what account Chad would have given of their\r\nacquaintance. Something not as yet traceable, at all events, had\r\nobviously happened. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know of her knowing you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now she\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you all. I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you\xe2\x80\x99re in relation with\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was one of the things\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9call\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Gostrey would now tell\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94that, with every deference to present preoccupation, was uppermost\r\nfor Strether after they had taken their seat. One of the others was, at\r\nthe end of five minutes, that she\xe2\x80\x94oh incontestably, yes\xe2\x80\x94_differed_\r\nless; differed, that is, scarcely at all\xe2\x80\x94well, superficially speaking,\r\nfrom Mrs. Newsome or even from Mrs. Pocock. She was ever so much\r\nyounger than the one and not so young as the other; but what _was_\r\nthere in her, if anything, that would have made it impossible he should\r\nmeet her at Woollett? And wherein was her talk during their moments on\r\nthe bench together not the same as would have been found adequate for a\r\nWoollett garden-party?\xe2\x80\x94unless perhaps truly in not being quite so\r\nbright. She observed to him that Mr. Newsome had, to her knowledge,\r\ntaken extraordinary pleasure in his visit; but there was no good lady\r\nat Woollett who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been at least up to that. Was there in\r\nChad, by chance, after all, deep down, a principle of aboriginal\r\nloyalty that had made him, for sentimental ends, attach himself to\r\nelements, happily encountered, that would remind him most of the old\r\nair and the old soil? Why accordingly be in a flutter\xe2\x80\x94Strether could\r\neven put it that way\xe2\x80\x94about this unfamiliar phenomenon of the _femme du\r\nmonde?_ On these terms Mrs. Newsome herself was as much of one. Little\r\nBilham verily had testified that they came out, the ladies of the type,\r\nin close quarters; but it was just in these quarters\xe2\x80\x94now comparatively\r\nclose\xe2\x80\x94that he felt Madame de Vionnet\xe2\x80\x99s common humanity. She did come\r\nout, and certainly to his relief, but she came out as the usual thing.\r\nThere might be motives behind, but so could there often be even at\r\nWoollett. The only thing was that if she showed him she wished to like\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94as the motives behind might conceivably prompt\xe2\x80\x94it would possibly\r\nhave been more thrilling for him that she should have shown as more\r\nvividly alien. Ah she was neither Turk nor Pole!\xe2\x80\x94which would be indeed\r\nflat once more for Mrs. Newsome and Mrs. Pocock. A lady and two\r\ngentlemen had meanwhile, however, approached their bench, and this\r\naccident stayed for the time further developments.\r\n\r\nThey presently addressed his companion, the brilliant strangers; she\r\nrose to speak to them, and Strether noted how the escorted lady, though\r\nmature and by no means beautiful, had more of the bold high look, the\r\nrange of expensive reference, that he had, as might have been said,\r\nmade his plans for. Madame de Vionnet greeted her as \xe2\x80\x9cDuchesse\xe2\x80\x9d and was\r\ngreeted in turn, while talk started in French, as \xe2\x80\x9cMa toute-belle\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\nlittle facts that had their due, their vivid interest for Strether.\r\nMadame de Vionnet didn\xe2\x80\x99t, none the less, introduce him\xe2\x80\x94a note he was\r\nconscious of as false to the Woollett scale and the Woollett humanity;\r\nthough it didn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent the Duchess, who struck him as confident and\r\nfree, very much what he had obscurely supposed duchesses, from looking\r\nat him as straight and as hard\xe2\x80\x94for it _was_ hard\xe2\x80\x94as if she would have\r\nliked, all the same, to know him. \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, my dear, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s _me_; and who are _you_, with your interesting wrinkles and your\r\nmost effective (is it the handsomest, is it the ugliest?) of\r\nnoses?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94some such loose handful of bright flowers she seemed,\r\nfragrantly enough, to fling at him. Strether almost wondered\xe2\x80\x94at such a\r\npace was he going\xe2\x80\x94if some divination of the influence of either party\r\nwere what determined Madame de Vionnet\xe2\x80\x99s abstention. One of the\r\ngentlemen, in any case, succeeded in placing himself in close relation\r\nwith our friend\xe2\x80\x99s companion; a gentleman rather stout and importantly\r\nshort, in a hat with a wonderful wide curl to its brim and a frock coat\r\nbuttoned with an effect of superlative decision. His French had quickly\r\nturned to equal English, and it occurred to Strether that he might well\r\nbe one of the ambassadors. His design was evidently to assert a claim\r\nto Madame de Vionnet\xe2\x80\x99s undivided countenance, and he made it good in\r\nthe course of a minute\xe2\x80\x94led her away with a trick of three words; a\r\ntrick played with a social art of which Strether, looking after them as\r\nthe four, whose backs were now all turned, moved off, felt himself no\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nHe sank again upon his bench and, while his eyes followed the party,\r\nreflected, as he had done before, on Chad\xe2\x80\x99s strange communities. He sat\r\nthere alone for five minutes, with plenty to think of; above all with\r\nhis sense of having suddenly been dropped by a charming woman overlaid\r\nnow by other impressions and in fact quite cleared and indifferent. He\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet had so quiet a surrender; he didn\xe2\x80\x99t in the least care if\r\nnobody spoke to him more. He might have been, by his attitude, in for\r\nsomething of a march so broad that the want of ceremony with which he\r\nhad just been used could fall into its place as but a minor incident of\r\nthe procession. Besides, there would be incidents enough, as he felt\r\nwhen this term of contemplation was closed by the reappearance of\r\nlittle Bilham, who stood before him a moment with a suggestive \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nin which he saw himself reflected as disorganised, as possibly floored.\r\nHe replied with a \xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d intended to show that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t floored in\r\nthe least. No indeed; he gave it out, as the young man sat down beside\r\nhim, that if, at the worst, he had been overturned at all, he had been\r\noverturned into the upper air, the sublimer element with which he had\r\nan affinity and in which he might be trusted a while to float. It\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t a descent to earth to say after an instant and in sustained\r\nresponse to the reference: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re quite sure her husband\xe2\x80\x99s living?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh then\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh then what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether had after all to think. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for them.\xe2\x80\x9d But it\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t for the moment matter more than that. He assured his young\r\nfriend he was quite content. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stir; were all right as they\r\nwere. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be introduced; had been introduced already\r\nabout as far as he could go. He had seen moreover an immensity; liked\r\nGloriani, who, as Miss Barrace kept saying, was wonderful; had made\r\nout, he was sure, the half-dozen other men who were distinguished, the\r\nartists, the critics and oh the great dramatist\xe2\x80\x94_him_ it was easy to\r\nspot; but wanted\xe2\x80\x94no, thanks, really\xe2\x80\x94to talk with none of them; having\r\nnothing at all to say and finding it would do beautifully as it was; do\r\nbeautifully because what it was\xe2\x80\x94well, was just simply too late. And\r\nwhen after this little Bilham, submissive and responsive, but with an\r\neye to the consolation nearest, easily threw off some \xe2\x80\x9cBetter late than\r\nnever!\xe2\x80\x9d all he got in return for it was a sharp \xe2\x80\x9cBetter early than\r\nlate!\xe2\x80\x9d This note indeed the next thing overflowed for Strether into a\r\nquiet stream of demonstration that as soon as he had let himself go he\r\nfelt as the real relief. It had consciously gathered to a head, but the\r\nreservoir had filled sooner than he knew, and his companion\xe2\x80\x99s touch was\r\nto make the waters spread. There were some things that had to come in\r\ntime if they were to come at all. If they didn\xe2\x80\x99t come in time they were\r\nlost for ever. It was the general sense of them that had overwhelmed\r\nhim with its long slow rush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not too late for _you_, on any side, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t strike me as\r\nin danger of missing the train; besides which people can be in general\r\npretty well trusted, of course\xe2\x80\x94with the clock of their freedom ticking\r\nas loud as it seems to do here\xe2\x80\x94to keep an eye on the fleeting hour. All\r\nthe same don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that you\xe2\x80\x99re young\xe2\x80\x94blessedly young; be glad of it\r\non the contrary and live up to it. Live all you can; it\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake not\r\nto. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t so much matter what you do in particular, so long as you\r\nhave your life. If you haven\xe2\x80\x99t had that what _have_ you had? This place\r\nand these impressions\xe2\x80\x94mild as you may find them to wind a man up so;\r\nall my impressions of Chad and of people I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen at _his_ place\xe2\x80\x94well,\r\nhave had their abundant message for me, have just dropped _that_ into\r\nmy mind. I see it now. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t done so enough before\xe2\x80\x94and now I\xe2\x80\x99m old;\r\ntoo old at any rate for what I see. Oh I _do_ see, at least; and more\r\nthan you\xe2\x80\x99d believe or I can express. It\xe2\x80\x99s too late. And it\xe2\x80\x99s as if the\r\ntrain had fairly waited at the station for me without my having had the\r\ngumption to know it was there. Now I hear its faint receding whistle\r\nmiles and miles down the line. What one loses one loses; make no\r\nmistake about that. The affair\xe2\x80\x94I mean the affair of life\xe2\x80\x94couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, no\r\ndoubt, have been different for me; for it\xe2\x80\x99s at the best a tin mould,\r\neither fluted and embossed, with ornamental excrescences, or else\r\nsmooth and dreadfully plain, into which, a helpless jelly, one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconsciousness is poured\xe2\x80\x94so that one \xe2\x80\x98takes\xe2\x80\x99 the form as the great cook\r\nsays, and is more or less compactly held by it: one lives in fine as\r\none can. Still, one has the illusion of freedom; therefore don\xe2\x80\x99t be,\r\nlike me, without the memory of that illusion. I was either, at the\r\nright time, too stupid or too intelligent to have it; I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite\r\nknow which. Of course at present I\xe2\x80\x99m a case of reaction against the\r\nmistake; and the voice of reaction should, no doubt, always be taken\r\nwith an allowance. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect the point that the right\r\ntime is now yours. The right time is _any_ time that one is still so\r\nlucky as to have. You\xe2\x80\x99ve plenty; that\xe2\x80\x99s the great thing; you\xe2\x80\x99re, as I\r\nsay, damn you, so happily and hatefully young. Don\xe2\x80\x99t at any rate miss\r\nthings out of stupidity. Of course I don\xe2\x80\x99t take you for a fool, or I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be addressing you thus awfully. Do what you like so long as\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t make _my_ mistake. For it was a mistake. Live!\xe2\x80\x9d ... Slowly\r\nand sociably, with full pauses and straight dashes, Strether had so\r\ndelivered himself; holding little Bilham from step to step deeply and\r\ngravely attentive. The end of all was that the young man had turned\r\nquite solemn, and that this was a contradiction of the innocent gaiety\r\nthe speaker had wished to promote. He watched for a moment the\r\nconsequence of his words, and then, laying a hand on his listener\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknee and as if to end with the proper joke: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now for the eye I\r\nshall keep on you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I want to be, at your age, too different from\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh prepare while you\xe2\x80\x99re about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cto be more\r\namusing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham continued to think, but at last had a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\r\n_are_ amusing\xe2\x80\x94to _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Impayable_, as you say, no doubt. But what am I to myself?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether\r\nhad risen with this, giving his attention now to an encounter that, in\r\nthe middle of the garden, was in the act of taking place between their\r\nhost and the lady at whose side Madame de Vionnet had quitted him. This\r\nlady, who appeared within a few minutes to have left her friends,\r\nawaited Gloriani\xe2\x80\x99s eager approach with words on her lips that Strether\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t catch, but of which her interesting witty face seemed to give\r\nhim the echo. He was sure she was prompt and fine, but also that she\r\nhad met her match, and he liked\xe2\x80\x94in the light of what he was quite sure\r\nwas the Duchess\xe2\x80\x99s latent insolence\xe2\x80\x94the good humour with which the great\r\nartist asserted equal resources. Were they, this pair, of the \xe2\x80\x9cgreat\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x9d?\xe2\x80\x94and was he himself, for the moment and thus related to them by\r\nhis observation, _in_ it? Then there was something in the great world\r\ncovertly tigerish, which came to him across the lawn and in the\r\ncharming air as a waft from the jungle. Yet it made him admire most of\r\nthe two, made him envy, the glossy male tiger, magnificently marked.\r\nThese absurdities of the stirred sense, fruits of suggestion ripening\r\non the instant, were all reflected in his next words to little Bilham.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know\xe2\x80\x94if we talk of that\xe2\x80\x94whom _I_ should enjoy being like!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham followed his eyes; but then as with a shade of knowing\r\nsurprise: \xe2\x80\x9cGloriani?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur friend had in fact already hesitated, though not on the hint of his\r\ncompanion\xe2\x80\x99s doubt, in which there were depths of critical reserve. He\r\nhad just made out, in the now full picture, something and somebody\r\nelse; another impression had been superimposed. A young girl in a white\r\ndress and a softly plumed white hat had suddenly come into view, and\r\nwhat was presently clear was that her course was toward them. What was\r\nclearer still was that the handsome young man at her side was Chad\r\nNewsome, and what was clearest of all was that she was therefore\r\nMademoiselle de Vionnet, that she was unmistakeably pretty\xe2\x80\x94bright\r\ngentle shy happy wonderful\xe2\x80\x94and that Chad now, with a consummate\r\ncalculation of effect, was about to present her to his old friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvision. What was clearest of all indeed was something much more than\r\nthis, something at the single stroke of which\xe2\x80\x94and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it simply\r\njuxtaposition?\xe2\x80\x94all vagueness vanished. It was the click of a spring\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nsaw the truth. He had by this time also met Chad\xe2\x80\x99s look; there was more\r\nof it in that; and the truth, accordingly, so far as Bilham\xe2\x80\x99s enquiry\r\nwas concerned, had thrust in the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cOh Chad!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it was that rare\r\nyouth he should have enjoyed being \xe2\x80\x9clike.\xe2\x80\x9d The virtuous attachment\r\nwould be all there before him; the virtuous attachment would be in the\r\nvery act of appeal for his blessing; Jeanne de Vionnet, this charming\r\ncreature, would be exquisitely, intensely now\xe2\x80\x94the object of it. Chad\r\nbrought her straight up to him, and Chad was, oh yes, at this\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x94for the glory of Woollett or whatever\xe2\x80\x94better still even than\r\nGloriani. He had plucked this blossom; he had kept it over-night in\r\nwater; and at last as he held it up to wonder he did enjoy his effect.\r\nThat was why Strether had felt at first the breath of calculation\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwhy moreover, as he now knew, his look at the girl would be, for the\r\nyoung man, a sign of the latter\xe2\x80\x99s success. What young man had ever\r\nparaded about that way, without a reason, a maiden in her flower? And\r\nthere was nothing in his reason at present obscure. Her type\r\nsufficiently told of it\xe2\x80\x94they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, want her to go to\r\nWoollett. Poor Woollett, and what it might miss!\xe2\x80\x94though brave Chad\r\nindeed too, and what it might gain! Brave Chad however had just\r\nexcellently spoken. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a good little friend of mine who knows all\r\nabout you and has moreover a message for you. And this, my dear\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he had\r\nturned to the child herself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cis the best man in the world, who has it\r\nin his power to do a great deal for us and whom I want you to like and\r\nrevere as nearly as possible as much as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stood there quite pink, a little frightened, prettier and prettier\r\nand not a bit like her mother. There was in this last particular no\r\nresemblance but that of youth to youth; and here was in fact suddenly\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s sharpest impression. It went wondering, dazed, embarrassed,\r\nback to the woman he had just been talking with; it was a revelation in\r\nthe light of which he already saw she would become more interesting. So\r\nslim and fresh and fair, she had yet put forth this perfection; so that\r\nfor really believing it of her, for seeing her to any such developed\r\ndegree as a mother, comparison would be urgent. Well, what was it now\r\nbut fairly thrust upon him? \xe2\x80\x9cMamma wishes me to tell you before we go,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe girl said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she hopes very much you\xe2\x80\x99ll come to see us very\r\nsoon. She has something important to say to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe quite reproaches herself,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad helpfully explained: \xe2\x80\x9cyou were\r\ninteresting her so much when she accidentally suffered you to be\r\ninterrupted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh don\xe2\x80\x99t mention it!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether murmured, looking kindly from one to\r\nthe other and wondering at many things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m to ask you for myself,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeanne continued with her hands\r\nclasped together as if in some small learnt prayer\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m to ask you for\r\nmyself if you won\xe2\x80\x99t positively come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave it to me, dear\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of it!\xe2\x80\x9d Chad genially declared in\r\nanswer to this, while Strether himself almost held his breath. What was\r\nin the girl was indeed too soft, too unknown for direct dealing; so\r\nthat one could only gaze at it as at a picture, quite staying one\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nhand. But with Chad he was now on ground\xe2\x80\x94Chad he could meet; so\r\npleasant a confidence in that and in everything did the young man\r\nfreely exhale. There was the whole of a story in his tone to his\r\ncompanion, and he spoke indeed as if already of the family. It made\r\nStrether guess the more quickly what it might be about which Madame de\r\nVionnet was so urgent. Having seen him then she had found him easy; she\r\nwished to have it out with him that some way for the young people must\r\nbe discovered, some way that would not impose as a condition the\r\ntransplantation of her daughter. He already saw himself discussing with\r\nthis lady the attractions of Woollett as a residence for Chad\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompanion. Was that youth going now to trust her with the affair\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nthat it would be after all with one of his \xe2\x80\x9clady-friends\xe2\x80\x9d that his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s missionary should be condemned to deal? It was quite as if for\r\nan instant the two men looked at each other on this question. But there\r\nwas no mistaking at last Chad\xe2\x80\x99s pride in the display of such a\r\nconnexion. This was what had made him so carry himself while, three\r\nminutes before, he was bringing it into view; what had caused his\r\nfriend, first catching sight of him, to be so struck with his air. It\r\nwas, in a word, just when he thus finally felt Chad putting things\r\nstraight off on him that he envied him, as he had mentioned to little\r\nBilham, most. The whole exhibition however was but a matter of three or\r\nfour minutes, and the author of it had soon explained that, as Madame\r\nde Vionnet was immediately going \xe2\x80\x9con,\xe2\x80\x9d this could be for Jeanne but a\r\nsnatch. They would all meet again soon, and Strether was meanwhile to\r\nstay and amuse himself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pick you up again in plenty of time.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\ntook the girl off as he had brought her, and Strether, with the faint\r\nsweet foreignness of her \xe2\x80\x9cAu revoir, monsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d in his ears as a note\r\nalmost unprecedented, watched them recede side by side and felt how,\r\nonce more, her companion\xe2\x80\x99s relation to her got an accent from it. They\r\ndisappeared among the others and apparently into the house; whereupon\r\nour friend turned round to give out to little Bilham the conviction of\r\nwhich he was full. But there was no little Bilham any more; little\r\nBilham had within the few moments, for reasons of his own, proceeded\r\nfurther: a circumstance by which, in its order, Strether was also\r\nsensibly affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n III\r\n\r\nChad was not in fact on this occasion to keep his promise of coming\r\nback; but Miss Gostrey had soon presented herself with an explanation\r\nof his failure. There had been reasons at the last for his going off\r\nwith _ces dames_; and he had asked her with much instance to come out\r\nand take charge of their friend. She did so, Strether felt as she took\r\nher place beside him, in a manner that left nothing to desire. He had\r\ndropped back on his bench, alone again for a time, and the more\r\nconscious for little Bilham\xe2\x80\x99s defection of his unexpressed thought; in\r\nrespect to which however this next converser was a still more capacious\r\nvessel. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the child!\xe2\x80\x9d he had exclaimed to her almost as soon as she\r\nappeared; and though her direct response was for some time delayed he\r\ncould feel in her meanwhile the working of this truth. It might have\r\nbeen simply, as she waited, that they were now in presence altogether\r\nof truth spreading like a flood and not for the moment to be offered\r\nher in the mere cupful; inasmuch as who should _ces dames_ prove to be\r\nbut persons about whom\xe2\x80\x94once thus face to face with them\xe2\x80\x94she found she\r\nmight from the first have told him almost everything? This would have\r\nfreely come had he taken the simple precaution of giving her their\r\nname. There could be no better example\xe2\x80\x94and she appeared to note it with\r\nhigh amusement\xe2\x80\x94than the way, making things out already so much for\r\nhimself, he was at last throwing precautions to the winds. They were\r\nneither more nor less, she and the child\xe2\x80\x99s mother, than old\r\nschool-friends\xe2\x80\x94friends who had scarcely met for years but whom this\r\nunlooked-for chance had brought together with a rush. It was a relief,\r\nMiss Gostrey hinted, to feel herself no longer groping; she was\r\nunaccustomed to grope and as a general thing, he might well have seen,\r\nmade straight enough for her clue. With the one she had now picked up\r\nin her hands there need be at least no waste of wonder. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s coming\r\nto see me\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s for _you_,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether\xe2\x80\x99s counsellor continued; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t require it to know where I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe waste of wonder might be proscribed; but Strether,\r\ncharacteristically, was even by this time in the immensity of space.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy which you mean that you know where _she_ is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe just hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean that if she comes to see me I shall\xe2\x80\x94now\r\nthat I\xe2\x80\x99ve pulled myself round a bit after the shock\xe2\x80\x94not be at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether hung poised. \xe2\x80\x9cYou call it\xe2\x80\x94your recognition\xe2\x80\x94a shock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave one of her rare flickers of impatience. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a surprise, an\r\nemotion. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be so literal. I wash my hands of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Strether\xe2\x80\x99s face lengthened. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s impossible\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s even more charming than I remembered her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had to think how to put it. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, _I\xe2\x80\x99m_ impossible. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimpossible. Everything\xe2\x80\x99s impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cI see where you\xe2\x80\x99re coming out.\r\nEverything\xe2\x80\x99s possible.\xe2\x80\x9d Their eyes had on it in fact an exchange of\r\nsome duration; after which he pursued: \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it that beautiful child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThen as she still said nothing: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you mean to receive her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer answer in an instant rang clear. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I wish to keep out of the\r\nbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt provoked in him a weak wail. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to abandon me _now?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m only going to abandon _her_. She\xe2\x80\x99ll want me to help her with\r\nyou. And I won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll only help me with her? Well then\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d Most of the persons\r\npreviously gathered had, in the interest of tea, passed into the house,\r\nand they had the gardens mainly to themselves. The shadows were long,\r\nthe last call of the birds, who had made a home of their own in the\r\nnoble interspaced quarter, sounded from the high trees in the other\r\ngardens as well, those of the old convent and of the old _h\xc3\xb4tels_; it\r\nwas as if our friends had waited for the full charm to come out.\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s impressions were still present; it was as if something had\r\nhappened that \xe2\x80\x9cnailed\xe2\x80\x9d them, made them more intense; but he was to ask\r\nhimself soon afterwards, that evening, what really _had_\r\nhappened\xe2\x80\x94conscious as he could after all remain that for a gentleman\r\ntaken, and taken the first time, into the \xe2\x80\x9cgreat world,\xe2\x80\x9d the world of\r\nambassadors and duchesses, the items made a meagre total. It was\r\nnothing new to him, however, as we know, that a man might have\xe2\x80\x94at all\r\nevents such a man as he\xe2\x80\x94an amount of experience out of any proportion\r\nto his adventures; so that, though it was doubtless no great adventure\r\nto sit on there with Miss Gostrey and hear about Madame de Vionnet, the\r\nhour, the picture, the immediate, the recent, the possible\xe2\x80\x94as well as\r\nthe communication itself, not a note of which failed to\r\nreverberate\xe2\x80\x94only gave the moments more of the taste of history.\r\n\r\nIt was history, to begin with, that Jeanne\xe2\x80\x99s mother had been\r\nthree-and-twenty years before, at Geneva, schoolmate and good\r\ngirlfriend to Maria Gostrey, who had moreover enjoyed since then,\r\nthough interruptedly and above all with a long recent drop, other\r\nglimpses of her. Twenty-three years put them both on, no doubt; and\r\nMadame de Vionnet\xe2\x80\x94though she had married straight after school\xe2\x80\x94couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe today an hour less than thirty-eight. This made her ten years older\r\nthan Chad\xe2\x80\x94though ten years, also, if Strether liked, older than she\r\nlooked; the least, at any rate, that a prospective mother-in-law could\r\nbe expected to do with. She would be of all mothers-in-law the most\r\ncharming; unless indeed, through some perversity as yet insupposeable,\r\nshe should utterly belie herself in that relation. There was none\r\nsurely in which, as Maria remembered her, she mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be charming; and\r\nthis frankly in spite of the stigma of failure in the tie where failure\r\nalways most showed. It was no test there\xe2\x80\x94when indeed _was_ it a test\r\nthere?\xe2\x80\x94for Monsieur de Vionnet had been a brute. She had lived for\r\nyears apart from him\xe2\x80\x94which was of course always a horrid position; but\r\nMiss Gostrey\xe2\x80\x99s impression of the matter had been that she could scarce\r\nhave made a better thing of it had she done it on purpose to show she\r\nwas amiable. She was so amiable that nobody had had a word to say;\r\nwhich was luckily not the case for her husband. He was so impossible\r\nthat she had the advantage of all her merits.\r\n\r\nIt was still history for Strether that the Comte de Vionnet\xe2\x80\x94it being\r\nalso history that the lady in question was a Countess\xe2\x80\x94should now, under\r\nMiss Gostrey\xe2\x80\x99s sharp touch, rise before him as a high distinguished\r\npolished impertinent reprobate, the product of a mysterious order; it\r\nwas history, further, that the charming girl so freely sketched by his\r\ncompanion should have been married out of hand by a mother, another\r\nfigure of striking outline, full of dark personal motive; it was\r\nperhaps history most of all that this company was, as a matter of\r\ncourse, governed by such considerations as put divorce out of the\r\nquestion. \xe2\x80\x9c_Ces gens-l\xc3\xa0_ don\xe2\x80\x99t divorce, you know, any more than they\r\nemigrate or abjure\xe2\x80\x94they think it impious and vulgar\xe2\x80\x9d; a fact in the\r\nlight of which they seemed but the more richly special. It was all\r\nspecial; it was all, for Strether\xe2\x80\x99s imagination, more or less rich. The\r\ngirl at the Genevese school, an isolated interesting attaching\r\ncreature, then both sensitive and violent, audacious but always\r\nforgiven, was the daughter of a French father and an English mother\r\nwho, early left a widow, had married again\xe2\x80\x94tried afresh with a\r\nforeigner; in her career with whom she had apparently given her child\r\nno example of comfort. All these people\xe2\x80\x94the people of the English\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s side\xe2\x80\x94had been of condition more or less eminent; yet with\r\noddities and disparities that had often since made Maria, thinking them\r\nover, wonder what they really quite rhymed to. It was in any case her\r\nbelief that the mother, interested and prone to adventure, had been\r\nwithout conscience, had only thought of ridding herself most quickly of\r\na possible, an actual encumbrance. The father, by her impression, a\r\nFrenchman with a name one knew, had been a different matter, leaving\r\nhis child, she clearly recalled, a memory all fondness, as well as an\r\nassured little fortune which was unluckily to make her more or less of\r\na prey later on. She had been in particular, at school, dazzlingly,\r\nthough quite booklessly, clever; as polyglot as a little Jewess (which\r\nshe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, oh no!) and chattering French, English, German, Italian,\r\nanything one would, in a way that made a clean sweep, if not of prizes\r\nand parchments, at least of every \xe2\x80\x9cpart,\xe2\x80\x9d whether memorised or\r\nimprovised, in the curtained costumed school repertory, and in especial\r\nof all mysteries of race and vagueness of reference, all swagger about\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chome,\xe2\x80\x9d among their variegated mates.\r\n\r\nIt would doubtless be difficult to-day, as between French and English,\r\nto name her and place her; she would certainly show, on knowledge, Miss\r\nGostrey felt, as one of those convenient types who don\xe2\x80\x99t keep you\r\nexplaining\xe2\x80\x94minds with doors as numerous as the many-tongued cluster of\r\nconfessionals at Saint Peter\xe2\x80\x99s. You might confess to her with\r\nconfidence in Roumelian, and even Roumelian sins. Therefore\xe2\x80\x94! But\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s narrator covered her implication with a laugh; a laugh by\r\nwhich his betrayal of a sense of the lurid in the picture was also\r\nperhaps sufficiently protected. He had a moment of wondering, while his\r\nfriend went on, what sins might be especially Roumelian. She went on at\r\nall events to the mention of her having met the young thing\xe2\x80\x94again by\r\nsome Swiss lake\xe2\x80\x94in her first married state, which had appeared for the\r\nfew intermediate years not at least violently disturbed. She had been\r\nlovely at that moment, delightful to _her_, full of responsive emotion,\r\nof amused recognitions and amusing reminders, and then once more, much\r\nlater, after a long interval, equally but differently charming\xe2\x80\x94touching\r\nand rather mystifying for the five minutes of an encounter at a\r\nrailway-station _en province_, during which it had come out that her\r\nlife was all changed. Miss Gostrey had understood enough to see,\r\nessentially, what had happened, and yet had beautifully dreamed that\r\nshe was herself faultless. There were doubtless depths in her, but she\r\nwas all right; Strether would see if she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. She was another person\r\nhowever\xe2\x80\x94that had been promptly marked\xe2\x80\x94from the small child of nature at\r\nthe Geneva school, a little person quite made over (as foreign women\r\n_were_, compared with American) by marriage. Her situation too had\r\nevidently cleared itself up; there would have been\xe2\x80\x94all that was\r\npossible\xe2\x80\x94a judicial separation. She had settled in Paris, brought up\r\nher daughter, steered her boat. It was no very pleasant boat\xe2\x80\x94especially\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94to be in; but Marie de Vionnet would have headed straight. She\r\nwould have friends, certainly\xe2\x80\x94and very good ones. There she was at all\r\nevents\xe2\x80\x94and it was very interesting. Her knowing Mr. Chad didn\xe2\x80\x99t in the\r\nleast prove she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t friends; what it proved was what good ones _he_\r\nhad. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Gostrey, \xe2\x80\x9cthat night at the Fran\xc3\xa7ais; it\r\ncame out for me in three minutes. I saw _her_\xe2\x80\x94or somebody like her. And\r\nso,\xe2\x80\x9d she immediately added, \xe2\x80\x9cdid you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94not anybody like her!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d he as\r\npromptly went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she has had such an influence on him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey was on her feet; it was time for them to go. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has\r\nbrought him up for her daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir eyes, as so often, in candid conference, through their settled\r\nglasses, met over it long; after which Strether\xe2\x80\x99s again took in the\r\nwhole place. They were quite alone there now. \xe2\x80\x9cMustn\xe2\x80\x99t she rather\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nthe time then\xe2\x80\x94have rushed it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh she won\xe2\x80\x99t of course have lost an hour. But that\xe2\x80\x99s just the good\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x94the good French one. You must remember that of her\xe2\x80\x94that as a\r\nmother she\xe2\x80\x99s French, and that for them there\xe2\x80\x99s a special providence. It\r\nprecisely however\xe2\x80\x94that she mayn\xe2\x80\x99t have been able to begin as far back\r\nas she\xe2\x80\x99d have liked\xe2\x80\x94makes her grateful for aid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether took this in as they slowly moved to the house on their way\r\nout. \xe2\x80\x9cShe counts on me then to put the thing through?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94she counts on you. Oh and first of all of course,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Gostrey\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9con her\xe2\x80\x94well, convincing you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d her friend returned, \xe2\x80\x9cshe caught Chad young!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but there are women who are for all your \xe2\x80\x98times of life.\xe2\x80\x99 They\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nthe most wonderful sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had laughed the words out, but they brought her companion, the next\r\nthing, to a stand. \xe2\x80\x9cIs what you mean that she\xe2\x80\x99ll try to make a fool of\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what she _will_\xe2\x80\x94with an opportunity\xe2\x80\x94make.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you call,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether asked, \xe2\x80\x9can opportunity? My going to see\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh you must go to see her\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Miss Gostrey was a trifle evasive. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t not do that. You\xe2\x80\x99d have gone to see the other woman. I mean if\r\nthere had been one\xe2\x80\x94a different sort. It\xe2\x80\x99s what you came out for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt might be; but Strether distinguished. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t come out to see\r\n_this_ sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had a wonderful look at him now. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you disappointed she isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nworse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe for a moment entertained the question, then found for it the\r\nfrankest of answers. \xe2\x80\x9cYes. If she were worse she\xe2\x80\x99d be better for our\r\npurpose. It would be simpler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d she admitted. \xe2\x80\x9cBut won\xe2\x80\x99t this be pleasanter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he promptly replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t come out\xe2\x80\x94wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that just\r\nwhat you originally reproached me with?\xe2\x80\x94for the pleasant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely. Therefore I say again what I said at first. You must take\r\nthings as they come. Besides,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Gostrey added, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid for\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor yourself\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf your seeing her. I trust her. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing she\xe2\x80\x99ll say about me.\r\nIn fact there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing she _can_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether wondered\xe2\x80\x94little as he had thought of this. Then he broke out.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you women!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something in it at which she flushed. \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94there we are.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re abysses.\xe2\x80\x9d At last she smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I risk her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave himself a shake. \xe2\x80\x9cWell then so do I!\xe2\x80\x9d But he added as they\r\npassed into the house that he would see Chad the first thing in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThis was the next day the more easily effected that the young man, as\r\nit happened, even before he was down, turned up at his hotel. Strether\r\ntook his coffee, by habit, in the public room; but on his descending\r\nfor this purpose Chad instantly proposed an adjournment to what he\r\ncalled greater privacy. He had himself as yet had nothing\xe2\x80\x94they would\r\nsit down somewhere together; and when after a few steps and a turn into\r\nthe Boulevard they had, for their greater privacy, sat down among\r\ntwenty others, our friend saw in his companion\xe2\x80\x99s move a fear of the\r\nadvent of Waymarsh. It was the first time Chad had to that extent given\r\nthis personage \xe2\x80\x9caway\xe2\x80\x9d; and Strether found himself wondering of what it\r\nwas symptomatic. He made out in a moment that the youth was in earnest\r\nas he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet seen him; which in its turn threw a ray perhaps a\r\ntrifle startling on what they had each up to that time been treating as\r\nearnestness. It was sufficiently flattering however that the real\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94if this _was_ at last the real thing\xe2\x80\x94should have been determined,\r\nas appeared, precisely by an accretion of Strether\xe2\x80\x99s importance. For\r\nthis was what it quickly enough came to\xe2\x80\x94that Chad, rising with the\r\nlark, had rushed down to let him know while his morning consciousness\r\nwas yet young that he had literally made the afternoon before a\r\ntremendous impression. Madame de Vionnet wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t rest till\r\nshe should have some assurance from him that he _would_ consent again\r\nto see her. The announcement was made, across their marble-topped\r\ntable, while the foam of the hot milk was in their cups and its plash\r\nstill in the air, with the smile of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s easiest urbanity; and this\r\nexpression of his face caused our friend\xe2\x80\x99s doubts to gather on the spot\r\ninto a challenge of the lips. \xe2\x80\x9cSee here\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that was all; he only for the\r\nmoment said again \xe2\x80\x9cSee here.\xe2\x80\x9d Chad met it with all his air of straight\r\nintelligence, while Strether remembered again that fancy of the first\r\nimpression of him, the happy young Pagan, handsome and hard but oddly\r\nindulgent, whose mysterious measure he had under the street-lamp tried\r\nmentally to take. The young Pagan, while a long look passed between\r\nthem, sufficiently understood. Strether scarce needed at last to say\r\nthe rest\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI want to know where I am.\xe2\x80\x9d But he said it, adding before any\r\nanswer something more. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you engaged to be married\xe2\x80\x94is that your\r\nsecret?\xe2\x80\x94to the young lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad shook his head with the slow amenity that was one of his ways of\r\nconveying that there was time for everything. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no secret\xe2\x80\x94though\r\nI may have secrets! I haven\xe2\x80\x99t at any rate that one. We\xe2\x80\x99re not engaged.\r\nNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen where\xe2\x80\x99s the hitch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean why I haven\xe2\x80\x99t already started with you?\xe2\x80\x9d Chad, beginning\r\nhis coffee and buttering his roll, was quite ready to explain. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing\r\nwould have induced me\xe2\x80\x94nothing will still induce me\xe2\x80\x94not to try to keep\r\nyou here as long as you can be made to stay. It\xe2\x80\x99s too visibly good for\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d Strether had himself plenty to say about this, but it was amusing\r\nalso to measure the march of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s tone. He had never been more a man\r\nof the world, and it was always in his company present to our friend\r\nthat one was seeing how in successive connexions a man of the world\r\nacquitted himself. Chad kept it up beautifully. \xe2\x80\x9cMy idea\xe2\x80\x94_voyons!_\xe2\x80\x94is\r\nsimply that you should let Madame de Vionnet know you, simply that you\r\nshould consent to know _her_. I don\xe2\x80\x99t in the least mind telling you\r\nthat, clever and charming as she is, she\xe2\x80\x99s ever so much in my\r\nconfidence. All I ask of you is to let her talk to you. You\xe2\x80\x99ve asked me\r\nabout what you call my hitch, and so far as it goes she\xe2\x80\x99ll explain it\r\nto you. She\xe2\x80\x99s herself my hitch, hang it\xe2\x80\x94if you must really have it all\r\nout. But in a sense,\xe2\x80\x9d he hastened in the most wonderful manner to add,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat you\xe2\x80\x99ll quite make out for yourself. She\xe2\x80\x99s too good a friend,\r\nconfound her. Too good, I mean, for me to leave without\xe2\x80\x94without\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d It\r\nwas his first hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, without my arranging somehow or other the damnable terms of my\r\nsacrifice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _will_ be a sacrifice then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be the greatest loss I ever suffered. I owe her so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was beautiful, the way Chad said these things, and his plea was now\r\nconfessedly\xe2\x80\x94oh quite flagrantly and publicly\xe2\x80\x94interesting. The moment\r\nreally took on for Strether an intensity. Chad owed Madame de Vionnet\r\nso much? What _did_ that do then but clear up the whole mystery? He was\r\nindebted for alterations, and she was thereby in a position to have\r\nsent in her bill for expenses incurred in reconstruction. What was this\r\nat bottom but what had been to be arrived at? Strether sat there\r\narriving at it while he munched toast and stirred his second cup. To do\r\nthis with the aid of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s pleasant earnest face was also to do more\r\nbesides. No, never before had he been so ready to take him as he was.\r\nWhat was it that had suddenly so cleared up? It was just everybody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharacter; that is everybody\xe2\x80\x99s but\xe2\x80\x94in a measure\xe2\x80\x94his own. Strether felt\r\n_his_ character receive for the instant a smutch from all the wrong\r\nthings he had suspected or believed. The person to whom Chad owed it\r\nthat he could positively turn out such a comfort to other persons\xe2\x80\x94such\r\na person was sufficiently raised above any \xe2\x80\x9cbreath\xe2\x80\x9d by the nature of\r\nher work and the young man\xe2\x80\x99s steady light. All of which was vivid\r\nenough to come and go quickly; though indeed in the midst of it\r\nStrether could utter a question. \xe2\x80\x9cHave I your word of honour that if I\r\nsurrender myself to Madame de Vionnet you\xe2\x80\x99ll surrender yourself to\r\n_me?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad laid his hand firmly on his friend\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear man, you have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was finally something in his felicity almost embarrassing and\r\noppressive\xe2\x80\x94Strether had begun to fidget under it for the open air and\r\nthe erect posture. He had signed to the waiter that he wished to pay,\r\nand this transaction took some moments, during which he thoroughly\r\nfelt, while he put down money and pretended\xe2\x80\x94it was quite hollow\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nestimate change, that Chad\xe2\x80\x99s higher spirit, his youth, his practice,\r\nhis paganism, his felicity, his assurance, his impudence, whatever it\r\nmight be, had consciously scored a success. Well, that was all right so\r\nfar as it went; his sense of the thing in question covered our friend\r\nfor a minute like a veil through which\xe2\x80\x94as if he had been muffled\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nheard his interlocutor ask him if he mightn\xe2\x80\x99t take him over about five.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver\xe2\x80\x9d was over the river, and over the river was where Madame de\r\nVionnet lived, and five was that very afternoon. They got at last out\r\nof the place\xe2\x80\x94got out before he answered. He lighted, in the street, a\r\ncigarette, which again gave him more time. But it was already sharp for\r\nhim that there was no use in time. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does she propose to do to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe had presently demanded.\r\n\r\nChad had no delays. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you afraid of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh immensely. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chad, \xe2\x80\x9cshe won\xe2\x80\x99t do anything worse to you than make you\r\nlike her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just of that I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it\xe2\x80\x99s not fair to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether cast about. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s fair to your mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chad, \xe2\x80\x9care you afraid of _her?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScarcely less. Or perhaps even more. But is this lady against your\r\ninterests at home?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot directly, no doubt; but she\xe2\x80\x99s greatly in favour of them here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98here\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94does she consider them to be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good relations!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith herself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is it that makes them so good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what you\xe2\x80\x99ll make out if you\xe2\x80\x99ll only go, as\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m supplicating you, to see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether stared at him with a little of the wanness, no doubt, that the\r\nvision of more to \xe2\x80\x9cmake out\xe2\x80\x9d could scarce help producing. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean _how_\r\ngood are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh awfully good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Strether had faltered, but it was brief. It was all very well,\r\nbut there was nothing now he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t risk. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, but I must\r\nreally\xe2\x80\x94as I began by telling you\xe2\x80\x94know where I am. Is she bad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Bad\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Chad echoed it, but without a shock. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimplied\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen relations are good?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether felt a little silly, and was even\r\nconscious of a foolish laugh, at having it imposed on him to have\r\nappeared to speak so. What indeed was he talking about? His stare had\r\nrelaxed; he looked now all round him. But something in him brought him\r\nback, though he still didn\xe2\x80\x99t know quite how to turn it. The two or\r\nthree ways he thought of, and one of them in particular, were, even\r\nwith scruples dismissed, too ugly. He none the less at last found\r\nsomething. \xe2\x80\x9cIs her life without reproach?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt struck him, directly he had found it, as pompous and priggish; so\r\nmuch so that he was thankful to Chad for taking it only in the right\r\nspirit. The young man spoke so immensely to the point that the effect\r\nwas practically of positive blandness. \xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely without reproach. A\r\nbeautiful life. _Allez donc voir!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese last words were, in the liberality of their confidence, so\r\nimperative that Strether went through no form of assent; but before\r\nthey separated it had been confirmed that he should be picked up at a\r\nquarter to five.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook Sixth\r\n\r\n\r\n I\r\n\r\nIt was quite by half-past five\xe2\x80\x94after the two men had been together in\r\nMadame de Vionnet\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room not more than a dozen minutes\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nChad, with a look at his watch and then another at their hostess, said\r\ngenially, gaily: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve an engagement, and I know you won\xe2\x80\x99t complain if\r\nI leave him with you. He\xe2\x80\x99ll interest you immensely; and as for her,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ndeclared to Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cI assure you, if you\xe2\x80\x99re at all nervous, she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nperfectly safe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had left them to be embarrassed or not by this guarantee, as they\r\ncould best manage, and embarrassment was a thing that Strether wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nat first sure Madame de Vionnet escaped. He escaped it himself, to his\r\nsurprise; but he had grown used by this time to thinking of himself as\r\nbrazen. She occupied, his hostess, in the Rue de Bellechasse, the first\r\nfloor of an old house to which our visitors had had access from an old\r\nclean court. The court was large and open, full of revelations, for our\r\nfriend, of the habit of privacy, the peace of intervals, the dignity of\r\ndistances and approaches; the house, to his restless sense, was in the\r\nhigh homely style of an elder day, and the ancient Paris that he was\r\nalways looking for\xe2\x80\x94sometimes intensely felt, sometimes more acutely\r\nmissed\xe2\x80\x94was in the immemorial polish of the wide waxed staircase and in\r\nthe fine _boiseries_, the medallions, mouldings, mirrors, great clear\r\nspaces, of the greyish-white salon into which he had been shown. He\r\nseemed at the very outset to see her in the midst of possessions not\r\nvulgarly numerous, but hereditary cherished charming. While his eyes\r\nturned after a little from those of his hostess and Chad freely\r\ntalked\xe2\x80\x94not in the least about _him_, but about other people, people he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know, and quite as if he did know them\xe2\x80\x94he found himself making\r\nout, as a background of the occupant, some glory, some prosperity of\r\nthe First Empire, some Napoleonic glamour, some dim lustre of the great\r\nlegend; elements clinging still to all the consular chairs and\r\nmythological brasses and sphinxes\xe2\x80\x99 heads and faded surfaces of satin\r\nstriped with alternate silk.\r\n\r\nThe place itself went further back\xe2\x80\x94that he guessed, and how old Paris\r\ncontinued in a manner to echo there; but the post-revolutionary period,\r\nthe world he vaguely thought of as the world of Ch\xc3\xa2teaubriand, of\r\nMadame de Sta\xc3\xabl, even of the young Lamartine, had left its stamp of\r\nharps and urns and torches, a stamp impressed on sundry small objects,\r\nornaments and relics. He had never before, to his knowledge, had\r\npresent to him relics, of any special dignity, of a private\r\norder\xe2\x80\x94little old miniatures, medallions, pictures, books; books in\r\nleather bindings, pinkish and greenish, with gilt garlands on the back,\r\nranged, together with other promiscuous properties, under the glass of\r\nbrass-mounted cabinets. His attention took them all tenderly into\r\naccount. They were among the matters that marked Madame de Vionnet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\napartment as something quite different from Miss Gostrey\xe2\x80\x99s little\r\nmuseum of bargains and from Chad\xe2\x80\x99s lovely home; he recognised it as\r\nfounded much more on old accumulations that had possibly from time to\r\ntime shrunken than on any contemporary method of acquisition or form of\r\ncuriosity. Chad and Miss Gostrey had rummaged and purchased and picked\r\nup and exchanged, sifting, selecting, comparing; whereas the mistress\r\nof the scene before him, beautifully passive under the spell of\r\ntransmission\xe2\x80\x94transmission from her father\xe2\x80\x99s line, he quite made up his\r\nmind\xe2\x80\x94had only received, accepted and been quiet. When she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nquiet she had been moved at the most to some occult charity for some\r\nfallen fortune. There had been objects she or her predecessors might\r\neven conceivably have parted with under need, but Strether couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsuspect them of having sold old pieces to get \xe2\x80\x9cbetter\xe2\x80\x9d ones. They would\r\nhave felt no difference as to better or worse. He could but imagine\r\ntheir having felt\xe2\x80\x94perhaps in emigration, in proscription, for his\r\nsketch was slight and confused\xe2\x80\x94the pressure of want or the obligation\r\nof sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of want\xe2\x80\x94whatever might be the case with the other\r\nforce\xe2\x80\x94was, however, presumably not active now, for the tokens of a\r\nchastened ease still abounded after all, many marks of a taste whose\r\ndiscriminations might perhaps have been called eccentric. He guessed at\r\nintense little preferences and sharp little exclusions, a deep\r\nsuspicion of the vulgar and a personal view of the right. The general\r\nresult of this was something for which he had no name on the spot quite\r\nready, but something he would have come nearest to naming in speaking\r\nof it as the air of supreme respectability, the consciousness, small,\r\nstill, reserved, but none the less distinct and diffused, of private\r\nhonour. The air of supreme respectability\xe2\x80\x94that was a strange blank wall\r\nfor his adventure to have brought him to break his nose against. It had\r\nin fact, as he was now aware, filled all the approaches, hovered in the\r\ncourt as he passed, hung on the staircase as he mounted, sounded in the\r\ngrave rumble of the old bell, as little electric as possible, of which\r\nChad, at the door, had pulled the ancient but neatly-kept tassel; it\r\nformed in short the clearest medium of its particular kind that he had\r\never breathed. He would have answered for it at the end of a quarter of\r\nan hour that some of the glass cases contained swords and epaulettes of\r\nancient colonels and generals; medals and orders once pinned over\r\nhearts that had long since ceased to beat; snuff-boxes bestowed on\r\nministers and envoys; copies of works presented, with inscriptions, by\r\nauthors now classic. At bottom of it all for him was the sense of her\r\nrare unlikeness to the women he had known. This sense had grown, since\r\nthe day before, the more he recalled her, and had been above all\r\nsingularly fed by his talk with Chad in the morning. Everything in fine\r\nmade her immeasurably new, and nothing so new as the old house and the\r\nold objects. There were books, two or three, on a small table near his\r\nchair, but they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the lemon-coloured covers with which his eye had\r\nbegun to dally from the hour of his arrival and to the opportunity of a\r\nfurther acquaintance with which he had for a fortnight now altogether\r\nsuccumbed. On another table, across the room, he made out the great\r\n_Revue_; but even that familiar face, conspicuous in Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nparlours, scarce counted here as a modern note. He was sure on the\r\nspot\xe2\x80\x94and he afterwards knew he was right\xe2\x80\x94that this was a touch of\r\nChad\xe2\x80\x99s own hand. What would Mrs. Newsome say to the circumstance that\r\nChad\xe2\x80\x99s interested \xe2\x80\x9cinfluence\xe2\x80\x9d kept her paper-knife in the _Revue_? The\r\ninterested influence at any rate had, as we say, gone straight to the\r\npoint\xe2\x80\x94had in fact soon left it quite behind.\r\n\r\nShe was seated, near the fire, on a small stuffed and fringed chair one\r\nof the few modern articles in the room, and she leaned back in it with\r\nher hands clasped in her lap and no movement, in all her person, but\r\nthe fine prompt play of her deep young face. The fire, under the low\r\nwhite marble, undraped and academic, had burnt down to the silver ashes\r\nof light wood, one of the windows, at a distance, stood open to the\r\nmildness and stillness, out of which, in the short pauses, came the\r\nfaint sound, pleasant and homely, almost rustic, of a plash and a\r\nclatter of _sabots_ from some coach-house on the other side of the\r\ncourt. Madame de Vionnet, while Strether sat there, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to shift her\r\nposture by an inch. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you seriously believe in what you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ndoing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut all the same, you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to treat you\r\nquite as if I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy which you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether directly replied, \xe2\x80\x9cquite as if you\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t! I assure you it won\xe2\x80\x99t make the least difference with me how you\r\ntreat me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, taking that menace bravely and philosophically\r\nenough, \xe2\x80\x9cthe only thing that really matters is that you shall get on\r\nwith me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but I don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d he immediately returned.\r\n\r\nIt gave her another pause; which, however, she happily enough shook\r\noff. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you consent to go on with me a little\xe2\x80\x94provisionally\xe2\x80\x94as if\r\nyou did?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen it was that he saw how she had decidedly come all the way; and\r\nthere accompanied it an extraordinary sense of her raising from\r\nsomewhere below him her beautiful suppliant eyes. He might have been\r\nperched at his door-step or at his window and she standing in the road.\r\nFor a moment he let her stand and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t moreover have spoken. It had\r\nbeen sad, of a sudden, with a sadness that was like a cold breath in\r\nhis face. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I do,\xe2\x80\x9d he finally asked, \xe2\x80\x9cbut listen to you as I\r\npromised Chadwick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you,\xe2\x80\x9d she quickly said, \xe2\x80\x9cisn\xe2\x80\x99t what Mr. Newsome\r\nhad in mind.\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke at present, he saw, as if to take courageously\r\n_all_ her risk. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is my own idea and a different thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt gave poor Strether in truth\xe2\x80\x94uneasy as it made him too\xe2\x80\x94something of\r\nthe thrill of a bold perception justified. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered kindly\r\nenough, \xe2\x80\x9cI was sure a moment since that some idea of your own had come\r\nto you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seemed still to look up at him, but now more serenely. \xe2\x80\x9cI made out\r\nyou were sure\xe2\x80\x94and that helped it to come. So you see,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwe do get on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh but it appears to me I don\xe2\x80\x99t at all meet your request. How can I\r\nwhen I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t at all necessary you should understand; it will do quite well\r\nenough if you simply remember it. Only feel I trust you\xe2\x80\x94and for nothing\r\nso tremendous after all. Just,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a wonderful smile, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\ncommon civility.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether had a long pause while they sat again face to face, as they\r\nhad sat, scarce less conscious, before the poor lady had crossed the\r\nstream. She was the poor lady for Strether now because clearly she had\r\nsome trouble, and her appeal to him could only mean that her trouble\r\nwas deep. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it; it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t his fault; he had done\r\nnothing; but by a turn of the hand she had somehow made their encounter\r\na relation. And the relation profited by a mass of things that were not\r\nstrictly in it or of it; by the very air in which they sat, by the high\r\ncold delicate room, by the world outside and the little plash in the\r\ncourt, by the First Empire and the relics in the stiff cabinets, by\r\nmatters as far off as those and by others as near as the unbroken clasp\r\nof her hands in her lap and the look her expression had of being most\r\nnatural when her eyes were most fixed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou count upon me of course for\r\nsomething really much greater than it sounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh it sounds great enough too!\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed at this.\r\n\r\nHe found himself in time on the point of telling her that she was, as\r\nMiss Barrace called it, wonderful; but, catching himself up, he said\r\nsomething else instead. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it Chad\xe2\x80\x99s idea then that you should\r\nsay to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh his idea was simply what a man\xe2\x80\x99s idea always is\xe2\x80\x94to put every effort\r\noff on the woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98woman\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether slowly echoed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe woman he likes\xe2\x80\x94and just in proportion as he likes her. In\r\nproportion too\xe2\x80\x94for shifting the trouble\xe2\x80\x94as she likes _him_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether followed it; then with an abruptness of his own: \xe2\x80\x9cHow much do\r\nyou like Chad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as much as _that_\xe2\x80\x94to take all, with you, on myself.\xe2\x80\x9d But she got\r\nat once again away from this. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been trembling as if we were to\r\nstand or fall by what you may think of me; and I\xe2\x80\x99m even now,\xe2\x80\x9d she went\r\non wonderfully, \xe2\x80\x9cdrawing a long breath\xe2\x80\x94and, yes, truly taking a great\r\ncourage\xe2\x80\x94from the hope that I don\xe2\x80\x99t in fact strike you as impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s at all events, clearly,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed after an instant, \xe2\x80\x9cthe way\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t strike _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she so far assented, \xe2\x80\x9cas you haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet said you _won\xe2\x80\x99t_ have\r\nthe little patience with me I ask for\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou draw splendid conclusions? Perfectly. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand\r\nthem,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether pursued. \xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to me to ask for much more than you\r\nneed. What, at the worst for you, what at the best for myself, can I\r\nafter all do? I can use no pressure that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t used. You come\r\nreally late with your request. I\xe2\x80\x99ve already done all that for myself\r\nthe case admits of. I\xe2\x80\x99ve said my say, and here I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, here you are, fortunately!\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de Vionnet laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs.\r\nNewsome,\xe2\x80\x9d she added in another tone, \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t think you can do so\r\nlittle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had an hesitation, but he brought the words out. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, she thinks\r\nso now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean by that\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d But she also hung fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I mean what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe still rather faltered. \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me if I touch on it, but if I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsaying extraordinary things, why, perhaps, mayn\xe2\x80\x99t I? Besides, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit properly concern us to know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo know what?\xe2\x80\x9d he insisted as after thus beating about the bush she\r\nhad again dropped.\r\n\r\nShe made the effort. \xe2\x80\x9cHas she given you up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was amazed afterwards to think how simply and quietly he had met it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet.\xe2\x80\x9d It was almost as if he were a trifle disappointed\xe2\x80\x94had\r\nexpected still more of her freedom. But he went straight on. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that\r\nwhat Chad has told you will happen to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was evidently charmed with the way he took it. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you mean if\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve talked of it\xe2\x80\x94most certainly. And the question\xe2\x80\x99s not what has had\r\nleast to do with my wishing to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo judge if I\xe2\x80\x99m the sort of man a woman _can_\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou wonderful gentleman! I do judge\xe2\x80\x94I\r\n_have_ judged. A woman can\xe2\x80\x99t. You\xe2\x80\x99re safe\xe2\x80\x94with every right to be. You\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbe much happier if you\xe2\x80\x99d only believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether was silent a little; then he found himself speaking with a\r\ncynicism of confidence of which even at the moment the sources were\r\nstrange to him. \xe2\x80\x9cI try to believe it. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a marvel,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chow _you_ already get at it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh she was able to say. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember how much I was on the way to it\r\nthrough Mr. Newsome\xe2\x80\x94before I saw you. He thinks everything of your\r\nstrength.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can bear almost anything!\xe2\x80\x9d our friend briskly interrupted.\r\nDeep and beautiful on this her smile came back, and with the effect of\r\nmaking him hear what he had said just as she had heard it. He easily\r\nenough felt that it gave him away, but what in truth had everything\r\ndone but that? It had been all very well to think at moments that he\r\nwas holding her nose down and that he had coerced her: what had he by\r\nthis time done but let her practically see that he accepted their\r\nrelation? What was their relation moreover\xe2\x80\x94though light and brief\r\nenough in form as yet\xe2\x80\x94but whatever she might choose to make it? Nothing\r\ncould prevent her\xe2\x80\x94certainly he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94from making it pleasant. At the\r\nback of his head, behind everything, was the sense that she was\xe2\x80\x94there,\r\nbefore him, close to him, in vivid imperative form\xe2\x80\x94one of the rare\r\nwomen he had so often heard of, read of, thought of, but never met,\r\nwhose very presence, look, voice, the mere contemporaneous _fact_ of\r\nwhom, from the moment it was at all presented, made a relation of mere\r\nrecognition. That was not the kind of woman he had ever found Mrs.\r\nNewsome, a contemporaneous fact who had been distinctly slow to\r\nestablish herself; and at present, confronted with Madame de Vionnet,\r\nhe felt the simplicity of his original impression of Miss Gostrey. She\r\ncertainly had been a fact of rapid growth; but the world was wide, each\r\nday was more and more a new lesson. There were at any rate even among\r\nthe stranger ones relations and relations. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I suit Chad\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrand way,\xe2\x80\x9d he quickly added. \xe2\x80\x9cHe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had much difficulty in working\r\nme in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seemed to deny a little, on the young man\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, by the rise of\r\nher eyebrows, an intention of any process at all inconsiderate. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmust know how grieved he\xe2\x80\x99d be if you were to lose anything. He believes\r\nyou can keep his mother patient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether wondered with his eyes on her. \xe2\x80\x9cI see. _That\xe2\x80\x99s_ then what you\r\nreally want of me. And how am I to do it? Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll tell me that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimply tell her the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you call the truth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, _any_ truth\xe2\x80\x94about us all\xe2\x80\x94that you see yourself. I leave it to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you very much. I like,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether laughed with a slight\r\nharshness, \xe2\x80\x9cthe way you leave things!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she insisted kindly, gently, as if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so bad. \xe2\x80\x9cBe perfectly\r\nhonest. Tell her all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll?\xe2\x80\x9d he oddly echoed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell her the simple truth,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de Vionnet again pleaded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what _is_ the simple truth? The simple truth is exactly what I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ntrying to discover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked about a while, but presently she came back to him. \xe2\x80\x9cTell\r\nher, fully and clearly, about _us_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether meanwhile had been staring. \xe2\x80\x9cYou and your daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94little Jeanne and me. Tell her,\xe2\x80\x9d she just slightly quavered, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nlike us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what good will that do me? Or rather\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he caught himself up\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\ngood will it do _you?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked graver. \xe2\x80\x9cNone, you believe, really?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether debated. \xe2\x80\x9cShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t send me out to \xe2\x80\x98like\xe2\x80\x99 you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she charmingly contended, \xe2\x80\x9cshe sent you out to face the facts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe admitted after an instant that there was something in that. \xe2\x80\x9cBut how\r\ncan I face them till I know what they are? Do you want him,\xe2\x80\x9d he then\r\nbraced himself to ask, \xe2\x80\x9cto marry your daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave a headshake as noble as it was prompt. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94not that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to himself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe repeated the movement, but now with a strange light in her face.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe likes her too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be willing to consider, you mean, the question\r\nof taking her to America?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be willing to do anything with her but be immensely kind and\r\nnice\xe2\x80\x94really tender of her. We watch over her, and you must help us. You\r\nmust see her again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether felt awkward. \xe2\x80\x9cAh with pleasure\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s so remarkably\r\nattractive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mother\xe2\x80\x99s eagerness with which Madame de Vionnet jumped at this was\r\nto come back to him later as beautiful in its grace. \xe2\x80\x9cThe dear thing\r\n_did_ please you?\xe2\x80\x9d Then as he met it with the largest \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d of\r\nenthusiasm: \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s perfect. She\xe2\x80\x99s my joy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that\xe2\x80\x94if one were near her and saw more of her\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\nmine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Vionnet, \xe2\x80\x9ctell Mrs. Newsome that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wondered the more. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat good will that do you?\xe2\x80\x9d As she appeared\r\nunable at once to say, however, he brought out something else. \xe2\x80\x9cIs your\r\ndaughter in love with our friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d she rather startlingly answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d find out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe showed his surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cI? A stranger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you won\xe2\x80\x99t be a stranger\xe2\x80\x94presently. You shall see her quite, I\r\nassure you, as if you weren\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt remained for him none the less an extraordinary notion. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to\r\nme surely that if her mother can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh little girls and their mothers to-day!\xe2\x80\x9d she rather inconsequently\r\nbroke in. But she checked herself with something she seemed to give out\r\nas after all more to the point. \xe2\x80\x9cTell her I\xe2\x80\x99ve been good for him. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou think I have?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt had its effect on him\xe2\x80\x94more than at the moment he quite measured. Yet\r\nhe was consciously enough touched. \xe2\x80\x9cOh if it\xe2\x80\x99s all _you_\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it may not be \xe2\x80\x98all,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s to a great\r\nextent. Really and truly,\xe2\x80\x9d she added in a tone that was to take its\r\nplace with him among things remembered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it\xe2\x80\x99s very wonderful.\xe2\x80\x9d He smiled at her from a face that he felt\r\nas strained, and her own face for a moment kept him so. At last she\r\nalso got up. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think that for that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to save you?\xe2\x80\x9d So it was that the way to meet her\xe2\x80\x94and the way,\r\nas well, in a manner, to get off\xe2\x80\x94came over him. He heard himself use\r\nthe exorbitant word, the very sound of which helped to determine his\r\nflight. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll save you if I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n II\r\n\r\nIn Chad\xe2\x80\x99s lovely home, however, one evening ten days later, he felt\r\nhimself present at the collapse of the question of Jeanne de Vionnet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshy secret. He had been dining there in the company of that young lady\r\nand her mother, as well as of other persons, and he had gone into the\r\n_petit salon_, at Chad\xe2\x80\x99s request, on purpose to talk with her. The\r\nyoung man had put this to him as a favour\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI should like so awfully to\r\nknow what you think of her. It will really be a chance for you,\xe2\x80\x9d he had\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cto see the _jeune fille_\xe2\x80\x94I mean the type\xe2\x80\x94as she actually is, and\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think that, as an observer of manners, it\xe2\x80\x99s a thing you ought\r\nto miss. It will be an impression that\xe2\x80\x94whatever else you take\xe2\x80\x94you can\r\ncarry home with you, where you\xe2\x80\x99ll find again so much to compare it\r\nwith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether knew well enough with what Chad wished him to compare it, and\r\nthough he entirely assented he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet somehow been so deeply\r\nreminded that he was being, as he constantly though mutely expressed\r\nit, used. He was as far as ever from making out exactly to what end;\r\nbut he was none the less constantly accompanied by a sense of the\r\nservice he rendered. He conceived only that this service was highly\r\nagreeable to those who profited by it; and he was indeed still waiting\r\nfor the moment at which he should catch it in the act of proving\r\ndisagreeable, proving in some degree intolerable, to himself. He failed\r\nquite to see how his situation could clear up at all logically except\r\nby some turn of events that would give him the pretext of disgust. He\r\nwas building from day to day on the possibility of disgust, but each\r\nday brought forth meanwhile a new and more engaging bend of the road.\r\nThat possibility was now ever so much further from sight than on the\r\neve of his arrival, and he perfectly felt that, should it come at all,\r\nit would have to be at best inconsequent and violent. He struck himself\r\nas a little nearer to it only when he asked himself what service, in\r\nsuch a life of utility, he was after all rendering Mrs. Newsome. When\r\nhe wished to help himself to believe that he was still all right he\r\nreflected\xe2\x80\x94and in fact with wonder\xe2\x80\x94on the unimpaired frequency of their\r\ncorrespondence; in relation to which what was after all more natural\r\nthan that it should become more frequent just in proportion as their\r\nproblem became more complicated?\r\n\r\nCertain it is at any rate that he now often brought himself balm by the\r\nquestion, with the rich consciousness of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s letter, \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nwhat can I do more than that\xe2\x80\x94what can I do more than tell her\r\neverything?\xe2\x80\x9d To persuade himself that he did tell her, had told her,\r\neverything, he used to try to think of particular things he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t told\r\nher. When at rare moments and in the watches of the night he pounced on\r\none it generally showed itself to be\xe2\x80\x94to a deeper scrutiny\xe2\x80\x94not quite\r\ntruly of the essence. When anything new struck him as coming up, or\r\nanything already noted as reappearing, he always immediately wrote, as\r\nif for fear that if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t he would miss something; and also that he\r\nmight be able to say to himself from time to time \xe2\x80\x9cShe knows it\r\n_now_\xe2\x80\x94even while I worry.\xe2\x80\x9d It was a great comfort to him in general not\r\nto have left past things to be dragged to light and explained; not to\r\nhave to produce at so late a stage anything not produced, or anything\r\neven veiled and attenuated, at the moment. She knew it now: that was\r\nwhat he said to himself to-night in relation to the fresh fact of\r\nChad\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance with the two ladies\xe2\x80\x94not to speak of the fresher one\r\nof his own. Mrs. Newsome knew in other words that very night at\r\nWoollett that he himself knew Madame de Vionnet and that he had\r\nconscientiously been to see her; also that he had found her remarkably\r\nattractive and that there would probably be a good deal more to tell.\r\nBut she further knew, or would know very soon, that, again\r\nconscientiously, he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t repeated his visit; and that when Chad had\r\nasked him on the Countess\xe2\x80\x99s behalf\xe2\x80\x94Strether made her out vividly, with\r\na thought at the back of his head, a Countess\xe2\x80\x94if he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t name a day\r\nfor dining with her, he had replied lucidly: \xe2\x80\x9cThank you very\r\nmuch\xe2\x80\x94impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d He had begged the young man would present his excuses\r\nand had trusted him to understand that it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t really strike one as\r\nquite the straight thing. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t reported to Mrs. Newsome that he\r\nhad promised to \xe2\x80\x9csave\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de Vionnet; but, so far as he was\r\nconcerned with that reminiscence, he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t at any rate promised to\r\nhaunt her house. What Chad had understood could only, in truth, be\r\ninferred from Chad\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour, which had been in this connexion as\r\neasy as in every other. He was easy, always, when he understood; he was\r\neasier still, if possible, when he didn\xe2\x80\x99t; he had replied that he would\r\nmake it all right; and he had proceeded to do this by substituting the\r\npresent occasion\xe2\x80\x94as he was ready to substitute others\xe2\x80\x94for any, for\r\nevery occasion as to which his old friend should have a funny scruple.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh but I\xe2\x80\x99m not a little foreign girl; I\xe2\x80\x99m just as English as I can\r\nbe,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeanne de Vionnet had said to him as soon as, in the _petit\r\nsalon_, he sank, shyly enough on his own side, into the place near her\r\nvacated by Madame Gloriani at his approach. Madame Gloriani, who was in\r\nblack velvet, with white lace and powdered hair, and whose somewhat\r\nmassive majesty melted, at any contact, into the graciousness of some\r\nincomprehensible tongue, moved away to make room for the vague\r\ngentleman, after benevolent greetings to him which embodied, as he\r\nbelieved, in baffling accents, some recognition of his face from a\r\ncouple of Sundays before. Then he had remarked\xe2\x80\x94making the most of the\r\nadvantage of his years\xe2\x80\x94that it frightened him quite enough to find\r\nhimself dedicated to the entertainment of a little foreign girl. There\r\nwere girls he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t afraid of\xe2\x80\x94he was quite bold with little Americans.\r\nThus it was that she had defended herself to the end\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOh but I\xe2\x80\x99m almost\r\nAmerican too. That\xe2\x80\x99s what mamma has wanted me to be\xe2\x80\x94I mean _like_ that;\r\nfor she has wanted me to have lots of freedom. She has known such good\r\nresults from it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was fairly beautiful to him\xe2\x80\x94a faint pastel in an oval frame: he\r\nthought of her already as of some lurking image in a long gallery, the\r\nportrait of a small old-time princess of whom nothing was known but\r\nthat she had died young. Little Jeanne wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, doubtless, to die young,\r\nbut one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, all the same, bear on her lightly enough. It was\r\nbearing hard, it was bearing as _he_, in any case, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear, to\r\nconcern himself, in relation to her, with the question of a young man.\r\nOdious really the question of a young man; one didn\xe2\x80\x99t treat such a\r\nperson as a maid-servant suspected of a \xe2\x80\x9cfollower.\xe2\x80\x9d And then young men,\r\nyoung men\xe2\x80\x94well, the thing was their business simply, or was at all\r\nevents hers. She was fluttered, fairly fevered\xe2\x80\x94to the point of a little\r\nglitter that came and went in her eyes and a pair of pink spots that\r\nstayed in her cheeks\xe2\x80\x94with the great adventure of dining out and with\r\nthe greater one still, possibly, of finding a gentleman whom she must\r\nthink of as very, very old, a gentleman with eye-glasses, wrinkles, a\r\nlong grizzled moustache. She spoke the prettiest English, our friend\r\nthought, that he had ever heard spoken, just as he had believed her a\r\nfew minutes before to be speaking the prettiest French. He wondered\r\nalmost wistfully if such a sweep of the lyre didn\xe2\x80\x99t react on the spirit\r\nitself; and his fancy had in fact, before he knew it, begun so to stray\r\nand embroider that he finally found himself, absent and extravagant,\r\nsitting with the child in a friendly silence. Only by this time he felt\r\nher flutter to have fortunately dropped and that she was more at her\r\nease. She trusted him, liked him, and it was to come back to him\r\nafterwards that she had told him things. She had dipped into the\r\nwaiting medium at last and found neither surge nor chill\xe2\x80\x94nothing but\r\nthe small splash she could herself make in the pleasant warmth, nothing\r\nbut the safety of dipping and dipping again. At the end of the ten\r\nminutes he was to spend with her his impression\xe2\x80\x94with all it had thrown\r\noff and all it had taken in\xe2\x80\x94was complete. She had been free, as she\r\nknew freedom, partly to show him that, unlike other little persons she\r\nknew, she had imbibed that ideal. She was delightfully quaint about\r\nherself, but the vision of what she had imbibed was what most held him.\r\nIt really consisted, he was soon enough to feel, in just one great\r\nlittle matter, the fact that, whatever her nature, she was\r\nthoroughly\xe2\x80\x94he had to cast about for the word, but it came\xe2\x80\x94bred. He\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t of course on so short an acquaintance speak for her nature,\r\nbut the idea of breeding was what she had meanwhile dropped into his\r\nmind. He had never yet known it so sharply presented. Her mother gave\r\nit, no doubt; but her mother, to make that less sensible, gave so much\r\nelse besides, and on neither of the two previous occasions,\r\nextraordinary woman, Strether felt, anything like what she was giving\r\ntonight. Little Jeanne was a case, an exquisite case of education;\r\nwhereas the Countess, whom it so amused him to think of by that\r\ndenomination, was a case, also exquisite, of\xe2\x80\x94well, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has wonderful taste, _notre jeune homme_\xe2\x80\x9d: this was what Gloriani\r\nsaid to him on turning away from the inspection of a small picture\r\nsuspended near the door of the room. The high celebrity in question had\r\njust come in, apparently in search of Mademoiselle de Vionnet, but\r\nwhile Strether had got up from beside her their fellow guest, with his\r\neye sharply caught, had paused for a long look. The thing was a\r\nlandscape, of no size, but of the French school, as our friend was glad\r\nto feel he knew, and also of a quality\xe2\x80\x94which he liked to think he\r\nshould also have guessed; its frame was large out of proportion to the\r\ncanvas, and he had never seen a person look at anything, he thought,\r\njust as Gloriani, with his nose very near and quick movements of the\r\nhead from side to side and bottom to top, examined this feature of\r\nChad\xe2\x80\x99s collection. The artist used that word the next moment smiling\r\ncourteously, wiping his nippers and looking round him further\xe2\x80\x94paying\r\nthe place in short by the very manner of his presence and by something\r\nStrether fancied he could make out in this particular glance, such a\r\ntribute as, to the latter\xe2\x80\x99s sense, settled many things once for all.\r\nStrether was conscious at this instant, for that matter, as he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyet been, of how, round about him, quite without him, they _were_\r\nconsistently settled. Gloriani\xe2\x80\x99s smile, deeply Italian, he considered,\r\nand finely inscrutable, had had for him, during dinner, at which they\r\nwere not neighbours, an indefinite greeting; but the quality in it was\r\ngone that had appeared on the other occasion to turn him inside out; it\r\nwas as if even the momentary link supplied by the doubt between them\r\nhad snapped. He was conscious now of the final reality, which was that\r\nthere wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so much a doubt as a difference altogether; all the more\r\nthat over the difference the famous sculptor seemed to signal almost\r\ncondolingly, yet oh how vacantly! as across some great flat sheet of\r\nwater. He threw out the bridge of a charming hollow civility on which\r\nStrether wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have trusted his own full weight a moment. That idea,\r\neven though but transient and perhaps belated, had performed the office\r\nof putting Strether more at his ease, and the blurred picture had\r\nalready dropped\xe2\x80\x94dropped with the sound of something else said and with\r\nhis becoming aware, by another quick turn, that Gloriani was now on the\r\nsofa talking with Jeanne, while he himself had in his ears again the\r\nfamiliar friendliness and the elusive meaning of the \xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh, oh!\xe2\x80\x9d that\r\nhad made him, a fortnight before, challenge Miss Barrace in vain. She\r\nhad always the air, this picturesque and original lady, who struck him,\r\nso oddly, as both antique and modern\xe2\x80\x94she had always the air of taking\r\nup some joke that one had already had out with her. The point itself,\r\nno doubt, was what was antique, and the use she made of it what was\r\nmodern. He felt just now that her good-natured irony did bear on\r\nsomething, and it troubled him a little that she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more\r\nexplicit only assuring him, with the pleasure of observation so visible\r\nin her, that she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell him more for the world. He could take\r\nrefuge but in asking her what she had done with Waymarsh, though it\r\nmust be added that he felt himself a little on the way to a clue after\r\nshe had answered that this personage was, in the other room, engaged in\r\nconversation with Madame de Vionnet. He stared a moment at the image of\r\nsuch a conjunction; then, for Miss Barrace\xe2\x80\x99s benefit, he wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nshe too then under the charm\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not a bit\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Miss Barrace was prompt. \xe2\x80\x9cShe makes nothing of him.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s bored. She won\xe2\x80\x99t help you with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cshe can\xe2\x80\x99t do everything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not\xe2\x80\x94wonderful as she is. Besides, he makes nothing of _her_.\r\nShe won\xe2\x80\x99t take him from me\xe2\x80\x94though she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, no doubt, having other\r\naffairs in hand, even if she could. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Barrace,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cseen her fail with any one before. And to-night, when she\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\nmagnificent, it would seem to her strange\xe2\x80\x94if she minded. So at any rate\r\nI have him all. _Je suis tranquille!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether understood, so far as that went; but he was feeling for his\r\nclue. \xe2\x80\x9cShe strikes you to-night as particularly magnificent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely. Almost as I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen her. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t she you? Why it\xe2\x80\x99s _for_\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe persisted in his candour. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98For\xe2\x80\x99 me\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh, oh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Barrace, who persisted in the opposite of that\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he acutely admitted, \xe2\x80\x9cshe _is_ different. She\xe2\x80\x99s gay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s gay!\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Barrace laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd she has beautiful\r\nshoulders\xe2\x80\x94though there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing different in that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cone was sure of her shoulders. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t her\r\nshoulders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion, with renewed mirth and the finest sense, between the\r\npuffs of her cigarette, of the drollery of things, appeared to find\r\ntheir conversation highly delightful. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t her shoulders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat then is it?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether earnestly enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s _she_\xe2\x80\x94simply. It\xe2\x80\x99s her mood. It\xe2\x80\x99s her charm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it\xe2\x80\x99s her charm, but we\xe2\x80\x99re speaking of the difference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Barrace explained, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s just brilliant, as we used to\r\nsay. That\xe2\x80\x99s all. She\xe2\x80\x99s various. She\xe2\x80\x99s fifty women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but only one\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Strether kept it clear\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cat a time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps. But in fifty times\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh we shan\xe2\x80\x99t come to that,\xe2\x80\x9d our friend declared; and the next moment\r\nhe had moved in another direction. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you answer me a plain\r\nquestion? Will she ever divorce?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barrace looked at him through all her tortoise-shell. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should\r\nshe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t what he had asked for, he signified; but he met it well\r\nenough. \xe2\x80\x9cTo marry Chad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should she marry Chad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I\xe2\x80\x99m convinced she\xe2\x80\x99s very fond of him. She has done wonders for\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, how could she do more? Marrying a man, or woman either,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMiss Barrace sagely went on, \xe2\x80\x9cis never the wonder for any Jack and Jill\r\ncan bring _that_ off. The wonder is their doing such things without\r\nmarrying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether considered a moment this proposition. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean it\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\nbeautiful for our friends simply to go on so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut whatever he said made her laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nevertheless insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd _that_ because it\xe2\x80\x99s disinterested?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was now, however, suddenly tired of the question. \xe2\x80\x9cYes then\xe2\x80\x94call it\r\nthat. Besides, she\xe2\x80\x99ll never divorce. Don\xe2\x80\x99t, moreover,\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbelieve everything you hear about her husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not then,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether asked, \xe2\x80\x9ca wretch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes. But charming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve met him. He\xe2\x80\x99s _bien aimable_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo every one but his wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh for all I know, to her too\xe2\x80\x94to any, to every woman. I hope you at\r\nany rate,\xe2\x80\x9d she pursued with a quick change, \xe2\x80\x9cappreciate the care I take\r\nof Mr. Waymarsh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh immensely.\xe2\x80\x9d But Strether was not yet in line. \xe2\x80\x9cAt all events,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nroundly brought out, \xe2\x80\x9cthe attachment\xe2\x80\x99s an innocent one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine and his? Ah,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t rob it of _all_ interest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean our friend\xe2\x80\x99s here\xe2\x80\x94to the lady we\xe2\x80\x99ve been speaking of.\xe2\x80\x9d That was\r\nwhat he had settled to as an indirect but none the less closely\r\ninvolved consequence of his impression of Jeanne. That was where he\r\nmeant to stay. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s innocent,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI see the whole thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMystified by his abrupt declaration, she had glanced over at Gloriani\r\nas at the unnamed subject of his allusion, but the next moment she had\r\nunderstood; though indeed not before Strether had noticed her momentary\r\nmistake and wondered what might possibly be behind that too. He already\r\nknew that the sculptor admired Madame de Vionnet; but did this\r\nadmiration also represent an attachment of which the innocence was\r\ndiscussable? He was moving verily in a strange air and on ground not of\r\nthe firmest. He looked hard for an instant at Miss Barrace, but she had\r\nalready gone on. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right with Mr. Newsome? Why of course she\r\nis!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and she got gaily back to the question of her own good friend. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndare say you\xe2\x80\x99re surprised that I\xe2\x80\x99m not worn out with all I see\xe2\x80\x94it being\r\nso much!\xe2\x80\x94of Sitting Bull. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not, you know\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind him; I\r\nbear up, and we get on beautifully. I\xe2\x80\x99m very strange; I\xe2\x80\x99m like that;\r\nand often I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain. There are people who are supposed\r\ninteresting or remarkable or whatever, and who bore me to death; and\r\nthen there are others as to whom nobody can understand what anybody\r\nsees in them\xe2\x80\x94in whom I see no end of things.\xe2\x80\x9d Then after she had smoked\r\na moment, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s touching, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Know\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether echoed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t I, indeed? We must move you almost to\r\ntears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh but I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean _you!_\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to then, for the worst sign of all\xe2\x80\x94as I must have it for\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94is that you can\xe2\x80\x99t help me. That\xe2\x80\x99s when a woman pities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but I do help you!\xe2\x80\x9d she cheerfully insisted.\r\n\r\nAgain he looked at her hard, and then after a pause: \xe2\x80\x9cNo you don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer tortoise-shell, on its long chain, rattled down. \xe2\x80\x9cI help you with\r\nSitting Bull. That\xe2\x80\x99s a good deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh that, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d But Strether hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean he talks of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that I have to defend you? No, never.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether mused. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too deep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s his only fault,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat everything, with him, is\r\ntoo deep. He has depths of silence\xe2\x80\x94which he breaks only at the longest\r\nintervals by a remark. And when the remark comes it\xe2\x80\x99s always something\r\nhe has seen or felt for himself\xe2\x80\x94never a bit banal. _That_ would be what\r\none might have feared and what would kill me. But never.\xe2\x80\x9d She smoked\r\nagain as she thus, with amused complacency, appreciated her\r\nacquisition. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd never about you. We keep clear of you. We\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nwonderful. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what he does do,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued: \xe2\x80\x9che tries\r\nto make me presents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPresents?\xe2\x80\x9d poor Strether echoed, conscious with a pang that _he_\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet tried that in any quarter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy you see,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s as fine as ever in the victoria; so\r\nthat when I leave him, as I often do almost for hours\xe2\x80\x94he likes it so\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nthe doors of shops, the sight of him there helps me, when I come out,\r\nto know my carriage away off in the rank. But sometimes, for a change,\r\nhe goes with me into the shops, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ve all I can do to prevent\r\nhis buying me things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wants to \xe2\x80\x98treat\xe2\x80\x99 you?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether almost gasped at all he himself\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought of. He had a sense of admiration. \xe2\x80\x9cOh he\xe2\x80\x99s much more in\r\nthe real tradition than I. Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he mused, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s the sacred rage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sacred rage, exactly!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and Miss Barrace, who hadn\xe2\x80\x99t before heard\r\nthis term applied, recognised its bearing with a clap of her gemmed\r\nhands. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I do know why he\xe2\x80\x99s not banal. But I do prevent him all the\r\nsame\xe2\x80\x94and if you saw what he sometimes selects\xe2\x80\x94from buying. I save him\r\nhundreds and hundreds. I only take flowers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlowers?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether echoed again with a rueful reflexion. How many\r\nnosegays had her present converser sent?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInnocent flowers,\xe2\x80\x9d she pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cas much as he likes. And he sends me\r\nsplendours; he knows all the best places\xe2\x80\x94he has found them for himself;\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t told them to _me_,\xe2\x80\x9d her friend smiled, \xe2\x80\x9che has a life of his\r\nown.\xe2\x80\x9d But Strether had swung back to the consciousness that for himself\r\nafter all it never would have done. Waymarsh hadn\xe2\x80\x99t Mrs. Waymarsh in\r\nthe least to consider, whereas Lambert Strether had constantly, in the\r\ninmost honour of his thoughts, to consider Mrs. Newsome. He liked\r\nmoreover to feel how much his friend was in the real tradition. Yet he\r\nhad his conclusion. \xe2\x80\x9c_What_ a rage it is!\xe2\x80\x9d He had worked it out. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nan opposition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe followed, but at a distance. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I feel. Yet to what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he thinks, you know, that _I\xe2\x80\x99ve_ a life of my own. And I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d She showed doubt, and her laugh confirmed it. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh,\r\noh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94not for myself. I seem to have a life only for other people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh for them and _with_ them! Just now for instance with\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, with whom?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked before she had had time to say.\r\n\r\nHis tone had the effect of making her hesitate and even, as he guessed,\r\nspeak with a difference. \xe2\x80\x9cSay with Miss Gostrey. What do you do for\r\n_her?_\xe2\x80\x9d It really made him wonder. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n III\r\n\r\nMadame de Vionnet, having meanwhile come in, was at present close to\r\nthem, and Miss Barrace hereupon, instead of risking a rejoinder, became\r\nagain with a look that measured her from top to toe all mere\r\nlong-handled appreciative tortoise-shell. She had struck our friend,\r\nfrom the first of her appearing, as dressed for a great occasion, and\r\nshe met still more than on either of the others the conception\r\nreawakened in him at their garden-party, the idea of the _femme du\r\nmonde_ in her habit as she lived. Her bare shoulders and arms were\r\nwhite and beautiful; the materials of her dress, a mixture, as he\r\nsupposed, of silk and crape, were of a silvery grey so artfully\r\ncomposed as to give an impression of warm splendour; and round her neck\r\nshe wore a collar of large old emeralds, the green note of which was\r\nmore dimly repeated, at other points of her apparel, in embroidery, in\r\nenamel, in satin, in substances and textures vaguely rich. Her head,\r\nextremely fair and exquisitely festal, was like a happy fancy, a notion\r\nof the antique, on an old precious medal, some silver coin of the\r\nRenaissance; while her slim lightness and brightness, her gaiety, her\r\nexpression, her decision, contributed to an effect that might have been\r\nfelt by a poet as half mythological and half conventional. He could\r\nhave compared her to a goddess still partly engaged in a morning cloud,\r\nor to a sea-nymph waist-high in the summer surge. Above all she\r\nsuggested to him the reflexion that the _femme du monde_\xe2\x80\x94in these\r\nfinest developments of the type\xe2\x80\x94was, like Cleopatra in the play, indeed\r\nvarious and multifold. She had aspects, characters, days, nights\xe2\x80\x94or had\r\nthem at least, showed them by a mysterious law of her own, when in\r\naddition to everything she happened also to be a woman of genius. She\r\nwas an obscure person, a muffled person one day, and a showy person, an\r\nuncovered person the next. He thought of Madame de Vionnet to-night as\r\nshowy and uncovered, though he felt the formula rough, because, thanks\r\nto one of the short-cuts of genius she had taken all his categories by\r\nsurprise. Twice during dinner he had met Chad\xe2\x80\x99s eyes in a longish look;\r\nbut these communications had in truth only stirred up again old\r\nambiguities\xe2\x80\x94so little was it clear from them whether they were an\r\nappeal or an admonition. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see how I\xe2\x80\x99m fixed,\xe2\x80\x9d was what they\r\nappeared to convey; yet how he was fixed was exactly what Strether\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t see. However, perhaps he should see now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you capable of the very great kindness of going to relieve\r\nNewsome, for a few minutes, of the rather crushing responsibility of\r\nMadame Gloriani, while I say a word, if he\xe2\x80\x99ll allow me, to Mr.\r\nStrether, of whom I\xe2\x80\x99ve a question to ask? Our host ought to talk a bit\r\nto those other ladies, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back in a minute to your rescue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe made this proposal to Miss Barrace as if her consciousness of a\r\nspecial duty had just flickered-up, but that lady\xe2\x80\x99s recognition of\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s little start at it\xe2\x80\x94as at a betrayal on the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s part of\r\na domesticated state\xe2\x80\x94was as mute as his own comment; and after an\r\ninstant, when their fellow guest had good-naturedly left them, he had\r\nbeen given something else to think of. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy has Maria so suddenly gone?\r\nDo you know?\xe2\x80\x9d That was the question Madame de Vionnet had brought with\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99ve no reason to give you but the simple reason I\xe2\x80\x99ve had\r\nfrom her in a note\xe2\x80\x94the sudden obligation to join in the south a sick\r\nfriend who has got worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh then she has been writing you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot since she went\xe2\x80\x94I had only a brief explanatory word before she\r\nstarted. I went to see her,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether explained\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit was the day after I\r\ncalled on you\xe2\x80\x94but she was already on her way, and her concierge told me\r\nthat in case of my coming I was to be informed she had written to me. I\r\nfound her note when I got home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Vionnet listened with interest and with her eyes on\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s face; then her delicately decorated head had a small\r\nmelancholy motion. \xe2\x80\x9cShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t write to _me_. I went to see her,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9calmost immediately after I had seen you, and as I assured her I\r\nwould do when I met her at Gloriani\xe2\x80\x99s. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t then told me she was\r\nto be absent, and I felt at her door as if I understood. She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabsent\xe2\x80\x94with all respect to her sick friend, though I know indeed she\r\nhas plenty\xe2\x80\x94so that I may not see her. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to meet me\r\nagain. Well,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued with a beautiful conscious mildness, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nliked and admired her beyond every one in the old time, and she knew\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94perhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s precisely what has made her go\xe2\x80\x94and I dare say I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t lost her for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d Strether still said nothing; he had a\r\nhorror, as he now thought of himself, of being in question between\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x94was in fact already quite enough on his way to that, and there\r\nwas moreover, as it came to him, perceptibly, something behind these\r\nallusions and professions that, should he take it in, would square but\r\nill with his present resolve to simplify. It was as if, for him, all\r\nthe same, her softness and sadness were sincere. He felt that not less\r\nwhen she soon went on: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m extremely glad of her happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d But it\r\nalso left him mute\xe2\x80\x94sharp and fine though the imputation it conveyed.\r\nWhat it conveyed was that _he_ was Maria Gostrey\xe2\x80\x99s happiness, and for\r\nthe least little instant he had the impulse to challenge the thought.\r\nHe could have done so however only by saying \xe2\x80\x9cWhat then do you suppose\r\nto be between us?\xe2\x80\x9d and he was wonderfully glad a moment later not to\r\nhave spoken. He would rather seem stupid any day than fatuous, and he\r\ndrew back as well, with a smothered inward shudder, from the\r\nconsideration of what women\xe2\x80\x94of highly-developed type in\r\nparticular\xe2\x80\x94might think of each other. Whatever he had come out for he\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t come to go into that; so that he absolutely took up nothing his\r\ninterlocutress had now let drop. Yet, though he had kept away from her\r\nfor days, had laid wholly on herself the burden of their meeting again,\r\nshe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a gleam of irritation to show him. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, about Jeanne now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe smiled\xe2\x80\x94it had the gaiety with which she had originally come in. He\r\nfelt it on the instant to represent her motive and real errand. But he\r\nhad been schooling her of a truth to say much in proportion to his\r\nlittle. \xe2\x80\x9c_Do_ you make out that she has a sentiment? I mean for Mr.\r\nNewsome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlmost resentful, Strether could at last be prompt. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I make out\r\nsuch things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe remained perfectly good-natured. \xe2\x80\x9cAh but they\xe2\x80\x99re beautiful little\r\nthings, and you make out\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend\xe2\x80\x94everything in the world. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cbeen talking with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but not about Chad. At least not much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you don\xe2\x80\x99t require \xe2\x80\x98much\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d she reassuringly declared. But she\r\nimmediately changed her ground. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you remember your promise of\r\nthe other day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo \xe2\x80\x98save\xe2\x80\x99 you, as you called it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI call it so still. You _will?_\xe2\x80\x9d she insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t repented?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94but I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking what I meant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe kept it up. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd not, a little, what _I_ did?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary. It will be enough if I know what I meant\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cby this time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain he had a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cI think you ought to leave it to me. But how\r\nlong,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you give me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me much more a question of how long you give _me_. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nour friend here himself, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cperpetually make\r\nme present to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether replied, \xe2\x80\x9cby ever speaking of you to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe never does that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe considered, and, if the fact was disconcerting to her, effectually\r\nconcealed it. The next minute indeed she had recovered. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, he\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. But do you _need_ that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer emphasis was wonderful, and though his eyes had been wandering he\r\nlooked at her longer now. \xe2\x80\x9cI see what you mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you see what I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer triumph was gentle, and she really had tones to make justice weep.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve before me what he owes you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdmit then that that\xe2\x80\x99s something,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, yet still with the same\r\ndiscretion in her pride.\r\n\r\nHe took in this note but went straight on. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve made of him what I\r\nsee, but what I don\xe2\x80\x99t see is how in the world you\xe2\x80\x99ve done it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh that\xe2\x80\x99s another question!\xe2\x80\x9d she smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cThe point is of what use is\r\nyour declining to know me when to know Mr. Newsome\xe2\x80\x94as you do me the\r\nhonour to find him\xe2\x80\x94_is_ just to know me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d he mused, still with his eyes on her. \xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have met\r\nyou to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe raised and dropped her linked hands. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. If I trust\r\nyou why can\xe2\x80\x99t you a little trust me too? And why can\xe2\x80\x99t you also,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked in another tone, \xe2\x80\x9ctrust yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d But she gave him no time to\r\nreply. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I shall be so easy for you! And I\xe2\x80\x99m glad at any rate you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nseen my child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad too,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut she does you no good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo good?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Madame de Vionnet had a clear stare. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy she\xe2\x80\x99s an angel of\r\nlight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s precisely the reason. Leave her alone. Don\xe2\x80\x99t try to find out. I\r\nmean,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, \xe2\x80\x9cabout what you spoke to me of\xe2\x80\x94the way she feels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause one really won\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, because I ask you, as a favour to myself, not to. She\xe2\x80\x99s the most\r\ncharming creature I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen. Therefore don\xe2\x80\x99t touch her. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know. And moreover\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94you _won\xe2\x80\x99t_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was an appeal, of a sudden, and she took it in. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a favour to\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94since you ask me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything, everything you ask,\xe2\x80\x9d she smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t know then\xe2\x80\x94never.\r\nThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d she added with peculiar gentleness as she turned away.\r\n\r\nThe sound of it lingered with him, making him fairly feel as if he had\r\nbeen tripped up and had a fall. In the very act of arranging with her\r\nfor his independence he had, under pressure from a particular\r\nperception, inconsistently, quite stupidly, committed himself, and,\r\nwith her subtlety sensitive on the spot to an advantage, she had driven\r\nin by a single word a little golden nail, the sharp intention of which\r\nhe signally felt. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t detached, he had more closely connected\r\nhimself, and his eyes, as he considered with some intensity this\r\ncircumstance, met another pair which had just come within their range\r\nand which struck him as reflecting his sense of what he had done. He\r\nrecognised them at the same moment as those of little Bilham, who had\r\napparently drawn near on purpose to speak to him, and little Bilham\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t, in the conditions, the person to whom his heart would be most\r\nclosed. They were seated together a minute later at the angle of the\r\nroom obliquely opposite the corner in which Gloriani was still engaged\r\nwith Jeanne de Vionnet, to whom at first and in silence their attention\r\nhad been benevolently given. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t see for my life,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether had\r\nthen observed, \xe2\x80\x9chow a young fellow of any spirit\xe2\x80\x94such a one as you for\r\ninstance\xe2\x80\x94can be admitted to the sight of that young lady without being\r\nhard hit. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you go in, little Bilham?\xe2\x80\x9d He remembered the tone\r\ninto which he had been betrayed on the garden-bench at the sculptor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreception, and this might make up for that by being much more the right\r\nsort of thing to say to a young man worthy of any advice at all. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\n_would_ be some reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome reason for what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy for hanging on here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo offer my hand and fortune to Mademoiselle de Vionnet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether asked, \xe2\x80\x9cto what lovelier apparition _could_ you offer\r\nthem? She\xe2\x80\x99s the sweetest little thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s certainly immense. I mean she\xe2\x80\x99s the real thing. I believe the\r\npale pink petals are folded up there for some wondrous efflorescence in\r\ntime; to open, that is, to some great golden sun. _I\xe2\x80\x99m_ unfortunately\r\nbut a small farthing candle. What chance in such a field for a poor\r\nlittle painter-man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you\xe2\x80\x99re good enough,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether threw out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I\xe2\x80\x99m good enough. We\xe2\x80\x99re good enough, I consider, _nous\r\nautres_, for anything. But she\xe2\x80\x99s _too_ good. There\xe2\x80\x99s the difference.\r\nThey wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether, lounging on his divan and still charmed by the young girl,\r\nwhose eyes had consciously strayed to him, he fancied, with a vague\r\nsmile\xe2\x80\x94Strether, enjoying the whole occasion as with dormant pulses at\r\nlast awake and in spite of new material thrust upon him, thought over\r\nhis companion\xe2\x80\x99s words. \xe2\x80\x9cWhom do you mean by \xe2\x80\x98they\xe2\x80\x99? She and her\r\nmother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe and her mother. And she has a father too, who, whatever else he\r\nmay be, certainly can\xe2\x80\x99t be indifferent to the possibilities she\r\nrepresents. Besides, there\xe2\x80\x99s Chad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether was silent a little. \xe2\x80\x9cAh but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care for her\xe2\x80\x94not, I\r\nmean, it appears, after all, in the sense I\xe2\x80\x99m speaking of. He\xe2\x80\x99s _not_\r\nin love with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94but he\xe2\x80\x99s her best friend; after her mother. He\xe2\x80\x99s very fond of her.\r\nHe has his ideas about what can be done for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s very strange!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether presently remarked with a sighing\r\nsense of fulness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery strange indeed. That\xe2\x80\x99s just the beauty of it. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it very much\r\nthe kind of beauty you had in mind,\xe2\x80\x9d little Bilham went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you\r\nwere so wonderful and so inspiring to me the other day? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nadjure me, in accents I shall never forget, to see, while I\xe2\x80\x99ve a\r\nchance, everything I can?\xe2\x80\x94and _really_ to see, for it must have been\r\nthat only you meant. Well, you did me no end of good, and I\xe2\x80\x99m doing my\r\nbest. I _do_ make it out a situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether went on after a moment. But he had the next minute\r\nan inconsequent question. \xe2\x80\x9cHow comes Chad so mixed up, anyway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah, ah!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and little Bilham fell back on his cushions.\r\n\r\nIt reminded our friend of Miss Barrace, and he felt again the brush of\r\nhis sense of moving in a maze of mystic closed allusions. Yet he kept\r\nhold of his thread. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I understand really; only the general\r\ntransformation makes me occasionally gasp. Chad with such a voice in\r\nthe settlement of the future of a little countess\xe2\x80\x94no,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared, \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\ntakes more time! You say moreover,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we\xe2\x80\x99re inevitably,\r\npeople like you and me, out of the running. The curious fact remains\r\nthat Chad himself isn\xe2\x80\x99t. The situation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make for it, but in a\r\ndifferent one he could have her if he would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but that\xe2\x80\x99s only because he\xe2\x80\x99s rich and because there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\npossibility of his being richer. They won\xe2\x80\x99t think of anything but a\r\ngreat name or a great fortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99ll have no great fortune on _these_ lines.\r\nHe must stir his stumps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that,\xe2\x80\x9d little Bilham enquired, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat you were saying to Madame de\r\nVionnet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t say much to her. Of course, however,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether continued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9che can make sacrifices if he likes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham had a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cOh he\xe2\x80\x99s not keen for sacrifices; or thinks,\r\nthat is, possibly, that he has made enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it _is_ virtuous,\xe2\x80\x9d his companion observed with some decision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man dropped after a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt kept Strether himself silent a little. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve made it out for\r\nmyself,\xe2\x80\x9d he then went on; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve really, within the last half-hour, got\r\nhold of it. I understand it in short at last; which at first\xe2\x80\x94when you\r\noriginally spoke to me\xe2\x80\x94I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Nor when Chad originally spoke to me\r\neither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said little Bilham, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think that at that time you believed\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I did; and I believed Chad too. It would have been odious and\r\nunmannerly\xe2\x80\x94as well as quite perverse\xe2\x80\x94if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t. What interest have\r\nyou in deceiving me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man cast about. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat interest have I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Chad _might_ have. But you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah, ah!\xe2\x80\x9d little Bilham exclaimed.\r\n\r\nIt might, on repetition, as a mystification, have irritated our friend\r\na little, but he knew, once more, as we have seen, where he was, and\r\nhis being proof against everything was only another attestation that he\r\nmeant to stay there. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, without my own impression, realise.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s a tremendously clever brilliant capable woman, and with an\r\nextraordinary charm on top of it all\xe2\x80\x94the charm we surely all of us this\r\nevening know what to think of. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t every clever brilliant capable\r\nwoman that has it. In fact it\xe2\x80\x99s rare with any woman. So there you are,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nStrether proceeded as if not for little Bilham\xe2\x80\x99s benefit alone. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nunderstand what a relation with such a woman\xe2\x80\x94what such a high fine\r\nfriendship\xe2\x80\x94may be. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be vulgar or coarse, anyway\xe2\x80\x94and that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\npoint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s the point,\xe2\x80\x9d said little Bilham. \xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be vulgar or\r\ncoarse. And, bless us and save us, it _isn\xe2\x80\x99t!_ It\xe2\x80\x99s, upon my word, the\r\nvery finest thing I ever saw in my life, and the most distinguished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether, from beside him and leaning back with him as he leaned,\r\ndropped on him a momentary look which filled a short interval and of\r\nwhich he took no notice. He only gazed before him with intent\r\nparticipation. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course what it has done for him,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether at all\r\nevents presently pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cof course what it has done for him\xe2\x80\x94that is\r\nas to _how_ it has so wonderfully worked\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t a thing I pretend to\r\nunderstand. I\xe2\x80\x99ve to take it as I find it. There he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere he is!\xe2\x80\x9d little Bilham echoed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s really and truly she. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t understand either, even with my longer and closer opportunity.\r\nBut I\xe2\x80\x99m like you,\xe2\x80\x9d he added; \xe2\x80\x9cI can admire and rejoice even when I\xe2\x80\x99m a\r\nlittle in the dark. You see I\xe2\x80\x99ve watched it for some three years, and\r\nespecially for this last. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so bad before it as I seem to have\r\nmade out that you think\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anything now!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether impatiently broke in: \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nis but what I _do_ think! I mean that originally, for her to have cared\r\nfor him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere must have been stuff in him? Oh yes, there was stuff indeed, and\r\nmuch more of it than ever showed, I dare say, at home. Still, you\r\nknow,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man in all fairness developed, \xe2\x80\x9cthere was room for\r\nher, and that\xe2\x80\x99s where she came in. She saw her chance and took it.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what strikes me as having been so fine. But of course,\xe2\x80\x9d he wound\r\nup, \xe2\x80\x9che liked her first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaturally,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that they first met somehow and somewhere\xe2\x80\x94I believe in some\r\nAmerican house\xe2\x80\x94and she, without in the least then intending it, made\r\nher impression. Then with time and opportunity he made his; and after\r\n_that_ she was as bad as he.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether vaguely took it up. \xe2\x80\x9cAs \xe2\x80\x98bad\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe began, that is, to care\xe2\x80\x94to care very much. Alone, and in her\r\nhorrid position, she found it, when once she had started, an interest.\r\nIt was, it is, an interest, and it did\xe2\x80\x94it continues to do\xe2\x80\x94a lot for\r\nherself as well. So she still cares. She cares in fact,\xe2\x80\x9d said little\r\nBilham thoughtfully \xe2\x80\x9cmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s theory that it was none of his business was somehow not\r\ndamaged by the way he took this. \xe2\x80\x9cMore, you mean, than he?\xe2\x80\x9d On which\r\nhis companion looked round at him, and now for an instant their eyes\r\nmet. \xe2\x80\x9cMore than he?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham, for as long, hung fire. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you never tell any one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWhom should I tell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy I supposed you reported regularly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo people at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Strether took him up. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell them\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man at last looked away. \xe2\x80\x9cThen she does now care more than\r\nhe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether oddly exclaimed.\r\n\r\nBut his companion immediately met it. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you after all had your\r\nimpression of it? That\xe2\x80\x99s how you\xe2\x80\x99ve got hold of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got hold of him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I say!\xe2\x80\x9d But it was all little Bilham said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s at any rate none of my business. I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether explained,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnothing else than getting hold of him is.\xe2\x80\x9d It appeared, however, to\r\nstrike him as his business to add: \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact remains nevertheless that\r\nshe has saved him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham just waited. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought that was what _you_ were to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Strether had his answer ready. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m speaking\xe2\x80\x94in connexion with\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94of his manners and morals, his character and life. I\xe2\x80\x99m speaking of\r\nhim as a person to deal with and talk with and live with\xe2\x80\x94speaking of\r\nhim as a social animal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd isn\xe2\x80\x99t it as a social animal that you also want him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly; so that it\xe2\x80\x99s as if she had saved him _for_ us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt strikes you accordingly then,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man threw out, \xe2\x80\x9cas for you\r\nall to save _her?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh for us \xe2\x80\x98all\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether could but laugh at that. It brought him\r\nback, however, to the point he had really wished to make. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\naccepted their situation\xe2\x80\x94hard as it is. They\xe2\x80\x99re not free\xe2\x80\x94at least she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot; but they take what\xe2\x80\x99s left to them. It\xe2\x80\x99s a friendship, of a\r\nbeautiful sort; and that\xe2\x80\x99s what makes them so strong. They\xe2\x80\x99re straight,\r\nthey feel; and they keep each other up. It\xe2\x80\x99s doubtless she, however,\r\nwho, as you yourself have hinted, feels it most.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham appeared to wonder what he had hinted. \xe2\x80\x9cFeels most that\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re straight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, feels that _she_ is, and the strength that comes from it. She\r\nkeeps _him_ up\xe2\x80\x94she keeps the whole thing up. When people are able to\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s fine. She\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful, wonderful, as Miss Barrace says; and he is,\r\nin his way, too; however, as a mere man, he may sometimes rebel and not\r\nfeel that he finds his account in it. She has simply given him an\r\nimmense moral lift, and what that can explain is prodigious. That\xe2\x80\x99s why\r\nI speak of it as a situation. It _is_ one, if there ever was.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nStrether, with his head back and his eyes on the ceiling, seemed to\r\nlose himself in the vision of it.\r\n\r\nHis companion attended deeply. \xe2\x80\x9cYou state it much better than I could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you see it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t concern you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham considered. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you said just now that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nconcern you either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t a bit as Madame de Vionnet\xe2\x80\x99s affair. But as we were\r\nagain saying just now, what did I come out for but to save him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94to remove him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo save him _by_ removal; to win him over to _himself_ thinking it\r\nbest he shall take up business\xe2\x80\x94thinking he must immediately do\r\ntherefore what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to that end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said little Bilham after a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cyou _have_ won him over. He\r\ndoes think it best. He has within a day or two again said to me as\r\nmuch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether asked, \xe2\x80\x9cis why you consider that he cares less\r\nthan she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCares less for her than she for him? Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons.\r\nBut other things too have given me the impression. A man, don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nthink?\xe2\x80\x9d little Bilham presently pursued, \xe2\x80\x9c_Can\xe2\x80\x99t_, in such conditions,\r\ncare so much as a woman. It takes different conditions to make him, and\r\nthen perhaps he cares more. Chad,\xe2\x80\x9d he wound up, \xe2\x80\x9chas his possible\r\nfuture before him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you speaking of his business future?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94on the contrary; of the other, the future of what you so justly\r\ncall their situation. M. de Vionnet may live for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that they can\xe2\x80\x99t marry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man waited a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cNot being able to marry is all they\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nwith any confidence to look forward to. A woman\xe2\x80\x94a particular woman\xe2\x80\x94may\r\nstand that strain. But can a man?\xe2\x80\x9d he propounded.\r\n\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s answer was as prompt as if he had already, for himself,\r\nworked it out. \xe2\x80\x9cNot without a very high ideal of conduct. But that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njust what we\xe2\x80\x99re attributing to Chad. And how, for that matter,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nmused, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes his going to America diminish the particular strain?\r\nWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it seem rather to add to it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of sight out of mind!\xe2\x80\x9d his companion laughed. Then more bravely:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t distance lessen the torment?\xe2\x80\x9d But before Strether could\r\nreply, \xe2\x80\x9cThe thing is, you see, Chad ought to marry!\xe2\x80\x9d he wound up.\r\n\r\nStrether, for a little, appeared to think of it. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you talk of\r\ntorments you don\xe2\x80\x99t diminish mine!\xe2\x80\x9d he then broke out. The next moment\r\nhe was on his feet with a question. \xe2\x80\x9cHe ought to marry whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham rose more slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, some one he _can_\xe2\x80\x94some\r\nthoroughly nice girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, as they stood together, turned again to Jeanne. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou mean _her?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend made a sudden strange face. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter being in love with her\r\nmother? No.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t it exactly your idea that he _isn\xe2\x80\x99t_ in love with her\r\nmother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend once more had a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t at any rate in love\r\nwith Jeanne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow _can_ he be with any other woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh that I admit. But being in love isn\xe2\x80\x99t, you know, here\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94little\r\nBilham spoke in friendly reminder\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthought necessary, in strictness,\r\nfor marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what torment\xe2\x80\x94to call a torment\xe2\x80\x94can there ever possibly be with a\r\nwoman like that?\xe2\x80\x9d As if from the interest of his own question Strether\r\nhad gone on without hearing. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it for her to have turned a man out so\r\nwonderfully, too, only for somebody else?\xe2\x80\x9d He appeared to make a point\r\nof this, and little Bilham looked at him now. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen it\xe2\x80\x99s for each other\r\nthat people give things up they don\xe2\x80\x99t miss them.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he threw off as\r\nwith an extravagance of which he was conscious: \xe2\x80\x9cLet them face the\r\nfuture together!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham looked at him indeed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that after all he\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that if he gives her up\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he ought to be ashamed of himself.\xe2\x80\x9d But Strether spoke with a\r\nsound that might have passed for a laugh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Volume II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook Seventh\r\n\r\n\r\n I\r\n\r\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the first time Strether had sat alone in the great dim\r\nchurch\xe2\x80\x94still less was it the first of his giving himself up, so far as\r\nconditions permitted, to its beneficent action on his nerves. He had\r\nbeen to Notre Dame with Waymarsh, he had been there with Miss Gostrey,\r\nhe had been there with Chad Newsome, and had found the place, even in\r\ncompany, such a refuge from the obsession of his problem that, with\r\nrenewed pressure from that source, he had not unnaturally recurred to a\r\nremedy meeting the case, for the moment, so indirectly, no doubt, but\r\nso relievingly. He was conscious enough that it was only for the\r\nmoment, but good moments\xe2\x80\x94if he could call them good\xe2\x80\x94still had their\r\nvalue for a man who by this time struck himself as living almost\r\ndisgracefully from hand to mouth. Having so well learnt the way, he had\r\nlately made the pilgrimage more than once by himself\xe2\x80\x94had quite stolen\r\noff, taking an unnoticed chance and making no point of speaking of the\r\nadventure when restored to his friends.\r\n\r\nHis great friend, for that matter, was still absent, as well as\r\nremarkably silent; even at the end of three weeks Miss Gostrey hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome back. She wrote to him from Mentone, admitting that he must judge\r\nher grossly inconsequent\xe2\x80\x94perhaps in fact for the time odiously\r\nfaithless; but asking for patience, for a deferred sentence, throwing\r\nherself in short on his generosity. For her too, she could assure him,\r\nlife was complicated\xe2\x80\x94more complicated than he could have guessed; she\r\nhad moreover made certain of him\xe2\x80\x94certain of not wholly missing him on\r\nher return\xe2\x80\x94before her disappearance. If furthermore she didn\xe2\x80\x99t burden\r\nhim with letters it was frankly because of her sense of the other great\r\ncommerce he had to carry on. He himself, at the end of a fortnight, had\r\nwritten twice, to show how his generosity could be trusted; but he\r\nreminded himself in each case of Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s epistolary manner at\r\nthe times when Mrs. Newsome kept off delicate ground. He sank his\r\nproblem, he talked of Waymarsh and Miss Barrace, of little Bilham and\r\nthe set over the river, with whom he had again had tea, and he was\r\neasy, for convenience, about Chad and Madame de Vionnet and Jeanne. He\r\nadmitted that he continued to see them, he was decidedly so confirmed a\r\nhaunter of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s premises and that young man\xe2\x80\x99s practical intimacy with\r\nthem was so undeniably great; but he had his reason for not attempting\r\nto render for Miss Gostrey\xe2\x80\x99s benefit the impression of these last days.\r\nThat would be to tell her too much about himself\xe2\x80\x94it being at present\r\njust from himself he was trying to escape.\r\n\r\nThis small struggle sprang not a little, in its way, from the same\r\nimpulse that had now carried him across to Notre Dame; the impulse to\r\nlet things be, to give them time to justify themselves or at least to\r\npass. He was aware of having no errand in such a place but the desire\r\nnot to be, for the hour, in certain other places; a sense of safety, of\r\nsimplification, which each time he yielded to it he amused himself by\r\nthinking of as a private concession to cowardice. The great church had\r\nno altar for his worship, no direct voice for his soul; but it was none\r\nthe less soothing even to sanctity; for he could feel while there what\r\nhe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t elsewhere, that he was a plain tired man taking the holiday\r\nhe had earned. He was tired, but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t plain\xe2\x80\x94that was the pity and\r\nthe trouble of it; he was able, however, to drop his problem at the\r\ndoor very much as if it had been the copper piece that he deposited, on\r\nthe threshold, in the receptacle of the inveterate blind beggar. He\r\ntrod the long dim nave, sat in the splendid choir, paused before the\r\ncluttered chapels of the east end, and the mighty monument laid upon\r\nhim its spell. He might have been a student under the charm of a\r\nmuseum\xe2\x80\x94which was exactly what, in a foreign town, in the afternoon of\r\nlife, he would have liked to be free to be. This form of sacrifice did\r\nat any rate for the occasion as well as another; it made him quite\r\nsufficiently understand how, within the precinct, for the real refugee,\r\nthe things of the world could fall into abeyance. That was the\r\ncowardice, probably\xe2\x80\x94to dodge them, to beg the question, not to deal\r\nwith it in the hard outer light; but his own oblivions were too brief,\r\ntoo vain, to hurt any one but himself, and he had a vague and fanciful\r\nkindness for certain persons whom he met, figures of mystery and\r\nanxiety, and whom, with observation for his pastime, he ranked as those\r\nwho were fleeing from justice. Justice was outside, in the hard light,\r\nand injustice too; but one was as absent as the other from the air of\r\nthe long aisles and the brightness of the many altars.\r\n\r\nThus it was at all events that, one morning some dozen days after the\r\ndinner in the Boulevard Malesherbes at which Madame de Vionnet had been\r\npresent with her daughter, he was called upon to play his part in an\r\nencounter that deeply stirred his imagination. He had the habit, in\r\nthese contemplations, of watching a fellow visitant, here and there,\r\nfrom a respectable distance, remarking some note of behaviour, of\r\npenitence, of prostration, of the absolved, relieved state; this was\r\nthe manner in which his vague tenderness took its course, the degree of\r\ndemonstration to which it naturally had to confine itself. It hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nindeed so felt its responsibility as when on this occasion he suddenly\r\nmeasured the suggestive effect of a lady whose supreme stillness, in\r\nthe shade of one of the chapels, he had two or three times noticed as\r\nhe made, and made once more, his slow circuit. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t prostrate\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nin any degree bowed, but she was strangely fixed, and her prolonged\r\nimmobility showed her, while he passed and paused, as wholly given up\r\nto the need, whatever it was, that had brought her there. She only sat\r\nand gazed before her, as he himself often sat; but she had placed\r\nherself, as he never did, within the focus of the shrine, and she had\r\nlost herself, he could easily see, as he would only have liked to do.\r\nShe was not a wandering alien, keeping back more than she gave, but one\r\nof the familiar, the intimate, the fortunate, for whom these dealings\r\nhad a method and a meaning. She reminded our friend\xe2\x80\x94since it was the\r\nway of nine tenths of his current impressions to act as recalls of\r\nthings imagined\xe2\x80\x94of some fine firm concentrated heroine of an old story,\r\nsomething he had heard, read, something that, had he had a hand for\r\ndrama, he might himself have written, renewing her courage, renewing\r\nher clearness, in splendidly-protected meditation. Her back, as she\r\nsat, was turned to him, but his impression absolutely required that she\r\nshould be young and interesting, and she carried her head moreover,\r\neven in the sacred shade, with a discernible faith in herself, a kind\r\nof implied conviction of consistency, security, impunity. But what had\r\nsuch a woman come for if she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come to pray? Strether\xe2\x80\x99s reading of\r\nsuch matters was, it must be owned, confused; but he wondered if her\r\nattitude were some congruous fruit of absolution, of \xe2\x80\x9cindulgence.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nknew but dimly what indulgence, in such a place, might mean; yet he\r\nhad, as with a soft sweep, a vision of how it might indeed add to the\r\nzest of active rites. All this was a good deal to have been denoted by\r\na mere lurking figure who was nothing to him; but, the last thing\r\nbefore leaving the church, he had the surprise of a still deeper\r\nquickening.\r\n\r\nHe had dropped upon a seat halfway down the nave and, again in the\r\nmuseum mood, was trying with head thrown back and eyes aloft, to\r\nreconstitute a past, to reduce it in fact to the convenient terms of\r\nVictor Hugo, whom, a few days before, giving the rein for once in a way\r\nto the joy of life, he had purchased in seventy bound volumes, a\r\nmiracle of cheapness, parted with, he was assured by the shopman, at\r\nthe price of the red-and-gold alone. He looked, doubtless, while he\r\nplayed his eternal nippers over Gothic glooms, sufficiently rapt in\r\nreverence; but what his thought had finally bumped against was the\r\nquestion of where, among packed accumulations, so multiform a wedge\r\nwould be able to enter. Were seventy volumes in red-and-gold to be\r\nperhaps what he should most substantially have to show at Woollett as\r\nthe fruit of his mission? It was a possibility that held him a\r\nminute\xe2\x80\x94held him till he happened to feel that some one, unnoticed, had\r\napproached him and paused. Turning, he saw that a lady stood there as\r\nfor a greeting, and he sprang up as he next took her, securely, for\r\nMadame de Vionnet, who appeared to have recognised him as she passed\r\nnear him on her way to the door. She checked, quickly and gaily, a\r\ncertain confusion in him, came to meet it, turned it back, by an art of\r\nher own; the confusion having threatened him as he knew her for the\r\nperson he had lately been observing. She was the lurking figure of the\r\ndim chapel; she had occupied him more than she guessed; but it came to\r\nhim in time, luckily, that he needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell her and that no harm, after\r\nall, had been done. She herself, for that matter, straightway showing\r\nshe felt their encounter as the happiest of accidents, had for him a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou come here too?\xe2\x80\x9d that despoiled surprise of every awkwardness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come often,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI love this place, but I\xe2\x80\x99m terrible, in\r\ngeneral, for churches. The old women who live in them all know me; in\r\nfact I\xe2\x80\x99m already myself one of the old women. It\xe2\x80\x99s like that, at all\r\nevents, that I foresee I shall end.\xe2\x80\x9d Looking about for a chair, so that\r\nhe instantly pulled one nearer, she sat down with him again to the\r\nsound of an \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I like so much your also being fond\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe confessed the extent of his feeling, though she left the object\r\nvague; and he was struck with the tact, the taste of her vagueness,\r\nwhich simply took for granted in him a sense of beautiful things. He\r\nwas conscious of how much it was affected, this sense, by something\r\nsubdued and discreet in the way she had arranged herself for her\r\nspecial object and her morning walk\xe2\x80\x94he believed her to have come on\r\nfoot; the way her slightly thicker veil was drawn\xe2\x80\x94a mere touch, but\r\neverything; the composed gravity of her dress, in which, here and\r\nthere, a dull wine-colour seemed to gleam faintly through black; the\r\ncharming discretion of her small compact head; the quiet note, as she\r\nsat, of her folded, grey-gloved hands. It was, to Strether\xe2\x80\x99s mind, as\r\nif she sat on her own ground, the light honours of which, at an open\r\ngate, she thus easily did him, while all the vastness and mystery of\r\nthe domain stretched off behind. When people were so completely in\r\npossession they could be extraordinarily civil; and our friend had\r\nindeed at this hour a kind of revelation of her heritage. She was\r\nromantic for him far beyond what she could have guessed, and again he\r\nfound his small comfort in the conviction that, subtle though she was,\r\nhis impression must remain a secret from her. The thing that, once\r\nmore, made him uneasy for secrets in general was this particular\r\npatience she could have with his own want of colour; albeit that on the\r\nother hand his uneasiness pretty well dropped after he had been for ten\r\nminutes as colourless as possible and at the same time as responsive.\r\n\r\nThe moments had already, for that matter, drawn their deepest tinge\r\nfrom the special interest excited in him by his vision of his\r\ncompanion\xe2\x80\x99s identity with the person whose attitude before the\r\nglimmering altar had so impressed him. This attitude fitted admirably\r\ninto the stand he had privately taken about her connexion with Chad on\r\nthe last occasion of his seeing them together. It helped him to stick\r\nfast at the point he had then reached; it was there he had resolved\r\nthat he _would_ stick, and at no moment since had it seemed as easy to\r\ndo so. Unassailably innocent was a relation that could make one of the\r\nparties to it so carry herself. If it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t innocent why did she haunt\r\nthe churches?\xe2\x80\x94into which, given the woman he could believe he made out,\r\nshe would never have come to flaunt an insolence of guilt. She haunted\r\nthem for continued help, for strength, for peace\xe2\x80\x94sublime support which,\r\nif one were able to look at it so, she found from day to day. They\r\ntalked, in low easy tones and with lifted lingering looks, about the\r\ngreat monument and its history and its beauty\xe2\x80\x94all of which, Madame de\r\nVionnet professed, came to her most in the other, the outer view.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll presently, after we go,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwalk round it again if you\r\nlike. I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a particular hurry, and it will be pleasant to look at\r\nit well with you.\xe2\x80\x9d He had spoken of the great romancer and the great\r\nromance, and of what, to his imagination, they had done for the whole,\r\nmentioning to her moreover the exorbitance of his purchase, the seventy\r\nblazing volumes that were so out of proportion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of proportion to what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to any other plunge.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet he felt even as he spoke how at that\r\ninstant he was plunging. He had made up his mind and was impatient to\r\nget into the air; for his purpose was a purpose to be uttered outside,\r\nand he had a fear that it might with delay still slip away from him.\r\nShe however took her time; she drew out their quiet gossip as if she\r\nhad wished to profit by their meeting, and this confirmed precisely an\r\ninterpretation of her manner, of her mystery. While she rose, as he\r\nwould have called it, to the question of Victor Hugo, her voice itself,\r\nthe light low quaver of her deference to the solemnity about them,\r\nseemed to make her words mean something that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean openly.\r\nHelp, strength, peace, a sublime support\xe2\x80\x94she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t found so much of\r\nthese things as that the amount wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be sensibly greater for any\r\nscrap his appearance of faith in her might enable her to feel in her\r\nhand. Every little, in a long strain, helped, and if he happened to\r\naffect her as a firm object she could hold on by, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t jerk\r\nhimself out of her reach. People in difficulties held on by what was\r\nnearest, and he was perhaps after all not further off than sources of\r\ncomfort more abstract. It was as to this he had made up his mind; he\r\nhad made it up, that is, to give her a sign. The sign would be\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94though it was her own affair\xe2\x80\x94he understood; the sign would be\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94though it was her own affair\xe2\x80\x94she was free to clutch. Since she\r\ntook him for a firm object\xe2\x80\x94much as he might to his own sense appear at\r\ntimes to rock\xe2\x80\x94he would do his best to _be_ one.\r\n\r\nThe end of it was that half an hour later they were seated together for\r\nan early luncheon at a wonderful, a delightful house of entertainment\r\non the left bank\xe2\x80\x94a place of pilgrimage for the knowing, they were both\r\naware, the knowing who came, for its great renown, the homage of\r\nrestless days, from the other end of the town. Strether had already\r\nbeen there three times\xe2\x80\x94first with Miss Gostrey, then with Chad, then\r\nwith Chad again and with Waymarsh and little Bilham, all of whom he had\r\nhimself sagaciously entertained; and his pleasure was deep now on\r\nlearning that Madame de Vionnet hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet been initiated. When he had\r\nsaid as they strolled round the church, by the river, acting at last on\r\nwhat, within, he had made up his mind to, \xe2\x80\x9cWill you, if you have time,\r\ncome to d\xc3\xa9jeuner with me somewhere? For instance, if you know it, over\r\nthere on the other side, which is so easy a walk\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and then had named\r\nthe place; when he had done this she stopped short as for quick\r\nintensity, and yet deep difficulty, of response. She took in the\r\nproposal as if it were almost too charming to be true; and there had\r\nperhaps never yet been for her companion so unexpected a moment of\r\npride\xe2\x80\x94so fine, so odd a case, at any rate, as his finding himself thus\r\nable to offer to a person in such universal possession a new, a rare\r\namusement. She had heard of the happy spot, but she asked him in reply\r\nto a further question how in the world he could suppose her to have\r\nbeen there. He supposed himself to have supposed that Chad might have\r\ntaken her, and she guessed this the next moment to his no small\r\ndiscomfort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, let me explain,\xe2\x80\x9d she smiled, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I don\xe2\x80\x99t go about with him in\r\npublic; I never have such chances\xe2\x80\x94not having them otherwise\xe2\x80\x94and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njust the sort of thing that, as a quiet creature living in my hole, I\r\nadore.\xe2\x80\x9d It was more than kind of him to have thought of it\xe2\x80\x94though,\r\nfrankly, if he asked whether she had time she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a single minute.\r\nThat however made no difference\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99d throw everything over. Every duty\r\nat home, domestic, maternal, social, awaited her; but it was a case for\r\na high line. Her affairs would go to smash, but hadn\xe2\x80\x99t one a right to\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s snatch of scandal when one was prepared to pay? It was on this\r\npleasant basis of costly disorder, consequently, that they eventually\r\nseated themselves, on either side of a small table, at a window\r\nadjusted to the busy quay and the shining barge-burdened Seine; where,\r\nfor an hour, in the matter of letting himself go, of diving deep,\r\nStrether was to feel he had touched bottom. He was to feel many things\r\non this occasion, and one of the first of them was that he had\r\ntravelled far since that evening in London, before the theatre, when\r\nhis dinner with Maria Gostrey, between the pink-shaded candles, had\r\nstruck him as requiring so many explanations. He had at that time\r\ngathered them in, the explanations\xe2\x80\x94he had stored them up; but it was at\r\npresent as if he had either soared above or sunk below them\xe2\x80\x94he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell which; he could somehow think of none that didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to leave\r\nthe appearance of collapse and cynicism easier for him than lucidity.\r\nHow could he wish it to be lucid for others, for any one, that he, for\r\nthe hour, saw reasons enough in the mere way the bright clean ordered\r\nwater-side life came in at the open window?\xe2\x80\x94the mere way Madame de\r\nVionnet, opposite him over their intensely white table-linen, their\r\n_omelette aux tomates_, their bottle of straw-coloured Chablis, thanked\r\nhim for everything almost with the smile of a child, while her grey\r\neyes moved in and out of their talk, back to the quarter of the warm\r\nspring air, in which early summer had already begun to throb, and then\r\nback again to his face and their human questions.\r\n\r\nTheir human questions became many before they had done\xe2\x80\x94many more, as\r\none after the other came up, than our friend\xe2\x80\x99s free fancy had at all\r\nforeseen. The sense he had had before, the sense he had had repeatedly,\r\nthe sense that the situation was running away with him, had never been\r\nso sharp as now; and all the more that he could perfectly put his\r\nfinger on the moment it had taken the bit in its teeth. That accident\r\nhad definitely occurred, the other evening, after Chad\xe2\x80\x99s dinner; it had\r\noccurred, as he fully knew, at the moment when he interposed between\r\nthis lady and her child, when he suffered himself so to discuss with\r\nher a matter closely concerning them that her own subtlety, marked by\r\nits significant \xe2\x80\x9cThank you!\xe2\x80\x9d instantly sealed the occasion in her\r\nfavour. Again he had held off for ten days, but the situation had\r\ncontinued out of hand in spite of that; the fact that it was running so\r\nfast being indeed just _why_ he had held off. What had come over him as\r\nhe recognised her in the nave of the church was that holding off could\r\nbe but a losing game from the instant she was worked for not only by\r\nher subtlety, but by the hand of fate itself. If all the accidents were\r\nto fight on her side\xe2\x80\x94and by the actual showing they loomed large\xe2\x80\x94he\r\ncould only give himself up. This was what he had done in privately\r\ndeciding then and there to propose she should breakfast with him. What\r\ndid the success of his proposal in fact resemble but the smash in which\r\na regular runaway properly ends? The smash was their walk, their\r\nd\xc3\xa9jeuner, their omelette, the Chablis, the place, the view, their\r\npresent talk and his present pleasure in it\xe2\x80\x94to say nothing, wonder of\r\nwonders, of her own. To this tune and nothing less, accordingly, was\r\nhis surrender made good. It sufficiently lighted up at least the folly\r\nof holding off. Ancient proverbs sounded, for his memory, in the tone\r\nof their words and the clink of their glasses, in the hum of the town\r\nand the plash of the river. It _was_ clearly better to suffer as a\r\nsheep than as a lamb. One might as well perish by the sword as by\r\nfamine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaria\xe2\x80\x99s still away?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that was the first thing she had asked him; and\r\nwhen he had found the frankness to be cheerful about it in spite of the\r\nmeaning he knew her to attach to Miss Gostrey\xe2\x80\x99s absence, she had gone\r\non to enquire if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t tremendously miss her. There were reasons\r\nthat made him by no means sure, yet he nevertheless answered\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTremendously\xe2\x80\x9d; which she took in as if it were all she had wished to\r\nprove. Then, \xe2\x80\x9cA man in trouble _must_ be possessed somehow of a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said; \xe2\x80\x9cif she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come in one way she comes in another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you call me a man in trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh because that\xe2\x80\x99s the way you strike me.\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke ever so gently and\r\nas if with all fear of wounding him while she sat partaking of his\r\nbounty. \xe2\x80\x9c_Aren\xe2\x80\x99t_ you in trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt himself colour at the question, and then hated that\xe2\x80\x94hated to\r\npass for anything so idiotic as woundable. Woundable by Chad\xe2\x80\x99s lady, in\r\nrespect to whom he had come out with such a fund of indifference\xe2\x80\x94was he\r\nalready at that point? Perversely, none the less, his pause gave a\r\nstrange air of truth to her supposition; and what was he in fact but\r\ndisconcerted at having struck her just in the way he had most dreamed\r\nof not doing? \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not in trouble yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he at last smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not in\r\ntrouble now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m always so. But that you sufficiently know.\xe2\x80\x9d She was a woman\r\nwho, between courses, could be graceful with her elbows on the table.\r\nIt was a posture unknown to Mrs. Newsome, but it was easy for a _femme\r\ndu monde_. \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I am \xe2\x80\x98now\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a question you put to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he presently returned, \xe2\x80\x9cthe night\r\nof Chad\xe2\x80\x99s dinner. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer it then, and it has been very\r\nhandsome of you not to have sought an occasion for pressing me about it\r\nsince.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was instantly all there. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I know what you allude to. I\r\nasked you what you had meant by saying, the day you came to see me,\r\njust before you left me, that you\xe2\x80\x99d save me. And you then said\xe2\x80\x94at our\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94that you\xe2\x80\x99d have really to wait to see, for yourself, what you\r\ndid mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I asked for time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it sounds now, as you put\r\nit, like a very ridiculous speech.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured\xe2\x80\x94she was full of attenuation. But she had another\r\nthought. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it does sound ridiculous why do you deny that you\xe2\x80\x99re in\r\ntrouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh if I were,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cit wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the trouble of fearing\r\nridicule. I don\xe2\x80\x99t fear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat then do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing\xe2\x80\x94now.\xe2\x80\x9d And he leaned back in his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like your \xe2\x80\x98now\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed across at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s precisely that it fully comes to me at present that I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nkept you long enough. I know by this time, at any rate, what I meant by\r\nmy speech; and I really knew it the night of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it was difficult at the moment. I had already at that moment\r\ndone something for you, in the sense of what I had said the day I went\r\nto see you; but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t then sure of the importance I might represent\r\nthis as having.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was all eagerness. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re sure now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I see that, practically, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done for you\xe2\x80\x94had done for you when\r\nyou put me your question\xe2\x80\x94all that it\xe2\x80\x99s as yet possible to me to do. I\r\nfeel now,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it may go further than I thought. What I\r\ndid after my visit to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, \xe2\x80\x9cwas to write straight off to\r\nMrs. Newsome about you, and I\xe2\x80\x99m at last, from one day to the other,\r\nexpecting her answer. It\xe2\x80\x99s this answer that will represent, as I\r\nbelieve, the consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPatient and beautiful was her interest. \xe2\x80\x9cI see\xe2\x80\x94the consequences of your\r\nspeaking for me.\xe2\x80\x9d And she waited as if not to hustle him.\r\n\r\nHe acknowledged it by immediately going on. \xe2\x80\x9cThe question, you\r\nunderstand, was _how_ I should save you. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying it by thus\r\nletting her know that I consider you worth saving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see\xe2\x80\x94I see.\xe2\x80\x9d Her eagerness broke through.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I thank you enough?\xe2\x80\x9d He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell her that, however, and\r\nshe quickly pursued. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do really, for yourself, consider it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis only answer at first was to help her to the dish that had been\r\nfreshly put before them. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve written to her again since then\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nleft her in no doubt of what I think. I\xe2\x80\x99ve told her all about you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks\xe2\x80\x94not so much. \xe2\x80\x98All about\xe2\x80\x99 me,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll it seems to me you\xe2\x80\x99ve done for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh and you might have added all it seems to _me!_\xe2\x80\x9d She laughed again,\r\nwhile she took up her knife and fork, as in the cheer of these\r\nassurances. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99re not sure how she\xe2\x80\x99ll take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99ll not pretend I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVoil\xc3\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d And she waited a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d tell me about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether with a slightly strained smile, \xe2\x80\x9call that need\r\nconcern you about her is that she\xe2\x80\x99s really a grand person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Vionnet seemed to demur. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that all that need concern me\r\nabout her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Strether neglected the question. \xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t Chad talked to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf his mother? Yes, a great deal\xe2\x80\x94immensely. But not from your point of\r\nview.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d our friend returned, \xe2\x80\x9chave said any ill of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the least bit. He has given me, like you, the assurance that she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreally grand. But her being really grand is somehow just what hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseemed to simplify our case. Nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cis further from\r\nme than to wish to say a word against her; but of course I feel how\r\nlittle she can like being told of her owing me anything. No woman ever\r\nenjoys such an obligation to another woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a proposition Strether couldn\xe2\x80\x99t contradict. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet what\r\nother way could I have expressed to her what I felt? It\xe2\x80\x99s what there\r\nwas most to say about you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean then that she _will_ be good to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m waiting to see. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve little doubt she would,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cif she could comfortably see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed to strike her as a happy, a beneficent thought. \xe2\x80\x9cOh then\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that be managed? Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she come out? Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she if you so\r\nput it to her? _Did_ you by any possibility?\xe2\x80\x9d she faintly quavered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he was prompt. \xe2\x80\x9cNot that. It would be, much more, to give an\r\naccount of you that\xe2\x80\x94since there\xe2\x80\x99s no question of _your_ paying the\r\nvisit\xe2\x80\x94I should go home first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt instantly made her graver. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you thinking of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh all the while, naturally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay with us\xe2\x80\x94stay with us!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed on this. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s your only\r\nway to make sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo make sure of what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t break up. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t come out to do that to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t it depend,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether returned after a moment, \xe2\x80\x9con what you\r\nmean by breaking up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you know well enough what I mean!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis silence seemed again for a little to denote an understanding. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ntake for granted remarkable things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do\xe2\x80\x94to the extent that I don\xe2\x80\x99t take for granted vulgar ones.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re perfectly capable of seeing that what you came out for wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nreally at all to do what you\xe2\x80\x99d now have to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly simple,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether good-humouredly pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had\r\nbut one thing to do\xe2\x80\x94to put our case before him. To put it as it could\r\nonly be put here on the spot\xe2\x80\x94by personal pressure. My dear lady,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nlucidly pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cmy work, you see, is really done, and my reasons for\r\nstaying on even another day are none of the best. Chad\xe2\x80\x99s in possession\r\nof our case and professes to do it full justice. What remains is with\r\nhimself. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had my rest, my amusement and refreshment; I\xe2\x80\x99ve had, as\r\nwe say at Woollett, a lovely time. Nothing in it has been more lovely\r\nthan this happy meeting with you\xe2\x80\x94in these fantastic conditions to which\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve so delightfully consented. I\xe2\x80\x99ve a sense of success. It\xe2\x80\x99s what I\r\nwanted. My getting all this good is what Chad has waited for, and I\r\ngather that if I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to go he\xe2\x80\x99s the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head with a finer deeper wisdom. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not ready. If\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re ready why did you write to Mrs. Newsome in the sense you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nmentioned to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether considered. \xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t go before I hear from her. You\xe2\x80\x99re too\r\nmuch afraid of her,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\nIt produced between them a long look from which neither shrank. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think you believe that\xe2\x80\x94believe I\xe2\x80\x99ve not really reason to fear\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s capable of great generosity,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether presently stated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then let her trust me a little. That\xe2\x80\x99s all I ask. Let her\r\nrecognise in spite of everything what I\xe2\x80\x99ve done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh remember,\xe2\x80\x9d our friend replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she can\xe2\x80\x99t effectually\r\nrecognise it without seeing it for herself. Let Chad go over and show\r\nher what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done, and let him plead with her there for it and, as\r\nit were, for _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe measured the depth of this suggestion. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you give me your word of\r\nhonour that if she once has him there she won\xe2\x80\x99t do her best to marry\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt made her companion, this enquiry, look again a while out at the\r\nview; after which he spoke without sharpness. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen she sees for\r\nherself what he is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she had already broken in. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s when she sees for herself what he\r\nis that she\xe2\x80\x99ll want to marry him most.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s attitude, that of due deference to what she said, permitted\r\nhim to attend for a minute to his luncheon. \xe2\x80\x9cI doubt if that will come\r\noff. It won\xe2\x80\x99t be easy to make it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be easy if he remains there\xe2\x80\x94and he\xe2\x80\x99ll remain for the money.\r\nThe money appears to be, as a probability, so hideously much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether presently concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing _could_ really hurt you\r\nbut his marrying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave a strange light laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cPutting aside what may really hurt\r\n_him_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut her friend looked at her as if he had thought of that too. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nquestion will come up, of course, of the future that you yourself offer\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was leaning back now, but she fully faced him. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, let it come\r\nup!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe point is that it\xe2\x80\x99s for Chad to make of it what he can. His being\r\nproof against marriage will show what he does make.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he _is_ proof, yes\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she accepted the proposition. \xe2\x80\x9cBut for myself,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe added, \xe2\x80\x9cthe question is what _you_ make.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh I make nothing. It\xe2\x80\x99s not my affair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon. It\xe2\x80\x99s just there that, since you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken it up and\r\nare committed to it, it most intensely becomes yours. You\xe2\x80\x99re not saving\r\nme, I take it, for your interest in myself, but for your interest in\r\nour friend. The one\xe2\x80\x99s at any rate wholly dependent on the other. You\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t in honour not see me through,\xe2\x80\x9d she wound up, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause you can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nin honour not see _him_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrange and beautiful to him was her quiet soft acuteness. The thing\r\nthat most moved him was really that she was so deeply serious. She had\r\nnone of the portentous forms of it, but he had never come in contact,\r\nit struck him, with a force brought to so fine a head. Mrs. Newsome,\r\ngoodness knew, was serious; but it was nothing to this. He took it all\r\nin, he saw it all together. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he mused, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t in honour not see\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer face affected him as with an exquisite light. \xe2\x80\x9cYou _will_ then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this she pushed back her chair and was the next moment on her feet.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you!\xe2\x80\x9d she said with her hand held out to him across the table\r\nand with no less a meaning in the words than her lips had so\r\nparticularly given them after Chad\xe2\x80\x99s dinner. The golden nail she had\r\nthen driven in pierced a good inch deeper. Yet he reflected that he\r\nhimself had only meanwhile done what he had made up his mind to on the\r\nsame occasion. So far as the essence of the matter went he had simply\r\nstood fast on the spot on which he had then planted his feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n II\r\n\r\nHe received three days after this a communication from America, in the\r\nform of a scrap of blue paper folded and gummed, not reaching him\r\nthrough his bankers, but delivered at his hotel by a small boy in\r\nuniform, who, under instructions from the concierge, approached him as\r\nhe slowly paced the little court. It was the evening hour, but daylight\r\nwas long now and Paris more than ever penetrating. The scent of flowers\r\nwas in the streets, he had the whiff of violets perpetually in his\r\nnose; and he had attached himself to sounds and suggestions, vibrations\r\nof the air, human and dramatic, he imagined, as they were not in other\r\nplaces, that came out for him more and more as the mild afternoons\r\ndeepened\xe2\x80\x94a far-off hum, a sharp near click on the asphalt, a voice\r\ncalling, replying, somewhere and as full of tone as an actor\xe2\x80\x99s in a\r\nplay. He was to dine at home, as usual, with Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x94they had settled\r\nto that for thrift and simplicity; and he now hung about before his\r\nfriend came down.\r\n\r\nHe read his telegram in the court, standing still a long time where he\r\nhad opened it and giving five minutes afterwards to the renewed study\r\nof it. At last, quickly, he crumpled it up as if to get it out of the\r\nway; in spite of which, however, he kept it there\xe2\x80\x94still kept it when,\r\nat the end of another turn, he had dropped into a chair placed near a\r\nsmall table. Here, with his scrap of paper compressed in his fist and\r\nfurther concealed by his folding his arms tight, he sat for some time\r\nin thought, gazed before him so straight that Waymarsh appeared and\r\napproached him without catching his eye. The latter in fact, struck\r\nwith his appearance, looked at him hard for a single instant and then,\r\nas if determined to that course by some special vividness in it,\r\ndropped back into the _salon de lecture_ without addressing him. But\r\nthe pilgrim from Milrose permitted himself still to observe the scene\r\nfrom behind the clear glass plate of that retreat. Strether ended, as\r\nhe sat, by a fresh scrutiny of his compressed missive, which he\r\nsmoothed out carefully again as he placed it on his table. There it\r\nremained for some minutes, until, at last looking up, he saw Waymarsh\r\nwatching him from within. It was on this that their eyes met\xe2\x80\x94met for a\r\nmoment during which neither moved. But Strether then got up, folding\r\nhis telegram more carefully and putting it into his waistcoat pocket.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the friends were seated together at dinner; but\r\nStrether had meanwhile said nothing about it, and they eventually\r\nparted, after coffee in the court, with nothing said on either side.\r\nOur friend had moreover the consciousness that even less than usual was\r\non this occasion said between them, so that it was almost as if each\r\nhad been waiting for something from the other. Waymarsh had always more\r\nor less the air of sitting at the door of his tent, and silence, after\r\nso many weeks, had come to play its part in their concert. This note\r\nindeed, to Strether\xe2\x80\x99s sense, had lately taken a fuller tone, and it was\r\nhis fancy to-night that they had never quite so drawn it out. Yet it\r\nbefell, none the less that he closed the door to confidence when his\r\ncompanion finally asked him if there were anything particular the\r\nmatter with him. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cmore than usual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, however, at an early hour, he found occasion to give an\r\nanswer more in consonance with the facts. What was the matter had\r\ncontinued to be so all the previous evening, the first hours of which,\r\nafter dinner, in his room, he had devoted to the copious composition of\r\na letter. He had quitted Waymarsh for this purpose, leaving him to his\r\nown resources with less ceremony than their wont, but finally coming\r\ndown again with his letter unconcluded and going forth into the streets\r\nwithout enquiry for his comrade. He had taken a long vague walk, and\r\none o\xe2\x80\x99clock had struck before his return and his re-ascent to his room\r\nby the aid of the glimmering candle-end left for him on the shelf\r\noutside the porter\xe2\x80\x99s lodge. He had possessed himself, on closing his\r\ndoor, of the numerous loose sheets of his unfinished composition, and\r\nthen, without reading them over, had torn them into small pieces. He\r\nhad thereupon slept\xe2\x80\x94as if it had been in some measure thanks to that\r\nsacrifice\xe2\x80\x94the sleep of the just, and had prolonged his rest\r\nconsiderably beyond his custom. Thus it was that when, between nine and\r\nten, the tap of the knob of a walking-stick sounded on his door, he had\r\nnot yet made himself altogether presentable. Chad Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s bright deep\r\nvoice determined quickly enough none the less the admission of the\r\nvisitor. The little blue paper of the evening before, plainly an object\r\nthe more precious for its escape from premature destruction, now lay on\r\nthe sill of the open window, smoothed out afresh and kept from blowing\r\naway by the superincumbent weight of his watch. Chad, looking about\r\nwith careless and competent criticism, as he looked wherever he went\r\nimmediately espied it and permitted himself to fix it for a moment\r\nrather hard. After which he turned his eyes to his host. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has come\r\nthen at last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether paused in the act of pinning his necktie. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you know\xe2\x80\x94?\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve had one too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had nothing, and I only know what I see. I see that thing and\r\nI guess. Well,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cit comes as pat as in a play, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nprecisely turned up this morning\xe2\x80\x94as I would have done yesterday, but it\r\nwas impossible\xe2\x80\x94to take you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo take me?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether had turned again to his glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBack, at last, as I promised. I\xe2\x80\x99m ready\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve really been ready this\r\nmonth. I\xe2\x80\x99ve only been waiting for you\xe2\x80\x94as was perfectly right. But\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re better now; you\xe2\x80\x99re safe\xe2\x80\x94I see that for myself; you\xe2\x80\x99ve got all\r\nyour good. You\xe2\x80\x99re looking, this morning, as fit as a flea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether, at his glass, finished dressing; consulting that witness\r\nmoreover on this last opinion. _Was_ he looking preternaturally fit?\r\nThere was something in it perhaps for Chad\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful eye, but he had\r\nfelt himself for hours rather in pieces. Such a judgement, however, was\r\nafter all but a contribution to his resolve; it testified unwittingly\r\nto his wisdom. He was still firmer, apparently\xe2\x80\x94since it shone in him as\r\na light\xe2\x80\x94than he had flattered himself. His firmness indeed was slightly\r\ncompromised, as he faced about to his friend, by the way this very\r\npersonage looked\xe2\x80\x94though the case would of course have been worse hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthe secret of personal magnificence been at every hour Chad\xe2\x80\x99s unfailing\r\npossession. There he was in all the pleasant morning freshness of\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94strong and sleek and gay, easy and fragrant and fathomless, with\r\nhappy health in his colour, and pleasant silver in his thick young\r\nhair, and the right word for everything on the lips that his clear\r\nbrownness caused to show as red. He had never struck Strether as\r\npersonally such a success; it was as if now, for his definite\r\nsurrender, he had gathered himself vividly together. This, sharply and\r\nrather strangely, was the form in which he was to be presented to\r\nWoollett. Our friend took him in again\xe2\x80\x94he was always taking him in and\r\nyet finding that parts of him still remained out; though even thus his\r\nimage showed through a mist of other things. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had a cable,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nStrether said, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom your mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say, my dear man. I hope she\xe2\x80\x99s well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s not well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to have to tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chad, \xe2\x80\x9cI must have had the instinct of it. All the more\r\nreason then that we should start straight off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether had now got together hat, gloves and stick, but Chad had\r\ndropped on the sofa as if to show where he wished to make his point. He\r\nkept observing his companion\xe2\x80\x99s things; he might have been judging how\r\nquickly they could be packed. He might even have wished to hint that\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d send his own servant to assist. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether\r\nenquired, \xe2\x80\x9cby \xe2\x80\x98straight off\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh by one of next week\xe2\x80\x99s boats. Everything at this season goes out so\r\nlight that berths will be easy anywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether had in his hand his telegram, which he had kept there after\r\nattaching his watch, and he now offered it to Chad, who, however, with\r\nan odd movement, declined to take it. \xe2\x80\x9cThanks, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather not. Your\r\ncorrespondence with Mother\xe2\x80\x99s your own affair. I\xe2\x80\x99m only _with_ you both\r\non it, whatever it is.\xe2\x80\x9d Strether, at this, while their eyes met, slowly\r\nfolded the missive and put it in his pocket; after which, before he had\r\nspoken again, Chad broke fresh ground. \xe2\x80\x9cHas Miss Gostrey come back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut when Strether presently spoke it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in answer. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not, I\r\ngather, that your mother\xe2\x80\x99s physically ill; her health, on the whole,\r\nthis spring, seems to have been better than usual. But she\xe2\x80\x99s worried,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s anxious, and it appears to have risen within the last few days to\r\na climax. We\xe2\x80\x99ve tired out, between us, her patience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh it isn\xe2\x80\x99t _you!_\xe2\x80\x9d Chad generously protested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon\xe2\x80\x94it _is_ me.\xe2\x80\x9d Strether was mild and melancholy, but\r\nfirm. He saw it far away and over his companion\xe2\x80\x99s head. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\nparticularly me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then all the more reason. _Marchons, marchons!_\xe2\x80\x9d said the young\r\nman gaily. His host, however, at this, but continued to stand agaze;\r\nand he had the next thing repeated his question of a moment before.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas Miss Gostrey come back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, two days ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m to see her to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d But Strether wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t linger now on Miss\r\nGostrey. \xe2\x80\x9cYour mother sends me an ultimatum. If I can\xe2\x80\x99t bring you I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nto leave you; I\xe2\x80\x99m to come at any rate myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but you _can_ bring me now,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad, from his sofa, reassuringly\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\nStrether had a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I understand you. Why was it that,\r\nmore than a month ago, you put it to me so urgently to let Madame de\r\nVionnet speak for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Why\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d Chad considered, but he had it at his fingers\xe2\x80\x99 ends. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy but\r\nbecause I knew how well she\xe2\x80\x99d do it? It was the way to keep you quiet\r\nand, to that extent, do you good. Besides,\xe2\x80\x9d he happily and comfortably\r\nexplained, \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted you really to know her and to get the impression\r\nof her\xe2\x80\x94and you see the good that _has_ done you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cthe way she has spoken for you, all the same\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nfar as I\xe2\x80\x99ve given her a chance\xe2\x80\x94has only made me feel how much she\r\nwishes to keep you. If you make nothing of that I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you\r\nwanted me to listen to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy my dear man,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cI make everything of it! How can\r\nyou doubt\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doubt only because you come to me this morning with your signal to\r\nstart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad stared, then gave a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd isn\xe2\x80\x99t my signal to start just what\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether debated; he took another turn. \xe2\x80\x9cThis last month I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nawaiting, I think, more than anything else, the message I have here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean you\xe2\x80\x99ve been afraid of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I was doing my business in my own way. And I suppose your\r\npresent announcement,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether went on, \xe2\x80\x9cisn\xe2\x80\x99t merely the result of\r\nyour sense of what I\xe2\x80\x99ve expected. Otherwise you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have put me in\r\nrelation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d But he paused, pulling up.\r\n\r\nAt this Chad rose. \xe2\x80\x9cAh _her_ wanting me not to go has nothing to do\r\nwith it! It\xe2\x80\x99s only because she\xe2\x80\x99s afraid\xe2\x80\x94afraid of the way that, over\r\nthere, I may get caught. But her fear\xe2\x80\x99s groundless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had met again his companion\xe2\x80\x99s sufficiently searching look. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you\r\ntired of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad gave him in reply to this, with a movement of the head, the\r\nstrangest slow smile he had ever had from him. \xe2\x80\x9cNever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt had immediately, on Strether\xe2\x80\x99s imagination, so deep and soft an\r\neffect that our friend could only for the moment keep it before him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad obligingly and serenely repeated.\r\n\r\nIt made his companion take several more steps. \xe2\x80\x9cThen _you\xe2\x80\x99re_ not\r\nafraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfraid to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether pulled up again. \xe2\x80\x9cAfraid to stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man looked brightly amazed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want me now to \xe2\x80\x98stay\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I don\xe2\x80\x99t immediately sail the Pococks will immediately come out.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cby your mother\xe2\x80\x99s ultimatum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad showed a still livelier, but not an alarmed interest. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has\r\nturned on Sarah and Jim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether joined him for an instant in the vision. \xe2\x80\x9cOh and you may be\r\nsure Mamie. _That\xe2\x80\x99s_ whom she\xe2\x80\x99s turning on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis also Chad saw\xe2\x80\x94he laughed out. \xe2\x80\x9cMamie\xe2\x80\x94to corrupt me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s very charming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99ve already more than once told me. I should like to see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething happy and easy, something above all unconscious, in the way\r\nhe said this, brought home again to his companion the facility of his\r\nattitude and the enviability of his state. \xe2\x80\x9cSee her then by all means.\r\nAnd consider too,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you really give your sister\r\na lift in letting her come to you. You give her a couple of months of\r\nParis, which she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t seen, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken, since just after she\r\nwas married, and which I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she wants but the pretext to visit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad listened, but with all his own knowledge of the world. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has\r\nhad it, the pretext, these several years, yet she has never taken it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean _you?_\xe2\x80\x9d Strether after an instant enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly\xe2\x80\x94the lone exile. And whom do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said Chad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I mean _me_. I\xe2\x80\x99m her pretext. That is\xe2\x80\x94for it comes to the same\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m your mother\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad asked, \xe2\x80\x9cdoesn\xe2\x80\x99t Mother come herself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend gave him a long look. \xe2\x80\x9cShould you like her to?\xe2\x80\x9d And as he\r\nfor the moment said nothing: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly open to you to cable for\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad continued to think. \xe2\x80\x9cWill she come if I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite possibly. But try, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t _you_ try?\xe2\x80\x9d Chad after a moment asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad thought. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t desire her presence here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether faced the question, and his answer was the more emphatic.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t put it off, my dear boy, on _me!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94I see what you mean. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99d behave beautifully but you\r\n_don\xe2\x80\x99t_ want to see her. So I won\xe2\x80\x99t play you that trick.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether declared, \xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call it a trick. You\xe2\x80\x99ve a perfect\r\nright, and it would be perfectly straight of you.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he added in a\r\ndifferent tone: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d have moreover, in the person of Madame de\r\nVionnet, a very interesting relation prepared for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir eyes, on this proposition, continued to meet, but Chad\xe2\x80\x99s pleasant\r\nand bold, never flinched for a moment. He got up at last and he said\r\nsomething with which Strether was struck. \xe2\x80\x9cShe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand her,\r\nbut that makes no difference. Madame de Vionnet would like to see her.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99d like to be charming to her. She believes she could work it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether thought a moment, affected by this, but finally turning away.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re quite sure?\xe2\x80\x9d Chad asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, risk it if you like!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether, who uttered this with serenity, had urged a plea for their\r\nnow getting into the air; but the young man still waited. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you\r\nsent your answer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done nothing yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you waiting to see me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly waiting\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and Chad, with this, had a smile for him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto see Miss\r\nGostrey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94not even Miss Gostrey. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t waiting to see any one. I had only\r\nwaited, till now, to make up my mind\xe2\x80\x94in complete solitude; and, since I\r\nof course absolutely owe you the information, was on the point of going\r\nout with it quite made up. Have therefore a little more patience with\r\nme. Remember,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat that\xe2\x80\x99s what you originally asked\r\n_me_ to have. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had it, you see, and you see what has come of it.\r\nStay on with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad looked grave. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much longer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, till I make you a sign. I can\xe2\x80\x99t myself, you know, at the best,\r\nor at the worst, stay for ever. Let the Pococks come,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it gains you time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94it gains me time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad, as if it still puzzled him, waited a minute. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nget back to Mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot just yet. I\xe2\x80\x99m not ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou feel,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad asked in a tone of his own, \xe2\x80\x9cthe charm of life over\r\nhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImmensely.\xe2\x80\x9d Strether faced it. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve helped me so to feel it that\r\nthat surely needn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me, and I\xe2\x80\x99m delighted. But what, my dear man,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nChad went on with conscious queerness, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes it all lead to for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe change of position and of relation, for each, was so oddly betrayed\r\nin the question that Chad laughed out as soon as he had uttered\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94which made Strether also laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, to my having a certitude that\r\nhas been tested\xe2\x80\x94that has passed through the fire. But oh,\xe2\x80\x9d he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp breaking out, \xe2\x80\x9cif within my first month here you had been willing\r\nto move with me\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Chad, while he broke down as for weight of thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we should have been over there by now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had your fun!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have had a month of it; and I\xe2\x80\x99m having now, if you want to\r\nknow,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether continued, \xe2\x80\x9cenough to last me for the rest of my days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad looked amused and interested, yet still somewhat in the dark;\r\npartly perhaps because Strether\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of fun had required of him\r\nfrom the first a good deal of elucidation. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do if I left\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeft me?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Strether remained blank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly for a month or two\xe2\x80\x94time to go and come. Madame de Vionnet,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad\r\nsmiled, \xe2\x80\x9cwould look after you in the interval.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo go back by yourself, I remaining here?\xe2\x80\x9d Again for an instant their\r\neyes had the question out; after which Strether said: \xe2\x80\x9cGrotesque!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I want to see Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad presently returned. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember how long\r\nit is since I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong indeed; and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly why I was originally so keen for\r\nmoving you. Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t you shown us enough how beautifully you could do\r\nwithout it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh but,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chad wonderfully, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m better now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was an easy triumph in it that made his friend laugh out again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh if you were worse I _should_ know what to do with you. In that case\r\nI believe I\xe2\x80\x99d have you gagged and strapped down, carried on board\r\nresisting, kicking. How _much_,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether asked, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you want to see\r\nMother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Chad seemed to find it in fact difficult to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy as much as you\xe2\x80\x99ve made me. I\xe2\x80\x99d give anything to see her. And\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve left me,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad went on, \xe2\x80\x9cin little enough doubt as to how much\r\n_she_ wants it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether thought a minute. \xe2\x80\x9cWell then if those things are really your\r\nmotive catch the French steamer and sail to-morrow. Of course, when it\r\ncomes to that, you\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely free to do as you choose. From the\r\nmoment you can\xe2\x80\x99t hold yourself I can only accept your flight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll fly in a minute then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chad, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99ll stay here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stay here till the next steamer\xe2\x80\x94then I\xe2\x80\x99ll follow you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you call that,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad asked, \xe2\x80\x9caccepting my flight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing to call it. The only way to keep me\r\nhere, accordingly,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether explained, \xe2\x80\x9cis by staying yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad took it in. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the more that I\xe2\x80\x99ve really dished you, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDished me?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether echoed as inexpressively as possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy if she sends out the Pococks it will be that she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t trust\r\nyou, and if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t trust you, that bears upon\xe2\x80\x94well, you know\r\nwhat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether decided after a moment that he did know what, and in\r\nconsonance with this he spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see then all the more what you owe\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if I do see, how can I pay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy not deserting me. By standing by me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I say\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d But Chad, as they went downstairs, clapped a firm hand, in\r\nthe manner of a pledge, upon his shoulder. They descended slowly\r\ntogether and had, in the court of the hotel, some further talk, of\r\nwhich the upshot was that they presently separated. Chad Newsome\r\ndeparted, and Strether, left alone, looked about, superficially, for\r\nWaymarsh. But Waymarsh hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet, it appeared, come down, and our\r\nfriend finally went forth without sight of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n III\r\n\r\nAt four o\xe2\x80\x99clock that afternoon he had still not seen him, but he was\r\nthen, as to make up for this, engaged in talk about him with Miss\r\nGostrey. Strether had kept away from home all day, given himself up to\r\nthe town and to his thoughts, wandered and mused, been at once restless\r\nand absorbed\xe2\x80\x94and all with the present climax of a rich little welcome\r\nin the Quartier Marb\xc5\x93uf. \xe2\x80\x9cWaymarsh has been, \xe2\x80\x98unbeknown\xe2\x80\x99 to me, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nconvinced\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for Miss Gostrey had enquired\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cin communication with\r\nWoollett: the consequence of which was, last night, the loudest\r\npossible call for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean a letter to bring you home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94a cable, which I have at this moment in my pocket: a \xe2\x80\x98Come back by\r\nthe first ship.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s hostess, it might have been made out, just escaped changing\r\ncolour. Reflexion arrived but in time and established a provisional\r\nserenity. It was perhaps exactly this that enabled her to say with\r\nduplicity: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re going\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou almost deserve it when you abandon me so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head as if this were not worth taking up. \xe2\x80\x9cMy absence has\r\nhelped you\xe2\x80\x94as I\xe2\x80\x99ve only to look at you to see. It was my calculation,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99m justified. You\xe2\x80\x99re not where you were. And the thing,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsmiled, \xe2\x80\x9cwas for me not to be there either. You can go of yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh but I feel to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d he comfortably declared, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I shall want you\r\nyet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took him all in again. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I promise you not again to leave you,\r\nbut it will only be to follow you. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got your momentum and can\r\ntoddle alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe intelligently accepted it. \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I suppose I can toddle. It\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nsight of that in fact that has upset Waymarsh. He can bear it\xe2\x80\x94the way I\r\nstrike him as going\xe2\x80\x94no longer. That\xe2\x80\x99s only the climax of his original\r\nfeeling. He wants me to quit; and he must have written to Woollett that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m in peril of perdition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh good!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cBut is it only your supposition?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI make it out\xe2\x80\x94it explains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he denies?\xe2\x80\x94or you haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve not had time,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether said; \xe2\x80\x9cI made it out but last night,\r\nputting various things together, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve not been since then face to\r\nface with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause you\xe2\x80\x99re too disgusted? You can\xe2\x80\x99t trust yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe settled his glasses on his nose. \xe2\x80\x9cDo I look in a great rage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look divine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cto be angry about. He has done me on\r\nthe contrary a service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made it out. \xe2\x80\x9cBy bringing things to a head?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow well you understand!\xe2\x80\x9d he almost groaned. \xe2\x80\x9cWaymarsh won\xe2\x80\x99t in the\r\nleast, at any rate, when I have it out with him, deny or extenuate. He\r\nhas acted from the deepest conviction, with the best conscience and\r\nafter wakeful nights. He\xe2\x80\x99ll recognise that he\xe2\x80\x99s fully responsible, and\r\nwill consider that he has been highly successful; so that any\r\ndiscussion we may have will bring us quite together again\xe2\x80\x94bridge the\r\ndark stream that has kept us so thoroughly apart. We shall have at\r\nlast, in the consequences of his act, something we can definitely talk\r\nabout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was silent a little. \xe2\x80\x9cHow wonderfully you take it! But you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nalways wonderful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had a pause that matched her own; then he had, with an adequate\r\nspirit, a complete admission. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite true. I\xe2\x80\x99m extremely wonderful\r\njust now. I dare say in fact I\xe2\x80\x99m quite fantastic, and I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be at\r\nall surprised if I were mad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d she earnestly pressed. As he, however, for the time\r\nanswered nothing, only returning the look with which she watched him,\r\nshe presented herself where it was easier to meet her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will Mr.\r\nWaymarsh exactly have done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimply have written a letter. One will have been quite enough. He has\r\ntold them I want looking after.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd _do_ you?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she was all interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImmensely. And I shall get it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy which you mean you don\xe2\x80\x99t budge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t budge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve cabled?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve made Chad do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you decline to come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat _he_ declines. We had it out this morning and I brought him\r\nround. He had come in, before I was down, to tell me he was\r\nready\xe2\x80\x94ready, I mean, to return. And he went off, after ten minutes with\r\nme, to say he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey followed with intensity. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99ve _stopped_ him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether settled himself afresh in his chair. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve stopped him. That\r\nis for the time. That\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he gave it to her more vividly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cis where I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see, I see. But where\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Newsome? He was ready,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\ngo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd sincerely\xe2\x80\x94believing _you\xe2\x80\x99d_ be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly, I think; so that he was amazed to find the hand I had laid\r\non him to pull him over suddenly converted into an engine for keeping\r\nhim still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was an account of the matter Miss Gostrey could weigh. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes he\r\nthink the conversion sudden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not altogether sure what he thinks. I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nsure of anything that concerns him, except that the more I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen of\r\nhim the less I\xe2\x80\x99ve found him what I originally expected. He\xe2\x80\x99s obscure,\r\nand that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m waiting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut for what in particular?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the answer to his cable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what was his cable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether replied; \xe2\x80\x9cit was to be, when he left me,\r\naccording to his own taste. I simply said to him: \xe2\x80\x98I want to stay, and\r\nthe only way for me to do so is for _you_ to.\xe2\x80\x99 That I wanted to stay\r\nseemed to interest him, and he acted on that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey turned it over. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wants then himself to stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe half wants it. That is he half wants to go. My original appeal has\r\nto that extent worked in him. Nevertheless,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether pursued, \xe2\x80\x9che\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t go. Not, at least, so long as I\xe2\x80\x99m here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d his companion suggested, \xe2\x80\x9cstay here always. I wish you\r\ncould.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means. Still, I want to see him a little further. He\xe2\x80\x99s not in\r\nthe least the case I supposed, he\xe2\x80\x99s quite another case. And it\xe2\x80\x99s as\r\nsuch that he interests me.\xe2\x80\x9d It was almost as if for his own\r\nintelligence that, deliberate and lucid, our friend thus expressed the\r\nmatter. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give him up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey but desired to help his lucidity. She had however to be\r\nlight and tactful. \xe2\x80\x9cUp, you mean\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94to his mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m not thinking of his mother now. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of the plan of\r\nwhich I was the mouthpiece, which, as soon as we met, I put before him\r\nas persuasively as I knew how, and which was drawn up, as it were, in\r\ncomplete ignorance of all that, in this last long period, has been\r\nhappening to him. It took no account whatever of the impression I was\r\nhere on the spot immediately to begin to receive from him\xe2\x80\x94impressions\r\nof which I feel sure I\xe2\x80\x99m far from having had the last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey had a smile of the most genial criticism. \xe2\x80\x9cSo your idea\r\nis\xe2\x80\x94more or less\xe2\x80\x94to stay out of curiosity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall it what you like! I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what it\xe2\x80\x99s called\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo long as you do stay? Certainly not then. I call it, all the same,\r\nimmense fun,\xe2\x80\x9d Maria Gostrey declared; \xe2\x80\x9cand to see you work it out will\r\nbe one of the sensations of my life. It _is_ clear you can toddle\r\nalone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe received this tribute without elation. \xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t be alone when the\r\nPococks have come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyebrows went up. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Pococks are coming?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, I mean, is what will happen\xe2\x80\x94and happen as quickly as possible\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nconsequence of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s cable. They\xe2\x80\x99ll simply embark. Sarah will come to\r\nspeak for her mother\xe2\x80\x94with an effect different from _my_ muddle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey more gravely wondered. \xe2\x80\x9c_She_ then will take him back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery possibly\xe2\x80\x94and we shall see. She must at any rate have the chance,\r\nand she may be trusted to do all she can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you _want_ that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cI want it. I want to play fair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she had lost for a moment the thread. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it devolves on the\r\nPococks why do you stay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust to see that I _do_ play fair\xe2\x80\x94and a little also, no doubt, that\r\nthey do.\xe2\x80\x9d Strether was luminous as he had never been. \xe2\x80\x9cI came out to\r\nfind myself in presence of new facts\xe2\x80\x94facts that have kept striking me\r\nas less and less met by our old reasons. The matter\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly simple.\r\nNew reasons\xe2\x80\x94reasons as new as the facts themselves\xe2\x80\x94are wanted; and of\r\nthis our friends at Woollett\xe2\x80\x94Chad\xe2\x80\x99s and mine\xe2\x80\x94were at the earliest\r\nmoment definitely notified. If any are producible Mrs. Pocock will\r\nproduce them; she\xe2\x80\x99ll bring over the whole collection. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded with a pensive smile \xe2\x80\x9ca part of the \xe2\x80\x98fun\xe2\x80\x99 you speak of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was quite in the current now and floating by his side. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMamie\xe2\x80\x94so far as I\xe2\x80\x99ve had it from you\xe2\x80\x94who\xe2\x80\x99ll be their great card.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthen as his contemplative silence wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a denial she significantly\r\nadded: \xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think _I_ am!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and Strether sprang up, moving about a little as her\r\neyes followed him. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean her coming out can\xe2\x80\x99t be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe explained after another turn what he meant. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only way for her\r\nnot to come is for me to go home\xe2\x80\x94as I believe that on the spot I could\r\nprevent it. But the difficulty as to that is that if I do go home\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see, I see\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she had easily understood. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Newsome will do the\r\nsame, and that\xe2\x80\x99s not\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she laughed out now\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto be thought of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether had no laugh; he had only a quiet comparatively placid look\r\nthat might have shown him as proof against ridicule. \xe2\x80\x9cStrange, isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had, in the matter that so much interested them, come so far as\r\nthis without sounding another name\xe2\x80\x94to which however their present\r\nmomentary silence was full of a conscious reference. Strether\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquestion was a sufficient implication of the weight it had gained with\r\nhim during the absence of his hostess; and just for that reason a\r\nsingle gesture from her could pass for him as a vivid answer. Yet he\r\nwas answered still better when she said in a moment: \xe2\x80\x9cWill Mr. Newsome\r\nintroduce his sister\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Madame de Vionnet?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether spoke the name at last. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be\r\ngreatly surprised if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seemed to gaze at the possibility. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean you\xe2\x80\x99ve thought of it\r\nand you\xe2\x80\x99re prepared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve thought of it and I\xe2\x80\x99m prepared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was to her visitor now that she applied her consideration. \xe2\x80\x9cBon! You\r\n_are_ magnificent!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered after a pause and a little wearily, but still\r\nstanding there before her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwell, that\xe2\x80\x99s what, just once in all my dull\r\ndays, I think I shall like to have been!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo days later he had news from Chad of a communication from Woollett\r\nin response to their determinant telegram, this missive being addressed\r\nto Chad himself and announcing the immediate departure for France of\r\nSarah and Jim and Mamie. Strether had meanwhile on his own side cabled;\r\nhe had but delayed that act till after his visit to Miss Gostrey, an\r\ninterview by which, as so often before, he felt his sense of things\r\ncleared up and settled. His message to Mrs. Newsome, in answer to her\r\nown, had consisted of the words: \xe2\x80\x9cJudge best to take another month, but\r\nwith full appreciation of all re-enforcements.\xe2\x80\x9d He had added that he\r\nwas writing, but he was of course always writing; it was a practice\r\nthat continued, oddly enough, to relieve him, to make him come nearer\r\nthan anything else to the consciousness of doing something: so that he\r\noften wondered if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t really, under his recent stress, acquired\r\nsome hollow trick, one of the specious arts of make-believe. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthe pages he still so freely dispatched by the American post have been\r\nworthy of a showy journalist, some master of the great new science of\r\nbeating the sense out of words? Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he writing against time, and\r\nmainly to show he was kind?\xe2\x80\x94since it had become quite his habit not to\r\nlike to read himself over. On those lines he could still be liberal,\r\nyet it was at best a sort of whistling in the dark. It was\r\nunmistakeable moreover that the sense of being in the dark now pressed\r\non him more sharply\xe2\x80\x94creating thereby the need for a louder and livelier\r\nwhistle. He whistled long and hard after sending his message; he\r\nwhistled again and again in celebration of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s news; there was an\r\ninterval of a fortnight in which this exercise helped him. He had no\r\ngreat notion of what, on the spot, Sarah Pocock would have to say,\r\nthough he had indeed confused premonitions; but it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in her\r\npower to say\xe2\x80\x94it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in any one\xe2\x80\x99s anywhere to say\xe2\x80\x94that he was\r\nneglecting her mother. He might have written before more freely, but he\r\nhad never written more copiously; and he frankly gave for a reason at\r\nWoollett that he wished to fill the void created there by Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nThe increase of his darkness, however, and the quickening, as I have\r\ncalled it, of his tune, resided in the fact that he was hearing almost\r\nnothing. He had for some time been aware that he was hearing less than\r\nbefore, and he was now clearly following a process by which Mrs.\r\nNewsome\xe2\x80\x99s letters could but logically stop. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had a line for\r\nmany days, and he needed no proof\xe2\x80\x94though he was, in time, to have\r\nplenty\xe2\x80\x94that she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have put pen to paper after receiving the hint\r\nthat had determined her telegram. She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t write till Sarah should\r\nhave seen him and reported on him. It was strange, though it might well\r\nbe less so than his own behaviour appeared at Woollett. It was at any\r\nrate significant, and what _was_ remarkable was the way his friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnature and manner put on for him, through this very drop of\r\ndemonstration, a greater intensity. It struck him really that he had\r\nnever so lived with her as during this period of her silence; the\r\nsilence was a sacred hush, a finer clearer medium, in which her\r\nidiosyncrasies showed. He walked about with her, sat with her, drove\r\nwith her and dined face-to-face with her\xe2\x80\x94a rare treat \xe2\x80\x9cin his life,\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\nhe could perhaps have scarce escaped phrasing it; and if he had never\r\nseen her so soundless he had never, on the other hand, felt her so\r\nhighly, so almost austerely, herself: pure and by the vulgar estimate\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccold,\xe2\x80\x9d but deep devoted delicate sensitive noble. Her vividness in\r\nthese respects became for him, in the special conditions, almost an\r\nobsession; and though the obsession sharpened his pulses, adding really\r\nto the excitement of life, there were hours at which, to be less on the\r\nstretch, he directly sought forgetfulness. He knew it for the queerest\r\nof adventures\xe2\x80\x94a circumstance capable of playing such a part only for\r\nLambert Strether\xe2\x80\x94that in Paris itself, of all places, he should find\r\nthis ghost of the lady of Woollett more importunate than any other\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nWhen he went back to Maria Gostrey it was for the change to something\r\nelse. And yet after all the change scarcely operated for he talked to\r\nher of Mrs. Newsome in these days as he had never talked before. He had\r\nhitherto observed in that particular a discretion and a law;\r\nconsiderations that at present broke down quite as if relations had\r\naltered. They hadn\xe2\x80\x99t _really_ altered, he said to himself, so much as\r\nthat came to; for if what had occurred was of course that Mrs. Newsome\r\nhad ceased to trust him, there was nothing on the other hand to prove\r\nthat he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t win back her confidence. It was quite his present\r\ntheory that he would leave no stone unturned to do so; and in fact if\r\nhe now told Maria things about her that he had never told before this\r\nwas largely because it kept before him the idea of the honour of such a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s esteem. His relation with Maria as well was, strangely enough,\r\nno longer quite the same; this truth\xe2\x80\x94though not too disconcertingly\xe2\x80\x94had\r\ncome up between them on the renewal of their meetings. It was all\r\ncontained in what she had then almost immediately said to him; it was\r\nrepresented by the remark she had needed but ten minutes to make and\r\nthat he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been disposed to gainsay. He could toddle alone, and the\r\ndifference that showed was extraordinary. The turn taken by their talk\r\nhad promptly confirmed this difference; his larger confidence on the\r\nscore of Mrs. Newsome did the rest; and the time seemed already far off\r\nwhen he had held out his small thirsty cup to the spout of her pail.\r\nHer pail was scarce touched now, and other fountains had flowed for\r\nhim; she fell into her place as but one of his tributaries; and there\r\nwas a strange sweetness\xe2\x80\x94a melancholy mildness that touched him\xe2\x80\x94in her\r\nacceptance of the altered order.\r\n\r\nIt marked for himself the flight of time, or at any rate what he was\r\npleased to think of with irony and pity as the rush of experience; it\r\nhaving been but the day before yesterday that he sat at her feet and\r\nheld on by her garment and was fed by her hand. It was the proportions\r\nthat were changed, and the proportions were at all times, he\r\nphilosophised, the very conditions of perception, the terms of thought.\r\nIt was as if, with her effective little _entresol_ and and her wide\r\nacquaintance, her activities, varieties, promiscuities, the duties and\r\ndevotions that took up nine tenths of her time and of which he got,\r\nguardedly, but the side-wind\xe2\x80\x94it was as if she had shrunk to a secondary\r\nelement and had consented to the shrinkage with the perfection of tact.\r\nThis perfection had never failed her; it had originally been greater\r\nthan his prime measure for it; it had kept him quite apart, kept him\r\nout of the shop, as she called her huge general acquaintance, made\r\ntheir commerce as quiet, as much a thing of the home alone\xe2\x80\x94the opposite\r\nof the shop\xe2\x80\x94as if she had never another customer. She had been\r\nwonderful to him at first, with the memory of her little _entresol_,\r\nthe image to which, on most mornings at that time, his eyes directly\r\nopened; but now she mainly figured for him as but part of the bristling\r\ntotal\xe2\x80\x94though of course always as a person to whom he should never cease\r\nto be indebted. It would never be given to him certainly to inspire a\r\ngreater kindness. She had decked him out for others, and he saw at this\r\npoint at least nothing she would ever ask for. She only wondered and\r\nquestioned and listened, rendering him the homage of a wistful\r\nspeculation. She expressed it repeatedly; he was already far beyond\r\nher, and she must prepare herself to lose him. There was but one little\r\nchance for her.\r\n\r\nOften as she had said it he met it\xe2\x80\x94for it was a touch he liked\xe2\x80\x94each\r\ntime the same way. \xe2\x80\x9cMy coming to grief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94then I might patch you up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh for my real smash, if it takes place, there will be no patching.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you surely don\xe2\x80\x99t mean it will kill you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94worse. It will make me old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh nothing can do that! The wonderful and special thing about you is\r\nthat you _are_, at this time of day, youth.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she always made,\r\nfurther, one of those remarks that she had completely ceased to adorn\r\nwith hesitations or apologies, and that had, by the same token, in\r\nspite of their extreme straightness, ceased to produce in Strether the\r\nleast embarrassment. She made him believe them, and they became thereby\r\nas impersonal as truth itself. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just your particular charm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis answer too was always the same. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I\xe2\x80\x99m youth\xe2\x80\x94youth for the\r\ntrip to Europe. I began to be young, or at least to get the benefit of\r\nit, the moment I met you at Chester, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what has been taking\r\nplace ever since. I never had the benefit at the proper time\xe2\x80\x94which\r\ncomes to saying that I never had the thing itself. I\xe2\x80\x99m having the\r\nbenefit at this moment; I had it the other day when I said to Chad\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wait\xe2\x80\x99; I shall have it still again when Sarah Pocock arrives. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nbenefit that would make a poor show for many people; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwho else but you and I, frankly, could begin to see in it what I feel.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t get drunk; I don\xe2\x80\x99t pursue the ladies; I don\xe2\x80\x99t spend money; I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t even write sonnets. But nevertheless I\xe2\x80\x99m making up late for what\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t have early. I cultivate my little benefit in my own little\r\nway. It amuses me more than anything that has happened to me in all my\r\nlife. They may say what they like\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s my surrender, it\xe2\x80\x99s my tribute,\r\nto youth. One puts that in where one can\xe2\x80\x94it has to come in somewhere,\r\nif only out of the lives, the conditions, the feelings of other\r\npersons. Chad gives me the sense of it, for all his grey hairs, which\r\nmerely make it solid in him and safe and serene; and _she_ does the\r\nsame, for all her being older than he, for all her marriageable\r\ndaughter, her separated husband, her agitated history. Though they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nyoung enough, my pair, I don\xe2\x80\x99t say they\xe2\x80\x99re, in the freshest way, their\r\n_own_ absolutely prime adolescence; for that has nothing to do with it.\r\nThe point is that they\xe2\x80\x99re mine. Yes, they\xe2\x80\x99re my youth; since somehow at\r\nthe right time nothing else ever was. What I meant just now therefore\r\nis that it would all go\xe2\x80\x94go before doing its work\xe2\x80\x94if they were to fail\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn which, just here, Miss Gostrey inveterately questioned. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do\r\nyou, in particular, call its work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to see me through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut through what?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she liked to get it all out of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy through this experience.\xe2\x80\x9d That was all that would come.\r\n\r\nIt regularly gave her none the less the last word. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you remember\r\nhow in those first days of our meeting it was _I_ who was to see you\r\nthrough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember? Tenderly, deeply\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he always rose to it. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re just doing\r\nyour part in letting me maunder to you thus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh don\xe2\x80\x99t speak as if my part were small; since whatever else fails\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ won\xe2\x80\x99t, ever, ever, ever?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he thus took her up. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I beg your\r\npardon; you necessarily, you inevitably _will_. Your conditions\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat I mean\xe2\x80\x94won\xe2\x80\x99t allow me anything to do for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet alone\xe2\x80\x94I see what you mean\xe2\x80\x94that I\xe2\x80\x99m drearily dreadfully old. I\r\n_am_, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a service\xe2\x80\x94possible for you to render\xe2\x80\x94that I know, all\r\nthe same, I shall think of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what will it be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis, in fine, however, she would never tell him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall hear only\r\nif your smash takes place. As that\xe2\x80\x99s really out of the question, I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t expose myself\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a point at which, for reasons of his own, Strether\r\nceased to press.\r\n\r\nHe came round, for publicity\xe2\x80\x94it was the easiest thing\xe2\x80\x94to the idea that\r\nhis smash _was_ out of the question, and this rendered idle the\r\ndiscussion of what might follow it. He attached an added importance, as\r\nthe days elapsed, to the arrival of the Pococks; he had even a shameful\r\nsense of waiting for it insincerely and incorrectly. He accused himself\r\nof making believe to his own mind that Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s presence, her\r\nimpression, her judgement would simplify and harmonise, he accused\r\nhimself of being so afraid of what they _might_ do that he sought\r\nrefuge, to beg the whole question, in a vain fury. He had abundantly\r\nseen at home what they were in the habit of doing, and he had not at\r\npresent the smallest ground. His clearest vision was when he made out\r\nthat what he most desired was an account more full and free of Mrs.\r\nNewsome\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind than any he felt he could now expect from\r\nherself; that calculation at least went hand in hand with the sharp\r\nconsciousness of wishing to prove to himself that he was not afraid to\r\nlook his behaviour in the face. If he was by an inexorable logic to pay\r\nfor it he was literally impatient to know the cost, and he held himself\r\nready to pay in instalments. The first instalment would be precisely\r\nthis entertainment of Sarah; as a consequence of which moreover, he\r\nshould know vastly better how he stood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook Eighth\r\n\r\n\r\n I\r\n\r\nStrether rambled alone during these few days, the effect of the\r\nincident of the previous week having been to simplify in a marked\r\nfashion his mixed relations with Waymarsh. Nothing had passed between\r\nthem in reference to Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s summons but that our friend had\r\nmentioned to his own the departure of the deputation actually at\r\nsea\xe2\x80\x94giving him thus an opportunity to confess to the occult\r\nintervention he imputed to him. Waymarsh however in the event confessed\r\nto nothing; and though this falsified in some degree Strether\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nforecast the latter amusedly saw in it the same depth of good\r\nconscience out of which the dear man\xe2\x80\x99s impertinence had originally\r\nsprung. He was patient with the dear man now and delighted to observe\r\nhow unmistakeably he had put on flesh; he felt his own holiday so\r\nsuccessfully large and free that he was full of allowances and\r\ncharities in respect to those cabined and confined: his instinct toward\r\na spirit so strapped down as Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s was to walk round it on tiptoe\r\nfor fear of waking it up to a sense of losses by this time\r\nirretrievable. It was all very funny he knew, and but the difference,\r\nas he often said to himself, of tweedledum and tweedledee\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nemancipation so purely comparative that it was like the advance of the\r\ndoor-mat on the scraper; yet the present crisis was happily to profit\r\nby it and the pilgrim from Milrose to know himself more than ever in\r\nthe right.\r\n\r\nStrether felt that when he heard of the approach of the Pococks the\r\nimpulse of pity quite sprang up in him beside the impulse of triumph.\r\nThat was exactly why Waymarsh had looked at him with eyes in which the\r\nheat of justice was measured and shaded. He had looked very hard, as if\r\naffectionately sorry for the friend\xe2\x80\x94the friend of fifty-five\xe2\x80\x94whose\r\nfrivolity had had thus to be recorded; becoming, however, but obscurely\r\nsententious and leaving his companion to formulate a charge. It was in\r\nthis general attitude that he had of late altogether taken refuge; with\r\nthe drop of discussion they were solemnly sadly superficial; Strether\r\nrecognised in him the mere portentous rumination to which Miss Barrace\r\nhad so good-humouredly described herself as assigning a corner of her\r\nsalon. It was quite as if he knew his surreptitious step had been\r\ndivined, and it was also as if he missed the chance to explain the\r\npurity of his motive; but this privation of relief should be precisely\r\nhis small penance: it was not amiss for Strether that he should find\r\nhimself to that degree uneasy. If he had been challenged or accused,\r\nrebuked for meddling or otherwise pulled up, he would probably have\r\nshown, on his own system, all the height of his consistency, all the\r\ndepth of his good faith. Explicit resentment of his course would have\r\nmade him take the floor, and the thump of his fist on the table would\r\nhave affirmed him as consciously incorruptible. Had what now really\r\nprevailed with Strether been but a dread of that thump\xe2\x80\x94a dread of\r\nwincing a little painfully at what it might invidiously demonstrate?\r\nHowever this might be, at any rate, one of the marks of the crisis was\r\na visible, a studied lapse, in Waymarsh, of betrayed concern. As if to\r\nmake up to his comrade for the stroke by which he had played providence\r\nhe now conspicuously ignored his movements, withdrew himself from the\r\npretension to share them, stiffened up his sensibility to neglect, and,\r\nclasping his large empty hands and swinging his large restless foot,\r\nclearly looked to another quarter for justice.\r\n\r\nThis made for independence on Strether\xe2\x80\x99s part, and he had in truth at\r\nno moment of his stay been so free to go and come. The early summer\r\nbrushed the picture over and blurred everything but the near; it made a\r\nvast warm fragrant medium in which the elements floated together on the\r\nbest of terms, in which rewards were immediate and reckonings\r\npostponed. Chad was out of town again, for the first time since his\r\nvisitor\xe2\x80\x99s first view of him; he had explained this necessity\xe2\x80\x94without\r\ndetail, yet also without embarrassment, the circumstance was one of\r\nthose which, in the young man\xe2\x80\x99s life, testified to the variety of his\r\nties. Strether wasn\xe2\x80\x99t otherwise concerned with it than for its so\r\ntestifying\xe2\x80\x94a pleasant multitudinous image in which he took comfort. He\r\ntook comfort, by the same stroke, in the swing of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s pendulum back\r\nfrom that other swing, the sharp jerk towards Woollett, so stayed by\r\nhis own hand. He had the entertainment of thinking that if he had for\r\nthat moment stopped the clock it was to promote the next minute this\r\nstill livelier motion. He himself did what he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done before; he\r\ntook two or three times whole days off\xe2\x80\x94irrespective of others, of two\r\nor three taken with Miss Gostrey, two or three taken with little\r\nBilham: he went to Chartres and cultivated, before the front of the\r\ncathedral, a general easy beatitude; he went to Fontainebleau and\r\nimagined himself on the way to Italy; he went to Rouen with a little\r\nhandbag and inordinately spent the night.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon he did something quite different; finding himself in the\r\nneighbourhood of a fine old house across the river, he passed under the\r\ngreat arch of its doorway and asked at the porter\xe2\x80\x99s lodge for Madame de\r\nVionnet. He had already hovered more than once about that possibility,\r\nbeen aware of it, in the course of ostensible strolls, as lurking but\r\nround the corner. Only it had perversely happened, after his morning at\r\nNotre Dame, that his consistency, as he considered and intended it, had\r\ncome back to him; whereby he had reflected that the encounter in\r\nquestion had been none of his making; clinging again intensely to the\r\nstrength of his position, which was precisely that there was nothing in\r\nit for himself. From the moment he actively pursued the charming\r\nassociate of his adventure, from that moment his position weakened, for\r\nhe was then acting in an interested way. It was only within a few days\r\nthat he had fixed himself a limit: he promised himself his consistency\r\nshould end with Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s arrival. It was arguing correctly to feel the\r\ntitle to a free hand conferred on him by this event. If he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to be\r\nlet alone he should be merely a dupe to act with delicacy. If he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nto be trusted he could at least take his ease. If he was to be placed\r\nunder control he gained leave to try what his position _might_\r\nagreeably give him. An ideal rigour would perhaps postpone the trial\r\ntill after the Pococks had shown their spirit; and it was to an ideal\r\nrigour that he had quite promised himself to conform.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, however, on this particular day, he felt a particular fear\r\nunder which everything collapsed. He knew abruptly that he was afraid\r\nof himself\xe2\x80\x94and yet not in relation to the effect on his sensibilities\r\nof another hour of Madame de Vionnet. What he dreaded was the effect of\r\na single hour of Sarah Pocock, as to whom he was visited, in troubled\r\nnights, with fantastic waking dreams. She loomed at him larger than\r\nlife; she increased in volume as she drew nearer; she so met his eyes\r\nthat, his imagination taking, after the first step, all, and more than\r\nall, the strides, he already felt her come down on him, already burned,\r\nunder her reprobation, with the blush of guilt, already consented, by\r\nway of penance, to the instant forfeiture of everything. He saw\r\nhimself, under her direction, recommitted to Woollett as juvenile\r\noffenders are committed to reformatories. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t of course that\r\nWoollett was really a place of discipline; but he knew in advance that\r\nSarah\xe2\x80\x99s salon at the hotel would be. His danger, at any rate, in such\r\nmoods of alarm, was some concession, on this ground, that would involve\r\na sharp rupture with the actual; therefore if he waited to take leave\r\nof that actual he might wholly miss his chance. It was represented with\r\nsupreme vividness by Madame de Vionnet, and that is why, in a word, he\r\nwaited no longer. He had seen in a flash that he must anticipate Mrs.\r\nPocock. He was accordingly much disappointed on now learning from the\r\nportress that the lady of his quest was not in Paris. She had gone for\r\nsome days to the country. There was nothing in this accident but what\r\nwas natural; yet it produced for poor Strether a drop of all\r\nconfidence. It was suddenly as if he should never see her again, and as\r\nif moreover he had brought it on himself by not having been quite kind\r\nto her.\r\n\r\nIt was the advantage of his having let his fancy lose itself for a\r\nlittle in the gloom that, as by reaction, the prospect began really to\r\nbrighten from the moment the deputation from Woollett alighted on the\r\nplatform of the station. They had come straight from Havre, having\r\nsailed from New York to that port, and having also, thanks to a happy\r\nvoyage, made land with a promptitude that left Chad Newsome, who had\r\nmeant to meet them at the dock, belated. He had received their\r\ntelegram, with the announcement of their immediate further advance,\r\njust as he was taking the train for Havre, so that nothing had remained\r\nfor him but to await them in Paris. He hastily picked up Strether, at\r\nthe hotel, for this purpose, and he even, with easy pleasantry,\r\nsuggested the attendance of Waymarsh as well\xe2\x80\x94Waymarsh, at the moment\r\nhis cab rattled up, being engaged, under Strether\xe2\x80\x99s contemplative\r\nrange, in a grave perambulation of the familiar court. Waymarsh had\r\nlearned from his companion, who had already had a note, delivered by\r\nhand, from Chad, that the Pococks were due, and had ambiguously,\r\nthough, as always, impressively, glowered at him over the circumstance;\r\ncarrying himself in a manner in which Strether was now expert enough to\r\nrecognise his uncertainty, in the premises, as to the best tone. The\r\nonly tone he aimed at with confidence was a full tone\xe2\x80\x94which was\r\nnecessarily difficult in the absence of a full knowledge. The Pococks\r\nwere a quantity as yet unmeasured, and, as he had practically brought\r\nthem over, so this witness had to that extent exposed himself. He\r\nwanted to feel right about it, but could only, at the best, for the\r\ntime, feel vague. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall look to you, you know, immensely,\xe2\x80\x9d our\r\nfriend had said, \xe2\x80\x9cto help me with them,\xe2\x80\x9d and he had been quite\r\nconscious of the effect of the remark, and of others of the same sort,\r\non his comrade\xe2\x80\x99s sombre sensibility. He had insisted on the fact that\r\nWaymarsh would quite like Mrs. Pocock\xe2\x80\x94one could be certain he would: he\r\nwould be with her about everything, and she would also be with _him_,\r\nand Miss Barrace\xe2\x80\x99s nose, in short, would find itself out of joint.\r\n\r\nStrether had woven this web of cheerfulness while they waited in the\r\ncourt for Chad; he had sat smoking cigarettes to keep himself quiet\r\nwhile, caged and leonine, his fellow traveller paced and turned before\r\nhim. Chad Newsome was doubtless to be struck, when he arrived, with the\r\nsharpness of their opposition at this particular hour; he was to\r\nremember, as a part of it, how Waymarsh came with him and with Strether\r\nto the street and stood there with a face half-wistful and half-rueful.\r\nThey talked of him, the two others, as they drove, and Strether put\r\nChad in possession of much of his own strained sense of things. He had\r\nalready, a few days before, named to him the wire he was convinced\r\ntheir friend had pulled\xe2\x80\x94a confidence that had made on the young man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npart quite hugely for curiosity and diversion. The action of the\r\nmatter, moreover, Strether could see, was to penetrate; he saw that is,\r\nhow Chad judged a system of influence in which Waymarsh had served as a\r\ndeterminant\xe2\x80\x94an impression just now quickened again; with the whole\r\nbearing of such a fact on the youth\xe2\x80\x99s view of his relatives. As it came\r\nup between them that they might now take their friend for a feature of\r\nthe control of these latter now sought to be exerted from Woollett,\r\nStrether felt indeed how it would be stamped all over him, half an hour\r\nlater for Sarah Pocock\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, that he was as much on Chad\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cside\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\nWaymarsh had probably described him. He was letting himself at present,\r\ngo; there was no denying it; it might be desperation, it might be\r\nconfidence; he should offer himself to the arriving travellers\r\nbristling with all the lucidity he had cultivated.\r\n\r\nHe repeated to Chad what he had been saying in the court to Waymarsh;\r\nhow there was no doubt whatever that his sister would find the latter a\r\nkindred spirit, no doubt of the alliance, based on an exchange of\r\nviews, that the pair would successfully strike up. They would become as\r\nthick as thieves\xe2\x80\x94which moreover was but a development of what Strether\r\nremembered to have said in one of his first discussions with his mate,\r\nstruck as he had then already been with the elements of affinity\r\nbetween that personage and Mrs. Newsome herself. \xe2\x80\x9cI told him, one day,\r\nwhen he had questioned me on your mother, that she was a person who,\r\nwhen he should know her, would rouse in him, I was sure, a special\r\nenthusiasm; and that hangs together with the conviction we now\r\nfeel\xe2\x80\x94this certitude that Mrs. Pocock will take him into her boat. For\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s your mother\xe2\x80\x99s own boat that she\xe2\x80\x99s pulling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chad, \xe2\x80\x9cMother\xe2\x80\x99s worth fifty of Sally!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA thousand; but when you presently meet her, all the same you\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nmeeting your mother\xe2\x80\x99s representative\xe2\x80\x94just as I shall. I feel like the\r\noutgoing ambassador,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cdoing honour to his appointed\r\nsuccessor.\xe2\x80\x9d A moment after speaking as he had just done he felt he had\r\ninadvertently rather cheapened Mrs. Newsome to her son; an impression\r\naudibly reflected, as at first seen, in Chad\xe2\x80\x99s prompt protest. He had\r\nrecently rather failed of apprehension of the young man\xe2\x80\x99s attitude and\r\ntemper\xe2\x80\x94remaining principally conscious of how little worry, at the\r\nworst, he wasted, and he studied him at this critical hour with renewed\r\ninterest. Chad had done exactly what he had promised him a fortnight\r\nprevious\xe2\x80\x94had accepted without another question his plea for delay. He\r\nwas waiting cheerfully and handsomely, but also inscrutably and with a\r\nslight increase perhaps of the hardness originally involved in his\r\nacquired high polish. He was neither excited nor depressed; was easy\r\nand acute and deliberate\xe2\x80\x94unhurried unflurried unworried, only at most a\r\nlittle less amused than usual. Strether felt him more than ever a\r\njustification of the extraordinary process of which his own absurd\r\nspirit had been the arena; he knew as their cab rolled along, knew as\r\nhe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even yet known, that nothing else than what Chad had done and\r\nhad been would have led to his present showing. They had made him,\r\nthese things, what he was, and the business hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been easy; it had\r\ntaken time and trouble, it had cost, above all, a price. The result at\r\nany rate was now to be offered to Sally; which Strether, so far as that\r\nwas concerned, was glad to be there to witness. Would she in the least\r\nmake it out or take it in, the result, or would she in the least care\r\nfor it if she did? He scratched his chin as he asked himself by what\r\nname, when challenged\xe2\x80\x94as he was sure he should be\xe2\x80\x94he could call it for\r\nher. Oh those were determinations she must herself arrive at; since she\r\nwanted so much to see, let her see then and welcome. She had come out\r\nin the pride of her competence, yet it hummed in Strether\xe2\x80\x99s inner sense\r\nthat she practically wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see.\r\n\r\nThat this was moreover what Chad shrewdly suspected was clear from a\r\nword that next dropped from him. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re children; they play at\r\nlife!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and the exclamation was significant and reassuring. It implied\r\nthat he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t then, for his companion\xe2\x80\x99s sensibility, appeared to give\r\nMrs. Newsome away; and it facilitated our friend\xe2\x80\x99s presently asking him\r\nif it were his idea that Mrs. Pocock and Madame de Vionnet should\r\nbecome acquainted. Strether was still more sharply struck, hereupon,\r\nwith Chad\xe2\x80\x99s lucidity. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that exactly\xe2\x80\x94to get a sight of the\r\ncompany I keep\xe2\x80\x94what she has come out for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it is,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether unguardedly replied.\r\n\r\nChad\xe2\x80\x99s quick rejoinder lighted his precipitation. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you say\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re afraid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, because I feel a certain responsibility. It\xe2\x80\x99s my testimony, I\r\nimagine, that will have been at the bottom of Mrs. Pocock\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity.\r\nMy letters, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve supposed you to understand from the beginning, have\r\nspoken freely. I\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly said my little say about Madame de\r\nVionnet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll that, for Chad, was beautifully obvious. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve only\r\nspoken handsomely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever more handsomely of any woman. But it\xe2\x80\x99s just that tone\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat tone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chad, \xe2\x80\x9cthat has fetched her? I dare say; but I\xe2\x80\x99ve no\r\nquarrel with you about it. And no more has Madame de Vionnet. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nknow by this time how she likes you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and Strether had, with his groan, a real pang of melancholy. \xe2\x80\x9cFor\r\nall I\xe2\x80\x99ve done for her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh you\xe2\x80\x99ve done a great deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad\xe2\x80\x99s urbanity fairly shamed him, and he was at this moment absolutely\r\nimpatient to see the face Sarah Pocock would present to a sort of\r\nthing, as he synthetically phrased it to himself, with no adequate\r\nforecast of which, despite his admonitions, she would certainly arrive.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done _this!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this is all right. She likes,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad comfortably remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cto be\r\nliked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIt gave his companion a moment\xe2\x80\x99s thought. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd she\xe2\x80\x99s sure Mrs. Pocock\r\n_will_\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I say that for you. She likes your liking her; it\xe2\x80\x99s so much, as it\r\nwere,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cto the good. However, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t despair of\r\nSarah either, and is prepared, on her own side, to go all lengths.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the way of appreciation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and of everything else. In the way of general amiability,\r\nhospitality and welcome. She\xe2\x80\x99s under arms,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad laughed again; \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprepared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether took it in; then as if an echo of Miss Barrace were in the\r\nair: \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t begin to know _how_ wonderful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a depth in it, to Strether\xe2\x80\x99s ear, of confirmed luxury\xe2\x80\x94almost\r\na kind of unconscious insolence of proprietorship; but the effect of\r\nthe glimpse was not at this moment to foster speculation: there was\r\nsomething so conclusive in so much graceful and generous assurance. It\r\nwas in fact a fresh evocation; and the evocation had before many\r\nminutes another consequence. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I shall see her oftener now. I\r\nshall see her as much as I like\xe2\x80\x94by your leave; which is what I hitherto\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has been,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chad, but without reproach, \xe2\x80\x9conly your own fault. I\r\ntried to bring you together, and _she_, my dear fellow\xe2\x80\x94I never saw her\r\nmore charming to any man. But you\xe2\x80\x99ve got your extraordinary ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I _did_ have,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether murmured, while he felt both how they\r\nhad possessed him and how they had now lost their authority. He\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have traced the sequence to the end, but it was all because of\r\nMrs. Pocock. Mrs. Pocock might be because of Mrs. Newsome, but that was\r\nstill to be proved. What came over him was the sense of having stupidly\r\nfailed to profit where profit would have been precious. It had been\r\nopen to him to see so much more of her, and he had but let the good\r\ndays pass. Fierce in him almost was the resolve to lose no more of\r\nthem, and he whimsically reflected, while at Chad\xe2\x80\x99s side he drew nearer\r\nto his destination, that it was after all Sarah who would have\r\nquickened his chance. What her visit of inquisition might achieve in\r\nother directions was as yet all obscure\xe2\x80\x94only not obscure that it would\r\ndo supremely much to bring two earnest persons together. He had but to\r\nlisten to Chad at this moment to feel it; for Chad was in the act of\r\nremarking to him that they of course both counted on him\xe2\x80\x94he himself and\r\nthe other earnest person\xe2\x80\x94for cheer and support. It was brave to\r\nStrether to hear him talk as if the line of wisdom they had struck out\r\nwas to make things ravishing to the Pococks. No, if Madame de Vionnet\r\ncompassed _that_, compassed the ravishment of the Pococks, Madame de\r\nVionnet would be prodigious. It would be a beautiful plan if it\r\nsucceeded, and it all came to the question of Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s being really\r\nbribeable. The precedent of his own case helped Strether perhaps but\r\nlittle to consider she might prove so; it being distinct that her\r\ncharacter would rather make for every possible difference. This idea of\r\nhis own bribeability set him apart for himself; with the further mark\r\nin fact that his case was absolutely proved. He liked always, where\r\nLambert Strether was concerned, to know the worst, and what he now\r\nseemed to know was not only that he was bribeable, but that he had been\r\neffectually bribed. The only difficulty was that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite have\r\nsaid with what. It was as if he had sold himself, but hadn\xe2\x80\x99t somehow\r\ngot the cash. That, however, was what, characteristically, _would_\r\nhappen to him. It would naturally be his kind of traffic. While he\r\nthought of these things he reminded Chad of the truth they mustn\xe2\x80\x99t lose\r\nsight of\xe2\x80\x94the truth that, with all deference to her susceptibility to\r\nnew interests, Sarah would have come out with a high firm definite\r\npurpose. \xe2\x80\x9cShe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come out, you know, to be bamboozled. We may all\r\nbe ravishing\xe2\x80\x94nothing perhaps can be more easy for us; but she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome out to be ravished. She has come out just simply to take you\r\nhome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh well, with _her_ I\xe2\x80\x99ll go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chad good-humouredly. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll allow _that_.\xe2\x80\x9d And then as for a minute Strether said nothing:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr is your idea that when I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her I shan\xe2\x80\x99t want to go?\xe2\x80\x9d As this\r\nquestion, however, again left his friend silent he presently went on:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy own idea at any rate is that they shall have while they\xe2\x80\x99re here the\r\nbest sort of time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was at this that Strether spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cAh there you are! I think if you\r\nreally wanted to go\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Chad to bring it out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble about our good time. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care what\r\nsort of a time we have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad could always take in the easiest way in the world any ingenious\r\nsuggestion. \xe2\x80\x9cI see. But can I help it? I\xe2\x80\x99m too decent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you\xe2\x80\x99re too decent!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether heavily sighed. And he felt for the\r\nmoment as if it were the preposterous end of his mission.\r\n\r\nIt ministered for the time to this temporary effect that Chad made no\r\nrejoinder. But he spoke again as they came in sight of the station. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou mean to introduce her to Miss Gostrey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs to this Strether was ready. \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut haven\xe2\x80\x99t you told me they know about her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you your mother knows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd won\xe2\x80\x99t she have told Sally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s one of the things I want to see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you find she _has_\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill I then, you mean, bring them together?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chad with his pleasant promptness: \xe2\x80\x9cto show her there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I care very much what she may\r\nthink there\xe2\x80\x99s in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if it represents what Mother thinks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh what _does_ your mother think?\xe2\x80\x9d There was in this some sound of\r\nbewilderment.\r\n\r\nBut they were just driving up, and help, of a sort, might after all be\r\nquite at hand. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that, my dear man, what we\xe2\x80\x99re both just going to\r\nmake out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n II\r\n\r\nStrether quitted the station half an hour later in different company.\r\nChad had taken charge, for the journey to the hotel, of Sarah, Mamie,\r\nthe maid and the luggage, all spaciously installed and conveyed; and it\r\nwas only after the four had rolled away that his companion got into a\r\ncab with Jim. A strange new feeling had come over Strether, in\r\nconsequence of which his spirits had risen; it was as if what had\r\noccurred on the alighting of his critics had been something other than\r\nhis fear, though his fear had yet not been of an instant scene of\r\nviolence. His impression had been nothing but what was inevitable\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nsaid that to himself; yet relief and reassurance had softly dropped\r\nupon him. Nothing could be so odd as to be indebted for these things to\r\nthe look of faces and the sound of voices that had been with him to\r\nsatiety, as he might have said, for years; but he now knew, all the\r\nsame, how uneasy he had felt; that was brought home to him by his\r\npresent sense of a respite. It had come moreover in the flash of an\r\neye, it had come in the smile with which Sarah, whom, at the window of\r\nher compartment, they had effusively greeted from the platform, rustled\r\ndown to them a moment later, fresh and handsome from her cool June\r\nprogress through the charming land. It was only a sign, but enough: she\r\nwas going to be gracious and unallusive, she was going to play the\r\nlarger game\xe2\x80\x94which was still more apparent, after she had emerged from\r\nChad\xe2\x80\x99s arms, in her direct greeting to the valued friend of her family.\r\n\r\nStrether _was_ then as much as ever the valued friend of her family, it\r\nwas something he could at all events go on with; and the manner of his\r\nresponse to it expressed even for himself how little he had enjoyed the\r\nprospect of ceasing to figure in that likeness. He had always seen\r\nSarah gracious\xe2\x80\x94had in fact rarely seen her shy or dry, her marked\r\nthin-lipped smile, intense without brightness and as prompt to act as\r\nthe scrape of a safety-match; the protrusion of her rather remarkably\r\nlong chin, which in her case represented invitation and urbanity, and\r\nnot, as in most others, pugnacity and defiance; the penetration of her\r\nvoice to a distance, the general encouragement and approval of her\r\nmanner, were all elements with which intercourse had made him familiar,\r\nbut which he noted today almost as if she had been a new acquaintance.\r\nThis first glimpse of her had given a brief but vivid accent to her\r\nresemblance to her mother; he could have taken her for Mrs. Newsome\r\nwhile she met his eyes as the train rolled into the station. It was an\r\nimpression that quickly dropped; Mrs. Newsome was much handsomer, and\r\nwhile Sarah inclined to the massive her mother had, at an age, still\r\nthe girdle of a maid; also the latter\xe2\x80\x99s chin was rather short, than\r\nlong, and her smile, by good fortune, much more, oh ever so much more,\r\nmercifully vague. Strether had seen Mrs. Newsome reserved; he had\r\nliterally heard her silent, though he had never known her unpleasant.\r\nIt was the case with Mrs. Pocock that he had known _her_ unpleasant,\r\neven though he had never known her not affable. She had forms of\r\naffability that were in a high degree assertive; nothing for instance\r\nhad ever been more striking than that she was affable to Jim.\r\n\r\nWhat had told in any case at the window of the train was her high clear\r\nforehead, that forehead which her friends, for some reason, always\r\nthought of as a \xe2\x80\x9cbrow\xe2\x80\x9d; the long reach of her eyes\xe2\x80\x94it came out at this\r\njuncture in such a manner as to remind him, oddly enough, also of that\r\nof Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s; and the unusual gloss of her dark hair, dressed and\r\nhatted, after her mother\xe2\x80\x99s refined example, with such an avoidance of\r\nextremes that it was always spoken of at Woollett as \xe2\x80\x9ctheir own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThough this analogy dropped as soon as she was on the platform it had\r\nlasted long enough to make him feel all the advantage, as it were, of\r\nhis relief. The woman at home, the woman to whom he was attached, was\r\nbefore him just long enough to give him again the measure of the\r\nwretchedness, in fact really of the shame, of their having to recognise\r\nthe formation, between them, of a \xe2\x80\x9csplit.\xe2\x80\x9d He had taken this measure in\r\nsolitude and meditation: but the catastrophe, as Sarah steamed up,\r\nlooked for its seconds unprecedentedly dreadful\xe2\x80\x94or proved, more\r\nexactly, altogether unthinkable; so that his finding something free and\r\nfamiliar to respond to brought with it an instant renewal of his\r\nloyalty. He had suddenly sounded the whole depth, had gasped at what he\r\nmight have lost.\r\n\r\nWell, he could now, for the quarter of an hour of their detention hover\r\nabout the travellers as soothingly as if their direct message to him\r\nwas that he had lost nothing. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to have Sarah write to\r\nher mother that night that he was in any way altered or strange. There\r\nhad been times enough for a month when it had seemed to him that he was\r\nstrange, that he was altered, in every way; but that was a matter for\r\nhimself; he knew at least whose business it was _not_; it was not at\r\nall events such a circumstance as Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s own unaided lights would help\r\nher to. Even if she had come out to flash those lights more than yet\r\nappeared she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make much headway against mere pleasantness. He\r\ncounted on being able to be merely pleasant to the end, and if only\r\nfrom incapacity moreover to formulate anything different. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neven formulate to himself his being changed and queer; it had taken\r\nplace, the process, somewhere deep down; Maria Gostrey had caught\r\nglimpses of it; but how was he to fish it up, even if he desired, for\r\nMrs. Pocock? This was then the spirit in which he hovered, and with the\r\neasier throb in it much indebted furthermore to the impression of high\r\nand established adequacy as a pretty girl promptly produced in him by\r\nMamie. He had wondered vaguely\xe2\x80\x94turning over many things in the fidget\r\nof his thoughts\xe2\x80\x94if Mamie _were_ as pretty as Woollett published her; as\r\nto which issue seeing her now again was to be so swept away by\r\nWoollett\xe2\x80\x99s opinion that this consequence really let loose for the\r\nimagination an avalanche of others. There were positively five minutes\r\nin which the last word seemed of necessity to abide with a Woollett\r\nrepresented by a Mamie. This was the sort of truth the place itself\r\nwould feel; it would send her forth in confidence; it would point to\r\nher with triumph; it would take its stand on her with assurance; it\r\nwould be conscious of no requirements she didn\xe2\x80\x99t meet, of no question\r\nshe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t answer.\r\n\r\nWell, it was right, Strether slipped smoothly enough into the\r\ncheerfulness of saying: granted that a community _might_ be best\r\nrepresented by a young lady of twenty-two, Mamie perfectly played the\r\npart, played it as if she were used to it, and looked and spoke and\r\ndressed the character. He wondered if she mightn\xe2\x80\x99t, in the high light\r\nof Paris, a cool full studio-light, becoming yet treacherous, show as\r\ntoo conscious of these matters; but the next moment he felt satisfied\r\nthat her consciousness was after all empty for its size, rather too\r\nsimple than too mixed, and that the kind way with her would be not to\r\ntake many things out of it, but to put as many as possible in. She was\r\nrobust and conveniently tall; just a trifle too bloodlessly fair\r\nperhaps, but with a pleasant public familiar radiance that affirmed her\r\nvitality. She might have been \xe2\x80\x9creceiving\xe2\x80\x9d for Woollett, wherever she\r\nfound herself, and there was something in her manner, her tone, her\r\nmotion, her pretty blue eyes, her pretty perfect teeth and her very\r\nsmall, too small, nose, that immediately placed her, to the fancy,\r\nbetween the windows of a hot bright room in which voices were high\xe2\x80\x94up\r\nat that end to which people were brought to be \xe2\x80\x9cpresented.\xe2\x80\x9d They were\r\nthere to congratulate, these images, and Strether\xe2\x80\x99s renewed vision, on\r\nthis hint, completed the idea. What Mamie was like was the happy bride,\r\nthe bride after the church and just before going away. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\nmere maiden, and yet was only as much married as that quantity came to.\r\nShe was in the brilliant acclaimed festal stage. Well, might it last\r\nher long!\r\n\r\nStrether rejoiced in these things for Chad, who was all genial\r\nattention to the needs of his friends, besides having arranged that his\r\nservant should reinforce him; the ladies were certainly pleasant to\r\nsee, and Mamie would be at any time and anywhere pleasant to exhibit.\r\nShe would look extraordinarily like his young wife\xe2\x80\x94the wife of a\r\nhoneymoon, should he go about with her; but that was his own affair\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nperhaps it was hers; it was at any rate something she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help.\r\nStrether remembered how he had seen him come up with Jeanne de Vionnet\r\nin Gloriani\xe2\x80\x99s garden, and the fancy he had had about that\xe2\x80\x94the fancy\r\nobscured now, thickly overlaid with others; the recollection was during\r\nthese minutes his only note of trouble. He had often, in spite of\r\nhimself, wondered if Chad but too probably were not with Jeanne the\r\nobject of a still and shaded flame. It was on the cards that the child\r\n_might_ be tremulously in love, and this conviction now flickered up\r\nnot a bit the less for his disliking to think of it, for its being, in\r\na complicated situation, a complication the more, and for something\r\nindescribable in Mamie, something at all events straightway lent her by\r\nhis own mind, something that gave her value, gave her intensity and\r\npurpose, as the symbol of an opposition. Little Jeanne wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really at\r\nall in question\xe2\x80\x94how _could_ she be?\xe2\x80\x94yet from the moment Miss Pocock had\r\nshaken her skirts on the platform, touched up the immense bows of her\r\nhat and settled properly over her shoulder the strap of her\r\nmorocco-and-gilt travelling-satchel, from that moment little Jeanne was\r\nopposed.\r\n\r\nIt was in the cab with Jim that impressions really crowded on Strether,\r\ngiving him the strangest sense of length of absence from people among\r\nwhom he had lived for years. Having them thus come out to him was as if\r\nhe had returned to find them: and the droll promptitude of Jim\xe2\x80\x99s mental\r\nreaction threw his own initiation far back into the past. Whoever might\r\nor mightn\xe2\x80\x99t be suited by what was going on among them, Jim, for one,\r\nwould certainly be: his instant recognition\xe2\x80\x94frank and whimsical\xe2\x80\x94of what\r\nthe affair was for _him_ gave Strether a glow of pleasure. \xe2\x80\x9cI say, you\r\nknow, this _is_ about my shape, and if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for _you_\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d so\r\nhe broke out as the charming streets met his healthy appetite; and he\r\nwound up, after an expressive nudge, with a clap of his companion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknee and an \xe2\x80\x9cOh you, you\xe2\x80\x94you _are_ doing it!\xe2\x80\x9d that was charged with\r\nrich meaning. Strether felt in it the intention of homage, but, with a\r\ncuriosity otherwise occupied, postponed taking it up. What he was\r\nasking himself for the time was how Sarah Pocock, in the opportunity\r\nalready given her, had judged her brother\xe2\x80\x94from whom he himself, as they\r\nfinally, at the station, separated for their different conveyances, had\r\nhad a look into which he could read more than one message. However\r\nSarah was judging her brother, Chad\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion about his sister, and\r\nabout her husband and her husband\xe2\x80\x99s sister, was at the least on the way\r\nnot to fail of confidence. Strether felt the confidence, and that, as\r\nthe look between them was an exchange, what he himself gave back was\r\nrelatively vague. This comparison of notes however could wait;\r\neverything struck him as depending on the effect produced by Chad.\r\nNeither Sarah nor Mamie had in any way, at the station\xe2\x80\x94where they had\r\nhad after all ample time\xe2\x80\x94broken out about it; which, to make up for\r\nthis, was what our friend had expected of Jim as soon as they should\r\nfind themselves together.\r\n\r\nIt was queer to him that he had that noiseless brush with Chad; an\r\nironic intelligence with this youth on the subject of his relatives, an\r\nintelligence carried on under their nose and, as might be said, at\r\ntheir expense\xe2\x80\x94such a matter marked again for him strongly the number of\r\nstages he had come; albeit that if the number seemed great the time\r\ntaken for the final one was but the turn of a hand. He had before this\r\nhad many moments of wondering if he himself weren\xe2\x80\x99t perhaps changed\r\neven as Chad was changed. Only what in Chad was conspicuous\r\nimprovement\xe2\x80\x94well, he had no name ready for the working, in his own\r\norganism, of his own more timid dose. He should have to see first what\r\nthis action would amount to. And for his occult passage with the young\r\nman, after all, the directness of it had no greater oddity than the\r\nfact that the young man\xe2\x80\x99s way with the three travellers should have\r\nbeen so happy a manifestation. Strether liked him for it, on the spot,\r\nas he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet liked him; it affected him while it lasted as he might\r\nhave been affected by some light pleasant perfect work of art: to that\r\ndegree that he wondered if they were really worthy of it, took it in\r\nand did it justice; to that degree that it would have been scarce a\r\nmiracle if, there in the luggage-room, while they waited for their\r\nthings, Sarah had pulled his sleeve and drawn him aside. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re right;\r\nwe haven\xe2\x80\x99t quite known what you mean, Mother and I, but now we see.\r\nChad\xe2\x80\x99s magnificent; what can one want more? If _this_ is the kind of\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d On which they might, as it were, have embraced and begun to\r\nwork together.\r\n\r\nAh how much, as it was, for all her bridling brightness\xe2\x80\x94which was\r\nmerely general and noticed nothing\xe2\x80\x94_would_ they work together? Strether\r\nknew he was unreasonable; he set it down to his being nervous: people\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t notice everything and speak of everything in a quarter of an\r\nhour. Possibly, no doubt, also, he made too much of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s display.\r\nYet, none the less, when, at the end of five minutes, in the cab, Jim\r\nPocock had said nothing either\xe2\x80\x94hadn\xe2\x80\x99t said, that is, what Strether\r\nwanted, though he had said much else\xe2\x80\x94it all suddenly bounced back to\r\ntheir being either stupid or wilful. It was more probably on the whole\r\nthe former; so that that would be the drawback of the bridling\r\nbrightness. Yes, they would bridle and be bright; they would make the\r\nbest of what was before them, but their observation would fail; it\r\nwould be beyond them; they simply wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand. Of what use\r\nwould it be then that they had come?\xe2\x80\x94if they weren\xe2\x80\x99t to be intelligent\r\nup to _that_ point: unless indeed he himself were utterly deluded and\r\nextravagant? Was he, on this question of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s improvement, fantastic\r\nand away from the truth? Did he live in a false world, a world that had\r\ngrown simply to suit him, and was his present slight irritation\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\nface now of Jim\xe2\x80\x99s silence in particular\xe2\x80\x94but the alarm of the vain thing\r\nmenaced by the touch of the real? Was this contribution of the real\r\npossibly the mission of the Pococks?\xe2\x80\x94had they come to make the work of\r\nobservation, as _he_ had practised observation, crack and crumble, and\r\nto reduce Chad to the plain terms in which honest minds could deal with\r\nhim? Had they come in short to be sane where Strether was destined to\r\nfeel that he himself had only been silly?\r\n\r\nHe glanced at such a contingency, but it failed to hold him long when\r\nonce he had reflected that he would have been silly, in this case, with\r\nMaria Gostrey and little Bilham, with Madame de Vionnet and little\r\nJeanne, with Lambert Strether, in fine, and above all with Chad Newsome\r\nhimself. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be found to have made more for reality to be silly\r\nwith these persons than sane with Sarah and Jim? Jim in fact, he\r\npresently made up his mind, was individually out of it; Jim didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare; Jim hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come out either for Chad or for him; Jim in short left\r\nthe moral side to Sally and indeed simply availed himself now, for the\r\nsense of recreation, of the fact that he left almost everything to\r\nSally. He was nothing compared to Sally, and not so much by reason of\r\nSally\xe2\x80\x99s temper and will as by that of her more developed type and\r\ngreater acquaintance with the world. He quite frankly and serenely\r\nconfessed, as he sat there with Strether, that he felt his type hang\r\nfar in the rear of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s and still further, if possible, in the\r\nrear of his sister\xe2\x80\x99s. Their types, he well knew, were recognised and\r\nacclaimed; whereas the most a leading Woollett business-man could hope\r\nto achieve socially, and for that matter industrially, was a certain\r\nfreedom to play into this general glamour.\r\n\r\nThe impression he made on our friend was another of the things that\r\nmarked our friend\xe2\x80\x99s road. It was a strange impression, especially as so\r\nsoon produced; Strether had received it, he judged, all in the twenty\r\nminutes; it struck him at least as but in a minor degree the work of\r\nthe long Woollett years. Pocock was normally and consentingly though\r\nnot quite wittingly out of the question. It was despite his being\r\nnormal; it was despite his being cheerful; it was despite his being a\r\nleading Woollett business-man; and the determination of his fate left\r\nhim thus perfectly usual\xe2\x80\x94as everything else about it was clearly, to\r\nhis sense, not less so. He seemed to say that there was a whole side of\r\nlife on which the perfectly usual _was_ for leading Woollett\r\nbusiness-men to be out of the question. He made no more of it than\r\nthat, and Strether, so far as Jim was concerned, desired to make no\r\nmore. Only Strether\xe2\x80\x99s imagination, as always, worked, and he asked\r\nhimself if this side of life were not somehow connected, for those who\r\nfigured on it with the fact of marriage. Would _his_ relation to it,\r\nhad he married ten years before, have become now the same as Pocock\xe2\x80\x99s?\r\nMight it even become the same should he marry in a few months? Should\r\nhe ever know himself as much out of the question for Mrs. Newsome as\r\nJim knew himself\xe2\x80\x94in a dim way\xe2\x80\x94for Mrs. Jim?\r\n\r\nTo turn his eyes in that direction was to be personally reassured; he\r\nwas different from Pocock; he had affirmed himself differently and was\r\nheld after all in higher esteem. What none the less came home to him,\r\nhowever, at this hour, was that the society over there, that of which\r\nSarah and Mamie\xe2\x80\x94and, in a more eminent way, Mrs. Newsome herself\xe2\x80\x94were\r\nspecimens, was essentially a society of women, and that poor Jim wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nin it. He himself Lambert Strether, _was_ as yet in some degree\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nwas an odd situation for a man; but it kept coming back to him in a\r\nwhimsical way that he should perhaps find his marriage had cost him his\r\nplace. This occasion indeed, whatever that fancy represented, was not a\r\ntime of sensible exclusion for Jim, who was in a state of manifest\r\nresponse to the charm of his adventure. Small and fat and constantly\r\nfacetious, straw-coloured and destitute of marks, he would have been\r\npractically indistinguishable hadn\xe2\x80\x99t his constant preference for\r\nlight-grey clothes, for white hats, for very big cigars and very little\r\nstories, done what it could for his identity. There were signs in him,\r\nthough none of them plaintive, of always paying for others; and the\r\nprincipal one perhaps was just this failure of type. It was with this\r\nthat he paid, rather than with fatigue or waste; and also doubtless a\r\nlittle with the effort of humour\xe2\x80\x94never irrelevant to the conditions, to\r\nthe relations, with which he was acquainted.\r\n\r\nHe gurgled his joy as they rolled through the happy streets; he\r\ndeclared that his trip was a regular windfall, and that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthere, he was eager to remark, to hang back from anything: he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow quite what Sally had come for, but _he_ had come for a good time.\r\nStrether indulged him even while wondering if what Sally wanted her\r\nbrother to go back for was to become like her husband. He trusted that\r\na good time was to be, out and out, the programme for all of them; and\r\nhe assented liberally to Jim\xe2\x80\x99s proposal that, disencumbered and\r\nirresponsible\xe2\x80\x94his things were in the omnibus with those of the\r\nothers\xe2\x80\x94they should take a further turn round before going to the hotel.\r\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for _him_ to tackle Chad\xe2\x80\x94it was Sally\xe2\x80\x99s job; and as it would\r\nbe like her, he felt, to open fire on the spot, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be amiss of\r\nthem to hold off and give her time. Strether, on his side, only asked\r\nto give her time; so he jogged with his companion along boulevards and\r\navenues, trying to extract from meagre material some forecast of his\r\ncatastrophe. He was quick enough to see that Jim Pocock declined\r\njudgement, had hovered quite round the outer edge of discussion and\r\nanxiety, leaving all analysis of their question to the ladies alone and\r\nnow only feeling his way toward some small droll cynicism. It broke out\r\nafresh, the cynicism\xe2\x80\x94it had already shown a flicker\xe2\x80\x94in a but slightly\r\ndeferred: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, hanged if I would if _I_ were he!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t in Chad\xe2\x80\x99s place\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive up this to go back and boss the advertising!\xe2\x80\x9d Poor Jim, with his\r\narms folded and his little legs out in the open fiacre, drank in the\r\nsparkling Paris noon and carried his eyes from one side of their vista\r\nto the other. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy I want to come right out and live here myself. And I\r\nwant to live while I _am_ here too. I feel with _you_\xe2\x80\x94oh you\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\ngrand, old man, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve twigged\xe2\x80\x94that it ain\xe2\x80\x99t right to worry Chad. _I_\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mean to persecute him; I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t in conscience. It\xe2\x80\x99s thanks to\r\nyou at any rate that I\xe2\x80\x99m here, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99m much obliged. You\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\nlovely pair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were things in this speech that Strether let pass for the time.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you then think it important the advertising should be thoroughly\r\ntaken in hand? Chad _will_ be, so far as capacity is concerned,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwent on, \xe2\x80\x9cthe man to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did he get his capacity,\xe2\x80\x9d Jim asked, \xe2\x80\x9cover here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t get it over here, and the wonderful thing is that over here\r\nhe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t inevitably lost it. He has a natural turn for business, an\r\nextraordinary head. He comes by that,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether explained, \xe2\x80\x9chonestly\r\nenough. He\xe2\x80\x99s in that respect his father\xe2\x80\x99s son, and also\xe2\x80\x94for she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwonderful in her way too\xe2\x80\x94his mother\xe2\x80\x99s. He has other tastes and other\r\ntendencies; but Mrs. Newsome and your wife are quite right about his\r\nhaving that. He\xe2\x80\x99s very remarkable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I guess he is!\xe2\x80\x9d Jim Pocock comfortably sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbelieved so in his making us hum, why have you so prolonged the\r\ndiscussion? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know we\xe2\x80\x99ve been quite anxious about you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese questions were not informed with earnestness, but Strether saw he\r\nmust none the less make a choice and take a line. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause, you see,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve greatly liked it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve liked my Paris, I dare say I\xe2\x80\x99ve liked it\r\ntoo much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you old wretch!\xe2\x80\x9d Jim gaily exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut nothing\xe2\x80\x99s concluded,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether went on. \xe2\x80\x9cThe case is more complex\r\nthan it looks from Woollett.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh well, it looks bad enough from Woollett!\xe2\x80\x9d Jim declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven after all I\xe2\x80\x99ve written?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim bethought himself. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it what you\xe2\x80\x99ve written that has made Mrs.\r\nNewsome pack us off? That at least and Chad\xe2\x80\x99s not turning up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether made a reflexion of his own. \xe2\x80\x9cI see. That she should do\r\nsomething was, no doubt, inevitable, and your wife has therefore of\r\ncourse come out to act.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d Jim concurred\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto act. But Sally comes out to act, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe lucidly added, \xe2\x80\x9cevery time she leaves the house. She never comes out\r\nbut she _does_ act. She\xe2\x80\x99s acting moreover now for her mother, and that\r\nfixes the scale.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he wound up, opening all his senses to it, with\r\na renewed embrace of pleasant Paris. \xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t all the same at\r\nWoollett got anything like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether continued to consider. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m bound to say for you all that you\r\nstrike me as having arrived in a very mild and reasonable frame of\r\nmind. You don\xe2\x80\x99t show your claws. I felt just now in Mrs. Pocock no\r\nsymptom of that. She isn\xe2\x80\x99t fierce,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m such a nervous\r\nidiot that I thought she might be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh don\xe2\x80\x99t you know her well enough,\xe2\x80\x9d Pocock asked, \xe2\x80\x9cto have noticed\r\nthat she never gives herself away, any more than her mother ever does?\r\nThey ain\xe2\x80\x99t fierce, either of \xe2\x80\x98em; they let you come quite close. They\r\nwear their fur the smooth side out\xe2\x80\x94the warm side in. Do you know what\r\nthey are?\xe2\x80\x9d Jim pursued as he looked about him, giving the question, as\r\nStrether felt, but half his care\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cdo you know what they are? They\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nabout as intense as they can live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and Strether\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence had a positive precipitation; \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nabout as intense as they can live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t lash about and shake the cage,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jim, who seemed\r\npleased with his analogy; \xe2\x80\x9cand it\xe2\x80\x99s at feeding-time that they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nquietest. But they always get there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey do indeed\xe2\x80\x94they always get there!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether replied with a laugh\r\nthat justified his confession of nervousness. He disliked to be talking\r\nsincerely of Mrs. Newsome with Pocock; he could have talked\r\ninsincerely. But there was something he wanted to know, a need created\r\nin him by her recent intermission, by his having given from the first\r\nso much, as now more than ever appeared to him, and got so little. It\r\nwas as if a queer truth in his companion\xe2\x80\x99s metaphor had rolled over him\r\nwith a rush. She _had_ been quiet at feeding-time; she had fed, and\r\nSarah had fed with her, out of the big bowl of all his recent free\r\ncommunication, his vividness and pleasantness, his ingenuity and even\r\nhis eloquence, while the current of her response had steadily run thin.\r\nJim meanwhile however, it was true, slipped characteristically into\r\nshallowness from the moment he ceased to speak out of the experience of\r\na husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut of course Chad has now the advantage of being there before her. If\r\nhe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work that for all it\xe2\x80\x99s worth\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d He sighed with contingent\r\npity at his brother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s possible want of resource. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has worked\r\nit on _you_, pretty well, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d and he asked the next moment if there\r\nwere anything new at the Varieties, which he pronounced in the American\r\nmanner. They talked about the Varieties\xe2\x80\x94Strether confessing to a\r\nknowledge which produced again on Pocock\xe2\x80\x99s part a play of innuendo as\r\nvague as a nursery-rhyme, yet as aggressive as an elbow in his side;\r\nand they finished their drive under the protection of easy themes.\r\nStrether waited to the end, but still in vain, for any show that Jim\r\nhad seen Chad as different; and he could scarce have explained the\r\ndiscouragement he drew from the absence of this testimony. It was what\r\nhe had taken his own stand on, so far as he had taken a stand; and if\r\nthey were all only going to see nothing he had only wasted his time. He\r\ngave his friend till the very last moment, till they had come into\r\nsight of the hotel; and when poor Pocock only continued cheerful and\r\nenvious and funny he fairly grew to dislike him, to feel him\r\nextravagantly common. If they were _all_ going to see nothing!\xe2\x80\x94Strether\r\nknew, as this came back to him, that he was also letting Pocock\r\nrepresent for him what Mrs. Newsome wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see. He went on disliking,\r\nin the light of Jim\xe2\x80\x99s commonness, to talk to him about that lady; yet\r\njust before the cab pulled up he knew the extent of his desire for the\r\nreal word from Woollett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas Mrs. Newsome at all given way\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Given way\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Jim echoed it with the practical derision of his sense\r\nof a long past.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder the strain, I mean, of hope deferred, of disappointment repeated\r\nand thereby intensified.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh is she prostrate, you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he had his categories in hand. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\r\nyes, she\xe2\x80\x99s prostrate\xe2\x80\x94just as Sally is. But they\xe2\x80\x99re never so lively, you\r\nknow, as when they\xe2\x80\x99re prostrate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s prostrate?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether vaguely murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s when they\xe2\x80\x99re prostrate that they most sit up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s sitting up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll night, my boy\xe2\x80\x94for _you!_\xe2\x80\x9d And Jim fetched him, with a vulgar\r\nlittle guffaw, a thrust that gave relief to the picture. But he had got\r\nwhat he wanted. He felt on the spot that this _was_ the real word from\r\nWoollett. \xe2\x80\x9cSo don\xe2\x80\x99t you go home!\xe2\x80\x9d Jim added while he alighted and while\r\nhis friend, letting him profusely pay the cabman, sat on in a momentary\r\nmuse. Strether wondered if that were the real word too.\r\n\r\n\r\n III\r\n\r\nAs the door of Mrs. Pocock\xe2\x80\x99s salon was pushed open for him, the next\r\nday, well before noon, he was reached by a voice with a charming sound\r\nthat made him just falter before crossing the threshold. Madame de\r\nVionnet was already on the field, and this gave the drama a quicker\r\npace than he felt it as yet\xe2\x80\x94though his suspense had increased\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\npower of any act of his own to do. He had spent the previous evening\r\nwith all his old friends together yet he would still have described\r\nhimself as quite in the dark in respect to a forecast of their\r\ninfluence on his situation. It was strange now, none the less, that in\r\nthe light of this unexpected note of her presence he felt Madame de\r\nVionnet a part of that situation as she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even yet been. She was\r\nalone, he found himself assuming, with Sarah, and there was a bearing\r\nin that\xe2\x80\x94somehow beyond his control\xe2\x80\x94on his personal fate. Yet she was\r\nonly saying something quite easy and independent\xe2\x80\x94the thing she had\r\ncome, as a good friend of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s, on purpose to say. \xe2\x80\x9cThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nanything at all\xe2\x80\x94? I should be so delighted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was clear enough, when they were there before him, how she had been\r\nreceived. He saw this, as Sarah got up to greet him, from something\r\nfairly hectic in Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s face. He saw furthermore that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t, as\r\nhad first come to him, alone together; he was at no loss as to the\r\nidentity of the broad high back presented to him in the embrasure of\r\nthe window furthest from the door. Waymarsh, whom he had to-day not yet\r\nseen, whom he only knew to have left the hotel before him, and who had\r\ntaken part, the night previous, on Mrs. Pocock\xe2\x80\x99s kind invitation,\r\nconveyed by Chad, in the entertainment, informal but cordial, promptly\r\noffered by that lady\xe2\x80\x94Waymarsh had anticipated him even as Madame de\r\nVionnet had done, and, with his hands in his pockets and his attitude\r\nunaffected by Strether\xe2\x80\x99s entrance, was looking out, in marked\r\ndetachment, at the Rue de Rivoli. The latter felt it in the air\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nimmense how Waymarsh could mark things\xe2\x80\x94-that he had remained deeply\r\ndissociated from the overture to their hostess that we have recorded on\r\nMadame de Vionnet\xe2\x80\x99s side. He had, conspicuously, tact, besides a stiff\r\ngeneral view; and this was why he had left Mrs. Pocock to struggle\r\nalone. He would outstay the visitor; he would unmistakeably wait; to\r\nwhat had he been doomed for months past but waiting? Therefore she was\r\nto feel that she had him in reserve. What support she drew from this\r\nwas still to be seen, for, although Sarah was vividly bright, she had\r\ngiven herself up for the moment to an ambiguous flushed formalism. She\r\nhad had to reckon more quickly than she expected; but it concerned her\r\nfirst of all to signify that she was not to be taken unawares. Strether\r\narrived precisely in time for her showing it. \xe2\x80\x9cOh you\xe2\x80\x99re too good; but\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I feel quite helpless. I have my brother\xe2\x80\x94and these\r\nAmerican friends. And then you know I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to Paris. I _know_\r\nParis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sally Pocock in a tone that breathed a certain chill on\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but a woman, in this tiresome place where everything\xe2\x80\x99s always\r\nchanging, a woman of good will,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de Vionnet threw off, \xe2\x80\x9ccan\r\nalways help a woman. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you \xe2\x80\x98know\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94but we know perhaps different\r\nthings.\xe2\x80\x9d She too, visibly, wished to make no mistake; but it was a fear\r\nof a different order and more kept out of sight. She smiled in welcome\r\nat Strether; she greeted him more familiarly than Mrs. Pocock; she put\r\nout her hand to him without moving from her place; and it came to him\r\nin the course of a minute and in the oddest way that\xe2\x80\x94yes,\r\npositively\xe2\x80\x94she was giving him over to ruin. She was all kindness and\r\nease, but she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help so giving him; she was exquisite, and her\r\nbeing just as she was poured for Sarah a sudden rush of meaning into\r\nhis own equivocations. How could she know how she was hurting him? She\r\nwanted to show as simple and humble\xe2\x80\x94in the degree compatible with\r\noperative charm; but it was just this that seemed to put him on her\r\nside. She struck him as dressed, as arranged, as prepared infinitely to\r\nconciliate\xe2\x80\x94with the very poetry of good taste in her view of the\r\nconditions of her early call. She was ready to advise about dressmakers\r\nand shops; she held herself wholly at the disposition of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s family.\r\nStrether noticed her card on the table\xe2\x80\x94her coronet and her\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComtesse\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and the imagination was sharp in him of certain private\r\nadjustments in Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s mind. She had never, he was sure, sat with a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComtesse\xe2\x80\x9d before, and such was the specimen of that class he had been\r\nkeeping to play on her. She had crossed the sea very particularly for a\r\nlook at her; but he read in Madame de Vionnet\xe2\x80\x99s own eyes that this\r\ncuriosity hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been so successfully met as that she herself wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nnow have more than ever need of him. She looked much as she had looked\r\nto him that morning at Notre Dame; he noted in fact the suggestive\r\nsameness of her discreet and delicate dress. It seemed to speak\xe2\x80\x94perhaps\r\na little prematurely or too finely\xe2\x80\x94of the sense in which she would help\r\nMrs. Pocock with the shops. The way that lady took her in, moreover,\r\nadded depth to his impression of what Miss Gostrey, by their common\r\nwisdom, had escaped. He winced as he saw himself but for that timely\r\nprudence ushering in Maria as a guide and an example. There was however\r\na touch of relief for him in his glimpse, so far as he had got it, of\r\nSarah\xe2\x80\x99s line. She \xe2\x80\x9cknew Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de Vionnet had, for that matter,\r\nlightly taken this up. \xe2\x80\x9cAh then you\xe2\x80\x99ve a turn for that, an affinity\r\nthat belongs to your family. Your brother, though his long experience\r\nmakes a difference, I admit, has become one of us in a marvellous way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd she appealed to Strether in the manner of a woman who could always\r\nglide off with smoothness into another subject. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t _he_ struck with\r\nthe way Mr. Newsome had made the place his own, and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t he been in a\r\nposition to profit by his friend\xe2\x80\x99s wondrous expertness?\r\n\r\nStrether felt the bravery, at the least, of her presenting herself so\r\npromptly to sound that note, and yet asked himself what other note,\r\nafter all, she _could_ strike from the moment she presented herself at\r\nall. She could meet Mrs. Pocock only on the ground of the obvious, and\r\nwhat feature of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s situation was more eminent than the fact that he\r\nhad created for himself a new set of circumstances? Unless she hid\r\nherself altogether she could show but as one of these, an illustration\r\nof his domiciled and indeed of his confirmed condition. And the\r\nconsciousness of all this in her charming eyes was so clear and fine\r\nthat as she thus publicly drew him into her boat she produced in him\r\nsuch a silent agitation as he was not to fail afterwards to denounce as\r\npusillanimous. \xe2\x80\x9cAh don\xe2\x80\x99t be so charming to me!\xe2\x80\x94for it makes us\r\nintimate, and after all what _is_ between us when I\xe2\x80\x99ve been so\r\ntremendously on my guard and have seen you but half a dozen times?\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nrecognised once more the perverse law that so inveterately governed his\r\npoor personal aspects: it would be exactly _like_ the way things always\r\nturned out for him that he should affect Mrs. Pocock and Waymarsh as\r\nlaunched in a relation in which he had really never been launched at\r\nall. They were at this very moment\xe2\x80\x94they could only be\xe2\x80\x94attributing to\r\nhim the full licence of it, and all by the operation of her own tone\r\nwith him; whereas his sole licence had been to cling with intensity to\r\nthe brink, not to dip so much as a toe into the flood. But the flicker\r\nof his fear on this occasion was not, as may be added, to repeat\r\nitself; it sprang up, for its moment, only to die down and then go out\r\nfor ever. To meet his fellow visitor\xe2\x80\x99s invocation and, with Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrilliant eyes on him, answer, _was_ quite sufficiently to step into\r\nher boat. During the rest of the time her visit lasted he felt himself\r\nproceed to each of the proper offices, successively, for helping to\r\nkeep the adventurous skiff afloat. It rocked beneath him, but he\r\nsettled himself in his place. He took up an oar and, since he was to\r\nhave the credit of pulling, pulled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will make it all the pleasanter if it so happens that we _do_\r\nmeet,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de Vionnet had further observed in reference to Mrs.\r\nPocock\xe2\x80\x99s mention of her initiated state; and she had immediately added\r\nthat, after all, her hostess couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in need with the good offices\r\nof Mr. Strether so close at hand. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s he, I gather, who has learnt to\r\nknow his Paris, and to love it, better than any one ever before in so\r\nshort a time; so that between him and your brother, when it comes to\r\nthe point, how can you possibly want for good guidance? The great\r\nthing, Mr. Strether will show you,\xe2\x80\x9d she smiled, \xe2\x80\x9cis just to let one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nself go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99ve not let myself go very far,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether answered, feeling quite\r\nas if he had been called upon to hint to Mrs. Pocock how Parisians\r\ncould talk. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only afraid of showing I haven\xe2\x80\x99t let myself go far\r\nenough. I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken a good deal of time, but I must quite have had the\r\nair of not budging from one spot.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at Sarah in a manner that\r\nhe thought she might take as engaging, and he made, under Madame de\r\nVionnet\xe2\x80\x99s protection, as it were, his first personal point. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has\r\nreally happened has been that, all the while, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done what I came out\r\nfor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYet it only at first gave Madame de Vionnet a chance immediately to\r\ntake him up. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve renewed acquaintance with your friend\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nlearnt to know him again.\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke with such cheerful helpfulness\r\nthat they might, in a common cause, have been calling together and\r\npledged to mutual aid.\r\n\r\nWaymarsh, at this, as if he had been in question, straightway turned\r\nfrom the window. \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, Countess\xe2\x80\x94he has renewed acquaintance with\r\n_me_, and he _has_, I guess, learnt something about me, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how much he has liked it. It\xe2\x80\x99s for Strether himself to say whether\r\nhe has felt it justifies his course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh but _you_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Countess gaily, \xe2\x80\x9care not in the least what he\r\ncame out for\xe2\x80\x94is he really, Strether? and I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t you at all in my\r\nmind. I was thinking of Mr. Newsome, of whom we think so much and with\r\nwhom, precisely, Mrs. Pocock has given herself the opportunity to take\r\nup threads. What a pleasure for you both!\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de Vionnet, with her\r\neyes on Sarah, bravely continued.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pocock met her handsomely, but Strether quickly saw she meant to\r\naccept no version of her movements or plans from any other lips. She\r\nrequired no patronage and no support, which were but other names for a\r\nfalse position; she would show in her own way what she chose to show,\r\nand this she expressed with a dry glitter that recalled to him a fine\r\nWoollett winter morning. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never wanted for opportunities to see my\r\nbrother. We\xe2\x80\x99ve many things to think of at home, and great\r\nresponsibilities and occupations, and our home\xe2\x80\x99s not an impossible\r\nplace. We\xe2\x80\x99ve plenty of reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d Sarah continued a little piercingly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor everything we do\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and in short she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give herself the least\r\nlittle scrap away. But she added as one who was always bland and who\r\ncould afford a concession: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve come because\xe2\x80\x94well, because we do\r\ncome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh then fortunately!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Madame de Vionnet breathed it to the air. Five\r\nminutes later they were on their feet for her to take leave, standing\r\ntogether in an affability that had succeeded in surviving a further\r\nexchange of remarks; only with the emphasised appearance on Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npart of a tendency to revert, in a ruminating manner and as with an\r\ninstinctive or a precautionary lightening of his tread, to an open\r\nwindow and his point of vantage. The glazed and gilded room, all red\r\ndamask, ormolu, mirrors, clocks, looked south, and the shutters were\r\nbowed upon the summer morning; but the Tuileries garden and what was\r\nbeyond it, over which the whole place hung, were things visible through\r\ngaps; so that the far-spreading presence of Paris came up in coolness,\r\ndimness and invitation, in the twinkle of gilt-tipped palings, the\r\ncrunch of gravel, the click of hoofs, the crack of whips, things that\r\nsuggested some parade of the circus. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it probable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nPocock, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I shall have the opportunity of going to my brother\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt it\xe2\x80\x99s very pleasant indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke as to Strether, but\r\nher face was turned with an intensity of brightness to Madame de\r\nVionnet, and there was a moment during which, while she thus fronted\r\nher, our friend expected to hear her add: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m much obliged to you, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure, for inviting me there.\xe2\x80\x9d He guessed that for five seconds these\r\nwords were on the point of coming; he heard them as clearly as if they\r\nhad been spoken; but he presently knew they had just failed\xe2\x80\x94knew it by\r\na glance, quick and fine, from Madame de Vionnet, which told him that\r\nshe too had felt them in the air, but that the point had luckily not\r\nbeen made in any manner requiring notice. This left her free to reply\r\nonly to what had been said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat the Boulevard Malesherbes may be common ground for us offers me\r\nthe best prospect I see for the pleasure of meeting you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I shall come to see you, since you\xe2\x80\x99ve been so good\xe2\x80\x9d: and Mrs.\r\nPocock looked her invader well in the eyes. The flush in Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks\r\nhad by this time settled to a small definite crimson spot that was not\r\nwithout its own bravery; she held her head a good deal up, and it came\r\nto Strether that of the two, at this moment, she was the one who most\r\ncarried out the idea of a Countess. He quite took in, however, that she\r\nwould really return her visitor\xe2\x80\x99s civility: she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t report again\r\nat Woollett without at least so much producible history as that in her\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want extremely to be able to show you my little daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de\r\nVionnet went on; \xe2\x80\x9cand I should have brought her with me if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwished first to ask your leave. I was in hopes I should perhaps find\r\nMiss Pocock, of whose being with you I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from Mr. Newsome and\r\nwhose acquaintance I should so much like my child to make. If I have\r\nthe pleasure of seeing her and you do permit it I shall venture to ask\r\nher to be kind to Jeanne. Mr. Strether will tell you\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she beautifully\r\nkept it up\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat my poor girl is gentle and good and rather lonely.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ve made friends, he and she, ever so happily, and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, I\r\nbelieve, think ill of her. As for Jeanne herself he has had the same\r\nsuccess with her that I know he has had here wherever he has turned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe seemed to ask him for permission to say these things, or seemed\r\nrather to take it, softly and happily, with the ease of intimacy, for\r\ngranted, and he had quite the consciousness now that not to meet her at\r\nany point more than halfway would be odiously, basely to abandon her.\r\nYes, he was _with_ her, and, opposed even in this covert, this\r\nsemi-safe fashion to those who were not, he felt, strangely and\r\nconfusedly, but excitedly, inspiringly, how much and how far. It was as\r\nif he had positively waited in suspense for something from her that\r\nwould let him in deeper, so that he might show her how he could take\r\nit. And what did in fact come as she drew out a little her farewell\r\nserved sufficiently the purpose. \xe2\x80\x9cAs his success is a matter that I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure he\xe2\x80\x99ll never mention for himself, I feel, you see, the less\r\nscruple; which it\xe2\x80\x99s very good of me to say, you know, by the way,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded as she addressed herself to him; \xe2\x80\x9cconsidering how little direct\r\nadvantage I\xe2\x80\x99ve gained from your triumphs with _me_. When does one ever\r\nsee you? I wait at home and I languish. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have rendered me the\r\nservice, Mrs. Pocock, at least,\xe2\x80\x9d she wound up, \xe2\x80\x9cof giving me one of my\r\nmuch-too-rare glimpses of this gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly should be sorry to deprive you of anything that seems so\r\nmuch, as you describe it, your natural due. Mr. Strether and I are very\r\nold friends,\xe2\x80\x9d Sarah allowed, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the privilege of his society isn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nthing I shall quarrel about with any one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, dear Sarah,\xe2\x80\x9d he freely broke in, \xe2\x80\x9cI feel, when I hear you say\r\nthat, that you don\xe2\x80\x99t quite do justice to the important truth of the\r\nextent to which\xe2\x80\x94as you\xe2\x80\x99re also mine\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m _your_ natural due. I should\r\nlike much better,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cto see you fight for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe met him, Mrs. Pocock, on this, with an arrest of speech\xe2\x80\x94with a\r\ncertain breathlessness, as he immediately fancied, on the score of a\r\nfreedom for which she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite prepared. It had flared up\xe2\x80\x94for all\r\nthe harm he had intended by it\xe2\x80\x94because, confoundedly, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nany more to be afraid about her than he wanted to be afraid about\r\nMadame de Vionnet. He had never, naturally, called her anything but\r\nSarah at home, and though he had perhaps never quite so markedly\r\ninvoked her as his \xe2\x80\x9cdear,\xe2\x80\x9d that was somehow partly because no occasion\r\nhad hitherto laid so effective a trap for it. But something admonished\r\nhim now that it was too late\xe2\x80\x94unless indeed it were possibly too early;\r\nand that he at any rate shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have pleased Mrs. Pocock the more by\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Strether\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured with vagueness, yet with\r\nsharpness, while her crimson spot burned a trifle brighter and he was\r\naware that this must be for the present the limit of her response.\r\nMadame de Vionnet had already, however, come to his aid, and Waymarsh,\r\nas if for further participation, moved again back to them. It was true\r\nthat the aid rendered by Madame de Vionnet was questionable; it was a\r\nsign that, for all one might confess to with her, and for all she might\r\ncomplain of not enjoying, she could still insidiously show how much of\r\nthe material of conversation had accumulated between them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe real truth is, you know, that you sacrifice one without mercy to\r\ndear old Maria. She leaves no room in your life for anybody else. Do\r\nyou know,\xe2\x80\x9d she enquired of Mrs. Pocock, \xe2\x80\x9cabout dear old Maria? The\r\nworst is that Miss Gostrey is really a wonderful woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether answered for her, \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Pocock knows about\r\nMiss Gostrey. Your mother, Sarah, must have told you about her; your\r\nmother knows everything,\xe2\x80\x9d he sturdily pursued. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I cordially admit,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe added with his conscious gaiety of courage, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she\xe2\x80\x99s as wonderful\r\na woman as you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh it isn\xe2\x80\x99t _I_ who \xe2\x80\x98like,\xe2\x80\x99 dear Mr. Strether, anything to do with the\r\nmatter!\xe2\x80\x9d Sarah Pocock promptly protested; \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m by no means sure I\r\nhave\xe2\x80\x94from my mother or from any one else\xe2\x80\x94a notion of whom you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ntalking about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he won\xe2\x80\x99t let you see her, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de Vionnet\r\nsympathetically threw in. \xe2\x80\x9cHe never lets _me_\xe2\x80\x94old friends as we are: I\r\nmean as I am with Maria. He reserves her for his best hours; keeps her\r\nconsummately to himself; only gives us others the crumbs of the feast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Countess, _I\xe2\x80\x99ve_ had some of the crumbs,\xe2\x80\x9d Waymarsh observed with\r\nweight and covering her with his large look; which led her to break in\r\nbefore he could go on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Comment donc_, he shares her with _you?_\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed in droll\r\nstupefaction. \xe2\x80\x9cTake care you don\xe2\x80\x99t have, before you go much further,\r\nrather more of all _ces dames_ than you may know what to do with!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he only continued in his massive way. \xe2\x80\x9cI can post you about the\r\nlady, Mrs. Pocock, so far as you may care to hear. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her quite\r\na number of times, and I was practically present when they made\r\nacquaintance. I\xe2\x80\x99ve kept my eye on her right along, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know as\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s any real harm in her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Harm\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de Vionnet quickly echoed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy she\xe2\x80\x99s the dearest and\r\ncleverest of all the clever and dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you run her pretty close, Countess,\xe2\x80\x9d Waymarsh returned with\r\nspirit; \xe2\x80\x9cthough there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt she\xe2\x80\x99s pretty well up in things. She\r\nknows her way round Europe. Above all there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt she does love\r\nStrether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but we all do that\xe2\x80\x94we all love Strether: it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a merit!\xe2\x80\x9d their\r\nfellow visitor laughed, keeping to her idea with a good conscience at\r\nwhich our friend was aware that he marvelled, though he trusted also\r\nfor it, as he met her exquisitely expressive eyes, to some later light.\r\n\r\nThe prime effect of her tone, however\xe2\x80\x94and it was a truth which his own\r\neyes gave back to her in sad ironic play\xe2\x80\x94could only be to make him feel\r\nthat, to say such things to a man in public, a woman must practically\r\nthink of him as ninety years old. He had turned awkwardly, responsively\r\nred, he knew, at her mention of Maria Gostrey; Sarah Pocock\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence\xe2\x80\x94the particular quality of it\xe2\x80\x94had made this inevitable; and\r\nthen he had grown still redder in proportion as he hated to have shown\r\nanything at all. He felt indeed that he was showing much, as,\r\nuncomfortably and almost in pain, he offered up his redness to\r\nWaymarsh, who, strangely enough, seemed now to be looking at him with a\r\ncertain explanatory yearning. Something deep\xe2\x80\x94something built on their\r\nold old relation\xe2\x80\x94passed, in this complexity, between them; he got the\r\nside-wind of a loyalty that stood behind all actual queer questions.\r\nWaymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s dry bare humour\xe2\x80\x94as it gave itself to be taken\xe2\x80\x94gloomed out to\r\ndemand justice. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you talk of Miss Barrace I\xe2\x80\x99ve _my_ chance\r\ntoo,\xe2\x80\x9d it appeared stiffly to nod, and it granted that it was giving him\r\naway, but struggled to add that it did so only to save him. The sombre\r\nglow stared it at him till it fairly sounded out\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto save you, poor old\r\nman, to save you; to save you in spite of yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet it was somehow\r\njust this communication that showed him to himself as more than ever\r\nlost. Still another result of it was to put before him as never yet\r\nthat between his comrade and the interest represented by Sarah there\r\nwas already a basis. Beyond all question now, yes: Waymarsh had been in\r\noccult relation with Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x94out, out it all came in the very\r\neffort of his face. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling my hand\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he as good as\r\nproclaimed it; \xe2\x80\x9cbut only because this at least I _shall_ have got out\r\nof the damned Old World: that I shall have picked up the pieces into\r\nwhich it has caused you to crumble.\xe2\x80\x9d It was as if in short, after an\r\ninstant, Strether had not only had it from him, but had recognised that\r\nso far as this went the instant had cleared the air. Our friend\r\nunderstood and approved; he had the sense that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t otherwise\r\nspeak of it. This would be all, and it would mark in himself a kind of\r\nintelligent generosity. It was with grim Sarah then\xe2\x80\x94Sarah grim for all\r\nher grace\xe2\x80\x94that Waymarsh had begun at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning to save\r\nhim. Well\xe2\x80\x94if he _could_, poor dear man, with his big bleak kindness!\r\nThe upshot of which crowded perception was that Strether, on his own\r\nside, still showed no more than he absolutely had to. He showed the\r\nleast possible by saying to Mrs. Pocock after an interval much briefer\r\nthan our glance at the picture reflected in him: \xe2\x80\x9cOh it\xe2\x80\x99s as true as\r\nthey please!\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s no Miss Gostrey for any one but me\xe2\x80\x94not the least\r\nlittle peep. I keep her to myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s very good of you to notify me,\xe2\x80\x9d Sarah replied without\r\nlooking at him and thrown for a moment by this discrimination, as the\r\ndirection of her eyes showed, upon a dimly desperate little community\r\nwith Madame de Vionnet. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I hope I shan\xe2\x80\x99t miss her too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Vionnet instantly rallied. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you know\xe2\x80\x94though it might\r\noccur to one\xe2\x80\x94it isn\xe2\x80\x99t in the least that he\xe2\x80\x99s ashamed of her. She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreally\xe2\x80\x94in a way\xe2\x80\x94extremely good-looking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but extremely!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether laughed while he wondered at the odd part\r\nhe found thus imposed on him.\r\n\r\nIt continued to be so by every touch from Madame de Vionnet. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, as\r\nI say, you know, I wish you would keep _me_ a little more to yourself.\r\nCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you name some day for me, some hour\xe2\x80\x94and better soon than late?\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll be at home whenever it best suits you. There\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t say fairer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether thought a moment while Waymarsh and Mrs. Pocock affected him\r\nas standing attentive. \xe2\x80\x9cI did lately call on you. Last week\xe2\x80\x94while Chad\r\nwas out of town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94and I was away, as it happened, too. You choose your moments well.\r\nBut don\xe2\x80\x99t wait for my next absence, for I shan\xe2\x80\x99t make another,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame\r\nde Vionnet declared, \xe2\x80\x9cwhile Mrs. Pocock\xe2\x80\x99s here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat vow needn\xe2\x80\x99t keep you long, fortunately,\xe2\x80\x9d Sarah observed with\r\nreasserted suavity. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be at present but a short time in Paris. I\r\nhave my plans for other countries. I meet a number of charming\r\nfriends\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and her voice seemed to caress that description of these\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh then,\xe2\x80\x9d her visitor cheerfully replied, \xe2\x80\x9call the more reason!\r\nTo-morrow, for instance, or next day?\xe2\x80\x9d she continued to Strether.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTuesday would do for me beautifully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTuesday then with pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd at half-past five?\xe2\x80\x94or at six?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was ridiculous, but Mrs. Pocock and Waymarsh struck him as fairly\r\nwaiting for his answer. It was indeed as if they were arranged,\r\ngathered for a performance, the performance of \xe2\x80\x9cEurope\xe2\x80\x9d by his\r\nconfederate and himself. Well, the performance could only go on. \xe2\x80\x9cSay\r\nfive forty-five.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive forty-five\xe2\x80\x94good.\xe2\x80\x9d And now at last Madame de Vionnet must leave\r\nthem, though it carried, for herself, the performance a little further.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _did_ hope so much also to see Miss Pocock. Mayn\xe2\x80\x99t I still?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSarah hesitated, but she rose equal. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll return your visit with me.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s at present out with Mr. Pocock and my brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see\xe2\x80\x94of course Mr. Newsome has everything to show them. He has told\r\nme so much about her. My great desire\xe2\x80\x99s to give my daughter the\r\nopportunity of making her acquaintance. I\xe2\x80\x99m always on the lookout for\r\nsuch chances for her. If I didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring her to-day it was only to make\r\nsure first that you\xe2\x80\x99d let me.\xe2\x80\x9d After which the charming woman risked a\r\nmore intense appeal. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t suit _you_ also to mention some near\r\ntime, so that we shall be sure not to lose you?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether on his side\r\nwaited, for Sarah likewise had, after all, to perform; and it occupied\r\nhim to have been thus reminded that she had stayed at home\xe2\x80\x94and on her\r\nfirst morning of Paris\xe2\x80\x94while Chad led the others forth. Oh she was up\r\nto her eyes; if she had stayed at home she had stayed by an\r\nunderstanding, arrived at the evening before, that Waymarsh would come\r\nand find her alone. This was beginning well\xe2\x80\x94for a first day in Paris;\r\nand the thing might be amusing yet. But Madame de Vionnet\xe2\x80\x99s earnestness\r\nwas meanwhile beautiful. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may think me indiscreet, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve _such_\r\na desire my Jeanne shall know an American girl of the really delightful\r\nkind. You see I throw myself for it on your charity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe manner of this speech gave Strether such a sense of depths below it\r\nand behind it as he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet had\xe2\x80\x94ministered in a way that almost\r\nfrightened him to his dim divinations of reasons; but if Sarah still,\r\nin spite of it, faltered, this was why he had time for a sign of\r\nsympathy with her petitioner. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me say then, dear lady, to back your\r\nplea, that Miss Mamie is of the most delightful kind of all\xe2\x80\x94is charming\r\namong the charming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven Waymarsh, though with more to produce on the subject, could get\r\ninto motion in time. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Countess, the American girl\xe2\x80\x99s a thing that\r\nyour country must at least allow ours the privilege to say we _can_\r\nshow you. But her full beauty is only for those who know how to make\r\nuse of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh then,\xe2\x80\x9d smiled Madame de Vionnet, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I want to do.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sure she has much to teach us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was wonderful, but what was scarce less so was that Strether found\r\nhimself, by the quick effect of it, moved another way. \xe2\x80\x9cOh that may be!\r\nBut don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of your own exquisite daughter, you know, as if she\r\nweren\xe2\x80\x99t pure perfection. _I_ at least won\xe2\x80\x99t take that from you.\r\nMademoiselle de Vionnet,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, in considerable form, to Mrs.\r\nPocock, \xe2\x80\x9c_is_ pure perfection. Mademoiselle de Vionnet _is_ exquisite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt had been perhaps a little portentous, but \xe2\x80\x9cAh?\xe2\x80\x9d Sarah simply\r\nglittered.\r\n\r\nWaymarsh himself, for that matter, apparently recognised, in respect to\r\nthe facts, the need of a larger justice, and he had with it an\r\ninclination to Sarah. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Jane\xe2\x80\x99s strikingly handsome\xe2\x80\x94in the regular\r\nFrench style.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt somehow made both Strether and Madame de Vionnet laugh out, though\r\nat the very moment he caught in Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, as glancing at the\r\nspeaker, a vague but unmistakeable \xe2\x80\x9cYou too?\xe2\x80\x9d It made Waymarsh in fact\r\nlook consciously over her head. Madame de Vionnet meanwhile, however,\r\nmade her point in her own way. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish indeed I could offer you my poor\r\nchild as a dazzling attraction: it would make one\xe2\x80\x99s position simple\r\nenough! She\xe2\x80\x99s as good as she can be, but of course she\xe2\x80\x99s different, and\r\nthe question is now\xe2\x80\x94in the light of the way things seem to go\xe2\x80\x94if she\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t after all _too_ different: too different I mean from the splendid\r\ntype every one is so agreed that your wonderful country produces. On\r\nthe other hand of course Mr. Newsome, who knows it so well, has, as a\r\ngood friend, dear kind man that he is, done everything he can\xe2\x80\x94to keep\r\nus from fatal benightedness\xe2\x80\x94for my small shy creature. Well,\xe2\x80\x9d she wound\r\nup after Mrs. Pocock had signified, in a murmur still a little stiff,\r\nthat she would speak to her own young charge on the question\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwell, we\r\nshall sit, my child and I, and wait and wait and wait for you.\xe2\x80\x9d But her\r\nlast fine turn was for Strether. \xe2\x80\x9cDo speak of us in such a way\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs that something can\xe2\x80\x99t but come of it? Oh something _shall_ come of\r\nit! I take a great interest!\xe2\x80\x9d he further declared; and in proof of it,\r\nthe next moment, he had gone with her down to her carriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook Ninth\r\n\r\n\r\n I\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe difficulty is,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether said to Madame de Vionnet a couple of\r\ndays later, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I can\xe2\x80\x99t surprise them into the smallest sign of his\r\nnot being the same old Chad they\xe2\x80\x99ve been for the last three years\r\nglowering at across the sea. They simply won\xe2\x80\x99t give any, and as a\r\npolicy, you know\xe2\x80\x94what you call a _parti pris_, a deep game\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npositively remarkable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was so remarkable that our friend had pulled up before his hostess\r\nwith the vision of it; he had risen from his chair at the end of ten\r\nminutes and begun, as a help not to worry, to move about before her\r\nquite as he moved before Maria. He had kept his appointment with her to\r\nthe minute and had been intensely impatient, though divided in truth\r\nbetween the sense of having everything to tell her and the sense of\r\nhaving nothing at all. The short interval had, in the face of their\r\ncomplication, multiplied his impressions\xe2\x80\x94it being meanwhile to be\r\nnoted, moreover, that he already frankly, already almost publicly,\r\nviewed the complication as common to them. If Madame de Vionnet, under\r\nSarah\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, had pulled him into her boat, there was by this time no\r\ndoubt whatever that he had remained in it and that what he had really\r\nmost been conscious of for many hours together was the movement of the\r\nvessel itself. They were in it together this moment as they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet\r\nbeen, and he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t at present uttered the least of the words of alarm\r\nor remonstrance that had died on his lips at the hotel. He had other\r\nthings to say to her than that she had put him in a position; so\r\nquickly had his position grown to affect him as quite excitingly,\r\naltogether richly, inevitable. That the outlook, however\xe2\x80\x94given the\r\npoint of exposure\xe2\x80\x94hadn\xe2\x80\x99t cleared up half so much as he had reckoned was\r\nthe first warning she received from him on his arrival. She had replied\r\nwith indulgence that he was in too great a hurry, and had remarked\r\nsoothingly that if she knew how to be patient surely _he_ might be. He\r\nfelt her presence, on the spot, he felt her tone and everything about\r\nher, as an aid to that effort; and it was perhaps one of the proofs of\r\nher success with him that he seemed so much to take his ease while they\r\ntalked. By the time he had explained to her why his impressions, though\r\nmultiplied, still baffled him, it was as if he had been familiarly\r\ntalking for hours. They baffled him because Sarah\xe2\x80\x94well, Sarah was deep,\r\ndeeper than she had ever yet had a chance to show herself. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay that this was partly the effect of her opening so straight down, as\r\nit were, into her mother, and that, given Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s profundity,\r\nthe shaft thus sunk might well have a reach; but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t without a\r\nresigned apprehension that, at such a rate of confidence between the\r\ntwo women, he was likely soon to be moved to show how already, at\r\nmoments, it had been for him as if he were dealing directly with Mrs.\r\nNewsome. Sarah, to a certainty, would have begun herself to feel it in\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94and this naturally put it in her power to torment him the more.\r\nFrom the moment she knew he _could_ be tormented\xe2\x80\x94!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _why_ can you be?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94his companion was surprised at his use of the\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I\xe2\x80\x99m made so\xe2\x80\x94I think of everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh one must never do that,\xe2\x80\x9d she smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cOne must think of as few\r\nthings as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cone must pick them out right. But all I mean\r\nis\xe2\x80\x94for I express myself with violence\xe2\x80\x94that she\xe2\x80\x99s in a position to watch\r\nme. There\xe2\x80\x99s an element of suspense for me, and she can see me wriggle.\r\nBut my wriggling doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued. \xe2\x80\x9cI can bear it. Besides,\r\nI shall wriggle out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe picture at any rate stirred in her an appreciation that he felt to\r\nbe sincere. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see how a man can be kinder to a woman than you\r\nare to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, kind was what he wanted to be; yet even while her charming eyes\r\nrested on him with the truth of this he none the less had his humour of\r\nhonesty. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I say suspense I mean, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed, \xe2\x80\x9csuspense\r\nabout my own case too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94about your own case too!\xe2\x80\x9d It diminished his magnanimity, but\r\nshe only looked at him the more tenderly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot, however,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I want to talk to you about that.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s my own little affair, and I mentioned it simply as part of Mrs.\r\nPocock\xe2\x80\x99s advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d No, no; though there was a queer present\r\ntemptation in it, and his suspense was so real that to fidget was a\r\nrelief, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to her about Mrs. Newsome, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work off\r\non her the anxiety produced in him by Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s calculated omissions of\r\nreference. The effect she produced of representing her mother had been\r\nproduced\xe2\x80\x94and that was just the immense, the uncanny part of it\xe2\x80\x94without\r\nher having so much as mentioned that lady. She had brought no message,\r\nhad alluded to no question, had only answered his enquiries with\r\nhopeless limited propriety. She had invented a way of meeting them\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nif he had been a polite perfunctory poor relation, of distant\r\ndegree\xe2\x80\x94that made them almost ridiculous in him. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t moreover on\r\nhis own side ask much without appearing to publish how he had lately\r\nlacked news; a circumstance of which it was Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s profound policy not\r\nto betray a suspicion. These things, all the same, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t breathe\r\nto Madame de Vionnet\xe2\x80\x94much as they might make him walk up and down. And\r\nwhat he didn\xe2\x80\x99t say\xe2\x80\x94as well as what _she_ didn\xe2\x80\x99t, for she had also her\r\nhigh decencies\xe2\x80\x94enhanced the effect of his being there with her at the\r\nend of ten minutes more intimately on the basis of saving her than he\r\nhad yet had occasion to be. It ended in fact by being quite beautiful\r\nbetween them, the number of things they had a manifest consciousness of\r\nnot saying. He would have liked to turn her, critically, to the subject\r\nof Mrs. Pocock, but he so stuck to the line he felt to be the point of\r\nhonour and of delicacy that he scarce even asked her what her personal\r\nimpression had been. He knew it, for that matter, without putting her\r\nto trouble: that she wondered how, with such elements, Sarah could\r\nstill have no charm, was one of the principal things she held her\r\ntongue about. Strether would have been interested in her estimate of\r\nthe elements\xe2\x80\x94indubitably there, some of them, and to be appraised\r\naccording to taste\xe2\x80\x94but he denied himself even the luxury of this\r\ndiversion. The way Madame de Vionnet affected him to-day was in itself\r\na kind of demonstration of the happy employment of gifts. How could a\r\nwoman think Sarah had charm who struck one as having arrived at it\r\nherself by such different roads? On the other hand of course Sarah\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t obliged to have it. He felt as if somehow Madame de Vionnet\r\n_was_. The great question meanwhile was what Chad thought of his\r\nsister; which was naturally ushered in by that of Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s apprehension\r\nof Chad. _That_ they could talk of, and with a freedom purchased by\r\ntheir discretion in other senses. The difficulty however was that they\r\nwere reduced as yet to conjecture. He had given them in the day or two\r\nas little of a lead as Sarah, and Madame de Vionnet mentioned that she\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen him since his sister\xe2\x80\x99s arrival.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd does that strike you as such an age?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe met it in all honesty. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I won\xe2\x80\x99t pretend I don\xe2\x80\x99t miss him.\r\nSometimes I see him every day. Our friendship\xe2\x80\x99s like that. Make what\r\nyou will of it!\xe2\x80\x9d she whimsically smiled; a little flicker of the kind,\r\noccasional in her, that had more than once moved him to wonder what he\r\nmight best make of _her_. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly right,\xe2\x80\x9d she hastened to\r\nadd, \xe2\x80\x9cand I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have him fail in any way at present for the world.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d sooner not see him for three months. I begged him to be beautiful\r\nto them, and he fully feels it for himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether turned away under his quick perception; she was so odd a\r\nmixture of lucidity and mystery. She fell in at moments with the theory\r\nabout her he most cherished, and she seemed at others to blow it into\r\nair. She spoke now as if her art were all an innocence, and then again\r\nas if her innocence were all an art. \xe2\x80\x9cOh he\xe2\x80\x99s giving himself up, and\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll do so to the end. How can he but want, now that it\xe2\x80\x99s within\r\nreach, his full impression?\xe2\x80\x94which is much more important, you know,\r\nthan either yours or mine. But he\xe2\x80\x99s just soaking,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether said as he\r\ncame back; \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s going in conscientiously for a saturation. I\xe2\x80\x99m bound\r\nto say he _is_ very good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d she quietly replied, \xe2\x80\x9cto whom do you say it?\xe2\x80\x9d And then more\r\nquietly still: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s capable of anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether more than reaffirmed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOh he\xe2\x80\x99s excellent. I more and more\r\nlike,\xe2\x80\x9d he insisted, \xe2\x80\x9cto see him with them;\xe2\x80\x9d though the oddity of this\r\ntone between them grew sharper for him even while they spoke. It placed\r\nthe young man so before them as the result of her interest and the\r\nproduct of her genius, acknowledged so her part in the phenomenon and\r\nmade the phenomenon so rare, that more than ever yet he might have been\r\non the very point of asking her for some more detailed account of the\r\nwhole business than he had yet received from her. The occasion almost\r\nforced upon him some question as to how she had managed and as to the\r\nappearance such miracles presented from her own singularly close place\r\nof survey. The moment in fact however passed, giving way to more\r\npresent history, and he continued simply to mark his appreciation of\r\nthe happy truth. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a tremendous comfort to feel how one can trust\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d And then again while for a little she said nothing\xe2\x80\x94as if after\r\nall to _her_ trust there might be a special limit: \xe2\x80\x9cI mean for making a\r\ngood show to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she thoughtfully returned\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut if they shut their eyes to it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether for an instant had his own thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWell perhaps that won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmatter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean because he probably\xe2\x80\x94do what they will\xe2\x80\x94won\xe2\x80\x99t like them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh \xe2\x80\x98do what they will\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94! They won\xe2\x80\x99t do much; especially if Sarah\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t more\xe2\x80\x94well, more than one has yet made out\xe2\x80\x94to give.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Vionnet weighed it. \xe2\x80\x9cAh she has all her grace!\xe2\x80\x9d It was a\r\nstatement over which, for a little, they could look at each other\r\nsufficiently straight, and though it produced no protest from Strether\r\nthe effect was somehow as if he had treated it as a joke. \xe2\x80\x9cShe may be\r\npersuasive and caressing with him; she may be eloquent beyond words.\r\nShe may get hold of him,\xe2\x80\x9d she wound up\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwell, as neither you nor I\r\nhave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she _may_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and now Strether smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he has spent all his\r\ntime each day with Jim. He\xe2\x80\x99s still showing Jim round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe visibly wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cThen how about Jim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether took a turn before he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t he given you Jim?\r\nHasn\xe2\x80\x99t he before this \xe2\x80\x98done\xe2\x80\x99 him for you?\xe2\x80\x9d He was a little at a loss.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t he tell you things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and their eyes once more gave and took. \xe2\x80\x9cNot as you\r\ndo. You somehow make me see them\xe2\x80\x94or at least feel them. And I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nasked too much,\xe2\x80\x9d she added; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve of late wanted so not to worry him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh for that, so have I,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with encouraging assent; so that\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nif she had answered everything\xe2\x80\x94they were briefly sociable on it. It\r\nthrew him back on his other thought, with which he took another turn;\r\nstopping again, however, presently with something of a glow. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see\r\nJim\xe2\x80\x99s really immense. I think it will be Jim who\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cGet hold of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94just the other thing. Counteract Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s spell.\xe2\x80\x9d And he showed now,\r\nour friend, how far he had worked it out. \xe2\x80\x9cJim\xe2\x80\x99s intensely cynical.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear Jim!\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de Vionnet vaguely smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, literally\xe2\x80\x94dear Jim! He\xe2\x80\x99s awful. What _he_ wants, heaven forgive\r\nhim, is to help us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she was eager\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chelp _me?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Chad and me in the first place. But he throws you in too, though\r\nwithout as yet seeing you much. Only, so far as he does see you\xe2\x80\x94if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mind\xe2\x80\x94he sees you as awful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Awful\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she wanted it all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA regular bad one\xe2\x80\x94though of course of a tremendously superior kind.\r\nDreadful, delightful, irresistible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh dear Jim! I should like to know him. I _must_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, naturally. But will it do? You may, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether\r\nsuggested, \xe2\x80\x9cdisappoint him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was droll and humble about it. \xe2\x80\x9cI can but try. But my wickedness\r\nthen,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cis my recommendation for him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour wickedness and the charms with which, in such a degree as yours,\r\nhe associates it. He understands, you see, that Chad and I have above\r\nall wanted to have a good time, and his view is simple and sharp.\r\nNothing will persuade him\xe2\x80\x94in the light, that is, of my behaviour\xe2\x80\x94that I\r\nreally didn\xe2\x80\x99t, quite as much as Chad, come over to have one before it\r\nwas too late. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have expected it of me; but men of my age, at\r\nWoollett\xe2\x80\x94and especially the least likely ones\xe2\x80\x94have been noted as liable\r\nto strange outbreaks, belated uncanny clutches at the unusual, the\r\nideal. It\xe2\x80\x99s an effect that a lifetime of Woollett has quite been\r\nobserved as having; and I thus give it to you, in Jim\xe2\x80\x99s view, for what\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s worth. Now his wife and his mother-in-law,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether continued to\r\nexplain, \xe2\x80\x9chave, as in honour bound, no patience with such phenomena,\r\nlate or early\xe2\x80\x94which puts Jim, as against his relatives, on the other\r\nside. Besides,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think he really wants Chad back. If\r\nChad doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll have\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Madame de Vionnet quite apprehended\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmore of the free\r\nhand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Chad\xe2\x80\x99s the bigger man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo he\xe2\x80\x99ll work now, _en dessous_, to keep him quiet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94he won\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x98work\xe2\x80\x99 at all, and he won\xe2\x80\x99t do anything _en dessous_. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvery decent and won\xe2\x80\x99t be a traitor in the camp. But he\xe2\x80\x99ll be amused\r\nwith his own little view of our duplicity, he\xe2\x80\x99ll sniff up what he\r\nsupposes to be Paris from morning till night, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be, as to the\r\nrest, for Chad\xe2\x80\x94well, just what he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe thought it over. \xe2\x80\x9cA warning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe met it almost with glee. \xe2\x80\x9cYou _are_ as wonderful as everybody says!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd then to explain all he meant: \xe2\x80\x9cI drove him about for his first\r\nhour, and do you know what\xe2\x80\x94all beautifully unconscious\xe2\x80\x94he most put\r\nbefore me? Why that something like _that_ is at bottom, as an\r\nimprovement to his present state, as in fact the real redemption of it,\r\nwhat they think it may not be too late to make of our friend.\xe2\x80\x9d With\r\nwhich, as, taking it in, she seemed, in her recurrent alarm, bravely to\r\ngaze at the possibility, he completed his statement. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it _is_ too\r\nlate. Thanks to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt drew from her again one of her indefinite reflexions. \xe2\x80\x9cOh \xe2\x80\x98me\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94after\r\nall!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood before her so exhilarated by his demonstration that he could\r\nfairly be jocular. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything\xe2\x80\x99s comparative. You\xe2\x80\x99re better than\r\n_that_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she could but answer him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9care better than anything.\xe2\x80\x9d But she had\r\nanother thought. \xe2\x80\x9c_Will_ Mrs. Pocock come to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99ll do that. As soon, that is, as my friend Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x94_her_\r\nfriend now\xe2\x80\x94leaves her leisure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe showed an interest. \xe2\x80\x9cIs he so much her friend as that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you see it all at the hotel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she was amused\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98all\xe2\x80\x99 is a good deal to say. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nforget. I lost myself in _her_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were splendid,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether returned\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut \xe2\x80\x98all\xe2\x80\x99 isn\xe2\x80\x99t a good deal to\r\nsay: it\xe2\x80\x99s only a little. Yet it\xe2\x80\x99s charming so far as it goes. She wants\r\na man to herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd hasn\xe2\x80\x99t she got _you?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think she looked at me\xe2\x80\x94or even at you\xe2\x80\x94as if she had?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether\r\neasily dismissed that irony. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery one, you see, must strike her as\r\nhaving somebody. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got Chad\xe2\x80\x94and Chad has got you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she made of it what she could. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ve got Maria.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, he on his side accepted that. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got Maria. And Maria has got\r\nme. So it goes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Mr. Jim\xe2\x80\x94whom has he got?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh he has got\xe2\x80\x94or it\xe2\x80\x99s as _if_ he had\xe2\x80\x94the whole place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut for Mr. Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she recalled\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cisn\xe2\x80\x99t Miss Barrace before any one\r\nelse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Barrace is a _raffin\xc3\xa9e_, and her amusement\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t lose by Mrs. Pocock. It will gain rather\xe2\x80\x94especially if Sarah\r\ntriumphs and she comes in for a view of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow well you know us!\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de Vionnet, at this, frankly sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94it seems to me it\xe2\x80\x99s we that I know. I know Sarah\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s perhaps on\r\nthat ground only that my feet are firm. Waymarsh will take her round\r\nwhile Chad takes Jim\xe2\x80\x94and I shall be, I assure you, delighted for both\r\nof them. Sarah will have had what she requires\xe2\x80\x94she will have paid her\r\ntribute to the ideal; and he will have done about the same. In Paris\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s in the air\xe2\x80\x94so what can one do less? If there\xe2\x80\x99s a point that,\r\nbeyond any other, Sarah wants to make, it\xe2\x80\x99s that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t come out to\r\nbe narrow. We shall feel at least that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cthe quantity we seem likely to \xe2\x80\x98feel\xe2\x80\x99! But what\r\nbecomes, in these conditions, of the girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf Mamie\xe2\x80\x94if we\xe2\x80\x99re all provided? Ah for that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\r\ntrust Chad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be, you mean, all right to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo pay her every attention as soon as he has polished off Jim. He\r\nwants what Jim can give him\xe2\x80\x94and what Jim really won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94though he has had\r\nit all, and more than all, from me. He wants in short his own personal\r\nimpression, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll get it\xe2\x80\x94strong. But as soon as he has got it Mamie\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t suffer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Mamie mustn\xe2\x80\x99t _suffer!_\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de Vionnet soothingly emphasised.\r\n\r\nBut Strether could reassure her. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t fear. As soon as he has done\r\nwith Jim, Jim will fall to me. And then you\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as if in a moment she saw already; yet she still waited. Then\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she really quite charming?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nHe had got up with his last words and gathered in his hat and gloves.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know; I\xe2\x80\x99m watching. I\xe2\x80\x99m studying the case, as it were\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\ndare say I shall be able to tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it a case?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I think so. At any rate I shall see.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut haven\xe2\x80\x99t you known her before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut somehow at home she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a case. She has become\r\none since.\xe2\x80\x9d It was as if he made it out for himself. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has become\r\none here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo very very soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe measured it, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cNot sooner than I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you became one\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery very soon. The day I arrived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer intelligent eyes showed her thought of it. \xe2\x80\x9cAh but the day you\r\narrived you met Maria. Whom has Miss Pocock met?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused again, but he brought it out. \xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t she met Chad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly\xe2\x80\x94but not for the first time. He\xe2\x80\x99s an old friend.\xe2\x80\x9d At which\r\nStrether had a slow amused significant headshake that made her go on:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that for _her_ at least he\xe2\x80\x99s a new person\xe2\x80\x94that she sees him\r\nas different?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe sees him as different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how does she see him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether gave it up. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can one tell how a deep little girl sees a\r\ndeep young man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs every one so deep? Is she too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it strikes me deeper than I thought. But wait a little\xe2\x80\x94between us\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll make it out. You\xe2\x80\x99ll judge for that matter yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Vionnet looked for the moment fairly bent on the chance.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she _will_ come with her?\xe2\x80\x94I mean Mamie with Mrs. Pocock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. Her curiosity, if nothing else, will in any case work that.\r\nBut leave it all to Chad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d wailed Madame de Vionnet, turning away a little wearily, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nthings I leave to Chad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tone of it made him look at her with a kindness that showed his\r\nvision of her suspense. But he fell back on his confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cOh\r\nwell\xe2\x80\x94trust him. Trust him all the way.\xe2\x80\x9d He had indeed no sooner so\r\nspoken than the queer displacement of his point of view appeared again\r\nto come up for him in the very sound, which drew from him a short\r\nlaugh, immediately checked. He became still more advisory. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen they\r\ndo come give them plenty of Miss Jeanne. Let Mamie see her well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked for a moment as if she placed them face to face. \xe2\x80\x9cFor Mamie\r\nto hate her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had another of his corrective headshakes. \xe2\x80\x9cMamie won\xe2\x80\x99t. Trust\r\n_them_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him hard, and then as if it were what she must always\r\ncome back to: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s _you_ I trust. But I was sincere,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cat\r\nthe hotel. I did, I do, want my child\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Strether waited with deference while she appeared to hesitate\r\nas to how to put it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to do what she can for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether for a little met her eyes on it; after which something that\r\nmight have been unexpected to her came from him. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor little duck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot more expected for himself indeed might well have been her echo of\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor little duck! But she immensely wants herself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nsee our friend\xe2\x80\x99s cousin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that what she thinks her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s what we call the young lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thought again; then with a laugh: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, your daughter will help\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd now at last he took leave of her, as he had been intending for five\r\nminutes. But she went part of the way with him, accompanying him out of\r\nthe room and into the next and the next. Her noble old apartment\r\noffered a succession of three, the first two of which indeed, on\r\nentering, smaller than the last, but each with its faded and formal\r\nair, enlarged the office of the antechamber and enriched the sense of\r\napproach. Strether fancied them, liked them, and, passing through them\r\nwith her more slowly now, met a sharp renewal of his original\r\nimpression. He stopped, he looked back; the whole thing made a vista,\r\nwhich he found high melancholy and sweet\xe2\x80\x94full, once more, of dim\r\nhistoric shades, of the faint faraway cannon-roar of the great Empire.\r\nIt was doubtless half the projection of his mind, but his mind was a\r\nthing that, among old waxed parquets, pale shades of pink and green,\r\npseudo-classic candelabra, he had always needfully to reckon with. They\r\ncould easily make him irrelevant. The oddity, the originality, the\r\npoetry\xe2\x80\x94he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to call it\xe2\x80\x94of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s connexion reaffirmed\r\nfor him its romantic side. \xe2\x80\x9cThey ought to see this, you know. They\r\n_must_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Pococks?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she looked about in deprecation; she seemed to see gaps\r\nhe didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamie and Sarah\xe2\x80\x94Mamie in particular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy shabby old place? But _their_ things\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh their things! You were talking of what will do something for you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that it strikes you,\xe2\x80\x9d she broke in, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my poor place may? Oh,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe ruefully mused, \xe2\x80\x9cthat _would_ be desperate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what I wish?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish Mrs. Newsome herself\r\ncould have a look.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stared, missing a little his logic. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would make a difference?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer tone was so earnest that as he continued to look about he laughed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ve told her, you tell me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll about you? Yes, a wonderful story. But there\xe2\x80\x99s all the\r\nindescribable\xe2\x80\x94what one gets only on the spot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you!\xe2\x80\x9d she charmingly and sadly smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all about me here,\xe2\x80\x9d he freely continued. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Newsome feels\r\nthings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she seemed doomed always to come back to doubt. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one feels so\r\nmuch as _you_. No\xe2\x80\x94not any one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the worse then for every one. It\xe2\x80\x99s very easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were by this time in the antechamber, still alone together, as she\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t rung for a servant. The antechamber was high and square, grave\r\nand suggestive too, a little cold and slippery even in summer, and with\r\na few old prints that were precious, Strether divined, on the walls. He\r\nstood in the middle, slightly lingering, vaguely directing his glasses,\r\nwhile, leaning against the door-post of the room, she gently pressed\r\nher cheek to the side of the recess. \xe2\x80\x9c_You_ would have been a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it startled him a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the reason you say. You\xe2\x80\x99re not stupid.\xe2\x80\x9d And then abruptly, as if\r\nbringing it out were somehow founded on that fact: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re marrying\r\nJeanne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt affected him on the spot as a move in a game, and he was even then\r\nnot without the sense that that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the way Jeanne should be\r\nmarried. But he quickly showed his interest, though\xe2\x80\x94as quickly\r\nafterwards struck him\xe2\x80\x94with an absurd confusion of mind. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99? You\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94not Chad?\xe2\x80\x9d Of course it was the child\xe2\x80\x99s father who made the \xe2\x80\x98we,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbut to the child\xe2\x80\x99s father it would have cost him an effort to allude.\r\nYet didn\xe2\x80\x99t it seem the next minute that Monsieur de Vionnet was after\r\nall not in question?\xe2\x80\x94since she had gone on to say that it was indeed to\r\nChad she referred and that he had been in the whole matter kindness\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I must tell you all, it is he himself who has put us in the way. I\r\nmean in the way of an opportunity that, so far as I can yet see, is all\r\nI could possibly have dreamed of. For all the trouble Monsieur de\r\nVionnet will ever take!\xe2\x80\x9d It was the first time she had spoken to him of\r\nher husband, and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have expressed how much more intimate with\r\nher it suddenly made him feel. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much, in truth\xe2\x80\x94there were\r\nother things in what she was saying that were far more; but it was as\r\nif, while they stood there together so easily in these cold chambers of\r\nthe past, the single touch had shown the reach of her confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nour friend,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9chasn\xe2\x80\x99t then told you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has told me nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it has come with rather a rush\xe2\x80\x94all in a very few days; and\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t moreover yet taken a form that permits an announcement. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonly for you\xe2\x80\x94absolutely you alone\xe2\x80\x94that I speak; I so want you to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe sense he had so often had, since the first hour of his\r\ndisembarkment, of being further and further \xe2\x80\x9cin,\xe2\x80\x9d treated him again at\r\nthis moment to another twinge; but in this wonderful way of her putting\r\nhim in there continued to be something exquisitely remorseless.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur de Vionnet will accept what he _must_ accept. He has proposed\r\nhalf a dozen things\xe2\x80\x94each one more impossible than the other; and he\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have found this if he lives to a hundred. Chad found it,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued with her lighted, faintly flushed, her conscious confidential\r\nface, \xe2\x80\x9cin the quietest way in the world. Or rather it found _him_\xe2\x80\x94for\r\neverything finds him; I mean finds him right. You\xe2\x80\x99ll think we do such\r\nthings strangely\xe2\x80\x94but at my age,\xe2\x80\x9d she smiled, \xe2\x80\x9cone has to accept one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconditions. Our young man\xe2\x80\x99s people had seen her; one of his sisters, a\r\ncharming woman\xe2\x80\x94we know all about them\xe2\x80\x94had observed her somewhere with\r\nme. She had spoken to her brother\xe2\x80\x94turned him on; and we were again\r\nobserved, poor Jeanne and I, without our in the least knowing it. It\r\nwas at the beginning of the winter; it went on for some time; it\r\noutlasted our absence; it began again on our return; and it luckily\r\nseems all right. The young man had met Chad, and he got a friend to\r\napproach him\xe2\x80\x94as having a decent interest in us. Mr. Newsome looked well\r\nbefore he leaped; he kept beautifully quiet and satisfied himself\r\nfully; then only he spoke. It\xe2\x80\x99s what has for some time past occupied\r\nus. It seems as if it were what would do; really, really all one could\r\nwish. There are only two or three points to be settled\xe2\x80\x94they depend on\r\nher father. But this time I think we\xe2\x80\x99re safe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether, consciously gaping a little, had fairly hung upon her lips.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so with all my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d And then he permitted himself: \xe2\x80\x9cDoes\r\nnothing depend on _her?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh naturally; everything did. But she\xe2\x80\x99s pleased _comme tout_. She has\r\nbeen perfectly free; and he\xe2\x80\x94our young friend\xe2\x80\x94is really a combination. I\r\nquite adore him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether just made sure. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean your future son-in-law?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFuture if we all bring it off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether decorously, \xe2\x80\x9cI heartily hope you may.\xe2\x80\x9d There\r\nseemed little else for him to say, though her communication had the\r\noddest effect on him. Vaguely and confusedly he was troubled by it;\r\nfeeling as if he had even himself been concerned in something deep and\r\ndim. He had allowed for depths, but these were greater: and it was as\r\nif, oppressively\xe2\x80\x94indeed absurdly\xe2\x80\x94he was responsible for what they had\r\nnow thrown up to the surface. It was\xe2\x80\x94through something ancient and cold\r\nin it\xe2\x80\x94what he would have called the real thing. In short his hostess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnews, though he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have explained why, was a sensible shock, and\r\nhis oppression a weight he felt he must somehow or other immediately\r\nget rid of. There were too many connexions missing to make it tolerable\r\nhe should do anything else. He was prepared to suffer\xe2\x80\x94before his own\r\ninner tribunal\xe2\x80\x94for Chad; he was prepared to suffer even for Madame de\r\nVionnet. But he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t prepared to suffer for the little girl. So now\r\nhaving said the proper thing, he wanted to get away. She held him an\r\ninstant, however, with another appeal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I seem to you very awful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAwful? Why so?\xe2\x80\x9d But he called it to himself, even as he spoke, his\r\nbiggest insincerity yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur arrangements are so different from yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine?\xe2\x80\x9d Oh he could dismiss that too! \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t any arrangements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you must accept mine; all the more that they\xe2\x80\x99re excellent.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re founded on a _vieille sagesse_. There will be much more, if all\r\ngoes well, for you to hear and to know, and everything, believe me, for\r\nyou to like. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid; you\xe2\x80\x99ll be satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus she could talk\r\nto him of what, of her innermost life\xe2\x80\x94for that was what it came to\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nmust \xe2\x80\x9caccept\xe2\x80\x9d; thus she could extraordinarily speak as if in such an\r\naffair his being satisfied had an importance. It was all a wonder and\r\nmade the whole case larger. He had struck himself at the hotel, before\r\nSarah and Waymarsh, as being in her boat; but where on earth was he\r\nnow? This question was in the air till her own lips quenched it with\r\nanother. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you suppose _he_\xe2\x80\x94who loves her so\xe2\x80\x94would do anything\r\nreckless or cruel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wondered what he supposed. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean your young man\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean yours. I mean Mr. Newsome.\xe2\x80\x9d It flashed for Strether the next\r\nmoment a finer light, and the light deepened as she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cHe takes,\r\nthank God, the truest tenderest interest in her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt deepened indeed. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were talking,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cabout one\xe2\x80\x99s trusting him. You see then\r\nhow I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited a moment\xe2\x80\x94it all came. \xe2\x80\x9cI see\xe2\x80\x94I see.\xe2\x80\x9d He felt he really did\r\nsee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt her for the world, nor\xe2\x80\x94assuming she marries at\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94risk anything that might make against her happiness. And\xe2\x80\x94willingly,\r\nat least\xe2\x80\x94he would never hurt _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer face, with what he had by this time grasped, told him more than her\r\nwords; whether something had come into it, or whether he only read\r\nclearer, her whole story\xe2\x80\x94what at least he then took for such\xe2\x80\x94reached\r\nout to him from it. With the initiative she now attributed to Chad it\r\nall made a sense, and this sense\xe2\x80\x94a light, a lead, was what had abruptly\r\nrisen before him. He wanted, once more, to get off with these things;\r\nwhich was at last made easy, a servant having, for his assistance, on\r\nhearing voices in the hall, just come forward. All that Strether had\r\nmade out was, while the man opened the door and impersonally waited,\r\nsummed up in his last word. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think, you know, Chad will tell me\r\nanything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94perhaps not yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I won\xe2\x80\x99t as yet speak to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh that\xe2\x80\x99s as you\xe2\x80\x99ll think best. You must judge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had finally given him her hand, which he held a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cHow _much_\r\nI have to judge!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Vionnet: a remark that was indeed\xe2\x80\x94with the\r\nrefined disguised suppressed passion of her face\xe2\x80\x94what he most carried\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\r\n II\r\n\r\nSo far as a direct approach was concerned Sarah had neglected him, for\r\nthe week now about to end, with a civil consistency of chill that,\r\ngiving him a higher idea of her social resource, threw him back on the\r\ngeneral reflexion that a woman could always be amazing. It indeed\r\nhelped a little to console him that he felt sure she had for the same\r\nperiod also left Chad\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity hanging; though on the other hand,\r\nfor his personal relief, Chad could at least go through the various\r\nmotions\xe2\x80\x94and he made them extraordinarily numerous\xe2\x80\x94of seeing she had a\r\ngood time. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a motion on which, in her presence, poor\r\nStrether could so much as venture, and all he could do when he was out\r\nof it was to walk over for a talk with Maria. He walked over of course\r\nmuch less than usual, but he found a special compensation in a certain\r\nhalf-hour during which, toward the close of a crowded empty expensive\r\nday, his several companions seemed to him so disposed of as to give his\r\nforms and usages a rest. He had been with them in the morning and had\r\nnevertheless called on the Pococks in the afternoon; but their whole\r\ngroup, he then found, had dispersed after a fashion of which it would\r\namuse Miss Gostrey to hear. He was sorry again, gratefully sorry she\r\nwas so out of it\xe2\x80\x94she who had really put him in; but she had fortunately\r\nalways her appetite for news. The pure flame of the disinterested\r\nburned in her cave of treasures as a lamp in a Byzantine vault. It was\r\njust now, as happened, that for so fine a sense as hers a near view\r\nwould have begun to pay. Within three days, precisely, the situation on\r\nwhich he was to report had shown signs of an equilibrium; the effect of\r\nhis look in at the hotel was to confirm this appearance. If the\r\nequilibrium might only prevail! Sarah was out with Waymarsh, Mamie was\r\nout with Chad, and Jim was out alone. Later on indeed he himself was\r\nbooked to Jim, was to take him that evening to the Varieties\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nStrether was careful to pronounce as Jim pronounced them.\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey drank it in. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat then to-night do the others do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it has been arranged. Waymarsh takes Sarah to dine at Bignon\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do they do after? They can\xe2\x80\x99t come straight\r\nhome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they can\xe2\x80\x99t come straight home\xe2\x80\x94at least Sarah can\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s their\r\nsecret, but I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve guessed it.\xe2\x80\x9d Then as she waited: \xe2\x80\x9cThe circus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt made her stare a moment longer, then laugh almost to extravagance.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no one like you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike _me?_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he only wanted to understand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike all of you together\xe2\x80\x94like all of us: Woollett, Milrose and their\r\nproducts. We\xe2\x80\x99re abysmal\xe2\x80\x94but may we never be less so! Mr. Newsome,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cmeanwhile takes Miss Pocock\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely\xe2\x80\x94to the Fran\xc3\xa7ais: to see what _you_ took Waymarsh and me to,\r\na family-bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh then may Mr. Chad enjoy it as _I_ did!\xe2\x80\x9d But she saw so much in\r\nthings. \xe2\x80\x9cDo they spend their evenings, your young people, like that,\r\nalone together?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they\xe2\x80\x99re young people\xe2\x80\x94but they\xe2\x80\x99re old friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see, I see. And do _they_ dine\xe2\x80\x94for a difference\xe2\x80\x94at Br\xc3\xa9bant\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh where they dine is their secret too. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve my idea that it will\r\nbe, very quietly, at Chad\xe2\x80\x99s own place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll come to him there alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has known her from a child.\r\nBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether with emphasis, \xe2\x80\x9cMamie\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable. She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsplendid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean she expects to bring it off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGetting hold of him? No\xe2\x80\x94I think not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want him enough?\xe2\x80\x94or doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in her power?\xe2\x80\x9d On\r\nwhich as he said nothing she continued: \xe2\x80\x9cShe finds she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care for\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I think she finds she does. But that\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean by so describing\r\nher. It\xe2\x80\x99s _if_ she does that she\xe2\x80\x99s splendid. But we\xe2\x80\x99ll see,\xe2\x80\x9d he wound\r\nup, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere she comes out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to show me sufficiently,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Gostrey laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere she\r\ngoes in! But is her childhood\xe2\x80\x99s friend,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cpermitting himself\r\nrecklessly to flirt with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94not that. Chad\xe2\x80\x99s also splendid. They\xe2\x80\x99re _all_ splendid!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ndeclared with a sudden strange sound of wistfulness and envy. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nat least _happy_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappy?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it appeared, with their various difficulties, to surprise her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94I seem to myself among them the only one who isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe demurred. \xe2\x80\x9cWith your constant tribute to the ideal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had a laugh at his tribute to the ideal, but he explained after a\r\nmoment his impression. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean they\xe2\x80\x99re living. They\xe2\x80\x99re rushing about.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve already had my rushing. I\xe2\x80\x99m waiting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut aren\xe2\x80\x99t you,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked by way of cheer, \xe2\x80\x9cwaiting with _me?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her in all kindness. \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you help me to wait,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nreally something for you that will help you to wait and which you shall\r\nhave in a minute. Only there\xe2\x80\x99s something more I want from you first. I\r\nrevel in Sarah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I. If it weren\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he again amusedly sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cfor _that_\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you owe more to women than any man I ever saw. We do seem to\r\nkeep you going. Yet Sarah, as I see her, must be great.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe _is_\xe2\x80\x9d Strether fully assented: \xe2\x80\x9cgreat! Whatever happens, she\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t, with these unforgettable days, have lived in vain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey had a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean she has fallen in love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean she wonders if she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94and it serves all her purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d Maria laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cserved women\xe2\x80\x99s purposes before!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94for giving in. But I doubt if the idea\xe2\x80\x94as an idea\xe2\x80\x94has ever up to\r\nnow answered so well for holding out. That\xe2\x80\x99s _her_ tribute to the\r\nideal\xe2\x80\x94we each have our own. It\xe2\x80\x99s her romance\xe2\x80\x94and it seems to me better\r\non the whole than mine. To have it in Paris too,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9con this\r\nclassic ground, in this charged infectious air, with so sudden an\r\nintensity: well, it\xe2\x80\x99s more than she expected. She has had in short to\r\nrecognise the breaking out for her of a real affinity\xe2\x80\x94and with\r\neverything to enhance the drama.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey followed. \xe2\x80\x9cJim for instance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJim. Jim hugely enhances. Jim was made to enhance. And then Mr.\r\nWaymarsh. It\xe2\x80\x99s the crowning touch\xe2\x80\x94it supplies the colour. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npositively separated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she herself unfortunately isn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94that supplies the colour too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMiss Gostrey was all there. But somehow\xe2\x80\x94! \xe2\x80\x9cIs _he_ in love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether looked at her a long time; then looked all about the room;\r\nthen came a little nearer. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you never tell any one in the world as\r\nlong as ever you live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever.\xe2\x80\x9d It was charming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe thinks Sarah really is. But he has no fear,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether hastened to\r\nadd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf her being affected by it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf _his_ being. He likes it, but he knows she can hold out. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhelping her, he\xe2\x80\x99s floating her over, by kindness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaria rather funnily considered it. \xe2\x80\x9cFloating her over in champagne?\r\nThe kindness of dining her, nose to nose, at the hour when all Paris is\r\ncrowding to profane delights, and in the\xe2\x80\x94well, in the great temple, as\r\none hears of it, of pleasure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just _it_, for both of them,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether insisted\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand all of a\r\nsupreme innocence. The Parisian place, the feverish hour, the putting\r\nbefore her of a hundred francs\xe2\x80\x99 worth of food and drink, which they\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nscarcely touch\xe2\x80\x94all that\xe2\x80\x99s the dear man\xe2\x80\x99s own romance; the expensive\r\nkind, expensive in francs and centimes, in which he abounds. And the\r\ncircus afterwards\xe2\x80\x94which is cheaper, but which he\xe2\x80\x99ll find some means of\r\nmaking as dear as possible\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s also _his_ tribute to the ideal. It\r\ndoes for him. He\xe2\x80\x99ll see her through. They won\xe2\x80\x99t talk of anything worse\r\nthan you and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99re bad enough perhaps, thank heaven,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cto upset\r\nthem! Mr. Waymarsh at any rate is a hideous old coquette.\xe2\x80\x9d And the next\r\nmoment she had dropped everything for a different pursuit. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t appear to know is that Jeanne de Vionnet has become engaged.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s to marry\xe2\x80\x94it has been definitely arranged\xe2\x80\x94young Monsieur de\r\nMontbron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe fairly blushed. \xe2\x80\x9cThen\xe2\x80\x94if you know it\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98out\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t I often know things that are _not_ out? However,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthis will be out to-morrow. But I see I\xe2\x80\x99ve counted too much on your\r\npossible ignorance. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been before me, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t make you jump as\r\nI hoped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave a gasp at her insight. \xe2\x80\x9cYou never fail! I\xe2\x80\x99ve _had_ my jump. I\r\nhad it when I first heard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen if you knew why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me as soon as you came in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I had it from her as a thing not yet to be spoken of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom Madame de Vionnet herself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a probability\xe2\x80\x94not quite a certainty: a good cause in which Chad has\r\nbeen working. So I\xe2\x80\x99ve waited.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need wait no longer,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned. \xe2\x80\x9cIt reached me\r\nyesterday\xe2\x80\x94roundabout and accidental, but by a person who had had it\r\nfrom one of the young man\xe2\x80\x99s own people\xe2\x80\x94as a thing quite settled. I was\r\nonly keeping it for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou thought Chad wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have told me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t. And yet the thing appears to have been practically his\r\ndoing. So there we are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere we are!\xe2\x80\x9d Maria candidly echoed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why I jumped. I jumped,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued to explain, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it\r\nmeans, this disposition of the daughter, that there\xe2\x80\x99s now nothing else:\r\nnothing else but him and the mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill\xe2\x80\x94it simplifies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt simplifies\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he fully concurred. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s precisely where we are.\r\nIt marks a stage in his relation. The act is his answer to Mrs.\r\nNewsome\xe2\x80\x99s demonstration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt tells,\xe2\x80\x9d Maria asked, \xe2\x80\x9cthe worst?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe worst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is the worst what he wants Sarah to know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care for Sarah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt which Miss Gostrey\xe2\x80\x99s eyebrows went up. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean she has already\r\ndished herself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether took a turn about; he had thought it out again and again\r\nbefore this, to the end; but the vista seemed each time longer. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nwants his good friend to know the best. I mean the measure of his\r\nattachment. She asked for a sign, and he thought of that one. There it\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA concession to her jealousy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether pulled up. \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94call it that. Make it lurid\xe2\x80\x94for that makes my\r\nproblem richer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, let us have it lurid\xe2\x80\x94for I quite agree with you that we\r\nwant none of our problems poor. But let us also have it clear. Can he,\r\nin the midst of such a preoccupation, or on the heels of it, have\r\nseriously cared for Jeanne?\xe2\x80\x94cared, I mean, as a young man at liberty\r\nwould have cared?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, Strether had mastered it. \xe2\x80\x9cI think he can have thought it would\r\nbe charming if he _could_ care. It would be nicer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNicer than being tied up to Marie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94than the discomfort of an attachment to a person he can never\r\nhope, short of a catastrophe, to marry. And he was quite right,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nStrether. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would certainly have been nicer. Even when a thing\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nalready nice there mostly _is_ some other thing that would have been\r\nnicer\xe2\x80\x94or as to which we wonder if it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. But his question was all\r\nthe same a dream. He _couldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ care in that way. He _is_ tied up to\r\nMarie. The relation is too special and has gone too far. It\xe2\x80\x99s the very\r\nbasis, and his recent lively contribution toward establishing Jeanne in\r\nlife has been his definite and final acknowledgement to Madame de\r\nVionnet that he has ceased squirming. I doubt meanwhile,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif Sarah has at all directly attacked him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion brooded. \xe2\x80\x9cBut won\xe2\x80\x99t he wish for his own satisfaction to\r\nmake his ground good to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to me, he\xe2\x80\x99ll leave everything to me. I \xe2\x80\x98sort of\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfeel\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he worked it out\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat the whole thing will come upon me. Yes, I\r\nshall have every inch and every ounce of it. I shall be _used_ for\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d And Strether lost himself in the prospect. Then he fancifully\r\nexpressed the issue. \xe2\x80\x9cTo the last drop of my blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaria, however, roundly protested. \xe2\x80\x9cAh you\xe2\x80\x99ll please keep a drop for\r\n_me_. I shall have a use for it!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which she didn\xe2\x80\x99t however follow up.\r\nShe had come back the next moment to another matter. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Pocock, with\r\nher brother, is trusting only to her general charm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it would seem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the charm\xe2\x80\x99s not working?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, Strether put it otherwise, \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s sounding the note of home\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nis the very best thing she can do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe best for Madame de Vionnet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe best for home itself. The natural one; the right one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight,\xe2\x80\x9d Maria asked, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it fails?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether had a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cThe difficulty\xe2\x80\x99s Jim. Jim\xe2\x80\x99s the note of home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe debated. \xe2\x80\x9cAh surely not the note of Mrs. Newsome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he had it all. \xe2\x80\x9cThe note of the home for which Mrs. Newsome wants\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94the home of the business. Jim stands, with his little legs apart,\r\nat the door of _that_ tent; and Jim _is_, frankly speaking, extremely\r\nawful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaria stared. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you in, you poor thing, for your evening with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh he\xe2\x80\x99s all right for _me!_\xe2\x80\x9d Strether laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cAny one\xe2\x80\x99s good enough\r\nfor _me_. But Sarah shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, all the same, have brought him. She\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend was amused with this statement of it. \xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t know, you\r\nmean, how bad he is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether shook his head with decision. \xe2\x80\x9cNot really.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cThen doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Mrs. Newsome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt made him frankly do the same. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, no\xe2\x80\x94since you ask me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaria rubbed it in. \xe2\x80\x9cNot really either?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. She rates him rather high.\xe2\x80\x9d With which indeed,\r\nimmediately, he took himself up. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, he _is_ good too, in his way.\r\nIt depends on what you want him for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey, however, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let it depend on anything\xe2\x80\x94wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nit, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want him, at any price. \xe2\x80\x9cIt suits my book,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat he should be impossible; and it suits it still better,\xe2\x80\x9d she more\r\nimaginatively added, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Mrs. Newsome doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether, in consequence, had to take it from her, but he fell back on\r\nsomething else. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you who does really know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Waymarsh? Never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever indeed. I\xe2\x80\x99m not _always_ thinking of Mr. Waymarsh; in fact I\r\nfind now I never am.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he mentioned the person as if there were a\r\ngood deal in it. \xe2\x80\x9cMamie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis own sister?\xe2\x80\x9d Oddly enough it but let her down. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat good will\r\nthat do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone perhaps. But there\xe2\x80\x94as usual\xe2\x80\x94we are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n III\r\n\r\nThere they were yet again, accordingly, for two days more; when\r\nStrether, on being, at Mrs. Pocock\xe2\x80\x99s hotel, ushered into that lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsalon, found himself at first assuming a mistake on the part of the\r\nservant who had introduced him and retired. The occupants hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come\r\nin, for the room looked empty as only a room can look in Paris, of a\r\nfine afternoon when the faint murmur of the huge collective life,\r\ncarried on out of doors, strays among scattered objects even as a\r\nsummer air idles in a lonely garden. Our friend looked about and\r\nhesitated; observed, on the evidence of a table charged with purchases\r\nand other matters, that Sarah had become possessed\xe2\x80\x94by no aid from\r\n_him_\xe2\x80\x94of the last number of the salmon-coloured Revue; noted further\r\nthat Mamie appeared to have received a present of Fromentin\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cMa\xc3\xaetres\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Autrefois\xe2\x80\x9d from Chad, who had written her name on the cover; and\r\npulled up at the sight of a heavy letter addressed in a hand he knew.\r\nThis letter, forwarded by a banker and arriving in Mrs. Pocock\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabsence, had been placed in evidence, and it drew from the fact of its\r\nbeing unopened a sudden queer power to intensify the reach of its\r\nauthor. It brought home to him the scale on which Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x94for she\r\nhad been copious indeed this time\xe2\x80\x94was writing to her daughter while she\r\nkept _him_ in durance; and it had altogether such an effect upon him as\r\nmade him for a few minutes stand still and breathe low. In his own\r\nroom, at his own hotel, he had dozens of well-filled envelopes\r\nsuperscribed in that character; and there was actually something in the\r\nrenewal of his interrupted vision of the character that played straight\r\ninto the so frequent question of whether he weren\xe2\x80\x99t already\r\ndisinherited beyond appeal. It was such an assurance as the sharp\r\ndownstrokes of her pen hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet had occasion to give him; but they\r\nsomehow at the present crisis stood for a probable absoluteness in any\r\ndecree of the writer. He looked at Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s name and address, in short,\r\nas if he had been looking hard into her mother\xe2\x80\x99s face, and then turned\r\nfrom it as if the face had declined to relax. But since it was in a\r\nmanner as if Mrs. Newsome were thereby all the more, instead of the\r\nless, in the room, and were conscious, sharply and sorely conscious, of\r\nhimself, so he felt both held and hushed, summoned to stay at least and\r\ntake his punishment. By staying, accordingly, he took it\xe2\x80\x94creeping\r\nsoftly and vaguely about and waiting for Sarah to come in. She _would_\r\ncome in if he stayed long enough, and he had now more than ever the\r\nsense of her success in leaving him a prey to anxiety. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to be\r\ndenied that she had had a happy instinct, from the point of view of\r\nWoollett, in placing him thus at the mercy of her own initiative. It\r\nwas very well to try to say he didn\xe2\x80\x99t care\xe2\x80\x94that she might break ground\r\nwhen she would, might never break it at all if she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, and that\r\nhe had no confession whatever to wait upon her with: he breathed from\r\nday to day an air that damnably required clearing, and there were\r\nmoments when he quite ached to precipitate that process. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndoubt that, should she only oblige him by surprising him just as he\r\nthen was, a clarifying scene of some sort would result from the\r\nconcussion.\r\n\r\nHe humbly circulated in this spirit till he suddenly had a fresh\r\narrest. Both the windows of the room stood open to the balcony, but it\r\nwas only now that, in the glass of the leaf of one of them, folded\r\nback, he caught a reflexion quickly recognised as the colour of a\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s dress. Somebody had been then all the while on the balcony, and\r\nthe person, whoever it might be, was so placed between the windows as\r\nto be hidden from him; while on the other hand the many sounds of the\r\nstreet had covered his own entrance and movements. If the person were\r\nSarah he might on the spot therefore be served to his taste. He might\r\nlead her by a move or two up to the remedy for his vain tension; as to\r\nwhich, should he get nothing else from it, he would at least have the\r\nrelief of pulling down the roof on their heads. There was fortunately\r\nno one at hand to observe\xe2\x80\x94in respect to his valour\xe2\x80\x94that even on this\r\ncompleted reasoning he still hung fire. He had been waiting for Mrs.\r\nPocock and the sound of the oracle; but he had to gird himself\r\nafresh\xe2\x80\x94which he did in the embrasure of the window, neither advancing\r\nnor retreating\xe2\x80\x94before provoking the revelation. It was apparently for\r\nSarah to come more into view; he was in that case there at her service.\r\nShe did however, as meanwhile happened, come more into view; only she\r\nluckily came at the last minute as a contradiction of Sarah. The\r\noccupant of the balcony was after all quite another person, a person\r\npresented, on a second look, by a charming back and a slight shift of\r\nher position, as beautiful brilliant unconscious Mamie\xe2\x80\x94Mamie alone at\r\nhome, Mamie passing her time in her own innocent way, Mamie in short\r\nrather shabbily used, but Mamie absorbed interested and interesting.\r\nWith her arms on the balustrade and her attention dropped to the street\r\nshe allowed Strether to watch her, to consider several things, without\r\nher turning round.\r\n\r\nBut the oddity was that when he _had_ so watched and considered he\r\nsimply stepped back into the room without following up his advantage.\r\nHe revolved there again for several minutes, quite as with something\r\nnew to think of and as if the bearings of the possibility of Sarah had\r\nbeen superseded. For frankly, yes, it _had_ bearings thus to find the\r\ngirl in solitary possession. There was something in it that touched him\r\nto a point not to have been reckoned beforehand, something that softly\r\nbut quite pressingly spoke to him, and that spoke the more each time he\r\npaused again at the edge of the balcony and saw her still unaware. Her\r\ncompanions were plainly scattered; Sarah would be off somewhere with\r\nWaymarsh and Chad off somewhere with Jim. Strether didn\xe2\x80\x99t at all\r\nmentally impute to Chad that he was with his \xe2\x80\x9cgood friend\xe2\x80\x9d; he gave him\r\nthe benefit of supposing him involved in appearances that, had he had\r\nto describe them\xe2\x80\x94for instance to Maria\xe2\x80\x94he would have conveniently\r\nqualified as more subtle. It came to him indeed the next thing that\r\nthere was perhaps almost an excess of refinement in having left Mamie\r\nin such weather up there alone; however she might in fact have\r\nextemporised, under the charm of the Rue de Rivoli, a little makeshift\r\nParis of wonder and fancy. Our friend in any case now recognised\xe2\x80\x94and it\r\nwas as if at the recognition Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s fixed intensity had\r\nsuddenly, with a deep audible gasp, grown thin and vague\xe2\x80\x94that day after\r\nday he had been conscious in respect to his young lady of something odd\r\nand ambiguous, yet something into which he could at last read a\r\nmeaning. It had been at the most, this mystery, an obsession\xe2\x80\x94oh an\r\nobsession agreeable; and it had just now fallen into its place as at\r\nthe touch of a spring. It had represented the possibility between them\r\nof some communication baffled by accident and delay\xe2\x80\x94the possibility\r\neven of some relation as yet unacknowledged.\r\n\r\nThere was always their old relation, the fruit of the Woollett years;\r\nbut that\xe2\x80\x94and it was what was strangest\xe2\x80\x94had nothing whatever in common\r\nwith what was now in the air. As a child, as a \xe2\x80\x9cbud,\xe2\x80\x9d and then again as\r\na flower of expansion, Mamie had bloomed for him, freely, in the almost\r\nincessantly open doorways of home; where he remembered her as first\r\nvery forward, as then very backward\xe2\x80\x94for he had carried on at one\r\nperiod, in Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s parlours (oh Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s phases and his\r\nown!) a course of English Literature re-enforced by exams and teas\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nonce more, finally, as very much in advance. But he had kept no great\r\nsense of points of contact; it not being in the nature of things at\r\nWoollett that the freshest of the buds should find herself in the same\r\nbasket with the most withered of the winter apples. The child had given\r\nsharpness, above all, to his sense of the flight of time; it was but\r\nthe day before yesterday that he had tripped up on her hoop, yet his\r\nexperience of remarkable women\xe2\x80\x94destined, it would seem, remarkably to\r\ngrow\xe2\x80\x94felt itself ready this afternoon, quite braced itself, to include\r\nher. She had in fine more to say to him than he had ever dreamed the\r\npretty girl of the moment _could_ have; and the proof of the\r\ncircumstance was that, visibly, unmistakeably, she had been able to say\r\nit to no one else. It was something she could mention neither to her\r\nbrother, to her sister-in-law nor to Chad; though he could just imagine\r\nthat had she still been at home she might have brought it out, as a\r\nsupreme tribute to age, authority and attitude, for Mrs. Newsome. It\r\nwas moreover something in which they all took an interest; the strength\r\nof their interest was in truth just the reason of her prudence. All\r\nthis then, for five minutes, was vivid to Strether, and it put before\r\nhim that, poor child, she had now but her prudence to amuse her. That,\r\nfor a pretty girl in Paris, struck him, with a rush, as a sorry state;\r\nso that under the impression he went out to her with a step as\r\nhypocritically alert, he was well aware, as if he had just come into\r\nthe room. She turned with a start at his voice; preoccupied with him\r\nthough she might be, she was just a scrap disappointed. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I thought\r\nyou were Mr. Bilham!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe remark had been at first surprising and our friend\xe2\x80\x99s private\r\nthought, under the influence of it, temporarily blighted; yet we are\r\nable to add that he presently recovered his inward tone and that many a\r\nfresh flower of fancy was to bloom in the same air. Little Bilham\xe2\x80\x94since\r\nlittle Bilham was, somewhat incongruously, expected\xe2\x80\x94appeared\r\nbehindhand; a circumstance by which Strether was to profit. They came\r\nback into the room together after a little, the couple on the balcony,\r\nand amid its crimson-and-gold elegance, with the others still absent,\r\nStrether passed forty minutes that he appraised even at the time as\r\nfar, in the whole queer connexion, from his idlest. Yes indeed, since\r\nhe had the other day so agreed with Maria about the inspiration of the\r\nlurid, here was something for his problem that surely didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it\r\nshrink and that was floated in upon him as part of a sudden flood. He\r\nwas doubtless not to know till afterwards, on turning them over in\r\nthought, of how many elements his impression was composed; but he none\r\nthe less felt, as he sat with the charming girl, the signal growth of a\r\nconfidence. For she _was_ charming, when all was said\xe2\x80\x94and none the less\r\nso for the visible habit and practice of freedom and fluency. She was\r\ncharming, he was aware, in spite of the fact that if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t found\r\nher so he would have found her something he should have been in peril\r\nof expressing as \xe2\x80\x9cfunny.\xe2\x80\x9d Yes, she was funny, wonderful Mamie, and\r\nwithout dreaming it; she was bland, she was bridal\xe2\x80\x94with never, that he\r\ncould make out as yet, a bridegroom to support it; she was handsome and\r\nportly and easy and chatty, soft and sweet and almost disconcertingly\r\nreassuring. She was dressed, if we might so far discriminate, less as a\r\nyoung lady than as an old one\xe2\x80\x94had an old one been supposable to\r\nStrether as so committed to vanity; the complexities of her hair missed\r\nmoreover also the looseness of youth; and she had a mature manner of\r\nbending a little, as to encourage and reward, while she held neatly\r\ntogether in front of her a pair of strikingly polished hands: the\r\ncombination of all of which kept up about her the glamour of her\r\n\xe2\x80\x9creceiving,\xe2\x80\x9d placed her again perpetually between the windows and\r\nwithin sound of the ice-cream plates, suggested the enumeration of all\r\nthe names, all the Mr. Brookses and Mr. Snookses, gregarious specimens\r\nof a single type, she was happy to \xe2\x80\x9cmeet.\xe2\x80\x9d But if all this was where\r\nshe was funny, and if what was funnier than the rest was the contrast\r\nbetween her beautiful benevolent patronage\xe2\x80\x94such a hint of the\r\npolysyllabic as might make her something of a bore toward middle\r\nage\xe2\x80\x94and her rather flat little voice, the voice, naturally,\r\nunaffectedly yet, of a girl of fifteen; so Strether, none the less, at\r\nthe end of ten minutes, felt in her a quiet dignity that pulled things\r\nbravely together. If quiet dignity, almost more than matronly, with\r\nvoluminous, too voluminous clothes, was the effect she proposed to\r\nproduce, that was an ideal one could like in her when once one had got\r\ninto relation. The great thing now for her visitor was that this was\r\nexactly what he had done; it made so extraordinary a mixture of the\r\nbrief and crowded hour. It was the mark of a relation that he had begun\r\nso quickly to find himself sure she was, of all people, as might have\r\nbeen said, on the side and of the party of Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s original\r\nambassador. She was in _his_ interest and not in Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s, and some sign\r\nof that was precisely what he had been feeling in her, these last days,\r\nas imminent. Finally placed, in Paris, in immediate presence of the\r\nsituation and of the hero of it\xe2\x80\x94by whom Strether was incapable of\r\nmeaning any one but Chad\xe2\x80\x94she had accomplished, and really in a manner\r\nall unexpected to herself, a change of base; deep still things had come\r\nto pass within her, and by the time she had grown sure of them Strether\r\nhad become aware of the little drama. When she knew where she was, in\r\nshort, he had made it out; and he made it out at present still better;\r\nthough with never a direct word passing between them all the while on\r\nthe subject of his own predicament. There had been at first, as he sat\r\nthere with her, a moment during which he wondered if she meant to break\r\nground in respect to his prime undertaking. That door stood so\r\nstrangely ajar that he was half-prepared to be conscious, at any\r\njuncture, of her having, of any one\xe2\x80\x99s having, quite bounced in. But,\r\nfriendly, familiar, light of touch and happy of tact, she exquisitely\r\nstayed out; so that it was for all the world as if to show she could\r\ndeal with him without being reduced to\xe2\x80\x94well, scarcely anything.\r\n\r\nIt fully came up for them then, by means of their talking of everything\r\n_but_ Chad, that Mamie, unlike Sarah, unlike Jim, knew perfectly what\r\nhad become of him. It fully came up that she had taken to the last\r\nfraction of an inch the measure of the change in him, and that she\r\nwanted Strether to know what a secret she proposed to make of it. They\r\ntalked most conveniently\xe2\x80\x94as if they had had no chance yet\xe2\x80\x94about\r\nWoollett; and that had virtually the effect of their keeping the secret\r\nmore close. The hour took on for Strether, little by little, a queer\r\nsad sweetness of quality, he had such a revulsion in Mamie\xe2\x80\x99s favour and\r\non behalf of her social value as might have come from remorse at some\r\nearly injustice. She made him, as under the breath of some vague\r\nwestern whiff, homesick and freshly restless; he could really for the\r\ntime have fancied himself stranded with her on a far shore, during an\r\nominous calm, in a quaint community of shipwreck. Their little\r\ninterview was like a picnic on a coral strand; they passed each other,\r\nwith melancholy smiles and looks sufficiently allusive, such cupfuls of\r\nwater as they had saved. Especially sharp in Strether meanwhile was the\r\nconviction that his companion really knew, as we have hinted, where she\r\nhad come out. It was at a very particular place\xe2\x80\x94only _that_ she would\r\nnever tell him; it would be above all what he should have to puzzle for\r\nhimself. This was what he hoped for, because his interest in the girl\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be complete without it. No more would the appreciation to\r\nwhich she was entitled\xe2\x80\x94so assured was he that the more he saw of her\r\nprocess the more he should see of her pride. She saw, herself,\r\neverything; but she knew what she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want, and that it was that had\r\nhelped her. What didn\xe2\x80\x99t she want?\xe2\x80\x94there was a pleasure lost for her old\r\nfriend in not yet knowing, as there would doubtless be a thrill in\r\ngetting a glimpse. Gently and sociably she kept that dark to him, and\r\nit was as if she soothed and beguiled him in other ways to make up for\r\nit. She came out with her impression of Madame de Vionnet\xe2\x80\x94of whom she\r\nhad \xe2\x80\x9cheard so much\xe2\x80\x9d; she came out with her impression of Jeanne, whom\r\nshe had been \xe2\x80\x9cdying to see\xe2\x80\x9d: she brought it out with a blandness by\r\nwhich her auditor was really stirred that she had been with Sarah early\r\nthat very afternoon, and after dreadful delays caused by all sorts of\r\nthings, mainly, eternally, by the purchase of clothes\xe2\x80\x94clothes that\r\nunfortunately wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be themselves eternal\xe2\x80\x94to call in the Rue de\r\nBellechasse.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of these names Strether almost blushed to feel that he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have sounded them first\xe2\x80\x94and yet couldn\xe2\x80\x99t either have justified\r\nhis squeamishness. Mamie made them easy as he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have begun to\r\ndo, and yet it could only have cost her more than he should ever have\r\nhad to spend. It was as friends of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s, friends special,\r\ndistinguished, desirable, enviable, that she spoke of them, and she\r\nbeautifully carried it off that much as she had heard of them\xe2\x80\x94though\r\nshe didn\xe2\x80\x99t say how or where, which was a touch of her own\xe2\x80\x94she had found\r\nthem beyond her supposition. She abounded in praise of them, and after\r\nthe manner of Woollett\xe2\x80\x94which made the manner of Woollett a loveable\r\nthing again to Strether. He had never so felt the true inwardness of it\r\nas when his blooming companion pronounced the elder of the ladies of\r\nthe Rue de Bellechasse too fascinating for words and declared of the\r\nyounger that she was perfectly ideal, a real little monster of charm.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said of Jeanne, \xe2\x80\x9cought ever to happen to her\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\nawfully right as she is. Another touch will spoil her\xe2\x80\x94so she oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nto _be_ touched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but things, here in Paris,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether observed, \xe2\x80\x9cdo happen to little\r\ngirls.\xe2\x80\x9d And then for the joke\xe2\x80\x99s and the occasion\xe2\x80\x99s sake: \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nfound that yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat things happen\xe2\x80\x94? Oh I\xe2\x80\x99m not a little girl. I\xe2\x80\x99m a big battered\r\nblowsy one. _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x9d Mamie laughed, \xe2\x80\x9c_what_ happens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether had a pause while he wondered if it mightn\xe2\x80\x99t happen that he\r\nshould give her the pleasure of learning that he found her nicer than\r\nhe had really dreamed\xe2\x80\x94a pause that ended when he had said to himself\r\nthat, so far as it at all mattered for her, she had in fact perhaps\r\nalready made this out. He risked accordingly a different\r\nquestion\xe2\x80\x94though conscious, as soon as he had spoken, that he seemed to\r\nplace it in relation to her last speech. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that Mademoiselle de\r\nVionnet is to be married\xe2\x80\x94I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of _that_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor all, he then found, he need fear! \xe2\x80\x9cDear, yes; the gentleman was\r\nthere: Monsieur de Montbron, whom Madame de Vionnet presented to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd was he nice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMamie bloomed and bridled with her best reception manner. \xe2\x80\x9cAny man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnice when he\xe2\x80\x99s in love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt made Strether laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cBut is Monsieur de Montbron in\r\nlove\xe2\x80\x94already\xe2\x80\x94with _you?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh that\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s so much better he should be so with\r\n_her_: which, thank goodness, I lost no time in discovering for myself.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly gone\xe2\x80\x94and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have borne it for her if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeen. She\xe2\x80\x99s just too sweet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd through being in love too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn which with a smile that struck him as wonderful Mamie had a\r\nwonderful answer. \xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know if she is or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt made him again laugh out. \xe2\x80\x9cOh but _you_ do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was willing to take it that way. \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I know everything.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nas she sat there rubbing her polished hands and making the best of\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94only holding her elbows perhaps a little too much out\xe2\x80\x94the momentary\r\neffect for Strether was that every one else, in all their affair,\r\nseemed stupid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow that poor little Jeanne doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as near as they came to saying that she was probably in love\r\nwith Chad; but it was quite near enough for what Strether wanted; which\r\nwas to be confirmed in his certitude that, whether in love or not, she\r\nappealed to something large and easy in the girl before him. Mamie\r\nwould be fat, too fat, at thirty; but she would always be the person\r\nwho, at the present sharp hour, had been disinterestedly tender. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\r\nsee a little more of her, as I hope I shall, I think she\xe2\x80\x99ll like me\r\nenough\xe2\x80\x94for she seemed to like me to-day\xe2\x80\x94to want me to tell her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd _shall_ you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly. I shall tell her the matter with her is that she wants only\r\ntoo much to do right. To do right for her, naturally,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mamie, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nto please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer mother, do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer mother first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether waited. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, \xe2\x80\x98then\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Newsome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something really grand for him in the serenity of this\r\nreference. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd last only Monsieur de Montbron?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLast only\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she good-humouredly kept it up.\r\n\r\nStrether considered. \xe2\x80\x9cSo that every one after all then will be suited?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had one of her few hesitations, but it was a question only of a\r\nmoment; and it was her nearest approach to being explicit with him\r\nabout what was between them. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I can speak for myself. _I_ shall\r\nbe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt said indeed so much, told such a story of her being ready to help\r\nhim, so committed to him that truth, in short, for such use as he might\r\nmake of it toward those ends of his own with which, patiently and\r\ntrustfully, she had nothing to do\xe2\x80\x94it so fully achieved all this that he\r\nappeared to himself simply to meet it in its own spirit by the last\r\nfrankness of admiration. Admiration was of itself almost accusatory,\r\nbut nothing less would serve to show her how nearly he understood. He\r\nput out his hand for good-bye with a \xe2\x80\x9cSplendid, splendid, splendid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd he left her, in her splendour, still waiting for little Bilham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook Tenth\r\n\r\n\r\n I\r\n\r\nStrether occupied beside little Bilham, three evenings after his\r\ninterview with Mamie Pocock, the same deep divan they had enjoyed\r\ntogether on the first occasion of our friend\xe2\x80\x99s meeting Madame de\r\nVionnet and her daughter in the apartment of the Boulevard Malesherbes,\r\nwhere his position affirmed itself again as ministering to an easy\r\nexchange of impressions. The present evening had a different stamp; if\r\nthe company was much more numerous, so, inevitably, were the ideas set\r\nin motion. It was on the other hand, however, now strongly marked that\r\nthe talkers moved, in respect to such matters, round an inner, a\r\nprotected circle. They knew at any rate what really concerned them\r\nto-night, and Strether had begun by keeping his companion close to it.\r\nOnly a few of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s guests had dined\xe2\x80\x94that is fifteen or twenty, a few\r\ncompared with the large concourse offered to sight by eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock;\r\nbut number and mass, quantity and quality, light, fragrance, sound, the\r\noverflow of hospitality meeting the high tide of response, had all from\r\nthe first pressed upon Strether\xe2\x80\x99s consciousness, and he felt himself\r\nsomehow part and parcel of the most festive scene, as the term was, in\r\nwhich he had ever in his life been engaged. He had perhaps seen, on\r\nFourths of July and on dear old domestic Commencements, more people\r\nassembled, but he had never seen so many in proportion to the space, or\r\nhad at all events never known so great a promiscuity to show so\r\nmarkedly as picked. Numerous as was the company, it had still been made\r\nso by selection, and what was above all rare for Strether was that, by\r\nno fault of his own, he was in the secret of the principle that had\r\nworked. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t enquired, he had averted his head, but Chad had put\r\nhim a pair of questions that themselves smoothed the ground. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nanswered the questions, he had replied that they were the young man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown affair; and he had then seen perfectly that the latter\xe2\x80\x99s direction\r\nwas already settled.\r\n\r\nChad had applied for counsel only by way of intimating that he knew\r\nwhat to do; and he had clearly never known it better than in now\r\npresenting to his sister the whole circle of his society. This was all\r\nin the sense and the spirit of the note struck by him on that lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narrival; he had taken at the station itself a line that led him without\r\na break, and that enabled him to lead the Pococks\xe2\x80\x94though dazed a\r\nlittle, no doubt, breathless, no doubt, and bewildered\xe2\x80\x94to the uttermost\r\nend of the passage accepted by them perforce as pleasant. He had made\r\nit for them violently pleasant and mercilessly full; the upshot of\r\nwhich was, to Strether\xe2\x80\x99s vision, that they had come all the way without\r\ndiscovering it to be really no passage at all. It was a brave blind\r\nalley, where to pass was impossible and where, unless they stuck fast,\r\nthey would have\xe2\x80\x94which was always awkward\xe2\x80\x94publicly to back out. They\r\nwere touching bottom assuredly tonight; the whole scene represented the\r\nterminus of the _cul-de-sac_. So could things go when there was a hand\r\nto keep them consistent\xe2\x80\x94a hand that pulled the wire with a skill at\r\nwhich the elder man more and more marvelled. The elder man felt\r\nresponsible, but he also felt successful, since what had taken place\r\nwas simply the issue of his own contention, six weeks before, that they\r\nproperly should wait to see what their friends would have really to\r\nsay. He had determined Chad to wait, he had determined him to see; he\r\nwas therefore not to quarrel with the time given up to the business. As\r\nmuch as ever, accordingly, now that a fortnight had elapsed, the\r\nsituation created for Sarah, and against which she had raised no\r\nprotest, was that of her having accommodated herself to her adventure\r\nas to a pleasure-party surrendered perhaps even somewhat in excess to\r\nbustle and to \xe2\x80\x9cpace.\xe2\x80\x9d If her brother had been at any point the least\r\nbit open to criticism it might have been on the ground of his spicing\r\nthe draught too highly and pouring the cup too full. Frankly treating\r\nthe whole occasion of the presence of his relatives as an opportunity\r\nfor amusement, he left it, no doubt, but scant margin as an opportunity\r\nfor anything else. He suggested, invented, abounded\xe2\x80\x94yet all the while\r\nwith the loosest easiest rein. Strether, during his own weeks, had\r\ngained a sense of knowing Paris; but he saw it afresh, and with fresh\r\nemotion, in the form of the knowledge offered to his colleague.\r\n\r\nA thousand unuttered thoughts hummed for him in the air of these\r\nobservations; not the least frequent of which was that Sarah might well\r\nof a truth not quite know whither she was drifting. She was in no\r\nposition not to appear to expect that Chad should treat her handsomely;\r\nyet she struck our friend as privately stiffening a little each time\r\nshe missed the chance of marking the great _nuance_. The great _nuance_\r\nwas in brief that of course her brother must treat her handsomely\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nshould like to see him not; but that treating her handsomely, none the\r\nless, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all in all\xe2\x80\x94treating her handsomely buttered no parsnips;\r\nand that in fine there were moments when she felt the fixed eyes of\r\ntheir admirable absent mother fairly screw into the flat of her back.\r\nStrether, watching, after his habit, and overscoring with thought,\r\npositively had moments of his own in which he found himself sorry for\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94occasions on which she affected him as a person seated in a runaway\r\nvehicle and turning over the question of a possible jump. _Would_ she\r\njump, could she, would _that_ be a safe place?\xe2\x80\x94this question, at such\r\ninstants, sat for him in her lapse into pallor, her tight lips, her\r\nconscious eyes. It came back to the main point at issue: would she be,\r\nafter all, to be squared? He believed on the whole she would jump; yet\r\nhis alternations on this subject were the more especial stuff of his\r\nsuspense. One thing remained well before him\xe2\x80\x94a conviction that was in\r\nfact to gain sharpness from the impressions of this evening: that if\r\nshe _should_ gather in her skirts, close her eyes and quit the carriage\r\nwhile in motion, he would promptly enough become aware. She would\r\nalight from her headlong course more or less directly upon him; it\r\nwould be appointed to him, unquestionably, to receive her entire\r\nweight. Signs and portents of the experience thus in reserve for him\r\nhad as it happened, multiplied even through the dazzle of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s party.\r\nIt was partly under the nervous consciousness of such a prospect that,\r\nleaving almost every one in the two other rooms, leaving those of the\r\nguests already known to him as well as a mass of brilliant strangers of\r\nboth sexes and of several varieties of speech, he had desired five\r\nquiet minutes with little Bilham, whom he always found soothing and\r\neven a little inspiring, and to whom he had actually moreover something\r\ndistinct and important to say.\r\n\r\nHe had felt of old\xe2\x80\x94for it already seemed long ago\xe2\x80\x94rather humiliated at\r\ndiscovering he could learn in talk with a personage so much his junior\r\nthe lesson of a certain moral ease; but he had now got used to\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94whether or no the mixture of the fact with other humiliations had\r\nmade it indistinct, whether or no directly from little Bilham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexample, the example of his being contentedly just the obscure and\r\nacute little Bilham he was. It worked so for him, Strether seemed to\r\nsee; and our friend had at private hours a wan smile over the fact that\r\nhe himself, after so many more years, was still in search of something\r\nthat would work. However, as we have said, it worked just now for them\r\nequally to have found a corner a little apart. What particularly kept\r\nit apart was the circumstance that the music in the salon was\r\nadmirable, with two or three such singers as it was a privilege to hear\r\nin private. Their presence gave a distinction to Chad\xe2\x80\x99s entertainment,\r\nand the interest of calculating their effect on Sarah was actually so\r\nsharp as to be almost painful. Unmistakeably, in her single person, the\r\nmotive of the composition and dressed in a splendour of crimson which\r\naffected Strether as the sound of a fall through a skylight, she would\r\nnow be in the forefront of the listening circle and committed by it up\r\nto her eyes. Those eyes during the wonderful dinner itself he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nonce met; having confessedly\xe2\x80\x94perhaps a little pusillanimously\xe2\x80\x94arranged\r\nwith Chad that he should be on the same side of the table. But there\r\nwas no use in having arrived now with little Bilham at an unprecedented\r\npoint of intimacy unless he could pitch everything into the pot. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nwho sat where you could see her, what does she make of it all? By which\r\nI mean on what terms does she take it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh she takes it, I judge, as proving that the claim of his family is\r\nmore than ever justified.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe isn\xe2\x80\x99t then pleased with what he has to show?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary; she\xe2\x80\x99s pleased with it as with his capacity to do this\r\nkind of thing\xe2\x80\x94more than she has been pleased with anything for a long\r\ntime. But she wants him to show it _there_. He has no right to waste it\r\non the likes of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cShe wants him to move the whole thing over?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole thing\xe2\x80\x94with an important exception. Everything he has \xe2\x80\x98picked\r\nup\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94and the way he knows how. She sees no difficulty in that. She\xe2\x80\x99d run\r\nthe show herself, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll make the handsome concession that Woollett\r\nwould be on the whole in some ways the better for it. Not that it\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be also in some ways the better for Woollett. The people there\r\nare just as good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as good as you and these others? Ah that may be. But such an\r\noccasion as this, whether or no,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether said, \xe2\x80\x9cisn\xe2\x80\x99t the people.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s what has made the people possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d his friend replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthere you are; I give you my\r\nimpression for what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth. Mrs. Pocock has _seen_, and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nto-night how she sits there. If you were to have a glimpse of her face\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d understand me. She has made up her mind\xe2\x80\x94to the sound of expensive\r\nmusic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether took it freely in. \xe2\x80\x9cAh then I shall have news of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to frighten you, but I think that likely. However,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nlittle Bilham continued, \xe2\x80\x9cif I\xe2\x80\x99m of the least use to you to hold on\r\nby\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not of the least!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and Strether laid an appreciative hand on\r\nhim to say it. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one\xe2\x80\x99s of the least.\xe2\x80\x9d With which, to mark how gaily\r\nhe could take it, he patted his companion\xe2\x80\x99s knee. \xe2\x80\x9cI must meet my fate\r\nalone, and I _shall_\xe2\x80\x94oh you\xe2\x80\x99ll see! And yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued the next\r\nmoment, \xe2\x80\x9cyou _can_ help me too. You once said to me\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he followed this\r\nfurther\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat you held Chad should marry. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see then so well as\r\nI know now that you meant he should marry Miss Pocock. Do you still\r\nconsider that he should? Because if you do\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he kept it up\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI want you\r\nimmediately to change your mind. You can help me that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp you by thinking he should _not_ marry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot marry at all events Mamie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether returned, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99m not obliged to say. But Madame de\r\nVionnet\xe2\x80\x94I suggest\xe2\x80\x94when he can.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said little Bilham with some sharpness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh precisely! But he needn\xe2\x80\x99t marry at all\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m at any rate not obliged\r\nto provide for it. Whereas in your case I rather feel that I _am_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham was amused. \xe2\x80\x9cObliged to provide for my marrying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94after all I\xe2\x80\x99ve done to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man weighed it. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you done as much as that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, thus challenged, \xe2\x80\x9cof course I must remember what\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve also done to _me_. We may perhaps call it square. But all the\r\nsame,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish awfully you\xe2\x80\x99d marry Mamie Pocock yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham laughed out. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy it was only the other night, in this\r\nvery place, that you were proposing to me a different union\r\naltogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle de Vionnet?\xe2\x80\x9d Well, Strether easily confessed it. \xe2\x80\x9cThat, I\r\nadmit, was a vain image. _This_ is practical politics. I want to do\r\nsomething good for both of you\xe2\x80\x94I wish you each so well; and you can see\r\nin a moment the trouble it will save me to polish you off by the same\r\nstroke. She likes you, you know. You console her. And she\xe2\x80\x99s splendid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham stared as a delicate appetite stares at an overheaped\r\nplate. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I console her for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt just made his friend impatient. \xe2\x80\x9cOh come, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what proves for you that she likes me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy the fact that I found her three days ago stopping at home alone\r\nall the golden afternoon on the mere chance that you\xe2\x80\x99d come to her, and\r\nhanging over her balcony on that of seeing your cab drive up. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what you want more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham after a moment found it. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly just to know what proves\r\nto you that I like _her_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh if what I\xe2\x80\x99ve just mentioned isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to make you do it, you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\na stony-hearted little fiend. Besides\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Strether encouraged his fancy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nflight\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou showed your inclination in the way you kept her waiting,\r\nkept her on purpose to see if she cared enough for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion paid his ingenuity the deference of a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nkeep her waiting. I came at the hour. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have kept her waiting\r\nfor the world,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man honourably declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter still\xe2\x80\x94then there you are!\xe2\x80\x9d And Strether, charmed, held him the\r\nfaster. \xe2\x80\x9cEven if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t do her justice, moreover,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould insist on your immediately coming round to it. I want awfully to\r\nhave worked it. I want\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and our friend spoke now with a yearning that\r\nwas really earnest\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cat least to have done _that_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo have married me off\xe2\x80\x94without a penny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I shan\xe2\x80\x99t live long; and I give you my word, now and here, that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you every penny of my own. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t many, unfortunately,\r\nbut you shall have them all. And Miss Pocock, I think, has a few. I\r\nwant,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether went on, \xe2\x80\x9cto have been at least to that extent\r\nconstructive even expiatory. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been sacrificing so to strange gods\r\nthat I feel I want to put on record, somehow, my fidelity\xe2\x80\x94fundamentally\r\nunchanged after all\xe2\x80\x94to our own. I feel as if my hands were embrued with\r\nthe blood of monstrous alien altars\xe2\x80\x94of another faith altogether. There\r\nit is\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s done.\xe2\x80\x9d And then he further explained. \xe2\x80\x9cIt took hold of me\r\nbecause the idea of getting her quite out of the way for Chad helps to\r\nclear my ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man, at this, bounced about, and it brought them face to face\r\nin admitted amusement. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want me to marry as a convenience to Chad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether debated\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_he_ doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care whether you marry or not.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s as a convenience simply to my own plan _for_ him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Simply\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and little Bilham\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence was in itself a lively\r\ncomment. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you. But I thought,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cyou had exactly\r\n_no_ plan \xe2\x80\x98for\xe2\x80\x99 him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then call it my plan for myself\xe2\x80\x94which may be well, as you say, to\r\nhave none. His situation, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? is reduced now to the bare\r\nfacts one has to recognise. Mamie doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want him, and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nMamie: so much as that these days have made clear. It\xe2\x80\x99s a thread we can\r\nwind up and tuck in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut little Bilham still questioned. \xe2\x80\x9c_You_ can\xe2\x80\x94since you seem so much\r\nto want to. But why should I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Strether thought it over, but was obliged of course to admit that\r\nhis demonstration did superficially fail. \xe2\x80\x9cSeriously, there _is_ no\r\nreason. It\xe2\x80\x99s my affair\xe2\x80\x94I must do it alone. I\xe2\x80\x99ve only my fantastic need\r\nof making my dose stiff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you call your dose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy what I have to swallow. I want my conditions unmitigated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had spoken in the tone of talk for talk\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and yet with an\r\nobscure truth lurking in the loose folds; a circumstance presently not\r\nwithout its effect on his young friend. Little Bilham\xe2\x80\x99s eyes rested on\r\nhim a moment with some intensity; then suddenly, as if everything had\r\ncleared up, he gave a happy laugh. It seemed to say that if pretending,\r\nor even trying, or still even hoping, to be able to care for Mamie\r\nwould be of use, he was all there for the job. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything in the\r\nworld for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether smiled, \xe2\x80\x9canything in the world is all I want. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow anything that pleased me in her more,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthan the way\r\nthat, on my finding her up there all alone, coming on her unawares and\r\nfeeling greatly for her being so out of it, she knocked down my tall\r\nhouse of cards with her instant and cheerful allusion to the next young\r\nman. It was somehow so the note I needed\xe2\x80\x94her staying at home to receive\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was Chad of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said little Bilham, \xe2\x80\x9cwho asked the next young\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94I like your name for me!\xe2\x80\x94to call.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I supposed\xe2\x80\x94all of which, thank God, is in our innocent and natural\r\nmanners. But do you know,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether asked, \xe2\x80\x9cif Chad knows\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d And then\r\nas this interlocutor seemed at a loss: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy where she has come out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham, at this, met his face with a conscious look\xe2\x80\x94it was as\r\nif, more than anything yet, the allusion had penetrated. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know\r\nyourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether lightly shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cThere I stop. Oh, odd as it may\r\nappear to you, there _are_ things I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I only got the sense\r\nfrom her of something very sharp, and yet very deep down, that she was\r\nkeeping all to herself. That is I had begun with the belief that she\r\n_had_ kept it to herself; but face to face with her there I soon made\r\nout that there was a person with whom she would have shared it. I had\r\nthought she possibly might with _me_\xe2\x80\x94but I saw then that I was only\r\nhalf in her confidence. When, turning to me to greet me\xe2\x80\x94for she was on\r\nthe balcony and I had come in without her knowing it\xe2\x80\x94she showed me she\r\nhad been expecting _you_ and was proportionately disappointed, I got\r\nhold of the tail of my conviction. Half an hour later I was in\r\npossession of all the rest of it. You know what has happened.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nlooked at his young friend hard\xe2\x80\x94then he felt sure. \xe2\x80\x9cFor all you say,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re up to your eyes. So there you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham after an instant pulled half round. \xe2\x80\x9cI assure you she\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t told me anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t. For what do you suggest that I suppose her to\r\ntake you? But you\xe2\x80\x99ve been with her every day, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her freely,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve liked her greatly\xe2\x80\x94I stick to that\xe2\x80\x94and you\xe2\x80\x99ve made your profit of\r\nit. You know what she has been through as well as you know that she has\r\ndined here to-night\xe2\x80\x94which must have put her, by the way, through a good\r\ndeal more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man faced this blast; after which he pulled round the rest of\r\nthe way. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t in the least said she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been nice to me. But\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s proud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd quite properly. But not too proud for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just her pride that has made her. Chad,\xe2\x80\x9d little Bilham loyally\r\nwent on, \xe2\x80\x9chas really been as kind to her as possible. It\xe2\x80\x99s awkward for\r\na man when a girl\xe2\x80\x99s in love with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but she isn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham sat staring before him; then he sprang up as if his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s penetration, recurrent and insistent, made him really after\r\nall too nervous. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94she isn\xe2\x80\x99t now. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t in the least,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChad\xe2\x80\x99s fault. He\xe2\x80\x99s really all right. I mean he would have been\r\nwilling. But she came over with ideas. Those she had got at home. They\r\nhad been her motive and support in joining her brother and his wife.\r\nShe was to _save_ our friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh like me, poor thing?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether also got to his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly\xe2\x80\x94she had a bad moment. It was very soon distinct to her, to\r\npull her up, to let her down, that, alas, he was, he _is_, saved.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing left for her to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot even to love him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe would have loved him better as she originally believed him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course one asks one\xe2\x80\x99s self what notion a little\r\ngirl forms, where a young man\xe2\x80\x99s in question, of such a history and such\r\na state.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this little girl saw them, no doubt, as obscure, but she saw\r\nthem practically as wrong. The wrong for her _was_ the obscure. Chad\r\nturns out at any rate right and good and disconcerting, while what she\r\nwas all prepared for, primed and girded and wound up for, was to deal\r\nwith him as the general opposite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet wasn\xe2\x80\x99t her whole point\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Strether weighed it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat he was to be,\r\nthat he _could_ be, made better, redeemed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham fixed it all a moment, and then with a small headshake\r\nthat diffused a tenderness: \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s too late. Too late for the miracle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94his companion saw enough. \xe2\x80\x9cStill, if the worst fault of his\r\ncondition is that it may be all there for her to profit by\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to \xe2\x80\x98profit,\xe2\x80\x99 in that flat way. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nprofit by another woman\xe2\x80\x99s work\xe2\x80\x94she wants the miracle to have been her\r\nown miracle. _That\xe2\x80\x99s_ what she\xe2\x80\x99s too late for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether quite felt how it all fitted, yet there seemed one loose\r\npiece. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m bound to say, you know, that she strikes one, on these\r\nlines, as fastidious\xe2\x80\x94what you call here _difficile_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Bilham tossed up his chin. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course she\xe2\x80\x99s _difficile_\xe2\x80\x94on any\r\nlines! What else in the world _are_ our Mamies\xe2\x80\x94the real, the right\r\nones?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see, I see,\xe2\x80\x9d our friend repeated, charmed by the responsive wisdom\r\nhe had ended by so richly extracting. \xe2\x80\x9cMamie is one of the real and the\r\nright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very thing itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what it comes to then,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether went on, \xe2\x80\x9cis that poor awful Chad\r\nis simply too good for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh too good was what he was after all to be; but it was she herself,\r\nand she herself only, who was to have made him so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt hung beautifully together, but with still a loose end. \xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he\r\ndo for her even if he should after all break\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith his actual influence?\xe2\x80\x9d Oh little Bilham had for this enquiry the\r\nsharpest of all his controls. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can he \xe2\x80\x98do\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94on any terms\r\nwhatever\xe2\x80\x94when he\xe2\x80\x99s flagrantly spoiled?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether could only meet the question with his passive, his receptive\r\npleasure. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, thank goodness, _you\xe2\x80\x99re_ not! _You_ remain for her to\r\nsave, and I come back, on so beautiful and full a demonstration, to my\r\ncontention of just now\xe2\x80\x94that of your showing distinct signs of her\r\nhaving already begun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe most he could further say to himself\xe2\x80\x94as his young friend turned\r\naway\xe2\x80\x94was that the charge encountered for the moment no renewed denial.\r\nLittle Bilham, taking his course back to the music, only shook his\r\ngood-natured ears an instant, in the manner of a terrier who has got\r\nwet; while Strether relapsed into the sense\xe2\x80\x94which had for him in these\r\ndays most of comfort\xe2\x80\x94that he was free to believe in anything that from\r\nhour to hour kept him going. He had positively motions and flutters of\r\nthis conscious hour-to-hour kind, temporary surrenders to irony, to\r\nfancy, frequent instinctive snatches at the growing rose of\r\nobservation, constantly stronger for him, as he felt, in scent and\r\ncolour, and in which he could bury his nose even to wantonness. This\r\nlast resource was offered him, for that matter, in the very form of his\r\nnext clear perception\xe2\x80\x94the vision of a prompt meeting, in the doorway of\r\nthe room, between little Bilham and brilliant Miss Barrace, who was\r\nentering as Bilham withdrew. She had apparently put him a question, to\r\nwhich he had replied by turning to indicate his late interlocutor;\r\ntoward whom, after an interrogation further aided by a resort to that\r\noptical machinery which seemed, like her other ornaments, curious and\r\narchaic, the genial lady, suggesting more than ever for her fellow\r\nguest the old French print, the historic portrait, directed herself\r\nwith an intention that Strether instantly met. He knew in advance the\r\nfirst note she would sound, and took in as she approached all her need\r\nof sounding it. Nothing yet had been so \xe2\x80\x9cwonderful\xe2\x80\x9d between them as the\r\npresent occasion; and it was her special sense of this quality in\r\noccasions that she was there, as she was in most places, to feed. That\r\nsense had already been so well fed by the situation about them that she\r\nhad quitted the other room, forsaken the music, dropped out of the\r\nplay, abandoned, in a word, the stage itself, that she might stand a\r\nminute behind the scenes with Strether and so perhaps figure as one of\r\nthe famous augurs replying, behind the oracle, to the wink of the\r\nother. Seated near him presently where little Bilham had sat, she\r\nreplied in truth to many things; beginning as soon as he had said to\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94what he hoped he said without fatuity\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAll you ladies are\r\nextraordinarily kind to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe played her long handle, which shifted her observation; she saw in\r\nan instant all the absences that left them free. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can we be\r\nanything else? But isn\xe2\x80\x99t that exactly your plight? \xe2\x80\x98We ladies\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94oh we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nnice, and you must be having enough of us! As one of us, you know, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t pretend I\xe2\x80\x99m crazy about us. But Miss Gostrey at least to-night\r\nhas left you alone, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d With which she again looked about as\r\nif Maria might still lurk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether; \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s only sitting up for me at home.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthen as this elicited from his companion her gay \xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh, oh!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexplained that he meant sitting up in suspense and prayer. \xe2\x80\x9cWe thought\r\nit on the whole better she shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be present; and either way of\r\ncourse it\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible worry for her.\xe2\x80\x9d He abounded in the sense of his\r\nappeal to the ladies, and they might take their choice of his doing so\r\nfrom humility or from pride. \xe2\x80\x9cYet she inclines to believe I shall come\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I incline to believe too you\xe2\x80\x99ll come out!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Miss Barrace, with her\r\nlaugh, was not to be behind. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly the question\xe2\x80\x99s about _where_, isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit? However,\xe2\x80\x9d she happily continued, \xe2\x80\x9cif it\xe2\x80\x99s anywhere at all it must\r\nbe very far on, mustn\xe2\x80\x99t it? To do us justice, I think, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nlaughed, \xe2\x80\x9cwe do, among us all, want you rather far on. Yes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nrepeated in her quick droll way; \xe2\x80\x9cwe want you very, _very_ far on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAfter which she wished to know why he had thought it better Maria\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be present.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cit was really her own idea. I should have wished it.\r\nBut she dreads responsibility.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a new thing for her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo dread it? No doubt\xe2\x80\x94no doubt. But her nerve has given way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barrace looked at him a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has too much at stake.\xe2\x80\x9d Then\r\nless gravely: \xe2\x80\x9cMine, luckily for me, holds out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuckily for me too\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Strether came back to that. \xe2\x80\x9cMy own isn\xe2\x80\x99t so firm,\r\n_my_ appetite for responsibility isn\xe2\x80\x99t so sharp, as that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t felt\r\nthe very principle of this occasion to be \xe2\x80\x98the more the merrier.\xe2\x80\x99 If we\r\n_are_ so merry it\xe2\x80\x99s because Chad has understood so well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has understood amazingly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Barrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful\xe2\x80\x94Strether anticipated for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful!\xe2\x80\x9d she, to meet it, intensified; so that, face to face\r\nover it, they largely and recklessly laughed. But she presently added:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I see the principle. If one didn\xe2\x80\x99t one would be lost. But when once\r\none has got hold of it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s as simple as twice two! From the moment he had to do something\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA crowd\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she took him straight up\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwas the only thing? Rather, rather:\r\na rumpus of sound,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cor nothing. Mrs. Pocock\xe2\x80\x99s built in,\r\nor built out\xe2\x80\x94whichever you call it; she\xe2\x80\x99s packed so tight she can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmove. She\xe2\x80\x99s in splendid isolation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Miss Barrace embroidered the theme.\r\n\r\nStrether followed, but scrupulous of justice. \xe2\x80\x9cYet with every one in\r\nthe place successively introduced to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWonderfully\xe2\x80\x94but just so that it does build her out. She\xe2\x80\x99s bricked up,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s buried alive!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether seemed for a moment to look at it; but it brought him to a\r\nsigh. \xe2\x80\x9cOh but she\xe2\x80\x99s not dead! It will take more than this to kill her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion had a pause that might have been for pity. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npretend I think she\xe2\x80\x99s finished\xe2\x80\x94or that it\xe2\x80\x99s for more than to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe remained pensive as if with the same compunction. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only up to\r\nher chin.\xe2\x80\x9d Then again for the fun of it: \xe2\x80\x9cShe can breathe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe can breathe!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he echoed it in the same spirit. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you know,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s really all this time happening to me?\xe2\x80\x94through the\r\nbeauty of music, the gaiety of voices, the uproar in short of our revel\r\nand the felicity of your wit? The sound of Mrs. Pocock\xe2\x80\x99s respiration\r\ndrowns for me, I assure you, every other. It\xe2\x80\x99s literally all I hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe focussed him with her clink of chains. \xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d she breathed ever\r\nso kindly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe _is_ free from her chin up,\xe2\x80\x9d she mused; \xe2\x80\x9cand that _will_ be enough\r\nfor her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be enough for me!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether ruefully laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cWaymarsh has\r\nreally,\xe2\x80\x9d he then asked, \xe2\x80\x9cbrought her to see you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94but that\xe2\x80\x99s the worst of it. I could do you no good. And yet I\r\ntried hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how did you try?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy I didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. That was better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what would have been worse? For speaking or silent,\xe2\x80\x9d she lightly\r\nwailed, \xe2\x80\x9cI somehow \xe2\x80\x98compromise.\xe2\x80\x99 And it has never been any one but\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat shows\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he was magnanimous\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat it\xe2\x80\x99s something not in you, but in\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s self. It\xe2\x80\x99s _my_ fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was silent a little. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s. It\xe2\x80\x99s the fault of\r\nhis having brought her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether good-naturedly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy _did_ he bring her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford not to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you were a trophy\xe2\x80\x94one of the spoils of conquest? But why in that\r\ncase, since you do \xe2\x80\x98compromise\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t I compromise _him_ as well? I do compromise him as well,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss\r\nBarrace smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cI compromise him as hard as I can. But for Mr.\r\nWaymarsh it isn\xe2\x80\x99t fatal. It\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94so far as his wonderful relation with\r\nMrs. Pocock is concerned\xe2\x80\x94favourable.\xe2\x80\x9d And then, as he still seemed\r\nslightly at sea: \xe2\x80\x9cThe man who had succeeded with _me_, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\r\nFor her to get him from me was such an added incentive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether saw, but as if his path was still strewn with surprises. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x98from\xe2\x80\x99 you then that she has got him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was amused at his momentary muddle. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can fancy my fight! She\r\nbelieves in her triumph. I think it has been part of her joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh her joy!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether sceptically murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she thinks she has had her own way. And what\xe2\x80\x99s to-night for her\r\nbut a kind of apotheosis? Her frock\xe2\x80\x99s really good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood enough to go to heaven in? For after a real apotheosis,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether\r\nwent on, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing _but_ heaven. For Sarah there\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you mean that she won\xe2\x80\x99t find to-morrow heavenly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I mean that I somehow feel to-night\xe2\x80\x94on her behalf\xe2\x80\x94too good to be\r\ntrue. She has had her cake; that is she\xe2\x80\x99s in the act now of having it,\r\nof swallowing the largest and sweetest piece. There won\xe2\x80\x99t be another\r\nleft for her. Certainly _I_ haven\xe2\x80\x99t one. It can only, at the best, be\r\nChad.\xe2\x80\x9d He continued to make it out as for their common entertainment.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe may have one, as it were, up his sleeve; yet it\xe2\x80\x99s borne in upon me\r\nthat if he had\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she quite understood\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chave taken all _this_ trouble? I\r\ndare say not, and, if I may be quite free and dreadful, I very much\r\nhope he won\xe2\x80\x99t take any more. Of course I won\xe2\x80\x99t pretend now,\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnot to know what it\xe2\x80\x99s a question of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh every one must know now,\xe2\x80\x9d poor Strether thoughtfully admitted; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s strange enough and funny enough that one should feel everybody\r\nhere at this very moment to be knowing and watching and waiting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t it indeed funny?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Barrace quite rose to it. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nway we _are_ in Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d She was always pleased with a new contribution\r\nto that queerness. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful! But, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared, \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nall depends on you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to turn the knife in your vitals, but\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s naturally what you just now meant by our all being on top of\r\nyou. We know you as the hero of the drama, and we\xe2\x80\x99re gathered to see\r\nwhat you\xe2\x80\x99ll do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether looked at her a moment with a light perhaps slightly obscured.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that must be why the hero has taken refuge in this corner.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s scared at his heroism\xe2\x80\x94he shrinks from his part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but we nevertheless believe he\xe2\x80\x99ll play it. That\xe2\x80\x99s why,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss\r\nBarrace kindly went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwe take such an interest in you. We feel\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll come up to the scratch.\xe2\x80\x9d And then as he seemed perhaps not quite\r\nto take fire: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let him do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let Chad go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, keep hold of him. With all this\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and she indicated the general\r\ntribute\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9che has done enough. We love him here\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s charming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cthe way you all can simplify when you\r\nwill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she gave it to him back. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to the way _you_ will when\r\nyou must.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe winced at it as at the very voice of prophecy, and it kept him a\r\nmoment quiet. He detained her, however, on her appearing about to leave\r\nhim alone in the rather cold clearance their talk had made. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\npositively isn\xe2\x80\x99t a sign of a hero to-night; the hero\xe2\x80\x99s dodging and\r\nshirking, the hero\xe2\x80\x99s ashamed. Therefore, you know, I think, what you\r\nmust all _really_ be occupied with is the heroine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barrace took a minute. \xe2\x80\x9cThe heroine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe heroine. I\xe2\x80\x99ve treated her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cnot a bit like a hero.\r\nOh,\xe2\x80\x9d he sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t do it well!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe eased him off. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do it as you can.\xe2\x80\x9d And then after another\r\nhesitation: \xe2\x80\x9cI think she\xe2\x80\x99s satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he remained compunctious. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t been near her. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlooked at her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh then you\xe2\x80\x99ve lost a good deal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe showed he knew it. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s more wonderful than ever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThan ever. With Mr. Pocock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cMadame de Vionnet\xe2\x80\x94with Jim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame de Vionnet\xe2\x80\x94with \xe2\x80\x98Jim.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Barrace was historic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s she doing with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh you must ask _him!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s face lighted again at the prospect. \xe2\x80\x9cIt _will_ be amusing to\r\ndo so.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet he continued to wonder. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she must have some idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course she has\xe2\x80\x94she has twenty ideas. She has in the first place,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Miss Barrace, swinging a little her tortoise-shell, \xe2\x80\x9cthat of doing\r\nher part. Her part is to help _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt came out as nothing had come yet; links were missing and connexions\r\nunnamed, but it was suddenly as if they were at the heart of their\r\nsubject. \xe2\x80\x9cYes; how much more she does it,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether gravely reflected,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthan I help _her!_\xe2\x80\x9d It all came over him as with the near presence of\r\nthe beauty, the grace, the intense, dissimulated spirit with which he\r\nhad, as he said, been putting off contact. \xe2\x80\x9c_She_ has courage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh she has courage!\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Barrace quite agreed; and it was as if for a\r\nmoment they saw the quantity in each other\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\nBut indeed the whole thing was present. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much she must care!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh there it is. She does care. But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t, is it,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Barrace\r\nconsiderately added, \xe2\x80\x9cas if you had ever had any doubt of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether seemed suddenly to like to feel that he really never had. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\r\nof course it\xe2\x80\x99s the whole point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVoil\xc3\xa0!\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Barrace smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s why one came out,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether went on. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s why one has stayed\r\nso long. And it\xe2\x80\x99s also\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he abounded\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhy one\xe2\x80\x99s going home. It\xe2\x80\x99s why,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s why\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s why everything!\xe2\x80\x9d she concurred. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s why she might be\r\nto-night\xe2\x80\x94for all she looks and shows, and for all your friend \xe2\x80\x98Jim\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndoes\xe2\x80\x94about twenty years old. That\xe2\x80\x99s another of her ideas; to be for\r\nhim, and to be quite easily and charmingly, as young as a little girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether assisted at his distance. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98For him\xe2\x80\x99? For Chad\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Chad, in a manner, naturally, always. But in particular to-night\r\nfor Mr. Pocock.\xe2\x80\x9d And then as her friend still stared: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it _is_ of\r\na bravery! But that\xe2\x80\x99s what she has: her high sense of duty.\xe2\x80\x9d It was\r\nmore than sufficiently before them. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Mr. Newsome has his hands so\r\nembarrassed with his sister\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite the least\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Strether filled it out\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat she should take his\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s husband? Certainly\xe2\x80\x94quite the least. So she has taken him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has taken him.\xe2\x80\x9d It was all Miss Barrace had meant.\r\n\r\nStill it remained enough. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be funny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh it _is_ funny.\xe2\x80\x9d That of course essentially went with it.\r\n\r\nBut it brought them back. \xe2\x80\x9cHow indeed then she must care!\xe2\x80\x9d In answer to\r\nwhich Strether\xe2\x80\x99s entertainer dropped a comprehensive \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d expressive\r\nperhaps of some impatience for the time he took to get used to it. She\r\nherself had got used to it long before.\r\n\r\n\r\n II\r\n\r\nWhen one morning within the week he perceived the whole thing to be\r\nreally at last upon him Strether\xe2\x80\x99s immediate feeling was all relief. He\r\nhad known this morning that something was about to happen\xe2\x80\x94known it, in\r\na moment, by Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s manner when Waymarsh appeared before him during\r\nhis brief consumption of coffee and a roll in the small slippery\r\n_salle-\xc3\xa0-manger_ so associated with rich rumination. Strether had taken\r\nthere of late various lonely and absent-minded meals; he communed\r\nthere, even at the end of June, with a suspected chill, the air of old\r\nshivers mixed with old savours, the air in which so many of his\r\nimpressions had perversely matured; the place meanwhile renewing its\r\nmessage to him by the very circumstance of his single state. He now sat\r\nthere, for the most part, to sigh softly, while he vaguely tilted his\r\ncarafe, over the vision of how much better Waymarsh was occupied. That\r\nwas really his success by the common measure\xe2\x80\x94to have led this companion\r\nso on and on. He remembered how at first there had been scarce a\r\nsquatting-place he could beguile him into passing; the actual outcome\r\nof which at last was that there was scarce one that could arrest him in\r\nhis rush. His rush\xe2\x80\x94as Strether vividly and amusedly figured\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94continued to be all with Sarah, and contained perhaps moreover the\r\nword of the whole enigma, whipping up in its fine full-flavoured froth\r\nthe very principle, for good or for ill, of his own, of Strether\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndestiny. It might after all, to the end, only be that they had united\r\nto save him, and indeed, so far as Waymarsh was concerned, that _had_\r\nto be the spring of action. Strether was glad at all events, in\r\nconnexion with the case, that the saving he required was not more\r\nscant; so constituted a luxury was it in certain lights just to lurk\r\nthere out of the full glare. He had moments of quite seriously\r\nwondering whether Waymarsh wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t in fact, thanks to old friendship\r\nand a conceivable indulgence, make about as good terms for him as he\r\nmight make for himself. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the same terms of course; but\r\nthey might have the advantage that he himself probably should be able\r\nto make none at all.\r\n\r\nHe was never in the morning very late, but Waymarsh had already been\r\nout, and, after a peep into the dim refectory, he presented himself\r\nwith much less than usual of his large looseness. He had made sure,\r\nthrough the expanse of glass exposed to the court, that they would be\r\nalone; and there was now in fact that about him that pretty well took\r\nup the room. He was dressed in the garments of summer; and save that\r\nhis white waistcoat was redundant and bulging these things favoured,\r\nthey determined, his expression. He wore a straw hat such as his friend\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet seen in Paris, and he showed a buttonhole freshly adorned\r\nwith a magnificent rose. Strether read on the instant his story\xe2\x80\x94how,\r\nastir for the previous hour, the sprinkled newness of the day, so\r\npleasant at that season in Paris, he was fairly panting with the pulse\r\nof adventure and had been with Mrs. Pocock, unmistakeably, to the\r\nMarch\xc3\xa9 aux Fleurs. Strether really knew in this vision of him a joy\r\nthat was akin to envy; so reversed as he stood there did their old\r\npositions seem; so comparatively doleful now showed, by the sharp turn\r\nof the wheel, the posture of the pilgrim from Woollett. He wondered,\r\nthis pilgrim, if he had originally looked to Waymarsh so brave and\r\nwell, so remarkably launched, as it was at present the latter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprivilege to appear. He recalled that his friend had remarked to him\r\neven at Chester that his aspect belied his plea of prostration; but\r\nthere certainly couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been, for an issue, an aspect less\r\nconcerned than Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s with the menace of decay. Strether had at any\r\nrate never resembled a Southern planter of the great days\xe2\x80\x94which was the\r\nimage picturesquely suggested by the happy relation between the\r\nfuliginous face and the wide panama of his visitor. This type, it\r\nfurther amused him to guess, had been, on Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s part, the object\r\nof Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s care; he was convinced that her taste had not been a\r\nstranger to the conception and purchase of the hat, any more than her\r\nfine fingers had been guiltless of the bestowal of the rose. It came to\r\nhim in the current of thought, as things so oddly did come, that _he_\r\nhad never risen with the lark to attend a brilliant woman to the March\xc3\xa9\r\naux Fleurs; this could be fastened on him in connexion neither with\r\nMiss Gostrey nor with Madame de Vionnet; the practice of getting up\r\nearly for adventures could indeed in no manner be fastened on him. It\r\ncame to him in fact that just here was his usual case: he was for ever\r\nmissing things through his general genius for missing them, while\r\nothers were for ever picking them up through a contrary bent. And it\r\nwas others who looked abstemious and he who looked greedy; it was he\r\nsomehow who finally paid, and it was others who mainly partook. Yes, he\r\nshould go to the scaffold yet for he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know quite whom. He\r\nalmost, for that matter, felt on the scaffold now and really quite\r\nenjoying it. It worked out as _because_ he was anxious there\xe2\x80\x94it worked\r\nout as for this reason that Waymarsh was so blooming. It was _his_ trip\r\nfor health, for a change, that proved the success\xe2\x80\x94which was just what\r\nStrether, planning and exerting himself, had desired it should be. That\r\ntruth already sat full-blown on his companion\xe2\x80\x99s lips; benevolence\r\nbreathed from them as with the warmth of active exercise, and also a\r\nlittle as with the bustle of haste.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Pocock, whom I left a quarter of an hour ago at her hotel, has\r\nasked me to mention to you that she would like to find you at home here\r\nin about another hour. She wants to see you; she has something to\r\nsay\xe2\x80\x94or considers, I believe, that you may have: so that I asked her\r\nmyself why she shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come right round. She hasn\xe2\x80\x99t _been_ round\r\nyet\xe2\x80\x94to see our place; and I took upon myself to say that I was sure\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d be glad to have her. The thing\xe2\x80\x99s therefore, you see, to keep\r\nright here till she comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe announcement was sociably, even though, after Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s wont,\r\nsomewhat solemnly made; but Strether quickly felt other things in it\r\nthan these light features. It was the first approach, from that\r\nquarter, to admitted consciousness; it quickened his pulse; it simply\r\nmeant at last that he should have but himself to thank if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow where he was. He had finished his breakfast; he pushed it away and\r\nwas on his feet. There were plenty of elements of surprise, but only\r\none of doubt. \xe2\x80\x9cThe thing\xe2\x80\x99s for _you_ to keep here too?\xe2\x80\x9d Waymarsh had\r\nbeen slightly ambiguous.\r\n\r\nHe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ambiguous, however, after this enquiry; and Strether\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunderstanding had probably never before opened so wide and effective a\r\nmouth as it was to open during the next five minutes. It was no part of\r\nhis friend\xe2\x80\x99s wish, as appeared, to help to receive Mrs. Pocock; he\r\nquite understood the spirit in which she was to present herself, but\r\nhis connexion with her visit was limited to his having\xe2\x80\x94well, as he\r\nmight say\xe2\x80\x94perhaps a little promoted it. He had thought, and had let her\r\nknow it, that Strether possibly would think she might have been round\r\nbefore. At any rate, as turned out, she had been wanting herself, quite\r\na while, to come. \xe2\x80\x9cI told her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Waymarsh, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it would have been\r\na bright idea if she had only carried it out before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether pronounced it so bright as to be almost dazzling. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why\r\n_hasn\xe2\x80\x99t_ she carried it out before? She has seen me every day\xe2\x80\x94she had\r\nonly to name her hour. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting and waiting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I told her you had. And she has been waiting too.\xe2\x80\x9d It was, in\r\nthe oddest way in the world, on the showing of this tone, a genial new\r\npressing coaxing Waymarsh; a Waymarsh conscious with a different\r\nconsciousness from any he had yet betrayed, and actually rendered by it\r\nalmost insinuating. He lacked only time for full persuasion, and\r\nStrether was to see in a moment why. Meantime, however, our friend\r\nperceived, he was announcing a step of some magnanimity on Mrs.\r\nPocock\xe2\x80\x99s part, so that he could deprecate a sharp question. It was his\r\nown high purpose in fact to have smoothed sharp questions to rest. He\r\nlooked his old comrade very straight in the eyes, and he had never\r\nconveyed to him in so mute a manner so much kind confidence and so much\r\ngood advice. Everything that was between them was again in his face,\r\nbut matured and shelved and finally disposed of. \xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s coming now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nConsidering how many pieces had to fit themselves, it all fell, in\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s brain, into a close rapid order. He saw on the spot what had\r\nhappened, and what probably would yet; and it was all funny enough. It\r\nwas perhaps just this freedom of appreciation that wound him up to his\r\nflare of high spirits. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is she coming _for?_\xe2\x80\x94to kill me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s coming to be very _very_ kind to you, and you must let me say\r\nthat I greatly hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll not be less so to herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was spoken by Waymarsh with much gravity of admonition, and as\r\nStrether stood there he knew he had but to make a movement to take the\r\nattitude of a man gracefully receiving a present. The present was that\r\nof the opportunity dear old Waymarsh had flattered himself he had\r\ndivined in him the slight soreness of not having yet thoroughly\r\nenjoyed; so he had brought it to him thus, as on a little silver\r\nbreakfast-tray, familiarly though delicately\xe2\x80\x94without oppressive pomp;\r\nand he was to bend and smile and acknowledge, was to take and use and\r\nbe grateful. He was not\xe2\x80\x94that was the beauty of it\xe2\x80\x94to be asked to\r\ndeflect too much from his dignity. No wonder the old boy bloomed in\r\nthis bland air of his own distillation. Strether felt for a moment as\r\nif Sarah were actually walking up and down outside. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she hanging\r\nabout the _porte-coch\xc3\xa8re_ while her friend thus summarily opened a way?\r\nStrether would meet her but to take it, and everything would be for the\r\nbest in the best of possible worlds. He had never so much known what\r\nany one meant as, in the light of this demonstration, he knew what Mrs.\r\nNewsome did. It had reached Waymarsh from Sarah, but it had reached\r\nSarah from her mother, and there was no break in the chain by which it\r\nreached _him_. \xe2\x80\x9cHas anything particular happened,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked after a\r\nminute\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cso suddenly to determine her? Has she heard anything unexpected\r\nfrom home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaymarsh, on this, it seemed to him, looked at him harder than ever.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Unexpected\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d He had a brief hesitation; then, however, he was firm.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re leaving Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeaving? That _is_ sudden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaymarsh showed a different opinion. \xe2\x80\x9cLess so than it may seem. The\r\npurpose of Mrs. Pocock\xe2\x80\x99s visit is to explain to you in fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_not_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether didn\xe2\x80\x99t at all know if he had really an advantage\xe2\x80\x94anything that\r\nwould practically count as one; but he enjoyed for the moment\xe2\x80\x94as for\r\nthe first time in his life\xe2\x80\x94the sense of so carrying it off. He\r\nwondered\xe2\x80\x94it was amusing\xe2\x80\x94if he felt as the impudent feel. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall take\r\ngreat pleasure, I assure you, in any explanation. I shall be delighted\r\nto receive Sarah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sombre glow just darkened in his comrade\xe2\x80\x99s eyes; but he was struck\r\nwith the way it died out again. It was too mixed with another\r\nconsciousness\xe2\x80\x94it was too smothered, as might be said, in flowers. He\r\nreally for the time regretted it\xe2\x80\x94poor dear old sombre glow! Something\r\nstraight and simple, something heavy and empty, had been eclipsed in\r\nits company; something by which he had best known his friend. Waymarsh\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t _be_ his friend, somehow, without the occasional ornament of\r\nthe sacred rage, and the right to the sacred rage\xe2\x80\x94inestimably precious\r\nfor Strether\xe2\x80\x99s charity\xe2\x80\x94he also seemed in a manner, and at Mrs. Pocock\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nelbow, to have forfeited. Strether remembered the occasion early in\r\ntheir stay when on that very spot he had come out with his earnest, his\r\nominous \xe2\x80\x9cQuit it!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and, so remembering, felt it hang by a hair that he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t himself now utter the same note. Waymarsh was having a good\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94this was the truth that was embarrassing for him, and he was\r\nhaving it then and there, he was having it in Europe, he was having it\r\nunder the very protection of circumstances of which he didn\xe2\x80\x99t in the\r\nleast approve; all of which placed him in a false position, with no\r\nissue possible\xe2\x80\x94none at least by the grand manner. It was practically in\r\nthe manner of any one\xe2\x80\x94it was all but in poor Strether\xe2\x80\x99s own\xe2\x80\x94that\r\ninstead of taking anything up he merely made the most of having to be\r\nhimself explanatory. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not leaving for the United States direct. Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Pocock and Miss Mamie are thinking of a little trip before\r\ntheir own return, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking for some days past of our\r\njoining forces. We\xe2\x80\x99ve settled it that we do join and that we sail\r\ntogether the end of next month. But we start to-morrow for Switzerland.\r\nMrs. Pocock wants some scenery. She hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had much yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was brave in his way too, keeping nothing back, confessing all there\r\nwas, and only leaving Strether to make certain connexions. \xe2\x80\x9cIs what\r\nMrs. Newsome had cabled her daughter an injunction to break off short?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe grand manner indeed at this just raised its head a little. \xe2\x80\x9cI know\r\nnothing about Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s cables.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met on it with some intensity\xe2\x80\x94during the few seconds of\r\nwhich something happened quite out of proportion to the time. It\r\nhappened that Strether, looking thus at his friend, didn\xe2\x80\x99t take his\r\nanswer for truth\xe2\x80\x94and that something more again occurred in consequence\r\nof _that_. Yes\xe2\x80\x94Waymarsh just _did_ know about Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s cables: to\r\nwhat other end than that had they dined together at Bignon\xe2\x80\x99s? Strether\r\nalmost felt for the instant that it was to Mrs. Newsome herself the\r\ndinner had been given; and, for that matter, quite felt how she must\r\nhave known about it and, as he might think, protected and consecrated\r\nit. He had a quick blurred view of daily cables, questions, answers,\r\nsignals: clear enough was his vision of the expense that, when so wound\r\nup, the lady at home was prepared to incur. Vivid not less was his\r\nmemory of what, during his long observation of her, some of her\r\nattainments of that high pitch had cost her. Distinctly she was at the\r\nhighest now, and Waymarsh, who imagined himself an independent\r\nperformer, was really, forcing his fine old natural voice, an\r\noverstrained accompanist. The whole reference of his errand seemed to\r\nmark her for Strether as by this time consentingly familiar to him, and\r\nnothing yet had so despoiled her of a special shade of consideration.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether Sarah has been directed from home\r\nto try me on the matter of my also going to Switzerland?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Waymarsh as manfully as possible, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing whatever\r\nabout her private affairs; though I believe her to be acting in\r\nconformity with things that have my highest respect.\xe2\x80\x9d It was as manful\r\nas possible, but it was still the false note\xe2\x80\x94as it had to be to convey\r\nso sorry a statement. He knew everything, Strether more and more felt,\r\nthat he thus disclaimed, and his little punishment was just in this\r\ndoom to a second fib. What falser position\xe2\x80\x94given the man\xe2\x80\x94could the most\r\nvindictive mind impose? He ended by squeezing through a passage in\r\nwhich three months before he would certainly have stuck fast. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs\r\nPocock will probably be ready herself to answer any enquiry you may put\r\nto her. But,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9c_but_\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d He faltered on it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what? Don\xe2\x80\x99t put her too many?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaymarsh looked large, but the harm was done; he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, do what he\r\nwould, help looking rosy. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t do anything you\xe2\x80\x99ll be sorry for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was an attenuation, Strether guessed, of something else that had\r\nbeen on his lips; it was a sudden drop to directness, and was thereby\r\nthe voice of sincerity. He had fallen to the supplicating note, and\r\nthat immediately, for our friend, made a difference and reinstated him.\r\nThey were in communication as they had been, that first morning, in\r\nSarah\xe2\x80\x99s salon and in her presence and Madame de Vionnet\xe2\x80\x99s; and the same\r\nrecognition of a great good will was again, after all, possible. Only\r\nthe amount of response Waymarsh had then taken for granted was doubled,\r\ndecupled now. This came out when he presently said: \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t assure you _I_ hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll come with us.\xe2\x80\x9d Then it was that his\r\nimplications and expectations loomed up for Strether as almost\r\npathetically gross.\r\n\r\nThe latter patted his shoulder while he thanked him, giving the go-by\r\nto the question of joining the Pococks; he expressed the joy he felt at\r\nseeing him go forth again so brave and free, and he in fact almost took\r\nleave of him on the spot. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall see you again of course before you\r\ngo; but I\xe2\x80\x99m meanwhile much obliged to you for arranging so conveniently\r\nfor what you\xe2\x80\x99ve told me. I shall walk up and down in the court\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94dear little old court which we\xe2\x80\x99ve each bepaced so, this last\r\ncouple of months, to the tune of our flights and our drops, our\r\nhesitations and our plunges: I shall hang about there, all impatience\r\nand excitement, please let Sarah know, till she graciously presents\r\nherself. Leave me with her without fear,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed; \xe2\x80\x9cI assure you I\r\nshan\xe2\x80\x99t hurt her. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think either she\xe2\x80\x99ll hurt _me_: I\xe2\x80\x99m in a\r\nsituation in which damage was some time ago discounted. Besides, _that_\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t what worries you\xe2\x80\x94but don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t explain! We\xe2\x80\x99re all right as we\r\nare: which was the degree of success our adventure was pledged to for\r\neach of us. We weren\xe2\x80\x99t, it seemed, all right as we were before; and\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve got over the ground, all things considered, quickly. I hope\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll have a lovely time in the Alps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaymarsh fairly looked up at him as from the foot of them. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow as I _ought_ really to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the conscience of Milrose in the very voice of Milrose, but, oh\r\nit was feeble and flat! Strether suddenly felt quite ashamed for him;\r\nhe breathed a greater boldness. \xe2\x80\x9c_Let_ yourself, on the contrary, go\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nall agreeable directions. These are precious hours\xe2\x80\x94at our age they\r\nmayn\xe2\x80\x99t recur. Don\xe2\x80\x99t have it to say to yourself at Milrose, next winter,\r\nthat you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t courage for them.\xe2\x80\x9d And then as his comrade queerly\r\nstared: \xe2\x80\x9cLive up to Mrs. Pocock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLive up to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a great help to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaymarsh looked at it as at one of the uncomfortable things that were\r\ncertainly true and that it was yet ironical to say. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s more then\r\nthan you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly your own chance and advantage. Besides,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do in my way contribute. I know what I\xe2\x80\x99m about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaymarsh had kept on his great panama, and, as he now stood nearer the\r\ndoor, his last look beneath the shade of it had turned again to\r\ndarkness and warning. \xe2\x80\x9cSo do I! See here, Strether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to say. \xe2\x80\x98Quit this\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuit this!\xe2\x80\x9d But it lacked its old intensity; nothing of it remained;\r\nit went out of the room with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n III\r\n\r\nAlmost the first thing, strangely enough, that, about an hour later,\r\nStrether found himself doing in Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s presence was to remark\r\narticulately on this failure, in their friend, of what had been\r\nsuperficially his great distinction. It was as if\xe2\x80\x94he alluded of course\r\nto the grand manner\xe2\x80\x94the dear man had sacrificed it to some other\r\nadvantage; which would be of course only for himself to measure. It\r\nmight be simply that he was physically so much more sound than on his\r\nfirst coming out; this was all prosaic, comparatively cheerful and\r\nvulgar. And fortunately, if one came to that, his improvement in health\r\nwas really itself grander than any manner it could be conceived as\r\nhaving cost him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou yourself alone, dear Sarah\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Strether took the\r\nplunge\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chave done him, it strikes me, in these three weeks, as much\r\ngood as all the rest of his time together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a plunge because somehow the range of reference was, in the\r\nconditions, \xe2\x80\x9cfunny,\xe2\x80\x9d and made funnier still by Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s attitude, by the\r\nturn the occasion had, with her appearance, so sensibly taken. Her\r\nappearance was really indeed funnier than anything else\xe2\x80\x94the spirit in\r\nwhich he felt her to be there as soon as she was there, the shade of\r\nobscurity that cleared up for him as soon as he was seated with her in\r\nthe small _salon de lecture_ that had, for the most part, in all the\r\nweeks, witnessed the wane of his early vivacity of discussion with\r\nWaymarsh. It was an immense thing, quite a tremendous thing, for her to\r\nhave come: this truth opened out to him in spite of his having already\r\narrived for himself at a fairly vivid view of it. He had done exactly\r\nwhat he had given Waymarsh his word for\xe2\x80\x94had walked and re-walked the\r\ncourt while he awaited her advent; acquiring in this exercise an amount\r\nof light that affected him at the time as flooding the scene. She had\r\ndecided upon the step in order to give him the benefit of a doubt, in\r\norder to be able to say to her mother that she had, even to abjectness,\r\nsmoothed the way for him. The doubt had been as to whether he mightn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake her as not having smoothed it\xe2\x80\x94and the admonition had possibly come\r\nfrom Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s more detached spirit. Waymarsh had at any rate,\r\ncertainly, thrown his weight into the scale\xe2\x80\x94he had pointed to the\r\nimportance of depriving their friend of a grievance. She had done\r\njustice to the plea, and it was to set herself right with a high ideal\r\nthat she actually sat there in her state. Her calculation was sharp in\r\nthe immobility with which she held her tall parasol-stick upright and\r\nat arm\xe2\x80\x99s length, quite as if she had struck the place to plant her\r\nflag; in the separate precautions she took not to show as nervous; in\r\nthe aggressive repose in which she did quite nothing but wait for him.\r\nDoubt ceased to be possible from the moment he had taken in that she\r\nhad arrived with no proposal whatever; that her concern was simply to\r\nshow what she had come to receive. She had come to receive his\r\nsubmission, and Waymarsh was to have made it plain to him that she\r\nwould expect nothing less. He saw fifty things, her host, at this\r\nconvenient stage; but one of those he most saw was that their anxious\r\nfriend hadn\xe2\x80\x99t quite had the hand required of him. Waymarsh _had_,\r\nhowever, uttered the request that she might find him mild, and while\r\nhanging about the court before her arrival he had turned over with zeal\r\nthe different ways in which he could be so. The difficulty was that if\r\nhe was mild he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, for her purpose, conscious. If she wished him\r\nconscious\xe2\x80\x94as everything about her cried aloud that she did\xe2\x80\x94she must\r\naccordingly be at costs to make him so. Conscious he _was_, for\r\nhimself\xe2\x80\x94but only of too many things; so she must choose the one she\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nPractically, however, it at last got itself named, and when once that\r\nhad happened they were quite at the centre of their situation. One\r\nthing had really done as well as another; when Strether had spoken of\r\nWaymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s leaving him, and that had necessarily brought on a reference\r\nto Mrs. Pocock\xe2\x80\x99s similar intention, the jump was but short to supreme\r\nlucidity. Light became indeed after that so intense that Strether would\r\ndoubtless have but half made out, in the prodigious glare, by which of\r\nthe two the issue had been in fact precipitated. It was, in their\r\ncontracted quarters, as much there between them as if it had been\r\nsomething suddenly spilled with a crash and a splash on the floor. The\r\nform of his submission was to be an engagement to acquit himself within\r\nthe twenty-four hours. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll go in a moment if you give him the\r\nword\xe2\x80\x94he assures me on his honour he\xe2\x80\x99ll do that\xe2\x80\x9d: this came in its\r\norder, out of its order, in respect to Chad, after the crash had\r\noccurred. It came repeatedly during the time taken by Strether to feel\r\nthat he was even more fixed in his rigour than he had supposed\xe2\x80\x94the time\r\nhe was not above adding to a little by telling her that such a way of\r\nputting it on her brother\xe2\x80\x99s part left him sufficiently surprised. She\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t at all funny at last\xe2\x80\x94she was really fine; and he felt easily\r\nwhere she was strong\xe2\x80\x94strong for herself. It hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet so come home to\r\nhim that she was nobly and appointedly officious. She was acting in\r\ninterests grander and clearer than that of her poor little personal,\r\npoor little Parisian equilibrium, and all his consciousness of her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s moral pressure profited by this proof of its sustaining force.\r\nShe would be held up; she would be strengthened; he needn\xe2\x80\x99t in the\r\nleast be anxious for her. What would once more have been distinct to\r\nhim had he tried to make it so was that, as Mrs. Newsome was\r\nessentially all moral pressure, the presence of this element was almost\r\nidentical with her own presence. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t perhaps that he felt he was\r\ndealing with her straight, but it was certainly as if she had been\r\ndealing straight with _him_. She was reaching him somehow by the\r\nlengthened arm of the spirit, and he was having to that extent to take\r\nher into account; but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t reaching her in turn, not making her\r\ntake _him_; he was only reaching Sarah, who appeared to take so little\r\nof him. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething has clearly passed between you and Chad,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\npresently said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I think I ought to know something more about.\r\nDoes he put it all,\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled, \xe2\x80\x9con me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you come out,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cto put it all on _him?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he replied to this no further than, after an instant, by saying:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Chad I mean\xe2\x80\x99s all right in having said to you\xe2\x80\x94well\r\nanything he may have said. I\xe2\x80\x99ll _take_ it all\xe2\x80\x94what he does put on me.\r\nOnly I must see him before I see you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, but she brought it out. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it absolutely necessary you\r\nshould see me again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, if I\xe2\x80\x99m to give you any definite word about anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it your idea then,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I shall keep on meeting you\r\nonly to be exposed to fresh humiliation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe fixed her a longer time. \xe2\x80\x9cAre your instructions from Mrs. Newsome\r\nthat you shall, even at the worst, absolutely and irretrievably break\r\nwith me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy instructions from Mrs. Newsome are, if you please, my affair. You\r\nknow perfectly what your own were, and you can judge for yourself of\r\nwhat it can do for you to have made what you have of them. You can\r\nperfectly see, at any rate, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go so far as to say, that if I wish\r\nnot to expose myself I must wish still less to expose _her_.\xe2\x80\x9d She had\r\nalready said more than she had quite expected; but, though she had also\r\npulled up, the colour in her face showed him he should from one moment\r\nto the other have it all. He now indeed felt the high importance of his\r\nhaving it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d she broke out as if to explain\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\nis your conduct but an outrage to women like _us?_ I mean your acting\r\nas if there can be a doubt\xe2\x80\x94as between us and such another\xe2\x80\x94of his duty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thought a moment. It was rather much to deal with at once; not only\r\nthe question itself, but the sore abysses it revealed. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re totally different kinds of duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you pretend that he has any at all\xe2\x80\x94to such another?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to Madame de Vionnet?\xe2\x80\x9d He uttered the name not to affront\r\nher, but yet again to gain time\xe2\x80\x94time that he needed for taking in\r\nsomething still other and larger than her demand of a moment before. It\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t at once that he could see all that was in her actual challenge;\r\nbut when he did he found himself just checking a low vague sound, a\r\nsound which was perhaps the nearest approach his vocal chords had ever\r\nknown to a growl. Everything Mrs. Pocock had failed to give a sign of\r\nrecognising in Chad as a particular part of a transformation\xe2\x80\x94everything\r\nthat had lent intention to this particular failure\xe2\x80\x94affected him as\r\ngathered into a large loose bundle and thrown, in her words, into his\r\nface. The missile made him to that extent catch his breath; which\r\nhowever he presently recovered. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy when a woman\xe2\x80\x99s at once so charming\r\nand so beneficent\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can sacrifice mothers and sisters to her without a blush and can\r\nmake them cross the ocean on purpose to feel the more and take from you\r\nthe straighter, _how_ you do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, she had taken him up as short and as sharply as that, but he tried\r\nnot to flounder in her grasp. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anything I\xe2\x80\x99ve done\r\nin any such calculated way as you describe. Everything has come as a\r\nsort of indistinguishable part of everything else. Your coming out\r\nbelonged closely to my having come before you, and my having come was a\r\nresult of our general state of mind. Our general state of mind had\r\nproceeded, on its side, from our queer ignorance, our queer\r\nmisconceptions and confusions\xe2\x80\x94from which, since then, an inexorable\r\ntide of light seems to have floated us into our perhaps still queerer\r\nknowledge. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you _like_ your brother as he is,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t you given your mother an intelligible account of all that that\r\ncomes to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt put to her also, doubtless, his own tone, too many things, this at\r\nleast would have been the case hadn\xe2\x80\x99t his final challenge directly\r\nhelped her. Everything, at the stage they had reached, directly helped\r\nher, because everything betrayed in him such a basis of intention. He\r\nsaw\xe2\x80\x94the odd way things came out!\xe2\x80\x94that he would have been held less\r\nmonstrous had he only been a little wilder. What exposed him was just\r\nhis poor old trick of quiet inwardness, what exposed him was his\r\n_thinking_ such offence. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t in the least however the desire to\r\nirritate that Sarah imputed to him, and he could only at last\r\ntemporise, for the moment, with her indignant view. She was altogether\r\nmore inflamed than he had expected, and he would probably understand\r\nthis better when he should learn what had occurred for her with Chad.\r\nTill then her view of his particular blackness, her clear surprise at\r\nhis not clutching the pole she held out, must pass as extravagant. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nleave you to flatter yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, \xe2\x80\x9cthat what you speak of\r\nis what _you\xe2\x80\x99ve_ beautifully done. When a thing has been already\r\ndescribed in such a lovely way\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d But she caught herself up, and her\r\ncomment on his description rang out sufficiently loud. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you consider\r\nher even an apology for a decent woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAh there it was at last! She put the matter more crudely than, for his\r\nown mixed purposes, he had yet had to do; but essentially it was all\r\none matter. It was so much\xe2\x80\x94so much; and she treated it, poor lady, as\r\nso little. He grew conscious, as he was now apt to do, of a strange\r\nsmile, and the next moment he found himself talking like Miss Barrace.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has struck me from the first as wonderful. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking too\r\nmoreover that, after all, she would probably have represented even for\r\nyourself something rather new and rather good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was to have given Mrs. Pocock with this, however, but her best\r\nopportunity for a sound of derision. \xe2\x80\x9cRather new? I hope so with all my\r\nheart!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she might have affected you by her\r\nexquisite amiability\xe2\x80\x94a real revelation, it has seemed to myself; her\r\nhigh rarity, her distinction of every sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had been, with these words, consciously a little \xe2\x80\x9cprecious\xe2\x80\x9d; but he\r\nhad had to be\xe2\x80\x94he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give her the truth of the case without them;\r\nand it seemed to him moreover now that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t care. He had at all\r\nevents not served his cause, for she sprang at its exposed side. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\n\xe2\x80\x98revelation\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94to _me_: I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to such a woman for a revelation? You\r\ntalk to me about \xe2\x80\x98distinction\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94_you_, you who\xe2\x80\x99ve had your\r\nprivilege?\xe2\x80\x94when the most distinguished woman we shall either of us have\r\nseen in this world sits there insulted, in her loneliness, by your\r\nincredible comparison!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether forbore, with an effort, from straying; but he looked all\r\nabout him. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes your mother herself make the point that she sits\r\ninsulted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSarah\xe2\x80\x99s answer came so straight, so \xe2\x80\x9cpat,\xe2\x80\x9d as might have been said,\r\nthat he felt on the instant its origin. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has confided to my\r\njudgement and my tenderness the expression of her personal sense of\r\neverything, and the assertion of her personal dignity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were the very words of the lady of Woollett\xe2\x80\x94he would have known\r\nthem in a thousand; her parting charge to her child. Mrs. Pocock\r\naccordingly spoke to this extent by book, and the fact immensely moved\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she does really feel as you say it\xe2\x80\x99s of course very very\r\ndreadful. I\xe2\x80\x99ve given sufficient proof, one would have thought,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cof my deep admiration for Mrs. Newsome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray what proof would one have thought you\xe2\x80\x99d _call_ sufficient?\r\nThat of thinking this person here so far superior to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wondered again; he waited. \xe2\x80\x9cAh dear Sarah, you must _leave_ me this\r\nperson here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn his desire to avoid all vulgar retorts, to show how, even\r\nperversely, he clung to his rag of reason, he had softly almost wailed\r\nthis plea. Yet he knew it to be perhaps the most positive declaration\r\nhe had ever made in his life, and his visitor\xe2\x80\x99s reception of it\r\nvirtually gave it that importance. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I\xe2\x80\x99m delighted\r\nto do. God knows _we_ don\xe2\x80\x99t want her! You take good care not to meet,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe observed in a still higher key, \xe2\x80\x9cmy question about their life. If\r\nyou do consider it a thing one can even _speak_ of, I congratulate you\r\non your taste!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe life she alluded to was of course Chad\xe2\x80\x99s and Madame de Vionnet\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nwhich she thus bracketed together in a way that made him wince a\r\nlittle; there being nothing for him but to take home her full\r\nintention. It was none the less his inconsequence that while he had\r\nhimself been enjoying for weeks the view of the brilliant woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspecific action, he just suffered from any characterisation of it by\r\nother lips. \xe2\x80\x9cI think tremendously well of her, at the same time that I\r\nseem to feel her \xe2\x80\x98life\xe2\x80\x99 to be really none of my business. It\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nbusiness, that is, only so far as Chad\xe2\x80\x99s own life is affected by it;\r\nand what has happened, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? is that Chad\xe2\x80\x99s has been affected\r\nso beautifully. The proof of the pudding\xe2\x80\x99s in the eating\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he tried,\r\nwith no great success, to help it out with a touch of pleasantry, while\r\nshe let him go on as if to sink and sink. He went on however well\r\nenough, as well as he could do without fresh counsel; he indeed\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand quite firm, he felt, till he should have re-established\r\nhis communications with Chad. Still, he could always speak for the\r\nwoman he had so definitely promised to \xe2\x80\x9csave.\xe2\x80\x9d This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite for\r\nher the air of salvation; but as that chill fairly deepened what did it\r\nbecome but a reminder that one might at the worst perish _with_ her?\r\nAnd it was simple enough\xe2\x80\x94it was rudimentary: not, not to give her away.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI find in her more merits than you would probably have patience with\r\nmy counting over. And do you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he enquired, \xe2\x80\x9cthe effect you\r\nproduce on me by alluding to her in such terms? It\xe2\x80\x99s as if you had some\r\nmotive in not recognising all she has done for your brother, and so\r\nshut your eyes to each side of the matter, in order, whichever side\r\ncomes up, to get rid of the other. I don\xe2\x80\x99t, you must allow me to say,\r\nsee how you can with any pretence to candour get rid of the side\r\nnearest you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNear me\xe2\x80\x94_that_ sort of thing?\xe2\x80\x9d And Sarah gave a jerk back of her head\r\nthat well might have nullified any active proximity.\r\n\r\nIt kept her friend himself at his distance, and he respected for a\r\nmoment the interval. Then with a last persuasive effort he bridged it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t, on your honour, appreciate Chad\xe2\x80\x99s fortunate development?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFortunate?\xe2\x80\x9d she echoed again. And indeed she was prepared. \xe2\x80\x9cI call it\r\nhideous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer departure had been for some minutes marked as imminent, and she was\r\nalready at the door that stood open to the court, from the threshold of\r\nwhich she delivered herself of this judgement. It rang out so loud as\r\nto produce for the time the hush of everything else. Strether quite, as\r\nan effect of it, breathed less bravely; he could acknowledge it, but\r\nsimply enough. \xe2\x80\x9cOh if you think _that_\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen all\xe2\x80\x99s at an end? So much the better. I do think that!\xe2\x80\x9d She passed\r\nout as she spoke and took her way straight across the court, beyond\r\nwhich, separated from them by the deep arch of the _porte-coch\xc3\xa8re_ the\r\nlow victoria that had conveyed her from her own hotel was drawn up. She\r\nmade for it with decision, and the manner of her break, the sharp shaft\r\nof her rejoinder, had an intensity by which Strether was at first kept\r\nin arrest. She had let fly at him as from a stretched cord, and it took\r\nhim a minute to recover from the sense of being pierced. It was not the\r\npenetration of surprise; it was that, much more, of certainty; his case\r\nbeing put for him as he had as yet only put it to himself. She was away\r\nat any rate; she had distanced him\xe2\x80\x94with rather a grand spring, an\r\neffect of pride and ease, after all; she had got into her carriage\r\nbefore he could overtake her, and the vehicle was already in motion. He\r\nstopped halfway; he stood there in the court only seeing her go and\r\nnoting that she gave him no other look. The way he had put it to\r\nhimself was that all quite _might_ be at an end. Each of her movements,\r\nin this resolute rupture, reaffirmed, re-enforced that idea. Sarah\r\npassed out of sight in the sunny street while, planted there in the\r\ncentre of the comparatively grey court, he continued merely to look\r\nbefore him. It probably _was_ all at an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook Eleventh\r\n\r\n\r\n [Note: In the 1909 New York Edition the following two chapters were\r\n placed in the reverse of the order appearing below. Since 1950, most\r\n scholars have agreed, because of the internal evidence of the two\r\n chapters, that an editorial error caused them to be printed in reverse\r\n order. This Etext, like other editions of the past four decades,\r\n corrects the apparent error.\xe2\x80\x94Richard D. Hathaway, preparer of this\r\n electronic text]\r\n\r\n\r\n I\r\n\r\nHe went late that evening to the Boulevard Malesherbes, having his\r\nimpression that it would be vain to go early, and having also, more\r\nthan once in the course of the day, made enquiries of the concierge.\r\nChad hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come in and had left no intimation; he had affairs,\r\napparently, at this juncture\xe2\x80\x94as it occurred to Strether he so well\r\nmight have\xe2\x80\x94that kept him long abroad. Our friend asked once for him at\r\nthe hotel in the Rue de Rivoli, but the only contribution offered there\r\nwas the fact that every one was out. It was with the idea that he would\r\nhave to come home to sleep that Strether went up to his rooms, from\r\nwhich however he was still absent, though, from the balcony, a few\r\nmoments later, his visitor heard eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock strike. Chad\xe2\x80\x99s servant\r\nhad by this time answered for his reappearance; he _had_, the visitor\r\nlearned, come quickly in to dress for dinner and vanish again. Strether\r\nspent an hour in waiting for him\xe2\x80\x94an hour full of strange suggestions,\r\npersuasions, recognitions; one of those that he was to recall, at the\r\nend of his adventure, as the particular handful that most had counted.\r\nThe mellowest lamplight and the easiest chair had been placed at his\r\ndisposal by Baptiste, subtlest of servants; the novel half-uncut, the\r\nnovel lemon-coloured and tender, with the ivory knife athwart it like\r\nthe dagger in a contadina\xe2\x80\x99s hair, had been pushed within the soft\r\ncircle\xe2\x80\x94a circle which, for some reason, affected Strether as softer\r\nstill after the same Baptiste had remarked that in the absence of a\r\nfurther need of anything by Monsieur he would betake himself to bed.\r\nThe night was hot and heavy and the single lamp sufficient; the great\r\nflare of the lighted city, rising high, spending itself afar, played up\r\nfrom the Boulevard and, through the vague vista of the successive\r\nrooms, brought objects into view and added to their dignity. Strether\r\nfound himself in possession as he never yet had been; he had been there\r\nalone, had turned over books and prints, had invoked, in Chad\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabsence, the spirit of the place, but never at the witching hour and\r\nnever with a relish quite so like a pang.\r\n\r\nHe spent a long time on the balcony; he hung over it as he had seen\r\nlittle Bilham hang the day of his first approach, as he had seen Mamie\r\nhang over her own the day little Bilham himself might have seen her\r\nfrom below; he passed back into the rooms, the three that occupied the\r\nfront and that communicated by wide doors; and, while he circulated and\r\nrested, tried to recover the impression that they had made on him three\r\nmonths before, to catch again the voice in which they had seemed then\r\nto speak to him. That voice, he had to note, failed audibly to sound;\r\nwhich he took as the proof of all the change in himself. He had heard,\r\nof old, only what he _could_ then hear; what he could do now was to\r\nthink of three months ago as a point in the far past. All voices had\r\ngrown thicker and meant more things; they crowded on him as he moved\r\nabout\xe2\x80\x94it was the way they sounded together that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let him be\r\nstill. He felt, strangely, as sad as if he had come for some wrong, and\r\nyet as excited as if he had come for some freedom. But the freedom was\r\nwhat was most in the place and the hour, it was the freedom that most\r\nbrought him round again to the youth of his own that he had long ago\r\nmissed. He could have explained little enough to-day either why he had\r\nmissed it or why, after years and years, he should care that he had;\r\nthe main truth of the actual appeal of everything was none the less\r\nthat everything represented the substance of his loss put it within\r\nreach, within touch, made it, to a degree it had never been, an affair\r\nof the senses. That was what it became for him at this singular time,\r\nthe youth he had long ago missed\xe2\x80\x94a queer concrete presence, full of\r\nmystery, yet full of reality, which he could handle, taste, smell, the\r\ndeep breathing of which he could positively hear. It was in the outside\r\nair as well as within; it was in the long watch, from the balcony, in\r\nthe summer night, of the wide late life of Paris, the unceasing soft\r\nquick rumble, below, of the little lighted carriages that, in the\r\npress, always suggested the gamblers he had seen of old at Monte Carlo\r\npushing up to the tables. This image was before him when he at last\r\nbecame aware that Chad was behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe tells me you put it all on _me_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he had arrived after this\r\npromptly enough at that information; which expressed the case however\r\nquite as the young man appeared willing for the moment to leave it.\r\nOther things, with this advantage of their virtually having the night\r\nbefore them, came up for them, and had, as well, the odd effect of\r\nmaking the occasion, instead of hurried and feverish, one of the\r\nlargest, loosest and easiest to which Strether\xe2\x80\x99s whole adventure was to\r\nhave treated him. He had been pursuing Chad from an early hour and had\r\novertaken him only now; but now the delay was repaired by their being\r\nso exceptionally confronted. They had foregathered enough of course in\r\nall the various times; they had again and again, since that first night\r\nat the theatre, been face to face over their question; but they had\r\nnever been so alone together as they were actually alone\xe2\x80\x94their talk\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet been so supremely for themselves. And if many things\r\nmoreover passed before them, none passed more distinctly for Strether\r\nthan that striking truth about Chad of which he had been so often moved\r\nto take note: the truth that everything came happily back with him to\r\nhis knowing how to live. It had been seated in his pleased smile\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nsmile that pleased exactly in the right degree\xe2\x80\x94as his visitor turned\r\nround, on the balcony, to greet his advent; his visitor in fact felt on\r\nthe spot that there was nothing their meeting would so much do as bear\r\nwitness to that facility. He surrendered himself accordingly to so\r\napproved a gift; for what was the meaning of the facility but that\r\nothers _did_ surrender themselves? He didn\xe2\x80\x99t want, luckily, to prevent\r\nChad from living; but he was quite aware that even if he had he would\r\nhimself have thoroughly gone to pieces. It was in truth essentially by\r\nbringing down his personal life to a function all subsidiary to the\r\nyoung man\xe2\x80\x99s own that he held together. And the great point, above all,\r\nthe sign of how completely Chad possessed the knowledge in question,\r\nwas that one thus became, not only with a proper cheerfulness, but with\r\nwild native impulses, the feeder of his stream. Their talk had\r\naccordingly not lasted three minutes without Strether\xe2\x80\x99s feeling basis\r\nenough for the excitement in which he had waited. This overflow fairly\r\ndeepened, wastefully abounded, as he observed the smallness of anything\r\ncorresponding to it on the part of his friend. That was exactly this\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s happy case; he \xe2\x80\x9cput out\xe2\x80\x9d his excitement, or whatever other\r\nemotion the matter involved, as he put out his washing; than which no\r\narrangement could make more for domestic order. It was quite for\r\nStrether himself in short to feel a personal analogy with the laundress\r\nbringing home the triumphs of the mangle.\r\n\r\nWhen he had reported on Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s visit, which he did very fully, Chad\r\nanswered his question with perfect candour. \xe2\x80\x9cI positively referred her\r\nto you\xe2\x80\x94told her she must absolutely see you. This was last night, and\r\nit all took place in ten minutes. It was our first free talk\xe2\x80\x94really the\r\nfirst time she had tackled me. She knew I also knew what her line had\r\nbeen with yourself; knew moreover how little you had been doing to make\r\nanything difficult for her. So I spoke for you frankly\xe2\x80\x94assured her you\r\nwere all at her service. I assured her _I_ was too,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man\r\ncontinued; \xe2\x80\x9cand I pointed out how she could perfectly, at any time,\r\nhave got at me. Her difficulty has been simply her not finding the\r\nmoment she fancied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer difficulty,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether returned, \xe2\x80\x9chas been simply that she finds\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s afraid of you. She\xe2\x80\x99s not afraid of _me_, Sarah, one little scrap;\r\nand it was just because she has seen how I can fidget when I give my\r\nmind to it that she has felt her best chance, rightly enough to be in\r\nmaking me as uneasy as possible. I think she\xe2\x80\x99s at bottom as pleased to\r\n_have_ you put it on me as you yourself can possibly be to put it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what in the world, my dear man,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad enquired in objection to\r\nthis luminosity, \xe2\x80\x9chave I done to make Sally afraid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been \xe2\x80\x98wonderful, wonderful,\xe2\x80\x99 as we say\xe2\x80\x94we poor people who watch\r\nthe play from the pit; and that\xe2\x80\x99s what has, admirably, made her. Made\r\nher all the more effectually that she could see you didn\xe2\x80\x99t set about it\r\non purpose\xe2\x80\x94I mean set about affecting her as with fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad cast a pleasant backward glance over his possibilities of motive.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve only wanted to be kind and friendly, to be decent and\r\nattentive\xe2\x80\x94and I still only want to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether smiled at his comfortable clearness. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, there can\r\ncertainly be no way for it better than by my taking the onus. It\r\nreduces your personal friction and your personal offence to almost\r\nnothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAh but Chad, with his completer conception of the friendly, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nquite have this! They had remained on the balcony, where, after their\r\nday of great and premature heat, the midnight air was delicious; and\r\nthey leaned back in turn against the balustrade, all in harmony with\r\nthe chairs and the flower-pots, the cigarettes and the starlight. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nonus isn\xe2\x80\x99t _really_ yours\xe2\x80\x94after our agreeing so to wait together and\r\njudge together. That was all my answer to Sally,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad pursued\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat we\r\nhave been, that we are, just judging together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid of the burden,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether explained; \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t come in\r\nthe least that you should take it off me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve come very much, it seems\r\nto me, to double up my fore legs in the manner of the camel when he\r\ngets down on his knees to make his back convenient. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve supposed\r\nyou all this while to have been doing a lot of special and private\r\njudging\xe2\x80\x94about which I haven\xe2\x80\x99t troubled you; and I\xe2\x80\x99ve only wished to\r\nhave your conclusion first from you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask more than that; I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nquite ready to take it as it has come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad turned up his face to the sky with a slow puff of his smoke.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether waited a little. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve left you wholly alone; haven\xe2\x80\x99t, I think\r\nI may say, since the first hour or two\xe2\x80\x94when I merely preached\r\npatience\xe2\x80\x94so much as breathed on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you\xe2\x80\x99ve been awfully good!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve both been good then\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ve played the game. We\xe2\x80\x99ve given them the\r\nmost liberal conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chad, \xe2\x80\x9csplendid conditions! It was open to them, open to\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he seemed to make it out, as he smoked, with his eyes still on\r\nthe stars. He might in quiet sport have been reading their horoscope.\r\nStrether wondered meanwhile what had been open to them, and he finally\r\nlet him have it. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was open to them simply to let me alone; to have\r\nmade up their minds, on really seeing me for themselves, that I could\r\ngo on well enough as I was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether assented to this proposition with full lucidity, his\r\ncompanion\xe2\x80\x99s plural pronoun, which stood all for Mrs. Newsome and her\r\ndaughter, having no ambiguity for him. There was nothing, apparently,\r\nto stand for Mamie and Jim; and this added to our friend\xe2\x80\x99s sense of\r\nChad\xe2\x80\x99s knowing what he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cBut they\xe2\x80\x99ve made up their minds to the\r\nopposite\xe2\x80\x94that you _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ go on as you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad continued in the same way; \xe2\x80\x9cthey won\xe2\x80\x99t have it for a\r\nminute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether on his side also reflectively smoked. It was as if their high\r\nplace really represented some moral elevation from which they could\r\nlook down on their recent past. \xe2\x80\x9cThere never was the smallest chance,\r\ndo you know, that they _would_ have it for a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not\xe2\x80\x94no real chance. But if they were willing to think there\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey weren\xe2\x80\x99t willing.\xe2\x80\x9d Strether had worked it all out. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for\r\nyou they came out, but for me. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to see for themselves what\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re doing, but what I\xe2\x80\x99m doing. The first branch of their curiosity\r\nwas inevitably destined, under my culpable delay, to give way to the\r\nsecond; and it\xe2\x80\x99s on the second that, if I may use the expression and\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my marking the invidious fact, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been of late\r\nexclusively perched. When Sarah sailed it was me, in other words, they\r\nwere after.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad took it in both with intelligence and with indulgence. \xe2\x80\x9cIt _is_\r\nrather a business then\xe2\x80\x94what I\xe2\x80\x99ve let you in for!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether had again a brief pause; which ended in a reply that seemed to\r\ndispose once for all of this element of compunction. Chad was to treat\r\nit, at any rate, so far as they were again together, as having done so.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was \xe2\x80\x98in\xe2\x80\x99 when you found me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but it was you,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cwho found _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only found you out. It was you who found me in. It was all in the\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s work for them, at all events, that they should come. And they\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngreatly enjoyed it,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to make them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chad.\r\n\r\nHis companion did himself presently the same justice. \xe2\x80\x9cSo have I. I\r\ntried even this very morning\xe2\x80\x94while Mrs. Pocock was with me. She enjoys\r\nfor instance, almost as much as anything else, not being, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said,\r\nafraid of me; and I think I gave her help in that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad took a deeper interest. \xe2\x80\x9cWas she very very nasty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether debated. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, she was the most important thing\xe2\x80\x94she was\r\ndefinite. She was\xe2\x80\x94at last\xe2\x80\x94crystalline. And I felt no remorse. I saw\r\nthat they must have come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I wanted to see them for myself; so that if it were only for\r\n_that_\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d Chad\xe2\x80\x99s own remorse was as small.\r\n\r\nThis appeared almost all Strether wanted. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t your having seen them\r\nfor yourself then _the_ thing, beyond all others, that has come of\r\ntheir visit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad looked as if he thought it nice of his old friend to put it so.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you count it as anything that you\xe2\x80\x99re dished\xe2\x80\x94if you _are_ dished?\r\nAre you, my dear man, dished?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt sounded as if he were asking if he had caught cold or hurt his foot,\r\nand Strether for a minute but smoked and smoked. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to see her\r\nagain. I must see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you must.\xe2\x80\x9d Then Chad hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94Mother\r\nherself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh your mother\xe2\x80\x94that will depend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as if Mrs. Newsome had somehow been placed by the words very far\r\noff. Chad however endeavoured in spite of this to reach the place.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean it will depend on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether, for all answer, gave him a longish look. \xe2\x80\x9cI was speaking of\r\nSarah. I must positively\xe2\x80\x94though she quite cast me off\xe2\x80\x94see _her_ again.\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t part with her that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she was awfully unpleasant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Strether exhaled. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was what she had to be. I mean that from\r\nthe moment they\xe2\x80\x99re not delighted they can only be\xe2\x80\x94well what I admit she\r\nwas. We gave them,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9ctheir chance to be delighted, and\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve walked up to it, and looked all round it, and not taken it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can bring a horse to water\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d Chad suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely. And the tune to which this morning Sarah wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndelighted\xe2\x80\x94the tune to which, to adopt your metaphor, she refused to\r\ndrink\xe2\x80\x94leaves us on that side nothing more to hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad had a pause, and then as if consolingly: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was never of course\r\nreally the least on the cards that they would be \xe2\x80\x98delighted.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, after all,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether mused. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had to come as\r\nfar round. However\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he shook it off\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s doubtless _my_ performance\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s absurd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are certainly moments,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chad, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you seem to me too good\r\nto be true. Yet if you are true,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cthat seems to be all that\r\nneed concern me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m true, but I\xe2\x80\x99m incredible. I\xe2\x80\x99m fantastic and ridiculous\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexplain myself even _to_ myself. How can they then,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether asked,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cunderstand me? So I don\xe2\x80\x99t quarrel with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. They quarrel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chad rather comfortably, \xe2\x80\x9cwith _us_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nStrether noted once more the comfort, but his young friend had already\r\ngone on. \xe2\x80\x9cI should feel greatly ashamed, all the same, if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t put\r\nit before you again that you ought to think, after all, tremendously\r\nwell. I mean before giving up beyond recall\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d With which insistence, as\r\nfrom a certain delicacy, dropped.\r\n\r\nAh but Strether wanted it. \xe2\x80\x9cSay it all, say it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, at your age, and with what\xe2\x80\x94when all\xe2\x80\x99s said and done\xe2\x80\x94Mother might\r\ndo for you and be for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad had said it all, from his natural scruple, only to that extent; so\r\nthat Strether after an instant himself took a hand. \xe2\x80\x9cMy absence of an\r\nassured future. The little I have to show toward the power to take care\r\nof myself. The way, the wonderful way, she would certainly take care of\r\nme. Her fortune, her kindness, and the constant miracle of her having\r\nbeen disposed to go even so far. Of course, of course\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he summed it up.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are those sharp facts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad had meanwhile thought of another still. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t you really\r\ncare\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend slowly turned round to him. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go if you\xe2\x80\x99ll say you now consider I should. You know,\xe2\x80\x9d he went\r\non, \xe2\x80\x9cI was ready six weeks ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cthat was when you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know _I_ wasn\xe2\x80\x99t! You\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nready at present because you do know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad returned; \xe2\x80\x9cbut all the same I\xe2\x80\x99m sincere. You talk\r\nabout taking the whole thing on your shoulders, but in what light do\r\nyou regard me that you think me capable of letting you pay?\xe2\x80\x9d Strether\r\npatted his arm, as they stood together against the parapet,\r\nreassuringly\xe2\x80\x94seeming to wish to contend that he _had_ the wherewithal;\r\nbut it was again round this question of purchase and price that the\r\nyoung man\xe2\x80\x99s sense of fairness continued to hover. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat it literally\r\ncomes to for you, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll pardon my putting it so, is that you give\r\nup money. Possibly a good deal of money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cif it were only just enough you\xe2\x80\x99d still be\r\njustified in putting it so! But I\xe2\x80\x99ve on my side to remind you too that\r\n_you_ give up money; and more than \xe2\x80\x98possibly\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94quite certainly, as I\r\nshould suppose\xe2\x80\x94a good deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue enough; but I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a certain quantity,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad returned after a\r\nmoment. \xe2\x80\x9cWhereas you, my dear man, you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t be at all said\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Strether took him up\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto have a \xe2\x80\x98quantity\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncertain or uncertain? Very true. Still, I shan\xe2\x80\x99t starve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t _starve!_\xe2\x80\x9d Chad pacifically emphasised; and so, in the\r\npleasant conditions, they continued to talk; though there was, for that\r\nmatter, a pause in which the younger companion might have been taken as\r\nweighing again the delicacy of his then and there promising the elder\r\nsome provision against the possibility just mentioned. This, however,\r\nhe presumably thought best not to do, for at the end of another minute\r\nthey had moved in quite a different direction. Strether had broken in\r\nby returning to the subject of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s passage with Sarah and enquiring\r\nif they had arrived, in the event, at anything in the nature of a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cscene.\xe2\x80\x9d To this Chad replied that they had on the contrary kept\r\ntremendously polite; adding moreover that Sally was after all not the\r\nwoman to have made the mistake of not being. \xe2\x80\x9cHer hands are a good deal\r\ntied, you see. I got so, from the first,\xe2\x80\x9d he sagaciously observed, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nstart of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean she has taken so much from you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t of course in common decency give less: only she\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t expected, I think, that I\xe2\x80\x99d give her nearly so much. And she\r\nbegan to take it before she knew it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she began to like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cas soon as she began to\r\ntake it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she has liked it\xe2\x80\x94also more than she expected.\xe2\x80\x9d After which Chad\r\nobserved: \xe2\x80\x9cBut she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like _me_. In fact she hates me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s interest grew. \xe2\x80\x9cThen why does she want you at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause when you hate you want to triumph, and if she should get me\r\nneatly stuck there she _would_ triumph.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether followed afresh, but looking as he went. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly\xe2\x80\x94in a\r\nmanner. But it would scarce be a triumph worth having if, once\r\nentangled, feeling her dislike and possibly conscious in time of a\r\ncertain quantity of your own, you should on the spot make yourself\r\nunpleasant to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chad, \xe2\x80\x9cshe can bear _me_\xe2\x80\x94could bear me at least at home.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s my being there that would be her triumph. She hates me in Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe hates in other words\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, _that\xe2\x80\x99s_ it!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Chad had quickly understood this understanding;\r\nwhich formed on the part of each as near an approach as they had yet\r\nmade to naming Madame de Vionnet. The limitations of their distinctness\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t, however, prevent its fairly lingering in the air that it was\r\nthis lady Mrs. Pocock hated. It added one more touch moreover to their\r\nestablished recognition of the rare intimacy of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s association with\r\nher. He had never yet more twitched away the last light veil from this\r\nphenomenon than in presenting himself as confounded and submerged in\r\nthe feeling she had created at Woollett. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you who hates\r\nme too,\xe2\x80\x9d he immediately went on.\r\n\r\nStrether knew as immediately whom he meant, but with as prompt a\r\nprotest. \xe2\x80\x9cAh no! Mamie doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hate\xe2\x80\x94well,\xe2\x80\x9d he caught himself in\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9canybody at all. Mamie\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just why I mind it. She certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much do you mind it? What would you do for her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99d like her if she\xe2\x80\x99d like me. Really, really,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad declared.\r\n\r\nIt gave his companion a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause. \xe2\x80\x9cYou asked me just now if I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t, as you said, \xe2\x80\x98care\xe2\x80\x99 about a certain person. You rather tempt me\r\ntherefore to put the question in my turn. Don\xe2\x80\x99t _you_ care about a\r\ncertain other person?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad looked at him hard in the lamplight of the window. \xe2\x80\x9cThe difference\r\nis that I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether wondered. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t want\xe2\x80\x99 to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI try not to\xe2\x80\x94that is I _have_ tried. I\xe2\x80\x99ve done my best. You can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nsurprised,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man easily went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you yourself set me on\r\nit. I was indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9calready on it a little; but you set me\r\nharder. It was six weeks ago that I thought I had come out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether took it well in. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you haven\xe2\x80\x99t come out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s what I _want_ to know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chad. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I could\r\nhave sufficiently wanted\xe2\x80\x94by myself\xe2\x80\x94to go back, I think I might have\r\nfound out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Strether considered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut all you were able to achieve was\r\nto want to want to! And even then,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, \xe2\x80\x9conly till our friends\r\nthere came. Do you want to want to still?\xe2\x80\x9d As with a sound\r\nhalf-dolorous, half-droll and all vague and equivocal, Chad buried his\r\nface for a little in his hands, rubbing it in a whimsical way that\r\namounted to an evasion, he brought it out more sharply: \xe2\x80\x9c_Do_ you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad kept for a time his attitude, but at last he looked up, and then\r\nabruptly, \xe2\x80\x9cJim _is_ a damned dose!\xe2\x80\x9d he declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to abuse or describe or in any way pronounce on\r\nyour relatives; I simply put it to you once more whether you\xe2\x80\x99re _now_\r\nready. You say you\xe2\x80\x99ve \xe2\x80\x98seen.\xe2\x80\x99 Is what you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that you can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nresist?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad gave him a strange smile\xe2\x80\x94the nearest approach he had ever shown to\r\na troubled one. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you make me _not_ resist?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat it comes to,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether went on very gravely now and as if he\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard him, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat it comes to is that more has been done for you,\r\nI think, than I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen done\xe2\x80\x94attempted perhaps, but never so\r\nsuccessfully done\xe2\x80\x94by one human being for another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh an immense deal certainly\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Chad did it full justice. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\r\nyourself are adding to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was without heeding this either that his visitor continued. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd our\r\nfriends there won\xe2\x80\x99t have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they simply won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey demand you on the basis, as it were, of repudiation and\r\ningratitude; and what has been the matter with me,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether went on,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen my way to working with you for repudiation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad appreciated this. \xe2\x80\x9cThen as you haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen yours you naturally\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t seen mine. There it is.\xe2\x80\x9d After which he proceeded, with a\r\ncertain abruptness, to a sharp interrogation. \xe2\x80\x9c_Now_ do you say she\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t hate me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94Mother. We called it Sarah, but it comes to the same thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether objected, \xe2\x80\x9cnot to the same thing as her hating _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn which\xe2\x80\x94though as if for an instant it had hung fire\xe2\x80\x94Chad remarkably\r\nreplied: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if they hate my good friend, _that_ comes to the same\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x9d It had a note of inevitable truth that made Strether take it as\r\nenough, feel he wanted nothing more. The young man spoke in it for his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgood friend\xe2\x80\x9d more than he had ever yet directly spoken, confessed to\r\nsuch deep identities between them as he might play with the idea of\r\nworking free from, but which at a given moment could still draw him\r\ndown like a whirlpool. And meanwhile he had gone on. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir hating you\r\ntoo moreover\xe2\x80\x94that also comes to a good deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cyour mother doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad, however, loyally stuck to it\xe2\x80\x94loyally, that is, to Strether. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nwill if you don\xe2\x80\x99t look out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I do look out. I am, after all, looking out. That\xe2\x80\x99s just why,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nour friend explained, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to see her again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt drew from Chad again the same question. \xe2\x80\x9cTo see Mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo see\xe2\x80\x94for the present\xe2\x80\x94Sarah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh then there you are! And what I don\xe2\x80\x99t for the life of me make out,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nChad pursued with resigned perplexity, \xe2\x80\x9cis what you _gain_ by it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh it would have taken his companion too long to say! \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s because\r\nyou have, I verily believe, no imagination. You\xe2\x80\x99ve other qualities. But\r\nno imagination, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say. I do see.\xe2\x80\x9d It was an idea in which Chad showed interest.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut haven\xe2\x80\x99t you yourself rather too much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh _rather_\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d So that after an instant, under this reproach and as if\r\nit were at last a fact really to escape from, Strether made his move\r\nfor departure.\r\n\r\n\r\n II\r\n\r\nOne of the features of the restless afternoon passed by him after Mrs.\r\nPocock\xe2\x80\x99s visit was an hour spent, shortly before dinner, with Maria\r\nGostrey, whom of late, in spite of so sustained a call on his attention\r\nfrom other quarters, he had by no means neglected. And that he was\r\nstill not neglecting her will appear from the fact that he was with her\r\nagain at the same hour on the very morrow\xe2\x80\x94with no less fine a\r\nconsciousness moreover of being able to hold her ear. It continued\r\ninveterately to occur, for that matter, that whenever he had taken one\r\nof his greater turns he came back to where she so faithfully awaited\r\nhim. None of these excursions had on the whole been livelier than the\r\npair of incidents\xe2\x80\x94the fruit of the short interval since his previous\r\nvisit\xe2\x80\x94on which he had now to report to her. He had seen Chad Newsome\r\nlate the night before, and he had had that morning, as a sequel to this\r\nconversation, a second interview with Sarah. \xe2\x80\x9cBut they\xe2\x80\x99re all off,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cat last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt puzzled her a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cAll?\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Newsome with them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh not yet! Sarah and Jim and Mamie. But Waymarsh with them\xe2\x80\x94for Sarah.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s too beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether continued; \xe2\x80\x9cI find I don\xe2\x80\x99t get over\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s always a fresh joy. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a fresh joy too,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x94well, what do you think? Little Bilham also goes. But he of\r\ncourse goes for Mamie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey wondered. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98For\xe2\x80\x99 her? Do you mean they\xe2\x80\x99re already\r\nengaged?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9csay then for _me_. He\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything for me;\r\njust as I will, for that matter\xe2\x80\x94anything I can\xe2\x80\x94for him. Or for Mamie\r\neither. _She\xe2\x80\x99ll_ do anything for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey gave a comprehensive sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cThe way you reduce people to\r\nsubjection!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s certainly, on one side, wonderful. But it\xe2\x80\x99s quite equalled, on\r\nanother, by the way I don\xe2\x80\x99t. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t reduced Sarah, since yesterday;\r\nthough I\xe2\x80\x99ve succeeded in seeing her again, as I\xe2\x80\x99ll presently tell you.\r\nThe others however are really all right. Mamie, by that blessed law of\r\nours, absolutely must have a young man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what must poor Mr. Bilham have? Do you mean they\xe2\x80\x99ll _marry_ for\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that, by the same blessed law, it won\xe2\x80\x99t matter a grain if they\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94I shan\xe2\x80\x99t have in the least to worry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe saw as usual what he meant. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mr. Jim?\xe2\x80\x94who goes for him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether had to admit, \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t manage _that_. He\xe2\x80\x99s thrown, as\r\nusual, on the world; the world which, after all, by his account\xe2\x80\x94for he\r\nhas prodigious adventures\xe2\x80\x94seems very good to him. He fortunately\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98over\r\nhere,\xe2\x80\x99 as he says\xe2\x80\x94finds the world everywhere; and his most prodigious\r\nadventure of all,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9chas been of course of the last few\r\ndays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey, already knowing, instantly made the connexion. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has\r\nseen Marie de Vionnet again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe went, all by himself, the day after Chad\xe2\x80\x99s party\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x94to tea with her. By her invitation\xe2\x80\x94all alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite like yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d Maria smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh but he\xe2\x80\x99s more wonderful about her than I am!\xe2\x80\x9d And then as his\r\nfriend showed how she could believe it, filling it out, fitting it on\r\nto old memories of the wonderful woman: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I should have liked to\r\nmanage would have been _her_ going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Switzerland with the party?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Jim\xe2\x80\x94and for symmetry. If it had been workable moreover for a\r\nfortnight she\xe2\x80\x99d have gone. She\xe2\x80\x99s ready\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he followed up his renewed\r\nvision of her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfor anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey went with him a minute. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s too perfect!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe _will_, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cgo to-night to the station.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo see him off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith Chad\xe2\x80\x94marvellously\xe2\x80\x94as part of their general attention. And she\r\ndoes it\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it kept before him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwith a light, light grace, a free, free\r\ngaiety, that may well softly bewilder Mr. Pocock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt kept her so before him that his companion had after an instant a\r\nfriendly comment. \xe2\x80\x9cAs in short it has softly bewildered a saner man.\r\nAre you really in love with her?\xe2\x80\x9d Maria threw off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s of no importance I should know,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cIt matters so\r\nlittle\xe2\x80\x94has nothing to do, practically, with either of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the same\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Maria continued to smile\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthey go, the five, as I\r\nunderstand you, and you and Madame de Vionnet stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh and Chad.\xe2\x80\x9d To which Strether added: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh \xe2\x80\x98me\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she gave a small impatient wail again, in which something of\r\nthe unreconciled seemed suddenly to break out. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t stay, it\r\nsomehow seems to me, much to my advantage. In the presence of all you\r\ncause to pass before me I\xe2\x80\x99ve a tremendous sense of privation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cBut your privation, your keeping out of\r\neverything, has been\xe2\x80\x94hasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x94by your own choice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes; it has been necessary\xe2\x80\x94that is it has been better for you. What\r\nI mean is only that I seem to have ceased to serve you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you tell that?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you serve me.\r\nWhen you cease\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d she said as he dropped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll _let_ you know. Be quiet till then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe thought a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you positively like me to stay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t I treat you as if I did?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re certainly very kind to me. But that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maria, \xe2\x80\x9cis for\r\nmyself. It\xe2\x80\x99s getting late, as you see, and Paris turning rather hot and\r\ndusty. People are scattering, and some of them, in other places want\r\nme. But if you want me here\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had spoken as resigned to his word, but he had of a sudden a still\r\nsharper sense than he would have expected of desiring not to lose her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took it as if the words were all she had wished; as if they brought\r\nher, gave her something that was the compensation of her case. \xe2\x80\x9cThank\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d she simply answered. And then as he looked at her a little\r\nharder, \xe2\x80\x9cThank you very much,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\nIt had broken as with a slight arrest into the current of their talk,\r\nand it held him a moment longer. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, two months, or whatever the time\r\nwas, ago, did you so suddenly dash off? The reason you afterwards gave\r\nme for having kept away three weeks wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the real one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe recalled. \xe2\x80\x9cI never supposed you believed it was. Yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cif you didn\xe2\x80\x99t guess it that was just what helped you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked away from her on this; he indulged, so far as space\r\npermitted, in one of his slow absences. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve often thought of it, but\r\nnever to feel that I could guess it. And you see the consideration with\r\nwhich I\xe2\x80\x99ve treated you in never asking till now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then why _do_ you ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo show you how I miss you when you\xe2\x80\x99re not here, and what it does for\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have done,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed, \xe2\x80\x9call it might! However,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe added, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99ve really never guessed the truth I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell it you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never guessed it,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then I dashed off, as you say, so as not to have the confusion of\r\nbeing there if Marie de Vionnet should tell you anything to my\r\ndetriment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked as if he considerably doubted. \xe2\x80\x9cYou even then would have had\r\nto face it on your return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh if I had found reason to believe it something very bad I\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\nleft you altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo then,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cit was only on guessing she had been on the\r\nwhole merciful that you ventured back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaria kept it together. \xe2\x80\x9cI owe her thanks. Whatever her temptation she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t separate us. That\xe2\x80\x99s one of my reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nadmiring her so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it pass then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cfor one of mine as well. But what\r\nwould have been her temptation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are ever the temptations of women?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thought\xe2\x80\x94but hadn\xe2\x80\x99t, naturally, to think too long. \xe2\x80\x9cMen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe would have had you, with it, more for herself. But she saw she\r\ncould have you without it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh \xe2\x80\x98have\xe2\x80\x99 me!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether a trifle ambiguously sighed. \xe2\x80\x9c_You_,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nhandsomely declared, \xe2\x80\x9cwould have had me at any rate _with_ it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh \xe2\x80\x98have\xe2\x80\x99 you!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she echoed it as he had done. \xe2\x80\x9cI do have you,\r\nhowever,\xe2\x80\x9d she less ironically said, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the moment you express a\r\nwish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped before her, full of the disposition. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll express fifty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhich indeed begot in her, with a certain inconsequence, a return of\r\nher small wail. \xe2\x80\x9cAh there you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere, if it were so, he continued for the rest of the time to be, and\r\nit was as if to show her how she could still serve him that, coming\r\nback to the departure of the Pococks, he gave her the view, vivid with\r\na hundred more touches than we can reproduce, of what had happened for\r\nhim that morning. He had had ten minutes with Sarah at her hotel, ten\r\nminutes reconquered, by irresistible pressure, from the time over which\r\nhe had already described her to Miss Gostrey as having, at the end of\r\ntheir interview on his own premises, passed the great sponge of the\r\nfuture. He had caught her by not announcing himself, had found her in\r\nher sitting-room with a dressmaker and a _ling\xc3\xa8re_ whose accounts she\r\nappeared to have been more or less ingenuously settling and who soon\r\nwithdrew. Then he had explained to her how he had succeeded, late the\r\nnight before, in keeping his promise of seeing Chad. \xe2\x80\x9cI told her I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ntake it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x98take\xe2\x80\x99 it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaria waited. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd who takes it if he does?\xe2\x80\x9d she enquired with a\r\ncertain grimness of gaiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I take, in any event, everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy which I suppose you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d his companion brought out after a\r\nmoment, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you definitely understand you now lose everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood before her again. \xe2\x80\x9cIt does come perhaps to the same thing. But\r\nChad, now that he has seen, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really want it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could believe that, but she made, as always, for clearness. \xe2\x80\x9cStill,\r\nwhat, after all, _has_ he seen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat they want of him. And it\xe2\x80\x99s enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt contrasts so unfavourably with what Madame de Vionnet wants?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt contrasts\xe2\x80\x94just so; all round, and tremendously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore, perhaps, most of all with what _you_ want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat I want is a thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve ceased to measure or\r\neven to understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut his friend none the less went on. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x94after\r\nsuch a way of treating you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a straighter mode of dealing with this lady than they had as\r\nyet\xe2\x80\x94such was their high form\xe2\x80\x94permitted themselves; but it seemed not\r\nwholly for this that he delayed a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say it has been,\r\nafter all, the only way she could have imagined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd does that make you want her any more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve tremendously disappointed her,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether thought it worth while\r\nto mention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you have. That\xe2\x80\x99s rudimentary; that was plain to us long ago.\r\nBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t it almost as plain,\xe2\x80\x9d Maria went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\xe2\x80\x99ve even yet\r\nyour straight remedy? Really drag him away, as I believe you still can,\r\nand you\xe2\x80\x99d cease to have to count with her disappointment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh then,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cI should have to count with yours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut this barely struck her now. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, in that case, should you call\r\ncounting? You haven\xe2\x80\x99t come out where you are, I think, to please _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d he insisted, \xe2\x80\x9cthat too, you know, has been part of it. I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseparate\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s all one; and that\xe2\x80\x99s perhaps why, as I say, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand.\xe2\x80\x9d But he was ready to declare again that this didn\xe2\x80\x99t in the\r\nleast matter; all the more that, as he affirmed, he _hadn\xe2\x80\x99t_ really as\r\nyet \xe2\x80\x9ccome out.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cShe gives me after all, on its coming to the pinch, a\r\nlast mercy, another chance. They don\xe2\x80\x99t sail, you see, for five or six\r\nweeks more, and they haven\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94she admits that\xe2\x80\x94expected Chad would take\r\npart in their tour. It\xe2\x80\x99s still open to him to join them, at the last,\r\nat Liverpool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey considered. \xe2\x80\x9cHow in the world is it \xe2\x80\x98open\xe2\x80\x99 unless you open\r\nit? How can he join them at Liverpool if he but sinks deeper into his\r\nsituation here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has given her\xe2\x80\x94as I explained to you that she let me know\r\nyesterday\xe2\x80\x94his word of honour to do as I say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaria stared. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if you say nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, he as usual walked about on it. \xe2\x80\x9cI did say something this\r\nmorning. I gave her my answer\xe2\x80\x94the word I had promised her after hearing\r\nfrom himself what _he_ had promised. What she demanded of me yesterday,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll remember, was the engagement then and there to make him take up\r\nthis vow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Gostrey enquired, \xe2\x80\x9cwas the purpose of your visit to\r\nher only to decline?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; it was to ask, odd as that may seem to you, for another delay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh that\xe2\x80\x99s weak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely!\xe2\x80\x9d She had spoken with impatience, but, so far as that at\r\nleast, he knew where he was. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I _am_ weak I want to find it out. If\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t find it out I shall have the comfort, the little glory, of\r\nthinking I\xe2\x80\x99m strong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all the comfort, I judge,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you _will_ have!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit will have been a month more. Paris may\r\ngrow, from day to day, hot and dusty, as you say; but there are other\r\nthings that are hotter and dustier. I\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid to stay on; the\r\nsummer here must be amusing in a wild\xe2\x80\x94if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a tame\xe2\x80\x94way of its\r\nown; the place at no time more picturesque. I think I shall like it.\r\nAnd then,\xe2\x80\x9d he benevolently smiled for her, \xe2\x80\x9cthere will be always you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she objected, \xe2\x80\x9cit won\xe2\x80\x99t be as a part of the picturesqueness that\r\nI shall stay, for I shall be the plainest thing about you. You may, you\r\nsee, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d she pursued, \xe2\x80\x9chave nobody else. Madame de Vionnet\r\nmay very well be going off, mayn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x94and Mr. Newsome by the same\r\nstroke: unless indeed you\xe2\x80\x99ve had an assurance from them to the\r\ncontrary. So that if your idea\xe2\x80\x99s to stay for them\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it was her duty to\r\nsuggest it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou may be left in the lurch. Of course if they do\r\nstay\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she kept it up\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthey would be part of the picturesqueness. Or\r\nelse indeed you might join them somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether seemed to face it as if it were a happy thought; but the next\r\nmoment he spoke more critically. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean that they\xe2\x80\x99ll probably go\r\noff together?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe just considered. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it will be treating you quite without\r\nceremony if they do; though after all,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cit would be\r\ndifficult to see now quite what degree of ceremony properly meets your\r\ncase.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether conceded, \xe2\x80\x9cmy attitude toward them is\r\nextraordinary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so; so that one may ask one\xe2\x80\x99s self what style of proceeding on\r\ntheir own part can altogether match it. The attitude of their own that\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t pale in its light they\xe2\x80\x99ve doubtless still to work out. The really\r\nhandsome thing perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d she presently threw off, \xe2\x80\x9c_would_ be for them\r\nto withdraw into more secluded conditions, offering at the same time to\r\nshare them with you.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at her, on this, as if some generous\r\nirritation\xe2\x80\x94all in his interest\xe2\x80\x94had suddenly again flickered in her; and\r\nwhat she next said indeed half-explained it. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t really be afraid to\r\ntell me if what now holds you _is_ the pleasant prospect of the empty\r\ntown, with plenty of seats in the shade, cool drinks, deserted museums,\r\ndrives to the Bois in the evening, and our wonderful woman all to\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d And she kept it up still more. \xe2\x80\x9cThe handsomest thing of\r\n_all_, when one makes it out, would, I dare say, be that Mr. Chad\r\nshould for a while go off by himself. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pity, from that point of\r\nview,\xe2\x80\x9d she wound up, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pay his mother a visit. It would\r\nat least occupy your interval.\xe2\x80\x9d The thought in fact held her a moment.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he pay his mother a visit? Even a week, at this good\r\nmoment, would do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear lady,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether replied\xe2\x80\x94and he had it even to himself\r\nsurprisingly ready\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmy dear lady, his mother has paid _him_ a visit.\r\nMrs. Newsome has been with him, this month, with an intensity that I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure he has thoroughly felt; he has lavishly entertained her, and she\r\nhas let him have her thanks. Do you suggest he shall go back for more\r\nof them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, she succeeded after a little in shaking it off. \xe2\x80\x9cI see. It\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t suggest\xe2\x80\x94what you haven\xe2\x80\x99t suggested. And you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo would you, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he kindly said, \xe2\x80\x9cif you had so much as seen\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs seen Mrs. Newsome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sarah\xe2\x80\x94which, both for Chad and for myself, has served all the\r\npurpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd served it in a manner,\xe2\x80\x9d she responsively mused, \xe2\x80\x9cso\r\nextraordinary!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d he partly explained, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat it comes to is that she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall cold thought\xe2\x80\x94which Sarah could serve to us cold without its really\r\nlosing anything. So it is that we know what she thinks of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaria had followed, but she had an arrest. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I\xe2\x80\x99ve never made out,\r\nif you come to that, is what you think\xe2\x80\x94I mean you personally\xe2\x80\x94of _her_.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you so much, when all\xe2\x80\x99s said, as care a little?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered with no loss of promptness, \xe2\x80\x9cis what even Chad\r\nhimself asked me last night. He asked me if I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the loss\xe2\x80\x94well,\r\nthe loss of an opulent future. Which moreover,\xe2\x80\x9d he hastened to add,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwas a perfectly natural question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI call your attention, all the same,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Gostrey, \xe2\x80\x9cto the fact\r\nthat I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask it. What I venture to ask is whether it\xe2\x80\x99s to Mrs.\r\nNewsome herself that you\xe2\x80\x99re indifferent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t been so\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he spoke with all assurance. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been the very\r\nopposite. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been, from the first moment, preoccupied with the\r\nimpression everything might be making on her\xe2\x80\x94quite oppressed, haunted,\r\ntormented by it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been interested _only_ in her seeing what I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nseen. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve been as disappointed in her refusal to see it as she has\r\nbeen in what has appeared to her the perversity of my insistence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean that she has shocked you as you\xe2\x80\x99ve shocked her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether weighed it. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m probably not so shockable. But on the other\r\nhand I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone much further to meet her. She, on her side, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbudged an inch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that you\xe2\x80\x99re now at last\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Maria pointed the moral\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cin the sad stage\r\nof recriminations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s only to you I speak. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been like a lamb to Sarah. I\xe2\x80\x99ve only\r\nput my back to the wall. It\xe2\x80\x99s to _that_ one naturally staggers when one\r\nhas been violently pushed there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe watched him a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cThrown over?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, as I feel I\xe2\x80\x99ve landed somewhere I think I must have been\r\nthrown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned it over, but as hoping to clarify much rather than to\r\nharmonise. \xe2\x80\x9cThe thing is that I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ve been disappointing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite from the very first of my arrival? I dare say. I admit I was\r\nsurprising even to myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then of course,\xe2\x80\x9d Maria went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI had much to do with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith my being surprising\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99re too delicate to call it _my_\r\nbeing! Naturally,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cyou came over more or less for\r\nsurprises.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaturally!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he valued the reminder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they were to have been all for you\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she continued to piece it\r\nout\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand none of them for _her_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more he stopped before her as if she had touched the point.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just her difficulty\xe2\x80\x94that she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t admit surprises. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nfact that, I think, describes and represents her; and it falls in with\r\nwhat I tell you\xe2\x80\x94that she\xe2\x80\x99s all, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve called it, fine cold thought.\r\nShe had, to her own mind, worked the whole thing out in advance, and\r\nworked it out for me as well as for herself. Whenever she has done\r\nthat, you see, there\xe2\x80\x99s no room left; no margin, as it were, for any\r\nalteration. She\xe2\x80\x99s filled as full, packed as tight, as she\xe2\x80\x99ll hold and\r\nif you wish to get anything more or different either out or in\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to make over altogether the woman herself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat it comes to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cis that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got morally and\r\nintellectually to get rid of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich would appear,\xe2\x80\x9d Maria returned, \xe2\x80\x9cto be practically what you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ndone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut her friend threw back his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t touched her. She won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n_be_ touched. I see it now as I\xe2\x80\x99ve never done; and she hangs together\r\nwith a perfection of her own,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat does suggest a kind of\r\nwrong in _any_ change of her composition. It was at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d he wound\r\nup, \xe2\x80\x9cthe woman herself, as you call her the whole moral and\r\nintellectual being or block, that Sarah brought me over to take or to\r\nleave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt turned Miss Gostrey to deeper thought. \xe2\x80\x9cFancy having to take at the\r\npoint of the bayonet a whole moral and intellectual being or block!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was in fact,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat, at home, I _had_ done. But\r\nsomehow over there I didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne never does, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Gostrey concurred, \xe2\x80\x9crealise in\r\nadvance, in such a case, the size, as you may say, of the block. Little\r\nby little it looms up. It has been looming for you more and more till\r\nat last you see it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see it all,\xe2\x80\x9d he absently echoed, while his eyes might have been\r\nfixing some particularly large iceberg in a cool blue northern sea.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s magnificent!\xe2\x80\x9d he then rather oddly exclaimed.\r\n\r\nBut his friend, who was used to this kind of inconsequence in him, kept\r\nthe thread. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing so magnificent\xe2\x80\x94for making others feel\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94as to have no imagination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt brought him straight round. \xe2\x80\x9cAh there you are! It\xe2\x80\x99s what I said last\r\nnight to Chad. That he himself, I mean, has none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it would appear,\xe2\x80\x9d Maria suggested, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he has, after all,\r\nsomething in common with his mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has in common that he makes one, as you say, \xe2\x80\x98feel\xe2\x80\x99 him. And yet,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe added, as if the question were interesting, \xe2\x80\x9cone feels others too,\r\neven when they have plenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gostrey continued suggestive. \xe2\x80\x9cMadame de Vionnet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_She_ has plenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly\xe2\x80\x94she had quantities of old. But there are different ways of\r\nmaking one\xe2\x80\x99s self felt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it comes, no doubt, to that. You now\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was benevolently going on, but she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have it. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I _don\xe2\x80\x99t_\r\nmake myself felt; so my quantity needn\xe2\x80\x99t be settled. Yours, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said, \xe2\x80\x9cis monstrous. No one has ever had so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt struck him for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what Chad also thinks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere _you_ are then\xe2\x80\x94though it isn\xe2\x80\x99t for him to complain of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t complain of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all that would be wanting! But apropos of what,\xe2\x80\x9d Maria went on,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdid the question come up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of his asking me what it is I gain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cThen as I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked you too it settles _my_ case. Oh\r\nyou _have_,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, \xe2\x80\x9ctreasures of imagination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he had been for an instant thinking away from this, and he came up\r\nin another place. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a thing to remember\xe2\x80\x94_has_\r\nimagined, did, that is, imagine, and apparently still does, horrors\r\nabout what I should have found. I was booked, by her\r\nvision\xe2\x80\x94extraordinarily intense, after all\xe2\x80\x94to find them; and that I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t, that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, that, as she evidently felt, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94this\r\nevidently didn\xe2\x80\x99t at all, as they say, \xe2\x80\x98suit\xe2\x80\x99 her book. It was more than\r\nshe could bear. That was her disappointment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean you were to have found Chad himself horrible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was to have found the woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorrible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFound her as she imagined her.\xe2\x80\x9d And Strether paused as if for his own\r\nexpression of it he could add no touch to that picture.\r\n\r\nHis companion had meanwhile thought. \xe2\x80\x9cShe imagined stupidly\xe2\x80\x94so it comes\r\nto the same thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStupidly? Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether.\r\n\r\nBut she insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cShe imagined meanly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had it, however, better. \xe2\x80\x9cIt couldn\xe2\x80\x99t but be ignorantly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, intensity with ignorance\xe2\x80\x94what do you want worse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis question might have held him, but he let it pass. \xe2\x80\x9cSarah isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nignorant\xe2\x80\x94now; she keeps up the theory of the horrible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but she\xe2\x80\x99s intense\xe2\x80\x94and that by itself will do sometimes as well. If\r\nit doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do, in this case, at any rate, to deny that Marie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharming, it will do at least to deny that she\xe2\x80\x99s good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I claim is that she\xe2\x80\x99s good for Chad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t claim\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she seemed to like it clear\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat she\xe2\x80\x99s good for\r\n_you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he continued without heeding. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I wanted them to come\r\nout for\xe2\x80\x94to see for themselves if she\xe2\x80\x99s bad for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now that they\xe2\x80\x99ve done so they won\xe2\x80\x99t admit that she\xe2\x80\x99s good even for\r\nanything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey do think,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether presently admitted, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she\xe2\x80\x99s on the whole\r\nabout as bad for me. But they\xe2\x80\x99re consistent of course, inasmuch as\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve their clear view of what\xe2\x80\x99s good for both of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor you, to begin with\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Maria, all responsive, confined the question\r\nfor the moment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto eliminate from your existence and if possible even\r\nfrom your memory the dreadful creature that _I_ must gruesomely shadow\r\nforth for them, even more than to eliminate the distincter evil\xe2\x80\x94thereby\r\na little less portentous\xe2\x80\x94of the person whose confederate you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nsuffered yourself to become. However, that\xe2\x80\x99s comparatively simple. You\r\ncan easily, at the worst, after all, give me up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can easily at the worst, after all, give you up.\xe2\x80\x9d The irony was so\r\nobvious that it needed no care. \xe2\x80\x9cI can easily at the worst, after all,\r\neven forget you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall that then workable. But Mr. Newsome has much more to forget. How\r\ncan _he_ do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh there again we are! That\xe2\x80\x99s just what I was to have made him do;\r\njust where I was to have worked with him and helped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took it in silence and without attenuation\xe2\x80\x94as if perhaps from very\r\nfamiliarity with the facts; and her thought made a connexion without\r\nshowing the links. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember how we used to talk at Chester and\r\nin London about my seeing you through?\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke as of far-off things\r\nand as if they had spent weeks at the places she named.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just what you _are_ doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but the worst\xe2\x80\x94since you\xe2\x80\x99ve left such a margin\xe2\x80\x94may be still to come.\r\nYou may yet break down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I may yet break down. But will you take me\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had hesitated, and she waited. \xe2\x80\x9cTake you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor as long as I can bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe also debated \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Newsome and Madame de Vionnet may, as we were\r\nsaying, leave town. How long do you think you can bear it without\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s reply to this was at first another question. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean in\r\norder to get away from me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer answer had an abruptness. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t find me rude if I say I should\r\nthink they\xe2\x80\x99d want to!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her hard again\xe2\x80\x94seemed even for an instant to have an\r\nintensity of thought under which his colour changed. But he smiled.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean after what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter what _she_ has.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this, however, with a laugh, he was all right again. \xe2\x80\x9cAh but she\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t done it yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n III\r\n\r\nHe had taken the train a few days after this from a station\xe2\x80\x94as well as\r\n_to_ a station\xe2\x80\x94selected almost at random; such days, whatever should\r\nhappen, were numbered, and he had gone forth under the impulse\xe2\x80\x94artless\r\nenough, no doubt\xe2\x80\x94to give the whole of one of them to that French\r\nruralism, with its cool special green, into which he had hitherto\r\nlooked only through the little oblong window of the picture-frame. It\r\nhad been as yet for the most part but a land of fancy for him\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nbackground of fiction, the medium of art, the nursery of letters;\r\npractically as distant as Greece, but practically also well-nigh as\r\nconsecrated. Romance could weave itself, for Strether\xe2\x80\x99s sense, out of\r\nelements mild enough; and even after what he had, as he felt, lately\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbeen through,\xe2\x80\x9d he could thrill a little at the chance of seeing\r\nsomething somewhere that would remind him of a certain small Lambinet\r\nthat had charmed him, long years before, at a Boston dealer\xe2\x80\x99s and that\r\nhe had quite absurdly never forgotten. It had been offered, he\r\nremembered, at a price he had been instructed to believe the lowest\r\never named for a Lambinet, a price he had never felt so poor as on\r\nhaving to recognise, all the same, as beyond a dream of possibility. He\r\nhad dreamed\xe2\x80\x94had turned and twisted possibilities for an hour: it had\r\nbeen the only adventure of his life in connexion with the purchase of a\r\nwork of art. The adventure, it will be perceived, was modest; but the\r\nmemory, beyond all reason and by some accident of association, was\r\nsweet. The little Lambinet abode with him as the picture he _would_\r\nhave bought\xe2\x80\x94the particular production that had made him for the moment\r\noverstep the modesty of nature. He was quite aware that if he were to\r\nsee it again he should perhaps have a drop or a shock, and he never\r\nfound himself wishing that the wheel of time would turn it up again,\r\njust as he had seen it in the maroon-coloured, sky-lighted inner shrine\r\nof Tremont Street. It would be a different thing, however, to see the\r\nremembered mixture resolved back into its elements\xe2\x80\x94to assist at the\r\nrestoration to nature of the whole far-away hour: the dusty day in\r\nBoston, the background of the Fitchburg Depot, of the maroon-coloured\r\nsanctum, the special-green vision, the ridiculous price, the poplars,\r\nthe willows, the rushes, the river, the sunny silvery sky, the shady\r\nwoody horizon.\r\n\r\nHe observed in respect to his train almost no condition save that it\r\nshould stop a few times after getting out of the _banlieue_; he threw\r\nhimself on the general amiability of the day for the hint of where to\r\nalight. His theory of his excursion was that he could alight\r\nanywhere\xe2\x80\x94not nearer Paris than an hour\xe2\x80\x99s run\xe2\x80\x94on catching a suggestion\r\nof the particular note required. It made its sign, the\r\nsuggestion\xe2\x80\x94weather, air, light, colour and his mood all favouring\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nthe end of some eighty minutes; the train pulled up just at the right\r\nspot, and he found himself getting out as securely as if to keep an\r\nappointment. It will be felt of him that he could amuse himself, at his\r\nage, with very small things if it be again noted that his appointment\r\nwas only with a superseded Boston fashion. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t gone far without\r\nthe quick confidence that it would be quite sufficiently kept. The\r\noblong gilt frame disposed its enclosing lines; the poplars and\r\nwillows, the reeds and river\xe2\x80\x94a river of which he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know, and\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t want to know, the name\xe2\x80\x94fell into a composition, full of\r\nfelicity, within them; the sky was silver and turquoise and varnish;\r\nthe village on the left was white and the church on the right was grey;\r\nit was all there, in short\xe2\x80\x94it was what he wanted: it was Tremont\r\nStreet, it was France, it was Lambinet. Moreover he was freely walking\r\nabout in it. He did this last, for an hour, to his heart\xe2\x80\x99s content,\r\nmaking for the shady woody horizon and boring so deep into his\r\nimpression and his idleness that he might fairly have got through them\r\nagain and reached the maroon-coloured wall. It was a wonder, no doubt,\r\nthat the taste of idleness for him shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t need more time to sweeten;\r\nbut it had in fact taken the few previous days; it had been sweetening\r\nin truth ever since the retreat of the Pococks. He walked and walked as\r\nif to show himself how little he had now to do; he had nothing to do\r\nbut turn off to some hillside where he might stretch himself and hear\r\nthe poplars rustle, and whence\xe2\x80\x94in the course of an afternoon so spent,\r\nan afternoon richly suffused too with the sense of a book in his\r\npocket\xe2\x80\x94he should sufficiently command the scene to be able to pick out\r\njust the right little rustic inn for an experiment in respect to\r\ndinner. There was a train back to Paris at 9.20, and he saw himself\r\npartaking, at the close of the day, with the enhancements of a coarse\r\nwhite cloth and a sanded door, of something fried and felicitous,\r\nwashed down with authentic wine; after which he might, as he liked,\r\neither stroll back to his station in the gloaming or propose for the\r\nlocal _carriole_ and converse with his driver, a driver who naturally\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t fail of a stiff clean blouse, of a knitted nightcap and of the\r\ngenius of response\xe2\x80\x94who, in fine, would sit on the shafts, tell him what\r\nthe French people were thinking, and remind him, as indeed the whole\r\nepisode would incidentally do, of Maupassant. Strether heard his lips,\r\nfor the first time in French air, as this vision assumed consistency,\r\nemit sounds of expressive intention without fear of his company. He had\r\nbeen afraid of Chad and of Maria and of Madame de Vionnet; he had been\r\nmost of all afraid of Waymarsh, in whose presence, so far as they had\r\nmixed together in the light of the town, he had never without somehow\r\npaying for it aired either his vocabulary or his accent. He usually\r\npaid for it by meeting immediately afterwards Waymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s eye.\r\n\r\nSuch were the liberties with which his fancy played after he had turned\r\noff to the hillside that did really and truly, as well as most amiably,\r\nawait him beneath the poplars, the hillside that made him feel, for a\r\nmurmurous couple of hours, how happy had been his thought. He had the\r\nsense of success, of a finer harmony in things; nothing but what had\r\nturned out as yet according to his plan. It most of all came home to\r\nhim, as he lay on his back on the grass, that Sarah had really gone,\r\nthat his tension was really relaxed; the peace diffused in these ideas\r\nmight be delusive, but it hung about him none the less for the time. It\r\nfairly, for half an hour, sent him to sleep; he pulled his straw hat\r\nover his eyes\xe2\x80\x94he had bought it the day before with a reminiscence of\r\nWaymarsh\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94and lost himself anew in Lambinet. It was as if he had found\r\nout he was tired\xe2\x80\x94tired not from his walk, but from that inward exercise\r\nwhich had known, on the whole, for three months, so little\r\nintermission. That was it\xe2\x80\x94when once they were off he had dropped; this\r\nmoreover was what he had dropped to, and now he was touching bottom. He\r\nwas kept luxuriously quiet, soothed and amused by the consciousness of\r\nwhat he had found at the end of his descent. It was very much what he\r\nhad told Maria Gostrey he should like to stay on for, the\r\nhugely-distributed Paris of summer, alternately dazzling and dusky,\r\nwith a weight lifted for him off its columns and cornices and with\r\nshade and air in the flutter of awnings as wide as avenues. It was\r\npresent to him without attenuation that, reaching out, the day after\r\nmaking the remark, for some proof of his freedom, he had gone that very\r\nafternoon to see Madame de Vionnet. He had gone again the next day but\r\none, and the effect of the two visits, the after-sense of the couple of\r\nhours spent with her, was almost that of fulness and frequency. The\r\nbrave intention of frequency, so great with him from the moment of his\r\nfinding himself unjustly suspected at Woollett, had remained rather\r\ntheoretic, and one of the things he could muse about under his poplars\r\nwas the source of the special shyness that had still made him careful.\r\nHe had surely got rid of it now, this special shyness; what had become\r\nof it if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t precisely, within the week, rubbed off?\r\n\r\nIt struck him now in fact as sufficiently plain that if he had still\r\nbeen careful he had been so for a reason. He had really feared, in his\r\nbehaviour, a lapse from good faith; if there was a danger of one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nliking such a woman too much one\xe2\x80\x99s best safety was in waiting at least\r\ntill one had the right to do so. In the light of the last few days the\r\ndanger was fairly vivid; so that it was proportionately fortunate that\r\nthe right was likewise established. It seemed to our friend that he had\r\non each occasion profited to the utmost by the latter: how could he\r\nhave done so more, he at all events asked himself, than in having\r\nimmediately let her know that, if it was all the same to her, he\r\npreferred not to talk about anything tiresome? He had never in his life\r\nso sacrificed an armful of high interests as in that remark; he had\r\nnever so prepared the way for the comparatively frivolous as in\r\naddressing it to Madame de Vionnet\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence. It hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been till\r\nlater that he quite recalled how in conjuring away everything but the\r\npleasant he had conjured away almost all they had hitherto talked\r\nabout; it was not till later even that he remembered how, with their\r\nnew tone, they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t so much as mentioned the name of Chad himself.\r\nOne of the things that most lingered with him on his hillside was this\r\ndelightful facility, with such a woman, of arriving at a new tone; he\r\nthought, as he lay on his back, of all the tones she might make\r\npossible if one were to try her, and at any rate of the probability\r\nthat one could trust her to fit them to occasions. He had wanted her to\r\nfeel that, as he was disinterested now, so she herself should be, and\r\nshe had showed she felt it, and he had showed he was grateful, and it\r\nhad been for all the world as if he were calling for the first time.\r\nThey had had other, but irrelevant, meetings; it was quite as if, had\r\nthey sooner known how much they _really_ had in common, there were\r\nquantities of comparatively dull matters they might have skipped. Well,\r\nthey were skipping them now, even to graceful gratitude, even to\r\nhandsome \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mention it!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and it was amazing what could still come\r\nup without reference to what had been going on between them. It might\r\nhave been, on analysis, nothing more than Shakespeare and the musical\r\nglasses; but it had served all the purpose of his appearing to have\r\nsaid to her: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t like me, if it\xe2\x80\x99s a question of liking me, for\r\nanything obvious and clumsy that I\xe2\x80\x99ve, as they call it, \xe2\x80\x98done\xe2\x80\x99 for you:\r\nlike me\xe2\x80\x94well, like me, hang it, for anything else you choose. So, by\r\nthe same propriety, don\xe2\x80\x99t be for me simply the person I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to know\r\nthrough my awkward connexion with Chad\xe2\x80\x94was ever anything, by the way,\r\n_more_ awkward? Be for me, please, with all your admirable tact and\r\ntrust, just whatever I may show you it\xe2\x80\x99s a present pleasure to me to\r\nthink you.\xe2\x80\x9d It had been a large indication to meet; but if she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmet it what _had_ she done, and how had their time together slipped\r\nalong so smoothly, mild but not slow, and melting, liquefying, into his\r\nhappy illusion of idleness? He could recognise on the other hand that\r\nhe had probably not been without reason, in his prior, his restricted\r\nstate, for keeping an eye on his liability to lapse from good faith.\r\n\r\nHe really continued in the picture\xe2\x80\x94that being for himself his\r\nsituation\xe2\x80\x94all the rest of this rambling day; so that the charm was\r\nstill, was indeed more than ever upon him when, toward six o\xe2\x80\x99clock he\r\nfound himself amicably engaged with a stout white-capped deep-voiced\r\nwoman at the door of the _auberge_ of the biggest village, a village\r\nthat affected him as a thing of whiteness, blueness and crookedness,\r\nset in coppery green, and that had the river flowing behind or before\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say which; at the bottom, in particular, of the\r\ninn-garden. He had had other adventures before this; had kept along the\r\nheight, after shaking off slumber; had admired, had almost coveted,\r\nanother small old church, all steep roof and dim slate-colour without\r\nand all whitewash and paper flowers within; had lost his way and had\r\nfound it again; had conversed with rustics who struck him perhaps a\r\nlittle more as men of the world than he had expected; had acquired at a\r\nbound a fearless facility in French; had had, as the afternoon waned, a\r\nwatery _bock_, all pale and Parisian, in the caf\xc3\xa9 of the furthest\r\nvillage, which was not the biggest; and had meanwhile not once\r\noverstepped the oblong gilt frame. The frame had drawn itself out for\r\nhim, as much as you please; but that was just his luck. He had finally\r\ncome down again to the valley, to keep within touch of stations and\r\ntrains, turning his face to the quarter from which he had started; and\r\nthus it was that he had at last pulled up before the hostess of the\r\nCheval Blanc, who met him, with a rough readiness that was like the\r\nclatter of sabots over stones, on their common ground of a _c\xc3\xb4telette\r\nde veau \xc3\xa0 l\xe2\x80\x99oseille_ and a subsequent lift. He had walked many miles\r\nand didn\xe2\x80\x99t know he was tired; but he still knew he was amused, and even\r\nthat, though he had been alone all day, he had never yet so struck\r\nhimself as engaged with others and in midstream of his drama. It might\r\nhave passed for finished his drama, with its catastrophe all but\r\nreached: it had, however, none the less been vivid again for him as he\r\nthus gave it its fuller chance. He had only had to be at last well out\r\nof it to feel it, oddly enough, still going on.\r\n\r\nFor this had been all day at bottom the spell of the picture\xe2\x80\x94that it\r\nwas essentially more than anything else a scene and a stage, that the\r\nvery air of the play was in the rustle of the willows and the tone of\r\nthe sky. The play and the characters had, without his knowing it till\r\nnow, peopled all his space for him, and it seemed somehow quite happy\r\nthat they should offer themselves, in the conditions so supplied, with\r\na kind of inevitability. It was as if the conditions made them not only\r\ninevitable, but so much more nearly natural and right as that they were\r\nat least easier, pleasanter, to put up with. The conditions had nowhere\r\nso asserted their difference from those of Woollett as they appeared to\r\nhim to assert it in the little court of the Cheval Blanc while he\r\narranged with his hostess for a comfortable climax. They were few and\r\nsimple, scant and humble, but they were _the thing_, as he would have\r\ncalled it, even to a greater degree than Madame de Vionnet\xe2\x80\x99s old high\r\nsalon where the ghost of the Empire walked. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\xe2\x80\x9d thing was the thing\r\nthat implied the greatest number of other things of the sort he had had\r\nto tackle; and it was queer of course, but so it was\xe2\x80\x94the implication\r\nhere was complete. Not a single one of his observations but somehow\r\nfell into a place in it; not a breath of the cooler evening that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsomehow a syllable of the text. The text was simply, when condensed,\r\nthat in _these_ places such things were, and that if it was in them one\r\nelected to move about one had to make one\xe2\x80\x99s account with what one\r\nlighted on. Meanwhile at all events it was enough that they did affect\r\none\xe2\x80\x94so far as the village aspect was concerned\xe2\x80\x94as whiteness,\r\ncrookedness and blueness set in coppery green; there being positively,\r\nfor that matter, an outer wall of the White Horse that was painted the\r\nmost improbable shade. That was part of the amusement\xe2\x80\x94as if to show\r\nthat the fun was harmless; just as it was enough, further, that the\r\npicture and the play seemed supremely to melt together in the good\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s broad sketch of what she could do for her visitor\xe2\x80\x99s appetite.\r\nHe felt in short a confidence, and it was general, and it was all he\r\nwanted to feel. It suffered no shock even on her mentioning that she\r\nhad in fact just laid the cloth for two persons who, unlike Monsieur,\r\nhad arrived by the river\xe2\x80\x94in a boat of their own; who had asked her,\r\nhalf an hour before, what she could do for them, and had then paddled\r\naway to look at something a little further up\xe2\x80\x94from which promenade they\r\nwould presently return. Monsieur might meanwhile, if he liked, pass\r\ninto the garden, such as it was, where she would serve him, should he\r\nwish it\xe2\x80\x94for there were tables and benches in plenty\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9cbitter\xe2\x80\x9d before\r\nhis repast. Here she would also report to him on the possibility of a\r\nconveyance to his station, and here at any rate he would have the\r\n_agr\xc3\xa9ment_ of the river.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned without delay that Monsieur had the _agr\xc3\xa9ment_ of\r\neverything, and in particular, for the next twenty minutes, of a small\r\nand primitive pavilion that, at the garden\xe2\x80\x99s edge, almost overhung the\r\nwater, testifying, in its somewhat battered state, to much fond\r\nfrequentation. It consisted of little more than a platform, slightly\r\nraised, with a couple of benches and a table, a protecting rail and a\r\nprojecting roof; but it raked the full grey-blue stream, which, taking\r\na turn a short distance above, passed out of sight to reappear much\r\nhigher up; and it was clearly in esteemed requisition for Sundays and\r\nother feasts. Strether sat there and, though hungry, felt at peace; the\r\nconfidence that had so gathered for him deepened with the lap of the\r\nwater, the ripple of the surface, the rustle of the reeds on the\r\nopposite bank, the faint diffused coolness and the slight rock of a\r\ncouple of small boats attached to a rough landing-place hard by. The\r\nvalley on the further side was all copper-green level and glazed pearly\r\nsky, a sky hatched across with screens of trimmed trees, which looked\r\nflat, like espaliers; and though the rest of the village straggled away\r\nin the near quarter the view had an emptiness that made one of the\r\nboats suggestive. Such a river set one afloat almost before one could\r\ntake up the oars\xe2\x80\x94the idle play of which would be moreover the aid to\r\nthe full impression. This perception went so far as to bring him to his\r\nfeet; but that movement, in turn, made him feel afresh that he was\r\ntired, and while he leaned against a post and continued to look out he\r\nsaw something that gave him a sharper arrest.\r\n\r\n\r\n IV\r\n\r\nWhat he saw was exactly the right thing\xe2\x80\x94a boat advancing round the bend\r\nand containing a man who held the paddles and a lady, at the stern,\r\nwith a pink parasol. It was suddenly as if these figures, or something\r\nlike them, had been wanted in the picture, had been wanted more or less\r\nall day, and had now drifted into sight, with the slow current, on\r\npurpose to fill up the measure. They came slowly, floating down,\r\nevidently directed to the landing-place near their spectator and\r\npresenting themselves to him not less clearly as the two persons for\r\nwhom his hostess was already preparing a meal. For two very happy\r\npersons he found himself straightway taking them\xe2\x80\x94a young man in\r\nshirt-sleeves, a young woman easy and fair, who had pulled pleasantly\r\nup from some other place and, being acquainted with the neighbourhood,\r\nhad known what this particular retreat could offer them. The air quite\r\nthickened, at their approach, with further intimations; the intimation\r\nthat they were expert, familiar, frequent\xe2\x80\x94that this wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t at all\r\nevents be the first time. They knew how to do it, he vaguely felt\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nit made them but the more idyllic, though at the very moment of the\r\nimpression, as happened, their boat seemed to have begun to drift wide,\r\nthe oarsman letting it go. It had by this time none the less come much\r\nnearer\xe2\x80\x94near enough for Strether to dream the lady in the stern had for\r\nsome reason taken account of his being there to watch them. She had\r\nremarked on it sharply, yet her companion hadn\xe2\x80\x99t turned round; it was\r\nin fact almost as if our friend had felt her bid him keep still. She\r\nhad taken in something as a result of which their course had wavered,\r\nand it continued to waver while they just stood off. This little effect\r\nwas sudden and rapid, so rapid that Strether\xe2\x80\x99s sense of it was separate\r\nonly for an instant from a sharp start of his own. He too had within\r\nthe minute taken in something, taken in that he knew the lady whose\r\nparasol, shifting as if to hide her face, made so fine a pink point in\r\nthe shining scene. It was too prodigious, a chance in a million, but,\r\nif he knew the lady, the gentleman, who still presented his back and\r\nkept off, the gentleman, the coatless hero of the idyll, who had\r\nresponded to her start, was, to match the marvel, none other than Chad.\r\n\r\nChad and Madame de Vionnet were then like himself taking a day in the\r\ncountry\xe2\x80\x94though it was as queer as fiction, as farce, that their country\r\ncould happen to be exactly his; and she had been the first at\r\nrecognition, the first to feel, across the water, the shock\xe2\x80\x94for it\r\nappeared to come to that\xe2\x80\x94of their wonderful accident. Strether became\r\naware, with this, of what was taking place\xe2\x80\x94that her recognition had\r\nbeen even stranger for the pair in the boat, that her immediate impulse\r\nhad been to control it, and that she was quickly and intensely debating\r\nwith Chad the risk of betrayal. He saw they would show nothing if they\r\ncould feel sure he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t made them out; so that he had before him for\r\na few seconds his own hesitation. It was a sharp fantastic crisis that\r\nhad popped up as if in a dream, and it had had only to last the few\r\nseconds to make him feel it as quite horrible. They were thus, on\r\neither side, _trying_ the other side, and all for some reason that\r\nbroke the stillness like some unprovoked harsh note. It seemed to him\r\nagain, within the limit, that he had but one thing to do\xe2\x80\x94to settle\r\ntheir common question by some sign of surprise and joy. He hereupon\r\ngave large play to these things, agitating his hat and his stick and\r\nloudly calling out\xe2\x80\x94a demonstration that brought him relief as soon as\r\nhe had seen it answered. The boat, in mid-stream, still went a little\r\nwild\xe2\x80\x94which seemed natural, however, while Chad turned round, half\r\nspringing up; and his good friend, after blankness and wonder, began\r\ngaily to wave her parasol. Chad dropped afresh to his paddles and the\r\nboat headed round, amazement and pleasantry filling the air meanwhile,\r\nand relief, as Strether continued to fancy, superseding mere violence.\r\nOur friend went down to the water under this odd impression as of\r\nviolence averted\xe2\x80\x94the violence of their having \xe2\x80\x9ccut\xe2\x80\x9d him, out there in\r\nthe eye of nature, on the assumption that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know it. He\r\nawaited them with a face from which he was conscious of not being able\r\nquite to banish this idea that they would have gone on, not seeing and\r\nnot knowing, missing their dinner and disappointing their hostess, had\r\nhe himself taken a line to match. That at least was what darkened his\r\nvision for the moment. Afterwards, after they had bumped at the\r\nlanding-place and he had assisted their getting ashore, everything\r\nfound itself sponged over by the mere miracle of the encounter.\r\n\r\nThey could so much better at last, on either side, treat it as a wild\r\nextravagance of hazard, that the situation was made elastic by the\r\namount of explanation called into play. Why indeed\xe2\x80\x94apart from\r\noddity\xe2\x80\x94the situation should have been really stiff was a question\r\nnaturally not practical at the moment, and in fact, so far as we are\r\nconcerned, a question tackled, later on and in private, only by\r\nStrether himself. He was to reflect later on and in private that it was\r\nmainly _he_ who had explained\xe2\x80\x94as he had had moreover comparatively\r\nlittle difficulty in doing. He was to have at all events meanwhile the\r\nworrying thought of their perhaps secretly suspecting him of having\r\nplotted this coincidence, taking such pains as might be to give it the\r\nsemblance of an accident. That possibility\xe2\x80\x94as their imputation\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nof course bear looking into for an instant; yet the whole incident was\r\nso manifestly, arrange it as they would, an awkward one, that he could\r\nscarce keep disclaimers in respect to his own presence from rising to\r\nhis lips. Disclaimers of intention would have been as tactless as his\r\npresence was practically gross; and the narrowest escape they either of\r\nthem had was his lucky escape, in the event, from making any. Nothing\r\nof the sort, so far as surface and sound were involved, was even in\r\nquestion; surface and sound all made for their common ridiculous good\r\nfortune, for the general _invraisemblance_ of the occasion, for the\r\ncharming chance that they had, the others, in passing, ordered some\r\nfood to be ready, the charming chance that he had himself not eaten,\r\nthe charming chance, even more, that their little plans, their hours,\r\ntheir train, in short, from _l\xc3\xa0-bas_, would all match for their return\r\ntogether to Paris. The chance that was most charming of all, the chance\r\nthat drew from Madame de Vionnet her clearest, gayest \xe2\x80\x9c_Comme cela se\r\ntrouve!_\xe2\x80\x9d was the announcement made to Strether after they were seated\r\nat table, the word given him by their hostess in respect to his\r\ncarriage for the station, on which he might now count. It settled the\r\nmatter for his friends as well; the conveyance\xe2\x80\x94it _was_ all too\r\nlucky!\xe2\x80\x94would serve for them; and nothing was more delightful than his\r\nbeing in a position to make the train so definite. It might have been,\r\nfor themselves\xe2\x80\x94to hear Madame de Vionnet\xe2\x80\x94almost unnaturally vague, a\r\ndetail left to be fixed; though Strether indeed was afterwards to\r\nremember that Chad had promptly enough intervened to forestall this\r\nappearance, laughing at his companion\xe2\x80\x99s flightiness and making the\r\npoint that he had after all, in spite of the bedazzlement of a day out\r\nwith her, known what he was about.\r\n\r\nStrether was to remember afterwards further that this had had for him\r\nthe effect of forming Chad\xe2\x80\x99s almost sole intervention; and indeed he\r\nwas to remember further still, in subsequent meditation, many things\r\nthat, as it were, fitted together. Another of them was for instance\r\nthat the wonderful woman\xe2\x80\x99s overflow of surprise and amusement was\r\nwholly into French, which she struck him as speaking with an\r\nunprecedented command of idiomatic turns, but in which she got, as he\r\nmight have said, somewhat away from him, taking all at once little\r\nbrilliant jumps that he could but lamely match. The question of his own\r\nFrench had never come up for them; it was the one thing she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave permitted\xe2\x80\x94it belonged, for a person who had been through much, to\r\nmere boredom; but the present result was odd, fairly veiling her\r\nidentity, shifting her back into a mere voluble class or race to the\r\nintense audibility of which he was by this time inured. When she spoke\r\nthe charming slightly strange English he best knew her by he seemed to\r\nfeel her as a creature, among all the millions, with a language quite\r\nto herself, the real monopoly of a special shade of speech, beautifully\r\neasy for her, yet of a colour and a cadence that were both inimitable\r\nand matters of accident. She came back to these things after they had\r\nshaken down in the inn-parlour and knew, as it were, what was to become\r\nof them; it was inevitable that loud ejaculation over the prodigy of\r\ntheir convergence should at last wear itself out. Then it was that his\r\nimpression took fuller form\xe2\x80\x94the impression, destined only to deepen, to\r\ncomplete itself, that they had something to put a face upon, to carry\r\noff and make the best of, and that it was she who, admirably on the\r\nwhole, was doing this. It was familiar to him of course that they had\r\nsomething to put a face upon; their friendship, their connexion, took\r\nany amount of explaining\xe2\x80\x94that would have been made familiar by his\r\ntwenty minutes with Mrs. Pocock if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t already been so. Yet his\r\ntheory, as we know, had bountifully been that the facts were\r\nspecifically none of his business, and were, over and above, so far as\r\none had to do with them, intrinsically beautiful; and this might have\r\nprepared him for anything, as well as rendered him proof against\r\nmystification. When he reached home that night, however, he knew he had\r\nbeen, at bottom, neither prepared nor proof; and since we have spoken\r\nof what he was, after his return, to recall and interpret, it may as\r\nwell immediately be said that his real experience of these few hours\r\nput on, in that belated vision\xe2\x80\x94for he scarce went to bed till\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x94the aspect that is most to our purpose.\r\n\r\nHe then knew more or less how he had been affected\xe2\x80\x94he but half knew at\r\nthe time. There had been plenty to affect him even after, as has been\r\nsaid, they had shaken down; for his consciousness, though muffled, had\r\nits sharpest moments during this passage, a marked drop into innocent\r\nfriendly Bohemia. They then had put their elbows on the table,\r\ndeploring the premature end of their two or three dishes; which they\r\nhad tried to make up with another bottle while Chad joked a little\r\nspasmodically, perhaps even a little irrelevantly, with the hostess.\r\nWhat it all came to had been that fiction and fable _were_, inevitably,\r\nin the air, and not as a simple term of comparison, but as a result of\r\nthings said; also that they were blinking it, all round, and that they\r\nyet needn\xe2\x80\x99t, so much as that, have blinked it\xe2\x80\x94though indeed if they\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t Strether didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite see what else they could have done.\r\nStrether didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite see _that_ even at an hour or two past midnight,\r\neven when he had, at his hotel, for a long time, without a light and\r\nwithout undressing, sat back on his bedroom sofa and stared straight\r\nbefore him. He was, at that point of vantage, in full possession, to\r\nmake of it all what he could. He kept making of it that there had been\r\nsimply a _lie_ in the charming affair\xe2\x80\x94a lie on which one could now,\r\ndetached and deliberate, perfectly put one\xe2\x80\x99s finger. It was with the\r\nlie that they had eaten and drunk and talked and laughed, that they had\r\nwaited for their _carriole_ rather impatiently, and had then got into\r\nthe vehicle and, sensibly subsiding, driven their three or four miles\r\nthrough the darkening summer night. The eating and drinking, which had\r\nbeen a resource, had had the effect of having served its turn; the talk\r\nand laughter had done as much; and it was during their somewhat tedious\r\nprogress to the station, during the waits there, the further delays,\r\ntheir submission to fatigue, their silences in the dim compartment of\r\nthe much-stopping train, that he prepared himself for reflexions to\r\ncome. It had been a performance, Madame de Vionnet\xe2\x80\x99s manner, and though\r\nit had to that degree faltered toward the end, as through her ceasing\r\nto believe in it, as if she had asked herself, or Chad had found a\r\nmoment surreptitiously to ask her, what after all was the use, a\r\nperformance it had none the less quite handsomely remained, with the\r\nfinal fact about it that it was on the whole easier to keep up than to\r\nabandon.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of presence of mind it had been very wonderful\r\nindeed, wonderful for readiness, for beautiful assurance, for the way\r\nher decision was taken on the spot, without time to confer with Chad,\r\nwithout time for anything. Their only conference could have been the\r\nbrief instants in the boat before they confessed to recognising the\r\nspectator on the bank, for they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been alone together a moment\r\nsince and must have communicated all in silence. It was a part of the\r\ndeep impression for Strether, and not the least of the deep interest,\r\nthat they _could_ so communicate\xe2\x80\x94that Chad in particular could let her\r\nknow he left it to her. He habitually left things to others, as\r\nStrether was so well aware, and it in fact came over our friend in\r\nthese meditations that there had been as yet no such vivid illustration\r\nof his famous knowing how to live. It was as if he had humoured her to\r\nthe extent of letting her lie without correction\xe2\x80\x94almost as if, really,\r\nhe would be coming round in the morning to set the matter, as between\r\nStrether and himself, right. Of course he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite come; it was a\r\ncase in which a man was obliged to accept the woman\xe2\x80\x99s version, even\r\nwhen fantastic; if she had, with more flurry than she cared to show,\r\nelected, as the phrase was, to represent that they had left Paris that\r\nmorning, and with no design but of getting back within the day\xe2\x80\x94if she\r\nhad so sized-up, in the Woollett phrase, their necessity, she knew best\r\nher own measure. There were things, all the same, it was impossible to\r\nblink and which made this measure an odd one\xe2\x80\x94the too evident fact for\r\ninstance that she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t started out for the day dressed and hatted and\r\nshod, and even, for that matter, pink parasol\xe2\x80\x99d, as she had been in the\r\nboat. From what did the drop in her assurance proceed as the tension\r\nincreased\xe2\x80\x94from what did this slightly baffled ingenuity spring but from\r\nher consciousness of not presenting, as night closed in, with not so\r\nmuch as a shawl to wrap her round, an appearance that matched her\r\nstory? She admitted that she was cold, but only to blame her imprudence\r\nwhich Chad suffered her to give such account of as she might. Her shawl\r\nand Chad\xe2\x80\x99s overcoat and her other garments, and his, those they had\r\neach worn the day before, were at the place, best known to themselves\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nquiet retreat enough, no doubt\xe2\x80\x94at which they had been spending the\r\ntwenty-four hours, to which they had fully meant to return that\r\nevening, from which they had so remarkably swum into Strether\xe2\x80\x99s ken,\r\nand the tacit repudiation of which had been thus the essence of her\r\ncomedy. Strether saw how she had perceived in a flash that they\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite look to going back there under his nose; though,\r\nhonestly, as he gouged deeper into the matter, he was somewhat\r\nsurprised, as Chad likewise had perhaps been, at the uprising of this\r\nscruple. He seemed even to divine that she had entertained it rather\r\nfor Chad than for herself, and that, as the young man had lacked the\r\nchance to enlighten her, she had had to go on with it, he meanwhile\r\nmistaking her motive.\r\n\r\nHe was rather glad, none the less, that they had in point of fact not\r\nparted at the Cheval Blanc, that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been reduced to giving them\r\nhis blessing for an idyllic retreat down the river. He had had in the\r\nactual case to make-believe more than he liked, but this was nothing,\r\nit struck him, to what the other event would have required. Could he,\r\nliterally, quite have faced the other event? Would he have been capable\r\nof making the best of it with them? This was what he was trying to do\r\nnow; but with the advantage of his being able to give more time to it a\r\ngood deal counteracted by his sense of what, over and above the central\r\nfact itself, he had to swallow. It was the quantity of make-believe\r\ninvolved and so vividly exemplified that most disagreed with his\r\nspiritual stomach. He moved, however, from the consideration of that\r\nquantity\xe2\x80\x94to say nothing of the consciousness of that organ\xe2\x80\x94back to the\r\nother feature of the show, the deep, deep truth of the intimacy\r\nrevealed. That was what, in his vain vigil, he oftenest reverted to:\r\nintimacy, at such a point, was _like_ that\xe2\x80\x94and what in the world else\r\nwould one have wished it to be like? It was all very well for him to\r\nfeel the pity of its being so much like lying; he almost blushed, in\r\nthe dark, for the way he had dressed the possibility in vagueness, as a\r\nlittle girl might have dressed her doll. He had made them\xe2\x80\x94and by no\r\nfault of their own\xe2\x80\x94momentarily pull it for him, the possibility, out of\r\nthis vagueness; and must he not therefore take it now as they had had\r\nsimply, with whatever thin attenuations, to give it to him? The very\r\nquestion, it may be added, made him feel lonely and cold. There was the\r\nelement of the awkward all round, but Chad and Madame de Vionnet had at\r\nleast the comfort that they could talk it over together. With whom\r\ncould _he_ talk of such things?\xe2\x80\x94unless indeed always, at almost any\r\nstage, with Maria? He foresaw that Miss Gostrey would come again into\r\nrequisition on the morrow; though it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to be denied that he was\r\nalready a little afraid of her \xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what I want to\r\nknow now\xe2\x80\x94had you then supposed?\xe2\x80\x9d He recognised at last that he had\r\nreally been trying all along to suppose nothing. Verily, verily, his\r\nlabour had been lost. He found himself supposing innumerable and\r\nwonderful things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook Twelfth\r\n\r\n\r\n I\r\n\r\nStrether couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have said he had during the previous hours definitely\r\nexpected it; yet when, later on, that morning\xe2\x80\x94though no later indeed\r\nthan for his coming forth at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x94he saw the concierge produce,\r\non his approach, a _petit bleu_ delivered since his letters had been\r\nsent up, he recognised the appearance as the first symptom of a sequel.\r\nHe then knew he had been thinking of some early sign from Chad as more\r\nlikely, after all, than not; and this would be precisely the early\r\nsign. He took it so for granted that he opened the _petit bleu_ just\r\nwhere he had stopped, in the pleasant cool draught of the\r\n_porte-coch\xc3\xa8re_\xe2\x80\x94only curious to see where the young man would, at such\r\na juncture, break out. His curiosity, however, was more than gratified;\r\nthe small missive, whose gummed edge he had detached without attention\r\nto the address, not being from the young man at all, but from the\r\nperson whom the case gave him on the spot as still more worth while.\r\nWorth while or not, he went round to the nearest telegraph-office, the\r\nbig one on the Boulevard, with a directness that almost confessed to a\r\nfear of the danger of delay. He might have been thinking that if he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t go before he could think he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t perhaps go at all. He at\r\nany rate kept, in the lower side-pocket of his morning coat, a very\r\ndeliberate hand on his blue missive, crumpling it up rather tenderly\r\nthan harshly. He wrote a reply, on the Boulevard, also in the form of a\r\n_petit bleu_\xe2\x80\x94which was quickly done, under pressure of the place,\r\ninasmuch as, like Madame de Vionnet\xe2\x80\x99s own communication, it consisted\r\nof the fewest words. She had asked him if he could do her the very\r\ngreat kindness of coming to see her that evening at half-past nine, and\r\nhe answered, as if nothing were easier, that he would present himself\r\nat the hour she named. She had added a line of postscript, to the\r\neffect that she would come to him elsewhere and at his own hour if he\r\npreferred; but he took no notice of this, feeling that if he saw her at\r\nall half the value of it would be in seeing her where he had already\r\nseen her best. He mightn\xe2\x80\x99t see her at all; that was one of the\r\nreflexions he made after writing and before he dropped his closed card\r\ninto the box; he mightn\xe2\x80\x99t see any one at all any more at all; he might\r\nmake an end as well now as ever, leaving things as they were, since he\r\nwas doubtless not to leave them better, and taking his way home so far\r\nas should appear that a home remained to him. This alternative was for\r\na few minutes so sharp that if he at last did deposit his missive it\r\nwas perhaps because the pressure of the place had an effect.\r\n\r\nThere was none other, however, than the common and constant pressure,\r\nfamiliar to our friend under the rubric of _Postes et T\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9graphes_\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nsomething in the air of these establishments; the vibration of the vast\r\nstrange life of the town, the influence of the types, the performers\r\nconcocting their messages; the little prompt Paris women, arranging,\r\npretexting goodness knew what, driving the dreadful needle-pointed\r\npublic pen at the dreadful sand-strewn public table: implements that\r\nsymbolised for Strether\xe2\x80\x99s too interpretative innocence something more\r\nacute in manners, more sinister in morals, more fierce in the national\r\nlife. After he had put in his paper he had ranged himself, he was\r\nreally amused to think, on the side of the fierce, the sinister, the\r\nacute. He was carrying on a correspondence, across the great city,\r\nquite in the key of the _Postes et T\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9graphes_ in general; and it was\r\nfairly as if the acceptance of that fact had come from something in his\r\nstate that sorted with the occupation of his neighbours. He was mixed\r\nup with the typical tale of Paris, and so were they, poor things\xe2\x80\x94how\r\ncould they all together help being? They were no worse than he, in\r\nshort, and he no worse than they\xe2\x80\x94if, queerly enough, no better; and at\r\nall events he had settled his hash, so that he went out to begin, from\r\nthat moment, his day of waiting. The great settlement was, as he felt,\r\nin his preference for seeing his correspondent in her own best\r\nconditions. _That_ was part of the typical tale, the part most\r\nsignificant in respect to himself. He liked the place she lived in, the\r\npicture that each time squared itself, large and high and clear, around\r\nher: every occasion of seeing it was a pleasure of a different shade.\r\nYet what precisely was he doing with shades of pleasure now, and why\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t he properly and logically compelled her to commit herself to\r\nwhatever of disadvantage and penalty the situation might throw up? He\r\nmight have proposed, as for Sarah Pocock, the cold hospitality of his\r\nown _salon de lecture_, in which the chill of Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s visit seemed\r\nstill to abide and shades of pleasure were dim; he might have suggested\r\na stone bench in the dusty Tuileries or a penny chair at the back part\r\nof the Champs Elys\xc3\xa9es. These things would have been a trifle stern, and\r\nsternness alone now wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be sinister. An instinct in him cast about\r\nfor some form of discipline in which they might meet\xe2\x80\x94some awkwardness\r\nthey would suffer from, some danger, or at least some grave\r\ninconvenience, they would incur. This would give a sense\xe2\x80\x94which the\r\nspirit required, rather ached and sighed in the absence of\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nsomebody was paying something somewhere and somehow, that they were at\r\nleast not all floating together on the silver stream of impunity. Just\r\ninstead of that to go and see her late in the evening, as if, for all\r\nthe world\xe2\x80\x94well, as if he were as much in the swim as anybody else: this\r\nhad as little as possible in common with the penal form.\r\n\r\nEven when he had felt that objection melt away, however, the practical\r\ndifference was small; the long stretch of his interval took the colour\r\nit would, and if he lived on thus with the sinister from hour to hour\r\nit proved an easier thing than one might have supposed in advance. He\r\nreverted in thought to his old tradition, the one he had been brought\r\nup on and which even so many years of life had but little worn away;\r\nthe notion that the state of the wrongdoer, or at least this person\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhappiness, presented some special difficulty. What struck him now\r\nrather was the ease of it\xe2\x80\x94for nothing in truth appeared easier. It was\r\nan ease he himself fairly tasted of for the rest of the day; giving\r\nhimself quite up; not so much as trying to dress it out, in any\r\nparticular whatever, as a difficulty; not after all going to see\r\nMaria\xe2\x80\x94which would have been in a manner a result of such dressing; only\r\nidling, lounging, smoking, sitting in the shade, drinking lemonade and\r\nconsuming ices. The day had turned to heat and eventual thunder, and he\r\nnow and again went back to his hotel to find that Chad hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nthere. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet struck himself, since leaving Woollett, so much as\r\na loafer, though there had been times when he believed himself touching\r\nbottom. This was a deeper depth than any, and with no foresight,\r\nscarcely with a care, as to what he should bring up. He almost wondered\r\nif he didn\xe2\x80\x99t _look_ demoralised and disreputable; he had the fanciful\r\nvision, as he sat and smoked, of some accidental, some motived, return\r\nof the Pococks, who would be passing along the Boulevard and would\r\ncatch this view of him. They would have distinctly, on his appearance,\r\nevery ground for scandal. But fate failed to administer even that\r\nsternness; the Pococks never passed and Chad made no sign. Strether\r\nmeanwhile continued to hold off from Miss Gostrey, keeping her till\r\nto-morrow; so that by evening his irresponsibility, his impunity, his\r\nluxury, had become\xe2\x80\x94there was no other word for them\xe2\x80\x94immense.\r\n\r\nBetween nine and ten, at last, in the high clear picture\xe2\x80\x94he was moving\r\nin these days, as in a gallery, from clever canvas to clever canvas\xe2\x80\x94he\r\ndrew a long breath: it was so presented to him from the first that the\r\nspell of his luxury wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be broken. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have, that is, to\r\nbecome responsible\xe2\x80\x94this was admirably in the air: she had sent for him\r\nprecisely to let him feel it, so that he might go on with the comfort\r\n(comfort already established, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t it been?) of regarding his ordeal,\r\nthe ordeal of the weeks of Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s stay and of their climax, as safely\r\ntraversed and left behind him. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t she just wish to assure him that\r\n_she_ now took it all and so kept it; that he was absolutely not to\r\nworry any more, was only to rest on his laurels and continue generously\r\nto help her? The light in her beautiful formal room was dim, though it\r\nwould do, as everything would always do; the hot night had kept out\r\nlamps, but there was a pair of clusters of candles that glimmered over\r\nthe chimney-piece like the tall tapers of an altar. The windows were\r\nall open, their redundant hangings swaying a little, and he heard once\r\nmore, from the empty court, the small plash of the fountain. From\r\nbeyond this, and as from a great distance\xe2\x80\x94beyond the court, beyond the\r\n_corps de logis_ forming the front\xe2\x80\x94came, as if excited and exciting,\r\nthe vague voice of Paris. Strether had all along been subject to sudden\r\ngusts of fancy in connexion with such matters as these\xe2\x80\x94odd starts of\r\nthe historic sense, suppositions and divinations with no warrant but\r\ntheir intensity. Thus and so, on the eve of the great recorded dates,\r\nthe days and nights of revolution, the sounds had come in, the omens,\r\nthe beginnings broken out. They were the smell of revolution, the smell\r\nof the public temper\xe2\x80\x94or perhaps simply the smell of blood.\r\n\r\nIt was at present queer beyond words, \xe2\x80\x9csubtle,\xe2\x80\x9d he would have risked\r\nsaying, that such suggestions should keep crossing the scene; but it\r\nwas doubtless the effect of the thunder in the air, which had hung\r\nabout all day without release. His hostess was dressed as for\r\nthunderous times, and it fell in with the kind of imagination we have\r\njust attributed to him that she should be in simplest coolest white, of\r\na character so old-fashioned, if he were not mistaken, that Madame\r\nRoland must on the scaffold have worn something like it. This effect\r\nwas enhanced by a small black fichu or scarf, of crape or gauze,\r\ndisposed quaintly round her bosom and now completing as by a mystic\r\ntouch the pathetic, the noble analogy. Poor Strether in fact scarce\r\nknew what analogy was evoked for him as the charming woman, receiving\r\nhim and making him, as she could do such things, at once familiarly and\r\ngravely welcome, moved over her great room with her image almost\r\nrepeated in its polished floor, which had been fully bared for summer.\r\nThe associations of the place, all felt again; the gleam here and\r\nthere, in the subdued light, of glass and gilt and parquet, with the\r\nquietness of her own note as the centre\xe2\x80\x94these things were at first as\r\ndelicate as if they had been ghostly, and he was sure in a moment that,\r\nwhatever he should find he had come for, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be for an\r\nimpression that had previously failed him. That conviction held him\r\nfrom the outset, and, seeming singularly to simplify, certified to him\r\nthat the objects about would help him, would really help them both. No,\r\nhe might never see them again\xe2\x80\x94this was only too probably the last time;\r\nand he should certainly see nothing in the least degree like them. He\r\nshould soon be going to where such things were not, and it would be a\r\nsmall mercy for memory, for fancy, to have, in that stress, a loaf on\r\nthe shelf. He knew in advance he should look back on the perception\r\nactually sharpest with him as on the view of something old, old, old,\r\nthe oldest thing he had ever personally touched; and he also knew, even\r\nwhile he took his companion in as the feature among features, that\r\nmemory and fancy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help being enlisted for her. She might intend\r\nwhat she would, but this was beyond anything she could intend, with\r\nthings from far back\xe2\x80\x94tyrannies of history, facts of type, values, as\r\nthe painters said, of expression\xe2\x80\x94all working for her and giving her the\r\nsupreme chance, the chance of the happy, the really luxurious few, the\r\nchance, on a great occasion, to be natural and simple. She had never,\r\nwith him, been more so; or if it was the perfection of art it would\r\nnever\xe2\x80\x94and that came to the same thing\xe2\x80\x94be proved against her.\r\n\r\nWhat was truly wonderful was her way of differing so from time to time\r\nwithout detriment to her simplicity. Caprices, he was sure she felt,\r\nwere before anything else bad manners, and that judgement in her was by\r\nitself a thing making more for safety of intercourse than anything that\r\nin his various own past intercourses he had had to reckon on. If\r\ntherefore her presence was now quite other than the one she had shown\r\nhim the night before, there was nothing of violence in the change\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwas all harmony and reason. It gave him a mild deep person, whereas he\r\nhad had on the occasion to which their interview was a direct reference\r\na person committed to movement and surface and abounding in them; but\r\nshe was in either character more remarkable for nothing than for her\r\nbridging of intervals, and this now fell in with what he understood he\r\nwas to leave to her. The only thing was that, if he was to leave it\r\n_all_ to her, why exactly had she sent for him? He had had, vaguely, in\r\nadvance, his explanation, his view of the probability of her wishing to\r\nset something right, to deal in some way with the fraud so lately\r\npractised on his presumed credulity. Would she attempt to carry it\r\nfurther or would she blot it out? Would she throw over it some more or\r\nless happy colour; or would she do nothing about it at all? He\r\nperceived soon enough at least that, however reasonable she might be,\r\nshe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t vulgarly confused, and it herewith pressed upon him that\r\ntheir eminent \xe2\x80\x9clie,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad\xe2\x80\x99s and hers, was simply after all such an\r\ninevitable tribute to good taste as he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have wished them not to\r\nrender. Away from them, during his vigil, he had seemed to wince at the\r\namount of comedy involved; whereas in his present posture he could only\r\nask himself how he should enjoy any attempt from her to take the comedy\r\nback. He shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy it at all; but, once more and yet once more,\r\nhe could trust her. That is he could trust her to make deception right.\r\nAs she presented things the ugliness\xe2\x80\x94goodness knew why\xe2\x80\x94went out of\r\nthem; none the less too that she could present them, with an art of her\r\nown, by not so much as touching them. She let the matter, at all\r\nevents, lie where it was\xe2\x80\x94where the previous twenty-four hours had\r\nplaced it; appearing merely to circle about it respectfully, tenderly,\r\nalmost piously, while she took up another question.\r\n\r\nShe knew she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t really thrown dust in his eyes; this, the previous\r\nnight, before they separated, had practically passed between them; and,\r\nas she had sent for him to see what the difference thus made for him\r\nmight amount to, so he was conscious at the end of five minutes that he\r\nhad been tried and tested. She had settled with Chad after he left them\r\nthat she would, for her satisfaction, assure herself of this quantity,\r\nand Chad had, as usual, let her have her way. Chad was always letting\r\npeople have their way when he felt that it would somehow turn his wheel\r\nfor him; it somehow always did turn his wheel. Strether felt, oddly\r\nenough, before these facts, freshly and consentingly passive; they\r\nagain so rubbed it into him that the couple thus fixing his attention\r\nwere intimate, that his intervention had absolutely aided and\r\nintensified their intimacy, and that in fine he must accept the\r\nconsequence of that. He had absolutely become, himself, with his\r\nperceptions and his mistakes, his concessions and his reserves, the\r\ndroll mixture, as it must seem to them, of his braveries and his fears,\r\nthe general spectacle of his art and his innocence, almost an added\r\nlink and certainly a common priceless ground for them to meet upon. It\r\nwas as if he had been hearing their very tone when she brought out a\r\nreference that was comparatively straight. \xe2\x80\x9cThe last twice that you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen here, you know, I never asked you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with an abrupt\r\ntransition\xe2\x80\x94they had been pretending before this to talk simply of the\r\ncharm of yesterday and of the interest of the country they had seen.\r\nThe effort was confessedly vain; not for such talk had she invited him;\r\nand her impatient reminder was of their having done for it all the\r\nneedful on his coming to her after Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s flight. What she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nasked him then was to state to her where and how he stood for her; she\r\nhad been resting on Chad\xe2\x80\x99s report of their midnight hour together in\r\nthe Boulevard Malesherbes. The thing therefore she at present desired\r\nwas ushered in by this recall of the two occasions on which,\r\ndisinterested and merciful, she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t worried him. To-night truly she\r\n_would_ worry him, and this was her appeal to him to let her risk it.\r\nHe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to mind if she bored him a little: she had behaved, after\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94hadn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x94so awfully, awfully well.\r\n\r\n\r\n II\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99re all right, you\xe2\x80\x99re all right,\xe2\x80\x9d he almost impatiently\r\ndeclared; his impatience being moreover not for her pressure, but for\r\nher scruple. More and more distinct to him was the tune to which she\r\nwould have had the matter out with Chad: more and more vivid for him\r\nthe idea that she had been nervous as to what he might be able to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cstand.\xe2\x80\x9d Yes, it had been a question if he had \xe2\x80\x9cstood\xe2\x80\x9d what the scene\r\non the river had given him, and, though the young man had doubtless\r\nopined in favour of his recuperation, her own last word must have been\r\nthat she should feel easier in seeing for herself. That was it,\r\nunmistakeably; she _was_ seeing for herself. What he could stand was\r\nthus, in these moments, in the balance for Strether, who reflected, as\r\nhe became fully aware of it, that he must properly brace himself. He\r\nwanted fully to appear to stand all he might; and there was a certain\r\ncommand of the situation for him in this very wish not to look too much\r\nat sea. She was ready with everything, but so, sufficiently, was he;\r\nthat is he was at one point the more prepared of the two, inasmuch as,\r\nfor all her cleverness, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t produce on the spot\xe2\x80\x94and it was\r\nsurprising\xe2\x80\x94an account of the motive of her note. He had the advantage\r\nthat his pronouncing her \xe2\x80\x9call right\xe2\x80\x9d gave him for an enquiry. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I\r\nask, delighted as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to come, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve wished to say something\r\nspecial?\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke as if she might have seen he had been waiting for\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94not indeed with discomfort, but with natural interest. Then he saw\r\nthat she was a little taken aback, was even surprised herself at the\r\ndetail she had neglected\xe2\x80\x94the only one ever yet; having somehow assumed\r\nhe would know, would recognise, would leave some things not to be said.\r\nShe looked at him, however, an instant as if to convey that if he\r\nwanted them _all_\xe2\x80\x94!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSelfish and vulgar\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what I must seem to you. You\xe2\x80\x99ve done\r\neverything for me, and here I am as if I were asking for more. But it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid\xe2\x80\x94though I _am_ of course\r\nafraid, as a woman in my position always is. I mean it isn\xe2\x80\x99t because\r\none lives in terror\xe2\x80\x94it isn\xe2\x80\x99t because of that one is selfish, for I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nready to give you my word to-night that I don\xe2\x80\x99t care; don\xe2\x80\x99t care what\r\nstill may happen and what I may lose. I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to raise your\r\nlittle finger for me again, nor do I wish so much as to mention to you\r\nwhat we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked of before, either my danger or my safety, or his\r\nmother, or his sister, or the girl he may marry, or the fortune he may\r\nmake or miss, or the right or the wrong, of any kind, he may do. If\r\nafter the help one has had from you one can\xe2\x80\x99t either take care of one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nself or simply hold one\xe2\x80\x99s tongue, one must renounce all claim to be an\r\nobject of interest. It\xe2\x80\x99s in the name of what I _do_ care about that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve tried still to keep hold of you. How can I be indifferent,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked, \xe2\x80\x9cto how I appear to you?\xe2\x80\x9d And as he found himself unable\r\nimmediately to say: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, if you\xe2\x80\x99re going, _need_ you, after all? Is it\r\nimpossible you should stay on\xe2\x80\x94so that one mayn\xe2\x80\x99t lose you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible I should live with you here instead of going home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot \xe2\x80\x98with\xe2\x80\x99 us, if you object to that, but near enough to us,\r\nsomewhere, for us to see you\xe2\x80\x94well,\xe2\x80\x9d she beautifully brought out, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen\r\nwe feel we _must_. How shall we not sometimes feel it? I\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted to\r\nsee you often when I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she pursued, \xe2\x80\x9call these last weeks. How\r\nshan\xe2\x80\x99t I then miss you now, with the sense of your being gone forever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThen as if the straightness of this appeal, taking him unprepared, had\r\nvisibly left him wondering: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere _is_ your \xe2\x80\x98home\xe2\x80\x99 moreover now\xe2\x80\x94what\r\nhas become of it? I\xe2\x80\x99ve made a change in your life, I know I have; I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nupset everything in your mind as well; in your sense of\xe2\x80\x94what shall I\r\ncall it?\xe2\x80\x94all the decencies and possibilities. It gives me a kind of\r\ndetestation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She pulled up short.\r\n\r\nOh but he wanted to hear. \xe2\x80\x9cDetestation of what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf everything\xe2\x80\x94of life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh that\xe2\x80\x99s too much,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cor too little!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo little, precisely\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she was eager. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I hate is myself\xe2\x80\x94when I\r\nthink that one has to take so much, to be happy, out of the lives of\r\nothers, and that one isn\xe2\x80\x99t happy even then. One does it to cheat one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nself and to stop one\xe2\x80\x99s mouth\xe2\x80\x94but that\xe2\x80\x99s only at the best for a little.\r\nThe wretched self is always there, always making one somehow a fresh\r\nanxiety. What it comes to is that it\xe2\x80\x99s not, that it\xe2\x80\x99s never, a\r\nhappiness, any happiness at all, to _take_. The only safe thing is to\r\ngive. It\xe2\x80\x99s what plays you least false.\xe2\x80\x9d Interesting, touching,\r\nstrikingly sincere as she let these things come from her, she yet\r\npuzzled and troubled him\xe2\x80\x94so fine was the quaver of her quietness. He\r\nfelt what he had felt before with her, that there was always more\r\nbehind what she showed, and more and more again behind that. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know\r\nso, at least,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ ought to know it indeed then; for isn\xe2\x80\x99t what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been giving\r\nexactly what has brought us together this way? You\xe2\x80\x99ve been making, as\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve so fully let you know I\xe2\x80\x99ve felt,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe most\r\nprecious present I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen made, and if you can\xe2\x80\x99t sit down\r\npeacefully on that performance you _are_, no doubt, born to torment\r\nyourself. But you ought,\xe2\x80\x9d he wound up, \xe2\x80\x9cto be easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not trouble you any more, no doubt\xe2\x80\x94not thrust on you even the\r\nwonder and the beauty of what I\xe2\x80\x99ve done; only let you regard our\r\nbusiness as over, and well over, and see you depart in a peace that\r\nmatches my own? No doubt, no doubt, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d she nervously\r\nrepeated\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9call the more that I don\xe2\x80\x99t really pretend I believe you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, for yourself, _not_ have done what you have. I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend\r\nyou feel yourself victimised, for this evidently is the way you live,\r\nand it\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99re agreed\xe2\x80\x94is the best way. Yes, as you say,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued after a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cI ought to be easy and rest on my work. Well\r\nthen here am I doing so. I _am_ easy. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have it for your last\r\nimpression. When is it you say you go?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked with a quick change.\r\n\r\nHe took some time to reply\xe2\x80\x94his last impression was more and more so\r\nmixed a one. It produced in him a vague disappointment, a drop that was\r\ndeeper even than the fall of his elation the previous night. The good\r\nof what he had done, if he had done so much, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there to enliven\r\nhim quite to the point that would have been ideal for a grand gay\r\nfinale. Women were thus endlessly absorbent, and to deal with them was\r\nto walk on water. What was at bottom the matter with her, embroider as\r\nshe might and disclaim as she might\xe2\x80\x94what was at bottom the matter with\r\nher was simply Chad himself. It was of Chad she was after all renewedly\r\nafraid; the strange strength of her passion was the very strength of\r\nher fear; she clung to _him_, Lambert Strether, as to a source of\r\nsafety she had tested, and, generous graceful truthful as she might try\r\nto be, exquisite as she was, she dreaded the term of his being within\r\nreach. With this sharpest perception yet, it was like a chill in the\r\nair to him, it was almost appalling, that a creature so fine could be,\r\nby mysterious forces, a creature so exploited. For at the end of all\r\nthings they _were_ mysterious: she had but made Chad what he was\xe2\x80\x94so why\r\ncould she think she had made him infinite? She had made him better, she\r\nhad made him best, she had made him anything one would; but it came to\r\nour friend with supreme queerness that he was none the less only Chad.\r\nStrether had the sense that _he_, a little, had made him too; his high\r\nappreciation had as it were, consecrated her work The work, however\r\nadmirable, was nevertheless of the strict human order, and in short it\r\nwas marvellous that the companion of mere earthly joys, of comforts,\r\naberrations (however one classed them) within the common experience\r\nshould be so transcendently prized. It might have made Strether hot or\r\nshy, as such secrets of others brought home sometimes do make us; but\r\nhe was held there by something so hard that it was fairly grim. This\r\nwas not the discomposure of last night; that had quite passed\xe2\x80\x94such\r\ndiscomposures were a detail; the real coercion was to see a man\r\nineffably adored. There it was again\xe2\x80\x94it took women, it took women; if\r\nto deal with them was to walk on water what wonder that the water rose?\r\nAnd it had never surely risen higher than round this woman. He\r\npresently found himself taking a long look from her, and the next thing\r\nhe knew he had uttered all his thought. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re afraid for your life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt drew out her long look, and he soon enough saw why. A spasm came\r\ninto her face, the tears she had already been unable to hide overflowed\r\nat first in silence, and then, as the sound suddenly comes from a\r\nchild, quickened to gasps, to sobs. She sat and covered her face with\r\nher hands, giving up all attempt at a manner. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s how you see me,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s how you see me\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she caught her breath with it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand it\xe2\x80\x99s as I _am_,\r\nand as I must take myself, and of course it\xe2\x80\x99s no matter.\xe2\x80\x9d Her emotion\r\nwas at first so incoherent that he could only stand there at a loss,\r\nstand with his sense of having upset her, though of having done it by\r\nthe truth. He had to listen to her in a silence that he made no\r\nimmediate effort to attenuate, feeling her doubly woeful amid all her\r\ndim diffused elegance; consenting to it as he had consented to the\r\nrest, and even conscious of some vague inward irony in the presence of\r\nsuch a fine free range of bliss and bale. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say it was _not_\r\nno matter; for he was serving her to the end, he now knew, anyway\xe2\x80\x94quite\r\nas if what he thought of her had nothing to do with it. It was actually\r\nmoreover as if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think of her at all, as if he could think of\r\nnothing but the passion, mature, abysmal, pitiful, she represented, and\r\nthe possibilities she betrayed. She was older for him to-night, visibly\r\nless exempt from the touch of time; but she was as much as ever the\r\nfinest and subtlest creature, the happiest apparition, it had been\r\ngiven him, in all his years, to meet; and yet he could see her there as\r\nvulgarly troubled, in very truth, as a maidservant crying for her young\r\nman. The only thing was that she judged herself as the maidservant\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t; the weakness of which wisdom too, the dishonour of which\r\njudgement, seemed but to sink her lower. Her collapse, however, no\r\ndoubt, was briefer and she had in a manner recovered herself before he\r\nintervened. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid for my life. But that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing. It\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent a little longer, as if thinking what it might be.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something I have in mind that I can still do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she threw off at last, with a sharp sad headshake, drying her eyes,\r\nwhat he could still do. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care for that. Of course, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nsaid, you\xe2\x80\x99re acting, in your wonderful way, for yourself; and what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfor yourself is no more my business\xe2\x80\x94though I may reach out unholy hands\r\nso clumsily to touch it\xe2\x80\x94than if it were something in Timbuctoo. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonly that you don\xe2\x80\x99t snub me, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve had fifty chances to do\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonly your beautiful patience that makes one forget one\xe2\x80\x99s manners. In\r\nspite of your patience, all the same,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99d do anything\r\nrather than be with us here, even if that were possible. You\xe2\x80\x99d do\r\neverything for us but be mixed up with us\xe2\x80\x94which is a statement you can\r\neasily answer to the advantage of your own manners. You can say \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe use of talking of things that at the best are impossible?\xe2\x80\x99 What\r\n_is_ of course the use? It\xe2\x80\x99s only my little madness. You\xe2\x80\x99d talk if you\r\nwere tormented. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean now about _him_. Oh for him\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nPositively, strangely, bitterly, as it seemed to Strether, she gave\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chim,\xe2\x80\x9d for the moment, away. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t care what I think of you; but I\r\nhappen to care what you think of me. And what you _might_,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you perhaps even did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gained time. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I did\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid think before. Before this. _Didn\xe2\x80\x99t_ you think\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he had already stopped her. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think anything. I never think\r\na step further than I\xe2\x80\x99m obliged to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly false, I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cexcept that you may,\r\nno doubt, often pull up when things become _too_ ugly; or even, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsay, to save you a protest, too beautiful. At any rate, even so far as\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s true, we\xe2\x80\x99ve thrust on you appearances that you\xe2\x80\x99ve had to take in\r\nand that have therefore made your obligation. Ugly or beautiful\xe2\x80\x94it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what we call them\xe2\x80\x94you were getting on without them, and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s where we\xe2\x80\x99re detestable. We bore you\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s where we are. And we\r\nmay well\xe2\x80\x94for what we\xe2\x80\x99ve cost you. All you can do _now_ is not to think\r\nat all. And I who should have liked to seem to you\xe2\x80\x94well, sublime!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could only after a moment re-echo Miss Barrace. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re wonderful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m old and abject and hideous\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she went on as without hearing him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbject above all. Or old above all. It\xe2\x80\x99s when one\xe2\x80\x99s old that it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nworst. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what becomes of it\xe2\x80\x94let what _will_; there it is.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a doom\xe2\x80\x94I know it; you can\xe2\x80\x99t see it more than I do myself. Things\r\nhave to happen as they will.\xe2\x80\x9d With which she came back again to what,\r\nface to face with him, had so quite broken down. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course you\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, even if possible, and no matter what may happen to you, be\r\nnear us. But think of me, think of me\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d She exhaled it into air.\r\n\r\nHe took refuge in repeating something he had already said and that she\r\nhad made nothing of. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something I believe I can still do.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nhe put his hand out for good-bye.\r\n\r\nShe again made nothing of it; she went on with her insistence. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t help you. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to help you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it may help _you_,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s not a grain of certainty in my future\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nthe only certainty is that I shall be the loser in the end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t taken his hand, but she moved with him to the door. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncheerful,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cfor your benefactor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s cheerful for _me_,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cis that we might, you and I,\r\nhave been friends. That\xe2\x80\x99s it\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s it. You see how, as I say, I want\r\neverything. I\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted you too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but you\xe2\x80\x99ve _had_ me!\xe2\x80\x9d he declared, at the door, with an emphasis\r\nthat made an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n III\r\n\r\nHis purpose had been to see Chad the next day, and he had prefigured\r\nseeing him by an early call; having in general never stood on ceremony\r\nin respect to visits at the Boulevard Malesherbes. It had been more\r\noften natural for him to go there than for Chad to come to the small\r\nhotel, the attractions of which were scant; yet it nevertheless, just\r\nnow, at the eleventh hour, did suggest itself to Strether to begin by\r\ngiving the young man a chance. It struck him that, in the inevitable\r\ncourse, Chad would be \xe2\x80\x9cround,\xe2\x80\x9d as Waymarsh used to say\xe2\x80\x94Waymarsh who\r\nalready, somehow, seemed long ago. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come the day before,\r\nbecause it had been arranged between them that Madame de Vionnet should\r\nsee their friend first; but now that this passage had taken place he\r\nwould present himself, and their friend wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have long to wait.\r\nStrether assumed, he became aware, on this reasoning, that the\r\ninteresting parties to the arrangement would have met betimes, and that\r\nthe more interesting of the two\xe2\x80\x94as she was after all\xe2\x80\x94would have\r\ncommunicated to the other the issue of her appeal. Chad would know\r\nwithout delay that his mother\xe2\x80\x99s messenger had been with her, and,\r\nthough it was perhaps not quite easy to see how she could qualify what\r\nhad occurred, he would at least have been sufficiently advised to feel\r\nhe could go on. The day, however, brought, early or late, no word from\r\nhim, and Strether felt, as a result of this, that a change had\r\npractically come over their intercourse. It was perhaps a premature\r\njudgement; or it only meant perhaps\xe2\x80\x94how could he tell?\xe2\x80\x94that the\r\nwonderful pair he protected had taken up again together the excursion\r\nhe had accidentally checked. They might have gone back to the country,\r\nand gone back but with a long breath drawn; that indeed would best mark\r\nChad\xe2\x80\x99s sense that reprobation hadn\xe2\x80\x99t rewarded Madame de Vionnet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrequest for an interview. At the end of the twenty-four hours, at the\r\nend of the forty-eight, there was still no overture; so that Strether\r\nfilled up the time, as he had so often filled it before, by going to\r\nsee Miss Gostrey.\r\n\r\nHe proposed amusements to her; he felt expert now in proposing\r\namusements; and he had thus, for several days, an odd sense of leading\r\nher about Paris, of driving her in the Bois, of showing her the penny\r\nsteamboats\xe2\x80\x94those from which the breeze of the Seine was to be best\r\nenjoyed\xe2\x80\x94that might have belonged to a kindly uncle doing the honours of\r\nthe capital to an intelligent niece from the country. He found means\r\neven to take her to shops she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know, or that she pretended she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t; while she, on her side, was, like the country maiden, all\r\npassive modest and grateful\xe2\x80\x94going in fact so far as to emulate\r\nrusticity in occasional fatigues and bewilderments. Strether described\r\nthese vague proceedings to himself, described them even to her, as a\r\nhappy interlude; the sign of which was that the companions said for the\r\ntime no further word about the matter they had talked of to satiety. He\r\nproclaimed satiety at the outset, and she quickly took the hint; as\r\ndocile both in this and in everything else as the intelligent obedient\r\nniece. He told her as yet nothing of his late adventure\xe2\x80\x94for as an\r\nadventure it now ranked with him; he pushed the whole business\r\ntemporarily aside and found his interest in the fact of her beautiful\r\nassent. She left questions unasked\xe2\x80\x94she who for so long had been all\r\nquestions; she gave herself up to him with an understanding of which\r\nmere mute gentleness might have seemed the sufficient expression. She\r\nknew his sense of his situation had taken still another step\xe2\x80\x94of that he\r\nwas quite aware; but she conveyed that, whatever had thus happened for\r\nhim, it was thrown into the shade by what was happening for herself.\r\nThis\xe2\x80\x94though it mightn\xe2\x80\x99t to a detached spirit have seemed much\xe2\x80\x94was the\r\nmajor interest, and she met it with a new directness of response,\r\nmeasuring it from hour to hour with her grave hush of acceptance.\r\nTouched as he had so often been by her before, he was, for his part\r\ntoo, touched afresh; all the more that though he could be duly aware of\r\nthe principle of his own mood he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be equally so of the\r\nprinciple of hers. He knew, that is, in a manner\xe2\x80\x94knew roughly and\r\nresignedly\xe2\x80\x94what he himself was hatching; whereas he had to take the\r\nchance of what he called to himself Maria\xe2\x80\x99s calculations. It was all he\r\nneeded that she liked him enough for what they were doing, and even\r\nshould they do a good deal more would still like him enough for that;\r\nthe essential freshness of a relation so simple was a cool bath to the\r\nsoreness produced by other relations. These others appeared to him now\r\nhorribly complex; they bristled with fine points, points all\r\nunimaginable beforehand, points that pricked and drew blood; a fact\r\nthat gave to an hour with his present friend on a _bateau-mouche_, or\r\nin the afternoon shade of the Champs Elys\xc3\xa9es, something of the innocent\r\npleasure of handling rounded ivory. His relation with Chad\r\npersonally\xe2\x80\x94from the moment he had got his point of view\xe2\x80\x94had been of the\r\nsimplest; yet this also struck him as bristling, after a third and a\r\nfourth blank day had passed. It was as if at last however his care for\r\nsuch indications had dropped; there came a fifth blank day and he\r\nceased to enquire or to heed.\r\n\r\nThey now took on to his fancy, Miss Gostrey and he, the image of the\r\nBabes in the Wood; they could trust the merciful elements to let them\r\ncontinue at peace. He had been great already, as he knew, at\r\npostponements; but he had only to get afresh into the rhythm of one to\r\nfeel its fine attraction. It amused him to say to himself that he might\r\nfor all the world have been going to die\xe2\x80\x94die resignedly; the scene was\r\nfilled for him with so deep a death-bed hush, so melancholy a charm.\r\nThat meant the postponement of everything else\xe2\x80\x94which made so for the\r\nquiet lapse of life; and the postponement in especial of the reckoning\r\nto come\xe2\x80\x94unless indeed the reckoning to come were to be one and the same\r\nthing with extinction. It faced him, the reckoning, over the shoulder\r\nof much interposing experience\xe2\x80\x94which also faced him; and one would\r\nfloat to it doubtless duly through these caverns of Kubla Khan. It was\r\nreally behind everything; it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t merged in what he had done; his\r\nfinal appreciation of what he had done\xe2\x80\x94his appreciation on the\r\nspot\xe2\x80\x94would provide it with its main sharpness. The spot so focussed was\r\nof course Woollett, and he was to see, at the best, what Woollett would\r\nbe with everything there changed for him. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t _that_ revelation\r\npractically amount to the wind-up of his career? Well, the summer\xe2\x80\x99s end\r\nwould show; his suspense had meanwhile exactly the sweetness of vain\r\ndelay; and he had with it, we should mention, other pastimes than\r\nMaria\xe2\x80\x99s company\xe2\x80\x94plenty of separate musings in which his luxury failed\r\nhim but at one point. He was well in port, the outer sea behind him,\r\nand it was only a matter of getting ashore. There was a question that\r\ncame and went for him, however, as he rested against the side of his\r\nship, and it was a little to get rid of the obsession that he prolonged\r\nhis hours with Miss Gostrey. It was a question about himself, but it\r\ncould only be settled by seeing Chad again; it was indeed his principal\r\nreason for wanting to see Chad. After that it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t signify\xe2\x80\x94it was a\r\nghost that certain words would easily lay to rest. Only the young man\r\nmust be there to take the words. Once they were taken he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\na question left; none, that is, in connexion with this particular\r\naffair. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t then matter even to himself that he might now have\r\nbeen guilty of speaking _because_ of what he had forfeited. That was\r\nthe refinement of his supreme scruple\xe2\x80\x94he wished so to leave what he had\r\nforfeited out of account. He wished not to do anything because he had\r\nmissed something else, because he was sore or sorry or impoverished,\r\nbecause he was maltreated or desperate; he wished to do everything\r\nbecause he was lucid and quiet, just the same for himself on all\r\nessential points as he had ever been. Thus it was that while he\r\nvirtually hung about for Chad he kept mutely putting it: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nchucked, old boy; but what has that to do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d It would have\r\nsickened him to feel vindictive.\r\n\r\nThese tints of feeling indeed were doubtless but the iridescence of his\r\nidleness, and they were presently lost in a new light from Maria. She\r\nhad a fresh fact for him before the week was out, and she practically\r\nmet him with it on his appearing one night. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t on this day seen\r\nher, but had planned presenting himself in due course to ask her to\r\ndine with him somewhere out of doors, on one of the terraces, in one of\r\nthe gardens, of which the Paris of summer was profuse. It had then come\r\non to rain, so that, disconcerted, he changed his mind; dining alone at\r\nhome, a little stuffily and stupidly, and waiting on her afterwards to\r\nmake up his loss. He was sure within a minute that something had\r\nhappened; it was so in the air of the rich little room that he had\r\nscarcely to name his thought. Softly lighted, the whole colour of the\r\nplace, with its vague values, was in cool fusion\xe2\x80\x94an effect that made\r\nthe visitor stand for a little agaze. It was as if in doing so now he\r\nhad felt a recent presence\xe2\x80\x94his recognition of the passage of which his\r\nhostess in turn divined. She had scarcely to say it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she has been\r\nhere, and this time I received her.\xe2\x80\x9d It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t till a minute later that\r\nshe added: \xe2\x80\x9cThere being, as I understand you, no reason _now_\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone for your refusing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94if you\xe2\x80\x99ve done what you\xe2\x80\x99ve had to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly so far done it,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether said, \xe2\x80\x9cas that you needn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfear the effect, or the appearance of coming between us. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing between us now but what we ourselves have put there, and not an\r\ninch of room for anything else whatever. Therefore you\xe2\x80\x99re only\r\nbeautifully _with_ us as always\xe2\x80\x94though doubtless now, if she has talked\r\nto you, rather more with us than less. Of course if she came,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cit was to talk to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was to talk to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Maria returned; on which he was further sure\r\nthat she was practically in possession of what he himself hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet\r\ntold her. He was even sure she was in possession of things he himself\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have told; for the consciousness of them was now all in her\r\nface and accompanied there with a shade of sadness that marked in her\r\nthe close of all uncertainties. It came out for him more than ever yet\r\nthat she had had from the first a knowledge she believed him not to\r\nhave had, a knowledge the sharp acquisition of which might be destined\r\nto make a difference for him. The difference for him might not\r\ninconceivably be an arrest of his independence and a change in his\r\nattitude\xe2\x80\x94in other words a revulsion in favour of the principles of\r\nWoollett. She had really prefigured the possibility of a shock that\r\nwould send him swinging back to Mrs. Newsome. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t, it was true,\r\nweek after week, shown signs of receiving it, but the possibility had\r\nbeen none the less in the air. What Maria accordingly had had now to\r\ntake in was that the shock had descended and that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t, all the\r\nsame, swung back. He had grown clear, in a flash, on a point long since\r\nsettled for herself; but no reapproximation to Mrs. Newsome had\r\noccurred in consequence. Madame de Vionnet had by her visit held up the\r\ntorch to these truths, and what now lingered in poor Maria\xe2\x80\x99s face was\r\nthe somewhat smoky light of the scene between them. If the light\r\nhowever wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, as we have hinted, the glow of joy, the reasons for\r\nthis also were perhaps discernible to Strether even through the blur\r\ncast over them by his natural modesty. She had held herself for months\r\nwith a firm hand; she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t interfered on any chance\xe2\x80\x94and chances were\r\nspecious enough\xe2\x80\x94that she might interfere to her profit. She had turned\r\nher back on the dream that Mrs. Newsome\xe2\x80\x99s rupture, their friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nforfeiture\xe2\x80\x94the engagement, the relation itself, broken beyond all\r\nmending\xe2\x80\x94might furnish forth her advantage; and, to stay her hand from\r\npromoting these things, she had on private, difficult, but rigid,\r\nlines, played strictly fair. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t therefore but feel that,\r\nthough, as the end of all, the facts in question had been stoutly\r\nconfirmed, her ground for personal, for what might have been called\r\ninterested, elation remained rather vague. Strether might easily have\r\nmade out that she had been asking herself, in the hours she had just\r\nsat through, if there were still for her, or were only not, a fair\r\nshade of uncertainty. Let us hasten to add, however, that what he at\r\nfirst made out on this occasion he also at first kept to himself. He\r\nonly asked what in particular Madame de Vionnet had come for, and as to\r\nthis his companion was ready.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wants tidings of Mr. Newsome, whom she appears not to have seen\r\nfor some days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been away with him again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe seemed to think,\xe2\x80\x9d Maria answered, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he might have gone away\r\nwith _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did you tell her I know nothing of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had her indulgent headshake. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve known nothing of what you know.\r\nI could only tell her I\xe2\x80\x99d ask you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen him for a week\xe2\x80\x94and of course I\xe2\x80\x99ve wondered.\xe2\x80\x9d His\r\nwonderment showed at this moment as sharper, but he presently went on.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, I dare say I can put my hand on him. Did she strike you,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked, \xe2\x80\x9cas anxious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s always anxious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all I\xe2\x80\x99ve done for her?\xe2\x80\x9d And he had one of the last flickers of\r\nhis occasional mild mirth. \xe2\x80\x9cTo think that was just what I came out to\r\nprevent!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took it up but to reply. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t regard him then as safe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was just going to ask you how in that respect you regard Madame de\r\nVionnet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him a little. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat woman was _ever_ safe? She told me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe added\xe2\x80\x94and it was as if at the touch of the connexion\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cof your\r\nextraordinary meeting in the country. After that _\xc3\xa0 quoi se fier?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was, as an accident, in all the possible or impossible chapter,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nStrether conceded, \xe2\x80\x9camazing enough. But still, but still\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut still she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, as you don\xe2\x80\x99t either, we may all sink to rest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe appeared to agree with her, but he had his reservation. \xe2\x80\x9cI do mind\r\nChad\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you\xe2\x80\x99ll get him back. But now you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy I went to\r\nMentone.\xe2\x80\x9d He had sufficiently let her see that he had by this time\r\ngathered things together, but there was nature in her wish to make them\r\nclearer still. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t want you to put it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo put it to you\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe question of what you were at last\xe2\x80\x94a week ago\xe2\x80\x94to see for yourself.\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to have to lie for her. I felt that to be too much for\r\nme. A man of course is always expected to do it\xe2\x80\x94to do it, I mean, for a\r\nwoman; but not a woman for another woman; unless perhaps on the\r\ntit-for-tat principle, as an indirect way of protecting herself. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t need protection, so that I was free to \xe2\x80\x98funk\xe2\x80\x99 you\xe2\x80\x94simply to dodge\r\nyour test. The responsibility was too much for me. I gained time, and\r\nwhen I came back the need of a test had blown over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether thought of it serenely. \xe2\x80\x9cYes; when you came back little Bilham\r\nhad shown me what\xe2\x80\x99s expected of a gentleman. Little Bilham had lied\r\nlike one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd like what you believed him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cit was but a technical lie\xe2\x80\x94he classed the\r\nattachment as virtuous. That was a view for which there was much to be\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94and the virtue came out for me hugely There was of course a great\r\ndeal of it. I got it full in the face, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t, you see, done\r\nwith it yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I see, what I saw,\xe2\x80\x9d Maria returned, \xe2\x80\x9cis that you dressed up even\r\nthe virtue. You were wonderful\xe2\x80\x94you were beautiful, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve had the\r\nhonour of telling you before; but, if you wish really to know,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsadly confessed, \xe2\x80\x9cI never quite knew _where_ you were. There were\r\nmoments,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you struck me as grandly cynical; there\r\nwere others when you struck me as grandly vague.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer friend considered. \xe2\x80\x9cI had phases. I had flights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but things must have a basis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA basis seemed to me just what her beauty supplied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer beauty of person?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, her beauty of everything. The impression she makes. She has such\r\nvariety and yet such harmony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe considered him with one of her deep returns of indulgence\xe2\x80\x94returns\r\nout of all proportion to the irritations they flooded over. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ncomplete.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re always too personal,\xe2\x80\x9d he good-humouredly said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprecisely how I wondered and wandered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she was from the first for you the\r\nmost charming woman in the world, nothing\xe2\x80\x99s more simple. Only that was\r\nan odd foundation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor what I reared on it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor what you didn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it was all not a fixed quantity. And it had for me\xe2\x80\x94it has\r\nstill\xe2\x80\x94such elements of strangeness. Her greater age than his, her\r\ndifferent world, traditions, association; her other opportunities,\r\nliabilities, standards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend listened with respect to his enumeration of these\r\ndisparities; then she disposed of them at a stroke. \xe2\x80\x9cThose things are\r\nnothing when a woman\xe2\x80\x99s hit. It\xe2\x80\x99s very awful. She was hit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether, on his side, did justice to that plea. \xe2\x80\x9cOh of course I saw\r\nshe was hit. That she was hit was what we were busy with; that she was\r\nhit was our great affair. But somehow I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of her as down\r\nin the dust. And as put there by _our_ little Chad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet wasn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x98your\xe2\x80\x99 little Chad just your miracle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether admitted it. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I moved among miracles. It was all\r\nphantasmagoric. But the great fact was that so much of it was none of\r\nmy business\xe2\x80\x94as I saw my business. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t even now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion turned away on this, and it might well have been yet\r\nagain with the sharpness of a fear of how little his philosophy could\r\nbring her personally. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish _she_ could hear you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Newsome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94not Mrs. Newsome; since I understand you that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter now\r\nwhat Mrs. Newsome hears. Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t she heard everything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPractically\xe2\x80\x94yes.\xe2\x80\x9d He had thought a moment, but he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wish\r\nMadame de Vionnet could hear me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame de Vionnet.\xe2\x80\x9d She had come back to him. \xe2\x80\x9cShe thinks just the\r\ncontrary of what you say. That you distinctly judge her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned over the scene as the two women thus placed together for him\r\nseemed to give it. \xe2\x80\x9cShe might have known\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight have known you don\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Gostrey asked as he let it drop.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was sure of it at first,\xe2\x80\x9d she pursued as he said nothing; \xe2\x80\x9cshe\r\ntook it for granted, at least, as any woman in her position would. But\r\nafter that she changed her mind; she believed you believed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he was curious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy in her sublimity. And that belief had remained with her, I make\r\nout, till the accident of the other day opened your eyes. For that it\r\ndid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maria, \xe2\x80\x9copen them\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe can\xe2\x80\x99t help\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he had taken it up\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbeing aware? No,\xe2\x80\x9d he mused; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsuppose she thinks of that even yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen they _were_ closed? There you are! However, if you see her as the\r\nmost charming woman in the world it comes to the same thing. And if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d like me to tell her that you do still so see her\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Gostrey,\r\nin short, offered herself for service to the end.\r\n\r\nIt was an offer he could temporarily entertain; but he decided. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nknows perfectly how I see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot favourably enough, she mentioned to me, to wish ever to see her\r\nagain. She told me you had taken a final leave of her. She says you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ndone with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaria had a pause; then she spoke as if for conscience. \xe2\x80\x9cShe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave done with _you_. She feels she has lost you\xe2\x80\x94yet that she might\r\nhave been better for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh she has been quite good enough!\xe2\x80\x9d Strether laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe thinks you and she might at any rate have been friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe might certainly. That\xe2\x80\x99s just\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he continued to laugh\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhy I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as if Maria could feel with this then at last that she had done\r\nher best for each. But she had still an idea. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I tell her that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Tell her nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well then.\xe2\x80\x9d To which in the next breath Miss Gostrey added: \xe2\x80\x9cPoor\r\ndear thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer friend wondered; then with raised eyebrows: \xe2\x80\x9cMe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no. Marie de Vionnet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe accepted the correction, but he wondered still. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you so sorry\r\nfor her as that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt made her think a moment\xe2\x80\x94made her even speak with a smile. But she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t really retract. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for us all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n IV\r\n\r\nHe was to delay no longer to re-establish communication with Chad, and\r\nwe have just seen that he had spoken to Miss Gostrey of this intention\r\non hearing from her of the young man\xe2\x80\x99s absence. It was not moreover\r\nonly the assurance so given that prompted him; it was the need of\r\ncausing his conduct to square with another profession still\xe2\x80\x94the motive\r\nhe had described to her as his sharpest for now getting away. If he was\r\nto get away because of some of the relations involved in staying, the\r\ncold attitude toward them might look pedantic in the light of lingering\r\non. He must do both things; he must see Chad, but he must go. The more\r\nhe thought of the former of these duties the more he felt himself make\r\na subject of insistence of the latter. They were alike intensely\r\npresent to him as he sat in front of a quiet little caf\xc3\xa9 into which he\r\nhad dropped on quitting Maria\xe2\x80\x99s entresol. The rain that had spoiled his\r\nevening with her was over; for it was still to him as if his evening\r\n_had_ been spoiled\xe2\x80\x94though it mightn\xe2\x80\x99t have been wholly the rain. It was\r\nlate when he left the caf\xc3\xa9, yet not too late; he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t in any case\r\ngo straight to bed, and he would walk round by the Boulevard\r\nMalesherbes\xe2\x80\x94rather far round\xe2\x80\x94on his way home. Present enough always was\r\nthe small circumstance that had originally pressed for him the spring\r\nof so big a difference\xe2\x80\x94the accident of little Bilham\xe2\x80\x99s appearance on\r\nthe balcony of the mystic troisi\xc3\xa8me at the moment of his first visit,\r\nand the effect of it on his sense of what was then before him. He\r\nrecalled his watch, his wait, and the recognition that had proceeded\r\nfrom the young stranger, that had played frankly into the air and had\r\npresently brought him up\xe2\x80\x94things smoothing the way for his first\r\nstraight step. He had since had occasion, a few times, to pass the\r\nhouse without going in; but he had never passed it without again\r\nfeeling how it had then spoken to him. He stopped short to-night on\r\ncoming to sight of it: it was as if his last day were oddly copying his\r\nfirst. The windows of Chad\xe2\x80\x99s apartment were open to the balcony\xe2\x80\x94a pair\r\nof them lighted; and a figure that had come out and taken up little\r\nBilham\xe2\x80\x99s attitude, a figure whose cigarette-spark he could see leaned\r\non the rail and looked down at him. It denoted however no reappearance\r\nof his younger friend; it quickly defined itself in the tempered\r\ndarkness as Chad\xe2\x80\x99s more solid shape; so that Chad\xe2\x80\x99s was the attention\r\nthat after he had stepped forward into the street and signalled, he\r\neasily engaged; Chad\xe2\x80\x99s was the voice that, sounding into the night with\r\npromptness and seemingly with joy, greeted him and called him up.\r\n\r\nThat the young man had been visible there just in this position\r\nexpressed somehow for Strether that, as Maria Gostrey had reported, he\r\nhad been absent and silent; and our friend drew breath on each\r\nlanding\xe2\x80\x94the lift, at that hour, having ceased to work\xe2\x80\x94before the\r\nimplications of the fact. He had been for a week intensely away, away\r\nto a distance and alone; but he was more back than ever, and the\r\nattitude in which Strether had surprised him was something more than a\r\nreturn\xe2\x80\x94it was clearly a conscious surrender. He had arrived but an hour\r\nbefore, from London, from Lucerne, from Homburg, from no matter\r\nwhere\xe2\x80\x94though the visitor\xe2\x80\x99s fancy, on the staircase, liked to fill it\r\nout; and after a bath, a talk with Baptiste and a supper of light cold\r\nclever French things, which one could see the remains of there in the\r\ncircle of the lamp, pretty and ultra-Parisian, he had come into the air\r\nagain for a smoke, was occupied at the moment of Strether\xe2\x80\x99s approach in\r\nwhat might have been called taking up his life afresh. His life, his\r\nlife!\xe2\x80\x94Strether paused anew, on the last flight, at this final rather\r\nbreathless sense of what Chad\xe2\x80\x99s life was doing with Chad\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nemissary. It was dragging him, at strange hours, up the staircases of\r\nthe rich; it was keeping him out of bed at the end of long hot days; it\r\nwas transforming beyond recognition the simple, subtle, conveniently\r\nuniform thing that had anciently passed with him for a life of his own.\r\nWhy should it concern him that Chad was to be fortified in the pleasant\r\npractice of smoking on balconies, of supping on salads, of feeling his\r\nspecial conditions agreeably reaffirm themselves, of finding\r\nreassurance in comparisons and contrasts? There was no answer to such a\r\nquestion but that he was still practically committed\xe2\x80\x94he had perhaps\r\nnever yet so much known it. It made him feel old, and he would buy his\r\nrailway-ticket\xe2\x80\x94feeling, no doubt, older\xe2\x80\x94the next day; but he had\r\nmeanwhile come up four flights, counting the entresol, at midnight and\r\nwithout a lift, for Chad\xe2\x80\x99s life. The young man, hearing him by this\r\ntime, and with Baptiste sent to rest, was already at the door; so that\r\nStrether had before him in full visibility the cause in which he was\r\nlabouring and even, with the troisi\xc3\xa8me fairly gained, panting a little.\r\n\r\nChad offered him, as always, a welcome in which the cordial and the\r\nformal\xe2\x80\x94so far as the formal was the respectful\xe2\x80\x94handsomely met; and\r\nafter he had expressed a hope that he would let him put him up for the\r\nnight Strether was in full possession of the key, as it might have been\r\ncalled, to what had lately happened. If he had just thought of himself\r\nas old Chad was at sight of him thinking of him as older: he wanted to\r\nput him up for the night just because he was ancient and weary. It\r\ncould never be said the tenant of these quarters wasn\xe2\x80\x99t nice to him; a\r\ntenant who, if he might indeed now keep him, was probably prepared to\r\nwork it all still more thoroughly. Our friend had in fact the\r\nimpression that with the minimum of encouragement Chad would propose to\r\nkeep him indefinitely; an impression in the lap of which one of his own\r\npossibilities seemed to sit. Madame de Vionnet had wished him to\r\nstay\xe2\x80\x94so why didn\xe2\x80\x99t that happily fit? He could enshrine himself for the\r\nrest of his days in his young host\xe2\x80\x99s _chambre d\xe2\x80\x99ami_ and draw out these\r\ndays at his young host\xe2\x80\x99s expense: there could scarce be greater logical\r\nexpression of the countenance he had been moved to give. There was\r\nliterally a minute\xe2\x80\x94it was strange enough\xe2\x80\x94during which he grasped the\r\nidea that as he _was_ acting, as he could only act, he was\r\ninconsistent. The sign that the inward forces he had obeyed really hung\r\ntogether would be that\xe2\x80\x94in default always of another career\xe2\x80\x94he should\r\npromote the good cause by mounting guard on it. These things, during\r\nhis first minutes, came and went; but they were after all practically\r\ndisposed of as soon as he had mentioned his errand. He had come to say\r\ngood-bye\xe2\x80\x94yet that was only a part; so that from the moment Chad\r\naccepted his farewell the question of a more ideal affirmation gave way\r\nto something else. He proceeded with the rest of his business. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe a brute, you know\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll be guilty of the last infamy\xe2\x80\x94if you ever\r\nforsake her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat, uttered there at the solemn hour, uttered in the place that was\r\nfull of her influence, was the rest of his business; and when once he\r\nhad heard himself say it he felt that his message had never before been\r\nspoken. It placed his present call immediately on solid ground, and the\r\neffect of it was to enable him quite to play with what we have called\r\nthe key. Chad showed no shade of embarrassment, but had none the less\r\nbeen troubled for him after their meeting in the country; had had fears\r\nand doubts on the subject of his comfort. He was disturbed, as it were,\r\nonly _for_ him, and had positively gone away to ease him off, to let\r\nhim down\xe2\x80\x94if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t indeed rather to screw him up\xe2\x80\x94the more gently.\r\nSeeing him now fairly jaded he had come, with characteristic good\r\nhumour, all the way to meet him, and what Strether thereupon supremely\r\nmade out was that he would abound for him to the end in conscientious\r\nassurances. This was what was between them while the visitor remained;\r\nso far from having to go over old ground he found his entertainer keen\r\nto agree to everything. It couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be put too strongly for him that\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d be a brute. \xe2\x80\x9cOh rather!\xe2\x80\x94if I should do anything of _that_ sort. I\r\nhope you believe I really feel it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cto be my last word of all to you. I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay more, you know; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how I can do more, in every way,\r\nthan I\xe2\x80\x99ve done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad took this, almost artlessly, as a direct allusion. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve seen\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94to say good-bye. And if I had doubted the truth of what I tell\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99d have cleared up your doubt?\xe2\x80\x9d Chad understood\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9crather\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94again! It\r\neven kept him briefly silent. But he made that up. \xe2\x80\x9cShe must have been\r\nwonderful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe _was_,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether candidly admitted\xe2\x80\x94all of which practically told\r\nas a reference to the conditions created by the accident of the\r\nprevious week.\r\n\r\nThey appeared for a little to be looking back at it; and that came out\r\nstill more in what Chad next said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99ve really\r\nthought, all along; I never did know\xe2\x80\x94for anything, with you, seemed to\r\nbe possible. But of course\xe2\x80\x94of course\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Without confusion, quite with\r\nnothing but indulgence, he broke down, he pulled up. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, you\r\nunderstand. I spoke to you originally only as I _had_ to speak. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonly one way\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t there?\xe2\x80\x94about such things. However,\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled with a\r\nfinal philosophy, \xe2\x80\x9cI see it\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether met his eyes with a sense of multiplying thoughts. What was it\r\nthat made him at present, late at night and after journeys, so\r\nrenewedly, so substantially young? Strether saw in a moment what it\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94it was that he was younger again than Madame de Vionnet. He himself\r\nsaid immediately none of the things that he was thinking; he said\r\nsomething quite different. \xe2\x80\x9cYou _have_ really been to a distance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been to England.\xe2\x80\x9d Chad spoke cheerfully and promptly, but gave no\r\nfurther account of it than to say: \xe2\x80\x9cOne must sometimes get off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether wanted no more facts\xe2\x80\x94he only wanted to justify, as it were,\r\nhis question. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course you do as you\xe2\x80\x99re free to do. But I hope, this\r\ntime, that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t go for _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor very shame at bothering you really too much? My dear man,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad\r\nlaughed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat _wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ I do for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x99s easy answer for this was that it was a disposition he had\r\nexactly come to profit by. \xe2\x80\x9cEven at the risk of being in your way I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nwaited on, you know, for a definite reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad took it in. \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94for us to make if possible a still better\r\nimpression.\xe2\x80\x9d And he stood there happily exhaling his full general\r\nconsciousness. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m delighted to gather that you feel we\xe2\x80\x99ve made it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pleasant irony in the words, which his guest, preoccupied\r\nand keeping to the point, didn\xe2\x80\x99t take up. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had my sense of wanting\r\nthe rest of the time\xe2\x80\x94the time of their being still on this side,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued to explain\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI know now why I wanted it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was as grave, as distinct, as a demonstrator before a blackboard,\r\nand Chad continued to face him like an intelligent pupil. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wanted\r\nto have been put through the whole thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether again, for a moment, said nothing; he turned his eyes away,\r\nand they lost themselves, through the open window, in the dusky outer\r\nair. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall learn from the Bank here where they\xe2\x80\x99re now having their\r\nletters, and my last word, which I shall write in the morning and which\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re expecting as my ultimatum, will so immediately reach them.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nlight of his plural pronoun was sufficiently reflected in his\r\ncompanion\xe2\x80\x99s face as he again met it; and he completed his\r\ndemonstration. He pursued indeed as if for himself. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nfirst to justify what I shall do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re justifying it beautifully!\xe2\x80\x9d Chad declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a question of advising you not to go,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut of\r\nabsolutely preventing you, if possible, from so much as thinking of it.\r\nLet me accordingly appeal to you by all you hold sacred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad showed a surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you think me capable\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d not only be, as I say, a brute; you\xe2\x80\x99d be,\xe2\x80\x9d his companion went on\r\nin the same way, \xe2\x80\x9ca criminal of the deepest dye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad gave a sharper look, as if to gauge a possible suspicion. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what should make you think I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite know either, and such impressions, for the\r\nimaginative mind, were always too fine, too floating, to produce on the\r\nspot their warrant. There was none the less for him, in the very manner\r\nof his host\xe2\x80\x99s allusion to satiety as a thinkable motive, a slight\r\nbreath of the ominous. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel how much more she can do for you. She\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t done it all yet. Stay with her at least till she has.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd leave her _then?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad had kept smiling, but its effect in Strether was a shade of\r\ndryness. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t leave her _before_. When you\xe2\x80\x99ve got all that can be\r\ngot\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t say,\xe2\x80\x9d he added a trifle grimly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat will be the proper\r\ntime. But as, for you, from such a woman, there will always be\r\nsomething to be got, my remark\xe2\x80\x99s not a wrong to her.\xe2\x80\x9d Chad let him go\r\non, showing every decent deference, showing perhaps also a candid\r\ncuriosity for this sharper accent. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember you, you know, as you\r\nwere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn awful ass, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe response was as prompt as if he had pressed a spring; it had a\r\nready abundance at which he even winced; so that he took a moment to\r\nmeet it. \xe2\x80\x9cYou certainly then wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have seemed worth all you\xe2\x80\x99ve let\r\nme in for. You\xe2\x80\x99ve defined yourself better. Your value has quintupled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that be enough\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad had risked it jocosely, but Strether remained blank. \xe2\x80\x9cEnough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf one _should_ wish to live on one\xe2\x80\x99s accumulations?\xe2\x80\x9d After which,\r\nhowever, as his friend appeared cold to the joke, the young man as\r\neasily dropped it. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I really never forget, night or day, what\r\nI owe her. I owe her everything. I give you my word of honour,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nfrankly rang out, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99m not a bit tired of her.\xe2\x80\x9d Strether at this\r\nonly gave him a stare: the way youth could express itself was again and\r\nagain a wonder. He meant no harm, though he might after all be capable\r\nof much; yet he spoke of being \xe2\x80\x9ctired\xe2\x80\x9d of her almost as he might have\r\nspoken of being tired of roast mutton for dinner. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has never for a\r\nmoment yet bored me\xe2\x80\x94never been wanting, as the cleverest women\r\nsometimes are, in tact. She has never talked about her tact\xe2\x80\x94as even\r\nthey too sometimes talk; but she has always had it. She has never had\r\nit more\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he handsomely made the point\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthan just lately.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\nscrupulously went further. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has never been anything I could call a\r\nburden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether for a moment said nothing; then he spoke gravely, with his\r\nshade of dryness deepened. \xe2\x80\x9cOh if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t do her justice\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _should_ be a beast, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether devoted no time to saying what he would be; _that_, visibly,\r\nwould take them far. If there was nothing for it but to repeat,\r\nhowever, repetition was no mistake. \xe2\x80\x9cYou owe her everything\xe2\x80\x94very much\r\nmore than she can ever owe you. You\xe2\x80\x99ve in other words duties to her, of\r\nthe most positive sort; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t see what other duties\xe2\x80\x94as the others\r\nare presented to you\xe2\x80\x94can be held to go before them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad looked at him with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you know of course about the\r\nothers, eh?\xe2\x80\x94since it\xe2\x80\x99s you yourself who have done the presenting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch of it\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94and to the best of my ability. But not all\xe2\x80\x94from the\r\nmoment your sister took my place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Chad returned. \xe2\x80\x9cSally took a place, certainly; but it was\r\nnever, I saw from the first moment, to be yours. No one\xe2\x80\x94with us\xe2\x80\x94will\r\never take yours. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh of course,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew it. I believe you\xe2\x80\x99re right. No\r\none in the world, I imagine, was ever so portentously solemn. There I\r\nam,\xe2\x80\x9d he added with another sigh, as if weary enough, on occasion, of\r\nthis truth. \xe2\x80\x9cI was made so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad appeared for a little to consider the way he was made; he might\r\nfor this purpose have measured him up and down. His conclusion favoured\r\nthe fact. \xe2\x80\x9c_You_ have never needed any one to make you better. There\r\nhas never been any one good enough. They couldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\nHis friend hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon. They _have_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad showed, not without amusement, his doubt. \xe2\x80\x9cWho then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether\xe2\x80\x94though a little dimly\xe2\x80\x94smiled at him. \xe2\x80\x9cWomen\xe2\x80\x94too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Two\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Chad stared and laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cOh I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe, for such work,\r\nin any more than one! So you\xe2\x80\x99re proving too much. And what _is_\r\nbeastly, at all events,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cis losing you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether had set himself in motion for departure, but at this he\r\npaused. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you afraid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfraid\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf doing wrong. I mean away from my eye.\xe2\x80\x9d Before Chad could speak,\r\nhowever, he had taken himself up. \xe2\x80\x9cI _am_, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cprodigious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you spoil us for all the stupid\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d This might have been, on\r\nChad\xe2\x80\x99s part, in its extreme emphasis, almost too freely extravagant;\r\nbut it was full, plainly enough, of the intention of comfort, it\r\ncarried with it a protest against doubt and a promise, positively, of\r\nperformance. Picking up a hat in the vestibule he came out with his\r\nfriend, came downstairs, took his arm, affectionately, as to help and\r\nguide him, treating him if not exactly as aged and infirm, yet as a\r\nnoble eccentric who appealed to tenderness, and keeping on with him,\r\nwhile they walked, to the next corner and the next. \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nme, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94this again as they proceeded, he wished to\r\nmake Strether feel. What he needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell him was now at last, in the\r\ngeniality of separation, anything at all it concerned him to know. He\r\nknew, up to the hilt\xe2\x80\x94that really came over Chad; he understood, felt,\r\nrecorded his vow; and they lingered on it as they had lingered in their\r\nwalk to Strether\xe2\x80\x99s hotel the night of their first meeting. The latter\r\ntook, at this hour, all he could get; he had given all he had had to\r\ngive; he was as depleted as if he had spent his last sou. But there was\r\njust one thing for which, before they broke off, Chad seemed disposed\r\nslightly to bargain. His companion needn\xe2\x80\x99t, as he said, tell him, but\r\nhe might himself mention that he had been getting some news of the art\r\nof advertisement. He came out quite suddenly with this announcement\r\nwhile Strether wondered if his revived interest were what had taken\r\nhim, with strange inconsequence, over to London. He appeared at all\r\nevents to have been looking into the question and had encountered a\r\nrevelation. Advertising scientifically worked presented itself thus as\r\nthe great new force. \xe2\x80\x9cIt really does the thing, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were face to face under the street-lamp as they had been the first\r\nnight, and Strether, no doubt, looked blank. \xe2\x80\x9cAffects, you mean, the\r\nsale of the object advertised?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94but affects it extraordinarily; really beyond what one had\r\nsupposed. I mean of course when it\xe2\x80\x99s done as one makes out that in our\r\nroaring age, it _can_ be done. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been finding out a little, though\r\nit doubtless doesn\xe2\x80\x99t amount to much more than what you originally, so\r\nawfully vividly\xe2\x80\x94and all, very nearly, that first night\xe2\x80\x94put before me.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s an art like another, and infinite like all the arts.\xe2\x80\x9d He went on\r\nas if for the joke of it\xe2\x80\x94almost as if his friend\xe2\x80\x99s face amused him. \xe2\x80\x9cIn\r\nthe hands, naturally, of a master. The right man must take hold. With\r\nthe right man to work it _c\xe2\x80\x99est un monde_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether had watched him quite as if, there on the pavement without a\r\npretext, he had begun to dance a fancy step. \xe2\x80\x9cIs what you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking\r\nof that you yourself, in the case you have in mind, would be the right\r\nman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad had thrown back his light coat and thrust each of his thumbs into\r\nan armhole of his waistcoat; in which position his fingers played up\r\nand down. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what is he but what you yourself, as I say, took me for\r\nwhen you first came out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether felt a little faint, but he coerced his attention. \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\r\nand there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that, with your natural parts, you\xe2\x80\x99d have much in\r\ncommon with him. Advertising is clearly at this time of day the secret\r\nof trade. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite possible it will be open to you\xe2\x80\x94giving the whole\r\nof your mind to it\xe2\x80\x94to make the whole place hum with you. Your mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nappeal is to the whole of your mind, and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the strength of\r\nher case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad\xe2\x80\x99s fingers continued to twiddle, but he had something of a drop.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh we\xe2\x80\x99ve been through my mother\xe2\x80\x99s case!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I thought. Why then do you speak of the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly because it was part of our original discussion. To wind up where\r\nwe began, my interest\xe2\x80\x99s purely platonic. There at any rate the fact\r\nis\xe2\x80\x94the fact of the possible. I mean the money in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh damn the money in it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether. And then as the young man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfixed smile seemed to shine out more strange: \xe2\x80\x9cShall you give your\r\nfriend up for the money in it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChad preserved his handsome grimace as well as the rest of his\r\nattitude. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not altogether\xe2\x80\x94in your so great \xe2\x80\x98solemnity\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94kind.\r\nHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I been drinking you in\xe2\x80\x94showing you all I feel you\xe2\x80\x99re worth to\r\nme? What have I done, what am I doing, but cleave to her to the death?\r\nThe only thing is,\xe2\x80\x9d he good-humouredly explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthat one can\xe2\x80\x99t but\r\nhave it before one, in the cleaving\xe2\x80\x94the point where the death comes in.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid for _that_. It\xe2\x80\x99s pleasant to a fellow\xe2\x80\x99s feelings,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ndeveloped, \xe2\x80\x9cto \xe2\x80\x98size-up\xe2\x80\x99 the bribe he applies his foot to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh then if all you want\xe2\x80\x99s a kickable surface the bribe\xe2\x80\x99s enormous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. Then there it goes!\xe2\x80\x9d Chad administered his kick with fantastic\r\nforce and sent an imaginary object flying. It was accordingly as if\r\nthey were once more rid of the question and could come back to what\r\nreally concerned him. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I shall see you tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Strether scarce heeded the plan proposed for this; he had still the\r\nimpression\xe2\x80\x94not the slighter for the simulated kick\xe2\x80\x94of an irrelevant\r\nhornpipe or jig. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re restless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Chad as they parted, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re exciting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n V\r\n\r\nHe had, however, within two days, another separation to face. He had\r\nsent Maria Gostrey a word early, by hand, to ask if he might come to\r\nbreakfast; in consequence of which, at noon, she awaited him in the\r\ncool shade of her little Dutch-looking dining-room. This retreat was at\r\nthe back of the house, with a view of a scrap of old garden that had\r\nbeen saved from modern ravage; and though he had on more than one other\r\noccasion had his legs under its small and peculiarly polished table of\r\nhospitality, the place had never before struck him as so sacred to\r\npleasant knowledge, to intimate charm, to antique order, to a neatness\r\nthat was almost august. To sit there was, as he had told his hostess\r\nbefore, to see life reflected for the time in ideally kept pewter;\r\nwhich was somehow becoming, improving to life, so that one\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were\r\nheld and comforted. Strether\xe2\x80\x99s were comforted at all events now\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\nmore that it was the last time\xe2\x80\x94with the charming effect, on the board\r\nbare of a cloth and proud of its perfect surface, of the small old\r\ncrockery and old silver, matched by the more substantial pieces happily\r\ndisposed about the room. The specimens of vivid Delf, in particular had\r\nthe dignity of family portraits; and it was in the midst of them that\r\nour friend resignedly expressed himself. He spoke even with a certain\r\nphilosophic humour. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more to wait for; I seem to have\r\ndone a good day\xe2\x80\x99s work. I\xe2\x80\x99ve let them have it all round. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen\r\nChad, who has been to London and come back. He tells me I\xe2\x80\x99m \xe2\x80\x98exciting,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand I seem indeed pretty well to have upset every one. I\xe2\x80\x99ve at any rate\r\nexcited _him_. He\xe2\x80\x99s distinctly restless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve excited _me_,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Gostrey smiled. \xe2\x80\x9c_I\xe2\x80\x99m_ distinctly\r\nrestless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you were that when I found you. It seems to me I\xe2\x80\x99ve rather got you\r\nout of it. What\xe2\x80\x99s this,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked as he looked about him, \xe2\x80\x9cbut a haunt\r\nof ancient peace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish with all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d she presently replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI could make you\r\ntreat it as a haven of rest.\xe2\x80\x9d On which they fronted each other, across\r\nthe table, as if things unuttered were in the air.\r\n\r\nStrether seemed, in his way, when he next spoke, to take some of them\r\nup. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give me\xe2\x80\x94that would be the trouble\xe2\x80\x94what it will, no\r\ndoubt, still give you. I\xe2\x80\x99m not,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, leaning back in his\r\nchair, but with his eyes on a small ripe round melon\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cin real harmony\r\nwith what surrounds me. You _are_. I take it too hard. You _don\xe2\x80\x99t_. It\r\nmakes\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what it comes to in the end\xe2\x80\x94a fool of me.\xe2\x80\x9d Then at a\r\ntangent, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has he been doing in London?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh one may go to London,\xe2\x80\x9d Maria laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know _I_ did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes\xe2\x80\x94he took the reminder. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you brought _me_ back.\xe2\x80\x9d He brooded there\r\nopposite to her, but without gloom. \xe2\x80\x9cWhom has Chad brought? He\xe2\x80\x99s full\r\nof ideas. And I wrote to Sarah,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cthe first thing this\r\nmorning. So I\xe2\x80\x99m square. I\xe2\x80\x99m ready for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe neglected certain parts of this speech in the interest of others.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarie said to me the other day that she felt him to have the makings\r\nof an immense man of business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is. He\xe2\x80\x99s the son of his father!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _such_ a father!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh just the right one from that point of view! But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t his father\r\nin him,\xe2\x80\x9d Strether added, \xe2\x80\x9cthat troubles me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it then?\xe2\x80\x9d He came back to his breakfast; he partook presently\r\nof the charming melon, which she liberally cut for him; and it was only\r\nafter this that he met her question. Then moreover it was but to remark\r\nthat he\xe2\x80\x99d answer her presently. She waited, she watched, she served him\r\nand amused him, and it was perhaps with this last idea that she soon\r\nreminded him of his having never even yet named to her the article\r\nproduced at Woollett. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember our talking of it in London\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nnight at the play?\xe2\x80\x9d Before he could say yes, however, she had put it to\r\nhim for other matters. Did he remember, did he remember\xe2\x80\x94this and that\r\nof their first days? He remembered everything, bringing up with humour\r\neven things of which she professed no recollection, things she\r\nvehemently denied; and falling back above all on the great interest of\r\ntheir early time, the curiosity felt by both of them as to where he\r\nwould \xe2\x80\x9ccome out.\xe2\x80\x9d They had so assumed it was to be in some wonderful\r\nplace\xe2\x80\x94they had thought of it as so very _much_ out. Well, that was\r\ndoubtless what it had been\xe2\x80\x94since he had come out just there. He was\r\nout, in truth, as far as it was possible to be, and must now rather\r\nbethink himself of getting in again. He found on the spot the image of\r\nhis recent history; he was like one of the figures of the old clock at\r\nBerne. _They_ came out, on one side, at their hour, jigged along their\r\nlittle course in the public eye, and went in on the other side. He too\r\nhad jigged his little course\xe2\x80\x94him too a modest retreat awaited. He\r\noffered now, should she really like to know, to name the great product\r\nof Woollett. It would be a great commentary on everything. At this she\r\nstopped him off; she not only had no wish to know, but she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow for the world. She had done with the products of Woollett\xe2\x80\x94for all\r\nthe good she had got from them. She desired no further news of them,\r\nand she mentioned that Madame de Vionnet herself had, to her knowledge,\r\nlived exempt from the information he was ready to supply. She had never\r\nconsented to receive it, though she would have taken it, under stress,\r\nfrom Mrs. Pocock. But it was a matter about which Mrs. Pocock appeared\r\nto have had little to say\xe2\x80\x94never sounding the word\xe2\x80\x94and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t signify\r\nnow. There was nothing clearly for Maria Gostrey that signified\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94save one sharp point, that is, to which she came in time. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow whether it\xe2\x80\x99s before you as a possibility that, left to himself,\r\nMr. Chad may after all go back. I judge that it _is_ more or less so\r\nbefore you, from what you just now said of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer guest had his eyes on her, kindly but attentively, as if foreseeing\r\nwhat was to follow this. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will be for the money.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthen as she seemed uncertain: \xe2\x80\x9cI mean I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it will be for\r\nthat he\xe2\x80\x99ll give her up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he _will_ give her up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrether waited a moment, rather slow and deliberate now, drawing out a\r\nlittle this last soft stage, pleading with her in various suggestive\r\nand unspoken ways for patience and understanding. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat were you just\r\nabout to ask me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything he can do that would make you patch it up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith Mrs. Newsome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer assent, as if she had had a delicacy about sounding the name, was\r\nonly in her face; but she added with it: \xe2\x80\x9cOr is there anything he can\r\ndo that would make _her_ try it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo patch it up with me?\xe2\x80\x9d His answer came at last in a conclusive\r\nheadshake. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing any one can do. It\xe2\x80\x99s over. Over for both of\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaria wondered, seemed a little to doubt. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you so sure for her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94sure now. Too much has happened. I\xe2\x80\x99m different for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took it in then, drawing a deeper breath. \xe2\x80\x9cI see. So that as she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndifferent for _you_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but,\xe2\x80\x9d he interrupted, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xe2\x80\x9d And as Miss Gostrey wondered\r\nagain: \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s the same. She\xe2\x80\x99s more than ever the same. But I do what I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t before\xe2\x80\x94I _see_ her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke gravely and as if responsibly\xe2\x80\x94since he had to pronounce; and\r\nthe effect of it was slightly solemn, so that she simply exclaimed\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d Satisfied and grateful, however, she showed in her own next words\r\nan acceptance of his statement. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat then do you go home to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had pushed his plate a little away, occupied with another side of\r\nthe matter; taking refuge verily in that side and feeling so moved that\r\nhe soon found himself on his feet. He was affected in advance by what\r\nhe believed might come from her, and he would have liked to forestall\r\nit and deal with it tenderly; yet in the presence of it he wished still\r\nmore to be\xe2\x80\x94though as smoothly as possible\xe2\x80\x94deterrent and conclusive. He\r\nput her question by for the moment; he told her more about Chad. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwould have been impossible to meet me more than he did last night on\r\nthe question of the infamy of not sticking to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that what you called it for him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98infamy\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh rather! I described to him in detail the base creature he\xe2\x80\x99d be, and\r\nhe quite agrees with me about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that it\xe2\x80\x99s really as if you had nailed him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite really as if\xe2\x80\x94! I told him I should curse him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she smiled, \xe2\x80\x9cyou _have_ done it.\xe2\x80\x9d And then having thought again:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ after that propose\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d Yet she scanned his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPropose again to Mrs. Newsome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated afresh, but she brought it out. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never believed, you\r\nknow, that you did propose. I always believed it was really she\xe2\x80\x94and, so\r\nfar as that goes, I can understand it. What I mean is,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat with such a spirit\xe2\x80\x94the spirit of curses!\xe2\x80\x94your breach is past\r\nmending. She has only to know what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done to him never again to\r\nraise a finger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat I could\xe2\x80\x94one can\xe2\x80\x99t do more. He\r\nprotests his devotion and his horror. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99ve saved him.\r\nHe protests too much. He asks how one can dream of his being tired. But\r\nhe has all life before him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaria saw what he meant. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s formed to please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s our friend who has formed him.\xe2\x80\x9d Strether felt in it the\r\nstrange irony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it\xe2\x80\x99s scarcely his fault!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s at any rate his danger. I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s hers. But\r\nshe knows it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she knows it. And is your idea,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Gostrey asked, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there\r\nwas some other woman in London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. No. That is I _have_ no ideas. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of them. I\xe2\x80\x99ve done with\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d And he put out his hand to her. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt brought her back to her unanswered question. \xe2\x80\x9cTo what do you go\r\nhome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. There will always be something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo a great difference,\xe2\x80\x9d she said as she kept his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great difference\xe2\x80\x94no doubt. Yet I shall see what I can make of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall you make anything so good\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d But, as if remembering what Mrs.\r\nNewsome had done, it was as far as she went.\r\n\r\nHe had sufficiently understood. \xe2\x80\x9cSo good as this place at this moment?\r\nSo good as what _you_ make of everything you touch?\xe2\x80\x9d He took a moment\r\nto say, for, really and truly, what stood about him there in her\r\noffer\xe2\x80\x94which was as the offer of exquisite service, of lightened care,\r\nfor the rest of his days\xe2\x80\x94might well have tempted. It built him softly\r\nround, it roofed him warmly over, it rested, all so firm, on selection.\r\nAnd what ruled selection was beauty and knowledge. It was awkward, it\r\nwas almost stupid, not to seem to prize such things; yet, none the\r\nless, so far as they made his opportunity they made it only for a\r\nmoment. She\xe2\x80\x99d moreover understand\xe2\x80\x94she always understood.\r\n\r\nThat indeed might be, but meanwhile she was going on. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing,\r\nyou know, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cin all the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know. I know. But all the same I must go.\xe2\x80\x9d He had got it at last.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had echoed it in vague deprecation, but he felt it already clear\r\nfor her. \xe2\x80\x9cThat, you see, is my only logic. Not, out of the whole\r\naffair, to have got anything for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe thought. \xe2\x80\x9cBut with your wonderful impressions you\xe2\x80\x99ll have got a\r\ngreat deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great deal\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut nothing like _you_. It\xe2\x80\x99s you who would\r\nmake me wrong!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHonest and fine, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t greatly pretend she didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it. Still\r\nshe could pretend just a little. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why should you be so dreadfully\r\nright?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way that\xe2\x80\x94if I must go\xe2\x80\x94you yourself would be the first to\r\nwant me. And I can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo then she had to take it, though still with her defeated protest. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t so much your _being_ \xe2\x80\x98right\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s your horrible sharp eye for\r\nwhat makes you so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh but you\xe2\x80\x99re just as bad yourself. You can\xe2\x80\x99t resist me when I point\r\nthat out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sighed it at last all comically, all tragically, away. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nindeed resist you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen there we are!\xe2\x80\x9d said Strether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE AMBASSADORS ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
