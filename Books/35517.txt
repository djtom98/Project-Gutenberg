She was\r\nquite young, with a quaint and piquant rather than a beautiful face, and\r\nher eyes were of a shining hazel. She held a neat paper parcel in one\r\nhand, and laughed with her friends.\r\n\r\n"Leave the door open," said the smooth man to the other, as they were\r\ngoing out. "Yes, by----," he went on with an ugly oath. "We\'ll leave the\r\nfront door on the jar. He may like to see company, you know."\r\n\r\nThe other man looked doubtfully about him. "Is it quite prudent do you\r\nthink, Davies?" he said, pausing with his hand on the mouldering\r\nknocker. "I don\'t think Lipsius would like it. What do you say, Helen?"\r\n\r\n"I agree with Davies. Davies is an artist, and you are commonplace,\r\nRichmond, and a bit of a coward. Let the door stand open, of course. But\r\nwhat a pity Lipsius had to go away! He would have enjoyed himself."\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied the smooth Mr. Davies, "that summons to the west was very\r\nhard on the doctor."\r\n\r\nThe three passed out, leaving the hall door, cracked and riven with\r\nfrost and wet, half open, and they stood silent for a moment under the\r\nruinous shelter of the porch.\r\n\r\n"Well," said the girl, "it is done at last. I shall hurry no more on the\r\ntrack of the young man with spectacles."\r\n\r\n"We owe a great deal to you," said Mr. Davies politely; "the doctor said\r\nso before he left. But have we not all three some farewells to make? I,\r\nfor my part, propose to say good-by, here, before this picturesque but\r\nmouldy residence, to my friend Mr. Burton, dealer in the antique and\r\ncurious," and the man lifted his hat with an exaggerated bow.\r\n\r\n"And I," said Richmond, "bid adieu to Mr. Wilkins, the private\r\nsecretary, whose company has, I confess, become a little tedious."\r\n\r\n"Farewell to Miss Lally, and to Miss Leicester also," said the girl,\r\nmaking as she spoke a delicious courtesy. "Farewell to all occult\r\nadventure; the farce is played."\r\n\r\nMr. Davies and the lady seemed full of grim enjoyment, but Richmond\r\ntugged at his whiskers nervously.\r\n\r\n"I feel a bit shaken up," he said. "I\'ve seen rougher things in the\r\nStates, but that crying noise he made gave me a sickish feeling. And\r\nthen the smell--But my stomach was never very strong."\r\n\r\nThe three friends moved away from the door, and began to walk slowly up\r\nand down what had been a gravel path, but now lay green and pulpy with\r\ndamp mosses. It was a fine autumn evening, and a faint sunlight shone on\r\nthe yellow walls of the old deserted house, and showed the patches of\r\ngangrenous decay, and all the stains, the black drift of rain from the\r\nbroken pipes, the scabrous blots where the bare bricks were exposed, the\r\ngreen weeping of a gaunt laburnum that stood beside the porch, and\r\nragged marks near the ground where the reeking clay was gaining on the\r\nworn foundations. It was a queer rambling old place, the centre perhaps\r\ntwo hundred years old, with dormer windows sloping from the tiled roof,\r\nand on each side there were Georgian wings; bow windows had been carried\r\nup to the first floor, and two dome-like cupolas that had once been\r\npainted a bright green were now gray and neutral. Broken urns lay upon\r\nthe path, and a heavy mist seemed to rise from the unctuous clay; the\r\nneglected shrubberies, grown all tangled and unshapen, smelt dank and\r\nevil, and there was an atmosphere all about the deserted mansion that\r\nproposed thoughts of an opened grave. The three friends looked dismally\r\nat the rough grasses and the nettles that grew thick over lawn and\r\nflower-beds; and at the sad water-pool in the midst of the weeds. There,\r\nabove green and oily scum instead of lilies, stood a rusting Triton on\r\nthe rocks, sounding a dirge through a shattered horn; and beyond, beyond\r\nthe sunk fence and the far meadows; the sun slid down and shone red\r\nthrough the bars of the elm trees.\r\n\r\nRichmond shivered and stamped his foot. "We had better be going soon,"\r\nhe said; "there is nothing else to be done here."\r\n\r\n"No," said Davies, "it is finished at last. I thought for some time we\r\nshould never get hold of the gentleman with the spectacles. He was a\r\nclever fellow, but, Lord! he broke up badly at last. I can tell you he\r\nlooked white at me when I touched him on the arm in the bar. But where\r\ncould he have hidden the thing? We can all swear it was not on him."\r\n\r\nThe girl laughed, and they turned away, when Richmond gave a violent\r\nstart. "Ah!" he cried, turning to the girl, "what have you got there?\r\nLook, Davies, look! it\'s all oozing and dripping."\r\n\r\nThe young woman glanced down at the little parcel she was carrying, and\r\npartially unfolded the paper.\r\n\r\n"Yes, look both of you," she said; "it\'s my own idea. Don\'t you think it\r\nwill do nicely for the doctor\'s museum? It comes from the right hand,\r\nthe hand that took the gold Tiberius."\r\n\r\nMr. Davies nodded with a good deal of approbation, and Richmond lifted\r\nhis ugly high-crowned bowler, and wiped his forehead with a dingy\r\nhandkerchief.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going," he said; "you two can stay if you like."\r\n\r\nThe three went round by the stable path, past the withered wilderness of\r\nthe old kitchen garden, and struck off by a hedge at the back, making\r\nfor a particular point in the road. About five minutes later two\r\ngentlemen, whom idleness had led to explore these forgotten outskirts of\r\nLondon, came sauntering up the shadowy carriage drive. They had spied\r\nthe deserted house from the road, and as they observed all the heavy\r\ndesolation of the place they began to moralize in the great style, with\r\nconsiderable debts to Jeremy Taylor.\r\n\r\n"Look, Dyson," said the one as they drew nearer, "look at those upper\r\nwindows; the sun is setting, and though the panes are dusty, yet\r\n\r\n     "The grimy sash an oriel burns."\r\n\r\n"Phillipps," replied the elder and (it must be said) the more pompous of\r\nthe two, "I yield to fantasy, I cannot withstand the influence of the\r\ngrotesque. Here, where all is falling into dimness and dissolution, and\r\nwe walk in cedarn gloom, and the very air of heaven goes mouldering to\r\nthe lungs, I cannot remain commonplace. I look at that deep glow on the\r\npanes, and the house lies all enchanted; that very room, I tell you, is\r\nwithin all blood and fire."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVENTURE OF THE GOLD TIBERIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe acquaintance between Mr. Dyson and Mr. Charles Phillipps arose from\r\none of those myriad chances which are every day doing their work in the\r\nstreets of London. Mr. Dyson was a man of letters, and an unhappy\r\ninstance of talents misapplied. With gifts that might have placed him in\r\nthe flower of his youth among the most favored of Bentley\'s favorite\r\nnovelists, he had chosen to be perverse; he was, it is true, familiar\r\nwith scholastic logic, but he knew nothing of the logic of life, and he\r\nflattered himself with the title of artist, when he was in fact but an\r\nidle and curious spectator of other men\'s endeavors. Amongst many\r\ndelusions, he cherished one most fondly, that he was a strenuous worker;\r\nand it was with a gesture of supreme weariness that he would enter his\r\nfavorite resort, a small tobacco shop in Great Queen Street, and\r\nproclaim to any one who cared to listen that he had seen the rising and\r\nsetting of two successive suns. The proprietor of the shop, a\r\nmiddle-aged man of singular civility, tolerated Dyson partly out of good\r\nnature, and partly because he was a regular customer; he was allowed to\r\nsit on an empty cask, and to express his sentiments on literary and\r\nartistic matters till he was tired or the time for closing came; and if\r\nno fresh customers were attracted, it is believed that none were turned\r\naway by his eloquence. Dyson, was addicted to wild experiments in\r\ntobacco; he never wearied of trying new combinations, and one evening he\r\nhad just entered the shop and given utterance to his last preposterous\r\nformula, when a young fellow, of about his own age, who had come in a\r\nmoment later, asked the shopman to duplicate the order on his account,\r\nsmiling politely, as he spoke, to Mr. Dyson\'s address. Dyson felt\r\nprofoundly flattered, and after a few phrases the two entered into\r\nconversation, and in an hour\'s time the tobacconist saw the new friends\r\nsitting side by side on a couple of casks, deep in talk.\r\n\r\n"My dear sir," said Dyson, "I will give you the task of the literary man\r\nin a phrase. He has got to do simply this: to invent a wonderful story,\r\nand to tell it in a wonderful manner."\r\n\r\n"I will grant you that," said Mr. Phillipps, "but you will allow me to\r\ninsist that in the hands of the true artist in words all stories are\r\nmarvellous, and every circumstance has its peculiar wonder. The matter\r\nis of little consequence, the manner is everything. Indeed, the highest\r\nskill is shown in taking matter apparently commonplace and transmuting\r\nit by the high alchemy of style into the pure gold of art."\r\n\r\n"That is indeed a proof of great skill, but it is great skill exerted\r\nfoolishly, or at least unadvisedly. It is as if a great violinist were\r\nto show us what marvellous harmonies he could draw from a child\'s\r\nbanjo."\r\n\r\n"No, no, you are really wrong. I see you take a radically mistaken view\r\nof life. But we must thresh this out. Come to my rooms; I live not far\r\nfrom here."\r\n\r\nIt was thus that Mr. Dyson became the associate of Mr. Charles\r\nPhillipps, who lived in a quiet square not far from Holborn. Thenceforth\r\nthey haunted each other\'s rooms at intervals, sometimes regular, and\r\noccasionally the reverse, and made appointments to meet at the shop in\r\nQueen Street, where their talk robbed the tobacconist\'s profit of half\r\nits charm. There was a constant jarring of literary formulas, Dyson\r\nexalting the claims of the pure imagination, while Phillipps, who was a\r\nstudent of physical science and something of an ethnologist, insisted\r\nthat all literature ought to have a scientific basis. By the mistaken\r\nbenevolence of deceased relatives both young men were placed out of\r\nreach of hunger, and so, meditating high achievements, idled their time\r\npleasantly away, and revelled in the careless joys of a Bohemianism\r\ndevoid of the sharp seasoning of adversity.\r\n\r\nOne night in June Mr. Phillipps was sitting in his room in the calm\r\nretirement of Red Lion Square. He had opened the window, and was smoking\r\nplacidly, while he watched the movement of life below. The sky was\r\nclear, and the afterglow of sunset had lingered long about it; and the\r\nflushing twilight of a summer evening, vying with the gas-lamps in the\r\nsquare, had fashioned a chiaroscuro that had in it something unearthly;\r\nand the children, racing to and fro upon the pavement, the lounging\r\nidlers by the public, and the casual passers-by rather flickered, and\r\nhovered in the play of lights than stood out substantial things. By\r\ndegrees in the houses opposite one window after another leaped out a\r\nsquare of light, now and again a figure would shape itself against a\r\nblind and vanish, and to all this semi-theatrical magic the runs and\r\nflourishes of brave Italian opera played a little distance off on a\r\npiano-organ seemed an appropriate accompaniment, while the deep-muttered\r\nbass of the traffic of Holborn never ceased. Phillipps enjoyed the scene\r\nand its effects; the light in the sky faded and turned to darkness, and\r\nthe square gradually grew silent, and still he sat dreaming at the\r\nwindow, till the sharp peal of the house bell roused him, and looking at\r\nhis watch he found that it was past ten o\'clock. There was a knock at\r\nthe door, and his friend Mr. Dyson entered, and, according to his\r\ncustom, sat down in an armchair and began to smoke in silence.\r\n\r\n"You know, Phillipps," he said at length, "that I have always battled\r\nfor the marvellous. I remember your maintaining in that chair that one\r\nhas no business to make use of the wonderful, the improbable, the odd\r\ncoincidence in literature, and you took the ground that it was wrong to\r\ndo so, because, as a matter of fact, the wonderful and the improbable\r\ndon\'t happen, and men\'s lives are not really shaped by odd coincidence.\r\nNow, mind you, if that were so, I would not grant your conclusion,\r\nbecause I think the "criticism-of-life" theory is all nonsense; but I\r\ndeny your premise. A most singular thing has happened to me to-night."\r\n\r\n"Really, Dyson, I am very glad to hear it. Of course I oppose your\r\nargument, whatever it may be; but if you would be good enough to tell me\r\nof your adventure I should be delighted."\r\n\r\n"Well, it came about like this. I have had a very hard day\'s work;\r\nindeed, I have scarcely moved from my old bureau since seven o\'clock\r\nlast night. I wanted to work out that idea we discussed last Tuesday,\r\nyou know, the notion of the fetish-worshipper."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I remember. Have you been able to do anything with it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; it came out better than I expected; but there were great\r\ndifficulties, the usual agony between the conception and the execution.\r\nAnyhow I got it done at about seven o\'clock to-night, and I thought I\r\nshould like a little of the fresh air. I went out and wandered rather\r\naimlessly about the streets; my head was full of my tale, and I didn\'t\r\nmuch notice where I was going. I got into those quiet places to the\r\nnorth of Oxford Street as you go west, the genteel residential\r\nneighborhood of stucco and prosperity. I turned east again without\r\nknowing it, and it was quite dark when I passed along a sombre little\r\nby-street, ill lighted and empty. I did not know at the time in the\r\nleast where I was, but I found out afterwards that it was not very far\r\nfrom Tottenham Court Road. I strolled idly along, enjoying the\r\nstillness; on one side there seemed to be the back premises of some\r\ngreat shop; tier after tier of dusty windows lifted up into the night,\r\nwith gibbet-like contrivances for raising heavy goods, and below large\r\ndoors, fast closed and bolted, all dark and desolate. Then there came a\r\nhuge pantechnicon warehouse; and over the way a grim blank wall, as\r\nforbidding as the wall of a jail, and then the headquarters of some\r\nvolunteer regiment, and afterwards a passage leading to a court where\r\nwagons were standing to be hired. It was, one might almost say, a street\r\ndevoid of inhabitants, and scarce a window showed the glimmer of a\r\nlight. I was wondering at the strange peace and dimness there, where it\r\nmust be close to some roaring main artery of London life, when suddenly\r\nI heard the noise of dashing feet tearing along the pavement at full\r\nspeed, and from a narrow passage, a mews or something of that kind, a\r\nman was discharged as from a catapult under my very nose and rushed past\r\nme, flinging something from him as he ran. He was gone and down another\r\nstreet in an instant, almost before I knew what had happened, but I\r\ndidn\'t much bother about him, I was watching something else. I told you\r\nhe had thrown something away; well, I watched what seemed a line of\r\nflame flash through the air and fly quivering over the pavement, and in\r\nspite of myself I could not help tearing after it. The impetus lessened,\r\nand I saw something like a bright half-penny roll slower and slower, and\r\nthen deflect towards the gutter, hover for a moment on the edge, and\r\ndance down into a drain. I believe I cried out in positive despair,\r\nthough I hadn\'t the least notion what I was hunting; and then to my joy\r\nI saw that, instead of dropping into the sewer, it had fallen flat\r\nacross two bars. I stooped down and picked it up and whipped it into my\r\npocket, and I was just about to walk on when I heard again that sound of\r\ndashing footsteps. I don\'t know why I did it, but as a matter of fact I\r\ndived down into the mews, or whatever it was, and stood as much in the\r\nshadow as possible. A man went by with a rush a few paces from where I\r\nwas standing, and I felt uncommonly pleased that I was in hiding. I\r\ncouldn\'t make out much feature, but I saw his eyes gleaming and his\r\nteeth showing, and he had an ugly-looking knife in one hand, and I\r\nthought things would be very unpleasant for gentleman number one if the\r\nsecond robber, or robbed, or what you like, caught him up. I can tell\r\nyou, Phillipps, a fox hunt is exciting enough, when the horn blows clear\r\non a winter morning, and the hounds give tongue, and the red-coats\r\ncharge away, but it\'s nothing to a man hunt, and that\'s what I had a\r\nslight glimpse of to-night. There was murder in the fellow\'s eyes as he\r\nwent by, and I don\'t think there was much more than fifty seconds\r\nbetween the two. I only hope it was enough."\r\n\r\nDyson leant back in his armchair and relit his pipe, and puffed\r\nthoughtfully. Phillipps began to walk up and down the room, musing over\r\nthe story of violent death fleeting in chase along the pavement, the\r\nknife shining in the lamplight, the fury of the pursuer, and the terror\r\nof the pursued.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said at last, "and what was it, after all, that you rescued\r\nfrom the gutter?"\r\n\r\nDyson jumped up, evidently quite startled. "I really haven\'t a notion. I\r\ndidn\'t think of looking. But we shall see."\r\n\r\nHe fumbled in his waistcoat pocket and drew out a small and shining\r\nobject, and laid it on the table. It glowed there beneath the lamp with\r\nthe radiant glory of rare old gold; and the image and the letters stood\r\nout in high relief, clear and sharp, as if it had but left the mint a\r\nmonth before. The two men bent over it, and Phillipps took it up and\r\nexamined it closely.\r\n\r\n"Imp. Tiberius Caesar Augustus," he read the legend, and then, looking at\r\nthe reverse of the coin, he stared in amazement, and at last turned to\r\nDyson with a look of exultation.\r\n\r\n"Do you know what you have found?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Apparently a gold coin of some antiquity," said Dyson, coolly.\r\n\r\n"Quite so, a gold Tiberius. No, that is wrong. You have found _the_ gold\r\nTiberius. Look at the reverse."\r\n\r\nDyson looked and saw the coin was stamped with the figure of a faun\r\nstanding amidst reeds and flowing water. The features, minute as they\r\nwere, stood out in delicate outline; it was a face lovely and yet\r\nterrible, and Dyson thought of the well-known passage of the lad\'s\r\nplaymate, gradually growing with his growth and increasing with his\r\nstature, till the air was filled with the rank fume of the goat.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, "it is a curious coin. Do you know it?"\r\n\r\n"I know about it. It is one of the comparatively few historical objects\r\nin existence; it is all storied like those jewels we have read of. A\r\nwhole cycle of legend has gathered round the thing; the tale goes that\r\nit formed part of an issue struck by Tiberius to commemorate an infamous\r\nexcess. You see the legend on the reverse: \'Victoria.\' It is said that\r\nby an extraordinary accident the whole issue was thrown into the melting\r\npot, and that only this one coin escaped. It glints through history and\r\nlegend, appearing and disappearing, with intervals of a hundred years in\r\ntime and continents in place. It was discovered by an Italian humanist,\r\nand lost and rediscovered. It has not been heard of since 1727, when Sir\r\nJoshua Byrde, a Turkey merchant, brought it home from Aleppo, and\r\nvanished with it a month after he had shown it to the virtuosi, no man\r\nknew or knows where. And here it is!"\r\n\r\n"Put it into your pocket, Dyson," he said, after a pause. "I would not\r\nlet any one have a glimpse of the thing, if I were you. I would not talk\r\nabout it. Did either of the men you saw see you?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I think not. I don\'t think the first man, the man who was vomited\r\nout of the dark passage, saw anything at all; and I am sure that the\r\nsecond could not have seen me."\r\n\r\n"And you didn\'t really see them. You couldn\'t recognize either the one\r\nor the other if you met him in the street to-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t think I could. The street, as I said, was dimly lighted,\r\nand they ran like mad-men."\r\n\r\nThe two men sat silent for some time, each weaving his own fancies of\r\nthe story; but lust of the marvellous was slowly overpowering Dyson\'s\r\nmore sober thoughts.\r\n\r\n"It is all more strange than I fancied," he said at last. "It was queer\r\nenough what I saw; a man is sauntering along a quiet, sober, every-day\r\nLondon street, a street of gray houses and blank walls, and there, for a\r\nmoment, a veil seems drawn aside, and the very fume of the pit steams up\r\nthrough the flagstones, the ground glows, red hot, beneath his feet, and\r\nhe seems to hear the hiss of the infernal caldron. A man flying in mad\r\nterror for his life, and furious hate pressing hot on his steps with\r\nknife drawn ready; here indeed is horror. But what is all that to what\r\nyou have told me? I tell you, Phillipps, I see the plot thicken, our\r\nsteps will henceforth be dogged with mystery, and the most ordinary\r\nincidents will teem with significance. You may stand out against it, and\r\nshut your eyes, but they will be forced open; mark my words, you will\r\nhave to yield to the inevitable. A clue, tangled if you like, has been\r\nplaced by chance in our hands; it will be our business to follow it up.\r\nAs for the guilty person or persons in this strange case, they will be\r\nunable to escape us, our nets will be spread far and wide over this\r\ngreat city, and suddenly, in the streets and places of public resort, we\r\nshall in some way or other be made aware that we are in touch with the\r\nunknown criminal. Indeed, I almost fancy I see him slowly approaching\r\nthis quiet square of yours; he is loitering at street corners,\r\nwandering, apparently without aim, down far-reaching thoroughfares, but\r\nall the while coming nearer and nearer, drawn by an irresistible\r\nmagnetism, as ships were drawn to the Loadstone Rock in the Eastern\r\ntale."\r\n\r\n"I certainly think," replied Phillipps, "that, if you pull out that coin\r\nand flourish it under people\'s noses as you are doing at the present\r\nmoment, you will very probably find yourself in touch with the criminal,\r\nor a criminal. You will undoubtedly be robbed with violence. Otherwise,\r\nI see no reason why either of us should be troubled. No one saw you\r\nsecure the coin, and no one knows you have it. I, for my part, shall\r\nsleep peacefully, and go about my business with a sense of security and\r\na firm dependence on the natural order of things. The events of the\r\nevening, the adventure in the street, have been odd, I grant you, but I\r\nresolutely decline to have any more to do with the matter, and, if\r\nnecessary, I shall consult the police. I will not be enslaved by a gold\r\nTiberius, even though it swims into my ken in a manner which is somewhat\r\nmelodramatic."\r\n\r\n"And I for my part," said Dyson, "go forth like a knight-errant in\r\nsearch of adventure. Not that I shall need to seek; rather adventure\r\nwill seek me; I shall be like a spider in the midst of his web,\r\nresponsive to every movement, and ever on the alert."\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards Dyson took his leave, and Mr. Phillipps spent the\r\nrest of the night in examining some flint arrow-heads which he had\r\npurchased. He had every reason to believe that they were the work of a\r\nmodern and not a palaeolithic man, still he was far from gratified when a\r\nclose scrutiny showed him that his suspicions were well founded. In his\r\nanger at the turpitude which would impose on an ethnologist, he\r\ncompletely forgot Dyson and the gold Tiberius; and when he went to bed\r\nat first sunlight, the whole tale had faded utterly from his thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENCOUNTER OF THE PAVEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Dyson, walking leisurely along Oxford. Street, and staring with\r\nbland inquiry at whatever caught his attention, enjoyed in all its rare\r\nflavors the sensation that he was really very hard at work. His\r\nobservation of mankind, the traffic, and the shop-windows tickled his\r\nfaculties with an exquisite bouquet; he looked serious, as one looks on\r\nwhom charges of weight and moment are laid, and he was attentive in his\r\nglances to right and left, for fear lest he should miss some\r\ncircumstance of more acute significance. He had narrowly escaped being\r\nrun over at a crossing by a charging van, for he hated to hurry his\r\nsteps, and indeed the afternoon was warm; and he had just halted by a\r\nplace of popular refreshment, when the astounding gestures of a well\r\ndressed individual on the opposite pavement held him enchanted and\r\ngasping like a fish. A treble line of hansoms, carriages, vans, cabs,\r\nand omnibuses, was tearing east and west, and not the most daring\r\nadventurer of the crossings would have cared to try his fortune; but the\r\nperson who had attracted Dyson\'s attention seemed to rage on the very\r\nedge of the pavement, now and then darting forward at the hazard of\r\ninstant death, and at each repulse absolutely dancing with excitement,\r\nto the rich amusement of the passers-by. At last, a gap that would, have\r\ntried the courage of a street-boy appeared between the serried lines of\r\nvehicles, and the man rushed across in a frenzy, and escaping by a\r\nhair\'s breadth pounced upon Dyson as a tiger pounces on her prey. "I saw\r\nyou looking about you," he said, sputtering out his words in his intense\r\neagerness; "would you mind telling me this? Was the man who came out of\r\nthe Aerated Bread Shop and jumped, into the hansom three minutes ago a\r\nyoungish looking man with dark whiskers and spectacles? Can\'t you speak,\r\nman? For Heaven\'s sake can\'t you speak? Answer me; it\'s a matter of life\r\nand death."\r\n\r\nThe words bubbled and boiled out of the man\'s mouth in the fury of his\r\nemotion, his face went from red to white, and the beads of sweat stood\r\nout on his forehead, and he stamped his feet as he spoke and tore with\r\nhis hand at his coat, as if something swelled and choked him, stopping\r\nthe passage of his breath.\r\n\r\n"My dear sir," said Dyson, "I always like to be accurate. Your\r\nobservation was perfectly correct. As you say, a youngish man, a man, I\r\nshould say, of somewhat timid bearing, ran rapidly out of the shop here,\r\nand bounced into a hansom that must have been waiting for him, as it\r\nwent eastwards at once. Your friend also wore spectacles, as you say.\r\nPerhaps you would like me to call a hansom for you to follow the\r\ngentleman?"\r\n\r\n"No, thank you; it would be waste of time." The man gulped down\r\nsomething which appeared to rise in his throat, and Dyson was alarmed to\r\nsee him shaking with hysterical laughter, and he clung hard to a\r\nlamp-post and swayed and staggered like a ship in a heavy gale.\r\n\r\n"How shall I face the doctor?" he murmured to himself. "It is too hard\r\nto fail at the last moment." Then he seemed to recollect himself, and\r\nstood straight again, and looked quietly at Dyson. I owe you an apology\r\nfor my violence, he said at last. "Many men would not be so patient as\r\nyou have been. Would you mind adding to your kindness by walking with me\r\na little way? I feel a little sick; I think it\'s the sun."\r\n\r\nDyson nodded assent, and devoted himself to a quiet scrutiny of this\r\nstrange personage as they moved on together. The man was dressed in\r\nquiet taste, and the most scrupulous observer could find nothing amiss\r\nwith the fashion or make of his clothes, yet, from his hat to his boots,\r\neverything seemed inappropriate. His silk hat, Dyson thought, should\r\nhave been a high bowler of odious pattern worn with a baggy\r\nmorning-coat, and an instinct told him that the fellow did not commonly\r\ncarry a clean pocket-handkerchief. The face was not of the most\r\nagreeable pattern, and was in no way improved by a pair of bulbous\r\nchin-whiskers of a ginger hue, into which mustaches of light color\r\nmerged imperceptibly. Yet in spite of these signals hung out by nature,\r\nDyson felt that the individual beside him was something more than\r\ncompact of vulgarity. He was struggling with himself, holding his\r\nfeelings in check, but now and again passion would mount black to his\r\nface, and it was evidently by a supreme effort that he kept himself\r\nfrom raging like a madman. Dyson found something curious and a little\r\nterrible in the spectacle of an occult emotion thus striving for the\r\nmastery, and threatening to break out at every instant with violence,\r\nand they had gone some distance before the person whom he had met by so\r\nodd a hazard was able to speak quietly.\r\n\r\n"You are really very good," he said. "I apologize again; my rudeness was\r\nreally most unjustifiable. I feel my conduct demands an explanation, and\r\nI shall be happy to give it you. Do you happen to know of any place near\r\nhere where one could sit down? I should really be very glad."\r\n\r\n"My dear sir," said Dyson, solemnly, "the only cafe in London is close\r\nby. Pray do not consider yourself as bound to offer me any explanation,\r\nbut at the same time I should be most happy to listen to you. Let us\r\nturn down here."\r\n\r\nThey walked down a sober street and turned into what seemed a narrow\r\npassage past an iron-barred gate thrown back. The passage was paved with\r\nflagstones, and decorated with handsome shrubs in pots on either side,\r\nand the shadow of the high walls made a coolness which was very\r\nagreeable after the hot breath of the sunny street. Presently the\r\npassage opened out into a tiny square, a charming place, a morsel of\r\nFrance transplanted into the heart of London. High walls rose on either\r\nside, covered with glossy creepers, flower-beds beneath were gay with\r\nnasturtiums, geraniums, and marigolds, and odorous with mignonette, and\r\nin the centre of the square a fountain hidden by greenery sent a cool\r\nshower continually plashing into the basin beneath, and the very noise\r\nmade this retreat delightful. Chairs and tables were disposed at\r\nconvenient intervals, and at the other end of the court broad doors had\r\nbeen thrown back; beyond was a long, dark room, and the turmoil of\r\ntraffic had become a distant murmur. Within the room one or two men were\r\nsitting at the tables, writing and sipping, but the courtyard was empty.\r\n\r\n"You see, we shall be quiet," said Dyson. "Pray sit down here, Mr.--?"\r\n\r\n"Wilkins. My name is Henry Wilkins."\r\n\r\n"Sit here, Mr. Wilkins. I think you will find that a comfortable seat. I\r\nsuppose you have not been here before? This is the quiet time; the place\r\nwill be like a hive at six o\'clock, and the chairs and tables will\r\noverflow into that little alley there."\r\n\r\nA waiter came in response to the bell; and after Dyson had politely\r\ninquired after the health of M. Annibault, the proprietor, he ordered a\r\nbottle of the wine of Champigny.\r\n\r\n"The wine of Champigny," he observed to Mr. Wilkins, who was evidently a\r\ngood deal composed by the influence of the place, "is a Tourainian wine\r\nof great merit. Ah, here it is; let me fill your glass. How do you find\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed," said Mr. Wilkins, "I should have pronounced it a fine\r\nBurgundy. The bouquet is very exquisite. I am fortunate in lighting upon\r\nsuch a good Samaritan as yourself. I wonder you did not think me mad.\r\nBut if you knew the terrors that assailed me, I am sure you would no\r\nlonger be surprised at conduct which was certainly most unjustifiable."\r\n\r\nHe sipped his wine, and leant back in his chair, relishing the drip and\r\ntrickle of the fountain, and the cool greenness that hedged in this\r\nlittle port of refuge.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said at last, "that is indeed an admirable wine. Thank you;\r\nyou will allow me to offer you another bottle?"\r\n\r\nThe waiter was summoned, and descended through a trap-door in the floor\r\nof the dark apartment, and brought up the wine. Mr. Wilkins lit a\r\ncigarette, and Dyson pulled out his pipe.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Mr. Wilkins, "I promised to give you an explanation of my\r\nstrange behavior. It is rather a long story, but I see, sir, that you\r\nare no mere cold observer of the ebb and flow of life. You take, I\r\nthink, a warm and an intelligent interest in the chances of your\r\nfellow-creatures, and I believe you will find what I have to tell not\r\ndevoid of interest."\r\n\r\nMr. Dyson signified his assent to these propositions, and though he\r\nthought Mr. Wilkins\'s diction a little pompous, prepared to interest\r\nhimself in his tale. The other, who had so raged with passion half an\r\nhour before, was now perfectly cool, and when he had smoked out his\r\ncigarette, he began in an even voice to relate the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL OF THE DARK VALLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am the son of a poor but learned clergyman in the West of\r\nEngland,--but I am forgetting, these details are not of special\r\ninterest. I will briefly state, then, that my father, who was, as I\r\nhave said, a learned man, had never learnt the specious arts by which\r\nthe great are flattered, and would never condescend to the despicable\r\npursuit of self-advertisement. Though his fondness for ancient\r\nceremonies and quaint customs, combined with a kindness of heart that\r\nwas unequalled and a primitive and fervent piety, endeared him to his\r\nmoor-land parishioners, such were not the steps by which clergy then\r\nrose in the Church, and at sixty my father was still incumbent of the\r\nlittle benefice he had accepted in his thirtieth year. The income of the\r\nliving was barely sufficient to support life in the decencies which are\r\nexpected of the Anglican parson; and when my father died a few years\r\nago, I, his only child, found myself thrown upon the world with a\r\nslender capital of less than a hundred pounds, and all the problem of\r\nexistence before me. I felt that there was nothing for me to do in the\r\ncountry, and as usually happens in such eases, London drew me like a\r\nmagnet. One day in August, in the early morning, while the dew still\r\nglittered on the turf, and on the high green banks of the lane, a\r\nneighbor drove me to the railway station, and I bade good-bye to the\r\nland of the broad moors and unearthly battlements of the wild tors. It\r\nwas six o\'clock as we neared London; the faint sickly fume of the\r\nbrickfields about Acton came in puffs through the open window, and a\r\nmist was rising from the ground. Presently the brief view of successive\r\nstreets, prim and uniform, struck me with a sense of monotony; the hot\r\nair seemed to grow hotter; and when we had rolled beneath the dismal and\r\nsqualid houses, whose dirty and neglected back yards border the line\r\nnear Paddington, I felt as if I should be stifled in this fainting\r\nbreath of London. I got a hansom and drove off, and every street\r\nincreased my gloom; gray houses with blinds drawn down, whole\r\nthoroughfares almost desolate, and the foot-passengers who seemed to\r\nstagger wearily along rather than walk, all made me feel a sinking at\r\nheart. I put up for the night at a small hotel in a street leading from\r\nthe Strand, where my father had stayed on his few brief visits to town;\r\nand when I went out after dinner, the real gayety and bustle of the\r\nStrand and Fleet Street could cheer me but little, for in all this great\r\ncity there was no single human being whom I could claim even as an\r\nacquaintance. I will not weary you with the history of the next year,\r\nfor the adventures of a man who sinks are too trite to be worth\r\nrecalling. My money did not last me long; I found that I must be neatly\r\ndressed, or no one to whom I applied would so much as listen to me; and\r\nI must live in a street of decent reputation if I wished to be treated\r\nwith common civility. I applied for various posts, for which, as I now\r\nsee, I was completely devoid of qualification; I tried to become a clerk\r\nwithout having the smallest notion of business habits, and I found, to\r\nmy cost, that a general knowledge of literature and an execrable style\r\nof penmanship are far from being looked upon with favor in commercial\r\ncircles. I had read one of the most charming of the works of a famous\r\nnovelist of the present day, and I frequented the Fleet Street taverns\r\nin the hope of making literary friends, and so getting the\r\nintroductions which I understood were indispensable in the career of\r\nletters. I was disappointed; I once or twice ventured to address\r\ngentlemen who were sitting in adjoining boxes, and I was answered,\r\npolitely indeed, but in a manner that told me my advances were unusual.\r\nPound by pound, my small resources melted; I could no longer think of\r\nappearances; I migrated to a shy quarter, and my meals became mere\r\nobservances. I went out at one and returned to my room at two, but\r\nnothing but a milk-cake had occurred in the interval. In short, I became\r\nacquainted with misfortune; and as I sat amidst slush and ice on a seat\r\nin Hyde Park, munching a piece of bread, I realized the bitterness of\r\npoverty, and the feelings of a gentleman reduced to something far below\r\nthe condition of a vagrant. In spite of all discouragement I did not\r\ndesist in my efforts to earn a living. I consulted advertisement\r\ncolumns, I kept my eyes open for a chance, I looked in at the windows of\r\nstationers\' shops, but all in vain. One evening I was sitting in a Free\r\nLibrary, and I saw an advertisement in one of the papers. It was\r\nsomething like this: "Wanted, by a gentleman a person of literary taste\r\nand abilities as secretary and amanuensis. Must not object to travel."\r\nOf course I knew that such an advertisement would have answers by the\r\nhundred, and I thought my own chances of securing the post extremely\r\nsmall; however, I applied at the address given, and wrote to Mr. Smith,\r\nwho was staying at a large hotel at the West End. I must confess that my\r\nheart gave a jump when I received a note a couple of days later, asking\r\nme to call at the Cosmopole at my earliest convenience. I do not know,\r\nsir, what your experiences of life may have been, and so I cannot tell\r\nwhether you have known such moments. A slight sickness, my heart beating\r\nrather more rapidly than usual, a choking in the throat, and a\r\ndifficulty of utterance; such were my sensations as I walked to the\r\nCosmopole. I had to mention the name twice before the hall porter could\r\nunderstand me, and as I went upstairs my hands were wet. I was a good\r\ndeal struck by Mr. Smith\'s appearance; he looked younger than I did, and\r\nthere was something mild and hesitating about his expression. He was\r\nreading when I came in, and he looked up when I gave my name. "My dear\r\nsir," he said, "I am really delighted to see you. I have read very\r\ncarefully the letter you were good enough to send me. Am I to understand\r\nthat this document is in your own handwriting?" He showed me the letter\r\nI had written, and I told him I was not so fortunate as to be able to\r\nkeep a secretary myself. "Then, sir," he went on, "the post I advertised\r\nis at your service. You have no objection to travel, I presume?" As you\r\nmay imagine, I closed pretty eagerly with the offer he made, and thus I\r\nentered the service of Mr. Smith. For the first few weeks I had no\r\nspecial duties; I had received a quarter\'s salary, and a handsome\r\nallowance was made me in lieu of board and lodging. One morning,\r\nhowever, when I called at the hotel according to instructions, my master\r\ninformed me that I must hold myself in readiness for a sea-voyage, and,\r\nto spare unnecessary detail, in the course of a fortnight we had landed\r\nat New York. Mr. Smith told me that he was engaged on a work of a\r\nspecial nature, in the compilation of which some peculiar researches had\r\nto be made; in short, I was given to understand that we were to travel\r\nto the far West.\r\n\r\nAfter about a week had been spent in New York we took our seats in the\r\ncars, and began a journey tedious beyond all conception. Day after day,\r\nand night after night, the great train rolled on, threading its way\r\nthrough cities the very names of which were strange to me, passing at\r\nslow speed over perilous viaducts, skirting mountain ranges and pine\r\nforests, and plunging into dense tracts of wood, where mile after mile\r\nand hour after hour the same monotonous growth of brushwood met the eye,\r\nand all along the continual clatter and rattle of the wheels upon the\r\nill-laid lines made it difficult to hear the voices of our\r\nfellow-passengers. We were a heterogeneous and ever-changing company;\r\noften I woke up in the dead of night with the sudden grinding jar of the\r\nbrakes, and looking out found that we had stopped in the shabby street\r\nof some frame-built town, lighted chiefly by the flaring windows of the\r\nsaloon. A few rough-looking fellows would often come out to stare at the\r\ncars, and sometimes passengers got down, and sometimes there was a party\r\nof two or three waiting on the wooden sidewalk to get on board. Many of\r\nthe passengers were English; humble households torn up from the moorings\r\nof a thousand years, and bound for some problematical paradise in the\r\nalkali desert or the Rockies. I heard the men talking to one another of\r\nthe great profits to be made on the virgin soil of America, and two or\r\nthree, who were mechanics, expatiated on the wonderful wages given to\r\nskilled labor on the railways and in the factories of the States. This\r\ntalk usually fell dead after a few minutes, and I could see a sickness\r\nand dismay in the faces of these men as they looked at the ugly brush or\r\nat the desolate expanse of the prairie, dotted here and there with\r\nframe-houses, devoid of garden, or flowers or trees, standing all alone\r\nin what might have been a great gray sea frozen into stillness. Day\r\nafter day the waving sky line, and the desolation of a land without form\r\nor color or variety, appalled the hearts of such of us as were\r\nEnglishmen, and once in the night as I lay awake I heard a woman weeping\r\nand sobbing, and asking what she had done to come to such a place. Her\r\nhusband tried to comfort her in the broad speech of Gloucestershire,\r\ntelling her the ground was so rich that one had only to plough it up and\r\nit would grow sunflowers of itself, but she cried for her mother and\r\ntheir old cottage and the beehives, like a little child. The sadness of\r\nit all overwhelmed me, and I had no heart to think of other matters; the\r\nquestion of what Mr. Smith could have to do in such a country, and of\r\nwhat manner of literary research could be carried on in the wilderness,\r\nhardly troubled me. Now and again my situation struck me as peculiar; I\r\nhad been engaged as a literary assistant at a handsome salary, and yet\r\nmy master was still almost a stranger to me; sometimes he would come to\r\nwhere I was sitting in the cars and make a few banal remarks about the\r\ncountry, but for the most part of the journey he sat by himself, not\r\nspeaking to any one, and so far as I could judge, deep in his thoughts.\r\nIt was I think on the fifth day from New York when I received, the\r\nintimation that we should shortly leave the cars; I had been watching\r\nsome distant mountains which rose wild and savage before us, and I was\r\nwondering if there were human beings so unhappy as to speak of home in\r\nconnection with those piles of lumbered rock, when Mr. Smith touched me\r\nlightly on the shoulder. "You will be glad to be done with, the cars, I\r\nhave no doubt, Mr. Wilkins," he said. "You were looking at the\r\nmountains, I think? Well, I hope we shall be there to-night. The train\r\nstops at Reading, and I dare say we shall manage to find our way."\r\n\r\nA few hours later the brakeman brought the tram to a standstill at the\r\nReading depot and we got out. I noticed that the town, though of course\r\nbuilt almost entirely of frame-houses, was larger and busier than any we\r\nhad passed for the last two days. The depot was crowded, and as the bell\r\nand whistle sounded, I saw that a number of persons were preparing to\r\nleave the cars, while an even greater number were waiting to get on\r\nboard. Besides the passengers, there was a pretty dense crowd of people,\r\nsome of whom had come to meet or to see off their friends and relatives,\r\nwhile others were mere loafers. Several of our English fellow passengers\r\ngot down at Reading, but the confusion was so great that they were lost\r\nto my sight almost immediately. Mr. Smith beckoned to me to follow him,\r\nand we were soon in the thick of the mass; and the continual ringing of\r\nbells, the hubbub of voices, the shrieking of whistles, and the hiss of\r\nescaping steam, confused my senses, and I wondered dimly as I struggled\r\nafter my employer, where we were going, and how we should be able to\r\nfind our way through an unknown country. Mr. Smith had put on a\r\nwide-brimmed hat, which he had sloped over his eyes, and as all the men\r\nwore hats of the same pattern, it was with some difficulty that I\r\ndistinguished him in the crowd. We got free at last, and he struck down\r\na side street, and made one or two sharp turns to right and left. It was\r\ngetting dusk, and we seemed to be passing through a shy portion of the\r\ntown, there were few people about in the ill-lighted streets, and these\r\nfew were men of the most unprepossessing pattern. Suddenly we stopped\r\nbefore a corner house, a man was standing at the door, apparently on the\r\nlook-out for some one, and I noticed that he and Smith gave sharp\r\nglances one to the other.\r\n\r\n"From New York City, I expect, mister?"\r\n\r\n"From New York!"\r\n\r\n"All right; they \'re ready, and you can have \'em when you choose. I know\r\nmy orders, you see, and I mean to run this business through."\r\n\r\n"Very well, Mr. Evans, that is what we want. Our money is good, you\r\nknow. Bring them round."\r\n\r\nI had stood silent, listening to this dialogue, and wondering what it\r\nmeant. Smith began to walk impatiently up and down the street, and the\r\nman Evans was still standing at his door. He had given a sharp whistle,\r\nand I saw him looking me over in a quiet leisurely way, as if to make\r\nsure of my face for another time. I was thinking what all this could\r\nmean, when an ugly, slouching lad came up a side passage, leading two\r\nraw-boned horses.\r\n\r\n"Get up, Mr. Wilkins, and be quick about it," said Smith. "We ought to\r\nbe on our way."\r\n\r\nWe rode off together into the gathering darkness, and before long I\r\nlooked back and saw the far plain behind us, with the lights of the town\r\nglimmering faintly; and in front rose the mountains. Smith guided his\r\nhorse on the rough track as surely as if he had been riding along\r\nPiccadilly, and I followed him as well as I could. I was weary and\r\nexhausted, and scarcely took note of anything; I felt that the track was\r\na gradual ascent, and here and there I saw great boulders by the road.\r\nThe ride made but little impression on me; I have a faint recollection\r\nof passing through a dense black pine forest, where our horses had to\r\npick their way among the rocks, and I remember the peculiar effect of\r\nthe rarefied air as we kept still mounting higher and higher. I think I\r\nmust have been half asleep for the latter half of the ride, and it was\r\nwith a shock that I heard Smith saying--\r\n\r\n"Here we are, Wilkins. This is Blue-Rock Park. You will enjoy the view\r\nto-morrow. To-night we will have something to eat, and then go to bed."\r\n\r\nA man came out of a rough-looking house and took the horses, and we\r\nfound some fried steak and coarse whiskey awaiting us inside. I had come\r\nto a strange place. There were three rooms,--the room in which we had\r\nsupper, Smith\'s room and my own. The deaf old man who did the work slept\r\nin a sort of shed, and when I woke up the next morning and walked out I\r\nfound that the house stood in a sort of hollow amongst the mountains;\r\nthe clumps of pines and some enormous bluish-gray rocks that stood here\r\nand there between the trees had given the place the name of Blue-Rock\r\nPark. On every side the snow-covered mountains surrounded us, the breath\r\nof the air was as wine, and when I climbed the slope and looked down, I\r\ncould see that, so far as any human fellowship was concerned I might as\r\nwell have been wrecked on some small island in mid-Pacific. The only\r\ntrace of man I could see was the rough log-house where I had slept, and\r\nin my ignorance I did not know that there were similar houses within\r\ncomparatively easy distance, as distance is reckoned in the Rockies. But\r\nat the moment, the utter, dreadful loneliness rushed upon me, and the\r\nthought of the great plain and the great sea that parted me from the\r\nworld I knew, caught me by the throat, and I wondered if I should die\r\nthere in that mountain hollow. It was a terrible instant, and I have not\r\nyet forgotten it. Of course I managed to conquer my horror; I said I\r\nshould be all the stronger for the experience, and I made up my mind to\r\nmake the best of everything. It was a rough life enough, and rough\r\nenough board and lodging. I was left entirely to myself. Smith I\r\nscarcely ever saw, nor did I know when he was in the house. I have often\r\nthought he was far away, and have been surprised to see him walking out\r\nof his room, locking the door behind him and putting the key in his\r\npocket; and on several occasions when I fancied he was busy in his room,\r\nI have seen him come in with his boots covered with dust and dirt. So\r\nfar as work went I enjoyed a complete sinecure; I had nothing to do but\r\nto walk about the valley, to eat, and to sleep. With one thing and\r\nanother I grew accustomed, to the life, and managed to make myself\r\npretty comfortable, and by degrees I began to venture farther away from\r\nthe house, and to explore the country. One day I had contrived to get\r\ninto a neighboring valley, and suddenly I came upon a group of men\r\nsawing timber. I went up to them, hoping that perhaps some of them might\r\nbe Englishmen; at all events they were human beings, and I should hear\r\narticulate speech, for the old man I have mentioned, besides being half\r\nblind and stone deaf, was wholly dumb so far as I was concerned. I was\r\nprepared to be welcomed in a rough and ready fashion, without much, of\r\nthe forms of politeness, but the grim glances and the short gruff\r\nanswers I received astonished me. I saw the men glancing oddly at each\r\nother, and one of them who had stopped work began fingering a gun, and I\r\nwas obliged to return on my path uttering curses on the fate which had\r\nbrought me into a land where men were more brutish than the very brutes.\r\nThe solitude of the life began to oppress me as with a nightmare, and a\r\nfew days later I determined to walk to a kind of station some miles\r\ndistant, where a rough inn was kept for the accommodation of hunters and\r\ntourists. English gentlemen occasionally stopped there for the night,\r\nand I thought I might perhaps fall in with some one of better manners\r\nthan the inhabitants of the country. I found as I had expected a group\r\nof men lounging about the door of the log-house that served as a hotel,\r\nand as I came nearer I could see that heads were put together and looks\r\ninterchanged, and when I walked up the six or seven trappers stared at\r\nme in stony ferocity, and with something of the disgust that one eyes a\r\nloathsome and venomous snake. I felt that I could bear it no longer, and\r\nI called out:--\r\n\r\n"Is there such a thing as an Englishman here, or any one with a little\r\ncivilization?"\r\n\r\nOne of the men put his hand to his belt, but his neighbor checked him\r\nand answered me.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find we\'ve got some of the resources of civilization before very\r\nlong, mister, and I expect you\'ll not fancy them extremely. But anyway,\r\nthere\'s an Englishman tarrying here, and I\'ve no doubt he\'ll be glad to\r\nsee you. There you are, that\'s Mr. D\'Aubernoun."\r\n\r\nA young man, dressed like an English country squire, came and stood at\r\nthe door, and looked at me. One of the men pointed to me and said:--\r\n\r\n"That\'s the individual we were talking about last night. Thought you\r\nmight like to have a look at him, squire, and here he is."\r\n\r\nThe young fellow\'s good-natured English face clouded over, and he\r\nglanced sternly at me, and turned away with a gesture of contempt and\r\naversion.\r\n\r\n"Sir," I cried, "I do not know what I have done to be treated in this\r\nmanner. You are my fellow-countryman, and I expected some courtesy."\r\n\r\nHe gave me a black look and made as if he would go in, but he changed\r\nhis mind, and faced me.\r\n\r\n"You are rather imprudent, I think, to behave in this manner. You must\r\nbe counting on a forbearance which cannot last very long; which may last\r\na very short time, indeed. And let me tell you this, sir, you may call\r\nyourself an Englishman and drag the name of England through the dirt,\r\nbut you need not count on any English influence to help you. If I were\r\nyou, I would not stay here much longer."\r\n\r\nHe went into the inn, and the men quietly watched my face, as I stood\r\nthere, wondering whether I was going mad. The woman of the house came\r\nout and stared at me as if I were a wild beast or a savage, and I turned\r\nto her, and spoke quietly.\r\n\r\n"I am very hungry and thirsty, I have walked a long way. I have plenty\r\nof money. Will you give me something to eat and drink?"\r\n\r\n"No, I won\'t," she said. "You had better quit this."\r\n\r\nI crawled home like a wounded beast, and lay down on my bed. It was all\r\na hopeless puzzle to me. I knew nothing but rage and shame and terror,\r\nand I suffered little more when I passed by a house in an adjacent\r\nvalley, and some children who were playing outside ran from me\r\nshrieking. I was forced to walk to find some occupation. I should have\r\ndied if I had sat down quietly in Blue Rock Park and looked all day at\r\nthe mountains; but wherever I saw a human being I saw the same glance of\r\nhatred and aversion, and once as I was crossing a thick brake I heard a\r\nshot, and the venomous hiss of a bullet close to my ear.\r\n\r\nOne day I heard a conversation which astounded me; I was sitting behind\r\na rock resting, and two men came along the track and halted. One of them\r\nhad got his feet entangled in some wild vines, and swore fiercely, but\r\nthe other laughed, and said they were useful things sometimes.\r\n\r\n"What the hell do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing much. But they \'re uncommon tough, these here vines, and\r\nsometimes rope is skerse and dear."\r\n\r\nThe man who had sworn chuckled at this, and I heard them sit down and\r\nlight their pipes.\r\n\r\n"Have you seen him lately?" asked the humorist.\r\n\r\n"I sighted him the other day, but the darned bullet went high. He\'s got\r\nhis master\'s luck, I expect, sir, but it can\'t last much longer. You\r\nheard about him going to Jinks\'s and trying his brass, but the young\r\nBritisher downed him pretty considerable, I can tell you."\r\n\r\n"What the devil is the meaning of it?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, but I believe it\'ll have to be finished, and done in the\r\nold style, too. You know how they fix the niggers?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, I\'ve seen a little of that. A couple of gallons of\r\nkerosene\'ll cost a dollar at Brown\'s store, but I should say it\'s cheap\r\nanyway."\r\n\r\nThey moved off after this, and I lay still behind the rock, the sweat\r\npouring down my face. I was so sick that I could barely stand, and I\r\nwalked home as slowly as an old man, leaning on my stick. I knew that\r\nthe two men had been talking about me, and I knew that some terrible\r\ndeath was in store for me. That night I could not sleep. I tossed on the\r\nrough bed and tortured myself to find out the meaning of it all. At last\r\nin the very dead of night I rose from the bed, and put on my clothes,\r\nand went out. I did not care where I went, but I felt that I must walk\r\ntill I had tired myself out. It was a clear moonlight night, and in a\r\ncouple of hours I found I was approaching a place of dismal reputation\r\nin the mountains, a deep cleft in the rocks, known as Black Gulf Canyon.\r\nMany years before, an unfortunate party of Englishmen and Englishwomen\r\nhad camped here and had been surrounded by Indians. They were captured,\r\noutraged, and put to death with almost inconceivable tortures, and the\r\nroughest of the trappers or woodsmen gave the canyon a wide berth even in\r\nthe day-time. As I crushed through the dense brushwood which grew above\r\nthe canyon, I heard voices, and wondering who could be in such a place at\r\nsuch a time, I went on, walking more carefully and making as little\r\nnoise as possible. There was a great tree growing on the very edge of\r\nthe rocks, and I lay down and looked out from behind the trunk. Black\r\nGulf Canyon was below me, the moonlight shining bright into its very\r\ndepths from midheaven, and casting shadows as black as death from the\r\npointed rock, and all the sheer rock on the other side, overhanging the\r\ncanyon, was in darkness. At intervals a light veil obscured the\r\nmoonlight, as a filmy cloud fleeted across the moon; and a bitter wind\r\nblew shrill across the gulf. I looked down as I have said, and saw\r\ntwenty men standing in a semicircle round a rock; I counted them one by\r\none, and knew most of them. They were the very vilest of the vile, more\r\nvile than any den in London could show, and there was murder and worse\r\nthan murder on the heads of not a few. Facing them and me stood Mr.\r\nSmith with the rock before him, and on the rock was a great pair of\r\nscales, such, as are used in the stores. I heard his voice ringing down\r\nthe canyon as I lay beside the tree, and my heart turned cold as I heard\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"Life for gold," he cried, "a life for gold. The blood and the life of\r\nan enemy for every pound of gold."\r\n\r\nA man stepped out and raised one hand, and with the other flung a bright\r\nlump of something into the pan of the scales, which clanged down, and\r\nSmith muttered something in his ear. Then he cried again:--\r\n\r\n"Blood for gold; for a pound of gold, the life of an enemy. For every\r\npound of gold upon the scales, a life."\r\n\r\nOne by one the men came forward, each lifting up his right hand; and the\r\ngold was weighed in the scales, and each time Smith leaned forward and\r\nspoke to each man in his ear. Then he cried again:--\r\n\r\n"Desire and lust, for gold on the scales. For every pound of gold,\r\nenjoyment of desire."\r\n\r\nI saw the same thing happen as before; the uplifted hand, and the metal\r\nweighed, and the mouth whispering, and black passion on every face.\r\n\r\nThen, one by one, I saw the men again step up to Smith. A muttered\r\nconversation seemed to take place; I could see that Smith was explaining\r\nand directing, and I noticed that he gesticulated a little as one who\r\npoints out the way, and once or twice he moved his hands quickly as if\r\nhe would show that the path was clear and could not be missed. I kept my\r\neyes so intently on his figure that I noted little else, and at last it\r\nwas with a start that I realized that the canyon was empty. A moment\r\nbefore I thought I had seen the group of villainous faces, and the two\r\nstanding, a little apart by the rock; I had looked down a moment, and\r\nwhen I glanced again into the canyon there was no one there. In dumb\r\nterror I made my way home, and I fell asleep in an instant from\r\nexhaustion. No doubt I should have slept on for many hours, but when I\r\nwoke up, the sun was only rising, and the light shone in on my bed. I\r\nhad started up from sleep with the sensation of having received a\r\nviolent shock, and as I looked in confusion about me I saw to my\r\namazement that there were three men in the room. One of them had his\r\nhand on my shoulder and spoke to me.\r\n\r\n"Come, mister, wake up. Your time\'s up now, I reckon, and the boys are\r\nwaiting for you outside, and they \'re in a big hurry. Come on; you can\r\nput on your clothes, it\'s kind of chilly this morning."\r\n\r\nI saw the other two men smiling sourly at each other, but I understood\r\nnothing. I simply pulled on my clothes, and said I was ready.\r\n\r\n"All right, come on then. You go first, Nichols, and Jim and I will give\r\nthe gentleman an arm."\r\n\r\nThey took me out into the sunlight, and then I understood the meaning of\r\na dull murmur that had vaguely perplexed me while I was dressing. There\r\nwere about two hundred men waiting outside, and some women too, and when\r\nthey saw me there was a low muttering growl. I did not know what I had\r\ndone, but that noise made my heart beat and the sweat come out on my\r\nface. I saw confusedly, as through a veil, the tumult and tossing of the\r\ncrowd, discordant voices were speaking, and amongst all those faces\r\nthere was not one glance of mercy, but a fury of lust that I did not\r\nunderstand. I found myself presently walking in a sort of procession up\r\nthe slope of the valley, and on every side of me there were men with\r\nrevolvers in their hands. Now and then a voice struck me, and I heard\r\nwords and sentences of which I could form no connected story. But I\r\nunderstood that there was one sentence of execration; I heard scraps of\r\nstories that seemed strange and improbable. Some one was talking of men,\r\nlured by cunning devices from their homes and murdered with hideous\r\ntortures, found writhing like wounded snakes in dark and lonely places,\r\nonly crying for some one to stab them to the heart, and so end their\r\ntorments; and I heard another voice speaking of innocent girls who had\r\nvanished for a day or two, and then had come back and died, blushing red\r\nwith shame even in the agonies of death. I wondered what it all meant,\r\nand what was to happen, but I was so weary that I walked on in a dream,\r\nscarcely longing for anything but sleep. At last we stopped. We had\r\nreached the summit of the hill, overlooking Blue Rock Valley, and I saw\r\nthat I was standing beneath a clump of trees where I had often sat. I\r\nwas in the midst of a ring of armed men, and I saw that two or three men\r\nwere very busy with piles of wood, while others were fingering a rope.\r\nThen there was a stir in the crowd, and a man was pushed forward. His\r\nhands and feet were tightly bound with cord, and though his face was\r\nunutterably villainous I pitied him for the agony that worked his\r\nfeatures and twisted his lips. I knew him; he was amongst those that had\r\ngathered round Smith in Black Gulf Canyon. In an instant he was unbound,\r\nand stripped naked; and borne beneath one of the trees, and his neck\r\nencircled by a noose that went around the trunk. A hoarse voice gave\r\nsome kind of order; there was a rush of feet, and the rope tightened;\r\nand there before me I saw the blackened face and the writhing limbs and\r\nthe shameful agony of death. One after another, half a dozen men, all of\r\nwhom I had seen in the canyon the night before, were strangled before me,\r\nand their bodies were flung forth on the ground. Then there was a pause,\r\nand the man who had roused me a short while before, came up to me and\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n"Now, mister, it\'s your turn. We give you five minutes to cast up your\r\naccounts, and when that\'s clocked, by the living God we will burn you\r\nalive at that tree."\r\n\r\nIt was then I awoke and understood. I cried out:--\r\n\r\n"Why, what have I done? Why should you hurt me? I am a harmless man, I\r\nnever did you any wrong." I covered my face with my hands; it seemed so\r\npitiful, and it was such a terrible death.\r\n\r\n"What have I done?" I cried again. "You must take me for some other man.\r\nYou cannot know me."\r\n\r\n"You black-hearted devil," said the man at my side, "we know you well\r\nenough. There\'s not a man within thirty miles of this that won\'t curse\r\nJack Smith when you are burning in hell."\r\n\r\n"My name is not Smith," I said, with some hope left in me. "My name is\r\nWilkins. I was Mr. Smith\'s secretary, but I knew nothing of him."\r\n\r\n"Hark at the black liar," said the man. "Secretary be damned! You were\r\nclever enough, I dare say, to slink out at night, and keep your face in\r\nthe dark, but we\'ve tracked you out at last. But your time\'s up. Come\r\nalong."\r\n\r\nI was dragged to the tree and bound to it with chains, and I saw the\r\npiles of wood heaped all about me, and shut my eyes. Then I felt myself\r\ndrenched all over with some liquid, and looked again, and a woman\r\ngrinned at me. She had just emptied a great can of petroleum over me and\r\nover the wood. A voice shouted, "Fire away," and I fainted and knew\r\nnothing more.\r\n\r\nWhen I opened my eyes I was lying on a bed in a bare comfortless room. A\r\ndoctor was holding some strong salts to my nostrils, and a gentleman\r\nstanding by the bed, whom I afterwards found to be the sheriff,\r\naddressed me:--\r\n\r\n"Say, mister," he began, "you\'ve had an uncommon narrow squeak for it.\r\nThe boys were just about lighting up when I came along with the posse,\r\nand I had as much as I could do to bring you off, I can tell you. And,\r\nmind you, I don\'t blame, them; they had made up their minds, you see,\r\nthat you were the head of the Black Gulf gang, and at first nothing I\r\ncould say would persuade them you weren\'t Jack Smith. Luckily, a man\r\nfrom here named Evans, that came along with us, allowed he had seen you\r\nwith Jack Smith, and that you were yourself. So we brought you along and\r\njailed you, but you can go if you like, when you\'re through with this\r\nfaint turn."\r\n\r\nI got on the cars the next day, and in three weeks I was in London;\r\nagain almost penniless. But from that time my fortune seemed to change.\r\nI made influential friends in all directions; bank directors courted my\r\ncompany, and editors positively flung themselves into my arms. I had\r\nonly to choose my career, and after a while I determined that I was\r\nmeant by nature for a life of comparative leisure. With an ease that\r\nseemed almost ridiculous I obtained a well-paid position in connection\r\nwith a prosperous political club. I have charming chambers in a central\r\nneighborhood close to the parks; the club _chef_ exerts himself when I\r\nlunch or dine, and the rarest vintages in the cellar are always at my\r\ndisposal. Yet, since my return to London, I have never known a day\'s\r\nsecurity or peace; I tremble when I awake lest Smith should be standing\r\nat my bed, and every step I take seems to bring me nearer to the edge of\r\nthe precipice. Smith, I knew, had escaped free from the raid of the\r\nvigilantes, and I grew faint at the thought that he would in all\r\nprobability return to London, and that suddenly and unprepared I should\r\nmeet him face to face. Every morning as I left my house, I would peer up\r\nand down the street, expecting to see that dreaded figure awaiting me; I\r\nhave delayed at street corners, my heart in my mouth, sickening at the\r\nthought that a few quick steps might bring us together; I could not bear\r\nto frequent the theatres or music halls, lest by some bizarre chance he\r\nshould prove to be my neighbor. Sometimes, I have been forced, against\r\nmy will, to walk out at night, and then in silent squares the shadows\r\nhave made me shudder, and in the medley of meetings in the crowded\r\nthoroughfares, I have said to myself, "It must come sooner or later; he\r\nwill surely return to town, and I shall see him when I feel most\r\nsecure." I scanned the newspapers for hint or intimation of approaching\r\ndanger, and no small type nor report of trivial interest was allowed to\r\npass unread. Especially I read and re-read the advertisement columns,\r\nbut without result. Months passed by and I was undisturbed till, though\r\nI felt far from safe, I no longer suffered from the intolerable\r\noppression of instant and ever present terror. This afternoon as I was\r\nwalking quietly along Oxford Street, I raised my eyes, and looked across\r\nthe road, and then at last I saw the man who had so long haunted my\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Wilkins finished his wine, and leaned back in his chair, looking\r\nsadly at Dyson; and then, as if a thought struck him, fished out of an\r\ninner pocket a leather letter case, and handed a newspaper cutting\r\nacross the table.\r\n\r\nDyson glanced closely at the slip, and saw that it had been extracted\r\nfrom the columns of an evening paper. It ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n               WHOLESALE LYNCHING.\r\n\r\n                 SHOCKING STORY.\r\n\r\nA Dalziel telegram from Reading (Colorado) states that advices received\r\nthere from Blue Rock Park report a frightful instance of popular\r\nvengeance. For some time the neighborhood has been terrorized by the\r\ncrimes of a gang of desperadoes, who, under the cover of a carefully\r\nplanned organization, have perpetrated the most infamous cruelties on\r\nmen and women. A Vigilance Committee was formed, and it was found that\r\nthe leader of the gang was a person named Smith, living in Blue Rock\r\nPark. Action was taken, and six of the worst in the band were summarily\r\nstrangled in the presence of two or three hundred men and women. Smith\r\nis said to have escaped.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"This is a terrible story," said Dyson; "I can well believe that your\r\ndays and nights are haunted by such fearful scenes as you have\r\ndescribed. But surely you have no need to fear Smith? He has much, more\r\ncause to fear you. Consider, you have only to lay your information\r\nbefore the police, and a warrant would be immediately issued for his\r\narrest. Besides, you will, I am sure, excuse me for what I am going to\r\nsay."\r\n\r\n"My dear sir," said Mr. Wilkins, "I hope you will speak to me with\r\nperfect freedom."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I must confess that my impression was that you were rather\r\ndisappointed at not being able to stop the man before he drove off. I\r\nthought you seemed annoyed that you could not get across the street."\r\n\r\n"Sir, I did not know what I was about. I caught sight of the man, but it\r\nwas only for a moment, and the agony you witnessed was the agony of\r\nsuspense. I was not perfectly certain of the face; and the horrible\r\nthought that Smith was again in London overwhelmed me. I shuddered at\r\nthe idea of this incarnate fiend, whose soul is black with shocking\r\ncrimes, mingling free and unobserved amongst the harmless crowds,\r\nmeditating perhaps a new and more fearful cycle of infamies. I tell\r\nyou, sir, that an awful being stalks through the streets, a being before\r\nwhom the sunlight itself should blacken, and the summer air grow chill\r\nand dank. Such thoughts as these rushed upon me with the force of a\r\nwhirlwind; I lost my senses."\r\n\r\n"I see. I partly understand your feelings, but I would impress on you\r\nthat you have nothing really to fear. Depend upon it, Smith will not\r\nmolest you in any way. You must remember he himself has had a warning;\r\nand indeed from the brief glance I had of him, he seemed to me to be a\r\nfrightened-looking man. However, I see it is getting late, and if you\r\nwill excuse me, Mr. Wilkins, I think I will be going. I dare say we\r\nshall often meet here."\r\n\r\nDyson walked off smartly, pondering the strange story chance had brought\r\nhim, and finding on cool reflection that there was something a little\r\nstrange in Mr. Wilkins\'s manner, for which not even so weird a catalogue\r\nof experiences could altogether account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVENTURE OF THE MISSING BROTHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Phillipps was, as has been hinted, a gentleman of pronounced\r\nscientific tastes. In his early days he had devoted himself with fond\r\nenthusiasm to the agreeable study of biology, and a brief monograph on\r\nthe Embryology of the Microscopic Holothuria had formed his first\r\ncontribution to the belles lettres. Later, he had somewhat relaxed the\r\nseverity of his pursuits, and had dabbled in the more frivolous subjects\r\nof palaeontology and ethnology; he had a cabinet in his sitting-room\r\nwhose drawers were stuffed with rude flint implements, and a charming\r\nfetish from the South Seas was the dominant note in the decorative\r\nscheme of the apartment. Flattering himself with the title of\r\nmaterialist, he was in truth one of the most credulous of men, but he\r\nrequired a marvel to be neatly draped in the robes of science before he\r\nwould give it any credit, and the wildest dreams took solid shape to him\r\nif only the nomenclature were severe and irreproachable; he laughed at\r\nthe witch, but quailed before the powers of the hypnotist, lifting his\r\neyebrows when Christianity was mentioned, but adoring protyle and the\r\nether. For the rest, he prided himself on a boundless scepticism; the\r\naverage tale of wonder he heard with nothing but contempt, and he would\r\ncertainly not have credited a word or syllable of Dyson\'s story of the\r\npursuer and pursued unless the gold coin had been produced as visible\r\nand tangible evidence. As it was he half suspected that Dyson had\r\nimposed on him; he knew his friend\'s disordered fancies, and his habit\r\nof conjuring up the marvellous to account for the entirely commonplace;\r\nand on the whole he was inclined to think that the so-called facts in\r\nthe odd adventure had been gravely distorted in the telling. Since the\r\nevening on which he had listened to the tale, he had paid Dyson a visit,\r\nand had delivered himself of some serious talk on the necessity of\r\naccurate observation, and the folly, as he put it, of using a\r\nkaleidoscope instead of a telescope in the view of things, to which\r\nremarks his friend had listened with a smile that was extremely sardonic\r\n"My dear fellow," Dyson had remarked at last, "you will allow me to tell\r\nyou that I see your drift perfectly. However, you will be astonished to\r\nhear that I consider you to be the visionary, while I am a sober and\r\nserious spectator of human life. You have gone round the circle, and\r\nwhile you fancy yourself far in the golden land of new philosophies, you\r\nare in reality a dweller in a metaphorical Clapham; your scepticism has\r\ndefeated itself and become a monstrous credulity; you are in fact in the\r\nposition of the bat or owl, I forget which it was, who denied the\r\nexistence of the sun at noonday, and I shall be astonished if you do not\r\none day come to me full of contrition for your manifold intellectual\r\nerrors, with a humble resolution to see things in their true light for\r\nthe future." This tirade had left Mr. Phillipps unimpressed; he\r\nconsidered Dyson as hopeless, and he went home to gloat over some\r\nprimitive stone implements that a friend had sent him from India. He\r\nfound that his landlady, seeing them displayed in all their rude\r\nformlessness upon the table, had removed the collection to the dustbin,\r\nand had replaced it by lunch; and the afternoon was spent in malodorous\r\nresearch. Mrs. Brown, hearing these stones spoken of as very valuable\r\nknives, had called him in his hearing "poor Mr. Phillipps," and between\r\nrage and evil odors he spent a sorry afternoon. It was four o\'clock\r\nbefore he had completed his work of rescue; and, overpowered with the\r\nflavors of decaying cabbage-leaves, Phillipps felt that he must have a\r\nwalk to gain an appetite for the evening meal. Unlike Dyson, he walked\r\nfast, with his eyes on the pavement, absorbed in his thoughts and\r\noblivious of the life around him; and he could not have told by what\r\nstreets he had passed, when he suddenly lifted up his eyes and found\r\nhimself in Leicester Square. The grass and flowers pleased him, and he\r\nwelcomed the opportunity of resting for a few minutes, and glancing\r\nround, he saw a bench which had only one occupant, a lady, and as she\r\nwas seated at one end, Phillipps took up a position at the other\r\nextremity, and began to pass in angry review the events of the\r\nafternoon. He had noticed as he came up to the bench that the person\r\nalready there was neatly dressed, and to all appearance young; her face\r\nhe could not see, as it was turned away in apparent contemplation of the\r\nshrubs, and moreover shielded with her hand; but it would be doing\r\nwrong to Mr. Phillipps to imagine that his choice of a seat was dictated\r\nby any hopes of an affair of the heart; he had simply preferred the\r\ncompany of one lady to that of five dirty children, and having seated\r\nhimself was immersed directly in thoughts of his misfortunes. He had\r\nmeditated changing his lodgings; but now, on a judicial review of the\r\ncase in all its bearings, his calmer judgment told him that the race of\r\nlandladies is like to the race of the leaves, and that there was but\r\nlittle to choose between them. He resolved, however, to talk to Mrs.\r\nBrown, the offender, very coolly and yet severely, to point out the\r\nextreme indiscretion of her conduct, and to express a hope for better\r\nthings in the future. With this decision registered in his mind,\r\nPhillipps was about to get up from the seat and move off, when he was\r\nintensely annoyed to hear a stifled sob, evidently from the lady, who\r\nstill continued her contemplation of the shrubs and flower-beds. He\r\nclutched his stick desperately, and in a moment would have been in full\r\nretreat, when the lady turned her face towards him, and with a mute\r\nentreaty bespoke his attention. She was a young girl with a quaint and\r\npiquant rather than a beautiful face, and she was evidently in the\r\nbitterest distress, and Mr. Phillipps sat down again, and cursed his\r\nchances heartily. The young lady looked at him with a pair of charming\r\neyes of a shining hazel, which showed no trace of tears, though a\r\nhandkerchief was in her hand; she bit her lip, and seemed to struggle\r\nwith some overpowering grief, and her whole attitude was all beseeching\r\nand imploring. Phillipps sat on the edge of the bench gazing awkwardly\r\nat her, and wondering what was to come next, and she looked at him still\r\nwithout speaking.\r\n\r\n"Well, madam," he said at last, "I understood from your gesture that you\r\nwished to speak to me. Is there anything I can do for you? Though, if\r\nyou will pardon me, I cannot help saying that that seems highly\r\nimprobable."\r\n\r\n"Ah, sir," she said in a low murmuring voice, "do not speak harshly to\r\nme. I am in sore straits, and I thought from your face that I could\r\nsafely ask your sympathy, if not your help."\r\n\r\n"Would you kindly tell me what is the matter?" said Phillipps. "Perhaps\r\nyou would like some tea?"\r\n\r\n"I knew I could not be mistaken," the lady replied. "That offer of\r\nrefreshment bespeaks a generous mind. But tea, alas! is powerless to\r\nconsole me. If you will let me, I will endeavor to explain my trouble."\r\n\r\n"I should be glad if you would."\r\n\r\n"I will do so, and I will try and be brief, in spite of the numerous\r\ncomplications which have made me, young as I am, tremble before what\r\nseems the profound and terrible mystery of existence. Yet the grief\r\nwhich now racks my very soul is but too simple; I have lost my brother."\r\n\r\n"Lost your brother! How on earth can that be?"\r\n\r\n"I see I must trouble you with a few particulars. My brother, then, who\r\nis by some years my elder, is a tutor in a private school in the extreme\r\nnorth of London. The want of means deprived him of the advantages of a\r\nUniversity education; and lacking the stamp of a degree, he could not\r\nhope for that position which his scholarship and his talents entitled\r\nhim to claim. He was thus forced to accept the post of classical master\r\nat Dr. Saunderson\'s Highgate Academy for the sons of gentlemen, and he\r\nhas performed his duties with perfect satisfaction to his principal for\r\nsome years. My personal history need not trouble you; if will be enough\r\nif I tell you that for the last month I have been governess in a family\r\nresiding at Tooting. My brother and I have always cherished the warmest\r\nmutual affection; and though circumstances into which I need not enter\r\nhave kept us apart for some time, yet we have never lost sight of one\r\nanother. We made up our minds that unless one of us was absolutely\r\nunable to rise from a bed of sickness, we would never let a week pass by\r\nwithout meeting, and some time ago we chose this square as our\r\nrendezvous on account of its central position and its convenience of\r\naccess. And indeed, after a week of distasteful toil, my brother felt\r\nlittle inclination for much walking, and we have often spent two or\r\nthree hours on this bench, speaking of our prospects and of happier\r\ndays, when we were children. In the early spring it was cold and chilly;\r\nstill we enjoyed the short respite, and I think that we were often taken\r\nfor a pair of lovers, as we sat close together, eagerly talking.\r\nSaturday after Saturday we have met each other here, and though the\r\ndoctor told him it was madness, my brother would not allow the influenza\r\nto break the appointment. That was some time ago; last Saturday we had\r\na long and happy afternoon, and separated more cheerfully than usual,\r\nfeeling that the coming week would be bearable, and resolving that our\r\nnext meeting should be if possible still more pleasant. I arrived here\r\nat the time agreed upon, four o\'clock, and sat down and watched for my\r\nbrother, expecting every moment to see him advancing towards me from\r\nthat gate at the north side of the square. Five minutes passed by, and\r\nhe had not arrived; I thought he must have missed his train, and the\r\nidea that our interview would be cut short by twenty minutes, or perhaps\r\nhalf an hour, saddened me; I had hoped we should be so happy together\r\nto-day. Suddenly, moved by I know not what impulse, I turned abruptly\r\nround, and how can I describe to you my astonishment when I saw my\r\nbrother advancing slowly towards me from the southern side of the\r\nsquare, accompanied by another person. My first thought, I remember, had\r\nin it something of resentment that this man, whoever he was, should\r\nintrude himself into our meeting; I wondered who it could possibly be,\r\nfor my brother had, I may say, no intimate friends. Then as I looked\r\nstill at the advancing figures, another feeling took possession of me;\r\nit was a sensation of bristling fear, the fear of the child in the dark,\r\nunreasonable and unreasoning, but terrible, clutching at my heart as\r\nwith the cold grip of a dead man\'s hands. Yet I overcame the feeling,\r\nand looked steadily at my brother, waiting for him to speak, and more\r\nclosely at his companion. Then I noticed that this man was leading my\r\nbrother rather than walking arm-in-arm with him; he was a tall man,\r\ndressed in quite ordinary fashion. He wore a high bowler hat, and, in\r\nspite of the warmth of the day, a plain black overcoat, tightly\r\nbuttoned, and I noticed his trousers, of a quiet black and gray stripe.\r\nThe face was commonplace too, and indeed I cannot recall any special\r\nfeatures, or any trick of expression; for though I looked at him as he\r\ncame near, curiously enough his face made no impression on me, it was as\r\nthough I had seen a well-made mask. They passed in front of me, and to\r\nmy unutterable astonishment I heard my brother\'s voice speaking to me,\r\nthough his lips did not move, nor his eyes look into mine. It was a\r\nvoice I cannot describe, though I knew it, but the words came to my ears\r\nas if mingled with plashing water and the sound of a shallow brook\r\nflowing amidst stones. I heard, then, the words, \'I cannot stay,\' and\r\nfor a moment the heavens and the earth seemed to rush together with the\r\nsound of thunder, and I was thrust forth from the world into a black\r\nvoid without beginning and without end. For, as my brother passed me, I\r\nsaw the hand that held him by the arm, and seemed to guide him, and in\r\none moment of horror I realized that it was as a formless thing that has\r\nmouldered for many years in the grave. The flesh was peeled in strips\r\nfrom the bones, and hung apart dry and granulated, and the fingers that\r\nencircled my brother\'s arm were all unshapen, claw-like things, and one\r\nwas but a stump from which the end had rotted off. When I recovered my\r\nsenses I saw the two passing out by that gate. I paused for a moment,\r\nand then with a rush as of fire to my heart I knew that no horror\r\ncould, stay me, but that I must follow my brother and save him, even\r\nthough all hell rose up against me. I ran out and looked up the\r\npavement, and saw the two figures walking amidst the crowd. I ran across\r\nthe road, and saw them turn up that side street, and I reached the\r\ncorner a moment later. In vain I looked to right and left, for neither\r\nmy brother nor his strange guardian was in sight; two elderly men were\r\ncoming down arm-in-arm, and a telegraph boy was walking lustily along\r\nwhistling. I remained there a moment horror-struck, and then I bowed my\r\nhead and returned to this seat, where you found me. Now, sir, do you\r\nwonder at my grief? Oh, tell me what has happened to my brother, or I\r\nfeel I shall go mad."\r\n\r\nMr. Phillipps, who had listened with exemplary patience to this tale,\r\nhesitated a moment before he spoke.\r\n\r\n"My dear madam," he said at length, "you have known how to engage me in\r\nyour service, not only as a man, but as a student of science. As a\r\nfellow-creature I pity you most profoundly; you must have suffered\r\nextremely from what you saw, or rather from what you fancied you saw.\r\nFor, as a scientific observer, it is my duty to tell you the plain\r\ntruth, which, indeed, besides being true, must also console you. Allow\r\nme to ask you then to describe your brother."\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said the lady, eagerly; "I can describe him accurately. My\r\nbrother is a somewhat young-looking man; he is pale, has small black\r\nwhiskers, and wears spectacles. He has rather a timid, almost a\r\nfrightened expression, and looks about him nervously from side to side.\r\nThink, think! Surely you must have seen him. Perhaps you are an\r\n_habitue_ of this engaging quarter; you may have met him on some\r\nprevious Saturday. I may have been mistaken in supposing that he turned\r\nup that side street; he may have gone on, and you may have passed each\r\nother. Oh, tell me, sir, whether you have not seen him?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid I do not keep a very sharp lookout when I am walking," said\r\nPhillipps, who would have passed his mother unnoticed; "but I am sure\r\nyour description is admirable. And now will you describe the person,\r\nwho, you say, held your brother by the arm?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot do so. I told you, his face seemed devoid of expression or\r\nsalient feature. It was like a mask."\r\n\r\n"Exactly; you cannot describe what you have never seen. I need hardly\r\npoint out to you the conclusion to be drawn; you have been the victim of\r\nan hallucination. You expected to see your brother, you were alarmed\r\nbecause you did not see him, and unconsciously, no doubt, your brain\r\nwent to work, and finally you saw a mere projection of your own morbid\r\nthoughts; a vision of your absent brother, and a mere confusion of\r\nterrors incorporated in a figure which you can\'t describe. Of course\r\nyour brother has been in some way prevented from coming to meet you as\r\nusual. I expect you will hear from him in a day or two."\r\n\r\nThe lady looked seriously at Mr. Phillipps, and then for a second there\r\nseemed almost a twinkling as of mirth about her eyes, but her face\r\nclouded sadly at the dogmatic conclusions to which the scientist was\r\nled so irresistibly.\r\n\r\n"Ah," she said, "you do not know. I cannot doubt the evidence of my\r\nwaking senses. Besides, perhaps I have had experiences even more\r\nterrible. I acknowledge the force of your arguments, but a woman has\r\nintuitions which never deceive her. Believe me, I am not hysterical;\r\nfeel my pulse, it is quite regular."\r\n\r\nShe stretched out her hand with a dainty gesture, and a glance that\r\nenraptured Phillipps in spite of himself. The hand held out to him was\r\nsoft and white and warm, and as, in some confusion, he placed his\r\nfingers on the purple vein, he felt profoundly touched by the spectacle\r\nof love and grief before him.\r\n\r\n"No," he said, as he released her wrist, "as you say, you are evidently\r\nquite yourself. Still, you must be aware that living men do not possess\r\ndead hands. That sort of thing doesn\'t happen. It is, of course, barely\r\npossible that you did see your brother with another gentleman, and that\r\nimportant business prevented him from stopping. As for the wonderful\r\nhand, there may have been some deformity, a finger shot off by accident,\r\nor something of that sort."\r\n\r\nThe lady shook her head mournfully.\r\n\r\n"I see you are a determined rationalist," she said. "Did you not hear me\r\nsay that I have had experiences even more terrible? I too was once a\r\nsceptic, but after what I have known I can no longer affect to doubt."\r\n\r\n"Madam," replied Mr. Phillipps, "no one shall make me deny my faith. I\r\nwill never believe, nor will I pretend to believe, that two and two make\r\nfive, nor will I on any pretences admit the existence of two-sided\r\ntriangles."\r\n\r\n"You are a little hasty," rejoined the lady. "But may I ask you if you\r\never heard the name of Professor Gregg, the authority on ethnology and\r\nkindred subjects?"\r\n\r\n"I have done much more than merely hear of Professor Gregg," said\r\nPhillipps. "I always regarded him as one of our most acute and\r\nclear-headed observers; and his last publication, the \'Text-book of\r\nEthnology,\' struck me as being quite admirable in its kind. Indeed, the\r\nbook had but come into my hands when I heard of the terrible accident\r\nwhich cut short Gregg\'s career. He had, I think, taken a country house\r\nin the West of England for the summer, and is supposed to have fallen\r\ninto a river. So far as I remember, his body was never recovered."\r\n\r\n"Sir, I am sure that you are discreet. Your conversation seems to\r\ndeclare as much, and the very title of that little work of yours which\r\nyou mentioned, assures me that you are no empty trifler. In a word, I\r\nfeel that I may depend on you. You appear to be under the impression\r\nthat Professor Gregg is dead; I have no reason to believe that that is\r\nthe case."\r\n\r\n"What?" cried Phillipps, astonished and perturbed. "You do not hint that\r\nthere was anything disgraceful? I cannot believe it. Gregg was a man of\r\nclearest character; his private life was one of great benevolence; and\r\nthough I myself am free from delusions, I believe him to have been a\r\nsincere and devout Christian. Surely you cannot mean to insinuate that\r\nsome disreputable history forced him to flee the country?"\r\n\r\n"Again you are in a hurry," replied the lady. "I said nothing of all\r\nthis. Briefly, then, I must tell you that Professor Gregg left his house\r\none morning in full health both of mind and body. He never returned, but\r\nhis watch and chain, a purse containing three sovereigns in gold and\r\nsome loose silver, with a ring that he wore habitually, were found three\r\ndays later on a wild and savage hillside, many miles from the river.\r\nThese articles were placed beside a limestone rock of fantastic form;\r\nthey had been wrapped into a parcel with a kind of rough parchment which\r\nwas secured with gut. The parcel was opened, and the inner side of the\r\nparchment bore an inscription done with some red substance; the\r\ncharacters were undecipherable, but seemed to be a corrupt cuneiform."\r\n\r\n"You interest me intensely," said Phillips. "Would you mind continuing\r\nyour story? The circumstance you have mentioned seems to me of the most\r\ninexplicable character, and I thirst for an elucidation."\r\n\r\nThe young lady seemed to meditate for a moment, and she then proceeded\r\nto relate the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL OF THE BLACK SEAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nI must now give you some fuller particulars of my history. I am the\r\ndaughter of a civil engineer, Steven Lally by name, who was so\r\nunfortunate as to die suddenly at the outset of his career, and before\r\nhe had accumulated sufficient means to support his wife and her two\r\nchildren. My mother contrived to keep the small household going on\r\nresources which must have been incredibly small; we lived in a remote\r\ncountry village, because most of the necessaries of life were cheaper\r\nthan in a town, but even so we were brought up with the severest\r\neconomy. My father was a clever and well-read man, and left behind him a\r\nsmall but select collection of books, containing the best Greek, Latin,\r\nand English classics, and these books were the only amusement we\r\npossessed. My brother, I remember, learned Latin out of Descartes\'\r\n"Meditationes," and I, in place of the little tales which children are\r\nusually told to read, had nothing more charming than a translation of\r\nthe "Gesta Romanorum." We grew up thus, quiet and studious children, and\r\nin course of time my brother provided for himself in the manner I have\r\nmentioned. I continued to live at home; my poor mother had become an\r\ninvalid, and demanded my continual care, and about two years ago she\r\ndied after many months of painful illness. My situation was a terrible\r\none; the shabby furniture barely sufficed to pay the debts I had been\r\nforced to contract, and the books I despatched to my brother, knowing\r\nhow he would value them. I was absolutely alone. I was aware how poorly\r\nmy brother was paid; and though I came up to London in the hope of\r\nfinding employment, with the understanding that he would defray my\r\nexpenses, I swore it should only be for a month, and that if I could not\r\nin that time find some work, I would starve rather than deprive him of\r\nthe few miserable pounds he had laid by for his day of trouble. I took a\r\nlittle room in a distant suburb, the cheapest that I could find. I lived\r\non bread and tea, and I spent my time in vain answering of\r\nadvertisements, and vainer walks to addresses I had noted. Day followed\r\non day, and week on week, and still I was unsuccessful, till at last the\r\nterm I had appointed drew to a close, and I saw before me the grim\r\nprospect of slowly dying of starvation. My landlady was good-natured in\r\nher way; she knew the slenderness of my means, and I am sure that she\r\nwould not have turned me out of doors. It remained for me then to go\r\naway, and to try and die in some quiet place. It was winter then, and a\r\nthick white fog gathered in the early part of the afternoon, becoming\r\nmore dense as the day wore on; it was a Sunday, I remember, and the\r\npeople of the house were at chapel. At about three o\'clock I crept out\r\nand walked away as quickly as I could, for I was weak from abstinence.\r\nThe white mist wrapped all the streets in silence, and a hard frost had\r\ngathered thick upon the bare branches of the trees, and frost crystals\r\nglittered on the wooden fences, and on the cold cruel ground beneath my\r\nfeet. I walked on, turning to right and left in utter haphazard, without\r\ncaring to look up at the names of the streets, and all that I remember\r\nof my walk on that Sunday afternoon seems but the broken fragments of an\r\nevil dream. In a confused vision I stumbled on, through roads half town\r\nand half country; gray fields melting into the cloudy world of mist on\r\none side of me, and on the other comfortable villas with a glow of\r\nfirelight flickering on the walls; but all unreal, red brick walls, and\r\nlighted windows, vague trees, and glimmering country, gas-lamps\r\nbeginning to star the white shadows, the vanishing perspectives of the\r\nrailway line beneath high embankments, the green and red of the signal\r\nlamps,--all these were but momentary pictures flashed on my tired brain\r\nand senses numbed by hunger. Now and then I would hear a quick step\r\nringing on the iron road, and men would pass me well wrapped up, walking\r\nfast for the sake of warmth, and no doubt eagerly foretasting the\r\npleasures of a glowing hearth, with curtains tightly drawn about the\r\nfrosted panes, and the welcomes of their friends; but as the early\r\nevening darkened and night approached, foot-passengers got fewer and\r\nfewer, and I passed through street after street alone. In the white\r\nsilence I stumbled on, as desolate as if I trod the streets of a buried\r\ncity; and as I grew more weak and exhausted, something of the horror of\r\ndeath was folding thickly round my heart. Suddenly, as I turned a\r\ncorner, some one accosted me courteously beneath the lamp-post, and I\r\nheard a voice asking if I could kindly point the way to Avon Road. At\r\nthe sudden shock of human accents I was prostrated and my strength gave\r\nway, and I fell all huddled on the side-walk and wept and sobbed and\r\nlaughed in violent hysteria. I had gone out prepared to die, and as I\r\nstepped across the threshold that had sheltered me, I consciously bade\r\nadieu to all hopes and all remembrances; the door clanged behind me with\r\nthe noise of thunder, and I felt that an iron curtain had fallen on the\r\nbrief passages of my life, and that henceforth I was to walk a little\r\nway in a world, of gloom and shadow; I entered on the stage of the first\r\nact of death. Then came my wandering in the mist, the whiteness wrapping\r\nall things, the void streets, and muffled silence, till when that voice\r\nspoke to me, it was as if I had died and life returned to me. In a few\r\nminutes I was able to compose my feelings, and as I rose I saw that I\r\nwas confronted by a middle-aged gentleman of specious appearance, neatly\r\nand correctly dressed. He looked at me with an expression of great pity,\r\nbut before I could stammer out my ignorance of the neighborhood, for\r\nindeed I had not the slightest notion of where I had wandered, he spoke.\r\n\r\n"My dear madam," he said, "you seem in some terrible distress. You\r\ncannot think how you alarmed me. But may I inquire the nature of your\r\ntrouble? I assure you that you can safely confide in me."\r\n\r\n"You are very kind," I replied; "but, I fear there is nothing to be\r\ndone. My condition seems a hopeless one."\r\n\r\n"Oh, nonsense, nonsense! You are too young to talk like that. Come, let\r\nus walk down here, and you must tell me your difficulty. Perhaps I may\r\nbe able to help you."\r\n\r\nThere was something very soothing and persuasive in his manner, and as\r\nwe walked together, I gave him an outline of my story, and told of the\r\ndespair that had oppressed me almost to death.\r\n\r\n"You were wrong to give in so completely," he said, when I was silent.\r\n"A month is too short a time in which to feel one\'s way in London.\r\nLondon, let me tell you, Miss Lally, does not lie open and undefended;\r\nit is a fortified place, fossed and double-moated with curious\r\nintricacies. As must always happen in large towns, the conditions of\r\nlife have become hugely artificial; no mere simple palisade is run up to\r\noppose the man or woman who would take the place by storm, but serried\r\nlines of subtle contrivances, mines, and pitfalls which it needs a\r\nstrange skill to overcome. You, in your simplicity, fancied you had only\r\nto shout for these walls to sink into nothingness, but the time is gone\r\nfor such startling victories as these. Take courage; you will learn the\r\nsecret of success before very long."\r\n\r\n"Alas, sir," I replied, "I have no doubt your conclusions are correct,\r\nbut at the present moment I seem to be in a fair way to die of\r\nstarvation. You spoke of a secret; for heaven\'s sake, tell it me, if you\r\nhave any pity for my distress."\r\n\r\nHe laughed genially. "There lies the strangeness of it all. Those who\r\nknow the secret cannot tell it if they would; it is positively as\r\nineffable as the central doctrine of Freemasonry. But I may say this,\r\nthat you yourself have penetrated at least the outer husk of the\r\nmystery," and he laughed again.\r\n\r\n"Pray do not jest with me," I said. "What have I done, _que sais-je_? I\r\nam so far ignorant that I have not the slightest idea of how my next\r\nmeal is to be provided."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me. You ask what you have done? You have met me. Come, we will\r\nfence no longer. I see you have self-education, the only education\r\nwhich is not infinitely pernicious, and I am in want of a governess for\r\nmy two children. I have been a widower for some years; my name is Gregg.\r\nI offer you the post I have named, and shall we say a salary of a\r\nhundred a year?"\r\n\r\nI could only stutter out my thanks, and slipping a card with his address\r\nand a bank-note by way of earnest into my hand, Mr. Gregg bade me\r\ngood-bye, asking me to call in a day or two.\r\n\r\nSuch was my introduction to Professor Gregg, and can you wonder that the\r\nremembrance of despair and the cold blast that had blown from the gates\r\nof death upon me, made me regard him as a second father? Before the\r\nclose of the week. I was installed in my new duties; the professor had\r\nleased an old brick manor house in a western suburb of London, and here,\r\nsurrounded by pleasant lawns and orchards, and soothed with the murmur\r\nof the ancient elms that rocked their boughs above the roof, the new\r\nchapter of my life began. Knowing as you do the nature of the\r\nprofessor\'s occupations, you will not be surprised to hear that the\r\nhouse teemed with books; and cabinets full of strange and even hideous\r\nobjects filled every available nook in the vast low rooms. Gregg was a\r\nman whose one thought was for knowledge, and I too before long caught\r\nsomething of his enthusiasm, and strove to enter into his passion for\r\nresearch. In a few months I was perhaps more his secretary than the\r\ngoverness of the two children, and many a night I have sat at the desk\r\nin the glow of the shaded lamp while he, pacing up and down in the rich,\r\ngloom of the firelight, dictated to me the substance of his "Text-book\r\nof Ethnology." But amidst these more sober and accurate studies I always\r\ndetected a something hidden, a longing and desire for some object to\r\nwhich he did not allude, and now and then he would break short in what\r\nhe was saying and lapse into revery, entranced, as it seemed to me, by\r\nsome distant prospect of adventurous discovery. The text-book was at\r\nlast finished, and we began to receive proofs from the printers, which\r\nwere intrusted to me for a first reading, and then underwent the final\r\nrevision of the professor. All the while his weariness of the actual\r\nbusiness he was engaged on increased, and it was with the joyous laugh\r\nof a schoolboy when term is over that he one day handed me a copy of the\r\nbook. "There," he said, "I have kept my word; I promised to write it,\r\nand it is done with. Now I shall be free to live for stranger things; I\r\nconfess it, Miss Lally, I covet the renown of Columbus. You will, I\r\nhope, see me play the part of an explorer."\r\n\r\n"Surely," I said, "there is little left to explore. You have been born a\r\nfew hundred years too late for that."\r\n\r\n"I think you are wrong," he replied; "there are still, depend upon it,\r\nquaint undiscovered countries and continents of strange extent. Ah, Miss\r\nLally, believe me, we stand amidst sacraments and mysteries full of awe,\r\nand it doth not yet appear what we shall be. Life, believe me, is no\r\nsimple thing, no mass of gray matter and congeries of veins and muscles\r\nto be laid naked by the surgeon\'s knife; man is the secret which I am\r\nabout to explore, and before I can discover him I must cross over\r\nweltering seas indeed, and oceans and the mists of many thousand years.\r\nYou know the myth of the lost Atlantis; what if it be true, and I am\r\ndestined to be called the discoverer of that wonderful land?"\r\n\r\nI could see excitement boiling beneath his words, and in his face was\r\nthe heat of the hunter; before me stood a man who believed himself\r\nsummoned to tourney with the unknown. A pang of joy possessed me when I\r\nreflected that I was to be in a way associated with him in the\r\nadventure, and I too burned with the lust of the chase, not pausing to\r\nconsider that I knew not what we were to unshadow.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Professor Gregg took me into his inner study, where\r\nranged against the wall stood a nest of pigeon-holes, every drawer\r\nneatly labelled, and the results of years of toil classified in a few\r\nfeet of space.\r\n\r\n"Here," he said, "is my life; here are all the facts which I have\r\ngathered together with so much pains, and yet it is all nothing. No,\r\nnothing to what I am about to attempt. Look at this;" and he took me to\r\nan old bureau, a piece fantastic and faded, which stood in a corner of\r\nthe room. He unlocked the front and opened one of the drawers.\r\n\r\n"A few scraps of paper," he went on, pointing to the drawer, "and a lump\r\nof black stone, rudely annotated with queer marks and scratches,--that\r\nis all that drawer holds. Here you see is an old envelope with the dark\r\nred stamp of twenty years ago, but I have pencilled a few lines at the\r\nback; here is a sheet of manuscript, and here some cuttings from\r\nobscure local journals. And if you ask me the subject matter of the\r\ncollection, it will not seem extraordinary. A servant girl at a\r\nfarmhouse, who disappeared from her place and has never been heard of, a\r\nchild supposed to have slipped down some old working on the mountains,\r\nsome queer scribbling on a limestone rock, a man murdered with a blow\r\nfrom a strange weapon; such is the scent I have to go upon. Yes, as you\r\nsay, there is a ready explanation for all this; the girl may have run\r\naway to London, or Liverpool, or New York; the child may be at the\r\nbottom of the disused shaft; and the letters on the rock may be the idle\r\nwhims of some vagrant. Yes, yes, I admit all that; but I know I hold the\r\ntrue key. Look!" and he held me out a slip of yellow paper.\r\n\r\n"Characters found inscribed on a limestone rock on the Gray Hills," I\r\nread, and then there was a word erased, presumably the name of a county,\r\nand a date some fifteen years back. Beneath was traced a number of\r\nuncouth characters, shaped somewhat like wedges or daggers, as strange\r\nand outlandish as the Hebrew alphabet.\r\n\r\n"Now the seal," said Professor Gregg, and he handed me the black stone,\r\na thing about two inches long, and something like an old-fashioned\r\ntobacco stopper, much enlarged.\r\n\r\nI held it up to the light, and saw to my surprise the characters on the\r\npaper repeated on the seal.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the professor, "they are the same. And the marks on the\r\nlimestone rock were made fifteen years ago, with some red substance. And\r\nthe characters on the seal are four thousand years old at least. Perhaps\r\nmuch more."\r\n\r\n"Is it a hoax?" I said.\r\n\r\n"No, I anticipated that. I was not to be led to give my life to a\r\npractical joke. I have tested the matter very carefully. Only one person\r\nbesides myself knows of the mere existence of that black seal. Besides,\r\nthere are other reasons which I cannot enter into now."\r\n\r\n"But what does it all mean?" I said. "I cannot understand to what\r\nconclusion all this leads."\r\n\r\n"My dear Miss Lally, that is a question I would rather leave unanswered\r\nfor some little time. Perhaps I shall never be able to say what secrets\r\nare held here in solution; a few vague hints, the outlines of village\r\ntragedies, a few marks done with red earth upon a rock, and an ancient\r\nseal. A queer set of data to go upon? Half-a-dozen pieces of evidence,\r\nand twenty years before even so much could be got together; and who\r\nknows what mirage or terra incognita may be beyond all this? I look\r\nacross deep waters, Miss Lally, and the land beyond may be but a haze\r\nafter all. But still I believe it is not so, and a few months will show\r\nwhether I am right or wrong."\r\n\r\nHe left me, and alone I endeavored to fathom the mystery, wondering to\r\nwhat goal such eccentric odds and ends of evidence could lead. I myself\r\nam not wholly devoid of imagination, and I had reason to respect the\r\nprofessor\'s solidity of intellect; yet I saw in the contents of the\r\ndrawer but the materials of fantasy, and vainly tried to conceive what\r\ntheory could be founded on the fragments that had been placed before me.\r\nIndeed, I could discover in what I had heard and seen but the first\r\nchapter of an extravagant romance; and yet deep in my heart I burned\r\nwith curiosity, and day after day I looked eagerly in Professor Gregg\'s\r\nface for some hint of what was to happen.\r\n\r\nIt was one evening after dinner that the word came.\r\n\r\n"I hope you can make your preparations without much trouble," he said\r\nsuddenly to me. "We shall be leaving here in a week\'s time."\r\n\r\n"Really!" I said in astonishment. "Where are we going?"\r\n\r\n"I have taken a country house in the west of England, not far from\r\nCaermaen, a quiet little town, once a city, and the headquarters of a\r\nRoman legion. It is very dull there, but the country is pretty, and the\r\nair is wholesome."\r\n\r\nI detected a glint in his eyes, and guessed that this sudden move had\r\nsome relation to our conversation of a few days before.\r\n\r\n"I shall just take a few books with me," said Professor Gregg, "that is\r\nall. Everything else will remain here for our return. I have got a\r\nholiday," he went on, smiling at me, "and I shan\'t be sorry to be quit\r\nfor a time of my old bones and stones and rubbish. Do you know," he went\r\non, "I have been grinding away at facts for thirty years; it is time for\r\nfancies."\r\n\r\nThe days passed quickly; I could see that the professor was all\r\nquivering with suppressed excitement, and I could scarce credit the\r\neager appetence of his glance as we left the old manor house behind us,\r\nand began our journey. We set out at mid-day, and it was in the dusk of\r\nthe evening that we arrived at a little country station. I was tired,\r\nand excited, and the drive through, the lanes seems all a dream. First\r\nthe deserted streets of a forgotten village, while I heard Professor\r\nGregg\'s voice talking of the Augustan Legion and the clash of arms, and\r\nall the tremendous pomp that followed the eagles; then the broad river\r\nswimming to full tide with the last afterglow glimmering duskily in the\r\nyellow water, the wide meadows, and the cornfields whitening, and the\r\ndeep lane winding on the slope between the hills and the water. At last\r\nwe began to ascend, and the air grew rarer; I looked down and saw the\r\npure white mist tracking the outline of the river like a shroud, and a\r\nvague and shadowy country, imaginations and fantasy of swelling hills\r\nand hanging woods, and half-shaped outlines of hills beyond, stand in\r\nthe distance the glare of the furnace fire on the mountain, growing by\r\nturns a pillar of shining flame, and fading to a dull point of red. We\r\nwere slowly mounting a carriage drive, and then there came to me the\r\ncool breath and the scent of the great wood that was above us; I seemed\r\nto wander in its deepest depths, and there was the sound of trickling\r\nwater, the scent of the green leaves, and the breath of the summer\r\nnight. The carriage stopped at last, and I could scarcely distinguish\r\nthe form of the house as I waited a moment at the pillared porch; and\r\nthe rest of the evening seemed a dream of strange things bounded by the\r\ngreat silence of the wood and the valley and the river.\r\n\r\nThe next morning when I awoke and looked out of the bow window of the\r\nbig old-fashioned bedroom, I saw under a gray sky a country that was\r\nstill all mystery. The long, lovely valley, with the river winding in\r\nand out below, crossed, in mid vision by a mediaeval bridge of vaulted\r\nand buttressed stone, the clear presence of the rising ground beyond,\r\nand the woods that I had only seen in shadow the night before, seemed\r\ntinged with enchantment, and the soft breath, of air that sighed in at\r\nthe opened pane was like no other wind. I looked across the valley, and\r\nbeyond, hill followed on hill as wave on wave, and here a faint blue\r\npillar of smoke rose still in the morning air from the chimney of an\r\nancient gray farmhouse, there was a rugged height crowned with dark\r\nfirs, and in the distance I saw the white streak of a road that climbed\r\nand vanished into some unimagined country. But the boundary of all was a\r\ngreat wall of mountain, vast in the west, and ending like a fortress\r\nwith a steep ascent and a domed tumulus clear against the sky.\r\n\r\nI saw Professor Gregg walking up and down the terrace path below the\r\nwindows, and it was evident that he was revelling in the sense of\r\nliberty, and the thought that he had, for a while, bidden good-bye to\r\ntask-work. When I joined him there was exultation in his voice as he\r\npointed out the sweep of valley and the river that wound beneath the\r\nlovely hills.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, "it is a strangely beautiful country; and to me, at\r\nleast, it seems full of mystery. You have not forgotten the drawer I\r\nshowed you, Miss Lally? No; and you have guessed that I have come here\r\nnot merely for the sake of the children and the fresh air?"\r\n\r\n"I think I have guessed as much as that," I replied; "but you must\r\nremember I do not know the mere nature of your investigations; and as\r\nfor the connection between the search and this wonderful valley, it is\r\npast my guessing."\r\n\r\nHe smiled queerly at me. "You must not think I am making a mystery for\r\nthe sake of mystery," he said. "I do not speak out because, so far,\r\nthere is nothing to be spoken, nothing definite I mean, nothing that can\r\nbe set down in hard black and white, as dull and sure and irreproachable\r\nas any blue book. And then I have another reason: many years ago a\r\nchance paragraph in a newspaper caught my attention, and focussed in an\r\ninstant the vagrant thoughts and half-formed fancies of many idle and\r\nspeculative hours into a certain hypothesis. I saw at once that I was\r\ntreading on a thin crust; my theory was wild and fantastic in the\r\nextreme, and I would not for any consideration have written a hint of it\r\nfor publication. But I thought that in the company of scientific men\r\nlike myself, men who knew the course of discovery, and were aware that\r\nthe gas that blazes and flares in the gin-palace was once a wild\r\nhypothesis; I thought that with such men as these I might hazard my\r\ndream--let us say Atlantis, or the philosopher\'s stone, or what you\r\nlike--without danger of ridicule. I found I was grossly mistaken; my\r\nfriends looked blankly at me and at one another, and I could see\r\nsomething of pity, and something also of insolent contempt, in the\r\nglances they exchanged. One of them called on me next day, and hinted\r\nthat I must be suffering from overwork and brain exhaustion. \'In plain\r\nterms,\' I said, \'you think I am going mad. I think not;\' and I showed\r\nhim out with some little appearance of heat. Since that day I vowed that\r\nI would never whisper the nature of my theory to any living soul; to no\r\none but yourself have I ever shown the contents of that drawer. After\r\nall, I may be following a rainbow; I may have been misled by the play of\r\ncoincidence; but as I stand here in this mystic hush and silence amidst\r\nthe woods and wild hills, I am more than ever sure that I am hot on the\r\nscent. Come, it is time we went in."\r\n\r\nTo me in all this there was something both of wonder and excitement; I\r\nknew how in his ordinary work Professor Gregg moved step by step,\r\ntesting every inch of the way, and never venturing on assertion without\r\nproof that was impregnable. Yet I divined more from his glance and the\r\nvehemence of his tone than from the spoken word that he had in his every\r\nthought the vision of the almost incredible continually with him; and I,\r\nwho was with some share of imagination no little of a sceptic, offended\r\nat a hint of the marvellous, could not help asking myself whether he was\r\ncherishing a monomania, and barring out from this one subject all the\r\nscientific method of his other life.\r\n\r\nYet, with, this image of mystery haunting my thoughts, I surrendered\r\nwholly to the charm of the country. Above the faded house on the\r\nhillside began the great forest; a long dark line seen from the opposing\r\nhills, stretching above the river for many a mile from north to south,\r\nand yielding in the north to even wilder country, barren and savage\r\nhills, and ragged common land, a territory all strange and unvisited,\r\nand more unknown to Englishmen than the very heart of Africa. The space\r\nof a couple of steep fields alone separated the house from the wood, and\r\nthe children were delighted to follow me up the long alleys of\r\nundergrowth, between smooth pleached walls of shining beech, to the\r\nhighest point in the wood, whence one looked on one side across the\r\nriver and the rise and fall of the country to the great western mountain\r\nwall, and on the other, over the surge and dip of the myriad trees of\r\nthe forest, over level meadows and the shining yellow sea to the faint\r\ncoast beyond. I used to sit at this point on the warm sunlit turf which\r\nmarked the track of the Roman Road, while the two children raced about\r\nhunting for the whinberries that grew here and there on the banks. Here\r\nbeneath the deep blue sky and the great clouds rolling, like olden\r\ngalleons with sails full-bellied, from the sea to the hills, as I\r\nlistened to the whispered charm of the great and ancient wood, I lived\r\nsolely for delight, and only remembered strange things when we would\r\nreturn to the house, and find Professor Gregg either shut up in the\r\nlittle room he had made his study, or else pacing the terrace with the\r\nlook, patient and enthusiastic, of the determined seeker.\r\n\r\nOne morning, some eight or nine days after our arrival, I looked out of\r\nmy window and saw the whole landscape transmuted before me. The clouds\r\nhad dipped low and hidden the mountain in the west, and a southern wind\r\nwas driving the rain in shifting pillars up the valley, and the little\r\nbrooklet that burst the hill below the house now raged, a red torrent,\r\ndown to the river. We were perforce obliged to keep snug within doors,\r\nand when I had attended to my pupils, I sat down in the morning-room\r\nwhere the ruins of a library still encumbered an old-fashioned bookcase.\r\nI had inspected the shelves once or twice, but their contents had failed\r\nto attract me; volumes of eighteenth century sermons, an old book on\r\nfarriery, a collection of "Poems" by "persons of quality," Prideaux\'s\r\n"Connection," and an odd volume of Pope were the boundaries of the\r\nlibrary, and there seemed little doubt that everything of interest or\r\nvalue had been removed. Now, however, in desperation, I began to\r\nre-examine the musty sheepskin and calf bindings, and found, much to my\r\ndelight, a fine old quarto printed by the Stephani, containing the three\r\nbooks of Pomponius Mela, "De Situ Orbis," and other of the ancient\r\ngeographers. I knew enough of Latin to steer my way through an ordinary\r\nsentence, and I soon became absorbed in the odd mixture of fact and\r\nfancy; light shining on a little of the space of the world, and beyond\r\nmist and shadow and awful forms. Glancing over the clear-printed pages,\r\nmy attention was caught by the heading of a chapter in Solinus, and I\r\nread the words:--\r\n\r\nMIRA DE INTIMIS GENTIBUS LIBYAE, DE LAPIDE\r\n             HEXECONTALITHO.\r\n\r\n"The wonders of the people that inhabit the inner parts of Libya, and of\r\nthe stone called Sixtystone."\r\n\r\nThe odd title attracted me and I read on:--\r\n\r\n"Gens ista avia et secreta habitat, in montibus horrendis foeda\r\nmysteria celebrat. De hominibus nihil aliud illi praeferunt quam\r\nfiguram, ab humano ritu prorsus exulant, oderunt deum lucis. Stridunt\r\npotius quam loquuntur; vox absona nec sine horrore auditur. Lapide\r\nquodam gloriantur, quem Hexecontalithon vocant, dicunt enim hunc lapidem\r\nsexaginta notas ostendere. Cujus lapidis nomen secretum ineffabile\r\ncolunt: quod Ixaxar."\r\n\r\n"This folk," I translated to myself, "dwells in remote and secret\r\nplaces, and celebrates foul mysteries on savage hills. Nothing have they\r\nin common with men save the face, and the customs of humanity are wholly\r\nstrange to them; and they hate the sun. They hiss rather than speak;\r\ntheir voices are harsh, and not to be heard without fear. They boast of\r\na certain stone, which they call Sixtystone; for they say that it\r\ndisplays sixty characters. And this stone has a secret unspeakable name;\r\nwhich is Ixaxar."\r\n\r\nI laughed at the queer inconsequence of all this, and thought it fit for\r\nSinbad the Sailor or other of the supplementary Nights. When I saw\r\nProfessor Gregg in the course of the day, I told him of my find in the\r\nbookcase, and the fantastic rubbish I had been reading. To my surprise,\r\nhe looked up at me with an expression of great interest.\r\n\r\n"That is really very curious," he said. "I have never thought it worth\r\nwhile to look into the old geographers, and I daresay I have missed a\r\ngood deal. Ah, that is the passage, is it. It seems a shame to rob you\r\nof your entertainment, but I really think I must carry off the book."\r\n\r\nThe next day the professor called to me to come to the study. I found\r\nhim sitting at a table in the full light of the window, scrutinizing\r\nsomething very attentively with a magnifying-glass.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Miss Lally," he began, "I want to use your eyes. This glass is\r\npretty good, but not like my old one that I left in town. Would you\r\nmind examining the thing yourself, and telling me how many characters\r\nare cut on it?"\r\n\r\nHe handed me the object in his hand, and I saw that it was the black\r\nseal he had shown me in London, and my heart began to beat with the\r\nthought that I was presently to know something. I took the seal, and\r\nholding it up to the light checked off the grotesque dagger-shaped\r\ncharacters one by one.\r\n\r\n"I make sixty-two," I said at last.\r\n\r\n"Sixty-two? Nonsense; it\'s impossible. Ah, I see what you have done, you\r\nhave counted that and that," and he pointed to two marks which I had\r\ncertainly taken as letters with the rest.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," Professor Gregg went on; "but those are obvious scratches,\r\ndone accidentally; I saw that at once. Yes, then that\'s quite right.\r\nThank you very much, Miss Lally."\r\n\r\nI was going away, rather disappointed at my having been called in merely\r\nto count a number of marks on the black seal, when suddenly there\r\nflashed into my mind what I had read in the morning.\r\n\r\n"But, Professor Gregg, I cried, breathless, the seal, the seal. Why, it\r\nis the stone Hexecontalithos that Solinus writes of; it is Ixaxar."\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, "I suppose it is. Or it maybe a mere coincidence. It\r\nnever does to be too sure, you know, in these matters. Coincidence\r\nkilled the professor."\r\n\r\nI went away puzzled by what I had heard, and as much as ever at a loss\r\nto find the ruling clew in this maze of strange evidence. For three days\r\nthe bad weather lasted, changing from driving rain to a dense mist, fine\r\nand dripping, and we seemed to be shut up in a white cloud that veiled\r\nall the world away from us. All the while Professor Gregg was darkling\r\nin his room, unwilling, it appeared, to dispense confidences or talk of\r\nany kind, and I heard him walking to and fro with a quick, impatient\r\nstep, as if he were in some way wearied of inaction. The fourth morning\r\nwas fine, and at breakfast the professor said briskly:--\r\n\r\n"We want some extra help about the house; a boy of fifteen or sixteen,\r\nyou know. There are a lot of little odd jobs that take up the maids\'\r\ntime, which a boy could do much better."\r\n\r\n"The girls have not complained to me in any way," I replied. "Indeed,\r\nAnne said there was much less work than in London, owing to there being\r\nso little dust."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes, they are very good girls. But I think we shall do much better\r\nwith a boy. In fact, that is what has been bothering me for the last two\r\ndays."\r\n\r\n"Bothering you?" I said in astonishment, for as a matter of fact the\r\nprofessor never took the slightest interest in the affairs of the house.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, "the weather, you know. I really couldn\'t go out in that\r\nScotch mist; I don\'t know the country very well, and I should have lost\r\nmy way. But I am going to get the boy this morning."\r\n\r\n"But how do you know there is such a boy as you want anywhere about?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I have no doubt as to that. I may have to walk a mile or two at the\r\nmost, but I am sure to find just the boy I require."\r\n\r\nI thought the professor was poking, but though his tone was airy enough\r\nthere was something grim and set about his features that puzzled me. He\r\ngot his stick, and stood at the door looking meditatively before him,\r\nand as I passed through the hall he called to me.\r\n\r\n"By the way, Miss Lally, there was one thing I wanted to say to you. I\r\ndaresay you may have heard that some of these country lads are not over\r\nbright; idiotic would be a harsh word to use, and they are usually\r\ncalled \'naturals,\' or something of the kind, I hope you won\'t mind if\r\nthe boy I am after should turn out not too keen-witted; he will be\r\nperfectly harmless, of course, and blacking boots doesn\'t need much\r\nmental effort."\r\n\r\nWith that he was gone, striding up the road that led to the wood; and I\r\nremained stupefied, and then for the first time my astonishment was\r\nmingled with a sudden note of terror, arising I knew not whence, and all\r\nunexplained even to myself, and yet I felt about my heart for an instant\r\nsomething of the chill of death, and that shapeless, formless dread of\r\nthe unknown that is worse than death itself. I tried to find courage in\r\nthe sweet air that blew up from the sea, and in the sunlight after rain,\r\nbut the mystic woods seemed to darken around me; and the vision of the\r\nriver coiling between the reeds, and the silver gray of the ancient\r\nbridge, fashioned in my mind symbols of vague dread, as the mind of a\r\nchild fashions terror from things harmless and familiar.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later Professor Gregg returned. I met him as he came down the\r\nroad, and asked quietly if he had been able to find a boy.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," he answered; "I found one easily enough. His name is Jervase\r\nCradock, and I expect he will make himself very useful. His father has\r\nbeen dead for many years, and the mother, whom I saw, seemed very glad\r\nat the prospect of a few shillings extra coming in on Saturday nights.\r\nAs I expected, he is not too sharp, has fits at times, the mother said;\r\nbut as he will not be trusted with the china, that doesn\'t much matter,\r\ndoes it? And he is not in any way dangerous, you know, merely a little\r\nweak."\r\n\r\n"When is he coming?"\r\n\r\n"To-morrow morning at eight o\'clock. Anne will show him what he has to\r\ndo, and how to do it. At first he will go home every night, but perhaps\r\nit may ultimately turn out more convenient for him to sleep here, and\r\nonly go home for Sundays."\r\n\r\nI found nothing to say to all this. Professor Gregg spoke in a quiet\r\ntone of matter-of-fact, as indeed was warranted by the circumstance; and\r\nyet I could not quell my sensation of astonishment at the whole affair.\r\nI knew that in reality no assistance was wanted in the housework, and\r\nthe professor\'s prediction that the boy he was to engage might prove a\r\nlittle "simple," followed by so exact a fulfilment, struck me as bizarre\r\nin the extreme. The next morning I heard from, the housemaid that the\r\nboy Cradock had come at eight, and that she had been trying to make him\r\nuseful. "He doesn\'t seem quite all there, I don\'t think, miss," was her\r\ncomment; and later in the day I saw him helping the old man who worked\r\nin the garden. He was a youth of about fourteen, with black hair and\r\nblack eyes, and an olive skin, and I saw at once from the curious\r\nvacancy of his expression that he was mentally weak. He touched his\r\nforehead awkwardly as I went by, and I heard him answering the gardener\r\nin a queer, harsh voice that caught my attention; it gave me the\r\nimpression of some one speaking deep below under the earth, and there\r\nwas a strange sibilance, like the hissing of the phonograph as the\r\npointer travels over the cylinder. I heard that he seemed anxious to do\r\nwhat he could, and was quite docile and obedient, and Morgan the\r\ngardener, who knew his mother, assured me he was perfectly harmless.\r\n"He\'s always been a bit queer," he said, "and no wonder, after what his\r\nmother went through before he was born. I did know his father, Thomas\r\nCradock, well, and a very fine workman he was too, indeed. He got\r\nsomething wrong with his lungs owing to working in the wet woods, and\r\nnever got over it, and went off quite sudden like. And they do say as\r\nhow Mrs. Cradock was quite off her head; anyhow, she was found by Mr.\r\nHillyer, Ty Coch, all crouched up on the Gray Hills, over there, crying\r\nand weeping like a lost soul. And Jervase he was born about eight months\r\nafterwards, and as I was saying, he was a bit queer always; and they do\r\nsay when he could scarcely walk he would frighten the other children\r\ninto fits with the noises he would make."\r\n\r\nA word in the story had stirred up some remembrance within me, and\r\nvaguely curious, I asked the old man where the Gray Hills were.\r\n\r\n"Up there," he said, with the same gesture he had used before; "you go\r\npast the Fox and Hounds, and through the forest, by the old ruins. It\'s\r\na good five mile from here, and a strange sort of a place. The poorest\r\nsoil between this and Monmouth, they do say, though it\'s good feed for\r\nsheep. Yes, it was a sad thing for poor Mrs. Cradock."\r\n\r\nThe old man turned to his work, and I strolled on down the path between\r\nthe espaliers, gnarled and gouty with age, thinking of the story I had\r\nheard, and groping for the point in it that had some key to my memory.\r\nIn an instant it came before me; I had seen the phrase "Gray Hills" on\r\nthe slip of yellowed paper that Professor Gregg had taken from the\r\ndrawer in his cabinet. Again I was seized with pangs of mingled\r\ncuriosity and fear; I remembered the strange characters copied from the\r\nlimestone rock, and then again their identity with the inscription on\r\nthe age-old seal, and the fantastic fables of the Latin geographer. I\r\nsaw beyond doubt that, unless coincidence had set all the scene and\r\ndisposed all these bizarre events with curious art, I was to be a\r\nspectator of things far removed from the usual and customary traffic and\r\njostle of life. Professor Gregg I noted day by day. He was hot on his\r\ntrail, growing lean with eagerness; and in the evenings, when the sun\r\nwas swimming on the verge of the mountain, he would pace the terrace to\r\nand fro with his eyes on the ground, while the mist grew white in the\r\nvalley, and the stillness of the evening brought far voices near, and\r\nthe blue smoke rose a straight column from the diamond-shaped chimney of\r\nthe gray farmhouse, just as I had seen it on the first morning. I have\r\ntold you I was of sceptical habit; but though I understood little or\r\nnothing, I began to dread, vainly proposing to myself the iterated\r\ndogmas of science that all life is material, and that in the system of\r\nthings there is no undiscovered land even beyond the remotest stars,\r\nwhere the supernatural can find a footing. Yet there struck in on this\r\nthe thought that matter is as really awful and unknown as spirit, that\r\nscience itself but dallies on the threshold, scarcely gaining more than\r\na glimpse of the wonders of the inner place.\r\n\r\nThere is one day that stands up from amidst the others as a grim red\r\nbeacon, betokening evil to come. I was sitting on a bench in the garden,\r\nwatching the boy Cradock weeding, when I was suddenly alarmed by a harsh\r\nand choking sound, like the cry of a wild beast in anguish, and I was\r\nunspeakably shocked to see the unfortunate lad standing in full view\r\nbefore me, his whole body quivering and shaking at short intervals as\r\nthough shocks of electricity were passing through him, and his teeth\r\ngrinding, and foam gathering on his lips, and his face all swollen and\r\nblackened to a hideous mask of humanity. I shrieked with terror, and\r\nProfessor Gregg came running; and as I pointed to Cradock, the boy with\r\none convulsive shudder fell face forward, and lay on the wet earth, his\r\nbody writhing like a wounded blind-worm, and an inconceivable babble of\r\nsounds bursting and rattling and hissing from his lips; he seemed to\r\npour forth an infamous jargon, with words, or what seemed words, that\r\nmight have belonged to a tongue dead since untold ages, and buried deep\r\nbeneath Nilotic mud, or in the inmost recesses of the Mexican forest.\r\nFor a moment the thought passed through my mind, as my ears were still\r\nrevolted with that infernal clamor, "Surely this is the very speech of\r\nhell," and then I cried out again and again, and ran away shuddering to\r\nmy inmost soul. I had seen Professor Gregg\'s face as he stooped over the\r\nwretched boy and raised him, and I was appalled by the glow of\r\nexultation that shone on every lineament and feature. As I sat in my\r\nroom with drawn blinds, and my eyes hidden in my hands, I heard heavy\r\nsteps beneath, and I was told afterwards that Professor Gregg had\r\ncarried Cradock to his study, and had locked the door. I heard voices\r\nmurmur indistinctly, and I trembled to think of what might be passing\r\nwithin a few feet of where I sat; I longed to escape to the woods and\r\nsunshine, and yet I dreaded the sights that might confront me on the\r\nway. And at last, as I held the handle of the door nervously, I heard\r\nProfessor Gregg\'s voice calling to me with a cheerful ring: "It\'s all\r\nright now, Miss Lally," he said. "The poor fellow has got over it, and I\r\nhave been arranging for him to sleep here after to-morrow. Perhaps I may\r\nbe able to do something for him."\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said later, "it was a very painful sight, and I don\'t wonder\r\nyou were alarmed. We may hope that good food will build him up a little,\r\nbut I am afraid he will never be really cured;" and he affected the\r\ndismal and conventional air with which one speaks of hopeless illness,\r\nand yet beneath it I detected the delight that leapt up rampant within\r\nhim, and fought and struggled to find utterance. It was as if one\r\nglanced down on the even surface of the sea, clear and immobile, and saw\r\nbeneath raging depths, and a storm of contending billows. It was indeed\r\nto me a torturing and offensive problem that this man, who had so\r\nbounteously rescued me from the sharpness of death, and showed himself\r\nin all the relations of life full of benevolence and pity and kindly\r\nforethought, should so manifestly be for once on the side of the demons,\r\nand take a ghastly pleasure in the torments of an afflicted\r\nfellow-creature. Apart, I struggled with the horned difficulty, and\r\nstrove to find the solution, but without the hint of a clue; beset by\r\nmystery and contradiction, I saw nothing that might help me, and began\r\nto wonder whether, after all, I had not escaped from the white mist of\r\nthe suburb at too dear a rate. I hinted something of my thought to the\r\nprofessor; I said enough to let him know that I was in the most acute\r\nperplexity, but the moment after regretted what I had done, when I saw\r\nhis face contort with a spasm of pain.\r\n\r\n"My dear Miss Lally," he said, "you surely do not wish to leave us? No,\r\nno, you would not do it. You do not know how I rely on you; how\r\nconfidently I go forward, assured that you are here to watch over my\r\nchildren. You, Miss Lally, are my rear-guard; for, let me tell you, that\r\nthe business in which I am engaged is not wholly devoid of peril. You\r\nhave not forgotten what I said the first morning here; my lips are shut\r\nby an old and firm resolve, till they can open to utter no ingenious\r\nhypothesis or vague surmise but irrefragable fact, as certain as a\r\ndemonstration in mathematics. Think over it, Miss Lally, not for a\r\nmoment would I endeavor to keep you here against your own instincts, and\r\nyet I tell you frankly that I am persuaded that it is here, here amidst\r\nthe woods, that your duty lies."\r\n\r\nI was touched by the eloquence of his tone, and by the remembrance that\r\nthe man, after all, had been my salvation, and I gave him my hand on a\r\npromise to serve him loyally and without question. A few days later the\r\nrector of our church, a little church, gray and severe and quaint, that\r\nhovered on the very banks of the river and watched the tides swim and\r\nreturn, came to see us, and Professor Gregg easily persuaded him to stay\r\nand share our dinner. Mr. Meyrick was a member of an antique family of\r\nsquires, whose old manor house stood amongst the hills some seven miles\r\naway, and thus rooted in the soil, the rector was a living store of all\r\nthe old fading customs and lore of the country. His manner, genial with\r\na deal of retired oddity, won on Professor Gregg; and towards the\r\ncheese, when a curious Burgundy had begun its incantations, the two men\r\nglowed like the wine, and talked of philology with the enthusiasm of a\r\nburgess over the peerage. The parson was expounding the pronunciation of\r\nthe Welsh _ll_, and producing sounds like the gurgle of his native\r\nbrooks, when Professor Gregg struck in.\r\n\r\n"By the way," he said, "that was a very odd word I met with the other\r\nday. You know my boy, poor Jervase Cradock. Well, he has got the bad\r\nhabit of talking to himself, and the day before yesterday I was walking\r\nin the garden here and heard him; he was evidently quite unconscious of\r\nmy presence. A lot of what he said I couldn\'t make out, but one word,\r\nstruck me distinctly. It was such an odd sound; half-sibilant,\r\nhalf-guttural, and as quaint as those double _ll_\'s you have been\r\ndemonstrating. I do not know whether I can give you an idea of the\r\nsound. "Ishakshar" is perhaps as near as I can get; but the _k_ ought to\r\nbe a Greek _chi_ or a Spanish _j_. Now what does it mean in Welsh?"\r\n\r\n"In Welsh?" said the parson. "There is no such word in Welsh, nor any\r\nword remotely resembling it. I know the book-Welsh, as they call it, and\r\nthe colloquial dialects as well as any man, but there\'s no word like\r\nthat from Anglesea to Usk. Besides, none of the Cradocks speak a word of\r\nWelsh; it\'s dying out about here."\r\n\r\n"Really. You interest me extremely, Mr. Meyrick. I confess the word\r\ndidn\'t strike me as having the Welsh ring. But I thought it might be\r\nsome local corruption."\r\n\r\n"No, I never heard such a word, or anything like it. Indeed," he added,\r\nsmiling whimsically, "if it belongs to any language, I should say it\r\nmust be that of the fairies,--the Tylwydd Teg, as we call them."\r\n\r\nThe talk went on to the discovery of a Roman villa in the neighborhood;\r\nand soon after I left the room, and sat down apart to wonder at the\r\ndrawing together of such strange clues of evidence. As the professor had\r\nspoken of the curious word, I had caught the glint of his eye upon me;\r\nand though the pronunciation he gave was grotesque in the extreme, I\r\nrecognized the name of the stone of sixty characters mentioned by\r\nSolinus, the black seal shut up in some secret drawer of the study,\r\nstamped forever by a vanished race with signs that no man could read,\r\nsigns that might, for all I knew, be the veils of awful things done long\r\nago, and forgotten before the hills were moulded into form.\r\n\r\nWhen, the next morning, I came down, I found Professor Gregg pacing the\r\nterrace in his eternal walk.\r\n\r\n"Look at that bridge," he said when he saw me, "observe the quaint and\r\nGothic design, the angles between the arches, and the silvery gray of\r\nthe stone in the awe of the morning light. I confess it seems to me\r\nsymbolic; it should illustrate a mystical allegory of the passage from\r\none world to another."\r\n\r\n"Professor Gregg," I said quietly, "it is time that I knew something of\r\nwhat has happened, and of what is to happen."\r\n\r\nFor the moment he put me off, but I returned again with the same\r\nquestion in the evening, and then Professor Gregg flamed with\r\nexcitement. "Don\'t you understand yet?" he cried. "But I have told you a\r\ngood deal; yes, and shown you a good deal. You have heard pretty nearly\r\nall that I have heard, and seen what I have seen; or at least," and his\r\nvoice chilled as he spoke, "enough to make a good deal clear as noonday.\r\nThe servants told you, I have no doubt, that the wretched boy Cradock\r\nhad another seizure the night before last; he awoke me with cries in\r\nthat voice you heard in the garden, and I went to him, and God forbid\r\nyou should see what I saw that night. But all this is useless; my time\r\nhere is drawing to a close; I must be back in town in three weeks, as I\r\nhave a course of lectures to prepare, and need all my books about me. In\r\na very few days it will be all over, and I shall no longer hint, and no\r\nlonger be liable to ridicule as a madman and a quack. No, I shall speak\r\nplainly, and I shall be heard with such emotions as perhaps no other man\r\nhas ever drawn from the breasts of his fellows."\r\n\r\nHe paused, and seemed to grow radiant with the joy of great and\r\nwonderful discovery.\r\n\r\n"But all that is for the future, the near future certainly, but still\r\nthe future," he went on at length. "There is something to be done yet;\r\nyou will remember my telling you that my researches were not altogether\r\ndevoid of peril? Yes, there is a certain amount of danger to be faced; I\r\ndid not know how much when I spoke on the subject before, and to a\r\ncertain extent I am still in the dark. But it will be a strange\r\nadventure, the last of all, the last demonstration in the chain."\r\n\r\nHe was walking up and down the room as he spoke, and I could hear in his\r\nvoice the contending tones of exultation and despondence, or perhaps I\r\nshould say awe, the awe of a man who goes forth on unknown waters, and I\r\nthought of his allusion to Columbus on the night he had laid his book\r\nbefore me. The evening was a little chilly, and a fire of logs had been\r\nlighted in the study where we were, and the remittent flame and the glow\r\non the walls reminded me of the old days. I was sitting silent in an\r\narmchair by the fire, wondering over all I had heard, and still vainly\r\nspeculating as to the secret springs concealed from me under all the\r\nphantasmagoria I had witnessed, when I became suddenly aware of a\r\nsensation that change of some sort had been at work in the room, and\r\nthat there was something unfamiliar in its aspect. For some time I\r\nlooked about me, trying in vain to localize the alteration that I knew\r\nhad been made; the table by the window, the chairs, the faded settee\r\nwere all as I had known them. Suddenly, as a sought-for recollection\r\nflashes into the mind, I knew what was amiss. I was facing the\r\nprofessor\'s desk, which stood on the other side of the fire, and above\r\nthe desk was a grimy looking bust of Pitt, that I had never seen there\r\nbefore. And then I remembered the true position of this work of art; in\r\nthe furthest corner by the door was an old cupboard, projecting into the\r\nroom, and on the top of the cupboard, fifteen feet from the floor, the\r\nbust had been, and there no doubt it had delayed, accumulating dirt\r\nsince the early years of the century.\r\n\r\nI was utterly amazed, and sat silent still, in a confusion of thought.\r\nThere was, so far as I knew, no such thing as a step-ladder in the\r\nhouse, for I had asked for one to make some alterations in the curtains\r\nof my room; and a tall man standing on a chair would have found it\r\nimpossible to take down the bust. It had been placed not on the edge of\r\nthe cupboard, but far back against the wall; and Professor Gregg was, if\r\nanything, under the average height.\r\n\r\n"How on earth did you manage to get down Pitt?" I said at last.\r\n\r\nThe professor looked curiously at me, and seemed to hesitate a little.\r\n\r\n"They must have found you a step-ladder, or perhaps the gardener brought\r\nin a short ladder from outside."\r\n\r\n"No, I have had no ladder of any kind. Now, Miss Lally," he went on with\r\nan awkward simulation of jest, "there is a little puzzle for you; a\r\nproblem in the manner of the inimitable Holmes; there are the facts,\r\nplain and patent; summon your acuteness to the solution of the puzzle.\r\nFor Heaven\'s sake," he cried with a breaking voice, "say no more about\r\nit. I tell you, I never touched the thing," and he went out of the room\r\nwith horror manifest on his face, and his hand shook and jarred the door\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nI looked round the room in vague surprise, not at all realizing what had\r\nhappened, making vain and idle surmises by way of explanation, and\r\nwondering at the stirring of black waters by an idle word, and the\r\ntrivial change of an ornament. "This is some petty business, some whim\r\non which I have jarred," I reflected; "the professor is perhaps\r\nscrupulous and superstitious over trifles, and my question may have\r\noutraged unacknowledged fears, as though one killed a spider or spilled\r\nthe salt before the very eyes of a practical Scotchwoman." I was\r\nimmersed in these fond suspicions, and began to plume myself a little on\r\nmy immunity from such empty fears, when the truth fell heavily as lead\r\nupon my heart, and I recognized with cold terror that some awful\r\ninfluence had been at work. The bust was simply inaccessible; without a\r\nladder no one could have touched it.\r\n\r\nI went out to the kitchen and spoke as quietly as I could to the\r\nhousemaid.\r\n\r\n"Who moved that bust from the top of the cupboard, Anne?" I said to her.\r\n"Professor Gregg says he has not touched it. Did you find an old\r\nstep-ladder in one of the outhouses?"\r\n\r\nThe girl looked at me blankly.\r\n\r\n"I never touched it," she said. "I found it where it is now the other\r\nmorning when I dusted the room. I remember now, it, was Wednesday\r\nmorning, because it was the morning after Cradock was taken bad in the\r\nnight. My room is next to his, you know, miss," the girl went on\r\npiteously; "and it was awful to hear how he cried and called out names\r\nthat I couldn\'t understand. It made me feel all afraid, and then master\r\ncame, and I heard him speak, and he took down Cradock to the study and\r\ngave him something."\r\n\r\n"And you found that bust moved the next morning?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, miss, there was a queer sort of a smell in the study when I came\r\ndown and opened the windows; a bad smell it was, and I wondered what it\r\ncould be. Do you know, miss, I went a long time ago to the Zoo in London\r\nwith my cousin Thomas Barker, one afternoon that I had off, when I was\r\nat Mrs. Prince\'s in Stanhope Gate, and we went into the snake-house to\r\nsee the snakes, and it was just the same sort of a smell, very sick it\r\nmade me feel, I remember, and I got Barker to take me out. And it was\r\njust the same kind of a smell in the study, as I was saying, and I was\r\nwondering what it could be from, when I see that bust with Pitt cut in\r\nit standing on the master\'s desk, and I thought to myself, now who has\r\ndone that, and how have they done it? And when I came to dust the\r\nthings, I looked at the bust, and I saw a great mark on it where the\r\ndust was gone, for I don\'t think it can have been touched with a duster\r\nfor years and years, and it wasn\'t like finger-marks, but a large patch\r\nlike, broad and spread out. So I passed my hand over it, without\r\nthinking what I was doing, and where that patch was it was all sticky\r\nand slimy, as if a snail had crawled over it. Very strange, isn\'t it,\r\nmiss? and I wonder who can have done it, and how that mess was made."\r\n\r\nThe well-meant gabble of the servant touched me to the quick. I lay down\r\nupon my bed, and bit my lip that I should not cry out loud in the sharp\r\nanguish of my terror and bewilderment. Indeed, I was almost mad with\r\ndread; I believe that if it had been daylight I should have fled hot\r\nfoot, forgetting all courage and all the debt of gratitude that was due\r\nto Professor Gregg, not caring whether my fate were that I must starve\r\nslowly so long as I might escape from the net of blind and panic fear\r\nthat every day seemed to draw a little closer round me. If I knew, I\r\nthought, if I knew what there were to dread, I could guard against it;\r\nbut here, in this lonely house, shut in on all sides by the olden woods\r\nand the vaulted hills, terror seems to spring inconsequent from every\r\ncovert, and the flesh is aghast at the half-heard murmurs of horrible\r\nthings. All in vain I strove to summon scepticism to my aid, and\r\nendeavored by cool common-sense to buttress my belief in a world of\r\nnatural order, for the air that blew in at the open window was a mystic\r\nbreath, and in the darkness I felt the silence go heavy and sorrowful\r\nas a mass of requiem, and I conjured images of strange shapes gathering\r\nfast amidst the reeds, beside the wash of the river.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, from the moment that I set foot in the breakfast-room I\r\nfelt that the unknown plot was drawing to a crisis; the professor\'s face\r\nwas firm and set, and he seemed hardly to hear our voices when we spoke.\r\n\r\n"I am going out for rather a long walk," he said, when the meal was\r\nover. "You mustn\'t be expecting me, now, or thinking anything has\r\nhappened if I don\'t turn up to dinner. I have been getting stupid\r\nlately, and I dare say a miniature walking tour will do me good. Perhaps\r\nI may even spend the night in some little inn, if I find any place that\r\nlooks clean and comfortable."\r\n\r\nI heard this, and knew by my experience of Professor Gregg\'s manner that\r\nit was no ordinary business or pleasure that impelled him. I knew not,\r\nnor even remotely guessed, where he was bound, nor had I the vaguest\r\nnotion of his errand, but all the fear of the night before returned; and\r\nas he stood, smiling, on the terrace, ready to set out, I implored him\r\nto stay, and to forget all his dreams of the undiscovered continent.\r\n\r\n"No, no, Miss Lally," he replied, still smiling, "it\'s too late now.\r\n_Vestigia nulla retrorsum_, you know, is the device of all true\r\nexplorers, though I hope it won\'t be literally true in my ease. But,\r\nindeed, you are wrong to alarm yourself so; I look upon my little\r\nexpedition as quite commonplace; no more exciting than a day with the\r\ngeological hammers. There is a risk, of course, but so there is on the\r\ncommonest excursion. I can afford to be jaunty; I am doing nothing so\r\nhazardous as \'Arry does a hundred times over in the course of every Bank\r\nHoliday. Well, then, you must look more cheerfully; and so good-by till\r\nto-morrow at latest."\r\n\r\nHe walked briskly up the road, and I saw him open the gate that marks\r\nthe entrance of the wood, and then he vanished in the gloom of the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nAll the day passed heavily with a strange darkness in the air, and again\r\nI felt as if imprisoned amidst the ancient woods, shut in an olden land\r\nof mystery and dread, and as if all was long ago and forgotten by the\r\nliving outside. I hoped and dreaded, and when the dinner-hour came, I\r\nwaited expecting to hear the professor\'s step in the hall, and his voice\r\nexulting at I knew not what triumph. I composed my face to welcome him\r\ngladly, but the night descended dark, and he did not come.\r\n\r\nIn the morning when the maid knocked at my door, I called out to her,\r\nand asked if her master had returned; and when she replied that his\r\nbedroom stood open and empty, I felt the cold clasp of despair. Still, I\r\nfancied he might have discovered genial company, and would return for\r\nluncheon, or perhaps in the afternoon, and I took the children for a\r\nwalk in the forest, and tried my best to play and laugh with them, and\r\nto shut out the thoughts of mystery and veiled terror. Hour after hour I\r\nwaited, and my thoughts grew darker; again the night came and found me\r\nwatching, and at last, as I was making much ado to finish my dinner, I\r\nheard steps outside and the sound of a man\'s voice.\r\n\r\nThe maid came in and looked oddly at me.\r\n\r\n"Please, miss," she began, "Mr. Morgan the gardener wants to speak to\r\nyou for a minute, if you didn\'t mind."\r\n\r\n"Show him in, please," I answered, and I set my lips tight.\r\n\r\nThe old man came slowly into the room, and the servant shut the door\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\n"Sit down, Mr. Morgan," I said; "what is it that you want to say to me?"\r\n\r\n"Well, miss, Mr. Gregg he gave me something for you yesterday morning,\r\njust before he went off; and he told me particular not to hand it up\r\nbefore eight o\'clock this evening exactly, if so be as he wasn\'t back\r\nagain home before, and if he should come home before I was just to\r\nreturn it to him in his own hands. So, you see, as Mr. Gregg isn\'t here\r\nyet, I suppose I\'d better give you the parcel directly."\r\n\r\nHe pulled out something from his pocket, and gave it to me, half rising.\r\nI took it silently, and seeing that Morgan seemed doubtful as to what he\r\nwas to do next, I thanked him and bade him good-night, and he went out.\r\nI was left alone in the room with the parcel in my hand,--a paper parcel\r\nneatly sealed and directed to me, with the instructions Morgan had\r\nquoted all written in the professor\'s large loose hand. I broke the\r\nseals with a choking at my heart, and found an envelope inside,\r\naddressed also, but open, and I took the letter out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"MY DEAR MISS LALLY," it began, "To quote the old logic manual, the case\r\nof your reading this note is a case of my having made a blunder of some\r\nsort, and, I am afraid, a blunder that turns these lines into a\r\nfarewell. It is practically certain that neither you nor anyone else\r\nwill ever see me again. I have made my will with provision for this\r\neventuality, and I hope you will consent to accept the small remembrance\r\naddressed to you, and my sincere thanks for the way in which you joined\r\nyour fortunes to mine. The fate which has come upon me is desperate and\r\nterrible beyond the remotest dreams of man; but this fate you have a\r\nright to know--if you please. If you look in the left-hand drawer of my\r\ndressing-table, you will find the key of the escritoire, properly\r\nlabelled. In the well of the escritoire is a large envelope sealed and\r\naddressed to your name. I advise you to throw it forthwith into the\r\nfire; you will sleep better of nights if you do so. But if you must know\r\nthe history of what has happened, it is all written down for you to\r\nread."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe signature was firmly written below, and again I turned the page and\r\nread out the words one by one, aghast and white to the lips, my hands\r\ncold as ice, and sickness choking me. The dead silence of the room, and\r\nthe thought of the dark woods and hills closing me in on every side,\r\noppressed me, helpless and without capacity, and not knowing where to\r\nturn for counsel. At last I resolved that though knowledge should haunt\r\nmy whole life and all the days to come, I must know the meaning of the\r\nstrange terrors that had so long tormented me, rising gray, dim, and\r\nawful, like the shadows in the wood at dusk. I carefully carried out\r\nProfessor Gregg\'s directions, and not without reluctance broke the seal\r\nof the envelope, and spread out his manuscript before me. That\r\nmanuscript I always carry with me, and I see that I cannot deny your\r\nunspoken request to read it. This, then, was what I read that night,\r\nsitting at the desk, with a shaded lamp beside me.\r\n\r\nThe young lady who called herself Miss Lally then proceeded to recite:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Statement of William Gregg, F.R.S., etc._\r\n\r\nIt is many years since the first glimmer of the theory which is now\r\nalmost, if not quite, reduced to fact dawned first on my mind. A\r\nsomewhat extensive course of miscellaneous and obsolete reading had done\r\na good deal to prepare the way, and, later, when I became somewhat of a\r\nspecialist and immersed myself in the studies known as ethnological, I\r\nwas now and then startled by facts that would not square with orthodox\r\nscientific opinion, and by discoveries that seemed to hint at something\r\nstill hidden for all our research. More particularly I became convinced\r\nthat much of the folk-lore of the world is but an exaggerated account of\r\nevents that really happened, and I was especially drawn to consider the\r\nstories of the fairies, the good folk of the Celtic races. Here I\r\nthought I could detect the fringe of embroidery and exaggeration, the\r\nfantastic guise, the little people dressed in green and gold sporting in\r\nthe flowers, and I thought I saw a distinct analogy between the name\r\ngiven to this race (supposed to be imaginary) and the description of\r\ntheir appearance and manners. Just as our remote ancestors called the\r\ndreaded beings "fair" and "good" precisely because they dreaded them, so\r\nthey had dressed them up in charming forms, knowing the truth to be the\r\nvery reverse. Literature, too, had gone early to work, and had lent a\r\npowerful hand in the transformation, so that the playful elves of\r\nShakespeare are already far removed from the true original, and the real\r\nhorror is disguised in a form of prankish mischief. But in the older\r\ntales, the stories that used to make men cross themselves as they sat\r\nround the burning logs, we tread a different stage; I saw a widely\r\nopposed spirit in certain histories of children and of men and women who\r\nvanished strangely from the earth. They would be seen by a peasant in\r\nthe fields walking towards some green and rounded hillock, and seen no\r\nmore on earth; and there are stories of mothers who have left a child\r\nquietly sleeping with the cottage door rudely barred with a piece of\r\nwood, and have returned, not to find the plump and rosy little Saxon,\r\nbut a thin and wizened creature, with sallow skin and black piercing\r\neyes, the child of another race. Then, again, there were myths darker\r\nstill; the dread of witch and wizard, the lurid evil of the Sabbath, and\r\nthe hint of demons who mingled with the daughters of men. And just as we\r\nhave turned the terrible "fair folk" into a company of benignant, if\r\nfreakish, elves, so we have hidden from us the black foulness of the\r\nwitch and her companions under a popular _diablerie_ of old women and\r\nbroomsticks and a comic cat with tail on end. So the Greeks called the\r\nhideous furies benevolent ladies, and thus the northern nations have\r\nfollowed their example. I pursued my investigations, stealing odd hours\r\nfrom other and more imperative labors, and I asked myself the question:\r\nSupposing these traditions to be true, who were the demons who are\r\nreported to have attended the Sabbaths? I need not say that I laid aside\r\nwhat I may call the supernatural hypothesis of the middle ages, and came\r\nto the conclusion that fairies and devils were of one and the same race\r\nand origin; invention, no doubt, and the Gothic fancy of old days had\r\ndone much in the way of exaggeration and distortion; yet I firmly\r\nbelieved that beneath all this imagery there was a black background of\r\ntruth. As for some of the alleged wonders, I hesitated. While I should\r\nbe very loth to receive any one specific instance of modern spiritualism\r\nas containing even a grain of the genuine, yet I was not wholly prepared\r\nto deny that human flesh may now and then, once perhaps in ten million\r\ncases, be the veil of powers which seem magical to us; powers which, so\r\nfar from proceeding from the heights and leading men thither, are in\r\nreality survivals from the depths of being. The amoeba and the snail\r\nhave powers which we do not possess; and I thought it possible that the\r\ntheory of reversion might explain many things which seem wholly\r\ninexplicable. Thus stood my position; I saw good reason to believe that\r\nmuch of the tradition, a vast deal of the earliest and uncorrupted\r\ntradition of the so-called fairies, represented solid fact, and I\r\nthought that the purely supernatural element in these traditions, was to\r\nbe accounted for on the hypothesis that a race which had fallen out of\r\nthe grand march of evolution might have retained, as a survival, certain\r\npowers which would be to us wholly miraculous. Such was my theory as it\r\nstood conceived in my mind; and working with, this in view, I seemed to\r\ngather confirmation from every side, from the spoils of a tumulus or a\r\nbarrow, from a local paper reporting an antiquarian meeting in the\r\ncountry, and from general literature of all kinds. Amongst other\r\ninstances, I remember being struck by the phrase "articulate-speaking\r\nmen" in Homer, as if the writer knew or had heard of men whose speech\r\nwas so rude that it could hardly be termed articulate; and on my\r\nhypothesis of a race who had lagged far behind the rest, I could easily\r\nconceive that such a folk would speak a jargon but little removed from\r\nthe inarticulate noises of brute-beasts.\r\n\r\nThus I stood, satisfied that my conjecture was at all events not far\r\nremoved from fact, when a chance paragraph in a small country print one\r\nday arrested my attention. It was a short account of what was to all\r\nappearance the usual sordid tragedy of the village; a young girl\r\nunaccountably missing, and evil rumor blatant and busy with her\r\nreputation. Yet I could read between the lines that all this scandal was\r\npurely hypothetical, and in all probability invented to account for what\r\nwas in any other manner unaccountable. A flight to London or Liverpool,\r\nor an undiscovered body lying with a weight about its neck in the foul\r\ndepths of a woodland pool, of perhaps murder,--such were the theories of\r\nthe wretched girl\'s neighbors. But as I idly scanned the paragraph, a\r\nflash of thought passed through me with the violence of an electric\r\nshock: What if the obscure and horrible race of the hills still\r\nsurvived, still remained haunting wild places, and barren hills, and now\r\nand then repeating the evil of Gothic legend, unchanged and\r\nunchangeable as the Turanian Shelta, or the Basques of Spain. I have\r\nsaid that the thought came with violence; and indeed I drew in my breath\r\nsharply, and clung with both hands to my elbow-chair, in a strange\r\nconfusion of horror and elation. It was as if one of my _confreres_ of\r\nphysical science, roaming in a quiet English wood, had been suddenly\r\nstricken aghast by the presence of the slimy and loathsome terror of the\r\nichthyosaurus, the original of the stories of the awful worms killed by\r\nvalorous knights, or had seen the sun darkened by the pterodactyl, the\r\ndragon of tradition. Yet as a resolute explorer of knowledge, the\r\nthought of such a discovery threw me into a passion of joy, and I cut\r\nout the slip from the paper, and put it in a drawer in my old bureau,\r\nresolved that it should be but the first piece in a collection of the\r\nstrangest significance. I sat long that evening dreaming of the\r\nconclusions I should establish, nor did cooler reflection at first dash\r\nmy confidence. Yet as I began to put the case fairly, I saw that I might\r\nbe building on an unstable foundation; the facts might possibly be in\r\naccordance with local opinion; and I regarded the affair with a mood of\r\nsome reserve. Yet I resolved to remain perched on the look-out, and I\r\nhugged to myself the thought that I alone was watching and wakeful,\r\nwhile the great crowd of thinkers and searchers stood heedless and\r\nindifferent, perhaps letting the most prerogative facts pass by\r\nunnoticed.\r\n\r\nSeveral years elapsed before I was enabled to add to the contents of the\r\ndrawer; and the second find was in reality not a valuable one, for it\r\nwas a mere repetition of the first, with only the variation of another\r\nand distant locality. Yet I gained something; for in the second case, as\r\nin the first, the tragedy took place in a desolate and lonely country,\r\nand so far my theory seemed justified. But the third piece was to me far\r\nmore decisive. Again, amongst outland hills, far even from a main road\r\nof traffic, an old man was found done to death, and the instrument of\r\nexecution was left beside him. Here, indeed, there was rumor and\r\nconjecture, for the deadly tool was a primitive stone axe, bound by gut\r\nto the wooden handle, and surmises the most extravagant and improbable\r\nwere indulged in. Yet, as I thought with a kind of glee, the wildest\r\nconjectures went far astray; and I took the pains to enter into\r\ncorrespondence with the local doctor, who was called at the inquest. He,\r\na man of some acuteness, was dumfoundered. "It will not do to speak of\r\nthese things in country places, he wrote to me; but, frankly, Professor\r\nGregg, there is some hideous mystery here. I have obtained possession of\r\nthe stone axe, and have been so curious as to test its powers. I took it\r\ninto the back-garden of my house one Sunday afternoon when my family and\r\nthe servants were all out, and there, sheltered by the poplar hedges, I\r\nmade my experiments. I found the thing utterly unmanageable. Whether\r\nthere is some peculiar balance, some nice adjustment of weights, which\r\nrequire incessant practice, or whether an effectual blow can be struck\r\nonly by a certain trick of the muscles, I do not know; but I assure you\r\nthat I went into the house with but a sorry opinion of my athletic\r\ncapacities. It was like an inexperienced man trying \'putting the\r\nhammer;\' the force exerted seemed to return on oneself, and I found\r\nmyself hurled backwards with violence, while the axe fell harmless to\r\nthe ground. On another occasion I tried the experiment with a clever\r\nwoodman of the place; but this man, who had handled his axe for forty\r\nyears, could do nothing with the stone implement, and missed every\r\nstroke most ludicrously. In short, if it were not so supremely absurd, I\r\nshould say that for four thousand years no one on earth could have\r\nstruck an effective blow with the tool that undoubtedly was used to\r\nmurder the old man." This, as may be imagined, was to me rare news; and\r\nafterwards, when I heard the whole story, and learned that the\r\nunfortunate old man had babbled tales of what might be seen at night on\r\na certain wild hillside, hinting at unheard-of wonders, and that he had\r\nbeen found cold one morning on the very hill in question, my exultation\r\nwas extreme, for I felt I was leaving conjecture far behind me. But the\r\nnext step was of still greater importance. I had possessed for many\r\nyears an extraordinary stone seal,--a piece of dull black stone, two\r\ninches long from the handle to the stamp, and the stamping end a rough\r\nhexagon an inch and a quarter in diameter. Altogether, it presented the\r\nappearance of an enlarged tobacco-stopper of an old-fashioned make. It\r\nhad been sent to me by an agent in the East, who informed me that it had\r\nbeen found near the site of the ancient Babylon. But the characters\r\nengraved on the seal were to me an intolerable puzzle. Somewhat of the\r\ncuneiform pattern, there were yet striking differences, which I\r\ndetected at the first glance, and all efforts to read the inscription on\r\nthe hypothesis that the rules for deciphering the arrow-headed writing\r\nwould apply proved futile. A riddle such as this stung my pride, and at\r\nodd moments I would take the Black Seal out of the cabinet, and\r\nscrutinize it with so much idle perseverance that every letter was\r\nfamiliar to my mind, and I could have drawn the inscription from memory\r\nwithout the slightest error. Judge then of my surprise, when I one day\r\nreceived from a correspondent in the west of England a letter and an\r\nenclosure that positively left me thunderstruck. I saw carefully traced\r\non a large piece of paper the very characters of the Black Seal, without\r\nalteration of any kind, and above the inscription my friend had written:\r\n_Inscription found on a limestone rock on the Grey Hills, Monmouthshire.\r\nDone in some red earth and quite recent_. I turned to the letter. My\r\nfriend wrote: "I send you the enclosed inscription with all due reserve.\r\nA shepherd who passed by the stone a week ago swears that there was then\r\nno mark of any kind. The characters, as I have noted, are formed by\r\ndrawing some red earth over the stone, and are of an average height of\r\none inch. They look to me like a kind of cuneiform character, a good\r\ndeal altered, but this of course is impossible. It may be either a hoax\r\nor more probably some scribble of the gypsies, who are plentiful enough\r\nin this wild country. They have, as you are aware, many hieroglyphics\r\nwhich they use in communicating with one another. I happened to visit\r\nthe stone in question two days ago in connection with a rather painful\r\nincident which has occurred here."\r\n\r\nAs may be supposed, I wrote immediately to my friend, thanking him for\r\nthe copy of the inscription, and asking him in a casual manner, the\r\nhistory of the incident he mentioned. To be brief, I heard that a woman\r\nnamed Cradock, who had lost her husband a day before, had set out to\r\ncommunicate the sad news to a cousin who lived some five miles away. She\r\ntook a short cut which led by the Gray Hills. Mrs. Cradock, who was then\r\nquite a young woman, never arrived at her relative\'s house. Late that\r\nnight a farmer who had lost a couple of sheep, supposed to have wandered\r\nfrom the flock, was walking over the Gray Hills, with a lantern and his\r\ndog. His attention was attracted by a noise, which he described as a\r\nkind of wailing, mournful and pitiable to hear; and, guided by the\r\nsound, he found the unfortunate Mrs. Cradock crouched on the ground by\r\nthe limestone rock, swaying her body to and fro, and lamenting and\r\ncrying in so heart-rending a manner that the farmer was, as he says, at\r\nfirst obliged to stop his ears, or he would have run away. The woman\r\nallowed herself to be taken home, and a neighbor came to see to her\r\nnecessities. All the night she never ceased her crying, mixing her\r\nlament with words of some unintelligible jargon, and when the doctor\r\narrived he pronounced her insane. She lay on her bed for a week, now\r\nwailing, as people said, like one lost and damned for eternity, and now\r\nsunk in a heavy coma; it was thought that grief at the loss of her\r\nhusband had unsettled her mind, and the medical man did not at one time\r\nexpect her to live. I need not say that I was deeply interested in this\r\nstory, and I made my friend write to me at intervals with all the\r\nparticulars of the case. I heard then that in the course of six weeks\r\nthe woman gradually recovered the use of her faculties and some months\r\nlater she gave birth to a son, christened Jervase, who unhappily proved\r\nto be of weak intellect. Such were the facts known to the village; but\r\nto me while I whitened at the suggested thought of the hideous\r\nenormities that had doubtless been committed, all this was nothing short\r\nof conviction, and I incautiously hazarded a hint of something like the\r\ntruth to some scientific friends. The moment the words had left my lips\r\nI bitterly regretted having spoken, and thus given away the great secret\r\nof my life, but with a good deal of relief mixed with indignation, I\r\nfound my fears altogether misplaced, for my friends ridiculed me to my\r\nface, and I was regarded as a madman; and beneath a natural anger I\r\nchuckled to myself, feeling as secure amidst these blockheads, as if I\r\nhad confided what I knew to the desert sands.\r\n\r\nBut now, knowing so much, I resolved I would know all, and I\r\nconcentrated my efforts on the task of deciphering the inscription on\r\nthe Black Seal. For many years I made this puzzle the sole object of my\r\nleisure moments; for the greater portion of my time was, of course,\r\ndevoted to other duties, and it was only now and then that I could\r\nsnatch a week of clear research. If I were to tell the full history of\r\nthis curious investigation, this statement would be wearisome in the\r\nextreme, for it would contain simply the account of long and tedious\r\nfailure. By what I knew already of ancient scripts I was well-equipped\r\nfor the chase, as I always termed it to myself. I had correspondents\r\namongst all the scientific men in Europe, and, indeed, in the world, and\r\nI could not believe that in these days any character, however ancient\r\nand however perplexed, could long resist the search-light I should bring\r\nto bear upon it. Yet, in point of fact, it was fully fourteen years\r\nbefore I succeeded. With every year my professional duties increased,\r\nand my leisure became smaller. This no doubt retarded me a good deal;\r\nand yet, when I look back on those years I am astonished at the vast\r\nscope of my investigation of the Black Seal. I made my bureau a centre,\r\nand from all the world and from all the ages I gathered transcripts of\r\nancient writing. Nothing, I resolved, should pass me unawares, and the\r\nfaintest hint should be welcomed and followed up. But as one covert\r\nafter another was tried and proved empty of result, I began in the\r\ncourse of years to despair, and to wonder whether the Black Seal were\r\nthe sole relic of some race that had vanished from the world and left no\r\nother trace of its existence,--had perished, in fine, as Atlantis is\r\nsaid to have done, in some great cataclysm, its secrets perhaps drowned\r\nbeneath the ocean or moulded into the heart of the hills. The thought\r\nchilled my warmth a little, and though I still persevered, it was no\r\nlonger with the same certainty of faith. A chance came to the rescue. I\r\nwas staying in a considerable town in the north of England, and took the\r\nopportunity of going over the very creditable museum that had for some\r\ntime been established in the place. The curator was one of my\r\ncorrespondents; and, as we were looking through one of the mineral\r\ncases, my attention was struck by a specimen, a piece of black stone\r\nsome four inches square, the appearance of which reminded me in a\r\nmeasure of the Black Seal. I took it up carelessly, and was turning it\r\nover in my hand, when I saw, to my astonishment, that the under side was\r\ninscribed. I said, quietly enough, to my friend the curator that the\r\nspecimen interested me, and that I should be much obliged if he would\r\nallow me to take it with me to my hotel for a couple of days. He, of\r\ncourse, made no objection, and I hurried to my rooms, and found that my\r\nfirst glance had not deceived me. There were two inscriptions; one in\r\nthe regular cuneiform character, another in the character of the Black\r\nSeal, and I realized that my task was accomplished. I made an exact copy\r\nof the two inscriptions; and when I got to my London study, and had the\r\nSeal before me, I was able seriously to grapple with the great problem.\r\nThe interpreting inscription on the museum specimen, though in itself\r\ncurious enough, did not bear on my quest, but the transliteration made\r\nme master of the secret of the Black Seal. Conjecture, of course, had to\r\nenter into my calculations; there was here and there uncertainty about a\r\nparticular ideograph, and one sign recurring again and again on the Seal\r\nbaffled me for many successive nights. But at last the secret stood open\r\nbefore me in plain English, and I read the key of the awful\r\ntransmutation of the hills. The last word was hardly written, when with\r\nfingers all trembling and unsteady I tore the scrap of paper into the\r\nminutest fragments, and saw them flame and blacken in the red hollow of\r\nthe fire, and then I crushed the gray films that remained into finest\r\npowder. Never since then have I written those words; never will I write\r\nthe phrases which tell me how man can be reduced to the slime from which\r\nhe came, and be forced to put on the flesh of the reptile and the snake.\r\nThere was now but one thing remaining. I knew; but I desired to see, and\r\nI was after some time able to take a house in the neighborhood of the\r\nGray Hills, and not far from the cottage where Mrs. Cradock and her son\r\nJervase resided. I need not go into a full and detailed account of the\r\napparently inexplicable events which have occurred here, where I am\r\nwriting this. I knew that I should find in Jervase Cradock something of\r\nthe blood of the "Little People," and I found later that he had more\r\nthan once encountered his kinsmen in lonely places in that lonely land.\r\nWhen I was summoned one day to the garden, and found him in a seizure\r\nspeaking or hissing the ghastly jargon of the Black Seal, I am afraid\r\nthat exultation prevailed over pity. I heard bursting from his lips the\r\nsecrets of the underworld, and the word of dread, "Ishakshar," the\r\nsignification of which I must be excused from giving.\r\n\r\nBut there is one incident I cannot pass over unnoticed. In the waste\r\nhollow of the night I awoke at the sound of those hissing syllables I\r\nknew so well; and on going to the wretched boy\'s room, I found him\r\nconvulsed and foaming at the mouth, struggling on the bed as if he\r\nstrove to escape the grasp of writhing demons. I took him down to my\r\nroom and lit the lamp, while he lay twisting on the floor, calling on\r\nthe power within his flesh to leave him. I saw his body swell and become\r\ndistended as a bladder, while the face blackened before my eyes; and\r\nthen at the crisis I did what was necessary according to the directions\r\non the Seal, and putting all scruple on one side, I became a man of\r\nscience, observant of what was passing. Yet the sight I had to witness\r\nwas horrible, almost beyond the power of human conception and the most\r\nfearful fantasy; something pushed out from the body there on the floor,\r\nand stretched forth, a slimy wavering tentacle, across the room, and\r\ngrasped the bust upon the cupboard, and laid it down on my desk.\r\n\r\nWhen it was over, and I was left to walk up and down all the rest of the\r\nnight, white and shuddering, with sweat pouring from my flesh, I vainly\r\ntried to reason with myself; I said, truly enough, that I had seen\r\nnothing really supernatural, that a snail pushing out his horns and\r\ndrawing them in was but an instance on a smaller scale of what I had\r\nwitnessed; and yet horror broke through all such reasonings and left me\r\nshattered and loathing myself for the share I had taken in the night\'s\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThere is little more to be said. I am going now to the final trial and\r\nencounter; for I have determined that there shall be nothing wanting,\r\nand I shall meet the "Little People" face to face. I shall have the\r\nBlack Seal and the knowledge of its secrets to help me, and if I\r\nunhappily do not return from my journey, there is no need to conjure up\r\nhere a picture of the awfulness of my fate.\r\n\r\nPausing a little at the end of Professor Gregg\'s statement, Miss Lally\r\ncontinued her tale in the following words:--\r\n\r\nSuch was the almost incredible story that the professor had left behind\r\nhim. When I had finished reading it, it was late at night, but the next\r\nmorning I took Morgan with me, and we proceeded to search the Gray Hills\r\nfor some trace of the lost professor. I will not weary you with a\r\ndescription of the savage desolation of that tract of country, a tract\r\nof utterest loneliness, of bare green hills dotted over with gray\r\nlimestone boulders, worn by the ravage of time into fantastic semblances\r\nof men and beasts. Finally, after many hours of weary searching, we\r\nfound what I told you--the watch and chain, the purse, and the\r\nring--wrapped in a piece of coarse parchment. When Morgan cut the gut\r\nthat bound the parcel together, and I saw the professor\'s property, I\r\nburst into tears, but the sight of the dreaded characters of the Black\r\nSeal repeated on the parchment froze me to silent horror, and I think I\r\nunderstood for the first time the awful fate that had come upon my late\r\nemployer.\r\n\r\nI have only to add that Professor Gregg\'s lawyer treated my account of\r\nwhat had happened as a fairy tale, and refused even to glance at the\r\ndocuments I laid before him. It was he who was responsible for the\r\nstatement that appeared in the public press, to the effect that\r\nProfessor Gregg had been drowned, and that his body must have been swept\r\ninto the open sea.\r\n\r\nMiss Lally stopped speaking and looked at Mr. Phillipps, with a glance\r\nof some enquiry. He, for his part, was sunken in a deep revery of\r\nthought; and when he looked up and saw the bustle of the evening\r\ngathering in the square, men and women hurrying to partake of dinner,\r\nand crowds already besetting the music-halls, all the hum and press of\r\nactual life seemed unreal and visionary, a dream in the morning after an\r\nawakening.\r\n\r\n"I thank you," he said at last, "for your most interesting story,\r\ninteresting to me, because I feel fully convinced of its exact truth."\r\n\r\n"Sir," said the lady, with some energy of indignation, "you grieve and\r\noffend me. Do you think I should waste my time and yours by concocting\r\nfictions on a bench in Leicester Square?"\r\n\r\n"Pardon me, Miss Lally, you have a little misunderstood me. Before you\r\nbegan I knew that whatever you told would be told in good faith, but\r\nyour experiences have a far higher value than that of _bona fides_. The\r\nmost extraordinary circumstances in your account are in perfect harmony\r\nwith the very latest scientific theories. Professor Lodge would, I am\r\nsure, value a communication from you extremely; I was charmed from the\r\nfirst by his daring hypothesis in explanation of the wonders of\r\nSpiritualism (so called), but your narrative puts the whole matter out\r\nof the range of mere hypothesis."\r\n\r\n"Alas, sir, all this will not help me. You forget, I have lost my\r\nbrother under the most startling and dreadful circumstances. Again, I\r\nask you, did you not see him as you came here? His black whiskers, his\r\nspectacles, his timid glance to right and left; think, do not these\r\nparticulars recall his face to your memory?"\r\n\r\n"I am sorry to say I have never seen any one of the kind," said\r\nPhillipps, who had forgotten all about the missing brother. "But let me\r\nask you a few questions. Did you notice whether Professor Gregg--"\r\n\r\n"Pardon me, sir, I have stayed too long. My employers will be expecting\r\nme. I thank you for your sympathy. Good bye."\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Phillipps had recovered from his amazement at this abrupt\r\ndeparture, Miss Lally had disappeared from his gaze, passing into the\r\ncrowd that now thronged the approaches to the Empire. He walked home in\r\na pensive frame of mind, and drank too much tea. At ten o\'clock he had\r\nmade his third brew, and had sketched out the outlines of a little work\r\nto be called _Protoplasmic Reversion_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCIDENT OF THE PRIVATE BAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Dyson often meditated at odd moments over the singular tale he had\r\nlistened to at the Cafe de la Touraine. In the first place he cherished\r\na profound conviction that the words of truth were scattered with a too\r\nniggardly and sparing hand over the agreeable history of Mr. Smith and\r\nthe Black Gulf Canyon; and, secondly, there was the undeniable fact of\r\nthe profound agitation of the narrator, and his gestures on the\r\npavement, too violent to be simulated. The idea of a man going about\r\nLondon haunted by the fear of meeting a young man with spectacles struck\r\nDyson as supremely ridiculous; he searched his memory for some precedent\r\nin romance, but without success; he paid visits at odd times to the\r\nlittle cafe, hoping to find Mr. Wilkins there; and he kept a sharp watch\r\non the great generation of the spectacled men without much doubt that he\r\nwould remember the face of the individual whom he had seen dart out of\r\nthe Aerated Bread Shop. All his peregrinations and researches, however,\r\nseemed to lead to nothing of value, and Dyson needed all his warm\r\nconviction of his innate detective powers and his strong scent for\r\nmystery to sustain him in his endeavors. In fact, he had two affairs on\r\nhand; and every day, as he passed through streets crowded or deserted,\r\nand lurked in the obscure districts, and watched at corners, he was more\r\nthan surprised to find that the affair of the gold coin persistently\r\navoided him; while the ingenious Wilkins, and the young man with\r\nspectacles whom he dreaded, seemed to have vanished from the pavements.\r\n\r\nHe was pondering these problems one evening in a house of call in the\r\nStrand, and the obstinacy with which the persons he so ardently desired\r\nto meet hung back gave the modest tankard before him an additional touch\r\nof bitter. As it happened, he was alone in his compartment, and, without\r\nthinking, he uttered aloud the burden of his meditations. "How bizarre\r\nit all is!" he said, "a man walking the pavement with the dread of a\r\ntimid-looking young man with spectacles continually hovering before his\r\neyes. And there was some tremendous feeling at work, I could swear to\r\nthat." Quick as thought, before he had finished the sentence, a head\r\npopped round the barrier, and was withdrawn again; and while Dyson was\r\nwondering what this could mean, the door of the compartment was swung\r\nopen, and a smooth, clean-shaven, and smiling gentleman entered.\r\n\r\n"You will excuse me, sir," he said politely, "for intruding on your\r\nthoughts, but you made a remark a minute ago."\r\n\r\n"I did," said Dyson; "I have been puzzling over a foolish matter, and I\r\nthought aloud. As you heard what I said, and seem interested, perhaps\r\nyou may be able to relieve my perplexity?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed. I scarcely know; it is an odd coincidence. One has to be\r\ncautions. I suppose, sir, that you would have no repulsion in assisting\r\nthe ends of justice."\r\n\r\n"Justice," replied Dyson, "is a term of such wide meaning, that I too\r\nfeel doubtful about giving an answer. But this place is not altogether\r\nfit for such a discussion; perhaps you would come to my rooms?"\r\n\r\n"You are very kind; my name is Burton, but I am sorry to say I have not\r\na card with me. Do you live near here?"\r\n\r\n"Within ten minutes\' walk."\r\n\r\nMr. Burton took out his watch and seemed to be making a rapid\r\ncalculation.\r\n\r\n"I have a train to catch," he said; "but after all, it is a late one.\r\nSo, if you don\'t mind, I think I will come with you. I am sure we should\r\nhave a little talk together. We turn up here?"\r\n\r\nThe theatres were filling as they crossed the Strand, the street seemed\r\nalive with voices, and Dyson looked fondly about him. The glittering\r\nlines of gas-lamps, with here and there the blinding radiance of an\r\nelectric light, the hansoms that flashed to and fro with ringing bells,\r\nthe laden buses, and the eager hurrying east and west of the foot\r\npassengers, made his most enchanting picture; and the graceful spire of\r\nSt. Mary le Strand, on the one hand, and the last flush of sunset on the\r\nother, were to him a cause of thanksgiving, as the gorse blossom to\r\nLinnaeus. Mr. Burton caught his look of fondness as they crossed the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n"I see you can find the picturesque in London," he said. "To me this\r\ngreat town is as I see it is to you, the study and the love of life. Yet\r\nhow few there are that can pierce the veils of apparent monotony and\r\nmeanness! I have read in a paper which is said to have the largest\r\ncirculation in the world, a comparison between the aspects of London and\r\nParis, a comparison which should be positively laureat, as the great\r\nmasterpiece of fatuous stupidity. Conceive if you can a human being of\r\nordinary intelligence preferring the Boulevards to our London streets;\r\nimagine a man calling for the wholesale destruction of our most charming\r\ncity, in order that the dull uniformity of that whited sepulchre called\r\nParis should be reproduced here in London. Is it not positively\r\nincredible?"\r\n\r\n"My dear sir," said Dyson, regarding Burton with a good deal of\r\ninterest. "I agree most heartily with your opinions, but I really cannot\r\nshare your wonder. Have you heard how much George Eliot received for\r\n\'Romola\'? Do you know what the circulation of \'Robert Elsmere\' was? Do\r\nyou read \'Tit Bits\' regularly? To me, on the contrary, it is constant\r\nmatter both for wonder and thanksgiving that London was not\r\nboulevardized twenty years ago. I praise that exquisite jagged sky line\r\nthat stands up against the pale greens and fading blues and flushing\r\nclouds of sunset, but I wonder even more than I praise. As for St. Mary\r\nle Strand, its preservation is a miracle, nothing more or less. A thing\r\nof exquisite beauty _versus_ four buses abreast! Really, the conclusion\r\nis too obvious. Didn\'t you read the letter of the man who proposed that\r\nthe whole mysterious system, the immemorial plan of computing Easter,\r\nshould, be abolished off-hand because he doesn\'t like his son having his\r\nholidays as early as March 20th? But shall we be going on?"\r\n\r\nThey had lingered at the corner of a street on the north side of the\r\nStrand, enjoying the contrasts and the glamour of the scene. Dyson\r\npointed the way with a gesture, and they strolled up the comparatively\r\ndeserted streets, slanting a little to the right, and thus arriving at\r\nDyson\'s lodging on the verge of Bloomsbury. Mr. Burton took a\r\ncomfortable armchair by the open window, while Dyson lit the candles and\r\nproduced the whiskey and soda and cigarettes.\r\n\r\n"They tell me these cigarettes are very good," he said, "but I know\r\nnothing about it myself. I hold at last that there is only one tobacco,\r\nand that is shag. I suppose I could not tempt you to try a pipeful?"\r\n\r\nMr. Burton smilingly refused the offer, and picked out a cigarette from\r\nthe box. When he had smoked it half through, he said with some\r\nhesitation:--\r\n\r\n"It is really kind of you to have me here, Mr. Dyson; the fact is that\r\nthe interests at issue are far too serious to be discussed in a bar,\r\nwhere, as you found for yourself, there may be listeners, voluntary or\r\ninvoluntary, on each side. I think the remark I heard you make was\r\nsomething about the oddity of an individual going about London in deadly\r\nfear of a young man with spectacles."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that was it."\r\n\r\n"Well, would you mind confiding to me the circumstances that gave rise\r\nto the reflection?"\r\n\r\n"Not in the least; it was like this." And he ran over in brief outline\r\nthe adventure in Oxford Street, dwelling on the violence of Mr.\r\nWilkins\'s gestures, but wholly suppressing the tale told in the cafe.\r\n"He told me he lived in constant terror of meeting this man; and I left\r\nhim when I thought he was cool enough to look after himself," said\r\nDyson, ending his narrative.\r\n\r\n"Really," said Mr. Burton. "And you actually saw this mysterious\r\nperson."\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And could you describe him?"\r\n\r\n"Well, he looked to me a youngish man, pale and nervous. He had small\r\nblack side whiskers, and wore rather large spectacles."\r\n\r\n"But this is simply marvellous! You astonish me. For I must tell you\r\nthat my interest in the matter is this. I am not in the least in terror\r\nof meeting a dark young man with spectacles, but I shrewdly suspect a\r\nperson of that description would much rather not meet me. And yet the\r\naccount you give of the man tallies exactly. A nervous glance to right\r\nand left--is it not so? And, as you observed, he wears prominent\r\nspectacles, and has small black whiskers. There cannot be surely two\r\npeople exactly identical--one a cause of terror, and the other, I should\r\nimagine, extremely anxious to get out of the way. But have you seen this\r\nman since?"\r\n\r\n"No, I have not; and I have been looking out for him pretty keenly. But,\r\nof course, he may have left London, and England too for the matter of\r\nthat."\r\n\r\nHardly, I think. Well, Mr. Dyson, it is only fair that I should explain\r\nmy story, now that I have listened, to yours. I must tell you, then,\r\nthat I am an agent for curiosities and precious things of all kinds. An\r\nodd employment, isn\'t it? Of course I wasn\'t brought up to the business;\r\nI gradually fell into it. I have always been fond of things queer and\r\nrare, and by the time I was twenty I had made half a dozen collections.\r\nIt is not generally known how often farm laborers come upon rarities;\r\nyou would be astonished if I told you what I have seen turned up by the\r\nplough. I lived in the country in those days, and I used to buy anything\r\nthe men on the farms brought me; and I had the queerest set of rubbish,\r\nas my friends called my collection. But that\'s how I got the scent of\r\nthe business, which means everything; and, later on, it struck me that I\r\nmight very well turn my knowledge to account and add to my income. Since\r\nthose early days I have been in most quarters of the world, and some\r\nvery valuable things have passed through my hands, and I have had to\r\nengage in difficult and delicate negotiations. You have possibly heard\r\nof the Khan opal--called in the East \'The Stone of a Thousand and One\r\nColors\'? Well, perhaps the conquest of that stone was my greatest\r\nachievement. I call it myself the stone of the thousand and one lies,\r\nfor I assure you that I had to invent a cycle of folk-lore before the\r\nRajah who owned it would consent to sell the thing. I subsidized\r\nwandering story-tellers, who told tales in which the opal played a\r\nfrightful part; I hired a holy man, a great ascetic, to prophesy against\r\nthe thing in the language of Eastern symbolism; in short, I frightened\r\nthe Rajah out of his wits. So you see there is room for diplomacy in\r\nthe traffic I am engaged in. I have to be ever on my guard, and I have\r\noften been sensible that unless I watched every step and weighed every\r\nword my life would not last me much longer. Last April I became aware of\r\nthe existence of a highly valuable antique gem. It was in Southern\r\nItaly, and in the possession of persons who were ignorant of its real\r\nvalue. It has always been my experience that it is precisely the\r\nignorant who are most difficult to deal with. I have met farmers who\r\nwere under the impression that a shilling of George I. was a find of\r\nalmost incalculable value; and all the defeats I have sustained have\r\nbeen at the hands of people of this description. Reflecting on these\r\nfacts, I saw that the acquisition of the gem I have mentioned would be\r\nan affair demanding the nicest diplomacy; I might possibly have got it\r\nby offering a sum approaching its real value, but I need not point out\r\nto you that such a proceeding would be most unbusinesslike. Indeed, I\r\ndoubt whether it would have been successful, for the cupidity of such\r\npersons is aroused by a sum which seems enormous, and the low cunning\r\nwhich serves them in place of intelligence immediately suggests that the\r\nobject for which such an amount is offered must be worth at least\r\ndouble. Of course, when it is a matter of an ordinary curiosity--an old\r\njug, a carved chest, or a queer brass lantern--one does not much care;\r\nthe cupidity of the owner defeats its object, the collector laughs, and\r\ngoes away, for he is aware that such things are by no means unique. But\r\nthis gem I fervently desired to possess; and as I did not see my way to\r\ngiving more than a hundredth part of its value, I was conscious that\r\nall my, let us say, imaginative and diplomatic powers would have to be\r\nexerted. I am sorry to say that I came to the conclusion that I could\r\nnot undertake to carry the matter through single-handed, and I\r\ndetermined to confide in my assistant, a young man named William\r\nRobbins, whom I judged to be by no means devoid of capacity. My idea was\r\nthat Robbins should get himself up as a low-class dealer in precious\r\nstones; he could patter a little Italian, and would go to the town in\r\nquestion and manage to see the gem we were after, possibly by offering\r\nsome trifling articles of jewelry for sale, but that I left to be\r\ndecided, then my work was to begin, but I will not trouble you with a\r\ntale told twice over. In due course, then, Robbins went off to Italy\r\nwith an assortment of uncut stones and a few rings, and some jewelry I\r\nbought in Birmingham, on purpose for his expedition. A week later I\r\nfollowed him, travelling leisurely, so that I was a fortnight later in\r\narriving at our common destination. There was a decent hotel in the\r\ntown, and on my inquiring of the landlord whether there were many\r\nstrangers in the place, he told me very few; he had heard there was an\r\nEnglishman staying in a small tavern, a pedlar he said, who sold\r\nbeautiful trinkets very cheaply, and wanted to buy old rubbish. For five\r\nor six days I took life leisurely, and I must say I enjoyed myself. It\r\nwas part of my plan to make the people think I was an enormously rich\r\nman; and I knew that such items as the extravagance of my meals, and the\r\nprice of every bottle of wine I drank, would not be suffered, as Sancho\r\nPanza puts it, to rot in the landlord\'s breast. At the end of the week I\r\nwas fortunate enough to make the acquaintance of Signor Melini, the\r\nowner of the gem I coveted, at the cafe, and with his ready hospitality\r\nand my geniality I was soon established as a friend of the house. On my\r\nthird or fourth visit I managed to make the Italians talk about the\r\nEnglish pedlar, who, they said, spoke a most detestable Italian. \'But\r\nthat does not matter,\' said the Signora Melini, \'for he has beautiful\r\nthings, which he sells very very cheap.\' \'I hope you may not find he has\r\ncheated you,\' I said, \'for I must tell you that English people give\r\nthese fellows a very wide berth. They usually make a great parade of the\r\ncheapness of their goods, which often turn out to be double the price of\r\nbetter articles in the shops,\' They would not hear of this, and Signora\r\nMelini insisted on showing me the three rings and the bracelet she had\r\nbought of the pedlar. She told me the price she had paid; and after\r\nscrutinizing the articles carefully, I had to confess that she had made\r\na bargain, and indeed Robbins had sold her the things at about fifty per\r\ncent below market value. I admired the trinkets as I gave them back to\r\nthe lady, and I hinted that the pedlar must be a somewhat foolish\r\nspecimen of his class. Two days later, as I was taking my vermouth at\r\nthe cafe with Signor Melini, he led the conversation back to the pedlar,\r\nand mentioned casually that he had shown the man a little curiosity, for\r\nwhich he had made rather a handsome offer. \'My dear sir,\' I said, \'I\r\nhope you will be careful. I told you that the travelling tradesman does\r\nnot bear a very high reputation in England; and notwithstanding his\r\napparent simplicity, this fellow may turn out to be an arrant cheat. May\r\nI ask you what is the nature of the curiosity you have shown him?\' He\r\ntold me it was a little thing, a pretty little stone with some figures\r\ncut on it: people said it was old. \'I should like to examine it,\' I\r\nreplied; \'as it happens I have, seen a good deal of these gems. We have\r\na fine collection of them in our museum at London.\' In due course I was\r\nshown the article, and I held the gem I so coveted between my fingers. I\r\nlooked at it coolly, and put it down carelessly on the table. \'Would you\r\nmind telling me, signor,\' I said, \'how much my fellow-countryman offered\r\nyou for this?\' \'Well,\' he said, \'my wife says the man must be mad; he\r\nsaid he would give me twenty lire for it.\'\r\n\r\n"I looked at him quietly, and took up the gem and pretended to examine\r\nit in the light more carefully; I turned it over and over, and finally\r\npulled out a magnifying glass from my pocket, and seemed to search every\r\nline in the cutting with minutest scrutiny. \'My dear sir,\' I said at\r\nlast, \'I am inclined to agree with Signora Melini. If this gem were\r\ngenuine, it would be worth some money; but as it happens to be a rather\r\nbad forgery, it is not worth twenty centesimi. It was sophisticated, I\r\nshould imagine, some time in the last century, and by a very unskilful\r\nhand.\' \'Then we had better get rid of it,\' said Melini. \'I never thought\r\nit was worth anything myself. Of course I am sorry for the pedlar, but\r\none must let a man know his own trade. I shall tell him we will take the\r\ntwenty lire.\' \'Excuse me,\' I said, \'the man wants a lesson. It would be\r\na charity to give him one. Tell him that you will not take anything\r\nunder eighty lire, and I shall be much surprised if he does not close\r\nwith you at once.\r\n\r\n"A day or two later I heard that the English pedlar had gone away, after\r\ndebasing the minds of the country people with Birmingham art jewelry;\r\nfor I admit that the gold sleeve links like kidney beans, the silver\r\nchains made apparently after the pattern of a dog-chain, and the initial\r\nbrooches, have always been heavy on my conscience. I cannot acquit\r\nmyself of having indirectly contributed to debauch the taste of a simple\r\nfolk; but I hope that the end I had in view may finally outbalance this\r\nheavy charge. Soon afterwards, I paid a farewell visit at the Melinis,\r\nand the signor informed me with an oily chuckle that the plan I had\r\nsuggested had been completely successful. I congratulated him on his\r\nbargain, and went away after expressing a wish that heaven might send\r\nmany such pedlars in his path.\r\n\r\n"Nothing of interest occurred on my return journey. I had arranged that\r\nRobbins was to meet me at a certain place on a certain day, and I went\r\nto the appointment full of the coolest confidence; the gem had been\r\nconquered, and I had only to reap the fruits of victory. I am sorry to\r\nshake that trust in our common human nature which I am sure you possess,\r\nbut I am compelled to tell you that up to the present date I have never\r\nset eyes on my man Robbins, or on the antique gem in his custody. I have\r\nfound out that he actually arrived in London, for he was seen three\r\ndays before my arrival in England by a pawnbroker of my acquaintance\r\nconsuming his favorite beverage, four ale, in the tavern where we met\r\nto-night. Since then he has not been heard of. I hope you will now\r\npardon my curiosity as to the history and adventures of dark young men\r\nwith spectacles. You will, I am sure, feel for me in my position; the\r\nsavor of life has disappeared for me; it is a bitter thought that I have\r\nrescued one of the most perfect and exquisite specimens of antique art\r\nfrom the hands of ignorant, and indeed unscrupulous persons, only to\r\ndeliver it into the keeping of a man who is evidently utterly devoid of\r\nthe very elements of commercial morality."\r\n\r\n"My dear sir," said Dyson, "you will allow me to compliment you on your\r\nstyle; your adventures have interested me exceedingly. But, forgive me,\r\nyou just now used the word morality; would not some persons take\r\nexception to your own methods of business? I can conceive, myself, flaws\r\nof a moral kind being found in the very original conception you have\r\ndescribed to me. I can imagine the Puritan shrinking in dismay from your\r\nscheme, pronouncing it unscrupulous, nay, dishonest."\r\n\r\nMr. Burton helped himself, very frankly, to some more whiskey.\r\n\r\n"Your scruples entertain me," he said. "Perhaps you have not gone very\r\ndeeply into these questions of ethics. I have been compelled to do so\r\nmyself, just as I was forced to master a simple system of book-keeping.\r\nWithout book-keeping, and still more without a system of ethics, it is\r\nimpossible to conduct a business such as mine. But I assure you that I\r\nam often profoundly saddened as I pass through the crowded streets and\r\nwatch the world at work by the thought of how few amongst all these\r\nhurrying individuals, black hatted, well dressed, educated we may\r\npresume sufficiently,--how few amongst them have any reasoned system of\r\nmorality. Even you have not weighed the question; although you study\r\nlife and affairs, and to a certain extent penetrate the veils and masks\r\nof the comedy of man, even you judge by empty conventions, and the false\r\nmoney which is allowed to pass current as sterling coin. Allow me to\r\nplay the part of Socrates; I shall teach you nothing that you do not\r\nknow. I shall merely lay aside the wrappings of prejudice and bad logic,\r\nand show you the real image which you possess in your soul. Come then.\r\nDo you allow that happiness is anything?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said Dyson.\r\n\r\n"And happiness is desirable or undesirable?"\r\n\r\n"Desirable of course."\r\n\r\n"And what shall we call the man who gives happiness? Is he not a\r\nphilanthropist?"\r\n\r\n"I think so."\r\n\r\n"And such a person is praiseworthy, and the more praiseworthy in the\r\nproportion of the persons whom he makes happy?"\r\n\r\n"By all means."\r\n\r\n"So that he who makes a whole nation happy, is praiseworthy in the\r\nextreme, and the action by which he gives happiness is the highest\r\nvirtue?"\r\n\r\n"It appears so, O Burton," said Dyson, who found something very\r\nexquisite in the character of his visitor.\r\n\r\n"Quite so; you find the several conclusions inevitable. Well, apply them\r\nto the story I have told, you. I conferred happiness on myself by\r\nobtaining (as I thought) possession of the gem; I conferred happiness on\r\nthe Melinis by getting them eighty lire instead of an object for which\r\nthey had not the slightest value, and I intended to confer happiness on\r\nthe whole British nation by selling the thing to the British Museum, to\r\nsay nothing of the happiness a profit of about nine thousand per cent\r\nwould have conferred on me. I assure you I regard Robbins as an\r\ninterferer with the cosmos and fair order of things. But that is\r\nnothing; you perceive that I am an apostle of the very highest morality;\r\nyou have been forced to yield to argument."\r\n\r\n"There certainly seems a great deal in what you advance," said Dyson. "I\r\nadmit that I am a mere amateur of ethics, while you, as you say, have\r\nbrought the most acute scrutiny to bear on these perplexed and doubtful\r\nquestions. I can well understand your anxiety to meet the fallacious\r\nRobbins, and I congratulate myself on the chance which has made us\r\nacquainted. But you will pardon my seeming inhospitality, I see it is\r\nhalf past eleven, and I think you mentioned a train."\r\n\r\n"A thousand thanks, Mr. Dyson, I have just time, I see. I will look you\r\nup some evening if I may. Good-night."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DECORATIVE IMAGINATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of a few weeks Dyson became accustomed, to the constant\r\nincursions of the ingenious Mr. Burton, who showed himself ready to drop\r\nin at all hours, not averse to refreshment, and a profound guide in the\r\ncomplicated questions of life. His visits at once terrified and\r\ndelighted Dyson, who could no longer seat himself at his bureau secure\r\nfrom interruption while he embarked on literary undertakings, each one\r\nof which was to be a masterpiece. On the other hand, it was a vivid\r\npleasure to be confronted with views so highly original; and if here and\r\nthere Mr. Burton\'s reasonings seemed tinged with fallacy, yet Dyson\r\nfreely yielded to the joy of strangeness, and never failed to give his\r\nvisitor a frank and hearty welcome. Mr. Burton\'s first inquiry was\r\nalways after the unprincipled Robbins, and he seemed to feel the stings\r\nof disappointment when Dyson told him that he had failed to meet this\r\noutrage on all morality, as Burton styled him, vowing that sooner or\r\nlater he would take vengeance on such a shameless betrayal of trust.\r\n\r\nOne evening they had sat together for some time discussing the\r\npossibility of laying down for this present generation and our modern\r\nand intensely complicated order of society, some rules of social\r\ndiplomacy, such as Lord Bacon gave to the courtiers of King James I. "It\r\nis a book to make," said Mr. Burton, "but who is there capable of making\r\nit? I tell you people are longing for such a book; it would bring\r\nfortune to its publisher. Bacon\'s Essays are exquisite, but they have\r\nnow no practical application; the modern strategist can find but little\r\nuse in a treatise \'De Re Militari,\' written by a Florentine in the\r\nfifteenth century. Scarcely more dissimilar are the social conditions of\r\nBacon\'s time and our own; the rules that he lays down so exquisitely for\r\nthe courtier and diplomatist of James the First\'s age will avail us\r\nlittle in the rough-and-tumble struggle of to-day. Life, I am afraid,\r\nhas deteriorated; it gives little play for fine strokes such as formerly\r\nadvanced men in the state. Except in such businesses as mine, where a\r\nchance does occur now and then, it has all become, as I said, an affair\r\nof rough and tumble; men still desire to attain, it is true, but what is\r\ntheir _moyen de parvenir_? A mere imitation, and not a gracious one, of\r\nthe arts of the soap-vender and the proprietor of baking powder. When I\r\nthink of these things, my dear Dyson, I confess that I am tempted to\r\ndespair of my century."\r\n\r\n"You are too pessimistic, my dear fellow; you set up too high a\r\nstandard. Certainly, I agree with you that the times are decadent in\r\nmany ways. I admit a general appearance of squalor; it needs much\r\nphilosophy to extract the wonderful and the beautiful from the Cromwell\r\nRoad or the Nonconformist conscience. Australian wines of fine Burgundy\r\ncharacter, the novels alike of the old women and the new women, popular\r\njournalism,--these things indeed make for depression. Yet we have our\r\nadvantages. Before us is unfolded the greatest spectacle the world has\r\never seen,--the mystery of the innumerable unending streets, the strange\r\nadventures that must infallibly arise from so complicated a press of\r\ninterests. Nay, I will say that he who has stood in the ways of a suburb\r\nand has seen them stretch before him all shining, void, and desolate at\r\nnoonday, has not lived in vain. Such a sight is in reality more\r\nwonderful than any perspective of Bagdad or Grand Cairo. And, to set on\r\none side the entertaining history of the gem which you told me, surely\r\nyou must have had many singular adventures in your own career?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not so many as you would think; a good deal--the larger\r\npart--of my business has been as commonplace as linen-drapery. But of\r\ncourse things happen now and then. It is ten years since I have\r\nestablished my agency, and I suppose that a house and estate agent who\r\nhad been in trade for an equal time could tell you some queer stories.\r\nBut I must give you a sample of my experiences some night.\r\n\r\n"Why not to-night?" said Dyson. "This evening seems to me admirably\r\nadapted for an odd chapter. Look out into the street; you can catch a\r\nview of it, if you crane your neck from that chair of yours. Is it not\r\ncharming? The double row of lamps growing closer in the distance, the\r\nhazy outline of the plane-tree in the square, and the lights of the\r\nhansoms swimming to and fro, gliding and vanishing; and above, the sky\r\nall clear and blue and shining. Come, let us have one of your _cent\r\nnouvelles nouvelles_."\r\n\r\n"My dear Dyson, I am delighted to amuse you." With these words Mr.\r\nBurton prefaced the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL OF THE IRON MAID.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think the most extraordinary event which I can recall took place about\r\nfive years ago. I was then still feeling my way; I had declared for\r\nbusiness, and attended regularly at my office, but I had not succeeded\r\nin establishing a really profitable connection, and consequently I had a\r\ngood deal of leisure time on my hands. I have never thought fit to\r\ntrouble you with the details of my private life; they would be entirely\r\ndevoid of interest. I must briefly say, however, that I had a numerous\r\ncircle of acquaintance, and was never at a loss as to how to spend my\r\nevenings. I was so fortunate as to have friends in most of the ranks of\r\nthe social order; there is nothing so unfortunate, to my mind, as a\r\nspecialized circle, wherein a certain round of ideas is continually\r\ntraversed and retraversed. I have always tried to find out new types and\r\npersons whose brains contained something fresh to me; one may chance to\r\ngain information even from the conversation of city men on an omnibus.\r\nAmongst my acquaintance I knew a young doctor who lived in a far\r\noutlying suburb, and I used often to brave the intolerably slow railway\r\njourney, to have the pleasure of listening to his talk. One night we\r\nconversed so eagerly together over our pipes and whiskey that the clock\r\npassed unnoticed, and when I glanced up I realized with a shock that I\r\nhad just five minutes in which to catch the last tram. I made a dash for\r\nmy hat and stick, and jumped out of the house and down the steps, and\r\ntore at full speed up the street. It was no good, however; there was a\r\nshriek of the engine whistle, and I stood there at the station door and\r\nsaw far on the long dark line of the embankment a red light shine and\r\nvanish, and a porter came down and shut the door with a bang.\r\n\r\n"How far to London?" I asked him.\r\n\r\n"A good nine miles to Waterloo Bridge;" and with that he went off.\r\n\r\nBefore me was the long suburban street, its dreary distance marked by\r\nrows of twinkling lamps, and the air was poisoned by the faint sickly\r\nsmell of burning bricks; it was not a cheerful prospect by any means,\r\nand I had to walk through nine miles of such streets, deserted as those\r\nof Pompeii. I knew pretty well what direction to take; so I set out\r\nwearily, looking at the stretch of lamps vanishing in perspective; and\r\nas I walked, street after street branched off to right and left,--some\r\nfar reaching to distances that seemed endless, communicating with, other\r\nsystems of thoroughfare; and some mere protoplasmic streets, beginning\r\nin orderly fashion with serried two-storied houses, and ending suddenly\r\nin waste, and pits, and rubbish heaps, and fields whence the magic had\r\ndeparted. I have spoken of systems of thoroughfare, and I assure you\r\nthat, walking alone through these silent places, I felt phantasy growing\r\non me, and some glamour of the infinite. There was here. I felt, an\r\nimmensity as in the outer void, of the universe. I passed from unknown\r\nto unknown, my way marked by lamps like stars, and on either band was an\r\nunknown world where myriads of men dwelt and slept, street leading into\r\nstreet, as it seemed to world\'s end. At first the road by which I was\r\ntravelling was lined with houses of unutterable monotony,--a wall of\r\ngray brick pierced by two stories of windows, drawn close to the very\r\npavement. But by degrees I noticed an improvement: there were gardens,\r\nand these grew larger. The suburban builder began to allow himself a\r\nwider scope; and for a certain distance each flight of steps was guarded\r\nby twin lions of plaster, and scents of flowers prevailed over the fume\r\nof heated bricks. The road began to climb a hill, and, looking up a side\r\nstreet, I saw the half moon rise over plane-trees, and there on the\r\nother side was as if a white cloud had fallen, and the air around it was\r\nsweetened as with incense; it was a may-tree in full bloom. I pressed on\r\nstubbornly, listening for the wheels and the clatter of some belated\r\nhansom; but into that land of men who go to the city in the morning and\r\nreturn in the evening, the hansom rarely enters, and I had resigned\r\nmyself once more to the walk, when I suddenly became aware that some one\r\nwas advancing to meet me along the sidewalk. The man was strolling\r\nrather aimlessly; and though the time and the place would have allowed\r\nan unconventional style of dress, he was vested in the ordinary frock\r\ncoat, black tie, and silk hat of civilization. We met each other under\r\nthe lamp, and, as often happens in this great town, two casual\r\npassengers brought face to face found, each in the other an\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Mathias, I think?" I said.\r\n\r\n"Quite so. And you are Frank Burton. You know you are a man with a\r\nChristian name, so I won\'t apologize for my familiarity. But may I ask\r\nwhere you are going?"\r\n\r\nI explained the situation to him, saying I had traversed a region as\r\nunknown to me as the darkest recesses of Africa. "I think I have only\r\nabout five miles farther," I concluded.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense; you must come home with me. My house is close by; in fact, I\r\nwas just taking my evening walk when we met. Come along; I dare say you\r\nwill find a makeshift bed easier than a five-mile walk."\r\n\r\nI let him take my arm and lead me along, though I was a good deal\r\nsurprised at so much geniality from a man who was, after all, a mere\r\ncasual club acquaintance. I suppose I had not spoken to Mr. Mathias\r\nhalf-a-dozen times; he was a man who would sit silent in an armchair\r\nfor hours, neither reading nor smoking, but now and again moistening his\r\nlips with his tongue and smiling queerly to himself. I confess he had\r\nnever attracted me, and on the whole I should have preferred to continue\r\nmy walk. But he took my arm and led me up a side street, and stopped at\r\na door in a high wall. We passed through the still moonlit garden,\r\nbeneath the black shadow of an old cedar, and into an old red brick\r\nhouse with many gables. I was tired enough, and I sighed with relief as\r\nI let myself fall into a great leather armchair. You know the infernal\r\ngrit with which they strew the sidewalk in those suburban districts; it\r\nmakes walking a penance, and I felt my four-mile tramp had made me more\r\nweary than ten miles on an honest country road. I looked about the room\r\nwith some curiosity. There was a shaded lamp which threw a circle of\r\nbrilliant light on a heap of papers lying on an old brass-bound\r\nsecretaire of the last century; but the room was all vague and shadowy,\r\nand I could only see that it was long and low, and that it was filled\r\nwith indistinct objects which might be furniture. Mr. Mathias sat down\r\nin a second armchair, and looked about him with that odd smile of his.\r\nHe was a queer-looking man, clean-shaven, and white to the lips. I\r\nshould think his age was something between fifty and sixty.\r\n\r\n"Now I have got you here," he began, "I must inflict my hobby on you.\r\nYou knew I was a collector? Oh, yes, I have devoted many years to\r\ncollecting curiosities, which I think are really curious. But we must\r\nhave a better light."\r\n\r\nHe advanced into the middle of the room, and lit a lamp which hung from\r\nthe ceiling; and as the bright light flashed round the wick, from every\r\ncorner and space there seemed to start a horror. Great wooden frames\r\nwith complicated apparatus of ropes and pulleys stood against the wall;\r\na wheel of strange shape had a place beside a thing that looked like a\r\ngigantic gridiron. Little tables glittered with bright steel instruments\r\ncarelessly put down as if ready for use; a screw and vice loomed out,\r\ncasting ugly shadows; and in another nook was a saw with cruel jagged\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mr. Mathias; "they are, as you suggest, instruments of\r\ntorture,--of torture and death. Some--many, I may say--have been used; a\r\nfew are reproductions after ancient examples. Those knives were used for\r\nflaying; that frame is a rack, and a very fine specimen. Look at this;\r\nit comes from Venice. You see that sort of collar, something like a big\r\nhorse-shoe? Well, the patient, let us call him, sat down quite\r\ncomfortably, and the horse-shoe was neatly fitted round his neck. Then\r\nthe two ends were joined with a silken band, and the executioner began\r\nto turn a handle connected with the band. The horse-shoe contracted very\r\ngradually as the band tightened, and the turning continued till the man\r\nwas strangled. It all took place quietly, in one of those queer garrets\r\nunder the leads. But these things are all European; the Orientals are,\r\nof course, much more ingenious. These are the Chinese contrivances. You\r\nhave heard of the \'heavy death\'? It is my hobby, this sort of thing. Do\r\nyou know, I often sit here, hour after hour, and meditate over the\r\ncollection. I fancy I see the faces of the men who have suffered--faces\r\nlean with agony and wet with sweats of death--growing distinct out of\r\nthe gloom, and I hear the echoes of their cries for mercy. But I must\r\nshow you my latest acquisition. Come into the next room."\r\n\r\nI followed Mr. Mathias out. The weariness of the walk, the late hour,\r\nand the strangeness of it all, made me feel like a man in a dream;\r\nnothing would have surprised me very much. The second room was as the\r\nfirst, crowded with ghastly instruments; but beneath the lamp was a\r\nwooden platform, and a figure stood on it. It was a large statue of a\r\nnaked woman, fashioned in green bronze; the arms were stretched out, and\r\nthere was a smile on the lips; it might well have been intended for a\r\nVenus, and yet there was about the thing an evil and a deadly look.\r\n\r\nMr. Mathias looked at it complacently. "Quite a work of art, isn\'t it?"\r\nhe said. "It\'s made of bronze, as you see, but it has long had the name\r\nof the Iron Maid. I got it from Germany, and it was only unpacked this\r\nafternoon; indeed, I have not yet had time to open the letter of advice.\r\nYou see that very small knob between the breasts? Well, the victim was\r\nbound to the Maid, the knob was pressed, and the arms slowly tightened\r\nround the neck. You can imagine the result."\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Mathias talked, he patted the figure affectionately. I had turned\r\naway, for I sickened at the sight of the man and his loathsome treasure.\r\nThere was a slight click, of which I took no notice,--it was not much\r\nlouder than the tick of a clock; and then I heard a sudden whir, the\r\nnoise of machinery in motion, and I faced round. I have never forgotten\r\nthe hideous agony on Mathias\'s face as those relentless arms tightened\r\nabout his neck; there was a wild struggle as of a beast in the toils,\r\nand then a shriek that ended in a choking groan. The whirring noise had\r\nsuddenly changed into a heavy droning. I tore with all my might at the\r\nbronze arms, and strove to wrench them apart, but I could do nothing.\r\nThe head had slowly bent down, and the green lips were on the lips of\r\nMathias.\r\n\r\nOf course I had to attend at the inquest. The letter which had\r\naccompanied the figure was found unopened on the study table. The German\r\nfirm of dealers cautioned their client to be most careful in touching\r\nthe Iron Maid, as the machinery had been put in thorough working order.\r\n\r\nFor many revolving weeks Mr. Burton delighted Dyson by his agreeable\r\nconversation, diversified by anecdote, and interspersed with the\r\nnarration of singular adventures. Finally, however, he vanished as\r\nsuddenly as he had appeared, and on the occasion of his last visit he\r\ncontrived to loot a copy of his namesake\'s Anatomy. Dyson, considering\r\nthis violent attack on the rights of property, and certain glaring\r\ninconsistencies in the talk of his late friend, arrived at the\r\nconclusion that his stories were fabulous, and that the Iron Maid only\r\nexisted in the sphere of a decorative imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RECLUSE OF BAYSWATER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst the many friends who were favored with the occasional pleasure\r\nof Mr. Dyson\'s society was Mr. Edgar Russell, realist and obscure\r\nstruggler, who occupied a small back room on the second floor of a house\r\nin Abingdon Grove, Notting Hill. Turning off from the main street and\r\nwalking a few paces onward, one was conscious of a certain calm, a\r\ndrowsy peace, which made the feet inclined to loiter; and this was ever\r\nthe atmosphere of Abingdon Grove. The houses stood a little back, with\r\ngardens where the lilac and laburnum and blood-red may blossomed gayly\r\nin their seasons, and there was a corner where an older house in another\r\nstreet had managed to keep a back garden of real extent; a walled-in\r\ngarden whence there came a pleasant scent of greenness after the rains\r\nof early summer, where old elms held memories of the open fields, where\r\nthere was yet sweet grass to walk on. The houses in Abingdon Grove\r\nbelonged chiefly to the nondescript stucco period of thirty-five years\r\nago, tolerably built with passable accommodation for moderate incomes;\r\nthey had largely passed into the state of lodgings, and cards bearing\r\nthe inscription "Furnished Apartments" were not infrequent over the\r\ndoors. Here, then, in a house of sufficiently good appearance, Mr.\r\nRussell had established himself; for he looked upon the traditional\r\ndirt and squalor of Grub Street as a false and obsolete convention, and\r\npreferred, as he said, to live within sight of green leaves. Indeed,\r\nfrom his room one had a magnificent view of a long line of gardens, and\r\na screen of poplars shut out the melancholy back premises of Wilton\r\nStreet during the summer months. Mr. Russell lived chiefly on bread and\r\ntea, for his means were of the smallest; but when Dyson came to see him,\r\nhe would send out the slavey for six-ale, and Dyson was always at\r\nliberty to smoke as much of his own tobacco as he pleased. The landlady\r\nhad been so unfortunate as to have her drawing-room floor vacant for\r\nmany months; a card had long proclaimed the void within; and Dyson, when\r\nhe walked up the steps one evening in early autumn, had a sense that\r\nsomething was missing, and, looking at the fanlight, saw the appealing\r\ncard had disappeared.\r\n\r\n"You have let your first floor, have you?" he said, as he greeted Mr.\r\nRussell.\r\n\r\n"Yes; it was taken about a fortnight ago by a lady."\r\n\r\n"Indeed," said Dyson, always curious; "a young lady?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I believe so. She is a widow, and wears a thick crape veil. I have\r\nmet her once or twice on the stairs and in the street, but I should not\r\nknow her face."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Dyson, when the beer had arrived, and the pipes were in\r\nfull blast, "and what have you been doing? Do you find the work getting\r\nany easier?"\r\n\r\n"Alas!" said the young man, with an expression of great gloom, "the life\r\nis a purgatory, and all but a hell. I write, picking out my words,\r\nweighing and balancing the force of every syllable, calculating the\r\nminutest effects that language can produce, erasing and rewriting, and\r\nspending a whole evening over a page of manuscript. And then in the\r\nmorning when I read what I have written--Well, there is nothing to be\r\ndone but to throw it in the waste-paper basket if the verso has been\r\nalready written on, or to put it in the drawer if the other side happens\r\nto be clean. When I have written a phrase which undoubtedly embodies a\r\nhappy turn of thought, I find it dressed up in feeble commonplace; and\r\nwhen the style is good, it serves only to conceal the baldness of\r\nsuperannuated fancies. I sweat over my work, Dyson,--every finished line\r\nmeans so much agony. I envy the lot of the carpenter in the side street\r\nwho has a craft which he understands. When he gets an order for a table,\r\nhe does not writhe with anguish; but if I were so unlucky as to get an\r\norder for a book, I think I should go mad."\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow, you take it all too seriously. You should let the ink\r\nflow more readily. Above all, firmly believe, when you sit down to\r\nwrite, that you are an artist, and that whatever you are about is a\r\nmasterpiece. Suppose ideas fail you, say; as I heard one of our most\r\nexquisite artists say, "It\'s of no consequence; the ideas are all there,\r\nat the bottom of that box of cigarettes." You, indeed, smoke tobacco,\r\nbut the application is the same. Besides, you must have some happy\r\nmoments, and these should be ample consolation."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you are right. But such moments are so few; and then there is\r\nthe torture of a glorious conception matched, with execution beneath the\r\nstandard of the Family Story Paper. For instance, I was happy for two\r\nhours a night or two ago; I lay awake and saw visions. But then the\r\nmorning!"\r\n\r\n"What was your idea?"\r\n\r\n"It seemed to me a splendid one; I thought of Balzac and the \'Comedie\r\nHumaine,\' of Zola and the Rougon-Macquart family. It dawned upon me that\r\nI would write the history of a street. Every house should form a volume.\r\nI fixed upon the street, I saw each house, and read, as clearly as in\r\nletters, the physiology and psychology of each. The little by-way\r\nstretched before me in its actual shape,--a street that I know and have\r\npassed down a hundred times; with some twenty houses, prosperous and\r\nmean, and lilac bushes in purple blossom; and yet it was at the same\r\ntime a symbol, a _via dolorosa_ of hopes cherished and disappointed, of\r\nyears of monotonous existence without content or discontent, of\r\ntragedies and obscure sorrows; and on the door of one of those houses I\r\nsaw the red stain of blood, and behind a window two shadows, blackened\r\nand faded, on the blind, as they swayed on tightened cords,--the shadows\r\nof a man and a woman hanging in a vulgar, gas-lit parlor. These were my\r\nfancies; but when pen touched paper, they shrivelled and vanished away,"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said. Dyson, "there is a lot in that. I envy you the pains of\r\ntransmuting vision into reality, and still more I envy you the day when\r\nyou will look at your bookshelf and see twenty goodly books upon the\r\nshelves,--the series complete and done forever. Let me entreat you to\r\nhave them bound in solid parchment, with gold lettering. It is the only\r\nreal cover for a valiant book. When I look in at the windows of some\r\nchoice shop, and see the bindings of Levant morocco, with pretty tools\r\nand panellings, and your sweet contrasts of red and green, I say to\r\nmyself, \'These are not books, but bibelots.\' A book bound so--a true\r\nbook, mind you--is like a Gothic statue draped in brocade of Lyons."\r\n\r\n"Alas!" said Russell, "we need not discuss the binding,--the books are\r\nnot begun."\r\n\r\nThe talk went on as usual till eleven o\'clock, when Dyson bade his\r\nfriend good-night. He knew the way downstairs, and walked down by\r\nhimself; but greatly to his surprise, as he crossed the first-floor\r\nlanding, the door opened slightly, and a hand was stretched out,\r\nbeckoning.\r\n\r\nDyson was not the man to hesitate under such circumstances. In a moment\r\nhe saw himself involved in adventure; and, as he told himself, the\r\nDysons had never disobeyed a lady\'s summons. Softly, then, with due\r\nregard for the lady\'s honor, he would have entered the room, when a low\r\nbut clear voice spoke to him,--\r\n\r\n"Go downstairs and open the door, and shut it again rather loudly. Then\r\ncome up to me; and for heaven\'s sake, walk softly."\r\n\r\nDyson obeyed her commands,--not without some hesitation, for he was\r\nafraid of meeting the landlady or the maid on his return journey. But\r\nwalking like a cat, and making each step he trod on crack loudly, he\r\nflattered himself that he had escaped observation; and as he gained the\r\ntop of the stairs, the door opened wide before him, and he found himself\r\nin the lady\'s drawing-room, bowing awkwardly.\r\n\r\n"Pray be seated, sir. Perhaps this chair will be the best; it was the\r\nfavored chair of my landlady\'s deceased husband. I would ask you to\r\nsmoke, but the odor would betray me. I know my proceedings must seem to\r\nyou unconventional; but I saw you arrive this evening, and I do not\r\nthink you would refuse to help a woman who is so unfortunate as I am."\r\n\r\nMr. Dyson looked shyly at the young lady before him. She was dressed in\r\ndeep mourning; but the piquant smiling face and charming hazel eyes ill\r\naccorded with the heavy garments, and the mouldering surface of the\r\ncrape.\r\n\r\n"Madam," he said gallantly, "your instinct has served you well. We will\r\nnot trouble, if you please, about the question of social conventions;\r\nthe chivalrous gentleman knows nothing of such matters. I hope I may be\r\nprivileged to serve you."\r\n\r\n"You are very kind to me, but I knew it would be so. Alas, sir, I have\r\nhad experience of life, and I am rarely mistaken. Yet man is too often\r\nso vile and so misjudging that I trembled even as I resolved to take\r\nthis step, which, for all I knew, might prove to be both desperate and\r\nruinous."\r\n\r\n"With me you have nothing to fear," said Dyson. "I was nurtured in the\r\nfaith of chivalry, and I have always endeavored to remember the proud\r\ntraditions of my race. Confide in me then, and count upon my secrecy,\r\nand, if it prove possible, you may rely on my help."\r\n\r\n"Sir, I will not waste your time, which I am sure is valuable, by idle\r\nparleyings. Learn, then, that I am a fugitive, and in hiding here. I\r\nplace myself in your power; you have but to describe my features, and I\r\nfall into the hands of my relentless enemy."\r\n\r\nMr. Dyson wondered for a passing instant how this could be; but he only\r\nrenewed his promise of silence, repeating that he would be the embodied\r\nspirit of dark concealment.\r\n\r\n"Good," said the lady; "the Oriental fervor of your style is delightful.\r\nIn the first place, I must disabuse your mind of the conviction that I\r\nam a widow. These gloomy vestments have been forced on me by strange\r\ncircumstance; in plain language, I have deemed it expedient to go\r\ndisguised. You have a friend, I think, in the house,--Mr. Russell? He\r\nseems of a coy and retiring nature."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, madam," said Dyson, "he is not coy, but he is a realist; and\r\nperhaps you are aware that no Carthusian monk can emulate the cloistral\r\nseclusion in which a realistic novelist loves to shroud himself. It is\r\nhis way of observing human, nature."\r\n\r\n"Well, well," said the lady; "all this, though deeply interesting is not\r\ngermane to our affair. I must tell you my history."\r\n\r\nWith these words the young lady proceeded to relate the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL OF THE WHITE POWDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy name is Leicester; my father. Major General Wyn Leicester, a\r\ndistinguished officer of artillery, succumbed five years ago to a\r\ncomplicated liver complaint acquired in the deadly climate of India. A\r\nyear later my only brother, Francis, came home after an exceptionally\r\nbrilliant career at the University, and settled down with the resolution\r\nof a hermit to master what has been well called the great legend of the\r\nlaw. He was a man who seemed to live in utter indifference to everything\r\nthat is called pleasure; and though he was handsomer than most men, and\r\ncould talk as merrily and wittily as if he were a mere vagabond, he\r\navoided society, and shut himself up in a large room at the top of the\r\nhouse to make himself a lawyer. Ten hours a day of hard reading was at\r\nfirst his allotted portion; from the first light in the east to the late\r\nafternoon he remained shut up with his books, taking a hasty half-hour\'s\r\nlunch with me as if he grudged the wasting of the moments, and going out\r\nfor a short walk when it began to grow dusk. I thought that such\r\nrelentless application must be injurious, and tried to cajole him from\r\nthe crabbed text-books; but his ardor seemed to grow rather than\r\ndiminish, and his daily tale of hours increased. I spoke to him\r\nseriously, suggesting some occasional relaxation, if it were but an idle\r\nafternoon with a harmless novel; but he laughed, and said that he read\r\nabout feudal tenures when he felt in need of amusement, and scoffed at\r\nthe notion of theatres, or a month\'s fresh confessed that he looked\r\nwell, and seemed not to suffer from his labors; but I knew that such\r\nunnatural toil would take revenge at last, and I was not mistaken. A\r\nlook of anxiety began to lurk about his eyes, and he seemed languid, and\r\nat last he avowed that he was no longer in perfect health; he was\r\ntroubled, he said, with a sensation of dizziness, and awoke now and then\r\nof nights from fearful dreams, terrified and cold with icy sweats. "I am\r\ntaking care of myself," he said; "so you must not trouble. I passed the\r\nwhole of yesterday afternoon in idleness, leaning back in that\r\ncomfortable chair you gave me, and scribbling nonsense on a sheet of\r\npaper. No, no; I will not overdo my work. I shall be well enough in a\r\nweek or two, depend upon it."\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of his assurances, I could see that he grew no better, but\r\nrather worse; he would enter the drawing-room with a face all miserably\r\nwrinkled and despondent, and endeavor to look gayly when my eyes fell on\r\nhim, and I thought such symptoms of evil omen, and was frightened\r\nsometimes at the nervous irritation of his movements, and at glances\r\nwhich I could not decipher. Much against his will, I prevailed on him to\r\nhave medical advice, and with an ill grace he called in our old doctor.\r\n\r\nDr. Haberden cheered me after his examination of his patient.\r\n\r\n"There is nothing really much amiss," he said to me. "No doubt he reads\r\ntoo hard, and eats hastily, and then goes back again to his books in too\r\ngreat a hurry; and the natural consequence is some digestive trouble,\r\nand a little mischief in the nervous system. But I think--I do, indeed,\r\nMiss Leicester--that we shall be able to set this all right. I have\r\nwritten him a prescription which ought to do great things. So you have\r\nno cause for anxiety."\r\n\r\nMy brother insisted on having the prescription made up by a chemist in\r\nthe neighborhood; it was an odd old-fashioned shop, devoid of the\r\nstudied coquetry and calculated glitter that make so gay a show on the\r\ncounters and shelves of the modern apothecary; but Francis liked the old\r\nchemist, and believed in the scrupulous purity of his drugs. The\r\nmedicine was sent in due course, and I saw that my brother took it\r\nregularly after lunch and dinner. It was an innocent-looking white\r\npowder, of which a little was dissolved, in a glass of cold water. I\r\nstirred it in, and it seemed to disappear, leaving the water clear and\r\ncolorless. At first Francis seemed to benefit greatly; the weariness\r\nvanished from his face, and he became more cheerful than he had ever\r\nbeen since the time when he left school; he talked gayly of reforming\r\nhimself, and avowed to me that he had wasted his time.\r\n\r\n"I have given too many hours to law," he said, laughing; "I think you\r\nhave saved me in the nick of time. Come, I shall be Lord Chancellor yet,\r\nbut I must not forget life. You and I will have a holiday together\r\nbefore long; we will go to Paris and enjoy ourselves, and keep away from\r\nthe Bibliotheque Nationale."\r\n\r\nI confessed myself delighted with the prospect.\r\n\r\n"When shall we go?" I said. "I can start the day after to-morrow, if you\r\nlike."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that is perhaps a little too soon; after all, I do not know London\r\nyet, and I suppose a man ought to give the pleasures of his own country\r\nthe first choice. But we will go off together in a week or two, so try\r\nand furbish up your French. I only know law French myself, and I am\r\nafraid that wouldn\'t do."\r\n\r\nWe were just finishing dinner, and he quaffed off his medicine with a\r\nparade of carousal as if it had been wine from some choicest bin.\r\n\r\n"Has it any particular taste?" I said.\r\n\r\n"No; I should not know I was not drinking water," and he got up from his\r\nchair, and began to pace up and down the room as if he were undecided as\r\nto what he should do next.\r\n\r\n"Shall we have coffee in the drawing-room," I said, "or would you like\r\nto smoke?"\r\n\r\n"No; I think I will take a turn, it seems a pleasant evening. Look at\r\nthe afterglow; why, it is as if a great city were burning in flames, and\r\ndown there between the dark houses it is raining blood fast, fast. Yes,\r\nI will go out. I may be in soon, but I shall take my key, so good-night,\r\ndear, if I don\'t see you again."\r\n\r\nThe door slammed behind him, and I saw him walk lightly down the street,\r\nswinging his malacca cane, and I felt grateful to Dr. Haberden for such\r\nan improvement.\r\n\r\nI believe my brother came home very late that night; but he was in a\r\nmerry mood the next morning.\r\n\r\n"I walked on without thinking where I was going," he said, "enjoying the\r\nfreshness of the air, and livened by the crowds as I reached more\r\nfrequented quarters. And then I met an old college friend, Orford, in\r\nthe press of the pavement, and then--well, we enjoyed ourselves. I have\r\nfelt what it is to be young and a man, I find I have blood in my veins,\r\nas other men have. I made an appointment with Orford for to-night; there\r\nwill be a little party of us at the restaurant. Yes, I shall enjoy\r\nmyself for a week or two, and hear the chimes at midnight, and then we\r\nwill go for our little trip together."\r\n\r\nSuch was the transmutation of my brother\'s character that in a few days\r\nhe became a lover of pleasure, a careless and merry idler of western\r\npavements, a hunter out of snug restaurants, and a fine critic of\r\nfantastic dancing; he grew fat before my eyes, and said no more of\r\nParis, for he had clearly found his Paradise in London. I rejoiced, and\r\nyet wondered a little, for there was, I thought, something in his gayety\r\nthat indefinitely displeased me, though I could not have defined my\r\nfeeling. But by degrees there came a change; he returned still in the\r\ncold, hours of the morning, but I heard no more about his pleasures, and\r\none morning as we sat at breakfast together, I looked suddenly into his\r\neyes and saw a stranger before me.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Francis!" I cried; "Oh, Francis, Francis, what have you done?" and\r\nrending sobs cut the words short, and I went weeping out of the room,\r\nfor though I knew nothing, yet I knew all, and by some odd play of\r\nthought I remembered the evening when he first went abroad to prove his\r\nmanhood, and the picture of the sunset sky glowed before me; the clouds\r\nlike a city in burning flames, and the rain of blood. Yet I did battle\r\nwith such thoughts, resolving that perhaps, after all, no great harm\r\nhad been done, and in the evening at dinner I resolved to press him to\r\nfix a day for our holiday in Paris. We had talked easily enough, and my\r\nbrother had just taken his medicine, which he had continued all the\r\nwhile. I was about to begin my topic, when the words forming in my mind\r\nvanished, and I wondered for a second what icy and intolerable weight\r\noppressed my heart and suffocated me as with the unutterable horror of\r\nthe coffin-lid nailed down on the living.\r\n\r\nWe had dined without candles, and the room had slowly grown from\r\ntwilight to gloom, and the walls and corners were indistinct in the\r\nshadow. But from where I sat I looked out into the street; and as I\r\nthought of what I would say to Francis, the sky began to flush and\r\nshine, as it had done on a well-remembered evening, and in the gap\r\nbetween two dark masses that were houses an awful pageantry of flame\r\nappeared. Lurid whorls of writhed cloud, and utter depths burning, and\r\ngray masses like the fume blown from a smoking city, and an evil glory\r\nblazing far above shot with tongues of more ardent fire, and below as if\r\nthere were a deep pool of blood. I looked down to where my brother sat\r\nfacing me, and the words were shaped on my lips, when I saw his hand\r\nresting on the table. Between the thumb and forefinger of the closed\r\nhand, there was a mark, a small patch about the size of a sixpence, and\r\nsomewhat of the color of a bad bruise. Yet, by some sense I cannot\r\ndefine, I knew that what I saw was no bruise at all. Oh, if human flesh\r\ncould burn with flame, and if flame could be black as pitch, such was\r\nthat before me! Without thought or fashioning of words, gray horror\r\nshaped within me at the sight, and in an inner cell it was known to be a\r\nbrand. For a moment the stained sky became dark as midnight, and when\r\nthe light returned to me, I was alone in the silent room, and soon after\r\nI heard my brother go out.\r\n\r\nLate as it was, I put on my bonnet and went to Dr. Haberden, and in his\r\ngreat consulting-room, ill-lighted by a candle which the doctor brought\r\nin with him, with stammering lips, and a voice that would break in spite\r\nof my resolve, I told him all; from the day on which my brother began to\r\ntake the medicine down to the dreadful thing I had seen scarcely half an\r\nhour before.\r\n\r\nWhen I had done, the doctor looked at me for a minute with an expression\r\nof great pity on his face.\r\n\r\n"My dear Miss Leicester," he said, "you have evidently been anxious\r\nabout your brother; you have been worrying over him, I am sure. Come,\r\nnow, is it not so?\r\n\r\n"I have certainly been anxious," I said. "For the last week or two I\r\nhave not felt at ease."\r\n\r\n"Quite so; you know, of course, what a queer thing the brain is?"\r\n\r\n"I understand what you mean; but I was not deceived. I saw what I have\r\ntold you with my own eyes."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, of course. But your eyes had been staring at that very\r\ncurious sunset we had to-night. That is the only explanation. You will\r\nsee it in the proper light to-morrow, I am sure. But, remember, I am\r\nalways ready to give any help that is in my power; do not scruple to\r\ncome to me, or to send for me if you are in any distress."\r\n\r\nI went away but little comforted, all confusion and terror and sorrow,\r\nnot knowing where to turn. When my brother and I met the next day, I\r\nlooked quickly at him, and noticed, with a sickening at heart, that the\r\nright hand, the hand on which I had clearly seen the patch as of a black\r\nfire, was wrapped up with a handkerchief.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter with your hand, Francis?" I said in a steady voice.\r\n\r\n"Nothing of consequence. I cut a finger last night, and it bled rather\r\nawkwardly, so I did it up roughly to the best of my ability."\r\n\r\n"I will do it neatly for you, if you like."\r\n\r\n"No, thank you, dear, this will answer very well. Suppose we have\r\nbreakfast; I am quite hungry."\r\n\r\nWe sat down, and I watched him. He scarcely ate or drank at all, but\r\ntossed his meat to the dog when he thought my eyes were turned away; and\r\nthere was a look in his eyes that I had never yet seen, and the thought\r\nfled across my mind that it was a look that was scarcely human. I was\r\nfirmly convinced that awful and incredible as was the thing I had seen\r\nthe night before, yet it was no illusion, no glamour of bewildered\r\nsense, and in the course of the morning I went again to the doctor\'s\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head with an air puzzled and incredulous, and seemed to\r\nreflect for a few minutes.\r\n\r\n"And you say he still keeps up the medicine? But why? As I understand,\r\nall the symptoms he complained of have disappeared long ago; why should\r\nhe go on taking the stuff when he is quite well? And by the bye where\r\ndid he get it made up? At Sayce\'s? I never send any one there; the old\r\nman is getting careless. Suppose you come with me to the chemist\'s; I\r\nshould like to have some talk with him."\r\n\r\nWe walked together to the shop. Old Sayce knew Dr. Haberden, and was\r\nquite ready to give any information.\r\n\r\n"You have been sending that in to Mr. Leicester for some weeks, I think,\r\non my prescription," said the doctor, giving the old man a pencilled\r\nscrap of paper.\r\n\r\nThe chemist put on his great spectacles with trembling uncertainty, and\r\nheld up the paper with a shaking hand.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," he said, "I have very little of it left; it is rather an\r\nuncommon drug, and I have had it in stock some time. I must get in some\r\nmore, if Mr. Leicester goes on with it."\r\n\r\n"Kindly let me have a look at the stuff," said Haberden; and the chemist\r\ngave him a glass bottle. He took out the stopper and smelt the contents,\r\nand looked strangely at the old man.\r\n\r\n"Where did you get this?" he said, "and what is it? For one thing, Mr.\r\nSayce, it is not what I prescribed. Yes, yes, I see the label is right\r\nenough, but I tell you this is not the drug."\r\n\r\n"I have had it a long time," said the old man, in feeble terror. "I got\r\nit from Burbage\'s in the usual way. It is not prescribed often, and I\r\nhave had it on the shelf for some years. You see there is very little\r\nleft."\r\n\r\n"You had better give it to me," said Haberden. "I am afraid something\r\nwrong has happened."\r\n\r\nWe went out of the shop in silence, the doctor carrying the bottle\r\nneatly wrapped in paper under his arm.\r\n\r\n"Dr. Haberden," I said when we had walked a little way--"Dr. Haberden."\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, looking at me gloomily enough.\r\n\r\n"I should like you to tell me what my brother has been taking twice a\r\nday for the last month or so."\r\n\r\n"Frankly, Miss Leicester, I don\'t know. We will speak of this when we\r\nget to my house,"\r\n\r\nWe walked on quickly without another word till we reached Dr.\r\nHaberden\'s. He asked me to sit down, and began pacing up and down the\r\nroom, his face clouded over, as I could see, with no common fears.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said at length, "this is all very strange; it is only natural\r\nthat you should feel alarmed, and I must confess that my mind is far\r\nfrom easy. We will put aside, if you please, what you told me last night\r\nand this morning, but the fact remains that for the last few weeks Mr.\r\nLeicester has been impregnating his system with a drug which is\r\ncompletely unknown to me. I tell you, it is not what I ordered; and what\r\nthat stuff in the bottle really is remains to be seen."\r\n\r\nHe undid the wrapper, and cautiously tilted a few grains of the white\r\npowder on to a piece of paper, and peered curiously at it.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, "it is like the sulphate of quinine, as you say; it is\r\nflaky. But smell it."\r\n\r\nHe held the bottle to me, and I bent over it. It was a strange sickly\r\nsmell, vaporous and overpowering, like some strong anaesthetic.\r\n\r\n"I shall have it analyzed," said Haberden. "I have a friend who has\r\ndevoted his whole life to chemistry as a science. Then we shall have\r\nsomething to go upon. No, no, say no more about that other matter; I\r\ncannot listen to that, and take my advice and think no more about it\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\nThat evening my brother did not go out as usual after dinner.\r\n\r\n"I have had my fling," he said with a queer laugh; "and I must go back\r\nto my old ways. A little law will be quite a relaxation after so sharp a\r\ndose of pleasure," and he grinned to himself, and soon after went up to\r\nhis room. His hand was still all bandaged.\r\n\r\nDr. Haberden called a few days later.\r\n\r\n"I have no special news to give you," he said. "Chambers is out of town,\r\nso I know no more about that stuff than you do. But I should like to see\r\nMr. Leicester if he is in."\r\n\r\n"He is in his room," I said; "I will tell him you are here."\r\n\r\n"No, no, I will go up to him; we will have a little quiet talk together.\r\nI dare say that we have made a good deal of fuss about very little; for,\r\nafter all, whatever the white powder may be, it seems to have done him\r\ngood."\r\n\r\nThe doctor went upstairs, and standing in the hall I heard his knock,\r\nand the opening and shutting of the door; and then I waited in the\r\nsilent house for an hour, and the stillness grew more and more intense\r\nas the hands of the clock crept round. Then there sounded from above the\r\nnoise of a door shut sharply, and the doctor was coming down the stairs.\r\nHis footsteps crossed the hall, and there was a pause at the door. I\r\ndrew a long sick breath with difficulty, and saw my face white in a\r\nlittle mirror, and he came in and stood at the door. There was an\r\nunutterable horror shining in his eyes; he steadied himself by holding\r\nthe back of a chair with one hand, and his lower lip trembled like a\r\nhorse\'s, and he gulped and stammered unintelligible sounds before he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n"I have seen that man," he began in a dry whisper. "I have been sitting\r\nin his presence for the last hour. My God! and I am alive and in my\r\nsenses! I, who have dealt with death all my life, and have dabbled with\r\nthe melting ruins of the earthly tabernacle. But not this! Oh, not this,"\r\nand he covered his face with his hands as if to shut out the sight\r\nof something before him.\r\n\r\n"Do not send for me again, Miss Leicester," he said with more composure.\r\n"I can do nothing in this house. Good-bye."\r\n\r\nAs I watched him totter down the steps and along the pavement towards\r\nhis house, it seemed to me that he had aged by ten years since the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nMy brother remained in his room. He called out to me in a voice I hardly\r\nrecognized, that he was very busy, and would like his meals brought to\r\nhis door and left there, and I gave the order to the servants. From that\r\nday it seemed as if the arbitrary conception we call time had been\r\nannihilated for me. I lived in an ever present sense of horror, going\r\nthrough the routine of the house mechanically, and only speaking a few\r\nnecessary words to the servants. Now and then I went out and paced the\r\nstreets for an hour or two and came home again; but whether I were\r\nwithout or within, my spirit delayed before the closed door of the upper\r\nroom, and, shuddering, waited for it to open. I have said that I\r\nscarcely reckoned time, but I suppose it must have been a fortnight\r\nafter Dr. Haberden\'s visit that I came home from my stroll a little\r\nrefreshed and lightened. The air was sweet and pleasant, and the hazy\r\nform of green leaves, floating cloud-like in the square, and the smell\r\nof blossoms, had charmed my senses, and I felt happier and walked more\r\nbriskly. As I delayed a moment at the verge of the pavement, waiting for\r\na van to pass by before crossing over to the house, I happened to look\r\nup at the windows, and instantly there was the rush and swirl of deep\r\ncold waters in my ears, and my heart leapt up, and fell down, down as\r\ninto a deep hollow, and I was amazed with a dread and terror without\r\nform or shape. I stretched out a hand blindly through folds of thick\r\ndarkness, from the black and shadowy valley, and held myself from\r\nfalling, while the stones beneath my feet rocked and swayed and tilted,\r\nand the sense of solid things seemed to sink away from under me. I had\r\nglanced up at the window of my brother\'s study, and at that moment the\r\nblind was drawn aside, and something that had life stared out into the\r\nworld. Nay, I cannot say I saw a face or any human likeness; a living\r\nthing, two eyes of burning flame glared at me, and they were in the\r\nmidst of something as formless as my fear, the symbol and presence of\r\nall evil and all hideous corruption. I stood shuddering and quaking as\r\nwith the grip of ague, sick with unspeakable agonies of fear and\r\nloathing, and for five minutes I could not summon force or motion to my\r\nlimbs. When I was within the door, I ran up the stairs to my brother\'s\r\nroom, and knocked.\r\n\r\n"Francis, Francis," I cried, "for heaven\'s sake answer me. What is the\r\nhorrible thing in your room? Cast it out, Francis, cast it from you!"\r\n\r\nI heard a noise as of feet shuffling slowly and awkwardly, and a\r\nchoking, gurgling sound, as if some one was struggling to find\r\nutterance, and then the noise of a voice, broken and stifled, and words\r\nthat I could scarcely understand.\r\n\r\n"There is nothing here," the voice said, "Pray do not disturb me. I am\r\nnot very well to-day."\r\n\r\nI turned away, horrified and yet helpless. I could do nothing, and I\r\nwondered why Francis had lied to me, for I had seen the appearance\r\nbeyond the glass too plainly to be deceived, though it was but the sight\r\nof a moment. And I sat still, conscious that there had been something\r\nelse, something I had seen in the first flash of terror before those\r\nburning eyes had looked at me. Suddenly I remembered; as I lifted my\r\nface the blind was being drawn back, and I had had an instant\'s glance\r\nof the thing that was moving it, and in my recollection I knew that a\r\nhideous image was engraved forever on my brain. It was not a hand: there\r\nwere no fingers that held the blind, but a black stump pushed it aside;\r\nthe mouldering outline and the clumsy movement as of a beast\'s paw had\r\nglowed into my senses before the darkling waves of terror had\r\noverwhelmed me as I went down quick into the pit. My mind was aghast at\r\nthe thought of this, and of the awful presence that dwelt with my\r\nbrother in his room; I went to his door and cried to him again, but no\r\nanswer came. That night one of the servants came up to me and told me in\r\na whisper that for three days food had been regularly placed at the door\r\nand left untouched; the maid had knocked, but had received no answer;\r\nshe had heard the noise of shuffling feet that I had noticed. Day after\r\nday went by, and still my brother\'s meals were brought to his door and\r\nleft untouched; and though I knocked and called again and again, I could\r\nget no answer. The servants began to talk to me; it appeared they were\r\nas alarmed as I. The cook said that when my brother first shut himself\r\nup in his room, she used to hear him come out at night and go about the\r\nhouse; and once, she said, the hall door had opened and closed again,\r\nbut for several nights she had heard no sound. The climax came at last.\r\nIt was in the dusk of the evening, and I was sitting in the darkening\r\ndreary room when a terrible shriek jarred and rang harshly out of the\r\nsilence, and I heard a frightened scurry of feet dashing down the\r\nstairs. I waited, and the servant maid staggered into the room and faced\r\nme, white and trembling.\r\n\r\n"O Miss Helen," she whispered. "Oh, for the Lord\'s sake, Miss Helen,\r\nwhat has happened? Look at my hand, miss; look at that hand!" I drew her\r\nto the window, and saw there was a black wet stain upon her hand.\r\n\r\n"I do not understand you," I said. "Will you explain to me?"\r\n\r\n"I was doing your room just now," she began. "I was turning down the\r\nbedclothes, and all of a sudden there was something fell upon my hand\r\nwet, and I looked up, and the ceiling was black and dripping on me."\r\n\r\nI looked bard at her, and bit my lip. "Come with me," I said. "Bring\r\nyour candle with you."\r\n\r\nThe room I slept in was beneath my brother\'s, and as I went in I felt I\r\nwas trembling. I looked up at the ceiling, and saw a patch, all black\r\nand wet and a dew of black drops upon it, and a pool of horrible liquor\r\nsoaking into the white bedclothes.\r\n\r\nI ran upstairs and knocked loudly.\r\n\r\n"O Francis, Francis, my dear brother," I cried, "what has happened to\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\nAnd I listened. There was a sound of choking, and a noise like water\r\nbubbling and regurgitating, but nothing else, and I called louder, but\r\nno answer came.\r\n\r\nIn spite of what Dr. Haberden had said, I went to him, and with tears\r\nstreaming down my cheeks, I told him of all that had happened, and he\r\nlistened to me with a face set hard and grim.\r\n\r\n"For your father\'s sake," he said at last, "I will go with you, though I\r\ncan do nothing."\r\n\r\nWe went out together; the streets were dark and silent, and heavy with\r\nheat and a drought of many weeks. I saw the doctor\'s face white under\r\nthe gas-lamps, and when we reached the house his hand was shaking. We\r\ndid not hesitate, but went upstairs directly. I held the lamp, and he\r\ncalled out in a loud, determined voice:--\r\n\r\n"Mr. Leicester, do you hear me? I insist on seeing you. Answer me at\r\nonce."\r\n\r\nThere was no answer, but we both heard that choking noise I have\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Leicester, I am waiting for you. Open the door this instant, or I\r\nshall break it down." And he called a third time in a voice that rang\r\nand echoed from the walls.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Leicester! For the last time I order you to open the door."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" he said, after a pause of heavy silence, "we are wasting time\r\nhere. Will you be so kind as to get me a poker, or something of the\r\nkind?"\r\n\r\nI ran into a little room at the back where odd articles were kept, and\r\nfound a heavy adze-like tool that I thought might serve the doctor\'s\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n"Very good," he said, "that will do, I dare say. I give you notice, Mr.\r\nLeicester," he cried loudly at the keyhole, "that I am now about to break\r\ninto your room."\r\n\r\nThen I heard the wrench of the adze, and the woodwork split and cracked\r\nunder it, and with a loud crash the door suddenly burst open; and for a\r\nmoment we started back aghast at a fearful screaming cry, no human\r\nvoice, but as the roar of a monster, that burst forth inarticulate and\r\nstruck at us out of the darkness.\r\n\r\n"Hold the lamp," said the doctor, and we went in and glanced quickly\r\nround the room. "There it is," said Dr. Haberden, drawing a quick\r\nbreath; "look, in that corner."\r\n\r\nI looked, and a pang of horror seized my heart as with a white-hot iron.\r\nThere upon the floor was a dark and putrid mass, seething with\r\ncorruption and hideous rottenness, neither liquid nor solid, but\r\nmelting and changing before our eyes, and bubbling with unctuous oily\r\nbubbles like boiling pitch. And out of the midst of it shone two burning\r\npoints like eyes, and I saw a writhing and stirring as of limbs, and\r\nsomething moved and lifted up that might have been an arm. The doctor\r\ntook a step forward, and raised the iron bar and struck at the burning\r\npoints, and drove in the weapon, and struck again and again in a fury of\r\nloathing. At last the thing was quiet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA week or two later, when I had to some extent recovered from the\r\nterrible shock, Dr. Haberden came to see me.\r\n\r\n"I have sold my practice," he began, "and to-morrow I am sailing on a\r\nlong voyage. I do not know whether I shall ever return to England; in\r\nall probability I shall buy a little land in California, and settle\r\nthere for the remainder of my life. I have brought you this packet,\r\nwhich you may open and read when you feel able to do so. It contains the\r\nreport of Dr. Chambers on what I submitted to him. Good-bye, Miss\r\nLeicester, good-bye."\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone, I opened the envelope; I could not wait, and proceeded\r\nto read the papers within. Here is the manuscript; and if you will allow\r\nme, I will read you the astounding story it contains.\r\n\r\n"My dear Haberden," the letter began, "I have delayed inexcusably in\r\nanswering your questions as to the white substance you sent me. To tell\r\nyou the truth, I have hesitated for some time as to what course I should\r\nadopt, for there is a bigotry and an orthodox standard in physical\r\nscience as in theology, and I knew that if I told you the truth I\r\nshould offend rooted prejudices which I once held dear myself. However,\r\nI have determined to be plain with you, and first I must enter into a\r\nshort personal explanation.\r\n\r\n"You have known me, Haberden, for many years as a scientific man; you\r\nand I have often talked of our profession together, and discussed the\r\nhopeless gulf that opens before the feet of those who think to attain to\r\ntruth by any means whatsoever, except the beaten way of experiment and\r\nobservation, in the sphere of material things. I remember the scorn with\r\nwhich you have spoken to me of men of science who have dabbled a little\r\nin the unseen, and have timidly hinted that perhaps the senses are not,\r\nafter all, the eternal, impenetrable bounds of all knowledge, the\r\neverlasting walls beyond which no human being has ever passed. We have\r\nlaughed together heartily, and I think justly, at the "occult" follies\r\nof the day, disguised under various names,--the mesmerisms,\r\nspiritualisms, materializations, theosophies, all the rabble rant of\r\nimposture, with their machinery of poor tricks and feeble conjuring, the\r\ntrue back-parlor magic of shabby London streets. Yet, in spite of what I\r\nhave said, I must confess to you that I am no materialist, taking the\r\nword of course in its usual signification. It is now many years since I\r\nhave convinced myself, convinced myself a sceptic remember, that the old\r\niron-bound theory is utterly and entirely false. Perhaps this confession\r\nwill not wound you so sharply as it would have done twenty years ago;\r\nfor I think you cannot have failed to notice that for some time\r\nhypotheses have been advanced by men of pure science which are nothing\r\nless than transcendental, and I suspect that most modern chemists and\r\nbiologists of repute would not hesitate to subscribe the _dictum_ of the\r\nold Schoolman, _Omnia exeunt in mysterium_, which means, I take it, that\r\nevery branch of human knowledge if traced up to its source and final\r\nprinciples vanishes into mystery. I need not trouble you now with a\r\ndetailed account of the painful steps which led me to my conclusions; a\r\nfew simple experiments suggested a doubt as to my then standpoint, and a\r\ntrain of thought that rose from circumstances comparatively trifling\r\nbrought me far. My old conception of the universe has been swept away,\r\nand I stand in a world that seems as strange and awful to me as the\r\nendless waves of the ocean seen for the first time, shining, from a Peak\r\nin Darien. Now I know that the walls of sense that seemed so\r\nimpenetrable, that seemed to loom up above the heavens and to be founded\r\nbelow the depths, and to shut us in forevermore, are no such everlasting\r\nimpassable barriers as we fancied, but thinnest and most airy veils that\r\nmelt away before the seeker, and dissolve as the early mist of the\r\nmorning about the brooks. I know that you never adopted the extreme\r\nmaterialistic position: you did not go about trying to prove a universal\r\nnegative, for your logical sense withheld you from that crowning\r\nabsurdity; yet I am sure that you will find all that I am saying strange\r\nand repellent to your habits of thought. Yet, Haberden, what I tell you\r\nis the truth, nay, to adopt our common language, the sole and scientific\r\ntruth, verified by experience; and the universe is verily more splendid\r\nand more awful than we used to dream. The whole universe, my friend, is\r\na tremendous sacrament; a mystic, ineffable force and energy, veiled by\r\nan outward form of matter; and man, and the sun and the other stars, and\r\nthe flower of the grass, and the crystal in the test-tube, are each and\r\nevery one as spiritual, as material, and subject to an inner working.\r\n\r\n"You will perhaps wonder, Haberden, whence all this tends; but I think a\r\nlittle thought will make it clear. You will understand that from such a\r\nstandpoint the whole view of things is changed, and what we thought\r\nincredible and absurd may be possible enough. In short, we must look at\r\nlegend and belief with other eyes, and be prepared to accept tales that\r\nhad become mere fables. Indeed, this is no such great demand. After all,\r\nmodern science will concede as much, in a hypocritical manner. You must\r\nnot, it is true, believe in witchcraft, but you may credit hypnotism;\r\nghosts are out of date, but there is a good deal to be said for the\r\ntheory of telepathy. Give a superstition a Greek name, and believe in\r\nit, should almost be a proverb.\r\n\r\n"So much for my personal explanation. You sent me, Haberden, a phial,\r\nstoppered and sealed, containing a small quantity of a flaky white\r\npowder, obtained from a chemist who has been dispensing it to one of\r\nyour patients. I am not surprised to hear that this powder refused to\r\nyield any results to your analysis. It is a substance which was known to\r\na few many hundred years ago, but which I never expected to have\r\nsubmitted to me from the shop of a modern apothecary. There seems no\r\nreason to doubt the truth of the man\'s tale; he no doubt got, as he\r\nsays, the rather uncommon salt you prescribed from the wholesale\r\nchemist\'s; and it has probably remained on his shelf for twenty years,\r\nor perhaps longer. Here what we call chance and coincidence begins to\r\nwork; during all these years the salt in the bottle was exposed to\r\ncertain recurring variations of temperature, variations probably ranging\r\nfrom 40 deg. to 80 deg. And, as it happens, such changes, recurring year after\r\nyear at irregular intervals, and with varying degrees of intensity and\r\nduration, have constituted a process, and a process so complicated and\r\nso delicate, that I question whether modern scientific apparatus\r\ndirected with the utmost precision could produce the same result. The\r\nwhite powder you sent me is something very different from the drug you\r\nprescribed; it is the powder from which the wine of the Sabbath, the\r\n_Vinum Sabbati_ was prepared. No doubt you have read of the Witches\'\r\nSabbath, and have laughed at the tales which terrified our ancestors;\r\nthe black cats, and the broomsticks, and dooms pronounced against some\r\nold woman\'s cow. Since I have known the truth I have often reflected\r\nthat it is on the whole a happy thing that such burlesque as this is\r\nbelieved, for it serves to conceal much that it is better should not be\r\nknown generally. However, if you care to read the appendix to Payne\r\nKnight\'s monograph, you will find that the true Sabbath was something\r\nvery different, though the writer has very nicely refrained from\r\nprinting all he knew. The secrets of the true Sabbath were the secrets\r\nof remote times surviving into the Middle Ages, secrets of an evil\r\nscience which existed long before Aryan man entered Europe. Men and\r\nwomen, seduced from their homes on specious pretences, were met by\r\nbeings well qualified to assume, as they did assume, the part of devils,\r\nand taken by their guides to some, desolate and lonely place, known to\r\nthe initiate by long tradition and unknown to all else. Perhaps it was a\r\ncave in some bare and wind-swept hill; perhaps some inmost recess of a\r\ngreat forest, and there the Sabbath was held. There, in the blackest\r\nhour of night, the _Vinum Sabbati_ was prepared, and this evil graal was\r\npoured forth and offered to the neophytes, and they partook of an\r\ninfernal sacrament; _sumentes calicem principis inferorum,_ as an old\r\nauthor well expresses it. And suddenly, each one that had drunk found\r\nhimself attended by a companion, a shape of glamour and unearthly\r\nallurement, beckoning him apart to share in joys more exquisite, more\r\npiercing than the thrill of any dream, to the consummation of the\r\nmarriage of the Sabbath. It is hard to write of such things as these,\r\nand chiefly because that shape that allured with loveliness was no\r\nhallucination, but, awful as it is to express, the man himself. By the\r\npower of that Sabbath wine, a few grains of white powder thrown into a\r\nglass of water, the house of life was riven asunder, and the human\r\ntrinity dissolved, and the worm which never dies, that which lies\r\nsleeping within us all, was made tangible and an external thing, and\r\nclothed with a garment of flesh. And then in the hour of midnight, the\r\nprimal fall was repeated and represented, and the awful thing veiled in\r\nthe mythos of the Tree in the Garden was done anew. Such was the\r\n_nuptiae Sabbati_.\r\n\r\n"I prefer to say no more; you, Haberden, know as well as I do that the\r\nmost trivial laws of life are not to be broken with impunity; and for so\r\nterrible an act as this, in which the very inmost place of the temple\r\nwas broken open and defiled, a terrible vengeance followed. What began\r\nwith corruption ended also with corruption."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUnderneath is the following in Dr. Haberden\'s writing:--\r\n\r\n"The whole of the above is unfortunately strictly and entirely true.\r\nYour brother confessed all to me on that morning when I saw him in his\r\nroom. My attention was first attracted to the bandaged hand, and I\r\nforced him to show it me. What I saw made me, a medical man of many\r\nyears standing, grow sick with loathing; and the story I was forced to\r\nlisten to was infinitely more frightful than I could have believed\r\npossible. It has tempted me to doubt the Eternal Goodness which can\r\npermit nature to offer such hideous possibilities; and if you had not\r\nwith your own eyes seen the end, I should have said to you--disbelieve\r\nit all. I have not, I think, many more weeks to live, but you are young,\r\nand may forget all this.\r\n\r\n                        "JOSEPH HABERDEN, M.D."\r\n\r\nIn the course of two or three months I heard that Dr. Haberden had died\r\nat sea, shortly after the ship left England.\r\n\r\nMiss Leicester ceased speaking, and looked pathetically at Dyson, who\r\ncould not refrain from exhibiting some symptoms of uneasiness.\r\n\r\nHe stuttered out some broken phrases expressive of his deep interest in\r\nher extraordinary history, and then said with a better grace--\r\n\r\n"But, pardon me, Miss Leicester, I understood you were in some\r\ndifficulty. You were kind enough to ask me to assist you in some way."\r\n\r\n"Ah," she said, "I had forgotten that. My own present trouble seems of\r\nsuch little consequence in comparison with what I have told you. But as\r\nyou are so good to me, I will go on. You will scarcely believe it, but I\r\nfound that certain persons suspected, or rather pretended to suspect\r\nthat I had murdered my brother. These persons were relatives of mine,\r\nand their motives were extremely sordid ones; but I actually found\r\nmyself subject to the shameful indignity of being watched. Yes, sir, my\r\nsteps were dogged when I went abroad, and at home I found myself exposed\r\nto constant if artful observation. With my high spirit this was more\r\nthan I could brook, and I resolved to set my wits to work and elude the\r\npersons who were shadowing me. I was so fortunate as to succeed. I\r\nassumed this disguise, and for some time have lain snug and unsuspected.\r\nBut of late I have reason to believe that the pursuer is on my track;\r\nunless I am greatly deceived, I saw yesterday the detective who is\r\ncharged with the odious duty of observing my movements. You, sir, are\r\nwatchful and keen-sighted; tell me, did you see any one lurking about\r\nthis evening?"\r\n\r\n"I hardly think so," said Dyson, "but perhaps you would give me some\r\ndescription of the detective in question."\r\n\r\n"Certainly; he is a youngish man, dark, with dark whiskers. He has\r\nadopted spectacles of large size in the hope of disguising himself\r\neffectually, but he cannot disguise his uneasy manner, and the quick,\r\nnervous glances he casts to right and left."\r\n\r\nThis piece of description was the last straw for the unhappy Dyson, who\r\nwas foaming with impatience to get out of the house, and would gladly\r\nhave sworn eighteenth century oaths if propriety had not frowned on such\r\na course.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, Miss Leicester," he said with cold politeness, "I cannot\r\nassist you."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" she said sadly, "I have offended you in some way. Tell me what I\r\nhave done, and I will ask you to forgive me."\r\n\r\n"You are mistaken," said Dyson, grabbing his hat, but speaking with some\r\ndifficulty; "you have done nothing. But, as I say, I cannot help you.\r\nPerhaps," he added, with some tinge of sarcasm, "my friend Russell might\r\nbe of service."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," she replied; "I will try him," and the lady went off into a\r\nshriek of laughter, which filled up Mr. Dyson\'s cup of scandal and\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nHe left the house shortly afterwards, and had the peculiar delight of a\r\nfive-mile walk, through streets which slowly changed from black to gray,\r\nand from gray to shining passages of glory for the sun to brighten. Here\r\nand there he met or overtook strayed revellers, but he reflected that no\r\none could have spent the night in a more futile fashion than himself;\r\nand when he reached his home he had made resolves for reformation. He\r\ndecided that he would abjure all Milesian and Arabian methods of\r\nentertainment, and subscribe to Mudie\'s for a regular supply of mild and\r\ninnocuous romance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRANGE OCCURRENCE IN CLERKENWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Dyson had inhabited for some years a couple of rooms in a moderately\r\nquiet street in Bloomsbury, where, as he somewhat pompously expressed\r\nit, he held his finger on the pulse of life without being deafened with\r\nthe thousand rumors of the main arteries of London. It was to him a\r\nsource of peculiar, if esoteric gratification, that from the adjacent\r\ncorner of Tottenham Court Road a hundred lines of omnibuses went to the\r\nfour quarters of the town; he would dilate on the facilities for\r\nvisiting Dalston, and dwell on the admirable line that knew extremest\r\nEaling and the streets beyond Whitechapel. His rooms, which had been\r\noriginally "furnished apartments," he had gradually purged of their more\r\npeccant parts; and though one would not find here the glowing splendors\r\nof his old chambers in the street off the Strand, there was something of\r\nsevere grace about the appointments which did credit to his taste. The\r\nrugs were old, and of the true faded beauty; the etchings, nearly all of\r\nthem proofs printed by the artist, made a good show with broad white\r\nmargins and black frames, and there was no spurious black oak. Indeed,\r\nthere was but little furniture of any kind: a plain and honest table,\r\nsquare and sturdy, stood in one corner; a seventeenth century settle\r\nfronted the hearth; and two wooden elbow-chairs, and a bookshelf of the\r\nEmpire made up the equipment, with an exception worthy of note. For\r\nDyson cared for none of these things. His place was at his own bureau, a\r\nquaint old piece of lacquered-work at which he would sit for hour after\r\nhour, with his back to the room, engaged in the desperate pursuit of\r\nliterature, or, as he termed his profession, the chase of the phrase.\r\nThe neat array of pigeon-holes and drawers teemed and overflowed with\r\nmanuscript and note-books, the experiments and efforts of many years;\r\nand the inner well, a vast and cavernous receptacle, was stuffed with\r\naccumulated ideas. Dyson was a craftsman who gloved all the detail and\r\nthe technique of his work intensely; and if, as has been hinted, he\r\ndeluded himself a little with the name of artist, yet his amusements\r\nwere eminently harmless, and, so far as can be ascertained, he (or the\r\npublishers) had chosen the good part of not tiring the world with\r\nprinted matter.\r\n\r\nHere, then, Dyson would shut himself up with his fancies, experimenting\r\nwith words, and striving, as his friend the recluse of Bayswater strove,\r\nwith the almost invincible problem of style, but always with a fine\r\nconfidence, extremely different from the chronic depression of the\r\nrealist. He had been almost continuously at work on some scheme that\r\nstruck him as well-nigh magical in its possibilities since the night of\r\nhis adventure with the ingenious tenant of the first floor in Abingdon\r\nGrove; and as he laid down the pen with a glow of triumph, he reflected\r\nthat he had not viewed, the streets for five days in succession. With\r\nall the enthusiasm of his accomplished labor still working in his brain,\r\nhe put away his papers, and went out, pacing the pavement at first in\r\nthat rare mood of exultation which finds in every stone upon the way the\r\npossibilities of a masterpiece. It was growing late, and the autumn\r\nevening was drawing to a close amidst veils of haze and mist, and in the\r\nstilled air the voices, and the roaring traffic, and incessant feet\r\nseemed, to Dyson like the noise upon the stage when all the house is\r\nsilent. In the square, the leaves rippled down as quick as summer rain,\r\nand the street beyond was beginning to flare with the lights in the\r\nbutcher\'s shops and the vivid illumination of the green-grocer. It was a\r\nSaturday night, and the swarming populations of the slums were turning\r\nout in force; the battered women in rusty black had begun to paw the\r\nlumps of cagmag, and others gloated over unwholesome cabbages, and there\r\nwas a brisk demand for four-ale. Dyson passed through these night-fires\r\nwith some relief; he loved to meditate, but his thoughts were not as De\r\nQuincey\'s after his dose; he cared not two straws whether onions were\r\ndear or cheap, and would not have exulted if meat had fallen to twopence\r\na pound. Absorbed in the wilderness of the tale he had been writing,\r\nweighing nicely the points of plot and construction, relishing the\r\nrecollection of this and that happy phrase, and dreading failure here\r\nand there, he left the rush and the whistle of the gas-flares behind\r\nhim, and began to touch upon pavements more deserted.\r\n\r\nHe had turned, without taking note, to the northward, and was passing\r\nthrough an ancient fallen street, where now notices of floors and\r\noffices to let hung out, but still about it there was the grace and the\r\nstiffness of the Age of Wigs; a broad roadway, a broad pavement, and on\r\neach side a grave line of houses with long and narrow windows flush with\r\nthe walls, all of mellowed brick-work. Dyson walked with quick steps, as\r\nhe resolved that short work must be made of a certain episode; but he\r\nwas in that happy humor of invention, and another chapter rose in the\r\ninner chamber of his brain, and he dwelt on the circumstances he was to\r\nwrite down with curious pleasure. It was charming to have the quiet\r\nstreets to walk in, and in his thought he made a whole district the\r\ncabinet of his studies, and vowed he would come again. Heedless of his\r\ncourse, he struck off to the east again, and soon found himself involved\r\nin a squalid network of gray two-storied houses, and then in the waste\r\nvoid and elements of brick-work, the passages and unmade roads behind\r\ngreat factory walls, encumbered with the refuse of the neighborhood,\r\nforlorn, ill-lighted, and desperate. A brief turn, and there rose before\r\nhim the unexpected, a hill suddenly lifted from the level ground, its\r\nsteep ascent marked by the lighted lamps, and eager as an explorer Dyson\r\nfound his way to the place, wondering where his crooked paths had\r\nbrought him. Here all was again decorous, but hideous in the extreme.\r\nThe builder, some one lost in the deep gloom of the early \'twenties, had\r\nconceived the idea of twin villas in gray brick, shaped in a manner to\r\nrecall the outlines of the Parthenon, each with its classic form\r\nbroadly marked with raised bands of stucco. The name of the street was\r\nall strange, and for a further surprise, the top of the hill was crowned\r\nwith an irregular plot of grass and fading trees, called a square, and\r\nhere again the Parthenon-motive had persisted. Beyond the streets were\r\ncurious, wild in their irregularities, here a row of sordid, dingy\r\ndwellings, dirty and disreputable in appearance, and there, without\r\nwarning, stood a house genteel and prim with wire blinds and brazen\r\nknocker, as clean and trim as if it had been the doctor\'s house in some\r\nbenighted little country town. These surprises and discoveries began to\r\nexhaust Dyson, and he hailed with delight the blazing windows of a\r\npublic-house, and went in with the intention of testing the beverage\r\nprovided for the dwellers in this region, as remote as Libya and\r\nPamphylia and the parts about Mesopotamia. The babble of voices from\r\nwithin warned him that he was about to assist at the true parliament of\r\nthe London workman, and he looked about him for that more retired\r\nentrance called private. When he had settled himself on an exiguous\r\nbench, and had ordered some beer, he began to listen to the jangling\r\ntalk in the public bar beyond; it was a senseless argument, alternately\r\nfurious and maudlin, with appeals to Bill and Tom, and mediaeval\r\nsurvivals of speech, words that Chaucer wrote belched out with zeal and\r\nrelish, and the din of pots jerked down and coppers rapped smartly on\r\nthe zinc counter made a thorough bass for it all. Dyson was calmly\r\nsmoking his pipe between the sips of beer, when an indefinite looking\r\nfigure slid rather than walked into the compartment. The man started\r\nviolently when he saw Dyson placidly sitting in the corner, and glanced\r\nkeenly about him. He seemed to be on wires, controlled by some electric\r\nmachine, for he almost bolted out of the door when the barman asked with\r\nwhat he could serve him, and his hand shivered as he took the glass.\r\nDyson inspected him with a little curiosity; he was muffled up almost to\r\nthe lips, and a soft felt hat was drawn down over his eyes; he looked as\r\nif he shrank from every glance, and a more raucous voice suddenly\r\nuplifted in the public bar seemed to find in him a sympathy that made\r\nhim shake and quiver like a jelly. It was pitiable to see any one so\r\nthrilled with nervousness, and Dyson was about to address some trivial\r\nremark of casual inquiry to the man, when another person came into the\r\ncompartment, and, laying a hand on his arm, muttered something in an\r\nundertone, and vanished as he came. But Dyson had recognized him as the\r\nsmooth-tongued and smooth-shaven Burton, who had displayed so sumptuous\r\na gift in lying; and yet he thought little of it, for his whole faculty\r\nof observation was absorbed in the lamentable and yet grotesque\r\nspectacle before him. At the first touch of the hand on his arm, the\r\nunfortunate man had wheeled round as if spun on a pivot, and shrank back\r\nwith a low, piteous cry, as if some dumb beast were caught in the toils.\r\nThe blood fled away from the wretch\'s face, and the skin became gray as\r\nif a shadow of death had passed in the air and fallen on it, and Dyson\r\ncaught a choking whisper--\r\n\r\n"Mr. Davies! For God\'s sake, have pity on me, Mr. Davies. On my oath, I\r\nsay--" and his voice sank to silence as he heard the message, and strove\r\nin vain to bite his lip; and summon up to his aid some tinge of manhood.\r\nHe stood there a moment, wavering as the leaves of an aspen, and then he\r\nwas gone out into the street, as Dyson thought silently, with his doom\r\nupon his head. He had not been gone a minute when it suddenly flashed\r\ninto Dyson\'s mind that he knew the man; it was undoubtedly the young man\r\nwith spectacles for whom so many ingenious persons were searching; the\r\nspectacles indeed were missing, but the pale face, the dark whiskers,\r\nand the timid glances were enough to identify him, Dyson saw at once\r\nthat by a succession of hazards he had unawares hit upon the scent of\r\nsome desperate conspiracy, wavering as the track of a loathsome snake in\r\nand out of the highways and byways of the London cosmos; the truth was\r\ninstantly pictured before him, and he divined that all unconscious and\r\nunheeding he had been privileged to see the shadows of hidden forms,\r\nchasing and hurrying, and grasping and vanishing across the bright\r\ncurtain of common life, soundless and silent, or only babbling fables\r\nand pretences. For him in an instant the jargoning of voices, the garish\r\nsplendor, and all the vulgar tumult of the public-house became part of\r\nmagic; for here before his eyes a scene in this grim mystery play had\r\nbeen enacted, and he had seen human flesh grow gray with a palsy of\r\nfear; the very hell of cowardice and terror had gaped wide within an\r\narm\'s breadth. In the midst of these reflections, the barman came up and\r\nstared at him as if to hint that he had exhausted his right to take his\r\nease, and Dyson bought another lease of the seat by an order for more\r\nbeer. As he pondered the brief glimpse of tragedy, he recollected that\r\nwith his first start of haunted fear the young man with whiskers had\r\ndrawn his hand swiftly from his great coat pocket, and that he had heard\r\nsomething fall to the ground; and pretending to have dropped his pipe,\r\nDyson began to grope in the corner, searching with his fingers. He\r\ntouched some thing, and drew it gently to him, and with one brief\r\nglance, as he put it quietly in his pocket, he saw it was a little\r\nold-fashioned note book, bound in faded green morocco.\r\n\r\nHe drank down his beer at a gulp, and left the place, overjoyed at his\r\nfortunate discovery, and busy with conjecture as to the possible\r\nimportance of the find. By turns he dreaded to find perhaps mere blank\r\nleaves, or the labored follies of a betting-book, but the faded morocco\r\ncover seemed to promise better things, and hint at mysteries. He piloted\r\nhimself with no little difficulty out of the sour and squalid quarter he\r\nhad entered with a light heart, and emerging at Gray\'s Inn Road, struck\r\noff down Guilford Street, and hastened home, only anxious for a lighted\r\ncandle and solitude.\r\n\r\nDyson sat down at his bureau, and placed the little book before him; it\r\nwas an effort to open the leaves and dare disappointment. But in\r\ndesperation at last he laid his finger between the pages at haphazard,\r\nand rejoiced to see a compact range of writing with a margin, and as it\r\nchanced, three words caught his glance, and stood out apart from the\r\nmass. Dyson read:\r\n\r\n              THE GOLD TIBERIUS,\r\n\r\nand his face flushed with fortune and the lust of the hunter.\r\n\r\nHe turned at once to the first leaf of the pocket-book, and proceeded to\r\nread with rapt interest the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE YOUNG MAN WITH SPECTACLES\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the filthy and obscure lodging, situated, I verily believe, in one\r\nof the foulest slums of Clerkenwell, I indite this history of a life\r\nwhich, daily threatened, cannot last for very much longer. Every day,\r\nnay, every hour, I know too well my enemies are drawing their nets\r\ncloser about me; even now, I am condemned to be a close prisoner in my\r\nsqualid room, and I know that when I go out I shall go to my\r\ndestruction. This history, if it chance to fall into good hands, may,\r\nperhaps, be of service in warning young men of the dangers and pitfalls\r\nthat most surely must accompany any deviation from the ways of\r\nrectitude.\r\n\r\nMy name is Joseph Walters. When I came of age I found myself in\r\npossession of a small but sufficient income, and I determined that I\r\nwould devote my life to scholarship. I do not mean the scholarship of\r\nthese days; I had no intention of associating myself with men whose\r\nlives are spent in the unspeakably degrading occupation of "editing"\r\nclassics, befouling the fair margins of the fairest books with idle and\r\nsuperfluous annotation, and doing their utmost to give a lasting\r\ndisgust of all that is beautiful. An abbey church turned to the base use\r\nof a stable or a bake-house is a sorry sight; but more pitiable still is\r\na masterpiece spluttered over with the commentator\'s pen, and his\r\nhideous mark "cf."\r\n\r\nFor my part I chose the glorious career of scholar in its ancient sense;\r\nI longed to possess encyclopaedic learning, to grow old amongst books, to\r\ndistil day by day, and year after year, the inmost sweetness of all\r\nworthy writings. I was not rich enough to collect a library, and I was\r\ntherefore forced to betake myself to the Reading-Room of the British\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\nO dim, far-lifted and mighty dome, Mecca of many minds, mausoleum of\r\nmany hopes, sad house where all desires fail. For there men enter in\r\nwith hearts uplifted, and dreaming minds, seeing in those exalted stairs\r\na ladder to fame, in that pompous portico the gate of knowledge; and\r\ngoing in, find but vain vanity, and all but in vain. There, when the\r\nlong streets are ringing, is silence, there eternal twilight, and the\r\nodor of heaviness. But there the blood flows thin and cold, and the\r\nbrain burns adust; there is the hunt of shadows, and the chase of\r\nembattled phantoms; a striving against ghosts, and a war that has no\r\nvictory. O dome, tomb of the quick; surely in thy galleries where no\r\nreverberant voice can call, sighs whisper ever, and mutterings of dead\r\nhopes; and there men\'s souls mount like moths towards the flame, and\r\nfall scorched and blackened beneath thee, O dim, far-lifted, and mighty\r\ndome.\r\n\r\nBitterly do I now regret the day when I took my place at a desk for the\r\nfirst time, and began my studies. I had not been an habitue of the place\r\nfor many months, when I became acquainted with a serene and benevolent\r\ngentleman, a man somewhat past middle age, who nearly always occupied a\r\ndesk next to mine. In the Reading-Room it takes little to make an\r\nacquaintance, a casual offer of assistance, a hint as to the search in\r\nthe catalogue, and the ordinary politeness of men who constantly sit\r\nnear each other; it was thus I came to know the man calling himself Dr.\r\nLipsius. By degrees I grew to look for his presence, and to miss him\r\nwhen he was away, as was sometimes the case, and so a friendship sprang\r\nup between us. His immense range of learning was placed freely at my\r\nservice; he would often astonish me by the way in which he would sketch\r\nout in a few minutes the bibliography of a given subject, and before\r\nlong I had confided to him my ambitions.\r\n\r\n"Ah," he said, "you should have been a German. I was like that myself\r\nwhen I was a boy. It is a wonderful resolve, an infinite career. \'I will\r\nknow all things;\' yes, it is a device indeed. But it means this--a life\r\nof labor without end, and a desire unsatisfied at last. The scholar has\r\nto die, and die saying, \'I know very little.\'"\r\n\r\nGradually, by speeches such as these, Lipsius seduced me: he would\r\npraise the career, and at the same time hint that it was as hopeless as\r\nthe search for the philosopher\'s stone, and so by artful suggestions,\r\ninsinuated with infinite address, he by degrees succeeded in undermining\r\nall my principles. "After all," he used to say, "the greatest of all\r\nsciences, the key to all knowledge, is the science and art of pleasure.\r\nRabelais was perhaps the greatest of all the encyclopaedic scholars; and\r\nhe, as you know, wrote the most remarkable book that has ever been\r\nwritten. And what does he teach men in this book? Surely, the joy of\r\nliving. I need not remind you of the words, suppressed in most of the\r\neditions, the key of all the Rabelaisian mythology, of all the enigmas\r\nof his grand philosophy, _Vivez joyeux_. There you have all his\r\nlearning; his work is the institutes of pleasure as the fine art; the\r\nfinest art there is; the art of all arts. Rabelais had all science, but\r\nhe had all life too. And we have gone a long way since his time. You are\r\nenlightened, I think; you do not consider all the petty rules and\r\nby-laws that a corrupt society has made for its own selfish convenience\r\nas the immutable decrees of the eternal."\r\n\r\nSuch were the doctrines that he preached; and it was by such insidious\r\narguments, line upon line, here a little and there a little, that he at\r\nlast succeeded in making me a man at war with the whole social system. I\r\nused to long for some opportunity to break the chains and to live a free\r\nlife, to be my own rule and measure. I viewed existence with the eyes of\r\na pagan, and Lipsius understood to perfection the art of stimulating the\r\nnatural inclinations of a young man hitherto a hermit. As I gazed up at\r\nthe great dome I saw it flushed with the flames and colors of a world of\r\nenticement, unknown to me, my imagination played me a thousand wanton\r\ntricks, and the forbidden drew me as surely as a loadstone draws on\r\niron. At last my resolution was taken, and I boldly asked Lipsius to be\r\nmy guide.\r\n\r\nHe told me to leave the Museum at my usual hour, half past four, to walk\r\nslowly along the northern pavement of Great Russell Street, and to wait\r\nat the corner of the street till I was addressed, and then to obey in\r\nall things the instructions of the person who came up to me. I carried\r\nout these directions, and stood at the corner looking about me\r\nanxiously, my heart beating fast, and my breath coming in gasps. I\r\nwaited there for some time, and had begun to fear I had been made the\r\nobject of a joke, when I suddenly became conscious of a gentleman who\r\nwas looking at me with evident amusement from the opposite pavement of\r\nTottenham Court Road. He came over, and raising his hat, politely begged\r\nme to follow him, and I did so without a word, wondering where we were\r\ngoing, and what was to happen. I was taken to a house of quiet and\r\nrespectable aspect in a street lying to the north of Oxford Street, and\r\nmy guide rang the bell, and a servant showed us into a large room,\r\nquietly furnished, on the ground floor. We sat there in silence for some\r\ntime, and I noticed that the furniture, though unpretending, was\r\nextremely valuable. There were large oak-presses, two book-cases of\r\nextreme elegance, and in one corner a carved chest which must have been\r\nmediaeval. Presently Dr. Lipsius came in and welcomed me with his usual\r\nmanner, and after some desultory conversation, my guide left the room.\r\nThen an elderly man dropped in and began talking to Lipsius; and from\r\ntheir conversation I understood that my friend was a dealer in antiques;\r\nthey spoke of the Hittite seal, and of the prospects of further\r\ndiscoveries, and later, when two or three more persons had joined us,\r\nthere was an argument as to the possibility of a systematic exploration\r\nof the pre-celtic monuments in England I was; in fact, present at an\r\narchaeological reception of an informal kind; and at nine o\'clock, when\r\nthe antiquaries were gone, I stared at Lipsius in a manner that showed I\r\nwas puzzled, and sought an explanation.\r\n\r\n"Now," he said, "we will go upstairs."\r\n\r\nAs we passed up the stairs, Lipsius lighting the way with a hand-lamp, I\r\nheard the sound of a jarring lock and bolts and bars shot on at the\r\nfront door. My guide drew back a baize door, and we went down a passage,\r\nand I began to hear odd sounds, a noise of curious mirth, and then he\r\npushed me through a second door, and my initiation began. I cannot write\r\ndown what I witnessed that night; I cannot bear to recall what went on\r\nin those secret rooms fast shuttered and curtained so that no light\r\nshould escape into the quiet street; they gave me red wine to drink, and\r\na woman told me as I sipped it that it was wine of the Red Jar that\r\nAvallaunius had made. Another asked me how I liked the Wine of the\r\nFauns, and I heard a dozen fantastic names, while the stuff boiled in my\r\nveins, and stirred, I think, something that had slept within me from the\r\nmoment I was born. It seemed as if my self-consciousness deserted me; I\r\nwas no longer a thinking agent, but at once subject and object. I\r\nmingled in the horrible sport and watched the mystery of the Greek\r\ngroves and fountains enacted before me, saw the reeling dance, and heard\r\nthe music calling as I sat beside my mate, and yet I was outside it all,\r\nand viewed my own part an idle spectator. Thus with strange rites they\r\nmade me drink the cup, and when I woke up in the morning I was one of\r\nthem, and had sworn to be faithful. At first I was shown the enticing\r\nside of things. I was bidden to enjoy myself and care for nothing but\r\npleasure, and Lipsius himself indicated to me as the acutest enjoyment\r\nthe spectacle of the terrors of the unfortunate persons who were from\r\ntime to time decoyed into the evil house. But after a time it was\r\npointed out to me that I must take my share in the work, and so I found\r\nmyself compelled to be in my turn a seducer; and thus it is on my\r\nconscience that I have led many to the depths of the pit.\r\n\r\nOne day Lipsius summoned me to his private room, and told me that he had\r\na difficult task to give me. He unlocked a drawer, and gave me a sheet\r\nof type-written paper, and had me read it. It was without place, or\r\ndate, or signature, and ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n"Mr. James Headley, F.S.A., will receive from his agent in Armenia, on\r\nthe 12th inst., a unique coin, the gold Tiberius. It hears on the\r\nreverse a faun, with the legend VICTORIA. It is believed that this coin\r\nis of immense value. Mr. Headley will come up to town to show the coin\r\nto his friend, Professor Memys, of Chenies Street, Oxford Street, on\r\nsome date between the 13th and the 18th."\r\n\r\nDr. Lipsius chuckled at my face of blank surprise when I laid down this\r\nsingular communication.\r\n\r\n"You will have a good chance of showing your discretion," he said. "This\r\nis not a common case; it requires great management and infinite tact. I\r\nam sure I wish I had a Panurge in my service, but we will see what you\r\ncan do."\r\n\r\n"But is it not a joke?" I asked him. "How can you know, or rather how\r\ncan this correspondent of yours know that a coin has been despatched\r\nfrom Armenia to Mr. Headley? And how is it possible to fix the period in\r\nwhich Mr. Headley will take it into his head to come up to town? It\r\nseems to me a lot of guess work."\r\n\r\n"My dear Mr. Walters," he replied; "we do not deal in guess work here.\r\nIt would bore you if I went into all these little details, the cogs and\r\nwheels, if I may say so, which move the machine. Don\'t you think it is\r\nmuch more amusing to sit in front of the house and be astonished, than\r\nto be behind the scenes and see the mechanism? Better tremble at the\r\nthunder, believe me, than see the man rolling the cannon ball. But,\r\nafter all, you needn\'t bother about the how and why; you have your share\r\nto do. Of course, I shall give you full instructions, but a great deal\r\ndepends on the way the thing is carried out. I have often heard very\r\nyoung men maintain that style is everything in literature, and I can\r\nassure you that the same maxim holds good in our far more delicate\r\nprofession. With us style is absolutely everything, and that is why we\r\nhave friends like yourself."\r\n\r\nI went away in some perturbation; he had no doubt designedly left\r\neverything in mystery, and I did not know what part I should have to\r\nplay. Though I had assisted at scenes of hideous revelry, I was not yet\r\ndead to all echo of human feeling, and I trembled lest I should receive\r\nthe order to be Mr. Headley\'s executioner.\r\n\r\nA week later, it was on the sixteenth of the month, Dr. Lipsius made me\r\na sign to come into his room.\r\n\r\n"It is for to-night," he began. "Please to attend carefully to what I am\r\ngoing to say, Mr. Walters, and on peril of your life, for it is a\r\ndangerous matter,--on peril of your life I say, follow these\r\ninstructions to the letter. You understand? Well, to-night at about\r\nhalf-past seven you will stroll quietly up the Hampstead Road till you\r\ncome to Vincent Street. Turn down here and walk along, taking the third\r\nturning to your right, which is Lambert Terrace. Then follow the\r\nterrace, cross the road, and go along Hertford Street, and so into\r\nLillington Square. The second turning you will come to in the square is\r\ncalled Sheen Street; but in reality it is more a passage between blank\r\nwalls than a street. Whatever you do, take care to be at the corner of\r\nthis street at eight o\'clock precisely. You will walk along it, and just\r\nat the bend, where you lose sight of the square, you will find an old\r\ngentleman with white beard and whiskers. He will in all probability be\r\nabusing a cabman for having brought him to Sheen Street instead of\r\nChenies Street. You will go up to him quietly and offer your services;\r\nhe will tell you where he wants to go, and you will be so courteous as\r\nto offer to show him the way. I may say that Professor Memys moved,\r\ninto Chenies Street a month ago; thus Mr. Headley has never been to see\r\nhim there, and moreover he is very short-sighted, and knows little of\r\nthe topography of London. Indeed he has quite lived the life of a\r\nlearned hermit at Audley Hall.\r\n\r\n"Well, need I say more to a man of your intelligence? You will bring him\r\nto this house; he will ring the bell, and a servant in quiet livery will\r\nlet him in. Then your work will be done, and I am sure done well. You\r\nwill leave Mr. Headley at the door, and simply continue your walk, and I\r\nshall hope to see you the next day. I really don\'t think there is\r\nanything more I can tell you."\r\n\r\nThese minute instructions I took care to carry out to the letter. I\r\nconfess that I walked up the Tottenham Court Road by no means blindly,\r\nbut with an uneasy sense that I was coming to a decisive point in my\r\nlife. The noise and rumor of the crowded pavements were to me but\r\ndumb-show. I revolved again and again in ceaseless iteration the task\r\nthat had been laid on me, and I questioned myself as to the possible\r\nresults. As I got near the point of turning, I asked myself whether\r\ndanger were not about my steps; the cold thought struck me that I was\r\nsuspected and observed, and every chance foot-passenger who gave me a\r\nsecond glance seemed to me an officer of police. My time was running\r\nout, the sky had darkened, and I hesitated, half resolved to go no\r\nfarther, but to abandon Lipsius and his friends forever. I had almost\r\ndetermined to take this course, when the conviction suddenly came to me\r\nthat the whole thing was a gigantic joke, a fabrication of rank\r\nimprobability. Who could have procured the information about the\r\nArmenian agent, I asked myself. By what means could Lipsius have known\r\nthe particular day, and the very train that Mr. Headley was to take? How\r\nengage him to enter one special cab amongst the dozens waiting at\r\nPaddington? I vowed it a mere Milesian tale, and went forward merrily,\r\nand turned down Vincent Street, and threaded out the route that Lipsius\r\nhad so carefully impressed upon me. The various streets he had named\r\nwere all places of silence and an oppressive cheap gentility; it was\r\ndark, and I felt alone in the musty squares and crescents, where people\r\npattered by at intervals, and the shadows were growing blacker. I\r\nentered Sheen Street, and found it, as Lipsius had said, more a passage\r\nthan a street; it was a by-way, on one side a low wall and neglected\r\ngardens and grim backs of a line of houses, and on the other a timber\r\nyard. I turned the corner, and lost sight of the square, and then to my\r\nastonishment I saw the scene of which I had been told. A hansom cab had\r\ncome to a stop beside the pavement, and an old man carrying a handbag\r\nwas fiercely abusing the cabman, who sat on his perch the image of\r\nbewilderment.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I\'m sure you said Sheen Street, and that\'s where I brought\r\nyou," I heard him saying, as I came up, and the old gentleman boiled in\r\na fury, and threatened police and suits at law.\r\n\r\nThe sight gave me a shock; and in an instant I resolved to go through\r\nwith it. I strolled on, and without noticing the cabman, lifted my hat\r\npolitely to old Mr. Headley.\r\n\r\n"Pardon me, sir," I said, "but is there any difficulty? I see you are a\r\ntraveller; perhaps the cabman has made a mistake. Can I direct you?"\r\n\r\nThe old fellow turned to me, and I noticed that he snarled and showed\r\nhis teeth like an ill-tempered cur as he spoke.\r\n\r\n"This drunken fool has brought me here," he said. "I told him to drive\r\nto Chenies Street, and he brings me to this infernal place. I won\'t pay\r\nhim a farthing, and I meant to have given him a handsome sum. I am going\r\nto call for the police and give him in charge."\r\n\r\nAt this threat the cabman seemed to take alarm. He glanced round as if\r\nto make sure that no policeman was in sight and drove off grumbling\r\nloudly, and Mr. Headley grinned, savagely with satisfaction at having\r\nsaved his fare, and put back one and sixpence into his pocket, the\r\n"handsome sum" the cabman had lost.\r\n\r\n"My dear sir," I said, "I am afraid this piece of stupidity has annoyed\r\nyou a great deal. It is a long way to Chenies Street, and you will have\r\nsome difficulty in finding the place unless you know London pretty\r\nwell."\r\n\r\n"I know it very little," he replied. "I never come up except on\r\nimportant business, and I\'ve never been to Chenies Street in my life."\r\n\r\n"Really? I should be happy to show you the way. I have been for a\r\nstroll, and it will not at all inconvenience me to take you to your\r\ndestination."\r\n\r\n"I want to go to Professor Memys, at number 15. It\'s most annoying to\r\nme. I\'m short-sighted, and I can never make out the numbers on the\r\ndoors."\r\n\r\n"This way if you please," I said, and we set out.\r\n\r\nI did not find Mr. Headley an agreeable man; indeed, he grumbled the\r\nwhole way. He informed me of his name, and I took care to say, "The\r\nwell-known antiquary?" and thenceforth I was compelled to listen to the\r\nhistory of his complicated squabbles with publishers, who had treated\r\nhim, as he said, disgracefully. The man was a chapter in the\r\nIrritability of Authors. He told me that he had been on the point of\r\nmaking the fortune of several firms, but had been compelled to abandon\r\nthe design owing to their rank ingratitude. Besides these ancient\r\nhistories of wrong and the more recent misadventure of the cabman, he\r\nhad another grievous complaint to make. As he came along in the train,\r\nhe had been sharpening a pencil, and the sudden jolt of the engine as it\r\ndrew up at a station had driven the penknife against his face,\r\ninflicting a small triangular wound just on the cheek-bone, which he\r\nshowed me. He denounced the railway company, and heaped imprecations on\r\nthe head of the driver, and talked of claiming damages. Thus he grumbled\r\nall the way, not noticing in the least where he was going, and so\r\ninamiable did his conduct appear to me that I began to enjoy the trick I\r\nwas playing on him.\r\n\r\nNevertheless my heart beat a little faster as we turned into the street\r\nwhere Lipsius was waiting. A thousand accidents, I thought, might\r\nhappen. Some chance might bring one of Headley\'s friends to meet us;\r\nperhaps, though he knew not Chenies Street, he might know the street\r\nwhere I was taking him; in spite of his short-sight he might possibly\r\nmake out the number, or in a sudden fit of suspicion he might make an\r\ninquiry of the policeman at the corner. Thus every step upon the\r\npavement, as we drew nearer to the goal, was to me a pang and a terror,\r\nand every approaching passenger carried a certain threat of danger. I\r\ngulped down my excitement with an effort, and made shift to say pretty\r\nquietly:--\r\n\r\n"No. 15, I think you said? That is the third house from this. If you\r\nwill allow me, I will leave you now; I have been delayed a little, and\r\nmy way lies on the other side of Tottenham Court Road."\r\n\r\nHe snarled out some kind of thanks, and I turned my back and walked\r\nswiftly in the opposite direction. A minute or two later, I looked round\r\nand saw Mr. Headley standing on the doorstep, and then the door opened\r\nand he went in. For my part I gave a sigh of relief, and hastened to get\r\naway from the neighborhood and endeavored to enjoy myself in merry\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the next day I kept away from Lipsius. I felt anxious, but\r\nI did not know what had happened or what was happening, and a reasonable\r\nregard for my own safety told me that I should do well to remain quietly\r\nat home. My curiosity, however, to learn the end of the odd drama in\r\nwhich I had played a part stung me to the quick, and late in the evening\r\nI made up my mind to go and see how events had turned out. Lipsius\r\nnodded when I came in, and asked me if I could give him five minutes\'\r\ntalk. We went into his room, and he began to walk up and down, and I sat\r\nwaiting for him to speak.\r\n\r\n"My dear Mr. Walters," he said at length, "I congratulate you warmly.\r\nYour work was done in the most thorough and artistic manner. You will go\r\nfar. Look."\r\n\r\nHe went to his escritoire and pressed a secret spring, and a drawer flew\r\nout, and he laid something on the table. It was a gold coin, and I took\r\nit up and examined it eagerly, and read the legend about the figure of\r\nthe faun.\r\n\r\n"Victoria," I said, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was a great capture, which we owe to you. I had great\r\ndifficulty in persuading Mr. Headley that a little mistake had been\r\nmade; that was how I put it. He was very disagreeable, and indeed\r\nungentlemanly about it; didn\'t he strike you as a very cross old man?"\r\n\r\nI held the coin, admiring the choice and rare design, clear cut as if\r\nfrom the mint; and I thought the fine gold glowed and burned like a\r\nlamp.\r\n\r\n"And what finally became of Mr. Headley?" I said at last.\r\n\r\nLipsius smiled and shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"What on earth does it matter?" he said. "He might be here, or there, or\r\nanywhere; but what possible consequence could it be? Besides, your\r\nquestion rather surprises me. You are an intelligent man, Mr. Walters.\r\nJust think it over, and I\'m sure you won\'t repeat the question."\r\n\r\n"My dear sir," I said, "I hardly think you are treating me fairly. You\r\nhave paid me some handsome compliments on my share in the capture, and I\r\nnaturally wish to know how the matter ended. From what I saw of Mr.\r\nHeadley, I should think you must have had some difficulty with him."\r\n\r\nHe gave me no answer for the moment, but began again to walk up and down\r\nthe room, apparently absorbed in thought.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said at last, "I suppose there is something in what you say.\r\nWe are certainly indebted to you. I have said, that I have a high\r\nopinion of your intelligence, Mr. Walters. Just look here, will you."\r\n\r\nHe opened a door communicating with another room and pointed.\r\n\r\nThere was a great box lying on the floor; a queer coffin-shaped thing. I\r\nlooked at it and saw it was a mummy case like those in the British\r\nMuseum, vividly painted in the brilliant Egyptian colors, with I knew\r\nnot what proclamation of dignity or hopes of life immortal. The mummy,\r\nswathed about in the robes of death, was lying within, and the face had\r\nbeen uncovered.\r\n\r\n"You are going to send this away?" I said, forgetting the question I had\r\nput.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I have an order from a local museum. Look a little more closely,\r\nMr. Walters."\r\n\r\nPuzzled by his manner, I peered into the face, while he held up the\r\nlamp. The flesh was black with the passing of the centuries; but as I\r\nlooked I saw upon the right cheek-bone a small triangular scar, and the\r\nsecret of the mummy flashed upon me. I was looking at the dead body of\r\nthe man whom I had decoyed into that house.\r\n\r\nThere was no thought or design of action in my mind. I held the accursed\r\ncoin in my hand, burning me with a foretaste of hell, and I fled as I\r\nwould have fled from pestilence and death, and dashed into the street\r\nin blind horror, not knowing where I went. I felt the gold coin grasped\r\nin my clenched list, and threw it away, I knew not where, and ran on and\r\non through by-streets and dark ways, till at last I issued out into a\r\ncrowded thoroughfare, and checked myself. Then, as consciousness\r\nreturned, I realized my instant peril, and understood what would happen\r\nif I fell into the hands of Lipsius. I knew that I had put forth my\r\nfinger to thwart a relentless mechanism rather than a man; my recent\r\nadventure with the unfortunate Mr. Headley had taught me that Lipsius\r\nhad agents in all quarters, and I foresaw that if I fell into his hands,\r\nhe would remain true to his doctrine of style, and cause me to die a\r\ndeath of some horrible and ingenious torture. I bent my whole mind to\r\nthe task of outwitting him and his emissaries, three of whom I knew to\r\nhave proved their ability for tracking down persons who for various\r\nreasons preferred to remain obscure. These servants of Lipsius were two\r\nmen and a woman, and the woman was incomparably the most subtle and the\r\nmost deadly. Yet I considered that I too had some portion of craft, and\r\nI took my resolve. Since then I have matched myself day by day and hour\r\nby hour against the ingenuity of Lipsius and his myrmidons. For a time I\r\nwas successful; though they beat furiously after me in the covert of\r\nLondon, I remained _perdu_, and watched with some amusement their\r\nfrantic efforts to recover the scent lost in two or three minutes. Every\r\nlure and wile was put forth to entice me from my hiding-place. I was\r\ninformed by the medium of the public prints that what I had taken had\r\nbeen recovered, and meetings were proposed in which I might hope to\r\ngain a great deal without the slightest risk. I laughed at their\r\nendeavors, and began a little to despise the organization I had so\r\ndreaded, and ventured more abroad. Not once or twice, but several times,\r\nI recognized the two men who were charged with my capture, and I\r\nsucceeded in eluding them easily at close quarters; and a little hastily\r\nI decided that I had nothing to dread, and that my craft was greater\r\nthan theirs. But in the mean while, while I congratulated myself on my\r\ncunning, the third of Lipsius\'s emissaries was weaving her nets, and in\r\nan evil hour I paid a visit to an old friend, a literary man named\r\nRussell, who lived in a quiet street in Bayswater. The woman, as I found\r\nout too late, a day or two ago, occupied rooms in the same house, and I\r\nwas followed and tracked down. Too late, as I have said, I recognized\r\nthat I had made a fatal mistake, and that I was besieged. Sooner or\r\nlater I shall find myself in the power of an enemy without pity; and so\r\nsurely as I leave this house I shall go to receive doom. I hardly dare\r\nto guess how it will at last fall upon me. My imagination, always a\r\nvivid one, paints to me appalling pictures of the unspeakable torture\r\nwhich I shall probably endure; and I know that I shall die with Lipsius\r\nstanding near and gloating over the refinements of my suffering and my\r\nshame.\r\n\r\nHours, nay, minutes, have become very precious to me. I sometimes pause\r\nin the midst of anticipating my tortures, to wonder whether even now I\r\ncannot hit upon some supreme stroke, some design of infinite subtlety,\r\nto free myself from the toils. But I find that the faculty of\r\ncombination has left me. I am as the scholar in the old myth, deserted\r\nby the power which has helped, me hitherto. I do not know when the\r\nsupreme moment will come, but sooner or later it is inevitable, and\r\nbefore long I shall receive sentence, and from the sentence to execution\r\nwill not be long.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI cannot remain here a prisoner any longer. I shall go out to-night when\r\nthe streets are full of crowds and clamors, and make a last effort to\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was with profound astonishment that Dyson closed the little book, and\r\nthought of the strange series of incidents which had brought him into\r\ntouch with the plots and counterplots connected with the Gold Tiberius.\r\nHe had bestowed the coin carefully away, and he shuddered at the bare\r\npossibility of its place of deposit becoming known to the evil band who\r\nseemed to possess such extraordinary sources of information.\r\n\r\nIt had grown late while he read, and he put the pocket-book away, hoping\r\nwith all his heart that the unhappy Walters might even at the eleventh\r\nhour escape the doom he dreaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVENTURE OF THE DESERTED RESIDENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n"A wonderful story, as you say; an extraordinary sequence and play of\r\ncoincidence. I confess that your expressions when you first showed me\r\nthe Gold Tiberius were not exaggerated. But do you think that Walters\r\nhas really some fearful fate to dread?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot say. Who can presume to predict events when life itself puts\r\non the robe of coincidence and plays at drama? Perhaps we have not yet\r\nreached the last chapter in the queer story. But, look, we are drawing\r\nnear to the verge of London; there are gaps, you see, in the serried\r\nranks of brick, and a vision of green fields beyond."\r\n\r\nDyson had persuaded the ingenious Mr. Phillipps to accompany him on one\r\nof those aimless walks to which he was himself so addicted. Starting\r\nfrom the very heart of London, they had made their way westward through\r\nthe stony avenues, and were now just emerging from the red lines of an\r\nextreme suburb, and presently the half-finished road ended, a quiet lane\r\nbegan, and they were beneath the shade of elm-trees. The yellow autumn\r\nsunlight that had lit up the bare distance of the suburban street now\r\nfiltered down through the boughs of the trees and shone on the glowing\r\ncarpet of fallen leaves, and the pools of rain glittered and shot back\r\nthe gleam of light. Over all the broad pastures there was peace and the\r\nhappy rest of autumn before the great winds begin, and afar off, London\r\nlay all vague and immense amidst the veiling mist; here and there a\r\ndistant window catching the sun and kindling with fire, and a spire\r\ngleaming high, and below the streets in shadow, and the turmoil of life.\r\nDyson and Phillipps walked on in silence beneath the high hedges, till\r\nat a turn of the lane they saw a mouldering and ancient gate standing\r\nopen, and the prospect of a house at the end of a moss-grown carriage\r\ndrive.\r\n\r\n"There is a survival for you," said Dyson; "it has come to its last\r\ndays, I imagine. Look how the laurels have grown gaunt, and weedy, and\r\nblack, and bare, beneath; look at the house, covered with yellow wash\r\nand patched with green damp. Why, the very notice-board which informs\r\nall and singular that the place is to be let has cracked and half\r\nfallen."\r\n\r\n"Suppose we go in and see it," said Phillipps. "I don\'t think there is\r\nanybody about."\r\n\r\nThey turned up the drive, and walked slowly, towards this remnant of old\r\ndays. It was a large straggling house, with curved wings at either end,\r\nand behind a series of irregular roofs and projections, showing that the\r\nplace had been added to at divers dates; the two wings were roofed in\r\ncupola fashion, and at one side, as they came nearer, they could see a\r\nstable-yard, and a clock turret with a bell, and the dark masses of\r\ngloomy cedars. Amidst all the lineaments of dissolution, there was but\r\none note of contrast: the sun was setting beyond the elm-trees, and all\r\nthe west and the south were in flames, and on the upper windows of the\r\nhouse the glow shone reflected, and it seemed as if blood and fire were\r\nmingled. Before the yellow front of the mansion, stained, as Dyson had\r\nremarked, with gangrenous patches, green and blackening, stretched what\r\nonce had been, no doubt, a well-kept lawn, but it was now rough and\r\nragged, and nettles and great docks, and all manner of coarse weeds,\r\nstruggled in the places of the flower-beds. The urns had fallen from\r\ntheir pillars beside the walk, and lay broken in shards upon the ground,\r\nand everywhere from grass-plot and path a fungoid growth had sprung up\r\nand multiplied, and lay dank and slimy like a festering sore upon the\r\nearth. In the middle of the rank grass of the lawn was a desolate\r\nfountain; the rim of the basin was crumbling and pulverized with decay,\r\nand within, the water stood stagnant, with green scum for the lilies\r\nthat had once bloomed there; and rust had eaten into the bronze flesh of\r\nthe Triton that stood in the middle, and the conch-shell he held was\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\n"Here," said Dyson, "one might moralize over decay and death. Here all\r\nthe stage is decked out with the symbols of dissolution; the cedarn\r\ngloom and twilight hangs heavy around us, and everywhere within the pale\r\ndankness has found a harbor, and the very air is changed and brought to\r\naccord with the scene. To me, I confess, this deserted house is as moral\r\nas a graveyard, and I find something sublime in that lonely Triton,\r\ndeserted in the midst of his water-pool. He is the last of the gods;\r\nthey have left him and he remembers the sound of water falling on water,\r\nand the days that were sweet."\r\n\r\n"I like your reflections extremely," said Phillipps, "but I may mention\r\nthat the door of the house is open.".\r\n\r\n"Let us go in then."\r\n\r\nThe door was just ajar, and they passed into the mouldy hall, and looked\r\nin at a room on one side. It was a large room, going far back, and the\r\nrich old red flock paper was peeling from the walls in long strips, and\r\nblackened with vague patches of rising damp; the ancient clay, the dank\r\nreeking earth rising up again, and subduing all the work of men\'s hands\r\nafter the conquest of many years. And the floor was thick with the dust\r\nof decay, and the painted ceiling fading from all gay colors and light\r\nfancies of cupids in a career, and disfigured with sores of dampness,\r\nseemed transmuted into other work. No longer the amorini chased one\r\nanother pleasantly, with limbs that sought not to advance, and hands\r\nthat merely simulated the act of grasping at the wreathed flowers, but\r\nit appeared some savage burlesque of the old careless world and of its\r\ncherished conventions, and the dance of the loves had become a dance of\r\nDeath; black pustules and festering sores swelled and clustered on fair\r\nlimbs, and smiling faces showed corruption, and the fairy blood had\r\nboiled with the germs of foul disease; it was a parable of the leaven\r\nworking, and worms devouring for a banquet the heart of the rose.\r\n\r\nStrangely, under the painted ceiling, against the decaying walls, two\r\nold chairs still stood alone, the sole furniture of the empty place.\r\nHigh-backed, with curving arms and twisted legs, covered with faded gold\r\nleaf, and upholstered in tattered damask, they too were a part of the\r\nsymbolism, and struck Dyson with surprise. "What have we here?" he said.\r\n"Who has sat in these chairs? Who, clad in peach-bloom satin, with lace\r\nruffles and diamond buckles, all golden, _a conte fleurettes_ to his\r\ncompanion? Phillipps, we are in another age. I wish I had some snuff to\r\noffer you, but failing that, I beg to offer you a seat, and we will sit\r\nand smoke tobacco. A horrid practice, but I am no pedant."\r\n\r\nThey sat down on the queer old chairs, and looked out of the dim and\r\ngrimy panes to the ruined lawn, and the fallen urns, and the deserted\r\nTriton.\r\n\r\nPresently Dyson ceased his imitation of eighteenth century airs; he no\r\nlonger pulled forward imaginary ruffles, or tapped a ghostly snuff-box.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a foolish fancy," he said at last, "but I keep thinking I hear a\r\nnoise like some one groaning. Listen; no, I can\'t hear it now. There it\r\nis again! Did you notice it, Phillipps?\r\n\r\n"No, I can\'t say I heard anything. But I believe that old places like\r\nthis are like shells from the shore, ever echoing with noises. The old\r\nbeams, mouldering piecemeal, yield a little and groan, and such a house\r\nas this I can fancy all resonant at night with voices, the voices of\r\nmatter so slowly and so surely transformed into other shapes; the voice\r\nof the worm that gnaws at last the very heart of the oak; the voice of\r\nstone grinding on stone, and the voice of the conquest of time."\r\n\r\nThey sat still in the old armchairs and grew graver in the musty ancient\r\nair,--the air of a hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like the place," said Phillipps, after a long pause. "To me it\r\nseems, as if there were a sickly, unwholesome smell about it, a smell of\r\nsomething burning."\r\n\r\n"You are right; there is an evil odor here. I wonder what it is! Hark!\r\nDid you hear that?"\r\n\r\nA hollow sound, a noise of infinite sadness and infinite pain broke in\r\nupon the silence; and the two men looked fearfully at one another,\r\nhorror and the sense of unknown things glimmering in their eyes.\r\n\r\n"Come," said Dyson, "we must see into this," and they went into the hall\r\nand listened in the silence.\r\n\r\n"Do you know," said Phillipps, "it seems absurd, but I could almost\r\nfancy that the smell is that of burning flesh."\r\n\r\nThey went up the hollow-sounding stairs, and the the odor became thick\r\nand noisome, stifling the breath; and a vapor, sickening as the smell of\r\nthe chamber of death, choked them. A door was open and they entered the\r\nlarge upper room, and clung hard to one another, shuddering at the sight\r\nthey saw.\r\n\r\nA naked man was lying on the floor, his arms and legs stretched wide\r\napart, and bound to pegs that had been hammered into the boards. The\r\nbody was torn and mutilated in the most hideous fashion, scarred with\r\nthe marks of red-hot irons, a shameful ruin of the human shape. But upon\r\nthe middle of the body a fire of coals was smouldering; the flesh had\r\nbeen burned through. The man was dead, but the smoke of his torment\r\nmounted still, a black vapor.\r\n\r\n"The young man with spectacles," said Mr. Dyson.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Three Impostors, by Arthur Machen\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE THREE IMPOSTORS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 35517.txt or 35517.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/3/5/5/1/35517/\r\n\r\nProduced by Marc D\'Hooghe at http://www.freeliterature.org\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
