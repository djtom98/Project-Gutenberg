This is an English\r\n     translation of the original German first edition from 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1\r\n\r\nIt was in a space in a thicket that he came into the world, in one of\r\nthose little, hidden places in the wood which seem to be open on every\r\nside but which in fact are completely surrounded by foliage. That is\r\nwhy there was so little room there, but just enough for him and his\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nHe stood up, he staggered on his thin legs as he wondered what was\r\nhappening, looked out with eyes which were dull, wondered what was\r\nhappening but saw nothing, dropped his head, shuddered severely, and\r\nwas quite numb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a beautiful child!\xe2\x80\x9d declared the magpie.\r\n\r\nShe had rushed to the place, drawn by the breathy groans she heard\r\nforced from Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother by her pain. Now the magpie sat on a branch\r\nnearby. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a beautiful child!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed again. No-one answered\r\nher and she continued speaking excitedly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he can already stand up\r\nand walk. That\xe2\x80\x99s amazing! That\xe2\x80\x99s so interesting! I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen\r\nanything like it in me life. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m still young of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonly a year since I left the nest, but I expect you know that. But I\r\nthink it\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful. A child like this ... he\xe2\x80\x99s only been born a\r\nsecond and he can already stand. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very noble of him. And\r\nmost of all, I find that everything done by you deer is very\r\nnoble. Can he already run too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother gently. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to\r\nexcuse me, I\xe2\x80\x99m not really in a good condition to chat with you.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot that I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do ... and besides, I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling quite\r\ntired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t let me disturb you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the magpie, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in a bit of a\r\nrush today, too! But it\xe2\x80\x99s not every day that you see something like\r\nthis. I ask you, think of how awkward it is for us in these things,\r\nand how much hard work! The children just can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything when they\r\nfirst hatch from the egg, they just lie there in the nest quite\r\nhelpless, and need to be looked after, they always need to be looked\r\nafter I tell you, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ve got no idea what it\xe2\x80\x99s like. It\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\nmuch hard work just to keep \xe2\x80\x98em fed, and they need to be protected,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s so worrying! I ask you, just think how strenuous all that is,\r\ngetting food for the children and having to watch over them at the\r\nsame time so that nothing happens to \xe2\x80\x98em; if you\xe2\x80\x99re not there they can\r\ndo nothing for themselves. Am I not right? And you have to wait so\r\nlong before they start to move, so long before they get their first\r\nfeathers and start to look a bit decent!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease forgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother said, \xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really listening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe magpie flew away. \xe2\x80\x9cStupid person,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cnoble,\r\nbut stupid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother barely noticed, and continued vigorously washing her\r\nnewborn. She washed it with her tongue and so performed several tasks\r\nat once, care for his body, a warming massage and a display of her\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nThe little one staggered a little under the weight of the stroking and\r\npushing that gently touched him all over but he remained still. His\r\nred coat, which was still a little unkempt, had a sprinkling of white\r\non it, his face, that of a child, still looked uncomprehending, almost\r\nas if he were in a deep sleep.\r\n\r\nAll around them grew hazel bushes, dogwoods, blackthorn bushes and\r\nyoung elder trees. Lofty maples, beech trees and oaks created a green\r\nroof over the thicket and from the firm, dark brown ground there\r\nsprouted ferns and wild peas and sage. Down close to the ground were\r\nthe leaves, close together, of violets which were already in bloom and\r\nthe leaves of strawberries which were just beginning to bloom. The\r\nlight of the morning sun pierced its way through the thick foliage\r\nlike a web of gold. The whole forest was alive with the sounds of\r\ncountless voices which pierced through the trees with an air of gay\r\nexcitement. The golden oriole performed a ceaseless song of joy, the\r\ndoves never stopped cooing, the blackbirds whistled, the finches\r\nflapped their wings, the tits chirruped. The quarrelsome screech of\r\nthe jay penetrated through all this, and the joking laughter of the\r\nblue magpie, the bursting, metallic cook-cook of the pheasants. From\r\ntime to time the harsh short celebrations of a woodpecker would pierce\r\nthrough all the other voices. The shrill, bright call of a falcon\r\nwould penetrate across the forest canopy and the choir of crows never\r\nstopped ringing out their raucous call.\r\n\r\nThe little one understood not a one of these many songs and calls, not\r\na word of their conversations. He was still too young to listen to\r\nthem. He also paid no attention to any of the many smells that the\r\nforest breathed. He heard only the gentle rustling that ran over his\r\ncoat as it was washed, warmed and kissed, and he smelt only the body\r\nof his mother, close by. He nuzzled close to this body with the lovely\r\nsmell, and hungrily he searched around it and found the source of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAs he drank his mother continued to pet him. \xe2\x80\x9cBambi,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\r\n\r\nEvery few moments she would lift her head, listen, and draw the wind\r\nin.\r\n\r\nThen she kissed her child again, reassured and happy. \xe2\x80\x9cBambi,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nrepeated, \xe2\x80\x9cmy little Bambi.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2\r\n\r\nNow, in the early summer, the trees stood still under the blue sky,\r\nthey held their arms out wide and received the power of the sun as it\r\nstreamed down on them. The bushes in the thicket were coming into\r\nbloom with stars of white or red or yellow. On many of them the buds\r\nof fruit were beginning to be seen again, countless many of them were\r\nsitting on the fine tips of the branches, tender and firm and resolute\r\nthey looked like little clenched fists. The colourful stars of many\r\ndifferent flowers came up out of the ground so that the earth, in the\r\nsubdued light of the forest, was a spray of silent but vigorous and\r\ngay colours. Everywhere there was the smell of the fresh foliage, of\r\nflowers, of the soil and of green wood. When morning broke, and when\r\nthe sun went down, the whole wood was alive with a thousand voices,\r\nand all day from morning to evening the bees sang, the wasps buzzed,\r\nand the bumble-bees buzzed even louder through the fragrant stillness.\r\n\r\nThat is what the days were like when Bambi experienced his earliest\r\nchildhood.\r\n\r\nHe followed his mother onto a narrow strip that led between the\r\nbushes. It was so pleasant to walk here! The dense foliage stroked his\r\nsides gently, and bent slightly to the side. Everywhere you looked the\r\npath seemed to be blocked and locked, but it was possible to go\r\nforward in the greatest comfort. There were routes like this in the\r\nwoods, they formed a network going all through the forest. Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother knew them all, and whenever he stood in front of what seemed to\r\nhim like an impenetrable green wall she would immediately seek out the\r\nplace where the path began.\r\n\r\nBambi asked her questions. He was very fond of asking his mother\r\nquestions. For him, it was the nicest thing in the world to keep\r\nasking her questions and to listen to whatever answer she gave. Bambi\r\nwas not at all surprised that he always thought of one question after\r\nanother to ask her. It seemed entirely natural to him; it was such a\r\ndelight for him. It was also a delight to wait, curious, until the\r\nanswer came, and whatever the answer was he was always satisfied with\r\nit. There were times, of course, when he did not understand the answer\r\nhe was given but that was nice too because he could always ask more\r\nquestions whenever he wanted to. Sometimes he stopped asking questions\r\nand that was nice too because then he was busy trying to understand\r\nwhat he had been told and would work it out in his own way. He often\r\nfelt certain that his mother had not given him a complete answer, that\r\nshe deliberately avoided saying everything she knew. And that was very\r\nnice, as it left behind a certain kind of curiosity still in him, a\r\nfeeling of something mysterious and pleasing that ran through him, an\r\nexpectation that made him uneasy but cheerful.\r\n\r\nNow he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWho owns this path, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis mother answered, \xe2\x80\x9cWe do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi continued asking. \xe2\x80\x9cYou and me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth of us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust you and me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother, \xe2\x80\x9cwe deer own it ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a deer?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bambi with a laugh.\r\n\r\nHis mother looked at him and laughed too. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a deer, and I\xe2\x80\x99m a\r\ndeer. That\xe2\x80\x99s what deer are. Do you understand now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi jumped into the air with laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I understand. I\xe2\x80\x99m a\r\nlittle deer and you\xe2\x80\x99re a big deer. That\xe2\x80\x99s right, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis mother nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cThere, you see now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi became serious again. \xe2\x80\x9cAre we the only ones, or are there other\r\ndeer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are lots of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are they?\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re here, they\xe2\x80\x99re all around us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut ... I can\xe2\x80\x99t see them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll see them soon enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity was so strong that he stopped walking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoon.\xe2\x80\x9d His mother walked calmly on.\r\n\r\nBambi followed her. He said nothing, for he was trying to work out\r\nwhat she could have meant by \xe2\x80\x9csoon.\xe2\x80\x9d He reached the conclusion that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csoon\xe2\x80\x9d was certainly not the same as \xe2\x80\x9cvery soon.\xe2\x80\x9d But he was not able\r\nto decide when it was that this \xe2\x80\x9csoon\xe2\x80\x9d would stop being \xe2\x80\x9csoon\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nstart to be \xe2\x80\x9ca long time yet.\xe2\x80\x9d Suddenly he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWho was it who made\r\nthis path?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\xa8\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe did,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother replied.\r\n\r\nBambi was astonished. \xe2\x80\x9cWe did? You and me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis mother said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes, ... we deer made it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat deer?\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll of us,\xe2\x80\x9d was his mother\xe2\x80\x99s curt reply.\r\n\r\nThey walked on. Bambi had had enough of it and wanted to jump off away\r\nfrom the path, but he was a good child and stayed with his\r\nmother. Ahead of them there was a rustling noise, coming from\r\nsomewhere close to the ground. There was something moving vigorously,\r\nsomething concealed under the ferns and wild lettuce. A little voice,\r\nas thin as a thread, let out a pitiful whistle, and then it was\r\nquiet. Only the leaves and the blades of grass quivered to show where\r\nit was that something had happened. A polecat had caught a mouse. Then\r\nhe dashed past them, crouched down to one side and set to on his meal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bambi excitedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother reassured him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut...\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi stuttered, \xe2\x80\x9cbut ... I saw it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut don\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened. A polecat\r\nkilled a mouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Bambi was terribly frightened. His heart was squeezed within a\r\ngreat, but unfamiliar, horror. It was a long time before he could\r\nspeak again. Then he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did he kill the mouse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause ...\xe2\x80\x9d His mother hesitated. Then she said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go a bit\r\nfaster, shall we?\xe2\x80\x9d as if she had suddenly thought of something else\r\nand forgotten about the question. She began to trot. Bambi hopped\r\nalong after her.\r\n\r\nA long pause went by and they had stopped walking so fast. Finally\r\nBambi, feeling rather anxious, asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWill we ever kill a mouse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bambi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, never,\xe2\x80\x9d came her reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bambi with some relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause we never kill anyone,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother told him simply.\r\n\r\nBambi became cheerful again.\r\n\r\nThere was a young ash tree next to their path from which a loud\r\nscreeching could be heard. His mother paid no attention to it and\r\ncarried on walking. But Bambi was curious and stopped. High in the\r\ntree\xe2\x80\x99s branches there were two jays squabbling over a nest they had\r\njust plundered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou get out of it, you lout!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t get excited, you fool,\xe2\x80\x9d the other answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid of\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and get your own nests, you thief!\xe2\x80\x9d yelled the first. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll punch\r\nyour face in.\xe2\x80\x9d He was beside himself. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re just vile,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsnapped. \xe2\x80\x9cJust vile!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other bird had noticed Bambi. He flapped a few twigs down and\r\nsnarled, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you looking at, brat? Get lost!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi felt intimidated and jumped away from them. Once he had reached\r\nhis mother he continued walking behind her along the path, obedient\r\nand startled. He thought she had not noticed he had stayed behind.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he asked her, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, what does \xe2\x80\x98vile\xe2\x80\x99 mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis mother said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi thought about it. And then he began again. \xe2\x80\x9cMother, why were\r\nthose two being so nasty to each other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis mother answered, \xe2\x80\x9cThey were quarrelling about getting the food.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWill we ever quarrel about food like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi asked.\r\n\r\nHis mother replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of food for all of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something else that Bambi wanted to know. \xe2\x80\x9cMother ...?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill we ever be nasty to each other too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my child,\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t do that sort of thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey carried on walking. Suddenly they saw light ahead of them, very\r\nbright light. The green confusion of bushes and shrubs came to an end,\r\ntheir path was at its end. Just a few steps further and they came out\r\ninto the brightly lit free space that opened up ahead of them. Bambi\r\nwanted to jump forward, but his mother just stood where she was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, impatient and quite enchanted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe meadow,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that, the meadow?\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi insisted.\r\n\r\nHis mother gave him a curt reply. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll see that for yourself soon\r\nenough.\xe2\x80\x9d She had become serious and attentive. She stood there without\r\nmoving, her head held up high, listening tensely, testing the wind\r\nwith deep breaths, and she looked almost severe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, everything\xe2\x80\x99s alright,\xe2\x80\x9d she finally said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe can go on out\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi was about to jump ahead but she blocked his way. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nyou wait until I call you.\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi did as he was told and immediately\r\nstood still. \xe2\x80\x9cWell done, Bambi,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother praised him. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, listen\r\ncarefully to what I say.\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi listened carefully as his mother spoke\r\nand saw how agitated she was, he became very tense himself. \xe2\x80\x9cGoing out\r\nonto the meadow is not as simple as it seems,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother continued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s difficult and it\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous. Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me why. You\xe2\x80\x99ll learn\r\nthat later on. For now, just do exactly what I tell you. Will you do\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi promised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. So I\xe2\x80\x99ll go out there first by myself. You stay here and wait.\r\nAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t take your eyes off me. Keep me in sight and don\xe2\x80\x99t look away,\r\nnot for a second. If you see me start to run back here, then turn\r\nround and run away as fast as you can. I\xe2\x80\x99ll soon catch up with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe became silent and seemed to be thinking, then, with much emphasis,\r\nshe went on. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever happens, run, run, run as fast as you can. Run\r\n... even if something happens ... even if you see ... if you see me\r\nfall to the ground ... don\xe2\x80\x99t pay any attention to me, understand?\r\n... Whatever you see or hear ... just keep going, without delay and as\r\nfast as you can ...! Do you promise me that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I call you,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother continued, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can come. You come and\r\nplay on the meadow. It\xe2\x80\x99s nice out there, you\xe2\x80\x99ll like it. Only ...\r\nthis is something else you have to promise me ... if I call you, you\r\nmust be at my side straight away. Whatever the circumstances! Do you\r\nhear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi, even quieter. His mother was being so serious.\r\n\r\nShe continued speaking. \xe2\x80\x9cOut there ... if I call you ... there\xe2\x80\x99s to be\r\nno running about and no questions, you\xe2\x80\x99re to run behind me like the\r\nwind! Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget. No thinking about it, no hesitating ... if I start\r\nto run it means you get up immediately and get out of there, and you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t stop till we\xe2\x80\x99re back here in the woods. You won\xe2\x80\x99t forget that,\r\nwill you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi, feeling rather anxious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlright, now I\xe2\x80\x99ll go,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother told him, and seemed somewhat\r\ncalmer.\r\n\r\nShe stepped out onto the meadow. Bambi, who did not take his eyes off\r\nher, saw how she went forward with slow and high steps. He stood there\r\nfull of anticipation, full of fear and curiosity. He saw how his\r\nmother listened on every side, he saw her when something startled her\r\nand felt startled himself, ready to jump back into the thicket. Then\r\nhis mother became calm once more and after a minute had passed she\r\nbecame cheerful. She lowered her neck, stretched it out far in front\r\nof her, looked contentedly back at Bambi and called, \xe2\x80\x9cCome on then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi jumped forward. He was gripped with an enormous joy that was so\r\nmagically strong that he forgot about the anxiety he had felt just\r\nbefore. All he had been able to see while he was in the thicket was\r\nthe green treetops above him, and he saw the few scraps of blue above\r\nthem only in short, rare glimpses. Now he could see the whole of the\r\nsky, high and wide and blue, and that made him glad, although he did\r\nnot know why. Among the trees, all he had seen of the sun had been\r\nsingle, broad rays, or the gentle scattering of golden light that\r\nplayed between the branches. Now he suddenly found himself standing in\r\na hot and dazzling power that forced itself on him, he stood within\r\nthis copious blessing of warmth that closed his eyes and opened his\r\nheart. Bambi was exhilarated; he was completely beside himself, it was\r\nsimply wonderful. He spontaneously jumped into the air, three times,\r\nfour times, five times on the spot where stood. He could not help\r\nhimself; he had to do it. Something yanked him up and made him\r\njump. His young limbs had such powerful spring in them, the air went\r\nso deep and easily into his lungs that he drank it in, drank in all\r\nthe fragrances of the meadow with so much overpowering cheer that he\r\nsimply had to jump. Bambi was a child. If he had been a human child he\r\nwould have shouted with joy. But he was a young deer, and deer cannot\r\nshout, or at least not in the same way as human children do. So he\r\nrejoiced in his own way. With his legs, with his whole body that threw\r\nhim into the air. His mother stood nearby and was glad to watch\r\nhim. She watched him going crazy. She saw him as he threw himself up\r\nhigh, dropped clumsily back down on the same spot, stared ahead in\r\nconfusion and exhilaration, and then, in the next moment, threw\r\nhimself back into the air over and over again. She understood that\r\nBambi had only ever seen the narrow deer paths in the woods, in the\r\nfew days of his existence had only ever become used to the narrowness\r\nof the thicket, and that he therefore did not move from the spot where\r\nhe stood because he still did not understand that he was free to run\r\naround the whole of the meadow. She stretched out her forelegs and\r\nlowered herself onto them, gave a little laugh to Bambi, and she was\r\nsuddenly away, rushing round in circles so that the tall grass swished\r\nloudly. Bambi was startled and remained motionless. Was that meant to\r\nmean he should go back into the woods? Don\xe2\x80\x99t bother about me, his\r\nmother had said, whatever you see, whatever you hear, just get away,\r\nget away as fast as you can! He wanted to turn round and run away as\r\nhe had been told. Then his mother suddenly came galloping towards him\r\nmaking a wonderful noise. She came to within two steps from him,\r\nlowered her body as she had done the first time, laughed to him and\r\ncalled, \xe2\x80\x9cTry and catch me!,\xe2\x80\x9d and rushed away from him. Bambi was\r\nastonished. What was all this supposed to mean? What had come over his\r\nmother all of a sudden? But then she was coming back again at such\r\nenormous speed it enough to make you dizzy. She poked him in the side\r\nwith her nose and quickly said, \xe2\x80\x9cTry and catch me!,\xe2\x80\x9d and rushed\r\naway. Bambi stumbled after her. A few steps. But those steps soon\r\nbecame little jumps. They carried him, he thought he was flying; they\r\ncarried him by themselves. There was space under his steps, space\r\nunder his jumps, space, space. Bambi was beside himself. The grass\r\nmade a glorious sound in his ears. It was deliciously soft, as tender\r\nas silk as he skimmed across it. His mother stood still for a while as\r\nshe caught her breath. She only moved in the direction of Bambi as he\r\nrushed by. Bambi flew like the wind.\r\n\r\nSuddenly it stopped. Bambi stopped running and went over to his mother\r\nin an elegant, high stepping trot, where he looked happily into her\r\nface. Then they walked along contentedly beside each other. Since he\r\nhad come out here into the open Bambi had seen the sky, the sun and\r\nthe wide stretch of green only with his body, only with a blinkered,\r\ndrunken glance at the sky, with the cosy feeling of the warmth on his\r\nback and the invigorating feel of the sun that made him take ever\r\ndeeper breaths. Now, for the first time, he began to enjoy the glory\r\nof the meadow with his eyes which surprised him with new wonders with\r\nevery step he took. There were no scraps of bare earth that could be\r\nseen as there were among the trees. Here every spot was covered in\r\ndense grass, every blade cuddling close with others which swelled up\r\nin abundant glory, leant gently to one side under each step and\r\nimmediately sprang back upright with no sense of insult. The broad\r\ngreen plain was starry with white daisies, with violets, with the\r\nthick red heads of the clover as it began to blossom, and with the\r\nshining majesty of the golden flowers held up high by the dandelions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d called Bambi, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a flower flying away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not a flower,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a butterfly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi was delighted and watched the butterfly as it very gently freed\r\nitself from a stalk of grass and, in tumbling flight, floated\r\naway. Now Bambi saw that there were many such butterflies flying in\r\nthe air over the meadow, they seemed to be in a hurry but they were\r\nslow, they tumbled up and down in a game that enchanted him. They\r\nreally did look like flowers moving about, gay flowers that did not\r\nwant to just keep still on their stalks and had got up to have a\r\nlittle dance. Or like flowers that had come down with the sun, still\r\nhad not found a place for themselves and were carefully looking round\r\nfor one, they would sink down and disappear as if they had already\r\nfound a place but then they would fly straight up again, just a little\r\nway at first, and then higher in order to carry on with their search,\r\nalways seeking because the best places were already occupied.\r\n\r\nBambi looked at all of them. He would have so liked to see one of them\r\nclose up, would have so liked to examine just one of them, but he was\r\nnot able to. They never stopped flitting about between each other. It\r\nmade him quite dizzy.\r\n\r\nWhen he once again looked down at the ground everything he saw brought\r\nhim a thousand delights, nimble, living things that flew up when he\r\nstepped near them. All around him there was something jumping and\r\nsprinkling into the air, something that became visible in a tumultuous\r\nswarm and, the next second sank back into the green ground it had come\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the little ones,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook,\xe2\x80\x9d called Bambi, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a piece of grass that\xe2\x80\x99s jumping up\r\n... it\xe2\x80\x99s jumping up so high!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat isn\xe2\x80\x99t grass,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s a nice grasshopper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy does it jump like that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bambi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause we\xe2\x80\x99re moving about,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother answered, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s frightened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi went over to the grasshopper, which was sitting right in\r\nthe white dish of a daisy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi politely, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be frightened, we\r\ncertainly won\xe2\x80\x99t do anything to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not frightened,\xe2\x80\x9d the grasshopper retorted in a rasping voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwas just a bit startled at first, as I was speaking to my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease excuse us for disturbing you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi modestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d the grasshopper rasped. \xe2\x80\x9cAs it\xe2\x80\x99s you it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmatter. But you never know who might be coming, and you have to watch\r\nout for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t been out here on the meadow before,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi told him. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nmother ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe grasshopper stood there with his head lowered in a way that made\r\nhim look very cross, his face looked serious and he grumbled, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\ninterested in that. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got the time to be here chatting with\r\nyou, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go and find my wife. Hop!\xe2\x80\x9d And he was gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHop,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi, rather puzzled and astonished at the height of the\r\nleap the grasshopper had made as he disappeared.\r\n\r\nBambi ran to his mother. \xe2\x80\x9cListen ... I\xe2\x80\x99ve just been talking with him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith who?\xe2\x80\x9d his mother asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, with the grasshopper,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi explained, \xe2\x80\x9cI was talking with\r\nhim. He was so friendly to me. And I liked him so much. He\xe2\x80\x99s so green,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful, and on his back you can see right through him, there\r\naren\xe2\x80\x99t any leaves like that, not even the finest leaf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was his wings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it?\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi continued speaking. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he\xe2\x80\x99s got such a serious face,\r\nas if he were thinking hard about something. But he was friendly to me\r\nanyway. And he can jump so high! That must be awfully hard. \xe2\x80\x9cHop!! he\r\nsaid, and he jumped so high that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see him any more.\r\n\r\nThey walked on. Bambi was very excited about his conversation with the\r\ngrasshopper, and he was a little tired as it was the first time he had\r\ntalked with a stranger. He was hungry, and pressed close to his mother\r\nso that he could refresh himself.\r\n\r\nThen, when he was once more standing there for a while, just staring\r\nahead of him in the sweet, little inebriation that always enveloped\r\nhim when he had drunk all he had wanted from his mother, he saw a\r\nwhitish flower down in the tangle of grass stems. It moved. Bambi\r\nlooked closer. No, that was not a flower, it was a butterfly. Bambi\r\ncrept closer.\r\n\r\nThe butterfly was hanging listlessly from a stem of grass, and gently\r\nmoved his wings about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, stay where you are,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi called to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I stay where I am? I am a butterfly, after all,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\nin astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, please stay where you are, just for a little while,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi begged\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been wanting to see you close up for so long now. Please be\r\nso kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlright then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little white butterfly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not for too\r\nlong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi stood in front of him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re so beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in\r\nenchantment, \xe2\x80\x9cso beautiful! Like a flower!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d The butterfly clapped his wings. \xe2\x80\x9cLike a flower? Well,\r\neveryone I know agrees that we\xe2\x80\x99re much more beautiful than flowers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi was confused at that. \xe2\x80\x9cY..yes, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d he stuttered, \xe2\x80\x9cmuch\r\nmore beautiful ... please forgive me ... I just wanted to say ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t really care what you wanted to say,\xe2\x80\x9d the butterfly\r\nretorted. He started to show off by curving his narrow body and\r\nplaying idly with his sensitive antennae.\r\n\r\nBambi was enthralled and continued to watch him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re so elegant,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cso fine and so elegant! And those white wings of yours,\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re so majestic!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe butterfly lay his wings wide open, then he put them together above\r\nhim where they looked like the taut sail of a yacht.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cnow I understand how you\xe2\x80\x99re more beautiful\r\nthan the flowers. And you can fly as well, flowers can\xe2\x80\x99t do that. They\r\nhave to stay where they\xe2\x80\x99re growing, that\xe2\x80\x99s how.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe butterfly raised himself up. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s enough now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\r\nfly!\xe2\x80\x9d And he lifted himself into the air with such ease that it could\r\nnot be seen and it could not be understood. His white wings moved\r\ngently and full of grace, and he was already drifting there in the air\r\nand the sunshine. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was only for your sake that I remained sitting\r\nthere for so long,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and he jiggled up and down in front of\r\nBambi, \xe2\x80\x9cbut now, I will fly away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was the meadow.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3\r\n\r\nDeep in among the trees was a place that belonged to Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother. It lay only a few steps from the narrow path used by the deer\r\nas they made their way through the wood but it was nearly impossible\r\nto find for anyone who did not know where the little gap through the\r\ndense bushes was.\r\n\r\nIt was only a narrow space, so narrow that it only just had room for\r\nBambi and his mother to fit in, and it was so low that when Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother stood up her head would be in among the twigs and\r\nbranches. Hazel bushes, gorse and dogwood all grew here tangled in\r\namong each other and the little sunlight that came down through the\r\nforest canopy would be caught by them so that it never reached as far\r\nas the ground. This was the room where Bambi came into the world and\r\nthis was where he and his mother made their home.\r\n\r\nNow, his mother lay asleep, pressed down on the ground. Bambi had\r\nslept a little too, but now he had become quite lively. He stood up\r\nand looked around.\r\n\r\nHere, deep in the woods, it was shadowy, it was almost dark. The wood\r\ncould be heard gently rustling and soughing. Here and there the tits\r\nchirruped, here and there was the bright laughter of a woodpecker or\r\nthe cheerless bark of a crow. All else, near and far, was quiet. Only\r\nthe air became warm in the heat of midday, and even that could be\r\nheard if you listened carefully. Here in the woods it was humid and\r\nsweltering.\r\n\r\nBambi looked down at his mother. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you asleep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo, his mother was not sleeping. She had woken up straight away when\r\nBambi had stood up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are we going to do now?\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother answered. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to stay where we are.\r\nJust lie down, like a good child, and go to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Bambi did not feel like sleeping. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on,\xe2\x80\x9d he begged. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go\r\nonto the meadow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis mother raised her head. \xe2\x80\x9cTo the meadow? Now ... to the meadow\r\n...?\xe2\x80\x9d She sounded so astonished and so full of alarm that Bambi became\r\nquite frightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t we go to the meadow now, then?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked shyly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d came his mother\xe2\x80\x99s answer, and it sounded quite conclusive. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nthat isn\xe2\x80\x99t possible right now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? asked Bambi as he became aware that there was something very\r\nstrange going on here. He became more afraid, but at the same time he\r\nfelt the urge to learn about everything. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t we go onto the\r\nmeadow now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll learn about all that later, when you\xe2\x80\x99re a bit older ...,\xe2\x80\x9d his\r\nmother reassured him.\r\n\r\nBambi was insistent. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy won\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLater,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re still just a little child,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued gently, \xe2\x80\x9cand you don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about things like this with\r\nlittle children.\xe2\x80\x9d She had become very serious. \xe2\x80\x9cNow ... on the meadow\r\n... I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to think of it. In broad daylight ...!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when we went on the meadow,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi objected, \xe2\x80\x9cit was broad\r\ndaylight then, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was different,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthat was early in the\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you only go there early in the morning then?\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi had become\r\ntoo inquisitive.\r\n\r\nHis mother remained patient. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly early in the morning or late in the\r\nevening ... or at night ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not in the daytime? Never ...?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis mother hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last, \xe2\x80\x9csometimes ... there\r\nare some of us who go out there in the daytime too, sometimes. But\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s under special conditions, ... I can\xe2\x80\x99t really explain it to you,\r\n... you\xe2\x80\x99re still too little, ... some go out there, but then they put\r\nthemselves in great danger ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it that\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous for them?\xe2\x80\x9d By now, Bambi was very\r\nexcited.\r\n\r\nBut his mother did not want to explain it straight away. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are in\r\ndanger ... listen, my child, these are things that you won\xe2\x80\x99t be able\r\nto grasp yet.\r\n\r\nBambi thought he would be able to understand anything, but he could\r\nnot understand why his mother did not want to give him more\r\ndetails. But he said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the way we have to live,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother went on, \xe2\x80\x9call of us.\r\nEven if we love the daytime ... and children are especially fond of\r\nthe daytime ... we have to live like this, we just have to accept\r\nit. We can only move about from the evening until the morning. Can you\r\nunderstand that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, my child, that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have to stay here, where we are now.\r\nThis is where we\xe2\x80\x99re safe. That\xe2\x80\x99s all there is to it! So now, lie down\r\nagain and go to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Bambi did not want to lie down again. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes us safe where we\r\nare now?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause all the bushes are watching over us, because the twigs on the\r\nbushes rustle, because the rough brushwood on the ground cracks and\r\ngives us warning, because the dead leaves from last year lie on the\r\nground and rustle to give us a sign, ... because the jays are there,\r\nthe magpies too, they keep watch over us, and that\xe2\x80\x99s how we know\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s somebody coming a long time before they reach us ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi enquired, \xe2\x80\x9cthe dead leaves from last year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and sit beside me,\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you all about\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi gladly went and sat beside her and snuggled in close while\r\nshe explained to him that the trees do not stay green all the time,\r\nthat the sunshine and the lovely warmth go away. Then it gets cold,\r\nthe leaves turn yellow because of the frost, they go brown and red\r\nand, one by one, they fall off the trees so that they and the bushes\r\nreach their naked branches to the sky and look completely forlorn. But\r\nthe dead leaves lie on the ground, and when they\xe2\x80\x99re disturbed by\r\nsomebody\xe2\x80\x99s foot they rustle: There\xe2\x80\x99s someone coming! Oh they\xe2\x80\x99re very\r\ngood, these dead leaves from last year. They do us a good service by\r\nbeing so eager and by keeping watch the way they do. And now, in the\r\nmiddle of summer, there are still lots of them hidden under the things\r\ngrowing on the ground and they warn about any danger long before it\r\ngets near.\r\n\r\nBambi pressed close against his mother. He forgot all about the\r\nmeadow. It was so cosy to sit here and listen to what his mother told\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThen, when his mother stopped speaking, he thought about what she had\r\nsaid. He thought it was very nice of the good, old leaves to watch\r\nover them so carefully even though they were dead and had been frozen\r\nand had gone through so many things already. He tried to think what\r\nthat danger, that his mother kept talking about, could actually\r\nbe. But all that thinking tired him out; it was all quiet around him,\r\nall you could hear was the heat of the air. And he went to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4\r\n\r\nOne evening, when he went back out onto the meadow with his mother, he\r\nthought he knew by now about everything that could be seen or heard\r\nthere. But it turned out that he still did know as much as he had\r\nthought .\r\n\r\nAt first, everything was the same as his first time there. His mother\r\nallowed Bambi to play tag with him. He ran round in circles, and the\r\nwide open space, the lofty sky and the freedom of the air were all so\r\nexhilarating that he rushed about with joy. After a time he noticed\r\nthat his mother was standing still. He stopped suddenly as he was\r\nturning, so suddenly that his four legs were spread wide apart. He\r\njumped high into the air so that his sudden halt would be more\r\ndignified, and now he was standing properly. His mother, a little way\r\naway seemed to be talking with someone but he could not make out, in\r\nthe long grass, who that could be. Curious, Bambi went closer. There,\r\nin the tangle of grass stems close in to his mother, there were two\r\nlong ears twitching. They were greyish-brown, and the black stripes on\r\nthem made them quite pretty. Bambi hesitated, but his mother said to\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cCome here Bambi, this is our friend, the hare. Come on then, let\r\nhim see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi went up to her straight away. There sat the hare, and very\r\nhonest he looked. His long ears rose in powerful grandeur high above\r\nhis head, and then they fell back down and hung limply as if they had\r\nbeen suddenly transformed into something weak. When Bambi saw the\r\nhare\xe2\x80\x99s whiskers, which extended stiff and straight all around his\r\nmouth, he began to think about them. But he noticed that the hare had\r\na very gently face, all his features seemed to indicate a good nature,\r\nand his big round eyes looked modestly out at the world. He really did\r\nlook like a friend, this hare. The thoughts that had flickered through\r\nBambi\xe2\x80\x99s head disappeared immediately. Remarkably enough, and just as\r\nquickly, he even lost all the respect that he had felt at first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, young sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hare with carefully chosen\r\npoliteness.\r\n\r\nBambi merely nodded \xe2\x80\x9cGood evening\xe2\x80\x9d back to him. He did not know why,\r\nbut all he did was nod. Very friendly, very nicely, though perhaps a\r\nlittle condescending. There was no other way he could do it. Perhaps\r\nit was something he was born with.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a handsome young prince!\xe2\x80\x9d said the hare to Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother. He\r\nlooked at Bambi carefully as he raised one of his ears high into the\r\nair, and then, soon after, the other ear, and then,soon after again,\r\nboth of them, and sometimes he would let them drop suddenly and hang\r\nlimply. Bambi did not like this. This gesture seemed to be saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, not worth it\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\nThe hare continued gently to examine Bambi with his big, round\r\neyes. His nose and his mouth, surrounded by its magnificent whiskers,\r\nwere in continual movement, like the way someone\xe2\x80\x99s nose and lips will\r\ntwitch when he is trying hard not to sneeze. Bambi could not help\r\nlaughing, and the hare immediately and with good will joined in with\r\nthe laughter, only his eyes became more thoughtful. \xe2\x80\x9cI congratulate\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother, \xe2\x80\x9cI sincerely congratulate you on\r\nhaving a son like this. Yes, yes, yes ... he will be a majestic prince\r\none day ... yes, yes, yes, you can see that at first glance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe raised himself upright, and now sat erect on his back legs, which\r\nastonished Bambi immensely. After he had had a good look all around,\r\nhis ears erect and his nose moving vigorously, he sat politely back\r\ndown on all fours. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease give my regards to the honourable\r\ngentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have many different things to do this\r\nevening. Please give them my humble regards.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned around and\r\nhopped away, his ears pressed down on his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodbye,\xe2\x80\x9d called Bambi to him as he went.\r\n\r\nHis mother smiled: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a good hare, so simple and so modest. It is\r\nnot easy for him in this world either.\xe2\x80\x9d There was sympathy in her\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nBambi walked around a little, allowing his mother to eat her food. He\r\nhoped he would come across them who he had met earlier, and would also\r\nhave liked to make some new acquaintances. It was not entirely clear\r\nto him what he was missing, but he always felt he was waiting for\r\nsomething. Suddenly he heard a gentle rustling from far across the\r\nmeadow, and felt slight, rapid knocking in the ground. He looked\r\nup. Over where the woods began there was something that flitted\r\nthrough the grass. There was a ... no ... there were two of them!\r\nBambi glanced at his mother, but she did not seem to be worried about\r\nanything and had her head deep in the grass. But at the other side of\r\nthe meadow there was something rushing round in circles, just as he\r\nhad been doing himself earlier on. Bambi was so astonished that he\r\nleapt backwards, as if he meant to run away. His mother noticed him\r\nand raised her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d she called.\r\n\r\nBut Bambi was speechless, he could find no words and merely stammered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTh .. there...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis mother looked in that direction. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I see,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\ncousin and you\xe2\x80\x99re right, she has a little child too, ... no, she has\r\ntwo.\xe2\x80\x9d His mother had spoken cheerfully, but now she became serious:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo ... Ena with two children .. really, she has two ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi stood and stared. Over there he could now see a figure, a figure\r\nthat looked just like his mother. He had not noticed her before. Now\r\nhe could see two things that continued moving in circles in the grass,\r\nbut only their red backs could be seen, thin red stripes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on,\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go over to them. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have some\r\ncompany there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi wanted to run there, but his mother only walked slowly, looking\r\nall around her with each step, so Bambi held himself back. He was very\r\nexcited though, and very impatient.\r\n\r\nHis mother continued speaking. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought we\xe2\x80\x99d come across Ena again\r\nsome time. Now, where\xe2\x80\x99s she hiding? I knew she had a child too. That\r\nwas easy to guess, but two children ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had long been spotted by the others, who now were coming towards\r\nthem. Bambi had to say hello to his aunt, but he had eyes only for her\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nHis aunt was very friendly. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to him. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, that\xe2\x80\x99s Gobo\r\nand that\xe2\x80\x99s Faline. You can all play together any time you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe children stood stiffly, without moving, and stared at each\r\nother. Gobo close beside Faline and Bambi in front of them. None of\r\nthem moved. They stood and gaped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll soon all be friends!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a nice-looking child,\xe2\x80\x9d Ena responded. \xe2\x80\x9cReally, very nice\r\nindeed. So strong, and with such good posture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s alright,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother said modestly. We have to be satisfied\r\nwith that. But Ena, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got two children!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what happens now and again,\xe2\x80\x9d Ena explained. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you do\r\nknow, my dear, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had many children before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBambi is my first,\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d Ena reassured her, \xe2\x80\x9cit might be different for you too\r\nthe next time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe children were still standing there and watching each other. None\r\nof them said a word. Faline suddenly jumped and dashed away. The whole\r\nthing had become too boring for her.\r\n\r\nIn an instant, Bambi ran after her, and Gobo did the same. The rushed\r\naround in semi-circles, they turned round as quick as a flash, they\r\ntumbled over each other, they chased each other up and down. It was\r\nwonderful fun. When they suddenly stopped, a little short of breath,\r\nthey were all good friends with each other. They began to talk.\r\n\r\nBambi told them about how he had spoken with the good little\r\ngrasshopper and the whiting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been talking with the shiny beetle too?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Faline.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo, Bambi had never spoken with the shiny beetle. He did not know him\r\nat all, he did not know who it might be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI often talk with him,\xe2\x80\x9d Faline explained, slightly boastfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was told off by the jay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gobo in amazement. \xe2\x80\x9cThe jay was as cheeky with you as\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d Gobo was often in amazement at things, and he was exceptionally\r\nmodest. \xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cthe hedgehog pricked me in the nose.\xe2\x80\x9d But\r\nhe only mentioned that in passing, as it were.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is the hedgehog?\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi asked cheerfully. It felt so wonderful to\r\nbe standing there, to have friends and to be hearing so many exciting\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hedgehog is a terrible creature,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Faline. \xe2\x80\x9cCovered in\r\nbig spikes all over his body ... and he\xe2\x80\x99s very spiteful too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really think he\xe2\x80\x99s spiteful?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gobo. \xe2\x80\x9cHe never does any\r\nharm to anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Faline quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t he prick you in the nose\r\nthen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that was only because I wanted to talk to him,\xe2\x80\x9d Gobo objected,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand it was only a little prick. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi went closer to Gobo. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did he not want you to talk to him\r\nthen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe never wants to talk to anyone,\xe2\x80\x9d Faline put in. \xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as anyone\r\ngets near him he rolls up into a ball with his spikes sticking out in\r\nevery direction. Our mother tells us he\xe2\x80\x99s one of those people who\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to have anything to do with the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he\xe2\x80\x99s just afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Gobo.\r\n\r\nBut Faline understood it better. \xe2\x80\x9cMother says you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nanything to do with people like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi suddenly asked Gobo. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what it is ... this danger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow the other two also became serious, and the three of them put their\r\nheads together. Gobo thought about it. He made a real effort to work\r\nit out as he could see that Bambi was very curious about the\r\nanswer. \xe2\x80\x9cThe danger ...\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cthe danger ... that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsomething very bad ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi insisted, \xe2\x80\x9cyes, something very bad ... but what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll three of them shuddered at the horror of it.\r\n\r\nFaline suddenly called out loudly and gaily, \xe2\x80\x9cThe danger is ... when\r\nyou have to run away from it.\xe2\x80\x9d She jumped away, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nstay there and feel afraid. Bambi and Gobo jumped straight after\r\nher. They started to play again and tumbled about in the green and\r\nrustling silk of the meadow where they soon forgot about that serious\r\nquestion. After a while they stopped and stood close to each other as\r\nthey had before and began to chat. They looked over to their\r\nmothers. They too were happily close to each other, eating a little\r\nand holding a gentle conversation.\r\n\r\nAuntie Ena lifted her head and called over to her children. \xe2\x80\x9cGobo!\r\nFaline! We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go soon ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother warned him too. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on Bambi, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh not yet,\xe2\x80\x9d Faline begged crossly. \xe2\x80\x9cJust a little bit longer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi begged too, \xe2\x80\x9cOh please, let\xe2\x80\x99s stay longer, it\xe2\x80\x99s so nice here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Gobo quietly repeated what they had said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so nice here\r\n...Just a little bit longer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three of them spoke at the same time.\r\n\r\nEna looked at Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother. \xe2\x80\x9cThere, what did I tell you? They\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nalready become inseparable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen something else happened, and it was something much bigger than\r\nall the other things that Bambi had experienced that day.\r\n\r\nA thumping and a stamping coming out of the woods could be felt all\r\nthrough ground. Branches of trees cracked, twigs rustled, and before\r\nanyone could even prick up his ears it broke its way out of the\r\nthicket. One of them with a rustling and a banging, the other in a\r\ngreat rush behind him. They ran forward like a storm wind, completed a\r\nbroad arch across the meadow, disappeared back into the woods where\r\nthey could be heard galloping, they hurtled once more out of the\r\nthicket and then they suddenly stopped and stood quietly, twenty paces\r\napart from each other.\r\n\r\nBambi looked at them and did not move. They looked a little like his\r\nmother and Auntie Ena. But on their heads there was a glittering crown\r\nof antlers made of brown pearls and bright white prongs. Bambi could\r\nnot move; he looked at one, and then at the other. One of them was\r\nsmaller than the other, and his crown was less developed too. But the\r\nother had a beauty that gave him an air of authority. He held his head\r\nhigh, and his crown was even higher. It sparkled from the darkness\r\ninto the light, it was adorned with the majesty of many black and\r\nbrown pearls, and the long, white tips glittered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Faline in amazement. Gobo repeated her quietly. Bambi,\r\nthough, said nothing at all. He was captivated and silent.\r\n\r\nThe two of them now began to move, getting further apart from each\r\nother as they went, each of them to a different side of the meadow and\r\nthere they went slowly back into the woods. The majestic figure came\r\nup quite close to the children, Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother and Auntie Ena. His\r\nstep showed a quiet glory, he held his noble head up high like a king\r\nand dignified no-one with as much as a glance. The children did not\r\ndare to breathe until he had disappeared back into the thicket. They\r\nlooked around, trying to see him, but just at that moment the green\r\ndoors of the wood closed behind him.\r\n\r\nFaline was the first to break the silence. \xe2\x80\x9cWho was that?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexclaimed. But her little, arrogant voice had a quake in it.\r\n\r\nIn a voice that could hardly be heard, Gobo repeated her: \xe2\x80\x9cWho was\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi was silent.\r\n\r\nAuntie Ena said joyfully, \xe2\x80\x9cThose were your fathers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing else was said, and the group moved apart.\r\n\r\nAuntie Ena went with her children into the nearest patch of\r\nundergrowth. That was the way they always went. Bambi and his mother\r\nhad to go right across the meadow to the oak tree to get to the route\r\nthey usually took. For a long time he remained silent until finally he\r\nasked, \xe2\x80\x9cDid they not see us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis mother understood what he meant, and replied, \xe2\x80\x9cOf course they saw\r\nus. They see everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi felt shy, and did not dare to ask any more questions, but the\r\nwish to do so overcame his shyness. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy ...\xe2\x80\x9d he began, and then he\r\nwas silent again.\r\n\r\nHis mother helped him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it you want to say, my child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t they stay with us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t stay with us,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother answered, \xe2\x80\x9conly now and then\r\n...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t they speak to us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis mother said, \xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t speak to us any more ... only, now and\r\nthen ... We have to wait till they come, and then we have to wait till\r\nthey talk to us ... if they want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi became cross and asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWill my father speak to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course he will, my child,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother promised him, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ngrown up he\xe2\x80\x99ll speak to you and sometimes he\xe2\x80\x99ll let you be with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn silence, Bambi went closer to his mother, his mind filled with\r\nthoughts about the appearance of his father. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s so beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nthought, and then again, \xe2\x80\x9cso beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis mother seemed able to read his mind, and she said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nstill alive, my child, if you\xe2\x80\x99re clever and avoid danger, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be as\r\nstrong and as beautiful as your father, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll carry a crown on\r\nyour head, just like his.\r\n\r\nBambi took a deep breath. His heart became big with happiness and\r\nanticipation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5\r\n\r\nTime went by and Bambi went through many new experiences. It sometimes\r\neven made him dizzy having so many things to learn.\r\n\r\nNow he knows how to listen. Not just hear what is happening nearby, so\r\nclose that it forces itself into your ears. No, there is certainly no\r\nart in that. Now he can listen properly and with understanding to\r\nanything that happens however gently it moves, he can listen to every\r\nfine rustling that the wind brings in. He knows, for instance, when\r\nthere is a pheasant running through the undergrowth; he recognizes\r\nquite exactly that gentle scurrying that continually stops and then\r\nstarts again. He can even recognize the mice in the woods from the\r\nsound they make as they run to and fro, from the little journeys they\r\nmake. Then there are the moles who rush round in circles making a\r\nrustling noise under the elder bushes when they\xe2\x80\x99re in a good mood. He\r\nknows the brash, clear call of the falcons and listens to it as it\r\nchanges to an angry tone when a hawk or an eagle comes close; that\r\nmakes them cross because they fear their territory might be taken from\r\nthem. He knows the sound of the woodland pigeons as they flap their\r\nwings, the lovely, distant swish of the ducks as they flap their\r\nwings, and many other sounds.\r\n\r\nHe is slowly learning to understand things by his sense of smell. He\r\nwill soon understand them as well as his mother. He can understand\r\nwhat he is smelling as soon as he draws in a breath. Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s clover\r\nand that\xe2\x80\x99s rowan, he thinks when the wind is blowing in from the\r\nmeadow, and he can smell when his friend, the hare, is outdoors; I can\r\ntell that very well. Also, in among all the smells of leaves, soil,\r\nherbs and wild onions, he can tell when the polecat is going past, by\r\nputting his nose to the ground and testing it thoroughly he can tell\r\nthat the fox has been there, he might notice that somewhere nearby\r\nthere are his relatives, Auntie Ena with the children.\r\n\r\nHe is now completely at ease with the night and he no longer feels\r\nsuch a great longing to go and run about in the light of the day. Now,\r\nhe is happy to spend his days lying in the little, shady space in the\r\nundergrowth with his mother. He hears the heat of the air, and he\r\nsleeps. Now and then he wakes up and listens and smells, which is the\r\nproper thing to do. Everything is as it should be. There are only the\r\nlittle tits who would sometimes chatter with each other, the midges in\r\nthe grass \xe2\x80\x93 who are almost never able to stay quiet-talk among\r\nthemselves, and the wood pigeons never stop proclaiming their\r\ngentleness, and do so with enthusiasm. What does all that matter to\r\nBambi? He goes back to sleep.\r\n\r\nNow he is very fond of the night. Everything is gay, everything is\r\nmoving. You also, of course, have to be careful in the night time, but\r\nyou have less to worry about and you can go anywhere you want to. And\r\neverywhere you go you come across people you know, and they too will\r\nbe more carefree than they are at other times. In the night the forest\r\nis solemn and silent. There are voices to heard but just a few of them\r\nand in all this stillness they seem loud, and they sound different\r\nfrom the daytime voices and they have more effect. Bambi enjoyed\r\nhearing the owl. She is so dignified as she flies, perfectly silent,\r\nperfectly effortless. A butterfly is quiet just because of her size,\r\nbut the owl is so immense. And her face is so imposing, so determined,\r\nfull of so much thought, her eyes are so majestic. Bambi admires her\r\nfirm gaze with its quiet courage. He enjoys listening when she talked\r\nwith his mother one time, or with anyone else. He stands slightly to\r\none side, a little afraid of that imperious gaze he admires so much,\r\nhe does not understand much of the clever things she says, but he does\r\nknow that they are clever, and that enchants him, fills him with\r\nadmiration for the owl. The the owl begins her song. Haa-ah - - hahaha\r\n- - haa-ah! she sings. It sounds different from the song of the thrush\r\nor the golden oriole, different from the friendly motif of the cuckoo,\r\nbut Bambi loves the song of the owl because he feels a secretive\r\nearnestness in it, an indescribable cleverness and a mysterious\r\nmelancholy. Then the tawny owl is there again, a charming little\r\nlad. Dignified, faithful and more inquisitive than most, he always\r\nwants to stir up a fuss. Uy-iik! Uy-iik! he calls, in a voice that is\r\nshrill, terrifying and very piercing. It sounds as if his life were in\r\ndanger. But he is a cheerful character and it delights him when he\r\nstartles someone. Uy-iik! he shouts, so loudly that it alarms anyone\r\nin the wood within half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s distance. But then he has a gentle\r\ncooing laugh, just for himself, and you can only hear if you are right\r\nnext to him. Bambi had realized that the tawny owl is pleased when he\r\nstartles somebody or if somebody thinks something awful has happened\r\nto him, and ever since, whenever the tawny owl is nearby, he rushes to\r\nhim and asks, \xe2\x80\x9cHas something happened to you?,\xe2\x80\x9d or he might sigh and\r\nsay, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you really startled me!\xe2\x80\x9d Then the owl feels very\r\nsatisfied. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he says with a laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s quite a distressing\r\nsound, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it.\xe2\x80\x9d He puffs up his feathers so that he looks like a\r\nsoft, grey ball, and looks very charming.\r\n\r\nA couple of times there was even thunder and lightning, both day and\r\nnight. The first time it was by day and Bambi felt how he became\r\nafraid when, in his leafy bedroom in the woods, it became darker and\r\ndarker. It seemed to him that the night had fallen down from the sky\r\nin the middle of the day. Then, as the storm roared its way through\r\nthe woods so that the mute trees began to groan loudly, Bambi shook\r\nwith fear. And as the lightning lit up the sky and the thunder roared,\r\nBambi went mad with the horror of it and thought the world was about\r\nto be torn to pieces. He ran behind his mother, who was slightly\r\nunsettled, had jumped to her feet and was walking to and fro in the\r\nthicket. He was unable to think, unable to understand. Then the rain\r\nburst down in an angry gush. Everyone had hidden himself away, the\r\nwoods seemed empty, and there was nowhere to flee. Even in the\r\nthickest undergrowth you were whipped by the water as it rushed\r\nthrough. But the lightning stopped flashing, its fiery beams no longer\r\nflamed their way through the tops of the trees; the thunder moved away\r\nand there was only a distant rumbling to be heard before it was\r\nentirely silent. Now the rain became gentler. Its broad patter could\r\nbe heard everywhere but powerfully for another hour, the forest stood\r\nbreathing deeply in the still air and allowed itself to be soaked,\r\nno-one, now, was afraid to stand in the open. That feeling was gone,\r\nwashed away by the rain.\r\n\r\nBambi and his mother had never gone out onto the meadow as early as\r\nthey did that evening. In fact it was hardly even evening. The sun was\r\nstill high in the sky, there was a powerful freshness in the air, it\r\nhad a richer fragrance than at other times and the woods sang with a\r\nthousand voices, for everyone had come out of his hiding place and was\r\nhurrying round to each other in their excitement to tell them about\r\nwhat they had just experienced.\r\n\r\nBefore stepping onto the meadow they had to pass by a big oak tree\r\nstanding right at the edge of the woods, just beside their path. They\r\nhad to pass by this big, beautiful tree every time they went out onto\r\nthe meadow. This time there was the squirrel sitting on one of its\r\nbranches, and he wished them good evening. Bambi and the squirrel were\r\ngood friends with each other. The first time he met him Bambi thought\r\nthe squirrel was a very small deer because of his red coat, and stared\r\nat him in amazement. But Bambi really was too young at that time and\r\nsimply could not understand anything. Right from the start, he felt an\r\nexceptional liking for the squirrel. He was so well mannered in every\r\nway, the way he spoke was so pleasant, and Bambi adored the wonderful\r\nway he performed acrobatics, how he climbed, how he jumped and how he\r\nkept his balance. He would take part in the conversation while running\r\nup and down the smooth trunk of the tree as if that were nothing at\r\nall. He sat upright on a branch of the tree as it moved to and fro, he\r\nleant comfortably against his bushy tail which rose up high and\r\nhandsome behind him, he showed his white breast, moved his front paws\r\nwith great elegance, turned his head to left and right, laughed with\r\nmerry eyes and in a very short time he would say so many entertaining\r\nor interesting things. Then he came down from the tree again, and did\r\nso fast and in such jumps that anyone would think he was about to fall\r\ndown onto your head. He swung his long red tail vigorously and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Hello! So nice of you to drop by!\xe2\x80\x9d while he was still far\r\nabove Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\r\nBambi and his mother stood where they were.\r\n\r\nThe squirrel ran down the smooth trunk. \xe2\x80\x9cNow then,\xe2\x80\x9d he began to chat.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you understand that alright? I can see, of course, that\r\neverything\xe2\x80\x99s nice and tidy. And that\xe2\x80\x99s always the main thing after\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d As quick as a flash he ran back up the trunk, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntoo damp for me down there. Just a moment and I\xe2\x80\x99ll find a better\r\nplace. I hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind. Thank you. I thought you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\r\nAnd we can talk just as well from where we are now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ran to and fro on a level branch. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a business that was!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued. \xe2\x80\x9cSo much noise, such a scandal that was! Just think how\r\nshocked I am. You squeeze yourself into a nook, keep perfectly quiet,\r\nhardly daring to move. That\xe2\x80\x99s the worst thing of all, sitting there\r\nlike that without moving. You hope, of course, that nothing\xe2\x80\x99s going to\r\nhappen, don\xe2\x80\x99t you, and my tree certainly is especially suited for that\r\nsort of trick, no, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be denied, my tree is especially suited\r\n... it has to be said. I am content. However far I roam I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish\r\nfor any other. But when things happen like they did today it does get\r\nyou so upset, it\xe2\x80\x99s disgusting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe squirrel sat there, his beautiful erect tail close behind him, he\r\nshowed the white of his breast and held his two front paws emotionally\r\npressed against his heart. It was obvious that when he said he had\r\nbeen made cross he was telling the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe want to go out onto the meadow, now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother, \xe2\x80\x9cso\r\nthat we can dry ourselves off in the sunshine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a good idea,\xe2\x80\x9d the squirrel exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou really are so\r\nclever, really, I always say that you are so clever!\xe2\x80\x9d With a single\r\nleap he was on a branch higher up. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing better that you\r\ncould do now than to go out onto the meadow,\xe2\x80\x9d he called down. Then he\r\nrushed around in nimble leaps hither and thither and up into the\r\ncanopy of the trees. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to get up to where I can get some\r\nsunshine,\xe2\x80\x9d he chatted contentedly, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re all soaking wet! I want to\r\nget right up high!\xe2\x80\x9d He was not at all concerned about whether anyone\r\nwas still listening to him.\r\n\r\nOn the meadow, it was already very lively. Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s friend the hare was\r\nsitting there with his family all around him. Auntie Ena was standing\r\nthere with her children and some other people she knew. Today, Bambi\r\nsaw his father again. The came slowly out from the trees, some here,\r\nsome there, then someone else appeared. They walked slowly up and down\r\nalong the edge of the woods, each one in his own place. They paid no\r\nattention to anyone, they did not even talk to each other. Bambi\r\nfrequently looked over at them, respectfully but full of curiosity.\r\n\r\nThen he talked with Faline, Gobo and a few other children. He thought\r\nit would be alright to play for a little while. All of them said they\r\nagreed, and then the running round in circles began. Faline showed\r\nthat she was the merriest of them all. She was so lively and nimble\r\nand she sparkled with sudden new ideas. Gobo, though, quickly became\r\ntired. He had been terribly afraid while the storm was raging, it had\r\nmade his heart beat fast and it was still doing so. Maybe Gobo was a\r\nlittle bit of a weakling, but Bambi loved him because he was so\r\ngood-natured and so helpful and never let anyone see it when he was a\r\nlittle bit sad.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6\r\n\r\nTime passes, and Bambi learns how good grass tastes, how tender the\r\nbuds of leaves are, and how sweet clover is. When he presses himself\r\nagainst his mother to get some refreshment she often pushes him\r\naway. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not a little child any more,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. Sometimes she\r\nwill be even more direct and say, \xe2\x80\x9cGo away, leave me in peace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSometimes his mother would even stand up in the middle of the day in\r\ntheir little place in the wood and just walk away without looking to\r\nsee whether Bambi is following her or not. There are even times when\r\nshe is walking along the familiar paths when she seems not to notice\r\nwhether Bambi is trotting behind her like a good boy. One day his\r\nmother was not there, and Bambi does not know how that is possible,\r\ncannot understand it. But his mother is gone and Bambi, for the first\r\ntime, is alone.\r\n\r\nHe is bewildered, he becomes uneasy, he becomes nervous and anxious,\r\nand he begins to long for her quite pitifully. Very sadly he stands\r\nthere and calls to her. No-one answers, no-one comes.\r\n\r\nHe listens, he smells the air. Nothing. He calls again. Gently, inside\r\nhimself, imploringly, he calls, \xe2\x80\x9cMother ... Mother ...\xe2\x80\x9d All in vain.\r\n\r\nNow he is gripped with doubt as to whether he can endure it, so he\r\nbegins to walk.\r\n\r\nHe wanders along all the paths he knows, stops and calls out, walks on\r\nwith hesitant steps, fearful and unable to understand. He is very sad.\r\n\r\nHe carries on walking and finds himself on paths where he has never\r\nbeen before, he finds himself in parts of the wood which are strange\r\nto him. He is lost.\r\n\r\nThen he hears the voices of two children who are calling out like him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother ... mother ...!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSurely that is Gobo and Faline. It must be them.\r\n\r\nHe runs quickly towards the voices and soon sees their red coats\r\nshining through between the leaves. Gobo and Faline. There they stand\r\nnext to each other under a dogwood, looking forlorn and calling,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother ... mother ...!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re glad that they can hear something rusting in the undergrowth,\r\nbut they are disappointed when they see it is only Bambi. But they are\r\na little bit glad to see him. And Bambi is glad that he is not quite\r\nso alone any more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother\xe2\x80\x99s gone away somewhere,\xe2\x80\x9d says Bambi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOurs is gone too,\xe2\x80\x9d lamented Gobo.\r\n\r\nThey look at each other in their dismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where could they be?\xe2\x80\x9d asks Bambi, almost in tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d sighs Gobo. His heart is beating fast and he is\r\nfeeling quite miserable.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Faline says, \xe2\x80\x9cI think ... they\xe2\x80\x99re with our fathers ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGobo and Bambi look at each other in astonishment. They are\r\nimmediately gripped by a sense of awe. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean ... with our\r\nfathers?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bambi and shudders.\r\n\r\nFaline shudders too, but she makes a face that seems to be saying a\r\nlot. She looks like someone who knows more than he is willing to\r\nsay. She does not really know anything at all of course; she does not\r\neven know where she got the idea from. But as Gobo repeats, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nreally mean that?,\xe2\x80\x9d she makes herself look clever and says each time,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat is, of course, a guess, but it is at least worth thinking\r\nabout. It does not make Bambi any less uneasy though. He is not now\r\ncapable of thinking, he is too anxious and too sad.\r\n\r\nHe moves away. He does not like to spend too much time on one\r\nspot. Faline and Gobo go with him a little way; all three of them call\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother ... mother ...\xe2\x80\x9d But now Gobo and Faline have stopped; they do\r\nnot dare to go any further. Faline says, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we going? Our\r\nmother knows where we should be. So let\xe2\x80\x99s stay there so that she can\r\nfind us when she comes back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi walks on by himself. He wanders through a thicket where there is\r\na little bare patch. In the middle of the bare patch Bambi stops. It\r\nis as if he is held there by his roots and cannot leave the spot.\r\n\r\nThere, at the edge of the bare patch, in a tall hazel bush, he could\r\nmake out a form. Bambi has never seen a form like this. At the same\r\ntime a scent came to him in the air, a scent he has never smelt\r\nbefore. It is a strange aroma, heavy and sharp and exciting, enough to\r\nmake you mad.\r\n\r\nBambi stares at the form. It is remarkably erect, exceptionally\r\nnarrow, and it has a pale face which is quite naked on the nose and\r\naround the eyes. Horribly naked. This is a face that projects a\r\ndreadful horror. Cold and gruesome. This face has a monstrous power to\r\nit, a power that could leave you crippled. This face is painful to\r\nbehold, hardly bearable to behold, but Bambi nonetheless stands there\r\nand stares at it, captivated.\r\n\r\nThe form remains there motionless for a long time. Then it reaches one\r\nleg out, a leg that is positioned high up, and puts it near its\r\nface. Bambi has not noticed that it was there at all. This terrible\r\nleg stretches right out into the air, and it is merely this gesture\r\nthat sweeps Bambi away like a candle in the wind. In an instant he is\r\nback in the thicket he has just left. And he runs.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his mother is back with him. She leaps through bush and\r\nundergrowth next to him. The two of them run as fast as they can. His\r\nmother leads the way, she knows the path, and Bambi follows. In this\r\nway they keep running until they are at the entrance to their chamber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ... did you see that?\xe2\x80\x9d asks his mother gently. Bambi cannot\r\nanswer, he has no breath left. He merely nods.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was ... that was Him!\xe2\x80\x9d she says.\r\n\r\nThe two of them shuddered in horror.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7\r\n\r\nBambi was often left alone now. But he did not have the same fear of\r\nit as he had the first time. His mother would disappear, and then,\r\nhowever much he called for her, she did not come. But then she would\r\nreappear unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nOne evening, feeling very lonely, he wandered once more along the\r\npaths. He had not found Gobo and Faline even once. The sky had already\r\nturned to a light grey and it was beginning to get dark, so that the\r\ntops of the trees could be seen over the bushes and\r\nundergrowth. Something rustled in the bushes, something hurtled its\r\nway between the leaves, and then his mother appeared Close behind her\r\nanother deer made its way in. Bambi did not know who it was. Auntie\r\nEna or his father or someone else. But Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother saw immediately\r\nwho it was, despite the speed at which she had rushed past him. He\r\nheard the shrillness of her voice. She screamed, and it seemed to\r\nBambi that she did so only in fun, but then it occurred to him that\r\nthere was a slight ring of fear in that scream.\r\n\r\nAnother time, it happened in full daylight. Bambi had been walking for\r\nhours through the dense woods and finally began to call. Not so much\r\nbecause he was afraid, but because did not want to remain so alone any\r\nmore, and he felt he would soon be in a terrible state. So he began to\r\ncall for his mother.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was one of their fathers standing in front of him,\r\nlooking at him severely. Bambi had not heard him coming and he was\r\nstartled. This elder stag looked more powerful than the others, he was\r\ntaller and more proud. His coat was aflame with a deep dark red, but\r\nhis face shone silver-grey; and a powerful, black pearled crown\r\nextended high above his playful ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you calling for?\xe2\x80\x9d the old stag asked severely. Bambi\r\ntrembled in awe of the elder stag and did not dare to make any\r\nanswer. \xe2\x80\x9cYour mother hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got the time to spend on you now!\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nelder continued. Bambi was completely cowed by this imperious voice,\r\nbut at the same time he felt admiration for it. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you be by\r\nyourself for a while? You should be ashamed of yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi would\r\nhave liked to say that he could be by himself perfectly well, that he\r\nhad often been by himself, but he said nothing. He did as he was told\r\nand became terribly ashamed. The elder turned round and left\r\nhim. Bambi did not know how the stag left, where he had gone, did not\r\neven know whether he had left quickly or slowly. He was simply gone,\r\njust as suddenly as he had arrived. Bambi strained his ears, but he\r\nheard no steps moving away from him, no leaf being disturbed. That\r\nmade him suppose the elder must still be quite near to him, and he\r\nsmelt the air on every side. He learned nothing from that. Bambi\r\nsighed in relief as he was once more alone, but at the same time he\r\nyearned to see the old stag again and to make sure he was not\r\ndispleased with him.\r\n\r\nThen his mother arrived but Bambi said nothing about his meeting with\r\nthe elder. Nor did he ever call for her, now, when she was out of\r\nsight. He thought about the old stag when he wandered about on his\r\nown; he felt a powerful wish to come across him. Then he would say to\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cSee? I\xe2\x80\x99m not calling for anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d And the elder would praise\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe did speak to Gobo and Faline though, the next time they were\r\ntogether on the meadow. They listened with excitement and they had had\r\nno experience of their own that could compare with this. \xe2\x80\x9cWeren\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nscared?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gobo excitedly. Yes! Bambi admitted, he had been\r\nscared. Just a little bit. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d have been terribly scared,\xe2\x80\x9d Gobo told\r\nhim. Bambi answered that no, he had not been very scared, because the\r\nelder had been so majestic. Gobo told him, \xe2\x80\x9cThat wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been\r\nmuch help for me. I\xe2\x80\x99d have been too scared even to look at him. When I\r\nget scared everything flickers in front of my eyes so that I can\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nanything and my heart beats so hard that I can\xe2\x80\x99t breathe.\xe2\x80\x9d What Bambi\r\nhad told them made Faline very thoughtful and she said nothing.\r\n\r\nThe next time they met, though, Gobo and Faline rushed to him in great\r\nleaps and bounds. They were alone once more, as was Bambi. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nlooking for you for ages,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Gobo. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Faline with an\r\nair of importance, \xe2\x80\x9cas now we know exactly who it was that you saw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBambi was so keen to know he jumped in the air. \xe2\x80\x9cWho ...!?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFaline took pleasure in saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the old prince.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know that?\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi wanted to know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur mother told us!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Faline.\r\n\r\nBambi was astonished, and he showed it. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you tell her about it\r\nthen?\xe2\x80\x9d The two of them nodded their heads. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that was a secret!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nobjected Bambi.\r\n\r\nGobo quickly tried to excuse himself. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t me. It was Faline who\r\ndid it.\xe2\x80\x9d But Faline cheerfully called, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, so what? Secret!? I wanted\r\nto know who it was, and now we do know, and that\xe2\x80\x99s much more\r\ninteresting!\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi was burning to hear all about this, and his wish\r\nwas satisfied. Faline told him everything. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s the most noble stag\r\nin the whole wood. He\xe2\x80\x99s the prince. There is no second most noble,\r\nno-one comes near to him. No-one knows how old he is. No-one knows\r\nwhere he lives. No-one knows who his relatives are. Very few have ever\r\neven seen him. Now and then there\xe2\x80\x99s a rumour that he\xe2\x80\x99s dead because he\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t been seen for a long time. Then somebody catches a glimpse of\r\nhim and then everyone knows he\xe2\x80\x99s still alive. No-one has ever dared to\r\nask him where he\xe2\x80\x99s been. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t speak to anyone and no-one dares\r\nto speak to him. He goes along the paths where no-one else ever goes;\r\nhe knows every part of the wood, even the most distant corner. And\r\nnothing is a danger to him. Other princes might tussle with each\r\nother, sometimes as a test or in fun but sometimes they fight in\r\nearnest. It\xe2\x80\x99s many years since he fought with anyone. And there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno-one still alive who did fight with him a long time ago. He\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ngreat prince.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi forgave Gobo and Faline for having carelessly chatted about his\r\nsecret with their mother. He was even quite satisfied about it as now,\r\nafter all, it was him who had experienced all the all these important\r\nthings. Nonetheless, he was glad that Gobo and Faline did not know\r\neverything quite precisely, that the great prince had said, \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nbe by yourself for a while?,\xe2\x80\x9d that they did not know he had said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nshould be ashamed of yourself!.\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi was glad, now, that he had kept\r\nsilent about these admonitions. Faline would have told everything\r\nabout that just like everything else, and then the whole forest would\r\nhave been gossiping about it.\r\n\r\nThat night, as the moon was rising, Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother came back\r\nagain. She was suddenly there standing under the great oak at the edge\r\nof the meadow and looking round for Bambi. He saw her straight away\r\nand ran over to her. That night Bambi had another new experience. His\r\nmother was tired and hungry. She did not walk about as much as she\r\nusually did but satisfied herself there on the meadow where Bambi also\r\nusually took his meals. Together there, they munched on the bushes and\r\nas they did so, in that remarkably pleasant way, they wandered deeper\r\nand deeper into the woods. There was a loud noise that came through\r\nthe greenery. Before Bambi had any idea of what was happening his\r\nmother began to scream loudly, just as she did when she was greatly\r\nstartled or confused. \xe2\x80\x9cA-oh!\xe2\x80\x9d she screamed, jumped away, then stopped\r\nand screamed, \xe2\x80\x9cA-oh, ba-oh!.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, Bambi saw some immense figures\r\nappear, coming towards them through the noise. They came quite\r\nclose. They looked like Bambi and his mother, like Auntie Ena and\r\nanyone else of their species, but they were enormous, they had grown\r\nso big and powerful that you felt compelled to look up at them. Like\r\nhis mother, Bambi began to scream, \xe2\x80\x9cA-oh ... Ba-oh ...Ba-oh!.\xe2\x80\x9d He was\r\nhardly aware that he was screaming, he could not stop himself. The\r\nline of figures went slowly past, three or four enormous figures one\r\nafter another. Last of all came one that was even bigger than the\r\nothers, it had a wild mane around its neck and its head was crowned\r\nwith a whole tree. Just to see it took your breath away. Bambi stood\r\nthere and howled as loudly as he could, as he felt more frightened and\r\nbewildered than he ever had been before. His fear was of a particular\r\nkind. He felt as if he were pitifully small, and even his mother\r\nseemed to be the same. He felt ashamed, although he had no idea why,\r\nat the same time the horror of it shook him and he once more began to\r\nhowl. \xe2\x80\x9cBa-oh ... Ba-a-oh!.\xe2\x80\x9d It made him feel better when he shouted\r\nlike that.\r\n\r\nThe line of figures had passed. There was nothing more to see and\r\nnothing more to hear from in. Even Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother became silent. There\r\nwas only Bambi who would whine briefly from time to time. He was still\r\nafraid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can be quiet now,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother said, \xe2\x80\x9clook, they\xe2\x80\x99ve gone away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Bambi, \xe2\x80\x9cwho was that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, they\xe2\x80\x99re not really that dangerous,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were\r\nour big relatives ... yes ... they are big and they\xe2\x80\x99re quality ...\r\nmuch higher quality than you or me ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd aren\xe2\x80\x99t they dangerous?\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot normally,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother explained. \xe2\x80\x9cBut they say there are many\r\nthings that have happened. People say this and that about them but I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know if there\xe2\x80\x99s any truth in these stories. They\xe2\x80\x99ve never done\r\nanything to me or to anyone I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy would they do anything to us when they\xe2\x80\x99re relatives of ours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthought Bambi. He wanted to be quiet, but he was still shaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose they\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything to us,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother answered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure, and I get alarmed every time I see them. I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstop myself. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same every time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi was slowly soothed down by this conversation, but he remained\r\nthoughtful. Right above him, in among the branches of an alder tree,\r\nan impressive tawny owl shrieked. But Bambi was confused and forgot,\r\nfor once, to show that he was startled. The owl, however still came\r\ndown to him and asked, \xe2\x80\x9cGive you a shock, did I?.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Bambi. \xe2\x80\x9cYou always give me a shock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe owl gave a quiet laugh; he was satisfied. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t blame\r\nme for it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just the way I do things.\xe2\x80\x9d He fluffed up\r\nhis plumage till he looked like a ball, sank his beak into his soft,\r\ndowny feathers, and put on a terribly nice, serious expression. That\r\nwas enough for him.\r\n\r\nBambi opened his heart to him. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he began in a way that\r\nseemed older than his age, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve just had a shock that was far bigger\r\nthan the one you gave me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the owl, no longer so satisfied with himself.\r\n\r\nBambi told him about his meeting with his enormous relatives.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell me about your relatives,\xe2\x80\x9d declared the owl. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nrelatives too, you know. But all I have to do is look round me\r\nanywhere in the daytime and they\xe2\x80\x99re all over me. Na, there\xe2\x80\x99s not much\r\npoint in having relatives. If they\xe2\x80\x99re bigger than you they\xe2\x80\x99re good for\r\nnothing, and if they\xe2\x80\x99re smaller they\xe2\x80\x99re even more good for nothing. If\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re bigger than you then you can\xe2\x80\x99t stand them \xe2\x80\x98cause they\xe2\x80\x99re so\r\nhaughty, and if they\xe2\x80\x99re smaller they can\xe2\x80\x99t stand you \xe2\x80\x98cause they think\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re haughty. Na, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know anything about anything of\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut ... I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know my relatives ...\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi shyly and\r\nwishing he did. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d never heard anything about them and today was the\r\nfirst time I saw them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you bother about those people,\xe2\x80\x9d the owl advised him. \xe2\x80\x9cJust take\r\nmy word for it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, rolling his eyes in a meaningful way, \xe2\x80\x9ctake\r\nmy word, that\xe2\x80\x99s the best thing to do. Relatives are never as good as\r\nfriends. Look at the two of us, we\xe2\x80\x99re not related but we\xe2\x80\x99re good\r\nfriends, aren\xe2\x80\x99t we, and very nice it is too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi was about to say something more, but the owl continued speaking.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got some experience in things like that. You\xe2\x80\x99re a bit young,\r\nstill. Take my word, I know better about these things. And anyway, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see why I should get involved in your family matters.\xe2\x80\x9d He rolled\r\nhis eyes, and rolled them in a way that seemed so thoughtful, and sat\r\nwith an expression that seemed so earnest and meaningful, that Bambi\r\nwas modest and said nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8\r\n\r\nAnother night went by, and the following day something else happened.\r\n\r\nThe sky was cloudless, and the morning was full of dew and\r\nfreshness. All the leaves on the trees and the bushes suddenly had a\r\nmore vivid scent. The meadow breathed the air in broad waves and\r\nlifted it up to the tree tops.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Peep\xe2\x80\x99 said the tits as they woke up. They said it quite quietly, but\r\nas it was still twilight and the sky was grey they said nothing more\r\nfor a little while. For a time there was silence. Then the raucous,\r\nrasping sound of a crow came from high up in the air. The crows had\r\nwoken up and were visiting each other in the tree tops. The magpie\r\nanswered straight back: \xe2\x80\x9cShakerakshak ... can you believe this, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nstill asleep?\xe2\x80\x9d Then hundreds of calls, here and there, far and near,\r\ntentatively began: peep! Peep! Tiu! These sounds still had something\r\nof sleep, something of the twilight about them. And yet they were\r\nactually all quite distinct from each other.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a blackbird flew up to the top of a fir tree. He flew right\r\nup to the very highest, thinnest point, reaching into the air. He sat\r\nhigh up there and looked out over all the other trees, near and far\r\nwhile the pale grey sky, still tired from the night, began to glow in\r\nthe east and come to life. Then the bird began to sing. She was only a\r\ntiny dark spot if you glimpsed her from the ground. In the distance\r\nher little black body looked like a wilted leaf. But her song spread\r\nout all over the forest in great celebration. And then everything came\r\nto life. The finches struck up and the robins and the goldfinches made\r\ntheir voices heard. Pigeons rushed from one place to another with wide\r\nflapping and swishing of their wings. The pheasants shouted out loud\r\nas if their throats would burst. The sound of their wings was gentle\r\nbut powerful as they swooped down to earth from the trees where they\r\nhad been sleeping. On the ground they repeated their metallic,\r\nbursting cry many more times, and then they would coo gently. High in\r\nthe sky, the falcons called out their sharp and joyful \xe2\x80\x98yayaya!\xe2\x80\x99 .\r\n\r\nThe sun had risen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Diu-diyu!\xe2\x80\x99 rejoiced the oriole. As he flew back and forth between the\r\ntwigs and branches his round, yellow body shone in the beams of the\r\nmorning sun like an exhilarated ball of gold.\r\n\r\nBambi stepped under the big oak tree on the meadow. It sparkled in the\r\nmorning dew, had a scent of grass, flowers and wet earth, it whispered\r\nof the thousand lives it had led. There sat Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s friend, the hare,\r\nand he seemed to be thinking about something very important. There was\r\na haughty pheasant there, walking slowly. He pecked at the stalks of\r\ngrass and looked carefully all around himself. His dark blue neck\r\nsparkled in the sunlight like a jewel necklace. But close in front of\r\nBambi there stood one of the princes, very near to him. Bambi had\r\nnever seen him before, had never even seen any of the fathers this\r\nclose up. He stood there before him, very close to a hazel bush and\r\nstill slightly concealed behind its twigs. Bambi did not move. He\r\nhoped the prince would come out fully from behind the bush, and he\r\nwondered whether he could dare to speak to him. He wanted to ask his\r\nmother and glanced around for her, but his mother had already gone\r\nahead and stood a long way away with Auntie Ena. Just then, Gobo and\r\nFaline came out of the woods and ran onto the meadow. Bambi did not\r\nmove but wondered about what he should do. If he wanted to get over to\r\nhis mother and the others he would have to pass by the prince. He\r\nthought that would be unseemly. So what? he thought, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to\r\nget my mother\xe2\x80\x99s permission first. It was the old prince who spoke to\r\nme first and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell my mother anything about it. I will speak\r\nto the prince, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if I can. I\xe2\x80\x99ll say to him: Good morning your\r\nhighness. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing about that that might make him cross. And if\r\nhe is I can just run away. Bambi wondered whether he had made the\r\nright decision, and it kept on making him feel unsteady on his feet.\r\n\r\nNow the prince stepped away from the hazel bush and onto the meadow.\r\n\r\nNow ... thought Bambi.\r\n\r\nJust then there was a loud clap of thunder.\r\n\r\nBambi recoiled and did not know what had happened.\r\n\r\nHe saw how the prince jumped high into the air in front of him and saw\r\nhim rush past him into the woods.\r\n\r\nBambi looked hard all around himself, he felt as if he could still\r\nhear the thunder clap. He saw his mother, Auntie Ena, Gobo and Faline,\r\nsome way away, had fled into the woods, he saw his friend the hare\r\nrush away in a panic, saw the pheasant run away with his neck\r\nstretched out ahead of him, and he could not understand what it all\r\ncould be about. The prince lay there, a broad wound had torn his\r\nshoulder open, he was bloody and dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t just stand there!\xe2\x80\x9d came a shrill cry from beside him. It was\r\nhis mother who was running at a full gallop. \xe2\x80\x9cRun!\xe2\x80\x9d she called, \xe2\x80\x9cRun\r\nas fas as you can!.\xe2\x80\x9d She did not stop, but rushed on, and her command\r\npulled Bambi along with her. He ran with all his strength.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis mother, gasping for breath, answered, \xe2\x80\x9cThat ... was ... Him!.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi shuddered, and they ran on.\r\n\r\nFinally, out of breath, they stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say? Please, what do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d called a thin voice from\r\nabove them. Bambi looked up and saw the squirrel hurrying down to them\r\nthrough the branches of the tree. \xe2\x80\x9cI jumped all the way here beside\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x9d he called. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s terrible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you there when it happened?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell of course I was there\xe2\x80\x9d the squirrel replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m still shaking\r\nfrom it, all my limbs are shaking.\xe2\x80\x9d He sat upright, his magnificent\r\nflag against his back, showing his slender, white breast and pressing\r\nboth his front paws against his body to reassure himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m quite\r\nbeside myself with fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid too, and it\xe2\x80\x99s made me quite numb\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t understand it. None of us saw anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d The squirrel became excited. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re wrong there, you\r\nknow. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d been watching him for a long time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo had I!\xe2\x80\x9d called another voice. It was the magpie; she flew up to\r\nthem and sat down on a branch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd me!\xe2\x80\x9d called another screeching voice from even higher in the ash\r\ntree. There was the jay sitting there.\r\n\r\nAnd from the very tops of the trees there was a pair of crows who\r\ncawed angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cWe saw him too!\xe2\x80\x9d they interjected.\r\n\r\nThey all sat round in earnest discussion. They were exceptionally\r\nagitated and, it seemed, full of anger and fear.\r\n\r\nWho, thought Bambi, who have they seen?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did everything I possibly could do,\xe2\x80\x9d the squirrel assured them as\r\nhe pressed both his forepaws to his heart. \xe2\x80\x9cReally everything, to\r\nbring Him to the attention of the poor prince.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo did I,\xe2\x80\x9d the jay screeched, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many times I shouted\r\nto him! But he just didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear me either,\xe2\x80\x9d the magpie said with a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cTen times\r\nit was I called to \xe2\x80\x98im. Just as I was going to fly over to him, I\r\nthought to meself; well if \xe2\x80\x98e can\xe2\x80\x99t hear me I\xe2\x80\x99ll fly over onto that\r\nhazel bush, just where he\xe2\x80\x99s standing; he\xe2\x80\x99s got to hear me from there.\r\nBut that was just when it happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my voice is louder than yours, and I did all I could to warn\r\n\xe2\x80\x98im,\xe2\x80\x9d said the crow in a bitter tone. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you posh lot never give\r\nenough attention to birds like us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, never enough at all,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed the squirrel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe do what we can,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the magpie, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s not our fault if\r\nsomebody\xe2\x80\x99s unlucky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was such a handsome prince,\xe2\x80\x9d the squirrel lamented, \xe2\x80\x9cand in the\r\nprime of life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAch!\xe2\x80\x9d the jay screeched, \xe2\x80\x9cif he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been so stand-offish and paid\r\na bit of attention to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was certainly not stand-offish!\xe2\x80\x9d the squirrel contradicted him.\r\n\r\nThe magpie added, \xe2\x80\x9cNa, no more than the other princes like him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStupid then!\xe2\x80\x9d the jay laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re pretty stupid yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d a crow called down from above them.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t talk about being stupid. The whole forest knows how stupid\r\nyou are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the jay in astonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cNo-one can accuse me of being\r\nstupid. A bit forgetful sometimes, but I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not stupid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuit yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said the crow, now serious. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t forget what I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\njust said, but bear in mind that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t being haughty or stupid\r\nthat cost the prince his life, it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98cause you can\xe2\x80\x99t get away from\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAch!\xe2\x80\x9d screeched the jay. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like talking like this!\xe2\x80\x9d He flew\r\naway. The crow continued speaking. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s even a lot in my family\r\nwho he\xe2\x80\x99s tricked. He kills anyone \xe2\x80\x98e feels like killing. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing we can do about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve just got to keep a watch out for him,\xe2\x80\x9d the magpie added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, you certainly do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the crow sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cCheerio.\xe2\x80\x9d She flew\r\naway and her family went with her.\r\n\r\nBambi looked around. His mother was no longer there.\r\n\r\nWhat are they talking about? he thought. I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand everything\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re saying. Who is this \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99 they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about? It must be\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99 that I saw in the woods that time ... but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t kill me\r\n...\r\n\r\nBambi thought of the prince whom he had just seen lying in front of\r\nhim with a bloody, shredded shoulder. He was now dead. Bambi walked\r\non. The forest was again in song with a thousand voices, the sun drove\r\nits broad beams of light through the tree tops, everywhere was light,\r\nthe leaves began to steam, high in the air called the falcons, and\r\nhere, close by, a woodpecker was laughing out loud as if nothing had\r\nhappened. Bambi did not become cheerful. He felt under threat from\r\nsomething dark, he could not understand how the others could be so gay\r\nand carefree when life was so hard and so dangerous. At that moment he\r\nwas gripped by the desire to get a long way away from there, to go\r\ndeeper and deeper into the woods. He felt the urge to go to a place\r\nwhere the trees were at their densest, where he could find a corner to\r\nslide into, a place surrounded broad and far by the most impenetrable\r\nundergrowth, where he could not possibly be seen. He did not want to\r\ngo back out onto that meadow.\r\n\r\nSomething gently moved in the bushes beside him. Bambi was greatly\r\nstartled. There, in front of him, stood the elder.\r\n\r\nThere was something twitching in Bambi; he wanted to run away but he\r\ntook control of himself and remained. The elder looked at him with his\r\nbig, deep eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWere you there when it happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi quietly. His heart was beating so hard he could feel\r\nit in his mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is your mother?\xe2\x80\x9d the elder asked.\r\n\r\nBambi answered, still speaking quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe elder continued to look at him. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re not calling out for\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi looked into that venerable, ice-grey face, looked up at the\r\nelder\xe2\x80\x99s majestic crown, and suddenly found himself full of courage. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan be by myself, too,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe elder looked at him for a while and then, softly, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cAre\r\nyou not the little one who, not very long ago, was crying for his\r\nmother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi felt slightly ashamed, but continued to be courageous. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\r\nthat was me,\xe2\x80\x9d he admitted.\r\n\r\nThe elder looked at him in silence, and it seemed to Bambi that these\r\ndeep eyes were watching him with more tenderness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou told me off for\r\nit, elder prince,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cfor not being able to be by\r\nmyself. I can do now, though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe elder looked at Bambi, examining him, and smiled, very slightly,\r\nbarely noticeably, but Bambi did notice it. \xe2\x80\x9cElder prince,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\ntrustingly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat happened back there? I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand it ... who\r\nis this \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99 they\xe2\x80\x99re all talking about ...?\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped, shocked at\r\nthe dark look that bade him to be silent.\r\n\r\nThey said nothing for a while. The elder stopped looking at Bambi and\r\nstared into the distance, then he said, slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cListen for yourself,\r\nsmell for yourself, watch for yourself. Learn for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d He raised\r\nthe crown on his head even higher. \xe2\x80\x9cFarewell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Then nothing\r\nmore. And then, he had disappeared.\r\n\r\nBambi, dismayed, stayed where he was and wanted to give up hope. But\r\nthe prince\xe2\x80\x99s farewell was still in his ears and gave him some comfort.\r\nFarewell, the elder had said. So he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cross with him.\r\n\r\nBambi was filled with pride, felt that he had been lifted out of\r\nsomething that was formal and serious. Yes, life was hard and full of\r\ndanger. Let it bring whatever it wants, he would learn somehow to bear\r\nall of it.\r\n\r\nSlowly, he walked deeper into the woods.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9\r\n\r\nThe leaves were falling from the big oak tree at the edge of he\r\nmeadow. They were falling from all the trees. One of the branches of\r\nthe oak was much higher up than the others and it stretched a long way\r\nout over the meadow. At its tip there sat two leaves together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThings ain\xe2\x80\x99t like they they used to be,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the leaves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d the other answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThere were so many of us last night\r\nwho ... we\xe2\x80\x99re just about the only ones left here on this branch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never know who it\xe2\x80\x99s goin to \xe2\x80\x98appen to next,\xe2\x80\x9d said the first.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven when it was nice and warm and the sunshine gave you some heat\r\nyou get a storm or a cloudburst sometimes, and lots of us got torn off\r\nthen, even them that were still young. You never know who it\xe2\x80\x99s goin to\r\n\xe2\x80\x98appen to next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t get much sunshine these days,\xe2\x80\x9d the second leaf sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\neven when the sun does shine there\xe2\x80\x99s no strength to it. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\r\nget your strength from somewhere else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think it\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d pondered the first, \xe2\x80\x9cis it true that other\r\nleaves will come along and take our place once we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone, and then\r\nanother lot, and then another lot ...?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourse it\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the second, \xe2\x80\x9conly, we can\xe2\x80\x99t work out how\r\n... it\xe2\x80\x99s above what we can understand, that is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99d make you really sad, and all,\xe2\x80\x9d the first added.\r\n\r\nThey remained silent for a while. Then the first said quietly to\r\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you have to go away for, anyway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe second asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat \xe2\x80\x98appens to us after we\xe2\x80\x99ve fallen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe sink down ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is it, what\xe2\x80\x99s down there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe first answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Some say one thing, others say\r\nsomething different ... nobody knows, really.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe second asked, \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you think you feel anything, d\xe2\x80\x99you think you know\r\nanything about yourself when you\xe2\x80\x99re down there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe first answered, \xe2\x80\x9cWho can say? None of them who\xe2\x80\x99ve gone down there\r\nhas ever come back to tell us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were again silent for a while. Then the first leaf said tenderly\r\nto the other, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t get yourself all upset about it, here, you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nshivering, look.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh don\xe2\x80\x99t bother about that,\xe2\x80\x9d the second answered, \xe2\x80\x9canything makes me\r\nshiver these days. You just don\xe2\x80\x99t feel properly attached to where you\r\nare, do you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d better stop talking about things like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the first\r\nleaf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, we\xe2\x80\x99d better leave it,\xe2\x80\x9d the other replied. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly ... what we\r\ngoing to talk about now then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey became silent, but after a short time resumed the subject. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99you think\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the first of us to go down there, then...?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t be for a while yet,\xe2\x80\x9d the first reassured him. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s just\r\nthink about how beautiful it used to be, how wonderfully beautiful!\r\nWhen the sun came out and burned us so hot it seemed we\xe2\x80\x99d just swell\r\nup with all the good health it gave us. Remember? And then there was\r\nthe dew, early in the morning ... and the lime trees, wonderful nights\r\n...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe nights are horrible now,\xe2\x80\x9d whined the second. \xe2\x80\x9cThey never seem to\r\ncome to an end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t complain,\xe2\x80\x9d said the first leaf gently, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve lived longer\r\nthan so many others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I changed much?\xe2\x80\x9d the second leaf asked, shyly but emphatically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d the first assured him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, \xe2\x80\x98cause I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone all yellow\r\nand ugly? No, it\xe2\x80\x99s gone a bit different for me ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, give over,\xe2\x80\x9d the second contradicted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, honest,\xe2\x80\x9d the first repeated emphatically. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true, what I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ntelling you. You\xe2\x80\x99re as lovely as you as you were on the very first\r\nday. Might be a few yellow stripes here and there, but not so\xe2\x80\x99s you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nnotice, but they just make you look all the lovelier. Honest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d the second leaf whispered, feeling quite touched.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I believe you ... well not everything ... but thank you\r\nfor it. You are so good to me ... and you always \xe2\x80\x98ave been ... it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonly now that I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to understand how good you\xe2\x80\x99ve always been\r\nto me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, stop it now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the first, and became silent himself. He could\r\nnot talk any more because he was upset.\r\n\r\nNow they were both silent. The hours passed. A damp wind blew cold and\r\nhostile through the tree tops.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh ... now ...\xe2\x80\x9d said the second leaf, \xe2\x80\x9c... I ...\xe2\x80\x9d His voice broke\r\noff. He was gently removed from his place and fluttered down to the\r\nearth. - Winter had come.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10\r\n\r\nBambi noticed that the world had changed. It was hard for him to get\r\nby in this altered world. They had all been living like rich people\r\nand now they began to find themselves in poverty. But wealth was all\r\nthat Bambi had ever known. He took it as a matter of course to be\r\nsurrounded by the greatest excess and the finest luxury on all sides,\r\nto have no worries about finding food, to sleep in a beautiful room\r\nhung with green that no-one could see into, and to walk about in a\r\nmajestically smooth, glossy, red coat.\r\n\r\nEverything was different now, and he had not really noticed it, not\r\nproperly. The change which had taken place had been, for him, just a\r\nsequence of short-lived appearances. He found it entertaining when\r\nmilky-white veils of mist drew the morning dampness up from the\r\nmeadow, or when they would suddenly sink down from the twilight\r\nsky. They were so beautiful as they dissipated in the sunlight. He\r\nliked the frost too, which surprised him when he saw the ground and\r\nthe meadow strewn with white. He spent much time luxuriating in the\r\nsound of his grown-up relatives, the stags, as they shouted. The whole\r\nforest would rumble from the voices of these kings. Bambi would listen\r\nand be very afraid, but his heart would thump in admiration whenever\r\nhe heard this thunderous call. He thought about the crowns worn by\r\nthese kings, so big and with so many branches, like a majestic oak,\r\nand he would think their voices were just as powerful as their\r\ncrowns. Their imperious commands rolled out in the deepest tones, the\r\nmonstrous groans of noble blood as it rushed around their bodies and\r\nseethed with the ancient power of yearning, haughtiness and\r\npride. Whenever Bambi heard these voices he felt overwhelmed by them,\r\nbut he was proud to have such distinguished relatives. At the same\r\ntime he felt a peculiar, excited irritation at their being so\r\nunapproachable. That hurt him, that humiliated him, although he did\r\nnot know exactly why or how, or even how he could come any closer to\r\nknowing.\r\n\r\nIt was only when the kings\xe2\x80\x99 time for lovemaking was over, and their\r\nthunderous cries went silent, that Bambi started paying attention to\r\nother things once more. When he walked through the woods by night or\r\nlay in his room by day he heard the whisperings of the leaves as they\r\nfell through the trees. The rustling sounds, as they trickled down\r\nthrough the air from every tree top, every twig, were incessant. The\r\ngentle, silvery light of the moon ran continuously down to the\r\nearth. It was wonderful to wake up to it, and it was delicious to go\r\nto sleep with this mysterious, sad whispering. The leaves at that time\r\nlay deep and loose on the ground, and when you walked through them\r\nthey crackled loudly and they rustled quietly. It was fun to have to\r\npush them aside with each step because their layers were so deep. They\r\nmade a shhh-shhh noise that was very fine, very light and\r\nsilvery. This was also very useful, as during these times there was no\r\nneed to make great effort with listening and smelling. Everything\r\ncould be heard from a long way off. The leaves rustled from the\r\nslightest movement, they cried out Shhh! Who could possibly sneak up\r\non you? No-one.\r\n\r\nBut then came the rain. From early morning to late in the evening it\r\npoured down, it struck and splattered from late in the evening and all\r\nthrough the night until back to the morning, eased off for a little\r\nwhile and then began again with new strength. The air seemed full of\r\ncold water, the whole world seemed full of it. Your mouth was filled\r\nwith water if you only tried to gather a few blades of grass and if\r\nyou pulled at a bush then water would gush down into your eyes and up\r\nyour nose. The leaves on the ground no longer rustled. They lay there\r\nsoft and heavy, pressed down by the rain, and made no sound at\r\nall. Bambi, for the first time, learned how vexing it was to have\r\nwater streaming down on you all through the day and all through the\r\nnight and to be soaked to the skin. He was still not very cold, but he\r\nyearned for warmth and he thought it was miserable to have to move\r\nabout while soaked through and through.\r\n\r\nBut then, when the stormy weather came down from the north, Bambi\r\nlearnt what it really means to be cold. It was little help to cuddle\r\nup close to his mother. At first, of course, he liked it very much to\r\nlie there and be nice and warm, at least on one side. But the stormy\r\nwinds raged all through the night and all through the day and all\r\nthrough the forest. It seemed to be driven by an incomprehensible,\r\nice-cold fury, an insane rage that wanted to tear all the trees up by\r\nthe roots and carry them away or to destroy them in some other\r\nway. The trees roared as they put up powerful resistance, they fought\r\nbravely against this immense attack. You could hear their long drawn\r\nout groans, the sighs of their creaking, there was a loud bang when\r\none of their mighty boughs split, the angry crack when, here and\r\nthere, the trunk of a tree would break, the cry of pain from all its\r\nwounds as its body was overpowered, split and killed. But then it\r\nbecame impossible to hear anything more, as the storm fell onto the\r\nforest with even greater violence and its roars drowned out any other\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nBambi now understood that a period of need and poverty had begun. He\r\nsaw how much the rain and the storms had changed the world. There were\r\nnow no leaves on any of the trees or bushes. They stood there robbed\r\nof all they had, their whole body was naked and could be clearly seen,\r\nthey looked pitiful as they stretched their naked, brown arms up to\r\nthe sky. The grass on the meadow was limp and dark brown and so short\r\nit seemed to have been burnt to the ground. Even the place where Bambi\r\nand his mother slept seemed pitiful and bare now. Since its green\r\nwalls had disappeared it offered no privacy, and the wind blew in from\r\nevery side.\r\n\r\nOne day a young magpie flew over the meadow. Something white and cold\r\nfell into her eye, then another, then another, and laid a light veil\r\nover her sight. Little, soft, dazzling-white flakes were dancing all\r\naround her. The magpie flapped her wings and nearly stopped, but then\r\ndirected herself upward and went higher in the sky. In vain! The soft,\r\ncool flakes were there again and again they fell onto her and into her\r\neyes. Once again she directed herself upward and rose even higher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust don\xe2\x80\x99t bother, love,\xe2\x80\x9d called a crow from above her who was flying\r\nin the same direction, \xe2\x80\x9cjust give it up. You can\xe2\x80\x99t fly high enough to\r\nget out of these flakes. That\xe2\x80\x99s snow, i\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSnow?\xe2\x80\x9d said the magpie in amazement as she struggled against each new\r\nflurry that came at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yeah!\xe2\x80\x9d said the crow. \xe2\x80\x9cWinter\xe2\x80\x99s here. That\xe2\x80\x99s snow, that is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the magpie, \xe2\x80\x9cI only left the nest in May. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what winter\xe2\x80\x99s like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot like that,\xe2\x80\x9d the crow observed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll soon find\r\nout though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if that\xe2\x80\x99s what snow is,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the magpie, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to sit\r\ndown for a little while.\xe2\x80\x9d She went down and sat on a twig on an alder\r\ntree and shook herself.\r\n\r\nThe crow flew lazily on.\r\n\r\nAt first, Bambi was pleased to see the snow. The air was still and\r\nmild, the white stars floated in the sky and everything in the world\r\nlooked entirely new. It had become lighter, even gayer, thought Bambi,\r\nand for the brief periods when the sun came out everything lit up, the\r\nwhite covering sparkled and shone with such power that it was quite\r\ndazzling.\r\n\r\nBut Bambi soon stopped being pleased about the snow, as it was\r\nbecoming harder and harder to find food. You had to scrape the snow\r\naside and that took a lot of effort before a small patch of limp grass\r\nwas exposed. And the snow cut into your legs too, so that you had to\r\nbe careful not to get your feet injured. Gobo already had done. But,\r\nof course, that is what Gobo was like, he was never able to endure\r\nvery much, and he caused his mother a lot of worry.\r\n\r\nThey were together now for almost all of the time, and they also had\r\nmore company than previously. Ena would often call by with her\r\nchildren. Marena, a girl who was nearly grown up, had also begun to\r\nmix in their circle. But it was probably old Mrs. Nettla who came by\r\nfor a chat most often. She was quite alone and had an opinion about\r\neverything. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to have nothing more to do with\r\nchildren. That\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasure that I\xe2\x80\x99ve really had enough of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Faline would always say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x99s that then, when it\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd Mrs. Nettla would pretend to be cross and say, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a bad sort of\r\npleasure, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough of it. Everyone enjoyed chatting very\r\nmuch. They sat next to each other and talked. The children had never\r\nhad as much to listen to.\r\n\r\nEven one or two of the princes came and kept company with them now. At\r\nfirst it felt a little awkward, especially as the children were still\r\nsomewhat shy with them. But that passed quite quickly and then there\r\nwas a pleasant atmosphere. Bambi admired Prince Ronno, who was an\r\nimpressive gentleman, and he felt a tempestuous love for the young,\r\nbeautiful Karus. They had cast off their crowns and Bambi would often\r\nstare at the two round, slate-grey discs on their heads where glamour,\r\nsplendour and many tender points could be seen. Karus seemed very\r\nelegant and distinguished.\r\n\r\nIt was tremendously exciting when one of the princes would tell him\r\nabout what had happened to him. On Ronno\xe2\x80\x99s left foreleg there was a\r\nbig lump which was now overgrown with fur. He would often ask, \xe2\x80\x9cHave\r\nyou ever noticed how I limp on this leg?\xe2\x80\x9d Everyone was prompt to\r\nassure him that no-one had ever noticed any limp at all. That was what\r\nRonno wanted to hear. And it really was true to say that it was barely\r\nnoticeable. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he would then continue, \xe2\x80\x9cI escaped from something\r\nvery dangerous that day.\xe2\x80\x9d And so Ronno would go on to recount how he\r\nhad been taken by surprise by Him and hurled fire at him. But he was\r\nonly hit here on his leg. It hurt so much it could drive you mad. But\r\nit was only here, on his leg, that he had been hit. It hurt nearly\r\nenough to drive him crazy. No wonder. The bone had been shattered. But\r\nRonno did not panic. He got up and went, on just three legs. He kept\r\ngoing despite the pain, as he was well aware that he was being\r\nchased. He ran and ran until night fell. Then he allowed himself some\r\nrest. But the following morning he moved on again until he felt he was\r\nin safety. Then he groomed himself, hidden and alone, and waited for\r\nthe wound to close up. Eventually he came out of his place of safety\r\nand he was a hero. He had a limp, but that was barely noticeable.\r\n\r\nNow, when they were all together in one place so often and for so\r\nlong, when so many stories were told, Bambi heard more about Him than\r\nhe ever had before. They talked about how horrible he was to look\r\nat. Nobody could bear looking into this pale face. This was something\r\nthat Bambi already knew from his own experience. They even talked\r\nabout the smell of him that spread all around, and here, too, Bambi\r\nwould have been able to contribute to the discussion if he had not\r\nbeen too well brought up to join in with the conversations of grown\r\nups. They said this scent was of a rather puzzling sort, always\r\nchanging but instantly recognizable as it was always remarkably\r\nstimulating, unidentifiable, mysterious, but in itself rather\r\ndisgusting. They talked about Him only needing two legs to walk on and\r\nabout the wonderful strength of both his hands. Some of them did not\r\nexactly know what hands are. But Mrs. Nettla explained it to them. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see anything surprising about it. The squirrel can do everything\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve just mentioned and does it in just the way he wants to, and\r\nevery little mouse can do the same.\xe2\x80\x9d She turned her head\r\ndisrespectfully away from them. \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d the others exclaimed and they\r\nmade her understand that it\xe2\x80\x99s far from being the same thing. But\r\nMrs. Nettla was not to be intimidated. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what about the falcon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe declared, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat about the buzzard? And the owl? They\xe2\x80\x99ve only got\r\ntwo legs, and when they want to take hold of something, as you call\r\nit, they just stand on one leg and hold it with the other. That\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nlot harder to do, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure He can\xe2\x80\x99t do it. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Nettla was not in\r\nany way inclined to admire anything about Him. She hated him with all\r\nher heart. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s disgusting,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and nothing would change her\r\nmind. And there was nobody who contradicted her, as there was nobody\r\nwho found Him very lovable. But the matter became even more confusing\r\nas they talked about it, saying He had a third hand, not just two\r\nhands but a third hand as well. Mrs. Nettla\xe2\x80\x99s reply was curt. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njust an old wives\xe2\x80\x99 tale,\xe2\x80\x9d she concluded. \xe2\x80\x9cI just don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow Ronno joined in. \xe2\x80\x9cSo what?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cand what do you think it\r\nwas that He used to shatter my leg? Just tell me that, will you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Nettla gave a glib retort. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s your affair, my love! He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnever shattered anything of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAuntie Ena said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen lots of different things in my life, and I\r\nthink there must be something in it if he insists He\xe2\x80\x99s got a third\r\nhand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYoung Karus observed politely, \xe2\x80\x9cI can only agree with you there.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a crow who\xe2\x80\x99s a friend of mine ...\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped in embarrassment\r\nfor a short while and looked at all the people there as if he were\r\nafraid of being laughed at. But when he saw that they were listening\r\nto him and giving him all their attention, he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cThe crow is\r\nexceptionally talented, I can\xe2\x80\x99t deny that, she\xe2\x80\x99s astonishingly\r\ntalented. She told me that He really does have three hands, but not\r\nall the time. It\xe2\x80\x99s that third hand, the crow told me, that\xe2\x80\x99s the nasty\r\none. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t grow out of Him like the other two; He carries it\r\nhanging on his shoulder. The crow says she can always tell whether He\r\nor any of his kind is dangerous or not. If He comes along without that\r\nthird hand then He isn\xe2\x80\x99t dangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Nettla laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cThis crow of yours is just stupid, Karus, take\r\nit from me, my love. If she was as clever as she thinks she is she\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nknow that He\xe2\x80\x99s always dangerous \xe2\x80\x93always!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the others had something to say too. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there are some of them\r\nwho are not dangerous at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother thought. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can see it\r\nstraight away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo what?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Nettla. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you just stand there till they come\r\nup to you and say hello to them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother answered softly, \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I don\xe2\x80\x99t just stand there, I\r\nrun away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Faline burst out with, \xe2\x80\x9cYou should always run away!\xe2\x80\x9d Everyone\r\nlaughed. They continued talking about this third hand, and as they did\r\nso they became more serious and the sense of the horror of it came\r\namong them. Whatever it was, a third hand or something different, it\r\nwas something terrible, something they could not understand. Most of\r\nthem knew about it only from what they had been told by others, but\r\nsome of them had seen it with their own eyes. He would stand there, a\r\nlong way off, without moving, there was no way of explaining what He\r\ndid or how it happened, but there would suddenly be a bang like\r\nthunder, fire sprayed out, and even at that distance from Him you\r\nwould collapse with your breast torn open, and you would die. They all\r\nlowered their heads while she told them this as if they were pressed\r\ndown by some dark force that had some inexplicable power over\r\nthem. They listened eagerly to the many different accounts of seeing\r\nHim, and every story was full of horror, full of blood and\r\nsuffering. They took all this in and still wanted to hear more of what\r\nwas being said. Stories that must have been made up, all the fairy\r\ntales and legends they had heard from their grandfathers and\r\ngreat-grandfathers, and as they listened they unconsciously learned,\r\nwhile still afraid, about how to make peace with this dark world or,\r\nat least, to run away from it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does that happen, asked young Karus, quite dispirited, \xe2\x80\x9cthat He\r\ncan be so far away and still knock you down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t your clever crow explain that to you?\xe2\x80\x9d sneered Mrs. Nettla.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Karus with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cshe says she\xe2\x80\x99s often seen it, but\r\nno-one knows how to explain it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, He can even knock the crows down from the tree when He feels\r\nlike it,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Ronno.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd He knocks the pheasants down from the sky,\xe2\x80\x9d Auntie Ena added.\r\n\r\nBambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe throws His hand out there. That\xe2\x80\x99s what my\r\ngrandmother told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes He really?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Nettla asked. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is it that makes that\r\nhorrible thunderous noise then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen His hand tears itself away from His body,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother\r\nexplained, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a flash of fire and it makes a bang like thunder.\r\nOn the inside that\xe2\x80\x99s all He is, just fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ronno. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is some truth in saying He\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\nbut fire on the inside, but it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong to say it\xe2\x80\x99s His hand He uses. A\r\nstrike from a hand could never cause injuries like that. You can see\r\nit for yourselves. It\xe2\x80\x99s much more likely to be a tooth that He throws\r\nat us. Think about it, that would explain a lot. And so you die\r\nbecause He bites you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYoung Karus breathed a deep sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cWill He never stop chasing us\r\ndown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Marena spoke, the girl was now nearly an adult. \xe2\x80\x9cThat means that\r\none day He\xe2\x80\x99ll come and join us and be as gentle as we are. He\xe2\x80\x99ll play\r\ngames with us, everyone in the forest will be happy and we\xe2\x80\x99ll make\r\npeace together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Nettla shrieked with laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s best if He just stays where\r\nhe is and leaves us alone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say things like that,\xe2\x80\x9d Auntie Ena admonished her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why not then?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mrs. Nettla as she became more heated.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s really not something I could imagine. Make peace with Him!\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s been murdering us for as long as we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to think, and\r\nour sisters and our mothers and our brothers! For all the time we\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen in the world He never leaves us in peace, He kills us whenever he\r\nsees us ... and you want to make peace with him? That\xe2\x80\x99s just so\r\nstupid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarena looked at everyone with her gently sparkling eyes wide open.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing stupid about making peace,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\r\nmake peace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to get something to eat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Nettla as she turned\r\nround and ran off.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11\r\n\r\nThe winter went on. Sometimes it became milder, but then the snow\r\nwould come again, and each time it did it lay higher on the ground so\r\nthat it was impossible to scrape it away. Worst of all was when it\r\nbecame warm enough for it to thaw, and then the snow that had melted\r\ninto water would freeze when the night came. Then there would be a\r\nthin layer of ice which you could easily slip on. It would also often\r\nbreak, so that the sharp splinters would cut the deers\xe2\x80\x99 tender\r\nfetlocks, cut them bloody. But now there was a hard frost which had\r\nlasted for days. The air was clean and thin such as it never had been\r\nbefore and the frost was full of strength. It began to tinkle with a\r\nsound that was fine and high. It was so cold that the air sang.\r\n\r\nEverything was quiet in the forest, but something shocking happened\r\nevery day. One time, the crows attacked the hare\xe2\x80\x99s little son, who was\r\nalready lying down ill, and killed him in a gruesome way. His cries of\r\npain were long and pitiful and could be heard by all. Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s friend,\r\nthe hare, was away at the time but when he heard the sad news he could\r\nnot contain himself. Another time, the squirrel was running around\r\nwith a serious wound on his neck from where the polecat had bitten\r\nhim. By some miracle the squirrel had been able to get away from\r\nhim. He could not speak because of the pain but he ran between all the\r\ntwigs and branches. Everyone could see it. He ran like a madman. From\r\ntime to time he would stop, sit down, raise his forepaws in confusion,\r\ntake hold of his head in his shock and his suffering, and as he did so\r\nhis blood gushed over his white breast and turned it red. He ran\r\naround like this for an hour, then he suddenly collapsed, fell hard\r\nagainst the branches of the tree and fell, dying, into the snow. A\r\npair of magpies immediately came down on him and began their\r\nfeasting. There was also the time when the fox attacked the pheasant\r\nand tore him to bits, even though everyone liked and respected the\r\npheasant for his beauty and his strength. His death was a cause for\r\nconcern far and wide, and everyone felt sorry for his inconsolable\r\nwidow. The fox had snatched the pheasant out of the snow he had\r\nsettled in and where he thought he was well hidden. No-one could feel\r\nsafe any more, as all these things happened in broad daylight. It\r\nseemed that the penury they were suffering would never come to an end,\r\nand it spread bitterness and ruthlessness all around. It made all\r\nexperience worthless, it undermined the conscience, destroyed all\r\ntrust and all good manners. There was no mercy any more, no peace, no\r\nholding back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s impossible even to think that it might ever get any better,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother sighed.\r\n\r\nAuntie Ena sighed too. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to think that it ever was\r\nany better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be silly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marena looking straight ahead. \xe2\x80\x9cI think about\r\nhow lovely it used to be all the time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Nettla said to Auntie Ena. \xe2\x80\x9cYour little one is\r\nshivering, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he!\xe2\x80\x9d And she pointed to Gobo. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes he always shiver\r\nlike that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSad to say,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Auntie Ena, somewhat worried, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nshivering like that for several days now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Nettla in the open way she had of saying\r\nthings, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only glad I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got any children any more. If he was\r\nmy little one I\xe2\x80\x99d be worried about whether he gets through the\r\nwinter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGobo indeed did not look well. He was weak, he had always been less\r\nstrong than Bambi or Faline and had not grown as fast as those\r\ntwo. But now, he looked worse from day to day. He could not keep his\r\nfood down, what little there was of it now. He was in continual\r\npain. So, with the cold and the difficulties of life, he had lost all\r\nof what strength he had. He shivered all the time and could barely\r\nhold himself upright. Everyone looked at him with concern.\r\n\r\nMrs. Nettla went to him and gave him a friendly push in the side. \xe2\x80\x9cNow\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you be sad,\xe2\x80\x9d she told him sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not right for a young\r\nprince and it\xe2\x80\x99s bad for your health.\xe2\x80\x9d She moved away from him because\r\nshe did not want anyone to see how concerned she was.\r\n\r\nRonno was sitting in the snow to one side, but now he jumped up. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what that is ...,\xe2\x80\x9d he mumbled and looked all around.\r\n\r\nEveryone paid attention. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat what is ...?\xe2\x80\x9d they all asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t really know,\xe2\x80\x9d Ronno repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m worried ... all of a\r\nsudden I\xe2\x80\x99m worried. It\xe2\x80\x99s as if there were something wrong ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKarus had tested the air. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t smell anything odd,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared.\r\n\r\nThey all stood there, listening, and testing the air. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing!,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t smell anything ...,\xe2\x80\x9d they all said, one after the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut still!\xe2\x80\x9d Ronno persisted. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can say what you like ... but there\r\nis something wrong ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe crows have been calling ...\xe2\x80\x9d said Marena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re calling again now!\xe2\x80\x9d added Faline quickly, but by now the\r\nothers had heard them too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, that\xe2\x80\x99s them, flying!,\xe2\x80\x9d Karus pointed out to the others.\r\n\r\nEveryone looked up. Above the tops of the trees, crows were flying\r\naway in swarms. They came inwards from the outermost edge of the\r\nwoods, from wherever it was that the danger was approaching, and spoke\r\nanxiously to each other up there. It was clear that there was an\r\nexceptional disturbance of some sort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I right?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ronno. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can see that there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsomething going on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are we to do?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother uneasily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet away from here, now!\xe2\x80\x9d insisted Auntie Ena in alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait!\xe2\x80\x9d commanded Ronno.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait? With all the children here?\xe2\x80\x9d Auntie Ena contradicted him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Gobo won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to run?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlright then,\xe2\x80\x9d Ronno conceded \xe2\x80\x9cYou get away from here with your\r\nchildren. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any point in it, of course, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nhave you blaming me for it later.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was serious and decisive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGobo, Faline, come this way! Not too fast! Go slowly! Stay behind\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d Auntie Ena admonished them. She, with her children, slipped away.\r\n\r\nA time went by. They stood still, listening and smelling the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all we need,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Nettla began. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to put up with all\r\nof this and now, this is all we need!\xe2\x80\x9d She was very cross. Bambi\r\nlooked at her and felt that she was thinking of something dreadful.\r\n\r\nNow the magpies were also coming out of the same part of the thicket\r\nas the crows had come, three or four at a time. \xe2\x80\x9cLook out, look out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthey cried. They still could not be seen, but their loud warnings\r\ncould be heard one after another: \xe2\x80\x9cLook out, look out!\xe2\x80\x9d Now they came\r\nnearer, continued to flap their wings, shocked and disturbed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHakh!\xe2\x80\x9d the jays cried, yapping loud in their alarm.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, and all at the same time, all the deer came together. It had\r\nseared through them as if they had been hit by something. Now they\r\nstood still and breathed heavily.\r\n\r\nIt was Him.\r\n\r\nThere was a frenzy of smelling the air like never before. There was\r\nnow nothing left to examine. The smell entered their noses, befogged\r\ntheir senses and made their hearts freeze.\r\n\r\nThe magpies were still playing about, the jays above them were\r\nyapping, but now there was agitated movement everywhere. The tits\r\nswished between the branches, hundreds of little feathery balls, and\r\nthey chirruped \xe2\x80\x9caway, away!\xe2\x80\x9d The blackbirds rushed dark and\r\nlightning-fast above the trees, with long drawn out screams of\r\nchirping as they flew. The deer looked down at the white snow through\r\nthe network of bare twigs on the bushes, and saw a confused rush of\r\nsmall shadowy figures as they ran to and fro. They were the\r\npheasants. Further away there was a shimmer of red. That was actually\r\nthe fox, but no-one was afraid of him now, for continuous, broad waves\r\nof that dreadful smell wafted to them, breathing alarm into their\r\nminds and uniting them all into one crazy fear and into one feverish\r\ndesire to flee, to save themselves.\r\n\r\nThis mysterious, overpowering scent permeated the wood with such power\r\nthat they could tell that He was not alone this time but seemed to\r\nhave come with all His friends, and things were at their most extreme.\r\n\r\nThey did not move, they watched the tits as they hurried away with\r\nfrantic flapping of their wings, The blackbirds, the squirrels rushed\r\naway leaping from one tree top to another; they thought these little\r\nones had no good reason to be afraid, but they nonetheless understood\r\nwhy they fled when He could be smelt. There was no creature in the\r\nforest who could bear to have Him anywhere near.\r\n\r\nNow our friend, the hare, hopped away hesitantly, sat still, and\r\nhopped further.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does it look?\xe2\x80\x9d Karus called to him, impatiently.\r\n\r\nBut our friend, the hare, just looked around, madness in his eyes, and\r\ncould not speak straight away. He was very disturbed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the point of asking ...\xe2\x80\x9d said Ronno grimly.\r\n\r\nOur friend the hare gasped for breath. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are surrounded,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in\r\na monotone. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no way out on any side. He is everywhere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust then they heard His voice. Twenty times, thirty times He called\r\nout. Hoho! Haha! It rang out and shook them more than thunder and\r\nlightning. It struck the trunks of the trees which trumpeted the sound\r\nout. It brought them horror, it threw them down. A distant rustling\r\nand cracking of the undergrowth as the bushes were pushed apart and\r\nthe sound forced itself over to them, the screams and bangs of twigs\r\nas they broke.\r\n\r\nHe was coming! He was coming right here, into the thicket.\r\n\r\nNow, behind them, they could hear short whistles and trills. Already,\r\nthere was a pheasant there standing up as he heard His steps. They\r\nheard the flapping of the pheasant\xe2\x80\x99s wings fading as he rose high into\r\nthe air. A flash and a clap of thunder. Quiet. Then the muffled sound\r\nof something hitting the ground. \xe2\x80\x9cThe pheasant has fallen,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother with a shudder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first ...\xe2\x80\x9d added Ronno.\r\n\r\nThen Marena, the young girl, spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are many of us who are\r\ngoing to die very soon. I might be one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d No-one listened to\r\nher. Now the great terror was among them.\r\n\r\nBambi tried to think. But the raging noise, which He was raising\r\nhigher and higher, tore all his thoughts apart. Bambi could hear\r\nnothing but this noise, a noise that made you numb, and in among all\r\nthis howling, bellowing and banging he could hear the thump of his own\r\nheart. All he felt was curiosity and was completely unaware that all\r\nhis limbs were shaking. Now and then his mother came close to his ear\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cStay with me.\xe2\x80\x9d She shouted, but in all that uproar it\r\nseemed to Bambi that she was whispering. This \xe2\x80\x9cStay with me\xe2\x80\x9d offered\r\nhim some support. It held him fast as if he were held in place with a\r\nchain, otherwise he would have run away without a second thought, and\r\nhe always heard it again just when he would have lost self control\r\nfled. He looked around. There was a crowd of many different people\r\nrunning around in a blind panic between each other. A pair of weasels\r\nran past, slender lines like a snake which it nearly impossible to\r\nfollow with the eye. A polecat listened spellbound for all the\r\ninformation he could get from the stuttering, confused hare. The fox\r\nstood there among the disordered rush of the pheasants. They paid no\r\nattention to him, ran right past his nose, and he paid no attention to\r\nthem. Without becoming excited, his head stretched forward, his ears\r\npointing up high, his nose working hard, he strained himself to hear\r\nthrough the tumult as it came closer. The only thing moving was his\r\ntail. It looked as if he were straining to think. A pheasant hurried\r\npast, out from behind, out of the most serious danger, and he was in a\r\npanic. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go up there!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted to the other birds. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\nup there ... just run! Don\xe2\x80\x99t let them get you! Nobody go up there!\r\nJust run, run, run!\xe2\x80\x9d He kept on repeating the same thing, as if he\r\nwere trying to warn himself. But he no longer knew what he was\r\nsaying. A clamour of \xe2\x80\x9cHoho! Haha!\xe2\x80\x9d seemed to come from somewhere quite\r\nclose. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let them get you!\xe2\x80\x9d called the pheasant. At the same time\r\nhis voice suddenly became a whistle-like sobbing, with a loud rattle\r\nhe spread his wings and flew upwards. Bambi watched him as he went,\r\nflapping his wings loudly, flying up directly and steeply between the\r\ntrees, his resplendent body glittering with its metallic dark blue,\r\ngold-brown sheen, as majestic as a precious gem. His long tail\r\nfeathers swept proudly behind him like the train of a gown. The curt\r\nthunderclap rang out sharp. The pheasant in the sky collapsed suddenly\r\ninto himself, twisted himself round as if trying to snap at his feet\r\nwith his beak, and hurtled heavily to the ground. He fell in the\r\nmiddle of the others and moved no more.\r\n\r\nNow no-one was able to stay calm. They all rushed around away from\r\neach other. Five, six pheasants rose into the air with noisy\r\nclattering. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go up there\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the others as they ran. The\r\nthunderclap came again, five times, six times, and some of those who\r\nhad flown up in the air fell back to the ground lifeless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, come with me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother. Bambi looked up. Ronno and\r\nKarus had already gone. Mrs. Nettla had also disappeared. Only Marena\r\nwas still with them. Bambi went with his mother. Marena demurely\r\nfollowed them. All around them there was upheaval, loud cracks,\r\nbellowing and thunderclaps. Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother stayed calm. She was\r\ntrembling, just slightly, but she kept her thoughts together. \xe2\x80\x9cBambi,\r\nmy child\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9calways stay right behind me. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get out\r\nof here and across the clearing. But here inside we need to go\r\nslowly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bellowing became more hurried. The thunderclaps came ten, twelve\r\ntimes, thrown out from the hands of Him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop that\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s mother. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t run! Once we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone past the\r\nclearing then run, run as fast as you can. And Bambi, my child, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nforget, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pay me any attention once we\xe2\x80\x99ve reached the\r\noutside. Even if I fall, pay me no attention ... just keep going, keep\r\ngoing! Do you understand, Bambi?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis mother made deliberate steps through the booming noise. The\r\npheasants ran in all directions, pressed themselves into the snow,\r\njumped out again, started to run once more. The whole family of the\r\nhare jumped here and there, sat down, ran again. No-one spoke a\r\nword. There were all exhausted with their fear, crippled by all the\r\nbellowing and by the thunderclaps.\r\n\r\nAhead of Bambi and his mother it was getting lighter. Through the\r\ncage-work of the bushes shone the clearing. Behind them, getting\r\ncloser and closer, there were startling bangs that rattled on the tree\r\ntrunks, the cracking of twigs as they broke, the yells of haha, and\r\nhoho!\r\n\r\nNow their friend the hare with his two young rushed past close beside\r\nthem and into the clearing. Bang! Ping! Bam! the thunder\r\ncrashed. Bambi saw the hare did a somersault as he ran, and fell with\r\nhis pale belly facing upwards and then just lay there. He twitched a\r\nfew times, and then he was still. Bambi stood there as if made of\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nBut from behind he heard shouts of, \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re there! Everyone, just get\r\nout!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA widespread rustling of wings as they hurriedly unfurled, whistling,\r\nsobbing, swoosh of foliage, flapping. The pheasants rose up, lifted\r\nthemselves up almost all at the same time like the straw in a\r\nsheaf. The air burst with many thunderclaps, and the muffled impact of\r\nthe fallen could be heard as they hit the ground, the fine whistling\r\nof the survivors rang out as they flew away.\r\n\r\nBambi stopped and looked back. There He was. He was coming out from\r\nthe undergrowth, here and there and there again. He was appearing\r\neverywhere, striking everywhere, damaging the bushes, drumming on the\r\ntree trunks and shouting terrifying cries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow!\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother. \xe2\x80\x9cStraight ahead. And don\xe2\x80\x99t come too close\r\nbehind me!\xe2\x80\x9d With one leap she was out of the woods, so that the snow\r\nmerely threw up a few flakes. Bambi hurried after her. They were\r\nattacked by the sound of thunder from every side. It was as if the\r\nEarth had been ripped in half. Bambi saw nothing. He ran. The urge to\r\nget away from this tumult had been accumulating, away from the steam\r\nof the storm that whipped everything up, from the gathering urgency to\r\nflee, the wish to save himself, all these were now unleashed. He\r\nran. It seemed to him that he saw his mother fall, although he did not\r\nknow whether she really had done. He felt a veil around his eyes. It\r\nhad been thrown over him by the fear of the thunderclaps, booming all\r\naround him, which had now broken out. He was unable to think, unable\r\nto see, he ran.\r\n\r\nThe clearing was now behind him. A new thicket took him in. From\r\nbehind him came another shout, another sharp thunderclap, and in the\r\ntwigs above there was a very brief rattling, like a first spray of\r\nhailstones. Then it became quieter. Bambi ran. A pheasant with a\r\ntwisted neck lay dying on the snow, twitching his wings weakly. As he\r\nheard Bambi approach he stopped his spasmodic movements and whispered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s finished ...\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi paid him no attention and continued\r\nrunning. He found himself in a tangle of undergrowth that forced him\r\nto slow his pace and look for a path. He kicked around himself\r\nimpatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cOver here,\xe2\x80\x9d called somebody in a broken voice. Bambi had\r\nno choice but to follow it, and immediately found himself in a place\r\nwhere he could walk. But in front of him somebody was struggling to\r\nget to her feet. It was the hare\xe2\x80\x99s wife. It was her who had\r\ncalled. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think you could give me a little help?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\nBambi looked at her and was shocked. Her rear legs dragged lifeless\r\nthrough the snow which was red and beginning to melt from the warm\r\nblood that dropped from her. She said once again, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think you\r\ncould give me a little help?\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke as if she were perfectly\r\nalright, relaxed and almost gay. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s happened to me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe continued, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not anything important ... but at the\r\nmoment ... I can\xe2\x80\x99t walk ...\xe2\x80\x9d As she spoke she sank down onto her side\r\nand she was dead. Bambi, once again, was horrified and he ran away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBambi!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped abruptly. That was one of his own people.\r\n\r\nIt was heard again, \xe2\x80\x9cBambi ... is it you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was Gobo stuck helplessly in the snow. He had no strength at all\r\nand could not even get onto his feet. He lay there as if he had been\r\nburied and merely raised his head weakly. Bambi went over to him in\r\nsome agitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s your mother, Gobo?\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped, \xe2\x80\x9cand where\xe2\x80\x99s Faline?\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi\r\nspoke quickly, agitated and impatient. In his anxiety his heart\r\ncontinued to beat hard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother and Faline had to go,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Gobo in despair. He spoke\r\ngently, but as earnest and as wise as a grownup. \xe2\x80\x9cThey had to leave me\r\nlying here. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had it. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go too, Bambi.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet up!\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi yelled. \xe2\x80\x9cGobo, get up! You\xe2\x80\x99ve been resting long\r\nenough. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t any more time for that! Get up! Come with me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, just leave it, Bambi,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Gobo quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t stand\r\nup. It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible. I wish I could come with you, you know that, but\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m just too weak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen to you then?\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi persisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I expect I\xe2\x80\x99ll die,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gobo simply.\r\n\r\nThe shouting started again and the sound of it came over to\r\nthem. Between the shouts, new thunderclaps. Bambi was alarmed. There\r\nwere rapid bangs and cracks from the undergrowth, rumblings sped\r\nacross the snow, and in among the uproar young Karus came galloping\r\nover to them. \xe2\x80\x9cRun!\xe2\x80\x9d he called when he saw Bambi there. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t just\r\nstand there, anyone who still can run, run!\xe2\x80\x9d He went past them in an\r\ninstant and his headlong flight yanked Bambi along with him. Bambi was\r\nhardly aware whether he had started running again or not, and it was\r\nonly a while later that he said, \xe2\x80\x9cFarewell, Gobo.\xe2\x80\x9d But by that time he\r\nwas already too far away. Gobo could no longer hear him.\r\n\r\nHe ran through the woods, penetrated by the noise and the thunderclaps\r\nthat seemed to be seeking him out, he ran around until it was evening.\r\nWhen darkness swept down it became quiet. There was soon a light wind\r\nblowing, helping to blow away that horrible storm that had been raging\r\nfar and wide. But the terror remained. The first person Bambi saw whom\r\nhe knew was Ronno. His limp was worse than ever. \xe2\x80\x9cOver there, where\r\nthe oaks are,\xe2\x80\x9d Ronno said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe fox is there, lying wounded. I\xe2\x80\x99ve just\r\ncome past him. It\xe2\x80\x99s terrible, the way he\xe2\x80\x99s suffering. He\xe2\x80\x99s biting at\r\nthe snow and in the earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen my mother?\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ronno shyly, and he quickly went away.\r\n\r\nLater in the night Bambi came across Mrs. Nettla with Faline. All\r\nthree were very glad to see each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen my mother?\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Faline. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t even know where my mother is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Nettla cheerfully, \xe2\x80\x9cand that\xe2\x80\x99s a fine mess for me. I\r\nwas glad when I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to put up with children any more, and now\r\nsuddenly I\xe2\x80\x99ve got two of them I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to look after. Thanks a lot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi and Faline laughed.\r\n\r\nThey start talking about Gobo. Bambi told them about how he had found\r\nhim, and that made them so sad that they began to cry. But Mrs. Nettla\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow them to cry. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to see that the most important\r\nthing now is to find something to eat. It\xe2\x80\x99s unheard of! We haven\xe2\x80\x99t had\r\na bite to eat all day.\xe2\x80\x9d She led the two of them to a place where there\r\nwas still some greenery, hanging low and still not quite dried\r\nout. Mrs. Nettla was exceptionally well-informed. She did not touch\r\nanything herself but urged Bambi and Faline to take a good meal. At\r\nplaces where she knew there was grass she pushed the snow aside and\r\nordered them, \xe2\x80\x9cHere ... here is a good place,\xe2\x80\x9d or she would say, \xe2\x80\x9cWait\r\n... we can soon find something better than this.\xe2\x80\x9d But between giving\r\nthis advice she would grumble, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is so stupid! Children are so\r\nmuch trouble!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly they saw Auntie Ena coming and they ran up to her. \xe2\x80\x9cAuntie\r\nEna!\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi exclaimed. He was the first to have seen her. Faline was\r\nbeside herself with joy and jumped up to her. \xe2\x80\x9cMother!\xe2\x80\x9d But Ena was\r\ncrying, and she was dead tired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve lost Gobo,\xe2\x80\x9d she lamented. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking for him ... I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen to his sleeping place, out there in the snow where he collapsed\r\n... it was empty ... he\xe2\x80\x99s gone ... my poor little Gobo ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Nettla grumbled, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d do better to try to find out which way he\r\nwent, that would be more sensible than crying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no tracks to show which way he went,\xe2\x80\x9d said Auntie Ena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut ... He! ... He left lots of tracks ... He was there where Gobo\r\nwas sleeping ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were all silent. Then Bambi asked timidly, \xe2\x80\x9cAuntie Ena ... have\r\nyou seen my mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Auntie Ena, quietly.\r\n\r\nBambi was never to see his mother again.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12\r\n\r\nThe meadow had long since lost its catkins. Everything began to turn\r\ngreen, although the young leaves on the bushes and the trees were\r\nstill small. Shimmering in the tender light of early morning they\r\nshowed a smiling freshness and seemed like little children when they\r\nhave just woken up.\r\n\r\nBambi stood in front of a hazel bush, striking his new crown against\r\nthe wood. That was so enjoyable. And it was also necessary, as the\r\nglory of his head was still wrapped in velvet and fur. They had to\r\ncome off, that was a matter of course; and no-one with any sense of\r\ntidiness would just wait for them to fall off by themselves. Bambi\r\nswept his crown so that the coating of velvet was torn into shreds,\r\nand long strips of it dangled around his ears. While he struck up and\r\ndown at the hazel bush he felt that his crown was harder than it had\r\nbeen. This feeling permeated his whole being and gave him an\r\ninebriating sense of pride and strength. He pushed himself harder\r\nagainst the bush and this coating was torn off in long pieces. The\r\nnaked, white wood could be seen, and in the unfamiliar open air it\r\nquickly turned a rusty red. Bambi was not able to care about that. He\r\nsaw the pale flesh of the wood flash up under his movements, and that\r\nenchanted him. Here in this round place there were many other hazel\r\nbushes and dogwood bushes that showed the marks of his efforts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you nearly finished then ...?\xe2\x80\x9d said a cheerful voice from\r\nnearby.\r\n\r\nBambi threw his head up and looked around.\r\n\r\nThere sat the squirrel with a friendly look on his face.\r\n\r\nBambi and the squirrel were nearly startled by the woodpecker who,\r\nsitting close in to the trunk of the oak tree, called down, \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nplease excuse me ... I always \xe2\x80\x98ave to laugh when I see the two of you\r\nlike that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it then that\xe2\x80\x99s making you laugh so loudly?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bambi\r\npolitely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the woodpecker, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re doing the whole thing\r\nwrong. For one thing, you ought to have chosen a tree that\xe2\x80\x99s stronger,\r\nyou won\xe2\x80\x99t get anything from a thin little hazel bush.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat should I be getting, then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bambi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeetles ...\xe2\x80\x9d the woodpecker laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cBeetles and grubs ... Look,\r\nthis is how you do it!\xe2\x80\x9d He drummed on trunk of the oak. Tok, tok, tok,\r\ntok.\r\n\r\nThe squirrel rushed up to him and quarrelsomely asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you\r\nthink you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about? The prince isn\xe2\x80\x99t looking for beetles and\r\ngrubs ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the woodpecker complacently. They taste delicious ...\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe bit into a beetle, swallowed it, and went on drumming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d the squirrel scolded again. \xe2\x80\x9cA noble gentleman\r\nlike this has other, higher goals to pursue. You just make yourself\r\nlook ridiculous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter to me,\xe2\x80\x9d the woodpecker replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care a\r\nthing about these higher goals of yours,\xe2\x80\x9d he called cheerfully and\r\nflew away.\r\n\r\nThe squirrel scampered back down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, looking very satisfied with himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I do know you,\xe2\x80\x9d was Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s friendly answer. \xe2\x80\x9cYou live up\r\nthere ...\xe2\x80\x9d And he indicated the oak tree above them.\r\n\r\nThe squirrel looked at him with a grin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re confusing me with my\r\ngrandmother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew it. I knew you were confusing me with\r\nmy grandmother. My grandmother lived up there ever since she was a\r\nchild, Prince Bambi. She often told me about you. Only ... only then\r\nshe was killed by the polecat ... a long time ago, that was ... in the\r\nwintertime ... don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cI heard about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then ... and after that my father moved in here,\xe2\x80\x9d the squirrel\r\ntold him. He sat up, showed astonishment in his eyes, and held both\r\nhis paws politely on his white breast. \xe2\x80\x9cBut ... you might also be\r\nconfusing me with my father. Did you know my father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid not,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI never did have that pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I thought!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the squirrel in satisfaction. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nfather was so surly and shy. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any contact with anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he now?\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said the squirrel, \xe2\x80\x9ca month ago the owl got him. Yes. And now\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s me who lives up here. I\xe2\x80\x99m very satisfied with it. Just think, it\r\nwas up here that I was born.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi began to turn and was about to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait,\xe2\x80\x9d called the squirrel quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t really mean to tell you\r\nall that stuff. I wanted to say something completely different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi stayed where he was. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that then?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked patiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah ... what was that?\xe2\x80\x9d The squirrel thought about it, then made\r\nanother sudden leap, sat upright leaning against his magnificent bushy\r\ntail, and looked at Bambi. \xe2\x80\x9cRight! Now I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued to\r\nburble. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to tell you that you\xe2\x80\x99ll soon be ready with that\r\ncrown of yours, and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be very beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bambi, pleased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d declared the squirrel, and in his enthusiasm he pressed\r\nboth his forepaws against his white breast. \xe2\x80\x9cSo high! So majestic! And\r\nsuch long, bright points! You don\xe2\x80\x99t often find them like that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi asked. He became so pleased that he went back to the\r\nhazel bush and started striking at it for a little while longer. The\r\nvelvet was thrown around into the air in long strands.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the squirrel went on speaking. \xe2\x80\x9cI really must say that\r\nothers of your age don\xe2\x80\x99t have a crown as magnificent as yours. You\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s possible. Anyone who knew you last summer \xe2\x80\x93 and I\r\ndid catch sight of you a few times in the distance - probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve you\xe2\x80\x99re the same deer ... such thin little sticks you had in\r\nthose days ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi suddenly stopped. \xe2\x80\x9cGoodbye,\xe2\x80\x9d he said hurriedly, \xe2\x80\x9cI have to go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd he ran off.\r\n\r\nHe did not like being reminded of the previous summer. It had been a\r\ndifficult time for him. First of all, after his mother had disappeared\r\nhe had felt totally abandoned. The winter had been so long, the spring\r\ncame hesitantly and it was a long time before anything green\r\nappeared. Without Mrs. Nettla Bambi would not have been able to\r\nmanage, but she had taken him in and helped him in every way she\r\ncould. Nonetheless, he often found himself alone. He missed Gobo all\r\nthe time, poor Gobo, who must now be dead, like the others. Gobo was\r\ncontinually on his mind at this time, and it was only too late that he\r\nrealized how lovable and he had been. He rarely saw Faline. She always\r\nstayed close to her mother, and turned out to be remarkably\r\nshy. Later, when, at last, it had become warm, Bambi began to recover\r\nhis mood. He wiped his first crown clean of its velvet and was very\r\nproud of it. But a bitter disappointment was soon to follow. The other\r\ncrown-wearers chased him away whenever they saw him. They pushed him\r\naway angrily, they would not tolerate him going close to anyone,\r\nmishandled him, until, with every step he took, he was afraid of being\r\nfound by them, afraid of being seen anywhere, and he crept along the\r\nmost hidden paths with a feeling of being oppressed. At the same time,\r\nwhile the days became warmer and sunnier, he became gripped by a\r\nstrange unease. His heart became ever more oppressed with a yearning\r\nthat was both painful and welcome. Whenever he happened to see Faline\r\nor one of her friends in the distance he was overcome by a storm of\r\nexcitement that he could not understand. It even happened quite often\r\nthat that he would recognize just a trace of where she had been, or\r\nthat he would draw in breath to test the air and smell that she was\r\nnearby. He felt irresistibly drawn to her ever more often. But if he\r\ngave in to this longing that drew him to her it always turned out\r\nbadly. Either he would find no-one and in the end, tired out after\r\nwandering about for so long, have to acknowledge that the others were\r\navoiding him, or he came across one of the crowned heads, who would\r\nimmediately leap out at him, hit him, push him and drive him away,\r\nshouting insults. Worst of all, Ronno and Karus had taken against\r\nhim. No, that was not a happy time.\r\n\r\nAnd now the squirrel had stupidly reminded him of it. He suddenly\r\nbecame quite wild and began to run. The tits and the wrens flew out of\r\nthe bushes in alarm as he went past them and asked each other\r\nurgently, \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that then ... Who was that?\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi did not hear\r\nthem. A pair of magpies laughed nervously, \xe2\x80\x9cHas something happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe jay was cross and shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi paid him no\r\nattention. Above him the oriole flew from tree to tree, \xe2\x80\x9cGood morning\r\n... I\xe2\x80\x99m ... hap-hap-happy!\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi made no answer. All around him the\r\nthicket was already light and the rays of the sun ran through it in\r\nfine beams. Bambi did not bother about that. There was a sudden loud\r\nrattling sound from near his feet; a whole rainbow of gorgeous colours\r\nflashed up and shone into his eyes so that he was dazzled and he\r\nstopped. It was Janello, the pheasant, who had shot into the air in\r\nstartlement because Bambi had nearly stepped on him. He rushed away,\r\nscolding Bambi as he went. \xe2\x80\x9cUnheard of!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted in his cracked,\r\ncrow-like voice. Bambi was bewildered and watched him go. \xe2\x80\x9cWell it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nturned out alright, but you really were being very careless ...\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\na soft, twittering voice from nearby on the ground. It was Janelline,\r\nthe pheasant\xe2\x80\x99s wife. She sat, brooding, on the ground. My husband was\r\nterribly alarmed,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, dissatisfied, \xe2\x80\x9cand so was I. But I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t move from this spot ... I can\xe2\x80\x99t move from this spot whatever\r\nhappens ... you could very easily have trodden on me ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi was slightly ashamed. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d he stuttered, \xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npaying attention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJanelline answered, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, please! Maybe it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite that bad. But\r\nmy husband and I, we\xe2\x80\x99re so nervous at present. You understand ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi understood nothing at all and went on his way. He had become\r\ncalmer now. All around him the wood was singing. The light became\r\nwarmer and more golden, the leaves on the bushes, the grass on the\r\nground and steam rising from the damp earth took on a sharp\r\naroma. Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s youthful strength swelled up in him and stretched out\r\ninto all his limbs so that he became quite stiff, his movements became\r\nhesitant as if he were something artificial.\r\n\r\nHe went over to a small elder bush and, lifting his knees high into\r\nthe air, he struck against the ground with powerful blows so that\r\nclods of earth flew up from it. His fine, sharp, cloven hoof cut the\r\ngrass away that was growing here, wild peas and wild leeks, violets\r\nand snowdrops, he scraped them all away till the earth lay before him\r\nquite dashed and bare. With each blow a dull thump could be heard.\r\n\r\nBambi caught the attention of two moles who had been tumbling around\r\nat the roots of an old privet bush. They looked up and watched\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cBut ... that\xe2\x80\x99s just ridiculous, what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered one\r\nof them. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not how you dig ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other raised the fine corners of his mouth into a jeering grin.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got no idea ... that\xe2\x80\x99s obvious ... But that\xe2\x80\x99s what you get when\r\npeople do things they don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi suddenly stopped, lifted his head up high, listened, and looked\r\naround at the undergrowth. There was a flash of red between the twigs,\r\nit was unclear, but he could make out the points of a crown. Bambi\r\nsnorted. Whoever it was creeping about there, Ronno or Karus or anyone\r\nelse \xe2\x80\x93 go at him! I\xe2\x80\x99ll show him I\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid of them any more, he\r\nthought! It was as if he had suddenly been taken over by his own\r\nexhilaration. I\xe2\x80\x99ll show them that I\xe2\x80\x99m the one they should be afraid\r\nof!\r\n\r\nHe ran into the bushes with such force that they rattled, the branches\r\ncracked and broke. Now, Bambi could see the other deer in front of\r\nhim. He was not able to recognize him because everything was swimming\r\nin front of his eyes. He could think of nothing but that he should go\r\nat him! With his crown lowered deep he stormed forward, gathering all\r\nhis strength into his neck, ready to strike. He could already smell\r\nhis opponent\xe2\x80\x99s hairy coat, could already see nothing in front of him\r\nbut the red wall of his flank. Then the other made a very gentle\r\nmovement. Bambi had expected him to stay still but he was robbed of\r\nthis advantage when he rushed at him his antlers met nothing but thin\r\nair. He nearly fell over, but he staggered, pulled himself together,\r\nand swung back round to renew his attack.\r\n\r\nThe he saw who the elder was.\r\n\r\nBambi was so surprised he lost control of himself. He would have been\r\nashamed to simply run from the spot, although that was what he most\r\nwanted to do. And he was ashamed to stay. He did not move.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this then?\xe2\x80\x9d the elder asked quietly. His deep voice, at the\r\nsame time so relaxed and so imperious, drove itself, as it always did,\r\nstraight through the centre of Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s heart. He remained silent.\r\n\r\nThe elder asked again, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s all this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ... I thought,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Bambi. \xe2\x80\x9cI th ... thought it was Ronno or\r\n...\xe2\x80\x9d He became silent and dared to look shyly at the elder, and as he\r\nlooked he became even more bewildered.\r\n\r\nThe aged one stood there, motionless and powerful. His head had, by\r\nnow, turned perfectly white, and his dark, proud eyes shone from their\r\ndepths.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not against me ...?\xe2\x80\x9d the aged one asked.\r\n\r\nBambi looked at him, filled with a remarkable enthusiasm and\r\nshuddering with a mysterious thrill. He wanted to call out, \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I\r\nlove you!\xe2\x80\x9d But, instead, he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe aged one looked at him. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen you for a long time.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve grown big and strong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi gave no answer. He trembled with joy.\r\n\r\nThe elder continued, he wanted to test him and make his assessment of\r\nhim. Then, surprisingly, he stepped very close to Bambi, causing Bambi\r\nmuch alarm. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever you do, do it with nobility ...,\xe2\x80\x9d the aged one\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHe turned away, and in the next moment he was gone. Bambi remained on\r\nthe same spot for a long time afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13\r\n\r\nIt was summertime and burning hot. The yearning began to rise again in\r\nBambi, the yearning that he had felt earlier, but this time it was\r\nmuch stronger than before, it boiled his blood and made him restless.\r\n\r\nHe wandered far and wide.\r\n\r\nOne day, he came across Faline. He had not expected to find her at\r\nall, for his thoughts were at that time very confused from all the\r\nrestless yearning that had possessed him, and he had not realized she\r\nwas there. Now she was standing in front of him. For a while he was\r\nspeechless and merely stared at her, then, awestruck, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cFaline\r\n... you\xe2\x80\x99ve become so beautiful ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFaline retorted, \xe2\x80\x9cCan you still recognize me then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I can still recognize you!\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cWe grew up\r\ntogether, didn\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFaline sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been so long since we saw each other.\xe2\x80\x9d And then\r\nshe added, \xe2\x80\x9cPeople can become complete strangers to each other,\xe2\x80\x9d but\r\nshe said it in a teasing way, simple and elegant, like she had used to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nThey remained together, where they were.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis path here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi after a long pause, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is the path I\r\nused to go along with my mother when I was a child...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt leads to the meadow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Faline.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was on the meadow that I first saw you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi, almost gaily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Faline answered, \xe2\x80\x9cme and Gobo.\xe2\x80\x9d She sighed gently. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Gobo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi repeated her. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Gobo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they began to talk about those days and frequently asked each\r\nother, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d It turned out, to their delight, that they\r\nboth remembered everything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut there, on the meadow,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi recalled, \xe2\x80\x9cwe played tag ...\r\nremember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we did ...,\xe2\x80\x9d said Faline, and then she jumped away in a\r\nflash. At first Bambi just stood there, wondering what had happened,\r\nbut then he rushed after her. \xe2\x80\x9cWait! Wait for me!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted gaily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to wait,\xe2\x80\x9d Faline teased him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in a tremendous\r\nhurry!\xe2\x80\x9d And in short leaps she curved her way far across the bushes\r\nand grass. Finally, Bambi caught up with her, blocked her way, and\r\nthen they stood quietly together. They laughed, and were very\r\ncontented.\r\n\r\nFaline suddenly jumped into the air as if something had stung her and\r\nleapt away again. Bambi rushed after her. Faline made a curve, and\r\nthen another, threw herself from side to side and got away from Bambi\r\ntime after time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay where you are!\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cJust stay where you are ... I\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nto ask you something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFaline stood still. She was curious and asked \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you need to ask\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well if you\xe2\x80\x99re just cheating ...\xe2\x80\x9d said Faline and was about to\r\nrun off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi quickly exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cStay there ... I want ... I want to\r\nask you ... do you love me, Faline?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with even more curiosity than before and felt\r\nslightly wary.\xe2\x80\x9d I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes you do,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must know! And I know it too, I can\r\nfeel it perfectly well that I love you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a furious love for\r\nyou, Faline. So now tell me, do you love me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe, it could well be that I\xe2\x80\x99m fond of you,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered casually.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will you stay with me?\xe2\x80\x9d enquired Bambi, becoming more excited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you ask me nicely\xe2\x80\x9d ... said Faline gaily.\r\n\r\nBambi lost control of himself and exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI am asking you, Faline!\r\nMy love, my beautiful Faline, do you hear me? I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you with all\r\nmy heart!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I certainly will stay with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Faline softly \xe2\x80\x93 and then\r\nshe was gone.\r\n\r\nEnchanted, Bambi shot off again in pursuit of her. Faline swept across\r\nthe meadow, turned sharply and disappeared into a thicket. But when\r\nBambi also turned suddenly in order to follow her there was a stormy\r\nrustling in the bushes, and out sprang Karus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d he called.\r\n\r\nBambi did not understand. He was too occupied with Faline. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me\r\npass,\xe2\x80\x9d he said hurriedly, \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t got the time for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo away from here!\xe2\x80\x9d Karus ordered him crossly. \xe2\x80\x9cGo away, now! If not\r\nI will hunt you down till there\xe2\x80\x99s not an ounce of breath left in\r\nyou. I forbid you to chase after Faline!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSlowly, Bambi began to remember the previous summer, when he was so\r\noften humiliated by being chased away. He suddenly became angry. He\r\nsaid not a word, but immediately lowered his crown and threw himself\r\nat Karus.\r\n\r\nHe hit him with such force than no-one could have resisted it and\r\nKarus was lying in the grass before he knew what had happened to him.\r\n\r\nHe got up again as fast as lightning, but he was barely back on his\r\nfeet when he was struck by another blow that left him reeling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBambi!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, and was about to shout a second time, \xe2\x80\x9cBam...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhen a third blow slid down from his shoulder and caused so much pain\r\nit took his breath away.\r\n\r\nKarus jumped to one side to avoid receiving yet another blow from\r\nBambi. He suddenly felt remarkably weak, and realized, to his disgust,\r\nthat this was now a matter of life and death. A cold fear took hold of\r\nhim. He turned to flee from Bambi who was rushing close behind, and\r\nrealized from Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s silence that in every sense, his anger and his\r\nruthlessness, he was determined to kill him. Karus fell into a\r\npanic. He turned away from the path, used the last of his strength to\r\nbreak through into the bushes, there was nothing he could wish for,\r\nnothing he could think of, other than to yearn for mercy or for\r\nrescue.\r\n\r\nBambi suddenly stopped and left him alone. Karus was so terrified that\r\nhe did not notice this and ran on through the bushes, as well as he\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nBut Bambi had stopped because he had heard the fine call of Faline. He\r\nlistened, there she called again, in fear, oppressed. He immediately\r\nturned round and hurried back.\r\n\r\nOnce he was back on the meadow he saw her just as she was fleeing into\r\nthe thicket, pursued by Ronno.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRonno!\xe2\x80\x9d called Bambi. He was not aware that he had called out.\r\n\r\nRonno was not able to run very fast because his limp held him back,\r\nand he stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, look who it is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a genteel tone, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s little Bambi!\r\nCan I help you in any way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi, calmly but in a voice that was distorted by the\r\nanger he was suppressing and the power he held back, \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to\r\nleave Faline alone and I want you to go away, immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, is that all?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ronno with contempt. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a cheeky young lad\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve turned into ... I never would have expected that of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRonno,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi even more gently, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s for your sake that I want\r\nit. Because if you don\xe2\x80\x99t go away now you will wish you could run away\r\non those legs of yours, but you won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to run away any more\r\n...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?!\xe2\x80\x9d Ronno called out crossly, \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a limp, is it? Is\r\nthat why you talk to me like that? You can hardly notice it anyway.\r\nOr perhaps, after seeing what a pitiful coward Karus was, you think\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m frightened of you. Let me tell you this ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Ronno,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi interrupted him, \xe2\x80\x9clet me tell you something: Go\r\nAway!\xe2\x80\x9d His voice quivered as he spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked you,\r\nRonno. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always thought you\xe2\x80\x99re very clever and I\xe2\x80\x99ve felt respect\r\nfor you because you\xe2\x80\x99re much older than me. But now I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you,\r\nfor the last time, go away ... I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got any more patience left\r\n...!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPity you\xe2\x80\x99ve got so little patience,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ronno with contempt. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\ngreat pity for you, lad. But now just calm down, I\xe2\x80\x99ll soon be finished\r\nwith you. You won\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait long. Or maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten how\r\nmany times I\xe2\x80\x99ve pushed you along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi had no words to put against this reminder and was no longer able\r\nto control himself. He rushed at Ronno like a madman, and Ronno\r\nreceived him with his head lowered. They crashed together. Ronno stood\r\nhis ground and wondered why Bambi did not back away. He was also\r\nastonished at this sudden attack, he had not expected Bambi to attack\r\nat all. He felt uncomfortable at Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s enormous strength and\r\nrealized he would need to pull himself together. They stood there,\r\npressed brow to brow, and Ronno decided he would use a trick. He\r\nbacked away suddenly so that Bambi lost his balance and tumbled over.\r\n\r\nBut Bambi raised himself on his hind legs and threw himself at Ronno\r\nwith twice as much fury, before Ronno had even found the time to stand\r\nfirm. There was a sharp crack as one of the branches of Ronno\xe2\x80\x99s crown\r\nbroke. He thought his entire forehead had been smashed. He saw stars\r\nin front of his eyes and heard a swishing in his ears. In the next\r\nmoment a powerful blow tore open his shoulder. He had no breath, he\r\nlay on the floor and Bambi stood angrily over him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me alone,\xe2\x80\x9d Ronno groaned.\r\n\r\nBambi continued to strike him anywhere he could. There was a gleam in\r\nhis eyes. He seemed to have no thought of showing any mercy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease ... just stop,\xe2\x80\x9d Ronno begged him, pitifully. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do know I\r\nwalk with a limp ... I was only making a joke ... spare me ... don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou understand a joke ...?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi, without a word, stopped his attack. With great effort, Ronno\r\nstood up. He was bleeding and he staggered. Without a word, he limped\r\naway.\r\n\r\nBambi was about to go into the thicket to find Faline, but then she\r\ncame out of it. She had been standing close to the edge of the trees\r\nand seen everything. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was wonderful,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a laugh. But\r\nthen she became serious and gently added, \xe2\x80\x9cI love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two of them went on their way together and they were very happy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14\r\n\r\nOne day they were deep in the woods looking for the little clearing\r\nwhere Bambi had last come across the elder. Bambi told Faline about\r\nhim with great enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll find him again, I really want to find him again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be nice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Faline perkily. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d really like to talk\r\nwith him some time.\xe2\x80\x9d But she was not telling the truth. She may well\r\nhave been curious, but in fact she was afraid of the elder.\r\n\r\nThe sky was already light grey, the sun was about to rise.\r\n\r\nThey ambled along next to each other into the place where the bushes\r\nand wild cabbages stood isolated from other vegetation, so that there\r\nwas a clear view in all directions. They heard a rustling not far\r\naway. They immediately stopped and looked in that direction. The stag\r\nstrode slowly and powerfully through the bushes and into the\r\nclearing. In the twilight it was not possible to see any colours, and\r\nhe appeared as an enormous grey shadow.\r\n\r\nFaline immediately screamed. Bambi took hold of himself. He was, of\r\ncourse, just as startled as Faline and her scream only made it worse,\r\nbut her voice had sounded so helpless that he felt pity for her and\r\nforced himself to reassure her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter then?\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered anxiously, but there was a\r\ntremble in his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter. He won\xe2\x80\x99t do us any harm!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFaline simply continued screaming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t get so upset, my love. It\xe2\x80\x99s not nice,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi urged her. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nridiculous to always be afraid of these gentlemen. They are relatives\r\nof ours, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Faline did not want to hear anything about their being\r\nrelatives. She stood there, very stiff, stared at the stag as he went\r\nunbothered on his way, and she screamed and screamed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPull yourself together,\xe2\x80\x9d scolded Bambi, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s he going to think of\r\nus?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was nothing that could have calmed Faline down. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can think\r\nwhat he wants,\xe2\x80\x9d she shouted, and went on screaming. \xe2\x80\x9cAh-oh! Ba-oh! ...\r\nnobody should ever be as big as that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe continued to scream, \xe2\x80\x9cBa-oh!\xe2\x80\x9d and went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cLeave me alone\r\n... I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it! I have to! Ba-oh! Ba-oh! Ba-oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stag was now standing in the little clearing and looking languidly\r\nin the grass for something tasty to eat.\r\n\r\nAs he looked alternately at Faline as she panicked and at the calm and\r\nrelaxed stag, something rose up in Bambi. The words of comfort he had\r\noffered to Faline had also helped him to overcome his own alarm at the\r\nsight of the stag. Now he scolded himself for falling into a pitiful\r\nstate every time he saw the stag; a state where horror, excitement,\r\nadmiration and inferiority were all mixed together and made him\r\nsuffer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d he decided with much effort, \xe2\x80\x9cnow I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\r\ngo right up to him and introduce myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t do that!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Faline, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t do that! Ba-oh! Something\r\nterrible will happen, ba-oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to do it whatever happens,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi retorted. The stag, so\r\nrelaxed as he picked out all the best things to eat, paid no attention\r\nat all to Faline as she screamed. It seemed to Bambi that he was far\r\ntoo haughty. He felt injured and humiliated. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going out there,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cJust calm down! Nothing\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see. You wait\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe actually did go out there. But Faline did not wait. She did not\r\nwant to wait, not in the slightest, and nor did she have the courage\r\nto do so. She swung round and ran away and could still be heard as she\r\ngot further and further away: \xe2\x80\x9cBa-oh! Ba-oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi would have liked to go after her, but that was no longer really\r\npossible. He pulled himself together and went forward.\r\n\r\nThrough the twigs and branches he could see the stag standing in the\r\nclearing, his head lowered to the ground.\r\n\r\nBambi felt his heart thumping as he went out there.\r\n\r\nThe stag immediately raised his head high and looked over at\r\nhim. Then, as if confused, he looked straight ahead.\r\n\r\nBambi saw both these movements as very haughty, the way the stag had\r\nlooked at him and the way he was now occupied with looking straight\r\nahead as if there were nobody there.\r\n\r\nBambi did not know what he should do. He had come out here with the\r\nfirm intention of speaking to the stag. Good morning, he would have\r\nsaid, my name is Bambi ... may I ask what your name is, sir?\r\n\r\nCertainly! He had imagined this as flowing very smoothly, and now it\r\nturned out not to be as simple as he had thought. What was the use,\r\nhere, of having the best intentions? Bambi did not want to seem to be\r\nbadly brought up, but that is how he would seem if he came out here\r\nwithout saying a word. Nor did he want to impose himself on the stag,\r\nbut that was what he would be doing if he started speaking.\r\n\r\nThe stag stood there in indignant majesty. Bambi was alarmed and felt\r\nhumiliated. He tried in vain to shake himself into doing something and\r\njust one thought kept running through his head: Why should I let him\r\nfrighten me ...? I\xe2\x80\x99m just as good as he is ... just as good as he is!\r\n\r\nIt did not help. Bambi continued to feel frightened and felt deep in\r\nthe heart of him that he was not just as good as he is. Not by a long\r\nway. He felt pitiful, and he needed all his strength to keep any kind\r\nof dignity.\r\n\r\nThe stag looked at him and thought: He is charming ... truly\r\ndelightful ... so good looking ... so elegant ... so fine in all his\r\nmovements. But I\xe2\x80\x99d better not stare at him like this. That would\r\nreally not be proper. And I might even embarrass him.\r\n\r\nAnd he looked away from Bambi and went back to gazing into the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThat haughty look, Bambi decided! It\xe2\x80\x99s unbearable, the way he puffs\r\nhimself up!\r\n\r\nThe stag thought: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to talk with him ... he seems so likeable\r\n... it\xe2\x80\x99s so stupid, the way that people never talk to each other! And\r\nhe continued to occupy himself with gazing thoughtfully into the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m just like the air for him, said Bambi, people like that always act\r\nas if they were the only people in the world!\r\n\r\nBut what should I say to him ...? the stag wondered. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had\r\nany practice in this ... I\xe2\x80\x99d say something ridiculous and make a fool\r\nof myself ... as I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99s very clever.\r\n\r\nBambi pulled himself together and looked hard at the stag. He\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\nmajestic! he thought, still unsure of himself.\r\n\r\nWell ... perhaps another time ... the stag finally concluded, and he\r\nwalked away, unsatisfied but majestic.\r\n\r\nBambi, embittered, stayed where he was.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15\r\n\r\nThe forest was steaming under the burning sun. Ever since it had risen\r\nit had been drinking all the clouds out of the sky, even the tiniest\r\nwisps, and now it reigned alone in the expanse of blue, made pale by\r\nthe heat. Over the meadows and the treetops the air shimmered in\r\nglassy, transparent waves like it does above a flame. Not a leaf\r\nmoved, not a blade of grass. The birds remained silent, they sat\r\nhidden in the shade of the leaves and did not move from the spot. All\r\nthe paths and lanes through the clearings were empty, as no animal was\r\nmoving anywhere. The forest lay motionless in the dazzling light, as\r\nif in flame. The earth breathed, the trees, the bushes and the animals\r\nbreathed in the weighty luxury of this heat. Bambi slept.\r\n\r\nHe had spent a happy night and into the light of morning romping with\r\nFaline, it was such bliss that he even forgot to eat. But that was\r\nbecause he had tired himself out so much that he did not even feel any\r\nhunger. His eyes fell shut. He had just gone into the middle of the\r\nundergrowth where he stopped, laid himself down and fell straight to\r\nsleep. The junipers, inflamed by the sun, threw out a bitter-sharp\r\nsmell, the fine aroma from the young dampness rose into his head and\r\nexhilarated him as he slept and gave him new strength.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he woke up and felt confused.\r\n\r\nWas that not Faline calling out?\r\n\r\nBambi looked around. In his memory he could still see her as she stood\r\nhere close by the hawthorns and picking off the leaves while he lay\r\ndown. He had thought she would stay there beside him. But now she was\r\ngone, she had probably become tired of being alone and was now calling\r\nfor him to come and find her.\r\n\r\nAs Bambi listened he wondered how long he could have been asleep and\r\nhow many times Faline could have called. He could not work it out. His\r\nhead was still dull behind the veil of sleep.\r\n\r\nThen the call came again. Bambi swung round suddenly to face the\r\ndirection the sound came from. There it was again! And he was suddenly\r\ncheerful. He felt wonderfully refreshed, felt he had rested long\r\nenough, felt strengthened, and he felt immensely hungry.\r\n\r\nHe heard the call again, loud and clear, as fine as gentle birdsong,\r\nyearning and tender, \xe2\x80\x9cCome ... come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, that was her voice! That was Faline! Bambi rushed from where he\r\nwas with such urgency that the thin twigs on the bushes broke and\r\ntheir hot, green leaves merely rustled.\r\n\r\nBut while he was jumping he had to stop and throw himself to one side.\r\nThere stood the elder, blocking his way.\r\n\r\nThe only thing seething in Bambi was his love. He did not care about\r\nthe elder any more. He would certainly come across him again\r\nsometime. But now he had no time for old gentlemen, however venerable\r\nthey might be. All he could think of now was Faline.\r\n\r\nHe made a perfunctory greeting, and wanted to get quickly past him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d the elder asked, seriously.\r\n\r\nBambi was slightly ashamed, wondered how he could talk his way out of\r\nit, but then he regained his senses and answered honestly, \xe2\x80\x9cTo her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder.\r\n\r\nFor a second, a spark of anger rose up in Bambi, just one. Not go to\r\nFaline? How could the elder expect that of him. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just run away,\r\nthought Bambi. And he quickly looked at the elder. But the depth of\r\nthe gaze directed at him from the elder\xe2\x80\x99s dark eyes held him where he\r\nwas. He shook with impatience, but he did not run away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s calling for me ...\xe2\x80\x9d he said, by way of explanation. He said it\r\nin a way that was clearly pleading. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t get in my way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder, \xe2\x80\x9cshe is not calling for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sound came again, loud and clear like birdsong, \xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgain now!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Bambi as he became more cross, \xe2\x80\x9cListen to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m listening,\xe2\x80\x9d the elder nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodbye then ...,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi threw at him curtly.\r\n\r\nBut the elder commanded him, \xe2\x80\x9cStay here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it you want then?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Bambi, out of control. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me go!\r\nI haven\xe2\x80\x99t got time for this! Please ... if Faline is calling for me\r\n... you must be able to see ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m telling you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is not Faline.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi was puzzled. \xe2\x80\x9cBut ... I recognize her voice, I can hear her\r\nquite clearly ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to me,\xe2\x80\x9d the elder continued.\r\n\r\nThe call came again.\r\n\r\nThe ground was burning under Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s feet. \xe2\x80\x9cLater! I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nimplored.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou would not come back. Not ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe call came yet again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got to! I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to ...\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi was beginning entirely to lose\r\ncontrol of himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlright then,\xe2\x80\x9d the elder explained, still in command, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the two of\r\nus will go there together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuickly!\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi declared and ran ahead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo ... go slowly!\xe2\x80\x9d the elder now commanded in a voice that left Bambi\r\nwith no choice but to obey. \xe2\x80\x9cYou stay behind me ... step by step ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe elder began to move forward. Bambi followed behind him, impatient\r\nand sighing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder without stopping, \xe2\x80\x9chowever many times you\r\nhear that call do not move from my side. If it is Faline then we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfind her soon enough. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not Faline. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let it tear you away\r\nfrom me. It all depends on whether you trust me or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi did not dare to contradict him and remained silent.\r\n\r\nThe elder walked slowly forward and Bambi followed. Oh, how skilled\r\nthe elder was in knowing how to walk! No sound came from under his\r\nhooves. Not a leave moved. No twig cracked. In this way the elder\r\ncrept through the dense undergrowth, slid his way through the tangle\r\nof ancient bushes. Bambi could only be amazed, he had to admire the\r\nelder despite his feverish impatience. He had never realized it was\r\npossible to go forward in this way.\r\n\r\nThe call came again and again.\r\n\r\nThe elder stopped, listened and nodded his head.\r\n\r\nBambi stood near him, shaken with yearning, tortured by what he had to\r\ndo, and understood nothing.\r\n\r\nThe elder stopped several times without the call having been heard, he\r\nwould throw his head up high, listen, and nod. Bambi heard\r\nnothing. The elder turned away from the direction the call was coming\r\nfrom, he was going to approach it in a curve. This made Bambi very\r\nangry.\r\n\r\nThe call came over and again.\r\n\r\nAt last they were getting nearer, nearer still, and then very near.\r\n\r\nThe elder whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever you see now ... don\xe2\x80\x99t move ... do you\r\nhear? Pay attention to everything I do and you do exactly the same\r\n... Be careful! And don\xe2\x80\x99t panic ...!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few steps further on ... there came suddenly that sharp, stimulating\r\nsmell that Bambi knew so well, strong in his nose. It was so strong\r\nthat he nearly cried out. He stood there as if nailed to the\r\nground. His heart suddenly began to beat so hard he could feel it in\r\nhis throat.\r\n\r\nThe elder stood relaxed next to him. He showed the direction with his\r\neyes: There!\r\n\r\nBut there stood He!\r\n\r\nHe stood quite close nearby, pressed against the trunk of an oak tree,\r\ncovered in hazel bushes, and the gentle call could be heard: \xe2\x80\x9cCome ...\r\ncome ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll that could be seen was His back, His face was very unclear, and\r\ncould only be seen at all when He turned His head slightly to one\r\nside.\r\n\r\nBambi was so completely confused, so shocked that he only slowly came\r\nto understand: He was standing there, it was Him who had been\r\nimitating Faline\xe2\x80\x99s voice. It was Him who had been whistling, \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\n... come ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA pale horror ran through all of Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s limbs. The thought of flight\r\ncame up from his heart and pulled at him, tugged at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep still!\xe2\x80\x9d the elder promptly commanded in a whisper, as if he\r\nwanted to pre-empt an outbreak of panic. And Bambi, with some effort,\r\nkept control of himself.\r\n\r\nThe elder looked at him; it seemed to Bambi at first, despite where he\r\nwas, that the elder was gently mocking him. But then, straight\r\nafterwards, he seemed once more to be fully serious and benevolent.\r\n\r\nBambi blinked as he looked over to where He stood, and felt that he\r\nwould no longer be able to stand being near something as horrifying as\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nThe elder seemed to understand what Bambi was thinking and whispered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go ...,\xe2\x80\x9d as he turned round and left.\r\n\r\nThey crept carefully away, the elder moving in strange zig-zags,\r\nthough Bambi could not understand why. Even now he found it hard to\r\ncontain his impatience as he followed these slow steps. It had been\r\nhis yearning for Faline that had driven him along the path to this\r\nplace, but now the urge to flee was chasing through his veins.\r\n\r\nThe elder, though, continued in his slow walk, then stopped, listened,\r\nwent on, still on a zig-zag route, stopped again, went on again,\r\nslowly, very slowly.\r\n\r\nThey must, by now, have been well away from that place of terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe keeps on stopping, so I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99ll be alright to start speaking\r\nagain, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll say thank-you to him.\xe2\x80\x9d He could see the elder\r\njust in front of him as he disappeared into a dense tangle of dogwood\r\nbushes. Not a leaf moved, not a twig cracked as the elder crept into\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBambi followed him and tried very hard to pass through just as\r\nsilently, just as artfully to avoid making any sound. But he did not\r\nhave that luck. The leaves rustled gently, branches bent under the\r\npressure of his flank, flicked back again with a loud rattling, dry\r\ntwigs broke with a quick, loud crack against his breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe saved my life,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi continued to ponder. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat should I say to\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the elder could no longer be seen. Bambi stepped very slowly out\r\nof the bushes, saw a wild tangle of goldenrods in front of him, raised\r\nhis head and looked around. There was not a blade of grass moving for\r\nas far as he could see. He was alone.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing, now, to tell him what to do, and the urge to flee\r\nquickly took hold of him. As he rushed through them, the goldenrods\r\nwere divided with a broad hiss, as if being cut down with a scythe.\r\n\r\nIt was a long time wandering lost in the forest before he found\r\nFaline. He was breathless, he was tired, he was happy and deeply\r\nmoved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cplease ... don\xe2\x80\x99t call to me when we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\napart ... never call to me again ...! We can look for each other until\r\nwe find one another ... but please, don\xe2\x80\x99t call to me as ... your voice\r\nis something I can\xe2\x80\x99t resist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 16\r\n\r\nA couple of days later, with nothing to worry about, they made their\r\nway together through the thicket of oaks that lay on the other side of\r\nthe meadow. They were about to go across the meadow and there, where\r\nthe lofty oak tree stood, they would be back on their usual paths. The\r\nbushes ahead of them became lighter, and there they stopped and peered\r\nout. There, by the oak, there was something red moving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho could that be ...?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Bambi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect it\xe2\x80\x99s Ronno or Karus,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Faline.\r\n\r\nBambi doubted this. \xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t dare to come near me any more.\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi\r\nlooked more carefully. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he decided, \xe2\x80\x9cthat isn\xe2\x80\x99t Karus or Ronno\r\n... that\xe2\x80\x99s a stranger ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFaline agreed, astonished and very curious. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re right, a stranger,\r\nI can see that too now ... odd!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey watched.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seems very careless!\xe2\x80\x9d called Faline.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStupid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi, \xe2\x80\x9che is really stupid. He\xe2\x80\x99s behaving like a\r\nlittle child ... as if there weren\xe2\x80\x99t any danger at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go over there,\xe2\x80\x9d suggest Faline. She was too curious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlright then,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi answered, \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s go ... I want to get a closer\r\nlook at this lad ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey made a few steps but then Faline hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cBut ... what if he\r\nwants to fight you ... he\xe2\x80\x99s strong ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah!\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi lowered his head to one side and had a disdainful look.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook how small his crown is ... why should I be frightened of that?\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s big and fat ... but strong? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. Just come with me\r\n...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went. Across the meadow the other deer was busy biting at grass,\r\nand did not notice them until they had come quite a long way out onto\r\nthe meadow. He immediately ran out to meet them. He made joyful,\r\nplayful jumps and again seemed to be very childlike. Bambi and Faline\r\nwere puzzled and waited for him. Now he was just a few steps\r\naway. Like them, he stood still.\r\n\r\nAfter a little while he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you recognize me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi had lowered his head, ready for combat. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you ... know us?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\nThe stranger interrupted him. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Bambi!\xe2\x80\x9d he called, full of\r\nadmonishment but trusting.\r\n\r\nBambi became hesitant when he heard his name being used. The sound of\r\nthis voice tugged at some kind of memory in his heart, but Faline made\r\nno delay and jumped forward to meet the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGobo!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed and the she was silent. She stood there without\r\na word, without moving. She had lost her breath completely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaline ...\xe2\x80\x9d said Gobo gently, \xe2\x80\x9cFaline ... sister ... you recognize me\r\n...\xe2\x80\x9d He went to her and kissed her on the mouth. Suddenly the tears\r\nbegan to flow down his cheeks.\r\n\r\nFaline cried too, and she was unable to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut ... Gobo ...\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi began. His voice quivered and he was very\r\nexcited, he was deeply touched and astonished beyond measure. \xe2\x80\x9cGobo\r\n... aren\xe2\x80\x99t you dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGobo laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can see, can\xe2\x80\x99t you. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s easy enough to see\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut ... that time ... in the snow?\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi persisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat time?\xe2\x80\x9d Gobo lowered his head bashfully. \xe2\x80\x9cThat time it was Him\r\nwho saved me ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where have you been all this time ...?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Faline now, in\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\nGobo answered, \xe2\x80\x9cWith Him ... I\xe2\x80\x99ve been with Him all this time ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe became silent, looked at Faline and Bambi and greatly enjoyed the\r\nsight of their helpless astonishment. Then he added, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear\r\nfriends ... I have had many new experiences ... more than all of you\r\nput together here in this forest of yours ...\xe2\x80\x9d It sounded a little\r\nboastful, but they still did not notice that, they were too taken up\r\nwith the enormity of their surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell us about them!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Faline, unable to control herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gobo complacently, \xe2\x80\x9cI could tell you about them all day\r\nlong and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have told you everything.\r\n\r\nBambi insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on then, tell us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGobo went over to Faline and became serious. \xe2\x80\x9cIs mother still alive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe asked timidly and quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d Faline cheerfully declared. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s alive ... I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen her\r\nfor a long time though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to go and see her, straight away!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gobo. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you coming\r\nwith me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd off they went.\r\n\r\nAll along the way they were silent. Bambi and Faline could feel Gobo\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimpatient yearning to see his mother, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why neither of them\r\nsaid anything. Gobo strode hurriedly forward and said nothing. They\r\ndid nothing to stop him.\r\n\r\nExcept that now and then, when he blindly ran through a place where\r\nthe paths crossed, always running straight ahead, or when in sudden\r\nhaste he rushed into another direction they would quietly call to\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cThis way!\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi would whisper. Or Faline would say, \xe2\x80\x9cNo ... it\r\ngoes round here now ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA couple times they had to go across broad clearings. They noticed\r\nthat Gobo never stopped at the edge of the trees, never even glanced\r\naround to see that it was safe before he went out into the open. He\r\nwould simply run out there with no caution at all. Bambi and Faline\r\nlooked at each other in amazement whenever that happened, but they\r\nsaid nothing and hesitantly followed Gobo.\r\n\r\nThey had to wander about in this way, searching and going up and down,\r\nfor a long time.\r\n\r\nGobo suddenly recognized the paths he had used in his childhood. He\r\nlooked at them in wonder, and it did not occur to him that Bambi and\r\nFaline had led him to them. He looked round at them and declared,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of that? Look how good I was at finding my way\r\nhere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey said nothing. They merely, once more, looked at each other.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards they came to a small chamber in the foliage.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere!\xe2\x80\x9d called Faline as she slipped into it. Gobo followed her and\r\nthen stopped. It was the chamber where they both had been born, where\r\nthey had lived as little children with their mother. Gobo and Faline\r\nlooked close into each other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. They said not a word. Faline\r\nkissed her brother gently on his lips. Then they hurried on.\r\n\r\nThey probably spent another hour going up and down. The sun shone more\r\nand more brightly through the twigs, the forest became more and more\r\nquiet. It was time to lie down and rest. Gobo, though, did not feel\r\ntired. He hurried forward, breathed heavily because of his impatient\r\nexcitement and looked around without any plan. He flinched when a\r\nweasel rushed out from the long grass and passed under him. He nearly\r\nstepped on the pheasants who were pressed close down to the ground,\r\nand when they flew up in front of him with loud flapping of wing and\r\ntold him off he was very alarmed. Bambi was amazed at how unfamiliar\r\nhe seemed with everything and how he proceeded as if blind.\r\n\r\nGobo stopped and turned to the two of them. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t find her!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed in bewilderment. Faline soothed him. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will do soon,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid with emotion. \xe2\x80\x9cNot long now, Gobo.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at him. He was\r\nonce again wearing that disheartened expression that she knew so well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould we call for her?\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a grin. \xe2\x80\x9cShould we start\r\ncalling again ... like we used to, when we were still children?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi continued walking. Just a few steps. And then he caught a\r\nglimpse of Auntie Ena. She had already lain down to rest and lay\r\nwithout moving in the shadow of a hazel bush, very near.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. At that moment Gobo and Faline arrived.\r\nAll three of them stood beside each other and looked over at Ena. She\r\nhad quietly raised her head and looked sleepily at them.\r\n\r\nGobo made a few hesitant steps forward and gently called, \xe2\x80\x9cMother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs if snatched up by a thunderbolt, Ena was no longer lying down but\r\nup on her feet and standing as if cemented into position. Gobo quickly\r\njumped to her. \xe2\x80\x9cMother ...\xe2\x80\x9d he began again. He wanted to speak but\r\ncould not utter a word.\r\n\r\nHis mother looked closely into his eyes. She began to stand with less\r\nstiffness; she was shaking so much that wave after wave ran over her\r\nback and shoulders.\r\n\r\nShe asked no questions, she did not ask for an explanation, not for\r\nany account of what had happened. Slowly, she kissed Gobo on his lips,\r\nkissed his cheeks, his neck; without cease, she washed him with her\r\nkisses, just as she had done when she had given birth to him.\r\n\r\nBambi and Faline had left.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 17\r\n\r\nThey stood together in the middle of a thicket in a small clearing,\r\nand Gobo told them about where he had been.\r\n\r\nTheir friend the hare sat there too, raised his ears in amazement as\r\nhe listened tensely and let them sink again in his awe at what he\r\nheard, only to raise them again immediately after.\r\n\r\nThe magpie squatted on the lowest twig of a young beech tree and\r\nlistened in astonishment. The jay sat uneasily nearby on an ash tree,\r\nsometimes screeching in his amazement.\r\n\r\nA pair of pheasants they knew had found their way there with their\r\nwives and children. They craned their necks in wonderment as they\r\nlistened, drew them back in, turned their heads here and there and\r\nremained speechless.\r\n\r\nThe squirrel bounded in and moved in a way that showed he was very\r\nexcited. He soon slipped down the ground, ran up one or other tree,\r\nthen leant back on his erected tail and showed his white breast. He\r\ncontinually wanted to interrupt Gobo, wanted to say something, but\r\neach time all those around him ordered him to be quiet.\r\n\r\nHe told them about how he had lain helpless in the snow and waited for\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the dogs who found me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthose dogs are terrifying.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely the most terrifying things in the whole wide world.\r\nTheir throats are full of blood, their voices are full of anger and\r\nwithout mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked round at everyone there and went on. .\xe2\x80\x9d..\r\nbut, well ... afterwards I played with them as if we were all equal\r\n...\xe2\x80\x9d He was very proud of himself. .\xe2\x80\x9d.. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be scared of\r\nthem any more because now we\xe2\x80\x99re all good friends. Still though, when\r\nthey start to get angry there\xe2\x80\x99s a thumping in my head, and my heart\r\ngets quite stiff. But they don\xe2\x80\x99t always mean it in such a nasty way\r\nand, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve just said, I\xe2\x80\x99m their friend now ... but there\xe2\x80\x99s so much\r\npower in their voices it\xe2\x80\x99s horrible.\xe2\x80\x9d He became silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on then!\xe2\x80\x9d Faline insisted.\r\n\r\nGobo looked at her. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, back then they would have torn me limb from\r\nlimb ... but then He came along!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGobo paused. The others could scarcely breathe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gobo. \xe2\x80\x9cThen He came along! He called the dogs off and they\r\nimmediately became quite quiet. He called to them again and they lay\r\nmotionless on the ground in front of Him. Then he lifted me up. I\r\nscreamed. But he stroked me. He held me gently pressed onto his\r\nchest. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt me. And then He carried me off ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFaline interrupted him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, \xe2\x80\x98carried you\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGobo began to explain, in detail and with some self-importance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very easy,\xe2\x80\x9d interjected Bambi. \xe2\x80\x9cThink of the squirrel, Faline,\r\nwhat he does when he\xe2\x80\x99s holding a nut and carries it away ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow the squirrel wanted a chance to speak at last. .\xe2\x80\x9d.. A cousin of\r\nmine ...\xe2\x80\x9d he began with enthusiasm. But the others immediately\r\ninsisted, \xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet! Be quiet! Let Gobo carry on speaking!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe squirrel had to say silent. He was cowed and bewildered, pressed\r\nhis forepaws against his white breast and turned to the magpie to\r\nspeak just to him. .\xe2\x80\x9d.. I was saying ... a cousin of mine ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the magpie simply turned his back on him.\r\n\r\nGobo told them of marvellous things. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s cold outside, and the storm\r\nis howling. But indoors, with him, there\xe2\x80\x99s no wind and it\xe2\x80\x99s as warm as\r\nin summer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHach!\xe2\x80\x9d screeched the jay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOutside, the rain is lashing down from the sky so that everything is\r\nin water. But indoors, with Him, there\xe2\x80\x99s not a drop of rain and you\r\nstay dry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe pheasants twitched their necks up high and turned their heads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen everywhere outside was deep in snow, I was inside and nice and\r\nwarm, I was even quite hot, and He gave me hay to eat, chestnuts,\r\npotatoes, turnips, everything I could have wished for ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHay?!\xe2\x80\x9d they all asked in one voice, astonished, incredulous, excited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFresh, sweet hay,\xe2\x80\x9d Gobo repeated calmly, and looked triumphantly\r\nround at them.\r\n\r\nThe squirrel tried to squeeze in his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cA cousin of mine ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust be quiet!\xe2\x80\x9d the others ordered.\r\n\r\nAnd Faline asked Gobo vigorously, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere did He get hay from, and all\r\nthose other things, in the winter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe grows it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Gobo. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever he wants, he grows it, and\r\nwhen he wants it it\xe2\x80\x99s there for him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFaline continued asking questions. \xe2\x80\x9cWeren\xe2\x80\x99t you afraid, Gobo, all the\r\ntime you were with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGobo thought himself very clever and grinned. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Faline, I\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t afraid, not any more. After all, I knew He didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to do\r\nanything to hurt me. Why should I have been afraid? You all think He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvery nasty, but He\xe2\x80\x99s not nasty. When He likes anyone, when anyone does\r\nsomething for Him, He\xe2\x80\x99s nice. Lovely and nice. There\xe2\x80\x99s no-one in the\r\nwhole wide world who could be as nice as He is ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as Gobo was speaking in this way, an elder emerged silently\r\nfrom the bushes.\r\n\r\nGobo did not notice him and continued speaking, but all the others had\r\nseen the elder and held their breath in awe of him.\r\n\r\nThe elder stood there without moving and watched Gobo with deep and\r\nserious eyes.\r\n\r\nGobo said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just Him, it was His children, they loved me\r\ntoo, and His wife and everyone. They stroked me, gave me food and\r\nplayed with me ...\xe2\x80\x9d He broke off. He had seen the elder.\r\n\r\nEveryone became silent.\r\n\r\nThen the elder, in his calm and authoritative voice, asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthat stripe on your neck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEveryone looked at him and became aware, for the first time, of the\r\ndark stripe made up of compressed and eroded hair that went round\r\nGobo\xe2\x80\x99s neck.\r\n\r\nGobo answered the elder uncertainly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat ...? That\xe2\x80\x99s from the collar\r\nI wore ... it\xe2\x80\x99s His collar ... and ... yes, and ... and it\xe2\x80\x99s a great\r\nhonour to wear his collar ... it\xe2\x80\x99s ...\xe2\x80\x9d He became confused and\r\nstammered.\r\n\r\nAll were silent. The elder kept a sad and piercing look on Gobo for a\r\nlong time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou poor thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gently, then he turned round and was gone.\r\n\r\nIn the silence that followed from this disturbance the squirrel\r\nstarted to chatter. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see ... a cousin of mine was there with Him\r\ntoo ... He\xe2\x80\x99d caught him and locked him in ... oh, for a very long\r\ntime, till one day my cousin ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut no-one was listening to the squirrel.\r\n\r\nThey all went away.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 18\r\n\r\nOne day, Marena turned up again.\r\n\r\nShe was already nearly grown up when Gobo disappeared, but she was\r\nalmost never to be seen since then. She held herself apart and went on\r\nher own solitary ways.\r\n\r\nShe had always had a slight build and looked quite young. But she was\r\nserious and quiet and was more gentle than anyone else. Now she had\r\nheard from the squirrel, from jays and magpies, from thrush and\r\npheasant that Gobo had come back home and had had wonderful\r\nexperiences. There she appeared, and wanted to see him. Gobo\xe2\x80\x99s mother\r\nwas very proud and happy about her visit. Most of all, Gobo\xe2\x80\x99s mother\r\nwas very proud of how happy she seemed. She was glad that the entire\r\nforest was talking about her son, she wallowed in his fame and she\r\nwanted everyone to acknowledge that Gobo was the cleverest, the most\r\ncapable and the best.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think, Marena?\xe2\x80\x9d she called. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of Gobo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe did not wait for an answer but just continued. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you still\r\nremember that time when Mrs. Nettla said he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t amount to much\r\nbecause he shivered a bit in the cold ... and can you remember how she\r\nprophesied I\xe2\x80\x99d never get much joy from him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGobo certainly gave you enough to worry about,\xe2\x80\x9d Marena answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all in the past!\xe2\x80\x9d Gobo\xe2\x80\x99s mother declared, and was very\r\nsurprised that anyone could still be thinking of these things. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\r\nfeel so sorry about poor Mrs. Nettla. It\xe2\x80\x99s such a shame that she\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nlonger alive and can\xe2\x80\x99t see what my Gobo has made of himself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, poor Mrs. Nettla,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marena gently, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a pity about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGobo enjoyed hearing his mother praise him like this. It pleased\r\nhim. He stood there and felt as good as if standing in warm sunshine\r\nwhen he heard these praises.\r\n\r\nHis mother said to Marena, \xe2\x80\x9cEven the old prince came to see Gobo ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe said it in a way that was secretive, in a whisper and celebratory.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s never let any of us catch a glimpse of him ... but when it was\r\nGobo, he came!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did he call me a poor thing?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gobo, sounding very\r\ndiscontented. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to know what that was supposed to mean!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you worry about that,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother reassured him, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s very old\r\nand ... a bit odd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut now, finally, said what was on his mind. \xe2\x80\x9cAll this time it\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\ngoing round my head what he meant by that. You poor thing. I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\npoor, I\xe2\x80\x99m not unlucky! I\xe2\x80\x99m very lucky! I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen more, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had more\r\nexperiences than anyone else! I know more about the world and about\r\nlife than anyone here in the forest! What do you think, Marena?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s certainly no-one who can gainsay that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom that day on, Marena and Gobo were always together.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 19\r\n\r\nBambi looked for the elder. He would walk around all through the\r\nnights, wandered about at the time the sun rose and when the morning\r\nsky was red, all along uncharted ways, without Faline.\r\n\r\nThere were times when he still felt an urge to go to her, sometimes he\r\nwas still as happy to be with her as he had been before, he found it\r\nbeautiful to walk about with her, to hear her chatting, to have a meal\r\nwith her at the edge of a thicket; but now these were things that did\r\nnot satisfy him as much as they had done.\r\n\r\nBefore, it was rare for him to think of the elder when he was with\r\nFaline, and even then it was only fleetingly. Now he was out searching\r\nfor the elder, he felt an inexplicable yearning to see him and\r\nremembered about Faline only once. He could always find her whenever\r\nhe wanted her. He felt little urge to be together with the others\r\nthough, Gobo or Auntie Ena. He avoided them whenever he could.\r\n\r\nBambi was unable to stop thinking about the phrase that the elder had\r\nused about Gobo. He had been remarkably struck by it. From the first\r\nday that he had come back Gobo\xe2\x80\x99s reappearance had seriously disturbed\r\nhim. Bambi did not know why, but when Gobo looked at him it\r\nimmediately seemed to make him suffer. Bambi was ashamed of Gobo but\r\ndid not know why; he was worried about him without knowing why. But\r\nnow, whenever he was with the incautious, self conscious, complacent\r\nand haughty Gobo, that phrase came to his mind: You poor thing! He\r\ncould not get it out of his head.\r\n\r\nBut one dark night, in which Bambi had once again assured the owlet,\r\njust to please him, that he had been dreadfully startled by him, it\r\nsuddenly occurred to Bambi to ask where the elder might be.\r\n\r\nThe owlet replied, in his cooing voice, that he did not have the\r\nslightest idea. But Bambi could see that he did not really want to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you. You\xe2\x80\x99re so clever, you know about\r\neverything that goes on in the forest. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you know where the\r\nelder is hiding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe owlet went back down into a nice, soft, grey-brown ball, turned\r\nhis big, clever, eyes a little, as he always did when he felt like it\r\nand asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWell then, do you really have such respect for me? Why\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthat then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi did not hesitate. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause you\xe2\x80\x99re so wise,\xe2\x80\x9d he said candidly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand despite that, you\xe2\x80\x99re such fun and so friendly. And because you\r\ncan frighten others so well. That\xe2\x80\x99s so clever to startle others, so\r\nvery clever. I wish I could do that, that would be very useful for\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe owlet had sunk his beak deep into his breast feathers and was\r\npleased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI know that the elder likes your company ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Bambi as the owlet spoke, and his heart\r\nbegan to beat with joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the owlet, \xe2\x80\x9che likes your company, and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s why I think I might dare to tell you where he is now ...\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\npulled his feathers down against his body and suddenly looked quite\r\nthin again. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know that deep gorge where the willows are?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know the thicket of oak trees on the other side?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi admitted, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never been on the other side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow listen carefully,\xe2\x80\x9d the owlet whispered, on the other side there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na thicket of oak trees. You have to go through there and you come to\r\nan area of bushes, hazel and white poplars, hawthorns and privet. In\r\nthe middle, there, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to find an old beech tree that\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nbroken down by the wind. It won\xe2\x80\x99t be as easy for you to find down\r\nthere on the ground, certainly not as easy as it is from up in the\r\nair. That\xe2\x80\x99s where the elder lives. Under the trunk of that tree. But\r\n... don\xe2\x80\x99t say I told you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder the trunk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d the owlet laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a dip in the ground there. The\r\nhollow trunk lies over it. That\xe2\x80\x99s where he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi with enthusiasm. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nable to find him, but thank you a thousand times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hurried away.\r\n\r\nMaking no sound, the owlet flew along behind him and close above him\r\nhe began to screech. \xe2\x80\x9cU-y? Uiy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi was startled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I shock you?\xe2\x80\x9d the owlet asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes ...,\xe2\x80\x9d he stuttered and this time he was telling the truth.\r\n\r\nThe owlet felt satisfied with himself and cooed, \xe2\x80\x9cI just wanted to\r\nremind you \xe2\x80\x93 don\xe2\x80\x99t say I told you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi assured him and he ran off. When he reached\r\nthe gorge the elder emerged from the darkness of chamber right in\r\nfront of him, so silently and so suddenly that Bambi was greatly\r\nstartled once again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not there any more, where you hope to find me,\xe2\x80\x9d the elder said.\r\n\r\nBambi said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want from me?\xe2\x80\x9d the elder asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing ...\xe2\x80\x9d stuttered Bambi, \xe2\x80\x9coh ... nothing ... do forgive me...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a pause the elder said gently, \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just today that you\r\nstarted looking for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited. Bambi said nothing. The elder continued, \xe2\x80\x9cyou passed quite\r\nclose to me twice yesterday, and twice this morning too, very\r\nclose...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy ...\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi gathered up his courage, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy did you say that about\r\nGobo ...?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I was mistaken?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi declared with a passion, \xe2\x80\x9cno! I think you must be right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe elder nodded very slightly, and his eyes looked at Bambi with more\r\nbenevolence than ever before.\r\n\r\nBambi said to these eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cBut ... why? ... I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s enough that you think so. You\xe2\x80\x99ll understand it later.\r\nFarewell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 20\r\n\r\nIt was not long before everyone noticed that Gobo had an odd and\r\npuzzling habit. He slept at night, when all the others were awake and\r\nmoving about. But by day, when all the others sought out a place to\r\nhide and sleep, he would cheerfully walk off somewhere. And when he\r\nfelt like it he would go, without hesitation, out of the thick woods\r\nand stand in full daylight in the middle of the meadow with no worry\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nBambi was no longer able to keep quiet about this. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you not think\r\nof the danger?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d came Gobo\xe2\x80\x99s simple answer. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no danger for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBambi, love,\xe2\x80\x9d Gobo\xe2\x80\x99s mother put in, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re forgetting that He is a\r\nfriend of his. Gobo can afford to allow himself more than you can or\r\nanyone else.\xe2\x80\x9d And she was very proud of this. Bambi said no more. One\r\nday, Gobo commented to him, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know? Sometimes it strikes me as\r\nodd that I can eat here like this, whenever I want to and wherever I\r\nwant to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi did not understand. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s so odd about that? That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\r\nall do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGobo thought about this and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes ... well that\xe2\x80\x99s you! Bit with\r\nme it\xe2\x80\x99s a bit different. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got used to having my food brought to\r\nme, and that they\xe2\x80\x99ll call me when it\xe2\x80\x99s ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi looked at Gobo with pity. Looked at Auntie Ena, at Faline and\r\nMarena. But they just smiled and admired Gobo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d Faline began, \xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99ll find it hard to get used to\r\nthe winter, Gobo. For us, outside in the winter there is no hay at\r\nall, no turnips, no potatoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Gobo thoughtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cbut if it gets too hard\r\nfor me I\xe2\x80\x99ll just go back to Him. Why should I go hungry? I really\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t need to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout a word, Bambi turned round and walked away.\r\n\r\nGobo now was alone with Marena, and he began to talk about Bambi. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBambi is good, but he thinks I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nstill just stupid, little Gobo, like I used to be. He still can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been changed into something special. The danger!\r\nWhy is he always on about danger? I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he means the best for\r\nme. But danger is something for him and for those like him, not for\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarena agreed with him. She loved him, and Gobo loved her, and the two\r\nof them were very happy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cno-one understands me as well as you do!\r\nAnyway, I can\xe2\x80\x99t complain. Everyone respects and honours me, but it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyou who understands me best. The others ... I\xe2\x80\x99ve told them so many\r\ntimes how good He is but they won\xe2\x80\x99t listen to me. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink I\xe2\x80\x99m lying but they keep on thinking he must be terrible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always believed in Him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marena with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d Gobo replied glibly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you remember,\xe2\x80\x9d Marena went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat day when you stayed lying\r\nin the snow? I said that one day He would come to us here in the woods\r\nand play with us ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Gobo, speaking very slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t remember that at\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA couple of weeks went by, and one morning, just as the sun was\r\nrising, Bambi and Faline, Gobo and Mareni, were all together in the\r\nold thicket of hazel bushes that they saw as home. Bambi and Faline\r\nhad just come back home from their wanderings, they had gone past the\r\noak and wanted to seek out their place to rest when they came across\r\nGobo and Marena. Gobo was just about to go out onto the meadow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay here with us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll soon be broad daylight, no-one\r\ngoes out into the open at this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRidiculous,\xe2\x80\x9d Gobo mocked. \xe2\x80\x9cIf no-one goes ... I go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe strode away, Marena followed him.\r\n\r\nBambi and Faline stayed where they were. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi angrily\r\nto Faline. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on! He can just do what he wants.\xe2\x80\x9d They wanted to go\r\non. Then outside, from the other side of the meadow, came the screech\r\nof the jay, loud and foreboding.\r\n\r\nBambi turned suddenly round and ran after Gobo. He caught up with him\r\nand Marena just before they had reached the oak tree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear that?\xe2\x80\x9d he called to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear what?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gobo in puzzlement.\r\n\r\nThe jay at the other side of the meadow screeched again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you really not hear it?\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gobo calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat means danger!\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi insisted.\r\n\r\nNow a magpie appeared, chattering as he went, and immediately after\r\nthere was another one and then, just as promptly, a third. At the same\r\ntime the jay screeched once again, and the crows gave signals from\r\nhigh in the air.\r\n\r\nFaline began to implore them too. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go out there, Gobo! It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndangerous!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven Marena now began to urge him. \xe2\x80\x9cStay here! For my sake stay here\r\ntoday ... it\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGobo stood there and grinned in embarrassment. \xe2\x80\x9cDanger! Danger! Why\r\nshould I be bothered about that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe danger of the moment gave Bambi an idea. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least let Marena go\r\nout first, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll know ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had not finished speaking before Marena had already slipped out\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAll three stood there and looked at her. Bambi and Faline held their\r\nbreath, Gobo was openly patient, as if he wanted to let the others\r\nhave their foolish way.\r\n\r\nThey watched as Marena walked, step by step, onto the meadow, slowly,\r\nher head raised high, her legs hesitant. She looked round and smelt\r\nthe air on every side.\r\n\r\nShe suddenly turned round, as quick as lightning, a high leap and, as\r\nif blown in by a storm, she was back in the thicket. \xe2\x80\x9cHe ... He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthere ...\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered in a voice that was choking in horror. Her\r\nwhole body was shaking. \xe2\x80\x9cI ... I... saw ... Him ... He ... is\r\n... there ...\xe2\x80\x9d she stammered, \xe2\x80\x9cup there ... He\xe2\x80\x99s standing there ... by\r\nthe alder tree ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s get away from here!\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi called. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, let\xe2\x80\x99s get away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome away!\xe2\x80\x9d Faline implored them. And Marena, who by now was barely\r\nable to speak, whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease Gobo, I beg of you, come away with\r\nus ... I beg of you ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Gobo remained calm. \xe2\x80\x9cRun away then, run away as far as you can?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not stopping you am I. If He\xe2\x80\x99s there I\xe2\x80\x99ll go over and\r\nsay hello.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was nothing that could have held Gobo back.\r\n\r\nThey stayed where they were and watched him as he went out onto the\r\nmeadow. They stayed behind because his immense confidence had a kind\r\nof power over them and at the same time held their terror for Him in\r\nits place. They were unable to move from the spot.\r\n\r\nGobo stood out in the open on the meadow and looked around to find the\r\nalder. Now he seemed to have found it, now he seemed to have glimpsed\r\nHim. Then the thunder-crack sounded.\r\n\r\nThe sound threw Gobo into the air, he suddenly turned round and,\r\nleaping as fast as he could, flew back into the thicket.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived they were still standing there, unable to move because\r\nof their horror. They heard the whistling of his breath, he did not\r\nstop but hurled himself forward in unthinking leaps. They turned to\r\nhim, surrounded him, and gave themselves up to full flight.\r\n\r\nBut very soon Gobo collapsed.\r\n\r\nMarena immediately stood still, close beside him. Bambi and Faline\r\nwere a little further away, ready to flee at any time.\r\n\r\nGobo\xe2\x80\x99s flank had been torn open and he lay there with his bloody\r\ninnards protruding. He made a dull movement of turning and raising his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarena ...\xe2\x80\x9d he said with some effort, \xe2\x80\x9cMarena ... He didn\xe2\x80\x99t recognize\r\nme ...\xe2\x80\x9d His voice broke off.\r\n\r\nFrom the bushes between them and the meadow, there came an uproarious\r\nnoise showing no thought of any need to be careful.\r\n\r\nMarena lowered her head down to Gobo. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s coming!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered\r\nurgently. \xe2\x80\x9cGobo ... He\xe2\x80\x99s coming ... can\xe2\x80\x99t you stand up and come with\r\nme ...?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGobo, once again, weakly turned his head and raised it. His legs\r\ntwitched violently but he continued to lie where he was.\r\n\r\nWith a clattering and a cracking and a loud rustling the bushes\r\ndivided and He entered.\r\n\r\nMarena could see him from a short distance. She slowly crept back,\r\ndisappeared behind the undergrowth, and hurried to join Bambi and\r\nFaline.\r\n\r\nShe turned around once more and there she saw Him as He bent down over\r\nthe fallen Gobo and took hold of him.\r\n\r\nThen she heard Gobo\xe2\x80\x99s pitiful scream of death.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 21\r\n\r\nBambi was by himself. He went over to the water that flowed quietly\r\nbetween the reeds and the willows on the bank.\r\n\r\nEver since he had been keeping to his own company he had come more and\r\nmore often down here. There were not many paths here and he almost\r\nnever came across any other deer. But that was just what he\r\nwanted. For his thoughts had become earnest and his spirit was\r\nheavy. He did not know what was happening inside him, and nor did he\r\ntry to work it out. He merely tried to puzzle it out in a confused\r\nway, with no plan, and it seemed to him that his whole life had become\r\ndarker.\r\n\r\nWhen he went to stand at the riverside he would spend a long time\r\nthere. He went to a place where the water flowed in a gentle curve and\r\nwhere it was possible to see a long way. The cool breathing of the\r\nripples brought an unfamiliar smell with it, a smell that was\r\nrefreshing but bitter, a smell that awoke a sense of being carefree\r\nand trusting. Bambi stood there and watched the ducks as they enjoyed\r\none another\xe2\x80\x99s company. They chatted with each other without cease,\r\nfriendly, serious and clever. There was a couple of mothers there,\r\neach of them surrounded by a crowd of children who received regular\r\ninstruction and who never tired of learning. Sometimes, one of the\r\nmothers would give out a warning sign, and the young ducks would rush\r\nout in all directions, without hesitation they would glide out as if\r\nbroadcast from a sower\xe2\x80\x99s hand and would do so in complete silence. At\r\none moment Bambi saw how the little ones, who still could not fly,\r\nwould go into the thick reeds, carefully, without touching any of the\r\nstalks which, if they moved, would betray their locations. Here and\r\nthere he saw their small, dark bodies in among the rushes as they\r\nslowly hid themselves away. Then he saw nothing more of them. A short\r\ncall from the mother, and they would all swarm around her in an\r\ninstant. In this instant her flock had gathered back together and they\r\nbegan, as before, to cruise along thoughtfully. This filled Bambi with\r\nadmiration every time he saw it. It was like a work of art.\r\n\r\nOne time, after one of these brief alarms, he asked one of the\r\nmothers, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was all that for? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been watching carefully, but\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t see anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there was nothing to see,\xe2\x80\x9d the duck replied.\r\n\r\nAnother time, one of the children gave the warning signal. He turned\r\nround as quick as a flash, steered his way through the rushes to the\r\nbank where Bambi was standing and stepped up onto it.\r\n\r\nBambi asked the little one, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened now then? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nanything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell there was nothing to see,\xe2\x80\x9d the young duck answered. Like a wise\r\nold man he shook his feathers, carefully laid the tips of his wings\r\ndown into the right place and went back into the water.\r\n\r\nBut Bambi continued to think about the ducks. He understood that they\r\nwere more watchful than he was, that their hearing was sharper and\r\ntheir eyesight better. When he stood here, the anxiety that at other\r\ntimes he was always full was slightly relieved.\r\n\r\nAnd he enjoyed talking with the ducks. They did not talk about things\r\nhe heard about so often from the others. They talked about the\r\ncapacious sky, about the wind and the distant fields where they would\r\nenjoy lots of delicious food.\r\n\r\nBambi sometimes saw something small rushing past him through the air,\r\nkeeping close to the bank, like a fire-coloured lightning flash.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSrrr-ih!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the kingfisher gently for himself as he sped past.\r\nA tiny whizzing dot. He glowed in blue and green, sparkled in red, lit\r\nhimself up and he was gone. Bambi was amazed, he was enchanted, and he\r\nwished he could see this remarkable stranger close up, so he called to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t bother with \xe2\x80\x98im,\xe2\x80\x9d the coot said up to him from the dense\r\nrushes. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t bother with \xe2\x80\x98im, you\xe2\x80\x99ll never get an answer from \xe2\x80\x98im.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bambi and peered round in the reeds.\r\n\r\nBut the laughter of the coot came up loud and clear from a quite\r\ndifferent place. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m over here! He\xe2\x80\x99s a bad tempered bloke, him who\r\nyou were trying to talk to just now, he don\xe2\x80\x99t talk with\r\nanyone. There\xe2\x80\x99s no point in trying to call to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s so beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, but he\xe2\x80\x99s no good!\xe2\x80\x9d the coot replied, again from a different\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you say that?\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi enquired.\r\n\r\nThe coot answered \xe2\x80\x93 again from a totally different place - \xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe bothered about any one or any thing. It don\xe2\x80\x99t matter what happens,\r\nhe never says hello to anyone and he never replies if anyone says\r\nhello to him. He never makes the alarm call when danger comes along\r\nand he\xe2\x80\x99s never spoken a word to anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor ...\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi started to say.\r\n\r\nThe coot continued speaking, and his cheerful, cheeping voice now,\r\nagain, came from a quite different place. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose he thinks we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nall jealous of that couple of colours he has in his feathers. I\r\nsuppose that\xe2\x80\x99s why he don\xe2\x80\x99t want to let anyone get a closer look at\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not letting me get a look at you either,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi suggested.\r\n\r\nThe coot immediately appeared in front of him. \xe2\x80\x9cWell there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\nto look at about me, is there,\xe2\x80\x9d came his simple reply. There he stood,\r\nslender, the water glittering on his back, his simple clothing, his\r\nelegant figure, ever-moving, content. And in a moment he was once more\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you can be wondering for so long about a little\r\nspeck,\xe2\x80\x9d his voice came from the water. And \xe2\x80\x93 again from a different\r\nplace - he added. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s boring to keep on about a single speck. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndangerous and all.\xe2\x80\x9d Again from another different place he proclaimed,\r\nloud, triumphantly and gaily, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to keep moving! If you want\r\nto stay safe and get your belly full, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to keep moving!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi was startled by a gentle rustling in the grass. He looked round.\r\nThere, in the bushes, he glimpsed something reddish, which disappeared\r\ninto the rushes. At the same time there came a warm but sharp\r\ntrembling in his breath. The fox slipped by. Bambi wanted to call to\r\nthe duck and stamped on the ground as a warning. There was a rustling\r\nand the reeds suddenly divided, the water splashed and the duck\r\nscreamed in confusion. Bambi heard the clatter of her wings, saw the\r\nwhiteness of her body in the shimmering greenness, and now he saw how\r\nher wings were flapping loudly and whipped against the cheeks of the\r\nfox. Then, all became quiet.\r\n\r\nVery soon afterwards the fox came up into the bushes with the duck in\r\nhis jaws. Her neck hung down loosely, her wings still moved feebly,\r\nthe fox paid no attention. He looked sideways at Bambi, and his\r\nbulging eyes seemed to be jeering, and he slipped slowly away into the\r\nthick woods.\r\n\r\nBambi stood there, motionless.\r\n\r\nSome of the older ducks had clattered up onto the bank, they flew\r\naround in confusion caused by the horror of what they had seen. The\r\ncoot sounded shrill warning cries to every side. The tits in the\r\nbushes twittered excitedly, the young ducks pushed themselves into the\r\nrushes and, having become orphans, lamented with gentle tones.\r\n\r\nThe kingfisher rushed by along the bank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease!\xe2\x80\x9d called the young ducks. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, have you seen our mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSrrr-ih!\xe2\x80\x9d the kingfisher shrieked, and seemed to sparkle as he rushed\r\npast. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi turned round and left. He wandered through a dense wilderness of\r\ngoldenrods, passed through a group of tall beech trees, went through\r\nancient hazel bushes, until he reached the edge of the great\r\ntrench. Here he wandered round at random in the hope of coming across\r\nthe elder. It was a long time since he had last seen him, not since\r\nGobo met his end.\r\n\r\nNow he saw him in the distance and ran towards him.\r\n\r\nFor a while, they walked beside each other in silence. Then the elder\r\nasked, \xe2\x80\x9cWell ... do they still talk about him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi understood that he meant Gobo, and answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know ...\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m almost always by myself ...\xe2\x80\x9d He hesitated, \xe2\x80\x9c... but ... I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstop thinking about him all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder, \xe2\x80\x9care you by yourself now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi expectantly, but the elder remained silent.\r\n\r\nThey walked on. Suddenly the elder stopped. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you hear it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi listened. No, he heard nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on!\xe2\x80\x9d the elder called as he hurried forward. Bambi followed him.\r\n\r\nThe elder stopped again. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you still not hear it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi now could make out a sound that he did not understand. It was as\r\nif twigs were being pulled down and then allowed to snap up again. At\r\nthe same time there were dull and irregular thumps on the ground.\r\n\r\nBambi wanted to flee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome with me!\xe2\x80\x9d the elder called and ran in the direction of the\r\nnoise. Bambi dared to ask, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it not dangerous there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is!\xe2\x80\x9d the elder replied mysteriously. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very dangerous there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were soon able to see the twigs that were being pulled down from\r\nbelow and were being shaken, and they saw the vigour with which they\r\nsprang back up. They came closer and noticed that there was a little\r\npath running through the middle of the bushes.\r\n\r\nBambi\xe2\x80\x99s friend the hare lay on the ground, threw himself back and\r\nforth, fidgeted about, lay still, fidgeted some more, and each of his\r\nmovements tore at the twigs above him.\r\n\r\nBambi became aware of a dark stripe, something like a tendril. It\r\nbecame stiff and dropped down onto the hare, where it wound itself\r\naround his neck.\r\n\r\nBy now, the hare must have heard that there was somebody coming. He\r\nhurled himself into the air, fell back to the ground, wanted to flee,\r\ndefeated he rolled himself into ball and quivered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep still!\xe2\x80\x9d the elder ordered him and then, in a gentle and\r\nsympathetic voice that struck at Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s heart, he went over close to\r\nthe hare and repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cStay calm, my friend, it\xe2\x80\x99s only me! Don\xe2\x80\x99t move\r\nat all. Just keep very still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hare lay motionless, flat on the ground. His breathing was tense,\r\nand it made a gentle sound.\r\n\r\nThe elder took the twig with the peculiar tendril into his mouth,\r\npulled it down, turned round elegantly, held it firmly against the\r\nground under his hard hoof and did away with it with a single blow of\r\nhis crown.\r\n\r\nThen he turned to the hare. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep still,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ceven if it hurts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith his head turned to one side, he laid one of the points of his\r\ncrown against the hare\xe2\x80\x99s neck and pressed it deeply into his fur\r\nbehind his ears, felt around for something and gave a yank. The hare\r\nbegan to writhe.\r\n\r\nThe elder immediately moved back. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep still!\xe2\x80\x9d he ordered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ntrying to save your life!\xe2\x80\x9d He began anew. The hare lay still, but\r\nquivering. Bambi watched in astonishment, he was speechless.\r\n\r\nNow the elder had pushed one point of his antlers firmly into the\r\nhare\xe2\x80\x99s fur, trying to get it under whatever was slung around the\r\nhare\xe2\x80\x99s neck. He was nearly on his knees but twisted his head as if\r\ndrilling a hole, pushed his crown deeper and deeper until finally,\r\nwhatever it was gave way and began to loosen.\r\n\r\nThe hare drew breath and at the same time gave in to his fear, his\r\npain broke loudly out from him. \xe2\x80\x9cE ... e ... eh!\xe2\x80\x9d he wailed.\r\n\r\nThe elder stopped what he was doing. \xe2\x80\x9cDo be quiet,\xe2\x80\x9d he chided, \xe2\x80\x9cbe\r\nquiet!\xe2\x80\x9d His mouth was very close to the hare\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, one of the\r\npoints of his crown was between the ears and it looked as if he had\r\nimpaled the hare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you be so stupid and start to cry?\xe2\x80\x9d he gently grumbled. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou want to get the fox to come here? Yes? Well then. Keep quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe continued to work, slowly, carefully, attentively. Suddenly the\r\nsling around the hare\xe2\x80\x99s neck began to slip off. The hare slid out of\r\nit and he was free before he even knew it. He made a step or two and\r\nthen sat there in a daze. Then he hopped away. Slowly at first, shyly,\r\nbut all the time getting faster until he ran away in wild leaps.\r\n\r\nBambi looked at him as he went. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd not a word of thanks!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ndeclared in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite come back to his senses,\xe2\x80\x9d the elder said.\r\n\r\nWhatever it was that had been around the hare\xe2\x80\x99s neck lay now in a\r\ncircle on the ground. Bambi kicked at it lightly; it made a jangling\r\nnoise and Bambi was startled. That was the sort of noise that did not\r\nbelong in the forest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHim ...?\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi asked quietly. The elder nodded.\r\n\r\nThey walked on calmly next to each other. \xe2\x80\x9cYou always need to be\r\ncareful,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re walking along a path you should\r\nalways pay attention to the twigs on the trees and bushes, stretch\r\nyour crown out, up and down, and if you ever hear that jangling noise\r\nturn right round. But if it\xe2\x80\x99s the time of year when you\xe2\x80\x99re not\r\ncarrying a crown on your head you need to be doubly careful. I stopped\r\ngoing along the paths a long time ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi was alarmed and wondered what the elder had meant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut ... but He\xe2\x80\x99s not ...\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself in bewilderment.\r\n\r\nThe elder answered, \xe2\x80\x9cno ... He\xe2\x80\x99s not in the forest right now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut ... but it\xe2\x80\x99s Him!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi, shaking his head.\r\n\r\nThe elder continued, and his voice was full of bitterness. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was\r\nit that Gobo said to you ...? Did he not give you a lecture about how\r\nHe is almighty, how he is responsible for of everything ...?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi spluttered, \xe2\x80\x9cIs He not almighty then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s no more almighty than He is responsible for all,\xe2\x80\x9d the elder\r\ncomplained.\r\n\r\nBambi was disheartened. \xe2\x80\x9c... But what about Gobo ... He was good to\r\nGobo ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe elder stopped where he was. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you really think he was, Bambi?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe asked sadly. This was the first time that the elder had addressed\r\nhim by his name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know!\xe2\x80\x9d declared Bambi in anguish. \xe2\x80\x9cI just don\xe2\x80\x99t understand\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe elder replied slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cIf we are to live we need to learn ... and\r\nto be vigilant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 22\r\n\r\nOne morning, something very bad happened to Bambi.\r\n\r\nThe feeble grey of dawn was creeping its way through the forest. A\r\nmilky-white mist rose from the meadow and the quiet that breathes the\r\nchange in the time of day stretched itself out everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe crows were still not awake, nor the magpies, and even the jay was\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nBambi had come across Faline in the night. She looked sadly at him and\r\nwas very shy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m by myself so much,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m by myself too,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi replied hesitantly.\r\n\r\nFaline seemed disheartened and asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you stay with me any\r\nmore?\xe2\x80\x9d and it pained Bambi to see that Faline, once so gay, once so\r\nbold, had become earnest and downtrodden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have to be alone,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. He had wanted to say it in a\r\nsoothing way, but it sounded hard. He heard it himself.\r\n\r\nFaline looked at him and quietly asked, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you still love me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi did not hesitate and answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went calmly away and left him alone.\r\n\r\nThere he stood under the great oak tree at the edge of the meadow,\r\nlooked carefully out there to see that all was safe, and drank in the\r\nmorning wind. Every time there had been a storm the air was moist and\r\nrefreshing, it smelt of the earth, of dew and grass and of wet\r\nwood. Bambi breathed deep. He suddenly felt free in a way he had not\r\nfelt for a long time. He felt gay as he stepped out onto the misty\r\nmeadow.\r\n\r\nThen came a clap of thunder.\r\n\r\nBambi felt as if something had shoved him and it made him stagger.\r\n\r\nIn a panic he leapt back into the woods and continued running. He did\r\nnot understand what had happened, he was quite unable to collect his\r\nthoughts but just kept on running. His terror kept a tight grip on his\r\nheart and took his breath away as he blindly rushed forward. But then,\r\nsuddenly, a piercing pain ran through him, he did not think he would\r\nbe able endure it. He felt how it ran hotly over his left thigh, a\r\nnarrow, burning thread starting from the place where he had first felt\r\nthe pain. It forced him to stop running. It forced him to walk more\r\nslowly. Then his shoulders and legs seemed to go lame. He collapsed to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nHe was seen by Labsal as he just lay there resting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet up Bambi! Get up!\xe2\x80\x9d The elder stood beside him and pushed him\r\ngently on his shoulder.\r\n\r\nBambi wanted to retort, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d but the elder said again, \xe2\x80\x9cGet up!\r\nGet up!\xe2\x80\x9d and there was such urgency in his voice and such tenderness\r\nthat Bambi said nothing. Even the pain he felt in every part of his\r\nbody abated for a moment.\r\n\r\nNow the elder spoke hurriedly and in fear. \xe2\x80\x9cGet up! You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get\r\naway from here, son!\xe2\x80\x9d Son ... it seemed to be as soon as this word\r\nslipped out of his mouth that Bambi hurried back up on his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight, then!\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder. He took a deep breath and continued to\r\nurge Bambi on. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, come with me, just stay with me all the time\r\n...!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hurried forward. Bambi followed him, even though he was yearning to\r\ndrop to the ground, to lay still and rest.\r\n\r\nThe elder seemed able to see this and spoke to Bambi without pause.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever the pain is you\xe2\x80\x99ve now got to just bear it, you can\xe2\x80\x99t even\r\nthink about lying down ... never think of that at all, as that by\r\nitself will make you tired! Now you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to just save yourself\r\n... do you understand, Bambi? ... save yourself ... otherwise you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nlost ... just bear in mind that He\xe2\x80\x99s coming after you ... do you\r\nunderstand, Bambi? ... He won\xe2\x80\x99t show any mercy ... He\xe2\x80\x99ll just kill you\r\n... come with me ... just come with me ... it\xe2\x80\x99ll soon be gone ... it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot to go ...\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi no longer even had the strength to think of\r\nanything. The pain surged up in every step he took, robbed im of his\r\nbreath and of his senses, and the line of heat that burned down into\r\nhis shoulder brought a deep, delirious excitement into his heart.\r\n\r\nThe elder went round in a broad circle. It took a long time. Through\r\nhis veil of pain and weakness Bambi was astonished to see that they\r\nwere suddenly beside the great oak once more.\r\n\r\nThe elder stopped and smelt the ground. \xe2\x80\x9cHere!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, \xe2\x80\x9chere\r\n... He\xe2\x80\x99s here ... here too ... the dog ... come with me ... faster!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey ran on. The elder suddenly stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you see ...!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is where you were lying on the\r\nground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi saw where the grass had been pressed down and saw a broad pool\r\nof his own blood soaking down into the ground.\r\n\r\nThe elder smelt the place carefully. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve already been here ...\r\nHim and the dog ...\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, come with me!\xe2\x80\x9d He walked slowly\r\non, continually stopping to smell the ground.\r\n\r\nBambi noticed the drops of red on the leaves of the bushes and on the\r\ngrass. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve already been past here,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, although he was not\r\nable to speak out loud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder, almost gaily, \xe2\x80\x9cnow we\xe2\x80\x99ve got behind them ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went for a while in the same direction. Then he turned suddenly to\r\none side and set off in a new circle. Bambi staggered on behind him.\r\n\r\nThey arrived at the big oak tree once again, though this time from the\r\nother direction, they arrived once again at the place where Bambi had\r\nfallen, and then, once again, the elder took a new direction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEat some of this!\xe2\x80\x9d he ordered, he had stopped, pushed the grass to\r\none side and pointed to some tiny leaves, short and dark green, fat\r\nand fluffy, that were sprouting out of the bare ground.\r\n\r\nBambi did as he was told. The leaves were horribly bitter and had a\r\nrepulsive smell.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the elder asked, \xe2\x80\x9cHow are you feeling now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m feeling better,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi promptly answered. All of a sudden he was\r\nable to speak again, he could think clearly, he felt less tired.\r\n\r\nAfter another pause the elder ordered him, \xe2\x80\x9cYou go ahead now,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nafter he had been walking behind Bambi for some time he said, \xe2\x80\x9cAt\r\nlast!\xe2\x80\x9d They stopped. \xe2\x80\x9cYour blood has stopped running out from your\r\nwound, so it won\xe2\x80\x99t show where you are any more, He and His dog won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe able to find where to go to take your life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe elder looked very tired, but there was cheer in his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\non then,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cnow you need to have a rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey arrived at the broad gulley that Bambi had never been across. The\r\nelder climbed down into it, Bambi tried to follow but it took him a\r\nlot of effort to climb up the steep slope on the other side.\r\n\r\nThe fierce pain he felt began once more to go through him. He fell\r\nover, pulled himself back up, fell over again and began to gasp for\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help you here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get up here\r\nyourself!\xe2\x80\x9d And Bambi did get up to the top. He began once more to feel\r\nthe hot band of pain that shot down his shoulder and felt for the\r\nsecond time that he was losing his strength.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re bleeding again,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s what I expected. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot too much, though ... and ...,\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cit doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmatter any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey made their way very slowly through a grove of beech trees, as\r\nhigh as the sky. The ground was soft and smooth. It did not take too\r\nmuch effort to go through it. Bambi yearned to just lay himself down\r\nhere, to stretch himself out and not to move a finger. He just could\r\nnot go any further. His head hurt, there was a buzzing in his ears,\r\nhis nerves were quivering and his fever began to shake him. His eyes\r\nwent dim. There was nothing more inside him than the yearning for rest\r\nand a vague astonishment at how his life had suddenly been interrupted\r\nand altered, at how he had once used to go through the forest in good\r\nhealth and without injury ... just that morning ... just an hour\r\nearlier ... it seemed to him now like the happiness of a distant time\r\nthat had long since vanished.\r\n\r\nThey passed through a low thicket of oaks and dogwood. The fallen\r\ntrunk of a beech tree lay across their path, deeply embedded in the\r\nbushes. It was very big and they could see no way of getting past it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99ve got there ...\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi heard the elder say. He walked the\r\nlength of the beech trunk and Bambi followed him, nearly falling into\r\na hole in the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlright!\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can lie down here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi sank down and did not try to move any more.\r\n\r\nHe saw that the hole in the ground under the fallen beech trunk was\r\ndeeper than it had seemed, creating a small chamber. The bushes at the\r\nedge of it closed over him as he entered so that nobody could see\r\nin. Once he was down there it was as if he had disappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be safe here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder. \xe2\x80\x9cStay here and don\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\nanywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDays went by.\r\n\r\nBambi lay in the warm earth, the bark of the fallen tree slowly\r\nrotting above him, it listened to his pain as it grew inside his body,\r\nbecame stronger, then abated, became weaker and went down, steadily\r\nsofter and softer. Sometimes he would struggle outside where he would\r\nstand, weak and unsteady, on his tired and unreliable legs, and take a\r\nfew steps to look for food. He began to eat herbs that he had never\r\nbefore noticed. Now they had suddenly begun to offer themselves to\r\nhim, called to him with their scent that had a strange and tempting\r\nsharpness. What he had until then despised, what he would have thrown\r\naway if he inadvertently got it between his lips, now seemed tasty and\r\nspicy. Many little leaves, many short stalks continued to seem\r\nunappetizing even now, but he nonetheless ate them under some kind of\r\ncompulsion, and his wounds healed more quickly and he could feel how\r\nhis strength was coming back to him.\r\n\r\nHe had been saved. But he still did not leave his chamber. He would\r\nonly come out at night and take a few steps around, but in the daytime\r\nhe would remain quietly in his bed. It was only now, when his body was\r\nfeeling no more pain, that Bambi realized all that had happened to\r\nhim, he was able to think once more, and a feeling of great horror\r\narose within him, his character had been shattered. He was not able to\r\nsimply wipe it away, not able to stand up and run about as he had\r\nbefore. He lay there and felt many emotions, alternately disgusted,\r\nashamed, astonished, disheartened, but soon afterwards full of\r\nmelancholy, soon afterwards full of happiness.\r\n\r\nThe elder was nearby at all times. At first he was at Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s side day\r\nand night. Then there were times when he left him alone for short\r\nperiods, especially when he saw that Bambi was lost in his\r\nthoughts. But there was no time when he was not close by.\r\n\r\nOne day there had been storm and thunder and lightning, the sky had\r\nbeen swept clean and that evening the sun, as it went down, shone over\r\na sky that was blue. The blackbirds sang out loudly from the tree\r\ntops, the finches flapped their wings, the tits whispered in the\r\nundergrowth, in the grass and under the bushes close to the ground the\r\nmetallic bursts of the pheasants\xe2\x80\x99 cries could be heard, the woodpecker\r\nlaughed in loud celebration and the pigeons cooed from the yearning\r\nfor love that was inside them.\r\n\r\nBambi stepped out from his underground chamber. Life was good. The\r\nelder was standing there as if he had been waiting.\r\n\r\nThe wandered slowly off together.\r\n\r\nBut Bambi never went back across that gulley, never went back to see\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 23\r\n\r\nOne night, when the autumn leaves were falling and whispering through\r\nthe whole of the forest, the tawny owl gave his shrill cry through the\r\ntree tops. Then he waited.\r\n\r\nBut Bambi had already seen him in the distance through the now sparse\r\nfoliage and now he kept still.\r\n\r\nThe owl flew closer and gave his shrill cry even louder. Then he\r\nwaited. But this time too, Bambi said nothing.\r\n\r\nThe owl could not hold back any longer. \xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you startled, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe asked discontentedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi answered gently. \xe2\x80\x9cA little bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell ...,\xe2\x80\x9d the owl grumbled, \xe2\x80\x9conly a little bit? You always used to\r\nbe terribly shocked. It was always such a pleasure to see how shocked\r\nyou were. What\xe2\x80\x99s happened then, what\xe2\x80\x99s happened that means your only a\r\nlittle bit shocked ...?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was annoyed and repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cjust a little bit ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe owl had grown old, and that had made him even more vain and even\r\nmore sensitive than he had been.\r\n\r\nBambi wanted to answer; I was never startled before, either, but I\r\njust said I was because I knew you liked it. But he decided he would\r\nrather keep this information to himself. He felt sorry for the good\r\nold owl, as he sat there being cross. He did his best to calm him\r\ndown. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe it\xe2\x80\x99s because I was just thinking about you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d The owl became cheerful again. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat? You were thinking about\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Bambi hesitantly, \xe2\x80\x9cjust when began to screech.\r\nOtherwise, of course, I would have been just as startled as ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d the owl purred.\r\n\r\nBambi could not resist. What harm could there be in it? Let the little\r\nold boy have some pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally,\xe2\x80\x9d he confirmed and went on .\xe2\x80\x9d.. it pleases me ... it goes\r\nthrough all my limbs when I suddenly hear you like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe owl puffed up his feathers, turned himself into a soft, brown and\r\nlight grey, fluffy ball, and he was very pleased. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s very nice of\r\nyou to have been thinking about me ... very nice indeed ...\xe2\x80\x9d he cooed\r\ngently. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s such a long time since we saw each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very long time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe it\xe2\x80\x99s that you don\xe2\x80\x99t go along the same old paths any more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nenquired the owl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo ...,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi spoke slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t go along the same old paths any\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeing a lot more of the world too lately,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the\r\nowl, puffing his chest out. He did not tell Bambi that he had been\r\ndriven out of the old territory he had inherited from his ancestors by\r\na young and reckless lad. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t always stay on the same spot,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded. Then he waited for Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s reply.\r\n\r\nBut Bambi had gone. By now he had learned the art of disappearing in\r\nsilence almost as well as the elder.\r\n\r\nThe owl was dismayed. \xe2\x80\x9cShameless ...\xe2\x80\x9d he grumbled. He shook himself,\r\nburied his beak into his plumage and philosophized to himself; \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nshould never think you could make friends with these posh types. They\r\nmight seem ever so likeable ... but one day they\xe2\x80\x99ll shamelessly\r\n... and then you sit there looking stupid, just like I am now ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly he fell vertically down to the ground like a stone. He had\r\nseen a mouse, which then, caught in his talons, had the time to squeal\r\njust once. He tore the mouse into pieces because he was so angry. He\r\npulled the head off this mouthful quicker than he normally would. And\r\nthen he flew away. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does Bambi matter to me?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\ndoes any of those posh people matter to me? Nothing. They don\xe2\x80\x99t matter\r\nat all!\xe2\x80\x9d He started to screech. So shrill, so long, that a pair of\r\nwood pigeons he passed by were woken up and, with much loud flapping\r\nof wings, they fell out of where they had been sleeping.\r\n\r\nThe storm blew through the woods for many days, tearing the last of\r\nthe leaves from the twigs and branches. The trees now stood there\r\nnaked.\r\n\r\nIn the grey of morning twilight Bambi was making his way home in order\r\nto sleep together with the elder in their chamber.\r\n\r\nA thin voice called to him, two times, three times in quick\r\nsuccession. He stayed where he was. Then the squirrel swooped down\r\nfrom the tree like lightning and sat on the ground in front of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt really is you, then!\xe2\x80\x9d he piped with respectful astonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nrecognized you straight away when you passed by me, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really\r\nwant to believe it ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow come you\xe2\x80\x99re here ...?\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi asked.\r\n\r\nThe cheerful, little face in front of him took on a worried\r\nexpression. \xe2\x80\x9cThe oak tree is gone ...\xe2\x80\x9d the squirrel began to complain,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmy lovely old oak tree ... do you remember? It\xe2\x80\x99s terrible ... He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncut it down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi lowered his head in sadness. It really did hurt his soul to hear\r\nabout the wonderful ancient tree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt all happened so quickly,\xe2\x80\x9d the squirrel told him. \xe2\x80\x9cAll of us who\r\nlived on the old tree, we all ran away and we could only watch as He\r\nbit through it with an enormous blinking tooth. The tree screamed out\r\nloud from his wound. He just kept on screaming, and the tooth screamed\r\ntoo ... it was horrible to hear it. Then that poor, lovely tree fell\r\nover. Out onto the meadow ... it made all of us cry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes ...\xe2\x80\x9d said the squirrel with a sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cHe can do anything ...  He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nomnipotent ...\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at Bambi with eyes wide open and pricked up\r\nhis ears, but Bambi was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve all got nowhere to live now ...\xe2\x80\x9d the squirrel continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t even have any idea of where the others have got to ... I came\r\nover here ... but it\xe2\x80\x99ll take me ages to find another tree like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old oak tree ...,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Bambi to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve known it\r\nsince I was a child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo ... but it\xe2\x80\x99s good to see that it\xe2\x80\x99s really you!\xe2\x80\x9d The squirrel\r\nbecame quite contented. \xe2\x80\x9cWe all thought you must have died a long time\r\nago. But there were some who said you were still alive ... some said\r\nthat someone or other had seen you ... but we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find out\r\nanything definite, so we just supposed it was an empty rumour ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe squirrel looked at him searchingly. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, that was ... that was\r\nbecause you didn\xe2\x80\x99t come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat there waiting for an answer, you could see that he was very\r\nkeen to know what had happened.\r\n\r\nBambi was silent. But he, too, felt a slight, anxious curiosity. He\r\nwanted to ask. About Faline, about Aunt Ena, about Ronno and Karus,\r\nabout everyone he had known as a child. But he was silent.\r\n\r\nThe squirrel continued to sit in front of Bambi and examined\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at that crown!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed in admiration. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a crown!\r\nApart from the old prince, no-one has a crown like that, no-one\r\nanywhere in the forest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEarlier, Bambi would have felt very pleased and flattered by an\r\nobservation like this. Now he just said wearily, \xe2\x80\x9cYes ... I suppose so\r\n...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe squirrel nodded his head vigorously. \xe2\x80\x9cIt really is!\xe2\x80\x9d he said in\r\nastonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cReally. You\xe2\x80\x99re beginning to go grey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi walked away.\r\n\r\nThe squirrel saw that the discussion was at an end and swung up into\r\nthe branches. \xe2\x80\x9cBye then,\xe2\x80\x9d he called down. \xe2\x80\x9cLook after yourself! I\r\nenjoyed seeing you again. If I see any of your old friends I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nthem you\xe2\x80\x99re still alive ... they\xe2\x80\x99ll all be glad to hear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi heard this and once again felt those slight stirrings in his\r\nheart. But it said nothing. You have to stay alone, the elder had\r\ntaught him when Bambi was still a child. And the elder had shown him\r\nmany things, told him many secrets, and continued doing so up to the\r\npresent day. But of all the things he had been taught, this was the\r\nmost important: You have to stay alone. If you\xe2\x80\x99re going to preserve\r\nyour life, if you want to understand existence, if you want to become\r\nwise, you have to stay alone!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bambi one time, \xe2\x80\x9cbut what about the two of us, we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nalways together nowadays ...?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe soon won\xe2\x80\x99t be,\xe2\x80\x9d the elder had retorted.\r\n\r\nThat had only been a few weeks earlier.\r\n\r\nNow, it again occurred to Bambi, and it occurred to him very suddenly,\r\nthat the very first thing the elder had said to him had been that he\r\nhad to stay alone. That had been when Bambi was still a child and was\r\ncalling for his mother. Then the elder had come up to him and asked,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you not able to be alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi walked on.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 24\r\n\r\nThe forest lay once more under snow and was silent under its thick,\r\nwhite coat. All that could be heard was the cawing of the crows, only\r\nnow and then came the anxious croaking of a magpie or the shy, gentle,\r\ntwittering conversations of the tits. Then the frost became harder,\r\nand everything was silent. Now, the coldness made the air itself ring.\r\n\r\nOne morning the deep quiet was torn apart by the barking of dogs.\r\n\r\nIt was an incessant, hurried barking that drove its way quickly\r\nthrough the forest, a sharp, curt and belligerent yapping that made\r\nhim sound insane.\r\n\r\nIn the chamber under the fallen beech trunk Bambi raised his head and\r\nlooked at the elder who was lying next to him.\r\n\r\nThe elder answered Bambi\xe2\x80\x99s look. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing, nothing that need\r\nconcern us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two of them nonetheless listened.\r\n\r\nThey lay in their chamber, they had the old beech trunk as a\r\nprotective roof over them, icy draughts were kept out by the height of\r\nthe snow, and the tangle of bushes hid them like a dense grid from any\r\nspying eye.\r\n\r\nThe barking came nearer, angry, breathless, heated. It could only have\r\nbeen a small dog.\r\n\r\nIt came ever nearer. Now they could hear the gasping for breath at\r\ntwice the speed, and through the angry barking they heard a gentle\r\ngrowling, as if from pain. Bambi became uneasy, but the elder again\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that need concern us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey remained still and quiet in the warmth of their chamber, peering\r\nout to see what was happening outside.\r\n\r\nThe rustling in the twigs came ever nearer, snow fell from the boughs\r\nas they were suddenly run past, a dust of snow was kicked up from the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nNow it was possible to see who was coming.\r\n\r\nThrough snow and bushes, through roots and twigs there came, jumping\r\nand creeping and sliding, the old fox.\r\n\r\nImmediately after him the dog broke through. It was a very small dog\r\non short legs.\r\n\r\nOne of the fox\xe2\x80\x99s front legs was broken and just above the break his\r\nfur was ripped open. He held the broken leg high up in front of him,\r\nblood was spurting from his wounds, his breath was wheezy, his eyes\r\nwere staring far ahead because of his horror and the efforts he was\r\nhaving to make. He was beside himself with terror and panic, he was\r\nconfused and exhausted. He swung round in a swiping movement, which\r\nstartled the dog so that he stepped back a few paces.\r\n\r\nThe fox sat down on his hind legs. He could go no further. He held the\r\nshot foreleg up in a way that was pitiful, his mouth was open, sucking\r\nin his cheeks he spat at the dog.\r\n\r\nHe, though, was not quiet for a moment. His high, shrill voice now\r\nbecame fuller and deeper. \xe2\x80\x9cHere!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. Here! Here he is! Here!\r\nHere! Here!\xe2\x80\x9d He was not shouting at the fox, at that moment he was not\r\nspeaking to him at all but was clearly calling to somebody else who\r\nwas still a long way away.\r\n\r\nBambi and the elder were both aware that it was Him whom the dog was\r\ncalling.\r\n\r\nThe fox knew it too. The blood was now gushing down from his breast\r\nand into the snow and built up a gently steaming, scarlet stain on the\r\nicy-white layer.\r\n\r\nThe fox seemed to be having a mild fit. His shattered foreleg had no\r\nstrength in it and it sank down, but when it touched the cold snow a\r\nburning pain shot through it. Arduously, he raised it up and held it,\r\njittering, in the air in front of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me alone ...\xe2\x80\x9d he began to say. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave me alone ...\xe2\x80\x9d. He spoke\r\nquietly and imploringly. He was very dull and disheartened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! No! No!\xe2\x80\x9d the dog threw back at him in a malevolent howl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg of you ...\xe2\x80\x9d said the fox, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go any further ... I\xe2\x80\x99ve had\r\nit .. just let me go ... let me go home ... at least let me die in\r\npeace ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! No! No!\xe2\x80\x9d the dog howled.\r\n\r\nThe fox begged him even harder. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we\xe2\x80\x99re related ...\xe2\x80\x9d he lamented,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re almost brothers ... let me go home ... let me die among my own\r\nfolk ... we ... we\xe2\x80\x99re almost brothers ... you and me ...\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! No! No!\xe2\x80\x9d the dog said excitedly.\r\n\r\nNow the fox sat upright. His lovely pointed snout sank down to his\r\nbloodied breast, his eyes rose up and stared at the dog right into his\r\nface . In a quite different voice, in control of himself, sad and\r\nbitter, he snarled, \xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you ashamed of yourself ...? You traitor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! No! No!\xe2\x80\x9d the dog yelled.\r\n\r\nThe fox, however went on. \xe2\x80\x9cYou turncoat ... you defector!\xe2\x80\x9d His\r\nlacerated body became stiff with hatred and contempt. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re just His\r\nhenchman,\xe2\x80\x9d he hissed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou miserable ... you seek us out where He\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t find us ... you persecute us in places that He can\xe2\x80\x99t get to\r\n... you turn us in ..., and all of us are your relatives ... you turn\r\nme in, and you and I are nearly brothers ... and you just stand there\r\n...are you not ashamed of yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly many loud, new voices were heard around them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTraitor!\xe2\x80\x9d called the magpies from the trees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenchman!\xe2\x80\x9d screeched the jays.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiserable!\xe2\x80\x9d squealed the weasel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDefector!\xe2\x80\x9d spat the polecat.\r\n\r\nShrill hisses and screeches came out from all the trees and bushes,\r\nand from the air came the screeching of the crows, \xe2\x80\x9chenchman!\xe2\x80\x9d All had\r\nhurried close, all had listened to the quarrel from the trees above or\r\nfrom a safe hiding place on the ground. The disgust expressed by the\r\nfox released the old, bitter disgust that they all felt, and the blood\r\nsteaming in sight of them on the snow made them furious and made them\r\nlose all their reserve.\r\n\r\nThe dog looked around him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou!\xe2\x80\x9d he called. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want? What\r\ndo you know about it? What are you talking about? All o\xe2\x80\x99 you belong to\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Im, just like I belong to \xe2\x80\x98Im! But me ... well I love \xe2\x80\x98Im, I pray to\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Im! I serve \xe2\x80\x98Im! But you, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know that \xe2\x80\x98E\xe2\x80\x99s in charge\r\n\xe2\x80\x98ere. You\xe2\x80\x99re pitiful you are, you can\xe2\x80\x99t rebel against \xe2\x80\x98Im? \xe2\x80\x98E\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nalmighty! \xe2\x80\x98E\xe2\x80\x99s above all of us! Ev\xe2\x80\x99rything you\xe2\x80\x99ve got comes from \xe2\x80\x98Im!\r\nE\xe2\x80\x99vrything that grows and lives, it all comes from \xe2\x80\x98Im.\xe2\x80\x9d The dog was\r\nshaking in his outrage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTraitor!\xe2\x80\x9d the squirrel screamed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d hissed the fox. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a traitor. Nobody but you ... you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nthe only one ...!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey danced about in self-righteous anger. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the only one ...? You\r\nliar! D\xe2\x80\x99you think there aren\xe2\x80\x99t loads and loads of others who are with\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Im ...? The \xe2\x80\x98orse ... the cows ... the lamb ... the chickens ... and\r\nsome of all of you, all your species, there are loads who are with\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Im, who pray to \xe2\x80\x98im ... and serve \xe2\x80\x98Im!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRabble!\xe2\x80\x9d hissed the fox, full of boundless contempt.\r\n\r\nThe dog could control himself no longer and hurled himself at the\r\nfox\xe2\x80\x99s throat. A snarling, spitting, gasping bundle, wild and whirring\r\nthey rolled in the snow, snapping at each other, hair flew up, snow\r\nflew up, fine drops of blood flew up. But the fox was not able to\r\nmaintain the fight for long. After just a few seconds he lay there on\r\nhis back, showed his pale belly, twitched, stretched himself out, and\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nThe dog shook him a few more times, then dropped him into the churned\r\nup snow, stood there with his legs wide apart and once more called out\r\nin a full, deep voice, \xe2\x80\x9cThere! There! There he is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe others were disgusted and fled away in all directions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorrible ...\xe2\x80\x9d said Bambi in his chamber to the elder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorst of all,\xe2\x80\x9d the elder replied, \xe2\x80\x9cis that they believe in what the\r\ndog just said. They believe it, they live a life full of fear, they\r\nhate Him and they hate themselves ... and they kill themselves for his\r\nsake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 25\r\n\r\nThere came a break in the cold and a pause in the middle of\r\nwinter. The Earth drank in the melting snow in great draughts, so that\r\nbroad stretches of naked earth could be seen everywhere. The\r\nblackbirds were not singing yet but when they flew up from the ground\r\nwhere they had been hunting for worms, or when they flapped from tree\r\nto tree, they let out a long, shrill, cheerful cry which was almost\r\nlike birdsong. The woodpecker began to laugh here and there, magpies\r\nand crows became more chatty, the tits talked gaily with each other,\r\nand the pheasants, when they had swung down from the trees where they\r\nhad been sleeping, now remained in one spot for almost as long as they\r\nwould in the good times, they would shake their plumage in the morning\r\nsunshine and continually burst out with their metallic cry.\r\n\r\nOn mornings like this Bambi would range out further afield than he\r\nnormally would. When the sun had barely risen he arrived at his\r\nchamber under the beech tree. Over on the other side, there where he\r\nhad used to live, there was something moving. Bambi remained hidden in\r\nthe undergrowth and watched. He was right, someone of his own species\r\nwas moving about there, seeking out the patches that were free of snow\r\nand setting about the early-risen grasses.\r\n\r\nAt first, Bambi wanted to turn round and go away, but then he saw that\r\nit was Faline. His first urge was to jump forward and call to her. But\r\nhe stayed where he was as if rooted to the spot. It was so long since\r\nhe had last seen Faline. His heart began to beat hotly. Faline was\r\nwalking slowly, as if she were tired or sad. She looked like her\r\nmother now, looked like Aunt Ena, and when Bambi noticed this it was\r\nwith painful astonishment.\r\n\r\nFaline raised her head and looked in his direction, as if she could\r\nfeel that he was near.\r\n\r\nAgain, Bambi felt the urge to go toward her, but, again, he stayed\r\nwhere he was, powerless and lame, he was unable to move.\r\n\r\nHe saw that Faline had become old and grey.\r\n\r\nGay and audacious little Faline, he thought, she used to be so\r\nbeautiful, so nimble. His entire childhood suddenly shimmered up in\r\nhim. The meadow, the paths his mother led him along, the happy games\r\nwith Gobo and Faline, the good grasshopper and the butterfly, the\r\nstruggle with Karus and Ronno by which he had won Faline for\r\nhimself. He suddenly felt happy again, but nonetheless shaken.\r\n\r\nOver there, Faline was walking away with her head sunk down to the\r\nground, slow, tired and sad. At that moment Bambi loved her with a\r\ngush of tender pity, he wanted to cross through the hole under the\r\nbeech trunk, which for so long had separated him from her and from the\r\nothers, wanted to fetch her back, to talk to her about the time when\r\nthey had been children, above all to talk about the past.\r\n\r\nAs he thought this he watched her as she went on through the bare\r\nbushes and finally disappeared from sight.\r\n\r\nHe stood there for a long time, looking in her direction.\r\n\r\nA clap of thunder crashed. Bambi was startled.\r\n\r\nThat was here, on this side of the hole. Not very close, but here, on\r\nthe side where he was.\r\n\r\nAnother crash of thunder came, and then another.\r\n\r\nBambi made a few steps deeper back into the thicket, where he kept\r\nstill and listened. Everything was quiet. He crept carefully home.\r\n\r\nThe elder was already there, but had not gone down into their chamber,\r\nhe just stood next to the fallen beech trunk as if he had been\r\nwaiting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you been all this time?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, and he was so serious\r\nthat Bambi remained silent. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear that, just now?\xe2\x80\x9d the elder\r\nwent on after a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThree times. He\xe2\x80\x99s in the forest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClearly ...,\xe2\x80\x9d the elder nodded, and he repeated, with a strange\r\ninflexion, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is in the forest ... we need to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi could not stop himself from asking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder, and his voice was heavy. \xe2\x80\x9cOver there\r\nwhere He is now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi was alarmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened,\xe2\x80\x9d the elder went on. \xe2\x80\x9cCome with me now and don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe afraid. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the chance to take you there and let you\r\nsee it ...\xe2\x80\x9d He hesitated and gently added, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore I go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi was taken aback at this and stared at the elder. He suddenly\r\nbecame aware of how frail he looked; his head was now entirely white,\r\nhis face had become very gaunt, his beautiful eyes had lost their\r\nsparkle, they had taken on a dull green appearance and seemed to be\r\nsomehow broken.\r\n\r\nBambi and the elder did not go far, they could feel the first winds of\r\na heavy storm blowing at them, a storm that was capable of putting so\r\nmuch threat and dread into their hearts.\r\n\r\nBambi stopped, but the elder carried on walking, directly towards the\r\nstorm. Bambi hesitantly followed behind him.\r\n\r\nThe scent of the storm came at them in ever stronger waves and drew\r\nthem forward. The elder went straight on. Thoughts of flight had\r\nsprung into Bambi, he could feel tension in his breast which boiled\r\nthrough his head and all his limbs. They nearly tore him away from the\r\nplace. He stayed strong and continued to walk behind the elder.\r\n\r\nNow this malevolent storm had swollen up into something so mighty that\r\nthere was nothing else it was possible to feel, and so that it was now\r\nbarely possible to breathe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder, and he stepped to one side.\r\n\r\nTwo steps away from them, He lay there on the ground on bent and\r\nbroken bushes and in churned up snow.\r\n\r\nBambi half-suppressed a scream of horror, and with a sudden jump he\r\nfled, as he had already been wishing to do . He was nearly out of his\r\nsenses in terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d he heard the elder call. He looked back and saw that the elder\r\nwas calmly standing there where He was lying on the ground. Beside\r\nhimself in astonishment, Bambi stepped closer, compelled by his\r\nobedience, by his boundless curiosity, by his quaking anticipation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome closer ... don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d the elder said.\r\n\r\nThere He lay, his pale uncovered face looking upwards, His hat a\r\nlittle to the side of him in the snow, and Bambi, who knew nothing\r\nabout hats, thought that that awful head had been struck into two\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nThe hunter\xe2\x80\x99s neck was exposed and showed a wound as if it had been cut\r\nthrough. It lay open like a little red mouth. There was still a gentle\r\nflow of blood from it, blood was in His hair, under His nose, and had\r\nformed a large pool in the snow, melting it with its warmth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere we are then,\xe2\x80\x9d the elder quietly began, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re standing right\r\nbeside Him ... and where\xe2\x80\x99s the danger now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi looked down at Him as he lay there, His form, His limbs, His\r\nhair all seemed to Bambi to be something gruesome but puzzling. He\r\nlooked into those broken eyes that stared sightlessly back up at him,\r\nand he did not understand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBambi,\xe2\x80\x9d the elder continued, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you remember what Gobo said, what\r\nthe dog said, about what everyone believed ... do you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi was incapable of giving an answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can see him there, Bambi,\xe2\x80\x9d the elder went on, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can see Him\r\nlying there like any one of us. Listen to me, Bambi, He is not\r\nalmighty like they say he is. He is not the source from which\r\neverything comes, everything that grows and lives. He is not our\r\nsuperior! He is beside us, He is like us, and just like us He knows\r\nfear and need and sorrow. He can be overcome just like us and now He\r\nlies helpless on the ground, just like the rest of us, just as you see\r\nHim now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey remained silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you understand me, Bambi?\xe2\x80\x9d the elder asked.\r\n\r\nBambi answered in a whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cI think ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me what you think, then!\xe2\x80\x9d the elder ordered him.\r\n\r\nBambi blushed and quaked and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s someone else who is above\r\nall of us, ... above us and above Him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time has come, then, when I can go,\xe2\x80\x9d the elder said.\r\n\r\nHe turned round and the two of them wandered on for a little while.\r\n\r\nAt a tall ash tree the elder stopped. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t come with me any more,\r\nBambi,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, in a calm voice, \xe2\x80\x9cmy time is up. Now I need to find\r\na place for the end ...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi was about to say something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d the elder stopped him. \xe2\x80\x9cNo ... at the time I am now approaching\r\neach of us is alone. Fare well, my son ... I have loved you very\r\nmuch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe summer\xe2\x80\x99s day started being hot as soon as the sun had risen, no\r\nwind, no chill of twilight. The sun seemed to be in more of a hurry\r\nthat day. It rose quickly into the sky and broke out its dazzling\r\nflames like a dreadful blaze.\r\n\r\nThe dew on the meadow and on the bushes quickly evaporated; the earth\r\nbecame very dry and crumbly. In the woods it became quiet before its\r\nusual time. Only the woodpecker could be heard laughing here and\r\nthere, and only the pigeons cooed in tireless, fervent tenderness.\r\n\r\nDeep in a thicket there was a little, hidden clearing, giving a little\r\nfree space, and that is where Bambi was standing. Around his head a\r\nswarm of midges danced and sang in the sunshine. From the leaves of\r\nthe hazel bush beside him came a quiet buzzing, it came closer, and a\r\nbig cockchafer flew slowly past him, straight through the swarm of\r\nmidges, higher and higher up to the top of a tree where he intended to\r\nsleep until evening. His elegant wing covers stuck out from him and\r\nhis wings were bursting with power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see him ...?\xe2\x80\x9d the midges asked each other. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nelder,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of them. And the others sang, \xe2\x80\x9cAll of his relatives\r\nare already dead, but he\xe2\x80\x99s still alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA couple of very small midges asked, \xe2\x80\x9cHow long do you think he\xe2\x80\x99s going\r\nto live?\xe2\x80\x9d The others sang their answer, \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know. He\xe2\x80\x99s outlived\r\nall of his family ... he\xe2\x80\x99s very old ... very old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBambi walked on. The song of midges, he thought, song of midges ... A\r\ntender, anxious call came through to him. The voice of somebody of his\r\nown species. \xe2\x80\x9cMother! ... mother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore they understood what was happening, Bambi was standing there\r\nbefore them. Speechless, they stared at him. \xe2\x80\x9cYour mother does not\r\nhave the time now,\xe2\x80\x9d Bambi told them sternly. He looked in the little\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s eye. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you be by yourself for a while?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little one and his sister remained silent.\r\n\r\nBambi turned away, slipped into the nearest bush and disappeared, even\r\nbefore two of them could understand what had happened. He walked\r\non. \xe2\x80\x9cI like that lad ...\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll meet him again when\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s a bit bigger ...\xe2\x80\x9d He walked on. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the little lass,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nthought,\xe2\x80\x9d she\xe2\x80\x99s nice too ... that\xe2\x80\x99s what Faline looked like when she\r\nwas a child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked on and disappeared into the woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BAMBI***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 63849-0.txt or 63849-0.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/6/3/8/4/63849\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
