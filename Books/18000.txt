Many said that the doctor was\r\nthe richer man of the two, and the practice of his profession was\r\nextended over almost as wide a district. Indeed the bishop whom he\r\nwas privileged to attend, although a Roman Catholic, always spoke of\r\ntheir dioceses being conterminate. It will therefore be understood\r\nthat Dr. Finn,--Malachi Finn was his full name,--had obtained a wide\r\nreputation as a country practitioner in the west of Ireland. And he\r\nwas a man sufficiently well to do, though that boast made by his\r\nfriends, that he was as warm a man as the bishop, had but little\r\ntruth to support it. Bishops in Ireland, if they live at home, even\r\nin these days, are very warm men; and Dr. Finn had not a penny in the\r\nworld for which he had not worked hard. He had, moreover, a costly\r\nfamily, five daughters and one son, and, at the time of which we\r\nare speaking, no provision in the way of marriage or profession had\r\nbeen made for any of them. Of the one son, Phineas, the hero of the\r\nfollowing pages, the mother and five sisters were very proud. The\r\ndoctor was accustomed to say that his goose was as good as any other\r\nman\'s goose, as far as he could see as yet; but that he should like\r\nsome very strong evidence before he allowed himself to express an\r\nopinion that the young bird partook, in any degree, of the qualities\r\nof a swan. From which it may be gathered that Dr. Finn was a man of\r\ncommon-sense.\r\n\r\nPhineas had come to be a swan in the estimation of his mother and\r\nsisters by reason of certain early successes at college. His father,\r\nwhose religion was not of that bitter kind in which we in England\r\nare apt to suppose that all the Irish Roman Catholics indulge, had\r\nsent his son to Trinity; and there were some in the neighbourhood of\r\nKillaloe,--patients, probably, of Dr. Duggin, of Castle Connell, a\r\nlearned physician who had spent a fruitless life in endeavouring to\r\nmake head against Dr. Finn,--who declared that old Finn would not be\r\nsorry if his son were to turn Protestant and go in for a fellowship.\r\nMrs. Finn was a Protestant, and the five Miss Finns were Protestants,\r\nand the doctor himself was very much given to dining out among his\r\nProtestant friends on a Friday. Our Phineas, however, did not turn\r\nProtestant up in Dublin, whatever his father\'s secret wishes on that\r\nsubject may have been. He did join a debating society, to success\r\nin which his religion was no bar; and he there achieved a sort of\r\ndistinction which was both easy and pleasant, and which, making\r\nits way down to Killaloe, assisted in engendering those ideas as\r\nto swanhood of which maternal and sisterly minds are so sweetly\r\nsusceptible. "I know half a dozen old windbags at the present\r\nmoment," said the doctor, "who were great fellows at debating clubs\r\nwhen they were boys." "Phineas is not a boy any longer," said Mrs.\r\nFinn. "And windbags don\'t get college scholarships," said Matilda\r\nFinn, the second daughter. "But papa always snubs Phinny," said\r\nBarbara, the youngest. "I\'ll snub you, if you don\'t take care," said\r\nthe doctor, taking Barbara tenderly by the ear;--for his youngest\r\ndaughter was the doctor\'s pet.\r\n\r\nThe doctor certainly did not snub his son, for he allowed him to go\r\nover to London when he was twenty-two years of age, in order that he\r\nmight read with an English barrister. It was the doctor\'s wish that\r\nhis son might be called to the Irish Bar, and the young man\'s desire\r\nthat he might go to the English Bar. The doctor so far gave way,\r\nunder the influence of Phineas himself, and of all the young women of\r\nthe family, as to pay the usual fee to a very competent and learned\r\ngentleman in the Middle Temple, and to allow his son one hundred and\r\nfifty pounds per annum for three years. Dr. Finn, however, was still\r\nfirm in his intention that his son should settle in Dublin, and take\r\nthe Munster Circuit,--believing that Phineas might come to want home\r\ninfluences and home connections, in spite of the swanhood which was\r\nattributed to him.\r\n\r\nPhineas sat his terms for three years, and was duly called to\r\nthe Bar; but no evidence came home as to the acquirement of any\r\nconsiderable amount of law lore, or even as to much law study, on\r\nthe part of the young aspirant. The learned pundit at whose feet he\r\nhad been sitting was not especially loud in praise of his pupil\'s\r\nindustry, though he did say a pleasant word or two as to his pupil\'s\r\nintelligence. Phineas himself did not boast much of his own hard\r\nwork when at home during the long vacation. No rumours of expected\r\nsuccesses,--of expected professional successes,--reached the ears of\r\nany of the Finn family at Killaloe. But, nevertheless, there came\r\ntidings which maintained those high ideas in the maternal bosom of\r\nwhich mention has been made, and which were of sufficient strength to\r\ninduce the doctor, in opposition to his own judgment, to consent to\r\nthe continued residence of his son in London. Phineas belonged to an\r\nexcellent club,--the Reform Club,--and went into very good society.\r\nHe was hand in glove with the Hon. Laurence Fitzgibbon, the youngest\r\nson of Lord Claddagh. He was intimate with Barrington Erle, who had\r\nbeen private secretary,--one of the private secretaries,--to the\r\ngreat Whig Prime Minister who was lately in but was now out. He had\r\ndined three or four times with that great Whig nobleman, the Earl of\r\nBrentford. And he had been assured that if he stuck to the English\r\nBar he would certainly do well. Though he might fail to succeed in\r\ncourt or in chambers, he would doubtless have given to him some\r\none of those numerous appointments for which none but clever young\r\nbarristers are supposed to be fitting candidates. The old doctor\r\nyielded for another year, although at the end of the second year he\r\nwas called upon to pay a sum of three hundred pounds, which was then\r\ndue by Phineas to creditors in London. When the doctor\'s male friends\r\nin and about Killaloe heard that he had done so, they said that he\r\nwas doting. Not one of the Miss Finns was as yet married; and, after\r\nall that had been said about the doctor\'s wealth, it was supposed\r\nthat there would not be above five hundred pounds a year among them\r\nall, were he to give up his profession. But the doctor, when he paid\r\nthat three hundred pounds for his son, buckled to his work again,\r\nthough he had for twelve months talked of giving up the midwifery.\r\nHe buckled to again, to the great disgust of Dr. Duggin, who at this\r\ntime said very ill-natured things about young Phineas.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the three years Phineas was called to the Bar, and\r\nimmediately received a letter from his father asking minutely as to\r\nhis professional intentions. His father recommended him to settle\r\nin Dublin, and promised the one hundred and fifty pounds for three\r\nmore years, on condition that this advice was followed. He did not\r\nabsolutely say that the allowance would be stopped if the advice were\r\nnot followed, but that was plainly to be implied. That letter came\r\nat the moment of a dissolution of Parliament. Lord de Terrier, the\r\nConservative Prime Minister, who had now been in office for the\r\nalmost unprecedentedly long period of fifteen months, had found that\r\nhe could not face continued majorities against him in the House of\r\nCommons, and had dissolved the House. Rumour declared that he would\r\nhave much preferred to resign, and betake himself once again to the\r\neasy glories of opposition; but his party had naturally been obdurate\r\nwith him, and he had resolved to appeal to the country. When Phineas\r\nreceived his father\'s letter, it had just been suggested to him at\r\nthe Reform Club that he should stand for the Irish borough of\r\nLoughshane.\r\n\r\nThis proposition had taken Phineas Finn so much by surprise that when\r\nfirst made to him by Barrington Erle it took his breath away. What!\r\nhe stand for Parliament, twenty-four years old, with no vestige\r\nof property belonging to him, without a penny in his purse, as\r\ncompletely dependent on his father as he was when he first went to\r\nschool at eleven years of age! And for Loughshane, a little borough\r\nin the county Galway, for which a brother of that fine old Irish\r\npeer, the Earl of Tulla, had been sitting for the last twenty\r\nyears,--a fine, high-minded representative of the thorough-going\r\nOrange Protestant feeling of Ireland! And the Earl of Tulla, to\r\nwhom almost all Loughshane belonged,--or at any rate the land about\r\nLoughshane,--was one of his father\'s staunchest friends! Loughshane\r\nis in county Galway, but the Earl of Tulla usually lived at his seat\r\nin county Clare, not more than ten miles from Killaloe, and always\r\nconfided his gouty feet, and the weak nerves of the old countess, and\r\nthe stomachs of all his domestics, to the care of Dr. Finn. How was\r\nit possible that Phineas should stand for Loughshane? From whence\r\nwas the money to come for such a contest? It was a beautiful dream,\r\na grand idea, lifting Phineas almost off the earth by its glory.\r\nWhen the proposition was first made to him in the smoking-room at\r\nthe Reform Club by his friend Erle, he was aware that he blushed\r\nlike a girl, and that he was unable at the moment to express\r\nhimself plainly,--so great was his astonishment and so great his\r\ngratification. But before ten minutes had passed by, while Barrington\r\nErle was still sitting over his shoulder on the club sofa, and before\r\nthe blushes had altogether vanished, he had seen the improbability of\r\nthe scheme, and had explained to his friend that the thing could not\r\nbe done. But to his increased astonishment, his friend made nothing\r\nof the difficulties. Loughshane, according to Barrington Erle, was\r\nso small a place, that the expense would be very little. There were\r\naltogether no more than 307 registered electors. The inhabitants were\r\nso far removed from the world, and were so ignorant of the world\'s\r\ngood things, that they knew nothing about bribery. The Hon. George\r\nMorris, who had sat for the last twenty years, was very unpopular. He\r\nhad not been near the borough since the last election, he had hardly\r\ndone more than show himself in Parliament, and had neither given a\r\nshilling in the town nor got a place under Government for a single\r\nson of Loughshane. "And he has quarrelled with his brother," said\r\nBarrington Erle. "The devil he has!" said Phineas. "I thought they\r\nalways swore by each other." "It\'s at each other they swear now,"\r\nsaid Barrington; "George has asked the Earl for more money, and the\r\nEarl has cut up rusty." Then the negotiator went on to explain that\r\nthe expenses of the election would be defrayed out of a certain fund\r\ncollected for such purposes, that Loughshane had been chosen as a\r\ncheap place, and that Phineas Finn had been chosen as a safe and\r\npromising young man. As for qualification, if any question were\r\nraised, that should be made all right. An Irish candidate was wanted,\r\nand a Roman Catholic. So much the Loughshaners would require on\r\ntheir own account when instigated to dismiss from their service\r\nthat thorough-going Protestant, the Hon. George Morris. Then "the\r\nparty,"--by which Barrington Erle probably meant the great man in\r\nwhose service he himself had become a politician,--required that\r\nthe candidate should be a safe man, one who would support "the\r\nparty,"--not a cantankerous, red-hot semi-Fenian, running about to\r\nmeetings at the Rotunda, and such-like, with views of his own about\r\ntenant-right and the Irish Church. "But I have views of my own," said\r\nPhineas, blushing again. "Of course you have, my dear boy," said\r\nBarrington, clapping him on the back. "I shouldn\'t come to you unless\r\nyou had views. But your views and ours are the same, and you\'re\r\njust the lad for Galway. You mightn\'t have such an opening again\r\nin your life, and of course you\'ll stand for Loughshane." Then the\r\nconversation was over, the private secretary went away to arrange\r\nsome other little matter of the kind, and Phineas Finn was left alone\r\nto consider the proposition that had been made to him.\r\n\r\nTo become a member of the British Parliament! In all those hot\r\ncontests at the two debating clubs to which he had belonged, this\r\nhad been the ambition which had moved him. For, after all, to what\r\npurpose of their own had those empty debates ever tended? He and\r\nthree or four others who had called themselves Liberals had been\r\npitted against four or five who had called themselves Conservatives,\r\nand night after night they had discussed some ponderous subject\r\nwithout any idea that one would ever persuade another, or that their\r\ntalking would ever conduce to any action or to any result. But each\r\nof these combatants had felt,--without daring to announce a hope on\r\nthe subject among themselves,--that the present arena was only a\r\ntrial-ground for some possible greater amphitheatre, for some future\r\ndebating club in which debates would lead to action, and in which\r\neloquence would have power, even though persuasion might be out of\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\nPhineas certainly had never dared to speak, even to himself, of such\r\na hope. The labours of the Bar had to be encountered before the dawn\r\nof such a hope could come to him. And he had gradually learned to\r\nfeel that his prospects at the Bar were not as yet very promising. As\r\nregarded professional work he had been idle, and how then could he\r\nhave a hope?\r\n\r\nAnd now this thing, which he regarded as being of all things in the\r\nworld the most honourable, had come to him all at once, and was\r\npossibly within his reach! If he could believe Barrington Erle, he\r\nhad only to lift up his hand, and he might be in Parliament within\r\ntwo months. And who was to be believed on such a subject if not\r\nBarrington Erle? This was Erle\'s special business, and such a man\r\nwould not have come to him on such a subject had he not been in\r\nearnest, and had he not himself believed in success. There was an\r\nopening ready, an opening to this great glory,--if only it might be\r\npossible for him to fill it!\r\n\r\nWhat would his father say? His father would of course oppose the\r\nplan. And if he opposed his father, his father would of course stop\r\nhis income. And such an income as it was! Could it be that a man\r\nshould sit in Parliament and live upon a hundred and fifty pounds\r\na year? Since that payment of his debts he had become again\r\nembarrassed,--to a slight amount. He owed a tailor a trifle, and a\r\nbootmaker a trifle,--and something to the man who sold gloves and\r\nshirts; and yet he had done his best to keep out of debt with more\r\nthan Irish pertinacity, living very closely, breakfasting upon tea\r\nand a roll, and dining frequently for a shilling at a luncheon-house\r\nup a court near Lincoln\'s Inn. Where should he dine if the\r\nLoughshaners elected him to Parliament? And then he painted to\r\nhimself a not untrue picture of the probable miseries of a man who\r\nbegins life too high up on the ladder,--who succeeds in mounting\r\nbefore he has learned how to hold on when he is aloft. For our\r\nPhineas Finn was a young man not without sense,--not entirely a\r\nwindbag. If he did this thing the probability was that he might\r\nbecome utterly a castaway, and go entirely to the dogs before he was\r\nthirty. He had heard of penniless men who had got into Parliament,\r\nand to whom had come such a fate. He was able to name to himself a\r\nman or two whose barks, carrying more sail than they could bear, had\r\ngone to pieces among early breakers in this way. But then, would\r\nit not be better to go to pieces early than never to carry any\r\nsail at all? And there was, at any rate, the chance of success. He\r\nwas already a barrister, and there were so many things open to a\r\nbarrister with a seat in Parliament! And as he knew of men who had\r\nbeen utterly ruined by such early mounting, so also did he know of\r\nothers whose fortunes had been made by happy audacity when they were\r\nyoung. He almost thought that he could die happy if he had once taken\r\nhis seat in Parliament,--if he had received one letter with those\r\ngrand initials written after his name on the address. Young men in\r\nbattle are called upon to lead forlorn hopes. Three fall, perhaps,\r\nto one who gets through; but the one who gets through will have\r\nthe Victoria Cross to carry for the rest of his life. This was his\r\nforlorn hope; and as he had been invited to undertake the work, he\r\nwould not turn from the danger. On the following morning he again saw\r\nBarrington Erle by appointment, and then wrote the following letter\r\nto his father:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Reform Club, Feb., 186--.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR FATHER,\r\n\r\n   I am afraid that the purport of this letter will startle\r\n   you, but I hope that when you have finished it you will\r\n   think that I am right in my decision as to what I am going\r\n   to do. You are no doubt aware that the dissolution of\r\n   Parliament will take place at once, and that we shall be\r\n   in all the turmoil of a general election by the middle of\r\n   March. I have been invited to stand for Loughshane, and\r\n   have consented. The proposition has been made to me by my\r\n   friend Barrington Erle, Mr. Mildmay\'s private secretary,\r\n   and has been made on behalf of the Political Committee of\r\n   the Reform Club. I need hardly say that I should not have\r\n   thought of such a thing with a less thorough promise of\r\n   support than this gives me, nor should I think of it now\r\n   had I not been assured that none of the expense of the\r\n   election would fall upon me. Of course I could not have\r\n   asked you to pay for it.\r\n\r\n   But to such a proposition, so made, I have felt that it\r\n   would be cowardly to give a refusal. I cannot but regard\r\n   such a selection as a great honour. I own that I am fond\r\n   of politics, and have taken great delight in their study\r\n   --("Stupid young fool!" his father said to himself as he\r\n   read this)--and it has been my dream for years past to\r\n   have a seat in Parliament at some future time. ("Dream!\r\n   yes; I wonder whether he has ever dreamed what he is to\r\n   live upon.") The chance has now come to me much earlier\r\n   than I have looked for it, but I do not think that it\r\n   should on that account be thrown away. Looking to my\r\n   profession, I find that many things are open to a\r\n   barrister with a seat in Parliament, and that the House\r\n   need not interfere much with a man\'s practice. ("Not if\r\n   he has got to the top of his tree," said the doctor.)\r\n\r\n   My chief doubt arose from the fact of your old friendship\r\n   with Lord Tulla, whose brother has filled the seat for I\r\n   don\'t know how many years. But it seems that George Morris\r\n   must go; or, at least, that he must be opposed by a\r\n   Liberal candidate. If I do not stand, some one else will,\r\n   and I should think that Lord Tulla will be too much of a\r\n   man to make any personal quarrel on such a subject. If he\r\n   is to lose the borough, why should not I have it as well\r\n   as another?\r\n\r\n   I can fancy, my dear father, all that you will say as to\r\n   my imprudence, and I quite confess that I have not a word\r\n   to answer. I have told myself more than once, since last\r\n   night, that I shall probably ruin myself. ("I wonder\r\n   whether he has ever told himself that he will probably\r\n   ruin me also," said the doctor.) But I am prepared to ruin\r\n   myself in such a cause. I have no one dependent on me;\r\n   and, as long as I do nothing to disgrace my name, I may\r\n   dispose of myself as I please. If you decide on stopping\r\n   my allowance, I shall have no feeling of anger against\r\n   you. ("How very considerate!" said the doctor.) And in\r\n   that case I shall endeavour to support myself by my pen.\r\n   I have already done a little for the magazines.\r\n\r\n   Give my best love to my mother and sisters. If you will\r\n   receive me during the time of the election, I shall see\r\n   them soon. Perhaps it will be best for me to say that I\r\n   have positively decided on making the attempt; that is to\r\n   say, if the Club Committee is as good as its promise. I\r\n   have weighed the matter all round, and I regard the prize\r\n   as being so great, that I am prepared to run any risk to\r\n   obtain it. Indeed, to me, with my views about politics,\r\n   the running of such a risk is no more than a duty. I\r\n   cannot keep my hand from the work now that the work has\r\n   come in the way of my hand. I shall be most anxious to get\r\n   a line from you in answer to this.\r\n\r\n   Your most affectionate son,\r\n\r\n   PHINEAS FINN.\r\n\r\n\r\nI question whether Dr. Finn, when he read this letter, did not feel\r\nmore of pride than of anger,--whether he was not rather gratified\r\nthan displeased, in spite of all that his common-sense told him on\r\nthe subject. His wife and daughters, when they heard the news, were\r\nclearly on the side of the young man. Mrs. Finn immediately expressed\r\nan opinion that Parliament would be the making of her son, and that\r\neverybody would be sure to employ so distinguished a barrister. The\r\ngirls declared that Phineas ought, at any rate, to have his chance,\r\nand almost asserted that it would be brutal in their father to stand\r\nin their brother\'s way. It was in vain that the doctor tried to\r\nexplain that going into Parliament could not help a young barrister,\r\nwhatever it might do for one thoroughly established in his\r\nprofession; that Phineas, if successful at Loughshane, would at once\r\nabandon all idea of earning any income,--that the proposition, coming\r\nfrom so poor a man, was a monstrosity,--that such an opposition\r\nto the Morris family, coming from a son of his, would be gross\r\ningratitude to Lord Tulla. Mrs. Finn and the girls talked him down,\r\nand the doctor himself was almost carried away by something like\r\nvanity in regard to his son\'s future position.\r\n\r\nNevertheless he wrote a letter strongly advising Phineas to abandon\r\nthe project. But he himself was aware that the letter which he wrote\r\nwas not one from which any success could be expected. He advised\r\nhis son, but did not command him. He made no threats as to stopping\r\nhis income. He did not tell Phineas, in so many words, that he was\r\nproposing to make an ass of himself. He argued very prudently against\r\nthe plan, and Phineas, when he received his father\'s letter, of\r\ncourse felt that it was tantamount to a paternal permission to\r\nproceed with the matter. On the next day he got a letter from his\r\nmother full of affection, full of pride,--not exactly telling him to\r\nstand for Loughshane by all means, for Mrs. Finn was not the woman to\r\nrun openly counter to her husband in any advice given by her to their\r\nson,--but giving him every encouragement which motherly affection and\r\nmotherly pride could bestow. "Of course you will come to us," she\r\nsaid, "if you do make up your mind to be member for Loughshane. We\r\nshall all of us be so delighted to have you!" Phineas, who had fallen\r\ninto a sea of doubt after writing to his father, and who had demanded\r\na week from Barrington Erle to consider the matter, was elated to\r\npositive certainty by the joint effect of the two letters from home.\r\nHe understood it all. His mother and sisters were altogether in\r\nfavour of his audacity, and even his father was not disposed to\r\nquarrel with him on the subject.\r\n\r\n"I shall take you at your word," he said to Barrington Erle at the\r\nclub that evening.\r\n\r\n"What word?" said Erle, who had too many irons in the fire to be\r\nthinking always of Loughshane and Phineas Finn,--or who at any rate\r\ndid not choose to let his anxiety on the subject be seen.\r\n\r\n"About Loughshane."\r\n\r\n"All right, old fellow; we shall be sure to carry you through. The\r\nIrish writs will be out on the third of March, and the sooner you\'re\r\nthere the better."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nPhineas Finn Is Elected for Loughshane\r\n\r\n\r\nOne great difficulty about the borough vanished in a very wonderful\r\nway at the first touch. Dr. Finn, who was a man stout at heart,\r\nand by no means afraid of his great friends, drove himself over to\r\nCastlemorris to tell his news to the Earl, as soon as he got a second\r\nletter from his son declaring his intention of proceeding with the\r\nbusiness, let the results be what they might. Lord Tulla was a\r\npassionate old man, and the doctor expected that there would be a\r\nquarrel;--but he was prepared to face that. He was under no special\r\ndebt of gratitude to the lord, having given as much as he had taken\r\nin the long intercourse which had existed between them;--and he\r\nagreed with his son in thinking that if there was to be a Liberal\r\ncandidate at Loughshane, no consideration of old pill-boxes and\r\ngallipots should deter his son Phineas from standing. Other\r\nconsiderations might very probably deter him, but not that. The Earl\r\nprobably would be of a different opinion, and the doctor felt it to\r\nbe incumbent on him to break the news to Lord Tulla.\r\n\r\n"The devil he is!" said the Earl, when the doctor had told his story.\r\n"Then I\'ll tell you what, Finn, I\'ll support him."\r\n\r\n"You support him, Lord Tulla!"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--why shouldn\'t I support him? I suppose it\'s not so bad with me\r\nin the country that my support will rob him of his chance! I\'ll tell\r\nyou one thing for certain, I won\'t support George Morris."\r\n\r\n"But, my lord--"\r\n\r\n"Well; go on."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve never taken much part in politics myself, as you know; but my\r\nboy Phineas is on the other side."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care a ---- for sides. What has my party done for me?\r\nLook at my cousin, Dick Morris. There\'s not a clergyman in Ireland\r\nstauncher to them than he has been, and now they\'ve given the deanery\r\nof Kilfenora to a man that never had a father, though I condescended\r\nto ask for it for my cousin. Let them wait till I ask for anything\r\nagain." Dr. Finn, who knew all about Dick Morris\'s debts, and who had\r\nheard of his modes of preaching, was not surprised at the decision\r\nof the Conservative bestower of Irish Church patronage; but on this\r\nsubject he said nothing. "And as for George," continued the Earl, "I\r\nwill never lift my hand again for him. His standing for Loughshane\r\nwould be quite out of the question. My own tenants wouldn\'t vote for\r\nhim if I were to ask them myself. Peter Blake"--Mr. Peter Blake was\r\nthe lord\'s agent--"told me only a week ago that it would be useless.\r\nThe whole thing is gone, and for my part I wish they\'d disenfranchise\r\nthe borough. I wish they\'d disenfranchise the whole country, and send\r\nus a military governor. What\'s the use of such members as we send?\r\nThere isn\'t one gentleman among ten of them. Your son is welcome for\r\nme. What support I can give him he shall have, but it isn\'t much. I\r\nsuppose he had better come and see me."\r\n\r\nThe doctor promised that his son should ride over to Castlemorris,\r\nand then took his leave,--not specially flattered, as he felt that\r\nwere his son to be returned, the Earl would not regard him as the\r\none gentleman among ten whom the county might send to leaven the\r\nremainder of its members,--but aware that the greatest impediment\r\nin his son\'s way was already removed. He certainly had not gone to\r\nCastlemorris with any idea of canvassing for his son, and yet he had\r\ncanvassed for him most satisfactorily. When he got home he did not\r\nknow how to speak of the matter otherwise than triumphantly to his\r\nwife and daughters. Though he desired to curse, his mouth would speak\r\nblessings. Before that evening was over the prospects of Phineas at\r\nLoughshane were spoken of with open enthusiasm before the doctor,\r\nand by the next day\'s post a letter was written to him by Matilda,\r\ninforming him that the Earl was prepared to receive him with open\r\narms. "Papa has been over there and managed it all," said Matilda.\r\n\r\n"I\'m told George Morris isn\'t going to stand," said Barrington Erle\r\nto Phineas the night before his departure.\r\n\r\n"His brother won\'t support him. His brother means to support me,"\r\nsaid Phineas.\r\n\r\n"That can hardly be so."\r\n\r\n"But I tell you it is. My father has known the Earl these twenty\r\nyears, and has managed it."\r\n\r\n"I say, Finn, you\'re not going to play us a trick, are you?" said Mr.\r\nErle, with something like dismay in his voice.\r\n\r\n"What sort of trick?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re not coming out on the other side?"\r\n\r\n"Not if I know it," said Phineas, proudly. "Let me assure you I\r\nwouldn\'t change my views in politics either for you or for the Earl,\r\nthough each of you carried seats in your breeches pockets. If I go\r\ninto Parliament, I shall go there as a sound Liberal,--not to support\r\na party, but to do the best I can for the country. I tell you so, and\r\nI shall tell the Earl the same."\r\n\r\nBarrington Erle turned away in disgust. Such language was to him\r\nsimply disgusting. It fell upon his ears as false maudlin sentiment\r\nfalls on the ears of the ordinary honest man of the world. Barrington\r\nErle was a man ordinarily honest. He would not have been untrue to\r\nhis mother\'s brother, William Mildmay, the great Whig Minister of the\r\nday, for any earthly consideration. He was ready to work with wages\r\nor without wages. He was really zealous in the cause, not asking\r\nvery much for himself. He had some undefined belief that it was much\r\nbetter for the country that Mr. Mildmay should be in power than\r\nthat Lord de Terrier should be there. He was convinced that Liberal\r\npolitics were good for Englishmen, and that Liberal politics and the\r\nMildmay party were one and the same thing. It would be unfair to\r\nBarrington Erle to deny to him some praise for patriotism. But he\r\nhated the very name of independence in Parliament, and when he was\r\ntold of any man, that that man intended to look to measures and not\r\nto men, he regarded that man as being both unstable as water and\r\ndishonest as the wind. No good could possibly come from such a one,\r\nand much evil might and probably would come. Such a politician was a\r\nGreek to Barrington Erle, from whose hands he feared to accept even\r\nthe gift of a vote. Parliamentary hermits were distasteful to him,\r\nand dwellers in political caves were regarded by him with aversion\r\nas being either knavish or impractical. With a good Conservative\r\nopponent he could shake hands almost as readily as with a good Whig\r\nally; but the man who was neither flesh nor fowl was odious to him.\r\nAccording to his theory of parliamentary government, the House of\r\nCommons should be divided by a marked line, and every member should\r\nbe required to stand on one side of it or on the other. "If not\r\nwith me, at any rate be against me," he would have said to every\r\nrepresentative of the people in the name of the great leader whom he\r\nfollowed. He thought that debates were good, because of the people\r\noutside,--because they served to create that public opinion which was\r\nhereafter to be used in creating some future House of Commons; but he\r\ndid not think it possible that any vote should be given on a great\r\nquestion, either this way or that, as the result of a debate; and he\r\nwas certainly assured in his own opinion that any such changing of\r\nvotes would be dangerous, revolutionary, and almost unparliamentary.\r\nA member\'s vote,--except on some small crotchety open question thrown\r\nout for the amusement of crotchety members,--was due to the leader of\r\nthat member\'s party. Such was Mr. Erle\'s idea of the English system\r\nof Parliament, and, lending semi-official assistance as he did\r\nfrequently to the introduction of candidates into the House, he was\r\nnaturally anxious that his candidates should be candidates after his\r\nown heart. When, therefore, Phineas Finn talked of measures and not\r\nmen, Barrington Erle turned away in open disgust. But he remembered\r\nthe youth and extreme rawness of the lad, and he remembered also the\r\ncareers of other men.\r\n\r\nBarrington Erle was forty, and experience had taught him something.\r\nAfter a few seconds, he brought himself to think mildly of the young\r\nman\'s vanity,--as of the vanity of a plunging colt who resents the\r\nliberty even of a touch. "By the end of the first session the thong\r\nwill be cracked over his head, as he patiently assists in pulling the\r\ncoach up hill, without producing from him even a flick of his tail,"\r\nsaid Barrington Erle to an old parliamentary friend.\r\n\r\n"If he were to come out after all on the wrong side," said the\r\nparliamentary friend.\r\n\r\nErle admitted that such a trick as that would be unpleasant, but\r\nhe thought that old Lord Tulla was hardly equal to so clever a\r\nstratagem.\r\n\r\nPhineas went to Ireland, and walked over the course at Loughshane.\r\nHe called upon Lord Tulla, and heard that venerable nobleman talk a\r\ngreat deal of nonsense. To tell the truth of Phineas, I must confess\r\nthat he wished to talk the nonsense himself; but the Earl would not\r\nhear him, and put him down very quickly. "We won\'t discuss politics,\r\nif you please, Mr. Finn; because, as I have already said, I am\r\nthrowing aside all political considerations." Phineas, therefore, was\r\nnot allowed to express his views on the government of the country in\r\nthe Earl\'s sitting-room at Castlemorris. There was, however, a good\r\ntime coming; and so, for the present, he allowed the Earl to ramble\r\non about the sins of his brother George, and the want of all proper\r\npedigree on the part of the new Dean of Kilfenora. The conference\r\nended with an assurance on the part of Lord Tulla that if the\r\nLoughshaners chose to elect Mr. Phineas Finn he would not be in the\r\nleast offended. The electors did elect Mr. Phineas Finn,--perhaps\r\nfor the reason given by one of the Dublin Conservative papers, which\r\ndeclared that it was all the fault of the Carlton Club in not sending\r\na proper candidate. There was a great deal said about the matter,\r\nboth in London and Dublin, and the blame was supposed to fall on\r\nthe joint shoulders of George Morris and his elder brother. In the\r\nmeantime, our hero, Phineas Finn, had been duly elected member of\r\nParliament for the borough of Loughshane.\r\n\r\nThe Finn family could not restrain their triumphings at Killaloe, and\r\nI do not know that it would have been natural had they done so. A\r\ngosling from such a flock does become something of a real swan by\r\ngetting into Parliament. The doctor had his misgivings,--had great\r\nmisgivings, fearful forebodings; but there was the young man elected,\r\nand he could not help it. He could not refuse his right hand to his\r\nson or withdraw his paternal assistance because that son had been\r\nspecially honoured among the young men of his country. So he pulled\r\nout of his hoard what sufficed to pay off outstanding debts,--they\r\nwere not heavy,--and undertook to allow Phineas two hundred and fifty\r\npounds a year as long as the session should last.\r\n\r\nThere was a widow lady living at Killaloe who was named Mrs. Flood\r\nJones, and she had a daughter. She had a son also, born to inherit\r\nthe property of the late Floscabel Flood Jones of Floodborough, as\r\nsoon as that property should have disembarrassed itself; but with\r\nhim, now serving with his regiment in India, we shall have no\r\nconcern. Mrs. Flood Jones was living modestly at Killaloe on her\r\nwidow\'s jointure,--Floodborough having, to tell the truth, pretty\r\nnearly fallen into absolute ruin,--and with her one daughter, Mary.\r\nNow on the evening before the return of Phineas Finn, Esq., M.P., to\r\nLondon, Mrs. and Miss Flood Jones drank tea at the doctor\'s house.\r\n\r\n"It won\'t make a bit of change in him," Barbara Finn said to her\r\nfriend Mary, up in some bedroom privacy before the tea-drinking\r\nceremonies had altogether commenced.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it must," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"I tell you it won\'t, my dear; he is so good and so true."\r\n\r\n"I know he is good, Barbara; and as for truth, there is no question\r\nabout it, because he has never said a word to me that he might not\r\nsay to any girl."\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense, Mary."\r\n\r\n"He never has, then, as sure as the blessed Virgin watches over\r\nus;--only you don\'t believe she does."\r\n\r\n"Never mind about the Virgin now, Mary."\r\n\r\n"But he never has. Your brother is nothing to me, Barbara."\r\n\r\n"Then I hope he will be before the evening is over. He was walking\r\nwith you all yesterday and the day before."\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t he,--and we that have known each other all our lives?\r\nBut, Barbara, pray, pray never say a word of this to any one!"\r\n\r\n"Is it I? Wouldn\'t I cut out my tongue first?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why I let you talk to me in this way. There has never\r\nbeen anything between me and Phineas,--your brother I mean."\r\n\r\n"I know whom you mean very well."\r\n\r\n"And I feel quite sure that there never will be. Why should there?\r\nHe\'ll go out among great people and be a great man; and I\'ve already\r\nfound out that there\'s a certain Lady Laura Standish whom he admires\r\nvery much."\r\n\r\n"Lady Laura Fiddlestick!"\r\n\r\n"A man in Parliament, you know, may look up to anybody," said Miss\r\nMary Flood Jones.\r\n\r\n"I want Phin to look up to you, my dear."\r\n\r\n"That wouldn\'t be looking up. Placed as he is now, that would be\r\nlooking down; and he is so proud that he\'ll never do that. But come\r\ndown, dear, else they\'ll wonder where we are."\r\n\r\nMary Flood Jones was a little girl about twenty years of age, with\r\nthe softest hair in the world, of a colour varying between brown and\r\nauburn,--for sometimes you would swear it was the one and sometimes\r\nthe other; and she was as pretty as ever she could be. She was one\r\nof those girls, so common in Ireland, whom men, with tastes that way\r\ngiven, feel inclined to take up and devour on the spur of the moment;\r\nand when she liked her lion, she had a look about her which seemed to\r\nask to be devoured. There are girls so cold-looking,--pretty girls,\r\ntoo, ladylike, discreet, and armed with all accomplishments,--whom to\r\nattack seems to require the same sort of courage, and the same sort\r\nof preparation, as a journey in quest of the north-west passage. One\r\nthinks of a pedestal near the Athenaeum as the most appropriate and\r\nmost honourable reward of such courage. But, again, there are other\r\ngirls to abstain from attacking whom is, to a man of any warmth\r\nof temperament, quite impossible. They are like water when one is\r\nathirst, like plovers\' eggs in March, like cigars when one is out\r\nin the autumn. No one ever dreams of denying himself when such\r\ntemptation comes in the way. It often happens, however, that in spite\r\nof appearances, the water will not come from the well, nor the egg\r\nfrom its shell, nor will the cigar allow itself to be lit. A girl of\r\nsuch appearance, so charming, was Mary Flood Jones of Killaloe, and\r\nour hero Phineas was not allowed to thirst in vain for a drop from\r\nthe cool spring.\r\n\r\nWhen the girls went down into the drawing-room Mary was careful to\r\ngo to a part of the room quite remote from Phineas, so as to seat\r\nherself between Mrs. Finn and Dr. Finn\'s young partner, Mr. Elias\r\nBodkin, from Ballinasloe. But Mrs. Finn and the Miss Finns and all\r\nKillaloe knew that Mary had no love for Mr. Bodkin, and when Mr.\r\nBodkin handed her the hot cake she hardly so much as smiled at him.\r\nBut in two minutes Phineas was behind her chair, and then she smiled;\r\nand in five minutes more she had got herself so twisted round that\r\nshe was sitting in a corner with Phineas and his sister Barbara; and\r\nin two more minutes Barbara had returned to Mr. Elias Bodkin, so that\r\nPhineas and Mary were uninterrupted. They manage these things very\r\nquickly and very cleverly in Killaloe.\r\n\r\n"I shall be off to-morrow morning by the early train," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"So soon;--and when will you have to begin,--in Parliament, I mean?"\r\n\r\n"I shall have to take my seat on Friday. I\'m going back just in\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"But when shall we hear of your saying something?"\r\n\r\n"Never, probably. Not one in ten who go into Parliament ever do say\r\nanything."\r\n\r\n"But you will; won\'t you? I hope you will. I do so hope you will\r\ndistinguish yourself;--because of your sister, and for the sake of\r\nthe town, you know."\r\n\r\n"And is that all, Mary?"\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t that enough?"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t care a bit about myself, then?"\r\n\r\n"You know that I do. Haven\'t we been friends ever since we were\r\nchildren? Of course it will be a great pride to me that a person whom\r\nI have known so intimately should come to be talked about as a great\r\nman."\r\n\r\n"I shall never be talked about as a great man."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a great man to me already, being in Parliament. Only\r\nthink;--I never saw a member of Parliament in my life before."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve seen the bishop scores of times."\r\n\r\n"Is he in Parliament? Ah, but not like you. He couldn\'t come to be\r\na Cabinet Minister, and one never reads anything about him in the\r\nnewspapers. I shall expect to see your name, very often, and I shall\r\nalways look for it. \'Mr. Phineas Finn paired off with Mr. Mildmay.\'\r\nWhat is the meaning of pairing off?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll explain it all to you when I come back, after learning my\r\nlesson."\r\n\r\n"Mind you do come back. But I don\'t suppose you ever will. You will\r\nbe going somewhere to see Lady Laura Standish when you are not wanted\r\nin Parliament."\r\n\r\n"Lady Laura Standish!"\r\n\r\n"And why shouldn\'t you? Of course, with your prospects, you should\r\ngo as much as possible among people of that sort. Is Lady Laura very\r\npretty?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s about six feet high."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense. I don\'t believe that."\r\n\r\n"She would look as though she were, standing by you."\r\n\r\n"Because I am so insignificant and small."\r\n\r\n"Because your figure is perfect, and because she is straggling. She\r\nis as unlike you as possible in everything. She has thick lumpy red\r\nhair, while yours is all silk and softness. She has large hands and\r\nfeet, and--"\r\n\r\n"Why, Phineas, you are making her out to be an ogress, and yet I know\r\nthat you admire her."\r\n\r\n"So I do, because she possesses such an appearance of power. And\r\nafter all, in spite of the lumpy hair, and in spite of large hands\r\nand straggling figure, she is handsome. One can\'t tell what it is.\r\nOne can see that she is quite contented with herself, and intends to\r\nmake others contented with her. And so she does."\r\n\r\n"I see you are in love with her, Phineas."\r\n\r\n"No; not in love,--not with her at least. Of all men in the world, I\r\nsuppose that I am the last that has a right to be in love. I daresay\r\nI shall marry some day."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I hope you will."\r\n\r\n"But not till I\'m forty or perhaps fifty years old. If I was not fool\r\nenough to have what men call a high ambition I might venture to be in\r\nlove now."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I\'m very glad that you\'ve got a high ambition. It is what\r\nevery man ought to have; and I\'ve no doubt that we shall hear of your\r\nmarriage soon,--very soon. And then,--if she can help you in your\r\nambition, we--shall--all--be so--glad."\r\n\r\nPhineas did not say a word further then. Perhaps some commotion among\r\nthe party broke up the little private conversation in the corner. And\r\nhe was not alone with Mary again till there came a moment for him\r\nto put her cloak over her shoulders in the back parlour, while Mrs.\r\nFlood Jones was finishing some important narrative to his mother. It\r\nwas Barbara, I think, who stood in some doorway, and prevented people\r\nfrom passing, and so gave him the opportunity which he abused.\r\n\r\n"Mary," said he, taking her in his arms, without a single word of\r\nlove-making beyond what the reader has heard,--"one kiss before we\r\npart."\r\n\r\n"No, Phineas, no!" But the kiss had been taken and given before she\r\nhad even answered him. "Oh, Phineas, you shouldn\'t!"\r\n\r\n"I should. Why shouldn\'t I? And, Mary, I will have one morsel of your\r\nhair."\r\n\r\n"You shall not; indeed you shall not!" But the scissors were at hand,\r\nand the ringlet was cut and in his pocket before she was ready with\r\nher resistance. There was nothing further;--not a word more, and Mary\r\nwent away with her veil down, under her mother\'s wing, weeping sweet\r\nsilent tears which no one saw.\r\n\r\n"You do love her; don\'t you, Phineas?" asked Barbara.\r\n\r\n"Bother! Do you go to bed, and don\'t trouble yourself about such\r\ntrifles. But mind you\'re up, old girl, to see me off in the morning."\r\n\r\nEverybody was up to see him off in the morning, to give him coffee\r\nand good advice, and kisses, and to throw all manner of old shoes\r\nafter him as he started on his great expedition to Parliament. His\r\nfather gave him an extra twenty-pound note, and begged him for God\'s\r\nsake to be careful about his money. His mother told him always to\r\nhave an orange in his pocket when he intended to speak longer than\r\nusual. And Barbara in a last whisper begged him never to forget dear\r\nMary Flood Jones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPhineas Finn Takes His Seat\r\n\r\n\r\nPhineas had many serious, almost solemn thoughts on his journey\r\ntowards London. I am sorry I must assure my female readers that very\r\nfew of them had reference to Mary Flood Jones. He had, however, very\r\ncarefully packed up the tress, and could bring that out for proper\r\nacts of erotic worship at seasons in which his mind might be less\r\nengaged with affairs of state than it was at present. Would he make a\r\nfailure of this great matter which he had taken in hand? He could not\r\nbut tell himself that the chances were twenty to one against him. Now\r\nthat he looked nearer at it all, the difficulties loomed larger than\r\never, and the rewards seemed to be less, more difficult of approach,\r\nand more evanescent. How many members were there who could never get\r\na hearing! How many who only spoke to fail! How many, who spoke well,\r\nwho could speak to no effect as far as their own worldly prospects\r\nwere concerned! He had already known many members of Parliament to\r\nwhom no outward respect or sign of honour was ever given by any one;\r\nand it seemed to him, as he thought over it, that Irish members of\r\nParliament were generally treated with more indifference than any\r\nothers. There were O\'B---- and O\'C---- and O\'D----, for whom no one\r\ncared a straw, who could hardly get men to dine with them at the\r\nclub, and yet they were genuine members of Parliament. Why should he\r\never be better than O\'B----, or O\'C----, or O\'D----? And in what way\r\nshould he begin to be better? He had an idea of the fashion after\r\nwhich it would be his duty to strive that he might excel those\r\ngentlemen. He did not give any of them credit for much earnestness\r\nin their country\'s behalf, and he was minded to be very earnest. He\r\nwould go to his work honestly and conscientiously, determined to do\r\nhis duty as best he might, let the results to himself be what they\r\nwould. This was a noble resolution, and might have been pleasant to\r\nhim,--had he not remembered that smile of derision which had come\r\nover his friend Erle\'s face when he declared his intention of doing\r\nhis duty to his country as a Liberal, and not of supporting a party.\r\nO\'B---- and O\'C---- and O\'D---- were keen enough to support their\r\nparty, only they were sometimes a little astray at knowing which\r\nwas their party for the nonce. He knew that Erle and such men would\r\ndespise him if he did not fall into the regular groove,--and if the\r\nBarrington Erles despised him, what would then be left for him?\r\n\r\nHis moody thoughts were somewhat dissipated when he found one\r\nLaurence Fitzgibbon,--the Honourable Laurence Fitzgibbon,--a special\r\nfriend of his own, and a very clever fellow, on board the boat as it\r\nsteamed out of Kingston harbour. Laurence Fitzgibbon had also just\r\nbeen over about his election, and had been returned as a matter of\r\ncourse for his father\'s county. Laurence Fitzgibbon had sat in the\r\nHouse for the last fifteen years, and was yet well-nigh as young a\r\nman as any in it. And he was a man altogether different from the\r\nO\'B----s, O\'C----s, and O\'D----s. Laurence Fitzgibbon could always\r\nget the ear of the House if he chose to speak, and his friends\r\ndeclared that he might have been high up in office long since if he\r\nwould have taken the trouble to work. He was a welcome guest at the\r\nhouses of the very best people, and was a friend of whom any one\r\nmight be proud. It had for two years been a feather in the cap of\r\nPhineas that he knew Laurence Fitzgibbon. And yet people said that\r\nLaurence Fitzgibbon had nothing of his own, and men wondered how he\r\nlived. He was the youngest son of Lord Claddagh, an Irish peer with a\r\nlarge family, who could do nothing for Laurence, his favourite child,\r\nbeyond finding him a seat in Parliament.\r\n\r\n"Well, Finn, my boy," said Laurence, shaking hands with the young\r\nmember on board the steamer, "so you\'ve made it all right at\r\nLoughshane." Then Phineas was beginning to tell all the story,\r\nthe wonderful story, of George Morris and the Earl of Tulla,--how\r\nthe men of Loughshane had elected him without opposition; how he\r\nhad been supported by Conservatives as well as Liberals;--how\r\nunanimous Loughshane had been in electing him, Phineas Finn, as its\r\nrepresentative. But Mr. Fitzgibbon seemed to care very little about\r\nall this, and went so far as to declare that those things were\r\naccidents which fell out sometimes one way and sometimes another,\r\nand were altogether independent of any merit or demerit on the part\r\nof the candidate himself. And it was marvellous and almost painful\r\nto Phineas that his friend Fitzgibbon should accept the fact of his\r\nmembership with so little of congratulation,--with absolutely no\r\nblowing of trumpets whatever. Had he been elected a member of the\r\nmunicipal corporation of Loughshane, instead of its representative in\r\nthe British Parliament, Laurence Fitzgibbon could not have made less\r\nfuss about it. Phineas was disappointed, but he took the cue from his\r\nfriend too quickly to show his disappointment. And when, half an hour\r\nafter their meeting, Fitzgibbon had to be reminded that his companion\r\nwas not in the House during the last session, Phineas was able to\r\nmake the remark as though he thought as little about the House as did\r\nthe old-accustomed member himself.\r\n\r\n"As far as I can see as yet," said Fitzgibbon, "we are sure to have\r\nseventeen."\r\n\r\n"Seventeen?" said Phineas, not quite understanding the meaning of the\r\nnumber quoted.\r\n\r\n"A majority of seventeen. There are four Irish counties and three\r\nScotch which haven\'t returned as yet; but we know pretty well what\r\nthey\'ll do. There\'s a doubt about Tipperary, of course, but whichever\r\ngets in of the seven who are standing, it will be a vote on our side.\r\nNow the Government can\'t live against that. The uphill strain is too\r\nmuch for them."\r\n\r\n"According to my idea, nothing can justify them in trying to live\r\nagainst a majority."\r\n\r\n"That\'s gammon. When the thing is so equal, anything is fair. But you\r\nsee they don\'t like it. Of course there are some among them as hungry\r\nas we are; and Dubby would give his toes and fingers to remain in."\r\nDubby was the ordinary name by which, among friends and foes, Mr.\r\nDaubeny was known: Mr. Daubeny, who at that time was the leader of\r\nthe Conservative party in the House of Commons. "But most of them,"\r\ncontinued Mr. Fitzgibbon, "prefer the other game, and if you don\'t\r\ncare about money, upon my word it\'s the pleasanter game of the two."\r\n\r\n"But the country gets nothing done by a Tory Government."\r\n\r\n"As to that, it\'s six of one and half a dozen of the other. I never\r\nknew a government yet that wanted to do anything. Give a government\r\na real strong majority, as the Tories used to have half a century\r\nsince, and as a matter of course it will do nothing. Why should\r\nit? Doing things, as you call it, is only bidding for power,--for\r\npatronage and pay."\r\n\r\n"And is the country to have no service done?"\r\n\r\n"The country gets quite as much service as it pays for,--and perhaps\r\na little more. The clerks in the offices work for the country. And\r\nthe Ministers work too, if they\'ve got anything to manage. There is\r\nplenty of work done;--but of work in Parliament, the less the better,\r\naccording to my ideas. It\'s very little that ever is done, and that\r\nlittle is generally too much."\r\n\r\n"But the people--"\r\n\r\n"Come down and have a glass of brandy-and-water, and leave the people\r\nalone for the present. The people can take care of themselves a great\r\ndeal better than we can take care of them." Mr. Fitzgibbon\'s doctrine\r\nas to the commonwealth was very different from that of Barrington\r\nErle, and was still less to the taste of the new member. Barrington\r\nErle considered that his leader, Mr. Mildmay, should be intrusted to\r\nmake all necessary changes in the laws, and that an obedient House of\r\nCommons should implicitly obey that leader in authorising all changes\r\nproposed by him;--but according to Barrington Erle, such changes\r\nshould be numerous and of great importance, and would, if duly passed\r\ninto law at his lord\'s behest, gradually produce such a Whig Utopia\r\nin England as has never yet been seen on the face of the earth.\r\nNow, according to Mr. Fitzgibbon, the present Utopia would be good\r\nenough,--if only he himself might be once more put into possession\r\nof a certain semi-political place about the Court, from which he had\r\nheretofore drawn L1,000 per annum, without any work, much to his\r\ncomfort. He made no secret of his ambition, and was chagrined simply\r\nat the prospect of having to return to his electors before he could\r\nenjoy those good things which he expected to receive from the\r\nundoubted majority of seventeen, which had been, or would be,\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\n"I hate all change as a rule," said Fitzgibbon; "but, upon my word,\r\nwe ought to alter that. When a fellow has got a crumb of comfort,\r\nafter waiting for it years and years, and perhaps spending thousands\r\nin elections, he has to go back and try his hand again at the last\r\nmoment, merely in obedience to some antiquated prejudice. Look at\r\npoor Jack Bond,--the best friend I ever had in the world. He was\r\nwrecked upon that rock for ever. He spent every shilling he had in\r\ncontesting Romford three times running,--and three times running\r\nhe got in. Then they made him Vice-Comptroller of the Granaries,\r\nand I\'m shot if he didn\'t get spilt at Romford on standing for his\r\nre-election!"\r\n\r\n"And what became of him?"\r\n\r\n"God knows. I think I heard that he married an old woman and settled\r\ndown somewhere. I know he never came up again. Now, I call that a\r\nconfounded shame. I suppose I\'m safe down in Mayo, but there\'s no\r\nknowing what may happen in these days."\r\n\r\nAs they parted at Euston Square, Phineas asked his friend some little\r\nnervous question as to the best mode of making a first entrance into\r\nthe House. Would Laurence Fitzgibbon see him through the difficulties\r\nof the oath-taking? But Laurence Fitzgibbon made very little of the\r\ndifficulty. "Oh;--you just come down, and there\'ll be a rush of\r\nfellows, and you\'ll know everybody. You\'ll have to hang about for an\r\nhour or so, and then you\'ll get pushed through. There isn\'t time for\r\nmuch ceremony after a general election."\r\n\r\nPhineas reached London early in the morning, and went home to bed\r\nfor an hour or so. The House was to meet on that very day, and he\r\nintended to begin his parliamentary duties at once if he should find\r\nit possible to get some one to accompany him; He felt that he should\r\nlack courage to go down to Westminster Hall alone, and explain to\r\nthe policeman and door-keepers that he was the man who had just been\r\nelected member for Loughshane. So about noon he went into the Reform\r\nClub, and there he found a great crowd of men, among whom there was a\r\nplentiful sprinkling of members. Erle saw him in a moment, and came\r\nto him with congratulations.\r\n\r\n"So you\'re all right, Finn," said he.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I\'m all right,--I didn\'t have much doubt about it when I went\r\nover."\r\n\r\n"I never heard of a fellow with such a run of luck," said Erle. "It\'s\r\njust one of those flukes that occur once in a dozen elections. Any\r\none on earth might have got in without spending a shilling."\r\n\r\nPhineas didn\'t at all like this. "I don\'t think any one could have\r\ngot in," said he, "without knowing Lord Tulla."\r\n\r\n"Lord Tulla was nowhere, my dear boy, and could have nothing to say\r\nto it. But never mind that. You meet me in the lobby at two. There\'ll\r\nbe a lot of us there, and we\'ll go in together. Have you seen\r\nFitzgibbon?" Then Barrington Erle went off to other business, and\r\nFinn was congratulated by other men. But it seemed to him that the\r\ncongratulations of his friends were not hearty. He spoke to some men,\r\nof whom he thought that he knew they would have given their eyes\r\nto be in Parliament;--and yet they spoke of his success as being a\r\nvery ordinary thing. "Well, my boy, I hope you like it," said one\r\nmiddle-aged gentleman whom he had known ever since he came up to\r\nLondon. "The difference is between working for nothing and working\r\nfor money. You\'ll have to work for nothing now."\r\n\r\n"That\'s about it, I suppose," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"They say the House is a comfortable club," said the middle-aged\r\nfriend, "but I confess that I shouldn\'t like being rung away from my\r\ndinner myself."\r\n\r\nAt two punctually Phineas was in the lobby at Westminster, and then\r\nhe found himself taken into the House with a crowd of other men. The\r\nold and young, and they who were neither old nor young, were mingled\r\ntogether, and there seemed to be very little respect of persons. On\r\nthree or four occasions there was some cheering when a popular man or\r\na great leader came in; but the work of the day left but little clear\r\nimpression on the mind of the young member. He was confused, half\r\nelated, half disappointed, and had not his wits about him. He found\r\nhimself constantly regretting that he was there; and as constantly\r\ntelling himself that he, hardly yet twenty-five, without a shilling\r\nof his own, had achieved an entrance into that assembly which by the\r\nconsent of all men is the greatest in the world, and which many of\r\nthe rich magnates of the country had in vain spent heaps of treasure\r\nin their endeavours to open to their own footsteps. He tried hard to\r\nrealise what he had gained, but the dust and the noise and the crowds\r\nand the want of something august to the eye were almost too strong\r\nfor him. He managed, however, to take the oath early among those who\r\ntook it, and heard the Queen\'s speech read and the Address moved and\r\nseconded. He was seated very uncomfortably, high up on a back seat,\r\nbetween two men whom he did not know; and he found the speeches to be\r\nvery long. He had been in the habit of seeing such speeches reported\r\nin about a column, and he thought that these speeches must take at\r\nleast four columns each. He sat out the debate on the Address till\r\nthe House was adjourned, and then he went away to dine at his club.\r\nHe did go into the dining-room of the House, but there was a crowd\r\nthere, and he found himself alone,--and to tell the truth, he was\r\nafraid to order his dinner.\r\n\r\nThe nearest approach to a triumph which he had in London came to him\r\nfrom the glory which his election reflected upon his landlady. She\r\nwas a kindly good motherly soul, whose husband was a journeyman\r\nlaw-stationer, and who kept a very decent house in Great Marlborough\r\nStreet. Here Phineas had lodged since he had been in London, and was\r\na great favourite. "God bless my soul, Mr. Phineas," said she, "only\r\nthink of your being a member of Parliament!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m a member of Parliament, Mrs. Bunce."\r\n\r\n"And you\'ll go on with the rooms the same as ever? Well, I never\r\nthought to have a member of Parliament in \'em."\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunce really had realised the magnitude of the step which her\r\nlodger had taken, and Phineas was grateful to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nLady Laura Standish\r\n\r\n\r\nPhineas, in describing Lady Laura Standish to Mary Flood Jones at\r\nKillaloe, had not painted her in very glowing colours. Nevertheless\r\nhe admired Lady Laura very much, and she was worthy of admiration. It\r\nwas probably the greatest pride of our hero\'s life that Lady Laura\r\nStandish was his friend, and that she had instigated him to undertake\r\nthe risk of parliamentary life. Lady Laura was intimate also with\r\nBarrington Erle, who was, in some distant degree, her cousin;\r\nand Phineas was not without a suspicion that his selection for\r\nLoughshane, from out of all the young liberal candidates, may have\r\nbeen in some degree owing to Lady Laura\'s influence with Barrington\r\nErle. He was not unwilling that it should be so; for though,\r\nas he had repeatedly told himself, he was by no means in love\r\nwith Lady Laura,--who was, as he imagined, somewhat older than\r\nhimself,--nevertheless, he would feel gratified at accepting anything\r\nfrom her hands, and he felt a keen desire for some increase to those\r\nties of friendship which bound them together. No;--he was not in love\r\nwith Lady Laura Standish. He had not the remotest idea of asking her\r\nto be his wife. So he told himself, both before he went over for his\r\nelection, and after his return. When he had found himself in a corner\r\nwith poor little Mary Flood Jones, he had kissed her as a matter of\r\ncourse; but he did not think that he could, in any circumstances, be\r\ntempted to kiss Lady Laura. He supposed that he was in love with his\r\ndarling little Mary,--after a fashion. Of course, it could never come\r\nto anything, because of the circumstances of his life, which were\r\nso imperious to him. He was not in love with Lady Laura, and yet he\r\nhoped that his intimacy with her might come to much. He had more than\r\nonce asked himself how he would feel when somebody else came to be\r\nreally in love with Lady Laura,--for she was by no means a woman to\r\nlack lovers,--when some one else should be in love with her, and be\r\nreceived by her as a lover; but this question he had never been able\r\nto answer. There were many questions about himself which he usually\r\nanswered by telling himself that it was his fate to walk over\r\nvolcanoes. "Of course, I shall be blown into atoms some fine day," he\r\nwould say; "but after all, that is better than being slowly boiled\r\ndown into pulp."\r\n\r\nThe House had met on a Friday, again on the Saturday morning, and\r\nthe debate on the Address had been adjourned till the Monday. On\r\nthe Sunday, Phineas determined that he would see Lady Laura. She\r\nprofessed to be always at home on Sunday, and from three to four in\r\nthe afternoon her drawing-room would probably be half full of people.\r\nThere would, at any rate, be comers and goers, who would prevent\r\nanything like real conversation between himself and her. But for a\r\nfew minutes before that he might probably find her alone, and he was\r\nmost anxious to see whether her reception of him, as a member of\r\nParliament, would be in any degree warmer than that of his other\r\nfriends. Hitherto he had found no such warmth since he came to\r\nLondon, excepting that which had glowed in the bosom of Mrs. Bunce.\r\n\r\nLady Laura Standish was the daughter of the Earl of Brentford, and\r\nwas the only remaining lady of the Earl\'s family. The Countess had\r\nbeen long dead; and Lady Emily, the younger daughter, who had been\r\nthe great beauty of her day, was now the wife of a Russian nobleman\r\nwhom she had persisted in preferring to any of her English suitors,\r\nand lived at St. Petersburg. There was an aunt, old Lady Laura, who\r\ncame up to town about the middle of May; but she was always in the\r\ncountry except for some six weeks in the season. There was a certain\r\nLord Chiltern, the Earl\'s son and heir, who did indeed live at the\r\nfamily town house in Portman Square; but Lord Chiltern was a man of\r\nwhom Lady Laura\'s set did not often speak, and Phineas, frequently\r\nas he had been at the house, had never seen Lord Chiltern there. He\r\nwas a young nobleman of whom various accounts were given by various\r\npeople; but I fear that the account most readily accepted in London\r\nattributed to him a great intimacy with the affairs at Newmarket,\r\nand a partiality for convivial pleasures. Respecting Lord Chiltern\r\nPhineas had never as yet exchanged a word with Lady Laura. With her\r\nfather he was acquainted, as he had dined perhaps half a dozen times\r\nat the house. The point in Lord Brentford\'s character which had more\r\nthan any other struck our hero, was the unlimited confidence which he\r\nseemed to place in his daughter. Lady Laura seemed to have perfect\r\npower of doing what she pleased. She was much more mistress of\r\nherself than if she had been the wife instead of the daughter of the\r\nEarl of Brentford,--and she seemed to be quite as much mistress of\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nPhineas had declared at Killaloe that Lady Laura was six feet high,\r\nthat she had red hair, that her figure was straggling, and that her\r\nhands and feet were large. She was in fact about five feet seven\r\nin height, and she carried her height well. There was something of\r\nnobility in her gait, and she seemed thus to be taller than her\r\ninches. Her hair was in truth red,--of a deep thorough redness. Her\r\nbrother\'s hair was the same; and so had been that of her father,\r\nbefore it had become sandy with age. Her sister\'s had been of a soft\r\nauburn hue, and hers had been said to be the prettiest head of hair\r\nin Europe at the time of her marriage. But in these days we have got\r\nto like red hair, and Lady Laura\'s was not supposed to stand in the\r\nway of her being considered a beauty. Her face was very fair, though\r\nit lacked that softness which we all love in women. Her eyes, which\r\nwere large and bright, and very clear, never seemed to quail, never\r\nrose and sunk or showed themselves to be afraid of their own power.\r\nIndeed, Lady Laura Standish had nothing of fear about her. Her\r\nnose was perfectly cut, but was rather large, having the slightest\r\npossible tendency to be aquiline. Her mouth also was large, but was\r\nfull of expression, and her teeth were perfect. Her complexion was\r\nvery bright, but in spite of its brightness she never blushed. The\r\nshades of her complexion were set and steady. Those who knew her said\r\nthat her heart was so fully under command that nothing could stir her\r\nblood to any sudden motion. As to that accusation of straggling which\r\nhad been made against her, it had sprung from ill-natured observation\r\nof her modes of sitting. She never straggled when she stood or\r\nwalked; but she would lean forward when sitting, as a man does, and\r\nwould use her arms in talking, and would put her hand over her face,\r\nand pass her fingers through her hair,--after the fashion of men\r\nrather than of women;--and she seemed to despise that soft quiescence\r\nof her sex in which are generally found so many charms. Her hands\r\nand feet were large,--as was her whole frame. Such was Lady Laura\r\nStandish; and Phineas Finn had been untrue to himself and to his own\r\nappreciation of the lady when he had described her in disparaging\r\nterms to Mary Flood Jones. But, though he had spoken of Lady Laura\r\nin disparaging terms, he had so spoken of her as to make Miss Flood\r\nJones quite understand that he thought a great deal about Lady Laura.\r\n\r\nAnd now, early on the Sunday, he made his way to Portman Square in\r\norder that he might learn whether there might be any sympathy for him\r\nthere. Hitherto he had found none. Everything had been terribly dry\r\nand hard, and he had gathered as yet none of the fruit which he had\r\nexpected that his good fortune would bear for him. It is true that he\r\nhad not as yet gone among any friends, except those of his club, and\r\nmen who were in the House along with him;--and at the club it might\r\nbe that there were some who envied him his good fortune, and others\r\nwho thought nothing of it because it had been theirs for years. Now\r\nhe would try a friend who, he hoped, could sympathise; and therefore\r\nhe called in Portman Square at about half-past two on the Sunday\r\nmorning. Yes,--Lady Laura was in the drawing-room. The hall-porter\r\nadmitted as much, but evidently seemed to think that he had been\r\ndisturbed from his dinner before his time. Phineas did not care a\r\nstraw for the hall-porter. If Lady Laura were not kind to him, he\r\nwould never trouble that hall-porter again. He was especially sore at\r\nthis moment because a valued friend, the barrister with whom he had\r\nbeen reading for the last three years, had spent the best part of\r\nan hour that Sunday morning in proving to him that he had as good\r\nas ruined himself. "When I first heard it, of course I thought you\r\nhad inherited a fortune," said Mr. Low. "I have inherited nothing,"\r\nPhineas replied;--"not a penny; and I never shall." Then Mr. Low had\r\nopened his eyes very wide, and shaken his head very sadly, and had\r\nwhistled.\r\n\r\n"I am so glad you have come, Mr. Finn," said Lady Laura, meeting\r\nPhineas half-way across the large room.\r\n\r\n"Thanks," said he, as he took her hand.\r\n\r\n"I thought that perhaps you would manage to see me before any one\r\nelse was here."\r\n\r\n"Well;--to tell the truth, I have wished it; though I can hardly tell\r\nwhy."\r\n\r\n"I can tell you why, Mr. Finn. But never mind;--come and sit down.\r\nI am so very glad that you have been successful;--so very glad. You\r\nknow I told you that I should never think much of you if you did not\r\nat least try it."\r\n\r\n"And therefore I did try."\r\n\r\n"And have succeeded. Faint heart, you know, never did any good. I\r\nthink it is a man\'s duty to make his way into the House;--that is, if\r\nhe ever means to be anybody. Of course it is not every man who can\r\nget there by the time that he is five-and-twenty."\r\n\r\n"Every friend that I have in the world says that I have ruined\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"No;--I don\'t say so," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"And you are worth all the others put together. It is such a comfort\r\nto have some one to say a cheery word to one."\r\n\r\n"You shall hear nothing but cheery words here. Papa shall say cheery\r\nwords to you that shall be better than mine, because they shall be\r\nweighted with the wisdom of age. I have heard him say twenty times\r\nthat the earlier a man goes into the House the better. There is much\r\nto learn."\r\n\r\n"But your father was thinking of men of fortune."\r\n\r\n"Not at all;--of younger brothers, and barristers, and of men who\r\nhave their way to make, as you have. Let me see,--can you dine here\r\non Wednesday? There will be no party, of course, but papa will want\r\nto shake hands with you; and you legislators of the Lower House are\r\nmore easily reached on Wednesdays than on any other day."\r\n\r\n"I shall be delighted," said Phineas, feeling, however, that he did\r\nnot expect much sympathy from Lord Brentford.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Kennedy dines here;--you know Mr. Kennedy, of Loughlinter; and\r\nwe will ask your friend Mr. Fitzgibbon. There will be nobody else. As\r\nfor catching Barrington Erle, that is out of the question at such a\r\ntime as this."\r\n\r\n"But going back to my being ruined--" said Phineas, after a pause.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t think of anything so disagreeable."\r\n\r\n"You must not suppose that I am afraid of it. I was going to say that\r\nthere are worse things than ruin,--or, at any rate, than the chance\r\nof ruin. Supposing that I have to emigrate and skin sheep, what\r\ndoes it matter? I myself, being unencumbered, have myself as my own\r\nproperty to do what I like with. With Nelson it was Westminster Abbey\r\nor a peerage. With me it is parliamentary success or sheep-skinning."\r\n\r\n"There shall be no sheep-skinning, Mr. Finn. I will guarantee you."\r\n\r\n"Then I shall be safe."\r\n\r\nAt that moment the door of the room was opened, and a man entered\r\nwith quick steps, came a few yards in, and then retreated, slamming\r\nthe door after him. He was a man with thick short red hair, and an\r\nabundance of very red beard. And his face was red,--and, as it seemed\r\nto Phineas, his very eyes. There was something in the countenance of\r\nthe man which struck him almost with dread,--something approaching to\r\nferocity.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause a moment after the door was closed, and then Lady\r\nLaura spoke. "It was my brother Chiltern. I do not think that you\r\nhave ever met him."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Low\r\n\r\n\r\nThat terrible apparition of the red Lord Chiltern had disturbed\r\nPhineas in the moment of his happiness as he sat listening to the\r\nkind flatteries of Lady Laura; and though Lord Chiltern had vanished\r\nas quickly as he had appeared, there had come no return of his joy.\r\nLady Laura had said some word about her brother, and Phineas had\r\nreplied that he had never chanced to see Lord Chiltern. Then there\r\nhad been an awkward silence, and almost immediately other persons had\r\ncome in. After greeting one or two old acquaintances, among whom an\r\nelder sister of Laurence Fitzgibbon was one, he took his leave and\r\nescaped out into the square. "Miss Fitzgibbon is going to dine with\r\nus on Wednesday," said Lady Laura. "She says she won\'t answer for her\r\nbrother, but she will bring him if she can."\r\n\r\n"And you\'re a member of Parliament now too, they tell me," said Miss\r\nFitzgibbon, holding up her hands. "I think everybody will be in\r\nParliament before long. I wish I knew some man who wasn\'t, that I\r\nmight think of changing my condition."\r\n\r\nBut Phineas cared very little what Miss Fitzgibbon said to him.\r\nEverybody knew Aspasia Fitzgibbon, and all who knew her were\r\naccustomed to put up with the violence of her jokes and the\r\nbitterness of her remarks. She was an old maid, over forty, very\r\nplain, who, having reconciled herself to the fact that she was an old\r\nmaid, chose to take advantage of such poor privileges as the position\r\ngave her. Within the last few years a considerable fortune had fallen\r\ninto her hands, some twenty-five thousand pounds, which had come to\r\nher unexpectedly,--a wonderful windfall. And now she was the only one\r\nof her family who had money at command. She lived in a small house by\r\nherself, in one of the smallest streets of May Fair, and walked about\r\nsturdily by herself, and spoke her mind about everything. She was\r\ngreatly devoted to her brother Laurence,--so devoted that there was\r\nnothing she would not do for him, short of lending him money.\r\n\r\nBut Phineas when he found himself out in the square thought nothing\r\nof Aspasia Fitzgibbon. He had gone to Lady Laura Standish for\r\nsympathy, and she had given it to him in full measure. She understood\r\nhim and his aspirations if no one else did so on the face of the\r\nearth. She rejoiced in his triumph, and was not too hard to tell him\r\nthat she looked forward to his success. And in what delightful\r\nlanguage she had done so! "Faint heart never won fair lady." It was\r\nthus, or almost thus, that she had encouraged him. He knew well that\r\nshe had in truth meant nothing more than her words had seemed to\r\nsignify. He did not for a moment attribute to her aught else. But\r\nmight not he get another lesson from them? He had often told himself\r\nthat he was not in love with Laura Standish;--but why should he not\r\nhow tell himself that he was in love with her? Of course there would\r\nbe difficulty. But was it not the business of his life to overcome\r\ndifficulties? Had he not already overcome one difficulty almost as\r\ngreat; and why should he be afraid of this other? Faint heart never\r\nwon fair lady! And this fair lady,--for at this moment he was ready\r\nto swear that she was very fair,--was already half won. She could not\r\nhave taken him by the hand so warmly, and looked into his face so\r\nkeenly, had she not felt for him something stronger than common\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\nHe had turned down Baker Street from the square, and was now walking\r\ntowards the Regent\'s Park. He would go and see the beasts in the\r\nZoological Gardens, and make up his mind as to his future mode of\r\nlife in that delightful Sunday solitude. There was very much as to\r\nwhich it was necessary that he should make up his mind. If he\r\nresolved that he would ask Lady Laura Standish to be his wife, when\r\nshould he ask her, and in what manner might he propose to her that\r\nthey should live? It would hardly suit him to postpone his courtship\r\nindefinitely, knowing, as he did know, that he would be one among\r\nmany suitors. He could not expect her to wait for him if he did not\r\ndeclare himself. And yet he could hardly ask her to come and share\r\nwith him the allowance made to him by his father! Whether she had\r\nmuch fortune of her own, or little, or none at all, he did not in the\r\nleast know. He did know that the Earl had been distressed by his\r\nson\'s extravagance, and that there had been some money difficulties\r\narising from this source.\r\n\r\nBut his great desire would be to support his own wife by his own\r\nlabour. At present he was hardly in a fair way to do that, unless he\r\ncould get paid for his parliamentary work. Those fortunate gentlemen\r\nwho form "The Government" are so paid. Yes;--there was the Treasury\r\nBench open to him, and he must resolve that he would seat himself\r\nthere. He would make Lady Laura understand this, and then he would\r\nask his question. It was true that at present his political opponents\r\nhad possession of the Treasury Bench;--but all governments are\r\nmortal, and Conservative governments in this country are especially\r\nprone to die. It was true that he could not hold even a Treasury\r\nlordship with a poor thousand a year for his salary without having to\r\nface the electors of Loughshane again before he entered upon the\r\nenjoyment of his place;--but if he could only do something to give a\r\ngrace to his name, to show that he was a rising man, the electors of\r\nLoughshane, who had once been so easy with him, would surely not be\r\ncruel to him when he showed himself a second time among them. Lord\r\nTulla was his friend, and he had those points of law in his favour\r\nwhich possession bestows. And then he remembered that Lady Laura was\r\nrelated to almost everybody who was anybody among the high Whigs. She\r\nwas, he knew, second cousin to Mr. Mildmay, who for years had been\r\nthe leader of the Whigs, and was third cousin to Barrington Erle. The\r\nlate President of the Council, the Duke of St. Bungay, and Lord\r\nBrentford had married sisters, and the St. Bungay people, and the\r\nMildmay people, and the Brentford people had all some sort of\r\nconnection with the Palliser people, of whom the heir and coming\r\nchief, Plantagenet Palliser, would certainly be Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer in the next Government. Simply as an introduction into\r\nofficial life nothing could be more conducive to chances of success\r\nthan a matrimonial alliance with Lady Laura. Not that he would have\r\nthought of such a thing on that account! No;--he thought of it\r\nbecause he loved her; honestly because he loved her. He swore to that\r\nhalf a dozen times, for his own satisfaction. But, loving her as he\r\ndid, and resolving that in spite of all difficulties she should\r\nbecome his wife, there could be no reason why he should not,--on her\r\naccount as well as on his own,--take advantage of any circumstances\r\nthat there might be in his favour.\r\n\r\nAs he wandered among the unsavoury beasts, elbowed on every side by\r\nthe Sunday visitors to the garden, he made up his mind that he would\r\nfirst let Lady Laura understand what were his intentions with regard\r\nto his future career, and then he would ask her to join her lot to\r\nhis. At every turn the chances would of course be very much against\r\nhim;--ten to one against him, perhaps, on every point; but it was his\r\nlot in life to have to face such odds. Twelve months since it had\r\nbeen much more than ten to one against his getting into Parliament;\r\nand yet he was there. He expected to be blown into fragments,--to\r\nsheep-skinning in Australia, or packing preserved meats on the plains\r\nof Paraguay; but when the blowing into atoms should come, he was\r\nresolved that courage to bear the ruin should not be wanting. Then he\r\nquoted a line or two of a Latin poet, and felt himself to be\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\n"So, here you are again, Mr. Finn," said a voice in his ear.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss Fitzgibbon; here I am again."\r\n\r\n"I fancied you members of Parliament had something else to do besides\r\nlooking at wild beasts. I thought you always spent Sunday in\r\narranging how you might most effectually badger each other on\r\nMonday."\r\n\r\n"We got through all that early this morning, Miss Fitzgibbon, while\r\nyou were saying your prayers."\r\n\r\n"Here is Mr. Kennedy too;--you know him I daresay. He also is a\r\nmember; but then he can afford to be idle." But it so happened that\r\nPhineas did not know Mr. Kennedy, and consequently there was some\r\nslight form of introduction.\r\n\r\n"I believe I am to meet you at dinner on Wednesday,"--said\r\nPhineas,--"at Lord Brentford\'s."\r\n\r\n"And me too," said Miss Fitzgibbon.\r\n\r\n"Which will be the greatest possible addition to our pleasure," said\r\nPhineas.\r\n\r\nMr. Kennedy, who seemed to be afflicted with some difficulty in\r\nspeaking, and whose bow to our hero had hardly done more than produce\r\nthe slightest possible motion to the top of his hat, hereupon\r\nmuttered something which was taken to mean an assent to the\r\nproposition as to Wednesday\'s dinner. Then he stood perfectly still,\r\nwith his two hands fixed on the top of his umbrella, and gazed at the\r\ngreat monkeys\' cage. But it was clear that he was not looking at any\r\nspecial monkey, for his eyes never wandered.\r\n\r\n"Did you ever see such a contrast in your life?" said Miss Fitzgibbon\r\nto Phineas,--hardly in a whisper.\r\n\r\n"Between what?" said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Between Mr. Kennedy and a monkey. The monkey has so much to say for\r\nhimself, and is so delightfully wicked! I don\'t suppose that Mr.\r\nKennedy ever did anything wrong in his life."\r\n\r\nMr. Kennedy was a man who had very little temptation to do anything\r\nwrong. He was possessed of over a million and a half of money, which\r\nhe was mistaken enough to suppose he had made himself; whereas it may\r\nbe doubted whether he had ever earned a penny. His father and his\r\nuncle had created a business in Glasgow, and that business now\r\nbelonged to him. But his father and his uncle, who had toiled through\r\ntheir long lives, had left behind them servants who understood the\r\nwork, and the business now went on prospering almost by its own\r\nmomentum. The Mr. Kennedy of the present day, the sole owner of the\r\nbusiness, though he did occasionally go to Glasgow, certainly did\r\nnothing towards maintaining it. He had a magnificent place in\r\nPerthshire, called Loughlinter, and he sat for a Scotch group of\r\nboroughs, and he had a house in London, and a stud of horses in\r\nLeicestershire, which he rarely visited, and was unmarried. He never\r\nspoke much to any one, although he was constantly in society. He\r\nrarely did anything, although he had the means of doing everything.\r\nHe had very seldom been on his legs in the House of Commons, though\r\nhe had sat there for ten years. He was seen about everywhere,\r\nsometimes with one acquaintance and sometimes with another;--but it\r\nmay be doubted whether he had any friend. It may be doubted whether\r\nhe had ever talked enough to any man to make that man his friend.\r\nLaurence Fitzgibbon tried him for one season, and after a month or\r\ntwo asked for a loan of a few hundred pounds. "I never lend money to\r\nany one under any circumstances," said Mr. Kennedy, and it was the\r\nlongest speech which had ever fallen from his mouth in the hearing of\r\nLaurence Fitzgibbon. But though he would not lend money, he gave a\r\ngreat deal,--and he would give it for almost every object. "Mr.\r\nRobert Kennedy, M.P., Loughlinter, L105," appeared on almost every\r\ncharitable list that was advertised. No one ever spoke to him as to\r\nthis expenditure, nor did he ever speak to any one. Circulars came to\r\nhim and the cheques were returned. The duty was a very easy one to\r\nhim, and he performed it willingly. Had any amount of inquiry been\r\nnecessary, it is possible that the labour would have been too much\r\nfor him. Such was Mr. Robert Kennedy, as to whom Phineas had heard\r\nthat he had during the last winter entertained Lord Brentford and\r\nLady Laura, with very many other people of note, at his place in\r\nPerthshire.\r\n\r\n"I very much prefer the monkey," said Phineas to Miss Fitzgibbon.\r\n\r\n"I thought you would," said she. "Like to like, you know. You have\r\nboth of you the same aptitude for climbing. But the monkeys never\r\nfall, they tell me."\r\n\r\nPhineas, knowing that he could gain nothing by sparring with Miss\r\nFitzgibbon, raised his hat and took his leave. Going out of a narrow\r\ngate he found himself again brought into contact with Mr. Kennedy.\r\n"What a crowd there is here," he said, finding himself bound to say\r\nsomething. Mr. Kennedy, who was behind him, answered him not a word.\r\nThen Phineas made up his mind that Mr. Kennedy was insolent with the\r\ninsolence of riches, and that he would hate Mr. Kennedy.\r\n\r\nHe was engaged to dine on this Sunday with Mr. Low, the barrister,\r\nwith whom he had been reading for the last three years. Mr. Low had\r\ntaken a strong liking to Phineas, as had also Mrs. Low, and the tutor\r\nhad more than once told his pupil that success in his profession was\r\ncertainly open to him if he would only stick to his work. Mr. Low was\r\nhimself an ambitious man, looking forward to entering Parliament at\r\nsome future time, when the exigencies of his life of labour might\r\nenable him to do so; but he was prudent, given to close calculation,\r\nand resolved to make the ground sure beneath his feet in every step\r\nthat he took forward. When he first heard that Finn intended to stand\r\nfor Loughshane he was stricken with dismay, and strongly dissuaded\r\nhim. "The electors may probably reject him. That\'s his only chance\r\nnow," Mr. Low had said to his wife, when he found that Phineas was,\r\nas he thought, foolhardy. But the electors of Loughshane had not\r\nrejected Mr. Low\'s pupil, and Mr. Low was now called upon to advise\r\nwhat Phineas should do in his present circumstances. There is nothing\r\nto prevent the work of a Chancery barrister being done by a member of\r\nParliament. Indeed, the most successful barristers are members of\r\nParliament. But Phineas Finn was beginning at the wrong end, and Mr.\r\nLow knew that no good would come of it.\r\n\r\n"Only think of your being in Parliament, Mr. Finn," said Mrs. Low.\r\n\r\n"It is wonderful, isn\'t it?" said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"It took us so much by surprise!" said Mrs. Low. "As a rule one never\r\nhears of a barrister going into Parliament till after he\'s forty."\r\n\r\n"And I\'m only twenty-five. I do feel that I\'ve disgraced myself. I\r\ndo, indeed, Mrs. Low."\r\n\r\n"No;--you\'ve not disgraced yourself, Mr. Finn. The only question is,\r\nwhether it\'s prudent. I hope it will all turn out for the best, most\r\nheartily." Mrs. Low was a very matter-of-fact lady, four or five\r\nyears older than her husband, who had had a little money of her own,\r\nand was possessed of every virtue under the sun. Nevertheless she did\r\nnot quite like the idea of her husband\'s pupil having got into\r\nParliament. If her husband and Phineas Finn were dining anywhere\r\ntogether, Phineas, who had come to them quite a boy, would walk out\r\nof the room before her husband. This could hardly be right!\r\nNevertheless she helped Phineas to the nicest bit of fish she could\r\nfind, and had he been ill, would have nursed him with the greatest\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, when Mrs. Low had gone up-stairs, there came the great\r\ndiscussion between the tutor and the pupil, for the sake of which\r\nthis little dinner had been given. When Phineas had last been with\r\nMr. Low,--on the occasion of his showing himself at his tutor\'s\r\nchambers after his return from Ireland,--he had not made up his mind\r\nso thoroughly on certain points as he had done since he had seen Lady\r\nLaura. The discussion could hardly be of any avail now,--but it could\r\nnot be avoided.\r\n\r\n"Well, Phineas, and what do you mean to do?" said Mr. Low. Everybody\r\nwho knew our hero, or nearly everybody, called him by his Christian\r\nname. There are men who seem to be so treated by general consent in\r\nall societies. Even Mrs. Low, who was very prosaic, and unlikely to\r\nbe familiar in her mode of address, had fallen into the way of doing\r\nit before the election. But she had dropped it, when the Phineas whom\r\nshe used to know became a member of Parliament.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the question;--isn\'t it?" said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Of course you\'ll stick to your work?"\r\n\r\n"What;--to the Bar?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--to the Bar."\r\n\r\n"I am not thinking of giving it up permanently."\r\n\r\n"Giving it up," said Mr. Low, raising his hands in surprise. "If you\r\ngive it up, how do you intend to live? Men are not paid for being\r\nmembers of Parliament."\r\n\r\n"Not exactly. But, as I said before, I am not thinking of giving it\r\nup,--permanently."\r\n\r\n"You mustn\'t give it up at all,--not for a day; that is, if you ever\r\nmean to do any good."\r\n\r\n"There I think that perhaps you may be wrong, Low!"\r\n\r\n"How can I be wrong? Did a period of idleness ever help a man in any\r\nprofession? And is it not acknowledged by all who know anything about\r\nit, that continuous labour is more necessary in our profession than\r\nin any other?"\r\n\r\n"I do not mean to be idle."\r\n\r\n"What is it you do mean, Phineas?"\r\n\r\n"Why simply this. Here I am in Parliament. We must take that as a\r\nfact."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t doubt the fact."\r\n\r\n"And if it be a misfortune, we must make the best of it. Even you\r\nwouldn\'t advise me to apply for the Chiltern Hundreds at once."\r\n\r\n"I would;--to-morrow. My dear fellow, though I do not like to give\r\nyou pain, if you come to me I can only tell you what I think. My\r\nadvice to you is to give it up to-morrow. Men would laugh at you for\r\na few weeks, but that is better than being ruined for life."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t do that," said Phineas, sadly.\r\n\r\n"Very well;--then let us go on," said Mr. Low. "If you won\'t give up\r\nyour seat, the next best thing will be to take care that it shall\r\ninterfere as little as possible with your work. I suppose you must\r\nsit upon some Committees."\r\n\r\n"My idea is this,--that I will give up one year to learning the\r\npractices of the House."\r\n\r\n"And do nothing?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing but that. Why, the thing is a study in itself. As for\r\nlearning it in a year, that is out of the question. But I am\r\nconvinced that if a man intends to be a useful member of Parliament,\r\nhe should make a study of it."\r\n\r\n"And how do you mean to live in the meantime?" Mr. Low, who was an\r\nenergetic man, had assumed almost an angry tone of voice. Phineas for\r\nawhile sat silent;--not that he felt himself to be without words for\r\na reply, but that he was thinking in what fewest words he might best\r\nconvey his ideas. "You have a very modest allowance from your father,\r\non which you have never been able to keep yourself free from debt,"\r\ncontinued Mr. Low.\r\n\r\n"He has increased it."\r\n\r\n"And will it satisfy you to live here, in what will turn out to be\r\nparliamentary club idleness, on the savings of his industrious life?\r\nI think you will find yourself unhappy if you do that. Phineas, my\r\ndear fellow, as far as I have as yet been able to see the world, men\r\ndon\'t begin either very good or very bad. They have generally good\r\naspirations with infirm purposes;--or, as we may say, strong bodies\r\nwith weak legs to carry them. Then, because their legs are weak, they\r\ndrift into idleness and ruin. During all this drifting they are\r\nwretched, and when they have thoroughly drifted they are still\r\nwretched. The agony of their old disappointment still clings to them.\r\nIn nine cases out of ten it is some one small unfortunate event that\r\nputs a man astray at first. He sees some woman and loses himself with\r\nher;--or he is taken to a racecourse and unluckily wins money;--or\r\nsome devil in the shape of a friend lures him to tobacco and brandy.\r\nYour temptation has come in the shape of this accursed seat in\r\nParliament." Mr. Low had never said a soft word in his life to any\r\nwoman but the wife of his bosom, had never seen a racehorse, always\r\nconfined himself to two glasses of port after dinner, and looked upon\r\nsmoking as the darkest of all the vices.\r\n\r\n"You have made up your mind, then, that I mean to be idle?"\r\n\r\n"I have made up my mind that your time will be wholly\r\nunprofitable,--if you do as you say you intend to do."\r\n\r\n"But you do not know my plan;--just listen to me." Then Mr. Low did\r\nlisten, and Phineas explained his plan,--saying, of course, nothing\r\nof his love for Lady Laura, but giving Mr. Low to understand that he\r\nintended to assist in turning out the existing Government and to\r\nmount up to some seat,--a humble seat at first,--on the Treasury\r\nbench, by the help of his exalted friends and by the use of his own\r\ngifts of eloquence. Mr. Low heard him without a word. "Of course,"\r\nsaid Phineas, "after the first year my time will not be fully\r\nemployed, unless I succeed. And if I fail totally,--for, of course, I\r\nmay fail altogether--"\r\n\r\n"It is possible," said Mr. Low.\r\n\r\n"If you are resolved to turn yourself against me, I must not say\r\nanother word," said Phineas, with anger.\r\n\r\n"Turn myself against you! I would turn myself any way so that I might\r\nsave you from the sort of life which you are preparing for yourself.\r\nI see nothing in it that can satisfy any manly heart. Even if you are\r\nsuccessful, what are you to become? You will be the creature of some\r\nminister, not his colleague. You are to make your way up the ladder\r\nby pretending to agree whenever agreement is demanded from you, and\r\nby voting whether you agree or do not. And what is to be your reward?\r\nSome few precarious hundreds a year, lasting just so long as a party\r\nmay remain in power and you can retain a seat in Parliament! It is at\r\nthe best slavery and degradation,--even if you are lucky enough to\r\nachieve the slavery."\r\n\r\n"You yourself hope to go into Parliament and join a ministry some\r\nday," said Phineas.\r\n\r\nMr. Low was not quick to answer, but he did answer at last. "That is\r\ntrue, though I have never told you so. Indeed, it is hardly true to\r\nsay that I hope it. I have my dreams, and sometimes dare to tell\r\nmyself that they may possibly become waking facts. But if ever I sit\r\non a Treasury bench I shall sit there by special invitation, having\r\nbeen summoned to take a high place because of my professional\r\nsuccess. It is but a dream after all, and I would not have you repeat\r\nwhat I have said to any one. I had no intention to talk about\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"I am sure that you will succeed," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I shall succeed. I am succeeding. I live upon what I earn,\r\nlike a gentleman, and can already afford to be indifferent to work\r\nthat I dislike. After all, the other part of it,--that of which I\r\ndream,--is but an unnecessary adjunct; the gilding on the\r\ngingerbread. I am inclined to think that the cake is more wholesome\r\nwithout it."\r\n\r\nPhineas did not go up-stairs into Mrs. Low\'s drawing-room on that\r\nevening, nor did he stay very late with Mr. Low. He had heard enough\r\nof counsel to make him very unhappy,--to shake from him much of the\r\naudacity which he had acquired for himself during his morning\'s\r\nwalk,--and to make him almost doubt whether, after all, the\r\nChiltern Hundreds would not be for him the safest escape from his\r\ndifficulties. But in that case he must never venture to see Lady\r\nLaura Standish again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nLord Brentford\'s Dinner\r\n\r\n\r\nNo;--in such case as that,--should he resolve upon taking the advice\r\nof his old friend Mr. Low, Phineas Finn must make up his mind never\r\nto see Lady Laura Standish again! And he was in love with Lady Laura\r\nStandish;--and, for aught he knew, Lady Laura Standish might be in\r\nlove with him. As he walked home from Mr. Low\'s house in Bedford\r\nSquare, he was by no means a triumphant man. There had been much more\r\nsaid between him and Mr. Low than could be laid before the reader\r\nin the last chapter. Mr. Low had urged him again and again, and had\r\nprevailed so far that Phineas, before he left the house, had promised\r\nto consider that suicidal expedient of the Chiltern Hundreds. What a\r\nby-word he would become if he were to give up Parliament, having sat\r\nthere for about a week! But such immediate giving up was one of the\r\nnecessities of Mr. Low\'s programme. According to Mr. Low\'s teaching,\r\na single year passed amidst the miasma of the House of Commons would\r\nbe altogether fatal to any chance of professional success. And Mr.\r\nLow had at any rate succeeded in making Phineas believe that he\r\nwas right in this lesson. There was his profession, as to which Mr.\r\nLow assured him that success was within his reach; and there was\r\nParliament on the other side, as to which he knew that the chances\r\nwere all against him, in spite of his advantage of a seat. That he\r\ncould not combine the two, beginning with Parliament, he did believe.\r\nWhich should it be? That was the question which he tried to decide\r\nas he walked home from Bedford Square to Great Marlborough Street.\r\nHe could not answer the question satisfactorily, and went to bed an\r\nunhappy man.\r\n\r\nHe must at any rate go to Lord Brentford\'s dinner on Wednesday, and,\r\nto enable him to join in the conversation there, must attend the\r\ndebates on Monday and Tuesday. The reader may perhaps be best made to\r\nunderstand how terrible was our hero\'s state of doubt by being told\r\nthat for awhile he thought of absenting himself from these debates,\r\nas being likely to weaken his purpose of withdrawing altogether from\r\nthe House. It is not very often that so strong a fury rages between\r\nparty and party at the commencement of the session that a division\r\nis taken upon the Address. It is customary for the leader of the\r\nopposition on such occasions to express his opinion in the most\r\ncourteous language, that his right honourable friend, sitting\r\nopposite to him on the Treasury bench, has been, is, and will be\r\nwrong in everything that he thinks, says, or does in public life; but\r\nthat, as anything like factious opposition is never adopted on that\r\nside of the House, the Address to the Queen, in answer to that most\r\nfatuous speech which has been put into her Majesty\'s gracious mouth,\r\nshall be allowed to pass unquestioned. Then the leader of the House\r\nthanks his adversary for his consideration, explains to all men how\r\nhappy the country ought to be that the Government has not fallen into\r\nthe disgracefully incapable hands of his right honourable friend\r\nopposite; and after that the Address is carried amidst universal\r\nserenity. But such was not the order of the day on the present\r\noccasion. Mr. Mildmay, the veteran leader of the liberal side of the\r\nHouse, had moved an amendment to the Address, and had urged upon the\r\nHouse, in very strong language, the expediency of showing, at the\r\nvery commencement of the session, that the country had returned\r\nto Parliament a strong majority determined not to put up with\r\nConservative inactivity. "I conceive it to be my duty," Mr. Mildmay\r\nhad said, "at once to assume that the country is unwilling that the\r\nright honourable gentlemen opposite should keep their seats on the\r\nbench upon which they sit, and in the performance of that duty I am\r\ncalled upon to divide the House upon the Address to her Majesty." And\r\nif Mr. Mildmay used strong language, the reader may be sure that Mr.\r\nMildmay\'s followers used language much stronger. And Mr. Daubeny, who\r\nwas the present leader of the House, and representative there of the\r\nMinistry,--Lord de Terrier, the Premier, sitting in the House of\r\nLords,--was not the man to allow these amenities to pass by without\r\nadequate replies. He and his friends were very strong in sarcasm,\r\nif they failed in argument, and lacked nothing for words, though\r\nit might perhaps be proved that they were short in numbers. It was\r\nconsidered that the speech in which Mr. Daubeny reviewed the long\r\npolitical life of Mr. Mildmay, and showed that Mr. Mildmay had been\r\nat one time a bugbear, and then a nightmare, and latterly simply a\r\nfungus, was one of the severest attacks, if not the most severe, that\r\nhad been heard in that House since the Reform Bill. Mr. Mildmay, the\r\nwhile, was sitting with his hat low down over his eyes, and many men\r\nsaid that he did not like it. But this speech was not made till after\r\nthat dinner at Lord Brentford\'s, of which a short account must be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nHad it not been for the overwhelming interest of the doings in\r\nParliament at the commencement of the session, Phineas might have\r\nperhaps abstained from attending, in spite of the charm of novelty.\r\nFor, in truth, Mr. Low\'s words had moved him much. But if it was to\r\nbe his fate to be a member of Parliament only for ten days, surely it\r\nwould be well that he should take advantage of the time to hear such\r\na debate as this. It would be a thing to talk of to his children in\r\ntwenty years\' time, or to his grandchildren in fifty;--and it would\r\nbe essentially necessary that he should be able to talk of it to Lady\r\nLaura Standish. He did, therefore, sit in the House till one on the\r\nMonday night, and till two on the Tuesday night, and heard the debate\r\nadjourned till the Thursday. On the Thursday Mr. Daubeny was to make\r\nhis great speech, and then the division would come.\r\n\r\nWhen Phineas entered Lady Laura\'s drawing-room on the Wednesday\r\nbefore dinner, he found the other guests all assembled. Why men\r\nshould have been earlier in keeping their dinner engagements on that\r\nday than on any other he did not understand; but it was the fact,\r\nprobably, that the great anxiety of the time made those who were at\r\nall concerned in the matter very keen to hear and to be heard. During\r\nthese days everybody was in a hurry,--everybody was eager; and there\r\nwas a common feeling that not a minute was to be lost. There were\r\nthree ladies in the room,--Lady Laura, Miss Fitzgibbon, and Mrs.\r\nBonteen. The latter was the wife of a gentleman who had been a junior\r\nLord of the Admiralty in the late Government, and who lived in the\r\nexpectation of filling, perhaps, some higher office in the Government\r\nwhich, as he hoped, was soon to be called into existence. There\r\nwere five gentlemen besides Phineas Finn himself,--Mr. Bonteen, Mr.\r\nKennedy, Mr. Fitzgibbon, Barrington Erle, who had been caught in\r\nspite of all that Lady Laura had said as to the difficulty of such\r\nan operation, and Lord Brentford. Phineas was quick to observe that\r\nevery male guest was in Parliament, and to tell himself that he would\r\nnot have been there unless he also had had a seat.\r\n\r\n"We are all here now," said the Earl, ringing the bell.\r\n\r\n"I hope I\'ve not kept you waiting," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Not at all," said Lady Laura. "I do not know why we are in such a\r\nhurry. And how many do you say it will be, Mr. Finn?"\r\n\r\n"Seventeen, I suppose," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"More likely twenty-two," said Mr. Bonteen. "There is Colcleugh so\r\nill they can\'t possibly bring him up, and young Rochester is at\r\nVienna, and Gunning is sulking about something, and Moody has lost\r\nhis eldest son. By George! they pressed him to come up, although\r\nFrank Moody won\'t be buried till Friday."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe it," said Lord Brentford.\r\n\r\n"You ask some of the Carlton fellows, and they\'ll own it."\r\n\r\n"If I\'d lost every relation I had in the world," said Fitzgibbon,\r\n"I\'d vote on such a question as this. Staying away won\'t bring poor\r\nFrank Moody back to life."\r\n\r\n"But there\'s a decency in these matters, is there not, Mr.\r\nFitzgibbon?" said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"I thought they had thrown all that kind of thing overboard long\r\nago," said Miss Fitzgibbon. "It would be better that they should have\r\nno veil, than squabble about the thickness of it."\r\n\r\nThen dinner was announced. The Earl walked off with Miss Fitzgibbon,\r\nBarrington Erle took Mrs. Bonteen, and Mr. Fitzgibbon took Lady\r\nLaura.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bet four pounds to two it\'s over nineteen," said Mr. Bonteen,\r\nas he passed through the drawing-room door. The remark seemed to have\r\nbeen addressed to Mr. Kennedy, and Phineas therefore made no reply.\r\n\r\n"I daresay it will," said Kennedy, "but I never bet."\r\n\r\n"But you vote--sometimes, I hope," said Bonteen.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes," said Mr. Kennedy.\r\n\r\n"I think he is the most odious man that ever I set my eyes on," said\r\nPhineas to himself as he followed Mr. Kennedy into the dining-room.\r\nHe had observed that Mr. Kennedy had been standing very near to Lady\r\nLaura in the drawing-room, and that Lady Laura had said a few words\r\nto him. He was more determined than ever that he would hate Mr.\r\nKennedy, and would probably have been moody and unhappy throughout\r\nthe whole dinner had not Lady Laura called him to a chair at her left\r\nhand. It was very generous of her; and the more so, as Mr. Kennedy\r\nhad, in a half-hesitating manner, prepared to seat himself in that\r\nvery place. As it was, Phineas and Mr. Kennedy were neighbours, but\r\nPhineas had the place of honour.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you will not speak during the debate?" said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"Who? I? Certainly not. In the first place, I could not get a\r\nhearing, and, in the next place, I should not think of commencing on\r\nsuch an occasion. I do not know that I shall ever speak at all."\r\n\r\n"Indeed you will. You are just the sort of man who will succeed with\r\nthe House. What I doubt is, whether you will do as well in office."\r\n\r\n"I wish I might have the chance."\r\n\r\n"Of course you can have the chance if you try for it. Beginning so\r\nearly, and being on the right side,--and, if you will allow me to say\r\nso, among the right set,--there can be no doubt that you may take\r\noffice if you will. But I am not sure that you will be tractable. You\r\ncannot begin, you know, by being Prime Minister."\r\n\r\n"I have seen enough to realise that already," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"If you will only keep that little fact steadily before your eyes,\r\nthere is nothing you may not reach in official life. But Pitt was\r\nPrime Minister at four-and-twenty, and that precedent has ruined half\r\nour young politicians."\r\n\r\n"It has not affected me, Lady Laura."\r\n\r\n"As far as I can see, there is no great difficulty in government. A\r\nman must learn to have words at command when he is on his legs in\r\nthe House of Commons, in the same way as he would if he were talking\r\nto his own servants. He must keep his temper; and he must be very\r\npatient. As far as I have seen Cabinet Ministers, they are not more\r\nclever than other people."\r\n\r\n"I think there are generally one or two men of ability in the\r\nCabinet."\r\n\r\n"Yes, of fair ability. Mr. Mildmay is a good specimen. There is not,\r\nand never was, anything brilliant in him. He is not eloquent, nor,\r\nas far as I am aware, did he ever create anything. But he has always\r\nbeen a steady, honest, persevering man, and circumstances have made\r\npolitics come easy to him."\r\n\r\n"Think of the momentous questions which he has been called upon to\r\ndecide," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Every question so handled by him has been decided rightly according\r\nto his own party, and wrongly according to the party opposite. A\r\npolitical leader is so sure of support and so sure of attack, that\r\nit is hardly necessary for him to be even anxious to be right. For\r\nthe country\'s sake, he should have officials under him who know the\r\nroutine of business."\r\n\r\n"You think very badly then of politics as a profession."\r\n\r\n"No; I think of them very highly. It must be better to deal with\r\nthe repeal of laws than the defending of criminals. But all this is\r\npapa\'s wisdom, not mine. Papa has never been in the Cabinet yet, and\r\ntherefore of course he is a little caustic."\r\n\r\n"I think he was quite right," said Barrington Erle stoutly. He spoke\r\nso stoutly that everybody at the table listened to him.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t exactly see the necessity for such internecine war just at\r\npresent," said Lord Brentford.\r\n\r\n"I must say I do," said the other. "Lord de Terrier took office\r\nknowing that he was in a minority. We had a fair majority of nearly\r\nthirty when he came in."\r\n\r\n"Then how very soft you must have been to go out," said Miss\r\nFitzgibbon.\r\n\r\n"Not in the least soft," continued Barrington Erle. "We could not\r\ncommand our men, and were bound to go out. For aught we knew, some\r\nscore of them might have chosen to support Lord de Terrier, and then\r\nwe should have owned ourselves beaten for the time."\r\n\r\n"You were beaten,--hollow," said Miss Fitzgibbon.\r\n\r\n"Then why did Lord de Terrier dissolve?"\r\n\r\n"A Prime Minister is quite right to dissolve in such a position,"\r\nsaid Lord Brentford. "He must do so for the Queen\'s sake. It is his\r\nonly chance."\r\n\r\n"Just so. It is, as you say, his only chance, and it is his right.\r\nHis very possession of power will give him near a score of votes, and\r\nif he thinks that he has a chance, let him try it. We maintain that\r\nhe had no chance, and that he must have known that he had none;--that\r\nif he could not get on with the late House, he certainly could not\r\nget on with a new House. We let him have his own way as far as we\r\ncould in February. We had failed last summer, and if he could get\r\nalong he was welcome. But he could not get along."\r\n\r\n"I must say I think he was right to dissolve," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"And we are right to force the consequences upon him as quickly as\r\nwe can. He practically lost nine seats by his dissolution. Look at\r\nLoughshane."\r\n\r\n"Yes; look at Loughshane," said Miss Fitzgibbon. "The country at any\r\nrate has gained something there."\r\n\r\n"It\'s an ill wind that blows nobody any good, Mr. Finn," said the\r\nEarl.\r\n\r\n"What on earth is to become of poor George?" said Mr. Fitzgibbon. "I\r\nwonder whether any one knows where he is. George wasn\'t a bad sort of\r\nfellow."\r\n\r\n"Roby used to think that he was a very bad fellow," said Mr. Bonteen.\r\n"Roby used to swear that it was hopeless trying to catch him." It may\r\nbe as well to explain that Mr. Roby was a Conservative gentleman of\r\ngreat fame who had for years acted as Whip under Mr. Daubeny, and who\r\nnow filled the high office of Patronage Secretary to the Treasury. "I\r\nbelieve in my heart," continued Mr. Bonteen, "that Roby is rejoiced\r\nthat poor George Morris should be out in the cold."\r\n\r\n"If seats were halveable, he should share mine, for the sake of auld\r\nlang syne," said Laurence Fitzgibbon.\r\n\r\n"But not to-morrow night," said Barrington Erle; "the division\r\nto-morrow will be a thing not to be joked with. Upon my word I think\r\nthey\'re right about old Moody. All private considerations should give\r\nway. And as for Gunning, I\'d have him up or I\'d know the reason why."\r\n\r\n"And shall we have no defaulters, Barrington?" asked Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not going to boast, but I don\'t know of one for whom we need\r\nblush. Sir Everard Powell is so bad with gout that he can\'t even bear\r\nany one to look at him, but Ratler says that he\'ll bring him up." Mr.\r\nRatler was in those days the Whip on the liberal side of the House.\r\n\r\n"Unfortunate wretch!" said Miss Fitzgibbon.\r\n\r\n"The worst of it is that he screams in his paroxysms," said Mr.\r\nBonteen.\r\n\r\n"And you mean to say that you\'ll take him into the lobby," said Lady\r\nLaura.\r\n\r\n"Undoubtedly," said Barrington Erle. "Why not? He has no business\r\nwith a seat if he can\'t vote. But Sir Everard is a good man, and\r\nhe\'ll be there if laudanum and bath-chair make it possible."\r\n\r\nThe same kind of conversation went on during the whole of dinner, and\r\nbecame, if anything, more animated when the three ladies had left the\r\nroom. Mr. Kennedy made but one remark, and then he observed that as\r\nfar as he could see a majority of nineteen would be as serviceable\r\nas a majority of twenty. This he said in a very mild voice, and in\r\na tone that was intended to be expressive of doubt; but in spite of\r\nhis humility Barrington Erle flew at him almost savagely,--as though\r\na liberal member of the House of Commons was disgraced by so mean a\r\nspirit; and Phineas found himself despising the man for his want of\r\nzeal.\r\n\r\n"If we are to beat them, let us beat them well," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Let there be no doubt about it," said Barrington Erle.\r\n\r\n"I should like to see every man with a seat polled," said Bonteen.\r\n\r\n"Poor Sir Everard!" said Lord Brentford. "It will kill him, no doubt,\r\nbut I suppose the seat is safe."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; Llanwrwsth is quite safe," said Barrington, in his\r\neagerness omitting to catch Lord Brentford\'s grim joke.\r\n\r\nPhineas went up into the drawing-room for a few minutes after dinner,\r\nand was eagerly desirous of saying a few more words,--he knew not\r\nwhat words,--to Lady Laura. Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Bonteen had left\r\nthe dining-room first, and Phineas again found Mr. Kennedy standing\r\nclose to Lady Laura\'s shoulder. Could it be possible that there was\r\nanything in it? Mr. Kennedy was an unmarried man, with an immense\r\nfortune, a magnificent place, a seat in Parliament, and was not\r\nperhaps above forty years of age. There could be no reason why he\r\nshould not ask Lady Laura to be his wife,--except, indeed, that he\r\ndid not seem to have sufficient words at command to ask anybody for\r\nanything. But could it be that such a woman as Lady Laura could\r\naccept such a man as Mr. Kennedy because of his wealth, and because\r\nof his fine place,--a man who had not a word to throw to a dog, who\r\ndid not seem to be possessed of an idea, who hardly looked like a\r\ngentleman;--so Phineas told himself. But in truth Mr. Kennedy, though\r\nhe was a plain, unattractive man, with nothing in his personal\r\nappearance to call for remark, was not unlike a gentleman in his\r\nusual demeanour. Phineas himself, it may be here said, was six feet\r\nhigh, and very handsome, with bright blue eyes, and brown wavy hair,\r\nand light silken beard. Mrs. Low had told her husband more than once\r\nthat he was much too handsome to do any good. Mr. Low, however, had\r\nreplied that young Finn had never shown himself to be conscious of\r\nhis own personal advantages. "He\'ll learn it soon enough," said Mrs.\r\nLow. "Some woman will tell him, and then he\'ll be spoilt." I do not\r\nthink that Phineas depended much as yet on his own good looks, but\r\nhe felt that Mr. Kennedy ought to be despised by such a one as Lady\r\nLaura Standish, because his looks were not good. And she must despise\r\nhim! It could not be that a woman so full of life should be willing\r\nto put up with a man who absolutely seemed to have no life within\r\nhim. And yet why was he there, and why was he allowed to hang about\r\njust over her shoulders? Phineas Finn began to feel himself to be an\r\ninjured man.\r\n\r\nBut Lady Laura had the power of dispelling instantly this sense of\r\ninjury. She had done it effectually in the dining-room by calling him\r\nto the seat by her side, to the express exclusion of the millionaire,\r\nand she did it again now by walking away from Mr. Kennedy to the spot\r\non which Phineas had placed himself somewhat sulkily.\r\n\r\n"Of course you\'ll be at the club on Friday morning after the\r\ndivision," she said.\r\n\r\n"No doubt."\r\n\r\n"When you leave it, come and tell me what are your impressions, and\r\nwhat you think of Mr. Daubeny\'s speech. There\'ll be nothing done in\r\nthe House before four, and you\'ll be able to run up to me."\r\n\r\n"Certainly I will."\r\n\r\n"I have asked Mr. Kennedy to come, and Mr. Fitzgibbon. I am so\r\nanxious about it, that I want to hear what different people say.\r\nYou know, perhaps, that papa is to be in the Cabinet if there\'s a\r\nchange."\r\n\r\n"Is he indeed?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;--and you\'ll come up?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I will. Do you expect to hear much of an opinion from Mr.\r\nKennedy?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do. You don\'t quite know Mr. Kennedy yet. And you must\r\nremember that he will say more to me than he will to you. He\'s\r\nnot quick, you know, as you are, and he has no enthusiasm on any\r\nsubject;--but he has opinions, and sound opinions too." Phineas\r\nfelt that Lady Laura was in a slight degree scolding him for the\r\ndisrespectful manner in which he had spoken of Mr. Kennedy; and he\r\nfelt also that he had committed himself,--that he had shown himself\r\nto be sore, and that she had seen and understood his soreness.\r\n\r\n"The truth is I do not know him," said he, trying to correct his\r\nblunder.\r\n\r\n"No;--not as yet. But I hope that you may some day, as he is one of\r\nthose men who are both useful and estimable."\r\n\r\n"I do not know that I can use him," said Phineas; "but if you wish\r\nit, I will endeavour to esteem him."\r\n\r\n"I wish you to do both;--but that will all come in due time. I think\r\nit probable that in the early autumn there will be a great gathering\r\nof the real Whig Liberals at Loughlinter;--of those, I mean, who have\r\ntheir heart in it, and are at the same time gentlemen. If it is so,\r\nI should be sorry that you should not be there. You need not mention\r\nit, but Mr. Kennedy has just said a word about it to papa, and a\r\nword from him always means so much! Well;--good-night; and mind you\r\ncome up on Friday. You are going to the club, now, of course. I envy\r\nyou men your clubs more than I do the House;--though I feel that\r\na woman\'s life is only half a life, as she cannot have a seat in\r\nParliament."\r\n\r\nThen Phineas went away, and walked down to Pall Mall with Laurence\r\nFitzgibbon. He would have preferred to take his walk alone, but he\r\ncould not get rid of his affectionate countryman. He wanted to think\r\nover what had taken place during the evening; and, indeed, he did so\r\nin spite of his friend\'s conversation. Lady Laura, when she first saw\r\nhim after his return to London, had told him how anxious her father\r\nwas to congratulate him on his seat, but the Earl had not spoken a\r\nword to him on the subject. The Earl had been courteous, as hosts\r\ncustomarily are, but had been in no way specially kind to him. And\r\nthen Mr. Kennedy! As to going to Loughlinter, he would not do such a\r\nthing,--not though the success of the liberal party were to depend on\r\nit. He declared to himself that there were some things which a man\r\ncould not do. But although he was not altogether satisfied with what\r\nhad occurred in Portman Square, he felt as he walked down arm-in-arm\r\nwith Fitzgibbon that Mr. Low and Mr. Low\'s counsels must be scattered\r\nto the winds. He had thrown the die in consenting to stand for\r\nLoughshane, and must stand the hazard of the cast.\r\n\r\n"Bedad, Phin, my boy, I don\'t think you\'re listening to me at all,"\r\nsaid Laurence Fitzgibbon.\r\n\r\n"I\'m listening to every word you say," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"And if I have to go down to the ould country again this session,\r\nyou\'ll go with me?"\r\n\r\n"If I can I will."\r\n\r\n"That\'s my boy! And it\'s I that hope you\'ll have the chance. What\'s\r\nthe good of turning these fellows out if one isn\'t to get something\r\nfor one\'s trouble?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Bunce\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was three o\'clock on the Thursday night before Mr. Daubeny\'s\r\nspeech was finished. I do not think that there was any truth in the\r\nallegation made at the time, that he continued on his legs an hour\r\nlonger than the necessities of his speech required, in order that\r\nfive or six very ancient Whigs might be wearied out and shrink to\r\ntheir beds. Let a Whig have been ever so ancient and ever so weary,\r\nhe would not have been allowed to depart from Westminster Hall that\r\nnight. Sir Everard Powell was there in his bath-chair at twelve,\r\nwith a doctor on one side of him and a friend on the other, in some\r\npurlieu of the House, and did his duty like a fine old Briton as he\r\nwas. That speech of Mr. Daubeny\'s will never be forgotten by any one\r\nwho heard it. Its studied bitterness had perhaps never been equalled,\r\nand yet not a word was uttered for the saying of which he could be\r\naccused of going beyond the limits of parliamentary antagonism. It is\r\ntrue that personalities could not have been closer, that accusations\r\nof political dishonesty and of almost worse than political cowardice\r\nand falsehood could not have been clearer, that no words in the\r\nlanguage could have attributed meaner motives or more unscrupulous\r\nconduct. But, nevertheless, Mr. Daubeny in all that he said was\r\nparliamentary, and showed himself to be a gladiator thoroughly well\r\ntrained for the arena in which he had descended to the combat. His\r\narrows were poisoned, and his lance was barbed, and his shot was\r\nheated red,--because such things are allowed. He did not poison\r\nhis enemies\' wells or use Greek fire, because those things are not\r\nallowed. He knew exactly the rules of the combat. Mr. Mildmay sat and\r\nheard him without once raising his hat from his brow, or speaking\r\na word to his neighbour. Men on both sides of the House said that\r\nMr. Mildmay suffered terribly; but as Mr. Mildmay uttered no word of\r\ncomplaint to any one, and was quite ready to take Mr. Daubeny by the\r\nhand the next time they met in company, I do not know that any one\r\nwas able to form a true idea of Mr. Mildmay\'s feelings. Mr. Mildmay\r\nwas an impassive man who rarely spoke of his own feelings, and no\r\ndoubt sat with his hat low down over his eyes in order that no\r\nman might judge of them on that occasion by the impression on his\r\nfeatures. "If he could have left off half an hour earlier it would\r\nhave been perfect as an attack," said Barrington Erle in criticising\r\nMr. Daubeny\'s speech, "but he allowed himself to sink into\r\ncomparative weakness, and the glory of it was over before the\r\nend."--Then came the division. The Liberals had 333 votes to 314 for\r\nthe Conservatives, and therefore counted a majority of 19. It was\r\nsaid that so large a number of members had never before voted at any\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\n"I own I\'m disappointed," said Barrington Erle to Mr. Ratler.\r\n\r\n"I thought there would be twenty," said Mr. Ratler. "I never went\r\nbeyond that. I knew they would have old Moody up, but I thought\r\nGunning would have been too hard for them."\r\n\r\n"They say they\'ve promised them both peerages."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--if they remain in. But they know they\'re going out."\r\n\r\n"They must go, with such a majority against them," said Barrington\r\nErle.\r\n\r\n"Of course they must," said Mr. Ratler. "Lord de Terrier wants\r\nnothing better, but it is rather hard upon poor Daubeny. I never saw\r\nsuch an unfortunate old Tantalus."\r\n\r\n"He gets a good drop of real water now and again, and I don\'t pity\r\nhim in the least. He\'s clever of course, and has made his own way,\r\nbut I\'ve always a feeling that he has no business where he is.\r\nI suppose we shall know all about it at Brooks\'s by one o\'clock\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\nPhineas, though it had been past five before he went to bed,--for\r\nthere had been much triumphant talking to be done among liberal\r\nmembers after the division,--was up at his breakfast at Mrs. Bunce\'s\r\nlodgings by nine. There was a matter which he was called upon to\r\nsettle immediately in which Mrs. Bunce herself was much interested,\r\nand respecting which he had promised to give an answer on this very\r\nmorning. A set of very dingy chambers up two pairs of stairs at No.\r\n9, Old Square, Lincoln\'s Inn, to which Mr. Low had recommended him to\r\ntransfer himself and all his belongings, were waiting his occupation,\r\nshould he resolve upon occupying them. If he intended to commence\r\noperations as a barrister, it would be necessary that he should have\r\nchambers and a clerk; and before he had left Mr. Low\'s house on\r\nSunday evening he had almost given that gentleman authority to secure\r\nfor him these rooms at No. 9. "Whether you remain in Parliament or\r\nno, you must make a beginning," Mr. Low had said; "and how are you\r\neven to pretend to begin if you don\'t have chambers?" Mr. Low hoped\r\nthat he might be able to wean Phineas away from his Parliament\r\nbauble;--that he might induce the young barrister to give up his\r\nmadness, if not this session or the next, at any rate before a third\r\nyear had commenced. Mr. Low was a persistent man, liking very much\r\nwhen he did like, and loving very strongly when he did love. He would\r\nhave many a tug for Phineas Finn before he would allow that false\r\nWestminster Satan to carry off the prey as altogether his own. If he\r\ncould only get Phineas into the dingy chambers he might do much!\r\n\r\nBut Phineas had now become so imbued with the atmosphere of politics,\r\nhad been so breathed upon by Lady Laura and Barrington Erle, that\r\nhe could no longer endure the thought of any other life than that\r\nof a life spent among the lobbies. A desire to help to beat the\r\nConservatives had fastened on his very soul, and almost made Mr. Low\r\nodious in his eyes. He was afraid of Mr. Low, and for the nonce would\r\nnot go to him any more;--but he must see the porter at Lincoln\'s Inn,\r\nhe must write a line to Mr. Low, and he must tell Mrs. Bunce that for\r\nthe present he would still keep on her rooms. His letter to Mr. Low\r\nwas as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Great Marlborough Street, May, 186--.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR LOW,\r\n\r\n   I have made up my mind against taking the chambers, and am\r\n   now off to the Inn to say that I shall not want them. Of\r\n   course, I know what you will think of me, and it is very\r\n   grievous to me to have to bear the hard judgment of a man\r\n   whose opinion I value so highly; but, in the teeth of your\r\n   terribly strong arguments, I think that there is something\r\n   to be said on my side of the question. This seat in\r\n   Parliament has come in my way by chance, and I think it\r\n   would be pusillanimous in me to reject it, feeling, as I\r\n   do, that a seat in Parliament confers very great honour. I\r\n   am, too, very fond of politics, and regard legislation as\r\n   the finest profession going. Had I any one dependent on\r\n   me, I probably might not be justified in following the\r\n   bent of my inclination. But I am all alone in the world,\r\n   and therefore have a right to make the attempt. If, after\r\n   a trial of one or two sessions, I should fail in that\r\n   which I am attempting, it will not even then be too late\r\n   to go back to the better way. I can assure you that at any\r\n   rate it is not my intention to be idle.\r\n\r\n   I know very well how you will fret and fume over what I\r\n   say, and how utterly I shall fail in bringing you round to\r\n   my way of thinking; but as I must write to tell you of my\r\n   decision, I cannot refrain from defending myself to the\r\n   best of my ability.\r\n\r\n   Yours always faithfully,\r\n\r\n   PHINEAS FINN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Low received this letter at his chambers, and when he had read\r\nit, he simply pressed his lips closely together, placed the sheet\r\nof paper back in its envelope, and put it into a drawer at his left\r\nhand. Having done this, he went on with what work he had before him,\r\nas though his friend\'s decision were a matter of no consequence to\r\nhim. As far as he was concerned the thing was done, and there should\r\nbe an end of it. So he told himself; but nevertheless his mind was\r\nfull of it all day; and, though he wrote not a word of answer to\r\nPhineas, he made a reply within his own mind to every one of the\r\narguments used in the letter. "Great honour! How can there be honour\r\nin what comes, as he says, by chance? He hasn\'t sense enough to\r\nunderstand that the honour comes from the mode of winning it, and\r\nfrom the mode of wearing it; and that the very fact of his being\r\nmember for Loughshane at this instant simply proves that Loughshane\r\nshould have had no privilege to return a member! No one dependent on\r\nhim! Are not his father and his mother and his sisters dependent on\r\nhim as long as he must eat their bread till he can earn bread of his\r\nown? He will never earn bread of his own. He will always be eating\r\nbread that others have earned." In this way, before the day was\r\nover, Mr. Low became very angry, and swore to himself that he would\r\nhave nothing more to say to Phineas Finn. But yet he found himself\r\ncreating plans for encountering and conquering the parliamentary\r\nfiend who was at present so cruelly potent with his pupil. It was not\r\ntill the third evening that he told his wife that Finn had made up\r\nhis mind not to take chambers. "Then I would have nothing more to say\r\nto him," said Mrs. Low, savagely. "For the present I can have nothing\r\nmore to say to him." "But neither now nor ever," said Mrs. Low, with\r\ngreat emphasis; "he has been false to you." "No," said Mr. Low, who\r\nwas a man thoroughly and thoughtfully just at all points; "he has not\r\nbeen false to me. He has always meant what he has said, when he was\r\nsaying it. But he is weak and blind, and flies like a moth to the\r\ncandle; one pities the poor moth, and would save him a stump of his\r\nwing if it be possible."\r\n\r\nPhineas, when he had written his letter to Mr. Low, started off for\r\nLincoln\'s Inn, making his way through the well-known dreary streets\r\nof Soho, and through St. Giles\'s, to Long Acre. He knew every corner\r\nwell, for he had walked the same road almost daily for the last three\r\nyears. He had conceived a liking for the route, which he might easily\r\nhave changed without much addition to the distance, by passing\r\nthrough Oxford Street and Holborn; but there was an air of business\r\non which he prided himself in going by the most direct passage, and\r\nhe declared to himself very often that things dreary and dingy to the\r\neye might be good in themselves. Lincoln\'s Inn itself is dingy, and\r\nthe Law Courts therein are perhaps the meanest in which Equity ever\r\ndisclosed herself. Mr. Low\'s three rooms in the Old Square, each of\r\nthem brown with the binding of law books and with the dust collected\r\non law papers, and with furniture that had been brown always, and had\r\nbecome browner with years, were perhaps as unattractive to the eye of\r\na young pupil as any rooms which were ever entered. And the study of\r\nthe Chancery law itself is not an alluring pursuit till the mind has\r\ncome to have some insight into the beauty of its ultimate object.\r\nPhineas, during his three years\' course of reasoning on these things,\r\nhad taught himself to believe that things ugly on the outside might\r\nbe very beautiful within; and had therefore come to prefer crossing\r\nPoland Street and Soho Square, and so continuing his travels by the\r\nSeven Dials and Long Acre. His morning walk was of a piece with his\r\nmorning studies, and he took pleasure in the gloom of both. But now\r\nthe taste of his palate had been already changed by the glare of\r\nthe lamps in and about palatial Westminster, and he found that St.\r\nGiles\'s was disagreeable. The ways about Pall Mall and across the\r\nPark to Parliament Street, or to the Treasury, were much pleasanter,\r\nand the new offices in Downing Street, already half built, absorbed\r\nall that interest which he had hitherto been able to take in\r\nthe suggested but uncommenced erection of new Law Courts in the\r\nneighbourhood of Lincoln\'s Inn. As he made his way to the porter\'s\r\nlodge under the great gateway of Lincoln\'s Inn, he told himself that\r\nhe was glad that he had escaped, at any rate for a while, from a life\r\nso dull and dreary. If he could only sit in chambers at the Treasury\r\ninstead of chambers in that old court, how much pleasanter it would\r\nbe! After all, as regarded that question of income, it might well be\r\nthat the Treasury chambers should be the more remunerative, and the\r\nmore quickly remunerative, of the two. And, as he thought, Lady Laura\r\nmight be compatible with the Treasury chambers and Parliament, but\r\ncould not possibly be made compatible with Old Square, Lincoln\'s Inn.\r\n\r\nBut nevertheless there came upon him a feeling of sorrow when the\r\nold man at the lodge seemed to be rather glad than otherwise that\r\nhe did not want the chambers. "Then Mr. Green can have them," said\r\nthe porter; "that\'ll be good news for Mr. Green. I don\'t know what\r\nthe gen\'lemen \'ll do for chambers if things goes on as they\'re\r\ngoing." Mr. Green was welcome to the chambers as far as Phineas was\r\nconcerned; but Phineas felt nevertheless a certain amount of regret\r\nthat he should have been compelled to abandon a thing which was\r\nregarded both by the porter and by Mr. Green as being so desirable.\r\nHe had however written his letter to Mr. Low, and made his promise to\r\nBarrington Erle, and was bound to Lady Laura Standish; and he walked\r\nout through the old gateway into Chancery Lane, resolving that he\r\nwould not even visit Lincoln\'s Inn again for a year. There were\r\ncertain books,--law books,--which he would read at such intervals of\r\nleisure as politics might give him; but within the precincts of the\r\nInns of Court he would not again put his foot for twelve months, let\r\nlearned pundits of the law,--such for instance as Mr. and Mrs.\r\nLow,--say what they might.\r\n\r\nHe had told Mrs. Bunce, before he left his home after breakfast, that\r\nhe should for the present remain under her roof. She had been much\r\ngratified, not simply because lodgings in Great Marlborough Street\r\nare less readily let than chambers in Lincoln\'s Inn, but also because\r\nit was a great honour to her to have a member of Parliament in her\r\nhouse. Members of Parliament are not so common about Oxford Street as\r\nthey are in the neighbourhood of Pall Mall and St. James\'s Square.\r\nBut Mr. Bunce, when he came home to his dinner, did not join as\r\nheartily as he should have done in his wife\'s rejoicing. Mr. Bunce\r\nwas in the employment of certain copying law-stationers in Carey\r\nStreet, and had a strong belief in the law as a profession;--but he\r\nhad none whatever in the House of Commons. "And he\'s given up going\r\ninto chambers?" said Mr. Bunce to his wife.\r\n\r\n"Given it up altogether for the present," said Mrs. Bunce.\r\n\r\n"And he don\'t mean to have no clerk?" said Mr. Bunce.\r\n\r\n"Not unless it is for his Parliament work."\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t no clerks wanted for that, and what\'s worse, there ain\'t\r\nno fees to pay \'em. I\'ll tell you what it is, Jane;--if you don\'t\r\nlook sharp there won\'t be nothing to pay you before long."\r\n\r\n"And he in Parliament, Jacob!"\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t no salary for being in Parliament. There are scores of\r\nthem Parliament gents ain\'t got so much as\'ll pay their dinners for\r\n\'em. And then if anybody does trust \'em, there\'s no getting at \'em\r\nto make \'em pay as there is at other folk."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that our Mr. Phineas will ever be like that, Jacob."\r\n\r\n"That\'s gammon, Jane. That\'s the way as women gets themselves took in\r\nalways. Our Mr. Phineas! Why should our Mr. Phineas be better than\r\nanybody else?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s always acted handsome, Jacob."\r\n\r\n"There was one time he could not pay his lodgings for wellnigh nine\r\nmonths, till his governor come down with the money. I don\'t know\r\nwhether that was handsome. It knocked me about terrible, I know."\r\n\r\n"He always meant honest, Jacob."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that I care much for a man\'s meaning when he runs\r\nshort of money. How is he going to see his way, with his seat in\r\nParliament, and this giving up of his profession? He owes us near a\r\nquarter now."\r\n\r\n"He paid me two months this morning, Jacob; so he don\'t owe a\r\nfarthing."\r\n\r\n"Very well;--so much the better for us. I shall just have a few words\r\nwith Mr. Low, and see what he says to it. For myself I don\'t think\r\nhalf so much of Parliament folk as some do. They\'re for promising\r\neverything before they\'s elected; but not one in twenty of \'em is as\r\ngood as his word when he gets there."\r\n\r\nMr. Bunce was a copying journeyman, who spent ten hours a day in\r\nCarey Street with a pen between his fingers; and after that he would\r\noften spend two or three hours of the night with a pen between his\r\nfingers in Marlborough Street. He was a thoroughly hard-working man,\r\ndoing pretty well in the world, for he had a good house over his\r\nhead, and always could find raiment and bread for his wife and\r\neight children; but, nevertheless, he was an unhappy man because he\r\nsuffered from political grievances, or, I should more correctly say,\r\nthat his grievances were semi-political and semi-social. He had no\r\nvote, not being himself the tenant of the house in Great Marlborough\r\nStreet. The tenant was a tailor who occupied the shop, whereas Bunce\r\noccupied the whole of the remainder of the premises. He was a lodger,\r\nand lodgers were not as yet trusted with the franchise. And he had\r\nideas, which he himself admitted to be very raw, as to the injustice\r\nof the manner in which he was paid for his work. So much a folio,\r\nwithout reference to the way in which his work was done, without\r\nregard to the success of his work, with no questions asked of\r\nhimself, was, as he thought, no proper way of remunerating a man for\r\nhis labours. He had long since joined a Trade Union, and for two\r\nyears past had paid a subscription of a shilling a week towards its\r\nfunds. He longed to be doing some battle against his superiors, and\r\nto be putting himself in opposition to his employers;--not that he\r\nobjected personally to Messrs. Foolscap, Margin, and Vellum, who\r\nalways made much of him as a useful man;--but because some such\r\nantagonism would be manly, and the fighting of some battle would\r\nbe the right thing to do. "If Labour don\'t mean to go to the wall\r\nhimself," Bunce would say to his wife, "Labour must look alive, and\r\nput somebody else there."\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunce was a comfortable motherly woman, who loved her husband\r\nbut hated politics. As he had an aversion to his superiors in the\r\nworld because they were superiors, so had she a liking for them for\r\nthe same reason. She despised people poorer than herself, and thought\r\nit a fair subject for boasting that her children always had meat for\r\ndinner. If it was ever so small a morsel, she took care that they had\r\nit, in order that the boast might be maintained. The world had once\r\nor twice been almost too much for her,--when, for instance, her\r\nhusband had been ill; and again, to tell the truth, for the last\r\nthree months of that long period in which Phineas had omitted to pay\r\nhis bills; but she had kept a fine brave heart during those troubles,\r\nand could honestly swear that the children always had a bit of\r\nmeat, though she herself had been occasionally without it for days\r\ntogether. At such times she would be more than ordinarily meek to\r\nMr. Margin, and especially courteous to the old lady who lodged in\r\nher first-floor drawing-room,--for Phineas lived up two pairs of\r\nstairs,--and she would excuse such servility by declaring that there\r\nwas no knowing how soon she might want assistance. But her husband,\r\nin such emergencies, would become furious and quarrelsome, and would\r\ndeclare that Labour was going to the wall, and that something very\r\nstrong must be done at once. That shilling which Bunce paid weekly to\r\nthe Union she regarded as being absolutely thrown away,--as much so\r\nas though he cast it weekly into the Thames. And she had told him so,\r\nover and over again, making heart-piercing allusions to the eight\r\nchildren and to the bit of meat. He would always endeavour to explain\r\nto her that there was no other way under the sun for keeping Labour\r\nfrom being sent to the wall;--but he would do so hopelessly and\r\naltogether ineffectually, and she had come to regard him as a lunatic\r\nto the extent of that one weekly shilling.\r\n\r\nShe had a woman\'s instinctive partiality for comeliness in a man, and\r\nwas very fond of Phineas Finn because he was handsome. And now she\r\nwas very proud of him because he was a member of Parliament. She\r\nhad heard,--from her husband, who had told her the fact with much\r\ndisgust,--that the sons of Dukes and Earls go into Parliament, and\r\nshe liked to think that the fine young man to whom she talked more\r\nor less every day should sit with the sons of Dukes and Earls. When\r\nPhineas had really brought distress upon her by owing her some thirty\r\nor forty pounds, she could never bring herself to be angry with\r\nhim,--because he was handsome and because he dined out with Lords.\r\nAnd she had triumphed greatly over her husband, who had desired to be\r\nsevere upon his aristocratic debtor, when the money had all been paid\r\nin a lump.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that he\'s any great catch," Bunce had said, when the\r\nprospect of their lodger\'s departure had been debated between them.\r\n\r\n"Jacob," said his wife, "I don\'t think you feel it when you\'ve got\r\npeople respectable about you."\r\n\r\n"The only respectable man I know," said Jacob, "is the man as earns\r\nhis bread; and Mr. Finn, as I take it, is a long way from that yet."\r\n\r\nPhineas returned to his lodgings before he went down to his club, and\r\nagain told Mrs. Bunce that he had altogether made up his mind about\r\nthe chambers. "If you\'ll keep me I shall stay here for the first\r\nsession I daresay."\r\n\r\n"Of course we shall be only too proud, Mr. Finn; and though it mayn\'t\r\nperhaps be quite the place for a member of Parliament--"\r\n\r\n"But I think it is quite the place."\r\n\r\n"It\'s very good of you to say so, Mr. Finn, and we\'ll do our very\r\nbest to make you comfortable. Respectable we are, I may say; and\r\nthough Bunce is a bit rough sometimes--"\r\n\r\n"Never to me, Mrs. Bunce."\r\n\r\n"But he is rough,--and silly, too, with his radical nonsense, paying\r\na shilling a week to a nasty Union just for nothing. Still he means\r\nwell, and there ain\'t a man who works harder for his wife and\r\nchildren;--that I will say of him. And if he do talk politics--"\r\n\r\n"But I like a man to talk politics, Mrs. Bunce."\r\n\r\n"For a gentleman in Parliament of course it\'s proper; but I never\r\ncould see what good it could do to a law-stationer; and when he talks\r\nof Labour going to the wall, I always ask him whether he didn\'t get\r\nhis wages regular last Saturday. But, Lord love you, Mr. Finn, when a\r\nman as is a journeyman has took up politics and joined a Trade Union,\r\nhe ain\'t no better than a milestone for his wife to take and talk to\r\nhim."\r\n\r\nAfter that Phineas went down to the Reform Club, and made one of\r\nthose who were buzzing there in little crowds and uttering their\r\nprophecies as to future events. Lord de Terrier was to go out. That\r\nwas certain. Whether Mr. Mildmay was to come in was uncertain. That\r\nhe would go to Windsor to-morrow morning was not to be doubted; but\r\nit was thought very probable that he might plead his age, and decline\r\nto undertake the responsibility of forming a Ministry.\r\n\r\n"And what then?" said Phineas to his friend Fitzgibbon.\r\n\r\n"Why, then there will be a choice out of three. There is the Duke,\r\nwho is the most incompetent man in England; there is Monk, who is the\r\nmost unfit; and there is Gresham, who is the most unpopular. I can\'t\r\nconceive it possible to find a worse Prime Minister than either of\r\nthe three;--but the country affords no other."\r\n\r\n"And which would Mildmay name?"\r\n\r\n"All of them,--one after the other, so as to make the embarrassment\r\nthe greater." That was Mr. Fitzgibbon\'s description of the crisis;\r\nbut then it was understood that Mr. Fitzgibbon was given to\r\nromancing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nThe News about Mr. Mildmay and Sir Everard\r\n\r\n\r\nFitzgibbon and Phineas started together from Pall Mall for Portman\r\nSquare,--as both of them had promised to call on Lady Laura,--but\r\nFitzgibbon turned in at Brooks\'s as they walked up St. James\'s\r\nSquare, and Phineas went on by himself in a cab. "You should belong\r\nhere," said Fitzgibbon as his friend entered the cab, and Phineas\r\nimmediately began to feel that he would have done nothing till he\r\ncould get into Brooks\'s. It might be very well to begin by talking\r\npolitics at the Reform Club. Such talking had procured for him his\r\nseat at Loughshane. But that was done now, and something more than\r\ntalking was wanted for any further progress. Nothing, as he told\r\nhimself, of political import was managed at the Reform Club. No\r\ninfluence from thence was ever brought to bear upon the adjustment of\r\nplaces under the Government, or upon the arrangement of cabinets. It\r\nmight be very well to count votes at the Reform Club; but after the\r\nvotes had been counted,--had been counted successfully,--Brooks\'s was\r\nthe place, as Phineas believed, to learn at the earliest moment what\r\nwould be the exact result of the success. He must get into Brooks\'s,\r\nif it might be possible for him. Fitzgibbon was not exactly the man\r\nto propose him. Perhaps the Earl of Brentford would do it.\r\n\r\nLady Laura was at home, and with her was sitting--Mr. Kennedy.\r\nPhineas had intended to be triumphant as he entered Lady Laura\'s\r\nroom. He was there with the express purpose of triumphing in the\r\nsuccess of their great party, and of singing a pleasant paean in\r\nconjunction with Lady Laura. But his trumpet was put out of tune at\r\nonce when he saw Mr. Kennedy. He said hardly a word as he gave his\r\nhand to Lady Laura,--and then afterwards to Mr. Kennedy, who chose\r\nto greet him with this show of cordiality.\r\n\r\n"I hope you are satisfied, Mr. Finn," said Lady Laura, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes."\r\n\r\n"And is that all? I thought to have found your joy quite\r\nirrepressible."\r\n\r\n"A bottle of soda-water, though it is a very lively thing when\r\nopened, won\'t maintain its vivacity beyond a certain period, Lady\r\nLaura."\r\n\r\n"And you have had your gas let off already?"\r\n\r\n"Well,--yes; at any rate, the sputtering part of it. Nineteen is very\r\nwell, but the question is whether we might not have had twenty-one."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Kennedy has just been saying that not a single available vote\r\nhas been missed on our side. He has just come from Brooks\'s, and that\r\nseems to be what they say there."\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Kennedy also was a member of Brooks\'s! At the Reform Club\r\nthere certainly had been an idea that the number might have been\r\nswelled to twenty-one; but then, as Phineas began to understand,\r\nnothing was correctly known at the Reform Club. For an accurate\r\nappreciation of the political balance of the day, you must go to\r\nBrooks\'s.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Kennedy must of course be right," said Phineas. "I don\'t\r\nbelong to Brooks\'s myself. But I was only joking, Lady Laura. There\r\nis, I suppose, no doubt that Lord de Terrier is out, and that is\r\neverything."\r\n\r\n"He has probably tendered his resignation," said Mr. Kennedy.\r\n\r\n"That is the same thing," said Phineas, roughly.\r\n\r\n"Not exactly," said Lady Laura. "Should there be any difficulty about\r\nMr. Mildmay, he might, at the Queen\'s request, make another attempt."\r\n\r\n"With a majority of nineteen against him!" said Phineas. "Surely Mr.\r\nMildmay is not the only man in the country. There is the Duke, and\r\nthere is Mr. Gresham,--and there is Mr. Monk." Phineas had at his\r\ntongue\'s end all the lesson that he had been able to learn at the\r\nReform Club.\r\n\r\n"I should hardly think the Duke would venture," said Mr. Kennedy.\r\n\r\n"Nothing venture, nothing have," said Phineas. "It is all very well\r\nto say that the Duke is incompetent, but I do not know that anything\r\nvery wonderful is required in the way of genius. The Duke has held\r\nhis own in both Houses successfully, and he is both honest and\r\npopular. I quite agree that a Prime Minister at the present day\r\nshould be commonly honest, and more than commonly popular."\r\n\r\n"So you are all for the Duke, are you?" said Lady Laura, again\r\nsmiling as she spoke to him.\r\n\r\n"Certainly;--if we are deserted by Mr. Mildmay. Don\'t you think so?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t find it quite so easy to make up my mind as you do. I am\r\ninclined to think that Mr. Mildmay will form a government; and as\r\nlong as there is that prospect, I need hardly commit myself to an\r\nopinion as to his probable successor." Then the objectionable Mr.\r\nKennedy took his leave, and Phineas was left alone with Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"It is glorious;--is it not?" he began, as soon as he found the field\r\nto be open for himself and his own manoeuvring. But he was very\r\nyoung, and had not as yet learned the manner in which he might best\r\nadvance his cause with such a woman as Lady Laura Standish. He was\r\ntelling her too clearly that he could have no gratification in\r\ntalking with her unless he could be allowed to have her all to\r\nhimself. That might be very well if Lady Laura were in love with him,\r\nbut would hardly be the way to reduce her to that condition.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Finn," said she, smiling as she spoke, "I am sure that you did\r\nnot mean it, but you were uncourteous to my friend Mr. Kennedy."\r\n\r\n"Who? I? Was I? Upon my word, I didn\'t intend to be uncourteous."\r\n\r\n"If I had thought you had intended it, of course I could not tell you\r\nof it. And now I take the liberty;--for it is a liberty--"\r\n\r\n"Oh no."\r\n\r\n"Because I feel so anxious that you should do nothing to mar your\r\nchances as a rising man."\r\n\r\n"You are only too kind to me,--always."\r\n\r\n"I know how clever you are, and how excellent are all your instincts;\r\nbut I see that you are a little impetuous. I wonder whether you will\r\nbe angry if I take upon myself the task of mentor."\r\n\r\n"Nothing you could say would make me angry,--though you might make me\r\nvery unhappy."\r\n\r\n"I will not do that if I can help it. A mentor ought to be very old,\r\nyou know, and I am infinitely older than you are."\r\n\r\n"I should have thought it was the reverse;--indeed, I may say that I\r\nknow that it is," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"I am not talking of years. Years have very little to do with the\r\ncomparative ages of men and women. A woman at forty is quite old,\r\nwhereas a man at forty is young." Phineas, remembering that he had\r\nput down Mr. Kennedy\'s age as forty in his own mind, frowned when\r\nhe heard this, and walked about the room in displeasure. "And\r\ntherefore," continued Lady Laura, "I talk to you as though I were a\r\nkind of grandmother."\r\n\r\n"You shall be my great-grandmother if you will only be kind enough to\r\nme to say what you really think."\r\n\r\n"You must not then be so impetuous, and you must be a little\r\nmore careful to be civil to persons to whom you may not take any\r\nparticular fancy. Now Mr. Kennedy is a man who may be very useful to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I do not want Mr. Kennedy to be of use to me."\r\n\r\n"That is what I call being impetuous,--being young,--being a boy. Why\r\nshould not Mr. Kennedy be of use to you as well as any one else? You\r\ndo not mean to conquer the world all by yourself."\r\n\r\n"No;--but there is something mean to me in the expressed idea that\r\nI should make use of any man,--and more especially of a man whom I\r\ndon\'t like."\r\n\r\n"And why do you not like him, Mr. Finn?"\r\n\r\n"Because he is one of my Dr. Fells."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t like him simply because he does not talk much. That\r\nmay be a good reason why you should not make of him an intimate\r\ncompanion,--because you like talkative people; but it should be no\r\nground for dislike."\r\n\r\nPhineas paused for a moment before he answered her, thinking whether\r\nor not it would be well to ask her some question which might produce\r\nfrom her a truth which he would not like to hear. Then he did ask it.\r\n"And do you like him?" he said.\r\n\r\nShe too paused, but only for a second. "Yes,--I think I may say that\r\nI do like him."\r\n\r\n"No more than that?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly no more than that;--but that I think is a great deal."\r\n\r\n"I wonder what you would say if any one asked you whether you liked\r\nme," said Phineas, looking away from her through the window.\r\n\r\n"Just the same;--but without the doubt, if the person who questioned\r\nme had any right to ask the question. There are not above one or two\r\nwho could have such a right."\r\n\r\n"And I was wrong, of course, to ask it about Mr. Kennedy," said\r\nPhineas, looking out into the Square.\r\n\r\n"I did not say so."\r\n\r\n"But I see you think it."\r\n\r\n"You see nothing of the kind. I was quite willing to be asked the\r\nquestion by you, and quite willing to answer it. Mr. Kennedy is a man\r\nof great wealth."\r\n\r\n"What can that have to do with it?"\r\n\r\n"Wait a moment, you impetuous Irish boy, and hear me out." Phineas\r\nliked being called an impetuous Irish boy, and came close to her,\r\nsitting where he could look up into her face; and there came a smile\r\nupon his own, and he was very handsome. "I say that he is a man of\r\ngreat wealth," continued Lady Laura; "and as wealth gives influence,\r\nhe is of great use,--politically,--to the party to which he belongs."\r\n\r\n"Oh, politically!"\r\n\r\n"Am I to suppose you care nothing for politics? To such men, to men\r\nwho think as you think, who are to sit on the same benches with\r\nyourself, and go into the same lobby and be seen at the same club,\r\nit is your duty to be civil both for your own sake and for that of\r\nthe cause. It is for the hermits of society to indulge in personal\r\ndislikings,--for men who have never been active and never mean to be\r\nactive. I had been telling Mr. Kennedy how much I thought of you,--as\r\na good Liberal."\r\n\r\n"And I came in and spoilt it all."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you did. You knocked down my little house, and I must build it\r\nall up again."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t trouble yourself, Lady Laura."\r\n\r\n"I shall. It will be a great deal of trouble,--a great deal, indeed;\r\nbut I shall take it. I mean you to be very intimate with Mr. Kennedy,\r\nand to shoot his grouse, and to stalk his deer, and to help to\r\nkeep him in progress as a liberal member of Parliament. I am quite\r\nprepared to admit, as a friend, that he would go back without some\r\nsuch help."\r\n\r\n"Oh;--I understand."\r\n\r\n"I do not believe that you do understand at all, but I must endeavour\r\nto make you do so by degrees. If you are to be my political pupil,\r\nyou must at any rate be obedient. The next time you meet Mr. Kennedy,\r\nask him his opinion instead of telling him your own. He has been in\r\nParliament twelve years, and he was a good deal older than you when\r\nhe began." At this moment a side door was opened, and the red-haired,\r\nred-bearded man whom Phineas had seen before entered the room. He\r\nhesitated a moment, as though he were going to retreat again, and\r\nthen began to pull about the books and toys which lay on one of the\r\ndistant tables, as though he were in quest of some article. And he\r\nwould have retreated had not Lady Laura called to him.\r\n\r\n"Oswald," she said, "let me introduce you to Mr. Finn. Mr. Finn, I do\r\nnot think you have ever met my brother, Lord Chiltern." Then the two\r\nyoung men bowed, and each of them muttered something. "Do not be in a\r\nhurry, Oswald. You have nothing special to take you away. Here is Mr.\r\nFinn come to tell us who are all the possible new Prime Ministers. He\r\nis uncivil enough not to have named papa."\r\n\r\n"My father is out of the question," said Lord Chiltern.\r\n\r\n"Of course he is," said Lady Laura, "but I may be allowed my little\r\njoke."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he will at any rate be in the Cabinet," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"I know nothing whatever about politics," said Lord Chiltern.\r\n\r\n"I wish you did," said his sister,--"with all my heart."\r\n\r\n"I never did,--and I never shall, for all your wishing. It\'s the\r\nmeanest trade going I think, and I\'m sure it\'s the most dishonest.\r\nThey talk of legs on the turf, and of course there are legs; but what\r\nare they to the legs in the House? I don\'t know whether you are in\r\nParliament, Mr. Finn."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am; but do not mind me."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon. Of course there are honest men there, and no\r\ndoubt you are one of them."\r\n\r\n"He is indifferent honest,--as yet," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"I was speaking of men who go into Parliament to look after\r\nGovernment places," said Lord Chiltern.\r\n\r\n"That is just what I\'m doing," said Phineas. "Why should not a man\r\nserve the Crown? He has to work very hard for what he earns."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe that the most of them work at all. However, I beg\r\nyour pardon. I didn\'t mean you in particular."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Finn is such a thorough politician that he will never forgive\r\nyou," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I will," said Phineas, "and I\'ll convert him some day. If he\r\ndoes come into the House, Lady Laura, I suppose he\'ll come on the\r\nright side?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll never go into the House, as you call it," said Lord Chiltern.\r\n"But, I\'ll tell you what; I shall be very happy if you\'ll dine with\r\nme to-morrow at Moroni\'s. They give you a capital little dinner at\r\nMoroni\'s, and they\'ve the best Chateau Yquem in London."\r\n\r\n"Do," said Lady Laura, in a whisper. "Oblige me."\r\n\r\nPhineas was engaged to dine with one of the Vice-Chancellors on the\r\nday named. He had never before dined at the house of this great law\r\nluminary, whose acquaintance he had made through Mr. Low, and he had\r\nthought a great deal of the occasion. Mrs. Freemantle had sent him\r\nthe invitation nearly a fortnight ago, and he understood there was to\r\nbe an elaborate dinner party. He did not know it for a fact, but he\r\nwas in hopes of meeting the expiring Lord Chancellor. He considered\r\nit to be his duty never to throw away such a chance. He would in\r\nall respects have preferred Mr. Freemantle\'s dinner in Eaton Place,\r\ndull and heavy though it might probably be, to the chance of Lord\r\nChiltern\'s companions at Moroni\'s. Whatever might be the faults of\r\nour hero, he was not given to what is generally called dissipation\r\nby the world at large,--by which the world means self-indulgence. He\r\ncared not a brass farthing for Moroni\'s Chateau Yquem, nor for the\r\nwondrously studied repast which he would doubtless find prepared for\r\nhim at that celebrated establishment in St. James\'s Street;--not a\r\nfarthing as compared with the chance of meeting so great a man as\r\nLord Moles. And Lord Chiltern\'s friends might probably be just the\r\nmen whom he would not desire to know. But Lady Laura\'s request\r\noverrode everything with him. She had asked him to oblige her, and of\r\ncourse he would do so. Had he been going to dine with the incoming\r\nPrime Minister, he would have put off his engagement at her request.\r\nHe was not quick enough to make an answer without hesitation; but\r\nafter a moment\'s pause he said he should be most happy to dine with\r\nLord Chiltern at Moroni\'s.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right; 7.30 sharp,--only I can tell you you won\'t meet any\r\nother members." Then the servant announced more visitors, and Lord\r\nChiltern escaped out of the room before he was seen by the new\r\ncomers. These were Mrs. Bonteen and Laurence Fitzgibbon, and then Mr.\r\nBonteen,--and after them Mr. Ratler, the Whip, who was in a violent\r\nhurry, and did not stay there a moment, and then Barrington Erle and\r\nyoung Lord James Fitz-Howard, the youngest son of the Duke of St.\r\nBungay. In twenty or thirty minutes there was a gathering of liberal\r\npolitical notabilities in Lady Laura\'s drawing-room. There were two\r\ngreat pieces of news by which they were all enthralled. Mr. Mildmay\r\nwould not be Prime Minister, and Sir Everard Powell was--dead. Of\r\ncourse nothing quite positive could be known about Mr. Mildmay. He\r\nwas to be with the Queen at Windsor on the morrow at eleven o\'clock,\r\nand it was improbable that he would tell his mind to any one before\r\nhe told it to her Majesty. But there was no doubt that he had engaged\r\n"the Duke,"--so he was called by Lord James,--to go down to Windsor\r\nwith him, that he might be in readiness if wanted. "I have learned\r\nthat at home," said Lord James, who had just heard the news from his\r\nsister, who had heard it from the Duchess. Lord James was delighted\r\nwith the importance given to him by his father\'s coming journey.\r\nFrom this, and from other equally well-known circumstances, it was\r\nsurmised that Mr. Mildmay would decline the task proposed to him.\r\nThis, nevertheless, was only a surmise,--whereas the fact with\r\nreference to Sir Everard was fully substantiated. The gout had flown\r\nto his stomach, and he was dead. "By ---- yes; as dead as a herring,"\r\nsaid Mr. Ratler, who at that moment, however, was not within hearing\r\nof either of the ladies present. And then he rubbed his hands, and\r\nlooked as though he were delighted. And he was delighted,--not\r\nbecause his old friend Sir Everard was dead, but by the excitement\r\nof the tragedy. "Having done so good a deed in his last moments,"\r\nsaid Laurence Fitzgibbon, "we may take it for granted that he will\r\ngo straight to heaven." "I hope there will be no crowner\'s quest,\r\nRatler," said Mr. Bonteen; "if there is I don\'t know how you\'ll\r\nget out of it." "I don\'t see anything in it so horrible," said\r\nMr. Ratler. "If a fellow dies leading his regiment we don\'t think\r\nanything of it. Sir Everard\'s vote was of more service to his country\r\nthan anything that a colonel or a captain can do." But nevertheless\r\nI think that Mr. Ratler was somewhat in dread of future newspaper\r\nparagraphs, should it be found necessary to summon a coroner\'s\r\ninquisition to sit upon poor Sir Everard.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on Lady Laura took Phineas apart for a moment.\r\n"I am so much obliged to you; I am indeed," she said.\r\n\r\n"What nonsense!"\r\n\r\n"Never mind whether it\'s nonsense or not;--but I am. I can\'t explain\r\nit all now, but I do so want you to know my brother. You may be of\r\nthe greatest service to him,--of the very greatest. He is not half so\r\nbad as people say he is. In many ways he is very good,--very good.\r\nAnd he is very clever."\r\n\r\n"At any rate I will think and believe no ill of him."\r\n\r\n"Just so;--do not believe evil of him,--not more evil than you see. I\r\nam so anxious,--so very anxious to try to put him on his legs, and I\r\nfind it so difficult to get any connecting link with him. Papa will\r\nnot speak with him,--because of money."\r\n\r\n"But he is friends with you."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I think he loves me. I saw how distasteful it was to you to go\r\nto him;--and probably you were engaged?"\r\n\r\n"One can always get off those sort of things if there is an object."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--just so. And the object was to oblige me;--was it not?"\r\n\r\n"Of course it was. But I must go now. We are to hear Daubeny\'s\r\nstatement at four, and I would not miss it for worlds."\r\n\r\n"I wonder whether you would go abroad with my brother in the autumn?\r\nBut I have no right to think of such a thing;--have I? At any rate\r\nI will not think of it yet. Good-bye,--I shall see you perhaps on\r\nSunday if you are in town."\r\n\r\nPhineas walked down to Westminster with his mind very full of Lady\r\nLaura and Lord Chiltern. What did she mean by her affectionate\r\nmanner to himself, and what did she mean by the continual praises\r\nwhich she lavished upon Mr. Kennedy? Of whom was she thinking most,\r\nof Mr. Kennedy, or of him? She had called herself his mentor. Was\r\nthe description of her feelings towards himself, as conveyed in that\r\nname, of a kind to be gratifying to him? No;--he thought not. But\r\nthen might it not be within his power to change the nature of those\r\nfeelings? She was not in love with him at present. He could not make\r\nany boast to himself on that head. But it might be within his power\r\nto compel her to love him. The female mentor might be softened. That\r\nshe could not love Mr. Kennedy, he thought that he was quite sure.\r\nThere was nothing like love in her manner to Mr. Kennedy. As to Lord\r\nChiltern, Phineas would do whatever might be in his power. All that\r\nhe really knew of Lord Chiltern was that he had gambled and that he\r\nhad drunk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nThe New Government\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the House of Lords that night, and in the House of Commons, the\r\noutgoing Ministers made their explanations. As our business at the\r\npresent moment is with the Commons, we will confine ourselves to\r\ntheir chamber, and will do so the more willingly because the upshot\r\nof what was said in the two places was the same. The outgoing\r\nministers were very grave, very self-laudatory, and very courteous.\r\nIn regard to courtesy it may be declared that no stranger to the\r\nways of the place could have understood how such soft words could be\r\nspoken by Mr. Daubeny, beaten, so quickly after the very sharp words\r\nwhich he had uttered when he only expected to be beaten. He announced\r\nto his fellow-commoners that his right honourable friend and\r\ncolleague Lord de Terrier had thought it right to retire from the\r\nTreasury. Lord de Terrier, in constitutional obedience to the vote\r\nof the Lower House, had resigned, and the Queen had been graciously\r\npleased to accept Lord de Terrier\'s resignation. Mr. Daubeny could\r\nonly inform the House that her Majesty had signified her pleasure\r\nthat Mr. Mildmay should wait upon her to-morrow at eleven o\'clock.\r\nMr. Mildmay,--so Mr. Daubeny understood,--would be with her Majesty\r\nto-morrow at that hour. Lord de Terrier had found it to be his duty\r\nto recommend her Majesty to send for Mr. Mildmay. Such was the real\r\nimport of Mr. Daubeny\'s speech. That further portion of it in which\r\nhe explained with blandest, most beneficent, honey-flowing words that\r\nhis party would have done everything that the country could require\r\nof any party, had the House allowed it to remain on the Treasury\r\nbenches for a month or two,--and explained also that his party would\r\nnever recriminate, would never return evil for evil, would in no wise\r\ncopy the factious opposition of their adversaries; that his party\r\nwould now, as it ever had done, carry itself with the meekness of\r\nthe dove, and the wisdom of the serpent,--all this, I say, was so\r\ngenerally felt by gentlemen on both sides of the House to be "leather\r\nand prunella" that very little attention was paid to it. The great\r\npoint was that Lord de Terrier had resigned, and that Mr. Mildmay had\r\nbeen summoned to Windsor.\r\n\r\nThe Queen had sent for Mr. Mildmay in compliance with advice given\r\nto her by Lord de Terrier. And yet Lord de Terrier and his first\r\nlieutenant had used all the most practised efforts of their eloquence\r\nfor the last three days in endeavouring to make their countrymen\r\nbelieve that no more unfitting Minister than Mr. Mildmay ever\r\nattempted to hold the reins of office! Nothing had been too bad\r\nfor them to say of Mr. Mildmay,--and yet, in the very first moment\r\nin which they found themselves unable to carry on the Government\r\nthemselves, they advised the Queen to send for that most incompetent\r\nand baneful statesman! We who are conversant with our own methods of\r\npolitics, see nothing odd in this, because we are used to it; but\r\nsurely in the eyes of strangers our practice must be very singular.\r\nThere is nothing like it in any other country,--nothing as yet.\r\nNowhere else is there the same good-humoured, affectionate,\r\nprize-fighting ferocity in politics. The leaders of our two great\r\nparties are to each other exactly as are the two champions of the\r\nring who knock each other about for the belt and for five hundred\r\npounds a side once in every two years. How they fly at each other,\r\nstriking as though each blow should carry death if it were but\r\npossible! And yet there is no one whom the Birmingham Bantam\r\nrespects so highly as he does Bill Burns the Brighton Bully, or with\r\nwhom he has so much delight in discussing the merits of a pot of\r\nhalf-and-half. And so it was with Mr. Daubeny and Mr. Mildmay. In\r\nprivate life Mr. Daubeny almost adulated his elder rival,--and Mr.\r\nMildmay never omitted an opportunity of taking Mr. Daubeny warmly by\r\nthe hand. It is not so in the United States. There the same political\r\nenmity exists, but the political enmity produces private hatred. The\r\nleaders of parties there really mean what they say when they abuse\r\neach other, and are in earnest when they talk as though they were\r\nabout to tear each other limb from limb. I doubt whether Mr. Daubeny\r\nwould have injured a hair of Mr. Mildmay\'s venerable head, even for\r\nan assurance of six continued months in office.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Daubeny had completed his statement, Mr. Mildmay simply told\r\nthe House that he had received and would obey her Majesty\'s commands.\r\nThe House would of course understand that he by no means meant to\r\naver that the Queen would even commission him to form a Ministry. But\r\nif he took no such command from her Majesty it would become his duty\r\nto recommend her Majesty to impose the task upon some other person.\r\nThen everything was said that had to be said, and members returned to\r\ntheir clubs. A certain damp was thrown over the joy of some excitable\r\nLiberals by tidings which reached the House during Mr. Daubeny\'s\r\nspeech. Sir Everard Powell was no more dead than was Mr. Daubeny\r\nhimself. Now it is very unpleasant to find that your news is untrue,\r\nwhen you have been at great pains to disseminate it. "Oh, but he is\r\ndead," said Mr. Ratler. "Lady Powell assured me half an hour ago,"\r\nsaid Mr. Ratler\'s opponent, "that he was at that moment a great deal\r\nbetter than he had been for the last three months. The journey down\r\nto the House did him a world of good." "Then we\'ll have him down for\r\nevery division," said Mr. Ratler.\r\n\r\nThe political portion of London was in a ferment for the next five\r\ndays. On the Sunday morning it was known that Mr. Mildmay had\r\ndeclined to put himself at the head of a liberal Government. He and\r\nthe Duke of St. Bungay, and Mr. Plantagenet Palliser, had been in\r\nconference so often, and so long, that it may almost be said they\r\nlived together in conference. Then Mr. Gresham had been with Mr.\r\nMildmay,--and Mr. Monk also. At the clubs it was said by many that\r\nMr. Monk had been with Mr. Mildmay; but it was also said very\r\nvehemently by others that no such interview had taken place. Mr. Monk\r\nwas a Radical, much admired by the people, sitting in Parliament for\r\nthat most Radical of all constituencies, the Pottery Hamlets, who\r\nhad never as yet been in power. It was the great question of the day\r\nwhether Mr. Mildmay would or would not ask Mr. Monk to join him; and\r\nit was said by those who habitually think at every period of change\r\nthat the time has now come in which the difficulties to forming a\r\ngovernment will at last be found to be insuperable, that Mr. Mildmay\r\ncould not succeed either with Mr. Monk or without him. There were at\r\nthe present moment two sections of these gentlemen,--the section\r\nwhich declared that Mr. Mildmay had sent for Mr. Monk, and the\r\nsection which declared that he had not. But there were others, who\r\nperhaps knew better what they were saying, by whom it was asserted\r\nthat the whole difficulty lay with Mr. Gresham. Mr. Gresham was\r\nwilling to serve with Mr. Mildmay,--with certain stipulations as\r\nto the special seat in the Cabinet which he himself was to occupy,\r\nand as to the introduction of certain friends of his own; but,--so\r\nsaid these gentlemen who were supposed really to understand the\r\nmatter,--Mr. Gresham was not willing to serve with the Duke and with\r\nMr. Palliser. Now, everybody who knew anything knew that the Duke\r\nand Mr. Palliser were indispensable to Mr. Mildmay. And a liberal\r\nGovernment, with Mr. Gresham in the opposition, could not live half\r\nthrough a session! All Sunday and Monday these things were discussed;\r\nand on the Monday Lord de Terrier absolutely stated to the Upper\r\nHouse that he had received her Majesty\'s commands to form another\r\ngovernment. Mr. Daubeny, in half a dozen most modest words,--in words\r\nhardly audible, and most unlike himself,--made his statement in the\r\nLower House to the same effect. Then Mr. Ratler, and Mr. Bonteen, and\r\nMr. Barrington Erle, and Mr. Laurence Fitzgibbon aroused themselves\r\nand swore that such things could not be. Should the prey which they\r\nhad won for themselves, the spoil of their bows and arrows, be\r\nsnatched from out of their very mouths by treachery? Lord de Terrier\r\nand Mr. Daubeny could not venture even to make another attempt unless\r\nthey did so in combination with Mr. Gresham. Such a combination, said\r\nMr. Barrington Erle, would be disgraceful to both parties, but would\r\nprove Mr. Gresham to be as false as Satan himself. Early on the\r\nTuesday morning, when it was known that Mr. Gresham had been at Lord\r\nde Terrier\'s house, Barrington Erle was free to confess that he had\r\nalways been afraid of Mr. Gresham. "I have felt for years," said he,\r\n"that if anybody could break up the party it would be Mr. Gresham."\r\n\r\nOn that Tuesday morning Mr. Gresham certainly was with Lord de\r\nTerrier, but nothing came of it. Mr. Gresham was either not enough\r\nlike Satan for the occasion, or else he was too closely like him.\r\nLord de Terrier did not bid high enough, or else Mr. Gresham did not\r\nlike biddings from that quarter. Nothing then came from this attempt,\r\nand on the Tuesday afternoon the Queen again sent for Mr. Mildmay. On\r\nthe Wednesday morning the gentlemen who thought that the insuperable\r\ndifficulties had at length arrived, began to wear their longest\r\nfaces, and to be triumphant with melancholy forebodings. Now at\r\nlast there was a dead lock. Nobody could form a government. It\r\nwas asserted that Mr. Mildmay had fallen at her Majesty\'s feet\r\ndissolved in tears, and had implored to be relieved from further\r\nresponsibility. It was well known to many at the clubs that the Queen\r\nhad on that morning telegraphed to Germany for advice. There were men\r\nso gloomy as to declare that the Queen must throw herself into the\r\narms of Mr. Monk, unless Mr. Mildmay would consent to rise from his\r\nknees and once more buckle on his ancient armour. "Even that would\r\nbe better than Gresham," said Barrington Erle, in his anger. "I\'ll\r\ntell you what it is," said Ratler, "we shall have Gresham and Monk\r\ntogether, and you and I shall have to do their biddings." Mr.\r\nBarrington Erle\'s reply to that suggestion I may not dare to insert\r\nin these pages.\r\n\r\nOn the Wednesday night, however, it was known that everything had\r\nbeen arranged, and before the Houses met on the Thursday every place\r\nhad been bestowed, either in reality or in imagination. The _Times_,\r\nin its second edition on the Thursday, gave a list of the Cabinet, in\r\nwhich four places out of fourteen were rightly filled. On the Friday\r\nit named ten places aright, and indicated the law officers, with only\r\none mistake in reference to Ireland; and on the Saturday it gave\r\na list of the Under Secretaries of State, and Secretaries and\r\nVice-Presidents generally, with wonderful correctness as to the\r\nindividuals, though the offices were a little jumbled. The Government\r\nwas at last formed in a manner which everybody had seen to be the\r\nonly possible way in which a government could be formed. Nobody was\r\nsurprised, and the week\'s work was regarded as though the regular\r\nroutine of government making had simply been followed. Mr. Mildmay\r\nwas Prime Minister; Mr. Gresham was at the Foreign Office; Mr. Monk\r\nwas at the Board of Trade; the Duke was President of the Council; the\r\nEarl of Brentford was Privy Seal; and Mr. Palliser was Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer. Barrington Erle made a step up in the world, and went\r\nto the Admiralty as Secretary; Mr. Bonteen was sent again to the\r\nAdmiralty; and Laurence Fitzgibbon became a junior Lord of the\r\nTreasury. Mr. Ratler was, of course, installed as Patronage Secretary\r\nto the same Board. Mr. Ratler was perhaps the only man in the party\r\nas to whose destination there could not possibly be a doubt. Mr.\r\nRatler had really qualified himself for a position in such a way as\r\nto make all men feel that he would, as a matter of course, be called\r\nupon to fill it. I do not know whether as much could be said on\r\nbehalf of any other man in the new Government.\r\n\r\nDuring all this excitement, and through all these movements, Phineas\r\nFinn felt himself to be left more and more out in the cold. He had\r\nnot been such a fool as to suppose that any office would be offered\r\nto him. He had never hinted at such a thing to his one dearly\r\nintimate friend, Lady Laura. He had not hitherto opened his mouth in\r\nParliament. Indeed, when the new Government was formed he had not\r\nbeen sitting for above a fortnight. Of course nothing could be done\r\nfor him as yet. But, nevertheless, he felt himself to be out in the\r\ncold. The very men who had discussed with him the question of the\r\ndivision,--who had discussed it with him because his vote was then as\r\ngood as that of any other member,--did not care to talk to him about\r\nthe distribution of places. He, at any rate, could not be one of\r\nthem. He, at any rate, could not be a rival. He could neither mar\r\nnor assist. He could not be either a successful or a disappointed\r\nsympathiser,--because he could not himself be a candidate. The affair\r\nwhich perhaps disgusted him more than anything else was the offer of\r\nan office,--not in the Cabinet, indeed, but one supposed to confer\r\nhigh dignity,--to Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy refused the offer, and\r\nthis somewhat lessened Finn\'s disgust, but the offer itself made him\r\nunhappy.\r\n\r\n"I suppose it was made simply because of his money," he said to\r\nFitzgibbon.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe that," said Fitzgibbon. "People seem to think that\r\nhe has got a head on his shoulders, though he has got no tongue in\r\nit. I wonder at his refusing it because of the Right Honourable."\r\n\r\n"I am so glad that Mr. Kennedy refused," said Lady Laura to him.\r\n\r\n"And why? He would have been the Right Hon. Robert Kennedy for ever\r\nand ever." Phineas when he said this did not as yet know exactly\r\nhow it would have come to pass that such honour,--the honour of the\r\nenduring prefix to his name,--would have come in the way of Mr.\r\nKennedy had Mr. Kennedy accepted the office in question; but he was\r\nvery quick to learn all these things, and, in the meantime, he rarely\r\nmade any mistake about them.\r\n\r\n"What would that have been to him,--with his wealth?" said Lady\r\nLaura. "He has a position of his own and need not care for such\r\nthings. There are men who should not attempt what is called\r\nindependence in Parliament. By doing so they simply decline to make\r\nthemselves useful. But there are a few whose special walk in life it\r\nis to be independent, and, as it were, unmoved by parties."\r\n\r\n"Great Akinetoses! You know Orion," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Kennedy is not an Akinetos," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"He holds a very proud position," said Phineas, ironically.\r\n\r\n"A very proud position indeed," said Lady Laura, in sober earnest.\r\n\r\nThe dinner at Moroni\'s had been eaten, and Phineas had given an\r\naccount of the entertainment to Lord Chiltern\'s sister. There had\r\nbeen only two other guests, and both of them had been men on the\r\nturf. "I was the first there," said Phineas, "and he surprised me\r\never so much by telling me that you had spoken to him of me before."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I did so. I wish him to know you. I want him to know some men\r\nwho think of something besides horses. He is very well educated, you\r\nknow, and would certainly have taken honours if he had not quarrelled\r\nwith the people at Christ Church."\r\n\r\n"Did he take a degree?"\r\n\r\n"No;--they sent him down. It is best always to have the truth among\r\nfriends. Of course you will hear it some day. They expelled him\r\nbecause he was drunk." Then Lady Laura burst out into tears, and\r\nPhineas sat near her, and consoled her, and swore that if in any way\r\nhe could befriend her brother he would do so.\r\n\r\nMr. Fitzgibbon at this time claimed a promise which he said that\r\nPhineas had made to him,--that Phineas would go over with him to Mayo\r\nto assist at his re-election. And Phineas did go. The whole affair\r\noccupied but a week, and was chiefly memorable as being the means of\r\ncementing the friendship which existed between the two Irish members.\r\n\r\n"A thousand a year!" said Laurence Fitzgibbon, speaking of the salary\r\nof his office. "It isn\'t much; is it? And every fellow to whom I owe\r\na shilling will be down upon me. If I had studied my own comfort, I\r\nshould have done the same as Kennedy."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nViolet Effingham\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was now the middle of May, and a month had elapsed since the\r\nterrible difficulty about the Queen\'s Government had been solved. A\r\nmonth had elapsed, and things had shaken themselves into their places\r\nwith more of ease and apparent fitness than men had given them credit\r\nfor possessing. Mr. Mildmay, Mr. Gresham, and Mr. Monk were the best\r\nfriends in the world, swearing by each other in their own house, and\r\nsupported in the other by as gallant a phalanx of Whig peers as ever\r\nwere got together to fight against the instincts of their own order\r\nin compliance with the instincts of those below them. Lady Laura\'s\r\nfather was in the Cabinet, to Lady Laura\'s infinite delight. It\r\nwas her ambition to be brought as near to political action as was\r\npossible for a woman without surrendering any of the privileges of\r\nfeminine inaction. That women should even wish to have votes at\r\nparliamentary elections was to her abominable, and the cause of the\r\nRights of Women generally was odious to her; but, nevertheless, for\r\nherself, she delighted in hoping that she too might be useful,--in\r\nthinking that she too was perhaps, in some degree, politically\r\npowerful; and she had received considerable increase to such hopes\r\nwhen her father accepted the Privy Seal. The Earl himself was not an\r\nambitious man, and, but for his daughter, would have severed himself\r\naltogether from political life before this time. He was an unhappy\r\nman;--being an obstinate man, and having in his obstinacy quarrelled\r\nwith his only son. In his unhappiness he would have kept himself\r\nalone, living in the country, brooding over his wretchedness, were\r\nit not for his daughter. On her behalf, and in obedience to her\r\nrequirements, he came yearly up to London, and, perhaps in compliance\r\nwith her persuasion, had taken some part in the debates of the House\r\nof Lords. It is easy for a peer to be a statesman, if the trouble of\r\nthe life be not too much for him. Lord Brentford was now a statesman,\r\nif a seat in the Cabinet be proof of statesmanship.\r\n\r\nAt this time, in May, there was staying with Lady Laura in Portman\r\nSquare a very dear friend of hers, by name Violet Effingham. Violet\r\nEffingham was an orphan, an heiress, and a beauty; with a terrible\r\naunt, one Lady Baldock, who was supposed to be the dragon who had\r\nViolet, as a captive maiden, in charge. But as Miss Effingham was of\r\nage, and was mistress of her own fortune, Lady Baldock was, in truth,\r\nnot omnipotent as a dragon should be. The dragon, at any rate, was\r\nnot now staying in Portman Square, and the captivity of the maiden\r\nwas therefore not severe at the present moment. Violet Effingham was\r\nvery pretty, but could hardly be said to be beautiful. She was small,\r\nwith light crispy hair, which seemed to be ever on the flutter round\r\nher brows, and which yet was never a hair astray. She had sweet, soft\r\ngrey eyes, which never looked at you long, hardly for a moment,--but\r\nwhich yet, in that half moment, nearly killed you by the power of\r\ntheir sweetness. Her cheek was the softest thing in nature, and the\r\ncolour of it, when its colour was fixed enough to be told, was a\r\nshade of pink so faint and creamy that you would hardly dare to call\r\nit by its name. Her mouth was perfect, not small enough to give that\r\nexpression of silliness which is so common, but almost divine, with\r\nthe temptation of its full, rich, ruby lips. Her teeth, which she but\r\nseldom showed, were very even and very white, and there rested on her\r\nchin the dearest dimple that ever acted as a loadstar to mens\'s eyes.\r\nThe fault of her face, if it had a fault, was in her nose,--which\r\nwas a little too sharp, and perhaps too small. A woman who wanted to\r\ndepreciate Violet Effingham had once called her a pug-nosed puppet;\r\nbut I, as her chronicler, deny that she was pug-nosed,--and all the\r\nworld who knew her soon came to understand that she was no puppet. In\r\nfigure she was small, but not so small as she looked to be. Her feet\r\nand hands were delicately fine, and there was a softness about her\r\nwhole person, an apparent compressibility, which seemed to indicate\r\nthat she might go into very small compass. Into what compass and\r\nhow compressed, there were very many men who held very different\r\nopinions. Violet Effingham was certainly no puppet. She was great\r\nat dancing,--as perhaps might be a puppet,--but she was great also\r\nat archery, great at skating,--and great, too, at hunting. With\r\nreference to that last accomplishment, she and Lady Baldock had had\r\nmore than one terrible tussle, not always with advantage to the\r\ndragon. "My dear aunt," she had said once during the last winter,\r\n"I am going to the meet with George,"--George was her cousin, Lord\r\nBaldock, and was the dragon\'s son,--"and there, let there be an end\r\nof it." "And you will promise me that you will not go further," said\r\nthe dragon. "I will promise nothing to-day to any man or to any\r\nwoman," said Violet. What was to be said to a young lady who spoke in\r\nthis way, and who had become of age only a fortnight since? She rode\r\nthat day the famous run from Bagnall\'s Gorse to Foulsham Common, and\r\nwas in at the death.\r\n\r\nViolet Effingham was now sitting in conference with her friend Lady\r\nLaura, and they were discussing matters of high import,--of very high\r\nimport, indeed,--to the interests of both of them. "I do not ask you\r\nto accept him," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"That is lucky," said the other, "as he has never asked me."\r\n\r\n"He has done much the same. You know that he loves you."\r\n\r\n"I know,--or fancy that I know,--that so many men love me! But, after\r\nall, what sort of love is it? It is just as when you and I, when we\r\nsee something nice in a shop, call it a dear duck of a thing, and\r\ntell somebody to go and buy it, let the price be ever so extravagant.\r\nI know my own position, Laura. I\'m a dear duck of a thing."\r\n\r\n"You are a very dear thing to Oswald."\r\n\r\n"But you, Laura, will some day inspire a grand passion,--or I daresay\r\nhave already, for you are a great deal too close to tell;--and then\r\nthere will be cutting of throats, and a mighty hubbub, and a real\r\ntragedy. I shall never go beyond genteel comedy,--unless I run away\r\nwith somebody beneath me, or do something awfully improper."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t do that, dear."\r\n\r\n"I should like to, because of my aunt. I should indeed. If it were\r\npossible, without compromising myself, I should like her to be told\r\nsome morning that I had gone off with the curate."\r\n\r\n"How can you be so wicked, Violet!"\r\n\r\n"It would serve her right, and her countenance would be so awfully\r\ncomic. Mind, if it is ever to come off, I must be there to see it. I\r\nknow what she would say as well as possible. She would turn to poor\r\nGussy. \'Augusta,\' she would say, \'I always expected it. I always\r\ndid.\' Then I should come out and curtsey to her, and say so prettily,\r\n\'Dear aunt, it was only our little joke.\' That\'s my line. But for\r\nyou,--you, if you planned it, would go off to-morrow with Lucifer\r\nhimself if you liked him."\r\n\r\n"But failing Lucifer, I shall probably be very humdrum."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean that there is anything settled, Laura?"\r\n\r\n"There is nothing settled,--or any beginning of anything that ever\r\ncan be settled, But I am not talking about myself. He has told me\r\nthat if you will accept him, he will do anything that you and I may\r\nask him."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--he will promise."\r\n\r\n"Did you ever know him to break his word?"\r\n\r\n"I know nothing about him, my dear. How should I?"\r\n\r\n"Do not pretend to be ignorant and meek, Violet. You do know\r\nhim,--much better than most girls know the men they marry. You have\r\nknown him, more or less intimately, all your life."\r\n\r\n"But am I bound to marry him because of that accident?"\r\n\r\n"No; you are not bound to marry him,--unless you love him."\r\n\r\n"I do not love him," said Violet, with slow, emphatic words, and a\r\nlittle forward motion of her face, as though she were specially eager\r\nto convince her friend that she was quite in earnest in what she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"I fancy, Violet, that you are nearer to loving him than any other\r\nman."\r\n\r\n"I am not at all near to loving any man. I doubt whether I ever shall\r\nbe. It does not seem to me to be possible to myself to be what girls\r\ncall in love. I can like a man. I do like, perhaps, half a dozen. I\r\nlike them so much that if I go to a house or to a party it is quite\r\na matter of importance to me whether this man or that will or will\r\nnot be there. And then I suppose I flirt with them. At least Augusta\r\ntells me that my aunt says that I do. But as for caring about any one\r\nof them in the way of loving him,--wanting to marry him, and have him\r\nall to myself, and that sort of thing,--I don\'t know what it means."\r\n\r\n"But you intend to be married some day," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"Certainly I do. And I don\'t intend to wait very much longer. I am\r\nheartily tired of Lady Baldock, and though I can generally escape\r\namong my friends, that is not sufficient. I am beginning to think\r\nthat it would be pleasant to have a house of my own. A girl becomes\r\nsuch a Bohemian when she is always going about, and doesn\'t quite\r\nknow where any of her things are."\r\n\r\nThen there was a silence between them for a few minutes. Violet\r\nEffingham was doubled up in a corner of a sofa, with her feet tucked\r\nunder her, and her face reclining upon one of her shoulders. And as\r\nshe talked she was playing with a little toy which was constructed\r\nto take various shapes as it was flung this way or that. A bystander\r\nlooking at her would have thought that the toy was much more to her\r\nthan the conversation. Lady Laura was sitting upright, in a common\r\nchair, at a table not far from her companion, and was manifestly\r\ndevoting herself altogether to the subject that was being discussed\r\nbetween them. She had taken no lounging, easy attitude, she had found\r\nno employment for her fingers, and she looked steadily at Violet as\r\nshe talked,--whereas Violet was looking only at the little manikin\r\nwhich she tossed. And now Laura got up and came to the sofa, and sat\r\nclose to her friend. Violet, though she somewhat moved one foot, so\r\nas to seem to make room for the other, still went on with her play.\r\n\r\n"If you do marry, Violet, you must choose some one man out of the\r\nlot."\r\n\r\n"That\'s quite true, my dear, I certainly can\'t marry them all."\r\n\r\n"And how do you mean to make the choice?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I suppose I shall toss up."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would be in earnest with me."\r\n\r\n"Well;--I will be in earnest. I shall take the first that comes after\r\nI have quite made up my mind. You\'ll think it very horrible, but that\r\nis really what I shall do. After all, a husband is very much like a\r\nhouse or a horse. You don\'t take your house because it\'s the best\r\nhouse in the world, but because just then you want a house. You go\r\nand see a house, and if it\'s very nasty you don\'t take it. But if\r\nyou think it will suit pretty well, and if you are tired of looking\r\nabout for houses, you do take it. That\'s the way one buys one\'s\r\nhorses,--and one\'s husbands."\r\n\r\n"And you have not made up your mind yet?"\r\n\r\n"Not quite. Lady Baldock was a little more decent than usual just\r\nbefore I left Baddingham. When I told her that I meant to have a pair\r\nof ponies, she merely threw up her hands and grunted. She didn\'t\r\ngnash her teeth, and curse and swear, and declare to me that I was a\r\nchild of perdition."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by cursing and swearing?"\r\n\r\n"She told me once that if I bought a certain little dog, it would\r\nlead to my being everlastingly--you know what. She isn\'t so squeamish\r\nas I am, and said it out."\r\n\r\n"What did you do?"\r\n\r\n"I bought the little dog, and it bit my aunt\'s heel. I was very sorry\r\nthen, and gave the creature to Mary Rivers. He was such a beauty! I\r\nhope the perdition has gone with him, for I don\'t like Mary Rivers\r\nat all. I had to give the poor beasty to somebody, and Mary Rivers\r\nhappened to be there. I told her that Puck was connected with\r\nApollyon, but she didn\'t mind that. Puck was worth twenty guineas,\r\nand I daresay she has sold him."\r\n\r\n"Oswald may have an equal chance then among the other favourites?"\r\nsaid Lady Laura, after another pause.\r\n\r\n"There are no favourites, and I will not say that any man may have a\r\nchance. Why do you press me about your brother in this way?"\r\n\r\n"Because I am so anxious. Because it would save him. Because you are\r\nthe only woman for whom he has ever cared, and because he loves you\r\nwith all his heart; and because his father would be reconciled to him\r\nto-morrow if he heard that you and he were engaged."\r\n\r\n"Laura, my dear--"\r\n\r\n"Well."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t be angry if I speak out?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. After what I have said, you have a right to speak\r\nout."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me that all your reasons are reasons why he should marry\r\nme;--not reasons why I should marry him."\r\n\r\n"Is not his love for you a reason?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Violet, pausing,--and speaking the word in the lowest\r\npossible whisper. "If he did not love me, that, if known to me,\r\nshould be a reason why I should not marry him. Ten men may love\r\nme,--I don\'t say that any man does--"\r\n\r\n"He does."\r\n\r\n"But I can\'t marry all the ten. And as for that business of saving\r\nhim--"\r\n\r\n"You know what I mean!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that I have any special mission for saving young men. I\r\nsometimes think that I shall have quite enough to do to save myself.\r\nIt is strange what a propensity I feel for the wrong side of the\r\npost."\r\n\r\n"I feel the strongest assurance that you will always keep on the\r\nright side."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, my dear. I mean to try, but I\'m quite sure that the\r\njockey who takes me in hand ought to be very steady himself. Now,\r\nLord Chiltern--"\r\n\r\n"Well,--out with it. What have you to say?"\r\n\r\n"He does not bear the best reputation in this world as a steady man.\r\nIs he altogether the sort of man that mammas of the best kind are\r\nseeking for their daughters? I like a roue myself;--and a prig who\r\nsits all night in the House, and talks about nothing but church-rates\r\nand suffrage, is to me intolerable. I prefer men who are improper,\r\nand all that sort of thing. If I were a man myself I should go in for\r\neverything I ought to leave alone. I know I should. But you see,--I\'m\r\nnot a man, and I must take care of myself. The wrong side of a post\r\nfor a woman is so very much the wrong side. I like a fast man, but I\r\nknow that I must not dare to marry the sort of man that I like."\r\n\r\n"To be one of us, then,--the very first among us;--would that be the\r\nwrong side?"\r\n\r\n"You mean that to be Lady Chiltern in the present tense, and Lady\r\nBrentford in the future, would be promotion for Violet Effingham in\r\nthe past?"\r\n\r\n"How hard you are, Violet!"\r\n\r\n"Fancy,--that it should come to this,--that you should call me hard,\r\nLaura. I should like to be your sister. I should like well enough to\r\nbe your father\'s daughter. I should like well enough to be Chiltern\'s\r\nfriend. I am his friend. Nothing that any one has ever said of him\r\nhas estranged me from him. I have fought for him till I have been\r\nblack in the face. Yes, I have,--with my aunt. But I am afraid to be\r\nhis wife. The risk would be so great. Suppose that I did not save\r\nhim, but that he brought me to shipwreck instead?"\r\n\r\n"That could not be!"\r\n\r\n"Could it not? I think it might be so very well. When I was a child\r\nthey used to be always telling me to mind myself. It seems to me that\r\na child and a man need not mind themselves. Let them do what they\r\nmay, they can be set right again. Let them fall as they will, you can\r\nput them on their feet. But a woman has to mind herself;--and very\r\nhard work it is when she has a dragon of her own driving her ever the\r\nwrong way."\r\n\r\n"I want to take you from the dragon."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--and to hand me over to a griffin."\r\n\r\n"The truth is, Violet, that you do not know Oswald. He is not a\r\ngriffin."\r\n\r\n"I did not mean to be uncomplimentary. Take any of the dangerous\r\nwild beasts you please. I merely intend to point out that he is a\r\ndangerous wild beast. I daresay he is noble-minded, and I will call\r\nhim a lion if you like it better. But even with a lion there is\r\nrisk."\r\n\r\n"Of course there will be risk. There is risk with every man,--unless\r\nyou will be contented with the prig you described. Of course there\r\nwould be risk with my brother. He has been a gambler."\r\n\r\n"They say he is one still."\r\n\r\n"He has given it up in part, and would entirely at your instance."\r\n\r\n"And they say other things of him, Laura."\r\n\r\n"It is true. He has had paroxysms of evil life which have well-nigh\r\nruined him."\r\n\r\n"And these paroxysms are so dangerous! Is he not in debt?"\r\n\r\n"He is,--but not deeply. Every shilling that he owes would be\r\npaid;--every shilling. Mind, I know all his circumstances, and I\r\ngive you my word that every shilling should be paid. He has never\r\nlied,--and he has told me everything. His father could not leave an\r\nacre away from him if he would, and would not if he could."\r\n\r\n"I did not ask as fearing that. I spoke only of a dangerous habit. A\r\nparoxysm of spending money is apt to make one so uncomfortable. And\r\nthen--"\r\n\r\n"Well."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why I should make a catalogue of your brother\'s\r\nweaknesses."\r\n\r\n"You mean to say that he drinks too much?"\r\n\r\n"I do not say so. People say so. The dragon says so. And as I always\r\nfind her sayings to be untrue, I suppose this is like the rest of\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"It is untrue if it be said of him as a habit."\r\n\r\n"It is another paroxysm,--just now and then."\r\n\r\n"Do not laugh at me, Violet, when I am taking his part, or I shall be\r\noffended."\r\n\r\n"But you see, if I am to be his wife, it is--rather important."\r\n\r\n"Still you need not ridicule me."\r\n\r\n"Dear Laura, you know I do not ridicule you. You know I love you for\r\nwhat you are doing. Would not I do the same, and fight for him down\r\nto my nails if I had a brother?"\r\n\r\n"And therefore I want you to be Oswald\'s wife;--because I know that\r\nyou would fight for him. It is not true that he is a--drunkard. Look\r\nat his hand, which is as steady as yours. Look at his eye. Is there a\r\nsign of it? He has been drunk, once or twice, perhaps,--and has done\r\nfearful things."\r\n\r\n"It might be that he would do fearful things to me."\r\n\r\n"You never knew a man with a softer heart or with a finer spirit. I\r\nbelieve as I sit here that if he were married to-morrow, his vices\r\nwould fall from him like old clothes."\r\n\r\n"You will admit, Laura, that there will be some risk for the wife."\r\n\r\n"Of course there will be a risk. Is there not always a risk?"\r\n\r\n"The men in the city would call this double-dangerous, I think," said\r\nViolet. Then the door was opened, and the man of whom they were\r\nspeaking entered the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nLord Chiltern\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader has been told that Lord Chiltern was a red man, and that\r\npeculiarity of his personal appearance was certainly the first to\r\nstrike a stranger. It imparted a certain look of ferocity to him,\r\nwhich was apt to make men afraid of him at first sight. Women are not\r\nactuated in the same way, and are accustomed to look deeper into men\r\nat the first sight than other men will trouble themselves to do. His\r\nbeard was red, and was clipped, so as to have none of the softness of\r\nwaving hair. The hair on his head also was kept short, and was very\r\nred,--and the colour of his face was red. Nevertheless he was a\r\nhandsome man, with well-cut features, not tall, but very strongly\r\nbuilt, and with a certain curl in the corner of his eyelids which\r\ngave to him a look of resolution,--which perhaps he did not possess.\r\nHe was known to be a clever man, and when very young had had\r\nthe reputation of being a scholar. When he was three-and-twenty\r\ngrey-haired votaries of the turf declared that he would make his\r\nfortune on the race-course,--so clear-headed was he as to odds, so\r\nexcellent a judge of a horse\'s performances, and so gifted with a\r\nmemory of events. When he was five-and-twenty he had lost every\r\nshilling of a fortune of his own, had squeezed from his father more\r\nthan his father ever chose to name in speaking of his affairs to\r\nany one, and was known to be in debt. But he had sacrificed himself\r\non one or two memorable occasions in conformity with turf laws of\r\nhonour, and men said of him, either that he was very honest or very\r\nchivalric,--in accordance with the special views on the subject of\r\nthe man who was speaking. It was reported now that he no longer owned\r\nhorses on the turf;--but this was doubted by some who could name\r\nthe animals which they said that he owned, and which he ran in the\r\nname of Mr. Macnab,--said some; of Mr. Pardoe,--said others; of Mr.\r\nChickerwick,--said a third set of informants. The fact was that Lord\r\nChiltern at this moment had no interest of his own in any horse upon\r\nthe turf.\r\n\r\nBut all the world knew that he drank. He had taken by the throat\r\na proctor\'s bull-dog when he had been drunk at Oxford, had nearly\r\nstrangled the man, and had been expelled. He had fallen through his\r\nviolence into some terrible misfortune at Paris, had been brought\r\nbefore a public judge, and his name and his infamy had been made\r\nnotorious in every newspaper in the two capitals. After that he had\r\nfought a ruffian at Newmarket, and had really killed him with his\r\nfists. In reference to this latter affray it had been proved that the\r\nattack had been made on him, that he had not been to blame, and that\r\nhe had not been drunk. After a prolonged investigation he had come\r\nforth from that affair without disgrace. He would have done so, at\r\nleast, if he had not been heretofore disgraced. But we all know how\r\nthe man well spoken of may steal a horse, while he who is of evil\r\nrepute may not look over a hedge. It was asserted widely by many who\r\nwere supposed to know all about everything that Lord Chiltern was in\r\na fit of delirium tremens when he killed the ruffian at Newmarket.\r\nThe worst of that latter affair was that it produced the total\r\nestrangement which now existed between Lord Brentford and his son.\r\nLord Brentford would not believe that his son was in that matter\r\nmore sinned against than sinning. "Such things do not happen to\r\nother men\'s sons," he said, when Lady Laura pleaded for her brother.\r\nLady Laura could not induce her father to see his son, but so far\r\nprevailed that no sentence of banishment was pronounced against\r\nLord Chiltern. There was nothing to prevent the son sitting at\r\nhis father\'s table if he so pleased. He never did so please,--but\r\nnevertheless he continued to live in the house in Portman Square;\r\nand when he met the Earl, in the hall, perhaps, or on the staircase,\r\nwould simply bow to him. Then the Earl would bow again, and shuffle\r\non,--and look very wretched, as no doubt he was. A grown-up son must\r\nbe the greatest comfort a man can have,--if he be his father\'s best\r\nfriend; but otherwise he can hardly be a comfort. As it was in this\r\nhouse, the son was a constant thorn in his father\'s side.\r\n\r\n"What does he do when we leave London?" Lord Brentford once said to\r\nhis daughter.\r\n\r\n"He stays here, papa."\r\n\r\n"But he hunts still?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he hunts,--and he has a room somewhere at an inn,--down in\r\nNorthamptonshire. But he is mostly in London. They have trains on\r\npurpose."\r\n\r\n"What a life for my son!" said the Earl. "What a life! Of course no\r\ndecent person will let him into his house." Lady Laura did not know\r\nwhat to say to this, for in truth Lord Chiltern was not fond of\r\nstaying at the houses of persons whom the Earl would have called\r\ndecent.\r\n\r\nGeneral Effingham, the father of Violet, and Lord Brentford had been\r\nthe closest and dearest of friends. They had been young men in the\r\nsame regiment, and through life each had confided in the other. When\r\nthe General\'s only son, then a youth of seventeen, was killed in\r\none of our grand New Zealand wars, the bereaved father and the Earl\r\nhad been together for a month in their sorrow. At that time Lord\r\nChiltern\'s career had still been open to hope,--and the one man had\r\ncontrasted his lot with the other. General Effingham lived long\r\nenough to hear the Earl declare that his lot was the happier of the\r\ntwo. Now the General was dead, and Violet, the daughter of a second\r\nwife, was all that was left of the Effinghams. This second wife had\r\nbeen a Miss Plummer, a lady from the city with much money, whose\r\nsister had married Lord Baldock. Violet in this way had fallen to the\r\ncare of the Baldock people, and not into the hands of her father\'s\r\nfriends. But, as the reader will have surmised, she had ideas of her\r\nown of emancipating herself from Baldock thraldom.\r\n\r\nTwice before that last terrible affair at Newmarket, before the\r\nquarrel between the father and the son had been complete, Lord\r\nBrentford had said a word to his daughter,--merely a word,--of his\r\nson in connection with Miss Effingham.\r\n\r\n"If he thinks of it I shall be glad to see him on the subject. You\r\nmay tell him so." That had been the first word. He had just then\r\nresolved that the affair in Paris should be regarded as condoned,--as\r\namong the things to be forgotten. "She is too good for him; but if he\r\nasks her let him tell her everything." That had been the second word,\r\nand had been spoken immediately subsequent to a payment of twelve\r\nthousand pounds made by the Earl towards the settlement of certain\r\nDoncaster accounts. Lady Laura in negotiating for the money had\r\nbeen very eloquent in describing some honest,--or shall we say\r\nchivalric,--sacrifice which had brought her brother into this special\r\ndifficulty. Since that the Earl had declined to interest himself in\r\nhis son\'s matrimonial affairs; and when Lady Laura had once again\r\nmentioned the matter, declaring her belief that it would be the means\r\nof saving her brother Oswald, the Earl had desired her to be silent.\r\n"Would you wish to destroy the poor child?" he had said. Nevertheless\r\nLady Laura felt sure that if she were to go to her father with a\r\npositive statement that Oswald and Violet were engaged, he would\r\nrelent and would accept Violet as his daughter. As for the payment of\r\nLord Chiltern\'s present debts;--she had a little scheme of her own\r\nabout that.\r\n\r\nMiss Effingham, who had been already two days in Portman Square, had\r\nnot as yet seen Lord Chiltern. She knew that he lived in the house,\r\nthat is, that he slept there, and probably eat his breakfast in some\r\napartment of his own;--but she knew also that the habits of the house\r\nwould not by any means make it necessary that they should meet. Laura\r\nand her brother probably saw each other daily,--but they never went\r\ninto society together, and did not know the same sets of people.\r\nWhen she had announced to Lady Baldock her intention of spending the\r\nfirst fortnight of her London season with her friend Lady Laura,\r\nLady Baldock had as a matter of course--"jumped upon her," as Miss\r\nEffingham would herself call it.\r\n\r\n"You are going to the house of the worst reprobate in all England,"\r\nsaid Lady Baldock.\r\n\r\n"What;--dear old Lord Brentford, whom papa loved so well!"\r\n\r\n"I mean Lord Chiltern, who, only last year,--murdered a man!"\r\n\r\n"That is not true, aunt."\r\n\r\n"There is worse than that,--much worse. He is always--tipsy, and\r\nalways gambling, and always-- But it is quite unfit that I should\r\nspeak a word more to you about such a man as Lord Chiltern. His name\r\nought never to be mentioned."\r\n\r\n"Then why did you mention it, aunt?"\r\n\r\nLady Baldock\'s process of jumping upon her niece,--in which I think\r\nthe aunt had generally the worst of the exercise,--went on for some\r\ntime, but Violet of course carried her point.\r\n\r\n"If she marries him there will be an end of everything," said Lady\r\nBaldock to her daughter Augusta.\r\n\r\n"She has more sense than that, mamma," said Augusta.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think she has any sense at all," said Lady Baldock;--"not in\r\nthe least. I do wish my poor sister had lived;--I do indeed."\r\n\r\nLord Chiltern was now in the room with Violet,--immediately upon that\r\nconversation between Violet and his sister as to the expediency of\r\nViolet becoming his wife. Indeed his entrance had interrupted the\r\nconversation before it was over. "I am so glad to see you, Miss\r\nEffingham," he said. "I came in thinking that I might find you."\r\n\r\n"Here I am, as large as life," she said, getting up from her\r\ncorner on the sofa and giving him her hand. "Laura and I have been\r\ndiscussing the affairs of the nation for the last two days, and have\r\nnearly brought our discussion to an end." She could not help looking,\r\nfirst at his eye and then at his hand, not as wanting evidence to\r\nthe truth of the statement which his sister had made, but because\r\nthe idea of a drunkard\'s eye and a drunkard\'s hand had been brought\r\nbefore her mind. Lord Chiltern\'s hand was like the hand of any other\r\nman, but there was something in his eye that almost frightened her.\r\nIt looked as though he would not hesitate to wring his wife\'s neck\r\nround, if ever he should be brought to threaten to do so. And then\r\nhis eye, like the rest of him, was red. No;--she did not think that\r\nshe could ever bring herself to marry him. Why take a venture that\r\nwas double-dangerous, when there were so many ventures open to her,\r\napparently with very little of danger attached to them? "If it should\r\never be said that I loved him, I would do it all the same," she said\r\nto herself.\r\n\r\n"If I did not come and see you here, I suppose that I should never\r\nsee you," said he, seating himself. "I do not often go to parties,\r\nand when I do you are not likely to be there."\r\n\r\n"We might make our little arrangements for meeting," said she,\r\nlaughing. "My aunt, Lady Baldock, is going to have an evening next\r\nweek."\r\n\r\n"The servants would be ordered to put me out of the house."\r\n\r\n"Oh no. You can tell her that I invited you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that Oswald and Lady Baldock are great friends," said\r\nLady Laura.\r\n\r\n"Or he might come and take you and me to the Zoo on Sunday. That\'s\r\nthe proper sort of thing for a brother and a friend to do."\r\n\r\n"I hate that place in the Regent\'s Park," said Lord Chiltern.\r\n\r\n"When were you there last?" demanded Miss Effingham.\r\n\r\n"When I came home once from Eton. But I won\'t go again till I can\r\ncome home from Eton again." Then he altered his tone as he continued\r\nto speak. "People would look at me as if I were the wildest beast in\r\nthe whole collection."\r\n\r\n"Then," said Violet, "if you won\'t go to Lady Baldock\'s or to the\r\nZoo, we must confine ourselves to Laura\'s drawing-room;--unless,\r\nindeed, you like to take me to the top of the Monument."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take you to the top of the Monument with pleasure."\r\n\r\n"What do you say, Laura?"\r\n\r\n"I say that you are a foolish girl," said Lady Laura, "and that I\r\nwill have nothing to do with such a scheme."\r\n\r\n"Then there is nothing for it but that you should come here; and as\r\nyou live in the house, and as I am sure to be here every morning,\r\nand as you have no possible occupation for your time, and as we have\r\nnothing particular to do with ours,--I daresay I shan\'t see you again\r\nbefore I go to my aunt\'s in Berkeley Square."\r\n\r\n"Very likely not," he said.\r\n\r\n"And why not, Oswald?" asked his sister.\r\n\r\nHe passed his hand over his face before he answered her. "Because she\r\nand I run in different grooves now, and are not such meet playfellows\r\nas we used to be once. Do you remember my taking you away right\r\nthrough Saulsby Wood once on the old pony, and not bringing you back\r\ntill tea-time, and Miss Blink going and telling my father?"\r\n\r\n"Do I remember it? I think it was the happiest day in my life. His\r\npockets were crammed full of gingerbread and Everton toffy, and we\r\nhad three bottles of lemonade slung on to the pony\'s saddlebows. I\r\nthought it was a pity that we should ever come back."\r\n\r\n"It was a pity," said Lord Chiltern.\r\n\r\n"But, nevertheless, substantially necessary," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"Failing our power of reproducing the toffy, I suppose it was," said\r\nViolet.\r\n\r\n"You were not Miss Effingham then," said Lord Chiltern.\r\n\r\n"No,--not as yet. These disagreeable realities of life grow upon\r\none; do they not? You took off my shoes and dried them for me at a\r\nwoodman\'s cottage. I am obliged to put up with my maid\'s doing those\r\nthings now. And Miss Blink the mild is changed for Lady Baldock the\r\nmartinet. And if I rode about with you in a wood all day I should\r\nbe sent to Coventry instead of to bed. And so you see everything is\r\nchanged as well as my name."\r\n\r\n"Everything is not changed," said Lord Chiltern, getting up from\r\nhis seat. "I am not changed,--at least not in this, that as I loved\r\nyou better than any being in the world,--better even than Laura\r\nthere,--so do I love you now infinitely the best of all. Do not look\r\nso surprised at me. You knew it before as well as you do now;--and\r\nLaura knows it. There is no secret to be kept in the matter among us\r\nthree."\r\n\r\n"But, Lord Chiltern,--" said Miss Effingham, rising also to her feet,\r\nand then pausing, not knowing how to answer him. There had been a\r\nsuddenness in his mode of addressing her which had, so to say, almost\r\ntaken away her breath; and then to be told by a man of his love\r\nbefore his sister was in itself, to her, a matter so surprising, that\r\nnone of those words came at her command which will come, as though by\r\ninstinct, to young ladies on such occasions.\r\n\r\n"You have known it always," said he, as though he were angry with\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Lord Chiltern," she replied, "you must excuse me if I say that you\r\nare, at the least, very abrupt. I did not think when I was going back\r\nso joyfully to our childish days that you would turn the tables on me\r\nin this way."\r\n\r\n"He has said nothing that ought to make you angry," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"Only because he has driven me to say that which will make me appear\r\nto be uncivil to himself. Lord Chiltern, I do not love you with that\r\nlove of which you are speaking now. As an old friend I have always\r\nregarded you, and I hope that I may always do so." Then she got up\r\nand left the room.\r\n\r\n"Why were you so sudden with her,--so abrupt,--so loud?" said his\r\nsister, coming up to him and taking him by the arm almost in anger.\r\n\r\n"It would make no difference," said he. "She does not care for me."\r\n\r\n"It makes all the difference in the world," said Lady Laura. "Such\r\na woman as Violet cannot be had after that fashion. You must begin\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"I have begun and ended," he said.\r\n\r\n"That is nonsense. Of course you will persist. It was madness to\r\nspeak in that way to-day. You may be sure of this, however, that\r\nthere is no one she likes better than you. You must remember that you\r\nhave done much to make any girl afraid of you."\r\n\r\n"I do remember it."\r\n\r\n"Do something now to make her fear you no longer. Speak to her\r\nsoftly. Tell her of the sort of life which you would live with her.\r\nTell her that all is changed. As she comes to love you, she will\r\nbelieve you when she would believe no one else on that matter."\r\n\r\n"Am I to tell her a lie?" said Lord Chiltern, looking his sister full\r\nin the face. Then he turned upon his heel and left her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nAutumnal Prospects\r\n\r\n\r\nThe session went on very calmly after the opening battle which ousted\r\nLord de Terrier and sent Mr. Mildmay back to the Treasury,--so calmly\r\nthat Phineas Finn was unconsciously disappointed, as lacking that\r\nexcitement of contest to which he had been introduced in the first\r\ndays of his parliamentary career. From time to time certain waspish\r\nattacks were made by Mr. Daubeny, now on this Secretary of State and\r\nnow on that; but they were felt by both parties to mean nothing; and\r\nas no great measure was brought forward, nothing which would serve\r\nby the magnitude of its interests to divide the liberal side of the\r\nHouse into fractions, Mr. Mildmay\'s Cabinet was allowed to hold its\r\nown in comparative peace and quiet. It was now July,--the middle of\r\nJuly,--and the member for Loughshane had not yet addressed the House.\r\nHow often had he meditated doing so; how he had composed his speeches\r\nwalking round the Park on his way down to the House; how he got his\r\nsubjects up,--only to find on hearing them discussed that he really\r\nknew little or nothing about them; how he had his arguments and\r\nalmost his very words taken out of his mouth by some other member;\r\nand lastly, how he had actually been deterred from getting upon his\r\nlegs by a certain tremor of blood round his heart when the moment\r\nfor rising had come,--of all this he never said a word to any man.\r\nSince that last journey to county Mayo, Laurence Fitzgibbon had been\r\nhis most intimate friend, but he said nothing of all this even to\r\nLaurence Fitzgibbon. To his other friend, Lady Laura Standish, he did\r\nexplain something of his feelings, not absolutely describing to her\r\nthe extent of hindrance to which his modesty had subjected him, but\r\nletting her know that he had his qualms as well as his aspirations.\r\nBut as Lady Laura always recommended patience, and more than once\r\nexpressed her opinion that a young member would be better to sit\r\nin silence at least for one session, he was not driven to the\r\nmortification of feeling that he was incurring her contempt by his\r\nbashfulness. As regarded the men among whom he lived, I think he was\r\nalmost annoyed at finding that no one seemed to expect that he should\r\nspeak. Barrington Erle, when he had first talked of sending Phineas\r\ndown to Loughshane, had predicted for him all manner of parliamentary\r\nsuccesses, and had expressed the warmest admiration of the manner in\r\nwhich Phineas had discussed this or that subject at the Union. "We\r\nhave not above one or two men in the House who can do that kind of\r\nthing," Barrington Erle had once said. But now no allusions whatever\r\nwere made to his powers of speech, and Phineas in his modest moments\r\nbegan to be more amazed than ever that he should find himself seated\r\nin that chamber.\r\n\r\nTo the forms and technicalities of parliamentary business he did give\r\nclose attention, and was unremitting in his attendance. On one or two\r\noccasions he ventured to ask a question of the Speaker, and as the\r\nwords of experience fell into his ears, he would tell himself that\r\nhe was going through his education,--that he was learning to be a\r\nworking member, and perhaps to be a statesman. But his regrets with\r\nreference to Mr. Low and the dingy chambers in Old Square were very\r\nfrequent; and had it been possible for him to undo all that he had\r\ndone, he would often have abandoned to some one else the honour of\r\nrepresenting the electors of Loughshane.\r\n\r\nBut he was supported in all his difficulties by the kindness of his\r\nfriend, Lady Laura Standish. He was often in the house in Portman\r\nSquare, and was always received with cordiality, and, as he thought,\r\nalmost with affection. She would sit and talk to him, sometimes\r\nsaying a word about her brother and sometimes about her father, as\r\nthough there were more between them than the casual intimacy of\r\nLondon acquaintance. And in Portman Square he had been introduced to\r\nMiss Effingham, and had found Miss Effingham to be--very nice. Miss\r\nEffingham had quite taken to him, and he had danced with her at two\r\nor three parties, talking always, as he did so, about Lady Laura\r\nStandish.\r\n\r\n"I declare, Laura, I think your friend Mr. Finn is in love with you,"\r\nsaid Violet to Lady Laura one night.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that. He is fond of me, and so am I of him. He is\r\nso honest, and so naive without being awkward! And then he is\r\nundoubtedly clever."\r\n\r\n"And so uncommonly handsome," said Violet.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that that makes much difference," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"I think it does if a man looks like a gentleman as well."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Finn certainly looks like a gentleman," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"And no doubt is one," said Violet. "I wonder whether he has got any\r\nmoney."\r\n\r\n"Not a penny, I should say."\r\n\r\n"How does such a man manage to live? There are so many men like that,\r\nand they are always mysteries to me. I suppose he\'ll have to marry an\r\nheiress."\r\n\r\n"Whoever gets him will not have a bad husband," said Lady Laura\r\nStandish.\r\n\r\nPhineas during the summer had very often met Mr. Kennedy. They sat\r\non the same side of the House, they belonged to the same club, they\r\ndined together more than once in Portman Square, and on one occasion\r\nPhineas had accepted an invitation to dinner sent to him by Mr.\r\nKennedy himself. "A slower affair I never saw in my life," he said\r\nafterwards to Laurence Fitzgibbon. "Though there were two or three\r\nmen there who talk everywhere else, they could not talk at his\r\ntable." "He gave you good wine, I should say," said Fitzgibbon, "and\r\nlet me tell you that that covers a multitude of sins." In spite,\r\nhowever, of all these opportunities for intimacy, now, nearly at\r\nthe end of the session, Phineas had hardly spoken a dozen words to\r\nMr. Kennedy, and really knew nothing whatsoever of the man, as one\r\nfriend,--or even as one acquaintance knows another. Lady Laura had\r\ndesired him to be on good terms with Mr. Kennedy, and for that reason\r\nhe had dined with him. Nevertheless he disliked Mr. Kennedy, and felt\r\nquite sure that Mr. Kennedy disliked him. He was therefore rather\r\nsurprised when he received the following note:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Albany, Z 3, July 17, 186--.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR MR. FINN,\r\n\r\n   I shall have some friends at Loughlinter next month, and\r\n   should be very glad if you will join us. I will name the\r\n   16th August. I don\'t know whether you shoot, but there are\r\n   grouse and deer.\r\n\r\n   Yours truly,\r\n\r\n   ROBERT KENNEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was he to do? He had already begun to feel rather uncomfortable\r\nat the prospect of being separated from all his new friends as soon\r\nas the session should be over. Laurence Fitzgibhon had asked him to\r\nmake another visit to county Mayo, but that he had declined. Lady\r\nLaura had said something to him about going abroad with her brother,\r\nand since that there had sprung up a sort of intimacy between him and\r\nLord Chiltern; but nothing had been fixed about this foreign trip,\r\nand there were pecuniary objections to it which put it almost out of\r\nhis power. The Christmas holidays he would of course pass with his\r\nfamily at Killaloe, but he hardly liked the idea of hurrying off to\r\nKillaloe immediately the session should be over. Everybody around\r\nhim seemed to be looking forward to pleasant leisure doings in the\r\ncountry. Men talked about grouse, and of the ladies at the houses to\r\nwhich they were going and of the people whom they were to meet. Lady\r\nLaura had said nothing of her own movements for the early autumn, and\r\nno invitation had come to him to go to the Earl\'s country house. He\r\nhad already felt that every one would depart and that he would be\r\nleft,--and this had made him uncomfortable. What was he to do with\r\nthe invitation from Mr. Kennedy? He disliked the man, and had told\r\nhimself half a dozen times that he despised him. Of course he must\r\nrefuse it. Even for the sake of the scenery, and the grouse, and the\r\npleasant party, and the feeling that going to Loughlinter in August\r\nwould be the proper sort of thing to do, he must refuse it! But it\r\noccurred to him at last that he would call in Portman Square before\r\nhe wrote his note.\r\n\r\n"Of course you will go," said Lady Laura, in her most decided tone.\r\n\r\n"And why?"\r\n\r\n"In the first place it is civil in him to ask you, and why should you\r\nbe uncivil in return?"\r\n\r\n"There is nothing uncivil in not accepting a man\'s invitation," said\r\nPhineas.\r\n\r\n"We are going," said Lady Laura, "and I can only say that I shall be\r\ndisappointed if you do not go too. Both Mr. Gresham and Mr. Monk will\r\nbe there, and I believe they have never stayed together in the same\r\nhouse before. I have no doubt there are a dozen men on your side of\r\nthe House who would give their eyes to be there. Of course you will\r\ngo."\r\n\r\nOf course he did go. The note accepting Mr. Kennedy\'s invitation was\r\nwritten at the Reform Club within a quarter of an hour of his leaving\r\nPortman Square. He was very careful in writing to be not more\r\nfamiliar or more civil than Mr. Kennedy had been to himself, and\r\nthen he signed himself "Yours truly, Phineas Finn." But another\r\nproposition was made to him, and a most charming proposition, during\r\nthe few minutes that he remained in Portman Square. "I am so glad,"\r\nsaid Lady Laura, "because I can now ask you to run down to us at\r\nSaulsby for a couple of days on your way to Loughlinter. Till this\r\nwas fixed I couldn\'t ask you to come all the way to Saulsby for two\r\ndays; and there won\'t be room for more between our leaving London\r\nand starting to Loughlinter." Phineas swore that he would have gone\r\nif it had been but for one hour, and if Saulsby had been twice the\r\ndistance. "Very well; come on the 13th and go on the 15th. You must\r\ngo on the 15th, unless you choose to stay with the housekeeper.\r\nAnd remember, Mr. Finn, we have got no grouse at Saulsby." Phineas\r\ndeclared that he did not care a straw for grouse.\r\n\r\nThere was another little occurrence which happened before Phineas\r\nleft London, and which was not altogether so charming as his\r\nprospects at Saulsby and Loughlinter. Early in August, when the\r\nsession was still incomplete, he dined with Laurence Fitzgibbon at\r\nthe Reform Club. Laurence had specially invited him to do so, and\r\nmade very much of him on the occasion. "By George, my dear fellow,"\r\nLaurence said to him that morning, "nothing has happened to me this\r\nsession that has given me so much pleasure as your being in the\r\nHouse. Of course there are fellows with whom one is very intimate and\r\nof whom one is very fond,--and all that sort of thing. But most of\r\nthese Englishmen on our side are such cold fellows; or else they are\r\nlike Ratler and Barrington Erle, thinking of nothing but politics.\r\nAnd then as to our own men, there are so many of them one can hardly\r\ntrust! That\'s the truth of it. Your being in the House has been such\r\na comfort to me!" Phineas, who really liked his friend Laurence,\r\nexpressed himself very warmly in answer to this, and became\r\naffectionate, and made sundry protestations of friendship which were\r\nperfectly sincere. Their sincerity was tested after dinner, when\r\nFitzgibbon, as they two were seated on a sofa in the corner of the\r\nsmoking-room, asked Phineas to put his name to the back of a bill for\r\ntwo hundred and fifty pounds at six months\' date.\r\n\r\n"But, my dear Laurence," said Phineas, "two hundred and fifty pounds\r\nis a sum of money utterly beyond my reach."\r\n\r\n"Exactly, my dear boy, and that\'s why I\'ve come to you. D\'ye think\r\nI\'d have asked anybody who by any impossibility might have been made\r\nto pay anything for me?"\r\n\r\n"But what\'s the use of it then?"\r\n\r\n"All the use in the world. It\'s for me to judge of the use, you know.\r\nWhy, d\'ye think I\'d ask it if it wasn\'t any use? I\'ll make it of use,\r\nmy boy. And take my word, you\'ll never hear about it again. It\'s just\r\na forestalling of my salary; that\'s all. I wouldn\'t do it till I saw\r\nthat we were at least safe for six months to come." Then Phineas Finn\r\nwith many misgivings, with much inward hatred of himself for his own\r\nweakness, did put his name on the back of the bill which Laurence\r\nFitzgibbon had prepared for his signature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nSaulsby Wood\r\n\r\n\r\n"So you won\'t come to Moydrum again?" said Laurence Fitzgibbon to his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n"Not this autumn, Laurence. Your father would think that I want to\r\nlive there."\r\n\r\n"Bedad, it\'s my father would be glad to see you,--and the oftener the\r\nbetter."\r\n\r\n"The fact is, my time is filled up."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not going to be one of the party at Loughlinter?"\r\n\r\n"I believe I am. Kennedy asked me, and people seem to think that\r\neverybody is to do what he bids them."\r\n\r\n"I should think so too. I wish he had asked me. I should have thought\r\nit as good as a promise of an under-secretaryship. All the Cabinet\r\nare to be there. I don\'t suppose he ever had an Irishman in his house\r\nbefore. When do you start?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--on the 12th or 13th. I believe I shall go to Saulsby on my\r\nway."\r\n\r\n"The devil you will. Upon my word, Phineas, my boy, you\'re the\r\nluckiest fellow I know. This is your first year, and you\'re asked to\r\nthe two most difficult houses in England. You have only to look out\r\nfor an heiress now. There is little Vi Effingham;--she is sure to be\r\nat Saulsby. Good-bye, old fellow. Don\'t you be in the least unhappy\r\nabout the bill. I\'ll see to making that all right."\r\n\r\nPhineas was rather unhappy about the bill; but there was so much that\r\nwas pleasant in his cup at the present moment, that he resolved, as\r\nfar as possible, to ignore the bitter of that one ingredient. He was\r\na little in the dark as to two or three matters respecting these\r\ncoming visits. He would have liked to have taken a servant with him;\r\nbut he had no servant, and felt ashamed to hire one for the occasion.\r\nAnd then he was in trouble about a gun, and the paraphernalia of\r\nshooting. He was not a bad shot at snipe in the bogs of county Clare,\r\nbut he had never even seen a gun used in England. However, he bought\r\nhimself a gun,--with other paraphernalia, and took a license for\r\nhimself, and then groaned over the expense to which he found that his\r\njourney would subject him. And at last he hired a servant for the\r\noccasion. He was intensely ashamed of himself when he had done so,\r\nhating himself, and telling himself that he was going to the devil\r\nheadlong. And why had he done it? Not that Lady Laura would like him\r\nthe better, or that she would care whether he had a servant or not.\r\nShe probably would know nothing of his servant. But the people about\r\nher would know, and he was foolishly anxious that the people about\r\nher should think that he was worthy of her.\r\n\r\nThen he called on Mr. Low before he started. "I did not like to leave\r\nLondon without seeing you," he said; "but I know you will have\r\nnothing pleasant to say to me."\r\n\r\n"I shall say nothing unpleasant certainly. I see your name in the\r\ndivisions, and I feel a sort of envy myself."\r\n\r\n"Any fool could go into a lobby," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"To tell you the truth, I have been gratified to see that you have\r\nhad the patience to abstain from speaking till you had looked about\r\nyou. It was more than I expected from your hot Irish blood. Going\r\nto meet Mr. Gresham and Mr. Monk,--are you? Well, I hope you may\r\nmeet them in the Cabinet some day. Mind you come and see me when\r\nParliament meets in February."\r\n\r\nMrs. Bunce was delighted when she found that Phineas had hired a\r\nservant; but Mr. Bunce predicted nothing but evil from so vain an\r\nexpense. "Don\'t tell me; where is it to come from? He ain\'t no\r\nricher because he\'s in Parliament. There ain\'t no wages. M.P. and\r\nM.T.,"--whereby Mr. Bunce, I fear, meant empty,--"are pretty much\r\nalike when a man hasn\'t a fortune at his back." "But he\'s going to\r\nstay with all the lords in the Cabinet," said Mrs. Bunce, to whom\r\nPhineas, in his pride, had confided perhaps more than was necessary.\r\n"Cabinet, indeed," said Bunce; "if he\'d stick to chambers, and let\r\nalone cabinets, he\'d do a deal better. Given up his rooms, has\r\nhe,--till February? He don\'t expect we\'re going to keep them empty\r\nfor him!"\r\n\r\nPhineas found that the house was full at Saulsby, although the\r\nsojourn of the visitors would necessarily be so short. There\r\nwere three or four there on their way on to Loughlinter, like\r\nhimself,--Mr. Bonteen and Mr. Ratler, with Mr. Palliser, the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, and his wife,--and there was Violet\r\nEffingham, who, however, was not going to Loughlinter. "No, indeed,"\r\nshe said to our hero, who on the first evening had the pleasure\r\nof taking her in to dinner, "unfortunately I haven\'t a seat in\r\nParliament, and therefore I am not asked."\r\n\r\n"Lady Laura is going."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--but Lady Laura has a Cabinet Minister in her keeping. I\'ve\r\nonly one comfort;--you\'ll be awfully dull."\r\n\r\n"I daresay it would be very much nicer to stay here," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"If you want to know my real mind," said Violet, "I would give one of\r\nmy little fingers to go. There will be four Cabinet Ministers in the\r\nhouse, and four un-Cabinet Ministers, and half a dozen other members\r\nof Parliament, and there will be Lady Glencora Palliser, who is the\r\nbest fun in the world; and, in point of fact, it\'s the thing of the\r\nyear. But I am not asked. You see I belong to the Baldock faction,\r\nand we don\'t sit on your side of the House. Mr. Kennedy thinks that I\r\nshould tell secrets."\r\n\r\nWhy on earth had Mr. Kennedy invited him, Phineas Finn, to meet four\r\nCabinet Ministers and Lady Glencora Palliser? He could only have done\r\nso at the instance of Lady Laura Standish. It was delightful for\r\nPhineas to think that Lady Laura cared for him so deeply; but it was\r\nnot equally delightful when he remembered how very close must be\r\nthe alliance between Mr. Kennedy and Lady Laura, when she was thus\r\npowerful with him.\r\n\r\nAt Saulsby Phineas did not see much of his hostess. When they were\r\nmaking their plans for the one entire day of this visit, she said a\r\nsoft word of apology to him. "I am so busy with all these people,\r\nthat I hardly know what I am doing. But we shall be able to find a\r\nquiet minute or two at Loughlinter,--unless, indeed, you intend to\r\nbe on the mountains all day. I suppose you have brought a gun like\r\neverybody else?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I have brought a gun. I do shoot; but I am not an inveterate\r\nsportsman."\r\n\r\nOn that one day there was a great riding party made up, and Phineas\r\nfound himself mounted, after luncheon, with some dozen other\r\nequestrians. Among them were Miss Effingham and Lady Glencora, Mr.\r\nRatler and the Earl of Brentford himself. Lady Glencora, whose\r\nhusband was, as has been said, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and who\r\nwas still a young woman, and a very pretty woman, had taken lately\r\nvery strongly to politics, which she discussed among men and women\r\nof both parties with something more than ordinary audacity. "What a\r\nnice, happy, lazy time you\'ve had of it since you\'ve been in," said\r\nshe to the Earl.\r\n\r\n"I hope we have been more happy than lazy," said the Earl.\r\n\r\n"But you\'ve done nothing. Mr. Palliser has twenty schemes of reform,\r\nall mature; but among you you\'ve not let him bring in one of them.\r\nThe Duke and Mr. Mildmay and you will break his heart among you."\r\n\r\n"Poor Mr. Palliser!"\r\n\r\n"The truth is, if you don\'t take care he and Mr. Monk and Mr. Gresham\r\nwill arise and shake themselves, and turn you all out."\r\n\r\n"We must look to ourselves, Lady Glencora."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, yes;--or you will be known to all posterity as the faineant\r\ngovernment."\r\n\r\n"Let me tell you, Lady Glencora, that a faineant government is not\r\nthe worst government that England can have. It has been the great\r\nfault of our politicians that they have all wanted to do something."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Mildmay is at any rate innocent of that charge," said Lady\r\nGlencora.\r\n\r\nThey were now riding through a vast wood, and Phineas found himself\r\ndelightfully established by the side of Violet Effingham. "Mr. Ratler\r\nhas been explaining to me that he must have nineteen next session.\r\nNow, if I were you, Mr. Finn, I would decline to be counted up in\r\nthat way as one of Mr. Ratler\'s sheep."\r\n\r\n"But what am I to do?"\r\n\r\n"Do something on your own hook. You men in Parliament are so much\r\nlike sheep! If one jumps at a gap, all go after him,--and then you\r\nare penned into lobbies, and then you are fed, and then you are\r\nfleeced. I wish I were in Parliament. I\'d get up in the middle and\r\nmake such a speech. You all seem to me to be so much afraid of one\r\nanother that you don\'t quite dare to speak out. Do you see that\r\ncottage there?"\r\n\r\n"What a pretty cottage it is!"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--is it not? Twelve years ago I took off my shoes and stockings\r\nand had them dried in that cottage, and when I got back to the house\r\nI was put to bed for having been out all day in the wood."\r\n\r\n"Were you wandering about alone?"\r\n\r\n"No, I wasn\'t alone. Oswald Standish was with me. We were children\r\nthen. Do you know him?"\r\n\r\n"Lord Chiltern;--yes, I know him. He and I have been rather friends\r\nthis year."\r\n\r\n"He is very good;--is he not?"\r\n\r\n"Good,--in what way?"\r\n\r\n"Honest and generous!"\r\n\r\n"I know no man whom I believe to be more so."\r\n\r\n"And he is clever?" asked Miss Effingham.\r\n\r\n"Very clever. That is, he talks very well if you will let him talk\r\nafter his own fashion. You would always fancy that he was going to\r\neat you;--but that is his way."\r\n\r\n"And you like him?"\r\n\r\n"Very much."\r\n\r\n"I am so glad to hear you say so."\r\n\r\n"Is he a favourite of yours, Miss Effingham?"\r\n\r\n"Not now,--not particularly. I hardly ever see him. But his sister is\r\nthe best friend I have, and I used to like him so much when he was a\r\nboy! I have not seen that cottage since that day, and I remember it\r\nas though it were yesterday. Lord Chiltern is quite changed, is he\r\nnot?"\r\n\r\n"Changed,--in what way?"\r\n\r\n"They used to say that he was--unsteady you know."\r\n\r\n"I think he is changed. But Chiltern is at heart a Bohemian. It is\r\nimpossible not to see that at once. He hates the decencies of life."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he does," said Violet. "He ought to marry. If he were\r\nmarried, that would all be cured;--don\'t you think so?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot fancy him with a wife," said Phineas, "There is a savagery\r\nabout him which would make him an uncomfortable companion for a\r\nwoman."\r\n\r\n"But he would love his wife?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, as he does his horses. And he would treat her well,--as he does\r\nhis horses. But he expects every horse he has to do anything that any\r\nhorse can do; and he would expect the same of his wife."\r\n\r\nPhineas had no idea how deep an injury he might be doing his friend\r\nby this description, nor did it once occur to him that his companion\r\nwas thinking of herself as the possible wife of this Red Indian. Miss\r\nEffingham rode on in silence for some distance, and then she said\r\nbut one word more about Lord Chiltern. "He was so good to me in that\r\ncottage."\r\n\r\nOn the following day the party at Saulsby was broken up, and there\r\nwas a regular pilgrimage towards Loughlinter. Phineas resolved upon\r\nsleeping a night at Edinburgh on his way, and he found himself joined\r\nin the bands of close companionship with Mr. Ratler for the occasion.\r\nThe evening was by no means thrown away, for he learned much of his\r\ntrade from Mr. Ratler. And Mr. Ratler was heard to declare afterwards\r\nat Loughlinter that Mr. Finn was a pleasant young man.\r\n\r\nIt soon came to be admitted by all who knew Phineas Finn that he had\r\na peculiar power of making himself agreeable which no one knew how to\r\nanalyse or define. "I think it is because he listens so well," said\r\none man. "But the women would not like him for that," said another.\r\n"He has studied when to listen and when to talk," said a third. The\r\ntruth, however, was, that Phineas Finn had made no study in the\r\nmatter at all. It was simply his nature to be pleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nLoughlinter\r\n\r\n\r\nPhineas Finn reached Loughlinter together with Mr. Ratler in a\r\npost-chaise from the neighbouring town. Mr. Ratler, who had done this\r\nkind of thing very often before, travelled without impediments, but\r\nthe new servant of our hero\'s was stuck outside with the driver, and\r\nwas in the way. "I never bring a man with me," said Mr. Ratler to his\r\nyoung friend. "The servants of the house like it much better, because\r\nthey get fee\'d; you are just as well waited on, and it don\'t cost\r\nhalf as much." Phineas blushed as he heard all this; but there was\r\nthe impediment, not to be got rid of for the nonce, and Phineas made\r\nthe best of his attendant. "It\'s one of those points," said he, "as\r\nto which a man never quite makes up his mind. If you bring a fellow,\r\nyou wish you hadn\'t brought him; and if you don\'t, you wish you had."\r\n"I\'m a great deal more decided in my ways that that," said Mr.\r\nRatler.\r\n\r\nLoughlinter, as they approached it, seemed to Phineas to be a much\r\nfiner place than Saulsby. And so it was, except that Loughlinter\r\nwanted that graceful beauty of age which Saulsby possessed.\r\nLoughlinter was all of cut stone, but the stones had been cut only\r\nyesterday. It stood on a gentle slope, with a greensward falling from\r\nthe front entrance down to a mountain lake. And on the other side of\r\nthe Lough there rose a mighty mountain to the skies, Ben Linter. At\r\nthe foot of it, and all round to the left, there ran the woods of\r\nLinter, stretching for miles through crags and bogs and mountain\r\nlands. No better ground for deer than the side of Ben Linter was\r\nthere in all those highlands. And the Linter, rushing down into the\r\nLough through rocks which, in some places, almost met together above\r\nits waters, ran so near to the house that the pleasant noise of its\r\ncataracts could be heard from the hall door. Behind the house the\r\nexpanse of drained park land seemed to be interminable; and then,\r\nagain, came the mountains. There were Ben Linn and Ben Lody;--and\r\nthe whole territory belonging to Mr. Kennedy. He was laird of Linn\r\nand laird of Linter, as his people used to say. And yet his father\r\nhad walked into Glasgow as a little boy,--no doubt with the normal\r\nhalf-crown in his breeches pocket.\r\n\r\n"Magnificent;--is it not?" said Phineas to the Treasury Secretary,\r\nas they were being driven up to the door.\r\n\r\n"Very grand;--but the young trees show the new man. A new man may buy\r\na forest; but he can\'t get park trees."\r\n\r\nPhineas, at the moment, was thinking how far all these things which\r\nhe saw, the mountains stretching everywhere around him, the castle,\r\nthe lake, the river, the wealth of it all, and, more than the wealth,\r\nthe nobility of the beauty, might act as temptations to Lady Laura\r\nStandish. If a woman were asked to have the half of all this, would\r\nit be possible that she should prefer to take the half of his\r\nnothing? He thought it might be possible for a girl who would\r\nconfess, or seem to confess, that love should be everything. But it\r\ncould hardly be possible for a woman who looked at the world almost\r\nas a man looked at it,--as an oyster to be opened with such weapon\r\nas she could find ready to her hand. Lady Laura professed to have a\r\ncare for all the affairs of the world. She loved politics, and could\r\ntalk of social science, and had broad ideas about religion, and was\r\ndevoted to certain educational views. Such a woman would feel that\r\nwealth was necessary to her, and would be willing, for the sake of\r\nwealth, to put up with a husband without romance. Nay; might it not\r\nbe that she would prefer a husband without romance? Thus Phineas was\r\narguing to himself as he was driven up to the door of Loughlinter\r\nCastle, while Mr. Ratler was eloquent on the beauty of old park\r\ntrees. "After all, a Scotch forest is a very scrubby sort of thing,"\r\nsaid Mr. Ratler.\r\n\r\nThere was nobody in the house,--at least, they found nobody; and\r\nwithin half an hour Phineas was walking about the grounds by himself.\r\nMr. Ratler had declared himself to be delighted at having an\r\nopportunity of writing letters,--and no doubt was writing them by\r\nthe dozen, all dated from Loughlinter, and all detailing the facts\r\nthat Mr. Gresham, and Mr. Monk, and Plantagenet Palliser, and Lord\r\nBrentford were in the same house with him. Phineas had no letters to\r\nwrite, and therefore rushed down across the broad lawn to the river,\r\nof which he heard the noisy tumbling waters. There was something in\r\nthe air which immediately filled him with high spirits; and, in his\r\ndesire to investigate the glories of the place, he forgot that he was\r\ngoing to dine with four Cabinet Ministers in a row. He soon reached\r\nthe stream, and began to make his way up it through the ravine. There\r\nwas waterfall over waterfall, and there were little bridges here and\r\nthere which looked to be half natural and half artificial, and a path\r\nwhich required that you should climb, but which was yet a path, and\r\nall was so arranged that not a pleasant splashing rush of the waters\r\nwas lost to the visitor. He went on and on, up the stream, till there\r\nwas a sharp turn in the ravine, and then, looking upwards, he saw\r\nabove his head a man and a woman standing together on one of the\r\nlittle half-made wooden bridges. His eyes were sharp, and he saw at a\r\nglance that the woman was Lady Laura Standish. He had not recognised\r\nthe man, but he had very little doubt that it was Mr. Kennedy. Of\r\ncourse it was Mr. Kennedy, because he would prefer that it should be\r\nany other man under the sun. He would have turned back at once if he\r\nhad thought that he could have done so without being observed; but he\r\nfelt sure that, standing as they were, they must have observed him.\r\nHe did not like to join them. He would not intrude himself. So he\r\nremained still, and began to throw stones into the river. But he had\r\nnot thrown above a stone or two when he was called from above. He\r\nlooked up, and then he perceived that the man who called him was his\r\nhost. Of course it was Mr. Kennedy. Thereupon he ceased to throw\r\nstones, and went up the path, and joined them upon the bridge. Mr.\r\nKennedy stepped forward, and bade him welcome to Loughlinter. His\r\nmanner was less cold, and he seemed to have more words at command\r\nthan was usual with him. "You have not been long," he said, "in\r\nfinding out the most beautiful spot about the place."\r\n\r\n"Is it not lovely?" said Laura. "We have not been here an hour yet,\r\nand Mr. Kennedy insisted on bringing me here."\r\n\r\n"It is wonderfully beautiful," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"It is this very spot where we now stand that made me build the house\r\nwhere it is," said Mr. Kennedy, "and I was only eighteen when I stood\r\nhere and made up my mind. That is just twenty-five years ago." "So he\r\nis forty-three," said Phineas to himself, thinking how glorious it\r\nwas to be only twenty-five. "And within twelve months," continued Mr.\r\nKennedy, "the foundations were being dug and the stone-cutters were\r\nat work."\r\n\r\n"What a good-natured man your father must have been," said Lady\r\nLaura.\r\n\r\n"He had nothing else to do with his money but to pour it over my\r\nhead, as it were. I don\'t think he had any other enjoyment of it\r\nhimself. Will you go a little higher, Lady Laura? We shall get a fine\r\nview over to Ben Linn just now." Lady Laura declared that she would\r\ngo as much higher as he chose to take her, and Phineas was rather in\r\ndoubt as to what it would become him to do. He would stay where he\r\nwas, or go down, or make himself to vanish after any most acceptable\r\nfashion; but if he were to do so abruptly it would seem as though he\r\nwere attributing something special to the companionship of the other\r\ntwo. Mr. Kennedy saw his doubt, and asked him to join them. "You may\r\nas well come on, Mr. Finn. We don\'t dine till eight, and it is not\r\nmuch past six yet. The men of business are all writing letters, and\r\nthe ladies who have been travelling are in bed, I believe."\r\n\r\n"Not all of them, Mr. Kennedy," said Lady Laura. Then they went\r\non with their walk very pleasantly, and the lord of all that they\r\nsurveyed took them from one point of vantage to another, till they\r\nboth swore that of all spots upon the earth Loughlinter was surely\r\nthe most lovely. "I do delight in it, I own," said the lord. "When\r\nI come up here alone, and feel that in the midst of this little bit\r\nof a crowded island I have all this to myself,--all this with which\r\nno other man\'s wealth can interfere,--I grow proud of my own, till\r\nI become thoroughly ashamed of myself. After all, I believe it is\r\nbetter to dwell in cities than in the country,--better, at any rate,\r\nfor a rich man." Mr. Kennedy had now spoken more words than Phineas\r\nhad heard to fall from his lips during the whole time that they had\r\nbeen acquainted with each other.\r\n\r\n"I believe so too," said Laura, "if one were obliged to choose\r\nbetween the two. For myself, I think that a little of both is good\r\nfor man and woman."\r\n\r\n"There is no doubt about that," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"No doubt as far as enjoyment goes," said Mr. Kennedy.\r\n\r\nHe took them up out of the ravine on to the side of the mountain, and\r\nthen down by another path through the woods to the back of the house.\r\nAs they went he relapsed into his usual silence, and the conversation\r\nwas kept up between the other two. At a point not very far from the\r\ncastle,--just so far that one could see by the break of the ground\r\nwhere the castle stood, Kennedy left them. "Mr. Finn will take you\r\nback in safety, I am sure," said he, "and, as I am here, I\'ll go up\r\nto the farm for a moment. If I don\'t show myself now and again when I\r\nam here, they think I\'m indifferent about the \'bestials\'."\r\n\r\n"Now, Mr. Kennedy," said Lady Laura, "you are going to pretend to\r\nunderstand all about sheep and oxen." Mr. Kennedy, owning that it\r\nwas so, went away to his farm, and Phineas with Lady Laura returned\r\ntowards the house. "I think, upon the whole," said Lady Laura, "that\r\nthat is as good a man as I know."\r\n\r\n"I should think he is an idle one," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"I doubt that. He is, perhaps, neither zealous nor active. But he is\r\nthoughtful and high-principled, and has a method and a purpose in the\r\nuse which he makes of his money. And you see that he has poetry in\r\nhis nature too, if you get him upon the right string. How fond he is\r\nof the scenery of this place!"\r\n\r\n"Any man would be fond of that. I\'m ashamed to say that it almost\r\nmakes me envy him. I certainly never have wished to be Mr. Robert\r\nKennedy in London, but I should like to be the Laird of Loughlinter."\r\n\r\n"\'Laird of Linn and Laird of Linter,--Here in summer, gone in\r\nwinter.\' There is some ballad about the old lairds; but that belongs\r\nto a time when Mr. Kennedy had not been heard of, when some branch of\r\nthe Mackenzies lived down at that wretched old tower which you see as\r\nyou first come upon the lake. When old Mr. Kennedy bought it there\r\nwere hardly a hundred acres on the property under cultivation."\r\n\r\n"And it belonged to the Mackenzies."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--to the Mackenzie of Linn, as he was called. It was Mr.\r\nKennedy, the old man, who was first called Loughlinter. That is\r\nLinn Castle, and they lived there for hundreds of years. But these\r\nHighlanders, with all that is said of their family pride, have\r\nforgotten the Mackenzies already, and are quite proud of their rich\r\nlandlord."\r\n\r\n"That is unpoetical," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--but then poetry is so usually false. I doubt whether Scotland\r\nwould not have been as prosaic a country as any under the sun but for\r\nWalter Scott;--and I have no doubt that Henry V owes the romance of\r\nhis character altogether to Shakspeare."\r\n\r\n"I sometimes think you despise poetry," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"When it is false I do. The difficulty is to know when it is false\r\nand when it is true. Tom Moore was always false."\r\n\r\n"Not so false as Byron," said Phineas with energy.\r\n\r\n"Much more so, my friend. But we will not discuss that now. Have you\r\nseen Mr. Monk since you have been here?"\r\n\r\n"I have seen no one. I came with Mr. Ratler."\r\n\r\n"Why with Mr. Ratler? You cannot find Mr. Ratler a companion much to\r\nyour taste."\r\n\r\n"Chance brought us together. But Mr. Ratler is a man of sense, Lady\r\nLaura, and is not to be despised."\r\n\r\n"It always seems to me," said Lady Laura, "that nothing is to be\r\ngained in politics by sitting at the feet of the little Gamaliels."\r\n\r\n"But the great Gamaliels will not have a novice on their footstools."\r\n\r\n"Then sit at no man\'s feet. Is it not astonishing that the price\r\ngenerally put upon any article by the world is that which the owner\r\nputs on it?--and that this is specially true of a man\'s own self? If\r\nyou herd with Ratler, men will take it for granted that you are a\r\nRatlerite, and no more. If you consort with Greshams and Pallisers,\r\nyou will equally be supposed to know your own place."\r\n\r\n"I never knew a Mentor," said Phineas, "so apt as you are to fill his\r\nTelemachus with pride."\r\n\r\n"It is because I do not think your fault lies that way. If it did,\r\nor if I thought so, my Telemachus, you may be sure that I should\r\nresign my position as Mentor. Here are Mr. Kennedy and Lady Glencora\r\nand Mrs. Gresham on the steps." Then they went up through the Ionic\r\ncolumns on to the broad stone terrace before the door, and there they\r\nfound a crowd of men and women. For the legislators and statesmen had\r\nwritten their letters, and the ladies had taken their necessary rest.\r\n\r\nPhineas, as he was dressing, considered deeply all that Lady Laura\r\nhad said to him,--not so much with reference to the advice which she\r\nhad given him, though that also was of importance, as to the fact\r\nthat it had been given by her. She had first called herself his\r\nMentor; but he had accepted the name and had addressed her as her\r\nTelemachus. And yet he believed himself to be older than she,--if,\r\nindeed, there was any difference in their ages. And was it possible\r\nthat a female Mentor should love her Telemachus,--should love him as\r\nPhineas desired to be loved by Lady Laura? He would not say that it\r\nwas impossible. Perhaps there had been mistakes between them;--a\r\nmistake in his manner of addressing her, and another in hers of\r\naddressing him. Perhaps the old bachelor of forty-three was not\r\nthinking of a wife. Had this old bachelor of forty-three been really\r\nin love with Lady Laura, would he have allowed her to walk home alone\r\nwith Phineas, leaving her with some flimsy pretext of having to look\r\nat his sheep? Phineas resolved that he must at any rate play out his\r\ngame,--whether he were to lose it or to win it; and in playing it he\r\nmust, if possible, drop something of that Mentor and Telemachus style\r\nof conversation. As to the advice given him of herding with Greshams\r\nand Pallisers, instead of with Ratlers and Fitzgibbons,--he must use\r\nthat as circumstances might direct. To him, himself, as he thought\r\nof it all, it was sufficiently astonishing that even the Ratlers and\r\nFitzgibbons should admit him among them as one of themselves. "When\r\nI think of my father and of the old house at Killaloe, and remember\r\nthat hitherto I have done nothing myself, I cannot understand how\r\nit is that I should be at Loughlinter." There was only one way of\r\nunderstanding it. If Lady Laura really loved him, the riddle might\r\nbe read.\r\n\r\nThe rooms at Loughlinter were splendid, much larger and very much\r\nmore richly furnished than those at Saulsby. But there was a certain\r\nstiffness in the movement of things, and perhaps in the manner of\r\nsome of those present, which was not felt at Saulsby. Phineas at\r\nonce missed the grace and prettiness and cheery audacity of Violet\r\nEffingham, and felt at the same time that Violet Effingham would be\r\nout of her element at Loughlinter. At Loughlinter they were met for\r\nbusiness. It was at least a semi-political, or perhaps rather a\r\nsemi-official gathering, and he became aware that he ought not to\r\nlook simply for amusement. When he entered the drawing-room before\r\ndinner, Mr. Monk and Mr. Palliser, and Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Gresham,\r\nwith sundry others, were standing in a wide group before the\r\nfireplace, and among them were Lady Glencora Palliser and Lady Laura\r\nand Mrs. Bonteen. As he approached them it seemed as though a sort\r\nof opening was made for himself; but he could see, though others did\r\nnot, that the movement came from Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"I believe, Mr. Monk," said Lady Glencora, "that you and I are the\r\nonly two in the whole party who really know what we would be at."\r\n\r\n"If I must be divided from so many of my friends," said Mr. Monk, "I\r\nam happy to go astray in the company of Lady Glencora Palliser."\r\n\r\n"And might I ask," said Mr. Gresham, with a peculiar smile for which\r\nhe was famous, "what it is that you and Mr. Monk are really at?"\r\n\r\n"Making men and women all equal," said Lady Glencora. "That I take to\r\nbe the gist of our political theory."\r\n\r\n"Lady Glencora, I must cry off," said Mr. Monk.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--no doubt. If I were in the Cabinet myself I should not admit\r\nso much. There are reticences,--of course. And there is an official\r\ndiscretion."\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t mean to say, Lady Glencora, that you would really\r\nadvocate equality?" said Mrs. Bonteen.\r\n\r\n"I do mean to say so, Mrs. Bonteen. And I mean to go further, and to\r\ntell you that you are no Liberal at heart unless you do so likewise;\r\nunless that is the basis of your political aspirations."\r\n\r\n"Pray let me speak for myself, Lady Glencora."\r\n\r\n"By no means,--not when you are criticising me and my politics. Do\r\nyou not wish to make the lower orders comfortable?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said Mrs. Bonteen.\r\n\r\n"And educated, and happy and good?"\r\n\r\n"Undoubtedly."\r\n\r\n"To make them as comfortable and as good as yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Better if possible."\r\n\r\n"And I\'m sure you wish to make yourself as good and as comfortable as\r\nanybody else,--as those above you, if anybody is above you? You will\r\nadmit that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--if I understand you."\r\n\r\n"Then you have admitted everything, and are an advocate for general\r\nequality,--just as Mr. Monk is, and as I am. There is no getting out\r\nof it;--is there, Mr. Kennedy?" Then dinner was announced, and Mr.\r\nKennedy walked off with the French Republican on his arm. As she\r\nwent, she whispered into Mr. Kennedy\'s ear, "You will understand\r\nme. I am not saying that people are equal; but that the tendency\r\nof all law-making and of all governing should be to reduce the\r\ninequalities." In answer to which Mr. Kennedy said not a word. Lady\r\nGlencora\'s politics were too fast and furious for his nature.\r\n\r\nA week passed by at Loughlinter, at the end of which Phineas found\r\nhimself on terms of friendly intercourse with all the political\r\nmagnates assembled in the house, but especially with Mr. Monk. He had\r\ndetermined that he would not follow Lady Laura\'s advice as to his\r\nselection of companions, if in doing so he should be driven even to\r\na seeming of intrusion. He made no attempt to sit at the feet of\r\nanybody, and would stand aloof when bigger men than himself were\r\ntalking, and was content to be less,--as indeed he was less,--than\r\nMr. Bonteen or Mr. Ratler. But at the end of a week he found that,\r\nwithout any effort on his part,--almost in opposition to efforts on\r\nhis part,--he had fallen into an easy pleasant way with these men\r\nwhich was very delightful to him. He had killed a stag in company\r\nwith Mr. Palliser, and had stopped beneath a crag to discuss with him\r\na question as to the duty on Irish malt. He had played chess with Mr.\r\nGresham, and had been told that gentleman\'s opinion on the trial of\r\nMr. Jefferson Davis. Lord Brentford had--at last--called him Finn,\r\nand had proved to him that nothing was known in Ireland about sheep.\r\nBut with Mr. Monk he had had long discussions on abstract questions\r\nin politics,--and before the week was over was almost disposed to\r\ncall himself a disciple, or, at least, a follower of Mr. Monk. Why\r\nnot of Mr. Monk as well as of any one else? Mr. Monk was in the\r\nCabinet, and of all the members of the Cabinet was the most advanced\r\nLiberal. "Lady Glencora was not so far wrong the other night," Mr.\r\nMonk said to him. "Equality is an ugly word and shouldn\'t be used. It\r\nmisleads, and frightens, and is a bugbear. And she, in using it, had\r\nnot perhaps a clearly defined meaning for it in her own mind. But\r\nthe wish of every honest man should be to assist in lifting up those\r\nbelow him, till they be something nearer his own level than he finds\r\nthem." To this Phineas assented,--and by degrees he found himself\r\nassenting to a great many things that Mr. Monk said to him.\r\n\r\nMr. Monk was a thin, tall, gaunt man, who had devoted his whole life\r\nto politics, hitherto without any personal reward beyond that which\r\ncame to him from the reputation of his name, and from the honour of\r\na seat in Parliament. He was one of four or five brothers,--and all\r\nbesides him were in trade. They had prospered in trade, whereas he\r\nhad prospered solely in politics; and men said that he was dependent\r\naltogether on what his relatives supplied for his support. He had now\r\nbeen in Parliament for more than twenty years, and had been known not\r\nonly as a Radical but as a Democrat. Ten years since, when he had\r\nrisen to fame, but not to repute, among the men who then governed\r\nEngland, nobody dreamed that Joshua Monk would ever be a paid servant\r\nof the Crown. He had inveighed against one minister after another\r\nas though they all deserved impeachment. He had advocated political\r\ndoctrines which at that time seemed to be altogether at variance\r\nwith any possibility of governing according to English rules of\r\ngovernment. He had been regarded as a pestilent thorn in the sides of\r\nall ministers. But now he was a member of the Cabinet, and those whom\r\nhe had terrified in the old days began to find that he was not so\r\nmuch unlike other men. There are but few horses which you cannot put\r\ninto harness, and those of the highest spirit will generally do your\r\nwork the best.\r\n\r\nPhineas, who had his eyes about him, thought that he could perceive\r\nthat Mr. Palliser did not shoot a deer with Mr. Ratler, and that Mr.\r\nGresham played no chess with Mr. Bonteen. Bonteen, indeed, was a\r\nnoisy pushing man whom nobody seemed to like, and Phineas wondered\r\nwhy he should be at Loughlinter, and why he should be in office. His\r\nfriend Laurence Fitzgibbon had indeed once endeavoured to explain\r\nthis. "A man who can vote hard, as I call it; and who will speak a\r\nfew words now and then as they\'re wanted, without any ambition that\r\nway, may always have his price. And if he has a pretty wife into the\r\nbargain, he ought to have a pleasant time of it." Mr. Ratler no doubt\r\nwas a very useful man, who thoroughly knew his business; but yet,\r\nas it seemed to Phineas, no very great distinction was shown to\r\nMr. Ratler at Loughlinter. "If I got as high as that," he said to\r\nhimself, "I should think myself a miracle of luck. And yet nobody\r\nseems to think anything of Ratler. It is all nothing unless one can\r\ngo to the very top."\r\n\r\n"I believe I did right to accept office," Mr. Monk said to him one\r\nday, as they sat together on a rock close by one of the little\r\nbridges over the Linter. "Indeed, unless a man does so when the bonds\r\nof the office tendered to him are made compatible with his own views,\r\nhe declines to proceed on the open path towards the prosecution of\r\nthose views. A man who is combating one ministry after another, and\r\nstriving to imbue those ministers with his convictions, can hardly\r\ndecline to become a minister himself when he finds that those\r\nconvictions of his own are henceforth,--or at least for some time to\r\ncome,--to be the ministerial convictions of the day. Do you follow\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"Very clearly," said Phineas. "You would have denied your own\r\nchildren had you refused."\r\n\r\n"Unless indeed a man were to feel that he was in some way unfitted\r\nfor office work. I very nearly provided for myself an escape on that\r\nplea;--but when I came to sift it, I thought that it would be false.\r\nBut let me tell you that the delight of political life is altogether\r\nin opposition. Why, it is freedom against slavery, fire against clay,\r\nmovement against stagnation! The very inaccuracy which is permitted\r\nto opposition is in itself a charm worth more than all the patronage\r\nand all the prestige of ministerial power. You\'ll try them both, and\r\nthen say if you do not agree with me. Give me the full swing of the\r\nbenches below the gangway, where I needed to care for no one, and\r\ncould always enjoy myself on my legs as long as I felt that I was\r\ntrue to those who sent me there! That is all over now. They have got\r\nme into harness, and my shoulders are sore. The oats, however, are of\r\nthe best, and the hay is unexceptionable."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nDonald Bean\'s Pony\r\n\r\n\r\nPhineas liked being told that the pleasures of opposition and the\r\npleasures of office were both open to him,--and he liked also to\r\nbe the chosen receptacle of Mr. Monk\'s confidence. He had come to\r\nunderstand that he was expected to remain ten days at Loughlinter,\r\nand that then there was to be a general movement. Since the first day\r\nhe had seen but little of Mr. Kennedy, but he had found himself very\r\nfrequently with Lady Laura. And then had come up the question of his\r\nprojected trip to Paris with Lord Chiltern. He had received a letter\r\nfrom Lord Chiltern.\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR FINN,\r\n\r\n   Are you going to Paris with me?\r\n\r\n   Yours, C.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere had been not a word beyond this, and before he answered it he\r\nmade up his mind to tell Lady Laura the truth. He could not go to\r\nParis because he had no money.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve just got that from your brother," said he.\r\n\r\n"How like Oswald. He writes to me perhaps three times in the year,\r\nand his letters are just the same. You will go I hope?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--no."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry for that."\r\n\r\n"I wonder whether I may tell you the real reason, Lady Laura."\r\n\r\n"Nay;--I cannot answer that; but unless it be some political secret\r\nbetween you and Mr. Monk, I should think you might."\r\n\r\n"I cannot afford to go to Paris this autumn. It seems to be a\r\nshocking admission to make,--though I don\'t know why it should be."\r\n\r\n"Nor I;--but, Mr. Finn, I like you all the better for making it. I\r\nam very sorry, for Oswald\'s sake. It\'s so hard to find any companion\r\nfor him whom he would like and whom we,--that is I,--should think\r\naltogether--; you know what I mean, Mr. Finn."\r\n\r\n"Your wish that I should go with him is a great compliment, and I\r\nthoroughly wish that I could do it. As it is, I must go to Killaloe\r\nand retrieve my finances. I daresay, Lady Laura, you can hardly\r\nconceive how very poor a man I am." There was a melancholy tone\r\nabout his voice as he said this, which made her think for the moment\r\nwhether or no he had been right in going into Parliament, and whether\r\nshe had been right in instigating him to do so. But it was too late\r\nto recur to that question now.\r\n\r\n"You must climb into office early, and forego those pleasures of\r\nopposition which are so dear to Mr. Monk," she said, smiling. "After\r\nall, money is an accident which does not count nearly so high as do\r\nsome other things. You and Mr. Kennedy have the same enjoyment of\r\neverything around you here."\r\n\r\n"Yes; while it lasts."\r\n\r\n"And Lady Glencora and I stand pretty much on the same footing, in\r\nspite of all her wealth,--except that she is a married woman. I do\r\nnot know what she is worth,--something not to be counted; and I am\r\nworth,--just what papa chooses to give me. A ten-pound note at the\r\npresent moment I should look upon as great riches." This was the\r\nfirst time she had ever spoken to him of her own position as regards\r\nmoney; but he had heard, or thought that he had heard, that she had\r\nbeen left a fortune altogether independent of her father.\r\n\r\nThe last of the ten days had now come, and Phineas was discontented\r\nand almost unhappy. The more he saw of Lady Laura the more he feared\r\nthat it was impossible that she should become his wife. And yet from\r\nday to day his intimacy with her became more close. He had never made\r\nlove to her, nor could he discover that it was possible for him to\r\ndo so. She seemed to be a woman for whom all the ordinary stages of\r\nlove-making were quite unsuitable, Of course he could declare his\r\nlove and ask her to be his wife on any occasion on which he might\r\nfind himself to be alone with her. And on this morning he had made\r\nup his mind that he would do so before the day was over. It might\r\nbe possible that she would never speak to him again;--that all the\r\npleasures and ambitious hopes to which she had introduced him might\r\nbe over as soon as that rash word should have been spoken! But,\r\nnevertheless, he would speak it.\r\n\r\nOn this day there was to be a grouse-shooting party, and the shooters\r\nwere to be out early. It had been talked of for some day or two past,\r\nand Phineas knew that he could not escape it. There had been some\r\nrivalry between him and Mr. Bonteen, and there was to be a sort of\r\nmatch as to which of the two would kill most birds before lunch. But\r\nthere had also been some half promise on Lady Laura\'s part that she\r\nwould walk with him up the Linter and come down upon the lake, taking\r\nan opposite direction from that by which they had returned with Mr.\r\nKennedy.\r\n\r\n"But you will be shooting all day," she said, when he proposed it to\r\nher as they were starting for the moor. The waggonet that was to take\r\nthem was at the door, and she was there to see them start. Her father\r\nwas one of the shooting party, and Mr. Kennedy was another.\r\n\r\n"I will undertake to be back in time, if you will not think it too\r\nhot. I shall not see you again till we meet in town next year."\r\n\r\n"Then I certainly will go with you,--that is to say, if you are here.\r\nBut you cannot return without the rest of the party, as you are going\r\nso far."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll get back somehow," said Phineas, who was resolved that a\r\nfew miles more or less of mountain should not detain him from the\r\nprosecution of a task so vitally important to him. "If we start at\r\nfive that will be early enough."\r\n\r\n"Quite early enough," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\nPhineas went off to the mountains, and shot his grouse, and won his\r\nmatch, and eat his luncheon. Mr. Bonteen, however, was not beaten by\r\nmuch, and was in consequence somewhat ill-humoured.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what I\'ll do," said Mr. Bonteen, "I\'ll back myself for\r\nthe rest of the day for a ten-pound note."\r\n\r\nNow there had been no money staked on the match at all,--but it had\r\nbeen simply a trial of skill, as to which would kill the most birds\r\nin a given time. And the proposition for that trial had come from Mr.\r\nBonteen himself. "I should not think of shooting for money," said\r\nPhineas.\r\n\r\n"And why not? A bet is the only way to decide these things."\r\n\r\n"Partly because I\'m sure I shouldn\'t hit a bird," said Phineas, "and\r\npartly because I haven\'t got any money to lose."\r\n\r\n"I hate bets," said Mr. Kennedy to him afterwards. "I was annoyed\r\nwhen Bonteen offered the wager. I felt sure, however, you would not\r\naccept it."\r\n\r\n"I suppose such bets are very common."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think men ought to propose them unless they are quite\r\nsure of their company. Maybe I\'m wrong, and I often feel that I am\r\nstrait-laced about such things. It is so odd to me that men cannot\r\namuse themselves without pitting themselves against each other. When\r\na man tells me that he can shoot better than I, I tell him that my\r\nkeeper can shoot better than he."\r\n\r\n"All the same, it\'s a good thing to excel," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not so sure of that," said Mr. Kennedy. "A man who can kill more\r\nsalmon than anybody else, can rarely do anything else. Are you going\r\non with your match?"\r\n\r\n"No; I\'m going to make my way to Loughlinter."\r\n\r\n"Not alone?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, alone."\r\n\r\n"It\'s over nine miles. You can\'t walk it."\r\n\r\nPhineas looked at his watch, and found that it was now two o\'clock.\r\nIt was a broiling day in August, and the way back to Loughlinter, for\r\nsix or seven out of the nine miles, would be along a high road. "I\r\nmust do it all the same," said he, preparing for a start. "I have an\r\nengagement with Lady Laura Standish; and as this is the last day that\r\nI shall see her, I certainly do not mean to break it."\r\n\r\n"An engagement with Lady Laura," said Mr. Kennedy. "Why did you not\r\ntell me, that I might have a pony ready? But come along. Donald Bean\r\nhas a pony. He\'s not much bigger than a dog, but he\'ll carry you to\r\nLoughlinter."\r\n\r\n"I can walk it, Mr. Kennedy."\r\n\r\n"Yes; and think of the state in which you\'d reach Loughlinter! Come\r\nalong with me."\r\n\r\n"But I can\'t take you off the mountain," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Then you must allow me to take you off."\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Kennedy led the way down to Donald Bean\'s cottage, and before\r\nthree o\'clock Phineas found himself mounted on a shaggy steed, which,\r\nin sober truth, was not much bigger than a large dog. "If Mr. Kennedy\r\nis really my rival," said Phineas to himself, as he trotted along, "I\r\nalmost think that I am doing an unhandsome thing in taking the pony."\r\n\r\nAt five o\'clock he was under the portico before the front door, and\r\nthere he found Lady Laura waiting for him,--waiting for him, or at\r\nleast ready for him. She had on her hat and gloves and light shawl,\r\nand her parasol was in her hand. He thought that he had never seen\r\nher look so young, so pretty, and so fit to receive a lover\'s vows.\r\nBut at the same moment it occurred to him that she was Lady Laura\r\nStandish, the daughter of an Earl, the descendant of a line of\r\nEarls,--and that he was the son of a simple country doctor in\r\nIreland. Was it fitting that he should ask such a woman to be his\r\nwife? But then Mr. Kennedy was the son of a man who had walked into\r\nGlasgow with half-a-crown in his pocket. Mr. Kennedy\'s grandfather\r\nhad been,--Phineas thought that he had heard that Mr. Kennedy\'s\r\ngrandfather had been a Scotch drover; whereas his own grandfather\r\nhad been a little squire near Ennistimon, in county Clare, and his\r\nown first cousin once removed still held the paternal acres at Finn\r\nGrove. His family was supposed to be descended from kings in that\r\npart of Ireland. It certainly did not become him to fear Lady Laura\r\non the score of rank, if it was to be allowed to Mr. Kennedy to\r\nproceed without fear on that head. As to wealth, Lady Laura had\r\nalready told him that her fortune was no greater than his. Her\r\nstatement to himself on that head made him feel that he should not\r\nhesitate on the score of money. They neither had any, and he was\r\nwilling to work for both. If she feared the risk, let her say so.\r\n\r\nIt was thus that he argued with himself; but yet he knew,--knew as\r\nwell as the reader will know,--that he was going to do that which he\r\nhad no right to do. It might be very well for him to wait,--presuming\r\nhim to be successful in his love,--for the opening of that oyster\r\nwith his political sword, that oyster on which he proposed that they\r\nshould both live; but such waiting could not well be to the taste\r\nof Lady Laura Standish. It could hardly be pleasant to her to look\r\nforward to his being made a junior lord or an assistant secretary\r\nbefore she could establish herself in her home. So he told himself.\r\nAnd yet he told himself at the same time that it was incumbent on him\r\nto persevere.\r\n\r\n"I did not expect you in the least," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"And yet I spoke very positively."\r\n\r\n"But there are things as to which a man may be very positive, and yet\r\nmay be allowed to fail. In the first place, how on earth did you get\r\nhome?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Kennedy got me a pony,--Donald Bean\'s pony."\r\n\r\n"You told him, then?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I told him why I was coming, and that I must be here. Then he\r\ntook the trouble to come all the way off the mountain to persuade\r\nDonald to lend me his pony. I must acknowledge that Mr. Kennedy has\r\nconquered me at last."\r\n\r\n"I am so glad of that," said Lady Laura. "I knew he would,--unless it\r\nwere your own fault."\r\n\r\nThey went up the path by the brook, from bridge to bridge, till they\r\nfound themselves out upon the open mountain at the top. Phineas had\r\nresolved that he would not speak out his mind till he found himself\r\non that spot; that then he would ask her to sit down, and that while\r\nshe was so seated he would tell her everything. At the present moment\r\nhe had on his head a Scotch cap with a grouse\'s feather in it, and he\r\nwas dressed in a velvet shooting-jacket and dark knickerbockers; and\r\nwas certainly, in this costume, as handsome a man as any woman would\r\nwish to see. And there was, too, a look of breeding about him which\r\nhad come to him, no doubt, from the royal Finns of old, which ever\r\nserved him in great stead. He was, indeed, only Phineas Finn, and\r\nwas known by the world to be no more; but he looked as though he\r\nmight have been anybody,--a royal Finn himself. And then he had\r\nthat special grace of appearing to be altogether unconscious of his\r\nown personal advantages. And I think that in truth he was barely\r\nconscious of them; that he depended on them very little, if at all;\r\nthat there was nothing of personal vanity in his composition. He had\r\nnever indulged in any hope that Lady Laura would accept him because\r\nhe was a handsome man.\r\n\r\n"After all that climbing," he said, "will you not sit down for a\r\nmoment?" As he spoke to her she looked at him and told herself that\r\nhe was as handsome as a god. "Do sit down for one moment," he said.\r\n"I have something that I desire to say to you, and to say it here."\r\n\r\n"I will," she said; "but I also have something to tell you, and will\r\nsay it while I am yet standing. Yesterday I accepted an offer of\r\nmarriage from Mr. Kennedy."\r\n\r\n"Then I am too late," said Phineas, and putting his hands into the\r\npockets of his coat, he turned his back upon her, and walked away\r\nacross the mountain.\r\n\r\nWhat a fool he had been to let her know his secret when her knowledge\r\nof it could be of no service to him,--when her knowledge of it could\r\nonly make him appear foolish in her eyes! But for his life he could\r\nnot have kept his secret to himself. Nor now could he bring himself\r\nto utter a word of even decent civility. But he went on walking as\r\nthough he could thus leave her there, and never see her again. What\r\nan ass he had been in supposing that she cared for him! What a fool\r\nto imagine that his poverty could stand a chance against the wealth\r\nof Loughlinter! But why had she lured him on? How he wished that he\r\nwere now grinding, hard at work in Mr. Low\'s chambers, or sitting\r\nat home at Killaloe with the hand of that pretty little Irish girl\r\nwithin his own!\r\n\r\nPresently he heard a voice behind him,--calling him gently. Then he\r\nturned and found that she was very near him. He himself had then\r\nbeen standing still for some moments, and she had followed him. "Mr.\r\nFinn," she said.\r\n\r\n"Well;--yes: what is it?" And turning round he made an attempt to\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"Will you not wish me joy, or say a word of congratulation? Had I not\r\nthought much of your friendship, I should not have been so quick to\r\ntell you of my destiny. No one else has been told, except papa."\r\n\r\n"Of course I hope you will be happy. Of course I do. No wonder he\r\nlent me the pony!"\r\n\r\n"You must forget all that."\r\n\r\n"Forget what?"\r\n\r\n"Well,--nothing. You need forget nothing," said Lady Laura, "for\r\nnothing has been said that need be regretted. Only wish me joy, and\r\nall will be pleasant."\r\n\r\n"Lady Laura, I do wish you joy, with all my heart,--but that will not\r\nmake all things pleasant. I came up here to ask you to be my wife."\r\n\r\n"No;--no, no; do not say it."\r\n\r\n"But I have said it, and will say it again. I, poor, penniless, plain\r\nsimple fool that I am, have been ass enough to love you, Lady Laura\r\nStandish; and I brought you up here to-day to ask you to share with\r\nme--my nothingness. And this I have done on soil that is to be all\r\nyour own. Tell me that you regard me as a conceited fool,--as a\r\nbewildered idiot."\r\n\r\n"I wish to regard you as a dear friend,--both of my own and of my\r\nhusband," said she, offering him her hand.\r\n\r\n"Should I have had a chance, I wonder, if I had spoken a week since?"\r\n\r\n"How can I answer such a question, Mr. Finn? Or, rather, I will,\r\nanswer it fully. It is not a week since we told each other, you to\r\nme and I to you, that we were both poor,--both without other means\r\nthan those which come to us from our fathers. You will make your\r\nway;--will make it surely; but how at present could you marry any\r\nwoman unless she had money of her own? For me,--like so many other\r\ngirls, it was necessary that I should stay at home or marry some one\r\nrich enough to dispense with fortune in a wife. The man whom in all\r\nthe world I think the best has asked me to share everything with\r\nhim;--and I have thought it wise to accept his offer."\r\n\r\n"And I was fool enough to think that you loved me," said Phineas. To\r\nthis she made no immediate answer. "Yes, I was. I feel that I owe it\r\nyou to tell you what a fool I have been. I did. I thought you loved\r\nme. At least I thought that perhaps you loved me. It was like a child\r\nwanting the moon;--was it not?"\r\n\r\n"And why should I not have loved you?" she said slowly, laying her\r\nhand gently upon his arm.\r\n\r\n"Why not? Because Loughlinter--"\r\n\r\n"Stop, Mr. Finn; stop. Do not say to me any unkind word that I\r\nhave not deserved, and that would make a breach between us. I have\r\naccepted the owner of Loughlinter as my husband, because I verily\r\nbelieve that I shall thus do my duty in that sphere of life to which\r\nit has pleased God to call me. I have always liked him, and I will\r\nlove him. For you,--may I trust myself to speak openly to you?"\r\n\r\n"You may trust me as against all others, except us two ourselves."\r\n\r\n"For you, then, I will say also that I have always liked you since I\r\nknew you; that I have loved you as a friend;--and could have loved\r\nyou otherwise had not circumstances showed me so plainly that it\r\nwould be unwise."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lady Laura!"\r\n\r\n"Listen a moment. And pray remember that what I say to you now must\r\nnever be repeated to any ears. No one knows it but my father, my\r\nbrother, and Mr. Kennedy. Early in the spring I paid my brother\'s\r\ndebts. His affection to me is more than a return for what I have done\r\nfor him. But when I did this,--when I made up my mind to do it, I\r\nmade up my mind also that I could not allow myself the same freedom\r\nof choice which would otherwise have belonged to me. Will that be\r\nsufficient, Mr. Finn?"\r\n\r\n"How can I answer you, Lady Laura? Sufficient! And you are not angry\r\nwith me for what I have said?"\r\n\r\n"No, I am not angry. But it is understood, of course, that nothing\r\nof this shall ever be repeated,--even among ourselves. Is that a\r\nbargain?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. I shall never speak of it again."\r\n\r\n"And now you will wish me joy?"\r\n\r\n"I have wished you joy, Lady Laura. And I will do so again. May you\r\nhave every blessing which the world can give you. You cannot expect\r\nme to be very jovial for awhile myself; but there will be nobody to\r\nsee my melancholy moods. I shall be hiding myself away in Ireland.\r\nWhen is the marriage to be?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing has been said of that. I shall be guided by him,--but there\r\nmust, of course, be delay. There will be settlements and I know not\r\nwhat. It may probably be in the spring,--or perhaps the summer. I\r\nshall do just what my betters tell me to do."\r\n\r\nPhineas had now seated himself on the exact stone on which he had\r\nwished her to sit when he proposed to tell his own story, and was\r\nlooking forth upon the lake. It seemed to him that everything had\r\nbeen changed for him while he had been up there upon the mountain,\r\nand that the change had been marvellous in its nature. When he had\r\nbeen coming up, there had been apparently two alternatives before\r\nhim: the glory of successful love,--which, indeed, had seemed to him\r\nto be a most improbable result of the coming interview,--and the\r\ndespair and utter banishment attendant on disdainful rejection. But\r\nhis position was far removed from either of these alternatives. She\r\nhad almost told him that she would have loved him had she not been\r\npoor,--that she was beginning to love him and had quenched her love,\r\nbecause it had become impossible to her to marry a poor man. In such\r\ncircumstances he could not be angry with her,--he could not quarrel\r\nwith her; he could not do other than swear to himself that he would\r\nbe her friend. And yet he loved her better than ever;--and she was\r\nthe promised wife of his rival! Why had not Donald Bean\'s pony broken\r\nhis neck?\r\n\r\n"Shall we go down now?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes."\r\n\r\n"You will not go on by the lake?"\r\n\r\n"What is the use? It is all the same now. You will want to be back to\r\nreceive him in from shooting."\r\n\r\n"Not that, I think. He is above those little cares. But it will be as\r\nwell we should go the nearest way, as we have spent so much of our\r\ntime here. I shall tell Mr. Kennedy that I have told you,--if you do\r\nnot mind."\r\n\r\n"Tell him what you please," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"But I won\'t have it taken in that way, Mr. Finn. Your brusque want\r\nof courtesy to me I have forgiven, but I shall expect you to make up\r\nfor it by the alacrity of your congratulations to him. I will not\r\nhave you uncourteous to Mr. Kennedy."\r\n\r\n"If I have been uncourteous I beg your pardon."\r\n\r\n"You need not do that. We are old friends, and may take the liberty\r\nof speaking plainly to each other;--but you will owe it to Mr.\r\nKennedy to be gracious. Think of the pony."\r\n\r\nThey walked back to the house together, and as they went down the\r\npath very little was said. Just as they were about to come out upon\r\nthe open lawn, while they were still under cover of the rocks and\r\nshrubs, Phineas stopped his companion by standing before her, and\r\nthen he made his farewell speech to her.\r\n\r\n"I must say good-bye to you. I shall be away early in the morning."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, and God bless you," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"Give me your hand," said he. And she gave him her hand. "I don\'t\r\nsuppose you know what it is to love dearly."\r\n\r\n"I hope I do."\r\n\r\n"But to be in love! I believe you do not. And to miss your love! I\r\nthink,--I am bound to think that you have never been so tormented. It\r\nis very sore;--but I will do my best, like a man, to get over it."\r\n\r\n"Do, my friend, do. So small a trouble will never weigh heavily on\r\nshoulders such as yours."\r\n\r\n"It will weigh very heavily, but I will struggle hard that it may not\r\ncrush me. I have loved you so dearly! As we are parting give me one\r\nkiss, that I may think of it and treasure it in my memory!" What\r\nmurmuring words she spoke to express her refusal of such a request,\r\nI will not quote; but the kiss had been taken before the denial was\r\ncompleted, and then they walked on in silence together,--and in\r\npeace, towards the house.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning six or seven men were going away, and there was\r\nan early breakfast. There were none of the ladies there, but Mr.\r\nKennedy, the host, was among his friends. A large drag with four\r\nhorses was there to take the travellers and their luggage to the\r\nstation, and there was naturally a good deal of noise at the front\r\ndoor as the preparations for the departure were made. In the middle\r\nof them Mr. Kennedy took our hero aside. "Laura has told me," said\r\nMr. Kennedy, "that she has acquainted you with my good fortune."\r\n\r\n"And I congratulate you most heartily," said Phineas, grasping the\r\nother\'s hand. "You are indeed a lucky fellow."\r\n\r\n"I feel myself to be so," said Mr. Kennedy. "Such a wife was all that\r\nwas wanting to me, and such a wife is very hard to find. Will you\r\nremember, Finn, that Loughlinter will never be so full but what\r\nthere will be a room for you, or so empty but what you will be made\r\nwelcome? I say this on Lady Laura\'s part and on my own."\r\n\r\nPhineas, as he was being carried away to the railway station, could\r\nnot keep himself from speculating as to how much Kennedy knew of\r\nwhat had taken place during the walk up the Linter. Of one small\r\ncircumstance that had occurred, he felt quite sure that Mr. Kennedy\r\nknew nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nPhineas Finn Returns to Killaloe\r\n\r\n\r\nPhineas Finn\'s first session of Parliament was over,--his first\r\nsession with all its adventures. When he got back to Mrs. Bunce\'s\r\nhouse,--for Mrs. Bunce received him for a night in spite of her\r\nhusband\'s advice to the contrary,--I am afraid he almost felt that\r\nMrs. Bunce and her rooms were beneath him. Of course he was very\r\nunhappy,--as wretched as a man can be; there were moments in which he\r\nthought that it would hardly become him to live unless he could do\r\nsomething to prevent the marriage of Lady Laura and Mr. Kennedy. But,\r\nnevertheless, he had his consolations. These were reflections which\r\nhad in them much of melancholy satisfaction. He had not been despised\r\nby the woman to whom he had told his love. She had not shown him that\r\nshe thought him to be unworthy of her. She had not regarded his love\r\nas an offence. Indeed, she had almost told him that prudence alone\r\nhad forbidden her to return his passion. And he had kissed her, and\r\nhad afterwards parted from her as a dear friend. I do not know why\r\nthere should have been a flavour of exquisite joy in the midst of his\r\nagony as he thought of this;--but it was so. He would never kiss her\r\nagain. All future delights of that kind would belong to Mr. Kennedy,\r\nand he had no real idea of interfering with that gentleman in the\r\nfruition of his privileges. But still there was the kiss,--an\r\neternal fact. And then, in all respects except that of his love, his\r\nvisit to Loughlinter had been pre-eminently successful. Mr. Monk had\r\nbecome his friend, and had encouraged him to speak during the next\r\nsession,--setting before him various models, and prescribing for him\r\na course of reading. Lord Brentford had become intimate with him. He\r\nwas on pleasant terms with Mr. Palliser and Mr. Gresham. And as for\r\nMr. Kennedy,--he and Mr. Kennedy were almost bosom friends. It seemed\r\nto him that he had quite surpassed the Ratlers, Fitzgibbons, and\r\nBonteens in that politico-social success which goes so far towards\r\ndownright political success, and which in itself is so pleasant. He\r\nhad surpassed these men in spite of their offices and their acquired\r\npositions, and could not but think that even Mr. Low, if he knew it\r\nall, would confess that he had been right.\r\n\r\nAs to his bosom friendship with Mr. Kennedy, that of course troubled\r\nhim. Ought he not to be driving a poniard into Mr. Kennedy\'s heart?\r\nThe conventions of life forbade that; and therefore the bosom\r\nfriendship was to be excused. If not an enemy to the death, then\r\nthere could be no reason why he should not be a bosom friend.\r\n\r\nHe went over to Ireland, staying but one night with Mrs. Bunce, and\r\ncame down upon them at Killaloe like a god out of the heavens. Even\r\nhis father was well-nigh overwhelmed by admiration, and his mother\r\nand sisters thought themselves only fit to minister to his pleasures.\r\nHe had learned, if he had learned nothing else, to look as though he\r\nwere master of the circumstances around him, and was entirely free\r\nfrom internal embarrassment. When his father spoke to him about his\r\nlegal studies, he did not exactly laugh at his father\'s ignorance,\r\nbut he recapitulated to his father so much of Mr. Monk\'s wisdom at\r\nsecond hand,--showing plainly that it was his business to study the\r\narts of speech and the technicalities of the House, and not to study\r\nlaw,--that his father had nothing further to say. He had become a\r\nman of such dimensions that an ordinary father could hardly dare to\r\ninquire into his proceedings; and as for an ordinary mother,--such as\r\nMrs. Finn certainly was,--she could do no more than look after her\r\nson\'s linen with awe.\r\n\r\nMary Flood Jones,--the reader I hope will not quite have forgotten\r\nMary Flood Jones,--was in a great tremor when first she met the hero\r\nof Loughshane after returning from the honours of his first session.\r\nShe had been somewhat disappointed because the newspapers had not\r\nbeen full of the speeches he had made in Parliament. And indeed the\r\nladies of the Finn household had all been ill at ease on this head.\r\nThey could not imagine why Phineas had restrained himself with so\r\nmuch philosophy. But Miss Flood Jones in discussing the matter\r\nwith the Miss Finns had never expressed the slightest doubt of his\r\ncapacity or his judgment. And when tidings came,--the tidings came\r\nin a letter from Phineas to his father,--that he did not intend to\r\nspeak that session, because speeches from a young member on his first\r\nsession were thought to be inexpedient, Miss Flood Jones and the Miss\r\nFinns were quite willing to accept the wisdom of this decision, much\r\nas they might regret the effect of it. Mary, when she met her hero,\r\nhardly dared to look him in the face, but she remembered accurately\r\nall the circumstances of her last interview with him. Could it be\r\nthat he wore that ringlet near his heart? Mary had received from\r\nBarbara Finn certain hairs supposed to have come from the head of\r\nPhineas, and these she always wore near her own. And moreover, since\r\nshe had seen Phineas she had refused an offer of marriage from Mr.\r\nElias Bodkin,--had refused it almost ignominiously,--and when doing\r\nso had told herself that she would never be false to Phineas Finn.\r\n\r\n"We think it so good of you to come to see us again," she said.\r\n\r\n"Good to come home to my own people?"\r\n\r\n"Of course you might be staying with plenty of grandees if you liked\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, Mary. It did happen by accident that I had to go to the\r\nhouse of a man whom perhaps you would call a grandee, and to meet\r\ngrandees there. But it was only for a few days, and I am very glad to\r\nbe taken in again here, I can assure you."\r\n\r\n"You know how very glad we all are to have you."\r\n\r\n"Are you glad to see me, Mary?"\r\n\r\n"Very glad. Why should I not be glad, and Barbara the dearest friend\r\nI have in the world? Of course she talks about you,--and that makes\r\nme think of you."\r\n\r\n"If you knew, Mary, how often I think about you." Then Mary, who was\r\nvery happy at hearing such words, and who was walking in to dinner\r\nwith him at the moment, could not refrain herself from pressing his\r\narm with her little fingers. She knew that Phineas in his position\r\ncould not marry at once; but she would wait for him,--oh, for ever,\r\nif he would only ask her. He of course was a wicked traitor to tell\r\nher that he was wont to think of her. But Jove smiles at lovers\'\r\nperjuries;--and it is well that he should do so, as such perjuries\r\ncan hardly be avoided altogether in the difficult circumstances of a\r\nsuccessful gentleman\'s life. Phineas was a traitor, of course, but he\r\nwas almost forced to be a traitor, by the simple fact that Lady Laura\r\nStandish was in London, and Mary Flood Jones in Killaloe.\r\n\r\nHe remained for nearly five months at Killaloe, and I doubt whether\r\nhis time was altogether well spent. Some of the books recommended\r\nto him by Mr. Monk he probably did read, and was often to be found\r\nencompassed by blue books. I fear that there was a grain of pretence\r\nabout his blue books and parliamentary papers, and that in these days\r\nhe was, in a gentle way, something of an impostor. "You must not be\r\nangry with me for not going to you," he said once to Mary\'s mother\r\nwhen he had declined an invitation to drink tea; "but the fact is\r\nthat my time is not my own." "Pray don\'t make any apologies. We are\r\nquite aware that we have very little to offer," said Mrs. Flood\r\nJones, who was not altogether happy about Mary, and who perhaps knew\r\nmore about members of Parliament and blue books than Phineas Finn had\r\nsupposed. "Mary, you are a fool to think of that man," the mother\r\nsaid to her daughter the next morning. "I don\'t think of him, mamma;\r\nnot particularly." "He is no better than anybody else that I can see,\r\nand he is beginning to give himself airs," said Mrs. Flood Jones.\r\nMary made no answer; but she went up into her room and swore before a\r\nfigure of the Virgin that she would be true to Phineas for ever and\r\never, in spite of her mother, in spite of all the world,--in spite,\r\nshould it be necessary, even of himself.\r\n\r\nAbout Christmas time there came a discussion between Phineas and his\r\nfather about money. "I hope you find you get on pretty well," said\r\nthe doctor, who thought that he had been liberal.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a tight fit," said Phineas,--who was less afraid of his father\r\nthan he had been when he last discussed these things.\r\n\r\n"I had hoped it would have been ample," said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t think for a moment, sir, that I am complaining," said Phineas.\r\n"I know it is much more than I have a right to expect."\r\n\r\nThe doctor began to make an inquiry within his own breast as to\r\nwhether his son had a right to expect anything;--whether the time\r\nhad not come in which his son should be earning his own bread. "I\r\nsuppose," he said, after a pause, "there is no chance of your doing\r\nanything at the bar now?"\r\n\r\n"Not immediately. It is almost impossible to combine the two studies\r\ntogether." Mr. Low himself was aware of that. "But you are not to\r\nsuppose that I have given the profession up."\r\n\r\n"I hope not,--after all the money it has cost us."\r\n\r\n"By no means, sir. And all that I am doing now will, I trust, be of\r\nassistance to me when I shall come back to work at the law. Of course\r\nit is on the cards that I may go into office,--and if so, public\r\nbusiness will become my profession."\r\n\r\n"And be turned out with the Ministry!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; that is true, sir. I must run my chance. If the worst comes to\r\nthe worst, I hope I might be able to secure some permanent place. I\r\nshould think that I can hardly fail to do so. But I trust I may never\r\nbe driven to want it. I thought, however, that we had settled all\r\nthis before." Then Phineas assumed a look of injured innocence, as\r\nthough his father was driving him too hard.\r\n\r\n"And in the mean time your money has been enough?" said the doctor,\r\nafter a pause.\r\n\r\n"I had intended to ask you to advance me a hundred pounds," said\r\nPhineas. "There were expenses to which I was driven on first entering\r\nParliament."\r\n\r\n"A hundred pounds."\r\n\r\n"If it be inconvenient, sir, I can do without it." He had not as\r\nyet paid for his gun, or for that velvet coat in which he had been\r\nshooting, or, most probably, for the knickerbockers. He knew he\r\nwanted the hundred pounds badly; but he felt ashamed of himself in\r\nasking for it. If he were once in office,--though the office were but\r\na sorry junior lordship,--he would repay his father instantly.\r\n\r\n"You shall have it, of course," said the doctor; "but do not let the\r\nnecessity for asking for more hundreds come oftener than you can\r\nhelp." Phineas said that he would not, and then there was no further\r\ndiscourse about money. It need hardly be said that he told his father\r\nnothing of that bill which he had endorsed for Laurence Fitzgibbon.\r\n\r\nAt last came the time which called him again to London and the\r\nglories of London life,--to lobbies, and the clubs, and the gossip of\r\nmen in office, and the chance of promotion for himself; to the glare\r\nof the gas-lamps, the mock anger of rival debaters, and the prospect\r\nof the Speaker\'s wig. During the idleness of the recess he had\r\nresolved at any rate upon this,--that a month of the session should\r\nnot have passed by before he had been seen upon his legs in the\r\nHouse,--had been seen and heard. And many a time as he had wandered\r\nalone, with his gun, across the bogs which lie on the other side of\r\nthe Shannon from Killaloe, he had practised the sort of address which\r\nhe would make to the House. He would be short,--always short; and he\r\nwould eschew all action and gesticulation; Mr. Monk had been very\r\nurgent in his instructions to him on that head; but he would be\r\nespecially careful that no words should escape him which had not in\r\nthem some purpose. He might be wrong in his purpose, but purpose\r\nthere should be. He had been twitted more than once at Killaloe\r\nwith his silence;--for it had been conceived by his fellow-townsmen\r\nthat he had been sent to Parliament on the special ground of his\r\neloquence. They should twit him no more on his next return. He would\r\nspeak and would carry the House with him if a human effort might\r\nprevail.\r\n\r\nSo he packed up his things, and started again for London in the\r\nbeginning of February. "Good-bye, Mary," he said with his sweetest\r\nsmile. But on this occasion there was no kiss, and no culling of\r\nlocks. "I know he cannot help it," said Mary to herself. "It is his\r\nposition. But whether it be for good or evil, I will be true to him."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid you are unhappy," Babara Finn said to her on the next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n"No; I am not unhappy,--not at all. I have a deal to make me happy\r\nand proud. I don\'t mean to be a bit unhappy." Then she turned away\r\nand cried heartily, and Barbara Finn cried with her for company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nPhineas Finn Returns to London\r\n\r\n\r\nPhineas had received two letters during his recess at Killaloe from\r\ntwo women who admired him much, which, as they were both short, shall\r\nbe submitted to the reader. The first was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Saulsby, October 20, 186--.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR MR. FINN,\r\n\r\n   I write a line to tell you that our marriage is to be\r\n   hurried on as quickly as possible. Mr. Kennedy does not\r\n   like to be absent from Parliament; nor will he be content\r\n   to postpone the ceremony till the session be over. The day\r\n   fixed is the 3rd of December, and we then go at once to\r\n   Rome, and intend to be back in London by the opening of\r\n   Parliament.\r\n\r\n   Yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\n   LAURA STANDISH.\r\n\r\n   Our London address will be No. 52, Grosvenor Place.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this he wrote an answer as short, expressing his ardent wishes\r\nthat those winter hymeneals might produce nothing but happiness, and\r\nsaying that he would not be in town many days before he knocked at\r\nthe door of No. 52, Grosvenor Place.\r\n\r\nAnd the second letter was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Great Marlborough Street, December, 186--.\r\n\r\n   DEAR AND HONOURED SIR,\r\n\r\n   Bunce is getting ever so anxious about the rooms, and\r\n   says as how he has a young Equity draftsman and wife and\r\n   baby as would take the whole house, and all because Miss\r\n   Pouncefoot said a word about her port wine, which any lady\r\n   of her age might say in her tantrums, and mean nothing\r\n   after all. Me and Miss Pouncefoot\'s knowed each other for\r\n   seven years, and what\'s a word or two as isn\'t meant after\r\n   that? But, honoured sir, it\'s not about that as I write\r\n   to trouble you, but to ask if I may say for certain that\r\n   you\'ll take the rooms again in February. It\'s easy to\r\n   let them for the month after Christmas, because of the\r\n   pantomimes. Only say at once, because Bunce is nagging\r\n   me day after day. I don\'t want nobody\'s wife and baby to\r\n   have to do for, and \'d sooner have a Parliament gent like\r\n   yourself than any one else.\r\n\r\n   Yours umbly and respectful,\r\n\r\n   JANE BUNCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this he replied that he would certainly come back to the rooms\r\nin Great Marlborough Street, should he be lucky enough to find them\r\nvacant, and he expressed his willingness to take them on and from\r\nthe 1st of February. And on the 3rd of February he found himself in\r\nthe old quarters, Mrs. Bunce having contrived, with much conjugal\r\nadroitness, both to keep Miss Pouncefoot and to stave off the Equity\r\ndraftsman\'s wife and baby. Bunce, however, received Phineas very\r\ncoldly, and told his wife the same evening that as far as he could\r\nsee their lodger would never turn up to be a trump in the matter of\r\nthe ballot. "If he means well, why did he go and stay with them lords\r\ndown in Scotland? I knows all about it. I knows a man when I sees\r\nhim. Mr. Low, who\'s looking out to be a Tory judge some of these\r\ndays, is a deal better;--because he knows what he\'s after."\r\n\r\nImmediately on his return to town, Phineas found himself summoned to\r\na political meeting at Mr. Mildmay\'s house in St. James\'s Square.\r\n"We\'re going to begin in earnest this time," Barrington Erle said to\r\nhim at the club.\r\n\r\n"I am glad of that," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you heard all about it down at Loughlinter?"\r\n\r\nNow, in truth, Phineas had heard very little of any settled plan down\r\nat Loughlinter. He had played a game of chess with Mr. Gresham, and\r\nhad shot a stag with Mr. Palliser, and had discussed sheep with Lord\r\nBrentford, but had hardly heard a word about politics from any one\r\nof those influential gentlemen. From Mr. Monk he had heard much of a\r\ncoming Reform Bill; but his communications with Mr. Monk had rather\r\nbeen private discussions,--in which he had learned Mr. Monk\'s own\r\nviews on certain points,--than revelations on the intention of the\r\nparty to which Mr. Monk belonged. "I heard of nothing settled," said\r\nPhineas; "but I suppose we are to have a Reform Bill."\r\n\r\n"That is a matter of course."\r\n\r\n"And I suppose we are not to touch the question of ballot."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the difficulty," said Barrington Erle. "But of course we\r\nshan\'t touch it as long as Mr. Mildmay is in the Cabinet. He will\r\nnever consent to the ballot as First Minister of the Crown."\r\n\r\n"Nor would Gresham, or Palliser," said Phineas, who did not choose to\r\nbring forward his greatest gun at first.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about Gresham. It is impossible to say what Gresham\r\nmight bring himself to do. Gresham is a man who may go any lengths\r\nbefore he has done. Planty Pall,"--for such was the name by which Mr.\r\nPlantagenet Palliser was ordinarily known among his friends,--"would\r\nof course go with Mr. Mildmay and the Duke."\r\n\r\n"And Monk is opposed to the ballot," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s the question. No doubt he has assented to the proposition\r\nof a measure without the ballot; but if there should come a row, and\r\nmen like Turnbull demand it, and the London mob kick up a shindy, I\r\ndon\'t know how far Monk would be steady."\r\n\r\n"Whatever he says, he\'ll stick to."\r\n\r\n"He is your leader, then?" asked Barrington.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that I have a leader. Mr. Mildmay leads our side; and\r\nif anybody leads me, he does. But I have great faith in Mr. Monk."\r\n\r\n"There\'s one who would go for the ballot to-morrow, if it were\r\nbrought forward stoutly," said Barrington Erle to Mr. Ratler a few\r\nminutes afterwards, pointing to Phineas as he spoke.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think much of that young man," said Ratler.\r\n\r\nMr. Bonteen and Mr. Ratler had put their heads together during that\r\nlast evening at Loughlinter, and had agreed that they did not think\r\nmuch of Phineas Finn. Why did Mr. Kennedy go down off the mountain\r\nto get him a pony? And why did Mr. Gresham play chess with him? Mr.\r\nRatler and Mr. Bonteen may have been right in making up their minds\r\nto think but little of Phineas Finn, but Barrington Erle had been\r\nquite wrong when he had said that Phineas would "go for the ballot"\r\nto-morrow. Phineas had made up his mind very strongly that he would\r\nalways oppose the ballot. That he would hold the same opinion\r\nthroughout his life, no one should pretend to say; but in his present\r\nmood, and under the tuition which he had received from Mr. Monk,\r\nhe was prepared to demonstrate, out of the House and in it, that\r\nthe ballot was, as a political measure, unmanly, ineffective, and\r\nenervating. Enervating had been a great word with Mr. Monk, and\r\nPhineas had clung to it with admiration.\r\n\r\nThe meeting took place at Mr. Mildmay\'s on the third day of the\r\nsession. Phineas had of course heard of such meetings before, but had\r\nnever attended one. Indeed, there had been no such gathering when\r\nMr. Mildmay\'s party came into power early in the last session. Mr.\r\nMildmay and his men had then made their effort in turning out their\r\nopponents, and had been well pleased to rest awhile upon their oars.\r\nNow, however, they must go again to work, and therefore the liberal\r\nparty was collected at Mr. Mildmay\'s house, in order that the liberal\r\nparty might be told what it was that Mr. Mildmay and his Cabinet\r\nintended to do.\r\n\r\nPhineas Finn was quite in the dark as to what would be the nature\r\nof the performance on this occasion, and entertained some idea that\r\nevery gentleman present would be called upon to express individually\r\nhis assent or dissent in regard to the measure proposed. He walked to\r\nSt. James\'s Square with Laurence Fitzgibbon; but even with Fitzgibbon\r\nwas ashamed to show his ignorance by asking questions. "After all,"\r\nsaid Fitzgibbon, "this kind of thing means nothing. I know as well as\r\npossible, and so do you, what Mr. Mildmay will say,--and then Gresham\r\nwill say a few words; and then Turnbull will make a murmur, and then\r\nwe shall all assent,--to anything or to nothing;--and then it will be\r\nover." Still Phineas did not understand whether the assent required\r\nwould or would not be an individual personal assent. When the affair\r\nwas over he found that he was disappointed, and that he might almost\r\nas well have stayed away from the meeting,--except that he had\r\nattended at Mr. Mildmay\'s bidding, and had given a silent adhesion to\r\nMr. Mildmay\'s plan of reform for that session. Laurence Fitzgibbon\r\nhad been very nearly correct in his description of what would occur.\r\nMr. Mildmay made a long speech. Mr. Turnbull, the great Radical of\r\nthe day,--the man who was supposed to represent what many called the\r\nManchester school of politics,--asked half a dozen questions. In\r\nanswer to these Mr. Gresham made a short speech. Then Mr. Mildmay\r\nmade another speech, and then all was over. The gist of the whole\r\nthing was, that there should be a Reform Bill,--very generous in its\r\nenlargement of the franchise,--but no ballot. Mr. Turnbull expressed\r\nhis doubt whether this would be satisfactory to the country; but even\r\nMr. Turnbull was soft in his tone and complaisant in his manner. As\r\nthere was no reporter present,--that plan of turning private meetings\r\nat gentlemen\'s houses into public assemblies not having been as yet\r\nadopted,--there could be no need for energy or violence. They went to\r\nMr. Mildmay\'s house to hear Mr. Mildmay\'s plan,--and they heard it.\r\n\r\nTwo days after this Phineas was to dine with Mr. Monk. Mr. Monk had\r\nasked him in the lobby of the House. "I don\'t give dinner parties,"\r\nhe said, "but I should like you to come and meet Mr. Turnbull."\r\nPhineas accepted the invitation as a matter of course. There were\r\nmany who said that Mr. Turnbull was the greatest man in the nation,\r\nand that the nation could be saved only by a direct obedience to\r\nMr. Turnbull\'s instructions. Others said that Mr. Turnbull was a\r\ndemagogue and at heart a rebel; that he was un-English, false and\r\nvery dangerous. Phineas was rather inclined to believe the latter\r\nstatement; and as danger and dangerous men are always more attractive\r\nthan safety and safe men, he was glad to have an opportunity of\r\nmeeting Mr. Turnbull at dinner.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime he went to call on Lady Laura, whom he had not\r\nseen since the last evening which he spent in her company at\r\nLoughlinter,--whom, when he was last speaking to her, he had kissed\r\nclose beneath the falls of the Linter. He found her at home, and with\r\nher was her husband. "Here is a Darby and Joan meeting, is it not?"\r\nshe said, getting up to welcome him. He had seen Mr. Kennedy before,\r\nand had been standing close to him during the meeting at Mr.\r\nMildmay\'s.\r\n\r\n"I am very glad to find you both together."\r\n\r\n"But Robert is going away this instant," said Lady Laura. "Has he\r\ntold you of our adventures at Rome?"\r\n\r\n"Not a word."\r\n\r\n"Then I must tell you;--but not now. The dear old Pope was so civil\r\nto us. I came to think it quite a pity that he should be in trouble."\r\n\r\n"I must be off," said the husband, getting up. "But I shall meet you\r\nat dinner, I believe."\r\n\r\n"Do you dine at Mr. Monk\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and am asked expressly to hear Turnbull make a convert of you.\r\nThere are only to be us four. Au revoir." Then Mr. Kennedy went, and\r\nPhineas found himself alone with Lady Laura. He hardly knew how to\r\naddress her, and remained silent. He had not prepared himself for the\r\ninterview as he ought to have done, and felt himself to be awkward.\r\nShe evidently expected him to speak, and for a few seconds sat\r\nwaiting for what he might say.\r\n\r\nAt last she found that it was incumbent on her to begin. "Were you\r\nsurprised at our suddenness when you got my note?"\r\n\r\n"A little. You had spoken of waiting."\r\n\r\n"I had never imagined that he would have been impetuous. And he seems\r\nto think that even the business of getting himself married would not\r\njustify him staying away from Parliament. He is a rigid martinet in\r\nall matters of duty."\r\n\r\n"I did not wonder that he should be in a hurry, but that you should\r\nsubmit."\r\n\r\n"I told you that I should do just what the wise people told me. I\r\nasked papa, and he said that it would be better. So the lawyers were\r\ndriven out of their minds, and the milliners out of their bodies, and\r\nthe thing was done."\r\n\r\n"Who was there at the marriage?"\r\n\r\n"Oswald was not there. That I know is what you mean to ask. Papa said\r\nthat he might come if he pleased. Oswald stipulated that he should be\r\nreceived as a son. Then my father spoke the hardest word that ever\r\nfell from his mouth."\r\n\r\n"What did he say?"\r\n\r\n"I will not repeat it,--not altogether. But he said that Oswald was\r\nnot entitled to a son\'s treatment. He was very sore about my money,\r\nbecause Robert was so generous as to his settlement. So the breach\r\nbetween them is as wide as ever."\r\n\r\n"And where is Chiltern now?" said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Down in Northamptonshire, staying at some inn from whence he hunts.\r\nHe tells me that he is quite alone,--that he never dines out, never\r\nhas any one to dine with him, that he hunts five or six days a\r\nweek,--and reads at night."\r\n\r\n"That is not a bad sort of life."\r\n\r\n"Not if the reading is any good. But I cannot bear that he should be\r\nso solitary. And if he breaks down in it, then his companions will\r\nnot be fit for him. Do you ever hunt?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes,--at home in county Clare. All Irishmen hunt."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would go down to him and see him. He would be delighted\r\nto have you."\r\n\r\nPhineas thought over the proposition before he answered it, and then\r\nmade the reply that he had made once before. "I would do so, Lady\r\nLaura,--but that I have no money for hunting in England."\r\n\r\n"Alas, alas!" said she, smiling. "How that hits one on every side!"\r\n\r\n"I might manage it,--for a couple of days,--in March."\r\n\r\n"Do not do what you think you ought not to do," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"No; certainly. But I should like it, and if I can I will."\r\n\r\n"He could mount you, I have no doubt. He has no other expense now,\r\nand keeps a stable full of horses. I think he has seven or eight. And\r\nnow tell me, Mr. Finn; when are you going to charm the House? Or is\r\nit your first intention to strike terror?"\r\n\r\nHe blushed,--he knew that he blushed as he answered. "Oh, I suppose I\r\nshall make some sort of attempt before long. I can\'t bear the idea of\r\nbeing a bore."\r\n\r\n"I think you ought to speak, Mr. Finn."\r\n\r\n"I do not know about that, but I certainly mean to try. There will be\r\nlots of opportunities about the new Reform Bill. Of course you know\r\nthat Mr. Mildmay is going to bring it in at once. You hear all that\r\nfrom Mr. Kennedy."\r\n\r\n"And papa has told me. I still see papa almost every day. You must\r\ncall upon him. Mind you do." Phineas said that he certainly would.\r\n"Papa is very lonely now, and I sometimes feel that I have been\r\nalmost cruel in deserting him. And I think that he has a horror of\r\nthe house,--especially later in the year,--always fancying that he\r\nwill meet Oswald. I am so unhappy about it all, Mr. Finn."\r\n\r\n"Why doesn\'t your brother marry?" said Phineas, knowing nothing as\r\nyet of Lord Chiltern and Violet Effingham. "If he were to marry well,\r\nthat would bring your father round."\r\n\r\n"Yes,--it would."\r\n\r\n"And why should he not?"\r\n\r\nLady Laura paused before she answered; and then she told the whole\r\nstory. "He is violently in love, and the girl he loves has refused\r\nhim twice."\r\n\r\n"Is it with Miss Effingham?" asked Phineas, guessing the truth at\r\nonce, and remembering what Miss Effingham had said to him when riding\r\nin the wood.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--with Violet Effingham; my father\'s pet, his favourite, whom he\r\nloves next to myself,--almost as well as myself; whom he would really\r\nwelcome as a daughter. He would gladly make her mistress of his\r\nhouse, and of Saulsby. Everything would then go smoothly."\r\n\r\n"But she does not like Lord Chiltern?"\r\n\r\n"I believe she loves him in her heart; but she is afraid of him. As\r\nshe says herself, a girl is bound to be so careful of herself. With\r\nall her seeming frolic, Violet Effingham is very wise."\r\n\r\nPhineas, though not conscious of anything akin to jealousy, was\r\nannoyed at the revelation made to him. Since he had heard that Lord\r\nChiltern was in love with Miss Effingham, he did not like Lord\r\nChiltern quite as well as he had done before. He himself had simply\r\nadmired Miss Effingham, and had taken pleasure in her society; but,\r\nthough this had been all, he did not like to hear of another man\r\nwanting to marry her, and he was almost angry with Lady Laura for\r\nsaying that she believed Miss Effingham loved her brother. If Miss\r\nEffingham had twice refused Lord Chiltern, that ought to have been\r\nsufficient. It was not that Phineas was in love with Miss Effingham\r\nhimself. As he was still violently in love with Lady Laura, any other\r\nlove was of course impossible; but, nevertheless, there was something\r\noffensive to him in the story as it had been told. "If it be wisdom\r\non her part," said he, answering Lady Laura\'s last words, "you cannot\r\nfind fault with her for her decision."\r\n\r\n"I find no fault;--but I think my brother would make her happy."\r\n\r\nLady Laura, when she was left alone, at once reverted to the tone in\r\nwhich Phineas Finn had answered her remarks about Miss Effingham.\r\nPhineas was very ill able to conceal his thoughts, and wore his heart\r\nalmost upon his sleeve. "Can it be possible that he cares for her\r\nhimself?" That was the nature of Lady Laura\'s first question to\r\nherself upon the matter. And in asking herself that question, she\r\nthought nothing of the disparity in rank or fortune between Phineas\r\nFinn and Violet Effingham. Nor did it occur to her as at all\r\nimprobable that Violet might accept the love of him who had so lately\r\nbeen her own lover. But the idea grated against her wishes on two\r\nsides. She was most anxious that Violet should ultimately become her\r\nbrother\'s wife,--and she could not be pleased that Phineas should be\r\nable to love any woman.\r\n\r\nI must beg my readers not to be carried away by those last words\r\ninto any erroneous conclusion. They must not suppose that Lady Laura\r\nKennedy, the lately married bride, indulged a guilty passion for the\r\nyoung man who had loved her. Though she had probably thought often\r\nof Phineas Finn since her marriage, her thoughts had never been of\r\na nature to disturb her rest. It had never occurred to her even to\r\nthink that she regarded him with any feeling that was an offence\r\nto her husband. She would have hated herself had any such idea\r\npresented itself to her mind. She prided herself on being a pure\r\nhigh-principled woman, who had kept so strong a guard upon herself as\r\nto be nearly free from the dangers of those rocks upon which other\r\nwomen made shipwreck of their happiness. She took pride in this, and\r\nwould then blame herself for her own pride. But though she so blamed\r\nherself, it never occurred to her to think that to her there might be\r\ndanger of such shipwreck. She had put away from herself the idea of\r\nlove when she had first perceived that Phineas had regarded her with\r\nmore than friendship, and had accepted Mr. Kennedy\'s offer with an\r\nassured conviction that by doing so she was acting best for her own\r\nhappiness and for that of all those concerned. She had felt the\r\nromance of the position to be sweet when Phineas had stood with her\r\nat the top of the falls of the Linter, and had told her of the hopes\r\nwhich he had dared to indulge. And when at the bottom of the falls he\r\nhad presumed to take her in his arms, she had forgiven him without\r\ndifficulty to herself, telling herself that that would be the alpha\r\nand the omega of the romance of her life. She had not felt herself\r\nbound to tell Mr. Kennedy of what had occurred,--but she had felt\r\nthat he could hardly have been angry even had he been told. And she\r\nhad often thought of her lover since, and of his love,--telling\r\nherself that she too had once had a lover, never regarding her\r\nhusband in that light; but her thoughts had not frightened her as\r\nguilty thoughts will do. There had come a romance which had been\r\npleasant, and it was gone. It had been soon banished,--but it\r\nhad left to her a sweet flavour, of which she loved to taste the\r\nsweetness though she knew that it was gone. And the man should be her\r\nfriend, but especially her husband\'s friend. It should be her care to\r\nsee that his life was successful,--and especially her husband\'s care.\r\nIt was a great delight to her to know that her husband liked the man.\r\nAnd the man would marry, and the man\'s wife should be her friend. All\r\nthis had been very pure and very pleasant. Now an idea had flitted\r\nacross her brain that the man was in love with some one else,--and\r\nshe did not like it!\r\n\r\nBut she did not therefore become afraid of herself, or in the least\r\nrealise at once the danger of her own position. Her immediate glance\r\nat the matter did not go beyond the falseness of men. If it were so,\r\nas she suspected,--if Phineas had in truth transferred his affections\r\nto Violet Effingham, of how little value was the love of such a man!\r\nIt did not occur to her at this moment that she also had transferred\r\nhers to Robert Kennedy, or that, if not, she had done worse. But she\r\ndid remember that in the autumn this young Phoebus among men had\r\nturned his back upon her out upon the mountain that he might hide\r\nfrom her the agony of his heart when he learned that she was to be\r\nthe wife of another man; and that now, before the winter was over, he\r\ncould not hide from her the fact that his heart was elsewhere! And\r\nthen she speculated, and counted up facts, and satisfied herself that\r\nPhineas could not even have seen Violet Effingham since they two had\r\nstood together upon the mountain. How false are men!--how false and\r\nhow weak of heart!\r\n\r\n"Chiltern and Violet Effingham!" said Phineas to himself, as he\r\nwalked away from Grosvenor Place. "Is it fair that she should be\r\nsacrificed because she is rich, and because she is so winning and so\r\nfascinating that Lord Brentford would receive even his son for the\r\nsake of receiving also such a daughter-in-law?" Phineas also liked\r\nLord Chiltern; had seen or fancied that he had seen fine things in\r\nhim; had looked forward to his regeneration, hoping, perhaps, that he\r\nmight have some hand in the good work. But he did not recognise the\r\npropriety of sacrificing Violet Effingham even for work so good as\r\nthis. If Miss Effingham had refused Lord Chiltern twice, surely that\r\nought to be sufficient. It did not occur to him that the love of such\r\na girl as Violet would be a great treasure--to himself. As regarded\r\nhimself, he was still in love,--hopelessly in love, with Lady Laura\r\nKennedy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nMr. Turnbull\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a Wednesday evening and there was no House;--and at seven\r\no\'clock Phineas was at Mr. Monk\'s hall door. He was the first of the\r\nguests, and he found Mr. Monk alone in the dining-room. "I am doing\r\nbutler," said Mr. Monk, who had a brace of decanters in his hands,\r\nwhich he proceeded to put down in the neighbourhood of the fire.\r\n"But I have finished, and now we will go up-stairs to receive the\r\ntwo great men properly."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon for coming too early," said Finn.\r\n\r\n"Not a minute too early. Seven is seven, and it is I who am too late.\r\nBut, Lord bless you, you don\'t think I\'m ashamed of being found in\r\nthe act of decanting my own wine! I remember Lord Palmerston saying\r\nbefore some committee about salaries, five or six years ago now, I\r\ndaresay, that it wouldn\'t do for an English Minister to have his hall\r\ndoor opened by a maid-servant. Now, I\'m an English Minister, and\r\nI\'ve got nobody but a maid-servant to open my hall door, and I\'m\r\nobliged to look after my own wine. I wonder whether it\'s improper? I\r\nshouldn\'t like to be the means of injuring the British Constitution."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps if you resign soon, and if nobody follows your example,\r\ngrave evil results may be avoided."\r\n\r\n"I sincerely hope so, for I do love the British Constitution; and I\r\nlove also the respect in which members of the English Cabinet are\r\nheld. Now Turnbull, who will be here in a moment, hates it all; but\r\nhe is a rich man, and has more powdered footmen hanging about his\r\nhouse than ever Lord Palmerston had himself."\r\n\r\n"He is still in business."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;--and makes his thirty thousand a year. Here he is. How are\r\nyou, Turnbull? We were talking about my maid-servant. I hope she\r\nopened the door for you properly."\r\n\r\n"Certainly,--as far as I perceived," said Mr. Turnbull, who was\r\nbetter at a speech than a joke. "A very respectable young woman I\r\nshould say."\r\n\r\n"There is not one more so in all London," said Mr. Monk; "but Finn\r\nseems to think that I ought to have a man in livery."\r\n\r\n"It is a matter of perfect indifference to me," said Mr. Turnbull.\r\n"I am one of those who never think of such things."\r\n\r\n"Nor I either," said Mr. Monk. Then the laird of Loughlinter was\r\nannounced, and they all went down to dinner.\r\n\r\nMr. Turnbull was a good-looking robust man about sixty, with long\r\ngrey hair and a red complexion, with hard eyes, a well-cut nose, and\r\nfull lips. He was nearly six feet high, stood quite upright, and\r\nalways wore a black swallow-tail coat, black trousers, and a black\r\nsilk waistcoat. In the House, at least, he was always so dressed, and\r\nat dinner tables. What difference there might be in his costume when\r\nat home at Staleybridge few of those who saw him in London had the\r\nmeans of knowing. There was nothing in his face to indicate special\r\ntalent. No one looking at him would take him to be a fool; but there\r\nwas none of the fire of genius in his eye, nor was there in the lines\r\nof his mouth any of that play of thought or fancy which is generally\r\nto be found in the faces of men and women who have made themselves\r\ngreat. Mr. Turnbull had certainly made himself great, and could\r\nhardly have done so without force of intellect. He was one of the\r\nmost popular, if not the most popular politician in the country. Poor\r\nmen believed in him, thinking that he was their most honest public\r\nfriend; and men who were not poor believed in his power, thinking\r\nthat his counsels must surely prevail. He had obtained the ear of the\r\nHouse and the favour of the reporters, and opened his voice at no\r\npublic dinner, on no public platform, without a conviction that the\r\nwords spoken by him would be read by thousands. The first necessity\r\nfor good speaking is a large audience; and of this advantage Mr.\r\nTurnbull had made himself sure. And yet it could hardly be said that\r\nhe was a great orator. He was gifted with a powerful voice, with\r\nstrong, and I may, perhaps, call them broad convictions, with perfect\r\nself-reliance, with almost unlimited powers of endurance, with hot\r\nambition, with no keen scruples, and with a moral skin of great\r\nthickness. Nothing said against him pained him, no attacks wounded\r\nhim, no raillery touched him in the least. There was not a sore spot\r\nabout him, and probably his first thoughts on waking every morning\r\ntold him that he, at least, was totus teres atque rotundus. He was,\r\nof course, a thorough Radical,--and so was Mr. Monk. But Mr. Monk\'s\r\nfirst waking thoughts were probably exactly the reverse of those\r\nof his friend. Mr. Monk was a much hotter man in debate than Mr.\r\nTurnbull;--but Mr. Monk was ever doubting of himself, and never\r\ndoubted of himself so much as when he had been most violent, and\r\nalso most effective, in debate. When Mr. Monk jeered at himself for\r\nbeing a Cabinet Minister and keeping no attendant grander than a\r\nparlour-maid, there was a substratum of self-doubt under the joke.\r\n\r\nMr. Turnbull was certainly a great Radical, and as such enjoyed a\r\ngreat reputation. I do not think that high office in the State had\r\never been offered to him; but things had been said which justified\r\nhim, or seemed to himself to justify him, in declaring that in\r\nno possible circumstances would he serve the Crown. "I serve the\r\npeople," he had said, "and much as I respect the servants of the\r\nCrown, I think that my own office is the higher." He had been greatly\r\ncalled to task for this speech; and Mr. Mildmay, the present Premier,\r\nhad asked him whether he did not recognise the so-called servants of\r\nthe Crown as the most hard-worked and truest servants of the people.\r\nThe House and the press had supported Mr. Mildmay, but to all that\r\nMr. Turnbull was quite indifferent; and when an assertion made by him\r\nbefore three or four thousand persons at Manchester, to the effect\r\nthat he,--he specially,--was the friend and servant of the people,\r\nwas received with acclamation, he felt quite satisfied that he had\r\ngained his point. Progressive reform in the franchise, of which\r\nmanhood suffrage should be the acknowledged and not far distant end,\r\nequal electoral districts, ballot, tenant right for England as well\r\nas Ireland, reduction of the standing army till there should be no\r\nstanding army to reduce, utter disregard of all political movements\r\nin Europe, an almost idolatrous admiration for all political\r\nmovements in America, free trade in everything except malt, and\r\nan absolute extinction of a State Church,--these were among the\r\nprincipal articles in Mr. Turnbull\'s political catalogue. And I\r\nthink that when once he had learned the art of arranging his words\r\nas he stood upon his legs, and had so mastered his voice as to\r\nhave obtained the ear of the House, the work of his life was not\r\ndifficult. Having nothing to construct, he could always deal with\r\ngeneralities. Being free from responsibility, he was not called upon\r\neither to study details or to master even great facts. It was his\r\nbusiness to inveigh against existing evils, and perhaps there is\r\nno easier business when once the privilege of an audience has been\r\nattained. It was his work to cut down forest-trees, and he had\r\nnothing to do with the subsequent cultivation of the land. Mr.\r\nMonk had once told Phineas Finn how great were the charms of that\r\ninaccuracy which was permitted to the Opposition. Mr. Turnbull no\r\ndoubt enjoyed these charms to the full, though he would sooner have\r\nput a padlock on his mouth for a month than have owned as much. Upon\r\nthe whole, Mr. Turnbull was no doubt right in resolving that he would\r\nnot take office, though some reticence on that subject might have\r\nbeen more becoming to him.\r\n\r\nThe conversation at dinner, though it was altogether on political\r\nsubjects, had in it nothing of special interest as long as the girl\r\nwas there to change the plates; but when she was gone, and the door\r\nwas closed, it gradually opened out, and there came on to be a\r\npleasant sparring match between the two great Radicals,--the Radical\r\nwho had joined himself to the governing powers, and the Radical who\r\nstood aloof. Mr. Kennedy barely said a word now and then, and Phineas\r\nwas almost as silent as Mr. Kennedy. He had come there to hear some\r\nsuch discussion, and was quite willing to listen while guns of such\r\ngreat calibre were being fired off for his amusement.\r\n\r\n"I think Mr. Mildmay is making a great step forward," said Mr.\r\nTurnbull.\r\n\r\n"I think he is," said Mr. Monk.\r\n\r\n"I did not believe that he would ever live to go so far. It will\r\nhardly suffice even for this year; but still coming from him, it is\r\na great deal. It only shows how far a man may be made to go, if only\r\nthe proper force be applied. After all, it matters very little who\r\nare the Ministers."\r\n\r\n"That is what I have always declared," said Mr. Monk.\r\n\r\n"Very little indeed. We don\'t mind whether it be Lord de Terrier, or\r\nMr. Mildmay, or Mr. Gresham, or you yourself, if you choose to get\r\nyourself made First Lord of the Treasury."\r\n\r\n"I have no such ambition, Turnbull."\r\n\r\n"I should have thought you had. If I went in for that kind of thing\r\nmyself, I should like to go to the top of the ladder. I should feel\r\nthat if I could do any good at all by becoming a Minister, I could\r\nonly do it by becoming first Minister."\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t doubt your own fitness for such a position?"\r\n\r\n"I doubt my fitness for the position of any Minister," said Mr.\r\nTurnbull.\r\n\r\n"You mean that on other grounds," said Mr. Kennedy.\r\n\r\n"I mean it on every ground," said Mr. Turnbull, rising on his legs\r\nand standing with his back to the fire. "Of course I am not fit to\r\nhave diplomatic intercourse with men who would come to me simply with\r\nthe desire of deceiving me. Of course I am unfit to deal with members\r\nof Parliament who would flock around me because they wanted places.\r\nOf course I am unfit to answer every man\'s question so as to give no\r\ninformation to any one."\r\n\r\n"Could you not answer them so as to give information?" said Mr.\r\nKennedy.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Turnbull was so intent on his speech that it may be doubted\r\nwhether he heard this interruption. He took no notice of it as he\r\nwent on. "Of course I am unfit to maintain the proprieties of a\r\nseeming confidence between a Crown all-powerless and a people\r\nall-powerful. No man recognises his own unfitness for such work more\r\nclearly than I do, Mr. Monk. But if I took in hand such work at all,\r\nI should like to be the leader, and not the led. Tell us fairly, now,\r\nwhat are your convictions worth in Mr. Mildmay\'s Cabinet?"\r\n\r\n"That is a question which a man may hardly answer himself," said Mr.\r\nMonk.\r\n\r\n"It is a question which a man should at least answer for himself\r\nbefore he consents to sit there," said Mr. Turnbull, in a tone of\r\nvoice which was almost angry.\r\n\r\n"And what reason have you for supposing that I have omitted that\r\nduty?" said Mr. Monk.\r\n\r\n"Simply this,--that I cannot reconcile your known opinions with the\r\npractices of your colleagues."\r\n\r\n"I will not tell you what my convictions may be worth in Mr.\r\nMildmay\'s Cabinet. I will not take upon myself to say that they are\r\nworth the chair on which I sit when I am there. But I will tell you\r\nwhat my aspirations were when I consented to fill that chair, and you\r\nshall judge of their worth. I thought that they might possibly leaven\r\nthe batch of bread which we have to bake,--giving to the whole batch\r\nmore of the flavour of reform than it would have possessed had I\r\nabsented myself. I thought that when I was asked to join Mr. Mildmay\r\nand Mr. Gresham, the very fact of that request indicated liberal\r\nprogress, and that if I refused the request I should be declining to\r\nassist in good work."\r\n\r\n"You could have supported them, if anything were proposed worthy of\r\nsupport," said Mr. Turnbull.\r\n\r\n"Yes; but I could not have been so effective in taking care that\r\nsome measure be proposed worthy of support as I may possibly be now.\r\nI thought a good deal about it, and I believe that my decision was\r\nright."\r\n\r\n"I am sure you were right," said Mr. Kennedy.\r\n\r\n"There can be no juster object of ambition than a seat in the\r\nCabinet," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Sir, I must dispute that," said Mr. Turnbull, turning round upon our\r\nhero. "I regard the position of our high Ministers as most\r\nrespectable."\r\n\r\n"Thank you for so much," said Mr. Monk. But the orator went on again,\r\nregardless of the interruption:--\r\n\r\n"The position of gentlemen in inferior offices,--of gentlemen who\r\nattend rather to the nods and winks of their superiors in Downing\r\nStreet than to the interest of their constituents,--I do not regard\r\nas being highly respectable."\r\n\r\n"A man cannot begin at the top," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Our friend Mr. Monk has begun at what you are pleased to call the\r\ntop," said Mr. Turnbull. "But I will not profess to think that even\r\nhe has raised himself by going into office. To be an independent\r\nrepresentative of a really popular commercial constituency is, in my\r\nestimation, the highest object of an Englishman\'s ambition."\r\n\r\n"But why commercial, Mr. Turnbull?" said Mr. Kennedy.\r\n\r\n"Because the commercial constituencies really do elect their own\r\nmembers in accordance with their own judgments, whereas the counties\r\nand the small towns are coerced either by individuals or by a\r\ncombination of aristocratic influences."\r\n\r\n"And yet," said Mr. Kennedy, "there are not half a dozen\r\nConservatives returned by all the counties in Scotland."\r\n\r\n"Scotland is very much to be honoured," said Mr. Turnbull.\r\n\r\nMr. Kennedy was the first to take his departure, and Mr. Turnbull\r\nfollowed him very quickly. Phineas got up to go at the same time, but\r\nstayed at his host\'s request, and sat for awhile smoking a cigar.\r\n\r\n"Turnbull is a wonderful man," said Mr. Monk.\r\n\r\n"Does he not domineer too much?"\r\n\r\n"His fault is not arrogance, so much as ignorance that there is,\r\nor should be, a difference between public and private life. In the\r\nHouse of Commons a man in Mr. Turnbull\'s position must speak with\r\ndictatorial assurance. He is always addressing, not the House only,\r\nbut the country at large, and the country will not believe in him\r\nunless he believe in himself. But he forgets that he is not always\r\naddressing the country at large. I wonder what sort of a time Mrs.\r\nTurnbull and the little Turnbulls have of it?"\r\n\r\nPhineas, as he went home, made up his mind that Mrs. Turnbull and\r\nthe little Turnbulls must probably have a bad time of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nLord Chiltern Rides His Horse Bonebreaker\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was known that whatever might be the details of Mr. Mildmay\'s\r\nbill, the ballot would not form a part of it; and as there was a\r\nstrong party in the House of Commons, and a very numerous party out\r\nof it, who were desirous that voting by ballot should be made a part\r\nof the electoral law, it was decided that an independent motion\r\nshould be brought on in anticipation of Mr. Mildmay\'s bill. The\r\narrangement was probably one of Mr. Mildmay\'s own making; so that\r\nhe might be hampered by no opposition on that subject by his own\r\nfollowers if,--as he did not doubt,--the motion should be lost.\r\nIt was expected that the debate would not last over one night,\r\nand Phineas resolved that he would make his maiden speech on this\r\noccasion. He had very strong opinions as to the inefficacy of the\r\nballot for any good purposes, and thought that he might be able to\r\nstrike out from his convictions some sparks of that fire which used\r\nto be so plentiful with him at the old debating clubs. But even at\r\nbreakfast that morning his heart began to beat quickly at the idea\r\nof having to stand on his legs before so critical an audience.\r\n\r\nHe knew that it would be well that he should if possible get the\r\nsubject off his mind during the day, and therefore went out among the\r\npeople who certainly would not talk to him about the ballot. He sat\r\nfor nearly an hour in the morning with Mr. Low, and did not even tell\r\nMr. Low that it was his intention to speak on that day. Then he made\r\none or two other calls, and at about three went up to Portman Square\r\nto look for Lord Chiltern. It was now nearly the end of February, and\r\nPhineas had often seen Lady Laura. He had not seen her brother, but\r\nhad learned from his sister that he had been driven up to London by\r\nthe frost, He was told by the porter at Lord Brentford\'s that Lord\r\nChiltern was in the house, and as he was passing through the hall he\r\nmet Lord Brentford himself. He was thus driven to speak, and felt\r\nhimself called upon to explain why he was there. "I am come to see\r\nLord Chiltern," he said.\r\n\r\n"Is Lord Chiltern in the house?" said the Earl, turning to the\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my lord; his lordship arrived last night."\r\n\r\n"You will find him upstairs, I suppose," said the Earl. "For myself\r\nI know nothing of him." He spoke in an angry tone, as though he\r\nresented the fact that any one should come to his house to call upon\r\nhis son; and turned his back quickly upon Phineas. But he thought\r\nbetter of it before he reached the front door, and turned again.\r\n"By-the-bye," said he, "what majority shall we have to-night, Finn?"\r\n\r\n"Pretty nearly as many as you please to name, my lord," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Well;--yes; I suppose we are tolerably safe. You ought to speak upon\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I may," said Phineas, feeling that he blushed as he spoke.\r\n\r\n"Do," said the Earl. "Do. If you see Lord Chiltern will you tell him\r\nfrom me that I should be glad to see him before he leaves London. I\r\nshall be at home till noon to-morrow." Phineas, much astonished at\r\nthe commission given to him, of course said that he would do as he\r\nwas desired, and then passed on to Lord Chiltern\'s apartments.\r\n\r\nHe found his friend standing in the middle of the room, without coat\r\nand waistcoat, with a pair of dumb-bells in his hands. "When there\'s\r\nno hunting I\'m driven to this kind of thing," said Lord Chiltern.\r\n\r\n"I suppose it\'s good exercise," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"And it gives me something to do. When I\'m in London I feel like a\r\ngipsy in church, till the time comes for prowling out at night. I\'ve\r\nno occupation for my days whatever, and no place to which I can take\r\nmyself. I can\'t stand in a club window as some men do, and I should\r\ndisgrace any decent club if I did stand there. I belong to the\r\nTravellers, but I doubt whether the porter would let me go in."\r\n\r\n"I think you pique yourself on being more of an outer Bohemian than\r\nyou are," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"I pique myself on this, that whether Bohemian or not, I will go\r\nnowhere that I am not wanted. Though,--for the matter of that, I\r\nsuppose I\'m not wanted here." Then Phineas gave him the message from\r\nhis father. "He wishes to see me to-morrow morning?" continued Lord\r\nChiltern. "Let him send me word what it is he has to say to me. I do\r\nnot choose to be insulted by him, though he is my father."\r\n\r\n"I would certainly go, if I were you."\r\n\r\n"I doubt it very much, if all the circumstances were the same. Let\r\nhim tell me what he wants."\r\n\r\n"Of course I cannot ask him, Chiltern."\r\n\r\n"I know what he wants very well. Laura has been interfering and doing\r\nno good. You know Violet Effingham?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I know her," said Phineas, much surprised.\r\n\r\n"They want her to marry me."\r\n\r\n"And you do not wish to marry her?"\r\n\r\n"I did not say that. But do you think that such a girl as Miss\r\nEffingham would marry such a man as I am? She would be much more\r\nlikely to take you. By George, she would! Do you know that she has\r\nthree thousand a year of her own?"\r\n\r\n"I know that she has money."\r\n\r\n"That\'s about the tune of it. I would take her without a shilling\r\nto-morrow, if she would have me,--because I like her. She is the only\r\ngirl I ever did like. But what is the use of my liking her? They have\r\npainted me so black among them, especially my father, that no decent\r\ngirl would think of marrying me."\r\n\r\n"Your father can\'t be angry with you if you do your best to comply\r\nwith his wishes."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care a straw whether he be angry or not. He allows me eight\r\nhundred a year, and he knows that if he stopped it I should go to the\r\nJews the next day. I could not help myself. He can\'t leave an acre\r\naway from me, and yet he won\'t join me in raising money for the sake\r\nof paying Laura her fortune."\r\n\r\n"Lady Laura can hardly want money now."\r\n\r\n"That detestable prig whom she has chosen to marry, and whom I\r\nhate with all my heart, is richer than ever Croesus was; but\r\nnevertheless Laura ought to have her own money. She shall have it\r\nsome day."\r\n\r\n"I would see Lord Brentford, if I were you."\r\n\r\n"I will think about it. Now tell me about coming down to Willingford.\r\nLaura says you will come some day in March. I can mount you for a\r\ncouple of days and should be delighted to have you. My horses all\r\npull like the mischief, and rush like devils, and want a deal of\r\nriding; but an Irishman likes that."\r\n\r\n"I do not dislike it particularly."\r\n\r\n"I like it. I prefer to have something to do on horseback. When\r\na man tells me that a horse is an armchair, I always tell him to\r\nput the brute into his bedroom. Mind you come. The house I stay\r\nat is called the Willingford Bull, and it\'s just four miles from\r\nPeterborough." Phineas swore that he would go down and ride the\r\npulling horses, and then took his leave, earnestly advising Lord\r\nChiltern, as he went, to keep the appointment proposed by his father.\r\n\r\nWhen the morning came, at half-past eleven, the son, who had been\r\nstanding for half an hour with his back to the fire in the large\r\ngloomy dining-room, suddenly rang the bell. "Tell the Earl," he said\r\nto the servant, "that I am here and will go to him if he wishes it."\r\nThe servant came back, and said that the Earl was waiting. Then Lord\r\nChiltern strode after the man into his father\'s room.\r\n\r\n"Oswald," said the father, "I have sent for you because I think it\r\nmay be as well to speak to you on some business. Will you sit down?"\r\nLord Chiltern sat down, but did not answer a word. "I feel very\r\nunhappy about your sister\'s fortune," said the Earl.\r\n\r\n"So do I,--very unhappy. We can raise the money between us, and pay\r\nher to-morrow, if you please it."\r\n\r\n"It was in opposition to my advice that she paid your debts."\r\n\r\n"And in opposition to mine too."\r\n\r\n"I told her that I would not pay them, and were I to give her back\r\nto-morrow, as you say, the money that she has so used, I should be\r\nstultifying myself. But I will do so on one condition. I will join\r\nwith you in raising the money for your sister, on one condition."\r\n\r\n"What is that?"\r\n\r\n"Laura tells me,--indeed she has told me often,--that you are\r\nattached to Violet Effingham."\r\n\r\n"But Violet Effingham, my lord, is unhappily not attached to me."\r\n\r\n"I do not know how that may be. Of course I cannot say. I have never\r\ntaken the liberty of interrogating her upon the subject."\r\n\r\n"Even you, my lord, could hardly have done that."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by that? I say that I never have," said the Earl,\r\nangrily.\r\n\r\n"I simply mean that even you could hardly have asked Miss Effingham\r\nsuch a question. I have asked her, and she has refused me."\r\n\r\n"But girls often do that, and yet accept afterwards the men whom they\r\nhave refused. Laura tells me that she believes that Violet would\r\nconsent if you pressed your suit."\r\n\r\n"Laura knows nothing about it, my lord."\r\n\r\n"There you are probably wrong. Laura and Violet are very close\r\nfriends, and have no doubt discussed this matter between them. At any\r\nrate, it may be as well that you should hear what I have to say. Of\r\ncourse I shall not interfere myself. There is no ground on which I\r\ncan do so with propriety."\r\n\r\n"None whatever," said Lord Chiltern.\r\n\r\nThe Earl became very angry, and nearly broke down in his anger. He\r\npaused for a moment, feeling disposed to tell his son to go and never\r\nto see him again. But he gulped down his wrath, and went on with his\r\nspeech. "My meaning, sir, is this;--that I have so great faith in\r\nViolet Effingham, that I would receive her acceptance of your hand as\r\nthe only proof which would be convincing to me of amendment in your\r\nmode of life. If she were to do so, I would join with you in raising\r\nmoney to pay your sister, would make some further sacrifice with\r\nreference to an income for you and your wife, and--would make you\r\nboth welcome to Saulsby,--if you chose to come." The Earl\'s voice\r\nhesitated much and became almost tremulous as he made the last\r\nproposition. And his eyes had fallen away from his son\'s gaze, and\r\nhe had bent a little over the table, and was moved. But he recovered\r\nhimself at once, and added, with all proper dignity, "If you have\r\nanything to say I shall be glad to hear it."\r\n\r\n"All your offers would be nothing, my lord, if I did not like the\r\ngirl."\r\n\r\n"I should not ask you to marry a girl if you did not like her, as you\r\ncall it."\r\n\r\n"But as to Miss Effingham, it happens that our wishes jump together.\r\nI have asked her, and she has refused me. I don\'t even know where\r\nto find her to ask her again. If I went to Lady Baldock\'s house the\r\nservants would not let me in."\r\n\r\n"And whose fault is that?"\r\n\r\n"Yours partly, my lord. You have told everybody that I am the devil,\r\nand now all the old women believe it."\r\n\r\n"I never told anybody so."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what I\'ll do. I will go down to Lady Baldock\'s to-day.\r\nI suppose she is at Baddingham. And if I can get speech of Miss\r\nEffingham--"\r\n\r\n"Miss Effingham is not at Baddingham. Miss Effingham is staying with\r\nyour sister in Grosvenor Place. I saw her yesterday."\r\n\r\n"She is in London?"\r\n\r\n"I tell you that I saw her yesterday."\r\n\r\n"Very well, my lord. Then I will do the best I can. Laura will tell\r\nyou of the result."\r\n\r\nThe father would have given the son some advice as to the mode in\r\nwhich he should put forward his claim upon Violet\'s hand, but the son\r\nwould not wait to hear it. Choosing to presume that the conference\r\nwas over, he went back to the room in which he had kept his\r\ndumb-bells, and for a minute or two went to work at his favourite\r\nexercise. But he soon put the dumb-bells down, and began to prepare\r\nhimself for his work. If this thing was to be done, it might as\r\nwell be done at once. He looked out of his window, and saw that the\r\nstreets were in a mess of slush. White snow was becoming black mud,\r\nas it will do in London; and the violence of frost was giving way to\r\nthe horrors of thaw. All would be soft and comparatively pleasant in\r\nNorthamptonshire on the following morning, and if everything went\r\nright he would breakfast at the Willingford Bull. He would go down by\r\nthe hunting train, and be at the inn by ten. The meet was only six\r\nmiles distant, and all would be pleasant. He would do this whatever\r\nmight be the result of his work to-day;--but in the meantime he would\r\ngo and do his work. He had a cab called, and within half an hour of\r\nthe time at which he had left his father, he was at the door of his\r\nsister\'s house in Grosvenor Place. The servants told him that the\r\nladies were at lunch. "I can\'t eat lunch," he said. "Tell them that I\r\nam in the drawing-room."\r\n\r\n"He has come to see you," said Lady Laura, as soon as the servant had\r\nleft the room.\r\n\r\n"I hope not," said Violet.\r\n\r\n"Do not say that."\r\n\r\n"But I do say it. I hope he has not come to see me;--that is, not to\r\nsee me specially. Of course I cannot pretend not to know what you\r\nmean."\r\n\r\n"He may think it civil to call if he has heard that you are in town,"\r\nsaid Lady Laura, after a pause.\r\n\r\n"If it be only that, I will be civil in return;--as sweet as May to\r\nhim. If it be really only that, and if I were sure of it, I should\r\nbe really glad to see him." Then they finished their lunch, and Lady\r\nLaura got up and led the way to the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n"I hope you remember," said she, gravely, "that you might be a\r\nsaviour to him."\r\n\r\n"I do not believe in girls being saviours to men. It is the man who\r\nshould be the saviour to the girl. If I marry at all, I have the\r\nright to expect that protection shall be given to me,--not that I\r\nshall have to give it."\r\n\r\n"Violet, you are determined to misrepresent what I mean."\r\n\r\nLord Chiltern was walking about the room, and did not sit down when\r\nthey entered. The ordinary greetings took place, and Miss Effingham\r\nmade some remark about the frost. "But it seems to be going," she\r\nsaid, "and I suppose that you will soon be at work again?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I shall hunt to-morrow," said Lord Chiltern.\r\n\r\n"And the next day, and the next, and the next," said Violet, "till\r\nabout the middle of April;--and then your period of misery will\r\nbegin!"\r\n\r\n"Exactly," said Lord Chiltern. "I have nothing but hunting that I can\r\ncall an occupation."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you make one?" said his sister.\r\n\r\n"I mean to do so, if it be possible. Laura, would you mind leaving me\r\nand Miss Effingham alone for a few minutes?"\r\n\r\nLady Laura got up, and so also did Miss Effingham. "For what\r\npurpose?" said the latter. "It cannot be for any good purpose."\r\n\r\n"At any rate I wish it, and I will not harm you." Lady Laura was now\r\ngoing, but paused before she reached the door. "Laura, will you do as\r\nI ask you?" said the brother. Then Lady Laura went.\r\n\r\n"It was not that I feared you would harm me, Lord Chiltern," said\r\nViolet.\r\n\r\n"No;--I know it was not. But what I say is always said awkwardly. An\r\nhour ago I did not know that you were in town, but when I was told\r\nthe news I came at once. My father told me."\r\n\r\n"I am so glad that you see your father."\r\n\r\n"I have not spoken to him for months before, and probably may not\r\nspeak to him for months again. But there is one point, Violet, on\r\nwhich he and I agree."\r\n\r\n"I hope there will soon be many."\r\n\r\n"It is possible,--but I fear not probable. Look here, Violet,"--and\r\nhe looked at her with all his eyes, till it seemed to her that he was\r\nall eyes, so great was the intensity of his gaze;--"I should scorn\r\nmyself were I to permit myself to come before you with a plea for\r\nyour favour founded on my father\'s whims. My father is unreasonable,\r\nand has been very unjust to me. He has ever believed evil of me, and\r\nhas believed it often when all the world knew that he was wrong. I\r\ncare little for being reconciled to a father who has been so cruel to\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"He loves me dearly, and is my friend. I would rather that you should\r\nnot speak against him to me."\r\n\r\n"You will understand, at least, that I am asking nothing from you\r\nbecause he wishes it. Laura probably has told you that you may make\r\nthings straight by becoming my wife."\r\n\r\n"She has,--certainly, Lord Chiltern."\r\n\r\n"It is an argument that she should never have used. It is an argument\r\nto which you should not listen for a moment. Make things straight\r\nindeed! Who can tell? There would be very little made straight by\r\nsuch a marriage, if it were not that I loved you. Violet, that is\r\nmy plea, and my only one. I love you so well that I do believe that\r\nif you took me I should return to the old ways, and become as other\r\nmen are, and be in time as respectable, as stupid,--and perhaps as\r\nill-natured as old Lady Baldock herself."\r\n\r\n"My poor aunt!"\r\n\r\n"You know she says worse things of me than that. Now, dearest, you\r\nhave heard all that I have to say to you." As he spoke he came close\r\nto her, and put out his hand,--but she did not touch it. "I have no\r\nother argument to use,--not a word more to say. As I came here in\r\nthe cab I was turning it over in my mind that I might find what best\r\nI should say. But, after all, there is nothing more to be said than\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"The words make no difference," she replied.\r\n\r\n"Not unless they be so uttered as to force a belief. I do love you. I\r\nknow no other reason but that why you should be my wife. I have no\r\nother excuse to offer for coming to you again. You are the one thing\r\nin the world that to me has any charm. Can you be surprised that I\r\nshould be persistent in asking for it?" He was looking at her still\r\nwith the same gaze, and there seemed to be a power in his eye from\r\nwhich she could not escape. He was still standing with his right hand\r\nout, as though expecting, or at least hoping, that her hand might be\r\nput into his.\r\n\r\n"How am I to answer you?" she said.\r\n\r\n"With your love, if you can give it to me. Do you remember how you\r\nswore once that you would love me for ever and always?"\r\n\r\n"You should not remind me of that. I was a child then,--a naughty\r\nchild," she added, smiling; "and was put to bed for what I did on\r\nthat day."\r\n\r\n"Be a child still."\r\n\r\n"Ah, if we but could!"\r\n\r\n"And have you no other answer to make me?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I must answer you. You are entitled to an answer. Lord\r\nChiltern, I am sorry that I cannot give you the love for which you\r\nask."\r\n\r\n"Never?"\r\n\r\n"Never."\r\n\r\n"Is it myself personally, or what you have heard of me, that is so\r\nhateful to you?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing is hateful to me. I have never spoken of hate. I shall\r\nalways feel the strongest regard for my old friend and playfellow.\r\nBut there are many things which a woman is bound to consider before\r\nshe allows herself so to love a man that she can consent to become\r\nhis wife."\r\n\r\n"Allow herself! Then it is a matter entirely of calculation."\r\n\r\n"I suppose there should be some thought in it, Lord Chiltern."\r\n\r\nThere was now a pause, and the man\'s hand was at last allowed to\r\ndrop, as there came no response to the proffered grasp. He walked\r\nonce or twice across the room before he spoke again, and then he\r\nstopped himself closely opposite to her.\r\n\r\n"I shall never try again," he said.\r\n\r\n"It will be better so," she replied.\r\n\r\n"There is something to me unmanly in a man\'s persecuting a girl. Just\r\ntell Laura, will you, that it is all over; and she may as well tell\r\nmy father. Good-bye."\r\n\r\nShe then tendered her hand to him, but he did not take it,--probably\r\ndid not see it, and at once left the room and the house.\r\n\r\n"And yet I believe you love him," Lady Laura said to her friend\r\nin her anger, when they discussed the matter immediately on Lord\r\nChiltern\'s departure.\r\n\r\n"You have no right to say that, Laura."\r\n\r\n"I have a right to my belief, and I do believe it. I think you love\r\nhim, and that you lack the courage to risk yourself in trying to save\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Is a woman bound to marry a man if she love him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, she is," replied Lady Laura impetuously, without thinking of\r\nwhat she was saying; "that is, if she be convinced that she also is\r\nloved."\r\n\r\n"Whatever be the man\'s character;--whatever be the circumstances?\r\nMust she do so, whatever friends may say to the contrary? Is there to\r\nbe no prudence in marriage?"\r\n\r\n"There may be a great deal too much prudence," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"That is true. There is certainly too much prudence if a woman\r\nmarries prudently, but without love." Violet intended by this no\r\nattack upon her friend,--had not had present in her mind at the\r\nmoment any idea of Lady Laura\'s special prudence in marrying Mr.\r\nKennedy; but Lady Laura felt it keenly, and knew at once that an\r\narrow had been shot which had wounded her.\r\n\r\n"We shall get nothing," she said, "by descending to personalities\r\nwith each other."\r\n\r\n"I meant none, Laura."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it is always hard," said Lady Laura, "for any one person\r\nto judge altogether of the mind of another. If I have said anything\r\nsevere of your refusal of my brother, I retract it. I only wish that\r\nit could have been otherwise."\r\n\r\nLord Chiltern, when he left his sister\'s house, walked through the\r\nslush and dirt to a haunt of his in the neighbourhood of Covent\r\nGarden, and there he remained through the whole afternoon and\r\nevening. A certain Captain Clutterbuck joined him, and dined with\r\nhim. He told nothing to Captain Clutterbuck of his sorrow, but\r\nCaptain Clutterbuck could see that he was unhappy.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s have another bottle of \'cham,\'" said Captain Clutterbuck, when\r\ntheir dinner was nearly over. "\'Cham\' is the only thing to screw one\r\nup when one is down a peg."\r\n\r\n"You can have what you like," said Lord Chiltern; "but I shall have\r\nsome brandy-and-water."\r\n\r\n"The worst of brandy-and-water is, that one gets tired of it before\r\nthe night is over," said Captain Clutterbuck.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Lord Chiltern did go down to Peterborough the next day\r\nby the hunting train, and rode his horse Bonebreaker so well in that\r\nfamous run from Sutton springs to Gidding that after the run young\r\nPiles,--of the house of Piles, Sarsnet, and Gingham,--offered him\r\nthree hundred pounds for the animal.\r\n\r\n"He isn\'t worth above fifty," said Lord Chiltern.\r\n\r\n"But I\'ll give you the three hundred," said Piles.\r\n\r\n"You couldn\'t ride him if you\'d got him," said Lord Chiltern.\r\n\r\n"Oh, couldn\'t I!" said Piles. But Mr. Piles did not continue the\r\nconversation, contenting himself with telling his friend Grogram that\r\nthat red devil Chiltern was as drunk as a lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nThe Debate on the Ballot\r\n\r\n\r\nPhineas took his seat in the House with a consciousness of much\r\ninward trepidation of heart on that night of the ballot debate. After\r\nleaving Lord Chiltern he went down to his club and dined alone. Three\r\nor four men came and spoke to him; but he could not talk to them at\r\nhis ease, nor did he quite know what they were saying to him. He\r\nwas going to do something which he longed to achieve, but the very\r\nidea of which, now that it was so near to him, was a terror to him.\r\nTo be in the House and not to speak would, to his thinking, be a\r\ndisgraceful failure. Indeed, he could not continue to keep his seat\r\nunless he spoke. He had been put there that he might speak. He would\r\nspeak. Of course he would speak. Had he not already been conspicuous\r\nalmost as a boy orator? And yet, at this moment he did not know\r\nwhether he was eating mutton or beef, or who was standing opposite to\r\nhim and talking to him, so much was he in dread of the ordeal which\r\nhe had prepared for himself. As he went down to the House after\r\ndinner, he almost made up his mind that it would be a good thing to\r\nleave London by one of the night mail trains. He felt himself to be\r\nstiff and stilted as he walked, and that his clothes were uneasy to\r\nhim. When he turned into Westminster Hall he regretted more keenly\r\nthan ever he had done that he had seceded from the keeping of Mr.\r\nLow. He could, he thought, have spoken very well in court, and would\r\nthere have learned that self-confidence which now failed him so\r\nterribly. It was, however, too late to think of that. He could only\r\ngo in and take his seat.\r\n\r\nHe went in and took his seat, and the chamber seemed to him to be\r\nmysteriously large, as though benches were crowded over benches, and\r\ngalleries over galleries. He had been long enough in the House to\r\nhave lost the original awe inspired by the Speaker and the clerks of\r\nthe House, by the row of Ministers, and by the unequalled importance\r\nof the place. On ordinary occasions he could saunter in and out, and\r\nwhisper at his ease to a neighbour. But on this occasion he went\r\ndirect to the bench on which he ordinarily sat, and began at once to\r\nrehearse to himself his speech. He had in truth been doing this all\r\nday, in spite of the effort that he had made to rid himself of all\r\nmemory of the occasion. He had been collecting the heads of his\r\nspeech while Mr. Low had been talking to him, and refreshing his\r\nquotations in the presence of Lord Chiltern and the dumb-bells. He\r\nhad taxed his memory and his intellect with various tasks, which,\r\nas he feared, would not adjust themselves one with another. He had\r\nlearned the headings of his speech,--so that one heading might follow\r\nthe other, and nothing be forgotten. And he had learned verbatim the\r\nwords which he intended to utter under each heading,--with a hope\r\nthat if any one compact part should be destroyed or injured in its\r\ncompactness by treachery of memory, or by the course of the debate,\r\neach other compact part might be there in its entirety, ready for\r\nuse;--or at least so many of the compact parts as treachery of\r\nmemory and the accidents of the debate might leave to him; so\r\nthat his speech might be like a vessel, watertight in its various\r\ncompartments, that would float by the buoyancy of its stern and bow,\r\neven though the hold should be waterlogged. But this use of his\r\ncomposed words, even though he should be able to carry it through,\r\nwould not complete his work;--for it would be his duty to answer in\r\nsome sort those who had gone before him, and in order to do this he\r\nmust be able to insert, without any prearrangement of words or ideas,\r\nlittle intercalatory parts between those compact masses of argument\r\nwith which he had been occupying himself for many laborious hours. As\r\nhe looked round upon the House and perceived that everything was dim\r\nbefore him, that all his original awe of the House had returned, and\r\nwith it a present quaking fear that made him feel the pulsations\r\nof his own heart, he became painfully aware that the task he had\r\nprepared for himself was too great. He should, on this the occasion\r\nof his rising to his maiden legs, have either prepared for himself\r\na short general speech, which could indeed have done little for his\r\ncredit in the House, but which might have served to carry off the\r\nnovelty of the thing, and have introduced him to the sound of his own\r\nvoice within those walls,--or he should have trusted to what his wit\r\nand spirit would produce for him on the spur of the moment, and not\r\nhave burdened himself with a huge exercise of memory. During the\r\npresentation of a few petitions he tried to repeat to himself the\r\nfirst of his compact parts,--a compact part on which, as it might\r\ncertainly be brought into use let the debate have gone as it might,\r\nhe had expended great care. He had flattered himself that there\r\nwas something of real strength in his words as he repeated them to\r\nhimself in the comfortable seclusion of his own room, and he had made\r\nthem so ready to his tongue that he thought it to be impossible that\r\nhe should forget even an intonation. Now he found that he could not\r\nremember the first phrases without unloosing and looking at a small\r\nroll of paper which he held furtively in his hand. What was the good\r\nof looking at it? He would forget it again in the next moment. He had\r\nintended to satisfy the most eager of his friends, and to astound his\r\nopponents. As it was, no one would be satisfied,--and none astounded\r\nbut they who had trusted in him.\r\n\r\nThe debate began, and if the leisure afforded by a long and tedious\r\nspeech could have served him, he might have had leisure enough. He\r\ntried at first to follow all that this advocate for the ballot might\r\nsay, hoping thence to acquire the impetus of strong interest; but he\r\nsoon wearied of the work, and began to long that the speech might\r\nbe ended, although the period of his own martyrdom would thereby\r\nbe brought nearer to him. At half-past seven so many members had\r\ndeserted their seats, that Phineas began to think that he might be\r\nsaved all further pains by a "count out." He reckoned the members\r\npresent and found that they were below the mystic forty,--first by\r\ntwo, then by four, by five, by seven, and at one time by eleven.\r\nIt was not for him to ask the Speaker to count the House, but he\r\nwondered that no one else should do so. And yet, as the idea of this\r\ntermination to the night\'s work came upon him, and as he thought of\r\nhis lost labour, he almost took courage again,--almost dreaded rather\r\nthan wished for the interference of some malicious member. But there\r\nwas no malicious member then present, or else it was known that Lords\r\nof the Treasury and Lords of the Admiralty would flock in during\r\nthe Speaker\'s ponderous counting,--and thus the slow length of the\r\nballot-lover\'s verbosity was permitted to evolve itself without\r\ninterruption. At eight o\'clock he had completed his catalogue of\r\nillustrations, and immediately Mr. Monk rose from the Treasury bench\r\nto explain the grounds on which the Government must decline to\r\nsupport the motion before the House.\r\n\r\nPhineas was aware that Mr. Monk intended to speak, and was aware also\r\nthat his speech would be very short. "My idea is," he had said to\r\nPhineas, "that every man possessed of the franchise should dare to\r\nhave and to express a political opinion of his own; that otherwise\r\nthe franchise is not worth having; and that men will learn that when\r\nall so dare, no evil can come from such daring. As the ballot would\r\nmake any courage of that kind unnecessary, I dislike the ballot. I\r\nshall confine myself to that, and leave the illustration to younger\r\ndebaters." Phineas also had been informed that Mr. Turnbull would\r\nreply to Mr. Monk, with the purpose of crushing Mr. Monk into dust,\r\nand Phineas had prepared his speech with something of an intention of\r\nsubsequently crushing Mr. Turnbull. He knew, however, that he could\r\nnot command his opportunity. There was the chapter of accidents to\r\nwhich he must accommodate himself; but such had been his programme\r\nfor the evening.\r\n\r\nMr. Monk made his speech,--and though he was short, he was very fiery\r\nand energetic. Quick as lightning words of wrath and scorn flew from\r\nhim, in which he painted the cowardice, the meanness, the falsehood\r\nof the ballot. "The ballot-box," he said, "was the grave of all true\r\npolitical opinion." Though he spoke hardly for ten minutes, he seemed\r\nto say more than enough, ten times enough, to slaughter the argument\r\nof the former speaker. At every hot word as it fell Phineas was\r\ndriven to regret that a paragraph of his own was taken away from him,\r\nand that his choicest morsels of standing ground were being cut from\r\nunder his feet. When Mr. Monk sat down, Phineas felt that Mr. Monk\r\nhad said all that he, Phineas Finn, had intended to say.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Turnbull rose slowly from the bench below the gangway. With\r\na speaker so frequent and so famous as Mr. Turnbull no hurry is\r\nnecessary. He is sure to have his opportunity. The Speaker\'s eye is\r\never travelling to the accustomed spots. Mr. Turnbull rose slowly and\r\nbegan his oration very mildly. "There was nothing," he said, "that he\r\nadmired so much as the poetic imagery and the high-flown sentiment\r\nof his right honourable friend the member for West Bromwich,"--Mr.\r\nMonk sat for West Bromwich,--"unless it were the stubborn facts and\r\nunanswered arguments of his honourable friend who had brought forward\r\nthis motion." Then Mr. Turnbull proceeded after his fashion to crush\r\nMr. Monk. He was very prosaic, very clear both in voice and language,\r\nvery harsh, and very unscrupulous. He and Mr. Monk had been joined\r\ntogether in politics for over twenty years;--but one would have\r\nthought, from Mr. Turnbull\'s words, that they had been the bitterest\r\nof enemies. Mr. Monk was taunted with his office, taunted with his\r\ndesertion of the liberal party, taunted with his ambition,--and\r\ntaunted with his lack of ambition. "I once thought," said Mr.\r\nTurnbull,--"nay, not long ago I thought, that he and I would have\r\nfought this battle for the people, shoulder to shoulder, and knee to\r\nknee;--but he has preferred that the knee next to his own shall wear\r\na garter, and that the shoulder which supports him shall be decked\r\nwith a blue ribbon,--as shoulders, I presume, are decked in those\r\ncloset conferences which are called Cabinets."\r\n\r\nJust after this, while Mr. Turnbull was still going on with a variety\r\nof illustrations drawn from the United States, Barrington Erle\r\nstepped across the benches up to the place where Phineas was sitting,\r\nand whispered a few words into his ear. "Bonteen is prepared to\r\nanswer Turnbull, and wishes to do it. I told him that I thought you\r\nshould have the opportunity, if you wish it." Phineas was not ready\r\nwith a reply to Erle at the spur of the moment. "Somebody told\r\nme," continued Erle, "that you had said that you would like to speak\r\nto-night."\r\n\r\n"So I did," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Shall I tell Bonteen that you will do it?"\r\n\r\nThe chamber seemed to swim round before our hero\'s eyes. Mr. Turnbull\r\nwas still going on with his clear, loud, unpleasant voice, but there\r\nwas no knowing how long he might go on. Upon Phineas, if he should\r\nnow consent, might devolve the duty, within ten minutes, within three\r\nminutes, of rising there before a full House to defend his great\r\nfriend, Mr. Monk, from a gross personal attack. Was it fit that\r\nsuch a novice as he should undertake such a work as that? Were he\r\nto do so, all that speech which he had prepared, with its various\r\nself-floating parts, must go for nothing. The task was exactly that\r\nwhich, of all tasks, he would best like to have accomplished, and\r\nto have accomplished well. But if he should fail! And he felt that\r\nhe would fail. For such work a man should have all his senses\r\nabout him,--his full courage, perfect confidence, something almost\r\napproaching to contempt for listening opponents, and nothing of fear\r\nin regard to listening friends. He should be as a cock in his own\r\nfarmyard, master of all the circumstances around him. But Phineas\r\nFinn had not even as yet heard the sound of his own voice in that\r\nroom. At this moment, so confused was he, that he did not know where\r\nsat Mr. Mildmay, and where Mr. Daubeny. All was confused, and there\r\narose as it were a sound of waters in his ears, and a feeling as of a\r\ngreat hell around him. "I had rather wait," he said at last. "Bonteen\r\nhad better reply." Barrington Erle looked into his face, and then\r\nstepping back across the benches, told Mr. Bonteen that the\r\nopportunity was his.\r\n\r\nMr. Turnbull continued speaking quite long enough to give poor\r\nPhineas time for repentance; but repentance was of no use. He had\r\ndecided against himself, and his decision could not be reversed. He\r\nwould have left the House, only it seemed to him that had he done so\r\nevery one would look at him. He drew his hat down over his eyes, and\r\nremained in his place, hating Mr. Bonteen, hating Barrington Erle,\r\nhating Mr. Turnbull,--but hating no one so much as he hated himself.\r\nHe had disgraced himself for ever and could never recover the\r\noccasion which he had lost.\r\n\r\nMr. Bonteen\'s speech was in no way remarkable. Mr. Monk, he said, had\r\ndone the State good service by adding his wisdom and patriotism to\r\nthe Cabinet. The sort of argument which Mr. Bonteen used to prove\r\nthat a man who has gained credit as a legislator should in process of\r\ntime become a member of the executive, is trite and common, and was\r\nnot used by Mr. Bonteen with any special force. Mr. Bonteen was glib\r\nof tongue and possessed that familiarity with the place which poor\r\nPhineas had lacked so sorely. There was one moment, however, which\r\nwas terrible to Phineas. As soon as Mr. Bonteen had shown the purpose\r\nfor which he was on his legs, Mr. Monk looked round at Phineas, as\r\nthough in reproach. He had expected that this work should fall into\r\nthe hands of one who would perform it with more warmth of heart than\r\ncould be expected from Mr. Bonteen. When Mr. Bonteen ceased, two or\r\nthree other short speeches were made and members fired off their\r\nlittle guns. Phineas having lost so great an opportunity, would not\r\nnow consent to accept one that should be comparatively valueless.\r\nThen there came a division. The motion was lost by a large\r\nmajority,--by any number you might choose to name, as Phineas had\r\nsaid to Lord Brentford; but in that there was no triumph to the poor\r\nwretch who had failed through fear, and who was now a coward in his\r\nown esteem.\r\n\r\nHe left the House alone, carefully avoiding all speech with any one.\r\nAs he came out he had seen Laurence Fitzgibbon in the lobby, but he\r\nhad gone on without pausing a moment, so that he might avoid his\r\nfriend. And when he was out in Palace Yard, where was he to go next?\r\nHe looked at his watch, and found that it was just ten. He did not\r\ndare to go to his club, and it was impossible for him to go home and\r\nto bed. He was very miserable, and nothing would comfort him but\r\nsympathy. Was there any one who would listen to his abuse of himself,\r\nand would then answer him with kindly apologies for his own weakness?\r\nMrs. Bunce would do it if she knew how, but sympathy from Mrs. Bunce\r\nwould hardly avail. There was but one person in the world to whom he\r\ncould tell his own humiliation with any hope of comfort, and that\r\nperson was Lady Laura Kennedy. Sympathy from any man would have been\r\ndistasteful to him. He had thought for a moment of flinging himself\r\nat Mr. Monk\'s feet and telling all his weakness;--but he could not\r\nhave endured pity even from Mr. Monk. It was not to be endured from\r\nany man.\r\n\r\nHe thought that Lady Laura Kennedy would be at home, and probably\r\nalone. He knew, at any rate, that he might be allowed to knock at her\r\ndoor, even at that hour. He had left Mr. Kennedy in the House, and\r\nthere he would probably remain for the next hour. There was no man\r\nmore constant than Mr. Kennedy in seeing the work of the day,--or of\r\nthe night,--to its end. So Phineas walked up Victoria Street, and\r\nfrom thence into Grosvenor Place, and knocked at Lady Laura\'s door.\r\n"Yes; Lady Laura was at home; and alone." He was shown up into the\r\ndrawing-room, and there he found Lady Laura waiting for her husband.\r\n\r\n"So the great debate is over," she said, with as much of irony as she\r\nknew how to throw into the epithet.\r\n\r\n"Yes; it is over."\r\n\r\n"And what have they done,--those leviathans of the people?"\r\n\r\nThen Phineas told her what was the majority.\r\n\r\n"Is there anything the matter with you, Mr. Finn?" she said, looking\r\nat him suddenly. "Are you not well?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I am very well."\r\n\r\n"Will you not sit down? There is something wrong, I know. What is\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"I have simply been the greatest idiot, the greatest coward, the most\r\nawkward ass that ever lived!"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know why I should come to tell you of it at this hour at\r\nnight, but I have come that I might tell you. Probably because there\r\nis no one else in the whole world who would not laugh at me."\r\n\r\n"At any rate, I shall not laugh at you," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"But you will despise me."\r\n\r\n"That I am sure I shall not do."\r\n\r\n"You cannot help it. I despise myself. For years I have placed before\r\nmyself the ambition of speaking in the House of Commons;--for years I\r\nhave been thinking whether there would ever come to me an opportunity\r\nof making myself heard in that assembly, which I consider to be\r\nthe first in the world. To-day the opportunity has been offered to\r\nme,--and, though the motion was nothing, the opportunity was great.\r\nThe subject was one on which I was thoroughly prepared. The manner\r\nin which I was summoned was most flattering to me. I was especially\r\ncalled on to perform a task which was most congenial to my\r\nfeelings;--and I declined because I was afraid."\r\n\r\n"You had thought too much about it, my friend," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"Too much or too little, what does it matter?" replied Phineas, in\r\ndespair. "There is the fact. I could not do it. Do you remember the\r\nstory of Conachar in the \'Fair Maid of Perth;\'--how his heart refused\r\nto give him blood enough to fight? He had been suckled with the milk\r\nof a timid creature, and, though he could die, there was none of the\r\nstrength of manhood in him. It is about the same thing with me, I\r\ntake it."\r\n\r\n"I do not think you are at all like Conachar," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"I am equally disgraced, and I must perish after the same fashion. I\r\nshall apply for the Chiltern Hundreds in a day or two."\r\n\r\n"You will do nothing of the kind," said Lady Laura, getting up from\r\nher chair and coming towards him. "You shall not leave this room till\r\nyou have promised me that you will do nothing of the kind. I do not\r\nknow as yet what has occurred to-night; but I do know that that\r\nmodesty which has kept you silent is more often a grace than a\r\ndisgrace."\r\n\r\nThis was the kind of sympathy which he wanted, She drew her chair\r\nnearer to him, and then he explained to her as accurately as he could\r\nwhat had taken place in the House on this evening,--how he had\r\nprepared his speech, how he had felt that his preparation was vain,\r\nhow he perceived from the course of the debate that if he spoke\r\nat all his speech must be very different from what he had first\r\nintended; how he had declined to take upon himself a task which\r\nseemed to require so close a knowledge of the ways of the House and\r\nof the temper of the men, as the defence of such a man as Mr. Monk.\r\nIn accusing himself he, unconsciously, excused himself, and his\r\nexcuse, in Lady Laura\'s ears, was more valid than his accusation.\r\n\r\n"And you would give it all up for that?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I think I ought."\r\n\r\n"I have very little doubt but that you were right in allowing Mr.\r\nBonteen to undertake such a task. I should simply explain to Mr. Monk\r\nthat you felt too keen an interest in his welfare to stand up as an\r\nuntried member in his defence. It is not, I think, the work for a man\r\nwho is not at home in the House. I am sure Mr. Monk will feel this,\r\nand I am quite certain that Mr. Kennedy will think that you have been\r\nright."\r\n\r\n"I do not care what Mr. Kennedy may think."\r\n\r\n"Why do you say that, Mr. Finn? That is not courteous."\r\n\r\n"Simply because I care so much what Mr. Kennedy\'s wife may think.\r\nYour opinion is all in all to me,--only that I know you are too kind\r\nto me."\r\n\r\n"He would not be too kind to you. He is never too kind to any one. He\r\nis justice itself."\r\n\r\nPhineas, as he heard the tones of her voice, could not but feel that\r\nthere was in Lady Laura\'s words something of an accusation against\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\n"I hate justice," said Phineas. "I know that justice would condemn\r\nme. But love and friendship know nothing of justice. The value of\r\nlove is that it overlooks faults, and forgives even crimes."\r\n\r\n"I, at any rate," said Lady Laura, "will forgive the crime of your\r\nsilence in the House. My strong belief in your success will not be in\r\nthe least affected by what you tell me of your failure to-night. You\r\nmust await another opportunity; and, if possible, you should be less\r\nanxious as to your own performance. There is Violet." As Lady Laura\r\nspoke the last words, there was a sound of a carriage stopping in the\r\nstreet, and the front door was immediately opened. "She is staying\r\nhere, but has been dining with her uncle, Admiral Effingham." Then\r\nViolet Effingham entered the room, rolled up in pretty white furs,\r\nand silk cloaks, and lace shawls. "Here is Mr. Finn, come to tell us\r\nof the debate about the ballot."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care twopence about the ballot," said Violet, as she put out\r\nher hand to Phineas. "Are we going to have a new iron fleet built?\r\nThat\'s the question."\r\n\r\n"Sir Simeon has come out strong to-night," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"There is no political question of any importance except the question\r\nof the iron fleet," said Violet. "I am quite sure of that, and so, if\r\nMr. Finn can tell me nothing about the iron fleet, I\'ll go to bed."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Kennedy will tell you everything when he comes home," said\r\nPhineas.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Kennedy! Mr. Kennedy never tells one anything. I doubt\r\nwhether Mr. Kennedy thinks that any woman knows the meaning of the\r\nBritish Constitution."\r\n\r\n"Do you know what it means, Violet?" asked Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"To be sure I do. It is liberty to growl about the iron fleet, or\r\nthe ballot, or the taxes, or the peers, or the bishops,--or anything\r\nelse, except the House of Commons. That\'s the British Constitution.\r\nGood-night, Mr. Finn."\r\n\r\n"What a beautiful creature she is!" said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"And full of wit and grace and pleasantness. I do not wonder at your\r\nbrother\'s choice."\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that this was said on the day before Lord\r\nChiltern had made his offer for the third time.\r\n\r\n"Poor Oswald! he does not know as yet that she is in town."\r\n\r\nAfter that Phineas went, not wishing to await the return of Mr.\r\nKennedy. He had felt that Violet Effingham had come into the room\r\njust in time to remedy a great difficulty. He did not wish to speak\r\nof his love to a married woman,--to the wife of the man who called\r\nhim friend,--to a woman who he felt sure would have rebuked him. But\r\nhe could hardly have restrained himself had not Miss Effingham been\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nBut as he went home he thought more of Miss Effingham than he did of\r\nLady Laura; and I think that the voice of Miss Effingham had done\r\nalmost as much towards comforting him as had the kindness of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, he had been comforted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n"Do be punctual"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the very morning after his failure in the House of Commons, when\r\nPhineas was reading in the _Telegraph_,--he took the _Telegraph_ not\r\nfrom choice but for economy,--the words of that debate which he had\r\nheard and in which he should have taken a part, a most unwelcome\r\nvisit was paid to him. It was near eleven, and the breakfast things\r\nwere still on the table. He was at this time on a Committee of the\r\nHouse with reference to the use of potted peas in the army and\r\nnavy, at which he had sat once,--at a preliminary meeting,--and in\r\nreference to which he had already resolved that as he had failed so\r\nfrightfully in debate, he would certainly do his duty to the utmost\r\nin the more easy but infinitely more tedious work of the Committee\r\nRoom. The Committee met at twelve, and he intended to walk down to\r\nthe Reform Club, and then to the House. He had just completed his\r\nreading of the debate and of the leaders in the _Telegraph_ on the\r\nsubject. He had told himself how little the writer of the article\r\nknew about Mr. Turnbull, how little about Mr. Monk, and how little\r\nabout the people,--such being his own ideas as to the qualifications\r\nof the writer of that leading article,--and was about to start. But\r\nMrs. Bunce arrested him by telling him that there was a man below who\r\nwanted to see him.\r\n\r\n"What sort of a man, Mrs. Bunce?"\r\n\r\n"He ain\'t a gentleman, sir."\r\n\r\n"Did he give his name?"\r\n\r\n"He did not, sir; but I know it\'s about money. I know the ways of\r\nthem so well. I\'ve seen this one\'s face before somewhere."\r\n\r\n"You had better show him up," said Phineas. He knew well the business\r\non which the man was come. The man wanted money for that bill which\r\nLaurence Fitzgibbon had sent afloat, and which Phineas had endorsed.\r\nPhineas had never as yet fallen so deeply into troubles of money as\r\nto make it necessary that he need refuse himself to any callers on\r\nthat score, and he did not choose to do so now. Nevertheless he most\r\nheartily wished that he had left his lodgings for the club before the\r\nman had come. This was not the first he had heard of the bill being\r\noverdue and unpaid. The bill had been brought to him noted a month\r\nsince, and then he had simply told the youth who brought it that he\r\nwould see Mr. Fitzgibbon and have the matter settled. He had spoken\r\nto his friend Laurence, and Laurence had simply assured him that all\r\nshould be made right in two days,--or, at furthest, by the end of\r\na week. Since that time he had observed that his friend had been\r\nsomewhat shy of speaking to him when no others were with them.\r\nPhineas would not have alluded to the bill had he and Laurence been\r\nalone together; but he had been quick enough to guess from his\r\nfriend\'s manner that the matter was not settled. Now, no doubt,\r\nserious trouble was about to commence.\r\n\r\nThe visitor was a little man with grey hair and a white cravat, some\r\nsixty years of age, dressed in black, with a very decent hat,--which,\r\non entering the room, he at once put down on the nearest chair,--with\r\nreference to whom, any judge on the subject would have concurred at\r\nfirst sight in the decision pronounced by Mrs. Bunce, though none\r\nbut a judge very well used to sift the causes of his own conclusions\r\ncould have given the reasons for that early decision. "He ain\'t a\r\ngentleman," Mrs. Bunce had said. And the man certainly was not a\r\ngentleman. The old man in the white cravat was very neatly dressed,\r\nand carried himself without any of that humility which betrays one\r\nclass of uncertified aspirants to gentility, or of that assumed\r\narrogance which is at once fatal to another class. But, nevertheless,\r\nMrs. Bunce had seen at a glance that he was not a gentleman,--had\r\nseen, moreover, that such a man could have come only upon one\r\nmission. She was right there too. This visitor had come about money.\r\n\r\n"About this bill, Mr. Finn," said the visitor, proceeding to take\r\nout of his breast coat-pocket a rather large leathern case, as he\r\nadvanced up towards the fire. "My name is Clarkson, Mr. Finn. If I\r\nmay venture so far, I\'ll take a chair."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, Mr. Clarkson," said Phineas, getting up and pointing to\r\na seat.\r\n\r\n"Thankye, Mr. Finn, thankye. We shall be more comfortable doing\r\nbusiness sitting, shan\'t we?" Whereupon the horrid little man drew\r\nhimself close in to the fire, and spreading out his leathern case\r\nupon his knees, began to turn over one suspicious bit of paper after\r\nanother, as though he were uncertain in what part of his portfolio\r\nlay this identical bit which he was seeking. He seemed to be quite\r\nat home, and to feel that there was no ground whatever for hurry\r\nin such comfortable quarters. Phineas hated him at once,--with a\r\nhatred altogether unconnected with the difficulty which his friend\r\nFitzgibbon had brought upon him.\r\n\r\n"Here it is," said Mr. Clarkson at last. "Oh, dear me, dear me! the\r\nthird of November, and here we are in March! I didn\'t think it was\r\nso bad as this;--I didn\'t indeed. This is very bad,--very bad! And\r\nfor Parliament gents, too, who should be more punctual than anybody,\r\nbecause of the privilege. Shouldn\'t they now, Mr. Finn?"\r\n\r\n"All men should be punctual, I suppose," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Of course they should; of course they should. I always say to my\r\ngents, \'Be punctual, and I\'ll do anything for you.\' But, perhaps, Mr.\r\nFinn, you can hand me a cheque for this amount, and then you and I\r\nwill begin square."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I cannot, Mr. Clarkson."\r\n\r\n"Not hand me a cheque for it!"\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, no."\r\n\r\n"That\'s very bad;--very bad indeed. Then I suppose I must take the\r\nhalf, and renew for the remainder, though I don\'t like it;--I don\'t\r\nindeed."\r\n\r\n"I can pay no part of that bill, Mr. Clarkson."\r\n\r\n"Pay no part of it!" and Mr. Clarkson, in order that he might the\r\nbetter express his surprise, arrested his hand in the very act of\r\npoking his host\'s fire.\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll allow me, I\'ll manage the fire," said Phineas, putting out\r\nhis hand for the poker.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Clarkson was fond of poking fires, and would not surrender\r\nthe poker. "Pay no part of it!" he said again, holding the poker away\r\nfrom Phineas in his left hand. "Don\'t say that, Mr. Finn. Pray don\'t\r\nsay that. Don\'t drive me to be severe. I don\'t like to be severe with\r\nmy gents. I\'ll do anything, Mr. Finn, if you\'ll only be punctual."\r\n\r\n"The fact is, Mr. Clarkson, I have never had one penny of\r\nconsideration for that bill, and--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Finn! oh, Mr. Finn!" and then Mr. Clarkson had his will of\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n"I never had one penny of consideration for that bill," continued\r\nPhineas. "Of course, I don\'t deny my responsibility."\r\n\r\n"No, Mr. Finn; you can\'t deny that. Here it is;--Phineas Finn;--and\r\neverybody knows you, because you\'re a Parliament gent."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t deny it. But I had no reason to suppose that I should\r\nbe called upon for the money when I accommodated my friend, Mr.\r\nFitzgibbon, and I have not got it. That is the long and the short\r\nof it. I must see him and take care that arrangements are made."\r\n\r\n"Arrangements!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, arrangements for settling the bill."\r\n\r\n"He hasn\'t got the money, Mr. Finn. You know that as well as I do."\r\n\r\n"I know nothing about it, Mr. Clarkson."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, Mr. Finn; you know; you know."\r\n\r\n"I tell you I know nothing about it," said Phineas, waxing angry.\r\n\r\n"As to Mr. Fitzgibbon, he\'s the pleasantest gent that ever lived.\r\nIsn\'t he now? I\'ve know\'d him these ten years. I don\'t suppose that\r\nfor ten years I\'ve been without his name in my pocket. But, bless\r\nyou, Mr. Finn, there\'s an end to everything. I shouldn\'t have looked\r\nat this bit of paper if it hadn\'t been for your signature. Of course\r\nnot. You\'re just beginning, and it\'s natural you should want a little\r\nhelp. You\'ll find me always ready, if you\'ll only be punctual."\r\n\r\n"I tell you again, sir, that I never had a shilling out of that for\r\nmyself, and do not want any such help." Here Mr. Clarkson smiled\r\nsweetly. "I gave my name to my friend simply to oblige him."\r\n\r\n"I like you Irish gents because you do hang together so close," said\r\nMr. Clarkson.\r\n\r\n"Simply to oblige him," continued Phineas. "As I said before, I know\r\nthat I am responsible; but, as I said before also, I have not the\r\nmeans of taking up that bill. I will see Mr. Fitzgibbon, and let\r\nyou know what we propose to do." Then Phineas got up from his seat\r\nand took his hat. It was full time that he should go down to his\r\nCommittee. But Mr. Clarkson did not get up from his seat. "I\'m afraid\r\nI must ask you to leave me now, Mr. Clarkson, as I have business down\r\nat the House."\r\n\r\n"Business at the House never presses, Mr. Finn," said Mr. Clarkson.\r\n"That\'s the best of Parliament. I\'ve known Parliament gents this\r\nthirty years and more. Would you believe it--I\'ve had a Prime\r\nMinister\'s name in that portfolio; that I have; and a Lord\r\nChancellor\'s; that I have;--and an Archbishop\'s too. I know\r\nwhat Parliament is, Mr. Finn. Come, come; don\'t put me off with\r\nParliament."\r\n\r\nThere he sat before the fire with his pouch open before him, and\r\nPhineas had no power of moving him. Could Phineas have paid him the\r\nmoney which was manifestly due to him on the bill, the man would of\r\ncourse have gone; but failing in that, Phineas could not turn him\r\nout. There was a black cloud on the young member\'s brow, and great\r\nanger at his heart,--against Fitzgibbon rather than against the man\r\nwho was sitting there before him. "Sir," he said, "it is really\r\nimperative that I should go. I am pledged to an appointment at the\r\nHouse at twelve, and it wants now only a quarter. I regret that your\r\ninterview with me should be so unsatisfactory, but I can only promise\r\nyou that I will see Mr. Fitzgibbon."\r\n\r\n"And when shall I call again, Mr. Finn?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I had better write to you," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no," said Mr. Clarkson. "I should much prefer to look in.\r\nLooking in is always best. We can get to understand one another in\r\nthat way. Let me see. I daresay you\'re not particular. Suppose I say\r\nSunday morning."\r\n\r\n"Really, I could not see you on Sunday morning, Mr. Clarkson."\r\n\r\n"Parliament gents ain\'t generally particular,--\'speciaily not among\r\nthe Catholics," pleaded Mr. Clarkson.\r\n\r\n"I am always engaged on Sundays," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Suppose we say Monday,--or Tuesday. Tuesday morning at eleven. And\r\ndo be punctual, Mr. Finn. At Tuesday morning I\'ll come, and then no\r\ndoubt I shall find you ready." Whereupon Mr. Clarkson slowly put up\r\nhis bills within his portfolio, and then, before Phineas knew where\r\nhe was, had warmly shaken that poor dismayed member of Parliament by\r\nthe hand. "Only do be punctual, Mr. Finn," he said, as he made his\r\nway down the stairs.\r\n\r\nIt was now twelve, and Phineas rushed off to a cab. He was in such\r\na fervour of rage and misery that he could hardly think of his\r\nposition, or what he had better do, till he got into the Committee\r\nRoom; and when there he could think of nothing else. He intended to\r\ngo deeply into the question of potted peas, holding an equal balance\r\nbetween the assailed Government offices on the one hand, and the\r\nadvocates of the potted peas on the other. The potters of the peas,\r\nwho wanted to sell their article to the Crown, declared that an\r\nextensive,--perhaps we may say, an unlimited,--use of the article\r\nwould save the whole army and navy from the scourges of scurvy,\r\ndyspepsia, and rheumatism, would be the best safeguard against\r\ntyphus and other fevers, and would be an invaluable aid in all other\r\nmaladies to which soldiers and sailors are peculiarly subject. The\r\npeas in question were grown on a large scale in Holstein, and their\r\ngrowth had been fostered with the special object of doing good to the\r\nBritish army and navy. The peas were so cheap that there would be a\r\ngreat saving in money,--and it really had seemed to many that the\r\nofficials of the Horse Guards and the Admiralty had been actuated\r\nby some fiendish desire to deprive their men of salutary fresh\r\nvegetables, simply because they were of foreign growth. But the\r\nofficials of the War Office and the Admiralty declared that the\r\npotted peas in question were hardly fit for swine. The motion for the\r\nCommittee had been made by a gentleman of the opposition, and Phineas\r\nhad been put upon it as an independent member. He had resolved to\r\ngive it all his mind, and, as far as he was concerned, to reach a\r\njust decision, in which there should be no favour shown to the\r\nGovernment side. New brooms are proverbial for thorough work,\r\nand in this Committee work Phineas was as yet a new broom. But,\r\nunfortunately, on this day his mind was so harassed that he could\r\nhardly understand what was going on. It did not, perhaps, much\r\nsignify, as the witnesses examined were altogether agricultural. They\r\nonly proved the production of peas in Holstein,--a fact as to which\r\nPhineas had no doubt. The proof was naturally slow, as the evidence\r\nwas given in German, and had to be translated into English. And\r\nthe work of the day was much impeded by a certain member who\r\nunfortunately spoke German, who seemed to be fond of speaking German\r\nbefore his brethren of the Committee, and who was curious as to\r\nagriculture in Holstein generally. The chairman did not understand\r\nGerman, and there was a difficulty in checking this gentleman, and\r\nin making him understand that his questions were not relevant to the\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nPhineas could not keep his mind during the whole afternoon from the\r\nsubject of his misfortune. What should he do if this horrid man came\r\nto him once or twice a week? He certainly did owe the man the money.\r\nHe must admit that to himself. The man no doubt was a dishonest\r\nknave who had discounted the bill probably at fifty per cent; but,\r\nnevertheless, Phineas had made himself legally responsible for the\r\namount. The privilege of the House prohibited him from arrest. He\r\nthought of that very often, but the thought only made him the more\r\nunhappy. Would it not be said, and might it not be said truly, that\r\nhe had incurred this responsibility,--a responsibility which he was\r\naltogether unequal to answer,--because he was so protected? He did\r\nfeel that a certain consciousness of his privilege had been present\r\nto him when he had put his name across the paper, and there had been\r\ndishonesty in that very consciousness. And of what service would his\r\nprivilege be to him, if this man could harass every hour of his\r\nlife? The man was to be with him again in a day or two, and when the\r\nappointment had been proposed, he, Phineas, had not dared to negative\r\nit. And how was he to escape? As for paying the bill, that with him\r\nwas altogether impossible. The man had told him,--and he had believed\r\nthe man,--that payment by Fitzgibbon was out of the question. And\r\nyet Fitzgibbon was the son of a peer, whereas he was only the son of\r\na country doctor! Of course Fitzgibbon must make some effort,--some\r\ngreat effort,--and have the thing settled. Alas, alas! He knew enough\r\nof the world already to feel that the hope was vain.\r\n\r\nHe went down from the Committee Room into the House, and he dined\r\nat the House, and remained there until eight or nine at night; but\r\nFitzgibbon did not come. He then went to the Reform Club, but he was\r\nnot there. Both at the club and in the House many men spoke to him\r\nabout the debate of the previous night, expressing surprise that he\r\nhad not spoken,--making him more and more wretched. He saw Mr. Monk,\r\nbut Mr. Monk was walking arm in arm with his colleague, Mr. Palliser,\r\nand Phineas could do no more than just speak to them. He thought that\r\nMr. Monk\'s nod of recognition was very cold. That might be fancy, but\r\nit certainly was a fact that Mr. Monk only nodded to him. He would\r\ntell Mr. Monk the truth, and then, if Mr. Monk chose to quarrel with\r\nhim, he at any rate would take no step to renew their friendship.\r\n\r\nFrom the Reform Club he went to the Shakspeare, a smaller club to\r\nwhich Fitzgibbon belonged,--and of which Phineas much wished to\r\nbecome a member,--and to which he knew that his friend resorted when\r\nhe wished to enjoy himself thoroughly, and to be at ease in his\r\ninn. Men at the Shakspeare could do as they pleased. There were no\r\npolitics there, no fashion, no stiffness, and no rules,--so men said;\r\nbut that was hardly true. Everybody called everybody by his Christian\r\nname, and members smoked all over the house. They who did not belong\r\nto the Shakspeare thought it an Elysium upon earth; and they who\r\ndid, believed it to be among Pandemoniums the most pleasant. Phineas\r\ncalled at the Shakspeare, and was told by the porter that Mr.\r\nFitzgibbon was up-stairs. He was shown into the strangers room, and\r\nin five minutes his friend came down to him.\r\n\r\n"I want you to come down to the Reform with me," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"By jingo, my dear fellow, I\'m in the middle of a rubber of whist."\r\n\r\n"There has been a man with me about that bill."\r\n\r\n"What;--Clarkson?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Clarkson," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t mind him," said Fitzgibbon.\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense. How am I to help minding him? I must mind him. He\r\nis coming to me again on Tuesday morning."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t see him."\r\n\r\n"How can I help seeing him?"\r\n\r\n"Make them say you\'re not at home."\r\n\r\n"He has made an appointment. He has told me that he\'ll never leave me\r\nalone. He\'ll be the death of me if this is not settled."\r\n\r\n"It shall be settled, my dear fellow. I\'ll see about it. I\'ll see\r\nabout it and write you a line. You must excuse me now, because those\r\nfellows are waiting. I\'ll have it all arranged."\r\n\r\nAgain as Phineas went home he thoroughly wished that he had not\r\nseceded from Mr. Low.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nLady Baldock at Home\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of March Lady Baldock came up from Baddingham to\r\nLondon, coerced into doing so, as Violet Effingham declared, in\r\nthorough opposition to all her own tastes, by the known wishes of her\r\nfriends and relatives. Her friends and relatives, so Miss Effingham\r\ninsinuated, were unanimous in wishing that Lady Baldock should\r\nremain at Baddingham Park, and therefore,--that wish having been\r\nindiscreetly expressed,--she had put herself to great inconvenience,\r\nand had come to London in March. "Gustavus will go mad," said Violet\r\nto Lady Laura. The Gustavus in question was the Lord Baldock of the\r\npresent generation, Miss Effingham\'s Lady Baldock being the peer\'s\r\nmother. "Why does not Lord Baldock take a house himself?" asked Lady\r\nLaura. "Don\'t you know, my dear," Violet answered, "how much we\r\nBaddingham people think of money? We don\'t like being vexed and\r\ndriven mad, but even that is better than keeping up two households."\r\nAs regarded Violet, the injury arising from Lady Baldock\'s early\r\nmigration was very great, for she was thus compelled to move from\r\nGrosvenor Place to Lady Baldock\'s house in Berkeley Square. "As you\r\nare so fond of being in London, Augusta and I have made up our minds\r\nto come up before Easter," Lady Baldock had written to her.\r\n\r\n"I shall go to her now," Violet had said to her friend, "because I\r\nhave not quite made up my mind as to what I will do for the future."\r\n\r\n"Marry Oswald, and be your own mistress."\r\n\r\n"I mean to be my own mistress without marrying Oswald, though I don\'t\r\nsee my way quite clearly as yet. I think I shall set up a little\r\nhouse of my own, and let the world say what it pleases. I suppose\r\nthey couldn\'t make me out to be a lunatic."\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t wonder if they were to try," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"They could not prevent me in any other way. But I am in the dark as\r\nyet, and so I shall be obedient and go to my aunt."\r\n\r\nMiss Effingham went to Berkeley Square, and Phineas Finn was\r\nintroduced to Lady Baldock. He had been often in Grosvenor Place,\r\nand had seen Violet frequently. Mr. Kennedy gave periodical\r\ndinners,--once a week,--to which everybody went who could get an\r\ninvitation; and Phineas had been a guest more than once. Indeed, in\r\nspite of his miseries he had taken to dining out a good deal, and was\r\npopular as an eater of dinners. He could talk when wanted, and did\r\nnot talk too much, was pleasant in manners and appearance, and had\r\nalready achieved a certain recognised position in London life. Of\r\nthose who knew him intimately, not one in twenty were aware from\r\nwhence he came, what was his parentage, or what his means of living.\r\nHe was a member of Parliament, a friend of Mr. Kennedy\'s, was\r\nintimate with Mr. Monk, though an Irishman did not as a rule herd\r\nwith other Irishmen, and was the right sort of person to have at your\r\nhouse. Some people said he was a cousin of Lord Brentford\'s, and\r\nothers declared that he was Lord Chiltern\'s earliest friend. There he\r\nwas, however, with a position gained, and even Lady Baldock asked him\r\nto her house.\r\n\r\nLady Baldock had evenings. People went to her house, and stood about\r\nthe room and on the stairs, talked to each other for half an hour,\r\nand went away. In these March days there was no crowding, but still\r\nthere were always enough of people there to show that Lady Baldock\r\nwas successful. Why people should have gone to Lady Baldock\'s I\r\ncannot explain;--but there are houses to which people go without\r\nany reason. Phineas received a little card asking him to go, and he\r\nalways went.\r\n\r\n"I think you like my friend, Mr. Finn," Lady Laura said to Miss\r\nEffingham, after the first of these evenings.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do. I like him decidedly."\r\n\r\n"So do I. I should hardly have thought that you would have taken a\r\nfancy to him."\r\n\r\n"I hardly know what you call taking a fancy," said Violet. "I am not\r\nquite sure I like to be told that I have taken a fancy for a young\r\nman."\r\n\r\n"I mean no offence, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Of course you don\'t But, to speak truth, I think I have rather taken\r\na fancy to him. There is just enough of him, but not too much. I\r\ndon\'t mean materially,--in regard to his inches; but as to his mental\r\nbelongings. I hate a stupid man who can\'t talk to me, and I hate a\r\nclever man who talks me down. I don\'t like a man who is too lazy to\r\nmake any effort to shine; but I particularly dislike the man who is\r\nalways striving for effect. I abominate a humble man, but yet I love\r\nto perceive that a man acknowledges the superiority of my sex, and\r\nyouth, and all that kind of thing."\r\n\r\n"You want to be flattered without plain flattery."\r\n\r\n"Of course I do. A man who would tell me that I am pretty, unless he\r\nis over seventy, ought to be kicked out of the room. But a man who\r\ncan\'t show me that he thinks me so without saying a word about it,\r\nis a lout. Now in all those matters, your friend, Mr. Finn, seems to\r\nknow what he is about. In other words, he makes himself pleasant,\r\nand, therefore, one is glad to see him."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you do not mean to fall in love with him?"\r\n\r\n"Not that I know of, my dear. But when I do, I\'ll be sure to give you\r\nnotice."\r\n\r\nI fear that there was more of earnestness in Lady Laura\'s last\r\nquestion than Miss Effingham had supposed. She had declared to\r\nherself over and over again that she had never been in love with\r\nPhineas Finn. She had acknowledged to herself, before Mr. Kennedy had\r\nasked her hand in marriage, that there had been danger,--that she\r\ncould have learned to love the man if such love would not have been\r\nruinous to her,--that the romance of such a passion would have been\r\npleasant to her. She had gone farther than this, and had said to\r\nherself that she would have given way to that romance, and would have\r\nbeen ready to accept such love if offered to her, had she not put\r\nit out of her own power to marry a poor man by her generosity to\r\nher brother. Then she had thrust the thing aside, and had clearly\r\nunderstood,--she thought that she had clearly understood,--that life\r\nfor her must be a matter of business. Was it not the case with nine\r\nout of every ten among mankind, with nine hundred and ninety-nine out\r\nof every thousand, that life must be a matter of business and not of\r\nromance? Of course she could not marry Mr. Finn, knowing, as she did,\r\nthat neither of them had a shilling. Of all men in the world she\r\nesteemed Mr. Kennedy the most, and when these thoughts were passing\r\nthrough her mind, she was well aware that he would ask her to be\r\nhis wife. Had she not resolved that she would accept the offer, she\r\nwould not have gone to Loughlinter. Having put aside all romance as\r\nunfitted to her life, she could, she thought, do her duty as Mr.\r\nKennedy\'s wife. She would teach herself to love him. Nay,--she had\r\ntaught herself to love him. She was at any rate so sure of her\r\nown heart that she would never give her husband cause to rue the\r\nconfidence he placed in her. And yet there was something sore within\r\nher when she thought that Phineas Finn was fond of Violet Effingham.\r\n\r\nIt was Lady Baldock\'s second evening, and Phineas came to the house\r\nat about eleven o\'clock. At this time he had encountered a second\r\nand a third interview with Mr. Clarkson, and had already failed in\r\nobtaining any word of comfort from Laurence Fitzgibbon about the\r\nbill. It was clear enough now that Laurence felt that they were both\r\nmade safe by their privilege, and that Mr. Clarkson should be treated\r\nas you treat the organ-grinders. They are a nuisance and must be\r\nendured. But the nuisance is not so great but what you can live in\r\ncomfort,--if only you are not too sore as to the annoyance. "My dear\r\nfellow," Laurence had said to him, "I have had Clarkson almost living\r\nin my rooms. He used to drink nearly a pint of sherry a day for me.\r\nAll I looked to was that I didn\'t live there at the same time. If you\r\nwish it, I\'ll send in the sherry." This was very bad, and Phineas\r\ntried to quarrel with his friend; but he found that it was difficult\r\nto quarrel with Laurence Fitzgibbon.\r\n\r\nBut though on this side Phineas was very miserable, on another side\r\nhe had obtained great comfort. Mr. Monk and he were better friends\r\nthan ever. "As to what Turnbull says about me in the House," Mr.\r\nMonk had said, laughing; "he and I understand each other perfectly.\r\nI should like to see you on your legs, but it is just as well,\r\nperhaps, that you have deferred it. We shall have the real question\r\non immediately after Easter, and then you\'ll have plenty of\r\nopportunities." Phineas had explained how he had attempted, how he\r\nhad failed, and how he had suffered;--and Mr. Monk had been generous\r\nin his sympathy. "I know all about it," said he, "and have gone\r\nthrough it all myself. The more respect you feel for the House,\r\nthe more satisfaction you will have in addressing it when you have\r\nmastered this difficulty."\r\n\r\nThe first person who spoke to Phineas at Lady Baldock\'s was Miss\r\nFitzgibbon, Laurence\'s sister. Aspasia Fitzgibbon was a warm woman as\r\nregarded money, and as she was moreover a most discreet spinster,\r\nshe was made welcome by Lady Baldock, in spite of the well-known\r\niniquities of her male relatives. "Mr. Finn," said she, "how d\'ye do?\r\nI want to say a word to ye. Just come here into the corner." Phineas,\r\nnot knowing how to escape, did retreat into the corner with Miss\r\nFitzgibbon. "Tell me now, Mr. Finn;--have ye been lending money to\r\nLaurence?"\r\n\r\n"No; I have lent him no money," said Phineas, much astonished by the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t. That\'s my advice to ye. Don\'t. On any other matter Laurence\r\nis the best creature in the world,--but he\'s bad to lend money to.\r\nYou ain\'t in any hobble with him, then?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--nothing to speak of. What makes you ask?"\r\n\r\n"Then you are in a hobble? Dear, dear! I never saw such a man as\r\nLaurence;--never. Good-bye. I wouldn\'t do it again, if I were\r\nyou;--that\'s all." Then Miss Fitzgibbon came out of the corner and\r\nmade her way down-stairs.\r\n\r\nPhineas immediately afterwards came across Miss Effingham. "I did not\r\nknow," said she, "that you and the divine Aspasia were such close\r\nallies."\r\n\r\n"We are the dearest friends in the world, but she has taken my breath\r\naway now."\r\n\r\n"May a body be told how she has done that?" Violet asked.\r\n\r\n"Well, no; I\'m afraid not, even though the body be Miss Effingham. It\r\nwas a profound secret;--really a secret concerning a third person,\r\nand she began about it just as though she were speaking about the\r\nweather!"\r\n\r\n"How charming! I do so like her. You haven\'t heard, have you, that\r\nMr. Ratler proposed to her the other day?"\r\n\r\n"No!"\r\n\r\n"But he did;--at least, so she tells everybody. She said she\'d take\r\nhim if he would promise to get her brother\'s salary doubled."\r\n\r\n"Did she tell you?"\r\n\r\n"No; not me. And of course I don\'t believe a word of it. I suppose\r\nBarrington Erle made up the story. Are you going out of town next\r\nweek, Mr. Finn?" The week next to this was Easter-week. "I heard you\r\nwere going into Northamptonshire."\r\n\r\n"From Lady Laura?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--from Lady Laura."\r\n\r\n"I intend to spend three days with Lord Chiltern at Willingford. It\r\nis an old promise. I am going to ride his horses,--that is, if I am\r\nable to ride them."\r\n\r\n"Take care what you are about, Mr. Finn;--they say his horses are so\r\ndangerous!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m rather good at falling, I flatter myself."\r\n\r\n"I know that Lord Chiltern rides anything he can sit, so long as it\r\nis some animal that nobody else will ride. It was always so with him.\r\nHe is so odd; is he not?"\r\n\r\nPhineas knew, of course, that Lord Chiltern had more than once asked\r\nViolet Effingham to be his wife,--and he believed that she, from her\r\nintimacy with Lady Laura, must know that he knew it. He had also\r\nheard Lady Laura express a very strong wish that, in spite of these\r\nrefusals, Violet might even yet become her brother\'s wife. And\r\nPhineas also knew that Violet Effingham was becoming, in his own\r\nestimation, the most charming woman of his acquaintance. How was he\r\nto talk to her about Lord Chiltern?\r\n\r\n"He is odd," said Phineas; "but he is an excellent fellow,--whom his\r\nfather altogether misunderstands."\r\n\r\n"Exactly,--just so; I am so glad to hear you say that,--you who have\r\nnever had the misfortune to have anything to do with a bad set. Why\r\ndon\'t you tell Lord Brentford? Lord Brentford would listen to you."\r\n\r\n"To me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--of course he would,--for you are just the link that is\r\nwanting. You are Chiltern\'s intimate friend, and you are also the\r\nfriend of big-wigs and Cabinet Ministers."\r\n\r\n"Lord Brentford would put me down at once if I spoke to him on such a\r\nsubject."\r\n\r\n"I am sure he would not. You are too big to be put down, and no man\r\ncan really dislike to hear his son well spoken of by those who are\r\nwell spoken of themselves. Won\'t you try, Mr. Finn?" Phineas said\r\nthat he would think of it,--that he would try if any fit opportunity\r\ncould be found. "Of course you know how intimate I have been with the\r\nStandishes," said Violet; "that Laura is to me a sister, and that\r\nOswald used to be almost a brother."\r\n\r\n"Why do not you speak to Lord Brentford;--you who are his favourite?"\r\n\r\n"There are reasons, Mr. Finn. Besides, how can any girl come forward\r\nand say that she knows the disposition of any man? You can live with\r\nLord Chiltern, and see what he is made of, and know his thoughts, and\r\nlearn what is good in him, and also what is bad. After all, how is\r\nany girl really to know anything of a man\'s life?"\r\n\r\n"If I can do anything, Miss Effingham, I will," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"And then we shall all of us be so grateful to you," said Violet,\r\nwith her sweetest smile.\r\n\r\nPhineas, retreating from this conversation, stood for a while alone,\r\nthinking of it. Had she spoken thus of Lord Chiltern because she did\r\nlove him or because she did not? And the sweet commendations which\r\nhad fallen from her lips upon him,--him, Phineas Finn,--were they\r\ncompatible with anything like a growing partiality for himself, or\r\nwere they incompatible with any such feeling? Had he most reason to\r\nbe comforted or to be discomfited by what had taken place? It seemed\r\nhardly possible to his imagination that Violet Effingham should\r\nlove such a nobody as he. And yet he had had fair evidence that one\r\nstanding as high in the world as Violet Effingham would fain have\r\nloved him could she have followed the dictates of her heart. He had\r\ntrembled when he had first resolved to declare his passion to Lady\r\nLaura,--fearing that she would scorn him as being presumptuous. But\r\nthere had been no cause for such fear as that. He had declared his\r\nlove, and she had not thought him to be presumptuous. That now was\r\nages ago,--eight months since; and Lady Laura had become a married\r\nwoman. Since he had become so warmly alive to the charms of Violet\r\nEffingham he had determined, with stern propriety, that a passion for\r\na married woman was disgraceful. Such love was in itself a sin, even\r\nthough it was accompanied by the severest forbearance and the most\r\nrigid propriety of conduct. No;--Lady Laura had done wisely to check\r\nthe growing feeling of partiality which she had admitted; and now\r\nthat she was married, he would be as wise as she. It was clear to him\r\nthat, as regarded his own heart, the way was open to him for a new\r\nenterprise. But what if he were to fail again, and be told by Violet,\r\nwhen he declared his love, that she had just engaged herself to Lord\r\nChiltern!\r\n\r\n"What were you and Violet talking about so eagerly?" said Lady Laura\r\nto him, with a smile that, in its approach to laughter, almost\r\nbetrayed its mistress.\r\n\r\n"We were talking about your brother."\r\n\r\n"You are going to him, are you not?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I leave London on Sunday night;--but only for a day or two."\r\n\r\n"Has he any chance there, do you think?"\r\n\r\n"What, with Miss Effingham?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--with Violet. Sometimes I think she loves him."\r\n\r\n"How can I say? In such a matter you can judge better than I can do.\r\nOne woman with reference to another can draw the line between love\r\nand friendship. She certainly likes Chiltern."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I believe she loves him. I do indeed. But she fears him. She\r\ndoes not quite understand how much there is of tenderness with that\r\nassumed ferocity. And Oswald is so strange, so unwise, so impolitic,\r\nthat though he loves her better than all the world beside, he will\r\nnot sacrifice even a turn of a word to win her. When he asks her to\r\nmarry him, he almost flies at her throat, as an angry debtor who\r\napplies for instant payment. Tell him, Mr. Finn, never to give it\r\nover;--and teach him that he should be soft with her. Tell him, also,\r\nthat in her heart she likes him. One woman, as you say, knows another\r\nwoman; and I am certain he would win her if he would only be gentle\r\nwith her." Then, again, before they parted, Lady Laura told him that\r\nthis marriage was the dearest wish of her heart, and that there would\r\nbe no end to her gratitude if Phineas could do anything to promote\r\nit. All which again made our hero unhappy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nSunday in Grosvenor Place\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Kennedy, though he was a most scrupulously attentive member of\r\nParliament, was a man very punctual to hours and rules in his own\r\nhouse,--and liked that his wife should be as punctual as himself.\r\nLady Laura, who in marrying him had firmly resolved that she would do\r\nher duty to him in all ways, even though the ways might sometimes be\r\npainful,--and had been perhaps more punctilious in this respect than\r\nshe might have been had she loved him heartily,--was not perhaps\r\nquite so fond of accurate regularity as her husband; and thus, by\r\nthis time, certain habits of his had become rather bonds than habits\r\nto her. He always had prayers at nine, and breakfasted at a quarter\r\npast nine, let the hours on the night before have been as late as\r\nthey might before the time for rest had come. After breakfast he\r\nwould open his letters in his study, but he liked her to be with\r\nhim, and desired to discuss with her every application he got from\r\na constituent. He had his private secretary in a room apart, but he\r\nthought that everything should be filtered to his private secretary\r\nthrough his wife. He was very anxious that she herself should\r\nsuperintend the accounts of their own private expenditure, and had\r\ntaken some trouble to teach her an excellent mode of book-keeping.\r\nHe had recommended to her a certain course of reading,--which was\r\npleasant enough; ladies like to receive such recommendations; but Mr.\r\nKennedy, having drawn out the course, seemed to expect that his wife\r\nshould read the books he had named, and, worse still, that she should\r\nread them in the time he had allocated for the work. This, I think,\r\nwas tyranny. Then the Sundays became very wearisome to Lady Laura.\r\nGoing to church twice, she had learnt, would be a part of her duty;\r\nand though in her father\'s household attendance at church had never\r\nbeen very strict, she had made up her mind to this cheerfully. But\r\nMr. Kennedy expected also that he and she should always dine together\r\non Sundays, that there should be no guests, and that there should be\r\nno evening company. After all, the demand was not very severe, but\r\nyet she found that it operated injuriously upon her comfort. The\r\nSundays were very wearisome to her, and made her feel that her lord\r\nand master was--her lord and master. She made an effort or two to\r\nescape, but the efforts were all in vain. He never spoke a cross word\r\nto her. He never gave a stern command. But yet he had his way. "I\r\nwon\'t say that reading a novel on a Sunday is a sin," he said; "but\r\nwe must at any rate admit that it is a matter on which men disagree,\r\nthat many of the best of men are against such occupation on Sunday,\r\nand that to abstain is to be on the safe side." So the novels were\r\nput away, and Sunday afternoon with the long evening became rather\r\na stumbling-block to Lady Laura.\r\n\r\nThose two hours, moreover, with her husband in the morning became\r\nvery wearisome to her. At first she had declared that it would be her\r\ngreatest ambition to help her husband in his work, and she had read\r\nall the letters from the MacNabs and MacFies, asking to be made\r\ngaugers and landing-waiters, with an assumed interest. But the work\r\npalled upon her very quickly. Her quick intellect discovered soon\r\nthat there was nothing in it which she really did. It was all form\r\nand verbiage, and pretence at business. Her husband went through it\r\nall with the utmost patience, reading every word, giving orders as\r\nto every detail, and conscientiously doing that which he conceived\r\nhe had undertaken to do. But Lady Laura wanted to meddle with high\r\npolitics, to discuss reform bills, to assist in putting up Mr. This\r\nand putting down my Lord That. Why should she waste her time in\r\ndoing that which the lad in the next room, who was called a private\r\nsecretary, could do as well?\r\n\r\nStill she would obey. Let the task be as hard as it might, she would\r\nobey. If he counselled her to do this or that, she would follow his\r\ncounsel,--because she owed him so much. If she had accepted the half\r\nof all his wealth without loving him, she owed him the more on that\r\naccount. But she knew,--she could not but know,--that her intellect\r\nwas brighter than his; and might it not be possible for her to lead\r\nhim? Then she made efforts to lead her husband, and found that he was\r\nas stiff-necked as an ox. Mr. Kennedy was not, perhaps, a clever man;\r\nbut he was a man who knew his own way, and who intended to keep it.\r\n\r\n"I have got a headache, Robert," she said to him one Sunday after\r\nluncheon. "I think I will not go to church this afternoon."\r\n\r\n"It is not serious, I hope."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear no. Don\'t you know how one feels sometimes that one has got\r\na head? And when that is the case one\'s armchair is the best place."\r\n\r\n"I am not sure of that," said Mr. Kennedy.\r\n\r\n"If I went to church I should not attend," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"The fresh air would do you more good than anything else, and we\r\ncould walk across the park."\r\n\r\n"Thank you;--I won\'t go out again to-day." This she said with\r\nsomething almost of crossness in her manner, and Mr. Kennedy went to\r\nthe afternoon service by himself.\r\n\r\nLady Laura when she was left alone began to think of her position.\r\nShe was not more than four or five months married, and she was\r\nbecoming very tired of her life. Was it not also true that she was\r\nbecoming tired of her husband? She had twice told Phineas Finn that\r\nof all men in the world she esteemed Mr. Kennedy the most. She did\r\nnot esteem him less now. She knew no point or particle in which\r\nhe did not do his duty with accuracy. But no person can live\r\nhappily with another,--not even with a brother or a sister or a\r\nfriend,--simply upon esteem. All the virtues in the calendar,\r\nthough they exist on each side, will not make a man and woman happy\r\ntogether, unless there be sympathy. Lady Laura was beginning to\r\nfind out that there was a lack of sympathy between herself and her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nShe thought of this till she was tired of thinking of it, and then,\r\nwishing to divert her mind, she took up the book that was lying\r\nnearest to her hand. It was a volume of a new novel which she had\r\nbeen reading on the previous day, and now, without much thought about\r\nit, she went on with her reading. There came to her, no doubt, some\r\ndim, half-formed idea that, as she was freed from going to church by\r\nthe plea of a headache, she was also absolved by the same plea from\r\nother Sunday hindrances. A child, when it is ill, has buttered toast\r\nand a picture-book instead of bread-and-milk and lessons. In this\r\nway, Lady Laura conceived herself to be entitled to her novel.\r\n\r\nWhile she was reading it, there came a knock at the door, and\r\nBarrington Erle was shown upstairs. Mr. Kennedy had given no orders\r\nagainst Sunday visitors, but had simply said that Sunday visiting was\r\nnot to his taste. Barrington, however, was Lady Laura\'s cousin, and\r\npeople must be very strict if they can\'t see their cousins on Sunday.\r\nLady Laura soon lost her headache altogether in the animation\r\nof discussing the chances of the new Reform Bill with the Prime\r\nMinister\'s private secretary; and had left her chair, and was\r\nstanding by the table with the novel in her hand, protesting this\r\nand denying that, expressing infinite confidence in Mr. Monk, and\r\nviolently denouncing Mr. Turnbull, when her husband returned from\r\nchurch and came up into the drawing-room. Lady Laura had forgotten\r\nher headache altogether, and had in her composition none of that\r\nthoughtfulness of hypocrisy which would have taught her to moderate\r\nher political feeling at her husband\'s return.\r\n\r\n"I do declare," she said, "that if Mr. Turnbull opposes the\r\nGovernment measure now, because he can\'t have his own way in\r\neverything, I will never again put my trust in any man who calls\r\nhimself a popular leader."\r\n\r\n"You never should," said Barrington Erle.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all very well for you, Barrington, who are an aristocratic\r\nWhig of the old official school, and who call yourself a Liberal\r\nsimply because Fox was a Liberal a hundred years ago. My heart\'s in\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Heart should never have anything to do with politics; should it?"\r\nsaid Erle, turning round to Mr. Kennedy.\r\n\r\nMr. Kennedy did not wish to discuss the matter on a Sunday, nor yet\r\ndid he wish to say before Barrington Erle that he thought it wrong\r\nto do so. And he was desirous of treating his wife in some way\r\nas though she were an invalid,--that she thereby might be, as it\r\nwere, punished; but he did not wish to do this in such a way that\r\nBarrington should be aware of the punishment.\r\n\r\n"Laura had better not disturb herself about it now," he said.\r\n\r\n"How is a person to help being disturbed?" said Lady Laura, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Well, well; we won\'t mind all that now," said Mr. Kennedy, turning\r\naway. Then he took up the novel which Lady Laura had just laid down\r\nfrom her hand, and, having looked at it, carried it aside, and placed\r\nit on a book-shelf which was remote from them. Lady Laura watched him\r\nas he did this, and the whole course of her husband\'s thoughts on the\r\nsubject was open to her at once. She regretted the novel, and she\r\nregretted also the political discussion. Soon afterwards Barrington\r\nErle went away, and the husband and wife were alone together.\r\n\r\n"I am glad that your head is so much better," said he. He did not\r\nintend to be severe, but he spoke with a gravity of manner which\r\nalmost amounted to severity.\r\n\r\n"Yes; it is," she said, "Barrington\'s coming in cheered me up."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry that you should have wanted cheering."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know what I mean, Robert?"\r\n\r\n"No; I do not think that I do, exactly."\r\n\r\n"I suppose your head is stronger. You do not get that feeling\r\nof dazed, helpless imbecility of brain, which hardly amounts to\r\nheadache, but which yet--is almost as bad."\r\n\r\n"Imbecility of brain may be worse than headache, but I don\'t think it\r\ncan produce it."\r\n\r\n"Well, well;--I don\'t know how to explain it."\r\n\r\n"Headache comes, I think, always from the stomach, even when produced\r\nby nervous affections. But imbecility of the brain--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Robert, I am so sorry that I used the word."\r\n\r\n"I see that it did not prevent your reading," he said, after a pause.\r\n\r\n"Not such reading as that. I was up to nothing better."\r\n\r\nThen there was another pause.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t deny that it may be a prejudice," he said, "but I confess\r\nthat the use of novels in my own house on Sundays is a pain to me.\r\nMy mother\'s ideas on the subject are very strict, and I cannot think\r\nthat it is bad for a son to hang on to the teaching of his mother."\r\nThis he said in the most serious tone which he could command.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why I took it up," said Lady Laura. "Simply, I believe,\r\nbecause it was there. I will avoid doing so for the future."\r\n\r\n"Do, my dear," said the husband. "I shall be obliged and grateful if\r\nyou will remember what I have said." Then he left her, and she sat\r\nalone, first in the dusk and then in the dark, for two hours, doing\r\nnothing. Was this to be the life which she had procured for herself\r\nby marrying Mr. Kennedy of Loughlinter? If it was harsh and\r\nunendurable in London, what would it be in the country?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nThe Willingford Bull\r\n\r\n\r\nPhineas left London by a night mail train on Easter Sunday, and found\r\nhimself at the Willingford Bull about half an hour after midnight.\r\nLord Chiltern was up and waiting for him, and supper was on the\r\ntable. The Willingford Bull was an English inn of the old stamp,\r\nwhich had now, in these latter years of railway travelling, ceased\r\nto have a road business,--for there were no travellers on the road,\r\nand but little posting--but had acquired a new trade as a depot for\r\nhunters and hunting men. The landlord let out horses and kept hunting\r\nstables, and the house was generally filled from the beginning of\r\nNovember till the middle of April. Then it became a desert in the\r\nsummer, and no guests were seen there, till the pink coats flocked\r\ndown again into the shires.\r\n\r\n"How many days do you mean to give us?" said Lord Chiltern, as he\r\nhelped his friend to a devilled leg of turkey.\r\n\r\n"I must go back on Wednesday," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"That means Wednesday night. I\'ll tell you what we\'ll do. We\'ve the\r\nCottesmore to-morrow. We\'ll get into Tailby\'s country on Tuesday, and\r\nFitzwilliam will be only twelve miles off on Wednesday. We shall be\r\nrather short of horses."\r\n\r\n"Pray don\'t let me put you out. I can hire something here, I\r\nsuppose?"\r\n\r\n"You won\'t put me out at all. There\'ll be three between us each day,\r\nand we\'ll run our luck. The horses have gone on to Empingham for\r\nto-morrow. Tailby is rather a way off,--at Somerby; but we\'ll manage\r\nit. If the worst comes to the worst, we can get back to Stamford by\r\nrail. On Wednesday we shall have everything very comfortable. They\'re\r\nout beyond Stilton and will draw home our way. I\'ve planned it all\r\nout. I\'ve a trap with a fast stepper, and if we start to-morrow at\r\nhalf-past nine, we shall be in plenty of time. You shall ride Meg\r\nMerrilies, and if she don\'t carry you, you may shoot her."\r\n\r\n"Is she one of the pulling ones?"\r\n\r\n"She is heavy in hand if you are heavy at her, but leave her mouth\r\nalone and she\'ll go like flowing water. You\'d better not ride more\r\nin a crowd than you can help. Now what\'ll you drink?"\r\n\r\nThey sat up half the night smoking and talking, and Phineas learned\r\nmore about Lord Chiltern then than ever he had learned before. There\r\nwas brandy and water before them, but neither of them drank. Lord\r\nChiltern, indeed, had a pint of beer by his side from which he sipped\r\noccasionally. "I\'ve taken to beer," he said, "as being the best drink\r\ngoing. When a man hunts six days a week he can afford to drink beer.\r\nI\'m on an allowance,--three pints a day. That\'s not too much."\r\n\r\n"And you drink nothing else?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing when I\'m alone,--except a little cherry-brandy when I\'m out.\r\nI never cared for drink;--never in my life. I do like excitement, and\r\nhave been less careful than I ought to have been as to what it has\r\ncome from. I could give up drink to-morrow, without a struggle,--if\r\nit were worth my while to make up my mind to do it. And it\'s the same\r\nwith gambling. I never do gamble now, because I\'ve got no money; but\r\nI own I like it better than anything in the world. While you are at\r\nit, there is life in it."\r\n\r\n"You should take to politics, Chiltern."\r\n\r\n"And I would have done so, but my father would not help me. Never\r\nmind, we will not talk about him. How does Laura get on with her\r\nhusband?"\r\n\r\n"Very happily, I should say."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe it," said Lord Chiltern. "Her temper is too much\r\nlike mine to allow her to be happy with such a log of wood as Robert\r\nKennedy. It is such men as he who drive me out of the pale of decent\r\nlife. If that is decency, I\'d sooner be indecent. You mark my words.\r\nThey\'ll come to grief. She\'ll never be able to stand it."\r\n\r\n"I should think she had her own way in everything," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"No, no. Though he\'s a prig, he\'s a man; and she will not find it\r\neasy to drive him."\r\n\r\n"But she may bend him."\r\n\r\n"Not an inch;--that is if I understand his character. I suppose you\r\nsee a good deal of them?"\r\n\r\n"Yes,--pretty well. I\'m not there so often as I used to be in the\r\nSquare."\r\n\r\n"You get sick of it, I suppose. I should. Do you see my father\r\noften?"\r\n\r\n"Only occasionally. He is always very civil when I do see him."\r\n\r\n"He is the very pink of civility when he pleases, but the most unjust\r\nman I ever met."\r\n\r\n"I should not have thought that."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he is," said the Earl\'s son, "and all from lack of judgment to\r\ndiscern the truth. He makes up his mind to a thing on insufficient\r\nproof, and then nothing will turn him. He thinks well of you,--would\r\nprobably believe your word on any indifferent subject without thought\r\nof a doubt; but if you were to tell him that I didn\'t get drunk every\r\nnight of my life and spend most of my time in thrashing policemen, he\r\nwould not believe you. He would smile incredulously and make you a\r\nlittle bow. I can see him do it."\r\n\r\n"You are too hard on him, Chiltern."\r\n\r\n"He has been too hard on me, I know. Is Violet Effingham still in\r\nGrosvenor Place?"\r\n\r\n"No; she\'s with Lady Baldock."\r\n\r\n"That old grandmother of evil has come to town,--has she? Poor\r\nViolet! When we were young together we used to have such fun about\r\nthat old woman."\r\n\r\n"The old woman is an ally of mine now," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"You make allies everywhere. You know Violet Effingham of course?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes. I know her."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think her very charming?" said Lord Chiltern.\r\n\r\n"Exceedingly charming."\r\n\r\n"I have asked that girl to marry me three times, and I shall never\r\nask her again. There is a point beyond which a man shouldn\'t go.\r\nThere are many reasons why it would be a good marriage. In the first\r\nplace, her money would be serviceable. Then it would heal matters in\r\nour family, for my father is as prejudiced in her favour as he is\r\nagainst me. And I love her dearly. I\'ve loved her all my life,--since\r\nI used to buy cakes for her. But I shall never ask her again."\r\n\r\n"I would if I were you," said Phineas,--hardly knowing what it might\r\nbe best for him to say.\r\n\r\n"No; I never will. But I\'ll tell you what. I shall get into some\r\ndesperate scrape about her. Of course she\'ll marry, and that soon.\r\nThen I shall make a fool of myself. When I hear that she is engaged I\r\nshall go and quarrel with the man, and kick him,--or get kicked. All\r\nthe world will turn against me, and I shall be called a wild beast."\r\n\r\n"A dog in the manger is what you should be called."\r\n\r\n"Exactly;--but how is a man to help it? If you loved a girl, could\r\nyou see another man take her?" Phineas remembered of course that he\r\nhad lately come through this ordeal. "It is as though he were to come\r\nand put his hand upon me, and wanted my own heart out of me. Though\r\nI have no property in her at all, no right to her,--though she never\r\ngave me a word of encouragement, it is as though she were the most\r\nprivate thing in the world to me. I should be half mad, and in my\r\nmadness I could not master the idea that I was being robbed. I should\r\nresent it as a personal interference."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it will come to that if you give her up yourself," said\r\nPhineas.\r\n\r\n"It is no question of giving up. Of course I cannot make her marry\r\nme. Light another cigar, old fellow."\r\n\r\nPhineas, as he lit the other cigar, remembered that he owed a certain\r\nduty in this matter to Lady Laura. She had commissioned him to\r\npersuade her brother that his suit with Violet Effingham would not be\r\nhopeless, if he could only restrain himself in his mode of conducting\r\nit. Phineas was disposed to do his duty, although he felt it to be\r\nvery hard that he should be called upon to be eloquent against his\r\nown interest. He had been thinking for the last quarter of an hour\r\nhow he must bear himself if it might turn out that he should be the\r\nman whom Lord Chiltern was resolved to kick. He looked at his friend\r\nand host, and became aware that a kicking-match with such a one would\r\nnot be pleasant pastime. Nevertheless, he would be happy enough to be\r\nsubject to Lord Chiltern\'s wrath for such a reason. He would do his\r\nduty by Lord Chiltern; and then, when that had been adequately done,\r\nhe would, if occasion served, fight a battle for himself.\r\n\r\n"You are too sudden with her, Chiltern," he said, after a pause.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by too sudden?" said Lord Chiltern, almost angrily.\r\n\r\n"You frighten her by being so impetuous. You rush at her as though\r\nyou wanted to conquer her by a single blow."\r\n\r\n"So I do."\r\n\r\n"You should be more gentle with her. You should give her time to find\r\nout whether she likes you or not."\r\n\r\n"She has known me all her life, and has found that out long ago. Not\r\nbut what you are right. I know you are right. If I were you, and had\r\nyour skill in pleasing, I should drop soft words into her ear till I\r\nhad caught her. But I have no gifts in that way. I am as awkward as\r\na pig at what is called flirting. And I have an accursed pride which\r\nstands in my own light. If she were in this house this moment, and\r\nif I knew she were to be had for asking, I don\'t think I could bring\r\nmyself to ask again. But we\'ll go to bed. It\'s half-past two, and we\r\nmust be off at half-past nine, if we\'re to be at Exton Park gates at\r\neleven."\r\n\r\nPhineas, as he went up-stairs, assured himself that he had done his\r\nduty. If there ever should come to be anything between him and Violet\r\nEffingham, Lord Chiltern might quarrel with him,--might probably\r\nattempt that kicking encounter to which allusion had been made,--but\r\nnobody could justly say that he had not behaved honourably to his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning there was a bustle and a scurry, as there always\r\nis on such occasions, and the two men got off about ten minutes after\r\ntime. But Lord Chiltern drove hard, and they reached the meet before\r\nthe master had moved off. They had a fair day\'s sport with the\r\nCottesmore; and Phineas, though he found that Meg Merrilies did\r\nrequire a good deal of riding, went through his day\'s work with\r\ncredit. He had been riding since he was a child, as is the custom\r\nwith all boys in Munster, and had an Irishman\'s natural aptitude for\r\njumping. When they got back to the Willingford Bull he felt pleased\r\nwith the day and rather proud of himself. "It wasn\'t fast, you know,"\r\nsaid Chiltern, "and I don\'t call that a stiff country. Besides, Meg\r\nis very handy when you\'ve got her out of the crowd. You shall ride\r\nBonebreaker to-morrow at Somerby, and you\'ll find that better fun."\r\n\r\n"Bonebreaker? Haven\'t I heard you say he rushes like mischief?"\r\n\r\n"Well, he does rush. But, by George! you want a horse to rush in that\r\ncountry. When you have to go right through four or five feet of stiff\r\ngreen wood, like a bullet through a target, you want a little force,\r\nor you\'re apt to be left up a tree."\r\n\r\n"And what do you ride?"\r\n\r\n"A brute I never put my leg on yet. He was sent down to Wilcox here,\r\nout of Lincolnshire, because they couldn\'t get anybody to ride him\r\nthere. They say he goes with his head up in the air, and won\'t look\r\nat a fence that isn\'t as high as his breast. But I think he\'ll do\r\nhere. I never saw a better made beast, or one with more power. Do you\r\nlook at his shoulders. He\'s to be had for seventy pounds, and these\r\nare the sort of horses I like to buy."\r\n\r\nAgain they dined alone, and Lord Chiltern explained to Phineas that\r\nhe rarely associated with the men of either of the hunts in which\r\nhe rode. "There is a set of fellows down here who are poison to me,\r\nand there is another set, and I am poison to them. Everybody is\r\nvery civil, as you see, but I have no associates. And gradually I am\r\ngetting to have a reputation as though I were the devil himself. I\r\nthink I shall come out next year dressed entirely in black."\r\n\r\n"Are you not wrong to give way to that kind of thing?"\r\n\r\n"What the deuce am I to do? I can\'t make civil little speeches. When\r\nonce a man gets a reputation as an ogre, it is the most difficult\r\nthing in the world to drop it. I could have a score of men here every\r\nday if I liked it,--my title would do that for me;--but they would\r\nbe men I should loathe, and I should be sure to tell them so,\r\neven though I did not mean it. Bonebreaker, and the new horse,\r\nand another, went on at twelve to-day. You must expect hard work\r\nto-morrow, as I daresay we shan\'t be home before eight."\r\n\r\nThe next day\'s meet was in Leicestershire, not far from Melton, and\r\nthey started early. Phineas, to tell the truth of him, was rather\r\nafraid of Bonebreaker, and looked forward to the probability of an\r\naccident. He had neither wife nor child, and nobody had a better\r\nright to risk his neck. "We\'ll put a gag on \'im," said the groom,\r\n"and you\'ll ride \'im in a ring,--so that you may well-nigh break\r\nhis jaw; but he is a rum un, sir." "I\'ll do my best," said Phineas.\r\n"He\'ll take all that," said the groom. "Just let him have his own way\r\nat everything," said Lord Chiltern, as they moved away from the meet\r\nto Pickwell Gorse; "and if you\'ll only sit on his back, he\'ll carry\r\nyou through as safe as a church." Phineas could not help thinking\r\nthat the counsels of the master and of the groom were very different.\r\n"My idea is," continued Lord Chiltern, "that in hunting you should\r\nalways avoid a crowd. I don\'t think a horse is worth riding that\r\nwill go in a crowd. It\'s just like yachting,--you should have plenty\r\nof sea-room. If you\'re to pull your horse up at every fence till\r\nsomebody else is over, I think you\'d better come out on a donkey."\r\nAnd so they went away to Pickwell Gorse.\r\n\r\nThere were over two hundred men out, and Phineas began to think that\r\nit might not be so easy to get out of the crowd. A crowd in a fast\r\nrun no doubt quickly becomes small by degrees and beautifully less;\r\nbut it is very difficult, especially for a stranger, to free himself\r\nfrom the rush at the first start. Lord Chiltern\'s horse plunged about\r\nso violently, as they stood on a little hill-side looking down upon\r\nthe cover, that he was obliged to take him to a distance, and Phineas\r\nfollowed him. "If he breaks down wind," said Lord Chiltern, "we can\'t\r\nbe better than we are here. If he goes up wind, he must turn before\r\nlong, and we shall be all right." As he spoke an old hound opened\r\ntrue and sharp,--an old hound whom all the pack believed,--and in a\r\nmoment there was no doubt that the fox had been found. "There are not\r\nabove eight or nine acres in it," said Lord Chiltern, "and he can\'t\r\nhang long. Did you ever see such an uneasy brute as this in your\r\nlife? But I feel certain he\'ll go well when he gets away."\r\n\r\nPhineas was too much occupied with his own horse to think much of\r\nthat on which Lord Chiltern was mounted. Bonebreaker, the very moment\r\nthat he heard the old hound\'s note, stretched out his head, and put\r\nhis mouth upon the bit, and began to tremble in every muscle. "He\'s\r\na great deal more anxious for it than you and I are," said Lord\r\nChiltern. "I see they\'ve given you that gag. But don\'t you ride him\r\non it till he wants it. Give him lots of room, and he\'ll go in the\r\nsnaffle." All which caution made Phineas think that any insurance\r\noffice would charge very dear on his life at the present moment.\r\n\r\nThe fox took two rings of the gorse, and then he went,--up wind.\r\n"It\'s not a vixen, I\'ll swear," said Lord Chiltern. "A vixen in cub\r\nnever went away like that yet. Now then, Finn, my boy, keep to the\r\nright." And Lord Chiltern, with the horse out of Lincolnshire, went\r\naway across the brow of the hill, leaving the hounds to the left, and\r\nselected, as his point of exit into the next field, a stiff rail,\r\nwhich, had there been an accident, must have put a very wide margin\r\nof ground between the rider and his horse. "Go hard at your fences,\r\nand then you\'ll fall clear," he had said to Phineas. I don\'t think,\r\nhowever, that he would have ridden at the rail as he did, but\r\nthat there was no help for him. "The brute began in his own way,\r\nand carried on after in the same fashion all through," he said\r\nafterwards. Phineas took the fence a little lower down, and what\r\nit was at which he rode he never knew. Bonebreaker sailed over it,\r\nwhatever it was, and he soon found himself by his friend\'s side.\r\n\r\nThe ruck of the men were lower down than our two heroes, and there\r\nwere others far away to the left, and others, again, who had been at\r\nthe end of the gorse, and were now behind. Our friends were not near\r\nthe hounds, not within two fields of them, but the hounds were below\r\nthem, and therefore could be seen. "Don\'t be in a hurry, and they\'ll\r\nbe round upon us," Lord Chiltern said. "How the deuce is one to help\r\nbeing in a hurry?" said Phineas, who was doing his very best to ride\r\nBonebreaker with the snaffle, but had already began to feel that\r\nBonebreaker cared nothing for that weak instrument. "By George, I\r\nshould like to change with you," said Lord Chiltern. The Lincolnshire\r\nhorse was going along with his head very low, boring as he galloped,\r\nbut throwing his neck up at his fences, just when he ought to have\r\nkept himself steady. After this, though Phineas kept near Lord\r\nChiltern throughout the run, they were not again near enough to\r\nexchange words; and, indeed, they had but little breath for such\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nLord Chiltern rode still a little in advance, and Phineas, knowing\r\nhis friend\'s partiality for solitude when taking his fences, kept a\r\nlittle to his left. He began to find that Bonebreaker knew pretty\r\nwell what he was about. As for not using the gag rein, that was\r\nimpossible. When a horse puts out what strength he has against a\r\nman\'s arm, a man must put out what strength he has against the\r\nhorse\'s mouth. But Bonebreaker was cunning, and had had a gag rein\r\non before. He contracted his lip here, and bent out his jaw there,\r\ntill he had settled it to his mind, and then went away after his\r\nown fashion. He seemed to have a passion for smashing through big,\r\nhigh-grown ox-fences, and by degrees his rider came to feel that if\r\nthere was nothing worse coming, the fun was not bad.\r\n\r\nThe fox ran up wind for a couple of miles or so, as Lord Chiltern had\r\nprophesied, and then turned,--not to the right, as would best have\r\nserved him and Phineas, but to the left,--so that they were forced\r\nto make their way through the ruck of horses before they could place\r\nthemselves again. Phineas found himself crossing a road, in and out\r\nof it, before he knew where he was, and for a while he lost sight of\r\nLord Chiltern. But in truth he was leading now, whereas Lord Chiltern\r\nhad led before. The two horses having been together all the morning,\r\nand on the previous day, were willing enough to remain in company,\r\nif they were allowed to do so. They both crossed the road, not very\r\nfar from each other, going in and out amidst a crowd of horses, and\r\nbefore long were again placed well, now having the hunt on their\r\nright, whereas hitherto it had been on their left. They went over\r\nlarge pasture fields, and Phineas began to think that as long as\r\nBonebreaker would be able to go through the thick grown-up hedges,\r\nall would be right. Now and again he came to a cut fence, a fence\r\nthat had been cut and laid, and these were not so pleasant. Force\r\nwas not sufficient for them, and they admitted of a mistake. But the\r\nhorse, though he would rush at them unpleasantly, took them when they\r\ncame without touching them. It might be all right yet,--unless the\r\nbeast should tire with him; and then, Phineas thought, a misfortune\r\nmight probably occur. He remembered, as he flew over one such\r\nimpediment, that he rode a stone heavier than his friend. At the end\r\nof forty-five minutes Bonebreaker also might become aware of the\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nThe hounds were running well in sight to their right, and Phineas\r\nbegan to feel some of that pride which a man indulges when he becomes\r\naware that he has taken his place comfortably, has left the squad\r\nbehind, and is going well. There were men nearer the hounds than he\r\nwas, but he was near enough even for ambition. There had already been\r\nenough of the run to make him sure that it would be a "good thing",\r\nand enough to make him aware also that probably it might be too good.\r\nWhen a run is over, men are very apt to regret the termination, who\r\na minute or two before were anxiously longing that the hounds might\r\npull down their game. To finish well is everything in hunting. To\r\nhave led for over an hour is nothing, let the pace and country have\r\nbeen what they might, if you fall away during the last half mile.\r\nTherefore it is that those behind hope that the fox may make this\r\nor that cover, while the forward men long to see him turned over in\r\nevery field. To ride to hounds is very glorious; but to have ridden\r\nto hounds is more glorious still. They had now crossed another road,\r\nand a larger one, and had got into a somewhat closer country. The\r\nfields were not so big, and the fences were not so high. Phineas got\r\na moment to look about him, and saw Lord Chiltern riding without his\r\ncap. He was very red in the face, and his eyes seemed to glare, and\r\nhe was tugging at his horse with all his might. But the animal seemed\r\nstill to go with perfect command of strength, and Phineas had too\r\nmuch work on his own hands to think of offering Quixotic assistance\r\nto any one else. He saw some one, a farmer, as he thought, speak to\r\nLord Chiltern as they rode close together; but Chiltern only shook\r\nhis head and pulled at his horse.\r\n\r\nThere were brooks in those parts. The river Eye forms itself\r\nthereabouts, or some of its tributaries do so; and these tributaries,\r\nthough small as rivers, are considerable to men on one side who are\r\ncalled by the exigencies of the occasion to place themselves quickly\r\non the other. Phineas knew nothing of these brooks; but Bonebreaker\r\nhad gone gallantly over two, and now that there came a third in the\r\nway, it was to be hoped that he might go gallantly over that also.\r\nPhineas, at any rate, had no power to decide otherwise. As long as\r\nthe brute would go straight with him he could sit him; but he had\r\nlong given up the idea of having a will of his own. Indeed, till he\r\nwas within twenty yards of the brook, he did not see that it was\r\nlarger than the others. He looked around, and there was Chiltern\r\nclose to him, still fighting with his horse;--but the farmer had\r\nturned away. He thought that Chiltern nodded to him, as much as to\r\ntell him to go on. On he went at any rate. The brook, when he came to\r\nit, seemed to be a huge black hole, yawning beneath him. The banks\r\nwere quite steep, and just where he was to take off there was an\r\nugly stump. It was too late to think of anything. He stuck his knees\r\nagainst his saddle,--and in a moment was on the other side. The\r\nbrute, who had taken off a yard before the stump, knowing well the\r\ndanger of striking it with his foot, came down with a grunt, and did,\r\nI think, begin to feel the weight of that extra stone. Phineas, as\r\nsoon as he was safe, looked back, and there was Lord Chiltern\'s horse\r\nin the very act of his spring,--higher up the rivulet, where it was\r\neven broader. At that distance Phineas could see that Lord Chiltern\r\nwas wild with rage against the beast. But whether he wished to take\r\nthe leap or wished to avoid it, there was no choice left to him. The\r\nanimal rushed at the brook, and in a moment the horse and horseman\r\nwere lost to sight. It was well then that that extra stone should\r\ntell, as it enabled Phineas to arrest his horse and to come back to\r\nhis friend.\r\n\r\nThe Lincolnshire horse had chested the further bank, and of course\r\nhad fallen back into the stream. When Phineas got down he found that\r\nLord Chiltern was wedged in between the horse and the bank, which was\r\nbetter, at any rate, than being under the horse in the water. "All\r\nright, old fellow," he said, with a smile, when he saw Phineas. "You\r\ngo on; it\'s too good to lose." But he was very pale, and seemed to be\r\nquite helpless where he lay. The horse did not move,--and never did\r\nmove again. He had smashed his shoulder to pieces against a stump on\r\nthe bank, and was afterwards shot on that very spot.\r\n\r\nWhen Phineas got down he found that there was but little water where\r\nthe horse lay. The depth of the stream had been on the side from\r\nwhich they had taken off, and the thick black mud lay within a foot\r\nof the surface, close to the bank against which Lord Chiltern was\r\npropped. "That\'s the worst one I ever was on," said Lord Chiltern;\r\n"but I think he\'s gruelled now."\r\n\r\n"Are you hurt?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--I fancy there is something amiss. I can\'t move my arms; and I\r\ncatch my breath. My legs are all right if I could get away from this\r\naccursed brute."\r\n\r\n"I told you so," said the farmer, coming and looking down upon them\r\nfrom the bank. "I told you so, but you wouldn\'t be said." Then he too\r\ngot down, and between them both they extricated Lord Chiltern from\r\nhis position, and got him on to the bank.\r\n\r\n"That un\'s a dead un," said the farmer, pointing to the horse.\r\n\r\n"So much the better," said his lordship. "Give us a drop of sherry,\r\nFinn."\r\n\r\nHe had broken his collar-bone and three of his ribs. They got a\r\nfarmer\'s trap from Wissindine and took him into Oakham. When there,\r\nhe insisted on being taken on through Stamford to the Willingford\r\nBull before he would have his bones set,--picking up, however, a\r\nsurgeon at Stamford. Phineas remained with him for a couple of days,\r\nlosing his run with the Fitzwilliams and a day at the potted peas,\r\nand became very fond of his patient as he sat by his bedside.\r\n\r\n"That was a good run, though, wasn\'t it?" said Lord Chiltern\r\nas Phineas took his leave. "And, by George, Phineas, you rode\r\nBonebreaker so well, that you shall have him as often as you\'ll come\r\ndown. I don\'t know how it is, but you Irish fellows always ride."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nMr. Turnbull\'s Carriage Stops the Way\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Phineas got back to London, a day after his time, he found that\r\nthere was already a great political commotion in the metropolis.\r\nHe had known that on Easter Monday and Tuesday there was to be\r\na gathering of the people in favour of the ballot, and that on\r\nWednesday there was to be a procession with a petition which Mr.\r\nTurnbull was to receive from the hands of the people on Primrose\r\nHill. It had been at first intended that Mr. Turnbull should receive\r\nthe petition at the door of Westminster Hall on the Thursday; but he\r\nhad been requested by the Home Secretary to put aside this intention,\r\nand he had complied with the request made to him. Mr. Mildmay was\r\nto move the second reading of his Reform Bill on that day, the\r\npreliminary steps having been taken without any special notice; but\r\nthe bill of course included no clause in favour of the ballot; and\r\nthis petition was the consequence of that omission. Mr. Turnbull had\r\npredicted evil consequences, both in the House and out of it, and\r\nwas now doing the best in his power to bring about the verification\r\nof his own prophecies. Phineas, who reached his lodgings late on the\r\nThursday, found that the town had been in a state of ferment for\r\nthree days, that on the Wednesday forty or fifty thousand persons had\r\nbeen collected at Primrose Hill, and that the police had been forced\r\nto interfere,--and that worse was expected on the Friday. Though Mr.\r\nTurnbull had yielded to the Government as to receiving the petition,\r\nthe crowd was resolved that they would see the petition carried into\r\nthe House. It was argued that the Government would have done better\r\nto have refrained from interfering as to the previously intended\r\narrangement. It would have been easier to deal with a procession than\r\nwith a mob of men gathered together without any semblance of form.\r\nMr. Mildmay had been asked to postpone the second reading of his\r\nbill; but the request had come from his opponents, and he would\r\nnot yield to it. He said that it would be a bad expedient to close\r\nParliament from fear of the people. Phineas found at the Reform Club\r\non the Thursday evening that members of the House of Commons were\r\nrequested to enter on the Friday by the door usually used by the\r\npeers, and to make their way thence to their own House. He found that\r\nhis landlord, Mr. Bunce, had been out with the people during the\r\nentire three days;--and Mrs. Bunce, with a flood of tears, begged\r\nPhineas to interfere as to the Friday. "He\'s that headstrong that\r\nhe\'ll be took if anybody\'s took; and they say that all Westminster is\r\nto be lined with soldiers." Phineas on the Friday morning did have\r\nsome conversation with his landlord; but his first work on reaching\r\nLondon was to see Lord Chiltern\'s friends, and tell them of the\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nThe potted peas Committee sat on the Thursday, and he ought to have\r\nbeen there. His absence, however, was unavoidable, as he could not\r\nhave left his friend\'s bed-side so soon after the accident. On the\r\nWednesday he had written to Lady Laura, and on the Thursday evening\r\nhe went first to Portman Square and then to Grosvenor Place.\r\n\r\n"Of course he will kill himself some day," said the Earl,--with a\r\ntear, however, in each eye.\r\n\r\n"I hope not, my lord. He is a magnificent horseman; but accidents of\r\ncourse will happen."\r\n\r\n"How many of his bones are there not broken, I wonder?" said the\r\nfather. "It is useless to talk, of course. You think he is not in\r\ndanger?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not."\r\n\r\n"I should fear that he would be so liable to inflammation."\r\n\r\n"The doctor says that there is none. He has been taking an enormous\r\ndeal of exercise," said Phineas, "and drinking no wine. All that is\r\nin his favour."\r\n\r\n"What does he drink, then?" asked the Earl.\r\n\r\n"Nothing. I rather think, my lord, you are mistaken a little about\r\nhis habits. I don\'t fancy he ever drinks unless he is provoked to do\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Provoked! Could anything provoke you to make a brute of yourself?\r\nBut I am glad that he is in no danger. If you hear of him, let me\r\nknow how he goes on."\r\n\r\nLady Laura was of course full of concern. "I wanted to go down to\r\nhim," she said, "but Mr. Kennedy thought that there was no occasion."\r\n\r\n"Nor is there any;--I mean in regard to danger. He is very solitary\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"You must go to him again. Mr. Kennedy will not let me go unless I\r\ncan say that there is danger. He seems to think that because Oswald\r\nhas had accidents before, it is nothing. Of course I cannot leave\r\nLondon without his leave."\r\n\r\n"Your brother makes very little of it, you know."\r\n\r\n"Ah;--he would make little of anything. But if I were ill he would be\r\nin London by the first train."\r\n\r\n"Kennedy would let you go if you asked him."\r\n\r\n"But he advises me not to go. He says my duty does not require it,\r\nunless Oswald be in danger. Don\'t you know, Mr. Finn, how hard it is\r\nfor a wife not to take advice when it is so given?" This she said,\r\nwithin six months of her marriage, to the man who had been her\r\nhusband\'s rival!\r\n\r\nPhineas asked her whether Violet had heard the news, and learned that\r\nshe was still ignorant of it. "I got your letter only this morning,\r\nand I have not seen her," said Lady Laura. "Indeed, I am so angry\r\nwith her that I hardly wish to see her." Thursday was Lady Baldock\'s\r\nnight, and Phineas went from Grosvenor Place to Berkeley Square.\r\nThere he saw Violet, and found that she had heard of the accident.\r\n\r\n"I am so glad to see you, Mr. Finn," she said. "Do tell me;--is it\r\nmuch?"\r\n\r\n"Much in inconvenience, certainly; but not much in danger."\r\n\r\n"I think Laura was so unkind not to send me word! I only heard it\r\njust now. Did you see it?"\r\n\r\n"I was close to him, and helped him up. The horse jumped into a river\r\nwith him, and crushed him up against the bank."\r\n\r\n"How lucky that you should be there! Had you jumped the river?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--almost unintentionally, for my horse was rushing so that I\r\ncould not hold him. Chiltern was riding a brute that no one should\r\nhave ridden. No one will again."\r\n\r\n"Did he destroy himself?"\r\n\r\n"He had to be killed afterwards. He broke his shoulder."\r\n\r\n"How very lucky that you should have been near him,--and, again, how\r\nlucky that you should not have been hurt yourself!"\r\n\r\n"It was not likely that we should both come to grief at the same\r\nfence."\r\n\r\n"But it might have been you. And you think there is no danger?"\r\n\r\n"None whatever,--if I may believe the doctor. His hunting is done for\r\nthis year, and he will be very desolate. I shall go down again to him\r\nin a few days, and try to bring him up to town."\r\n\r\n"Do;--do. If he is laid up in his father\'s house, his father must\r\nsee him." Phineas had not looked at the matter in that light; but he\r\nthought that Miss Effingham might probably be right.\r\n\r\nEarly on the next morning he saw Mr. Bunce, and used all his\r\neloquence to keep that respectable member of society at home;--but\r\nin vain. "What good do you expect to do, Mr. Bunce?" he said, with\r\nperhaps some little tone of authority in his voice.\r\n\r\n"To carry my point," said Bunce.\r\n\r\n"And what is your point?"\r\n\r\n"My present point is the ballot, as a part of the Government\r\nmeasure."\r\n\r\n"And you expect to carry that by going out into the streets with all\r\nthe roughs of London, and putting yourself in direct opposition to\r\nthe authority of the magistrates? Do you really believe that the\r\nballot will become the law of the land any sooner because you incur\r\nthis danger and inconvenience?"\r\n\r\n"Look here, Mr. Finn; I don\'t believe the sea will become any fuller\r\nbecause the Piddle runs into it out of the Dorsetshire fields; but I\r\ndo believe that the waters from all the countries is what makes the\r\nocean. I shall help; and it\'s my duty to help."\r\n\r\n"It\'s your duty as a respectable citizen, with a wife and family, to\r\nstay at home."\r\n\r\n"If everybody with a wife and family was to say so, there\'d be\r\nnone there but roughs, and then where should we be? What would the\r\nGovernment people say to us then? If every man with a wife and family\r\nwas to show hisself in the streets to-night, we should have the\r\nballot before Parliament breaks up, and if none of \'em don\'t do it,\r\nwe shall never have the ballot. Ain\'t that so?" Phineas, who intended\r\nto be honest, was not prepared to dispute the assertion on the spur\r\nof the moment. "If that\'s so," said Bunce, triumphantly, "a man\'s\r\nduty\'s clear enough. He ought to go, though he\'d two wives and\r\nfamilies." And he went.\r\n\r\nThe petition was to be presented at six o\'clock, but the crowd, who\r\ncollected to see it carried into Westminster Hall, began to form\r\nitself by noon. It was said afterwards that many of the houses in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Palace Yard and the Bridge were filled with\r\nsoldiers; but if so, the men did not show themselves. In the course\r\nof the evening three or four companies of the Guards in St. James\'s\r\nPark did show themselves, and had some rough work to do, for many of\r\nthe people took themselves away from Westminster by that route. The\r\npolice, who were very numerous in Palace Yard, had a hard time of it\r\nall the afternoon, and it was said afterwards that it would have been\r\nmuch better to have allowed the petition to have been brought up by\r\nthe procession on Wednesday. A procession, let it be who it will that\r\nproceeds, has in it, of its own nature something of order. But now\r\nthere was no order. The petition, which was said to fill fifteen\r\ncabs,--though the absolute sheets of signatures were carried into\r\nthe House by four men,--was being dragged about half the day and it\r\ncertainly would have been impossible for a member to have made his\r\nway into the House through Westminster Hall between the hours of four\r\nand six. To effect an entrance at all they were obliged to go round\r\nat the back of the Abbey, as all the spaces round St. Margaret\'s\r\nChurch and Canning\'s monument were filled with the crowd. Parliament\r\nStreet was quite impassable at five o clock, and there was no traffic\r\nacross the bridge from that hour till after eight. As the evening\r\nwent on, the mob extended itself to Downing Street and the front\r\nof the Treasury Chambers, and before the night was over all the\r\nhoardings round the new Government offices had been pulled down. The\r\nwindows also of certain obnoxious members of Parliament were broken,\r\nwhen those obnoxious members lived within reach. One gentleman who\r\nunfortunately held a house in Richmond Terrace, and who was said\r\nto have said that the ballot was the resort of cowards, fared very\r\nbadly;--for his windows were not only broken, but his furniture and\r\nmirrors were destroyed by the stones that were thrown. Mr. Mildmay,\r\nI say, was much blamed. But after all, it may be a doubt whether the\r\nprocession on Wednesday might not have ended worse. Mr. Turnbull was\r\nheard to say afterwards that the number of people collected would\r\nhave been much greater.\r\n\r\nMr. Mildmay moved the second reading of his bill, and made his\r\nspeech. He made his speech with the knowledge that the Houses of\r\nParliament were surrounded by a mob, and I think that the fact added\r\nto its efficacy. It certainly gave him an appropriate opportunity\r\nfor a display which was not difficult. His voice faltered on two or\r\nthree occasions, and faltered through real feeling; but this sort of\r\nfeeling, though it be real, is at the command of orators on certain\r\noccasions, and does them yeoman\'s service. Mr. Mildmay was an\r\nold man, nearly worn out in the service of his country, who was\r\nknown to have been true and honest, and to have loved his country\r\nwell,--though there were of course they who declared that his\r\nhand had been too weak for power, and that his services had been\r\nnaught;--and on this evening his virtues were remembered. Once when\r\nhis voice failed him the whole House got up and cheered. The nature\r\nof a Whig Prime Minister\'s speech on such an occasion will be\r\nunderstood by most of my readers without further indication. The bill\r\nitself had been read before, and it was understood that no objection\r\nwould be made to the extent of the changes provided in it by the\r\nliberal side of the House. The opposition coming from liberal members\r\nwas to be confined to the subject of the ballot. And even as yet\r\nit was not known whether Mr. Turnbull and his followers would vote\r\nagainst the second reading, or whether they would take what was\r\ngiven, and declare their intention of obtaining the remainder on a\r\nseparate motion. The opposition of a large party of Conservatives was\r\na matter of certainty; but to this party Mr. Mildmay did not conceive\r\nhimself bound to offer so large an amount of argument as he would\r\nhave given had there been at the moment no crowd in Palace Yard. And\r\nhe probably felt that that crowd would assist him with his old Tory\r\nenemies. When, in the last words of his speech, he declared that\r\nunder no circumstances would he disfigure the close of his political\r\ncareer by voting for the ballot,--not though the people, on whose\r\nbehalf he had been fighting battles all his life, should be there in\r\nany number to coerce him,--there came another round of applause from\r\nthe opposition benches, and Mr. Daubeny began to fear that some young\r\nhorses in his team might get loose from their traces. With great\r\ndignity Mr. Daubeny had kept aloof from Mr. Turnbull and from Mr.\r\nTurnbull\'s tactics; but he was not the less alive to the fact\r\nthat Mr. Turnbull, with his mob and his big petition, might be of\r\nconsiderable assistance to him in this present duel between himself\r\nand Mr. Mildmay. I think Mr. Daubeny was in the habit of looking at\r\nthese contests as duels between himself and the leader on the other\r\nside of the House,--in which assistance from any quarter might be\r\naccepted if offered.\r\n\r\nMr. Mildmay\'s speech did not occupy much over an hour, and at\r\nhalf-past seven Mr. Turnbull got up to reply. It was presumed that he\r\nwould do so, and not a member left his place, though that time of the\r\nday is an interesting time, and though Mr. Turnbull was accustomed to\r\nbe long. There soon came to be but little ground for doubting what\r\nwould be the nature of Mr. Turnbull\'s vote on the second reading.\r\n"How may I dare," said he, "to accept so small a measure of reform as\r\nthis with such a message from the country as is now conveyed to me\r\nthrough the presence of fifty thousand of my countrymen, who are at\r\nthis moment demanding their measure of reform just beyond the frail\r\nwalls of this chamber? The right honourable gentleman has told us\r\nthat he will never be intimidated by a concourse of people. I do not\r\nknow that there was any need that he should speak of intimidation.\r\nNo one has accused the right honourable gentleman of political\r\ncowardice. But, as he has so said, I will follow in his footsteps.\r\nNeither will I be intimidated by the large majority which this House\r\npresented the other night against the wishes of the people. I will\r\nsupport no great measure of reform which does not include the ballot\r\namong its clauses." And so Mr. Turnbull threw down the gauntlet.\r\n\r\nMr. Turnbull spoke for two hours, and then the debate was adjourned\r\ntill the Monday. The adjournment was moved by an independent member,\r\nwho, as was known, would support the Government, and at once received\r\nMr. Turnbull\'s assent. There was no great hurry with the bill, and\r\nit was felt that it would be well to let the ferment subside. Enough\r\nhad been done for glory when Mr. Mildmay moved the second reading,\r\nand quite enough in the way of debate,--with such an audience almost\r\nwithin hearing,--when Mr. Turnbull\'s speech had been made. Then the\r\nHouse emptied itself at once. The elderly, cautious members made\r\ntheir exit through the peers\' door. The younger men got out into\r\nthe crowd through Westminster Hall, and were pushed about among the\r\nroughs for an hour or so. Phineas, who made his way through the hall\r\nwith Laurence Fitzgibbon, found Mr. Turnbull\'s carriage waiting at\r\nthe entrance with a dozen policemen round it.\r\n\r\n"I hope he won\'t get home to dinner before midnight," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"He understands all about it," said Laurence. "He had a good meal at\r\nthree, before he left home, and you\'d find sandwiches and sherry in\r\nplenty if you were to search his carriage. He knows how to remedy the\r\ncosts of mob popularity."\r\n\r\nAt that time poor Bunce was being hustled about in the crowd in the\r\nvicinity of Mr. Turnbull\'s carriage. Phineas and Fitzgibbon made\r\ntheir way out, and by degrees worked a passage for themselves into\r\nParliament Street. Mr. Turnbull had been somewhat behind them in\r\ncoming down the hall, and had not been without a sense of enjoyment\r\nin the ovation which was being given to him. There can be no doubt\r\nthat he was wrong in what he was doing. That affair of the carriage\r\nwas altogether wrong, and did Mr. Turnbull much harm for many a day\r\nafterwards. When he got outside the door, where were the twelve\r\npolicemen guarding his carriage, a great number of his admirers\r\nendeavoured to shake hands with him. Among them was the devoted\r\nBunce. But the policemen seemed to think that Mr. Turnbull was to be\r\nguarded, even from the affection of his friends, and were as careful\r\nthat he should be ushered into his carriage untouched, as though he\r\nhad been the favourite object of political aversion for the moment.\r\nMr. Turnbull himself, when he began to perceive that men were\r\ncrowding close upon the gates, and to hear the noise, and to feel, as\r\nit were, the breath of the mob, stepped on quickly into his carriage.\r\nHe said a word or two in a loud voice. "Thank you, my friends. I\r\ntrust you may obtain all your just demands." But he did not pause\r\nto speak. Indeed, he could hardly have done so, as the policemen\r\nwere manifestly in a hurry. The carriage was got away at a snail\'s\r\npace;--but there remained in the spot where the carriage had stood\r\nthe makings of a very pretty street row.\r\n\r\nBunce had striven hard to shake hands with his hero,--Bunce and some\r\nother reformers as ardent and as decent as himself. The police were\r\nvery determinate that there should be no such interruption to their\r\nprogramme for getting Mr. Turnbull off the scene. Mr. Bunce, who had\r\nhis own ideas as to his right to shake hands with any gentleman at\r\nWestminster Hall who might choose to shake hands with him, became\r\nuneasy under the impediments that were placed in his way, and\r\nexpressed himself warmly as to his civil rights. Now a London\r\npoliceman in a political row is, I believe, the most forbearing\r\nof men. So long as he meets with no special political opposition,\r\nordinary ill-usage does not even put him out of temper. He is paid\r\nfor rough work among roughs, and takes his rubs gallantly. But he\r\nfeels himself to be an instrument for the moment of despotic power\r\nas opposed to civil rights, and he won\'t stand what he calls "jaw."\r\nTrip up a policeman in such a scramble, and he will take it in good\r\nspirit; but mention the words "Habeas Corpus," and he\'ll lock you up\r\nif he can. As a rule, his instincts are right; for the man who talks\r\nabout "Habeas Corpus" in a political crowd will generally do more\r\nharm than can be effected by the tripping up of any constable. But\r\nthese instincts may be the means of individual injustice. I think\r\nthey were so when Mr. Bunce was arrested and kept a fast prisoner.\r\nHis wife had shown her knowledge of his character when she declared\r\nthat he\'d be "took" if any one was "took."\r\n\r\nBunce was taken into custody with some three or four others like\r\nhimself,--decent men, who meant no harm, but who thought that as men\r\nthey were bound to show their political opinions, perhaps at the\r\nexpense of a little martyrdom,--and was carried into a temporary\r\nstronghold, which had been provided for the necessities of the\r\npolice, under the clock-tower.\r\n\r\n"Keep me, at your peril!" said Bunce, indignantly.\r\n\r\n"We means it," said the sergeant who had him in custody.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve done no ha\'porth to break the law," said Bunce.\r\n\r\n"You was breaking the law when you was upsetting my men, as I saw\r\nyou," said the sergeant.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve upset nobody," said Bunce.\r\n\r\n"Very well," rejoined the sergeant; "you can say it all before the\r\nmagistrate, to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"And am I to be locked up all night?" said Bunce.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid you will," replied the sergeant.\r\n\r\nBunce, who was not by nature a very talkative man, said no more; but\r\nhe swore in his heart that there should be vengeance. Between eleven\r\nand twelve he was taken to the regular police-station, and from\r\nthence he was enabled to send word to his wife.\r\n\r\n"Bunce has been taken," said she, with something of the tragic queen,\r\nand something also of the injured wife in the tone of her voice, as\r\nsoon as Phineas let himself in with the latchkey between twelve and\r\none. And then, mingled with, and at last dominant over, those severer\r\ntones, came the voice of the loving woman whose beloved one was in\r\ntrouble. "I knew how it\'d be, Mr. Finn. Didn\'t I? And what must we\r\ndo? I don\'t suppose he\'d had a bit to eat from the moment he went\r\nout;--and as for a drop of beer, he never thinks of it, except what\r\nI puts down for him at his meals. Them nasty police always take the\r\nbest. That\'s why I was so afeard."\r\n\r\nPhineas said all that he could to comfort her, and promised to go\r\nto the police-office early in the morning and look after Bunce. No\r\nserious evil would, he thought, probably come of it; but still Bunce\r\nhad been wrong to go.\r\n\r\n"But you might have been took yourself," argued Mrs. Bunce, "just as\r\nwell as he." Then Phineas explained that he had gone forth in the\r\nexecution of a public duty. "You might have been took, all the same,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Bunce, "for I\'m sure Bunce didn\'t do nothing amiss."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n"The First Speech"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, which was Saturday, Phineas was early at\r\nthe police-office at Westminster looking after the interests of his\r\nlandlord; but there had been a considerable number of men taken up\r\nduring the row, and our friend could hardly procure that attention\r\nfor Mr. Bunce\'s case to which he thought the decency of his client\r\nand his own position as a member of Parliament were entitled. The men\r\nwho had been taken up were taken in batches before the magistrates;\r\nbut as the soldiers in the park had been maltreated, and a\r\nconsiderable injury had been done in the neighbourhood of Downing\r\nStreet, there was a good deal of strong feeling against the mob, and\r\nthe magistrates were disposed to be severe. If decent men chose to go\r\nout among such companions, and thereby get into trouble, decent men\r\nmust take the consequences. During the Saturday and Sunday a very\r\nstrong feeling grew up against Mr. Turnbull. The story of the\r\ncarriage was told, and he was declared to be a turbulent demagogue,\r\nonly desirous of getting popularity. And together with this feeling\r\nthere arose a general verdict of "Serve them right" against all who\r\nhad come into contact with the police in the great Turnbull row; and\r\nthus it came to pass that Mr. Bunce had not been liberated up to\r\nthe Monday morning. On the Sunday Mrs. Bunce was in hysterics, and\r\ndeclared her conviction that Mr. Bunce would be imprisoned for life.\r\nPoor Phineas had an unquiet time with her on the morning of that day.\r\nIn every ecstasy of her grief she threw herself into his arms, either\r\nmetaphorically or materially, according to the excess of her agony at\r\nthe moment, and expressed repeatedly an assured conviction that all\r\nher children would die of starvation, and that she herself would be\r\npicked up under the arches of one of the bridges. Phineas, who was\r\nsoft-hearted, did what he could to comfort her, and allowed himself\r\nto be worked up to strong parliamentary anger against the magistrates\r\nand police. "When they think that they have public opinion on their\r\nside, there is nothing in the way or arbitrary excess which is too\r\ngreat for them." This he said to Barrington Erle, who angered him and\r\nincreased the warmth of his feeling by declaring that a little close\r\nconfinement would be good for the Bunces of the day. "If we don\'t\r\nkeep the mob down, the mob will keep us down," said the Whig private\r\nsecretary. Phineas had no opportunity of answering this, but declared\r\nto himself that Barrington Erle was no more a Liberal at heart than\r\nwas Mr. Daubeny. "He was born on that side of the question, and has\r\nbeen receiving Whig wages all his life. That is the history of his\r\npolitics!"\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday afternoon Phineas went to Lord Brentford\'s in Portman\r\nSquare, intending to say a word or two about Lord Chiltern, and\r\nmeaning also to induce, if possible, the Cabinet Minister to take\r\npart with him against the magistrates,--having a hope also, in which\r\nhe was not disappointed, that he might find Lady Laura Kennedy with\r\nher father. He had come to understand that Lady Laura was not to be\r\nvisited at her own house on Sundays. So much indeed she had told\r\nhim in so many words. But he had come to understand also, without\r\nany plain telling, that she rebelled in heart against this Sabbath\r\ntyranny,--and that she would escape from it when escape was possible.\r\nShe had now come to talk to her father about her brother, and had\r\nbrought Violet Effingham with her. They had walked together across\r\nthe park after church, and intended to walk back again. Mr. Kennedy\r\ndid not like to have any carriage out on a Sunday, and to this\r\narrangement his wife made no objection.\r\n\r\nPhineas had received a letter from the Stamford surgeon, and was able\r\nto report favourably of Lord Chiltern. "The man says that he had\r\nbetter not be moved for a month," said Phineas. "But that means\r\nnothing. They always say that."\r\n\r\n"Will it not be best for him to remain where he is?" said the Earl.\r\n\r\n"He has not a soul to speak to," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"I wish I were with him," said his sister.\r\n\r\n"That is, of course, out of the question," said the Earl. "They know\r\nhim at that inn, and it really seems to me best that he should stay\r\nthere. I do not think he would be so much at his ease here."\r\n\r\n"It must be dreadful for a man to be confined to his room without\r\na creature near him, except the servants," said Violet. The Earl\r\nfrowned, but said nothing further. They all perceived that as soon as\r\nhe had learned that there was no real danger as to his son\'s life, he\r\nwas determined that this accident should not work him up to any show\r\nof tenderness. "I do so hope he will come up to London," continued\r\nViolet, who was not afraid of the Earl, and was determined not to be\r\nput down.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know what you are talking about, my dear," said Lord\r\nBrentford.\r\n\r\nAfter this Phineas found it very difficult to extract any sympathy\r\nfrom the Earl on behalf of the men who had been locked up. He was\r\nmoody and cross, and could not be induced to talk on the great\r\nsubject of the day. Violet Effingham declared that she did not care\r\nhow many Bunces were locked up; nor for how long,--adding, however,\r\na wish that Mr. Turnbull himself had been among the number of the\r\nprisoners. Lady Laura was somewhat softer than this, and consented to\r\nexpress pity in the case of Mr. Bunce himself; but Phineas perceived\r\nthat the pity was awarded to him and not to the sufferer. The feeling\r\nagainst Mr. Turnbull was at the present moment so strong among all\r\nthe upper classes, that Mr. Bunce and his brethren might have been\r\nkept in durance for a week without commiseration from them.\r\n\r\n"It is very hard certainly on a man like Mr. Bunce," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"Why did not Mr. Bunce stay at home and mind his business?" said the\r\nEarl.\r\n\r\nPhineas spent the remainder of that day alone, and came to a\r\nresolution that on the coming occasion he certainly would speak in\r\nthe House. The debate would be resumed on the Monday, and he would\r\nrise to his legs on the very first moment that it became possible\r\nfor him to do so. And he would do nothing towards preparing a\r\nspeech;--nothing whatever. On this occasion he would trust entirely\r\nto such words as might come to him at the moment;--ay, and to such\r\nthoughts. He had before burdened his memory with preparations, and\r\nthe very weight of the burden had been too much for his mind. He had\r\nfeared to trust himself to speak, because he had felt that he was\r\nnot capable of performing the double labour of saying his lesson\r\nby heart, and of facing the House for the first time. There should\r\nbe nothing now for him to remember. His thoughts were full of his\r\nsubject. He would support Mr. Mildmay\'s bill with all his eloquence,\r\nbut he would implore Mr. Mildmay, and the Home Secretary, and the\r\nGovernment generally, to abstain from animosity against the populace\r\nof London, because they desired one special boon which Mr. Mildmay\r\ndid not think that it was his duty to give them. He hoped that ideas\r\nand words would come to him. Ideas and words had been free enough\r\nwith him in the old days of the Dublin debating society. If they\r\nfailed him now, he must give the thing up, and go back to Mr. Low.\r\n\r\nOn the Monday morning Phineas was for two hours at the police-court\r\nin Westminster, and at about one on that day Mr. Bunce was liberated.\r\nWhen he was brought up before the magistrate, Mr. Bunce spoke his\r\nmind very freely as to the usage he had received, and declared his\r\nintention of bringing an action against the sergeant who had detained\r\nhim. The magistrate, of course, took the part of the police, and\r\ndeclared that, from the evidence of two men who were examined, Bunce\r\nhad certainly used such violence in the crowd as had justified his\r\narrest.\r\n\r\n"I used no violence," said Bunce.\r\n\r\n"According to your own showing, you endeavoured to make your way up\r\nto Mr. Turnbull\'s carriage," said the magistrate.\r\n\r\n"I was close to the carriage before the police even saw me," said\r\nBunce.\r\n\r\n"But you tried to force your way round to the door."\r\n\r\n"I used no force till a man had me by the collar to push me back; and\r\nI wasn\'t violent, not then. I told him I was doing what I had a right\r\nto do,--and it was that as made him hang on to me."\r\n\r\n"You were not doing what you had a right to do. You were assisting to\r\ncreate a riot," said the magistrate, with that indignation which a\r\nLondon magistrate should always know how to affect.\r\n\r\nPhineas, however, was allowed to give evidence as to his landlord\'s\r\ncharacter, and then Bunce was liberated. But before he went he\r\nagain swore that that should not be the last of it, and he told the\r\nmagistrate that he had been ill-used. When liberated, he was joined\r\nby a dozen sympathising friends, who escorted him home, and among\r\nthem were one or two literary gentlemen, employed on those excellent\r\npenny papers, the _People\'s Banner_ and the _Ballot-box_. It was\r\ntheir intention that Mr. Bunce\'s case should not be allowed to sleep.\r\nOne of these gentlemen made a distinct offer to Phineas Finn of\r\nunbounded popularity during life and of immortality afterwards,\r\nif he, as a member of Parliament, would take up Bunce\'s case with\r\nvigour. Phineas, not quite understanding the nature of the offer, and\r\nnot as yet knowing the profession of the gentleman, gave some general\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n"You come out strong, Mr. Finn, and we\'ll see that you are properly\r\nreported. I\'m on the _Banner_, sir, and I\'ll answer for that."\r\n\r\nPhineas, who had been somewhat eager in expressing his sympathy\r\nwith Bunce, and had not given very close attention to the gentleman\r\nwho was addressing him, was still in the dark. The nature of the\r\n_Banner_, which the gentleman was on, did not at once come home to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Something ought to be done, certainly," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"We shall take it up strong," said the gentleman, "and we shall be\r\nhappy to have you among us. You\'ll find, Mr. Finn, that in public\r\nlife there\'s nothing like having a horgan to back you. What is the\r\nmost you can do in the \'Ouse? Nothing, if you\'re not reported. You\'re\r\nspeaking to the country;--ain\'t you? And you can\'t do that without a\r\nhorgan, Mr. Finn. You come among us on the _Banner_, Mr. Finn. You\r\ncan\'t do better."\r\n\r\nThen Phineas understood the nature of the offer made to him. As they\r\nparted, the literary gentleman gave our hero his card. "Mr. Quintus\r\nSlide." So much was printed. Then, on the corner of the card was\r\nwritten, "_Banner_ Office, 137, Fetter Lane." Mr. Quintus Slide\r\nwas a young man, under thirty, not remarkable for clean linen, and\r\nwho always talked of the "\'Ouse." But he was a well-known and not\r\nundistinguished member of a powerful class of men. He had been a\r\nreporter, and as such knew the "\'Ouse" well, and was a writer for the\r\npress. And, though he talked of "\'Ouses" and "horgans", he wrote good\r\nEnglish with great rapidity, and was possessed of that special sort\r\nof political fervour which shows itself in a man\'s work rather than\r\nin his conduct. It was Mr. Slide\'s taste to be an advanced reformer,\r\nand in all his operations on behalf of the _People\'s Banner_ he\r\nwas a reformer very much advanced. No man could do an article on the\r\npeople\'s indefeasible rights with more pronounced vigour than Mr.\r\nSlide. But it had never occurred to him as yet that he ought to care\r\nfor anything else than the fight,--than the advantage of having a\r\ngood subject on which to write slashing articles. Mr. Slide was an\r\nenergetic but not a thoughtful man; but in his thoughts on politics,\r\nas far as they went with him, he regarded the wrongs of the people as\r\nbeing of infinitely greater value than their rights. It was not that\r\nhe was insincere in all that he was daily saying;--but simply that\r\nhe never thought about it. Very early in life he had fallen among\r\n"people\'s friends," and an opening on the liberal press had come in\r\nhis way. To be a "people\'s friend" suited the turn of his ambition,\r\nand he was a "people\'s friend." It was his business to abuse\r\nGovernment, and to express on all occasions an opinion that as a\r\nmatter of course the ruling powers were the "people\'s enemies." Had\r\nthe ruling powers ceased to be the "people\'s enemies," Mr. Slide\'s\r\nground would have been taken from under his feet. But such a\r\ncatastrophe was out of the question. That excellent old arrangement\r\nthat had gone on since demagogues were first invented was in\r\nfull vigour. There were the ruling powers and there were the\r\npeople,--devils on one side and angels on the other,--and as long\r\nas a people\'s friend had a pen in his hand all was right.\r\n\r\nPhineas, when he left the indignant Bunce to go among his friends,\r\nwalked to the House thinking a good deal of what Mr. Slide had said\r\nto him. The potted peas Committee was again on, and he had intended\r\nto be in the Committee Room by twelve punctually: but he had been\r\nunable to leave Mr. Bunce in the lurch, and it was now past one.\r\nIndeed, he had, from one unfortunate circumstance after another,\r\nfailed hitherto in giving to the potted peas that resolute attention\r\nwhich the subject demanded. On the present occasion his mind was full\r\nof Mr. Quintus Slide and the _People\'s Banner_. After all, was there\r\nnot something in Mr. Slide\'s proposition? He, Phineas, had come into\r\nParliament as it were under the wing of a Government pack, and his\r\nfriendships, which had been very successful, had been made with\r\nMinisters, and with the friends of Ministers. He had made up his mind\r\nto be Whig Ministerial, and to look for his profession in that line.\r\nHe had been specially fortified in this resolution by his dislike\r\nto the ballot,--which dislike had been the result of Mr. Monk\'s\r\nteaching. Had Mr. Turnbull become his friend instead, it may well be\r\nthat he would have liked the ballot. On such subjects men must think\r\nlong, and be sure that they have thought in earnest, before they are\r\njustified in saying that their opinions are the results of their\r\nown thoughts. But now he began to reflect how far this ministerial\r\nprofession would suit him. Would it be much to be a Lord of the\r\nTreasury, subject to the dominion of Mr. Ratler? Such lordship and\r\nsuch subjection would be the result of success. He told himself\r\nthat he was at heart a true Liberal. Would it not be better for him\r\nto abandon the idea of office trammels, and go among them on the\r\n_People\'s Banner_? A glow of enthusiasm came over him as he thought\r\nof it. But what would Violet Effingham say to the _People\'s Banner_\r\nand Mr. Quintus Slide? And he would have liked the _Banner_ better\r\nhad not Mr. Slide talked about the \'Ouse.\r\n\r\nFrom the Committee Room, in which, alas! he took no active part in\r\nreference to the potted peas, he went down to the House, and was\r\npresent when the debate was resumed. Not unnaturally, one speaker\r\nafter another made some allusion to the row in the streets, and the\r\nwork which had fallen to the lot of the magistrates. Mr. Turnbull\r\nhad declared that he would vote against the second reading of Mr.\r\nMildmay\'s bill, and had explained that he would do so because he\r\ncould consent to no Reform Bill which did not include the ballot as\r\none of its measures. The debate fashioned itself after this speech of\r\nMr. Turnbull\'s, and turned again very much upon the ballot,--although\r\nit had been thought that the late debate had settled that question.\r\nOne or two of Mr. Turnbull\'s followers declared that they also would\r\nvote against the bill,--of course, as not going far enough; and one\r\nor two gentlemen from the Conservative benches extended a spoken\r\nwelcome to these new colleagues. Then Mr. Palliser got up and\r\naddressed the House for an hour, struggling hard to bring back the\r\nreal subject, and to make the House understand that the ballot,\r\nwhether good or bad, had been knocked on the head, and that members\r\nhad no right at the present moment to consider anything but the\r\nexpediency or inexpediency of so much Reform as Mr. Mildmay presented\r\nto them in the present bill.\r\n\r\nPhineas was determined to speak, and to speak on this evening if he\r\ncould catch the Speaker\'s eye. Again the scene before him was going\r\nround before him; again things became dim, and again he felt his\r\nblood beating hard at his heart. But things were not so bad with\r\nhim as they had been before, because he had nothing to remember. He\r\nhardly knew, indeed, what he intended to say. He had an idea that he\r\nwas desirous of joining in earnest support of the measure, with a\r\nvehement protest against the injustice which had been done to the\r\npeople in general, and to Mr. Bunce in particular. He had firmly\r\nresolved that no fear of losing favour with the Government should\r\ninduce him to hold his tongue as to the Buncean cruelties. Sooner\r\nthan do so he would certainly "go among them" at the _Banner_ office.\r\n\r\nHe started up, wildly, when Mr. Palliser had completed his speech;\r\nbut the Speaker\'s eye, not unnaturally, had travelled to the other\r\nside of the House, and there was a Tory of the old school upon his\r\nlegs,--Mr. Western, the member for East Barsetshire, one of the\r\ngallant few who dared to vote against Sir Robert Peel\'s bill for\r\nrepealing the Corn Laws in 1846. Mr. Western spoke with a slow,\r\nponderous, unimpressive, but very audible voice, for some twenty\r\nminutes, disdaining to make reference to Mr. Turnbull and his\r\npolitics, but pleading against any Reform, with all the old\r\narguments. Phineas did not hear a word that he said;--did not attempt\r\nto hear. He was keen in his resolution to make another attempt at the\r\nSpeaker\'s eye, and at the present moment was thinking of that, and\r\nof that only. He did not even give himself a moment\'s reflection as\r\nto what his own speech should be. He would dash at it and take his\r\nchance, resolved that at least he would not fail in courage. Twice he\r\nwas on his legs before Mr. Western had finished his slow harangue,\r\nand twice he was compelled to reseat himself,--thinking that he had\r\nsubjected himself to ridicule. At last the member for East Barset sat\r\ndown, and Phineas was conscious that he had lost a moment or two in\r\npresenting himself again to the Speaker.\r\n\r\nHe held his ground, however, though he saw that he had various rivals\r\nfor the right of speech. He held his ground, and was instantly aware\r\nthat he had gained his point. There was a slight pause, and as\r\nsome other urgent member did not reseat himself, Phineas heard the\r\npresident of that august assembly call upon himself to address the\r\nHouse. The thing was now to be done. There he was with the House of\r\nCommons at his feet,--a crowded House, bound to be his auditors as\r\nlong as he should think fit to address them, and reporters by tens\r\nand twenties in the gallery ready and eager to let the country know\r\nwhat the young member for Loughshane would say in this his maiden\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nPhineas Finn had sundry gifts, a powerful and pleasant voice, which\r\nhe had learned to modulate, a handsome presence, and a certain\r\nnatural mixture of modesty and self-reliance, which would certainly\r\nprotect him from the faults of arrogance and pomposity, and which,\r\nperhaps, might carry him through the perils of his new position. And\r\nhe had also the great advantage of friends in the House who were\r\nanxious that he should do well. But he had not that gift of slow\r\nblood which on the former occasion would have enabled him to remember\r\nhis prepared speech, and which would now have placed all his own\r\nresources within his own reach. He began with the expression of an\r\nopinion that every true reformer ought to accept Mr. Mildmay\'s bill,\r\neven if it were accepted only as an instalment,--but before he had\r\ngot through these sentences, he became painfully conscious that he\r\nwas repeating his own words.\r\n\r\nHe was cheered almost from the outset, and yet he knew as he went\r\non that he was failing. He had certain arguments at his fingers\'\r\nends,--points with which he was, in truth, so familiar that he need\r\nhardly have troubled himself to arrange them for special use,--and he\r\nforgot even these. He found that he was going on with one platitude\r\nafter another as to the benefit of reform, in a manner that would\r\nhave shamed him six or seven years ago at a debating club. He pressed\r\non, fearing that words would fail him altogether if he paused;--but\r\nhe did in truth speak very much too fast, knocking his words together\r\nso that no reporter could properly catch them. But he had nothing to\r\nsay for the bill except what hundreds had said before, and hundreds\r\nwould say again. Still he was cheered, and still he went on; and as\r\nhe became more and more conscious of his failure there grew upon him\r\nthe idea,--the dangerous hope, that he might still save himself from\r\nignominy by the eloquence of his invective against the police.\r\n\r\nHe tried it, and succeeded thoroughly in making the House understand\r\nthat he was very angry,--but he succeeded in nothing else. He could\r\nnot catch the words to express the thoughts of his mind. He could not\r\nexplain his idea that the people out of the House had as much right\r\nto express their opinion in favour of the ballot as members in the\r\nHouse had to express theirs against it; and that animosity had been\r\nshown to the people by the authorities because they had so expressed\r\ntheir opinion. Then he attempted to tell the story of Mr. Bunce in a\r\nlight and airy way, failed, and sat down in the middle of it. Again\r\nhe was cheered by all around him,--cheered as a new member is usually\r\ncheered,--and in the midst of the cheer would have blown out his\r\nbrains had there been a pistol there ready for such an operation.\r\n\r\nThat hour with him was very bad. He did not know how to get up and\r\ngo away, or how to keep his place. For some time he sat with his\r\nhat off, forgetful of his privilege of wearing it; and then put it\r\non hurriedly, as though the fact of his not wearing it must have\r\nbeen observed by everybody. At last, at about two, the debate was\r\nadjourned, and then as he was slowly leaving the House, thinking how\r\nhe might creep away without companionship, Mr. Monk took him by the\r\narm.\r\n\r\n"Are you going to walk?" said Mr. Monk.\r\n\r\n"Yes", said Phineas; "I shall walk."\r\n\r\n"Then we may go together as far as Pall Mall. Come along." Phineas\r\nhad no means of escape, and left the House hanging on Mr. Monk\'s arm,\r\nwithout a word. Nor did Mr. Monk speak till they were out in Palace\r\nYard. "It was not much amiss," said Mr. Monk; "but you\'ll do better\r\nthan that yet."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Monk," said Phineas, "I have made an ass of myself so\r\nthoroughly, that there will at any rate be this good result, that I\r\nshall never make an ass of myself again after the same fashion."\r\n\r\n"Ah!--I thought you had some such feeling as that, and therefore I\r\nwas determined to speak to you. You may be sure, Finn, that I do not\r\ncare to flatter you, and I think you ought to know that, as far as I\r\nam able, I will tell you the truth. Your speech, which was certainly\r\nnothing great, was about on a par with other maiden speeches in the\r\nHouse of Commons. You have done yourself neither good nor harm. Nor\r\nwas it desirable that you should. My advice to you now is, never to\r\navoid speaking on any subject that interests you, but never to speak\r\nfor above three minutes till you find yourself as much at home on\r\nyour legs as you are when sitting. But do not suppose that you have\r\nmade an ass of yourself,--that is, in any special degree. Now,\r\ngood-night."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nPhineas Discussed\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Laura Kennedy heard two accounts of her friend\'s speech,--and\r\nboth from men who had been present. Her husband was in his place, in\r\naccordance with his constant practice, and Lord Brentford had been\r\nseated, perhaps unfortunately, in the peers\' gallery.\r\n\r\n"And you think it was a failure?" Lady Laura said to her husband.\r\n\r\n"It certainly was not a success. There was nothing particular about\r\nit. There was a good deal of it you could hardly hear."\r\n\r\nAfter that she got the morning newspapers, and turned with great\r\ninterest to the report. Phineas Finn had been, as it were, adopted by\r\nher as her own political offspring,--or at any rate as her political\r\ngodchild. She had made promises on his behalf to various personages\r\nof high political standing,--to her father, to Mr. Monk, to the Duke\r\nof St. Bungay, and even to Mr. Mildmay himself. She had thoroughly\r\nintended that Phineas Finn should be a political success from the\r\nfirst; and since her marriage, she had, I think, been more intent\r\nupon it than before. Perhaps there was a feeling on her part that\r\nhaving wronged him in one way, she would repay him in another. She\r\nhad become so eager for his success,--for a while scorning to conceal\r\nher feeling,--that her husband had unconsciously begun to entertain\r\na dislike to her eagerness. We know how quickly women arrive at an\r\nunderstanding of the feelings of those with whom they live; and now,\r\non that very occasion, Lady Laura perceived that her husband did not\r\ntake in good part her anxiety on behalf of her friend. She saw that\r\nit was so as she turned over the newspaper looking for the report of\r\nthe speech. It was given in six lines, and at the end of it there was\r\nan intimation,--expressed in the shape of advice,--that the young\r\norator had better speak more slowly if he wished to be efficacious\r\neither with the House or with the country.\r\n\r\n"He seems to have been cheered a good deal," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"All members are cheered at their first speech," said Mr. Kennedy.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no doubt he\'ll do well yet," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"Very likely," said Mr. Kennedy. Then he turned to his newspaper, and\r\ndid not take his eyes off it as long as his wife remained with him.\r\n\r\nLater in the day Lady Laura saw her father, and Miss Effingham was\r\nwith her at the time. Lord Brentford said something which indicated\r\nthat he had heard the debate on the previous evening, and Lady Laura\r\ninstantly began to ask him about Phineas.\r\n\r\n"The less said the better," was the Earl\'s reply.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that it was so bad as that?" asked Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"It was not very bad at first;--though indeed nobody could say it was\r\nvery good. But he got himself into a mess about the police and the\r\nmagistrates before he had done, and nothing but the kindly feeling\r\nalways shown to a first effort saved him from being coughed down."\r\nLady Laura had not a word more to say about Phineas to her father;\r\nbut, womanlike, she resolved that she would not abandon him. How\r\nmany first failures in the world had been the precursors of ultimate\r\nsuccess! "Mildmay will lose his bill," said the Earl, sorrowfully.\r\n"There does not seem to be a doubt about that."\r\n\r\n"And what will you all do?" asked Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"We must go to the country, I suppose," said the Earl.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use? You can\'t have a more liberal House than you have\r\nnow," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"We may have one less liberal,--or rather less radical,--with fewer\r\nmen to support Mr. Turnbull. I do not see what else we can do. They\r\nsay that there are no less than twenty-seven men on our side of the\r\nHouse who will either vote with Turnbull against us, or will decline\r\nto vote at all."\r\n\r\n"Every one of them ought to lose his seat," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"But what can we do? How is the Queen\'s Government to be carried on?"\r\nWe all know the sad earnestness which impressed itself on the Earl\'s\r\nbrow as he asked these momentous questions. "I don\'t suppose that Mr.\r\nTurnbull can form a Ministry."\r\n\r\n"With Mr. Daubeny as whipper-in, perhaps he might," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"And will Mr. Finn lose his seat?" asked Violet Effingham. "Most\r\nprobably," said the Earl. "He only got it by an accident."\r\n\r\n"You must find him a seat somewhere in England," said Violet.\r\n\r\n"That might be difficult," said the Earl, who then left the room.\r\n\r\nThe two women remained together for some quarter of an hour before\r\nthey spoke again. Then Lady Laura said something about her brother.\r\n"If there be a dissolution, I hope Oswald will stand for Loughton."\r\nLoughton was a borough close to Saulsby, in which, as regarded its\r\npolitical interests, Lord Brentford was supposed to have considerable\r\ninfluence. To this Violet said nothing. "It is quite time," continued\r\nLady Laura, "that old Mr. Standish should give way. He has had the\r\nseat for twenty-five years, and has never done anything, and he\r\nseldom goes to the House now."\r\n\r\n"He is not your uncle, is he?"\r\n\r\n"No; he is papa\'s cousin; but he is ever so much older than\r\npapa;--nearly eighty, I believe."\r\n\r\n"Would not that be just the place for Mr. Finn?" said Violet.\r\n\r\nThen Lady Laura became very serious. "Oswald would of course have a\r\nbetter right to it than anybody else."\r\n\r\n"But would Lord Chiltern go into Parliament? I have heard him declare\r\nthat he would not."\r\n\r\n"If we could get papa to ask him, I think he would change his mind,"\r\nsaid Lady Laura.\r\n\r\nThere was again silence for a few moments, after which Violet\r\nreturned to the original subject of their conversation. "It would be\r\na thousand pities that Mr. Finn should be turned out into the cold.\r\nDon\'t you think so?"\r\n\r\n"I, for one, should be very sorry."\r\n\r\n"So should I,--and the more so from what Lord Brentford says about\r\nhis not speaking well last night. I don\'t think that it is very much\r\nof an accomplishment for a gentleman to speak well. Mr. Turnbull, I\r\nsuppose, speaks well; and they say that that horrid man, Mr. Bonteen,\r\ncan talk by the hour together. I don\'t think that it shows a man to\r\nbe clever at all. But I believe Mr. Finn would do it, if he set his\r\nmind to it, and I shall think it a great shame if they turn him out."\r\n\r\n"It would depend very much, I suppose, on Lord Tulla."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything about Lord Tulla," said Violet; "but I\'m quite\r\nsure that he might have Loughton, if we manage it properly. Of course\r\nLord Chiltern should have it if he wants it, but I don\'t think he\r\nwill stand in Mr. Finn\'s way."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid it\'s out of the question," said Lady Laura, gravely.\r\n"Papa thinks so much about the borough." The reader will remember\r\nthat both Lord Brentford and his daughter were thorough reformers!\r\nThe use of a little borough of his own, however, is a convenience to\r\na great peer.\r\n\r\n"Those difficult things have always to be talked of for a long while,\r\nand then they become easy," said Violet. "I believe if you were\r\nto propose to Mr. Kennedy to give all his property to the Church\r\nMissionaries and emigrate to New Zealand, he\'d begin to consider it\r\nseriously after a time."\r\n\r\n"I shall not try, at any rate."\r\n\r\n"Because you don\'t want to go to New Zealand;--but you might try\r\nabout Loughton for poor Mr. Finn."\r\n\r\n"Violet," said Lady Laura, after a moment\'s pause;--and she spoke\r\nsharply; "Violet, I believe you are in love with Mr. Finn."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just like you, Laura."\r\n\r\n"I never made such an accusation against you before, or against\r\nanybody else that I can remember. But I do begin to believe that you\r\nare in love with Mr. Finn."\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t I be in love with him, if I like?"\r\n\r\n"I say nothing about that;--only he has not got a penny."\r\n\r\n"But I have, my dear."\r\n\r\n"And I doubt whether you have any reason for supposing that he is in\r\nlove with you."\r\n\r\n"That would be my affair, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Then you are in love with him?"\r\n\r\n"That is my affair also."\r\n\r\nLady Laura shrugged her shoulders. "Of course it is; and if you tell\r\nme to hold my tongue, of course I will do so. If you ask me whether I\r\nthink it a good match, of course I must say I do not."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t tell you to hold your tongue, and I don\'t ask you what you\r\nthink about the match. You are quite welcome to talk as much about me\r\nas you please;--but as to Mr. Phineas Finn, you have no business to\r\nthink anything."\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t talk to anybody but yourself."\r\n\r\n"I am growing to be quite indifferent as to what people say. Lady\r\nBaldock asked me the other day whether I was going to throw myself\r\naway on Mr. Laurence Fitzgibbon."\r\n\r\n"No!"\r\n\r\n"Indeed she did."\r\n\r\n"And what did you answer?"\r\n\r\n"I told her that it was not quite settled; but that as I had only\r\nspoken to him once during the last two years, and then for not more\r\nthan half a minute, and as I wasn\'t sure whether I knew him by sight,\r\nand as I had reason to suppose he didn\'t know my name, there might,\r\nperhaps, be a delay of a week or two before the thing came off. Then\r\nshe flounced out of the room."\r\n\r\n"But what made her ask about Mr. Fitzgibbon?"\r\n\r\n"Somebody had been hoaxing her. I am beginning to think that Augusta\r\ndoes it for her private amusement. If so, I shall think more highly\r\nof my dear cousin than I have hitherto done. But, Laura, as you\r\nhave made a similar accusation against me, and as I cannot get out\r\nof it with you as I do with my aunt, I must ask you to hear my\r\nprotestation. I am not in love with Mr. Phineas Finn. Heaven help\r\nme;--as far as I can tell, I am not in love with any one, and never\r\nshall be." Lady Laura looked pleased. "Do you know," continued\r\nViolet, "that I think I could be in love with Mr. Phineas Finn, if\r\nI could be in love with anybody?" Then Lady Laura looked displeased.\r\n"In the first place, he is a gentleman," continued Violet. "Then he\r\nis a man of spirit. And then he has not too much spirit;--not that\r\nkind of spirit which makes some men think that they are the finest\r\nthings going. His manners are perfect;--not Chesterfieldian, and yet\r\nnever offensive. He never browbeats any one, and never toadies any\r\none. He knows how to live easily with men of all ranks, without any\r\nappearance of claiming a special status for himself. If he were made\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury to-morrow, I believe he would settle down\r\ninto the place of the first subject in the land without arrogance,\r\nand without false shame."\r\n\r\n"You are his eulogist with a vengeance."\r\n\r\n"I am his eulogist; but I am not in love with him. If he were to\r\nask me to be his wife to-morrow, I should be distressed, and should\r\nrefuse him. If he were to marry my dearest friend in the world, I\r\nshould tell him to kiss me and be my brother. As to Mr. Phineas\r\nFinn,--those are my sentiments."\r\n\r\n"What you say is very odd."\r\n\r\n"Why odd?"\r\n\r\n"Simply because mine are the same."\r\n\r\n"Are they the same? I once thought, Laura, that you did love\r\nhim;--that you meant to be his wife."\r\n\r\nLady Laura sat for a while without making any reply to this. She\r\nsat with her elbow on the table and with her face leaning on her\r\nhand,--thinking how far it would tend to her comfort if she spoke in\r\ntrue confidence. Violet during the time never took her eyes from her\r\nfriend\'s face, but remained silent as though waiting for an answer.\r\nShe had been very explicit as to her feelings. Would Laura Kennedy be\r\nequally explicit? She was too clever to forget that such plainness\r\nof speech would be, must be more difficult to Lady Laura than to\r\nherself. Lady Laura was a married woman; but she felt that her friend\r\nwould have been wrong to search for secrets, unless she were ready to\r\ntell her own. It was probably some such feeling which made Lady Laura\r\nspeak at last.\r\n\r\n"So I did, nearly--" said Lady Laura; "very nearly. You told me just\r\nnow that you had money, and could therefore do as you pleased. I had\r\nno money, and could not do as I pleased."\r\n\r\n"And you told me also that I had no reason for thinking that he cared\r\nfor me."\r\n\r\n"Did I? Well;--I suppose you have no reason. He did care for me. He\r\ndid love me."\r\n\r\n"He told you so?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--he told me so."\r\n\r\n"And how did you answer him?"\r\n\r\n"I had that very morning become engaged to Mr. Kennedy. That was my\r\nanswer."\r\n\r\n"And what did he say when you told him?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know. I cannot remember. But he behaved very well."\r\n\r\n"And now,--if he were to love me, you would grudge me his love?"\r\n\r\n"Not for that reason,--not if I know myself. Oh no! I would not be so\r\nselfish as that."\r\n\r\n"For what reason then?"\r\n\r\n"Because I look upon it as written in heaven that you are to be\r\nOswald\'s wife."\r\n\r\n"Heaven\'s writings then are false," said Violet, getting up and\r\nwalking away.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Phineas was very wretched at home. When he reached\r\nhis lodgings after leaving the House,--after his short conversation\r\nwith Mr. Monk,--he tried to comfort himself with what that gentleman\r\nhad said to him. For a while, while he was walking, there had been\r\nsome comfort in Mr. Monk\'s words. Mr. Monk had much experience, and\r\ndoubtless knew what he was saying,--and there might yet be hope. But\r\nall this hope faded away when Phineas was in his own rooms. There\r\ncame upon him, as he looked round them, an idea that he had no\r\nbusiness to be in Parliament, that he was an impostor, that he was\r\ngoing about the world under false pretences, and that he would never\r\nset himself aright, even unto himself, till he had gone through some\r\nterrible act of humiliation. He had been a cheat even to Mr. Quintus\r\nSlide of the _Banner_, in accepting an invitation to come among\r\nthem. He had been a cheat to Lady Laura, in that he had induced\r\nher to think that he was fit to live with her. He was a cheat to\r\nViolet Effingham, in assuming that he was capable of making himself\r\nagreeable to her. He was a cheat to Lord Chiltern when riding his\r\nhorses, and pretending to be a proper associate for a man of fortune.\r\nWhy,--what was his income? What his birth? What his proper position?\r\nAnd now he had got the reward which all cheats deserve. Then he went\r\nto bed, and as he lay there, he thought of Mary Flood Jones. Had he\r\nplighted his troth to Mary, and then worked like a slave under Mr.\r\nLow\'s auspices,--he would not have been a cheat.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him that he had hardly been asleep when the girl\r\ncame into his room in the morning. "Sir," said she, "there\'s that\r\ngentleman there."\r\n\r\n"What gentleman?"\r\n\r\n"The old gentleman."\r\n\r\nThen Phineas knew that Mr. Clarkson was in his sitting-room, and\r\nthat he would not leave it till he had seen the owner of the room.\r\nNay,--Phineas was pretty sure that Mr. Clarkson would come into the\r\nbedroom, if he were kept long waiting. "Damn the old gentleman," said\r\nPhineas in his wrath;--and the maid-servant heard him say so.\r\n\r\nIn about twenty minutes he went out into the sitting-room, with\r\nhis slippers on and in his dressing-gown. Suffering under the\r\ncircumstances of such an emergency, how is any man to go through the\r\nwork of dressing and washing with proper exactness? As to the prayers\r\nwhich he said on that morning, I think that no question should be\r\nasked. He came out with a black cloud on his brow, and with his mind\r\nhalf made up to kick Mr. Clarkson out of the room. Mr. Clarkson, when\r\nhe saw him, moved his chin round within his white cravat, as was a\r\ncustom with him, and put his thumb and forefinger on his lips, and\r\nthen shook his head.\r\n\r\n"Very bad, Mr. Finn; very bad indeed; very bad, ain\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"You coming here in this way at all times in the day is very bad,"\r\nsaid Phineas.\r\n\r\n"And where would you have me go? Would you like to see me down in the\r\nlobby of the House?"\r\n\r\n"To tell you the truth, Mr. Clarkson, I don\'t want to see you\r\nanywhere."\r\n\r\n"Ah; yes; I daresay! And that\'s what you call honest, being a\r\nParliament gent! You had my money, and then you tell me you don\'t\r\nwant to see me any more!"\r\n\r\n"I have not had your money," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"But let me tell you," continued Mr. Clarkson, "that I want to see\r\nyou;--and shall go on seeing you till the money is paid."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve not had any of your money," said Phineas.\r\n\r\nMr. Clarkson again twitched his chin about on the top of his cravat\r\nand smiled. "Mr. Finn," said he, showing the bill, "is that your\r\nname?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is."\r\n\r\n"Then I want my money."\r\n\r\n"I have no money to give you."\r\n\r\n"Do be punctual now. Why ain\'t you punctual? I\'d do anything for you\r\nif you were punctual. I would indeed." Mr. Clarkson, as he said this,\r\nsat down in the chair which had been placed for our hero\'s breakfast,\r\nand cutting a slice off the loaf, began to butter it with great\r\ncomposure.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Clarkson," said Phineas, "I cannot ask you to breakfast here. I\r\nam engaged."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll just take a bit of bread and butter all the same," said\r\nClarkson. "Where do you get your butter? Now I could tell you a woman\r\nwho\'d give it you cheaper and a deal better than this. This is all\r\nlard. Shall I send her to you?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Phineas. There was no tea ready, and therefore Mr.\r\nClarkson emptied the milk into a cup and drank it. "After this," said\r\nPhineas, "I must beg, Mr. Clarkson, that you will never come to my\r\nroom any more. I shall not be at home to you."\r\n\r\n"The lobby of the House is the same thing to me," said Mr. Clarkson.\r\n"They know me there well. I wish you\'d be punctual, and then we\'d be\r\nthe best of friends." After that Mr. Clarkson, having finished his\r\nbread and butter, took his leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nThe Second Reading Is Carried\r\n\r\n\r\nThe debate on the bill was prolonged during the whole of that week.\r\nLord Brentford, who loved his seat in the Cabinet and the glory of\r\nbeing a Minister, better even than he loved his borough, had taken\r\na gloomy estimate when he spoke of twenty-seven defaulters, and of\r\nthe bill as certainly lost. Men who were better able than he to make\r\nestimates,--the Bonteens and Fitzgibbons on each side of the House,\r\nand above all, the Ratlers and Robys, produced lists from day to\r\nday which varied now by three names in one direction, then by two\r\nin another, and which fluctuated at last by units only. They all\r\nconcurred in declaring that it would be a very near division. A great\r\neffort was made to close the debate on the Friday, but it failed, and\r\nthe full tide of speech was carried on till the following Monday. On\r\nthat morning Phineas heard Mr. Ratler declare at the club that, as\r\nfar as his judgment went, the division at that moment was a fair\r\nsubject for a bet. "There are two men doubtful in the House," said\r\nRatler, "and if one votes on one side and one on the other, or if\r\nneither votes at all, it will be a tie." Mr. Roby, however, the\r\nwhip on the other side, was quite sure that one at least of these\r\ngentlemen would go into his lobby, and that the other would not go\r\ninto Mr. Ratler\'s lobby. I am inclined to think that the town was\r\ngenerally inclined to put more confidence in the accuracy of Mr. Roby\r\nthan in that of Mr. Ratler; and among betting men there certainly\r\nwas a point given by those who backed the Conservatives. The odds,\r\nhowever, were lost, for on the division the numbers in the two\r\nlobbies were equal, and the Speaker gave his casting vote in favour\r\nof the Government. The bill was read a second time, and was lost, as\r\na matter of course, in reference to any subsequent action. Mr. Roby\r\ndeclared that even Mr. Mildmay could not go on with nothing but the\r\nSpeaker\'s vote to support him. Mr. Mildmay had no doubt felt that he\r\ncould not go on with his bill from the moment in which Mr. Turnbull\r\nhad declared his opposition; but he could not with propriety withdraw\r\nit in deference to Mr. Turnbull\'s opinion.\r\n\r\nDuring the week Phineas had had his hands sufficiently full. Twice he\r\nhad gone to the potted peas inquiry; but he had been at the office\r\nof the _People\'s Banner_ more often than that. Bunce had been very\r\nresolute in his determination to bring an action against the police\r\nfor false imprisonment, even though he spent every shilling of his\r\nsavings in doing so. And when his wife, in the presence of Phineas,\r\nbegged that bygones might be bygones, reminding him that spilt milk\r\ncould not be recovered, he called her a mean-spirited woman. Then\r\nMrs. Bunce wept a flood of tears, and told her favourite lodger that\r\nfor her all comfort in this world was over. "Drat the reformers, I\r\nsay. And I wish there was no Parliament; so I do. What\'s the use of\r\nall the voting, when it means nothing but dry bread and cross words?"\r\nPhineas by no means encouraged his landlord in his litigious spirit,\r\nadvising him rather to keep his money in his pocket, and leave the\r\nfighting of the battle to the columns of the _Banner_,--which would\r\nfight it, at any rate, with economy. But Bunce, though he delighted\r\nin the _Banner_, and showed an unfortunate readiness to sit at the\r\nfeet of Mr. Quintus Slide, would have his action at law;--in which\r\nresolution Mr. Slide did, I fear, encourage him behind the back of\r\nhis better friend, Phineas Finn.\r\n\r\nPhineas went with Bunce to Mr. Low\'s chambers,--for Mr. Low had in\r\nsome way become acquainted with the law-stationer\'s journeyman,--and\r\nthere some very good advice was given. "Have you asked yourself what\r\nis your object, Mr. Bunce?" said Mr. Low. Mr. Bunce declared he had\r\nasked himself that question, and had answered it. His object was\r\nredress. "In the shape of compensation to yourself," suggested Mr.\r\nLow. No; Mr. Bunce would not admit that he personally required any\r\ncompensation. The redress wanted was punishment to the man. "Is it\r\nfor vengeance?" asked Mr. Low. No; it was not for vengeance, Mr.\r\nBunce declared. "It ought not to be," continued Mr. Low; "because,\r\nthough you think that the man exceeded in his duty, you must feel\r\nthat he was doing so through no personal ill-will to yourself."\r\n\r\n"What I want is, to have the fellows kept in their proper places,"\r\nsaid Mr. Bunce.\r\n\r\n"Exactly;--and therefore these things, when they occur, are mentioned\r\nin the press and in Parliament,--and the attention of a Secretary of\r\nState is called to them. Thank God, we don\'t have very much of that\r\nkind of thing in England."\r\n\r\n"Maybe we shall have more if we don\'t look to it," said Bunce\r\nstoutly.\r\n\r\n"We always are looking to it," said Mr. Low;--"looking to it very\r\ncarefully. But I don\'t think anything is to be done in that way by\r\nindictment against a single man, whose conduct has been already\r\napproved by the magistrates. If you want notoriety, Mr. Bunce, and\r\ndon\'t mind what you pay for it; or have got anybody else to pay for\r\nit; then indeed--"\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t nobody to pay for it," said Bunce, waxing angry.\r\n\r\n"Then I certainly should not pay for it myself if I were you," said\r\nMr. Low.\r\n\r\nBut Bunce was not to be counselled out of his intention. When he was\r\nout in the square with Phineas he expressed great anger against Mr.\r\nLow. "He don\'t know what patriotism means," said the law scrivener.\r\n"And then he talks to me about notoriety! It has always been the\r\nsame way with \'em. If a man shows a spark of public feeling, it\'s\r\nall hambition. I don\'t want no notoriety. I wants to earn my bread\r\npeaceable, and to be let alone when I\'m about my own business. I pays\r\nrates for the police to look after rogues, not to haul folks about\r\nand lock \'em up for days and nights, who is doing what they has a\r\nlegal right to do." After that, Bunce went to his attorney, to the\r\ngreat detriment of the business at the stationer\'s shop, and Phineas\r\nvisited the office of the _People\'s Banner_. There he wrote a leading\r\narticle about Bunce\'s case, for which he was in due time to be paid\r\na guinea. After all, the _People\'s Banner_ might do more for him in\r\nthis way than ever would be done by Parliament. Mr. Slide, however,\r\nand another gentleman at the _Banner_ office, much older than Mr.\r\nSlide, who announced himself as the actual editor, were anxious that\r\nPhineas should rid himself of his heterodox political resolutions\r\nabout the ballot. It was not that they cared much about his own\r\nopinions; and when Phineas attempted to argue with the editor on the\r\nmerits of the ballot, the editor put him down very shortly. "We go in\r\nfor it, Mr. Finn," he said. If Mr. Finn would go in for it too, the\r\neditor seemed to think that Mr. Finn might make himself very useful\r\nat the _Banner_ Office. Phineas stoutly maintained that this was\r\nimpossible,--and was therefore driven to confine his articles in the\r\nservice of the people to those open subjects on which his opinions\r\nagreed with those of the _People\'s Banner_. This was his second\r\narticle, and the editor seemed to think that, backward as he was\r\nabout the ballot, he was too useful an aid to be thrown aside. A\r\nmember of Parliament is not now all that he was once, but still there\r\nis a prestige in the letters affixed to his name which makes him loom\r\nlarger in the eyes of the world than other men. Get into Parliament,\r\nif it be but for the borough of Loughshane, and the _People\'s\r\nBanners_ all round will be glad of your assistance, as will also\r\ncompanies limited and unlimited to a very marvellous extent. Phineas\r\nwrote his article and promised to look in again, and so they went\r\non. Mr. Quintus Slide continued to assure him that a "horgan" was\r\nindispensable to him, and Phineas began to accommodate his ears to\r\nthe sound which had at first been so disagreeable. He found that his\r\nacquaintance, Mr. Slide, had ideas of his own as to getting into\r\nthe \'Ouse at some future time. "I always look upon the \'Ouse as my\r\noyster, and \'ere\'s my sword," said Mr. Slide, brandishing an old\r\nquill pen. "And I feel that if once there I could get along. I do\r\nindeed. What is it a man wants? It\'s only pluck,--that he shouldn\'t\r\nfunk because a \'undred other men are looking at him." Then Phineas\r\nasked him whether he had any idea of a constituency, to which Mr.\r\nSlide replied that he had no absolutely formed intention. Many\r\nboroughs, however, would doubtless be set free from aristocratic\r\ninfluence by the redistribution of seats which must take place, as\r\nMr. Slide declared, at any rate in the next session. Then he named\r\nthe borough of Loughton; and Phineas Finn, thinking of Saulsby,\r\nthinking of the Earl, thinking of Lady Laura, and thinking of Violet,\r\nwalked away disgusted. Would it not be better that the quiet town,\r\nclustering close round the walls of Saulsby, should remain as it was,\r\nthan that it should be polluted by the presence of Mr. Quintus Slide?\r\n\r\nOn the last day of the debate, at a few moments before four o\'clock,\r\nPhineas encountered another terrible misfortune. He had been at the\r\npotted peas since twelve, and had on this occasion targed two or\r\nthree commissariat officers very tightly with questions respecting\r\ncabbages and potatoes, and had asked whether the officers on board\r\na certain ship did not always eat preserved asparagus while the men\r\nhad not even a bean. I fear that he had been put up to this business\r\nby Mr. Quintus Slide, and that he made himself nasty. There was,\r\nhowever, so much nastiness of the kind going, that his little effort\r\nmade no great difference. The conservative members of the Committee,\r\non whose side of the House the inquiry had originated, did not\r\nscruple to lay all manner of charges to officers whom, were they\r\nthemselves in power, they would be bound to support and would support\r\nwith all their energies. About a quarter before four the members of\r\nthe Committee had dismissed their last witness for the day, being\r\ndesirous of not losing their chance of seats on so important an\r\noccasion, and hurried down into the lobby,--so that they might enter\r\nthe House before prayers. Phineas here was button-holed by Barrington\r\nErle, who said something to him as to the approaching division. They\r\nwere standing in front of the door of the House, almost in the middle\r\nof the lobby, with a crowd of members around them,--on a spot which,\r\nas frequenters know, is hallowed ground, and must not be trodden by\r\nstrangers. He was in the act of answering Erle, when he was touched\r\non the arm, and on turning round, saw Mr. Clarkson. "About that\r\nlittle bill, Mr. Finn," said the horrible man, turning his chin round\r\nover his white cravat. "They always tell me at your lodgings that\r\nyou ain\'t at home." By this time a policeman was explaining to Mr.\r\nClarkson with gentle violence that he must not stand there,--that he\r\nmust go aside into one of the corners. "I know all that," said Mr.\r\nClarkson, retreating. "Of course I do. But what is a man to do when a\r\ngent won\'t see him at home?" Mr. Clarkson stood aside in his corner\r\nquietly, giving the policeman no occasion for further action against\r\nhim; but in retreating he spoke loud, and there was a lull of voices\r\naround, and twenty members at least had heard what had been said.\r\nPhineas Finn no doubt had his privilege, but Mr. Clarkson was\r\ndetermined that the privilege should avail him as little as possible.\r\n\r\nIt was very hard. The real offender, the Lord of the Treasury, the\r\npeer\'s son, with a thousand a year paid by the country was not\r\ntreated with this cruel persecution. Phineas had in truth never taken\r\na farthing from any one but his father; and though doubtless he owed\r\nsomething at this moment, he had no creditor of his own that was even\r\nangry with him. As the world goes he was a clear man,--but for this\r\ndebt of his friend Fitzgibbon. He left Barrington Erle in the lobby,\r\nand hurried into the House, blushing up to the eyes. He looked for\r\nFitzgibbon in his place, but the Lord of the Treasury was not as yet\r\nthere. Doubtless he would be there for the division, and Phineas\r\nresolved that he would speak a bit of his mind before he let his\r\nfriend out of his sight.\r\n\r\nThere were some great speeches made on that evening. Mr. Gresham\r\ndelivered an oration of which men said that it would be known in\r\nEngland as long as there were any words remaining of English\r\neloquence. In it he taunted Mr. Turnbull with being a recreant to\r\nthe people, of whom he called himself so often the champion. But Mr.\r\nTurnbull was not in the least moved. Mr. Gresham knew well enough\r\nthat Mr. Turnbull was not to be moved by any words;--but the words\r\nwere not the less telling to the House and to the country. Men, who\r\nheard it, said that Mr. Gresham forgot himself in that speech, forgot\r\nhis party, forgot his strategy, forgot his long-drawn schemes,--even\r\nhis love of applause, and thought only of his cause. Mr. Daubeny\r\nreplied to him with equal genius, and with equal skill,--if not with\r\nequal heart. Mr. Gresham had asked for the approbation of all present\r\nand of all future reformers. Mr. Daubeny denied him both,--the one\r\nbecause he would not succeed, and the other because he would not have\r\ndeserved success. Then Mr. Mildmay made his reply, getting up at\r\nabout three o\'clock, and uttered a prayer,--a futile prayer,--that\r\nthis his last work on behalf of his countrymen might be successful.\r\nHis bill was read a second time, as I have said before, in obedience\r\nto the casting vote of the Speaker,--but a majority such as that was\r\ntantamount to a defeat.\r\n\r\nThere was, of course, on that night no declaration as to what\r\nministers would do. Without a meeting of the Cabinet, and without\r\nsome further consideration, though each might know that the bill\r\nwould be withdrawn, they could not say in what way they would act.\r\nBut late as was the hour, there were many words on the subject before\r\nmembers were in their beds. Mr. Turnbull and Mr. Monk left the House\r\ntogether, and perhaps no two gentlemen in it had in former sessions\r\nbeen more in the habit of walking home arm-in-arm and discussing what\r\neach had heard and what each had said in that assembly. Latterly\r\nthese two men had gone strangely asunder in their paths,--very\r\nstrangely for men who had for years walked so closely together. And\r\nthis separation had been marked by violent words spoken against each\r\nother,--by violent words, at least, spoken against him in office by\r\nthe one who had never contaminated his hands by the Queen\'s shilling.\r\nAnd yet, on such an occasion as this, they were able to walk away\r\nfrom the House arm-in-arm, and did not fly at each other\'s throat by\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\n"Singular enough, is it not," said Mr. Turnbull, "that the thing\r\nshould have been so close?"\r\n\r\n"Very odd," said Mr. Monk; "but men have said that it would be so all\r\nthe week."\r\n\r\n"Gresham was very fine," said Mr. Turnbull.\r\n\r\n"Very fine, indeed. I never have heard anything like it before."\r\n\r\n"Daubeny was very powerful too," said Mr. Turnbull.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--no doubt. The occasion was great, and he answered to the spur.\r\nBut Gresham\'s was the speech of the debate."\r\n\r\n"Well;--yes; perhaps it was," said Mr. Turnbull, who was thinking of\r\nhis own flight the other night, and who among his special friends had\r\nbeen much praised for what he had then done. But of course he made\r\nno allusion to his own doings,--or to those of Mr. Monk. In this way\r\nthey conversed for some twenty minutes, till they parted; but neither\r\nof them interrogated the other as to what either might be called upon\r\nto do in consequence of the division which had just been effected.\r\nThey might still be intimate friends, but the days of confidence\r\nbetween them were passed.\r\n\r\nPhineas had seen Laurence Fitzgibbon enter the House,--which he did\r\nquite late in the night, so as to be in time for the division. No\r\ndoubt he had dined in the House, and had been all the evening in the\r\nlibrary,--or in the smoking-room. When Mr. Mildmay was on his legs\r\nmaking his reply, Fitzgibbon had sauntered in, not choosing to wait\r\ntill he might be rung up by the bell at the last moment. Phineas was\r\nnear him as they passed by the tellers, near him in the lobby, and\r\nnear him again as they all passed back into the House. But at the\r\nlast moment he thought that he would miss his prey. In the crowd\r\nas they left the House he failed to get his hand upon his friend\'s\r\nshoulder. But he hurried down the members\' passage, and just at the\r\ngate leading out into Westminster Hall he overtook Fitzgibbon walking\r\narm-in-arm with Barrington Erle.\r\n\r\n"Laurence," he said, taking hold of his countryman\'s arm with a\r\ndecided grasp, "I want to speak to you for a moment, if you please."\r\n\r\n"Speak away," said Laurence. Then Phineas, looking up into his face,\r\nknew very well that he had been--what the world calls, dining.\r\n\r\nPhineas remembered at the moment that Barrington Erle had been close\r\nto him when the odious money-lender had touched his arm and made\r\nhis inquiry about that "little bill." He much wished to make Erle\r\nunderstand that the debt was not his own,--that he was not in the\r\nhands of usurers in reference to his own concerns. But there was a\r\nfeeling within him that he still,--even still,--owed something to his\r\nfriendship to Fitzgibbon. "Just give me your arm, and come on with me\r\nfor a minute," said Phineas. "Erle will excuse us."\r\n\r\n"Oh, blazes!" said Laurence, "what is it you\'re after? I ain\'t good\r\nat private conferences at three in the morning. We\'re all out, and\r\nisn\'t that enough for ye?"\r\n\r\n"I have been dreadfully annoyed to-night," said Phineas, "and I\r\nwished to speak to you about it."\r\n\r\n"Bedad, Finn, my boy, and there are a good many of us are\r\nannoyed;--eh, Barrington?"\r\n\r\nPhineas perceived clearly that though Fitzgibbon had been dining,\r\nthere was as much of cunning in all this as of wine, and he was\r\ndetermined not to submit to such unlimited ill-usage. "My annoyance\r\ncomes from your friend, Mr. Clarkson, who had the impudence to\r\naddress me in the lobby of the House."\r\n\r\n"And serve you right, too, Finn, my boy. Why the devil did you sport\r\nyour oak to him? He has told me all about it. There ain\'t such a\r\npatient little fellow as Clarkson anywhere, if you\'ll only let him\r\nhave his own way. He\'ll look in, as he calls it, three times a week\r\nfor a whole season, and do nothing further. Of course he don\'t like\r\nto be locked out."\r\n\r\n"Is that the gentleman with whom the police interfered in the lobby?"\r\nErle inquired.\r\n\r\n"A confounded bill discounter to whom our friend here has introduced\r\nme,--for his own purposes," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"A very gentleman-like fellow," said Laurence. "Barrington knows\r\nhim, I daresay. Look here, Finn, my boy, take my advice. Ask him to\r\nbreakfast, and let him understand that the house will always be open\r\nto him." After this Laurence Fitzgibbon and Barrington Erle got into\r\na cab together, and were driven away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nA Cabinet Meeting\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now will the Muses assist me while I sing an altogether new song?\r\nOn the Tuesday the Cabinet met at the First Lord\'s official residence\r\nin Downing Street, and I will attempt to describe what, according to\r\nthe bewildered brain of a poor fictionist, was said or might have\r\nbeen said, what was done or might have been done, on so august an\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nThe poor fictionist very frequently finds himself to have been wrong\r\nin his description of things in general, and is told so, roughly by\r\nthe critics, and tenderly by the friends of his bosom. He is moved\r\nto tell of things of which he omits to learn the nature before he\r\ntells of them--as should be done by a strictly honest fictionist. He\r\ncatches salmon in October; or shoots his partridges in March. His\r\ndahlias bloom in June, and his birds sing in the autumn. He opens the\r\nopera-houses before Easter, and makes Parliament sit on a Wednesday\r\nevening. And then those terrible meshes of the Law! How is a\r\nfictionist, in these excited days, to create the needed biting\r\ninterest without legal difficulties; and how again is he to steer his\r\nlittle bark clear of so many rocks,--when the rocks and the shoals\r\nhave been purposely arranged to make the taking of a pilot on board a\r\nnecessity? As to those law meshes, a benevolent pilot will, indeed,\r\nnow and again give a poor fictionist a helping hand,--not used,\r\nhowever, generally, with much discretion. But from whom is any\r\nassistance to come in the august matter of a Cabinet assembly? There\r\ncan be no such assistance. No man can tell aught but they who will\r\ntell nothing. But then, again, there is this safety, that let the\r\nstory be ever so mistold,--let the fiction be ever so far removed\r\nfrom the truth, no critic short of a Cabinet Minister himself can\r\nconvict the narrator of error.\r\n\r\nIt was a large dingy room, covered with a Turkey carpet, and\r\ncontaining a dark polished mahogany dinner-table, on very heavy\r\ncarved legs, which an old messenger was preparing at two o\'clock in\r\nthe day for the use of her Majesty\'s Ministers. The table would have\r\nbeen large enough for fourteen guests, and along the side further\r\nfrom the fire, there were placed some six heavy chairs, good\r\ncomfortable chairs, stuffed at the back as well as the seat,--but on\r\nthe side nearer to the fire the chairs were placed irregularly; and\r\nthere were four armchairs,--two on one side and two on the other.\r\nThere were four windows to the room, which looked on to St. James\'s\r\nPark, and the curtains of the windows were dark and heavy,--as became\r\nthe gravity of the purposes to which that chamber was appropriated.\r\nIn old days it had been the dining-room of one Prime Minister after\r\nanother. To Pitt it had been the abode of his own familiar prandial\r\nPenates, and Lord Liverpool had been dull there among his dull\r\nfriends for long year after year. The Ministers of the present day\r\nfind it more convenient to live in private homes, and, indeed, not\r\nunfrequently carry their Cabinets with them. But, under Mr. Mildmay\'s\r\nrule, the meetings were generally held in the old room at the\r\nofficial residence. Thrice did the aged messenger move each armchair,\r\nnow a little this way and now a little that, and then look at them as\r\nthough something of the tendency of the coming meeting might depend\r\non the comfort of its leading members. If Mr. Mildmay should find\r\nhimself to be quite comfortable, so that he could hear what was said\r\nwithout a struggle to his ear, and see his colleagues\' faces clearly,\r\nand feel the fire without burning his shins, it might be possible\r\nthat he would not insist upon resigning. If this were so, how\r\nimportant was the work now confided to the hands of that aged\r\nmessenger! When his anxious eyes had glanced round the room some\r\nhalf a dozen times, when he had touched each curtain, laid his\r\nhand upon every chair, and dusted certain papers which lay upon a\r\nside-table,--and which had been lying there for two years, and at\r\nwhich no one ever looked or would look,--he gently crept away and\r\nensconced himself in an easy chair not far from the door of the\r\nchamber. For it might be necessary to stop the attempt of a rash\r\nintruder on those secret counsels.\r\n\r\nVery shortly there was heard the ring of various voices in the\r\npassages,--the voices of men speaking pleasantly, the voices of men\r\nwith whom it seemed, from their tone, that things were doing well\r\nin the world. And then a cluster of four or five gentlemen entered\r\nthe room. At first sight they seemed to be as ordinary gentlemen as\r\nyou shall meet anywhere about Pall Mall on an afternoon. There was\r\nnothing about their outward appearance of the august wiggery of\r\nstatecraft, nothing of the ponderous dignity of ministerial position.\r\nThat little man in the square-cut coat,--we may almost call it a\r\nshooting-coat,--swinging an umbrella and wearing no gloves, is no\r\nless a person than the Lord Chancellor,--Lord Weazeling,--who made\r\na hundred thousand pounds as Attorney-General, and is supposed\r\nto be the best lawyer of his age. He is fifty, but he looks to\r\nbe hardly over forty, and one might take him to be, from his\r\nappearance,--perhaps a clerk in the War Office, well-to-do, and\r\npopular among his brother-clerks. Immediately with him is Sir Harry\r\nColdfoot, also a lawyer by profession, though he has never practised.\r\nHe has been in the House for nearly thirty years, and is now at the\r\nHome Office. He is a stout, healthy, grey-haired gentleman, who\r\ncertainly does not wear the cares of office on his face. Perhaps,\r\nhowever, no minister gets more bullied than he by the press, and men\r\nsay that he will be very willing to give up to some political enemy\r\nthe control of the police, and the onerous duty of judging in all\r\ncriminal appeals. Behind these come our friend Mr. Monk, young Lord\r\nCantrip from the colonies next door, than whom no smarter young peer\r\nnow does honour to our hereditary legislature, and Sir Marmaduke\r\nMorecombe, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Why Sir\r\nMarmaduke has always been placed in Mr. Mildmay\'s Cabinets nobody\r\never knew. As Chancellor of the Duchy he has nothing to do,--and were\r\nthere anything, he would not do it. He rarely speaks in the House,\r\nand then does not speak well. He is a handsome man, or would be but\r\nfor an assumption of grandeur in the carriage of his eyes, giving to\r\nhis face a character of pomposity which he himself well deserves. He\r\nwas in the Guards when young, and has been in Parliament since he\r\nceased to be young. It must be supposed that Mr. Mildmay has found\r\nsomething in him, for he has been included in three successive\r\nliberal Cabinets. He has probably the virtue of being true to Mr.\r\nMildmay, and of being duly submissive to one whom he recognises as\r\nhis superior.\r\n\r\nWithin two minutes afterwards the Duke followed, with Plantagenet\r\nPalliser. The Duke, as all the world knows, was the Duke of St.\r\nBungay, the very front and head of the aristocratic old Whigs of the\r\ncountry,--a man who has been thrice spoken of as Prime Minister, and\r\nwho really might have filled the office had he not known himself to\r\nbe unfit for it. The Duke has been consulted as to the making of\r\nCabinets for the last five-and-thirty years, and is even now not an\r\nold man in appearance;--a fussy, popular, clever, conscientious man,\r\nwhose digestion has been too good to make politics a burden to him,\r\nbut who has thought seriously about his country, and is one who will\r\nbe sure to leave memoirs behind him. He was born in the semi-purple\r\nof ministerial influences, and men say of him that he is honester\r\nthan his uncle, who was Canning\'s friend, but not so great a man as\r\nhis grandfather, with whom Fox once quarrelled, and whom Burke loved.\r\nPlantagenet Palliser, himself the heir to a dukedom, was the young\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, of whom some statesmen thought much as\r\nthe rising star of the age. If industry, rectitude of purpose, and\r\na certain clearness of intellect may prevail, Planty Pall, as he is\r\nfamiliarly called, may become a great Minister.\r\n\r\nThen came Viscount Thrift by himself;--the First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty, with the whole weight of a new iron-clad fleet upon his\r\nshoulders. He has undertaken the Herculean task of cleansing the\r\ndockyards,--and with it the lesser work of keeping afloat a navy that\r\nmay be esteemed by his countrymen to be the best in the world. And he\r\nthinks that he will do both, if only Mr. Mildmay will not resign;--an\r\nindustrious, honest, self-denying nobleman, who works without ceasing\r\nfrom morn to night, and who hopes to rise in time to high things,--to\r\nthe translating of Homer, perhaps, and the wearing of the Garter.\r\n\r\nClose behind him there was a ruck of Ministers, with the\r\nmuch-honoured grey-haired old Premier in the midst of them. There was\r\nMr. Gresham, the Foreign Minister, said to be the greatest orator\r\nin Europe, on whose shoulders it was thought that the mantle of Mr.\r\nMildmay would fall,--to be worn, however, quite otherwise than Mr.\r\nMildmay had worn it. For Mr. Gresham is a man with no feelings\r\nfor the past, void of historical association, hardly with\r\nmemories,--living altogether for the future which he is anxious to\r\nfashion anew out of the vigour of his own brain. Whereas, with Mr.\r\nMildmay, even his love of reform is an inherited passion for an\r\nold-world Liberalism. And there was with them Mr. Legge Wilson, the\r\nbrother of a peer, Secretary at War, a great scholar and a polished\r\ngentleman, very proud of his position as a Cabinet Minister, but\r\nconscious that he has hardly earned it by political work. And Lord\r\nPlinlimmon is with them, the Comptroller of India,--of all working\r\nlords the most jaunty, the most pleasant, and the most popular, very\r\ngood at taking chairs at dinners, and making becoming speeches at the\r\nshortest notice, a man apparently very free and open in his ways of\r\nlife,--but cautious enough in truth as to every step, knowing well\r\nhow hard it is to climb and how easy to fall. Mr. Mildmay entered\r\nthe room leaning on Lord Plinlimmon\'s arm, and when he made his way\r\nup among the armchairs upon the rug before the fire, the others\r\nclustered around him with cheering looks and kindly questions. Then\r\ncame the Privy Seal, our old friend Lord Brentford, last,--and\r\nI would say least, but that the words of no councillor could go\r\nfor less in such an assemblage than will those of Sir Marmaduke\r\nMorecombe, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.\r\n\r\nMr. Mildmay was soon seated in one of the armchairs, while Lord\r\nPlinlimmon leaned against the table close at his elbow. Mr. Gresham\r\nstood upright at the corner of the chimney-piece furthest from Mr.\r\nMildmay, and Mr. Palliser at that nearest to him. The Duke took the\r\narmchair close at Mr. Mildmay\'s left hand. Lord Plinlimmon was, as I\r\nhave said, leaning against the table, but the Lord Chancellor, who\r\nwas next to him, sat upon it. Viscount Thrift and Mr. Monk occupied\r\nchairs on the further side of the table, near to Mr. Mildmay\'s end,\r\nand Mr. Legge Wilson placed himself at the head of the table, thus\r\njoining them as it were into a body. The Home Secretary stood before\r\nthe Lord Chancellor screening him from the fire, and the Chancellor\r\nof the Duchy, after waiting for a few minutes as though in doubt,\r\ntook one of the vacant armchairs. The young lord from the Colonies\r\nstood a little behind the shoulders of his great friend from the\r\nForeign Office; and the Privy Seal, after moving about for a while\r\nuneasily, took a chair behind the Chancellor of the Duchy. One\r\narmchair was thus left vacant, but there was no other comer.\r\n\r\n"It is not so bad as I thought it would be," said the Duke, speaking\r\naloud, but nevertheless addressing himself specially to his chief.\r\n\r\n"It was bad enough," said Mr. Mildmay, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Bad enough indeed," said Sir Marmaduke Morecombe, without any\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n"And such a good bill lost," said Lord Plinlimmon. "The worst of\r\nthese failures is, that the same identical bill can never be brought\r\nin again."\r\n\r\n"So that if the lost bill was best, the bill that will not be lost\r\ncan only be second best," said the Lord Chancellor.\r\n\r\n"I certainly did think that after the debate before Easter we should\r\nnot have come to shipwreck about the ballot," said Mr. Mildmay.\r\n\r\n"It was brewing for us all along," said Mr. Gresham, who then with a\r\ngesture of his hand and a pressure of his lips withheld words which\r\nhe was nearly uttering, and which would not, probably, have been\r\ncomplimentary to Mr. Turnbull. As it was, he turned half round and\r\nsaid something to Lord Cantrip which was not audible to any one else\r\nin the room. It was worthy of note, however, that Mr. Turnbull\'s name\r\nwas not once mentioned aloud at that meeting.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid it was brewing all along," said Sir Marmaduke Morecombe\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n"Well, gentlemen, we must take it as we get it," said Mr. Mildmay,\r\nstill smiling. "And now we must consider what we shall do at once."\r\nThen he paused as though expecting that counsel would come to him\r\nfirst from one colleague and then from another. But no such counsel\r\ncame, and probably Mr. Mildmay did not in the least expect that it\r\nwould come.\r\n\r\n"We cannot stay where we are, of course," said the Duke. The Duke was\r\nprivileged to say as much as that. But though every man in the room\r\nknew that it must be so, no one but the Duke would have said it,\r\nbefore Mr. Mildmay had spoken plainly himself.\r\n\r\n"No," said Mr. Mildmay; "I suppose that we can hardly stay where we\r\nare. Probably none of us wish it, gentlemen." Then he looked round\r\nupon his colleagues, and there came a sort of an assent, though there\r\nwere no spoken words. The sound from Sir Marmaduke Morecombe was\r\nlouder than that from the others;--but yet from him it was no more\r\nthan an attesting grunt. "We have two things to consider," continued\r\nMr. Mildmay,--and though he spoke in a very low voice, every word was\r\nheard by all present,--"two things chiefly, that is; the work of the\r\ncountry and the Queen\'s comfort. I propose to see her Majesty this\r\nafternoon at five,--that is, in something less than two hours\' time,\r\nand I hope to be able to tell the House by seven what has taken place\r\nbetween her Majesty and me. My friend, his Grace, will do as much in\r\nthe House of Lords. If you agree with me, gentlemen, I will explain\r\nto the Queen that it is not for the welfare of the country that we\r\nshould retain our places, and I will place your resignations and my\r\nown in her Majesty\'s hands."\r\n\r\n"You will advise her Majesty to send for Lord de Terrier," said Mr.\r\nGresham.\r\n\r\n"Certainly;--there will be no other course open to me."\r\n\r\n"Or to her," said Mr. Gresham. To this remark from the rising\r\nMinister of the day, no word of reply was made; but of those present\r\nin the room three or four of the most experienced servants of the\r\nCrown felt that Mr. Gresham had been imprudent. The Duke, who had.\r\never been afraid of Mr. Gresham, told Mr. Palliser afterwards that\r\nsuch an observation should not have been made; and Sir Harry Coldfoot\r\npondered upon it uneasily, and Sir Marmaduke Morecombe asked Mr.\r\nMildmay what he thought about it. "Times change so much, and with the\r\ntimes the feelings of men," said Mr. Mildmay. But I doubt whether Sir\r\nMarmaduke quite understood him.\r\n\r\nThere was silence in the room for a moment or two after Mr. Gresham\r\nhad spoken, and then Mr. Mildmay again addressed his friends. "Of\r\ncourse it may be possible that my Lord de Terrier may foresee\r\ndifficulties, or may find difficulties which will oblige him, either\r\nat once, or after an attempt has been made, to decline the task which\r\nher Majesty will probably commit to him. All of us, no doubt, know\r\nthat the arrangement of a government is not the most easy task in\r\nthe world; and that it is not made the more easy by an absence of a\r\nmajority in the House of Commons."\r\n\r\n"He would dissolve, I presume," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"I should say so," continued Mr. Mildmay. "But it may not improbably\r\ncome to pass that her Majesty will feel herself obliged to send again\r\nfor some one or two of us, that we may tender to her Majesty the\r\nadvice which we owe to her;--for me, for instance, or for my friend\r\nthe Duke. In such a matter she would be much guided probably by what\r\nLord de Terrier might have suggested to her. Should this be so, and\r\nshould I be consulted, my present feeling is that we should resume\r\nour offices so that the necessary business of the session should be\r\ncompleted, and that we should then dissolve Parliament, and thus\r\nascertain the opinion of the country. In such case, however, we\r\nshould of course meet again."\r\n\r\n"I quite think that the course proposed by Mr. Mildmay will be the\r\nbest," said the Duke, who had no doubt already discussed the matter\r\nwith his friend the Prime Minister in private. No one else said a\r\nword either of argument or disagreement, and the Cabinet Council was\r\nbroken up. The old messenger, who had been asleep in his chair, stood\r\nup and bowed as the Ministers walked by him, and then went in and\r\nrearranged the chairs.\r\n\r\n"He has as much idea of giving up as you or I have," said Lord\r\nCantrip to his friend Mr. Gresham, as they walked arm-in-arm together\r\nfrom the Treasury Chambers across St. James\'s Park towards the clubs.\r\n\r\n"I am not sure that he is not right," said Mr. Gresham.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean for himself or for the country?" asked Lord Cantrip.\r\n\r\n"For his future fame. They who have abdicated and have clung to their\r\nabdication have always lost by it. Cincinnatus was brought back\r\nagain, and Charles V. is felt to have been foolish. The peaches of\r\nretired ministers of which we hear so often have generally been\r\ncultivated in a constrained seclusion;--or at least the world so\r\nbelieves." They were talking probably of Mr. Mildmay, as to whom some\r\nof his colleagues had thought it probable, knowing that he would now\r\nresign, that he would have to-day declared his intention of laying\r\naside for ever the cares of office.\r\n\r\nMr. Monk walked home alone, and as he went there was something of\r\na feeling of disappointment at heart, which made him ask himself\r\nwhether Mr. Turnbull might not have been right in rebuking him for\r\njoining the Government. But this, I think, was in no way due to Mr.\r\nMildmay\'s resignation, but rather to a conviction on Mr. Monk\'s part\r\nthat that he had contributed but little to his country\'s welfare by\r\nsitting in Mr. Mildmay\'s Cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nMr. Kennedy\'s Luck\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the holding of that Cabinet Council of which the author has\r\ndared to attempt a slight sketch in the last chapter, there were\r\nvarious visits made to the Queen, first by Mr. Mildmay, and then by\r\nLord de Terrier, afterwards by Mr. Mildmay and the Duke together, and\r\nthen again by Lord de Terrier; and there were various explanations\r\nmade to Parliament in each House, and rivals were very courteous to\r\neach other, promising assistance;--and at the end of it the old men\r\nheld their seats. The only change made was effected by the retirement\r\nof Sir Marmaduke Morecombe, who was raised to the peerage, and by\r\nthe selection of--Mr. Kennedy to fill his place in the Cabinet. Mr.\r\nKennedy during the late debate had made one of those speeches, few\r\nand far between, by which he had created for himself a Parliamentary\r\nreputation; but, nevertheless, all men expressed their great\r\nsurprise, and no one could quite understand why Mr. Kennedy had been\r\nmade a Cabinet Minister.\r\n\r\n"It is impossible to say whether he is pleased or not," said Lady\r\nLaura, speaking of him to Phineas. "I am pleased, of course."\r\n\r\n"His ambition must be gratified," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"It would be, if he had any," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"I do not believe in a man lacking ambition."\r\n\r\n"It is hard to say. There are men who by no means wear their hearts\r\nupon their sleeves, and my husband is one of them. He told me that it\r\nwould be unbecoming in him to refuse, and that was all he said to me\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\nThe old men held their seats, but they did so as it were only upon\r\nfurther trial. Mr. Mildmay took the course which he had indicated to\r\nhis colleagues at the Cabinet meeting. Before all the explanations\r\nand journeyings were completed, April was over, and the much-needed\r\nWhitsuntide holidays were coming on. But little of the routine work\r\nof the session had been done; and, as Mr. Mildmay told the House\r\nmore than once, the country would suffer were the Queen to dissolve\r\nParliament at this period of the year. The old Ministers would go on\r\nwith the business of the country, Lord de Terrier with his followers\r\nhaving declined to take affairs into their hands; and at the close of\r\nthe session, which should be made as short as possible, writs should\r\nbe issued for new elections. This was Mr. Mildmay\'s programme, and it\r\nwas one of which no one dared to complain very loudly.\r\n\r\nMr. Turnbull, indeed, did speak a word of caution. He told Mr.\r\nMildmay that he had lost his bill, good in other respects, because he\r\nhad refused to introduce the ballot into his measure. Let him promise\r\nto be wiser for the future, and to obey the manifested wishes of the\r\ncountry, and then all would be well with him. In answer to this,\r\nMr. Mildmay declared that to the best of his power of reading the\r\ncountry, his countrymen had manifested no such wish; and that if they\r\ndid so, if by the fresh election it should be shown that the ballot\r\nwas in truth desired, he would at once leave the execution of their\r\nwishes to abler and younger hands. Mr. Turnbull expressed himself\r\nperfectly satisfied with the Minister\'s answers, and said that the\r\ncoming election would show whether he or Mr. Mildmay were right.\r\n\r\nMany men, and among them some of his colleagues, thought that Mr.\r\nMildmay had been imprudent. "No man ought ever to pledge himself\r\nto anything," said Sir Harry Coldfoot to the Duke;--"that is, to\r\nanything unnecessary." The Duke, who was very true to Mr. Mildmay,\r\nmade no reply to this, but even he thought that his old friend\r\nhad been betrayed into a promise too rapidly. But the pledge was\r\ngiven, and some people already began to make much of it. There\r\nappeared leader after leader in the _People\'s Banner_ urging the\r\nconstituencies to take advantage of the Prime Minister\'s words, and\r\nto show clearly at the hustings that they desired the ballot. "You\r\nhad better come over to us, Mr. Finn; you had indeed," said Mr.\r\nSlide. "Now\'s the time to do it, and show yourself a people\'s friend.\r\nYou\'ll have to do it sooner or later,--whether or no. Come to us and\r\nwe\'ll be your horgan."\r\n\r\nBut in those days Phineas was something less in love with Mr. Quintus\r\nSlide than he had been at the time of the great debate, for he was\r\nbecoming more and more closely connected with people who in their\r\nways of living and modes of expression were very unlike Mr. Slide.\r\nThis advice was given to him about the end of May, and at that\r\ntime Lord Chiltern was living with him in the lodgings in Great\r\nMarlborough Street. Miss Pouncefoot had temporarily vacated her\r\nrooms on the first floor, and the Lord with the broken bones had\r\ncondescended to occupy them. "I don\'t know that I like having a\r\nLord," Bunce had said to his wife. "It\'ll soon come to you not liking\r\nanybody decent anywhere," Mrs. Bunce had replied; "but I shan\'t ask\r\nany questions about it. When you\'re wasting so much time and money\r\nat your dirty law proceedings, it\'s well that somebody should earn\r\nsomething at home."\r\n\r\nThere had been many discussions about the bringing of Lord Chiltern\r\nup to London, in all of which Phineas had been concerned. Lord\r\nBrentford had thought that his son had better remain down at the\r\nWillingford Bull; and although he said that the rooms were at his\r\nson\'s disposal should Lord Chiltern choose to come to London, still\r\nhe said it in such a way that Phineas, who went down to Willingford,\r\ncould not tell his friend that he would be made welcome in Portman\r\nSquare. "I think I shall leave those diggings altogether," Lord\r\nChiltern said to him. "My father annoys me by everything he says and\r\ndoes, and I annoy him by saying and doing nothing." Then there came\r\nan invitation to him from Lady Laura and Mr. Kennedy. Would he come\r\nto Grosvenor Place? Lady Laura pressed this very much, though in\r\ntruth Mr. Kennedy had hardly done more than give a cold assent. But\r\nLord Chiltern would not hear of it. "There is some reason for my\r\ngoing to my father\'s house," said he, "though he and I are not the\r\nbest friends in the world; but there can be no reason for my going\r\nto the house of a man I dislike so much as I do Robert Kennedy." The\r\nmatter was settled in the manner told above. Miss Pouncefoot\'s rooms\r\nwere prepared for him at Mr. Bunce\'s house, and Phineas Finn went\r\ndown to Willingford and brought him up. "I\'ve sold Bonebreaker," he\r\nsaid,--"to a young fellow whose neck will certainly be the sacrifice\r\nif he attempts to ride him. I\'d have given him to you, Phineas, only\r\nyou wouldn\'t have known what to do with him."\r\n\r\nLord Chiltern when he came up to London was still in bandages,\r\nthough, as the surgeon said, his bones seemed to have been made to be\r\nbroken and set again; and his bandages of course were a sufficient\r\nexcuse for his visiting the house neither of his father nor his\r\nbrother-in-law. But Lady Laura went to him frequently, and thus\r\nbecame acquainted with our hero\'s home and with Mrs. Bunce. And there\r\nwere messages taken from Violet to the man in bandages, some of which\r\nlost nothing in the carrying. Once Lady Laura tried to make Violet\r\nthink that it would be right, or rather not wrong, that they two\r\nshould go together to Lord Chiltern\'s rooms.\r\n\r\n"And would you have me tell my aunt, or would you have me not tell\r\nher?" Violet asked.\r\n\r\n"I would have you do just as you pleased," Lady Laura answered.\r\n\r\n"So I shall," Violet replied, "but I will do nothing that I should be\r\nashamed to tell any one. Your brother professes to be in love with\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"He is in love with you," said Lady Laura. "Even you do not pretend\r\nto doubt his faith."\r\n\r\n"Very well. In those circumstances a girl should not go to a man\'s\r\nrooms unless she means to consider herself as engaged to him, even\r\nwith his sister;--not though he had broken every bone in his skin. I\r\nknow what I may do, Laura, and I know what I mayn\'t; and I won\'t be\r\nled either by you or by my aunt."\r\n\r\n"May I give him your love?"\r\n\r\n"No;--because you\'ll give it in a wrong spirit. He knows well enough\r\nthat I wish him well;--but you may tell him that from me, if you\r\nplease. He has from me all those wishes which one friend owes to\r\nanother."\r\n\r\nBut there were other messages sent from Violet through Phineas Finn\r\nwhich she worded with more show of affection,--perhaps as much for\r\nthe discomfort of Phineas as for the consolation of Lord Chiltern.\r\n"Tell him to take care of himself," said Violet, "and bid him not to\r\nhave any more of those wild brutes that are not fit for any Christian\r\nto ride. Tell him that I say so. It\'s a great thing to be brave; but\r\nwhat\'s the use of being foolhardy?"\r\n\r\nThe session was to be closed at the end of June, to the great dismay\r\nof London tradesmen and of young ladies who had not been entirely\r\nsuccessful in the early season. But before the old Parliament was\r\nclosed, and the writs for the new election were despatched, there\r\noccurred an incident which was of very much importance to Phineas\r\nFinn. Near the end of June, when the remaining days of the session\r\nwere numbered by three or four, he had been dining at Lord\r\nBrentford\'s house in Portman Square in company with Mr. Kennedy. But\r\nLady Laura had not been there. At this time he saw Lord Brentford not\r\nunfrequently, and there was always a word said about Lord Chiltern.\r\nThe father would ask how the son occupied himself, and Phineas would\r\nhope,--though hitherto he had hoped in vain,--that he would induce\r\nthe Earl to come and see Lord Chiltern. Lord Brentford could never be\r\nbrought to that; but it was sufficiently evident that he would have\r\ndone so, had he not been afraid to descend so far from the altitude\r\nof his paternal wrath. On this evening, at about eleven, Mr. Kennedy\r\nand Phineas left the house together, and walked from the Square\r\nthrough Orchard Street into Oxford Street. Here their ways parted,\r\nbut Phineas crossed the road with Mr. Kennedy, as he was making some\r\nreply to a second invitation to Loughlinter. Phineas, considering\r\nwhat had been said before on the subject, thought that the invitation\r\ncame late, and that it was not warmly worded. He had, therefore,\r\ndeclined it, and was in the act of declining it, when he crossed the\r\nroad with Mr. Kennedy. In walking down Orchard Street from the Square\r\nhe had seen two men standing in the shadow a few yards up a mews or\r\nsmall alley that was there, but had thought nothing of them. It was\r\njust that period of the year when there is hardly any of the darkness\r\nof night; but at this moment there were symptoms of coming rain, and\r\nheavy drops began to fall; and there were big clouds coming and going\r\nbefore the young moon. Mr. Kennedy had said that he would get a cab,\r\nbut he had seen none as he crossed Oxford Street, and had put up his\r\numbrella as he made his way towards Park Street. Phineas as he left\r\nhim distinctly perceived the same two figures on the other side of\r\nOxford Street, and then turning into the shadow of a butcher\'s porch,\r\nhe saw them cross the street in the wake of Mr. Kennedy. It was now\r\nraining in earnest, and the few passengers who were out were scudding\r\naway quickly, this way and that.\r\n\r\nIt hardly occurred to Phineas to think that any danger was imminent\r\nto Mr. Kennedy from the men, but it did occur to him that he might as\r\nwell take some notice of the matter. Phineas knew that Mr. Kennedy\r\nwould make his way down Park Street, that being his usual route from\r\nPortman Square towards his own home, and knew also that he himself\r\ncould again come across Mr. Kennedy\'s track by going down North\r\nAudley Street to the corner of Grosvenor Square, and thence by Brook\r\nStreet into Park Street. Without much thought, therefore, he went\r\nout of his own course down to the corner of the Square, hurrying his\r\nsteps till he was running, and then ran along Brook Street, thinking\r\nas he went of some special word that he might say to Mr. Kennedy as\r\nan excuse, should he again come across his late companion. He reached\r\nthe corner of Park Street before that gentleman could have been there\r\nunless he also had run; but just in time to see him as he was coming\r\non,--and also to see in the dark glimmering of the slight uncertain\r\nmoonlight that the two men were behind him. He retreated a step\r\nbackwards in the corner, resolving that when Mr. Kennedy came up,\r\nthey two would go on together; for now it was clear that Mr. Kennedy\r\nwas followed. But Mr. Kennedy did not reach the corner. When he was\r\nwithin two doors of it, one of the men had followed him up quickly,\r\nand had thrown something round his throat from behind him. Phineas\r\nunderstood well now that his friend was in the act of being\r\ngarrotted, and that his instant assistance was needed. He rushed\r\nforward, and as the second ruffian had been close upon the footsteps\r\nof the first, there was almost instantaneously a concourse of the\r\nfour men. But there was no fight. The man who had already nearly\r\nsucceeded in putting Mr. Kennedy on to his back, made no attempt to\r\nseize his prey when he found that so unwelcome an addition had joined\r\nthe party, but instantly turned to fly. His companion was turning\r\nalso, but Phineas was too quick for him, and having seized on to his\r\ncollar, held to him with all his power. "Dash it all," said the man,\r\n"didn\'t yer see as how I was a-hurrying up to help the gen\'leman\r\nmyself?" Phineas, however, hadn\'t seen this, and held on gallantly,\r\nand in a couple of minutes the first ruffian was back again upon the\r\nspot in the custody of a policeman. "You\'ve done it uncommon neat,\r\nsir," said the policeman, complimenting Phineas upon his performance.\r\n"If the gen\'leman ain\'t none the worst for it, it\'ll have been a very\r\npretty evening\'s amusement." Mr. Kennedy was now leaning against the\r\nrailings, and hitherto had been unable to declare whether he was\r\nreally injured or not, and it was not till a second policeman came up\r\nthat the hero of the night was at liberty to attend closely to his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nMr. Kennedy, when he was able to speak, declared that for a minute\r\nor two he had thought that his neck had been broken; and he was not\r\nquite convinced till he found himself in his own house, that nothing\r\nmore serious had really happened to him than certain bruises round\r\nhis throat. The policeman was for a while anxious that at any\r\nrate Phineas should go with him to the police-office; but at last\r\nconsented to take the addresses of the two gentlemen. When he\r\nfound that Mr. Kennedy was a member of Parliament, and that he was\r\ndesignated as Right Honourable, his respect for the garrotter became\r\nmore great, and he began to feel that the night was indeed a night\r\nof great importance. He expressed unbounded admiration at Mr. Finn\'s\r\nsuccess in his own line, and made repeated promises that the men\r\nshould be forthcoming on the morrow. Could a cab be got? Of course a\r\ncab could be got. A cab was got, and within a quarter of an hour of\r\nthe making of the attack, the two members of Parliament were on their\r\nway to Grosvenor Place.\r\n\r\nThere was hardly a word spoken in the cab, for Mr. Kennedy was in\r\npain. When, however, they reached the door in Grosvenor Place,\r\nPhineas wanted to go, and leave his friend with the servants, but\r\nthis the Cabinet Minister would not allow. "Of course you must see\r\nmy wife," he said. So they went up-stairs into the drawing-room,\r\nand then upon the stairs, by the lights of the house, Phineas could\r\nperceive that his companion\'s face was bruised and black with dirt,\r\nand that his cravat was gone.\r\n\r\n"I have been garrotted," said the Cabinet Minister to his wife.\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Simply that;--or should have been, if he had not been there. How he\r\ncame there, God only knows."\r\n\r\nThe wife\'s anxiety, and then her gratitude, need hardly be\r\ndescribed,--nor the astonishment of the husband, which by no means\r\ndecreased on reflection, at the opportune re-appearance in the nick\r\nof time of the man whom three minutes before the attack he had left\r\nin the act of going in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n"I had seen the men, and thought it best to run round by the corner\r\nof Grosvenor Square," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"May God bless you," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"Amen," said the Cabinet Minister.\r\n\r\n"I think he was born to be my friend," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet Minister said nothing more that night. He was never given\r\nto much talking, and the little accident which had just occurred to\r\nhim did not tend to make words easy to him. But he pressed our hero\'s\r\nhand, and Lady Laura said that of course Phineas would come to them\r\non the morrow. Phineas remarked that his first business must be to\r\ngo to the police-office, but he promised that he would come down to\r\nGrosvenor Place immediately afterwards. Then Lady Laura also pressed\r\nhis hand, and looked--; she looked, I think, as though she thought\r\nthat Phineas would only have done right had he repeated the offence\r\nwhich he had committed under the waterfall of Loughlinter.\r\n\r\n"Garrotted!" said Lord Chiltern, when Phineas told him the story\r\nbefore they went to bed that night. He had been smoking, sipping\r\nbrandy-and-water, and waiting for Finn\'s return. "Robert Kennedy\r\ngarrotted!"\r\n\r\n"The fellow was in the act of doing it."\r\n\r\n"And you stopped him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I got there just in time. Wasn\'t it lucky?"\r\n\r\n"You ought to be garrotted yourself. I should have lent the man a\r\nhand had I been there."\r\n\r\n"How can you say anything so horrible? But you are drinking too much,\r\nold fellow, and I shall lock the bottle up."\r\n\r\n"If there were no one in London drank more than I do, the wine\r\nmerchants would have a bad time of it. And so the new Cabinet\r\nMinister has been garrotted in the street. Of course I\'m sorry for\r\npoor Laura\'s sake."\r\n\r\n"Luckily he\'s not much the worse for it;--only a little bruised."\r\n\r\n"I wonder whether it\'s on the cards he should be improved by\r\nit;--worse, except in the way of being strangled, he could not be.\r\nHowever, as he\'s my brother-in-law, I\'m obliged to you for rescuing\r\nhim. Come, I\'ll go to bed. I must say, if he was to be garrotted I\r\nshould like to have been there to see it." That was the manner in\r\nwhich Lord Chiltern received the tidings of the terrible accident\r\nwhich had occurred to his near relative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nFinn for Loughton\r\n\r\n\r\nBy three o\'clock in the day after the little accident which was told\r\nin the last chapter, all the world knew that Mr. Kennedy, the new\r\nCabinet Minister, had been garrotted, or half garrotted, and that\r\nthat child of fortune, Phineas Finn, had dropped upon the scene out\r\nof heaven at the exact moment of time, had taken the two garrotters\r\nprisoners, and saved the Cabinet Minister\'s neck and valuables,--if\r\nnot his life. "Bedad," said Laurence Fitzgibbon, when he came to hear\r\nthis, "that fellow\'ll marry an heiress, and be Secretary for Oireland\r\nyet." A good deal was said about it to Phineas at the clubs, but a\r\nword or two that was said to him by Violet Effingham was worth all\r\nthe rest. "Why, what a Paladin you are! But you succour men in\r\ndistress instead of maidens." "That\'s my bad luck," said Phineas.\r\n"The other will come no doubt in time," Violet replied; "and then\r\nyou\'ll get your reward." He knew that such words from a girl mean\r\nnothing,--especially from such a girl as Violet Effingham; but\r\nnevertheless they were very pleasant to him.\r\n\r\n"Of course you will come to us at Loughlinter when Parliament is up?"\r\nLady Laura said the same day.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know really. You see I must go over to Ireland about my\r\nre-election."\r\n\r\n"What has that to do with it? You are only making out excuses. We\r\ngo down on the first of July, and the English elections won\'t begin\r\ntill the middle of the month. It will be August before the men of\r\nLoughshane are ready for you."\r\n\r\n"To tell you the truth, Lady Laura," said Phineas, "I doubt whether\r\nthe men of Loughshane,--or rather the man of Loughshane, will have\r\nanything more to say to me."\r\n\r\n"What man do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Lord Tulla. He was in a passion with his brother before, and I got\r\nthe advantage of it. Since that he has paid his brother\'s debts for\r\nthe fifteenth time, and of course is ready to fight any battle for\r\nthe forgiven prodigal. Things are not as they were, and my father\r\ntells me that he thinks I shall be beaten."\r\n\r\n"That is bad news."\r\n\r\n"It is what I have a right to expect."\r\n\r\nEvery word of information that had come to Phineas about Loughshane\r\nsince Mr. Mildmay had decided upon a dissolution, had gone towards\r\nmaking him feel at first that there was a great doubt as to his\r\nre-election, and at last that there was almost a certainty against\r\nhim. And as these tidings reached him they made him very unhappy.\r\nSince he had been in Parliament he had very frequently regretted\r\nthat he had left the shades of the Inns of Court for the glare of\r\nWestminster; and he had more than once made up his mind that he would\r\ndesert the glare and return to the shade. But now, when the moment\r\ncame in which such desertion seemed to be compulsory on him, when\r\nthere would be no longer a choice, the seat in Parliament was dearer\r\nto him than ever. If he had gone of his own free will,--so he told\r\nhimself,--there would have been something of nobility in such going.\r\nMr. Low would have respected him, and even Mrs. Low might have taken\r\nhim back to the friendship of her severe bosom. But he would go back\r\nnow as a cur with his tail between his legs,--kicked out, as it were,\r\nfrom Parliament. Returning to Lincoln\'s Inn soiled with failure,\r\nhaving accomplished nothing, having broken down on the only occasion\r\non which he had dared to show himself on his legs, not having opened\r\na single useful book during the two years in which he had sat in\r\nParliament, burdened with Laurence Fitzgibbon\'s debt, and not quite\r\nfree from debt of his own, how could he start himself in any way by\r\nwhich he might even hope to win success? He must, he told himself,\r\ngive up all thought of practising in London and betake himself to\r\nDublin. He could not dare to face his friends in London as a young\r\nbriefless barrister.\r\n\r\nOn this evening, the evening subsequent to that on which Mr. Kennedy\r\nhad been attacked, the House was sitting in Committee of Ways and\r\nMeans, and there came on a discussion as to a certain vote for the\r\narmy. It had been known that there would be such discussion; and Mr.\r\nMonk having heard from Phineas a word or two now and again about the\r\npotted peas, had recommended him to be ready with a few remarks if he\r\nwished to support the Government in the matter of that vote. Phineas\r\ndid so wish, having learned quite enough in the Committee Room\r\nup-stairs to make him believe that a large importation of the\r\npotted peas from Holstein would not be for the advantage of the\r\narmy or navy,--or for that of the country at large. Mr. Monk had\r\nmade his suggestion without the slightest allusion to the former\r\nfailure,--just as though Phineas were a practised speaker accustomed\r\nto be on his legs three or four times a week. "If I find a chance, I\r\nwill," said Phineas, taking the advice just as it was given.\r\n\r\nSoon after prayers, a word was said in the House as to the\r\nill-fortune which had befallen the new Cabinet Minister. Mr. Daubeny\r\nhad asked Mr. Mildmay whether violent hands had not been laid in the\r\ndead of night on the sacred throat,--the throat that should have been\r\nsacred,--of the new Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster; and had\r\nexpressed regret that the Ministry,--which was, he feared, in other\r\nrespects somewhat infirm,--should now have been further weakened by\r\nthis injury to that new bulwark with which it had endeavoured to\r\nsupport itself. The Prime Minister, answering his old rival in the\r\nsame strain, said that the calamity might have been very severe,\r\nboth to the country and to the Cabinet; but that fortunately for the\r\ncommunity at large, a gallant young member of that House,--and he was\r\nproud to say a supporter of the Government,--had appeared upon the\r\nspot at the nick of time;--"As a god out of a machine," said Mr.\r\nDaubeny, interrupting him;--"By no means as a god out of a machine,"\r\ncontinued Mr. Mildmay, "but as a real help in a very real trouble,\r\nand succeeded not only in saving my right honourable friend, the\r\nChancellor of the Duchy, but in arresting the two malefactors who\r\nattempted to rob him in the street." Then there was a cry of "name;"\r\nand Mr. Mildmay of course named the member for Loughshane. It so\r\nhappened that Phineas was not in the House, but he heard it all when\r\nhe came down to attend the Committee of Ways and Means.\r\n\r\nThen came on the discussion about provisions in the army, the subject\r\nbeing mooted by one of Mr. Turnbull\'s close allies. The gentleman\r\non the other side of the House who had moved for the Potted Peas\r\nCommittee, was silent on the occasion, having felt that the result\r\nof that committee had not been exactly what he had expected. The\r\nevidence respecting such of the Holstein potted peas as had been used\r\nin this country was not very favourable to them. But, nevertheless,\r\nthe rebound from that committee,--the very fact that such a committee\r\nhad been made to sit,--gave ground for a hostile attack. To attack\r\nis so easy, when a complete refutation barely suffices to save the\r\nMinister attacked,--does not suffice to save him from future dim\r\nmemories of something having been wrong,--and brings down no disgrace\r\nwhatsoever on the promoter of the false charge. The promoter of the\r\nfalse charge simply expresses his gratification at finding that he\r\nhad been misled by erroneous information. It is not customary for him\r\nto express gratification at the fact, that out of all the mud which\r\nhe has thrown, some will probably stick! Phineas, when the time came,\r\ndid get on his legs, and spoke perhaps two or three dozen words. The\r\ndoing so seemed to come to him quite naturally. He had thought very\r\nlittle about it beforehand,--having resolved not to think of it. And\r\nindeed the occasion was one of no great importance. The Speaker was\r\nnot in the chair, and the House was thin, and he intended to make no\r\nspeech,--merely to say something which he had to say. Till he had\r\nfinished he hardly remembered that he was doing that, in attempting\r\nto do which he had before failed so egregiously. It was not till he\r\nsat down that he began to ask himself whether the scene was swimming\r\nbefore his eyes as it had done on former occasions; as it had done\r\neven when he had so much as thought of making a speech. Now he was\r\nastonished at the easiness of the thing, and as he left the House\r\ntold himself that he had overcome the difficulty just when the\r\nvictory could be of no avail to him. Had he been more eager, more\r\nconstant in his purpose, he might at any rate have shown the world\r\nthat he was fit for the place which he had presumed to take before\r\nhe was cast out of it.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning he received a letter from his father. Dr. Finn\r\nhad seen Lord Tulla, having been sent for to relieve his lordship in\r\na fit of the gout, and had been informed by the Earl that he meant to\r\nfight the borough to the last man;--had he said to the last shilling\r\nhe would have spoken with perhaps more accuracy. "You see, doctor,\r\nyour son has had it for two years, as you may say for nothing, and I\r\nthink he ought to give way. He can\'t expect that he\'s to go on there\r\nas though it were his own." And then his lordship, upon whom this\r\ntouch of the gout had come somewhat sharply, expressed himself with\r\nconsiderable animation. The old doctor behaved with much spirit. "I\r\ntold the Earl," he said, "that I could not undertake to say what you\r\nmight do; but that as you had come forward at first with my sanction,\r\nI could not withdraw it now. He asked me if I should support you with\r\nmoney; I said that I should to a moderate extent. \'By G----,\' said\r\nthe Earl, \'a moderate extent will go a very little way, I can tell\r\nyou.\' Since that he has had Duggin with him; so, I suppose, I shall\r\nnot see him any more. You can do as you please now; but, from what I\r\nhear, I fear you will have no chance." Then with much bitterness of\r\nspirit Phineas resolved that he would not interfere with Lord Tulla\r\nat Loughshane. He would go at once to the Reform Club and explain his\r\nreasons to Barrington Erle and others there who would be interested.\r\n\r\nBut he first went to Grosvenor Place. Here he was shown up into Mr.\r\nKennedy\'s room. Mr. Kennedy was up and seated in an arm-chair by an\r\nopen window looking over into the Queen\'s garden; but he was in his\r\ndressing-gown, and was to be regarded as an invalid. And indeed as he\r\ncould not turn his neck, or thought that he could not do so, he was\r\nnot very fit to go out about his work. Let us hope that the affairs\r\nof the Duchy of Lancaster did not suffer materially by his absence.\r\nWe may take it for granted that with a man so sedulous as to all his\r\nduties there was no arrear of work when the accident took place. He\r\nput out his hand to Phineas, and said some word in a whisper,--some\r\nword or two among which Phineas caught the sound of "potted\r\npeas,"--and then continued to look out of the window. There are men\r\nwho are utterly prostrated by any bodily ailment, and it seemed that\r\nMr. Kennedy was one of them. Phineas, who was full of his own bad\r\nnews, had intended to tell his sad story at once. But he perceived\r\nthat the neck of the Chancellor of the Duchy was too stiff to allow\r\nof his taking any interest in external matters, and so he refrained.\r\n"What does the doctor say about it?" said Phineas, perceiving that\r\njust for the present there could be only one possible subject for\r\nremark. Mr. Kennedy was beginning to describe in a long whisper what\r\nthe doctor did think about it, when Lady Laura came into the room.\r\n\r\nOf course they began at first to talk about Mr. Kennedy. It would not\r\nhave been kind to him not to have done so. And Lady Laura made much\r\nof the injury, as it behoves a wife to do in such circumstances for\r\nthe sake both of the sufferer and of the hero. She declared her\r\nconviction that had Phineas been a moment later her husband\'s neck\r\nwould have been irredeemably broken.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think they ever do kill the people," said Phineas. "At any\r\nrate they don\'t mean to do so."\r\n\r\n"I thought they did," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"I fancy not," said Phineas, eager in the cause of truth.\r\n\r\n"I think this man was very clumsy," whispered Mr. Kennedy.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he was a beginner," said Phineas, "and that may make a\r\ndifference. If so, I\'m afraid we have interfered with his\r\neducation."\r\n\r\nThen, by degrees, the conversation got away to other things, and Lady\r\nLaura asked him after Loughshane. "I\'ve made up my mind to give it\r\nup," said he, smiling as he spoke.\r\n\r\n"I was afraid there was but a bad chance," said Lady Laura, smiling\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n"My father has behaved so well!" said Phineas. "He has written to say\r\nhe\'ll find the money, if I determine to contest the borough. I mean\r\nto write to him by to-night\'s post to decline the offer. I have no\r\nright to spend the money, and I shouldn\'t succeed if I did spend it.\r\nOf course it makes me a little down in the mouth." And then he smiled\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got a plan of my own," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"What plan?"\r\n\r\n"Or rather it isn\'t mine, but papa\'s. Old Mr. Standish is going to\r\ngive up Loughton, and papa wants you to come and try your luck\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"Lady Laura!"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t quite a certainty, you know, but I suppose it\'s as near a\r\ncertainty as anything left." And this came from a strong Radical\r\nReformer!\r\n\r\n"Lady Laura, I couldn\'t accept such a favour from your father." Then\r\nMr. Kennedy nodded his head very slightly and whispered, "Yes, yes."\r\n"I couldn\'t think of it," said Phineas Finn. "I have no right to such\r\na favour."\r\n\r\n"That is a matter entirely for papa\'s consideration," said Lady\r\nLaura, with an affectation of solemnity in her voice. "I think it has\r\nalways been felt that any politician may accept such an offer as that\r\nwhen it is made to him, but that no politician should ask for it. My\r\nfather feels that he has to do the best he can with his influence in\r\nthe borough, and therefore he comes to you."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t that," said Phineas, somewhat rudely.\r\n\r\n"Of course private feelings have their weight," said Lady Laura. "It\r\nis not probable that papa would have gone to a perfect stranger. And\r\nperhaps, Mr. Finn, I may own that Mr. Kennedy and I would both be\r\nvery sorry that you should not be in the House, and that that feeling\r\non our part has had some weight with my father."\r\n\r\n"Of course you\'ll stand?" whispered Mr. Kennedy, still looking\r\nstraight out of the window, as though the slightest attempt to turn\r\nhis neck would be fraught with danger to himself and the Duchy.\r\n\r\n"Papa has desired me to ask you to call upon him," said Lady Laura.\r\n"I don\'t suppose there is very much to be said, as each of you know\r\nso well the other\'s way of thinking. But you had better see him\r\nto-day or to-morrow."\r\n\r\nOf course Phineas was persuaded before he left Mr. Kennedy\'s room.\r\nIndeed, when he came to think of it, there appeared to him to be no\r\nvalid reason why he should not sit for Loughton. The favour was of\r\na kind that had prevailed from time out of mind in England, between\r\nthe most respectable of the great land magnates, and young rising\r\nliberal politicians. Burke, Fox, and Canning had all been placed in\r\nParliament by similar influence. Of course he, Phineas Finn, desired\r\nearnestly,--longed in his very heart of hearts,--to extinguish all\r\nsuch Parliamentary influence, to root out for ever the last vestige\r\nof close borough nominations; but while the thing remained it was\r\nbetter that the thing should contribute to the liberal than to the\r\nconservative strength of the House,--and if to the liberal, how was\r\nthis to be achieved but by the acceptance of such influence by some\r\nliberal candidate? And if it were right that it should be accepted\r\nby any liberal candidate,--then, why not by him? The logic of this\r\nargument seemed to him to be perfect. He felt something like a\r\nsting of reproach as he told himself that in truth this great offer\r\nwas made to him, not on account of the excellence of his politics,\r\nbut because he had been instrumental in saving Lord Brentford\'s\r\nson-in-law from the violence of garrotters. But he crushed these\r\nqualms of conscience as being over-scrupulous, and, as he told\r\nhimself, not practical. You must take the world as you find it,\r\nwith a struggle to be something more honest than those around you.\r\nPhineas, as he preached to himself this sermon, declared to himself\r\nthat they who attempted more than this flew too high in the clouds\r\nto be of service to men and women upon earth.\r\n\r\nAs he did not see Lord Brentford that day he postponed writing to his\r\nfather for twenty-four hours. On the following morning he found the\r\nEarl at home in Portman Square, having first discussed the matter\r\nfully with Lord Chiltern. "Do not scruple about me," said Lord\r\nChiltern; "you are quite welcome to the borough for me."\r\n\r\n"But if I did not stand, would you do so? There are so many reasons\r\nwhich ought to induce you to accept a seat in Parliament!"\r\n\r\n"Whether that be true or not, Phineas, I shall not accept my father\'s\r\ninterest at Loughton, unless it be offered to me in a way in which\r\nit never will be offered. You know me well enough to be sure that I\r\nshall not change my mind. Nor will he. And, therefore, you may go\r\ndown to Loughton with a pure conscience as far as I am concerned."\r\n\r\nPhineas had his interview with the Earl, and in ten minutes\r\neverything was settled. On his way to Portman Square there had come\r\nacross his mind the idea of a grand effort of friendship. What if he\r\ncould persuade the father so to conduct himself towards his son, that\r\nthe son should consent to be a member for the borough? And he did\r\nsay a word or two to this effect, setting forth that Lord Chiltern\r\nwould condescend to become a legislator, if only his father would\r\ncondescend to acknowledge his son\'s fitness for such work without\r\nany comments on the son\'s past life. But the Earl simply waived the\r\nsubject away with his hand. He could be as obstinate as his son. Lady\r\nLaura had been the Mercury between them on this subject, and Lady\r\nLaura had failed. He would not now consent to employ another Mercury.\r\nVery little,--hardly a word indeed,--was said between the Earl and\r\nPhineas about politics. Phineas was to be the Saulsby candidate at\r\nLoughton for the next election, and was to come to Saulsby with the\r\nKennedys from Loughlinter,--either with the Kennedys or somewhat in\r\nadvance of them. "I do not say that there will be no opposition,"\r\nsaid the Earl, "but I expect none." He was very courteous,--nay,\r\nhe was kind, feeling doubtless that his family owed a great debt\r\nof gratitude to the young man with whom he was conversing; but,\r\nnevertheless, there was not absent on his part a touch of that high\r\ncondescension which, perhaps, might be thought to become the Earl,\r\nthe Cabinet Minister, and the great borough patron. Phineas, who\r\nwas sensitive, felt this and winced. He had never quite liked Lord\r\nBrentford, and could not bring himself to do so now in spite of the\r\nkindness which the Earl was showing him.\r\n\r\nBut he was very happy when he sat down to write to his father\r\nfrom the club. His father had told him that the money should be\r\nforthcoming for the election at Loughshane, if he resolved to stand,\r\nbut that the chance of success would be very slight,--indeed that, in\r\nhis opinion, there would be no chance of success. Nevertheless, his\r\nfather had evidently believed, when writing, that Phineas would not\r\nabandon his seat without a useless and expensive contest. He now\r\nthanked his father with many expressions of gratitude,--declared his\r\nconviction that his father was right about Lord Tulla, and then,\r\nin the most modest language that he could use, went on to say that\r\nhe had found another borough open to him in England. He was going\r\nto stand for Loughton, with the assistance of Lord Brentford, and\r\nthought that the election would probably not cost him above a couple\r\nof hundred pounds at the outside. Then he wrote a very pretty note\r\nto Lord Tulla, thanking him for his former kindness, and telling\r\nthe Irish Earl that it was not his intention to interfere with the\r\nborough of Loughshane at the next election.\r\n\r\nA few days after this Phineas was very much surprised at a visit\r\nthat was made to him at his lodgings. Mr. Clarkson, after that\r\nscene in the lobby of the House, called again in Great Marlborough\r\nStreet,--and was admitted. "You had better let him sit in your\r\narmchair for half an hour or so," Fitzgibbon had said; and Phineas\r\nalmost believed that it would be better. The man was a terrible\r\nnuisance to him, and he was beginning to think that he had better\r\nundertake to pay the debt by degrees. It was, he knew, quite on the\r\ncards that Mr. Clarkson should have him arrested while at Saulsby.\r\nSince that scene in the lobby Mr. Clarkson had been with him twice,\r\nand there had been a preliminary conversation as to real payment.\r\nMr. Clarkson wanted a hundred pounds down, and another bill for two\r\nhundred and twenty at three months\' date. "Think of my time and\r\ntrouble in coming here," Mr. Clarkson had urged when Phineas had\r\nobjected to these terms. "Think of my time and trouble, and do be\r\npunctual, Mr. Finn." Phineas had offered him ten pounds a quarter,\r\nthe payments to be marked on the back of the bill, a tender which Mr.\r\nClarkson had not seemed to regard as strong evidence of punctuality.\r\nHe had not been angry, but had simply expressed his intention of\r\ncalling again,--giving Phineas to understand that business would\r\nprobably take him to the west of Ireland in the autumn. If only\r\nbusiness might not take him down either to Loughlinter or to Saulsby!\r\nBut the strange visitor who came to Phineas in the midst of these\r\ntroubles put an end to them all.\r\n\r\nThe strange visitor was Miss Aspasia Fitzgibbon. "You\'ll be very much\r\nsurprised at my coming to your chambers, no doubt," she said, as she\r\nsat down in the chair which Phineas placed for her. Phineas could\r\nonly say that he was very proud to be so highly honoured, and that he\r\nhoped she was well. "Pretty well, I thank you. I have just come about\r\na little business, Mr. Finn, and I hope you\'ll excuse me."\r\n\r\n"I\'m quite sure that there is no need for excuses," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Laurence, when he hears about it, will say that I\'ve been an\r\nimpertinent old fool; but I never care what Laurence says, either\r\nthis way or that. I\'ve been to that Mr. Clarkson, Mr. Finn, and I\'ve\r\npaid him the money."\r\n\r\n"No!" said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"But I have, Mr. Finn. I happened to hear what occurred that night at\r\nthe door of the House of Commons."\r\n\r\n"Who told you, Miss Fitzgibbon?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind who told me. I heard it. I knew before that you had been\r\nfoolish enough to help Laurence about money, and so I put two and two\r\ntogether. It isn\'t the first time I have had to do with Mr. Clarkson.\r\nSo I sent to him, and I\'ve bought the bill. There it is." And Miss\r\nFitzgibbon produced the document which bore the name of Phineas Finn\r\nacross the front of it.\r\n\r\n"And did you pay him two hundred and fifty pounds for it?"\r\n\r\n"Not quite. I had a very hard tussle, and got it at last for two\r\nhundred and twenty pounds."\r\n\r\n"And did you do it yourself?"\r\n\r\n"All myself. If I had employed a lawyer I should have had to pay\r\ntwo hundred and forty pounds and five pounds for costs. And now,\r\nMr. Finn, I hope you won\'t have any more money engagements with my\r\nbrother Laurence." Phineas said that he thought he might promise that\r\nhe would have no more. "Because, if you do, I shan\'t interfere. If\r\nLaurence began to find that he could get money out of me in that way,\r\nthere would be no end to it. Mr. Clarkson would very soon be spending\r\nhis spare time in my drawing-room. Good-bye, Mr. Finn. If Laurence\r\nsays anything, just tell him that he\'d better come to me." Then\r\nPhineas was left looking at the bill. It was certainly a great relief\r\nto him,--that he should be thus secured from the domiciliary visits\r\nof Mr. Clarkson; a great relief to him to be assured that Mr.\r\nClarkson would not find him out down at Loughton; but nevertheless,\r\nhe had to suffer a pang of shame as he felt that Miss Fitzgibbon had\r\nbecome acquainted with his poverty and had found herself obliged to\r\nsatisfy his pecuniary liabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nLady Laura Kennedy\'s Headache\r\n\r\n\r\nPhineas went down to Loughlinter early in July, taking Loughton in\r\nhis way. He stayed there one night at the inn, and was introduced to\r\nsundry influential inhabitants of the borough by Mr. Grating, the\r\nironmonger, who was known by those who knew Loughton to be a very\r\nstrong supporter of the Earl\'s interest. Mr. Grating and about half a\r\ndozen others of the tradesmen of the town came to the inn, and met\r\nPhineas in the parlour. He told them he was a good sound Liberal and\r\na supporter of Mr. Mildmay\'s Government, of which their neighbour the\r\nEarl was so conspicuous an ornament. This was almost all that was\r\nsaid about the Earl out loud; but each individual man of Loughton\r\nthen present took an opportunity during the meeting of whispering\r\ninto Mr. Finn\'s ear a word or two to show that he also was admitted\r\nto the secret councils of the borough,--that he too could see the\r\ninside of the arrangement. "Of course we must support the Earl," one\r\nsaid. "Never mind what you hear about a Tory candidate, Mr. Finn,"\r\nwhispered a second; "the Earl can do what he pleases here." And it\r\nseemed to Phineas that it was thought by them all to be rather a fine\r\nthing to be thus held in the hand by an English nobleman. Phineas\r\ncould not but reflect much upon this as he lay in his bed at the\r\nLoughton inn. The great political question on which the political\r\nworld was engrossed up in London was the enfranchisement of\r\nEnglishmen,--of Englishmen down to the rank of artisans and\r\nlabourers;--and yet when he found himself in contact with individual\r\nEnglishmen, with men even very much above the artisan and the\r\nlabourer, he found that they rather liked being bound hand and foot,\r\nand being kept as tools in the political pocket of a rich man.\r\nEvery one of those Loughton tradesmen was proud of his own personal\r\nsubjection to the Earl!\r\n\r\nFrom Loughton he went to Loughlinter, having promised to be back in\r\nthe borough for the election. Mr. Grating would propose him, and he\r\nwas to be seconded by Mr. Shortribs, the butcher and grazier. Mention\r\nhad been made of a Conservative candidate, and Mr. Shortribs had\r\nseemed to think that a good stand-up fight upon English principles,\r\nwith a clear understanding, of course, that victory should prevail\r\non the liberal side, would be a good thing for the borough. But the\r\nEarl\'s man of business saw Phineas on the morning of his departure,\r\nand told him not to regard Mr. Shortribs. "They\'d all like it," said\r\nthe man of business; "and I daresay they\'ll have enough of it when\r\nthis Reform Bill is passed; but at present no one will be fool enough\r\nto come and spend his money here. We have them all in hand too well\r\nfor that, Mr. Finn!"\r\n\r\nHe found the great house at Loughlinter nearly empty. Mr. Kennedy\'s\r\nmother was there, and Lord Brentford was there, and Lord Brentford\'s\r\nprivate secretary, and Mr. Kennedy\'s private secretary. At present\r\nthat was the entire party. Lady Baldock was expected there, with\r\nher daughter and Violet Effingham; but, as well as Phineas could\r\nlearn, they would not be at Loughlinter until after he had left it.\r\nThere had come up lately a rumour that there would be an autumn\r\nsession,--that the Houses would sit through October and a part of\r\nNovember, in order that Mr. Mildmay might try the feeling of the new\r\nParliament. If this were to be so, Phineas had resolved that, in the\r\nevent of his election at Loughton, he would not return to Ireland\r\ntill after this autumn session should be over. He gave an account to\r\nthe Earl, in the presence of the Earl\'s son-in-law, of what had taken\r\nplace at Loughton, and the Earl expressed himself as satisfied. It\r\nwas manifestly a great satisfaction to Lord Brentford that he should\r\nstill have a borough in his pocket, and the more so because there\r\nwere so very few noblemen left who had such property belonging to\r\nthem. He was very careful in his speech, never saying in so many\r\nwords that the privilege of returning a member was his own; but his\r\nmeaning was not the less clear.\r\n\r\nThose were dreary days at Loughlinter. There was fishing,--if Phineas\r\nchose to fish; and he was told that he could shoot a deer if he was\r\nminded to go out alone. But it seemed as though it were the intention\r\nof the host that his guests should spend their time profitably. Mr.\r\nKennedy himself was shut up with books and papers all the morning,\r\nand always took up a book after dinner. The Earl also would read a\r\nlittle,--and then would sleep a good deal. Old Mrs. Kennedy slept\r\nalso, and Lady Laura looked as though she would like to sleep if\r\nit were not that her husband\'s eye was upon her. As it was, she\r\nadministered tea, Mr. Kennedy not liking the practice of having it\r\nhanded round by a servant when none were there but members of the\r\nfamily circle, and she read novels. Phineas got hold of a stiff bit\r\nof reading for himself, and tried to utilise his time. He took Alison\r\nin hand, and worked his way gallantly through a couple of volumes.\r\nBut even he, more than once or twice, found himself on the very verge\r\nof slumber. Then he would wake up and try to think about things. Why\r\nwas he, Phineas Finn, an Irishman from Killaloe, living in that great\r\nhouse of Loughlinter as though he were one of the family, striving to\r\nkill the hours, and feeling that he was in some way subject to the\r\ndominion of his host? Would it not be better for him to get up and go\r\naway? In his heart of hearts he did not like Mr. Kennedy, though he\r\nbelieved him to be a good man. And of what service to him was it to\r\nlike Lady Laura, now that Lady Laura was a possession in the hands of\r\nMr. Kennedy? Then he would tell himself that he owed his position in\r\nthe world entirely to Lady Laura, and that he was ungrateful to feel\r\nhimself ever dull in her society. And, moreover, there was something\r\nto be done in the world beyond making love and being merry. Mr.\r\nKennedy could occupy himself with a blue book for hours together\r\nwithout wincing. So Phineas went to work again with his Alison, and\r\nread away till he nodded.\r\n\r\nIn those days he often wandered up and down the Linter and across the\r\nmoor to the Linn, and so down to the lake. He would take a book with\r\nhim, and would seat himself down on spots which he loved, and would\r\npretend to read;--but I do not think that he got much advantage\r\nfrom his book. He was thinking of his life, and trying to calculate\r\nwhether the wonderful success which he had achieved would ever be of\r\npermanent value to him. Would he be nearer to earning his bread when\r\nhe should be member for Loughton than he had been when he was member\r\nfor Loughshane? Or was there before him any slightest probability\r\nthat he would ever earn his bread? And then he thought of Violet\r\nEffingham, and was angry with himself for remembering at that moment\r\nthat Violet Effingham was the mistress of a large fortune.\r\n\r\nOnce before when he was sitting beside the Linter he had made up his\r\nmind to declare his passion to Lady Laura;--and he had done so on the\r\nvery spot. Now, within a twelvemonth of that time, he made up his\r\nmind on the same spot to declare his passion to Miss Effingham, and\r\nhe thought his best mode of carrying his suit would be to secure the\r\nassistance of Lady Laura. Lady Laura, no doubt, had been very anxious\r\nthat her brother should marry Violet; but Lord Chiltern, as Phineas\r\nknew, had asked for Violet\'s hand twice in vain; and, moreover,\r\nChiltern himself had declared to Phineas that he would never ask\r\nfor it again. Lady Laura, who was always reasonable, would surely\r\nperceive that there was no hope of success for her brother. That\r\nChiltern would quarrel with him,--would quarrel with him to the\r\nknife,--he did not doubt; but he felt that no fear of such a quarrel\r\nas that should deter him. He loved Violet Effingham, and he must\r\nindeed be pusillanimous if, loving her as he did, he was deterred\r\nfrom expressing his love from any fear of a suitor whom she did not\r\nfavour. He would not willingly be untrue to his friendship for Lady\r\nLaura\'s brother. Had there been a chance for Lord Chiltern he would\r\nhave abstained from putting himself forward. But what was the use\r\nof his abstaining, when by doing so he could in no wise benefit\r\nhis friend,--when the result of his doing so would be that some\r\ninterloper would come in and carry off the prize? He would explain\r\nall this to Lady Laura, and, if the prize would be kind to him, he\r\nwould disregard the anger of Lord Chiltern, even though it might be\r\nanger to the knife.\r\n\r\nAs he was thinking of all this Lady Laura stood before him where he\r\nwas sitting at the top of the falls. At this moment he remembered\r\nwell all the circumstances of the scene when he had been there with\r\nher at his last visit to Loughlinter. How things had changed since\r\nthen! Then he had loved Lady Laura with all his heart, and he had now\r\nalready brought himself to regard her as a discreet matron whom to\r\nlove would be almost as unreasonable as though he were to entertain\r\na passion for the Lord Chancellor. The reader will understand how\r\nthorough had been the cure effected by Lady Laura\'s marriage and the\r\ninterval of a few months, when the swain was already prepared to make\r\nthis lady the depositary of his confidence in another matter of love.\r\n"You are often here, I suppose?" said Lady Laura, looking down upon\r\nhim as he sat upon the rock.\r\n\r\n"Well;--yes; not very often; I come here sometimes because the view\r\ndown upon the lake is so fine."\r\n\r\n"It is the prettiest spot about the place. I hardly ever get here\r\nnow. Indeed this is only the second time that I have been up since\r\nwe have been at home, and then I came to bring papa here." There was\r\na little wooden seat near to the rock upon which Phineas had been\r\nlying, and upon this Lady Laura sat down. Phineas, with his eyes\r\nturned upon the lake, was considering how he might introduce the\r\nsubject of his love for Violet Effingham; but he did not find the\r\nmatter very easy. He had just resolved to begin by saying that Violet\r\nwould certainly never accept Lord Chiltern, when Lady Laura spoke a\r\nword or two which stopped him altogether. "How well I remember," she\r\nsaid, "the day when you and I were here last autumn!"\r\n\r\n"So do I. You told me then that you were going to marry Mr. Kennedy.\r\nHow much has happened since then!"\r\n\r\n"Much indeed! Enough for a whole lifetime. And yet how slow the time\r\nhas gone!"\r\n\r\n"I do not think it has been slow with me," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"No; you have been active. You have had your hands full of work. I\r\nam beginning to think that it is a great curse to have been born a\r\nwoman."\r\n\r\n"And yet I have heard you say that a woman may do as much as a man."\r\n\r\n"That was before I had learned my lesson properly. I know better than\r\nthat now. Oh dear! I have no doubt it is all for the best as it is,\r\nbut I have a kind of wish that I might be allowed to go out and milk\r\nthe cows."\r\n\r\n"And may you not milk the cows if you wish it, Lady Laura?"\r\n\r\n"By no means;--not only not milk them, but hardly look at them. At\r\nany rate, I must not talk about them." Phineas of course understood\r\nthat she was complaining of her husband, and hardly knew how to reply\r\nto her. He had been sharp enough to perceive already that Mr. Kennedy\r\nwas an autocrat in his own house, and he knew Lady Laura well enough\r\nto be sure that such masterdom would be very irksome to her. But he\r\nhad not imagined that she would complain to him. "It was so different\r\nat Saulsby," Lady Laura continued. "Everything there seemed to be my\r\nown."\r\n\r\n"And everything here is your own."\r\n\r\n"Yes,--according to the prayer-book. And everything in truth is my\r\nown,--as all the dainties at the banquet belonged to Sancho the\r\nGovernor."\r\n\r\n"You mean," said he,--and then he hesitated; "you mean that Mr.\r\nKennedy stands over you, guarding you for your own welfare, as the\r\ndoctor stood over Sancho and guarded him?"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause before she answered,--a long pause, during which he\r\nwas looking away over the lake, and thinking how he might introduce\r\nthe subject of his love. But long as was the pause, he had not begun\r\nwhen Lady Laura was again speaking. "The truth is, my friend," she\r\nsaid, "that I have made a mistake."\r\n\r\n"A mistake?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Phineas, a mistake. I have blundered as fools blunder, thinking\r\nthat I was clever enough to pick my footsteps aright without asking\r\ncounsel from any one. I have blundered and stumbled and fallen, and\r\nnow I am so bruised that I am not able to stand upon my feet." The\r\nword that struck him most in all this was his own Christian name. She\r\nhad never called him Phineas before. He was aware that the circle\r\nof his acquaintance had fallen into a way of miscalling him by his\r\nChristian name, as one observes to be done now and again in reference\r\nto some special young man. Most of the men whom he called his friends\r\ncalled him Phineas. Even the Earl had done so more than once on\r\noccasions in which the greatness of his position had dropped for a\r\nmoment out of his mind. Mrs. Low had called him Phineas when she\r\nregarded him as her husband\'s most cherished pupil; and Mrs. Bunce\r\nhad called him Mr. Phineas. He had always been Phineas to everybody\r\nat Killaloe. But still he was quite sure that Lady Laura had never so\r\ncalled him before. Nor would she have done so now in her husband\'s\r\npresence. He was sure of that also.\r\n\r\n"You mean that you are unhappy?" he said, still looking away from her\r\ntowards the lake.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do mean that. Though I do not know why I should come and tell\r\nyou so,--except that I am still blundering and stumbling, and have\r\nfallen into a way of hurting myself at every step."\r\n\r\n"You can tell no one who is more anxious for your happiness," said\r\nPhineas.\r\n\r\n"That is a very pretty speech, but what would you do for my\r\nhappiness? Indeed, what is it possible that you should do? I mean it\r\nas no rebuke when I say that my happiness or unhappiness is a matter\r\nas to which you will soon become perfectly indifferent."\r\n\r\n"Why should you say so, Lady Laura?"\r\n\r\n"Because it is natural that it should be so. You and Mr. Kennedy\r\nmight have been friends. Not that you will be, because you are unlike\r\neach other in all your ways. But it might have been so."\r\n\r\n"And are not you and I to be friends?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"No. In a very few months you will not think of telling me what are\r\nyour desires or what your sorrows;--and as for me, it will be out\r\nof the question that I should tell mine to you. How can you be my\r\nfriend?"\r\n\r\n"If you were not quite sure of my friendship, Lady Laura, you would\r\nnot speak to me as you are speaking now." Still he did not look at\r\nher, but lay with his face supported on his hands, and his eyes\r\nturned away upon the lake. But she, where she was sitting, could see\r\nhim, and was aided by her sight in making comparisons in her mind\r\nbetween the two men who had been her lovers,--between him whom she\r\nhad taken and him whom she had left. There was something in the hard,\r\ndry, unsympathising, unchanging virtues of her husband which almost\r\nrevolted her. He had not a fault, but she had tried him at every\r\npoint and had been able to strike no spark of fire from him. Even by\r\ndisobeying she could produce no heat,--only an access of firmness.\r\nHow would it have been with her had she thrown all ideas of fortune\r\nto the winds, and linked her lot to that of the young Phoebus who\r\nwas lying at her feet? If she had ever loved any one she had loved\r\nhim. And she had not thrown away her love for money. So she swore to\r\nherself over and over again, trying to console herself in her cold\r\nunhappiness. She had married a rich man in order that she might be\r\nable to do something in the world;--and now that she was this rich\r\nman\'s wife she found that she could do nothing. The rich man thought\r\nit to be quite enough for her to sit at home and look after his\r\nwelfare. In the meantime young Phoebus,--her Phoebus as he had\r\nbeen once,--was thinking altogether of some one else.\r\n\r\n"Phineas," she said, slowly, "I have in you such perfect confidence\r\nthat I will tell you the truth;--as one man may tell it to another. I\r\nwish you would go from here."\r\n\r\n"What, at once?"\r\n\r\n"Not to-day, or to-morrow. Stay here now till the election; but do\r\nnot return. He will ask you to come, and press you hard, and will be\r\nhurt;--for, strange to say, with all his coldness, he really likes\r\nyou. He has a pleasure in seeing you here. But he must not have that\r\npleasure at the expense of trouble to me."\r\n\r\n"And why is it a trouble to you?" he asked. Men are such fools;--so\r\nawkward, so unready, with their wits ever behind the occasion by a\r\ndozen seconds or so! As soon as the words were uttered, he knew that\r\nthey should not have been spoken.\r\n\r\n"Because I am a fool," she said. "Why else? Is not that enough for\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"Laura--," he said.\r\n\r\n"No,--no; I will have none of that. I am a fool, but not such a fool\r\nas to suppose that any cure is to be found there."\r\n\r\n"Only say what I can do for you, though it be with my entire life,\r\nand I will do it."\r\n\r\n"You can do nothing,--except to keep away from me."\r\n\r\n"Are you earnest in telling me that?" Now at last he had turned\r\nhimself round and was looking at her, and as he looked he saw the hat\r\nof a man appearing up the path, and immediately afterwards the face.\r\nIt was the hat and face of the laird of Loughlinter. "Here is Mr.\r\nKennedy," said Phineas, in a tone of voice not devoid of dismay and\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n"So I perceive," said Lady Laura. But there was no dismay or trouble\r\nin the tone of her voice.\r\n\r\nIn the countenance of Mr. Kennedy, as he approached closer, there was\r\nnot much to be read,--only, perhaps, some slight addition of gloom,\r\nor rather, perhaps, of that frigid propriety of moral demeanour for\r\nwhich he had always been conspicuous, which had grown upon him at his\r\nmarriage, and which had been greatly increased by the double action\r\nof being made a Cabinet Minister and being garrotted. "I am glad that\r\nyour headache is better," he said to his wife, who had risen from\r\nher seat to meet him. Phineas also had risen, and was now looking\r\nsomewhat sheepish where he stood.\r\n\r\n"I came out because it was worse," she said. "It irritated me so that\r\nI could not stand the house any longer."\r\n\r\n"I will send to Callender for Dr. Macnuthrie."\r\n\r\n"Pray do nothing of the kind, Robert. I do not want Dr. Macnuthrie at\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"Where there is illness, medical advice is always expedient."\r\n\r\n"I am not ill. A headache is not illness."\r\n\r\n"I had thought it was," said Mr. Kennedy, very drily.\r\n\r\n"At any rate, I would rather not have Dr. Macnuthrie."\r\n\r\n"I am sure it cannot do you any good to climb up here in the heat of\r\nthe sun. Had you been here long, Finn?"\r\n\r\n"All the morning;--here, or hereabouts. I clambered up from the lake\r\nand had a book in my pocket."\r\n\r\n"And you happened to come across him by accident?" Mr. Kennedy\r\nasked. There was something so simple in the question that its very\r\nsimplicity proved that there was no suspicion.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--by chance," said Lady Laura. "But every one at Loughlinter\r\nalways comes up here. If any one ever were missing whom I wanted to\r\nfind, this is where I should look."\r\n\r\n"I am going on towards Linter forest to meet Blane," said Mr.\r\nKennedy. Blane was the gamekeeper. "If you don\'t mind the trouble,\r\nFinn, I wish you\'d take Lady Laura down to the house. Do not let her\r\nstay out in the heat. I will take care that somebody goes over to\r\nCallender for Dr. Macnuthrie." Then Mr. Kennedy went on, and Phineas\r\nwas left with the charge of taking Lady Laura back to the house. When\r\nMr. Kennedy\'s hat had first appeared coming up the walk, Phineas\r\nhad been ready to proclaim himself prepared for any devotion in the\r\nservice of Lady Laura. Indeed, he had begun to reply with criminal\r\ntenderness to the indiscreet avowal which Lady Laura had made to\r\nhim. But he felt now, after what had just occurred in the husband\'s\r\npresence, that any show of tenderness,--of criminal tenderness,--was\r\nimpossible. The absence of all suspicion on the part of Mr. Kennedy\r\nhad made Phineas feel that he was bound by all social laws to refrain\r\nfrom such tenderness. Lady Laura began to descend the path before\r\nhim without a word;--and went on, and on, as though she would have\r\nreached the house without speaking, had he not addressed her. "Does\r\nyour head still pain you?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Of course it does."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he is right in saying that you should not be out in the\r\nheat."\r\n\r\n"I do not know. It is not worth while to think about that. He sends\r\nme in, and so of course I must go. And he tells you to take me, and\r\nso of course you must take me."\r\n\r\n"Would you wish that I should let you go alone?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I would. Only he will be sure to find it out; and you must not\r\ntell him that you left me at my request."\r\n\r\n"Do you think that I am afraid of him?" said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I think you are. I know that I am, and that papa is; and that\r\nhis mother hardly dares to call her soul her own. I do not know why\r\nyou should escape."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Kennedy is nothing to me."\r\n\r\n"He is something to me, and so I suppose I had better go on. And\r\nnow I shall have that horrid man from the little town pawing me\r\nand covering everything with snuff, and bidding me take Scotch\r\nphysic,--which seems to increase in quantity and nastiness as doses\r\nin England decrease. And he will stand over me to see that I take\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"What;--the doctor from Callender?"\r\n\r\n"No;--but Mr. Kennedy will. If he advised me to have a hole in my\r\nglove mended, he would ask me before he went to bed whether it was\r\ndone. He never forgot anything in his life, and was never unmindful\r\nof anything. That I think will do, Mr. Finn. You have brought me out\r\nfrom the trees, and that may be taken as bringing me home. We shall\r\nhardly get scolded if we part here. Remember what I told you up\r\nabove. And remember also that it is in your power to do nothing else\r\nfor me. Good-bye." So he turned away towards the lake, and let Lady\r\nLaura go across the wide lawn to the house by herself.\r\n\r\nHe had failed altogether in his intention of telling his friend of\r\nhis love for Violet, and had come to perceive that he could not for\r\nthe present carry out that intention. After what had passed it would\r\nbe impossible for him to go to Lady Laura with a passionate tale of\r\nhis longing for Violet Effingham. If he were even to speak to her of\r\nlove at all, it must be quite of another love than that. But he never\r\nwould speak to her of love; nor,--as he felt quite sure,--would she\r\nallow him to do so. But what astounded him most as he thought of the\r\ninterview which had just passed, was the fact that the Lady Laura\r\nwhom he had known,--whom he had thought he had known,--should have\r\nbecome so subject to such a man as Mr. Kennedy, a man whom he had\r\ndespised as being weak, irresolute, and without a purpose! For the\r\nday or two that he remained at Loughlinter, he watched the family\r\nclosely, and became aware that Lady Laura had been right when she\r\ndeclared that her father was afraid of Mr. Kennedy.\r\n\r\n"I shall follow you almost immediately," said the Earl confidentially\r\nto Phineas, when the candidate for the borough took his departure\r\nfrom Loughlinter. "I don\'t like to be there just when the election is\r\ngoing on, but I\'ll be at Saulsby to receive you the day afterwards."\r\n\r\nPhineas took his leave from Mr. Kennedy, with a warm expression of\r\nfriendship on the part of his host, and from Lady Laura with a mere\r\ntouch of the hand. He tried to say a word; but she was sullen, or, if\r\nnot, she put on some mood like to sullenness, and said never a word\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nOn the day after the departure of Phineas Finn for Loughton Lady\r\nLaura Kennedy still had a headache. She had complained of a headache\r\never since she had been at Loughlinter, and Dr. Macnuthrie had been\r\nover more than once. "I wonder what it is that ails you," said her\r\nhusband, standing over her in her own sitting-room up-stairs. It was\r\na pretty room, looking away to the mountains, with just a glimpse of\r\nthe lake to be caught from the window, and it had been prepared for\r\nher with all the skill and taste of an accomplished upholsterer. She\r\nhad selected the room for herself soon after her engagement, and had\r\nthanked her future husband with her sweetest smile for giving her\r\nthe choice. She had thanked him and told him that she always meant\r\nto be happy,--so happy in that room! He was a man not much given to\r\nromance, but he thought of this promise as he stood over her and\r\nasked after her health. As far as he could see she had never been\r\neven comfortable since she had been at Loughlinter. A shadow of the\r\ntruth came across his mind. Perhaps his wife was bored. If so, what\r\nwas to be the future of his life and of hers? He went up to London\r\nevery year, and to Parliament, as a duty; and then, during some\r\nperiod of the recess, would have his house full of guests,--as\r\nanother duty. But his happiness was to consist in such hours as these\r\nwhich seemed to inflict upon his wife the penalty of a continual\r\nheadache. A shadow of the truth came upon him. What if his wife did\r\nnot like living quietly at home as the mistress of her husband\'s\r\nhouse? What if a headache was always to be the result of a simple\r\nperformance of domestic duties?\r\n\r\nMore than a shadow of truth had come upon Lady Laura herself.\r\nThe dark cloud created by the entire truth was upon her, making\r\neverything black and wretched around her. She had asked herself a\r\nquestion or two, and had discovered that she had no love for her\r\nhusband, that the kind of life which he intended to exact from her\r\nwas insupportable to her, and that she had blundered and fallen in\r\nher entrance upon life. She perceived that her father had already\r\nbecome weary of Mr. Kennedy, and that, lonely and sad as he would\r\nbe at Saulsby by himself, it was his intention to repudiate the\r\nidea of making a home at Loughlinter. Yes;--she would be deserted by\r\neveryone, except of course by her husband; and then-- Then she would\r\nthrow herself on some early morning into the lake, for life would be\r\ninsupportable.\r\n\r\n"I wonder what it is that ails you," said Mr. Kennedy.\r\n\r\n"Nothing serious. One can\'t always help having a headache, you know."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you take enough exercise, Laura. I would propose that\r\nyou should walk four miles every day after breakfast. I will always\r\nbe ready to accompany you. I have spoken to Dr. Macnuthrie--"\r\n\r\n"I hate Dr. Macnuthrie."\r\n\r\n"Why should you hate Dr. Macnuthrie, Laura?"\r\n\r\n"How can I tell why? I do. That is quite reason enough why you should\r\nnot send for him to me."\r\n\r\n"You are unreasonable, Laura. One chooses a doctor on account of\r\nhis reputation in his profession, and that of Dr. Macnuthrie stands\r\nhigh."\r\n\r\n"I do not want any doctor."\r\n\r\n"But if you are ill, my dear--"\r\n\r\n"I am not ill."\r\n\r\n"But you said you had a headache. You have said so for the last ten\r\ndays."\r\n\r\n"Having a headache is not being ill. I only wish you would not talk\r\nof it, and then perhaps I should get rid of it."\r\n\r\n"I cannot believe that. Headache in nine cases out of ten comes from\r\nthe stomach." Though he said this,--saying it because it was the\r\ncommon-place common-sense sort of thing to say, still at the very\r\nmoment there was the shadow of the truth before his eyes. What if\r\nthis headache meant simple dislike to him, and to his modes of life?\r\n\r\n"It is nothing of that sort," said Lady Laura, impatient at having\r\nher ailment inquired into with so much accuracy.\r\n\r\n"Then what is it? You cannot think that I can be happy to hear you\r\ncomplaining of headache every day,--making it an excuse for absolute\r\nidleness."\r\n\r\n"What is it that you want me to do?" she said, jumping up from her\r\nseat. "Set me a task, and if I don\'t go mad over it, I\'ll get through\r\nit. There are the account books. Give them to me. I don\'t suppose I\r\ncan see the figures, but I\'ll try to see them."\r\n\r\n"Laura, this is unkind of you,--and ungrateful."\r\n\r\n"Of course;--it is everything that is bad. What a pity that you did\r\nnot find it out last year! Oh dear, oh dear! what am I to do?" Then\r\nshe threw herself down upon the sofa, and put both her hands up to\r\nher temples.\r\n\r\n"I will send for Dr. Macnuthrie at once," said Mr. Kennedy, walking\r\ntowards the door very slowly, and speaking as slowly as he walked.\r\n\r\n"No;--do no such thing," she said, springing to her feet again and\r\nintercepting him before he reached the door. "If he comes I will not\r\nsee him. I give you my word that I will not speak to him if he comes.\r\nYou do not understand," she said; "you do not understand at all."\r\n\r\n"What is it that I ought to understand?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"That a woman does not like to be bothered."\r\n\r\nHe made no reply at once, but stood there twisting the handle of the\r\ndoor, and collecting his thoughts. "Yes," said he at last; "I am\r\nbeginning to find that out;--and to find out also what it is that\r\nbothers a woman, as you call it. I can see now what it is that makes\r\nyour head ache. It is not the stomach. You are quite right there. It\r\nis the prospect of a quiet decent life, to which would be attached\r\nthe performance of certain homely duties. Dr. Macnuthrie is a learned\r\nman, but I doubt whether he can do anything for such a malady."\r\n\r\n"You are quite right, Robert; he can do nothing."\r\n\r\n"It is a malady you must cure for yourself, Laura;--and which is to\r\nbe cured by perseverance. If you can bring yourself to try--"\r\n\r\n"But I cannot bring myself to try at all," she said.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to tell me, Laura, that you will make no effort to do\r\nyour duty as my wife?"\r\n\r\n"I mean to tell you that I will not try to cure a headache by doing\r\nsums. That is all that I mean to say at this moment. If you will\r\nleave me for awhile, so that I may lie down, perhaps I shall be able\r\nto come to dinner." He still hesitated, standing with the door in his\r\nhand. "But if you go on scolding me," she continued, "what I shall\r\ndo is to go to bed directly you go away." He hesitated for a moment\r\nlonger, and then left the room without another word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nMr. Slide\'s Grievance\r\n\r\n\r\nOur hero was elected member for Loughton without any trouble to him\r\nor, as far as he could see, to any one else. He made one speech from\r\na small raised booth that was called a platform, and that was all\r\nthat he was called upon to do. Mr. Grating made a speech in proposing\r\nhim, and Mr. Shortribs another in seconding him; and these were all\r\nthe speeches that were required. The thing seemed to be so very easy\r\nthat he was afterwards almost offended when he was told that the bill\r\nfor so insignificant a piece of work came to L247 13s. 9d. He had\r\nseen no occasion for spending even the odd forty-seven pounds. But\r\nthen he was member for Loughton; and as he passed the evening alone\r\nat the inn, having dined in company with Messrs. Grating, Shortribs,\r\nand sundry other influential electors, he began to reflect that,\r\nafter all, it was not so very great a thing to be a member of\r\nParliament. It almost seemed that that which had come to him so\r\neasily could not be of much value.\r\n\r\nOn the following day he went to the castle, and was there when the\r\nEarl arrived. They two were alone together, and the Earl was very\r\nkind to him. "So you had no opponent after all," said the great man\r\nof Loughton, with a slight smile.\r\n\r\n"Not the ghost of another candidate."\r\n\r\n"I did not think there would be. They have tried it once or twice and\r\nhave always failed. There are only one or two in the place who like\r\nto go one way just because their neighbours go the other. But, in\r\ntruth, there is no conservative feeling in the place!"\r\n\r\nPhineas, although he was at the present moment the member for\r\nLoughton himself, could not but enjoy the joke of this. Could there\r\nbe any liberal feeling in such a place, or, indeed, any political\r\nfeeling whatsoever? Would not Messrs. Grating and Shortribs have done\r\njust the same had it happened that Lord Brentford had been a Tory\r\npeer? "They all seemed to be very obliging," said Phineas, in answer\r\nto the Earl.\r\n\r\n"Yes, they are. There isn\'t a house in the town, you know, let\r\nfor longer than seven years, and most of them merely from year to\r\nyear. And, do you know, I haven\'t a farmer on the property with a\r\nlease,--not one; and they don\'t want leases. They know they\'re safe.\r\nBut I do like the people round me to be of the same way of thinking\r\nas myself about politics."\r\n\r\nOn the second day after dinner,--the last evening of Finn\'s visit to\r\nSaulsby,--the Earl fell suddenly into a confidential conversation\r\nabout his daughter and his son, and about Violet Effingham. So\r\nsudden, indeed, and so confidential was the conversation, that\r\nPhineas was almost silenced for awhile. A word or two had been said\r\nabout Loughlinter, of the beauty of the place and of the vastness of\r\nthe property. "I am almost afraid," said Lord Brentford, "that Laura\r\nis not happy there."\r\n\r\n"I hope she is," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"He is so hard and dry, and what I call exacting. That is just the\r\nword for it. Now Laura has never been used to that. With me she\r\nalways had her own way in everything, and I always found her fit\r\nto have it. I do not understand why her husband should treat her\r\ndifferently."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it is the temper of the man."\r\n\r\n"Temper, yes; but what a bad prospect is that for her! And she, too,\r\nhas a temper, and so he will find if he tries her too far. I cannot\r\nstand Loughlinter. I told Laura so fairly. It is one of those houses\r\nin which a man cannot call his hours his own. I told Laura that I\r\ncould not undertake to remain there for above a day or two."\r\n\r\n"It is very sad," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed; it is sad for her, poor girl; and very sad for me too.\r\nI have no one else but Laura,--literally no one; and now I am divided\r\nfrom her! It seems that she has been taken as much away from me as\r\nthough her husband lived in China. I have lost them both now!"\r\n\r\n"I hope not, my lord."\r\n\r\n"I say I have. As to Chiltern, I can perceive that he becomes more\r\nand more indifferent to me every day. He thinks of me only as a man\r\nin his way who must die some day and may die soon."\r\n\r\n"You wrong him, Lord Brentford."\r\n\r\n"I do not wrong him at all. Why has he answered every offer I have\r\nmade him with so much insolence as to make it impossible for me to\r\nput myself into further communion with him?"\r\n\r\n"He thinks that you have wronged him."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--because I have been unable to shut my eyes to his mode of\r\nliving. I was to go on paying his debts, and taking no other notice\r\nwhatsoever of his conduct!"\r\n\r\n"I do not think he is in debt now."\r\n\r\n"Because his sister the other day spent every shilling of her fortune\r\nin paying them. She gave him L40,000! Do you think she would have\r\nmarried Kennedy but for that? I don\'t. I could not prevent her. I had\r\nsaid that I would not cripple my remaining years of life by raising\r\nthe money, and I could not go back from my word."\r\n\r\n"You and Chiltern might raise the money between you."\r\n\r\n"It would do no good now. She has married Mr. Kennedy, and the money\r\nis nothing to her or to him. Chiltern might have put things right by\r\nmarrying Miss Effingham if he pleased."\r\n\r\n"I think he did his best there."\r\n\r\n"No;--he did his worst. He asked her to be his wife as a man asks for\r\na railway-ticket or a pair of gloves, which he buys with a price;\r\nand because she would not jump into his mouth he gave it up. I don\'t\r\nbelieve he even really wanted to marry her. I suppose he has some\r\ndisreputable connection to prevent it."\r\n\r\n"Nothing of the kind. He would marry her to-morrow if he could. My\r\nbelief is that Miss Effingham is sincere in refusing him."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t doubt her sincerity."\r\n\r\n"And that she will never change."\r\n\r\n"Ah, well; I don\'t agree with you, and I daresay I know them both\r\nbetter than you do. But everything goes against me. I had set my\r\nheart upon it, and therefore of course I shall be disappointed. What\r\nis he going to do this autumn?"\r\n\r\n"He is yachting now."\r\n\r\n"And who are with him?"\r\n\r\n"I think the boat belongs to Captain Colepepper."\r\n\r\n"The greatest blackguard in all England! A man who shoots pigeons and\r\nrides steeple-chases! And the worst of Chiltern is this, that even if\r\nhe didn\'t like the man, and if he were tired of this sort of life, he\r\nwould go on just the same because he thinks it a fine thing not to\r\ngive way." This was so true that Phineas did not dare to contradict\r\nthe statement, and therefore said nothing. "I had some faint hope,"\r\ncontinued the Earl, "while Laura could always watch him; because, in\r\nhis way, he was fond of his sister. But that is all over now. She\r\nwill have enough to do to watch herself!"\r\n\r\nPhineas had felt that the Earl had put him down rather sharply when\r\nhe had said that Violet would never accept Lord Chiltern, and he was\r\ntherefore not a little surprised when Lord Brentford spoke again of\r\nMiss Effingham the following morning, holding in his hand a letter\r\nwhich he had just received from her. "They are to be at Loughlinter\r\non the tenth," he said, "and she purposes to come here for a couple\r\nof nights on her way."\r\n\r\n"Lady Baldock and all?"\r\n\r\n"Well, yes; Lady Baldock and all. I am not very fond of Lady Baldock,\r\nbut I will put up with her for a couple of days for the sake of\r\nhaving Violet. She is more like a child of my own now than anybody\r\nelse. I shall not see her all the autumn afterwards. I cannot stand\r\nLoughlinter."\r\n\r\n"It will be better when the house is full."\r\n\r\n"You will be there, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Well, no; I think not," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"You have had enough of it, have you?" Phineas made no reply to this,\r\nbut smiled slightly. "By Jove, I don\'t wonder at it," said the Earl.\r\nPhineas, who would have given all he had in the world to be staying\r\nin the same country house with Violet Effingham, could not explain\r\nhow it had come to pass that he was obliged to absent himself. "I\r\nsuppose you were asked?" said the Earl.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I was asked. Nothing can be kinder than they are."\r\n\r\n"Kennedy told me that you were coming as a matter of course."\r\n\r\n"I explained to him after that," said Phineas, "that I should not\r\nreturn. I shall go over to Ireland. I have a deal of hard reading to\r\ndo, and I can get through it there without interruption."\r\n\r\nHe went up from Saulsby to London on that day, and found himself\r\nquite alone in Mrs. Bunce\'s lodgings. I mean not only that he was\r\nalone at his lodgings, but he was alone at his club, and alone in the\r\nstreets. July was not quite over, and yet all the birds of passage\r\nhad migrated. Mr. Mildmay, by his short session, had half ruined the\r\nLondon tradesmen, and had changed the summer mode of life of all\r\nthose who account themselves to be anybody. Phineas, as he sat alone\r\nin his room, felt himself to be nobody. He had told the Earl that\r\nhe was going to Ireland, and to Ireland he must go;--because he had\r\nnothing else to do. He had been asked indeed to join one or two\r\nparties in their autumn plans. Mr. Monk had wanted him to go to the\r\nPyrenees, and Lord Chiltern had suggested that he should join the\r\nyacht;--but neither plan suited him. It would have suited him to be\r\nat Loughlinter with Violet Effingham, but Loughlinter was a barred\r\nhouse to him. His old friend, Lady Laura, had told him not to come\r\nthither, explaining, with sufficient clearness, her reasons for\r\nexcluding him from the number of her husband\'s guests. As he thought\r\nof it the past scenes of his life became very marvellous to him.\r\nTwelve months since he would have given all the world for a word of\r\nlove from Lady Laura, and had barely dared to hope that such a word,\r\nat some future day, might possibly be spoken. Now such a word had in\r\ntruth been spoken, and it had come to be simply a trouble to him. She\r\nhad owned to him,--for, in truth, such had been the meaning of her\r\nwarning to him,--that, though she had married another man, she had\r\nloved and did love him. But in thinking of this he took no pride in\r\nit. It was not till he had thought of it long that he began to ask\r\nhimself whether he might not be justified in gathering from what\r\nhappened some hope that Violet also might learn to love him. He had\r\nthought so little of himself as to have been afraid at first to press\r\nhis suit with Lady Laura. Might he not venture to think more of\r\nhimself, having learned how far he had succeeded?\r\n\r\nBut how was he to get at Violet Effingham? From the moment at which\r\nhe had left Saulsby he had been angry with himself for not having\r\nasked Lord Brentford to allow him to remain there till after the\r\nBaldock party should have gone on to Loughlinter. The Earl, who was\r\nvery lonely in his house, would have consented at once. Phineas,\r\nindeed, was driven to confess to himself that success with Violet\r\nwould at once have put an end to all his friendship with Lord\r\nBrentford;--as also to all his friendship with Lord Chiltern. He\r\nwould, in such case, be bound in honour to vacate his seat and give\r\nback Loughton to his offended patron. But he would have given up much\r\nmore than his seat for Violet Effingham! At present, however, he had\r\nno means of getting at her to ask her the question. He could hardly\r\ngo to Loughlinter in opposition to the wishes of Lady Laura.\r\n\r\nA little adventure happened to him in London which somewhat relieved\r\nthe dulness of the days of the first week in August. He remained in\r\nLondon till the middle of August, half resolving to rush down to\r\nSaulsby when Violet Effingham should be there,--endeavouring to\r\nfind some excuse for such a proceeding, but racking his brains in\r\nvain,--and then there came about his little adventure. The adventure\r\nwas commenced by the receipt of the following letter:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Banner of the People Office,\r\n   3rd August, 186--.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR FINN,\r\n\r\n   I must say I think you have treated me badly, and without\r\n   that sort of brotherly fairness which we on the public\r\n   press expect from one another. However, perhaps we can\r\n   come to an understanding, and if so, things may yet go\r\n   smoothly. Give me a turn and I am not at all adverse to\r\n   give you one. Will you come to me here, or shall I call\r\n   upon you?\r\n\r\n   Yours always, Q. S.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhineas was not only surprised, but disgusted also, at the receipt\r\nof this letter. He could not imagine what was the deed by which he\r\nhad offended Mr. Slide. He thought over all the circumstances of\r\nhis short connection with the _People\'s Banner_, but could remember\r\nnothing which might have created offence. But his disgust was greater\r\nthan his surprise. He thought that he had done nothing and said\r\nnothing to justify Quintus Slide in calling him "dear Finn." He,\r\nwho had Lady Laura\'s secret in his keeping; he who hoped to be the\r\npossessor of Violet Effingham\'s affections,--he to be called "dear\r\nFinn" by such a one as Quintus Slide! He soon made up his mind that\r\nhe would not answer the note, but would go at once to the _People\'s\r\nBanner_ office at the hour at which Quintus Slide was always there.\r\nHe certainly would not write to "dear Slide;" and, until he had heard\r\nsomething more of this cause of offence, he would not make an enemy\r\nfor ever by calling the man "dear Sir." He went to the office of the\r\n_People\'s Banner_, and found Mr. Slide ensconced in a little glass\r\ncupboard, writing an article for the next day\'s copy.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you\'re very busy," said Phineas, inserting himself with\r\nsome difficulty on to a little stool in the corner of the cupboard.\r\n\r\n"Not so particular but what I\'m glad to see you. You shoot, don\'t\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"Shoot!" said Phineas. It could not be possible that Mr. Slide was\r\nintending, after this abrupt fashion, to propose a duel with pistols.\r\n\r\n"Grouse and pheasants, and them sort of things?" asked Mr. Slide.\r\n\r\n"Oh, ah; I understand. Yes, I shoot sometimes."\r\n\r\n"Is it the 12th or 20th for grouse in Scotland?"\r\n\r\n"The 12th," said Phineas. "What makes you ask that just now?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m doing a letter about it,--advising men not to shoot too many of\r\nthe young birds, and showing that they\'ll have none next year if they\r\ndo. I had a fellow here just now who knew all about it, and he put\r\ndown a lot; but I forgot to make him tell me the day of beginning.\r\nWhat\'s a good place to date from?"\r\n\r\nPhineas suggested Callender or Stirling.\r\n\r\n"Stirling\'s too much of a town, isn\'t it? Callender sounds better for\r\ngame, I think."\r\n\r\nSo the letter which was to save the young grouse was dated from\r\nCallender; and Mr. Quintus Slide having written the word, threw down\r\nhis pen, came off his stool, and rushed at once at his subject.\r\n\r\n"Well, now, Finn," he said, "don\'t you know that you\'ve treated me\r\nbadly about Loughton?"\r\n\r\n"Treated you badly about Loughton!" Phineas, as he repeated the\r\nwords, was quite in the dark as to Mr. Slide\'s meaning. Did Mr. Slide\r\nintend to convey a reproach because Phineas had not personally sent\r\nsome tidings of the election to the _People\'s Banner_?\r\n\r\n"Very badly," said Mr. Slide, with his arms akimbo,--"very badly\r\nindeed! Men on the press together do expect that they\'re to be\r\nstuck by, and not thrown over. Damn it, I say; what\'s the good of a\r\nbrotherhood if it ain\'t to be brotherhood?"\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, I don\'t know what you mean," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I tell you that I had Loughton in my heye?" said Quintus.\r\n\r\n"Oh--h!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s very well to say ho, and look guilty, but didn\'t I tell you?"\r\n\r\n"I never heard such nonsense in my life."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense?"\r\n\r\n"How on earth could you have stood for Loughton? What interest would\r\nyou have there? You could not even have found an elector to propose\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Now, I\'ll tell you what I\'ll do, Finn. I think you have thrown\r\nme over most shabby, but I won\'t stand about that. You shall have\r\nLoughton this session if you\'ll promise to make way for me after the\r\nnext election. If you\'ll agree to that, we\'ll have a special leader\r\nto say how well Lord What\'s-his-name has done with the borough; and\r\nwe\'ll be your horgan through the whole session."\r\n\r\n"I never heard such nonsense in my life. In the first place, Loughton\r\nis safe to be in the schedule of reduced boroughs. It will be thrown\r\ninto the county, or joined with a group."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll stand the chance of that. Will you agree?"\r\n\r\n"Agree! No! It\'s the most absurd proposal that was ever made. You\r\nmight as well ask me whether I would agree that you should go to\r\nheaven. Go to heaven if you can, I should say. I have not the\r\nslightest objection. But it\'s nothing to me."\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Quintus Slide. "Very well! Now we understand each\r\nother, and that\'s all that I desire. I think that I can show you what\r\nit is to come among gentlemen of the press, and then to throw them\r\nover. Good morning."\r\n\r\nPhineas, quite satisfied at the result of the interview as regarded\r\nhimself, and by no means sorry that there should have arisen a\r\ncause of separation between Mr. Quintus Slide and his "dear Finn,"\r\nshook off a little dust from his foot as he left the office of the\r\n_People\'s Banner_, and resolved that in future he would attempt to\r\nmake no connection in that direction. As he returned home he told\r\nhimself that a member of Parliament should be altogether independent\r\nof the press. On the second morning after his meeting with his late\r\nfriend, he saw the result of his independence. There was a startling\r\narticle, a tremendous article, showing the pressing necessity of\r\nimmediate reform, and proving the necessity by an illustration of\r\nthe borough-mongering rottenness of the present system. When such\r\na patron as Lord Brentford,--himself a Cabinet Minister with a\r\nsinecure,--could by his mere word put into the House such a stick as\r\nPhineas Finn,--a man who had struggled to stand on his legs before\r\nthe Speaker, but had wanted both the courage and the capacity,\r\nnothing further could surely be wanted to prove that the Reform Bill\r\nof 1832 required to be supplemented by some more energetic measure.\r\n\r\nPhineas laughed as he read the article, and declared to himself that\r\nthe joke was a good joke. But, nevertheless, he suffered. Mr. Quintus\r\nSlide, when he was really anxious to use his thong earnestly, could\r\ngenerally raise a wale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nWas He Honest?\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of August, Phineas Finn did return to Loughton. He went\r\ndown by the mail train on the night of the 10th, having telegraphed\r\nto the inn for a bed, and was up eating his breakfast in that\r\nhospitable house at nine o\'clock. The landlord and landlady with all\r\ntheir staff were at a loss to imagine what had brought down their\r\nmember again so quickly to his borough; but the reader, who will\r\nremember that Lady Baldock with her daughter and Violet Effingham\r\nwere to pass the 11th of the month at Saulsby, may perhaps be able\r\nto make a guess on the subject.\r\n\r\nPhineas had been thinking of making this sudden visit to Loughton\r\never since he had been up in town, but he could suggest to himself no\r\nreason to be given to Lord Brentford for his sudden reappearance. The\r\nEarl had been very kind to him, but he had said nothing which could\r\njustify his young friend in running in and out of Saulsby Castle at\r\npleasure, without invitation and without notice. Phineas was so well\r\naware of this himself that often as he had half resolved during the\r\nlast ten days to return to Saulsby, so often had he determined that\r\nhe could not do so. He could think of no excuse. Then the heavens\r\nfavoured him, and he received a letter from Lord Chiltern, in which\r\nthere was a message for Lord Brentford. "If you see my father, tell\r\nhim that I am ready at any moment to do what is necessary for raising\r\nthe money for Laura." Taking this as his excuse he returned to\r\nLoughton.\r\n\r\nAs chance arranged it, he met the Earl standing on the great steps\r\nbefore his own castle doors. "What, Finn; is this you? I thought you\r\nwere in Ireland."\r\n\r\n"Not yet, my lord, as you see." Then he opened his budget at once,\r\nand blushed at his own hypocrisy as he went on with his story. He\r\nhad, he said, felt the message from Chiltern to be so all-important\r\nthat he could not bring himself to go over to Ireland without\r\ndelivering it. He urged upon the Earl that he might learn from this\r\nhow anxious Lord Chiltern was to effect a reconciliation. When\r\nit occurred to him, he said, that there might be a hope of doing\r\nanything towards such an object, he could not go to Ireland leaving\r\nthe good work behind him. In love and war all things are fair. So he\r\ndeclared to himself; but as he did so he felt that his story was so\r\nweak that it would hardly gain for him an admittance into the Castle.\r\nIn this he was completely wrong. The Earl, swallowing the bait, put\r\nhis arm through that of the intruder, and, walking with him through\r\nthe paths of the shrubbery, at length confessed that he would be glad\r\nto be reconciled to his son if it were possible. "Let him come here,\r\nand she shall be here also," said the Earl, speaking of Violet. To\r\nthis Phineas could say nothing out loud, but he told himself that all\r\nshould be fair between them. He would take no dishonest advantage of\r\nLord Chiltern. He would give Lord Chiltern the whole message as it\r\nwas given to him by Lord Brentford. But should it so turn out that he\r\nhimself got an opportunity of saying to Violet all that he had come\r\nto say, and should it also turn out,--an event which he acknowledged\r\nto himself to be most unlikely,--that Violet did not reject him, then\r\nhow could he write his letter to Lord Chiltern? So he resolved that\r\nthe letter should be written before he saw Violet. But how could he\r\nwrite such a letter and instantly afterwards do that which would\r\nbe false to the spirit of a letter so written? Could he bid Lord\r\nChiltern come home to woo Violet Effingham, and instantly go forth\r\nto woo her for himself? He found that he could not do so,--unless he\r\ntold the whole truth to Lord Chiltern. In no other way could he carry\r\nout his project and satisfy his own idea of what was honest.\r\n\r\nThe Earl bade him send to the hotel for his things. "The Baldock\r\npeople are all here, you know, but they go very early to-morrow."\r\nThen Phineas declared that he also must return to London very early\r\non the morrow;--but in the meantime he would go to the inn and fetch\r\nhis things. The Earl thanked him again and again for his generous\r\nkindness; and Phineas, blushing as he received the thanks, went back\r\nand wrote his letter to Lord Chiltern. It was an elaborate letter,\r\nwritten, as regards the first and larger portion of it, with words\r\nintended to bring the prodigal son back to the father\'s home. And\r\neverything was said about Miss Effingham that could or should have\r\nbeen said. Then, on the last page, he told his own story. "Now," he\r\nsaid, "I must speak of myself:"--and he went on to explain to his\r\nfriend, in the plainest language that he could use, his own position.\r\n"I have loved her," he said, "for six months, and I am here with\r\nthe express intention of asking her to take me. The chances are ten\r\nto one that she refuses me. I do not deprecate your anger,--if you\r\nchoose to be angry. But I am endeavouring to treat you well, and I\r\nask you to do the same by me. I must convey to you your father\'s\r\nmessage, and after doing so I cannot address myself to Miss Effingham\r\nwithout telling you. I should feel myself to be false were I to do\r\nso. In the event,--the probable, nay, almost certain event of my\r\nbeing refused,--I shall trust you to keep my secret. Do not quarrel\r\nwith me if you can help it;--but if you must I will be ready." Then\r\nhe posted the letter and went up to the Castle.\r\n\r\nHe had only the one day for his action, and he knew that Violet was\r\nwatched by Lady Baldock as by a dragon. He was told that the Earl\r\nwas out with the young ladies, and was shown to his room. On going\r\nto the drawing-room he found Lady Baldock, with whom he had been,\r\nto a certain degree, a favourite, and was soon deeply engaged in\r\na conversation as to the practicability of shutting up all the\r\nbreweries and distilleries by Act of Parliament. But lunch relieved\r\nhim, and brought the young ladies in at two. Miss Effingham seemed\r\nto be really glad to see him, and even Miss Boreham, Lady Baldock\'s\r\ndaughter, was very gracious to him. For the Earl had been speaking\r\nwell of his young member, and Phineas had in a way grown into the\r\ngood graces of sober and discreet people. After lunch they were to\r\nride;--the Earl, that is, and Violet. Lady Baldock and her daughter\r\nwere to have the carriage. "I can mount you, Finn, if you would like\r\nit," said the Earl. "Of course he\'ll like it," said Violet; "do you\r\nsuppose Mr. Finn will object to ride with me in Saulsby Woods? It\r\nwon\'t be the first time, will it?" "Violet," said Lady Baldock, "you\r\nhave the most singular way of talking." "I suppose I have," said\r\nViolet; "but I don\'t think I can change it now. Mr. Finn knows me too\r\nwell to mind it much."\r\n\r\nIt was past five before they were on horseback, and up to that time\r\nPhineas had not found himself alone with Violet Effingham for a\r\nmoment. They had sat together after lunch in the dining-room for\r\nnearly an hour, and had sauntered into the hall and knocked about\r\nthe billiard balls, and then stood together at the open doors of a\r\nconservatory. But Lady Baldock or Miss Boreham had always been there.\r\nNothing could be more pleasant than Miss Effingham\'s words, or more\r\nfamiliar than her manner to Phineas. She had expressed strong delight\r\nat his success in getting a seat in Parliament, and had talked to him\r\nabout the Kennedys as though they had created some special bond of\r\nunion between her and Phineas which ought to make them intimate. But,\r\nfor all that, she could not be got to separate herself from Lady\r\nBaldock;--and when she was told that if she meant to ride she must go\r\nand dress herself, she went at once.\r\n\r\nBut he thought that he might have a chance on horseback; and after\r\nthey had been out about half an hour, chance did favour him. For\r\nawhile he rode behind with the carriage, calculating that by his so\r\ndoing the Earl would be put off his guard, and would be disposed\r\nafter awhile to change places with him. And so it fell out. At a\r\ncertain fall of ground in the park, where the road turned round and\r\ncrossed a bridge over the little river, the carriage came up with the\r\nfirst two horses, and Lady Baldock spoke a word to the Earl. Then\r\nViolet pulled up, allowing the vehicle to pass the bridge first, and\r\nin this way she and Phineas were brought together,--and in this way\r\nthey rode on. But he was aware that he must greatly increase the\r\ndistance between them and the others of their party before he could\r\ndare to plead his suit, and even were that done he felt that he would\r\nnot know how to plead it on horseback.\r\n\r\nThey had gone on some half mile in this way when they reached a spot\r\non which a green ride led away from the main road through the trees\r\nto the left. "You remember this place, do you not?" said Violet.\r\nPhineas declared that he remembered it well. "I must go round by the\r\nwoodman\'s cottage. You won\'t mind coming?" Phineas said that he would\r\nnot mind, and trotted on to tell them in the carriage.\r\n\r\n"Where is she going?" asked Lady Baldock; and then, when Phineas\r\nexplained, she begged the Earl to go back to Violet. The Earl,\r\nfeeling the absurdity of this, declared that Violet knew her way very\r\nwell herself, and thus Phineas got his opportunity.\r\n\r\nThey rode on almost without speaking for nearly a mile, cantering\r\nthrough the trees, and then they took another turn to the right, and\r\ncame upon the cottage. They rode to the door, and spoke a word or two\r\nto the woman there, and then passed on. "I always come here when I am\r\nat Saulsby," said Violet, "that I may teach myself to think kindly of\r\nLord Chiltern."\r\n\r\n"I understand it all," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"He used to be so nice;--and is so still, I believe, only that he has\r\ntaught himself to be so rough. Will he ever change, do you think?"\r\n\r\nPhineas knew that in this emergency it was his especial duty to be\r\nhonest. "I think he would be changed altogether if we could bring him\r\nhere,--so that he should live among his friends."\r\n\r\n"Do you think he would? We must put our heads together, and do it.\r\nDon\'t you think that it is to be done?"\r\n\r\nPhineas replied that he thought it was to be done. "I\'ll tell you the\r\ntruth at once, Miss Effingham," he said. "You can do it by a single\r\nword."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--yes;" she said; "but I do not mean that;--without that. It\r\nis absurd, you know, that a father should make such a condition as\r\nthat." Phineas said that he thought it was absurd; and then they rode\r\non again, cantering through the wood. He had been bold to speak to\r\nher about Lord Chiltern as he had done, and she had answered just as\r\nhe would have wished to be answered. But how could he press his suit\r\nfor himself while she was cantering by his side?\r\n\r\nPresently they came to rough ground over which they were forced to\r\nwalk, and he was close by her side. "Mr. Finn," she said, "I wonder\r\nwhether I may ask a question?"\r\n\r\n"Any question," he replied.\r\n\r\n"Is there any quarrel between you and Lady Laura?"\r\n\r\n"None."\r\n\r\n"Or between you and him?"\r\n\r\n"No;--none. We are greater allies than ever."\r\n\r\n"Then why are you not going to be at Loughlinter? She has written to\r\nme expressly saying you would not be there."\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment before he replied. "It did not suit," he said at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n"It is a secret then?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--it is a secret. You are not angry with me?"\r\n\r\n"Angry; no."\r\n\r\n"It is not a secret of my own, or I should not keep it from you."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I can guess it," she said. "But I will not try. I will not\r\neven think of it."\r\n\r\n"The cause, whatever it be, has been full of sorrow to me. I would\r\nhave given my left hand to have been at Loughlinter this autumn."\r\n\r\n"Are you so fond of it?"\r\n\r\n"I should have been staying there with you," he said. He paused, and\r\nfor a moment there was no word spoken by either of them; but he could\r\nperceive that the hand in which she held her whip was playing with\r\nher horse\'s mane with a nervous movement. "When I found how it must\r\nbe, and that I must miss you, I rushed down here that I might see\r\nyou for a moment. And now I am here I do not dare to speak to you of\r\nmyself." They were now beyond the rocks, and Violet, without speaking\r\na word, again put her horse into a trot. He was by her side in a\r\nmoment, but he could not see her face. "Have you not a word to say to\r\nme?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"No;--no;--no;" she replied, "not a word when you speak to me like\r\nthat. There is the carriage. Come;--we will join them." Then she\r\ncantered on, and he followed her till they reached the Earl and Lady\r\nBaldock and Miss Boreham. "I have done my devotions now," said Miss\r\nEffingham, "and am ready to return to ordinary life."\r\n\r\nPhineas could not find another moment in which to speak to her.\r\nThough he spent the evening with her, and stood over her as she sang\r\nat the Earl\'s request, and pressed her hand as she went to bed, and\r\nwas up to see her start in the morning, he could not draw from her\r\neither a word or a look.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nMr. Monk upon Reform\r\n\r\n\r\nPhineas Finn went to Ireland immediately after his return from\r\nSaulsby, having said nothing further to Violet Effingham, and having\r\nheard nothing further from her than what is recorded in the last\r\nchapter. He felt very keenly that his position was unsatisfactory,\r\nand brooded over it all the autumn and early winter; but he could\r\nform no plan for improving it. A dozen times he thought of writing\r\nto Miss Effingham, and asking for an explicit answer. He could not,\r\nhowever, bring himself to write the letter, thinking that written\r\nexpressions of love are always weak and vapid,--and deterred also\r\nby a conviction that Violet, if driven to reply in writing, would\r\nundoubtedly reply by a refusal. Fifty times he rode again in his\r\nimagination his ride in Saulsby Wood, and he told himself as often\r\nthat the syren\'s answer to him,--her no, no, no,--had been, of all\r\npossible answers, the most indefinite and provoking. The tone of her\r\nvoice as she galloped away from him, the bearing of her countenance\r\nwhen he rejoined her, her manner to him when he saw her start from\r\nthe Castle in the morning, all forbade him to believe that his words\r\nto her had been taken as an offence. She had replied to him with a\r\ndirect negative, simply with the word "no;" but she had so said it\r\nthat there had hardly been any sting in the no; and he had known at\r\nthe moment that whatever might be the result of his suit, he need not\r\nregard Violet Effingham as his enemy.\r\n\r\nBut the doubt made his sojourn in Ireland very wearisome to him.\r\nAnd there were other matters which tended also to his discomfort,\r\nthough he was not left even at this period of his life without a\r\ncontinuation of success which seemed to be very wonderful. And,\r\nfirst, I will say a word of his discomfort. He heard not a line from\r\nLord Chiltern in answer to the letter which he had written to his\r\nlordship. From Lady Laura he did hear frequently. Lady Laura wrote to\r\nhim exactly as though she had never warned him away from Loughlinter,\r\nand as though there had been no occasion for such warning. She sent\r\nhim letters filled chiefly with politics, saying something also of\r\nthe guests at Loughlinter, something of the game, and just a word\r\nor two here and there of her husband. The letters were very good\r\nletters, and he preserved them carefully. It was manifest to him that\r\nthey were intended to be good letters, and, as such, to be preserved.\r\nIn one of these, which he received about the end of November,\r\nshe told him that her brother was again in his old haunt, at the\r\nWillingford Bull, and that he had sent to Portman Square for all\r\nproperty of his own that had been left there. But there was no word\r\nin that letter of Violet Effingham; and though Lady Laura did speak\r\nmore than once of Violet, she always did so as though Violet were\r\nsimply a joint acquaintance of herself and her correspondent. There\r\nwas no allusion to the existence of any special regard on his part\r\nfor Miss Effingham. He had thought that Violet might probably tell\r\nher friend what had occurred at Saulsby;--but if she did so, Lady\r\nLaura was happy in her powers of reticence. Our hero was disturbed\r\nalso when he reached home by finding that Mrs. Flood Jones and Miss\r\nFlood Jones had retired from Killaloe for the winter. I do not know\r\nwhether he might not have been more disturbed by the presence of the\r\nyoung lady, for he would have found himself constrained to exhibit\r\ntowards her some tenderness of manner; and any such tenderness of\r\nmanner would, in his existing circumstances, have been dangerous. But\r\nhe was made to understand that Mary Flood Jones had been taken away\r\nfrom Killaloe because it was thought that he had ill-treated the\r\nlady, and the accusation made him unhappy. In the middle of the heat\r\nof the last session he had received a letter from his sister, in\r\nwhich some pushing question had been asked as to his then existing\r\nfeeling about poor Mary. This he had answered petulantly. Nothing\r\nmore had been written to him about Miss Jones, and nothing was said\r\nto him when he reached home. He could not, however, but ask after\r\nMary, and when he did ask, the accusation was made again in that\r\nquietly severe manner with which, perhaps, most of us have been made\r\nacquainted at some period of our lives. "I think, Phineas," said his\r\nsister, "we had better say nothing about dear Mary. She is not here\r\nat present, and probably you may not see her while you remain with\r\nus." "What\'s all that about?" Phineas had demanded,--understanding\r\nthe whole matter thoroughly. Then his sister had demurely refused to\r\nsay a word further on the subject, and not a word further was said\r\nabout Miss Mary Flood Jones. They were at Floodborough, living, he\r\ndid not doubt, in a very desolate way,--and quite willing, he did not\r\ndoubt also, to abandon their desolation if he would go over there in\r\nthe manner that would become him after what had passed on one or two\r\noccasions between him and the young lady. But how was he to do this\r\nwith such work on his hands as he had undertaken? Now that he was in\r\nIreland, he thought that he did love dear Mary very dearly. He felt\r\nthat he had two identities,--that he was, as it were, two separate\r\npersons,--and that he could, without any real faithlessness, be very\r\nmuch in love with Violet Effingham in his position of man of fashion\r\nand member of Parliament in England, and also warmly attached to dear\r\nlittle Mary Flood Jones as an Irishman of Killaloe. He was aware,\r\nhowever, that there was a prejudice against such fulness of heart,\r\nand, therefore, resolved sternly that it was his duty to be constant\r\nto Miss Effingham. How was it possible that he should marry dear\r\nMary,--he, with such extensive jobs of work on his hands! It was not\r\npossible. He must abandon all thought of making dear Mary his own. No\r\ndoubt they had been right to remove her. But, still, as he took his\r\nsolitary walks along the Shannon, and up on the hills that overhung\r\nthe lake above the town, he felt somewhat ashamed of himself, and\r\ndreamed of giving up Parliament, of leaving Violet to some noble\r\nsuitor,--to Lord Chiltern, if she would take him,--and of going to\r\nFloodborough with an honest proposal that he should be allowed to\r\npress Mary to his heart. Miss Effingham would probably reject him\r\nat last; whereas Mary, dear Mary, would come to his heart without\r\na scruple of doubt. Dear Mary! In these days of dreaming, he told\r\nhimself that, after all, dear Mary was his real love. But, of course,\r\nsuch days were days of dreaming only. He had letters in his pocket\r\nfrom Lady Laura Kennedy which made it impossible for him to think in\r\nearnest of giving up Parliament.\r\n\r\nAnd then there came a wonderful piece of luck in his way. There\r\nlived, or had lived, in the town of Galway a very eccentric old lady,\r\none Miss Marian Persse, who was the aunt of Mrs. Finn, the mother\r\nof our hero. With this lady Dr. Finn had quarrelled persistently\r\never since his marriage, because the lady had expressed her wish to\r\ninterfere in the management of his family,--offering to purchase such\r\nright by favourable arrangements in reference to her will. This the\r\ndoctor had resented, and there had been quarrels. Miss Persse was not\r\na very rich old lady, but she thought a good deal of her own money.\r\nAnd now she died, leaving L3,000 to her nephew Phineas Finn. Another\r\nsum of about equal amount she bequeathed to a Roman Catholic\r\nseminary; and thus was her worldly wealth divided. "She couldn\'t\r\nhave done better with it," said the old doctor; "and as far as we\r\nare concerned, the windfall is the more pleasant as being wholly\r\nunexpected." In these days the doctor was undoubtedly gratified by\r\nhis son\'s success in life, and never said much about the law. Phineas\r\nin truth did do some work during the autumn, reading blue-books,\r\nreading law books, reading perhaps a novel or two at the same\r\ntime,--but shutting himself up very carefully as he studied, so that\r\nhis sisters were made to understand that for a certain four hours in\r\nthe day not a sound was to be allowed to disturb him.\r\n\r\nOn the receipt of his legacy he at once offered to repay his father\r\nall money that had been advanced him over and above his original\r\nallowance; but this the doctor refused to take. "It comes to the same\r\nthing, Phineas," he said. "What you have of your share now you can\'t\r\nhave hereafter. As regards my present income, it has only made me\r\nwork a little longer than I had intended; and I believe that the\r\nlater in life a man works, the more likely he is to live." Phineas,\r\ntherefore, when he returned to London, had his \xc2\xa33,000 in his pocket.\r\nHe owed some L500; and the remainder he would, of course, invest.\r\n\r\nThere had been some talk of an autumnal session, but Mr. Mildmay\'s\r\ndecision had at last been against it. Who cannot understand that such\r\nwould be the decision of any Minister to whom was left the slightest\r\nfraction of free will in the matter? Why should any Minister court\r\nthe danger of unnecessary attack, submit himself to unnecessary work,\r\nand incur the odium of summoning all his friends from their rest?\r\nIn the midst of the doubts as to the new and old Ministry, when\r\nthe political needle was vacillating so tremulously on its pivot,\r\npointing now to one set of men as the coming Government and then to\r\nanother, vague suggestions as to an autumn session might be useful.\r\nAnd they were thrown out in all good faith. Mr. Mildmay, when he\r\nspoke on the subject to the Duke, was earnest in thinking that the\r\nquestion of Reform should not be postponed even for six months.\r\n"Don\'t pledge yourself," said the Duke;--and Mr. Mildmay did not\r\npledge himself. Afterwards, when Mr. Mildmay found that he was\r\nonce more assuredly Prime Minister, he changed his mind, and felt\r\nhimself to be under a fresh obligation to the Duke. Lord de Terrier\r\nhad altogether failed, and the country might very well wait till\r\nFebruary. The country did wait till February, somewhat to the\r\ndisappointment of Phineas Finn, who had become tired of blue-books\r\nat Killaloe. The difference between his English life and his life at\r\nhome was so great, that it was hardly possible that he should not\r\nbecome weary of the latter. He did become weary of it, but strove\r\ngallantly to hide his weariness from his father and mother.\r\n\r\nAt this time the world was talking much about Reform, though Mr.\r\nMildmay had become placidly patient. The feeling was growing, and\r\nMr. Turnbull, with his friends, was doing all he could to make it\r\ngrow fast. There was a certain amount of excitement on the subject;\r\nbut the excitement had grown downwards, from the leaders to the\r\npeople,--from the self-instituted leaders of popular politics down,\r\nby means of the press, to the ranks of working men, instead of\r\ngrowing upwards, from the dissatisfaction of the masses, till it\r\nexpressed itself by this mouthpiece and that, chosen by the people\r\nthemselves. There was no strong throb through the country, making\r\nmen feel that safety was to be had by Reform, and could not be had\r\nwithout Reform. But there was an understanding that the press and the\r\norators were too strong to be ignored, and that some new measure of\r\nReform must be conceded to them. The sooner the concession was made,\r\nthe less it might be necessary to concede. And all men of all parties\r\nwere agreed on this point. That Reform was in itself odious to many\r\nof those who spoke of it freely, who offered themselves willingly to\r\nbe its promoters, was acknowledged. It was not only odious to Lord de\r\nTerrier and to most of those who worked with him, but was equally so\r\nto many of Mr. Mildmay\'s most constant supporters. The Duke had no\r\nwish for Reform. Indeed it is hard to suppose that such a Duke can\r\nwish for any change in a state of things that must seem to him to be\r\nso salutary. Workmen were getting full wages. Farmers were paying\r\ntheir rent. Capitalists by the dozen were creating capitalists by the\r\nhundreds. Nothing was wrong in the country, but the over-dominant\r\nspirit of speculative commerce;--and there was nothing in Reform to\r\ncheck that. Why should the Duke want Reform? As for such men as Lord\r\nBrentford, Sir Harry Coldfoot, Lord Plinlimmon, and Mr. Legge Wilson,\r\nit was known to all men that they advocated Reform as we all of us\r\nadvocate doctors. Some amount of doctoring is necessary for us. We\r\nmay hardly hope to avoid it. But let us have as little of the doctor\r\nas possible. Mr. Turnbull, and the cheap press, and the rising spirit\r\nof the loudest among the people, made it manifest that something must\r\nbe conceded. Let us be generous in our concession. That was now the\r\ndoctrine of many,--perhaps of most of the leading politicians of the\r\nday. Let us be generous. Let us at any rate seem to be generous. Let\r\nus give with an open hand,--but still with a hand which, though open,\r\nshall not bestow too much. The coach must be allowed to run down the\r\nhill. Indeed, unless the coach goes on running no journey will be\r\nmade. But let us have the drag on both the hind wheels. And we must\r\nremember that coaches running down hill without drags are apt to come\r\nto serious misfortune.\r\n\r\nBut there were men, even in the Cabinet, who had other ideas of\r\npublic service than that of dragging the wheels of the coach. Mr.\r\nGresham was in earnest. Plantagenet Palliser was in earnest. That\r\nexceedingly intelligent young nobleman Lord Cantrip was in earnest.\r\nMr. Mildmay threw, perhaps, as much of earnestness into the matter\r\nas was compatible with his age and his full appreciation of the\r\nmanner in which the present cry for Reform had been aroused. He was\r\nthoroughly honest, thoroughly patriotic, and thoroughly ambitious\r\nthat he should be written of hereafter as one who to the end of a\r\nlong life had worked sedulously for the welfare of the people;--but\r\nhe disbelieved in Mr. Turnbull, and in the bottom of his heart\r\nindulged an aristocratic contempt for the penny press. And there was\r\nno man in England more in earnest, more truly desirous of Reform,\r\nthan Mr. Monk. It was his great political idea that political\r\nadvantages should be extended to the people, whether the people\r\nclamoured for them or did not clamour for them,--even whether they\r\ndesired them or did not desire them. "You do not ask a child whether\r\nhe would like to learn his lesson," he would say. "At any rate, you\r\ndo not wait till he cries for his book." When, therefore, men said to\r\nhim that there was no earnestness in the cry for Reform, that the cry\r\nwas a false cry, got up for factious purposes by interested persons,\r\nhe would reply that the thing to be done should not be done in\r\nobedience to any cry, but because it was demanded by justice, and was\r\na debt due to the people.\r\n\r\nOur hero in the autumn had written to Mr. Monk on the politics of the\r\nmoment, and the following had been Mr. Monk\'s reply:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Longroyston, October 12, 186--.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR FINN,\r\n\r\n   I am staying here with the Duke and Duchess of St.\r\n   Bungay. The house is very full, and Mr. Mildmay was\r\n   here last week; but as I don\'t shoot, and can\'t play\r\n   billiards, and have no taste for charades, I am becoming\r\n   tired of the gaieties, and shall leave them to-morrow.\r\n   Of course you know that we are not to have the autumn\r\n   session. I think that Mr. Mildmay is right. Could we have\r\n   been sure of passing our measure, it would have been very\r\n   well; but we could not have been sure, and failure with\r\n   our bill in a session convened for the express purpose of\r\n   passing it would have injured the cause greatly. We could\r\n   hardly have gone on with it again in the spring. Indeed,\r\n   we must have resigned. And though I may truly say that I\r\n   would as lief have a good measure from Lord de Terrier\r\n   as from Mr. Mildmay, and that I am indifferent to my own\r\n   present personal position, still I think that we should\r\n   endeavour to keep our seats as long as we honestly\r\n   believe ourselves to be more capable of passing a good\r\n   measure than are our opponents.\r\n\r\n   I am astonished by the difference of opinion which\r\n   exists about Reform,--not only as to the difference in\r\n   the extent and exact tendency of the measure that is\r\n   needed,--but that there should be such a divergence of\r\n   ideas as to the grand thing to be done and the grand\r\n   reason for doing it. We are all agreed that we want\r\n   Reform in order that the House of Commons may be returned\r\n   by a larger proportion of the people than is at present\r\n   employed upon that work, and that each member when\r\n   returned should represent a somewhat more equal section\r\n   of the whole constituencies of the country than our\r\n   members generally do at present. All men confess that a\r\n   L50 county franchise must be too high, and that a borough\r\n   with less than two hundred registered voters must be\r\n   wrong. But it seems to me that but few among us perceive,\r\n   or at any rate acknowledge, the real reasons for changing\r\n   these things and reforming what is wrong without delay.\r\n   One great authority told us the other day that the sole\r\n   object of legislation on this subject should be to get\r\n   together the best possible 658 members of Parliament.\r\n   That to me would be a most repulsive idea if it were\r\n   not that by its very vagueness it becomes inoperative.\r\n   Who shall say what is best; or what characteristic\r\n   constitutes excellence in a member of Parliament? If\r\n   the gentleman means excellence in general wisdom, or\r\n   in statecraft, or in skill in talking, or in private\r\n   character, or even excellence in patriotism, then I say\r\n   that he is utterly wrong, and has never touched with\r\n   his intellect the true theory of representation. One\r\n   only excellence may be acknowledged, and that is the\r\n   excellence of likeness. As a portrait should be like the\r\n   person portrayed, so should a representative House be\r\n   like the people whom it represents. Nor in arranging\r\n   a franchise does it seem to me that we have a right\r\n   to regard any other view. If a country be unfit for\r\n   representative government,--and it may be that there are\r\n   still peoples unable to use properly that greatest of\r\n   all blessings,--the question as to what state policy may\r\n   be best for them is a different question. But if we do\r\n   have representation, let the representative assembly be\r\n   like the people, whatever else may be its virtues,--and\r\n   whatever else its vices.\r\n\r\n   Another great authority has told us that our House of\r\n   Commons should be the mirror of the people. I say, not\r\n   its mirror, but its miniature. And let the artist be\r\n   careful to put in every line of the expression of that\r\n   ever-moving face. To do this is a great work, and the\r\n   artist must know his trade well. In America the work has\r\n   been done with so coarse a hand that nothing is shown\r\n   in the picture but the broad, plain, unspeaking outline\r\n   of the face. As you look from the represented to the\r\n   representation you cannot but acknowledge the likeness;\r\n   --but there is in that portrait more of the body than of\r\n   the mind. The true portrait should represent more than\r\n   the body. With us, hitherto, there have been snatches\r\n   of the countenance of the nation which have been\r\n   inimitable,--a turn of the eye here and a curl of the lip\r\n   there, which have seemed to denote a power almost divine.\r\n   There have been marvels on the canvas so beautiful that\r\n   one approaches the work of remodelling it with awe.\r\n   But not only is the picture imperfect,--a thing of\r\n   snatches,--but with years it becomes less and still less\r\n   like its original.\r\n\r\n   The necessity for remodelling it is imperative, and we\r\n   shall be cowards if we decline the work. But let us be\r\n   specially careful to retain as much as possible of those\r\n   lines which we all acknowledge to be so faithfully\r\n   representative of our nation. To give to a bare numerical\r\n   majority of the people that power which the numerical\r\n   majority has in the United States, would not be to\r\n   achieve representation. The nation as it now exists would\r\n   not be known by such a portrait;--but neither can it\r\n   now be known by that which exists. It seems to me that\r\n   they who are adverse to change, looking back with an\r\n   unmeasured respect on what our old Parliaments have done\r\n   for us, ignore the majestic growth of the English people,\r\n   and forget the present in their worship of the past. They\r\n   think that we must be what we were,--at any rate, what\r\n   we were thirty years since. They have not, perhaps, gone\r\n   into the houses of artisans, or, if there, they have not\r\n   looked into the breasts of the men. With population vice\r\n   has increased, and these politicians, with ears but\r\n   no eyes, hear of drunkenness and sin and ignorance.\r\n   And then they declare to themselves that this wicked,\r\n   half-barbarous, idle people should be controlled and not\r\n   represented. A wicked, half-barbarous, idle people may be\r\n   controlled;--but not a people thoughtful, educated, and\r\n   industrious. We must look to it that we do not endeavour\r\n   to carry our control beyond the wickedness and the\r\n   barbarity, and that we be ready to submit to control from\r\n   thoughtfulness and industry.\r\n\r\n   I hope we shall find you helping at the good work early\r\n   in the spring.\r\n\r\n   Yours, always faithfully,\r\n\r\n   JOSHUA MONK.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhineas was up in London before the end of January, but did not find\r\nthere many of those whom he wished to see. Mr. Low was there, and to\r\nhim he showed Mr. Monk\'s letter, thinking that it must be convincing\r\neven to Mr. Low. This he did in Mrs. Low\'s drawing-room, knowing that\r\nMrs. Low would also condescend to discuss politics on an occasion.\r\nHe had dined with them, and they had been glad to see him, and Mrs.\r\nLow had been less severe than hitherto against the great sin of her\r\nhusband\'s late pupil. She had condescended to congratulate him on\r\nbecoming member for an English borough instead of an Irish one, and\r\nhad asked him questions about Saulsby Castle. But, nevertheless, Mr.\r\nMonk\'s letter was not received with that respectful admiration which\r\nPhineas thought that it deserved. Phineas, foolishly, had read it\r\nout loud, so that the attack came upon him simultaneously from the\r\nhusband and from the wife.\r\n\r\n"It is just the usual claptrap," said Mr. Low, "only put into\r\nlanguage somewhat more grandiloquent than usual."\r\n\r\n"Claptrap!" said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"It\'s what I call downright Radical nonsense," said Mrs. Low, nodding\r\nher head energetically. "Portrait indeed! Why should we want to have\r\na portrait of ignorance and ugliness? What we all want is to have\r\nthings quiet and orderly."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'d better have a paternal government at once," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Just so," said Mr. Low,--"only that what you call a paternal\r\ngovernment is not always quiet and orderly. National order I take to\r\nbe submission to the law. I should not think it quiet and orderly if\r\nI were sent to Cayenne without being brought before a jury."\r\n\r\n"But such a man as you would not be sent to Cayenne," said Phineas,\r\n\r\n"My next-door neighbour might be,--which would be almost as bad. Let\r\nhim be sent to Cayenne if he deserves it, but let a jury say that\r\nhe has deserved it. My idea of government is this,--that we want\r\nto be governed by law and not by caprice, and that we must have a\r\nlegislature to make our laws. If I thought that Parliament as at\r\npresent established made the laws badly, I would desire a change;\r\nbut I doubt whether we shall have them better from any change in\r\nParliament which Reform will give us."\r\n\r\n"Of course not," said Mrs. Low. "But we shall have a lot of beggars\r\nput on horseback, and we all know where they ride to."\r\n\r\nThen Phineas became aware that it is not easy to convince any man or\r\nany woman on a point of politics,--not even though he who argues may\r\nhave an eloquent letter from a philosophical Cabinet Minister in his\r\npocket to assist him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nPhineas Finn Makes Progress\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary was far advanced and the new Reform Bill had already been\r\nbrought forward, before Lady Laura Kennedy came up to town. Phineas\r\nhad of course seen Mr. Kennedy and had heard from him tidings of\r\nhis wife. She was at Saulsby with Lady Baldock and Miss Boreham and\r\nViolet Effingham, but was to be in London soon. Mr. Kennedy, as it\r\nappeared, did not quite know when he was to expect his wife; and\r\nPhineas thought that he could perceive from the tone of the husband\'s\r\nvoice that something was amiss. He could not however ask any\r\nquestions excepting such as referred to the expected arrival. Was\r\nMiss Effingham to come to London with Lady Laura? Mr. Kennedy\r\nbelieved that Miss Effingham would be up before Easter, but he did\r\nnot know whether she would come with his wife. "Women," he said, "are\r\nso fond of mystery that one can never quite know what they intend to\r\ndo." He corrected himself at once however, perceiving that he had\r\nseemed to say something against his wife, and explained that his\r\ngeneral accusation against the sex was not intended to apply to\r\nLady Laura. This, however, he did so awkwardly as to strengthen\r\nthe feeling with Phineas that something assuredly was wrong. "Miss\r\nEffingham," said Mr. Kennedy, "never seems to know her own mind."\r\n"I suppose she is like other beautiful girls who are petted on all\r\nsides," said Phineas. "As for her beauty, I don\'t think much of it,"\r\nsaid Mr. Kennedy; "and as for petting, I do not understand it in\r\nreference to grown persons. Children may be petted, and dogs,--though\r\nthat too is bad; but what you call petting for grown persons is I\r\nthink frivolous and almost indecent." Phineas could not help thinking\r\nof Lord Chiltern\'s opinion that it would have been wise to have left\r\nMr. Kennedy in the hands of the garrotters.\r\n\r\nThe debate on the second reading of the bill was to be commenced\r\non the 1st of March, and two days before that Lady Laura arrived\r\nin Grosvenor Place. Phineas got a note from her in three words to\r\nsay that she was at home and would see him if he called on Sunday\r\nafternoon. The Sunday to which she alluded was the last day of\r\nFebruary. Phineas was now more certain than ever that something\r\nwas wrong. Had there been nothing wrong between Lady Laura and her\r\nhusband, she would not have rebelled against him by asking visitors\r\nto the house on a Sunday. He had nothing to do with that, however,\r\nand of course he did as he was desired. He called on the Sunday, and\r\nfound Mrs. Bonteen sitting with Lady Laura. "I am just in time for\r\nthe debate," said Lady Laura, when the first greeting was over.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say that you intend to sit it out," said Mrs.\r\nBonteen.\r\n\r\n"Every word of it,--unless I lose my seat. What else is there to be\r\ndone at present?"\r\n\r\n"But the place they give us is so unpleasant," said Mrs. Bonteen.\r\n\r\n"There are worse places even than the Ladies\' Gallery," said\r\nLady Laura. "And perhaps it is as well to make oneself used to\r\ninconveniences of all kinds. You will speak, Mr. Finn?"\r\n\r\n"I intend to do so."\r\n\r\n"Of course you will. The great speeches will be Mr. Gresham\'s, Mr.\r\nDaubeny\'s, and Mr. Monk\'s."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Palliser intends to be very strong," said Mrs. Bonteen.\r\n\r\n"A man cannot be strong or not as he likes it," said Lady Laura. "Mr.\r\nPalliser I believe to be a most useful man, but he never can become\r\nan orator. He is of the same class as Mr. Kennedy,--only of course\r\nhigher in the class."\r\n\r\n"We all look for a great speech from Mr. Kennedy," said Mrs. Bonteen.\r\n\r\n"I have not the slightest idea whether he will open his lips," said\r\nLady Laura. Immediately after that Mrs. Bonteen took her leave.\r\n"I hate that woman like poison," continued Lady Laura. "She is\r\nalways playing a game, and it is such a small game that she plays!\r\nAnd she contributes so little to society. She is not witty nor\r\nwell-informed,--not even sufficiently ignorant or ridiculous to be a\r\nlaughing-stock. One gets nothing from her, and yet she has made her\r\nfooting good in the world."\r\n\r\n"I thought she was a friend of yours."\r\n\r\n"You did not think so! You could not have thought so! How can you\r\nbring such an accusation against me, knowing me as you do? But never\r\nmind Mrs. Bonteen now. On what day shall you speak?"\r\n\r\n"On Tuesday if I can."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you can arrange it?"\r\n\r\n"I shall endeavour to do so, as far as any arrangement can go."\r\n\r\n"We shall carry the second reading," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Phineas; "I think we shall; but by the votes of men who\r\nare determined so to pull the bill to pieces in committee, that its\r\nown parents will not know it. I doubt whether Mr. Mildmay will have\r\nthe temper to stand it."\r\n\r\n"They tell me that Mr. Mildmay will abandon the custody of the bill\r\nto Mr. Gresham after his first speech."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that Mr. Gresham\'s temper is more enduring than Mr.\r\nMildmay\'s," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Well;--we shall see. My own impression is that nothing would save\r\nthe country so effectually at the present moment as the removal of\r\nMr. Turnbull to a higher and a better sphere."\r\n\r\n"Let us say the House of Lords," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"God forbid!" said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\nPhineas sat there for half an hour and then got up to go, having\r\nspoken no word on any other subject than that of politics. He longed\r\nto ask after Violet. He longed to make some inquiry respecting Lord\r\nChiltern. And, to tell the truth, he felt painfully curious to\r\nhear Lady Laura say something about her own self. He could not but\r\nremember what had been said between them up over the waterfall, and\r\nhow he had been warned not to return to Loughlinter. And then again,\r\ndid Lady Laura know anything of what had passed between him and\r\nViolet? "Where is your brother?" he said, as he rose from his chair.\r\n\r\n"Oswald is in London. He was here not an hour before you came in."\r\n\r\n"Where is he staying?"\r\n\r\n"At Moroni\'s. He goes down on Tuesday, I think. He is to see his\r\nfather to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\n"By agreement?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--by agreement. There is a new trouble,--about money that they\r\nthink to be due to me. But I cannot tell you all now. There have been\r\nsome words between Mr. Kennedy and papa. But I won\'t talk about it.\r\nYou would find Oswald at Moroni\'s at any hour before eleven\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Did he say anything about me?" asked Phineas.\r\n\r\n"We mentioned your name certainly."\r\n\r\n"I do not ask from vanity, but I want to know whether he is angry\r\nwith me."\r\n\r\n"Angry with you! Not in the least. I\'ll tell you just what he said.\r\nHe said he should not wish to live even with you, but that he would\r\nsooner try it with you than with any man he ever knew."\r\n\r\n"He had got a letter from me?"\r\n\r\n"He did not say so;--but he did not say he had not."\r\n\r\n"I will see him to-morrow if I can." And then Phineas prepared to go.\r\n\r\n"One word, Mr. Finn," said Lady Laura, hardly looking him in the face\r\nand yet making an effort to do so. "I wish you to forget what I said\r\nto you at Loughlinter."\r\n\r\n"It shall be as though it were forgotten," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Let it be absolutely forgotten. In such a case a man is bound to do\r\nall that a woman asks him, and no man has a truer spirit of chivalry\r\nthan yourself. That is all. Look in when you can. I will not ask you\r\nto dine here as yet, because we are so frightfully dull. Do your best\r\non Tuesday, and then let us see you on Wednesday. Good-bye."\r\n\r\nPhineas as he walked across the park towards his club made up his\r\nmind that he would forget the scene by the waterfall. He had never\r\nquite known what it had meant, and he would wipe it away from his\r\nmind altogether. He acknowledged to himself that chivalry did demand\r\nof him that he should never allow himself to think of Lady Laura\'s\r\nrash words to him. That she was not happy with her husband was very\r\nclear to him;--but that was altogether another affair. She might be\r\nunhappy with her husband without indulging any guilty love. He had\r\nnever thought it possible that she could be happy living with such a\r\nhusband as Mr. Kennedy. All that, however, was now past remedy, and\r\nshe must simply endure the mode of life which she had prepared for\r\nherself. There were other men and women in London tied together for\r\nbetter and worse, in reference to whose union their friends knew that\r\nthere would be no better;--that it must be all worse. Lady Laura must\r\nbear it, as it was borne by many another married woman.\r\n\r\nOn the Monday morning Phineas called at Moroni\'s Hotel at ten\r\no\'clock, but in spite of Lady Laura\'s assurance to the contrary, he\r\nfound that Lord Chiltern was out. He had felt some palpitation at the\r\nheart as he made his inquiry, knowing well the fiery nature of the\r\nman he expected to see. It might be that there would be some actual\r\npersonal conflict between him and this half-mad lord before he got\r\nback again into the street. What Lady Laura had said about her\r\nbrother did not in the estimation of Phineas make this at all the\r\nless probable. The half-mad lord was so singular in his ways that it\r\nmight well be that he should speak handsomely of a rival behind his\r\nback and yet take him by the throat as soon as they were together,\r\nface to face. And yet, as Phineas thought, it was necessary that he\r\nshould see the half-mad lord. He had written a letter to which he had\r\nreceived no reply, and he considered it to be incumbent on him to\r\nask whether it had been received and whether any answer to it was\r\nintended to be given. He went therefore to Lord Chiltern at once,--as\r\nI have said, with some feeling at his heart that there might be\r\nviolence, at any rate of words, before he should find himself again\r\nin the street. But Lord Chiltern was not there. All that the porter\r\nknew was that Lord Chiltern intended to leave the house on the\r\nfollowing morning. Then Phineas wrote a note and left it with the\r\nporter.\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR CHILTERN,\r\n\r\n   I particularly want to see you with reference to a letter\r\n   I wrote to you last summer. I must be in the House to-day\r\n   from four till the debate is over. I will be at the Reform\r\n   Club from two till half-past three, and will come if you\r\n   will send for me, or I will meet you anywhere at any hour\r\n   to-morrow morning.\r\n\r\n   Yours, always, P. F.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo message came to him at the Reform Club, and he was in his seat in\r\nthe House by four o\'clock. During the debate a note was brought to\r\nhim, which ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   I have got your letter this moment. Of course we must\r\n   meet. I hunt on Tuesday, and go down by the early train;\r\n   but I will come to town on Wednesday. We shall require to\r\n   be private, and I will therefore be at your rooms at one\r\n   o\'clock on that day.--C.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhineas at once perceived that the note was a hostile note, written\r\nin an angry spirit,--written to one whom the writer did not at the\r\nmoment acknowledge to be his friend. This was certainly the case,\r\nwhatever Lord Chiltern may have said to his sister as to his\r\nfriendship for Phineas. Phineas crushed the note into his pocket, and\r\nof course determined that he would be in his rooms at the hour named.\r\n\r\nThe debate was opened by a speech from Mr. Mildmay, in which that\r\ngentleman at great length and with much perspicuity explained his\r\nnotion of that measure of Parliamentary Reform which he thought to\r\nbe necessary. He was listened to with the greatest attention to the\r\nclose,--and perhaps, at the end of his speech, with more attention\r\nthan usual, as there had gone abroad a rumour that the Prime Minister\r\nintended to declare that this would be the last effort of his life\r\nin that course. But, if he ever intended to utter such a pledge, his\r\nheart misgave him when the time came for uttering it. He merely said\r\nthat as the management of the bill in committee would be an affair\r\nof much labour, and probably spread over many nights, he would be\r\nassisted in his work by his colleagues, and especially by his right\r\nhonourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. It was\r\nthen understood that Mr. Gresham would take the lead should the bill\r\ngo into committee;--but it was understood also that no resignation of\r\nleadership had been made by Mr. Mildmay.\r\n\r\nThe measure now proposed to the House was very much the same as that\r\nwhich had been brought forward in the last session. The existing\r\ntheory of British representation was not to be changed, but the\r\nactual practice was to be brought nearer to the ideal theory. The\r\nideas of manhood suffrage, and of electoral districts, were to be as\r\nfor ever removed from the bulwarks of the British Constitution. There\r\nwere to be counties with agricultural constituencies, purposely\r\narranged to be purely agricultural, whenever the nature of the\r\ncounties would admit of its being so. No artificer at Reform, let\r\nhim be Conservative or Liberal, can make Middlesex or Lancashire\r\nagricultural; but Wiltshire and Suffolk were to be preserved\r\ninviolable to the plough,--and the apples of Devonshire were still\r\nto have their sway. Every town in the three kingdoms with a certain\r\npopulation was to have two members. But here there was much room\r\nfor cavil,--as all men knew would be the case. Who shall say what\r\nis a town, or where shall be its limits? Bits of counties might be\r\nborrowed, so as to lessen the Conservatism of the county without\r\nendangering the Liberalism of the borough. And then there were the\r\nboroughs with one member,--and then the groups of little boroughs.\r\nIn the discussion of any such arrangement how easy is the picking\r\nof holes; how impossible the fabrication of a garment that shall be\r\nimpervious to such picking! Then again there was that great question\r\nof the ballot. On that there was to be no mistake. Mr. Mildmay again\r\npledged himself to disappear from the Treasury bench should any\r\nmotion, clause, or resolution be carried by that House in favour of\r\nthe ballot. He spoke for three hours, and then left the carcass of\r\nhis bill to be fought for by the opposing armies.\r\n\r\nNo reader of these pages will desire that the speeches in the debate\r\nshould be even indicated. It soon became known that the Conservatives\r\nwould not divide the House against the second reading of the bill.\r\nThey declared, however, very plainly their intention of so altering\r\nthe clauses of the bill in committee,--or at least of attempting so\r\nto do,--as to make the bill their bill, rather than the bill of their\r\nopponents. To this Mr. Palliser replied that as long as nothing vital\r\nwas touched, the Government would only be too happy to oblige their\r\nfriends opposite. If anything vital were touched, the Government\r\ncould only fall back upon their friends on that side. And in this way\r\nmen were very civil to each other. But Mr. Turnbull, who opened the\r\ndebate on the Tuesday, thundered out an assurance to gods and men\r\nthat he would divide the House on the second reading of the bill\r\nitself. He did not doubt but that there were many good men and true\r\nto go with him into the lobby, but into the lobby he would go if he\r\nhad no more than a single friend to support him. And he warned the\r\nSovereign, and he warned the House, and he warned the people of\r\nEngland, that the measure of Reform now proposed by a so-called\r\nliberal Minister was a measure prepared in concert with the ancient\r\nenemies of the people. He was very loud, very angry, and quite\r\nsuccessful in hallooing down sundry attempts which were made to\r\ninterrupt him. "I find," he said, "that there are many members here\r\nwho do not know me yet,--young members, probably, who are green from\r\nthe waste lands and road-sides of private life. They will know me\r\nsoon, and then, may be, there will be less of this foolish noise,\r\nless of this elongation of unnecessary necks. Our Rome must be\r\naroused to a sense of its danger by other voices than these." He\r\nwas called to order, but it was ruled that he had not been out of\r\norder,--and he was very triumphant. Mr. Monk answered him, and it\r\nwas declared afterwards that Mr. Monk\'s speech was one of the finest\r\npieces of oratory that had ever been uttered in that House. He made\r\none remark personal to Mr. Turnbull. "I quite agreed with the right\r\nhonourable gentleman in the chair," he said, "when he declared that\r\nthe honourable member was not out of order just now. We all of us\r\nagree with him always on such points. The rules of our House have\r\nbeen laid down with the utmost latitude, so that the course of our\r\ndebates may not be frivolously or too easily interrupted. But a\r\nmember may be so in order as to incur the displeasure of the House,\r\nand to merit the reproaches of his countrymen." This little duel\r\ngave great life to the debate; but it was said that those two great\r\nReformers, Mr. Turnbull and Mr. Monk, could never again meet as\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the debate on Tuesday, Phineas got upon his legs.\r\nThe reader, I trust, will remember that hitherto he had failed\r\naltogether as a speaker. On one occasion he had lacked even the\r\nspirit to use and deliver an oration which he had prepared. On\r\na second occasion he had broken down,--woefully, and past all\r\nredemption, as said those who were not his friends,--unfortunately,\r\nbut not past redemption, as said those who were his true friends.\r\nAfter that once again he had arisen and said a few words which had\r\ncalled for no remark, and had been spoken as though he were in the\r\nhabit of addressing the House daily. It may be doubted whether there\r\nwere half-a-dozen men now present who recognised the fact that this\r\nman, who was so well known to so many of them, was now about to\r\nmake another attempt at a first speech. Phineas himself diligently\r\nattempted to forget that such was the case. He had prepared for\r\nhimself a few headings of what he intended to say, and on one or\r\ntwo points had arranged his words. His hope was that even though\r\nhe should forget the words, he might still be able to cling to the\r\nthread of his discourse. When he found himself again upon his legs\r\namidst those crowded seats, for a few moments there came upon him\r\nthat old sensation of awe. Again things grew dim before his eyes, and\r\nagain he hardly knew at which end of that long chamber the Speaker\r\nwas sitting. But there arose within him a sudden courage, as soon as\r\nthe sound of his own voice in that room had made itself intimate to\r\nhis ear; and after the first few sentences, all fear, all awe, was\r\ngone from him. When he read his speech in the report afterwards, he\r\nfound that he had strayed very wide of his intended course, but he\r\nhad strayed without tumbling into ditches, or falling into sunken\r\npits. He had spoken much from Mr. Monk\'s letter, but had had the\r\ngrace to acknowledge whence had come his inspiration. He hardly knew,\r\nhowever, whether he had failed again or not, till Barrington Erle\r\ncame up to him as they were leaving the House, with his old easy\r\npressing manner. "So you have got into form at last," he said. "I\r\nalways thought that it would come. I never for a moment believed\r\nbut that it would come sooner or later." Phineas Finn answered\r\nnot a word; but he went home and lay awake all night triumphant.\r\nThe verdict of Barrington Erle sufficed to assure him that he had\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nA Rough Encounter\r\n\r\n\r\nPhineas, when he woke, had two matters to occupy his mind,--his\r\nsuccess of the previous night, and his coming interview with Lord\r\nChiltern. He stayed at home the whole morning, knowing that nothing\r\ncould be done before the hour Lord Chiltern had named for his visit.\r\nHe read every word of the debate, studiously postponing the perusal\r\nof his own speech till he should come to it in due order. And then he\r\nwrote to his father, commencing his letter as though his writing had\r\nno reference to the affairs of the previous night. But he soon found\r\nhimself compelled to break into some mention of it. "I send you a\r\n_Times_," he said, "in order that you may see that I have had my\r\nfinger in the pie. I have hitherto abstained from putting myself\r\nforward in the House, partly through a base fear for which I despise\r\nmyself, and partly through a feeling of prudence that a man of my age\r\nshould not be in a hurry to gather laurels. This is literally true.\r\nThere has been the fear, and there has been the prudence. My wonder\r\nis, that I have not incurred more contempt from others because I have\r\nbeen a coward. People have been so kind to me that I must suppose\r\nthem to have judged me more leniently than I have judged myself."\r\nThen, as he was putting up the paper, he looked again at his own\r\nspeech, and of course read every word of it once more. As he did so\r\nit occurred to him that the reporters had been more than courteous to\r\nhim. The man who had followed him had been, he thought, at any rate\r\nas long-winded as himself; but to this orator less than half a column\r\nhad been granted. To him had been granted ten lines in big type, and\r\nafter that a whole column and a half. Let Lord Chiltern come and do\r\nhis worst!\r\n\r\nWhen it wanted but twenty minutes to one, and he was beginning to\r\nthink in what way he had better answer the half-mad lord, should the\r\nlord in his wrath be very mad, there came to him a note by the hand\r\nof some messenger. He knew at once that it was from Lady Laura, and\r\nopened it in hot haste It was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR MR. FINN,\r\n\r\n   We are all talking about your speech. My father was in\r\n   the gallery and heard it,--and said that he had to thank\r\n   me for sending you to Loughton. That made me very happy.\r\n   Mr. Kennedy declares that you were eloquent, but too\r\n   short. That coming from him is praise indeed. I have seen\r\n   Barrington, who takes pride to himself that you are his\r\n   political child. Violet says that it is the only speech\r\n   she ever read. I was there, and was delighted. I was sure\r\n   that it was in you to do it.\r\n\r\n   Yours, L. K.\r\n\r\n   I suppose we shall see you after the House is up, but\r\n   I write this as I shall barely have an opportunity of\r\n   speaking to you then. I shall be in Portman Square, not\r\n   at home, from six till seven.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moment in which Phineas refolded this note and put it into his\r\nbreast coat-pocket was, I think, the happiest of his life. Then,\r\nbefore he had withdrawn his hand from his breast, he remembered that\r\nwhat was now about to take place between him and Lord Chiltern would\r\nprobably be the means of separating him altogether from Lady Laura\r\nand her family. Nay, might it not render it necessary that he should\r\nabandon the seat in Parliament which had been conferred upon him by\r\nthe personal kindness of Lord Brentford? Let that be as it might. One\r\nthing was clear to him. He would not abandon Violet Effingham till\r\nhe should be desired to do so in the plainest language by Violet\r\nEffingham herself. Looking at his watch he saw that it was one\r\no\'clock, and at that moment Lord Chiltern was announced.\r\n\r\nPhineas went forward immediately with his hand out to meet his\r\nvisitor. "Chiltern," he said, "I am very glad to see you." But Lord\r\nChiltern did not take his hand. Passing on to the table, with his hat\r\nstill on his head, and with a dark scowl upon his brow, the young\r\nlord stood for a few moments perfectly silent. Then he chucked a\r\nletter across the table to the spot at which Phineas was standing.\r\nPhineas, taking up the letter, perceived that it was that which\r\nhe, in his great attempt to be honest, had written from the inn at\r\nLoughton. "It is my own letter to you," he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes; it is your letter to me. I received it oddly enough together\r\nwith your own note at Moroni\'s,--on Monday morning. It has been\r\nround the world, I suppose, and reached me only then. You must\r\nwithdraw it."\r\n\r\n"Withdraw it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, withdraw it. As far as I can learn, without asking any\r\nquestion which would have committed myself or the young lady, you\r\nhave not acted upon it. You have not yet done what you there threaten\r\nto do. In that you have been very wise, and there can be no\r\ndifficulty in your withdrawing the letter."\r\n\r\n"I certainly shall not withdraw it, Lord Chiltern."\r\n\r\n"Do you remember--what--I once--told you,--about myself and Miss\r\nEffingham?" This question he asked very slowly, pausing between the\r\nwords, and looking full into the face of his rival, towards whom he\r\nhad gradually come nearer. And his countenance, as he did so, was\r\nby no means pleasant. The redness of his complexion had become more\r\nruddy than usual; he still wore his hat as though with studied\r\ninsolence; his right hand was clenched; and there was that look of\r\nangry purpose in his eye which no man likes to see in the eye of an\r\nantagonist. Phineas was afraid of no violence, personal to himself;\r\nbut he was afraid of,--of what I may, perhaps, best call "a row."\r\nTo be tumbling over the chairs and tables with his late friend and\r\npresent enemy in Mrs. Bunce\'s room would be most unpleasant to him.\r\nIf there were to be blows he, too, must strike;--and he was very\r\naverse to strike Lady Laura\'s brother, Lord Brentford\'s son, Violet\r\nEffingham\'s friend. If need be, however, he would strike.\r\n\r\n"I suppose I remember what you mean," said Phineas. "I think you\r\ndeclared that you would quarrel with any man who might presume to\r\naddress Miss Effingham. Is it that to which you allude?"\r\n\r\n"It is that," said Lord Chiltern.\r\n\r\n"I remember what you said very well. If nothing else was to deter me\r\nfrom asking Miss Effingham to be my wife, you will hardly think that\r\nthat ought to have any weight. The threat had no weight."\r\n\r\n"It was not spoken as a threat, sir, and that you know as well as I\r\ndo. It was said from a friend to a friend,--as I thought then. But it\r\nis not the less true. I wonder what you can think of faith and truth\r\nand honesty of purpose when you took advantage of my absence,--you,\r\nwhom I had told a thousand times that I loved her better than my own\r\nsoul! You stand before the world as a rising man, and I stand before\r\nthe world as a man--damned. You have been chosen by my father to sit\r\nfor our family borough, while I am an outcast from his house. You\r\nhave Cabinet Ministers for your friends, while I have hardly a decent\r\nassociate left to me in the world. But I can say of myself that I\r\nhave never done anything unworthy of a gentleman, while this thing\r\nthat you are doing is unworthy of the lowest man."\r\n\r\n"I have done nothing unworthy," said Phineas. "I wrote to you\r\ninstantly when I had resolved,--though it was painful to me to have\r\nto tell such a secret to any one."\r\n\r\n"You wrote! Yes; when I was miles distant; weeks, months away. But I\r\ndid not come here to bullyrag like an old woman. I got your letter\r\nonly on Monday, and know nothing of what has occurred. Is Miss\r\nEffingham to be--your wife?" Lord Chiltern had now come quite close\r\nto Phineas, and Phineas felt that that clenched fist might be in his\r\nface in half a moment. Miss Effingham of course was not engaged to\r\nhim, but it seemed to him that if he were now so to declare, such\r\ndeclaration would appear to have been drawn from him by fear. "I ask\r\nyou," said Lord Chiltern, "in what position you now stand towards\r\nMiss Effingham. If you are not a coward you will tell me."\r\n\r\n"Whether I tell you or not, you know that I am not a coward," said\r\nPhineas.\r\n\r\n"I shall have to try," said Lord Chiltern. "But if you please I will\r\nask you for an answer to my question."\r\n\r\nPhineas paused for a moment, thinking what honesty of purpose and\r\na high spirit would, when combined together, demand of him, and\r\ntogether with these requirements he felt that he was bound to join\r\nsome feeling of duty towards Miss Effingham. Lord Chiltern was\r\nstanding there, fiery red, with his hand still clenched, and his hat\r\nstill on, waiting for his answer. "Let me have your question again,"\r\nsaid Phineas, "and I will answer it if I find that I can do so\r\nwithout loss of self-respect."\r\n\r\n"I ask you in what position you stand towards Miss Effingham. Mind,\r\nI do not doubt at all, but I choose to have a reply from yourself."\r\n\r\n"You will remember, of course, that I can only answer to the best of\r\nmy belief."\r\n\r\n"Answer to the best of your belief."\r\n\r\n"I think she regards me as an intimate friend."\r\n\r\n"Had you said as an indifferent acquaintance, you would, I think,\r\nhave been nearer the mark. But we will let that be. I presume I\r\nmay understand that you have given up any idea of changing that\r\nposition?"\r\n\r\n"You may understand nothing of the kind, Lord Chiltern."\r\n\r\n"Why;--what hope have you?"\r\n\r\n"That is another thing. I shall not speak of that;--at any rate not\r\nto you."\r\n\r\n"Then, sir,--" and now Lord Chiltern advanced another step and raised\r\nhis hand as though he were about to put it with some form of violence\r\non the person of his rival.\r\n\r\n"Stop, Chiltern," said Phineas, stepping back, so that there was some\r\narticle of furniture between him and his adversary. "I do not choose\r\nthat there should be a riot here."\r\n\r\n"What do you call a riot, sir? I believe that after all you are a\r\npoltroon. What I require of you is that you shall meet me. Will you\r\ndo that?"\r\n\r\n"You mean,--to fight?"\r\n\r\n"Yes,--to fight; to fight; to fight. For what other purpose do you\r\nsuppose that I can wish to meet you?" Phineas felt at the moment that\r\nthe fighting of a duel would be destructive to all his political\r\nhopes. Few Englishmen fight duels in these days. They who do so\r\nare always reckoned to be fools. And a duel between him and Lord\r\nBrentford\'s son must, as he thought, separate him from Violet, from\r\nLady Laura, from Lord Brentford, and from his borough. But yet how\r\ncould he refuse? "What have you to think of, sir, when such an offer\r\nas that is made to you?" said the fiery-red lord.\r\n\r\n"I have to think whether I have courage enough to refuse to make\r\nmyself an ass."\r\n\r\n"You say that you do not wish to have a riot. That is your way to\r\nescape what you call--a riot."\r\n\r\n"You want to bully me, Chiltern."\r\n\r\n"No, sir;--I simply want this, that you should leave me where you\r\nfound me, and not interfere with that which you have long known I\r\nclaim as my own."\r\n\r\n"But it is not your own."\r\n\r\n"Then you can only fight me."\r\n\r\n"You had better send some friend to me, and I will name some one,\r\nwhom he shall meet."\r\n\r\n"Of course I will do that if I have your promise to meet me. We\r\ncan be in Belgium in an hour or two, and back again in a few more\r\nhours;--that is, any one of us who may chance to be alive.\r\n\r\n"I will select a friend, and will tell him everything, and will then\r\ndo as he bids me."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--some old steady-going buffer. Mr. Kennedy, perhaps."\r\n\r\n"It will certainly not be Mr. Kennedy. I shall probably ask Laurence\r\nFitzgibbon to manage for me in such an affair."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you will see him at once, then, so that Colepepper may\r\narrange with him this afternoon. And let me assure you, Mr. Finn,\r\nthat there will be a meeting between us after some fashion, let the\r\nideas of your friend Mr. Fitzgibbon be what they may." Then Lord\r\nChiltern purposed to go, but turned again as he was going. "And\r\nremember this," he said, "my complaint is that you have been false to\r\nme,--damnably false; not that you have fallen in love with this young\r\nlady or with that." Then the fiery-red lord opened the door for\r\nhimself and took his departure.\r\n\r\nPhineas, as soon as he was alone, walked down to the House, at which\r\nthere was an early sitting. As he went there was one great question\r\nwhich he had to settle with himself,--Was there any justice in the\r\ncharge made against him that he had been false to his friend? When he\r\nhad thought over the matter at Saulsby, after rushing down there that\r\nhe might throw himself at Violet\'s feet, he had assured himself that\r\nsuch a letter as that which he resolved to write to Lord Chiltern,\r\nwould be even chivalrous in its absolute honesty. He would tell his\r\npurpose to Lord Chiltern the moment that his purpose was formed;--and\r\nwould afterwards speak of Lord Chiltern behind his back as one\r\ndear friend should speak of another. Had Miss Effingham shown the\r\nslightest intention of accepting Lord Chiltern\'s offer, he would have\r\nacknowledged to himself that the circumstances of his position made\r\nit impossible that he should, with honour, become his friend\'s rival.\r\nBut was he to be debarred for ever from getting that which he wanted\r\nbecause Lord Chiltern wanted it also,--knowing, as he did so well,\r\nthat Lord Chiltern could not get the thing which he wanted? All this\r\nhad been quite sufficient for him at Saulsby. But now the charge\r\nagainst him that he had been false to his friend rang in his ears and\r\nmade him unhappy. It certainly was true that Lord Chiltern had not\r\ngiven up his hopes, and that he had spoken probably more openly to\r\nPhineas respecting them than he had done to any other human being. If\r\nit was true that he had been false, then he must comply with any\r\nrequisition which Lord Chiltern might make,--short of voluntarily\r\ngiving up the lady. He must fight if he were asked to do so, even\r\nthough fighting were his ruin.\r\n\r\nWhen again in the House yesterday\'s scene came back upon him, and\r\nmore than one man came to him congratulating him. Mr. Monk took his\r\nhand and spoke a word to him. The old Premier nodded to him. Mr.\r\nGresham greeted him; and Plantagenet Palliser openly told him that\r\nhe had made a good speech. How sweet would all this have been had\r\nthere not been ever at his heart the remembrance of his terrible\r\ndifficulty,--the consciousness that he was about to be forced into\r\nan absurdity which would put an end to all this sweetness! Why was\r\nthe world in England so severe against duelling? After all, as he\r\nregarded the matter now, a duel might be the best way, nay, the only\r\nway out of a difficulty. If he might only be allowed to go out with\r\nLord Chiltern the whole thing might be arranged. If he were not shot\r\nhe might carry on his suit with Miss Effingham unfettered by any\r\nimpediment on that side. And if he were shot, what matter was that\r\nto any one but himself? Why should the world be so thin-skinned,--so\r\nfoolishly chary of human life?\r\n\r\nLaurence Fitzgibbon did not come to the House, and Phineas looked for\r\nhim at both the clubs which he frequented,--leaving a note at each as\r\nhe did not find him. He also left a note for him at his lodgings in\r\nDuke Street. "I must see you this evening. I shall dine at the Reform\r\nClub,--pray come there." After that, Phineas went up to Portman\r\nSquare, in accordance with the instructions received from Lady Laura.\r\n\r\nThere he saw Violet Effingham, meeting her for the first time since\r\nhe had parted from her on the great steps at Saulsby. Of course\r\nhe spoke to her, and of course she was gracious to him. But her\r\ngraciousness was only a smile and his speech was only a word. There\r\nwere many in the room, but not enough to make privacy possible,--as\r\nit becomes possible at a crowded evening meeting. Lord Brentford\r\nwas there, and the Bonteens, and Barrington Erle, and Lady Glencora\r\nPalliser, and Lord Cantrip with his young wife. It was manifestly a\r\nmeeting of Liberals, semi-social and semi-political;--so arranged\r\nthat ladies might feel that some interest in politics was allowed\r\nto them, and perhaps some influence also. Afterwards Mr. Palliser\r\nhimself came in. Phineas, however, was most struck by finding that\r\nLaurence Fitzgibbon was there, and that Mr. Kennedy was not. In\r\nregard to Mr. Kennedy, he was quite sure that had such a meeting\r\ntaken place before Lady Laura\'s marriage, Mr. Kennedy would have\r\nbeen present. "I must speak to you as we go away," said Phineas,\r\nwhispering a word into Fitzgibbon\'s ear. "I have been leaving notes\r\nfor you all about the town." "Not a duel, I hope," said Fitzgibbon.\r\n\r\nHow pleasant it was,--that meeting; or would have been had there not\r\nbeen that nightmare on his breast! They all talked as though there\r\nwere perfect accord between them and perfect confidence. There were\r\nthere great men,--Cabinet Ministers, and beautiful women,--the wives\r\nand daughters of some of England\'s highest nobles. And Phineas Finn,\r\nthrowing back, now and again, a thought to Killaloe, found himself\r\namong them as one of themselves. How could any Mr. Low say that he\r\nwas wrong?\r\n\r\nOn a sofa near to him, so that he could almost touch her foot with\r\nhis, was sitting Violet Effingham, and as he leaned over from his\r\nchair discussing some point in Mr. Mildmay\'s bill with that most\r\ninveterate politician, Lady Glencora, Violet looked into his face and\r\nsmiled. Oh heavens! If Lord Chiltern and he might only toss up as to\r\nwhich of them should go to Patagonia and remain there for the next\r\nten years, and which should have Violet Effingham for a wife in\r\nLondon!\r\n\r\n"Come along, Phineas, if you mean to come," said Laurence Fitzgibbon.\r\nPhineas was of course bound to go, though Lady Glencora was still\r\ntalking Radicalism, and Violet Effingham was still smiling ineffably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME II\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nThe Duel\r\n\r\n\r\n"I knew it was a duel;--bedad I did," said Laurence Fitzgibbon,\r\nstanding at the corner of Orchard Street and Oxford Street, when\r\nPhineas had half told his story. "I was sure of it from the tone of\r\nyour voice, my boy. We mustn\'t let it come off, that\'s all;--not\r\nif we can help it." Then Phineas was allowed to proceed and finish\r\nhis story. "I don\'t see any way out of it; I don\'t, indeed," said\r\nLaurence. By this time Phineas had come to think that the duel was in\r\nvery truth the best way out of the difficulty. It was a bad way out,\r\nbut then it was a way;--and he could not see any other. "As for ill\r\ntreating him, that\'s nonsense," said Laurence. "What are the girls to\r\ndo, if one fellow mayn\'t come on as soon as another fellow is down?\r\nBut then, you see, a fellow never knows when he\'s down himself, and\r\ntherefore he thinks that he\'s ill used. I\'ll tell you what now. I\r\nshouldn\'t wonder if we couldn\'t do it on the sly,--unless one of you\r\nis stupid enough to hit the other in an awkward place. If you are\r\ncertain of your hand now, the right shoulder is the best spot."\r\nPhineas felt very certain that he would not hit Lord Chiltern in an\r\nawkward place, although he was by no means sure of his hand. Let come\r\nwhat might, he would not aim at his adversary. But of this he had\r\nthought it proper to say nothing to Laurence Fitzgibbon.\r\n\r\nAnd the duel did come off on the sly. The meeting in the drawing-room\r\nin Portman Square, of which mention was made in the last chapter,\r\ntook place on a Wednesday afternoon. On the Thursday, Friday, Monday,\r\nand Tuesday following, the great debate on Mr. Mildmay\'s bill was\r\ncontinued, and at three on the Tuesday night the House divided. There\r\nwas a majority in favour of the Ministers, not large enough to permit\r\nthem to claim a triumph for their party, or even an ovation for\r\nthemselves; but still sufficient to enable them to send their bill\r\ninto committee. Mr. Daubeny and Mr. Turnbull had again joined\r\ntheir forces together in opposition to the ministerial measure. On\r\nthe Thursday Phineas had shown himself in the House, but during\r\nthe remainder of this interesting period he was absent from his\r\nplace, nor was he seen at the clubs, nor did any man know of his\r\nwhereabouts. I think that Lady Laura Kennedy was the first to miss\r\nhim with any real sense of his absence. She would now go to Portman\r\nSquare on the afternoon of every Sunday,--at which time her husband\r\nwas attending the second service of his church,--and there she would\r\nreceive those whom she called her father\'s guests. But as her father\r\nwas never there on the Sundays, and as these gatherings had been\r\ncreated by herself, the reader will probably think that she was\r\nobeying her husband\'s behests in regard to the Sabbath after a very\r\nindifferent fashion. The reader may be quite sure, however, that Mr.\r\nKennedy knew well what was being done in Portman Square. Whatever\r\nmight be Lady Laura\'s faults, she did not commit the fault of\r\ndisobeying her husband in secret. There were, probably, a few words\r\non the subject; but we need not go very closely into that matter at\r\nthe present moment.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday which afforded some rest in the middle of the great\r\nReform debate Lady Laura asked for Mr. Finn, and no one could answer\r\nher question. And then it was remembered that Laurence Fitzgibbon\r\nwas also absent. Barrington Erle knew nothing of Phineas,--had heard\r\nnothing; but was able to say that Fitzgibbon had been with Mr.\r\nRatler, the patronage secretary and liberal whip, early on Thursday,\r\nexpressing his intention of absenting himself for two days. Mr.\r\nRatler had been wroth, bidding him remain at his duty, and pointing\r\nout to him the great importance of the moment. Then Barrington Erle\r\nquoted Laurence Fitzgibbon\'s reply. "My boy," said Laurence to poor\r\nRatler, "the path of duty leads but to the grave. All the same; I\'ll\r\nbe in at the death, Ratler, my boy, as sure as the sun\'s in heaven."\r\nNot ten minutes after the telling of this little story, Fitzgibbon\r\nentered the room in Portman Square, and Lady Laura at once asked him\r\nafter Phineas. "Bedad, Lady Laura, I have been out of town myself for\r\ntwo days, and I know nothing."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Finn has not been with you, then?"\r\n\r\n"With me! No,--not with me. I had a job of business of my own which\r\ntook me over to Paris. And has Phinny fled too? Poor Ratler! I\r\nshouldn\'t wonder if it isn\'t an asylum he\'s in before the session is\r\nover."\r\n\r\nLaurence Fitzgibbon certainly possessed the rare accomplishment of\r\ntelling a lie with a good grace. Had any man called him a liar he\r\nwould have considered himself to be not only insulted, but injured\r\nalso. He believed himself to be a man of truth. There were, however,\r\nin his estimation certain subjects on which a man might depart as\r\nwide as the poles are asunder from truth without subjecting himself\r\nto any ignominy for falsehood. In dealing with a tradesman as to his\r\ndebts, or with a rival as to a lady, or with any man or woman in\r\ndefence of a lady\'s character, or in any such matter as that of a\r\nduel, Laurence believed that a gentleman was bound to lie, and that\r\nhe would be no gentleman if he hesitated to do so. Not the slightest\r\nprick of conscience disturbed him when he told Lady Laura that he\r\nhad been in Paris, and that he knew nothing of Phineas Finn. But, in\r\ntruth, during the last day or two he had been in Flanders, and not in\r\nParis, and had stood as second with his friend Phineas on the sands\r\nat Blankenberg, a little fishing-town some twelve miles distant\r\nfrom Bruges, and had left his friend since that at an hotel at\r\nOstend,--with a wound just under the shoulder, from which a bullet\r\nhad been extracted.\r\n\r\nThe manner of the meeting had been in this wise. Captain Colepepper\r\nand Laurence Fitzgibbon had held their meeting, and at this meeting\r\nLaurence had taken certain standing-ground on behalf of his friend,\r\nand in obedience to his friend\'s positive instruction;--which was\r\nthis, that his friend could not abandon his right of addressing the\r\nyoung lady, should he hereafter ever think fit to do so. Let that\r\nbe granted, and Laurence would do anything. But then that could not\r\nbe granted, and Laurence could only shrug his shoulders. Nor would\r\nLaurence admit that his friend had been false. "The question lies in\r\na nutshell," said Laurence, with that sweet Connaught brogue which\r\nalways came to him when he desired to be effective;--"here it is. One\r\ngentleman tells another that he\'s sweet upon a young lady, but that\r\nthe young lady has refused him, and always will refuse him, for ever\r\nand ever. That\'s the truth anyhow. Is the second gentleman bound by\r\nthat not to address the young lady? I say he is not bound. It\'d be a\r\nd----d hard tratement, Captain Colepepper, if a man\'s mouth and all\r\nthe ardent affections of his heart were to be stopped in that manner!\r\nBy Jases, I don\'t know who\'d like to be the friend of any man if\r\nthat\'s to be the way of it."\r\n\r\nCaptain Colepepper was not very good at an argument. "I think they\'d\r\nbetter see each other," said Colepepper, pulling his thick grey\r\nmoustache.\r\n\r\n"If you choose to have it so, so be it. But I think it the hardest\r\nthing in the world;--I do indeed." Then they put their heads together\r\nin the most friendly way, and declared that the affair should, if\r\npossible, be kept private.\r\n\r\nOn the Thursday night Lord Chiltern and Captain Colepepper went over\r\nby Calais and Lille to Bruges. Laurence Fitzgibbon, with his friend\r\nDr. O\'Shaughnessy, crossed by the direct boat from Dover to Ostend.\r\nPhineas went to Ostend by Dover and Calais, but he took the day\r\nroute on Friday. It had all been arranged among them, so that there\r\nmight be no suspicion as to the job in hand. Even O\'Shaughnessy and\r\nLaurence Fitzgibbon had left London by separate trains. They met on\r\nthe sands at Blankenberg about nine o\'clock on the Saturday morning,\r\nhaving reached that village in different vehicles from Ostend and\r\nBruges, and had met quite unobserved amidst the sand-heaps. But one\r\nshot had been exchanged, and Phineas had been wounded in the right\r\nshoulder. He had proposed to exchange another shot with his left\r\nhand, declaring his capability of shooting quite as well with the\r\nleft as with the right; but to this both Colepepper and Fitzgibbon\r\nhad objected. Lord Chiltern had offered to shake hands with his late\r\nfriend in a true spirit of friendship, if only his late friend would\r\nsay that he did not intend to prosecute his suit with the young lady.\r\nIn all these disputes the young lady\'s name was never mentioned.\r\nPhineas indeed had not once named Violet to Fitzgibbon, speaking of\r\nher always as the lady in question; and though Laurence correctly\r\nsurmised the identity of the young lady, he never hinted that he had\r\neven guessed her name. I doubt whether Lord Chiltern had been so wary\r\nwhen alone with Captain Colepepper; but then Lord Chiltern was, when\r\nhe spoke at all, a very plain-spoken man. Of course his lordship\'s\r\nlate friend Phineas would give no such pledge, and therefore Lord\r\nChiltern moved off the ground and back to Blankenberg and Bruges, and\r\ninto Brussels, in still living enmity with our hero. Laurence and the\r\ndoctor took Phineas back to Ostend, and though the bullet was then in\r\nhis shoulder, Phineas made his way through Blankenberg after such a\r\nfashion that no one there knew what had occurred. Not a living soul,\r\nexcept the five concerned, was at that time aware that a duel had\r\nbeen fought among the sand-hills.\r\n\r\nLaurence Fitzgibbon made his way to Dover by the Saturday night\'s\r\nboat, and was able to show himself in Portman Square on the Sunday.\r\n"Know anything about Phinny Finn?" he said afterwards to Barrington\r\nErle, in answer to an inquiry from that anxious gentleman. "Not\r\na word! I think you\'d better send the town-crier round after\r\nhim." Barrington, however, did not feel quite so well assured of\r\nFitzgibbon\'s truth as Lady Laura had done.\r\n\r\nDr. O\'Shaughnessy remained during the Sunday and Monday at Ostend\r\nwith his patient, and the people at the inn only knew that Mr. Finn\r\nhad sprained his shoulder badly; and on the Tuesday they came back\r\nto London again, via Calais and Dover. No bone had been broken, and\r\nPhineas, though his shoulder was very painful, bore the journey well.\r\nO\'Shaughnessy had received a telegram on the Monday, telling him that\r\nthe division would certainly take place on the Tuesday,--and on the\r\nTuesday, at about ten in the evening, Phineas went down to the House.\r\n"By ----, you\'re here," said Ratler, taking hold of him with an\r\naffection that was too warm. "Yes; I\'m here," said Phineas, wincing\r\nin agony; "but be a little careful, there\'s a good fellow. I\'ve been\r\ndown in Kent and put my arm out."\r\n\r\n"Put your arm out, have you?" said Ratler, observing the sling for\r\nthe first time. "I\'m sorry for that. But you\'ll stop and vote?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I\'ll stop and vote. I\'ve come up for the purpose. But I hope\r\nit won\'t be very late."\r\n\r\n"There are both Daubeny and Gresham to speak yet, and at least three\r\nothers. I don\'t suppose it will be much before three. But you\'re\r\nall right now. You can go down and smoke if you like!" In this way\r\nPhineas Finn spoke in the debate, and heard the end of it, voting for\r\nhis party, and fought his duel with Lord Chiltern in the middle of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe did go and sit on a well-cushioned bench in the smoking-room, and\r\nthen was interrogated by many of his friends as to his mysterious\r\nabsence. He had, he said, been down in Kent, and had had an accident\r\nwith his arm, by which he had been confined. When this questioner and\r\nthat perceived that there was some little mystery in the matter, the\r\nquestioners did not push their questions, but simply entertained\r\ntheir own surmises. One indiscreet questioner, however, did trouble\r\nPhineas sorely, declaring that there must have been some affair in\r\nwhich a woman had had a part, and asking after the young lady of\r\nKent. This indiscreet questioner was Laurence Fitzgibbon, who, as\r\nPhineas thought, carried his spirit of intrigue a little too far.\r\nPhineas stayed and voted, and then he went painfully home to his\r\nlodgings.\r\n\r\nHow singular would it be if this affair of the duel should pass away,\r\nand no one be a bit the wiser but those four men who had been with\r\nhim on the sands at Blankenberg! Again he wondered at his own luck.\r\nHe had told himself that a duel with Lord Chiltern must create\r\na quarrel between him and Lord Chiltern\'s relations, and also\r\nbetween him and Violet Effingham; that it must banish him from\r\nhis comfortable seat for Loughton, and ruin him in regard to his\r\npolitical prospects. And now he had fought his duel, and was back in\r\ntown,--and the thing seemed to have been a thing of nothing. He had\r\nnot as yet seen Lady Laura or Violet, but he had no doubt but they\r\nboth were as much in the dark as other people. The day might arrive,\r\nhe thought, on which it would be pleasant for him to tell Violet\r\nEffingham what had occurred, but that day had not come as yet.\r\nWhither Lord Chiltern had gone, or what Lord Chiltern intended to\r\ndo, he had not any idea; but he imagined that he should soon hear\r\nsomething of her brother from Lady Laura. That Lord Chiltern should\r\nsay a word to Lady Laura of what had occurred,--or to any other\r\nperson in the world,--he did not in the least suspect. There could\r\nbe no man more likely to be reticent in such matters than Lord\r\nChiltern,--or more sure to be guided by an almost exaggerated sense\r\nof what honour required of him. Nor did he doubt the discretion of\r\nhis friend Fitzgibbon;--if only his friend might not damage the\r\nsecret by being too discreet. Of the silence of the doctor and the\r\ncaptain he was by no means equally sure; but even though they should\r\ngossip, the gossiping would take so long a time in oozing out and\r\nbecoming recognised information, as to have lost much of its power\r\nfor injuring him. Were Lady Laura to hear at this moment that he\r\nhad been over to Belgium, and had fought a duel with Lord Chiltern\r\nrespecting Violet, she would probably feel herself obliged to quarrel\r\nwith him; but no such obligation would rest on her, if in the course\r\nof six or nine months she should gradually have become aware that\r\nsuch an encounter had taken place.\r\n\r\nLord Chiltern, during their interview at the rooms in Great\r\nMarlborough Street, had said a word to him about the seat in\r\nParliament;--had expressed some opinion that as he, Phineas Finn, was\r\ninterfering with the views of the Standish family in regard to Miss\r\nEffingham, he ought not to keep the Standish seat, which had been\r\nconferred upon him in ignorance of any such intended interference.\r\nPhineas, as he thought of this, could not remember Lord Chiltern\'s\r\nwords, but there was present to him an idea that such had been their\r\npurport. Was he bound, in circumstances as they now existed, to give\r\nup Loughton? He made up his mind that he was not so bound unless\r\nLord Chiltern should demand from him that he should do so; but,\r\nnevertheless, he was uneasy in his position. It was quite true that\r\nthe seat now was his for this session by all parliamentary law, even\r\nthough the electors themselves might wish to be rid of him, and that\r\nLord Brentford could not even open his mouth upon the matter in a\r\ntone more loud than that of a whisper. But Phineas, feeling that\r\nhe had consented to accept the favour of a corrupt seat from Lord\r\nBrentford, felt also that he was bound to give up the spoil if it\r\nwere demanded from him. If it were demanded from him, either by the\r\nfather or the son, it should be given up at once.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning he found a leading article in the _People\'s\r\nBanner_ devoted solely to himself. "During the late debate,"--so ran\r\na passage in the leading article,--"Mr. Finn, Lord Brentford\'s Irish\r\nnominee for his pocket-borough at Loughton, did at last manage to\r\nstand on his legs and open his mouth. If we are not mistaken, this\r\nis Mr. Finn\'s third session in Parliament, and hitherto he has been\r\nunable to articulate three sentences, though he has on more than one\r\noccasion made the attempt. For what special merit this young man has\r\nbeen selected for aristocratic patronage we do not know,--but that\r\nthere must be some merit recognisable by aristocratic eyes, we\r\nsurmise. Three years ago he was a raw young Irishman, living in\r\nLondon as Irishmen only know how to live, earning nothing, and\r\napparently without means; and then suddenly he bursts out as a member\r\nof Parliament and as the friend of Cabinet Ministers. The possession\r\nof one good gift must be acceded to the honourable member for\r\nLoughton,--he is a handsome young man, and looks to be as strong as\r\na coal-porter. Can it be that his promotion has sprung from this? Be\r\nthis as it may, we should like to know where he has been during his\r\nlate mysterious absence from Parliament, and in what way he came by\r\nthe wound in his arm. Even handsome young members of Parliament,\r\nfeted by titled ladies and their rich lords, are amenable to the\r\nlaws,--to the laws of this country, and to the laws of any other\r\nwhich it may suit them to visit for a while!"\r\n\r\n"Infamous scoundrel!" said Phineas to himself, as he read this.\r\n"Vile, low, disreputable blackguard!" It was clear enough, however,\r\nthat Quintus Slide had found out something of his secret. If so, his\r\nonly hope would rest on the fact that his friends were not likely to\r\nsee the columns of the _People\'s Banner_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nLady Laura Is Told\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time that Mr. Mildmay\'s great bill was going into committee\r\nPhineas was able to move about London in comfort,--with his arm,\r\nhowever, still in a sling. There had been nothing more about him and\r\nhis wound in the _People\'s Banner_, and he was beginning to hope that\r\nthat nuisance would also be allowed to die away. He had seen Lady\r\nLaura,--having dined in Grosvenor Place, where he had been petted\r\nto his heart\'s content. His dinner had been cut up for him, and his\r\nwound had been treated with the tenderest sympathy. And, singular to\r\nsay, no questions were asked. He had been to Kent and had come by\r\nan accident. No more than that was told, and his dear sympathising\r\nfriends were content to receive so much information, and to ask for\r\nno more. But he had not as yet seen Violet Effingham, and he was\r\nbeginning to think that this romance about Violet might as well be\r\nbrought to a close. He had not, however, as yet been able to go into\r\ncrowded rooms, and unless he went out to large parties he could not\r\nbe sure that he would meet Miss Effingham.\r\n\r\nAt last he resolved that he would tell Lady Laura the whole\r\ntruth,--not the truth about the duel, but the truth about Violet\r\nEffingham, and ask for her assistance. When making this resolution, I\r\nthink that he must have forgotten much that he had learned of his\r\nfriend\'s character; and by making it, I think that he showed also\r\nthat he had not learned as much as his opportunities might have\r\ntaught him. He knew Lady Laura\'s obstinacy of purpose, he knew her\r\ndevotion to her brother, and he knew also how desirous she had been\r\nthat her brother should win Violet Effingham for himself. This\r\nknowledge should, I think, have sufficed to show him how improbable\r\nit was that Lady Laura should assist him in his enterprise. But\r\nbeyond all this was the fact,--a fact as to the consequences of which\r\nPhineas himself was entirely blind, beautifully ignorant,--that Lady\r\nLaura had once condescended to love himself. Nay;--she had gone\r\nfarther than this, and had ventured to tell him, even after her\r\nmarriage, that the remembrance of some feeling that had once dwelt in\r\nher heart in regard to him was still a danger to her. She had warned\r\nhim from Loughlinter, and then had received him in London;--and now\r\nhe selected her as his confidante in this love affair! Had he not\r\nbeen beautifully ignorant and most modestly blind, he would surely\r\nhave placed his confidence elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt was not that Lady Laura Kennedy ever confessed to herself the\r\nexistence of a vicious passion. She had, indeed, learned to tell\r\nherself that she could not love her husband; and once, in the\r\nexcitement of such silent announcements to herself, she had asked\r\nherself whether her heart was quite a blank, and had answered herself\r\nby desiring Phineas Finn to absent himself from Loughlinter. During\r\nall the subsequent winter she had scourged herself inwardly for her\r\nown imprudence, her quite unnecessary folly in so doing. What! could\r\nnot she, Laura Standish, who from her earliest years of girlish\r\nwomanhood had resolved that she would use the world as men use it,\r\nand not as women do,--could not she have felt the slight shock of\r\na passing tenderness for a handsome youth without allowing the\r\nfeeling to be a rock before her big enough and sharp enough for the\r\ndestruction of her entire barque? Could not she command, if not her\r\nheart, at any rate her mind, so that she might safely assure herself\r\nthat, whether this man or any man was here or there, her course would\r\nbe unaltered? What though Phineas Finn had been in the same house\r\nwith her throughout all the winter, could not she have so lived with\r\nhim on terms of friendship, that every deed and word and look of her\r\nfriendship might have been open to her husband,--or open to all\r\nthe world? She could have done so. She told herself that that was\r\nnot,--need not have been her great calamity. Whether she could endure\r\nthe dull, monotonous control of her slow but imperious lord,--or\r\nwhether she must not rather tell him that it was not to be\r\nendured,--that was her trouble. So she told herself, and again\r\nadmitted Phineas to her intimacy in London. But, nevertheless,\r\nPhineas, had he not been beautifully ignorant and most blind to his\r\nown achievements, would not have expected from Lady Laura Kennedy\r\nassistance with Miss Violet Effingham.\r\n\r\nPhineas knew when to find Lady Laura alone, and he came upon her one\r\nday at the favourable hour. The two first clauses of the bill had\r\nbeen passed after twenty fights and endless divisions. Two points had\r\nbeen settled, as to which, however, Mr. Gresham had been driven to\r\ngive way so far and to yield so much, that men declared that such\r\na bill as the Government could consent to call its own could never\r\nbe passed by that Parliament in that session. Immediately on his\r\nentrance into her room Lady Laura began about the third clause. Would\r\nthe House let Mr. Gresham have his way about the--? Phineas stopped\r\nher at once. "My dear friend," he said, "I have come to you in a\r\nprivate trouble, and I want you to drop politics for half an hour. I\r\nhave come to you for help."\r\n\r\n"A private trouble, Mr. Finn! Is it serious?"\r\n\r\n"It is very serious,--but it is no trouble of the kind of which you\r\nare thinking. But it is serious enough to take up every thought."\r\n\r\n"Can I help you?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed you can. Whether you will or no is a different thing."\r\n\r\n"I would help you in anything in my power, Mr. Finn. Do you not know\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"You have been very kind to me!"\r\n\r\n"And so would Mr. Kennedy."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Kennedy cannot help me here."\r\n\r\n"What is it, Mr. Finn?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose I may as well tell you at once,--in plain language, I do\r\nnot know how to put my story into words that shall fit it. I love\r\nViolet Effingham. Will you help me to win her to be my wife?"\r\n\r\n"You love Violet Effingham!" said Lady Laura. And as she spoke the\r\nlook of her countenance towards him was so changed that he became at\r\nonce aware that from her no assistance might be expected. His eyes\r\nwere not opened in any degree to the second reason above given for\r\nLady Laura\'s opposition to his wishes, but he instantly perceived\r\nthat she would still cling to that destination of Violet\'s hand which\r\nhad for years past been the favourite scheme of her life. "Have you\r\nnot always known, Mr. Finn, what have been our hopes for Violet?"\r\n\r\nPhineas, though he had perceived his mistake, felt that he must go\r\non with his cause. Lady Laura must know his wishes sooner or later,\r\nand it was as well that she should learn them in this way as in\r\nany other. "Yes;--but I have known also, from your brother\'s own\r\nlips,--and indeed from yours also, Lady Laura,--that Chiltern has\r\nbeen three times refused by Miss Effingham."\r\n\r\n"What does that matter? Do men never ask more than three times?"\r\n\r\n"And must I be debarred for ever while he prosecutes a hopeless\r\nsuit?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--you of all men."\r\n\r\n"Why so, Lady Laura?"\r\n\r\n"Because in this matter you have been his chosen friend,--and mine.\r\nWe have told you everything, trusting to you. We have believed in\r\nyour honour. We have thought that with you, at any rate, we were\r\nsafe." These words were very bitter to Phineas, and yet when he had\r\nwritten his letter at Loughton, he had intended to be so perfectly\r\nhonest, chivalrously honest! Now Lady Laura spoke to him and looked\r\nat him as though he had been most basely false--most untrue to that\r\nnoble friendship which had been lavished upon him by all her family.\r\nHe felt that he would become the prey of her most injurious thoughts\r\nunless he could fully explain his ideas, and he felt, also, that the\r\ncircumstances did not admit of his explaining them. He could not take\r\nup the argument on Violet\'s side, and show how unfair it would be to\r\nher that she should be debarred from the homage due to her by any man\r\nwho really loved her, because Lord Chiltern chose to think that he\r\nstill had a claim,--or at any rate a chance. And Phineas knew well\r\nof himself,--or thought that he knew well,--that he would not have\r\ninterfered had there been any chance for Lord Chiltern. Lord Chiltern\r\nhad himself told him more than once that there was no such chance.\r\nHow was he to explain all this to Lady Laura? "Mr. Finn," said Lady\r\nLaura, "I can hardly believe this of you, even when you tell it me\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"Listen to me, Lady Laura, for a moment."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, I will listen. But that you should come to me for\r\nassistance! I cannot understand it. Men sometimes become harder than\r\nstones."\r\n\r\n"I do not think that I am hard." Poor blind fool! He was still\r\nthinking only of Violet, and of the accusation made against him that\r\nhe was untrue to his friendship for Lord Chiltern. Of that other\r\naccusation which could not be expressed in open words he understood\r\nnothing,--nothing at all as yet.\r\n\r\n"Hard and false,--capable of receiving no impression beyond the\r\noutside husk of the heart."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lady Laura, do not say that. If you could only know how true I\r\nam in my affection for you all."\r\n\r\n"And how do you show it?--by coming in between Oswald and the only\r\nmeans that are open to us of reconciling him to his father;--means\r\nthat have been explained to you exactly as though you had been one of\r\nourselves. Oswald has treated you as a brother in the matter, telling\r\nyou everything, and this is the way you would repay him for his\r\nconfidence!"\r\n\r\n"Can I help it, that I have learnt to love this girl?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir,--you can help it. What if she had been Oswald\'s\r\nwife;--would you have loved her then? Do you speak of loving a woman\r\nas if it were an affair of fate, over which you have no control? I\r\ndoubt whether your passions are so strong as that. You had better put\r\naside your love for Miss Effingham. I feel assured that it will never\r\nhurt you." Then some remembrance of what had passed between him and\r\nLady Laura Standish near the falls of the Linter, when he first\r\nvisited Scotland, came across his mind. "Believe me," she said with a\r\nsmile, "this little wound in your heart will soon be cured."\r\n\r\nHe stood silent before her, looking away from her, thinking over it\r\nall. He certainly had believed himself to be violently in love with\r\nLady Laura, and yet when he had just now entered her drawing-room, he\r\nhad almost forgotten that there had been such a passage in his life.\r\nAnd he had believed that she had forgotten it,--even though she\r\nhad counselled him not to come to Loughlinter within the last nine\r\nmonths! He had been a boy then, and had not known himself;--but now\r\nhe was a man, and was proud of the intensity of his love. There came\r\nupon him some passing throb of pain from his shoulder, reminding him\r\nof the duel, and he was proud also of that. He had been willing to\r\nrisk everything,--life, prospects, and position,--sooner than abandon\r\nthe slight hope which was his of possessing Violet Effingham. And now\r\nhe was told that this wound in his heart would soon be cured, and\r\nwas told so by a woman to whom he had once sung a song of another\r\npassion. It is very hard to answer a woman in such circumstances,\r\nbecause her womanhood gives her so strong a ground of vantage! Lady\r\nLaura might venture to throw in his teeth the fickleness of his\r\nheart, but he could not in reply tell her that to change a love was\r\nbetter than to marry without love,--that to be capable of such a\r\nchange showed no such inferiority of nature as did the capacity for\r\nsuch a marriage. She could hit him with her argument; but he could\r\nonly remember his, and think how violent might be the blow he could\r\ninflict,--if it were not that she were a woman, and therefore\r\nguarded. "You will not help me then?" he said, when they had both\r\nbeen silent for a while.\r\n\r\n"Help you? How should I help you?"\r\n\r\n"I wanted no other help than this,--that I might have had an\r\nopportunity of meeting Violet here, and of getting from her some\r\nanswer."\r\n\r\n"Has the question then never been asked already?" said Lady Laura.\r\nTo this Phineas made no immediate reply. There was no reason why he\r\nshould show his whole hand to an adversary. "Why do you not go to\r\nLady Baldock\'s house?" continued Lady Laura. "You are admitted there.\r\nYou know Lady Baldock. Go and ask her to stand your friend with her\r\nniece. See what she will say to you. As far as I understand these\r\nmatters, that is the fair, honourable, open way in which gentlemen\r\nare wont to make their overtures."\r\n\r\n"I would make mine to none but to herself," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Then why have you made it to me, sir?" demanded Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"I have come to you as I would to my sister."\r\n\r\n"Your sister? Psha! I am not your sister, Mr. Finn. Nor, were I so,\r\nshould I fail to remember that I have a dearer brother to whom my\r\nfaith is pledged. Look here. Within the last three weeks Oswald has\r\nsacrificed everything to his father, because he was determined that\r\nMr. Kennedy should have the money which he thought was due to my\r\nhusband. He has enabled my father to do what he will with Saulsby.\r\nPapa will never hurt him;--I know that. Hard as papa is with him, he\r\nwill never hurt Oswald\'s future position. Papa is too proud to do\r\nthat. Violet has heard what Oswald has done; and now that he has\r\nnothing of his own to offer her for the future but his bare title,\r\nnow that he has given papa power to do what he will with the\r\nproperty, I believe that she would accept him instantly. That is her\r\ndisposition."\r\n\r\nPhineas again paused a moment before he replied. "Let him try," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"He is away,--in Brussels."\r\n\r\n"Send to him, and bid him return. I will be patient, Lady Laura. Let\r\nhim come and try, and I will bide my time. I confess that I have no\r\nright to interfere with him if there be a chance for him. If there is\r\nno chance, my right is as good as that of any other."\r\n\r\nThere was something in this which made Lady Laura feel that she\r\ncould not maintain her hostility against this man on behalf of her\r\nbrother;--and yet she could not force herself to be other than\r\nhostile to him. Her heart was sore, and it was he that had made\r\nit sore. She had lectured herself, schooling herself with mental\r\nsackcloth and ashes, rebuking herself with heaviest censures from day\r\nto day, because she had found herself to be in danger of regarding\r\nthis man with a perilous love; and she had been constant in this\r\nwork of penance till she had been able to assure herself that the\r\nsackcloth and ashes had done their work, and that the danger was\r\npast. "I like him still and love him well," she had said to herself\r\nwith something almost of triumph, "but I have ceased to think of him\r\nas one who might have been my lover." And yet she was now sick and\r\nsore, almost beside herself with the agony of the wound, because this\r\nman whom she had been able to throw aside from her heart had also\r\nbeen able so to throw her aside. And she felt herself constrained to\r\nrebuke him with what bitterest words she might use. She had felt it\r\neasy to do this at first, on her brother\'s score. She had accused him\r\nof treachery to his friendship,--both as to Oswald and as to herself.\r\nOn that she could say cutting words without subjecting herself to\r\nsuspicion even from herself. But now this power was taken away from\r\nher, and still she wished to wound him. She desired to taunt him\r\nwith his old fickleness, and yet to subject herself to no imputation.\r\n"Your right!" she said. "What gives you any right in the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Simply the right of a fair field, and no favour."\r\n\r\n"And yet you come to me for favour,--to me, because I am her friend.\r\nYou cannot win her yourself, and think I may help you! I do not\r\nbelieve in your love for her. There! If there were no other reason,\r\nand I could help you, I would not, because I think your heart is a\r\nsham heart. She is pretty, and has money--"\r\n\r\n"Lady Laura!"\r\n\r\n"She is pretty, and has money, and is the fashion. I do not wonder\r\nthat you should wish to have her. But, Mr. Finn, I believe that\r\nOswald really loves her;--and that you do not. His nature is deeper\r\nthan yours."\r\n\r\nHe understood it all now as he listened to the tone of her voice, and\r\nlooked into the lines of her face. There was written there plainly\r\nenough that spretae injuria formae of which she herself was conscious,\r\nbut only conscious. Even his eyes, blind as he had been, were\r\nopened,--and he knew that he had been a fool.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry that I came to you," he said.\r\n\r\n"It would have been better that you should not have done so," she\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n"And yet perhaps it is well that there should be no misunderstanding\r\nbetween us."\r\n\r\n"Of course I must tell my brother."\r\n\r\nHe paused but for a moment, and then he answered her with a sharp\r\nvoice, "He has been told."\r\n\r\n"And who told him?"\r\n\r\n"I did. I wrote to him the moment that I knew my own mind. I owed it\r\nto him to do so. But my letter missed him, and he only learned it the\r\nother day."\r\n\r\n"Have you seen him since?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I have seen him."\r\n\r\n"And what did he say? How did he take it? Did he bear it from you\r\nquietly?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed;" and Phineas smiled as he spoke.\r\n\r\n"Tell me, Mr. Finn; what happened? What is to be done?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing is to be done. Everything has been done. I may as well\r\ntell you all. I am sure that for the sake of me, as well as of your\r\nbrother, you will keep our secret. He required that I should either\r\ngive up my suit, or that I should,--fight him. As I could not comply\r\nwith the one request, I found myself bound to comply with the other."\r\n\r\n"And there has been a duel?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--there has been a duel. We went over to Belgium, and it was\r\nsoon settled. He wounded me here in the arm."\r\n\r\n"Suppose you had killed him, Mr. Finn?"\r\n\r\n"That, Lady Laura, would have been a misfortune so terrible that I\r\nwas bound to prevent it." Then he paused again, regretting what he\r\nhad said. "You have surprised me, Lady Laura, into an answer that I\r\nshould not have made. I may be sure,--may I not,--that my words will\r\nnot go beyond yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--you may be sure of that." This she said plaintively, with a\r\ntone of voice and demeanour of body altogether different from that\r\nwhich she lately bore. Neither of them knew what was taking place\r\nbetween them; but she was, in truth, gradually submitting herself\r\nagain to this man\'s influence. Though she rebuked him at every turn\r\nfor what he said, for what he had done, for what he proposed to do,\r\nstill she could not teach herself to despise him, or even to cease to\r\nlove him for any part of it. She knew it all now,--except that word\r\nor two which had passed between Violet and Phineas in the rides of\r\nSaulsby Park. But she suspected something even of that, feeling sure\r\nthat the only matter on which Phineas would say nothing would be\r\nthat of his own success,--if success there had been. "And so you and\r\nOswald have quarrelled, and there has been a duel. That is why you\r\nwere away?"\r\n\r\n"That is why I was away."\r\n\r\n"How wrong of you,--how very wrong! Had he been,--killed, how could\r\nyou have looked us in the face again?"\r\n\r\n"I could not have looked you in the face again."\r\n\r\n"But that is over now. And were you friends afterwards?"\r\n\r\n"No;--we did not part as friends. Having gone there to fight with\r\nhim,--most unwillingly,--I could not afterwards promise him that I\r\nwould give up Miss Effingham. You say she will accept him now. Let\r\nhim come and try." She had nothing further to say,--no other argument\r\nto use. There was the soreness at her heart still present to her,\r\nmaking her wretched, instigating her to hurt him if she knew how to\r\ndo so, in spite of her regard for him. But she felt that she was weak\r\nand powerless. She had shot her arrows at him,--all but one,--and if\r\nshe used that, its poisoned point would wound herself far more surely\r\nthan it would touch him. "The duel was very silly," he said. "You\r\nwill not speak of it."\r\n\r\n"No; certainly not."\r\n\r\n"I am glad at least that I have told you everything."\r\n\r\n"I do not know why you should be glad. I cannot help you."\r\n\r\n"And you will say nothing to Violet?"\r\n\r\n"Everything that I can say in Oswald\'s favour. I will say nothing of\r\nthe duel; but beyond that you have no right to demand my secrecy with\r\nher. Yes; you had better go, Mr. Finn, for I am hardly well. And\r\nremember this,--If you can forget this little episode about Miss\r\nEffingham, so will I forget it also; and so will Oswald. I can\r\npromise for him." Then she smiled and gave him her hand, and he went.\r\n\r\nShe rose from her chair as he left the room, and waited till she\r\nheard the sound of the great door closing behind him before she again\r\nsat down. Then, when he was gone,--when she was sure that he was no\r\nlonger there with her in the same house,--she laid her head down upon\r\nthe arm of the sofa, and burst into a flood of tears. She was no\r\nlonger angry with Phineas. There was no further longing in her heart\r\nfor revenge. She did not now desire to injure him, though she had\r\ndone so as long as he was with her. Nay,--she resolved instantly,\r\nalmost instinctively, that Lord Brentford must know nothing of all\r\nthis, lest the political prospects of the young member for Loughton\r\nshould be injured. To have rebuked him, to rebuke him again and\r\nagain, would be only fair,--would at least be womanly; but she\r\nwould protect him from all material injury as far as her power of\r\nprotection might avail. And why was she weeping now so bitterly?\r\nOf course she asked herself, as she rubbed away the tears with her\r\nhands,--Why should she weep? She was not weak enough to tell herself\r\nthat she was weeping for any injury that had been done to Oswald.\r\nShe got up suddenly from the sofa, and pushed away her hair from her\r\nface, and pushed away the tears from her cheeks, and then clenched\r\nher fists as she held them out at full length from her body, and\r\nstood, looking up with her eyes fixed upon the wall. "Ass!" she\r\nexclaimed. "Fool! Idiot! That I should not be able to crush it into\r\nnothing and have done with it! Why should he not have her? After all,\r\nhe is better than Oswald. Oh,--is that you?" The door of the room had\r\nbeen opened while she was standing thus, and her husband had entered.\r\n\r\n"Yes,--it is I. Is anything wrong?"\r\n\r\n"Very much is wrong."\r\n\r\n"What is it, Laura?"\r\n\r\n"You cannot help me."\r\n\r\n"If you are in trouble you should tell me what it is, and leave it to\r\nme to try to help you."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" she said, shaking her head.\r\n\r\n"Laura, that is uncourteous,--not to say undutiful also."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it was,--both. I beg your pardon, but I could not help\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Laura, you should help such words to me."\r\n\r\n"There are moments, Robert, when even a married woman must be\r\nherself rather than her husband\'s wife. It is so, though you cannot\r\nunderstand it."\r\n\r\n"I certainly do not understand it."\r\n\r\n"You cannot make a woman subject to you as a dog is so. You may have\r\nall the outside and as much of the inside as you can master. With a\r\ndog you may be sure of both."\r\n\r\n"I suppose this means that you have secrets in which I am not to\r\nshare."\r\n\r\n"I have troubles about my father and my brother which you cannot\r\nshare. My brother is a ruined man."\r\n\r\n"Who ruined him?"\r\n\r\n"I will not talk about it any more. I will not speak to you of him or\r\nof papa. I only want you to understand that there is a subject which\r\nmust be secret to myself, and on which I may be allowed to shed\r\ntears,--if I am so weak. I will not trouble you on a matter in which\r\nI have not your sympathy." Then she left him, standing in the middle\r\nof the room, depressed by what had occurred,--but not thinking of it\r\nas of a trouble which would do more than make him uncomfortable for\r\nthat day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nMadame Max Goesler\r\n\r\n\r\nDay after day, and clause after clause, the bill was fought in\r\ncommittee, and few men fought with more constancy on the side of the\r\nMinisters than did the member for Loughton. Troubled though he was by\r\nhis quarrel with Lord Chiltern, by his love for Violet Effingham, by\r\nthe silence of his friend Lady Laura,--for since he had told her of\r\nthe duel she had become silent to him, never writing to him, and\r\nhardly speaking to him when she met him in society,--nevertheless\r\nPhineas was not so troubled but what he could work at his vocation.\r\nNow, when he would find himself upon his legs in the House, he would\r\nwonder at the hesitation which had lately troubled him so sorely. He\r\nwould sit sometimes and speculate upon that dimness of eye, upon that\r\ntendency of things to go round, upon that obtrusive palpitation of\r\nheart, which had afflicted him so seriously for so long a time. The\r\nHouse now was no more to him than any other chamber, and the members\r\nno more than other men. He guarded himself from orations, speaking\r\nalways very shortly,--because he believed that policy and good\r\njudgment required that he should be short. But words were very easy\r\nto him, and he would feel as though he could talk for ever. And there\r\nquickly came to him a reputation for practical usefulness. He was a\r\nman with strong opinions, who could yet be submissive. And no man\r\nseemed to know how his reputation had come. He had made one good\r\nspeech after two or three failures. All who knew him, his whole\r\nparty, had been aware of his failure; and his one good speech had\r\nbeen regarded by many as no very wonderful effort. But he was a man\r\nwho was pleasant to other men,--not combative, not self-asserting\r\nbeyond the point at which self-assertion ceases to be a necessity of\r\nmanliness. Nature had been very good to him, making him comely inside\r\nand out,--and with this comeliness he had crept into popularity.\r\n\r\nThe secret of the duel was, I think, at this time, known to a great\r\nmany men and women. So Phineas perceived; but it was not, he thought,\r\nknown either to Lord Brentford or to Violet Effingham. And in this\r\nhe was right. No rumour of it had yet reached the ears of either of\r\nthese persons;--and rumour, though she flies so fast and so far, is\r\noften slow in reaching those ears which would be most interested in\r\nher tidings. Some dim report of the duel reached even Mr. Kennedy,\r\nand he asked his wife. "Who told you?" said she, sharply.\r\n\r\n"Bonteen told me that it was certainly so."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Bonteen always knows more than anybody else about everything\r\nexcept his own business."\r\n\r\n"Then it is not true?"\r\n\r\nLady Laura paused,--and then she lied. "Of course it is not true. I\r\nshould be very sorry to ask either of them, but to me it seems to be\r\nthe most improbable thing in life." Then Mr. Kennedy believed that\r\nthere had been no duel. In his wife\'s word he put absolute faith, and\r\nhe thought that she would certainly know anything that her brother\r\nhad done. As he was a man given to but little discourse, he asked no\r\nfurther questions about the duel either in the House or at the Clubs.\r\n\r\nAt first, Phineas had been greatly dismayed when men had asked\r\nhim questions tending to elicit from him some explanation of the\r\nmystery;--but by degrees he became used to it, and as the tidings\r\nwhich had got abroad did not seem to injure him, and as the\r\nquestionings were not pushed very closely, he became indifferent.\r\nThere came out another article in the _People\'s Banner_ in which Lord\r\nC----n and Mr. P----s F----n were spoken of as glaring examples of\r\nthat aristocratic snobility,--that was the expressive word coined,\r\nevidently with great delight, for the occasion,--which the rotten\r\nstate of London society in high quarters now produced. Here was\r\na young lord, infamously notorious, quarrelling with one of his\r\nboon-companions, whom he had appointed to a private seat in the\r\nHouse of Commons, fighting duels, breaking the laws, scandalising\r\nthe public,--and all this was done without punishment to the guilty!\r\nThere were old stories afloat,--so said the article--of what in a\r\nformer century had been done by Lord Mohuns and Mr. Bests; but now,\r\nin 186--, &c. &c. &c. And so the article went on. Any reader may fill\r\nin without difficulty the concluding indignation and virtuous appeal\r\nfor reform in social morals as well as Parliament. But Phineas had so\r\nfar progressed that he had almost come to like this kind of thing.\r\n\r\nCertainly I think that the duel did him no harm in society. Otherwise\r\nhe would hardly have been asked to a semi-political dinner at Lady\r\nGlencora Palliser\'s, even though he might have been invited to make\r\none of the five hundred guests who were crowded into her saloons\r\nand staircases after the dinner was over. To have been one of the\r\nfive hundred was nothing; but to be one of the sixteen was a great\r\ndeal,--was indeed so much that Phineas, not understanding as yet the\r\nadvantage of his own comeliness, was at a loss to conceive why so\r\npleasant an honour was conferred upon him. There was no man among the\r\neight men at the dinner-party not in Parliament,--and the only other\r\nexcept Phineas not attached to the Government was Mr. Palliser\'s\r\ngreat friend, John Grey, the member for Silverbridge. There were four\r\nCabinet Ministers in the room,--the Duke, Lord Cantrip, Mr. Gresham,\r\nand the owner of the mansion. There was also Barrington Erle and\r\nyoung Lord Fawn, an Under-Secretary of State. But the wit and grace\r\nof the ladies present lent more of character to the party than even\r\nthe position of the men. Lady Glencora Palliser herself was a host.\r\nThere was no woman then in London better able to talk to a dozen\r\npeople on a dozen subjects; and then, moreover, she was still in\r\nthe flush of her beauty and the bloom of her youth. Lady Laura was\r\nthere;--by what means divided from her husband Phineas could not\r\nimagine; but Lady Glencora was good at such divisions. Lady Cantrip\r\nhad been allowed to come with her lord;--but, as was well understood,\r\nLord Cantrip was not so manifestly a husband as was Mr. Kennedy.\r\nThere are men who cannot guard themselves from the assertion of\r\nmarital rights at most inappropriate moments. Now Lord Cantrip lived\r\nwith his wife most happily; yet you should pass hours with him and\r\nher together, and hardly know that they knew each other. One of the\r\nDuke\'s daughters was there,--but not the Duchess, who was known to be\r\nheavy;--and there was the beauteous Marchioness of Hartletop. Violet\r\nEffingham was in the room also,--giving Phineas a blow at the heart\r\nas he saw her smile. Might it be that he could speak a word to her on\r\nthis occasion? Mr. Grey had also brought his wife;--and then there\r\nwas Madame Max Goesler. Phineas found that it was his fortune to take\r\ndown to dinner,--not Violet Effingham, but Madame Max Goesler. And,\r\nwhen he was placed at dinner, on the other side of him there sat Lady\r\nHartletop, who addressed the few words which she spoke exclusively\r\nto Mr. Palliser. There had been in former days matters difficult of\r\narrangement between those two; but I think that those old passages\r\nhad now been forgotten by them both. Phineas was, therefore, driven\r\nto depend exclusively on Madame Max Goesler for conversation, and\r\nhe found that he was not called upon to cast his seed into barren\r\nground.\r\n\r\nUp to that moment he had never heard of Madame Max Goesler. Lady\r\nGlencora, in introducing them, had pronounced the lady\'s name so\r\nclearly that he had caught it with accuracy, but he could not surmise\r\nwhence she had come, or why she was there. She was a woman probably\r\nsomething over thirty years of age. She had thick black hair, which\r\nshe wore in curls,--unlike anybody else in the world,--in curls which\r\nhung down low beneath her face, covering, and perhaps intended to\r\ncover, a certain thinness in her cheeks which would otherwise have\r\ntaken something from the charm of her countenance. Her eyes were\r\nlarge, of a dark blue colour, and very bright,--and she used them in\r\na manner which is as yet hardly common with Englishwomen. She seemed\r\nto intend that you should know that she employed them to conquer\r\nyou, looking as a knight may have looked in olden days who entered a\r\nchamber with his sword drawn from the scabbard and in his hand. Her\r\nforehead was broad and somewhat low. Her nose was not classically\r\nbeautiful, being broader at the nostrils than beauty required, and,\r\nmoreover, not perfectly straight in its line. Her lips were thin.\r\nHer teeth, which she endeavoured to show as little as possible, were\r\nperfect in form and colour. They who criticised her severely said,\r\nhowever, that they were too large. Her chin was well formed, and\r\ndivided by a dimple which gave to her face a softness of grace which\r\nwould otherwise have been much missed. But perhaps her great beauty\r\nwas in the brilliant clearness of her dark complexion. You might\r\nalmost fancy that you could see into it so as to read the different\r\nlines beneath the skin. She was somewhat tall, though by no means\r\ntall to a fault, and was so thin as to be almost meagre in her\r\nproportions. She always wore her dress close up to her neck, and\r\nnever showed the bareness of her arms. Though she was the only woman\r\nso clad now present in the room, this singularity did not specially\r\nstrike one, because in other respects her apparel was so rich and\r\nquaint as to make inattention to it impossible. The observer who did\r\nnot observe very closely would perceive that Madame Max Goesler\'s\r\ndress was unlike the dress of other women, but seeing that it was\r\nunlike in make, unlike in colour, and unlike in material, the\r\nordinary observer would not see also that it was unlike in form for\r\nany other purpose than that of maintaining its general peculiarity\r\nof character. In colour she was abundant, and yet the fabric of\r\nher garment was always black. My pen may not dare to describe the\r\ntraceries of yellow and ruby silk which went in and out through\r\nthe black lace, across her bosom, and round her neck, and over her\r\nshoulders, and along her arms, and down to the very ground at her\r\nfeet, robbing the black stuff of all its sombre solemnity, and\r\nproducing a brightness in which there was nothing gaudy. She wore\r\nno vestige of crinoline, and hardly anything that could be called a\r\ntrain. And the lace sleeves of her dress, with their bright traceries\r\nof silk, were fitted close to her arms; and round her neck she wore\r\nthe smallest possible collar of lace, above which there was a short\r\nchain of Roman gold with a ruby pendant. And she had rubies in her\r\nears, and a ruby brooch, and rubies in the bracelets on her arms.\r\nSuch, as regarded the outward woman, was Madame Max Goesler; and\r\nPhineas, as he took his place by her side, thought that fortune for\r\nthe nonce had done well with him,--only that he should have liked it\r\nso much better could he have been seated next to Violet Effingham!\r\n\r\nI have said that in the matter of conversation his morsel of seed was\r\nnot thrown into barren ground. I do not know that he can truly be\r\nsaid to have produced even a morsel. The subjects were all mooted\r\nby the lady, and so great was her fertility in discoursing that all\r\nconversational grasses seemed to grow with her spontaneously. "Mr.\r\nFinn," she said, "what would I not give to be a member of the British\r\nParliament at such a moment as this!"\r\n\r\n"Why at such a moment as this particularly?"\r\n\r\n"Because there is something to be done, which, let me tell you,\r\nsenator though you are, is not always the case with you."\r\n\r\n"My experience is short, but it sometimes seems to me that there is\r\ntoo much to be done."\r\n\r\n"Too much of nothingness, Mr. Finn. Is not that the case? But now\r\nthere is a real fight in the lists. The one great drawback to the\r\nlife of women is that they cannot act in politics."\r\n\r\n"And which side would you take?"\r\n\r\n"What, here in England?" said Madame Max Goesler,--from which\r\nexpression, and from one or two others of a similar nature, Phineas\r\nwas led into a doubt whether the lady were a countrywoman of his\r\nor not. "Indeed, it is hard to say. Politically I should want to\r\nout-Turnbull Mr. Turnbull, to vote for everything that could be\r\nvoted for,--ballot, manhood suffrage, womanhood suffrage, unlimited\r\nright of striking, tenant right, education of everybody, annual\r\nparliaments, and the abolition of at least the bench of bishops."\r\n\r\n"That is a strong programme," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"It is strong, Mr. Finn, but that\'s what I should like. I think,\r\nhowever, that I should be tempted to feel a dastard security in the\r\nconviction that I might advocate my views without any danger of\r\nseeing them carried out. For, to tell you the truth, I don\'t at all\r\nwant to put down ladies and gentlemen."\r\n\r\n"You think that they would go with the bench of bishops?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want anything to go,--that is, as far as real life is\r\nconcerned. There\'s that dear good Bishop of Abingdon is the best\r\nfriend I have in the world,--and as for the Bishop of Dorchester,\r\nI\'d walk from here to there to hear him preach. And I\'d sooner hem\r\naprons for them all myself than that they should want those pretty\r\ndecorations. But then, Mr. Finn, there is such a difference between\r\nlife and theory;--is there not?"\r\n\r\n"And it is so comfortable to have theories that one is not bound to\r\ncarry out," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it? Mr. Palliser, do you live up to your political theories?"\r\nAt this moment Mr. Palliser was sitting perfectly silent between Lady\r\nHartletop and the Duke\'s daughter, and he gave a little spring in his\r\nchair as this sudden address was made to him. "Your House of Commons\r\ntheories, I mean, Mr. Palliser. Mr. Finn is saying that it is\r\nvery well to have far advanced ideas,--it does not matter how\r\nfar advanced,--because one is never called upon to act upon them\r\npractically."\r\n\r\n"That is a dangerous doctrine, I think," said Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\n"But pleasant,--so at least Mr. Finn says."\r\n\r\n"It is at least very common," said Phineas, not caring to protect\r\nhimself by a contradiction.\r\n\r\n"For myself," said Mr. Palliser gravely, "I think I may say that I\r\nalways am really anxious to carry into practice all those doctrines\r\nof policy which I advocate in theory."\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation Lady Hartletop sat as though no word of it\r\nreached her ears. She did not understand Madame Max Goesler, and by\r\nno means loved her. Mr. Palliser, when he had made his little speech,\r\nturned to the Duke\'s daughter and asked some question about the\r\nconservatories at Longroyston.\r\n\r\n"I have called forth a word of wisdom," said Madame Max Goesler,\r\nalmost in a whisper.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Phineas, "and taught a Cabinet Minister to believe that\r\nI am a most unsound politician. You may have ruined my prospects for\r\nlife, Madame Max Goesler."\r\n\r\n"Let me hope not. As far as I can understand the way of things in\r\nyour Government, the aspirants to office succeed chiefly by making\r\nthemselves uncommonly unpleasant to those who are in power. If a man\r\ncan hit hard enough he is sure to be taken into the elysium of the\r\nTreasury bench,--not that he may hit others, but that he may cease to\r\nhit those who are there. I don\'t think men are chosen because they\r\nare useful."\r\n\r\n"You are very severe upon us all."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, as far as I can see, one man is as useful as another. But\r\nto put aside joking,--they tell me that you are sure to become a\r\nminister."\r\n\r\nPhineas felt that he blushed. Could it be that people said of him\r\nbehind his back that he was a man likely to rise high in political\r\nposition? "Your informants are very kind," he replied awkwardly,\r\n"but I do not know who they are. I shall never get up in the way you\r\ndescribe,--that is, by abusing the men I support."\r\n\r\nAfter that Madame Max Goesler turned round to Mr. Grey, who was\r\nsitting on the other side of her, and Phineas was left for a moment\r\nin silence. He tried to say a word to Lady Hartletop, but Lady\r\nHartletop only bowed her head gracefully in recognition of the truth\r\nof the statement he made. So he applied himself for a while to his\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\n"What do you think of Miss Effingham?" said Madame Max Goesler, again\r\naddressing him suddenly.\r\n\r\n"What do I think about her?"\r\n\r\n"You know her, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I know her. She is closely connected with the Kennedys, who\r\nare friends of mine."\r\n\r\n"So I have heard. They tell me that scores of men are raving about\r\nher. Are you one of them?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;--I don\'t mind being one of sundry scores. There is nothing\r\nparticular in owning to that."\r\n\r\n"But you admire her?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I do," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Ah, I see you are joking. I do amazingly. They say women never do\r\nadmire women, but I most sincerely do admire Miss Effingham."\r\n\r\n"Is she a friend of yours?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no;--I must not dare to say so much as that. I was with her last\r\nwinter for a week at Matching, and of course I meet her about at\r\npeople\'s houses. She seems to me to be the most independent girl I\r\never knew in my life. I do believe that nothing would make her marry\r\na man unless she loved him and honoured him, and I think it is so\r\nvery seldom that you can say that of a girl."\r\n\r\n"I believe so also," said Phineas. Then he paused a moment before he\r\ncontinued to speak. "I cannot say that I know Miss Effingham very\r\nintimately, but from what I have seen of her, I should think it very\r\nprobable that she may not marry at all."\r\n\r\n"Very probably," said Madame Max Goesler, who then again turned away\r\nto Mr. Grey.\r\n\r\nTen minutes after this, when the moment was just at hand in which the\r\nladies were to retreat, Madame Max Goesler again addressed Phineas,\r\nlooking very full into his face as she did so. "I wonder whether the\r\ntime will ever come, Mr. Finn, in which you will give me an account\r\nof that day\'s journey to Blankenberg?"\r\n\r\n"To Blankenberg!"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--to Blankenberg. I am not asking for it now. But I shall look\r\nfor it some day." Then Lady Glencora rose from her seat, and Madame\r\nMax Goesler went out with the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nLord Fawn\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat had Madame Max Goesler to do with his journey to Blankenberg?\r\nthought Phineas, as he sat for a while in silence between Mr.\r\nPalliser and Mr. Grey; and why should she, who was a perfect\r\nstranger to him, have dared to ask him such a question? But as the\r\nconversation round the table, after the ladies had gone, soon drifted\r\ninto politics and became general, Phineas, for a while, forgot Madame\r\nMax Goesler and the Blankenberg journey, and listened to the eager\r\nwords of Cabinet Ministers, now and again uttering a word of his own,\r\nand showing that he, too, was as eager as others. But the session\r\nin Mr. Palliser\'s dining-room was not long, and Phineas soon found\r\nhimself making his way amidst a throng of coming guests into the\r\nrooms above. His object was to meet Violet Effingham, but, failing\r\nthat, he would not be unwilling to say a few more words to Madame Max\r\nGoesler.\r\n\r\nHe first encountered Lady Laura, to whom he had not spoken as yet,\r\nand, finding himself standing close to her for a while, he asked her\r\nafter his late neighbour. "Do tell me one thing, Lady Laura;--who is\r\nMadame Max Goesler, and why have I never met her before?"\r\n\r\n"That will be two things, Mr. Finn; but I will answer both questions\r\nas well as I can. You have not met her before, because she was in\r\nGermany last spring and summer, and in the year before that you were\r\nnot about so much as you have been since. Still you must have seen\r\nher, I think. She is the widow of an Austrian banker, and has lived\r\nthe greater part of her life at Vienna. She is very rich, and has a\r\nsmall house in Park Lane, where she receives people so exclusively\r\nthat it has come to be thought an honour to be invited by Madame Max\r\nGoesler. Her enemies say that her father was a German Jew, living in\r\nEngland, in the employment of the Viennese bankers, and they say also\r\nthat she has been married a second time to an Austrian Count, to whom\r\nshe allows ever so much a year to stay away from her. But of all\r\nthis, nobody, I fancy, knows anything. What they do know is that\r\nMadame Max Goesler spends seven or eight thousand a year, and that\r\nshe will give no man an opportunity of even asking her to marry him.\r\nPeople used to be shy of her, but she goes almost everywhere now."\r\n\r\n"She has not been at Portman Square?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no; but then Lady Glencora is so much more advanced than we are!\r\nAfter all, we are but humdrum people, as the world goes now."\r\n\r\nThen Phineas began to roam about the rooms, striving to find an\r\nopportunity of engrossing five minutes of Miss Effingham\'s attention.\r\nDuring the time that Lady Laura was giving him the history of Madame\r\nMax Goesler his eyes had wandered round, and he had perceived that\r\nViolet was standing in the further corner of a large lobby on to\r\nwhich the stairs opened,--so situated, indeed, that she could hardly\r\nescape, because of the increasing crowd, but on that very account\r\nalmost impossible to be reached. He could see, also, that she was\r\ntalking to Lord Fawn, an unmarried peer of something over thirty\r\nyears of age, with an unrivalled pair of whiskers, a small estate,\r\nand a rising political reputation. Lord Fawn had been talking to\r\nViolet through the whole dinner, and Phineas was beginning to think\r\nthat he should like to make another journey to Blankenberg, with the\r\nobject of meeting his lordship on the sands. When Lady Laura had done\r\nspeaking, his eyes were turned through a large open doorway towards\r\nthe spot on which his idol was standing. "It is of no use, my\r\nfriend," she said, touching his arm. "I wish I could make you know\r\nthat it is of no use, because then I think you would be happier." To\r\nthis Phineas made no answer, but went and roamed about the rooms. Why\r\nshould it be of no use? Would Violet Effingham marry any man merely\r\nbecause he was a lord?\r\n\r\nSome half-hour after this he had succeeded in making his way up to\r\nthe place in which Violet was still standing, with Lord Fawn beside\r\nher. "I have been making such a struggle to get to you," he said.\r\n\r\n"And now you are here, you will have to stay, for it is impossible to\r\nget out," she answered. "Lord Fawn has made the attempt half-a-dozen\r\ntimes, but has failed grievously."\r\n\r\n"I have been quite contented," said Lord Fawn;--"more than\r\ncontented."\r\n\r\nPhineas felt that he ought to give some special reason to Miss\r\nEffingham to account for his efforts to reach her, but yet he had\r\nnothing special to say. Had Lord Fawn not been there, he would\r\nimmediately have told her that he was waiting for an answer to the\r\nquestion he had asked her in Saulsby Park, but he could hardly do\r\nthis in presence of the noble Under-Secretary of State. She received\r\nhim with her pleasant genial smile, looking exactly as she had looked\r\nwhen he had parted from her on the morning after their ride. She did\r\nnot show any sign of anger, or even of indifference at his approach.\r\nBut still it was almost necessary that he should account for his\r\nsearch of her. "I have so longed to hear from you how you got on at\r\nLoughlinter," he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes,--yes; and I will tell you something of it some day, perhaps.\r\nWhy do you not come to Lady Baldock\'s?"\r\n\r\n"I did not even know that Lady Baldock was in town."\r\n\r\n"You ought to have known. Of course she is in town. Where did you\r\nsuppose I was living? Lord Fawn was there yesterday, and can tell you\r\nthat my aunt is quite blooming."\r\n\r\n"Lady Baldock is blooming," said Lord Fawn; "certainly\r\nblooming;--that is, if evergreens may be said to bloom."\r\n\r\n"Evergreens do bloom, as well as spring plants, Lord Fawn. You come\r\nand see her, Mr. Finn;--only you must bring a little money with you\r\nfor the Female Protestant Unmarried Women\'s Emigration Society. That\r\nis my aunt\'s present hobby, as Lord Fawn knows to his cost."\r\n\r\n"I wish I may never spend half-a-sovereign worse."\r\n\r\n"But it is a perilous affair for me, as my aunt wants me to go out\r\nas a sort of leading Protestant unmarried female emigrant pioneer\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean that," said Lord Fawn, with much anxiety.\r\n\r\n"Of course you\'ll go," said Phineas. "I should, if I were you."\r\n\r\n"I am in doubt," said Violet.\r\n\r\n"It is such a grand prospect," said he. "Such an opening in life. So\r\nmuch excitement, you know; and such a useful career."\r\n\r\n"As if there were not plenty of opening here for Miss Effingham,"\r\nsaid Lord Fawn, "and plenty of excitement."\r\n\r\n"Do you think there is?" said Violet. "You are much more civil than\r\nMr. Finn, I must say." Then Phineas began to hope that he need not be\r\nafraid of Lord Fawn. "What a happy man you were at dinner!" continued\r\nViolet, addressing herself to Phineas.\r\n\r\n"I thought Lord Fawn was the happy man."\r\n\r\n"You had Madame Max Goesler all to yourself for nearly two hours, and\r\nI suppose there was not a creature in the room who did not envy you.\r\nI don\'t doubt that ever so much interest was made with Lady Glencora\r\nas to taking Madame Max down to dinner. Lord Fawn, I know,\r\nintrigued."\r\n\r\n"Miss Effingham, really I must--contradict you."\r\n\r\n"And Barrington Erle begged for it as a particular favour. The Duke,\r\nwith a sigh, owned that it was impossible, because of his cumbrous\r\nrank; and Mr. Gresham, when it was offered to him, declared that\r\nhe was fatigued with the business of the House, and not up to the\r\noccasion. How much did she say to you; and what did she talk about?"\r\n\r\n"The ballot chiefly,--that, and manhood suffrage."\r\n\r\n"Ah! she said something more than that, I am sure. Madame Max Goesler\r\nnever lets any man go without entrancing him. If you have anything\r\nnear your heart, Mr. Finn, Madame Max Goesler touched it, I am sure."\r\nNow Phineas had two things near his heart,--political promotion and\r\nViolet Effingham,--and Madame Max Goesler had managed to touch them\r\nboth. She had asked him respecting his journey to Blankenberg, and\r\nhad touched him very nearly in reference to Miss Effingham. "You know\r\nMadame Max Goesler, of course?" said Violet to Lord Fawn.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I know the lady;--that is, as well as other people do. No\r\none, I take it, knows much of her; and it seems to me that the world\r\nis becoming tired of her. A mystery is good for nothing if it remains\r\nalways a mystery."\r\n\r\n"And it is good for nothing at all when it is found out," said\r\nViolet.\r\n\r\n"And therefore it is that Madame Max Goesler is a bore," said Lord\r\nFawn.\r\n\r\n"You did not find her a bore?" said Violet. Then Phineas, choosing\r\nto oppose Lord Fawn as well as he could on that matter, as on every\r\nother, declared that he had found Madame Max Goesler most delightful.\r\n"And beautiful,--is she not?" said Violet.\r\n\r\n"Beautiful!" exclaimed Lord Fawn.\r\n\r\n"I think her very beautiful," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"So do I," said Violet. "And she is a dear ally of mine. We were a\r\nweek together last winter, and swore an undying friendship. She told\r\nme ever so much about Mr. Goesler."\r\n\r\n"But she told you nothing of her second husband?" said Lord Fawn.\r\n\r\n"Now that you have run into scandal, I shall have done," said Violet.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour after this, when Phineas was preparing to fight his way\r\nout of the house, he was again close to Madame Max Goesler. He had\r\nnot found a single moment in which to ask Violet for an answer to his\r\nold question, and was retiring from the field discomfited, but not\r\ndispirited. Lord Fawn, he thought, was not a serious obstacle in his\r\nway. Lady Laura had told him that there was no hope for him; but\r\nthen Lady Laura\'s mind on that subject was, he thought, prejudiced.\r\nViolet Effingham certainly knew what were his wishes, and knowing\r\nthem, smiled on him and was gracious to him. Would she do so if his\r\npretensions were thoroughly objectionable to her?\r\n\r\n"I saw that you were successful this evening," said Madame Max\r\nGoesler to him.\r\n\r\n"I was not aware of any success."\r\n\r\n"I call it great success to be able to make your way where you will\r\nthrough such a crowd as there is here. You seem to me to be so stout\r\na cavalier that I shall ask you to find my servant, and bid him\r\nget my carriage. Will you mind?" Phineas, of course, declared that\r\nhe would be delighted. "He is a German, and not in livery. But if\r\nsomebody will call out, he will hear. He is very sharp, and much more\r\nattentive than your English footmen. An Englishman hardly ever makes\r\na good servant."\r\n\r\n"Is that a compliment to us Britons?"\r\n\r\n"No, certainly not. If a man is a servant, he should be clever enough\r\nto be a good one." Phineas had now given the order for the carriage,\r\nand, having returned, was standing with Madame Max Goesler in the\r\ncloak-room. "After all, we are surely the most awkward people in\r\nthe world," she said. "You know Lord Fawn, who was talking to Miss\r\nEffingham just now. You should have heard him trying to pay me a\r\ncompliment before dinner. It was like a donkey walking a minuet, and\r\nyet they say he is a clever man and can make speeches." Could it be\r\npossible that Madame Max Goesler\'s ears were so sharp that she had\r\nheard the things which Lord Fawn had said of her?\r\n\r\n"He is a well-informed man," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"For a lord, you mean," said Madame Max Goesler. "But he is an oaf,\r\nis he not? And yet they say he is to marry that girl."\r\n\r\n"I do not think he will," said Phineas, stoutly.\r\n\r\n"I hope not, with all my heart; and I hope that somebody else\r\nmay,--unless somebody else should change his mind. Thank you; I am so\r\nmuch obliged to you. Mind you come and call on me,--193, Park Lane. I\r\ndare say you know the little cottage." Then he put Madame Max Goesler\r\ninto her carriage, and walked away to his club.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nLady Baldock Does Not Send a Card to Phineas Finn\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Baldock\'s house in Berkeley Square was very stately,--a large\r\nhouse with five front windows in a row, and a big door, and a huge\r\nsquare hall, and a fat porter in a round-topped chair;--but it was\r\ndingy and dull, and could not have been painted for the last ten\r\nyears, or furnished for the last twenty. Nevertheless, Lady Baldock\r\nhad "evenings," and people went to them,--though not such a crowd of\r\npeople as would go to the evenings of Lady Glencora. Now Mr. Phineas\r\nFinn had not been asked to the evenings of Lady Baldock for the\r\npresent season, and the reason was after this wise.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Finn," Lady Baldock had said to her daughter, who, early in\r\nthe spring, was preparing the cards. "You may send one to Mr. Finn,\r\ncertainly."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that he is very nice," said Augusta Boreham, whose eyes\r\nat Saulsby had been sharper perhaps than her mother\'s, and who had\r\nher suspicions.\r\n\r\nBut Lady Baldock did not like interference from her daughter. "Mr.\r\nFinn, certainly," she continued. "They tell me that he is a very\r\nrising young man, and he sits for Lord Brentford\'s borough. Of course\r\nhe is a Radical, but we cannot help that. All the rising young men\r\nare Radicals now. I thought him very civil at Saulsby."\r\n\r\n"But, mamma--"\r\n\r\n"Well!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think that he is a little free with Violet?"\r\n\r\n"What on earth do you mean, Augusta?"\r\n\r\n"Have you not fancied that he is--fond of her?"\r\n\r\n"Good gracious, no!"\r\n\r\n"I think he is. And I have sometimes fancied that she is fond of him,\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe a word of it, Augusta,--not a word. I should have\r\nseen it if it was so. I am very sharp in seeing such things. They\r\nnever escape me. Even Violet would not be such a fool as that. Send\r\nhim a card, and if he comes I shall soon see." Miss Boreham quite\r\nunderstood her mother, though she could never master her,--and the\r\ncard was prepared. Miss Boreham could never master her mother by her\r\nown efforts; but it was, I think, by a little intrigue on her part\r\nthat Lady Baldock was mastered, and, indeed, altogether cowed, in\r\nreference to our hero, and that this victory was gained on that very\r\nafternoon in time to prevent the sending of the card.\r\n\r\nWhen the mother and daughter were at tea, before dinner, Lord Baldock\r\ncame into the room, and, after having been patted and petted and\r\npraised by his mother, he took up all the cards out of a china bowl\r\nand ran his eyes over them. "Lord Fawn!" he said, "the greatest ass\r\nin all London! Lady Hartletop! you know she won\'t come." "I don\'t\r\nsee why she shouldn\'t come," said Lady Baldock;--"a mere country\r\nclergyman\'s daughter!" "Julius Caesar Conway;--a great friend of mine,\r\nand therefore he always blackballs my other friends at the club. Lord\r\nChiltern; I thought you were at daggers drawn with Chiltern." "They\r\nsay he is going to be reconciled to his father, Gustavus, and I do it\r\nfor Lord Brentford\'s sake. And he won\'t come, so it does not signify.\r\nAnd I do believe that Violet has really refused him." "You are quite\r\nright about his not coming," said Lord Baldock, continuing to read\r\nthe cards; "Chiltern certainly won\'t come. Count Sparrowsky;--I\r\nwonder what you know about Sparrowsky that you should ask him here."\r\n"He is asked about, Gustavus; he is indeed," pleaded Lady Baldock. "I\r\nbelieve that Sparrowsky is a penniless adventurer. Mr. Monk; well,\r\nhe is a Cabinet Minister. Sir Gregory Greeswing; you mix your people\r\nnicely at any rate. Sir Gregory Greeswing is the most old-fashioned\r\nTory in England." "Of course we are not political, Gustavus."\r\n"Phineas Finn. They come alternately,--one and one.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Finn is asked everywhere, Gustavus."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t doubt it. They say he is a very good sort of fellow. They\r\nsay also that Violet has found that out as well as other people."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, Gustavus?"\r\n\r\n"I mean that everybody is saying that this Phineas Finn is going to\r\nset himself up in the world by marrying your niece. He is quite right\r\nto try it on, if he has a chance."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he would be right at all," said Lady Baldock, with\r\nmuch energy. "I think he would be wrong,--shamefully wrong. They say\r\nhe is the son of an Irish doctor, and that he hasn\'t a shilling in\r\nthe world."\r\n\r\n"That is just why he would be right. What is such a man to do, but to\r\nmarry money? He\'s a deuced good-looking fellow, too, and will be sure\r\nto do it."\r\n\r\n"He should work for his money in the city, then, or somewhere there.\r\nBut I don\'t believe it, Gustavus; I don\'t, indeed."\r\n\r\n"Very well. I only tell you what I hear. The fact is that he and\r\nChiltern have already quarrelled about her. If I were to tell you\r\nthat they have been over to Holland together and fought a duel about\r\nher, you wouldn\'t believe that."\r\n\r\n"Fought a duel about Violet! People don\'t fight duels now, and I\r\nshould not believe it."\r\n\r\n"Very well. Then send your card to Mr. Finn." And, so saying, Lord\r\nBaldock left the room.\r\n\r\nLady Baldock sat in silence for some time toasting her toes at the\r\nfire, and Augusta Boreham sat by, waiting for orders. She felt pretty\r\nnearly sure that new orders would be given if she did not herself\r\ninterfere. "You had better put by that card for the present, my\r\ndear," said Lady Baldock at last. "I will make inquiries. I don\'t\r\nbelieve a word of what Gustavus has said. I don\'t think that even\r\nViolet is such a fool as that. But if rash and ill-natured people\r\nhave spoken of it, it may be as well to be careful."\r\n\r\n"It is always well to be careful;--is it not, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"Not but what I think it very improper that these things should be\r\nsaid about a young woman; and as for the story of the duel, I don\'t\r\nbelieve a word of it. It is absurd. I dare say that Gustavus invented\r\nit at the moment, just to amuse himself."\r\n\r\nThe card of course was not sent, and Lady Baldock at any rate put so\r\nmuch faith in her son\'s story as to make her feel it to be her duty\r\nto interrogate her niece on the subject. Lady Baldock at this period\r\nof her life was certainly not free from fear of Violet Effingham.\r\nIn the numerous encounters which took place between them, the aunt\r\nseldom gained that amount of victory which would have completely\r\nsatisfied her spirit. She longed to be dominant over her niece as she\r\nwas dominant over her daughter; and when she found that she missed\r\nsuch supremacy, she longed to tell Violet to depart from out her\r\nborders, and be no longer niece of hers. But had she ever done so,\r\nViolet would have gone at the instant, and then terrible things would\r\nhave followed. There is a satisfaction in turning out of doors a\r\nnephew or niece who is pecuniarily dependent, but when the youthful\r\nrelative is richly endowed, the satisfaction is much diminished. It\r\nis the duty of a guardian, no doubt, to look after the ward; but if\r\nthis cannot be done, the ward\'s money should at least be held with as\r\nclose a fist as possible. But Lady Baldock, though she knew that she\r\nwould be sorely wounded, poked about on her old body with the sharp\r\nlances of disobedience, and struck with the cruel swords of satire,\r\nif she took upon herself to scold or even to question Violet,\r\nnevertheless would not abandon the pleasure of lecturing and\r\nteaching. "It is my duty," she would say to herself, "and though it\r\nbe taken in a bad spirit, I will always perform my duty." So she\r\nperformed her duty, and asked Violet Effingham some few questions\r\nrespecting Phineas Finn. "My dear," she said, "do you remember\r\nmeeting a Mr. Finn at Saulsby?"\r\n\r\n"A Mr. Finn, aunt! Why, he is a particular friend of mine. Of course\r\nI do, and he was at Saulsby. I have met him there more than once.\r\nDon\'t you remember that we were riding about together?"\r\n\r\n"I remember that he was there, certainly; but I did not know that he\r\nwas a special--friend."\r\n\r\n"Most especial, aunt. A 1, I may say;--among young men, I mean."\r\n\r\nLady Baldock was certainly the most indiscreet of old women in such a\r\nmatter as this, and Violet the most provoking of young ladies. Lady\r\nBaldock, believing that there was something to fear,--as, indeed,\r\nthere was, much to fear,--should have been content to destroy the\r\ncard, and to keep the young lady away from the young gentleman,\r\nif such keeping away was possible to her. But Miss Effingham was\r\ncertainly very wrong to speak of any young man as being A 1. Fond as\r\nI am of Miss Effingham, I cannot justify her, and must acknowledge\r\nthat she used the most offensive phrase she could find, on purpose to\r\nannoy her aunt.\r\n\r\n"Violet," said Lady Baldock, bridling up, "I never heard such a word\r\nbefore from the lips of a young lady."\r\n\r\n"Not as A 1? I thought it simply meant very good."\r\n\r\n"A 1 is a nobleman," said Lady Baldock.\r\n\r\n"No, aunt;--A 1 is a ship,--a ship that is very good," said Violet.\r\n\r\n"And do you mean to say that Mr. Finn is,--is,--is,--very good?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed. You ask Lord Brentford, and Mr. Kennedy. You know he\r\nsaved poor Mr. Kennedy from being throttled in the streets."\r\n\r\n"That has nothing to do with it. A policeman might have done that."\r\n\r\n"Then he would have been A 1 of policemen,--though A 1 does not mean\r\na policeman."\r\n\r\n"He would have done his duty, and so perhaps did Mr. Finn."\r\n\r\n"Of course he did, aunt. It couldn\'t have been his duty to stand\r\nby and see Mr. Kennedy throttled. And he nearly killed one of the\r\nmen, and took the other prisoner with his own hands. And he made a\r\nbeautiful speech the other day. I read every word of it. I am so glad\r\nhe\'s a Liberal. I do like young men to be Liberals." Now Lord Baldock\r\nwas a Tory, as had been all the Lord Baldocks,--since the first who\r\nhad been bought over from the Whigs in the time of George III at the\r\ncost of a barony.\r\n\r\n"You have nothing to do with politics, Violet."\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t I have something to do with politics, aunt?"\r\n\r\n"And I must tell you that your name is being very unpleasantly\r\nmentioned in connection with that of this young man because of your\r\nindiscretion."\r\n\r\n"What indiscretion?" Violet, as she made her demand for a more direct\r\naccusation, stood quite upright before her aunt, looking the old\r\nwoman full in the face,--almost with her arms akimbo.\r\n\r\n"Calling him A 1, Violet."\r\n\r\n"People have been talking about me and Mr. Finn, because I just now,\r\nat this very moment, called him A 1 to you! If you want to scold me\r\nabout anything, aunt, do find out something less ridiculous than\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"It was most improper language,--and if you used it to me, I am sure\r\nyou would to others."\r\n\r\n"To what others?"\r\n\r\n"To Mr. Finn,--and those sort of people."\r\n\r\n"Call Mr. Finn A 1 to his face! Well,--upon my honour I don\'t know\r\nwhy I should not. Lord Chiltern says he rides beautifully, and if we\r\nwere talking about riding I might do so."\r\n\r\n"You have no business to talk to Lord Chiltern about Mr. Finn at\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"Have I not? I thought that perhaps the one sin might palliate\r\nthe other. You know, aunt, no young lady, let her be ever so\r\nill-disposed, can marry two objectionable young men,--at the same\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"I said nothing about your marrying Mr. Finn."\r\n\r\n"Then, aunt, what did you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I meant that you should not allow yourself to be talked of with an\r\nadventurer, a young man without a shilling, a person who has come\r\nfrom nobody knows where in the bogs of Ireland."\r\n\r\n"But you used to ask him here."\r\n\r\n"Yes,--as long as he knew his place. But I shall not do so again. And\r\nI must beg you to be circumspect."\r\n\r\n"My dear aunt, we may as well understand each other. I will not be\r\ncircumspect, as you call it. And if Mr. Finn asked me to marry him\r\nto-morrow, and if I liked him well enough, I would take him,--even\r\nthough he had been dug right out of a bog. Not only because I liked\r\nhim,--mind! If I were unfortunate enough to like a man who was\r\nnothing, I would refuse him in spite of my liking,--because he was\r\nnothing. But this young man is not nothing. Mr. Finn is a fine\r\nfellow, and if there were no other reason to prevent my marrying him\r\nthan his being the son of a doctor, and coming out of the bogs, that\r\nwould not do so. Now I have made a clean breast to you as regards\r\nMr. Finn; and if you do not like what I\'ve said, aunt, you must\r\nacknowledge that you have brought it on yourself."\r\n\r\nLady Baldock was left for a time speechless. But no card was sent to\r\nPhineas Finn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\nPromotion\r\n\r\n\r\nPhineas got no card from Lady Baldock, but one morning he received\r\na note from Lord Brentford which was of more importance to him than\r\nany card could have been. At this time, bit by bit, the Reform\r\nBill of the day had nearly made its way through the committee, but\r\nhad been so mutilated as to be almost impossible of recognition\r\nby its progenitors. And there was still a clause or two as to\r\nthe rearrangement of seats, respecting which it was known that\r\nthere would be a combat,--probably combats,--carried on after the\r\ninternecine fashion. There was a certain clipping of counties to be\r\ndone, as to which it was said that Mr. Daubeny had declared that\r\nhe would not yield till he was made to do so by the brute force of\r\nmajorities;--and there was another clause for the drafting of certain\r\nsuperfluous members from little boroughs, and bestowing them on\r\npopulous towns at which they were much wanted, respecting which\r\nMr. Turnbull had proclaimed that the clause as it now stood was a\r\nfaineant clause, capable of doing, and intended to do, no good in the\r\nproper direction; a clause put into the bill to gull ignorant folk\r\nwho had not eyes enough to recognise the fact that it was faineant; a\r\nmake-believe clause,--so said Mr. Turnbull,--to be detested on that\r\naccount by every true reformer worse than the old Philistine bonds\r\nand Tory figments of representation, as to which there was at least\r\nno hypocritical pretence of popular fitness. Mr. Turnbull had been\r\nvery loud and very angry,--had talked much of demonstrations among\r\nthe people, and had almost threatened the House. The House in its\r\npresent mood did not fear any demonstrations,--but it did fear that\r\nMr. Turnbull might help Mr. Daubeny, and that Mr. Daubeny might help\r\nMr. Turnbull. It was now May,--the middle of May,--and ministers, who\r\nhad been at work on their Reform Bill ever since the beginning of the\r\nsession, were becoming weary of it. And then, should these odious\r\nclauses escape the threatened Turnbull-Daubeny alliance,--then there\r\nwas the House of Lords! "What a pity we can\'t pass our bills at the\r\nTreasury, and have done with them!" said Laurence Fitzgibbon. "Yes,\r\nindeed," replied Mr. Ratler. "For myself, I was never so tired of a\r\nsession in my life. I wouldn\'t go through it again to be made,--no,\r\nnot to be made Chancellor of the Exchequer."\r\n\r\nLord Brentford\'s note to Phineas Finn was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   House of Lords, 16th May, 186--.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR MR. FINN,\r\n\r\n   You are no doubt aware that Lord Bosanquet\'s death has\r\n   taken Mr. Mottram into the Upper House, and that as\r\n   he was Under-Secretary for the Colonies, and as the\r\n   Under-Secretary must be in the Lower House, the vacancy\r\n   must be filled up.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heart of Phineas Finn at this moment was almost in his mouth. Not\r\nonly to be selected for political employment, but to be selected at\r\nonce for an office so singularly desirable! Under-Secretaries, he\r\nfancied, were paid two thousand a year. What would Mr. Low say now?\r\nBut his great triumph soon received a check. "Mr. Mildmay has spoken\r\nto me on the subject," continued the letter, "and informs me that\r\nhe has offered the place at the colonies to his old supporter, Mr.\r\nLaurence Fitzgibbon." Laurence Fitzgibbon!\r\n\r\n\r\n   I am inclined to think that he could not have done better,\r\n   as Mr. Fitzgibbon has shown great zeal for his party. This\r\n   will vacate the Irish seat at the Treasury Board, and I am\r\n   commissioned by Mr. Mildmay to offer it to you. Perhaps\r\n   you will do me the pleasure of calling on me to-morrow\r\n   between the hours of eleven and twelve.\r\n\r\n   Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\n   BRENTFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhineas was himself surprised to find that his first feeling on\r\nreading this letter was one of dissatisfaction. Here were his golden\r\nhopes about to be realised,--hopes as to the realisation of which\r\nhe had been quite despondent twelve months ago,--and yet he was\r\nuncomfortable because he was to be postponed to Laurence Fitzgibbon.\r\nHad the new Under-Secretary been a man whom he had not known, whom he\r\nhad not learned to look down upon as inferior to himself, he would\r\nnot have minded it,--would have been full of joy at the promotion\r\nproposed for himself. But Laurence Fitzgibbon was such a poor\r\ncreature, that the idea of filling a place from which Laurence had\r\nrisen was distasteful to him. "It seems to be all a matter of favour\r\nand convenience," he said to himself, "without any reference to the\r\nservice." His triumph would have been so complete had Mr. Mildmay\r\nallowed him to go into the higher place at one leap. Other men who\r\nhad made themselves useful had done so. In the first hour after\r\nreceiving Lord Brentford\'s letter, the idea of becoming a Lord of the\r\nTreasury was almost displeasing to him. He had an idea that junior\r\nlordships of the Treasury were generally bestowed on young members\r\nwhom it was convenient to secure, but who were not good at doing\r\nanything. There was a moment in which he thought that he would refuse\r\nto be made a junior lord.\r\n\r\nBut during the night cooler reflections told him that he had been\r\nvery wrong. He had taken up politics with the express desire of\r\ngetting his foot upon a rung of the ladder of promotion, and now, in\r\nhis third session, he was about to be successful. Even as a junior\r\nlord he would have a thousand a year; and how long might he have sat\r\nin chambers, and have wandered about Lincoln\'s Inn, and have loitered\r\nin the courts striving to look as though he had business, before he\r\nwould have earned a thousand a year! Even as a junior lord he could\r\nmake himself useful, and when once he should be known to be a good\r\nworking man, promotion would come to him. No ladder can be mounted\r\nwithout labour; but this ladder was now open above his head, and he\r\nalready had his foot upon it.\r\n\r\nAt half-past eleven he was with Lord Brentford, who received him\r\nwith the blandest smile and a pressure of the hand which was quite\r\ncordial. "My dear Finn," he said, "this gives me the most sincere\r\npleasure,--the greatest pleasure in the world. Our connection\r\ntogether at Loughton of course makes it doubly agreeable to me."\r\n\r\n"I cannot be too grateful to you, Lord Brentford."\r\n\r\n"No, no; no, no. It is all your own doing. When Mr. Mildmay asked\r\nme whether I did not think you the most promising of the young\r\nmembers on our side in your House, I certainly did say that I quite\r\nconcurred. But I should be taking too much on myself, I should be\r\nacting dishonestly, if I were to allow you to imagine that it was my\r\nproposition. Had he asked me to recommend, I should have named you;\r\nthat I say frankly. But he did not. He did not. Mr. Mildmay named you\r\nhimself. \'Do you think,\' he said, \'that your friend Finn would join\r\nus at the Treasury?\' I told him that I did think so. \'And do you not\r\nthink,\' said he, \'that it would be a useful appointment?\' Then I\r\nventured to say that I had no doubt whatever on that point;--that I\r\nknew you well enough to feel confident that you would lend a strength\r\nto the Liberal Government. Then there were a few words said about\r\nyour seat, and I was commissioned to write to you. That was all."\r\n\r\nPhineas was grateful, but not too grateful, and bore himself very\r\nwell in the interview. He explained to Lord Brentford that of course\r\nit was his object to serve the country,--and to be paid for his\r\nservices,--and that he considered himself to be very fortunate to be\r\nselected so early in his career for parliamentary place. He would\r\nendeavour to do his duty, and could safely say of himself that he did\r\nnot wish to eat the bread of idleness. As he made this assertion, he\r\nthought of Laurence Fitzgibbon. Laurence Fitzgibbon had eaten the\r\nbread of idleness, and yet he was promoted. But Phineas said nothing\r\nto Lord Brentford about his idle friend. When he had made his little\r\nspeech he asked a question about the borough.\r\n\r\n"I have already ventured to write a letter to my agent at Loughton,\r\ntelling him that you have accepted office, and that you will be\r\nshortly there again. He will see Shortribs and arrange it. But if I\r\nwere you I should write to Shortribs and to Grating,--after I had\r\nseen Mr. Mildmay. Of course you will not mention my name," And the\r\nEarl looked very grave as he uttered this caution.\r\n\r\n"Of course I will not," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"I do not think you\'ll find any difficulty about the seat," said the\r\npeer. "There never has been any difficulty at Loughton yet. I must\r\nsay that for them. And if we can scrape through with Clause 72 we\r\nshall be all right;--shall we not?" This was the clause as to which\r\nso violent an opposition was expected from Mr. Turnbull,--a clause as\r\nto which Phineas himself had felt that he would hardly know how to\r\nsupport the Government, in the event of the committee being pressed\r\nto a division upon it. Could he, an ardent reformer, a reformer\r\nat heart,--could he say that such a borough as Loughton should be\r\nspared;--that the arrangement by which Shortribs and Grating had sent\r\nhim to Parliament, in obedience to Lord Brentford\'s orders, was in\r\ndue accord with the theory of a representative legislature? In what\r\nrespect had Gatton and Old Sarum been worse than Loughton? Was he\r\nnot himself false to his principle in sitting for such a borough\r\nas Loughton? He had spoken to Mr. Monk, and Mr. Monk had told him\r\nthat Rome was not built in a day,--and had told him also that good\r\nthings were most valued and were more valuable when they came by\r\ninstalments. But then Mr. Monk himself enjoyed the satisfaction of\r\nsitting for a popular Constituency. He was not personally pricked\r\nin the conscience by his own parliamentary position. Now, however,\r\n--now that Phineas had consented to join the Government, any such\r\nconsiderations as these must be laid aside. He could no longer be a\r\nfree agent, or even a free thinker. He had been quite aware of this,\r\nand had taught himself to understand that members of Parliament in\r\nthe direct service of the Government were absolved from the necessity\r\nof free-thinking. Individual free-thinking was incompatible with the\r\nposition of a member of the Government, and unless such abnegation\r\nwere practised, no government would be possible. It was of course a\r\nman\'s duty to bind himself together with no other men but those with\r\nwhom, on matters of general policy, he could agree heartily;--but\r\nhaving found that he could so agree, he knew that it would be his\r\nduty as a subaltern to vote as he was directed. It would trouble his\r\nconscience less to sit for Loughton and vote for an objectionable\r\nclause as a member of the Government, than it would have done to give\r\nsuch a vote as an independent member. In so resolving, he thought\r\nthat he was simply acting in accordance with the acknowledged rules\r\nof parliamentary government. And therefore, when Lord Brentford spoke\r\nof Clause 72, he could answer pleasantly, "I think we shall carry\r\nit; and, you see, in getting it through committee, if we can carry\r\nit by one, that is as good as a hundred. That\'s the comfort of\r\nclose-fighting in committee. In the open House we are almost as much\r\nbeaten by a narrow majority as by a vote against us."\r\n\r\n"Just so; just so," said Lord Brentford, delighted to see that his\r\nyoung pupil,--as he regarded him,--understood so well the system of\r\nparliamentary management. "By-the-bye, Finn, have you seen Chiltern\r\nlately?"\r\n\r\n"Not quite lately," said Phineas, blushing up to his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Or heard from him?"\r\n\r\n"No;--nor heard from him. When last I heard of him he was in\r\nBrussels."\r\n\r\n"Ah,--yes; he is somewhere on the Rhine now. I thought that as you\r\nwere so intimate, perhaps you corresponded with him. Have you heard\r\nthat we have arranged about Lady Laura\'s money?"\r\n\r\n"I have heard. Lady Laura has told me."\r\n\r\n"I wish he would return," said Lord Brentford sadly,--almost\r\nsolemnly. "As that great difficulty is over, I would receive him\r\nwillingly, and make my house pleasant to him, if I can do so. I am\r\nmost anxious that he should settle, and marry. Could you not write\r\nto him?" Phineas, not daring to tell Lord Brentford that he had\r\nquarrelled with Lord Chiltern,--feeling that if he did so everything\r\nwould go wrong,--said that he would write to Lord Chiltern.\r\n\r\nAs he went away he felt that he was bound to get an answer from\r\nViolet Effingham. If it should be necessary, he was willing to break\r\nwith Lord Brentford on that matter,--even though such breaking should\r\nlose him his borough and his place;--but not on any other matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\nPhineas and His Friends\r\n\r\n\r\nOur hero\'s friends were, I think, almost more elated by our hero\'s\r\npromotion than was our hero himself. He never told himself that it\r\nwas a great thing to be a junior lord of the Treasury, though he\r\nacknowledged to himself that to have made a successful beginning\r\nwas a very great thing. But his friends were loud in their\r\ncongratulations,--or condolements as the case might be.\r\n\r\nHe had his interview with Mr. Mildmay, and, after that, one of\r\nhis first steps was to inform Mrs. Bunce that he must change his\r\nlodgings. "The truth is, Mrs. Bunce, not that I want anything better;\r\nbut that a better position will be advantageous to me, and that I\r\ncan afford to pay for it." Mrs. Bunce acknowledged the truth of the\r\nargument, with her apron up to her eyes. "I\'ve got to be so fond of\r\nlooking after you, Mr. Finn! I have indeed," said Mrs. Bunce. "It is\r\nnot just what you pays like, because another party will pay as much.\r\nBut we\'ve got so used to you, Mr. Finn,--haven\'t we?" Mrs. Bunce was\r\nprobably not aware herself that the comeliness of her lodger had\r\npleased her feminine eye, and touched her feminine heart. Had anybody\r\nsaid that Mrs. Bunce was in love with Phineas, the scandal would have\r\nbeen monstrous. And yet it was so,--after a fashion. And Bunce knew\r\nit,--after his fashion. "Don\'t be such an old fool," he said, "crying\r\nafter him because he\'s six foot high." "I ain\'t crying after him\r\nbecause he\'s six foot high," whined the poor woman;--"but one does\r\nlike old faces better than new, and a gentleman about one\'s place\r\nis pleasant." "Gentleman be d----d," said Bunce. But his anger was\r\nexcited, not by his wife\'s love for Phineas, but by the use of an\r\nobjectionable word.\r\n\r\nBunce himself had been on very friendly terms with Phineas, and they\r\ntwo had had many discussions on matters of politics, Bunce taking\r\nup the cudgels always for Mr. Turnbull, and generally slipping away\r\ngradually into some account of his own martyrdom. For he had been a\r\nmartyr, having failed in obtaining any redress against the policeman\r\nwho had imprisoned him so wrongfully. The _People\'s Banner_\r\nhad fought for him manfully, and therefore there was a little\r\ndisagreement between him and Phineas on the subject of that great\r\norgan of public opinion. And as Mr. Bunce thought that his lodger\r\nwas very wrong to sit for Lord Brentford\'s borough, subjects were\r\nsometimes touched which were a little galling to Phineas.\r\n\r\nTouching this promotion, Bunce had nothing but condolement to offer\r\nto the new junior lord. "Oh yes," said he, in answer to an argument\r\nfrom Phineas, "I suppose there must be lords, as you call \'em; though\r\nfor the matter of that I can\'t see as they is of any mortal use."\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t you have the Government carried on?"\r\n\r\n"Government! Well; I suppose there must be government. But the less\r\nof it the better. I\'m not against government;--nor yet against laws,\r\nMr. Finn; though the less of them, too, the better. But what does\r\nthese lords do in the Government? Lords indeed! I\'ll tell you what\r\nthey do, Mr. Finn. They wotes; that\'s what they do! They wotes hard;\r\nblack or white, white or black. Ain\'t that true? When you\'re a\r\n\'lord,\' will you be able to wote against Mr. Mildmay to save your\r\nvery soul?"\r\n\r\n"If it comes to be a question of soul-saving, Mr. Bunce, I shan\'t\r\nsave my place at the expense of my conscience."\r\n\r\n"Not if you knows it, you mean. But the worst of it is that a man\r\ngets so thick into the mud that he don\'t know whether he\'s dirty or\r\nclean. You\'ll have to wote as you\'re told, and of course you\'ll think\r\nit\'s right enough. Ain\'t you been among Parliament gents long enough\r\nto know that that\'s the way it goes?"\r\n\r\n"You think no honest man can be a member of the Government?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say that, but I think honesty\'s a deal easier away from \'em.\r\nThe fact is, Mr. Finn, it\'s all wrong with us yet, and will be till\r\nwe get it nigher to the great American model. If a poor man gets into\r\nParliament,--you\'ll excuse me, Mr. Finn, but I calls you a poor man."\r\n\r\n"Certainly,--as a member of Parliament I am a very poor man."\r\n\r\n"Just so,--and therefore what do you do? You goes and lays yourself\r\nout for government! I\'m not saying as how you\'re anyways wrong. A man\r\nhas to live. You has winning ways, and a good physiognomy of your\r\nown, and are as big as a life-guardsman." Phineas as he heard this\r\ndoubtful praise laughed and blushed. "Very well; you makes your\r\nway with the big wigs, lords and earls and them like, and you gets\r\nreturned for a rotten borough;--you\'ll excuse me, but that\'s about\r\nit, ain\'t it?--and then you goes in for government! A man may have\r\na mission to govern, such as Washington and Cromwell and the like\r\no\' them. But when I hears of Mr. Fitzgibbon a-governing, why then I\r\nsays,--d----n it all."\r\n\r\n"There must be good and bad you know."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got to change a deal yet, Mr. Finn, and we\'ll do it. When a\r\nyoung man as has liberal feelings gets into Parliament, he shouldn\'t\r\nbe snapped up and brought into the governing business just because\r\nhe\'s poor and wants a salary. They don\'t do it that way in the\r\nStates; and they won\'t do it that way here long. It\'s the system as I\r\nhates, and not you, Mr. Finn. Well, good-bye, sir. I hope you\'ll like\r\nthe governing business, and find it suits your health."\r\n\r\nThese condolements from Mr. Bunce were not pleasant, but they set\r\nhim thinking. He felt assured that Bunce and Quintus Slide and Mr.\r\nTurnbull were wrong. Bunce was ignorant. Quintus Slide was dishonest.\r\nTurnbull was greedy of popularity. For himself, he thought that as a\r\nyoung man he was fairly well informed. He knew that he meant to be\r\ntrue in his vocation. And he was quite sure that the object nearest\r\nto his heart in politics was not self-aggrandisement, but the welfare\r\nof the people in general. And yet he could not but agree with Bunce\r\nthat there was something wrong. When such men as Laurence Fitzgibbon\r\nwere called upon to act as governors, was it not to be expected\r\nthat the ignorant but still intelligent Bunces of the population\r\nshould--"d----n it all"?\r\n\r\nOn the evening of that day he went up to Mrs. Low\'s, very sure that\r\nhe should receive some encouragement from her and from her husband.\r\nShe had been angry with him because he had put himself into a\r\nposition in which money must be spent and none could be made. The\r\nLows, especially Mrs. Low, had refused to believe that any success\r\nwas within his reach. Now that he had succeeded, now that he was in\r\nreceipt of a salary on which he could live and save money, he would\r\nbe sure of sympathy from his old friends the Lows!\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Low was as severe upon him as Mr. Bunce had been, and\r\neven from Mr. Low he could extract no real comfort. "Of course I\r\ncongratulate you," said Mr. Low coldly.\r\n\r\n"And you, Mrs. Low?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you know, Mr. Finn, I think you have begun at the wrong end. I\r\nthought so before, and I think so still. I suppose I ought not to say\r\nso to a Lord of the Treasury, but if you ask me, what can I do?"\r\n\r\n"Speak the truth out, of course."\r\n\r\n"Exactly. That\'s what I must do. Well, the truth is, Mr. Finn, that\r\nI do not think it is a very good opening for a young man to be made\r\nwhat they call a Lord of the Treasury,--unless he has got a private\r\nfortune, you know, to support that kind of life."\r\n\r\n"You see, Phineas, a ministry is such an uncertain thing," said Mr.\r\nLow.\r\n\r\n"Of course it\'s uncertain;--but as I did go into the House, it\'s\r\nsomething to have succeeded."\r\n\r\n"If you call that success," said Mrs. Low.\r\n\r\n"You did intend to go on with your profession," said Mr. Low. He\r\ncould not tell them that he had changed his mind, and that he meant\r\nto marry Violet Effingham, who would much prefer a parliamentary life\r\nfor her husband to that of a working barrister. "I suppose that is\r\nall given up now," continued Mr. Low.\r\n\r\n"Just for the present," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--and for ever I fear," said Mrs. Low, "You\'ll never go back to\r\nreal work after frittering away your time as a Lord of the Treasury.\r\nWhat sort of work must it be when just anybody can do it that it\r\nsuits them to lay hold of? But of course a thousand a year is\r\nsomething, though a man may have it for only six months."\r\n\r\nIt came out in the course of the evening that Mr. Low was going\r\nto stand for the borough vacated by Mr. Mottram, at which it was\r\nconsidered that the Conservatives might possibly prevail. "You see,\r\nafter all, Phineas," said Mr. Low, "that I am following your steps."\r\n\r\n"Ah; you are going into the House in the course of your profession."\r\n\r\n"Just so," said Mrs. Low.\r\n\r\n"And are taking the first step towards being a Tory\r\nAttorney-General."\r\n\r\n"That\'s as may be," said Mr. Low. "But it\'s the kind of thing a man\r\ndoes after twenty years of hard work. For myself, I really don\'t\r\ncare much whether I succeed or fail. I should like to live to be a\r\nVice-Chancellor. I don\'t mind saying as much as that to you. But I\'m\r\nnot at all sure that Parliament is the best way to the Equity Bench."\r\n\r\n"But it is a grand thing to get into Parliament when you do it by\r\nmeans of your profession," said Mrs. Low.\r\n\r\nSoon after that Phineas took his departure from the house, feeling\r\nsore and unhappy. But on the next morning he was received in\r\nGrosvenor Place with an amount of triumph which went far to\r\ncompensate him. Lady Laura had written to him to call there, and on\r\nhis arrival he found both Violet Effingham and Madame Max Goesler\r\nwith his friend. When Phineas entered the room his first feeling was\r\none of intense joy at seeing that Violet Effingham was present there.\r\nThen there was one of surprise that Madame Max Goesler should make\r\none of the little party. Lady Laura had told him at Mr. Palliser\'s\r\ndinner-party that they, in Portman Square, had not as yet advanced\r\nfar enough to receive Madame Max Goesler,--and yet here was the lady\r\nin Mr. Kennedy\'s drawing-room. Now Phineas would have thought it more\r\nlikely that he should find her in Portman Square than in Grosvenor\r\nPlace. The truth was that Madame Goesler had been brought by Miss\r\nEffingham,--with the consent, indeed, of Lady Laura, but with a\r\nconsent given with much of hesitation. "What are you afraid of?"\r\nViolet had asked. "I am afraid of nothing," Lady Laura had answered;\r\n"but one has to choose one\'s acquaintance in accordance with rules\r\nwhich one doesn\'t lay down very strictly." "She is a clever woman,"\r\nsaid Violet, "and everybody likes her; but if you think Mr. Kennedy\r\nwould object, of course you are right." Then Lady Laura had\r\nconsented, telling herself that it was not necessary that she should\r\nask her husband\'s approval as to every new acquaintance she might\r\nform. At the same time Violet had been told that Phineas would be\r\nthere, and so the party had been made up.\r\n\r\n"\'See the conquering hero comes,\' said Violet in her cheeriest voice.\r\n\r\n"I am so glad that Mr. Finn has been made a lord of something,"\r\nsaid Madame Max Goesler. "I had the pleasure of a long political\r\ndiscussion with him the other night, and I quite approve of him."\r\n\r\n"We are so much gratified, Mr. Finn," said Lady Laura. "Mr. Kennedy\r\nsays that it is the best appointment they could have made, and papa\r\nis quite proud about it."\r\n\r\n"You are Lord Brentford\'s member; are you not?" asked Madame Max\r\nGoesler. This was a question which Phineas did not quite like, and\r\nwhich he was obliged to excuse by remembering that the questioner had\r\nlived so long out of England as to be probably ignorant of the myths,\r\nand theories, and system, and working of the British Constitution.\r\nViolet Effingham, little as she knew of politics, would never have\r\nasked a question so imprudent.\r\n\r\nBut the question was turned off, and Phineas, with an easy grace,\r\nsubmitted himself to be petted, and congratulated, and purred\r\nover, and almost caressed by the three ladies, Their good-natured\r\nenthusiasm was at any rate better than the satire of Bunce, or the\r\nwisdom of Mrs. Low. Lady Laura had no misgivings as to Phineas being\r\nfit for governing, and Violet Effingham said nothing as to the\r\nshort-lived tenure of ministers. Madame Max Goesler, though she had\r\nasked an indiscreet question, thoroughly appreciated the advantage\r\nof Government pay, and the prestige of Government power. "You are a\r\nlord now," she said, speaking, as was customary with her, with the\r\nslightest possible foreign accent, "and you will be a president soon,\r\nand then perhaps a secretary. The order of promotion seems odd, but I\r\nam told it is very pleasant."\r\n\r\n"It is pleasant to succeed, of course," said Phineas, "let the\r\nsuccess be ever so little."\r\n\r\n"We knew you would succeed," said Lady Laura. "We were quite sure of\r\nit. Were we not, Violet?"\r\n\r\n"You always said so, my dear. For myself I do not venture to have\r\nan opinion on such matters. Will you always have to go to that big\r\nbuilding in the corner, Mr. Finn, and stay there from ten till four?\r\nWon\'t that be a bore?"\r\n\r\n"We have a half-holiday on Saturday, you know," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"And do the Lords of the Treasury have to take care of the money?"\r\nasked Madame Max Goesler.\r\n\r\n"Only their own; and they generally fail in doing that," said\r\nPhineas.\r\n\r\nHe sat there for a considerable time, wondering whether Mr. Kennedy\r\nwould come in, and wondering also as to what Mr. Kennedy would say to\r\nMadame Max Goesler when he did come in. He knew that it was useless\r\nfor him to expect any opportunity, then or there, of being alone for\r\na moment with Violet Effingham. His only chance in that direction\r\nwould be in some crowded room, at some ball at which he might ask her\r\nto dance with him; but it seemed that fate was very unkind to him,\r\nand that no such chance came in his way. Mr. Kennedy did not appear,\r\nand Madame Max Goesler with Violet went away, leaving Phineas still\r\nsitting with Lady Laura. Each of them said a kind word to him as\r\nthey went. "I don\'t know whether I may dare to expect that a Lord of\r\nthe Treasury will come and see me?" said Madame Max Goesler. Then\r\nPhineas made a second promise that he would call in Park Lane. Violet\r\nblushed as she remembered that she could not ask him to call at Lady\r\nBaldock\'s. "Good-bye, Mr. Finn," she said, giving him her hand.\r\n"I\'m so very glad that they have chosen you; and I do hope that, as\r\nMadame Max says, they\'ll make you a secretary and a president, and\r\neverything else very quickly,--till it will come to your turn to\r\nbe making other people." "He is very nice," said Madame Goesler to\r\nViolet as she took her place in the carriage. "He bears being petted\r\nand spoilt without being either awkward or conceited." "On the whole,\r\nhe is rather nice," said Violet; "only he has not got a shilling in\r\nthe world, and has to make himself before he will be anybody." "He\r\nmust marry money, of course," said Madame Max Goesler.\r\n\r\n"I hope you are contented?" said Lady Laura, rising from her chair\r\nand coming opposite to him as soon as they were alone.\r\n\r\n"Of course I am contented."\r\n\r\n"I was not,--when I first heard of it. Why did they promote that\r\nempty-headed countryman of yours to a place for which he was quite\r\nunfit? I was not contented. But then I am more ambitious for you than\r\nyou are for yourself." He sat without answering her for awhile, and\r\nshe stood waiting for his reply. "Have you nothing to say to me?" she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"I do not know what to say. When I think of it all, I am lost in\r\namazement. You tell me that you are not contented;--that you are\r\nambitious for me. Why is it that you should feel any interest in the\r\nmatter?"\r\n\r\n"Is it not reasonable that we should be interested for our friends?"\r\n\r\n"But when you and I last parted here in this room you were hardly my\r\nfriend."\r\n\r\n"Was I not? You wrong me there;--very deeply."\r\n\r\n"I told you what was my ambition, and you resented it," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"I think I said that I could not help you, and I think I said also\r\nthat I thought you would fail. I do not know that I showed much\r\nresentment. You see, I told her that you were here, that she might\r\ncome and meet you. You know that I wished my brother should succeed.\r\nI wished it before I ever knew you. You cannot expect that I should\r\nchange my wishes."\r\n\r\n"But if he cannot succeed," pleaded Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Who is to say that? Has a woman never been won by devotion and\r\nperseverance? Besides, how can I wish to see you go on with a suit\r\nwhich must sever you from my father, and injure your political\r\nprospects;--perhaps fatally injure them? It seems to me now that my\r\nfather is almost the only man in London who has not heard of this\r\nduel."\r\n\r\n"Of course he will hear of it. I have half made up my mind to tell\r\nhim myself."\r\n\r\n"Do not do that, Mr. Finn. There can be no reason for it. But I\r\ndid not ask you to come here to-day to talk to you about Oswald or\r\nViolet. I have given you my advice about that, and I can do no more."\r\n\r\n"Lady Laura, I cannot take it. It is out of my power to take it."\r\n\r\n"Very well. The matter shall be what you members of Parliament call\r\nan open question between us. When papa asked you to accept this place\r\nat the Treasury, did it ever occur to you to refuse it?"\r\n\r\n"It did;--for half an hour or so."\r\n\r\n"I hoped you would,--and yet I knew that I was wrong. I thought that\r\nyou should count yourself to be worth more than that, and that you\r\nshould, as it were, assert yourself. But then it is so difficult\r\nto draw the line between proper self-assertion and proper\r\nself-denial;--to know how high to go up the table, and how low to\r\ngo down. I do not doubt that you have been right,--only make them\r\nunderstand that you are not as other junior lords;--that you have\r\nbeen willing to be a junior lord, or anything else for a purpose;\r\nbut that the purpose is something higher than that of fetching and\r\ncarrying in Parliament for Mr. Mildmay and Mr. Palliser."\r\n\r\n"I hope in time to get beyond fetching and carrying," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Of course you will; and knowing that, I am glad that you are in\r\noffice. I suppose there will be no difficulty about Loughton."\r\n\r\nThen Phineas laughed. "I hear," said he, "that Mr. Quintus Slide,\r\nof the _People\'s Banner_, has already gone down to canvass the\r\nelectors."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Quintus Slide! To canvass the electors of Loughton!" and Lady\r\nLaura drew herself up and spoke of this unseemly intrusion on her\r\nfather\'s borough, as though the vulgar man who had been named had\r\nforced his way into the very drawing-room in Portman Square. At that\r\nmoment Mr. Kennedy came in. "Do you hear what Mr. Finn tells me?" she\r\nsaid. "He has heard that Mr. Quintus Slide has gone down to Loughton\r\nto stand against him."\r\n\r\n"And why not?" said Mr. Kennedy.\r\n\r\n"My dear!" ejaculated Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Quintus Slide will no doubt lose his time and his money;--but he\r\nwill gain the prestige of having stood for a borough, which will be\r\nsomething for him on the staff of the _People\'s Banner_," said Mr.\r\nKennedy.\r\n\r\n"He will get that horrid man Vellum to propose him," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"Very likely," said Mr. Kennedy. "And the less any of us say about\r\nit the better. Finn, my dear fellow, I congratulate you heartily.\r\nNothing for a long time has given me greater pleasure than hearing\r\nof your appointment. It is equally honourable to yourself and to Mr.\r\nMildmay. It is a great step to have gained so early."\r\n\r\nPhineas, as he thanked his friend, could not help asking himself what\r\nhis friend had done to be made a Cabinet Minister. Little as he,\r\nPhineas, himself had done in the House in his two sessions and a\r\nhalf, Mr. Kennedy had hardly done more in his fifteen or twenty. But\r\nthen Mr. Kennedy was possessed of almost miraculous wealth, and owned\r\nhalf a county, whereas he, Phineas, owned almost nothing at all.\r\nOf course no Prime Minister would offer a junior lordship at the\r\nTreasury to a man with L30,000 a year. Soon after this Phineas took\r\nhis leave. "I think he will do well," said Mr. Kennedy to his wife.\r\n\r\n"I am sure he will do well," replied Lady Laura, almost scornfully.\r\n\r\n"He is not quite such a black swan with me as he is with you; but\r\nstill I think he will succeed, if he takes care of himself. It is\r\nastonishing how that absurd story of his duel with Chiltern has got\r\nabout."\r\n\r\n"It is impossible to prevent people talking," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"I suppose there was some quarrel, though neither of them will tell\r\nyou. They say it was about Miss Effingham. I should hardly think that\r\nFinn could have any hopes in that direction."\r\n\r\n"Why should he not have hopes?"\r\n\r\n"Because he has neither position, nor money, nor birth," said Mr.\r\nKennedy.\r\n\r\n"He is a gentleman." said Lady Laura; "and I think he has position. I\r\ndo not see why he should not ask any girl to marry him."\r\n\r\n"There is no understanding you, Laura," said Mr. Kennedy, angrily. "I\r\nthought you had quite other hopes about Miss Effingham."\r\n\r\n"So I have; but that has nothing to do with it. You spoke of Mr. Finn\r\nas though he would be guilty of some crime were he to ask Violet\r\nEffingham to be his wife. In that I disagree with you. Mr. Finn is--"\r\n\r\n"You will make me sick of the name of Mr. Finn."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry that I offend you by my gratitude to a man who saved your\r\nlife." Mr. Kennedy shook his head. He knew that the argument used\r\nagainst him was false, but he did not know how to show that he knew\r\nthat it was false. "Perhaps I had better not mention his name any\r\nmore," continued Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!"\r\n\r\n"I quite agree with you that it is nonsense, Robert."\r\n\r\n"All I mean to say is, that if you go on as you do, you will turn his\r\nhead and spoil him. Do you think I do not know what is going on among\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"And what is going on among us,--as you call it?"\r\n\r\n"You are taking this young man up and putting him on a pedestal and\r\nworshipping him, just because he is well-looking, and rather clever\r\nand decently behaved. It\'s always the way with women who have nothing\r\nto do, and who cannot be made to understand that they should have\r\nduties. They cannot live without some kind of idolatry."\r\n\r\n"Have I neglected my duty to you, Robert?"\r\n\r\n"Yes,--you know you have;--in going to those receptions at your\r\nfather\'s house on Sundays."\r\n\r\n"What has that to do with Mr. Finn?"\r\n\r\n"Psha!"\r\n\r\n"I begin to think I had better tell Mr. Finn not to come here any\r\nmore, since his presence is disagreeable to you. All the world knows\r\nhow great is the service he did you, and it will seem to be very\r\nridiculous. People will say all manner of things; but anything will\r\nbe better than that you should go on as you have done,--accusing your\r\nwife of idolatry towards--a young man, because--he is--well-looking."\r\n\r\n"I never said anything of the kind."\r\n\r\n"You did, Robert."\r\n\r\n"I did not. I did not speak more of you than of a lot of others."\r\n\r\n"You accused me personally, saying that because of my idolatry I had\r\nneglected my duty; but really you made such a jumble of it all, with\r\npapa\'s visitors, and Sunday afternoons, that I cannot follow what was\r\nin your mind."\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Kennedy stood for awhile, collecting his thoughts, so that\r\nhe might unravel the jumble, if that were possible to him; but\r\nfinding that it was not possible, he left the room, and closed the\r\ndoor behind him.\r\n\r\nThen Lady Laura was left alone to consider the nature of the\r\naccusation which her husband had brought against her; or the nature\r\nrather of the accusation which she had chosen to assert that her\r\nhusband had implied. For in her heart she knew that he had made no\r\nsuch accusation, and had intended to make none such. The idolatry of\r\nwhich he had spoken was the idolatry which a woman might show to her\r\ncat, her dog, her picture, her china, her furniture, her carriage and\r\nhorses, or her pet maid-servant. Such was the idolatry of which Mr.\r\nKennedy had spoken;--but was there no other worship in her heart,\r\nworse, more pernicious than that, in reference to this young man?\r\n\r\nShe had schooled herself about him very severely, and had come to\r\nvarious resolutions. She had found out and confessed to herself that\r\nshe did not, and could not, love her husband. She had found out and\r\nconfessed to herself that she did love, and could not help loving,\r\nPhineas Finn. Then she had resolved to banish him from her presence,\r\nand had gone the length of telling him so. After that she had\r\nperceived that she had been wrong, and had determined to meet him as\r\nshe met other men,--and to conquer her love. Then, when this could\r\nnot be done, when something almost like idolatry grew upon her, she\r\ndetermined that it should be the idolatry of friendship, that she\r\nwould not sin even in thought, that there should be nothing in her\r\nheart of which she need be ashamed;--but that the one great object\r\nand purport of her life should be the promotion of this friend\'s\r\nwelfare. She had just begun to love after this fashion, had taught\r\nherself to believe that she might combine something of the pleasure\r\nof idolatry towards her friend with a full complement of duty towards\r\nher husband, when Phineas came to her with his tale of love for\r\nViolet Effingham. The lesson which she got then was a very rough\r\none,--so hard that at first she could not bear it. Her anger at his\r\nlove for her brother\'s wished-for bride was lost in her dismay that\r\nPhineas should love any one after having once loved her. But by\r\nsheer force of mind she had conquered that dismay, that feeling of\r\ndesolation at her heart, and had almost taught herself to hope that\r\nPhineas might succeed with Violet. He wished it,--and why should he\r\nnot have what he wished,--he, whom she so fondly idolised? It was not\r\nhis fault that he and she were not man and wife. She had chosen to\r\narrange it otherwise, and was she not bound to assist him now in the\r\npresent object of his reasonable wishes? She had got over in her\r\nheart that difficulty about her brother, but she could not quite\r\nconquer the other difficulty. She could not bring herself to plead\r\nhis cause with Violet. She had not brought herself as yet to do it.\r\n\r\nAnd now she was accused of idolatry for Phineas by her husband,--she\r\nwith "a lot of others," in which lot Violet was of course included.\r\nWould it not be better that they two should be brought together?\r\nWould not her friend\'s husband still be her friend? Would she not\r\nthen forget to love him? Would she not then be safer than she was\r\nnow?\r\n\r\nAs she sat alone struggling with her difficulties, she had not as yet\r\nforgotten to love him,--nor was she as yet safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\nMiss Effingham\'s Four Lovers\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning early in June Lady Laura called at Lady Baldock\'s house\r\nand asked for Miss Effingham. The servant was showing her into\r\nthe large drawing-room, when she again asked specially for Miss\r\nEffingham. "I think Miss Effingham is there," said the man, opening\r\nthe door. Miss Effingham was not there. Lady Baldock was sitting\r\nall alone, and Lady Laura perceived that she had been caught in\r\nthe net which she specially wished to avoid. Now Lady Baldock had\r\nnot actually or openly quarrelled with Lady Laura Kennedy or with\r\nLord Brentford, but she had conceived a strong idea that her niece\r\nViolet was countenanced in all improprieties by the Standish family\r\ngenerally, and that therefore the Standish family was to be regarded\r\nas a family of enemies. There was doubtless in her mind considerable\r\nconfusion on the subject, for she did not know whether Lord Chiltern\r\nor Mr. Finn was the suitor whom she most feared,--and she was aware,\r\nafter a sort of muddled fashion, that the claims of these two wicked\r\nyoung men were antagonistic to each other. But they were both\r\nregarded by her as emanations from the same source of iniquity,\r\nand, therefore, without going deeply into the machinations of Lady\r\nLaura,--without resolving whether Lady Laura was injuring her by\r\npressing her brother as a suitor upon Miss Effingham, or by pressing\r\na rival of her brother,--still she became aware that it was her duty\r\nto turn a cold shoulder on those two houses in Portman Square and\r\nGrosvenor Place. But her difficulties in doing this were very great,\r\nand it may be said that Lady Baldock was placed in an unjust and\r\ncruel position. Before the end of May she had proposed to leave\r\nLondon, and to take her daughter and Violet down to Baddingham,--or\r\nto Brighton, if they preferred it, or to Switzerland. "Brighton in\r\nJune!" Violet had exclaimed. "Would not a month among the glaciers be\r\ndelightful!" Miss Boreham had said. "Don\'t let me keep you in town,\r\naunt," Violet replied; "but I do not think I shall go till other\r\npeople go. I can have a room at Laura Kennedy\'s house." Then Lady\r\nBaldock, whose position was hard and cruel, resolved that she would\r\nstay in town. Here she had in her hands a ward over whom she had no\r\npositive power, and yet in respect to whom her duty was imperative!\r\nHer duty was imperative, and Lady Baldock was not the woman to\r\nneglect her duty;--and yet she knew that the doing of her duty would\r\nall be in vain. Violet would marry a shoe-black out of the streets if\r\nshe were so minded. It was of no use that the poor lady had provided\r\nherself with two strings, two most excellent strings, to her\r\nbow,--two strings either one of which should have contented Miss\r\nEffingham. There was Lord Fawn, a young peer, not very rich\r\nindeed,--but still with means sufficient for a wife, a rising\r\nman, and in every way respectable, although a Whig. And there\r\nwas Mr. Appledom, one of the richest commoners in England, a\r\nfine Conservative too, with a seat in the House, and everything\r\nappropriate. He was fifty, but looked hardly more than thirty-five,\r\nand was,--so at least Lady Baldock frequently asserted,--violently in\r\nlove with Violet Effingham. Why had not the law, or the executors, or\r\nthe Lord Chancellor, or some power levied for the protection of the\r\nproprieties, made Violet absolutely subject to her guardian till she\r\nshould be made subject to a husband?\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think she is at home," said Lady Baldock, in answer to Lady\r\nLaura\'s inquiry for Violet. "At least, I hardly know. She seldom\r\ntells me what she means to do,--and sometimes she will walk out quite\r\nalone!" A most imprudent old woman was Lady Baldock, always opening\r\nher hand to her adversaries, unable to control herself in the\r\nscolding of people, either before their faces or behind their backs,\r\neven at moments in which such scolding was most injurious to her own\r\ncause. "However, we will see," she continued. Then the bell was rung,\r\nand in a few minutes Violet was in the room. In a few minutes more\r\nthey were up-stairs together in Violet\'s own room, in spite of the\r\nopenly-displayed wrath of Lady Baldock. "I almost wish she had never\r\nbeen born," said Lady Baldock to her daughter. "Oh, mamma, don\'t\r\nsay that." "I certainly do wish that I had never seen her." "Indeed\r\nshe has been a grievous trouble to you, mamma," said Miss Boreham,\r\nsympathetically.\r\n\r\n"Brighton! What nonsense!" said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"Of course it\'s nonsense. Fancy going to Brighton! And then they\r\nhave proposed Switzerland. If you could only hear Augusta talking in\r\nrapture of a month among the glaciers! And I feel so ungrateful. I\r\nbelieve they would spend three months with me at any horrible place\r\nthat I could suggest,--at Hong Kong if I were to ask it,--so intent\r\nare they on taking me away from metropolitan danger."\r\n\r\n"But you will not go?"\r\n\r\n"No!--I won\'t go. I know I am very naughty; but I can\'t help feeling\r\nthat I cannot be good without being a fool at the same time. I must\r\neither fight my aunt, or give way to her. If I were to yield, what a\r\nlife I should have;--and I should despise myself after all."\r\n\r\n"And what is the special danger to be feared now?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know;--you, I fancy. I told her that if she went, I should\r\ngo to you. I knew that would make her stay."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would come to me," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t think of it really,--not for any length of time."\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"Because I should be in Mr. Kennedy\'s way."\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t be in his way in the least. If you would only be down\r\npunctually for morning prayers, and go to church with him on Sunday\r\nafternoon, he would be delighted to have you."\r\n\r\n"What did he say about Madame Max coming?"\r\n\r\n"Not a word. I don\'t think he quite knew who she was then. I fancy he\r\nhas inquired since, by something he said yesterday."\r\n\r\n"What did he say?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing that matters;--only a word. I haven\'t come here to talk\r\nabout Madame Max Goesler,--nor yet about Mr. Kennedy."\r\n\r\n"Whom have you come to talk about?" asked Violet, laughing a little,\r\nwith something of increased colour in her cheeks, though she could\r\nnot be said to blush.\r\n\r\n"A lover of course," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"I wish you would leave me alone with my lovers. You are as bad or\r\nworse than my aunt. She, at any rate, varies her prescription. She\r\nhas become sick of poor Lord Fawn because he\'s a Whig."\r\n\r\n"And who is her favourite now?"\r\n\r\n"Old Mr. Appledom,--who is really a most unexceptionable old party,\r\nand whom I like of all things. I really think I could consent to be\r\nMrs. Appledom, to get rid of my troubles,--if he did not dye his\r\nwhiskers and have his coats padded."\r\n\r\n"He\'d give up those little things if you asked him."\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t have the heart to do it. Besides, this isn\'t his time of\r\nthe year for making proposals. His love fever, which is of a very low\r\nkind, and intermits annually, never comes on till the autumn. It is a\r\nrural malady, against which he is proof while among his clubs!"\r\n\r\n"Well, Violet,--I am like your aunt."\r\n\r\n"Like Lady Baldock?"\r\n\r\n"In one respect. I, too, will vary my prescription."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, Laura?"\r\n\r\n"Just this,--that if you like to marry Phineas Finn, I will say that\r\nyou are right."\r\n\r\n"Heaven and earth! And why am I to marry Phineas Finn?"\r\n\r\n"Only for two reasons; because he loves you, and because--"\r\n\r\n"No,--I deny it. I do not."\r\n\r\n"I had come to fancy that you did."\r\n\r\n"Keep your fancy more under control then. But upon my word I can\'t\r\nunderstand this. He was your great friend."\r\n\r\n"What has that to do with it?" demanded Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"And you have thrown over your brother, Laura?"\r\n\r\n"You have thrown him over. Is he to go on for ever asking and being\r\nrefused?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know why he should not," said Violet, "seeing how very\r\nlittle trouble it gives him. Half an hour once in six months does it\r\nall for him, allowing him time for coming and going in a cab."\r\n\r\n"Violet, I do not understand you. Have you refused Oswald so often\r\nbecause he does not pass hours on his knees before you?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed! His nature would be altered very much for the worse\r\nbefore he could do that."\r\n\r\n"Why do you throw it in his teeth then that he does not give you more\r\nof his time?"\r\n\r\n"Why have you come to tell me to marry Mr. Phineas Finn? That is what\r\nI want to know. Mr. Phineas Finn, as far as I am aware, has not a\r\nshilling in the world,--except a month\'s salary now due to him from\r\nthe Government. Mr. Phineas Finn I believe to be the son of a country\r\ndoctor in Ireland,--with about seven sisters. Mr. Phineas Finn is a\r\nRoman Catholic. Mr. Phineas Finn is,--or was a short time ago,--in\r\nlove with another lady; and Mr. Phineas Finn is not so much in\r\nlove at this moment but what he is able to intrust his cause to an\r\nambassador. None short of a royal suitor should ever do that with\r\nsuccess."\r\n\r\n"Has he never pleaded his cause to you himself?"\r\n\r\n"My dear, I never tell gentlemen\'s secrets. It seems that if he has,\r\nhis success was so trifling that he has thought he had better trust\r\nsome one else for the future."\r\n\r\n"He has not trusted me. He has not given me any commission."\r\n\r\n"Then why have you come?"\r\n\r\n"Because,--I hardly know how to tell his story. There have been\r\nthings about Oswald which made it almost necessary that Mr. Finn\r\nshould explain himself to me."\r\n\r\n"I know it all;--about their fighting. Foolish young men! I am not\r\na bit obliged to either of them,--not a bit. Only fancy, if my aunt\r\nknew it, what a life she would lead me! Gustavus knows all about it,\r\nand I feel that I am living at his mercy. Why were they so\r\nwrong-headed?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot answer that,--though I know them well enough to be sure\r\nthat Chiltern was the one in fault."\r\n\r\n"It is so odd that you should have thrown your brother over."\r\n\r\n"I have not thrown my brother over. Will you accept Oswald if he asks\r\nyou again?"\r\n\r\n"No," almost shouted Violet.\r\n\r\n"Then I hope that Mr. Finn may succeed. I want him to succeed in\r\neverything. There;--you may know it all. He is my Phoebus Apollo."\r\n\r\n"That is flattering to me,--looking at the position in which you\r\ndesire to place your Phoebus at the present moment."\r\n\r\n"Come, Violet, I am true to you, and let me have a little truth from\r\nyou. This man loves you, and I think is worthy of you. He does not\r\nlove me, but he is my friend. As his friend, and believing in his\r\nworth, I wish for his success beyond almost anything else in the\r\nworld. Listen to me, Violet. I don\'t believe in those reasons which\r\nyou gave me just now for not becoming this man\'s wife."\r\n\r\n"Nor do I."\r\n\r\n"I know you do not. Look at me. I, who have less of real heart than\r\nyou, I who thought that I could trust myself to satisfy my mind and\r\nmy ambition without caring for my heart, I have married for what you\r\ncall position. My husband is very rich, and a Cabinet Minister, and\r\nwill probably be a peer. And he was willing to marry me at a time\r\nwhen I had not a shilling of my own."\r\n\r\n"He was very generous."\r\n\r\n"He has asked for it since," said Lady Laura. "But never mind. I have\r\nnot come to talk about myself;--otherwise than to bid you not do what\r\nI have done. All that you have said about this man\'s want of money\r\nand of family is nothing."\r\n\r\n"Nothing at all," said Violet. "Mere words,--fit only for such people\r\nas my aunt."\r\n\r\n"Well then?"\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"If you love him--!"\r\n\r\n"Ah! but if I do not? You are very close in inquiring into my\r\nsecrets. Tell me, Laura;--was not this young Crichton once a lover of\r\nyour own?"\r\n\r\n"Psha! And do you think I cannot keep a gentleman\'s secret as well as\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"What is the good of any secret, Laura, when we have been already so\r\nopen? He tried his \'prentice hand on you; and then he came to me. Let\r\nus watch him, and see who\'ll be the third. I too like him well enough\r\nto hope that he\'ll land himself safely at last."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\nThe Mousetrap\r\n\r\n\r\nPhineas had certainly no desire to make love by an ambassador,--at\r\nsecond-hand. He had given no commission to Lady Laura, and was, as\r\nthe reader is aware, quite ignorant of what was being done and said\r\non his behalf. He had asked no more from Lady Laura than an\r\nopportunity of speaking for himself, and that he had asked almost\r\nwith a conviction that by so asking he would turn his friend into an\r\nenemy. He had read but little of the workings of Lady Laura\'s heart\r\ntowards himself, and had no idea of the assistance she was anxious to\r\ngive him. She had never told him that she was willing to sacrifice\r\nher brother on his behalf, and, of course, had not told him that she\r\nwas willing also to sacrifice herself. Nor, when she wrote to him one\r\nJune morning and told him that Violet would be found in Portman\r\nSquare, alone, that afternoon,--naming an hour, and explaining that\r\nMiss Effingham would be there to meet herself and her father, but\r\nthat at such an hour she would be certainly alone,--did he even then\r\nknow how much she was prepared to do for him. The short note was\r\nsigned "L.," and then there came a long postscript. "Ask for me," she\r\nsaid in a postscript. "I shall be there later, and I have told them\r\nto bid you wait. I can give you no hope of success, but if you choose\r\nto try,--you can do so. If you do not come, I shall know that you\r\nhave changed your mind. I shall not think the worse of you, and your\r\nsecret will be safe with me. I do that which you have asked me to\r\ndo,--simply because you have asked it. Burn this at once,--because I\r\nask it." Phineas destroyed the note, tearing it into atoms, the\r\nmoment that he had read it and re-read it. Of course he would go to\r\nPortman Square at the hour named. Of course he would take his chance.\r\nHe was not buoyed up by much of hope;--but even though there were no\r\nhope, he would take his chance.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Brentford had first told Phineas of his promotion, he had\r\nalso asked the new Lord of the Treasury to make a certain\r\ncommunication on his behalf to his son. This Phineas had found\r\nhimself obliged to promise to do;--and he had done it. The letter had\r\nbeen difficult enough to write,--but he had written it. After having\r\nmade the promise, he had found himself bound to keep it.\r\n\r\n"Dear Lord Chiltern," he had commenced, "I will not think that there\r\nwas anything in our late encounter to prevent my so addressing you. I\r\nnow write at the instance of your father, who has heard nothing of\r\nour little affair." Then he explained at length Lord Brentford\'s\r\nwishes as he understood them. "Pray come home," he said, finishing\r\nhis letter. "Touching V. E., I feel that I am bound to tell you that\r\nI still mean to try my fortune, but that I have no ground for hoping\r\nthat my fortune will be good. Since the day on the sands, I have\r\nnever met her but in society. I know you will be glad to hear that my\r\nwound was nothing; and I think you will be glad to hear that I have\r\ngot my foot on to the ladder of promotion.--Yours always,\r\n\r\n"PHINEAS FINN."\r\n\r\nNow he had to try his fortune,--that fortune of which he had told\r\nLord Chiltern that he had no reason for hoping that it would be good.\r\nHe went direct from his office at the Treasury to Portman Square,\r\nresolving that he would take no trouble as to his dress, simply\r\nwashing his hands and brushing his hair as though he were going down\r\nto the House, and he knocked at the Earl\'s door exactly at the hour\r\nnamed by Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"Miss Effingham," he said, "I am so glad to find you alone."\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said, laughing. "I am alone,--a poor unprotected female.\r\nBut I fear nothing. I have strong reason for believing that Lord\r\nBrentford is somewhere about. And Pomfret the butler, who has known\r\nme since I was a baby, is a host in himself."\r\n\r\n"With such allies you can have nothing to fear," he replied,\r\nattempting to carry on her little jest.\r\n\r\n"Nor even without them, Mr. Finn. We unprotected females in these\r\ndays are so self-reliant that our natural protectors fall off from\r\nus, finding themselves to be no longer wanted. Now with you,--what\r\ncan I fear?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing,--as I hope."\r\n\r\n"There used to be a time, and that not so long ago either, when young\r\ngentlemen and ladies were thought to be very dangerous to each other\r\nif they were left alone. But propriety is less rampant now, and upon\r\nthe whole virtue and morals, with discretion and all that kind of\r\nthing, have been the gainers. Don\'t you think so?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure of it."\r\n\r\n"All the same, but I don\'t like to be caught in a trap, Mr. Finn."\r\n\r\n"In a trap?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--in a trap. Is there no trap here? If you will say so, I will\r\nacknowledge myself to be a dolt, and will beg your pardon."\r\n\r\n"I hardly know what you call a trap."\r\n\r\n"You were told that I was here?"\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment before he replied. "Yes, I was told."\r\n\r\n"I call that a trap."\r\n\r\n"Am I to blame?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say that you set it,--but you use it."\r\n\r\n"Miss Effingham, of course I have used it. You must know,--I think\r\nyou must know that I have that to say to you which has made me long\r\nfor such an opportunity as this."\r\n\r\n"And therefore you have called in the assistance of your friend."\r\n\r\n"It is true."\r\n\r\n"In such matters you should never talk to any one, Mr. Finn. If you\r\ncannot fight your own battle, no one can fight it for you."\r\n\r\n"Miss Effingham, do you remember our ride at Saulsby?"\r\n\r\n"Very well;--as if it were yesterday."\r\n\r\n"And do you remember that I asked you a question which you have never\r\nanswered?"\r\n\r\n"I did answer it,--as well as I knew how, so that I might tell you a\r\ntruth without hurting you."\r\n\r\n"It was necessary,--is necessary that I should be hurt sorely, or\r\nmade perfectly happy. Violet Effingham, I have come to you to ask you\r\nto be my wife;--to tell you that I love you, and to ask for your love\r\nin return. Whatever may be my fate, the question must be asked, and\r\nan answer must be given. I have not hoped that you should tell me\r\nthat you loved me--"\r\n\r\n"For what then have you hoped?"\r\n\r\n"For not much, indeed;--but if for anything, then for some chance\r\nthat you might tell me so hereafter."\r\n\r\n"If I loved you, I would tell you so now,--instantly. I give you my\r\nword of that."\r\n\r\n"Can you never love me?"\r\n\r\n"What is a woman to answer to such a question? No;--I believe never.\r\nI do not think I shall ever wish you to be my husband. You ask me to\r\nbe plain, and I must be plain."\r\n\r\n"Is it because--?" He paused, hardly knowing what the question was\r\nwhich he proposed to himself to ask.\r\n\r\n"It is for no because,--for no cause except that simple one which\r\nshould make any girl refuse any man whom she did not love. Mr.\r\nFinn, I could say pleasant things to you on any other subject than\r\nthis,--because I like you."\r\n\r\n"I know that I have nothing to justify my suit."\r\n\r\n"You have everything to justify it;--at least I am bound to presume\r\nthat you have. If you love me,--you are justified."\r\n\r\n"You know that I love you."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry that it should ever have been so,--very sorry. I can only\r\nhope that I have not been in fault."\r\n\r\n"Will you try to love me?"\r\n\r\n"No;--why should I try? If any trying were necessary, I would try\r\nrather not to love you. Why should I try to do that which would\r\ndisplease everybody belonging to me? For yourself, I admit your right\r\nto address me,--and tell you frankly that it would not be in vain, if\r\nI loved you. But I tell you as frankly that such a marriage would not\r\nplease those whom I am bound to try to please."\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment before he spoke further. "I shall wait," he said,\r\n"and come again."\r\n\r\n"What am I to say to that? Do not tease me, so that I be driven to\r\ntreat you with lack of courtesy. Lady Laura is so much attached to\r\nyou, and Mr. Kennedy, and Lord Brentford,--and indeed I may say,\r\nI myself also, that I trust there may be nothing to mar our good\r\nfellowship. Come, Mr. Finn,--say that you will take an answer, and\r\nI will give you my hand."\r\n\r\n"Give it me," said he. She gave him her hand, and he put it up to his\r\nlips and pressed it. "I will wait and come again," he said. "I will\r\nassuredly come again." Then he turned from her and went out of the\r\nhouse. At the corner of the square he saw Lady Laura\'s carriage, but\r\ndid not stop to speak to her. And she also saw him.\r\n\r\n"So you have had a visitor here," said Lady Laura to Violet.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I have been caught in the trap."\r\n\r\n"Poor mouse! And has the cat made a meal of you?"\r\n\r\n"I fancy he has, after his fashion. There be cats that eat their mice\r\nwithout playing,--and cats that play with their mice, and then eat\r\nthem; and cats again which only play with their mice, and don\'t care\r\nto eat them. Mr. Finn is a cat of the latter kind, and has had his\r\nafternoon\'s diversion."\r\n\r\n"You wrong him there."\r\n\r\n"I think not, Laura. I do not mean to say that he would not have\r\nliked me to accept him. But, if I can see inside his bosom, such a\r\nlittle job as that he has now done will be looked back upon as one of\r\nthe past pleasures of his life;--not as a pain."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\nMr. Mildmay\'s Bill\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary that we should go back in our story for a very\r\nshort period in order that the reader may be told that Phineas Finn\r\nwas duly re-elected at Loughton after his appointment at the Treasury\r\nBoard. There was some little trouble at Loughton, and something\r\nmore of expense than he had before encountered. Mr. Quintus Slide\r\nabsolutely came down, and was proposed by Mr. Vellum for the borough.\r\nMr. Vellum being a gentleman learned in the law, and hostile to the\r\ninterests of the noble owner of Saulsby, was able to raise a little\r\ntrouble against our hero. Mr. Slide was proposed by Mr. Vellum, and\r\nseconded by Mr. Vellum\'s clerk,--though, as it afterwards appeared,\r\nMr. Vellum\'s clerk was not in truth an elector,--and went to the poll\r\nlike a man. He received three votes, and at twelve o\'clock withdrew.\r\nThis in itself could hardly have afforded compensation for the\r\nexpense which Mr. Slide or his backers must have encountered;--but\r\nhe had an opportunity of making a speech, every word of which was\r\nreported in the _People\'s Banner_; and if the speech was made in the\r\nlanguage given in the report, Mr. Slide was really possessed of some\r\noratorical power. Most of those who read the speech in the columns\r\nof the _People\'s Banner_ were probably not aware how favourable an\r\nopportunity of retouching his sentences in type had been given to Mr.\r\nSlide by the fact of his connection with the newspaper. The speech\r\nhad been very severe upon our hero; and though the speaker had\r\nbeen so hooted and pelted at Loughton as to have been altogether\r\ninaudible,--so maltreated that in point of fact he had not been able\r\nto speak above a tenth part of his speech at all,--nevertheless the\r\nspeech did give Phineas a certain amount of pain. Why Phineas should\r\nhave read it who can tell? But who is there that abstains from\r\nreading that which is printed in abuse of himself?\r\n\r\nIn the speech as it was printed Mr. Slide declared that he had no\r\nthought of being returned for the borough. He knew too well how\r\nthe borough was managed, what slaves the electors were;--how they\r\ngroaned under a tyranny from which hitherto they had been unable\r\nto release themselves. Of course the Earl\'s nominee, his lacquey,\r\nas the honourable gentleman might be called, would be returned.\r\nThe Earl could order them to return whichever of his lacqueys he\r\npleased.--There is something peculiarly pleasing to the democratic\r\near in the word lacquey! Any one serving a big man, whatever\r\nthe service may be, is the big man\'s lacquey in the _People\'s\r\nBanner_.--The speech throughout was very bitter. Mr. Phineas Finn,\r\nwho had previously served in Parliament as the lacquey of an Irish\r\nearl, and had been turned off by him, had now fallen into the service\r\nof the English earl, and was the lacquey chosen for the present\r\noccasion. But he, Quintus Slide, who boasted himself to be a man\r\nof the people,--he could tell them that the days of their thraldom\r\nwere coming to an end, and that their enfranchisement was near at\r\nhand. That friend of the people, Mr. Turnbull, had a clause in his\r\nbreeches-pocket which he would either force down the unwilling throat\r\nof Mr. Mildmay, or else drive the imbecile Premier from office by\r\ncarrying it in his teeth. Loughton, as Loughton, must be destroyed,\r\nbut it should be born again in a better birth as a part of a\r\nreal electoral district, sending a real member, chosen by a real\r\nconstituency, to a real Parliament. In those days,--and they would\r\ncome soon,--Mr. Quintus Slide rather thought that Mr. Phineas Finn\r\nwould be found "nowhere," and he rather thought also that when he\r\nshowed himself again, as he certainly should do, in the midst of that\r\ndemocratic electoral district as the popular candidate for the honour\r\nof representing it in Parliament, that democratic electoral district\r\nwould accord to him a reception very different from that which he\r\nwas now receiving from the Earl\'s lacqueys in the parliamentary\r\nvillage of Loughton. A prettier bit of fiction than these sentences\r\nas composing a part of any speech delivered, or proposed to be\r\ndelivered, at Loughton, Phineas thought he had never seen. And when\r\nhe read at the close of the speech that though the Earl\'s hired\r\nbullies did their worst, the remarks of Mr. Slide were received by\r\nthe people with reiterated cheering, he threw himself back in his\r\nchair at the Treasury and roared. The poor fellow had been three\r\nminutes on his legs, had received three rotten eggs, and one dead\r\ndog, and had retired. But not the half of the speech as printed in\r\nthe _People\'s Banner_ has been quoted. The sins of Phineas, who in\r\nspite of his inability to open his mouth in public had been made\r\na Treasury hack by the aristocratic influence,--"by aristocratic\r\ninfluence not confined to the male sex,"--were described at great\r\nlength, and in such language that Phineas for a while was fool enough\r\nto think that it would be his duty to belabour Mr. Slide with a\r\nhorsewhip. This notion, however, did not endure long with him, and\r\nwhen Mr. Monk told him that things of that kind came as a matter of\r\ncourse, he was comforted.\r\n\r\nBut he found it much more difficult to obtain comfort when he weighed\r\nthe arguments brought forward against the abominations of such a\r\nborough as that for which he sat, and reflected that if Mr. Turnbull\r\nbrought forward his clause, he, Phineas Finn, would be bound to vote\r\nagainst the clause, knowing the clause to be right, because he was a\r\nservant of the Government. The arguments, even though they appeared\r\nin the _People\'s Banner_, were true arguments; and he had on one\r\noccasion admitted their truth to his friend Lady Laura,--in the\r\npresence of that great Cabinet Minister, her husband. "What business\r\nhas such a man as that down there? Is there a single creature who\r\nwants him?" Lady Laura had said. "I don\'t suppose anybody does want\r\nMr. Quintus Slide," Phineas had replied; "but I am disposed to think\r\nthe electors should choose the man they do want, and that at present\r\nthey have no choice left to them." "They are quite satisfied," said\r\nLady Laura, angrily. "Then, Lady Laura," continued Phineas, "that\r\nalone should be sufficient to prove that their privilege of returning\r\na member to Parliament is too much for them. We can\'t defend it."\r\n"It is defended by tradition," said Mr. Kennedy. "And by its great\r\nutility," said Lady Laura, bowing to the young member who was\r\npresent, and forgetting that very useless old gentleman, her cousin,\r\nwho had sat for the borough for many years. "In this country it\r\ndoesn\'t do to go too fast," said Mr. Kennedy. "And then the mixture\r\nof vulgarity, falsehood, and pretence!" said Lady Laura, shuddering\r\nas her mind recurred to the fact that Mr. Quintus Slide had\r\ncontaminated Loughton by his presence. "I am told that they hardly\r\nlet him leave the place alive."\r\n\r\nWhatever Mr. Kennedy and Lady Laura might think about Loughton\r\nand the general question of small boroughs, it was found by the\r\nGovernment, to their great cost, that Mr. Turnbull\'s clause was a\r\nreality. After two months of hard work, all questions of franchise\r\nhad been settled, rating and renting, new and newfangled, fancy\r\nfranchises and those which no one fancied, franchises for boroughs\r\nand franchises for counties, franchises single, dual, three-cornered,\r\nand four-sided,--by various clauses to which the Committee of the\r\nwhole House had agreed after some score of divisions,--the matter\r\nof the franchise had been settled. No doubt there was the House\r\nof Lords, and there might yet be shipwreck. But it was generally\r\nbelieved that the Lords would hardly look at the bill,--that they\r\nwould not even venture on an amendment. The Lords would only be too\r\nhappy to let the matter be settled by the Commons themselves. But\r\nthen, after the franchise, came redistribution. How sick of the\r\nsubject were all members of the Government, no one could tell who\r\ndid not see their weary faces. The whole House was sick, having been\r\nwhipped into various lobbies, night after night, during the heat of\r\nthe summer, for weeks past. Redistribution! Why should there be any\r\nredistribution? They had got, or would get, a beautiful franchise.\r\nCould they not see what that would do for them? Why redistribute\r\nanything? But, alas, it was too late to go back to so blessed an idea\r\nas that! Redistribution they must have. But there should be as little\r\nredistribution as possible. Men were sick of it all, and would not be\r\nexigeant. Something should be done for overgrown counties;--something\r\nfor new towns which had prospered in brick and mortar. It would\r\nbe easy to crush up a peccant borough or two,--a borough that had\r\nbeen discovered in its sin. And a few boroughs now blessed with\r\ntwo members might consent to be blessed only with one. Fifteen\r\nsmall clauses might settle the redistribution, in spite of Mr.\r\nTurnbull,--if only Mr. Daubeny would be good-natured.\r\n\r\nNeither the weather, which was very hot, nor the tedium of the\r\nsession, which had been very great, nor the anxiety of Ministers,\r\nwhich was very pressing, had any effect in impairing the energy\r\nof Mr. Turnbull. He was as instant, as oratorical, as hostile, as\r\nindignant about redistribution as he had been about the franchise. He\r\nhad been sure then, and he was sure now, that Ministers desired to\r\nburke the question, to deceive the people, to produce a bill that\r\nshould be no bill. He brought out his clause,--and made Loughton\r\nhis instance. "Would the honourable gentleman who sat lowest on\r\nthe Treasury bench,--who at this moment was in sweet confidential\r\nintercourse with the right honourable gentleman now President of the\r\nBoard of Trade, who had once been a friend of the people,--would the\r\nyoung Lord of the Treasury get up in his place and tell them that\r\nno peer of Parliament had at present a voice in sending a member to\r\ntheir House of Commons,--that no peer would have a voice if this\r\nbill, as proposed by the Government, were passed in its present\r\nuseless, ineffectual, conservative, and most dishonest form?"\r\n\r\nPhineas, who replied to this, and who told Mr. Turnbull that he\r\nhimself could not answer for any peers,--but that he thought it\r\nprobable that most peers would, by their opinions, somewhat influence\r\nthe opinions of some electors,--was thought to have got out of his\r\ndifficulty very well. But there was the clause of Mr. Turnbull to be\r\ndealt with,--a clause directly disfranchising seven single-winged\r\nboroughs, of which Loughton was of course one,--a clause to which the\r\nGovernment must either submit or object. Submission would be certain\r\ndefeat in one way, and objection would be as certain defeat in\r\nanother,--if the gentlemen on the other side were not disposed to\r\nassist the ministers. It was said that the Cabinet was divided.\r\nMr. Gresham and Mr. Monk were for letting the seven boroughs go.\r\nMr. Mildmay could not bring himself to obey Mr. Turnbull, and Mr.\r\nPalliser supported him. When Mr. Mildmay was told that Mr. Daubeny\r\nwould certainly go into the same lobby with Mr. Turnbull respecting\r\nthe seven boroughs, he was reported to have said that in that case\r\nMr. Daubeny must be prepared with a Government. Mr. Daubeny made a\r\nbeautiful speech about the seven boroughs;--the seven sins, and seven\r\nstars, and seven churches, and seven lamps. He would make no party\r\nquestion of this. Gentlemen who usually acted with him would vote\r\nas their own sense of right or wrong directed them;--from which\r\nexpression of a special sanction it was considered that these\r\ngentlemen were not accustomed to exercise the privilege now accorded\r\nto them. But in regarding the question as one of right and wrong, and\r\nin looking at what he believed to be both the wish of the country and\r\nits interests, he, Mr. Daubeny,--he, himself, being simply a humble\r\nmember of that House,--must support the clause of the honourable\r\ngentleman. Almost all those to whom had been surrendered the\r\nprivilege of using their own judgment for that occasion only, used it\r\ndiscreetly,--as their chief had used it himself,--and Mr. Turnbull\r\ncarried his clause by a majority of fifteen. It was then 3 a.m.,\r\nand Mr. Gresham, rising after the division, said that his right\r\nhonourable friend the First Lord of the Treasury was too tired\r\nto return to the House, and had requested him to state that the\r\nGovernment would declare their purpose at 6 p.m. on the following\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nPhineas, though he had made his little speech in answer to Mr.\r\nTurnbull with good-humoured flippancy, had recorded his vote in\r\nfavour of the seven boroughs with a sore heart. Much as he disliked\r\nMr. Turnbull, he knew that Mr. Turnbull was right in this. He had\r\nspoken to Mr. Monk on the subject, as it were asking Mr. Monk\'s\r\npermission to throw up his office, and vote against Mr. Mildmay. But\r\nMr. Monk was angry with him, telling him that his conscience was of\r\nthat restless, uneasy sort which is neither useful nor manly. "We\r\nall know," said Mr. Monk, "and none better than Mr. Mildmay, that\r\nwe cannot justify such a borough as Loughton by the theory of our\r\nparliamentary representation,--any more than we can justify the\r\nfact that Huntingdonshire should return as many members as the East\r\nRiding. There must be compromises, and you should trust to others who\r\nhave studied the matter more thoroughly than you, to say how far the\r\ncompromise should go at the present moment."\r\n\r\n"It is the influence of the peer, not the paucity of the electors,"\r\nsaid Phineas.\r\n\r\n"And has no peer any influence in a county? Would you disfranchise\r\nWestmoreland? Believe me, Finn, if you want to be useful, you must\r\nsubmit yourself in such matters to those with whom you act."\r\n\r\nPhineas had no answer to make, but he was not happy in his mind. And\r\nhe was the less happy, perhaps, because he was very sure that Mr.\r\nMildmay would be beaten. Mr. Low in these days harassed him sorely.\r\nMr. Low was very keen against such boroughs as Loughton, declaring\r\nthat Mr. Daubeny was quite right to join his standard to that of Mr.\r\nTurnbull on such an issue. Mr. Low was the reformer now, and Phineas\r\nfound himself obliged to fight a losing battle on behalf of an\r\nacknowledged abuse. He never went near Bunce; but, unfortunately for\r\nhim, Bunce caught him once in the street and showed him no mercy.\r\n"Slide was a little \'eavy on you in the _Banner_ the other day,--eh,\r\nMr. Finn?--too \'eavy, as I told him."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Slide can be just as heavy as he pleases, Bunce."\r\n\r\n"That\'s in course. The press is free, thank God,--as yet. But it\r\nwasn\'t any good rattling away at the Earl\'s little borough when it\'s\r\nsure to go. Of course it\'ll go, Mr. Finn."\r\n\r\n"I think it will."\r\n\r\n"The whole seven on \'em. The \'ouse couldn\'t but do it. They tell me\r\nit\'s all Mr. Mildmay\'s own work, sticking out for keeping on \'em.\r\nHe\'s very old, and so we\'ll forgive him. But he must go, Mr. Finn."\r\n\r\n"We shall know all about that soon, Bunce."\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t get another seat, Mr. Finn, I suppose we shall see you\r\nback at the Inn. I hope we may. It\'s better than being member for\r\nLoughton, Mr. Finn;--you may be sure of that." And then Mr. Bunce\r\npassed on.\r\n\r\nMr. Turnbull carried his clause, and Loughton was doomed. Loughton\r\nand the other six deadly sins were anathematized, exorcised, and\r\nfinally got rid of out of the world by the voices of the gentlemen\r\nwho had been proclaiming the beauty of such pleasant vices all their\r\nlives, and who in their hearts hated all changes that tended towards\r\npopular representation. But not the less was Mr. Mildmay beaten;\r\nand, in accordance with the promise made by his first lieutenant\r\nimmediately after the vote was taken, the Prime Minister came forward\r\non the next evening and made his statement. He had already put his\r\nresignation into the hands of Her Majesty, and Her Majesty had\r\ngraciously accepted it. He was very old, and felt that the time had\r\ncome in which it behoved him to retire into that leisure which he\r\nthought he had, perhaps, earned. He had hoped to carry this bill as\r\nthe last act of his political life; but he was too old, too stiff, as\r\nhe said, in his prejudices, to bend further than he had bent already,\r\nand he must leave the completion of the matter in other hands. Her\r\nMajesty had sent for Mr. Gresham, and Mr. Gresham had already seen\r\nHer Majesty. Mr. Gresham and his other colleagues, though they\r\ndissented from the clause which had been carried by the united\r\nefforts of gentlemen opposite to him, and of gentlemen below him on\r\nhis own side of the House, were younger men than he, and would, for\r\nthe country\'s sake,--and for the sake of Her Majesty,--endeavour\r\nto carry the bill through. There would then, of course, be a\r\ndissolution, and the future Government would, no doubt, depend on\r\nthe choice of the country. From all which it was understood that Mr.\r\nGresham was to go on with the bill to a conclusion, whatever might be\r\nthe divisions carried against him, and that a new Secretary of State\r\nfor Foreign Affairs must be chosen. Phineas understood, also, that\r\nhe had lost his seat at Loughton. For the borough of Loughton there\r\nwould never again be an election. "If I had been Mr. Mildmay, I would\r\nhave thrown the bill up altogether," Lord Brentford said afterwards;\r\n"but of course it was not for me to interfere."\r\n\r\nThe session was protracted for two months after that,--beyond the\r\ntime at which grouse should have been shot,--and by the 23rd of\r\nAugust became the law of the land. "I shall never get over it," said\r\nMr. Ratler to Mr. Finn, seated one terribly hot evening on a bench\r\nbehind the Cabinet Ministers,--"never. I don\'t suppose such a session\r\nfor work was ever known before. Think what it is to have to keep\r\nmen together in August, with the thermometer at 81 degress, and the\r\nriver stinking like,--like the very mischief." Mr. Ratler, however,\r\ndid not die.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of the session Laurence Fitzgibbon resigned. Rumours\r\nreached the ears of Phineas as to the cause of this, but no certain\r\ncause was told him. It was said that Lord Cantrip had insisted upon\r\nit, Laurence having by mischance been called upon for some official\r\nstatement during an unfortunate period of absence. There was,\r\nhowever, a mystery about it;--but the mystery was not half so\r\nwonderful as the triumph to Phineas, when Mr. Gresham offered him the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n"But I shall have no seat," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"We shall none of us have seats to-morrow," said Mr. Gresham.\r\n\r\n"But I shall be at a loss to find a place to stand for."\r\n\r\n"The election will not come on till November, and you must look about\r\nyou. Both Mr. Monk and Lord Brentford seem to think you will be in\r\nthe House."\r\n\r\nAnd so the bill was carried, and the session was ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII\r\n\r\n"The Duke"\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the middle of September there was assembled a large party at\r\nMatching Priory, a country mansion belonging to Mr. Plantagenet\r\nPalliser. The men had certainly been chosen in reference to their\r\npolitical feelings and position,--for there was not a guest in\r\nthe house who had voted for Mr. Turnbull\'s clause, or the wife\r\nor daughter, or sister of any one who had so voted. Indeed, in\r\nthese days politics ran so high that among politicians all social\r\ngatherings were brought together with some reference to the state\r\nof parties. Phineas was invited, and when he arrived at Matching he\r\nfound that half the Cabinet was there. Mr. Kennedy was not there, nor\r\nwas Lady Laura. Mr. Monk was there, and the Duke,--with the Duchess,\r\nand Mr. Gresham, and Lord Thrift; Mrs. Max Goesler was there also,\r\nand Mrs. Bonteen,--Mr. Bonteen being detained somewhere out of\r\nthe way; and Violet Effingham was expected in two days, and Lord\r\nChiltern at the end of the week. Lady Glencora took an opportunity\r\nof imparting this latter information to Phineas very soon after his\r\narrival; and Phineas, as he watched her eye and her mouth while she\r\nspoke, was quite sure that Lady Glencora knew the story of the duel.\r\n"I shall be delighted to see him again," said Phineas. "That is\r\nall right," said Lady Glencora. There were also there Mr. and Mrs.\r\nGrey, who were great friends of the Pallisers,--and on the very day\r\non which Phineas reached Matching, at half an hour before the time\r\nfor dressing, the Duke of Omnium arrived. Now, Mr. Palliser was the\r\nDuke\'s nephew and heir,--and the Duke of Omnium was a very great\r\nperson indeed. I hardly know why it should have been so, but the Duke\r\nof Omnium was certainly a greater man in public estimation than the\r\nother duke then present,--the Duke of St. Bungay. The Duke of St.\r\nBungay was a useful man, and had been so all his life, sitting in\r\nCabinets and serving his country, constant as any peer in the House\r\nof Lords, always ready to take on his own shoulders any troublesome\r\nwork required of him, than whom Mr. Mildmay, and Mr. Mildmay\'s\r\npredecessor at the head of the liberal party, had had no more devoted\r\nadherent. But the Duke of Omnium had never yet done a day\'s work on\r\nbehalf of his country. They both wore the Garter, the Duke of St.\r\nBungay having earned it by service, the Duke of Omnium having been\r\ndecorated with the blue ribbon,--because he was Duke of Omnium. The\r\none was a moral, good man, a good husband, a good father, and a good\r\nfriend. The other,--did not bear quite so high a reputation. But men\r\nand women thought but little of the Duke of St. Bungay, while the\r\nother duke was regarded with an almost reverential awe. I think the\r\nsecret lay in the simple fact that the Duke of Omnium had not been\r\ncommon in the eyes of the people. He had contrived to envelope\r\nhimself in something of the ancient mystery of wealth and rank.\r\nWithin three minutes of the Duke\'s arrival Mrs. Bonteen, with an air\r\nof great importance, whispered a word to Phineas. "He has come. He\r\narrived exactly at seven!"\r\n\r\n"Who has come?" Phineas asked.\r\n\r\n"The Duke of Omnium!" she said, almost reprimanding him by her tone\r\nof voice for his indifference. "There has been a great doubt whether\r\nor no he would show himself at last. Lady Glencora told me that he\r\nnever will pledge himself. I am so glad he has come."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I ever saw him," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I have seen him,--a magnificent-looking man! I think it is so\r\nvery nice of Lady Glencora getting him to meet us. It is very rarely\r\nthat he will join in a great party, but they say Lady Glencora can do\r\nanything with him since the heir was born. I suppose you have heard\r\nall about that."\r\n\r\n"No," said Phineas; "I have heard nothing of the heir, but I know\r\nthat there are three or four babies."\r\n\r\n"There was no heir, you know, for a year and a half, and they were\r\nall au desespoir; and the Duke was very nearly quarrelling with his\r\nnephew; and Mr. Palliser--; you know it had very nearly come to a\r\nseparation."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything at all about it," said Phineas, who was not\r\nvery fond of the lady who was giving him the information.\r\n\r\n"It is so, I can assure you; but since the boy was born Lady Glencora\r\ncan do anything with the Duke. She made him go to Ascot last spring,\r\nand he presented her with the favourite for one of the races on the\r\nvery morning the horse ran. They say he gave three thousand pounds\r\nfor him."\r\n\r\n"And did Lady Glencora win?"\r\n\r\n"No;--the horse lost; and Mr. Palliser has never known what to do\r\nwith him since. But it was very pretty of the Duke;--was it not?"\r\n\r\nPhineas, though he had intended to show to Mrs. Bonteen how little he\r\nthought about the Duke of Omnium,--how small was his respect for a\r\ngreat peer who took no part in politics,--could not protect himself\r\nfrom a certain feeling of anxiety as to the aspect and gait and words\r\nof the man of whom people thought so much, of whom he had heard so\r\noften, and of whom he had seen so little. He told himself that the\r\nDuke of Omnium should be no more to him than any other man, but yet\r\nthe Duke of Omnium was more to him than other men. When he came\r\ndown into the drawing-room he was angry with himself, and stood\r\napart;--and was then angry with himself again because he stood apart.\r\nWhy should he make a difference in his own bearing because there was\r\nsuch a man in the company? And yet he could not avoid it. When he\r\nentered the room the Duke was standing in a large bow-window, and two\r\nor three ladies and two or three men were standing round him. Phineas\r\nwould not go near the group, telling himself that he would not\r\napproach a man so grand as was the Duke of Omnium. He saw Madame Max\r\nGoesler among the party, and after a while he saw her retreat. As she\r\nretreated, Phineas knew that some words from Madame Max Goesler had\r\nnot been received with the graciousness which she had expected. There\r\nwas the prettiest smile in the world on the lady\'s face, and she\r\ntook a corner on a sofa with an air of perfect satisfaction. But yet\r\nPhineas knew that she had received a wound.\r\n\r\n"I called twice on you in London," said Phineas, coming up close to\r\nher, "but was not fortunate enough to find you!"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--but you came so late in the season as to make it impossible\r\nthat there should be any arrangements for our meeting. What can any\r\nwoman do when a gentleman calls on her in August?"\r\n\r\n"I came in July."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you did; on the 31st. I keep the most accurate record of all\r\nsuch things, Mr. Finn. But let us hope that we may have better luck\r\nnext year. In the meantime, we can only enjoy the good things that\r\nare going."\r\n\r\n"Socially, or politically, Madame Goesler?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, socially. How can I mean anything else when the Duke of Omnium\r\nis here? I feel so much taller at being in the same house with him.\r\nDo not you? But you are a spoilt child of fortune, and perhaps you\r\nhave met him before."\r\n\r\n"I think I once saw the back of a hat in the park, and somebody told\r\nme that the Duke\'s head was inside it."\r\n\r\n"And you have never seen him but that once?"\r\n\r\n"Never but that once,--till now."\r\n\r\n"And do not you feel elated?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I do. For what do you take me, Madame Goesler?"\r\n\r\n"I do,--immensely. I believe him to be a fool, and I never heard of\r\nhis doing a kind act to anybody in my life."\r\n\r\n"Not when he gave the racehorse to Lady Glencora?"\r\n\r\n"I wonder whether that was true. Did you ever hear of such an\r\nabsurdity? As I was saying, I don\'t think he ever did anything\r\nfor anybody;--but then, you know, to be Duke of Omnium! It isn\'t\r\nnecessary,--is it,--that a Duke of Omnium should do anything except\r\nbe Duke of Omnium?"\r\n\r\nAt this moment Lady Glencora came up to Phineas, and took him across\r\nto the Duke. The Duke had expressed a desire to be introduced to him.\r\nPhineas, half-pleased and half-disgusted, had no alternative, and\r\nfollowed Lady Glencora. The Duke shook hands with him, and made a\r\nlittle bow, and said something about the garrotters, which Phineas,\r\nin his confusion, did not quite understand. He tried to reply as he\r\nwould have replied to anybody else, but the weight of the Duke\'s\r\nmajesty was too much for him, and he bungled. The Duke made another\r\nlittle bow, and in a moment was speaking a word of condescension\r\nto some other favoured individual. Phineas retreated altogether\r\ndisgusted,--hating the Duke, but hating himself worse; but he would\r\nnot retreat in the direction of Madame Max Goesler. It might suit\r\nthat lady to take an instant little revenge for her discomfiture, but\r\nit did not suit him to do so. The question with him would be, whether\r\nin some future part of his career it might not be his duty to assist\r\nin putting down Dukes of Omnium.\r\n\r\nAt dinner Phineas sat between Mrs. Bonteen and the Duchess of St.\r\nBungay, and did not find himself very happy. At the other end of the\r\ntable the Duke,--the great Duke, was seated at Lady Glencora\'s right\r\nhand, and on his other side Fortune had placed Madame Max Goesler.\r\nThe greatest interest which Phineas had during the dinner was in\r\nwatching the operations,--the triumphantly successful operations of\r\nthat lady. Before dinner she had been wounded by the Duke. The Duke\r\nhad not condescended to accord the honour of his little bow of\r\ngraciousness to some little flattering morsel of wit which the lady\r\nhad uttered on his behoof. She had said a sharp word or two in her\r\nmomentary anger to Phineas; but when Fortune was so good to her in\r\nthat matter of her place at dinner, she was not fool enough to throw\r\naway her chance. Throughout the soup and fish she was very quiet.\r\nShe said a word or two after her first glass of champagne. The Duke\r\nrefused two dishes, one after another, and then she glided into\r\nconversation. By the time that he had his roast mutton before him she\r\nwas in full play, and as she eat her peach, the Duke was bending over\r\nher with his most gracious smile.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you think the session was very long, Mr. Finn?" said the\r\nDuchess to Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Very long indeed, Duchess," said Phineas, with his attention still\r\nfixed on Madame Max Goesler.\r\n\r\n"The Duke found it very troublesome."\r\n\r\n"I daresay he did," said Phineas. That duke and that duchess were no\r\nmore than any other man and any other man\'s wife. The session had\r\nnot been longer to the Duke of St. Bungay than to all the public\r\nservants. Phineas had the greatest possible respect for the Duke of\r\nSt. Bungay, but he could not take much interest in the wailings of\r\nthe Duchess on her husband\'s behalf.\r\n\r\n"And things do seem to be so very uncomfortable now," said the\r\nDuchess,--thinking partly of the resignation of Mr. Mildmay, and\r\npartly of the fact that her own old peculiar maid who had lived with\r\nher for thirty years had retired into private life.\r\n\r\n"Not so very bad, Duchess, I hope," said Phineas, observing that at\r\nthis moment Madame Max Goesler\'s eyes were brilliant with triumph.\r\nThen there came upon him a sudden ambition,--that he would like to\r\n"cut out" the Duke of Omnium in the estimation of Madame Max Goesler.\r\nThe brightness of Madame Max Goesler\'s eyes had not been thrown away\r\nupon our hero.\r\n\r\nViolet Effingham came at the appointed time, and, to the surprise of\r\nPhineas, was brought to Matching by Lord Brentford. Phineas at first\r\nthought that it was intended that the Earl and his son should meet\r\nand make up their quarrel at Mr. Palliser\'s house. But Lord Brentford\r\nstayed only one night, and Phineas on the next morning heard the\r\nwhole history of his coming and going from Violet. "I have almost\r\nbeen on my knees to him to stay," she said. "Indeed, I did go on my\r\nknees,--actually on my knees."\r\n\r\n"And what did he say?"\r\n\r\n"He put his arm round me and kissed me, and,--and,--I cannot tell you\r\nall that he said. But it ended in this,--that if Chiltern can be made\r\nto go to Saulsby, fatted calves without stint will be killed. I shall\r\ndo all I can to make him go; and so must you, Mr. Finn. Of course\r\nthat silly affair in foreign parts is not to make any difference\r\nbetween you two."\r\n\r\nPhineas smiled, and said he would do his best, and looked up into her\r\nface, and was just able to talk to her as though things were going\r\ncomfortably with him. But his heart was very cold. As Violet had\r\nspoken to him about Lord Chiltern there had come upon him, for the\r\nfirst time,--for the first time since he had known that Lord Chiltern\r\nhad been refused,--an idea, a doubt, whether even yet Violet might\r\nnot become Lord Chiltern\'s wife. His heart was very sad, but he\r\nstruggled on,--declaring that it was incumbent on them both to bring\r\ntogether the father and son.\r\n\r\n"I am so glad to hear you say so, Mr. Finn," said Violet. "I really\r\ndo believe that you can do more towards it than any one else. Lord\r\nChiltern would think nothing of my advice,--would hardly speak to me\r\non such a subject. But he respects you as well as likes you, and not\r\nthe less because of what has occurred."\r\n\r\nHow was it that Violet should know aught of the respect or liking\r\nfelt by this rejected suitor for that other suitor,--who had also\r\nbeen rejected? And how was it that she was thus able to talk of one\r\nof them to the other, as though neither of them had ever come forward\r\nwith such a suit? Phineas felt his position to be so strange as to be\r\nalmost burdensome. He had told Violet, when she had refused him, very\r\nplainly, that he should come again to her, and ask once more for the\r\ngreat gift which he coveted. But he could not ask again now. In the\r\nfirst place, there was that in her manner which made him sure that\r\nwere he to do so, he would ask in vain; and then he felt that she was\r\nplacing a special confidence in him, against which he would commit a\r\nsin were he to use her present intimacy with him for the purposes of\r\nmaking love. They two were to put their shoulders together to help\r\nLord Chiltern, and while doing so he could not continue a suit which\r\nwould be felt by both of them to be hostile to Lord Chiltern. There\r\nmight be opportunity for a chance word, and if so the chance word\r\nshould be spoken; but he could not make a deliberate attack, such as\r\nhe had made in Portman Square. Violet also probably understood that\r\nshe had not now been caught in a mousetrap.\r\n\r\nThe Duke was to spend four days at Matching, and on the third\r\nday,--the day before Lord Chiltern was expected,--he was to be seen\r\nriding with Madame Max Goesler by his side. Madame Max Goesler was\r\nknown as a perfect horsewoman,--one indeed who was rather fond of\r\ngoing a little fast on horseback, and who rode well to hounds. But\r\nthe Duke seldom moved out of a walk, and on this occasion Madame Max\r\nwas as steady in her seat and almost as slow as the mounted ghost\r\nin _Don Juan_. But it was said by some there, especially by Mrs.\r\nBonteen, that the conversation between them was not slow. And on the\r\nnext morning the Duke and Madame Max Goesler were together again\r\nbefore luncheon, standing on a terrace at the back of the house,\r\nlooking down on a party who were playing croquet on the lawn.\r\n\r\n"Do you never play?" said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;--one does everything a little."\r\n\r\n"I am sure you would play well. Why do you not play now?"\r\n\r\n"No;--I shall not play now."\r\n\r\n"I should like to see you with your mallet."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry your Grace cannot be gratified. I have played croquet\r\ntill I am tired of it, and have come to think it is only fit for\r\nboys and girls. The great thing is to give them opportunities for\r\nflirting, and it does that."\r\n\r\n"And do you never flirt, Madame Goesler?"\r\n\r\n"Never at croquet, Duke."\r\n\r\n"And what with you is the choicest time?"\r\n\r\n"That depends on so many things,--and so much on the chosen person.\r\nWhat do you recommend?"\r\n\r\n"Ah,--I am so ignorant. I can recommend nothing."\r\n\r\n"What do you say to a mountain-top at dawn on a summer day?" asked\r\nMadame Max Goesler.\r\n\r\n"You make me shiver," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"Or a boat on a lake on a summer evening, or a good lead after hounds\r\nwith nobody else within three fields, or the bottom of a salt-mine,\r\nor the deck of an ocean steamer, or a military hospital in time of\r\nwar, or a railway journey from Paris to Marseilles?"\r\n\r\n"Madame Max Goesler, you have the most uncomfortable ideas."\r\n\r\n"I have no doubt your Grace has tried each of them,--successfully.\r\nBut perhaps, after all, a comfortable chair over a good fire, in a\r\npretty room, beats everything."\r\n\r\n"I think it does,--certainly," said the Duke. Then he whispered\r\nsomething at which Madame Max Goesler blushed and smiled, and\r\nimmediately after that she followed those who had already gone in\r\nto lunch.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bonteen had been hovering round the spot on the terrace on which\r\nthe Duke and Madame Max Goesler had been standing, looking on with\r\nenvious eyes, meditating some attack, some interruption, some excuse\r\nfor an interpolation, but her courage had failed her and she had\r\nnot dared to approach. The Duke had known nothing of the hovering\r\npropinquity of Mrs. Bonteen, but Madame Goesler had seen and had\r\nunderstood it all.\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs. Bonteen," she said afterwards, "why did you not come and\r\njoin us? The Duke was so pleasant."\r\n\r\n"Two is company, and three is none," said Mrs. Bonteen, who in her\r\nanger was hardly able to choose her words quite as well as she might\r\nhave done had she been more cool.\r\n\r\n"Our friend Madame Max has made quite a new conquest," said Mrs.\r\nBonteen to Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"I am so pleased," said Lady Glencora, with apparently unaffected\r\ndelight. "It is such a great thing to get anybody to amuse my uncle.\r\nYou see everybody cannot talk to him, and he will not talk to\r\neverybody."\r\n\r\n"He talked enough to her in all conscience," said Mrs. Bonteen, who\r\nwas now more angry than ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX\r\n\r\nThe Duellists Meet\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Chiltern arrived, and Phineas was a little nervous as to their\r\nmeeting. He came back from shooting on the day in question, and was\r\ntold by the servant that Lord Chiltern was in the house. Phineas went\r\ninto the billiard-room in his knickerbockers, thinking probably that\r\nhe might be there, and then into the drawing-room, and at last into\r\nthe library,--but Lord Chiltern was not to be found. At last he came\r\nacross Violet.\r\n\r\n"Have you seen him?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--he was with me half an hour since, walking round the gardens."\r\n\r\n"And how is he? Come;--tell me something about him."\r\n\r\n"I never knew him to be more pleasant. He would give no promise about\r\nSaulsby, but he did not say that he would not go."\r\n\r\n"Does he know that I am here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I told him so. I told him how much pleasure I should have in\r\nseeing you two together,--as friends."\r\n\r\n"And what did he say?"\r\n\r\n"He laughed, and said you were the best fellow in the world. You see\r\nI am obliged to be explicit."\r\n\r\n"But why did he laugh?" Phineas asked.\r\n\r\n"He did not tell me, but I suppose it was because he was thinking of\r\na little trip he once took to Belgium, and he perceived that I knew\r\nall about it."\r\n\r\n"I wonder who told you. But never mind. I do not mean to ask any\r\nquestions. As I do not like that our first meeting should be before\r\nall the people in the drawing-room, I will go to him in his own\r\nroom."\r\n\r\n"Do, do;--that will be so nice of you."\r\n\r\nPhineas sent his card up by a servant, and in a few minutes was\r\nstanding with his hand on the lock of Lord Chiltern\'s door. The last\r\ntime he had seen this man, they had met with pistols in their hands\r\nto shoot at each other, and Lord Chiltern had in truth done his very\r\nbest to shoot his opponent. The cause of quarrel was the same between\r\nthem as ever. Phineas had not given up Violet, and had no intention\r\nof giving her up. And he had received no intimation whatever from his\r\nrival that there was to be a truce between them. Phineas had indeed\r\nwritten in friendship to Lord Chiltern, but he had received no\r\nanswer;--and nothing of certainty was to be gathered from the report\r\nwhich Violet had just made. It might well be that Lord Chiltern\r\nwould turn upon him now in his wrath, and that there would be some\r\nscene which in a strange house would be obviously objectionable.\r\nNevertheless he had resolved that even that would be better than a\r\nchance encounter among strangers in a drawing-room. So the door was\r\nopened and the two men met.\r\n\r\n"Well, old fellow," said Lord Chiltern, laughing. Then all doubt was\r\nover, and in a moment Phineas was shaking his former,--and present\r\nfriend, warmly by the hand. "So we\'ve come to be an Under-Secretary\r\nhave we?--and all that kind of thing."\r\n\r\n"I had to get into harness,--when the harness offered itself," said\r\nPhineas.\r\n\r\n"I suppose so. It\'s a deuce of a bore, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"I always liked work, you know."\r\n\r\n"I thought you liked hunting better. You used to ride as if you did.\r\nThere\'s Bonebreaker back again in the stable for you. That poor fool\r\nwho bought him could do nothing with him, and I let him have his\r\nmoney back."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why you should have done that."\r\n\r\n"Because I was the biggest fool of the two. Do you remember when that\r\nbrute got me down under the bank in the river? That was about the\r\nnearest touch I ever had. Lord bless me;--how he did squeeze me! So\r\nhere you are;--staying with the Pallisers,--one of a Government party\r\nI suppose. But what are you going to do for a seat, my friend?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk about that yet, Chiltern."\r\n\r\n"A sore subject,--isn\'t it? I think they have been quite right, you\r\nknow, to put Loughton into the melting-pot,--though I\'m sorry enough\r\nfor your sake."\r\n\r\n"Quite right," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"And yet you voted against it, old chap? But, come; I\'m not going to\r\nbe down upon you. So my father has been here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--he was here for a day or two."\r\n\r\n"Violet has just been telling me. You and he are as good friends as\r\never?"\r\n\r\n"I trust we are."\r\n\r\n"He never heard of that little affair?" And Lord Chiltern nodded his\r\nhead, intending to indicate the direction of Blankenberg.\r\n\r\n"I do not think he has yet."\r\n\r\n"So Violet tells me. Of course you know that she has heard all about\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"I have reason to suppose as much."\r\n\r\n"And so does Laura."\r\n\r\n"I told her myself," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"The deuce you did! But I daresay it was for the best. It\'s a pity\r\nyou had not proclaimed it at Charing Cross, and then nobody would\r\nhave believed a word about it. Of course my father will hear it some\r\nday."\r\n\r\n"You are going to Saulsby, I hope, Chiltern?"\r\n\r\n"That question is easier asked than answered. It is quite true that\r\nthe great difficulty has been got over. Laura has had her money. And\r\nif my father will only acknowledge that he has wronged me throughout,\r\nfrom beginning to end, I will go to Saulsby to-morrow;--and would cut\r\nyou out at Loughton the next day, only that Loughton is not Loughton\r\nany longer."\r\n\r\n"You cannot expect your father to do that."\r\n\r\n"No;--and therefore there is a difficulty. So you\'ve had that awfully\r\nponderous Duke here. How did you get on with him?"\r\n\r\n"Admirably. He condescended to do something which he called shaking\r\nhands with me."\r\n\r\n"He is the greatest old dust out," said Lord Chiltern,\r\ndisrespectfully. "Did he take any notice of Violet?"\r\n\r\n"Not that I observed."\r\n\r\n"He ought not to be allowed into the same room with her." After that\r\nthere was a short pause, and Phineas felt some hesitation in speaking\r\nof Miss Effingham to Lord Chiltern. "And how do you get on with her?"\r\nasked Lord Chiltern. Here was a question for a man to answer. The\r\nquestion was so hard to be answered, that Phineas did not at first\r\nmake any attempt to answer it. "You know exactly the ground that I\r\nstand on," continued Lord Chiltern. "She has refused me three times.\r\nHave you been more fortunate?"\r\n\r\nLord Chiltern, as he asked his question, looked full into Finn\'s face\r\nin a manner that was irresistible. His look was not one of anger nor\r\neven of pride. It was not, indeed, without a strong dash of fun. But\r\nsuch as it was it showed Phineas that Lord Chiltern intended to have\r\nan answer. "No," said he at last, "I have not been more fortunate."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you have changed your mind," said his host.\r\n\r\n"No;--I have not changed my mind," said Phineas, quickly.\r\n\r\n"How stands it then? Come;--let us be honest to each other. I told\r\nyou down at Willingford that I would quarrel with any man who\r\nattempted to cut me out with Violet Effingham. You made up your mind\r\nthat you would do so, and therefore I quarrelled with you. But we\r\ncan\'t always be fighting duels."\r\n\r\n"I hope we may not have to fight another."\r\n\r\n"No;--it would be absurd," said Lord Chiltern. "I rather think that\r\nwhat we did was absurd. But upon my life I did not see any other way\r\nout of it. However, that is over. How is it to be now?"\r\n\r\n"What am I to say in answer to that?" asked Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Just the truth. You have asked her, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I have asked her."\r\n\r\n"And she has refused you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--she has refused me."\r\n\r\n"And you mean to ask her again?"\r\n\r\n"I shall;--if I ever think that there is a chance. Indeed, Chiltern,\r\nI believe I shall whether I think that I have any chance or not."\r\n\r\n"Then we start fairly, Finn. I certainly shall do so. I believe\r\nI once told you that I never would;--but that was long before I\r\nsuspected that you would enter for the same plate. What a man says on\r\nsuch a matter when he is down in the mouth goes for nothing. Now we\r\nunderstand each other, and you had better go and dress. The bell rang\r\nnearly half an hour ago, and my fellow is hanging about outside the\r\ndoor."\r\n\r\nThe interview had in one respect been very pleasant to Phineas, and\r\nin another it had been very bitter. It was pleasant to him to know\r\nthat he and Lord Chiltern were again friends. It was a delight to\r\nhim to feel that this half-savage but high-spirited young nobleman,\r\nwho had been so anxious to fight with him and to shoot him, was\r\nnevertheless ready to own that he had behaved well. Lord Chiltern\r\nhad in fact acknowledged that though he had been anxious to blow\r\nout our hero\'s brains, he was aware all the time that our hero was\r\na good sort of fellow. Phineas understood this, and felt that it\r\nwas pleasant. But with this understanding, and accompanying this\r\npleasure, there was a conviction in his heart that the distance\r\nbetween Lord Chiltern and Violet would daily grow to be less and\r\nstill less,--and that Lord Chiltern could afford to be generous. If\r\nMiss Effingham could teach herself to be fond of Lord Chiltern, what\r\nhad he, Phineas Finn, to offer in opposition to the claims of such a\r\nsuitor?\r\n\r\nThat evening Lord Chiltern took Miss Effingham out to dinner. Phineas\r\ntold himself that this was of course so arranged by Lady Glencora,\r\nwith the express view of serving the Saulsby interest. It was almost\r\nnothing to him at the moment that Madame Max Goesler was intrusted\r\nto him. He had his ambition respecting Madame Max Goesler; but that\r\nfor the time was in abeyance. He could hardly keep his eyes off Miss\r\nEffingham. And yet, as he well knew, his observation of her must be\r\nquite useless. He knew beforehand, with absolute accuracy, the manner\r\nin which she would treat her lover. She would be kind, genial,\r\nfriendly, confidential, nay, affectionate; and yet her manner would\r\nmean nothing, would give no clue to her future decision either for or\r\nagainst Lord Chiltern. It was, as Phineas thought, a peculiarity with\r\nViolet Effingham that she could treat her rejected lovers as dear\r\nfamiliar friends immediately after her rejection of them.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Finn," said Madame Max Goesler, "your eyes and ears are\r\ntell-tales of your passion."\r\n\r\n"I hope not," said Phineas, "as I certainly do not wish that any one\r\nshould guess how strong is my regard for you."\r\n\r\n"That is prettily turned,--very prettily turned; and shows more\r\nreadiness of wit than I gave you credit for under your present\r\nsuffering. But of course we all know where your heart is. Men do not\r\nundertake perilous journeys to Belgium for nothing."\r\n\r\n"That unfortunate journey to Belgium! But, dear Madame Max, really\r\nnobody knows why I went."\r\n\r\n"You met Lord Chiltern there?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;--I met Lord Chiltern there."\r\n\r\n"And there was a duel?"\r\n\r\n"Madame Max,--you must not ask me to criminate myself!"\r\n\r\n"Of course there was, and of course it was about Miss Effingham, and\r\nof course the lady thinks herself bound to refuse both the gentlemen\r\nwho were so very wicked, and of course--"\r\n\r\n"Well,--what follows?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! if you have not wit enough to see, I do not think it can be my\r\nduty to tell you. But I wished to caution you as a friend that your\r\neyes and ears should be more under your command."\r\n\r\n"You will go to Saulsby?" Violet said to Lord Chiltern.\r\n\r\n"I cannot possibly tell as yet," said he, frowning.\r\n\r\n"Then I can tell you that you ought to go. I do not care a bit for\r\nyour frowns. What does the fifth commandment say?"\r\n\r\n"If you have no better arguments than the commandments, Violet--"\r\n\r\n"There can be none better. Do you mean to say that the commandments\r\nare nothing to you?"\r\n\r\n"I mean to say that I shan\'t go to Saulsby because I am told in the\r\ntwentieth chapter of Exodus to honour my father and mother,--and that\r\nI shouldn\'t believe anybody who told me that he did anything because\r\nof the commandments."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lord Chiltern!"\r\n\r\n"People are so prejudiced and so used to humbug that for the most\r\npart they do not in the least know their own motives for what they\r\ndo. I will go to Saulsby to-morrow,--for a reward."\r\n\r\n"For what reward?" said Violet, blushing.\r\n\r\n"For the only one in the world that could tempt me to do anything."\r\n\r\n"You should go for the sake of duty. I should not even care to see\r\nyou go, much as I long for it, if that feeling did not take you\r\nthere."\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that Phineas and Lord Chiltern were to leave Matching\r\ntogether. Phineas was to remain at his office all October, and in\r\nNovember the general election was to take place. What he had hitherto\r\nheard about a future seat was most vague, but he was to meet Ratler\r\nand Barrington Erle in London, and it had been understood that\r\nBarrington Erle, who was now at Saulsby, was to make some inquiry as\r\nto that group of boroughs of which Loughton at this moment formed\r\none. But as Loughton was the smallest of four boroughs, and as one of\r\nthe four had for many years had a representative of its own, Phineas\r\nfeared that no success would be found there. In his present agony\r\nhe began to think that there might be a strong plea made for a\r\nfew private seats in the House of Commons, and that the propriety\r\nof throwing Loughton into the melting-pot was, after all, open to\r\nquestion. He and Lord Chiltern were to return to London together,\r\nand Lord Chiltern, according to his present scheme, was to proceed\r\nat once to Willingford to look after the cub-hunting. Nothing that\r\neither Violet or Phineas could say to him would induce him to\r\npromise to go to Saulsby. When Phineas pressed it, he was told by\r\nLord Chiltern that he was a fool for his pains,--by which Phineas\r\nunderstood perfectly well that when Lord Chiltern did go to Saulsby,\r\nhe, Phineas, was to take that as strong evidence that everything was\r\nover for him as regarded Violet Effingham. When Violet expressed her\r\neagerness that the visit should be made, she was stopped with an\r\nassurance that she could have it done at once if she pleased. Let him\r\nonly be enabled to carry with him the tidings of his betrothal, and\r\nhe would start for his father\'s house without an hour\'s delay. But\r\nthis authority Violet would not give him. When he answered her after\r\nthis fashion she could only tell him that he was ungenerous. "At any\r\nrate I am not false," he replied on one occasion. "What I say is the\r\ntruth."\r\n\r\nThere was a very tender parting between Phineas and Madame Max\r\nGoesler. She had learned from him pretty nearly all his history, and\r\ncertainly knew more of the reality of his affairs than any of those\r\nin London who had been his most staunch friends. "Of course you\'ll\r\nget a seat," she said as he took his leave of her. "If I understand\r\nit at all, they never throw over an ally so useful as you are."\r\n\r\n"But the intention is that in this matter nobody shall any longer\r\nhave the power of throwing over, or of not throwing over, anybody."\r\n\r\n"That is all very well, my friend; but cakes will still be hot in the\r\nmouth, even though Mr. Daubeny turn purist, with Mr. Turnbull to help\r\nhim. If you want any assistance in finding a seat you will not go to\r\nthe _People\'s Banner_,--even yet."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not to the _People\'s Banner_."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t quite understand what the franchise is," continued Madame\r\nMax Goesler.\r\n\r\n"Household in boroughs," said Phineas with some energy.\r\n\r\n"Very well;--household in boroughs. I daresay that is very fine and\r\nvery liberal, though I don\'t comprehend it in the least. And you want\r\na borough. Very well. You won\'t go to the households. I don\'t think\r\nyou will;--not at first, that is."\r\n\r\n"Where shall I go then?"\r\n\r\n"Oh,--to some great patron of a borough;--or to a club;--or perhaps\r\nto some great firm. The households will know nothing about it till\r\nthey are told. Is not that it?"\r\n\r\n"The truth is, Madame Max, I do not know where I shall go. I am like\r\na child lost in a wood. And you may understand this;--if you do not\r\nsee me in Park Lane before the end of January, I shall have perished\r\nin the wood."\r\n\r\n"Then I will come and find you,--with a troop of householders. You\r\nwill come. You will be there. I do not believe in death coming\r\nwithout signs. You are full of life." As she spoke, she had hold\r\nof his hand, and there was nobody near them. They were in a little\r\nbook-room inside the library at Matching, and the door, though not\r\nlatched, was nearly closed. Phineas had flattered himself that Madame\r\nGoesler had retreated there in order that this farewell might be\r\nspoken without interruption. "And, Mr. Finn;--I wonder whether I may\r\nsay one thing," she continued.\r\n\r\n"You may say anything to me," he replied.\r\n\r\n"No,--not in this country, in this England. There are things one\r\nmay not say here,--that are tabooed by a sort of consent,--and that\r\nwithout any reason." She paused again, and Phineas was at a loss to\r\nthink what was the subject on which she was about to speak. Could she\r\nmean--? No; she could not mean to give him any outward plain-spoken\r\nsign that she was attached to him. It was the peculiar merit of this\r\nman that he was not vain, though much was done to him to fill him\r\nwith vanity; and as the idea crossed his brain, he hated himself\r\nbecause it had been there.\r\n\r\n"To me you may say anything, Madame Goesler," he said,--"here in\r\nEngland, as plainly as though we were in Vienna."\r\n\r\n"But I cannot say it in English," she said. Then in French, blushing\r\nand laughing as she spoke,--almost stammering in spite of her usual\r\nself-confidence,--she told him that accident had made her rich, full\r\nof money. Money was a drug with her. Money she knew was wanted, even\r\nfor householders. Would he not understand her, and come to her, and\r\nlearn from her how faithful a woman could be?\r\n\r\nHe still was holding her by the hand, and he now raised it to\r\nhis lips and kissed it. "The offer from you," he said, "is as\r\nhigh-minded, as generous, and as honourable as its acceptance by me\r\nwould be mean-spirited, vile, and ignoble. But whether I fail or\r\nwhether I succeed, you shall see me before the winter is over."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L\r\n\r\nAgain Successful\r\n\r\n\r\nPhineas also said a word of farewell to Violet before he left\r\nMatching, but there was nothing peculiar in her little speech to him,\r\nor in his to her. "Of course we shall see each other in London. Don\'t\r\ntalk of not being in the House. Of course you will be in the House."\r\nThen Phineas had shaken his head and smiled. Where was he to find\r\na requisite number of householders prepared to return him? But as\r\nhe went up to London he told himself that the air of the House of\r\nCommons was now the very breath of his nostrils. Life to him without\r\nit would be no life. To have come within the reach of the good things\r\nof political life, to have made his mark so as to have almost insured\r\nfuture success, to have been the petted young official aspirant of\r\nthe day,--and then to sink down into the miserable platitudes of\r\nprivate life, to undergo daily attendance in law-courts without\r\na brief, to listen to men who had come to be much below him in\r\nestimation and social intercourse, to sit in a wretched chamber up\r\nthree pairs of stairs at Lincoln\'s Inn, whereas he was now at this\r\nmoment provided with a gorgeous apartment looking out into the Park\r\nfrom the Colonial Office in Downing Street, to be attended by a\r\nmongrel between a clerk and an errand boy at 17s. 6d. a week instead\r\nof by a private secretary who was the son of an earl\'s sister, and\r\nwas petted by countesses\' daughters innumerable,--all this would\r\nsurely break his heart. He could have done it, so he told himself,\r\nand could have taken glory in doing it, had not these other things\r\ncome in his way. But the other things had come. He had run the risk,\r\nand had thrown the dice. And now when the game was so nearly won,\r\nmust it be that everything should be lost at last?\r\n\r\nHe knew that nothing was to be gained by melancholy looks at his\r\nclub, or by show of wretchedness at his office. London was very\r\nempty; but the approaching elections still kept some there who\r\notherwise would have been looking after the first flush of pheasants.\r\nBarrington Erle was there, and was not long in asking Phineas what\r\nwere his views.\r\n\r\n"Ah;--that is so hard to say. Ratler told me that he would be looking\r\nabout."\r\n\r\n"Ratler is very well in the House," said Barrington, "but he is of no\r\nuse for anything beyond it. I suppose you were not brought up at the\r\nLondon University?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no," said Phineas, remembering the glories of Trinity.\r\n\r\n"Because there would have been an opening. What do you say to\r\nStratford,--the new Essex borough?"\r\n\r\n"Broadbury the brewer is there already!"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--and ready to spend any money you like to name. Let me see.\r\nLoughton is grouped with Smotherem, and Walker is a deal too strong\r\nat Smotherem to hear of any other claim. I don\'t think we could dare\r\nto propose it. There are the Chelsea hamlets, but it will take a wack\r\nof money."\r\n\r\n"I have not got a wack of money," said Phineas, laughing.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the devil of it. I think, if I were you, I should hark back\r\nupon some place in Ireland. Couldn\'t you get Laurence to give you up\r\nhis seat?"\r\n\r\n"What! Fitzgibbon?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. He has not a ghost of a chance of getting into office again.\r\nNothing on earth would induce him to look at a paper during all those\r\nweeks he was at the Colonial Office; and when Cantrip spoke to him,\r\nall he said was, \'Ah, bother!\' Cantrip did not like it, I can tell\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"But that wouldn\'t make him give up his seat."\r\n\r\n"Of course you\'d have to arrange it." By which Phineas understood\r\nBarrington Erle to mean that he, Phineas, was in some way to give to\r\nLaurence Fitzgibbon some adequate compensation for the surrender of\r\nhis position as a county member.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid that\'s out of the question," said Phineas. "If he were to\r\ngo, I should not get it."\r\n\r\n"Would you have a chance at Loughshane?"\r\n\r\n"I was thinking of trying it," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Of course you know that Morris is very ill." This Mr. Morris was\r\nthe brother of Lord Tulla, and was the sitting member of Loughshane.\r\n"Upon my word I think I should try that. I don\'t see where we\'re to\r\nput our hands on a seat in England. I don\'t indeed." Phineas, as\r\nhe listened to this, could not help thinking that Barrington Erle,\r\nthough he had certainly expressed a great deal of solicitude, was not\r\nas true a friend as he used to be. Perhaps he, Phineas, had risen too\r\nfast, and Barrington Erle was beginning to think that he might as\r\nwell be out of the way.\r\n\r\nHe wrote to his father, asking after the borough, and asking after\r\nthe health of Mr. Morris. And in his letter he told his own story\r\nvery plainly,--almost pathetically. He perhaps had been wrong to\r\nmake the attempt which he had made. He began to believe that he had\r\nbeen wrong. But at any rate he had made it so far successfully, and\r\nfailure now would be doubly bitter. He thought that the party to\r\nwhich he belonged must now remain in office. It would hardly be\r\npossible that a new election would produce a House of Commons\r\nfavourable to a conservative ministry. And with a liberal ministry\r\nhe, Phineas, would be sure of his place, and sure of an official\r\nincome,--if only he could find a seat. It was all very true, and was\r\nalmost pathetic. The old doctor, who was inclined to be proud of his\r\nson, was not unwilling to make a sacrifice. Mrs. Finn declared before\r\nher daughters that if there was a seat in all Ireland, Phineas ought\r\nto have it. And Mary Flood Jones stood by listening, and wondering\r\nwhat Phineas would do if he lost his seat. Would he come back and\r\nlive in County Clare, and be like any other girl\'s lover? Poor Mary\r\nhad come to lose her ambition, and to think that girls whose lovers\r\nstayed at home were the happiest. Nevertheless, she would have walked\r\nall the way to Lord Tulla\'s house and back again, might that have\r\navailed to get the seat for Phineas. Then there came an express over\r\nfrom Castlemorris. The doctor was wanted at once to see Mr. Morris.\r\nMr. Morris was very bad with gout in his stomach. According to the\r\nmessenger it was supposed that Mr. Morris was dying. Before Dr. Finn\r\nhad had an opportunity of answering his son\'s letter, Mr. Morris, the\r\nlate member for Loughshane, had been gathered to his fathers.\r\n\r\nDr. Finn understood enough of elections for Parliament, and of the\r\nnature of boroughs, to be aware that a candidate\'s chance of success\r\nis very much improved by being early in the field; and he was aware,\r\nalso, that the death of Mr. Morris would probably create various\r\naspirants for the honour of representing Loughshane. But he could\r\nhardly address the Earl on the subject while the dead body of the\r\nlate member was lying in the house at Castlemorris. The bill which\r\nhad passed in the late session for reforming the constitution of the\r\nHouse of Commons had not touched Ireland, a future measure having\r\nbeen promised to the Irish for their comfort; and Loughshane\r\ntherefore was, as to Lord Tulla\'s influence, the same as it had ever\r\nbeen. He had not there the plenary power which the other lord had\r\nheld in his hands in regard to Loughton;--but still the Castlemorris\r\ninterest would go a long way. It might be possible to stand against\r\nit, but it would be much more desirable that the candidate should\r\nhave it at his back. Dr. Finn was fully alive to this as he sat\r\nopposite to the old lord, saying now a word about the old lord\'s gout\r\nin his legs and arms, and then about the gout in the stomach, which\r\nhad carried away to another world the lamented late member for the\r\nborough.\r\n\r\n"Poor Jack!" said Lord Tulla, piteously. "If I\'d known it, I needn\'t\r\nhave paid over two thousand pounds for him last year;--need I,\r\ndoctor?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed," said Dr. Finn, feeling that his patient might perhaps\r\napproach the subject of the borough himself.\r\n\r\n"He never would live by any rule, you know," said the desolate\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n"Very hard to guide;--was he not, my lord?"\r\n\r\n"The very devil. Now, you see, I do do what I\'m told pretty\r\nwell,--don\'t I, doctor?"\r\n\r\n"Sometimes."\r\n\r\n"By George, I do nearly always. I don\'t know what you mean by\r\nsometimes. I\'ve been drinking brandy-and-water till I\'m sick of it,\r\nto oblige you, and you tell me about--sometimes. You doctors expect\r\na man to be a slave. Haven\'t I kept it out of my stomach?"\r\n\r\n"Thank God, yes."\r\n\r\n"It\'s all very well thanking God, but I should have gone as poor Jack\r\nhas gone, if I hadn\'t been the most careful man in the world. He was\r\ndrinking champagne ten days ago;--would do it, you know." Lord Tulla\r\ncould talk about himself and his own ailments by the hour together,\r\nand Dr. Finn, who had thought that his noble patient was approaching\r\nthe subject of the borough, was beginning again to feel that the\r\ndouble interest of the gout that was present, and the gout that had\r\npassed away, would be too absorbing. He, however, could say but\r\nlittle to direct the conversation.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Morris, you see, lived more in London than you do, and was\r\nsubject to temptation."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you call temptation. Haven\'t I the temptation of a\r\nbottle of wine under my nose every day of my life?"\r\n\r\n"No doubt you have."\r\n\r\n"And I don\'t drink it. I hardly ever take above a glass or two of\r\nbrown sherry. By George! when I think of it, I wonder at my own\r\ncourage. I do, indeed."\r\n\r\n"But a man in London, my lord--"\r\n\r\n"Why the deuce would he go to London? By-the-bye, what am I to do\r\nabout the borough now?"\r\n\r\n"Let my son stand for it, if you will, my lord."\r\n\r\n"They\'ve clean swept away Brentford\'s seat at Loughton, haven\'t they?\r\nHa, ha, ha! What a nice game for him,--to have been forced to help to\r\ndo it himself! There\'s nobody on earth I pity so much as a radical\r\npeer who is obliged to work like a nigger with a spade to shovel away\r\nthe ground from under his own feet. As for me, I don\'t care who sits\r\nfor Loughshane. I did care for poor Jack while he was alive. I don\'t\r\nthink I shall interfere any longer. I am glad it lasted Jack\'s time."\r\nLord Tulla had probably already forgotten that he himself had thrown\r\nJack over for the last session but one.\r\n\r\n"Phineas, my lord," began the father, "is now Under-Secretary of\r\nState."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ve no doubt he\'s a very fine fellow;--but you see, he\'s an\r\nout-and-out Radical."\r\n\r\n"No, my lord."\r\n\r\n"Then how can he serve with such men as Mr. Gresham and Mr. Monk?\r\nThey\'ve turned out poor old Mildmay among them, because he\'s not fast\r\nenough for them. Don\'t tell me."\r\n\r\n"My anxiety, of course, is for my boy\'s prospects. He seems to have\r\ndone so well in Parliament."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t he stand for Marylebone or Finsbury?"\r\n\r\n"The money, you know, my lord!"\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t interfere here, doctor. If he comes, and the people then\r\nchoose to return him, I shall say nothing. They may do just as they\r\nplease. They tell me Lambert St. George, of Mockrath, is going to\r\nstand. If he does, it\'s the d---- piece of impudence I ever heard\r\nof. He\'s a tenant of my own, though he has a lease for ever; and\r\nhis father never owned an acre of land in the county till his uncle\r\ndied." Then the doctor knew that, with a little management, the\r\nlord\'s interest might be secured for his son.\r\n\r\nPhineas came over and stood for the borough against Mr. Lambert\r\nSt. George, and the contest was sharp enough. The gentry of the\r\nneighbourhood could not understand why such a man as Lord Tulla\r\nshould admit a liberal candidate to succeed his brother. No one\r\ncanvassed for the young Under-Secretary with more persistent zeal\r\nthan did his father, who, when Phineas first spoke of going into\r\nParliament, had produced so many good arguments against that perilous\r\nstep. Lord Tulla\'s agent stood aloof,--desolate with grief at the\r\ndeath of the late member. At such a moment of family affliction, Lord\r\nTulla, he declared, could not think of such a matter as the borough.\r\nBut it was known that Lord Tulla was dreadfully jealous of Mr.\r\nLambert St. George, whose property in that part of the county was now\r\nnearly equal to his own, and who saw much more company at Mockrath\r\nthan was ever entertained at Castlemorris. A word from Lord\r\nTulla,--so said the Conservatives of the county,--would have put\r\nMr. St. George into the seat; but that word was not spoken, and\r\nthe Conservatives of the neighbourhood swore that Lord Tulla was a\r\nrenegade. The contest was very sharp, but our hero was returned by a\r\nmajority of seventeen votes.\r\n\r\nAgain successful! As he thought of it he remembered stories of great\r\ngenerals who were said to have chained Fortune to the wheels of their\r\nchariots, but it seemed to him that the goddess had never served\r\nany general with such staunch obedience as she had displayed in his\r\ncause. Had not everything gone well with him;--so well, as almost to\r\njustify him in expecting that even yet Violet Effingham would become\r\nhis wife? Dear, dearest Violet! If he could only achieve that, no\r\ngeneral, who ever led an army across the Alps, would be his equal\r\neither in success or in the reward of success. Then he questioned\r\nhimself as to what he would say to Miss Flood Jones on that very\r\nnight. He was to meet dear little Mary Flood Jones that evening at a\r\nneighbour\'s house. His sister Barbara had so told him in a tone of\r\nvoice which he quite understood to imply a caution. "I shall be so\r\nglad to see her," Phineas had replied.\r\n\r\n"If there ever was an angel on earth, it is Mary," said Barbara Finn.\r\n\r\n"I know that she is as good as gold," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Gold!" replied Barbara,--"gold indeed! She is more precious than\r\nrefined gold. But, Phineas, perhaps you had better not single her out\r\nfor any special attention. She has thought it wisest to meet you."\r\n\r\n"Of course," said Phineas. "Why not?"\r\n\r\n"That is all, Phineas. I have nothing more to say. Men of course are\r\ndifferent from girls."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true, Barbara, at any rate."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t laugh at me, Phineas, when I am thinking of nothing but of you\r\nand your interests, and when I am making all manner of excuses for\r\nyou because I know what must be the distractions of the world in\r\nwhich you live." Barbara made more than one attempt to renew the\r\nconversation before the evening came, but Phineas thought that he had\r\nhad enough of it. He did not like being told that excuses were made\r\nfor him. After all, what had he done? He had once kissed Mary Flood\r\nJones behind the door.\r\n\r\n"I am so glad to see you, Mary," he said, coming and taking a chair\r\nby her side. He had been specially warned not to single Mary out for\r\nhis attention, and yet there was the chair left vacant as though it\r\nwere expected that he would fall into it.\r\n\r\n"Thank you. We did not happen to meet last year, did we,--Mr. Finn?"\r\n\r\n"Do not call me Mr. Finn, Mary."\r\n\r\n"You are such a great man now!"\r\n\r\n"Not at all a great man. If you only knew what little men we\r\nunderstrappers are in London you would hardly speak to me."\r\n\r\n"But you are something--of State now;--are you not?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--yes. That\'s the name they give me. It simply means that if\r\nany member wants to badger some one in the House about the Colonies,\r\nI am the man to be badgered. But if there is any credit to be had, I\r\nam not the man who is to have it."\r\n\r\n"But it is a great thing to be in Parliament and in the Government\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\n"It is a great thing for me, Mary, to have a salary, though it may\r\nonly be for a year or two. However, I will not deny that it is\r\npleasant to have been successful."\r\n\r\n"It has been very pleasant to us, Phineas. Mamma has been so much\r\nrejoiced."\r\n\r\n"I am so sorry not to see her. She is at Floodborough, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes;--she is at home. She does not like coming out at night in\r\nwinter. I have been staying here you know for two days, but I go home\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\n"I will ride over and call on your mother." Then there was a pause in\r\nthe conversation for a moment. "Does it not seem odd, Mary, that we\r\nshould see so little of each other?"\r\n\r\n"You are so much away, of course."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--that is the reason. But still it seems almost unnatural. I\r\noften wonder when the time will come that I shall be quietly at home\r\nagain. I have to be back in my office in London this day week, and\r\nyet I have not had a single hour to myself since I have been at\r\nKillaloe. But I will certainly ride over and see your mother. You\r\nwill be at home on Wednesday I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Yes,--I shall be at home."\r\n\r\nUpon that he got up and went away, but again in the evening he found\r\nhimself near her. Perhaps there is no position more perilous to a\r\nman\'s honesty than that in which Phineas now found himself;--that,\r\nnamely, of knowing himself to be quite loved by a girl whom he almost\r\nloves himself. Of course he loved Violet Effingham; and they who talk\r\nbest of love protest that no man or woman can be in love with two\r\npersons at once. Phineas was not in love with Mary Flood Jones; but\r\nhe would have liked to take her in his arms and kiss her;--he would\r\nhave liked to gratify her by swearing that she was dearer to him than\r\nall the world; he would have liked to have an episode,--and did,\r\nat the moment, think that it might be possible to have one life in\r\nLondon and another life altogether different at Killaloe. "Dear\r\nMary," he said as he pressed her hand that night, "things will get\r\nthemselves settled at last, I suppose." He was behaving very ill to\r\nher, but he did not mean to behave ill.\r\n\r\nHe rode over to Floodborough, and saw Mrs. Flood Jones. Mrs. Flood\r\nJones, however, received him very coldly; and Mary did not appear.\r\nMary had communicated to her mother her resolutions as to her future\r\nlife. "The fact is, mamma, I love him. I cannot help it. If he ever\r\nchooses to come for me, here I am. If he does not, I will bear it as\r\nwell as I can. It may be very mean of me, but it\'s true."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI\r\n\r\nTroubles at Loughlinter\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a dull house at Loughlinter during the greater part of\r\nthis autumn. A few men went down for the grouse shooting late in the\r\nseason; but they stayed but a short time, and when they went Lady\r\nLaura was left alone with her husband. Mr. Kennedy had explained to\r\nhis wife, more than once, that though he understood the duties of\r\nhospitality and enjoyed the performance of them, he had not married\r\nwith the intention of living in a whirlwind. He was disposed to think\r\nthat the whirlwind had hitherto been too predominant, and had said so\r\nvery plainly with a good deal of marital authority. This autumn and\r\nwinter were to be devoted to the cultivation of proper relations\r\nbetween him and his wife. "Does that mean Darby and Joan?" his wife\r\nhad asked him, when the proposition was made to her. "It means mutual\r\nregard and esteem," replied Mr. Kennedy in his most solemn tone,\r\n"and I trust that such mutual regard and esteem between us may yet\r\nbe possible." When Lady Laura showed him a letter from her brother,\r\nreceived some weeks after this conversation, in which Lord Chiltern\r\nexpressed his intention of coming to Loughlinter for Christmas, he\r\nreturned the note to his wife without a word. He suspected that she\r\nhad made the arrangement without asking him, and was angry; but he\r\nwould not tell her that her brother would not be welcome at his\r\nhouse. "It is not my doing," she said, when she saw the frown on his\r\nbrow.\r\n\r\n"I said nothing about anybody\'s doing," he replied.\r\n\r\n"I will write to Oswald and bid him not come, if you wish it. Of\r\ncourse you can understand why he is coming."\r\n\r\n"Not to see me, I am sure," said Mr. Kennedy.\r\n\r\n"Nor me," replied Lady Laura. "He is coming because my friend Violet\r\nEffingham will be here."\r\n\r\n"Miss Effingham! Why was I not told of this? I knew nothing of Miss\r\nEffingham\'s coming."\r\n\r\n"Robert, it was settled in your own presence last July."\r\n\r\n"I deny it."\r\n\r\nThen Lady Laura rose up, very haughty in her gait and with something\r\nof fire in her eye, and silently left the room. Mr. Kennedy, when he\r\nfound himself alone, was very unhappy. Looking back in his mind to\r\nthe summer weeks in London, he remembered that his wife had told\r\nViolet that she was to spend her Christmas at Loughlinter, that he\r\nhimself had given a muttered assent and that Violet,--as far as he\r\ncould remember,--had made no reply. It had been one of those things\r\nwhich are so often mentioned, but not settled. He felt that he had\r\nbeen strictly right in denying that it had been "settled" in his\r\npresence;--but yet he felt that he had been wrong in contradicting\r\nhis wife so peremptorily. He was a just man, and he would apologise\r\nfor his fault; but he was an austere man, and would take back the\r\nvalue of his apology in additional austerity. He did not see his wife\r\nfor some hours after the conversation which has been narrated, but\r\nwhen he did meet her his mind was still full of the subject. "Laura",\r\nhe said, "I am sorry that I contradicted you."\r\n\r\n"I am quite used to it, Robert."\r\n\r\n"No;--you are not used to it." She smiled and bowed her head. "You\r\nwrong me by saying that you are used to it." Then he paused a moment,\r\nbut she said not a word,--only smiled and bowed her head again. "I\r\nremember," he continued, "that something was said in my presence to\r\nMiss Effingham about her coming here at Christmas. It was so slight,\r\nhowever, that it had passed out of my memory till recalled by an\r\neffort. I beg your pardon."\r\n\r\n"That is unnecessary, Robert."\r\n\r\n"It is, dear."\r\n\r\n"And do you wish that I should put her off,--or put Oswald off,--or\r\nboth? My brother never yet has seen me in your house."\r\n\r\n"And whose fault has that been?"\r\n\r\n"I have said nothing about anybody\'s fault, Robert. I merely\r\nmentioned a fact. Will you let me know whether I shall bid him stay\r\naway?"\r\n\r\n"He is welcome to come,--only I do not like assignations for\r\nlove-making."\r\n\r\n"Assignations!"\r\n\r\n"Clandestine meetings. Lady Baldock would not wish it."\r\n\r\n"Lady Baldock! Do you think that Violet would exercise any secrecy in\r\nthe matter,--or that she will not tell Lady Baldock that Oswald will\r\nbe here,--as soon as she knows it herself?"\r\n\r\n"That has nothing to do with it."\r\n\r\n"Surely, Robert, it must have much to do with it. And why should not\r\nthese two young people meet? The acknowledged wish of all the family\r\nis that they should marry each other. And in this matter, at any\r\nrate, my brother has behaved extremely well." Mr. Kennedy said\r\nnothing further at the time, and it became an understanding that\r\nViolet Effingham was to be a month at Loughlinter, staying from the\r\n20th of December to the 20th of January, and that Lord Chiltern was\r\nto come there for Christmas,--which with him would probably mean\r\nthree days.\r\n\r\nBefore Christmas came, however, there were various other sources of\r\nuneasiness at Loughlinter. There had been, as a matter of course,\r\ngreat anxiety as to the elections. With Lady Laura this anxiety had\r\nbeen very strong, and even Mr. Kennedy had been warmed with some\r\namount of fire as the announcements reached him of the successes\r\nand of the failures. The English returns came first,--and then\r\nthe Scotch, which were quite as interesting to Mr. Kennedy as the\r\nEnglish. His own seat was quite safe,--was not contested; but some\r\nneighbouring seats were sources of great solicitude. Then, when this\r\nwas over, there were the tidings from Ireland to be received; and\r\nrespecting one special borough in Ireland, Lady Laura evinced more\r\nsolicitude than her husband approved. There was much danger for the\r\ndomestic bliss of the house of Loughlinter, when things came to such\r\na pass, and such words were spoken, as the election at Loughshane\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n"He is in," said Lady Laura, opening a telegram.\r\n\r\n"Who is in?" said Mr. Kennedy, with that frown on his brow to which\r\nhis wife was now well accustomed. Though he asked the question, he\r\nknew very well who was the hero to whom the telegram referred.\r\n\r\n"Our friend Phineas Finn," said Lady Laura, speaking still with an\r\nexcited voice,--with a voice that was intended to display excitement.\r\nIf there was to be a battle on this matter, there should be a battle.\r\nShe would display all her anxiety for her young friend, and fling\r\nit in her husband\'s face if he chose to take it as an injury.\r\nWhat,--should she endure reproach from her husband because she\r\nregarded the interests of the man who had saved his life, of the man\r\nrespecting whom she had suffered so many heart-struggles, and as to\r\nwhom she had at last come to the conclusion that he should ever be\r\nregarded as a second brother, loved equally with the elder brother?\r\nShe had done her duty by her husband,--so at least she had assured\r\nherself;--and should he dare to reproach her on this subject, she\r\nwould be ready for the battle. And now the battle came. "I am glad\r\nof this," she said, with all the eagerness she could throw into her\r\nvoice. "I am, indeed,--and so ought you to be." The husband\'s brow\r\ngrew blacker and blacker, but still he said nothing. He had long\r\nbeen too proud to be jealous, and was now too proud to express his\r\njealousy,--if only he could keep the expression back. But his wife\r\nwould not leave the subject. "I am so thankful for this," she said,\r\npressing the telegram between her hands. "I was so afraid he would\r\nfail!"\r\n\r\n"You over-do your anxiety on such a subject," at last he said,\r\nspeaking very slowly.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, Robert? How can I be over-anxious? If it concerned\r\nany other dear friend that I have in the world, it would not be an\r\naffair of life and death. To him it is almost so. I would have walked\r\nfrom here to London to get him his election." And as she spoke she\r\nheld up the clenched fist of her left hand, and shook it, while she\r\nstill held the telegram in her right hand.\r\n\r\n"Laura, I must tell you that it is improper that you should speak\r\nof any man in those terms;--of any man that is a stranger to your\r\nblood."\r\n\r\n"A stranger to my blood! What has that to do with it? This man is my\r\nfriend, is your friend;--saved your life, has been my brother\'s best\r\nfriend, is loved by my father,--and is loved by me, very dearly. Tell\r\nme what you mean by improper!"\r\n\r\n"I will not have you love any man,--very dearly."\r\n\r\n"Robert!"\r\n\r\n"I tell you that I will have no such expressions from you. They are\r\nunseemly, and are used only to provoke me."\r\n\r\n"Am I to understand that I am insulted by an accusation? If so, let\r\nme beg at once that I may be allowed to go to Saulsby. I would rather\r\naccept your apology and retractation there than here."\r\n\r\n"You will not go to Saulsby, and there has been no accusation, and\r\nthere will be no apology. If you please there will be no more mention\r\nof Mr. Finn\'s name between us, for the present. If you will take my\r\nadvice you will cease to think of him extravagantly;--and I must\r\ndesire you to hold no further direct communication with him."\r\n\r\n"I have held no communication with him," said Lady Laura, advancing a\r\nstep towards him. But Mr. Kennedy simply pointed to the telegram in\r\nher hand, and left the room. Now in respect to this telegram there\r\nhad been an unfortunate mistake. I am not prepared to say that there\r\nwas any reason why Phineas himself should not have sent the news of\r\nhis success to Lady Laura; but he had not done so. The piece of paper\r\nwhich she still held crushed in her hand was in itself very innocent.\r\n"Hurrah for the Loughshanes. Finny has done the trick." Such were\r\nthe words written on the slip, and they had been sent to Lady Laura\r\nby her young cousin, the clerk in the office who acted as private\r\nsecretary to the Under-Secretary of State. Lady Laura resolved that\r\nher husband should never see those innocent but rather undignified\r\nwords. The occasion had become one of importance, and such words were\r\nunworthy of it. Besides, she would not condescend to defend herself\r\nby bringing forward a telegram as evidence in her favour. So she\r\nburned the morsel of paper.\r\n\r\nLady Laura and Mr. Kennedy did not meet again till late that evening.\r\nShe was ill, she said, and would not come down to dinner. After\r\ndinner she wrote him a note. "Dear Robert, I think you must regret\r\nwhat you said to me. If so, pray let me have a line from you to that\r\neffect. Yours affectionately, L." When the servant handed it to him,\r\nand he had read it, he smiled and thanked the girl who had brought\r\nit, and said he would see her mistress just now. Anything would be\r\nbetter than that the servants should know that there was a quarrel.\r\nBut every servant in the house had known all about it for the last\r\nthree hours. When the door was closed and he was alone, he sat\r\nfingering the note, thinking deeply how he should answer it, or\r\nwhether he would answer it at all. No; he would not answer it;--not\r\nin writing. He would give his wife no written record of his\r\nhumiliation. He had not acted wrongly. He had said nothing more than\r\nnow, upon mature consideration, he thought that the circumstances\r\ndemanded. But yet he felt that he must in some sort withdraw the\r\naccusation which he had made. If he did not withdraw it, there was no\r\nknowing what his wife might do. About ten in the evening he went up\r\nto her and made his little speech. "My dear, I have come to answer\r\nyour note."\r\n\r\n"I thought you would have written to me a line."\r\n\r\n"I have come instead, Laura. Now, if you will listen to me for one\r\nmoment, I think everything will be made smooth."\r\n\r\n"Of course I will listen," said Lady Laura, knowing very well that\r\nher husband\'s moment would be rather tedious, and resolving that she\r\nalso would have her moment afterwards.\r\n\r\n"I think you will acknowledge that if there be a difference of\r\nopinion between you and me as to any question of social intercourse,\r\nit will be better that you should consent to adopt my opinion."\r\n\r\n"You have the law on your side."\r\n\r\n"I am not speaking of the law."\r\n\r\n"Well;--go on, Robert. I will not interrupt you if I can help it."\r\n\r\n"I am not speaking of the law. I am speaking simply of convenience,\r\nand of that which you must feel to be right. If I wish that your\r\nintercourse with any person should be of such or such a nature it\r\nmust be best that you should comply with my wishes." He paused for\r\nher assent, but she neither assented nor dissented. "As far as I can\r\nunderstand the position of a man and wife in this country, there is\r\nno other way in which life can be made harmonious."\r\n\r\n"Life will not run in harmonies."\r\n\r\n"I expect that ours shall be made to do so, Laura. I need hardly say\r\nto you that I intend to accuse you of no impropriety of feeling in\r\nreference to this young man."\r\n\r\n"No, Robert; you need hardly say that. Indeed, to speak my own mind,\r\nI think that you need hardly have alluded to it. I might go further,\r\nand say that such an allusion is in itself an insult,--an insult now\r\nrepeated after hours of deliberation,--an insult which I will not\r\nendure to have repeated again. If you say another word in any way\r\nsuggesting the possibility of improper relations between me and Mr.\r\nFinn, either as to deeds or thoughts, as God is above me, I will\r\nwrite to both my father and my brother, and desire them to take me\r\nfrom your house. If you wish me to remain here, you had better be\r\ncareful!" As she was making this speech, her temper seemed to rise,\r\nand to become hot, and then hotter, till it glowed with a red heat.\r\nShe had been cool till the word insult, used by herself, had conveyed\r\nback to her a strong impression of her own wrong,--or perhaps I\r\nshould rather say a strong feeling of the necessity of becoming\r\nindignant. She was standing as she spoke, and the fire flashed from\r\nher eyes, and he quailed before her. The threat which she had held\r\nout to him was very dreadful to him. He was a man terribly in fear\r\nof the world\'s good opinion, who lacked the courage to go through a\r\ngreat and harassing trial in order that something better might come\r\nafterwards. His married life had been unhappy. His wife had not\r\nsubmitted either to his will or to his ways. He had that great desire\r\nto enjoy his full rights, so strong in the minds of weak, ambitious\r\nmen, and he had told himself that a wife\'s obedience was one of those\r\nrights which he could not abandon without injury to his self-esteem.\r\nHe had thought about the matter, slowly, as was his wont, and had\r\nresolved that he would assert himself. He had asserted himself, and\r\nhis wife told him to his face that she would go away and leave him.\r\nHe could detain her legally, but he could not do even that without\r\nthe fact of such forcible detention being known to all the world.\r\nHow was he to answer her now at this moment, so that she might not\r\nwrite to her father, and so that his self-assertion might still be\r\nmaintained?\r\n\r\n"Passion, Laura, can never be right."\r\n\r\n"Would you have a woman submit to insult without passion? I at any\r\nrate am not such a woman." Then there was a pause for a moment. "If\r\nyou have nothing else to say to me, you had better leave me. I am far\r\nfrom well, and my head is throbbing."\r\n\r\nHe came up and took her hand, but she snatched it away from him.\r\n"Laura," he said, "do not let us quarrel."\r\n\r\n"I certainly shall quarrel if such insinuations are repeated."\r\n\r\n"I made no insinuation."\r\n\r\n"Do not repeat them. That is all."\r\n\r\nHe was cowed and left her, having first attempted to get out of the\r\ndifficulty of his position by making much of her alleged illness, and\r\nby offering to send for Dr. Macnuthrie. She positively refused to see\r\nDr. Macnuthrie, and at last succeeded in inducing him to quit the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThis had occurred about the end of November, and on the 20th of\r\nDecember Violet Effingham reached Loughlinter. Life in Mr. Kennedy\'s\r\nhouse had gone quietly during the intervening three weeks, but not\r\nvery pleasantly. The name of Phineas Finn had not been mentioned.\r\nLady Laura had triumphed; but she had no desire to acerbate her\r\nhusband by any unpalatable allusion to her victory. And he was quite\r\nwilling to let the subject die away, if only it would die. On some\r\nother matters he continued to assert himself, taking his wife to\r\nchurch twice every Sunday, using longer family prayers than she\r\napproved, reading an additional sermon himself every Sunday evening,\r\ncalling upon her for weekly attention to elaborate household\r\naccounts, asking for her personal assistance in much local visiting,\r\ninitiating her into his favourite methods of family life in the\r\ncountry, till sometimes she almost longed to talk again about Phineas\r\nFinn, so that there might be a rupture, and she might escape. But her\r\nhusband asserted himself within bounds, and she submitted, longing\r\nfor the coming of Violet Effingham. She could not write to her father\r\nand beg to be taken away, because her husband would read a sermon to\r\nher on Sunday evening.\r\n\r\nTo Violet, very shortly after her arrival, she told her whole story.\r\n"This is terrible," said Violet. "This makes me feel that I never\r\nwill be married."\r\n\r\n"And yet what can a woman become if she remain single? The curse is\r\nto be a woman at all."\r\n\r\n"I have always felt so proud of the privileges of my sex," said\r\nViolet.\r\n\r\n"I never have found them," said the other; "never. I have tried to\r\nmake the best of its weaknesses, and this is what I have come to! I\r\nsuppose I ought to have loved some man."\r\n\r\n"And did you never love any man?"\r\n\r\n"No;--I think I never did,--not as people mean when they speak of\r\nlove. I have felt that I would consent to be cut in little pieces for\r\nmy brother,--because of my regard for him."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that is nothing."\r\n\r\n"And I have felt something of the same thing for another,--a longing\r\nfor his welfare, a delight to hear him praised, a charm in his\r\npresence,--so strong a feeling for his interest, that were he to go\r\nto wrack and ruin, I too, should, after a fashion, be wracked and\r\nruined. But it has not been love either."\r\n\r\n"Do I know whom you mean? May I name him? It is Phineas Finn."\r\n\r\n"Of course it is Phineas Finn."\r\n\r\n"Did he ever ask you,--to love him?"\r\n\r\n"I feared he would do so, and therefore accepted Mr. Kennedy\'s offer\r\nalmost at the first word."\r\n\r\n"I do not quite understand your reasoning, Laura."\r\n\r\n"I understand it. I could have refused him nothing in my power to\r\ngive him, but I did not wish to be his wife."\r\n\r\n"And he never asked you?"\r\n\r\nLady Laura paused a moment, thinking what reply she should make;--and\r\nthen she told a fib. "No; he never asked me." But Violet did not\r\nbelieve the fib. Violet was quite sure that Phineas had asked Lady\r\nLaura Standish to be his wife. "As far as I can see," said Violet,\r\n"Madame Max Goesler is his present passion."\r\n\r\n"I do not believe it in the least," said Lady Laura, firing up.\r\n\r\n"It does not much matter," said Violet.\r\n\r\n"It would matter very much. You know, you,--you; you know whom he\r\nloves. And I do believe that sooner or later you will be his wife."\r\n\r\n"Never."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you will. Had you not loved him you would never have\r\ncondescended to accuse him about that woman."\r\n\r\n"I have not accused him. Why should he not marry Madame Max Goesler?\r\nIt would be just the thing for him. She is very rich."\r\n\r\n"Never. You will be his wife."\r\n\r\n"Laura, you are the most capricious of women. You have two dear\r\nfriends, and you insist that I shall marry them both. Which shall I\r\ntake first?"\r\n\r\n"Oswald will be here in a day or two, and you can take him if you\r\nlike it. No doubt he will ask you. But I do not think you will."\r\n\r\n"No; I do not think I shall. I shall knock under to Mr. Mill, and\r\ngo in for women\'s rights, and look forward to stand for some female\r\nborough. Matrimony never seemed to me to be very charming, and\r\nupon my word it does not become more alluring by what I find at\r\nLoughlinter."\r\n\r\nIt was thus that Violet and Lady Laura discussed these matters\r\ntogether, but Violet had never showed to her friend the cards in her\r\nhand, as Lady Laura had shown those which she held. Lady Laura had\r\nin fact told almost everything that there was to tell,--had spoken\r\neither plainly with true words, or equally plainly with words that\r\nwere not true. Violet Effingham had almost come to love Phineas\r\nFinn;--but she never told her friend that it was so. At one time\r\nshe had almost made up her mind to give herself and all her wealth\r\nto this adventurer. He was a better man, she thought, than Lord\r\nChiltern; and she had come to persuade herself that it was almost\r\nimperative on her to take the one or the other. Though she could\r\ntalk about remaining unmarried, she knew that that was practically\r\nimpossible. All those around her,--those of the Baldock as well as\r\nthose of the Brentford faction,--would make such a life impossible\r\nto her. Besides, in such a case what could she do? It was all very\r\nwell to talk of disregarding the world and of setting up a house for\r\nherself;--but she was quite aware that that project could not be used\r\nfurther than for the purpose of scaring her amiable aunt. And if not\r\nthat,--then could she content herself to look forward to a joint life\r\nwith Lady Baldock and Augusta Boreham? She might, of course, oblige\r\nher aunt by taking Lord Fawn, or oblige her aunt equally by taking\r\nMr. Appledom; but she was strongly of opinion that either Lord\r\nChiltern or Phineas would be preferable to these. Thinking over it\r\nalways she had come to feel that it must be either Lord Chiltern or\r\nPhineas; but she had never whispered her thought to man or woman. On\r\nher journey to Loughlinter, where she then knew that she was to meet\r\nLord Chiltern, she endeavoured to persuade herself that it should be\r\nPhineas. But Lady Laura had marred it all by that ill-told fib. There\r\nhad been a moment before in which Violet had felt that Phineas had\r\nsacrificed something of that truth of love for which she gave him\r\ncredit to the glances of Madame Goesler\'s eyes; but she had rebuked\r\nherself for the idea, accusing herself not only of a little jealousy,\r\nbut of foolish vanity. Was he, whom she had rejected, not to speak to\r\nanother woman? Then came the blow from Lady Laura, and Violet knew\r\nthat it was a blow. This gallant lover, this young Crichton, this\r\nunassuming but ardent lover, had simply taken up with her as soon as\r\nhe had failed with her friend. Lady Laura had been most enthusiastic\r\nin her expressions of friendship. Such platonic regards might be all\r\nvery well. It was for Mr. Kennedy to look to that. But, for herself,\r\nshe felt that such expressions were hardly compatible with her ideas\r\nof having her lover all to herself. And then she again remembered\r\nMadame Goesler\'s bright blue eyes.\r\n\r\nLord Chiltern came on Christmas eve, and was received with open arms\r\nby his sister, and with that painful, irritating affection which\r\nsuch a girl as Violet can show to such a man as Lord Chiltern, when\r\nshe will not give him that other affection for which his heart is\r\npanting. The two men were civil to each other,--but very cold. They\r\ncalled each other Kennedy and Chiltern, but even that was not done\r\nwithout an effort. On the Christmas morning Mr. Kennedy asked his\r\nbrother-in-law to go to church. "It\'s a kind of thing I never do,"\r\nsaid Lord Chiltern. Mr. Kennedy gave a little start, and looked a\r\nlook of horror. Lady Laura showed that she was unhappy. Violet\r\nEffingham turned away her face, and smiled.\r\n\r\nAs they walked across the park Violet took Lord Chiltern\'s part. "He\r\nonly means that he does not go to church on Christmas day."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what he means," said Mr. Kennedy.\r\n\r\n"We need not speak of it," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"Certainly not," said Mr. Kennedy.\r\n\r\n"I have been to church with him on Sundays myself," said Violet,\r\nperhaps not reflecting that the practices of early years had little\r\nto do with the young man\'s life at present.\r\n\r\nChristmas day and the next day passed without any sign from Lord\r\nChiltern, and on the day after that he was to go away. But he was not\r\nto leave till one or two in the afternoon. Not a word had been said\r\nbetween the two women, since he had been in the house, on the subject\r\nof which both of them were thinking. Very much had been said of\r\nthe expediency of his going to Saulsby, but on this matter he had\r\ndeclined to make any promise. Sitting in Lady Laura\'s room, in the\r\npresence of both of them, he had refused to do so. "I am bad to\r\ndrive," he said, turning to Violet, "and you had better not try to\r\ndrive me."\r\n\r\n"Why should not you be driven as well as another?" she answered,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII\r\n\r\nThe First Blow\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Chiltern, though he had passed two entire days in the house with\r\nViolet without renewing his suit, had come to Loughlinter for the\r\nexpress purpose of doing so, and had his plans perfectly fixed in his\r\nown mind. After breakfast on that last morning he was up-stairs with\r\nhis sister in her own room, and immediately made his request to her.\r\n"Laura," he said, "go down like a good girl, and make Violet come up\r\nhere." She stood a moment looking at him and smiled. "And, mind," he\r\ncontinued, "you are not to come back yourself. I must have Violet\r\nalone."\r\n\r\n"But suppose Violet will not come? Young ladies do not generally wait\r\nupon young men on such occasions."\r\n\r\n"No;--but I rank her so high among young women, that I think she will\r\nhave common sense enough to teach her that, after what has passed\r\nbetween us, I have a right to ask for an interview, and that it may\r\nbe more conveniently had here than in the wilderness of the house\r\nbelow."\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the arguments used by her friend, Violet did\r\ncome. She reached the door all alone, and opened it bravely. She had\r\npromised herself, as she came along the passages, that she would not\r\npause with her hand on the lock for a moment. She had first gone to\r\nher own room, and as she left it she had looked into the glass with\r\na hurried glance, and had then rested for a moment,--thinking that\r\nsomething should be done, that her hair might be smoothed, or a\r\nribbon set straight, or the chain arranged under her brooch. A girl\r\nwould wish to look well before her lover, even when she means to\r\nrefuse him. But her pause was but for an instant, and then she went\r\non, having touched nothing. She shook her head and pressed her hands\r\ntogether, and went on quick and opened the door,--almost with a\r\nlittle start. "Violet, this is very good of you," said Lord Chiltern,\r\nstanding with his back to the fire, and not moving from the spot.\r\n\r\n"Laura has told me that you thought I would do as much as this for\r\nyou, and therefore I have done it."\r\n\r\n"Thanks, dearest. It is the old story, Violet, and I am so bad at\r\nwords!"\r\n\r\n"I must have been bad at words too, as I have not been able to make\r\nyou understand."\r\n\r\n"I think I have understood. You are always clear-spoken, and I,\r\nthough I cannot talk, am not muddle-pated. I have understood. But\r\nwhile you are single there must be yet hope;--unless, indeed, you\r\nwill tell me that you have already given yourself to another man."\r\n\r\n"I have not done that."\r\n\r\n"Then how can I not hope? Violet, I would if I could tell you all my\r\nfeelings plainly. Once, twice, thrice, I have said to myself that I\r\nwould think of you no more. I have tried to persuade myself that I am\r\nbetter single than married."\r\n\r\n"But I am not the only woman."\r\n\r\n"To me you are,--absolutely, as though there were none other on the\r\nface of God\'s earth. I live much alone; but you are always with me.\r\nShould you marry any other man, it will be the same with me still. If\r\nyou refuse me now I shall go away,--and live wildly."\r\n\r\n"Oswald, what do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I mean that I will go to some distant part of the world, where I\r\nmay be killed or live a life of adventure. But I shall do so simply\r\nin despair. It will not be that I do not know how much better and\r\ngreater should be the life at home of a man in my position."\r\n\r\n"Then do not talk of going."\r\n\r\n"I cannot stay. You will acknowledge, Violet, that I have never lied\r\nto you. I am thinking of you day and night. The more indifferent you\r\nshow yourself to me, the more I love you. Violet, try to love me." He\r\ncame up to her, and took her by both her hands, and tears were in his\r\neyes. "Say you will try to love me."\r\n\r\n"It is not that," said Violet, looking away, but still leaving her\r\nhands with him.\r\n\r\n"It is not what, dear?"\r\n\r\n"What you call,--trying."\r\n\r\n"It is that you do not wish to try?"\r\n\r\n"Oswald, you are so violent, so headstrong. I am afraid of you,--as\r\nis everybody. Why have you not written to your father, as we have\r\nasked you?"\r\n\r\n"I will write to him instantly, now, before I leave the room, and\r\nyou shall dictate the letter to him. By heavens, you shall!" He had\r\ndropped her hands when she called him violent; but now he took them\r\nagain, and still she permitted it. "I have postponed it only till I\r\nhad spoken to you once again."\r\n\r\n"No, Lord Chiltern, I will not dictate to you."\r\n\r\n"But will you love me?" She paused and looked down, having even now\r\nnot withdrawn her hands from him. But I do not think he knew how much\r\nhe had gained. "You used to love me,--a little," he said.\r\n\r\n"Indeed,--indeed, I did."\r\n\r\n"And now? Is it all changed now?"\r\n\r\n"No," she said, retreating from him.\r\n\r\n"How is it, then? Violet, speak to me honestly. Will you be my wife?"\r\nShe did not answer him, and he stood for a moment looking at her.\r\nThen he rushed at her, and, seizing her in his arms, kissed her all\r\nover,--her forehead, her lips, her cheeks, then both her hands, and\r\nthen her lips again. "By G----, she is my own!" he said. Then he went\r\nback to the rug before the fire, and stood there with his back turned\r\nto her. Violet, when she found herself thus deserted, retreated to\r\na sofa, and sat herself down. She had no negative to produce now in\r\nanswer to the violent assertion which he had pronounced as to his\r\nown success. It was true. She had doubted, and doubted,--and still\r\ndoubted. But now she must doubt no longer. Of one thing she was quite\r\nsure. She could love him. As things had now gone, she would make\r\nhim quite happy with assurances on that subject. As to that other\r\nquestion,--that fearful question, whether or not she could trust\r\nhim,--on that matter she had better at present say nothing, and\r\nthink as little, perhaps, as might be. She had taken the jump, and\r\ntherefore why should she not be gracious to him? But how was she to\r\nbe gracious to a lover who stood there with his back turned to her?\r\n\r\nAfter the interval of a minute or two he remembered himself, and\r\nturned round. Seeing her seated, he approached her, and went down on\r\nboth knees close at her feet. Then he took her hands again, for the\r\nthird time, and looked up into her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Oswald, you on your knees!" she said.\r\n\r\n"I would not bend to a princess," he said, "to ask for half her\r\nthrone; but I will kneel here all day, if you will let me, in thanks\r\nfor the gift of your love. I never kneeled to beg for it."\r\n\r\n"This is the man who cannot make speeches."\r\n\r\n"I think I could talk now by the hour, with you for a listener."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but I must talk too."\r\n\r\n"What will you say to me?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing while you are kneeling. It is not natural that you should\r\nkneel. You are like Samson with his locks shorn, or Hercules with a\r\ndistaff."\r\n\r\n"Is that better?" he said, as he got up and put his arm round her\r\nwaist.\r\n\r\n"You are in earnest?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"In earnest. I hardly thought that that would be doubted. Do you not\r\nbelieve me?"\r\n\r\n"I do believe you. And you will be good?"\r\n\r\n"Ah,--I do not know that."\r\n\r\n"Try, and I will love you so dearly. Nay, I do love you dearly. I do.\r\nI do."\r\n\r\n"Say it again."\r\n\r\n"I will say it fifty times,--till your ears are weary with it";--and\r\nshe did say it to him, after her own fashion, fifty times.\r\n\r\n"This is a great change," he said, getting up after a while and\r\nwalking about the room.\r\n\r\n"But a change for the better;--is it not, Oswald?"\r\n\r\n"So much for the better that I hardly know myself in my new joy. But,\r\nViolet, we\'ll have no delay,--will we? No shilly-shallying. What is\r\nthe use of waiting now that it\'s settled?"\r\n\r\n"None in the least, Lord Chiltern. Let us say,--this day\r\ntwelvemonth."\r\n\r\n"You are laughing at me, Violet."\r\n\r\n"Remember, sir, that the first thing you have to do is to write to\r\nyour father."\r\n\r\nHe instantly went to the writing-table and took up paper and pen.\r\n"Come along," he said. "You are to dictate it." But this she refused\r\nto do, telling him that he must write his letter to his father out of\r\nhis own head, and out of his own heart. "I cannot write it," he said,\r\nthrowing down the pen. "My blood is in such a tumult that I cannot\r\nsteady my hand."\r\n\r\n"You must not be so tumultuous, Oswald, or I shall have to live in a\r\nwhirlwind."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I shall shake down. I shall become as steady as an old stager.\r\nI\'ll go as quiet in harness by-and-by as though I had been broken\r\nto it a four-year-old. I wonder whether Laura could not write this\r\nletter."\r\n\r\n"I think you should write it yourself, Oswald."\r\n\r\n"If you bid me I will."\r\n\r\n"Bid you indeed! As if it was for me to bid you. Do you not know that\r\nin these new troubles you are undertaking you will have to bid me in\r\neverything, and that I shall be bound to do your bidding? Does it not\r\nseem to be dreadful? My wonder is that any girl can ever accept any\r\nman."\r\n\r\n"But you have accepted me now."\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed."\r\n\r\n"And you repent?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, and I will try to do your biddings;--but you must not be\r\nrough to me, and outrageous, and fierce,--will you, Oswald?"\r\n\r\n"I will not at any rate be like Kennedy is with poor Laura."\r\n\r\n"No;--that is not your nature."\r\n\r\n"I will do my best, dearest. And you may at any rate be sure of this,\r\nthat I will love you always. So much good of myself, if it be good, I\r\ncan say."\r\n\r\n"It is very good," she answered; "the best of all good words. And now\r\nI must go. And as you are leaving Loughlinter I will say good-bye.\r\nWhen am I to have the honour and felicity of beholding your lordship\r\nagain?"\r\n\r\n"Say a nice word to me before I am off, Violet."\r\n\r\n"I,--love,--you,--better,--than all the world beside; and I mean,--to\r\nbe your wife,--some day. Are not those twenty nice words?"\r\n\r\nHe would not prolong his stay at Loughlinter, though he was asked\r\nto do so both by Violet and his sister, and though, as he confessed\r\nhimself, he had no special business elsewhere. "It is no use mincing\r\nthe matter. I don\'t like Kennedy, and I don\'t like being in his\r\nhouse," he said to Violet. And then he promised that there should be\r\na party got up at Saulsby before the winter was over. His plan was\r\nto stop that night at Carlisle, and write to his father from thence.\r\n"Your blood, perhaps, won\'t be so tumultuous at Carlisle," said\r\nViolet. He shook his head and went on with his plans. He would then\r\ngo on to London and down to Willingford, and there wait for his\r\nfather\'s answer. "There is no reason why I should lose more of\r\nthe hunting than necessary." "Pray don\'t lose a day for me," said\r\nViolet. As soon as he heard from his father, he would do his father\'s\r\nbidding. "You will go to Saulsby," said Violet; "you can hunt at\r\nSaulsby, you know."\r\n\r\n"I will go to Jericho if he asks me, only you will have to go with\r\nme." "I thought we were to go to,--Belgium," said Violet.\r\n\r\n"And so that is settled at last," said Violet to Laura that night.\r\n\r\n"I hope you do not regret it."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, I am as happy as the moments are long."\r\n\r\n"My fine girl!"\r\n\r\n"I am happy because I love him. I have always loved him. You have\r\nknown that."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, no."\r\n\r\n"But I have, after my fashion. I am not tumultuous, as he calls\r\nhimself. Since he began to make eyes at me when he was nineteen--"\r\n\r\n"Fancy Oswald making eyes!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, he did, and mouths too. But from the beginning, when I was a\r\nchild, I have known that he was dangerous, and I have thought that\r\nhe would pass on and forget me after a while. And I could have lived\r\nwithout him. Nay, there have been moments when I thought I could\r\nlearn to love some one else."\r\n\r\n"Poor Phineas, for instance."\r\n\r\n"We will mention no names. Mr. Appledom, perhaps, more likely. He\r\nhas been my most constant lover, and then he would be so safe! Your\r\nbrother, Laura, is dangerous. He is like the bad ice in the parks\r\nwhere they stick up the poles. He has had a pole stuck upon him ever\r\nsince he was a boy."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--give a dog a bad name and hang him."\r\n\r\n"Remember that I do not love him a bit the less on that\r\naccount;--perhaps the better. A sense of danger does not make me\r\nunhappy, though the threatened evil may be fatal. I have entered\r\nmyself for my forlorn hope, and I mean to stick to it. Now I must go\r\nand write to his worship. Only think,--I never wrote a love-letter\r\nyet!"\r\n\r\nNothing more shall be said about Miss Effingham\'s first love-letter,\r\nwhich was, no doubt, creditable to her head and heart; but there were\r\ntwo other letters sent by the same post from Loughlinter which shall\r\nbe submitted to the reader, as they will assist the telling of the\r\nstory. One was from Lady Laura Kennedy to her friend Phineas Finn,\r\nand the other from Violet to her aunt, Lady Baldock. No letter was\r\nwritten to Lord Brentford, as it was thought desirable that he should\r\nreceive the first intimation of what had been done from his son.\r\n\r\nRespecting the letter to Phineas, which shall be first given, Lady\r\nLaura thought it right to say a word to her husband. He had been of\r\ncourse told of the engagement, and had replied that he could have\r\nwished that the arrangement could have been made elsewhere than at\r\nhis house, knowing as he did that Lady Baldock would not approve\r\nof it. To this Lady Laura had made no reply, and Mr. Kennedy had\r\ncondescended to congratulate the bride-elect. When Lady Laura\'s\r\nletter to Phineas was completed she took care to put it into the\r\nletter-box in the presence of her husband. "I have written to Mr.\r\nFinn," she said, "to tell him of this marriage."\r\n\r\n"Why was it necessary that he should be told?"\r\n\r\n"I think it was due to him,--from certain circumstances."\r\n\r\n"I wonder whether there was any truth in what everybody was saying\r\nabout their fighting a duel?" asked Mr. Kennedy. His wife made no\r\nanswer, and then he continued--"You told me of your own knowledge\r\nthat it was untrue."\r\n\r\n"Not of my own knowledge, Robert."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--of your own knowledge." Then Mr. Kennedy walked away, and was\r\ncertain that his wife had deceived him about the duel. There had\r\nbeen a duel, and she had known it; and yet she had told him that the\r\nreport was a ridiculous fabrication. He never forgot anything. He\r\nremembered at this moment the words of the falsehood, and the look\r\nof her face as she told it. He had believed her implicitly, but he\r\nwould never believe her again. He was one of those men who, in spite\r\nof their experience of the world, of their experience of their own\r\nlives, imagine that lips that have once lied can never tell the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nLady Laura\'s letter to Phineas was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n   Loughlinter, December 28th, 186--.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR FRIEND,\r\n\r\n   Violet Effingham is here, and Oswald has just left us.\r\n   It is possible that you may see him as he passes through\r\n   London. But, at any rate, I think it best to let you know\r\n   immediately that she has accepted him,--at last. If there\r\n   be any pang in this to you, be sure that I will grieve\r\n   for you. You will not wish me to say that I regret that\r\n   which was the dearest wish of my heart before I knew you.\r\n   Lately, indeed, I have been torn in two ways. You will\r\n   understand what I mean, and I believe I need say nothing\r\n   more;--except this, that it shall be among my prayers that\r\n   you may obtain all things that may tend to make you happy,\r\n   honourable, and of high esteem.\r\n\r\n   Your most sincere friend\r\n\r\n   LAURA KENNEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven though her husband should read the letter, there was nothing in\r\nthat of which she need be ashamed. But he did not read the letter.\r\nHe simply speculated as to its contents, and inquired within himself\r\nwhether it would not be for the welfare of the world in general, and\r\nfor the welfare of himself in particular, that husbands should demand\r\nto read their wives\' letters.\r\n\r\nAnd this was Violet\'s letter to her aunt:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR AUNT,\r\n\r\n   The thing has come at last, and all your troubles will be\r\n   soon over;--for I do believe that all your troubles have\r\n   come from your unfortunate niece. At last I am going to\r\n   be married, and thus take myself off your hands. Lord\r\n   Chiltern has just been here, and I have accepted him. I am\r\n   afraid you hardly think so well of Lord Chiltern as I do;\r\n   but then, perhaps, you have not known him so long. You do\r\n   know, however, that there has been some difference between\r\n   him and his father. I think I may take upon myself to say\r\n   that now, upon his engagement, this will be settled. I\r\n   have the inexpressible pleasure of feeling sure that Lord\r\n   Brentford will welcome me as his daughter-in-law. Tell the\r\n   news to Augusta with my best love. I will write to her in\r\n   a day or two. I hope my cousin Gustavus will condescend\r\n   to give me away. Of course there is nothing fixed about\r\n   time;--but I should say, perhaps, in nine years.\r\n\r\n   Your affectionate niece,\r\n\r\n   VIOLET EFFINGHAM.\r\n\r\n   Loughlinter, Friday.\r\n\r\n\r\n"What does she mean about nine years?" said Lady Baldock in her\r\nwrath.\r\n\r\n"She is joking," said the mild Augusta.\r\n\r\n"I believe she would--joke, if I were going to be buried," said Lady\r\nBaldock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII\r\n\r\nShowing How Phineas Bore the Blow\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Phineas received Lady Laura Kennedy\'s letter, he was sitting in\r\nhis gorgeous apartment in the Colonial Office. It was gorgeous in\r\ncomparison with the very dingy room at Mr. Low\'s to which he had been\r\naccustomed in his early days,--and somewhat gorgeous also as compared\r\nwith the lodgings he had so long inhabited in Mr. Bunce\'s house. The\r\nroom was large and square, and looked out from three windows on to\r\nSt. James\'s Park. There were in it two very comfortable arm-chairs\r\nand a comfortable sofa. And the office table at which he sat was of\r\nold mahogany, shining brightly, and seemed to be fitted up with every\r\npossible appliance for official comfort. This stood near one of the\r\nwindows, so that he could sit and look down upon the park. And there\r\nwas a large round table covered with books and newspapers. And the\r\nwalls of the room were bright with maps of all the colonies. And\r\nthere was one very interesting map,--but not very bright,--showing\r\nthe American colonies, as they used to be. And there was a little\r\ninner closet in which he could brush his hair and wash his hands; and\r\nin the room adjoining there sat,--or ought to have sat, for he was\r\noften absent, vexing the mind of Phineas,--the Earl\'s nephew, his\r\nprivate secretary. And it was all very gorgeous. Often as he looked\r\nround upon it, thinking of his old bedroom at Killaloe, of his little\r\ngarrets at Trinity, of the dingy chambers in Lincoln\'s Inn, he would\r\ntell himself that it was very gorgeous. He would wonder that anything\r\nso grand had fallen to his lot.\r\n\r\nThe letter from Scotland was brought to him in the afternoon, having\r\nreached London by some day-mail from Glasgow. He was sitting at his\r\ndesk with a heap of papers before him referring to a contemplated\r\nrailway from Halifax, in Nova Scotia, to the foot of the Rocky\r\nMountains. It had become his business to get up the subject, and then\r\ndiscuss with his principal, Lord Cantrip, the expediency of advising\r\nthe Government to lend a company five million of money, in order\r\nthat this railway might be made. It was a big subject, and the\r\ncontemplation of it gratified him. It required that he should look\r\nforward to great events, and exercise the wisdom of a statesman. What\r\nwas the chance of these colonies being swallowed up by those other\r\nregions,--once colonies,--of which the map that hung in the corner\r\ntold so eloquent a tale? And if so, would the five million ever be\r\nrepaid? And if not swallowed up, were the colonies worth so great an\r\nadventure of national money? Could they repay it? Would they do so?\r\nShould they be made to do so? Mr. Low, who was now a Q.C. and in\r\nParliament, would not have greater subjects than this before him,\r\neven if he should come to be Solicitor General. Lord Cantrip had\r\nspecially asked him to get up this matter,--and he was getting it up\r\nsedulously. Once in nine years the harbour of Halifax was blocked up\r\nby ice. He had just jotted down the fact, which was material, when\r\nLady Laura\'s letter was brought to him. He read it, and putting\r\nit down by his side very gently, went back to his maps as though\r\nthe thing would not so trouble his mind as to disturb his work. He\r\nabsolutely wrote, automatically, certain words of a note about the\r\nharbour, after he had received the information. A horse will gallop\r\nfor some scores of yards, after his back has been broken, before\r\nhe knows of his great ruin;--and so it was with Phineas Finn. His\r\nback was broken, but, nevertheless, he galloped, for a yard or two.\r\n"Closed in 1860-61 for thirteen days." Then he began to be aware that\r\nhis back was broken, and that the writing of any more notes about the\r\nice in Halifax harbour was for the present out of the question. "I\r\nthink it best to let you know immediately that she has accepted him."\r\nThese were the words which he read the oftenest. Then it was all\r\nover! The game was played out, and all his victories were as nothing\r\nto him. He sat for an hour in his gorgeous room thinking of it, and\r\nvarious were the answers which he gave during the time to various\r\nmessages;--but he would see nobody. As for the colonies, he did not\r\ncare if they revolted to-morrow. He would have parted with every\r\ncolony belonging to Great Britain to have gotten the hand of Violet\r\nEffingham for himself. Now,--now at this moment, he told himself with\r\noaths that he had never loved any one but Violet Effingham.\r\n\r\nThere had been so much to make such a marriage desirable! I should\r\nwrong my hero deeply were I to say that the weight of his sorrow was\r\noccasioned by the fact that he had lost an heiress. He would never\r\nhave thought of looking for Violet Effingham had he not first learned\r\nto love her. But as the idea opened itself out to him, everything\r\nhad seemed to be so suitable. Had Miss Effingham become his wife,\r\nthe mouths of the Lows and of the Bunces would have been stopped\r\naltogether. Mr. Monk would have come to his house as his familiar\r\nguest, and he would have been connected with half a score of peers.\r\nA seat in Parliament would be simply his proper place, and even\r\nUnder-Secretaryships of State might soon come to be below him. He\r\nwas playing a great game, but hitherto he had played it with so much\r\nsuccess,--with such wonderful luck! that it had seemed to him that\r\nall things were within his reach. Nothing more had been wanting to\r\nhim than Violet\'s hand for his own comfort, and Violet\'s fortune to\r\nsupport his position; and these, too, had almost seemed to be within\r\nhis grasp. His goddess had indeed refused him,--but not with disdain.\r\nEven Lady Laura had talked of his marriage as not improbable. All the\r\nworld, almost, had heard of the duel; and all the world had smiled,\r\nand seemed to think that in the real fight Phineas Finn would be\r\nthe victor,--that the lucky pistol was in his hands. It had never\r\noccurred to any one to suppose,--as far as he could see,--that he was\r\npresuming at all, or pushing himself out of his own sphere, in asking\r\nViolet Effingham to be his wife. No;--he would trust his luck, would\r\npersevere, and would succeed. Such had been his resolution on that\r\nvery morning,--and now there had come this letter to dash him to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThere were moments in which he declared to himself that he would not\r\nbelieve the letter,--not that there was any moment in which there\r\nwas in his mind the slightest spark of real hope. But he would tell\r\nhimself that he would still persevere. Violet might have been driven\r\nto accept that violent man by violent influence,--or it might be\r\nthat she had not in truth accepted him, that Chiltern had simply so\r\nasserted. Or, even if it were so, did women never change their minds?\r\nThe manly thing would be to persevere to the end. Had he not before\r\nbeen successful, when success seemed to be as far from him? But he\r\ncould buoy himself up with no real hope. Even when these ideas were\r\npresent to his mind, he knew,--he knew well,--at those very moments,\r\nthat his back was broken.\r\n\r\nSome one had come in and lighted the candles and drawn down the\r\nblinds while he was sitting there, and now, as he looked at his\r\nwatch, he found that it was past five o\'clock. He was engaged to dine\r\nwith Madame Max Goesler at eight, and in his agony he half-resolved\r\nthat he would send an excuse. Madame Max would be full of wrath, as\r\nshe was very particular about her little dinner-parties;--but, what\r\ndid he care now about the wrath of Madame Max Goesler? And yet only\r\nthis morning he had been congratulating himself, among his other\r\nsuccesses, upon her favour, and had laughed inwardly at his own\r\nfalseness,--his falseness to Violet Effingham,--as he did so. He\r\nhad said something to himself jocosely about lovers\' perjuries, the\r\nremembrance of which was now very bitter to him. He took up a sheet\r\nof note-paper and scrawled an excuse to Madame Goesler. News from the\r\ncountry, he said, made it impossible that he should go out to-night.\r\nBut he did not send the note. At about half-past five he opened the\r\ndoor of his private secretary\'s room and found the young man fast\r\nasleep, with a cigar in his mouth. "Halloa, Charles," he said.\r\n\r\n"All right!" Charles Standish was a first cousin of Lady Laura\'s,\r\nand, having been in the office before Phineas had joined it, and\r\nbeing a great favourite with his cousin, had of course become the\r\nUnder-Secretary\'s private secretary. "I\'m all here," said Charles\r\nStandish, getting up and shaking himself.\r\n\r\n"I am going. Just tie up those papers,--exactly as they are. I shall\r\nbe here early to-morrow, but I shan\'t want you before twelve. Good\r\nnight, Charles."\r\n\r\n"Ta, ta," said his private secretary, who was very fond of his\r\nmaster, but not very respectful,--unless upon express occasions.\r\n\r\nThen Phineas went out and walked across the park; but as he went he\r\nbecame quite aware that his back was broken. It was not the less\r\nbroken because he sang to himself little songs to prove to himself\r\nthat it was whole and sound. It was broken, and it seemed to him now\r\nthat he never could become an Atlas again, to bear the weight of the\r\nworld upon his shoulders. What did anything signify? All that he had\r\ndone had been part of a game which he had been playing throughout,\r\nand now he had been beaten in his game. He absolutely ignored his\r\nold passion for Lady Laura as though it had never been, and regarded\r\nhimself as a model of constancy,--as a man who had loved, not wisely\r\nperhaps, but much too well,--and who must now therefore suffer a\r\nliving death. He hated Parliament. He hated the Colonial Office.\r\nHe hated his friend Mr. Monk; and he especially hated Madame Max\r\nGoesler. As to Lord Chiltern,--he believed that Lord Chiltern had\r\nobtained his object by violence. He would see to that! Yes;--let the\r\nconsequences be what they might, he would see to that!\r\n\r\nHe went up by the Duke of York\'s column, and as he passed the\r\nAthenaeum he saw his chief, Lord Cantrip, standing under the portico\r\ntalking to a bishop. He would have gone on unnoticed, had it been\r\npossible; but Lord Cantrip came down to him at once. "I have put your\r\nname down here," said his lordship.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use?" said Phineas, who was profoundly indifferent at\r\nthis moment to all the clubs in London.\r\n\r\n"It can\'t do any harm, you know. You\'ll come up in time. And if you\r\nshould get into the ministry, they\'ll let you in at once."\r\n\r\n"Ministry!" ejaculated Phineas. But Lord Cantrip took the tone of\r\nvoice as simply suggestive of humility, and suspected nothing of that\r\nprofound indifference to all ministers and ministerial honours which\r\nPhineas had intended to express. "By-the-bye," said Lord Cantrip,\r\nputting his arm through that of the Under-Secretary, "I wanted to\r\nspeak to you about the guarantees. We shall be in the devil\'s own\r\nmess, you know--" And so the Secretary of State went on about the\r\nRocky Mountain Railroad, and Phineas strove hard to bear his burden\r\nwith his broken back. He was obliged to say something about the\r\nguarantees, and the railway, and the frozen harbour,--and something\r\nespecially about the difficulties which would be found, not in the\r\nmeasures themselves, but in the natural pugnacity of the Opposition.\r\nIn the fabrication of garments for the national wear, the great\r\nthing is to produce garments that shall, as far as possible, defy\r\nhole-picking. It may be, and sometimes is, the case, that garments\r\nso fabricated will be good also for wear. Lord Cantrip, at the\r\npresent moment, was very anxious and very ingenious in the stopping\r\nof holes; and he thought that perhaps his Under-Secretary was too\r\nmuch prone to the indulgence of large philanthropical views without\r\nsufficient thought of the hole-pickers. But on this occasion, by\r\nthe time that he reached Brooks\'s, he had been enabled to convince\r\nhis Under-Secretary, and though he had always thought well of his\r\nUnder-Secretary, he thought better of him now than ever he had done.\r\nPhineas during the whole time had been meditating what he could do\r\nto Lord Chiltern when they two should meet. Could he take him by the\r\nthroat and smite him? "I happen to know that Broderick is working as\r\nhard at the matter as we are," said Lord Cantrip, stopping opposite\r\nto the club. "He moved for papers, you know, at the end of last\r\nsession." Now Mr. Broderick was a gentleman in the House looking for\r\npromotion in a Conservative Government, and of course would oppose\r\nany measure that could be brought forward by the Cantrip-Finn\r\nColonial Administration. Then Lord Cantrip slipped into the club, and\r\nPhineas went on alone.\r\n\r\nA spark of his old ambition with reference to Brooks\'s was the first\r\nthing to make him forget his misery for a moment. He had asked Lord\r\nBrentford to put his name down, and was not sure whether it had been\r\ndone. The threat of Mr. Broderick\'s opposition had been of no use\r\ntowards the strengthening of his broken back, but the sight of Lord\r\nCantrip hurrying in at the coveted door did do something. "A man\r\ncan\'t cut his throat or blow his brains out," he said to himself;\r\n"after all, he must go on and do his work. For hearts will break, yet\r\nbrokenly live on." Thereupon he went home, and after sitting for an\r\nhour over his own fire, and looking wistfully at a little treasure\r\nwhich he had,--a treasure obtained by some slight fraud at Saulsby,\r\nand which he now chucked into the fire, and then instantly again\r\npulled out of it, soiled but unscorched,--he dressed himself for\r\ndinner, and went out to Madame Max Goesler\'s. Upon the whole, he was\r\nglad that he had not sent the note of excuse. A man must live, even\r\nthough his heart be broken, and living he must dine.\r\n\r\nMadame Max Goesler was fond of giving little dinners at this period\r\nof the year, before London was crowded, and when her guests might\r\nprobably not be called away by subsequent social arrangements. Her\r\nnumber seldom exceeded six or eight, and she always spoke of these\r\nentertainments as being of the humblest kind. She sent out no big\r\ncards. She preferred to catch her people as though by chance, when\r\nthat was possible. "Dear Mr. Jones. Mr. Smith is coming to tell\r\nme about some sherry on Tuesday. Will you come and tell me too? I\r\ndaresay you know as much about it." And then there was a studious\r\nabsence of parade. The dishes were not very numerous. The bill of\r\nfare was simply written out once, for the mistress, and so circulated\r\nround the table. Not a word about the things to be eaten or the\r\nthings to be drunk was ever spoken at the table,--or at least no such\r\nword was ever spoken by Madame Goesler. But, nevertheless, they who\r\nknew anything about dinners were aware that Madame Goesler gave very\r\ngood dinners indeed. Phineas Finn was beginning to flatter himself\r\nthat he knew something about dinners, and had been heard to assert\r\nthat the soups at the cottage in Park Lane were not to be beaten in\r\nLondon. But he cared for no soup to-day, as he slowly made his way up\r\nMadame Goesler\'s staircase.\r\n\r\nThere had been one difficulty in the way of Madame Goesler\'s\r\ndinner-parties which had required some patience and great ingenuity\r\nin its management. She must either have ladies, or she must not have\r\nthem. There was a great allurement in the latter alternative; but she\r\nknew well that if she gave way to it, all prospect of general society\r\nwould for her be closed,--and for ever. This had been in the early\r\ndays of her widowhood in Park Lane. She cared but little for women\'s\r\nsociety; but she knew well that the society of gentlemen without\r\nwomen would not be that which she desired. She knew also that she\r\nmight as effectually crush herself and all her aspirations by\r\nbringing to her house indifferent women,--women lacking something\r\neither in character, or in position, or in talent,--as by having none\r\nat all. Thus there had been a great difficulty, and sometimes she had\r\nthought that the thing could not be done at all. "These English are\r\nso stiff, so hard, so heavy!" And yet she would not have cared to\r\nsucceed elsewhere than among the English. By degrees, however, the\r\nthing was done. Her prudence equalled her wit, and even suspicious\r\npeople had come to acknowledge that they could not put their fingers\r\non anything wrong. When Lady Glencora Palliser had once dined at\r\nthe cottage in Park Lane, Madame Max Goesler had told herself that\r\nhenceforth she did not care what the suspicious people said. Since\r\nthat the Duke of Omnium had almost promised that he would come. If\r\nshe could only entertain the Duke of Omnium she would have done\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nBut there was no Duke of Omnium there to-night. At this time the Duke\r\nof Omnium was, of course, not in London. But Lord Fawn was there; and\r\nour old friend Laurence Fitzgibbon, who had--resigned his place at\r\nthe Colonial Office; and there were Mr. and Mrs. Bonteen. They, with\r\nour hero, made up the party. No one doubted for a moment to what\r\nsource Mr. Bonteen owed his dinner. Mrs. Bonteen was good-looking,\r\ncould talk, was sufficiently proper, and all that kind of thing,--and\r\ndid as well as any other woman at this time of year to keep Madame\r\nMax Goesler in countenance. There was never any sitting after dinner\r\nat the cottage; or, I should rather say, there was never any sitting\r\nafter Madame Goesler went; so that the two ladies could not weary\r\neach other by being alone together. Mrs. Bonteen understood quite\r\nwell that she was not required there to talk to her hostess, and was\r\nas willing as any woman to make herself agreeable to the gentlemen\r\nshe might meet at Madame Goesler\'s table. And thus Mr. and Mrs.\r\nBonteen not unfrequently dined in Park Lane.\r\n\r\n"Now we have only to wait for that horrible man, Mr. Fitzgibbon,"\r\nsaid Madame Max Goesler, as she welcomed Phineas. "He is always\r\nlate."\r\n\r\n"What a blow for me!" said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"No,--you are always in good time. But there is a limit beyond which\r\ngood time ends, and being shamefully late at once begins. But here he\r\nis." And then, as Laurence Fitzgibbon entered the room, Madame\r\nGoesler rang the bell for dinner.\r\n\r\nPhineas found himself placed between his hostess and Mr. Bonteen, and\r\nLord Fawn was on the other side of Madame Goesler. They were hardly\r\nseated at the table before some one stated it as a fact that Lord\r\nBrentford and his son were reconciled. Now Phineas knew, or thought\r\nthat he knew, that this could not as yet be the case; and indeed such\r\nwas not the case, though the father had already received the son\'s\r\nletter. But Phineas did not choose to say anything at present about\r\nLord Chiltern.\r\n\r\n"How odd it is," said Madame Goesler; "how often you English fathers\r\nquarrel with your sons!"\r\n\r\n"How often we English sons quarrel with our fathers rather," said\r\nLord Fawn, who was known for the respect he had always paid to the\r\nfifth commandment.\r\n\r\n"It all comes from entail and primogeniture, and old-fashioned\r\nEnglish prejudices of that kind," said Madame Goesler. "Lord Chiltern\r\nis a friend of yours, Mr. Finn, I think."\r\n\r\n"They are both friends of mine," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes; but you,--you,--you and Lord Chiltern once did something\r\nodd together. There was a little mystery, was there not?"\r\n\r\n"It is very little of a mystery now," said Fitzgibbon.\r\n\r\n"It was about a lady;--was it not?" said Mrs. Bonteen, affecting to\r\nwhisper to her neighbour.\r\n\r\n"I am not at liberty to say anything on the subject," said\r\nFitzgibbon; "but I have no doubt Phineas will tell you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe this about Lord Brentford," said Mr. Bonteen. "I\r\nhappen to know that Chiltern was down at Loughlinter three days ago,\r\nand that he passed through London yesterday on his way to the place\r\nwhere he hunts. The Earl is at Saulsby. He would have gone to Saulsby\r\nif it were true."\r\n\r\n"It all depends upon whether Miss Effingham will accept him," said\r\nMrs. Bonteen, looking over at Phineas as she spoke.\r\n\r\nAs there were two of Violet Effingham\'s suitors at table, the subject\r\nwas becoming disagreeably personal; and the more so, as every one of\r\nthe party knew or surmised something of the facts of the case. The\r\ncause of the duel at Blankenberg had become almost as public as the\r\nduel, and Lord Fawn\'s courtship had not been altogether hidden from\r\nthe public eye. He on the present occasion might probably be able to\r\ncarry himself better than Phineas, even presuming him to be equally\r\neager in his love,--for he knew nothing of the fatal truth. But he\r\nwas unable to hear Mrs. Bonteen\'s statement with indifference, and\r\nshowed his concern in the matter by his reply. "Any lady will be much\r\nto be pitied," he said, "who does that. Chiltern is the last man in\r\nthe world to whom I would wish to trust the happiness of a woman for\r\nwhom I cared."\r\n\r\n"Chiltern is a very good fellow," said Laurence Fitzgibbon.\r\n\r\n"Just a little wild," said Mrs. Bonteen.\r\n\r\n"And never had a shilling in his pocket in his life," said her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n"I regard him as simply a madman," said Lord Fawn.\r\n\r\n"I do so wish I knew him," said Madame Max Goesler. "I am fond of\r\nmadmen, and men who haven\'t shillings, and who are a little wild,\r\nCould you not bring him here, Mr. Finn?"\r\n\r\nPhineas did not know what to say, or how to open his mouth without\r\nshowing his deep concern. "I shall be happy to ask him if you wish\r\nit," he replied, as though the question had been put to him in\r\nearnest; "but I do not see so much of Lord Chiltern as I used to do."\r\n\r\n"You do not believe that Violet Effingham will accept him?" asked\r\nMrs. Bonteen.\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment before he spoke, and then made his answer in a\r\ndeep solemn voice,--with a seriousness which he was unable to\r\nrepress. "She has accepted him," he said.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that you know it?" said Madame Goesler.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I mean that I know it."\r\n\r\nHad anybody told him beforehand that he would openly make this\r\ndeclaration at Madame Goesler\'s table, he would have said that of\r\nall things it was the most impossible. He would have declared that\r\nnothing would have induced him to speak of Violet Effingham in his\r\nexisting frame of mind, and that he would have had his tongue cut\r\nout before he spoke of her as the promised bride of his rival. And\r\nnow he had declared the whole truth of his own wretchedness and\r\ndiscomfiture. He was well aware that all of them there knew why he\r\nhad fought the duel at Blankenberg;--all, that is, except perhaps\r\nLord Fawn. And he felt as he made the statement as to Lord Chiltern\r\nthat he blushed up to his forehead, and that his voice was strange,\r\nand that he was telling the tale of his own disgrace. But when the\r\ndirect question had been asked him he had been unable to refrain from\r\nanswering it directly. He had thought of turning it off with some\r\njest or affectation of drollery, but had failed. At the moment he had\r\nbeen unable not to speak the truth.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe a word of it," said Lord Fawn,--who also forgot\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n"I do believe it, if Mr. Finn says so," said Mrs. Bonteen, who rather\r\nliked the confusion she had caused.\r\n\r\n"But who could have told you, Finn?" asked Mr. Bonteen.\r\n\r\n"His sister, Lady Laura, told me so," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Then it must be true," said Madame Goesler.\r\n\r\n"It is quite impossible," said Lord Fawn. "I think I may say that\r\nI know that it is impossible. If it were so, it would be a most\r\nshameful arrangement. Every shilling she has in the world would\r\nbe swallowed up." Now, Lord Fawn in making his proposals had been\r\nmagnanimous in his offers as to settlements and pecuniary provisions\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes after that Phineas did not speak another word, and\r\nthe conversation generally was not so brisk and bright as it was\r\nexpected to be at Madame Goesler\'s. Madame Max Goesler herself\r\nthoroughly understood our hero\'s position, and felt for him. She\r\nwould have encouraged no questionings about Violet Effingham had\r\nshe thought that they would have led to such a result, and now she\r\nexerted herself to turn the minds of her guests to other subjects.\r\nAt last she succeeded; and after a while, too, Phineas himself was\r\nable to talk. He drank two or three glasses of wine, and dashed\r\naway into politics, taking the earliest opportunity in his power of\r\ncontradicting Lord Fawn very plainly on one or two matters. Laurence\r\nFitzgibbon was of course of opinion that the ministry could not stay\r\nin long. Since he had left the Government the ministers had made\r\nwonderful mistakes, and he spoke of them quite as an enemy might\r\nspeak. "And yet, Fitz," said Mr. Bonteen, "you used to be so staunch\r\na supporter."\r\n\r\n"I have seen the error of my way, I can assure you," said Laurence.\r\n\r\n"I always observe," said Madame Max Goesler, "that when any of\r\nyou gentlemen resign,--which you usually do on some very trivial\r\nmatter,--the resigning gentleman becomes of all foes the bitterest.\r\nSomebody goes on very well with his friends, agreeing most cordially\r\nabout everything, till he finds that his public virtue cannot swallow\r\nsome little detail, and then he resigns. Or some one, perhaps, on the\r\nother side has attacked him, and in the melee he is hurt, and so he\r\nresigns. But when he has resigned, and made his parting speech full\r\nof love and gratitude, I know well after that where to look for the\r\nbitterest hostility to his late friends. Yes, I am beginning to\r\nunderstand the way in which politics are done in England."\r\n\r\nAll this was rather severe upon Laurence Fitzgibbon; but he was a man\r\nof the world, and bore it better than Phineas had borne his defeat.\r\n\r\nThe dinner, taken altogether, was not a success, and so Madame\r\nGoesler understood. Lord Fawn, after he had been contradicted by\r\nPhineas, hardly opened his mouth. Phineas himself talked rather too\r\nmuch and rather too loudly; and Mrs. Bonteen, who was well enough\r\ninclined to flatter Lord Fawn, contradicted him. "I made a mistake,"\r\nsaid Madame Goesler afterwards, "in having four members of Parliament\r\nwho all of them were or had been in office. I never will have two men\r\nin office together again." This she said to Mrs. Bonteen. "My dear\r\nMadame Max," said Mrs. Bonteen, "your resolution ought to be that you\r\nwill never again have two claimants for the same young lady."\r\n\r\nIn the drawing-room up-stairs Madame Goesler managed to be alone for\r\nthree minutes with Phineas Finn. "And it is as you say, my friend?"\r\nshe asked. Her voice was plaintive and soft, and there was a look of\r\nreal sympathy in her eyes. Phineas almost felt that if they two had\r\nbeen quite alone he could have told her everything, and have wept at\r\nher feet.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, "it is so."\r\n\r\n"I never doubted it when you had declared it. May I venture to say\r\nthat I wish it had been otherwise?"\r\n\r\n"It is too late now, Madame Goesler. A man of course is a fool to\r\nshow that he has any feelings in such a matter. The fact is, I heard\r\nit just before I came here, and had made up my mind to send you an\r\nexcuse. I wish I had now."\r\n\r\n"Do not say that, Mr. Finn."\r\n\r\n"I have made such an ass of myself."\r\n\r\n"In my estimation you have done yourself honour. But if I may venture\r\nto give you counsel, do not speak of this affair again as though you\r\nhad been personally concerned in it. In the world now-a-days the only\r\nthing disgraceful is to admit a failure."\r\n\r\n"And I have failed."\r\n\r\n"But you need not admit it, Mr. Finn. I know I ought not to say as\r\nmuch to you."\r\n\r\n"I, rather, am deeply indebted to you. I will go now, Madame Goesler,\r\nas I do not wish to leave the house with Lord Fawn."\r\n\r\n"But you will come and see me soon." Then Phineas promised that he\r\nwould come soon; and felt as he made the promise that he would have\r\nan opportunity of talking over his love with his new friend at any\r\nrate without fresh shame as to his failure.\r\n\r\nLaurence Fitzgibbon went away with Phineas, and Mr. Bonteen, having\r\nsent his wife away by herself, walked off towards the clubs with Lord\r\nFawn. He was very anxious to have a few words with Lord Fawn. Lord\r\nFawn had evidently been annoyed by Phineas, and Mr. Bonteen did not\r\nat all love the young Under-Secretary. "That fellow has become the\r\nmost consummate puppy I ever met," said he, as he linked himself on\r\nto the lord, "Monk, and one or two others among them, have contrived\r\nto spoil him altogether."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe a word of what he said about Lord Chiltern," said\r\nLord Fawn.\r\n\r\n"About his marriage with Miss Effingham?"\r\n\r\n"It would be such an abominable shame to sacrifice the girl," said\r\nLord Fawn. "Only think of it. Everything is gone. The man is a\r\ndrunkard, and I don\'t believe he is any more reconciled to his father\r\nthan you are. Lady Laura Kennedy must have had some object in saying\r\nso."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps an invention of Finn\'s altogether," said Mr. Bonteen. "Those\r\nIrish fellows are just the men for that kind of thing."\r\n\r\n"A man, you know, so violent that nobody can hold him," said Lord\r\nFawn, thinking of Chiltern.\r\n\r\n"And so absurdly conceited," said Mr. Bonteen, thinking of Phineas.\r\n\r\n"A man who has never done anything, with all his advantages in the\r\nworld,--and never will."\r\n\r\n"He won\'t hold his place long," said Mr. Bonteen.\r\n\r\n"Whom do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Phineas Finn."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Finn. I was talking of Lord Chiltern. I believe Finn to be\r\na very good sort of a fellow, and he is undoubtedly clever. They say\r\nCantrip likes him amazingly. He\'ll do very well. But I don\'t believe\r\na word of this about Lord Chiltern." Then Mr. Bonteen felt himself to\r\nbe snubbed, and soon afterwards left Lord Fawn alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV\r\n\r\nConsolation\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day following Madame Goesler\'s dinner party, Phineas, though\r\nhe was early at his office, was not able to do much work, still\r\nfeeling that as regarded the realities of the world, his back\r\nwas broken. He might no doubt go on learning, and, after a time,\r\nmight be able to exert himself in a perhaps useful, but altogether\r\nuninteresting kind of way, doing his work simply because it was\r\nthere to be done,--as the carter or the tailor does his;--and from\r\nthe same cause, knowing that a man must have bread to live. But as\r\nfor ambition, and the idea of doing good, and the love of work for\r\nwork\'s sake,--as for the elastic springs of delicious and beneficent\r\nlabour,--all that was over for him. He would have worked from day\r\ntill night, and from night till day, and from month till month\r\nthroughout the year to have secured for Violet Effingham the\r\nassurance that her husband\'s position was worthy of her own. But now\r\nhe had no motive for such work as this. As long as he took the public\r\npay, he would earn it; and that was all.\r\n\r\nOn the next day things were a little better with him. He received a\r\nnote in the morning from Lord Cantrip saying that they two were to\r\nsee the Prime Minister that evening, in order that the whole question\r\nof the railway to the Rocky Mountains might be understood, and\r\nPhineas was driven to his work. Before the time of the meeting came\r\nhe had once more lost his own identity in great ideas of colonial\r\nwelfare, and had planned and peopled a mighty region on the Red\r\nRiver, which should have no sympathy with American democracy. When\r\nhe waited upon Mr. Gresham in the afternoon he said nothing about\r\nthe mighty region; indeed, he left it to Lord Cantrip to explain\r\nmost of the proposed arrangements,--speaking only a word or two here\r\nand there as occasion required. But he was aware that he had so far\r\nrecovered as to be able to save himself from losing ground during the\r\ninterview.\r\n\r\n"He\'s about the first Irishman we\'ve had that has been worth his\r\nsalt," said Mr. Gresham to his colleague afterwards.\r\n\r\n"That other Irishman was a terrible fellow," said Lord Cantrip,\r\nshaking his head.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day after his sorrow had befallen him, Phineas went\r\nagain to the cottage in Park Lane. And in order that he might not be\r\nbalked in his search for sympathy he wrote a line to Madame Goesler\r\nto ask if she would be at home. "I will be at home from five to\r\nsix,--and alone.--M. M. G." That was the answer from Marie Max\r\nGoesler, and Phineas was of course at the cottage a few minutes\r\nafter five. It is not, I think, surprising that a man when he wants\r\nsympathy in such a calamity as that which had now befallen Phineas\r\nFinn, should seek it from a woman. Women sympathise most effectually\r\nwith men, as men do with women. But it is, perhaps, a little odd that\r\na man when he wants consolation because his heart has been broken,\r\nalways likes to receive it from a pretty woman. One would be disposed\r\nto think that at such a moment he would be profoundly indifferent\r\nto such a matter, that no delight could come to him from female\r\nbeauty, and that all he would want would be the softness of a simply\r\nsympathetic soul. But he generally wants a soft hand as well, and an\r\neye that can be bright behind the mutual tear, and lips that shall\r\nbe young and fresh as they express their concern for his sorrow. All\r\nthese things were added to Phineas when he went to Madame Goesler in\r\nhis grief.\r\n\r\n\r\n"I am so glad to see you," said Madame Max.\r\n\r\n"You are very good-natured to let me come."\r\n\r\n"No;--but it is so good of you to trust me. But I was sure you would\r\ncome after what took place the other night. I saw that you were\r\npained, and I was so sorry for it."\r\n\r\n"I made such a fool of myself."\r\n\r\n"Not at all. And I thought that you were right to tell them when the\r\nquestion had been asked. If the thing was not to be kept a secret, it\r\nwas better to speak it out. You will get over it quicker in that way\r\nthan in any other. I have never seen the young lord, myself."\r\n\r\n"Oh, there is nothing amiss about him. As to what Lord Fawn said, the\r\nhalf of it is simply exaggeration, and the other half is\r\nmisunderstood."\r\n\r\n"In this country it is so much to be a lord," said Madame Goesler.\r\n\r\nPhineas thought a moment of that matter before he replied. All the\r\nStandish family had been very good to him, and Violet Effingham had\r\nbeen very good. It was not the fault of any of them that he was now\r\nwretched and back-broken. He had meditated much on this, and had\r\nresolved that he would not even think evil of them. "I do not in my\r\nheart believe that that has had anything to do with it," he said.\r\n\r\n"But it has, my friend,--always. I do not know your Violet\r\nEffingham."\r\n\r\n"She is not mine."\r\n\r\n"Well;--I do not know this Violet that is not yours. I have met her,\r\nand did not specially admire her. But then the tastes of men and\r\nwomen about beauty are never the same. But I know she is one that\r\nalways lives with lords and countesses. A girl who always lived with\r\ncountesses feels it to be hard to settle down as a plain Mistress."\r\n\r\n"She has had plenty of choice among all sorts of men. It was not the\r\ntitle. She would not have accepted Chiltern unless she had--. But\r\nwhat is the use of talking of it?"\r\n\r\n"They had known each other long?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes,--as children. And the Earl desired it of all things."\r\n\r\n"Ah;--then he arranged it."\r\n\r\n"Not exactly. Nobody could arrange anything for Chiltern,--nor, as\r\nfar as that goes, for Miss Effingham. They arranged it themselves, I\r\nfancy."\r\n\r\n"You had asked her?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--twice. And she had refused him more than twice. I have nothing\r\nfor which to blame her; but yet I had thought,--I had thought--"\r\n\r\n"She is a jilt then?"\r\n\r\n"No;--I will not let you say that of her. She is no jilt. But I think\r\nshe has been strangely ignorant of her own mind. What is the use of\r\ntalking of it, Madame Goesler?"\r\n\r\n"None;--only sometimes it is better to speak a word, than to keep\r\none\'s sorrow to oneself."\r\n\r\n"So it is;--and there is not one in the world to whom I can speak\r\nsuch a word, except yourself. Is not that odd? I have sisters, but\r\nthey have never heard of Miss Effingham, and would be quite\r\nindifferent."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps they have some other favourites."\r\n\r\n"Ah;--well. That does not matter, And my best friend here in London\r\nis Lord Chiltern\'s own sister."\r\n\r\n"She knew of your attachment?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes."\r\n\r\n"And she told you of Miss Effingham\'s engagement. Was she glad of\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"She has always desired the marriage. And yet I think she would have\r\nbeen satisfied had it been otherwise. But of course her heart must\r\nbe with her brother. I need not have troubled myself to go to\r\nBlankenberg after all."\r\n\r\n"It was for the best, perhaps. Everybody says you behaved so well."\r\n\r\n"I could not but go, as things were then."\r\n\r\n"What if you had--shot him?"\r\n\r\n"There would have been an end of everything. She would never have\r\nseen me after that. Indeed I should have shot myself next, feeling\r\nthat there was nothing else left for me to do."\r\n\r\n"Ah;--you English are so peculiar. But I suppose it is best not to\r\nshoot a man. And, Mr. Finn, there are other ladies in the world\r\nprettier than Miss Violet Effingham. No;--of course you will not\r\nadmit that now. Just at this moment, and for a month or two, she\r\nis peerless, and you will feel yourself to be of all men the most\r\nunfortunate. But you have the ball at your feet. I know no one so\r\nyoung who has got the ball at his feet so well. I call it nothing to\r\nhave the ball at your feet if you are born with it there. It is so\r\neasy to be a lord if your father is one before you,--and so easy\r\nto marry a pretty girl if you can make her a countess. But to make\r\nyourself a lord, or to be as good as a lord, when nothing has been\r\nborn to you,--that I call very much. And there are women, and pretty\r\nwomen too, Mr. Finn, who have spirit enough to understand this, and\r\nto think that the man, after all, is more important than the lord."\r\nThen she sang the old well-worn verse of the Scotch song with\r\nwonderful spirit, and with a clearness of voice and knowledge of\r\nmusic for which he had hitherto never given her credit.\r\n\r\n\r\n   "A prince can mak\' a belted knight,\r\n      A marquis, duke, and a\' that;\r\n    But an honest man\'s aboon his might,\r\n      Guid faith he mauna fa\' that."\r\n\r\n\r\n"I did not know that you sung, Madame Goesler."\r\n\r\n"Only now and then when something specially requires it. And I am\r\nvery fond of Scotch songs. I will sing to you now if you like it."\r\nThen she sang the whole song,--"A man\'s a man for a\' that," she\r\nsaid as she finished. "Even though he cannot get the special bit of\r\npainted Eve\'s flesh for which his heart has had a craving." Then she\r\nsang again:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   "There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far,\r\n    Who would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar."\r\n\r\n\r\n"But young Lochinvar got his bride," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Take the spirit of the lines, Mr. Finn, which is true; and not the\r\ntale as it is told, which is probably false. I often think that Jock\r\nof Hazledean, and young Lochinvar too, probably lived to repent their\r\nbargains. We will hope that Lord Chiltern may not do so."\r\n\r\n"I am sure he never will."\r\n\r\n"That is all right. And as for you, do you for a while think of your\r\npolitics, and your speeches, and your colonies, rather than of your\r\nlove. You are at home there, and no Lord Chiltern can rob you of\r\nyour success. And if you are down in the mouth, come to me, and I\r\nwill sing you a Scotch song. And, look you, the next time I ask you\r\nto dinner I will promise you that Mrs. Bonteen shall not be here.\r\nGood-bye." She gave him her hand, which was very soft, and left it\r\nfor a moment in his, and he was consoled.\r\n\r\nMadame Goesler, when she was alone, threw herself on to her chair\r\nand began to think of things. In these days she would often ask\r\nherself what in truth was the object of her ambition, and the aim of\r\nher life. Now at this moment she had in her hand a note from the Duke\r\nof Omnium. The Duke had allowed himself to say something about a\r\nphotograph, which had justified her in writing to him,--or which she\r\nhad taken for such justification. And the Duke had replied. "He would\r\nnot," he said, "lose the opportunity of waiting upon her in person\r\nwhich the presentation of the little gift might afford him." It would\r\nbe a great success to have the Duke of Omnium at her house,--but to\r\nwhat would the success reach? What was her definite object,--or had\r\nshe any? In what way could she make herself happy? She could not say\r\nthat she was happy yet. The hours with her were too long and the days\r\ntoo many.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Omnium should come,--if he would. And she was quite\r\nresolved as to this,--that if the Duke did come she would not be\r\nafraid of him. Heavens and earth! What would be the feelings of such\r\na woman as her, were the world to greet her some fine morning as\r\nDuchess of Omnium! Then she made up her mind very resolutely on one\r\nsubject. Should the Duke give her any opportunity she would take\r\na very short time in letting him know what was the extent of her\r\nambition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV\r\n\r\nLord Chiltern at Saulsby\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Chiltern did exactly as he said he would do. He wrote to his\r\nfather as he passed through Carlisle, and at once went on to his\r\nhunting at Willingford. But his letter was very stiff and ungainly,\r\nand it may be doubted whether Miss Effingham was not wrong in\r\nrefusing the offer which he had made to her as to the dictation of\r\nit. He began his letter, "My Lord," and did not much improve the\r\nstyle as he went on with it. The reader may as well see the whole\r\nletter;--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Railway Hotel, Carlisle,\r\n   December 27, 186--.\r\n\r\n   MY LORD,\r\n\r\n   I am now on my way from Loughlinter to London, and write\r\n   this letter to you in compliance with a promise made by\r\n   me to my sister and to Miss Effingham. I have asked Violet\r\n   to be my wife, and she has accepted me, and they think\r\n   that you will be pleased to hear that this has been done.\r\n   I shall be, of course, obliged, if you will instruct Mr.\r\n   Edwards to let me know what you would propose to do in\r\n   regard to settlements. Laura thinks that you will wish to\r\n   see both Violet and myself at Saulsby. For myself, I can\r\n   only say that, should you desire me to come, I will do\r\n   so on receiving your assurance that I shall be treated\r\n   neither with fatted calves nor with reproaches. I am not\r\n   aware that I have deserved either.\r\n\r\n   I am, my lord, yours affect.,\r\n\r\n   CHILTERN.\r\n\r\n   P.S.--My address will be "The Bull, Willingford."\r\n\r\n\r\nThat last word, in which he half-declared himself to be joined in\r\naffectionate relations to his father, caused him a world of trouble.\r\nBut he could find no term for expressing, without a circumlocution\r\nwhich was disagreeable to him, exactly that position of feeling\r\ntowards his father which really belonged to him. He would have\r\nwritten "yours with affection," or "yours with deadly enmity," or\r\n"yours with respect," or "yours with most profound indifference,"\r\nexactly in accordance with the state of his father\'s mind, if he had\r\nonly known what was that state. He was afraid of going beyond his\r\nfather in any offer of reconciliation, and was firmly fixed in his\r\nresolution that he would never be either repentant or submissive\r\nin regard to the past. If his father had wishes for the future,\r\nhe would comply with them if he could do so without unreasonable\r\ninconvenience, but he would not give way a single point as to things\r\ndone and gone. If his father should choose to make any reference to\r\nthem, his father must prepare for battle.\r\n\r\nThe Earl was of course disgusted by the pertinacious obstinacy of his\r\nson\'s letter, and for an hour or two swore to himself that he would\r\nnot answer it. But it is natural that the father should yearn for the\r\nson, while the son\'s feeling for the father is of a very much weaker\r\nnature. Here, at any rate, was that engagement made which he had\r\never desired. And his son had made a step, though it was so very\r\nunsatisfactory a step, towards reconciliation. When the old man read\r\nthe letter a second time, he skipped that reference to fatted calves\r\nwhich had been so peculiarly distasteful to him, and before the\r\nevening had passed he had answered his son as follows;--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Saulsby, December 29, 186--.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR CHILTERN,\r\n\r\n   I have received your letter, and am truly delighted to hear that dear\r\n   Violet has accepted you as her husband. Her fortune will be very\r\n   material to you, but she herself is better than any fortune. You have\r\n   long known my opinion of her. I shall be proud to welcome her as a\r\n   daughter to my house.\r\n\r\n   I shall of course write to her immediately, and will endeavour to\r\n   settle some early day for her coming here. When I have done so, I\r\n   will write to you again, and can only say that I will endeavour to\r\n   make Saulsby comfortable to you.\r\n\r\n   Your affectionate father,\r\n\r\n   BRENTFORD.\r\n\r\n   Richards, the groom, is still here. You had perhaps better write to\r\n   him direct about your horses.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the middle of February arrangements had all been made, and Violet\r\nmet her lover at his father\'s house. She in the meantime had been\r\nwith her aunt, and had undergone a good deal of mild unceasing\r\npersecution. "My dear Violet," said her aunt to her on her arrival\r\nat Baddingham, speaking with a solemnity that ought to have been\r\nterrible to the young lady, "I do not know what to say to you."\r\n\r\n"Say \'how d\'you do?\' aunt," said Violet.\r\n\r\n"I mean about this engagement," said Lady Baldock, with an increase\r\nof awe-inspiring severity in her voice.\r\n\r\n"Say nothing about it at all, if you don\'t like it," said Violet.\r\n\r\n"How can I say nothing about it? How can I be silent? Or how am I to\r\ncongratulate you?"\r\n\r\n"The least said, perhaps, the soonest mended," and Violet smiled as\r\nshe spoke.\r\n\r\n"That is very well, and if I had no duty to perform, I would be\r\nsilent. But, Violet, you have been left in my charge. If I see you\r\nshipwrecked in life, I shall ever tell myself that the fault has been\r\npartly mine."\r\n\r\n"Nay, aunt, that will be quite unnecessary. I will always admit that\r\nyou did everything in your power to--to--to--make me run straight, as\r\nthe sporting men say."\r\n\r\n"Sporting men! Oh, Violet."\r\n\r\n"And you know, aunt, I still hope that I shall be found to have kept\r\non the right side of the posts. You will find that poor Lord Chiltern\r\nis not so black as he is painted."\r\n\r\n"But why take anybody that is black at all?"\r\n\r\n"I like a little shade in the picture, aunt."\r\n\r\n"Look at Lord Fawn."\r\n\r\n"I have looked at him."\r\n\r\n"A young nobleman beginning a career of useful official life, that\r\nwill end in--; there is no knowing what it may end in."\r\n\r\n"I daresay not;--but it never could have begun or ended in my being\r\nLady Fawn."\r\n\r\n"And Mr. Appledom!"\r\n\r\n"Poor Mr. Appledom. I do like Mr. Appledom. But, you see, aunt, I\r\nlike Lord Chiltern so much better. A young woman will go by her\r\nfeelings."\r\n\r\n"And yet you refused him a dozen times."\r\n\r\n"I never counted the times, aunt; but not quite so many as that."\r\n\r\nThe same thing was repeated over and over again during the month that\r\nMiss Effingham remained at Baddingham, but Lady Baldock had no power\r\nof interfering, and Violet bore her persecution bravely. Her future\r\nhusband was generally spoken of as "that violent young man," and\r\nhints were thrown out as to the personal injuries to which his wife\r\nmight be possibly subjected. But the threatened bride only laughed,\r\nand spoke of these coming dangers as part of the general lot of\r\nmarried women. "I daresay, if the truth were known, my uncle Baldock\r\ndid not always keep his temper," she once said. Now, the truth was,\r\nas Violet well knew, that "my uncle Baldock" had been dumb as a sheep\r\nbefore the shearers in the hands of his wife, and had never been\r\nknown to do anything improper by those who had been most intimate\r\nwith him even in his earlier days. "Your uncle Baldock, miss," said\r\nthe outraged aunt, "was a nobleman as different in his manner of\r\nlife from Lord Chiltern as chalk from cheese." "But then comes the\r\nquestion, which is the cheese?" said Violet. Lady Baldock would not\r\nargue the question any further, but stalked out of the room.\r\n\r\nLady Laura Kennedy met them at Saulsby, having had something of a\r\nbattle with her husband before she left her home to do so. When she\r\ntold him of her desire to assist at this reconciliation between her\r\nfather and brother, he replied by pointing out that her first duty\r\nwas at Loughlinter, and before the interview was ended had come to\r\nexpress an opinion that that duty was very much neglected. She in the\r\nmeantime had declared that she would go to Saulsby, or that she would\r\nexplain to her father that she was forbidden by her husband to do\r\nso. "And I also forbid any such communication," said Mr. Kennedy. In\r\nanswer to which, Lady Laura told him that there were some marital\r\ncommands which she should not consider it to be her duty to obey.\r\nWhen matters had come to this pass, it may be conceived that both Mr.\r\nKennedy and his wife were very unhappy. She had almost resolved that\r\nshe would take steps to enable her to live apart from her husband;\r\nand he had begun to consider what course he would pursue if such\r\nsteps were taken. The wife was subject to her husband by the laws\r\nboth of God and man; and Mr. Kennedy was one who thought much of\r\nsuch laws. In the meantime, Lady Laura carried her point and went to\r\nSaulsby, leaving her husband to go up to London and begin the session\r\nby himself.\r\n\r\nLady Laura and Violet were both at Saulsby before Lord Chiltern\r\narrived, and many were the consultations which were held between them\r\nas to the best mode in which things might be arranged. Violet was of\r\nopinion that there had better be no arrangement, that Lord Chiltern\r\nshould be allowed to come in and take his father\'s hand, and sit down\r\nto dinner,--and that so things should fall into their places. Lady\r\nLaura was rather in favour of some scene. But the interview had taken\r\nplace before either of them were able to say a word. Lord Chiltern,\r\non his arrival, had gone immediately to his father, taking the Earl\r\nvery much by surprise, and had come off best in the encounter.\r\n\r\n"My lord," said he, walking up to his father with his hand out, "I am\r\nvery glad to come back to Saulsby." He had written to his sister to\r\nsay that he would be at Saulsby on that day, but had named no hour.\r\nHe now appeared between ten and eleven in the morning, and his father\r\nhad as yet made no preparation for him,--had arranged no appropriate\r\nwords. He had walked in at the front door, and had asked for the\r\nEarl. The Earl was in his own morning-room,--a gloomy room, full of\r\ndark books and darker furniture, and thither Lord Chiltern had at\r\nonce gone. The two women still were sitting together over the fire in\r\nthe breakfast-room, and knew nothing of his arrival.\r\n\r\n"Oswald!" said his father, "I hardly expected you so early."\r\n\r\n"I have come early. I came across country, and slept at Birmingham. I\r\nsuppose Violet is here."\r\n\r\n"Yes, she is here,--and Laura. They will be very glad to see you. So\r\nam I." And the father took the son\'s hand for the second time.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir," said Lord Chiltern, looking his father full in the\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"I have been very much pleased by this engagement," continued the\r\nEarl.\r\n\r\n"What do you think I must be, then?" said the son, laughing. "I\r\nhave been at it, you know, off and on, ever so many years; and have\r\nsometimes thought I was quite a fool not to get it out of my head.\r\nBut I couldn\'t get it out of my head. And now she talks as though it\r\nwere she who had been in love with me all the time!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps she was," said the father.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe it in the least. She may be a little so now."\r\n\r\n"I hope you mean that she always shall be so."\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t be the worst husband in the world, I hope; and I am quite\r\nsure I shan\'t be the best. I will go and see her now. I suppose I\r\nshall find her somewhere in the house. I thought it best to see you\r\nfirst."\r\n\r\n"Stop half a moment, Oswald," said the Earl. And then Lord Brentford\r\ndid make something of a shambling speech, in which he expressed a\r\nhope that they two might for the future live together on friendly\r\nterms, forgetting the past. He ought to have been prepared for the\r\noccasion, and the speech was poor and shambling. But I think that it\r\nwas more useful than it might have been, had it been uttered roundly\r\nand with that paternal and almost majestic effect which he would have\r\nachieved had he been thoroughly prepared. But the roundness and the\r\nmajesty would have gone against the grain with his son, and there\r\nwould have been a danger of some outbreak. As it was, Lord Chiltern\r\nsmiled, and muttered some word about things being "all right," and\r\nthen made his way out of the room. "That\'s a great deal better than I\r\nhad hoped," he said to himself; "and it has all come from my going in\r\nwithout being announced." But there was still a fear upon him that\r\nhis father even yet might prepare a speech, and speak it, to the\r\ngreat peril of their mutual comfort.\r\n\r\nHis meeting with Violet was of course pleasant enough. Now that she\r\nhad succumbed, and had told herself and had told him that she loved\r\nhim, she did not scruple to be as generous as a maiden should be who\r\nhas acknowledged herself to be conquered, and has rendered herself to\r\nthe conqueror. She would walk with him and ride with him, and take a\r\nlively interest in the performances of all his horses, and listen to\r\nhunting stories as long as he chose to tell them. In all this, she\r\nwas so good and so loving that Lady Laura was more than once tempted\r\nto throw in her teeth her old, often-repeated assertions, that she\r\nwas not prone to be in love,--that it was not her nature to feel any\r\nardent affection for a man, and that, therefore, she would probably\r\nremain unmarried. "You begrudge me my little bits of pleasure,"\r\nViolet said, in answer to one such attack. "No;--but it is so odd to\r\nsee you, of all women, become so love-lorn," "I am not love-lorn,"\r\nsaid Violet, "but I like the freedom of telling him everything and\r\nof hearing everything from him, and of having him for my own best\r\nfriend. He might go away for twelve months, and I should not be\r\nunhappy, believing, as I do, that he would be true to me." All of\r\nwhich set Lady Laura thinking whether her friend had not been wiser\r\nthan she had been. She had never known anything of that sort of\r\nfriendship with her husband which already seemed to be quite\r\nestablished between these two.\r\n\r\nIn her misery one day Lady Laura told the whole story of her own\r\nunhappiness to her brother, saying nothing of Phineas Finn,--thinking\r\nnothing of him as she told her story, but speaking more strongly\r\nperhaps than she should have done, of the terrible dreariness of her\r\nlife at Loughlinter, and of her inability to induce her husband to\r\nalter it for her sake.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that he,--ill-treats you?" said the brother, with a\r\nscowl on his face which seemed to indicate that he would like no task\r\nbetter than that of resenting such ill-treatment.\r\n\r\n"He does not beat me, if you mean that."\r\n\r\n"Is he cruel to you? Does he use harsh language?"\r\n\r\n"He never said a word in his life either to me or, as I believe, to\r\nany other human being, that he would think himself bound to regret."\r\n\r\n"What is it then?"\r\n\r\n"He simply chooses to have his own way, and his way cannot be my way.\r\nHe is hard, and dry, and just, and dispassionate, and he wishes me to\r\nbe the same. That is all."\r\n\r\n"I tell you fairly, Laura, as far as I am concerned, I never could\r\nspeak to him. He is antipathetic to me. But then I am not his wife."\r\n\r\n"I am;--and I suppose I must bear it."\r\n\r\n"Have you spoken to my father?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Or to Violet?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And what does she say?"\r\n\r\n"What can she say? She has nothing to say. Nor have you. Nor, if I am\r\ndriven to leave him, can I make the world understand why I do so. To\r\nbe simply miserable, as I am, is nothing to the world."\r\n\r\n"I could never understand why you married him."\r\n\r\n"Do not be cruel to me, Oswald."\r\n\r\n"Cruel! I will stick by you in any way that you wish. If you think\r\nwell of it, I will go off to Loughlinter to-morrow, and tell him that\r\nyou will never return to him. And if you are not safe from him here\r\nat Saulsby, you shall go abroad with us. I am sure Violet would not\r\nobject. I will not be cruel to you."\r\n\r\nBut in truth neither of Lady Laura\'s councillors was able to give\r\nher advice that could serve her. She felt that she could not leave\r\nher husband without other cause than now existed, although she felt,\r\nalso, that to go back to him was to go back to utter wretchedness.\r\nAnd when she saw Violet and her brother together there came to her\r\ndreams of what might have been her own happiness had she kept herself\r\nfree from those terrible bonds in which she was now held a prisoner.\r\nShe could not get out of her heart the remembrance of that young man\r\nwho would have been her lover, if she would have let him,--of whose\r\nlove for herself she had been aware before she had handed herself\r\nover as a bale of goods to her unloved, unloving husband. She had\r\nmarried Mr. Kennedy because she was afraid that otherwise she might\r\nfind herself forced to own that she loved that other man who was\r\nthen a nobody;--almost nobody. It was not Mr. Kennedy\'s money that\r\nhad bought her. This woman in regard to money had shown herself\r\nto be as generous as the sun. But in marrying Mr. Kennedy she had\r\nmaintained herself in her high position, among the first of her own\r\npeople,--among the first socially and among the first politically.\r\nBut had she married Phineas,--had she become Lady Laura Finn,--there\r\nwould have been a great descent. She could not have entertained the\r\nleading men of her party. She would not have been on a level with the\r\nwives and daughters of Cabinet Ministers. She might, indeed, have\r\nremained unmarried! But she knew that had she done so,--had she so\r\nresolved,--that which she called her fancy would have been too strong\r\nfor her. She would not have remained unmarried. At that time it was\r\nher fate to be either Lady Laura Kennedy or Lady Laura Finn. And she\r\nhad chosen to be Lady Laura Kennedy. To neither Violet Effingham nor\r\nto her brother could she tell one half of the sorrow which afflicted\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"I shall go back to Loughlinter," she said to her brother.\r\n\r\n"Do not, unless you wish it," he answered.\r\n\r\n"I do not wish it. But I shall do it. Mr. Kennedy is in London now,\r\nand has been there since Parliament met, but he will be in Scotland\r\nagain in March, and I will go and meet him there. I told him that I\r\nwould do so when I left."\r\n\r\n"But you will go up to London?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose so. I must do as he tells me, of course. What I mean is, I\r\nwill try it for another year."\r\n\r\n"If it does not succeed, come to us."\r\n\r\n"I cannot say what I will do. I would die if I knew how. Never be a\r\ntyrant, Oswald; or at any rate, not a cold tyrant. And remember this,\r\nthere is no tyranny to a woman like telling her of her duty. Talk of\r\nbeating a woman! Beating might often be a mercy."\r\n\r\nLord Chiltern remained ten days at Saulsby, and at last did not get\r\naway without a few unpleasant words with his father,--or without a\r\nfew words that were almost unpleasant with his mistress. On his first\r\narrival he had told his sister that he should go on a certain day,\r\nand some intimation to this effect had probably been conveyed to the\r\nEarl. But when his son told him one evening that the post-chaise had\r\nbeen ordered for seven o\'clock the next morning, he felt that his son\r\nwas ungracious and abrupt. There were many things still to be said,\r\nand indeed there had been no speech of any account made at all as\r\nyet.\r\n\r\n"That is very sudden," said the Earl.\r\n\r\n"I thought Laura had told you."\r\n\r\n"She has not told me a word lately. She may have said something\r\nbefore you came here. What is there to hurry you?"\r\n\r\n"I thought ten days would be as long as you would care to have me\r\nhere, and as I said that I would be back by the first, I would rather\r\nnot change my plans."\r\n\r\n"You are going to hunt?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I shall hunt till the end of March."\r\n\r\n"You might have hunted here, Oswald." But the son made no sign of\r\nchanging his plans; and the father, seeing that he would not change\r\nthem, became solemn and severe. There were a few words which he must\r\nsay to his son,--something of a speech that he must make;--so he led\r\nthe way into the room with the dark books and the dark furniture, and\r\npointed to a great deep arm-chair for his son\'s accommodation. But as\r\nhe did not sit down himself, neither did Lord Chiltern. Lord Chiltern\r\nunderstood very well how great is the advantage of a standing orator\r\nover a sitting recipient of his oratory, and that advantage he would\r\nnot give to his father. "I had hoped to have an opportunity of saying\r\na few words to you about the future," said the Earl.\r\n\r\n"I think we shall be married in July," said Lord Chiltern.\r\n\r\n"So I have heard;--but after that. Now I do not want to interfere,\r\nOswald, and of course the less so, because Violet\'s money will to\r\na great degree restore the inroads which have been made upon the\r\nproperty."\r\n\r\n"It will more than restore them altogether."\r\n\r\n"Not if her estate be settled on a second son, Oswald, and I hear\r\nfrom Lady Baldock that that is the wish of her relations."\r\n\r\n"She shall have her own way,--as she ought. What that way is I do not\r\nknow. I have not even asked about it. She asked me, and I told her to\r\nspeak to you."\r\n\r\n"Of course I should wish it to go with the family property. Of course\r\nthat would be best."\r\n\r\n"She shall have her own way,--as far as I am concerned."\r\n\r\n"But it is not about that, Oswald, that I would speak. What are your\r\nplans of life when you are married?"\r\n\r\n"Plans of life?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--plans of life. I suppose you have some plans. I suppose you\r\nmean to apply yourself to some useful occupation?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know really, sir, that I am of much use for any purpose."\r\nLord Chiltern laughed as he said this, but did not laugh pleasantly.\r\n\r\n"You would not be a drone in the hive always?"\r\n\r\n"As far as I can see, sir, we who call ourselves lords generally are\r\ndrones."\r\n\r\n"I deny it," said the Earl, becoming quite energetic as he defended\r\nhis order. "I deny it utterly. I know no class of men who do work\r\nmore useful or more honest. Am I a drone? Have I been so from my\r\nyouth upwards? I have always worked, either in the one House or\r\nin the other, and those of my fellows with whom I have been most\r\nintimate have worked also. The same career is open to you."\r\n\r\n"You mean politics?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I mean politics."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care for politics. I see no difference in parties."\r\n\r\n"But you should care for politics, and you should see a difference in\r\nparties. It is your duty to do so. My wish is that you should go into\r\nParliament."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t do that, sir."\r\n\r\n"And why not?"\r\n\r\n"In the first place, sir, you have not got a seat to offer me.\r\nYou have managed matters among you in such a way that poor little\r\nLoughton has been swallowed up. If I were to canvass the electors of\r\nSmotherem, I don\'t think that many would look very sweet on me."\r\n\r\n"There is the county, Oswald."\r\n\r\n"And whom am I to turn out? I should spend four or five thousand\r\npounds, and have nothing but vexation in return for it. I had rather\r\nnot begin that game, and indeed I am too old for Parliament. I did\r\nnot take it up early enough to believe in it."\r\n\r\nAll this made the Earl very angry, and from these things they went\r\non to worse things. When questioned again as to the future, Lord\r\nChiltern scowled, and at last declared that it was his idea to live\r\nabroad in the summer for his wife\'s recreation, and somewhere down\r\nin the shires during the winter for his own. He would admit of no\r\npurpose higher than recreation, and when his father again talked to\r\nhim of a nobleman\'s duty, he said that he knew of no other special\r\nduty than that of not exceeding his income. Then his father made a\r\nlonger speech than before, and at the end of it Lord Chiltern simply\r\nwished him good night. "It\'s getting late, and I\'ve promised to see\r\nViolet before I go to bed. Good-bye." Then he was off, and Lord\r\nBrentford was left there, standing with his back to the fire.\r\n\r\nAfter that Lord Chiltern had a discussion with Violet, which lasted\r\nnearly half the night; and during the discussion she told him more\r\nthan once that he was wrong. "Such as I am you must take me, or leave\r\nme," he said, in anger. "Nay; there is no choice now," she answered.\r\n"I have taken you, and I will stick by you,--whether you are right or\r\nwrong. But when I think you wrong, I shall say so." He swore to her\r\nas he pressed her to his heart that she was the finest, grandest,\r\nsweetest woman that ever the world had produced. But still there was\r\npresent on his palate, when he left her, the bitter taste of her\r\nreprimand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI\r\n\r\nWhat the People in Marylebone Thought\r\n\r\n\r\nPhineas Finn, when the session began, was still hard at work upon his\r\nCanada bill, and in his work found some relief for his broken back.\r\nHe went into the matter with all his energy, and before the debate\r\ncame on, knew much more about the seven thousand inhabitants of some\r\nhundreds of thousands of square miles at the back of Canada, than\r\nhe did of the people of London or of County Clare. And he found\r\nsome consolation also in the good-nature of Madame Goesler, whose\r\ndrawing-room was always open to him. He could talk freely now to\r\nMadame Goesler about Violet, and had even ventured to tell her that\r\nonce, in old days, he had thought of loving Lady Laura Standish.\r\nHe spoke of those days as being very old; and then he perhaps said\r\nsome word to her about dear little Mary Flood Jones. I think that\r\nthere was not much in his career of which he did not say something\r\nto Madame Goesler, and that he received from her a good deal of\r\nexcellent advice and encouragement in the direction of his political\r\nambition. "A man should work," she said,--"and you do work. A woman\r\ncan only look on, and admire and long. What is there that I can do?\r\nI can learn to care for these Canadians, just because you care for\r\nthem. If it was the beavers that you told me of, I should have to\r\ncare for the beavers." Then Phineas of course told her that such\r\nsympathy from her was all and all to him. But the reader must not\r\non this account suppose that he was untrue in his love to Violet\r\nEffingham. His back was altogether broken by his fall, and he was\r\nquite aware that such was the fact. Not as yet, at least, had come\r\nto him any remotest idea that a cure was possible.\r\n\r\nEarly in March he heard that Lady Laura was up in town, and of course\r\nhe was bound to go to her. The information was given to him by Mr.\r\nKennedy himself, who told him that he had been to Scotland to fetch\r\nher. In these days there was an acknowledged friendship between these\r\ntwo, but there was no intimacy. Indeed, Mr. Kennedy was a man who\r\nwas hardly intimate with any other man. With Phineas he now and\r\nthen exchanged a few words in the lobby of the House, and when they\r\nchanced to meet each other, they met as friends. Mr. Kennedy had no\r\nstrong wish to see again in his house the man respecting whom he had\r\nventured to caution his wife; but he was thoughtful; and thinking\r\nover it all, he found it better to ask him there. No one must know\r\nthat there was any reason why Phineas should not come to his house;\r\nespecially as all the world knew that Phineas had protected him from\r\nthe garrotters. "Lady Laura is in town now," he said; "you must go\r\nand see her before long." Phineas of course promised that he would\r\ngo.\r\n\r\nIn these days Phineas was beginning to be aware that he had\r\nenemies,--though he could not understand why anybody should be his\r\nenemy now that Violet Effingham had decided against him. There was\r\npoor Laurence Fitzgibbon, indeed, whom he had superseded at the\r\nColonial Office, but Laurence Fitzgibbon, to give merit where merit\r\nwas due, felt no animosity against him at all. "You\'re welcome, me\r\nboy; you\'re welcome,--as far as yourself goes. But as for the party,\r\nbedad, it\'s rotten to the core, and won\'t stand another session.\r\nMind, it\'s I who tell you so." And the poor idle Irishman, in so\r\nspeaking, spoke the truth as well as he knew it. But the Ratlers and\r\nthe Bonteens were Finn\'s bitter foes, and did not scruple to let him\r\nknow that such was the case. Barrington Erle had scruples on the\r\nsubject, and in a certain mildly apologetic way still spoke well of\r\nthe young man, whom he had himself first introduced into political\r\nlife only four years since;--but there was no earnestness or\r\ncordiality in Barrington Erle\'s manner, and Phineas knew that his\r\nfirst staunch friend could no longer be regarded as a pillar of\r\nsupport. But there was a set of men, quite as influential,--so\r\nPhineas thought,--as the busy politicians of the club, who were very\r\nfriendly to him. These were men, generally of high position, of\r\nsteady character,--hard workers,--who thought quite as much of what\r\na man did in his office as what he said in the House. Lords Cantrip,\r\nThrift, and Fawn were of this class,--and they were all very\r\ncourteous to Phineas. Envious men began to say of him that he cared\r\nlittle now for any one of the party who had not a handle to his name,\r\nand that he preferred to live with lords and lordlings. This was hard\r\nupon him, as the great political ambition of his life was to call Mr.\r\nMonk his friend; and he would sooner have acted with Mr. Monk than\r\nwith any other man in the Cabinet. But though Mr. Monk had not\r\ndeserted him, there had come to be little of late in common between\r\nthe two. His life was becoming that of a parliamentary official\r\nrather than that of a politician;--whereas, though Mr. Monk was in\r\noffice, his public life was purely political. Mr. Monk had great\r\nideas of his own which he intended to hold, whether by holding them\r\nhe might remain in office or be forced out of office; and he was\r\nindifferent as to the direction which things in this respect might\r\ntake with him. But Phineas, who had achieved his declared object in\r\ngetting into place, felt that he was almost constrained to adopt\r\nthe views of others, let them be what they might. Men spoke to him,\r\nas though his parliamentary career were wholly at the disposal of\r\nthe Government,--as though he were like a proxy in Mr. Gresham\'s\r\npocket,--with this difference, that when directed to get up and\r\nspeak on a subject he was bound to do so. This annoyed him, and he\r\ncomplained to Mr. Monk; but Mr. Monk only shrugged his shoulders and\r\ntold him that he must make his choice. He soon discovered Mr. Monk\'s\r\nmeaning. "If you choose to make Parliament a profession,--as you have\r\nchosen,--you can have no right even to think of independence. If the\r\ncountry finds you out when you are in Parliament, and then invites\r\nyou to office, of course the thing is different. But the latter is a\r\nslow career, and probably would not have suited you." That was the\r\nmeaning of what Mr. Monk said to him. After all, these official and\r\nparliamentary honours were greater when seen at a distance than he\r\nfound them to be now that he possessed them. Mr. Low worked ten hours\r\na day, and could rarely call a day his own; but, after all, with all\r\nthis work, Mr. Low was less of a slave, and more independent, than\r\nwas he, Phineas Finn, Under-Secretary of State, the friend of Cabinet\r\nMinisters, and Member of Parliament since his twenty-fifth year! He\r\nbegan to dislike the House, and to think it a bore to sit on the\r\nTreasury bench;--he, who a few years since had regarded Parliament\r\nas the British heaven on earth, and who, since he had been in\r\nParliament, had looked at that bench with longing envious eyes.\r\nLaurence Fitzgibbon, who seemed to have as much to eat and drink as\r\never, and a bed also to lie on, could come and go in the House as he\r\npleased, since his--resignation.\r\n\r\nAnd there was a new trouble coming. The Reform Bill for England had\r\npassed; but now there was to be another Reform Bill for Ireland. Let\r\nthem pass what bill they might, this would not render necessary a\r\nnew Irish election till the entire House should be dissolved. But he\r\nfeared that he would be called upon to vote for the abolition of his\r\nown borough,--and for other points almost equally distasteful to him.\r\nHe knew that he would not be consulted,--but would be called upon to\r\nvote, and perhaps to speak; and was certain that if he did so, there\r\nwould be war between him and his constituents. Lord Tulla had already\r\ncommunicated to him his ideas that, for certain excellent reasons,\r\nLoughshane ought to be spared. But this evil was, he hoped, a distant\r\none. It was generally thought that, as the English Reform Bill had\r\nbeen passed last year, and as the Irish bill, if carried, could not\r\nbe immediately operative, the doing of the thing might probably be\r\npostponed to the next session.\r\n\r\nWhen he first saw Lady Laura he was struck by the great change in her\r\nlook and manner. She seemed to him to be old and worn, and he judged\r\nher to be wretched,--as she was. She had written to him to say that\r\nshe would be at her father\'s house on such and such a morning, and\r\nhe had gone to her there. "It is of no use your coming to Grosvenor\r\nPlace," she said. "I see nobody there, and the house is like a\r\nprison." Later in the interview she told him not to come and dine\r\nthere, even though Mr. Kennedy should ask him.\r\n\r\n"And why not?" he demanded.\r\n\r\n"Because everything would be stiff, and cold, and uncomfortable. I\r\nsuppose you do not wish to make your way into a lady\'s house if she\r\nasks you not." There was a sort of smile on her face as she said\r\nthis, but he could perceive that it was a very bitter smile. "You can\r\neasily excuse yourself."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I can excuse myself."\r\n\r\n"Then do so. If you are particularly anxious to dine with Mr.\r\nKennedy, you can easily do so at your club." In the tone of her\r\nvoice, and the words she used, she hardly attempted to conceal her\r\ndislike of her husband.\r\n\r\n"And now tell me about Miss Effingham," he said.\r\n\r\n"There is nothing for me to tell."\r\n\r\n"Yes there is;--much to tell. You need not spare me. I do not pretend\r\nto deny to you that I have been hit hard,--so hard, that I have been\r\nnearly knocked down; but it will not hurt me now to hear of it all.\r\nDid she always love him?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot say. I think she did after her own fashion."\r\n\r\n"I sometimes think women would be less cruel," he said, "if they knew\r\nhow great is the anguish they can cause."\r\n\r\n"Has she been cruel to you?"\r\n\r\n"I have nothing to complain of. But if she loved Chiltern, why did\r\nshe not tell him so at once? And why--"\r\n\r\n"This is complaining, Mr. Finn."\r\n\r\n"I will not complain. I would not even think of it, if I could help\r\nit. Are they to be married soon?"\r\n\r\n"In July;--so they now say."\r\n\r\n"And where will they live?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! no one can tell. I do not think that they agree as yet as to\r\nthat. But if she has a strong wish Oswald will yield to it. He was\r\nalways generous."\r\n\r\n"I would not even have had a wish,--except to have her with me."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause for a moment, and then Lady Laura answered him with\r\na touch of scorn in her voice,--and with some scorn, too, in her\r\neye:--"That is all very well, Mr. Finn; but the season will not be\r\nover before there is some one else."\r\n\r\n"There you wrong me."\r\n\r\n"They tell me that you are already at Madame Goesler\'s feet."\r\n\r\n"Madame Goesler!"\r\n\r\n"What matters who it is as long as she is young and pretty, and\r\nhas the interest attached to her of something more than ordinary\r\nposition? When men tell me of the cruelty of women, I think that no\r\nwoman can be really cruel because no man is capable of suffering. A\r\nwoman, if she is thrown aside, does suffer."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to tell me, then, that I am indifferent to Miss\r\nEffingham?" When he thus spoke, I wonder whether he had forgotten\r\nthat he had ever declared to this very woman to whom he was speaking,\r\na passion for herself.\r\n\r\n"Psha!"\r\n\r\n"It suits you, Lady Laura, to be harsh to me, but you are not\r\nspeaking your thoughts."\r\n\r\nThen she lost all control of herself, and poured out to him the real\r\ntruth that was in her. "And whose thoughts did you speak when you and\r\nI were on the braes of Loughlinter? Am I wrong in saying that change\r\nis easy to you, or have I grown to be so old that you can talk to me\r\nas though those far-away follies ought to be forgotten? Was it so\r\nlong ago? Talk of love! I tell you, sir, that your heart is one in\r\nwhich love can have no durable hold. Violet Effingham! There may be\r\na dozen Violets after her, and you will be none the worse." Then she\r\nwalked away from him to the window, and he stood still, dumb, on the\r\nspot that he had occupied. "You had better go now," she said, "and\r\nforget what has passed between us. I know that you are a gentleman,\r\nand that you will forget it." The strong idea of his mind when he\r\nheard all this was the injustice of her attack,--of the attack as\r\ncoming from her, who had all but openly acknowledged that she had\r\nmarried a man whom she had not loved because it suited her to escape\r\nfrom a man whom she did love. She was reproaching him now for his\r\nfickleness in having ventured to set his heart upon another woman,\r\nwhen she herself had been so much worse than fickle,--so profoundly\r\nfalse! And yet he could not defend himself by accusing her. What\r\nwould she have had of him? What would she have proposed to him, had\r\nhe questioned her as to his future, when they were together on the\r\nbraes of Loughlinter? Would she not have bid him to find some one\r\nelse whom he could love? Would she then have suggested to him the\r\npropriety of nursing his love for herself,--for her who was about\r\nto become another man\'s wife,--for her after she should have become\r\nanother man\'s wife? And yet because he had not done so, and because\r\nshe had made herself wretched by marrying a man whom she did not\r\nlove, she reproached him!\r\n\r\nHe could not tell her of all this, so he fell back for his defence on\r\nwords which had passed between them since the day when they had met\r\non the braes. "Lady Laura," he said, "it is only a month or two since\r\nyou spoke to me as though you wished that Violet Effingham might be\r\nmy wife."\r\n\r\n"I never wished it. I never said that I wished it. There are moments\r\nin which we try to give a child any brick on the chimney top for\r\nwhich it may whimper." Then there was another silence which she was\r\nthe first to break. "You had better go," she said. "I know that I\r\nhave committed myself, and of course I would rather be alone."\r\n\r\n"And what would you wish that I should do?"\r\n\r\n"Do?" she said. "What you do can be nothing to me."\r\n\r\n"Must we be strangers, you and I, because there was a time in which\r\nwe were almost more than friends?"\r\n\r\n"I have spoken nothing about myself, sir,--only as I have been drawn\r\nto do so by your pretence of being love-sick. You can do nothing for\r\nme,--nothing,--nothing. What is it possible that you should do for\r\nme? You are not my father, or my brother." It is not to be supposed\r\nthat she wanted him to fall at her feet. It is to be supposed that\r\nhad he done so her reproaches would have been hot and heavy on\r\nhim; but yet it almost seemed to him as though he had no other\r\nalternative. No!--He was not her father or her brother;--nor could he\r\nbe her husband. And at this very moment, as she knew, his heart was\r\nsore with love for another woman. And yet he hardly knew how not to\r\nthrow himself at her feet, and swear, that he would return now and\r\nfor ever to his old passion, hopeless, sinful, degraded as it would\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n"I wish it were possible for me to do something," he said, drawing\r\nnear to her.\r\n\r\n"There is nothing to be done," she said, clasping her hands together.\r\n"For me nothing. I have before me no escape, no hope, no prospect of\r\nrelief, no place of consolation. You have everything before you. You\r\ncomplain of a wound! You have at least shown that such wounds with\r\nyou are capable of cure. You cannot but feel that when I hear your\r\nwailings, I must be impatient. You had better leave me now, if you\r\nplease."\r\n\r\n"And are we to be no longer friends?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"As far as friendship can go without intercourse, I shall always be\r\nyour friend."\r\n\r\nThen he went, and as he walked down to his office, so intent was he\r\non that which had just passed that he hardly saw the people as he\r\nmet them, or was aware of the streets through which his way led him.\r\nThere had been something in the later words which Lady Laura had\r\nspoken that had made him feel almost unconsciously that the injustice\r\nof her reproaches was not so great as he had at first felt it to be,\r\nand that she had some cause for her scorn. If her case was such as\r\nshe had so plainly described it, what was his plight as compared with\r\nhers? He had lost his Violet, and was in pain. There must be much\r\nof suffering before him. But though Violet were lost, the world was\r\nnot all blank before his eyes. He had not told himself, even in his\r\ndreariest moments, that there was before him "no escape, no hope, no\r\nprospect of relief, no place of consolation." And then he began to\r\nthink whether this must in truth be the case with Lady Laura. What if\r\nMr. Kennedy were to die? What in such case as that would he do? In\r\nten or perhaps in five years time might it not be possible for him\r\nto go through the ceremony of falling upon his knees, with stiffened\r\njoints indeed, but still with something left of the ardour of his old\r\nlove, of his oldest love of all?\r\n\r\nAs he was thinking of this he was brought up short in his walk as he\r\nwas entering the Green Park beneath the Duke\'s figure, by Laurence\r\nFitzgibbon. "How dare you not be in your office at such an hour as\r\nthis, Finn, me boy,--or, at least, not in the House,--or serving your\r\nmasters after some fashion?" said the late Under-Secretary.\r\n\r\n"So I am. I\'ve been on a message to Marylebone, to find what the\r\npeople there think about the Canadas."\r\n\r\n"And what do they think about the Canadas in Marylebone?"\r\n\r\n"Not one man in a thousand cares whether the Canadians prosper or\r\nfail to prosper. They care that Canada should not go to the States,\r\nbecause,--though they don\'t love the Canadians, they do hate the\r\nAmericans. That\'s about the feeling in Marylebone,--and it\'s\r\nastonishing how like the Maryleboners are to the rest of the world."\r\n\r\n"Dear me, what a fellow you are for an Under-Secretary! You\'ve heard\r\nthe news about little Violet."\r\n\r\n"What news?"\r\n\r\n"She has quarrelled with Chiltern, you know."\r\n\r\n"Who says so?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind who says so, but they tell me it\'s true. Take an old\r\nfriend\'s advice, and strike while the iron\'s hot."\r\n\r\nPhineas did not believe what he had heard, but though he did not\r\nbelieve it, still the tidings set his heart beating. He would have\r\nbelieved it less perhaps had he known that Laurence had just received\r\nthe news from Mrs. Bonteen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII\r\n\r\nThe Top Brick of the Chimney\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame Max Goesler was a lady who knew that in fighting the battles\r\nwhich fell to her lot, in arranging the social difficulties which she\r\nfound in her way, in doing the work of the world which came to her\r\nshare, very much more care was necessary,--and care too about things\r\napparently trifling,--than was demanded by the affairs of people in\r\ngeneral. And this was not the case so much on account of any special\r\ndisadvantage under which she laboured, as because she was ambitious\r\nof doing the very uttermost with those advantages which she\r\npossessed. Her own birth had not been high, and that of her husband,\r\nwe may perhaps say, had been very low. He had been old when she had\r\nmarried him, and she had had little power of making any progress till\r\nhe had left her a widow. Then she found herself possessed of money,\r\ncertainly; of wit,--as she believed; and of a something in her\r\npersonal appearance which, as she plainly told herself, she might\r\nperhaps palm off upon the world as beauty. She was a woman who did\r\nnot flatter herself, who did not strongly believe in herself, who\r\ncould even bring herself to wonder that men and women in high\r\nposition should condescend to notice such a one as her. With all her\r\nambition, there was a something of genuine humility about her; and\r\nwith all the hardness she had learned there was a touch of womanly\r\nsoftness which would sometimes obtrude itself upon her heart. When\r\nshe found a woman really kind to her, she would be very kind in\r\nreturn. And though she prized wealth, and knew that her money was her\r\nonly rock of strength, she could be lavish with it, as though it were\r\ndirt.\r\n\r\nBut she was highly ambitious, and she played her game with\r\ngreat skill and great caution. Her doors were not open to all\r\ncallers;--were shut even to some who find but few doors closed\r\nagainst them;--were shut occasionally to those whom she most\r\nspecially wished to see within them. She knew how to allure by\r\ndenying, and to make the gift rich by delaying it. We are told by the\r\nLatin proverb that he who gives quickly gives twice; but I say that\r\nshe who gives quickly seldom gives more than half. When in the early\r\nspring the Duke of Omnium first knocked at Madame Max Goesler\'s door,\r\nhe was informed that she was not at home. The Duke felt very cross as\r\nhe handed his card out from his dark green brougham,--on the panel\r\nof which there was no blazon to tell the owner\'s rank. He was very\r\ncross. She had told him that she was always at home between four and\r\nsix on a Thursday. He had condescended to remember the information,\r\nand had acted upon it,--and now she was not at home! She was not at\r\nhome, though he had come on a Thursday at the very hour she had named\r\nto him. Any duke would have been cross, but the Duke of Omnium was\r\nparticularly cross. No;--he certainly would give himself no further\r\ntrouble by going to the cottage in Park Lane. And yet Madame Max\r\nGoesler had been in her own drawing-room, while the Duke was handing\r\nout his card from the brougham below.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning there came to him a note from the cottage,--such\r\na pretty note!--so penitent, so full of remorse,--and, which was\r\nbetter still, so laden with disappointment, that he forgave her.\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR DUKE,\r\n\r\n   I hardly know how to apologise to you, after having told\r\n   you that I am always at home on Thursdays; and I was at\r\n   home yesterday when you called. But I was unwell, and I\r\n   had told the servant to deny me, not thinking how much I\r\n   might be losing. Indeed, indeed, I would not have given\r\n   way to a silly headache, had I thought that your Grace\r\n   would have been here. I suppose that now I must not even\r\n   hope for the photograph.\r\n\r\n   Yours penitently,\r\n\r\n   MARIE M. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe note-paper was very pretty note-paper, hardly scented, and yet\r\nconveying a sense of something sweet, and the monogram was small and\r\nnew, and fantastic without being grotesque, and the writing was of\r\nthat sort which the Duke, having much experience, had learned to\r\nlike,--and there was something in the signature which pleased him. So\r\nhe wrote a reply,--\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR MADAME MAX GOESLER,\r\n\r\n   I will call again next Thursday, or, if prevented, will\r\n   let you know.\r\n\r\n   Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n   O.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the green brougham drew up at the door of the cottage on the\r\nnext Thursday, Madame Goesler was at home, and had no headache.\r\n\r\nShe was not at all penitent now. She had probably studied the\r\nsubject, and had resolved that penitence was more alluring in a\r\nletter than when acted in person. She received her guest with perfect\r\nease, and apologised for the injury done to him in the preceding\r\nweek, with much self-complacency. "I was so sorry when I got your\r\ncard," she said; "and yet I am so glad now that you were refused."\r\n\r\n"If you were ill," said the Duke, "it was better."\r\n\r\n"I was horribly ill, to tell the truth;--as pale as a death\'s head,\r\nand without a word to say for myself. I was fit to see no one."\r\n\r\n"Then of course you were right."\r\n\r\n"But it flashed upon me immediately that I had named a day, and that\r\nyou had been kind enough to remember it. But I did not think you came\r\nto London till the March winds were over."\r\n\r\n"The March winds blow everywhere in this wretched island, Madame\r\nGoesler, and there is no escaping them. Youth may prevail against\r\nthem; but on me they are so potent that I think they will succeed in\r\ndriving me out of my country. I doubt whether an old man should ever\r\nlive in England if he can help it."\r\n\r\nThe Duke certainly was an old man, if a man turned of seventy be\r\nold;--and he was a man too who did not bear his years with hearty\r\nstrength. He moved slowly, and turned his limbs, when he did turn\r\nthem, as though the joints were stiff in their sockets. But there was\r\nnevertheless about him a dignity of demeanour, a majesty of person,\r\nand an upright carriage which did not leave an idea of old age as\r\nthe first impress on the minds of those who encountered the Duke of\r\nOmnium. He was tall and moved without a stoop; and though he moved\r\nslowly, he had learned to seem so to do because it was the proper\r\nkind of movement for one so high up in the world as himself. And\r\nperhaps his tailor did something for him. He had not been long under\r\nMadame Max Goesler\'s eyes before she perceived that his tailor had\r\ndone a good deal for him. When he alluded to his own age and to\r\nher youth, she said some pleasant little word as to the difference\r\nbetween oak-trees and currant-bushes; and by that time she was\r\nseated comfortably on her sofa, and the Duke was on a chair before\r\nher,--just as might have been any man who was not a Duke.\r\n\r\nAfter a little time the photograph was brought forth from his Grace\'s\r\npocket. That bringing out and giving of photographs, with the demand\r\nfor counter photographs, is the most absurd practice of the day.\r\n"I don\'t think I look very nice, do I?" "Oh yes,--very nice, but a\r\nlittle too old; and certainly you haven\'t got those spots all over\r\nyour forehead. These are the remarks which on such occasions are the\r\nmost common. It may be said that to give a photograph or to take a\r\nphotograph without the utterance of some words which would be felt by\r\na bystander to be absurd, is almost an impossibility. At this moment\r\nthere was no bystander, and therefore the Duke and the lady had no\r\nneed for caution. Words were spoken that were very absurd. Madame\r\nGoesler protested that the Duke\'s photograph was more to her than the\r\nphotographs of all the world beside; and the Duke declared that he\r\nwould carry the lady\'s picture next to his heart,--I am afraid he\r\nsaid for ever and ever. Then he took her hand and pressed it, and was\r\nconscious that for a man over seventy years of age he did that kind\r\nof thing very well.\r\n\r\n"You will come and dine with me, Duke?" she said, when he began to\r\ntalk of going.\r\n\r\n"I never dine out."\r\n\r\n"That is just the reason you should dine with me. You shall meet\r\nnobody you do not wish to meet."\r\n\r\n"I would so much rather see you in this way,--I would indeed. I do\r\ndine out occasionally, but it is at big formal parties, which I\r\ncannot escape without giving offence."\r\n\r\n"And you cannot escape my little not formal party,--without giving\r\noffence." She looked into his face as she spoke, and he knew that she\r\nmeant it. And he looked into hers, and thought that her eyes were\r\nbrighter than any he was in the habit of seeing in these latter days.\r\n"Name your own day, Duke. Will a Sunday suit you?"\r\n\r\n"If I must come--"\r\n\r\n"You must come." As she spoke her eyes sparkled more and more, and\r\nher colour went and came, and she shook her curls till they emitted\r\nthrough the air the same soft feeling of a perfume that her note had\r\nproduced. Then her foot peeped out from beneath the black and yellow\r\ndrapery of her dress, and the Duke saw that it was perfect. And she\r\nput out her finger and touched his arm as she spoke. Her hand was\r\nvery fair, and her fingers were bright with rich gems. To men such as\r\nthe Duke, a hand, to be quite fair, should be bright with rich gems.\r\n"You must come," she said,--not imploring him now but commanding him.\r\n\r\n"Then I will come," he answered, and a certain Sunday was fixed.\r\n\r\nThe arranging of the guests was a little difficulty, till Madame\r\nGoesler begged the Duke to bring with him Lady Glencora Palliser,\r\nhis nephew\'s wife. This at last he agreed to do. As the wife of his\r\nnephew and heir, Lady Glencora was to the Duke all that a woman could\r\nbe. She was everything that was proper as to her own conduct, and not\r\nobtrusive as to his. She did not bore him, and yet she was attentive.\r\nAlthough in her husband\'s house she was a fierce politician, in his\r\nhouse she was simply an attractive woman. "Ah; she is very clever,"\r\nthe Duke once said, "she adapts herself. If she were to go from any\r\none place to any other, she would be at home in both." And the\r\nmovement of his Grace\'s hand as he spoke seemed to indicate the\r\nwidest possible sphere for travelling and the widest possible\r\nscope for adaptation. The dinner was arranged, and went off very\r\npleasantly. Madame Goesler\'s eyes were not quite so bright as they\r\nwere during that morning visit, nor did she touch her guest\'s arm in\r\na manner so alluring. She was very quiet, allowing her guests to do\r\nmost of the talking. But the dinner and the flowers and the wine were\r\nexcellent, and the whole thing was so quiet that the Duke liked it.\r\n"And now you must come and dine with me," the Duke said as he took\r\nhis leave. "A command to that effect will be one which I certainly\r\nshall not disobey," whispered Madame Goesler.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid he is going to get fond of that woman." These words\r\nwere spoken early on the following morning by Lady Glencora to her\r\nhusband, Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\n"He is always getting fond of some woman, and he will to the end,"\r\nsaid Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\n"But this Madame Max Goesler is very clever."\r\n\r\n"So they tell me. I have generally thought that my uncle likes\r\ntalking to a fool the best."\r\n\r\n"Every man likes a clever woman the best," said Lady Glencora, "if\r\nthe clever woman only knows how to use her cleverness."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I hope he\'ll be amused," said Mr. Palliser innocently. "A\r\nlittle amusement is all that he cares for now."\r\n\r\n"Suppose you were told some day that he was going--to be married?"\r\nsaid Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"My uncle married!"\r\n\r\n"Why not he as well as another?"\r\n\r\n"And to Madame Goesler?"\r\n\r\n"If he be ever married it will be to some such woman."\r\n\r\n"There is not a man in all England who thinks more of his own\r\nposition than my uncle," said Mr. Palliser somewhat proudly,--almost\r\nwith a touch of anger.\r\n\r\n"That is all very well, Plantagenet, and true enough in a kind of\r\nway. But a child will sacrifice all that it has for the top brick\r\nof the chimney, and old men sometimes become children. You would\r\nnot like to be told some morning that there was a little Lord\r\nSilverbridge in the world." Now the eldest son of the Duke of\r\nOmnium, when the Duke of Omnium had a son, was called the Earl of\r\nSilverbridge; and Mr. Palliser, when this question was asked him,\r\nbecame very pale. Mr. Palliser knew well how thoroughly the cunning\r\nof the serpent was joined to the purity of the dove in the person\r\nof his wife, and he was sure that there was cause for fear when she\r\nhinted at danger.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you had better keep your eye upon him," he said to his wife.\r\n\r\n"And upon her," said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\nWhen Madame Goesler dined at the Duke\'s house in St. James\'s Square\r\nthere was a large party, and Lady Glencora knew that there was no\r\nneed for apprehension then. Indeed Madame Goesler was no more than\r\nany other guest, and the Duke hardly spoke to her. There was a\r\nDuchess there,--the Duchess of St. Bungay, and old Lady Hartletop,\r\nwho was a dowager marchioness,--an old lady who pestered the Duke\r\nvery sorely,--and Madame Max Goesler received her reward, and knew\r\nthat she was receiving it, in being asked to meet these people. Would\r\nnot all these names, including her own, be blazoned to the world in\r\nthe columns of the next day\'s _Morning Post_? There was no absolute\r\ndanger here, as Lady Glencora knew; and Lady Glencora, who was\r\ntolerant and begrudged nothing to Madame Max except the one thing,\r\nwas quite willing to meet the lady at such a grand affair as this.\r\nBut the Duke, even should he become ever so childish a child in his\r\nold age, still would have that plain green brougham at his command,\r\nand could go anywhere in that at any hour in the day. And then\r\nMadame Goesler was so manifestly a clever woman. A Duchess of Omnium\r\nmight be said to fill,--in the estimation, at any rate, of English\r\npeople,--the highest position in the world short of royalty. And the\r\nreader will remember that Lady Glencora intended to be a Duchess of\r\nOmnium herself,--unless some very unexpected event should intrude\r\nitself. She intended also that her little boy, her fair-haired,\r\ncurly-pated, bold-faced little boy, should be Earl of Silverbridge\r\nwhen the sand of the old man should have run itself out. Heavens,\r\nwhat a blow would it be, should some little wizen-cheeked half-monkey\r\nbaby, with black brows, and yellow skin, be brought forward and shown\r\nto her some day as the heir! What a blow to herself;--and what a blow\r\nto all England! "We can\'t prevent it if he chooses to do it," said\r\nher husband, who had his budget to bring forward that very night, and\r\nwho in truth cared more for his budget than he did for his heirship\r\nat that moment. "But we must prevent it," said Lady Glencora. "If I\r\nstick to him by the tail of his coat, I\'ll prevent it." At the time\r\nwhen she thus spoke, the dark green brougham had been twice again\r\nbrought up at the door in Park Lane.\r\n\r\nAnd the brougham was standing there a third time. It was May now, the\r\nlatter end of May, and the park opposite was beautiful with green\r\nthings, and the air was soft and balmy, as it will be sometimes even\r\nin May, and the flowers in the balcony were full of perfume, and the\r\ncharm of London,--what London can be to the rich,--was at its height.\r\nThe Duke was sitting in Madame Goesler\'s drawing-room, at some\r\ndistance from her, for she had retreated. The Duke had a habit\r\nof taking her hand, which she never would permit for above a few\r\nseconds. At such times she would show no anger, but would retreat.\r\n\r\n"Marie," said the Duke, "you will go abroad when the summer is over."\r\nAs an old man he had taken the privilege of calling her Marie, and\r\nshe had not forbidden it.\r\n\r\nYes, probably; to Vienna. I have property in Vienna you know, which\r\nmust be looked after.\r\n\r\n"Do not mind Vienna this year. Come to Italy."\r\n\r\n"What; in summer, Duke?"\r\n\r\n"The lakes are charming in August. I have a villa on Como which is\r\nempty now, and I think I shall go there. If you do not know the\r\nItalian lakes, I shall be so happy to show them to you."\r\n\r\n"I know them well, my lord. When I was young I was on the Maggiore\r\nalmost alone. Some day I will tell you a history of what I was in\r\nthose days."\r\n\r\n"You shall tell it me there."\r\n\r\n"No, my lord, I fear not. I have no villa there."\r\n\r\n"Will you not accept the loan of mine? It shall be all your own while\r\nyou use it."\r\n\r\n"My own,--to deny the right of entrance to its owner?"\r\n\r\n"If it so pleases you."\r\n\r\n"It would not please me. It would so far from please me that I will\r\nnever put myself in a position that might make it possible for me to\r\nrequire to do so. No, Duke; it behoves me to live in houses of my\r\nown. Women of whom more is known can afford to be your guests."\r\n\r\n"Marie, I would have no other guest than you."\r\n\r\n"It cannot be so, Duke."\r\n\r\n"And why not?"\r\n\r\n"Why not? Am I to be put to the blush by being made to answer such a\r\nquestion as that? Because the world would say that the Duke of Omnium\r\nhad a new mistress, and that Madame Goesler was the woman. Do you\r\nthink that I would be any man\'s mistress;--even yours? Or do you\r\nbelieve that for the sake of the softness of a summer evening on an\r\nItalian lake, I would give cause to the tongues of the women here to\r\nsay that I was such a thing? You would have me lose all that I have\r\ngained by steady years of sober work for the sake of a week or two of\r\ndalliance such as that! No, Duke; not for your dukedom!"\r\n\r\nHow his Grace might have got through his difficulty had they been\r\nleft alone, cannot be told. For at this moment the door was opened,\r\nand Lady Glencora Palliser was announced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII\r\n\r\nRara Avis in Terris\r\n\r\n\r\n"Come and see the country and judge for yourself," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"I should like nothing better," said Mr. Monk.\r\n\r\n"It has often seemed to me that men in Parliament know less about\r\nIreland than they do of the interior of Africa," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"It is seldom that we know anything accurately on any subject that\r\nwe have not made matter of careful study," said Mr. Monk, "and very\r\noften do not do so even then. We are very apt to think that we men\r\nand women understand one another; but most probably you know nothing\r\neven of the modes of thought of the man who lives next door to you."\r\n\r\n"I suppose not."\r\n\r\n"There are general laws current in the world as to morality. \'Thou\r\nshalt not steal,\' for instance. That has necessarily been current as\r\na law through all nations. But the first man you meet in the street\r\nwill have ideas about theft so different from yours, that, if you\r\nknew them as you know your own, you would say that this law and yours\r\nwere not even founded on the same principle. It is compatible with\r\nthis man\'s honesty to cheat you in a matter of horseflesh, with that\r\nman\'s in a traffic of railway shares, with that other man\'s as to a\r\nwoman\'s fortune; with a fourth\'s anything may be done for a seat in\r\nParliament, while the fifth man, who stands high among us, and who\r\nimplores his God every Sunday to write that law on his heart, spends\r\nevery hour of his daily toil in a system of fraud, and is regarded as\r\na pattern of the national commerce!"\r\n\r\nMr. Monk and Phineas were dining together at Mr. Monk\'s house, and\r\nthe elder politician of the two in this little speech had recurred to\r\ncertain matters which had already been discussed between them. Mr.\r\nMonk was becoming somewhat sick of his place in the Cabinet, though\r\nhe had not as yet whispered a word of his sickness to any living\r\nears; and he had begun to pine for the lost freedom of a seat below\r\nthe gangway. He had been discussing political honesty with Phineas,\r\nand hence had come the sermon of which I have ventured to reproduce\r\nthe concluding denunciations.\r\n\r\nPhineas was fond of such discussions and fond of holding them with\r\nMr. Monk,--in this matter fluttering like a moth round a candle. He\r\nwould not perceive that as he had made up his mind to be a servant\r\nof the public in Parliament, he must abandon all idea of independent\r\naction; and unless he did so he could be neither successful as\r\nregarded himself, or useful to the public whom he served. Could a man\r\nbe honest in Parliament, and yet abandon all idea of independence?\r\nWhen he put such questions to Mr. Monk he did not get a direct\r\nanswer. And indeed the question was never put directly. But the\r\nteaching which he received was ever of a nature to make him uneasy.\r\nIt was always to this effect: "You have taken up the trade now, and\r\nseem to be fit for success in it. You had better give up thinking\r\nabout its special honesty." And yet Mr. Monk would on an occasion\r\npreach to him such a sermon as that which he had just uttered!\r\nPerhaps there is no question more difficult to a man\'s mind than that\r\nof the expediency or inexpediency of scruples in political life.\r\nWhether would a candidate for office be more liable to rejection from\r\na leader because he was known to be scrupulous, or because he was\r\nknown to be the reverse?\r\n\r\n"But putting aside the fourth commandment and all the theories, you\r\nwill come to Ireland?" said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"I shall be delighted."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t live in a castle, you know."\r\n\r\n"I thought everybody did live in a castle in Ireland," said Mr. Monk.\r\n"They seemed to do when I was there twenty years ago. But for myself,\r\nI prefer a cottage."\r\n\r\nThis trip to Ireland had been proposed in consequence of certain\r\nideas respecting tenant-right which Mr. Monk was beginning to adopt,\r\nand as to which the minds of politicians were becoming moved. It\r\nhad been all very well to put down Fenianism, and Ribandmen, and\r\nRepeal,--and everything that had been put down in Ireland in the way\r\nof rebellion for the last seventy-five years. England and Ireland\r\nhad been apparently joined together by laws of nature so fixed,\r\nthat even politicians liberal as was Mr. Monk,--liberal as was Mr.\r\nTurnbull,--could not trust themselves to think that disunion could\r\nbe for the good of the Irish. They had taught themselves that it\r\ncertainly could not be good for the English. But if it was incumbent\r\non England to force upon Ireland the maintenance of the Union for her\r\nown sake, and for England\'s sake, because England could not afford\r\nindependence established so close against her own ribs,--it was at\r\nany rate necessary to England\'s character that the bride thus\r\nbound in a compulsory wedlock should be endowed with all the best\r\nprivileges that a wife can enjoy. Let her at least not be a kept\r\nmistress. Let it be bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh, if we\r\nare to live together in the married state. Between husband and\r\nwife a warm word now and then matters but little, if there be a\r\nthoroughly good understanding at bottom. But let there be that good\r\nunderstanding at bottom. What about this Protestant Church; and what\r\nabout this tenant-right? Mr. Monk had been asking himself these\r\nquestions for some time past. In regard to the Church, he had long\r\nmade up his mind that the Establishment in Ireland was a crying sin.\r\nA man had married a woman whom he knew to be of a religion different\r\nfrom his own, and then insisted that his wife should say that she\r\nbelieved those things which he knew very well that she did not\r\nbelieve. But, as Mr. Monk well knew, the subject of the Protestant\r\nEndowments in Ireland was so difficult that it would require almost\r\nmore than human wisdom to adjust it. It was one of those matters\r\nwhich almost seemed to require the interposition of some higher\r\npower,--the coming of some apparently chance event,--to clear away\r\nthe evil; as a fire comes, and pestilential alleys are removed; as a\r\nfamine comes, and men are driven from want and ignorance and dirt to\r\nseek new homes and new thoughts across the broad waters; as a war\r\ncomes, and slavery is banished from the face of the earth. But in\r\nregard to tenant-right, to some arrangement by which a tenant in\r\nIreland might be at least encouraged to lay out what little capital\r\nhe might have in labour or money without being at once called upon to\r\npay rent for that outlay which was his own, as well as for the land\r\nwhich was not his own,--Mr. Monk thought that it was possible that if\r\na man would look hard enough he might perhaps be able to see his way\r\nas to that. He had spoken to two of his colleagues on the subject,\r\nthe two men in the Cabinet whom he believed to be the most thoroughly\r\nhonest in their ideas as public servants, the Duke and Mr. Gresham.\r\nThere was so much to be done;--and then so little was known upon the\r\nsubject! "I will endeavour to study it," said Mr. Monk. "If you can\r\nsee your way, do;" said Mr. Gresham,--"but of course we cannot bind\r\nourselves." "I should be glad to see it named in the Queen\'s speech\r\nat the beginning of the next session," said Mr. Monk. "That is a long\r\nway off as yet," said Mr. Gresham, laughing. "Who will be in then,\r\nand who will be out?" So the matter was disposed of at the time, but\r\nMr. Monk did not abandon his idea. He rather felt himself the more\r\nbound to cling to it because he received so little encouragement.\r\nWhat was a seat in the Cabinet to him that he should on that account\r\nomit a duty? He had not taken up politics as a trade. He had sat\r\nfar behind the Treasury bench or below the gangway for many a year,\r\nwithout owing any man a shilling,--and could afford to do so again.\r\n\r\nBut it was different with Phineas Finn, as Mr. Monk himself\r\nunderstood;--and, understanding this, he felt himself bound to\r\ncaution his young friend. But it may be a question whether his\r\ncautions did not do more harm than good. "I shall be delighted," he\r\nsaid, "to go over with you in August, but I do not think that if I\r\nwere you, I would take up this matter."\r\n\r\n"And why not? You don\'t want to fight the battle singlehanded?"\r\n\r\n"No; I desire no such glory, and would wish to have no better\r\nlieutenant than you. But you have a subject of which you are really\r\nfond, which you are beginning to understand, and in regard to which\r\nyou can make yourself useful."\r\n\r\n"You mean this Canada business?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--and that will grow to other matters as regards the colonies.\r\nThere is nothing so important to a public man as that he should have\r\nhis own subject;--the thing which he understands, and in respect of\r\nwhich he can make himself really useful."\r\n\r\n"Then there comes a change."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--and the man who has half learned how to have a ship built\r\nwithout waste is sent into opposition, and is then brought back\r\nto look after regiments, or perhaps has to take up that beautiful\r\nsubject, a study of the career of India. But, nevertheless, if you\r\nhave a subject, stick to it at any rate as long as it will stick to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"But," said Phineas, "if a man takes up his own subject, independent\r\nof the Government, no man can drive him from it."\r\n\r\n"And how often does he do anything? Look at the annual motions which\r\ncome forward in the hands of private men,--Maynooth and the ballot\r\nfor instance. It is becoming more and more apparent every day that\r\nall legislation must be carried by the Government, and must be\r\ncarried in obedience to the expressed wish of the people. The truest\r\ndemocracy that ever had a chance of living is that which we are now\r\nestablishing in Great Britain."\r\n\r\n"Then leave tenant-right to the people and the Cabinet. Why should\r\nyou take it up?"\r\n\r\nMr. Monk paused a moment or two before he replied. "If I choose to\r\nrun a-muck, there is no reason why you should follow me. I am old and\r\nyou are young. I want nothing from politics as a profession, and you\r\ndo. Moreover, you have a congenial subject where you are, and need\r\nnot disturb yourself. For myself, I tell you, in confidence, that I\r\ncannot speak so comfortably of my own position."\r\n\r\n"We will go and see, at any rate," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mr. Monk, "we will go and see." And thus, in the month of\r\nMay, it was settled between them that, as soon as the session should\r\nbe over, and the incidental work of his office should allow Phineas\r\nto pack up and be off, they two should start together for Ireland.\r\nPhineas felt rather proud as he wrote to his father and asked\r\npermission to bring home with him a Cabinet Minister as a visitor. At\r\nthis time the reputation of Phineas at Killaloe, as well in the minds\r\nof the Killaloeians generally as in those of the inhabitants of the\r\npaternal house, stood very high indeed. How could a father think that\r\na son had done badly when before he was thirty years of age he was\r\nearning L2,000 a year? And how could a father not think well of a\r\nson who had absolutely paid back certain moneys into the paternal\r\ncoffers? The moneys so repaid had not been much; but the repayment\r\nof any such money at Killaloe had been regarded as little short of\r\nmiraculous. The news of Mr. Monk\'s coming flew about the town, about\r\nthe county, about the diocese, and all people began to say all good\r\nthings about the old doctor\'s only son. Mrs. Finn had long since\r\nbeen quite sure that a real black swan had been sent forth out of\r\nher nest. And the sisters Finn, for some time past, had felt in\r\nall social gatherings they stood quite on a different footing than\r\nformerly because of their brother. They were asked about in the\r\ncounty, and two of them had been staying only last Easter with the\r\nMolonys,--the Molonys of Poldoodie! How should a father and a mother\r\nand sisters not be grateful to such a son, to such a brother, to such\r\na veritable black swan out of the nest! And as for dear little Mary\r\nFlood Jones, her eyes became suffused with tears as in her solitude\r\nshe thought how much out of her reach this swan was flying. And yet\r\nshe took joy in his swanhood, and swore that she would love him\r\nstill;--that she would love him always. Might he bring home with him\r\nto Killaloe, Mr. Monk, the Cabinet Minister! Of course he might. When\r\nMrs. Finn first heard of this august arrival, she felt as though she\r\nwould like to expend herself in entertaining, though but an hour, the\r\nwhole cabinet.\r\n\r\nPhineas, during the spring, had, of course, met Mr. Kennedy\r\nfrequently in and about the House, and had become aware that Lady\r\nLaura\'s husband, from time to time, made little overtures of civility\r\nto him,--taking him now and again by the button-hole, walking home\r\nwith him as far as their joint paths allowed, and asking him once\r\nor twice to come and dine in Grosvenor Place. These little advances\r\ntowards a repetition of the old friendship Phineas would have avoided\r\naltogether, had it been possible. The invitation to Mr. Kennedy\'s\r\nhouse he did refuse, feeling himself positively bound to do so by\r\nLady Laura\'s command, let the consequences be what they might. When\r\nhe did refuse, Mr. Kennedy would assume a look of displeasure and\r\nleave him, and Phineas would hope that the work was done. Then there\r\nwould come another encounter, and the invitation would be repeated.\r\nAt last, about the middle of May, there came another note. "Dear\r\nFinn, will you dine with us on Wednesday, the 28th? I give you a long\r\nnotice, because you seem to have so many appointments. Yours always,\r\nRobert Kennedy." He had no alternative. He must refuse, even though\r\ndouble the notice had been given. He could only think that Mr.\r\nKennedy was a very obtuse man and one who would not take a hint,\r\nand hope that he might succeed at last. So he wrote an answer, not\r\nintended to be conciliatory. "My dear Kennedy, I am sorry to say that\r\nI am engaged on the 28th. Yours always, Phineas Finn." At this period\r\nhe did his best to keep out of Mr. Kennedy\'s way, and would be very\r\ncunning in his manoeuvres that they should not be alone together.\r\nIt was difficult, as they sat on the same bench in the House,\r\nand consequently saw each other almost every day of their lives.\r\nNevertheless, he thought that with a little cunning he might prevail,\r\nespecially as he was not unwilling to give so much of offence as\r\nmight assist his own object. But when Mr. Kennedy called upon him at\r\nhis office the day after he had written the above note, he had no\r\nmeans of escape.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry you cannot come to us on the 28th," Mr. Kennedy said, as\r\nsoon as he was seated.\r\n\r\nPhineas was taken so much by surprise that all his cunning failed\r\nhim. "Well, yes," said he; "I was very sorry;--very sorry indeed."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me, Finn, that you have had some reason for avoiding me\r\nof late. I do not know that I have done anything to offend you."\r\n\r\n"Nothing on earth," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"I am wrong, then, in supposing that anything beyond mere chance has\r\nprevented you from coming to my house?" Phineas felt that he was in\r\na terrible difficulty, and he felt also that he was being rather\r\nill-used in being thus cross-examined as to his reasons for not going\r\nto a gentleman\'s dinner. He thought that a man ought to be allowed\r\nto choose where he would go and where he would not go, and that\r\nquestions such as these were very uncommon. Mr. Kennedy was sitting\r\nopposite to him, looking more grave and more sour than usual;--and\r\nnow his own countenance also became a little solemn. It was\r\nimpossible that he should use Lady Laura\'s name, and yet he must, in\r\nsome way, let his persecuting friend know that no further invitation\r\nwould be of any use;--that there was something beyond mere chance\r\nin his not going to Grosvenor Place. But how was he to do this? The\r\ndifficulty was so great that he could not see his way out of it. So\r\nhe sat silent with a solemn face. Mr. Kennedy then asked him another\r\nquestion, which made the difficulty ten times greater. "Has my wife\r\nasked you not to come to our house?"\r\n\r\nIt was necessary now that he should make a rush and get out of his\r\ntrouble in some way. "To tell you the truth, Kennedy, I don\'t think\r\nshe wants to see me there."\r\n\r\n"That does not answer my question. Has she asked you not to come?"\r\n\r\n"She said that which left on my mind an impression that she would\r\nsooner that I did not come."\r\n\r\n"What did she say?"\r\n\r\n"How can I answer such a question as that, Kennedy? Is it fair to ask\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"Quite fair,--I think."\r\n\r\n"I think it quite unfair, and I must decline to answer it. I cannot\r\nimagine what you expect to gain by cross-questioning me in this way.\r\nOf course no man likes to go to a house if he does not believe that\r\neverybody there will make him welcome."\r\n\r\n"You and Lady Laura used to be great friends."\r\n\r\n"I hope we are not enemies now. But things will occur that cause\r\nfriendships to grow cool."\r\n\r\n"Have you quarrelled with her father?"\r\n\r\n"With Lord Brentford?--no."\r\n\r\n"Or with her brother,--since the duel I mean?"\r\n\r\n"Upon my word and honour I cannot stand this, and I will not. I have\r\nnot as yet quarrelled with anybody; but I must quarrel with you, if\r\nyou go on in this way. It is quite unusual that a man should be put\r\nthrough his facings after such a fashion, and I must beg that there\r\nmay be an end of it."\r\n\r\n"Then I must ask Lady Laura."\r\n\r\n"You can say what you like to your own wife of course. I cannot\r\nhinder you."\r\n\r\nUpon that Mr. Kennedy formally shook hands with him, in token that\r\nthere was no positive breach between them,--as two nations may still\r\nmaintain their alliance, though they have made up their minds to hate\r\neach other, and thwart each other at every turn,--and took his leave.\r\nPhineas, as he sat at his window, looking out into the park, and\r\nthinking of what had passed, could not but reflect that, disagreeable\r\nas Mr. Kennedy had been to him, he would probably make himself much\r\nmore disagreeable to his wife. And, for himself, he thought that he\r\nhad got out of the scrape very well by the exhibition of a little\r\nmock anger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX\r\n\r\nThe Earl\'s Wrath\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader may remember that a rumour had been conveyed to\r\nPhineas,--a rumour indeed which reached him from a source which he\r\nregarded as very untrustworthy,--that Violet Effingham had quarrelled\r\nwith her lover. He would probably have paid no attention to the\r\nrumour, beyond that which necessarily attached itself to any tidings\r\nas to a matter so full of interest to him, had it not been repeated\r\nto him in another quarter. "A bird has told me that your Violet\r\nEffingham has broken with her lover," Madame Goesler said to him one\r\nday. "What bird?" he asked. "Ah, that I cannot tell you. But this I\r\nwill confess to you, that these birds which tell us news are seldom\r\nvery credible,--and are often not very creditable, You must take\r\na bird\'s word for what it may be worth. It is said that they have\r\nquarrelled. I daresay, if the truth were known, they are billing and\r\ncooing in each other\'s arms at this moment."\r\n\r\nPhineas did not like to be told of their billing and cooing,--did\r\nnot like to be told even of their quarrelling. Though they were to\r\nquarrel, it would do him no good. He would rather that nobody should\r\nmention their names to him;--so that his back, which had been so\r\nutterly broken, might in process of time get itself cured. From what\r\nhe knew of Violet he thought it very improbable that, even were\r\nshe to quarrel with one lover, she would at once throw herself into\r\nthe arms of another. And he did feel, too, that there would be\r\nsome meanness in taking her, were she willing to be so taken. But,\r\nnevertheless, these rumours, coming to him in this way from different\r\nsources, almost made it incumbent on him to find out the truth. He\r\nbegan to think that his broken back was not cured;--that perhaps,\r\nafter all, it was not in the way of being cured, And was it not\r\npossible that there might be explanations? Then he went to work\r\nand built castles in the air, so constructed as to admit of the\r\npossibility of Violet Effingham becoming his wife.\r\n\r\nThis had been in April, and at that time all that he knew of Violet\r\nwas, that she was not yet in London. And he thought that he knew the\r\nsame as to Lord Chiltern. The Earl had told him that Chiltern was not\r\nin town, nor expected in town as yet; and in saying so had seemed to\r\nexpress displeasure against his son. Phineas had met Lady Baldock at\r\nsome house which he frequented, and had been quite surprised to find\r\nhimself graciously received by the old woman. She had said not a word\r\nof Violet, but had spoken of Lord Chiltern,--mentioning his name in\r\nbitter wrath. "But he is a friend of mine," said Phineas, smiling.\r\n"A friend indeed! Mr. Finn. I know what sort of a friend. I don\'t\r\nbelieve that you are his friend. I am afraid he is not worthy of\r\nhaving any friend." Phineas did not quite understand from this\r\nthat Lady Baldock was signifying to him that, badly as she had\r\nthought of him as a suitor for her niece, she would have preferred\r\nhim,--especially now when people were beginning to speak well of\r\nhim,--to that terrible young man, who, from his youth upwards, had\r\nbeen to her a cause of fear and trembling. Of course it was desirable\r\nthat Violet should marry an elder son, and a peer\'s heir. All that\r\nkind of thing, in Lady Baldock\'s eyes, was most desirable. But,\r\nnevertheless, anything was better than Lord Chiltern. If Violet would\r\nnot take Mr. Appledom or Lord Fawn, in heaven\'s name let her take\r\nthis young man, who was kind, worthy, and steady, who was civilised\r\nin his manners, and would no doubt be amenable in regard to\r\nsettlements. Lady Baldock had so far fallen in the world that she\r\nwould have consented to make a bargain with her niece,--almost any\r\nbargain, so long as Lord Chiltern was excluded. Phineas did not quite\r\nunderstand all this; but when Lady Baldock asked him to come to\r\nBerkeley Square, he perceived that help was being proffered to him\r\nwhere he certainly had not looked for help.\r\n\r\nHe was frequently with Lord Brentford, who talked to him constantly\r\non matters connected with his parliamentary life. After having been\r\nthe intimate friend of the daughter and of the son, it now seemed\r\nto be his lot to be the intimate friend of the father. The Earl\r\nhad constantly discussed with him his arrangements with his son,\r\nand had lately expressed himself as only half satisfied with such\r\nreconciliation as had taken place. And Phineas could perceive that\r\nfrom day to day the Earl was less and less satisfied. He would\r\ncomplain bitterly of his son,--complain of his silence, complain of\r\nhis not coming to London, complain of his conduct to Violet, complain\r\nof his idle indifference to anything like proper occupation; but he\r\nhad never as yet said a word to show that there had been any quarrel\r\nbetween Violet and her lover, and Phineas had felt that he could not\r\nask the question. "Mr. Finn," said the Earl to him one morning, as\r\nsoon as he entered the room, "I have just heard a story which has\r\nalmost seemed to me to be incredible." The nobleman\'s manner was very\r\nstern, and the fact that he called his young friend "Mr. Finn",\r\nshowed at once that something was wrong.\r\n\r\n"What is it you have heard, my lord?" said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"That you and Chiltern went over,--last year to,--Belgium, and\r\nfought,--a duel there!"\r\n\r\nNow it must have been the case that, in the set among which they\r\nall lived,--Lord Brentford and his son and daughter and Phineas\r\nFinn,--the old lord was the only man who had not heard of the duel\r\nbefore this. It had even penetrated to the dull ears of Mr. Kennedy,\r\nreminding him, as it did so, that his wife had,--told him a lie! But\r\nit was the fact that no rumour of the duel had reached the Earl till\r\nthis morning.\r\n\r\n"It is true," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"I have never been so much shocked in my life;--never. I had no idea\r\nthat you had any thought of aspiring to the hand of Miss Effingham."\r\nThe lord\'s voice as he said this was very stern.\r\n\r\n"As I aspired in vain, and as Chiltern has been successful, that need\r\nnot now be made a reproach against me."\r\n\r\n"I do not know what to think of it, Mr. Finn. I am so much surprised\r\nthat I hardly know what to say. I must declare my opinion at once,\r\nthat you behaved,--very badly."\r\n\r\n"I do not know how much you know, my lord, and how much you do not\r\nknow; and the circumstances of the little affair do not permit me to\r\nbe explicit about them; but, as you have expressed your opinion so\r\nopenly you must allow me to express mine, and to say that, as far as\r\nI can judge of my own actions, I did not behave badly at all."\r\n\r\n"Do you intend to defend duelling, sir?"\r\n\r\n"No. If you mean to tell me that a duel is of itself sinful, I have\r\nnothing to say. I suppose it is. My defence of myself merely goes to\r\nthe manner in which this duel was fought, and the fact that I fought\r\nit with your son."\r\n\r\n"I cannot conceive how you can have come to my house as my guest,\r\nand stood upon my interest for my borough, when you at the time were\r\ndoing your very best to interpose yourself between Chiltern and the\r\nlady whom you so well knew I wished to become his wife." Phineas was\r\naware that the Earl must have been very much moved indeed when he\r\nthus permitted himself to speak of "his" borough. He said nothing\r\nnow, however, though the Earl paused;--and then the angry lord\r\nwent on. "I must say that there was something,--something almost\r\napproaching to duplicity in such conduct."\r\n\r\n"If I were to defend myself by evidence, Lord Brentford, I should\r\nhave to go back to exact dates,--and dates not of facts which I could\r\nverify, but dates as to my feelings which could not be verified,--and\r\nthat would be useless. I can only say that I believe I know what\r\nthe honour and truth of a gentleman demand,--even to the verge of\r\nself-sacrifice, and that I have done nothing that ought to place my\r\ncharacter as a gentleman in jeopardy. If you will ask your son, I\r\nthink he will tell you the same."\r\n\r\n"I have asked him. It was he who told me of the duel."\r\n\r\n"When did he tell you, my lord?"\r\n\r\n"Just now; this morning." Thus Phineas learned that Lord Chiltern was\r\nat this moment in the house,--or at least in London.\r\n\r\n"And did he complain of my conduct?"\r\n\r\n"I complain of it, sir. I complain of it very bitterly. I placed the\r\ngreatest confidence in you, especially in regard to my son\'s affairs,\r\nand you deceived me." The Earl was very angry, and was more angry\r\nfrom the fact that this young man who had offended him, to whom he\r\nhad given such vital assistance when assistance was needed, had used\r\nthat assistance to its utmost before his sin was found out. Had\r\nPhineas still been sitting for Loughton, so that the Earl could have\r\nsaid to him, "You are now bound to retreat from this borough because\r\nyou have offended me, your patron," I think that he would have\r\nforgiven the offender and allowed him to remain in his seat. There\r\nwould have been a scene, and the Earl would have been pacified. But\r\nnow the offender was beyond his reach altogether, having used the\r\nborough as a most convenient stepping-stone over his difficulties,\r\nand having so used it just at the time when he was committing this\r\nsin. There was a good fortune about Phineas which added greatly to\r\nthe lord\'s wrath. And then, to tell the truth, he had not that rich\r\nconsolation for which Phineas gave him credit. Lord Chiltern had told\r\nhim that morning that the engagement between him and Violet was at an\r\nend. "You have so preached to her, my lord, about my duties," the son\r\nhad said to his father, "that she finds herself obliged to give me\r\nyour sermons at second hand, till I can bear them no longer." But of\r\nthis Phineas knew nothing as yet. The Earl, however, was so imprudent\r\nin his anger that before this interview was over he had told the\r\nwhole story. "Yes;--you deceived me," he continued; "and I can never\r\ntrust you again."\r\n\r\n"Was it for me, my lord, to tell you of that which would have\r\nincreased your anger against your own son? When he wanted me to fight\r\nwas I to come, like a sneak at school, and tell you the story? I know\r\nwhat you would have thought of me had I done so. And when it was over\r\nwas I to come and tell you then? Think what you yourself would have\r\ndone when you were young, and you may be quite sure that I did the\r\nsame. What have I gained? He has got all that he wanted; and you\r\nhave also got all that you wanted;--and I have helped you both. Lord\r\nBrentford, I can put my hand on my heart and say that I have been\r\nhonest to you."\r\n\r\n"I have got nothing that I wanted," said the Earl in his despair.\r\n\r\n"Lord Chiltern and Miss Effingham will be man and wife."\r\n\r\n"No;--they will not. He has quarrelled with her. He is so obstinate\r\nthat she will not bear with him."\r\n\r\nThen it was all true, even though the rumours had reached him through\r\nLaurence Fitzgibbon and Madame Max Goesler. "At any rate, my lord,\r\nthat has not been my fault," he said, after a moment\'s hesitation.\r\nThe Earl was walking up and down the room, angry with himself at his\r\nown mistake in having told the story, and not knowing what further to\r\nsay to his visitor. He had been in the habit of talking so freely to\r\nPhineas about his son that he could hardly resist the temptation of\r\ndoing so still; and yet it was impossible that he could swallow his\r\nanger and continue in the same strain. "My lord," said Phineas, after\r\na while, "I can assure you that I grieve that you should be grieved.\r\nI have received so much undeserved favour from your family, that I\r\nowe you a debt which I can never pay. I am sorry that you should be\r\nangry with me now; but I hope that a time may come when you will\r\nthink less severely of my conduct."\r\n\r\nHe was about to leave the room when the Earl stopped him. "Will you\r\ngive me your word," said the Earl, "that you will think no more of\r\nMiss Effingham?" Phineas stood silent, considering how he might\r\nanswer this proposal, resolving that nothing should bring him to such\r\na pledge as that suggested while there was yet a ledge for hope to\r\nstand on. "Say that, Mr. Finn, and I will forgive everything."\r\n\r\n"I cannot acknowledge that I have done anything to be forgiven."\r\n\r\n"Say that," repeated the Earl, "and everything shall be forgotten."\r\n\r\n"There need be no cause for alarm, my lord," said Phineas. "You may\r\nbe sure that Miss Effingham will not think of me."\r\n\r\n"Will you give me your word?"\r\n\r\n"No, my lord;--certainly not. You have no right to ask it, and the\r\npursuit is open to me as to any other man who may choose to follow\r\nit. I have hardly a vestige of a hope of success. It is barely\r\npossible that I should succeed. But if it be true that Miss Effingham\r\nbe disengaged, I shall endeavour to find an opportunity of urging my\r\nsuit. I would give up everything that I have, my seat in Parliament,\r\nall the ambition of my life, for the barest chance of success. When\r\nshe had accepted your son, I desisted,--of course. I have now heard,\r\nfrom more sources than one, that she or he or both of them have\r\nchanged their minds. If this be so, I am free to try again." The\r\nEarl stood opposite to him, scowling at him, but said nothing. "Good\r\nmorning, my lord."\r\n\r\n"Good morning, sir."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid it must be good-bye, for some long days to come."\r\n\r\n"Good morning, sir," And the Earl as he spoke rang the bell. Then\r\nPhineas took up his hat and departed.\r\n\r\nAs he walked away his mind filled itself gradually with various\r\nideas, all springing from the words which Lord Brentford had spoken.\r\nWhat account had Lord Chiltern given to his father of the duel? Our\r\nhero was a man very sensitive as to the good opinion of others, and\r\nin spite of his bold assertion of his own knowledge of what became\r\na gentleman, was beyond measure solicitous that others should\r\nacknowledge his claim at any rate to that title. He thought that he\r\nhad been generous to Lord Chiltern; and as he went back in his memory\r\nover almost every word that had been spoken in the interview that had\r\njust passed, he fancied that he was able to collect evidence that his\r\nantagonist at Blankenberg had not spoken ill of him. As to the charge\r\nof deceit which the Earl had made against him, he told himself that\r\nthe Earl had made it in anger. He would not even think hardly of the\r\nEarl who had been so good a friend to him, but he believed in his\r\nheart that the Earl had made the accusation out of his wrath and not\r\nout of his judgment. "He cannot think that I have been false to him,"\r\nPhineas said to himself. But it was very sad to him that he should\r\nhave to quarrel with all the family of the Standishes, as he could\r\nnot but feel that it was they who had put him on his feet. It seemed\r\nas though he were never to see Lady Laura again except when they\r\nchanced to meet in company,--on which occasions he simply bowed to\r\nher. Now the Earl had almost turned him out of his house. And though\r\nthere had been to a certain extent a reconciliation between him and\r\nLord Chiltern, he in these days never saw the friend who had once put\r\nhim upon Bonebreaker; and now,--now that Violet Effingham was again\r\nfree,--how was it possible to avoid some renewal of enmity between\r\nthem? He would, however, endeavour to see Lord Chiltern at once.\r\n\r\nAnd then he thought of Violet,--of Violet again free, of Violet as\r\nagain a possible wife for himself, of Violet to whom he might address\r\nhimself at any rate without any scruple as to his own unworthiness.\r\nEverybody concerned, and many who were not concerned at all, were\r\naware that he had been among her lovers, and he thought that he could\r\nperceive that those who interested themselves on the subject, had\r\nregarded him as the only horse in the race likely to run with success\r\nagainst Lord Chiltern. She herself had received his offers without\r\nscorn, and had always treated him as though he were a favoured\r\nfriend, though not favoured as a lover. And now even Lady Baldock was\r\nsmiling upon him, and asking him to her house as though the red-faced\r\nporter in the hall in Berkeley Square had never been ordered to\r\nrefuse him a moment\'s admission inside the doors. He had been very\r\nhumble in speaking of his own hopes to the Earl, but surely there\r\nmight be a chance. What if after all the little strain which he had\r\nhad in his back was to be cured after such a fashion as this! When he\r\ngot to his lodgings, he found a card from Lady Baldock, informing him\r\nthat Lady Baldock would be at home on a certain night, and that there\r\nwould be music. He could not go to Lady Baldock\'s on the night named,\r\nas it would be necessary that he should be in the House;--nor did he\r\nmuch care to go there, as Violet Effingham was not in town. But he\r\nwould call and explain, and endeavour to curry favour in that way.\r\n\r\nHe at once wrote a note to Lord Chiltern, which he addressed to\r\nPortman Square. "As you are in town, can we not meet? Come and dine\r\nwith me at the ---- Club on Saturday." That was the note. After a\r\nfew days he received the following answer, dated from the Bull at\r\nWillingford. Why on earth should Chiltern be staying at the Bull at\r\nWillingford in May?\r\n\r\n\r\n   The old Shop at W----, Friday.\r\n\r\n   DEAR PHINEAS,\r\n\r\n   I can\'t dine with you, because I am down here, looking\r\n   after the cripples, and writing a sporting novel. They\r\n   tell me I ought to do something, so I am going to do that.\r\n   I hope you don\'t think I turned informer against you in\r\n   telling the Earl of our pleasant little meeting on the\r\n   sands. It had become necessary, and you are too much of a\r\n   man to care much for any truth being told. He was terribly\r\n   angry both with me and with you; but the fact is, he is so\r\n   blindly unreasonable that one cannot regard his anger. I\r\n   endeavoured to tell the story truly, and, so told, it\r\n   certainly should not have injured you in his estimation.\r\n   But it did. Very sorry, old fellow, and I hope you\'ll get\r\n   over it. It is a good deal more important to me than to\r\n   you.\r\n\r\n   Yours,\r\n\r\n   C.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was not a word about Violet. But then it was hardly to be\r\nexpected that there should be words about Violet. It was not likely\r\nthat a man should write to his rival of his own failure. But yet\r\nthere was a flavour of Violet in the letter which would not have been\r\nthere, so Phineas thought, if the writer had been despondent. The\r\npleasant little meeting on the sands had been convened altogether in\r\nrespect of Violet. And the telling of the story to the Earl must have\r\narisen from discussions about Violet. Lord Chiltern must have told\r\nhis father that Phineas was his rival. Could the rejected suitor have\r\nwritten on such a subject in such a strain to such a correspondent\r\nif he had believed his own rejection to be certain? But then\r\nLord Chiltern was not like anybody else in the world, and it was\r\nimpossible to judge of him by one\'s experience of the motives of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards Phineas did call in Berkeley Square, and was shown\r\nup at once into Lady Baldock\'s drawing-room. The whole aspect of the\r\nporter\'s countenance was changed towards him, and from this, too, he\r\ngathered good auguries This had surprised him; but his surprise was\r\nfar greater, when, on entering the room, he found Violet Effingham\r\nthere alone. A little fresh colour came to her face as she greeted\r\nhim, though it cannot be said that she blushed. She behaved herself\r\nadmirably, not endeavouring to conceal some little emotion at thus\r\nmeeting him, but betraying none that was injurious to her composure.\r\n"I am so glad to see you, Mr. Finn," she said. "My aunt has just left\r\nme, and will be back directly."\r\n\r\nHe was by no means her equal in his management of himself on the\r\noccasion; but perhaps it may be acknowledged that his position\r\nwas the more difficult of the two. He had not seen her since her\r\nengagement had been proclaimed to the world, and now he had heard\r\nfrom a source which was not to be doubted, that it had been broken\r\noff. Of course there was nothing to be said on that matter. He could\r\nnot have congratulated her in the one case, nor could he either\r\ncongratulate her or condole with her on the other. And yet he did not\r\nknow how to speak to her as though no such events had occurred. "I\r\ndid not know that you were in town," he said.\r\n\r\n"I only came yesterday. I have been, you know, at Rome with the\r\nEffinghams; and since that I have been--; but, indeed, I have been\r\nsuch a vagrant that I cannot tell you of all my comings and goings.\r\nAnd you,--you are hard at work!"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;--always."\r\n\r\n"That is right. I wish I could be something, if it were only a stick\r\nin waiting, or a door-keeper. It is so good to be something." Was it\r\nsome such teaching as this that had jarred against Lord Chiltern\'s\r\nsusceptibilities, and had seemed to him to be a repetition of his\r\nfather\'s sermons?\r\n\r\n"A man should try to be something," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"And a woman must be content to be nothing,--unless Mr. Mill can pull\r\nus through! And now, tell me,--have you seen Lady Laura?"\r\n\r\n"Not lately."\r\n\r\n"Nor Mr. Kennedy?"\r\n\r\n"I sometimes see him in the House." The visit to the Colonial Office\r\nof which the reader has been made aware had not at that time as yet\r\nbeen made.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry for all that," she said. Upon which Phineas smiled and\r\nshook his head. "I am very sorry that there should be a quarrel\r\nbetween you two."\r\n\r\n"There is no quarrel."\r\n\r\n"I used to think that you and he might do so much for each\r\nother,--that is, of course, if you could make a friend of him."\r\n\r\n"He is a man of whom it is very hard to make a friend," said Phineas,\r\nfeeling that he was dishonest to Mr. Kennedy in saying so, but\r\nthinking that such dishonesty was justified by what he owed to Lady\r\nLaura.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--he is hard, and what I call ungenial. We won\'t say anything\r\nabout him,--will we? Have you seen much of the Earl?" This she asked\r\nas though such a question had no reference whatever to Lord Chiltern.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear,--alas, alas!"\r\n\r\n"You have not quarrelled with him too?"\r\n\r\n"He has quarrelled with me. He has heard, Miss Effingham, of what\r\nhappened last year, and he thinks that I was wrong."\r\n\r\n"Of course you were wrong, Mr. Finn."\r\n\r\n"Very likely. To him I chose to defend myself, but I certainly shall\r\nnot do so to you. At any rate, you did not think it necessary to\r\nquarrel with me."\r\n\r\n"I ought to have done so. I wonder why my aunt does not come." Then\r\nshe rang the bell.\r\n\r\n"Now I have told you all about myself," said he; "you should tell me\r\nsomething of yourself."\r\n\r\n"About me? I am like the knife-grinder, who had no story to\r\ntell,--none at least to be told. We have all, no doubt, got our\r\nlittle stories, interesting enough to ourselves."\r\n\r\n"But your story, Miss Effingham," he said, "is of such intense\r\ninterest to me." At that moment, luckily, Lady Baldock came into\r\nthe room, and Phineas was saved from the necessity of making a\r\ndeclaration at a moment which would have been most inopportune.\r\n\r\nLady Baldock was exceedingly gracious to him, bidding Violet use her\r\ninfluence to persuade him to come to the gathering. "Persuade him to\r\ndesert his work to come and hear some fiddlers!" said Miss Effingham.\r\n"Indeed I shall not, aunt. Who can tell but what the colonies might\r\nsuffer from it through centuries, and that such a lapse of duty might\r\ndrive a province or two into the arms of our mortal enemies?"\r\n\r\n"Herr Moll is coming," said Lady Baldock, "and so is Signor Scrubi,\r\nand Pjinskt, who, they say, is the greatest man living on the\r\nflageolet. Have you ever heard Pjinskt, Mr. Finn?" Phineas never had\r\nheard Pjinskt. "And as for Herr Moll, there is nothing equal to him,\r\nthis year, at least." Lady Baldock had taken up music this season,\r\nbut all her enthusiasm was unable to shake the conscientious zeal of\r\nthe young Under-Secretary of State. At such a gathering he would have\r\nbeen unable to say a word in private to Violet Effingham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX\r\n\r\nMadame Goesler\'s Politics\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be remembered that when Lady Glencora Palliser was shown into\r\nMadame Goesler\'s room, Madame Goesler had just explained somewhat\r\nforcibly to the Duke of Omnium her reasons for refusing the loan of\r\nhis Grace\'s villa at Como. She had told the Duke in so many words\r\nthat she did not mean to give the world an opportunity of maligning\r\nher, and it would then have been left to the Duke to decide whether\r\nany other arrangements might have been made for taking Madame Goesler\r\nto Como, had he not been interrupted. That he was very anxious to\r\ntake her was certain. The green brougham had already been often\r\nenough at the door in Park Lane to make his Grace feel that Madame\r\nGoesler\'s company was very desirable,--was, perhaps, of all things\r\nleft for his enjoyment, the one thing the most desirable. Lady\r\nGlencora had spoken to her husband of children crying for the top\r\nbrick of the chimney. Now it had come to this, that in the eyes\r\nof the Duke of Omnium Marie Max Goesler was the top brick of the\r\nchimney. She had more wit for him than other women,--more of that\r\nsort of wit which he was capable of enjoying. She had a beauty which\r\nhe had learned to think more alluring than other beauty. He was sick\r\nof fair faces, and fat arms, and free necks. Madame Goesler\'s eyes\r\nsparkled as other eyes did not sparkle, and there was something\r\nof the vagueness of mystery in the very blackness and gloss and\r\nabundance of her hair,--as though her beauty was the beauty of some\r\nworld which he had not yet known. And there was a quickness and yet\r\na grace of motion about her which was quite new to him. The ladies\r\nupon whom the Duke had of late most often smiled had been somewhat\r\nslow,--perhaps almost heavy,--though, no doubt, graceful withal. In\r\nhis early youth he remembered to have seen, somewhere in Greece, such\r\na houri as was this Madame Goesler. The houri in that case had run\r\noff with the captain of a Russian vessel engaged in the tallow trade;\r\nbut not the less was there left on his Grace\'s mind some dreamy\r\nmemory of charms which had impressed him very strongly when he was\r\nsimply a young Mr. Palliser, and had had at his command not so\r\nconvenient a mode of sudden abduction as the Russian captain\'s tallow\r\nship. Pressed hard by such circumstances as these, there is no\r\nknowing how the Duke might have got out of his difficulties had not\r\nLady Glencora appeared upon the scene.\r\n\r\nSince the future little Lord Silverbridge had been born, the Duke had\r\nbeen very constant in his worship of Lady Glencora, and as, from year\r\nto year, a little brother was added, thus making the family very\r\nstrong and stable, his acts of worship had increased; but with his\r\nworship there had come of late something almost of dread,--something\r\nalmost of obedience, which had made those who were immediately\r\nabout the Duke declare that his Grace was a good deal changed. For,\r\nhitherto, whatever may have been the Duke\'s weaknesses, he certainly\r\nhad known no master. His heir, Plantagenet Palliser, had been always\r\nsubject to him. His other relations had been kept at such a distance\r\nas hardly to be more than recognised; and though his Grace no\r\ndoubt had had his intimacies, they who had been intimate with him\r\nhad either never tried to obtain ascendancy, or had failed. Lady\r\nGlencora, whether with or without a struggle, had succeeded, and\r\npeople about the Duke said that the Duke was much changed. Mr.\r\nFothergill,--who was his Grace\'s man of business, and who was not\r\na favourite with Lady Glencora,--said that he was very much changed\r\nindeed. Finding his Grace so much changed, Mr. Fothergill had made\r\na little attempt at dictation himself, but had receded with fingers\r\nvery much scorched in the attempt. It was indeed possible that the\r\nDuke was becoming in the slightest degree weary of Lady Glencora\'s\r\nthraldom, and that he thought that Madame Max Goesler might be more\r\ntender with him. Madame Max Goesler, however, intended to be tender\r\nonly on one condition.\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Glencora entered the room, Madame Goesler received her\r\nbeautifully. "How lucky that you should have come just when his Grace\r\nis here!" she said.\r\n\r\n"I saw my uncle\'s carriage, and of course I knew it," said Lady\r\nGlencora.\r\n\r\n"Then the favour is to him," said Madame Goesler, smiling.\r\n\r\n"No, indeed; I was coming. If my word is to be doubted in that point,\r\nI must insist on having the servant up; I must, certainly. I told\r\nhim to drive to this door, as far back as Grosvenor Street. Did I\r\nnot, Planty?" Planty was the little Lord Silverbridge as was to\r\nbe, if nothing unfortunate intervened, who was now sitting on his\r\ngranduncle\'s knee.\r\n\r\n"Dou said to the little house in Park Lane," said the boy.\r\n\r\n"Yes,--because I forgot the number."\r\n\r\n"And it is the smallest house in Park Lane, so the evidence is\r\ncomplete," said Madame Goesler. Lady Glencora had not cared much for\r\nevidence to convince Madame Goesler, but she had not wished her uncle\r\nto think that he was watched and hunted down. It might be necessary\r\nthat he should know that he was watched, but things had not come to\r\nthat as yet.\r\n\r\n"How is Plantagenet?" asked the Duke.\r\n\r\n"Answer for papa," said Lady Glencora to her child.\r\n\r\n"Papa is very well, but he almost never comes home."\r\n\r\n"He is working for his country," said the Duke. "Your papa is a busy,\r\nuseful man, and can\'t afford time to play with a little boy as I\r\ncan."\r\n\r\n"But papa is not a duke."\r\n\r\n"He will be some day, and that probably before long, my boy. He will\r\nbe a duke quite as soon as he wants to be a duke. He likes the House\r\nof Commons better than the strawberry leaves, I fancy. There is not a\r\nman in England less in a hurry than he is."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed," said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"How nice that is," said Madame Goesler.\r\n\r\n"And I ain\'t in a hurry either,--am I, mamma?" said the little future\r\nLord Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"You are a wicked little monkey," said his grand-uncle, kissing him.\r\nAt this moment Lady Glencora was, no doubt, thinking how necessary\r\nit was that she should be careful to see that things did turn out\r\nin the manner proposed,--so that people who had waited should not\r\nbe disappointed; and the Duke was perhaps thinking that he was not\r\nabsolutely bound to his nephew by any law of God or man; and Madame\r\nMax Goesler,--I wonder whether her thoughts were injurious to the\r\nprospects of that handsome bold-faced little boy.\r\n\r\nLady Glencora rose to take her leave first. It was not for her to\r\nshow any anxiety to force the Duke out of the lady\'s presence. If the\r\nDuke were resolved to make a fool of himself, nothing that she could\r\ndo would prevent it. But she thought that this little inspection\r\nmight possibly be of service, and that her uncle\'s ardour would\r\nbe cooled by the interruption to which he had been subjected. So\r\nshe went, and immediately afterwards the Duke followed her. The\r\ninterruption had, at any rate, saved him on that occasion from making\r\nthe highest bid for the pleasure of Madame Goesler\'s company at Como.\r\nThe Duke went down with the little boy in his hand, so that there\r\nwas not an opportunity for a single word of interest between the\r\ngentleman and the lady.\r\n\r\nMadame Goesler, when she was alone, seated herself on her sofa,\r\ntucking her feet up under her as though she were seated somewhere in\r\nthe East, pushed her ringlets back roughly from her face, and then\r\nplaced her two hands to her sides so that her thumbs rested lightly\r\non her girdle. When alone with something weighty on her mind she\r\nwould sit in this form for the hour together, resolving, or trying\r\nto resolve, what should be her conduct. She did few things without\r\nmuch thinking, and though she walked very boldly, she walked warily.\r\nShe often told herself that such success as she had achieved could\r\nnot have been achieved without much caution. And yet she was ever\r\ndiscontented with herself, telling herself that all that she had done\r\nwas nothing, or worse than nothing. What was it all, to have a duke\r\nand to have lords dining with her, to dine with lords or with a duke\r\nitself, if life were dull with her, and the hours hung heavy! Life\r\nwith her was dull, and the hours did hang heavy. And what if she\r\ncaught this old man, and became herself a duchess,--caught him by\r\nmeans of his weakness, to the inexpressible dismay of all those\r\nwho were bound to him by ties of blood,--would that make her life\r\nhappier, or her hours less tedious? That prospect of a life on the\r\nItalian lakes with an old man tied to her side was not so charming in\r\nher eyes as it was in those of the Duke. Were she to succeed, and to\r\nbe blazoned forth to the world as Duchess of Omnium, what would she\r\nhave gained?\r\n\r\nShe perfectly understood the motive of Lady Glencora\'s visit, and\r\nthought that she would at any rate gain something in the very triumph\r\nof baffling the manoeuvres of so clever a woman. Let Lady Glencora\r\nthrow her aegis before the Duke, and it would be something to carry\r\noff his Grace from beneath the protection of so thick a shield. The\r\nvery flavour of the contest was pleasing to Madame Goesler. But, the\r\nvictory gained, what then would remain to her? Money she had already;\r\nposition, too, she had of her own. She was free as air, and should it\r\nsuit her at any time to go off to some lake of Como in society that\r\nwould personally be more agreeable to her than that of the Duke of\r\nOmnium, there was nothing to hinder her for a moment. And then came a\r\nsmile over her face,--but the saddest smile,--as she thought of one\r\nwith whom it might be pleasant to look at the colour of Italian skies\r\nand feel the softness of Italian breezes. In feigning to like to do\r\nthis with an old man, in acting the raptures of love on behalf of a\r\nworn-out duke who at the best would scarce believe in her acting,\r\nthere would not be much delight for her. She had never yet known what\r\nit was to have anything of the pleasure of love. She had grown, as\r\nshe often told herself, to be a hard, cautious, selfish, successful\r\nwoman, without any interference or assistance from such pleasure.\r\nMight there not be yet time left for her to try it without\r\nselfishness,--with an absolute devotion of self,--if only she\r\ncould find the right companion? There was one who might be such a\r\ncompanion, but the Duke of Omnium certainly could not be such a one.\r\n\r\nBut to be Duchess of Omnium! After all, success in this world is\r\neverything;--is at any rate the only thing the pleasure of which will\r\nendure. There was the name of many a woman written in a black list\r\nwithin Madame Goesler\'s breast,--written there because of scorn,\r\nbecause of rejected overtures, because of deep social injury; and\r\nMadame Goesler told herself often that it would be a pleasure to her\r\nto use the list, and to be revenged on those who had ill-used and\r\nscornfully treated her. She did not readily forgive those who had\r\ninjured her. As Duchess of Omnium she thought that probably she might\r\nuse that list with efficacy. Lady Glencora had treated her well, and\r\nshe had no such feeling against Lady Glencora. As Duchess of Omnium\r\nshe would accept Lady Glencora as her dearest friend, if Lady\r\nGlencora would admit it. But if it should be necessary that there\r\nshould be a little duel between them, as to which of them should take\r\nthe Duke in hand, the duel must of course be fought. In a matter so\r\nimportant, one woman would of course expect no false sentiment from\r\nanother. She and Lady Glencora would understand each other;--and no\r\ndoubt, respect each other.\r\n\r\nI have said that she would sit there resolving, or trying to resolve.\r\nThere is nothing in the world so difficult as that task of making\r\nup one\'s mind. Who is there that has not longed that the power and\r\nprivilege of selection among alternatives should be taken away from\r\nhim in some important crisis of his life, and that his conduct should\r\nbe arranged for him, either this way or that, by some divine power\r\nif it were possible,--by some patriarchal power in the absence of\r\ndivinity,--or by chance even, if nothing better than chance could be\r\nfound to do it? But no one dares to cast the die, and to go honestly\r\nby the hazard. There must be the actual necessity of obeying the die,\r\nbefore even the die can be of any use. As it was, when Madame Goesler\r\nhad sat there for an hour, till her legs were tired beneath her, she\r\nhad not resolved. It must be as her impulse should direct her when\r\nthe important moment came. There was not a soul on earth to whom she\r\ncould go for counsel, and when she asked herself for counsel, the\r\ncounsel would not come.\r\n\r\nTwo days afterwards the Duke called again. He would come generally on\r\na Thursday,--early, so that he might be there before other visitors;\r\nand he had already quite learned that when he was there other\r\nvisitors would probably be refused admittance. How Lady Glencora had\r\nmade her way in, telling the servant that her uncle was there, he had\r\nnot understood. That visit had been made on the Thursday, but now he\r\ncame on the Saturday,--having, I regret to say, sent down some early\r\nfruit from his own hot-houses,--or from Covent Garden,--with a little\r\nnote on the previous day. The grapes might have been pretty well, but\r\nthe note was injudicious. There were three lines about the grapes, as\r\nto which there was some special history, the vine having been brought\r\nfrom the garden of some villa in which some ill-used queen had lived\r\nand died; and then there was a postscript in one line to say that the\r\nDuke would call on the following morning. I do not think that he had\r\nmeant to add this when he began his note; but then children, who want\r\nthe top brick, want it so badly, and cry for it so perversely!\r\n\r\nOf course Madame Goesler was at home. But even then she had not made\r\nup her mind. She had made up her mind only to this,--that he should\r\nbe made to speak plainly, and that she would take time for her reply.\r\nNot even with such a gem as the Duke\'s coronet before her eyes, would\r\nshe jump at it. Where there was so much doubt, there need at least be\r\nno impatience.\r\n\r\n"You ran away the other day, Duke, because you could not resist the\r\ncharm of that little boy," she said, laughing.\r\n\r\n"He is a dear little boy,--but it was not that," he answered.\r\n\r\n"Then what was it? Your niece carried you off in a whirl-wind. She\r\nwas come and gone, taking you with her, in half a minute."\r\n\r\n"She had disturbed me when I was thinking of something," said the\r\nDuke.\r\n\r\n"Things shouldn\'t be thought of,--not so deeply as that." Madame\r\nGoesler was playing with a bunch of his grapes now, eating one or\r\ntwo from a small china plate which had stood upon the table, and\r\nhe thought that he had never seen a woman so graceful and yet\r\nso natural. "Will you not eat your own grapes with me? They are\r\ndelicious;--flavoured with the poor queen\'s sorrows." He shook his\r\nhead, knowing that it did not suit his gastric juices to have to deal\r\nwith fruit eaten at odd times. "Never think, Duke. I am convinced\r\nthat it does no good. It simply means doubting, and doubt always\r\nleads to error. The safest way in the world is to do nothing."\r\n\r\n"I believe so," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"Much the safest. But if you have not sufficient command over\r\nyourself to enable you to sit in repose, always quiet, never\r\ncommitting yourself to the chance of any danger,--then take a leap in\r\nthe dark; or rather many leaps. A stumbling horse regains his footing\r\nby persevering in his onward course. As for moving cautiously, that I\r\ndetest."\r\n\r\n"And yet one must think;--for instance, whether one will succeed or\r\nnot."\r\n\r\n"Take that for granted always. Remember, I do not recommend motion at\r\nall. Repose is my idea of life;--repose and grapes."\r\n\r\nThe Duke sat for a while silent, taking his repose as far as the\r\nouter man was concerned, looking at his top brick of the chimney, as\r\nfrom time to time she ate one of his grapes. Probably she did not eat\r\nabove half-a-dozen of them altogether, but he thought that the grapes\r\nmust have been made for the woman, she was so pretty in the eating of\r\nthem. But it was necessary that he should speak at last. "Have you\r\nbeen thinking of coming to Como?" he said.\r\n\r\n"I told you that I never think."\r\n\r\n"But I want an answer to my proposition."\r\n\r\n"I thought I had answered your Grace on that question." Then she put\r\ndown the grapes, and moved herself on her chair, so that she sat with\r\nher face turned away from him.\r\n\r\n"But a request to a lady may be made twice."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. And I am grateful, knowing how far it is from your\r\nintention to do me any harm. And I am somewhat ashamed of my warmth\r\non the other day. But still there can be but one answer. There\r\nare delights which a woman must deny herself, let them be ever so\r\ndelightful."\r\n\r\n"I had thought,--" the Duke began, and then he stopped himself.\r\n\r\n"Your Grace was saying that you thought,--"\r\n\r\n"Marie, a man at my age does not like to be denied."\r\n\r\n"What man likes to be denied anything by a woman at any age? A woman\r\nwho denies anything is called cruel at once,--even though it be\r\nher very soul." She had turned round upon him now, and was leaning\r\nforward towards him from her chair, so that he could touch her if he\r\nput out his hand.\r\n\r\nHe put out his hand and touched her. "Marie," he said, "will you deny\r\nme if I ask?"\r\n\r\n"Nay, my lord; how shall I say? There is many a trifle I would deny\r\nyou. There is many a great gift I would give you willingly."\r\n\r\n"But the greatest gift of all?"\r\n\r\n"My lord, if you have anything to say, you must say it plainly. There\r\nnever was a woman worse than I am at the reading of riddles."\r\n\r\n"Could you endure to live in the quietude of an Italian lake with an\r\nold man?" Now he touched her again, and had taken her hand.\r\n\r\n"No, my lord;--nor with a young one,--for all my days. But I do not\r\nknow that age would guide me."\r\n\r\nThen the Duke rose and made his proposition in form. "Marie, you know\r\nthat I love you. Why it is that I at my age should feel so sore a\r\nlove, I cannot say."\r\n\r\n"So sore a love!"\r\n\r\n"So sore, if it be not gratified. Marie, I ask you to be my wife."\r\n\r\n"Duke of Omnium, this from you!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, from me. My coronet is at your feet. If you will allow me to\r\nraise it, I will place it on your brow."\r\n\r\nThen she went away from him, and seated herself at a distance. After\r\na moment or two he followed her, and stood with his arm upon her\r\nshoulder. "You will give me an answer, Marie?"\r\n\r\n"You cannot have thought of this, my lord."\r\n\r\n"Nay; I have thought of it much."\r\n\r\n"And your friends?"\r\n\r\n"My dear, I may venture to please myself in this,--as in everything.\r\nWill you not answer me?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not on the spur of the moment, my lord. Think how high is\r\nthe position you offer me, and how immense is the change you propose\r\nto me. Allow me two days, and I will answer you by letter. I am so\r\nfluttered now that I must leave you." Then he came to her, took her\r\nhand, kissed her brow, and opened the door for her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI\r\n\r\nAnother Duel\r\n\r\n\r\nIt happened that there were at this time certain matters of business\r\nto be settled between the Duke of Omnium and his nephew Mr. Palliser,\r\nrespecting which the latter called upon his uncle on the morning\r\nafter the Duke had committed himself by his offer. Mr. Palliser had\r\ncome by appointment made with Mr. Fothergill, the Duke\'s man of\r\nbusiness, and had expected to meet Mr. Fothergill. Mr. Fothergill,\r\nhowever, was not with the Duke, and the uncle told the nephew that\r\nthe business had been postponed. Then Mr. Palliser asked some\r\nquestion as to the reason of such postponement, not meaning much by\r\nhis question,--and the Duke, after a moment\'s hesitation, answered\r\nhim, meaning very much by his answer. "The truth is, Plantagenet,\r\nthat it is possible that I may marry, and if so this arrangement\r\nwould not suit me."\r\n\r\n"Are you going to be married?" asked the astonished nephew.\r\n\r\n"It is not exactly that,--but it is possible that I may do so. Since\r\nI proposed this matter to Fothergill, I have been thinking over it,\r\nand I have changed my mind. It will make but little difference to\r\nyou; and after all you are a far richer man than I am."\r\n\r\n"I am not thinking of money, Duke," said Plantagenet Palliser.\r\n\r\n"Of what then were you thinking?"\r\n\r\n"Simply of what you told me. I do not in the least mean to\r\ninterfere."\r\n\r\n"I hope not, Plantagenet."\r\n\r\n"But I could not hear such a statement from you without some\r\nsurprise. Whatever you do I hope will tend to make you happy."\r\n\r\nSo much passed between the uncle and the nephew, and what the uncle\r\ntold to the nephew, the nephew of course told to his wife. "He was\r\nwith her again, yesterday," said Lady Glencora, "for more than an\r\nhour. And he had been half the morning dressing himself before he\r\nwent to her."\r\n\r\n"He is not engaged to her, or he would have told me," said\r\nPlantagenet Palliser.\r\n\r\n"I think he would, but there is no knowing. At the present moment I\r\nhave only one doubt,--whether to act upon him or upon her."\r\n\r\n"I do not see that you can do good by going to either."\r\n\r\n"Well, we will see. If she be the woman I take her to be, I think I\r\ncould do something with her. I have never supposed her to be a bad\r\nwoman,--never. I will think of it." Then Lady Glencora left her\r\nhusband, and did not consult him afterwards as to the course she\r\nwould pursue. He had his budget to manage, and his speeches to make.\r\nThe little affair of the Duke and Madame Goesler, she thought it best\r\nto take into her own hands without any assistance from him. "What a\r\nfool I was," she said to herself, "to have her down there when the\r\nDuke was at Matching!"\r\n\r\nMadame Goesler, when she was left alone, felt that now indeed she\r\nmust make up her mind. She had asked for two days. The intervening\r\nday was a Sunday, and on the Monday she must send her answer. She\r\nmight doubt at any rate for this one night,--the Saturday night,--and\r\nsit playing, as it were, with the coronet of a duchess in her lap.\r\nShe had been born the daughter of a small country attorney, and now a\r\nduke had asked her to be his wife,--and a duke who was acknowledged\r\nto stand above other dukes! Nothing at any rate could rob her of that\r\nsatisfaction. Whatever resolution she might form at last, she had by\r\nher own resources reached a point of success in remembering which\r\nthere would always be a keen gratification. It would be much to be\r\nDuchess of Omnium; but it would be something also to have refused to\r\nbe a Duchess of Omnium. During that evening, that night, and the next\r\nmorning, she remained playing with the coronet in her lap. She would\r\nnot go to church. What good could any sermon do her while that bauble\r\nwas dangling before her eyes? After church-time, about two o\'clock,\r\nPhineas Finn came to her. Just at this period Phineas would come\r\nto her often;--sometimes full of a new decision to forget Violet\r\nEffingham altogether, at others minded to continue his siege let the\r\nhope of success be ever so small. He had now heard that Violet and\r\nLord Chiltern had in truth quarrelled, and was of course anxious to\r\nbe advised to continue the siege. When he first came in and spoke a\r\nword or two, in which there was no reference to Violet Effingham,\r\nthere came upon Madame Goesler a strong wish to decide at once that\r\nshe would play no longer with the coronet, that the gem was not worth\r\nthe cost she would be called upon to pay for it. There was something\r\nin the world better for her than the coronet,--if only it might be\r\nhad. But within ten minutes he had told her the whole tale about Lord\r\nChiltern, and how he had seen Violet at Lady Baldock\'s,--and how\r\nthere might yet be hope for him. What would she advise him to do? "Go\r\nhome, Mr. Finn," she said, "and write a sonnet to her eyebrow. See if\r\nthat will have any effect."\r\n\r\n"Ah, well! It is natural that you should laugh at me; but somehow, I\r\ndid not expect it from you."\r\n\r\n"Do not be angry with me. What I mean is that such little things seem\r\nto influence this Violet of yours."\r\n\r\n"Do they? I have not found that they do so."\r\n\r\n"If she had loved Lord Chiltern she would not have quarrelled with\r\nhim for a few words. If she had loved you, she would not have\r\naccepted Lord Chiltern. If she loves neither of you, she should say\r\nso. I am losing my respect for her."\r\n\r\n"Do not say that, Madame Goesler. I respect her as strongly as I love\r\nher." Then Madame Goesler almost made up her mind that she would have\r\nthe coronet. There was a substance about the coronet that would not\r\nelude her grasp.\r\n\r\nLate that afternoon, while she was still hesitating, there came\r\nanother caller to the cottage in Park Lane. She was still hesitating,\r\nfeeling that she had as yet another night before her. Should she be\r\nDuchess of Omnium or not? All that she wished to be, she could not\r\nbe;--but to be Duchess of Omnium was within her reach. Then she began\r\nto ask herself various questions. Would the Queen refuse to accept\r\nher in her new rank? Refuse! How could any Queen refuse to accept\r\nher? She had not done aught amiss in life. There was no slur on her\r\nname; no stain on her character. What though her father had been a\r\nsmall attorney, and her first husband a Jew banker! She had broken\r\nno law of God or man, had been accused of breaking no law, which\r\nbreaking or which accusation need stand in the way of her being as\r\ngood a duchess as any other woman! She was sitting thinking of this,\r\nalmost angry with herself at the awe with which the proposed rank\r\ninspired her, when Lady Glencora was announced to her.\r\n\r\n"Madame Goesler," said Lady Glencora, "I am very glad to find you."\r\n\r\n"And I more than equally so, to be found," said Madame Goesler,\r\nsmiling with all her grace.\r\n\r\n"My uncle has been with you since I saw you last?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;--more than once if I remember right. He was here yesterday\r\nat any rate."\r\n\r\n"He comes often to you then?"\r\n\r\n"Not so often as I would wish, Lady Glencora. The Duke is one of my\r\ndearest friends."\r\n\r\n"It has been a quick friendship."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--a quick friendship," said Madame Goesler. Then there was a\r\npause for some moments which Madame Goesler was determined that she\r\nwould not break. It was clear to her now on what ground Lady Glencora\r\nhad come to her, and she was fully minded that if she could bear the\r\nfull light of the god himself in all his glory, she would not allow\r\nherself to be scorched by any reflected heat coming from the god\'s\r\nniece. She thought she could endure anything that Lady Glencora might\r\nsay; but she would wait and hear what might be said.\r\n\r\n"I think, Madame Goesler, that I had better hurry on to my subject\r\nat once," said Lady Glencora, almost hesitating as she spoke, and\r\nfeeling that the colour was rushing up to her cheeks and covering her\r\nbrow. "Of course what I have to say will be disagreeable. Of course I\r\nshall offend you. And yet I do not mean it."\r\n\r\n"I shall be offended at nothing, Lady Glencora, unless I think that\r\nyou mean to offend me."\r\n\r\n"I protest that I do not. You have seen my little boy."\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed. The sweetest child! God never gave me anything half so\r\nprecious as that."\r\n\r\n"He is the Duke\'s heir."\r\n\r\n"So I understand."\r\n\r\n"For myself, by my honour as a woman, I care nothing. I am rich and\r\nhave all that the world can give me. For my husband, in this matter,\r\nI care nothing. His career he will make for himself, and it will\r\ndepend on no title."\r\n\r\n"Why all this to me, Lady Glencora? What have I to do with your\r\nhusband\'s titles?"\r\n\r\n"Much;--if it be true that there is an idea of marriage between you\r\nand the Duke of Omnium."\r\n\r\n"Psha!" said Madame Goesler, with all the scorn of which she was\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\n"It is untrue, then?" asked Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"No;--it is not untrue. There is an idea of such a marriage."\r\n\r\n"And you are engaged to him?"\r\n\r\n"No;--I am not engaged to him."\r\n\r\n"Has he asked you?"\r\n\r\n"Lady Glencora, I really must say that such a cross-questioning\r\nfrom one lady to another is very unusual. I have promised not to be\r\noffended, unless I thought that you wished to offend me. But do not\r\ndrive me too far."\r\n\r\n"Madame Goesler, if you will tell me that I am mistaken, I will beg\r\nyour pardon, and offer to you the most sincere friendship which one\r\nwoman can give another."\r\n\r\n"Lady Glencora, I can tell you nothing of the kind."\r\n\r\n"Then it is to be so! And have you thought what you would gain?"\r\n\r\n"I have thought much of what I should gain:--and something also of\r\nwhat I should lose."\r\n\r\n"You have money."\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed; plenty,--for wants so moderate as mine."\r\n\r\n"And position."\r\n\r\n"Well, yes; a sort of position. Not such as yours, Lady Glencora.\r\nThat, if it be not born to a woman, can only come to her from a\r\nhusband. She cannot win it for herself."\r\n\r\n"You are free as air, going where you like, and doing what you like."\r\n\r\n"Too free, sometimes," said Madame Goesler.\r\n\r\n"And what will you gain by changing all this simply for a title?"\r\n\r\n"But for such a title, Lady Glencora! It may be little to you to be\r\nDuchess of Omnium, but think what it must be to me!"\r\n\r\n"And for this you will not hesitate to rob him of all his friends, to\r\nembitter his future life, to degrade him among his peers,--"\r\n\r\n"Degrade him! Who dares say that I shall degrade him? He will exalt\r\nme, but I shall no whit degrade him. You forget yourself, Lady\r\nGlencora."\r\n\r\n"Ask any one. It is not that I despise you. If I did, would I offer\r\nyou my hand in friendship? But an old man, over seventy, carrying the\r\nweight and burden of such rank as his, will degrade himself in the\r\neyes of his fellows, if he marries a young woman without rank, let\r\nher be ever so clever, ever so beautiful. A Duke of Omnium may not do\r\nas he pleases, as may another man."\r\n\r\n"It may be well, Lady Glencora, for other dukes, and for the\r\ndaughters and heirs and cousins of other dukes, that his Grace should\r\ntry that question. I will, if you wish it, argue this matter with you\r\non many points, but I will not allow you to say that I should degrade\r\nany man whom I might marry. My name is as unstained as your own."\r\n\r\n"I meant nothing of that," said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"For him;--I certainly would not willingly injure him. Who wishes\r\nto injure a friend? And, in truth, I have so little to gain, that\r\nthe temptation to do him an injury, if I thought it one, is not\r\nstrong. For your little boy, Lady Glencora, I think your fears are\r\npremature." As she said this, there came a smile over her face, which\r\nthreatened to break from control and almost become laughter. "But, if\r\nyou will allow me to say so, my mind will not be turned against this\r\nmarriage half so strongly by any arguments you can use as by those\r\nwhich I can adduce myself. You have nearly driven me into it by\r\ntelling me I should degrade his house. It is almost incumbent on me\r\nto prove that you are wrong. But you had better leave me to settle\r\nthe matter in my own bosom. You had indeed."\r\n\r\nAfter a while Lady Glencora did leave her,--to settle the matter\r\nwithin her own bosom,--having no other alternative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII\r\n\r\nThe Letter That Was Sent to Brighton\r\n\r\n\r\nMonday morning came and Madame Goesler had as yet written no answer\r\nto the Duke of Omnium. Had not Lady Glencora gone to Park Lane on\r\nthe Sunday afternoon, I think the letter would have been written on\r\nthat day; but, whatever may have been the effect of Lady Glencora\'s\r\nvisit, it so far disturbed Madame Goesler as to keep her from her\r\nwriting-table. There was yet another night for thought, and then the\r\nletter should be written on the Monday morning.\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Glencora left Madame Goesler she went at once to the Duke\'s\r\nhouse. It was her custom to see her husband\'s uncle on a Sunday, and\r\nshe would most frequently find him just at this hour,--before he went\r\nup-stairs to dress for dinner. She usually took her boy with her, but\r\non this occasion she went alone. She had tried what she could do with\r\nMadame Goesler, and she found that she had failed. She must now make\r\nher attempt upon the Duke. But the Duke, perhaps anticipating some\r\nattack of the kind, had fled. "Where is his Grace, Barker?" said Lady\r\nGlencora to the porter. "We do not know, your ladyship. His Grace\r\nwent away yesterday evening with nobody but Lapoule." Lapoule was\r\nthe Duke\'s French valet. Lady Glencora could only return home and\r\nconsider in her own mind what batteries might yet be brought to\r\nbear upon the Duke, towards stopping the marriage, even after the\r\nengagement should have been made,--if it were to be made. Lady\r\nGlencora felt that such batteries might still be brought up as would\r\nnot improbably have an effect on a proud, weak old man. If all other\r\nresources failed, royalty in some of its branches might be induced\r\nto make a request, and every august relation in the peerage should\r\ninterfere. The Duke no doubt might persevere and marry whom he\r\npleased,--if he were strong enough. But it requires much personal\r\nstrength,--that standing alone against the well-armed batteries of\r\nall one\'s friends. Lady Glencora had once tried such a battle on\r\nher own behalf, and had failed. She had wished to be imprudent when\r\nshe was young; but her friends had been too strong for her. She had\r\nbeen reduced, and kept in order, and made to run in a groove,--and\r\nwas now, when she sat looking at her little boy with his bold face,\r\nalmost inclined to think that the world was right, and that grooves\r\nwere best. But if she had been controlled when she was young, so\r\nought the Duke to be controlled now that he was old. It is all very\r\nwell for a man or woman to boast that he,--or she,--may do what he\r\nlikes with his own,--or with her own. But there are circumstances in\r\nwhich such self-action is ruinous to so many that coercion from the\r\noutside becomes absolutely needed. Nobody had felt the injustice of\r\nsuch coercion when applied to herself more sharply than had Lady\r\nGlencora. But she had lived to acknowledge that such coercion might\r\nbe proper, and was now prepared to use it in any shape in which it\r\nmight be made available. It was all very well for Madame Goesler\r\nto laugh and exclaim, "Psha!" when Lady Glencora declared her real\r\ntrouble. But should it ever come to pass that a black-browed baby\r\nwith a yellow skin should be shown to the world as Lord Silverbridge,\r\nLady Glencora knew that her peace of mind would be gone for ever. She\r\nhad begun the world desiring one thing, and had missed it. She had\r\nsuffered much, and had then reconciled herself to other hopes. If\r\nthose other hopes were also to be cut away from her, the world would\r\nnot be worth a pinch of snuff to her. The Duke had fled, and she\r\ncould do nothing to-day; but to-morrow she would begin with her\r\nbatteries. And she herself had done the mischief! She had invited\r\nthis woman down to Matching! Heaven and earth!--that such a man as\r\nthe Duke should be such a fool!--The widow of a Jew banker! He, the\r\nDuke of Omnium,--and thus to cut away from himself, for the rest of\r\nhis life, all honour, all peace of mind, all the grace of a noble\r\nend to a career which, if not very noble in itself, had received\r\nthe praise of nobility! And to do this for a thin, black-browed,\r\nyellow-visaged woman with ringlets and devil\'s eyes, and a beard on\r\nher upper lip,--a Jewess,--a creature of whose habits of life and\r\nmanners of thought they all were absolutely ignorant; who drank,\r\npossibly; who might have been a forger, for what any one knew;\r\nan adventuress who had found her way into society by her art and\r\nperseverance,--and who did not even pretend to have a relation in\r\nthe world! That such a one should have influence enough to intrude\r\nherself into the house of Omnium, and blot the scutcheon, and,--\r\nwhat was worst of all,--perhaps be the mother of future dukes! Lady\r\nGlencora, in her anger, was very unjust to Madame Goesler, thinking\r\nall evil of her, accusing her in her mind of every crime, denying\r\nher all charm, all beauty. Had the Duke forgotten himself and his\r\nposition for the sake of some fair girl with a pink complexion and\r\ngrey eyes, and smooth hair, and a father, Lady Glencora thought that\r\nshe would have forgiven it better. It might be that Madame Goesler\r\nwould win her way to the coronet; but when she came to put it on, she\r\nshould find that there were sharp thorns inside the lining of it. Not\r\na woman worth the knowing in all London should speak to her;--nor a\r\nman either of those men with whom a Duchess of Omnium would wish to\r\nhold converse. She should find her husband rated as a doting fool,\r\nand herself rated as a scheming female adventuress. And it should go\r\nhard with Lady Glencora, if the Duke were not separated from his new\r\nDuchess before the end of the first year! In her anger Lady Glencora\r\nwas very unjust.\r\n\r\nThe Duke, when he left his house without telling his household\r\nwhither he was going, did send his address to,--the top brick of the\r\nchimney. His note, which was delivered at Madame Goesler\'s house late\r\non the Sunday evening, was as follows:--"I am to have your answer on\r\nMonday. I shall be at Brighton. Send it by a private messenger to the\r\nBedford Hotel there. I need not tell you with what expectation, with\r\nwhat hope, with what fear I shall await it.--O." Poor old man! He had\r\nrun through all the pleasures of life too quickly, and had not much\r\nleft with which to amuse himself. At length he had set his eyes on a\r\ntop brick, and being tired of everything else, wanted it very sorely.\r\nPoor old man! How should it do him any good, even if he got it?\r\nMadame Goesler, when she received the note, sat with it in her\r\nhand, thinking of his great want. "And he would be tired of his new\r\nplaything after a month," she said to herself. But she had given\r\nherself to the next morning, and she would not make up her mind that\r\nnight. She would sleep once more with the coronet of a duchess within\r\nher reach. She did do so; and woke in the morning with her mind\r\nabsolutely in doubt. When she walked down to breakfast, all doubt was\r\nat an end. The time had come when it was necessary that she should\r\nresolve, and while her maid was brushing her hair for her she did\r\nmake her resolution.\r\n\r\n"What a thing it is to be a great lady," said the maid, who may\r\nprobably have reflected that the Duke of Omnium did not come here so\r\noften for nothing.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by that, Lotta?"\r\n\r\n"The women I know, madame, talk so much of their countesses, and\r\nladyships, and duchesses. I would never rest till I had a title in\r\nthis country, if I were a lady,--and rich and beautiful."\r\n\r\n"And can the countesses, and the ladyships, and the duchesses do as\r\nthey please?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, madame;--I know not that."\r\n\r\n"But I know. That will do, Lotta. Now leave me." Then Madame Goesler\r\nhad made up her mind; but I do not know whether that doubt as to\r\nhaving her own way had much to do with it. As the wife of an old man\r\nshe would probably have had much of her own way. Immediately after\r\nbreakfast she wrote her answer to the Duke, which was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Park Lane, Monday.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR DUKE OF OMNIUM,\r\n\r\n   I find so great a difficulty in expressing myself to your\r\n   Grace in a written letter, that since you left me I have\r\n   never ceased to wish that I had been less nervous, less\r\n   doubting, and less foolish when you were present with me\r\n   here in my room. I might then have said in one word what\r\n   will take so many awkward words to explain.\r\n\r\n   Great as is the honour you propose to confer on me, rich\r\n   as is the gift you offer me, I cannot accept it. I cannot\r\n   be your Grace\'s wife. I may almost say that I knew it\r\n   was so when you parted from me; but the surprise of the\r\n   situation took away from me a part of my judgment, and\r\n   made me unable to answer you as I should have done. My\r\n   lord, the truth is, that I am not fit to be the wife of\r\n   the Duke of Omnium. I should injure you; and though I\r\n   should raise myself in name, I should injure myself in\r\n   character. But you must not think, because I say this,\r\n   that there is any reason why I should not be an honest\r\n   man\'s wife. There is none. I have nothing on my conscience\r\n   which I could not tell you,--or to another man; nothing\r\n   that I need fear to tell to all the world. Indeed, my\r\n   lord, there is nothing to tell but this,--that I am not\r\n   fitted by birth and position to be the wife of the Duke of\r\n   Omnium. You would have to blush for me, and that no man\r\n   shall ever have to do on my account.\r\n\r\n   I will own that I have been ambitious, too ambitious, and\r\n   have been pleased to think that one so exalted as you are,\r\n   one whose high position is so rife in the eyes of all men,\r\n   should have taken pleasure in my company. I will confess\r\n   to a foolish woman\'s silly vanity in having wished to be\r\n   known to be the friend of the Duke of Omnium. I am like\r\n   the other moths that flutter near the light and have their\r\n   wings burned. But I am wiser than they in this, that\r\n   having been scorched, I know that I must keep my distance.\r\n   You will easily believe that a woman, such as I am, does\r\n   not refuse to ride in a carriage with your Grace\'s arms on\r\n   the panels without a regret. I am no philosopher. I do not\r\n   pretend to despise the rich things of the world, or the\r\n   high things. According to my way of thinking a woman ought\r\n   to wish to be Duchess of Omnium;--but she ought to wish\r\n   also to be able to carry her coronet with a proper grace.\r\n   As Madame Goesler I can live, even among my superiors, at\r\n   my ease. As your Grace\'s wife, I should be easy no longer;\r\n   --nor would your Grace.\r\n\r\n   You will think perhaps that what I write is heartless,\r\n   that I speak altogether of your rank, and not at all of\r\n   the affection you have shown me, or of that which I might\r\n   possibly bear towards you. I think that when the first\r\n   flush of passion is over in early youth men and women\r\n   should strive to regulate their love, as they do their\r\n   other desires, by their reason. I could love your Grace,\r\n   fondly, as your wife, if I thought it well for your Grace\r\n   or for myself that we should be man and wife. As I think\r\n   it would be ill for both of us, I will restrain that\r\n   feeling, and remember your Grace ever with the purest\r\n   feeling of true friendship.\r\n\r\n   Before I close this letter, I must utter a word of\r\n   gratitude. In the kind of life which I have led as a\r\n   widow, a life which has been very isolated as regards\r\n   true fellowship, it has been my greatest effort to obtain\r\n   the good opinion of those among whom I have attempted to\r\n   make my way. I may, perhaps, own to you now that I have\r\n   had many difficulties. A woman who is alone in the world\r\n   is ever regarded with suspicion. In this country a woman\r\n   with a foreign name, with means derived from foreign\r\n   sources, with a foreign history, is specially suspected.\r\n   I have striven to live that down, and I have succeeded.\r\n   But in my wildest dreams I never dreamed of such success\r\n   as this,--that the Duke of Omnium should think me the\r\n   worthiest of the worthy. You may be sure that I am not\r\n   ungrateful,--that I never will be ungrateful. And I trust\r\n   it will not derogate from your opinion of my worth, that\r\n   I have known what was due to your Grace\'s highness.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be,\r\n   My Lord Duke,\r\n   Your most obliged and faithful servant,\r\n\r\n   MARIE MAX GOESLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n"How many unmarried women in England are there would do the same?"\r\nshe said to herself, as she folded the paper, and put it into an\r\nenvelope, and sealed the cover. The moment that the letter was\r\ncompleted she sent it off, as she was directed to send it, so\r\nthat there might be no possibility of repentance and subsequent\r\nhesitation. She had at last made up her mind, and she would stand\r\nby the making. She knew that there would come moments in which she\r\nwould deeply regret the opportunity that she had lost,--the chance\r\nof greatness that she had flung away from her. But so would she\r\nhave often regretted it, also, had she accepted the greatness. Her\r\nposition was one in which there must be regret, let her decision have\r\nbeen what it might. But she had decided, and the thing was done. She\r\nwould still be free,--Marie Max Goesler,--unless in abandoning her\r\nfreedom she would obtain something that she might in truth prefer to\r\nit. When the letter was gone she sat disconsolate, at the window of\r\nan up-stairs room in which she had written, thinking much of the\r\ncoronet, much of the name, much of the rank, much of that position\r\nin society which she had flattered herself she might have won for\r\nherself as Duchess of Omnium by her beauty, her grace, and her wit.\r\nIt had not been simply her ambition to be a duchess, without further\r\naim or object. She had fancied that she might have been such a\r\nduchess as there is never another, so that her fame might have been\r\ngreat throughout Europe, as a woman charming at all points. And she\r\nwould have had friends, then,--real friends, and would not have lived\r\nalone as it was now her fate to do. And she would have loved her\r\nducal husband, old though he was, and stiff with pomp and ceremony.\r\nShe would have loved him, and done her best to add something of\r\nbrightness to his life. It was indeed true that there was one whom\r\nshe loved better; but of what avail was it to love a man who, when he\r\ncame to her, would speak to her of nothing but of the charms which he\r\nfound in another woman!\r\n\r\nShe had been sitting thus at her window, with a book in her hand, at\r\nwhich she never looked, gazing over the park which was now beautiful\r\nwith its May verdure, when on a sudden a thought struck her. Lady\r\nGlencora Palliser had come to her, trying to enlist her sympathy for\r\nthe little heir, behaving, indeed, not very well, as Madame Goesler\r\nhad thought, but still with an earnest purpose which was in itself\r\ngood. She would write to Lady Glencora and put her out of her misery.\r\nPerhaps there was some feeling of triumph in her mind as she returned\r\nto the desk from which her epistle had been sent to the Duke;--not of\r\nthat triumph which would have found its gratification in boasting of\r\nthe offer that had been made to her, but arising from a feeling that\r\nshe could now show the proud mother of the bold-faced boy that though\r\nshe would not pledge herself to any woman as to what she might do or\r\nnot do, she was nevertheless capable of resisting such a temptation\r\nas would have been irresistible to many. Of the Duke\'s offer to her\r\nshe would have spoken to no human being, had not this woman shown\r\nthat the Duke\'s purpose was known at least to her, and now, in her\r\nletter, she would write no plain word of that offer. She would not\r\nstate, in words intelligible to any one who might read, that the Duke\r\nhad offered her his hand and his coronet. But she would write so that\r\nLady Glencora should understand her. And she would be careful that\r\nthere should be no word in the letter to make Lady Glencora think\r\nthat she supposed herself to be unfit for the rank offered to her.\r\nShe had been very humble in what she had written to the Duke, but\r\nshe would not be at all humble in what she was about to write to the\r\nmother of the bold-faced boy. And this was the letter when it was\r\nwritten:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR LADY GLENCORA,\r\n\r\n   I venture to send you a line to put you out of your\r\n   misery;--for you were very miserable when you were so good\r\n   as to come here yesterday. Your dear little boy is safe\r\n   from me;--and, what is more to the purpose, so are you and\r\n   your husband,--and your uncle, whom, in truth, I love. You\r\n   asked me a downright question which I did not then choose\r\n   to answer by a downright answer. The downright answer was\r\n   not at that time due to you. It has since been given, and\r\n   as I like you too well to wish you to be in torment, I\r\n   send you a line to say that I shall never be in the way of\r\n   you or your boy.\r\n\r\n   And now, dear Lady Glencora, one word more. Should it\r\n   ever again appear to you to be necessary to use your zeal\r\n   for the protection of your husband or your child, do not\r\n   endeavour to dissuade a woman by trying to make her think\r\n   that she, by her alliance, would bring degradation into\r\n   any house, or to any man. If there could have been an\r\n   argument powerful with me, to make me do that which you\r\n   wished to prevent, it was the argument which you used. But\r\n   my own comfort, and the happiness of another person whom\r\n   I value almost as much as myself, were too important to\r\n   be sacrificed even to a woman\'s revenge. I take mine by\r\n   writing to you and telling you that I am better and more\r\n   rational and wiser than you took me to be.\r\n\r\n   If, after this, you choose to be on good terms with me, I\r\n   shall be happy to be your friend. I shall want no further\r\n   revenge. You owe me some little apology; but whether you\r\n   make it or not, I will be contented, and will never do\r\n   more than ask whether your darling\'s prospects are still\r\n   safe. There are more women than one in the world, you\r\n   know, and you must not consider yourself to be out of the\r\n   wood because you have escaped from a single danger. If\r\n   there arise another, come to me, and we will consult\r\n   together.\r\n\r\n   Dear Lady Glencora, yours always sincerely,\r\n\r\n   MARIE M. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a thing or two besides which she longed to say, laughing\r\nas she thought of them. But she refrained, and her letter, when\r\nfinished, was as it is given above.\r\n\r\nOn the day following, Lady Glencora was again in Park Lane. When she\r\nfirst read Madame Goesler\'s letter, she felt herself to be annoyed\r\nand angry, but her anger was with herself rather than with her\r\ncorrespondent. Ever since her last interview with the woman whom she\r\nhad feared, she had been conscious of having been indiscreet. All her\r\nfeelings had been too violent, and it might well have been that she\r\nshould have driven this woman to do the very thing that she was so\r\nanxious to avoid. "You owe me some little apology," Madame Goesler\r\nhad said. It was true,--and she would apologise. Undue pride was not\r\na part of Lady Glencora\'s character. Indeed, there was not enough\r\nof pride in her composition. She had been quite ready to hate this\r\nwoman, and to fight her on every point as long as the danger existed;\r\nbut she was equally willing to take the woman to her heart now that\r\nthe danger was over. Apologise! Of course she would apologise. And\r\nshe would make a friend of the woman if the woman wished it. But she\r\nwould not have the woman and the Duke at Matching together again,\r\nlest, after all, there might be a mistake. She did not show Madame\r\nGoesler\'s letter to her husband, or tell him anything of the relief\r\nshe had received. He had cared but little for the danger, thinking\r\nmore of his budget than of the danger; and would be sufficiently at\r\nhis ease if he heard no more rumours of his uncle\'s marriage. Lady\r\nGlencora went to Park Lane early on the Tuesday morning, but she did\r\nnot take her boy with her. She understood that Madame Goesler might\r\nperhaps indulge in a little gentle raillery at the child\'s expense,\r\nand the mother felt that this might be borne the more easily if the\r\nchild were not present.\r\n\r\n"I have come to thank you for your letter, Madame Goesler," said Lady\r\nGlencora, before she sat down.\r\n\r\n"Oh, come ye in peace here, or come ye in war, or to dance at our\r\nbridal?" said Madame Goesler, standing up from her chair and\r\nlaughing, as she sang the lines.\r\n\r\n"Certainly not to dance at your bridal," said Lady Glencora.\r\n\r\n"Alas! no. You have forbidden the banns too effectually for that, and\r\nI sit here wearing the willow all alone. Why shouldn\'t I be allowed\r\nto get married as well as another woman, I wonder? I think you have\r\nbeen very hard upon me among you. But sit down, Lady Glencora. At any\r\nrate you come in peace."\r\n\r\n"Certainly in peace, and with much admiration,--and a great deal of\r\nlove and affection, and all that kind of thing, if you will only\r\naccept it."\r\n\r\n"I shall be too proud, Lady Glencora;--for the Duke\'s sake, if for no\r\nother reason."\r\n\r\n"And I have to make my apology."\r\n\r\n"It was made as soon as your carriage stopped at my door with\r\nfriendly wheels. Of course I understand. I can know how terrible it\r\nall was to you,--even though the dear little Plantagenet might not\r\nhave been in much danger. Fancy what it would be to disturb the\r\ncareer of a Plantagenet! I am far too well read in history, I can\r\nassure you."\r\n\r\n"I said a word for which I am sorry, and which I should not have\r\nsaid."\r\n\r\n"Never mind the word. After all, it was a true word. I do not\r\nhesitate to say so now myself, though I will allow no other woman\r\nto say it,--and no man either. I should have degraded him,--and\r\ndisgraced him." Madame Goesler now had dropped the bantering tone\r\nwhich she had assumed, and was speaking in sober earnest. "I, for\r\nmyself, have nothing about me of which I am ashamed. I have no\r\nhistory to hide, no story to be brought to light to my discredit.\r\nBut I have not been so born, or so placed by circumstances, as make\r\nme fit to be the wife of the Duke of Omnium. I should not have been\r\nhappy, you know."\r\n\r\n"You want nothing, dear Madame Goesler. You have all that society can\r\ngive you."\r\n\r\n"I do not know about that. I have much given to me by society, but\r\nthere are many things that I want;--a bright-faced little boy, for\r\ninstance, to go about with me in my carriage. Why did you not bring\r\nhim, Lady Glencora?"\r\n\r\n"I came out in my penitential sheet, and when one goes in that guise,\r\none goes alone. I had half a mind to walk."\r\n\r\n"You will bring him soon?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. He was very anxious to know the other day who was the\r\nbeautiful lady with the black hair."\r\n\r\n"You did not tell him that the beautiful lady with the black hair was\r\na possible aunt, was a possible--? But we will not think any more of\r\nthings so horrible."\r\n\r\n"I told him nothing of my fears, you may be sure."\r\n\r\n"Some day, when I am a very old woman, and when his father is quite\r\nan old duke, and when he has a dozen little boys and girls of his\r\nown, you will tell him the story. Then he will reflect what a madman\r\nhis great-uncle must have been, to have thought of making a duchess\r\nout of such a wizened old woman as that."\r\n\r\nThey parted the best of friends, but Lady Glencora was still of\r\nopinion that if the lady and the Duke were to be brought together at\r\nMatching, or elsewhere, there might still be danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII\r\n\r\nShowing How the Duke Stood His Ground\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Low the barrister, who had given so many lectures to our friend\r\nPhineas Finn, lectures that ought to have been useful, was now\r\nhimself in the House of Commons, having reached it in the legitimate\r\ncourse of his profession. At a certain point of his career, supposing\r\nhis career to have been sufficiently prosperous, it becomes natural\r\nto a barrister to stand for some constituency, and natural for him\r\nalso to form his politics at that period of his life with a view to\r\nhis further advancement, looking, as he does so, carefully at the age\r\nand standing of the various candidates for high legal office. When a\r\nman has worked as Mr. Low had worked, he begins to regard the bench\r\nwistfully, and to calculate the profits of a two years\' run in the\r\nAttorney-Generalship. It is the way of the profession, and thus a\r\nproper and sufficient number of real barristers finds its way into\r\nthe House. Mr. Low had been angry with Phineas because he, being a\r\nbarrister, had climbed into it after another fashion, having taken\r\nup politics, not in the proper way as an assistance to his great\r\nprofession, but as a profession in itself. Mr. Low had been quite\r\nsure that his pupil had been wrong in this, and that the error would\r\nat last show itself, to his pupil\'s cost. And Mrs. Low had been more\r\nsure than Mr. Low, having not unnaturally been jealous that a young\r\nwhipper-snapper of a pupil,--as she had once called Phineas,--should\r\nbecome a Parliament man before her husband, who had worked his way\r\nup gallantly, in the usual course. She would not give way a jot even\r\nnow,--not even when she heard that Phineas was going to marry this\r\nand that heiress. For at this period of his life such rumours were\r\nafloat about him, originating probably in his hopes as to Violet\r\nEffingham and his intimacy with Madame Goesler. "Oh, heiresses!"\r\nsaid Mrs. Low. "I don\'t believe in heiresses\' money till I see it.\r\nThree or four hundred a year is a great fortune for a woman, but it\r\ndon\'t go far in keeping a house in London. And when a woman has got\r\na little money she generally knows how to spend it. He has begun at\r\nthe wrong end, and they who do that never get themselves right at\r\nthe last."\r\n\r\nAt this time Phineas had become somewhat of a fine gentleman, which\r\nmade Mrs. Low the more angry with him. He showed himself willing\r\nenough to go to Mrs. Low\'s house, but when there he seemed to her\r\nto give himself airs. I think that she was unjust to him, and that\r\nit was natural that he should not bear himself beneath her remarks\r\nexactly as he had done when he was nobody. He had certainly been very\r\nsuccessful. He was always listened to in the House, and rarely spoke\r\nexcept on subjects which belonged to him, or had been allotted to him\r\nas part of his business. He lived quite at his ease with people of\r\nthe highest rank,--and those of his own mode of life who disliked him\r\ndid so simply because they regarded with envy his too rapid rise. He\r\nrode upon a pretty horse in the park, and was careful in his dress,\r\nand had about him an air of comfortable wealth which Mrs. Low thought\r\nhe had not earned. When her husband told her of his sufficient\r\nsalary, she would shake her head and express her opinion that a good\r\ntime was coming. By which she perhaps meant to imply a belief that\r\na time was coming in which her husband would have a salary much\r\nbetter than that now enjoyed by Phineas, and much more likely to be\r\npermanent. The Radicals were not to have office for ever, and when\r\nthey were gone, what then? "I don\'t suppose he saves a shilling,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Low. "How can he, keeping a horse in the park, and hunting\r\ndown in the country, and living with lords? I shouldn\'t wonder if he\r\nisn\'t found to be over head and ears in debt when things come to be\r\nlooked into." Mrs. Low was fond of an assured prosperity, of money in\r\nthe funds, and was proud to think that her husband lived in a house\r\nof his own. "L19 10s. ground-rent to the Portman estate is what we\r\npay, Mr. Bunce," she once said to that gallant Radical, "and that\r\ncomes of beginning at the right end. Mr. Low had nothing when he\r\nbegan the world, and I had just what made us decent the day we\r\nmarried. But he began at the right end, and let things go as they may\r\nhe can\'t get a fall." Mr. Bunce and Mrs. Low, though they differed\r\nmuch in politics, sympathised in reference to Phineas.\r\n\r\n"I never believes, ma\'am, in nobody doing any good by getting a\r\nplace," said Mr. Bunce. "Of course I don\'t mean judges and them like,\r\nwhich must be. But when a young man has ever so much a year for\r\nsitting in a big room down at Whitehall, and reading a newspaper\r\nwith his feet up on a chair, I don\'t think it honest, whether he\'s\r\na Parliament man or whether he ain\'t." Whence Mr. Bunce had got his\r\nnotions as to the way in which officials at Whitehall pass their\r\ntime, I cannot say; but his notions are very common notions. The\r\nBritish world at large is slow to believe that the great British\r\nhousekeeper keeps no more cats than what kill mice.\r\n\r\nMr. Low, who was now frequently in the habit of seeing Phineas at\r\nthe House, had somewhat changed his opinions, and was not so eager\r\nin condemning Phineas as was his wife. He had begun to think that\r\nperhaps Phineas had shown some knowledge of his own aptitudes in the\r\ncareer which he had sought, and was aware, at any rate, that his late\r\npupil was somebody in the House of Commons. A man will almost always\r\nrespect him whom those around him respect, and will generally look up\r\nto one who is evidently above himself in his own daily avocation. Now\r\nPhineas was certainly above Mr. Low in parliamentary reputation. He\r\nsat on a front bench. He knew the leaders of parties. He was at home\r\namidst the forms of the House. He enjoyed something of the prestige\r\nof Government power. And he walked about familiarly with the sons of\r\ndukes and the brothers of earls in a manner which had its effect even\r\non Mr. Low. Seeing these things Mr. Low could not maintain his old\r\nopinion as stoutly as did his wife. It was almost a privilege to Mr.\r\nLow to be intimate with Phineas Finn. How then could he look down\r\nupon him?\r\n\r\nHe was surprised, therefore, one day when Phineas discussed the\r\nmatter with him fully. Phineas had asked him what would be his chance\r\nof success if even now he were to give up politics and take to the\r\nBar as the means of earning his livelihood. "You would have uphill\r\nwork at first, as a matter of course," said Mr. Low.\r\n\r\n"But it might be done, I suppose. To have been in office would not be\r\nfatal to me?"\r\n\r\n"No, not fatal, Nothing of the kind need be fatal. Men have\r\nsucceeded, and have sat on the bench afterwards, who did not begin\r\ntill they were past forty. You would have to live down a prejudice\r\ncreated against yourself; that is all. The attorneys do not like\r\nbarristers who are anything else but barristers."\r\n\r\n"The attorneys are very arbitrary, I know," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--and there would be this against you--that it is so difficult\r\nfor a man to go back to the verdure and malleability of pupildom,\r\nwho has once escaped from the necessary humility of its conditions.\r\nYou will find it difficult to sit and wait for business in a\r\nVice-Chancellor\'s Court, after having had Vice-Chancellors, or men\r\nas big as Vice-Chancellors, to wait upon you."\r\n\r\n"I do not think much of that."\r\n\r\n"But others would think of it, and you would find that there were\r\ndifficulties. But you are not thinking of it in earnest?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, in earnest."\r\n\r\n"Why so? I should have thought that every day had removed you\r\nfurther and further from any such idea."\r\n\r\n"The ground I\'m on at present is so slippery."\r\n\r\n"Well, yes. I can understand that. But yet it is less slippery than\r\nit used to be."\r\n\r\n"Ah;--you do not exactly see. What if I were to lose my seat?"\r\n\r\n"You are safe at least for the next four years, I should say."\r\n\r\n"Ah;--no one can tell. And suppose I took it into my head to differ\r\nfrom the Government?"\r\n\r\n"You must not do that. You have put yourself into a boat with these\r\nmen, and you must remain in the boat. I should have thought all that\r\nwas easy to you."\r\n\r\n"It is not so easy as it seems. The very necessity of sitting still\r\nin the boat is in itself irksome,--very irksome. And then there comes\r\nsome crisis in which a man cannot sit still."\r\n\r\n"Is there any such crisis at hand now?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot say that;--but I am beginning to find that sitting still is\r\nvery disagreeable to me. When I hear those fellows below having their\r\nown way, and saying just what they like, it makes me furious. There\r\nis Robson. He tried office for a couple of years, and has broken\r\naway; and now, by George, there is no man they think so much of as\r\nthey do of Robson. He is twice the man he was when he sat on the\r\nTreasury Bench."\r\n\r\n"He is a man of fortune;--is he not?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose so. Of course he is, because he lives. He never earns\r\nanything. His wife had money."\r\n\r\n"My dear Finn, that makes all the difference. When a man has means\r\nof his own he can please himself. Do you marry a wife with money,\r\nand then you may kick up your heels, and do as you like about the\r\nColonial Office. When a man hasn\'t money, of course he must fit\r\nhimself to the circumstances of a profession."\r\n\r\n"Though his profession may require him to be dishonest."\r\n\r\n"I did not say that."\r\n\r\n"But I say it, my dear Low. A man who is ready to vote black white\r\nbecause somebody tells him, is dishonest. Never mind, old fellow. I\r\nshall pull through, I daresay. Don\'t go and tell your wife all this,\r\nor she\'ll be harder upon me than ever when she sees me." After that\r\nMr. Low began to think that his wife\'s judgment in this matter had\r\nbeen better than his own.\r\n\r\nRobson could do as he liked because he had married a woman with\r\nmoney. Phineas told himself that that game was also open to him. He,\r\ntoo, might marry money. Violet Effingham had money;--quite enough to\r\nmake him independent were he married to her. And Madame Goesler had\r\nmoney;--plenty of money. And an idea had begun to creep upon him that\r\nMadame Goesler would take him were he to offer himself. But he would\r\nsooner go back to the Bar as the lowest pupil, sooner clean boots for\r\nbarristers,--so he told himself,--than marry a woman simply because\r\nshe had money, than marry any other woman as long as there was a\r\nchance that Violet might be won. But it was very desirable that he\r\nshould know whether Violet might be won or not. It was now July, and\r\neverybody would be gone in another month. Before August would be over\r\nhe was to start for Ireland with Mr. Monk, and he knew that words\r\nwould be spoken in Ireland which might make it indispensable for\r\nhim to be, at any rate, able to throw up his office. In these days\r\nhe became more anxious than he used to be about Miss Effingham\'s\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\nHe had never spoken as yet to Lord Brentford since the day on which\r\nthe Earl had quarrelled with him, nor had he ever been at the house\r\nin Portman Square. Lady Laura he met occasionally, and had always\r\nspoken to her. She was gracious to him, but there had been no renewal\r\nof their intimacy. Rumours had reached him that things were going\r\nbadly with her and her husband; but when men repeated such rumours\r\nin his presence, he said little or nothing on the subject. It was\r\nnot for him, at any rate, to speak of Lady Laura\'s unhappiness. Lord\r\nChiltern he had seen once or twice during the last month, and they\r\nhad met cordially as friends. Of course he could ask no question\r\nfrom Lord Chiltern as to Violet; but he did learn that his friend\r\nhad again patched up some reconciliation with his father. "He has\r\nquarrelled with me, you know," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry, but what could I do? As things went, I was obliged\r\nto tell him."\r\n\r\n"Do not suppose for a moment that I am blaming you. It is, no doubt,\r\nmuch better that he should know it all."\r\n\r\n"And it cannot make much difference to you, I should say."\r\n\r\n"One doesn\'t like to quarrel with those who have been kind to one,"\r\nsaid Phineas.\r\n\r\n"But it isn\'t your doing. He\'ll come right again after a time. When\r\nI can get my own affairs settled, you may be sure I\'ll do my best to\r\nbring him round. But what\'s the reason you never see Laura now?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s the reason that everything goes awry?" said Phineas,\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\n"When I mentioned your name to Kennedy the other day, he looked as\r\nblack as thunder. But it is not odd that any one should quarrel with\r\nhim. I can\'t stand him. Do you know, I sometimes think that Laura\r\nwill have to give it up. Then there will be another mess in the\r\nfamily!"\r\n\r\nThis was all very well as coming from Lord Chiltern; but there was no\r\nword about Violet, and Phineas did not know how to get a word from\r\nany one. Lady Laura could have told him everything, but he could not\r\ngo to Lady Laura. He did go to Lady Baldock\'s house as often as he\r\nthought he could with propriety, and occasionally he saw Violet. But\r\nhe could do no more than see her, and the days and weeks were passing\r\nby, and the time was coming in which he would have to go away, and be\r\nwith her no more. The end of the season, which was always to other\r\nmen,--to other working men such as our hero,--a period of pleasurable\r\nanticipation, to him was a time of sadness, in which he felt that\r\nhe was not exactly like to, or even equal to, the men with whom he\r\nlived in London. In the old days, in which he was allowed to go to\r\nLoughlinter or to Saulsby, when all men and women were going to their\r\nLoughlinters and their Saulsbys, it was very well with him; but there\r\nwas something melancholy to him in his yearly journey to Ireland. He\r\nloved his father and mother and sisters as well as do other men; but\r\nthere was a falling off in the manner of his life which made him feel\r\nthat he had been in some sort out of his own element in London. He\r\nwould have liked to have shot grouse at Loughlinter, or pheasants at\r\nSaulsby, or to have hunted down at Willingford,--or better still, to\r\nhave made love to Violet Effingham wherever Violet Effingham might\r\nhave placed herself. But all this was closed to him now; and there\r\nwould be nothing for him but to remain at Killaloe, or to return\r\nto his work in Downing Street, from August to February. Mr. Monk,\r\nindeed, was going with him for a few weeks; but even this association\r\ndid not make up for that sort of society which he would have\r\npreferred.\r\n\r\nThe session went on very quietly. The question of the Irish Reform\r\nBill was postponed till the next year, which was a great thing\r\ngained. He carried his bill about the Canada Railway, with sundry\r\nother small bills appertaining to it, through the House in a manner\r\nwhich redounded infinitely to his credit. There was just enough\r\nof opposition to give a zest to the work, and to make the affair\r\nconspicuous among the affairs of the year. As his chief was in the\r\nother house, the work fell altogether into his hands, so that he came\r\nto be conspicuous among Under-Secretaries. It was only when he said\r\na word to any leaders of his party about other matters,--about Irish\r\nTenant-right, for instance, which was beginning to loom very large,\r\nthat he found himself to be snubbed. But there was no room for action\r\nthis year in reference to Irish Tenant-right, and therefore any deep\r\nconsideration of that discomfort might be legitimately postponed. If\r\nhe did by chance open his mouth on the subject to Mr. Monk, even Mr.\r\nMonk discouraged him.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of July, when the weather was very hot, and people\r\nwere beginning to complain of the Thames, and members were becoming\r\nthirsty after grouse, and the remaining days of parliamentary work\r\nwere being counted up, there came to him news,--news that was soon\r\nknown throughout the fashionable world,--that the Duke of Omnium was\r\ngoing to give a garden party at a certain villa residence on the\r\nbanks of the Thames above Richmond. It was to be such a garden party\r\nas had never been seen before. And it would be the more remarkable\r\nbecause the Duke had never been known to do such a thing. The villa\r\nwas called The Horns, and had, indeed, been given by the Duke to\r\nLady Glencora on her marriage; but the party was to be the Duke\'s\r\nparty, and The Horns, with all its gardens, conservatories, lawns,\r\nshrubberies, paddocks, boat-houses, and boats, was to be made bright\r\nand beautiful for the occasion. Scores of workmen were about the\r\nplace through the three first weeks of July. The world at large did\r\nnot at all know why the Duke was doing so unwonted a thing,--why\r\nhe should undertake so new a trouble. But Lady Glencora knew, and\r\nMadame Goesler shrewdly guessed, the riddle. When Madame Goesler\'s\r\nunexpected refusal had reached his Grace, he felt that he must either\r\naccept the lady\'s refusal, or persevere. After a day\'s consideration,\r\nhe resolved that he would accept it. The top brick of the chimney was\r\nvery desirable; but perhaps it might be well that he should endeavour\r\nto live without it. Then, accepting this refusal, he must either\r\nstand his ground and bear the blow,--or he must run away to that\r\nvilla at Como, or elsewhere. The running away seemed to him at first\r\nto be the better, or at least the more pleasant, course; but at last\r\nhe determined that he would stand his ground and bear the blow.\r\nTherefore he gave his garden party at The Horns.\r\n\r\nWho was to be invited? Before the first week in July was over, many\r\na bosom in London was fluttering with anxiety on that subject. The\r\nDuke, in giving his short word of instruction to Lady Glencora,\r\nmade her understand that he would wish her to be particular in her\r\ninvitations. Her Royal Highness the Princess, and his Royal Highness\r\nthe Prince, had both been so gracious as to say that they would\r\nhonour his fete. The Duke himself had made out a short list, with not\r\nmore than a dozen names. Lady Glencora was employed to select the\r\nreal crowd,--the five hundred out of the ten thousand who were to\r\nbe blessed. On the Duke\'s own private list was the name of Madame\r\nGoesler. Lady Glencora understood it all. When Madame Goesler got her\r\ncard, she thought that she understood it too. And she thought also\r\nthat the Duke was behaving in a gallant way.\r\n\r\nThere was, no doubt, much difficulty about the invitations, and a\r\nconsiderable amount of ill-will was created. And they who considered\r\nthemselves entitled to be asked, and were not asked, were full of\r\nwrath against their more fortunate friends, instead of being angry\r\nwith the Duke or with Lady Glencora, who had neglected them. It was\r\nsoon known that Lady Glencora was the real dispenser of the favours,\r\nand I fancy that her ladyship was tired of her task before it was\r\ncompleted. The party was to take place on Wednesday, the 27th of\r\nJuly, and before the day had come, men and women had become so hardy\r\nin the combat that personal applications were made with unflinching\r\nimportunity; and letters were written to Lady Glencora putting\r\nforward this claim and that claim with a piteous clamour. "No, that\r\nis too bad," Lady Glencora said to her particular friend, Mrs. Grey,\r\nwhen a letter came from Mrs. Bonteen, stating all that her husband\r\nhad ever done towards supporting Mr. Palliser in Parliament,--and all\r\nthat he ever would do. "She shan\'t have it, even though she could put\r\nPlantagenet into a minority to-morrow."\r\n\r\nMrs. Bonteen did not get a card; and when she heard that Phineas Finn\r\nhad received one, her wrath against Phineas was very great. He was\r\n"an Irish adventurer," and she regretted deeply that Mr. Bonteen had\r\never interested himself in bringing such an upstart forward in the\r\nworld of politics. But as Mr. Bonteen never had done anything towards\r\nbringing Phineas forward, there was not much cause for regret on this\r\nhead. Phineas, however, got his card, and, of course, accepted the\r\ninvitation.\r\n\r\nThe grounds were opened at four. There was to be an early dinner out\r\nin tents at five; and after dinner men and women were to walk about,\r\nor dance, or make love--or hay, as suited them. The haycocks,\r\nhowever, were ready prepared, while it was expected that they should\r\nbring the love with them. Phineas, knowing that he should meet Violet\r\nEffingham, took a great deal with him ready made.\r\n\r\nFor an hour and a half Lady Glencora kept her position in a saloon\r\nthrough which the guests passed to the grounds, and to every comer\r\nshe imparted the information that the Duke was on the lawn;--to every\r\ncomer but one. To Madame Goesler she said no such word. "So glad to\r\nsee you, my dear," she said, as she pressed her friend\'s hand: "if I\r\nam not killed by this work, I\'ll make you out again by-and-by." Then\r\nMadame Goesler passed on, and soon found herself amidst a throng\r\nof acquaintance. After a few minutes she saw the Duke seated in an\r\narm-chair, close to the river-bank, and she bravely went up to him,\r\nand thanked him for the invitation. "The thanks are due to you for\r\ngracing our entertainment," said the Duke, rising to greet her. There\r\nwere a dozen people standing round, and so the thing was done without\r\ndifficulty. At that moment there came a notice that their royal\r\nhighnesses were on the ground, and the Duke, of course, went off to\r\nmeet them. There was not a word more spoken between the Duke and\r\nMadame Goesler on that afternoon.\r\n\r\nPhineas did not come till late,--till seven, when the banquet was\r\nover. I think he was right in this, as the banqueting in tents loses\r\nin comfort almost more than it gains in romance. A small picnic may\r\nbe very well, and the distance previously travelled may give to a\r\ndinner on the ground the seeming excuse of necessity. Frail human\r\nnature must be supported,--and human nature, having gone so far\r\nin pursuit of the beautiful, is entitled to what best support the\r\nunaccustomed circumstances will allow. Therefore, out with the cold\r\npies, out with the salads, and the chickens, and the champagne. Since\r\nno better may be, let us recruit human nature sitting upon this moss,\r\nand forget our discomforts in the glory of the verdure around us. And\r\ndear Mary, seeing that the cushion from the waggonet is small, and\r\nnot wishing to accept the too generous offer that she should take it\r\nall for her own use, will admit a contact somewhat closer than the\r\nordinary chairs of a dining-room render necessary. That in its way is\r\nvery well;--but I hold that a banquet on narrow tables in a tent is\r\ndispleasing.\r\n\r\nPhineas strolled into the grounds when the tent was nearly empty, and\r\nwhen Lady Glencora, almost sinking beneath her exertions, was taking\r\nrest in an inner room. The Duke at this time was dining with their\r\nroyal highnesses, and three or four others, specially selected,\r\nvery comfortably within doors. Out of doors the world had begun to\r\ndance,--and the world was beginning to say that it would be much\r\nnicer to go and dance upon the boards inside as soon as possible.\r\nFor, though of all parties a garden party is the nicest, everybody\r\nis always anxious to get out of the garden as quick as may be. A few\r\nardent lovers of suburban picturesque effect were sitting beneath the\r\nhaycocks, and four forlorn damsels were vainly endeavouring to excite\r\nthe sympathy of manly youth by playing croquet in a corner. I am not\r\nsure, however, that the lovers beneath the haycocks and the players\r\nat croquet were not actors hired by Lady Glencora for the occasion.\r\n\r\nPhineas had not been long on the lawn before he saw Lady Laura\r\nKennedy. She was standing with another lady, and Barrington Erle was\r\nwith them. "So you have been successful?" said Barrington, greeting\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Successful in what?"\r\n\r\n"In what? In getting a ticket. I have had to promise three\r\ntide-waiterships, and to give deep hints about a bishopric expected\r\nto be vacant, before I got in. But what matters? Success pays for\r\neverything. My only trouble now is how I\'m to get back to London."\r\n\r\nLady Laura shook hands with Phineas, and then as he was passing on,\r\nfollowed him for a step and whispered a word to him. "Mr. Finn," she\r\nsaid, "if you are not going yet, come back to me presently. I have\r\nsomething to say to you. I shall not be far from the river, and shall\r\nstay here for about an hour."\r\n\r\nPhineas said that he would, and then went on, not knowing exactly\r\nwhere he was going. He had one desire,--to find Violet Effingham, but\r\nwhen he should find her he could not carry her off, and sit with her\r\nbeneath a haycock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV\r\n\r\nThe Horns\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile looking for Violet Effingham, Phineas encountered Madame\r\nGoesler, among a crowd of people who were watching the adventurous\r\nembarkation of certain daring spirits in a pleasure-boat. There were\r\nwatermen there in the Duke\'s livery, ready to take such spirits down\r\nto Richmond or up to Teddington lock, and many daring spirits did\r\ntake such trips,--to the great peril of muslins, ribbons, and starch,\r\nto the peril also of ornamental summer white garments, so that when\r\nthe thing was over, the boats were voted to have been a bore.\r\n\r\n"Are you going to venture?" said Phineas to the lady.\r\n\r\n"I should like it of all things if I were not afraid for my clothes.\r\nWill you come?"\r\n\r\n"I was never good upon the water. I should be sea-sick to a\r\ncertainty. They are going down beneath the bridge too, and we should\r\nbe splashed by the steamers. I don\'t think my courage is high\r\nenough." Thus Phineas excused himself, being still intent on\r\nprosecuting his search for Violet.\r\n\r\n"Then neither will I," said Madame Goesler. "One dash from a peccant\r\noar would destroy the whole symmetry of my dress. Look. That green\r\nyoung lady has already been sprinkled."\r\n\r\n"But the blue young gentleman has been sprinkled also," said Phineas,\r\n"and they will be happy in a joint baptism." Then they strolled along\r\nthe river path together, and were soon alone. "You will be leaving\r\ntown soon, Madame Goesler?"\r\n\r\n"Almost immediately."\r\n\r\n"And where do you go?"\r\n\r\n"Oh,--to Vienna. I am there for a couple of months every year,\r\nminding my business. I wonder whether you would know me, if you saw\r\nme;--sometimes sitting on a stool in a counting-house, sometimes\r\ngoing about among old houses, settling what must be done to save them\r\nfrom tumbling down. I dress so differently at such times, and talk so\r\ndifferently, and look so much older, that I almost fancy myself to be\r\nanother person."\r\n\r\n"Is it a great trouble to you?"\r\n\r\n"No,--I rather like it. It makes me feel that I do something in the\r\nworld."\r\n\r\n"Do you go alone?"\r\n\r\n"Quite alone. I take a German maid with me, and never speak a word to\r\nany one else on the journey."\r\n\r\n"That must be very bad," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Yes; it is the worst of it. But then I am so much accustomed to be\r\nalone. You see me in society, and in society only, and therefore\r\nnaturally look upon me as one of a gregarious herd; but I am in truth\r\nan animal that feeds alone and lives alone. Take the hours of the\r\nyear all through, and I am a solitary during four-fifths of them. And\r\nwhat do you intend to do?"\r\n\r\n"I go to Ireland."\r\n\r\n"Home to your own people. How nice! I have no people to go to. I\r\nhave one sister, who lives with her husband at Riga. She is my only\r\nrelation, and I never see her."\r\n\r\n"But you have thousands of friends in England."\r\n\r\n"Yes,--as you see them,"--and she turned and spread out her hands\r\ntowards the crowded lawn, which was behind them. "What are such\r\nfriends worth? What would they do for me?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know that the Duke would do much," said Phineas laughing.\r\n\r\nMadame Goesler laughed also. "The Duke is not so bad," she said. "The\r\nDuke would do as much as any one else. I won\'t have the Duke abused."\r\n\r\n"He may be your particular friend, for what I know," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Ah;--no. I have no particular friend. And were I to wish to choose\r\none, I should think the Duke a little above me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes;--and too stiff, and too old, and too pompous, and too cold,\r\nand too make-believe, and too gingerbread."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Finn!"\r\n\r\n"The Duke is all buckram, you know."\r\n\r\n"Then why do you come to his house?"\r\n\r\n"To see you, Madame Goesler."\r\n\r\n"Is that true, Mr. Finn?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--it is true in its way. One goes about to meet those whom one\r\nlikes, not always for the pleasure of the host\'s society. I hope I am\r\nnot wrong because I go to houses at which I like neither the host nor\r\nthe hostess." Phineas as he said this was thinking of Lady Baldock,\r\nto whom of late he had been exceedingly civil,--but he certainly did\r\nnot like Lady Baldock.\r\n\r\n"I think you have been too hard upon the Duke of Omnium. Do you know\r\nhim well?"\r\n\r\n"Personally? certainly not. Do you? Does anybody?"\r\n\r\n"I think he is a gracious gentleman," said Madame Goesler, "and\r\nthough I cannot boast of knowing him well, I do not like to hear him\r\ncalled buckram. I do not think he is buckram. It is not very easy for\r\na man in his position to live so as to please all people. He has to\r\nmaintain the prestige of the highest aristocracy in Europe."\r\n\r\n"Look at his nephew, who will be the next Duke, and who works as hard\r\nas any man in the country. Will he not maintain it better? What good\r\ndid the present man ever do?"\r\n\r\n"You believe only in motion, Mr. Finn;--and not at all in quiescence.\r\nAn express train at full speed is grander to you than a mountain with\r\nheaps of snow. I own that to me there is something glorious in the\r\ndignity of a man too high to do anything,--if only he knows how to\r\ncarry that dignity with a proper grace. I think that there should be\r\nbreasts made to carry stars."\r\n\r\n"Stars which they have never earned," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Ah;--well; we will not fight about it. Go and earn your star, and I\r\nwill say that it becomes you better than any glitter on the coat of\r\nthe Duke of Omnium." This she said with an earnestness which he could\r\nnot pretend not to notice or not to understand. "I too may be able to\r\nsee that the express train is really greater than the mountain."\r\n\r\n"Though, for your own life, you would prefer to sit and gaze upon the\r\nsnowy peaks?"\r\n\r\n"No;--that is not so. For myself, I would prefer to be of use\r\nsomewhere,--to some one, if it were possible. I strive sometimes."\r\n\r\n"And I am sure successfully."\r\n\r\n"Never mind. I hate to talk about myself. You and the Duke are\r\nfair subjects for conversation; you as the express train, who will\r\nprobably do your sixty miles an hour in safety, but may possibly go\r\ndown a bank with a crash."\r\n\r\n"Certainly I may," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"And the Duke, as the mountain, which is fixed in its stateliness,\r\nshort of the power of some earthquake, which shall be grander and\r\nmore terrible than any earthquake yet known. Here we are at the house\r\nagain. I will go in and sit down for a while."\r\n\r\n"If I leave you, Madame Goesler, I will say good-bye till next\r\nwinter."\r\n\r\n"I shall be in town again before Christmas, you know. You will come\r\nand see me?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I will."\r\n\r\n"And then this love trouble of course will be over,--one way or the\r\nother;--will it not?"\r\n\r\n"Ah!--who can say?"\r\n\r\n"Faint heart never won fair lady. But your heart is never faint.\r\nFarewell."\r\n\r\nThen he left her. Up to this moment he had not seen Violet, and yet\r\nhe knew that she was to be there. She had herself told him that she\r\nwas to accompany Lady Laura, whom he had already met. Lady Baldock\r\nhad not been invited, and had expressed great animosity against the\r\nDuke in consequence. She had gone so far as to say that the Duke was\r\na man at whose house a young lady such as her niece ought not to be\r\nseen. But Violet had laughed at this, and declared her intention of\r\naccepting the invitation. "Go," she had said; "of course I shall go.\r\nI should have broken my heart if I could not have got there." Phineas\r\ntherefore was sure that she must be in the place. He had kept his\r\neyes ever on the alert, and yet he had not found her. And now he must\r\nkeep his appointment with Lady Laura Kennedy. So he went down to the\r\npath by the river, and there he found her seated close by the water\'s\r\nedge. Her cousin Barrington Erle was still with her, but as soon as\r\nPhineas joined them, Erle went away. "I had told him," said Lady\r\nLaura, "that I wished to speak to you, and he stayed with me till you\r\ncame. There are worse men than Barrington a great deal."\r\n\r\n"I am sure of that."\r\n\r\n"Are you and he still friends, Mr. Finn?"\r\n\r\n"I hope so. I do not see so much of him as I did when I had less to\r\ndo."\r\n\r\n"He says that you have got into altogether a different set."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that. I have gone as circumstances have directed me,\r\nbut I have certainly not intended to throw over so old and good a\r\nfriend as Barrington Erle."\r\n\r\n"Oh,--he does not blame you. He tells me that you have found your\r\nway among what he calls the working men of the party, and he thinks\r\nyou will do very well,--if you can only be patient enough. We all\r\nexpected a different line from you, you know,--more of words and\r\nless of deeds, if I may say so;--more of liberal oratory and less of\r\ngovernment action; but I do not doubt that you are right."\r\n\r\n"I think that I have been wrong," said Phineas. "I am becoming\r\nheartily sick of officialities."\r\n\r\n"That comes from the fickleness about which papa is so fond of\r\nquoting his Latin. The ox desires the saddle. The charger wants to\r\nplough."\r\n\r\n"And which am I?"\r\n\r\n"Your career may combine the dignity of the one with the utility of\r\nthe other. At any rate you must not think of changing now. Have you\r\nseen Mr. Kennedy lately?" She asked the question abruptly, showing\r\nthat she was anxious to get to the matter respecting which she had\r\nsummoned him to her side, and that all that she had said hitherto had\r\nbeen uttered as it were in preparation of that subject.\r\n\r\n"Seen him? yes; I see him daily. But we hardly do more than speak,"\r\n\r\n"Why not?" Phineas stood for a moment in silence, hesitating. "Why is\r\nit that he and you do not speak?"\r\n\r\n"How can I answer that question, Lady Laura?"\r\n\r\n"Do you know any reason? Sit down, or, if you please, I will get up\r\nand walk with you. He tells me that you have chosen to quarrel with\r\nhim, and that I have made you do so. He says that you have confessed\r\nto him that I have asked you to quarrel with him."\r\n\r\n"He can hardly have said that."\r\n\r\n"But he has said it,--in so many words. Do you think that I would\r\ntell you such a story falsely?"\r\n\r\n"Is he here now?"\r\n\r\n"No;--he is not here. He would not come. I came alone."\r\n\r\n"Is not Miss Effingham with you?"\r\n\r\n"No;--she is to come with my father later. She is here no doubt, now.\r\nBut answer my question, Mr. Finn;--unless you find that you cannot\r\nanswer it. What was it that you did say to my husband?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing to justify what he has told you."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say that he has spoken falsely?"\r\n\r\n"I mean to use no harsh word,--but I think that Mr. Kennedy when\r\ntroubled in his spirit looks at things gloomily, and puts meaning\r\nupon words which they should not bear."\r\n\r\n"And what has troubled his spirit?"\r\n\r\n"You must know that better than I can do, Lady Laura. I will tell you\r\nall that I can tell you. He invited me to his house and I would not\r\ngo, because you had forbidden me. Then he asked me some questions\r\nabout you. Did I refuse because of you,--or of anything that you had\r\nsaid? If I remember right, I told him that I did fancy that you would\r\nnot be glad to see me,--and that therefore I would rather stay away.\r\nWhat was I to say?"\r\n\r\n"You should have said nothing."\r\n\r\n"Nothing with him would have been worse than what I did say. Remember\r\nthat he asked me the question point-blank, and that no reply would\r\nhave been equal to an affirmation. I should have confessed that his\r\nsuggestion was true."\r\n\r\n"He could not then have twitted me with your words."\r\n\r\n"If I have erred, Lady Laura, and brought any sorrow on you, I am\r\nindeed grieved."\r\n\r\n"It is all sorrow. There is nothing but sorrow. I have made up my\r\nmind to leave him."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lady Laura!"\r\n\r\n"It is very bad,--but not so bad, I think, as the life I am now\r\nleading. He has accused me--, of what do you think? He says that you\r\nare my lover!"\r\n\r\n"He did not say that,--in those words?"\r\n\r\n"He said it in words which made me feel that I must part from him."\r\n\r\n"And how did you answer him?"\r\n\r\n"I would not answer him at all. If he had come to me like a man,--not\r\naccusing me, but asking me,--I would have told him everything. And\r\nwhat was there to tell? I should have broken my faith to you, in\r\nspeaking of that scene at Loughlinter, but women always tell such\r\nstories to their husbands when their husbands are good to them, and\r\ntrue, and just. And it is well that they should be told. But to Mr.\r\nKennedy I can tell nothing. He does not believe my word."\r\n\r\n"Not believe you, Lady Laura?"\r\n\r\n"No! Because I did not blurt out to him all that story about your\r\nfoolish duel,--because I thought it best to keep my brother\'s secret,\r\nas long as there was a secret to be kept, he told me that I\r\nhad,--lied to him!"\r\n\r\n"What!--with that word?"\r\n\r\n"Yes,--with that very word. He is not particular about his words,\r\nwhen he thinks it necessary to express himself strongly. And he has\r\ntold me since that because of that he could never believe me again.\r\nHow is it possible that a woman should live with such a man?" But\r\nwhy did she come to him with this story,--to him whom she had been\r\naccused of entertaining as a lover;--to him who of all her friends\r\nwas the last whom she should have chosen as the recipient for such a\r\ntale? Phineas as he thought how he might best answer her, with what\r\nwords he might try to comfort her, could not but ask himself this\r\nquestion. "The moment that the word was out of his mouth," she went\r\non to say, "I resolved that I would tell you. The accusation is\r\nagainst you as it is against me, and is equally false to both. I\r\nhave written to him, and there is my letter."\r\n\r\n"But you will see him again?"\r\n\r\n"No;--I will go to my father\'s house. I have already arranged it. Mr.\r\nKennedy has my letter by this time, and I go from hence home with my\r\nfather."\r\n\r\n"Do you wish that I should read the letter?"\r\n\r\n"Yes,--certainly. I wish that you should read it. Should I ever meet\r\nhim again, I shall tell him that you saw it."\r\n\r\nThey were now standing close upon the river\'s bank, at a corner of\r\nthe grounds, and, though the voices of people sounded near to them,\r\nthey were alone. Phineas had no alternative but to read the letter,\r\nwhich was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   After what you have said to me it is impossible that I\r\n   should return to your house. I shall meet my father at the\r\n   Duke of Omnium\'s, and have already asked him to give me an\r\n   asylum. It is my wish to remain wherever he may be, either\r\n   in town or in the country. Should I change my purpose in\r\n   this, and change my residence, I will not fail to let you\r\n   know where I go and what I propose to do. You I think must\r\n   have forgotten that I was your wife; but I will never\r\n   forget it.\r\n\r\n   You have accused me of having a lover. You cannot have\r\n   expected that I should continue to live with you after\r\n   such an accusation. For myself I cannot understand how\r\n   any man can have brought himself to bring such a charge\r\n   against his wife. Even had it been true the accusation\r\n   should not have been made by your mouth to my ears.\r\n\r\n   That it is untrue I believe you must be as well aware as\r\n   I am myself. How intimate I was with. Mr. Finn, and what\r\n   were the limits of my intimacy with him you knew before\r\n   I married you. After our marriage I encouraged his\r\n   friendship till I found that there was something in\r\n   it that displeased you,--and, after learning that, I\r\n   discouraged it. You have said that he is my lover, but\r\n   you have probably not defined for yourself that word very\r\n   clearly. You have felt yourself slighted because his name\r\n   has been mentioned with praise;--and your jealousy has\r\n   been wounded because you have thought that I have regarded\r\n   him as in some way superior to yourself. You have never\r\n   really thought that he was my lover,--that he spoke words\r\n   to me which others might not hear, that he claimed from\r\n   me aught that a wife may not give, that he received aught\r\n   which a friend should not receive. The accusation has been\r\n   a coward\'s accusation.\r\n\r\n   I shall be at my father\'s to-night, and to-morrow I will\r\n   get you to let my servant bring to me such things as are\r\n   my own,--my clothes, namely, and desk, and a few books.\r\n   She will know what I want. I trust you may be happier\r\n   without a wife, than ever you have been with me. I have\r\n   felt almost daily since we were married that you were a\r\n   man who would have been happier without a wife than with\r\n   one.\r\n\r\n   Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n   LAURA KENNEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\n"It is at any rate true," she said, when Phineas had read the letter.\r\n\r\n"True! Doubtless it is true," said Phineas, "except that I do not\r\nsuppose he was ever really angry with me, or jealous, or anything of\r\nthe sort,--because I got on well. It seems absurd even to think it."\r\n\r\n"There is nothing too absurd for some men. I remember your telling\r\nme that he was weak, and poor, and unworthy. I remember your saying\r\nso when I first thought that he might become my husband. I wish I\r\nhad believed you when you told me so. I should not have made such a\r\nshipwreck of myself as I have done. That is all I had to say to you.\r\nAfter what has passed between us I did not choose that you should\r\nhear how I was separated from my husband from any lips but my own.\r\nI will go now and find papa. Do not come with me. I prefer being\r\nalone." Then he was left standing by himself, looking down upon the\r\nriver as it glided by. How would it have been with both of them if\r\nLady Laura had accepted him three years ago, when she consented to\r\njoin her lot with that of Mr. Kennedy, and had rejected him? As he\r\nstood he heard the sound of music from the house, and remembered\r\nthat he had come there with the one sole object of seeing Violet\r\nEffingham. He had known that he would meet Lady Laura, and it had\r\nbeen in his mind to break through that law of silence which she had\r\nimposed upon him, and once more to ask her to assist him,--to implore\r\nher for the sake of their old friendship to tell him whether there\r\nmight yet be for him any chance of success. But in the interview\r\nwhich had just taken place it had been impossible for him to speak\r\na word of himself or of Violet. To her, in her great desolation,\r\nhe could address himself on no other subject than that of her own\r\nmisery. But not the less when she was talking to him of her own\r\nsorrow, of her regret that she had not listened to him when in years\r\npast he had spoken slightingly of Mr. Kennedy, was he thinking of\r\nViolet Effingham. Mr. Kennedy had certainly mistaken the signs of\r\nthings when he had accused his wife by saying that Phineas was her\r\nlover. Phineas had soon got over that early feeling; and as far as he\r\nhimself was concerned had never regretted Lady Laura\'s marriage.\r\n\r\nHe remained down by the water for a few minutes, giving Lady Laura\r\ntime to escape, and then he wandered across the grounds towards the\r\nhouse. It was now about nine o\'clock, and though there were still\r\nmany walking about the grounds, the crowd of people were in the\r\nrooms. The musicians were ranged out on a verandah, so that their\r\nmusic might have been available for dancing within or without; but\r\nthe dancers had found the boards pleasanter than the lawn, and the\r\nDuke\'s garden party was becoming a mere ball, with privilege for the\r\ndancers to stroll about the lawn between the dances. And in this\r\nrespect the fun was better than at a ball,--that let the engagements\r\nmade for partners be what they might, they could always be broken\r\nwith ease. No lady felt herself bound to dance with a cavalier who\r\nwas displeasing to her; and some gentlemen were left sadly in the\r\nlurch. Phineas felt himself to be very much in the lurch, even after\r\nhe had discovered Violet Effingham standing up to dance with Lord\r\nFawn.\r\n\r\nHe bided his time patiently, and at last he found his opportunity.\r\n"Would she dance with him?" She declared that she intended to dance\r\nno more, and that she had promised to be ready to return home with\r\nLord Brentford before ten o\'clock. "I have pledged myself not to be\r\nafter ten," she said, laughing. Then she put her hand upon his arm,\r\nand they stepped out upon the terrace together. "Have you heard\r\nanything?" she asked him, almost in a whisper.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said. "I have heard what you mean. I have heard it all."\r\n\r\n"Is it not dreadful?"\r\n\r\n"I fear it is the best thing she can do. She has never been happy\r\nwith him."\r\n\r\n"But to be accused after that fashion,--by her husband!" said Violet.\r\n"One can hardly believe it in these days. And of all women she is the\r\nlast to deserve such accusation."\r\n\r\n"The very last," said Phineas, feeling that the subject was one upon\r\nwhich it was not easy for him to speak.\r\n\r\n"I cannot conceive to whom he can have alluded," said Violet. Then\r\nPhineas began to understand that Violet had not heard the whole\r\nstory; but the difficulty of speaking was still very great.\r\n\r\n"It has been the result of ungovernable temper," he said.\r\n\r\n"But a man does not usually strive to dishonour himself because he\r\nis in a rage. And this man is incapable of rage. He must be cursed\r\nwith one of those dark gloomy minds in which love always leads to\r\njealousy. She will never return to him."\r\n\r\n"One cannot say. In many respects it would be better that she\r\nshould," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"She will never return to him," repeated Violet,--"never. Would you\r\nadvise her to do so?"\r\n\r\n"How can I say? If one were called upon for advice, one would think\r\nso much before one spoke."\r\n\r\n"I would not,--not for a minute. What! to be accused of that! How are\r\na man and woman to live together after there have been such words\r\nbetween them? Poor Laura! What a terrible end to all her high hopes!\r\nDo you not grieve for her?"\r\n\r\nThey were now at some distance from the house, and Phineas could not\r\nbut feel that chance had been very good to him in giving him his\r\nopportunity. She was leaning on his arm, and they were alone, and she\r\nwas speaking to him with all the familiarity of old friendship. "I\r\nwonder whether I may change the subject," said he, "and ask you a\r\nword about yourself?"\r\n\r\n"What word?" she said sharply.\r\n\r\n"I have heard--"\r\n\r\n"What have you heard?"\r\n\r\n"Simply this,--that you are not now as you were six months ago. Your\r\nmarriage was then fixed for June."\r\n\r\n"It has been unfixed since then," she said.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--it has been unfixed. I know it. Miss Effingham, you will not\r\nbe angry with me if I say that when I heard it was so, something of a\r\nhope,--no, I must not call it a hope,--something that longed to form\r\nitself into hope returned to my breast, and from that hour to this\r\nhas been the only subject on which I have cared to think."\r\n\r\n"Lord Chiltern is your friend, Mr. Finn?"\r\n\r\n"He is so, and I do not think that I have ever been untrue to my\r\nfriendship for him."\r\n\r\n"He says that no man has ever had a truer friend. He will swear to\r\nthat in all companies. And I, when it was allowed to me to swear with\r\nhim, swore it too. As his friend, let me tell you one thing,--one\r\nthing which I would never tell to any other man,--one thing which I\r\nknow I may tell you in confidence. You are a gentleman, and will not\r\nbreak my confidence?"\r\n\r\n"I think I will not."\r\n\r\n"I know you will not, because you are a gentleman. I told Lord\r\nChiltern in the autumn of last year that I loved him. And I did love\r\nhim. I shall never have the same confession to make to another man.\r\nThat he and I are not now,--on those loving terms,--which once\r\nexisted, can make no difference in that. A woman cannot transfer her\r\nheart. There have been things which have made me feel,--that I was\r\nperhaps mistaken,--in saying that I would be,--his wife. But I said\r\nso, and cannot now give myself to another. Here is Lord Brentford,\r\nand we will join him." There was Lord Brentford with Lady Laura on\r\nhis arm, very gloomy,--resolving on what way he might be avenged on\r\nthe man who had insulted his daughter. He took but little notice\r\nof Phineas as he resumed his charge of Miss Effingham; but the two\r\nladies wished him good night.\r\n\r\n"Good night, Lady Laura," said Phineas, standing with his hat in his\r\nhand,--"good night, Miss Effingham." Then he was alone,--quite alone.\r\nWould it not be well for him to go down to the bottom of the garden,\r\nand fling himself into the quiet river, so that there might be an\r\nend of him? Or would it not be better still that he should create\r\nfor himself some quiet river of life, away from London, away from\r\npolitics, away from lords, and titled ladies, and fashionable\r\nsquares, and the parties given by dukes, and the disappointments\r\nincident to a small man in attempting to make for himself a career\r\namong big men? There had frequently been in the mind of this young\r\nman an idea that there was something almost false in his own\r\nposition,--that his life was a pretence, and that he would ultimately\r\nbe subject to that ruin which always comes, sooner or later, on\r\nthings which are false; and now as he wandered alone about Lady\r\nGlencora\'s gardens, this feeling was very strong within his bosom,\r\nand robbed him altogether of the honour and glory of having been one\r\nof the Duke of Omnium\'s guests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet Minister at Killaloe\r\n\r\n\r\nPhineas did not throw himself into the river from the Duke\'s garden;\r\nand was ready, in spite of Violet Effingham, to start for Ireland\r\nwith Mr. Monk at the end of the first week in August. The close of\r\nthat season in London certainly was not a happy period of his life.\r\nViolet had spoken to him after such a fashion that he could not bring\r\nhimself not to believe her. She had given him no hint whether it was\r\nlikely or unlikely that she and Lord Chiltern would be reconciled;\r\nbut she had convinced him that he could not be allowed to take Lord\r\nChiltern\'s place. "A woman cannot transfer her heart," she had said.\r\nPhineas was well aware that many women do transfer their hearts;\r\nbut he had gone to this woman too soon after the wrench which her\r\nlove had received; he had been too sudden with his proposal for a\r\ntransfer; and the punishment for such ill judgment must be that\r\nsuccess would now be impossible to him. And yet how could he have\r\nwaited, feeling that Miss Effingham, if she were at all like other\r\ngirls whom he had known, might have promised herself to some other\r\nlover before she would return within his reach in the succeeding\r\nspring? But she was not like some other girls. Ah;--he knew that now,\r\nand repented him of his haste.\r\n\r\nBut he was ready for Mr. Monk on the 7th of August, and they started\r\ntogether. Something less than twenty hours took them from London to\r\nKillaloe, and during four or five of those twenty hours Mr. Monk\r\nwas unfitted for any conversation by the uncomfortable feelings\r\nincidental to the passage from Holyhead to Kingstown. Nevertheless,\r\nthere was a great deal of conversation between them during the\r\njourney. Mr. Monk had almost made up his mind to leave the Cabinet.\r\n"It is sad to me to have to confess it," he said, "but the truth is\r\nthat my old rival, Turnbull, is right. A man who begins his political\r\nlife as I began mine, is not the man of whom a Minister should\r\nbe formed. I am inclined to think that Ministers of Government\r\nrequire almost as much education in their trade as shoemakers or\r\ntallow-chandlers. I doubt whether you can make a good public servant\r\nof a man simply because he has got the ear of the House of Commons."\r\n\r\n"Then you mean to say," said Phineas, "that we are altogether wrong\r\nfrom beginning to end, in our way of arranging these things?"\r\n\r\n"I do not say that at all. Look at the men who have been leading\r\nstatesmen since our present mode of government was formed,--from the\r\ndays in which it was forming itself, say from Walpole down, and you\r\nwill find that all who have been of real use had early training as\r\npublic servants."\r\n\r\n"Are we never to get out of the old groove?"\r\n\r\n"Not if the groove is good," said Mr. Monk, "Those who have been\r\nefficient as ministers sucked in their efficacy with their mother\'s\r\nmilk. Lord Brock did so, and Lord de Terrier, and Mr. Mildmay. They\r\nseated themselves in office chairs the moment they left college.\r\nMr. Gresham was in office before he was eight-and-twenty. The\r\nDuke of St. Bungay was at work as a Private Secretary when he was\r\nthree-and-twenty. You, luckily for yourself, have done the same."\r\n\r\n"And regret it every hour of my life."\r\n\r\n"You have no cause for regret, but it is not so with me. If there be\r\nany man unfitted by his previous career for office, it is he who has\r\nbecome, or who has endeavoured to become, a popular politician,--an\r\nexponent, if I may say so, of public opinion. As far as I can see,\r\noffice is offered to such men with one view only,--that of clipping\r\ntheir wings."\r\n\r\n"And of obtaining their help."\r\n\r\n"It is the same thing. Help from Turnbull would mean the withdrawal\r\nof all power of opposition from him. He could not give other help for\r\nany long term, as the very fact of his accepting power and patronage\r\nwould take from him his popular leadership. The masses outside\r\nrequire to have their minister as the Queen has hers; but the same\r\nman cannot be minister to both. If the people\'s minister chooses to\r\nchange his master, and to take the Queen\'s shilling, something of\r\ntemporary relief may be gained by government in the fact that the\r\nother place will for a time be vacant. But there are candidates\r\nenough for such places, and the vacancy is not a vacancy long. Of\r\ncourse the Crown has this pull, that it pays wages, and the people do\r\nnot."\r\n\r\n"I do not think that that influenced you," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"It did not influence me. To you I will make bold to state so much\r\npositively, though it would be foolish, perhaps, to do so to others.\r\nI did not go for the shilling, though I am so poor a man that the\r\nshilling is more to me than it would be to almost any man in the\r\nHouse. I took the shilling, much doubting, but guided in part by\r\nthis, that I was ashamed of being afraid to take it. They told\r\nme,--Mr. Mildmay and the Duke,--that I could earn it to the benefit\r\nof the country. I have not earned it, and the country has not been\r\nbenefited,--unless it be for the good of the country that my voice in\r\nthe House should be silenced. If I believe that, I ought to hold my\r\ntongue without taking a salary for holding it. I have made a mistake,\r\nmy friend. Such mistakes made at my time of life cannot be wholly\r\nrectified; but, being convinced of my error, I must do the best in my\r\npower to put myself right again."\r\n\r\nThere was a bitterness in all this to Phineas himself of which he\r\ncould not but make plaint to his companion. "The truth is," he said,\r\n"that a man in office must be a slave, and that slavery is\r\ndistasteful."\r\n\r\n"There I think you are wrong. If you mean that you cannot do joint\r\nwork with other men altogether after your own fashion the same may be\r\nsaid of all work. If you had stuck to the Bar you must have pleaded\r\nyour causes in conformity with instructions from the attorneys."\r\n\r\n"I should have been guided by my own lights in advising those\r\nattorneys."\r\n\r\n"I cannot see that you suffer anything that ought to go against the\r\ngrain with you. You are beginning young, and it is your first adopted\r\ncareer. With me it is otherwise. If by my telling you this I shall\r\nhave led you astray, I shall regret my openness with you. Could I\r\nbegin again, I would willingly begin as you began."\r\n\r\nIt was a great day in Killaloe, that on which Mr. Monk arrived with\r\nPhineas at the doctor\'s house. In London, perhaps, a bishop inspires\r\nmore awe than a Cabinet Minister. In Killaloe, where a bishop might\r\nbe seen walking about every day, the mitred dignitary of the Church,\r\nthough much loved, was thought of, I fear, but lightly; whereas a\r\nCabinet Minister coming to stay in the house of a townsman was a\r\nthing to be wondered at, to be talked about, to be afraid of, to be\r\na fruitful source of conversation for a year to come. There were\r\nmany in Killaloe, especially among the elder ladies, who had shaken\r\ntheir heads and expressed the saddest doubts when young Phineas Finn\r\nhad first become a Parliament man. And though by degrees they had\r\nbeen half brought round, having been driven to acknowledge that he\r\nhad been wonderfully successful as a Parliament man, still they\r\nhad continued to shake their heads among themselves, and to fear\r\nsomething in the future,--until he appeared at his old home leading a\r\nCabinet Minister by the hand. There was such assurance in this that\r\neven old Mrs. Callaghan, at the brewery, gave way, and began to say\r\nall manner of good things, and to praise the doctor\'s luck in that he\r\nhad a son gifted with parts so excellent. There was a great desire to\r\nsee the Cabinet Minister in the flesh, to be with him when he ate and\r\ndrank, to watch the gait and countenance of the man, and to drink\r\nwater from this fountain of state lore which had been so wonderfully\r\nbrought among them by their young townsman. Mrs. Finn was aware that\r\nit behoved her to be chary of her invitations, but the lady from the\r\nbrewery had said such good things of Mrs. Finn\'s black swan, that she\r\ncarried her point, and was invited to meet the Cabinet Minister at\r\ndinner on the day after his arrival.\r\n\r\nMrs. Flood Jones and her daughter were invited also to be of the\r\nparty. When Phineas had been last at Killaloe, Mrs. Flood Jones,\r\nas the reader may remember, had remained with her daughter at\r\nFloodborough,--feeling it to be her duty to keep her daughter away\r\nfrom the danger of an unrequited attachment. But it seemed that\r\nher purpose was changed now, or that she no longer feared the\r\ndanger,--for both Mary and her mother were now again living in\r\nKillaloe, and Mary was at the doctor\'s house as much as ever.\r\n\r\nA day or two before the coming of the god and the demigod to the\r\nlittle town, Barbara Finn and her friend had thus come to understand\r\neach other as they walked along the Shannon side. "I am sure, my\r\ndear, that he is engaged to nobody," said Barbara Finn.\r\n\r\n"And I am sure, my dear," said Mary, "that I do not care whether he\r\nis or is not."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, Mary?"\r\n\r\n"I mean what I say. Why should I care? Five years ago I had a foolish\r\ndream, and now I am awake again. Think how old I have got to be!"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--you are twenty-three. What has that to do with it?"\r\n\r\n"It has this to do with it;--that I am old enough to know better.\r\nMamma and I quite understand each other. She used to be angry with\r\nhim, but she has got over all that foolishness now. It always made me\r\nso vexed;--the idea of being angry with a man because,--because--!\r\nYou know one can\'t talk about it, it is so foolish. But that is all\r\nover now."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say you don\'t care for him, Mary? Do you remember\r\nwhat you used to swear to me less than two years ago?"\r\n\r\n"I remember it all very well, and I remember what a goose I was. As\r\nfor caring for him, of course I do,--because he is your brother, and\r\nbecause I have known him all my life. But if he were going to be\r\nmarried to-morrow, you would see that it would make no difference to\r\nme."\r\n\r\nBarbara Finn walked on for a couple of minutes in silence before she\r\nreplied. "Mary," she said at last, "I don\'t believe a word of it."\r\n\r\n"Very well;--then all that I shall ask of you is, that we may not\r\ntalk about him any more. Mamma believes it, and that is enough for\r\nme." Nevertheless, they did talk about Phineas during the whole of\r\nthat day, and very often talked about him afterwards, as long as Mary\r\nremained at Killaloe.\r\n\r\nThere was a large dinner party at the doctor\'s on the day after Mr.\r\nMonk\'s arrival. The bishop was not there, though he was on terms\r\nsufficiently friendly with the doctor\'s family to have been invited\r\non so grand an occasion; but he was not there, because Mrs. Finn\r\nwas determined that she would be taken out to dinner by a Cabinet\r\nMinister in the face of all her friends. She was aware that had the\r\nbishop been there, she must have taken the bishop\'s arm. And though\r\nthere would have been glory in that, the other glory was more to her\r\ntaste. It was the first time in her life that she had ever seen a\r\nCabinet Minister, and I think that she was a little disappointed at\r\nfinding him so like other middle-aged gentlemen. She had hoped that\r\nMr. Monk would have assumed something of the dignity of his position;\r\nbut he assumed nothing. Now the bishop, though he was a very mild\r\nman, did assume something by the very facts of his apron and\r\nknee-breeches.\r\n\r\n"I am sure, sir, it is very good of you to come and put up with our\r\nhumble way of living," said Mrs. Finn to her guest, as they sat down\r\nat table. And yet she had resolved that she would not make any speech\r\nof the kind,--that she would condescend to no apology,--that she\r\nwould bear herself as though a Cabinet Minister dined with her at\r\nleast once a year. But when the moment came, she broke down, and made\r\nthis apology with almost abject meekness, and then hated herself\r\nbecause she had done so.\r\n\r\n"My dear madam," said Mr. Monk, "I live myself so much like a hermit\r\nthat your house is a palace of luxury to me." Then he felt that he\r\nhad made a foolish speech, and he also hated himself. He found it\r\nvery difficult to talk to his hostess upon any subject, until by\r\nchance he mentioned his young friend Phineas. Then her tongue was\r\nunloosed. "Your son, madam," he said, "is going with me to Limerick\r\nand back to Dublin. It is a shame, I know, taking him so soon away\r\nfrom home, but I should not know how to get on without him."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Monk, it is such a blessing for him, and such an honour for\r\nus, that you should be so good to him." Then the mother spoke out\r\nall her past fears and all her present hopes, and acknowledged the\r\ngreat glory which it was to her to have a son sitting in Parliament,\r\nholding an office with a stately name and a great salary, and blessed\r\nwith the friendship of such a man as Mr. Monk. After that Mr. Monk\r\ngot on better with her.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know any young man," said he, "in whose career I have taken\r\nso strong an interest."\r\n\r\n"He was always good," said Mrs. Finn, with a tear forcing itself into\r\nthe corner of each eye. "I am his mother, and of course I ought not\r\nto say so,--not in this way; but it is true, Mr. Monk." And then the\r\npoor lady was obliged to raise her handkerchief and wipe away the\r\ndrops.\r\n\r\nPhineas on this occasion had taken out to dinner the mother of his\r\ndevoted Mary, Mrs. Flood Jones. "What a pleasure it must be to the\r\ndoctor and Mrs. Finn to see you come back in this way," said Mrs.\r\nFlood Jones.\r\n\r\n"With all my bones unbroken?" said he, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Yes; with all your bones unbroken. You know, Phineas, when we\r\nfirst heard that you were to sit in Parliament, we were afraid that\r\nyou might break a rib or two,--since you choose to talk about the\r\nbreaking of bones."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know. Everybody thought I should come to grief; but nobody\r\nfelt so sure of it as I did myself."\r\n\r\n"But you have not come to grief."\r\n\r\n"I am not out of the wood yet, you know, Mrs. Flood Jones. There is\r\nplenty of possibility for grief in my way still."\r\n\r\n"As far as I can understand it, you are out of the wood. All that\r\nyour friends here want to see now is, that you should marry some nice\r\nEnglish girl, with a little money, if possible. Rumours have reached\r\nus, you know."\r\n\r\n"Rumours always lie," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes they do, of course; and I am not going to ask any\r\nindiscreet questions. But that is what we all hope. Mary was saying,\r\nonly the other day, that if you were once married, we should all\r\nfeel quite safe about you. And you know we all take the most lively\r\ninterest in your welfare. It is not every day that a man from County\r\nClare gets on as you have done, and therefore we are bound to think\r\nof you." Thus Mrs. Flood Jones signified to Phineas Finn that she had\r\nforgiven him the thoughtlessness of his early youth,--even though\r\nthere had been something of treachery in that thoughtlessness to her\r\nown daughter; and showed him, also, that whatever Mary\'s feelings\r\nmight have been once, they were not now of a nature to trouble her.\r\n"Of course you will marry?" said Mrs. Flood Jones.\r\n\r\n"I should think very likely not," said Phineas, who perhaps looked\r\nfarther into the mind of the lady than the lady intended.\r\n\r\n"Oh, do," said the lady. "Every man should marry as soon as he can,\r\nand especially a man in your position."\r\n\r\nWhen the ladies met together in the drawing-room after dinner,\r\nit was impossible but that they should discuss Mr. Monk. There\r\nwas Mrs. Callaghan from the brewery there, and old Lady Blood, of\r\nBloodstone,--who on ordinary occasions would hardly admit that she\r\nwas on dining-out terms with any one in Killaloe except the bishop,\r\nbut who had found it impossible to decline to meet a Cabinet\r\nMinister,--and there was Mrs. Stackpoole from Sixmiletown, a far-away\r\ncousin of the Finns, who hated Lady Blood with a true provincial\r\nhatred.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see anything particularly uncommon in him, after all," said\r\nLady Blood.\r\n\r\n"I think he is very nice indeed," said Mrs. Flood Jones.\r\n\r\n"So very quiet, my dear, and just like other people," said Mrs.\r\nCallaghan, meaning to pronounce a strong eulogium on the Cabinet\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n"Very like other people indeed," said Lady Blood.\r\n\r\n"And what would you expect, Lady Blood?" said Mrs. Stackpoole. "Men\r\nand women in London walk upon two legs, just as they do in Ennis."\r\nNow Lady Blood herself had been born and bred in Ennis, whereas Mrs.\r\nStackpoole had come from Limerick, which is a much more considerable\r\ntown, and therefore there was a satire in this allusion to the habits\r\nof the men of Ennis which Lady Blood understood thoroughly.\r\n\r\n"My dear Mrs. Stackpoole, I know how the people walk in London quite\r\nas well as you do." Lady Blood had once passed three months in London\r\nwhile Sir Patrick had been alive, whereas Mrs. Stackpoole had never\r\ndone more than visit the metropolis for a day or two.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no doubt," said Mrs. Stackpoole; "but I never can understand\r\nwhat it is that people expect. I suppose Mr. Monk ought to have\r\ncome with his stars on the breast of his coat, to have pleased Lady\r\nBlood."\r\n\r\n"My dear Mrs. Stackpoole, Cabinet Ministers don\'t have stars," said\r\nLady Blood.\r\n\r\n"I never said they did," said Mrs. Stackpoole.\r\n\r\n"He is so nice and gentle to talk to," said Mrs. Finn. "You may say\r\nwhat you will, but men who are high up do very often give themselves\r\nairs. Now I must say that this friend of my son\'s does not do\r\nanything of that kind."\r\n\r\n"Not the least," said Mrs. Callaghan.\r\n\r\n"Quite the contrary," said Mrs. Stackpoole.\r\n\r\n"I dare say he is a wonderful man," said Lady Blood. "All I say is,\r\nthat I didn\'t hear anything wonderful come out of his mouth; and\r\nas for people in Ennis walking on two legs, I have seen donkeys in\r\nLimerick doing just the same thing." Now it was well known that Mrs.\r\nStackpoole had two sons living in Limerick, as to neither of whom\r\nwas it expected that he would set the Shannon on fire. After this\r\nlittle speech there was no further mention of Mr. Monk, as it became\r\nnecessary that all the good-nature of Mrs. Finn and all the tact\r\nof Mrs. Flood Jones and all the energy of Mrs. Callaghan should be\r\nused, to prevent the raging of an internecine battle between Mrs.\r\nStackpoole and Lady Blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI\r\n\r\nVictrix\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Monk\'s holiday programme allowed him a week at Killaloe, and\r\nfrom thence he was to go to Limerick, and from Limerick to Dublin,\r\nin order that, at both places, he might be entertained at a public\r\ndinner and make a speech about tenant-right. Foreseeing that Phineas\r\nmight commit himself if he attended these meetings, Mr. Monk had\r\ncounselled him to remain at Killaloe. But Phineas had refused to\r\nsubject himself to such cautious abstinence. Mr. Monk had come to\r\nIreland as his friend, and he would see him through his travels. "I\r\nshall not, probably, be asked to speak," said Phineas, "and if I am\r\nasked, I need not say more than a few words. And what if I did speak\r\nout?"\r\n\r\n"You might find it disadvantageous to you in London."\r\n\r\n"I must take my chance of that. I am not going to tie myself down for\r\never and ever for the sake of being Under-Secretary to the Colonies."\r\nMr. Monk said very much to him on the subject,--was constantly saying\r\nvery much to him about it; but in spite of all that Mr. Monk said,\r\nPhineas did make the journey to Limerick and Dublin.\r\n\r\nHe had not, since his arrival at Killaloe, been a moment alone with\r\nMary Flood Jones till the evening before he started with Mr. Monk.\r\nShe had kept out of his way successfully, though she had constantly\r\nbeen with him in company, and was beginning to plume herself on the\r\nstrength and valour of her conduct. But her self-praise had in it\r\nnothing of joy, and her glory was very sad. Of course she would care\r\nfor him no more,--more especially as it was so very evident that he\r\ncared not at all for her. But the very fact of her keeping out of\r\nhis way, made her acknowledge to herself that her position was very\r\nmiserable. She had declared to her mother that she might certainly\r\ngo to Killaloe with safety,--that it would be better for her to put\r\nherself in the way of meeting him as an old friend,--that the idea of\r\nthe necessity of shutting herself up because of his approach, was the\r\none thing that gave her real pain. Therefore her mother had brought\r\nher to Killaloe and she had met him; but her fancied security had\r\ndeserted her, and she found herself to be miserable, hoping for\r\nsomething she did not know what, still dreaming of possibilities,\r\nfeeling during every moment of his presence with her that some\r\nspecial conduct was necessary on her part. She could not make further\r\nconfession to her mother and ask to be carried back to Floodborough;\r\nbut she knew that she was very wretched at Killaloe.\r\n\r\nAs for Phineas, he had felt that his old friend was very cold to him.\r\nHe was in that humour with reference to Violet Effingham which seemed\r\nespecially to require consolation. He knew now that all hope was\r\nover there. Violet Effingham could never be his wife. Even were she\r\nnot to marry Lord Chiltern for the next five years, she would not,\r\nduring those five years, marry any other man. Such was our hero\'s\r\nconviction; and, suffering under this conviction, he was in want of\r\nthe comfort of feminine sympathy. Had Mary known all this, and had it\r\nsuited her to play such a part, I think she might have had Phineas\r\nat her feet before he had been a week at home. But she had kept\r\naloof from him and had heard nothing of his sorrows. As a natural\r\nconsequence of this, Phineas was more in love with her than ever.\r\n\r\nOn the evening before he started with Mr. Monk for Limerick, he\r\nmanaged to be alone with her for a few minutes. Barbara may probably\r\nhave assisted in bringing about this arrangement, and had, perhaps,\r\nbeen guilty of some treachery,--sisters in such circumstances will\r\nsometimes be very treacherous to their friends. I feel sure, however,\r\nthat Mary herself was quite innocent of any guile in the matter.\r\n"Mary," Phineas said to her suddenly, "it seems to me that you have\r\navoided me purposely ever since I have been at home." She smiled and\r\nblushed, and stammered and said nothing. "Has there been any reason\r\nfor it, Mary?"\r\n\r\n"No reason at all that I know of," she said.\r\n\r\n"We used to be such great friends."\r\n\r\n"That was before you were a great man, Phineas. It must necessarily\r\nbe different now. You know so many people now, and people of such a\r\ndifferent sort, that of course I fall a little into the background."\r\n\r\n"When you talk in that way, Mary, I know that you are laughing at\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, indeed I am not."\r\n\r\n"I believe there is no one in the whole world," he said, after a\r\npause, "whose friendship is more to me than yours is. I think of it\r\nso often, Mary. Say that when we come back it shall be between us as\r\nit used to be." Then he put out his hand for hers, and she could not\r\nhelp giving it to him. "Of course there will be people," he said,\r\n"who talk nonsense, and one cannot help it; but I will not put up\r\nwith it from you."\r\n\r\n"I did not mean to talk nonsense, Phineas!" Then there came some one\r\nacross them, and the conversation was ended; but the sound of his\r\nvoice remained on her ears, and she could not help but remember\r\nthat he had declared that her friendship was dearer to him than the\r\nfriendship of any one else.\r\n\r\nPhineas went with Mr. Monk first to Limerick and then to Dublin, and\r\nfound himself at both places to be regarded as a hero only second\r\nto the great hero. At both places the one subject of debate was\r\ntenant-right;--could anything be done to make it profitable for men\r\nwith capital to put their capital into Irish land? The fertility of\r\nthe soil was questioned by no one,--nor the sufficiency of external\r\ncircumstances, such as railroads and the like;--nor the abundance of\r\nlabour;--nor even security for the wealth to be produced. The only\r\ndifficulty was in this, that the men who were to produce the wealth\r\nhad no guarantee that it would be theirs when it was created. In\r\nEngland and elsewhere such guarantees were in existence. Might it not\r\nbe possible to introduce them into Ireland? That was the question\r\nwhich Mr. Monk had in hand; and in various speeches which he made\r\nboth before and after the dinners given to him, he pledged himself to\r\nkeep it well in hand when Parliament should meet. Of course Phineas\r\nspoke also. It was impossible that he should be silent when his\r\nfriend and leader was pouring out his eloquence. Of course he spoke,\r\nand of course he pledged himself. Something like the old pleasures\r\nof the debating society returned to him, as standing upon a platform\r\nbefore a listening multitude, he gave full vent to his words. In\r\nthe House of Commons, of late he had been so cabined, cribbed, and\r\nconfined by office as to have enjoyed nothing of this. Indeed, from\r\nthe commencement of his career, he had fallen so thoroughly into the\r\ndecorum of Government ways, as to have missed altogether the delights\r\nof that wild irresponsible oratory of which Mr. Monk had spoken\r\nto him so often. He had envied men below the gangway, who, though\r\nsupporting the Government on main questions, could get up on their\r\nlegs whenever the House was full enough to make it worth their while,\r\nand say almost whatever they pleased. There was that Mr. Robson, who\r\nliterally did say just what came uppermost; and the thing that came\r\nuppermost was often ill-natured, often unbecoming the gravity of the\r\nHouse, was always startling; but men listened to him and liked him to\r\nspeak. But Mr. Robson had--married a woman with money. Oh, why,--why,\r\nhad not Violet Effingham been kinder to him? He might even yet,\r\nperhaps, marry a woman with money. But he could not bring himself to\r\ndo so unless he loved her.\r\n\r\nThe upshot of the Dublin meeting was that he also positively pledged\r\nhimself to support during the next session of Parliament a bill\r\nadvocating tenant-right. "I am sorry you went so far as that," Mr.\r\nMonk said to him almost as soon as the meeting was over. They were\r\nstanding on the pier at Kingstown, and Mr. Monk was preparing to\r\nreturn to England.\r\n\r\n"And why not I as far as you?"\r\n\r\n"Because I had thought about it, and I do not think that you have. I\r\nam prepared to resign my office to-morrow; and directly that I can\r\nsee Mr. Gresham and explain to him what I have done, I shall offer to\r\ndo so."\r\n\r\n"He won\'t accept your resignation."\r\n\r\n"He must accept it, unless he is prepared to instruct the Irish\r\nSecretary to bring in such a bill as I can support."\r\n\r\n"I shall be exactly in the same boat."\r\n\r\n"But you ought not to be in the same boat;--nor need you. My advice\r\nto you is to say nothing about it till you get back to London, and\r\nthen speak to Lord Cantrip. Tell him that you will not say anything\r\non the subject in the House, but that in the event of there being a\r\ndivision you hope to be allowed to vote as on an open question. It\r\nmay be that I shall get Gresham\'s assent, and if so we shall be all\r\nright. If I do not, and if they choose to make it a point with you,\r\nyou must resign also."\r\n\r\n"Of course I shall," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"But I do not think they will. You have been too useful, and they\r\nwill wish to avoid the weakness which comes to a ministry from\r\nchanging its team. Good-bye, my dear fellow; and remember this,--my\r\nlast word of advice to you is to stick by the ship. I am quite sure\r\nit is a career which will suit you. I did not begin it soon enough."\r\n\r\nPhineas was rather melancholy as he returned alone to Killaloe. It\r\nwas all very well to bid him stick to the ship, and he knew as well\r\nas any one could tell him how material the ship was to him; but there\r\nare circumstances in which a man cannot stick to his ship,--cannot\r\nstick, at least, to this special Government ship. He knew that\r\nwhither Mr. Monk went, in this session, he must follow. He had\r\nconsiderable hope that when Mr. Monk explained his purpose to the\r\nPrime Minister, the Prime Minister would feel himself obliged to give\r\nway. In that case Phineas would not only be able to keep his office,\r\nbut would have such an opportunity of making a speech in Parliament\r\nas circumstances had never yet given to him. When he was again at\r\nhome he said nothing to his father or to the Killaloeians as to the\r\ndanger of his position. Of what use would it be to make his mother\r\nand sisters miserable, or to incur the useless counsels of the\r\ndoctor? They seemed to think his speech at Dublin very fine, and were\r\nnever tired of talking of what Mr. Monk and Phineas were going to do;\r\nbut the idea had not come home to them that if Mr. Monk or Phineas\r\nchose to do anything on their own account, they must give up the\r\nplaces which they held under the Crown.\r\n\r\nIt was September when Phineas found himself back at Killaloe, and he\r\nwas due to be at his office in London in November. The excitement\r\nof Mr. Monk\'s company was now over, and he had nothing to do but to\r\nreceive pouches full of official papers from the Colonial Office, and\r\nstudy all the statistics which came within his reach in reference to\r\nthe proposed new law for tenant-right. In the meantime Mary was still\r\nliving with her mother at Killaloe, and still kept herself somewhat\r\naloof from the man she loved. How could it be possible for him not to\r\ngive way in such circumstances as those?\r\n\r\nOne day he found himself talking to her about himself, and speaking\r\nto her of his own position with more frankness than he ever used with\r\nhis own family. He had begun by reminding her of that conversation\r\nwhich they had had before he went away with Mr. Monk, and by\r\nreminding her also that she had promised to return to her old\r\nfriendly ways with him.\r\n\r\n"Nay, Phineas; there was no promise," she said.\r\n\r\n"And are we not to be friends?"\r\n\r\n"I only say that I made no particular promise. Of course we are\r\nfriends. We have always been friends."\r\n\r\n"What would you say if you heard that I had resigned my office and\r\ngiven up my seat?" he asked. Of course she expressed her surprise,\r\nalmost her horror, at such an idea, and then he told her everything.\r\nIt took long in the telling, because it was necessary that he should\r\nexplain to her the working of the system which made it impossible for\r\nhim, as a member of the Government, to entertain an opinion of his\r\nown.\r\n\r\n"And do you mean that you would lose your salary?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Certainly I should."\r\n\r\n"Would not that be very dreadful?"\r\n\r\nHe laughed as he acknowledged that it would be dreadful. "It is very\r\ndreadful, Mary, to have nothing to eat and drink. But what is a man\r\nto do? Would you recommend me to say that black is white?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure you will never do that."\r\n\r\n"You see, Mary, it is very nice to be called by a big name and to\r\nhave a salary, and it is very comfortable to be envied by one\'s\r\nfriends and enemies;--but there are drawbacks. There is this especial\r\ndrawback." Then he paused for a moment before he went on.\r\n\r\n"What especial drawback, Phineas?"\r\n\r\n"A man cannot do what he pleases with himself. How can a man marry,\r\nso circumstanced as I am?"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated for a moment, and then she answered him,--"A man may be\r\nvery happy without marrying, I suppose."\r\n\r\nHe also paused for many moments before he spoke again, and she then\r\nmade a faint attempt to escape from him. But before she succeeded he\r\nhad asked her a question which arrested her. "I wonder whether you\r\nwould listen to me if I were to tell you a history?" Of course she\r\nlistened, and the history he told her was the tale of his love for\r\nViolet Effingham.\r\n\r\n"And she has money of her own?" Mary asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--she is rich. She has a large fortune."\r\n\r\n"Then, Mr. Finn, you must seek some one else who is equally blessed."\r\n\r\n"Mary, that is untrue,--that is ill-natured. You do not mean that.\r\nSay that you do not mean it. You have not believed that I loved Miss\r\nEffingham because she was rich."\r\n\r\n"But you have told me that you could love no one who is not rich."\r\n\r\n"I have said nothing of the kind. Love is involuntary. It does not\r\noften run in a yoke with prudence. I have told you my history as\r\nfar as it is concerned with Violet Effingham. I did love her very\r\ndearly."\r\n\r\n"Did love her, Mr. Finn?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--did love her. Is there any inconstancy in ceasing to love when\r\none is not loved? Is there inconstancy in changing one\'s love, and in\r\nloving again?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know," said Mary, to whom the occasion was becoming so\r\nembarrassing that she no longer was able to reply with words that had\r\na meaning in them.\r\n\r\n"If there be, dear, I am inconstant." He paused, but of course she\r\nhad not a syllable to say. "I have changed my love. But I could not\r\nspeak of a new passion till I had told the story of that which has\r\npassed away. You have heard it all now, Mary. Can you try to love me,\r\nafter that?" It had come at last,--the thing for which she had been\r\never wishing. It had come in spite of her imprudence, and in spite of\r\nher prudence. When she had heard him to the end she was not a whit\r\nangry with him,--she was not in the least aggrieved,--because he had\r\nbeen lost to her in his love for this Miss Effingham, while she had\r\nbeen so nearly lost by her love for him. For women such episodes\r\nin the lives of their lovers have an excitement which is almost\r\npleasurable, whereas each man is anxious to hear his lady swear that\r\nuntil he appeared upon the scene her heart had been fancy free. Mary,\r\nupon the whole, had liked the story,--had thought that it had been\r\nfinely told, and was well pleased with the final catastrophe. But,\r\nnevertheless, she was not prepared with her reply. "Have you no\r\nanswer to give me, Mary?" he said, looking up into her eyes. I am\r\nafraid that he did not doubt what would be her answer,--as it would\r\nbe good that all lovers should do. "You must vouchsafe me some word,\r\nMary."\r\n\r\nWhen she essayed to speak she found that she was dumb. She could not\r\nget her voice to give her the assistance of a single word. She did\r\nnot cry, but there was a motion as of sobbing in her throat which\r\nimpeded all utterance. She was as happy as earth,--as heaven could\r\nmake her; but she did not know how to tell him that she was happy.\r\nAnd yet she longed to tell it, that he might know how thankful she\r\nwas to him for his goodness. He still sat looking at her, and now by\r\ndegrees he had got her hand in his. "Mary," he said, "will you be my\r\nwife,--my own wife?"\r\n\r\nWhen half an hour had passed, they were still together, and now she\r\nhad found the use of her tongue. "Do whatever you like best," she\r\nsaid. "I do not care which you do. If you came to me to-morrow and\r\ntold me you had no income, it would make no difference. Though to\r\nlove you and to have your love is all the world to me,--though it\r\nmakes all the difference between misery and happiness,--I would\r\nsooner give up that than be a clog on you." Then he took her in his\r\narms and kissed her. "Oh, Phineas!" she said, "I do love you so\r\nentirely!"\r\n\r\n"My own one!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; your own one. But if you had known it always! Never mind. Now\r\nyou are my own,--are you not?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed yes, dearest."\r\n\r\n"Oh, what a thing it is to be victorious at last."\r\n\r\n"What on earth are you two doing here these two hours together?" said\r\nBarbara, bursting into the room.\r\n\r\n"What are we doing?" said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--what are you doing?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing in particular," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"Nothing at all in particular," said Phineas. "Only this,--that we\r\nhave engaged ourselves to marry each other. It is quite a trifle,--is\r\nit not, Mary?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Barbara!" said the joyful girl, springing forward into her\r\nfriend\'s arms; "I do believe I am the happiest creature on the face\r\nof this earth!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII\r\n\r\nJob\'s Comforters\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Phineas had returned to London his engagement with Mary Flood\r\nJones was known to all his family, was known to Mrs. Flood Jones, and\r\nwas indeed known generally to all Killaloe. That other secret of his,\r\nwhich had reference to the probability of his being obliged to throw\r\nup his office, was known only to Mary herself. He thought that he had\r\ndone all that honour required of him in telling her of his position\r\nbefore he had proposed;--so that she might on that ground refuse\r\nhim if she were so minded. And yet he had known very well that such\r\nprudence on her part was not to be expected. If she loved him, of\r\ncourse she would say so when she was asked. And he had known that\r\nshe loved him. "There may be delay, Mary," he said to her as he was\r\ngoing; "nay, there must be delay, if I am obliged to resign."\r\n\r\n"I do not care a straw for delay if you will be true to me," she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"Do you doubt my truth, dearest?"\r\n\r\n"Not in the least. I will swear by it as the one thing that is truest\r\nin the world."\r\n\r\n"You may, dearest. And if this should come to pass I must go to work\r\nand put my shoulder to the wheel, and earn an income for you by my\r\nold profession before I can make you my wife. With such a motive\r\nbefore me I know that I shall earn an income." And thus they parted.\r\nMary, though of course she would have preferred that her future\r\nhusband should remain in his high office, that he should be a member\r\nof Parliament and an Under-Secretary of State, admitted no doubt\r\ninto her mind to disturb her happiness; and Phineas, though he had\r\nmany misgivings as to the prudence of what he had done, was not the\r\nless strong in his resolution of constancy and endurance. He would\r\nthrow up his position, resign his seat, and go to work at the Bar\r\ninstantly, if he found that his independence as a man required him to\r\ndo so. And, above all, let come what might, he would be true to Mary\r\nFlood Jones.\r\n\r\nDecember was half over before he saw Lord Cantrip. "Yes,--yes;" said\r\nLord Cantrip, when the Under-Secretary began to tell his story; "I\r\nsaw what you were about. I wish I had been at your elbow."\r\n\r\n"If you knew the country as I know it, you would be as eager about it\r\nas I am."\r\n\r\n"Then I can only say that I am very glad that I do not know the\r\ncountry as you know it. You see, Finn, it\'s my idea that if a man\r\nwants to make himself useful he should stick to some special kind of\r\nwork. With you it\'s a thousand pities that you should not do so."\r\n\r\n"You think, then, I ought to resign?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say anything about that. As you wish it, of course I\'ll\r\nspeak to Gresham. Monk, I believe, has resigned already."\r\n\r\n"He has written to me, and told me so," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"I always felt afraid of him for your sake, Finn. Mr. Monk is a\r\nclever man, and as honest a man as any in the House, but I always\r\nthought that he was a dangerous friend for you. However, we will see.\r\nI will speak to Gresham after Christmas. There is no hurry about it."\r\n\r\nWhen Parliament met the first great subject of interest was the\r\ndesertion of Mr. Monk from the Ministry. He at once took his place\r\nbelow the gangway, sitting as it happened exactly in front of Mr.\r\nTurnbull, and there he made his explanation. Some one opposite asked\r\na question whether a certain right honourable gentleman had not left\r\nthe Cabinet. Then Mr. Gresham replied that to his infinite regret his\r\nright honourable friend, who lately presided at the Board of Trade,\r\nhad resigned; and he went on to explain that this resignation had,\r\naccording to his ideas, been quite unnecessary. His right honourable\r\nfriend entertained certain ideas about Irish tenant-right, as to\r\nwhich he himself and his right honourable friend the Secretary for\r\nIreland could not exactly pledge themselves to be in unison with him;\r\nbut he had thought that the motion might have rested at any rate over\r\nthis session. Then Mr. Monk explained, making his first great speech\r\non Irish tenant-right. He found himself obliged to advocate some\r\nimmediate measure for giving security to the Irish farmer; and as he\r\ncould not do so as a member of the Cabinet, he was forced to resign\r\nthe honour of that position. He said something also as to the great\r\ndoubt which had ever weighed on his own mind as to the inexpediency\r\nof a man at his time of life submitting himself for the first time\r\nto the trammels of office. This called up Mr. Turnbull, who took\r\nthe opportunity of saying that he now agreed cordially with his old\r\nfriend for the first time since that old friend had listened to the\r\nblandishments of the ministerial seducer, and that he welcomed his\r\nold friend back to those independent benches with great satisfaction.\r\nIn this way the debate was very exciting. Nothing was said which made\r\nit then necessary for Phineas to get upon his legs or to declare\r\nhimself; but he perceived that the time would rapidly come in which\r\nhe must do so. Mr. Gresham, though he strove to speak with gentle\r\nwords, was evidently very angry with the late President of the Board\r\nof Trade; and, moreover, it was quite clear that a bill would be\r\nintroduced by Mr. Monk himself, which Mr. Gresham was determined\r\nto oppose. If all this came to pass and there should be a close\r\ndivision, Phineas felt that his fate would be sealed. When he again\r\nspoke to Lord Cantrip on the subject, the Secretary of State shrugged\r\nhis shoulders and shook his head. "I can only advise you," said Lord\r\nCantrip, "to forget all that took place in Ireland. If you will do\r\nso, nobody else will remember it." "As if it were possible to forget\r\nsuch things," he said in the letter which he wrote to Mary that\r\nnight. "Of course I shall go now. If it were not for your sake, I\r\nshould not in the least regret it."\r\n\r\nHe had been with Madame Goesler frequently in the winter, and had\r\ndiscussed with her so often the question of his official position\r\nthat she had declared that she was coming at last to understand the\r\nmysteries of an English Cabinet. "I think you are quite right, my\r\nfriend," she said,--"quite right. What--you are to be in Parliament\r\nand say that this black thing is white, or that this white thing is\r\nblack, because you like to take your salary! That cannot be honest!"\r\nThen, when he came to talk to her of money,--that he must give up\r\nParliament itself, if he gave up his place,--she offered to lend him\r\nmoney. "Why should you not treat me as a friend?" she said. When he\r\npointed out to her that there would never come a time in which he\r\ncould pay such money back, she stamped her foot and told him that\r\nhe had better leave her. "You have high principle," she said, "but\r\nnot principle sufficiently high to understand that this thing could\r\nbe done between you and me without disgrace to either of us." Then\r\nPhineas assured her with tears in his eyes that such an arrangement\r\nwas impossible without disgrace to him.\r\n\r\nBut he whispered to this new friend no word of the engagement with\r\nhis dear Irish Mary. His Irish life, he would tell himself, was a\r\nthing quite apart and separate from his life in England. He said not\r\na word about Mary Flood Jones to any of those with whom he lived\r\nin London. Why should he, feeling as he did that it would so soon\r\nbe necessary that he should disappear from among them? About Miss\r\nEffingham he had said much to Madame Goesler. She had asked him\r\nwhether he had abandoned all hope. "That affair, then, is over?" she\r\nhad said.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--it is all over now."\r\n\r\n"And she will marry the red-headed, violent lord?"\r\n\r\n"Heaven knows. I think she will. But she is exactly the girl to\r\nremain unmarried if she takes it into her head that the man she likes\r\nis in any way unfitted for her."\r\n\r\n"Does she love this lord?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;--there is no doubt of that." And Phineas, as he made this\r\nacknowledgment, seemed to do so without much inward agony of soul.\r\nWhen he had been last in London he could not speak of Violet and Lord\r\nChiltern together without showing that his misery was almost too much\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\nAt this time he received some counsel from two friends. One was\r\nLaurence Fitzgibbon, and the other was Barrington Erle. Laurence had\r\nalways been true to him after a fashion, and had never resented his\r\nintrusion at the Colonial Office. "Phineas, me boy," he said, "if all\r\nthis is thrue, you\'re about up a tree."\r\n\r\n"It is true that I shall support Monk\'s motion."\r\n\r\n"Then, me boy, you\'re up a tree as far as office goes. A place like\r\nthat niver suited me, because, you see, that poker of a young lord\r\nexpected so much of a man; but you don\'t mind that kind of thing, and\r\nI thought you were as snug as snug."\r\n\r\n"Troubles will come, you see, Laurence."\r\n\r\n"Bedad, yes. It\'s all throubles, I think, sometimes. But you\'ve a way\r\nout of all your throubles."\r\n\r\n"What way?"\r\n\r\n"Pop the question to Madame Max. The money\'s all thrue, you know."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t doubt the money in the least," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"And it\'s my belief she\'ll take you without a second word. Anyways,\r\nthry it, Phinny, my boy. That\'s my advice." Phineas so far agreed\r\nwith his friend Laurence that he thought it possible that Madame\r\nGoesler might accept him were he to propose marriage to her. He knew,\r\nof course, that that mode of escape from his difficulties was out\r\nof the question for him, but he could not explain this to Laurence\r\nFitzgibbon.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry to hear that you have taken up a bad cause," said\r\nBarrington Erle to him.\r\n\r\n"It is a pity;--is it not?"\r\n\r\n"And the worst of it is that you\'ll sacrifice yourself and do no good\r\nto the cause. I never knew a man break away in this fashion, and not\r\nfeel afterwards that he had done it all for nothing."\r\n\r\n"But what is a man to do, Barrington? He can\'t smother his\r\nconvictions."\r\n\r\n"Convictions! There is nothing on earth that I\'m so much afraid of in\r\na young member of Parliament as convictions. There are ever so many\r\nrocks against which men get broken. One man can\'t keep his temper.\r\nAnother can\'t hold his tongue. A third can\'t say a word unless he has\r\nbeen priming himself half a session. A fourth is always thinking of\r\nhimself, and wanting more than he can get. A fifth is idle, and won\'t\r\nbe there when he\'s wanted. A sixth is always in the way. A seventh\r\nlies so that you never can trust him. I\'ve had to do with them all,\r\nbut a fellow with convictions is the worst of all."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see how a fellow is to help himself," said Phineas. "When a\r\nfellow begins to meddle with politics they will come."\r\n\r\n"Why can\'t you grow into them gradually as your betters and elders\r\nhave done before you? It ought to be enough for any man, when he\r\nbegins, to know that he\'s a Liberal. He understands which side of the\r\nHouse he\'s to vote, and who is to lead him. What\'s the meaning of\r\nhaving a leader to a party, if it\'s not that? Do you think that you\r\nand Mr. Monk can go and make a government between you?"\r\n\r\n"Whatever I think, I\'m sure he doesn\'t."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not so sure of that. But look here, Phineas, I don\'t care two\r\nstraws about Monk\'s going. I always thought that Mildmay and the\r\nDuke were wrong when they asked him to join. I knew he\'d go over the\r\ntraces,--unless, indeed, he took his money and did nothing for it,\r\nwhich is the way with some of those Radicals. I look upon him as\r\ngone."\r\n\r\n"He has gone."\r\n\r\n"The devil go along with him, as you say in Ireland. But don\'t you be\r\nsuch a fool as to ruin yourself for a crotchet of Monk\'s. It isn\'t\r\ntoo late yet for you to hold back. To tell you the truth, Gresham\r\nhas said a word to me about it already. He is most anxious that you\r\nshould stay, but of course you can\'t stay and vote against us."\r\n\r\n"Of course I cannot."\r\n\r\n"I look upon you, you know, as in some sort my own child. I\'ve tried\r\nto bring other fellows forward who seemed to have something in them,\r\nbut I have never succeeded as I have with you. You\'ve hit the thing\r\noff, and have got the ball at your foot. Upon my honour, in the whole\r\ncourse of my experience I have never known such good fortune as\r\nyours."\r\n\r\n"And I shall always remember how it began, Barrington," said Phineas,\r\nwho was greatly moved by the energy and solicitude of his friend.\r\n\r\n"But, for God\'s sake, don\'t go and destroy it all by such mad\r\nperversity as this. They mean to do something next session. Morrison\r\nis going to take it up." Sir Walter Morrison was at this time\r\nSecretary for Ireland. "But of course we can\'t let a fellow like Monk\r\ntake the matter into his own hands just when he pleases. I call it\r\nd----d treachery."\r\n\r\n"Monk is no traitor, Barrington."\r\n\r\n"Men will have their own opinions about that. It\'s generally\r\nunderstood that when a man is asked to take a seat in the Cabinet he\r\nis expected to conform with his colleagues, unless something very\r\nspecial turns up. But I am speaking of you now, and not of Monk. You\r\nare not a man of fortune. You cannot afford to make ducks and drakes.\r\nYou are excellently placed, and you have plenty of time to hark back,\r\nif you\'ll only listen to reason. All that Irish stump balderdash will\r\nnever be thrown in your teeth by us, if you will just go on as though\r\nit had never been uttered."\r\n\r\nPhineas could only thank his friend for his advice, which was at\r\nleast disinterested, and was good of its kind, and tell him that he\r\nwould think of it. He did think of it very much. He almost thought\r\nthat, were it to do again, he would allow Mr. Monk to go upon his\r\ntour alone, and keep himself from the utterance of anything that so\r\ngood a judge as Erle could call stump balderdash. As he sat in his\r\narm-chair in his room at the Colonial Office, with despatch-boxes\r\naround him, and official papers spread before him,--feeling himself\r\nto be one of those who in truth managed and governed the affairs of\r\nthis great nation, feeling also that if he relinquished his post now\r\nhe could never regain it,--he did wish that he had been a little less\r\nin love with independence, a little quieter in his boastings that no\r\nofficial considerations should ever silence his tongue. But all this\r\nwas too late now. He knew that his skin was not thick enough to bear\r\nthe arrows of those archers who would bend their bows against him if\r\nhe should now dare to vote against Mr. Monk\'s motion. His own party\r\nmight be willing to forgive and forget; but there would be others who\r\nwould read those reports, and would appear in the House with the\r\nodious tell-tale newspapers in their hands.\r\n\r\nThen he received a letter from his father. Some good-natured person\r\nhad enlightened the doctor as to the danger in which his son\r\nwas placing himself. Dr. Finn, who in his own profession was a\r\nvery excellent and well-instructed man, had been so ignorant of\r\nParliamentary tactics, as to have been proud at his son\'s success at\r\nthe Irish meetings. He had thought that Phineas was carrying on his\r\ntrade as a public speaker with proper energy and continued success.\r\nHe had cared nothing himself for tenant-right, and had acknowledged\r\nto Mr. Monk that he could not understand in what it was that the\r\nfarmers were wronged. But he knew that Mr. Monk was a Cabinet\r\nMinister, and he thought that Phineas was earning his salary. Then\r\nthere came some one who undeceived him, and the paternal bosom of\r\nthe doctor was dismayed. "I don\'t mean to interfere," he said in his\r\nletter, "but I can hardly believe that you really intend to resign\r\nyour place. Yet I am told that you must do so if you go on with this\r\nmatter. My dear boy, pray think about it. I cannot imagine you are\r\ndisposed to lose all that you have won for nothing." Mary also wrote\r\nto him. Mrs. Finn had been talking to her, and Mary had taught\r\nherself to believe that after the many sweet conversations she\r\nhad had with a man so high in office as Phineas, she really did\r\nunderstand something about the British Government. Mrs. Finn had\r\ninterrogated Mary, and Mary had been obliged to own that it was quite\r\npossible that Phineas would be called upon to resign.\r\n\r\n"But why, my dear? Heaven and earth! Resign two thousand a year!"\r\n\r\n"That he may maintain his independence," said Mary proudly.\r\n\r\n"Fiddlestick!" said Mrs. Finn. "How is he to maintain you, or himself\r\neither, if he goes on in that way? I shouldn\'t wonder if he didn\'t\r\nget himself all wrong, even now." Then Mrs. Finn began to cry; and\r\nMary could only write to her lover, pointing out to him how very\r\nanxious all his friends were that he should do nothing in a hurry.\r\nBut what if the thing were done already! Phineas in his great\r\ndiscomfort went to seek further counsel from Madame Goesler. Of all\r\nhis counsellors, Madame Goesler was the only one who applauded him\r\nfor what he was about to do.\r\n\r\n"But, after all, what is it you give up? Mr. Gresham may be out\r\nto-morrow, and then where will be your place?"\r\n\r\n"There does not seem to be much chance of that at present."\r\n\r\n"Who can tell? Of course I do not understand,--but it was only the\r\nother day when Mr. Mildmay was there, and only the day before that\r\nwhen Lord de Terrier was there, and again only the day before\r\nthat when Lord Brock was there." Phineas endeavoured to make her\r\nunderstand that of the four Prime Ministers whom she had named, three\r\nwere men of the same party as himself, under whom it would have\r\nsuited him to serve. "I would not serve under any man if I were an\r\nEnglish gentleman in Parliament," said Madame Goesler.\r\n\r\n"What is a poor fellow to do?" said Phineas, laughing.\r\n\r\n"A poor fellow need not be a poor fellow unless he likes," said\r\nMadame Goesler. Immediately after this Phineas left her, and as he\r\nwent along the street he began to question himself whether the\r\nprospects of his own darling Mary were at all endangered by his\r\nvisits to Park Lane; and to reflect what sort of a blackguard he\r\nwould be,--a blackguard of how deep a dye,--were he to desert Mary\r\nand marry Madame Max Goesler. Then he also asked himself as to the\r\nnature and quality of his own political honesty if he were to abandon\r\nMary in order that he might maintain his parliamentary independence.\r\nAfter all, if it should ever come to pass that his biography should\r\nbe written, his biographer would say very much more about the manner\r\nin which he kept his seat in Parliament than of the manner in which\r\nhe kept his engagement with Miss Mary Flood Jones. Half a dozen\r\npeople who knew him and her might think ill of him for his conduct\r\nto Mary, but the world would not condemn him! And when he thundered\r\nforth his liberal eloquence from below the gangway as an independent\r\nmember, having the fortune of his charming wife to back him, giving\r\nexcellent dinners at the same time in Park Lane, would not the world\r\npraise him very loudly?\r\n\r\nWhen he got to his office he found a note from Lord Brentford\r\ninviting him to dine in Portman Square.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII\r\n\r\nThe Joint Attack\r\n\r\n\r\nThe note from Lord Brentford surprised our hero not a little. He had\r\nhad no communication with the Earl since the day on which he had been\r\nso savagely scolded about the duel, when the Earl had plainly told\r\nhim that his conduct had been as bad as it could be. Phineas had not\r\non that account become at all ashamed of his conduct in reference to\r\nthe duel, but he had conceived that any reconciliation between him\r\nand the Earl had been out of the question. Now there had come a\r\ncivilly-worded invitation, asking him to dine with the offended\r\nnobleman. The note had been written by Lady Laura, but it had\r\npurported to come from Lord Brentford himself. He sent back word to\r\nsay that he should be happy to have the honour of dining with Lord\r\nBrentford.\r\n\r\nParliament at this time had been sitting nearly a month, and it was\r\nalready March. Phineas had heard nothing of Lady Laura, and did not\r\neven know that she was in London till he saw her handwriting. He did\r\nnot know that she had not gone back to her husband, and that she had\r\nremained with her father all the winter at Saulsby. He had also\r\nheard that Lord Chiltern had been at Saulsby. All the world had been\r\ntalking of the separation of Mr. Kennedy from his wife, one half of\r\nthe world declaring that his wife, if not absolutely false to him,\r\nhad neglected all her duties; and the other half asserting that Mr.\r\nKennedy\'s treatment of his wife had been so bad that no woman could\r\npossibly have lived with him. There had even been a rumour that Lady\r\nLaura had gone off with a lover from the Duke of Omnium\'s garden\r\nparty, and some indiscreet tongue had hinted that a certain unmarried\r\nUnder-Secretary of State was missing at the same time. But Lord\r\nChiltern upon this had shown his teeth with so strong a propensity to\r\ndo some real biting, that no one had ventured to repeat that rumour.\r\nIts untruth was soon established by the fact that Lady Laura Kennedy\r\nwas living with her father at Saulsby. Of Mr. Kennedy, Phineas had as\r\nyet seen nothing since he had been up in town. That gentleman, though\r\na member of the Cabinet, had not been in London at the opening of the\r\nsession, nor had he attended the Cabinet meetings during the recess.\r\nIt had been stated in the newspapers that he was ill, and stated in\r\nprivate that he could not bear to show himself since his wife had\r\nleft him. At last, however, he came to London, and Phineas saw him in\r\nthe House. Then, when the first meeting of the Cabinet was summoned\r\nafter his return, it became known that he also had resigned his\r\noffice. There was nothing said about his resignation in the House. He\r\nhad resigned on the score of ill-health, and that very worthy peer,\r\nLord Mount Thistle, formerly Sir Marmaduke Morecombe, came back to\r\nthe Duchy of Lancaster in his place. A Prime Minister sometimes finds\r\ngreat relief in the possession of a serviceable stick who can be made\r\nto go in and out as occasion may require; only it generally happens\r\nthat the stick will expect some reward when he is made to go out.\r\nLord Mount Thistle immediately saw his way to a viscount\'s coronet,\r\nwhen he was once more summoned to the august councils of the\r\nMinisters.\r\n\r\nA few days after this had been arranged, in the interval between\r\nLord Brentford\'s invitation and Lord Brentford\'s dinner, Phineas\r\nencountered Mr. Kennedy so closely in one of the passages of the\r\nHouse that it was impossible that they should not speak to each\r\nother, unless they were to avoid each other as people do who have\r\npalpably quarrelled. Phineas saw that Mr. Kennedy was hesitating, and\r\ntherefore took the bull by the horns. He greeted his former friend\r\nin a friendly fashion, shaking him by the hand, and then prepared\r\nto pass on. But Mr. Kennedy, though he had hesitated at first, now\r\ndetained his brother member. "Finn," he said, "if you are not engaged\r\nI should like to speak to you for a moment." Phineas was not engaged,\r\nand allowed himself to be led out arm-in-arm by the late Chancellor\r\nof the Duchy into Westminster Hall. "Of course you know what a\r\nterrible thing has happened to me," said Mr. Kennedy.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I have heard of it," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Everybody has heard of it. That is one of the terrible cruelties of\r\nsuch a blow."\r\n\r\n"All those things are very bad of course. I was very much\r\ngrieved,--because you have both been intimate friends of mine."\r\n\r\n"Yes,--yes; we were. Do you ever see her now?"\r\n\r\n"Not since last July,--at the Duke\'s party, you know."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes; the morning of that day was the last on which I spoke to\r\nher. It was then she left me."\r\n\r\n"I am going to dine with Lord Brentford to-morrow, and I dare say she\r\nwill be there."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--she is in town. I saw her yesterday in her father\'s carriage.\r\nI think that she had no cause to leave me."\r\n\r\n"Of course I cannot say anything about that."\r\n\r\n"I think she had no cause to leave me." Phineas as he heard this\r\ncould not but remember all that Lady Laura had told himself, and\r\nthought that no woman had ever had a better reason for leaving her\r\nhusband. "There were things I did not like, and I said so."\r\n\r\n"I suppose that is generally the way," replied Phineas.\r\n\r\n"But surely a wife should listen to a word of caution from her\r\nhusband."\r\n\r\n"I fancy they never like it," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"But are we all of us to have all that we like? I have not found it\r\nso. Or would it be good for us if we had?" Then he paused; but as\r\nPhineas had no further remark to make, he continued speaking after\r\nthey had walked about a third of the length of the hall. "It is not\r\nof my own comfort I am thinking now so much as of her name and her\r\nfuture conduct. Of course it will in every sense be best for her that\r\nshe should come back to her husband\'s roof."\r\n\r\n"Well; yes;--perhaps it would," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Has she not accepted that lot for better or for worse?" said Mr.\r\nKennedy, solemnly.\r\n\r\n"But incompatibility of temper, you know, is always,--always\r\nsupposed--. You understand me?"\r\n\r\n"It is my intention that she should come back to me. I do not wish to\r\nmake any legal demand;--at any rate, not as yet. Will you consent to\r\nbe the bearer of a message from me both to herself and to the Earl?"\r\n\r\nNow it seemed to Phineas that of all the messengers whom Mr. Kennedy\r\ncould have chosen he was the most unsuited to be a Mercury in this\r\ncause,--not perceiving that he had been so selected with some craft,\r\nin order that Lady Laura might understand that the accusation against\r\nher was, at any rate, withdrawn, which had named Phineas as her\r\nlover. He paused again before he answered. "Of course," he said, "I\r\nshould be most willing to be of service, if it were possible. But I\r\ndo not see how I can speak to the Earl about it. Though I am going to\r\ndine with him I don\'t know why he has asked me;--for he and I are on\r\nvery bad terms. He heard that stupid story about the duel, and has\r\nnot spoken to me since."\r\n\r\n"I heard that, too," said Mr. Kennedy, frowning blackly as he\r\nremembered his wife\'s duplicity.\r\n\r\n"Everybody heard of it. But it has made such a difference between him\r\nand me, that I don\'t think I can meddle. Send for Lord Chiltern, and\r\nspeak to him."\r\n\r\n"Speak to Chiltern! Never! He would probably strike me on the head\r\nwith his club."\r\n\r\n"Call on the Earl yourself."\r\n\r\n"I did, and he would not see me."\r\n\r\n"Write to him."\r\n\r\n"I did, and he sent back my letter unopened."\r\n\r\n"Write to her."\r\n\r\n"I did;--and she answered me, saying only thus; \'Indeed, indeed, it\r\ncannot be so.\' But it must be so. The laws of God require it, and the\r\nlaws of man permit it. I want some one to point out that to them more\r\nsoftly than I could do if I were simply to write to that effect. To\r\nthe Earl, of course, I cannot write again." The conference ended by a\r\npromise from Phineas that he would, if possible, say a word to Lady\r\nLaura.\r\n\r\nWhen he was shown into Lord Brentford\'s drawing-room he found not\r\nonly Lady Laura there, but her brother. Lord Brentford was not in\r\nthe room. Barrington Erle was there, and so also were Lord and Lady\r\nCantrip.\r\n\r\n"Is not your father going to be here?" he said to Lady Laura, after\r\ntheir first greeting.\r\n\r\n"We live in that hope," said she, "and do not at all know why he\r\nshould be late. What has become of him, Oswald?"\r\n\r\n"He came in with me half an hour ago, and I suppose he does not\r\ndress as quickly as I do," said Lord Chiltern; upon which Phineas\r\nimmediately understood that the father and the son were reconciled,\r\nand he rushed to the conclusion that Violet and her lover would also\r\nsoon be reconciled, if such were not already the case. He felt some\r\nremnant of a soreness that it should be so, as a man feels where\r\nhis headache has been when the real ache itself has left him. Then\r\nthe host came in and made his apologies. "Chiltern kept me standing\r\nabout," he said, "till the east wind had chilled me through and\r\nthrough. The only charm I recognise in youth is that it is impervious\r\nto the east wind." Phineas felt quite sure now that Violet and her\r\nlover were reconciled, and he had a distinct feeling of the place\r\nwhere the ache had been. Dear Violet! But, after all, Violet lacked\r\nthat sweet, clinging, feminine softness which made Mary Flood Jones\r\nso pre-eminently the most charming of her sex. The Earl, when he had\r\nrepeated his general apology, especially to Lady Cantrip, who was the\r\nonly lady present except his daughter, came up to our hero and shook\r\nhim kindly by the hand. He took him up to one of the windows and then\r\naddressed him in a voice of mock solemnity.\r\n\r\n"Stick to the colonies, young man," he said, "and never meddle with\r\nforeign affairs;--especially not at Blankenberg."\r\n\r\n"Never again, my Lord;--never again."\r\n\r\n"And leave all questions of fire-arms to be arranged between the\r\nHorse Guards and the War Office. I have heard a good deal about it\r\nsince I saw you, and I retract a part of what I said. But a duel is a\r\nfoolish thing,--a very foolish thing. Come;--here is dinner." And the\r\nEarl walked off with Lady Cantrip, and Lord Cantrip walked off with\r\nLady Laura. Barrington Erle followed, and Phineas had an opportunity\r\nof saying a word to his friend, Lord Chiltern, as they went down\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right between you and your father?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--after a fashion. There is no knowing how long it will last. He\r\nwants me to do three things, and I won\'t do any one of them."\r\n\r\n"What are the three?"\r\n\r\n"To go into Parliament, to be an owner of sheep and oxen, and to hunt\r\nin his own county. I should never attend the first, I should ruin\r\nmyself with the second, and I should never get a run in the third."\r\nBut there was not a word said about his marriage.\r\n\r\nThere were only seven who sat down to dinner, and the six were all\r\npeople with whom Phineas was or had been on most intimate terms.\r\nLord Cantrip was his official chief, and, since that connection had\r\nexisted between them, Lady Cantrip had been very gracious to him.\r\nShe quite understood the comfort which it was to her husband to have\r\nunder him, as his representative in the House of Commons, a man whom\r\nhe could thoroughly trust and like, and therefore she had used her\r\nwoman\'s arts to bind Phineas to her lord in more than mere official\r\nbondage. She had tried her skill also upon Laurence Fitzgibbon,--but\r\naltogether in vain. He had eaten her dinners and accepted her\r\ncourtesies, and had given for them no return whatever. But Phineas\r\nhad possessed a more grateful mind, and had done all that had been\r\nrequired of him;--had done all that had been required of him till\r\nthere had come that terrible absurdity in Ireland. "I knew very well\r\nwhat sort of things would happen when they brought such a man as Mr.\r\nMonk into the Cabinet," Lady Cantrip had said to her husband.\r\n\r\nBut though the party was very small, and though the guests were all\r\nhis intimate friends, Phineas suspected nothing special till an\r\nattack was made upon him as soon as the servants had left the room.\r\nThis was done in the presence of the two ladies, and, no doubt, had\r\nbeen preconcerted. There was Lord Cantrip there, who had already said\r\nmuch to him, and Barrington Erle who had said more even than Lord\r\nCantrip. Lord Brentford, himself a member of the Cabinet, opened the\r\nattack by asking whether it was actually true that Mr. Monk meant\r\nto go on with his motion. Barrington Erle asserted that Mr. Monk\r\npositively would do so. "And Gresham will oppose it?" asked the Earl.\r\n"Of course he will," said Barrington. "Of course he will," said Lord\r\nCantrip. "I know what I should think of him if he did not," said Lady\r\nCantrip. "He is the last man in the world to be forced into a thing,"\r\nsaid Lady Laura. Then Phineas knew pretty well what was coming on\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nLord Brentford began again by asking how many supporters Mr. Monk\r\nwould have in the House. "That depends upon the amount of courage\r\nwhich the Conservatives may have," said Barrington Erle. "If they\r\ndare to vote for a thoroughly democratic measure, simply for the sake\r\nof turning us out, it is quite on the cards that they may succeed."\r\n"But of our own people?" asked Lord Cantrip. "You had better inquire\r\nthat of Phineas Finn," said Barrington. And then the attack was made.\r\n\r\nOur hero had a bad half hour of it, though many words were said which\r\nmust have gratified him much. They all wanted to keep him,--so Lord\r\nCantrip declared, "except one or two whom I could name, and who are\r\nparticularly anxious to wear his shoes," said Barrington, thinking\r\nthat certain reminiscences of Phineas with regard to Mr. Bonteen\r\nand others might operate as strongly as any other consideration to\r\nmake him love his place. Lord Brentford declared that he could not\r\nunderstand it,--that he should find himself lost in amazement if such\r\na man as his young friend allowed himself to be led into the outer\r\nwilderness by such an ignis-fatuus of light as this. Lord Cantrip\r\nlaid down the unwritten traditional law of Government officials very\r\nplainly. A man in office,--in an office which really imposed upon\r\nhim as much work as he could possibly do with credit to himself or\r\nhis cause,--was dispensed from the necessity of a conscience with\r\nreference to other matters. It was for Sir Walter Morrison to have\r\na conscience about Irish tenant-right, as no doubt he had,--just as\r\nPhineas Finn had a conscience about Canada, and Jamaica, and the\r\nCape. Barrington Erle was very strong about parties in general, and\r\npainted the comforts of official position in glowing colours. But I\r\nthink that the two ladies were more efficacious than even their male\r\nrelatives in the arguments which they used. "We have been so happy\r\nto have you among us," said Lady Cantrip, looking at him with\r\nbeseeching, almost loving eyes. "Mr. Finn knows," said Lady Laura,\r\n"that since he first came into Parliament I have always believed\r\nin his success, and I have been very proud to see it." "We shall\r\nweep over him, as over a fallen angel, if he leaves us," said Lady\r\nCantrip. "I won\'t say that I will weep," said Lady Laura, "but I do\r\nnot know anything of the kind that would so truly make me unhappy."\r\n\r\nWhat was he to say in answer to applications so flattering and so\r\npressing? He would have said nothing, had that been possible, but he\r\nfelt himself obliged to reply. He replied very weakly,--of course,\r\nnot justifying himself, but declaring that as he had gone so far he\r\nmust go further. He must vote for the measure now. Both his chief and\r\nBarrington Erle proved, or attempted to prove, that he was wrong in\r\nthis. Of course he would not speak on the measure, and his vote for\r\nhis party would probably be allowed to pass without notice. One or\r\ntwo newspapers might perhaps attack him; but what public man cared\r\nfor such attacks as those? His whole party would hang by him, and in\r\nthat he would find ample consolation. Phineas could only say that he\r\nwould think of it;--and this he said in so irresolute a tone of voice\r\nthat all the men then present believed that he was gained. The two\r\nladies, however, were of a different opinion. "In spite of anything\r\nthat anybody may say, he will do what he thinks right when the time\r\ncomes," said Laura to her father afterwards. But then Lady Laura had\r\nbeen in love with him,--was perhaps almost in love with him still.\r\n"I\'m afraid he is a mule," said Lady Cantrip to her husband. "He\'s\r\na good mule up a hill with a load on his back," said his lordship.\r\n"But with a mule there always comes a time when you can\'t manage\r\nhim," said Lady Cantrip. But Lady Cantrip had never been in love with\r\nPhineas.\r\n\r\nPhineas found a moment, before he left Lord Brentford\'s house, to say\r\na word to Lady Laura as to the commission that had been given to him.\r\n"It can never be," said Lady Laura, shuddering;--"never, never,\r\nnever!"\r\n\r\n"You are not angry with me for speaking?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no--not if he told you."\r\n\r\n"He made me promise that I would."\r\n\r\n"Tell him it cannot be. Tell him that if he has any instruction to\r\nsend me as to what he considers to be my duty, I will endeavour to\r\ncomply, if that duty can be done apart. I will recognize him so\r\nfar, because of my vow. But not even for the sake of my vow, will I\r\nendeavour to live with him. His presence would kill me!"\r\n\r\nWhen Phineas repeated this, or as much of this as he judged to be\r\nnecessary, to Mr. Kennedy a day or two afterwards, that gentleman\r\nreplied that in such case he would have no alternative but to seek\r\nredress at law. "I have done nothing to my wife," said he, "of\r\nwhich I need be ashamed. It will be sad, no doubt, to have all our\r\naffairs bandied about in court, and made the subject of comment in\r\nnewspapers, but a man must go through that, or worse than that, in\r\nthe vindication of his rights, and for the performance of his duty to\r\nhis Maker." That very day Mr. Kennedy went to his lawyer, and desired\r\nthat steps might be taken for the restitution to him of his conjugal\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX\r\n\r\nThe Temptress\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Monk\'s bill was read the first time before Easter, and Phineas\r\nFinn still held his office. He had spoken to the Prime Minister\r\nonce on the subject, and had been surprised at that gentleman\'s\r\ncourtesy;--for Mr. Gresham had the reputation of being unconciliatory\r\nin his manners, and very prone to resent anything like desertion from\r\nthat allegiance which was due to himself as the leader of his party.\r\n"You had better stay where you are and take no step that may be\r\nirretrievable, till you have quite made up your mind," said Mr.\r\nGresham.\r\n\r\n"I fear I have made up my mind," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Nothing can be done till after Easter," replied the great man, "and\r\nthere is no knowing how things may go then. I strongly recommend you\r\nto stay with us. If you can do this it will be only necessary that\r\nyou shall put your resignation in Lord Cantrip\'s hands before you\r\nspeak or vote against us. See Monk and talk it over with him." Mr.\r\nGresham possibly imagined that Mr. Monk might be moved to abandon his\r\nbill, when he saw what injury he was about to do.\r\n\r\nAt this time Phineas received the following letter from his darling\r\nMary:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Floodborough, Thursday.\r\n\r\n   DEAREST PHINEAS,\r\n\r\n   We have just got home from Killaloe, and mean to remain\r\n   here all through the summer. After leaving your sisters\r\n   this house seems so desolate; but I shall have the more\r\n   time to think of you. I have been reading Tennyson, as you\r\n   told me, and I fancy that I could in truth be a Mariana\r\n   here, if it were not that I am so quite certain that you\r\n   will come;--and that makes all the difference in the world\r\n   in a moated grange. Last night I sat at the window and\r\n   tried to realise what I should feel if you were to tell me\r\n   that you did not want me; and I got myself into such an\r\n   ecstatic state of mock melancholy that I cried for half an\r\n   hour. But when one has such a real living joy at the back\r\n   of one\'s romantic melancholy, tears are very pleasant;--\r\n   they water and do not burn.\r\n\r\n   I must tell you about them all at Killaloe. They certainly\r\n   are very unhappy at the idea of your resigning. Your\r\n   father says very little, but I made him own that to act\r\n   as you are acting for the sake of principle is very grand.\r\n   I would not leave him till he had said so, and he did say\r\n   it. Dear Mrs. Finn does not understand it as well, but\r\n   she will do so. She complains mostly for my sake, and\r\n   when I tell her that I will wait twenty years if it is\r\n   necessary, she tells me I do not know what waiting means.\r\n   But I will,--and will be happy, and will never really\r\n   think myself a Mariana. Dear, dear, dear Phineas, indeed\r\n   I won\'t. The girls are half sad and half proud. But I am\r\n   wholly proud, and know that you are doing just what you\r\n   ought to do. I shall think more of you as a man who might\r\n   have been a Prime Minister than if you were really sitting\r\n   in the Cabinet like Lord Cantrip. As for mamma, I cannot\r\n   make her quite understand it. She merely says that no\r\n   young man who is going to be married ought to resign\r\n   anything. Dear mamma;--sometimes she does say such odd\r\n   things.\r\n\r\n   You told me to tell you everything, and so I have. I\r\n   talk to some of the people here, and tell them what they\r\n   might do if they had tenant-right. One old fellow, Mike\r\n   Dufferty,--I don\'t know whether you remember him,--asked\r\n   if he would have to pay the rent all the same. When I said\r\n   certainly he would, then he shook his head. But as you\r\n   said once, when we want to do good to people one has no\r\n   right to expect that they should understand it. It is like\r\n   baptizing little infants.\r\n\r\n   I got both your notes;--seven words in one, Mr.\r\n   Under-Secretary, and nine in the other! But the one little\r\n   word at the end was worth a whole sheet full of common\r\n   words. How nice it is to write letters without paying\r\n   postage, and to send them about the world with a grand\r\n   name in the corner. When Barney brings me one he always\r\n   looks as if he didn\'t know whether it was a love letter\r\n   or an order to go to Botany Bay. If he saw the inside of\r\n   them, how short they are, I don\'t think he\'d think much of\r\n   you as a lover nor yet as an Under-Secretary.\r\n\r\n   But I think ever so much of you as both;--I do, indeed;\r\n   and I am not scolding you a bit. As long as I can have two\r\n   or three dear, sweet, loving words, I shall be as happy as\r\n   a queen. Ah, if you knew it all! But you never can know\r\n   it all. A man has so many other things to learn that he\r\n   cannot understand it.\r\n\r\n   Good-bye, dear, dear, dearest man. Whatever you do I shall\r\n   be quite sure you have done the best.\r\n\r\n   Ever your own, with all the love of her heart,\r\n\r\n   MARY F. JONES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was very nice. Such a man as was Phineas Finn always takes a\r\ndelight which he cannot express even to himself in the receipt of\r\nsuch a letter as this. There is nothing so flattering as the warm\r\nexpression of the confidence of a woman\'s love, and Phineas thought\r\nthat no woman ever expressed this more completely than did his Mary.\r\nDear, dearest Mary. As for giving her up, as for treachery to one so\r\ntrusting, so sweet, so well beloved, that was out of the question.\r\nBut nevertheless the truth came home to him more clearly day by day,\r\nthat he of all men was the last who ought to have given himself up to\r\nsuch a passion. For her sake he ought to have abstained. So he told\r\nhimself now. For her sake he ought to have kept aloof from her;--and\r\nfor his own sake he ought to have kept aloof from Mr. Monk. That very\r\nday, with Mary\'s letter in his pocket, he went to the livery stables\r\nand explained that he would not keep his horse any longer. There was\r\nno difficulty about the horse. Mr. Howard Macleod of the Treasury\r\nwould take him from that very hour. Phineas, as he walked away,\r\nuttered a curse upon Mr. Howard Macleod. Mr. Howard Macleod was just\r\nbeginning the glory of his life in London, and he, Phineas Finn, was\r\nbringing his to an end.\r\n\r\nWith Mary\'s letter in his pocket he went up to Portman Square. He had\r\nagain got into the habit of seeing Lady Laura frequently, and was\r\noften with her brother, who now again lived at his father\'s house.\r\nA letter had reached Lord Brentford, through his lawyer, in which a\r\ndemand was made by Mr. Kennedy for the return of his wife. She was\r\nquite determined that she would never go back to him; and there had\r\ncome to her a doubt whether it would not be expedient that she should\r\nlive abroad so as to be out of the way of persecution from her\r\nhusband. Lord Brentford was in great wrath, and Lord Chiltern had\r\nonce or twice hinted that perhaps he had better "see" Mr. Kennedy.\r\nThe amenities of such an interview, as this would be, had up to the\r\npresent day been postponed; and, in a certain way, Phineas had been\r\nused as a messenger between Mr. Kennedy and his wife\'s family.\r\n\r\n"I think it will end," she said, "in my going to Dresden, and\r\nsettling myself there. Papa will come to me when Parliament is not\r\nsitting."\r\n\r\n"It will be very dull."\r\n\r\n"Dull! What does dulness amount to when one has come to such a pass\r\nas this? When one is in the ruck of fortune, to be dull is very bad;\r\nbut when misfortune comes, simple dulness is nothing. It sounds\r\nalmost like relief."\r\n\r\n"It is so hard that you should be driven away." She did not answer\r\nhim for a while, and he was beginning to think of his own case also.\r\nWas it not hard that he too should be driven away? "It is odd enough\r\nthat we should both be going at the same time."\r\n\r\n"But you will not go?"\r\n\r\n"I think I shall. I have resolved upon this,--that if I give up my\r\nplace, I will give up my seat too. I went into Parliament with the\r\nhope of office, and how can I remain there when I shall have gained\r\nit and then have lost it?"\r\n\r\n"But you will stay in London, Mr. Finn?"\r\n\r\n"I think not. After all that has come and gone I should not be happy\r\nhere, and I should make my way easier and on cheaper terms in Dublin.\r\nMy present idea is that I shall endeavour to make a practice over in\r\nmy own country. It will be hard work beginning at the bottom;--will\r\nit not?"\r\n\r\n"And so unnecessary."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Lady Laura,--if it only could be avoided! But it is of no use\r\ngoing through all that again."\r\n\r\n"How much we would both of us avoid if we could only have another\r\nchance!" said Lady Laura. "If I could only be as I was before I\r\npersuaded myself to marry a man whom I never loved, what a paradise\r\nthe earth would be to me! With me all regrets are too late."\r\n\r\n"And with me as much so."\r\n\r\n"No, Mr. Finn. Even should you resign your office, there is no reason\r\nwhy you should give up your seat."\r\n\r\n"Simply that I have no income to maintain me in London."\r\n\r\nShe was silent for a few moments, during which she changed her seat\r\nso as to come nearer to him, placing herself on a corner of a sofa\r\nclose to the chair on which he was seated. "I wonder whether I may\r\nspeak to you plainly," she said.\r\n\r\n"Indeed you may."\r\n\r\n"On any subject?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--on any subject."\r\n\r\n"I trust you have been able to rid your bosom of all remembrances of\r\nViolet Effingham."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not of all remembrances, Lady Laura."\r\n\r\n"Of all hope, then?"\r\n\r\n"I have no such hope."\r\n\r\n"And of all lingering desires?"\r\n\r\n"Well, yes;--and of all lingering desires. I know now that it cannot\r\nbe. Your brother is welcome to her."\r\n\r\n"Ah;--of that I know nothing. He, with his perversity, has estranged\r\nher. But I am sure of this,--that if she do not marry him, she will\r\nmarry no one. But it is not on account of him that I speak. He must\r\nfight his own battles now."\r\n\r\n"I shall not interfere with him, Lady Laura."\r\n\r\n"Then why should you not establish yourself by a marriage that will\r\nmake place a matter of indifference to you? I know that it is within\r\nyour power to do so." Phineas put his hand up to his breastcoat\r\npocket, and felt that Mary\'s letter,--her precious letter,--was there\r\nsafe. It certainly was not in his power to do this thing which Lady\r\nLaura recommended to him, but he hardly thought that the present was\r\na moment suitable for explaining to her the nature of the impediment\r\nwhich stood in the way of such an arrangement. He had so lately\r\nspoken to Lady Laura with an assurance of undying constancy of his\r\nlove for Miss Effingham, that he could not as yet acknowledge the\r\nforce of another passion. He shook his head by way of reply. "I tell\r\nyou that it is so," she said with energy.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid not."\r\n\r\n"Go to Madame Goesler, and ask her. Hear what she will say."\r\n\r\n"Madame Goesler would laugh at me, no doubt."\r\n\r\n"Psha! You do not think so. You know that she would not laugh. And\r\nare you the man to be afraid of a woman\'s laughter? I think not."\r\n\r\nAgain he did not answer her at once, and when he did speak the tone\r\nof his voice was altered. "What was it you said of yourself, just\r\nnow?"\r\n\r\n"What did I say of myself?"\r\n\r\n"You regretted that you had consented to marry a man,--whom you did\r\nnot love."\r\n\r\n"Why should you not love her? And it is so different with a man! A\r\nwoman is wretched if she does not love her husband, but I fancy that\r\na man gets on very well without any such feeling. She cannot domineer\r\nover you. She cannot expect you to pluck yourself out of your own\r\nsoil, and begin a new growth altogether in accordance with the laws\r\nof her own. It was that which Mr. Kennedy did."\r\n\r\n"I do not for a moment think that she would take me, if I were to\r\noffer myself."\r\n\r\n"Try her," said Lady Laura energetically. "Such trials cost you but\r\nlittle;--we both of us know that!" Still he said nothing of the\r\nletter in his pocket. "It is everything that you should go on now\r\nthat you have once begun. I do not believe in you working at the\r\nBar. You cannot do it. A man who has commenced life as you have done\r\nwith the excitement of politics, who has known what it is to take a\r\nprominent part in the control of public affairs, cannot give it up\r\nand be happy at other work. Make her your wife, and you may resign\r\nor remain in office just as you choose. Office will be much easier\r\nto you than it is now, because it will not be a necessity. Let me\r\nat any rate have the pleasure of thinking that one of us can remain\r\nhere,--that we need not both fall together."\r\n\r\nStill he did not tell her of the letter in his pocket. He felt that\r\nshe moved him,--that she made him acknowledge to himself how great\r\nwould be the pity of such a failure as would be his. He was quite as\r\nmuch alive as she could be to the fact that work at the Bar, either\r\nin London or in Dublin, would have no charms for him now. The\r\nprospect of such a life was very dreary to him. Even with the comfort\r\nof Mary\'s love such a life would be very dreary to him. And then he\r\nknew,--he thought that he knew,--that were he to offer himself to\r\nMadame Goesler he would not in truth be rejected. She had told him\r\nthat if poverty was a trouble to him he need be no longer poor. Of\r\ncourse he had understood this. Her money was at his service if he\r\nshould choose to stoop and pick it up. And it was not only money that\r\nsuch a marriage would give him. He had acknowledged to himself more\r\nthan once that Madame Goesler was very lovely, that she was clever,\r\nattractive in every way, and as far as he could see, blessed with a\r\nsweet temper. She had a position, too, in the world that would help\r\nhim rather than mar him. What might he not do with an independent\r\nseat in the House of Commons, and as joint owner of the little house\r\nin Park Lane? Of all careers which the world could offer to a man the\r\npleasantest would then be within his reach. "You appear to me as a\r\ntempter," he said at last to Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"It is unkind of you to say that, and ungrateful. I would do anything\r\non earth in my power to help you."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless you are a tempter."\r\n\r\n"I know how it ought to have been," she said, in a low voice. "I know\r\nvery well how it ought to have been. I should have kept myself free\r\ntill that time when we met on the braes of Loughlinter, and then all\r\nwould have been well with us."\r\n\r\n"I do not know how that might have been," said Phineas, hoarsely.\r\n\r\n"You do not know! But I know. Of course you have stabbed me with a\r\nthousand daggers when you have told me from time to time of your love\r\nfor Violet. You have been very cruel,--needlessly cruel. Men are so\r\ncruel! But for all that I have known that I could have kept you,--had\r\nit not been too late when you spoke to me. Will you not own as much\r\nas that?"\r\n\r\n"Of course you would have been everything to me. I should never have\r\nthought of Violet then."\r\n\r\n"That is the only kind word you have said to me from that day to\r\nthis. I try to comfort myself in thinking that it would have been so.\r\nBut all that is past and gone, and done. I have had my romance and\r\nyou have had yours. As you are a man, it is natural that you should\r\nhave been disturbed by a double image;--it is not so with me."\r\n\r\n"And yet you can advise me to offer marriage to a woman,--a woman\r\nwhom I am to seek merely because she is rich?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I do so advise you. You have had your romance and must now\r\nput up with reality. Why should I so advise you but for the interest\r\nthat I have in you? Your prosperity will do me no good. I shall not\r\neven be here to see it. I shall hear of it only as so many a woman\r\nbanished out of England hears a distant misunderstood report of what\r\nis going on in the country she has left. But I still have regard\r\nenough,--I will be bold, and, knowing that you will not take it\r\namiss, will say love enough for you,--to feel a desire that you\r\nshould not be shipwrecked. Since we first took you in hand between\r\nus, Barrington and I, I have never swerved in my anxiety on your\r\nbehalf. When I resolved that it would be better for us both that we\r\nshould be only friends, I did not swerve. When you would talk to me\r\nso cruelly of your love for Violet, I did not swerve. When I warned\r\nyou from Loughlinter because I thought there was danger, I did not\r\nswerve. When I bade you not to come to me in London because of my\r\nhusband, I did not swerve. When my father was hard upon you, I\r\ndid not swerve then. I would not leave him till he was softened.\r\nWhen you tried to rob Oswald of his love, and I thought you would\r\nsucceed,--for I did think so,--I did not swerve. I have ever been\r\ntrue to you. And now that I must hide myself and go away, and be seen\r\nno more, I am true still."\r\n\r\n"Laura,--dearest Laura!" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Ah, no!" she said, speaking with no touch of anger, but all in\r\nsorrow;--"it must not be like that. There is no room for that. Nor do\r\nyou mean it. I do not think so ill of you. But there may not be even\r\nwords of affection between us--only such as I may speak to make you\r\nknow that I am your friend."\r\n\r\n"You are my friend," he said, stretching out his hand to her as he\r\nturned away his face. "You are my friend, indeed."\r\n\r\n"Then do as I would have you do."\r\n\r\nHe put his hand into his pocket, and had the letter between his\r\nfingers with the purport of showing it to her. But at the moment\r\nthe thought occurred to him that were he to do so, then, indeed, he\r\nwould be bound for ever. He knew that he was bound for ever,--bound\r\nfor ever to his own Mary; but he desired to have the privilege of\r\nthinking over such bondage once more before he proclaimed it even to\r\nhis dearest friend. He had told her that she tempted him, and she\r\nstood before him now as a temptress. But lest it might be possible\r\nthat she should not tempt in vain,--that letter in his pocket must\r\nnever be shown to her. In that case Lady Laura must never hear from\r\nhis lips the name of Mary Flood Jones.\r\n\r\nHe left her without any assured purpose;--without, that is, the\r\nassurance to her of any fixed purpose. There yet wanted a week to the\r\nday on which Mr. Monk\'s bill was to be read,--or not to be read,--the\r\nsecond time; and he had still that interval before he need decide.\r\nHe went to his club, and before he dined he strove to write a line\r\nto Mary;--but when he had the paper before him he found that it was\r\nimpossible to do so. Though he did not even suspect himself of an\r\nintention to be false, the idea that was in his mind made the effort\r\ntoo much for him. He put the paper away from him and went down and\r\neat his dinner.\r\n\r\nIt was a Saturday, and there was no House in the evening. He had\r\nremained in Portman Square with Lady Laura till near seven o\'clock,\r\nand was engaged to go out in the evening to a gathering at Mrs.\r\nGresham\'s house. Everybody in London would be there, and Phineas\r\nwas resolved that as long as he remained in London he would be seen\r\nat places where everybody was seen. He would certainly be at Mrs.\r\nGresham\'s gathering; but there was an hour or two before he need\r\ngo home to dress, and as he had nothing to do, he went down to the\r\nsmoking-room of his club. The seats were crowded, but there was\r\none vacant; and before he had looked about him to scrutinise his\r\nneighbourhood, he found that he had placed himself with Bonteen on\r\nhis right hand and Ratler on his left. There were no two men in all\r\nLondon whom he more thoroughly disliked; but it was too late for him\r\nto avoid them now.\r\n\r\nThey instantly attacked him, first on one side and then on the other.\r\n"So I am told you are going to leave us," said Bonteen.\r\n\r\n"Who can have been ill-natured enough to whisper such a thing?"\r\nreplied Phineas.\r\n\r\n"The whispers are very loud, I can tell you," said Ratler. "I think I\r\nknow already pretty nearly how every man in the House will vote, and\r\nI have not got your name down on the right side."\r\n\r\n"Change it for heaven\'s sake," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"I will, if you\'ll tell me seriously that I may," said Ratler.\r\n\r\n"My opinion is," said Bonteen, "that a man should be known either as\r\na friend or foe. I respect a declared foe."\r\n\r\n"Know me as a declared foe then," said Phineas, "and respect me."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all very well," said Ratler, "but it means nothing. I\'ve\r\nalways had a sort of fear about you, Finn, that you would go over the\r\ntraces some day. Of course it\'s a very grand thing to be\r\nindependent."\r\n\r\n"The finest thing in the world," said Bonteen; "only so d----d\r\nuseless."\r\n\r\n"But a man shouldn\'t be independent and stick to the ship at the\r\nsame time. You forget the trouble you cause, and how you upset all\r\ncalculations."\r\n\r\n"I hadn\'t thought of the calculations," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"The fact is, Finn," said Bonteen, "you are made of clay too fine for\r\noffice. I\'ve always found it has been so with men from your country.\r\nYou are the grandest horses in the world to look at out on a prairie,\r\nbut you don\'t like the slavery of harness."\r\n\r\n"And the sound of a whip over our shoulders sets us kicking;--does it\r\nnot, Ratler?"\r\n\r\n"I shall show the list to Gresham to-morrow," said Ratler, "and of\r\ncourse he can do as he pleases; but I don\'t understand this kind of\r\nthing."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you be in a hurry," said Bonteen. "I\'ll bet you a sovereign\r\nFinn votes with us yet. There\'s nothing like being a little coy to\r\nset off a girl\'s charms. I\'ll bet you a sovereign, Ratler, that Finn\r\ngoes out into the lobby with you and me against Monk\'s bill."\r\n\r\nPhineas, not being able to stand any more of this most unpleasant\r\nraillery, got up and went away. The club was distasteful to him, and\r\nhe walked off and sauntered for a while about the park. He went down\r\nby the Duke of York\'s column as though he were going to his office,\r\nwhich of course was closed at this hour, but turned round when he\r\ngot beyond the new public buildings,--buildings which he was never\r\ndestined to use in their completed state,--and entered the gates of\r\nthe enclosure, and wandered on over the bridge across the water. As\r\nhe went his mind was full of thought. Could it be good for him to\r\ngive up everything for a fair face? He swore to himself that of all\r\nwomen whom he had ever seen Mary was the sweetest and the dearest and\r\nthe best. If it could be well to lose the world for a woman, it would\r\nbe well to lose it for her. Violet, with all her skill, and all her\r\nstrength, and all her grace, could never have written such a letter\r\nas that which he still held in his pocket. The best charm of a woman\r\nis that she should be soft, and trusting, and generous; and who ever\r\nhad been more soft, more trusting, and more generous than his Mary?\r\nOf course he would be true to her, though he did lose the world.\r\n\r\nBut to yield such a triumph to the Ratlers and Bonteens whom he left\r\nbehind him,--to let them have their will over him,--to know that they\r\nwould rejoice scurrilously behind his back over his downfall! The\r\nfeeling was terrible to him. The last words which Bonteen had spoken\r\nmade it impossible to him now not to support his old friend Mr. Monk.\r\nIt was not only what Bonteen had said, but that the words of Mr.\r\nBonteen so plainly indicated what would be the words of all the other\r\nBonteens. He knew that he was weak in this. He knew that had he been\r\nstrong, he would have allowed himself to be guided,--if not by the\r\nfirm decision of his own spirit,--by the counsels of such men as Mr.\r\nGresham and Lord Cantrip, and not by the sarcasms of the Bonteens and\r\nRatlers of official life. But men who sojourn amidst savagery fear\r\nthe mosquito more than they do the lion. He could not bear to think\r\nthat he should yield his blood to such a one as Bonteen.\r\n\r\nAnd he must yield his blood, unless he could vote for Mr. Monk\'s\r\nmotion, and hold his ground afterwards among them all in the House\r\nof Commons. He would at any rate see the session out, and try a\r\nfall with Mr. Bonteen when they should be sitting on different\r\nbenches,--if ever fortune should give him an opportunity. And in the\r\nmeantime, what should he do about Madame Goesler? What a fate was his\r\nto have the handsomest woman in London with thousands and thousands\r\na year at his disposal! For,--so he now swore to himself,--Madame\r\nGoesler was the handsomest woman in London, as Mary Flood Jones was\r\nthe sweetest girl in the world.\r\n\r\nHe had not arrived at any decision so fixed as to make him\r\ncomfortable when he went home and dressed for Mrs. Gresham\'s party.\r\nAnd yet he knew,--he thought that he knew that he would be true to\r\nMary Flood Jones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister\'s House\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rooms and passages and staircases at Mrs. Gresham\'s house were\r\nvery crowded when Phineas arrived there. Men of all shades of\r\npolitics were there, and the wives and daughters of such men; and\r\nthere was a streak of royalty in one of the saloons, and a whole\r\nrainbow of foreign ministers with their stars, and two blue ribbons\r\nwere to be seen together on the first landing-place, with a stout\r\nlady between them carrying diamonds enough to load a pannier.\r\nEverybody was there. Phineas found that even Lord Chiltern was come,\r\nas he stumbled across his friend on the first foot-ground that he\r\ngained in his ascent towards the rooms. "Halloa,--you here?" said\r\nPhineas. "Yes, by George!" said the other, "but I am going to escape\r\nas soon as possible. I\'ve been trying to make my way up for the last\r\nhour, but could never get round that huge promontory there. Laura was\r\nmore persevering." "Is Kennedy here?" Phineas whispered. "I do not\r\nknow," said Chiltern, "but she was determined to run the chance."\r\n\r\nA little higher up,--for Phineas was blessed with more patience than\r\nLord Chiltern possessed,--he came upon Mr. Monk. "So you are still\r\nadmitted privately," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear yes,--and we have just been having a most friendly\r\nconversation about you. What a man he is! He knows everything. He\r\nis so accurate; so just in the abstract,--and in the abstract so\r\ngenerous!"\r\n\r\n"He has been very generous to me in detail as well as in abstract,"\r\nsaid Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes; I am not thinking of individuals exactly. His want of\r\ngenerosity is to large masses,--to a party, to classes, to a people;\r\nwhereas his generosity is for mankind at large. He assumes the god,\r\naffects to nod, and seems to shake the spheres. But I have nothing\r\nagainst him. He has asked me here to-night, and has talked to me most\r\nfamiliarly about Ireland."\r\n\r\n"What do you think of your chance of a second reading?" asked\r\nPhineas.\r\n\r\n"What do you think of it?--you hear more of those things than I do."\r\n\r\n"Everybody says it will be a close division."\r\n\r\n"I never expected it," said Mr. Monk.\r\n\r\n"Nor I, till I heard what Daubeny said at the first reading. They\r\nwill all vote for the bill en masse,--hating it in their hearts all\r\nthe time."\r\n\r\n"Let us hope they are not so bad as that."\r\n\r\n"It is the way with them always. They do all our work for\r\nus,--sailing either on one tack or the other. That is their use in\r\ncreation, that when we split among ourselves, as we always do, they\r\ncome in and finish our job for us. It must be unpleasant for them to\r\nbe always doing that which they always say should never be done at\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"Wherever the gift horse may come from, I shall not look it in the\r\nmouth," said Mr. Monk. "There is only one man in the House whom I\r\nhope I may not see in the lobby with me, and that is yourself."\r\n\r\n"The question is decided now," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"And how is it decided?"\r\n\r\nPhineas could not tell his friend that a question of so great\r\nmagnitude to him had been decided by the last sting which he had\r\nreceived from an insect so contemptible as Mr. Bonteen, but he\r\nexpressed the feeling as well as he knew how to express it. "Oh, I\r\nshall be with you. I know what you are going to say, and I know how\r\ngood you are. But I could not stand it. Men are beginning already to\r\nsay things which almost make me get up and kick them. If I can help\r\nit, I will give occasion to no man to hint anything to me which\r\ncan make me be so wretched as I have been to-day. Pray do not say\r\nanything more. My idea is that I shall resign to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Then I hope that we may fight the battle side by side," said Mr.\r\nMonk, giving him his hand.\r\n\r\n"We will fight the battle side by side," replied Phineas.\r\n\r\nAfter that he pushed his way still higher up the stairs, having no\r\nspecial purpose in view, not dreaming of any such success as that\r\nof reaching his host or hostess,--merely feeling that it should be\r\na point of honour with him to make a tour through the rooms before\r\nhe descended the stairs. The thing, he thought, was to be done with\r\ncourage and patience, and this might, probably, be the last time in\r\nhis life that he would find himself in the house of a Prime Minister.\r\nJust at the turn of the balustrade at the top of the stairs, he found\r\nMr. Gresham in the very spot on which Mr. Monk had been talking with\r\nhim. "Very glad to see you," said Mr. Gresham. "You, I find, are a\r\npersevering man, with a genius for getting upwards."\r\n\r\n"Like the sparks," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Not quite so quickly," said Mr. Gresham.\r\n\r\n"But with the same assurance of speedy loss of my little light."\r\n\r\nIt did not suit Mr. Gresham to understand this, so he changed the\r\nsubject. "Have you seen the news from America?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have seen it, but do not believe it," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you have such faith in a combination of British colonies,\r\nproperly backed in Downing Street, as to think them strong\r\nagainst a world in arms. In your place I should hold to the same\r\ndoctrine,--hold to it stoutly."\r\n\r\n"And you do now, I hope, Mr. Gresham?"\r\n\r\n"Well,--yes,--I am not down-hearted. But I confess to a feeling that\r\nthe world would go on even though we had nothing to say to a single\r\nprovince in North America. But that is for your private ear. You are\r\nnot to whisper that in Downing Street." Then there came up somebody\r\nelse, and Phineas went on upon his slow course. He had longed for an\r\nopportunity to tell Mr. Gresham that he could go to Downing Street no\r\nmore, but such opportunity had not reached him.\r\n\r\nFor a long time he found himself stuck close by the side of Miss\r\nFitzgibbon,--Miss Aspasia Fitzgibbon,--who had once relieved him from\r\nterrible pecuniary anxiety by paying for him a sum of money which was\r\ndue by him on her brother\'s account. "It\'s a very nice thing to be\r\nhere, but one does get tired of it," said Miss Fitzgibbon.\r\n\r\n"Very tired," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Of course it is a part of your duty, Mr. Finn. You are on your\r\npromotion and are bound to be here. When I asked Laurence to come, he\r\nsaid there was nothing to be got till the cards were shuffled again."\r\n\r\n"They\'ll be shuffled very soon," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Whatever colour comes up, you\'ll hold trumps, I know," said the\r\nlady. "Some hands always hold trumps." He could not explain to Miss\r\nFitzgibbon that it would never again be his fate to hold a single\r\ntrump in his hand; so he made another fight, and got on a few steps\r\nfarther.\r\n\r\nHe said a word as he went to half a dozen friends,--as friends went\r\nwith him. He was detained for five minutes by Lady Baldock, who was\r\nvery gracious and very disagreeable. She told him that Violet was in\r\nthe room, but where she did not know. "She is somewhere with Lady\r\nLaura, I believe; and really, Mr. Finn, I do not like it." Lady\r\nBaldock had heard that Phineas had quarrelled with Lord Brentford,\r\nbut had not heard of the reconciliation. "Really, I do not like it. I\r\nam told that Mr. Kennedy is in the house, and nobody knows what may\r\nhappen."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Kennedy is not likely to say anything."\r\n\r\n"One cannot tell. And when I hear that a woman is separated from her\r\nhusband, I always think that she must have been imprudent. It may be\r\nuncharitable, but I think it is most safe so to consider."\r\n\r\n"As far as I have heard the circumstances, Lady Laura was quite\r\nright," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"It may be so. Gentlemen will always take the lady\'s part,--of\r\ncourse. But I should be very sorry to have a daughter separated from\r\nher husband,--very sorry."\r\n\r\nPhineas, who had nothing now to gain from Lady Baldock\'s favour, left\r\nher abruptly, and went on again. He had a great desire to see Lady\r\nLaura and Violet together, though he could hardly tell himself why.\r\nHe had not seen Miss Effingham since his return from Ireland, and he\r\nthought that if he met her alone he could hardly have talked to her\r\nwith comfort; but he knew that if he met her with Lady Laura, she\r\nwould greet him as a friend, and speak to him as though there were no\r\ncause for embarrassment between them. But he was so far disappointed,\r\nthat he suddenly encountered Violet alone. She had been leaning on\r\nthe arm of Lord Baldock, and Phineas saw her cousin leave her. But\r\nhe would not be such a coward as to avoid her, especially as he knew\r\nthat she had seen him. "Oh, Mr. Finn!" she said, "do you see that?"\r\n\r\n"See what?"\r\n\r\n"Look; There is Mr. Kennedy. We had heard that it was possible, and\r\nLaura made me promise that I would not leave her." Phineas turned his\r\nhead, and saw Mr. Kennedy standing with his back bolt upright against\r\na door-post, with his brow as black as thunder. "She is just opposite\r\nto him, where he can see her," said Violet. "Pray take me to her. He\r\nwill think nothing of you, because I know that you are still friends\r\nwith both of them. I came away because Lord Baldock wanted to\r\nintroduce me to Lady Mouser. You know he is going to marry Miss\r\nMouser."\r\n\r\nPhineas, not caring much about Lord Baldock and Miss Mouser, took\r\nViolet\'s hand upon his arm, and very slowly made his way across\r\nthe room to the spot indicated. There they found Lady Laura alone,\r\nsitting under the upas-tree influence of her husband\'s gaze. There\r\nwas a concourse of people between them, and Mr. Kennedy did not seem\r\ninclined to make any attempt to lessen the distance. But Lady Laura\r\nhad found it impossible to move while she was under her husband\'s\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Finn," she said, "could you find Oswald? I know he is here."\r\n\r\n"He has gone," said Phineas. "I was speaking to him downstairs."\r\n\r\n"You have not seen my father? He said he would come."\r\n\r\n"I have not seen him, but I will search."\r\n\r\n"No;--it will do no good. I cannot stay. His carriage is there, I\r\nknow,--waiting for me." Phineas immediately started off to have the\r\ncarriage called, and promised to return with as much celerity as he\r\ncould use. As he went, making his way much quicker through the crowd\r\nthan he had done when he had no such object for haste, he purposely\r\navoided the door by which Mr. Kennedy had stood. It would have been\r\nhis nearest way, but his present service, he thought, required that\r\nhe should keep aloof from the man. But Mr. Kennedy passed through the\r\ndoor and intercepted him in his path.\r\n\r\n"Is she going?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Well. Yes. I dare say she may before long. I shall look for Lord\r\nBrentford\'s carriage by-and-by."\r\n\r\n"Tell her she need not go because of me. I shall not return. I shall\r\nnot annoy her here. It would have been much better that a woman in\r\nsuch a plight should not have come to such an assembly."\r\n\r\n"You would not wish her to shut herself up."\r\n\r\n"I would wish her to come back to the home that she has left, and, if\r\nthere be any law in the land, she shall be made to do so. You tell\r\nher that I say so." Then Mr. Kennedy fought his way down the stairs,\r\nand Phineas Finn followed in his wake.\r\n\r\nAbout half an hour afterwards Phineas returned to the two ladies with\r\ntidings that the carriage would be at hand as soon as they could be\r\nbelow. "Did he see you?" said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"Yes, he followed me."\r\n\r\n"And did he speak to you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--he spoke to me."\r\n\r\n"And what did he say?" And then, in the presence of Violet, Phineas\r\ngave the message. He thought it better that it should be given;\r\nand were he to decline to deliver it now, it would never be given.\r\n"Whether there be law in the land to protect me or whether there be\r\nnone, I will never live with him," said Lady Laura. "Is a woman like\r\na head of cattle, that she can be fastened in her crib by force? I\r\nwill never live with him though all the judges of the land should\r\ndecide that I must do so."\r\n\r\nPhineas thought much of all this as he went to his solitary lodgings.\r\nAfter all, was not the world much better with him than it was with\r\neither of those two wretched married beings? And why? He had not,\r\nat any rate as yet, sacrificed for money or social gains any of\r\nthe instincts of his nature. He had been fickle, foolish, vain,\r\nuncertain, and perhaps covetous;--but as yet he had not been false.\r\nThen he took out Mary\'s last letter and read it again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI\r\n\r\nComparing Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would, perhaps, be difficult to decide,--between Lord Chiltern and\r\nMiss Effingham,--which had been most wrong, or which had been nearest\r\nto the right, in the circumstances which had led to their separation.\r\nThe old lord, wishing to induce his son to undertake work of some\r\nsort, and feeling that his own efforts in this direction were worse\r\nthan useless, had closeted himself with his intended daughter-in-law,\r\nand had obtained from her a promise that she would use her influence\r\nwith her lover. "Of course I think it right that he should do\r\nsomething," Violet had said. "And he will if you bid him," replied\r\nthe Earl. Violet expressed a great doubt as to this willingness of\r\nobedience; but, nevertheless, she promised to do her best, and she\r\ndid her best. Lord Chiltern, when she spoke to him, knit his brows\r\nwith an apparent ferocity of anger which his countenance frequently\r\nexpressed without any intention of ferocity on his part. He was\r\nannoyed, but was not savagely disposed to Violet. As he looked at\r\nher, however, he seemed to be very savagely disposed. "What is it you\r\nwould have me do?" he said.\r\n\r\n"I would have you choose some occupation, Oswald."\r\n\r\n"What occupation? What is it that you mean? Ought I to be a\r\nshoemaker?"\r\n\r\n"Not that by preference, I should say; but that if you please." When\r\nher lover had frowned at her, Violet had resolved,--had strongly\r\ndetermined, with inward assertions of her own rights,--that she would\r\nnot be frightened by him.\r\n\r\n"You are talking nonsense, Violet. You know that I cannot be a\r\nshoemaker."\r\n\r\n"You may go into Parliament."\r\n\r\n"I neither can, nor would I if I could. I dislike the life."\r\n\r\n"You might farm."\r\n\r\n"I cannot afford it."\r\n\r\n"You might,--might do anything. You ought to do something. You know\r\nthat you ought. You know that your father is right in what he says."\r\n\r\n"That is easily asserted, Violet; but it would, I think, be better\r\nthat you should take my part than my father\'s, if it be that you\r\nintend to be my wife."\r\n\r\n"You know that I intend to be your wife; but would you wish that I\r\nshould respect my husband?"\r\n\r\n"And will you not do so if you marry me?" he asked.\r\n\r\nThen Violet looked into his face and saw that the frown was blacker\r\nthan ever. The great mark down his forehead was deeper and more\r\nlike an ugly wound than she had ever seen it; and his eyes sparkled\r\nwith anger; and his face was red as with fiery wrath. If it was so\r\nwith him when she was no more than engaged to him, how would it be\r\nwhen they should be man and wife? At any rate, she would not fear\r\nhim,--not now at least. "No, Oswald," she said. "If you resolve upon\r\nbeing an idle man, I shall not respect you. It is better that I\r\nshould tell you the truth."\r\n\r\n"A great deal better," he said.\r\n\r\n"How can I respect one whose whole life will be,--will be--?"\r\n\r\n"Will be what?" he demanded with a loud shout.\r\n\r\n"Oswald, you are very rough with me."\r\n\r\n"What do you say that my life will be?"\r\n\r\nThen she again resolved that she would not fear him. "It will be\r\ndiscreditable," she said.\r\n\r\n"It shall not discredit you," he replied. "I will not bring disgrace\r\non one I have loved so well. Violet, after what you have said, we had\r\nbetter part." She was still proud, still determined, and they did\r\npart. Though it nearly broke her heart to see him leave her, she bid\r\nhim go. She hated herself afterwards for her severity to him; but,\r\nnevertheless, she would not submit to recall the words which she\r\nhad spoken. She had thought him to be wrong, and, so thinking, had\r\nconceived it to be her duty and her privilege to tell him what she\r\nthought. But she had no wish to lose him;--no wish not to be his wife\r\neven, though he should be as idle as the wind. She was so constituted\r\nthat she had never allowed him or any other man to be master of her\r\nheart,--till she had with a full purpose given her heart away. The\r\nday before she had resolved to give it to one man, she might, I\r\nthink, have resolved to give it to another. Love had not conquered\r\nher, but had been taken into her service. Nevertheless, she could\r\nnot now rid herself of her servant, when she found that his services\r\nwould stand her no longer in good stead. She parted from Lord\r\nChiltern with an assent, with an assured brow, and with much dignity\r\nin her gait; but as soon as she was alone she was a prey to remorse.\r\nShe had declared to the man who was to have been her husband that\r\nhis life was discreditable,--and, of course, no man would bear such\r\nlanguage. Had Lord Chiltern borne it, he would not have been worthy\r\nof her love.\r\n\r\nShe herself told Lady Laura and Lord Brentford what had\r\noccurred,--and had told Lady Baldock also. Lady Baldock had, of\r\ncourse, triumphed,--and Violet sought her revenge by swearing that\r\nshe would regret for ever the loss of so inestimable a gentleman.\r\n"Then why have you given him up, my dear?" demanded Lady Baldock.\r\n"Because I found that he was too good for me," said Violet. It may be\r\ndoubtful whether Lady Baldock was not justified, when she declared\r\nthat her niece was to her a care so harassing that no aunt known in\r\nhistory had ever been so troubled before.\r\n\r\nLord Brentford had fussed and fumed, and had certainly made things\r\nworse. He had quarrelled with his son, and then made it up, and then\r\nquarrelled again,--swearing that the fault must all be attributed to\r\nChiltern\'s stubbornness and Chiltern\'s temper. Latterly, however, by\r\nLady Laura\'s intervention, Lord Brentford and his son had again been\r\nreconciled, and the Earl endeavoured manfully to keep his tongue from\r\ndisagreeable words, and his face from evil looks, when his son was\r\npresent. "They will make it up," Lady Laura had said, "if you and I\r\ndo not attempt to make it up for them. If we do, they will never come\r\ntogether." The Earl was convinced, and did his best. But the task\r\nwas very difficult to him. How was he to keep his tongue off his son\r\nwhile his son was daily saying things of which any father,--any such\r\nfather as Lord Brentford,--could not but disapprove? Lord Chiltern\r\nprofessed to disbelieve even in the wisdom of the House of Lords, and\r\non one occasion asserted that it must be a great comfort to any Prime\r\nMinister to have three or four old women in the Cabinet. The father,\r\nwhen he heard this, tried to rebuke his son tenderly, strove even to\r\nbe jocose. It was the one wish of his heart that Violet Effingham\r\nshould be his daughter-in-law. But even with this wish he found it\r\nvery hard to keep his tongue off Lord Chiltern.\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Laura discussed the matter with Violet, Violet would always\r\ndeclare that there was no hope. "The truth is," she said on the\r\nmorning of that day on which they both went to Mrs. Gresham\'s, "that\r\nthough we like each other,--love each other, if you choose to say\r\nso,--we are not fit to be man and wife."\r\n\r\n"And why not fit?"\r\n\r\n"We are too much alike. Each is too violent, too headstrong, and too\r\nmasterful."\r\n\r\n"You, as the woman, ought to give way," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"But we do not always do just what we ought."\r\n\r\n"I know how difficult it is for me to advise, seeing to what a pass I\r\nhave brought myself."\r\n\r\n"Do not say that, dear;--or rather do say it, for we have, both of\r\nus, brought ourselves to what you call a pass,--to such a pass that\r\nwe are like to be able to live together and discuss it for the rest\r\nof our lives. The difference is, I take it, that you have not to\r\naccuse yourself, and that I have."\r\n\r\n"I cannot say that I have not to accuse myself," said Lady Laura.\r\n"I do not know that I have done much wrong to Mr. Kennedy since I\r\nmarried him; but in marrying him I did him a grievous wrong."\r\n\r\n"And he has avenged himself."\r\n\r\n"We will not talk of vengeance. I believe he is wretched, and I know\r\nthat I am;--and that has come of the wrong that I have done."\r\n\r\n"I will make no man wretched," said Violet.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that your mind is made up against Oswald?"\r\n\r\n"I mean that, and I mean much more. I say that I will make no man\r\nwretched. Your brother is not the only man who is so weak as to be\r\nwilling to run the hazard."\r\n\r\n"There is Lord Fawn."\r\n\r\n"Yes, there is Lord Fawn, certainly. Perhaps I should not do him much\r\nharm; but then I should do him no good."\r\n\r\n"And poor Phineas Finn."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--there is Mr. Finn. I will tell you something, Laura. The only\r\nman I ever saw in the world whom I have thought for a moment that\r\nit was possible that I should like,--like enough to love as my\r\nhusband,--except your brother, was Mr. Finn."\r\n\r\n"And now?"\r\n\r\n"Oh;--now; of course that is over," said Violet.\r\n\r\n"It is over?"\r\n\r\n"Quite over. Is he not going to marry Madame Goesler? I suppose\r\nall that is fixed by this time. I hope she will be good to him,\r\nand gracious, and let him have his own way, and give him his tea\r\ncomfortably when he comes up tired from the House; for I confess that\r\nmy heart is a little tender towards Phineas still. I should not like\r\nto think that he had fallen into the hands of a female Philistine."\r\n\r\n"I do not think he will marry Madame Goesler."\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"I can hardly tell you;--but I do not think he will. And you loved\r\nhim once,--eh, Violet?"\r\n\r\n"Not quite that, my dear. It has been difficult with me to love. The\r\ndifficulty with most girls, I fancy, is not to love. Mr. Finn, when I\r\ncame to measure him in my mind, was not small, but he was never quite\r\ntall enough. One feels oneself to be a sort of recruiting sergeant,\r\ngoing about with a standard of inches. Mr. Finn was just half an inch\r\ntoo short. He lacks something in individuality. He is a little too\r\nmuch a friend to everybody."\r\n\r\n"Shall I tell you a secret, Violet?"\r\n\r\n"If you please, dear; though I fancy it is one I know already."\r\n\r\n"He is the only man whom I ever loved," said Lady Laura.\r\n\r\n"But it was too late when you learned to love him," said Violet.\r\n\r\n"It was too late, when I was so sure of it as to wish that I had\r\nnever seen Mr. Kennedy. I felt it coming on me, and I argued with\r\nmyself that such a marriage would be bad for us both. At that moment\r\nthere was trouble in the family, and I had not a shilling of my own."\r\n\r\n"You had paid it for Oswald."\r\n\r\n"At any rate, I had nothing;--and he had nothing. How could I have\r\ndared to think even of such a marriage?"\r\n\r\n"Did he think of it, Laura?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose he did."\r\n\r\n"You know he did. Did you not tell me before?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--yes. He thought of it. I had come to some foolish,\r\nhalf-sentimental resolution as to friendship, believing that he and I\r\ncould be knit together by some adhesion of fraternal affection that\r\nshould be void of offence to my husband; and in furtherance of this\r\nhe was asked to Loughlinter when I went there, just after I had\r\naccepted Robert. He came down, and I measured him too, as you have\r\ndone. I measured him, and I found that he wanted nothing to come up\r\nto the height required by my standard. I think I knew him better than\r\nyou did."\r\n\r\n"Very possibly;--but why measure him at all, when such measurement\r\nwas useless?"\r\n\r\n"Can one help such things? He came to me one day as I was sitting up\r\nby the Linter. You remember the place, where it makes its first\r\nleap."\r\n\r\n"I remember it very well."\r\n\r\n"So do I. Robert had shown it me as the fairest spot in all\r\nScotland."\r\n\r\n"And there this lover of ours sang his song to you?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know what he told me then; but I know that I told him that\r\nI was engaged; and I felt when I told him so that my engagement was a\r\nsorrow to me. And it has been a sorrow from that day to this."\r\n\r\n"And the hero, Phineas,--he is still dear to you?"\r\n\r\n"Dear to me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. You would have hated me, had he become my husband? And you will\r\nhate Madame Goesler when she becomes his wife?"\r\n\r\n"Not in the least. I am no dog in the manger. I have even gone so far\r\nas almost to wish, at certain moments, that you should accept him."\r\n\r\n"And why?"\r\n\r\n"Because he has wished it so heartily."\r\n\r\n"One can hardly forgive a man for such speedy changes," said Violet.\r\n\r\n"Was I not to forgive him;--I, who had turned myself away from him\r\nwith a fixed purpose the moment that I found that he had made a mark\r\nupon my heart? I could not wipe off the mark, and yet I married. Was\r\nhe not to try to wipe off his mark?"\r\n\r\n"It seems that he wiped it off very quickly;--and since that he has\r\nwiped off another mark. One doesn\'t know how many marks he has wiped\r\noff. They are like the inn-keeper\'s score which he makes in chalk. A\r\ndamp cloth brings them all away, and leaves nothing behind."\r\n\r\n"What would you have?"\r\n\r\n"There should be a little notch on the stick,--to remember by," said\r\nViolet. "Not that I complain, you know. I cannot complain, as I was\r\nnot notched myself."\r\n\r\n"You are silly, Violet."\r\n\r\n"In not having allowed myself to be notched by this great champion?"\r\n\r\n"A man like Mr. Finn has his life to deal with,--to make the most\r\nof it, and to divide it between work, pleasure, duty, ambition, and\r\nthe rest of it as best he may. If he have any softness of heart, it\r\nwill be necessary to him that love should bear a part in all these\r\ninterests. But a man will be a fool who will allow love to be the\r\nmaster of them all. He will be one whose mind is so ill-balanced\r\nas to allow him to be the victim of a single wish. Even in a woman\r\npassion such as that is evidence of weakness, and not of strength."\r\n\r\n"It seems, then, Laura, that you are weak."\r\n\r\n"And if I am, does that condemn him? He is a man, if I judge him\r\nrightly, who will be constant as the sun, when constancy can be of\r\nservice."\r\n\r\n"You mean that the future Mrs. Finn will be secure?"\r\n\r\n"That is what I mean;--and that you or I, had either of us chosen to\r\ntake his name, might have been quite secure. We have thought it right\r\nto refuse to do so."\r\n\r\n"And how many more, I wonder?"\r\n\r\n"You are unjust, and unkind, Violet. So unjust and unkind that it is\r\nclear to me he has just gratified your vanity, and has never touched\r\nyour heart. What would you have had him do, when I told him that I\r\nwas engaged?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose that Mr. Kennedy would not have gone to Blankenberg with\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Violet!"\r\n\r\n"That seems to be the proper thing to do. But even that does not\r\nadjust things finally;--does it?" Then some one came upon them, and\r\nthe conversation was brought to an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXII\r\n\r\nMadame Goesler\'s Generosity\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Phineas Finn left Mr. Gresham\'s house he had quite resolved what\r\nhe would do. On the next morning he would tell Lord Cantrip that his\r\nresignation was a necessity, and that he would take that nobleman\'s\r\nadvice as to resigning at once, or waiting till the day on which Mr.\r\nMonk\'s Irish Bill would be read for the second time.\r\n\r\n"My dear Finn, I can only say that I deeply regret it," said Lord\r\nCantrip.\r\n\r\n"So do I. I regret to leave office, which I like,--and which indeed\r\nI want. I regret specially to leave this office, as it has been a\r\nthorough pleasure to me; and I regret, above all, to leave you. But\r\nI am convinced that Monk is right, and I find it impossible not to\r\nsupport him."\r\n\r\n"I wish that Mr. Monk was at Bath," said Lord Cantrip.\r\n\r\nPhineas could only smile, and shrug his shoulders, and say that\r\neven though Mr. Monk were at Bath it would not probably make much\r\ndifference. When he tendered his letter of resignation, Lord Cantrip\r\nbegged him to withdraw it for a day or two. He would, he said, speak\r\nto Mr. Gresham. The debate on the second reading of Mr. Monk\'s bill\r\nwould not take place till that day week, and the resignation would\r\nbe in time if it was tendered before Phineas either spoke or voted\r\nagainst the Government. So Phineas went back to his room, and\r\nendeavoured to make himself useful in some work appertaining to his\r\nfavourite Colonies.\r\n\r\nThat conversation had taken place on a Friday, and on the\r\nfollowing Sunday, early in the day, he left his rooms after a late\r\nbreakfast,--a prolonged breakfast, during which he had been studying\r\ntenant-right statistics, preparing his own speech, and endeavouring\r\nto look forward into the future which that speech was to do so much\r\nto influence,--and turned his face towards Park Lane. There had been\r\na certain understanding between him and Madame Goesler that he was\r\nto call in Park Lane on this Sunday morning, and then declare to her\r\nwhat was his final resolve as to the office which he held. "It is\r\nsimply to bid her adieu," he said to himself, "for I shall hardly\r\nsee her again." And yet, as he took off his morning easy coat, and\r\ndressed himself for the streets, and stood for a moment before his\r\nlooking-glass, and saw that his gloves were fresh and that his boots\r\nwere properly polished, I think there was a care about his person\r\nwhich he would have hardly taken had he been quite assured that he\r\nsimply intended to say good-bye to the lady whom he was about to\r\nvisit. But if there were any such conscious feeling, he administered\r\nto himself an antidote before he left the house. On returning to the\r\nsitting-room he went to a little desk from which he took out the\r\nletter from Mary which the reader has seen, and carefully perused\r\nevery word of it. "She is the best of them all," he said to himself,\r\nas he refolded the letter and put it back into his desk. I am not\r\nsure that it is well that a man should have any large number from\r\nwhom to select a best; as, in such circumstances, he is so very apt\r\nto change his judgment from hour to hour. The qualities which are the\r\nmost attractive before dinner sometimes become the least so in the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nThe morning was warm, and he took a cab. It would not do that he\r\nshould speak even his last farewell to such a one as Madame Goesler\r\nwith all the heat and dust of a long walk upon him. Having been so\r\ncareful about his boots and gloves he might as well use his care to\r\nthe end. Madame Goesler was a very pretty woman, who spared herself\r\nno trouble in making herself as pretty as Nature would allow, on\r\nbehalf of those whom she favoured with her smiles; and to such a lady\r\nsome special attention was due by one who had received so many of her\r\nsmiles as had Phineas. And he felt, too, that there was something\r\nspecial in this very visit. It was to be made by appointment, and\r\nthere had come to be an understanding between them that Phineas\r\nshould tell her on this occasion what was his resolution with\r\nreference to his future life. I think that he had been very wise in\r\nfortifying himself with a further glance at our dear Mary\'s letter,\r\nbefore he trusted himself within Madame Goesler\'s door.\r\n\r\nYes;--Madame Goesler was at home. The door was opened by Madame\r\nGoesler\'s own maid, who, smiling, explained that the other servants\r\nwere all at church. Phineas had become sufficiently intimate at the\r\ncottage in Park Lane to be on friendly terms with Madame Goesler\'s\r\nown maid, and now made some little half-familiar remark as to the\r\npropriety of his visit during church time. "Madame will not refuse to\r\nsee you, I am thinking," said the girl, who was a German. "And she\r\nis alone?" asked Phineas. "Alone? Yes;--of course she is alone. Who\r\nshould be with her now?" Then she took him up into the drawing-room;\r\nbut, when there, he found that Madame Goesler was absent. "She shall\r\nbe down directly," said the girl. "I shall tell her who is here, and\r\nshe will come."\r\n\r\nIt was a very pretty room. It may almost be said that there could be\r\nno prettier room in all London. It looked out across certain small\r\nprivate gardens,--which were as bright and gay as money could make\r\nthem when brought into competition with London smoke,--right on to\r\nthe park. Outside and inside the window, flowers and green things\r\nwere so arranged that the room itself almost looked as though it\r\nwere a bower in a garden. And everything in that bower was rich and\r\nrare; and there was nothing there which annoyed by its rarity or was\r\ndistasteful by its richness. The seats, though they were costly as\r\nmoney could buy, were meant for sitting, and were comfortable as\r\nseats. There were books for reading, and the means of reading them.\r\nTwo or three gems of English art were hung upon the walls, and\r\ncould be seen backwards and forwards in the mirrors. And there\r\nwere precious toys lying here and there about the room,--toys very\r\nprecious, but placed there not because of their price, but because of\r\ntheir beauty. Phineas already knew enough of the art of living to be\r\naware that the woman who had made that room what it was, had charms\r\nto add a beauty to everything she touched. What would such a life as\r\nhis want, if graced by such a companion,--such a life as his might\r\nbe, if the means which were hers were at his command? It would want\r\none thing, he thought,--the self-respect which he would lose if he\r\nwere false to the girl who was trusting him with such sweet trust at\r\nhome in Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn a very few minutes Madame Goesler was with him, and, though he did\r\nnot think about it, he perceived that she was bright in her apparel,\r\nthat her hair was as soft as care could make it, and that every charm\r\nbelonging to her had been brought into use for his gratification. He\r\nalmost told himself that he was there in order that he might ask to\r\nhave all those charms bestowed upon himself. He did not know who had\r\nlately come to Park Lane and been a suppliant for the possession of\r\nthose rich endowments; but I wonder whether they would have been more\r\nprecious in his eyes had he known that they had so moved the heart\r\nof the great Duke as to have induced him to lay his coronet at the\r\nlady\'s feet. I think that had he known that the lady had refused the\r\ncoronet, that knowledge would have enhanced the value of the prize.\r\n\r\n"I am so sorry to have kept you waiting," she said, as she gave him\r\nher hand. "I was an owl not to be ready for you when you told me that\r\nyou would come."\r\n\r\n"No;--but a bird of paradise to come to me so sweetly, and at an\r\nhour when all the other birds refuse to show the feather of a single\r\nwing."\r\n\r\n"And you,--you feel like a naughty boy, do you not, in thus coming\r\nout on a Sunday morning?"\r\n\r\n"Do you feel like a naughty girl?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--just a little so. I do not know that I should care for\r\neverybody to hear that I received visitors,--or worse still, a\r\nvisitor,--at this hour on this day. But then it is so pleasant to\r\nfeel oneself to be naughty! There is a Bohemian flavour of picnic\r\nabout it which, though it does not come up to the rich gusto of\r\nreal wickedness, makes one fancy that one is on the border of that\r\ndelightful region in which there is none of the constraint of\r\ncustom,--where men and women say what they like, and do what they\r\nlike."\r\n\r\n"It is pleasant enough to be on the borders," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"That is just it. Of course decency, morality, and propriety, all\r\nmade to suit the eye of the public, are the things which are really\r\ndelightful. We all know that, and live accordingly,--as well as we\r\ncan. I do at least."\r\n\r\n"And do not I, Madame Goesler?"\r\n\r\n"I know nothing about that, Mr. Finn, and want to ask no questions.\r\nBut if you do, I am sure you agree with me that you often envy the\r\nimproper people,--the Bohemians,--the people who don\'t trouble\r\nthemselves about keeping any laws except those for breaking which\r\nthey would be put into nasty, unpleasant prisons. I envy them. Oh,\r\nhow I envy them!"\r\n\r\n"But you are free as air."\r\n\r\n"The most cabined, cribbed, and confined creature in the world! I\r\nhave been fighting my way up for the last four years, and have not\r\nallowed myself the liberty of one flirtation;--not often even the\r\nrecreation of a natural laugh. And now I shouldn\'t wonder if I don\'t\r\nfind myself falling back a year or two, just because I have allowed\r\nyou to come and see me on a Sunday morning. When I told Lotta that\r\nyou were coming, she shook her head at me in dismay. But now that you\r\nare here, tell me what you have done."\r\n\r\n"Nothing as yet, Madame Goesler."\r\n\r\n"I thought it was to have been settled on Friday?"\r\n\r\n"It was settled,--before Friday. Indeed, as I look back at it all\r\nnow, I can hardly tell when it was not settled. It is impossible,\r\nand has been impossible, that I should do otherwise. I still hold my\r\nplace, Madame Goesler, but I have declared that I shall give it up\r\nbefore the debate comes on."\r\n\r\n"It is quite fixed?"\r\n\r\n"Quite fixed, my friend."\r\n\r\n"And what next?" Madame Goesler, as she thus interrogated him, was\r\nleaning across towards him from the sofa on which she was placed,\r\nwith both her elbows resting on a small table before her. We all know\r\nthat look of true interest which the countenance of a real friend\r\nwill bear when the welfare of his friend is in question. There are\r\ndoubtless some who can assume it without feeling,--as there are\r\nactors who can personate all the passions. But in ordinary life we\r\nthink that we can trust such a face, and that we know the true look\r\nwhen we see it. Phineas, as he gazed into Madame Goesler\'s eyes, was\r\nsure that the lady opposite him was not acting. She at least was\r\nanxious for his welfare, and was making his cares her own. "What\r\nnext?" said she, repeating her words in a tone that was somewhat\r\nhurried.\r\n\r\n"I do not know that there will be any next. As far as public life is\r\nconcerned, there will be no next for me, Madame Goesler."\r\n\r\n"That is out of the question," she said. "You are made for public\r\nlife."\r\n\r\n"Then I shall be untrue to my making, I fear. But to speak plainly--"\r\n\r\n"Yes; speak plainly. I want to understand the reality."\r\n\r\n"The reality is this. I shall keep my seat to the end of the session,\r\nas I think I may be of use. After that I shall give it up."\r\n\r\n"Resign that too?" she said in a tone of chagrin.\r\n\r\n"The chances are, I think, that there will be another dissolution. If\r\nthey hold their own against Mr. Monk\'s motion, then they will pass an\r\nIrish Reform Bill. After that I think they must dissolve."\r\n\r\n"And you will not come forward again?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot afford it."\r\n\r\n"Psha! Some five hundred pounds or so!"\r\n\r\n"And, besides that, I am well aware that my only chance at my old\r\nprofession is to give up all idea of Parliament. The two things are\r\nnot compatible for a beginner at the law. I know it now, and have\r\nbought my knowledge by a bitter experience."\r\n\r\n"And where will you live?"\r\n\r\n"In Dublin, probably."\r\n\r\n"And you will do,--will do what?"\r\n\r\n"Anything honest in a barrister\'s way that may be brought to me. I\r\nhope that I may never descend below that."\r\n\r\n"You will stand up for all the blackguards, and try to make out that\r\nthe thieves did not steal?"\r\n\r\n"It may be that that sort of work may come in my way."\r\n\r\n"And you will wear a wig and try to look wise?"\r\n\r\n"The wig is not universal in Ireland, Madame Goesler."\r\n\r\n"And you will wrangle, as though your very soul were in it, for\r\nsomebody\'s twenty pounds?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly."\r\n\r\n"You have already made a name in the greatest senate in the world,\r\nand have governed other countries larger than your own--"\r\n\r\n"No;--I have not done that. I have governed no country.\r\n\r\n"I tell you, my friend, that you cannot do it. It is out of the\r\nquestion. Men may move forward from little work to big work; but they\r\ncannot move back and do little work, when they have had tasks which\r\nwere really great. I tell you, Mr. Finn, that the House of Parliament\r\nis the place for you to work in. It is the only place;--that and the\r\nabodes of Ministers. Am not I your friend who tell you this?"\r\n\r\n"I know that you are my friend."\r\n\r\n"And will you not credit me when I tell you this? What do you fear,\r\nthat you should run away? You have no wife;--no children. What is the\r\ncoming misfortune that you dread?" She paused a moment as though for\r\nan answer, and he felt that now had come the time in which it would\r\nbe well that he should tell her of his engagement with his own Mary.\r\nShe had received him very playfully; but now within the last few\r\nminutes there had come upon her a seriousness of gesture, and almost\r\na solemnity of tone, which made him conscious that he should in no\r\nway trifle with her. She was so earnest in her friendship that he\r\nowed it to her to tell her everything. But before he could think of\r\nthe words in which his tale should be told, she had gone on with her\r\nquick questions. "Is it solely about money that you fear?" she said.\r\n\r\n"It is simply that I have no income on which to live."\r\n\r\n"Have I not offered you money?"\r\n\r\n"But, Madame Goesler, you who offer it would yourself despise me if I\r\ntook it."\r\n\r\n"No;--I do deny it." As she said this,--not loudly but with much\r\nemphasis,--she came and stood before him where he was sitting. And as\r\nhe looked at her he could perceive that there was a strength about\r\nher of which he had not been aware. She was stronger, larger, more\r\nrobust physically than he had hitherto conceived. "I do deny it," she\r\nsaid. "Money is neither god nor devil, that it should make one noble\r\nand another vile. It is an accident, and, if honestly possessed, may\r\npass from you to me, or from me to you, without a stain. You may\r\ntake my dinner from me if I give it you, my flowers, my friendship,\r\nmy,--my,--my everything, but my money! Explain to me the cause of the\r\nphenomenon. If I give to you a thousand pounds, now this moment, and\r\nyou take it, you are base;--but if I leave it you in my will,--and\r\ndie,--you take it, and are not base. Explain to me the cause of\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"You have not said it quite all," said Phineas hoarsely.\r\n\r\n"What have I left unsaid? If I have left anything unsaid, do you say\r\nthe rest."\r\n\r\n"It is because you are a woman, and young, and beautiful, that no man\r\nmay take wealth from your hands."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it is that!"\r\n\r\n"It is that partly,"\r\n\r\n"If I were a man you might take it, though I were young and beautiful\r\nas the morning?"\r\n\r\n"No;--presents of money are always bad. They stain and load the\r\nspirit, and break the heart."\r\n\r\n"And specially when given by a woman\'s hand?"\r\n\r\n"It seems so to me. But I cannot argue of it. Do not let us talk of\r\nit any more."\r\n\r\n"Nor can I argue. I cannot argue, but I can be generous,--very\r\ngenerous. I can deny myself for my friend,--can even lower myself in\r\nmy own esteem for my friend. I can do more than a man can do for a\r\nfriend. You will not take money from my hand?"\r\n\r\n"No, Madame Goesler;--I cannot do that."\r\n\r\n"Take the hand then first. When it and all that it holds are your\r\nown, you can help yourself as you list." So saying, she stood before\r\nhim with her right hand stretched out towards him.\r\n\r\nWhat man will say that he would not have been tempted? Or what woman\r\nwill declare that such temptation should have had no force? The very\r\nair of the room in which she dwelt was sweet in his nostrils, and\r\nthere hovered around her an halo of grace and beauty which greeted\r\nall his senses. She invited him to join his lot to hers, in order\r\nthat she might give to him all that was needed to make his life rich\r\nand glorious. How would the Ratlers and the Bonteens envy him when\r\nthey heard of the prize which had become his! The Cantrips and the\r\nGreshams would feel that he was a friend doubly valuable, if he could\r\nbe won back; and Mr. Monk would greet him as a fitting ally,--an ally\r\nstrong with the strength which he had before wanted. With whom would\r\nhe not be equal? Whom need he fear? Who would not praise him? The\r\nstory of his poor Mary would be known only in a small village, out\r\nbeyond the Channel. The temptation certainly was very strong.\r\n\r\nBut he had not a moment in which to doubt. She was standing there\r\nwith her face turned from him, but with her hand still stretched\r\ntowards him. Of course he took it. What man so placed could do other\r\nthan take a woman\'s hand?\r\n\r\n"My friend," he said.\r\n\r\n"I will be called friend by you no more," she said. "You must call me\r\nMarie, your own Marie, or you must never call me by any name again.\r\nWhich shall it be, sir?" He paused a moment, holding her hand, and\r\nshe let it lie there for an instant while she listened. But still she\r\ndid not look at him. "Speak to me! Tell me! Which shall it be?" Still\r\nhe paused. "Speak to me. Tell me!" she said again.\r\n\r\n"It cannot be as you have hinted to me," he said at last. His words\r\ndid not come louder than a low whisper; but they were plainly heard,\r\nand instantly the hand was withdrawn.\r\n\r\n"Cannot be!" she exclaimed. "Then I have betrayed myself."\r\n\r\n"No;--Madame Goesler."\r\n\r\n"Sir; I say yes! If you will allow me I will leave you. You will, I\r\nknow, excuse me if I am abrupt to you." Then she strode out of the\r\nroom, and was no more seen of the eyes of Phineas Finn.\r\n\r\nHe never afterwards knew how he escaped out of that room and found\r\nhis way into Park Lane. In after days he had some memory that he\r\nremained there, he knew not how long, standing on the very spot on\r\nwhich she had left him; and that at last there grew upon him almost a\r\nfear of moving, a dread lest he should be heard, an inordinate desire\r\nto escape without the sound of a footfall, without the clicking of\r\na lock. Everything in that house had been offered to him. He had\r\nrefused it all, and then felt that of all human beings under the\r\nsun none had so little right to be standing there as he. His very\r\npresence in that drawing-room was an insult to the woman whom he had\r\ndriven from it.\r\n\r\nBut at length he was in the street, and had found his way across\r\nPiccadilly into the Green Park. Then, as soon as he could find a spot\r\napart from the Sunday world, he threw himself upon the turf; and\r\ntried to fix his thoughts upon the thing that he had done. His first\r\nfeeling, I think, was one of pure and unmixed disappointment;--of\r\ndisappointment so bitter, that even the vision of his own Mary did\r\nnot tend to comfort him. How great might have been his success, and\r\nhow terrible was his failure! Had he taken the woman\'s hand and her\r\nmoney, had he clenched his grasp on the great prize offered to him,\r\nhis misery would have been ten times worse the first moment that he\r\nwould have been away from her. Then, indeed,--it being so that he\r\nwas a man with a heart within his breast,--there would have been no\r\ncomfort for him, in his outlooks on any side. But even now, when he\r\nhad done right,--knowing well that he had done right,--he found that\r\ncomfort did not come readily within his reach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIII\r\n\r\nAmantium Irae\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Effingham\'s life at this time was not the happiest in the world.\r\nHer lines, as she once said to her friend Lady Laura, were not\r\nlaid for her in pleasant places. Her residence was still with her\r\naunt, and she had come to find that it was almost impossible any\r\nlonger to endure Lady Baldock, and quite impossible to escape from\r\nLady Baldock. In former days she had had a dream that she might\r\nescape, and live alone if she chose to be alone; that she might be\r\nindependent in her life, as a man is independent, if she chose to\r\nlive after that fashion; that she might take her own fortune in her\r\nown hand, as the law certainly allowed her to do, and act with it as\r\nshe might please. But latterly she had learned to understand that all\r\nthis was not possible for her. Though one law allowed it, another law\r\ndisallowed it, and the latter law was at least as powerful as the\r\nformer. And then her present misery was enhanced by the fact that\r\nshe was now banished from the second home which she had formerly\r\npossessed. Hitherto she had always been able to escape from Lady\r\nBaldock to the house of her friend, but now such escape was out of\r\nthe question. Lady Laura and Lord Chiltern lived in the same house,\r\nand Violet could not live with them.\r\n\r\nLady Baldock understood all this, and tortured her niece accordingly.\r\nIt was not premeditated torture. The aunt did not mean to make her\r\nniece\'s life a burden to her, and, so intending, systematically work\r\nupon a principle to that effect. Lady Baldock, no doubt, desired\r\nto do her duty conscientiously. But the result was torture to poor\r\nViolet, and a strong conviction on the mind of each of the two ladies\r\nthat the other was the most unreasonable being in the world.\r\n\r\nThe aunt, in these days, had taken it into her head to talk of poor\r\nLord Chiltern. This arose partly from a belief that the quarrel was\r\nfinal, and that, therefore, there would be no danger in aggravating\r\nViolet by this expression of pity,--partly from a feeling that it\r\nwould be better that her niece should marry Lord Chiltern than that\r\nshe should not marry at all,--and partly, perhaps, from the general\r\nprinciple that, as she thought it right to scold her niece on all\r\noccasions, this might be best done by taking an opposite view of\r\nall questions to that taken by the niece to be scolded. Violet was\r\nsupposed to regard Lord Chiltern as having sinned against her, and\r\ntherefore Lady Baldock talked of "poor Lord Chiltern." As to the\r\nother lovers, she had begun to perceive that their conditions were\r\nhopeless. Her daughter Augusta had explained to her that there was\r\nno chance remaining either for Phineas, or for Lord Fawn, or for Mr.\r\nAppledom. "I believe she will be an old maid, on purpose to bring me\r\nto my grave," said Lady Baldock. When, therefore, Lady Baldock was\r\ntold one day that Lord Chiltern was in the house, and was asking to\r\nsee Miss Effingham, she did not at once faint away, and declare that\r\nthey would all be murdered,--as she would have done some months\r\nsince. She was perplexed by a double duty. If it were possible that\r\nViolet should relent and be reconciled, then it would be her duty to\r\nsave Violet from the claws of the wild beast. But if there was no\r\nsuch chance, then it would be her duty to poor Lord Chiltern to see\r\nthat he was not treated with contumely and ill-humour.\r\n\r\n"Does she know that he is here?" Lady Baldock asked her daughter.\r\n\r\n"Not yet, mamma."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, oh dear! I suppose she ought to see him. She has given him\r\nso much encouragement!"\r\n\r\n"I suppose she will do as she pleases, mamma."\r\n\r\n"Augusta, how can you talk in that way? Am I to have no control in my\r\nown house?" It was, however, soon apparent to her that in this matter\r\nshe was to have no control.\r\n\r\n"Lord Chiltern is down-stairs," said Violet, coming into the room\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\n"So Augusta tells me. Sit down, my dear."\r\n\r\n"I cannot sit down, aunt,--not just now. I have sent down to say that\r\nI would be with him in a minute. He is the most impatient soul alive,\r\nand I must not keep him waiting."\r\n\r\n"And you mean to see him?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly I shall see him," said Violet, as she left the room.\r\n\r\n"I wonder that any woman should ever take upon herself the charge of\r\na niece!" said Lady Baldock to her daughter in a despondent tone, as\r\nshe held up her hands in dismay. In the meantime, Violet had gone\r\ndown-stairs with a quick step, and had then boldly entered the room\r\nin which her lover was waiting to receive her.\r\n\r\n"I have to thank you for coming to me, Violet," said Lord Chiltern.\r\nThere was still in his face something of savagery,--an expression\r\npartly of anger and partly of resolution to tame the thing with which\r\nhe was angry. Violet did not regard the anger half so keenly as she\r\ndid that resolution of taming. An angry lord, she thought, she could\r\nendure, but she could not bear the idea of being tamed by any one.\r\n\r\n"Why should I not come?" she said. "Of course I came when I was told\r\nthat you were here. I do not think that there need be a quarrel\r\nbetween us, because we have changed our minds."\r\n\r\n"Such changes make quarrels," said he.\r\n\r\n"It shall not do so with me, unless you choose that it shall," said\r\nViolet. "Why should we be enemies,--we who have known each other\r\nsince we were children? My dearest friends are your father and your\r\nsister. Why should we be enemies?"\r\n\r\n"I have come to ask you whether you think that I have ill-used you?"\r\n\r\n"Ill-used me! Certainly not. Has any one told you that I have accused\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"No one has told me so."\r\n\r\n"Then why do you ask me?"\r\n\r\n"Because I would not have you think so,--if I could help it. I did\r\nnot intend to be rough with you. When you told me that my life was\r\ndisreputable--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Oswald, do not let us go back to that. What good will it do?"\r\n\r\n"But you said so."\r\n\r\n"I think not."\r\n\r\n"I believe that that was your word,--the harshest word that you could\r\nuse in all the language."\r\n\r\n"I did not mean to be harsh. If I used it, I will beg your pardon.\r\nOnly let there be an end of it. As we think so differently about life\r\nin general, it was better that we should not be married. But that\r\nis settled, and why should we go back to words that were spoken in\r\nhaste, and which are simply disagreeable?"\r\n\r\n"I have come to know whether it is settled."\r\n\r\n"Certainly. You settled it yourself, Oswald. I told you what I\r\nthought myself bound to tell you. Perhaps I used language which I\r\nshould not have used. Then you told me that I could not be your\r\nwife;--and I thought you were right, quite right."\r\n\r\n"I was wrong, quite wrong," he said impetuously. "So wrong, that I\r\ncan never forgive myself, if you do not relent. I was such a fool,\r\nthat I cannot forgive myself my folly. I had known before that I\r\ncould not live without you; and when you were mine, I threw you away\r\nfor an angry word."\r\n\r\n"It was not an angry word," she said.\r\n\r\n"Say it again, and let me have another chance to answer it."\r\n\r\n"I think I said that idleness was not,--respectable, or something\r\nlike that, taken out of a copy-book probably. But you are a man who\r\ndo not like rebukes, even out of copy-books. A man so thin-skinned\r\nas you are must choose for himself a wife with a softer tongue than\r\nmine."\r\n\r\n"I will choose none other!" he said. But still he was savage in his\r\ntone and in his gestures. "I made my choice long since, as you know\r\nwell enough. I do not change easily. I cannot change in this. Violet,\r\nsay that you will be my wife once more, and I will swear to work for\r\nyou like a coal-heaver."\r\n\r\n"My wish is that my husband,--should I ever have one,--should work,\r\nnot exactly as a coal-heaver."\r\n\r\n"Come, Violet," he said,--and now the look of savagery departed from\r\nhim, and there came a smile over his face, which, however, had in it\r\nmore of sadness than of hope or joy,--"treat me fairly,--or rather,\r\ntreat me generously if you can. I do not know whether you ever loved\r\nme much."\r\n\r\n"Very much,--years ago, when you were a boy."\r\n\r\n"But not since? If it be so, I had better go. Love on one side only\r\nis a poor affair at best."\r\n\r\n"A very poor affair."\r\n\r\n"It is better to bear anything than to try and make out life with\r\nthat. Some of you women never want to love any one."\r\n\r\n"That was what I was saying of myself to Laura but the other day.\r\nWith some women it is so easy. With others it is so difficult, that\r\nperhaps it never comes to them."\r\n\r\n"And with you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, with me--. But it is better in these matters to confine\r\noneself to generalities. If you please, I will not describe myself\r\npersonally. Were I to do so, doubtless I should do it falsely."\r\n\r\n"You love no one else, Violet?"\r\n\r\n"That is my affair, my lord."\r\n\r\n"By heavens, and it is mine too. Tell me that you do, and I will\r\ngo away and leave you at once. I will not ask his name, and I will\r\ntrouble you no more. If it is not so, and if it is possible that you\r\nshould forgive me--"\r\n\r\n"Forgive you! When have I been angry with you?"\r\n\r\n"Answer me my question, Violet."\r\n\r\n"I will not answer you your question,--not that one."\r\n\r\n"What question will you answer?"\r\n\r\n"Any that may concern yourself and myself. None that may concern\r\nother people."\r\n\r\n"You told me once that you loved me."\r\n\r\n"This moment I told you that I did so,--years ago."\r\n\r\n"But now?"\r\n\r\n"That is another matter."\r\n\r\n"Violet, do you love me now?"\r\n\r\n"That is a point-blank question at any rate," she said.\r\n\r\n"And you will answer it?"\r\n\r\n"I must answer it,--I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Well, then?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Oswald, what a fool you are! Love you! of course I love you.\r\nIf you can understand anything, you ought to know that I have never\r\nloved any one else;--that after what has passed between us, I never\r\nshall love any one else. I do love you. There. Whether you throw me\r\naway from you, as you did the other day,--with great scorn, mind\r\nyou,--or come to me with sweet, beautiful promises, as you do now, I\r\nshall love you all the same. I cannot be your wife, if you will not\r\nhave me; can I? When you run away in your tantrums because I quote\r\nsomething out of the copy-book, I can\'t run after you. It would not\r\nbe pretty. But as for loving you, if you doubt that, I tell you, you\r\nare a--fool." As she spoke the last words she pouted out her lips at\r\nhim, and when he looked into her face he saw that her eyes were full\r\nof tears. He was standing now with his arm round her waist, so that\r\nit was not easy for him to look into her face.\r\n\r\n"I am a fool," he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--you are; but I don\'t love you the less on that account."\r\n\r\n"I will never doubt it again."\r\n\r\n"No;--do not; and, for me, I will not say another word, whether you\r\nchoose to heave coals or not. You shall do as you please. I meant to\r\nbe very wise;--I did indeed."\r\n\r\n"You are the grandest girl that ever was made."\r\n\r\n"I do not want to be grand at all, and I never will be wise any more.\r\nOnly do not frown at me and look savage." Then she put up her hand\r\nto smooth his brow. "I am half afraid of you still, you know. There.\r\nThat will do. Now let me go, that I may tell my aunt. During the last\r\ntwo months she has been full of pity for poor Lord Chiltern."\r\n\r\n"It has been poor Lord Chiltern with a vengeance!" said he.\r\n\r\n"But now that we have made it up, she will be horrified again at all\r\nyour wickednesses. You have been a turtle dove lately;--now you will\r\nbe an ogre again. But, Oswald, you must not be an ogre to me."\r\n\r\nAs soon as she could get quit of her lover, she did tell her tale to\r\nLady Baldock. "You have accepted him again!" said her aunt, holding\r\nup her hands. "Yes,--I have accepted him again," replied Violet.\r\n"Then the responsibility must be on your own shoulders," said her\r\naunt; "I wash my hands of it." That evening, when she discussed the\r\nmatter with her daughter, Lady Baldock spoke of Violet and Lord\r\nChiltern, as though their intended marriage were the one thing in the\r\nworld which she most deplored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIV\r\n\r\nThe Beginning of the End\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day of the debate had come, and Phineas Finn was still sitting in\r\nhis room at the Colonial Office. But his resignation had been sent in\r\nand accepted, and he was simply awaiting the coming of his successor.\r\nAbout noon his successor came, and he had the gratification of\r\nresigning his arm-chair to Mr. Bonteen. It is generally understood\r\nthat gentlemen leaving offices give up either seals or a portfolio.\r\nPhineas had been put in possession of no seal and no portfolio; but\r\nthere was in the room which he had occupied a special arm-chair, and\r\nthis with much regret he surrendered to the use and comfort of Mr.\r\nBonteen. There was a glance of triumph in his enemy\'s eyes, and an\r\nexultation in the tone of his enemy\'s voice, which were very bitter\r\nto him. "So you are really going?" said Mr. Bonteen. "Well; I dare\r\nsay it is all very proper. I don\'t quite understand the thing myself,\r\nbut I have no doubt you are right." "It isn\'t easy to understand; is\r\nit?" said Phineas, trying to laugh. But Mr. Bonteen did not feel the\r\nintended satire, and poor Phineas found it useless to attempt to\r\npunish the man he hated. He left him as quickly as he could, and went\r\nto say a few words of farewell to his late chief.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Finn," said Lord Cantrip. "It is a great trouble to me\r\nthat we should have to part in this way."\r\n\r\n"And to me also, my lord. I wish it could have been avoided."\r\n\r\n"You should not have gone to Ireland with so dangerous a man as Mr.\r\nMonk. But it is too late to think of that now."\r\n\r\n"The milk is spilt; is it not?"\r\n\r\n"But these terrible rendings asunder never last very long," said\r\nLord Cantrip, "unless a man changes his opinions altogether. How\r\nmany quarrels and how many reconciliations we have lived to see! I\r\nremember when Gresham went out of office, because he could not sit\r\nin the same room with Mr. Mildmay, and yet they became the fastest\r\nof political friends. There was a time when Plinlimmon and the Duke\r\ncould not stable their horses together at all; and don\'t you remember\r\nwhen Palliser was obliged to give up his hopes of office because he\r\nhad some bee in his bonnet?" I think, however, that the bee in Mr.\r\nPalliser\'s bonnet to which Lord Cantrip was alluding made its buzzing\r\naudible on some subject that was not exactly political. "We shall\r\nhave you back again before long, I don\'t doubt. Men who can really do\r\ntheir work are too rare to be left long in the comfort of the benches\r\nbelow the gangway." This was very kindly said, and Phineas was\r\nflattered and comforted. He could not, however, make Lord Cantrip\r\nunderstand the whole truth. For him the dream of a life of politics\r\nwas over for ever. He had tried it, and had succeeded beyond his\r\nutmost hopes; but, in spite of his success, the ground had crumbled\r\nto pieces beneath his feet, and he knew that he could never recover\r\nthe niche in the world\'s gallery which he was now leaving.\r\n\r\nThat same afternoon he met Mr. Gresham in one of the passages leading\r\nto the House, and the Prime Minister put his arm through that of our\r\nhero as they walked together into the lobby. "I am sorry that we are\r\nlosing you," said Mr. Gresham.\r\n\r\n"You may be sure that I am sorry to be so lost," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"These things will occur in political life," said the leader; "but\r\nI think that they seldom leave rancour behind them when the purpose\r\nis declared, and when the subject of disagreement is marked and\r\nunderstood. The defalcation which creates angry feeling is that which\r\nhas to be endured without previous warning,--when a man votes against\r\nhis party,--or a set of men, from private pique or from some cause\r\nwhich is never clear." Phineas, when he heard this, knew well how\r\nterribly this very man had been harassed, and driven nearly wild,\r\nby defalcation, exactly of that nature which he was attempting to\r\ndescribe. "No doubt you and Mr. Monk think you are right," continued\r\nMr. Gresham.\r\n\r\n"We have given strong evidence that we think so," said Phineas. "We\r\ngive up our places, and we are, both of us, very poor men."\r\n\r\n"I think you are wrong, you know, not so much in your views on the\r\nquestion itself--which, to tell the truth, I hardly understand as\r\nyet."\r\n\r\n"We will endeavour to explain them."\r\n\r\n"And will do so very clearly, no doubt. But I think that Mr. Monk was\r\nwrong in desiring, as a member of a Government, to force a measure\r\nwhich, whether good or bad, the Government as a body does not desire\r\nto initiate,--at any rate, just now."\r\n\r\n"And therefore he resigned," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Of course. But it seems to me that he failed to comprehend the only\r\nway in which a great party can act together, if it is to do any\r\nservice in this country. Don\'t for a moment think that I am blaming\r\nhim or you."\r\n\r\n"I am nobody in this matter," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"I can assure you, Mr. Finn, that we have not regarded you in that\r\nlight, and I hope that the time may come when we may be sitting\r\ntogether again on the same bench."\r\n\r\nNeither on the Treasury bench nor on any other in that House was\r\nhe to sit again after this fashion! That was the trouble which was\r\ncrushing his spirit at this moment, and not the loss of his office!\r\nHe knew that he could not venture to think of remaining in London\r\nas a member of Parliament with no other income than that which his\r\nfather could allow him, even if he could again secure a seat in\r\nParliament. When he had first been returned for Loughshane he had\r\nassured his friends that his duty as a member of the House of Commons\r\nwould not be a bar to his practice in the Courts. He had now been\r\nfive years a member, and had never once made an attempt at doing any\r\npart of a barrister\'s work. He had gone altogether into a different\r\nline of life, and had been most successful;--so successful that men\r\ntold him, and women more frequently than men, that his career had\r\nbeen a miracle of success. But there had been, as he had well known\r\nfrom the first, this drawback in the new profession which he had\r\nchosen, that nothing in it could be permanent. They who succeed in\r\nit, may probably succeed again; but then the success is intermittent,\r\nand there may be years of hard work in opposition, to which,\r\nunfortunately, no pay is assigned. It is almost imperative, as he now\r\nfound, that they who devote themselves to such a profession should\r\nbe men of fortune. When he had commenced his work,--at the period of\r\nhis first return for Loughshane,--he had had no thought of mending\r\nhis deficiency in this respect by a rich marriage. Nor had it ever\r\noccurred to him that he would seek a marriage for that purpose. Such\r\nan idea would have been thoroughly distasteful to him. There had been\r\nno stain of premeditated mercenary arrangement upon him at any time.\r\nBut circumstances had so fallen out with him, that as he won his\r\nspurs in Parliament, as he became known, and was placed first in one\r\noffice and then in another, prospects of love and money together were\r\nopened to him, and he ventured on, leaving Mr. Low and the law behind\r\nhim,--because these prospects were so alluring. Then had come Mr.\r\nMonk and Mary Flood Jones,--and everything around him had collapsed.\r\n\r\nEverything around him had collapsed,--with, however, a terrible\r\ntemptation to him to inflate his sails again, at the cost of his\r\ntruth and his honour. The temptation would have affected him\r\nnot at all, had Madame Goesler been ugly, stupid, or personally\r\ndisagreeable. But she was, he thought, the most beautiful woman\r\nhe had ever seen, the most witty, and in many respects the most\r\ncharming. She had offered to give him everything that she had, so to\r\nplace him in the world that opposition would be more pleasant to him\r\nthan office, to supply every want, and had done so in a manner that\r\nhad gratified all his vanity. But he had refused it all, because he\r\nwas bound to the girl at Floodborough. My readers will probably say\r\nthat he was not a true man unless he could do this without a regret.\r\nWhen Phineas thought of it all, there were many regrets.\r\n\r\nBut there was at the same time a resolve on his part, that if any man\r\nhad ever loved the girl he promised to love, he would love Mary Flood\r\nJones. A thousand times he had told himself that she had not the\r\nspirit of Lady Laura, or the bright wit of Violet Effingham, or the\r\nbeauty of Madame Goesler. But Mary had charms of her own that were\r\nmore valuable than them all. Was there one among the three who had\r\ntrusted him as she trusted him,--or loved him with the same satisfied\r\ndevotion? There were regrets, regrets that were heavy on his\r\nheart;--for London, and Parliament, and the clubs, and Downing\r\nStreet, had become dear to him. He liked to think of himself as he\r\nrode in the park, and was greeted by all those whose greeting was\r\nthe most worth having. There were regrets,--sad regrets. But the\r\ngirl whom he loved better than the parks and the clubs,--better even\r\nthan Westminster and Downing Street, should never know that they had\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts were running through his mind even while he was\r\nlistening to Mr. Monk, as he propounded his theory of doing justice\r\nto Ireland. This might probably be the last great debate in which\r\nPhineas would be able to take a part, and he was determined that he\r\nwould do his best in it. He did not intend to speak on this day, if,\r\nas was generally supposed, the House would be adjourned before a\r\ndivision could be obtained. But he would remain on the alert and see\r\nhow the thing went. He had come to understand the forms of the place,\r\nand was as well-trained a young member of Parliament as any there. He\r\nhad been quick at learning a lesson that is not easily learned, and\r\nknew how things were going, and what were the proper moments for this\r\nquestion or that form of motion. He could anticipate a count-out,\r\nunderstood the tone of men\'s minds, and could read the gestures of\r\nthe House. It was very little likely that the debate should be over\r\nto-night. He knew that; and as the present time was the evening of\r\nTuesday, he resolved at once that he would speak as early as he could\r\non the following Thursday. What a pity it was, that with one who had\r\nlearned so much, all his learning should be in vain!\r\n\r\nAt about two o\'clock, he himself succeeded in moving the adjournment\r\nof the debate. This he did from a seat below the gangway, to which he\r\nhad removed himself from the Treasury bench. Then the House was up,\r\nand he walked home with Mr. Monk. Mr. Monk, since he had been told\r\npositively by Phineas that he had resolved upon resigning his office,\r\nhad said nothing more of his sorrow at his friend\'s resolve, but had\r\nused him as one political friend uses another, telling him all his\r\nthoughts and all his hopes as to this new measure of his, and taking\r\ncounsel with him as to the way in which the fight should be fought.\r\nTogether they had counted over the list of members, marking these\r\nmen as supporters, those as opponents, and another set, now more\r\nimportant than either, as being doubtful. From day to day those who\r\nhad been written down as doubtful were struck off that third list,\r\nand put in either the one or the other of those who were either\r\nsupporters or opponents. And their different modes of argument were\r\nsettled between these two allied orators, how one should take this\r\nline and the other that. To Mr. Monk this was very pleasant. He was\r\nquite assured now that opposition was more congenial to his spirit,\r\nand more fitting for him than office. There was no doubt to him as\r\nto his future sitting in Parliament, let the result of this contest\r\nbe what it might. The work which he was now doing, was the work for\r\nwhich he had been training himself all his life. While he had been\r\nforced to attend Cabinet Councils from week to week, he had been\r\ndepressed. Now he was exultant. Phineas seeing and understanding all\r\nthis, said but little to his friend of his own prospects. As long as\r\nthis pleasant battle was raging, he could fight in it shoulder to\r\nshoulder with the man he loved. After that there would be a blank.\r\n\r\n"I do not see how we are to fail to have a majority after Daubeny\'s\r\nspeech to-night," said Mr. Monk, as they walked together down\r\nParliament Street through the bright moonlight.\r\n\r\n"He expressly said that he only spoke for himself," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"But we know what that means. He is bidding for office, and of course\r\nthose who want office with him will vote as he votes. We have already\r\ncounted those who would go into office, but they will not carry the\r\nwhole party."\r\n\r\n"It will carry enough of them."\r\n\r\n"There are forty or fifty men on his side of the House, and as many\r\nperhaps on ours," said Mr. Monk, "who have no idea of any kind on\r\nany bill, and who simply follow the bell, whether into this lobby\r\nor that. Argument never touches them. They do not even look to the\r\nresult of a division on their own interests, as the making of any\r\ncalculation would be laborious to them. Their party leader is to them\r\na Pope whom they do not dream of doubting. I never can quite make up\r\nmy mind whether it is good or bad that there should be such men in\r\nParliament."\r\n\r\n"Men who think much want to speak often," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Exactly so,--and of speaking members, God knows that we have enough.\r\nAnd I suppose that these purblind sheep do have some occult weight\r\nthat is salutary. They enable a leader to be a leader, and even in\r\nthat way they are useful. We shall get a division on Thursday."\r\n\r\n"I understand that Gresham has consented to that."\r\n\r\n"So Ratler told me. Palliser is to speak, and Barrington Erle. And\r\nthey say that Robson is going to make an onslaught specially on me.\r\nWe shall get it over by one o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"And if we beat them?" asked Phineas.\r\n\r\n"It will depend on the numbers. Everybody who has spoken to me about\r\nit, seems to think that they will dissolve if there be a respectable\r\nmajority against them."\r\n\r\n"Of course he will dissolve," said Phineas, speaking of Mr. Gresham;\r\n"what else can he do?"\r\n\r\n"He is very anxious to carry his Irish Reform Bill first, if he can\r\ndo so. Good-night, Phineas. I shall not be down to-morrow as there\r\nis nothing to be done. Come to me on Thursday, and we will go to the\r\nHouse together."\r\n\r\nOn the Wednesday Phineas was engaged to dine with Mr. Low. There\r\nwas a dinner party in Bedford Square, and Phineas met half-a-dozen\r\nbarristers and their wives,--men to whom he had looked up as\r\nsuccessful pundits in the law some five or six years ago, but who\r\nsince that time had almost learned to look up to him. And now they\r\ntreated him with that courteousness of manner which success in life\r\nalways begets. There was a judge there who was very civil to him; and\r\nthe judge\'s wife whom he had taken down to dinner was very gracious\r\nto him. The judge had got his prize in life, and was therefore\r\npersonally indifferent to the fate of ministers; but the judge\'s wife\r\nhad a brother who wanted a County Court from Lord De Terrier, and it\r\nwas known that Phineas was giving valuable assistance towards the\r\nattainment of this object. "I do think that you and Mr. Monk are so\r\nright," said the judge\'s wife. Phineas, who understood how it came to\r\npass that the judge\'s wife should so cordially approve his conduct,\r\ncould not help thinking how grand a thing it would be for him to have\r\na County Court for himself.\r\n\r\nWhen the guests were gone he was left alone with Mr. and Mrs. Low,\r\nand remained awhile with them, there having been an understanding\r\nthat they should have a last chat together over the affairs of our\r\nhero. "Do you really mean that you will not stand again?" asked Mrs.\r\nLow.\r\n\r\n"I do mean it. I may say that I cannot do so. My father is hardly\r\nso well able to help me as he was when I began this game, and I\r\ncertainly shall not ask him for money to support a canvass."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a thousand pities," said Mrs. Low.\r\n\r\n"I really had begun to think that you would make it answer," said Mr.\r\nLow.\r\n\r\n"In one way I have made it answer. For the last three years I have\r\nlived upon what I have earned, and I am not in debt. But now I must\r\nbegin the world again. I am afraid I shall find the drudgery very\r\nhard."\r\n\r\n"It is hard no doubt," said the barrister, who had gone through it\r\nall, and was now reaping the fruits of it. "But I suppose you have\r\nnot forgotten what you learned?"\r\n\r\n"Who can say? I dare say I have. But I did not mean the drudgery\r\nof learning, so much as the drudgery of looking after work;--of\r\nexpecting briefs which perhaps will never come. I am thirty years old\r\nnow, you know."\r\n\r\n"Are you indeed?" said Mrs. Low,--who knew his age to a day. "How the\r\ntime passes. I\'m sure I hope you\'ll get on, Mr. Finn. I do indeed."\r\n\r\n"I am sure he will, if he puts his shoulder to it," said Mr. Low.\r\n\r\nNeither the lawyer nor his wife repeated any of those sententious\r\nadmonitions, which had almost become rebukes, and which had been\r\nso common in their mouths. The fall with which they had threatened\r\nPhineas Finn had come upon him, and they were too generous to remind\r\nhim of their wisdom and sagacity. Indeed, when he got up to take his\r\nleave, Mrs. Low, who probably might not see him again for years, was\r\nquite affectionate in her manners to him, and looked as if she were\r\nalmost minded to kiss him as she pressed his hand. "We will come and\r\nsee you," she said, "when you are Master of the Rolls in Dublin."\r\n\r\n"We shall see him before then thundering at us poor Tories in the\r\nHouse," said Mr. Low. "He will be back again sooner or later." And\r\nso they parted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXV\r\n\r\nP. P. C.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Thursday morning before Phineas went to Mr. Monk, a gentleman\r\ncalled upon him at his lodgings. Phineas requested the servant to\r\nbring up the gentleman\'s name, but tempted perhaps by a shilling the\r\ngirl brought up the gentleman instead. It was Mr. Quintus Slide from\r\nthe office of the "Banner of the People."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Finn," said Quintus, with his hand extended, "I have come to\r\noffer you the calumet of peace." Phineas certainly desired no such\r\ncalumet. But to refuse a man\'s hand is to declare active war after a\r\nfashion which men do not like to adopt except on deliberation. He had\r\nnever cared a straw for the abuse which Mr. Slide had poured upon\r\nhim, and now he gave his hand to the man of letters. But he did not\r\nsit down, nor did he offer a seat to Mr. Slide. "I know that as a man\r\nof sense who knows the world, you will accept the calumet of peace,"\r\ncontinued Mr. Slide.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why I should be asked particularly to accept war or\r\npeace," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Finn,--I don\'t often quote the Bible; but those who are\r\nnot for us must be against us. You will agree to that. Now that\r\nyou\'ve freed yourself from the iniquities of that sink of abomination\r\nin Downing Street, I look upon you as a man again."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word you are very kind."\r\n\r\n"As a man and also a brother. I suppose you know that I\'ve got the\r\n_Banner_ into my own \'ands now." Phineas was obliged to explain that\r\nhe had not hitherto been made acquainted with this great literary\r\nand political secret. "Oh dear, yes, altogether so. We\'ve got rid of\r\nold Rusty as I used to call him. He wouldn\'t go the pace, and so we\r\nstripped him. He\'s doing the _West of England Art Journal_ now, and\r\nhe \'angs out down at Bristol."\r\n\r\n"I hope he\'ll succeed, Mr. Slide."\r\n\r\n"He\'ll earn his wages. He\'s a man who will always earn his wages, but\r\nnothing more. Well, now, Mr. Finn, I will just offer you one word of\r\napology for our little severities."\r\n\r\n"Pray do nothing of the kind."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I shall. Dooty is dooty. There was some things printed which\r\nwere a little rough, but if one isn\'t a little rough there ain\'t no\r\nflavour. Of course I wrote \'em. You know my \'and, I dare say."\r\n\r\n"I only remember that there was some throwing of mud."\r\n\r\n"Just so. But mud don\'t break any bones; does it? When you turned\r\nagainst us I had to be down on you, and I was down upon you;--that\'s\r\njust about all of it. Now you\'re coming among us again, and so I come\r\nto you with a calumet of peace."\r\n\r\n"But I am not coming among you."\r\n\r\n"Yes you are, Finn, and bringing Monk with you." It was now becoming\r\nvery disagreeable, and Phineas was beginning to perceive that it\r\nwould soon be his turn to say something rough. "Now I\'ll tell you\r\nwhat my proposition is. If you\'ll do us two leaders a week through\r\nthe session, you shall have a cheque for L16 on the last day of every\r\nmonth. If that\'s not honester money than what you got in Downing\r\nStreet, my name is not Quintus Slide."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Slide," said Phineas,--and then he paused.\r\n\r\n"If we are to come to business, drop the Mister. It makes things go\r\nso much easier."\r\n\r\n"We are not to come to business, and I do not want things to go easy.\r\nI believe you said some things of me in your newspaper that were very\r\nscurrilous."\r\n\r\n"What of that? If you mind that sort of thing--"\r\n\r\n"I did not regard it in the least. You are quite welcome to continue\r\nit. I don\'t doubt but you will continue it. But you are not welcome\r\nto come here afterwards."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to turn me out?"\r\n\r\n"Just that. You printed a heap of lies--"\r\n\r\n"Lies, Mr. Finn! Did you say lies, sir?"\r\n\r\n"I said lies;--lies;--lies!" And Phineas walked over at him as though\r\nhe were going to pitch him instantly out of the window. "You may go\r\nand write as many more as you like. It is your trade, and you must do\r\nit or starve. But do not come to me again." Then he opened the door\r\nand stood with it in his hand.\r\n\r\n"Very well, sir. I shall know how to punish this."\r\n\r\n"Exactly. But if you please you\'ll go and do your punishment at the\r\noffice of the _Banner_,--unless you like to try it here. You want to\r\nkick me and spit at me, but you will prefer to do it in print."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said Quintus Slide. "I shall prefer to do it in\r\nprint,--though I must own that the temptation to adopt the manual\r\nviolence of a ruffian is great, very great, very great indeed." But\r\nhe resisted the temptation and walked down the stairs, concocting his\r\narticle as he went.\r\n\r\nMr. Quintus Slide did not so much impede the business of his day but\r\nwhat Phineas was with Mr. Monk by two, and in his place in the House\r\nwhen prayers were read at four. As he sat in his place, conscious\r\nof the work that was before him, listening to the presentation of\r\npetitions, and to the formal reading of certain notices of motions,\r\nwhich with the asking of sundry questions occupied over half an\r\nhour, he looked back and remembered accurately his own feelings on\r\na certain night on which he had intended to get up and address the\r\nHouse. The ordeal before him had then been so terrible, that it had\r\nalmost obliterated for the moment his senses of hearing and of sight.\r\nHe had hardly been able to perceive what had been going on around\r\nhim, and had vainly endeavoured to occupy himself in recalling to\r\nhis memory the words which he wished to pronounce. When the time for\r\npronouncing them had come, he had found himself unable to stand upon\r\nhis legs. He smiled as he recalled all this in his memory, waiting\r\nimpatiently for the moment in which he might rise. His audience was\r\nassured to him now, and he did not fear it. His opportunity for\r\nutterance was his own, and even the Speaker could not deprive him of\r\nit. During these minutes he thought not at all of the words that he\r\nwas to say. He had prepared his matter but had prepared no words. He\r\nknew that words would come readily enough to him, and that he had\r\nlearned the task of turning his thoughts quickly into language while\r\nstanding with a crowd of listeners around him,--as a practised writer\r\ndoes when seated in his chair. There was no violent beating at his\r\nheart now, no dimness of the eyes, no feeling that the ground was\r\nturning round under his feet. If only those weary vain questions\r\nwould get themselves all asked, so that he might rise and begin the\r\nwork of the night. Then there came the last thought as the House was\r\nhushed for his rising. What was the good of it all, when he would\r\nnever have an opportunity of speaking there again?\r\n\r\nBut not on that account would he be slack in his endeavour now.\r\nHe would be listened to once at least, not as a subaltern of the\r\nGovernment but as the owner of a voice prominent in opposition to\r\nthe Government. He had been taught by Mr. Monk that that was the one\r\nplace in the House in which a man with a power of speaking could\r\nreally enjoy pleasure without alloy. He would make the trial,--once,\r\nif never again. Things had so gone with him that the rostrum was his\r\nown, and a House crammed to overflowing was there to listen to him.\r\nHe had given up his place in order that he might be able to speak his\r\nmind, and had become aware that many intended to listen to him while\r\nhe spoke. He had observed that the rows of strangers were thick in\r\nthe galleries, that peers were standing in the passages, and that\r\nover the reporter\'s head, the ribbons of many ladies were to be seen\r\nthrough the bars of their cage. Yes;--for this once he would have an\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nHe spoke for about an hour, and while he was speaking he knew nothing\r\nabout himself, whether he was doing it well or ill. Something of\r\nhimself he did say soon after he had commenced,--not quite beginning\r\nwith it, as though his mind had been laden with the matter. He had,\r\nhe said, found himself compelled to renounce his happy allegiance to\r\nthe First Lord of the Treasury, and to quit the pleasant company in\r\nwhich, humble as had been his place, he had been allowed to sit and\r\nact, by his unfortunate conviction in this great subject. He had been\r\ntold, he said, that it was a misfortune in itself for one so young as\r\nhe to have convictions. But his Irish birth and Irish connection had\r\nbrought this misfortune of his country so closely home to him that he\r\nhad found the task of extricating himself from it to be impossible.\r\nOf what further he said, speaking on that terribly unintelligible\r\nsubject, a tenant-right proposed for Irish farmers, no English reader\r\nwill desire to know much. Irish subjects in the House of Commons\r\nare interesting or are dull, are debated before a crowded audience\r\ncomposed of all who are leaders in the great world of London, or\r\nbefore empty benches, in accordance with the importance of the moment\r\nand the character of the debate. For us now it is enough to know that\r\nto our hero was accorded that attention which orators love,--which\r\nwill almost make an orator if it can be assured. A full House with a\r\npromise of big type on the next morning would wake to eloquence the\r\npropounder of a Canadian grievance, or the mover of an Indian budget.\r\n\r\nPhineas did not stir out of the House till the division was over,\r\nhaving agreed with Mr. Monk that they two would remain through it\r\nall and hear everything that was to be said. Mr. Gresham had already\r\nspoken, and to Mr. Palliser was confided the task of winding up\r\nthe argument for the Government. Mr. Robson spoke also, greatly\r\nenlivening the tedium of the evening, and to Mr. Monk was permitted\r\nthe privilege of a final reply. At two o\'clock the division came, and\r\nthe Ministry were beaten by a majority of twenty-three. "And now,"\r\nsaid Mr. Monk, as he again walked home with Phineas, "the pity is\r\nthat we are not a bit nearer tenant-right than we were before."\r\n\r\n"But we are nearer to it."\r\n\r\n"In one sense, yes. Such a debate and such a majority will make men\r\nthink. But no;--think is too high a word; as a rule men don\'t think.\r\nBut it will make them believe that there is something in it. Many who\r\nbefore regarded legislation on the subject as chimerical, will now\r\nfancy that it is only dangerous, or perhaps not more than difficult.\r\nAnd so in time it will come to be looked on as among the things\r\npossible, then among the things probable;--and so at last it will be\r\nranged in the list of those few measures which the country requires\r\nas being absolutely needed. That is the way in which public opinion\r\nis made."\r\n\r\n"It is no loss of time," said Phineas, "to have taken the first great\r\nstep in making it."\r\n\r\n"The first great step was taken long ago," said Mr. Monk,--"taken\r\nby men who were looked upon as revolutionary demagogues, almost as\r\ntraitors, because they took it. But it is a great thing to take any\r\nstep that leads us onwards."\r\n\r\nTwo days after this Mr. Gresham declared his intention of dissolving\r\nthe House because of the adverse division which had been produced by\r\nMr. Monk\'s motion, but expressed a wish to be allowed to carry an\r\nIrish Reform Bill through Parliament before he did so. He explained\r\nhow expedient this would be, but declared at the same time that if\r\nany strong opposition were made, he would abandon the project. His\r\nintention simply was to pass with regard to Ireland a measure which\r\nmust be passed soon, and which ought to be passed before a new\r\nelection took place. The bill was ready, and should be read for the\r\nfirst time on the next night, if the House were willing. The House\r\nwas willing, though there were very many recalcitrant Irish members.\r\nThe Irish members made loud opposition, and then twitted Mr. Gresham\r\nwith his promise that he would not go on with his bill, if opposition\r\nwere made. But, nevertheless, he did go on, and the measure was\r\nhurried through the two Houses in a week. Our hero who still sat for\r\nLoughshane, but who was never to sit for Loughshane again, gave what\r\nassistance he could to the Government, and voted for the measure\r\nwhich deprived Loughshane for ever of its parliamentary honours.\r\n\r\n"And very dirty conduct I think it was," said Lord Tulla, when he\r\ndiscussed the subject with his agent. "After being put in for the\r\nborough twice, almost free of expense, it was very dirty." It never\r\noccurred to Lord Tulla that a member of Parliament might feel himself\r\nobliged to vote on such a subject in accordance with his judgment.\r\n\r\nThis Irish Reform Bill was scrambled through the two Houses, and\r\nthen the session was over. The session was over, and they who knew\r\nanything of the private concerns of Mr. Phineas Finn were aware that\r\nhe was about to return to Ireland, and did not intend to reappear on\r\nthe scene which had known him so well for the last five years. "I\r\ncannot tell you how sad it makes me," said Mr. Monk.\r\n\r\n"And it makes me sad too," said Phineas. "I try to shake off the\r\nmelancholy, and tell myself from day to day that it is unmanly. But\r\nit gets the better of me just at present."\r\n\r\n"I feel quite certain that you will come back among us again," said\r\nMr. Monk.\r\n\r\n"Everybody tells me so; and yet I feel quite certain that I shall\r\nnever come back,--never come back with a seat in Parliament. As my\r\nold tutor, Low, has told me scores of times, I began at the wrong\r\nend. Here I am, thirty years of age, and I have not a shilling in the\r\nworld, and I do not know how to earn one."\r\n\r\n"Only for me you would still be receiving ever so much a year, and\r\nall would be pleasant," said Mr. Monk.\r\n\r\n"But how long would it have lasted? The first moment that Daubeny got\r\nthe upper hand I should have fallen lower than I have fallen now. If\r\nnot this year, it would have been the next. My only comfort is in\r\nthis,--that I have done the thing myself, and have not been turned\r\nout." To the very last, however, Mr. Monk continued to express his\r\nopinion that Phineas would come back, declaring that he had known no\r\ninstance of a young man who had made himself useful in Parliament,\r\nand then had been allowed to leave it in early life.\r\n\r\nAmong those of whom he was bound to take a special leave, the members\r\nof the family of Lord Brentford were, of course, the foremost. He\r\nhad already heard of the reconciliation of Miss Effingham and Lord\r\nChiltern, and was anxious to offer his congratulation to both of\r\nthem. And it was essential to him that he should see Lady Laura. To\r\nher he wrote a line, saying how much he hoped that he should be able\r\nto bid her adieu, and a time was fixed for his coming at which she\r\nknew that she would meet him alone. But, as chance ruled it, he came\r\nupon the two lovers together, and then remembered that he had hardly\r\never before been in the same room with both of them at the same time.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Finn, what a beautiful speech you made. I read every word of\r\nit," said Violet.\r\n\r\n"And I didn\'t even look at it, old fellow," said Chiltern, getting up\r\nand putting his arm on the other\'s shoulder in a way that was common\r\nwith him when he was quite intimate with the friend near him.\r\n\r\n"Laura went down and heard it," said Violet. "I could not do that,\r\nbecause I was tied to my aunt. You can\'t conceive how dutiful I am\r\nduring this last month."\r\n\r\n"And is it to be in a month, Chiltern?" said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"She says so. She arranges everything,--in concert with my father.\r\nWhen I threw up the sponge, I simply asked for a long day. \'A long\r\nday, my lord,\' I said. But my father and Violet between them refused\r\nme any mercy."\r\n\r\n"You do not believe him," said Violet.\r\n\r\n"Not a word. If I did he would want to see me on the coast of\r\nFlanders again, I don\'t doubt. I have come to congratulate you both."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Mr. Finn," said Violet, taking his hand with hearty\r\nkindness. "I should not have been quite happy without one nice word\r\nfrom you."\r\n\r\n"I shall try and make the best of it," said Chiltern. "But, I say,\r\nyou\'ll come over and ride Bonebreaker again. He\'s down there at\r\nthe Bull, and I\'ve taken a little box close by. I can\'t stand the\r\ngovernor\'s county for hunting."\r\n\r\n"And will your wife go down to Willingford?"\r\n\r\n"Of course she will, and ride to hounds a great deal closer than I\r\ncan ever do. Mind you come, and if there\'s anything in the stable fit\r\nto carry you, you shall have it."\r\n\r\nThen Phineas had to explain that he had come to bid them farewell,\r\nand that it was not at all probable that he should ever be able to\r\nsee Willingford again in the hunting season. "I don\'t suppose that I\r\nshall make either of you quite understand it, but I have got to begin\r\nagain. The chances are that I shall never see another foxhound all my\r\nlife."\r\n\r\n"Not in Ireland!" exclaimed Lord Chiltern.\r\n\r\n"Not unless I should have to examine one as a witness. I have nothing\r\nbefore me but downright hard work; and a great deal of that must be\r\ndone before I can hope to earn a shilling."\r\n\r\n"But you are so clever," said Violet. "Of course it will come\r\nquickly."\r\n\r\n"I do not mean to be impatient about it, nor yet unhappy," said\r\nPhineas. "Only hunting won\'t be much in my line."\r\n\r\n"And will you leave London altogether?" Violet asked.\r\n\r\n"Altogether. I shall stick to one club,--Brooks\'s; but I shall take\r\nmy name off all the others."\r\n\r\n"What a deuce of a nuisance!" said Lord Chiltern.\r\n\r\n"I have no doubt you will be very happy," said Violet; "and you\'ll be\r\na Lord Chancellor in no time. But you won\'t go quite yet."\r\n\r\n"Next Sunday."\r\n\r\n"You will return. You must be here for our wedding;--indeed you must.\r\nI will not be married unless you do."\r\n\r\nEven this, however, was impossible. He must go on Sunday, and must\r\nreturn no more. Then he made his little farewell speech, which he\r\ncould not deliver without some awkward stuttering. He would think of\r\nher on the day of her marriage, and pray that she might be happy. And\r\nhe would send her a little trifle before he went, which he hoped she\r\nwould wear in remembrance of their old friendship.\r\n\r\n"She shall wear it, whatever it is, or I\'ll know the reason why,"\r\nsaid Chiltern.\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue, you rough bear!" said Violet. "Of course I\'ll\r\nwear it. And of course I\'ll think of the giver. I shall have many\r\npresents, but few that I will think of so much." Then Phineas left\r\nthe room, with his throat so full that he could not speak another\r\nword.\r\n\r\n"He is still broken-hearted about you," said the favoured lover as\r\nsoon as his rival had left the room.\r\n\r\n"It is not that," said Violet. "He is broken-hearted about\r\neverything. The whole world is vanishing away from him. I wish he\r\ncould have made up his mind to marry that German woman with all the\r\nmoney." It must be understood, however, that Phineas had never spoken\r\na word to any one as to the offer which the German woman had made to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIt was on the morning of the Sunday on which he was to leave London\r\nthat he saw Lady Laura. He had asked that it might be so, in order\r\nthat he might then have nothing more upon his mind. He found her\r\nquite alone, and he could see by her eyes that she had been weeping.\r\nAs he looked at her, remembering that it was not yet six years since\r\nhe had first been allowed to enter that room, he could not but\r\nperceive how very much she was altered in appearance. Then she had\r\nbeen three-and-twenty, and had not looked to be a day older. Now she\r\nmight have been taken to be nearly forty, so much had her troubles\r\npreyed upon her spirit, and eaten into the vitality of her youth. "So\r\nyou have come to say good-bye," she said, smiling as she rose to meet\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Lady Laura;--to say good-bye. Not for ever, I hope, but\r\nprobably for long."\r\n\r\n"No, not for ever. At any rate, we will not think so." Then she\r\npaused; but he was silent, sitting with his hat dangling in his two\r\nhands, and his eyes fixed upon the floor. "Do you know, Mr. Finn,"\r\nshe continued, "that sometimes I am very angry with myself about\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Then it must be because you have been too kind to me."\r\n\r\n"It is because I fear that I have done much to injure you. From\r\nthe first day that I knew you,--do you remember, when we were\r\ntalking here, in this very room, about the beginning of the Reform\r\nBill;--from that day I wished that you should come among us and be\r\none of us."\r\n\r\n"I have been with you, to my infinite satisfaction,--while it\r\nlasted."\r\n\r\n"But it has not lasted, and now I fear that it has done you harm."\r\n\r\n"Who can say whether it has been for good or evil? But of this I am\r\nsure you will be certain,--that I am very grateful to you for all the\r\ngoodness you have shown me." Then again he was silent.\r\n\r\nShe did not know what it was that she wanted, but she did desire some\r\nexpression from his lips that should be warmer than an expression of\r\ngratitude. An expression of love,--of existing love,--she would have\r\nfelt to be an insult, and would have treated it as such. Indeed, she\r\nknew that from him no such insult could come. But she was in that\r\nmorbid, melancholy state of mind which requires the excitement\r\nof more than ordinary sympathy, even though that sympathy be all\r\npainful; and I think that she would have been pleased had he referred\r\nto the passion for herself which he had once expressed. If he would\r\nhave spoken of his love, and of her mistake, and have made some\r\nhalf-suggestion as to what might have been their lives had things\r\ngone differently,--though she would have rebuked him even for\r\nthat,--still it would have comforted her. But at this moment, though\r\nhe remembered much that had passed between them, he was not even\r\nthinking of the Braes of Linter. All that had taken place four years\r\nago;--and there had been so many other things since which had moved\r\nhim even more than that! "You have heard what I have arranged for\r\nmyself?" she said at last.\r\n\r\n"Your father has told me that you are going to Dresden."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--he will accompany me,--coming home of course for Parliament.\r\nIt is a sad break-up, is it not? But the lawyer says that if I remain\r\nhere I may be subject to very disagreeable attempts from Mr. Kennedy\r\nto force me to go back again. It is odd, is it not, that he should\r\nnot understand how impossible it is?"\r\n\r\n"He means to do his duty."\r\n\r\n"I believe so. But he becomes more stern every day to those who are\r\nwith him. And then, why should I remain here? What is there to tempt\r\nme? As a woman separated from her husband I cannot take an interest\r\nin those things which used to charm me. I feel that I am crushed and\r\nquelled by my position, even though there is no disgrace in it."\r\n\r\n"No disgrace, certainly," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"But I am nobody,--or worse than nobody."\r\n\r\n"And I also am going to be a nobody," said Phineas, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Ah; you are a man and will get over it, and you have many years\r\nbefore you will begin to be growing old. I am growing old already.\r\nYes, I am. I feel it, and know it, and see it. A woman has a fine\r\ngame to play; but then she is so easily bowled out, and the term\r\nallowed to her is so short."\r\n\r\n"A man\'s allowance of time may be short too," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"But he can try his hand again." Then there was another pause. "I had\r\nthought, Mr. Finn, that you would have married," she said in her very\r\nlowest voice.\r\n\r\n"You knew all my hopes and fears about that."\r\n\r\n"I mean that you would have married Madame Goesler."\r\n\r\n"What made you think that, Lady Laura?"\r\n\r\n"Because I saw that she liked you, and because such a marriage would\r\nhave been so suitable. She has all that you want. You know what they\r\nsay of her now?"\r\n\r\n"What do they say?"\r\n\r\n"That the Duke of Omnium offered to make her his wife, and that she\r\nrefused him for your sake."\r\n\r\n"There is nothing that people won\'t say;--nothing on earth," said\r\nPhineas. Then he got up and took his leave of her. He also wanted to\r\npart from her with some special expression of affection, but he did\r\nnot know how to choose his words. He had wished that some allusion\r\nshould be made, not to the Braes of Linter, but to the close\r\nconfidence which had so long existed between them; but he found\r\nthat the language to do this properly was wanting to him. Had the\r\nopportunity arisen he would have told her now the whole story of\r\nMary Flood Jones; but the opportunity did not come, and he left her,\r\nnever having mentioned the name of his Mary or having hinted at his\r\nengagement to any one of his friends in London. "It is better so,"\r\nhe said to himself. "My life in Ireland is to be a new life, and why\r\nshould I mix two things together that will be so different?"\r\n\r\nHe was to dine at his lodgings, and then leave them for good at\r\neight o\'clock. He had packed up everything before he went to Portman\r\nSquare, and he returned home only just in time to sit down to his\r\nsolitary mutton chop. But as he sat down he saw a small note\r\naddressed to himself lying on the table among the crowd of books,\r\nletters, and papers, of which he had still to make disposal. It was\r\na very small note in an envelope of a peculiar tint of pink, and he\r\nknew the handwriting well. The blood mounted all over his face as he\r\ntook it up, and he hesitated for a moment before he opened it. It\r\ncould not be that the offer should be repeated to him. Slowly, hardly\r\nventuring at first to look at the enclosure, he opened it, and the\r\nwords which it contained were as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   I learn that you are going to-day, and I write a word\r\n   which you will receive just as you are departing. It is to\r\n   say merely this,--that when I left you the other day I was\r\n   angry, not with you, but with myself. Let me wish you all\r\n   good wishes and that prosperity which I know you will\r\n   deserve, and which I think you will win.\r\n\r\n   Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n   M. M. G.\r\n\r\n   Sunday morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nShould he put off his journey and go to her this very evening and\r\nclaim her as his friend? The question was asked and answered in a\r\nmoment. Of course he would not go to her. Were he to do so there\r\nwould be only one possible word for him to say, and that word should\r\ncertainly never be spoken. But he wrote to her a reply, shorter even\r\nthan her own short note.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Thanks, dear friend. I do not doubt but that you and I\r\n   understand each other thoroughly, and that each trusts the\r\n   other for good wishes and honest intentions.\r\n\r\n   Always yours,\r\n\r\n   P. F.\r\n\r\n   I write these as I am starting.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he had written this, he kept it till the last moment in his\r\nhand, thinking that he would not send it. But as he slipped into the\r\ncab, he gave the note to his late landlady to post.\r\n\r\nAt the station Bunce came to him to say a word of farewell, and Mrs.\r\nBunce was on his arm.\r\n\r\n"Well done, Mr. Finn, well done," said Bunce. "I always knew there\r\nwas a good drop in you."\r\n\r\n"You always told me I should ruin myself in Parliament, and so I\r\nhave," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Not at all. It takes a deal to ruin a man if he\'s got the right\r\nsperrit. I\'ve better hopes of you now than ever I had in the old\r\ndays when you used to be looking out for Government place;--and Mr.\r\nMonk has tried that too. I thought he would find the iron too heavy\r\nfor him." "God bless you, Mr. Finn," said Mrs. Bunce with her\r\nhandkerchief up to her eyes. "There\'s not one of \'em I ever had as\r\nlodgers I\'ve cared about half as much as I did for you." Then they\r\nshook hands with him through the window, and the train was off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVI\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are told that it is a bitter moment with the Lord Mayor when he\r\nleaves the Mansion House and becomes once more Alderman Jones, of No.\r\n75, Bucklersbury. Lord Chancellors going out of office have a great\r\nfall though they take pensions with them for their consolation. And\r\nthe President of the United States when he leaves the glory of the\r\nWhite House and once more becomes a simple citizen must feel the\r\nchange severely. But our hero, Phineas Finn, as he turned his back\r\nupon the scene of his many successes, and prepared himself for\r\npermanent residence in his own country, was, I think, in a worse\r\nplight than any of the reduced divinities to whom I have alluded.\r\nThey at any rate had known that their fall would come. He, like\r\nIcarus, had flown up towards the sun, hoping that his wings of wax\r\nwould bear him steadily aloft among the gods. Seeing that his wings\r\nwere wings of wax, we must acknowledge that they were very good. But\r\nthe celestial lights had been too strong for them, and now, having\r\nlived for five years with lords and countesses, with Ministers and\r\norators, with beautiful women and men of fashion, he must start again\r\nin a little lodging in Dublin, and hope that the attorneys of that\r\nlitigious city might be good to him. On his journey home he made but\r\none resolution. He would make the change, or attempt to make it,\r\nwith manly strength. During his last month in London he had allowed\r\nhimself to be sad, depressed, and melancholy. There should be an end\r\nof all that now. Nobody at home should see that he was depressed.\r\nAnd Mary, his own Mary, should at any rate have no cause to think\r\nthat her love and his own engagement had ever been the cause to him\r\nof depression. Did he not value her love more than anything in the\r\nworld? A thousand times he told himself that he did.\r\n\r\nShe was there in the old house at Killaloe to greet him. Her\r\nengagement was an affair known to all the county, and she had no\r\nidea that it would become her to be coy in her love. She was in his\r\narms before he had spoken to his father and mother, and had made her\r\nlittle speech to him,--very inaudibly indeed,--while he was covering\r\nher sweet face with kisses. "Oh, Phineas, I am so proud of you; and\r\nI think you are so right, and I am so glad you have done it." Again\r\nhe covered her face with kisses. Could he ever have had such\r\nsatisfaction as this had he allowed Madame Goesler\'s hand to remain\r\nin his?\r\n\r\nOn the first night of his arrival he sat for an hour downstairs\r\nwith his father talking over his plans. He felt,--he could not but\r\nfeel,--that he was not the hero now that he had been when he was last\r\nat Killaloe,--when he had come thither with a Cabinet Minister under\r\nhis wing. And yet his father did his best to prevent the growth of\r\nany such feeling. The old doctor was not quite as well off as he had\r\nbeen when Phineas first started with his high hopes for London. Since\r\nthat day he had abandoned his profession and was now living on the\r\nfruits of his life\'s labour. For the last two years he had been\r\nabsolved from the necessity of providing an income for his son, and\r\nhad probably allowed himself to feel that no such demand upon him\r\nwould again be made. Now, however, it was necessary that he should do\r\nso. Could his son manage to live on two hundred a-year? There would\r\nthen be four hundred a-year left for the wants of the family at home.\r\nPhineas swore that he could fight his battle on a hundred and fifty,\r\nand they ended the argument by splitting the difference. He had been\r\npaying exactly the same sum of money for the rooms he had just left\r\nin London; but then, while he held those rooms, his income had been\r\ntwo thousand a-year. Tenant-right was a very fine thing, but could it\r\nbe worth such a fall as this?\r\n\r\n"And about dear Mary?" said the father.\r\n\r\n"I hope it may not be very long," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"I have not spoken to her about it, but your mother says that Mrs.\r\nFlood Jones is very averse to a long engagement."\r\n\r\n"What can I do? She would not wish me to marry her daughter with no\r\nother income than an allowance made by you."\r\n\r\n"Your mother says that she has some idea that you and she might live\r\ntogether;--that if they let Floodborough you might take a small house\r\nin Dublin. Remember, Phineas, I am not proposing it myself."\r\n\r\nThen Phineas bethought himself that he was not even yet so low in the\r\nworld that he need submit himself to terms dictated to him by Mrs.\r\nFlood Jones. "I am glad that you do not propose it, sir."\r\n\r\n"Why so, Phineas?"\r\n\r\n"Because I should have been obliged to oppose the plan even if it had\r\ncome from you. Mothers-in-law are never a comfort in a house."\r\n\r\n"I never tried it myself," said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"And I never will try it. I am quite sure that Mary does not expect\r\nany such thing, and that she is willing to wait. If I can shorten the\r\nterm of waiting by hard work, I will do so." The decision to which\r\nPhineas had come on this matter was probably made known to Mrs. Flood\r\nJones after some mild fashion by old Mrs. Finn. Nothing more was\r\nsaid to Phineas about a joint household; but he was quite able to\r\nperceive from the manner of the lady towards him that his proposed\r\nmother-in-law wished him to understand that he was treating her\r\ndaughter very badly. What did it signify? None of them knew the story\r\nof Madame Goesler, and of course none of them would know it. None of\r\nthem would ever hear how well he had behaved to his little Mary.\r\n\r\nBut Mary did know it all before he left her to go up to Dublin. The\r\ntwo lovers allowed themselves,--or were allowed by their elders, one\r\nweek of exquisite bliss together; and during this week, Phineas told\r\nher, I think, everything. He told her everything as far as he could\r\ndo so without seeming to boast of his own successes. How is a man\r\nnot to tell such tales when he has on his arm, close to him, a girl\r\nwho tells him her little everything of life, and only asks for his\r\nconfidence in return? And then his secrets are so precious to her and\r\nso sacred, that he feels as sure of her fidelity as though she were\r\na very goddess of faith and trust. And the temptation to tell is so\r\ngreat. For all that he has to tell she loves him the better and still\r\nthe better. A man desires to win a virgin heart, and is happy to\r\nknow,--or at least to believe,--that he has won it. With a woman\r\nevery former rival is an added victim to the wheels of the triumphant\r\nchariot in which she is sitting. "All these has he known and loved,\r\nculling sweets from each of them. But now he has come to me, and I am\r\nthe sweetest of them all." And so Mary was taught to believe of Laura\r\nand of Violet and of Madame Goesler,--that though they had had charms\r\nto please, her lover had never been so charmed as he was now while\r\nshe was hanging to his breast. And I think that she was right in her\r\nbelief. During those lovely summer evening walks along the shores of\r\nLough Derg, Phineas was as happy as he had ever been at any moment of\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\n"I shall never be impatient,--never," she said to him on the last\r\nevening. "All I want is that you should write to me."\r\n\r\n"I shall want more than that, Mary."\r\n\r\n"Then you must come down and see me. When you do come they will be\r\nhappy, happy days for me. But of course we cannot be married for the\r\nnext twenty years."\r\n\r\n"Say forty, Mary."\r\n\r\n"I will say anything that you like;--you will know what I mean just\r\nas well. And, Phineas, I must tell you one thing,--though it makes me\r\nsad to think of it, and will make me sad to speak of it."\r\n\r\n"I will not have you sad on our last night, Mary."\r\n\r\n"I must say it. I am beginning to understand how much you have given\r\nup for me."\r\n\r\n"I have given up nothing for you."\r\n\r\n"If I had not been at Killaloe when Mr. Monk was here, and if we had\r\nnot,--had not,--oh dear, if I had not loved you so very much, you\r\nmight have remained in London, and that lady would have been your\r\nwife."\r\n\r\n"Never!" said Phineas stoutly.\r\n\r\n"Would she not? She must not be your wife now, Phineas. I am not\r\ngoing to pretend that I will give you up."\r\n\r\n"That is unkind, Mary."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well; you may say what you please. If that is unkind, I am\r\nunkind. It would kill me to lose you."\r\n\r\nHad he done right? How could there be a doubt about it? How could\r\nthere be a question about it? Which of them had loved him, or was\r\ncapable of loving him as Mary loved him? What girl was ever so sweet,\r\nso gracious, so angelic, as his own Mary? He swore to her that he was\r\nprouder of winning her than of anything he had ever done in all his\r\nlife, and that of all the treasures that had ever come in his way she\r\nwas the most precious. She went to bed that night the happiest girl\r\nin all Connaught, although when she parted from him she understood\r\nthat she was not to see him again till Christmas-Eve.\r\n\r\nBut she did see him again before the summer was over, and the manner\r\nof their meeting was in this wise. Immediately after the passing of\r\nthat scrambled Irish Reform Bill, Parliament, as the reader knows,\r\nwas dissolved. This was in the early days of June, and before the end\r\nof July the new members were again assembled at Westminster. This\r\nsession, late in summer, was very terrible; but it was not very long,\r\nand then it was essentially necessary. There was something of the\r\nyear\'s business which must yet be done, and the country would require\r\nto know who were to be the Ministers of the Government. It is not\r\nneeded that the reader should be troubled any further with the\r\nstrategy of one political leader or of another, or that more should\r\nbe said of Mr. Monk and his tenant-right. The House of Commons had\r\noffended Mr. Gresham by voting in a majority against him, and Mr.\r\nGresham had punished the House of Commons by subjecting it to the\r\nexpense and nuisance of a new election. All this is constitutional,\r\nand rational enough to Englishmen, though it may be unintelligible to\r\nstrangers. The upshot on the present occasion was that the Ministers\r\nremained in their places and that Mr. Monk\'s bill, though it had\r\nreceived the substantial honour of a second reading, passed away for\r\nthe present into the limbo of abortive legislation.\r\n\r\nAll this would not concern us at all, nor our poor hero much, were\r\nit not that the great men with whom he had been for two years so\r\npleasant a colleague, remembered him with something of affectionate\r\nregret. Whether it began with Mr. Gresham or with Lord Cantrip, I\r\nwill not say;--or whether Mr. Monk, though now a political enemy,\r\nmay have said a word that brought about the good deed. Be that as it\r\nmay, just before the summer session was brought to a close Phineas\r\nreceived the following letter from Lord Cantrip:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Downing Street, August 4, 186--.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR MR. FINN,--\r\n\r\n   Mr. Gresham has been talking to me, and we both think\r\n   that possibly a permanent Government appointment may be\r\n   acceptable to you. We have no doubt, that should this be\r\n   the case, your services would be very valuable to the\r\n   country. There is a vacancy for a poor-law inspector at\r\n   present in Ireland, whose residence I believe should be\r\n   in Cork. The salary is a thousand a-year. Should the\r\n   appointment suit you, Mr. Gresham will be most happy to\r\n   nominate you to the office. Let me have a line at your\r\n   early convenience.\r\n\r\n   Believe me,\r\n\r\n   Most sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n   CANTRIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe received the letter one morning in Dublin, and within three hours\r\nhe was on his route to Killaloe. Of course he would accept the\r\nappointment, but he would not even do that without telling Mary of\r\nhis new prospect. Of course he would accept the appointment. Though\r\nhe had been as yet barely two months in Dublin, though he had hardly\r\nbeen long enough settled to his work to have hoped to be able to see\r\nin which way there might be a vista open leading to success, still he\r\nhad fancied that he had seen that success was impossible. He did not\r\nknow how to begin,--and men were afraid of him, thinking that he was\r\nunsteady, arrogant, and prone to failure. He had not seen his way to\r\nthe possibility of a guinea.\r\n\r\n"A thousand a-year!" said Mary Flood Jones, opening her eyes wide\r\nwith wonder at the golden future before them.\r\n\r\n"It is nothing very great for a perpetuity," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Phineas; surely a thousand a-year will be very nice."\r\n\r\n"It will be certain," said Phineas, "and then we can be married\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\n"But I have been making up my mind to wait ever so long," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"Then your mind must be unmade," said Phineas.\r\n\r\nWhat was the nature of the reply to Lord Cantrip the reader may\r\nimagine, and thus we will leave our hero an Inspector of Poor Houses\r\nin the County of Cork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PHINEAS FINN***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 18000.txt or 18000.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/8/0/0/18000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
