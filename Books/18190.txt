Dear old Raggedy Ann!\r\n\r\nThe same Raggedy Ann with which my mother played when a child.\r\n\r\nThere she sits, a trifle loppy and loose-jointed, looking me squarely in\r\nthe face in a straightforward, honest manner, a twinkle where her\r\nshoe-button eyes reflect the electric light.\r\n\r\nEvidently Raggedy has been to a "tea party" today, for her face is\r\ncovered with chocolate.\r\n\r\nShe smiles happily and continuously.\r\n\r\nTrue, she has been nibbled by mice, who have made nests out of the soft\r\ncotton with which she has been stuffed, but Raggedy smiled just as\r\nbroadly when the mice nibbled at her, for her smile is painted on.\r\n\r\nWhat adventures you must have had, Raggedy!\r\n\r\nWhat joy and happiness you have brought into this world!\r\n\r\nAnd no matter what treatment you have received, how patient you have\r\nbeen!\r\n\r\nWhat lessons of kindness and fortitude you might teach could you but\r\ntalk; you with your wisdom of fifty-nine years. No wonder Rag Dolls are\r\nthe best beloved! You are so kindly, so patient, so lovable.\r\n\r\nThe more you become torn, tattered and loose-jointed, Rag Dolls, the\r\nmore you are loved by children.\r\n\r\nWho knows but that Fairyland is filled with old, lovable Rag\r\nDolls--soft, loppy Rag Dolls who ride through all the wonders of\r\nFairyland in the crook of dimpled arms, snuggling close to childish\r\nbreasts within which beat hearts filled with eternal sunshine.\r\n\r\nSo, to the millions of children and grown-ups who have loved a Rag Doll,\r\nI dedicate these stories of Raggedy Ann.\r\n\r\n          JOHNNY GRUELLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nMarcella liked to play up in the attic at Grandma\'s quaint old house,\r\n\'way out in the country, for there were so many old forgotten things to\r\nfind up there.\r\n\r\nOne day when Marcella was up in the attic and had played with the old\r\nspinning wheel until she had grown tired of it, she curled up on an old\r\nhorse-hair sofa to rest.\r\n\r\n"I wonder what is in that barrel, \'way back in the corner?" she thought,\r\nas she jumped from the sofa and climbed over two dusty trunks to the\r\nbarrel standing back under the eaves.\r\n\r\nIt was quite dark back there, so when Marcella had pulled a large bundle\r\nof things from the barrel she took them over to the dormer window where\r\nshe could see better. There was a funny little bonnet with long white\r\nribbons. Marcella put it on.\r\n\r\nIn an old leather bag she found a number of tin-types of queer looking\r\nmen and women in old-fashioned clothes. And there was one picture of a\r\nvery pretty little girl with long curls tied tightly back from her\r\nforehead and wearing a long dress and queer pantaloons which reached to\r\nher shoe-tops. And then out of the heap she pulled an old rag doll with\r\nonly one shoe-button eye and a painted nose and a smiling mouth. Her\r\ndress was of soft material, blue with pretty little flowers and dots all\r\nover it.\r\n\r\nForgetting everything else in the happiness of her find, Marcella caught\r\nup the rag doll and ran downstairs to show it to Grandma.\r\n\r\n"Well! Well! Where did you find it?" Grandma cried. "It\'s old Raggedy\r\nAnn!" she went on as she hugged the doll to her breast. "I had\r\nforgotten her. She has been in the attic for fifty years, I guess! Well!\r\nWell! Dear old Raggedy Ann! I will sew another button on her right\r\naway!" and Grandma went to the machine drawer and got her needle and\r\nthread.\r\n\r\nMarcella watched the sewing while Grandma told how she had played with\r\nRaggedy Ann when she was a little girl.\r\n\r\n"Now!" Grandma laughed, "Raggedy Ann, you have two fine shoe-button eyes\r\nand with them you can see the changes that have taken place in the world\r\nwhile you have been shut up so long in the attic! For, Raggedy Ann, you\r\nhave a new playmate and mistress now, and I hope you both will have as\r\nmuch happiness together as you and I used to have!"\r\n\r\nThen Grandma gave Raggedy Ann to Marcella, saying very seriously,\r\n"Marcella, let me introduce my very dear friend, Raggedy Ann. Raggedy,\r\nthis is my grand-daughter, Marcella!" And Grandma gave the doll a twitch\r\nwith her fingers in such a way that the rag doll nodded her head to\r\nMarcella.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Grandma! Thank you ever and ever so much!" Marcella cried as she\r\ngave Grandma a hug and kiss. "Raggedy Ann and I will have just loads of\r\nfun."\r\n\r\nAnd this is how Raggedy Ann joined the doll family at Marcella\'s house,\r\nwhere she began the adventures of Raggedy Ann, told in the following\r\nstories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGGEDY ANN LEARNS A LESSON\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day the dolls were left all to themselves.\r\n\r\nTheir little mistress had placed them all around the room and told them\r\nto be nice children while she was away.\r\n\r\nAnd there they sat and never even so much as wiggled a finger, until\r\ntheir mistress had left the room.\r\n\r\nThen the soldier dolly turned his head and solemnly winked at Raggedy\r\nAnn.\r\n\r\nAnd when the front gate clicked and the dollies knew they were alone in\r\nthe house, they all scrambled to their feet.\r\n\r\n"Now let\'s have a good time!" cried the tin soldier. "Let\'s all go in\r\nsearch of something to eat!"\r\n\r\n"Yes! Let\'s all go in search of something to eat!" cried all the other\r\ndollies.\r\n\r\n"When Mistress had me out playing with her this morning," said Raggedy\r\nAnn, "she carried me by a door near the back of the house and I smelled\r\nsomething which smelled as if it would taste delicious!"\r\n\r\n"Then you lead the way, Raggedy Ann!" cried the French dolly.\r\n\r\n"I think it would be a good plan to elect Raggedy Ann as our leader on\r\nthis expedition!" said the Indian doll.\r\n\r\nAt this all the other dolls clapped their hands together and shouted,\r\n"Hurrah! Raggedy Ann will be our leader."\r\n\r\nSo Raggedy Ann, very proud indeed to have the confidence and love of all\r\nthe other dollies, said that she would be very glad to be their leader.\r\n\r\n"Follow me!" she cried as her wobbly legs carried her across the floor\r\nat a lively pace.\r\n\r\nThe other dollies followed, racing about the house until they came to\r\nthe pantry door. "This is the place!" cried Raggedy Ann, and sure\r\nenough, all the dollies smelled something which they knew must be very\r\ngood to eat.\r\n\r\nBut none of the dollies was tall enough to open the door and, although\r\nthey pushed and pulled with all their might, the door remained tightly\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nThe dollies were talking and pulling and pushing and every once in a\r\nwhile one would fall over and the others would step on her in their\r\nefforts to open the door. Finally Raggedy Ann drew away from the others\r\nand sat down on the floor.\r\n\r\nWhen the other dollies discovered Raggedy Ann sitting there, running her\r\nrag hands through her yarn hair, they knew she was thinking.\r\n\r\n"Sh! Sh!" they said to each other and quietly went over near Raggedy Ann\r\nand sat down in front of her.\r\n\r\n"There must be a way to get inside," said Raggedy Ann.\r\n\r\n"Raggedy says there must be a way to get inside!" cried all the dolls.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t seem to think clearly to-day," said Raggedy Ann. "It feels as\r\nif my head were ripped."\r\n\r\nAt this the French doll ran to Raggedy Ann and took off her bonnet.\r\n"Yes, there is a rip in your head, Raggedy!" she said and pulled a pin\r\nfrom her skirt and pinned up Raggedy\'s head. "It\'s not a very neat job,\r\nfor I got some puckers in it!" she said.\r\n\r\n"Oh that is ever so much better!" cried Raggedy Ann. "Now I can think\r\nquite clearly."\r\n\r\n"Now Raggedy can think quite clearly!" cried all the dolls.\r\n\r\n"My thoughts must have leaked out the rip before!" said Raggedy Ann.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"They must have leaked out before, dear Raggedy!" cried all the other\r\ndolls.\r\n\r\n"Now that I can think so clearly," said Raggedy Ann, "I think the door\r\nmust be locked and to get in we must unlock it!"\r\n\r\n"That will be easy!" said the Dutch doll who says "Mamma" when he is\r\ntipped backward and forward, "For we will have the brave tin soldier\r\nshoot the key out of the lock!"\r\n\r\n"I can easily do that!" cried the tin soldier, as he raised his gun.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Raggedy Ann!" cried the French dolly. "Please do not let him\r\nshoot!"\r\n\r\n"No!" said Raggedy Ann. "We must think of a quieter way!"\r\n\r\nAfter thinking quite hard for a moment, Raggedy Ann jumped up and said:\r\n"I have it!" And she caught up the Jumping Jack and held him up to the\r\ndoor; then Jack slid up his stick and unlocked the door.\r\n\r\nThen the dollies all pushed and the door swung open.\r\n\r\nMy! Such a scramble! The dolls piled over one another in their desire to\r\nbe the first at the goodies.\r\n\r\nThey swarmed upon the pantry shelves and in their eagerness spilled a\r\npitcher of cream which ran all over the French dolly\'s dress.\r\n\r\nThe Indian doll found some corn bread and dipping it in the molasses he\r\nsat down for a good feast.\r\n\r\nA jar of raspberry jam was overturned and the dollies ate of this until\r\ntheir faces were all purple.\r\n\r\nThe tin soldier fell from the shelf three times and bent one of his tin\r\nlegs, but he scrambled right back up again.\r\n\r\nNever had the dolls had so much fun and excitement, and they had all\r\neaten their fill when they heard the click of the front gate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThey did not take time to climb from the shelves, but all rolled or\r\njumped off to the floor and scrambled back to their room as fast as\r\nthey could run, leaving a trail of bread crumbs and jam along the way.\r\n\r\nJust as their mistress came into the room the dolls dropped in whatever\r\npositions they happened to be in.\r\n\r\n"This is funny!" cried Mistress. "They were all left sitting in their\r\nplaces around the room! I wonder if Fido has been shaking them up!" Then\r\nshe saw Raggedy Ann\'s face and picked her up. "Why Raggedy Ann, you are\r\nall sticky! I do believe you are covered with jam!" and Mistress tasted\r\nRaggedy Ann\'s hand. "Yes! It\'s JAM! Shame on you, Raggedy Ann! You\'ve\r\nbeen in the pantry and all the others, too!" and with this the dolls\'\r\nmistress dropped Raggedy Ann on the floor and left the room.\r\n\r\nWhen she came back she had on an apron and her sleeves were rolled up.\r\n\r\nShe picked up all the sticky dolls and putting them in a basket she\r\ncarried them out under the apple tree in the garden.\r\n\r\nThere she had placed her little tub and wringer and she took the dolls\r\none at a time, and scrubbed them with a scrubbing brush and soused them\r\nup and down and this way and that in the soap suds until they were\r\nclean.\r\n\r\nThen she hung them all out on the clothes-line in the sunshine to dry.\r\n\r\nThere the dolls hung all day, swinging and twisting about as the breeze\r\nswayed the clothes-line.\r\n\r\n"I do believe she scrubbed my face so hard she wore off my smile!" said\r\nRaggedy Ann, after an hour of silence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"No, it is still there!" said the tin solder, as the wind twisted him\r\naround so he could see Raggedy. "But I do believe my arms will never\r\nwork without squeaking, they feel so rusted," he added.\r\n\r\nJust then the wind twisted the little Dutch doll and loosened his\r\nclothes-pin, so that he fell to the grass below with a sawdusty bump and\r\nas he rolled over he said, "Mamma!" in a squeaky voice.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon the back door opened and the little mistress came\r\nout with a table and chairs. After setting the table she took all the\r\ndolls from the line and placed them about the table.\r\n\r\nThey had lemonade with grape jelly in it, which made it a beautiful\r\nlavender color, and little "Baby-teeny-weeny-cookies" with powdered\r\nsugar on them.\r\n\r\nAfter this lovely dinner, the dollies were taken in the house, where\r\nthey had their hair brushed and nice clean nighties put on.\r\n\r\nThen they were placed in their beds and Mistress kissed each one good\r\nnight and tiptoed from the room.\r\n\r\nAll the dolls lay as still as mice for a few minutes, then Raggedy Ann\r\nraised up on her cotton-stuffed elbows and said: "I have been thinking!"\r\n\r\n"Sh!" said all the other dollies, "Raggedy has been thinking!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Raggedy Ann, "I have been thinking; our mistress gave us the\r\nnice dinner out under the trees to teach us a lesson. She wished us to\r\nknow that we could have had all the goodies we wished, whenever we\r\nwished, if we had behaved ourselves. And our lesson was that we must\r\nnever take without asking what we could always have for the asking! So\r\nlet us all remember and try never again to do anything which might cause\r\nthose who love us any unhappiness!"\r\n\r\n"Let us all remember," chimed all the other dollies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnd Raggedy Ann, with a merry twinkle in her shoe-button eyes, lay back\r\nin her little bed, her cotton head filled with thoughts of love and\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGGEDY ANN AND THE WASHING\r\n\r\n\r\n"Why, Dinah! How could you!"\r\n\r\nMamma looked out of the window and saw Marcella run up to Dinah and take\r\nsomething out of her hand and then put her head in her arm and commence\r\ncrying.\r\n\r\n"What is the trouble, Dear?" Mamma asked, as she came out the door and\r\nknelt beside the little figure shaking with sobs.\r\n\r\nMarcella held out Raggedy Ann. But such a comical looking Raggedy Ann!\r\n\r\nMamma had to smile in spite of her sympathy, for Raggedy Ann looked\r\nridiculous!\r\n\r\nDinah\'s big eyes rolled out in a troubled manner, for Marcella had\r\nsnatched Raggedy Ann from Dinah\'s hand as she cried, "Why, Dinah! How\r\ncould you?"\r\n\r\nDinah could not quite understand and, as she dearly loved Marcella, she\r\nwas troubled.\r\n\r\nRaggedy Ann was not in the least downhearted and while she felt she must\r\nlook very funny she continued to smile, but with a more expansive smile\r\nthan ever before.\r\n\r\nRaggedy Ann knew just how it all happened and her remaining shoe-button\r\neye twinkled.\r\n\r\nShe remembered that morning when Marcella came to the nursery to take\r\nthe nighties from the dolls and dress them she had been cross.\r\n\r\nRaggedy Ann thought at the time "Perhaps she had climbed out of bed\r\nbackwards!" For Marcella complained to each doll as she dressed them.\r\n\r\nAnd when it came Raggedy\'s time to be dressed, Marcella was very cross\r\nfor she had scratched her finger on a pin when dressing the French doll.\r\n\r\nSo, when Marcella heard the little girl next door calling to her, she\r\nran out of the nursery and gave Raggedy Ann a toss from her as she ran.\r\n\r\nNow it happened Raggedy lit in the clothes hamper and there she lay all\r\ndoubled up in a knot.\r\n\r\nA few minutes afterwards Dinah came through the hall with an armful of\r\nclothes and piled them in the hamper on top of Raggedy Ann.\r\n\r\nThen Dinah carried the hamper out in back of the house where she did the\r\nwashing.\r\n\r\nDinah dumped all the clothes into the boiler and poured water on them.\r\n\r\nThe boiler was then placed upon the stove.\r\n\r\nWhen the water began to get warm, Raggedy Ann wiggled around and climbed\r\nup amongst the clothes to the top of the boiler to peek out. There was\r\ntoo much steam and she could see nothing. For that matter, Dinah could\r\nnot see Raggedy Ann, either, on account of the steam.\r\n\r\nSo Dinah, using an old broom handle, stirred the clothes in the boiler\r\nand the clothes and Raggedy Ann were stirred and whirled around until\r\nall were thoroughly boiled.\r\n\r\nWhen Dinah took the clothes a piece at a time from the boiler and\r\nscrubbed them, she finally came upon Raggedy Ann.\r\n\r\nNow Dinah did not know but that Marcella had placed Raggedy in the\r\nclothes hamper to be washed, so she soaped Raggedy well and scrubbed her\r\nup and down over the rough wash-board.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTwo buttons from the back of Raggedy\'s dress came off and one of\r\nRaggedy Ann\'s shoe-button eyes was loosened as Dinah gave her face a\r\nfinal scrub.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThen Dinah put Raggedy Ann\'s feet in the wringer and turned the crank.\r\nIt was hard work getting Raggedy through the wringer, but Dinah was very\r\nstrong. And of course it happened! Raggedy Ann came through as flat as a\r\npancake.\r\n\r\nIt was just then, that Marcella returned and saw Raggedy.\r\n\r\n"Why, Dinah! How could you!" Marcella had sobbed as she snatched the\r\nflattened Raggedy Ann from the bewildered Dinah\'s hand.\r\n\r\nMamma patted Marcella\'s hand and soon coaxed her to quit sobbing.\r\n\r\nWhen Dinah explained that the first she knew of Raggedy being in the\r\nwash was when she took her from the boiler, Marcella began crying again.\r\n\r\n"It was all my fault, Mamma!" she cried. "I remember now that I threw\r\ndear old Raggedy Ann from me as I ran out the door and she must have\r\nfallen in the clothes hamper! Oh dear! Oh dear!" and she hugged Raggedy\r\nAnn tight.\r\n\r\nMamma did not tell Marcella that she had been cross and naughty for she\r\nknew Marcella felt very sorry. Instead Mamma put her arms around her and\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n"Just see how Raggedy Ann takes it! She doesn\'t seem to be unhappy!"\r\n\r\nAnd when Marcella brushed her tears away and looked at Raggedy Ann, flat\r\nas a pancake and with a cheery smile upon her painted face, she had to\r\nlaugh. And Mamma and Dinah had to laugh, too, for Raggedy Ann\'s smile\r\nwas almost twice as broad as it had been before.\r\n\r\n"Just let me hang Miss Raggedy on the line in the bright sunshine for\r\nhalf an hour," said Dinah, "and you won\'t know her when she comes off!"\r\n\r\nSo Raggedy Ann was pinned to the clothes-line, out in the bright\r\nsunshine, where she swayed and twisted in the breeze and listened to the\r\nchatter of the robins in a nearby tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nEvery once in a while Dinah went out and rolled and patted Raggedy until\r\nher cotton stuffing was soft and dry and fluffy and her head and arms\r\nand legs were nice and round again.\r\n\r\nThen she took Raggedy Ann into the house and showed Marcella and Mamma\r\nhow clean and sweet she was.\r\n\r\nMarcella took Raggedy Ann right up to the nursery and told all the dolls\r\njust what had happened and how sorry she was that she had been so cross\r\nand peevish when she dressed them. And while the dolls said never a word\r\nthey looked at their little mistress with love in their eyes as she sat\r\nin the little red rocking chair and held Raggedy Ann tightly in her\r\narms.\r\n\r\nAnd Raggedy Ann\'s remaining shoe-button eye looked up at her little\r\nmistress in rather a saucy manner, but upon her face was the same old\r\nsmile of happiness, good humor and love.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nRAGGEDY ANN AND THE KITE\r\n\r\n\r\nRaggedy Ann watched with interest the preparations.\r\n\r\nA number of sticks were being fastened together with strings and covered\r\nwith light cloth.\r\n\r\nRaggedy Ann heard some of the boys talk of "The Kite," so Raggedy Ann\r\nknew this must be a kite.\r\n\r\nWhen a tail had been fastened to the kite and a large ball of heavy\r\ntwine tied to the front, one of the boys held the kite up in the air and\r\nanother boy walked off, unwinding the ball of twine.\r\n\r\nThere was a nice breeze blowing, so the boy with the twine called, "Let\r\n\'er go" and started running.\r\n\r\nMarcella held Raggedy up so that she could watch the kite sail through\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nHow nicely it climbed! But suddenly the kite acted strangely, and as all\r\nthe children shouted advice to the boy with the ball of twine, the kite\r\nbegan darting this way and that, and finally making four or five\r\nloop-the-loops, it crashed to the ground.\r\n\r\n"It needs more tail on it!" one boy shouted.\r\n\r\nThen the children asked each other where they might get more rags to\r\nfasten to the tail of the kite.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s tie Raggedy Ann to the tail!" suggested Marcella. "I know she\r\nwould enjoy a trip \'way up in the sky!"\r\n\r\nThe boys all shouted with delight at this new suggestion. So Raggedy Ann\r\nwas tied to the tail of the kite.\r\n\r\nThis time the kite rose straight in the air and remained steady. The boy\r\nwith the ball of twine unwound it until the kite and Raggedy Ann were\r\n\'way, \'way up and far away. How Raggedy Ann enjoyed being up there! She\r\ncould see for miles and miles! And how tiny the children looked!\r\n\r\nSuddenly a great puff of wind came and carried Raggedy Ann streaming\r\n\'way out behind the kite! She could hear the wind singing on the twine\r\nas the strain increased.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Raggedy Ann felt something rip. It was the rag to which she was\r\ntied. As each puff of wind caught her the rip widened.\r\n\r\nWhen Marcella watched Raggedy Ann rise high above the field, she\r\nwondered how much Raggedy Ann enjoyed it, and wished that she, too,\r\nmight have gone along. But after the kite had been up in the air for\r\nfive or ten minutes, Marcella grew restless. Kites were rather tiresome.\r\nThere was more fun in tea parties out under the apple tree.\r\n\r\n"Will you please pull down the kite now?" she asked the boy with the\r\ntwine. "I want Raggedy Ann."\r\n\r\n"Let her ride up there!" the boy replied. "We\'ll bring her home when we\r\npull down the kite! We\'re going to get another ball of twine and let her\r\ngo higher!"\r\n\r\nMarcella did not like to leave Raggedy Ann with the boys, so she sat\r\ndown upon the ground to wait until they pulled down the kite.\r\n\r\nBut while Marcella watched Raggedy Ann, a dot in the sky, she could not\r\nsee the wind ripping the rag to which Raggedy was tied.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the rag parted and Raggedy Ann went sailing away as the wind\r\ncaught in her skirts.\r\n\r\nMarcella jumped from the ground, too surprised to say anything. The\r\nkite, released from the weight of Raggedy Ann began darting and swooping\r\nto the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"We\'ll get her for you!" some of the boys said when they saw Marcella\'s\r\ntroubled face, and they started running in the direction Raggedy Ann had\r\nfallen. Marcella and the other girls ran with them. They ran, and they\r\nran, and they ran, and at last they found the kite upon the ground with\r\none of the sticks broken, but they could not find Raggedy Ann anywhere.\r\n\r\n"She must have fallen almost in your yard!" a boy said to Marcella, "for\r\nthe kite was directly over here when the doll fell!"\r\n\r\nMarcella was heartbroken. She went in the house and lay on the bed.\r\nMamma went out with the children and tried to find Raggedy Ann, but\r\nRaggedy Ann was nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\nWhen Daddy came home in the evening he tried to find Raggedy, but met\r\nwith no success. Marcella had eaten hardly any dinner, nor could she be\r\ncomforted by Mamma or Daddy. The other dolls in the nursery lay\r\nforgotten and were not put to bed that night, for Marcella lay and\r\nsobbed and tossed about her bed.\r\n\r\nFinally she said a little prayer for Raggedy Ann, and went to sleep. And\r\nas she slept Marcella dreamed that the fairies came and took Raggedy Ann\r\nwith them to fairyland for a visit, and then sent Raggedy Ann home to\r\nher. She awakened with a cry. Of course Mamma came to her bed right away\r\nand said that Daddy would offer a reward in the morning for the return\r\nof Raggedy.\r\n\r\n"It was all my fault, Mamma!" Marcella said. "I should not have offered\r\nthe boys dear old Raggedy Ann to tie on the tail of the kite! But I just\r\nknow the fairies will send her back."\r\n\r\nMamma took her in her arms and soothed her with cheering words, although\r\nshe felt indeed that Raggedy Ann was truly lost and would never be found\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nNow, where do you suppose Raggedy Ann was all this time?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen Raggedy Ann dropped from the kite, the wind caught in her skirts\r\nand carried her along until she fell in the fork of the large elm tree\r\ndirectly over Marcella\'s house. When Raggedy Ann fell with a thud, face\r\nup in the fork of the tree, two robins who had a nest near by flew\r\nchattering away.\r\n\r\nPresently the robins returned and quarreled at Raggedy Ann for laying so\r\nclose to their nest, but Raggedy Ann only smiled at them and did not\r\nmove.\r\n\r\nWhen the robins quieted down and quit their quarreling, one of them\r\nhopped up closer to Raggedy Ann in order to investigate.\r\n\r\nIt was Mamma Robin. She called to Daddy Robin and told him to come. "See\r\nthe nice yarn! We could use it to line the nest with," she said.\r\n\r\nSo the robins hopped closer to Raggedy Ann and asked if they might have\r\nsome of her yarn hair to line their nest. Raggedy Ann smiled at them. So\r\nthe two robins pulled and tugged at Raggedy Ann\'s yarn hair until they\r\nhad enough to line their nest nice and soft.\r\n\r\nEvening came and the robins sang their good night songs, and Raggedy Ann\r\nwatched the stars come out, twinkle all night and disappear in the\r\nmorning light. In the morning the robins again pulled yarn from Raggedy\r\nAnn\'s head, and loosened her so she could peep over the side of the\r\nlimb, and when the sun came up Raggedy Ann saw she was in the trees in\r\nher own yard.\r\n\r\nNow before she could eat any breakfast, Marcella started out to find\r\nRaggedy Ann. And, it was Marcella herself who found her. And this is how\r\nshe did it.\r\n\r\nMamma Robin had seen Marcella with Raggedy Ann out in the yard many\r\ntimes, so she began calling "Cheery! Cheery!" and Daddy Robin started\r\ncalling "Cheery! Cheery! Cheer up! Cheer up! Cheerily Cheerily! Cheery!\r\nCheery!" And Marcella looking up into the tree above the house to see\r\nthe robins, discovered Raggedy Ann peeping over the limb at her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOh, how her heart beat with happiness. "Here is Raggedy Ann," she\r\nshouted.\r\n\r\nAnd Mamma and Daddy came out and saw Raggedy smiling at them, and Daddy\r\ngot the clothes prop and climbed out of the attic window and poked\r\nRaggedy Ann out of the tree and she fell right into Marcella\'s arms\r\nwhere she was hugged in a tight embrace.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll never go up on a kite again, Raggedy Ann!" said Marcella, "for I\r\nfelt so lost without you. I will never let you leave me again."\r\n\r\nSo Raggedy Ann went into the house and had breakfast with her little\r\nmistress and Mamma and Daddy smiled at each other when they peeped\r\nthrough the door into the breakfast room, for Raggedy Ann\'s smile was\r\nwide and very yellow. Marcella, her heart full of happiness, was feeding\r\nRaggedy Ann part of her egg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nRAGGEDY ANN RESCUES FIDO\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was almost midnight and the dolls were asleep in their beds; all\r\nexcept Raggedy Ann.\r\n\r\nRaggedy lay there, her shoe-button eyes staring straight up at the\r\nceiling. Every once in a while Raggedy Ann ran her rag hand up through\r\nher yarn hair. She was thinking.\r\n\r\nWhen she had thought for a long, long time, Raggedy Ann raised herself\r\non her wabbly elbows and said, "I\'ve thought it all out."\r\n\r\nAt this the other dolls shook each other and raised up saying, "Listen!\r\nRaggedy has thought it all out!"\r\n\r\n"Tell us what you have been thinking, dear Raggedy," said the tin\r\nsoldier. "We hope they were pleasant thoughts."\r\n\r\n"Not very pleasant thoughts!" said Raggedy, as she brushed a tear from\r\nher shoe-button eyes. "You haven\'t seen Fido all day, have you?"\r\n\r\n"Not since early this morning," the French dolly said.\r\n\r\n"It has troubled me," said Raggedy, "and if my head was not stuffed with\r\nlovely new white cotton, I am sure it would have ached with the worry!\r\nWhen Mistress took me into the living-room this afternoon she was\r\ncrying, and I heard her mamma say, \'We will find him! He is sure to come\r\nhome soon!\' and I knew they were talking of Fido! He must be lost!"\r\n\r\nThe tin soldier jumped out of bed and ran over to Fido\'s basket, his tin\r\nfeet clicking on the floor as he went. "He is not here," he said.\r\n\r\n"When I was sitting in the window about noon-time," said the Indian\r\ndoll, "I saw Fido and a yellow scraggly dog playing out on the lawn and\r\nthey ran out through a hole in the fence!"\r\n\r\n"That was Priscilla\'s dog, Peterkins!" said the French doll.\r\n\r\n"I know poor Mistress is very sad on account of Fido," said the Dutch\r\ndoll, "because I was in the dining-room at supper-time and I heard her\r\ndaddy tell her to eat her supper and he would go out and find Fido; but\r\nI had forgotten all about it until now."\r\n\r\n"That is the trouble with all of us except Raggedy Ann!" cried the\r\nlittle penny doll, in a squeaky voice, "She has to think for all of us!"\r\n\r\n"I think it would be a good plan for us to show our love for Mistress\r\nand try and find Fido!" exclaimed Raggedy.\r\n\r\n"It is a good plan, Raggedy Ann!" cried all the dolls. "Tell us how to\r\nstart about it."\r\n\r\n"Well, first let us go out upon the lawn and see if we can track the\r\ndogs!" said Raggedy.\r\n\r\n"I can track them easily!" the Indian doll said, "for Indians are good\r\nat trailing things!"\r\n\r\n"Then let us waste no more time in talking!" said Raggedy Ann, as she\r\njumped from bed, followed by the rest.\r\n\r\nThe nursery window was open, so the dolls helped each other up on the\r\nsill and then jumped to the soft grass below. They fell in all sorts of\r\nqueer attitudes, but of course the fall did not hurt them.\r\n\r\nAt the hole in the fence the Indian doll picked up the trail of the two\r\ndogs, and the dolls, stringing out behind, followed him until they came\r\nto Peterkins\' house. Peterkins was surprised to see the strange little\r\nfigures in white nighties come stringing up the path to the dog house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPeterkins was too large to sleep in the nursery, so he had a nice cozy\r\ndog-house under the grape arbor.\r\n\r\n"Come in," Peterkins said when he saw and recognized the dolls, so all\r\nthe dollies went into Peterkins\' house and sat about while Raggedy told\r\nhim why they had come.\r\n\r\n"It has worried me, too!" said Peterkins, "but I had no way of telling\r\nyour mistress where Fido was, for she cannot understand dog language!\r\nFor you see," Peterkins continued, "Fido and I were having the grandest\r\nromp over in the park when a great big man with a funny thing on the end\r\nof a stick came running towards us. We barked at him and Fido thought he\r\nwas trying to play with us and went up too close and do you know, that\r\nwicked man caught Fido in the thing at the end of the stick and carried\r\nhim to a wagon and dumped him in with a lot of other dogs!"\r\n\r\n"_The Dog Catcher!_" cried Raggedy Ann.\r\n\r\n"Yes!" said Peterkins, as he wiped his eyes with his paws. "It was the\r\ndog catcher! For I followed the wagon at a distance and I saw him put\r\nall the dogs into a big wire pen, so that none could get out!"\r\n\r\n"Then you know the way there, Peterkins?" asked Raggedy Ann.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I can find it easily," Peterkins said.\r\n\r\n"Then show us the way!" Raggedy Ann cried, "for we must try to rescue\r\nFido."\r\n\r\nSo Peterkins led the way up alleys and across streets, the dolls all\r\npattering along behind him. It was a strange procession. Once a strange\r\ndog ran out at them, but Peterkins told him to mind his own business and\r\nthe strange dog returned to his own yard.\r\n\r\nAt last they came to the dog catcher\'s place. Some of the dogs in the\r\npen were barking at the moon and others were whining and crying.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere was Fido, all covered with mud, and his pretty red ribbon dragging\r\non the ground. My, but he was glad to see the dolls and Peterkins! All\r\nthe dogs came to the side of the pen and twisted their heads from side\r\nto side, gazing in wonder at the queer figures of the dolls.\r\n\r\n"We will try and let you out," said Raggedy Ann.\r\n\r\nAt this all the dogs barked joyfully.\r\n\r\nThen Raggedy Ann, the other dolls and Peterkins went to the gate.\r\n\r\nThe catch was too high for Raggedy Ann to reach, but Peterkins held\r\nRaggedy Ann in his mouth and stood up on his hind legs so that she could\r\nraise the catch.\r\n\r\nWhen the catch was raised, the dogs were so anxious to get out they\r\npushed and jumped against the gate so hard it flew open, knocking\r\nPeterkins and Raggedy Ann into the mud. Such a yapping and barking was\r\nnever heard in the neighborhood as when the dogs swarmed out of the\r\nenclosure, jumping over one another and scrambling about in the mad rush\r\nout the gate.\r\n\r\nFido picked himself up from where he had been rolled by the large dogs\r\nand helped Raggedy Ann to her feet. He, Peterkins, and all the dolls ran\r\nafter the pack of dogs, turning the corner just as the dog catcher came\r\nrunning out of the house in his nightgown to see what was causing the\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nHe stopped in astonishment when he saw the string of dolls in white\r\nnighties pattering down the alley, for he could not imagine what they\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nWell, you may be sure the dolls thanked Peterkins for his kind\r\nassistance and they and Fido ran on home, for a faint light was\r\nbeginning to show in the east where the sun was getting ready to come\r\nup.\r\n\r\nWhen they got to their own home they found an old chair out in the yard\r\nand after a great deal of work they finally dragged it to the window and\r\nthus managed to get into the nursery again.\r\n\r\nFido was very grateful to Raggedy Ann and the other dolls and before he\r\nwent to his basket he gave them each a lick on the cheek.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe dolls lost no time in scrambling into bed and pulling up the covers,\r\nfor they were very sleepy, but just as they were dozing off, Raggedy Ann\r\nraised herself and said, "If my legs and arms were not stuffed with nice\r\nclean cotton I feel sure they would ache, but being stuffed with nice\r\nclean white cotton, they do not ache and I could not feel happier if my\r\nbody were stuffed with sunshine, for I know how pleased and happy\r\nMistress will be in the morning when she discovers Fido asleep in his\r\nown little basket, safe and sound at home."\r\n\r\nAnd as the dollies by this time were all asleep, Raggedy Ann pulled the\r\nsheet up to her chin and smiled so hard she ripped two stitches out of\r\nthe back of her rag head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGGEDY ANN AND THE PAINTER\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen housecleaning time came around, Mistress\' mamma decided that she\r\nwould have the nursery repainted and new paper put upon the walls. That\r\nwas why all the dolls happened to be laid helter-skelter upon one of the\r\nhigh shelves.\r\n\r\nMistress had been in to look at them and wished to put them to bed, but\r\nas the painters were coming again in the early morning, Mamma thought it\r\nbest that their beds be piled in the closet.\r\n\r\nSo the dolls\' beds were piled into the closet, one on top of another and\r\nthe dolls were placed upon the high shelf.\r\n\r\nWhen all was quiet that night, Raggedy Ann who was on the bottom of the\r\npile of dolls spoke softly and asked the others if they would mind\r\nmoving along the shelf.\r\n\r\n"The cotton in my body is getting mashed as flat as a pancake!" said\r\nRaggedy Ann. And although the tin soldier was piled so that his foot was\r\npressed into Raggedy\'s face, she still wore her customary smile.\r\n\r\nSo the dolls began moving off to one side until Raggedy Ann was free to\r\nsit up.\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s a great deal better!" she said, stretching her arms and legs\r\nto get the kinks out of them, and patting her dress into shape.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll be glad when morning comes!" she said finally, "for I know\r\nMistress will take us out in the yard and play with us under the trees."\r\n\r\nSo the dolls sat and talked until daylight, when the painters came to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nOne of the painters, a young fellow, seeing the dolls, reached up and\r\ntook Raggedy Ann down from the shelf.\r\n\r\n"Look at this rag doll, Jim," he said to one of the other painters,\r\n"She\'s a daisy," and he took Raggedy Ann by the hands and danced with\r\nher while he whistled a lively tune. Raggedy Ann\'s heels hit the floor\r\nthumpity-thump and she enjoyed it immensely.\r\n\r\nThe other dolls sat upon the shelf and looked straight before them, for\r\nit would never do to let grown-up men know that dolls were really alive.\r\n\r\n"Better put her back upon the shelf," said one of the other men. "You\'ll\r\nhave the little girl after you! The chances are that she likes that old\r\nrag doll better than any of the others!"\r\n\r\nBut the young painter twisted Raggedy Ann into funny attitudes and\r\nlaughed and laughed as she looped about. Finally he got to tossing her\r\nup in the air and catching her. This was great fun for Raggedy and as\r\nshe sailed up by the shelf the dolls all smiled at her, for it pleased\r\nthem whenever Raggedy Ann was happy.\r\n\r\nBut the young fellow threw Raggedy Ann up into the air once too often\r\nand when she came down he failed to catch her and she came down\r\n_splash_, head first into a bucket of oily paint.\r\n\r\n"I told you!" said the older painter, "and now you are in for it!"\r\n\r\n"My goodness! I didn\'t mean to do it!" said the young fellow, "What had\r\nI better do with her?"\r\n\r\n"Better put her back on the shelf!" replied the other.\r\n\r\nSo Raggedy was placed back upon the shelf and the paint ran from her\r\nhead and trickled down upon her dress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, Mistress came into the nursery and saw Raggedy all\r\ncovered with paint and she began crying.\r\n\r\nThe young painter felt sorry and told her how it had happened.\r\n\r\n"If you will let me," he said, "I will take her home with me and will\r\nclean her up tonight and will bring her back day after tomorrow."\r\n\r\nSo Raggedy was wrapped in a newspaper that evening and carried away.\r\n\r\nAll the dolls felt sad that night without Raggedy Ann near them.\r\n\r\n"Poor Raggedy! I could have cried when I saw her all covered with\r\npaint!" said the French doll.\r\n\r\n"She didn\'t look like our dear old Raggedy Ann at all!" said the tin\r\nsoldier, who wiped the tears from his eyes so that they would not run\r\ndown on his arms and rust them.\r\n\r\n"The paint covered her lovely smile and nose and you could not see the\r\nlaughter in her shoe-button eyes!" said the Indian doll.\r\n\r\nAnd so the dolls talked that night and the next. But in the daytime\r\nwhen the painters were there, they kept very quiet.\r\n\r\nThe second day Raggedy was brought home and the dolls were all anxious\r\nfor night to come so that they could see and talk with Raggedy Ann.\r\n\r\nAt last the painters left and the house was quiet, for Mistress had been\r\nin and placed Raggedy on the shelf with the other dolls.\r\n\r\n"Tell us all about it, Raggedy dear!" the dolls cried.\r\n\r\n"Oh I am so glad I fell in the paint!" cried Raggedy, after she had\r\nhugged all the dolls, "For I have had the happiest time. The painter\r\ntook me home and told his Mamma how I happened to be covered with paint\r\nand she was very sorry. She took a rag and wiped off my shoe-button eyes\r\nand then I saw that she was a very pretty, sweet-faced lady and she got\r\nsome cleaner and wiped off most of the paint on my face.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"But you know," Raggedy continued, "the paint had soaked through my rag\r\nhead and had made the cotton inside all sticky and soggy and I could not\r\nthink clearly. And my yarn hair was all matted with paint.\r\n\r\n"So the kind lady took off my yarn hair and cut the stitches out of my\r\nhead, and took out all the painty cotton.\r\n\r\n"It was a great relief, although it felt queer at first and my thoughts\r\nseemed scattered.\r\n\r\n"She left me in her work-basket that night and hung me out upon the\r\nclothes-line the next morning when she had washed the last of the paint\r\noff.\r\n\r\n"And while I hung out on the clothes-line, what do you think?"\r\n\r\n"We could never guess!" all the dolls cried.\r\n\r\n"Why a dear little Jenny Wren came and picked enough cotton out of me to\r\nmake a cute little cuddly nest in the grape arbor!"\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t that sweet!" cried all the dolls.\r\n\r\n"Yes indeed it was!" replied Raggedy Ann, "It made me very happy. Then\r\nwhen the lady took me in the house again she stuffed me with lovely nice\r\nnew cotton, all the way from my knees up and sewed me up and put new\r\nyarn on my head for hair and--and--and it\'s a secret!" said Raggedy Ann.\r\n\r\n"Oh tell us the secret!" cried all the dolls, as they pressed closer to\r\nRaggedy. "Well, I know you will not tell anyone who would not be glad to\r\nknow about it, so I will tell you the secret and why I am wearing my\r\nsmile a trifle broader!" said Raggedy Ann.\r\n\r\nThe dolls all said that Raggedy Ann\'s smile was indeed a quarter of an\r\ninch wider on each side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"When the dear lady put the new white cotton in my body," said Raggedy\r\nAnn "she went to the cupboard and came back with a paper bag. And she\r\ntook from the bag ten or fifteen little candy hearts with mottos on them\r\nand she hunted through the candy hearts until she found a beautiful\r\nred one which she sewed up in me with the cotton! So that is the\r\nsecret, and that is why I am so happy! Feel here," said Raggedy Ann. All\r\nthe dolls could feel Raggedy Ann\'s beautiful new candy heart and they\r\nwere very happy for her.\r\n\r\nAfter all had hugged each other good night and had cuddled up for the\r\nnight, the tin soldier asked, "Did you have a chance to see what the\r\nmotto on your new candy heart was, Raggedy Ann?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," replied Raggedy Ann, "I was so happy I forgot to tell you. It\r\nhad printed upon it in nice blue letters, \'I LOVE YOU.\'"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGGEDY ANN\'S TRIP ON THE RIVER\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Marcella had a tea party out in the orchard, of course all of the\r\ndolls were invited. Raggedy Ann, the tin soldier, the Indian doll and\r\nall the others--even the four little penny dolls in the spool box. After\r\na lovely tea party with ginger cookies and milk, of course the dolls\r\nwere very sleepy, at least Marcella thought so, so she took all except\r\nRaggedy Ann into the house and put them to bed for the afternoon nap.\r\nThen Marcella told Raggedy Ann to stay there and watch the things.\r\n\r\nAs there was nothing else to do, Raggedy Ann waited for Marcella to\r\nreturn. And as she watched the little ants eating cookie crumbs Marcella\r\nhad thrown to them, she heard all of a sudden the patter of puppy feet\r\nbehind her. It was Fido.\r\n\r\nThe puppy dog ran up to Raggedy Ann and twisted his head about as he\r\nlooked at her. Then he put his front feet out and barked in Raggedy\r\nAnn\'s face. Raggedy Ann tried to look very stern, but she could not hide\r\nthe broad smile painted on her face.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you want to play, do you?" the puppy dog barked, as he jumped at\r\nRaggedy Ann and then jumped back again.\r\n\r\nThe more Raggedy Ann smiled, the livelier Fido\'s antics became, until\r\nfinally he caught the end of her dress and dragged her about.\r\n\r\nThis was great fun for the puppy dog, but Raggedy Ann did not enjoy it.\r\nShe kicked and twisted as much as she could, but the puppy dog thought\r\nRaggedy was playing.\r\n\r\nHe ran out the garden gate and down the path across the meadow, every\r\nonce in a while stopping and pretending he was very angry. When he\r\npretended this, Fido would give Raggedy Ann a great shaking, making her\r\nyarn head hit the ground "ratty-tat-tat." Then he would give his head a\r\ntoss and send Raggedy Ann high in the air where she would turn over two\r\nor three times before she reached the ground.\r\n\r\nBy this time, she had lost her apron and now some of her yarn hair was\r\ncoming loose.\r\n\r\nAs Fido neared the brook, another puppy dog came running across the\r\nfoot-bridge to meet him. "What have you there, Fido?" said the new puppy\r\ndog as he bounced up to Raggedy Ann.\r\n\r\n"This is Raggedy Ann," answered Fido. "She and I are having a lovely\r\ntime playing."\r\n\r\nYou see, Fido really thought Raggedy enjoyed being tossed around and\r\nwhirled high up in the air. But of course she didn\'t. However, the game\r\ndidn\'t last much longer. As Raggedy Ann hit the ground the new puppy dog\r\ncaught her dress and ran with her across the bridge, Fido barking close\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nIn the center of the bridge, Fido caught up with the new puppy dog and\r\nthey had a lively tug-of-war with Raggedy Ann stretched between then. As\r\nthey pulled and tugged and flopped Raggedy Ann about, somehow she fell\r\nover the side of the bridge into the water.\r\n\r\nThe puppy dogs were surprised, and Fido was very sorry indeed, for he\r\nremembered how good Raggedy Ann had been to him and how she had rescued\r\nhim from the dog-pound. But the current carried Raggedy Ann right along\r\nand all Fido could do was to run along the bank and bark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNow, you would have thought Raggedy Ann would sink, but no, she floated\r\nnicely, for she was stuffed with clean white cotton and the water didn\'t\r\nsoak through very quickly.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, the strange puppy and Fido grew tired of running along\r\nthe bank and the strange puppy scampered home over the meadow, with his\r\ntail carried gaily over his back as if he had nothing to be ashamed of.\r\nBut Fido walked home very sorry indeed. His little heart was broken to\r\nthink that he had caused Raggedy Ann to be drowned.\r\n\r\nBut Raggedy Ann didn\'t drown--not a bit of it. In fact, she even went to\r\nsleep on the brook, for the motion of the current was very soothing as\r\nit carried her along--just like being rocked by Marcella.\r\n\r\nSo, sleeping peacefully, Raggedy Ann drifted along with the current\r\nuntil she came to a pool where she lodged against a large stone.\r\n\r\nRaggedy Ann tried to climb upon the stone, but by this time the water\r\nhad thoroughly soaked through Raggedy Ann\'s nice, clean, white cotton\r\nstuffing and she was so heavy she could not climb.\r\n\r\nSo there she had to stay until Marcella and Daddy came along and found\r\nher.\r\n\r\nYou see, they had been looking for her. They had found pieces of her\r\napron all along the path and across the meadow where Fido and the\r\nstrange puppy dog had shaken them from Raggedy Ann. So they followed the\r\nbrook until they found her.\r\n\r\nWhen Daddy fished Raggedy Ann from the water, Marcella hugged her so\r\ntightly to her breast the water ran from Raggedy Ann and dripped all\r\nover Marcella\'s apron. But Marcella was so glad to find Raggedy Ann\r\nagain she didn\'t mind it a bit. She just hurried home and took off all\r\nof Raggedy Ann\'s wet clothes and placed her on a little red chair in\r\nfront of the oven door, and then brought all of the other dolls in and\r\nread a fairy tale to them while Raggedy Ann steamed and dried.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen Raggedy Ann was thoroughly dry, Mamma said she thought the cake\r\nmust be finished and she took from the oven a lovely chocolate cake and\r\ngave Marcella a large piece to have another tea party with.\r\n\r\nThat night when all the house was asleep, Raggedy Ann raised up in bed\r\nand said to the dolls who were still awake, "I am so happy I do not feel\r\na bit sleepy. Do you know, I believe the water soaked me so thoroughly\r\nmy candy heart must have melted and filled my whole body, and I do not\r\nfeel the least bit angry with Fido for playing with me so roughly!"\r\n\r\nSo all the other dolls were happy, too, for happiness is very easy to\r\ncatch when we love one another and are sweet all through.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGGEDY ANN AND THE STRANGE DOLLS\r\n\r\n\r\nRaggedy Ann lay just as Marcella had dropped her--all sprawled out with\r\nher rag arms and legs twisted in ungraceful attitudes.\r\n\r\nHer yarn hair was twisted and lay partly over her face, hiding one of\r\nher shoe-button eyes.\r\n\r\nRaggedy gave no sign that she had heard, but lay there smiling at the\r\nceiling.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Raggedy Ann knew that what the new dolls said was true.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes the truth may hurt and this may have been the reason\r\nRaggedy Ann lay there so still.\r\n\r\n"Did you ever see such an ungainly creature!"\r\n\r\n"I do believe it has shoe buttons for eyes!"\r\n\r\n"And yarn hair!"\r\n\r\n"Mercy, did you ever see such feet!"\r\n\r\nThe Dutch doll rolled off the doll sofa and said "Mamma" in his quavery\r\nvoice, he was so surprised at hearing anyone speak so of beloved Raggedy\r\nAnn--dear Raggedy Ann, she of the candy heart, whom all the dolls loved.\r\n\r\nUncle Clem was also very much surprised and offended. He walked up in\r\nfront of the two new dolls and looked them sternly in the eyes, but he\r\ncould think of nothing to say so he pulled at his yarn mustache.\r\n\r\nMarcella had only received the two new dolls that morning. They had come\r\nin the morning mail and were presents from an aunt.\r\n\r\nMarcella had named the two new dolls Annabel-Lee and Thomas, after her\r\naunt and uncle.\r\n\r\nAnnabel-Lee and Thomas were beautiful dolls and must have cost heaps and\r\nheaps of shiny pennies, for both were handsomely dressed and had _real_\r\nhair!\r\n\r\nAnnabel\'s hair was of a lovely shade of auburn and Thomas\' was golden\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\nAnnabel was dressed in soft, lace-covered silk and upon her head she\r\nwore a beautiful hat with long silk ribbons tied in a neat bow-knot\r\nbeneath her dimpled chin.\r\n\r\nThomas was dressed in an Oliver Twist suit of dark velvet with a lace\r\ncollar. Both he and Annabel wore lovely black slippers and short\r\nstockings.\r\n\r\nThey were sitting upon two of the little red doll chairs where Marcella\r\nhad placed them and where they could see the other dolls.\r\n\r\nWhen Uncle Clem walked in front of them and pulled his mustache they\r\nlaughed outright. "Tee-Hee-Hee!" they snickered, "He has holes in his\r\nknees!"\r\n\r\nQuite true. Uncle Clem was made of worsted and the moths had eaten his\r\nknees and part of his kiltie. He had a kiltie, you see, for Uncle Clem\r\nwas a Scotch doll.\r\n\r\nUncle Clem shook, but he felt so hurt he could think of nothing to say.\r\n\r\nHe walked over and sat down beside Raggedy Ann and brushed her yarn hair\r\naway from her shoe-button eye.\r\n\r\nThe tin soldier went over and sat beside them.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you mind what they say, Raggedy!" he said, "They do not know you\r\nas we do!"\r\n\r\n"We don\'t care to know her!" said Annabel-Lee as she primped her dress,\r\n"She looks like a scarecrow!"\r\n\r\n"And the Soldier must have been made with a can opener!" laughed\r\nThomas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"You should be ashamed of yourselves!" said the French dolly, as she\r\nstood before Annabel and Thomas, "You will make all of us sorry that you\r\nhave joined our family if you continue to poke fun at us and look down\r\nupon us. We are all happy here together and share in each others\'\r\nadventures and happiness."\r\n\r\nNow, that night Marcella did not undress the two new dolls, for she had\r\nno nighties for them, so she let them sit up in the two little red doll\r\nchairs so they would not muss their clothes. "I will make nighties for\r\nyou tomorrow!" she said as she kissed them good night. Then she went\r\nover and gave Raggedy Ann a good night hug. "Take good care of all my\r\nchildren, Raggedy!" she said as she went out.\r\n\r\nAnnabel and Thomas whispered together, "Perhaps we have been too hasty\r\nin our judgment!" said Annabel-Lee. "This Raggedy Ann seems to be a\r\nfavorite with the mistress and with all the dolls!"\r\n\r\n"There must be a reason!" replied Thomas, "I am beginning to feel sorry\r\nthat we spoke of her looks. One really cannot help one\'s looks after\r\nall."\r\n\r\nNow, Annabel-Lee and Thomas were very tired after their long journey and\r\nsoon they fell asleep and forgot all about the other dolls.\r\n\r\nWhen they were sound asleep, Raggedy Ann slipped quietly from her bed\r\nand awakened the tin soldier and Uncle Clem and the three tiptoed to the\r\ntwo beautiful new dolls.\r\n\r\nThey lifted them gently so as not to awaken them and carried them to\r\nRaggedy Ann\'s bed.\r\n\r\nRaggedy Ann tucked them in snugly and lay down upon the hard floor.\r\n\r\nThe tin soldier and Uncle Clem both tried to coax Raggedy Ann into\r\naccepting their bed (they slept together), but Raggedy Ann would not\r\nhear of it.\r\n\r\n"I am stuffed with nice soft cotton and the hard floor does not bother\r\nme at all!" said Raggedy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAt daybreak the next morning Annabel and Thomas awakened to find\r\nthemselves in Raggedy Ann\'s bed and as they raised up and looked at each\r\nother each knew how ashamed the other felt, for they knew Raggedy Ann\r\nhad generously given them her bed.\r\n\r\nThere Raggedy Ann lay; all sprawled out upon the hard floor, her rag\r\narms and legs twisted in ungraceful attitudes.\r\n\r\n"How good and honest she looks!" said Annabel. "It must be her\r\nshoe-button eyes!"\r\n\r\n"How nicely her yarn hair falls in loops over her face!" exclaimed\r\nThomas, "I did not notice how pleasant her face looked last night!"\r\n\r\n"The others seem to love her ever and ever so much!" mused Annabel. "It\r\nmust be because she is so kind."\r\n\r\nBoth new dolls were silent for a while, thinking deeply.\r\n\r\n"How do you feel?" Thomas finally asked.\r\n\r\n"Very much ashamed of myself!" answered Annabel, "And you, Thomas?"\r\n\r\n"As soon as Raggedy Ann awakens, I shall tell her just how much ashamed\r\nI am of myself and if she can, I want her to forgive me!" Thomas said.\r\n\r\n"The more I look at her, the better I like her!" said Annabel.\r\n\r\n"I am going to kiss her!" said Thomas.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll awaken her if you do!" said Annabel.\r\n\r\nBut Thomas climbed out of bed and kissed Raggedy Ann on her painted\r\ncheek and smoothed her yarn hair from her rag forehead.\r\n\r\nAnd Annabel-Lee climbed out of bed, too, and kissed Raggedy Ann.\r\n\r\nThen Thomas and Annabel-Lee gently carried Raggedy Ann and put her in\r\nher own bed and tenderly tucked her in, and then took their seats in the\r\ntwo little red chairs.\r\n\r\nAfter a while Annabel said softly to Thomas, "I feel ever and ever so\r\nmuch better and happier!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"So do I!" Thomas replied. "It\'s like a whole lot of sunshine coming\r\ninto a dark room, and I shall always try to keep it there!"\r\n\r\nFido had one fuzzy white ear sticking up over the edge of his basket and\r\nhe gave his tail a few thumps against his pillow.\r\n\r\nRaggedy Ann lay quietly in bed where Thomas and Annabel had tucked her.\r\nAnd as she smiled at the ceiling, her candy heart (with "I LOVE YOU"\r\nwritten on it) thrilled with contentment, for, as you have probably\r\nguessed, Raggedy Ann had not been asleep at all!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGGEDY ANN AND THE KITTENS\r\n\r\n\r\nRaggedy Ann had been away all day.\r\n\r\nMarcella had come early in the morning and dressed all the dolls and\r\nplaced them about the nursery.\r\n\r\nSome of the dolls had been put in the little red chairs around the\r\nlittle doll table. There was nothing to eat upon the table except a\r\nturkey, a fried egg and an apple, all made of plaster of paris and\r\npainted in natural colors. The little teapot and other doll dishes were\r\nempty, but Marcella had told them to enjoy their dinner while she was\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe French dolly had been given a seat upon the doll sofa and Uncle Clem\r\nhad been placed at the piano.\r\n\r\nMarcella picked up Raggedy Ann and carried her out of the nursery when\r\nshe left, telling the dolls to "be real good children, while Mamma is\r\naway!"\r\n\r\nWhen the door closed, the tin soldier winked at the Dutch-boy doll and\r\nhanded the imitation turkey to the penny dolls. "Have some nice turkey?"\r\nhe asked.\r\n\r\n"No thank you!" the penny dolls said in little penny-doll, squeaky\r\nvoices, "We have had all we can eat!"\r\n\r\n"Shall I play you a tune?" asked Uncle Clem of the French doll.\r\n\r\nAt this all the dolls laughed, for Uncle Clem could not begin to play\r\nany tune. Raggedy Ann was the only doll who had ever taken lessons, and\r\nshe could play Peter-Peter-Pumpkin-Eater with one hand.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Marcella had almost worn out Raggedy Ann\'s right hand teaching\r\nit to her.\r\n\r\n"Play something lively!" said the French doll, as she giggled behind her\r\nhand, so Uncle Clem began hammering the eight keys on the toy piano with\r\nall his might until a noise was heard upon the stairs.\r\n\r\nQuick as a wink, all the dolls took the same positions in which they had\r\nbeen placed by Marcella, for they did not wish really truly people to\r\nknow that they could move about.\r\n\r\nBut it was only Fido. He put his nose in the door and looked around.\r\n\r\nAll the dolls at the table looked steadily at the painted food, and\r\nUncle Clem leaned upon the piano keys looking just as unconcerned as\r\nwhen he had been placed there.\r\n\r\nThen Fido pushed the door open and came into the nursery wagging his\r\ntail.\r\n\r\nHe walked over to the table and sniffed, in hopes Marcella had given the\r\ndolls real food and that some would still be left.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Raggedy Ann?" Fido asked, when he had satisfied himself that\r\nthere was no food.\r\n\r\n"Mistress took Raggedy Ann and went somewhere!" all the dolls answered\r\nin chorus.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve found something I must tell Raggedy Ann about!" said Fido, as he\r\nscratched his ear.\r\n\r\n"Is it a secret?" asked the penny dolls.\r\n\r\n"Secret nothing," replied Fido, "It\'s kittens!"\r\n\r\n"How lovely!" cried all the dolls, "Really live kittens?"\r\n\r\n"Really live kittens!" replied Fido, "Three little tiny ones, out in the\r\nbarn!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I wish Raggedy Ann was here!" cried the French doll. "She would\r\nknow what to do about it!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"That\'s why I wanted to see her," said Fido, as he thumped his tail on\r\nthe floor, "I did not know there were any kittens and I went into the\r\nbarn to hunt for mice and the first thing I knew Mamma Cat came bouncing\r\nright at me with her eyes looking green! I tell you I hurried out of\r\nthere!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"How did you know there were any kittens then?" asked Uncle Clem.\r\n\r\n"I waited around the barn until Mamma Cat went up to the house and then\r\nI slipped into the barn again, for I knew there must be something inside\r\nor she would not have jumped at me that way! We are always very friendly,\r\nyou know." Fido continued. "And what was my surprise to find three tiny\r\nlittle kittens in an old basket, \'way back in a dark corner!"\r\n\r\n"Go get them, Fido, and bring them up so we can see them!" said the tin\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\n"Not me!" said Fido, "If I had a suit of tin clothes on like you have I\r\nmight do it, but you know cats can scratch very hard if they want to!"\r\n\r\n"We will tell Raggedy when she comes in!" said the French doll, and then\r\nFido went out to play with a neighbor dog.\r\n\r\nSo when Raggedy Ann had been returned to the nursery the dolls could\r\nhardly wait until Marcella had put on their nighties and left them for\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nThen they told Raggedy Ann all about the kittens.\r\n\r\nRaggedy Ann jumped from her bed and ran over to Fido\'s basket; he wasn\'t\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThen Raggedy suggested that all the dolls go out to the barn and see the\r\nkittens. This they did easily, for the window was open and it was but a\r\nshort jump to the ground.\r\n\r\nThey found Fido out near the barn watching a hole.\r\n\r\n"I was afraid something might disturb them," he said, "for Mamma Cat\r\nwent away about an hour ago."\r\n\r\nAll the dolls, with Raggedy Ann in the lead, crawled through the hole\r\nand ran to the basket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nJust as Raggedy Ann started to pick up one of the kittens there was a\r\nlot of howling and yelping and Fido came bounding through the hole with\r\nMamma Cat behind him. When Mamma Cat caught up with Fido he would yelp.\r\n\r\nWhen Fido and Mamma Cat had circled the barn two or three times Fido\r\nmanaged to find the hole and escape to the yard; then Mamma Cat came\r\nover to the basket and saw all the dolls.\r\n\r\n"I\'m s\'prised at you, Mamma Cat!" said Raggedy Ann, "Fido has been\r\nwatching your kittens for an hour while you were away. He wouldn\'t hurt\r\nthem for anything!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, then," said Mamma Cat.\r\n\r\n"You must trust Fido, Mamma Cat!" said Raggedy Ann, "because he loves\r\nyou and anyone who loves you can be trusted!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s so!" replied Mamma Cat. "Cats love mice, too, and I wish the\r\nmice trusted us more!"\r\n\r\nThe dolls all laughed at this joke.\r\n\r\n"Have you told the folks up at the house about your dear little\r\nkittens?" Raggedy Ann asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my, no!" exclaimed Mamma Cat. "At the last place I lived the people\r\nfound out about my kittens and do you know, all the kittens disappeared!\r\nI intend keeping this a secret!"\r\n\r\n"But all the folks at this house are very kindly people and would dearly\r\nlove your kittens!" cried all the dolls.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s take them right up to the nursery!" said Raggedy Ann, "And\r\nMistress can find them there in the morning!"\r\n\r\n"How lovely!" said all the dolls in chorus. "Do, Mamma Cat! Raggedy Ann\r\nknows, for she is stuffed with nice clean white cotton and is very\r\nwise!"\r\n\r\nSo after a great deal of persuasion, Mamma Cat finally consented.\r\nRaggedy Ann took two of the kittens and carried them to the house while\r\nMamma Cat carried the other.\r\n\r\nRaggedy Ann wanted to give the kittens her bed, but Fido, who was\r\nanxious to prove his affection, insisted that Mamma Cat and the kittens\r\nshould have his nice soft basket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe dolls could hardly sleep that night; they were so anxious to see\r\nwhat Mistress would say when she found the dear little kittens in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nRaggedy Ann did not sleep a wink, for she shared her bed with Fido and\r\nhe kept her awake whispering to her.\r\n\r\nIn the morning when Marcella came to the nursery, the first thing she\r\nsaw was the three little kittens.\r\n\r\nShe cried out in delight and carried them all down to show to Mamma and\r\nDaddy. Mamma Cat went trailing along, arching her back and purring with\r\npride as she rubbed against all the chairs and doors.\r\n\r\nMamma and Daddy said the kittens could stay in the nursery and belong to\r\nMarcella, so Marcella took them back to Fido\'s basket while she hunted\r\nnames for them out of a fairy tale book.\r\n\r\nMarcella finally decided upon three names; Prince Charming for the white\r\nkitty, Cinderella for the Maltese and Princess Golden for the kitty with\r\nthe yellow stripes.\r\n\r\nSo that is how the three little kittens came to live in the nursery.\r\n\r\nAnd it all turned out just as Raggedy Ann had said, for her head was\r\nstuffed with clean white cotton, and she could think exceedingly wise\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nAnd Mamma Cat found out that Fido was a very good friend, too. She grew\r\nto trust him so much she would even let him help wash the kittens\' faces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGGEDY ANN AND THE FAIRIES\' GIFT\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the dolls were tucked snugly in their little doll-beds for the night\r\nand the large house was very still.\r\n\r\nEvery once in a while Fido would raise one ear and partly open one eye,\r\nfor his keen dog sense seemed to tell him that something was about to\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\nFinally he opened both eyes, sniffed into the air and, getting out of\r\nhis basket and shaking himself, he trotted across the nursery to Raggedy\r\nAnn\'s bed.\r\n\r\nFido put his cold nose in Raggedy Ann\'s neck. She raised her head from\r\nthe little pillow.\r\n\r\n"Oh! It\'s you, Fido!" said Raggedy Ann. "I dreamed the tin soldier put\r\nan icicle down my neck!"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t sleep," Fido told Raggedy Ann. "I feel that something is about\r\nto happen!"\r\n\r\n"You have been eating too many bones lately, Fido, and they keep you\r\nawake," Raggedy replied.\r\n\r\n"No, it isn\'t that. I haven\'t had any bones since the folks had beef\r\nlast Sunday. It isn\'t that. Listen, Raggedy!"\r\n\r\nRaggedy Ann listened.\r\n\r\nThere was a murmur as if someone were singing, far away.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" asked Fido.\r\n\r\n"Sh!" cautioned Raggedy Ann, "It\'s music."\r\n\r\nIt was indeed music, the most beautiful music Raggedy Ann had ever\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nIt grew louder, but still seemed to be _far_ away.\r\n\r\nRaggedy Ann and Fido could hear it distinctly and it sounded as if\r\nhundreds of voices were singing in unison.\r\n\r\n"Please don\'t howl, Fido," Raggedy Ann said as she put her two rag arms\r\naround the dog\'s nose. Fido usually "sang" when he heard music.\r\n\r\nBut Fido did not sing this time; he was filled with wonder. It seemed as\r\nif something very nice was going to happen.\r\n\r\nRaggedy Ann sat upright in bed. The room was flooded with a strange,\r\nbeautiful light and the music came floating in through the nursery\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nRaggedy Ann hopped from her bed and ran across the floor, trailing the\r\nbed clothes behind her. Fido followed close behind and together they\r\nlooked out the window across the flower garden.\r\n\r\nThere among the flowers were hundreds of tiny beings, some playing on\r\ntiny reed instruments and flower horns, while others sang. This was the\r\nstrange, wonderful music Raggedy and Fido had heard.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the Fairies!" said Raggedy Ann. "To your basket quick, Fido! They\r\nare coming this way!" And Raggedy Ann ran back to her bed, with the bed\r\nclothes trailing behind her.\r\n\r\nFido gave three jumps and he was in his basket, pretending he was sound\r\nasleep, but one little black eye was peeping through a chink in the\r\nside.\r\n\r\nRaggedy jumped into her bed and pulled the covers to her chin, but lay\r\nso that her shoe-button eyes could see towards the window.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLittle Fairy forms radiant as silver came flitting into the nursery,\r\nsinging in far away voices. They carried a little bundle. A beautiful\r\nlight came from this bundle, and to Raggedy Ann and Fido it seemed like\r\nsunshine and moonshine mixed. It was a soft mellow light, just the\r\nsort of light you would expect to accompany Fairy Folk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs Raggedy watched, her candy heart went pitty-pat against her cotton\r\nstuffing, for she saw a tiny pink foot sticking out of the bundle of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThe Fairy troop sailed across the nursery and through the door with\r\ntheir bundle and Raggedy Ann and Fido listened to their far away music\r\nas they went down the hall.\r\n\r\nPresently the Fairies returned without the bundle and disappeared\r\nthrough the nursery window.\r\n\r\nRaggedy Ann and Fido again ran to the window and saw the Fairy troop\r\ndancing among the flowers.\r\n\r\nThe light from the bundle still hung about the nursery and a strange\r\nlovely perfume floated about.\r\n\r\nWhen the Fairies\' music ceased and they had flown away, Raggedy Ann and\r\nFido returned to Raggedy\'s bed to think it all out.\r\n\r\nWhen old Mister Sun peeped over the garden wall and into the nursery,\r\nand the other dolls awakened, Raggedy Ann and Fido were still puzzled.\r\n\r\n"What is it, Raggedy Ann?" asked the tin soldier and Uncle Clem, in one\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nBefore Raggedy Ann could answer, Marcella came running into the nursery,\r\ngathered up all the dolls in her arms, and ran down the hall, Fido\r\njumping beside her and barking shrilly.\r\n\r\n"Be quiet!" Marcella said to Fido, "It\'s asleep and you might awaken\r\nit!"\r\n\r\nMamma helped Marcella arrange all the dolls in a circle around the bed\r\nso that they could all see what was in the bundle.\r\n\r\nMamma gently pulled back the soft covering and the dolls saw a tiny\r\nlittle fist as pink as coral, a soft little face with a cunning tiny\r\npink nose, and a little head as bald as the French dolly\'s when her hair\r\ncame off.\r\n\r\nMy, how the dollies all chattered when they were once again left alone\r\nin the nursery!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"A dear cuddly baby brother for Mistress!" said Uncle Clem.\r\n\r\n"A beautiful bundle of love and Fairy Sunshine for everybody in the\r\nhouse!" said Raggedy Ann, as she went to the toy piano and joyously\r\nplayed "Peter-Peter-Pumpkin-Eater" with one rag hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGGEDY ANN AND THE CHICKENS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Marcella was called into the house she left Raggedy sitting on the\r\nchicken yard fence. "Now you sit quietly and do not stir," Marcella told\r\nRaggedy Ann, "If you move you may fall and hurt yourself!"\r\n\r\nSo, Raggedy Ann sat quietly, just as Marcella told her, but she smiled\r\nat the chickens for she had fallen time and again and it had never hurt\r\nher in the least. She was stuffed with nice soft cotton, you see.\r\n\r\nSo, there she sat until a tiny little humming-bird, in search of flower\r\nhoney hummed close to Raggedy Ann\'s head and hovered near the tall\r\nHollyhocks.\r\n\r\nRaggedy Ann turned her rag head to see the humming-bird and lost her\r\nbalance--_plump!_ she went, down amongst the chickens.\r\n\r\nThe chickens scattered in all directions, all except Old Ironsides, the\r\nrooster.\r\n\r\nHe ruffled his neck feathers and put his head down close to the ground,\r\nmaking a queer whistling noise as he looked fiercely at Raggedy Ann.\r\n\r\nBut Raggedy Ann only smiled at Old Ironsides, the rooster, and ran her\r\nrag hand through her yarn hair for she did not fear him.\r\n\r\nAnd then something strange happened, for when she made this motion the\r\nold rooster jumped up in the air and kicked his feet out in front,\r\nknocking Raggedy Ann over and over.\r\n\r\nWhen Raggedy Ann stopped rolling she waved her apron at the rooster and\r\ncried, "Shoo!" but instead of "shooing," Old Ironsides upset her again.\r\n\r\nNow, two old hens who had been watching the rooster jump at Raggedy ran\r\nup and as one old hen placed herself before the rooster, the other old\r\nhen caught hold of Raggedy\'s apron and dragged her into the\r\nchicken-coop.\r\n\r\nIt was dark inside and Raggedy could not tell what was going on as she\r\nfelt herself being pulled up over the nests.\r\n\r\nBut, finally Raggedy could sit up, for the old hen had quit pulling her,\r\nand as her shoe-button eyes were very good, she soon made out the shape\r\nof the old hen in front of her.\r\n\r\n"My! that\'s the hardest work I have done in a long time!" said the old\r\nhen, when she could catch her breath. "I was afraid Mr. Rooster would\r\ntear your dress and apron!"\r\n\r\n"That was a queer game he was playing, Mrs. Hen," said Raggedy Ann.\r\n\r\nThe old hen chuckled \'way down in her throat, "Gracious me! He wasn\'t\r\nplaying a game, he was fighting you!"\r\n\r\n"Fighting!" cried Raggedy Ann in surprise.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, indeed!" the old hen answered, "Old Ironsides, the rooster,\r\nthought you intended to harm some of the children chickens and he was\r\nfighting you!"\r\n\r\n"I am sorry that I fell inside the pen, I wouldn\'t harm anything,"\r\nRaggedy Ann said.\r\n\r\n"If we tell you a secret you must promise not to tell your mistress!"\r\nsaid the old hens.\r\n\r\n"I promise! Cross my candy heart!" said Raggedy Ann.\r\n\r\nThen the two old hens took Raggedy Ann \'way back in the farthest corner\r\nof the chicken coop. There, in back of a box, they had built two nests\r\nand each old hen had ten eggs in her nest.\r\n\r\n"If your folks hear of it they will take the eggs!" said the hens, "and\r\nthen we could not raise our families!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nRaggedy Ann felt the eggs and they were nice and warm.\r\n\r\n"We just left the nests when you fell into the pen!" explained the old\r\nhens.\r\n\r\n"But how can the eggs grow if you sit upon them?" said Raggedy. "If Fido\r\nsits on any of the garden, the plants will not grow, Mistress says!"\r\n\r\n"Eggs are different!" one old hen explained. "In order to make the eggs\r\nhatch properly, we must sit on them three weeks and not let them get\r\ncold at any time!"\r\n\r\n"And at the end of the three weeks do the eggs sprout?" asked Raggedy\r\nAnn.\r\n\r\n"You must be thinking of eggplant!" cried one old hen. "These eggs hatch\r\nat the end of three weeks--they don\'t sprout--and then we have a lovely\r\nfamily of soft downy chickies; little puff balls that we can cuddle\r\nunder our wings and love dearly!"\r\n\r\n"Have you been sitting upon the eggs very long?" Raggedy asked.\r\n\r\n"Neither one of us has kept track of the time," said one hen. "So we do\r\nnot know! You see, we never leave the nests only just once in a while to\r\nget a drink and to eat a little. So we can hardly tell when it is day\r\nand when it is night."\r\n\r\n"We were going out to get a drink when you fell in the pen!" said one\r\nold hen. "Now we will have to sit upon the eggs and warm them up again!"\r\n\r\nThe two old hens spread their feathers and nestled down upon the nests.\r\n\r\n"When you get them good and warm, I would be glad to sit upon the eggs\r\nto keep them warm until you get something to eat and drink!" said\r\nRaggedy. So the two old hens walked out of the coop to finish their meal\r\nwhich had been interrupted by Raggedy\'s fall and while they were gone,\r\nRaggedy Ann sat quietly upon the warm eggs. Suddenly down beneath her\r\nshe heard something go, "Pick, pick!" "I hope it isn\'t a mouse!" Raggedy\r\nAnn said to herself, when she felt something move. "I wish the old hens\r\nwould come back." But when they came back and saw the puzzled expression\r\non her face, they cried, "What is it?"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nRaggedy Ann got to her feet and looked down and there were several\r\nlittle fluffy, cuddly baby chickies, round as little puff-balls.\r\n\r\n"Cheep! Cheep! Cheep!" they cried when Raggedy stepped out of the nest.\r\n\r\n"Baby Chicks!" Raggedy cried, as she stooped and picked up one of the\r\nlittle puff-balls. "They want to be cuddled!"\r\n\r\nThe two old hens, their eyes shining with happiness, got upon the nests\r\nand spread out their soft warm feathers, "The other eggs will hatch\r\nsoon!" said they.\r\n\r\nSo, for several days Raggedy helped the two hens hatch out the rest of\r\nthe chickies and just as they finished, Marcella came inside looking\r\naround.\r\n\r\n"How in the world did you get in here, Raggedy Ann?" she cried. "I have\r\nbeen looking all about for you! Did the chickens drag you in here?"\r\n\r\nBoth old hens down behind the box clucked softly to the chickies beneath\r\nthem and Marcella overheard them.\r\n\r\nShe lifted the box away and gave a little squeal of surprise and\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n"Oh you dear old Hennypennies!" she cried, lifting both old hens from\r\ntheir nests. "You have hidden your nests away back here and now you have\r\none, two, three, four--twenty chickies!" and as she counted them,\r\nMarcella placed them in her apron; then catching up Raggedy Ann, she\r\nplaced her over the new little chickies.\r\n\r\n"Come on, old Hennypennies!" she said, and went out of the coop with the\r\ntwo old hens clucking at her heels.\r\n\r\nMarcella called Daddy and Daddy rolled two barrels out under one of the\r\ntrees and made a nice bed in each. Then he nailed slats across the\r\nfront, leaving a place for a door. Each Hennypennie was then given ten\r\nlittle chickies and shut up in the barrel. And all the dolls were happy\r\nwhen they heard of Raggedy\'s adventure and they did not have to wait\r\nlong before they were all taken out to see the new chickies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGGEDY ANN AND THE MOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nJeanette was a new wax doll, and like Henny, the Dutch doll, she could\r\nsay "Mamma" when anyone tipped her backward or forward. She had lovely\r\ngolden brown curls of real hair. It could be combed and braided, or\r\ncurled or fluffed without tangling, and Raggedy Ann was very proud when\r\nJeanette came to live with the dolls.\r\n\r\nBut now Raggedy Ann was very angry--in fact, Raggedy Ann had just ripped\r\ntwo stitches out of the top of her head when she took her rag hands and\r\npulled her rag face down into a frown (but when she let go of the frown\r\nher face stretched right back into her usual cheery smile).\r\n\r\nAnd _you_ would have been angry, too, for something had happened to\r\nJeanette.\r\n\r\nSomething or someone had stolen into the nursery that night when the\r\ndolls were asleep and nibbled all the wax from Jeanette\'s beautiful\r\nface--and now all her beauty was gone!\r\n\r\n"It really is a shame!" said Raggedy Ann as she put her arms about\r\nJeanette.\r\n\r\n"Something must be done about it!" said the French doll as she stamped\r\nher little foot.\r\n\r\n"If I catch the culprit, I will--well, I don\'t know what I will do with\r\nhim!" said the tin soldier, who could be very fierce at times, although\r\nhe was seldom cross.\r\n\r\n"Here is the hole he came from!" cried Uncle Clem from the other end of\r\nthe nursery. "Come, see!"\r\n\r\nAll the dolls ran to where Uncle Clem was, down on his hands and knees.\r\n\r\n"This must be the place!" said Raggedy Ann. "We will plug up the hole\r\nwith something, so he will not come out again!"\r\n\r\nThe dolls hunted around and brought rags and pieces of paper and pushed\r\nthem into the mouse\'s doorway.\r\n\r\n"I thought I heard nibbling last night," one of the penny dolls said.\r\n"You know I begged for an extra piece of pie last evening, when Mistress\r\nhad me at the table and it kept me awake!"\r\n\r\nWhile the dolls were talking, Marcella ran down-stairs with Jeanette and\r\ntold Daddy and Mamma, who came up-stairs with Marcella and hunted around\r\nuntil they discovered the mouse\'s doorway.\r\n\r\n"Oh, why couldn\'t it have chewed on me?" Raggedy Ann asked herself when\r\nshe saw Marcella\'s sorrowful face, for Raggedy Ann was never selfish.\r\n\r\n"Daddy will take Jeanette down-town with him and have her fixed up as\r\ngood as new," said Mamma, so Jeanette was wrapped in soft tissue paper\r\nand taken away.\r\n\r\nLater in the day Marcella came bouncing into the nursery with a surprise\r\nfor the dolls. It was a dear fuzzy little kitten.\r\n\r\nMarcella introduced the kitten to all the dolls.\r\n\r\n"Her name is Boots, because she has four little white feet!" said\r\nMarcella. So Boots, the happy little creature, played with the penny\r\ndolls, scraping them over the floor and peeping out from behind chairs\r\nand pouncing upon them as if they were mice and the penny dolls enjoyed\r\nit hugely.\r\n\r\nWhen Marcella was not in the nursery, Raggedy Ann wrestled with Boots\r\nand they would roll over and over upon the floor, Boots with her front\r\nfeet around Raggedy Ann\'s neck and kicking with her hind feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThen Boots would arch her back and pretend she was very angry and walk\r\nsideways until she was close to Raggedy. Then she would jump at her and\r\nover and over they would roll, their heads hitting the floor\r\nbumpity-bump.\r\n\r\nBoots slept in the nursery that night and was lonely for her Mamma, for\r\nit was the first time she had been away from home.\r\n\r\nEven though her bed was right on top of Raggedy Ann, she could not\r\nsleep. But Raggedy Ann was very glad to have Boots sleep with her, even\r\nif she was heavy, and when Boots began crying for her Mamma, Raggedy Ann\r\ncomforted her and soon Boots went to sleep.\r\n\r\nOne day Jeanette came home. She had a new coating of wax on her face and\r\nshe was as beautiful as ever.\r\n\r\nNow, by this time Boots was one of the family and did not cry at night.\r\nBesides Boots was told of the mouse in the corner and how he had eaten\r\nJeanette\'s wax, so she promised to sleep with one eye open.\r\n\r\nLate that night when Boots was the only one awake, out popped a tiny\r\nmouse from the hole. Boots jumped after the mouse, and hit against the\r\ntoy piano and made the keys tinkle so loudly it awakened the dolls.\r\n\r\nThey ran over to where Boots sat growling with the tiny mouse in her\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nMy! how the mouse was squeaking!\r\n\r\nRaggedy Ann did not like to hear it squeak, but she did not wish\r\nJeanette to have her wax face chewed again, either.\r\n\r\nSo, Raggedy Ann said to the tiny little mouse, "You should have known\r\nbetter than to come here when Boots is with us. Why don\'t you go out in\r\nthe barn and live where you will not destroy anything of value?"\r\n\r\n"I did not know!" squeaked the little mouse, "This is the first time I\r\nhave ever been here!"\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you the little mouse who nibbled Jeanette\'s wax face?" Raggedy\r\nAnn asked.\r\n\r\n"No!" the little mouse answered. "I was visiting the mice inside the\r\nwalls and wandered out here to pick up cake crumbs! I have three little\r\nbaby mice at home down in the barn. I have never nibbled at anyone\'s wax\r\nface!"\r\n\r\n"Are you a Mamma mouse?" Uncle Clem asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes!" the little mouse squeaked, "and if the kitten will let me go I\r\nwill run right home to my children and never return again!"\r\n\r\n"Let her go, Boots!" the dolls all cried, "She has three little baby\r\nmice at home! Please let her go!"\r\n\r\n"No, sir!" Boots growled, "This is the first mouse I have ever caught\r\nand I will eat her!" At this the little Mamma mouse began squeaking\r\nlouder than ever.\r\n\r\n"If you do not let the Mamma mouse go, Boots, I shall not play with you\r\nagain!" said Raggedy Ann.\r\n\r\n"Raggedy will not play with Boots again!" said all of the dolls in an\r\nawed tone. Not to have Raggedy play with them would have been sad,\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nBut Boots only growled.\r\n\r\nThe dolls drew to one side, where Raggedy Ann and Uncle Clem whispered\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nAnd while they whispered Boots would let the little Mamma mouse run a\r\npiece, then she would catch it again and box it about between her paws.\r\n\r\nThis she did until the poor little Mamma mouse grew so tired it could\r\nscarcely run away from Boots.\r\n\r\nBoots would let it get almost to the hole in the wall before she would\r\ncatch it, for she knew it would not escape her.\r\n\r\nAs she watched the little mouse crawling towards the hole scarcely able\r\nto move, Raggedy Ann could not keep the tears from her shoe-button eyes.\r\n\r\nFinally as Boots started to spring after the little mouse again, Raggedy\r\nAnn threw her rag arms around the kitten\'s neck. "Run, Mamma mouse!"\r\nRaggedy Ann cried, as Boots whirled her over and over.\r\n\r\nUncle Clem ran and pushed the Mamma mouse into the hole and then she was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nWhen Raggedy Ann took her arms from around Boots, the kitten was very\r\nangry. She laid her ears back and scratched Raggedy Ann with her claws.\r\n\r\nBut Raggedy Ann only smiled--it did not hurt her a bit for Raggedy was\r\nsewed together with a needle and thread and if that did not hurt, how\r\ncould the scratch of a kitten? Finally Boots felt ashamed of herself and\r\nwent over and lay down by the hole in the wall in hopes the mouse would\r\nreturn, but the mouse never returned. Even then Mamma mouse was out in\r\nthe barn with her children, warning them to beware of kittens and cats.\r\n\r\nRaggedy Ann and all the dolls then went to bed and Raggedy had just\r\ndozed off to sleep when she felt something jump upon her bed. It was\r\nBoots. She felt a warm little pink tongue caress her rag cheek. Raggedy\r\nAnn smiled happily to herself, for Boots had curled up on top of Raggedy\r\nAnn and was purring herself to sleep.\r\n\r\nThen Raggedy Ann knew she had been forgiven for rescuing the Mamma mouse\r\nand she smiled herself to sleep and dreamed happily of tomorrow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGGEDY ANN\'S NEW SISTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nMarcella was having a tea party up in the nursery when Daddy called to\r\nher, so she left the dollies sitting around the tiny table and ran down\r\nstairs carrying Raggedy Ann with her.\r\n\r\nMama, Daddy and a strange man were talking in the living room and Daddy\r\nintroduced Marcella to the stranger.\r\n\r\nThe stranger was a large man with kindly eyes and a cheery smile, as\r\npleasant as Raggedy Ann\'s.\r\n\r\nHe took Marcella upon his knee and ran his fingers through her curls as\r\nhe talked to Daddy and Mamma, so, of course, Raggedy Ann liked him from\r\nthe beginning. "I have two little girls," he told Marcella. "Their names\r\nare Virginia and Doris, and one time when we were at the sea-shore they\r\nwere playing in the sand and they covered up Freddy, Doris\' boy-doll in\r\nthe sand. They were playing that Freddy was in bathing and that he\r\nwanted to be covered with the clean white sand, just as the other\r\nbathers did. And when they had covered Freddy they took their little\r\npails and shovels and went farther down the beach to play and forgot all\r\nabout Freddy.\r\n\r\n"Now when it came time for us to go home, Virginia and Doris remembered\r\nFreddy and ran down to get him, but the tide had come in and Freddy was\r\n\'way out under the water and they could not find him. Virginia and\r\nDoris were very sad and they talked of Freddy all the way home."\r\n\r\n"It was too bad they forgot Freddy," said Marcella.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed it was!" the new friend replied as he took Raggedy Ann up\r\nand made her dance on Marcella\'s knee. "But it turned out all right\r\nafter all, for do you know what happened to Freddy?"\r\n\r\n"No, what did happen to him?" Marcella asked.\r\n\r\n"Well, first of all, when Freddy was covered with the sand, he enjoyed\r\nit immensely. And he did not mind it so much when the tide came up over\r\nhim, for he felt Virginia and Doris would return and get him.\r\n\r\n"But presently Freddy felt the sand above him move as if someone was\r\ndigging him out. Soon his head was uncovered and he could look right up\r\nthrough the pretty green water, and what do you think was happening? The\r\nTide Fairies were uncovering Freddy!\r\n\r\n"When he was completely uncovered, the Tide Fairies swam with Freddy\r\n\'way out to the Undertow Fairies. The Undertow Fairies took Freddy and\r\nswam with him \'way out to the Roller Fairies. The Roller Fairies carried\r\nFreddy up to the surface and tossed him up to the Spray Fairies who\r\ncarried him to the Wind Fairies."\r\n\r\n"And the Wind Fairies?" Marcella asked breathlessly.\r\n\r\n"The Wind Fairies carried Freddy right to our garden and there Virginia\r\nand Doris found him, none the worse for his wonderful adventure!"\r\n\r\n"Freddy must have enjoyed it and your little girls must have been very\r\nglad to get Freddy back again!" said Marcella. "Raggedy Ann went up in\r\nthe air on the tail of a kite one day and fell and was lost, so now I am\r\nvery careful with her!"\r\n\r\n"Would you let me take Raggedy Ann for a few days?" asked the new\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nMarcella was silent. She liked the stranger friend, but she did not wish\r\nto lose Raggedy Ann.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"I will promise to take very good care of her and return her to you in a\r\nweek. Will you let her go with me, Marcella?"\r\n\r\nMarcella finally agreed and when the stranger friend left, he placed\r\nRaggedy Ann in his grip.\r\n\r\n"It is lonely without Raggedy Ann!" said the dollies each night.\r\n\r\n"We miss her happy painted smile and her cheery ways!" they said.\r\n\r\nAnd so the week dragged by....\r\n\r\nBut, my! What a chatter there was in the nursery the first night after\r\nRaggedy Ann returned. All the dolls were so anxious to hug Raggedy Ann\r\nthey could scarcely wait until Marcella had left them alone.\r\n\r\nWhen they had squeezed Raggedy Ann almost out of shape and she had\r\nsmoothed out her yarn hair, patted her apron out and felt her\r\nshoe-button eyes to see if they were still there, she said, "Well, what\r\nhave you been doing? Tell me all the news!"\r\n\r\n"Oh we have just had the usual tea parties and games!" said the tin\r\nsoldier. "Tell us about yourself, Raggedy dear, we have missed you so\r\nmuch!"\r\n\r\n"Yes! Tell us where you have been and what you have done, Raggedy!" all\r\nthe dolls cried.\r\n\r\nBut Raggedy Ann just then noticed that one of the penny dolls had a hand\r\nmissing.\r\n\r\n"How did this happen?" she asked as she picked up the doll.\r\n\r\n"I fell off the table and lit upon the tin soldier last night when we\r\nwere playing. But don\'t mind a little thing like that, Raggedy Ann,"\r\nreplied the penny doll. "Tell us of yourself! Have you had a nice time?"\r\n\r\n"I shall not tell a thing until your hand is mended!" Raggedy Ann said.\r\n\r\nSo the Indian ran and brought a bottle of glue. "Where\'s the hand?"\r\nRaggedy asked.\r\n\r\n"In my pocket," the penny doll answered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen Raggedy Ann had glued the penny doll\'s hand in place and wrapped\r\na rag around it to hold it until the glue dried, she said, "When I tell\r\nyou of this wonderful adventure, I know you will all feel very happy.\r\nIt has made me almost burst my stitches with joy."\r\n\r\nThe dolls all sat upon the floor around Raggedy Ann, the tin soldier\r\nwith his arm over her shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Well, first when I left," said Raggedy Ann, "I was placed in the\r\nStranger Friend\'s grip. It was rather stuffy in there, but I did not\r\nmind it; in fact I believe I must have fallen asleep, for when I\r\nawakened I saw the Stranger Friend\'s hand reaching into the grip. Then\r\nhe lifted me from the grip and danced me upon his knee. \'What do you\r\nthink of her?\' he asked to three other men sitting nearby.\r\n\r\n"I was so interested in looking out of the window I did not pay any\r\nattention to what they said, for we were on a train and the scenery was\r\njust flying by! Then I was put back in the grip.\r\n\r\n"When next I was taken from the grip I was in a large, clean, light room\r\nand there were many, many girls all dressed in white aprons.\r\n\r\n"The stranger friend showed me to another man and to the girls who took\r\noff my clothes, cut my seams and took out my cotton. And what do you\r\nthink! They found my lovely candy heart had not melted at all as I\r\nthought. Then they laid me on a table and marked all around my outside\r\nedges with a pencil on clean white cloth, and then the girls re-stuffed\r\nme and dressed me.\r\n\r\n"I stayed in the clean big light room for two or three days and nights\r\nand watched my Sisters grow from pieces of cloth into rag dolls just\r\nlike myself!"\r\n\r\n"Your SISTERS!" the dolls all exclaimed in astonishment, "What do you\r\nmean, Raggedy?"\r\n\r\n"I mean," said Raggedy Ann, "that the Stranger Friend had borrowed me\r\nfrom Marcella so that he could have patterns made from me. And before I\r\nleft the big clean white room there where hundreds of rag dolls so like\r\nme you would not have been able to tell us apart."\r\n\r\n"We could have told _you_ by your happy smile!" cried the French dolly.\r\n\r\n"But all of my sister dolls have smiles just like mine!" replied Raggedy\r\nAnn.\r\n\r\n"And shoe-button eyes?" the dolls all asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, shoe-button eyes!" Raggedy Ann replied.\r\n\r\n"I would tell you from the others by your dress, Raggedy Ann," said the\r\nFrench doll, "Your dress is fifty years old! I could tell you by that!"\r\n\r\n"But my new sister rag dolls have dresses just like mine, for the\r\nStranger Friend had cloth made especially for them exactly like mine."\r\n\r\n"I know how we could tell you from the other rag dolls, even if you all\r\nlook exactly alike!" said the Indian doll, who had been thinking for a\r\nlong time.\r\n\r\n"How?" asked Raggedy Ann with a laugh.\r\n\r\n"By feeling your candy heart! If the doll has a candy heart then it is\r\nyou, Raggedy Ann!"\r\n\r\nRaggedy Ann laughed, "I am so glad you all love me as you do, but I am\r\nsure you would not be able to tell me from my new sisters, except that I\r\nam more worn, for each new rag doll has a candy heart, and on it is\r\nwritten, \'_I love you_\' just as is written on my own candy heart."\r\n\r\n"And there are hundreds and hundreds of the new rag dolls?" asked the\r\nlittle penny dolls.\r\n\r\n"Hundreds and hundreds of them, all named Raggedy Ann," replied Raggedy.\r\n\r\n"Then," said the penny dolls, "we are indeed happy and proud for you!\r\nFor wherever one of the new Raggedy Ann dolls goes there will go with it\r\nthe love and happiness that _you_ give to others."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Notes:\r\n\r\nThere are a few variations in hyphenation between the introduction and\r\nthe stories themselves.\r\n\r\n"Today" and "downstairs" occur in the introduction, while "to-day" and\r\n"down-stairs" are in the stories.\r\n\r\nChicken coop is spelled once with and once without the hyphen.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Raggedy Ann Stories, by Johnny Gruelle\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK RAGGEDY ANN STORIES ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 18190.txt or 18190.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/8/1/9/18190/\r\n\r\nProduced by Suzanne Shell and the Online Distributed\r\nProofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\r\n\r\n'
