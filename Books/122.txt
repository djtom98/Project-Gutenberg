Overhead the hollow stretch of whitish cloud\r\nshutting out the sky was as a tent which had the whole heath for its\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nThe heaven being spread with this pallid screen and the earth with the\r\ndarkest vegetation, their meeting-line at the horizon was clearly\r\nmarked. In such contrast the heath wore the appearance of an instalment\r\nof night which had taken up its place before its astronomical hour was\r\ncome: darkness had to a great extent arrived hereon, while day stood\r\ndistinct in the sky. Looking upwards, a furze-cutter would have been\r\ninclined to continue work; looking down, he would have decided to\r\nfinish his faggot and go home. The distant rims of the world and of the\r\nfirmament seemed to be a division in time no less than a division in\r\nmatter. The face of the heath by its mere complexion added half an hour\r\nto evening; it could in like manner retard the dawn, sadden noon,\r\nanticipate the frowning of storms scarcely generated, and intensify the\r\nopacity of a moonless midnight to a cause of shaking and dread.\r\n\r\nIn fact, precisely at this transitional point of its nightly roll into\r\ndarkness the great and particular glory of the Egdon waste began, and\r\nnobody could be said to understand the heath who had not been there at\r\nsuch a time. It could best be felt when it could not clearly be seen,\r\nits complete effect and explanation lying in this and the succeeding\r\nhours before the next dawn; then, and only then, did it tell its true\r\ntale. The spot was, indeed, a near relation of night, and when night\r\nshowed itself an apparent tendency to gravitate together could be\r\nperceived in its shades and the scene. The sombre stretch of rounds and\r\nhollows seemed to rise and meet the evening gloom in pure sympathy, the\r\nheath exhaling darkness as rapidly as the heavens precipitated it. And\r\nso the obscurity in the air and the obscurity in the land closed\r\ntogether in a black fraternization towards which each advanced halfway.\r\n\r\nThe place became full of a watchful intentness now; for when other\r\nthings sank brooding to sleep the heath appeared slowly to awake and\r\nlisten. Every night its Titanic form seemed to await something; but it\r\nhad waited thus, unmoved, during so many centuries, through the crises\r\nof so many things, that it could only be imagined to await one last\r\ncrisis\xe2\x80\x94the final overthrow.\r\n\r\nIt was a spot which returned upon the memory of those who loved it with\r\nan aspect of peculiar and kindly congruity. Smiling champaigns of\r\nflowers and fruit hardly do this, for they are permanently harmonious\r\nonly with an existence of better reputation as to its issues than the\r\npresent. Twilight combined with the scenery of Egdon Heath to evolve a\r\nthing majestic without severity, impressive without showiness, emphatic\r\nin its admonitions, grand in its simplicity. The qualifications which\r\nfrequently invest the fa\xc3\xa7ade of a prison with far more dignity than is\r\nfound in the fa\xc3\xa7ade of a palace double its size lent to this heath a\r\nsublimity in which spots renowned for beauty of the accepted kind are\r\nutterly wanting. Fair prospects wed happily with fair times; but alas,\r\nif times be not fair! Men have oftener suffered from, the mockery of a\r\nplace too smiling for their reason than from the oppression of\r\nsurroundings oversadly tinged. Haggard Egdon appealed to a subtler and\r\nscarcer instinct, to a more recently learnt emotion, than that which\r\nresponds to the sort of beauty called charming and fair.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is a question if the exclusive reign of this orthodox beauty\r\nis not approaching its last quarter. The new Vale of Tempe may be a\r\ngaunt waste in Thule; human souls may find themselves in closer and\r\ncloser harmony with external things wearing a sombreness distasteful to\r\nour race when it was young. The time seems near, if it has not actually\r\narrived, when the chastened sublimity of a moor, a sea, or a mountain\r\nwill be all of nature that is absolutely in keeping with the moods of\r\nthe more thinking among mankind. And ultimately, to the commonest\r\ntourist, spots like Iceland may become what the vineyards and myrtle\r\ngardens of South Europe are to him now; and Heidelberg and Baden be\r\npassed unheeded as he hastens from the Alps to the sand dunes of\r\nScheveningen.\r\n\r\nThe most thoroughgoing ascetic could feel that he had a natural right\r\nto wander on Egdon\xe2\x80\x94he was keeping within the line of legitimate\r\nindulgence when he laid himself open to influences such as these.\r\nColours and beauties so far subdued were, at least, the birthright of\r\nall. Only in summer days of highest feather did its mood touch the\r\nlevel of gaiety. Intensity was more usually reached by way of the\r\nsolemn than by way of the brilliant, and such a sort of intensity was\r\noften arrived at during winter darkness, tempests, and mists. Then\r\nEgdon was aroused to reciprocity; for the storm was its lover, and the\r\nwind its friend. Then it became the home of strange phantoms; and it\r\nwas found to be the hitherto unrecognized original of those wild\r\nregions of obscurity which are vaguely felt to be compassing us about\r\nin midnight dreams of flight and disaster, and are never thought of\r\nafter the dream till revived by scenes like this.\r\n\r\nIt was at present a place perfectly accordant with man\xe2\x80\x99s nature\xe2\x80\x94neither\r\nghastly, hateful, nor ugly; neither commonplace, unmeaning, nor tame;\r\nbut, like man, slighted and enduring; and withal singularly colossal\r\nand mysterious in its swarthy monotony. As with some persons who have\r\nlong lived apart, solitude seemed to look out of its countenance. It\r\nhad a lonely face, suggesting tragical possibilities.\r\n\r\nThis obscure, obsolete, superseded country figures in Domesday. Its\r\ncondition is recorded therein as that of heathy, furzy, briary\r\nwilderness\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBruaria.\xe2\x80\x9d Then follows the length and breadth in leagues;\r\nand, though some uncertainty exists as to the exact extent of this\r\nancient lineal measure, it appears from the figures that the area of\r\nEgdon down to the present day has but little diminished. \xe2\x80\x9cTurbaria\r\nBruaria\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the right of cutting heath-turf\xe2\x80\x94occurs in charters relating to\r\nthe district. \xe2\x80\x9cOvergrown with heth and mosse,\xe2\x80\x9d says Leland of the same\r\ndark sweep of country.\r\n\r\nHere at least were intelligible facts regarding landscape\xe2\x80\x94far-reaching\r\nproofs productive of genuine satisfaction. The untameable, Ishmaelitish\r\nthing that Egdon now was it always had been. Civilization was its\r\nenemy; and ever since the beginning of vegetation its soil had worn the\r\nsame antique brown dress, the natural and invariable garment of the\r\nparticular formation. In its venerable one coat lay a certain vein of\r\nsatire on human vanity in clothes. A person on a heath in raiment of\r\nmodern cut and colours has more or less an anomalous look. We seem to\r\nwant the oldest and simplest human clothing where the clothing of the\r\nearth is so primitive.\r\n\r\nTo recline on a stump of thorn in the central valley of Egdon, between\r\nafternoon and night, as now, where the eye could reach nothing of the\r\nworld outside the summits and shoulders of heathland which filled the\r\nwhole circumference of its glance, and to know that everything around\r\nand underneath had been from prehistoric times as unaltered as the\r\nstars overhead, gave ballast to the mind adrift on change, and harassed\r\nby the irrepressible New. The great inviolate place had an ancient\r\npermanence which the sea cannot claim. Who can say of a particular sea\r\nthat it is old? Distilled by the sun, kneaded by the moon, it is\r\nrenewed in a year, in a day, or in an hour. The sea changed, the fields\r\nchanged, the rivers, the villages, and the people changed, yet Egdon\r\nremained. Those surfaces were neither so steep as to be destructible by\r\nweather, nor so flat as to be the victims of floods and deposits. With\r\nthe exception of an aged highway, and a still more aged barrow\r\npresently to be referred to\xe2\x80\x94themselves almost crystallized to natural\r\nproducts by long continuance\xe2\x80\x94even the trifling irregularities were not\r\ncaused by pickaxe, plough, or spade, but remained as the very\r\nfinger-touches of the last geological change.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned highway traversed the lower levels of the heath,\r\nfrom one horizon to another. In many portions of its course it overlaid\r\nan old vicinal way, which branched from the great Western road of the\r\nRomans, the Via Iceniana, or Ikenild Street, hard by. On the evening\r\nunder consideration it would have been noticed that, though the gloom\r\nhad increased sufficiently to confuse the minor features of the heath,\r\nthe white surface of the road remained almost as clear as ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\nHumanity Appears upon the Scene, Hand in Hand with Trouble\r\n\r\n\r\nAlong the road walked an old man. He was white-headed as a mountain,\r\nbowed in the shoulders, and faded in general aspect. He wore a glazed\r\nhat, an ancient boat-cloak, and shoes; his brass buttons bearing an\r\nanchor upon their face. In his hand was a silver-headed walking stick,\r\nwhich he used as a veritable third leg, perseveringly dotting the\r\nground with its point at every few inches\xe2\x80\x99 interval. One would have\r\nsaid that he had been, in his day, a naval officer of some sort or\r\nother.\r\n\r\nBefore him stretched the long, laborious road, dry, empty, and white.\r\nIt was quite open to the heath on each side, and bisected that vast\r\ndark surface like the parting-line on a head of black hair, diminishing\r\nand bending away on the furthest horizon.\r\n\r\nThe old man frequently stretched his eyes ahead to gaze over the tract\r\nthat he had yet to traverse. At length he discerned, a long distance in\r\nfront of him, a moving spot, which appeared to be a vehicle, and it\r\nproved to be going the same way as that in which he himself was\r\njourneying. It was the single atom of life that the scene contained,\r\nand it only served to render the general loneliness more evident. Its\r\nrate of advance was slow, and the old man gained upon it sensibly.\r\n\r\nWhen he drew nearer he perceived it to be a spring van, ordinary in\r\nshape, but singular in colour, this being a lurid red. The driver\r\nwalked beside it; and, like his van, he was completely red. One dye of\r\nthat tincture covered his clothes, the cap upon his head, his boots,\r\nhis face, and his hands. He was not temporarily overlaid with the\r\ncolour; it permeated him.\r\n\r\nThe old man knew the meaning of this. The traveller with the cart was a\r\nreddleman\xe2\x80\x94a person whose vocation it was to supply farmers with redding\r\nfor their sheep. He was one of a class rapidly becoming extinct in\r\nWessex, filling at present in the rural world the place which, during\r\nthe last century, the dodo occupied in the world of animals. He is a\r\ncurious, interesting, and nearly perished link between obsolete forms\r\nof life and those which generally prevail.\r\n\r\nThe decayed officer, by degrees, came up alongside his fellow-wayfarer,\r\nand wished him good evening. The reddleman turned his head, and replied\r\nin sad and occupied tones. He was young, and his face, if not exactly\r\nhandsome, approached so near to handsome that nobody would have\r\ncontradicted an assertion that it really was so in its natural colour.\r\nHis eye, which glared so strangely through his stain, was in itself\r\nattractive\xe2\x80\x94keen as that of a bird of prey, and blue as autumn mist. He\r\nhad neither whisker nor moustache, which allowed the soft curves of the\r\nlower part of his face to be apparent. His lips were thin, and though,\r\nas it seemed, compressed by thought, there was a pleasant twitch at\r\ntheir corners now and then. He was clothed throughout in a\r\ntight-fitting suit of corduroy, excellent in quality, not much worn,\r\nand well-chosen for its purpose, but deprived of its original colour by\r\nhis trade. It showed to advantage the good shape of his figure. A\r\ncertain well-to-do air about the man suggested that he was not poor for\r\nhis degree. The natural query of an observer would have been, Why\r\nshould such a promising being as this have hidden his prepossessing\r\nexterior by adopting that singular occupation?\r\n\r\nAfter replying to the old man\xe2\x80\x99s greeting he showed no inclination to\r\ncontinue in talk, although they still walked side by side, for the\r\nelder traveller seemed to desire company. There were no sounds but that\r\nof the booming wind upon the stretch of tawny herbage around them, the\r\ncrackling wheels, the tread of the men, and the footsteps of the two\r\nshaggy ponies which drew the van. They were small, hardy animals, of a\r\nbreed between Galloway and Exmoor, and were known as \xe2\x80\x9cheath-croppers\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nNow, as they thus pursued their way, the reddleman occasionally left\r\nhis companion\xe2\x80\x99s side, and, stepping behind the van, looked into its\r\ninterior through a small window. The look was always anxious. He would\r\nthen return to the old man, who made another remark about the state of\r\nthe country and so on, to which the reddleman again abstractedly\r\nreplied, and then again they would lapse into silence. The silence\r\nconveyed to neither any sense of awkwardness; in these lonely places\r\nwayfarers, after a first greeting, frequently plod on for miles without\r\nspeech; contiguity amounts to a tacit conversation where, otherwise\r\nthan in cities, such contiguity can be put an end to on the merest\r\ninclination, and where not to put an end to it is intercourse in\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nPossibly these two might not have spoken again till their parting, had\r\nit not been for the reddleman\xe2\x80\x99s visits to his van. When he returned\r\nfrom his fifth time of looking in the old man said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have something\r\ninside there besides your load?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody who wants looking after?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot long after this a faint cry sounded from the interior. The\r\nreddleman hastened to the back, looked in, and came away again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a child there, my man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, I have a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deuce you have! Why did she cry out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she has fallen asleep, and not being used to traveling, she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nuneasy, and keeps dreaming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA young woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a young woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would have interested me forty years ago. Perhaps she\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\nwife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife!\xe2\x80\x9d said the other bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s above mating with such as I.\r\nBut there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why I should tell you about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true. And there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why you should not. What harm can I\r\ndo to you or to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reddleman looked in the old man\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at\r\nlast, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew her before today, though perhaps it would have been\r\nbetter if I had not. But she\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to me, and I am nothing to her;\r\nand she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been in my van if any better carriage had been\r\nthere to take her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere, may I ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt Anglebury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know the town well. What was she doing there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, not much\xe2\x80\x94to gossip about. However, she\xe2\x80\x99s tired to death now, and\r\nnot at all well, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what makes her so restless. She dropped off\r\ninto a nap about an hour ago, and \xe2\x80\x99twill do her good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA nice-looking girl, no doubt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other traveller turned his eyes with interest towards the van\r\nwindow, and, without withdrawing them, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI presume I might look in\r\nupon her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reddleman abruptly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is getting too dark for you to\r\nsee much of her; and, more than that, I have no right to allow you.\r\nThank God she sleeps so well, I hope she won\xe2\x80\x99t wake till she\xe2\x80\x99s home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is she? One of the neighbourhood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis no matter who, excuse me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not that girl of Blooms-End, who has been talked about more or\r\nless lately? If so, I know her; and I can guess what has happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis no matter.... Now, sir, I am sorry to say that we shall soon have\r\nto part company. My ponies are tired, and I have further to go, and I\r\nam going to rest them under this bank for an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe elder traveller nodded his head indifferently, and the reddleman\r\nturned his horses and van in upon the turf, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cGood night.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nold man replied, and proceeded on his way as before.\r\n\r\nThe reddleman watched his form as it diminished to a speck on the road\r\nand became absorbed in the thickening films of night. He then took some\r\nhay from a truss which was slung up under the van, and, throwing a\r\nportion of it in front of the horses, made a pad of the rest, which he\r\nlaid on the ground beside his vehicle. Upon this he sat down, leaning\r\nhis back against the wheel. From the interior a low soft breathing came\r\nto his ear. It appeared to satisfy him, and he musingly surveyed the\r\nscene, as if considering the next step that he should take.\r\n\r\nTo do things musingly, and by small degrees, seemed, indeed, to be a\r\nduty in the Egdon valleys at this transitional hour, for there was that\r\nin the condition of the heath itself which resembled protracted and\r\nhalting dubiousness. It was the quality of the repose appertaining to\r\nthe scene. This was not the repose of actual stagnation, but the\r\napparent repose of incredible slowness. A condition of healthy life so\r\nnearly resembling the torpor of death is a noticeable thing of its\r\nsort; to exhibit the inertness of the desert, and at the same time to\r\nbe exercising powers akin to those of the meadow, and even of the\r\nforest, awakened in those who thought of it the attentiveness usually\r\nengendered by understatement and reserve.\r\n\r\nThe scene before the reddleman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes was a gradual series of ascents\r\nfrom the level of the road backward into the heart of the heath. It\r\nembraced hillocks, pits, ridges, acclivities, one behind the other,\r\ntill all was finished by a high hill cutting against the still light\r\nsky. The traveller\xe2\x80\x99s eye hovered about these things for a time, and\r\nfinally settled upon one noteworthy object up there. It was a barrow.\r\nThis bossy projection of earth above its natural level occupied the\r\nloftiest ground of the loneliest height that the heath contained.\r\nAlthough from the vale it appeared but as a wart on an Atlantean brow,\r\nits actual bulk was great. It formed the pole and axis of this heathery\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAs the resting man looked at the barrow he became aware that its\r\nsummit, hitherto the highest object in the whole prospect round, was\r\nsurmounted by something higher. It rose from the semiglobular mound\r\nlike a spike from a helmet. The first instinct of an imaginative\r\nstranger might have been to suppose it the person of one of the Celts\r\nwho built the barrow, so far had all of modern date withdrawn from the\r\nscene. It seemed a sort of last man among them, musing for a moment\r\nbefore dropping into eternal night with the rest of his race.\r\n\r\nThere the form stood, motionless as the hill beneath. Above the plain\r\nrose the hill, above the hill rose the barrow, and above the barrow\r\nrose the figure. Above the figure was nothing that could be mapped\r\nelsewhere than on a celestial globe.\r\n\r\nSuch a perfect, delicate, and necessary finish did the figure give to\r\nthe dark pile of hills that it seemed to be the only obvious\r\njustification of their outline. Without it, there was the dome without\r\nthe lantern; with it the architectural demands of the mass were\r\nsatisfied. The scene was strangely homogeneous, in that the vale, the\r\nupland, the barrow, and the figure above it amounted only to unity.\r\nLooking at this or that member of the group was not observing a\r\ncomplete thing, but a fraction of a thing.\r\n\r\nThe form was so much like an organic part of the entire motionless\r\nstructure that to see it move would have impressed the mind as a\r\nstrange phenomenon. Immobility being the chief characteristic of that\r\nwhole which the person formed portion of, the discontinuance of\r\nimmobility in any quarter suggested confusion.\r\n\r\nYet that is what happened. The figure perceptibly gave up its fixity,\r\nshifted a step or two, and turned round. As if alarmed, it descended on\r\nthe right side of the barrow, with the glide of a water-drop down a\r\nbud, and then vanished. The movement had been sufficient to show more\r\nclearly the characteristics of the figure, and that it was a woman\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nThe reason of her sudden displacement now appeared. With her dropping\r\nout of sight on the right side, a newcomer, bearing a burden, protruded\r\ninto the sky on the left side, ascended the tumulus, and deposited the\r\nburden on the top. A second followed, then a third, a fourth, a fifth,\r\nand ultimately the whole barrow was peopled with burdened figures.\r\n\r\nThe only intelligible meaning in this sky-backed pantomime of\r\nsilhouettes was that the woman had no relation to the forms who had\r\ntaken her place, was sedulously avoiding these, and had come thither\r\nfor another object than theirs. The imagination of the observer clung\r\nby preference to that vanished, solitary figure, as to something more\r\ninteresting, more important, more likely to have a history worth\r\nknowing than these newcomers, and unconsciously regarded them as\r\nintruders. But they remained, and established themselves; and the\r\nlonely person who hitherto had been queen of the solitude did not at\r\npresent seem likely to return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nThe Custom of the Country\r\n\r\n\r\nHad a looker-on been posted in the immediate vicinity of the barrow, he\r\nwould have learned that these persons were boys and men of the\r\nneighbouring hamlets. Each, as he ascended the barrow, had been heavily\r\nladen with furze faggots, carried upon the shoulder by means of a long\r\nstake sharpened at each end for impaling them easily\xe2\x80\x94two in front and\r\ntwo behind. They came from a part of the heath a quarter of a mile to\r\nthe rear, where furze almost exclusively prevailed as a product.\r\n\r\nEvery individual was so involved in furze by his method of carrying the\r\nfaggots that he appeared like a bush on legs till he had thrown them\r\ndown. The party had marched in trail, like a travelling flock of sheep;\r\nthat is to say, the strongest first, the weak and young behind.\r\n\r\nThe loads were all laid together, and a pyramid of furze thirty feet in\r\ncircumference now occupied the crown of the tumulus, which was known as\r\nRainbarrow for many miles round. Some made themselves busy with\r\nmatches, and in selecting the driest tufts of furze, others in\r\nloosening the bramble bonds which held the faggots together. Others,\r\nagain, while this was in progress, lifted their eyes and swept the vast\r\nexpanse of country commanded by their position, now lying nearly\r\nobliterated by shade. In the valleys of the heath nothing save its own\r\nwild face was visible at any time of day; but this spot commanded a\r\nhorizon enclosing a tract of far extent, and in many cases lying beyond\r\nthe heath country. None of its features could be seen now, but the\r\nwhole made itself felt as a vague stretch of remoteness.\r\n\r\nWhile the men and lads were building the pile, a change took place in\r\nthe mass of shade which denoted the distant landscape. Red suns and\r\ntufts of fire one by one began to arise, flecking the whole country\r\nround. They were the bonfires of other parishes and hamlets that were\r\nengaged in the same sort of commemoration. Some were distant, and stood\r\nin a dense atmosphere, so that bundles of pale straw-like beams\r\nradiated around them in the shape of a fan. Some were large and near,\r\nglowing scarlet-red from the shade, like wounds in a black hide. Some\r\nwere M\xc3\xa6nades, with winy faces and blown hair. These tinctured the\r\nsilent bosom of the clouds above them and lit up their ephemeral caves,\r\nwhich seemed thenceforth to become scalding caldrons. Perhaps as many\r\nas thirty bonfires could be counted within the whole bounds of the\r\ndistrict; and as the hour may be told on a clock-face when the figures\r\nthemselves are invisible, so did the men recognize the locality of each\r\nfire by its angle and direction, though nothing of the scenery could be\r\nviewed.\r\n\r\nThe first tall flame from Rainbarrow sprang into the sky, attracting\r\nall eyes that had been fixed on the distant conflagrations back to\r\ntheir own attempt in the same kind. The cheerful blaze streaked the\r\ninner surface of the human circle\xe2\x80\x94now increased by other stragglers,\r\nmale and female\xe2\x80\x94with its own gold livery, and even overlaid the dark\r\nturf around with a lively luminousness, which softened off into\r\nobscurity where the barrow rounded downwards out of sight. It showed\r\nthe barrow to be the segment of a globe, as perfect as on the day when\r\nit was thrown up, even the little ditch remaining from which the earth\r\nwas dug. Not a plough had ever disturbed a grain of that stubborn soil.\r\nIn the heath\xe2\x80\x99s barrenness to the farmer lay its fertility to the\r\nhistorian. There had been no obliteration, because there had been no\r\ntending.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if the bonfire-makers were standing in some radiant upper\r\nstory of the world, detached from and independent of the dark stretches\r\nbelow. The heath down there was now a vast abyss, and no longer a\r\ncontinuation of what they stood on; for their eyes, adapted to the\r\nblaze, could see nothing of the deeps beyond its influence.\r\nOccasionally, it is true, a more vigorous flare than usual from their\r\nfaggots sent darting lights like aides-de-camp down the inclines to\r\nsome distant bush, pool, or patch of white sand, kindling these to\r\nreplies of the same colour, till all was lost in darkness again. Then\r\nthe whole black phenomenon beneath represented Limbo as viewed from the\r\nbrink by the sublime Florentine in his vision, and the muttered\r\narticulations of the wind in the hollows were as complaints and\r\npetitions from the \xe2\x80\x9csouls of mighty worth\xe2\x80\x9d suspended therein.\r\n\r\nIt was as if these men and boys had suddenly dived into past ages, and\r\nfetched therefrom an hour and deed which had before been familiar with\r\nthis spot. The ashes of the original British pyre which blazed from\r\nthat summit lay fresh and undisturbed in the barrow beneath their\r\ntread. The flames from funeral piles long ago kindled there had shone\r\ndown upon the lowlands as these were shining now. Festival fires to\r\nThor and Woden had followed on the same ground and duly had their day.\r\nIndeed, it is pretty well known that such blazes as this the heathmen\r\nwere now enjoying are rather the lineal descendants from jumbled\r\nDruidical rites and Saxon ceremonies than the invention of popular\r\nfeeling about Gunpowder Plot.\r\n\r\nMoreover to light a fire is the instinctive and resistant act of man\r\nwhen, at the winter ingress, the curfew is sounded throughout Nature.\r\nIt indicates a spontaneous, Promethean rebelliousness against that fiat\r\nthat this recurrent season shall bring foul times, cold darkness,\r\nmisery and death. Black chaos comes, and the fettered gods of the earth\r\nsay, Let there be light.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant lights and sooty shades which struggled upon the skin and\r\nclothes of the persons standing round caused their lineaments and\r\ngeneral contours to be drawn with Dureresque vigour and dash. Yet the\r\npermanent moral expression of each face it was impossible to discover,\r\nfor as the nimble flames towered, nodded, and swooped through the\r\nsurrounding air, the blots of shade and flakes of light upon the\r\ncountenances of the group changed shape and position endlessly. All was\r\nunstable; quivering as leaves, evanescent as lightning. Shadowy\r\neye-sockets, deep as those of a death\xe2\x80\x99s head, suddenly turned into pits\r\nof lustre: a lantern-jaw was cavernous, then it was shining; wrinkles\r\nwere emphasized to ravines, or obliterated entirely by a changed ray.\r\nNostrils were dark wells; sinews in old necks were gilt mouldings;\r\nthings with no particular polish on them were glazed; bright objects,\r\nsuch as the tip of a furze-hook one of the men carried, were as glass;\r\neyeballs glowed like little lanterns. Those whom Nature had depicted as\r\nmerely quaint became grotesque, the grotesque became preternatural; for\r\nall was in extremity.\r\n\r\nHence it may be that the face of an old man, who had like others been\r\ncalled to the heights by the rising flames, was not really the mere\r\nnose and chin that it appeared to be, but an appreciable quantity of\r\nhuman countenance. He stood complacently sunning himself in the heat.\r\nWith a speaker, or stake, he tossed the outlying scraps of fuel into\r\nthe conflagration, looking at the midst of the pile, occasionally\r\nlifting his eyes to measure the height of the flame, or to follow the\r\ngreat sparks which rose with it and sailed away into darkness. The\r\nbeaming sight, and the penetrating warmth, seemed to breed in him a\r\ncumulative cheerfulness, which soon amounted to delight. With his stick\r\nin his hand he began to jig a private minuet, a bunch of copper seals\r\nshining and swinging like a pendulum from under his waistcoat: he also\r\nbegan to sing, in the voice of a bee up a flue\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe king\xe2\x80\xb2 call\xe2\x80\x99d down\xe2\x80\xb2 his no-bles all\xe2\x80\xb2,\r\nBy one\xe2\x80\xb2, by two\xe2\x80\xb2, by three\xe2\x80\xb2;\r\nEarl Mar\xe2\x80\xb2-shal, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\xb2 go shrive\xe2\x80\xb2-the queen\xe2\x80\xb2,\r\nAnd thou\xe2\x80\xb2 shalt wend\xe2\x80\xb2 with me\xe2\x80\xb2.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA boon\xe2\x80\xb2, a boon\xe2\x80\xb2, quoth Earl\xe2\x80\xb2 Mar-shal\xe2\x80\xb2,\r\nAnd fell\xe2\x80\xb2 on his bend\xe2\x80\xb2-ded knee\xe2\x80\xb2,\r\nThat what\xe2\x80\xb2-so-e\xe2\x80\x99er\xe2\x80\xb2 the queen\xe2\x80\xb2 shall say\xe2\x80\xb2,\r\nNo harm\xe2\x80\xb2 there-of\xe2\x80\xb2 may be\xe2\x80\xb2.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nWant of breath prevented a continuance of the song; and the breakdown\r\nattracted the attention of a firm-standing man of middle age, who kept\r\neach corner of his crescent-shaped mouth rigorously drawn back into his\r\ncheek, as if to do away with any suspicion of mirthfulness which might\r\nerroneously have attached to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fair stave, Grandfer Cantle; but I am afeard \xe2\x80\x99tis too much for the\r\nmouldy weasand of such a old man as you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the wrinkled\r\nreveller. \xe2\x80\x9cDostn\xe2\x80\x99t wish th\xe2\x80\x99 wast three sixes again, Grandfer, as you\r\nwas when you first learnt to sing it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey?\xe2\x80\x9d said Grandfer Cantle, stopping in his dance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDostn\xe2\x80\x99t wish wast young again, I say? There\xe2\x80\x99s a hole in thy poor\r\nbellows nowadays seemingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s good art in me? If I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make a little wind go a long\r\nways I should seem no younger than the most aged man, should I,\r\nTimothy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how about the new-married folks down there at the Quiet Woman\r\nInn?\xe2\x80\x9d the other inquired, pointing towards a dim light in the direction\r\nof the distant highway, but considerably apart from where the reddleman\r\nwas at that moment resting. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the rights of the matter about \xe2\x80\x99em?\r\nYou ought to know, being an understanding man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut a little rakish, hey? I own to it. Master Cantle is that, or he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing. Yet \xe2\x80\x99tis a gay fault, neighbour Fairway, that age will cure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard that they were coming home tonight. By this time they must\r\nhave come. What besides?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next thing is for us to go and wish \xe2\x80\x99em joy, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo? Now, I thought we must. I must, or \xe2\x80\x99twould be very unlike me\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nfirst in every spree that\xe2\x80\x99s going!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo thou\xe2\x80\xb2 put on\xe2\x80\xb2 a fri\xe2\x80\xb2-ar\xe2\x80\x99s coat\xe2\x80\xb2,\r\nAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\xb2 put on\xe2\x80\xb2 a-no\xe2\x80\xb2-ther,\r\nAnd we\xe2\x80\xb2 will to\xe2\x80\xb2 Queen Ele\xe2\x80\xb2anor go\xe2\x80\xb2,\r\nLike Fri\xe2\x80\xb2ar and\xe2\x80\xb2 his bro\xe2\x80\xb2ther.\r\n\r\n\r\nI met Mis\xe2\x80\x99ess Yeobright, the young bride\xe2\x80\x99s aunt, last night, and she\r\ntold me that her son Clym was coming home a\xe2\x80\x99 Christmas. Wonderful\r\nclever, \xe2\x80\x99a believe\xe2\x80\x94ah, I should like to have all that\xe2\x80\x99s under that\r\nyoung man\xe2\x80\x99s hair. Well, then, I spoke to her in my well-known merry\r\nway, and she said, \xe2\x80\x98O that what\xe2\x80\x99s shaped so venerable should talk like\r\na fool!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what she said to me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for her, be jowned if\r\nI do, and so I told her. \xe2\x80\x98Be jowned if I care for \xe2\x80\x99ee,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. I had\r\nher there\xe2\x80\x94hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rather think she had you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grandfer Cantle, his countenance slightly flagging. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nso bad as that with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeemingly \xe2\x80\x99tis, however, is it because of the wedding that Clym is\r\ncoming home a\xe2\x80\x99 Christmas\xe2\x80\x94to make a new arrangement because his mother\r\nis now left in the house alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s it. But, Timothy, hearken to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grandfer\r\nearnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cThough known as such a joker, I be an understanding man if\r\nyou catch me serious, and I am serious now. I can tell \xe2\x80\x99ee lots about\r\nthe married couple. Yes, this morning at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock they went up the\r\ncountry to do the job, and neither vell nor mark have been seen of \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nsince, though I reckon that this afternoon has brought \xe2\x80\x99em home again\r\nman and woman\xe2\x80\x94wife, that is. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it spoke like a man, Timothy, and\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t Mis\xe2\x80\x99ess Yeobright wrong about me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it will do. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the two had walked together since last\r\nfall, when her aunt forbad the banns. How long has this new set-to been\r\nin mangling then? Do you know, Humphrey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, how long?\xe2\x80\x9d said Grandfer Cantle smartly, likewise turning to\r\nHumphrey. \xe2\x80\x9cI ask that question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEver since her aunt altered her mind, and said she might have the man\r\nafter all,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Humphrey, without removing his eyes from the fire.\r\nHe was a somewhat solemn young fellow, and carried the hook and leather\r\ngloves of a furze-cutter, his legs, by reason of that occupation, being\r\nsheathed in bulging leggings as stiff as the Philistine\xe2\x80\x99s greaves of\r\nbrass. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why they went away to be married, I count. You see,\r\nafter kicking up such a nunny-watch and forbidding the banns \xe2\x80\x99twould\r\nhave made Mis\xe2\x80\x99ess Yeobright seem foolish-like to have a banging wedding\r\nin the same parish all as if she\xe2\x80\x99d never gainsaid it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly\xe2\x80\x94seem foolish-like; and that\xe2\x80\x99s very bad for the poor things\r\nthat be so, though I only guess as much, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grandfer\r\nCantle, still strenuously preserving a sensible bearing and mien.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, I was at church that day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich was a very\r\ncurious thing to happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf \xe2\x80\x99twasn\xe2\x80\x99t my name\xe2\x80\x99s Simple,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grandfer emphatically. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t been there to-year; and now the winter is a-coming on I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay I shall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t been these three years,\xe2\x80\x9d said Humphrey; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I\xe2\x80\x99m so dead\r\nsleepy of a Sunday; and \xe2\x80\x99tis so terrible far to get there; and when you\r\ndo get there \xe2\x80\x99tis such a mortal poor chance that you\xe2\x80\x99ll be chose for up\r\nabove, when so many bain\xe2\x80\x99t, that I bide at home and don\xe2\x80\x99t go at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI not only happened to be there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway, with a fresh\r\ncollection of emphasis, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I was sitting in the same pew as Mis\xe2\x80\x99ess\r\nYeobright. And though you may not see it as such, it fairly made my\r\nblood run cold to hear her. Yes, it is a curious thing; but it made my\r\nblood run cold, for I was close at her elbow.\xe2\x80\x9d The speaker looked round\r\nupon the bystanders, now drawing closer to hear him, with his lips\r\ngathered tighter than ever in the rigorousness of his descriptive\r\nmoderation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a serious job to have things happen to \xe2\x80\x99ee there,\xe2\x80\x9d said a woman\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Ye are to declare it,\xe2\x80\x99 was the parson\xe2\x80\x99s words,\xe2\x80\x9d Fairway continued.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then up stood a woman at my side\xe2\x80\x94a-touching of me. \xe2\x80\x98Well, be\r\ndamned if there isn\xe2\x80\x99t Mis\xe2\x80\x99ess Yeobright a-standing up,\xe2\x80\x99 I said to\r\nmyself. Yes, neighbours, though I was in the temple of prayer that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat I said. \xe2\x80\x99Tis against my conscience to curse and swear in company,\r\nand I hope any woman here will overlook it. Still what I did say I did\r\nsay, and \xe2\x80\x99twould be a lie if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t own it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo \xe2\x80\x99twould, neighbour Fairway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Be damned if there isn\xe2\x80\x99t Mis\xe2\x80\x99ess Yeobright a-standing up,\xe2\x80\x99 I said,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe narrator repeated, giving out the bad word with the same\r\npassionless severity of face as before, which proved how entirely\r\nnecessity and not gusto had to do with the iteration. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the next\r\nthing I heard was, \xe2\x80\x98I forbid the banns,\xe2\x80\x99 from her. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll speak to you\r\nafter the service,\xe2\x80\x99 said the parson, in quite a homely way\xe2\x80\x94yes, turning\r\nall at once into a common man no holier than you or I. Ah, her face was\r\npale! Maybe you can call to mind that monument in Weatherbury\r\nchurch\xe2\x80\x94the cross-legged soldier that have had his arm knocked away by\r\nthe schoolchildren? Well, he would about have matched that woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface, when she said, \xe2\x80\x98I forbid the banns.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe audience cleared their throats and tossed a few stalks into the\r\nfire, not because these deeds were urgent, but to give themselves time\r\nto weigh the moral of the story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure when I heard they\xe2\x80\x99d been forbid I felt as glad as if anybody\r\nhad gied me sixpence,\xe2\x80\x9d said an earnest voice\xe2\x80\x94that of Olly Dowden, a\r\nwoman who lived by making heath brooms, or besoms. Her nature was to be\r\ncivil to enemies as well as to friends, and grateful to all the world\r\nfor letting her remain alive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now the maid have married him just the same,\xe2\x80\x9d said Humphrey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter that Mis\xe2\x80\x99ess Yeobright came round and was quite agreeable,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nFairway resumed, with an unheeding air, to show that his words were no\r\nappendage to Humphrey\xe2\x80\x99s, but the result of independent reflection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSupposing they were ashamed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done\r\nit here-right,\xe2\x80\x9d said a wide-spread woman whose stays creaked like shoes\r\nwhenever she stooped or turned. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis well to call the neighbours\r\ntogether and to hae a good racket once now and then; and it may as well\r\nbe when there\xe2\x80\x99s a wedding as at tide-times. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for close\r\nways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, now, you\xe2\x80\x99d hardly believe it, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for gay weddings,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Timothy Fairway, his eyes again travelling round. \xe2\x80\x9cI hardly blame\r\nThomasin Yeobright and neighbour Wildeve for doing it quiet, if I must\r\nown it. A wedding at home means five and six-handed reels by the hour;\r\nand they do a man\xe2\x80\x99s legs no good when he\xe2\x80\x99s over forty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue. Once at the woman\xe2\x80\x99s house you can hardly say nay to being one in\r\na jig, knowing all the time that you be expected to make yourself worth\r\nyour victuals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou be bound to dance at Christmas because \xe2\x80\x99tis the time o\xe2\x80\x99 year; you\r\nmust dance at weddings because \xe2\x80\x99tis the time o\xe2\x80\x99 life. At christenings\r\nfolk will even smuggle in a reel or two, if \xe2\x80\x99tis no further on than the\r\nfirst or second chiel. And this is not naming the songs you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\r\nsing.... For my part I like a good hearty funeral as well as anything.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve as splendid victuals and drink as at other parties, and even\r\nbetter. And it don\xe2\x80\x99t wear your legs to stumps in talking over a poor\r\nfellow\xe2\x80\x99s ways as it do to stand up in hornpipes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNine folks out of ten would own \xe2\x80\x99twas going too far to dance then, I\r\nsuppose?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Grandfer Cantle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis the only sort of party a staid man can feel safe at after the mug\r\nhave been round a few times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand a quiet ladylike little body like Tamsin\r\nYeobright caring to be married in such a mean way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan Nunsuch,\r\nthe wide woman, who preferred the original subject. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis worse than\r\nthe poorest do. And I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have cared about the man, though some\r\nmay say he\xe2\x80\x99s good-looking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo give him his due he\xe2\x80\x99s a clever, learned fellow in his way\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x99most as\r\nclever as Clym Yeobright used to be. He was brought up to better things\r\nthan keeping the Quiet Woman. An engineer\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what the man was, as\r\nwe know; but he threw away his chance, and so \xe2\x80\x99a took a public house to\r\nlive. His learning was no use to him at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery often the case,\xe2\x80\x9d said Olly, the besom-maker. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet how people\r\ndo strive after it and get it! The class of folk that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t use to\r\nmake a round O to save their bones from the pit can write their names\r\nnow without a sputter of the pen, oftentimes without a single blot\xe2\x80\x94what\r\ndo I say?\xe2\x80\x94why, almost without a desk to lean their stomachs and elbows\r\nupon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis amazing what a polish the world have been brought to,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHumphrey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, afore I went a soldier in the Bang-up Locals (as we was called),\r\nin the year four,\xe2\x80\x9d chimed in Grandfer Cantle brightly, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nno more what the world was like than the commonest man among ye. And\r\nnow, jown it all, I won\xe2\x80\x99t say what I bain\xe2\x80\x99t fit for, hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldst sign the book, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway, \xe2\x80\x9cif wast young enough\r\nto join hands with a woman again, like Wildeve and Mis\xe2\x80\x99ess Tamsin,\r\nwhich is more than Humph there could do, for he follows his father in\r\nlearning. Ah, Humph, well I can mind when I was married how I zid thy\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s mark staring me in the face as I went to put down my name. He\r\nand your mother were the couple married just afore we were and there\r\nstood they father\xe2\x80\x99s cross with arms stretched out like a great banging\r\nscarecrow. What a terrible black cross that was\xe2\x80\x94thy father\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\nlikeness in en! To save my soul I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help laughing when I zid en,\r\nthough all the time I was as hot as dog-days, what with the marrying,\r\nand what with the woman a-hanging to me, and what with Jack Changley\r\nand a lot more chaps grinning at me through church window. But the next\r\nmoment a strawmote would have knocked me down, for I called to mind\r\nthat if thy father and mother had had high words once, they\xe2\x80\x99d been at\r\nit twenty times since they\xe2\x80\x99d been man and wife, and I zid myself as the\r\nnext poor stunpoll to get into the same mess.... Ah\xe2\x80\x94well, what a day\r\n\xe2\x80\x99twas!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWildeve is older than Tamsin Yeobright by a good-few summers. A pretty\r\nmaid too she is. A young woman with a home must be a fool to tear her\r\nsmock for a man like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe speaker, a peat- or turf-cutter, who had newly joined the group,\r\ncarried across his shoulder the singular heart-shaped spade of large\r\ndimensions used in that species of labour, and its well-whetted edge\r\ngleamed like a silver bow in the beams of the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA hundred maidens would have had him if he\xe2\x80\x99d asked \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said the wide\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidst ever know a man, neighbour, that no woman at all would marry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninquired Humphrey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never did,\xe2\x80\x9d said the turf-cutter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor I,\xe2\x80\x9d said another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grandfer Cantle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, I did once,\xe2\x80\x9d said Timothy Fairway, adding more firmness to\r\none of his legs. \xe2\x80\x9cI did know of such a man. But only once, mind.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\ngave his throat a thorough rake round, as if it were the duty of every\r\nperson not to be mistaken through thickness of voice. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I knew of\r\nsuch a man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what ghastly gallicrow might the poor fellow have been like,\r\nMaster Fairway?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the turf-cutter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, \xe2\x80\x99a was neither a deaf man, nor a dumb man, nor a blind man. What\r\n\xe2\x80\x99a was I don\xe2\x80\x99t say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he known in these parts?\xe2\x80\x9d said Olly Dowden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHardly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Timothy; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I name no name.... Come, keep the fire up\r\nthere, youngsters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever is Christian Cantle\xe2\x80\x99s teeth a-chattering for?\xe2\x80\x9d said a boy\r\nfrom amid the smoke and shades on the other side of the blaze. \xe2\x80\x9cBe ye\r\na-cold, Christian?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA thin jibbering voice was heard to reply, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, not at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome forward, Christian, and show yourself. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you were\r\nhere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway, with a humane look across towards that quarter.\r\n\r\nThus requested, a faltering man, with reedy hair, no shoulders, and a\r\ngreat quantity of wrist and ankle beyond his clothes, advanced a step\r\nor two by his own will, and was pushed by the will of others half a\r\ndozen steps more. He was Grandfer Cantle\xe2\x80\x99s youngest son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat be ye quaking for, Christian?\xe2\x80\x9d said the turf-cutter kindly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man no woman will marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deuce you be!\xe2\x80\x9d said Timothy Fairway, enlarging his gaze to cover\r\nChristian\xe2\x80\x99s whole surface and a great deal more, Grandfer Cantle\r\nmeanwhile staring as a hen stares at the duck she has hatched.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I be he; and it makes me afeard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christian. \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99ye think\r\n\xe2\x80\x99twill hurt me? I shall always say I don\xe2\x80\x99t care, and swear to it,\r\nthough I do care all the while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, be damned if this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the queerest start ever I know\xe2\x80\x99d,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr. Fairway. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you at all. There\xe2\x80\x99s another in the country,\r\nthen! Why did ye reveal yer misfortune, Christian?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas to be if \xe2\x80\x99twas, I suppose. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it, can I?\xe2\x80\x9d He turned\r\nupon them his painfully circular eyes, surrounded by concentric lines\r\nlike targets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that\xe2\x80\x99s true. But \xe2\x80\x99tis a melancholy thing, and my blood ran cold\r\nwhen you spoke, for I felt there were two poor fellows where I had\r\nthought only one. \xe2\x80\x99Tis a sad thing for ye, Christian. How\xe2\x80\x99st know the\r\nwomen won\xe2\x80\x99t hae thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve asked \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure I should never have thought you had the face. Well, and what did\r\nthe last one say to ye? Nothing that can\xe2\x80\x99t be got over, perhaps, after\r\nall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Get out of my sight, you slack-twisted, slim-looking maphrotight\r\nfool,\xe2\x80\x99 was the woman\xe2\x80\x99s words to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot encouraging, I own,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Get out of my sight, you\r\nslack-twisted, slim-looking maphrotight fool,\xe2\x80\x99 is rather a hard way of\r\nsaying No. But even that might be overcome by time and patience, so as\r\nto let a few grey hairs show themselves in the hussy\xe2\x80\x99s head. How old be\r\nyou, Christian?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirty-one last tatie-digging, Mister Fairway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a boy\xe2\x80\x94not a boy. Still there\xe2\x80\x99s hope yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my age by baptism, because that\xe2\x80\x99s put down in the great book of\r\nthe Judgment that they keep in church vestry; but Mother told me I was\r\nborn some time afore I was christened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell when, to save her life, except that there was no\r\nmoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo moon\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s bad. Hey, neighbours, that\xe2\x80\x99s bad for him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, \xe2\x80\x99tis bad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grandfer Cantle, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother know\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99twas no moon, for she asked another woman that had an\r\nalmanac, as she did whenever a boy was born to her, because of the\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x98No moon, no man,\xe2\x80\x99 which made her afeard every man-child she\r\nhad. Do ye really think it serious, Mister Fairway, that there was no\r\nmoon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. \xe2\x80\x98No moon, no man.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99Tis one of the truest sayings ever spit out.\r\nThe boy never comes to anything that\xe2\x80\x99s born at new moon. A bad job for\r\nthee, Christian, that you should have showed your nose then of all days\r\nin the month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose the moon was terrible full when you were born?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nChristian, with a look of hopeless admiration at Fairway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, \xe2\x80\x99a was not new,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Fairway replied, with a disinterested gaze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d sooner go without drink at Lammas-tide than be a man of no moon,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued Christian, in the same shattered recitative. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis said I be\r\nonly the rames of a man, and no good for my race at all; and I suppose\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the cause o\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grandfer Cantle, somewhat subdued in spirit; \xe2\x80\x9cand yet his\r\nmother cried for scores of hours when \xe2\x80\x99a was a boy, for fear he should\r\noutgrow hisself and go for a soldier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there\xe2\x80\x99s many just as bad as he.\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWethers must live their time as well as other sheep, poor soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo perhaps I shall rub on? Ought I to be afeared o\xe2\x80\x99 nights, Master\r\nFairway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to lie alone all your life; and \xe2\x80\x99tis not to married\r\ncouples but to single sleepers that a ghost shows himself when \xe2\x80\x99a do\r\ncome. One has been seen lately, too. A very strange one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it if \xe2\x80\x99tis agreeable of ye not to! \xe2\x80\x99Twill make my\r\nskin crawl when I think of it in bed alone. But you will\xe2\x80\x94ah, you will,\r\nI know, Timothy; and I shall dream all night o\xe2\x80\x99t! A very strange one?\r\nWhat sort of a spirit did ye mean when ye said, a very strange one,\r\nTimothy?\xe2\x80\x94no, no\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t half believe in spirits myself. But I think it ghostly\r\nenough\xe2\x80\x94what I was told. \xe2\x80\x99Twas a little boy that zid it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it like?\xe2\x80\x94no, don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA red one. Yes, most ghosts be white; but this is as if it had been\r\ndipped in blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristian drew a deep breath without letting it expand his body, and\r\nHumphrey said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere has it been seen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot exactly here; but in this same heth. But \xe2\x80\x99tisn\xe2\x80\x99t a thing to talk\r\nabout. What do ye say,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Fairway in brisker tones, and turning\r\nupon them as if the idea had not been Grandfer Cantle\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you\r\nsay to giving the new man and wife a bit of a song tonight afore we go\r\nto bed\xe2\x80\x94being their wedding-day? When folks are just married \xe2\x80\x99tis as\r\nwell to look glad o\xe2\x80\x99t, since looking sorry won\xe2\x80\x99t unjoin \xe2\x80\x99em. I am no\r\ndrinker, as we know, but when the womenfolk and youngsters have gone\r\nhome we can drop down across to the Quiet Woman, and strike up a ballet\r\nin front of the married folks\xe2\x80\x99 door. \xe2\x80\x99Twill please the young wife, and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what I should like to do, for many\xe2\x80\x99s the skinful I\xe2\x80\x99ve had at her\r\nhands when she lived with her aunt at Blooms-End.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey? And so we will!\xe2\x80\x9d said Grandfer Cantle, turning so briskly that\r\nhis copper seals swung extravagantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m as dry as a kex with biding\r\nup here in the wind, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the colour of drink since\r\nnammet-time today. \xe2\x80\x99Tis said that the last brew at the Woman is very\r\npretty drinking. And, neighbours, if we should be a little late in the\r\nfinishing, why, tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s Sunday, and we can sleep it off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrandfer Cantle! you take things very careless for an old man,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe wide woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take things careless; I do\xe2\x80\x94too careless to please the women! Klk!\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll sing the \xe2\x80\x98Jovial Crew,\xe2\x80\x99 or any other song, when a weak old man\r\nwould cry his eyes out. Jown it; I am up for anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe king\xe2\x80\xb2 look\xe2\x80\x99d o\xe2\x80\xb2-ver his left\xe2\x80\xb2 shoul-der\xe2\x80\xb2,\r\nAnd a grim\xe2\x80\xb2 look look\xe2\x80\xb2-ed hee\xe2\x80\xb2,\r\nEarl Mar\xe2\x80\xb2-shal, he said\xe2\x80\xb2, but for\xe2\x80\xb2 my oath\xe2\x80\xb2\r\nOr hang\xe2\x80\xb2-ed thou\xe2\x80\xb2 shouldst bee\xe2\x80\xb2.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ll do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll give \xe2\x80\x99em a song, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nit please the Lord. What\xe2\x80\x99s the good of Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s cousin Clym a-coming\r\nhome after the deed\xe2\x80\x99s done? He should have come afore, if so be he\r\nwanted to stop it, and marry her himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he\xe2\x80\x99s coming to bide with his mother a little time, as she must\r\nfeel lonely now the maid\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, \xe2\x80\x99tis very odd, but I never feel lonely\xe2\x80\x94no, not at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGrandfer Cantle. \xe2\x80\x9cI am as brave in the nighttime as a\xe2\x80\x99 admiral!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bonfire was by this time beginning to sink low, for the fuel had\r\nnot been of that substantial sort which can support a blaze long. Most\r\nof the other fires within the wide horizon were also dwindling weak.\r\nAttentive observation of their brightness, colour, and length of\r\nexistence would have revealed the quality of the material burnt, and\r\nthrough that, to some extent the natural produce of the district in\r\nwhich each bonfire was situate. The clear, kingly effulgence that had\r\ncharacterized the majority expressed a heath and furze country like\r\ntheir own, which in one direction extended an unlimited number of\r\nmiles; the rapid flares and extinctions at other points of the compass\r\nshowed the lightest of fuel\xe2\x80\x94straw, beanstalks, and the usual waste from\r\narable land. The most enduring of all\xe2\x80\x94steady unaltering eyes like\r\nPlanets\xe2\x80\x94signified wood, such as hazel-branches, thorn-faggots, and\r\nstout billets. Fires of the last-mentioned materials were rare, and\r\nthough comparatively small in magnitude beside the transient blazes,\r\nnow began to get the best of them by mere long continuance. The great\r\nones had perished, but these remained. They occupied the remotest\r\nvisible positions\xe2\x80\x94sky-backed summits rising out of rich coppice and\r\nplantation districts to the north, where the soil was different, and\r\nheath foreign and strange.\r\n\r\nSave one; and this was the nearest of any, the moon of the whole\r\nshining throng. It lay in a direction precisely opposite to that of the\r\nlittle window in the vale below. Its nearness was such that,\r\nnotwithstanding its actual smallness, its glow infinitely transcended\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\nThis quiet eye had attracted attention from time to time; and when\r\ntheir own fire had become sunken and dim it attracted more; some even\r\nof the wood fires more recently lighted had reached their decline, but\r\nno change was perceptible here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, how near that fire is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway. \xe2\x80\x9cSeemingly. I can\r\nsee a fellow of some sort walking round it. Little and good must be\r\nsaid of that fire, surely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can throw a stone there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so can I!\xe2\x80\x9d said Grandfer Cantle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, you can\xe2\x80\x99t, my sonnies. That fire is not much less than a mile\r\noff, for all that \xe2\x80\x99a seems so near.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis in the heath, but no furze,\xe2\x80\x9d said the turf-cutter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis cleft-wood, that\xe2\x80\x99s what \xe2\x80\x99tis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Timothy Fairway. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing\r\nwould burn like that except clean timber. And \xe2\x80\x99tis on the knap afore\r\nthe old captain\xe2\x80\x99s house at Mistover. Such a queer mortal as that man\r\nis! To have a little fire inside your own bank and ditch, that nobody\r\nelse may enjoy it or come anigh it! And what a zany an old chap must\r\nbe, to light a bonfire when there\xe2\x80\x99s no youngsters to please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCap\xe2\x80\x99n Vye has been for a long walk today, and is quite tired out,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Grandfer Cantle, \xe2\x80\x9cso \xe2\x80\x99tisn\xe2\x80\x99t likely to be he.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he would hardly afford good fuel like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the wide woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it must be his granddaughter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway. \xe2\x80\x9cNot that a body of\r\nher age can want a fire much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is very strange in her ways, living up there by herself, and such\r\nthings please her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a well-favoured maid enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Humphrey the furze-cutter,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cespecially when she\xe2\x80\x99s got one of her dandy gowns on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, let her bonfire burn an\xe2\x80\x99t will.\r\nOurs is well-nigh out by the look o\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dark \xe2\x80\x99tis now the fire\xe2\x80\x99s gone down!\xe2\x80\x9d said Christian Cantle,\r\nlooking behind him with his hare eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ye think we\xe2\x80\x99d better get\r\nhome-along, neighbours? The heth isn\xe2\x80\x99t haunted, I know; but we\xe2\x80\x99d better\r\nget home.... Ah, what was that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly the wind,\xe2\x80\x9d said the turf-cutter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think Fifth-of-Novembers ought to be kept up by night except\r\nin towns. It should be by day in outstep, ill-accounted places like\r\nthis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, Christian. Lift up your spirits like a man! Susy, dear, you\r\nand I will have a jig\xe2\x80\x94hey, my honey?\xe2\x80\x94before \xe2\x80\x99tis quite too dark to see\r\nhow well-favoured you be still, though so many summers have passed\r\nsince your husband, a son of a witch, snapped you up from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was addressed to Susan Nunsuch; and the next circumstance of which\r\nthe beholders were conscious was a vision of the matron\xe2\x80\x99s broad form\r\nwhisking off towards the space whereon the fire had been kindled. She\r\nwas lifted bodily by Mr. Fairway\xe2\x80\x99s arm, which had been flung round her\r\nwaist before she had become aware of his intention. The site of the\r\nfire was now merely a circle of ashes flecked with red embers and\r\nsparks, the furze having burnt completely away. Once within the circle\r\nhe whirled her round and round in a dance. She was a woman noisily\r\nconstructed; in addition to her enclosing framework of whalebone and\r\nlath, she wore pattens summer and winter, in wet weather and in dry, to\r\npreserve her boots from wear; and when Fairway began to jump about with\r\nher, the clicking of the pattens, the creaking of the stays, and her\r\nscreams of surprise, formed a very audible concert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll crack thy numskull for thee, you mandy chap!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Nunsuch,\r\nas she helplessly danced round with him, her feet playing like\r\ndrumsticks among the sparks. \xe2\x80\x9cMy ankles were all in a fever before,\r\nfrom walking through that prickly furze, and now you must make \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nworse with these vlankers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe vagary of Timothy Fairway was infectious. The turf-cutter seized\r\nold Olly Dowden, and, somewhat more gently, poussetted with her\r\nlikewise. The young men were not slow to imitate the example of their\r\nelders, and seized the maids; Grandfer Cantle and his stick jigged in\r\nthe form of a three-legged object among the rest; and in half a minute\r\nall that could be seen on Rainbarrow was a whirling of dark shapes amid\r\na boiling confusion of sparks, which leapt around the dancers as high\r\nas their waists. The chief noises were women\xe2\x80\x99s shrill cries, men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlaughter, Susan\xe2\x80\x99s stays and pattens, Olly Dowden\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cheu-heu-heu!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthe strumming of the wind upon the furze-bushes, which formed a kind of\r\ntune to the demoniac measure they trod. Christian alone stood aloof,\r\nuneasily rocking himself as he murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cThey ought not to do it\xe2\x80\x94how\r\nthe vlankers do fly! \xe2\x80\x99tis tempting the Wicked one, \xe2\x80\x99tis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that?\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the lads, stopping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94where?\xe2\x80\x9d said Christian, hastily closing up to the rest.\r\n\r\nThe dancers all lessened their speed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas behind you, Christian, that I heard it\xe2\x80\x94down here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis behind me!\xe2\x80\x9d Christian said. \xe2\x80\x9cMatthew, Mark, Luke, and John,\r\nbless the bed that I lie on; four angels guard\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue. What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoi-i-i-i!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a voice from the darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloo-o-o-o!\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there any cart track up across here to Mis\xe2\x80\x99ess Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s, of\r\nBlooms-End?\xe2\x80\x9d came to them in the same voice, as a long, slim indistinct\r\nfigure approached the barrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOught we not to run home as hard as we can, neighbours, as \xe2\x80\x99tis\r\ngetting late?\xe2\x80\x9d said Christian. \xe2\x80\x9cNot run away from one another, you\r\nknow; run close together, I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScrape up a few stray locks of furze, and make a blaze, so that we can\r\nsee who the man is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway.\r\n\r\nWhen the flame arose it revealed a young man in tight raiment, and red\r\nfrom top to toe. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there a track across here to Mis\xe2\x80\x99ess Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy\xe2\x80\x94keep along the path down there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean a way two horses and a van can travel over?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes; you can get up the vale below here with time. The track is\r\nrough, but if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a light your horses may pick along wi\xe2\x80\x99 care.\r\nHave ye brought your cart far up, neighbour reddleman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve left it in the bottom, about half a mile back, I stepped on in\r\nfront to make sure of the way, as \xe2\x80\x99tis night-time, and I han\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nhere for so long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well you can get up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a turn it did give me\r\nwhen I saw him!\xe2\x80\x9d he added to the whole group, the reddleman included.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord\xe2\x80\x99s sake, I thought, whatever fiery mommet is this come to trouble\r\nus? No slight to your looks, reddleman, for ye bain\xe2\x80\x99t bad-looking in\r\nthe groundwork, though the finish is queer. My meaning is just to say\r\nhow curious I felt. I half thought it \xe2\x80\x99twas the devil or the red ghost\r\nthe boy told of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt gied me a turn likewise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan Nunsuch, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I had a dream\r\nlast night of a death\xe2\x80\x99s head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ye talk o\xe2\x80\x99t no more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christian. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he had a handkerchief\r\nover his head he\xe2\x80\x99d look for all the world like the Devil in the picture\r\nof the Temptation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, thank you for telling me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young reddleman, smiling\r\nfaintly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd good night t\xe2\x80\x99ye all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe withdrew from their sight down the barrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancy I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that young man\xe2\x80\x99s face before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Humphrey. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nwhere, or how, or what his name is, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reddleman had not been gone more than a few minutes when another\r\nperson approached the partially revived bonfire. It proved to be a\r\nwell-known and respected widow of the neighbourhood, of a standing\r\nwhich can only be expressed by the word genteel. Her face, encompassed\r\nby the blackness of the receding heath, showed whitely, and without\r\nhalf-lights, like a cameo.\r\n\r\nShe was a woman of middle-age, with well-formed features of the type\r\nusually found where perspicacity is the chief quality enthroned within.\r\nAt moments she seemed to be regarding issues from a Nebo denied to\r\nothers around. She had something of an estranged mien; the solitude\r\nexhaled from the heath was concentrated in this face that had risen\r\nfrom it. The air with which she looked at the heathmen betokened a\r\ncertain unconcern at their presence, or at what might be their opinions\r\nof her for walking in that lonely spot at such an hour, thus indirectly\r\nimplying that in some respect or other they were not up to her level.\r\nThe explanation lay in the fact that though her husband had been a\r\nsmall farmer she herself was a curate\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, who had once dreamt\r\nof doing better things.\r\n\r\nPersons with any weight of character carry, like planets, their\r\natmospheres along with them in their orbits; and the matron who entered\r\nnow upon the scene could, and usually did, bring her own tone into a\r\ncompany. Her normal manner among the heathfolk had that reticence which\r\nresults from the consciousness of superior communicative power. But the\r\neffect of coming into society and light after lonely wandering in\r\ndarkness is a sociability in the comer above its usual pitch, expressed\r\nin the features even more than in words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, \xe2\x80\x99tis Mis\xe2\x80\x99ess Yeobright,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway. \xe2\x80\x9cMis\xe2\x80\x99ess Yeobright, not\r\nten minutes ago a man was here asking for you\xe2\x80\x94a reddleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he want?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething to sell, I suppose; what it can be I am at a loss to\r\nunderstand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to hear that your son Mr. Clym is coming home at Christmas,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, the turf-cutter. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a dog he used to be for\r\nbonfires!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I believe he is coming,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must be a fine fellow by this time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a man now,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis very lonesome for \xe2\x80\x99ee in the heth tonight, mis\xe2\x80\x99ess,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nChristian, coming from the seclusion he had hitherto maintained. \xe2\x80\x9cMind\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t get lost. Egdon Heth is a bad place to get lost in, and the\r\nwinds do huffle queerer tonight than ever I heard \xe2\x80\x99em afore. Them that\r\nknow Egdon best have been pixy-led here at times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that you, Christian?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat made you hide away\r\nfrom me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you in this light, mis\xe2\x80\x99ess; and being a man\r\nof the mournfullest make, I was scared a little, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Oftentimes\r\nif you could see how terrible down I get in my mind, \xe2\x80\x99twould make \xe2\x80\x99ee\r\nquite nervous for fear I should die by my hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t take after your father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright, looking\r\ntowards the fire, where Grandfer Cantle, with some want of originality,\r\nwas dancing by himself among the sparks, as the others had done before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Grandfer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Timothy Fairway, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are ashamed of ye. A\r\nreverent old patriarch man as you be\xe2\x80\x94seventy if a day\xe2\x80\x94to go hornpiping\r\nlike that by yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA harrowing old man, Mis\xe2\x80\x99ess Yeobright,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christian despondingly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t live with him a week, so playward as he is, if I could get\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twould be more seemly in ye to stand still and welcome Mis\xe2\x80\x99ess\r\nYeobright, and you the venerablest here, Grandfer Cantle,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nbesom-woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, and so it would,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reveller checking himself\r\nrepentantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve such a bad memory, Mis\xe2\x80\x99ess Yeobright, that I forget\r\nhow I\xe2\x80\x99m looked up to by the rest of \xe2\x80\x99em. My spirits must be wonderful\r\ngood, you\xe2\x80\x99ll say? But not always. \xe2\x80\x99Tis a weight upon a man to be looked\r\nup to as commander, and I often feel it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to stop the talk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I must be\r\nleaving you now. I was passing down the Anglebury Road, towards my\r\nniece\xe2\x80\x99s new home, who is returning tonight with her husband; and seeing\r\nthe bonfire and hearing Olly\xe2\x80\x99s voice among the rest I came up here to\r\nlearn what was going on. I should like her to walk with me, as her way\r\nis mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, sure, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I\xe2\x80\x99m just thinking of moving,\xe2\x80\x9d said Olly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be safe to meet the reddleman that I told ye of,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nFairway. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s only gone back to get his van. We heard that your niece\r\nand her husband were coming straight home as soon as they were married,\r\nand we are going down there shortly, to give \xe2\x80\x99em a song o\xe2\x80\x99 welcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we shall take a shorter cut through the furze than you can go with\r\nlong clothes; so we won\xe2\x80\x99t trouble you to wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well\xe2\x80\x94are you ready, Olly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. And there\xe2\x80\x99s a light shining from your niece\xe2\x80\x99s window, see.\r\nIt will help to keep us in the path.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe indicated the faint light at the bottom of the valley which Fairway\r\nhad pointed out; and the two women descended the tumulus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nThe Halt on the Turnpike Road\r\n\r\n\r\nDown, downward they went, and yet further down\xe2\x80\x94their descent at each\r\nstep seeming to outmeasure their advance. Their skirts were scratched\r\nnoisily by the furze, their shoulders brushed by the ferns, which,\r\nthough dead and dry, stood erect as when alive, no sufficient winter\r\nweather having as yet arrived to beat them down. Their Tartarean\r\nsituation might by some have been called an imprudent one for two\r\nunattended women. But these shaggy recesses were at all seasons a\r\nfamiliar surrounding to Olly and Mrs. Yeobright; and the addition of\r\ndarkness lends no frightfulness to the face of a friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so Tamsin has married him at last,\xe2\x80\x9d said Olly, when the incline\r\nhad become so much less steep that their foot-steps no longer required\r\nundivided attention.\r\n\r\nMrs. Yeobright answered slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cYes; at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow you will miss her\xe2\x80\x94living with \xe2\x80\x99ee as a daughter, as she always\r\nhave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do miss her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOlly, though without the tact to perceive when remarks were untimely,\r\nwas saved by her very simplicity from rendering them offensive.\r\nQuestions that would have been resented in others she could ask with\r\nimpunity. This accounted for Mrs. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s acquiescence in the\r\nrevival of an evidently sore subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was quite strook to hear you\xe2\x80\x99d agreed to it, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, that I was,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued the besom-maker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were not more struck by it than I should have been last year this\r\ntime, Olly. There are a good many sides to that wedding. I could not\r\ntell you all of them, even if I tried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt myself that he was hardly solid-going enough to mate with your\r\nfamily. Keeping an inn\xe2\x80\x94what is it? But \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99s clever, that\xe2\x80\x99s true, and\r\nthey say he was an engineering gentleman once, but has come down by\r\nbeing too outwardly given.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw that, upon the whole, it would be better she should marry where\r\nshe wished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor little thing, her feelings got the better of her, no doubt. \xe2\x80\x99Tis\r\nnature. Well, they may call him what they will\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99ve several acres of\r\nheth-ground broke up here, besides the public house, and the\r\nheth-croppers, and his manners be quite like a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s. And what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndone cannot be undone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt cannot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright. \xe2\x80\x9cSee, here\xe2\x80\x99s the wagon-track at last.\r\nNow we shall get along better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wedding subject was no further dwelt upon; and soon a faint\r\ndiverging path was reached, where they parted company, Olly first\r\nbegging her companion to remind Mr. Wildeve that he had not sent her\r\nsick husband the bottle of wine promised on the occasion of his\r\nmarriage. The besom-maker turned to the left towards her own house,\r\nbehind a spur of the hill, and Mrs. Yeobright followed the straight\r\ntrack, which further on joined the highway by the Quiet Woman Inn,\r\nwhither she supposed her niece to have returned with Wildeve from their\r\nwedding at Anglebury that day.\r\n\r\nShe first reached Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s Patch, as it was called, a plot of land\r\nredeemed from the heath, and after long and laborious years brought\r\ninto cultivation. The man who had discovered that it could be tilled\r\ndied of the labour; the man who succeeded him in possession ruined\r\nhimself in fertilizing it. Wildeve came like Amerigo Vespucci, and\r\nreceived the honours due to those who had gone before.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Yeobright had drawn near to the inn, and was about to enter,\r\nshe saw a horse and vehicle some two hundred yards beyond it, coming\r\ntowards her, a man walking alongside with a lantern in his hand. It was\r\nsoon evident that this was the reddleman who had inquired for her.\r\nInstead of entering the inn at once, she walked by it and towards the\r\nvan.\r\n\r\nThe conveyance came close, and the man was about to pass her with\r\nlittle notice, when she turned to him and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI think you have been\r\ninquiring for me? I am Mrs. Yeobright of Blooms-End.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reddleman started, and held up his finger. He stopped the horses,\r\nand beckoned to her to withdraw with him a few yards aside, which she\r\ndid, wondering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, I do! You are young Venn\xe2\x80\x94your father\r\nwas a dairyman somewhere here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and I knew your niece, Miss Tamsin, a little. I have something\r\nbad to tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout her\xe2\x80\x94no! She has just come home, I believe, with her husband.\r\nThey arranged to return this afternoon\xe2\x80\x94to the inn beyond here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause she\xe2\x80\x99s here. She\xe2\x80\x99s in my van,\xe2\x80\x9d he added slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat new trouble has come?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mrs. Yeobright, putting her hand\r\nover her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t explain much, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. All I know is that, as I was going along\r\nthe road this morning, about a mile out of Anglebury, I heard something\r\ntrotting after me like a doe, and looking round there she was, white as\r\ndeath itself. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, Diggory Venn!\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98I thought \xe2\x80\x99twas you\xe2\x80\x94will\r\nyou help me? I am in trouble.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did she know your Christian name?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright doubtingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had met her as a lad before I went away in this trade. She asked\r\nthen if she might ride, and then down she fell in a faint. I picked her\r\nup and put her in, and there she has been ever since. She has cried a\r\ngood deal, but she has hardly spoke; all she has told me being that she\r\nwas to have been married this morning. I tried to get her to eat\r\nsomething, but she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t; and at last she fell asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see her at once,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright, hastening towards the\r\nvan.\r\n\r\nThe reddleman followed with the lantern, and, stepping up first,\r\nassisted Mrs. Yeobright to mount beside him. On the door being opened\r\nshe perceived at the end of the van an extemporized couch, around which\r\nwas hung apparently all the drapery that the reddleman possessed, to\r\nkeep the occupant of the little couch from contact with the red\r\nmaterials of his trade. A young girl lay thereon, covered with a cloak.\r\nShe was asleep, and the light of the lantern fell upon her features.\r\n\r\nA fair, sweet, and honest country face was revealed, reposing in a nest\r\nof wavy chestnut hair. It was between pretty and beautiful. Though her\r\neyes were closed, one could easily imagine the light necessarily\r\nshining in them as the culmination of the luminous workmanship around.\r\nThe groundwork of the face was hopefulness; but over it now lay like a\r\nforeign substance a film of anxiety and grief. The grief had been there\r\nso shortly as to have abstracted nothing of the bloom, and had as yet\r\nbut given a dignity to what it might eventually undermine. The scarlet\r\nof her lips had not had time to abate, and just now it appeared still\r\nmore intense by the absence of the neighbouring and more transient\r\ncolour of her cheek. The lips frequently parted, with a murmur of\r\nwords. She seemed to belong rightly to a madrigal\xe2\x80\x94to require viewing\r\nthrough rhyme and harmony.\r\n\r\nOne thing at least was obvious: she was not made to be looked at thus.\r\nThe reddleman had appeared conscious of as much, and, while Mrs.\r\nYeobright looked in upon her, he cast his eyes aside with a delicacy\r\nwhich well became him. The sleeper apparently thought so too, for the\r\nnext moment she opened her own.\r\n\r\nThe lips then parted with something of anticipation, something more of\r\ndoubt; and her several thoughts and fractions of thoughts, as signalled\r\nby the changes on her face, were exhibited by the light to the utmost\r\nnicety. An ingenuous, transparent life was disclosed, as if the flow of\r\nher existence could be seen passing within her. She understood the\r\nscene in a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes, it is I, Aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI know how frightened you are, and\r\nhow you cannot believe it; but all the same, it is I who have come home\r\nlike this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTamsin, Tamsin!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright, stooping over the young woman\r\nand kissing her. \xe2\x80\x9cO my dear girl!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThomasin was now on the verge of a sob, but by an unexpected\r\nself-command she uttered no sound. With a gentle panting breath she sat\r\nupright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not expect to see you in this state, any more than you me,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwent on quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere am I, Aunt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNearly home, my dear. In Egdon Bottom. What dreadful thing is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you in a moment. So near, are we? Then I will get out and\r\nwalk. I want to go home by the path.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this kind man who has done so much will, I am sure, take you right\r\non to my house?\xe2\x80\x9d said the aunt, turning to the reddleman, who had\r\nwithdrawn from the front of the van on the awakening of the girl, and\r\nstood in the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you think it necessary to ask me? I will, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is indeed kind,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Thomasin. \xe2\x80\x9cI was once acquainted with\r\nhim, Aunt, and when I saw him today I thought I should prefer his van\r\nto any conveyance of a stranger. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll walk now. Reddleman, stop the\r\nhorses, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man regarded her with tender reluctance, but stopped them\r\n\r\nAunt and niece then descended from the van, Mrs. Yeobright saying to\r\nits owner, \xe2\x80\x9cI quite recognize you now. What made you change from the\r\nnice business your father left you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I did,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and looked at Thomasin, who blushed a little.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99ll not be wanting me any more tonight, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Yeobright glanced around at the dark sky, at the hills, at the\r\nperishing bonfires, and at the lighted window of the inn they had\r\nneared. \xe2\x80\x9cI think not,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9csince Thomasin wishes to walk. We can\r\nsoon run up the path and reach home\xe2\x80\x94we know it well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd after a few further words they parted, the reddleman moving onwards\r\nwith his van, and the two women remaining standing in the road. As soon\r\nas the vehicle and its driver had withdrawn so far as to be beyond all\r\npossible reach of her voice, Mrs. Yeobright turned to her niece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Thomasin,\xe2\x80\x9d she said sternly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the meaning of this\r\ndisgraceful performance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\nPerplexity among Honest People\r\n\r\n\r\nThomasin looked as if quite overcome by her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s change of manner.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt means just what it seems to mean: I am\xe2\x80\x94not married,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied\r\nfaintly. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me\xe2\x80\x94for humiliating you, Aunt, by this mishap\xe2\x80\x94I am\r\nsorry for it. But I cannot help it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe? Think of yourself first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was nobody\xe2\x80\x99s fault. When we got there the parson wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t marry us\r\nbecause of some trifling irregularity in the license.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat irregularity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Mr. Wildeve can explain. I did not think when I went\r\naway this morning that I should come back like this.\xe2\x80\x9d It being dark,\r\nThomasin allowed her emotion to escape her by the silent way of tears,\r\nwhich could roll down her cheek unseen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could almost say that it serves you right\xe2\x80\x94if I did not feel that you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t deserve it,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mrs. Yeobright, who, possessing two\r\ndistinct moods in close contiguity, a gentle mood and an angry, flew\r\nfrom one to the other without the least warning. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember, Thomasin,\r\nthis business was none of my seeking; from the very first, when you\r\nbegan to feel foolish about that man, I warned you he would not make\r\nyou happy. I felt it so strongly that I did what I would never have\r\nbelieved myself capable of doing\xe2\x80\x94stood up in the church, and made\r\nmyself the public talk for weeks. But having once consented, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsubmit to these fancies without good reason. Marry him you must after\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I wish to do otherwise for one moment?\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomasin,\r\nwith a heavy sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cI know how wrong it was of me to love him, but\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t pain me by talking like that, Aunt! You would not have had me\r\nstay there with him, would you?\xe2\x80\x94and your house is the only home I have\r\nto return to. He says we can be married in a day or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish he had never seen you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; then I will be the miserablest woman in the world, and not\r\nlet him see me again. No, I won\xe2\x80\x99t have him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is too late to speak so. Come with me. I am going to the inn to see\r\nif he has returned. Of course I shall get to the bottom of this story\r\nat once. Mr. Wildeve must not suppose he can play tricks upon me, or\r\nany belonging to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not that. The license was wrong, and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get another\r\nthe same day. He will tell you in a moment how it was, if he comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t he bring you back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was me!\xe2\x80\x9d again sobbed Thomasin. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I found we could not be\r\nmarried I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to come back with him, and I was very ill. Then I\r\nsaw Diggory Venn, and was glad to get him to take me home. I cannot\r\nexplain it any better, and you must be angry with me if you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall see about that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright; and they turned towards\r\nthe inn, known in the neighbourhood as the Quiet Woman, the sign of\r\nwhich represented the figure of a matron carrying her head under her\r\narm. The front of the house was towards the heath and Rainbarrow, whose\r\ndark shape seemed to threaten it from the sky. Upon the door was a\r\nneglected brass plate, bearing the unexpected inscription, \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nWildeve, Engineer\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a useless yet cherished relic from the time when he\r\nhad been started in that profession in an office at Budmouth by those\r\nwho had hoped much from him, and had been disappointed. The garden was\r\nat the back, and behind this ran a still deep stream, forming the\r\nmargin of the heath in that direction, meadow-land appearing beyond the\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nBut the thick obscurity permitted only skylines to be visible of any\r\nscene at present. The water at the back of the house could be heard,\r\nidly spinning whirpools in its creep between the rows of dry\r\nfeather-headed reeds which formed a stockade along each bank. Their\r\npresence was denoted by sounds as of a congregation praying humbly,\r\nproduced by their rubbing against each other in the slow wind.\r\n\r\nThe window, whence the candlelight had shone up the vale to the eyes of\r\nthe bonfire group, was uncurtained, but the sill lay too high for a\r\npedestrian on the outside to look over it into the room. A vast shadow,\r\nin which could be dimly traced portions of a masculine contour, blotted\r\nhalf the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seems to be at home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust I come in, too, Aunt?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Thomasin faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose not; it\r\nwould be wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must come, certainly\xe2\x80\x94to confront him, so that he may make no false\r\nrepresentations to me. We shall not be five minutes in the house, and\r\nthen we\xe2\x80\x99ll walk home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEntering the open passage, she tapped at the door of the private\r\nparlour, unfastened it, and looked in.\r\n\r\nThe back and shoulders of a man came between Mrs. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and\r\nthe fire. Wildeve, whose form it was, immediately turned, arose, and\r\nadvanced to meet his visitors.\r\n\r\nHe was quite a young man, and of the two properties, form and motion,\r\nthe latter first attracted the eye in him. The grace of his movement\r\nwas singular\xe2\x80\x94it was the pantomimic expression of a lady-killing career.\r\nNext came into notice the more material qualities, among which was a\r\nprofuse crop of hair impending over the top of his face, lending to his\r\nforehead the high-cornered outline of an early Gothic shield; and a\r\nneck which was smooth and round as a cylinder. The lower half of his\r\nfigure was of light build. Altogether he was one in whom no man would\r\nhave seen anything to admire, and in whom no woman would have seen\r\nanything to dislike.\r\n\r\nHe discerned the young girl\xe2\x80\x99s form in the passage, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThomasin,\r\nthen, has reached home. How could you leave me in that way, darling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd turning to Mrs. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIt was useless to argue with her. She\r\nwould go, and go alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what\xe2\x80\x99s the meaning of it all?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Mrs. Yeobright haughtily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake a seat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve, placing chairs for the two women. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nit was a very stupid mistake, but such mistakes will happen. The\r\nlicense was useless at Anglebury. It was made out for Budmouth, but as\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t read it I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t aware of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you had been staying at Anglebury?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I had been at Budmouth\xe2\x80\x94till two days ago\xe2\x80\x94and that was where I had\r\nintended to take her; but when I came to fetch her we decided upon\r\nAnglebury, forgetting that a new license would be necessary. There was\r\nnot time to get to Budmouth afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you are very much to blame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was quite my fault we chose Anglebury,\xe2\x80\x9d Thomasin pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nproposed it because I was not known there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know so well that I am to blame that you need not remind me of it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied Wildeve shortly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch things don\xe2\x80\x99t happen for nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the aunt. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a great\r\nslight to me and my family; and when it gets known there will be a very\r\nunpleasant time for us. How can she look her friends in the face\r\ntomorrow? It is a very great injury, and one I cannot easily forgive.\r\nIt may even reflect on her character.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve.\r\n\r\nThomasin\xe2\x80\x99s large eyes had flown from the face of one to the face of the\r\nother during this discussion, and she now said anxiously, \xe2\x80\x9cWill you\r\nallow me, Aunt, to talk it over alone with Damon for five minutes? Will\r\nyou, Damon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve, \xe2\x80\x9cif your aunt will excuse us.\xe2\x80\x9d He led\r\nher into an adjoining room, leaving Mrs. Yeobright by the fire.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were alone, and the door closed, Thomasin said, turning\r\nup her pale, tearful face to him, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is killing me, this, Damon! I did\r\nnot mean to part from you in anger at Anglebury this morning; but I was\r\nfrightened and hardly knew what I said. I\xe2\x80\x99ve not let Aunt know how much\r\nI suffered today; and it is so hard to command my face and voice, and\r\nto smile as if it were a slight thing to me; but I try to do so, that\r\nshe may not be still more indignant with you. I know you could not help\r\nit, dear, whatever Aunt may think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is very unpleasant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Thomasin murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cand I suppose I seem so now.... Damon, what\r\ndo you mean to do about me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo about you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Those who don\xe2\x80\x99t like you whisper things which at moments make me\r\ndoubt you. We mean to marry, I suppose, don\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course we do. We have only to go to Budmouth on Monday, and we\r\nmarry at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen do let us go!\xe2\x80\x94O Damon, what you make me say!\xe2\x80\x9d She hid her face in\r\nher handkerchief. \xe2\x80\x9cHere am I asking you to marry me, when by rights you\r\nought to be on your knees imploring me, your cruel mistress, not to\r\nrefuse you, and saying it would break your heart if I did. I used to\r\nthink it would be pretty and sweet like that; but how different!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, real life is never at all like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t care personally if it never takes place,\xe2\x80\x9d she added with a\r\nlittle dignity; \xe2\x80\x9cno, I can live without you. It is Aunt I think of. She\r\nis so proud, and thinks so much of her family respectability, that she\r\nwill be cut down with mortification if this story should get abroad\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94it is done. My cousin Clym, too, will be much wounded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he will be very unreasonable. In fact, you are all rather\r\nunreasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThomasin coloured a little, and not with love. But whatever the\r\nmomentary feeling which caused that flush in her, it went as it came,\r\nand she humbly said, \xe2\x80\x9cI never mean to be, if I can help it. I merely\r\nfeel that you have my aunt to some extent in your power at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a matter of justice it is almost due to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve. \xe2\x80\x9cThink\r\nwhat I have gone through to win her consent; the insult that it is to\r\nany man to have the banns forbidden\xe2\x80\x94the double insult to a man unlucky\r\nenough to be cursed with sensitiveness, and blue demons, and Heaven\r\nknows what, as I am. I can never forget those banns. A harsher man\r\nwould rejoice now in the power I have of turning upon your aunt by\r\ngoing no further in the business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked wistfully at him with her sorrowful eyes as he said those\r\nwords, and her aspect showed that more than one person in the room\r\ncould deplore the possession of sensitiveness. Seeing that she was\r\nreally suffering he seemed disturbed and added, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is merely a\r\nreflection you know. I have not the least intention to refuse to\r\ncomplete the marriage, Tamsie mine\xe2\x80\x94I could not bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou could not, I know!\xe2\x80\x9d said the fair girl, brightening. \xe2\x80\x9cYou, who\r\ncannot bear the sight of pain in even an insect, or any disagreeable\r\nsound, or unpleasant smell even, will not long cause pain to me and\r\nmine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not, if I can help it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour hand upon it, Damon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe carelessly gave her his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, by my crown, what\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d he said suddenly.\r\n\r\nThere fell upon their ears the sound of numerous voices singing in\r\nfront of the house. Among these, two made themselves prominent by their\r\npeculiarity: one was a very strong bass, the other a wheezy thin\r\npiping. Thomasin recognized them as belonging to Timothy Fairway and\r\nGrandfer Cantle respectively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it mean\xe2\x80\x94it is not skimmity-riding, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a\r\nfrightened gaze at Wildeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not; no, it is that the heath-folk have come to sing to us a\r\nwelcome. This is intolerable!\xe2\x80\x9d He began pacing about, the men outside\r\nsinging cheerily\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told\xe2\x80\xb2 her that she\xe2\x80\xb2 was the joy\xe2\x80\xb2 of his life\xe2\x80\xb2,\r\nAnd if\xe2\x80\xb2 she\xe2\x80\x99d con-sent\xe2\x80\xb2 he would make her his wife\xe2\x80\xb2;\r\nShe could\xe2\x80\xb2 not refuse\xe2\x80\xb2 him; to church\xe2\x80\xb2 so they went\xe2\x80\xb2,\r\nYoung Will was forgot\xe2\x80\xb2, and young Sue\xe2\x80\xb2 was content\xe2\x80\xb2;\r\nAnd then\xe2\x80\xb2 was she kiss\xe2\x80\x99d\xe2\x80\xb2 and set down\xe2\x80\xb2 on his knee\xe2\x80\xb2,\r\nNo man\xe2\x80\xb2 in the world\xe2\x80\xb2 was so lov\xe2\x80\xb2-ing as he\xe2\x80\xb2!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Yeobright burst in from the outer room. \xe2\x80\x9cThomasin, Thomasin!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, looking indignantly at Wildeve; \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty exposure! Let us\r\nescape at once. Come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was, however, too late to get away by the passage. A rugged knocking\r\nhad begun upon the door of the front room. Wildeve, who had gone to the\r\nwindow, came back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d he said imperiously, putting his hand upon Mrs. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narm. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are regularly besieged. There are fifty of them out there if\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s one. You stay in this room with Thomasin; I\xe2\x80\x99ll go out and face\r\nthem. You must stay now, for my sake, till they are gone, so that it\r\nmay seem as if all was right. Come, Tamsie dear, don\xe2\x80\x99t go making a\r\nscene\xe2\x80\x94we must marry after this; that you can see as well as I. Sit\r\nstill, that\xe2\x80\x99s all\xe2\x80\x94and don\xe2\x80\x99t speak much. I\xe2\x80\x99ll manage them. Blundering\r\nfools!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pressed the agitated girl into a seat, returned to the outer room\r\nand opened the door. Immediately outside, in the passage, appeared\r\nGrandfer Cantle singing in concert with those still standing in front\r\nof the house. He came into the room and nodded abstractedly to Wildeve,\r\nhis lips still parted, and his features excruciatingly strained in the\r\nemission of the chorus. This being ended, he said heartily, \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwelcome to the new-made couple, and God bless \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve, with dry resentment, his face as gloomy as a\r\nthunderstorm.\r\n\r\nAt the Grandfer\xe2\x80\x99s heels now came the rest of the group, which included\r\nFairway, Christian, Sam the turf-cutter, Humphrey, and a dozen others.\r\nAll smiled upon Wildeve, and upon his tables and chairs likewise, from\r\na general sense of friendliness towards the articles as well as towards\r\ntheir owner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe be not here afore Mrs. Yeobright after all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway,\r\nrecognizing the matron\xe2\x80\x99s bonnet through the glass partition which\r\ndivided the public apartment they had entered from the room where the\r\nwomen sat. \xe2\x80\x9cWe struck down across, d\xe2\x80\x99ye see, Mr. Wildeve, and she went\r\nround by the path.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I see the young bride\xe2\x80\x99s little head!\xe2\x80\x9d said Grandfer, peeping in\r\nthe same direction, and discerning Thomasin, who was waiting beside her\r\naunt in a miserable and awkward way. \xe2\x80\x9cNot quite settled in yet\xe2\x80\x94well,\r\nwell, there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWildeve made no reply; and probably feeling that the sooner he treated\r\nthem the sooner they would go, he produced a stone jar, which threw a\r\nwarm halo over matters at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a drop of the right sort, I can see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grandfer Cantle,\r\nwith the air of a man too well-mannered to show any hurry to taste it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tis some old mead. I hope you will like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO ay!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the guests, in the hearty tones natural when the words\r\ndemanded by politeness coincide with those of deepest feeling. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t a prettier drink under the sun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take my oath there isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d added Grandfer Cantle. \xe2\x80\x9cAll that can\r\nbe said against mead is that \xe2\x80\x99tis rather heady, and apt to lie about a\r\nman a good while. But tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s Sunday, thank God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel\xe2\x80\x99d for all the world like some bold soldier after I had had some\r\nonce,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall feel so again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve, with condescension, \xe2\x80\x9cCups or\r\nglasses, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have the beaker, and pass \xe2\x80\x99en round;\r\n\xe2\x80\x99tis better than heling it out in dribbles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJown the slippery glasses,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grandfer Cantle. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of\r\na thing that you can\xe2\x80\x99t put down in the ashes to warm, hey, neighbours;\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what I ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight, Grandfer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam; and the mead then circulated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Timothy Fairway, feeling demands upon his praise in some\r\nform or other, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tis a worthy thing to be married, Mr. Wildeve; and the\r\nwoman you\xe2\x80\x99ve got is a dimant, so says I. Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, to\r\nGrandfer Cantle, raising his voice so as to be heard through the\r\npartition, \xe2\x80\x9cher father (inclining his head towards the inner room) was\r\nas good a feller as ever lived. He always had his great indignation\r\nready against anything underhand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that very dangerous?\xe2\x80\x9d said Christian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there were few in these parts that were upsides with him,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSam. \xe2\x80\x9cWhenever a club walked he\xe2\x80\x99d play the clarinet in the band that\r\nmarched before \xe2\x80\x99em as if he\xe2\x80\x99d never touched anything but a clarinet all\r\nhis life. And then, when they got to church door he\xe2\x80\x99d throw down the\r\nclarinet, mount the gallery, snatch up the bass viol, and rozum away as\r\nif he\xe2\x80\x99d never played anything but a bass viol. Folk would say\xe2\x80\x94folk that\r\nknowed what a true stave was\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Surely, surely that\xe2\x80\x99s never the same man\r\nthat I saw handling the clarinet so masterly by now!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can mind it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the furze-cutter. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas a wonderful thing that\r\none body could hold it all and never mix the fingering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was Kingsbere church likewise,\xe2\x80\x9d Fairway recommenced, as one\r\nopening a new vein of the same mine of interest.\r\n\r\nWildeve breathed the breath of one intolerably bored, and glanced\r\nthrough the partition at the prisoners.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe used to walk over there of a Sunday afternoon to visit his old\r\nacquaintance Andrew Brown, the first clarinet there; a good man enough,\r\nbut rather screechy in his music, if you can mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99A was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd neighbour Yeobright would take Andrey\xe2\x80\x99s place for some part of the\r\nservice, to let Andrey have a bit of a nap, as any friend would\r\nnaturally do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs any friend would,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grandfer Cantle, the other listeners\r\nexpressing the same accord by the shorter way of nodding their heads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo sooner was Andrey asleep and the first whiff of neighbour\r\nYeobright\xe2\x80\x99s wind had got inside Andrey\xe2\x80\x99s clarinet than everyone in\r\nchurch feeled in a moment there was a great soul among \xe2\x80\x99em. All heads\r\nwould turn, and they\xe2\x80\x99d say, \xe2\x80\x98Ah, I thought \xe2\x80\x99twas he!\xe2\x80\x99 One Sunday I can\r\nwell mind\xe2\x80\x94a bass viol day that time, and Yeobright had brought his own.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas the Hundred-and-thirty-third to \xe2\x80\x98Lydia\xe2\x80\x99; and when they\xe2\x80\x99d come to\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ran down his beard and o\xe2\x80\x99er his robes its costly moisture shed,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nneighbour Yeobright, who had just warmed to his work, drove his bow\r\ninto them strings that glorious grand that he e\xe2\x80\x99en a\xe2\x80\x99most sawed the\r\nbass viol into two pieces. Every winder in church rattled as if \xe2\x80\x99twere\r\na thunderstorm. Old Pa\xe2\x80\x99son Williams lifted his hands in his great holy\r\nsurplice as natural as if he\xe2\x80\x99d been in common clothes, and seemed to\r\nsay hisself, \xe2\x80\x98Oh for such a man in our parish!\xe2\x80\x99 But not a soul in\r\nKingsbere could hold a candle to Yeobright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it quite safe when the winder shook?\xe2\x80\x9d Christian inquired.\r\n\r\nHe received no answer, all for the moment sitting rapt in admiration of\r\nthe performance described. As with Farinelli\xe2\x80\x99s singing before the\r\nprincesses, Sheridan\xe2\x80\x99s renowned Begum Speech, and other such examples,\r\nthe fortunate condition of its being for ever lost to the world\r\ninvested the deceased Mr. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s tour de force on that memorable\r\nafternoon with a cumulative glory which comparative criticism, had that\r\nbeen possible, might considerably have shorn down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was the last you\xe2\x80\x99d have expected to drop off in the prime of life,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Humphrey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well; he was looking for the earth some months afore he went. At\r\nthat time women used to run for smocks and gown-pieces at Greenhill\r\nFair, and my wife that is now, being a long-legged slittering maid,\r\nhardly husband-high, went with the rest of the maidens, for \xe2\x80\x99a was a\r\ngood runner afore she got so heavy. When she came home I said\xe2\x80\x94we were\r\nthen just beginning to walk together\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98What have ye got, my honey?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve won\xe2\x80\x94well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve won\xe2\x80\x94a gown-piece,\xe2\x80\x99 says she, her colours coming up\r\nin a moment. \xe2\x80\x99Tis a smock for a crown, I thought; and so it turned out.\r\nAy, when I think what she\xe2\x80\x99ll say to me now without a mossel of red in\r\nher face, it do seem strange that \xe2\x80\x99a wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say such a little thing\r\nthen.... However, then she went on, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what made me bring up\r\nthe story, \xe2\x80\x98Well, whatever clothes I\xe2\x80\x99ve won, white or figured, for eyes\r\nto see or for eyes not to see\xe2\x80\x99 (\xe2\x80\x99a could do a pretty stroke of modesty\r\nin those days), \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner have lost it than have seen what I have.\r\nPoor Mr. Yeobright was took bad directly he reached the fair ground,\r\nand was forced to go home again.\xe2\x80\x99 That was the last time he ever went\r\nout of the parish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99A faltered on from one day to another, and then we heard he was\r\ngone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99ye think he had great pain when \xe2\x80\x99a died?\xe2\x80\x9d said Christian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no\xe2\x80\x94quite different. Nor any pain of mind. He was lucky enough to be\r\nGod A\xe2\x80\x99mighty\xe2\x80\x99s own man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd other folk\xe2\x80\x94d\xe2\x80\x99ye think \xe2\x80\x99twill be much pain to \xe2\x80\x99em, Mister Fairway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat depends on whether they be afeard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bain\xe2\x80\x99t afeard at all, I thank God!\xe2\x80\x9d said Christian strenuously. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nglad I bain\xe2\x80\x99t, for then \xe2\x80\x99twon\xe2\x80\x99t pain me.... I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I be\r\nafeard\xe2\x80\x94or if I be I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve to suffer. I\r\nwish I was not afeard at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a solemn silence, and looking from the window, which was\r\nunshuttered and unblinded, Timothy said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what a fess little\r\nbonfire that one is, out by Cap\xe2\x80\x99n Vye\xe2\x80\x99s! \xe2\x80\x99Tis burning just the same now\r\nas ever, upon my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll glances went through the window, and nobody noticed that Wildeve\r\ndisguised a brief, telltale look. Far away up the sombre valley of\r\nheath, and to the right of Rainbarrow, could indeed be seen the light,\r\nsmall, but steady and persistent as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was lighted before ours was,\xe2\x80\x9d Fairway continued; \xe2\x80\x9cand yet every one\r\nin the country round is out afore \xe2\x80\x99n.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps there\xe2\x80\x99s meaning in it!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Christian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow meaning?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve sharply.\r\n\r\nChristian was too scattered to reply, and Timothy helped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe means, sir, that the lonesome dark-eyed creature up there that some\r\nsay is a witch\xe2\x80\x94ever I should call a fine young woman such a name\xe2\x80\x94is\r\nalways up to some odd conceit or other; and so perhaps \xe2\x80\x99tis she.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d be very glad to ask her in wedlock, if she\xe2\x80\x99d hae me and take the\r\nrisk of her wild dark eyes ill-wishing me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grandfer Cantle\r\nstaunchly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ye say it, Father!\xe2\x80\x9d implored Christian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, be dazed if he who do marry the maid won\xe2\x80\x99t hae an uncommon\r\npicture for his best parlour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway in a liquid tone, placing\r\ndown the cup of mead at the end of a good pull.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a partner as deep as the North Star,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, taking up the cup\r\nand finishing the little that remained. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, really, now I think we\r\nmust be moving,\xe2\x80\x9d said Humphrey, observing the emptiness of the vessel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we\xe2\x80\x99ll gie \xe2\x80\x99em another song?\xe2\x80\x9d said Grandfer Cantle. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m as full of\r\nnotes as a bird!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Grandfer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we will not trouble you now.\r\nSome other day must do for that\xe2\x80\x94when I have a party.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe jown\xe2\x80\x99d if I don\xe2\x80\x99t learn ten new songs for\xe2\x80\x99t, or I won\xe2\x80\x99t learn a\r\nline!\xe2\x80\x9d said Grandfer Cantle. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you may be sure I won\xe2\x80\x99t disappoint ye\r\nby biding away, Mr. Wildeve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite believe you,\xe2\x80\x9d said that gentleman.\r\n\r\nAll then took their leave, wishing their entertainer long life and\r\nhappiness as a married man, with recapitulations which occupied some\r\ntime. Wildeve attended them to the door, beyond which the deep-dyed\r\nupward stretch of heath stood awaiting them, an amplitude of darkness\r\nreigning from their feet almost to the zenith, where a definite form\r\nfirst became visible in the lowering forehead of Rainbarrow. Diving\r\ninto the dense obscurity in a line headed by Sam the turf-cutter, they\r\npursued their trackless way home.\r\n\r\nWhen the scratching of the furze against their leggings had fainted\r\nupon the ear, Wildeve returned to the room where he had left Thomasin\r\nand her aunt. The women were gone.\r\n\r\nThey could only have left the house in one way, by the back window; and\r\nthis was open.\r\n\r\nWildeve laughed to himself, remained a moment thinking, and idly\r\nreturned to the front room. Here his glance fell upon a bottle of wine\r\nwhich stood on the mantelpiece. \xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94old Dowden!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured; and going\r\nto the kitchen door shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cIs anybody here who can take something to\r\nold Dowden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no reply. The room was empty, the lad who acted as his\r\nfactotum having gone to bed. Wildeve came back, put on his hat, took\r\nthe bottle, and left the house, turning the key in the door, for there\r\nwas no guest at the inn tonight. As soon as he was on the road the\r\nlittle bonfire on Mistover Knap again met his eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill waiting, are you, my lady?\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\nHowever, he did not proceed that way just then; but leaving the hill to\r\nthe left of him, he stumbled over a rutted road that brought him to a\r\ncottage which, like all other habitations on the heath at this hour,\r\nwas only saved from being visible by a faint shine from its bedroom\r\nwindow. This house was the home of Olly Dowden, the besom-maker, and he\r\nentered.\r\n\r\nThe lower room was in darkness; but by feeling his way he found a\r\ntable, whereon he placed the bottle, and a minute later emerged again\r\nupon the heath. He stood and looked northeast at the undying little\r\nfire\xe2\x80\x94high up above him, though not so high as Rainbarrow.\r\n\r\nWe have been told what happens when a woman deliberates; and the\r\nepigram is not always terminable with woman, provided that one be in\r\nthe case, and that a fair one. Wildeve stood, and stood longer, and\r\nbreathed perplexedly, and then said to himself with resignation,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94by Heaven, I must go to her, I suppose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of turning in the direction of home he pressed on rapidly by a\r\npath under Rainbarrow towards what was evidently a signal light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\nThe Figure against the Sky\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the whole Egdon concourse had left the site of the bonfire to its\r\naccustomed loneliness, a closely wrapped female figure approached the\r\nbarrow from that quarter of the heath in which the little fire lay. Had\r\nthe reddleman been watching he might have recognized her as the woman\r\nwho had first stood there so singularly, and vanished at the approach\r\nof strangers. She ascended to her old position at the top, where the\r\nred coals of the perishing fire greeted her like living eyes in the\r\ncorpse of day. There she stood still around her stretching the vast\r\nnight atmosphere, whose incomplete darkness in comparison with the\r\ntotal darkness of the heath below it might have represented a venial\r\nbeside a mortal sin.\r\n\r\nThat she was tall and straight in build, that she was lady-like in her\r\nmovements, was all that could be learnt of her just now, her form being\r\nwrapped in a shawl folded in the old cornerwise fashion, and her head\r\nin a large kerchief, a protection not superfluous at this hour and\r\nplace. Her back was towards the wind, which blew from the northwest;\r\nbut whether she had avoided that aspect because of the chilly gusts\r\nwhich played about her exceptional position, or because her interest\r\nlay in the southeast, did not at first appear.\r\n\r\nHer reason for standing so dead still as the pivot of this circle of\r\nheath-country was just as obscure. Her extraordinary fixity, her\r\nconspicuous loneliness, her heedlessness of night, betokened among\r\nother things an utter absence of fear. A tract of country unaltered\r\nfrom that sinister condition which made C\xc3\xa6sar anxious every year to get\r\nclear of its glooms before the autumnal equinox, a kind of landscape\r\nand weather which leads travellers from the South to describe our\r\nisland as Homer\xe2\x80\x99s Cimmerian land, was not, on the face of it, friendly\r\nto women.\r\n\r\nIt might reasonably have been supposed that she was listening to the\r\nwind, which rose somewhat as the night advanced, and laid hold of the\r\nattention. The wind, indeed, seemed made for the scene, as the scene\r\nseemed made for the hour. Part of its tone was quite special; what was\r\nheard there could be heard nowhere else. Gusts in innumerable series\r\nfollowed each other from the northwest, and when each one of them raced\r\npast the sound of its progress resolved into three. Treble, tenor, and\r\nbass notes were to be found therein. The general ricochet of the whole\r\nover pits and prominences had the gravest pitch of the chime. Next\r\nthere could be heard the baritone buzz of a holly tree. Below these in\r\nforce, above them in pitch, a dwindled voice strove hard at a husky\r\ntune, which was the peculiar local sound alluded to. Thinner and less\r\nimmediately traceable than the other two, it was far more impressive\r\nthan either. In it lay what may be called the linguistic peculiarity of\r\nthe heath; and being audible nowhere on earth off a heath, it afforded\r\na shadow of reason for the woman\xe2\x80\x99s tenseness, which continued as\r\nunbroken as ever.\r\n\r\nThroughout the blowing of these plaintive November winds that note bore\r\na great resemblance to the ruins of human song which remain to the\r\nthroat of fourscore and ten. It was a worn whisper, dry and papery, and\r\nit brushed so distinctly across the ear that, by the accustomed, the\r\nmaterial minuti\xc3\xa6 in which it originated could be realized as by touch.\r\nIt was the united products of infinitesimal vegetable causes, and these\r\nwere neither stems, leaves, fruit, blades, prickles, lichen, nor moss.\r\n\r\nThey were the mummied heathbells of the past summer, originally tender\r\nand purple, now washed colourless by Michaelmas rains, and dried to\r\ndead skins by October suns. So low was an individual sound from these\r\nthat a combination of hundreds only just emerged from silence, and the\r\nmyriads of the whole declivity reached the woman\xe2\x80\x99s ear but as a\r\nshrivelled and intermittent recitative. Yet scarcely a single accent\r\namong the many afloat tonight could have such power to impress a\r\nlistener with thoughts of its origin. One inwardly saw the infinity of\r\nthose combined multitudes; and perceived that each of the tiny trumpets\r\nwas seized on entered, scoured and emerged from by the wind as\r\nthoroughly as if it were as vast as a crater.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe spirit moved them.\xe2\x80\x9d A meaning of the phrase forced itself upon the\r\nattention; and an emotional listener\xe2\x80\x99s fetichistic mood might have\r\nended in one of more advanced quality. It was not, after all, that the\r\nleft-hand expanse of old blooms spoke, or the right-hand, or those of\r\nthe slope in front; but it was the single person of something else\r\nspeaking through each at once.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, on the barrow, there mingled with all this wild rhetoric of\r\nnight a sound which modulated so naturally into the rest that its\r\nbeginning and ending were hardly to be distinguished. The bluffs, and\r\nthe bushes, and the heather-bells had broken silence; at last, so did\r\nthe woman; and her articulation was but as another phrase of the same\r\ndiscourse as theirs. Thrown out on the winds it became twined in with\r\nthem, and with them it flew away.\r\n\r\nWhat she uttered was a lengthened sighing, apparently at something in\r\nher mind which had led to her presence here. There was a spasmodic\r\nabandonment about it as if, in allowing herself to utter the sound the\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s brain had authorized what it could not regulate. One point was\r\nevident in this; that she had been existing in a suppressed state, and\r\nnot in one of languor, or stagnation.\r\n\r\nFar away down the valley the faint shine from the window of the inn\r\nstill lasted on; and a few additional moments proved that the window,\r\nor what was within it, had more to do with the woman\xe2\x80\x99s sigh than had\r\neither her own actions or the scene immediately around. She lifted her\r\nleft hand, which held a closed telescope. This she rapidly extended, as\r\nif she were well accustomed to the operation, and raising it to her eye\r\ndirected it towards the light beaming from the inn.\r\n\r\nThe handkerchief which had hooded her head was now a little thrown\r\nback, her face being somewhat elevated. A profile was visible against\r\nthe dull monochrome of cloud around her; and it was as though side\r\nshadows from the features of Sappho and Mrs. Siddons had converged\r\nupwards from the tomb to form an image like neither but suggesting\r\nboth. This, however, was mere superficiality. In respect of character a\r\nface may make certain admissions by its outline; but it fully confesses\r\nonly in its changes. So much is this the case that what is called the\r\nplay of the features often helps more in understanding a man or woman\r\nthan the earnest labours of all the other members together. Thus the\r\nnight revealed little of her whose form it was embracing, for the\r\nmobile parts of her countenance could not be seen.\r\n\r\nAt last she gave up her spying attitude, closed the telescope, and\r\nturned to the decaying embers. From these no appreciable beams now\r\nradiated, except when a more than usually smart gust brushed over their\r\nfaces and raised a fitful glow which came and went like the blush of a\r\ngirl. She stooped over the silent circle, and selecting from the brands\r\na piece of stick which bore the largest live coal at its end, brought\r\nit to where she had been standing before.\r\n\r\nShe held the brand to the ground, blowing the red coal with her mouth\r\nat the same time; till it faintly illuminated the sod, and revealed a\r\nsmall object, which turned out to be an hourglass, though she wore a\r\nwatch. She blew long enough to show that the sand had all slipped\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as if surprised.\r\n\r\nThe light raised by her breath had been very fitful, and a momentary\r\nirradiation of flesh was all that it had disclosed of her face. That\r\nconsisted of two matchless lips and a cheek only, her head being still\r\nenveloped. She threw away the stick, took the glass in her hand, the\r\ntelescope under her arm, and moved on.\r\n\r\nAlong the ridge ran a faint foot-track, which the lady followed. Those\r\nwho knew it well called it a path; and, while a mere visitor would have\r\npassed it unnoticed even by day, the regular haunters of the heath were\r\nat no loss for it at midnight. The whole secret of following these\r\nincipient paths, when there was not light enough in the atmosphere to\r\nshow a turnpike road, lay in the development of the sense of touch in\r\nthe feet, which comes with years of night-rambling in little-trodden\r\nspots. To a walker practised in such places a difference between impact\r\non maiden herbage, and on the crippled stalks of a slight footway, is\r\nperceptible through the thickest boot or shoe.\r\n\r\nThe solitary figure who walked this beat took no notice of the windy\r\ntune still played on the dead heathbells. She did not turn her head to\r\nlook at a group of dark creatures further on, who fled from her\r\npresence as she skirted a ravine where they fed. They were about a\r\nscore of the small wild ponies known as heath-croppers. They roamed at\r\nlarge on the undulations of Egdon, but in numbers too few to detract\r\nmuch from the solitude.\r\n\r\nThe pedestrian noticed nothing just now, and a clue to her abstraction\r\nwas afforded by a trivial incident. A bramble caught hold of her skirt,\r\nand checked her progress. Instead of putting it off and hastening\r\nalong, she yielded herself up to the pull, and stood passively still.\r\nWhen she began to extricate herself it was by turning round and round,\r\nand so unwinding the prickly switch. She was in a desponding reverie.\r\n\r\nHer course was in the direction of the small undying fire which had\r\ndrawn the attention of the men on Rainbarrow and of Wildeve in the\r\nvalley below. A faint illumination from its rays began to glow upon her\r\nface, and the fire soon revealed itself to be lit, not on the level\r\nground, but on a salient corner or redan of earth, at the junction of\r\ntwo converging bank fences. Outside was a ditch, dry except immediately\r\nunder the fire, where there was a large pool, bearded all round by\r\nheather and rushes. In the smooth water of the pool the fire appeared\r\nupside down.\r\n\r\nThe banks meeting behind were bare of a hedge, save such as was formed\r\nby disconnected tufts of furze, standing upon stems along the top, like\r\nimpaled heads above a city wall. A white mast, fitted up with spars and\r\nother nautical tackle, could be seen rising against the dark clouds\r\nwhenever the flames played brightly enough to reach it. Altogether the\r\nscene had much the appearance of a fortification upon which had been\r\nkindled a beacon fire.\r\n\r\nNobody was visible; but ever and anon a whitish something moved above\r\nthe bank from behind, and vanished again. This was a small human hand,\r\nin the act of lifting pieces of fuel into the fire, but for all that\r\ncould be seen the hand, like that which troubled Belshazzar, was there\r\nalone. Occasionally an ember rolled off the bank, and dropped with a\r\nhiss into the pool.\r\n\r\nAt one side of the pool rough steps built of clods enabled everyone who\r\nwished to do so to mount the bank; which the woman did. Within was a\r\npaddock in an uncultivated state, though bearing evidence of having\r\nonce been tilled; but the heath and fern had insidiously crept in, and\r\nwere reasserting their old supremacy. Further ahead were dimly visible\r\nan irregular dwelling-house, garden, and outbuildings, backed by a\r\nclump of firs.\r\n\r\nThe young lady\xe2\x80\x94for youth had revealed its presence in her buoyant bound\r\nup the bank\xe2\x80\x94walked along the top instead of descending inside, and came\r\nto the corner where the fire was burning. One reason for the permanence\r\nof the blaze was now manifest: the fuel consisted of hard pieces of\r\nwood, cleft and sawn\xe2\x80\x94the knotty boles of old thorn trees which grew in\r\ntwos and threes about the hillsides. A yet unconsumed pile of these lay\r\nin the inner angle of the bank; and from this corner the upturned face\r\nof a little boy greeted her eyes. He was dilatorily throwing up a piece\r\nof wood into the fire every now and then, a business which seemed to\r\nhave engaged him a considerable part of the evening, for his face was\r\nsomewhat weary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you have come, Miss Eustacia,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a sigh of\r\nrelief. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like biding by myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense. I have only been a little way for a walk. I have been gone\r\nonly twenty minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seemed long,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the sad boy. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have been so many\r\ntimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I thought you would be pleased to have a bonfire. Are you not\r\nmuch obliged to me for making you one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody here to play wi\xe2\x80\x99 me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose nobody has come while I\xe2\x80\x99ve been away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody except your grandfather\xe2\x80\x94he looked out of doors once for \xe2\x80\x99ee. I\r\ntold him you were walking round upon the hill to look at the other\r\nbonfires.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I hear him coming again, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn old man came into the remoter light of the fire from the direction\r\nof the homestead. He was the same who had overtaken the reddleman on\r\nthe road that afternoon. He looked wistfully to the top of the bank at\r\nthe woman who stood there, and his teeth, which were quite unimpaired,\r\nshowed like parian from his parted lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen are you coming indoors, Eustacia?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis almost\r\nbedtime. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been home these two hours, and am tired out. Surely \xe2\x80\x99tis\r\nsomewhat childish of you to stay out playing at bonfires so long, and\r\nwasting such fuel. My precious thorn roots, the rarest of all firing,\r\nthat I laid by on purpose for Christmas\xe2\x80\x94you have burnt \xe2\x80\x99em nearly all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promised Johnny a bonfire, and it pleases him not to let it go out\r\njust yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia, in a way which told at once that she was\r\nabsolute queen here. \xe2\x80\x9cGrandfather, you go in to bed. I shall follow you\r\nsoon. You like the fire, don\xe2\x80\x99t you, Johnny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy looked up doubtfully at her and murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I want\r\nit any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer grandfather had turned back again, and did not hear the boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreply. As soon as the white-haired man had vanished she said in a tone\r\nof pique to the child, \xe2\x80\x9cUngrateful little boy, how can you contradict\r\nme? Never shall you have a bonfire again unless you keep it up now.\r\nCome, tell me you like to do things for me, and don\xe2\x80\x99t deny it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe repressed child said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d and continued to stir the\r\nfire perfunctorily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay a little longer and I will give you a crooked six-pence,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEustacia, more gently. \xe2\x80\x9cPut in one piece of wood every two or three\r\nminutes, but not too much at once. I am going to walk along the ridge a\r\nlittle longer, but I shall keep on coming to you. And if you hear a\r\nfrog jump into the pond with a flounce like a stone thrown in, be sure\r\nyou run and tell me, because it is a sign of rain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Eustacia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vye, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vy\xe2\x80\x94stacia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do. Now put in one stick more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little slave went on feeding the fire as before. He seemed a mere\r\nautomaton, galvanized into moving and speaking by the wayward\r\nEustacia\xe2\x80\x99s will. He might have been the brass statue which Albertus\r\nMagnus is said to have animated just so far as to make it chatter, and\r\nmove, and be his servant.\r\n\r\nBefore going on her walk again the young girl stood still on the bank\r\nfor a few instants and listened. It was to the full as lonely a place\r\nas Rainbarrow, though at rather a lower level; and it was more\r\nsheltered from wind and weather on account of the few firs to the\r\nnorth. The bank which enclosed the homestead, and protected it from the\r\nlawless state of the world without, was formed of thick square clods,\r\ndug from the ditch on the outside, and built up with a slight batter or\r\nincline, which forms no slight defense where hedges will not grow\r\nbecause of the wind and the wilderness, and where wall materials are\r\nunattainable. Otherwise the situation was quite open, commanding the\r\nwhole length of the valley which reached to the river behind Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse. High above this to the right, and much nearer thitherward than\r\nthe Quiet Woman Inn, the blurred contour of Rainbarrow obstructed the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nAfter her attentive survey of the wild slopes and hollow ravines a\r\ngesture of impatience escaped Eustacia. She vented petulant words every\r\nnow and then, but there were sighs between her words, and sudden\r\nlistenings between her sighs. Descending from her perch she again\r\nsauntered off towards Rainbarrow, though this time she did not go the\r\nwhole way.\r\n\r\nTwice she reappeared at intervals of a few minutes and each time she\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot any flounce into the pond yet, little man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Miss Eustacia,\xe2\x80\x9d the child replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall soon be going in, and then I will\r\ngive you the crooked sixpence, and let you go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Miss Eustacia,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tired stoker, breathing more\r\neasily. And Eustacia again strolled away from the fire, but this time\r\nnot towards Rainbarrow. She skirted the bank and went round to the\r\nwicket before the house, where she stood motionless, looking at the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nFifty yards off rose the corner of the two converging banks, with the\r\nfire upon it; within the bank, lifting up to the fire one stick at a\r\ntime, just as before, the figure of the little child. She idly watched\r\nhim as he occasionally climbed up in the nook of the bank and stood\r\nbeside the brands. The wind blew the smoke, and the child\xe2\x80\x99s hair, and\r\nthe corner of his pinafore, all in the same direction; the breeze died,\r\nand the pinafore and hair lay still, and the smoke went up straight.\r\n\r\nWhile Eustacia looked on from this distance the boy\xe2\x80\x99s form visibly\r\nstarted\xe2\x80\x94he slid down the bank and ran across towards the white gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA hopfrog have jumped into the pond. Yes, I heard \xe2\x80\x99en!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it is going to rain, and you had better go home. You will not be\r\nafraid?\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke hurriedly, as if her heart had leapt into her throat\r\nat the boy\xe2\x80\x99s words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, because I shall hae the crooked sixpence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, here it is. Now run as fast as you can\xe2\x80\x94not that way\xe2\x80\x94through the\r\ngarden here. No other boy in the heath has had such a bonfire as\r\nyours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy, who clearly had had too much of a good thing, marched away\r\ninto the shadows with alacrity. When he was gone Eustacia, leaving her\r\ntelescope and hourglass by the gate, brushed forward from the wicket\r\ntowards the angle of the bank, under the fire.\r\n\r\nHere, screened by the outwork, she waited. In a few moments a splash\r\nwas audible from the pond outside. Had the child been there he would\r\nhave said that a second frog had jumped in; but by most people the\r\nsound would have been likened to the fall of a stone into the water.\r\nEustacia stepped upon the bank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and held her breath.\r\n\r\nThereupon the contour of a man became dimly visible against the\r\nlow-reaching sky over the valley, beyond the outer margin of the pool.\r\nHe came round it and leapt upon the bank beside her. A low laugh\r\nescaped her\xe2\x80\x94the third utterance which the girl had indulged in tonight.\r\nThe first, when she stood upon Rainbarrow, had expressed anxiety; the\r\nsecond, on the ridge, had expressed impatience; the present was one of\r\ntriumphant pleasure. She let her joyous eyes rest upon him without\r\nspeaking, as upon some wondrous thing she had created out of chaos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, who was Wildeve. \xe2\x80\x9cYou give me no peace.\r\nWhy do you not leave me alone? I have seen your bonfire all the\r\nevening.\xe2\x80\x9d The words were not without emotion, and retained their level\r\ntone as if by a careful equipoise between imminent extremes.\r\n\r\nAt this unexpectedly repressing manner in her lover the girl seemed to\r\nrepress herself also. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course you have seen my fire,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered\r\nwith languid calmness, artificially maintained. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I have a\r\nbonfire on the Fifth of November, like other denizens of the heath?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew it was meant for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you know it? I have had no word with you since you\xe2\x80\x94you chose\r\nher, and walked about with her, and deserted me entirely, as if I had\r\nnever been yours life and soul so irretrievably!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEustacia! could I forget that last autumn at this same day of the\r\nmonth and at this same place you lighted exactly such a fire as a\r\nsignal for me to come and see you? Why should there have been a bonfire\r\nagain by Captain Vye\xe2\x80\x99s house if not for the same purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes\xe2\x80\x94I own it,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried under her breath, with a drowsy fervour\r\nof manner and tone which was quite peculiar to her. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t begin\r\nspeaking to me as you did, Damon; you will drive me to say words I\r\nwould not wish to say to you. I had given you up, and resolved not to\r\nthink of you any more; and then I heard the news, and I came out and\r\ngot the fire ready because I thought that you had been faithful to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you heard to make you think that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve, astonished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you did not marry her!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured exultingly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I knew it\r\nwas because you loved me best, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it.... Damon, you have\r\nbeen cruel to me to go away, and I have said I would never forgive you.\r\nI do not think I can forgive you entirely, even now\xe2\x80\x94it is too much for\r\na woman of any spirit to quite overlook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had known you wished to call me up here only to reproach me, I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it, and I do forgive you now that you have not\r\nmarried her, and have come back to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you that I had not married her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy grandfather. He took a long walk today, and as he was coming home\r\nhe overtook some person who told him of a broken-off wedding\xe2\x80\x94he thought\r\nit might be yours, and I knew it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes anybody else know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose not. Now Damon, do you see why I lit my signal fire? You did\r\nnot think I would have lit it if I had imagined you to have become the\r\nhusband of this woman. It is insulting my pride to suppose that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWildeve was silent; it was evident that he had supposed as much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you indeed think I believed you were married?\xe2\x80\x9d she again demanded\r\nearnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you wronged me; and upon my life and heart I can\r\nhardly bear to recognize that you have such ill thoughts of me! Damon,\r\nyou are not worthy of me\xe2\x80\x94I see it, and yet I love you. Never mind, let\r\nit go\xe2\x80\x94I must bear your mean opinion as best I may.... It is true, is it\r\nnot,\xe2\x80\x9d she added with ill-concealed anxiety, on his making no\r\ndemonstration, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you could not bring yourself to give me up, and\r\nare still going to love me best of all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; or why should I have come?\xe2\x80\x9d he said touchily. \xe2\x80\x9cNot that fidelity\r\nwill be any great merit in me after your kind speech about my\r\nunworthiness, which should have been said by myself if by anybody, and\r\ncomes with an ill grace from you. However, the curse of inflammability\r\nis upon me, and I must live under it, and take any snub from a woman.\r\nIt has brought me down from engineering to innkeeping\xe2\x80\x94what lower stage\r\nit has in store for me I have yet to learn.\xe2\x80\x9d He continued to look upon\r\nher gloomily.\r\n\r\nShe seized the moment, and throwing back the shawl so that the\r\nfirelight shone full upon her face and throat, said with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cHave\r\nyou seen anything better than that in your travels?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEustacia was not one to commit herself to such a position without good\r\nground. He said quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot even on the shoulders of Thomasin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThomasin is a pleasing and innocent woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to do with it,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried with quick passionateness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will leave her out; there are only you and me now to think of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAfter a long look at him she resumed with the old quiescent warmth,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust I go on weakly confessing to you things a woman ought to conceal;\r\nand own that no words can express how gloomy I have been because of\r\nthat dreadful belief I held till two hours ago\xe2\x80\x94that you had quite\r\ndeserted me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry I caused you that pain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut perhaps it is not wholly because of you that I get gloomy,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\narchly added. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is in my nature to feel like that. It was born in my\r\nblood, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHypochondriasis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr else it was coming into this wild heath. I was happy enough at\r\nBudmouth. O the times, O the days at Budmouth! But Egdon will be\r\nbrighter again now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope it will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve moodily. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know the consequence of\r\nthis recall to me, my old darling? I shall come to see you again as\r\nbefore, at Rainbarrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet I declare that until I got here tonight I intended, after this\r\none good-bye, never to meet you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t thank you for that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, turning away, while indignation\r\nspread through her like subterranean heat. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may come again to\r\nRainbarrow if you like, but you won\xe2\x80\x99t see me; and you may call, but I\r\nshall not listen; and you may tempt me, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t give myself to you\r\nany more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have said as much before, sweet; but such natures as yours don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nso easily adhere to their words. Neither, for the matter of that, do\r\nsuch natures as mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the pleasure I have won by my trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered\r\nbitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did I try to recall you? Damon, a strange warring takes\r\nplace in my mind occasionally. I think when I become calm after you\r\nwoundings, \xe2\x80\x98Do I embrace a cloud of common fog after all?\xe2\x80\x99 You are a\r\nchameleon, and now you are at your worst colour. Go home, or I shall\r\nhate you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked absently towards Rainbarrow while one might have counted\r\ntwenty, and said, as if he did not much mind all this, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I will go\r\nhome. Do you mean to see me again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you own to me that the wedding is broken off because you love me\r\nbest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would be good policy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nwould get to know the extent of your power too clearly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is she now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I prefer not to speak of her to you. I have not yet\r\nmarried her; I have come in obedience to your call. That is enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI merely lit that fire because I was dull, and thought I would get a\r\nlittle excitement by calling you up and triumphing over you as the\r\nWitch of Endor called up Samuel. I determined you should come; and you\r\nhave come! I have shown my power. A mile and half hither, and a mile\r\nand half back again to your home\xe2\x80\x94three miles in the dark for me. Have I\r\nnot shown my power?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head at her. \xe2\x80\x9cI know you too well, my Eustacia; I know you\r\ntoo well. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a note in you which I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; and that hot\r\nlittle bosom couldn\xe2\x80\x99t play such a cold-blooded trick to save its life.\r\nI saw a woman on Rainbarrow at dusk looking down towards my house. I\r\nthink I drew out you before you drew out me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe revived embers of an old passion glowed clearly in Wildeve now; and\r\nhe leant forward as if about to put his face towards her cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, intractably moving to the other side of the decayed\r\nfire. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you mean by that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I may kiss your hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you may not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I may shake your hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I wish you good night without caring for either. Good-bye,\r\ngood-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe returned no answer, and with the bow of a dancing-master he\r\nvanished on the other side of the pool as he had come.\r\n\r\nEustacia sighed\xe2\x80\x94it was no fragile maiden sigh, but a sigh which shook\r\nher like a shiver. Whenever a flash of reason darted like an electric\r\nlight upon her lover\xe2\x80\x94as it sometimes would\xe2\x80\x94and showed his\r\nimperfections, she shivered thus. But it was over in a second, and she\r\nloved on. She knew that he trifled with her; but she loved on. She\r\nscattered the half-burnt brands, went indoors immediately, and up to\r\nher bedroom without a light. Amid the rustles which denoted her to be\r\nundressing in the darkness other heavy breaths frequently came; and the\r\nsame kind of shudder occasionally moved through her when, ten minutes\r\nlater, she lay on her bed asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\nQueen of Night\r\n\r\n\r\nEustacia Vye was the raw material of a divinity. On Olympus she would\r\nhave done well with a little preparation. She had the passions and\r\ninstincts which make a model goddess, that is, those which make not\r\nquite a model woman. Had it been possible for the earth and mankind to\r\nbe entirely in her grasp for a while, she had handled the distaff, the\r\nspindle, and the shears at her own free will, few in the world would\r\nhave noticed the change of government. There would have been the same\r\ninequality of lot, the same heaping up of favours here, of contumely\r\nthere, the same generosity before justice, the same perpetual dilemmas,\r\nthe same captious alteration of caresses and blows that we endure now.\r\n\r\nShe was in person full-limbed and somewhat heavy; without ruddiness, as\r\nwithout pallor; and soft to the touch as a cloud. To see her hair was\r\nto fancy that a whole winter did not contain darkness enough to form\r\nits shadow\xe2\x80\x94it closed over her forehead like nightfall extinguishing the\r\nwestern glow.\r\n\r\nHer nerves extended into those tresses, and her temper could always be\r\nsoftened by stroking them down. When her hair was brushed she would\r\ninstantly sink into stillness and look like the Sphinx. If, in passing\r\nunder one of the Egdon banks, any of its thick skeins were caught, as\r\nthey sometimes were, by a prickly tuft of the large _Ulex\r\nEurop\xc3\xa6us_\xe2\x80\x94which will act as a sort of hairbrush\xe2\x80\x94she would go back a few\r\nsteps, and pass against it a second time.\r\n\r\nShe had pagan eyes, full of nocturnal mysteries, and their light, as it\r\ncame and went, and came again, was partially hampered by their\r\noppressive lids and lashes; and of these the under lid was much fuller\r\nthan it usually is with English women. This enabled her to indulge in\r\nreverie without seeming to do so\xe2\x80\x94she might have been believed capable\r\nof sleeping without closing them up. Assuming that the souls of men and\r\nwomen were visible essences, you could fancy the colour of Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsoul to be flamelike. The sparks from it that rose into her dark pupils\r\ngave the same impression.\r\n\r\nThe mouth seemed formed less to speak than to quiver, less to quiver\r\nthan to kiss. Some might have added, less to kiss than to curl. Viewed\r\nsideways, the closing-line of her lips formed, with almost geometric\r\nprecision, the curve so well known in the arts of design as the\r\ncima-recta, or ogee. The sight of such a flexible bend as that on grim\r\nEgdon was quite an apparition. It was felt at once that the mouth did\r\nnot come over from Sleswig with a band of Saxon pirates whose lips met\r\nlike the two halves of a muffin. One had fancied that such lip-curves\r\nwere mostly lurking underground in the South as fragments of forgotten\r\nmarbles. So fine were the lines of her lips that, though full, each\r\ncorner of her mouth was as clearly cut as the point of a spear. This\r\nkeenness of corner was only blunted when she was given over to sudden\r\nfits of gloom, one of the phases of the night-side of sentiment which\r\nshe knew too well for her years.\r\n\r\nHer presence brought memories of such things as Bourbon roses, rubies,\r\nand tropical midnight; her moods recalled lotus-eaters and the march in\r\nAthalie; her motions, the ebb and flow of the sea; her voice, the\r\nviola. In a dim light, and with a slight rearrangement of her hair, her\r\ngeneral figure might have stood for that of either of the higher female\r\ndeities. The new moon behind her head, an old helmet upon it, a diadem\r\nof accidental dewdrops round her brow, would have been adjuncts\r\nsufficient to strike the note of Artemis, Athena, or Hera respectively,\r\nwith as close an approximation to the antique as that which passes\r\nmuster on many respected canvases.\r\n\r\nBut celestial imperiousness, love, wrath, and fervour had proved to be\r\nsomewhat thrown away on netherward Egdon. Her power was limited, and\r\nthe consciousness of this limitation had biassed her development. Egdon\r\nwas her Hades, and since coming there she had imbibed much of what was\r\ndark in its tone, though inwardly and eternally unreconciled thereto.\r\nHer appearance accorded well with this smouldering rebelliousness, and\r\nthe shady splendour of her beauty was the real surface of the sad and\r\nstifled warmth within her. A true Tartarean dignity sat upon her brow,\r\nand not factitiously or with marks of constraint, for it had grown in\r\nher with years.\r\n\r\nAcross the upper part of her head she wore a thin fillet of black\r\nvelvet, restraining the luxuriance of her shady hair, in a way which\r\nadded much to this class of majesty by irregularly clouding her\r\nforehead. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing can embellish a beautiful face more than a narrow\r\nband drawn over the brow,\xe2\x80\x9d says Richter. Some of the neighbouring girls\r\nwore coloured ribbon for the same purpose, and sported metallic\r\nornaments elsewhere; but if anyone suggested coloured ribbon and\r\nmetallic ornaments to Eustacia Vye she laughed and went on.\r\n\r\nWhy did a woman of this sort live on Egdon Heath? Budmouth was her\r\nnative place, a fashionable seaside resort at that date. She was the\r\ndaughter of the bandmaster of a regiment which had been quartered\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94a Corfiote by birth, and a fine musician\xe2\x80\x94who met his future wife\r\nduring her trip thither with her father the captain, a man of good\r\nfamily. The marriage was scarcely in accord with the old man\xe2\x80\x99s wishes,\r\nfor the bandmaster\xe2\x80\x99s pockets were as light as his occupation. But the\r\nmusician did his best; adopted his wife\xe2\x80\x99s name, made England\r\npermanently his home, took great trouble with his child\xe2\x80\x99s education,\r\nthe expenses of which were defrayed by the grandfather, and throve as\r\nthe chief local musician till her mother\xe2\x80\x99s death, when he left off\r\nthriving, drank, and died also. The girl was left to the care of her\r\ngrandfather, who, since three of his ribs became broken in a shipwreck,\r\nhad lived in this airy perch on Egdon, a spot which had taken his fancy\r\nbecause the house was to be had for next to nothing, and because a\r\nremote blue tinge on the horizon between the hills, visible from the\r\ncottage door, was traditionally believed to be the English Channel. She\r\nhated the change; she felt like one banished; but here she was forced\r\nto abide.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that in Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s brain were juxtaposed the strangest\r\nassortment of ideas, from old time and from new. There was no middle\r\ndistance in her perspective\xe2\x80\x94romantic recollections of sunny afternoons\r\non an esplanade, with military bands, officers, and gallants around,\r\nstood like gilded letters upon the dark tablet of surrounding Egdon.\r\nEvery bizarre effect that could result from the random intertwining of\r\nwatering-place glitter with the grand solemnity of a heath, was to be\r\nfound in her. Seeing nothing of human life now, she imagined all the\r\nmore of what she had seen.\r\n\r\nWhere did her dignity come from? By a latent vein from Alcinous\xe2\x80\x99 line,\r\nher father hailing from Ph\xc3\xa6acia\xe2\x80\x99s isle?\xe2\x80\x94or from Fitzalan and De Vere,\r\nher maternal grandfather having had a cousin in the peerage? Perhaps it\r\nwas the gift of Heaven\xe2\x80\x94a happy convergence of natural laws. Among other\r\nthings opportunity had of late years been denied her of learning to be\r\nundignified, for she lived lonely. Isolation on a heath renders\r\nvulgarity well-nigh impossible. It would have been as easy for the\r\nheath-ponies, bats, and snakes to be vulgar as for her. A narrow life\r\nin Budmouth might have completely demeaned her.\r\n\r\nThe only way to look queenly without realms or hearts to queen it over\r\nis to look as if you had lost them; and Eustacia did that to a triumph.\r\nIn the captain\xe2\x80\x99s cottage she could suggest mansions she had never seen.\r\nPerhaps that was because she frequented a vaster mansion than any of\r\nthem, the open hills. Like the summer condition of the place around\r\nher, she was an embodiment of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ca populous\r\nsolitude\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94apparently so listless, void, and quiet, she was really busy\r\nand full.\r\n\r\nTo be loved to madness\xe2\x80\x94such was her great desire. Love was to her the\r\none cordial which could drive away the eating loneliness of her days.\r\nAnd she seemed to long for the abstraction called passionate love more\r\nthan for any particular lover.\r\n\r\nShe could show a most reproachful look at times, but it was directed\r\nless against human beings than against certain creatures of her mind,\r\nthe chief of these being Destiny, through whose interference she dimly\r\nfancied it arose that love alighted only on gliding youth\xe2\x80\x94that any love\r\nshe might win would sink simultaneously with the sand in the glass. She\r\nthought of it with an ever-growing consciousness of cruelty, which\r\ntended to breed actions of reckless unconventionality, framed to snatch\r\na year\xe2\x80\x99s, a week\xe2\x80\x99s, even an hour\xe2\x80\x99s passion from anywhere while it could\r\nbe won. Through want of it she had sung without being merry, possessed\r\nwithout enjoying, outshone without triumphing. Her loneliness deepened\r\nher desire. On Egdon, coldest and meanest kisses were at famine prices,\r\nand where was a mouth matching hers to be found?\r\n\r\nFidelity in love for fidelity\xe2\x80\x99s sake had less attraction for her than\r\nfor most women; fidelity because of love\xe2\x80\x99s grip had much. A blaze of\r\nlove, and extinction, was better than a lantern glimmer of the same\r\nwhich should last long years. On this head she knew by prevision what\r\nmost women learn only by experience\xe2\x80\x94she had mentally walked round love,\r\ntold the towers thereof, considered its palaces, and concluded that\r\nlove was but a doleful joy. Yet she desired it, as one in a desert\r\nwould be thankful for brackish water.\r\n\r\nShe often repeated her prayers; not at particular times, but, like the\r\nunaffectedly devout, when she desired to pray. Her prayer was always\r\nspontaneous, and often ran thus, \xe2\x80\x9cO deliver my heart from this fearful\r\ngloom and loneliness; send me great love from somewhere, else I shall\r\ndie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer high gods were William the Conqueror, Strafford, and Napoleon\r\nBuonaparte, as they had appeared in the Lady\xe2\x80\x99s History used at the\r\nestablishment in which she was educated. Had she been a mother she\r\nwould have christened her boys such names as Saul or Sisera in\r\npreference to Jacob or David, neither of whom she admired. At school\r\nshe had used to side with the Philistines in several battles, and had\r\nwondered if Pontius Pilate were as handsome as he was frank and fair.\r\n\r\nThus she was a girl of some forwardness of mind, indeed, weighed in\r\nrelation to her situation among the very rearward of thinkers, very\r\noriginal. Her instincts towards social non-comformity were at the root\r\nof this. In the matter of holidays, her mood was that of horses who,\r\nwhen turned out to grass, enjoy looking upon their kind at work on the\r\nhighway. She only valued rest to herself when it came in the midst of\r\nother people\xe2\x80\x99s labour. Hence she hated Sundays when all was at rest,\r\nand often said they would be the death of her. To see the heathmen in\r\ntheir Sunday condition, that is, with their hands in their pockets,\r\ntheir boots newly oiled, and not laced up (a particularly Sunday sign),\r\nwalking leisurely among the turves and furze-faggots they had cut\r\nduring the week, and kicking them critically as if their use were\r\nunknown, was a fearful heaviness to her. To relieve the tedium of this\r\nuntimely day she would overhaul the cupboards containing her\r\ngrandfather\xe2\x80\x99s old charts and other rubbish, humming Saturday-night\r\nballads of the country people the while. But on Saturday nights she\r\nwould frequently sing a psalm, and it was always on a weekday that she\r\nread the Bible, that she might be unoppressed with a sense of doing her\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nSuch views of life were to some extent the natural begettings of her\r\nsituation upon her nature. To dwell on a heath without studying its\r\nmeanings was like wedding a foreigner without learning his tongue. The\r\nsubtle beauties of the heath were lost to Eustacia; she only caught its\r\nvapours. An environment which would have made a contented woman a poet,\r\na suffering woman a devotee, a pious woman a psalmist, even a giddy\r\nwoman thoughtful, made a rebellious woman saturnine.\r\n\r\nEustacia had got beyond the vision of some marriage of inexpressible\r\nglory; yet, though her emotions were in full vigour, she cared for no\r\nmeaner union. Thus we see her in a strange state of isolation. To have\r\nlost the godlike conceit that we may do what we will, and not to have\r\nacquired a homely zest for doing what we can, shows a grandeur of\r\ntemper which cannot be objected to in the abstract, for it denotes a\r\nmind that, though disappointed, forswears compromise. But, if congenial\r\nto philosophy, it is apt to be dangerous to the commonwealth. In a\r\nworld where doing means marrying, and the commonwealth is one of hearts\r\nand hands, the same peril attends the condition.\r\n\r\nAnd so we see our Eustacia\xe2\x80\x94for at times she was not altogether\r\nunlovable\xe2\x80\x94arriving at that stage of enlightenment which feels that\r\nnothing is worth while, and filling up the spare hours of her existence\r\nby idealizing Wildeve for want of a better object. This was the sole\r\nreason of his ascendency: she knew it herself. At moments her pride\r\nrebelled against her passion for him, and she even had longed to be\r\nfree. But there was only one circumstance which could dislodge him, and\r\nthat was the advent of a greater man.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, she suffered much from depression of spirits, and took\r\nslow walks to recover them, in which she carried her grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntelescope and her grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s hourglass\xe2\x80\x94the latter because of a\r\npeculiar pleasure she derived from watching a material representation\r\nof time\xe2\x80\x99s gradual glide away. She seldom schemed, but when she did\r\nscheme, her plans showed rather the comprehensive strategy of a general\r\nthan the small arts called womanish, though she could utter oracles of\r\nDelphian ambiguity when she did not choose to be direct. In heaven she\r\nwill probably sit between the H\xc3\xa9lo\xc3\xafses and the Cleopatras.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\nThose Who Are Found Where There Is Said to Be Nobody\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the sad little boy had withdrawn from the fire he clasped\r\nthe money tight in the palm of his hand, as if thereby to fortify his\r\ncourage, and began to run. There was really little danger in allowing a\r\nchild to go home alone on this part of Egdon Heath. The distance to the\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s house was not more than three-eighths of a mile, his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncottage, and one other a few yards further on, forming part of the\r\nsmall hamlet of Mistover Knap: the third and only remaining house was\r\nthat of Captain Vye and Eustacia, which stood quite away from the small\r\ncottages and was the loneliest of lonely houses on these thinly\r\npopulated slopes.\r\n\r\nHe ran until he was out of breath, and then, becoming more courageous,\r\nwalked leisurely along, singing in an old voice a little song about a\r\nsailor-boy and a fair one, and bright gold in store. In the middle of\r\nthis the child stopped\xe2\x80\x94from a pit under the hill ahead of him shone a\r\nlight, whence proceeded a cloud of floating dust and a smacking noise.\r\n\r\nOnly unusual sights and sounds frightened the boy. The shrivelled voice\r\nof the heath did not alarm him, for that was familiar. The thornbushes\r\nwhich arose in his path from time to time were less satisfactory, for\r\nthey whistled gloomily, and had a ghastly habit after dark of putting\r\non the shapes of jumping madmen, sprawling giants, and hideous\r\ncripples. Lights were not uncommon this evening, but the nature of all\r\nof them was different from this. Discretion rather than terror prompted\r\nthe boy to turn back instead of passing the light, with a view of\r\nasking Miss Eustacia Vye to let her servant accompany him home.\r\n\r\nWhen the boy had reascended to the top of the valley he found the fire\r\nto be still burning on the bank, though lower than before. Beside it,\r\ninstead of Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s solitary form, he saw two persons, the second\r\nbeing a man. The boy crept along under the bank to ascertain from the\r\nnature of the proceedings if it would be prudent to interrupt so\r\nsplendid a creature as Miss Eustacia on his poor trivial account.\r\n\r\nAfter listening under the bank for some minutes to the talk he turned\r\nin a perplexed and doubting manner and began to withdraw as silently as\r\nhe had come. That he did not, upon the whole, think it advisable to\r\ninterrupt her conversation with Wildeve, without being prepared to bear\r\nthe whole weight of her displeasure, was obvious.\r\n\r\nHere was a Scyll\xc3\xa6o-Charybdean position for a poor boy. Pausing when\r\nagain safe from discovery, he finally decided to face the pit\r\nphenomenon as the lesser evil. With a heavy sigh he retraced the slope,\r\nand followed the path he had followed before.\r\n\r\nThe light had gone, the rising dust had disappeared\xe2\x80\x94he hoped for ever.\r\nHe marched resolutely along, and found nothing to alarm him till,\r\ncoming within a few yards of the sandpit, he heard a slight noise in\r\nfront, which led him to halt. The halt was but momentary, for the noise\r\nresolved itself into the steady bites of two animals grazing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo he\xe2\x80\x99th-croppers down here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cI have never known \xe2\x80\x99em\r\ncome down so far afore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe animals were in the direct line of his path, but that the child\r\nthought little of; he had played round the fetlocks of horses from his\r\ninfancy. On coming nearer, however, the boy was somewhat surprised to\r\nfind that the little creatures did not run off, and that each wore a\r\nclog, to prevent his going astray; this signified that they had been\r\nbroken in. He could now see the interior of the pit, which, being in\r\nthe side of the hill, had a level entrance. In the innermost corner the\r\nsquare outline of a van appeared, with its back towards him. A light\r\ncame from the interior, and threw a moving shadow upon the vertical\r\nface of gravel at the further side of the pit into which the vehicle\r\nfaced.\r\n\r\nThe child assumed that this was the cart of a gipsy, and his dread of\r\nthose wanderers reached but to that mild pitch which titillates rather\r\nthan pains. Only a few inches of mud wall kept him and his family from\r\nbeing gipsies themselves. He skirted the gravel pit at a respectful\r\ndistance, ascended the slope, and came forward upon the brow, in order\r\nto look into the open door of the van and see the original of the\r\nshadow.\r\n\r\nThe picture alarmed the boy. By a little stove inside the van sat a\r\nfigure red from head to heels\xe2\x80\x94the man who had been Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s friend.\r\nHe was darning a stocking, which was red like the rest of him.\r\nMoreover, as he darned he smoked a pipe, the stem and bowl of which\r\nwere red also.\r\n\r\nAt this moment one of the heath-croppers feeding in the outer shadows\r\nwas audibly shaking off the clog attached to its foot. Aroused by the\r\nsound, the reddleman laid down his stocking, lit a lantern which hung\r\nbeside him, and came out from the van. In sticking up the candle he\r\nlifted the lantern to his face, and the light shone into the whites of\r\nhis eyes and upon his ivory teeth, which, in contrast with the red\r\nsurrounding, lent him a startling aspect enough to the gaze of a\r\njuvenile. The boy knew too well for his peace of mind upon whose lair\r\nhe had lighted. Uglier persons than gipsies were known to cross Egdon\r\nat times, and a reddleman was one of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow I wish \xe2\x80\x99twas only a gipsy!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\nThe man was by this time coming back from the horses. In his fear of\r\nbeing seen the boy rendered detection certain by nervous motion. The\r\nheather and peat stratum overhung the brow of the pit in mats, hiding\r\nthe actual verge. The boy had stepped beyond the solid ground; the\r\nheather now gave way, and down he rolled over the scarp of grey sand to\r\nthe very foot of the man.\r\n\r\nThe red man opened the lantern and turned it upon the figure of the\r\nprostrate boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho be ye?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohnny Nunsuch, master!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were you doing up there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWatching me, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you watch me for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I was coming home from Miss Vye\xe2\x80\x99s bonfire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeest hurt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, you be\xe2\x80\x94your hand is bleeding. Come under my tilt and let me\r\ntie it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease let me look for my sixpence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you come by that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vye gied it to me for keeping up her bonfire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sixpence was found, and the man went to the van, the boy behind,\r\nalmost holding his breath.\r\n\r\nThe man took a piece of rag from a satchel containing sewing materials,\r\ntore off a strip, which, like everything else, was tinged red, and\r\nproceeded to bind up the wound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy eyes have got foggy-like\xe2\x80\x94please may I sit down, master?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nboy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, poor chap. \xe2\x80\x99Tis enough to make you feel fainty. Sit on\r\nthat bundle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man finished tying up the gash, and the boy said, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ll go\r\nhome now, master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are rather afraid of me. Do you know what I be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child surveyed his vermilion figure up and down with much misgiving\r\nand finally said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe reddleman!\xe2\x80\x9d he faltered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I be. Though there\xe2\x80\x99s more than one. You little\r\nchildren think there\xe2\x80\x99s only one cuckoo, one fox, one giant, one devil,\r\nand one reddleman, when there\xe2\x80\x99s lots of us all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there? You won\xe2\x80\x99t carry me off in your bags, will ye, master? \xe2\x80\x99Tis\r\nsaid that the reddleman will sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense. All that reddlemen do is sell reddle. You see all these bags\r\nat the back of my cart? They are not full of little boys\xe2\x80\x94only full of\r\nred stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas you born a reddleman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I took to it. I should be as white as you if I were to give up the\r\ntrade\xe2\x80\x94that is, I should be white in time\xe2\x80\x94perhaps six months; not at\r\nfirst, because \xe2\x80\x99tis grow\xe2\x80\x99d into my skin and won\xe2\x80\x99t wash out. Now, you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nnever be afraid of a reddleman again, will ye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, never. Willy Orchard said he seed a red ghost here t\xe2\x80\x99other\r\nday\xe2\x80\x94perhaps that was you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was here t\xe2\x80\x99other day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you making that dusty light I saw by now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I was beating out some bags. And have you had a good bonfire\r\nup there? I saw the light. Why did Miss Vye want a bonfire so bad that\r\nshe should give you sixpence to keep it up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I was tired, but she made me bide and keep up the fire\r\njust the same, while she kept going up across Rainbarrow way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how long did that last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUntil a hopfrog jumped into the pond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reddleman suddenly ceased to talk idly. \xe2\x80\x9cA hopfrog?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHopfrogs don\xe2\x80\x99t jump into ponds this time of year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey do, for I heard one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertain-sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. She told me afore that I should hear\xe2\x80\x99n; and so I did. They say\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s clever and deep, and perhaps she charmed \xe2\x80\x99en to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I came down here, and I was afeard, and I went back; but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike to speak to her, because of the gentleman, and I came on here\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA gentleman\xe2\x80\x94ah! What did she say to him, my man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTold him she supposed he had not married the other woman because he\r\nliked his old sweetheart best; and things like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did the gentleman say to her, my sonny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe only said he did like her best, and how he was coming to see her\r\nagain under Rainbarrow o\xe2\x80\x99 nights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the reddleman, slapping his hand against the side of his\r\nvan so that the whole fabric shook under the blow. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the secret\r\no\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little boy jumped clean from the stool.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy man, don\xe2\x80\x99t you be afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said the dealer in red, suddenly\r\nbecoming gentle. \xe2\x80\x9cI forgot you were here. That\xe2\x80\x99s only a curious way\r\nreddlemen have of going mad for a moment; but they don\xe2\x80\x99t hurt anybody.\r\nAnd what did the lady say then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t mind. Please, Master Reddleman, may I go home-along now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, to be sure you may. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go a bit of ways with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe conducted the boy out of the gravel pit and into the path leading to\r\nhis mother\xe2\x80\x99s cottage. When the little figure had vanished in the\r\ndarkness the reddleman returned, resumed his seat by the fire, and\r\nproceeded to darn again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\nLove Leads a Shrewd Man into Strategy\r\n\r\n\r\nReddlemen of the old school are now but seldom seen. Since the\r\nintroduction of railways Wessex farmers have managed to do without\r\nthese Mephistophelian visitants, and the bright pigment so largely used\r\nby shepherds in preparing sheep for the fair is obtained by other\r\nroutes. Even those who yet survive are losing the poetry of existence\r\nwhich characterized them when the pursuit of the trade meant periodical\r\njourneys to the pit whence the material was dug, a regular camping out\r\nfrom month to month, except in the depth of winter, a peregrination\r\namong farms which could be counted by the hundred, and in spite of this\r\nArab existence the preservation of that respectability which is insured\r\nby the never-failing production of a well-lined purse.\r\n\r\nReddle spreads its lively hues over everything it lights on, and stamps\r\nunmistakably, as with the mark of Cain, any person who has handled it\r\nhalf an hour.\r\n\r\nA child\xe2\x80\x99s first sight of a reddleman was an epoch in his life. That\r\nblood-coloured figure was a sublimation of all the horrid dreams which\r\nhad afflicted the juvenile spirit since imagination began. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nreddleman is coming for you!\xe2\x80\x9d had been the formulated threat of Wessex\r\nmothers for many generations. He was successfully supplanted for a\r\nwhile, at the beginning of the present century, by Buonaparte; but as\r\nprocess of time rendered the latter personage stale and ineffective the\r\nolder phrase resumed its early prominence. And now the reddleman has in\r\nhis turn followed Buonaparte to the land of worn-out bogeys, and his\r\nplace is filled by modern inventions.\r\n\r\nThe reddleman lived like a gipsy; but gipsies he scorned. He was about\r\nas thriving as travelling basket and mat makers; but he had nothing to\r\ndo with them. He was more decently born and brought up than the\r\ncattledrovers who passed and repassed him in his wanderings; but they\r\nmerely nodded to him. His stock was more valuable than that of pedlars;\r\nbut they did not think so, and passed his cart with eyes straight\r\nahead. He was such an unnatural colour to look at that the men of\r\nroundabouts and waxwork shows seemed gentlemen beside him; but he\r\nconsidered them low company, and remained aloof. Among all these\r\nsquatters and folks of the road the reddleman continually found\r\nhimself; yet he was not of them. His occupation tended to isolate him,\r\nand isolated he was mostly seen to be.\r\n\r\nIt was sometimes suggested that reddlemen were criminals for whose\r\nmisdeeds other men wrongfully suffered\xe2\x80\x94that in escaping the law they\r\nhad not escaped their own consciences, and had taken to the trade as a\r\nlifelong penance. Else why should they have chosen it? In the present\r\ncase such a question would have been particularly apposite. The\r\nreddleman who had entered Egdon that afternoon was an instance of the\r\npleasing being wasted to form the ground-work of the singular, when an\r\nugly foundation would have done just as well for that purpose. The one\r\npoint that was forbidding about this reddleman was his colour. Freed\r\nfrom that he would have been as agreeable a specimen of rustic manhood\r\nas one would often see. A keen observer might have been inclined to\r\nthink\xe2\x80\x94which was, indeed, partly the truth\xe2\x80\x94that he had relinquished his\r\nproper station in life for want of interest in it. Moreover, after\r\nlooking at him one would have hazarded the guess that good nature, and\r\nan acuteness as extreme as it could be without verging on craft, formed\r\nthe framework of his character.\r\n\r\nWhile he darned the stocking his face became rigid with thought. Softer\r\nexpressions followed this, and then again recurred the tender sadness\r\nwhich had sat upon him during his drive along the highway that\r\nafternoon. Presently his needle stopped. He laid down the stocking,\r\narose from his seat, and took a leathern pouch from a hook in the\r\ncorner of the van. This contained among other articles a brown-paper\r\npacket, which, to judge from the hinge-like character of its worn\r\nfolds, seemed to have been carefully opened and closed a good many\r\ntimes. He sat down on a three-legged milking stool that formed the only\r\nseat in the van, and, examining his packet by the light of a candle,\r\ntook thence an old letter and spread it open. The writing had\r\noriginally been traced on white paper, but the letter had now assumed a\r\npale red tinge from the accident of its situation; and the black\r\nstrokes of writing thereon looked like the twigs of a winter hedge\r\nagainst a vermilion sunset. The letter bore a date some two years\r\nprevious to that time, and was signed \xe2\x80\x9cThomasin Yeobright.\xe2\x80\x9d It ran as\r\nfollows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nDEAR DIGGORY VENN,\xe2\x80\x94The question you put when you overtook me coming\r\nhome from Pond-close gave me such a surprise that I am afraid I did not\r\nmake you exactly understand what I meant. Of course, if my aunt had not\r\nmet me I could have explained all then at once, but as it was there was\r\nno chance. I have been quite uneasy since, as you know I do not wish to\r\npain you, yet I fear I shall be doing so now in contradicting what I\r\nseemed to say then. I cannot, Diggory, marry you, or think of letting\r\nyou call me your sweetheart. I could not, indeed, Diggory. I hope you\r\nwill not much mind my saying this, and feel in a great pain. It makes\r\nme very sad when I think it may, for I like you very much, and I always\r\nput you next to my cousin Clym in my mind. There are so many reasons\r\nwhy we cannot be married that I can hardly name them all in a letter. I\r\ndid not in the least expect that you were going to speak on such a\r\nthing when you followed me, because I had never thought of you in the\r\nsense of a lover at all. You must not becall me for laughing when you\r\nspoke; you mistook when you thought I laughed at you as a foolish man.\r\nI laughed because the idea was so odd, and not at you at all. The great\r\nreason with my own personal self for not letting you court me is, that\r\nI do not feel the things a woman ought to feel who consents to walk\r\nwith you with the meaning of being your wife. It is not as you think,\r\nthat I have another in my mind, for I do not encourage anybody, and\r\nnever have in my life. Another reason is my aunt. She would not, I\r\nknow, agree to it, even if I wished to have you. She likes you very\r\nwell, but she will want me to look a little higher than a small\r\ndairy-farmer, and marry a professional man. I hope you will not set\r\nyour heart against me for writing plainly, but I felt you might try to\r\nsee me again, and it is better that we should not meet. I shall always\r\nthink of you as a good man, and be anxious for your well-doing. I send\r\nthis by Jane Orchard\xe2\x80\x99s little maid,\xe2\x80\x94And remain Diggory, your faithful\r\nfriend,\r\n\r\nTHOMASIN YEOBRIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mr. VENN, Dairy-farmer.\r\n\r\nSince the arrival of that letter, on a certain autumn morning long ago,\r\nthe reddleman and Thomasin had not met till today. During the interval\r\nhe had shifted his position even further from hers than it had\r\noriginally been, by adopting the reddle trade; though he was really in\r\nvery good circumstances still. Indeed, seeing that his expenditure was\r\nonly one-fourth of his income, he might have been called a prosperous\r\nman.\r\n\r\nRejected suitors take to roaming as naturally as unhived bees; and the\r\nbusiness to which he had cynically devoted himself was in many ways\r\ncongenial to Venn. But his wanderings, by mere stress of old emotions,\r\nhad frequently taken an Egdon direction, though he never intruded upon\r\nher who attracted him thither. To be in Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s heath, and near her,\r\nyet unseen, was the one ewe-lamb of pleasure left to him.\r\n\r\nThen came the incident of that day, and the reddleman, still loving her\r\nwell, was excited by this accidental service to her at a critical\r\njuncture to vow an active devotion to her cause, instead of, as\r\nhitherto, sighing and holding aloof. After what had happened it was\r\nimpossible that he should not doubt the honesty of Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nintentions. But her hope was apparently centred upon him; and\r\ndismissing his regrets Venn determined to aid her to be happy in her\r\nown chosen way. That this way was, of all others, the most distressing\r\nto himself, was awkward enough; but the reddleman\xe2\x80\x99s love was generous.\r\n\r\nHis first active step in watching over Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s interests was taken\r\nabout seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock the next evening and was dictated by the news which\r\nhe had learnt from the sad boy. That Eustacia was somehow the cause of\r\nWildeve\xe2\x80\x99s carelessness in relation to the marriage had at once been\r\nVenn\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion on hearing of the secret meeting between them. It did\r\nnot occur to his mind that Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s love signal to Wildeve was the\r\ntender effect upon the deserted beauty of the intelligence which her\r\ngrandfather had brought home. His instinct was to regard her as a\r\nconspirator against rather than as an antecedent obstacle to Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nDuring the day he had been exceedingly anxious to learn the condition\r\nof Thomasin, but he did not venture to intrude upon a threshold to\r\nwhich he was a stranger, particularly at such an unpleasant moment as\r\nthis. He had occupied his time in moving with his ponies and load to a\r\nnew point in the heath, eastward to his previous station; and here he\r\nselected a nook with a careful eye to shelter from wind and rain, which\r\nseemed to mean that his stay there was to be a comparatively extended\r\none. After this he returned on foot some part of the way that he had\r\ncome; and, it being now dark, he diverged to the left till he stood\r\nbehind a holly bush on the edge of a pit not twenty yards from\r\nRainbarrow.\r\n\r\nHe watched for a meeting there, but he watched in vain. Nobody except\r\nhimself came near the spot that night.\r\n\r\nBut the loss of his labour produced little effect upon the reddleman.\r\nHe had stood in the shoes of Tantalus, and seemed to look upon a\r\ncertain mass of disappointment as the natural preface to all\r\nrealizations, without which preface they would give cause for alarm.\r\n\r\nThe same hour the next evening found him again at the same place; but\r\nEustacia and Wildeve, the expected trysters, did not appear.\r\n\r\nHe pursued precisely the same course yet four nights longer, and\r\nwithout success. But on the next, being the day-week of their previous\r\nmeeting, he saw a female shape floating along the ridge and the outline\r\nof a young man ascending from the valley. They met in the little ditch\r\nencircling the barrow\xe2\x80\x94the original excavation from which it had been\r\nthrown up by the ancient British people.\r\n\r\nThe reddleman, stung with suspicion of wrong to Thomasin, was aroused\r\nto strategy in a moment. He instantly left the bush and crept forward\r\non his hands and knees. When he had got as close as he might safely\r\nventure without discovery he found that, owing to a cross-wind, the\r\nconversation of the trysting pair could not be overheard.\r\n\r\nNear him, as in divers places about the heath, were areas strewn with\r\nlarge turves, which lay edgeways and upside down awaiting removal by\r\nTimothy Fairway, previous to the winter weather. He took two of these\r\nas he lay, and dragged them over him till one covered his head and\r\nshoulders, the other his back and legs. The reddleman would now have\r\nbeen quite invisible, even by daylight; the turves, standing upon him\r\nwith the heather upwards, looked precisely as if they were growing. He\r\ncrept along again, and the turves upon his back crept with him. Had he\r\napproached without any covering the chances are that he would not have\r\nbeen perceived in the dusk; approaching thus, it was as though he\r\nburrowed underground. In this manner he came quite close to where the\r\ntwo were standing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWish to consult me on the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d reached his ears in the rich,\r\nimpetuous accents of Eustacia Vye. \xe2\x80\x9cConsult me? It is an indignity to\r\nme to talk so\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t bear it any longer!\xe2\x80\x9d She began weeping. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nloved you, and have shown you that I loved you, much to my regret; and\r\nyet you can come and say in that frigid way that you wish to consult\r\nwith me whether it would not be better to marry Thomasin. Better\xe2\x80\x94of\r\ncourse it would be. Marry her\xe2\x80\x94she is nearer to your own position in\r\nlife than I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; that\xe2\x80\x99s very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve peremptorily. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we must\r\nlook at things as they are. Whatever blame may attach to me for having\r\nbrought it about, Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s position is at present much worse than\r\nyours. I simply tell you that I am in a strait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you shall not tell me! You must see that it is only harassing me.\r\nDamon, you have not acted well; you have sunk in my opinion. You have\r\nnot valued my courtesy\xe2\x80\x94the courtesy of a lady in loving you\xe2\x80\x94who used to\r\nthink of far more ambitious things. But it was Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s fault. She\r\nwon you away from me, and she deserves to suffer for it. Where is she\r\nstaying now? Not that I care, nor where I am myself. Ah, if I were dead\r\nand gone how glad she would be! Where is she, I ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThomasin is now staying at her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s shut up in a bedroom, and\r\nkeeping out of everybody\xe2\x80\x99s sight,\xe2\x80\x9d he said indifferently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you care much about her even now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia with\r\nsudden joyousness, \xe2\x80\x9cfor if you did you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk so coolly about\r\nher. Do you talk so coolly to her about me? Ah, I expect you do! Why\r\ndid you originally go away from me? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can ever forgive\r\nyou, except on one condition, that whenever you desert me, you come\r\nback again, sorry that you served me so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never wish to desert you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not thank you for that. I should hate it to be all smooth.\r\nIndeed, I think I like you to desert me a little once now and then.\r\nLove is the dismallest thing where the lover is quite honest. O, it is\r\na shame to say so; but it is true!\xe2\x80\x9d She indulged in a little laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nlow spirits begin at the very idea. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you offer me tame love, or\r\naway you go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish Tamsie were not such a confoundedly good little woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nWildeve, \xe2\x80\x9cso that I could be faithful to you without injuring a worthy\r\nperson. It is I who am the sinner after all; I am not worth the little\r\nfinger of either of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must not sacrifice yourself to her from any sense of justice,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied Eustacia quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you do not love her it is the most\r\nmerciful thing in the long run to leave her as she is. That\xe2\x80\x99s always\r\nthe best way. There, now I have been unwomanly, I suppose. When you\r\nhave left me I am always angry with myself for things that I have said\r\nto you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWildeve walked a pace or two among the heather without replying. The\r\npause was filled up by the intonation of a pollard thorn a little way\r\nto windward, the breezes filtering through its unyielding twigs as\r\nthrough a strainer. It was as if the night sang dirges with clenched\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nShe continued, half sorrowfully, \xe2\x80\x9cSince meeting you last, it has\r\noccurred to me once or twice that perhaps it was not for love of me you\r\ndid not marry her. Tell me, Damon\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to bear it. Had I nothing\r\nwhatever to do with the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you press me to tell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I must know. I see I have been too ready to believe in my own\r\npower.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the immediate reason was that the license would not do for the\r\nplace, and before I could get another she ran away. Up to that point\r\nyou had nothing to do with it. Since then her aunt has spoken to me in\r\na tone which I don\xe2\x80\x99t at all like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes! I am nothing in it\xe2\x80\x94I am nothing in it. You only trifle with\r\nme. Heaven, what can I, Eustacia Vye, be made of to think so much of\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense; do not be so passionate.... Eustacia, how we roved among\r\nthese bushes last year, when the hot days had got cool, and the shades\r\nof the hills kept us almost invisible in the hollows!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe remained in moody silence till she said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes; and how I used to\r\nlaugh at you for daring to look up to me! But you have well made me\r\nsuffer for that since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you served me cruelly enough until I thought I had found someone\r\nfairer than you. A blessed find for me, Eustacia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you still think you found somebody fairer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes I do, sometimes I don\xe2\x80\x99t. The scales are balanced so nicely\r\nthat a feather would turn them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you really care whether I meet you or whether I don\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI care a little, but not enough to break my rest,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young\r\nman languidly. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, all that\xe2\x80\x99s past. I find there are two flowers where\r\nI thought there was only one. Perhaps there are three, or four, or any\r\nnumber as good as the first.... Mine is a curious fate. Who would have\r\nthought that all this could happen to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe interrupted with a suppressed fire of which either love or anger\r\nseemed an equally possible issue, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you love me now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho can say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me; I will know it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do, and I do not,\xe2\x80\x9d said he mischievously. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is, I have my times\r\nand my seasons. One moment you are too tall, another moment you are too\r\ndo-nothing, another too melancholy, another too dark, another I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what, except\xe2\x80\x94that you are not the whole world to me that you used\r\nto be, my dear. But you are a pleasant lady to know and nice to meet,\r\nand I dare say as sweet as ever\xe2\x80\x94almost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEustacia was silent, and she turned from him, till she said, in a voice\r\nof suspended mightiness, \xe2\x80\x9cI am for a walk, and this is my way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can do worse than follow you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know you can\xe2\x80\x99t do otherwise, for all your moods and changes!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nanswered defiantly. \xe2\x80\x9cSay what you will; try as you may; keep away from\r\nme all that you can\xe2\x80\x94you will never forget me. You will love me all your\r\nlife long. You would jump to marry me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I would!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch strange thoughts as I\xe2\x80\x99ve had from\r\ntime to time, Eustacia; and they come to me this moment. You hate the\r\nheath as much as ever; that I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured deeply. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis my cross, my shame, and will be my\r\ndeath!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI abhor it too,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cHow mournfully the wind blows round us\r\nnow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not answer. Its tone was indeed solemn and pervasive. Compound\r\nutterances addressed themselves to their senses, and it was possible to\r\nview by ear the features of the neighbourhood. Acoustic pictures were\r\nreturned from the darkened scenery; they could hear where the tracts of\r\nheather began and ended; where the furze was growing stalky and tall;\r\nwhere it had been recently cut; in what direction the fir-clump lay,\r\nand how near was the pit in which the hollies grew; for these differing\r\nfeatures had their voices no less than their shapes and colours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod, how lonely it is!\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Wildeve. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are picturesque ravines\r\nand mists to us who see nothing else? Why should we stay here? Will you\r\ngo with me to America? I have kindred in Wisconsin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat wants consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems impossible to do well here, unless one were a wild bird or a\r\nlandscape-painter. Well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me time,\xe2\x80\x9d she softly said, taking his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica is so far\r\naway. Are you going to walk with me a little way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Eustacia uttered the latter words she retired from the base of the\r\nbarrow, and Wildeve followed her, so that the reddleman could hear no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nHe lifted the turves and arose. Their black figures sank and\r\ndisappeared from against the sky. They were as two horns which the\r\nsluggish heath had put forth from its crown, like a mollusc, and had\r\nnow again drawn in.\r\n\r\nThe reddleman\xe2\x80\x99s walk across the vale, and over into the next where his\r\ncart lay, was not sprightly for a slim young fellow of twenty-four. His\r\nspirit was perturbed to aching. The breezes that blew around his mouth\r\nin that walk carried off upon them the accents of a commination.\r\n\r\nHe entered the van, where there was a fire in a stove. Without lighting\r\nhis candle he sat down at once on the three-legged stool, and pondered\r\non what he had seen and heard touching that still-loved one of his. He\r\nuttered a sound which was neither sigh nor sob, but was even more\r\nindicative than either of a troubled mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Tamsie,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered heavily. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can be done? Yes, I will see\r\nthat Eustacia Vye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\nA Desperate Attempt at Persuasion\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, at the time when the height of the sun appeared very\r\ninsignificant from any part of the heath as compared with the altitude\r\nof Rainbarrow, and when all the little hills in the lower levels were\r\nlike an archipelago in a fog-formed \xc3\x86gean, the reddleman came from the\r\nbrambled nook which he had adopted as his quarters and ascended the\r\nslopes of Mistover Knap.\r\n\r\nThough these shaggy hills were apparently so solitary, several keen\r\nround eyes were always ready on such a wintry morning as this to\r\nconverge upon a passer-by. Feathered species sojourned here in hiding\r\nwhich would have created wonder if found elsewhere. A bustard haunted\r\nthe spot, and not many years before this five and twenty might have\r\nbeen seen in Egdon at one time. Marsh-harriers looked up from the\r\nvalley by Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s. A cream-coloured courser had used to visit this\r\nhill, a bird so rare that not more than a dozen have ever been seen in\r\nEngland; but a barbarian rested neither night nor day till he had shot\r\nthe African truant, and after that event cream-coloured coursers\r\nthought fit to enter Egdon no more.\r\n\r\nA traveller who should walk and observe any of these visitants as Venn\r\nobserved them now could feel himself to be in direct communication with\r\nregions unknown to man. Here in front of him was a wild mallard\xe2\x80\x94just\r\narrived from the home of the north wind. The creature brought within\r\nhim an amplitude of Northern knowledge. Glacial catastrophes, snowstorm\r\nepisodes, glittering auroral effects, Polaris in the zenith, Franklin\r\nunderfoot\xe2\x80\x94the category of his commonplaces was wonderful. But the bird,\r\nlike many other philosophers, seemed as he looked at the reddleman to\r\nthink that a present moment of comfortable reality was worth a decade\r\nof memories.\r\n\r\nVenn passed on through these towards the house of the isolated beauty\r\nwho lived up among them and despised them. The day was Sunday; but as\r\ngoing to church, except to be married or buried, was exceptional at\r\nEgdon, this made little difference. He had determined upon the bold\r\nstroke of asking for an interview with Miss Vye\xe2\x80\x94to attack her position\r\nas Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s rival either by art or by storm, showing therein,\r\nsomewhat too conspicuously, the want of gallantry characteristic of a\r\ncertain astute sort of men, from clowns to kings. The great Frederick\r\nmaking war on the beautiful Archduchess, Napoleon refusing terms to the\r\nbeautiful Queen of Prussia, were not more dead to difference of sex\r\nthan the reddleman was, in his peculiar way, in planning the\r\ndisplacement of Eustacia.\r\n\r\nTo call at the captain\xe2\x80\x99s cottage was always more or less an undertaking\r\nfor the inferior inhabitants. Though occasionally chatty, his moods\r\nwere erratic, and nobody could be certain how he would behave at any\r\nparticular moment. Eustacia was reserved, and lived very much to\r\nherself. Except the daughter of one of the cotters, who was their\r\nservant, and a lad who worked in the garden and stable, scarcely anyone\r\nbut themselves ever entered the house. They were the only genteel\r\npeople of the district except the Yeobrights, and though far from rich,\r\nthey did not feel that necessity for preserving a friendly face towards\r\nevery man, bird, and beast which influenced their poorer neighbours.\r\n\r\nWhen the reddleman entered the garden the old man was looking through\r\nhis glass at the stain of blue sea in the distant landscape, the little\r\nanchors on his buttons twinkling in the sun. He recognized Venn as his\r\ncompanion on the highway, but made no remark on that circumstance,\r\nmerely saying, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, reddleman\xe2\x80\x94you here? Have a glass of grog?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVenn declined, on the plea of it being too early, and stated that his\r\nbusiness was with Miss Vye. The captain surveyed him from cap to\r\nwaistcoat and from waistcoat to leggings for a few moments, and finally\r\nasked him to go indoors.\r\n\r\nMiss Vye was not to be seen by anybody just then; and the reddleman\r\nwaited in the window-bench of the kitchen, his hands hanging across his\r\ndivergent knees, and his cap hanging from his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose the young lady is not up yet?\xe2\x80\x9d he presently said to the\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot quite yet. Folks never call upon ladies at this time of day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll step outside,\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she is willing to see me, will\r\nshe please send out word, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reddleman left the house and loitered on the hill adjoining. A\r\nconsiderable time elapsed, and no request for his presence was brought.\r\nHe was beginning to think that his scheme had failed, when he beheld\r\nthe form of Eustacia herself coming leisurely towards him. A sense of\r\nnovelty in giving audience to that singular figure had been sufficient\r\nto draw her forth.\r\n\r\nShe seemed to feel, after a bare look at Diggory Venn, that the man had\r\ncome on a strange errand, and that he was not so mean as she had\r\nthought him; for her close approach did not cause him to writhe\r\nuneasily, or shift his feet, or show any of those little signs which\r\nescape an ingenuous rustic at the advent of the uncommon in womankind.\r\nOn his inquiring if he might have a conversation with her she replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, walk beside me,\xe2\x80\x9d and continued to move on.\r\n\r\nBefore they had gone far it occurred to the perspicacious reddleman\r\nthat he would have acted more wisely by appearing less\r\nunimpressionable, and he resolved to correct the error as soon as he\r\ncould find opportunity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have made so bold, miss, as to step across and tell you some strange\r\nnews which has come to my ears about that man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! what man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe jerked his elbow to the southeast\xe2\x80\x94the direction of the Quiet Woman.\r\n\r\nEustacia turned quickly to him. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean Mr. Wildeve?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there is trouble in a household on account of him, and I have\r\ncome to let you know of it, because I believe you might have power to\r\ndrive it away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? What is the trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite a secret. It is that he may refuse to marry Thomasin\r\nYeobright after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEustacia, though set inwardly pulsing by his words, was equal to her\r\npart in such a drama as this. She replied coldly, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not wish to\r\nlisten to this, and you must not expect me to interfere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, miss, you will hear one word?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot. I am not interested in the marriage, and even if I were I\r\ncould not compel Mr. Wildeve to do my bidding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs the only lady on the heath I think you might,\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn with\r\nsubtle indirectness. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is how the case stands. Mr. Wildeve would\r\nmarry Thomasin at once, and make all matters smooth, if so be there\r\nwere not another woman in the case. This other woman is some person he\r\nhas picked up with, and meets on the heath occasionally, I believe. He\r\nwill never marry her, and yet through her he may never marry the woman\r\nwho loves him dearly. Now, if you, miss, who have so much sway over us\r\nmenfolk, were to insist that he should treat your young neighbour\r\nTamsin with honourable kindness and give up the other woman, he would\r\nperhaps do it, and save her a good deal of misery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my life!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia, with a laugh which unclosed her lips so\r\nthat the sun shone into her mouth as into a tulip, and lent it a\r\nsimilar scarlet fire. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think too much of my influence over menfolk\r\nindeed, reddleman. If I had such a power as you imagine I would go\r\nstraight and use it for the good of anybody who has been kind to\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94which Thomasin Yeobright has not particularly, to my knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan it be that you really don\xe2\x80\x99t know of it\xe2\x80\x94how much she had always\r\nthought of you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never heard a word of it. Although we live only two miles apart\r\nI have never been inside her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s house in my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe superciliousness that lurked in her manner told Venn that thus far\r\nhe had utterly failed. He inwardly sighed and felt it necessary to\r\nunmask his second argument.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, leaving that out of the question, \xe2\x80\x99tis in your power, I assure\r\nyou, Miss Vye, to do a great deal of good to another woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour comeliness is law with Mr. Wildeve. It is law with all men who\r\nsee \xe2\x80\x99ee. They say, \xe2\x80\x98This well-favoured lady coming\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s her name? How\r\nhandsome!\xe2\x80\x99 Handsomer than Thomasin Yeobright,\xe2\x80\x9d the reddleman persisted,\r\nsaying to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cGod forgive a rascal for lying!\xe2\x80\x9d And she was\r\nhandsomer, but the reddleman was far from thinking so. There was a\r\ncertain obscurity in Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s beauty, and Venn\xe2\x80\x99s eye was not trained.\r\nIn her winter dress, as now, she was like the tiger-beetle, which, when\r\nobserved in dull situations, seems to be of the quietest neutral\r\ncolour, but under a full illumination blazes with dazzling splendour.\r\n\r\nEustacia could not help replying, though conscious that she endangered\r\nher dignity thereby. \xe2\x80\x9cMany women are lovelier than Thomasin,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cso not much attaches to that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reddleman suffered the wound and went on: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a man who notices\r\nthe looks of women, and you could twist him to your will like\r\nwithywind, if you only had the mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely what she cannot do who has been so much with him I cannot do\r\nliving up here away from him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reddleman wheeled and looked her in the face. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vye!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you say that\xe2\x80\x94as if you doubted me?\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke faintly, and her\r\nbreathing was quick. \xe2\x80\x9cThe idea of your speaking in that tone to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe added, with a forced smile of hauteur. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat could have been in\r\nyour mind to lead you to speak like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vye, why should you make believe that you don\xe2\x80\x99t know this man?\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nknow why, certainly. He is beneath you, and you are ashamed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mistaken. What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reddleman had decided to play the card of truth. \xe2\x80\x9cI was at the\r\nmeeting by Rainbarrow last night and heard every word,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nwoman that stands between Wildeve and Thomasin is yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a disconcerting lift of the curtain, and the mortification of\r\nCandaules\xe2\x80\x99 wife glowed in her. The moment had arrived when her lip\r\nwould tremble in spite of herself, and when the gasp could no longer be\r\nkept down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am unwell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said hurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94it is not that\xe2\x80\x94I am not in a\r\nhumour to hear you further. Leave me, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must speak, Miss Vye, in spite of paining you. What I would put\r\nbefore you is this. However it may come about\xe2\x80\x94whether she is to blame,\r\nor you\xe2\x80\x94her case is without doubt worse than yours. Your giving up Mr.\r\nWildeve will be a real advantage to you, for how could you marry him?\r\nNow she cannot get off so easily\xe2\x80\x94everybody will blame her if she loses\r\nhim. Then I ask you\xe2\x80\x94not because her right is best, but because her\r\nsituation is worst\xe2\x80\x94to give him up to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t, I won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d she said impetuously, quite forgetful of her\r\nprevious manner towards the reddleman as an underling. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody has ever\r\nbeen served so! It was going on well\xe2\x80\x94I will not be beaten down\xe2\x80\x94by an\r\ninferior woman like her. It is very well for you to come and plead for\r\nher, but is she not herself the cause of all her own trouble? Am I not\r\nto show favour to any person I may choose without asking permission of\r\na parcel of cottagers? She has come between me and my inclination, and\r\nnow that she finds herself rightly punished she gets you to plead for\r\nher!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cshe knows nothing whatever about it. It\r\nis only I who ask you to give him up. It will be better for her and you\r\nboth. People will say bad things if they find out that a lady secretly\r\nmeets a man who has ill-used another woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have _not_ injured her\xe2\x80\x94he was mine before he was hers! He came\r\nback\xe2\x80\x94because\xe2\x80\x94because he liked me best!\xe2\x80\x9d she said wildly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I lose\r\nall self-respect in talking to you. What am I giving way to!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can keep secrets,\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn gently. \xe2\x80\x9cYou need not fear. I am the\r\nonly man who knows of your meetings with him. There is but one thing\r\nmore to speak of, and then I will be gone. I heard you say to him that\r\nyou hated living here\xe2\x80\x94that Egdon Heath was a jail to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did say so. There is a sort of beauty in the scenery, I know; but it\r\nis a jail to me. The man you mention does not save me from that\r\nfeeling, though he lives here. I should have cared nothing for him had\r\nthere been a better person near.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reddleman looked hopeful; after these words from her his third\r\nattempt seemed promising. \xe2\x80\x9cAs we have now opened our minds a bit,\r\nmiss,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I have got to propose. Since I have\r\ntaken to the reddle trade I travel a good deal, as you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe inclined her head, and swept round so that her eyes rested in the\r\nmisty vale beneath them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in my travels I go near Budmouth. Now Budmouth is a wonderful\r\nplace\xe2\x80\x94wonderful\xe2\x80\x94a great salt sheening sea bending into the land like a\r\nbow\xe2\x80\x94thousands of gentlepeople walking up and down\xe2\x80\x94bands of music\r\nplaying\xe2\x80\x94officers by sea and officers by land walking among the rest\xe2\x80\x94out\r\nof every ten folks you meet nine of \xe2\x80\x99em in love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said disdainfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI know Budmouth better than you. I\r\nwas born there. My father came to be a military musician there from\r\nabroad. Ah, my soul, Budmouth! I wish I was there now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reddleman was surprised to see how a slow fire could blaze on\r\noccasion. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you were, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cin a week\xe2\x80\x99s time you would\r\nthink no more of Wildeve than of one of those he\xe2\x80\x99th-croppers that we\r\nsee yond. Now, I could get you there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia, with intense curiosity in her heavy eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy uncle has been for five and twenty years the trusty man of a rich\r\nwidow-lady who has a beautiful house facing the sea. This lady has\r\nbecome old and lame, and she wants a young company-keeper to read and\r\nsing to her, but can\xe2\x80\x99t get one to her mind to save her life, though\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ve advertised in the papers, and tried half a dozen. She would jump\r\nto get you, and Uncle would make it all easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have to work, perhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not real work\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99d have a little to do, such as reading and that.\r\nYou would not be wanted till New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew it meant work,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, drooping to languor again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI confess there would be a trifle to do in the way of amusing her; but\r\nthough idle people might call it work, working people would call it\r\nplay. Think of the company and the life you\xe2\x80\x99d lead, miss; the gaiety\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d see, and the gentleman you\xe2\x80\x99d marry. My uncle is to inquire for a\r\ntrustworthy young lady from the country, as she don\xe2\x80\x99t like town girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is to wear myself out to please her! and I won\xe2\x80\x99t go. O, if I could\r\nlive in a gay town as a lady should, and go my own ways, and do my own\r\ndoings, I\xe2\x80\x99d give the wrinkled half of my life! Yes, reddleman, that\r\nwould I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp me to get Thomasin happy, miss, and the chance shall be yours,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nurged her companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChance\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis no chance,\xe2\x80\x9d she said proudly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can a poor man like\r\nyou offer me, indeed?\xe2\x80\x94I am going indoors. I have nothing more to say.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t your horses want feeding, or your reddlebags want mending, or\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you want to find buyers for your goods, that you stay idling here\r\nlike this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVenn spoke not another word. With his hands behind him he turned away,\r\nthat she might not see the hopeless disappointment in his face. The\r\nmental clearness and power he had found in this lonely girl had indeed\r\nfilled his manner with misgiving even from the first few minutes of\r\nclose quarters with her. Her youth and situation had led him to expect\r\na simplicity quite at the beck of his method. But a system of\r\ninducement which might have carried weaker country lasses along with it\r\nhad merely repelled Eustacia. As a rule, the word Budmouth meant\r\nfascination on Egdon. That Royal port and watering place, if truly\r\nmirrored in the minds of the heathfolk, must have combined, in a\r\ncharming and indescribable manner a Carthaginian bustle of building\r\nwith Tarentine luxuriousness and Baian health and beauty. Eustacia felt\r\nlittle less extravagantly about the place; but she would not sink her\r\nindependence to get there.\r\n\r\nWhen Diggory Venn had gone quite away, Eustacia walked to the bank and\r\nlooked down the wild and picturesque vale towards the sun, which was\r\nalso in the direction of Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s. The mist had now so far collapsed\r\nthat the tips of the trees and bushes around his house could just be\r\ndiscerned, as if boring upwards through a vast white cobweb which\r\ncloaked them from the day. There was no doubt that her mind was\r\ninclined thitherward; indefinitely, fancifully\xe2\x80\x94twining and untwining\r\nabout him as the single object within her horizon on which dreams might\r\ncrystallize. The man who had begun by being merely her amusement, and\r\nwould never have been more than her hobby but for his skill in\r\ndeserting her at the right moments, was now again her desire. Cessation\r\nin his love-making had revivified her love. Such feeling as Eustacia\r\nhad idly given to Wildeve was dammed into a flood by Thomasin. She had\r\nused to tease Wildeve, but that was before another had favoured him.\r\nOften a drop of irony into an indifferent situation renders the whole\r\npiquant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will never give him up\xe2\x80\x94never!\xe2\x80\x9d she said impetuously.\r\n\r\nThe reddleman\xe2\x80\x99s hint that rumour might show her to disadvantage had no\r\npermanent terror for Eustacia. She was as unconcerned at that\r\ncontingency as a goddess at a lack of linen. This did not originate in\r\ninherent shamelessness, but in her living too far from the world to\r\nfeel the impact of public opinion. Zenobia in the desert could hardly\r\nhave cared what was said about her at Rome. As far as social ethics\r\nwere concerned Eustacia approached the savage state, though in emotion\r\nshe was all the while an epicure. She had advanced to the secret\r\nrecesses of sensuousness, yet had hardly crossed the threshold of\r\nconventionality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\nThe Dishonesty of an Honest Woman\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reddleman had left Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s presence with desponding views on\r\nThomasin\xe2\x80\x99s future happiness; but he was awakened to the fact that one\r\nother channel remained untried by seeing, as he followed the way to his\r\nvan, the form of Mrs. Yeobright slowly walking towards the Quiet Woman.\r\nHe went across to her; and could almost perceive in her anxious face\r\nthat this journey of hers to Wildeve was undertaken with the same\r\nobject as his own to Eustacia.\r\n\r\nShe did not conceal the fact. \xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reddleman, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may as\r\nwell leave it alone, Mrs. Yeobright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI half think so myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut nothing else remains to be\r\ndone besides pressing the question upon him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to say a word first,\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Wildeve is\r\nnot the only man who has asked Thomasin to marry him; and why should\r\nnot another have a chance? Mrs. Yeobright, I should be glad to marry\r\nyour niece and would have done it any time these last two years. There,\r\nnow it is out, and I have never told anybody before but herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Yeobright was not demonstrative, but her eyes involuntarily\r\nglanced towards his singular though shapely figure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLooks are not everything,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reddleman, noticing the glance.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s many a calling that don\xe2\x80\x99t bring in so much as mine, if it\r\ncomes to money; and perhaps I am not so much worse off than Wildeve.\r\nThere is nobody so poor as these professional fellows who have failed;\r\nand if you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like my redness\xe2\x80\x94well, I am not red by birth, you\r\nknow; I only took to this business for a freak; and I might turn my\r\nhand to something else in good time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am much obliged to you for your interest in my niece; but I fear\r\nthere would be objections. More than that, she is devoted to this man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue; or I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done what I have this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOtherwise there would be no pain in the case, and you would not see me\r\ngoing to his house now. What was Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s answer when you told her of\r\nyour feelings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wrote that you would object to me; and other things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was in a measure right. You must not take this unkindly\xe2\x80\x94I merely\r\nstate it as a truth. You have been good to her, and we do not forget\r\nit. But as she was unwilling on her own account to be your wife, that\r\nsettles the point without my wishes being concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. But there is a difference between then and now, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. She is\r\ndistressed now, and I have thought that if you were to talk to her\r\nabout me, and think favourably of me yourself, there might be a chance\r\nof winning her round, and getting her quite independent of this\r\nWildeve\xe2\x80\x99s backward and forward play, and his not knowing whether he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave her or no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Yeobright shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cThomasin thinks, and I think with her,\r\nthat she ought to be Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s wife, if she means to appear before the\r\nworld without a slur upon her name. If they marry soon, everybody will\r\nbelieve that an accident did really prevent the wedding. If not, it may\r\ncast a shade upon her character\xe2\x80\x94at any rate make her ridiculous. In\r\nshort, if it is anyhow possible they must marry now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought that till half an hour ago. But, after all, why should her\r\ngoing off with him to Anglebury for a few hours do her any harm?\r\nAnybody who knows how pure she is will feel any such thought to be\r\nquite unjust. I have been trying this morning to help on this marriage\r\nwith Wildeve\xe2\x80\x94yes, I, ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x94in the belief that I ought to do it, because\r\nshe was so wrapped up in him. But I much question if I was right, after\r\nall. However, nothing came of it. And now I offer myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Yeobright appeared disinclined to enter further into the question.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear I must go on,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not see that anything else can\r\nbe done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she went on. But though this conversation did not divert Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naunt from her purposed interview with Wildeve, it made a considerable\r\ndifference in her mode of conducting that interview. She thanked God\r\nfor the weapon which the reddleman had put into her hands.\r\n\r\nWildeve was at home when she reached the inn. He showed her silently\r\ninto the parlour, and closed the door. Mrs. Yeobright began\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have thought it my duty to call today. A new proposal has been made\r\nto me, which has rather astonished me. It will affect Thomasin greatly;\r\nand I have decided that it should at least be mentioned to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes? What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said civilly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, of course, in reference to her future. You may not be aware\r\nthat another man has shown himself anxious to marry Thomasin. Now,\r\nthough I have not encouraged him yet, I cannot conscientiously refuse\r\nhim a chance any longer. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to be short with you; but I must\r\nbe fair to him and to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is the man?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve with surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne who has been in love with her longer than she has with you. He\r\nproposed to her two years ago. At that time she refused him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has seen her lately, and has asked me for permission to pay his\r\naddresses to her. She may not refuse him twice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is his name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Yeobright declined to say. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a man Thomasin likes,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cand one whose constancy she respects at least. It seems to me\r\nthat what she refused then she would be glad to get now. She is much\r\nannoyed at her awkward position.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe never once told me of this old lover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gentlest women are not such fools as to show _every_ card.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if she wants him I suppose she must have him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is easy enough to say that; but you don\xe2\x80\x99t see the difficulty. He\r\nwants her much more than she wants him; and before I can encourage\r\nanything of the sort I must have a clear understanding from you that\r\nyou will not interfere to injure an arrangement which I promote in the\r\nbelief that it is for the best. Suppose, when they are engaged, and\r\neverything is smoothly arranged for their marriage, that you should\r\nstep between them and renew your suit? You might not win her back, but\r\nyou might cause much unhappiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I should do no such thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve \xe2\x80\x9cBut they are not\r\nengaged yet. How do you know that Thomasin would accept him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a question I have carefully put to myself; and upon the whole\r\nthe probabilities are in favour of her accepting him in time. I flatter\r\nmyself that I have some influence over her. She is pliable, and I can\r\nbe strong in my recommendations of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in your disparagement of me at the same time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you may depend upon my not praising you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said drily. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nif this seems like man\xc5\x93uvring, you must remember that her position is\r\npeculiar, and that she has been hardly used. I shall also be helped in\r\nmaking the match by her own desire to escape from the humiliation of\r\nher present state; and a woman\xe2\x80\x99s pride in these cases will lead her a\r\nvery great way. A little managing may be required to bring her round;\r\nbut I am equal to that, provided that you agree to the one thing\r\nindispensable; that is, to make a distinct declaration that she is to\r\nthink no more of you as a possible husband. That will pique her into\r\naccepting him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can hardly say that just now, Mrs. Yeobright. It is so sudden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so my whole plan is interfered with! It is very inconvenient that\r\nyou refuse to help my family even to the small extent of saying\r\ndistinctly you will have nothing to do with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWildeve reflected uncomfortably. \xe2\x80\x9cI confess I was not prepared for\r\nthis,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I\xe2\x80\x99ll give her up if you wish, if it is\r\nnecessary. But I thought I might be her husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have heard that before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mrs. Yeobright, don\xe2\x80\x99t let us disagree. Give me a fair time. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to stand in the way of any better chance she may have; only\r\nI wish you had let me know earlier. I will write to you or call in a\r\nday or two. Will that suffice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cprovided you promise not to communicate with\r\nThomasin without my knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. And the interview then terminated, Mrs.\r\nYeobright returning homeward as she had come.\r\n\r\nBy far the greatest effect of her simple strategy on that day was, as\r\noften happens, in a quarter quite outside her view when arranging it.\r\nIn the first place, her visit sent Wildeve the same evening after dark\r\nto Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s house at Mistover.\r\n\r\nAt this hour the lonely dwelling was closely blinded and shuttered from\r\nthe chill and darkness without. Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s clandestine plan with her was\r\nto take a little gravel in his hand and hold it to the crevice at the\r\ntop of the window shutter, which was on the outside, so that it should\r\nfall with a gentle rustle, resembling that of a mouse, between shutter\r\nand glass. This precaution in attracting her attention was to avoid\r\narousing the suspicions of her grandfather.\r\n\r\nThe soft words, \xe2\x80\x9cI hear; wait for me,\xe2\x80\x9d in Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s voice from within\r\ntold him that she was alone.\r\n\r\nHe waited in his customary manner by walking round the enclosure and\r\nidling by the pool, for Wildeve was never asked into the house by his\r\nproud though condescending mistress. She showed no sign of coming out\r\nin a hurry. The time wore on, and he began to grow impatient. In the\r\ncourse of twenty minutes she appeared from round the corner, and\r\nadvanced as if merely taking an airing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would not have kept me so long had you known what I come about,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said with bitterness. \xe2\x80\x9cStill, you are worth waiting for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia. \xe2\x80\x9cI did not know you were in\r\ntrouble. I too am gloomy enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not in trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is merely that affairs have come to\r\na head, and I must take a clear course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat course is that?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked with attentive interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd can you forget so soon what I proposed to you the other night?\r\nWhy, take you from this place, and carry you away with me abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not forgotten. But why have you come so unexpectedly to repeat\r\nthe question, when you only promised to come next Saturday? I thought I\r\nwas to have plenty of time to consider.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but the situation is different now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExplain to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to explain, for I may pain you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I must know the reason of this hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is simply my ardour, dear Eustacia. Everything is smooth now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why are you so ruffled?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not aware of it. All is as it should be. Mrs. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x94but she\r\nis nothing to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I knew she had something to do with it! Come, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nreserve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94she has nothing. She only says she wishes me to give up Thomasin\r\nbecause another man is anxious to marry her. The woman, now she no\r\nlonger needs me, actually shows off!\xe2\x80\x9d Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s vexation has escaped\r\nhim in spite of himself.\r\n\r\nEustacia was silent a long while. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are in the awkward position of\r\nan official who is no longer wanted,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a changed tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems so. But I have not yet seen Thomasin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that irritates you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t deny it, Damon. You are actually nettled\r\nby this slight from an unexpected quarter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you come to get me because you cannot get her. This is certainly a\r\nnew position altogether. I am to be a stop-gap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease remember that I proposed the same thing the other day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEustacia again remained in a sort of stupefied silence. What curious\r\nfeeling was this coming over her? Was it really possible that her\r\ninterest in Wildeve had been so entirely the result of antagonism that\r\nthe glory and the dream departed from the man with the first sound that\r\nhe was no longer coveted by her rival? She was, then, secure of him at\r\nlast. Thomasin no longer required him. What a humiliating victory! He\r\nloved her best, she thought; and yet\xe2\x80\x94dared she to murmur such\r\ntreacherous criticism ever so softly?\xe2\x80\x94what was the man worth whom a\r\nwoman inferior to herself did not value? The sentiment which lurks more\r\nor less in all animate nature\xe2\x80\x94that of not desiring the undesired of\r\nothers\xe2\x80\x94was lively as a passion in the supersubtle, epicurean heart of\r\nEustacia. Her social superiority over him, which hitherto had scarcely\r\never impressed her, became unpleasantly insistent, and for the first\r\ntime she felt that she had stooped in loving him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, darling, you agree?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it could be London, or even Budmouth, instead of America,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nmurmured languidly. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will think. It is too great a thing for me\r\nto decide offhand. I wish I hated the heath less\xe2\x80\x94or loved you more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can be painfully frank. You loved me a month ago warmly enough to\r\ngo anywhere with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you loved Thomasin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, perhaps that was where the reason lay,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, with almost\r\na sneer. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t hate her now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. The only thing is that you can no longer get her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome\xe2\x80\x94no taunts, Eustacia, or we shall quarrel. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t agree to\r\ngo with me, and agree shortly, I shall go by myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr try Thomasin again. Damon, how strange it seems that you could have\r\nmarried her or me indifferently, and only have come to me because I\r\nam\xe2\x80\x94cheapest! Yes, yes\xe2\x80\x94it is true. There was a time when I should have\r\nexclaimed against a man of that sort, and been quite wild; but it is\r\nall past now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you go, dearest? Come secretly with me to Bristol, marry me, and\r\nturn our backs upon this dog-hole of England for ever? Say Yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to get away from here at almost any cost,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with\r\nweariness, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to go with you. Give me more time to\r\ndecide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have already,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I give you one more week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little longer, so that I may tell you decisively. I have to consider\r\nso many things. Fancy Thomasin being anxious to get rid of you! I\r\ncannot forget it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind that. Say Monday week. I will be here precisely at this\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it be at Rainbarrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is too near home; my\r\ngrandfather may be walking out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, dear. On Monday week at this time I will be at the Barrow.\r\nTill then good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye. No, no, you must not touch me now. Shaking hands is enough\r\ntill I have made up my mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEustacia watched his shadowy form till it had disappeared. She placed\r\nher hand to her forehead and breathed heavily; and then her rich,\r\nromantic lips parted under that homely impulse\xe2\x80\x94a yawn. She was\r\nimmediately angry at having betrayed even to herself the possible\r\nevanescence of her passion for him. She could not admit at once that\r\nshe might have overestimated Wildeve, for to perceive his mediocrity\r\nnow was to admit her own great folly heretofore. And the discovery that\r\nshe was the owner of a disposition so purely that of the dog in the\r\nmanger had something in it which at first made her ashamed.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of Mrs. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s diplomacy was indeed remarkable, though\r\nnot as yet of the kind she had anticipated. It had appreciably\r\ninfluenced Wildeve, but it was influencing Eustacia far more. Her lover\r\nwas no longer to her an exciting man whom many women strove for, and\r\nherself could only retain by striving with them. He was a superfluity.\r\n\r\nShe went indoors in that peculiar state of misery which is not exactly\r\ngrief, and which especially attends the dawnings of reason in the\r\nlatter days of an ill-judged, transient love. To be conscious that the\r\nend of the dream is approaching, and yet has not absolutely come, is\r\none of the most wearisome as well as the most curious stages along the\r\ncourse between the beginning of a passion and its end.\r\n\r\nHer grandfather had returned, and was busily engaged in pouring some\r\ngallons of newly arrived rum into the square bottles of his square\r\ncellaret. Whenever these home supplies were exhausted he would go to\r\nthe Quiet Woman, and, standing with his back to the fire, grog in hand,\r\ntell remarkable stories of how he had lived seven years under the\r\nwaterline of his ship, and other naval wonders, to the natives, who\r\nhoped too earnestly for a treat of ale from the teller to exhibit any\r\ndoubts of his truth.\r\n\r\nHe had been there this evening. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you have heard the Egdon\r\nnews, Eustacia?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, without looking up from the bottles. \xe2\x80\x9cThe men\r\nhave been talking about it at the Woman as if it were of national\r\nimportance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard none,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung Clym Yeobright, as they call him, is coming home next week to\r\nspend Christmas with his mother. He is a fine fellow by this time, it\r\nseems. I suppose you remember him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never saw him in my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, true; he left before you came here. I well remember him as a\r\npromising boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere has he been living all these years?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that rookery of pomp and vanity, Paris, I believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK SECOND\xe2\x80\x94THE ARRIVAL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\nTidings of the Comer\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the fine days at this time of the year, and earlier, certain\r\nephemeral operations were apt to disturb, in their trifling way, the\r\nmajestic calm of Egdon Heath. They were activities which, beside those\r\nof a town, a village, or even a farm, would have appeared as the\r\nferment of stagnation merely, a creeping of the flesh of somnolence.\r\nBut here, away from comparisons, shut in by the stable hills, among\r\nwhich mere walking had the novelty of pageantry, and where any man\r\ncould imagine himself to be Adam without the least difficulty, they\r\nattracted the attention of every bird within eyeshot, every reptile not\r\nyet asleep, and set the surrounding rabbits curiously watching from\r\nhillocks at a safe distance.\r\n\r\nThe performance was that of bringing together and building into a stack\r\nthe furze faggots which Humphrey had been cutting for the captain\xe2\x80\x99s use\r\nduring the foregoing fine days. The stack was at the end of the\r\ndwelling, and the men engaged in building it were Humphrey and Sam, the\r\nold man looking on.\r\n\r\nIt was a fine and quiet afternoon, about three o\xe2\x80\x99clock; but the winter\r\nsolstice having stealthily come on, the lowness of the sun caused the\r\nhour to seem later than it actually was, there being little here to\r\nremind an inhabitant that he must unlearn his summer experience of the\r\nsky as a dial. In the course of many days and weeks sunrise had\r\nadvanced its quarters from northeast to southeast, sunset had receded\r\nfrom northwest to southwest; but Egdon had hardly heeded the change.\r\n\r\nEustacia was indoors in the dining-room, which was really more like a\r\nkitchen, having a stone floor and a gaping chimney-corner. The air was\r\nstill, and while she lingered a moment here alone sounds of voices in\r\nconversation came to her ears directly down the chimney. She entered\r\nthe recess, and, listening, looked up the old irregular shaft, with its\r\ncavernous hollows, where the smoke blundered about on its way to the\r\nsquare bit of sky at the top, from which the daylight struck down with\r\na pallid glare upon the tatters of soot draping the flue as seaweed\r\ndrapes a rocky fissure.\r\n\r\nShe remembered: the furze-stack was not far from the chimney, and the\r\nvoices were those of the workers.\r\n\r\nHer grandfather joined in the conversation. \xe2\x80\x9cThat lad ought never to\r\nhave left home. His father\xe2\x80\x99s occupation would have suited him best, and\r\nthe boy should have followed on. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in these new moves in\r\nfamilies. My father was a sailor, so was I, and so should my son have\r\nbeen if I had had one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe place he\xe2\x80\x99s been living at is Paris,\xe2\x80\x9d said Humphrey, \xe2\x80\x9cand they tell\r\nme \xe2\x80\x99tis where the king\xe2\x80\x99s head was cut off years ago. My poor mother\r\nused to tell me about that business. \xe2\x80\x98Hummy,\xe2\x80\x99 she used to say, \xe2\x80\x98I was a\r\nyoung maid then, and as I was at home ironing Mother\xe2\x80\x99s caps one\r\nafternoon the parson came in and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve cut the king\xe2\x80\x99s head\r\noff, Jane; and what \xe2\x80\x99twill be next God knows.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good many of us knew as well as He before long,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain,\r\nchuckling. \xe2\x80\x9cI lived seven years under water on account of it in my\r\nboyhood\xe2\x80\x94in that damned surgery of the Triumph, seeing men brought down\r\nto the cockpit with their legs and arms blown to Jericho.... And so the\r\nyoung man has settled in Paris. Manager to a diamond merchant, or some\r\nsuch thing, is he not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. \xe2\x80\x99Tis a blazing great business that he belongs to,\r\nso I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard his mother say\xe2\x80\x94like a king\xe2\x80\x99s palace, as far as diments\r\ngo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can well mind when he left home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a good thing for the feller,\xe2\x80\x9d said Humphrey. \xe2\x80\x9cA sight of times\r\nbetter to be selling diments than nobbling about here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must cost a good few shillings to deal at such a place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good few indeed, my man,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, you may make\r\naway with a deal of money and be neither drunkard nor glutton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say, too, that Clym Yeobright is become a real perusing man, with\r\nthe strangest notions about things. There, that\xe2\x80\x99s because he went to\r\nschool early, such as the school was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange notions, has he?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, there\xe2\x80\x99s too much of\r\nthat sending to school in these days! It only does harm. Every gatepost\r\nand barn\xe2\x80\x99s door you come to is sure to have some bad word or other\r\nchalked upon it by the young rascals\xe2\x80\x94a woman can hardly pass for shame\r\nsometimes. If they\xe2\x80\x99d never been taught how to write they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nbeen able to scribble such villainy. Their fathers couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it, and\r\nthe country was all the better for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I should think, Cap\xe2\x80\x99n, that Miss Eustacia had about as much in\r\nher head that comes from books as anybody about here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps if Miss Eustacia, too, had less romantic nonsense in her head\r\nit would be better for her,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain shortly; after which he\r\nwalked away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Sam,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Humphrey when the old man was gone, \xe2\x80\x9cshe and\r\nClym Yeobright would make a very pretty pigeon-pair\xe2\x80\x94hey? If they\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I\xe2\x80\x99ll be dazed! Both of one mind about niceties for certain,\r\nand learned in print, and always thinking about high doctrine\xe2\x80\x94there\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a better couple if they were made o\xe2\x80\x99 purpose. Clym\xe2\x80\x99s family\r\nis as good as hers. His father was a farmer, that\xe2\x80\x99s true; but his\r\nmother was a sort of lady, as we know. Nothing would please me better\r\nthan to see them two man and wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99d look very natty, arm-in-crook together, and their best clothes\r\non, whether or no, if he\xe2\x80\x99s at all the well-favoured fellow he used to\r\nbe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey would, Humphrey. Well, I should like to see the chap terrible\r\nmuch after so many years. If I knew for certain when he was coming I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nstroll out three or four miles to meet him and help carry anything\r\nfor\xe2\x80\x99n; though I suppose he\xe2\x80\x99s altered from the boy he was. They say he\r\ncan talk French as fast as a maid can eat blackberries; and if so,\r\ndepend upon it we who have stayed at home shall seem no more than\r\nscroff in his eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComing across the water to Budmouth by steamer, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but how he\xe2\x80\x99s coming from Budmouth I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a bad trouble about his cousin Thomasin. I wonder such a\r\nnice-notioned fellow as Clym likes to come home into it. What a\r\nnunnywatch we were in, to be sure, when we heard they weren\xe2\x80\x99t married\r\nat all, after singing to \xe2\x80\x99em as man and wife that night! Be dazed if I\r\nshould like a relation of mine to have been made such a fool of by a\r\nman. It makes the family look small.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Poor maid, her heart has ached enough about it. Her health is\r\nsuffering from it, I hear, for she will bide entirely indoors. We never\r\nsee her out now, scampering over the furze with a face as red as a\r\nrose, as she used to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have Wildeve now if he asked her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have? \xe2\x80\x99Tis news to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile the furze-gatherers had desultorily conversed thus Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface gradually bent to the hearth in a profound reverie, her toe\r\nunconsciously tapping the dry turf which lay burning at her feet.\r\n\r\nThe subject of their discourse had been keenly interesting to her. A\r\nyoung and clever man was coming into that lonely heath from, of all\r\ncontrasting places in the world, Paris. It was like a man coming from\r\nheaven. More singular still, the heathmen had instinctively coupled her\r\nand this man together in their minds as a pair born for each other.\r\n\r\nThat five minutes of overhearing furnished Eustacia with visions enough\r\nto fill the whole blank afternoon. Such sudden alternations from mental\r\nvacuity do sometimes occur thus quietly. She could never have believed\r\nin the morning that her colourless inner world would before night\r\nbecome as animated as water under a microscope, and that without the\r\narrival of a single visitor. The words of Sam and Humphrey on the\r\nharmony between the unknown and herself had on her mind the effect of\r\nthe invading Bard\xe2\x80\x99s prelude in the Castle of Indolence, at which\r\nmyriads of imprisoned shapes arose where had previously appeared the\r\nstillness of a void.\r\n\r\nInvolved in these imaginings she knew nothing of time. When she became\r\nconscious of externals it was dusk. The furze-rick was finished; the\r\nmen had gone home. Eustacia went upstairs, thinking that she would take\r\na walk at this her usual time; and she determined that her walk should\r\nbe in the direction of Blooms-End, the birthplace of young Yeobright\r\nand the present home of his mother. She had no reason for walking\r\nelsewhere, and why should she not go that way? The scene of the\r\ndaydream is sufficient for a pilgrimage at nineteen. To look at the\r\npalings before the Yeobrights\xe2\x80\x99 house had the dignity of a necessary\r\nperformance. Strange that such a piece of idling should have seemed an\r\nimportant errand.\r\n\r\nShe put on her bonnet, and, leaving the house, descended the hill on\r\nthe side towards Blooms-End, where she walked slowly along the valley\r\nfor a distance of a mile and a half. This brought her to a spot in\r\nwhich the green bottom of the dale began to widen, the furze bushes to\r\nrecede yet further from the path on each side, till they were\r\ndiminished to an isolated one here and there by the increasing\r\nfertility of the soil. Beyond the irregular carpet of grass was a row\r\nof white palings, which marked the verge of the heath in this latitude.\r\nThey showed upon the dusky scene that they bordered as distinctly as\r\nwhite lace on velvet. Behind the white palings was a little garden;\r\nbehind the garden an old, irregular, thatched house, facing the heath,\r\nand commanding a full view of the valley. This was the obscure, removed\r\nspot to which was about to return a man whose latter life had been\r\npassed in the French capital\xe2\x80\x94the centre and vortex of the fashionable\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\nThe People at Blooms-End Make Ready\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that afternoon the expected arrival of the subject of Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nruminations created a bustle of preparation at Blooms-End. Thomasin had\r\nbeen persuaded by her aunt, and by an instinctive impulse of loyalty\r\ntowards her cousin Clym, to bestir herself on his account with an\r\nalacrity unusual in her during these most sorrowful days of her life.\r\nAt the time that Eustacia was listening to the rick-makers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nconversation on Clym\xe2\x80\x99s return, Thomasin was climbing into a loft over\r\nher aunt\xe2\x80\x99s fuelhouse, where the store-apples were kept, to search out\r\nthe best and largest of them for the coming holiday-time.\r\n\r\nThe loft was lighted by a semicircular hole, through which the pigeons\r\ncrept to their lodgings in the same high quarters of the premises; and\r\nfrom this hole the sun shone in a bright yellow patch upon the figure\r\nof the maiden as she knelt and plunged her naked arms into the soft\r\nbrown fern, which, from its abundance, was used on Egdon in packing\r\naway stores of all kinds. The pigeons were flying about her head with\r\nthe greatest unconcern, and the face of her aunt was just visible above\r\nthe floor of the loft, lit by a few stray motes of light, as she stood\r\nhalfway up the ladder, looking at a spot into which she was not climber\r\nenough to venture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow a few russets, Tamsin. He used to like them almost as well as\r\nribstones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThomasin turned and rolled aside the fern from another nook, where more\r\nmellow fruit greeted her with its ripe smell. Before picking them out\r\nshe stopped a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Clym, I wonder how your face looks now?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, gazing\r\nabstractedly at the pigeon-hole, which admitted the sunlight so\r\ndirectly upon her brown hair and transparent tissues that it almost\r\nseemed to shine through her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he could have been dear to you in another way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright\r\nfrom the ladder, \xe2\x80\x9cthis might have been a happy meeting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there any use in saying what can do no good, Aunt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said her aunt, with some warmth. \xe2\x80\x9cTo thoroughly fill the air\r\nwith the past misfortune, so that other girls may take warning and keep\r\nclear of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThomasin lowered her face to the apples again. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a warning to\r\nothers, just as thieves and drunkards and gamblers are,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a\r\nlow voice. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a class to belong to! Do I really belong to them? \xe2\x80\x99Tis\r\nabsurd! Yet why, Aunt, does everybody keep on making me think that I\r\ndo, by the way they behave towards me? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t people judge me by my\r\nacts? Now, look at me as I kneel here, picking up these apples\xe2\x80\x94do I\r\nlook like a lost woman?... I wish all good women were as good as I!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe added vehemently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrangers don\xe2\x80\x99t see you as I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright; \xe2\x80\x9cthey judge\r\nfrom false report. Well, it is a silly job, and I am partly to blame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow quickly a rash thing can be done!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl. Her lips were\r\nquivering, and tears so crowded themselves into her eyes that she could\r\nhardly distinguish apples from fern as she continued industriously\r\nsearching to hide her weakness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as you have finished getting the apples,\xe2\x80\x9d her aunt said,\r\ndescending the ladder, \xe2\x80\x9ccome down, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll go for the holly. There is\r\nnobody on the heath this afternoon, and you need not fear being stared\r\nat. We must get some berries, or Clym will never believe in our\r\npreparations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThomasin came down when the apples were collected, and together they\r\nwent through the white palings to the heath beyond. The open hills were\r\nairy and clear, and the remote atmosphere appeared, as it often appears\r\non a fine winter day, in distinct planes of illumination independently\r\ntoned, the rays which lit the nearer tracts of landscape streaming\r\nvisibly across those further off; a stratum of ensaffroned light was\r\nimposed on a stratum of deep blue, and behind these lay still remoter\r\nscenes wrapped in frigid grey.\r\n\r\nThey reached the place where the hollies grew, which was in a conical\r\npit, so that the tops of the trees were not much above the general\r\nlevel of the ground. Thomasin stepped up into a fork of one of the\r\nbushes, as she had done under happier circumstances on many similar\r\noccasions, and with a small chopper that they had brought she began to\r\nlop off the heavily berried boughs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t scratch your face,\xe2\x80\x9d said her aunt, who stood at the edge of the\r\npit, regarding the girl as she held on amid the glistening green and\r\nscarlet masses of the tree. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you walk with me to meet him this\r\nevening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to. Else it would seem as if I had forgotten him,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nThomasin, tossing out a bough. \xe2\x80\x9cNot that that would matter much; I\r\nbelong to one man; nothing can alter that. And that man I must marry,\r\nfor my pride\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d began Mrs. Yeobright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you think, \xe2\x80\x98That weak girl\xe2\x80\x94how is she going to get a man to marry\r\nher when she chooses?\xe2\x80\x99 But let me tell you one thing, Aunt: Mr. Wildeve\r\nis not a profligate man, any more than I am an improper woman. He has\r\nan unfortunate manner, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t try to make people like him if they\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t wish to do it of their own accord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThomasin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright quietly, fixing her eye upon her niece,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdo you think you deceive me in your defence of Mr. Wildeve?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have long had a suspicion that your love for him has changed its\r\ncolour since you have found him not to be the saint you thought him,\r\nand that you act a part to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wished to marry me, and I wish to marry him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I put it to you: would you at this present moment agree to be his\r\nwife if that had not happened to entangle you with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThomasin looked into the tree and appeared much disturbed. \xe2\x80\x9cAunt,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid presently, \xe2\x80\x9cI have, I think, a right to refuse to answer that\r\nquestion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may think what you choose. I have never implied to you by word or\r\ndeed that I have grown to think otherwise of him, and I never will. And\r\nI shall marry him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, wait till he repeats his offer. I think he may do it, now that\r\nhe knows\xe2\x80\x94something I told him. I don\xe2\x80\x99t for a moment dispute that it is\r\nthe most proper thing for you to marry him. Much as I have objected to\r\nhim in bygone days, I agree with you now, you may be sure. It is the\r\nonly way out of a false position, and a very galling one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you tell him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat he was standing in the way of another lover of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomasin, with round eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat _do_ you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed; it was my duty. I can say no more about it now, but\r\nwhen it is over I will tell you exactly what I said, and why I said\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThomasin was perforce content.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will keep the secret of my would-be marriage from Clym for the\r\npresent?\xe2\x80\x9d she next asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have given my word to. But what is the use of it? He must soon know\r\nwhat has happened. A mere look at your face will show him that\r\nsomething is wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThomasin turned and regarded her aunt from the tree. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, hearken to\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, her delicate voice expanding into firmness by a force\r\nwhich was other than physical. \xe2\x80\x9cTell him nothing. If he finds out that\r\nI am not worthy to be his cousin, let him. But, since he loved me once,\r\nwe will not pain him by telling him my trouble too soon. The air is\r\nfull of the story, I know; but gossips will not dare to speak of it to\r\nhim for the first few days. His closeness to me is the very thing that\r\nwill hinder the tale from reaching him early. If I am not made safe\r\nfrom sneers in a week or two I will tell him myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe earnestness with which Thomasin spoke prevented further objections.\r\nHer aunt simply said, \xe2\x80\x9cVery well. He should by rights have been told at\r\nthe time that the wedding was going to be. He will never forgive you\r\nfor your secrecy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he will, when he knows it was because I wished to spare him, and\r\nthat I did not expect him home so soon. And you must not let me stand\r\nin the way of your Christmas party. Putting it off would only make\r\nmatters worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I shall not. I do not wish to show myself beaten before all\r\nEgdon, and the sport of a man like Wildeve. We have enough berries now,\r\nI think, and we had better take them home. By the time we have decked\r\nthe house with this and hung up the mistletoe, we must think of\r\nstarting to meet him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThomasin came out of the tree, shook from her hair and dress the loose\r\nberries which had fallen thereon, and went down the hill with her aunt,\r\neach woman bearing half the gathered boughs. It was now nearly four\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, and the sunlight was leaving the vales. When the west grew red\r\nthe two relatives came again from the house and plunged into the heath\r\nin a different direction from the first, towards a point in the distant\r\nhighway along which the expected man was to return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nHow a Little Sound Produced a Great Dream\r\n\r\n\r\nEustacia stood just within the heath, straining her eyes in the\r\ndirection of Mrs. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s house and premises. No light, sound, or\r\nmovement was perceptible there. The evening was chilly; the spot was\r\ndark and lonely. She inferred that the guest had not yet come; and\r\nafter lingering ten or fifteen minutes she turned again towards home.\r\n\r\nShe had not far retraced her steps when sounds in front of her\r\nbetokened the approach of persons in conversation along the same path.\r\nSoon their heads became visible against the sky. They were walking\r\nslowly; and though it was too dark for much discovery of character from\r\naspect, the gait of them showed that they were not workers on the\r\nheath. Eustacia stepped a little out of the foot-track to let them\r\npass. They were two women and a man; and the voices of the women were\r\nthose of Mrs. Yeobright and Thomasin.\r\n\r\nThey went by her, and at the moment of passing appeared to discern her\r\ndusky form. There came to her ears in a masculine voice, \xe2\x80\x9cGood night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe murmured a reply, glided by them, and turned round. She could not,\r\nfor a moment, believe that chance, unrequested, had brought into her\r\npresence the soul of the house she had gone to inspect, the man without\r\nwhom her inspection would not have been thought of.\r\n\r\nShe strained her eyes to see them, but was unable. Such was her\r\nintentness, however, that it seemed as if her ears were performing the\r\nfunctions of seeing as well as hearing. This extension of power can\r\nalmost be believed in at such moments. The deaf Dr. Kitto was probably\r\nunder the influence of a parallel fancy when he described his body as\r\nhaving become, by long endeavour, so sensitive to vibrations that he\r\nhad gained the power of perceiving by it as by ears.\r\n\r\nShe could follow every word that the ramblers uttered. They were\r\ntalking no secrets. They were merely indulging in the ordinary\r\nvivacious chat of relatives who have long been parted in person though\r\nnot in soul. But it was not to the words that Eustacia listened; she\r\ncould not even have recalled, a few minutes later, what the words were.\r\nIt was to the alternating voice that gave out about one-tenth of\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94the voice that had wished her good night. Sometimes this throat\r\nuttered Yes, sometimes it uttered No; sometimes it made inquiries about\r\na time-worn denizen of the place. Once it surprised her notions by\r\nremarking upon the friendliness and geniality written in the faces of\r\nthe hills around.\r\n\r\nThe three voices passed on, and decayed and died out upon her ear. Thus\r\nmuch had been granted her; and all besides withheld. No event could\r\nhave been more exciting. During the greater part of the afternoon she\r\nhad been entrancing herself by imagining the fascination which must\r\nattend a man come direct from beautiful Paris\xe2\x80\x94laden with its\r\natmosphere, familiar with its charms. And this man had greeted her.\r\n\r\nWith the departure of the figures the profuse articulations of the\r\nwomen wasted away from her memory; but the accents of the other stayed\r\non. Was there anything in the voice of Mrs. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s son\xe2\x80\x94for Clym it\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94startling as a sound? No; it was simply comprehensive. All\r\nemotional things were possible to the speaker of that \xe2\x80\x9cgood night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nEustacia\xe2\x80\x99s imagination supplied the rest\xe2\x80\x94except the solution to one\r\nriddle. What _could_ the tastes of that man be who saw friendliness and\r\ngeniality in these shaggy hills?\r\n\r\nOn such occasions as this a thousand ideas pass through a highly\r\ncharged woman\xe2\x80\x99s head; and they indicate themselves on her face; but the\r\nchanges, though actual, are minute. Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s features went through a\r\nrhythmical succession of them. She glowed; remembering the mendacity of\r\nthe imagination, she flagged; then she freshened; then she fired; then\r\nshe cooled again. It was a cycle of aspects, produced by a cycle of\r\nvisions.\r\n\r\nEustacia entered her own house; she was excited. Her grandfather was\r\nenjoying himself over the fire, raking about the ashes and exposing the\r\nred-hot surface of the turves, so that their lurid glare irradiated the\r\nchimney-corner with the hues of a furnace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it that we are never friendly with the Yeobrights?\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\ncoming forward and stretching her soft hands over the warmth. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish\r\nwe were. They seem to be very nice people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe hanged if I know why,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cI liked the old man well\r\nenough, though he was as rough as a hedge. But you would never have\r\ncared to go there, even if you might have, I am well sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour town tastes would find them far too countrified. They sit in the\r\nkitchen, drink mead and elder-wine, and sand the floor to keep it\r\nclean. A sensible way of life; but how would you like it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought Mrs. Yeobright was a ladylike woman? A curate\xe2\x80\x99s daughter,\r\nwas she not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but she was obliged to live as her husband did; and I suppose she\r\nhas taken kindly to it by this time. Ah, I recollect that I once\r\naccidentally offended her, and I have never seen her since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat night was an eventful one to Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s brain, and one which she\r\nhardly ever forgot. She dreamt a dream; and few human beings, from\r\nNebuchadnezzar to the Swaffham tinker, ever dreamt a more remarkable\r\none. Such an elaborately developed, perplexing, exciting dream was\r\ncertainly never dreamed by a girl in Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s situation before. It\r\nhad as many ramifications as the Cretan labyrinth, as many fluctuations\r\nas the northern lights, as much colour as a parterre in June, and was\r\nas crowded with figures as a coronation. To Queen Scheherazade the\r\ndream might have seemed not far removed from commonplace; and to a girl\r\njust returned from all the courts of Europe it might have seemed not\r\nmore than interesting. But amid the circumstances of Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s life it\r\nwas as wonderful as a dream could be.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, gradually evolved from its transformation scenes a\r\nless extravagant episode, in which the heath dimly appeared behind the\r\ngeneral brilliancy of the action. She was dancing to wondrous music,\r\nand her partner was the man in silver armour who had accompanied her\r\nthrough the previous fantastic changes, the visor of his helmet being\r\nclosed. The mazes of the dance were ecstatic. Soft whispering came into\r\nher ear from under the radiant helmet, and she felt like a woman in\r\nParadise. Suddenly these two wheeled out from the mass of dancers,\r\ndived into one of the pools of the heath, and came out somewhere into\r\nan iridescent hollow, arched with rainbows. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nvoice by her side, and blushingly looking up she saw him removing his\r\ncasque to kiss her. At that moment there was a cracking noise, and his\r\nfigure fell into fragments like a pack of cards.\r\n\r\nShe cried aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cO that I had seen his face!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEustacia awoke. The cracking had been that of the window shutter\r\ndownstairs, which the maid-servant was opening to let in the day, now\r\nslowly increasing to Nature\xe2\x80\x99s meagre allowance at this sickly time of\r\nthe year. \xe2\x80\x9cO that I had seen his face!\xe2\x80\x9d she said again. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas meant\r\nfor Mr. Yeobright!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she became cooler she perceived that many of the phases of the\r\ndream had naturally arisen out of the images and fancies of the day\r\nbefore. But this detracted little from its interest, which lay in the\r\nexcellent fuel it provided for newly kindled fervour. She was at the\r\nmodulating point between indifference and love, at the stage called\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chaving a fancy for.\xe2\x80\x9d It occurs once in the history of the most\r\ngigantic passions, and it is a period when they are in the hands of the\r\nweakest will.\r\n\r\nThe perfervid woman was by this time half in love with a vision. The\r\nfantastic nature of her passion, which lowered her as an intellect,\r\nraised her as a soul. If she had had a little more self-control she\r\nwould have attenuated the emotion to nothing by sheer reasoning, and so\r\nhave killed it off. If she had had a little less pride she might have\r\ngone and circumambulated the Yeobrights\xe2\x80\x99 premises at Blooms-End at any\r\nmaidenly sacrifice until she had seen him. But Eustacia did neither of\r\nthese things. She acted as the most exemplary might have acted, being\r\nso influenced; she took an airing twice or thrice a day upon the Egdon\r\nhills, and kept her eyes employed.\r\n\r\nThe first occasion passed, and he did not come that way.\r\n\r\nShe promenaded a second time, and was again the sole wanderer there.\r\n\r\nThe third time there was a dense fog; she looked around, but without\r\nmuch hope. Even if he had been walking within twenty yards of her she\r\ncould not have seen him.\r\n\r\nAt the fourth attempt to encounter him it began to rain in torrents,\r\nand she turned back.\r\n\r\nThe fifth sally was in the afternoon; it was fine, and she remained out\r\nlong, walking to the very top of the valley in which Blooms-End lay.\r\nShe saw the white paling about half a mile off; but he did not appear.\r\nIt was almost with heart-sickness that she came home and with a sense\r\nof shame at her weakness. She resolved to look for the man from Paris\r\nno more.\r\n\r\nBut Providence is nothing if not coquettish; and no sooner had Eustacia\r\nformed this resolve than the opportunity came which, while sought, had\r\nbeen entirely withholden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nEustacia Is Led on to an Adventure\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the evening of this last day of expectation, which was the\r\ntwenty-third of December, Eustacia was at home alone. She had passed\r\nthe recent hour in lamenting over a rumour newly come to her ears\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nYeobright\xe2\x80\x99s visit to his mother was to be of short duration, and would\r\nend some time the next week. \xe2\x80\x9cNaturally,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself. A man in\r\nthe full swing of his activities in a gay city could not afford to\r\nlinger long on Egdon Heath. That she would behold face to face the\r\nowner of the awakening voice within the limits of such a holiday was\r\nmost unlikely, unless she were to haunt the environs of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse like a robin, to do which was difficult and unseemly.\r\n\r\nThe customary expedient of provincial girls and men in such\r\ncircumstances is churchgoing. In an ordinary village or country town\r\none can safely calculate that, either on Christmas day or the Sunday\r\ncontiguous, any native home for the holidays, who has not through age\r\nor ennui lost the appetite for seeing and being seen, will turn up in\r\nsome pew or other, shining with hope, self-consciousness, and new\r\nclothes. Thus the congregation on Christmas morning is mostly a Tussaud\r\ncollection of celebrities who have been born in the neighbourhood.\r\nHither the mistress, left neglected at home all the year, can steal and\r\nobserve the development of the returned lover who has forgotten her,\r\nand think as she watches him over her prayer book that he may throb\r\nwith a renewed fidelity when novelties have lost their charm. And\r\nhither a comparatively recent settler like Eustacia may betake herself\r\nto scrutinize the person of a native son who left home before her\r\nadvent upon the scene, and consider if the friendship of his parents be\r\nworth cultivating during his next absence in order to secure a\r\nknowledge of him on his next return.\r\n\r\nBut these tender schemes were not feasible among the scattered\r\ninhabitants of Egdon Heath. In name they were parishioners, but\r\nvirtually they belonged to no parish at all. People who came to these\r\nfew isolated houses to keep Christmas with their friends remained in\r\ntheir friends\xe2\x80\x99 chimney-corners drinking mead and other comforting\r\nliquors till they left again for good and all. Rain, snow, ice, mud\r\neverywhere around, they did not care to trudge two or three miles to\r\nsit wet-footed and splashed to the nape of their necks among those who,\r\nthough in some measure neighbours, lived close to the church, and\r\nentered it clean and dry. Eustacia knew it was ten to one that Clym\r\nYeobright would go to no church at all during his few days of leave,\r\nand that it would be a waste of labour for her to go driving the pony\r\nand gig over a bad road in hope to see him there.\r\n\r\nIt was dusk, and she was sitting by the fire in the dining-room or\r\nhall, which they occupied at this time of the year in preference to the\r\nparlour, because of its large hearth, constructed for turf-fires, a\r\nfuel the captain was partial to in the winter season. The only visible\r\narticles in the room were those on the window-sill, which showed their\r\nshapes against the low sky, the middle article being the old hourglass,\r\nand the other two a pair of ancient British urns which had been dug\r\nfrom a barrow near, and were used as flowerpots for two razor-leaved\r\ncactuses. Somebody knocked at the door. The servant was out; so was her\r\ngrandfather. The person, after waiting a minute, came in and tapped at\r\nthe door of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, Cap\xe2\x80\x99n Vye, will you let us\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEustacia arose and went to the door. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot allow you to come in so\r\nboldly. You should have waited.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cap\xe2\x80\x99n said I might come in without any fuss,\xe2\x80\x9d was answered in a\r\nlad\xe2\x80\x99s pleasant voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, did he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia more gently. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want, Charley?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease will your grandfather lend us his fuelhouse to try over our\r\nparts in, tonight at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, are you one of the Egdon mummers for this year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, miss. The cap\xe2\x80\x99n used to let the old mummers practise here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it. Yes, you may use the fuelhouse if you like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia\r\nlanguidly.\r\n\r\nThe choice of Captain Vye\xe2\x80\x99s fuelhouse as the scene of rehearsal was\r\ndictated by the fact that his dwelling was nearly in the centre of the\r\nheath. The fuelhouse was as roomy as a barn, and was a most desirable\r\nplace for such a purpose. The lads who formed the company of players\r\nlived at different scattered points around, and by meeting in this spot\r\nthe distances to be traversed by all the comers would be about equally\r\nproportioned.\r\n\r\nFor mummers and mumming Eustacia had the greatest contempt. The mummers\r\nthemselves were not afflicted with any such feeling for their art,\r\nthough at the same time they were not enthusiastic. A traditional\r\npastime is to be distinguished from a mere revival in no more striking\r\nfeature than in this, that while in the revival all is excitement and\r\nfervour, the survival is carried on with a stolidity and absence of\r\nstir which sets one wondering why a thing that is done so perfunctorily\r\nshould be kept up at all. Like Balaam and other unwilling prophets, the\r\nagents seem moved by an inner compulsion to say and do their allotted\r\nparts whether they will or no. This unweeting manner of performance is\r\nthe true ring by which, in this refurbishing age, a fossilized survival\r\nmay be known from a spurious reproduction.\r\n\r\nThe piece was the well-known play of Saint George, and all who were\r\nbehind the scenes assisted in the preparations, including the women of\r\neach household. Without the co-operation of sisters and sweethearts the\r\ndresses were likely to be a failure; but on the other hand, this class\r\nof assistance was not without its drawbacks. The girls could never be\r\nbrought to respect tradition in designing and decorating the armour;\r\nthey insisted on attaching loops and bows of silk and velvet in any\r\nsituation pleasing to their taste. Gorget, gusset, basinet, cuirass,\r\ngauntlet, sleeve, all alike in the view of these feminine eyes were\r\npracticable spaces whereon to sew scraps of fluttering colour.\r\n\r\nIt might be that Joe, who fought on the side of Christendom, had a\r\nsweetheart, and that Jim, who fought on the side of the Moslem, had one\r\nlikewise. During the making of the costumes it would come to the\r\nknowledge of Joe\xe2\x80\x99s sweetheart that Jim\xe2\x80\x99s was putting brilliant silk\r\nscallops at the bottom of her lover\xe2\x80\x99s surcoat, in addition to the\r\nribbons of the visor, the bars of which, being invariably formed of\r\ncoloured strips about half an inch wide hanging before the face, were\r\nmostly of that material. Joe\xe2\x80\x99s sweetheart straight-way placed brilliant\r\nsilk on the scallops of the hem in question, and, going a little\r\nfurther, added ribbon tufts to the shoulder pieces. Jim\xe2\x80\x99s, not to be\r\noutdone, would affix bows and rosettes everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe result was that in the end the Valiant Soldier, of the Christian\r\narmy, was distinguished by no peculiarity of accoutrement from the\r\nTurkish Knight; and what was worse, on a casual view Saint George\r\nhimself might be mistaken for his deadly enemy, the Saracen. The\r\nguisers themselves, though inwardly regretting this confusion of\r\npersons, could not afford to offend those by whose assistance they so\r\nlargely profited, and the innovations were allowed to stand.\r\n\r\nThere was, it is true, a limit to this tendency to uniformity. The\r\nLeech or Doctor preserved his character intact\xe2\x80\x94his darker habiliments,\r\npeculiar hat, and the bottle of physic slung under his arm, could never\r\nbe mistaken. And the same might be said of the conventional figure of\r\nFather Christmas, with his gigantic club, an older man, who accompanied\r\nthe band as general protector in long night journeys from parish to\r\nparish, and was bearer of the purse.\r\n\r\nSeven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the hour of the rehearsal, came round, and in a short\r\ntime Eustacia could hear voices in the fuelhouse. To dissipate in some\r\ntrifling measure her abiding sense of the murkiness of human life she\r\nwent to the \xe2\x80\x9clinhay\xe2\x80\x9d or lean-to shed, which formed the root-store of\r\ntheir dwelling and abutted on the fuelhouse. Here was a small rough\r\nhole in the mud wall, originally made for pigeons, through which the\r\ninterior of the next shed could be viewed. A light came from it now;\r\nand Eustacia stepped upon a stool to look in upon the scene.\r\n\r\nOn a ledge in the fuelhouse stood three tall rushlights and by the\r\nlight of them seven or eight lads were marching about, haranguing, and\r\nconfusing each other, in endeavours to perfect themselves in the play.\r\nHumphrey and Sam, the furze- and turf-cutters, were there looking on,\r\nso also was Timothy Fairway, who leant against the wall and prompted\r\nthe boys from memory, interspersing among the set words remarks and\r\nanecdotes of the superior days when he and others were the Egdon\r\nmummers-elect that these lads were now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, ye be as well up to it as ever ye will be,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNot that\r\nsuch mumming would have passed in our time. Harry as the Saracen should\r\nstrut a bit more, and John needn\xe2\x80\x99t holler his inside out. Beyond that\r\nperhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll do. Have you got all your clothes ready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall by Monday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour first outing will be Monday night, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. At Mrs. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mrs. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s. What makes her want to see ye? I should think a\r\nmiddle-aged woman was tired of mumming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s got up a bit of a party, because \xe2\x80\x99tis the first Christmas that\r\nher son Clym has been home for a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, to be sure\xe2\x80\x94her party! I am going myself. I almost forgot\r\nit, upon my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEustacia\xe2\x80\x99s face flagged. There was to be a party at the Yeobrights\xe2\x80\x99;\r\nshe, naturally, had nothing to do with it. She was a stranger to all\r\nsuch local gatherings, and had always held them as scarcely\r\nappertaining to her sphere. But had she been going, what an opportunity\r\nwould have been afforded her of seeing the man whose influence was\r\npenetrating her like summer sun! To increase that influence was coveted\r\nexcitement; to cast it off might be to regain serenity; to leave it as\r\nit stood was tantalizing.\r\n\r\nThe lads and men prepared to leave the premises, and Eustacia returned\r\nto her fireside. She was immersed in thought, but not for long. In a\r\nfew minutes the lad Charley, who had come to ask permission to use the\r\nplace, returned with the key to the kitchen. Eustacia heard him, and\r\nopening the door into the passage said, \xe2\x80\x9cCharley, come here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lad was surprised. He entered the front room not without blushing;\r\nfor he, like many, had felt the power of this girl\xe2\x80\x99s face and form.\r\n\r\nShe pointed to a seat by the fire, and entered the other side of the\r\nchimney-corner herself. It could be seen in her face that whatever\r\nmotive she might have had in asking the youth indoors would soon\r\nappear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich part do you play, Charley\xe2\x80\x94the Turkish Knight, do you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninquired the beauty, looking across the smoke of the fire to him on the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, miss, the Turkish Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied diffidently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs yours a long part?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNine speeches, about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you repeat them to me? If so I should like to hear them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lad smiled into the glowing turf and began\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere come I, a Turkish Knight,\r\nWho learnt in Turkish land to fight,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\ncontinuing the discourse throughout the scenes to the concluding\r\ncatastrophe of his fall by the hand of Saint George.\r\n\r\nEustacia had occasionally heard the part recited before. When the lad\r\nended she began, precisely in the same words, and ranted on without\r\nhitch or divergence till she too reached the end. It was the same\r\nthing, yet how different. Like in form, it had the added softness and\r\nfinish of a Raffaelle after Perugino, which, while faithfully\r\nreproducing the original subject, entirely distances the original art.\r\n\r\nCharley\xe2\x80\x99s eyes rounded with surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you be a clever lady!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, in admiration. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been three weeks learning mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard it before,\xe2\x80\x9d she quietly observed. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, would you do\r\nanything to please me, Charley?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d do a good deal, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you let me play your part for one night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, miss! But your woman\xe2\x80\x99s gown\xe2\x80\x94you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can get boy\xe2\x80\x99s clothes\xe2\x80\x94at least all that would be wanted besides the\r\nmumming dress. What should I have to give you to lend me your things,\r\nto let me take your place for an hour or two on Monday night, and on no\r\naccount to say a word about who or what I am? You would, of course,\r\nhave to excuse yourself from playing that night, and to say that\r\nsomebody\xe2\x80\x94a cousin of Miss Vye\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94would act for you. The other mummers\r\nhave never spoken to me in their lives so that it would be safe enough;\r\nand if it were not, I should not mind. Now, what must I give you to\r\nagree to this? Half a crown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth shook his head\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive shillings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head again. \xe2\x80\x9cMoney won\xe2\x80\x99t do it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, brushing the\r\niron head of the firedog with the hollow of his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will, then, Charley?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia in a disappointed tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what you forbade me at the Maypoling, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the\r\nlad, without looking at her, and still stroking the firedog\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia, with a little more hauteur. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wanted to join\r\nhands with me in the ring, if I recollect?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf an hour of that, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll agree, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEustacia regarded the youth steadfastly. He was three years younger\r\nthan herself, but apparently not backward for his age. \xe2\x80\x9cHalf an hour of\r\nwhat?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, though she guessed what.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHolding your hand in mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was silent. \xe2\x80\x9cMake it a quarter of an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss Eustacia\xe2\x80\x94I will, if I may kiss it too. A quarter of an hour.\r\nAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll swear to do the best I can to let you take my place without\r\nanybody knowing. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think somebody might know your tongue,\r\nmiss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is possible. But I will put a pebble in my mouth to make is less\r\nlikely. Very well; you shall be allowed to have my hand as soon as you\r\nbring the dress and your sword and staff. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you any longer\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharley departed, and Eustacia felt more and more interest in life.\r\nHere was something to do: here was some one to see, and a charmingly\r\nadventurous way to see him. \xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cwant of an\r\nobject to live for\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all is the matter with me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEustacia\xe2\x80\x99s manner was as a rule of a slumberous sort, her passions\r\nbeing of the massive rather than the vivacious kind. But when aroused\r\nshe would make a dash which, just for the time, was not unlike the move\r\nof a naturally lively person.\r\n\r\nOn the question of recognition she was somewhat indifferent. By the\r\nacting lads themselves she was not likely to be known. With the guests\r\nwho might be assembled she was hardly so secure. Yet detection, after\r\nall, would be no such dreadful thing. The fact only could be detected,\r\nher true motive never. It would be instantly set down as the passing\r\nfreak of a girl whose ways were already considered singular. That she\r\nwas doing for an earnest reason what would most naturally be done in\r\njest was at any rate a safe secret.\r\n\r\nThe next evening Eustacia stood punctually at the fuelhouse door,\r\nwaiting for the dusk which was to bring Charley with the trappings. Her\r\ngrandfather was at home tonight, and she would be unable to ask her\r\nconfederate indoors.\r\n\r\nHe appeared on the dark ridge of heathland, like a fly on a Negro,\r\nbearing the articles with him, and came up breathless with his walk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere are the things,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, placing them upon the threshold.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Miss Eustacia\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe payment. It is quite ready. I am as good as my word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe leant against the door-post, and gave him her hand. Charley took it\r\nin both his own with a tenderness beyond description, unless it was\r\nlike that of a child holding a captured sparrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there\xe2\x80\x99s a glove on it!\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a deprecating way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been walking,\xe2\x80\x9d she observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, miss!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94it is hardly fair.\xe2\x80\x9d She pulled off the glove, and gave him her\r\nbare hand.\r\n\r\nThey stood together minute after minute, without further speech, each\r\nlooking at the blackening scene, and each thinking his and her own\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I won\xe2\x80\x99t use it all up tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charley devotedly, when\r\nsix or eight minutes had been passed by him caressing her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I\r\nhave the other few minutes another time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you like,\xe2\x80\x9d said she without the least emotion. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it must be over\r\nin a week. Now, there is only one thing I want you to do\xe2\x80\x94to wait while\r\nI put on the dress, and then to see if I do my part properly. But let\r\nme look first indoors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe vanished for a minute or two, and went in. Her grandfather was\r\nsafely asleep in his chair. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, then,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, on returning, \xe2\x80\x9cwalk\r\ndown the garden a little way, and when I am ready I\xe2\x80\x99ll call you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharley walked and waited, and presently heard a soft whistle. He\r\nreturned to the fuelhouse door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you whistle, Miss Vye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; come in,\xe2\x80\x9d reached him in Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s voice from a back quarter. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmust not strike a light till the door is shut, or it may be seen\r\nshining. Push your hat into the hole through to the wash-house, if you\r\ncan feel your way across.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharley did as commanded, and she struck the light revealing herself to\r\nbe changed in sex, brilliant in colours, and armed from top to toe.\r\nPerhaps she quailed a little under Charley\xe2\x80\x99s vigorous gaze, but whether\r\nany shyness at her male attire appeared upon her countenance could not\r\nbe seen by reason of the strips of ribbon which used to cover the face\r\nin mumming costumes, representing the barred visor of the medi\xc3\xa6val\r\nhelmet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt fits pretty well,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking down at the white overalls,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cexcept that the tunic, or whatever you call it, is long in the sleeve.\r\nThe bottom of the overalls I can turn up inside. Now pay attention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEustacia then proceeded in her delivery, striking the sword against the\r\nstaff or lance at the minatory phrases, in the orthodox mumming manner,\r\nand strutting up and down. Charley seasoned his admiration with\r\ncriticism of the gentlest kind, for the touch of Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s hand yet\r\nremained with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now for your excuse to the others,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you meet\r\nbefore you go to Mrs. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe thought of meeting here, miss, if you have nothing to say against\r\nit. At eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, so as to get there by nine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Well, you of course must not appear. I will march in about five\r\nminutes late, ready-dressed, and tell them that you can\xe2\x80\x99t come. I have\r\ndecided that the best plan will be for you to be sent somewhere by me,\r\nto make a real thing of the excuse. Our two heath-croppers are in the\r\nhabit of straying into the meads, and tomorrow evening you can go and\r\nsee if they are gone there. I\xe2\x80\x99ll manage the rest. Now you may leave\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, miss. But I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll have one minute more of what I am owed, if\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEustacia gave him her hand as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne minute,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and counted on till she reached seven or eight\r\nminutes. Hand and person she then withdrew to a distance of several\r\nfeet, and recovered some of her old dignity. The contract completed,\r\nshe raised between them a barrier impenetrable as a wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, \xe2\x80\x99tis all gone; and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean quite all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a\r\nsigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had good measure,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, turning away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, miss. Well, \xe2\x80\x99tis over, and now I\xe2\x80\x99ll get home-along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\nThrough the Moonlight\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next evening the mummers were assembled in the same spot, awaiting\r\nthe entrance of the Turkish Knight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty minutes after eight by the Quiet Woman, and Charley not come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen minutes past by Blooms-End.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wants ten minutes to, by Grandfer Cantle\xe2\x80\x99s watch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd \xe2\x80\x99tis five minutes past by the captain\xe2\x80\x99s clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn Egdon there was no absolute hour of the day. The time at any moment\r\nwas a number of varying doctrines professed by the different hamlets,\r\nsome of them having originally grown up from a common root, and then\r\nbecome divided by secession, some having been alien from the beginning.\r\nWest Egdon believed in Blooms-End time, East Egdon in the time of the\r\nQuiet Woman Inn. Grandfer Cantle\xe2\x80\x99s watch had numbered many followers in\r\nyears gone by, but since he had grown older faiths were shaken. Thus,\r\nthe mummers having gathered hither from scattered points each came with\r\nhis own tenets on early and late; and they waited a little longer as a\r\ncompromise.\r\n\r\nEustacia had watched the assemblage through the hole; and seeing that\r\nnow was the proper moment to enter, she went from the \xe2\x80\x9clinhay\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nboldly pulled the bobbin of the fuelhouse door. Her grandfather was\r\nsafe at the Quiet Woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s Charley at last! How late you be, Charley.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis not Charley,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Turkish Knight from within his visor.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a cousin of Miss Vye\xe2\x80\x99s, come to take Charley\xe2\x80\x99s place from\r\ncuriosity. He was obliged to go and look for the heath-croppers that\r\nhave got into the meads, and I agreed to take his place, as he knew he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come back here again tonight. I know the part as well as he.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer graceful gait, elegant figure, and dignified manner in general won\r\nthe mummers to the opinion that they had gained by the exchange, if the\r\nnewcomer were perfect in his part.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt don\xe2\x80\x99t matter\xe2\x80\x94if you be not too young,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saint George.\r\nEustacia\xe2\x80\x99s voice had sounded somewhat more juvenile and fluty than\r\nCharley\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know every word of it, I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia decisively. Dash\r\nbeing all that was required to carry her triumphantly through, she\r\nadopted as much as was necessary. \xe2\x80\x9cGo ahead, lads, with the try-over.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll challenge any of you to find a mistake in me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe play was hastily rehearsed, whereupon the other mummers were\r\ndelighted with the new knight. They extinguished the candles at\r\nhalf-past eight, and set out upon the heath in the direction of Mrs.\r\nYeobright\xe2\x80\x99s house at Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s-End.\r\n\r\nThere was a slight hoarfrost that night, and the moon, though not more\r\nthan half full, threw a spirited and enticing brightness upon the\r\nfantastic figures of the mumming band, whose plumes and ribbons rustled\r\nin their walk like autumn leaves. Their path was not over Rainbarrow\r\nnow, but down a valley which left that ancient elevation a little to\r\nthe east. The bottom of the vale was green to a width of ten yards or\r\nthereabouts, and the shining facets of frost upon the blades of grass\r\nseemed to move on with the shadows of those they surrounded. The masses\r\nof furze and heath to the right and left were dark as ever; a mere\r\nhalf-moon was powerless to silver such sable features as theirs.\r\n\r\nHalf-an-hour of walking and talking brought them to the spot in the\r\nvalley where the grass riband widened and led down to the front of the\r\nhouse. At sight of the place Eustacia who had felt a few passing doubts\r\nduring her walk with the youths, again was glad that the adventure had\r\nbeen undertaken. She had come out to see a man who might possibly have\r\nthe power to deliver her soul from a most deadly oppression. What was\r\nWildeve? Interesting, but inadequate. Perhaps she would see a\r\nsufficient hero tonight.\r\n\r\nAs they drew nearer to the front of the house the mummers became aware\r\nthat music and dancing were briskly flourishing within. Every now and\r\nthen a long low note from the serpent, which was the chief wind\r\ninstrument played at these times, advanced further into the heath than\r\nthe thin treble part, and reached their ears alone; and next a more\r\nthan usual loud tread from a dancer would come the same way. With\r\nnearer approach these fragmentary sounds became pieced together, and\r\nwere found to be the salient points of the tune called \xe2\x80\x9cNancy\xe2\x80\x99s Fancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was there, of course. Who was she that he danced with? Perhaps some\r\nunknown woman, far beneath herself in culture, was by the most subtle\r\nof lures sealing his fate this very instant. To dance with a man is to\r\nconcentrate a twelvemonth\xe2\x80\x99s regulation fire upon him in the fragment of\r\nan hour. To pass to courtship without acquaintance, to pass to marriage\r\nwithout courtship, is a skipping of terms reserved for those alone who\r\ntread this royal road. She would see how his heart lay by keen\r\nobservation of them all.\r\n\r\nThe enterprising lady followed the mumming company through the gate in\r\nthe white paling, and stood before the open porch. The house was\r\nencrusted with heavy thatchings, which dropped between the upper\r\nwindows; the front, upon which the moonbeams directly played, had\r\noriginally been white; but a huge pyracanth now darkened the greater\r\nportion.\r\n\r\nIt became at once evident that the dance was proceeding immediately\r\nwithin the surface of the door, no apartment intervening. The brushing\r\nof skirts and elbows, sometimes the bumping of shoulders, could be\r\nheard against the very panels. Eustacia, though living within two miles\r\nof the place, had never seen the interior of this quaint old\r\nhabitation. Between Captain Vye and the Yeobrights there had never\r\nexisted much acquaintance, the former having come as a stranger and\r\npurchased the long-empty house at Mistover Knap not long before the\r\ndeath of Mrs. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s husband; and with that event and the\r\ndeparture of her son such friendship as had grown up became quite\r\nbroken off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there no passage inside the door, then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Eustacia as they\r\nstood within the porch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lad who played the Saracen. \xe2\x80\x9cThe door opens right upon\r\nthe front sitting-room, where the spree\xe2\x80\x99s going on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that we cannot open the door without stopping the dance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it. Here we must bide till they have done, for they always bolt\r\nthe back door after dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey won\xe2\x80\x99t be much longer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Father Christmas.\r\n\r\nThis assertion, however, was hardly borne out by the event. Again the\r\ninstruments ended the tune; again they recommenced with as much fire\r\nand pathos as if it were the first strain. The air was now that one\r\nwithout any particular beginning, middle, or end, which perhaps, among\r\nall the dances which throng an inspired fiddler\xe2\x80\x99s fancy, best conveys\r\nthe idea of the interminable\xe2\x80\x94the celebrated \xe2\x80\x9cDevil\xe2\x80\x99s Dream.\xe2\x80\x9d The fury\r\nof personal movement that was kindled by the fury of the notes could be\r\napproximately imagined by these outsiders under the moon, from the\r\noccasional kicks of toes and heels against the door, whenever the whirl\r\nround had been of more than customary velocity.\r\n\r\nThe first five minutes of listening was interesting enough to the\r\nmummers. The five minutes extended to ten minutes, and these to a\r\nquarter of an hour; but no signs of ceasing were audible in the lively\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDream.\xe2\x80\x9d The bumping against the door, the laughter, the stamping, were\r\nall as vigorous as ever, and the pleasure in being outside lessened\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy does Mrs. Yeobright give parties of this sort?\xe2\x80\x9d Eustacia asked, a\r\nlittle surprised to hear merriment so pronounced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not one of her bettermost parlour-parties. She\xe2\x80\x99s asked the plain\r\nneighbours and workpeople without drawing any lines, just to give \xe2\x80\x99em a\r\ngood supper and such like. Her son and she wait upon the folks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis the last strain, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saint George, with his ear to the\r\npanel. \xe2\x80\x9cA young man and woman have just swung into this corner, and\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s saying to her, \xe2\x80\x98Ah, the pity; \xe2\x80\x99tis over for us this time, my\r\nown.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Turkish Knight, stamping, and taking from the\r\nwall the conventional lance that each of the mummers carried. Her boots\r\nbeing thinner than those of the young men, the hoar had damped her feet\r\nand made them cold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my song \xe2\x80\x99tis another ten minutes for us,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Valiant\r\nSoldier, looking through the keyhole as the tune modulated into another\r\nwithout stopping. \xe2\x80\x9cGrandfer Cantle is standing in this corner, waiting\r\nhis turn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twon\xe2\x80\x99t be long; \xe2\x80\x99tis a six-handed reel,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not go in, dancing or no? They sent for us,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Saracen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia authoritatively, as she paced smartly up\r\nand down from door to gate to warm herself. \xe2\x80\x9cWe should burst into the\r\nmiddle of them and stop the dance, and that would be unmannerly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe thinks himself somebody because he has had a bit more schooling\r\nthan we,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may go to the deuce!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia.\r\n\r\nThere was a whispered conversation between three or four of them, and\r\none turned to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you tell us one thing?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, not without gentleness. \xe2\x80\x9cBe you\r\nMiss Vye? We think you must be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may think what you like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut honourable\r\nlads will not tell tales upon a lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll say nothing, miss. That\xe2\x80\x99s upon our honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the fiddles finished off with a screech, and the serpent\r\nemitted a last note that nearly lifted the roof. When, from the\r\ncomparative quiet within, the mummers judged that the dancers had taken\r\ntheir seats, Father Christmas advanced, lifted the latch, and put his\r\nhead inside the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the mummers, the mummers!\xe2\x80\x9d cried several guests at once. \xe2\x80\x9cClear a\r\nspace for the mummers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHumpbacked Father Christmas then made a complete entry, swinging his\r\nhuge club, and in a general way clearing the stage for the actors\r\nproper, while he informed the company in smart verse that he was come,\r\nwelcome or welcome not; concluding his speech with\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake room, make room, my gallant boys,\r\nAnd give us space to rhyme;\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve come to show Saint George\xe2\x80\x99s play,\r\nUpon this Christmas time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe guests were now arranging themselves at one end of the room, the\r\nfiddler was mending a string, the serpent-player was emptying his\r\nmouthpiece, and the play began. First of those outside the Valiant\r\nSoldier entered, in the interest of Saint George\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere come I, the Valiant Soldier;\r\nSlasher is my name\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\n\r\n\r\nand so on. This speech concluded with a challenge to the infidel, at\r\nthe end of which it was Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s duty to enter as the Turkish Knight.\r\nShe, with the rest who were not yet on, had hitherto remained in the\r\nmoonlight which streamed under the porch. With no apparent effort or\r\nbackwardness she came in, beginning\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere come I, a Turkish Knight,\r\nWho learnt in Turkish land to fight;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll fight this man with courage bold:\r\nIf his blood\xe2\x80\x99s hot I\xe2\x80\x99ll make it cold!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring her declamation Eustacia held her head erect, and spoke as\r\nroughly as she could, feeling pretty secure from observation. But the\r\nconcentration upon her part necessary to prevent discovery, the newness\r\nof the scene, the shine of the candles, and the confusing effect upon\r\nher vision of the ribboned visor which hid her features, left her\r\nabsolutely unable to perceive who were present as spectators. On the\r\nfurther side of a table bearing candles she could faintly discern\r\nfaces, and that was all.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Jim Starks as the Valiant Soldier had come forward, and, with\r\na glare upon the Turk, replied\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf, then, thou art that Turkish Knight,\r\nDraw out thy sword, and let us fight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd fight they did; the issue of the combat being that the Valiant\r\nSoldier was slain by a preternaturally inadequate thrust from Eustacia,\r\nJim, in his ardour for genuine histrionic art, coming down like a log\r\nupon the stone floor with force enough to dislocate his shoulder. Then,\r\nafter more words from the Turkish Knight, rather too faintly delivered,\r\nand statements that he\xe2\x80\x99d fight Saint George and all his crew, Saint\r\nGeorge himself magnificently entered with the well-known flourish\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere come I, Saint George, the valiant man,\r\nWith naked sword and spear in hand,\r\nWho fought the dragon and brought him to the slaughter,\r\nAnd by this won fair Sabra, the King of Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s daughter;\r\nWhat mortal man would dare to stand\r\nBefore me with my sword in hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the lad who had first recognized Eustacia; and when she now,\r\nas the Turk, replied with suitable defiance, and at once began the\r\ncombat, the young fellow took especial care to use his sword as gently\r\nas possible. Being wounded, the Knight fell upon one knee, according to\r\nthe direction. The Doctor now entered, restored the Knight by giving\r\nhim a draught from the bottle which he carried, and the fight was again\r\nresumed, the Turk sinking by degrees until quite overcome\xe2\x80\x94dying as hard\r\nin this venerable drama as he is said to do at the present day.\r\n\r\nThis gradual sinking to the earth was, in fact, one reason why Eustacia\r\nhad thought that the part of the Turkish Knight, though not the\r\nshortest, would suit her best. A direct fall from upright to\r\nhorizontal, which was the end of the other fighting characters, was not\r\nan elegant or decorous part for a girl. But it was easy to die like a\r\nTurk, by a dogged decline.\r\n\r\nEustacia was now among the number of the slain, though not on the\r\nfloor, for she had managed to sink into a sloping position against the\r\nclock-case, so that her head was well elevated. The play proceeded\r\nbetween Saint George, the Saracen, the Doctor, and Father Christmas;\r\nand Eustacia, having no more to do, for the first time found leisure to\r\nobserve the scene round, and to search for the form that had drawn her\r\nhither.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\nThe Two Stand Face to Face\r\n\r\n\r\nThe room had been arranged with a view to the dancing, the large oak\r\ntable having been moved back till it stood as a breastwork to the\r\nfireplace. At each end, behind, and in the chimney-corner were grouped\r\nthe guests, many of them being warm-faced and panting, among whom\r\nEustacia cursorily recognized some well-to-do persons from beyond the\r\nheath. Thomasin, as she had expected, was not visible, and Eustacia\r\nrecollected that a light had shone from an upper window when they were\r\noutside\xe2\x80\x94the window, probably, of Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s room. A nose, chin, hands,\r\nknees, and toes projected from the seat within the chimney opening,\r\nwhich members she found to unite in the person of Grandfer Cantle, Mrs.\r\nYeobright\xe2\x80\x99s occasional assistant in the garden, and therefore one of\r\nthe invited. The smoke went up from an Etna of peat in front of him,\r\nplayed round the notches of the chimney-crook, struck against the\r\nsalt-box, and got lost among the flitches.\r\n\r\nAnother part of the room soon riveted her gaze. At the other side of\r\nthe chimney stood the settle, which is the necessary supplement to a\r\nfire so open that nothing less than a strong breeze will carry up the\r\nsmoke. It is, to the hearths of old-fashioned cavernous fireplaces,\r\nwhat the east belt of trees is to the exposed country estate, or the\r\nnorth wall to the garden. Outside the settle candles gutter, locks of\r\nhair wave, young women shiver, and old men sneeze. Inside is Paradise.\r\nNot a symptom of a draught disturbs the air; the sitters\xe2\x80\x99 backs are as\r\nwarm as their faces, and songs and old tales are drawn from the\r\noccupants by the comfortable heat, like fruit from melon plants in a\r\nframe.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, not with those who sat in the settle that Eustacia was\r\nconcerned. A face showed itself with marked distinctness against the\r\ndark-tanned wood of the upper part. The owner, who was leaning against\r\nthe settle\xe2\x80\x99s outer end, was Clement Yeobright, or Clym, as he was\r\ncalled here; she knew it could be nobody else. The spectacle\r\nconstituted an area of two feet in Rembrandt\xe2\x80\x99s intensest manner. A\r\nstrange power in the lounger\xe2\x80\x99s appearance lay in the fact that, though\r\nhis whole figure was visible, the observer\xe2\x80\x99s eye was only aware of his\r\nface.\r\n\r\nTo one of middle age the countenance was that of a young man, though a\r\nyouth might hardly have seen any necessity for the term of immaturity.\r\nBut it was really one of those faces which convey less the idea of so\r\nmany years as its age than of so much experience as its store. The\r\nnumber of their years may have adequately summed up Jared, Mahalaleel,\r\nand the rest of the antediluvians, but the age of a modern man is to be\r\nmeasured by the intensity of his history.\r\n\r\nThe face was well shaped, even excellently. But the mind within was\r\nbeginning to use it as a mere waste tablet whereon to trace its\r\nidiosyncrasies as they developed themselves. The beauty here visible\r\nwould in no long time be ruthlessly over-run by its parasite, thought,\r\nwhich might just as well have fed upon a plainer exterior where there\r\nwas nothing it could harm. Had Heaven preserved Yeobright from a\r\nwearing habit of meditation, people would have said, \xe2\x80\x9cA handsome man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHad his brain unfolded under sharper contours they would have said, \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nthoughtful man.\xe2\x80\x9d But an inner strenuousness was preying upon an outer\r\nsymmetry, and they rated his look as singular.\r\n\r\nHence people who began by beholding him ended by perusing him. His\r\ncountenance was overlaid with legible meanings. Without being\r\nthought-worn he yet had certain marks derived from a perception of his\r\nsurroundings, such as are not unfrequently found on men at the end of\r\nthe four or five years of endeavour which follow the close of placid\r\npupilage. He already showed that thought is a disease of flesh, and\r\nindirectly bore evidence that ideal physical beauty is incompatible\r\nwith emotional development and a full recognition of the coil of\r\nthings. Mental luminousness must be fed with the oil of life, even\r\nthough there is already a physical need for it; and the pitiful sight\r\nof two demands on one supply was just showing itself here.\r\n\r\nWhen standing before certain men the philosopher regrets that thinkers\r\nare but perishable tissue, the artist that perishable tissue has to\r\nthink. Thus to deplore, each from his point of view, the mutually\r\ndestructive interdependence of spirit and flesh would have been\r\ninstinctive with these in critically observing Yeobright.\r\n\r\nAs for his look, it was a natural cheerfulness striving against\r\ndepression from without, and not quite succeeding. The look suggested\r\nisolation, but it revealed something more. As is usual with bright\r\nnatures, the deity that lies ignominiously chained within an ephemeral\r\nhuman carcase shone out of him like a ray.\r\n\r\nThe effect upon Eustacia was palpable. The extraordinary pitch of\r\nexcitement that she had reached beforehand would, indeed, have caused\r\nher to be influenced by the most commonplace man. She was troubled at\r\nYeobright\xe2\x80\x99s presence.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the play ended\xe2\x80\x94the Saracen\xe2\x80\x99s head was cut off, and\r\nSaint George stood as victor. Nobody commented, any more than they\r\nwould have commented on the fact of mushrooms coming in autumn or\r\nsnowdrops in spring. They took the piece as phlegmatically as did the\r\nactors themselves. It was a phase of cheerfulness which was, as a\r\nmatter of course, to be passed through every Christmas; and there was\r\nno more to be said.\r\n\r\nThey sang the plaintive chant which follows the play, during which all\r\nthe dead men rise to their feet in a silent and awful manner, like the\r\nghosts of Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s soldiers in the Midnight Review. Afterwards the\r\ndoor opened, and Fairway appeared on the threshold, accompanied by\r\nChristian and another. They had been waiting outside for the conclusion\r\nof the play, as the players had waited for the conclusion of the dance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, come in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright; and Clym went forward to\r\nwelcome them. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is it you are so late? Grandfer Cantle has been here\r\never so long, and we thought you\xe2\x80\x99d have come with him, as you live so\r\nnear one another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I should have come earlier,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Fairway said and paused to look\r\nalong the beam of the ceiling for a nail to hang his hat on; but,\r\nfinding his accustomed one to be occupied by the mistletoe, and all the\r\nnails in the walls to be burdened with bunches of holly, he at last\r\nrelieved himself of the hat by ticklishly balancing it between the\r\ncandle-box and the head of the clock-case. \xe2\x80\x9cI should have come earlier,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, with a more composed air, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I know what parties\r\nbe, and how there\xe2\x80\x99s none too much room in folks\xe2\x80\x99 houses at such times,\r\nso I thought I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come till you\xe2\x80\x99d got settled a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I thought so too, Mrs. Yeobright,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christian earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nFather there was so eager that he had no manners at all, and left home\r\nalmost afore \xe2\x80\x99twas dark. I told him \xe2\x80\x99twas barely decent in a\xe2\x80\x99 old man\r\nto come so oversoon; but words be wind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKlk! I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to bide waiting about, till half the game was\r\nover! I\xe2\x80\x99m as light as a kite when anything\xe2\x80\x99s going on!\xe2\x80\x9d crowed Grandfer\r\nCantle from the chimneyseat.\r\n\r\nFairway had meanwhile concluded a critical gaze at Yeobright. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, you\r\nmay not believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the rest of the room, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I should\r\nnever have knowed this gentleman if I had met him anywhere off his own\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99th\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s altered so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou too have altered, and for the better, I think Timothy,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nYeobright, surveying the firm figure of Fairway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster Yeobright, look me over too. I have altered for the better,\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t I, hey?\xe2\x80\x9d said Grandfer Cantle, rising and placing himself\r\nsomething above half a foot from Clym\xe2\x80\x99s eye, to induce the most\r\nsearching criticism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure we will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway, taking the candle and moving it\r\nover the surface of the Grandfer\xe2\x80\x99s countenance, the subject of his\r\nscrutiny irradiating himself with light and pleasant smiles, and giving\r\nhimself jerks of juvenility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yeobright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there\xe2\x80\x99s any difference, Grandfer is younger,\xe2\x80\x9d appended Fairway\r\ndecisively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet not my own doing, and I feel no pride in it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the pleased\r\nancient. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t be cured of my vagaries; them I plead guilty to.\r\nYes, Master Cantle always was that, as we know. But I am nothing by the\r\nside of you, Mister Clym.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor any o\xe2\x80\x99 us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Humphrey, in a low rich tone of admiration, not\r\nintended to reach anybody\xe2\x80\x99s ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, there would have been nobody here who could have stood as\r\ndecent second to him, or even third, if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been a soldier in the\r\nBang-up Locals (as we was called for our smartness),\xe2\x80\x9d said Grandfer\r\nCantle. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd even as \xe2\x80\x99tis we all look a little scammish beside him. But\r\nin the year four \xe2\x80\x99twas said there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a finer figure in the whole\r\nSouth Wessex than I, as I looked when dashing past the shop-winders\r\nwith the rest of our company on the day we ran out o\xe2\x80\x99 Budmouth because\r\nit was thoughted that Boney had landed round the point. There was I,\r\nstraight as a young poplar, wi\xe2\x80\x99 my firelock, and my bagnet, and my\r\nspatterdashes, and my stock sawing my jaws off, and my accoutrements\r\nsheening like the seven stars! Yes, neighbours, I was a pretty sight in\r\nmy soldiering days. You ought to have seen me in four!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis his mother\xe2\x80\x99s side where Master Clym\xe2\x80\x99s figure comes from, bless\r\nye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Timothy. \xe2\x80\x9cI know\xe2\x80\x99d her brothers well. Longer coffins were\r\nnever made in the whole country of South Wessex, and \xe2\x80\x99tis said that\r\npoor George\xe2\x80\x99s knees were crumpled up a little e\xe2\x80\x99en as \xe2\x80\x99twas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCoffins, where?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Christian, drawing nearer. \xe2\x80\x9cHave the ghost\r\nof one appeared to anybody, Master Fairway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let your mind so mislead your ears, Christian; and be a\r\nman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Timothy reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will.\xe2\x80\x9d said Christian. \xe2\x80\x9cBut now I think o\xe2\x80\x99t my shadder last night\r\nseemed just the shape of a coffin. What is it a sign of when your\r\nshade\xe2\x80\x99s like a coffin, neighbours? It can\xe2\x80\x99t be nothing to be afeared\r\nof, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfeared, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grandfer. \xe2\x80\x9cFaith, I was never afeard of nothing\r\nexcept Boney, or I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 been the soldier I was. Yes, \xe2\x80\x99tis a\r\nthousand pities you didn\xe2\x80\x99t see me in four!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time the mummers were preparing to leave; but Mrs. Yeobright\r\nstopped them by asking them to sit down and have a little supper. To\r\nthis invitation Father Christmas, in the name of them all, readily\r\nagreed.\r\n\r\nEustacia was happy in the opportunity of staying a little longer. The\r\ncold and frosty night without was doubly frigid to her. But the\r\nlingering was not without its difficulties. Mrs. Yeobright, for want of\r\nroom in the larger apartment, placed a bench for the mummers halfway\r\nthrough the pantry door, which opened from the sitting-room. Here they\r\nseated themselves in a row, the door being left open\xe2\x80\x94thus they were\r\nstill virtually in the same apartment. Mrs. Yeobright now murmured a\r\nfew words to her son, who crossed the room to the pantry door, striking\r\nhis head against the mistletoe as he passed, and brought the mummers\r\nbeef and bread, cake pastry, mead, and elder-wine, the waiting being\r\ndone by him and his mother, that the little maid-servant might sit as\r\nguest. The mummers doffed their helmets, and began to eat and drink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you will surely have some?\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym to the Turkish Knight, as he\r\nstood before that warrior, tray in hand. She had refused, and still sat\r\ncovered, only the sparkle of her eyes being visible between the ribbons\r\nwhich covered her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Eustacia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s quite a youngster,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Saracen apologetically, \xe2\x80\x9cand you\r\nmust excuse him. He\xe2\x80\x99s not one of the old set, but have jined us because\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99other couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he will take something?\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Yeobright. \xe2\x80\x9cTry a glass of mead\r\nor elder-wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you had better try that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Saracen. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will keep the\r\ncold out going home-along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough Eustacia could not eat without uncovering her face she could\r\ndrink easily enough beneath her disguise. The elder-wine was\r\naccordingly accepted, and the glass vanished inside the ribbons.\r\n\r\nAt moments during this performance Eustacia was half in doubt about the\r\nsecurity of her position; yet it had a fearful joy. A series of\r\nattentions paid to her, and yet not to her but to some imaginary\r\nperson, by the first man she had ever been inclined to adore,\r\ncomplicated her emotions indescribably. She had loved him partly\r\nbecause he was exceptional in this scene, partly because she had\r\ndetermined to love him, chiefly because she was in desperate need of\r\nloving somebody after wearying of Wildeve. Believing that she must love\r\nhim in spite of herself, she had been influenced after the fashion of\r\nthe second Lord Lyttleton and other persons, who have dreamed that they\r\nwere to die on a certain day, and by stress of a morbid imagination\r\nhave actually brought about that event. Once let a maiden admit the\r\npossibility of her being stricken with love for someone at a certain\r\nhour and place, and the thing is as good as done.\r\n\r\nDid anything at this moment suggest to Yeobright the sex of the\r\ncreature whom that fantastic guise inclosed, how extended was her scope\r\nboth in feeling and in making others feel, and how far her compass\r\ntranscended that of her companions in the band? When the disguised\r\nQueen of Love appeared before \xc3\x86neas a preternatural perfume accompanied\r\nher presence and betrayed her quality. If such a mysterious emanation\r\never was projected by the emotions of an earthly woman upon their\r\nobject, it must have signified Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s presence to Yeobright now. He\r\nlooked at her wistfully, then seemed to fall into a reverie, as if he\r\nwere forgetting what he observed. The momentary situation ended, he\r\npassed on, and Eustacia sipped her wine without knowing what she drank.\r\nThe man for whom she had pre-determined to nourish a passion went into\r\nthe small room, and across it to the further extremity.\r\n\r\nThe mummers, as has been stated, were seated on a bench, one end of\r\nwhich extended into the small apartment, or pantry, for want of space\r\nin the outer room. Eustacia, partly from shyness, had chosen the\r\nmidmost seat, which thus commanded a view of the interior of the pantry\r\nas well as the room containing the guests. When Clym passed down the\r\npantry her eyes followed him in the gloom which prevailed there. At the\r\nremote end was a door which, just as he was about to open it for\r\nhimself, was opened by somebody within; and light streamed forth.\r\n\r\nThe person was Thomasin, with a candle, looking anxious, pale, and\r\ninteresting. Yeobright appeared glad to see her, and pressed her hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right, Tamsie,\xe2\x80\x9d he said heartily, as though recalled to himself\r\nby the sight of her, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have decided to come down. I am glad of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush\xe2\x80\x94no, no,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cI only came to speak to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why not join us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot. At least I would rather not. I am not well enough, and we\r\nshall have plenty of time together now you are going to be home a good\r\nlong holiday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t nearly so pleasant without you. Are you really ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust a little, my old cousin\xe2\x80\x94here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, playfully sweeping her\r\nhand across her heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Mother should have asked somebody else to be present tonight,\r\nperhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no, indeed. I merely stepped down, Clym, to ask you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Here he\r\nfollowed her through the doorway into the private room beyond, and, the\r\ndoor closing, Eustacia and the mummer who sat next to her, the only\r\nother witness of the performance, saw and heard no more.\r\n\r\nThe heat flew to Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s head and cheeks. She instantly guessed that\r\nClym, having been home only these two or three days, had not as yet\r\nbeen made acquainted with Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s painful situation with regard to\r\nWildeve; and seeing her living there just as she had been living before\r\nhe left home, he naturally suspected nothing. Eustacia felt a wild\r\njealousy of Thomasin on the instant. Though Thomasin might possibly\r\nhave tender sentiments towards another man as yet, how long could they\r\nbe expected to last when she was shut up here with this interesting and\r\ntravelled cousin of hers? There was no knowing what affection might not\r\nsoon break out between the two, so constantly in each other\xe2\x80\x99s society,\r\nand not a distracting object near. Clym\xe2\x80\x99s boyish love for her might\r\nhave languished, but it might easily be revived again.\r\n\r\nEustacia was nettled by her own contrivances. What a sheer waste of\r\nherself to be dressed thus while another was shining to advantage! Had\r\nshe known the full effect of the encounter she would have moved heaven\r\nand earth to get here in a natural manner. The power of her face all\r\nlost, the charm of her emotions all disguised, the fascinations of her\r\ncoquetry denied existence, nothing but a voice left to her; she had a\r\nsense of the doom of Echo. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody here respects me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. She had\r\noverlooked the fact that, in coming as a boy among other boys, she\r\nwould be treated as a boy. The slight, though of her own causing, and\r\nself-explanatory, she was unable to dismiss as unwittingly shown, so\r\nsensitive had the situation made her.\r\n\r\nWomen have done much for themselves in histrionic dress. To look far\r\nbelow those who, like a certain fair personator of Polly Peachum early\r\nin the last century, and another of Lydia Languish early in this,[1]\r\nhave won not only love but ducal coronets into the bargain, whole\r\nshoals of them have reached to the initial satisfaction of getting love\r\nalmost whence they would. But the Turkish Knight was denied even the\r\nchance of achieving this by the fluttering ribbons which she dared not\r\nbrush aside.\r\n\r\n [1] Written in 1877.\r\n\r\n\r\nYeobright returned to the room without his cousin. When within two or\r\nthree feet of Eustacia he stopped, as if again arrested by a thought.\r\nHe was gazing at her. She looked another way, disconcerted, and\r\nwondered how long this purgatory was to last. After lingering a few\r\nseconds he passed on again.\r\n\r\nTo court their own discomfiture by love is a common instinct with\r\ncertain perfervid women. Conflicting sensations of love, fear, and\r\nshame reduced Eustacia to a state of the utmost uneasiness. To escape\r\nwas her great and immediate desire. The other mummers appeared to be in\r\nno hurry to leave; and murmuring to the lad who sat next to her that\r\nshe preferred waiting for them outside the house, she moved to the door\r\nas imperceptibly as possible, opened it, and slipped out.\r\n\r\nThe calm, lone scene reassured her. She went forward to the palings and\r\nleant over them, looking at the moon. She had stood thus but a little\r\ntime when the door again opened. Expecting to see the remainder of the\r\nband Eustacia turned; but no\xe2\x80\x94Clym Yeobright came out as softly as she\r\nhad done, and closed the door behind him.\r\n\r\nHe advanced and stood beside her. \xe2\x80\x9cI have an odd opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand should like to ask you a question. Are you a woman\xe2\x80\x94or am I wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis eyes lingered on her with great interest. \xe2\x80\x9cDo girls often play as\r\nmummers now? They never used to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo get excitement and shake off depression,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in low tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat depressed you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a cause of depression a good many have to put up with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA long silence. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you find excitement?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Clym at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt this moment, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you are vexed at being discovered?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; though I thought I might be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would gladly have asked you to our party had I known you wished to\r\ncome. Have I ever been acquainted with you in my youth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you come in again, and stay as long as you like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I wish not to be further recognized.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you are safe with me.\xe2\x80\x9d After remaining in thought a minute he\r\nadded gently, \xe2\x80\x9cI will not intrude upon you longer. It is a strange way\r\nof meeting, and I will not ask why I find a cultivated woman playing\r\nsuch a part as this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not volunteer the reason which he seemed to hope for, and he\r\nwished her good night, going thence round to the back of the house,\r\nwhere he walked up and down by himself for some time before\r\nre-entering.\r\n\r\nEustacia, warmed with an inner fire, could not wait for her companions\r\nafter this. She flung back the ribbons from her face, opened the gate,\r\nand at once struck into the heath. She did not hasten along. Her\r\ngrandfather was in bed at this hour, for she so frequently walked upon\r\nthe hills on moonlight nights that he took no notice of her comings and\r\ngoings, and, enjoying himself in his own way, left her to do likewise.\r\nA more important subject than that of getting indoors now engrossed\r\nher. Yeobright, if he had the least curiosity, would infallibly\r\ndiscover her name. What then? She first felt a sort of exultation at\r\nthe way in which the adventure had terminated, even though at moments\r\nbetween her exultations she was abashed and blushful. Then this\r\nconsideration recurred to chill her: What was the use of her exploit?\r\nShe was at present a total stranger to the Yeobright family. The\r\nunreasonable nimbus of romance with which she had encircled that man\r\nmight be her misery. How could she allow herself to become so\r\ninfatuated with a stranger? And to fill the cup of her sorrow there\r\nwould be Thomasin, living day after day in inflammable proximity to\r\nhim; for she had just learnt that, contrary to her first belief, he was\r\ngoing to stay at home some considerable time.\r\n\r\nShe reached the wicket at Mistover Knap, but before opening it she\r\nturned and faced the heath once more. The form of Rainbarrow stood\r\nabove the hills, and the moon stood above Rainbarrow. The air was\r\ncharged with silence and frost. The scene reminded Eustacia of a\r\ncircumstance which till that moment she had totally forgotten. She had\r\npromised to meet Wildeve by the Barrow this very night at eight, to\r\ngive a final answer to his pleading for an elopement.\r\n\r\nShe herself had fixed the evening and the hour. He had probably come to\r\nthe spot, waited there in the cold, and been greatly disappointed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, so much the better\xe2\x80\x94it did not hurt him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said serenely.\r\nWildeve had at present the rayless outline of the sun through smoked\r\nglass, and she could say such things as that with the greatest\r\nfacility.\r\n\r\nShe remained deeply pondering; and Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s winning manner towards\r\nher cousin arose again upon Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO that she had been married to Damon before this!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd she\r\nwould if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for me! If I had only known\xe2\x80\x94if I had only\r\nknown!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEustacia once more lifted her deep stormy eyes to the moonlight, and,\r\nsighing that tragic sigh of hers which was so much like a shudder,\r\nentered the shadow of the roof. She threw off her trappings in the\r\nouthouse, rolled them up, and went indoors to her chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\nA Coalition between Beauty and Oddness\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old captain\xe2\x80\x99s prevailing indifference to his granddaughter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmovements left her free as a bird to follow her own courses; but it so\r\nhappened that he did take upon himself the next morning to ask her why\r\nshe had walked out so late.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly in search of events, Grandfather,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking out of the\r\nwindow with that drowsy latency of manner which discovered so much\r\nforce behind it whenever the trigger was pressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSearch of events\xe2\x80\x94one would think you were one of the bucks I knew at\r\none-and-twenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is lonely here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better. If I were living in a town my whole time would be\r\ntaken up in looking after you. I fully expected you would have been\r\nhome when I returned from the Woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t conceal what I did. I wanted an adventure, and I went with the\r\nmummers. I played the part of the Turkish Knight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, never? Ha, ha! Good gad! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect it of you, Eustacia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was my first performance, and it certainly will be my last. Now I\r\nhave told you\xe2\x80\x94and remember it is a secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. But, Eustacia, you never did\xe2\x80\x94ha! ha! Dammy, how \xe2\x80\x99twould\r\nhave pleased me forty years ago! But remember, no more of it, my girl.\r\nYou may walk on the heath night or day, as you choose, so that you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t bother me; but no figuring in breeches again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need have no fear for me, Grandpapa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the conversation ceased, Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s moral training never exceeding\r\nin severity a dialogue of this sort, which, if it ever became\r\nprofitable to good works, would be a result not dear at the price. But\r\nher thoughts soon strayed far from her own personality; and, full of a\r\npassionate and indescribable solicitude for one to whom she was not\r\neven a name, she went forth into the amplitude of tanned wild around\r\nher, restless as Ahasuerus the Jew. She was about half a mile from her\r\nresidence when she beheld a sinister redness arising from a ravine a\r\nlittle way in advance\xe2\x80\x94dull and lurid like a flame in sunlight and she\r\nguessed it to signify Diggory Venn.\r\n\r\nWhen the farmers who had wished to buy in a new stock of reddle during\r\nthe last month had inquired where Venn was to be found, people replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn Egdon Heath.\xe2\x80\x9d Day after day the answer was the same. Now, since\r\nEgdon was populated with heath-croppers and furze-cutters rather than\r\nwith sheep and shepherds, and the downs where most of the latter were\r\nto be found lay some to the north, some to the west of Egdon, his\r\nreason for camping about there like Israel in Zin was not apparent. The\r\nposition was central and occasionally desirable. But the sale of reddle\r\nwas not Diggory\xe2\x80\x99s primary object in remaining on the heath,\r\nparticularly at so late a period of the year, when most travellers of\r\nhis class had gone into winter quarters.\r\n\r\nEustacia looked at the lonely man. Wildeve had told her at their last\r\nmeeting that Venn had been thrust forward by Mrs. Yeobright as one\r\nready and anxious to take his place as Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s betrothed. His figure\r\nwas perfect, his face young and well outlined, his eye bright, his\r\nintelligence keen, and his position one which he could readily better\r\nif he chose. But in spite of possibilities it was not likely that\r\nThomasin would accept this Ishmaelitish creature while she had a cousin\r\nlike Yeobright at her elbow, and Wildeve at the same time not\r\nabsolutely indifferent. Eustacia was not long in guessing that poor\r\nMrs. Yeobright, in her anxiety for her niece\xe2\x80\x99s future, had mentioned\r\nthis lover to stimulate the zeal of the other. Eustacia was on the side\r\nof the Yeobrights now, and entered into the spirit of the aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reddleman, taking off his cap of\r\nhareskin, and apparently bearing her no ill-will from recollection of\r\ntheir last meeting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, reddleman,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, hardly troubling to lift her\r\nheavily shaded eyes to his. \xe2\x80\x9cI did not know you were so near. Is your\r\nvan here too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVenn moved his elbow towards a hollow in which a dense brake of\r\npurple-stemmed brambles had grown to such vast dimensions as almost to\r\nform a dell. Brambles, though churlish when handled, are kindly shelter\r\nin early winter, being the latest of the deciduous bushes to lose their\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nThe roof and chimney of Venn\xe2\x80\x99s caravan showed behind the tracery and\r\ntangles of the brake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remain near this part?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked with more interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have business here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot altogether the selling of reddle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has nothing to do with that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has to do with Miss Yeobright?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer face seemed to ask for an armed peace, and he therefore said\r\nfrankly, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, miss; it is on account of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn account of your approaching marriage with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVenn flushed through his stain. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make sport of me, Miss Vye,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was thus convinced that the reddleman was a mere _pis aller_ in\r\nMrs. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s mind; one, moreover, who had not even been informed of\r\nhis promotion to that lowly standing. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a mere notion of mine,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said quietly; and was about to pass by without further speech,\r\nwhen, looking round to the right, she saw a painfully well-known figure\r\nserpentining upwards by one of the little paths which led to the top\r\nwhere she stood. Owing to the necessary windings of his course his back\r\nwas at present towards them. She glanced quickly round; to escape that\r\nman there was only one way. Turning to Venn, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cWould you allow\r\nme to rest a few minutes in your van? The banks are damp for sitting\r\non.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, miss; I\xe2\x80\x99ll make a place for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe followed him behind the dell of brambles to his wheeled dwelling\r\ninto which Venn mounted, placing the three-legged stool just within the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the best I can do for you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, stepping down and\r\nretiring to the path, where he resumed the smoking of his pipe as he\r\nwalked up and down.\r\n\r\nEustacia bounded into the vehicle and sat on the stool, ensconced from\r\nview on the side towards the trackway. Soon she heard the brushing of\r\nother feet than the reddleman\xe2\x80\x99s, a not very friendly \xe2\x80\x9cGood day\xe2\x80\x9d uttered\r\nby two men in passing each other, and then the dwindling of the\r\nfoot-fall of one of them in a direction onwards. Eustacia stretched her\r\nneck forward till she caught a glimpse of a receding back and\r\nshoulders; and she felt a wretched twinge of misery, she knew not why.\r\nIt was the sickening feeling which, if the changed heart has any\r\ngenerosity at all in its composition, accompanies the sudden sight of a\r\nonce-loved one who is beloved no more.\r\n\r\nWhen Eustacia descended to proceed on her way the reddleman came near.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was Mr. Wildeve who passed, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly, and expressed\r\nby his face that he expected her to feel vexed at having been sitting\r\nunseen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I saw him coming up the hill,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Eustacia. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you\r\ntell me that?\xe2\x80\x9d It was a bold question, considering the reddleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknowledge of her past love; but her undemonstrative manner had power to\r\nrepress the opinions of those she treated as remote from her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to hear that you can ask it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reddleman bluntly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, now I think of it, it agrees with what I saw last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94what was that?\xe2\x80\x9d Eustacia wished to leave him, but wished to know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Wildeve stayed at Rainbarrow a long time waiting for a lady who\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou waited too, it seems?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I always do. I was glad to see him disappointed. He will be there\r\nagain tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be again disappointed. The truth is, reddleman, that that lady, so\r\nfar from wishing to stand in the way of Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s marriage with Mr.\r\nWildeve, would be very glad to promote it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVenn felt much astonishment at this avowal, though he did not show it\r\nclearly; that exhibition may greet remarks which are one remove from\r\nexpectation, but it is usually withheld in complicated cases of two\r\nremoves and upwards. \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know that Mr. Wildeve will come to Rainbarrow again\r\ntonight?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard him say to himself that he would. He\xe2\x80\x99s in a regular temper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEustacia looked for a moment what she felt, and she murmured, lifting\r\nher deep dark eyes anxiously to his, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I knew what to do. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant to be uncivil to him; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to see him again; and I\r\nhave some few little things to return to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you choose to send \xe2\x80\x99em by me, miss, and a note to tell him that you\r\nwish to say no more to him, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it for you quite privately. That\r\nwould be the most straightforward way of letting him know your mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia. \xe2\x80\x9cCome towards my house, and I will bring it\r\nout to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went on, and as the path was an infinitely small parting in the\r\nshaggy locks of the heath, the reddleman followed exactly in her trail.\r\nShe saw from a distance that the captain was on the bank sweeping the\r\nhorizon with his telescope; and bidding Venn to wait where he stood she\r\nentered the house alone.\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes she returned with a parcel and a note, and said, in\r\nplacing them in his hand, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you so ready to take these for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you ask that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you think to serve Thomasin in some way by it. Are you as\r\nanxious as ever to help on her marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVenn was a little moved. \xe2\x80\x9cI would sooner have married her myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid in a low voice. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what I feel is that if she cannot be happy\r\nwithout him I will do my duty in helping her to get him, as a man\r\nought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEustacia looked curiously at the singular man who spoke thus. What a\r\nstrange sort of love, to be entirely free from that quality of\r\nselfishness which is frequently the chief constituent of the passion,\r\nand sometimes its only one! The reddleman\xe2\x80\x99s disinterestedness was so\r\nwell deserving of respect that it overshot respect by being barely\r\ncomprehended; and she almost thought it absurd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we are both of one mind at last,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Venn gloomily. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if you would tell me, miss, why you\r\ntake such an interest in her, I should be easier. It is so sudden and\r\nstrange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEustacia appeared at a loss. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell you that, reddleman,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid coldly.\r\n\r\nVenn said no more. He pocketed the letter, and, bowing to Eustacia,\r\nwent away.\r\n\r\nRainbarrow had again become blended with night when Wildeve ascended\r\nthe long acclivity at its base. On his reaching the top a shape grew up\r\nfrom the earth immediately behind him. It was that of Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nemissary. He slapped Wildeve on the shoulder. The feverish young\r\ninn-keeper and ex-engineer started like Satan at the touch of\r\nIthuriel\xe2\x80\x99s spear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe meeting is always at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, at this place,\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand here we are\xe2\x80\x94we three.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe three?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve, looking quickly round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; you, and I, and she. This is she.\xe2\x80\x9d He held up the letter and\r\nparcel.\r\n\r\nWildeve took them wonderingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite see what this means,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you come here? There must be some mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be cleared from your mind when you have read the letter.\r\nLanterns for one.\xe2\x80\x9d The reddleman struck a light, kindled an inch of\r\ntallow-candle which he had brought, and sheltered it with his cap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve, discerning by the candle-light an obscure\r\nrubicundity of person in his companion. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are the reddleman I saw on\r\nthe hill this morning\xe2\x80\x94why, you are the man who\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease read the letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had come from the other one I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been surprised,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nmurmured Wildeve as he opened the letter and read. His face grew\r\nserious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Mr. WILDEVE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter some thought I have decided once and for all that we must hold\r\nno further communication. The more I consider the matter the more I am\r\nconvinced that there must be an end to our acquaintance. Had you been\r\nuniformly faithful to me throughout these two years you might now have\r\nsome ground for accusing me of heartlessness; but if you calmly\r\nconsider what I bore during the period of your desertion, and how I\r\npassively put up with your courtship of another without once\r\ninterfering, you will, I think, own that I have a right to consult my\r\nown feelings when you come back to me again. That these are not what\r\nthey were towards you may, perhaps, be a fault in me, but it is one\r\nwhich you can scarcely reproach me for when you remember how you left\r\nme for Thomasin.\r\n    The little articles you gave me in the early part of our friendship\r\n    are returned by the bearer of this letter. They should rightly have\r\n    been sent back when I first heard of your engagement to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEUSTACIA.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time that Wildeve reached her name the blankness with which he\r\nhad read the first half of the letter intensified to mortification. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam made a great fool of, one way and another,\xe2\x80\x9d he said pettishly. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou know what is in this letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reddleman hummed a tune.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you answer me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Wildeve warmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRu-um-tum-tum,\xe2\x80\x9d sang the reddleman.\r\n\r\nWildeve stood looking on the ground beside Venn\xe2\x80\x99s feet, till he allowed\r\nhis eyes to travel upwards over Diggory\xe2\x80\x99s form, as illuminated by the\r\ncandle, to his head and face. \xe2\x80\x9cHa-ha! Well, I suppose I deserve it,\r\nconsidering how I have played with them both,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, as much\r\nto himself as to Venn. \xe2\x80\x9cBut of all the odd things that ever I knew, the\r\noddest is that you should so run counter to your own interests as to\r\nbring this to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy interests?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. \xe2\x80\x99Twas your interest not to do anything which would send me\r\ncourting Thomasin again, now she has accepted you\xe2\x80\x94or something like it.\r\nMrs. Yeobright says you are to marry her. \xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t true, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord! I heard of this before, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. When did she\r\nsay so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWildeve began humming as the reddleman had done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it now,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Venn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRu-um-tum-tum,\xe2\x80\x9d sang Wildeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Lord\xe2\x80\x94how we can imitate!\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn contemptuously. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have this\r\nout. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go straight to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDiggory withdrew with an emphatic step, Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s eye passing over his\r\nform in withering derision, as if he were no more than a heath-cropper.\r\nWhen the reddleman\xe2\x80\x99s figure could no longer be seen, Wildeve himself\r\ndescended and plunged into the rayless hollow of the vale.\r\n\r\nTo lose the two women\xe2\x80\x94he who had been the well-beloved of both\xe2\x80\x94was too\r\nironical an issue to be endured. He could only decently save himself by\r\nThomasin; and once he became her husband, Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s repentance, he\r\nthought, would set in for a long and bitter term. It was no wonder that\r\nWildeve, ignorant of the new man at the back of the scene, should have\r\nsupposed Eustacia to be playing a part. To believe that the letter was\r\nnot the result of some momentary pique, to infer that she really gave\r\nhim up to Thomasin, would have required previous knowledge of her\r\ntransfiguration by that man\xe2\x80\x99s influence. Who was to know that she had\r\ngrown generous in the greediness of a new passion, that in coveting one\r\ncousin she was dealing liberally with another, that in her eagerness to\r\nappropriate she gave way?\r\n\r\nFull of this resolve to marry in haste, and wring the heart of the\r\nproud girl, Wildeve went his way.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Diggory Venn had returned to his van, where he stood looking\r\nthoughtfully into the stove. A new vista was opened up to him. But,\r\nhowever promising Mrs. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s views of him might be as a candidate\r\nfor her niece\xe2\x80\x99s hand, one condition was indispensable to the favour of\r\nThomasin herself, and that was a renunciation of his present wild mode\r\nof life. In this he saw little difficulty.\r\n\r\nHe could not afford to wait till the next day before seeing Thomasin\r\nand detailing his plan. He speedily plunged himself into toilet\r\noperations, pulled a suit of cloth clothes from a box, and in about\r\ntwenty minutes stood before the van-lantern as a reddleman in nothing\r\nbut his face, the vermilion shades of which were not to be removed in a\r\nday. Closing the door and fastening it with a padlock, Venn set off\r\ntowards Blooms-End.\r\n\r\nHe had reached the white palings and laid his hand upon the gate when\r\nthe door of the house opened, and quickly closed again. A female form\r\nhad glided in. At the same time a man, who had seemingly been standing\r\nwith the woman in the porch, came forward from the house till he was\r\nface to face with Venn. It was Wildeve again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMan alive, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been quick at it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diggory sarcastically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you slow, as you will find,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d lowering his\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may as well go back again now. I\xe2\x80\x99ve claimed her, and got\r\nher. Good night, reddleman!\xe2\x80\x9d Thereupon Wildeve walked away.\r\n\r\nVenn\xe2\x80\x99s heart sank within him, though it had not risen unduly high. He\r\nstood leaning over the palings in an indecisive mood for nearly a\r\nquarter of an hour. Then he went up the garden path, knocked, and asked\r\nfor Mrs. Yeobright.\r\n\r\nInstead of requesting him to enter she came to the porch. A discourse\r\nwas carried on between them in low measured tones for the space of ten\r\nminutes or more. At the end of the time Mrs. Yeobright went in, and\r\nVenn sadly retraced his steps into the heath. When he had again\r\nregained his van he lit the lantern, and with an apathetic face at once\r\nbegan to pull off his best clothes, till in the course of a few minutes\r\nhe reappeared as the confirmed and irretrievable reddleman that he had\r\nseemed before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\nFirmness Is Discovered in a Gentle Heart\r\n\r\n\r\nOn that evening the interior of Blooms-End, though cosy and\r\ncomfortable, had been rather silent. Clym Yeobright was not at home.\r\nSince the Christmas party he had gone on a few days\xe2\x80\x99 visit to a friend\r\nabout ten miles off.\r\n\r\nThe shadowy form seen by Venn to part from Wildeve in the porch, and\r\nquickly withdraw into the house, was Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s. On entering she threw\r\ndown a cloak which had been carelessly wrapped round her, and came\r\nforward to the light, where Mrs. Yeobright sat at her work-table, drawn\r\nup within the settle, so that part of it projected into the\r\nchimney-corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like your going out after dark alone, Tamsin,\xe2\x80\x9d said her aunt\r\nquietly, without looking up from her work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have only been just outside the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mrs. Yeobright, struck by a change in the tone of\r\nThomasin\xe2\x80\x99s voice, and observing her. Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s cheek was flushed to a\r\npitch far beyond that which it had reached before her troubles, and her\r\neyes glittered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was _he_ who knocked,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought as much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wishes the marriage to be at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! What\xe2\x80\x94is he anxious?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Yeobright directed a searching look\r\nupon her niece. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did not Mr. Wildeve come in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did not wish to. You are not friends with him, he says. He would\r\nlike the wedding to be the day after tomorrow, quite privately; at the\r\nchurch of his parish\xe2\x80\x94not at ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! And what did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI agreed to it,\xe2\x80\x9d Thomasin answered firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a practical woman\r\nnow. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in hearts at all. I would marry him under any\r\ncircumstances since\xe2\x80\x94since Clym\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA letter was lying on Mrs. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s work-basket, and at Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwords her aunt reopened it, and silently read for the tenth time that\r\nday:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the meaning of this silly story that people are circulating\r\nabout Thomasin and Mr. Wildeve? I should call such a scandal\r\nhumiliating if there was the least chance of its being true. How could\r\nsuch a gross falsehood have arisen? It is said that one should go\r\nabroad to hear news of home, and I appear to have done it. Of course I\r\ncontradict the tale everywhere; but it is very vexing, and I wonder how\r\nit could have originated. It is too ridiculous that such a girl as\r\nThomasin could so mortify us as to get jilted on the wedding day. What\r\nhas she done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Yeobright said sadly, putting down the letter. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\r\nthink you can marry him, do so. And since Mr. Wildeve wishes it to be\r\nunceremonious, let it be that too. I can do nothing. It is all in your\r\nown hands now. My power over your welfare came to an end when you left\r\nthis house to go with him to Anglebury.\xe2\x80\x9d She continued, half in\r\nbitterness, \xe2\x80\x9cI may almost ask, why do you consult me in the matter at\r\nall? If you had gone and married him without saying a word to me, I\r\ncould hardly have been angry\xe2\x80\x94simply because, poor girl, you can\xe2\x80\x99t do a\r\nbetter thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say that and dishearten me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right\xe2\x80\x94I will not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not plead for him, Aunt. Human nature is weak, and I am not a\r\nblind woman to insist that he is perfect. I did think so, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nnow. But I know my course, and you know that I know it. I hope for the\r\nbest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so do I, and we will both continue to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright,\r\nrising and kissing her. \xe2\x80\x9cThen the wedding, if it comes off, will be on\r\nthe morning of the very day Clym comes home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I decided that it ought to be over before he came. After that you\r\ncan look him in the face, and so can I. Our concealments will matter\r\nnothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Yeobright moved her head in thoughtful assent, and presently said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you wish me to give you away? I am willing to undertake that, you\r\nknow, if you wish, as I was last time. After once forbidding the banns\r\nI think I can do no less.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I will ask you to come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomasin reluctantly, but\r\nwith decision. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be unpleasant, I am almost sure. Better let\r\nthere be only strangers present, and none of my relations at all. I\r\nwould rather have it so. I do not wish to do anything which may touch\r\nyour credit, and I feel that I should be uncomfortable if you were\r\nthere, after what has passed. I am only your niece, and there is no\r\nnecessity why you should concern yourself more about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he has beaten us,\xe2\x80\x9d her aunt said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt really seems as if he had\r\nbeen playing with you in this way in revenge for my humbling him as I\r\ndid by standing up against him at first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no, Aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Thomasin.\r\n\r\nThey said no more on the subject then. Diggory Venn\xe2\x80\x99s knock came soon\r\nafter; and Mrs. Yeobright, on returning from her interview with him in\r\nthe porch, carelessly observed, \xe2\x80\x9cAnother lover has come to ask for\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that queer young man Venn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsks to pay his addresses to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and I told him he was too late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThomasin looked silently into the candle-flame. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Diggory!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, and then aroused herself to other things.\r\n\r\nThe next day was passed in mere mechanical deeds of preparation, both\r\nthe women being anxious to immerse themselves in these to escape the\r\nemotional aspect of the situation. Some wearing apparel and other\r\narticles were collected anew for Thomasin, and remarks on domestic\r\ndetails were frequently made, so as to obscure any inner misgivings\r\nabout her future as Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\nThe appointed morning came. The arrangement with Wildeve was that he\r\nshould meet her at the church to guard against any unpleasant curiosity\r\nwhich might have affected them had they been seen walking off together\r\nin the usual country way.\r\n\r\nAunt and niece stood together in the bedroom where the bride was\r\ndressing. The sun, where it could catch it, made a mirror of Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhair, which she always wore braided. It was braided according to a\r\ncalendar system\xe2\x80\x94the more important the day the more numerous the\r\nstrands in the braid. On ordinary working-days she braided it in\r\nthrees; on ordinary Sundays in fours; at Maypolings, gipsyings, and the\r\nlike, she braided it in fives. Years ago she had said that when she\r\nmarried she would braid it in sevens. She had braided it in sevens\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been thinking that I will wear my blue silk after all,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is my wedding day, even though there may be something sad\r\nabout the time. I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, anxious to correct any wrong\r\nimpression, \xe2\x80\x9cnot sad in itself, but in its having had great\r\ndisappointment and trouble before it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Yeobright breathed in a way which might have been called a sigh.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI almost wish Clym had been at home,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course you chose\r\nthe time because of his absence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPartly. I have felt that I acted unfairly to him in not telling him\r\nall; but, as it was done not to grieve him, I thought I would carry out\r\nthe plan to its end, and tell the whole story when the sky was clear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a practical little woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwish you and he\xe2\x80\x94no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish anything. There, it is nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe interrupted, hearing a whizz and a dinging downstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told Damon I would leave at nine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomasin, hastening out of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nHer aunt followed. When Thomasin was going up the little walk from the\r\ndoor to the wicket-gate, Mrs. Yeobright looked reluctantly at her, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a shame to let you go alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomasin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d added her aunt with forced cheerfulness, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall call\r\nupon you this afternoon, and bring the cake with me. If Clym has\r\nreturned by that time he will perhaps come too. I wish to show Mr.\r\nWildeve that I bear him no ill-will. Let the past be forgotten. Well,\r\nGod bless you! There, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in old superstitions, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll do\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d She threw a slipper at the retreating figure of the girl, who\r\nturned, smiled, and went on again.\r\n\r\nA few steps further, and she looked back. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you call me, Aunt?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ntremulously inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMoved by an uncontrollable feeling as she looked upon Mrs. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nworn, wet face, she ran back, when her aunt came forward, and they met\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cO\xe2\x80\x94Tamsie,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder, weeping, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to let you\r\ngo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I am\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Thomasin began, giving way likewise. But, quelling her grief,\r\nshe said \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d again and went on.\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Yeobright saw a little figure wending its way between the\r\nscratching furze-bushes, and diminishing far up the valley\xe2\x80\x94a pale-blue\r\nspot in a vast field of neutral brown, solitary and undefended except\r\nby the power of her own hope.\r\n\r\nBut the worst feature in the case was one which did not appear in the\r\nlandscape; it was the man.\r\n\r\nThe hour chosen for the ceremony by Thomasin and Wildeve had been so\r\ntimed as to enable her to escape the awkwardness of meeting her cousin\r\nClym, who was returning the same morning. To own to the partial truth\r\nof what he had heard would be distressing as long as the humiliating\r\nposition resulting from the event was unimproved. It was only after a\r\nsecond and successful journey to the altar that she could lift up her\r\nhead and prove the failure of the first attempt a pure accident.\r\n\r\nShe had not been gone from Blooms-End more than half an hour when\r\nYeobright came by the meads from the other direction and entered the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had an early breakfast,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his mother after greeting her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I could eat a little more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey sat down to the repeated meal, and he went on in a low, anxious\r\nvoice, apparently imagining that Thomasin had not yet come downstairs,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this I have heard about Thomasin and Mr. Wildeve?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true in many points,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright quietly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is\r\nall right now, I hope.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at the clock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThomasin is gone to him today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClym pushed away his breakfast. \xe2\x80\x9cThen there is a scandal of some sort,\r\nand that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with Thomasin. Was it this that made her\r\nill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Not a scandal\xe2\x80\x94a misfortune. I will tell you all about it, Clym.\r\nYou must not be angry, but you must listen, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll find that what\r\nwe have done has been done for the best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe then told him the circumstances. All that he had known of the\r\naffair before he returned from Paris was that there had existed an\r\nattachment between Thomasin and Wildeve, which his mother had at first\r\ndiscountenanced, but had since, owing to the arguments of Thomasin,\r\nlooked upon in a little more favourable light. When she, therefore,\r\nproceeded to explain all he was greatly surprised and troubled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she determined that the wedding should be over before you came\r\nback,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there might be no chance of her\r\nmeeting you, and having a very painful time of it. That\xe2\x80\x99s why she has\r\ngone to him; they have arranged to be married this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yeobright, rising. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis so unlike\r\nher. I can see why you did not write to me after her unfortunate return\r\nhome. But why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you let me know when the wedding was going to\r\nbe\xe2\x80\x94the first time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I felt vexed with her just then. She seemed to me to be\r\nobstinate; and when I found that you were nothing in her mind I vowed\r\nthat she should be nothing in yours. I felt that she was only my niece\r\nafter all; I told her she might marry, but that I should take no\r\ninterest in it, and should not bother you about it either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been bothering me. Mother, you did wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it might disturb you in your business, and that you might\r\nthrow up your situation, or injure your prospects in some way because\r\nof it, so I said nothing. Of course, if they had married at that time\r\nin a proper manner, I should have told you at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTamsin actually being married while we are sitting here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Unless some accident happens again, as it did the first time. It\r\nmay, considering he\xe2\x80\x99s the same man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and I believe it will. Was it right to let her go? Suppose\r\nWildeve is really a bad fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he won\xe2\x80\x99t come, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll come home again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have looked more into it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is useless to say that,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother answered with an impatient look\r\nof sorrow. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know how bad it has been here with us all these\r\nweeks, Clym. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a mortification anything of that sort\r\nis to a woman. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know the sleepless nights we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in this\r\nhouse, and the almost bitter words that have passed between us since\r\nthat Fifth of November. I hope never to pass seven such weeks again.\r\nTamsin has not gone outside the door, and I have been ashamed to look\r\nanybody in the face; and now you blame me for letting her do the only\r\nthing that can be done to set that trouble straight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cUpon the whole I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame you. But just\r\nconsider how sudden it seems to me. Here was I, knowing nothing; and\r\nthen I am told all at once that Tamsie is gone to be married. Well, I\r\nsuppose there was nothing better to do. Do you know, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued after a moment or two, looking suddenly interested in his own\r\npast history, \xe2\x80\x9cI once thought of Tamsin as a sweetheart? Yes, I did.\r\nHow odd boys are! And when I came home and saw her this time she seemed\r\nso much more affectionate than usual, that I was quite reminded of\r\nthose days, particularly on the night of the party, when she was\r\nunwell. We had the party just the same\xe2\x80\x94was not that rather cruel to\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt made no difference. I had arranged to give one, and it was not\r\nworth while to make more gloom than necessary. To begin by shutting\r\nourselves up and telling you of Tamsin\xe2\x80\x99s misfortunes would have been a\r\npoor sort of welcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClym remained thinking. \xe2\x80\x9cI almost wish you had not had that party,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid; \xe2\x80\x9cand for other reasons. But I will tell you in a day or two. We\r\nmust think of Tamsin now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey lapsed into silence. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yeobright again,\r\nin a tone which showed some slumbering feeling still. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\r\nkind to Tamsin to let her be married like this, and neither of us there\r\nto keep up her spirits or care a bit about her. She hasn\xe2\x80\x99t disgraced\r\nherself, or done anything to deserve that. It is bad enough that the\r\nwedding should be so hurried and unceremonious, without our keeping\r\naway from it in addition. Upon my soul, \xe2\x80\x99tis almost a shame. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is over by this time,\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother with a sigh; \xe2\x80\x9cunless they\r\nwere late, or he\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I shall be soon enough to see them come out. I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite like\r\nyour keeping me in ignorance, Mother, after all. Really, I half hope he\r\nhas failed to meet her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd ruined her character?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense\xe2\x80\x94that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ruin Thomasin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took up his hat and hastily left the house. Mrs. Yeobright looked\r\nrather unhappy, and sat still, deep in thought. But she was not long\r\nleft alone. A few minutes later Clym came back again, and in his\r\ncompany came Diggory Venn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI find there isn\xe2\x80\x99t time for me to get there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she married?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Yeobright inquired, turning to the reddleman a\r\nface in which a strange strife of wishes, for and against, was\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nVenn bowed. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow strange it sounds,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Clym.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he didn\xe2\x80\x99t disappoint her this time?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did not. And there is now no slight on her name. I was hastening\r\nath\xe2\x80\x99art to tell you at once, as I saw you were not there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow came you to be there? How did you know it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been in that neighbourhood for some time, and I saw them go\r\nin,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reddleman. \xe2\x80\x9cWildeve came up to the door, punctual as the\r\nclock. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect it of him.\xe2\x80\x9d He did not add, as he might have\r\nadded, that how he came to be in that neighbourhood was not by\r\naccident; that, since Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s resumption of his right to Thomasin,\r\nVenn, with the thoroughness which was part of his character, had\r\ndetermined to see the end of the episode.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was there?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody hardly. I stood right out of the way, and she did not see me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe reddleman spoke huskily, and looked into the garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho gave her away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow very remarkable! Miss Vye! It is to be considered an honour, I\r\nsuppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s Miss Vye?\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Vye\xe2\x80\x99s granddaughter, of Mistover Knap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA proud girl from Budmouth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright. \xe2\x80\x9cOne not much to my\r\nliking. People say she\xe2\x80\x99s a witch, but of course that\xe2\x80\x99s absurd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reddleman kept to himself his acquaintance with that fair\r\npersonage, and also that Eustacia was there because he went to fetch\r\nher, in accordance with a promise he had given as soon as he learnt\r\nthat the marriage was to take place. He merely said, in continuation of\r\nthe story\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was sitting on the churchyard wall when they came up, one from one\r\nway, the other from the other; and Miss Vye was walking thereabouts,\r\nlooking at the headstones. As soon as they had gone in I went to the\r\ndoor, feeling I should like to see it, as I knew her so well. I pulled\r\noff my boots because they were so noisy, and went up into the gallery.\r\nI saw then that the parson and clerk were already there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow came Miss Vye to have anything to do with it, if she was only on a\r\nwalk that way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause there was nobody else. She had gone into the church just\r\nbefore me, not into the gallery. The parson looked round before\r\nbeginning, and as she was the only one near he beckoned to her, and she\r\nwent up to the rails. After that, when it came to signing the book, she\r\npushed up her veil and signed; and Tamsin seemed to thank her for her\r\nkindness.\xe2\x80\x9d The reddleman told the tale thoughtfully for there lingered\r\nupon his vision the changing colour of Wildeve, when Eustacia lifted\r\nthe thick veil which had concealed her from recognition and looked\r\ncalmly into his face. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diggory sadly, \xe2\x80\x9cI came away, for\r\nher history as Tamsin Yeobright was over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI offered to go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright regretfully. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she said it\r\nwas not necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is no matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reddleman. \xe2\x80\x9cThe thing is done at last\r\nas it was meant to be at first, and God send her happiness. Now I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwish you good morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe placed his cap on his head and went out.\r\n\r\nFrom that instant of leaving Mrs. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s door, the reddleman was\r\nseen no more in or about Egdon Heath for a space of many months. He\r\nvanished entirely. The nook among the brambles where his van had been\r\nstanding was as vacant as ever the next morning, and scarcely a sign\r\nremained to show that he had been there, excepting a few straws, and a\r\nlittle redness on the turf, which was washed away by the next storm of\r\nrain.\r\n\r\nThe report that Diggory had brought of the wedding, correct as far as\r\nit went, was deficient in one significant particular, which had escaped\r\nhim through his being at some distance back in the church. When\r\nThomasin was tremblingly engaged in signing her name Wildeve had flung\r\ntowards Eustacia a glance that said plainly, \xe2\x80\x9cI have punished you now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe had replied in a low tone\xe2\x80\x94and he little thought how truly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmistake; it gives me sincerest pleasure to see her your wife today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THIRD\xe2\x80\x94THE FASCINATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Mind to Me a Kingdom Is\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Clym Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s face could be dimly seen the typical countenance of\r\nthe future. Should there be a classic period to art hereafter, its\r\nPheidias may produce such faces. The view of life as a thing to be put\r\nup with, replacing that zest for existence which was so intense in\r\nearly civilizations, must ultimately enter so thoroughly into the\r\nconstitution of the advanced races that its facial expression will\r\nbecome accepted as a new artistic departure. People already feel that a\r\nman who lives without disturbing a curve of feature, or setting a mark\r\nof mental concern anywhere upon himself, is too far removed from modern\r\nperceptiveness to be a modern type. Physically beautiful men\xe2\x80\x94the glory\r\nof the race when it was young\xe2\x80\x94are almost an anachronism now; and we may\r\nwonder whether, at some time or other, physically beautiful women may\r\nnot be an anachronism likewise.\r\n\r\nThe truth seems to be that a long line of disillusive centuries has\r\npermanently displaced the Hellenic idea of life, or whatever it may be\r\ncalled. What the Greeks only suspected we know well; what their\r\n\xc3\x86schylus imagined our nursery children feel. That old-fashioned\r\nrevelling in the general situation grows less and less possible as we\r\nuncover the defects of natural laws, and see the quandary that man is\r\nin by their operation.\r\n\r\nThe lineaments which will get embodied in ideals based upon this new\r\nrecognition will probably be akin to those of Yeobright. The observer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neye was arrested, not by his face as a picture, but by his face as a\r\npage; not by what it was, but by what it recorded. His features were\r\nattractive in the light of symbols, as sounds intrinsically common\r\nbecome attractive in language, and as shapes intrinsically simple\r\nbecome interesting in writing.\r\n\r\nHe had been a lad of whom something was expected. Beyond this all had\r\nbeen chaos. That he would be successful in an original way, or that he\r\nwould go to the dogs in an original way, seemed equally probable. The\r\nonly absolute certainty about him was that he would not stand still in\r\nthe circumstances amid which he was born.\r\n\r\nHence, when his name was casually mentioned by neighbouring yeomen, the\r\nlistener said, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Clym Yeobright\xe2\x80\x94what is he doing now?\xe2\x80\x9d When the\r\ninstinctive question about a person is, What is he doing? it is felt\r\nthat he will be found to be, like most of us, doing nothing in\r\nparticular. There is an indefinite sense that he must be invading some\r\nregion of singularity, good or bad. The devout hope is that he is doing\r\nwell. The secret faith is that he is making a mess of it. Half a dozen\r\ncomfortable market-men, who were habitual callers at the Quiet Woman as\r\nthey passed by in their carts, were partial to the topic. In fact,\r\nthough they were not Egdon men, they could hardly avoid it while they\r\nsucked their long clay tubes and regarded the heath through the window.\r\nClym had been so inwoven with the heath in his boyhood that hardly\r\nanybody could look upon it without thinking of him. So the subject\r\nrecurred: if he were making a fortune and a name, so much the better\r\nfor him; if he were making a tragical figure in the world, so much the\r\nbetter for a narrative.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s fame had spread to an awkward extent\r\nbefore he left home. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is bad when your fame outruns your means,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Spanish Jesuit Gracian. At the age of six he had asked a\r\nScripture riddle: \xe2\x80\x9cWho was the first man known to wear breeches?\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\napplause had resounded from the very verge of the heath. At seven he\r\npainted the Battle of Waterloo with tiger-lily pollen and black-currant\r\njuice, in the absence of water-colours. By the time he reached twelve\r\nhe had in this manner been heard of as artist and scholar for at least\r\ntwo miles round. An individual whose fame spreads three or four\r\nthousand yards in the time taken by the fame of others similarly\r\nsituated to travel six or eight hundred, must of necessity have\r\nsomething in him. Possibly Clym\xe2\x80\x99s fame, like Homer\xe2\x80\x99s, owed something to\r\nthe accidents of his situation; nevertheless famous he was.\r\n\r\nHe grew up and was helped out in life. That waggery of fate which\r\nstarted Clive as a writing clerk, Gay as a linen-draper, Keats as a\r\nsurgeon, and a thousand others in a thousand other odd ways, banished\r\nthe wild and ascetic heath lad to a trade whose sole concern was with\r\nthe especial symbols of self-indulgence and vainglory.\r\n\r\nThe details of this choice of a business for him it is not necessary to\r\ngive. At the death of his father a neighbouring gentleman had kindly\r\nundertaken to give the boy a start, and this assumed the form of\r\nsending him to Budmouth. Yeobright did not wish to go there, but it was\r\nthe only feasible opening. Thence he went to London; and thence,\r\nshortly after, to Paris, where he had remained till now.\r\n\r\nSomething being expected of him, he had not been at home many days\r\nbefore a great curiosity as to why he stayed on so long began to arise\r\nin the heath. The natural term of a holiday had passed, yet he still\r\nremained. On the Sunday morning following the week of Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmarriage a discussion on this subject was in progress at a hair-cutting\r\nbefore Fairway\xe2\x80\x99s house. Here the local barbering was always done at\r\nthis hour on this day, to be followed by the great Sunday wash of the\r\ninhabitants at noon, which in its turn was followed by the great Sunday\r\ndressing an hour later. On Egdon Heath Sunday proper did not begin till\r\ndinner-time, and even then it was a somewhat battered specimen of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThese Sunday-morning hair-cuttings were performed by Fairway; the\r\nvictim sitting on a chopping-block in front of the house, without a\r\ncoat, and the neighbours gossiping around, idly observing the locks of\r\nhair as they rose upon the wind after the snip, and flew away out of\r\nsight to the four quarters of the heavens. Summer and winter the scene\r\nwas the same, unless the wind were more than usually blusterous, when\r\nthe stool was shifted a few feet round the corner. To complain of cold\r\nin sitting out of doors, hatless and coatless, while Fairway told true\r\nstories between the cuts of the scissors, would have been to pronounce\r\nyourself no man at once. To flinch, exclaim, or move a muscle of the\r\nface at the small stabs under the ear received from those instruments,\r\nor at scarifications of the neck by the comb, would have been thought a\r\ngross breach of good manners, considering that Fairway did it all for\r\nnothing. A bleeding about the poll on Sunday afternoons was amply\r\naccounted for by the explanation. \xe2\x80\x9cI have had my hair cut, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe conversation on Yeobright had been started by a distant view of the\r\nyoung man rambling leisurely across the heath before them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man who is doing well elsewhere wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bide here two or three\r\nweeks for nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got some project in \xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead\xe2\x80\x94depend upon that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, \xe2\x80\x99a can\xe2\x80\x99t keep a diment shop here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why he should have had them two heavy boxes home if he had\r\nnot been going to bide; and what there is for him to do here the Lord\r\nin heaven knows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore many more surmises could be indulged in Yeobright had come near;\r\nand seeing the hair-cutting group he turned aside to join them.\r\nMarching up, and looking critically at their faces for a moment, he\r\nsaid, without introduction, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, folks, let me guess what you have\r\nbeen talking about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, sure, if you will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, it is a thing I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have dreamed of doing, otherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nFairway in a tone of integrity; \xe2\x80\x9cbut since you have named it, Master\r\nYeobright, I\xe2\x80\x99ll own that we was talking about \xe2\x80\x99ee. We were wondering\r\nwhat could keep you home here mollyhorning about when you have made\r\nsuch a world-wide name for yourself in the nick-nack trade\xe2\x80\x94now, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe truth o\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yeobright with unexpected earnestness. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not\r\nsorry to have the opportunity. I\xe2\x80\x99ve come home because, all things\r\nconsidered, I can be a trifle less useless here than anywhere else. But\r\nI have only lately found this out. When I first got away from home I\r\nthought this place was not worth troubling about. I thought our life\r\nhere was contemptible. To oil your boots instead of blacking them, to\r\ndust your coat with a switch instead of a brush\xe2\x80\x94was there ever anything\r\nmore ridiculous? I said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo \xe2\x80\x99tis; so \xe2\x80\x99tis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no\xe2\x80\x94you are wrong; it isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeg your pardon, we thought that was your maning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, as my views changed my course became very depressing. I found\r\nthat I was trying to be like people who had hardly anything in common\r\nwith myself. I was endeavouring to put off one sort of life for another\r\nsort of life, which was not better than the life I had known before. It\r\nwas simply different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue; a sight different,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Paris must be a taking place,\xe2\x80\x9d said Humphrey. \xe2\x80\x9cGrand\r\nshop-winders, trumpets, and drums; and here be we out of doors in all\r\nwinds and weathers\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you mistake me,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Clym. \xe2\x80\x9cAll this was very depressing. But\r\nnot so depressing as something I next perceived\xe2\x80\x94that my business was\r\nthe idlest, vainest, most effeminate business that ever a man could be\r\nput to. That decided me\xe2\x80\x94I would give it up and try to follow some\r\nrational occupation among the people I knew best, and to whom I could\r\nbe of most use. I have come home; and this is how I mean to carry out\r\nmy plan. I shall keep a school as near to Egdon as possible, so as to\r\nbe able to walk over here and have a night-school in my mother\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\nBut I must study a little at first, to get properly qualified. Now,\r\nneighbours, I must go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Clym resumed his walk across the heath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll never carry it out in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway. \xe2\x80\x9cIn a few weeks\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll learn to see things otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis good-hearted of the young man,\xe2\x80\x9d said another. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, for my part,\r\nI think he had better mind his business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\nThe New Course Causes Disappointment\r\n\r\n\r\nYeobright loved his kind. He had a conviction that the want of most men\r\nwas knowledge of a sort which brings wisdom rather than affluence. He\r\nwished to raise the class at the expense of individuals rather than\r\nindividuals at the expense of the class. What was more, he was ready at\r\nonce to be the first unit sacrificed.\r\n\r\nIn passing from the bucolic to the intellectual life the intermediate\r\nstages are usually two at least, frequently many more; and one of those\r\nstages is almost sure to be worldly advanced. We can hardly imagine\r\nbucolic placidity quickening to intellectual aims without imagining\r\nsocial aims as the transitional phase. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s local peculiarity\r\nwas that in striving at high thinking he still cleaved to plain\r\nliving\xe2\x80\x94nay, wild and meagre living in many respects, and brotherliness\r\nwith clowns.\r\n\r\nHe was a John the Baptist who took ennoblement rather than repentance\r\nfor his text. Mentally he was in a provincial future, that is, he was\r\nin many points abreast with the central town thinkers of his date. Much\r\nof this development he may have owed to his studious life in Paris,\r\nwhere he had become acquainted with ethical systems popular at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this relatively advanced position, Yeobright might\r\nhave been called unfortunate. The rural world was not ripe for him. A\r\nman should be only partially before his time\xe2\x80\x94to be completely to the\r\nvanward in aspirations is fatal to fame. Had Philip\xe2\x80\x99s warlike son been\r\nintellectually so far ahead as to have attempted civilization without\r\nbloodshed, he would have been twice the godlike hero that he seemed,\r\nbut nobody would have heard of an Alexander.\r\n\r\nIn the interests of renown the forwardness should lie chiefly in the\r\ncapacity to handle things. Successful propagandists have succeeded\r\nbecause the doctrine they bring into form is that which their listeners\r\nhave for some time felt without being able to shape. A man who\r\nadvocates \xc3\xa6sthetic effort and deprecates social effort is only likely\r\nto be understood by a class to which social effort has become a stale\r\nmatter. To argue upon the possibility of culture before luxury to the\r\nbucolic world may be to argue truly, but it is an attempt to disturb a\r\nsequence to which humanity has been long accustomed. Yeobright\r\npreaching to the Egdon eremites that they might rise to a serene\r\ncomprehensiveness without going through the process of enriching\r\nthemselves was not unlike arguing to ancient Chaldeans that in\r\nascending from earth to the pure empyrean it was not necessary to pass\r\nfirst into the intervening heaven of ether.\r\n\r\nWas Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s mind well-proportioned? No. A well proportioned mind is\r\none which shows no particular bias; one of which we may safely say that\r\nit will never cause its owner to be confined as a madman, tortured as a\r\nheretic, or crucified as a blasphemer. Also, on the other hand, that it\r\nwill never cause him to be applauded as a prophet, revered as a priest,\r\nor exalted as a king. Its usual blessings are happiness and mediocrity.\r\nIt produces the poetry of Rogers, the paintings of West, the statecraft\r\nof North, the spiritual guidance of Tomline; enabling its possessors to\r\nfind their way to wealth, to wind up well, to step with dignity off the\r\nstage, to die comfortably in their beds, and to get the decent monument\r\nwhich, in many cases, they deserve. It never would have allowed\r\nYeobright to do such a ridiculous thing as throw up his business to\r\nbenefit his fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nHe walked along towards home without attending to paths. If anyone knew\r\nthe heath well it was Clym. He was permeated with its scenes, with its\r\nsubstance, and with its odours. He might be said to be its product. His\r\neyes had first opened thereon; with its appearance all the first images\r\nof his memory were mingled, his estimate of life had been coloured by\r\nit: his toys had been the flint knives and arrow-heads which he found\r\nthere, wondering why stones should \xe2\x80\x9cgrow\xe2\x80\x9d to such odd shapes; his\r\nflowers, the purple bells and yellow furze: his animal kingdom, the\r\nsnakes and croppers; his society, its human haunters. Take all the\r\nvarying hates felt by Eustacia Vye towards the heath, and translate\r\nthem into loves, and you have the heart of Clym. He gazed upon the wide\r\nprospect as he walked, and was glad.\r\n\r\nTo many persons this Egdon was a place which had slipped out of its\r\ncentury generations ago, to intrude as an uncouth object into this. It\r\nwas an obsolete thing, and few cared to study it. How could this be\r\notherwise in the days of square fields, plashed hedges, and meadows\r\nwatered on a plan so rectangular that on a fine day they looked like\r\nsilver gridirons? The farmer, in his ride, who could smile at\r\nartificial grasses, look with solicitude at the coming corn, and sigh\r\nwith sadness at the fly-eaten turnips, bestowed upon the distant upland\r\nof heath nothing better than a frown. But as for Yeobright, when he\r\nlooked from the heights on his way he could not help indulging in a\r\nbarbarous satisfaction at observing that, in some of the attempts at\r\nreclamation from the waste, tillage, after holding on for a year or\r\ntwo, had receded again in despair, the ferns and furze-tufts stubbornly\r\nreasserting themselves.\r\n\r\nHe descended into the valley, and soon reached his home at Blooms-End.\r\nHis mother was snipping dead leaves from the window-plants. She looked\r\nup at him as if she did not understand the meaning of his long stay\r\nwith her; her face had worn that look for several days. He could\r\nperceive that the curiosity which had been shown by the hair-cutting\r\ngroup amounted in his mother to concern. But she had asked no question\r\nwith her lips, even when the arrival of his trunk suggested that he was\r\nnot going to leave her soon. Her silence besought an explanation of him\r\nmore loudly than words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not going back to Paris again, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least, in my\r\nold capacity. I have given up the business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Yeobright turned in pained surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought something was\r\namiss, because of the boxes. I wonder you did not tell me sooner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have done it. But I have been in doubt whether you would be\r\npleased with my plan. I was not quite clear on a few points myself. I\r\nam going to take an entirely new course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am astonished, Clym. How can you want to do better than you\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\ndoing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery easily. But I shall not do better in the way you mean; I suppose\r\nit will be called doing worse. But I hate that business of mine, and I\r\nwant to do some worthy thing before I die. As a schoolmaster I think to\r\ndo it\xe2\x80\x94a school-master to the poor and ignorant, to teach them what\r\nnobody else will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all the trouble that has been taken to give you a start, and\r\nwhen there is nothing to do but to keep straight on towards affluence,\r\nyou say you will be a poor man\xe2\x80\x99s schoolmaster. Your fancies will be\r\nyour ruin, Clym.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Yeobright spoke calmly, but the force of feeling behind the words\r\nwas but too apparent to one who knew her as well as her son did. He did\r\nnot answer. There was in his face that hopelessness of being understood\r\nwhich comes when the objector is constitutionally beyond the reach of a\r\nlogic that, even under favouring conditions, is almost too coarse a\r\nvehicle for the subtlety of the argument.\r\n\r\nNo more was said on the subject till the end of dinner. His mother then\r\nbegan, as if there had been no interval since the morning. \xe2\x80\x9cIt disturbs\r\nme, Clym, to find that you have come home with such thoughts as those.\r\nI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the least idea that you meant to go backward in the world by\r\nyour own free choice. Of course, I have always supposed you were going\r\nto push straight on, as other men do\xe2\x80\x94all who deserve the name\xe2\x80\x94when they\r\nhave been put in a good way of doing well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot help it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym, in a troubled tone. \xe2\x80\x9cMother, I hate the\r\nflashy business. Talk about men who deserve the name, can any man\r\ndeserving the name waste his time in that effeminate way, when he sees\r\nhalf the world going to ruin for want of somebody to buckle to and\r\nteach them how to breast the misery they are born to? I get up every\r\nmorning and see the whole creation groaning and travailing in pain, as\r\nSt. Paul says, and yet there am I, trafficking in glittering splendours\r\nwith wealthy women and titled libertines, and pandering to the meanest\r\nvanities\xe2\x80\x94I, who have health and strength enough for anything. I have\r\nbeen troubled in my mind about it all the year, and the end is that I\r\ncannot do it any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t you do it as well as others?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, except that there are many things other people care for\r\nwhich I don\xe2\x80\x99t; and that\xe2\x80\x99s partly why I think I ought to do this. For\r\none thing, my body does not require much of me. I cannot enjoy\r\ndelicacies; good things are wasted upon me. Well, I ought to turn that\r\ndefect to advantage, and by being able to do without what other people\r\nrequire I can spend what such things cost upon anybody else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow, Yeobright, having inherited some of these very instincts from the\r\nwoman before him, could not fail to awaken a reciprocity in her through\r\nher feelings, if not by arguments, disguise it as she might for his\r\ngood. She spoke with less assurance. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet you might have been a\r\nwealthy man if you had only persevered. Manager to that large diamond\r\nestablishment\xe2\x80\x94what better can a man wish for? What a post of trust and\r\nrespect! I suppose you will be like your father; like him, you are\r\ngetting weary of doing well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said her son, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not weary of that, though I am weary of what\r\nyou mean by it. Mother, what is doing well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Yeobright was far too thoughtful a woman to be content with ready\r\ndefinitions, and, like the \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is wisdom?\xe2\x80\x9d of Plato\xe2\x80\x99s Socrates, and\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is truth?\xe2\x80\x9d of Pontius Pilate, Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s burning question\r\nreceived no answer.\r\n\r\nThe silence was broken by the clash of the garden gate, a tap at the\r\ndoor, and its opening. Christian Cantle appeared in the room in his\r\nSunday clothes.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom on Egdon to begin the preface to a story before\r\nabsolutely entering the house, so as to be well in for the body of the\r\nnarrative by the time visitor and visited stood face to face. Christian\r\nhad been saying to them while the door was leaving its latch, \xe2\x80\x9cTo think\r\nthat I, who go from home but once in a while, and hardly then, should\r\nhave been there this morning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis news you have brought us, then, Christian?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, sure, about a witch, and ye must overlook my time o\xe2\x80\x99 day; for,\r\nsays I, \xe2\x80\x98I must go and tell \xe2\x80\x99em, though they won\xe2\x80\x99t have half done\r\ndinner.\xe2\x80\x99 I assure ye it made me shake like a driven leaf. Do ye think\r\nany harm will come o\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning at church we was all standing up, and the pa\xe2\x80\x99son said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let us pray.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 thinks I, \xe2\x80\x98one may as well kneel as stand\xe2\x80\x99; so\r\ndown I went; and, more than that, all the rest were as willing to\r\noblige the man as I. We hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been hard at it for more than a minute\r\nwhen a most terrible screech sounded through church, as if somebody had\r\njust gied up their heart\xe2\x80\x99s blood. All the folk jumped up and then we\r\nfound that Susan Nunsuch had pricked Miss Vye with a long\r\nstocking-needle, as she had threatened to do as soon as ever she could\r\nget the young lady to church, where she don\xe2\x80\x99t come very often. She\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nwaited for this chance for weeks, so as to draw her blood and put an\r\nend to the bewitching of Susan\xe2\x80\x99s children that has been carried on so\r\nlong. Sue followed her into church, sat next to her, and as soon as she\r\ncould find a chance in went the stocking-needle into my lady\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heaven, how horrid!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSue pricked her that deep that the maid fainted away; and as I was\r\nafeard there might be some tumult among us, I got behind the bass viol\r\nand didn\xe2\x80\x99t see no more. But they carried her out into the air, \xe2\x80\x99tis\r\nsaid; but when they looked round for Sue she was gone. What a scream\r\nthat girl gied, poor thing! There were the pa\xe2\x80\x99son in his surplice\r\nholding up his hand and saying, \xe2\x80\x98Sit down, my good people, sit down!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBut the deuce a bit would they sit down. O, and what d\xe2\x80\x99ye think I found\r\nout, Mrs. Yeobright? The pa\xe2\x80\x99son wears a suit of clothes under his\r\nsurplice!\xe2\x80\x94I could see his black sleeves when he held up his arm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a cruel thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yeobright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe nation ought to look into it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christian. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s Humphrey\r\ncoming, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn came Humphrey. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, have ye heard the news? But I see you have.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis a very strange thing that whenever one of Egdon folk goes to\r\nchurch some rum job or other is sure to be doing. The last time one of\r\nus was there was when neighbour Fairway went in the fall; and that was\r\nthe day you forbad the banns, Mrs. Yeobright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas this cruelly treated girl been able to walk home?\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say she got better, and went home very well. And now I\xe2\x80\x99ve told it\r\nI must be moving homeward myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Humphrey. \xe2\x80\x9cTruly now we shall see if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything in\r\nwhat folks say about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they were gone into the heath again Yeobright said quietly to his\r\nmother, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I have turned teacher too soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is right that there should be schoolmasters, and missionaries, and\r\nall such men,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it is right, too, that I should try to\r\nlift you out of this life into something richer, and that you should\r\nnot come back again, and be as if I had not tried at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLater in the day Sam, the turf-cutter, entered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve come a-borrowing,\r\nMrs. Yeobright. I suppose you have heard what\xe2\x80\x99s been happening to the\r\nbeauty on the hill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sam: half a dozen have been telling us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeauty?\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, tolerably well-favoured,\xe2\x80\x9d Sam replied. \xe2\x80\x9cLord! all the country\r\nowns that \xe2\x80\x99tis one of the strangest things in the world that such a\r\nwoman should have come to live up there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDark or fair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, though I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her twenty times, that\xe2\x80\x99s a thing I cannot call\r\nto mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDarker than Tamsin,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mrs. Yeobright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman who seems to care for nothing at all, as you may say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is melancholy, then?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Clym.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe mopes about by herself, and don\xe2\x80\x99t mix in with the people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she a young lady inclined for adventures?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to my knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t join in with the lads in their games, to get some sort of\r\nexcitement in this lonely place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMumming, for instance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Her notions be different. I should rather say her thoughts were\r\nfar away from here, with lords and ladies she\xe2\x80\x99ll never know, and\r\nmansions she\xe2\x80\x99ll never see again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nObserving that Clym appeared singularly interested Mrs. Yeobright said\r\nrather uneasily to Sam, \xe2\x80\x9cYou see more in her than most of us do. Miss\r\nVye is to my mind too idle to be charming. I have never heard that she\r\nis of any use to herself or to other people. Good girls don\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\ntreated as witches even on Egdon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense\xe2\x80\x94that proves nothing either way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yeobright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand such niceties,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam,\r\nwithdrawing from a possibly unpleasant argument; \xe2\x80\x9cand what she is we\r\nmust wait for time to tell us. The business that I have really called\r\nabout is this, to borrow the longest and strongest rope you have. The\r\ncaptain\xe2\x80\x99s bucket has dropped into the well, and they are in want of\r\nwater; and as all the chaps are at home today we think we can get it\r\nout for him. We have three cart-ropes already, but they won\xe2\x80\x99t reach to\r\nthe bottom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Yeobright told him that he might have whatever ropes he could find\r\nin the outhouse, and Sam went out to search. When he passed by the door\r\nClym joined him, and accompanied him to the gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this young witch-lady going to stay long at Mistover?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a cruel shame to ill-use her, She must have suffered greatly\xe2\x80\x94more\r\nin mind than in body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas a graceless trick\xe2\x80\x94such a handsome girl, too. You ought to see\r\nher, Mr. Yeobright, being a young man come from far, and with a little\r\nmore to show for your years than most of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think she would like to teach children?\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym.\r\n\r\nSam shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cQuite a different sort of body from that, I\r\nreckon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, it was merely something which occurred to me. It would of course be\r\nnecessary to see her and talk it over\xe2\x80\x94not an easy thing, by the way,\r\nfor my family and hers are not very friendly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how you mid see her, Mr. Yeobright,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are\r\ngoing to grapple for the bucket at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock tonight at her house,\r\nand you could lend a hand. There\xe2\x80\x99s five or six coming, but the well is\r\ndeep, and another might be useful, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind appearing in that\r\nshape. She\xe2\x80\x99s sure to be walking round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll think of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yeobright; and they parted.\r\n\r\nHe thought of it a good deal; but nothing more was said about Eustacia\r\ninside the house at that time. Whether this romantic martyr to\r\nsuperstition and the melancholy mummer he had conversed with under the\r\nfull moon were one and the same person remained as yet a problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nThe First Act in a Timeworn Drama\r\n\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was fine, and Yeobright walked on the heath for an hour\r\nwith his mother. When they reached the lofty ridge which divided the\r\nvalley of Blooms-End from the adjoining valley they stood still and\r\nlooked round. The Quiet Woman Inn was visible on the low margin of the\r\nheath in one direction, and afar on the other hand rose Mistover Knap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean to call on Thomasin?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. But you need not come this time,\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case I\xe2\x80\x99ll branch off here, Mother. I am going to Mistover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Yeobright turned to him inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to help them get the bucket out of the captain\xe2\x80\x99s well,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued. \xe2\x80\x9cAs it is so very deep I may be useful. And I should like to\r\nsee this Miss Vye\xe2\x80\x94not so much for her good looks as for another\r\nreason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust you go?\xe2\x80\x9d his mother asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they parted. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no help for it,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Clym\xe2\x80\x99s mother\r\ngloomily as he withdrew. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are sure to see each other. I wish Sam\r\nwould carry his news to other houses than mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClym\xe2\x80\x99s retreating figure got smaller and smaller as it rose and fell\r\nover the hillocks on his way. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is tender-hearted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nYeobright to herself while she watched him; \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise it would matter\r\nlittle. How he\xe2\x80\x99s going on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was, indeed, walking with a will over the furze, as straight as a\r\nline, as if his life depended upon it. His mother drew a long breath,\r\nand, abandoning the visit to Thomasin, turned back. The evening films\r\nbegan to make nebulous pictures of the valleys, but the high lands\r\nstill were raked by the declining rays of the winter sun, which glanced\r\non Clym as he walked forward, eyed by every rabbit and field-fare\r\naround, a long shadow advancing in front of him.\r\n\r\nOn drawing near to the furze-covered bank and ditch which fortified the\r\ncaptain\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling he could hear voices within, signifying that\r\noperations had been already begun. At the side-entrance gate he stopped\r\nand looked over.\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen able-bodied men were standing in a line from the\r\nwell-mouth, holding a rope which passed over the well-roller into the\r\ndepths below. Fairway, with a piece of smaller rope round his body,\r\nmade fast to one of the standards, to guard against accidents, was\r\nleaning over the opening, his right hand clasping the vertical rope\r\nthat descended into the well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, silence, folks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway.\r\n\r\nThe talking ceased, and Fairway gave a circular motion to the rope, as\r\nif he were stirring batter. At the end of a minute a dull splashing\r\nreverberated from the bottom of the well; the helical twist he had\r\nimparted to the rope had reached the grapnel below.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaul!\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway; and the men who held the rope began to gather it\r\nover the wheel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we\xe2\x80\x99ve got sommat,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the haulers-in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen pull steady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway.\r\n\r\nThey gathered up more and more, till a regular dripping into the well\r\ncould be heard below. It grew smarter with the increasing height of the\r\nbucket, and presently a hundred and fifty feet of rope had been pulled\r\nin.\r\n\r\nFairway then lit a lantern, tied it to another cord, and began lowering\r\nit into the well beside the first: Clym came forward and looked down.\r\nStrange humid leaves, which knew nothing of the seasons of the year,\r\nand quaint-natured mosses were revealed on the wellside as the lantern\r\ndescended; till its rays fell upon a confused mass of rope and bucket\r\ndangling in the dank, dark air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve only got en by the edge of the hoop\xe2\x80\x94steady, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Fairway.\r\n\r\nThey pulled with the greatest gentleness, till the wet bucket appeared\r\nabout two yards below them, like a dead friend come to earth again.\r\nThree or four hands were stretched out, then jerk went the rope, whizz\r\nwent the wheel, the two foremost haulers fell backward, the beating of\r\na falling body was heard, receding down the sides of the well, and a\r\nthunderous uproar arose at the bottom. The bucket was gone again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn the bucket!\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLower again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m as stiff as a ram\xe2\x80\x99s horn stooping so long,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway, standing\r\nup and stretching himself till his joints creaked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRest a few minutes, Timothy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yeobright. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take your place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe grapnel was again lowered. Its smart impact upon the distant water\r\nreached their ears like a kiss, whereupon Yeobright knelt down, and\r\nleaning over the well began dragging the grapnel round and round as\r\nFairway had done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTie a rope round him\xe2\x80\x94it is dangerous!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a soft and anxious voice\r\nsomewhere above them.\r\n\r\nEverybody turned. The speaker was a woman, gazing down upon the group\r\nfrom an upper window, whose panes blazed in the ruddy glare from the\r\nwest. Her lips were parted and she appeared for the moment to forget\r\nwhere she was.\r\n\r\nThe rope was accordingly tied round his waist, and the work proceeded.\r\nAt the next haul the weight was not heavy, and it was discovered that\r\nthey had only secured a coil of the rope detached from the bucket. The\r\ntangled mass was thrown into the background. Humphrey took Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplace, and the grapnel was lowered again.\r\n\r\nYeobright retired to the heap of recovered rope in a meditative mood.\r\nOf the identity between the lady\xe2\x80\x99s voice and that of the melancholy\r\nmummer he had not a moment\xe2\x80\x99s doubt. \xe2\x80\x9cHow thoughtful of her!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nEustacia, who had reddened when she perceived the effect of her\r\nexclamation upon the group below, was no longer to be seen at the\r\nwindow, though Yeobright scanned it wistfully. While he stood there the\r\nmen at the well succeeded in getting up the bucket without a mishap.\r\nOne of them went to inquire for the captain, to learn what orders he\r\nwished to give for mending the well-tackle. The captain proved to be\r\naway from home, and Eustacia appeared at the door and came out. She had\r\nlapsed into an easy and dignified calm, far removed from the intensity\r\nof life in her words of solicitude for Clym\xe2\x80\x99s safety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill it be possible to draw water here tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, miss; the bottom of the bucket is clean knocked out. And as we can\r\ndo no more now we\xe2\x80\x99ll leave off, and come again tomorrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo water,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, turning away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can send you up some from Blooms-End,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym, coming forward and\r\nraising his hat as the men retired.\r\n\r\nYeobright and Eustacia looked at each other for one instant, as if each\r\nhad in mind those few moments during which a certain moonlight scene\r\nwas common to both. With the glance the calm fixity of her features\r\nsublimed itself to an expression of refinement and warmth; it was like\r\ngarish noon rising to the dignity of sunset in a couple of seconds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you; it will hardly be necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you have no water?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is what I call no water,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, blushing, and lifting her\r\nlong-lashed eyelids as if to lift them were a work requiring\r\nconsideration. \xe2\x80\x9cBut my grandfather calls it water enough. I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you\r\nwhat I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe moved away a few yards, and Clym followed. When she reached the\r\ncorner of the enclosure, where the steps were formed for mounting the\r\nboundary bank, she sprang up with a lightness which seemed strange\r\nafter her listless movement towards the well. It incidentally showed\r\nthat her apparent languor did not arise from lack of force.\r\n\r\nClym ascended behind her, and noticed a circular burnt patch at the top\r\nof the bank. \xe2\x80\x9cAshes?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had a little bonfire here last Fifth of\r\nNovember, and those are the marks of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn that spot had stood the fire she had kindled to attract Wildeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the only kind of water we have,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, tossing a stone\r\ninto the pool, which lay on the outside of the bank like the white of\r\nan eye without its pupil. The stone fell with a flounce, but no Wildeve\r\nappeared on the other side, as on a previous occasion there. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\ngrandfather says he lived for more than twenty years at sea on water\r\ntwice as bad as that,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cand considers it quite good enough\r\nfor us here on an emergency.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, as a matter of fact there are no impurities in the water of\r\nthese pools at this time of the year. It has only just rained into\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI am managing to exist in a wilderness, but I\r\ncannot drink from a pond,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nClym looked towards the well, which was now deserted, the men having\r\ngone home. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a long way to send for spring-water,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after\r\na silence. \xe2\x80\x9cBut since you don\xe2\x80\x99t like this in the pond, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get\r\nyou some myself.\xe2\x80\x9d He went back to the well. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think I could do it\r\nby tying on this pail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, since I would not trouble the men to get it, I cannot in\r\nconscience let you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the trouble at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made fast the pail to the long coil of rope, put it over the wheel,\r\nand allowed it to descend by letting the rope slip through his hands.\r\nBefore it had gone far, however, he checked it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must make fast the end first, or we may lose the whole,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to\r\nEustacia, who had drawn near. \xe2\x80\x9cCould you hold this a moment, while I do\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94or shall I call your servant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can hold it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia; and he placed the rope in her hands,\r\ngoing then to search for the end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I may let it slip down?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would advise you not to let it go far,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will get much\r\nheavier, you will find.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever, Eustacia had begun to pay out. While he was tying she cried,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot stop it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClym ran to her side, and found he could only check the rope by\r\ntwisting the loose part round the upright post, when it stopped with a\r\njerk. \xe2\x80\x9cHas it hurt you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I think not.\xe2\x80\x9d She opened her hands. One of them was bleeding; the\r\nrope had dragged off the skin. Eustacia wrapped it in her handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have let go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yeobright. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said I was to hold on.... This is the second time I have been\r\nwounded today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes; I have heard of it. I blush for my native Egdon. Was it a\r\nserious injury you received in church, Miss Vye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was such an abundance of sympathy in Clym\xe2\x80\x99s tone that Eustacia\r\nslowly drew up her sleeve and disclosed her round white arm. A bright\r\nred spot appeared on its smooth surface, like a ruby on Parian marble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, putting her finger against the spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was dastardly of the woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym. \xe2\x80\x9cWill not Captain Vye get\r\nher punished?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is gone from home on that very business. I did not know that I had\r\nsuch a magic reputation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you fainted?\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym, looking at the scarlet little puncture as\r\nif he would like to kiss it and make it well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it frightened me. I had not been to church for a long time. And\r\nnow I shall not go again for ever so long\xe2\x80\x94perhaps never. I cannot face\r\ntheir eyes after this. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it dreadfully humiliating? I\r\nwished I was dead for hours after, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come to clean away these cobwebs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yeobright. \xe2\x80\x9cWould you\r\nlike to help me\xe2\x80\x94by high-class teaching? We might benefit them much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite feel anxious to. I have not much love for my\r\nfellow-creatures. Sometimes I quite hate them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill I think that if you were to hear my scheme you might take an\r\ninterest in it. There is no use in hating people\xe2\x80\x94if you hate anything,\r\nyou should hate what produced them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean Nature? I hate her already. But I shall be glad to hear\r\nyour scheme at any time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe situation had now worked itself out, and the next natural thing was\r\nfor them to part. Clym knew this well enough, and Eustacia made a move\r\nof conclusion; yet he looked at her as if he had one word more to say.\r\nPerhaps if he had not lived in Paris it would never have been uttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have met before,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, regarding her with rather more interest\r\nthan was necessary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not own it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia, with a repressed, still look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I may think what I like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are lonely here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot endure the heath, except in its purple season. The heath is a\r\ncruel taskmaster to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you say so?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cTo my mind it is most exhilarating, and\r\nstrengthening, and soothing. I would rather live on these hills than\r\nanywhere else in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well enough for artists; but I never would learn to draw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there is a very curious druidical stone just out there.\xe2\x80\x9d He threw\r\na pebble in the direction signified. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you often go to see it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was not even aware there existed any such curious druidical stone. I\r\nam aware that there are boulevards in Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYeobright looked thoughtfully on the ground. \xe2\x80\x9cThat means much,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember when I had the same longing for town bustle. Five years of\r\na great city would be a perfect cure for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven send me such a cure! Now, Mr. Yeobright, I will go indoors and\r\nplaster my wounded hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey separated, and Eustacia vanished in the increasing shade. She\r\nseemed full of many things. Her past was a blank, her life had begun.\r\nThe effect upon Clym of this meeting he did not fully discover till\r\nsome time after. During his walk home his most intelligible sensation\r\nwas that his scheme had somehow become glorified. A beautiful woman had\r\nbeen intertwined with it.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the house he went up to the room which was to be made his\r\nstudy, and occupied himself during the evening in unpacking his books\r\nfrom the boxes and arranging them on shelves. From another box he drew\r\na lamp and a can of oil. He trimmed the lamp, arranged his table, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, I am ready to begin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose early the next morning, read two hours before breakfast by the\r\nlight of his lamp\xe2\x80\x94read all the morning, all the afternoon. Just when\r\nthe sun was going down his eyes felt weary, and he leant back in his\r\nchair.\r\n\r\nHis room overlooked the front of the premises and the valley of the\r\nheath beyond. The lowest beams of the winter sun threw the shadow of\r\nthe house over the palings, across the grass margin of the heath, and\r\nfar up the vale, where the chimney outlines and those of the\r\nsurrounding tree-tops stretched forth in long dark prongs. Having been\r\nseated at work all day, he decided to take a turn upon the hills before\r\nit got dark; and, going out forthwith, he struck across the heath\r\ntowards Mistover.\r\n\r\nIt was an hour and a half later when he again appeared at the garden\r\ngate. The shutters of the house were closed, and Christian Cantle, who\r\nhad been wheeling manure about the garden all day, had gone home. On\r\nentering he found that his mother, after waiting a long time for him,\r\nhad finished her meal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you been, Clym?\xe2\x80\x9d she immediately said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell\r\nme that you were going away at this time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been on the heath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll meet Eustacia Vye if you go up there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClym paused a minute. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I met her this evening,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as though\r\nit were spoken under the sheer necessity of preserving honesty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wondered if you had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was no appointment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; such meetings never are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are not angry, Mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can hardly say that I am not. Angry? No. But when I consider the\r\nusual nature of the drag which causes men of promise to disappoint the\r\nworld I feel uneasy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou deserve credit for the feeling, Mother. But I can assure you that\r\nyou need not be disturbed by it on my account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I think of you and your new crotchets,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright, with\r\nsome emphasis, \xe2\x80\x9cI naturally don\xe2\x80\x99t feel so comfortable as I did a\r\ntwelvemonth ago. It is incredible to me that a man accustomed to the\r\nattractive women of Paris and elsewhere should be so easily worked upon\r\nby a girl in a heath. You could just as well have walked another way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had been studying all day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d she added more hopefully, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been thinking that you\r\nmight get on as a schoolmaster, and rise that way, since you really are\r\ndetermined to hate the course you were pursuing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYeobright was unwilling to disturb this idea, though his scheme was far\r\nenough removed from one wherein the education of youth should be made a\r\nmere channel of social ascent. He had no desires of that sort. He had\r\nreached the stage in a young man\xe2\x80\x99s life when the grimness of the\r\ngeneral human situation first becomes clear; and the realization of\r\nthis causes ambition to halt awhile. In France it is not uncustomary to\r\ncommit suicide at this stage; in England we do much better, or much\r\nworse, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nThe love between the young man and his mother was strangely invisible\r\nnow. Of love it may be said, the less earthly the less demonstrative.\r\nIn its absolutely indestructible form it reaches a profundity in which\r\nall exhibition of itself is painful. It was so with these. Had\r\nconversations between them been overheard, people would have said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\ncold they are to each other!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis theory and his wishes about devoting his future to teaching had\r\nmade an impression on Mrs. Yeobright. Indeed, how could it be otherwise\r\nwhen he was a part of her\xe2\x80\x94when their discourses were as if carried on\r\nbetween the right and the left hands of the same body? He had despaired\r\nof reaching her by argument; and it was almost as a discovery to him\r\nthat he could reach her by a magnetism which was as superior to words\r\nas words are to yells.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough he began to feel now that it would not be so hard to\r\npersuade her who was his best friend that comparative poverty was\r\nessentially the higher course for him, as to reconcile to his feelings\r\nthe act of persuading her. From every provident point of view his\r\nmother was so undoubtedly right, that he was not without a sickness of\r\nheart in finding he could shake her.\r\n\r\nShe had a singular insight into life, considering that she had never\r\nmixed with it. There are instances of persons who, without clear ideas\r\nof the things they criticize have yet had clear ideas of the relations\r\nof those things. Blacklock, a poet blind from his birth, could describe\r\nvisual objects with accuracy; Professor Sanderson, who was also blind,\r\ngave excellent lectures on colour, and taught others the theory of\r\nideas which they had and he had not. In the social sphere these gifted\r\nones are mostly women; they can watch a world which they never saw, and\r\nestimate forces of which they have only heard. We call it intuition.\r\n\r\nWhat was the great world to Mrs. Yeobright? A multitude whose\r\ntendencies could be perceived, though not its essences. Communities\r\nwere seen by her as from a distance; she saw them as we see the throngs\r\nwhich cover the canvases of Sallaert, Van Alsloot, and others of that\r\nschool\xe2\x80\x94vast masses of beings, jostling, zigzagging, and processioning\r\nin definite directions, but whose features are indistinguishable by the\r\nvery comprehensiveness of the view.\r\n\r\nOne could see that, as far as it had gone, her life was very complete\r\non its reflective side. The philosophy of her nature, and its\r\nlimitation by circumstances, was almost written in her movements. They\r\nhad a majestic foundation, though they were far from being majestic;\r\nand they had a ground-work of assurance, but they were not assured. As\r\nher once elastic walk had become deadened by time, so had her natural\r\npride of life been hindered in its blooming by her necessities.\r\n\r\nThe next slight touch in the shaping of Clym\xe2\x80\x99s destiny occurred a few\r\ndays after. A barrow was opened on the heath, and Yeobright attended\r\nthe operation, remaining away from his study during several hours. In\r\nthe afternoon Christian returned from a journey in the same direction,\r\nand Mrs. Yeobright questioned him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have dug a hole, and they have found things like flowerpots\r\nupside down, Mis\xe2\x80\x99ess Yeobright; and inside these be real charnel bones.\r\nThey have carried \xe2\x80\x99em off to men\xe2\x80\x99s houses; but I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to\r\nsleep where they will bide. Dead folks have been known to come and\r\nclaim their own. Mr. Yeobright had got one pot of the bones, and was\r\ngoing to bring \xe2\x80\x99em home\xe2\x80\x94real skellington bones\xe2\x80\x94but \xe2\x80\x99twas ordered\r\notherwise. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be relieved to hear that he gave away his pot and\r\nall, on second thoughts; and a blessed thing for ye, Mis\xe2\x80\x99ess Yeobright,\r\nconsidering the wind o\xe2\x80\x99 nights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGave it away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. To Miss Vye. She has a cannibal taste for such churchyard\r\nfurniture seemingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Vye was there too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, \xe2\x80\x99a b\xe2\x80\x99lieve she was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Clym came home, which was shortly after, his mother said, in a\r\ncurious tone, \xe2\x80\x9cThe urn you had meant for me you gave away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYeobright made no reply; the current of her feeling was too pronounced\r\nto admit it.\r\n\r\nThe early weeks of the year passed on. Yeobright certainly studied at\r\nhome, but he also walked much abroad, and the direction of his walk was\r\nalways towards some point of a line between Mistover and Rainbarrow.\r\n\r\nThe month of March arrived, and the heath showed its first signs of\r\nawakening from winter trance. The awakening was almost feline in its\r\nstealthiness. The pool outside the bank by Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling, which\r\nseemed as dead and desolate as ever to an observer who moved and made\r\nnoises in his observation, would gradually disclose a state of great\r\nanimation when silently watched awhile. A timid animal world had come\r\nto life for the season. Little tadpoles and efts began to bubble up\r\nthrough the water, and to race along beneath it; toads made noises like\r\nvery young ducks, and advanced to the margin in twos and threes;\r\noverhead, bumblebees flew hither and thither in the thickening light,\r\ntheir drone coming and going like the sound of a gong.\r\n\r\nOn an evening such as this Yeobright descended into the Blooms-End\r\nvalley from beside that very pool, where he had been standing with\r\nanother person quite silently and quite long enough to hear all this\r\npuny stir of resurrection in nature; yet he had not heard it. His walk\r\nwas rapid as he came down, and he went with a springy trend. Before\r\nentering upon his mother\xe2\x80\x99s premises he stopped and breathed. The light\r\nwhich shone forth on him from the window revealed that his face was\r\nflushed and his eye bright. What it did not show was something which\r\nlingered upon his lips like a seal set there. The abiding presence of\r\nthis impress was so real that he hardly dared to enter the house, for\r\nit seemed as if his mother might say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat red spot is that glowing\r\nupon your mouth so vividly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he entered soon after. The tea was ready, and he sat down opposite\r\nhis mother. She did not speak many words; and as for him, something had\r\nbeen just done and some words had been just said on the hill which\r\nprevented him from beginning a desultory chat. His mother\xe2\x80\x99s taciturnity\r\nwas not without ominousness, but he appeared not to care. He knew why\r\nshe said so little, but he could not remove the cause of her bearing\r\ntowards him. These half-silent sittings were far from uncommon with\r\nthem now. At last Yeobright made a beginning of what was intended to\r\nstrike at the whole root of the matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive days have we sat like this at meals with scarcely a word. What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe use of it, Mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, in a heart-swollen tone. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there is only too good\r\na reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot when you know all. I have been wanting to speak about this, and I\r\nam glad the subject is begun. The reason, of course, is Eustacia Vye.\r\nWell, I confess I have seen her lately, and have seen her a good many\r\ntimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; and I know what that amounts to. It troubles me, Clym. You\r\nare wasting your life here; and it is solely on account of her. If it\r\nhad not been for that woman you would never have entertained this\r\nteaching scheme at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClym looked hard at his mother. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know that is not it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I know you had decided to attempt it before you saw her; but\r\nthat would have ended in intentions. It was very well to talk of, but\r\nridiculous to put in practice. I fully expected that in the course of a\r\nmonth or two you would have seen the folly of such self-sacrifice, and\r\nwould have been by this time back again to Paris in some business or\r\nother. I can understand objections to the diamond trade\xe2\x80\x94I really was\r\nthinking that it might be inadequate to the life of a man like you even\r\nthough it might have made you a millionaire. But now I see how mistaken\r\nyou are about this girl I doubt if you could be correct about other\r\nthings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow am I mistaken in her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is lazy and dissatisfied. But that is not all of it. Supposing her\r\nto be as good a woman as any you can find, which she certainly is not,\r\nwhy do you wish to connect yourself with anybody at present?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there are practical reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d Clym began, and then almost broke\r\noff under an overpowering sense of the weight of argument which could\r\nbe brought against his statement. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I take a school an educated woman\r\nwould be invaluable as a help to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! you really mean to marry her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be premature to state that plainly. But consider what obvious\r\nadvantages there would be in doing it. She\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t suppose she has any money. She hasn\xe2\x80\x99t a farthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is excellently educated, and would make a good matron in a\r\nboarding-school. I candidly own that I have modified my views a little,\r\nin deference to you; and it should satisfy you. I no longer adhere to\r\nmy intention of giving with my own mouth rudimentary education to the\r\nlowest class. I can do better. I can establish a good private school\r\nfor farmers\xe2\x80\x99 sons, and without stopping the school I can manage to pass\r\nexaminations. By this means, and by the assistance of a wife like\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Clym!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall ultimately, I hope, be at the head of one of the best schools\r\nin the county.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYeobright had enunciated the word \xe2\x80\x9cher\xe2\x80\x9d with a fervour which, in\r\nconversation with a mother, was absurdly indiscreet. Hardly a maternal\r\nheart within the four seas could in such circumstances, have helped\r\nbeing irritated at that ill-timed betrayal of feeling for a new woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are blinded, Clym,\xe2\x80\x9d she said warmly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a bad day for you\r\nwhen you first set eyes on her. And your scheme is merely a castle in\r\nthe air built on purpose to justify this folly which has seized you,\r\nand to salve your conscience on the irrational situation you are in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, that\xe2\x80\x99s not true,\xe2\x80\x9d he firmly answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you maintain that I sit and tell untruths, when all I wish to do\r\nis to save you from sorrow? For shame, Clym! But it is all through that\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x94a hussy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClym reddened like fire and rose. He placed his hand upon his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder and said, in a tone which hung strangely between entreaty and\r\ncommand, \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t hear it. I may be led to answer you in a way which we\r\nshall both regret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis mother parted her lips to begin some other vehement truth, but on\r\nlooking at him she saw that in his face which led her to leave the\r\nwords unsaid. Yeobright walked once or twice across the room, and then\r\nsuddenly went out of the house. It was eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock when he came in,\r\nthough he had not been further than the precincts of the garden. His\r\nmother was gone to bed. A light was left burning on the table, and\r\nsupper was spread. Without stopping for any food he secured the doors\r\nand went upstairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nAn Hour of Bliss and Many Hours of Sadness\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day was gloomy enough at Blooms-End. Yeobright remained in his\r\nstudy, sitting over the open books; but the work of those hours was\r\nmiserably scant. Determined that there should be nothing in his conduct\r\ntowards his mother resembling sullenness, he had occasionally spoken to\r\nher on passing matters, and would take no notice of the brevity of her\r\nreplies. With the same resolve to keep up a show of conversation he\r\nsaid, about seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s an eclipse of the\r\nmoon tonight. I am going out to see it.\xe2\x80\x9d And, putting on his overcoat,\r\nhe left her.\r\n\r\nThe low moon was not as yet visible from the front of the house, and\r\nYeobright climbed out of the valley until he stood in the full flood of\r\nher light. But even now he walked on, and his steps were in the\r\ndirection of Rainbarrow.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour he stood at the top. The sky was clear from verge to\r\nverge, and the moon flung her rays over the whole heath, but without\r\nsensibly lighting it, except where paths and water-courses had laid\r\nbare the white flints and glistening quartz sand, which made streaks\r\nupon the general shade. After standing awhile he stooped and felt the\r\nheather. It was dry, and he flung himself down upon the barrow, his\r\nface towards the moon, which depicted a small image of herself in each\r\nof his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe had often come up here without stating his purpose to his mother;\r\nbut this was the first time that he had been ostensibly frank as to his\r\npurpose while really concealing it. It was a moral situation which,\r\nthree months earlier, he could hardly have credited of himself. In\r\nreturning to labour in this sequestered spot he had anticipated an\r\nescape from the chafing of social necessities; yet behold they were\r\nhere also. More than ever he longed to be in some world where personal\r\nambition was not the only recognized form of progress\xe2\x80\x94such, perhaps, as\r\nmight have been the case at some time or other in the silvery globe\r\nthen shining upon him. His eye travelled over the length and breadth of\r\nthat distant country\xe2\x80\x94over the Bay of Rainbows, the sombre Sea of\r\nCrises, the Ocean of Storms, the Lake of Dreams, the vast Walled\r\nPlains, and the wondrous Ring Mountains\xe2\x80\x94till he almost felt himself to\r\nbe voyaging bodily through its wild scenes, standing on its hollow\r\nhills, traversing its deserts, descending its vales and old sea\r\nbottoms, or mounting to the edges of its craters.\r\n\r\nWhile he watched the far-removed landscape a tawny stain grew into\r\nbeing on the lower verge\xe2\x80\x94the eclipse had begun. This marked a\r\npreconcerted moment\xe2\x80\x94for the remote celestial phenomenon had been\r\npressed into sublunary service as a lover\xe2\x80\x99s signal. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s mind\r\nflew back to earth at the sight; he arose, shook himself and listened.\r\nMinute after minute passed by, perhaps ten minutes passed, and the\r\nshadow on the moon perceptibly widened. He heard a rustling on his left\r\nhand, a cloaked figure with an upturned face appeared at the base of\r\nthe Barrow, and Clym descended. In a moment the figure was in his arms,\r\nand his lips upon hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Eustacia!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClym, dearest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch a situation had less than three months brought forth.\r\n\r\nThey remained long without a single utterance, for no language could\r\nreach the level of their condition\xe2\x80\x94words were as the rusty implements\r\nof a by-gone barbarous epoch, and only to be occasionally tolerated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI began to wonder why you did not come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yeobright, when she had\r\nwithdrawn a little from his embrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said ten minutes after the first mark of shade on the edge of the\r\nmoon, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let us only think that here we are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, holding each other\xe2\x80\x99s hand, they were again silent, and the shadow\r\non the moon\xe2\x80\x99s disc grew a little larger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas it seemed long since you last saw me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has seemed sad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not long? That\xe2\x80\x99s because you occupy yourself, and so blind\r\nyourself to my absence. To me, who can do nothing, it has been like\r\nliving under stagnant water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather bear tediousness, dear, than have time made short by\r\nsuch means as have shortened mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what way is that? You have been thinking you wished you did not\r\nlove me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can a man wish that, and yet love on? No, Eustacia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMen can, women cannot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, whatever I may have thought, one thing is certain\xe2\x80\x94I do love\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94past all compass and description. I love you to oppressiveness\xe2\x80\x94I,\r\nwho have never before felt more than a pleasant passing fancy for any\r\nwoman I have ever seen. Let me look right into your moonlit face and\r\ndwell on every line and curve in it! Only a few hairbreadths make the\r\ndifference between this face and faces I have seen many times before I\r\nknew you; yet what a difference\xe2\x80\x94the difference between everything and\r\nnothing at all. One touch on that mouth again! there, and there, and\r\nthere. Your eyes seem heavy, Eustacia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is my general way of looking. I think it arises from my feeling\r\nsometimes an agonizing pity for myself that I ever was born.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t feel it now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Yet I know that we shall not love like this always. Nothing can\r\nensure the continuance of love. It will evaporate like a spirit, and so\r\nI feel full of fears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know. You have seen more than I, and have been into\r\ncities and among people that I have only heard of, and have lived more\r\nyears than I; but yet I am older at this than you. I loved another man\r\nonce, and now I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn God\xe2\x80\x99s mercy don\xe2\x80\x99t talk so, Eustacia!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I do not think I shall be the one who wearies first. It will, I\r\nfear, end in this way: your mother will find out that you meet me, and\r\nshe will influence you against me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat can never be. She knows of these meetings already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she speaks against me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, go away! Obey her. I shall ruin you. It is foolish of you to\r\nmeet me like this. Kiss me, and go away forever. Forever\xe2\x80\x94do you\r\nhear?\xe2\x80\x94forever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is your only chance. Many a man\xe2\x80\x99s love has been a curse to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are desperate, full of fancies, and wilful; and you misunderstand.\r\nI have an additional reason for seeing you tonight besides love of you.\r\nFor though, unlike you, I feel our affection may be eternal. I feel\r\nwith you in this, that our present mode of existence cannot last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! \xe2\x80\x99tis your mother. Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s it! I knew it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind what it is. Believe this, I cannot let myself lose you. I\r\nmust have you always with me. This very evening I do not like to let\r\nyou go. There is only one cure for this anxiety, dearest\xe2\x80\x94you must be my\r\nwife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe started\xe2\x80\x94then endeavoured to say calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cCynics say that cures the\r\nanxiety by curing the love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must answer me. Shall I claim you some day\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean at\r\nonce?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must think,\xe2\x80\x9d Eustacia murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cAt present speak of Paris to me. Is\r\nthere any place like it on earth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very beautiful. But will you be mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will be nobody else\xe2\x80\x99s in the world\xe2\x80\x94does that satisfy you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, for the present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow tell me of the Tuileries, and the Louvre,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued\r\nevasively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate talking of Paris! Well, I remember one sunny room in the Louvre\r\nwhich would make a fitting place for you to live in\xe2\x80\x94the Galerie\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Apollon. Its windows are mainly east; and in the early morning, when\r\nthe sun is bright, the whole apartment is in a perfect blaze of\r\nsplendour. The rays bristle and dart from the encrustations of gilding\r\nto the magnificent inlaid coffers, from the coffers to the gold and\r\nsilver plate, from the plate to the jewels and precious stones, from\r\nthese to the enamels, till there is a perfect network of light which\r\nquite dazzles the eye. But now, about our marriage\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Versailles\xe2\x80\x94the King\xe2\x80\x99s Gallery is some such gorgeous room, is it\r\nnot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. But what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of talking of gorgeous rooms? By the way, the\r\nLittle Trianon would suit us beautifully to live in, and you might walk\r\nin the gardens in the moonlight and think you were in some English\r\nshrubbery; it is laid out in English fashion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should hate to think that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you could keep to the lawn in front of the Grand Palace. All\r\nabout there you would doubtless feel in a world of historical romance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went on, since it was all new to her, and described Fontainebleau,\r\nSt. Cloud, the Bois, and many other familiar haunts of the Parisians;\r\ntill she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen used you to go to these places?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn Sundays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes. I dislike English Sundays. How I should chime in with their\r\nmanners over there! Dear Clym, you\xe2\x80\x99ll go back again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClym shook his head, and looked at the eclipse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ll go back again I\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\x94be something,\xe2\x80\x9d she said tenderly, putting\r\nher head near his breast. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ll agree I\xe2\x80\x99ll give my promise,\r\nwithout making you wait a minute longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow extraordinary that you and my mother should be of one mind about\r\nthis!\xe2\x80\x9d said Yeobright. \xe2\x80\x9cI have vowed not to go back, Eustacia. It is\r\nnot the place I dislike; it is the occupation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can go in some other capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Besides, it would interfere with my scheme. Don\xe2\x80\x99t press that,\r\nEustacia. Will you marry me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow\xe2\x80\x94never mind Paris; it is no better than other spots. Promise,\r\nsweet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will never adhere to your education plan, I am quite sure; and\r\nthen it will be all right for me; and so I promise to be yours for ever\r\nand ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClym brought her face towards his by a gentle pressure of the hand, and\r\nkissed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! but you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you have got in me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes\r\nI think there is not that in Eustacia Vye which will make a good\r\nhomespun wife. Well, let it go\xe2\x80\x94see how our time is slipping, slipping,\r\nslipping!\xe2\x80\x9d She pointed towards the half-eclipsed moon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are too mournful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Only I dread to think of anything beyond the present. What is, we\r\nknow. We are together now, and it is unknown how long we shall be so;\r\nthe unknown always fills my mind with terrible possibilities, even when\r\nI may reasonably expect it to be cheerful.... Clym, the eclipsed\r\nmoonlight shines upon your face with a strange foreign colour, and\r\nshows its shape as if it were cut out in gold. That means that you\r\nshould be doing better things than this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are ambitious, Eustacia\xe2\x80\x94no, not exactly ambitious, luxurious. I\r\nought to be of the same vein, to make you happy, I suppose. And yet,\r\nfar from that, I could live and die in a hermitage here, with proper\r\nwork to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was that in his tone which implied distrust of his position as a\r\nsolicitous lover, a doubt if he were acting fairly towards one whose\r\ntastes touched his own only at rare and infrequent points. She saw his\r\nmeaning, and whispered, in a low, full accent of eager assurance,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mistake me, Clym\xe2\x80\x94though I should like Paris, I love you for\r\nyourself alone. To be your wife and live in Paris would be heaven to\r\nme; but I would rather live with you in a hermitage here than not be\r\nyours at all. It is gain to me either way, and very great gain. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmy too candid confession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpoken like a woman. And now I must soon leave you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll walk with you\r\ntowards your house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut must you go home yet?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, the sand has nearly\r\nslipped away, I see, and the eclipse is creeping on more and more.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t go yet! Stop till the hour has run itself out; then I will not\r\npress you any more. You will go home and sleep well; I keep sighing in\r\nmy sleep! Do you ever dream of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot recollect a clear dream of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see your face in every scene of my dreams, and hear your voice in\r\nevery sound. I wish I did not. It is too much what I feel. They say\r\nsuch love never lasts. But it must! And yet once, I remember, I saw an\r\nofficer of the Hussars ride down the street at Budmouth, and though he\r\nwas a total stranger and never spoke to me, I loved him till I thought\r\nI should really die of love\xe2\x80\x94but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t die, and at last I left off\r\ncaring for him. How terrible it would be if a time should come when I\r\ncould not love you, my Clym!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t say such reckless things. When we see such a time at hand\r\nwe will say, \xe2\x80\x98I have outlived my faith and purpose,\xe2\x80\x99 and die. There,\r\nthe hour has expired\xe2\x80\x94now let us walk on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHand in hand they went along the path towards Mistover. When they were\r\nnear the house he said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is too late for me to see your grandfather\r\ntonight. Do you think he will object to it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will speak to him. I am so accustomed to be my own mistress that it\r\ndid not occur to me that we should have to ask him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they lingeringly separated, and Clym descended towards Blooms-End.\r\n\r\nAnd as he walked further and further from the charmed atmosphere of his\r\nOlympian girl his face grew sad with a new sort of sadness. A\r\nperception of the dilemma in which his love had placed him came back in\r\nfull force. In spite of Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s apparent willingness to wait through\r\nthe period of an unpromising engagement, till he should be established\r\nin his new pursuit, he could not but perceive at moments that she loved\r\nhim rather as a visitant from a gay world to which she rightly belonged\r\nthan as a man with a purpose opposed to that recent past of his which\r\nso interested her. It meant that, though she made no conditions as to\r\nhis return to the French capital, this was what she secretly longed for\r\nin the event of marriage; and it robbed him of many an otherwise\r\npleasant hour. Along with that came the widening breach between himself\r\nand his mother. Whenever any little occurrence had brought into more\r\nprominence than usual the disappointment that he was causing her it had\r\nsent him on lone and moody walks; or he was kept awake a great part of\r\nthe night by the turmoil of spirit which such a recognition created. If\r\nMrs. Yeobright could only have been led to see what a sound and worthy\r\npurpose this purpose of his was and how little it was being affected by\r\nhis devotions to Eustacia, how differently would she regard him!\r\n\r\nThus as his sight grew accustomed to the first blinding halo kindled\r\nabout him by love and beauty, Yeobright began to perceive what a strait\r\nhe was in. Sometimes he wished that he had never known Eustacia,\r\nimmediately to retract the wish as brutal. Three antagonistic growths\r\nhad to be kept alive: his mother\xe2\x80\x99s trust in him, his plan for becoming\r\na teacher, and Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s happiness. His fervid nature could not afford\r\nto relinquish one of these, though two of the three were as many as he\r\ncould hope to preserve. Though his love was as chaste as that of\r\nPetrarch for his Laura, it had made fetters of what previously was only\r\na difficulty. A position which was not too simple when he stood\r\nwhole-hearted had become indescribably complicated by the addition of\r\nEustacia. Just when his mother was beginning to tolerate one scheme he\r\nhad introduced another still bitterer than the first, and the\r\ncombination was more than she could bear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\nSharp Words Are Spoken, and a Crisis Ensues\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Yeobright was not with Eustacia he was sitting slavishly over his\r\nbooks; when he was not reading he was meeting her. These meetings were\r\ncarried on with the greatest secrecy.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon his mother came home from a morning visit to Thomasin. He\r\ncould see from a disturbance in the lines of her face that something\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been told an incomprehensible thing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said mournfully. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\ncaptain has let out at the Woman that you and Eustacia Vye are engaged\r\nto be married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yeobright. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it may not be yet for a very long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should hardly think it _would_ be yet for a very long time! You will\r\ntake her to Paris, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke with weary hopelessness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not going back to Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you do with a wife, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep a school in Budmouth, as I have told you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s incredible! The place is overrun with schoolmasters. You have\r\nno special qualifications. What possible chance is there for such as\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no chance of getting rich. But with my system of education,\r\nwhich is as new as it is true, I shall do a great deal of good to my\r\nfellow-creatures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDreams, dreams! If there had been any system left to be invented they\r\nwould have found it out at the universities long before this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, Mother. They cannot find it out, because their teachers don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome in contact with the class which demands such a system\xe2\x80\x94that is,\r\nthose who have had no preliminary training. My plan is one for\r\ninstilling high knowledge into empty minds without first cramming them\r\nwith what has to be uncrammed again before true study begins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might have believed you if you had kept yourself free from\r\nentanglements; but this woman\xe2\x80\x94if she had been a good girl it would have\r\nbeen bad enough; but being\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is a good girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you think. A Corfu bandmaster\xe2\x80\x99s daughter! What has her life been?\r\nHer surname even is not her true one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is Captain Vye\xe2\x80\x99s granddaughter, and her father merely took her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s name. And she is a lady by instinct.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey call him \xe2\x80\x98captain,\xe2\x80\x99 but anybody is captain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was in the Royal Navy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt he has been to sea in some tub or other. Why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he look\r\nafter her? No lady would rove about the heath at all hours of the day\r\nand night as she does. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not all of it. There was something\r\nqueer between her and Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s husband at one time\xe2\x80\x94I am as sure of it\r\nas that I stand here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEustacia has told me. He did pay her a little attention a year ago;\r\nbut there\xe2\x80\x99s no harm in that. I like her all the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClym,\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother with firmness, \xe2\x80\x9cI have no proofs against her,\r\nunfortunately. But if she makes you a good wife, there has never been a\r\nbad one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, you are almost exasperating,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yeobright vehemently.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this very day I had intended to arrange a meeting between you. But\r\nyou give me no peace; you try to thwart my wishes in everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate the thought of any son of mine marrying badly! I wish I had\r\nnever lived to see this; it is too much for me\xe2\x80\x94it is more than I\r\ndreamt!\xe2\x80\x9d She turned to the window. Her breath was coming quickly, and\r\nher lips were pale, parted, and trembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym, \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever you do, you will always be dear to\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94that you know. But one thing I have a right to say, which is, that\r\nat my age I am old enough to know what is best for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Yeobright remained for some time silent and shaken, as if she\r\ncould say no more. Then she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cBest? Is it best for you to\r\ninjure your prospects for such a voluptuous, idle woman as that? Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou see that by the very fact of your choosing her you prove that you\r\ndo not know what is best for you? You give up your whole thought\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nset your whole soul\xe2\x80\x94to please a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do. And that woman is you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you treat me so flippantly!\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother, turning again to\r\nhim with a tearful look. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are unnatural, Clym, and I did not expect\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely,\xe2\x80\x9d said he cheerlessly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou did not know the measure you\r\nwere going to mete me, and therefore did not know the measure that\r\nwould be returned to you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou answer me; you think only of her. You stick to her in all things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat proves her to be worthy. I have never yet supported what is bad.\r\nAnd I do not care only for her. I care for you and for myself, and for\r\nanything that is good. When a woman once dislikes another she is\r\nmerciless!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Clym! please don\xe2\x80\x99t go setting down as my fault what is your\r\nobstinate wrongheadedness. If you wished to connect yourself with an\r\nunworthy person why did you come home here to do it? Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you do\r\nit in Paris?\xe2\x80\x94it is more the fashion there. You have come only to\r\ndistress me, a lonely woman, and shorten my days! I wish that you would\r\nbestow your presence where you bestow your love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClym said huskily, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are my mother. I will say no more\xe2\x80\x94beyond this,\r\nthat I beg your pardon for having thought this my home. I will no\r\nlonger inflict myself upon you; I\xe2\x80\x99ll go.\xe2\x80\x9d And he went out with tears in\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\nIt was a sunny afternoon at the beginning of summer, and the moist\r\nhollows of the heath had passed from their brown to their green stage.\r\nYeobright walked to the edge of the basin which extended down from\r\nMistover and Rainbarrow.\r\n\r\nBy this time he was calm, and he looked over the landscape. In the\r\nminor valleys, between the hillocks which diversified the contour of\r\nthe vale, the fresh young ferns were luxuriantly growing up, ultimately\r\nto reach a height of five or six feet. He descended a little way, flung\r\nhimself down in a spot where a path emerged from one of the small\r\nhollows, and waited. Hither it was that he had promised Eustacia to\r\nbring his mother this afternoon, that they might meet and be friends.\r\nHis attempt had utterly failed.\r\n\r\nHe was in a nest of vivid green. The ferny vegetation round him, though\r\nso abundant, was quite uniform\xe2\x80\x94it was a grove of machine-made foliage,\r\na world of green triangles with saw-edges, and not a single flower. The\r\nair was warm with a vaporous warmth, and the stillness was unbroken.\r\nLizards, grasshoppers, and ants were the only living things to be\r\nbeheld. The scene seemed to belong to the ancient world of the\r\ncarboniferous period, when the forms of plants were few, and of the\r\nfern kind; when there was neither bud nor blossom, nothing but a\r\nmonotonous extent of leafage, amid which no bird sang.\r\n\r\nWhen he had reclined for some considerable time, gloomily pondering, he\r\ndiscerned above the ferns a drawn bonnet of white silk approaching from\r\nthe left, and Yeobright knew directly that it covered the head of her\r\nhe loved. His heart awoke from its apathy to a warm excitement, and,\r\njumping to his feet, he said aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew she was sure to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe vanished in a hollow for a few moments, and then her whole form\r\nunfolded itself from the brake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly you here?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, with a disappointed air, whose\r\nhollowness was proved by her rising redness and her half-guilty low\r\nlaugh. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Mrs. Yeobright?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has not come,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied in a subdued tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had known that you would be here alone,\xe2\x80\x9d she said seriously,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand that we were going to have such an idle, pleasant time as this.\r\nPleasure not known beforehand is half wasted; to anticipate it is to\r\ndouble it. I have not thought once today of having you all to myself\r\nthis afternoon, and the actual moment of a thing is so soon gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Clym!\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, looking tenderly into his face. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\nsad. Something has happened at your home. Never mind what is\xe2\x80\x94let us\r\nonly look at what seems.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, darling, what shall we do?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill go on as we do now\xe2\x80\x94just live on from meeting to meeting, never\r\nminding about another day. You, I know, are always thinking of that\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ncan see you are. But you must not\xe2\x80\x94will you, dear Clym?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are just like all women. They are ever content to build their\r\nlives on any incidental position that offers itself; whilst men would\r\nfain make a globe to suit them. Listen to this, Eustacia. There is a\r\nsubject I have determined to put off no longer. Your sentiment on the\r\nwisdom of _Carpe diem_ does not impress me today. Our present mode of\r\nlife must shortly be brought to an end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is your mother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is. I love you none the less in telling you; it is only right you\r\nshould know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have feared my bliss,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with the merest motion of her lips.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has been too intense and consuming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is hope yet. There are forty years of work in me yet, and why\r\nshould you despair? I am only at an awkward turning. I wish people\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so ready to think that there is no progress without\r\nuniformity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94your mind runs off to the philosophical side of it. Well, these sad\r\nand hopeless obstacles are welcome in one sense, for they enable us to\r\nlook with indifference upon the cruel satires that Fate loves to\r\nindulge in. I have heard of people, who, upon coming suddenly into\r\nhappiness, have died from anxiety lest they should not live to enjoy\r\nit. I felt myself in that whimsical state of uneasiness lately; but I\r\nshall be spared it now. Let us walk on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClym took the hand which was already bared for him\xe2\x80\x94it was a favourite\r\nway with them to walk bare hand in bare hand\xe2\x80\x94and led her through the\r\nferns. They formed a very comely picture of love at full flush, as they\r\nwalked along the valley that late afternoon, the sun sloping down on\r\ntheir right, and throwing their thin spectral shadows, tall as poplar\r\ntrees, far out across the furze and fern. Eustacia went with her head\r\nthrown back fancifully, a certain glad and voluptuous air of triumph\r\npervading her eyes at having won by her own unaided self a man who was\r\nher perfect complement in attainment, appearance, and age. On the young\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s part, the paleness of face which he had brought with him from\r\nParis, and the incipient marks of time and thought, were less\r\nperceptible than when he returned, the healthful and energetic\r\nsturdiness which was his by nature having partially recovered its\r\noriginal proportions. They wandered onward till they reached the nether\r\nmargin of the heath, where it became marshy and merged in moorland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must part from you here, Clym,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia.\r\n\r\nThey stood still and prepared to bid each other farewell. Everything\r\nbefore them was on a perfect level. The sun, resting on the horizon\r\nline, streamed across the ground from between copper-coloured and lilac\r\nclouds, stretched out in flats beneath a sky of pale soft green. All\r\ndark objects on the earth that lay towards the sun were overspread by a\r\npurple haze, against which groups of wailing gnats shone out, rising\r\nupwards and dancing about like sparks of fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! this leaving you is too hard to bear!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Eustacia in a\r\nsudden whisper of anguish. \xe2\x80\x9cYour mother will influence you too much; I\r\nshall not be judged fairly, it will get afloat that I am not a good\r\ngirl, and the witch story will be added to make me blacker!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey cannot. Nobody dares to speak disrespectfully of you or of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh how I wish I was sure of never losing you\xe2\x80\x94that you could not be\r\nable to desert me anyhow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClym stood silent a moment. His feelings were high, the moment was\r\npassionate, and he cut the knot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall be sure of me, darling,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, folding her in his arms.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will be married at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Clym!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you agree to it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf\xe2\x80\x94if we can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe certainly can, both being of full age. And I have not followed my\r\noccupation all these years without having accumulated money; and if you\r\nwill agree to live in a tiny cottage somewhere on the heath, until I\r\ntake a house in Budmouth for the school, we can do it at a very little\r\nexpense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long shall we have to live in the tiny cottage, Clym?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout six months. At the end of that time I shall have finished my\r\nreading\xe2\x80\x94yes, we will do it, and this heart-aching will be over. We\r\nshall, of course, live in absolute seclusion, and our married life will\r\nonly begin to outward view when we take the house in Budmouth, where I\r\nhave already addressed a letter on the matter. Would your grandfather\r\nallow you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he would\xe2\x80\x94on the understanding that it should not last longer\r\nthan six months.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will guarantee that, if no misfortune happens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf no misfortune happens,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is not likely. Dearest, fix the exact day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then they consulted on the question, and the day was chosen. It was\r\nto be a fortnight from that time.\r\n\r\nThis was the end of their talk, and Eustacia left him. Clym watched her\r\nas she retired towards the sun. The luminous rays wrapped her up with\r\nher increasing distance, and the rustle of her dress over the sprouting\r\nsedge and grass died away. As he watched, the dead flat of the scenery\r\noverpowered him, though he was fully alive to the beauty of that\r\nuntarnished early summer green which was worn for the nonce by the\r\npoorest blade. There was something in its oppressive horizontality\r\nwhich too much reminded him of the arena of life; it gave him a sense\r\nof bare equality with, and no superiority to, a single living thing\r\nunder the sun.\r\n\r\nEustacia was now no longer the goddess but the woman to him, a being to\r\nfight for, support, help, be maligned for. Now that he had reached a\r\ncooler moment he would have preferred a less hasty marriage; but the\r\ncard was laid, and he determined to abide by the game. Whether Eustacia\r\nwas to add one other to the list of those who love too hotly to love\r\nlong and well, the forthcoming event was certainly a ready way of\r\nproving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\nYeobright Goes, and the Breach Is Complete\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that evening smart sounds denoting an active packing up came from\r\nYeobright\xe2\x80\x99s room to the ears of his mother downstairs.\r\n\r\nNext morning he departed from the house and again proceeded across the\r\nheath. A long day\xe2\x80\x99s march was before him, his object being to secure a\r\ndwelling to which he might take Eustacia when she became his wife. Such\r\na house, small, secluded, and with its windows boarded up, he had\r\ncasually observed a month earlier, about two miles beyond the village\r\nof East Egdon, and six miles distant altogether; and thither he\r\ndirected his steps today.\r\n\r\nThe weather was far different from that of the evening before. The\r\nyellow and vapoury sunset which had wrapped up Eustacia from his\r\nparting gaze had presaged change. It was one of those not infrequent\r\ndays of an English June which are as wet and boisterous as November.\r\nThe cold clouds hastened on in a body, as if painted on a moving slide.\r\nVapours from other continents arrived upon the wind, which curled and\r\nparted round him as he walked on.\r\n\r\nAt length Clym reached the margin of a fir and beech plantation that\r\nhad been enclosed from heath-land in the year of his birth. Here the\r\ntrees, laden heavily with their new and humid leaves, were now\r\nsuffering more damage than during the highest winds of winter, when the\r\nboughs are especially disencumbered to do battle with the storm. The\r\nwet young beeches were undergoing amputations, bruises, cripplings, and\r\nharsh lacerations, from which the wasting sap would bleed for many a\r\nday to come, and which would leave scars visible till the day of their\r\nburning. Each stem was wrenched at the root, where it moved like a bone\r\nin its socket, and at every onset of the gale convulsive sounds came\r\nfrom the branches, as if pain were felt. In a neighbouring brake a\r\nfinch was trying to sing; but the wind blew under his feathers till\r\nthey stood on end, twisted round his little tail, and made him give up\r\nhis song.\r\n\r\nYet a few yards to Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s left, on the open heath, how\r\nineffectively gnashed the storm! Those gusts which tore the trees\r\nmerely waved the furze and heather in a light caress. Egdon was made\r\nfor such times as these.\r\n\r\nYeobright reached the empty house about midday. It was almost as lonely\r\nas that of Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather, but the fact that it stood near a\r\nheath was disguised by a belt of firs which almost enclosed the\r\npremises. He journeyed on about a mile further to the village in which\r\nthe owner lived, and, returning with him to the house, arrangements\r\nwere completed, and the man undertook that one room at least should be\r\nready for occupation the next day. Clym\xe2\x80\x99s intention was to live there\r\nalone until Eustacia should join him on their wedding-day.\r\n\r\nThen he turned to pursue his way homeward through the drizzle that had\r\nso greatly transformed the scene. The ferns, among which he had lain in\r\ncomfort yesterday, were dripping moisture from every frond, wetting his\r\nlegs through as he brushed past; and the fur of the rabbits leaping\r\nbefore him was clotted into dark locks by the same watery surrounding.\r\n\r\nHe reached home damp and weary enough after his ten-mile walk. It had\r\nhardly been a propitious beginning, but he had chosen his course, and\r\nwould show no swerving. The evening and the following morning were\r\nspent in concluding arrangements for his departure. To stay at home a\r\nminute longer than necessary after having once come to his\r\ndetermination would be, he felt, only to give new pain to his mother by\r\nsome word, look, or deed.\r\n\r\nHe had hired a conveyance and sent off his goods by two o\xe2\x80\x99clock that\r\nday. The next step was to get some furniture, which, after serving for\r\ntemporary use in the cottage, would be available for the house at\r\nBudmouth when increased by goods of a better description. A mart\r\nextensive enough for the purpose existed at Anglebury, some miles\r\nbeyond the spot chosen for his residence, and there he resolved to pass\r\nthe coming night.\r\n\r\nIt now only remained to wish his mother good-bye. She was sitting by\r\nthe window as usual when he came downstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, I am going to leave you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, holding out his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you were, by your packing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Yeobright in a\r\nvoice from which every particle of emotion was painfully excluded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will part friends with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, Clym.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to be married on the twenty-fifth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you were going to be married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then\xe2\x80\x94and then you must come and see us. You will understand me\r\nbetter after that, and our situation will not be so wretched as it is\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not think it likely I shall come to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it will not be my fault or Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s, Mother. Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe kissed her cheek, and departed in great misery, which was several\r\nhours in lessening itself to a controllable level. The position had\r\nbeen such that nothing more could be said without, in the first place,\r\nbreaking down a barrier; and that was not to be done.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Yeobright gone from his mother\xe2\x80\x99s house than her face\r\nchanged its rigid aspect for one of blank despair. After a while she\r\nwept, and her tears brought some relief. During the rest of the day she\r\ndid nothing but walk up and down the garden path in a state bordering\r\non stupefaction. Night came, and with it but little rest. The next day,\r\nwith an instinct to do something which should reduce prostration to\r\nmournfulness, she went to her son\xe2\x80\x99s room, and with her own hands\r\narranged it in order, for an imaginary time when he should return\r\nagain. She gave some attention to her flowers, but it was perfunctorily\r\nbestowed, for they no longer charmed her.\r\n\r\nIt was a great relief when, early in the afternoon, Thomasin paid her\r\nan unexpected visit. This was not the first meeting between the\r\nrelatives since Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s marriage; and past blunders having been in a\r\nrough way rectified, they could always greet each other with pleasure\r\nand ease.\r\n\r\nThe oblique band of sunlight which followed her through the door became\r\nthe young wife well. It illuminated her as her presence illuminated the\r\nheath. In her movements, in her gaze, she reminded the beholder of the\r\nfeathered creatures who lived around her home. All similes and\r\nallegories concerning her began and ended with birds. There was as much\r\nvariety in her motions as in their flight. When she was musing she was\r\na kestrel, which hangs in the air by an invisible motion of its wings.\r\nWhen she was in a high wind her light body was blown against trees and\r\nbanks like a heron\xe2\x80\x99s. When she was frightened she darted noiselessly\r\nlike a kingfisher. When she was serene she skimmed like a swallow, and\r\nthat is how she was moving now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are looking very blithe, upon my word, Tamsie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nYeobright, with a sad smile. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is Damon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he kind to you, Thomasin?\xe2\x80\x9d And Mrs. Yeobright observed her\r\nnarrowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty fairly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that honestly said?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Aunt. I would tell you if he were unkind.\xe2\x80\x9d She added, blushing,\r\nand with hesitation, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I ought to complain to you\r\nabout this, but I am not quite sure what to do. I want some money, you\r\nknow, Aunt\xe2\x80\x94some to buy little things for myself\xe2\x80\x94and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give me\r\nany. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to ask him; and yet, perhaps, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give it me\r\nbecause he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know. Ought I to mention it to him, Aunt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you ought. Have you never said a word on the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, I had some of my own,\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomasin evasively, \xe2\x80\x9cand I have\r\nnot wanted any of his until lately. I did just say something about it\r\nlast week; but he seems\xe2\x80\x94not to remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must be made to remember. You are aware that I have a little box\r\nfull of spade-guineas, which your uncle put into my hands to divide\r\nbetween yourself and Clym whenever I chose. Perhaps the time has come\r\nwhen it should be done. They can be turned into sovereigns at any\r\nmoment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I should like to have my share\xe2\x80\x94that is, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall, if necessary. But it is only proper that you should first\r\ntell your husband distinctly that you are without any, and see what he\r\nwill do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, I will.... Aunt, I have heard about Clym. I know you are in\r\ntrouble about him, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why I have come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Yeobright turned away, and her features worked in her attempt to\r\nconceal her feelings. Then she ceased to make any attempt, and said,\r\nweeping, \xe2\x80\x9cO Thomasin, do you think he hates me? How can he bear to\r\ngrieve me so, when I have lived only for him through all these years?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHate you\xe2\x80\x94no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomasin soothingly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is only that he loves her\r\ntoo well. Look at it quietly\xe2\x80\x94do. It is not so very bad of him. Do you\r\nknow, I thought it not the worst match he could have made. Miss Vye\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfamily is a good one on her mother\xe2\x80\x99s side; and her father was a\r\nromantic wanderer\xe2\x80\x94a sort of Greek Ulysses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no use, Thomasin; it is no use. Your intention is good; but I\r\nwill not trouble you to argue. I have gone through the whole that can\r\nbe said on either side times, and many times. Clym and I have not\r\nparted in anger; we have parted in a worse way. It is not a passionate\r\nquarrel that would have broken my heart; it is the steady opposition\r\nand persistence in going wrong that he has shown. O Thomasin, he was so\r\ngood as a little boy\xe2\x80\x94so tender and kind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was, I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not think one whom I called mine would grow up to treat me like\r\nthis. He spoke to me as if I opposed him to injure him. As though I\r\ncould wish him ill!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are worse women in the world than Eustacia Vye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are too many better that\xe2\x80\x99s the agony of it. It was she,\r\nThomasin, and she only, who led your husband to act as he did\xe2\x80\x94I would\r\nswear it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomasin eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was before he knew me that he thought\r\nof her, and it was nothing but a mere flirtation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; we will let it be so. There is little use in unravelling\r\nthat now. Sons must be blind if they will. Why is it that a woman can\r\nsee from a distance what a man cannot see close? Clym must do as he\r\nwill\xe2\x80\x94he is nothing more to me. And this is maternity\xe2\x80\x94to give one\xe2\x80\x99s best\r\nyears and best love to ensure the fate of being despised!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are too unyielding. Think how many mothers there are whose sons\r\nhave brought them to public shame by real crimes before you feel so\r\ndeeply a case like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThomasin, don\xe2\x80\x99t lecture me\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t have it. It is the excess above\r\nwhat we expect that makes the force of the blow, and that may not be\r\ngreater in their case than in mine\xe2\x80\x94they may have foreseen the worst....\r\nI am wrongly made, Thomasin,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with a mournful smile. \xe2\x80\x9cSome\r\nwidows can guard against the wounds their children give them by turning\r\ntheir hearts to another husband and beginning life again. But I always\r\nwas a poor, weak, one-idea\xe2\x80\x99d creature\xe2\x80\x94I had not the compass of heart\r\nnor the enterprise for that. Just as forlorn and stupefied as I was\r\nwhen my husband\xe2\x80\x99s spirit flew away I have sat ever since\xe2\x80\x94never\r\nattempting to mend matters at all. I was comparatively a young woman\r\nthen, and I might have had another family by this time, and have been\r\ncomforted by them for the failure of this one son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is more noble in you that you did not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe more noble, the less wise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForget it, and be soothed, dear Aunt. And I shall not leave you alone\r\nfor long. I shall come and see you every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd for one week Thomasin literally fulfilled her word. She endeavoured\r\nto make light of the wedding; and brought news of the preparations, and\r\nthat she was invited to be present. The next week she was rather\r\nunwell, and did not appear. Nothing had as yet been done about the\r\nguineas, for Thomasin feared to address her husband again on the\r\nsubject, and Mrs. Yeobright had insisted upon this.\r\n\r\nOne day just before this time Wildeve was standing at the door of the\r\nQuiet Woman. In addition to the upward path through the heath to\r\nRainbarrow and Mistover, there was a road which branched from the\r\nhighway a short distance below the inn, and ascended to Mistover by a\r\ncircuitous and easy incline. This was the only route on that side for\r\nvehicles to the captain\xe2\x80\x99s retreat. A light cart from the nearest town\r\ndescended the road, and the lad who was driving pulled up in front of\r\nthe inn for something to drink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou come from Mistover?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. They are taking in good things up there. Going to be a wedding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd the driver buried his face in his mug.\r\n\r\nWildeve had not received an inkling of the fact before, and a sudden\r\nexpression of pain overspread his face. He turned for a moment into the\r\npassage to hide it. Then he came back again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean Miss Vye?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is it\xe2\x80\x94that she can be married so\r\nsoon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the will of God and a ready young man, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean Mr. Yeobright?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. He has been creeping about with her all the spring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose\xe2\x80\x94she was immensely taken with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is crazy about him, so their general servant of all work tells me.\r\nAnd that lad Charley that looks after the horse is all in a daze about\r\nit. The stun-poll has got fond-like of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she lively\xe2\x80\x94is she glad? Going to be married so soon\xe2\x80\x94well!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t so very soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; not so very soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWildeve went indoors to the empty room, a curious heartache within him.\r\nHe rested his elbow upon the mantelpiece and his face upon his hand.\r\nWhen Thomasin entered the room he did not tell her of what he had\r\nheard. The old longing for Eustacia had reappeared in his soul\xe2\x80\x94and it\r\nwas mainly because he had discovered that it was another man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nintention to possess her.\r\n\r\nTo be yearning for the difficult, to be weary of that offered; to care\r\nfor the remote, to dislike the near; it was Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s nature always.\r\nThis is the true mark of the man of sentiment. Though Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s fevered\r\nfeeling had not been elaborated to real poetical compass, it was of the\r\nstandard sort. His might have been called the Rousseau of Egdon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\nThe Morning and the Evening of a Day\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wedding morning came. Nobody would have imagined from appearances\r\nthat Blooms-End had any interest in Mistover that day. A solemn\r\nstillness prevailed around the house of Clym\xe2\x80\x99s mother, and there was no\r\nmore animation indoors. Mrs. Yeobright, who had declined to attend the\r\nceremony, sat by the breakfast table in the old room which communicated\r\nimmediately with the porch, her eyes listlessly directed towards the\r\nopen door. It was the room in which, six months earlier, the merry\r\nChristmas party had met, to which Eustacia came secretly and as a\r\nstranger. The only living thing that entered now was a sparrow; and\r\nseeing no movements to cause alarm, he hopped boldly round the room,\r\nendeavoured to go out by the window, and fluttered among the\r\npot-flowers. This roused the lonely sitter, who got up, released the\r\nbird, and went to the door. She was expecting Thomasin, who had written\r\nthe night before to state that the time had come when she would wish to\r\nhave the money and that she would if possible call this day.\r\n\r\nYet Thomasin occupied Mrs. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts but slightly as she\r\nlooked up the valley of the heath, alive with butterflies, and with\r\ngrasshoppers whose husky noises on every side formed a whispered\r\nchorus. A domestic drama, for which the preparations were now being\r\nmade a mile or two off, was but little less vividly present to her eyes\r\nthan if enacted before her. She tried to dismiss the vision, and walked\r\nabout the garden plot; but her eyes ever and anon sought out the\r\ndirection of the parish church to which Mistover belonged, and her\r\nexcited fancy clove the hills which divided the building from her eyes.\r\nThe morning wore away. Eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock struck\xe2\x80\x94could it be that the\r\nwedding was then in progress? It must be so. She went on imagining the\r\nscene at the church, which he had by this time approached with his\r\nbride. She pictured the little group of children by the gate as the\r\npony carriage drove up in which, as Thomasin had learnt, they were\r\ngoing to perform the short journey. Then she saw them enter and proceed\r\nto the chancel and kneel; and the service seemed to go on.\r\n\r\nShe covered her face with her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cO, it is a mistake!\xe2\x80\x9d she groaned.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he will rue it some day, and think of me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile she remained thus, overcome by her forebodings, the old clock\r\nindoors whizzed forth twelve strokes. Soon after, faint sounds floated\r\nto her ear from afar over the hills. The breeze came from that quarter,\r\nand it had brought with it the notes of distant bells, gaily starting\r\noff in a peal: one, two, three, four, five. The ringers at East Egdon\r\nwere announcing the nuptials of Eustacia and her son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it is over,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, well! and life too will be over\r\nsoon. And why should I go on scalding my face like this? Cry about one\r\nthing in life, cry about all; one thread runs through the whole piece.\r\nAnd yet we say, \xe2\x80\x98a time to laugh!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTowards evening Wildeve came. Since Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s marriage Mrs. Yeobright\r\nhad shown him that grim friendliness which at last arises in all such\r\ncases of undesired affinity. The vision of what ought to have been is\r\nthrown aside in sheer weariness, and browbeaten human endeavour\r\nlistlessly makes the best of the fact that is. Wildeve, to do him\r\njustice, had behaved very courteously to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s aunt; and it was\r\nwith no surprise that she saw him enter now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThomasin has not been able to come, as she promised to do,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied\r\nto her inquiry, which had been anxious, for she knew that her niece was\r\nbadly in want of money. \xe2\x80\x9cThe captain came down last night and\r\npersonally pressed her to join them today. So, not to be unpleasant,\r\nshe determined to go. They fetched her in the pony-chaise, and are\r\ngoing to bring her back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it is done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright. \xe2\x80\x9cHave they gone to their new\r\nhome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I have had no news from Mistover since Thomasin left to\r\ngo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did not go with her?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, as if there might be good reasons\r\nwhy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve, reddening slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe could not both\r\nleave the house; it was rather a busy morning, on account of Anglebury\r\nGreat Market. I believe you have something to give to Thomasin? If you\r\nlike, I will take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Yeobright hesitated, and wondered if Wildeve knew what the\r\nsomething was. \xe2\x80\x9cDid she tell you of this?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot particularly. She casually dropped a remark about having arranged\r\nto fetch some article or other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is hardly necessary to send it. She can have it whenever she\r\nchooses to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat won\xe2\x80\x99t be yet. In the present state of her health she must not go\r\non walking so much as she has done.\xe2\x80\x9d He added, with a faint twang of\r\nsarcasm, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat wonderful thing is it that I cannot be trusted to take?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing worth troubling you with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne would think you doubted my honesty,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a laugh, though\r\nhis colour rose in a quick resentfulness frequent with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need think no such thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said she drily. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is simply that I,\r\nin common with the rest of the world, feel that there are certain\r\nthings which had better be done by certain people than by others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you like, as you like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve laconically. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not worth\r\narguing about. Well, I think I must turn homeward again, as the inn\r\nmust not be left long in charge of the lad and the maid only.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went his way, his farewell being scarcely so courteous as his\r\ngreeting. But Mrs. Yeobright knew him thoroughly by this time, and took\r\nlittle notice of his manner, good or bad.\r\n\r\nWhen Wildeve was gone Mrs. Yeobright stood and considered what would be\r\nthe best course to adopt with regard to the guineas, which she had not\r\nliked to entrust to Wildeve. It was hardly credible that Thomasin had\r\ntold him to ask for them, when the necessity for them had arisen from\r\nthe difficulty of obtaining money at his hands. At the same time\r\nThomasin really wanted them, and might be unable to come to Blooms-End\r\nfor another week at least. To take or send the money to her at the inn\r\nwould be impolite, since Wildeve would pretty surely be present, or\r\nwould discover the transaction; and if, as her aunt suspected, he\r\ntreated her less kindly than she deserved to be treated, he might then\r\nget the whole sum out of her gentle hands. But on this particular\r\nevening Thomasin was at Mistover, and anything might be conveyed to her\r\nthere without the knowledge of her husband. Upon the whole the\r\nopportunity was worth taking advantage of.\r\n\r\nHer son, too, was there, and was now married. There could be no more\r\nproper moment to render him his share of the money than the present.\r\nAnd the chance that would be afforded her, by sending him this gift, of\r\nshowing how far she was from bearing him ill-will, cheered the sad\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\r\n\r\nShe went upstairs and took from a locked drawer a little box, out of\r\nwhich she poured a hoard of broad unworn guineas that had lain there\r\nmany a year. There were a hundred in all, and she divided them into two\r\nheaps, fifty in each. Tying up these in small canvas bags, she went\r\ndown to the garden and called to Christian Cantle, who was loitering\r\nabout in hope of a supper which was not really owed him. Mrs. Yeobright\r\ngave him the moneybags, charged him to go to Mistover, and on no\r\naccount to deliver them into any one\xe2\x80\x99s hands save her son\xe2\x80\x99s and\r\nThomasin\xe2\x80\x99s. On further thought she deemed it advisable to tell\r\nChristian precisely what the two bags contained, that he might be fully\r\nimpressed with their importance. Christian pocketed the moneybags,\r\npromised the greatest carefulness, and set out on his way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need not hurry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be better not to\r\nget there till after dusk, and then nobody will notice you. Come back\r\nhere to supper, if it is not too late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was nearly nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock when he began to ascend the vale towards\r\nMistover; but the long days of summer being at their climax, the first\r\nobscurity of evening had only just begun to tan the landscape. At this\r\npoint of his journey Christian heard voices, and found that they\r\nproceeded from a company of men and women who were traversing a hollow\r\nahead of him, the tops only of their heads being visible.\r\n\r\nHe paused and thought of the money he carried. It was almost too early\r\neven for Christian seriously to fear robbery; nevertheless he took a\r\nprecaution which ever since his boyhood he had adopted whenever he\r\ncarried more than two or three shillings upon his person\xe2\x80\x94a precaution\r\nsomewhat like that of the owner of the Pitt Diamond when filled with\r\nsimilar misgivings. He took off his boots, untied the guineas, and\r\nemptied the contents of one little bag into the right boot, and of the\r\nother into the left, spreading them as flatly as possible over the\r\nbottom of each, which was really a spacious coffer by no means limited\r\nto the size of the foot. Pulling them on again and lacing them to the\r\nvery top, he proceeded on his way, more easy in his head than under his\r\nsoles.\r\n\r\nHis path converged towards that of the noisy company, and on coming\r\nnearer he found to his relief that they were several Egdon people whom\r\nhe knew very well, while with them walked Fairway, of Blooms-End.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Christian going too?\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway as soon as he recognized the\r\nnewcomer. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got no young woman nor wife to your name to gie a\r\ngown-piece to, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99ye mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said Christian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the raffle. The one we go to every year. Going to the raffle as\r\nwell as ourselves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever knew a word o\xe2\x80\x99t. Is it like cudgel playing or other sportful\r\nforms of bloodshed? I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go, thank you, Mister Fairway, and\r\nno offence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristian don\xe2\x80\x99t know the fun o\xe2\x80\x99t, and \xe2\x80\x99twould be a fine sight for\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x9d said a buxom woman. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no danger at all, Christian. Every\r\nman puts in a shilling apiece, and one wins a gown-piece for his wife\r\nor sweetheart if he\xe2\x80\x99s got one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, as that\xe2\x80\x99s not my fortune there\xe2\x80\x99s no meaning in it to me. But I\r\nshould like to see the fun, if there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing of the black art in it,\r\nand if a man may look on without cost or getting into any dangerous\r\nwrangle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere will be no uproar at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Timothy. \xe2\x80\x9cSure, Christian, if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d like to come we\xe2\x80\x99ll see there\xe2\x80\x99s no harm done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd no ba\xe2\x80\x99dy gaieties, I suppose? You see, neighbours, if so, it would\r\nbe setting father a bad example, as he is so light moral\xe2\x80\x99d. But a\r\ngown-piece for a shilling, and no black art\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis worth looking in to\r\nsee, and it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hinder me half an hour. Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nstep a little way towards Mistover with me afterwards, supposing night\r\nshould have closed in, and nobody else is going that way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne or two promised; and Christian, diverging from his direct path,\r\nturned round to the right with his companions towards the Quiet Woman.\r\n\r\nWhen they entered the large common room of the inn they found assembled\r\nthere about ten men from among the neighbouring population, and the\r\ngroup was increased by the new contingent to double that number. Most\r\nof them were sitting round the room in seats divided by wooden elbows\r\nlike those of crude cathedral stalls, which were carved with the\r\ninitials of many an illustrious drunkard of former times who had passed\r\nhis days and his nights between them, and now lay as an alcoholic\r\ncinder in the nearest churchyard. Among the cups on the long table\r\nbefore the sitters lay an open parcel of light drapery\xe2\x80\x94the gown-piece,\r\nas it was called\xe2\x80\x94which was to be raffled for. Wildeve was standing with\r\nhis back to the fireplace smoking a cigar; and the promoter of the\r\nraffle, a packman from a distant town, was expatiating upon the value\r\nof the fabric as material for a summer dress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, as the newcomers drew up to the table,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s five have entered, and we want four more to make up the\r\nnumber. I think, by the faces of those gentlemen who have just come in,\r\nthat they are shrewd enough to take advantage of this rare opportunity\r\nof beautifying their ladies at a very trifling expense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFairway, Sam, and another placed their shillings on the table, and the\r\nman turned to Christian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christian, drawing back, with a quick gaze of\r\nmisgiving. \xe2\x80\x9cI am only a poor chap come to look on, an it please ye,\r\nsir. I don\xe2\x80\x99t so much as know how you do it. If so be I was sure of\r\ngetting it I would put down the shilling; but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you might almost be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said the pedlar. \xe2\x80\x9cIn fact, now I\r\nlook into your face, even if I can\xe2\x80\x99t say you are sure to win, I can say\r\nthat I never saw anything look more like winning in my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll anyhow have the same chance as the rest of us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the extra luck of being the last comer,\xe2\x80\x9d said another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I was born wi\xe2\x80\x99 a caul, and perhaps can be no more ruined than\r\ndrowned?\xe2\x80\x9d Christian added, beginning to give way.\r\n\r\nUltimately Christian laid down his shilling, the raffle began, and the\r\ndice went round. When it came to Christian\xe2\x80\x99s turn he took the box with\r\na trembling hand, shook it fearfully, and threw a pair-royal. Three of\r\nthe others had thrown common low pairs, and all the rest mere points.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gentleman looked like winning, as I said,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the chapman\r\nblandly. \xe2\x80\x9cTake it, sir; the article is yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaw-haw-haw!\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m damned if this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the quarest\r\nstart that ever I knowed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Christian, with a vacant stare from his target eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t got neither maid, wife, nor widder belonging to me at all, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m afeard it will make me laughed at to ha\xe2\x80\x99e it, Master Traveller.\r\nWhat with being curious to join in I never thought of that! What shall\r\nI do wi\xe2\x80\x99 a woman\xe2\x80\x99s clothes in _my_ bedroom, and not lose my decency!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep \xe2\x80\x99em, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway, \xe2\x80\x9cif it is only for luck. Perhaps\r\n\xe2\x80\x99twill tempt some woman that thy poor carcase had no power over when\r\nstanding empty-handed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep it, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve, who had idly watched the scene from\r\na distance.\r\n\r\nThe table was then cleared of the articles, and the men began to drink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d said Christian, half to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cTo think I should\r\nhave been born so lucky as this, and not have found it out until now!\r\nWhat curious creatures these dice be\xe2\x80\x94powerful rulers of us all, and yet\r\nat my command! I am sure I never need be afeared of anything after\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d He handled the dice fondly one by one. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a\r\nconfidential whisper to Wildeve, who was near his left hand, \xe2\x80\x9cif I\r\ncould only use this power that\xe2\x80\x99s in me of multiplying money I might do\r\nsome good to a near relation of yours, seeing what I\xe2\x80\x99ve got about me of\r\nhers\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d He tapped one of his money-laden boots upon the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a secret. Well, I must be going now.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked anxiously\r\ntowards Fairway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d Wildeve asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Mistover Knap. I have to see Mrs. Thomasin there\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going there, too, to fetch Mrs. Wildeve. We can walk together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWildeve became lost in thought, and a look of inward illumination came\r\ninto his eyes. It was money for his wife that Mrs. Yeobright could not\r\ntrust him with. \xe2\x80\x9cYet she could trust this fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that which belongs to the wife belong to the husband too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe called to the pot-boy to bring him his hat, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\r\nChristian, I am ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Wildeve,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christian timidly, as he turned to leave the room,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwould you mind lending me them wonderful little things that carry my\r\nluck inside \xe2\x80\x99em, that I might practise a bit by myself, you know?\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nlooked wistfully at the dice and box lying on the mantlepiece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve carelessly. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were only cut out by some\r\nlad with his knife, and are worth nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d And Christian went back and\r\nprivately pocketed them.\r\n\r\nWildeve opened the door and looked out. The night was warm and cloudy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Gad! \xe2\x80\x99tis dark,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I suppose we shall find our\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we should lose the path it might be awkward,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christian. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nlantern is the only shield that will make it safe for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s have a lantern by all means.\xe2\x80\x9d The stable lantern was fetched and\r\nlighted. Christian took up his gownpiece, and the two set out to ascend\r\nthe hill.\r\n\r\nWithin the room the men fell into chat till their attention was for a\r\nmoment drawn to the chimney-corner. This was large, and, in addition to\r\nits proper recess, contained within its jambs, like many on Egdon, a\r\nreceding seat, so that a person might sit there absolutely unobserved,\r\nprovided there was no fire to light him up, as was the case now and\r\nthroughout the summer. From the niche a single object protruded into\r\nthe light from the candles on the table. It was a clay pipe, and its\r\ncolour was reddish. The men had been attracted to this object by a\r\nvoice behind the pipe asking for a light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my life, it fairly startled me when the man spoke!\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway,\r\nhanding a candle. \xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis the reddleman! You\xe2\x80\x99ve kept a quiet tongue,\r\nyoung man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I had nothing to say,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Venn. In a few minutes he arose\r\nand wished the company good night.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Wildeve and Christian had plunged into the heath.\r\n\r\nIt was a stagnant, warm, and misty night, full of all the heavy\r\nperfumes of new vegetation not yet dried by hot sun, and among these\r\nparticularly the scent of the fern. The lantern, dangling from\r\nChristian\xe2\x80\x99s hand, brushed the feathery fronds in passing by, disturbing\r\nmoths and other winged insects, which flew out and alighted upon its\r\nhorny panes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you have money to carry to Mrs. Wildeve?\xe2\x80\x9d said Christian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompanion, after a silence. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think it very odd that it\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be given to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs man and wife be one flesh, \xe2\x80\x99twould have been all the same, I should\r\nthink,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christian. \xe2\x80\x9cBut my strict documents was, to give the money\r\ninto Mrs. Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s hand\xe2\x80\x94and \xe2\x80\x99tis well to do things right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve. Any person who had known the circumstances\r\nmight have perceived that Wildeve was mortified by the discovery that\r\nthe matter in transit was money, and not, as he had supposed when at\r\nBlooms-End, some fancy nick-nack which only interested the two women\r\nthemselves. Mrs. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s refusal implied that his honour was not\r\nconsidered to be of sufficiently good quality to make him a safer\r\nbearer of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s property.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow very warm it is tonight, Christian!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, panting, when they\r\nwere nearly under Rainbarrow. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us sit down for a few minutes, for\r\nHeaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWildeve flung himself down on the soft ferns; and Christian, placing\r\nthe lantern and parcel on the ground, perched himself in a cramped\r\nposition hard by, his knees almost touching his chin. He presently\r\nthrust one hand into his coat-pocket and began shaking it about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you rattling in there?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly the dice, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christian, quickly withdrawing his hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat magical machines these little things be, Mr. Wildeve! \xe2\x80\x99Tis a game\r\nI should never get tired of. Would you mind my taking \xe2\x80\x99em out and\r\nlooking at \xe2\x80\x99em for a minute, to see how they are made? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to\r\nlook close before the other men, for fear they should think it bad\r\nmanners in me.\xe2\x80\x9d Christian took them out and examined them in the hollow\r\nof his hand by the lantern light. \xe2\x80\x9cThat these little things should\r\ncarry such luck, and such charm, and such a spell, and such power in\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em, passes all I ever heard or zeed,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, with a fascinated\r\ngaze at the dice, which, as is frequently the case in country places,\r\nwere made of wood, the points being burnt upon each face with the end\r\nof a wire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are a great deal in a small compass, You think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Do ye suppose they really be the devil\xe2\x80\x99s playthings, Mr. Wildeve?\r\nIf so, \xe2\x80\x99tis no good sign that I be such a lucky man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to win some money, now that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got them. Any woman would\r\nmarry you then. Now is your time, Christian, and I would recommend you\r\nnot to let it slip. Some men are born to luck, some are not. I belong\r\nto the latter class.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever know anybody who was born to it besides myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes. I once heard of an Italian, who sat down at a gaming table with\r\nonly a louis, (that\xe2\x80\x99s a foreign sovereign), in his pocket. He played on\r\nfor twenty-four hours, and won ten thousand pounds, stripping the bank\r\nhe had played against. Then there was another man who had lost a\r\nthousand pounds, and went to the broker\xe2\x80\x99s next day to sell stock, that\r\nhe might pay the debt. The man to whom he owed the money went with him\r\nin a hackney-coach; and to pass the time they tossed who should pay the\r\nfare. The ruined man won, and the other was tempted to continue the\r\ngame, and they played all the way. When the coachman stopped he was\r\ntold to drive home again: the whole thousand pounds had been won back\r\nby the man who was going to sell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa\xe2\x80\x94ha\xe2\x80\x94splendid!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Christian. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on\xe2\x80\x94go on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen there was a man of London, who was only a waiter at White\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclubhouse. He began playing first half-crown stakes, and then higher\r\nand higher, till he became very rich, got an appointment in India, and\r\nrose to be Governor of Madras. His daughter married a member of\r\nParliament, and the Bishop of Carlisle stood godfather to one of the\r\nchildren.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWonderful! wonderful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd once there was a young man in America who gambled till he had lost\r\nhis last dollar. He staked his watch and chain, and lost as before;\r\nstaked his umbrella, lost again; staked his hat, lost again; staked his\r\ncoat and stood in his shirt-sleeves, lost again. Began taking off his\r\nbreeches, and then a looker-on gave him a trifle for his pluck. With\r\nthis he won. Won back his coat, won back his hat, won back his\r\numbrella, his watch, his money, and went out of the door a rich man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, \xe2\x80\x99tis too good\xe2\x80\x94it takes away my breath! Mr. Wildeve, I think I will\r\ntry another shilling with you, as I am one of that sort; no danger can\r\ncome o\xe2\x80\x99t, and you can afford to lose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve, rising. Searching about with the lantern, he\r\nfound a large flat stone, which he placed between himself and\r\nChristian, and sat down again. The lantern was opened to give more\r\nlight, and its rays directed upon the stone. Christian put down a\r\nshilling, Wildeve another, and each threw. Christian won. They played\r\nfor two, Christian won again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us try four,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve. They played for four. This time the\r\nstakes were won by Wildeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, those little accidents will, of course, sometimes happen, to the\r\nluckiest man,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now I have no more money!\xe2\x80\x9d explained Christian excitedly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nyet, if I could go on, I should get it back again, and more. I wish\r\nthis was mine.\xe2\x80\x9d He struck his boot upon the ground, so that the guineas\r\nchinked within.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! you have not put Mrs. Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s money there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. \xe2\x80\x99Tis for safety. Is it any harm to raffle with a married lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmoney when, if I win, I shall only keep my winnings, and give her her\r\nown all the same; and if t\xe2\x80\x99other man wins, her money will go to the\r\nlawful owner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWildeve had been brooding ever since they started on the mean\r\nestimation in which he was held by his wife\xe2\x80\x99s friends; and it cut his\r\nheart severely. As the minutes passed he had gradually drifted into a\r\nrevengeful intention without knowing the precise moment of forming it.\r\nThis was to teach Mrs. Yeobright a lesson, as he considered it to be;\r\nin other words, to show her if he could that her niece\xe2\x80\x99s husband was\r\nthe proper guardian of her niece\xe2\x80\x99s money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, here goes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Christian, beginning to unlace one boot. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshall dream of it nights and nights, I suppose; but I shall always\r\nswear my flesh don\xe2\x80\x99t crawl when I think o\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thrust his hand into the boot and withdrew one of poor Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprecious guineas, piping hot. Wildeve had already placed a sovereign on\r\nthe stone. The game was then resumed. Wildeve won first, and Christian\r\nventured another, winning himself this time. The game fluctuated, but\r\nthe average was in Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s favour. Both men became so absorbed in the\r\ngame that they took no heed of anything but the pigmy objects\r\nimmediately beneath their eyes, the flat stone, the open lantern, the\r\ndice, and the few illuminated fern-leaves which lay under the light,\r\nwere the whole world to them.\r\n\r\nAt length Christian lost rapidly; and presently, to his horror, the\r\nwhole fifty guineas belonging to Thomasin had been handed over to his\r\nadversary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t care!\xe2\x80\x9d he moaned, and desperately set about\r\nuntying his left boot to get at the other fifty. \xe2\x80\x9cThe devil will toss\r\nme into the flames on his three-pronged fork for this night\xe2\x80\x99s work, I\r\nknow! But perhaps I shall win yet, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll get a wife to sit up\r\nwith me o\xe2\x80\x99 nights and I won\xe2\x80\x99t be afeard, I won\xe2\x80\x99t! Here\xe2\x80\x99s another\r\nfor\xe2\x80\x99ee, my man!\xe2\x80\x9d He slapped another guinea down upon the stone, and the\r\ndice-box was rattled again.\r\n\r\nTime passed on. Wildeve began to be as excited as Christian himself.\r\nWhen commencing the game his intention had been nothing further than a\r\nbitter practical joke on Mrs. Yeobright. To win the money, fairly or\r\notherwise, and to hand it contemptuously to Thomasin in her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence, had been the dim outline of his purpose. But men are drawn\r\nfrom their intentions even in the course of carrying them out, and it\r\nwas extremely doubtful, by the time the twentieth guinea had been\r\nreached, whether Wildeve was conscious of any other intention than that\r\nof winning for his own personal benefit. Moreover, he was now no longer\r\ngambling for his wife\xe2\x80\x99s money, but for Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s; though of this fact\r\nChristian, in his apprehensiveness, did not inform him till afterwards.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when, with almost a shriek, Christian\r\nplaced Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s last gleaming guinea upon the stone. In thirty\r\nseconds it had gone the way of its companions.\r\n\r\nChristian turned and flung himself on the ferns in a convulsion of\r\nremorse, \xe2\x80\x9cO, what shall I do with my wretched self?\xe2\x80\x9d he groaned. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nshall I do? Will any good Heaven hae mercy upon my wicked soul?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo? Live on just the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t live on just the same! I\xe2\x80\x99ll die! I say you are a\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man sharper than my neighbour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a man sharper than my neighbour; a regular sharper!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor chips-in-porridge, you are very unmannerly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that! And I say you be unmannerly! You\xe2\x80\x99ve got money\r\nthat isn\xe2\x80\x99t your own. Half the guineas are poor Mr. Clym\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I had to gie fifty of \xe2\x80\x99em to him. Mrs. Yeobright said so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh?... Well, \xe2\x80\x99twould have been more graceful of her to have given them\r\nto his wife Eustacia. But they are in my hands now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristian pulled on his boots, and with heavy breathings, which could\r\nbe heard to some distance, dragged his limbs together, arose, and\r\ntottered away out of sight. Wildeve set about shutting the lantern to\r\nreturn to the house, for he deemed it too late to go to Mistover to\r\nmeet his wife, who was to be driven home in the captain\xe2\x80\x99s four-wheel.\r\nWhile he was closing the little horn door a figure rose from behind a\r\nneighbouring bush and came forward into the lantern light. It was the\r\nreddleman approaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\nA New Force Disturbs the Current\r\n\r\n\r\nWildeve stared. Venn looked coolly towards Wildeve, and, without a word\r\nbeing spoken, he deliberately sat himself down where Christian had been\r\nseated, thrust his hand into his pocket, drew out a sovereign, and laid\r\nit on the stone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been watching us from behind that bush?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve.\r\n\r\nThe reddleman nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cDown with your stake,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOr haven\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\npluck enough to go on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow, gambling is a species of amusement which is much more easily begun\r\nwith full pockets than left off with the same; and though Wildeve in a\r\ncooler temper might have prudently declined this invitation, the\r\nexcitement of his recent success carried him completely away. He placed\r\none of the guineas on a slab beside the reddleman\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign. \xe2\x80\x9cMine is\r\na guinea,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA guinea that\xe2\x80\x99s not your own,\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn sarcastically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my own,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Wildeve haughtily. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is my wife\xe2\x80\x99s, and what\r\nis hers is mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; let\xe2\x80\x99s make a beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d He shook the box, and threw eight,\r\nten, and nine; the three casts amounted to twenty-seven.\r\n\r\nThis encouraged Wildeve. He took the box; and his three casts amounted\r\nto forty-five.\r\n\r\nDown went another of the reddleman\xe2\x80\x99s sovereigns against his first one\r\nwhich Wildeve laid. This time Wildeve threw fifty-one points, but no\r\npair. The reddleman looked grim, threw a raffle of aces, and pocketed\r\nthe stakes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere you are again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve contemptuously. \xe2\x80\x9cDouble the stakes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe laid two of Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s guineas, and the reddleman his two pounds.\r\nVenn won again. New stakes were laid on the stone, and the gamblers\r\nproceeded as before.\r\n\r\nWildeve was a nervous and excitable man, and the game was beginning to\r\ntell upon his temper. He writhed, fumed, shifted his seat, and the\r\nbeating of his heart was almost audible. Venn sat with lips impassively\r\nclosed and eyes reduced to a pair of unimportant twinkles; he scarcely\r\nappeared to breathe. He might have been an Arab, or an automaton; he\r\nwould have been like a red sandstone statue but for the motion of his\r\narm with the dice-box.\r\n\r\nThe game fluctuated, now in favour of one, now in favour of the other,\r\nwithout any great advantage on the side of either. Nearly twenty\r\nminutes were passed thus. The light of the candle had by this time\r\nattracted heath-flies, moths, and other winged creatures of night,\r\nwhich floated round the lantern, flew into the flame, or beat about the\r\nfaces of the two players.\r\n\r\nBut neither of the men paid much attention to these things, their eyes\r\nbeing concentrated upon the little flat stone, which to them was an\r\narena vast and important as a battlefield. By this time a change had\r\ncome over the game; the reddleman won continually. At length sixty\r\nguineas\xe2\x80\x94Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s fifty, and ten of Clym\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94had passed into his hands.\r\nWildeve was reckless, frantic, exasperated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Won back his coat,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn slily.\r\n\r\nAnother throw, and the money went the same way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Won back his hat,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d continued Venn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Won back his watch, won back his money, and went out of the door a\r\nrich man,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d added Venn sentence by sentence, as stake after stake\r\npassed over to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive more!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Wildeve, dashing down the money. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd three casts\r\nbe hanged\xe2\x80\x94one shall decide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe red automaton opposite lapsed into silence, nodded, and followed\r\nhis example. Wildeve rattled the box, and threw a pair of sixes and\r\nfive points. He clapped his hands; \xe2\x80\x9cI have done it this time\xe2\x80\x94hurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are two playing, and only one has thrown,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reddleman,\r\nquietly bringing down the box. The eyes of each were then so intently\r\nconverged upon the stone that one could fancy their beams were visible,\r\nlike rays in a fog.\r\n\r\nVenn lifted the box, and behold a triplet of sixes was disclosed.\r\n\r\nWildeve was full of fury. While the reddleman was grasping the stakes\r\nWildeve seized the dice and hurled them, box and all, into the\r\ndarkness, uttering a fearful imprecation. Then he arose and began\r\nstamping up and down like a madman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all over, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Wildeve. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean to have another chance yet. I must!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my good man, what have you done with the dice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI threw them away\xe2\x80\x94it was a momentary irritation. What a fool I am!\r\nHere\xe2\x80\x94come and help me to look for them\xe2\x80\x94we must find them again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWildeve snatched up the lantern and began anxiously prowling among the\r\nfurze and fern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not likely to find them there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn, following. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\ndid you do such a crazy thing as that for? Here\xe2\x80\x99s the box. The dice\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be far off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWildeve turned the light eagerly upon the spot where Venn had found the\r\nbox, and mauled the herbage right and left. In the course of a few\r\nminutes one of the dice was found. They searched on for some time, but\r\nno other was to be seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve; \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s play with one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgreed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn.\r\n\r\nDown they sat again, and recommenced with single guinea stakes; and the\r\nplay went on smartly. But Fortune had unmistakably fallen in love with\r\nthe reddleman tonight. He won steadily, till he was the owner of\r\nfourteen more of the gold pieces. Seventy-nine of the hundred guineas\r\nwere his, Wildeve possessing only twenty-one. The aspect of the two\r\nopponents was now singular. Apart from motions, a complete diorama of\r\nthe fluctuations of the game went on in their eyes. A diminutive\r\ncandle-flame was mirrored in each pupil, and it would have been\r\npossible to distinguish therein between the moods of hope and the moods\r\nof abandonment, even as regards the reddleman, though his facial\r\nmuscles betrayed nothing at all. Wildeve played on with the\r\nrecklessness of despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly exclaimed, hearing a rustle; and they both\r\nlooked up.\r\n\r\nThey were surrounded by dusky forms between four and five feet high,\r\nstanding a few paces beyond the rays of the lantern. A moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninspection revealed that the encircling figures were heath-croppers,\r\ntheir heads being all towards the players, at whom they gazed intently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoosh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve, and the whole forty or fifty animals at once\r\nturned and galloped away. Play was again resumed.\r\n\r\nTen minutes passed away. Then a large death\xe2\x80\x99s head moth advanced from\r\nthe obscure outer air, wheeled twice round the lantern, flew straight\r\nat the candle, and extinguished it by the force of the blow. Wildeve\r\nhad just thrown, but had not lifted the box to see what he had cast;\r\nand now it was impossible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the infernal!\xe2\x80\x9d he shrieked. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, what shall we do? Perhaps I\r\nhave thrown six\xe2\x80\x94have you any matches?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristian had some\xe2\x80\x94I wonder where he is. Christian!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut there was no reply to Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s shout, save a mournful whining from\r\nthe herons which were nesting lower down the vale. Both men looked\r\nblankly round without rising. As their eyes grew accustomed to the\r\ndarkness they perceived faint greenish points of light among the grass\r\nand fern. These lights dotted the hillside like stars of a low\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94glowworms,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute. We can continue the\r\ngame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVenn sat still, and his companion went hither and thither till he had\r\ngathered thirteen glowworms\xe2\x80\x94as many as he could find in a space of four\r\nor five minutes\xe2\x80\x94upon a fox-glove leaf which he pulled for the purpose.\r\nThe reddleman vented a low humorous laugh when he saw his adversary\r\nreturn with these. \xe2\x80\x9cDetermined to go on, then?\xe2\x80\x9d he said drily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always am!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve angrily. And shaking the glowworms from the\r\nleaf he ranged them with a trembling hand in a circle on the stone,\r\nleaving a space in the middle for the descent of the dice-box, over\r\nwhich the thirteen tiny lamps threw a pale phosphoric shine. The game\r\nwas again renewed. It happened to be that season of the year at which\r\nglowworms put forth their greatest brilliancy, and the light they\r\nyielded was more than ample for the purpose, since it is possible on\r\nsuch nights to read the handwriting of a letter by the light of two or\r\nthree.\r\n\r\nThe incongruity between the men\xe2\x80\x99s deeds and their environment was\r\ngreat. Amid the soft juicy vegetation of the hollow in which they sat,\r\nthe motionless and the uninhabited solitude, intruded the chink of\r\nguineas, the rattle of dice, the exclamations of the reckless players.\r\n\r\nWildeve had lifted the box as soon as the lights were obtained, and the\r\nsolitary die proclaimed that the game was still against him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t play any more\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve been tampering with the dice,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nshouted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x94when they were your own?\xe2\x80\x9d said the reddleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll change the game: the lowest point shall win the stake\xe2\x80\x94it may cut\r\noff my ill luck. Do you refuse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94go on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, there they are again\xe2\x80\x94damn them!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Wildeve, looking up. The\r\nheath-croppers had returned noiselessly, and were looking on with erect\r\nheads just as before, their timid eyes fixed upon the scene, as if they\r\nwere wondering what mankind and candlelight could have to do in these\r\nhaunts at this untoward hour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a plague those creatures are\xe2\x80\x94staring at me so!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and\r\nflung a stone, which scattered them; when the game was continued as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nWildeve had now ten guineas left; and each laid five. Wildeve threw\r\nthree points; Venn two, and raked in the coins. The other seized the\r\ndie, and clenched his teeth upon it in sheer rage, as if he would bite\r\nit in pieces. \xe2\x80\x9cNever give in\xe2\x80\x94here are my last five!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, throwing\r\nthem down. \xe2\x80\x9cHang the glowworms\xe2\x80\x94they are going out. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you burn,\r\nyou little fools? Stir them up with a thorn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe probed the glowworms with a bit of stick, and rolled them over, till\r\nthe bright side of their tails was upwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s light enough. Throw on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn.\r\n\r\nWildeve brought down the box within the shining circle and looked\r\neagerly. He had thrown ace. \xe2\x80\x9cWell done!\xe2\x80\x94I said it would turn, and it\r\nhas turned.\xe2\x80\x9d Venn said nothing; but his hand shook slightly.\r\n\r\nHe threw ace also.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve. \xe2\x80\x9cCurse me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe die smacked the stone a second time. It was ace again. Venn looked\r\ngloomy, threw\xe2\x80\x94the die was seen to be lying in two pieces, the cleft\r\nsides uppermost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve thrown nothing at all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cServes me right\xe2\x80\x94I split the die with my teeth. Here\xe2\x80\x94take your money.\r\nBlank is less than one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it, I say\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve won it!\xe2\x80\x9d And Wildeve threw the stakes against\r\nthe reddleman\xe2\x80\x99s chest. Venn gathered them up, arose, and withdrew from\r\nthe hollow, Wildeve sitting stupefied.\r\n\r\nWhen he had come to himself he also arose, and, with the extinguished\r\nlantern in his hand, went towards the highroad. On reaching it he stood\r\nstill. The silence of night pervaded the whole heath except in one\r\ndirection; and that was towards Mistover. There he could hear the noise\r\nof light wheels, and presently saw two carriagelamps descending the\r\nhill. Wildeve screened himself under a bush and waited.\r\n\r\nThe vehicle came on and passed before him. It was a hired carriage, and\r\nbehind the coachman were two persons whom he knew well. There sat\r\nEustacia and Yeobright, the arm of the latter being round her waist.\r\nThey turned the sharp corner at the bottom towards the temporary home\r\nwhich Clym had hired and furnished, about five miles to the eastward.\r\n\r\nWildeve forgot the loss of the money at the sight of his lost love,\r\nwhose preciousness in his eyes was increasing in geometrical\r\nprogression with each new incident that reminded him of their hopeless\r\ndivision. Brimming with the subtilized misery that he was capable of\r\nfeeling, he followed the opposite way towards the inn.\r\n\r\nAbout the same moment that Wildeve stepped into the highway Venn also\r\nhad reached it at a point a hundred yards further on; and he, hearing\r\nthe same wheels, likewise waited till the carriage should come up. When\r\nhe saw who sat therein he seemed to be disappointed. Reflecting a\r\nminute or two, during which interval the carriage rolled on, he crossed\r\nthe road, and took a short cut through the furze and heath to a point\r\nwhere the turnpike road bent round in ascending a hill. He was now\r\nagain in front of the carriage, which presently came up at a walking\r\npace. Venn stepped forward and showed himself.\r\n\r\nEustacia started when the lamp shone upon him, and Clym\xe2\x80\x99s arm was\r\ninvoluntarily withdrawn from her waist. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Diggory? You\r\nare having a lonely walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I beg your pardon for stopping you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am waiting\r\nabout for Mrs. Wildeve: I have something to give her from Mrs.\r\nYeobright. Can you tell me if she\xe2\x80\x99s gone home from the party yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. But she will be leaving soon. You may possibly meet her at the\r\ncorner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVenn made a farewell obeisance, and walked back to his former position,\r\nwhere the byroad from Mistover joined the highway. Here he remained\r\nfixed for nearly half an hour, and then another pair of lights came\r\ndown the hill. It was the old-fashioned wheeled nondescript belonging\r\nto the captain, and Thomasin sat in it alone, driven by Charley.\r\n\r\nThe reddleman came up as they slowly turned the corner. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg pardon\r\nfor stopping you, Mrs. Wildeve,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I have something to give\r\nyou privately from Mrs. Yeobright.\xe2\x80\x9d He handed a small parcel; it\r\nconsisted of the hundred guineas he had just won, roughly twisted up in\r\na piece of paper.\r\n\r\nThomasin recovered from her surprise, and took the packet. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x94I wish you good night,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and vanished from her view.\r\n\r\nThus Venn, in his anxiety to rectify matters, had placed in Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands not only the fifty guineas which rightly belonged to her, but\r\nalso the fifty intended for her cousin Clym. His mistake had been based\r\nupon Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s words at the opening of the game, when he indignantly\r\ndenied that the guinea was not his own. It had not been comprehended by\r\nthe reddleman that at halfway through the performance the game was\r\ncontinued with the money of another person; and it was an error which\r\nafterwards helped to cause more misfortune than treble the loss in\r\nmoney value could have done.\r\n\r\nThe night was now somewhat advanced; and Venn plunged deeper into the\r\nheath, till he came to a ravine where his van was standing\xe2\x80\x94a spot not\r\nmore than two hundred yards from the site of the gambling bout. He\r\nentered this movable home of his, lit his lantern, and, before closing\r\nhis door for the night, stood reflecting on the circumstances of the\r\npreceding hours. While he stood the dawn grew visible in the northeast\r\nquarter of the heavens, which, the clouds having cleared off, was\r\nbright with a soft sheen at this midsummer time, though it was only\r\nbetween one and two o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Venn, thoroughly weary, then shut his door\r\nand flung himself down to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK FOURTH\xe2\x80\x94THE CLOSED DOOR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\nThe Rencounter by the Pool\r\n\r\n\r\nThe July sun shone over Egdon and fired its crimson heather to scarlet.\r\nIt was the one season of the year, and the one weather of the season,\r\nin which the heath was gorgeous. This flowering period represented the\r\nsecond or noontide division in the cycle of those superficial changes\r\nwhich alone were possible here; it followed the green or young-fern\r\nperiod, representing the morn, and preceded the brown period, when the\r\nheathbells and ferns would wear the russet tinges of evening; to be in\r\nturn displaced by the dark hue of the winter period, representing\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nClym and Eustacia, in their little house at Alderworth, beyond East\r\nEgdon, were living on with a monotony which was delightful to them. The\r\nheath and changes of weather were quite blotted out from their eyes for\r\nthe present. They were enclosed in a sort of luminous mist, which hid\r\nfrom them surroundings of any inharmonious colour, and gave to all\r\nthings the character of light. When it rained they were charmed,\r\nbecause they could remain indoors together all day with such a show of\r\nreason; when it was fine they were charmed, because they could sit\r\ntogether on the hills. They were like those double stars which revolve\r\nround and round each other, and from a distance appear to be one. The\r\nabsolute solitude in which they lived intensified their reciprocal\r\nthoughts; yet some might have said that it had the disadvantage of\r\nconsuming their mutual affections at a fearfully prodigal rate.\r\nYeobright did not fear for his own part; but recollection of Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nold speech about the evanescence of love, now apparently forgotten by\r\nher, sometimes caused him to ask himself a question; and he recoiled at\r\nthe thought that the quality of finiteness was not foreign to Eden.\r\n\r\nWhen three or four weeks had been passed thus, Yeobright resumed his\r\nreading in earnest. To make up for lost time he studied indefatigably,\r\nfor he wished to enter his new profession with the least possible\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nNow, Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s dream had always been that, once married to Clym, she\r\nwould have the power of inducing him to return to Paris. He had\r\ncarefully withheld all promise to do so; but would he be proof against\r\nher coaxing and argument? She had calculated to such a degree on the\r\nprobability of success that she had represented Paris, and not\r\nBudmouth, to her grandfather as in all likelihood their future home.\r\nHer hopes were bound up in this dream. In the quiet days since their\r\nmarriage, when Yeobright had been poring over her lips, her eyes, and\r\nthe lines of her face, she had mused and mused on the subject, even\r\nwhile in the act of returning his gaze; and now the sight of the books,\r\nindicating a future which was antagonistic to her dream, struck her\r\nwith a positively painful jar. She was hoping for the time when, as the\r\nmistress of some pretty establishment, however small, near a Parisian\r\nBoulevard, she would be passing her days on the skirts at least of the\r\ngay world, and catching stray wafts from those town pleasures she was\r\nso well fitted to enjoy. Yet Yeobright was as firm in the contrary\r\nintention as if the tendency of marriage were rather to develop the\r\nfantasies of young philanthropy than to sweep them away.\r\n\r\nHer anxiety reached a high pitch; but there was something in Clym\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nundeviating manner which made her hesitate before sounding him on the\r\nsubject. At this point in their experience, however, an incident helped\r\nher. It occurred one evening about six weeks after their union, and\r\narose entirely out of the unconscious misapplication of Venn of the\r\nfifty guineas intended for Yeobright.\r\n\r\nA day or two after the receipt of the money Thomasin had sent a note to\r\nher aunt to thank her. She had been surprised at the largeness of the\r\namount; but as no sum had ever been mentioned she set that down to her\r\nlate uncle\xe2\x80\x99s generosity. She had been strictly charged by her aunt to\r\nsay nothing to her husband of this gift; and Wildeve, as was natural\r\nenough, had not brought himself to mention to his wife a single\r\nparticular of the midnight scene in the heath. Christian\xe2\x80\x99s terror, in\r\nlike manner, had tied his tongue on the share he took in that\r\nproceeding; and hoping that by some means or other the money had gone\r\nto its proper destination, he simply asserted as much, without giving\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when a week or two had passed away, Mrs. Yeobright began to\r\nwonder why she never heard from her son of the receipt of the present;\r\nand to add gloom to her perplexity came the possibility that resentment\r\nmight be the cause of his silence. She could hardly believe as much,\r\nbut why did he not write? She questioned Christian, and the confusion\r\nin his answers would at once have led her to believe that something was\r\nwrong, had not one-half of his story been corroborated by Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnote.\r\n\r\nMrs. Yeobright was in this state of uncertainty when she was informed\r\none morning that her son\xe2\x80\x99s wife was visiting her grandfather at\r\nMistover. She determined to walk up the hill, see Eustacia, and\r\nascertain from her daughter-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s lips whether the family guineas,\r\nwhich were to Mrs. Yeobright what family jewels are to wealthier\r\ndowagers, had miscarried or not.\r\n\r\nWhen Christian learnt where she was going his concern reached its\r\nheight. At the moment of her departure he could prevaricate no longer,\r\nand, confessing to the gambling, told her the truth as far as he knew\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94that the guineas had been won by Wildeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, is he going to keep them?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Yeobright cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope and trust not!\xe2\x80\x9d moaned Christian. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a good man, and perhaps\r\nwill do right things. He said you ought to have gied Mr. Clym\xe2\x80\x99s share\r\nto Eustacia, and that\xe2\x80\x99s perhaps what he\xe2\x80\x99ll do himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. Yeobright, as soon as she could calmly reflect, there was much\r\nlikelihood in this, for she could hardly believe that Wildeve would\r\nreally appropriate money belonging to her son. The intermediate course\r\nof giving it to Eustacia was the sort of thing to please Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfancy. But it filled the mother with anger none the less. That Wildeve\r\nshould have got command of the guineas after all, and should rearrange\r\nthe disposal of them, placing Clym\xe2\x80\x99s share in Clym\xe2\x80\x99s wife\xe2\x80\x99s hands,\r\nbecause she had been his own sweetheart, and might be so still, was as\r\nirritating a pain as any that Mrs. Yeobright had ever borne.\r\n\r\nShe instantly dismissed the wretched Christian from her employ for his\r\nconduct in the affair; but, feeling quite helpless and unable to do\r\nwithout him, told him afterwards that he might stay a little longer if\r\nhe chose. Then she hastened off to Eustacia, moved by a much less\r\npromising emotion towards her daughter-in-law than she had felt half an\r\nhour earlier, when planning her journey. At that time it was to inquire\r\nin a friendly spirit if there had been any accidental loss; now it was\r\nto ask plainly if Wildeve had privately given her money which had been\r\nintended as a sacred gift to Clym.\r\n\r\nShe started at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and her meeting with Eustacia was hastened\r\nby the appearance of the young lady beside the pool and bank which\r\nbordered her grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s premises, where she stood surveying the\r\nscene, and perhaps thinking of the romantic enactments it had witnessed\r\nin past days. When Mrs. Yeobright approached, Eustacia surveyed her\r\nwith the calm stare of a stranger.\r\n\r\nThe mother-in-law was the first to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cI was coming to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia with surprise, for Mrs. Yeobright, much to the\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s mortification, had refused to be present at the wedding. \xe2\x80\x9cI did\r\nnot at all expect you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was coming on business only,\xe2\x80\x9d said the visitor, more coldly than at\r\nfirst. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you excuse my asking this\xe2\x80\x94Have you received a gift from\r\nThomasin\xe2\x80\x99s husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA gift?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean money!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94I myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I meant yourself, privately\xe2\x80\x94though I was not going to put it in\r\nthat way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoney from Mr. Wildeve? No\xe2\x80\x94never! Madam, what do you mean by that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nEustacia fired up all too quickly, for her own consciousness of the old\r\nattachment between herself and Wildeve led her to jump to the\r\nconclusion that Mrs. Yeobright also knew of it, and might have come to\r\naccuse her of receiving dishonourable presents from him now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI simply ask the question,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to have better opinions of me\xe2\x80\x94I feared you were against me\r\nfrom the first!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Eustacia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I was simply for Clym,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Yeobright, with too much\r\nemphasis in her earnestness. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the instinct of everyone to look\r\nafter their own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you imply that he required guarding against me?\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nEustacia, passionate tears in her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not injured him by\r\nmarrying him! What sin have I done that you should think so ill of me?\r\nYou had no right to speak against me to him when I have never wronged\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only did what was fair under the circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright\r\nmore softly. \xe2\x80\x9cI would rather not have gone into this question at\r\npresent, but you compel me. I am not ashamed to tell you the honest\r\ntruth. I was firmly convinced that he ought not to marry you\xe2\x80\x94therefore\r\nI tried to dissuade him by all the means in my power. But it is done\r\nnow, and I have no idea of complaining any more. I am ready to welcome\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes, it is very well to see things in that business point of\r\nview,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Eustacia with a smothered fire of feeling. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why\r\nshould you think there is anything between me and Mr. Wildeve? I have a\r\nspirit as well as you. I am indignant; and so would any woman be. It\r\nwas a condescension in me to be Clym\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and not a man\xc5\x93uvre, let me\r\nremind you; and therefore I will not be treated as a schemer whom it\r\nbecomes necessary to bear with because she has crept into the family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright, vainly endeavouring to control her anger. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave never heard anything to show that my son\xe2\x80\x99s lineage is not as good\r\nas the Vyes\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94perhaps better. It is amusing to hear you talk of\r\ncondescension.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was condescension, nevertheless,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia vehemently. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if\r\nI had known then what I know now, that I should be living in this wild\r\nheath a month after my marriage, I\xe2\x80\x94I should have thought twice before\r\nagreeing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be better not to say that; it might not sound truthful. I am\r\nnot aware that any deception was used on his part\xe2\x80\x94I know there was\r\nnot\xe2\x80\x94whatever might have been the case on the other side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is too exasperating!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the younger woman huskily, her\r\nface crimsoning, and her eyes darting light. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you dare to speak\r\nto me like that? I insist upon repeating to you that had I known that\r\nmy life would from my marriage up to this time have been as it is, I\r\nshould have said _No_. I don\xe2\x80\x99t complain. I have never uttered a sound\r\nof such a thing to him; but it is true. I hope therefore that in the\r\nfuture you will be silent on my eagerness. If you injure me now you\r\ninjure yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInjure you? Do you think I am an evil-disposed person?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou injured me before my marriage, and you have now suspected me of\r\nsecretly favouring another man for money!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could not help what I thought. But I have never spoken of you\r\noutside my house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou spoke of me within it, to Clym, and you could not do worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did my duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll do mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA part of which will possibly be to set him against his mother. It is\r\nalways so. But why should I not bear it as others have borne it before\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia, breathless with emotion. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think\r\nme capable of every bad thing. Who can be worse than a wife who\r\nencourages a lover, and poisons her husband\xe2\x80\x99s mind against his\r\nrelative? Yet that is now the character given to me. Will you not come\r\nand drag him out of my hands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Yeobright gave back heat for heat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t rage at me, madam! It ill becomes your beauty, and I am not\r\nworth the injury you may do it on my account, I assure you. I am only a\r\npoor old woman who has lost a son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had treated me honourably you would have had him still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nEustacia said, while scalding tears trickled from her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have\r\nbrought yourself to folly; you have caused a division which can never\r\nbe healed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have done nothing. This audacity from a young woman is more than I\r\ncan bear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was asked for; you have suspected me, and you have made me speak of\r\nmy husband in a way I would not have done. You will let him know that I\r\nhave spoken thus, and it will cause misery between us. Will you go away\r\nfrom me? You are no friend!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go when I have spoken a word. If anyone says I have come here\r\nto question you without good grounds for it, that person speaks\r\nuntruly. If anyone says that I attempted to stop your marriage by any\r\nbut honest means, that person, too, does not speak the truth. I have\r\nfallen on an evil time; God has been unjust to me in letting you insult\r\nme! Probably my son\xe2\x80\x99s happiness does not lie on this side of the grave,\r\nfor he is a foolish man who neglects the advice of his parent. You,\r\nEustacia, stand on the edge of a precipice without knowing it. Only\r\nshow my son one-half the temper you have shown me today\xe2\x80\x94and you may\r\nbefore long\xe2\x80\x94and you will find that though he is as gentle as a child\r\nwith you now, he can be as hard as steel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe excited mother then withdrew, and Eustacia, panting, stood looking\r\ninto the pool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\nHe Is Set upon by Adversities but He Sings a Song\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result of that unpropitious interview was that Eustacia, instead of\r\npassing the afternoon with her grandfather, hastily returned home to\r\nClym, where she arrived three hours earlier than she had been expected.\r\n\r\nShe came indoors with her face flushed, and her eyes still showing\r\ntraces of her recent excitement. Yeobright looked up astonished; he had\r\nnever seen her in any way approaching to that state before. She passed\r\nhim by, and would have gone upstairs unnoticed, but Clym was so\r\nconcerned that he immediately followed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter, Eustacia?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. She was standing on the\r\nhearthrug in the bedroom, looking upon the floor, her hands clasped in\r\nfront of her, her bonnet yet unremoved. For a moment she did not\r\nanswer; and then she replied in a low voice\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen your mother; and I will never see her again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA weight fell like a stone upon Clym. That same morning, when Eustacia\r\nhad arranged to go and see her grandfather, Clym had expressed a wish\r\nthat she would drive down to Blooms-End and inquire for her\r\nmother-in-law, or adopt any other means she might think fit to bring\r\nabout a reconciliation. She had set out gaily; and he had hoped for\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is this?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell\xe2\x80\x94I cannot remember. I met your mother. And I will never\r\nmeet her again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I know about Mr. Wildeve now? I won\xe2\x80\x99t have wicked opinions\r\npassed on me by anybody. O! it was too humiliating to be asked if I had\r\nreceived any money from him, or encouraged him, or something of the\r\nsort\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly know what!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could she have asked you that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen there must have been some meaning in it. What did my mother say\r\nbesides?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what she said, except in so far as this, that we both\r\nsaid words which can never be forgiven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there must be some misapprehension. Whose fault was it that her\r\nmeaning was not made clear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather not say. It may have been the fault of the\r\ncircumstances, which were awkward at the very least. O Clym\xe2\x80\x94I cannot\r\nhelp expressing it\xe2\x80\x94this is an unpleasant position that you have placed\r\nme in. But you must improve it\xe2\x80\x94yes, say you will\xe2\x80\x94for I hate it all now!\r\nYes, take me to Paris, and go on with your old occupation, Clym! I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mind how humbly we live there at first, if it can only be Paris,\r\nand not Egdon Heath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have quite given up that idea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yeobright, with surprise.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely I never led you to expect such a thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI own it. Yet there are thoughts which cannot be kept out of mind, and\r\nthat one was mine. Must I not have a voice in the matter, now I am your\r\nwife and the sharer of your doom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there are things which are placed beyond the pale of discussion;\r\nand I thought this was specially so, and by mutual agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClym, I am unhappy at what I hear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a low voice; and her\r\neyes drooped, and she turned away.\r\n\r\nThis indication of an unexpected mine of hope in Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s bosom\r\ndisconcerted her husband. It was the first time that he had confronted\r\nthe fact of the indirectness of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s movement towards her desire.\r\nBut his intention was unshaken, though he loved Eustacia well. All the\r\neffect that her remark had upon him was a resolve to chain himself more\r\nclosely than ever to his books, so as to be the sooner enabled to\r\nappeal to substantial results from another course in arguing against\r\nher whim.\r\n\r\nNext day the mystery of the guineas was explained. Thomasin paid them a\r\nhurried visit, and Clym\xe2\x80\x99s share was delivered up to him by her own\r\nhands. Eustacia was not present at the time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen this is what my mother meant,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Clym. \xe2\x80\x9cThomasin, do you\r\nknow that they have had a bitter quarrel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a little more reticence now than formerly in Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmanner towards her cousin. It is the effect of marriage to engender in\r\nseveral directions some of the reserve it annihilates in one. \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\nmother told me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe came back to my house after\r\nseeing Eustacia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe worst thing I dreaded has come to pass. Was Mother much disturbed\r\nwhen she came to you, Thomasin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClym leant his elbow upon the post of the garden gate, and covered his\r\neyes with his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t trouble about it, Clym. They may get to be friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cNot two people with inflammable natures like\r\ntheirs. Well, what must be will be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing is cheerful in it\xe2\x80\x94the guineas are not lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather have lost them twice over than have had this happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAmid these jarring events Yeobright felt one thing to be\r\nindispensable\xe2\x80\x94that he should speedily make some show of progress in his\r\nscholastic plans. With this view he read far into the small hours\r\nduring many nights.\r\n\r\nOne morning, after a severer strain than usual, he awoke with a strange\r\nsensation in his eyes. The sun was shining directly upon the\r\nwindow-blind, and at his first glance thitherward a sharp pain obliged\r\nhim to close his eyelids quickly. At every new attempt to look about\r\nhim the same morbid sensibility to light was manifested, and\r\nexcoriating tears ran down his cheeks. He was obliged to tie a bandage\r\nover his brow while dressing; and during the day it could not be\r\nabandoned. Eustacia was thoroughly alarmed. On finding that the case\r\nwas no better the next morning they decided to send to Anglebury for a\r\nsurgeon.\r\n\r\nTowards evening he arrived, and pronounced the disease to be acute\r\ninflammation induced by Clym\xe2\x80\x99s night studies, continued in spite of a\r\ncold previously caught, which had weakened his eyes for the time.\r\n\r\nFretting with impatience at this interruption to a task he was so\r\nanxious to hasten, Clym was transformed into an invalid. He was shut up\r\nin a room from which all light was excluded, and his condition would\r\nhave been one of absolute misery had not Eustacia read to him by the\r\nglimmer of a shaded lamp. He hoped that the worst would soon be over;\r\nbut at the surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s third visit he learnt to his dismay that although\r\nhe might venture out of doors with shaded eyes in the course of a\r\nmonth, all thought of pursuing his work, or of reading print of any\r\ndescription, would have to be given up for a long time to come.\r\n\r\nOne week and another week wore on, and nothing seemed to lighten the\r\ngloom of the young couple. Dreadful imaginings occurred to Eustacia,\r\nbut she carefully refrained from uttering them to her husband. Suppose\r\nhe should become blind, or, at all events, never recover sufficient\r\nstrength of sight to engage in an occupation which would be congenial\r\nto her feelings, and conduce to her removal from this lonely dwelling\r\namong the hills? That dream of beautiful Paris was not likely to cohere\r\ninto substance in the presence of this misfortune. As day after day\r\npassed by, and he got no better, her mind ran more and more in this\r\nmournful groove, and she would go away from him into the garden and\r\nweep despairing tears.\r\n\r\nYeobright thought he would send for his mother; and then he thought he\r\nwould not. Knowledge of his state could only make her the more unhappy;\r\nand the seclusion of their life was such that she would hardly be\r\nlikely to learn the news except through a special messenger.\r\nEndeavouring to take the trouble as philosophically as possible, he\r\nwaited on till the third week had arrived, when he went into the open\r\nair for the first time since the attack. The surgeon visited him again\r\nat this stage, and Clym urged him to express a distinct opinion. The\r\nyoung man learnt with added surprise that the date at which he might\r\nexpect to resume his labours was as uncertain as ever, his eyes being\r\nin that peculiar state which, though affording him sight enough for\r\nwalking about, would not admit of their being strained upon any\r\ndefinite object without incurring the risk of reproducing ophthalmia in\r\nits acute form.\r\n\r\nClym was very grave at the intelligence, but not despairing. A quiet\r\nfirmness, and even cheerfulness, took possession of him. He was not to\r\nbe blind; that was enough. To be doomed to behold the world through\r\nsmoked glass for an indefinite period was bad enough, and fatal to any\r\nkind of advance; but Yeobright was an absolute stoic in the face of\r\nmishaps which only affected his social standing; and, apart from\r\nEustacia, the humblest walk of life would satisfy him if it could be\r\nmade to work in with some form of his culture scheme. To keep a cottage\r\nnight-school was one such form; and his affliction did not master his\r\nspirit as it might otherwise have done.\r\n\r\nHe walked through the warm sun westward into those tracts of Egdon with\r\nwhich he was best acquainted, being those lying nearer to his old home.\r\nHe saw before him in one of the valleys the gleaming of whetted iron,\r\nand advancing, dimly perceived that the shine came from the tool of a\r\nman who was cutting furze. The worker recognized Clym, and Yeobright\r\nlearnt from the voice that the speaker was Humphrey.\r\n\r\nHumphrey expressed his sorrow at Clym\xe2\x80\x99s condition, and added, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, if\r\nyours was low-class work like mine, you could go on with it just the\r\nsame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I could,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yeobright musingly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much do you get for\r\ncutting these faggots?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf-a-crown a hundred, and in these long days I can live very well on\r\nthe wages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s walk home to Alderworth he was lost in\r\nreflections which were not of an unpleasant kind. On his coming up to\r\nthe house Eustacia spoke to him from the open window, and he went\r\nacross to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDarling,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am much happier. And if my mother were\r\nreconciled to me and to you I should, I think, be happy quite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear that will never be,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking afar with her beautiful\r\nstormy eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cHow _can_ you say \xe2\x80\x98I am happier,\xe2\x80\x99 and nothing changed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt arises from my having at last discovered something I can do, and\r\nget a living at, in this time of misfortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to be a furze- and turf-cutter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Clym!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, the slight hopefulness previously apparent in her\r\nface going off again, and leaving her worse than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely I shall. Is it not very unwise in us to go on spending the\r\nlittle money we\xe2\x80\x99ve got when I can keep down expenditures by an honest\r\noccupation? The outdoor exercise will do me good, and who knows but\r\nthat in a few months I shall be able to go on with my reading again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my grandfather offers to assist us, if we require assistance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t require it. If I go furze-cutting we shall be fairly well\r\noff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn comparison with slaves, and the Israelites in Egypt, and such\r\npeople!\xe2\x80\x9d A bitter tear rolled down Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s face, which he did not\r\nsee. There had been nonchalance in his tone, showing her that he felt\r\nno absolute grief at a consummation which to her was a positive horror.\r\n\r\nThe very next day Yeobright went to Humphrey\xe2\x80\x99s cottage, and borrowed of\r\nhim leggings, gloves, a whetstone, and a hook, to use till he should be\r\nable to purchase some for himself. Then he sallied forth with his new\r\nfellow-labourer and old acquaintance, and selecting a spot where the\r\nfurze grew thickest he struck the first blow in his adopted calling.\r\nHis sight, like the wings in Rasselas, though useless to him for his\r\ngrand purpose, sufficed for this strait, and he found that when a\r\nlittle practice should have hardened his palms against blistering he\r\nwould be able to work with ease.\r\n\r\nDay after day he rose with the sun, buckled on his leggings, and went\r\noff to the rendezvous with Humphrey. His custom was to work from four\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning till noon; then, when the heat of the day was at\r\nits highest, to go home and sleep for an hour or two; afterwards coming\r\nout again and working till dusk at nine.\r\n\r\nThis man from Paris was now so disguised by his leather accoutrements,\r\nand by the goggles he was obliged to wear over his eyes, that his\r\nclosest friend might have passed by without recognizing him. He was a\r\nbrown spot in the midst of an expanse of olive-green gorse, and nothing\r\nmore. Though frequently depressed in spirit when not actually at work,\r\nowing to thoughts of Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s position and his mother\xe2\x80\x99s estrangement,\r\nwhen in the full swing of labour he was cheerfully disposed and calm.\r\n\r\nHis daily life was of a curious microscopic sort, his whole world being\r\nlimited to a circuit of a few feet from his person. His familiars were\r\ncreeping and winged things, and they seemed to enroll him in their\r\nband. Bees hummed around his ears with an intimate air, and tugged at\r\nthe heath and furze-flowers at his side in such numbers as to weigh\r\nthem down to the sod. The strange amber-coloured butterflies which\r\nEgdon produced, and which were never seen elsewhere, quivered in the\r\nbreath of his lips, alighted upon his bowed back, and sported with the\r\nglittering point of his hook as he flourished it up and down. Tribes of\r\nemerald-green grasshoppers leaped over his feet, falling awkwardly on\r\ntheir backs, heads, or hips, like unskilful acrobats, as chance might\r\nrule; or engaged themselves in noisy flirtations under the fern-fronds\r\nwith silent ones of homely hue. Huge flies, ignorant of larders and\r\nwire-netting, and quite in a savage state, buzzed about him without\r\nknowing that he was a man. In and out of the fern-dells snakes glided\r\nin their most brilliant blue and yellow guise, it being the season\r\nimmediately following the shedding of their old skins, when their\r\ncolours are brightest. Litters of young rabbits came out from their\r\nforms to sun themselves upon hillocks, the hot beams blazing through\r\nthe delicate tissue of each thin-fleshed ear, and firing it to a\r\nblood-red transparency in which the veins could be seen. None of them\r\nfeared him.\r\n\r\nThe monotony of his occupation soothed him, and was in itself a\r\npleasure. A forced limitation of effort offered a justification of\r\nhomely courses to an unambitious man, whose conscience would hardly\r\nhave allowed him to remain in such obscurity while his powers were\r\nunimpeded. Hence Yeobright sometimes sang to himself, and when obliged\r\nto accompany Humphrey in search of brambles for faggot-bonds he would\r\namuse his companion with sketches of Parisian life and character, and\r\nso while away the time.\r\n\r\nOn one of these warm afternoons Eustacia walked out alone in the\r\ndirection of Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s place of work. He was busily chopping away at\r\nthe furze, a long row of faggots which stretched downward from his\r\nposition representing the labour of the day. He did not observe her\r\napproach, and she stood close to him, and heard his undercurrent of\r\nsong. It shocked her. To see him there, a poor afflicted man, earning\r\nmoney by the sweat of his brow, had at first moved her to tears; but to\r\nhear him sing and not at all rebel against an occupation which, however\r\nsatisfactory to himself, was degrading to her, as an educated\r\nlady-wife, wounded her through. Unconscious of her presence, he still\r\nwent on singing:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLe point du jour\r\nA nos bosquets rend toute leur parure;\r\nFlore est plus belle \xc3\xa0 son retour;\r\nL\xe2\x80\x99oiseau reprend doux chant d\xe2\x80\x99amour;\r\nTout c\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8bre dans la nature\r\nLe point du jour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLe point du jour\r\nCause parfois, cause douleur extr\xc3\xaame;\r\nQue l\xe2\x80\x99espace des nuits est court\r\nPour le berger br\xc3\xbblant d\xe2\x80\x99amour,\r\nForc\xc3\xa9 de quitter ce qu\xe2\x80\x99il aime\r\nAu point du jour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was bitterly plain to Eustacia that he did not care much about\r\nsocial failure; and the proud fair woman bowed her head and wept in\r\nsick despair at thought of the blasting effect upon her own life of\r\nthat mood and condition in him. Then she came forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would starve rather than do it!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed vehemently. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\r\ncan sing! I will go and live with my grandfather again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEustacia! I did not see you, though I noticed something moving,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid gently. He came forward, pulled off his huge leather glove, and\r\ntook her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you speak in such a strange way? It is only a\r\nlittle old song which struck my fancy when I was in Paris, and now just\r\napplies to my life with you. Has your love for me all died, then,\r\nbecause my appearance is no longer that of a fine gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest, you must not question me unpleasantly, or it may make me not\r\nlove you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you believe it possible that I would run the risk of doing that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you follow out your own ideas, and won\xe2\x80\x99t give in to mine when I\r\nwish you to leave off this shameful labour. Is there anything you\r\ndislike in me that you act so contrarily to my wishes? I am your wife,\r\nand why will you not listen? Yes, I am your wife indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what that tone means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat tone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tone in which you said, \xe2\x80\x98Your wife indeed.\xe2\x80\x99 It meant, \xe2\x80\x98Your wife,\r\nworse luck.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is hard in you to probe me with that remark. A woman may have\r\nreason, though she is not without heart, and if I felt \xe2\x80\x98worse luck,\xe2\x80\x99 it\r\nwas no ignoble feeling\xe2\x80\x94it was only too natural. There, you see that at\r\nany rate I do not attempt untruths. Do you remember how, before we were\r\nmarried, I warned you that I had not good wifely qualities?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mock me to say that now. On that point at least the only noble\r\ncourse would be to hold your tongue, for you are still queen of me,\r\nEustacia, though I may no longer be king of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are my husband. Does not that content you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot unless you are my wife without regret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot answer you. I remember saying that I should be a serious\r\nmatter on your hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I saw that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you were too quick to see! No true lover would have seen any such\r\nthing; you are too severe upon me, Clym\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t like your speaking so\r\nat all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I married you in spite of it, and don\xe2\x80\x99t regret doing so. How\r\ncold you seem this afternoon! and yet I used to think there never was a\r\nwarmer heart than yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I fear we are cooling\xe2\x80\x94I see it as well as you,\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed\r\nmournfully. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how madly we loved two months ago! You were never\r\ntired of contemplating me, nor I of contemplating you. Who could have\r\nthought then that by this time my eyes would not seem so very bright to\r\nyours, nor your lips so very sweet to mine? Two months\xe2\x80\x94is it possible?\r\nYes, \xe2\x80\x99tis too true!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou sigh, dear, as if you were sorry for it; and that\xe2\x80\x99s a hopeful\r\nsign.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I don\xe2\x80\x99t sigh for that. There are other things for me to sigh for,\r\nor any other woman in my place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat your chances in life are ruined by marrying in haste an\r\nunfortunate man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy will you force me, Clym, to say bitter things? I deserve pity as\r\nmuch as you. As much?\xe2\x80\x94I think I deserve it more. For you can sing! It\r\nwould be a strange hour which should catch me singing under such a\r\ncloud as this! Believe me, sweet, I could weep to a degree that would\r\nastonish and confound such an elastic mind as yours. Even had you felt\r\ncareless about your own affliction, you might have refrained from\r\nsinging out of sheer pity for mine. God! if I were a man in such a\r\nposition I would curse rather than sing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYeobright placed his hand upon her arm. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t you suppose, my\r\ninexperienced girl, that I cannot rebel, in high Promethean fashion,\r\nagainst the gods and fate as well as you. I have felt more steam and\r\nsmoke of that sort than you have ever heard of. But the more I see of\r\nlife the more do I perceive that there is nothing particularly great in\r\nits greatest walks, and therefore nothing particularly small in mine of\r\nfurze-cutting. If I feel that the greatest blessings vouchsafed to us\r\nare not very valuable, how can I feel it to be any great hardship when\r\nthey are taken away? So I sing to pass the time. Have you indeed lost\r\nall tenderness for me, that you begrudge me a few cheerful moments?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have still some tenderness left for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour words have no longer their old flavour. And so love dies with\r\ngood fortune!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot listen to this, Clym\xe2\x80\x94it will end bitterly,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a\r\nbroken voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI will go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nShe Goes Out to Battle against Depression\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days later, before the month of August had expired, Eustacia and\r\nYeobright sat together at their early dinner.\r\n\r\nEustacia\xe2\x80\x99s manner had become of late almost apathetic. There was a\r\nforlorn look about her beautiful eyes which, whether she deserved it or\r\nnot, would have excited pity in the breast of anyone who had known her\r\nduring the full flush of her love for Clym. The feelings of husband and\r\nwife varied, in some measure, inversely with their positions. Clym, the\r\nafflicted man, was cheerful; and he even tried to comfort her, who had\r\nnever felt a moment of physical suffering in her whole life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, brighten up, dearest; we shall be all right again. Some day\r\nperhaps I shall see as well as ever. And I solemnly promise that I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nleave off cutting furze as soon as I have the power to do anything\r\nbetter. You cannot seriously wish me to stay idling at home all day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is so dreadful\xe2\x80\x94a furze-cutter! and you a man who have lived\r\nabout the world, and speak French, and German, and who are fit for what\r\nis so much better than this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose when you first saw me and heard about me I was wrapped in a\r\nsort of golden halo to your eyes\xe2\x80\x94a man who knew glorious things, and\r\nhad mixed in brilliant scenes\xe2\x80\x94in short, an adorable, delightful,\r\ndistracting hero?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, sobbing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now I am a poor fellow in brown leather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t taunt me. But enough of this. I will not be depressed any more.\r\nI am going from home this afternoon, unless you greatly object. There\r\nis to be a village picnic\xe2\x80\x94a gipsying, they call it\xe2\x80\x94at East Egdon, and I\r\nshall go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo dance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? You can sing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, as you will. Must I come to fetch you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you return soon enough from your work. But do not inconvenience\r\nyourself about it. I know the way home, and the heath has no terror for\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd can you cling to gaiety so eagerly as to walk all the way to a\r\nvillage festival in search of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, you don\xe2\x80\x99t like my going alone! Clym, you are not jealous?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. But I would come with you if it could give you any pleasure;\r\nthough, as things stand, perhaps you have too much of me already.\r\nStill, I somehow wish that you did not want to go. Yes, perhaps I am\r\njealous; and who could be jealous with more reason than I, a half-blind\r\nman, over such a woman as you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think like it. Let me go, and don\xe2\x80\x99t take all my spirits away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather lose all my own, my sweet wife. Go and do whatever you\r\nlike. Who can forbid your indulgence in any whim? You have all my heart\r\nyet, I believe; and because you bear with me, who am in truth a drag\r\nupon you, I owe you thanks. Yes, go alone and shine. As for me, I will\r\nstick to my doom. At that kind of meeting people would shun me. My hook\r\nand gloves are like the St. Lazarus rattle of the leper, warning the\r\nworld to get out of the way of a sight that would sadden them.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nkissed her, put on his leggings, and went out.\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone she rested her head upon her hands and said to\r\nherself, \xe2\x80\x9cTwo wasted lives\xe2\x80\x94his and mine. And I am come to this! Will it\r\ndrive me out of my mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe cast about for any possible course which offered the least\r\nimprovement on the existing state of things, and could find none. She\r\nimagined how all those Budmouth ones who should learn what had become\r\nof her would say, \xe2\x80\x9cLook at the girl for whom nobody was good enough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nTo Eustacia the situation seemed such a mockery of her hopes that death\r\nappeared the only door of relief if the satire of Heaven should go much\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she aroused herself and exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll shake it off.\r\nYes, I _will_ shake it off! No one shall know my suffering. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nbitterly merry, and ironically gay, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll laugh in derision. And\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll begin by going to this dance on the green.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe ascended to her bedroom and dressed herself with scrupulous care.\r\nTo an onlooker her beauty would have made her feelings almost seem\r\nreasonable. The gloomy corner into which accident as much as\r\nindiscretion had brought this woman might have led even a moderate\r\npartisan to feel that she had cogent reasons for asking the Supreme\r\nPower by what right a being of such exquisite finish had been placed in\r\ncircumstances calculated to make of her charms a curse rather than a\r\nblessing.\r\n\r\nIt was five in the afternoon when she came out from the house ready for\r\nher walk. There was material enough in the picture for twenty new\r\nconquests. The rebellious sadness that was rather too apparent when she\r\nsat indoors without a bonnet was cloaked and softened by her outdoor\r\nattire, which always had a sort of nebulousness about it, devoid of\r\nharsh edges anywhere; so that her face looked from its environment as\r\nfrom a cloud, with no noticeable lines of demarcation between flesh and\r\nclothes. The heat of the day had scarcely declined as yet, and she went\r\nalong the sunny hills at a leisurely pace, there being ample time for\r\nher idle expedition. Tall ferns buried her in their leafage whenever\r\nher path lay through them, which now formed miniature forests, though\r\nnot one stem of them would remain to bud the next year.\r\n\r\nThe site chosen for the village festivity was one of the lawnlike oases\r\nwhich were occasionally, yet not often, met with on the plateaux of the\r\nheath district. The brakes of furze and fern terminated abruptly round\r\nthe margin, and the grass was unbroken. A green cattletrack skirted the\r\nspot, without, however, emerging from the screen of fern, and this path\r\nEustacia followed, in order to reconnoitre the group before joining it.\r\nThe lusty notes of the East Egdon band had directed her unerringly, and\r\nshe now beheld the musicians themselves, sitting in a blue wagon with\r\nred wheels scrubbed as bright as new, and arched with sticks, to which\r\nboughs and flowers were tied. In front of this was the grand central\r\ndance of fifteen or twenty couples, flanked by minor dances of inferior\r\nindividuals whose gyrations were not always in strict keeping with the\r\ntune.\r\n\r\nThe young men wore blue and white rosettes, and with a flush on their\r\nfaces footed it to the girls, who, with the excitement and the\r\nexercise, blushed deeper than the pink of their numerous ribbons. Fair\r\nones with long curls, fair ones with short curls, fair ones with\r\nlovelocks, fair ones with braids, flew round and round; and a beholder\r\nmight well have wondered how such a prepossessing set of young women of\r\nlike size, age, and disposition, could have been collected together\r\nwhere there were only one or two villages to choose from. In the\r\nbackground was one happy man dancing by himself, with closed eyes,\r\ntotally oblivious of all the rest. A fire was burning under a pollard\r\nthorn a few paces off, over which three kettles hung in a row. Hard by\r\nwas a table where elderly dames prepared tea, but Eustacia looked among\r\nthem in vain for the cattle-dealer\xe2\x80\x99s wife who had suggested that she\r\nshould come, and had promised to obtain a courteous welcome for her.\r\n\r\nThis unexpected absence of the only local resident whom Eustacia knew\r\nconsiderably damaged her scheme for an afternoon of reckless gaiety.\r\nJoining in became a matter of difficulty, notwithstanding that, were\r\nshe to advance, cheerful dames would come forward with cups of tea and\r\nmake much of her as a stranger of superior grace and knowledge to\r\nthemselves. Having watched the company through the figures of two\r\ndances, she decided to walk a little further, to a cottage where she\r\nmight get some refreshment, and then return homeward in the shady time\r\nof evening.\r\n\r\nThis she did, and by the time that she retraced her steps towards the\r\nscene of the gipsying, which it was necessary to repass on her way to\r\nAlderworth, the sun was going down. The air was now so still that she\r\ncould hear the band afar off, and it seemed to be playing with more\r\nspirit, if that were possible, than when she had come away. On reaching\r\nthe hill the sun had quite disappeared; but this made little difference\r\neither to Eustacia or to the revellers, for a round yellow moon was\r\nrising before her, though its rays had not yet outmastered those from\r\nthe west. The dance was going on just the same, but strangers had\r\narrived and formed a ring around the figure, so that Eustacia could\r\nstand among these without a chance of being recognized.\r\n\r\nA whole village-full of sensuous emotion, scattered abroad all the year\r\nlong, surged here in a focus for an hour. The forty hearts of those\r\nwaving couples were beating as they had not done since, twelve months\r\nbefore, they had come together in similar jollity. For the time\r\npaganism was revived in their hearts, the pride of life was all in all,\r\nand they adored none other than themselves.\r\n\r\nHow many of those impassioned but temporary embraces were destined to\r\nbecome perpetual was possibly the wonder of some of those who indulged\r\nin them, as well as of Eustacia who looked on. She began to envy those\r\npirouetters, to hunger for the hope and happiness which the fascination\r\nof the dance seemed to engender within them. Desperately fond of\r\ndancing herself, one of Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s expectations of Paris had been the\r\nopportunity it might afford her of indulgence in this favourite\r\npastime. Unhappily, that expectation was now extinct within her for\r\never.\r\n\r\nWhilst she abstractedly watched them spinning and fluctuating in the\r\nincreasing moonlight she suddenly heard her name whispered by a voice\r\nover her shoulder. Turning in surprise, she beheld at her elbow one\r\nwhose presence instantly caused her to flush to the temples.\r\n\r\nIt was Wildeve. Till this moment he had not met her eye since the\r\nmorning of his marriage, when she had been loitering in the church, and\r\nhad startled him by lifting her veil and coming forward to sign the\r\nregister as witness. Yet why the sight of him should have instigated\r\nthat sudden rush of blood she could not tell.\r\n\r\nBefore she could speak he whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you like dancing as much as\r\never?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I do,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you dance with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a great change for me; but will it not seem strange?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat strangeness can there be in relations dancing together?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94yes, relations. Perhaps none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like to be seen, pull down your veil; though there\r\nis not much risk of being known by this light. Lots of strangers are\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did as he suggested; and the act was a tacit acknowledgment that\r\nshe accepted his offer.\r\n\r\nWildeve gave her his arm and took her down on the outside of the ring\r\nto the bottom of the dance, which they entered. In two minutes more\r\nthey were involved in the figure and began working their way upwards to\r\nthe top. Till they had advanced halfway thither Eustacia wished more\r\nthan once that she had not yielded to his request; from the middle to\r\nthe top she felt that, since she had come out to seek pleasure, she was\r\nonly doing a natural thing to obtain it. Fairly launched into the\r\nceaseless glides and whirls which their new position as top couple\r\nopened up to them, Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s pulses began to move too quickly for long\r\nrumination of any kind.\r\n\r\nThrough the length of five-and-twenty couples they threaded their giddy\r\nway, and a new vitality entered her form. The pale ray of evening lent\r\na fascination to the experience. There is a certain degree and tone of\r\nlight which tends to disturb the equilibrium of the senses, and to\r\npromote dangerously the tenderer moods; added to movement, it drives\r\nthe emotions to rankness, the reason becoming sleepy and unperceiving\r\nin inverse proportion; and this light fell now upon these two from the\r\ndisc of the moon. All the dancing girls felt the symptoms, but Eustacia\r\nmost of all. The grass under their feet became trodden away, and the\r\nhard, beaten surface of the sod, when viewed aslant towards the\r\nmoonlight, shone like a polished table. The air became quite still, the\r\nflag above the wagon which held the musicians clung to the pole, and\r\nthe players appeared only in outline against the sky; except when the\r\ncircular mouths of the trombone, ophicleide, and French horn gleamed\r\nout like huge eyes from the shade of their figures. The pretty dresses\r\nof the maids lost their subtler day colours and showed more or less of\r\na misty white. Eustacia floated round and round on Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s arm, her\r\nface rapt and statuesque; her soul had passed away from and forgotten\r\nher features, which were left empty and quiescent, as they always are\r\nwhen feeling goes beyond their register.\r\n\r\nHow near she was to Wildeve! it was terrible to think of. She could\r\nfeel his breathing, and he, of course, could feel hers. How badly she\r\nhad treated him! yet, here they were treading one measure. The\r\nenchantment of the dance surprised her. A clear line of difference\r\ndivided like a tangible fence her experience within this maze of motion\r\nfrom her experience without it. Her beginning to dance had been like a\r\nchange of atmosphere; outside, she had been steeped in arctic frigidity\r\nby comparison with the tropical sensations here. She had entered the\r\ndance from the troubled hours of her late life as one might enter a\r\nbrilliant chamber after a night walk in a wood. Wildeve by himself\r\nwould have been merely an agitation; Wildeve added to the dance, and\r\nthe moonlight, and the secrecy, began to be a delight. Whether his\r\npersonality supplied the greater part of this sweetly compounded\r\nfeeling, or whether the dance and the scene weighed the more therein,\r\nwas a nice point upon which Eustacia herself was entirely in a cloud.\r\n\r\nPeople began to say \xe2\x80\x9cWho are they?\xe2\x80\x9d but no invidious inquiries were\r\nmade. Had Eustacia mingled with the other girls in their ordinary daily\r\nwalks the case would have been different: here she was not\r\ninconvenienced by excessive inspection, for all were wrought to their\r\nbrightest grace by the occasion. Like the planet Mercury surrounded by\r\nthe lustre of sunset, her permanent brilliancy passed without much\r\nnotice in the temporary glory of the situation.\r\n\r\nAs for Wildeve, his feelings are easy to guess. Obstacles were a\r\nripening sun to his love, and he was at this moment in a delirium of\r\nexquisite misery. To clasp as his for five minutes what was another\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s through all the rest of the year was a kind of thing he of all\r\nmen could appreciate. He had long since begun to sigh again for\r\nEustacia; indeed, it may be asserted that signing the marriage register\r\nwith Thomasin was the natural signal to his heart to return to its\r\nfirst quarters, and that the extra complication of Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s marriage\r\nwas the one addition required to make that return compulsory.\r\n\r\nThus, for different reasons, what was to the rest an exhilarating\r\nmovement was to these two a riding upon the whirlwind. The dance had\r\ncome like an irresistible attack upon whatever sense of social order\r\nthere was in their minds, to drive them back into old paths which were\r\nnow doubly irregular. Through three dances in succession they spun\r\ntheir way; and then, fatigued with the incessant motion, Eustacia\r\nturned to quit the circle in which she had already remained too long.\r\nWildeve led her to a grassy mound a few yards distant, where she sat\r\ndown, her partner standing beside her. From the time that he addressed\r\nher at the beginning of the dance till now they had not exchanged a\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dance and the walking have tired you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said tenderly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; not greatly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is strange that we should have met here of all places, after\r\nmissing each other so long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have missed because we tried to miss, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. But you began that proceeding\xe2\x80\x94by breaking a promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is scarcely worth while to talk of that now. We have formed other\r\nties since then\xe2\x80\x94you no less than I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to hear that your husband is ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not ill\xe2\x80\x94only incapacitated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94that is what I mean. I sincerely sympathize with you in your\r\ntrouble. Fate has treated you cruelly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was silent awhile. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard that he has chosen to work as a\r\nfurze-cutter?\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a low, mournful voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has been mentioned to me,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Wildeve hesitatingly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\nhardly believed it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true. What do you think of me as a furze-cutter\xe2\x80\x99s wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think the same as ever of you, Eustacia. Nothing of that sort can\r\ndegrade you\xe2\x80\x94you ennoble the occupation of your husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could feel it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there any chance of Mr. Yeobright getting better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe thinks so. I doubt it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was quite surprised to hear that he had taken a cottage. I thought,\r\nin common with other people, that he would have taken you off to a home\r\nin Paris immediately after you had married him. \xe2\x80\x98What a gay, bright\r\nfuture she has before her!\xe2\x80\x99 I thought. He will, I suppose, return there\r\nwith you, if his sight gets strong again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nObserving that she did not reply he regarded her more closely. She was\r\nalmost weeping. Images of a future never to be enjoyed, the revived\r\nsense of her bitter disappointment, the picture of the neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuspended ridicule which was raised by Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s words, had been too\r\nmuch for proud Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s equanimity.\r\n\r\nWildeve could hardly control his own too forward feelings when he saw\r\nher silent perturbation. But he affected not to notice this, and she\r\nsoon recovered her calmness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not intend to walk home by yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat could hurt me on this heath, who have\r\nnothing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy diverging a little I can make my way home the same as yours. I\r\nshall be glad to keep you company as far as Throope Corner.\xe2\x80\x9d Seeing\r\nthat Eustacia sat on in hesitation he added, \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you think it\r\nunwise to be seen in the same road with me after the events of last\r\nsummer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I think no such thing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said haughtily. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall accept\r\nwhose company I choose, for all that may be said by the miserable\r\ninhabitants of Egdon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen let us walk on\xe2\x80\x94if you are ready. Our nearest way is towards that\r\nholly bush with the dark shadow that you see down there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEustacia arose, and walked beside him in the direction signified,\r\nbrushing her way over the damping heath and fern, and followed by the\r\nstrains of the merrymakers, who still kept up the dance. The moon had\r\nnow waxed bright and silvery, but the heath was proof against such\r\nillumination, and there was to be observed the striking scene of a\r\ndark, rayless tract of country under an atmosphere charged from its\r\nzenith to its extremities with whitest light. To an eye above them\r\ntheir two faces would have appeared amid the expanse like two pearls on\r\na table of ebony.\r\n\r\nOn this account the irregularities of the path were not visible, and\r\nWildeve occasionally stumbled; whilst Eustacia found it necessary to\r\nperform some graceful feats of balancing whenever a small tuft of\r\nheather or root of furze protruded itself through the grass of the\r\nnarrow track and entangled her feet. At these junctures in her progress\r\na hand was invariably stretched forward to steady her, holding her\r\nfirmly until smooth ground was again reached, when the hand was again\r\nwithdrawn to a respectful distance.\r\n\r\nThey performed the journey for the most part in silence, and drew near\r\nto Throope Corner, a few hundred yards from which a short path branched\r\naway to Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s house. By degrees they discerned coming towards them\r\na pair of human figures, apparently of the male sex.\r\n\r\nWhen they came a little nearer Eustacia broke the silence by saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of those men is my husband. He promised to come to meet me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the other is my greatest enemy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks like Diggory Venn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is an awkward meeting,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cbut such is my fortune. He knows\r\ntoo much about me, unless he could know more, and so prove to himself\r\nthat what he now knows counts for nothing. Well, let it be\xe2\x80\x94you must\r\ndeliver me up to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will think twice before you direct me to do that. Here is a man\r\nwho has not forgotten an item in our meetings at Rainbarrow\xe2\x80\x94he is in\r\ncompany with your husband. Which of them, seeing us together here, will\r\nbelieve that our meeting and dancing at the gipsy party was by chance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered gloomily. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave me before they come up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWildeve bade her a tender farewell, and plunged across the fern and\r\nfurze, Eustacia slowly walking on. In two or three minutes she met her\r\nhusband and his companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy journey ends here for tonight, reddleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yeobright as soon\r\nas he perceived her. \xe2\x80\x9cI turn back with this lady. Good night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood night, Mr. Yeobright,\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope to see you better\r\nsoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe moonlight shone directly upon Venn\xe2\x80\x99s face as he spoke, and revealed\r\nall its lines to Eustacia. He was looking suspiciously at her. That\r\nVenn\xe2\x80\x99s keen eye had discerned what Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s feeble vision had not\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nman in the act of withdrawing from Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s side\xe2\x80\x94was within the\r\nlimits of the probable.\r\n\r\nIf Eustacia had been able to follow the reddleman she would soon have\r\nfound striking confirmation of her thought. No sooner had Clym given\r\nher his arm and led her off the scene than the reddleman turned back\r\nfrom the beaten track towards East Egdon, whither he had been strolling\r\nmerely to accompany Clym in his walk, Diggory\xe2\x80\x99s van being again in the\r\nneighbourhood. Stretching out his long legs, he crossed the pathless\r\nportion of the heath somewhat in the direction which Wildeve had taken.\r\nOnly a man accustomed to nocturnal rambles could at this hour have\r\ndescended those shaggy slopes with Venn\xe2\x80\x99s velocity without falling\r\nheadlong into a pit, or snapping off his leg by jamming his foot into\r\nsome rabbit burrow. But Venn went on without much inconvenience to\r\nhimself, and the course of his scamper was towards the Quiet Woman Inn.\r\nThis place he reached in about half an hour, and he was well aware that\r\nno person who had been near Throope Corner when he started could have\r\ngot down here before him.\r\n\r\nThe lonely inn was not yet closed, though scarcely an individual was\r\nthere, the business done being chiefly with travellers who passed the\r\ninn on long journeys, and these had now gone on their way. Venn went to\r\nthe public room, called for a mug of ale, and inquired of the maid in\r\nan indifferent tone if Mr. Wildeve was at home.\r\n\r\nThomasin sat in an inner room and heard Venn\xe2\x80\x99s voice. When customers\r\nwere present she seldom showed herself, owing to her inherent dislike\r\nfor the business; but perceiving that no one else was there tonight she\r\ncame out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not at home yet, Diggory,\xe2\x80\x9d she said pleasantly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I expected\r\nhim sooner. He has been to East Egdon to buy a horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he wear a light wideawake?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I saw him at Throope Corner, leading one home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn drily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA beauty, with a white face and a mane as black as night. He will soon\r\nbe here, no doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d Rising and looking for a moment at the pure, sweet\r\nface of Thomasin, over which a shadow of sadness had passed since the\r\ntime when he had last seen her, he ventured to add, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Wildeve seems\r\nto be often away at this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Thomasin in what was intended to be a tone of gaiety.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHusbands will play the truant, you know. I wish you could tell me of\r\nsome secret plan that would help me to keep him home at my will in the\r\nevenings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will consider if I know of one,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Venn in that same light\r\ntone which meant no lightness. And then he bowed in a manner of his own\r\ninvention and moved to go. Thomasin offered him her hand; and without a\r\nsigh, though with food for many, the reddleman went out.\r\n\r\nWhen Wildeve returned, a quarter of an hour later Thomasin said simply,\r\nand in the abashed manner usual with her now, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the horse,\r\nDamon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I have not bought it, after all. The man asks too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut somebody saw you at Throope Corner leading it home\xe2\x80\x94a beauty, with\r\na white face and a mane as black as night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve, fixing his eyes upon her; \xe2\x80\x9cwho told you that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVenn the reddleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe expression of Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s face became curiously condensed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is a\r\nmistake\xe2\x80\x94it must have been someone else,\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly and testily,\r\nfor he perceived that Venn\xe2\x80\x99s countermoves had begun again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nRough Coercion Is Employed\r\n\r\n\r\nThose words of Thomasin, which seemed so little, but meant so much,\r\nremained in the ears of Diggory Venn: \xe2\x80\x9cHelp me to keep him home in the\r\nevenings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Venn had arrived on Egdon Heath only to cross to the\r\nother side\xe2\x80\x94he had no further connection with the interests of the\r\nYeobright family, and he had a business of his own to attend to. Yet he\r\nsuddenly began to feel himself drifting into the old track of\r\nman\xc5\x93uvring on Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s account.\r\n\r\nHe sat in his van and considered. From Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s words and manner he\r\nhad plainly gathered that Wildeve neglected her. For whom could he\r\nneglect her if not for Eustacia? Yet it was scarcely credible that\r\nthings had come to such a head as to indicate that Eustacia\r\nsystematically encouraged him. Venn resolved to reconnoitre somewhat\r\ncarefully the lonely road which led along the vale from Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndwelling to Clym\xe2\x80\x99s house at Alderworth.\r\n\r\nAt this time, as has been seen, Wildeve was quite innocent of any\r\npredetermined act of intrigue, and except at the dance on the green he\r\nhad not once met Eustacia since her marriage. But that the spirit of\r\nintrigue was in him had been shown by a recent romantic habit of his\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nhabit of going out after dark and strolling towards Alderworth, there\r\nlooking at the moon and stars, looking at Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s house, and walking\r\nback at leisure.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when watching on the night after the festival, the\r\nreddleman saw him ascend by the little path, lean over the front gate\r\nof Clym\xe2\x80\x99s garden, sigh, and turn to go back again. It was plain that\r\nWildeve\xe2\x80\x99s intrigue was rather ideal than real. Venn retreated before\r\nhim down the hill to a place where the path was merely a deep groove\r\nbetween the heather; here he mysteriously bent over the ground for a\r\nfew minutes, and retired. When Wildeve came on to that spot his ankle\r\nwas caught by something, and he fell headlong.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had recovered the power of respiration he sat up and\r\nlistened. There was not a sound in the gloom beyond the spiritless stir\r\nof the summer wind. Feeling about for the obstacle which had flung him\r\ndown, he discovered that two tufts of heath had been tied together\r\nacross the path, forming a loop, which to a traveller was certain\r\noverthrow. Wildeve pulled off the string that bound them, and went on\r\nwith tolerable quickness. On reaching home he found the cord to be of a\r\nreddish colour. It was just what he had expected.\r\n\r\nAlthough his weaknesses were not specially those akin to physical fear,\r\nthis species of coup-de-Jarnac from one he knew too well troubled the\r\nmind of Wildeve. But his movements were unaltered thereby. A night or\r\ntwo later he again went along the vale to Alderworth, taking the\r\nprecaution of keeping out of any path. The sense that he was watched,\r\nthat craft was employed to circumvent his errant tastes, added piquancy\r\nto a journey so entirely sentimental, so long as the danger was of no\r\nfearful sort. He imagined that Venn and Mrs. Yeobright were in league,\r\nand felt that there was a certain legitimacy in combating such a\r\ncoalition.\r\n\r\nThe heath tonight appeared to be totally deserted; and Wildeve, after\r\nlooking over Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s garden gate for some little time, with a cigar\r\nin his mouth, was tempted by the fascination that emotional smuggling\r\nhad for his nature to advance towards the window, which was not quite\r\nclosed, the blind being only partly drawn down. He could see into the\r\nroom, and Eustacia was sitting there alone. Wildeve contemplated her\r\nfor a minute, and then retreating into the heath beat the ferns\r\nlightly, whereupon moths flew out alarmed. Securing one, he returned to\r\nthe window, and holding the moth to the chink, opened his hand. The\r\nmoth made towards the candle upon Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s table, hovered round it\r\ntwo or three times, and flew into the flame.\r\n\r\nEustacia started up. This had been a well-known signal in old times\r\nwhen Wildeve had used to come secretly wooing to Mistover. She at once\r\nknew that Wildeve was outside, but before she could consider what to do\r\nher husband came in from upstairs. Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s face burnt crimson at the\r\nunexpected collision of incidents, and filled it with an animation that\r\nit too frequently lacked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a very high colour, dearest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yeobright, when he came\r\nclose enough to see it. \xe2\x80\x9cYour appearance would be no worse if it were\r\nalways so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am warm,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I will go into the air for a few\r\nminutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I go with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no. I am only going to the gate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe arose, but before she had time to get out of the room a loud\r\nrapping began upon the front door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia in an unusually quick tone for her;\r\nand she glanced eagerly towards the window whence the moth had flown;\r\nbut nothing appeared there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better not at this time of the evening,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Clym stepped\r\nbefore her into the passage, and Eustacia waited, her somnolent manner\r\ncovering her inner heat and agitation.\r\n\r\nShe listened, and Clym opened the door. No words were uttered outside,\r\nand presently he closed it and came back, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNobody was there. I\r\nwonder what that could have meant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was left to wonder during the rest of the evening, for no\r\nexplanation offered itself, and Eustacia said nothing, the additional\r\nfact that she knew of only adding more mystery to the performance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a little drama had been acted outside which saved Eustacia\r\nfrom all possibility of compromising herself that evening at least.\r\nWhilst Wildeve had been preparing his moth-signal another person had\r\ncome behind him up to the gate. This man, who carried a gun in his\r\nhand, looked on for a moment at the other\xe2\x80\x99s operation by the window,\r\nwalked up to the house, knocked at the door, and then vanished round\r\nthe corner and over the hedge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn him!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has been watching me again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs his signal had been rendered futile by this uproarious rapping\r\nWildeve withdrew, passed out at the gate, and walked quickly down the\r\npath without thinking of anything except getting away unnoticed.\r\nHalfway down the hill the path ran near a knot of stunted hollies,\r\nwhich in the general darkness of the scene stood as the pupil in a\r\nblack eye. When Wildeve reached this point a report startled his ear,\r\nand a few spent gunshots fell among the leaves around him.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt that he himself was the cause of that gun\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndischarge; and he rushed into the clump of hollies, beating the bushes\r\nfuriously with his stick; but nobody was there. This attack was a more\r\nserious matter than the last, and it was some time before Wildeve\r\nrecovered his equanimity. A new and most unpleasant system of menace\r\nhad begun, and the intent appeared to be to do him grievous bodily\r\nharm. Wildeve had looked upon Venn\xe2\x80\x99s first attempt as a species of\r\nhorseplay, which the reddleman had indulged in for want of knowing\r\nbetter; but now the boundary line was passed which divides the annoying\r\nfrom the perilous.\r\n\r\nHad Wildeve known how thoroughly in earnest Venn had become he might\r\nhave been still more alarmed. The reddleman had been almost exasperated\r\nby the sight of Wildeve outside Clym\xe2\x80\x99s house, and he was prepared to go\r\nto any lengths short of absolutely shooting him, to terrify the young\r\ninnkeeper out of his recalcitrant impulses. The doubtful legitimacy of\r\nsuch rough coercion did not disturb the mind of Venn. It troubles few\r\nsuch minds in such cases, and sometimes this is not to be regretted.\r\nFrom the impeachment of Strafford to Farmer Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s short way with the\r\nscamps of Virginia there have been many triumphs of justice which are\r\nmockeries of law.\r\n\r\nAbout half a mile below Clym\xe2\x80\x99s secluded dwelling lay a hamlet where\r\nlived one of the two constables who preserved the peace in the parish\r\nof Alderworth, and Wildeve went straight to the constable\xe2\x80\x99s cottage.\r\nAlmost the first thing that he saw on opening the door was the\r\nconstable\xe2\x80\x99s truncheon hanging to a nail, as if to assure him that here\r\nwere the means to his purpose. On inquiry, however, of the constable\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife he learnt that the constable was not at home. Wildeve said he\r\nwould wait.\r\n\r\nThe minutes ticked on, and the constable did not arrive. Wildeve cooled\r\ndown from his state of high indignation to a restless dissatisfaction\r\nwith himself, the scene, the constable\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and the whole set of\r\ncircumstances. He arose and left the house. Altogether, the experience\r\nof that evening had had a cooling, not to say a chilling, effect on\r\nmisdirected tenderness, and Wildeve was in no mood to ramble again to\r\nAlderworth after nightfall in hope of a stray glance from Eustacia.\r\n\r\nThus far the reddleman had been tolerably successful in his rude\r\ncontrivances for keeping down Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s inclination to rove in the\r\nevening. He had nipped in the bud the possible meeting between Eustacia\r\nand her old lover this very night. But he had not anticipated that the\r\ntendency of his action would be to divert Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s movement rather\r\nthan to stop it. The gambling with the guineas had not conduced to make\r\nhim a welcome guest to Clym; but to call upon his wife\xe2\x80\x99s relative was\r\nnatural, and he was determined to see Eustacia. It was necessary to\r\nchoose some less untoward hour than ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night. \xe2\x80\x9cSince it is\r\nunsafe to go in the evening,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go by day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Venn had left the heath and gone to call upon Mrs. Yeobright,\r\nwith whom he had been on friendly terms since she had learnt what a\r\nprovidential countermove he had made towards the restitution of the\r\nfamily guineas. She wondered at the lateness of his call, but had no\r\nobjection to see him.\r\n\r\nHe gave her a full account of Clym\xe2\x80\x99s affliction, and of the state in\r\nwhich he was living; then, referring to Thomasin, touched gently upon\r\nthe apparent sadness of her days. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, depend upon it,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cyou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do a better thing for either of \xe2\x80\x99em than to make\r\nyourself at home in their houses, even if there should be a little\r\nrebuff at first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth she and my son disobeyed me in marrying; therefore I have no\r\ninterest in their households. Their troubles are of their own making.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMrs. Yeobright tried to speak severely; but the account of her son\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstate had moved her more than she cared to show.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour visits would make Wildeve walk straighter than he is inclined to\r\ndo, and might prevent unhappiness down the heath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw something tonight out there which I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like at all. I wish\r\nyour son\xe2\x80\x99s house and Mr. Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s were a hundred miles apart instead\r\nof four or five.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen there _was_ an understanding between him and Clym\xe2\x80\x99s wife when he\r\nmade a fool of Thomasin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll hope there\xe2\x80\x99s no understanding now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd our hope will probably be very vain. O Clym! O Thomasin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no harm done yet. In fact, I\xe2\x80\x99ve persuaded Wildeve to mind his\r\nown business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, not by talking\xe2\x80\x94by a plan of mine called the silent system.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll succeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall if you help me by calling and making friends with your son.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have a chance then of using your eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, since it has come to this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Yeobright sadly, \xe2\x80\x9cI will\r\nown to you, reddleman, that I thought of going. I should be much\r\nhappier if we were reconciled. The marriage is unalterable, my life may\r\nbe cut short, and I should wish to die in peace. He is my only son; and\r\nsince sons are made of such stuff I am not sorry I have no other. As\r\nfor Thomasin, I never expected much from her; and she has not\r\ndisappointed me. But I forgave her long ago; and I forgive him now.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this very time of the reddleman\xe2\x80\x99s conversation with Mrs. Yeobright\r\nat Blooms-End another conversation on the same subject was languidly\r\nproceeding at Alderworth.\r\n\r\nAll the day Clym had borne himself as if his mind were too full of its\r\nown matter to allow him to care about outward things, and his words now\r\nshowed what had occupied his thoughts. It was just after the mysterious\r\nknocking that he began the theme. \xe2\x80\x9cSince I have been away today,\r\nEustacia, I have considered that something must be done to heal up this\r\nghastly breach between my dear mother and myself. It troubles me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you propose to do?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia abstractedly, for she could\r\nnot clear away from her the excitement caused by Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s recent\r\nman\xc5\x93uvre for an interview.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to take a very mild interest in what I propose, little or\r\nmuch,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym, with tolerable warmth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mistake me,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, reviving at his reproach. \xe2\x80\x9cI am only\r\nthinking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPartly of that moth whose skeleton is getting burnt up in the wick of\r\nthe candle,\xe2\x80\x9d she said slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you know I always take an interest\r\nin what you say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, dear. Then I think I must go and call upon her.\xe2\x80\x9d ...He went\r\non with tender feeling: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a thing I am not at all too proud to do,\r\nand only a fear that I might irritate her has kept me away so long. But\r\nI must do something. It is wrong in me to allow this sort of thing to\r\ngo on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you to blame yourself about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is getting old, and her life is lonely, and I am her only son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has Thomasin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThomasin is not her daughter; and if she were that would not excuse\r\nme. But this is beside the point. I have made up my mind to go to her,\r\nand all I wish to ask you is whether you will do your best to help\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94that is, forget the past; and if she shows her willingness to be\r\nreconciled, meet her halfway by welcoming her to our house, or by\r\naccepting a welcome to hers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt first Eustacia closed her lips as if she would rather do anything on\r\nthe whole globe than what he suggested. But the lines of her mouth\r\nsoftened with thought, though not so far as they might have softened,\r\nand she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will put nothing in your way; but after what has\r\npassed it is asking too much that I go and make advances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never distinctly told me what did pass between you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could not do it then, nor can I now. Sometimes more bitterness is\r\nsown in five minutes than can be got rid of in a whole life; and that\r\nmay be the case here.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused a few moments, and added, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you had\r\nnever returned to your native place, Clym, what a blessing it would\r\nhave been for you!... It has altered the destinies of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive,\xe2\x80\x9d Eustacia thought; but she kept that in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\nThe Journey across the Heath\r\n\r\n\r\nThursday, the thirty-first of August, was one of a series of days\r\nduring which snug houses were stifling, and when cool draughts were\r\ntreats; when cracks appeared in clayey gardens, and were called\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cearthquakes\xe2\x80\x9d by apprehensive children; when loose spokes were\r\ndiscovered in the wheels of carts and carriages; and when stinging\r\ninsects haunted the air, the earth, and every drop of water that was to\r\nbe found.\r\n\r\nIn Mrs. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s garden large-leaved plants of a tender kind flagged\r\nby ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning; rhubarb bent downward at eleven; and\r\neven stiff cabbages were limp by noon.\r\n\r\nIt was about eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock on this day that Mrs. Yeobright started\r\nacross the heath towards her son\xe2\x80\x99s house, to do her best in getting\r\nreconciled with him and Eustacia, in conformity with her words to the\r\nreddleman. She had hoped to be well advanced in her walk before the\r\nheat of the day was at its highest, but after setting out she found\r\nthat this was not to be done. The sun had branded the whole heath with\r\nits mark, even the purple heath-flowers having put on a brownness under\r\nthe dry blazes of the few preceding days. Every valley was filled with\r\nair like that of a kiln, and the clean quartz sand of the winter\r\nwater-courses, which formed summer paths, had undergone a species of\r\nincineration since the drought had set in.\r\n\r\nIn cool, fresh weather Mrs. Yeobright would have found no inconvenience\r\nin walking to Alderworth, but the present torrid attack made the\r\njourney a heavy undertaking for a woman past middle age; and at the end\r\nof the third mile she wished that she had hired Fairway to drive her a\r\nportion at least of the distance. But from the point at which she had\r\narrived it was as easy to reach Clym\xe2\x80\x99s house as to get home again. So\r\nshe went on, the air around her pulsating silently, and oppressing the\r\nearth with lassitude. She looked at the sky overhead, and saw that the\r\nsapphirine hue of the zenith in spring and early summer had been\r\nreplaced by a metallic violet.\r\n\r\nOccasionally she came to a spot where independent worlds of ephemerons\r\nwere passing their time in mad carousal, some in the air, some on the\r\nhot ground and vegetation, some in the tepid and stringy water of a\r\nnearly dried pool. All the shallower ponds had decreased to a vaporous\r\nmud amid which the maggoty shapes of innumerable obscure creatures\r\ncould be indistinctly seen, heaving and wallowing with enjoyment. Being\r\na woman not disinclined to philosophize she sometimes sat down under\r\nher umbrella to rest and to watch their happiness, for a certain\r\nhopefulness as to the result of her visit gave ease to her mind, and\r\nbetween important thoughts left it free to dwell on any infinitesimal\r\nmatter which caught her eyes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Yeobright had never before been to her son\xe2\x80\x99s house, and its exact\r\nposition was unknown to her. She tried one ascending path and another,\r\nand found that they led her astray. Retracing her steps, she came again\r\nto an open level, where she perceived at a distance a man at work. She\r\nwent towards him and inquired the way.\r\n\r\nThe labourer pointed out the direction, and added, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you see that\r\nfurze-cutter, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, going up that footpath yond?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Yeobright strained her eyes, and at last said that she did\r\nperceive him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you follow him you can make no mistake. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to the\r\nsame place, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe followed the figure indicated. He appeared of a russet hue, not\r\nmore distinguishable from the scene around him than the green\r\ncaterpillar from the leaf it feeds on. His progress when actually\r\nwalking was more rapid than Mrs. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s; but she was enabled to\r\nkeep at an equable distance from him by his habit of stopping whenever\r\nhe came to a brake of brambles, where he paused awhile. On coming in\r\nher turn to each of these spots she found half a dozen long limp\r\nbrambles which he had cut from the bush during his halt and laid out\r\nstraight beside the path. They were evidently intended for furze-faggot\r\nbonds which he meant to collect on his return.\r\n\r\nThe silent being who thus occupied himself seemed to be of no more\r\naccount in life than an insect. He appeared as a mere parasite of the\r\nheath, fretting its surface in his daily labour as a moth frets a\r\ngarment, entirely engrossed with its products, having no knowledge of\r\nanything in the world but fern, furze, heath, lichens, and moss.\r\n\r\nThe furze-cutter was so absorbed in the business of his journey that he\r\nnever turned his head; and his leather-legged and gauntleted form at\r\nlength became to her as nothing more than a moving handpost to show her\r\nthe way. Suddenly she was attracted to his individuality by observing\r\npeculiarities in his walk. It was a gait she had seen somewhere before;\r\nand the gait revealed the man to her, as the gait of Ahimaaz in the\r\ndistant plain made him known to the watchman of the king. \xe2\x80\x9cHis walk is\r\nexactly as my husband\xe2\x80\x99s used to be,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; and then the thought\r\nburst upon her that the furze-cutter was her son.\r\n\r\nShe was scarcely able to familiarize herself with this strange reality.\r\nShe had been told that Clym was in the habit of cutting furze, but she\r\nhad supposed that he occupied himself with the labour only at odd\r\ntimes, by way of useful pastime; yet she now beheld him as a\r\nfurze-cutter and nothing more\xe2\x80\x94wearing the regulation dress of the\r\ncraft, and thinking the regulation thoughts, to judge by his motions.\r\nPlanning a dozen hasty schemes for at once preserving him and Eustacia\r\nfrom this mode of life, she throbbingly followed the way, and saw him\r\nenter his own door.\r\n\r\nAt one side of Clym\xe2\x80\x99s house was a knoll, and on the top of the knoll a\r\nclump of fir trees so highly thrust up into the sky that their foliage\r\nfrom a distance appeared as a black spot in the air above the crown of\r\nthe hill. On reaching this place Mrs. Yeobright felt distressingly\r\nagitated, weary, and unwell. She ascended, and sat down under their\r\nshade to recover herself, and to consider how best to break the ground\r\nwith Eustacia, so as not to irritate a woman underneath whose apparent\r\nindolence lurked passions even stronger and more active than her own.\r\n\r\nThe trees beneath which she sat were singularly battered, rude, and\r\nwild, and for a few minutes Mrs. Yeobright dismissed thoughts of her\r\nown storm-broken and exhausted state to contemplate theirs. Not a bough\r\nin the nine trees which composed the group but was splintered, lopped,\r\nand distorted by the fierce weather that there held them at its mercy\r\nwhenever it prevailed. Some were blasted and split as if by lightning,\r\nblack stains as from fire marking their sides, while the ground at\r\ntheir feet was strewn with dead fir-needles and heaps of cones blown\r\ndown in the gales of past years. The place was called the Devil\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nBellows, and it was only necessary to come there on a March or November\r\nnight to discover the forcible reasons for that name. On the present\r\nheated afternoon, when no perceptible wind was blowing, the trees kept\r\nup a perpetual moan which one could hardly believe to be caused by the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nHere she sat for twenty minutes or more ere she could summon resolution\r\nto go down to the door, her courage being lowered to zero by her\r\nphysical lassitude. To any other person than a mother it might have\r\nseemed a little humiliating that she, the elder of the two women,\r\nshould be the first to make advances. But Mrs. Yeobright had well\r\nconsidered all that, and she only thought how best to make her visit\r\nappear to Eustacia not abject but wise.\r\n\r\nFrom her elevated position the exhausted woman could perceive the roof\r\nof the house below, and the garden and the whole enclosure of the\r\nlittle domicile. And now, at the moment of rising, she saw a second man\r\napproaching the gate. His manner was peculiar, hesitating, and not that\r\nof a person come on business or by invitation. He surveyed the house\r\nwith interest, and then walked round and scanned the outer boundary of\r\nthe garden, as one might have done had it been the birthplace of\r\nShakespeare, the prison of Mary Stuart, or the Ch\xc3\xa2teau of Hougomont.\r\nAfter passing round and again reaching the gate he went in. Mrs.\r\nYeobright was vexed at this, having reckoned on finding her son and his\r\nwife by themselves; but a moment\xe2\x80\x99s thought showed her that the presence\r\nof an acquaintance would take off the awkwardness of her first\r\nappearance in the house, by confining the talk to general matters until\r\nshe had begun to feel comfortable with them. She came down the hill to\r\nthe gate, and looked into the hot garden.\r\n\r\nThere lay the cat asleep on the bare gravel of the path, as if beds,\r\nrugs, and carpets were unendurable. The leaves of the hollyhocks hung\r\nlike half-closed umbrellas, the sap almost simmered in the stems, and\r\nfoliage with a smooth surface glared like metallic mirrors. A small\r\napple tree, of the sort called Ratheripe, grew just inside the gate,\r\nthe only one which throve in the garden, by reason of the lightness of\r\nthe soil; and among the fallen apples on the ground beneath were wasps\r\nrolling drunk with the juice, or creeping about the little caves in\r\neach fruit which they had eaten out before stupefied by its sweetness.\r\nBy the door lay Clym\xe2\x80\x99s furze-hook and the last handful of faggot-bonds\r\nshe had seen him gather; they had plainly been thrown down there as he\r\nentered the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\nA Conjuncture, and Its Result upon the Pedestrian\r\n\r\n\r\nWildeve, as has been stated, was determined to visit Eustacia boldly,\r\nby day, and on the easy terms of a relation, since the reddleman had\r\nspied out and spoilt his walks to her by night. The spell that she had\r\nthrown over him in the moonlight dance made it impossible for a man\r\nhaving no strong puritanic force within him to keep away altogether. He\r\nmerely calculated on meeting her and her husband in an ordinary manner,\r\nchatting a little while, and leaving again. Every outward sign was to\r\nbe conventional; but the one great fact would be there to satisfy\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94he would see her. He did not even desire Clym\xe2\x80\x99s absence, since it\r\nwas just possible that Eustacia might resent any situation which could\r\ncompromise her dignity as a wife, whatever the state of her heart\r\ntowards him. Women were often so.\r\n\r\nHe went accordingly; and it happened that the time of his arrival\r\ncoincided with that of Mrs. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s pause on the hill near the\r\nhouse. When he had looked round the premises in the manner she had\r\nnoticed he went and knocked at the door. There was a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99\r\ninterval, and then the key turned in the lock, the door opened, and\r\nEustacia herself confronted him.\r\n\r\nNobody could have imagined from her bearing now that here stood the\r\nwoman who had joined with him in the impassioned dance of the week\r\nbefore, unless indeed he could have penetrated below the surface and\r\ngauged the real depth of that still stream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you reached home safely?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes,\xe2\x80\x9d she carelessly returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd were you not tired the next day? I feared you might be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was rather. You need not speak low\xe2\x80\x94nobody will over-hear us. My\r\nsmall servant is gone on an errand to the village.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Clym is not at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! I thought that perhaps you had locked the door because you were\r\nalone and were afraid of tramps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94here is my husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had been standing in the entry. Closing the front door and turning\r\nthe key, as before, she threw open the door of the adjoining room and\r\nasked him to walk in. Wildeve entered, the room appearing to be empty;\r\nbut as soon as he had advanced a few steps he started. On the hearthrug\r\nlay Clym asleep. Beside him were the leggings, thick boots, leather\r\ngloves, and sleeve-waistcoat in which he worked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may go in; you will not disturb him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, following behind.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy reason for fastening the door is that he may not be intruded upon\r\nby any chance comer while lying here, if I should be in the garden or\r\nupstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is he sleeping there?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve in low tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is very weary. He went out at half-past four this morning, and has\r\nbeen working ever since. He cuts furze because it is the only thing he\r\ncan do that does not put any strain upon his poor eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d The contrast\r\nbetween the sleeper\xe2\x80\x99s appearance and Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s at this moment was\r\npainfully apparent to Eustacia, Wildeve being elegantly dressed in a\r\nnew summer suit and light hat; and she continued: \xe2\x80\x9cAh! you don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nhow differently he appeared when I first met him, though it is such a\r\nlittle while ago. His hands were as white and soft as mine; and look at\r\nthem now, how rough and brown they are! His complexion is by nature\r\nfair, and that rusty look he has now, all of a colour with his leather\r\nclothes, is caused by the burning of the sun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy does he go out at all!\xe2\x80\x9d Wildeve whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he hates to be idle; though what he earns doesn\xe2\x80\x99t add much to\r\nour exchequer. However, he says that when people are living upon their\r\ncapital they must keep down current expenses by turning a penny where\r\nthey can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fates have not been kind to you, Eustacia Yeobright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to thank them for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor has he\xe2\x80\x94except for their one great gift to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWildeve looked her in the eyes.\r\n\r\nEustacia blushed for the first time that day. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am a\r\nquestionable gift,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you meant the gift of\r\ncontent\xe2\x80\x94which he has, and I have not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can understand content in such a case\xe2\x80\x94though how the outward\r\nsituation can attract him puzzles me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s because you don\xe2\x80\x99t know him. He\xe2\x80\x99s an enthusiast about ideas, and\r\ncareless about outward things. He often reminds me of the Apostle\r\nPaul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to hear that he\xe2\x80\x99s so grand in character as that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but the worst of it is that though Paul was excellent as a man in\r\nthe Bible he would hardly have done in real life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir voices had instinctively dropped lower, though at first they had\r\ntaken no particular care to avoid awakening Clym. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if that means\r\nthat your marriage is a misfortune to you, you know who is to blame,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Wildeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe marriage is no misfortune in itself,\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted with some\r\nlittle petulance. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is simply the accident which has happened since\r\nthat has been the cause of my ruin. I have certainly got thistles for\r\nfigs in a worldly sense, but how could I tell what time would bring\r\nforth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes, Eustacia, I think it is a judgment upon you. You rightly\r\nbelonged to me, you know; and I had no idea of losing you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it was not my fault! Two could not belong to you; and remember\r\nthat, before I was aware, you turned aside to another woman. It was\r\ncruel levity in you to do that. I never dreamt of playing such a game\r\non my side till you began it on yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI meant nothing by it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Wildeve. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a mere interlude. Men\r\nare given to the trick of having a passing fancy for somebody else in\r\nthe midst of a permanent love, which reasserts itself afterwards just\r\nas before. On account of your rebellious manner to me I was tempted to\r\ngo further than I should have done; and when you still would keep\r\nplaying the same tantalizing part I went further still, and married\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d Turning and looking again at the unconscious form of Clym, he\r\nmurmured, \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid that you don\xe2\x80\x99t value your prize, Clym.... He\r\nought to be happier than I in one thing at least. He may know what it\r\nis to come down in the world, and to be afflicted with a great personal\r\ncalamity; but he probably doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is to lose the woman he\r\nloved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not ungrateful for winning her,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Eustacia, \xe2\x80\x9cand in\r\nthat respect he is a good man. Many women would go far for such a\r\nhusband. But do I desire unreasonably much in wanting what is called\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x94music, poetry, passion, war, and all the beating and pulsing that\r\nare going on in the great arteries of the world? That was the shape of\r\nmy youthful dream; but I did not get it. Yet I thought I saw the way to\r\nit in my Clym.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you only married him on that account?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you mistake me. I married him because I loved him, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t love him partly because I thought I saw a promise of\r\nthat life in him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have dropped into your old mournful key.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am not going to be depressed,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried perversely. \xe2\x80\x9cI began a\r\nnew system by going to that dance, and I mean to stick to it. Clym can\r\nsing merrily; why should not I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWildeve looked thoughtfully at her. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is easier to say you will sing\r\nthan to do it; though if I could I would encourage you in your attempt.\r\nBut as life means nothing to me, without one thing which is now\r\nimpossible, you will forgive me for not being able to encourage you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamon, what is the matter with you, that you speak like that?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked, raising her deep shady eyes to his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a thing I shall never tell plainly; and perhaps if I try to\r\ntell you in riddles you will not care to guess them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEustacia remained silent for a minute, and she said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are in a\r\nstrange relationship today. You mince matters to an uncommon nicety.\r\nYou mean, Damon, that you still love me. Well, that gives me sorrow,\r\nfor I am not made so entirely happy by my marriage that I am willing to\r\nspurn you for the information, as I ought to do. But we have said too\r\nmuch about this. Do you mean to wait until my husband is awake?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought to speak to him; but it is unnecessary, Eustacia, if I\r\noffend you by not forgetting you, you are right to mention it; but do\r\nnot talk of spurning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not reply, and they stood looking musingly at Clym as he slept\r\non in that profound sleep which is the result of physical labour\r\ncarried on in circumstances that wake no nervous fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod, how I envy him that sweet sleep!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not slept\r\nlike that since I was a boy\xe2\x80\x94years and years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile they thus watched him a click at the gate was audible, and a\r\nknock came to the door. Eustacia went to a window and looked out.\r\n\r\nHer countenance changed. First she became crimson, and then the red\r\nsubsided till it even partially left her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I go away?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve, standing up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Yeobright. O, what she said to me that day! I cannot understand\r\nthis visit\xe2\x80\x94what does she mean? And she suspects that past time of\r\nours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am in your hands. If you think she had better not see me here I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngo into the next room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes\xe2\x80\x94go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWildeve at once withdrew; but before he had been half a minute in the\r\nadjoining apartment Eustacia came after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe won\xe2\x80\x99t have any of this. If she comes in she must\r\nsee you\xe2\x80\x94and think if she likes there\xe2\x80\x99s something wrong! But how can I\r\nopen the door to her, when she dislikes me\xe2\x80\x94wishes to see not me, but\r\nher son? I won\xe2\x80\x99t open the door!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Yeobright knocked again more loudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer knocking will, in all likelihood, awaken him,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Eustacia,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand then he will let her in himself. Ah\xe2\x80\x94listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey could hear Clym moving in the other room, as if disturbed by the\r\nknocking, and he uttered the word \xe2\x80\x9cMother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94he is awake\xe2\x80\x94he will go to the door,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a breath of\r\nrelief. \xe2\x80\x9cCome this way. I have a bad name with her, and you must not be\r\nseen. Thus I am obliged to act by stealth, not because I do ill, but\r\nbecause others are pleased to say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time she had taken him to the back door, which was open,\r\ndisclosing a path leading down the garden. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, one word, Damon,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nremarked as he stepped forth. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is your first visit here; let it be\r\nyour last. We have been hot lovers in our time, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t do now.\r\nGood-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve. \xe2\x80\x9cI have had all I came for, and I am\r\nsatisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sight of you. Upon my eternal honour I came for no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWildeve kissed his hand to the beautiful girl he addressed, and passed\r\ninto the garden, where she watched him down the path, over the stile at\r\nthe end, and into the ferns outside, which brushed his hips as he went\r\nalong till he became lost in their thickets. When he had quite gone she\r\nslowly turned, and directed her attention to the interior of the house.\r\n\r\nBut it was possible that her presence might not be desired by Clym and\r\nhis mother at this moment of their first meeting, or that it would be\r\nsuperfluous. At all events, she was in no hurry to meet Mrs. Yeobright.\r\nShe resolved to wait till Clym came to look for her, and glided back\r\ninto the garden. Here she idly occupied herself for a few minutes, till\r\nfinding no notice was taken of her she retraced her steps through the\r\nhouse to the front, where she listened for voices in the parlour. But\r\nhearing none she opened the door and went in. To her astonishment Clym\r\nlay precisely as Wildeve and herself had left him, his sleep apparently\r\nunbroken. He had been disturbed and made to dream and murmur by the\r\nknocking, but he had not awakened. Eustacia hastened to the door, and\r\nin spite of her reluctance to open it to a woman who had spoken of her\r\nso bitterly, she unfastened it and looked out. Nobody was to be seen.\r\nThere, by the scraper, lay Clym\xe2\x80\x99s hook and the handful of faggot-bonds\r\nhe had brought home; in front of her were the empty path, the garden\r\ngate standing slightly ajar; and, beyond, the great valley of purple\r\nheath thrilling silently in the sun. Mrs. Yeobright was gone.\r\n\r\nClym\xe2\x80\x99s mother was at this time following a path which lay hidden from\r\nEustacia by a shoulder of the hill. Her walk thither from the garden\r\ngate had been hasty and determined, as of a woman who was now no less\r\nanxious to escape from the scene than she had previously been to enter\r\nit. Her eyes were fixed on the ground; within her two sights were\r\ngraven\xe2\x80\x94that of Clym\xe2\x80\x99s hook and brambles at the door, and that of a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s face at a window. Her lips trembled, becoming unnaturally thin\r\nas she murmured, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis too much\xe2\x80\x94Clym, how can he bear to do it! He is\r\nat home; and yet he lets her shut the door against me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn her anxiety to get out of the direct view of the house she had\r\ndiverged from the straightest path homeward, and while looking about to\r\nregain it she came upon a little boy gathering whortleberries in a\r\nhollow. The boy was Johnny Nunsuch, who had been Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s stoker at\r\nthe bonfire, and, with the tendency of a minute body to gravitate\r\ntowards a greater, he began hovering round Mrs. Yeobright as soon as\r\nshe appeared, and trotted on beside her without perceptible\r\nconsciousness of his act.\r\n\r\nMrs. Yeobright spoke to him as one in a mesmeric sleep. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a long\r\nway home, my child, and we shall not get there till evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall,\xe2\x80\x9d said her small companion. \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to play marnels afore\r\nsupper, and we go to supper at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, because Father comes home.\r\nDoes your father come home at six too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he never comes; nor my son either, nor anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have made you so down? Have you seen a ooser?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen what\xe2\x80\x99s worse\xe2\x80\x94a woman\xe2\x80\x99s face looking at me through a\r\nwindowpane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that a bad sight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. It is always a bad sight to see a woman looking out at a weary\r\nwayfarer and not letting her in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce when I went to Throope Great Pond to catch effets I seed myself\r\nlooking up at myself, and I was frightened and jumped back like\r\nanything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n...\xe2\x80\x9cIf they had only shown signs of meeting my advances halfway how\r\nwell it might have been done! But there is no chance. Shut out! She\r\nmust have set him against me. Can there be beautiful bodies without\r\nhearts inside? I think so. I would not have done it against a\r\nneighbour\xe2\x80\x99s cat on such a fiery day as this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever again\xe2\x80\x94never! Not even if they send for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be a very curious woman to talk like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no, not at all,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, returning to the boy\xe2\x80\x99s prattle. \xe2\x80\x9cMost\r\npeople who grow up and have children talk as I do. When you grow up\r\nyour mother will talk as I do too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope she won\xe2\x80\x99t; because \xe2\x80\x99tis very bad to talk nonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, child; it is nonsense, I suppose. Are you not nearly spent with\r\nthe heat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. But not so much as you be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour face is white and wet, and your head is hanging-down-like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I am exhausted from inside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you, every time you take a step, go like this?\xe2\x80\x9d The child in\r\nspeaking gave to his motion the jerk and limp of an invalid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I have a burden which is more than I can bear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little boy remained silently pondering, and they tottered on side\r\nby side until more than a quarter of an hour had elapsed, when Mrs.\r\nYeobright, whose weakness plainly increased, said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cI must sit\r\ndown here to rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she had seated herself he looked long in her face and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nfunny you draw your breath\xe2\x80\x94like a lamb when you drive him till he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnearly done for. Do you always draw your breath like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot always.\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice was now so low as to be scarcely above a\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will go to sleep there, I suppose, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? You have shut your\r\neyes already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I shall not sleep much till\xe2\x80\x94another day, and then I hope to have a\r\nlong, long one\xe2\x80\x94very long. Now can you tell me if Rimsmoor Pond is dry\r\nthis summer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRimsmoor Pond is, but Oker\xe2\x80\x99s Pool isn\xe2\x80\x99t, because he is deep, and is\r\nnever dry\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis just over there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the water clear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, middling\xe2\x80\x94except where the heath-croppers walk into it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, take this, and go as fast as you can, and dip me up the clearest\r\nyou can find. I am very faint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe drew from the small willow reticule that she carried in her hand an\r\nold-fashioned china teacup without a handle; it was one of half a dozen\r\nof the same sort lying in the reticule, which she had preserved ever\r\nsince her childhood, and had brought with her today as a small present\r\nfor Clym and Eustacia.\r\n\r\nThe boy started on his errand, and soon came back with the water, such\r\nas it was. Mrs. Yeobright attempted to drink, but it was so warm as to\r\ngive her nausea, and she threw it away. Afterwards she still remained\r\nsitting, with her eyes closed.\r\n\r\nThe boy waited, played near her, caught several of the little brown\r\nbutterflies which abounded, and then said as he waited again, \xe2\x80\x9cI like\r\ngoing on better than biding still. Will you soon start again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I might go on by myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, fearing, apparently, that\r\nhe was to be pressed into some unpleasant service. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want me any\r\nmore, please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Yeobright made no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I tell Mother?\xe2\x80\x9d the boy continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell her you have seen a broken-hearted woman cast off by her son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore quite leaving her he threw upon her face a wistful glance, as if\r\nhe had misgivings on the generosity of forsaking her thus. He gazed\r\ninto her face in a vague, wondering manner, like that of one examining\r\nsome strange old manuscript the key to whose characters is\r\nundiscoverable. He was not so young as to be absolutely without a sense\r\nthat sympathy was demanded, he was not old enough to be free from the\r\nterror felt in childhood at beholding misery in adult quarters hitherto\r\ndeemed impregnable; and whether she were in a position to cause trouble\r\nor to suffer from it, whether she and her affliction were something to\r\npity or something to fear, it was beyond him to decide. He lowered his\r\neyes and went on without another word. Before he had gone half a mile\r\nhe had forgotten all about her, except that she was a woman who had sat\r\ndown to rest.\r\n\r\nMrs. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s exertions, physical and emotional, had well-nigh\r\nprostrated her; but she continued to creep along in short stages with\r\nlong breaks between. The sun had now got far to the west of south and\r\nstood directly in her face, like some merciless incendiary, brand in\r\nhand, waiting to consume her. With the departure of the boy all visible\r\nanimation disappeared from the landscape, though the intermittent husky\r\nnotes of the male grasshoppers from every tuft of furze were enough to\r\nshow that amid the prostration of the larger animal species an unseen\r\ninsect world was busy in all the fullness of life.\r\n\r\nIn two hours she reached a slope about three-fourths the whole distance\r\nfrom Alderworth to her own home, where a little patch of\r\nshepherd\xe2\x80\x99s-thyme intruded upon the path; and she sat down upon the\r\nperfumed mat it formed there. In front of her a colony of ants had\r\nestablished a thoroughfare across the way, where they toiled a\r\nnever-ending and heavy-laden throng. To look down upon them was like\r\nobserving a city street from the top of a tower. She remembered that\r\nthis bustle of ants had been in progress for years at the same\r\nspot\xe2\x80\x94doubtless those of the old times were the ancestors of these which\r\nwalked there now. She leant back to obtain more thorough rest, and the\r\nsoft eastern portion of the sky was as great a relief to her eyes as\r\nthe thyme was to her head. While she looked a heron arose on that side\r\nof the sky and flew on with his face towards the sun. He had come\r\ndripping wet from some pool in the valleys, and as he flew the edges\r\nand lining of his wings, his thighs and his breast were so caught by\r\nthe bright sunbeams that he appeared as if formed of burnished silver.\r\nUp in the zenith where he was seemed a free and happy place, away from\r\nall contact with the earthly ball to which she was pinioned; and she\r\nwished that she could arise uncrushed from its surface and fly as he\r\nflew then.\r\n\r\nBut, being a mother, it was inevitable that she should soon cease to\r\nruminate upon her own condition. Had the track of her next thought been\r\nmarked by a streak in the air, like the path of a meteor, it would have\r\nshown a direction contrary to the heron\xe2\x80\x99s, and have descended to the\r\neastward upon the roof of Clym\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\nThe Tragic Meeting of Two Old Friends\r\n\r\n\r\nHe in the meantime had aroused himself from sleep, sat up, and looked\r\naround. Eustacia was sitting in a chair hard by him, and though she\r\nheld a book in her hand she had not looked into it for some time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym, brushing his eyes with his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nsoundly I have slept! I have had such a tremendous dream, too\xe2\x80\x94one I\r\nshall never forget.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you had been dreaming,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. It was about my mother. I dreamt that I took you to her house to\r\nmake up differences, and when we got there we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get in, though\r\nshe kept on crying to us for help. However, dreams are dreams. What\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock is it, Eustacia?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf-past two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo late, is it? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to stay so long. By the time I have had\r\nsomething to eat it will be after three.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnn is not come back from the village, and I thought I would let you\r\nsleep on till she returned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClym went to the window and looked out. Presently he said, musingly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeek after week passes, and yet Mother does not come. I thought I\r\nshould have heard something from her long before this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMisgiving, regret, fear, resolution, ran their swift course of\r\nexpression in Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s dark eyes. She was face to face with a\r\nmonstrous difficulty, and she resolved to get free of it by\r\npostponement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must certainly go to Blooms-End soon,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cand I think I\r\nhad better go alone.\xe2\x80\x9d He picked up his leggings and gloves, threw them\r\ndown again, and added, \xe2\x80\x9cAs dinner will be so late today I will not go\r\nback to the heath, but work in the garden till the evening, and then,\r\nwhen it will be cooler, I will walk to Blooms-End. I am quite sure that\r\nif I make a little advance Mother will be willing to forget all. It\r\nwill be rather late before I can get home, as I shall not be able to do\r\nthe distance either way in less than an hour and a half. But you will\r\nnot mind for one evening, dear? What are you thinking of to make you\r\nlook so abstracted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said heavily. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish we didn\xe2\x80\x99t live here,\r\nClym. The world seems all wrong in this place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94if we make it so. I wonder if Thomasin has been to Blooms-End\r\nlately. I hope so. But probably not, as she is, I believe, expecting to\r\nbe confined in a month or so. I wish I had thought of that before. Poor\r\nMother must indeed be very lonely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like you going tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething may be said which will terribly injure me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother is not vindictive,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym, his colour faintly rising.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I wish you would not go,\xe2\x80\x9d Eustacia repeated in a low tone. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\r\nagree not to go tonight I promise to go by myself to her house\r\ntomorrow, and make it up with her, and wait till you fetch me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you want to do that at this particular time, when at every\r\nprevious time that I have proposed it you have refused?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot explain further than that I should like to see her alone\r\nbefore you go,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, with an impatient move of her head, and\r\nlooking at him with an anxiety more frequently seen upon those of a\r\nsanguine temperament than upon such as herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is very odd that just when I had decided to go myself you\r\nshould want to do what I proposed long ago. If I wait for you to go\r\ntomorrow another day will be lost; and I know I shall be unable to rest\r\nanother night without having been. I want to get this settled, and\r\nwill. You must visit her afterwards\xe2\x80\x94it will be all the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could even go with you now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou could scarcely walk there and back without a longer rest than I\r\nshall take. No, not tonight, Eustacia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it be as you say, then,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied in the quiet way of one who,\r\nthough willing to ward off evil consequences by a mild effort, would\r\nlet events fall out as they might sooner than wrestle hard to direct\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nClym then went into the garden; and a thoughtful languor stole over\r\nEustacia for the remainder of the afternoon, which her husband\r\nattributed to the heat of the weather.\r\n\r\nIn the evening he set out on the journey. Although the heat of summer\r\nwas yet intense the days had considerably shortened, and before he had\r\nadvanced a mile on his way all the heath purples, browns, and greens\r\nhad merged in a uniform dress without airiness or graduation, and\r\nbroken only by touches of white where the little heaps of clean quartz\r\nsand showed the entrance to a rabbit burrow, or where the white flints\r\nof a footpath lay like a thread over the slopes. In almost every one of\r\nthe isolated and stunted thorns which grew here and there a nighthawk\r\nrevealed his presence by whirring like the clack of a mill as long as\r\nhe could hold his breath, then stopping, flapping his wings, wheeling\r\nround the bush, alighting, and after a silent interval of listening\r\nbeginning to whirr again. At each brushing of Clym\xe2\x80\x99s feet white\r\nmillermoths flew into the air just high enough to catch upon their\r\ndusty wings the mellowed light from the west, which now shone across\r\nthe depressions and levels of the ground without falling thereon to\r\nlight them up.\r\n\r\nYeobright walked on amid this quiet scene with a hope that all would\r\nsoon be well. Three miles on he came to a spot where a soft perfume was\r\nwafted across his path, and he stood still for a moment to inhale the\r\nfamiliar scent. It was the place at which, four hours earlier, his\r\nmother had sat down exhausted on the knoll covered with\r\nshepherd\xe2\x80\x99s-thyme. While he stood a sound between a breathing and a moan\r\nsuddenly reached his ears.\r\n\r\nHe looked to where the sound came from; but nothing appeared there save\r\nthe verge of the hillock stretching against the sky in an unbroken\r\nline. He moved a few steps in that direction, and now he perceived a\r\nrecumbent figure almost close to his feet.\r\n\r\nAmong the different possibilities as to the person\xe2\x80\x99s individuality\r\nthere did not for a moment occur to Yeobright that it might be one of\r\nhis own family. Sometimes furze-cutters had been known to sleep out of\r\ndoors at these times, to save a long journey homeward and back again;\r\nbut Clym remembered the moan and looked closer, and saw that the form\r\nwas feminine; and a distress came over him like cold air from a cave.\r\nBut he was not absolutely certain that the woman was his mother till he\r\nstooped and beheld her face, pallid, and with closed eyes.\r\n\r\nHis breath went, as it were, out of his body and the cry of anguish\r\nwhich would have escaped him died upon his lips. During the momentary\r\ninterval that elapsed before he became conscious that something must be\r\ndone all sense of time and place left him, and it seemed as if he and\r\nhis mother were as when he was a child with her many years ago on this\r\nheath at hours similar to the present. Then he awoke to activity; and\r\nbending yet lower he found that she still breathed, and that her breath\r\nthough feeble was regular, except when disturbed by an occasional gasp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, what is it! Mother, are you very ill\xe2\x80\x94you are not dying?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried,\r\npressing his lips to her face. \xe2\x80\x9cI am your Clym. How did you come here?\r\nWhat does it all mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that moment the chasm in their lives which his love for Eustacia had\r\ncaused was not remembered by Yeobright, and to him the present joined\r\ncontinuously with that friendly past that had been their experience\r\nbefore the division.\r\n\r\nShe moved her lips, appeared to know him, but could not speak; and then\r\nClym strove to consider how best to move her, as it would be necessary\r\nto get her away from the spot before the dews were intense. He was\r\nable-bodied, and his mother was thin. He clasped his arms round her,\r\nlifted her a little, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cDoes that hurt you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, and he lifted her up; then, at a slow pace, went\r\nonward with his load. The air was now completely cool; but whenever he\r\npassed over a sandy patch of ground uncarpeted with vegetation there\r\nwas reflected from its surface into his face the heat which it had\r\nimbibed during the day. At the beginning of his undertaking he had\r\nthought but little of the distance which yet would have to be traversed\r\nbefore Blooms-End could be reached; but though he had slept that\r\nafternoon he soon began to feel the weight of his burden. Thus he\r\nproceeded, like \xc3\x86neas with his father; the bats circling round his\r\nhead, nightjars flapping their wings within a yard of his face, and not\r\na human being within call.\r\n\r\nWhile he was yet nearly a mile from the house his mother exhibited\r\nsigns of restlessness under the constraint of being borne along, as if\r\nhis arms were irksome to her. He lowered her upon his knees and looked\r\naround. The point they had now reached, though far from any road, was\r\nnot more than a mile from the Blooms-End cottages occupied by Fairway,\r\nSam, Humphrey, and the Cantles. Moreover, fifty yards off stood a hut,\r\nbuilt of clods and covered with thin turves, but now entirely disused.\r\nThe simple outline of the lonely shed was visible, and thither he\r\ndetermined to direct his steps. As soon as he arrived he laid her down\r\ncarefully by the entrance, and then ran and cut with his pocketknife an\r\narmful of the dryest fern. Spreading this within the shed, which was\r\nentirely open on one side, he placed his mother thereon; then he ran\r\nwith all his might towards the dwelling of Fairway.\r\n\r\nNearly a quarter of an hour had passed, disturbed only by the broken\r\nbreathing of the sufferer, when moving figures began to animate the\r\nline between heath and sky. In a few moments Clym arrived with Fairway,\r\nHumphrey, and Susan Nunsuch; Olly Dowden, who had chanced to be at\r\nFairway\xe2\x80\x99s, Christian and Grandfer Cantle following helter-skelter\r\nbehind. They had brought a lantern and matches, water, a pillow, and a\r\nfew other articles which had occurred to their minds in the hurry of\r\nthe moment. Sam had been despatched back again for brandy, and a boy\r\nbrought Fairway\xe2\x80\x99s pony, upon which he rode off to the nearest medical\r\nman, with directions to call at Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s on his way, and inform\r\nThomasin that her aunt was unwell.\r\n\r\nSam and the brandy soon arrived, and it was administered by the light\r\nof the lantern; after which she became sufficiently conscious to\r\nsignify by signs that something was wrong with her foot. Olly Dowden at\r\nlength understood her meaning, and examined the foot indicated. It was\r\nswollen and red. Even as they watched the red began to assume a more\r\nlivid colour, in the midst of which appeared a scarlet speck, smaller\r\nthan a pea, and it was found to consist of a drop of blood, which rose\r\nabove the smooth flesh of her ankle in a hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what it is,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sam. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has been stung by an adder!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym instantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember when I was a child seeing just\r\nsuch a bite. O, my poor mother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was my father who was bit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s only one way to\r\ncure it. You must rub the place with the fat of other adders, and the\r\nonly way to get that is by frying them. That\xe2\x80\x99s what they did for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis an old remedy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym distrustfully, \xe2\x80\x9cand I have doubts about\r\nit. But we can do nothing else till the doctor comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a sure cure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Olly Dowden, with emphasis. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve used it when\r\nI used to go out nursing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we must pray for daylight, to catch them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym gloomily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will see what I can do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.\r\n\r\nHe took a green hazel which he had used as a walking stick, split it at\r\nthe end, inserted a small pebble, and with the lantern in his hand went\r\nout into the heath. Clym had by this time lit a small fire, and\r\ndespatched Susan Nunsuch for a frying pan. Before she had returned Sam\r\ncame in with three adders, one briskly coiling and uncoiling in the\r\ncleft of the stick, and the other two hanging dead across it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have only been able to get one alive and fresh as he ought to be,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Sam. \xe2\x80\x9cThese limp ones are two I killed today at work; but as they\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t die till the sun goes down they can\xe2\x80\x99t be very stale meat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe live adder regarded the assembled group with a sinister look in its\r\nsmall black eye, and the beautiful brown and jet pattern on its back\r\nseemed to intensify with indignation. Mrs. Yeobright saw the creature,\r\nand the creature saw her\xe2\x80\x94she quivered throughout, and averted her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at that,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Christian Cantle. \xe2\x80\x9cNeighbours, how do we know\r\nbut that something of the old serpent in God\xe2\x80\x99s garden, that gied the\r\napple to the young woman with no clothes, lives on in adders and snakes\r\nstill? Look at his eye\xe2\x80\x94for all the world like a villainous sort of\r\nblack currant. \xe2\x80\x99Tis to be hoped he can\xe2\x80\x99t ill-wish us! There\xe2\x80\x99s folks in\r\nheath who\xe2\x80\x99ve been overlooked already. I will never kill another adder\r\nas long as I live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, \xe2\x80\x99tis right to be afeard of things, if folks can\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGrandfer Cantle. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twould have saved me many a brave danger in my\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancy I heard something outside the shed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christian. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish\r\ntroubles would come in the daytime, for then a man could show his\r\ncourage, and hardly beg for mercy of the most broomstick old woman he\r\nshould see, if he was a brave man, and able to run out of her sight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven such an ignorant fellow as I should know better than do that,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there\xe2\x80\x99s calamities where we least expect it, whether or no.\r\nNeighbours, if Mrs. Yeobright were to die, d\xe2\x80\x99ye think we should be took\r\nup and tried for the manslaughter of a woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring it in as that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, \xe2\x80\x9cunless they could\r\nprove we had been poachers at some time of our lives. But she\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch\r\nround.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, if I had been stung by ten adders I should hardly have lost a\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s work for\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grandfer Cantle. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch is my spirit when I am\r\non my mettle. But perhaps \xe2\x80\x99tis natural in a man trained for war. Yes,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through a good deal; but nothing ever came amiss to me after\r\nI joined the Locals in four.\xe2\x80\x9d He shook his head and smiled at a mental\r\npicture of himself in uniform. \xe2\x80\x9cI was always first in the most\r\ngalliantest scrapes in my younger days!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose that was because they always used to put the biggest fool\r\nafore,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway from the fire, beside which he knelt, blowing it\r\nwith his breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99ye think so, Timothy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Grandfer Cantle, coming forward to\r\nFairway\xe2\x80\x99s side with sudden depression in his face. \xe2\x80\x9cThen a man may feel\r\nfor years that he is good solid company, and be wrong about himself\r\nafter all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind that question, Grandfer. Stir your stumps and get some more\r\nsticks. \xe2\x80\x99Tis very nonsense of an old man to prattle so when life and\r\ndeath\xe2\x80\x99s in mangling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grandfer Cantle, with melancholy conviction. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nthis is a bad night altogether for them that have done well in their\r\ntime; and if I were ever such a dab at the hautboy or tenor viol, I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have the heart to play tunes upon \xe2\x80\x99em now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan now arrived with the frying pan, when the live adder was killed\r\nand the heads of the three taken off. The remainders, being cut into\r\nlengths and split open, were tossed into the pan, which began hissing\r\nand crackling over the fire. Soon a rill of clear oil trickled from the\r\ncarcases, whereupon Clym dipped the corner of his handkerchief into the\r\nliquid and anointed the wound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\nEustacia Hears of Good Fortune, and Beholds Evil\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Eustacia, left alone in her cottage at Alderworth, had\r\nbecome considerably depressed by the posture of affairs. The\r\nconsequences which might result from Clym\xe2\x80\x99s discovery that his mother\r\nhad been turned from his door that day were likely to be disagreeable,\r\nand this was a quality in events which she hated as much as the\r\ndreadful.\r\n\r\nTo be left to pass the evening by herself was irksome to her at any\r\ntime, and this evening it was more irksome than usual by reason of the\r\nexcitements of the past hours. The two visits had stirred her into\r\nrestlessness. She was not wrought to any great pitch of uneasiness by\r\nthe probability of appearing in an ill light in the discussion between\r\nClym and his mother, but she was wrought to vexation, and her\r\nslumbering activities were quickened to the extent of wishing that she\r\nhad opened the door. She had certainly believed that Clym was awake,\r\nand the excuse would be an honest one as far as it went; but nothing\r\ncould save her from censure in refusing to answer at the first knock.\r\nYet, instead of blaming herself for the issue she laid the fault upon\r\nthe shoulders of some indistinct, colossal Prince of the World, who had\r\nframed her situation and ruled her lot.\r\n\r\nAt this time of the year it was pleasanter to walk by night than by\r\nday, and when Clym had been absent about an hour she suddenly resolved\r\nto go out in the direction of Blooms-End, on the chance of meeting him\r\non his return. When she reached the garden gate she heard wheels\r\napproaching, and looking round beheld her grandfather coming up in his\r\ncar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t stay a minute, thank ye,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered to her greeting. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\ndriving to East Egdon; but I came round here just to tell you the news.\r\nPerhaps you have heard\xe2\x80\x94about Mr. Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s fortune?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia blankly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he has come into a fortune of eleven thousand pounds\xe2\x80\x94uncle died\r\nin Canada, just after hearing that all his family, whom he was sending\r\nhome, had gone to the bottom in the Cassiopeia; so Wildeve has come\r\ninto everything, without in the least expecting it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEustacia stood motionless awhile. \xe2\x80\x9cHow long has he known of this?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it was known to him this morning early, for I knew it at ten\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, when Charley came back. Now, he is what I call a lucky man.\r\nWhat a fool you were, Eustacia!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what way?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, lifting her eyes in apparent calmness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, in not sticking to him when you had him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad him, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not know there had ever been anything between you till lately;\r\nand, faith, I should have been hot and strong against it if I had\r\nknown; but since it seems that there was some sniffing between ye, why\r\nthe deuce didn\xe2\x80\x99t you stick to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEustacia made no reply, but she looked as if she could say as much upon\r\nthat subject as he if she chose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how is your poor purblind husband?\xe2\x80\x9d continued the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cNot a\r\nbad fellow either, as far as he goes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is quite well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a good thing for his cousin what-d\xe2\x80\x99ye-call-her? By George, you\r\nought to have been in that galley, my girl! Now I must drive on. Do you\r\nwant any assistance? What\xe2\x80\x99s mine is yours, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Grandfather, we are not in want at present,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\ncoldly. \xe2\x80\x9cClym cuts furze, but he does it mostly as a useful pastime,\r\nbecause he can do nothing else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is paid for his pastime, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he? Three shillings a hundred, I\r\nheard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClym has money,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, colouring, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he likes to earn a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; good night.\xe2\x80\x9d And the captain drove on.\r\n\r\nWhen her grandfather was gone Eustacia went on her way mechanically;\r\nbut her thoughts were no longer concerning her mother-in-law and Clym.\r\nWildeve, notwithstanding his complaints against his fate, had been\r\nseized upon by destiny and placed in the sunshine once more. Eleven\r\nthousand pounds! From every Egdon point of view he was a rich man. In\r\nEustacia\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, too, it was an ample sum\xe2\x80\x94one sufficient to supply\r\nthose wants of hers which had been stigmatized by Clym in his more\r\naustere moods as vain and luxurious. Though she was no lover of money\r\nshe loved what money could bring; and the new accessories she imagined\r\naround him clothed Wildeve with a great deal of interest. She\r\nrecollected now how quietly well-dressed he had been that morning\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nhad probably put on his newest suit, regardless of damage by briars and\r\nthorns. And then she thought of his manner towards herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO I see it, I see it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much he wishes he had me now,\r\nthat he might give me all I desire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn recalling the details of his glances and words\xe2\x80\x94at the time scarcely\r\nregarded\xe2\x80\x94it became plain to her how greatly they had been dictated by\r\nhis knowledge of this new event. \xe2\x80\x9cHad he been a man to bear a jilt\r\nill-will he would have told me of his good fortune in crowing tones;\r\ninstead of doing that he mentioned not a word, in deference to my\r\nmisfortunes, and merely implied that he loved me still, as one superior\r\nto him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWildeve\xe2\x80\x99s silence that day on what had happened to him was just the\r\nkind of behaviour calculated to make an impression on such a woman.\r\nThose delicate touches of good taste were, in fact, one of the strong\r\npoints in his demeanour towards the other sex. The peculiarity of\r\nWildeve was that, while at one time passionate, upbraiding, and\r\nresentful towards a woman, at another he would treat her with such\r\nunparalleled grace as to make previous neglect appear as no\r\ndiscourtesy, injury as no insult, interference as a delicate attention,\r\nand the ruin of her honour as excess of chivalry. This man, whose\r\nadmiration today Eustacia had disregarded, whose good wishes she had\r\nscarcely taken the trouble to accept, whom she had shown out of the\r\nhouse by the back door, was the possessor of eleven thousand pounds\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nman of fair professional education, and one who had served his articles\r\nwith a civil engineer.\r\n\r\nSo intent was Eustacia upon Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s fortunes that she forgot how much\r\ncloser to her own course were those of Clym; and instead of walking on\r\nto meet him at once she sat down upon a stone. She was disturbed in her\r\nreverie by a voice behind, and turning her head beheld the old lover\r\nand fortunate inheritor of wealth immediately beside her.\r\n\r\nShe remained sitting, though the fluctuation in her look might have\r\ntold any man who knew her so well as Wildeve that she was thinking of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you come here?\xe2\x80\x9d she said in her clear low tone. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you\r\nwere at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went on to the village after leaving your garden; and now I have\r\ncome back again\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Which way are you walking, may I ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waved her hand in the direction of Blooms-End. \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to meet\r\nmy husband. I think I may possibly have got into trouble whilst you\r\nwere with me today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could that be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy not letting in Mrs. Yeobright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope that visit of mine did you no harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone. It was not your fault,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly.\r\n\r\nBy this time she had risen; and they involuntarily sauntered on\r\ntogether, without speaking, for two or three minutes; when Eustacia\r\nbroke silence by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI assume I must congratulate you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn what? O yes; on my eleven thousand pounds, you mean. Well, since I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t get something else, I must be content with getting that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem very indifferent about it. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me today when\r\nyou came?\xe2\x80\x9d she said in the tone of a neglected person. \xe2\x80\x9cI heard of it\r\nquite by accident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did mean to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x94well, I will speak\r\nfrankly\xe2\x80\x94I did not like to mention it when I saw, Eustacia, that your\r\nstar was not high. The sight of a man lying wearied out with hard work,\r\nas your husband lay, made me feel that to brag of my own fortune to you\r\nwould be greatly out of place. Yet, as you stood there beside him, I\r\ncould not help feeling too that in many respects he was a richer man\r\nthan I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this Eustacia said, with slumbering mischievousness, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, would\r\nyou exchange with him\xe2\x80\x94your fortune for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly would,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs we are imagining what is impossible and absurd, suppose we change\r\nthe subject?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; and I will tell you of my plans for the future, if you care\r\nto hear them. I shall permanently invest nine thousand pounds, keep one\r\nthousand as ready money, and with the remaining thousand travel for a\r\nyear or so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTravel? What a bright idea! Where will you go to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom here to Paris, where I shall pass the winter and spring. Then I\r\nshall go to Italy, Greece, Egypt, and Palestine, before the hot weather\r\ncomes on. In the summer I shall go to America; and then, by a plan not\r\nyet settled, I shall go to Australia and round to India. By that time I\r\nshall have begun to have had enough of it. Then I shall probably come\r\nback to Paris again, and there I shall stay as long as I can afford\r\nto.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBack to Paris again,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured in a voice that was nearly a sigh.\r\nShe had never once told Wildeve of the Parisian desires which Clym\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndescription had sown in her; yet here was he involuntarily in a\r\nposition to gratify them. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think a good deal of Paris?\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. In my opinion it is the central beauty-spot of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in mine! And Thomasin will go with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if she cares to. She may prefer to stay at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you will be going about, and I shall be staying here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you will. But we know whose fault that is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not blaming you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I thought you were. If ever you _should_ be inclined to blame me,\r\nthink of a certain evening by Rainbarrow, when you promised to meet me\r\nand did not. You sent me a letter; and my heart ached to read that as I\r\nhope yours never will. That was one point of divergence. I then did\r\nsomething in haste.... But she is a good woman, and I will say no\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that the blame was on my side that time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nit had not always been so. However, it is my misfortune to be too\r\nsudden in feeling. O, Damon, don\xe2\x80\x99t reproach me any more\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went on silently for a distance of two or three miles, when\r\nEustacia said suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you come out of your way, Mr.\r\nWildeve?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy way is anywhere tonight. I will go with you as far as the hill on\r\nwhich we can see Blooms-End, as it is getting late for you to be\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t trouble. I am not obliged to be out at all. I think I would\r\nrather you did not accompany me further. This sort of thing would have\r\nan odd look if known.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, I will leave you.\xe2\x80\x9d He took her hand unexpectedly, and\r\nkissed it\xe2\x80\x94for the first time since her marriage. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat light is that on\r\nthe hill?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, as it were to hide the caress.\r\n\r\nShe looked, and saw a flickering firelight proceeding from the open\r\nside of a hovel a little way before them. The hovel, which she had\r\nhitherto always found empty, seemed to be inhabited now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince you have come so far,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you see me safely\r\npast that hut? I thought I should have met Clym somewhere about here,\r\nbut as he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear I will hasten on and get to Blooms-End before\r\nhe leaves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey advanced to the turf-shed, and when they got near it the firelight\r\nand the lantern inside showed distinctly enough the form of a woman\r\nreclining on a bed of fern, a group of heath men and women standing\r\naround her. Eustacia did not recognize Mrs. Yeobright in the reclining\r\nfigure, nor Clym as one of the standers-by till she came close. Then\r\nshe quickly pressed her hand up on Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s arm and signified to him\r\nto come back from the open side of the shed into the shadow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my husband and his mother,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered in an agitated voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can it mean? Will you step forward and tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWildeve left her side and went to the back wall of the hut. Presently\r\nEustacia perceived that he was beckoning to her, and she advanced and\r\njoined him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a serious case,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve.\r\n\r\nFrom their position they could hear what was proceeding inside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot think where she could have been going,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym to someone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had evidently walked a long way, but even when she was able to\r\nspeak just now she would not tell me where. What do you really think of\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a great deal to fear,\xe2\x80\x9d was gravely answered, in a voice which\r\nEustacia recognized as that of the only surgeon in the district. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nhas suffered somewhat from the bite of the adder; but it is exhaustion\r\nwhich has overpowered her. My impression is that her walk must have\r\nbeen exceptionally long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI used to tell her not to overwalk herself this weather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym,\r\nwith distress. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think we did well in using the adder\xe2\x80\x99s fat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is a very ancient remedy\xe2\x80\x94the old remedy of the\r\nviper-catchers, I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is mentioned as an\r\ninfallible ointment by Hoffman, Mead, and I think the Abb\xc3\xa9 Fontana.\r\nUndoubtedly it was as good a thing as you could do; though I question\r\nif some other oils would not have been equally efficacious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, come here!\xe2\x80\x9d was then rapidly said in anxious female tones,\r\nand Clym and the doctor could be heard rushing forward from the back\r\npart of the shed to where Mrs. Yeobright lay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Eustacia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas Thomasin who spoke,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve. \xe2\x80\x9cThen they have fetched her.\r\nI wonder if I had better go in\xe2\x80\x94yet it might do harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a long time there was utter silence among the group within; and it\r\nwas broken at last by Clym saying, in an agonized voice, \xe2\x80\x9cO Doctor,\r\nwhat does it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor did not reply at once; ultimately he said, \xe2\x80\x9cShe is sinking\r\nfast. Her heart was previously affected, and physical exhaustion has\r\ndealt the finishing blow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen there was a weeping of women, then waiting, then hushed\r\nexclamations, then a strange gasping sound, then a painful stillness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all over,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor.\r\n\r\nFurther back in the hut the cotters whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Yeobright is\r\ndead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same moment the two watchers observed the form of a small\r\nold-fashioned child entering at the open side of the shed. Susan\r\nNunsuch, whose boy it was, went forward to the opening and silently\r\nbeckoned to him to go back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got something to tell \xe2\x80\x99ee, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried in a shrill tone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat woman asleep there walked along with me today; and she said I was\r\nto say that I had seed her, and she was a broken-hearted woman and cast\r\noff by her son, and then I came on home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA confused sob as from a man was heard within, upon which Eustacia\r\ngasped faintly, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Clym\xe2\x80\x94I must go to him\xe2\x80\x94yet dare I do it? No\xe2\x80\x94come\r\naway!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they had withdrawn from the neighbourhood of the shed she said\r\nhuskily, \xe2\x80\x9cI am to blame for this. There is evil in store for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas she not admitted to your house after all?\xe2\x80\x9d Wildeve inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, and that\xe2\x80\x99s where it all lies! Oh, what shall I do! I shall not\r\nintrude upon them\xe2\x80\x94I shall go straight home. Damon, good-bye! I cannot\r\nspeak to you any more now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey parted company; and when Eustacia had reached the next hill she\r\nlooked back. A melancholy procession was wending its way by the light\r\nof the lantern from the hut towards Blooms-End. Wildeve was nowhere to\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK FIFTH\xe2\x80\x94THE DISCOVERY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWherefore Is Light Given to Him That Is in Misery\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nOne evening, about three weeks after the funeral of Mrs. Yeobright,\r\nwhen the silver face of the moon sent a bundle of beams directly upon\r\nthe floor of Clym\xe2\x80\x99s house at Alderworth, a woman came forth from\r\nwithin. She reclined over the garden gate as if to refresh herself\r\nawhile. The pale lunar touches which make beauties of hags lent\r\ndivinity to this face, already beautiful.\r\n\r\nShe had not long been there when a man came up the road and with some\r\nhesitation said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cHow is he tonight, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, if you please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is better, though still very unwell, Humphrey,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Eustacia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he light-headed, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. He is quite sensible now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo he rave about his mother just the same, poor fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nHumphrey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as much, though not quite so wildly,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was very unfortunate, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, that the boy Johnny should ever ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntold him his mother\xe2\x80\x99s dying words, about her being broken-hearted and\r\ncast off by her son. \xe2\x80\x99Twas enough to upset any man alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEustacia made no reply beyond that of a slight catch in her breath, as\r\nof one who fain would speak but could not; and Humphrey, declining her\r\ninvitation to come in, went away.\r\n\r\nEustacia turned, entered the house, and ascended to the front bedroom,\r\nwhere a shaded light was burning. In the bed lay Clym, pale, haggard,\r\nwide awake, tossing to one side and to the other, his eyes lit by a hot\r\nlight, as if the fire in their pupils were burning up their substance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it you, Eustacia?\xe2\x80\x9d he said as she sat down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Clym. I have been down to the gate. The moon is shining\r\nbeautifully, and there is not a leaf stirring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShining, is it? What\xe2\x80\x99s the moon to a man like me? Let it shine\xe2\x80\x94let\r\nanything be, so that I never see another day!... Eustacia, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhere to look\xe2\x80\x94my thoughts go through me like swords. O, if any man\r\nwants to make himself immortal by painting a picture of wretchedness,\r\nlet him come here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you say so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot help feeling that I did my best to kill her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Clym.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it was so; it is useless to excuse me! My conduct to her was too\r\nhideous\xe2\x80\x94I made no advances; and she could not bring herself to forgive\r\nme. Now she is dead! If I had only shown myself willing to make it up\r\nwith her sooner, and we had been friends, and then she had died, it\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so hard to bear. But I never went near her house, so she\r\nnever came near mine, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how welcome she would have\r\nbeen\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what troubles me. She did not know I was going to her house\r\nthat very night, for she was too insensible to understand me. If she\r\nhad only come to see me! I longed that she would. But it was not to\r\nbe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere escaped from Eustacia one of those shivering sighs which used to\r\nshake her like a pestilent blast. She had not yet told.\r\n\r\nBut Yeobright was too deeply absorbed in the ramblings incidental to\r\nhis remorseful state to notice her. During his illness he had been\r\ncontinually talking thus. Despair had been added to his original grief\r\nby the unfortunate disclosure of the boy who had received the last\r\nwords of Mrs. Yeobright\xe2\x80\x94words too bitterly uttered in an hour of\r\nmisapprehension. Then his distress had overwhelmed him, and he longed\r\nfor death as a field labourer longs for the shade. It was the pitiful\r\nsight of a man standing in the very focus of sorrow. He continually\r\nbewailed his tardy journey to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s house, because it was an\r\nerror which could never be rectified, and insisted that he must have\r\nbeen horribly perverted by some fiend not to have thought before that\r\nit was his duty to go to her, since she did not come to him. He would\r\nask Eustacia to agree with him in his self-condemnation; and when she,\r\nseared inwardly by a secret she dared not tell, declared that she could\r\nnot give an opinion, he would say, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s because you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s nature. She was always ready to forgive if asked to do so; but\r\nI seemed to her to be as an obstinate child, and that made her\r\nunyielding. Yet not unyielding\xe2\x80\x94she was proud and reserved, no more....\r\nYes, I can understand why she held out against me so long. She was\r\nwaiting for me. I dare say she said a hundred times in her sorrow,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a return he makes for all the sacrifices I have made for him!\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nnever went to her! When I set out to visit her it was too late. To\r\nthink of that is nearly intolerable!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSometimes his condition had been one of utter remorse, unsoftened by a\r\nsingle tear of pure sorrow: and then he writhed as he lay, fevered far\r\nmore by thought than by physical ills. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I could only get one\r\nassurance that she did not die in a belief that I was resentful,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid one day when in this mood, \xe2\x80\x9cit would be better to think of than a\r\nhope of heaven. But that I cannot do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou give yourself up too much to this wearying despair,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEustacia. \xe2\x80\x9cOther men\xe2\x80\x99s mothers have died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make the loss of mine less. Yet it is less the loss than\r\nthe circumstances of the loss. I sinned against her, and on that\r\naccount there is no light for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe sinned against you, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, she did not. I committed the guilt; and may the whole burden be\r\nupon my head!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you might consider twice before you say that,\xe2\x80\x9d Eustacia\r\nreplied. \xe2\x80\x9cSingle men have, no doubt, a right to curse themselves as\r\nmuch as they please; but men with wives involve two in the doom they\r\npray down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am in too sorry a state to understand what you are refining on,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the wretched man. \xe2\x80\x9cDay and night shout at me, \xe2\x80\x98You have helped to\r\nkill her.\xe2\x80\x99 But in loathing myself I may, I own, be unjust to you, my\r\npoor wife. Forgive me for it, Eustacia, for I scarcely know what I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEustacia was always anxious to avoid the sight of her husband in such a\r\nstate as this, which had become as dreadful to her as the trial scene\r\nwas to Judas Iscariot. It brought before her eyes the spectre of a\r\nworn-out woman knocking at a door which she would not open; and she\r\nshrank from contemplating it. Yet it was better for Yeobright himself\r\nwhen he spoke openly of his sharp regret, for in silence he endured\r\ninfinitely more, and would sometimes remain so long in a tense,\r\nbrooding mood, consuming himself by the gnawing of his thought, that it\r\nwas imperatively necessary to make him talk aloud, that his grief might\r\nin some degree expend itself in the effort.\r\n\r\nEustacia had not been long indoors after her look at the moonlight when\r\na soft footstep came up to the house, and Thomasin was announced by the\r\nwoman downstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Thomasin! Thank you for coming tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym when she\r\nentered the room. \xe2\x80\x9cHere am I, you see. Such a wretched spectacle am I,\r\nthat I shrink from being seen by a single friend, and almost from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not shrink from me, dear Clym,\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomasin earnestly, in\r\nthat sweet voice of hers which came to a sufferer like fresh air into a\r\nBlack Hole. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing in you can ever shock me or drive me away. I have\r\nbeen here before, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t remember it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do; I am not delirious, Thomasin, nor have I been so at all.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you believe that if they say so. I am only in great misery at\r\nwhat I have done, and that, with the weakness, makes me seem mad. But\r\nit has not upset my reason. Do you think I should remember all about my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s death if I were out of my mind? No such good luck. Two months\r\nand a half, Thomasin, the last of her life, did my poor mother live\r\nalone, distracted and mourning because of me; yet she was unvisited by\r\nme, though I was living only six miles off. Two months and a\r\nhalf\xe2\x80\x94seventy-five days did the sun rise and set upon her in that\r\ndeserted state which a dog didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve! Poor people who had nothing\r\nin common with her would have cared for her, and visited her had they\r\nknown her sickness and loneliness; but I, who should have been all to\r\nher, stayed away like a cur. If there is any justice in God let Him\r\nkill me now. He has nearly blinded me, but that is not enough. If He\r\nwould only strike me with more pain I would believe in Him forever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, hush! O, pray, Clym, don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t say it!\xe2\x80\x9d implored Thomasin,\r\naffrighted into sobs and tears; while Eustacia, at the other side of\r\nthe room, though her pale face remained calm, writhed in her chair.\r\nClym went on without heeding his cousin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am not worth receiving further proof even of Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreprobation. Do you think, Thomasin, that she knew me\xe2\x80\x94that she did not\r\ndie in that horrid mistaken notion about my not forgiving her, which I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t tell you how she acquired? If you could only assure me of that!\r\nDo you think so, Eustacia? Do speak to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I can assure you that she knew better at last,\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomasin.\r\nThe pallid Eustacia said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t she come to my house? I would have taken her in and showed\r\nher how I loved her in spite of all. But she never came; and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngo to her, and she died on the heath like an animal kicked out, nobody\r\nto help her till it was too late. If you could have seen her, Thomasin,\r\nas I saw her\xe2\x80\x94a poor dying woman, lying in the dark upon the bare\r\nground, moaning, nobody near, believing she was utterly deserted by all\r\nthe world, it would have moved you to anguish, it would have moved a\r\nbrute. And this poor woman my mother! No wonder she said to the child,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have seen a broken-hearted woman.\xe2\x80\x99 What a state she must have been\r\nbrought to, to say that! and who can have done it but I? It is too\r\ndreadful to think of, and I wish I could be punished more heavily than\r\nI am. How long was I what they called out of my senses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA week, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then I became calm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, for four days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now I have left off being calm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut try to be quiet\xe2\x80\x94please do, and you will soon be strong. If you\r\ncould remove that impression from your mind\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get strong.\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use of my getting well? It would be better for me if I die,\r\nand it would certainly be better for Eustacia. Is Eustacia there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be better for you, Eustacia, if I were to die?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t press such a question, dear Clym.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it really is but a shadowy supposition; for unfortunately I am\r\ngoing to live. I feel myself getting better. Thomasin, how long are you\r\ngoing to stay at the inn, now that all this money has come to your\r\nhusband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother month or two, probably; until my illness is over. We cannot\r\nget off till then. I think it will be a month or more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. Of course. Ah, Cousin Tamsie, you will get over your\r\ntrouble\xe2\x80\x94one little month will take you through it, and bring something\r\nto console you; but I shall never get over mine, and no consolation\r\nwill come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClym, you are unjust to yourself. Depend upon it, Aunt thought kindly\r\nof you. I know that, if she had lived, you would have been reconciled\r\nwith her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she didn\xe2\x80\x99t come to see me, though I asked her, before I married,\r\nif she would come. Had she come, or had I gone there, she would never\r\nhave died saying, \xe2\x80\x98I am a broken-hearted woman, cast off by my son.\xe2\x80\x99 My\r\ndoor has always been open to her\xe2\x80\x94a welcome here has always awaited her.\r\nBut that she never came to see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better not talk any more now, Clym,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia faintly\r\nfrom the other part of the room, for the scene was growing intolerable\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me talk to you instead for the little time I shall be here,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThomasin said soothingly. \xe2\x80\x9cConsider what a one-sided way you have of\r\nlooking at the matter, Clym. When she said that to the little boy you\r\nhad not found her and taken her into your arms; and it might have been\r\nuttered in a moment of bitterness. It was rather like Aunt to say\r\nthings in haste. She sometimes used to speak so to me. Though she did\r\nnot come I am convinced that she thought of coming to see you. Do you\r\nsuppose a man\xe2\x80\x99s mother could live two or three months without one\r\nforgiving thought? She forgave me; and why should she not have forgiven\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou laboured to win her round; I did nothing. I, who was going to\r\nteach people the higher secrets of happiness, did not know how to keep\r\nout of that gross misery which the most untaught are wise enough to\r\navoid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you get here tonight, Thomasin?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamon set me down at the end of the lane. He has driven into East\r\nEgdon on business, and he will come and pick me up by-and-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccordingly they soon after heard the noise of wheels. Wildeve had\r\ncome, and was waiting outside with his horse and gig.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend out and tell him I will be down in two minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomasin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will run down myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia.\r\n\r\nShe went down. Wildeve had alighted, and was standing before the\r\nhorse\xe2\x80\x99s head when Eustacia opened the door. He did not turn for a\r\nmoment, thinking the comer Thomasin. Then he looked, startled ever so\r\nlittle, and said one word: \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not yet told him,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen don\xe2\x80\x99t do so till he is well\xe2\x80\x94it will be fatal. You are ill\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am wretched.... O Damon,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, bursting into tears, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell you how unhappy I am! I can hardly bear this. I can tell nobody of\r\nmy trouble\xe2\x80\x94nobody knows of it but you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor girl!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve, visibly affected at her distress, and at\r\nlast led on so far as to take her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is hard, when you have done\r\nnothing to deserve it, that you should have got involved in such a web\r\nas this. You were not made for these sad scenes. I am to blame most. If\r\nI could only have saved you from it all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Damon, please pray tell me what I must do? To sit by him hour\r\nafter hour, and hear him reproach himself as being the cause of her\r\ndeath, and to know that I am the sinner, if any human being is at all,\r\ndrives me into cold despair. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do. Should I tell him\r\nor should I not tell him? I always am asking myself that. O, I want to\r\ntell him; and yet I am afraid. If he finds it out he must surely kill\r\nme, for nothing else will be in proportion to his feelings now. \xe2\x80\x98Beware\r\nthe fury of a patient man\xe2\x80\x99 sounds day by day in my ears as I watch\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, wait till he is better, and trust to chance. And when you tell,\r\nyou must only tell part\xe2\x80\x94for his own sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich part should I keep back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWildeve paused. \xe2\x80\x9cThat I was in the house at the time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a low\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; it must be concealed, seeing what has been whispered. How much\r\neasier are hasty actions than speeches that will excuse them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he were only to die\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Wildeve murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not think of it! I would not buy hope of immunity by so cowardly a\r\ndesire even if I hated him. Now I am going up to him again. Thomasin\r\nbade me tell you she would be down in a few minutes. Good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe returned, and Thomasin soon appeared. When she was seated in the\r\ngig with her husband, and the horse was turning to go off, Wildeve\r\nlifted his eyes to the bedroom windows. Looking from one of them he\r\ncould discern a pale, tragic face watching him drive away. It was\r\nEustacia\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\nA Lurid Light Breaks in upon a Darkened Understanding\r\n\r\n\r\nClym\xe2\x80\x99s grief became mitigated by wearing itself out. His strength\r\nreturned, and a month after the visit of Thomasin he might have been\r\nseen walking about the garden. Endurance and despair, equanimity and\r\ngloom, the tints of health and the pallor of death, mingled weirdly in\r\nhis face. He was now unnaturally silent upon all of the past that\r\nrelated to his mother; and though Eustacia knew that he was thinking of\r\nit none the less, she was only too glad to escape the topic ever to\r\nbring it up anew. When his mind had been weaker his heart had led him\r\nto speak out; but reason having now somewhat recovered itself he sank\r\ninto taciturnity.\r\n\r\nOne evening when he was thus standing in the garden, abstractedly\r\nspudding up a weed with his stick, a bony figure turned the corner of\r\nthe house and came up to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristian, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym. \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you have found me out. I\r\nshall soon want you to go to Blooms-End and assist me in putting the\r\nhouse in order. I suppose it is all locked up as I left it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mister Clym.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you dug up the potatoes and other roots?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, without a drop o\xe2\x80\x99 rain, thank God. But I was coming to tell \xe2\x80\x99ee\r\nof something else which is quite different from what we have lately had\r\nin the family. I am sent by the rich gentleman at the Woman, that we\r\nused to call the landlord, to tell \xe2\x80\x99ee that Mrs. Wildeve is doing well\r\nof a girl, which was born punctually at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock at noon, or a few\r\nminutes more or less; and \xe2\x80\x99tis said that expecting of this increase is\r\nwhat have kept \xe2\x80\x99em there since they came into their money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she is getting on well, you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir. Only Mr. Wildeve is twanky because \xe2\x80\x99tisn\xe2\x80\x99t a boy\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nthey say in the kitchen, but I was not supposed to notice that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristian, now listen to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sure, Mr. Yeobright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see my mother the day before she died?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I did not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYeobright\xe2\x80\x99s face expressed disappointment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I zeed her the morning of the same day she died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClym\xe2\x80\x99s look lighted up. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s nearer still to my meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know \xe2\x80\x99twas the same day; for she said, \xe2\x80\x98I be going to see him,\r\nChristian; so I shall not want any vegetables brought in for dinner.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee you. She was going to your house, you understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYeobright regarded Christian with intense surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you never\r\nmention this?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure it was my house she was coming\r\nto?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention it because I\xe2\x80\x99ve never zeed you lately. And as\r\nshe didn\xe2\x80\x99t get there it was all nought, and nothing to tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have been wondering why she should have walked in the heath on\r\nthat hot day! Well, did she say what she was coming for? It is a thing,\r\nChristian, I am very anxious to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mister Clym. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t say it to me, though I think she did to\r\none here and there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know one person to whom she spoke of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one man, please, sir, but I hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t mention my name to\r\nhim, as I have seen him in strange places, particular in dreams. One\r\nnight last summer he glared at me like Famine and Sword, and it made me\r\nfeel so low that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t comb out my few hairs for two days. He was\r\nstanding, as it might be, Mister Yeobright, in the middle of the path\r\nto Mistover, and your mother came up, looking as pale\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, when was that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLast summer, in my dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! Who\xe2\x80\x99s the man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiggory, the reddleman. He called upon her and sat with her the\r\nevening before she set out to see you. I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t gone home from work\r\nwhen he came up to the gate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must see Venn\xe2\x80\x94I wish I had known it before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym anxiously. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwonder why he has not come to tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe went out of Egdon Heath the next day, so would not be likely to\r\nknow you wanted him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristian,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must go and find Venn. I am otherwise\r\nengaged, or I would go myself. Find him at once, and tell him I want to\r\nspeak to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a good hand at hunting up folk by day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christian, looking\r\ndubiously round at the declining light; \xe2\x80\x9cbut as to night-time, never is\r\nsuch a bad hand as I, Mister Yeobright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSearch the heath when you will, so that you bring him soon. Bring him\r\ntomorrow, if you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristian then departed. The morrow came, but no Venn. In the evening\r\nChristian arrived, looking very weary. He had been searching all day,\r\nand had heard nothing of the reddleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInquire as much as you can tomorrow without neglecting your work,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Yeobright. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t come again till you have found him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next day Yeobright set out for the old house at Blooms-End, which,\r\nwith the garden, was now his own. His severe illness had hindered all\r\npreparations for his removal thither; but it had become necessary that\r\nhe should go and overlook its contents, as administrator to his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s little property; for which purpose he decided to pass the next\r\nnight on the premises.\r\n\r\nHe journeyed onward, not quickly or decisively, but in the slow walk of\r\none who has been awakened from a stupefying sleep. It was early\r\nafternoon when he reached the valley. The expression of the place, the\r\ntone of the hour, were precisely those of many such occasions in days\r\ngone by; and these antecedent similarities fostered the illusion that\r\nshe, who was there no longer, would come out to welcome him. The garden\r\ngate was locked and the shutters were closed, just as he himself had\r\nleft them on the evening after the funeral. He unlocked the gate, and\r\nfound that a spider had already constructed a large web, tying the door\r\nto the lintel, on the supposition that it was never to be opened again.\r\nWhen he had entered the house and flung back the shutters he set about\r\nhis task of overhauling the cupboards and closets, burning papers, and\r\nconsidering how best to arrange the place for Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s reception,\r\nuntil such time as he might be in a position to carry out his\r\nlong-delayed scheme, should that time ever arrive.\r\n\r\nAs he surveyed the rooms he felt strongly disinclined for the\r\nalterations which would have to be made in the time-honoured furnishing\r\nof his parents and grandparents, to suit Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s modern ideas. The\r\ngaunt oak-cased clock, with the picture of the Ascension on the door\r\npanel and the Miraculous Draught of Fishes on the base; his\r\ngrandmother\xe2\x80\x99s corner cupboard with the glass door, through which the\r\nspotted china was visible; the dumb-waiter; the wooden tea trays; the\r\nhanging fountain with the brass tap\xe2\x80\x94whither would these venerable\r\narticles have to be banished?\r\n\r\nHe noticed that the flowers in the window had died for want of water,\r\nand he placed them out upon the ledge, that they might be taken away.\r\nWhile thus engaged he heard footsteps on the gravel without, and\r\nsomebody knocked at the door.\r\n\r\nYeobright opened it, and Venn was standing before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reddleman. \xe2\x80\x9cIs Mrs. Yeobright at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYeobright looked upon the ground. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you have not seen Christian or\r\nany of the Egdon folks?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I have only just returned after a long stay away. I called here\r\nthe day before I left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have heard nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother is\xe2\x80\x94dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead!\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn mechanically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer home now is where I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind having mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVenn regarded him, and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see your face I could\r\nnever believe your words. Have you been ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had an illness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the change! When I parted from her a month ago everything seemed\r\nto say that she was going to begin a new life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what seemed came true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say right, no doubt. Trouble has taught you a deeper vein of talk\r\nthan mine. All I meant was regarding her life here. She has died too\r\nsoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps through my living too long. I have had a bitter experience on\r\nthat score this last month, Diggory. But come in; I have been wanting\r\nto see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe conducted the reddleman into the large room where the dancing had\r\ntaken place the previous Christmas, and they sat down in the settle\r\ntogether. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the cold fireplace, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen that\r\nhalf-burnt log and those cinders were alight she was alive! Little has\r\nbeen changed here yet. I can do nothing. My life creeps like a snail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow came she to die?\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn.\r\n\r\nYeobright gave him some particulars of her illness and death, and\r\ncontinued: \xe2\x80\x9cAfter this no kind of pain will ever seem more than an\r\nindisposition to me. I began saying that I wanted to ask you something,\r\nbut I stray from subjects like a drunken man. I am anxious to know what\r\nmy mother said to you when she last saw you. You talked with her a long\r\ntime, I think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI talked with her more than half an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. And it must have been on account of what we said that she was on\r\nthe heath. Without question she was coming to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why should she come to see me if she felt so bitterly against me?\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s the mystery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet I know she quite forgave \xe2\x80\x99ee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Diggory\xe2\x80\x94would a woman, who had quite forgiven her son, say, when\r\nshe felt herself ill on the way to his house, that she was\r\nbroken-hearted because of his ill-usage? Never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I know is that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t blame you at all. She blamed herself\r\nfor what had happened, and only herself. I had it from her own lips.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had it from her lips that I had _not_ ill-treated her; and at the\r\nsame time another had it from her lips that I _had_ ill-treated her? My\r\nmother was no impulsive woman who changed her opinion every hour\r\nwithout reason. How can it be, Venn, that she should have told such\r\ndifferent stories in close succession?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot say. It is certainly odd, when she had forgiven you, and had\r\nforgiven your wife, and was going to see ye on purpose to make\r\nfriends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there was one thing wanting to bewilder me it was this\r\nincomprehensible thing!... Diggory, if we, who remain alive, were only\r\nallowed to hold conversation with the dead\xe2\x80\x94just once, a bare minute,\r\neven through a screen of iron bars, as with persons in prison\xe2\x80\x94what we\r\nmight learn! How many who now ride smiling would hide their heads! And\r\nthis mystery\xe2\x80\x94I should then be at the bottom of it at once. But the\r\ngrave has forever shut her in; and how shall it be found out now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo reply was returned by his companion, since none could be given; and\r\nwhen Venn left, a few minutes later, Clym had passed from the dullness\r\nof sorrow to the fluctuation of carking incertitude.\r\n\r\nHe continued in the same state all the afternoon. A bed was made up for\r\nhim in the same house by a neighbour, that he might not have to return\r\nagain the next day; and when he retired to rest in the deserted place\r\nit was only to remain awake hour after hour thinking the same thoughts.\r\nHow to discover a solution to this riddle of death seemed a query of\r\nmore importance than highest problems of the living. There was housed\r\nin his memory a vivid picture of the face of a little boy as he entered\r\nthe hovel where Clym\xe2\x80\x99s mother lay. The round eyes, eager gaze, the\r\npiping voice which enunciated the words, had operated like stilettos on\r\nhis brain.\r\n\r\nA visit to the boy suggested itself as a means of gleaning new\r\nparticulars; though it might be quite unproductive. To probe a child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind after the lapse of six weeks, not for facts which the child had\r\nseen and understood, but to get at those which were in their nature\r\nbeyond him, did not promise much; yet when every obvious channel is\r\nblocked we grope towards the small and obscure. There was nothing else\r\nleft to do; after that he would allow the enigma to drop into the abyss\r\nof undiscoverable things.\r\n\r\nIt was about daybreak when he had reached this decision, and he at once\r\narose. He locked up the house and went out into the green patch which\r\nmerged in heather further on. In front of the white garden-palings the\r\npath branched into three like a broad arrow. The road to the right led\r\nto the Quiet Woman and its neighbourhood; the middle track led to\r\nMistover Knap; the left-hand track led over the hill to another part of\r\nMistover, where the child lived. On inclining into the latter path\r\nYeobright felt a creeping chilliness, familiar enough to most people,\r\nand probably caused by the unsunned morning air. In after days he\r\nthought of it as a thing of singular significance.\r\n\r\nWhen Yeobright reached the cottage of Susan Nunsuch, the mother of the\r\nboy he sought, he found that the inmates were not yet astir. But in\r\nupland hamlets the transition from a-bed to abroad is surprisingly\r\nswift and easy. There no dense partition of yawns and toilets divides\r\nhumanity by night from humanity by day. Yeobright tapped at the upper\r\nwindowsill, which he could reach with his walking stick; and in three\r\nor four minutes the woman came down.\r\n\r\nIt was not till this moment that Clym recollected her to be the person\r\nwho had behaved so barbarously to Eustacia. It partly explained the\r\ninsuavity with which the woman greeted him. Moreover, the boy had been\r\nailing again; and Susan now, as ever since the night when he had been\r\npressed into Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s service at the bonfire, attributed his\r\nindispositions to Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s influence as a witch. It was one of those\r\nsentiments which lurk like moles underneath the visible surface of\r\nmanners, and may have been kept alive by Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s entreaty to the\r\ncaptain, at the time that he had intended to prosecute Susan for the\r\npricking in church, to let the matter drop; which he accordingly had\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nYeobright overcame his repugnance, for Susan had at least borne his\r\nmother no ill-will. He asked kindly for the boy; but her manner did not\r\nimprove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to see him,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Yeobright, with some hesitation, \xe2\x80\x9cto ask\r\nhim if he remembers anything more of his walk with my mother than what\r\nhe has previously told.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe regarded him in a peculiar and criticizing manner. To anybody but a\r\nhalf-blind man it would have said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou want another of the knocks\r\nwhich have already laid you so low.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe called the boy downstairs, asked Clym to sit down on a stool, and\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Johnny, tell Mr. Yeobright anything you can call to\r\nmind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not forgotten how you walked with the poor lady on that hot\r\nday?\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what she said to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy repeated the exact words he had used on entering the hut.\r\nYeobright rested his elbow on the table and shaded his face with his\r\nhand; and the mother looked as if she wondered how a man could want\r\nmore of what had stung him so deeply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was going to Alderworth when you first met her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; she was coming away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat can\xe2\x80\x99t be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; she walked along with me. I was coming away, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen where did you first see her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt your house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAttend, and speak the truth!\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym sternly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; at your house was where I seed her first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClym started up, and Susan smiled in an expectant way which did not\r\nembellish her face; it seemed to mean, \xe2\x80\x9cSomething sinister is coming!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did she do at my house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe went and sat under the trees at the Devil\xe2\x80\x99s Bellows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God! this is all news to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never told me this before?\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mother; because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to tell \xe2\x80\x99ee I had been so far. I was\r\npicking blackhearts, and went further than I meant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did she do then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Yeobright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLooked at a man who came up and went into your house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was myself\xe2\x80\x94a furze-cutter, with brambles in his hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; \xe2\x80\x99twas not you. \xe2\x80\x99Twas a gentleman. You had gone in afore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow tell me what happened next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor lady went and knocked at your door, and the lady with black\r\nhair looked out of the side window at her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy\xe2\x80\x99s mother turned to Clym and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is something you didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexpect?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYeobright took no more notice of her than if he had been of stone. \xe2\x80\x9cGo\r\non, go on,\xe2\x80\x9d he said hoarsely to the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when she saw the young lady look out of the window the old lady\r\nknocked again; and when nobody came she took up the furze-hook and\r\nlooked at it, and put it down again, and then she looked at the\r\nfaggot-bonds; and then she went away, and walked across to me, and\r\nblowed her breath very hard, like this. We walked on together, she and\r\nI, and I talked to her and she talked to me a bit, but not much,\r\nbecause she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t blow her breath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Clym, in a low tone, and bowed his head. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s have\r\nmore,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk much, and she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t walk; and her face was, O so\r\nqueer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow was her face?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike yours is now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman looked at Yeobright, and beheld him colourless, in a cold\r\nsweat. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t there meaning in it?\xe2\x80\x9d she said stealthily. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you\r\nthink of her now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence!\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym fiercely. And, turning to the boy, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then you\r\nleft her to die?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, quickly and angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cHe did not leave her to\r\ndie! She sent him away. Whoever says he forsook her says what\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\ntrue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrouble no more about that,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Clym, with a quivering mouth.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat he did is a trifle in comparison with what he saw. Door kept\r\nshut, did you say? Kept shut, she looking out of window? Good heart of\r\nGod!\xe2\x80\x94what does it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child shrank away from the gaze of his questioner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said so,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the mother, \xe2\x80\x9cand Johnny\xe2\x80\x99s a God-fearing boy and\r\ntells no lies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Cast off by my son!\xe2\x80\x99 No, by my best life, dear mother, it is not so!\r\nBut by your son\xe2\x80\x99s, your son\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94May all murderesses get the torment they\r\ndeserve!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words Yeobright went forth from the little dwelling. The\r\npupils of his eyes, fixed steadfastly on blankness, were vaguely lit\r\nwith an icy shine; his mouth had passed into the phase more or less\r\nimaginatively rendered in studies of Oedipus. The strangest deeds were\r\npossible to his mood. But they were not possible to his situation.\r\nInstead of there being before him the pale face of Eustacia, and a\r\nmasculine shape unknown, there was only the imperturbable countenance\r\nof the heath, which, having defied the cataclysmal onsets of centuries,\r\nreduced to insignificance by its seamed and antique features the\r\nwildest turmoil of a single man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nEustacia Dresses Herself on a Black Morning\r\n\r\n\r\nA consciousness of a vast impassivity in all which lay around him took\r\npossession even of Yeobright in his wild walk towards Alderworth. He\r\nhad once before felt in his own person this overpowering of the fervid\r\nby the inanimate; but then it had tended to enervate a passion far\r\nsweeter than that which at present pervaded him. It was once when he\r\nstood parting from Eustacia in the moist still levels beyond the hills.\r\n\r\nBut dismissing all this he went onward home, and came to the front of\r\nhis house. The blinds of Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom were still closely drawn,\r\nfor she was no early riser. All the life visible was in the shape of a\r\nsolitary thrush cracking a small snail upon the door-stone for his\r\nbreakfast, and his tapping seemed a loud noise in the general silence\r\nwhich prevailed; but on going to the door Clym found it unfastened, the\r\nyoung girl who attended upon Eustacia being astir in the back part of\r\nthe premises. Yeobright entered and went straight to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\nThe noise of his arrival must have aroused her, for when he opened the\r\ndoor she was standing before the looking glass in her nightdress, the\r\nends of her hair gathered into one hand, with which she was coiling the\r\nwhole mass round her head, previous to beginning toilette operations.\r\nShe was not a woman given to speaking first at a meeting, and she\r\nallowed Clym to walk across in silence, without turning her head. He\r\ncame behind her, and she saw his face in the glass. It was ashy,\r\nhaggard, and terrible. Instead of starting towards him in sorrowful\r\nsurprise, as even Eustacia, undemonstrative wife as she was, would have\r\ndone in days before she burdened herself with a secret, she remained\r\nmotionless, looking at him in the glass. And while she looked the\r\ncarmine flush with which warmth and sound sleep had suffused her cheeks\r\nand neck dissolved from view, and the deathlike pallor in his face flew\r\nacross into hers. He was close enough to see this, and the sight\r\ninstigated his tongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what is the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said huskily. \xe2\x80\x9cI see it in your\r\nface.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer hand relinquished the rope of hair and dropped to her side, and the\r\npile of tresses, no longer supported, fell from the crown of her head\r\nabout her shoulders and over the white nightgown. She made no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yeobright peremptorily.\r\n\r\nThe blanching process did not cease in her, and her lips now became as\r\nwhite as her face. She turned to him and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Clym, I\xe2\x80\x99ll speak\r\nto you. Why do you return so early? Can I do anything for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you can listen to me. It seems that my wife is not very well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour face, my dear; your face. Or perhaps it is the pale morning light\r\nwhich takes your colour away? Now I am going to reveal a secret to you.\r\nHa-ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, that is ghastly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour laugh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s reason for ghastliness. Eustacia, you have held my happiness\r\nin the hollow of your hand, and like a devil you have dashed it down!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe started back from the dressing-table, retreated a few steps from\r\nhim, and looked him in the face. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! you think to frighten me,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, with a slight laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it worth while? I am undefended, and\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow extraordinary!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs there is ample time I will tell you, though you know well enough. I\r\nmean that it is extraordinary that you should be alone in my absence.\r\nTell me, now, where is he who was with you on the afternoon of the\r\nthirty-first of August? Under the bed? Up the chimney?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA shudder overcame her and shook the light fabric of her nightdress\r\nthroughout. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not remember dates so exactly,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot\r\nrecollect that anybody was with me besides yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yeobright, his voice growing louder and harsher,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwas the day you shut the door against my mother and killed her. O, it\r\nis too much\xe2\x80\x94too bad!\xe2\x80\x9d He leant over the footpiece of the bedstead for a\r\nfew moments, with his back towards her; then rising again\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\r\ntell me! tell me\xe2\x80\x94do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, rushing up to her and seizing\r\nher by the loose folds of her sleeve.\r\n\r\nThe superstratum of timidity which often overlies those who are daring\r\nand defiant at heart had been passed through, and the mettlesome\r\nsubstance of the woman was reached. The red blood inundated her face,\r\npreviously so pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a low voice, regarding him with\r\na proud smile. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will not alarm me by holding on so; but it would be\r\na pity to tear my sleeve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of letting go he drew her closer to him. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me the\r\nparticulars of\xe2\x80\x94my mother\xe2\x80\x99s death,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a hard, panting whisper;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClym,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think you dare do anything to me\r\nthat I dare not bear? But before you strike me listen. You will get\r\nnothing from me by a blow, even though it should kill me, as it\r\nprobably will. But perhaps you do not wish me to speak\xe2\x80\x94killing may be\r\nall you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKill you! Do you expect it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo less degree of rage against me will match your previous grief for\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhew\xe2\x80\x94I shall not kill you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said contemptuously, as if under a\r\nsudden change of purpose. \xe2\x80\x9cI did think of it; but\xe2\x80\x94I shall not. That\r\nwould be making a martyr of you, and sending you to where she is; and I\r\nwould keep you away from her till the universe come to an end, if I\r\ncould.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI almost wish you would kill me,\xe2\x80\x9d said she with gloomy bitterness. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis with no strong desire, I assure you, that I play the part I have\r\nlately played on earth. You are no blessing, my husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shut the door\xe2\x80\x94you looked out of the window upon her\xe2\x80\x94you had a man\r\nin the house with you\xe2\x80\x94you sent her away to die. The inhumanity\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ntreachery\xe2\x80\x94I will not touch you\xe2\x80\x94stand away from me\xe2\x80\x94and confess every\r\nword!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever! I\xe2\x80\x99ll hold my tongue like the very death that I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\nmeeting, even though I can clear myself of half you believe by\r\nspeaking. Yes. I will! Who of any dignity would take the trouble to\r\nclear cobwebs from a wild man\xe2\x80\x99s mind after such language as this? No;\r\nlet him go on, and think his narrow thoughts, and run his head into the\r\nmire. I have other cares.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis too much\xe2\x80\x94but I must spare you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor charity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy my wretched soul you sting me, Eustacia! I can keep it up, and\r\nhotly too. Now, then, madam, tell me his name!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, I am resolved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow often does he write to you? Where does he put his letters\xe2\x80\x94when\r\ndoes he meet you? Ah, his letters! Do you tell me his name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll find it myself.\xe2\x80\x9d His eyes had fallen upon a small desk that\r\nstood near, on which she was accustomed to write her letters. He went\r\nto it. It was locked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnlock this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no right to say it. That\xe2\x80\x99s mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout another word he seized the desk and dashed it to the floor. The\r\nhinge burst open, and a number of letters tumbled out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia, stepping before him with more excitement than\r\nshe had hitherto shown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come! stand away! I must see them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at the letters as they lay, checked her feeling and moved\r\nindifferently aside; when he gathered them up, and examined them.\r\n\r\nBy no stretch of meaning could any but a harmless construction be\r\nplaced upon a single one of the letters themselves. The solitary\r\nexception was an empty envelope directed to her, and the handwriting\r\nwas Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s. Yeobright held it up. Eustacia was doggedly silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you read, madam? Look at this envelope. Doubtless we shall find\r\nmore soon, and what was inside them. I shall no doubt be gratified by\r\nlearning in good time what a well-finished and full-blown adept in a\r\ncertain trade my lady is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you say it to me\xe2\x80\x94do you?\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped.\r\n\r\nHe searched further, but found nothing more. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was in this letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk the writer. Am I your hound that you should talk to me in this\r\nway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you brave me? do you stand me out, mistress? Answer. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look at\r\nme with those eyes if you would bewitch me again! Sooner than that I\r\ndie. You refuse to answer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you after this, if I were as innocent as the sweetest\r\nbabe in heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich you are not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I am not absolutely,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not done what you\r\nsuppose; but if to have done no harm at all is the only innocence\r\nrecognized, I am beyond forgiveness. But I require no help from your\r\nconscience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can resist, and resist again! Instead of hating you I could, I\r\nthink, mourn for and pity you, if you were contrite, and would confess\r\nall. Forgive you I never can. I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of your lover\xe2\x80\x94I will give\r\nyou the benefit of the doubt in that matter, for it only affects me\r\npersonally. But the other\xe2\x80\x94had you half-killed _me_, had it been that\r\nyou wilfully took the sight away from these feeble eyes of mine, I\r\ncould have forgiven you. But _that\xe2\x80\x99s_ too much for nature!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay no more. I will do without your pity. But I would have saved you\r\nfrom uttering what you will regret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going away now. I shall leave you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need not go, as I am going myself. You will keep just as far away\r\nfrom me by staying here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall her to mind\xe2\x80\x94think of her\xe2\x80\x94what goodness there was in her\xe2\x80\x94it showed\r\nin every line of her face! Most women, even when but slightly annoyed,\r\nshow a flicker of evil in some curl of the mouth or some corner of the\r\ncheek; but as for her, never in her angriest moments was there anything\r\nmalicious in her look. She was angered quickly, but she forgave just as\r\nreadily, and underneath her pride there was the meekness of a child.\r\nWhat came of it?\xe2\x80\x94what cared you? You hated her just as she was learning\r\nto love you. O! couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you see what was best for you, but must bring\r\na curse upon me, and agony and death upon her, by doing that cruel\r\ndeed! What was the fellow\xe2\x80\x99s name who was keeping you company and\r\ncausing you to add cruelty to her to your wrong to me? Was it Wildeve?\r\nWas it poor Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s husband? Heaven, what wickedness! Lost your\r\nvoice, have you? It is natural after detection of that most noble\r\ntrick.... Eustacia, didn\xe2\x80\x99t any tender thought of your own mother lead\r\nyou to think of being gentle to mine at such a time of weariness? Did\r\nnot one grain of pity enter your heart as she turned away? Think what a\r\nvast opportunity was then lost of beginning a forgiving and honest\r\ncourse. Why did not you kick him out, and let her in, and say I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nan honest wife and a noble woman from this hour? Had I told you to go\r\nand quench eternally our last flickering chance of happiness here you\r\ncould have done no worse. Well, she\xe2\x80\x99s asleep now; and have you a\r\nhundred gallants, neither they nor you can insult her any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou exaggerate fearfully,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a faint, weary voice; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\ncannot enter into my defence\xe2\x80\x94it is not worth doing. You are nothing to\r\nme in future, and the past side of the story may as well remain untold.\r\nI have lost all through you, but I have not complained. Your blunders\r\nand misfortunes may have been a sorrow to you, but they have been a\r\nwrong to me. All persons of refinement have been scared away from me\r\nsince I sank into the mire of marriage. Is this your cherishing\xe2\x80\x94to put\r\nme into a hut like this, and keep me like the wife of a hind? You\r\ndeceived me\xe2\x80\x94not by words, but by appearances, which are less seen\r\nthrough than words. But the place will serve as well as any other\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nsomewhere to pass from\xe2\x80\x94into my grave.\xe2\x80\x9d Her words were smothered in her\r\nthroat, and her head drooped down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean by that. Am I the cause of your sin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(Eustacia made a trembling motion towards him.) \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, you can begin to\r\nshed tears and offer me your hand? Good God! can you? No, not I. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nnot commit the fault of taking that.\xe2\x80\x9d (The hand she had offered dropped\r\nnervelessly, but the tears continued flowing.) \xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take\r\nit, if only for the sake of my own foolish kisses that were wasted\r\nthere before I knew what I cherished. How bewitched I was! How could\r\nthere be any good in a woman that everybody spoke ill of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, O, O!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, breaking down at last; and, shaking with sobs\r\nwhich choked her, she sank upon her knees. \xe2\x80\x9cO, will you have done! O,\r\nyou are too relentless\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s a limit to the cruelty of savages! I\r\nhave held out long\xe2\x80\x94but you crush me down. I beg for mercy\xe2\x80\x94I cannot bear\r\nthis any longer\xe2\x80\x94it is inhuman to go further with this! If I had\xe2\x80\x94killed\r\nyour\xe2\x80\x94mother with my own hand\xe2\x80\x94I should not deserve such a scourging to\r\nthe bone as this. O, O! God have mercy upon a miserable woman!... You\r\nhave beaten me in this game\xe2\x80\x94I beg you to stay your hand in pity!... I\r\nconfess that I\xe2\x80\x94wilfully did not undo the door the first time she\r\nknocked\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94I should have unfastened it the second\xe2\x80\x94if I had not thought\r\nyou had gone to do it yourself. When I found you had not I opened it,\r\nbut she was gone. That\xe2\x80\x99s the extent of my crime\xe2\x80\x94towards _her_. Best\r\nnatures commit bad faults sometimes, don\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x94I think they do. Now I\r\nwill leave you\xe2\x80\x94for ever and ever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell all, and I _will_ pity you. Was the man in the house with you\r\nWildeve?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said desperately through her sobbing. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ninsist further\xe2\x80\x94I cannot tell. I am going from this house. We cannot\r\nboth stay here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need not go\xe2\x80\x94I will go. You can stay here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I will dress, and then I will go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere I came from, or _else_where.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hastily dressed herself, Yeobright moodily walking up and down the\r\nroom the whole of the time. At last all her things were on. Her little\r\nhands quivered so violently as she held them to her chin to fasten her\r\nbonnet that she could not tie the strings, and after a few moments she\r\nrelinquished the attempt. Seeing this he moved forward and said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\r\nme tie them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe assented in silence, and lifted her chin. For once at least in her\r\nlife she was totally oblivious of the charm of her attitude. But he was\r\nnot, and he turned his eyes aside, that he might not be tempted to\r\nsoftness.\r\n\r\nThe strings were tied; she turned from him. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you still prefer going\r\naway yourself to my leaving you?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well\xe2\x80\x94let it be. And when you will confess to the man I may pity\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe flung her shawl about her and went downstairs, leaving him standing\r\nin the room.\r\n\r\nEustacia had not long been gone when there came a knock at the door of\r\nthe bedroom; and Yeobright said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the servant; and she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cSomebody from Mrs. Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s have\r\ncalled to tell \xe2\x80\x99ee that the mis\xe2\x80\x99ess and the baby are getting on\r\nwonderful well, and the baby\xe2\x80\x99s name is to be Eustacia Clementine.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthe girl retired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a mockery!\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym. \xe2\x80\x9cThis unhappy marriage of mine to be\r\nperpetuated in that child\xe2\x80\x99s name!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nThe Ministrations of a Half-forgotten One\r\n\r\n\r\nEustacia\xe2\x80\x99s journey was at first as vague in direction as that of\r\nthistledown on the wind. She did not know what to do. She wished it had\r\nbeen night instead of morning, that she might at least have borne her\r\nmisery without the possibility of being seen. Tracing mile after mile\r\nalong between the dying ferns and the wet white spiders\xe2\x80\x99 webs, she at\r\nlength turned her steps towards her grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s house. She found the\r\nfront door closed and locked. Mechanically she went round to the end\r\nwhere the stable was, and on looking in at the stable door she saw\r\nCharley standing within.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Vye is not at home?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lad in a flutter of feeling; \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s gone to\r\nWeatherbury, and won\xe2\x80\x99t be home till night. And the servant is gone home\r\nfor a holiday. So the house is locked up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEustacia\xe2\x80\x99s face was not visible to Charley as she stood at the doorway,\r\nher back being to the sky, and the stable but indifferently lighted;\r\nbut the wildness of her manner arrested his attention. She turned and\r\nwalked away across the enclosure to the gate, and was hidden by the\r\nbank.\r\n\r\nWhen she had disappeared Charley, with misgiving in his eyes, slowly\r\ncame from the stable door, and going to another point in the bank he\r\nlooked over. Eustacia was leaning against it on the outside, her face\r\ncovered with her hands, and her head pressing the dewy heather which\r\nbearded the bank\xe2\x80\x99s outer side. She appeared to be utterly indifferent\r\nto the circumstance that her bonnet, hair, and garments were becoming\r\nwet and disarranged by the moisture of her cold, harsh pillow. Clearly\r\nsomething was wrong.\r\n\r\nCharley had always regarded Eustacia as Eustacia had regarded Clym when\r\nshe first beheld him\xe2\x80\x94as a romantic and sweet vision, scarcely\r\nincarnate. He had been so shut off from her by the dignity of her look\r\nand the pride of her speech, except at that one blissful interval when\r\nhe was allowed to hold her hand, that he had hardly deemed her a woman,\r\nwingless and earthly, subject to household conditions and domestic\r\njars. The inner details of her life he had only conjectured. She had\r\nbeen a lovely wonder, predestined to an orbit in which the whole of his\r\nown was but a point; and this sight of her leaning like a helpless,\r\ndespairing creature against a wild wet bank filled him with an amazed\r\nhorror. He could no longer remain where he was. Leaping over, he came\r\nup, touched her with his finger, and said tenderly, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are poorly,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am. What can I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEustacia started up, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Charley\xe2\x80\x94you have followed me. You\r\ndid not think when I left home in the summer that I should come back\r\nlike this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not, dear ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Can I help you now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid not. I wish I could get into the house. I feel\r\ngiddy\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLean on my arm, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, till we get to the porch, and I will try to\r\nopen the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe supported her to the porch, and there depositing her on a seat\r\nhastened to the back, climbed to a window by the help of a ladder, and\r\ndescending inside opened the door. Next he assisted her into the room,\r\nwhere there was an old-fashioned horsehair settee as large as a donkey\r\nwagon. She lay down here, and Charley covered her with a cloak he found\r\nin the hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I get you something to eat and drink?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, Charley. But I suppose there is no fire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can light it, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe vanished, and she heard a splitting of wood and a blowing of\r\nbellows; and presently he returned, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI have lighted a fire in\r\nthe kitchen, and now I\xe2\x80\x99ll light one here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lit the fire, Eustacia dreamily observing him from her couch. When\r\nit was blazing up he said, \xe2\x80\x9cShall I wheel you round in front of it,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am, as the morning is chilly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I go and bring the victuals now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, do,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured languidly.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone, and the dull sounds occasionally reached her ears of\r\nhis movements in the kitchen, she forgot where she was, and had for a\r\nmoment to consider by an effort what the sounds meant. After an\r\ninterval which seemed short to her whose thoughts were elsewhere, he\r\ncame in with a tray on which steamed tea and toast, though it was\r\nnearly lunch-time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlace it on the table,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be ready soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did so, and retired to the door; when, however, he perceived that\r\nshe did not move he came back a few steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me hold it to you, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to get up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charley. He\r\nbrought the tray to the front of the couch, where he knelt down,\r\nadding, \xe2\x80\x9cI will hold it for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEustacia sat up and poured out a cup of tea. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are very kind to me,\r\nCharley,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured as she sipped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I ought to be,\xe2\x80\x9d said he diffidently, taking great trouble not to\r\nrest his eyes upon her, though this was their only natural position,\r\nEustacia being immediately before him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have been kind to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow have I?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou let me hold your hand when you were a maiden at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, so I did. Why did I do that? My mind is lost\xe2\x80\x94it had to do with the\r\nmumming, had it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you wanted to go in my place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember. I do indeed remember\xe2\x80\x94too well!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe again became utterly downcast; and Charley, seeing that she was not\r\ngoing to eat or drink any more, took away the tray.\r\n\r\nAfterwards he occasionally came in to see if the fire was burning, to\r\nask her if she wanted anything, to tell her that the wind had shifted\r\nfrom south to west, to ask her if she would like him to gather her some\r\nblackberries; to all which inquiries she replied in the negative or\r\nwith indifference.\r\n\r\nShe remained on the settee some time longer, when she aroused herself\r\nand went upstairs. The room in which she had formerly slept still\r\nremained much as she had left it, and the recollection that this forced\r\nupon her of her own greatly changed and infinitely worsened situation\r\nagain set on her face the undetermined and formless misery which it had\r\nworn on her first arrival. She peeped into her grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s room,\r\nthrough which the fresh autumn air was blowing from the open window.\r\nHer eye was arrested by what was a familiar sight enough, though it\r\nbroke upon her now with a new significance.\r\n\r\nIt was a brace of pistols, hanging near the head of her grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbed, which he always kept there loaded, as a precaution against\r\npossible burglars, the house being very lonely. Eustacia regarded them\r\nlong, as if they were the page of a book in which she read a new and a\r\nstrange matter. Quickly, like one afraid of herself, she returned\r\ndownstairs and stood in deep thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could only do it!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be doing much good to\r\nmyself and all connected with me, and no harm to a single one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe idea seemed to gather force within her, and she remained in a fixed\r\nattitude nearly ten minutes, when a certain finality was expressed in\r\nher gaze, and no longer the blankness of indecision.\r\n\r\nShe turned and went up the second time\xe2\x80\x94softly and stealthily now\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nentered her grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s room, her eyes at once seeking the head of\r\nthe bed. The pistols were gone.\r\n\r\nThe instant quashing of her purpose by their absence affected her brain\r\nas a sudden vacuum affects the body\xe2\x80\x94she nearly fainted. Who had done\r\nthis? There was only one person on the premises besides herself.\r\nEustacia involuntarily turned to the open window which overlooked the\r\ngarden as far as the bank that bounded it. On the summit of the latter\r\nstood Charley, sufficiently elevated by its height to see into the\r\nroom. His gaze was directed eagerly and solicitously upon her.\r\n\r\nShe went downstairs to the door and beckoned to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have taken them away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw you looking at them too long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has that to do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been heart-broken all the morning, as if you did not want to\r\nlive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I could not bear to leave them in your way. There was meaning in\r\nyour look at them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are they now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLocked up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the stable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive them to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou refuse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do. I care too much for you to give \xe2\x80\x99em up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned aside, her face for the first time softening from the stony\r\nimmobility of the earlier day, and the corners of her mouth resuming\r\nsomething of that delicacy of cut which was always lost in her moments\r\nof despair. At last she confronted him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I not die if I wish?\xe2\x80\x9d she said tremulously. \xe2\x80\x9cI have made a\r\nbad bargain with life, and I am weary of it\xe2\x80\x94weary. And now you have\r\nhindered my escape. O, why did you, Charley! What makes death painful\r\nexcept the thought of others\xe2\x80\x99 grief?\xe2\x80\x94and that is absent in my case, for\r\nnot a sigh would follow me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, it is trouble that has done this! I wish in my very soul that he\r\nwho brought it about might die and rot, even if \xe2\x80\x99tis transportation to\r\nsay it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharley, no more of that. What do you mean to do about this you have\r\nseen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep it close as night, if you promise not to think of it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need not fear. The moment has passed. I promise.\xe2\x80\x9d She then went\r\naway, entered the house, and lay down.\r\n\r\nLater in the afternoon her grandfather returned. He was about to\r\nquestion her categorically, but on looking at her he withheld his\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is too bad to talk of,\xe2\x80\x9d she slowly returned in answer to his\r\nglance. \xe2\x80\x9cCan my old room be got ready for me tonight, Grandfather? I\r\nshall want to occupy it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not ask what it all meant, or why she had left her husband, but\r\nordered the room to be prepared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\nAn Old Move Inadvertently Repeated\r\n\r\n\r\nCharley\xe2\x80\x99s attentions to his former mistress were unbounded. The only\r\nsolace to his own trouble lay in his attempts to relieve hers. Hour\r\nafter hour he considered her wants; he thought of her presence there\r\nwith a sort of gratitude, and, while uttering imprecations on the cause\r\nof her unhappiness, in some measure blessed the result. Perhaps she\r\nwould always remain there, he thought, and then he would be as happy as\r\nhe had been before. His dread was lest she should think fit to return\r\nto Alderworth, and in that dread his eyes, with all the inquisitiveness\r\nof affection, frequently sought her face when she was not observing\r\nhim, as he would have watched the head of a stockdove to learn if it\r\ncontemplated flight. Having once really succoured her, and possibly\r\npreserved her from the rashest of acts, he mentally assumed in addition\r\na guardian\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility for her welfare.\r\n\r\nFor this reason he busily endeavoured to provide her with pleasant\r\ndistractions, bringing home curious objects which he found in the\r\nheath, such as white trumpet-shaped mosses, redheaded lichens, stone\r\narrowheads used by the old tribes on Egdon, and faceted crystals from\r\nthe hollows of flints. These he deposited on the premises in such\r\npositions that she should see them as if by accident.\r\n\r\nA week passed, Eustacia never going out of the house. Then she walked\r\ninto the enclosed plot and looked through her grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s spyglass,\r\nas she had been in the habit of doing before her marriage. One day she\r\nsaw, at a place where the highroad crossed the distant valley, a\r\nheavily laden wagon passing along. It was piled with household\r\nfurniture. She looked again and again, and recognized it to be her own.\r\nIn the evening her grandfather came indoors with a rumour that\r\nYeobright had removed that day from Alderworth to the old house at\r\nBlooms-End.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion when reconnoitring thus she beheld two female\r\nfigures walking in the vale. The day was fine and clear; and the\r\npersons not being more than half a mile off she could see their every\r\ndetail with the telescope. The woman walking in front carried a white\r\nbundle in her arms, from one end of which hung a long appendage of\r\ndrapery; and when the walkers turned, so that the sun fell more\r\ndirectly upon them, Eustacia could see that the object was a baby. She\r\ncalled Charley, and asked him if he knew who they were, though she well\r\nguessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Wildeve and the nurse-girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe nurse is carrying the baby?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, \xe2\x80\x99tis Mrs. Wildeve carrying that,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cand the nurse\r\nwalks behind carrying nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lad was in good spirits that day, for the Fifth of November had\r\nagain come round, and he was planning yet another scheme to divert her\r\nfrom her too absorbing thoughts. For two successive years his mistress\r\nhad seemed to take pleasure in lighting a bonfire on the bank\r\noverlooking the valley; but this year she had apparently quite\r\nforgotten the day and the customary deed. He was careful not to remind\r\nher, and went on with his secret preparations for a cheerful surprise,\r\nthe more zealously that he had been absent last time and unable to\r\nassist. At every vacant minute he hastened to gather furze-stumps,\r\nthorn-tree roots, and other solid materials from the adjacent slopes,\r\nhiding them from cursory view.\r\n\r\nThe evening came, and Eustacia was still seemingly unconscious of the\r\nanniversary. She had gone indoors after her survey through the glass,\r\nand had not been visible since. As soon as it was quite dark Charley\r\nbegan to build the bonfire, choosing precisely that spot on the bank\r\nwhich Eustacia had chosen at previous times.\r\n\r\nWhen all the surrounding bonfires had burst into existence Charley\r\nkindled his, and arranged its fuel so that it should not require\r\ntending for some time. He then went back to the house, and lingered\r\nround the door and windows till she should by some means or other learn\r\nof his achievement and come out to witness it. But the shutters were\r\nclosed, the door remained shut, and no heed whatever seemed to be taken\r\nof his performance. Not liking to call her he went back and replenished\r\nthe fire, continuing to do this for more than half an hour. It was not\r\ntill his stock of fuel had greatly diminished that he went to the back\r\ndoor and sent in to beg that Mrs. Yeobright would open the\r\nwindow-shutters and see the sight outside.\r\n\r\nEustacia, who had been sitting listlessly in the parlour, started up at\r\nthe intelligence and flung open the shutters. Facing her on the bank\r\nblazed the fire, which at once sent a ruddy glare into the room where\r\nshe was, and overpowered the candles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell done, Charley!\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Vye from the chimney-corner. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\nhope it is not my wood that he\xe2\x80\x99s burning.... Ah, it was this time last\r\nyear that I met with that man Venn, bringing home Thomasin Yeobright\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nbe sure it was! Well, who would have thought that girl\xe2\x80\x99s troubles would\r\nhave ended so well? What a snipe you were in that matter, Eustacia! Has\r\nyour husband written to you yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eustacia, looking vaguely through the window at the fire,\r\nwhich just then so much engaged her mind that she did not resent her\r\ngrandfather\xe2\x80\x99s blunt opinion. She could see Charley\xe2\x80\x99s form on the bank,\r\nshovelling and stirring the fire; and there flashed upon her\r\nimagination some other form which that fire might call up.\r\n\r\nShe left the room, put on her garden bonnet and cloak, and went out.\r\nReaching the bank, she looked over with a wild curiosity and misgiving,\r\nwhen Charley said to her, with a pleased sense of himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI made it\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 purpose for you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I wish you to put it out now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will soon burn down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charley, rather disappointed. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it not\r\na pity to knock it out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d she musingly answered.\r\n\r\nThey stood in silence, broken only by the crackling of the flames, till\r\nCharley, perceiving that she did not want to talk to him, moved\r\nreluctantly away.\r\n\r\nEustacia remained within the bank looking at the fire, intending to go\r\nindoors, yet lingering still. Had she not by her situation been\r\ninclined to hold in indifference all things honoured of the gods and of\r\nmen she would probably have come away. But her state was so hopeless\r\nthat she could play with it. To have lost is less disturbing than to\r\nwonder if we may possibly have won; and Eustacia could now, like other\r\npeople at such a stage, take a standing-point outside herself, observe\r\nherself as a disinterested spectator, and think what a sport for Heaven\r\nthis woman Eustacia was.\r\n\r\nWhile she stood she heard a sound. It was the splash of a stone in the\r\npond.\r\n\r\nHad Eustacia received the stone full in the bosom her heart could not\r\nhave given a more decided thump. She had thought of the possibility of\r\nsuch a signal in answer to that which had been unwittingly given by\r\nCharley; but she had not expected it yet. How prompt Wildeve was! Yet\r\nhow could he think her capable of deliberately wishing to renew their\r\nassignations now? An impulse to leave the spot, a desire to stay,\r\nstruggled within her; and the desire held its own. More than that it\r\ndid not do, for she refrained even from ascending the bank and looking\r\nover. She remained motionless, not disturbing a muscle of her face or\r\nraising her eyes; for were she to turn up her face the fire on the bank\r\nwould shine upon it, and Wildeve might be looking down.\r\n\r\nThere was a second splash into the pond.\r\n\r\nWhy did he stay so long without advancing and looking over? Curiosity\r\nhad its way\xe2\x80\x94she ascended one or two of the earth-steps in the bank and\r\nglanced out.\r\n\r\nWildeve was before her. He had come forward after throwing the last\r\npebble, and the fire now shone into each of their faces from the bank\r\nstretching breast-high between them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not light it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Eustacia quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was lit without my\r\nknowledge. Don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t come over to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you been living here all these days without telling me? You\r\nhave left your home. I fear I am something to blame in this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not let in his mother; that\xe2\x80\x99s how it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not deserve what you have got, Eustacia; you are in great\r\nmisery; I see it in your eyes, your mouth, and all over you. My poor,\r\npoor girl!\xe2\x80\x9d He stepped over the bank. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are beyond everything\r\nunhappy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; not exactly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has been pushed too far\xe2\x80\x94it is killing you\xe2\x80\x94I do think it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer usually quiet breathing had grown quicker with his words. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe began, and then burst into quivering sobs, shaken to the very heart\r\nby the unexpected voice of pity\xe2\x80\x94a sentiment whose existence in relation\r\nto herself she had almost forgotten.\r\n\r\nThis outbreak of weeping took Eustacia herself so much by surprise that\r\nshe could not leave off, and she turned aside from him in some shame,\r\nthough turning hid nothing from him. She sobbed on desperately; then\r\nthe outpour lessened, and she became quieter. Wildeve had resisted the\r\nimpulse to clasp her, and stood without speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you not ashamed of me, who used never to be a crying animal?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked in a weak whisper as she wiped her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you go away?\r\nI wish you had not seen quite all that; it reveals too much by half.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might have wished it, because it makes me as sad as you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nwith emotion and deference. \xe2\x80\x9cAs for revealing\xe2\x80\x94the word is impossible\r\nbetween us two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not send for you\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t forget it, Damon; I am in pain, but I did\r\nnot send for you! As a wife, at least, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been straight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind\xe2\x80\x94I came. O, Eustacia, forgive me for the harm I have done\r\nyou in these two past years! I see more and more that I have been your\r\nruin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot you. This place I live in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, your generosity may naturally make you say that. But I am the\r\nculprit. I should either have done more or nothing at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought never to have hunted you out, or, having done it, I ought to\r\nhave persisted in retaining you. But of course I have no right to talk\r\nof that now. I will only ask this\xe2\x80\x94can I do anything for you? Is there\r\nanything on the face of the earth that a man can do to make you happier\r\nthan you are at present? If there is, I will do it. You may command me,\r\nEustacia, to the limit of my influence; and don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that I am\r\nricher now. Surely something can be done to save you from this! Such a\r\nrare plant in such a wild place it grieves me to see. Do you want\r\nanything bought? Do you want to go anywhere? Do you want to escape the\r\nplace altogether? Only say it, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything to put an end to\r\nthose tears, which but for me would never have been at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are each married to another person,\xe2\x80\x9d she said faintly; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nassistance from you would have an evil sound\xe2\x80\x94after\xe2\x80\x94after\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there\xe2\x80\x99s no preventing slanderers from having their fill at any\r\ntime; but you need not be afraid. Whatever I may feel I promise you on\r\nmy word of honour never to speak to you about\xe2\x80\x94or act upon\xe2\x80\x94until you say\r\nI may. I know my duty to Thomasin quite as well as I know my duty to\r\nyou as a woman unfairly treated. What shall I assist you in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn getting away from here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you wish to go to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a place in my mind. If you could help me as far as Budmouth I\r\ncan do all the rest. Steamers sail from there across the Channel, and\r\nso I can get to Paris, where I want to be. Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded earnestly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chelp me to get to Budmouth harbour without my grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s or my\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, and I can do all the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill it be safe to leave you there alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. I know Budmouth well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I go with you? I am rich now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay yes, sweet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was silent still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let me know when you wish to go. We shall be at our present\r\nhouse till December; after that we remove to Casterbridge. Command me\r\nin anything till that time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will think of this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said hurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhether I can honestly\r\nmake use of you as a friend, or must close with you as a lover\xe2\x80\x94that is\r\nwhat I must ask myself. If I wish to go and decide to accept your\r\ncompany I will signal to you some evening at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock punctually,\r\nand this will mean that you are to be ready with a horse and trap at\r\ntwelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock the same night to drive me to Budmouth harbour in time\r\nfor the morning boat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will look out every night at eight, and no signal shall escape me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow please go away. If I decide on this escape I can only meet you\r\nonce more unless\xe2\x80\x94I cannot go without you. Go\xe2\x80\x94I cannot bear it longer.\r\nGo\xe2\x80\x94go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWildeve slowly went up the steps and descended into the darkness on the\r\nother side; and as he walked he glanced back, till the bank blotted out\r\nher form from his further view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\nThomasin Argues with Her Cousin, and He Writes a Letter\r\n\r\n\r\nYeobright was at this time at Blooms-End, hoping that Eustacia would\r\nreturn to him. The removal of furniture had been accomplished only that\r\nday, though Clym had lived in the old house for more than a week. He\r\nhad spent the time in working about the premises, sweeping leaves from\r\nthe garden paths, cutting dead stalks from the flower beds, and nailing\r\nup creepers which had been displaced by the autumn winds. He took no\r\nparticular pleasure in these deeds, but they formed a screen between\r\nhimself and despair. Moreover, it had become a religion with him to\r\npreserve in good condition all that had lapsed from his mother\xe2\x80\x99s hands\r\nto his own.\r\n\r\nDuring these operations he was constantly on the watch for Eustacia.\r\nThat there should be no mistake about her knowing where to find him he\r\nhad ordered a notice board to be affixed to the garden gate at\r\nAlderworth, signifying in white letters whither he had removed. When a\r\nleaf floated to the earth he turned his head, thinking it might be her\r\nfoot-fall. A bird searching for worms in the mould of the flower-beds\r\nsounded like her hand on the latch of the gate; and at dusk, when soft,\r\nstrange ventriloquisms came from holes in the ground, hollow stalks,\r\ncurled dead leaves, and other crannies wherein breezes, worms, and\r\ninsects can work their will, he fancied that they were Eustacia,\r\nstanding without and breathing wishes of reconciliation.\r\n\r\nUp to this hour he had persevered in his resolve not to invite her\r\nback. At the same time the severity with which he had treated her\r\nlulled the sharpness of his regret for his mother, and awoke some of\r\nhis old solicitude for his mother\xe2\x80\x99s supplanter. Harsh feelings produce\r\nharsh usage, and this by reaction quenches the sentiments that gave it\r\nbirth. The more he reflected the more he softened. But to look upon his\r\nwife as innocence in distress was impossible, though he could ask\r\nhimself whether he had given her quite time enough\xe2\x80\x94if he had not come a\r\nlittle too suddenly upon her on that sombre morning.\r\n\r\nNow that the first flush of his anger had paled he was disinclined to\r\nascribe to her more than an indiscreet friendship with Wildeve, for\r\nthere had not appeared in her manner the signs of dishonour. And this\r\nonce admitted, an absolutely dark interpretation of her act towards his\r\nmother was no longer forced upon him.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the fifth November his thoughts of Eustacia were\r\nintense. Echoes from those past times when they had exchanged tender\r\nwords all the day long came like the diffused murmur of a seashore left\r\nmiles behind. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cshe might have brought herself to\r\ncommunicate with me before now, and confess honestly what Wildeve was\r\nto her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of remaining at home that night he determined to go and see\r\nThomasin and her husband. If he found opportunity he would allude to\r\nthe cause of the separation between Eustacia and himself, keeping\r\nsilence, however, on the fact that there was a third person in his\r\nhouse when his mother was turned away. If it proved that Wildeve was\r\ninnocently there he would doubtless openly mention it. If he were there\r\nwith unjust intentions Wildeve, being a man of quick feeling, might\r\npossibly say something to reveal the extent to which Eustacia was\r\ncompromised.\r\n\r\nBut on reaching his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s house he found that only Thomasin was at\r\nhome, Wildeve being at that time on his way towards the bonfire\r\ninnocently lit by Charley at Mistover. Thomasin then, as always, was\r\nglad to see Clym, and took him to inspect the sleeping baby, carefully\r\nscreening the candlelight from the infant\xe2\x80\x99s eyes with her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTamsin, have you heard that Eustacia is not with me now?\xe2\x80\x9d he said when\r\nthey had sat down again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomasin, alarmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not that I have left Alderworth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I never hear tidings from Alderworth unless you bring them. What\r\nis the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClym in a disturbed voice related to her his visit to Susan Nunsuch\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nboy, the revelation he had made, and what had resulted from his\r\ncharging Eustacia with having wilfully and heartlessly done the deed.\r\nHe suppressed all mention of Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s presence with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this, and I not knowing it!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Thomasin in an awestruck\r\ntone, \xe2\x80\x9cTerrible! What could have made her\xe2\x80\x94O, Eustacia! And when you\r\nfound it out you went in hot haste to her? Were you too cruel?\xe2\x80\x94or is\r\nshe really so wicked as she seems?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan a man be too cruel to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s enemy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can fancy so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll admit that he can. But now what is to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake it up again\xe2\x80\x94if a quarrel so deadly can ever be made up. I almost\r\nwish you had not told me. But do try to be reconciled. There are ways,\r\nafter all, if you both wish to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we do both wish to make it up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she\r\nhad wished it, would she not have sent to me by this time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to wish to, and yet you have not sent to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue; but I have been tossed to and fro in doubt if I ought, after\r\nsuch strong provocation. To see me now, Thomasin, gives you no idea of\r\nwhat I have been; of what depths I have descended to in these few last\r\ndays. O, it was a bitter shame to shut out my mother like that! Can I\r\never forget it, or even agree to see her again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe might not have known that anything serious would come of it, and\r\nperhaps she did not mean to keep Aunt out altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe says herself that she did not. But the fact remains that keep her\r\nout she did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve her sorry, and send for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow if she will not come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will prove her guilty, by showing that it is her habit to nourish\r\nenmity. But I do not think that for a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do this. I will wait for a day or two longer\xe2\x80\x94not longer than\r\ntwo days certainly; and if she does not send to me in that time I will\r\nindeed send to her. I thought to have seen Wildeve here tonight. Is he\r\nfrom home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThomasin blushed a little. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is merely gone out for a\r\nwalk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t he take you with him? The evening is fine. You want fresh\r\nair as well as he.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for going anywhere; besides, there is baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. Well, I have been thinking whether I should not consult your\r\nhusband about this as well as you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym steadily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancy I would not,\xe2\x80\x9d she quickly answered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt can do no good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer cousin looked her in the face. No doubt Thomasin was ignorant that\r\nher husband had any share in the events of that tragic afternoon; but\r\nher countenance seemed to signify that she concealed some suspicion or\r\nthought of the reputed tender relations between Wildeve and Eustacia in\r\ndays gone by.\r\n\r\nClym, however, could make nothing of it, and he rose to depart, more in\r\ndoubt than when he came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will write to her in a day or two?\xe2\x80\x9d said the young woman\r\nearnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cI do so hope the wretched separation may come to an end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t rejoice in my present state at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he left her and climbed over the hill to Blooms-End. Before going\r\nto bed he sat down and wrote the following letter:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMY DEAR EUSTACIA,\xe2\x80\x94I must obey my heart without consulting my reason too\r\nclosely. Will you come back to me? Do so, and the past shall never be\r\nmentioned. I was too severe; but O, Eustacia, the provocation! You\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know, you never will know, what those words of anger cost me\r\nwhich you drew down upon yourself. All that an honest man can promise\r\nyou I promise now, which is that from me you shall never suffer\r\nanything on this score again. After all the vows we have made,\r\nEustacia, I think we had better pass the remainder of our lives in\r\ntrying to keep them. Come to me, then, even if you reproach me. I have\r\nthought of your sufferings that morning on which I parted from you; I\r\nknow they were genuine, and they are as much as you ought to bear. Our\r\nlove must still continue. Such hearts as ours would never have been\r\ngiven us but to be concerned with each other. I could not ask you back\r\nat first, Eustacia, for I was unable to persuade myself that he who was\r\nwith you was not there as a lover. But if you will come and explain\r\ndistracting appearances I do not question that you can show your\r\nhonesty to me. Why have you not come before? Do you think I will not\r\nlisten to you? Surely not, when you remember the kisses and vows we\r\nexchanged under the summer moon. Return then, and you shall be warmly\r\nwelcomed. I can no longer think of you to your prejudice\xe2\x80\x94I am but too\r\nmuch absorbed in justifying you.\xe2\x80\x94Your husband as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nCLYM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he laid it in his desk, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing done.\r\nIf she does not come before tomorrow night I will send it to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at the house he had just left Thomasin sat sighing uneasily.\r\nFidelity to her husband had that evening induced her to conceal all\r\nsuspicion that Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s interest in Eustacia had not ended with his\r\nmarriage. But she knew nothing positive; and though Clym was her\r\nwell-beloved cousin there was one nearer to her still.\r\n\r\nWhen, a little later, Wildeve returned from his walk to Mistover,\r\nThomasin said, \xe2\x80\x9cDamon, where have you been? I was getting quite\r\nfrightened, and thought you had fallen into the river. I dislike being\r\nin the house by myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrightened?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, touching her cheek as if she were some domestic\r\nanimal. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I thought nothing could frighten you. It is that you are\r\ngetting proud, I am sure, and don\xe2\x80\x99t like living here since we have\r\nrisen above our business. Well, it is a tedious matter, this getting a\r\nnew house; but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have set about it sooner, unless our ten\r\nthousand pounds had been a hundred thousand, when we could have\r\nafforded to despise caution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind waiting\xe2\x80\x94I would rather stay here twelve months longer\r\nthan run any risk with baby. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t like your vanishing so in the\r\nevenings. There\xe2\x80\x99s something on your mind\xe2\x80\x94I know there is, Damon. You go\r\nabout so gloomily, and look at the heath as if it were somebody\xe2\x80\x99s gaol\r\ninstead of a nice wild place to walk in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked towards her with pitying surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, do you like Egdon\r\nHeath?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like what I was born near to; I admire its grim old face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh, my dear. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I do. There\xe2\x80\x99s only one thing unpleasant about Egdon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never take me with you when you walk there. Why do you wander so\r\nmuch in it yourself if you so dislike it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe inquiry, though a simple one, was plainly disconcerting, and he sat\r\ndown before replying. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you often see me there. Give an\r\ninstance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered triumphantly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you went out this evening I\r\nthought that as baby was asleep I would see where you were going to so\r\nmysteriously without telling me. So I ran out and followed behind you.\r\nYou stopped at the place where the road forks, looked round at the\r\nbonfires, and then said, \xe2\x80\x98Damn it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go!\xe2\x80\x99 And you went quickly up\r\nthe left-hand road. Then I stood and watched you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWildeve frowned, afterwards saying, with a forced smile, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what\r\nwonderful discovery did you make?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x94now you are angry, and we won\xe2\x80\x99t talk of this any more.\xe2\x80\x9d She went\r\nacross to him, sat on a footstool, and looked up in his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s how you always back out. We will go on\r\nwith it now we have begun. What did you next see? I particularly want\r\nto know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be like that, Damon!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t see anything. You\r\nvanished out of sight, and then I looked round at the bonfires and came\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps this is not the only time you have dogged my steps. Are you\r\ntrying to find out something bad about me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all! I have never done such a thing before, and I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave done it now if words had not sometimes been dropped about you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _do_ you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he impatiently asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say\xe2\x80\x94they say you used to go to Alderworth in the evenings, and it\r\nputs into my mind what I have heard about\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWildeve turned angrily and stood up in front of her. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nflourishing his hand in the air, \xe2\x80\x9cjust out with it, madam! I demand to\r\nknow what remarks you have heard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I heard that you used to be very fond of Eustacia\xe2\x80\x94nothing more\r\nthan that, though dropped in a bit-by-bit way. You ought not to be\r\nangry!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe observed that her eyes were brimming with tears. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere is nothing new in that, and of course I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be rough\r\ntowards you, so you need not cry. Now, don\xe2\x80\x99t let us speak of the\r\nsubject any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd no more was said, Thomasin being glad enough of a reason for not\r\nmentioning Clym\xe2\x80\x99s visit to her that evening, and his story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\nThe Night of the Sixth of November\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving resolved on flight Eustacia at times seemed anxious that\r\nsomething should happen to thwart her own intention. The only event\r\nthat could really change her position was the appearance of Clym. The\r\nglory which had encircled him as her lover was departed now; yet some\r\ngood simple quality of his would occasionally return to her memory and\r\nstir a momentary throb of hope that he would again present himself\r\nbefore her. But calmly considered it was not likely that such a\r\nseverance as now existed would ever close up\xe2\x80\x94she would have to live on\r\nas a painful object, isolated, and out of place. She had used to think\r\nof the heath alone as an uncongenial spot to be in; she felt it now of\r\nthe whole world.\r\n\r\nTowards evening on the sixth her determination to go away again\r\nrevived. About four o\xe2\x80\x99clock she packed up anew the few small articles\r\nshe had brought in her flight from Alderworth, and also some belonging\r\nto her which had been left here; the whole formed a bundle not too\r\nlarge to be carried in her hand for a distance of a mile or two. The\r\nscene without grew darker; mud-coloured clouds bellied downwards from\r\nthe sky like vast hammocks slung across it, and with the increase of\r\nnight a stormy wind arose; but as yet there was no rain.\r\n\r\nEustacia could not rest indoors, having nothing more to do, and she\r\nwandered to and fro on the hill, not far from the house she was soon to\r\nleave. In these desultory ramblings she passed the cottage of Susan\r\nNunsuch, a little lower down than her grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s. The door was ajar,\r\nand a riband of bright firelight fell over the ground without. As\r\nEustacia crossed the firebeams she appeared for an instant as distinct\r\nas a figure in a phantasmagoria\xe2\x80\x94a creature of light surrounded by an\r\narea of darkness; the moment passed, and she was absorbed in night\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nA woman who was sitting inside the cottage had seen and recognized her\r\nin that momentary irradiation. This was Susan herself, occupied in\r\npreparing a posset for her little boy, who, often ailing, was now\r\nseriously unwell. Susan dropped the spoon, shook her fist at the\r\nvanished figure, and then proceeded with her work in a musing, absent\r\nway.\r\n\r\nAt eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the hour at which Eustacia had promised to signal\r\nWildeve if ever she signalled at all, she looked around the premises to\r\nlearn if the coast was clear, went to the furze-rick, and pulled thence\r\na long-stemmed bough of that fuel. This she carried to the corner of\r\nthe bank, and, glancing behind to see if the shutters were all closed,\r\nshe struck a light, and kindled the furze. When it was thoroughly\r\nablaze Eustacia took it by the stem and waved it in the air above her\r\nhead till it had burned itself out.\r\n\r\nShe was gratified, if gratification were possible to such a mood, by\r\nseeing a similar light in the vicinity of Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s residence a minute\r\nor two later. Having agreed to keep watch at this hour every night, in\r\ncase she should require assistance, this promptness proved how strictly\r\nhe had held to his word. Four hours after the present time, that is, at\r\nmidnight, he was to be ready to drive her to Budmouth, as prearranged.\r\n\r\nEustacia returned to the house. Supper having been got over she retired\r\nearly, and sat in her bedroom waiting for the time to go by. The night\r\nbeing dark and threatening, Captain Vye had not strolled out to gossip\r\nin any cottage or to call at the inn, as was sometimes his custom on\r\nthese long autumn nights; and he sat sipping grog alone downstairs.\r\nAbout ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock there was a knock at the door. When the servant\r\nopened it the rays of the candle fell upon the form of Fairway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was a-forced to go to Lower Mistover tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand Mr.\r\nYeobright asked me to leave this here on my way; but, faith, I put it\r\nin the lining of my hat, and thought no more about it till I got back\r\nand was hasping my gate before going to bed. So I have run back with it\r\nat once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe handed in a letter and went his way. The girl brought it to the\r\ncaptain, who found that it was directed to Eustacia. He turned it over\r\nand over, and fancied that the writing was her husband\xe2\x80\x99s, though he\r\ncould not be sure. However, he decided to let her have it at once if\r\npossible, and took it upstairs for that purpose; but on reaching the\r\ndoor of her room and looking in at the keyhole he found there was no\r\nlight within, the fact being that Eustacia, without undressing, had\r\nflung herself upon the bed, to rest and gather a little strength for\r\nher coming journey. Her grandfather concluded from what he saw that he\r\nought not to disturb her; and descending again to the parlour he placed\r\nthe letter on the mantelpiece to give it to her in the morning.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock he went to bed himself, smoked for some time in his\r\nbedroom, put out his light at half-past eleven, and then, as was his\r\ninvariable custom, pulled up the blind before getting into bed, that he\r\nmight see which way the wind blew on opening his eyes in the morning,\r\nhis bedroom window commanding a view of the flagstaff and vane. Just as\r\nhe had lain down he was surprised to observe the white pole of the\r\nstaff flash into existence like a streak of phosphorus drawn downwards\r\nacross the shade of night without. Only one explanation met this\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nlight had been suddenly thrown upon the pole from the direction of the\r\nhouse. As everybody had retired to rest the old man felt it necessary\r\nto get out of bed, open the window softly, and look to the right and\r\nleft. Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom was lighted up, and it was the shine from her\r\nwindow which had lighted the pole. Wondering what had aroused her, he\r\nremained undecided at the window, and was thinking of fetching the\r\nletter to slip it under her door, when he heard a slight brushing of\r\ngarments on the partition dividing his room from the passage.\r\n\r\nThe captain concluded that Eustacia, feeling wakeful, had gone for a\r\nbook, and would have dismissed the matter as unimportant if he had not\r\nalso heard her distinctly weeping as she passed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is thinking of that husband of hers,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, the\r\nsilly goose! she had no business to marry him. I wonder if that letter\r\nis really his?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe arose, threw his boat-cloak round him, opened the door, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEustacia!\xe2\x80\x9d There was no answer. \xe2\x80\x9cEustacia!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated louder, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\r\nis a letter on the mantelpiece for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut no response was made to this statement save an imaginary one from\r\nthe wind, which seemed to gnaw at the corners of the house, and the\r\nstroke of a few drops of rain upon the windows.\r\n\r\nHe went on to the landing, and stood waiting nearly five minutes. Still\r\nshe did not return. He went back for a light, and prepared to follow\r\nher; but first he looked into her bedroom. There, on the outside of the\r\nquilt, was the impression of her form, showing that the bed had not\r\nbeen opened; and, what was more significant, she had not taken her\r\ncandlestick downstairs. He was now thoroughly alarmed; and hastily\r\nputting on his clothes he descended to the front door, which he himself\r\nhad bolted and locked. It was now unfastened. There was no longer any\r\ndoubt that Eustacia had left the house at this midnight hour; and\r\nwhither could she have gone? To follow her was almost impossible. Had\r\nthe dwelling stood in an ordinary road, two persons setting out, one in\r\neach direction, might have made sure of overtaking her; but it was a\r\nhopeless task to seek for anybody on a heath in the dark, the\r\npracticable directions for flight across it from any point being as\r\nnumerous as the meridians radiating from the pole. Perplexed what to\r\ndo, he looked into the parlour, and was vexed to find that the letter\r\nstill lay there untouched.\r\n\r\nAt half-past eleven, finding that the house was silent, Eustacia had\r\nlighted her candle, put on some warm outer wrappings, taken her bag in\r\nher hand, and, extinguishing the light again, descended the staircase.\r\nWhen she got into the outer air she found that it had begun to rain,\r\nand as she stood pausing at the door it increased, threatening to come\r\non heavily. But having committed herself to this line of action there\r\nwas no retreating for bad weather. Even the receipt of Clym\xe2\x80\x99s letter\r\nwould not have stopped her now. The gloom of the night was funereal;\r\nall nature seemed clothed in crape. The spiky points of the fir trees\r\nbehind the house rose into the sky like the turrets and pinnacles of an\r\nabbey. Nothing below the horizon was visible save a light which was\r\nstill burning in the cottage of Susan Nunsuch.\r\n\r\nEustacia opened her umbrella and went out from the enclosure by the\r\nsteps over the bank, after which she was beyond all danger of being\r\nperceived. Skirting the pool, she followed the path towards Rainbarrow,\r\noccasionally stumbling over twisted furze roots, tufts of rushes, or\r\noozing lumps of fleshy fungi, which at this season lay scattered about\r\nthe heath like the rotten liver and lungs of some colossal animal. The\r\nmoon and stars were closed up by cloud and rain to the degree of\r\nextinction. It was a night which led the traveller\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts\r\ninstinctively to dwell on nocturnal scenes of disaster in the\r\nchronicles of the world, on all that is terrible and dark in history\r\nand legend\xe2\x80\x94the last plague of Egypt, the destruction of Sennacherib\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhost, the agony in Gethsemane.\r\n\r\nEustacia at length reached Rainbarrow, and stood still there to think.\r\nNever was harmony more perfect than that between the chaos of her mind\r\nand the chaos of the world without. A sudden recollection had flashed\r\non her this moment\xe2\x80\x94she had not money enough for undertaking a long\r\njourney. Amid the fluctuating sentiments of the day her unpractical\r\nmind had not dwelt on the necessity of being well-provided, and now\r\nthat she thoroughly realized the conditions she sighed bitterly and\r\nceased to stand erect, gradually crouching down under the umbrella as\r\nif she were drawn into the Barrow by a hand from beneath. Could it be\r\nthat she was to remain a captive still? Money\xe2\x80\x94she had never felt its\r\nvalue before. Even to efface herself from the country means were\r\nrequired. To ask Wildeve for pecuniary aid without allowing him to\r\naccompany her was impossible to a woman with a shadow of pride left in\r\nher; to fly as his mistress\xe2\x80\x94and she knew that he loved her\xe2\x80\x94was of the\r\nnature of humiliation.\r\n\r\nAnyone who had stood by now would have pitied her, not so much on\r\naccount of her exposure to weather, and isolation from all of humanity\r\nexcept the mouldered remains inside the tumulus; but for that other\r\nform of misery which was denoted by the slightly rocking movement that\r\nher feelings imparted to her person. Extreme unhappiness weighed\r\nvisibly upon her. Between the drippings of the rain from her umbrella\r\nto her mantle, from her mantle to the heather, from the heather to the\r\nearth, very similar sounds could be heard coming from her lips; and the\r\ntearfulness of the outer scene was repeated upon her face. The wings of\r\nher soul were broken by the cruel obstructiveness of all about her; and\r\neven had she seen herself in a promising way of getting to Budmouth,\r\nentering a steamer, and sailing to some opposite port, she would have\r\nbeen but little more buoyant, so fearfully malignant were other things.\r\nShe uttered words aloud. When a woman in such a situation, neither old,\r\ndeaf, crazed, nor whimsical, takes upon herself to sob and soliloquize\r\naloud there is something grievous the matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I go, can I go?\xe2\x80\x9d she moaned. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not _great_ enough for me to\r\ngive myself to\xe2\x80\x94he does not suffice for my desire!... If he had been a\r\nSaul or a Bonaparte\xe2\x80\x94ah! But to break my marriage vow for him\xe2\x80\x94it is too\r\npoor a luxury!... And I have no money to go alone! And if I could, what\r\ncomfort to me? I must drag on next year, as I have dragged on this\r\nyear, and the year after that as before. How I have tried and tried to\r\nbe a splendid woman, and how destiny has been against me!... I do not\r\ndeserve my lot!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried in a frenzy of bitter revolt. \xe2\x80\x9cO, the\r\ncruelty of putting me into this ill-conceived world! I was capable of\r\nmuch; but I have been injured and blighted and crushed by things beyond\r\nmy control! O, how hard it is of Heaven to devise such tortures for me,\r\nwho have done no harm to Heaven at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe distant light which Eustacia had cursorily observed in leaving the\r\nhouse came, as she had divined, from the cottage window of Susan\r\nNunsuch. What Eustacia did not divine was the occupation of the woman\r\nwithin at that moment. Susan\xe2\x80\x99s sight of her passing figure earlier in\r\nthe evening, not five minutes after the sick boy\xe2\x80\x99s exclamation,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, I do feel so bad!\xe2\x80\x9d persuaded the matron that an evil influence\r\nwas certainly exercised by Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s propinquity.\r\n\r\nOn this account Susan did not go to bed as soon as the evening\xe2\x80\x99s work\r\nwas over, as she would have done at ordinary times. To counteract the\r\nmalign spell which she imagined poor Eustacia to be working, the boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother busied herself with a ghastly invention of superstition,\r\ncalculated to bring powerlessness, atrophy, and annihilation on any\r\nhuman being against whom it was directed. It was a practice well known\r\non Egdon at that date, and one that is not quite extinct at the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nShe passed with her candle into an inner room, where, among other\r\nutensils, were two large brown pans, containing together perhaps a\r\nhundredweight of liquid honey, the produce of the bees during the\r\nforegoing summer. On a shelf over the pans was a smooth and solid\r\nyellow mass of a hemispherical form, consisting of beeswax from the\r\nsame take of honey. Susan took down the lump, and cutting off several\r\nthin slices, heaped them in an iron ladle, with which she returned to\r\nthe living-room, and placed the vessel in the hot ashes of the\r\nfireplace. As soon as the wax had softened to the plasticity of dough\r\nshe kneaded the pieces together. And now her face became more intent.\r\nShe began moulding the wax; and it was evident from her manner of\r\nmanipulation that she was endeavouring to give it some preconceived\r\nform. The form was human.\r\n\r\nBy warming and kneading, cutting and twisting, dismembering and\r\nre-joining the incipient image she had in about a quarter of an hour\r\nproduced a shape which tolerably well resembled a woman, and was about\r\nsix inches high. She laid it on the table to get cold and hard.\r\nMeanwhile she took the candle and went upstairs to where the little boy\r\nwas lying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you notice, my dear, what Mrs. Eustacia wore this afternoon\r\nbesides the dark dress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA red ribbon round her neck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94except sandal-shoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA red ribbon and sandal-shoes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself.\r\n\r\nMrs. Nunsuch went and searched till she found a fragment of the\r\nnarrowest red ribbon, which she took downstairs and tied round the neck\r\nof the image. Then fetching ink and a quilt from the rickety bureau by\r\nthe window, she blackened the feet of the image to the extent\r\npresumably covered by shoes; and on the instep of each foot marked\r\ncross-lines in the shape taken by the sandalstrings of those days.\r\nFinally she tied a bit of black thread round the upper part of the\r\nhead, in faint resemblance to a snood worn for confining the hair.\r\n\r\nSusan held the object at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length and contemplated it with a\r\nsatisfaction in which there was no smile. To anybody acquainted with\r\nthe inhabitants of Egdon Heath the image would have suggested Eustacia\r\nYeobright.\r\n\r\nFrom her workbasket in the window-seat the woman took a paper of pins,\r\nof the old long and yellow sort, whose heads were disposed to come off\r\nat their first usage. These she began to thrust into the image in all\r\ndirections, with apparently excruciating energy. Probably as many as\r\nfifty were thus inserted, some into the head of the wax model, some\r\ninto the shoulders, some into the trunk, some upwards through the soles\r\nof the feet, till the figure was completely permeated with pins.\r\n\r\nShe turned to the fire. It had been of turf; and though the high heap\r\nof ashes which turf fires produce was somewhat dark and dead on the\r\noutside, upon raking it abroad with the shovel the inside of the mass\r\nshowed a glow of red heat. She took a few pieces of fresh turf from the\r\nchimney-corner and built them together over the glow, upon which the\r\nfire brightened. Seizing with the tongs the image that she had made of\r\nEustacia, she held it in the heat, and watched it as it began to waste\r\nslowly away. And while she stood thus engaged there came from between\r\nher lips a murmur of words.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange jargon\xe2\x80\x94the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Prayer repeated backwards\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nincantation usual in proceedings for obtaining unhallowed assistance\r\nagainst an enemy. Susan uttered the lugubrious discourse three times\r\nslowly, and when it was completed the image had considerably\r\ndiminished. As the wax dropped into the fire a long flame arose from\r\nthe spot, and curling its tongue round the figure ate still further\r\ninto its substance. A pin occasionally dropped with the wax, and the\r\nembers heated it red as it lay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\nRain, Darkness, and Anxious Wanderers\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the effigy of Eustacia was melting to nothing, and the fair woman\r\nherself was standing on Rainbarrow, her soul in an abyss of desolation\r\nseldom plumbed by one so young, Yeobright sat lonely at Blooms-End. He\r\nhad fulfilled his word to Thomasin by sending off Fairway with the\r\nletter to his wife, and now waited with increased impatience for some\r\nsound or signal of her return. Were Eustacia still at Mistover the very\r\nleast he expected was that she would send him back a reply tonight by\r\nthe same hand; though, to leave all to her inclination, he had\r\ncautioned Fairway not to ask for an answer. If one were handed to him\r\nhe was to bring it immediately; if not, he was to go straight home\r\nwithout troubling to come round to Blooms-End again that night.\r\n\r\nBut secretly Clym had a more pleasing hope. Eustacia might possibly\r\ndecline to use her pen\xe2\x80\x94it was rather her way to work silently\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nsurprise him by appearing at his door. How fully her mind was made up\r\nto do otherwise he did not know.\r\n\r\nTo Clym\xe2\x80\x99s regret it began to rain and blow hard as the evening\r\nadvanced. The wind rasped and scraped at the corners of the house, and\r\nfilliped the eavesdroppings like peas against the panes. He walked\r\nrestlessly about the untenanted rooms, stopping strange noises in\r\nwindows and doors by jamming splinters of wood into the casements and\r\ncrevices, and pressing together the leadwork of the quarries where it\r\nhad become loosened from the glass. It was one of those nights when\r\ncracks in the walls of old churches widen, when ancient stains on the\r\nceilings of decayed manor houses are renewed and enlarged from the size\r\nof a man\xe2\x80\x99s hand to an area of many feet. The little gate in the palings\r\nbefore his dwelling continually opened and clicked together again, but\r\nwhen he looked out eagerly nobody was there; it was as if invisible\r\nshapes of the dead were passing in on their way to visit him.\r\n\r\nBetween ten and eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, finding that neither Fairway nor\r\nanybody else came to him, he retired to rest, and despite his anxieties\r\nsoon fell asleep. His sleep, however, was not very sound, by reason of\r\nthe expectancy he had given way to, and he was easily awakened by a\r\nknocking which began at the door about an hour after. Clym arose and\r\nlooked out of the window. Rain was still falling heavily, the whole\r\nexpanse of heath before him emitting a subdued hiss under the downpour.\r\nIt was too dark to see anything at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\nLight footsteps shifted their position in the porch, and he could just\r\ndistinguish in a plaintive female voice the words, \xe2\x80\x9cO Clym, come down\r\nand let me in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe flushed hot with agitation. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely it is Eustacia!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. If\r\nso, she had indeed come to him unawares.\r\n\r\nHe hastily got a light, dressed himself, and went down. On his flinging\r\nopen the door the rays of the candle fell upon a woman closely wrapped\r\nup, who at once came forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThomasin!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed in an indescribable tone of disappointment.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Thomasin, and on such a night as this! O, where is Eustacia?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThomasin it was, wet, frightened, and panting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEustacia? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Clym; but I can think,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with much\r\nperturbation. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me come in and rest\xe2\x80\x94I will explain this. There is a\r\ngreat trouble brewing\xe2\x80\x94my husband and Eustacia!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think my husband is going to leave me or do something dreadful\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x94Clym, will you go and see? I have nobody to help me but\r\nyou; Eustacia has not yet come home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went on breathlessly: \xe2\x80\x9cThen they are going to run off together! He\r\ncame indoors tonight about eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock and said in an off-hand way,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tamsie, I have just found that I must go a journey.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98When?\xe2\x80\x99 I said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tonight,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98Where?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked him. \xe2\x80\x98I cannot tell you at\r\npresent,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98I shall be back again tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x99 He then went and\r\nbusied himself in looking up his things, and took no notice of me at\r\nall. I expected to see him start, but he did not, and then it came to\r\nbe ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when he said, \xe2\x80\x98You had better go to bed.\xe2\x80\x99 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat to do, and I went to bed. I believe he thought I fell asleep, for\r\nhalf an hour after that he came up and unlocked the oak chest we keep\r\nmoney in when we have much in the house and took out a roll of\r\nsomething which I believe was banknotes, though I was not aware that he\r\nhad \xe2\x80\x99em there. These he must have got from the bank when he went there\r\nthe other day. What does he want banknotes for, if he is only going off\r\nfor a day? When he had gone down I thought of Eustacia, and how he had\r\nmet her the night before\xe2\x80\x94I know he did meet her, Clym, for I followed\r\nhim part of the way; but I did not like to tell you when you called,\r\nand so make you think ill of him, as I did not think it was so serious.\r\nThen I could not stay in bed; I got up and dressed myself, and when I\r\nheard him out in the stable I thought I would come and tell you. So I\r\ncame downstairs without any noise and slipped out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he was not absolutely gone when you left?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Will you, dear Cousin Clym, go and try to persuade him not to go?\r\nHe takes no notice of what I say, and puts me off with the story of his\r\ngoing on a journey, and will be home tomorrow, and all that; but I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. I think you could influence him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym. \xe2\x80\x9cO, Eustacia!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThomasin carried in her arms a large bundle; and having by this time\r\nseated herself she began to unroll it, when a baby appeared as the\r\nkernel to the husks\xe2\x80\x94dry, warm, and unconscious of travel or rough\r\nweather. Thomasin briefly kissed the baby, and then found time to begin\r\ncrying as she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI brought baby, for I was afraid what might happen\r\nto her. I suppose it will be her death, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave her with\r\nRachel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClym hastily put together the logs on the hearth, raked abroad the\r\nembers, which were scarcely yet extinct, and blew up a flame with the\r\nbellows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDry yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go and get some more wood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t stay for that. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make up the fire. Will you go at\r\nonce\xe2\x80\x94please will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYeobright ran upstairs to finish dressing himself. While he was gone\r\nanother rapping came to the door. This time there was no delusion that\r\nit might be Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94the footsteps just preceding it had been heavy\r\nand slow. Yeobright thinking it might possibly be Fairway with a note\r\nin answer, descended again and opened the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Vye?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to a dripping figure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs my granddaughter here?\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen where is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you ought to know\xe2\x80\x94you are her husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly in name apparently,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym with rising excitement. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe\r\nshe means to elope tonight with Wildeve. I am just going to look to\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she has left my house; she left about half an hour ago. Who\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsitting there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy cousin Thomasin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain bowed in a preoccupied way to her. \xe2\x80\x9cI only hope it is no\r\nworse than an elopement,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorse? What\xe2\x80\x99s worse than the worst a wife can do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have been told a strange tale. Before starting in search of\r\nher I called up Charley, my stable lad. I missed my pistols the other\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPistols?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said at the time that he took them down to clean. He has now owned\r\nthat he took them because he saw Eustacia looking curiously at them;\r\nand she afterwards owned to him that she was thinking of taking her\r\nlife, but bound him to secrecy, and promised never to think of such a\r\nthing again. I hardly suppose she will ever have bravado enough to use\r\none of them; but it shows what has been lurking in her mind; and people\r\nwho think of that sort of thing once think of it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are the pistols?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSafely locked up. O no, she won\xe2\x80\x99t touch them again. But there are more\r\nways of letting out life than through a bullet-hole. What did you\r\nquarrel about so bitterly with her to drive her to all this? You must\r\nhave treated her badly indeed. Well, I was always against the marriage,\r\nand I was right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going with me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Yeobright, paying no attention to the\r\ncaptain\xe2\x80\x99s latter remark. \xe2\x80\x9cIf so I can tell you what we quarrelled about\r\nas we walk along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94that was her destination, depend upon it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThomasin here broke in, still weeping: \xe2\x80\x9cHe said he was only going on a\r\nsudden short journey; but if so why did he want so much money? O, Clym,\r\nwhat do you think will happen? I am afraid that you, my poor baby, will\r\nsoon have no father left to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am off now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yeobright, stepping into the porch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would fain go with \xe2\x80\x99ee,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man doubtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I begin\r\nto be afraid that my legs will hardly carry me there such a night as\r\nthis. I am not so young as I was. If they are interrupted in their\r\nflight she will be sure to come back to me, and I ought to be at the\r\nhouse to receive her. But be it as \xe2\x80\x99twill I can\xe2\x80\x99t walk to the Quiet\r\nWoman, and that\xe2\x80\x99s an end on\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go straight home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will perhaps be best,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym. \xe2\x80\x9cThomasin, dry yourself, and be\r\nas comfortable as you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this he closed the door upon her, and left the house in company\r\nwith Captain Vye, who parted from him outside the gate, taking the\r\nmiddle path, which led to Mistover. Clym crossed by the right-hand\r\ntrack towards the inn.\r\n\r\nThomasin, being left alone, took off some of her wet garments, carried\r\nthe baby upstairs to Clym\xe2\x80\x99s bed, and then came down to the sitting-room\r\nagain, where she made a larger fire, and began drying herself. The fire\r\nsoon flared up the chimney, giving the room an appearance of comfort\r\nthat was doubled by contrast with the drumming of the storm without,\r\nwhich snapped at the windowpanes and breathed into the chimney strange\r\nlow utterances that seemed to be the prologue to some tragedy.\r\n\r\nBut the least part of Thomasin was in the house, for her heart being at\r\nease about the little girl upstairs she was mentally following Clym on\r\nhis journey. Having indulged in this imaginary peregrination for some\r\nconsiderable interval, she became impressed with a sense of the\r\nintolerable slowness of time. But she sat on. The moment then came when\r\nshe could scarcely sit longer, and it was like a satire on her patience\r\nto remember that Clym could hardly have reached the inn as yet. At last\r\nshe went to the baby\xe2\x80\x99s bedside. The child was sleeping soundly; but her\r\nimagination of possibly disastrous events at her home, the predominance\r\nwithin her of the unseen over the seen, agitated her beyond endurance.\r\nShe could not refrain from going down and opening the door. The rain\r\nstill continued, the candlelight falling upon the nearest drops and\r\nmaking glistening darts of them as they descended across the throng of\r\ninvisible ones behind. To plunge into that medium was to plunge into\r\nwater slightly diluted with air. But the difficulty of returning to her\r\nhouse at this moment made her all the more desirous of doing\r\nso\xe2\x80\x94anything was better than suspense. \xe2\x80\x9cI have come here well enough,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said, \xe2\x80\x9cand why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I go back again? It is a mistake for me to\r\nbe away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hastily fetched the infant, wrapped it up, cloaked herself as\r\nbefore, and shoveling the ashes over the fire, to prevent accidents,\r\nwent into the open air. Pausing first to put the door key in its old\r\nplace behind the shutter, she resolutely turned her face to the\r\nconfronting pile of firmamental darkness beyond the palings, and\r\nstepped into its midst. But Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s imagination being so actively\r\nengaged elsewhere, the night and the weather had for her no terror\r\nbeyond that of their actual discomfort and difficulty.\r\n\r\nShe was soon ascending Blooms-End valley and traversing the undulations\r\non the side of the hill. The noise of the wind over the heath was\r\nshrill, and as if it whistled for joy at finding a night so congenial\r\nas this. Sometimes the path led her to hollows between thickets of tall\r\nand dripping bracken, dead, though not yet prostrate, which enclosed\r\nher like a pool. When they were more than usually tall she lifted the\r\nbaby to the top of her head, that it might be out of the reach of their\r\ndrenching fronds. On higher ground, where the wind was brisk and\r\nsustained, the rain flew in a level flight without sensible descent, so\r\nthat it was beyond all power to imagine the remoteness of the point at\r\nwhich it left the bosoms of the clouds. Here self-defence was\r\nimpossible, and individual drops stuck into her like the arrows into\r\nSaint Sebastian. She was enabled to avoid puddles by the nebulous\r\npaleness which signified their presence, though beside anything less\r\ndark than the heath they themselves would have appeared as blackness.\r\n\r\nYet in spite of all this Thomasin was not sorry that she had started.\r\nTo her there were not, as to Eustacia, demons in the air, and malice in\r\nevery bush and bough. The drops which lashed her face were not\r\nscorpions, but prosy rain; Egdon in the mass was no monster whatever,\r\nbut impersonal open ground. Her fears of the place were rational, her\r\ndislikes of its worst moods reasonable. At this time it was in her view\r\na windy, wet place, in which a person might experience much discomfort,\r\nlose the path without care, and possibly catch cold.\r\n\r\nIf the path is well known the difficulty at such times of keeping\r\ntherein is not altogether great, from its familiar feel to the feet;\r\nbut once lost it is irrecoverable. Owing to her baby, who somewhat\r\nimpeded Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s view forward and distracted her mind, she did at\r\nlast lose the track. This mishap occurred when she was descending an\r\nopen slope about two-thirds home. Instead of attempting, by wandering\r\nhither and thither, the hopeless task of finding such a mere thread,\r\nshe went straight on, trusting for guidance to her general knowledge of\r\nthe contours, which was scarcely surpassed by Clym\xe2\x80\x99s or by that of the\r\nheath-croppers themselves.\r\n\r\nAt length Thomasin reached a hollow and began to discern through the\r\nrain a faint blotted radiance, which presently assumed the oblong form\r\nof an open door. She knew that no house stood hereabouts, and was soon\r\naware of the nature of the door by its height above the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it is Diggory Venn\xe2\x80\x99s van, surely!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nA certain secluded spot near Rainbarrow was, she knew, often Venn\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchosen centre when staying in this neighbourhood; and she guessed at\r\nonce that she had stumbled upon this mysterious retreat. The question\r\narose in her mind whether or not she should ask him to guide her into\r\nthe path. In her anxiety to reach home she decided that she would\r\nappeal to him, notwithstanding the strangeness of appearing before his\r\neyes at this place and season. But when, in pursuance of this resolve,\r\nThomasin reached the van and looked in she found it to be untenanted;\r\nthough there was no doubt that it was the reddleman\xe2\x80\x99s. The fire was\r\nburning in the stove, the lantern hung from the nail. Round the doorway\r\nthe floor was merely sprinkled with rain, and not saturated, which told\r\nher that the door had not long been opened.\r\n\r\nWhile she stood uncertainly looking in Thomasin heard a footstep\r\nadvancing from the darkness behind her, and turning, beheld the\r\nwell-known form in corduroy, lurid from head to foot, the lantern beams\r\nfalling upon him through an intervening gauze of raindrops.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you went down the slope,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, without noticing her\r\nface. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you come back here again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiggory?\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomasin faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn, still unperceiving. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd why were you crying\r\nso just now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Diggory! don\xe2\x80\x99t you know me?\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cBut of course you don\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nwrapped up like this. What do you mean? I have not been crying here,\r\nand I have not been here before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVenn then came nearer till he could see the illuminated side of her\r\nform.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Wildeve!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, starting. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a time for us to meet!\r\nAnd the baby too! What dreadful thing can have brought you out on such\r\na night as this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could not immediately answer; and without asking her permission he\r\nhopped into his van, took her by the arm, and drew her up after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued when they stood within.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have lost my way coming from Blooms-End, and I am in a great hurry\r\nto get home. Please show me as quickly as you can! It is so silly of me\r\nnot to know Egdon better, and I cannot think how I came to lose the\r\npath. Show me quickly, Diggory, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course. I will go with \xe2\x80\x99ee. But you came to me before this,\r\nMrs. Wildeve?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only came this minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s strange. I was lying down here asleep about five minutes ago,\r\nwith the door shut to keep out the weather, when the brushing of a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s clothes over the heath-bushes just outside woke me up, for I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t sleep heavy, and at the same time I heard a sobbing or crying\r\nfrom the same woman. I opened my door and held out my lantern, and just\r\nas far as the light would reach I saw a woman; she turned her head when\r\nthe light sheened on her, and then hurried on downhill. I hung up the\r\nlantern, and was curious enough to pull on my things and dog her a few\r\nsteps, but I could see nothing of her any more. That was where I had\r\nbeen when you came up; and when I saw you I thought you were the same\r\none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it was one of the heathfolk going home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be. \xe2\x80\x99Tis too late. The noise of her gown over the\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99th was of a whistling sort that nothing but silk will make.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I, then. My dress is not silk, you see.... Are we anywhere\r\nin a line between Mistover and the inn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes; not far out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I wonder if it was she! Diggory, I must go at once!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe jumped down from the van before he was aware, when Venn unhooked\r\nthe lantern and leaped down after her. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take the baby, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must be tired out by the weight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThomasin hesitated a moment, and then delivered the baby into Venn\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t squeeze her, Diggory,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cor hurt her little arm;\r\nand keep the cloak close over her like this, so that the rain may not\r\ndrop in her face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cAs if I could hurt anything belonging\r\nto you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only meant accidentally,\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomasin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe baby is dry enough, but you are pretty wet,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reddleman\r\nwhen, in closing the door of his cart to padlock it, he noticed on the\r\nfloor a ring of water drops where her cloak had hung from her.\r\n\r\nThomasin followed him as he wound right and left to avoid the larger\r\nbushes, stopping occasionally and covering the lantern, while he looked\r\nover his shoulder to gain some idea of the position of Rainbarrow above\r\nthem, which it was necessary to keep directly behind their backs to\r\npreserve a proper course.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are sure the rain does not fall upon baby?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite sure. May I ask how old he is, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe!\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomasin reproachfully. \xe2\x80\x9cAnybody can see better than that in\r\na moment. She is nearly two months old. How far is it now to the inn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little over a quarter of a mile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you walk a little faster?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid you could not keep up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very anxious to get there. Ah, there is a light from the window!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis not from the window. That\xe2\x80\x99s a gig-lamp, to the best of my\r\nbelief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO!\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomasin in despair. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had been there sooner\xe2\x80\x94give me\r\nthe baby, Diggory\xe2\x80\x94you can go back now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go all the way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a quag between us and\r\nthat light, and you will walk into it up to your neck unless I take you\r\nround.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the light is at the inn, and there is no quag in front of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, the light is below the inn some two or three hundred yards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomasin hurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cGo towards the light, and not\r\ntowards the inn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Venn, swerving round in obedience; and, after a pause,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would tell me what this great trouble is. I think you have\r\nproved that I can be trusted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are some things that cannot be\xe2\x80\x94cannot be told to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d And then her\r\nheart rose into her throat, and she could say no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\nSights and Sounds Draw the Wanderers Together\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving seen Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s signal from the hill at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Wildeve\r\nimmediately prepared to assist her in her flight, and, as he hoped,\r\naccompany her. He was somewhat perturbed, and his manner of informing\r\nThomasin that he was going on a journey was in itself sufficient to\r\nrouse her suspicions. When she had gone to bed he collected the few\r\narticles he would require, and went upstairs to the money-chest, whence\r\nhe took a tolerably bountiful sum in notes, which had been advanced to\r\nhim on the property he was so soon to have in possession, to defray\r\nexpenses incidental to the removal.\r\n\r\nHe then went to the stable and coach-house to assure himself that the\r\nhorse, gig, and harness were in a fit condition for a long drive.\r\nNearly half an hour was spent thus, and on returning to the house\r\nWildeve had no thought of Thomasin being anywhere but in bed. He had\r\ntold the stable lad not to stay up, leading the boy to understand that\r\nhis departure would be at three or four in the morning; for this,\r\nthough an exceptional hour, was less strange than midnight, the time\r\nactually agreed on, the packet from Budmouth sailing between one and\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nAt last all was quiet, and he had nothing to do but to wait. By no\r\neffort could he shake off the oppression of spirits which he had\r\nexperienced ever since his last meeting with Eustacia, but he hoped\r\nthere was that in his situation which money could cure. He had\r\npersuaded himself that to act not ungenerously towards his gentle wife\r\nby settling on her the half of his property, and with chivalrous\r\ndevotion towards another and greater woman by sharing her fate, was\r\npossible. And though he meant to adhere to Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s instructions to\r\nthe letter, to deposit her where she wished and to leave her, should\r\nthat be her will, the spell that she had cast over him intensified, and\r\nhis heart was beating fast in the anticipated futility of such commands\r\nin the face of a mutual wish that they should throw in their lot\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nHe would not allow himself to dwell long upon these conjectures,\r\nmaxims, and hopes, and at twenty minutes to twelve he again went softly\r\nto the stable, harnessed the horse, and lit the lamps; whence, taking\r\nthe horse by the head, he led him with the covered car out of the yard\r\nto a spot by the roadside some quarter of a mile below the inn.\r\n\r\nHere Wildeve waited, slightly sheltered from the driving rain by a high\r\nbank that had been cast up at this place. Along the surface of the road\r\nwhere lit by the lamps the loosened gravel and small stones scudded and\r\nclicked together before the wind, which, leaving them in heaps, plunged\r\ninto the heath and boomed across the bushes into darkness. Only one\r\nsound rose above this din of weather, and that was the roaring of a\r\nten-hatch weir to the southward, from a river in the meads which formed\r\nthe boundary of the heath in this direction.\r\n\r\nHe lingered on in perfect stillness till he began to fancy that the\r\nmidnight hour must have struck. A very strong doubt had arisen in his\r\nmind if Eustacia would venture down the hill in such weather; yet\r\nknowing her nature he felt that she might. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor thing! \xe2\x80\x99tis like her\r\nill-luck,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\nAt length he turned to the lamp and looked at his watch. To his\r\nsurprise it was nearly a quarter past midnight. He now wished that he\r\nhad driven up the circuitous road to Mistover, a plan not adopted\r\nbecause of the enormous length of the route in proportion to that of\r\nthe pedestrian\xe2\x80\x99s path down the open hillside, and the consequent\r\nincrease of labour for the horse.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a footstep approached; but the light of the lamps being\r\nin a different direction the comer was not visible. The step paused,\r\nthen came on again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEustacia?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve.\r\n\r\nThe person came forward, and the light fell upon the form of Clym,\r\nglistening with wet, whom Wildeve immediately recognized; but Wildeve,\r\nwho stood behind the lamp, was not at once recognized by Yeobright.\r\n\r\nHe stopped as if in doubt whether this waiting vehicle could have\r\nanything to do with the flight of his wife or not. The sight of\r\nYeobright at once banished Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s sober feelings, who saw him again\r\nas the deadly rival from whom Eustacia was to be kept at all hazards.\r\nHence Wildeve did not speak, in the hope that Clym would pass by\r\nwithout particular inquiry.\r\n\r\nWhile they both hung thus in hesitation a dull sound became audible\r\nabove the storm and wind. Its origin was unmistakable\xe2\x80\x94it was the fall\r\nof a body into the stream in the adjoining mead, apparently at a point\r\nnear the weir.\r\n\r\nBoth started. \xe2\x80\x9cGood God! can it be she?\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should it be she?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildeve, in his alarm forgetting that he\r\nhad hitherto screened himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s you, you traitor, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Yeobright. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should it\r\nbe she? Because last week she would have put an end to her life if she\r\nhad been able. She ought to have been watched! Take one of the lamps\r\nand come with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYeobright seized the one on his side and hastened on; Wildeve did not\r\nwait to unfasten the other, but followed at once along the meadow track\r\nto the weir, a little in the rear of Clym.\r\n\r\nShadwater Weir had at its foot a large circular pool, fifty feet in\r\ndiameter, into which the water flowed through ten huge hatches, raised\r\nand lowered by a winch and cogs in the ordinary manner. The sides of\r\nthe pool were of masonry, to prevent the water from washing away the\r\nbank; but the force of the stream in winter was sometimes such as to\r\nundermine the retaining wall and precipitate it into the hole. Clym\r\nreached the hatches, the framework of which was shaken to its\r\nfoundations by the velocity of the current. Nothing but the froth of\r\nthe waves could be discerned in the pool below. He got upon the plank\r\nbridge over the race, and holding to the rail, that the wind might not\r\nblow him off, crossed to the other side of the river. There he leant\r\nover the wall and lowered the lamp, only to behold the vortex formed at\r\nthe curl of the returning current.\r\n\r\nWildeve meanwhile had arrived on the former side, and the light from\r\nYeobright\xe2\x80\x99s lamp shed a flecked and agitated radiance across the weir\r\npool, revealing to the ex-engineer the tumbling courses of the currents\r\nfrom the hatches above. Across this gashed and puckered mirror a dark\r\nbody was slowly borne by one of the backward currents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, my darling!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Wildeve in an agonized voice; and, without\r\nshowing sufficient presence of mind even to throw off his greatcoat, he\r\nleaped into the boiling caldron.\r\n\r\nYeobright could now also discern the floating body, though but\r\nindistinctly; and imagining from Wildeve\xe2\x80\x99s plunge that there was life\r\nto be saved he was about to leap after. Bethinking himself of a wiser\r\nplan, he placed the lamp against a post to make it stand upright, and\r\nrunning round to the lower part of the pool, where there was no wall,\r\nhe sprang in and boldly waded upwards towards the deeper portion. Here\r\nhe was taken off his legs, and in swimming was carried round into the\r\ncentre of the basin, where he perceived Wildeve struggling.\r\n\r\nWhile these hasty actions were in progress here, Venn and Thomasin had\r\nbeen toiling through the lower corner of the heath in the direction of\r\nthe light. They had not been near enough to the river to hear the\r\nplunge, but they saw the removal of the carriage lamp, and watched its\r\nmotion into the mead. As soon as they reached the car and horse Venn\r\nguessed that something new was amiss, and hastened to follow in the\r\ncourse of the moving light. Venn walked faster than Thomasin, and came\r\nto the weir alone.\r\n\r\nThe lamp placed against the post by Clym still shone across the water,\r\nand the reddleman observed something floating motionless. Being\r\nencumbered with the infant, he ran back to meet Thomasin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake the baby, please, Mrs. Wildeve,\xe2\x80\x9d he said hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cRun home with\r\nher, call the stable lad, and make him send down to me any men who may\r\nbe living near. Somebody has fallen into the weir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThomasin took the child and ran. When she came to the covered car the\r\nhorse, though fresh from the stable, was standing perfectly still, as\r\nif conscious of misfortune. She saw for the first time whose it was.\r\nShe nearly fainted, and would have been unable to proceed another step\r\nbut that the necessity of preserving the little girl from harm nerved\r\nher to an amazing self-control. In this agony of suspense she entered\r\nthe house, put the baby in a place of safety, woke the lad and the\r\nfemale domestic, and ran out to give the alarm at the nearest cottage.\r\n\r\nDiggory, having returned to the brink of the pool, observed that the\r\nsmall upper hatches or floats were withdrawn. He found one of these\r\nlying upon the grass, and taking it under one arm, and with his lantern\r\nin his hand, entered at the bottom of the pool as Clym had done. As\r\nsoon as he began to be in deep water he flung himself across the hatch;\r\nthus supported he was able to keep afloat as long as he chose, holding\r\nthe lantern aloft with his disengaged hand. Propelled by his feet, he\r\nsteered round and round the pool, ascending each time by one of the\r\nback streams and descending in the middle of the current.\r\n\r\nAt first he could see nothing. Then amidst the glistening of the\r\nwhirlpools and the white clots of foam he distinguished a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbonnet floating alone. His search was now under the left wall, when\r\nsomething came to the surface almost close beside him. It was not, as\r\nhe had expected, a woman, but a man. The reddleman put the ring of the\r\nlantern between his teeth, seized the floating man by the collar, and,\r\nholding on to the hatch with his remaining arm, struck out into the\r\nstrongest race, by which the unconscious man, the hatch, and himself\r\nwere carried down the stream. As soon as Venn found his feet dragging\r\nover the pebbles of the shallower part below he secured his footing and\r\nwaded towards the brink. There, where the water stood at about the\r\nheight of his waist, he flung away the hatch, and attempted to drag\r\nforth the man. This was a matter of great difficulty, and he found as\r\nthe reason that the legs of the unfortunate stranger were tightly\r\nembraced by the arms of another man, who had hitherto been entirely\r\nbeneath the surface.\r\n\r\nAt this moment his heart bounded to hear footsteps running towards him,\r\nand two men, roused by Thomasin, appeared at the brink above. They ran\r\nto where Venn was, and helped him in lifting out the apparently drowned\r\npersons, separating them, and laying them out upon the grass. Venn\r\nturned the light upon their faces. The one who had been uppermost was\r\nYeobright; he who had been completely submerged was Wildeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we must search the hole again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn. \xe2\x80\x9cA woman is in there\r\nsomewhere. Get a pole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the men went to the footbridge and tore off the handrail. The\r\nreddleman and the two others then entered the water together from below\r\nas before, and with their united force probed the pool forwards to\r\nwhere it sloped down to its central depth. Venn was not mistaken in\r\nsupposing that any person who had sunk for the last time would be\r\nwashed down to this point, for when they had examined to about halfway\r\nacross something impeded their thrust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPull it forward,\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn, and they raked it in with the pole till\r\nit was close to their feet.\r\n\r\nVenn vanished under the stream, and came up with an armful of wet\r\ndrapery enclosing a woman\xe2\x80\x99s cold form, which was all that remained of\r\nthe desperate Eustacia.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the bank there stood Thomasin, in a stress of grief,\r\nbending over the two unconscious ones who already lay there. The horse\r\nand cart were brought to the nearest point in the road, and it was the\r\nwork of a few minutes only to place the three in the vehicle. Venn led\r\non the horse, supporting Thomasin upon his arm, and the two men\r\nfollowed, till they reached the inn.\r\n\r\nThe woman who had been shaken out of her sleep by Thomasin had hastily\r\ndressed herself and lighted a fire, the other servant being left to\r\nsnore on in peace at the back of the house. The insensible forms of\r\nEustacia, Clym, and Wildeve were then brought in and laid on the\r\ncarpet, with their feet to the fire, when such restorative processes as\r\ncould be thought of were adopted at once, the stableman being in the\r\nmeantime sent for a doctor. But there seemed to be not a whiff of life\r\nin either of the bodies. Then Thomasin, whose stupor of grief had been\r\nthrust off awhile by frantic action, applied a bottle of hartshorn to\r\nClym\xe2\x80\x99s nostrils, having tried it in vain upon the other two. He sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClym\xe2\x80\x99s alive!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nHe soon breathed distinctly, and again and again did she attempt to\r\nrevive her husband by the same means; but Wildeve gave no sign. There\r\nwas too much reason to think that he and Eustacia both were for ever\r\nbeyond the reach of stimulating perfumes. Their exertions did not relax\r\ntill the doctor arrived, when one by one, the senseless three were\r\ntaken upstairs and put into warm beds.\r\n\r\nVenn soon felt himself relieved from further attendance, and went to\r\nthe door, scarcely able yet to realize the strange catastrophe that had\r\nbefallen the family in which he took so great an interest. Thomasin\r\nsurely would be broken down by the sudden and overwhelming nature of\r\nthis event. No firm and sensible Mrs. Yeobright lived now to support\r\nthe gentle girl through the ordeal; and, whatever an unimpassioned\r\nspectator might think of her loss of such a husband as Wildeve, there\r\ncould be no doubt that for the moment she was distracted and horrified\r\nby the blow. As for himself, not being privileged to go to her and\r\ncomfort her, he saw no reason for waiting longer in a house where he\r\nremained only as a stranger.\r\n\r\nHe returned across the heath to his van. The fire was not yet out, and\r\neverything remained as he had left it. Venn now bethought himself of\r\nhis clothes, which were saturated with water to the weight of lead. He\r\nchanged them, spread them before the fire, and lay down to sleep. But\r\nit was more than he could do to rest here while excited by a vivid\r\nimagination of the turmoil they were in at the house he had quitted,\r\nand, blaming himself for coming away, he dressed in another suit,\r\nlocked up the door, and again hastened across to the inn. Rain was\r\nstill falling heavily when he entered the kitchen. A bright fire was\r\nshining from the hearth, and two women were bustling about, one of whom\r\nwas Olly Dowden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how is it going on now?\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Yeobright is better; but Mrs. Yeobright and Mr. Wildeve are dead\r\nand cold. The doctor says they were quite gone before they were out of\r\nthe water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I thought as much when I hauled \xe2\x80\x99em up. And Mrs. Wildeve?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is as well as can be expected. The doctor had her put between\r\nblankets, for she was almost as wet as they that had been in the river,\r\npoor young thing. You don\xe2\x80\x99t seem very dry, reddleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, \xe2\x80\x99tis not much. I have changed my things. This is only a little\r\ndampness I\xe2\x80\x99ve got coming through the rain again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand by the fire. Mis\xe2\x80\x99ess says you be to have whatever you want, and\r\nshe was sorry when she was told that you\xe2\x80\x99d gone away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVenn drew near to the fireplace, and looked into the flames in an\r\nabsent mood. The steam came from his leggings and ascended the chimney\r\nwith the smoke, while he thought of those who were upstairs. Two were\r\ncorpses, one had barely escaped the jaws of death, another was sick and\r\na widow. The last occasion on which he had lingered by that fireplace\r\nwas when the raffle was in progress; when Wildeve was alive and well;\r\nThomasin active and smiling in the next room; Yeobright and Eustacia\r\njust made husband and wife, and Mrs. Yeobright living at Blooms-End. It\r\nhad seemed at that time that the then position of affairs was good for\r\nat least twenty years to come. Yet, of all the circle, he himself was\r\nthe only one whose situation had not materially changed.\r\n\r\nWhile he ruminated a footstep descended the stairs. It was the nurse,\r\nwho brought in her hand a rolled mass of wet paper. The woman was so\r\nengrossed with her occupation that she hardly saw Venn. She took from a\r\ncupboard some pieces of twine, which she strained across the fireplace,\r\ntying the end of each piece to the firedog, previously pulled forward\r\nfor the purpose, and, unrolling the wet papers, she began pinning them\r\none by one to the strings in a manner of clothes on a line.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat be they?\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor master\xe2\x80\x99s banknotes,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were found in his pocket\r\nwhen they undressed him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he was not coming back again for some time?\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat we shall never know,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\nVenn was loth to depart, for all on earth that interested him lay under\r\nthis roof. As nobody in the house had any more sleep that night, except\r\nthe two who slept for ever, there was no reason why he should not\r\nremain. So he retired into the niche of the fireplace where he had used\r\nto sit, and there he continued, watching the steam from the double row\r\nof banknotes as they waved backwards and forwards in the draught of the\r\nchimney till their flaccidity was changed to dry crispness throughout.\r\nThen the woman came and unpinned them, and, folding them together,\r\ncarried the handful upstairs. Presently the doctor appeared from above\r\nwith the look of a man who could do no more, and, pulling on his\r\ngloves, went out of the house, the trotting of his horse soon dying\r\naway upon the road.\r\n\r\nAt four o\xe2\x80\x99clock there was a gentle knock at the door. It was from\r\nCharley, who had been sent by Captain Vye to inquire if anything had\r\nbeen heard of Eustacia. The girl who admitted him looked in his face as\r\nif she did not know what answer to return, and showed him in to where\r\nVenn was seated, saying to the reddleman, \xe2\x80\x9cWill you tell him, please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVenn told. Charley\xe2\x80\x99s only utterance was a feeble, indistinct sound. He\r\nstood quite still; then he burst out spasmodically, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall see her\r\nonce more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say you may see her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diggory gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cBut hadn\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nbetter run and tell Captain Vye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. Only I do hope I shall see her just once again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall,\xe2\x80\x9d said a low voice behind; and starting round they beheld by\r\nthe dim light, a thin, pallid, almost spectral form, wrapped in a\r\nblanket, and looking like Lazarus coming from the tomb.\r\n\r\nIt was Yeobright. Neither Venn nor Charley spoke, and Clym continued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall see her. There will be time enough to tell the captain when\r\nit gets daylight. You would like to see her too\xe2\x80\x94would you not, Diggory?\r\nShe looks very beautiful now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVenn assented by rising to his feet, and with Charley he followed Clym\r\nto the foot of the staircase, where he took off his boots; Charley did\r\nthe same. They followed Yeobright upstairs to the landing, where there\r\nwas a candle burning, which Yeobright took in his hand, and with it led\r\nthe way into an adjoining room. Here he went to the bedside and folded\r\nback the sheet.\r\n\r\nThey stood silently looking upon Eustacia, who, as she lay there still\r\nin death, eclipsed all her living phases. Pallor did not include all\r\nthe quality of her complexion, which seemed more than whiteness; it was\r\nalmost light. The expression of her finely carved mouth was pleasant,\r\nas if a sense of dignity had just compelled her to leave off speaking.\r\nEternal rigidity had seized upon it in a momentary transition between\r\nfervour and resignation. Her black hair was looser now than either of\r\nthem had ever seen it before, and surrounded her brow like a forest.\r\nThe stateliness of look which had been almost too marked for a dweller\r\nin a country domicile had at last found an artistically happy\r\nbackground.\r\n\r\nNobody spoke, till at length Clym covered her and turned aside. \xe2\x80\x9cNow\r\ncome here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThey went to a recess in the same room, and there, on a smaller bed,\r\nlay another figure\xe2\x80\x94Wildeve. Less repose was visible in his face than in\r\nEustacia\xe2\x80\x99s, but the same luminous youthfulness overspread it, and the\r\nleast sympathetic observer would have felt at sight of him now that he\r\nwas born for a higher destiny than this. The only sign upon him of his\r\nrecent struggle for life was in his fingertips, which were worn and\r\nsacrificed in his dying endeavours to obtain a hold on the face of the\r\nweir-wall.\r\n\r\nYeobright\xe2\x80\x99s manner had been so quiet, he had uttered so few syllables\r\nsince his reappearance, that Venn imagined him resigned. It was only\r\nwhen they had left the room and stood upon the landing that the true\r\nstate of his mind was apparent. Here he said, with a wild smile,\r\ninclining his head towards the chamber in which Eustacia lay, \xe2\x80\x9cShe is\r\nthe second woman I have killed this year. I was a great cause of my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s death, and I am the chief cause of hers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI spoke cruel words to her, and she left my house. I did not invite\r\nher back till it was too late. It is I who ought to have drowned\r\nmyself. It would have been a charity to the living had the river\r\noverwhelmed me and borne her up. But I cannot die. Those who ought to\r\nhave lived lie dead; and here am I alive!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can\xe2\x80\x99t charge yourself with crimes in that way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may as well say that the parents be the cause of a murder by the\r\nchild, for without the parents the child would never have been begot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Venn, that is very true; but you don\xe2\x80\x99t know all the\r\ncircumstances. If it had pleased God to put an end to me it would have\r\nbeen a good thing for all. But I am getting used to the horror of my\r\nexistence. They say that a time comes when men laugh at misery through\r\nlong acquaintance with it. Surely that time will soon come to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour aim has always been good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you say such\r\ndesperate things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they are not desperate. They are only hopeless; and my great\r\nregret is that for what I have done no man or law can punish me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK SIXTH\xe2\x80\x94AFTERCOURSES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\nThe Inevitable Movement Onward\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story of the deaths of Eustacia and Wildeve was told throughout\r\nEgdon, and far beyond, for many weeks and months. All the known\r\nincidents of their love were enlarged, distorted, touched up, and\r\nmodified, till the original reality bore but a slight resemblance to\r\nthe counterfeit presentation by surrounding tongues. Yet, upon the\r\nwhole, neither the man nor the woman lost dignity by sudden death.\r\nMisfortune had struck them gracefully, cutting off their erratic\r\nhistories with a catastrophic dash, instead of, as with many,\r\nattenuating each life to an uninteresting meagreness, through long\r\nyears of wrinkles, neglect, and decay.\r\n\r\nOn those most nearly concerned the effect was somewhat different.\r\nStrangers who had heard of many such cases now merely heard of one\r\nmore; but immediately where a blow falls no previous imaginings amount\r\nto appreciable preparation for it. The very suddenness of her\r\nbereavement dulled, to some extent, Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s feelings; yet\r\nirrationally enough, a consciousness that the husband she had lost\r\nought to have been a better man did not lessen her mourning at all. On\r\nthe contrary, this fact seemed at first to set off the dead husband in\r\nhis young wife\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and to be the necessary cloud to the rainbow.\r\n\r\nBut the horrors of the unknown had passed. Vague misgivings about her\r\nfuture as a deserted wife were at an end. The worst had once been\r\nmatter of trembling conjecture; it was now matter of reason only, a\r\nlimited badness. Her chief interest, the little Eustacia, still\r\nremained. There was humility in her grief, no defiance in her attitude;\r\nand when this is the case a shaken spirit is apt to be stilled.\r\n\r\nCould Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s mournfulness now and Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s serenity during life\r\nhave been reduced to common measure, they would have touched the same\r\nmark nearly. But Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s former brightness made shadow of that which\r\nin a sombre atmosphere was light itself.\r\n\r\nThe spring came and calmed her; the summer came and soothed her; the\r\nautumn arrived, and she began to be comforted, for her little girl was\r\nstrong and happy, growing in size and knowledge every day. Outward\r\nevents flattered Thomasin not a little. Wildeve had died intestate, and\r\nshe and the child were his only relatives. When administration had been\r\ngranted, all the debts paid, and the residue of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproperty had come into her hands, it was found that the sum waiting to\r\nbe invested for her own and the child\xe2\x80\x99s benefit was little less than\r\nten thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nWhere should she live? The obvious place was Blooms-End. The old rooms,\r\nit is true, were not much higher than the between-decks of a frigate,\r\nnecessitating a sinking in the floor under the new clock-case she\r\nbrought from the inn, and the removal of the handsome brass knobs on\r\nits head, before there was height for it to stand; but, such as the\r\nrooms were, there were plenty of them, and the place was endeared to\r\nher by every early recollection. Clym very gladly admitted her as a\r\ntenant, confining his own existence to two rooms at the top of the back\r\nstaircase, where he lived on quietly, shut off from Thomasin and the\r\nthree servants she had thought fit to indulge in now that she was a\r\nmistress of money, going his own ways, and thinking his own thoughts.\r\n\r\nHis sorrows had made some change in his outward appearance; and yet the\r\nalteration was chiefly within. It might have been said that he had a\r\nwrinkled mind. He had no enemies, and he could get nobody to reproach\r\nhim, which was why he so bitterly reproached himself.\r\n\r\nHe did sometimes think he had been ill-used by fortune, so far as to\r\nsay that to be born is a palpable dilemma, and that instead of men\r\naiming to advance in life with glory they should calculate how to\r\nretreat out of it without shame. But that he and his had been\r\nsarcastically and pitilessly handled in having such irons thrust into\r\ntheir souls he did not maintain long. It is usually so, except with the\r\nsternest of men. Human beings, in their generous endeavour to construct\r\na hypothesis that shall not degrade a First Cause, have always\r\nhesitated to conceive a dominant power of lower moral quality than\r\ntheir own; and, even while they sit down and weep by the waters of\r\nBabylon, invent excuses for the oppression which prompts their tears.\r\n\r\nThus, though words of solace were vainly uttered in his presence, he\r\nfound relief in a direction of his own choosing when left to himself.\r\nFor a man of his habits the house and the hundred and twenty pounds a\r\nyear which he had inherited from his mother were enough to supply all\r\nworldly needs. Resources do not depend upon gross amounts, but upon the\r\nproportion of spendings to takings.\r\n\r\nHe frequently walked the heath alone, when the past seized upon him\r\nwith its shadowy hand, and held him there to listen to its tale. His\r\nimagination would then people the spot with its ancient\r\ninhabitants\xe2\x80\x94forgotten Celtic tribes trod their tracks about him, and he\r\ncould almost live among them, look in their faces, and see them\r\nstanding beside the barrows which swelled around, untouched and perfect\r\nas at the time of their erection. Those of the dyed barbarians who had\r\nchosen the cultivable tracts were, in comparison with those who had\r\nleft their marks here, as writers on paper beside writers on parchment.\r\nTheir records had perished long ago by the plough, while the works of\r\nthese remained. Yet they all had lived and died unconscious of the\r\ndifferent fates awaiting their relics. It reminded him that unforeseen\r\nfactors operate in the evolution of immortality.\r\n\r\nWinter again came round, with its winds, frosts, tame robins, and\r\nsparkling starlight. The year previous Thomasin had hardly been\r\nconscious of the season\xe2\x80\x99s advance; this year she laid her heart open to\r\nexternal influences of every kind. The life of this sweet cousin, her\r\nbaby, and her servants, came to Clym\xe2\x80\x99s senses only in the form of\r\nsounds through a wood partition as he sat over books of exceptionally\r\nlarge type; but his ear became at last so accustomed to these slight\r\nnoises from the other part of the house that he almost could witness\r\nthe scenes they signified. A faint beat of half-seconds conjured up\r\nThomasin rocking the cradle, a wavering hum meant that she was singing\r\nthe baby to sleep, a crunching of sand as between millstones raised the\r\npicture of Humphrey\xe2\x80\x99s, Fairway\xe2\x80\x99s, or Sam\xe2\x80\x99s heavy feet crossing the\r\nstone floor of the kitchen; a light boyish step, and a gay tune in a\r\nhigh key, betokened a visit from Grandfer Cantle; a sudden break-off in\r\nthe Grandfer\xe2\x80\x99s utterances implied the application to his lips of a mug\r\nof small beer, a bustling and slamming of doors meant starting to go to\r\nmarket; for Thomasin, in spite of her added scope of gentility, led a\r\nludicrously narrow life, to the end that she might save every possible\r\npound for her little daughter.\r\n\r\nOne summer day Clym was in the garden, immediately outside the parlour\r\nwindow, which was as usual open. He was looking at the pot-flowers on\r\nthe sill; they had been revived and restored by Thomasin to the state\r\nin which his mother had left them. He heard a slight scream from\r\nThomasin, who was sitting inside the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, how you frightened me!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to someone who had entered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthought you were the ghost of yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClym was curious enough to advance a little further and look in at the\r\nwindow. To his astonishment there stood within the room Diggory Venn,\r\nno longer a reddleman, but exhibiting the strangely altered hues of an\r\nordinary Christian countenance, white shirt-front, light flowered\r\nwaistcoat, blue-spotted neckerchief, and bottle-green coat. Nothing in\r\nthis appearance was at all singular but the fact of its great\r\ndifference from what he had formerly been. Red, and all approach to\r\nred, was carefully excluded from every article of clothes upon him; for\r\nwhat is there that persons just out of harness dread so much as\r\nreminders of the trade which has enriched them?\r\n\r\nYeobright went round to the door and entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was so alarmed!\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomasin, smiling from one to the other. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that he had got white of his own accord! It seemed\r\nsupernatural.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gave up dealing in reddle last Christmas,\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a\r\nprofitable trade, and I found that by that time I had made enough to\r\ntake the dairy of fifty cows that my father had in his lifetime. I\r\nalways thought of getting to that place again if I changed at all, and\r\nnow I am there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you manage to become white, Diggory?\xe2\x80\x9d Thomasin asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI turned so by degrees, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look much better than ever you did before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVenn appeared confused; and Thomasin, seeing how inadvertently she had\r\nspoken to a man who might possibly have tender feelings for her still,\r\nblushed a little. Clym saw nothing of this, and added good-humouredly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall we have to frighten Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s baby with, now you have\r\nbecome a human being again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, Diggory,\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomasin, \xe2\x80\x9cand stay to tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVenn moved as if he would retire to the kitchen, when Thomasin said\r\nwith pleasant pertness as she went on with some sewing, \xe2\x80\x9cOf course you\r\nmust sit down here. And where does your fifty-cow dairy lie, Mr. Venn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt Stickleford\xe2\x80\x94about two miles to the right of Alderworth, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\r\nwhere the meads begin. I have thought that if Mr. Yeobright would like\r\nto pay me a visit sometimes he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay away for want of asking.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll not bide to tea this afternoon, thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve got something\r\non hand that must be settled. \xe2\x80\x99Tis Maypole-day tomorrow, and the\r\nShadwater folk have clubbed with a few of your neighbours here to have\r\na pole just outside your palings in the heath, as it is a nice green\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x9d Venn waved his elbow towards the patch in front of the house.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been talking to Fairway about it,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cand I said to\r\nhim that before we put up the pole it would be as well to ask Mrs.\r\nWildeve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can say nothing against it,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cOur property does not\r\nreach an inch further than the white palings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you might not like to see a lot of folk going crazy round a stick,\r\nunder your very nose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have no objection at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVenn soon after went away, and in the evening Yeobright strolled as far\r\nas Fairway\xe2\x80\x99s cottage. It was a lovely May sunset, and the birch trees\r\nwhich grew on this margin of the vast Egdon wilderness had put on their\r\nnew leaves, delicate as butterflies\xe2\x80\x99 wings, and diaphanous as amber.\r\nBeside Fairway\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling was an open space recessed from the road, and\r\nhere were now collected all the young people from within a radius of a\r\ncouple of miles. The pole lay with one end supported on a trestle, and\r\nwomen were engaged in wreathing it from the top downwards with\r\nwild-flowers. The instincts of merry England lingered on here with\r\nexceptional vitality, and the symbolic customs which tradition has\r\nattached to each season of the year were yet a reality on Egdon.\r\nIndeed, the impulses of all such outlandish hamlets are pagan still\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nthese spots homage to nature, self-adoration, frantic gaieties,\r\nfragments of Teutonic rites to divinities whose names are forgotten,\r\nseem in some way or other to have survived medi\xc3\xa6val doctrine.\r\n\r\nYeobright did not interrupt the preparations, and went home again. The\r\nnext morning, when Thomasin withdrew the curtains of her bedroom\r\nwindow, there stood the Maypole in the middle of the green, its top\r\ncutting into the sky. It had sprung up in the night, or rather early\r\nmorning, like Jack\xe2\x80\x99s bean-stalk. She opened the casement to get a\r\nbetter view of the garlands and posies that adorned it. The sweet\r\nperfume of the flowers had already spread into the surrounding air,\r\nwhich, being free from every taint, conducted to her lips a full\r\nmeasure of the fragrance received from the spire of blossom in its\r\nmidst. At the top of the pole were crossed hoops decked with small\r\nflowers; beneath these came a milk-white zone of Maybloom; then a zone\r\nof bluebells, then of cowslips, then of lilacs, then of ragged-robins,\r\ndaffodils, and so on, till the lowest stage was reached. Thomasin\r\nnoticed all these, and was delighted that the May revel was to be so\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nWhen afternoon came people began to gather on the green, and Yeobright\r\nwas interested enough to look out upon them from the open window of his\r\nroom. Soon after this Thomasin walked out from the door immediately\r\nbelow and turned her eyes up to her cousin\xe2\x80\x99s face. She was dressed more\r\ngaily than Yeobright had ever seen her dressed since the time of\r\nWildeve\xe2\x80\x99s death, eighteen months before; since the day of her marriage\r\neven she had not exhibited herself to such advantage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow pretty you look today, Thomasin!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it because of the\r\nMaypole?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d And then she blushed and dropped her eyes, which he\r\ndid not specially observe, though her manner seemed to him to be rather\r\npeculiar, considering that she was only addressing himself. Could it be\r\npossible that she had put on her summer clothes to please him?\r\n\r\nHe recalled her conduct towards him throughout the last few weeks, when\r\nthey had often been working together in the garden, just as they had\r\nformerly done when they were boy and girl under his mother\xe2\x80\x99s eye. What\r\nif her interest in him were not so entirely that of a relative as it\r\nhad formerly been? To Yeobright any possibility of this sort was a\r\nserious matter; and he almost felt troubled at the thought of it. Every\r\npulse of loverlike feeling which had not been stilled during Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlifetime had gone into the grave with her. His passion for her had\r\noccurred too far on in his manhood to leave fuel enough on hand for\r\nanother fire of that sort, as may happen with more boyish loves. Even\r\nsupposing him capable of loving again, that love would be a plant of\r\nslow and laboured growth, and in the end only small and sickly, like an\r\nautumn-hatched bird.\r\n\r\nHe was so distressed by this new complexity that when the enthusiastic\r\nbrass band arrived and struck up, which it did about five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, with\r\napparently wind enough among its members to blow down his house, he\r\nwithdrew from his rooms by the back door, went down the garden, through\r\nthe gate in the hedge, and away out of sight. He could not bear to\r\nremain in the presence of enjoyment today, though he had tried hard.\r\n\r\nNothing was seen of him for four hours. When he came back by the same\r\npath it was dusk, and the dews were coating every green thing. The\r\nboisterous music had ceased; but, entering the premises as he did from\r\nbehind, he could not see if the May party had all gone till he had\r\npassed through Thomasin\xe2\x80\x99s division of the house to the front door.\r\nThomasin was standing within the porch alone.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him reproachfully. \xe2\x80\x9cYou went away just when it began,\r\nClym,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I felt I could not join in. You went out with them, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I did not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou appeared to be dressed on purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I could not go out alone; so many people were there. One is\r\nthere now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYeobright strained his eyes across the dark-green patch beyond the\r\npaling, and near the black form of the Maypole he discerned a shadowy\r\nfigure, sauntering idly up and down. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Venn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomasin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might have asked him to come in, I think, Tamsie. He has been very\r\nkind to you first and last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; and, acting on the impulse, went through the\r\nwicket to where Venn stood under the Maypole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Mr. Venn, I think?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired.\r\n\r\nVenn started as if he had not seen her\xe2\x80\x94artful man that he was\xe2\x80\x94and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you come in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid that I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen you dancing this evening, and you had the very best of the\r\ngirls for your partners. Is it that you won\xe2\x80\x99t come in because you wish\r\nto stand here, and think over the past hours of enjoyment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s partly it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Venn, with ostentatious sentiment.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the main reason why I am biding here like this is that I want to\r\nwait till the moon rises.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo see how pretty the Maypole looks in the moonlight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. To look for a glove that was dropped by one of the maidens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThomasin was speechless with surprise. That a man who had to walk some\r\nfour or five miles to his home should wait here for such a reason\r\npointed to only one conclusion\xe2\x80\x94the man must be amazingly interested in\r\nthat glove\xe2\x80\x99s owner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you dancing with her, Diggory?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, in a voice which\r\nrevealed that he had made himself considerably more interesting to her\r\nby this disclosure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will not come in, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot tonight, thank you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I lend you a lantern to look for the young person\xe2\x80\x99s glove, Mr.\r\nVenn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no; it is not necessary, Mrs. Wildeve, thank you. The moon will rise\r\nin a few minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThomasin went back to the porch. \xe2\x80\x9cIs he coming in?\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym, who had\r\nbeen waiting where she had left him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would rather not tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and then passed by him into\r\nthe house; whereupon Clym too retired to his own rooms.\r\n\r\nWhen Clym was gone Thomasin crept upstairs in the dark, and, just\r\nlistening by the cot, to assure herself that the child was asleep, she\r\nwent to the window, gently lifted the corner of the white curtain, and\r\nlooked out. Venn was still there. She watched the growth of the faint\r\nradiance appearing in the sky by the eastern hill, till presently the\r\nedge of the moon burst upwards and flooded the valley with light.\r\nDiggory\xe2\x80\x99s form was now distinct on the green; he was moving about in a\r\nbowed attitude, evidently scanning the grass for the precious missing\r\narticle, walking in zigzags right and left till he should have passed\r\nover every foot of the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow very ridiculous!\xe2\x80\x9d Thomasin murmured to herself, in a tone which\r\nwas intended to be satirical. \xe2\x80\x9cTo think that a man should be so silly\r\nas to go mooning about like that for a girl\xe2\x80\x99s glove! A respectable\r\ndairyman, too, and a man of money as he is now. What a pity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last Venn appeared to find it; whereupon he stood up and raised it\r\nto his lips. Then placing it in his breastpocket\xe2\x80\x94the nearest receptacle\r\nto a man\xe2\x80\x99s heart permitted by modern raiment\xe2\x80\x94he ascended the valley in\r\na mathematically direct line towards his distant home in the meadows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\nThomasin Walks in a Green Place by the Roman Road\r\n\r\n\r\nClym saw little of Thomasin for several days after this; and when they\r\nmet she was more silent than usual. At length he asked her what she was\r\nthinking of so intently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am thoroughly perplexed,\xe2\x80\x9d she said candidly. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot for my life\r\nthink who it is that Diggory Venn is so much in love with. None of the\r\ngirls at the Maypole were good enough for him, and yet she must have\r\nbeen there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClym tried to imagine Venn\xe2\x80\x99s choice for a moment; but ceasing to be\r\ninterested in the question he went on again with his gardening.\r\n\r\nNo clearing up of the mystery was granted her for some time. But one\r\nafternoon Thomasin was upstairs getting ready for a walk, when she had\r\noccasion to come to the landing and call \xe2\x80\x9cRachel.\xe2\x80\x9d Rachel was a girl\r\nabout thirteen, who carried the baby out for airings; and she came\r\nupstairs at the call.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen one of my last new gloves about the house, Rachel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninquired Thomasin. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the fellow to this one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel did not reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you answer?\xe2\x80\x9d said her mistress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it is lost, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLost? Who lost it? I have never worn them but once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel appeared as one dreadfully troubled, and at last began to cry.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, on the day of the Maypole I had none to wear, and I\r\nseed yours on the table, and I thought I would borrow \xe2\x80\x99em. I did not\r\nmean to hurt \xe2\x80\x99em at all, but one of them got lost. Somebody gave me\r\nsome money to buy another pair for you, but I have not been able to go\r\nanywhere to get \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s somebody?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Venn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he know it was my glove?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I told him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThomasin was so surprised by the explanation that she quite forgot to\r\nlecture the girl, who glided silently away. Thomasin did not move\r\nfurther than to turn her eyes upon the grass-plat where the Maypole had\r\nstood. She remained thinking, then said to herself that she would not\r\ngo out that afternoon, but would work hard at the baby\xe2\x80\x99s unfinished\r\nlovely plaid frock, cut on the cross in the newest fashion. How she\r\nmanaged to work hard, and yet do no more than she had done at the end\r\nof two hours, would have been a mystery to anyone not aware that the\r\nrecent incident was of a kind likely to divert her industry from a\r\nmanual to a mental channel.\r\n\r\nNext day she went her ways as usual, and continued her custom of\r\nwalking in the heath with no other companion than little Eustacia, now\r\nof the age when it is a matter of doubt with such characters whether\r\nthey are intended to walk through the world on their hands or on their\r\nfeet; so that they get into painful complications by trying both. It\r\nwas very pleasant to Thomasin, when she had carried the child to some\r\nlonely place, to give her a little private practice on the green turf\r\nand shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s-thyme, which formed a soft mat to fall headlong upon\r\nthem when equilibrium was lost.\r\n\r\nOnce, when engaged in this system of training, and stooping to remove\r\nbits of stick, fern-stalks, and other such fragments from the child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npath, that the journey might not be brought to an untimely end by some\r\ninsuperable barrier a quarter of an inch high, she was alarmed by\r\ndiscovering that a man on horseback was almost close beside her, the\r\nsoft natural carpet having muffled the horse\xe2\x80\x99s tread. The rider, who\r\nwas Venn, waved his hat in the air and bowed gallantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiggory, give me my glove,\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomasin, whose manner it was under\r\nany circumstances to plunge into the midst of a subject which engrossed\r\nher.\r\n\r\nVenn immediately dismounted, put his hand in his breastpocket, and\r\nhanded the glove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you. It was very good of you to take care of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very good of you to say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no. I was quite glad to find you had it. Everybody gets so\r\nindifferent that I was surprised to know you thought of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had remembered what I was once you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been\r\nsurprised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut men of your character are mostly so\r\nindependent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is my character?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomasin simply, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept it is to cover up\r\nyour feelings under a practical manner, and only to show them when you\r\nare alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, how do you know that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn strategically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, stopping to put the little girl, who had managed\r\nto get herself upside down, right end up again, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t judge by folks in general,\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn. \xe2\x80\x9cStill I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nmuch what feelings are nowadays. I have got so mixed up with business\r\nof one sort and t\xe2\x80\x99other that my soft sentiments are gone off in vapour\r\nlike. Yes, I am given up body and soul to the making of money. Money is\r\nall my dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Diggory, how wicked!\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomasin reproachfully, and looking at\r\nhim in exact balance between taking his words seriously and judging\r\nthem as said to tease her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, \xe2\x80\x99tis rather a rum course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn, in the bland tone of one\r\ncomfortably resigned to sins he could no longer overcome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, who used to be so nice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s an argument I rather like, because what a man has once\r\nbeen he may be again.\xe2\x80\x9d Thomasin blushed. \xe2\x80\x9cExcept that it is rather\r\nharder now,\xe2\x80\x9d Venn continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you be richer than you were at that time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no\xe2\x80\x94not much. I have made it nearly all over to the baby, as it was\r\nmy duty to do, except just enough to live on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am rather glad of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Venn softly, and regarding her from\r\nthe corner of his eye, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it makes it easier for us to be friendly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThomasin blushed again, and, when a few more words had been said of a\r\nnot unpleasing kind, Venn mounted his horse and rode on.\r\n\r\nThis conversation had passed in a hollow of the heath near the old\r\nRoman road, a place much frequented by Thomasin. And it might have been\r\nobserved that she did not in future walk that way less often from\r\nhaving met Venn there now. Whether or not Venn abstained from riding\r\nthither because he had met Thomasin in the same place might easily have\r\nbeen guessed from her proceedings about two months later in the same\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nThe Serious Discourse of Clym with His Cousin\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout this period Yeobright had more or less pondered on his duty\r\nto his cousin Thomasin. He could not help feeling that it would be a\r\npitiful waste of sweet material if the tender-natured thing should be\r\ndoomed from this early stage of her life onwards to dribble away her\r\nwinsome qualities on lonely gorse and fern. But he felt this as an\r\neconomist merely, and not as a lover. His passion for Eustacia had been\r\na sort of conserve of his whole life, and he had nothing more of that\r\nsupreme quality left to bestow. So far the obvious thing was not to\r\nentertain any idea of marriage with Thomasin, even to oblige her.\r\n\r\nBut this was not all. Years ago there had been in his mother\xe2\x80\x99s mind a\r\ngreat fancy about Thomasin and himself. It had not positively amounted\r\nto a desire, but it had always been a favourite dream. That they should\r\nbe man and wife in good time, if the happiness of neither were\r\nendangered thereby, was the fancy in question. So that what course save\r\none was there now left for any son who reverenced his mother\xe2\x80\x99s memory\r\nas Yeobright did? It is an unfortunate fact that any particular whim of\r\nparents, which might have been dispersed by half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s conversation\r\nduring their lives, becomes sublimated by their deaths into a fiat the\r\nmost absolute, with such results to conscientious children as those\r\nparents, had they lived, would have been the first to decry.\r\n\r\nHad only Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s own future been involved he would have proposed to\r\nThomasin with a ready heart. He had nothing to lose by carrying out a\r\ndead mother\xe2\x80\x99s hope. But he dreaded to contemplate Thomasin wedded to\r\nthe mere corpse of a lover that he now felt himself to be. He had but\r\nthree activities alive in him. One was his almost daily walk to the\r\nlittle graveyard wherein his mother lay; another, his just as frequent\r\nvisits by night to the more distant enclosure which numbered his\r\nEustacia among its dead; the third was self-preparation for a vocation\r\nwhich alone seemed likely to satisfy his cravings\xe2\x80\x94that of an itinerant\r\npreacher of the eleventh commandment. It was difficult to believe that\r\nThomasin would be cheered by a husband with such tendencies as these.\r\n\r\nYet he resolved to ask her, and let her decide for herself. It was even\r\nwith a pleasant sense of doing his duty that he went downstairs to her\r\none evening for this purpose, when the sun was printing on the valley\r\nthe same long shadow of the housetop that he had seen lying there times\r\nout of number while his mother lived.\r\n\r\nThomasin was not in her room, and he found her in the front garden. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave long been wanting, Thomasin,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cto say something about a\r\nmatter that concerns both our futures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are going to say it now?\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked quickly, colouring as\r\nshe met his gaze. \xe2\x80\x9cDo stop a minute, Clym, and let me speak first, for\r\noddly enough, I have been wanting to say something to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all means say on, Tamsie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose nobody can overhear us?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, casting her eyes\r\naround and lowering her voice. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, first you will promise me\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94that you won\xe2\x80\x99t be angry and call me anything harsh if you disagree\r\nwith what I propose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYeobright promised, and she continued: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I want is your advice, for\r\nyou are my relation\xe2\x80\x94I mean, a sort of guardian to me\xe2\x80\x94aren\xe2\x80\x99t you, Clym?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes, I suppose I am; a sort of guardian. In fact, I am, of\r\ncourse,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, altogether perplexed as to her drift.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am thinking of marrying,\xe2\x80\x9d she then observed blandly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I shall\r\nnot marry unless you assure me that you approve of such a step. Why\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you speak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was taken rather by surprise. But, nevertheless, I am very glad to\r\nhear such news. I shall approve, of course, dear Tamsie. Who can it be?\r\nI am quite at a loss to guess. No I am not\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis the old doctor!\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nthat I mean to call him old, for he is not very old after all. Ah\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nnoticed when he attended you last time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d she said hastily. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis Mr. Venn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClym\xe2\x80\x99s face suddenly became grave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, now, you don\xe2\x80\x99t like him, and I wish I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t mentioned him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe exclaimed almost petulantly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done it, either,\r\nonly he keeps on bothering me so till I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClym looked at the heath. \xe2\x80\x9cI like Venn well enough,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered at\r\nlast. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a very honest and at the same time astute man. He is\r\nclever too, as is proved by his having got you to favour him. But\r\nreally, Thomasin, he is not quite\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentleman enough for me? That is just what I feel. I am sorry now that\r\nI asked you, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t think any more of him. At the same time I must\r\nmarry him if I marry anybody\xe2\x80\x94that I _will_ say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym, carefully concealing every clue to his\r\nown interrupted intention, which she plainly had not guessed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmight marry a professional man, or somebody of that sort, by going into\r\nthe town to live and forming acquaintances there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not fit for town life\xe2\x80\x94so very rural and silly as I always have\r\nbeen. Do not you yourself notice my countrified ways?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, when I came home from Paris I did, a little; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s because you have got countrified too. O, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t live in a\r\nstreet for the world! Egdon is a ridiculous old place; but I have got\r\nused to it, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be happy anywhere else at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither could I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen how could you say that I should marry some town man? I am sure,\r\nsay what you will, that I must marry Diggory, if I marry at all. He has\r\nbeen kinder to me than anybody else, and has helped me in many ways\r\nthat I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of!\xe2\x80\x9d Thomasin almost pouted now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he has,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym in a neutral tone. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I wish with all my\r\nheart that I could say, marry him. But I cannot forget what my mother\r\nthought on that matter, and it goes rather against me not to respect\r\nher opinion. There is too much reason why we should do the little we\r\ncan to respect it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Thomasin. \xe2\x80\x9cI will say no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are not bound to obey my wishes. I merely say what I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be rebellious in that way,\xe2\x80\x9d she said sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhad no business to think of him\xe2\x80\x94I ought to have thought of my family.\r\nWhat dreadfully bad impulses there are in me!\xe2\x80\x9d Her lips trembled, and\r\nshe turned away to hide a tear.\r\n\r\nClym, though vexed at what seemed her unaccountable taste, was in a\r\nmeasure relieved to find that at any rate the marriage question in\r\nrelation to himself was shelved. Through several succeeding days he saw\r\nher at different times from the window of his room moping\r\ndisconsolately about the garden. He was half angry with her for\r\nchoosing Venn; then he was grieved at having put himself in the way of\r\nVenn\xe2\x80\x99s happiness, who was, after all, as honest and persevering a young\r\nfellow as any on Egdon, since he had turned over a new leaf. In short,\r\nClym did not know what to do.\r\n\r\nWhen next they met she said abruptly, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is much more respectable now\r\nthan he was then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho? O yes\xe2\x80\x94Diggory Venn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt only objected because he was a reddleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Thomasin, perhaps I don\xe2\x80\x99t know all the particulars of my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s wish. So you had better use your own discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will always feel that I slighted your mother\xe2\x80\x99s memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I will not. I shall think you are convinced that, had she seen\r\nDiggory in his present position, she would have considered him a\r\nfitting husband for you. Now, that\xe2\x80\x99s my real feeling. Don\xe2\x80\x99t consult me\r\nany more, but do as you like, Thomasin. I shall be content.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is to be supposed that Thomasin was convinced; for a few days after\r\nthis, when Clym strayed into a part of the heath that he had not lately\r\nvisited, Humphrey, who was at work there, said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to\r\nsee that Mrs. Wildeve and Venn have made it up again, seemingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave they?\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym abstractedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and he do contrive to stumble upon her whenever she walks out on\r\nfine days with the chiel. But, Mr. Yeobright, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help feeling that\r\nyour cousin ought to have married you. \xe2\x80\x99Tis a pity to make two\r\nchimleycorners where there need be only one. You could get her away\r\nfrom him now, \xe2\x80\x99tis my belief, if you were only to set about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I have the conscience to marry after having driven two women\r\nto their deaths? Don\xe2\x80\x99t think such a thing, Humphrey. After my\r\nexperience I should consider it too much of a burlesque to go to church\r\nand take a wife. In the words of Job, \xe2\x80\x98I have made a covenant with mine\r\neyes; when then should I think upon a maid?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mr. Clym, don\xe2\x80\x99t fancy that about driving two women to their\r\ndeaths. You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99ll leave that out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yeobright. \xe2\x80\x9cBut anyhow God has set a\r\nmark upon me which wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look well in a love-making scene. I have\r\ntwo ideas in my head, and no others. I am going to keep a night-school;\r\nand I am going to turn preacher. What have you got to say to that,\r\nHumphrey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come and hear \xe2\x80\x99ee with all my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks. \xe2\x80\x99Tis all I wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Clym descended into the valley Thomasin came down by the other path,\r\nand met him at the gate. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think I have to tell you, Clym?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said, looking archly over her shoulder at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can guess,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\r\nShe scrutinized his face. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, you guess right. It is going to be\r\nafter all. He thinks I may as well make up my mind, and I have got to\r\nthink so too. It is to be on the twenty-fifth of next month, if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t object.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo what you think right, dear. I am only too glad that you see your\r\nway clear to happiness again. My sex owes you every amends for the\r\ntreatment you received in days gone by.\xe2\x80\x9d*\r\n\r\n [*] The writer may state here that the original conception of the\r\n story did not design a marriage between Thomasin and Venn. He was to\r\n have retained his isolated and weird character to the last, and to\r\n have disappeared mysteriously from the heath, nobody knowing\r\n whither\xe2\x80\x94Thomasin remaining a widow. But certain circumstances of\r\n serial publication led to a change of intent.\r\n    Readers can therefore choose between the endings, and those with an\r\n    austere artistic code can assume the more consistent conclusion to\r\n    be the true one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nCheerfulness Again Asserts Itself at Blooms-End, and Clym Finds His\r\nVocation\r\n\r\n\r\nAnybody who had passed through Blooms-End about eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock on the\r\nmorning fixed for the wedding would have found that, while Yeobright\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse was comparatively quiet, sounds denoting great activity came from\r\nthe dwelling of his nearest neighbour, Timothy Fairway. It was chiefly\r\na noise of feet, briskly crunching hither and thither over the sanded\r\nfloor within. One man only was visible outside, and he seemed to be\r\nlater at an appointment than he had intended to be, for he hastened up\r\nto the door, lifted the latch, and walked in without ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe scene within was not quite the customary one. Standing about the\r\nroom was the little knot of men who formed the chief part of the Egdon\r\ncoterie, there being present Fairway himself, Grandfer Cantle,\r\nHumphrey, Christian, and one or two turf-cutters. It was a warm day,\r\nand the men were as a matter of course in their shirtsleeves, except\r\nChristian, who had always a nervous fear of parting with a scrap of his\r\nclothing when in anybody\xe2\x80\x99s house but his own. Across the stout oak\r\ntable in the middle of the room was thrown a mass of striped linen,\r\nwhich Grandfer Cantle held down on one side, and Humphrey on the other,\r\nwhile Fairway rubbed its surface with a yellow lump, his face being\r\ndamp and creased with the effort of the labour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaxing a bed-tick, souls?\xe2\x80\x9d said the newcomer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grandfer Cantle, as a man too busy to waste words.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I stretch this corner a shade tighter, Timothy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFairway replied, and the waxing went on with unabated vigour. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis\r\ngoing to be a good bed, by the look o\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Sam, after an\r\ninterval of silence. \xe2\x80\x9cWho may it be for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a present for the new folks that\xe2\x80\x99s going to set up housekeeping,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Christian, who stood helpless and overcome by the majesty of the\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, to be sure; and a valuable one, \xe2\x80\x99a b\xe2\x80\x99lieve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeds be dear to fokes that don\xe2\x80\x99t keep geese, bain\xe2\x80\x99t they, Mister\r\nFairway?\xe2\x80\x9d said Christian, as to an omniscient being.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the furze-dealer, standing up, giving his forehead a\r\nthorough mopping, and handing the beeswax to Humphrey, who succeeded at\r\nthe rubbing forthwith. \xe2\x80\x9cNot that this couple be in want of one, but\r\n\xe2\x80\x99twas well to show \xe2\x80\x99em a bit of friendliness at this great racketing\r\nvagary of their lives. I set up both my own daughters in one when they\r\nwas married, and there have been feathers enough for another in the\r\nhouse the last twelve months. Now then, neighbours, I think we have\r\nlaid on enough wax. Grandfer Cantle, you turn the tick the right way\r\noutwards, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll begin to shake in the feathers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the bed was in proper trim Fairway and Christian brought forward\r\nvast paper bags, stuffed to the full, but light as balloons, and began\r\nto turn the contents of each into the receptacle just prepared. As bag\r\nafter bag was emptied, airy tufts of down and feathers floated about\r\nthe room in increasing quantity till, through a mishap of Christian\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nwho shook the contents of one bag outside the tick, the atmosphere of\r\nthe room became dense with gigantic flakes, which descended upon the\r\nworkers like a windless snowstorm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never saw such a clumsy chap as you, Christian,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grandfer\r\nCantle severely. \xe2\x80\x9cYou might have been the son of a man that\xe2\x80\x99s never\r\nbeen outside Blooms-End in his life for all the wit you have. Really\r\nall the soldiering and smartness in the world in the father seems to\r\ncount for nothing in forming the nater of the son. As far as that chief\r\nChristian is concerned I might as well have stayed at home and seed\r\nnothing, like all the rest of ye here. Though, as far as myself is\r\nconcerned, a dashing spirit has counted for sommat, to be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ye let me down so, Father; I feel no bigger than a ninepin after\r\nit. I\xe2\x80\x99ve made but a bruckle hit, I\xe2\x80\x99m afeard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come. Never pitch yerself in such a low key as that, Christian;\r\nyou should try more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you should try more,\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the Grandfer with insistence, as if\r\nhe had been the first to make the suggestion. \xe2\x80\x9cIn common conscience\r\nevery man ought either to marry or go for a soldier. \xe2\x80\x99Tis a scandal to\r\nthe nation to do neither one nor t\xe2\x80\x99other. I did both, thank God!\r\nNeither to raise men nor to lay \xe2\x80\x99em low\xe2\x80\x94that shows a poor do-nothing\r\nspirit indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never had the nerve to stand fire,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Christian. \xe2\x80\x9cBut as to\r\nmarrying, I own I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked here and there, though without much fruit\r\nfrom it. Yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s some house or other that might have had a man for\r\na master\xe2\x80\x94such as he is\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s now ruled by a woman alone. Still it\r\nmight have been awkward if I had found her; for, d\xe2\x80\x99ye see, neighbours,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99d have been nobody left at home to keep down Father\xe2\x80\x99s spirits to\r\nthe decent pitch that becomes a old man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ve your work cut out to do that, my son,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grandfer Cantle\r\nsmartly. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish that the dread of infirmities was not so strong in\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d start the very first thing tomorrow to see the world over\r\nagain! But seventy-one, though nothing at home, is a high figure for a\r\nrover.... Ay, seventy-one, last Candlemasday. Gad, I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner have it\r\nin guineas than in years!\xe2\x80\x9d And the old man sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you be mournful, Grandfer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway. \xe2\x80\x9cEmpt some more\r\nfeathers into the bed-tick, and keep up yer heart. Though rather lean\r\nin the stalks you be a green-leaved old man still. There\xe2\x80\x99s time enough\r\nleft to ye yet to fill whole chronicles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBegad, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to \xe2\x80\x99em, Timothy\xe2\x80\x94to the married pair!\xe2\x80\x9d said Granfer\r\nCantle in an encouraged voice, and starting round briskly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go to\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em tonight and sing a wedding song, hey? \xe2\x80\x99Tis like me to do so, you\r\nknow; and they\xe2\x80\x99d see it as such. My \xe2\x80\x98Down in Cupid\xe2\x80\x99s Gardens\xe2\x80\x99 was well\r\nliked in four; still, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got others as good, and even better. What do\r\nyou say to my\r\n\r\nShe cal\xe2\x80\xb2-led to\xe2\x80\xb2 her love\xe2\x80\xb2\r\nFrom the lat\xe2\x80\xb2-tice a-bove,\r\n\xe2\x80\xb2O come in\xe2\x80\xb2 from the fog-gy fog\xe2\x80\xb2-gy dew\xe2\x80\xb2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twould please \xe2\x80\x99em well at such a time! Really, now I come to think of\r\nit, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t turned my tongue in my head to the shape of a real good\r\nsong since Old Midsummer night, when we had the \xe2\x80\x98Barley Mow\xe2\x80\x99 at the\r\nWoman; and \xe2\x80\x99tis a pity to neglect your strong point where there\xe2\x80\x99s few\r\nthat have the compass for such things!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo \xe2\x80\x99tis, so \xe2\x80\x99tis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway. \xe2\x80\x9cNow gie the bed a shake down. We\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nput in seventy pounds of best feathers, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s as many as\r\nthe tick will fairly hold. A bit and a drap wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be amiss now, I\r\nreckon. Christian, maul down the victuals from corner-cupboard if canst\r\nreach, man, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll draw a drap o\xe2\x80\x99 sommat to wet it with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey sat down to a lunch in the midst of their work, feathers around,\r\nabove, and below them; the original owners of which occasionally came\r\nto the open door and cackled begrudgingly at sight of such a quantity\r\nof their old clothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my soul I shall be chokt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway when, having extracted a\r\nfeather from his mouth, he found several others floating on the mug as\r\nit was handed round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve swallered several; and one had a tolerable quill,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam\r\nplacidly from the corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s that\xe2\x80\x94wheels I hear coming?\xe2\x80\x9d Grandfer Cantle exclaimed,\r\njumping up and hastening to the door. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, \xe2\x80\x99tis they back again\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t expect \xe2\x80\x99em yet this half-hour. To be sure, how quick marrying\r\ncan be done when you are in the mind for\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes, it can soon be _done_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairway, as if something should be\r\nadded to make the statement complete.\r\n\r\nHe arose and followed the Grandfer, and the rest also went to the door.\r\nIn a moment an open fly was driven past, in which sat Venn and Mrs.\r\nVenn, Yeobright, and a grand relative of Venn\xe2\x80\x99s who had come from\r\nBudmouth for the occasion. The fly had been hired at the nearest town,\r\nregardless of distance and cost, there being nothing on Egdon Heath, in\r\nVenn\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, dignified enough for such an event when such a woman as\r\nThomasin was the bride; and the church was too remote for a walking\r\nbridal-party.\r\n\r\nAs the fly passed the group which had run out from the homestead they\r\nshouted \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d and waved their hands; feathers and down floating\r\nfrom their hair, their sleeves, and the folds of their garments at\r\nevery motion, and Grandfer Cantle\xe2\x80\x99s seals dancing merrily in the\r\nsunlight as he twirled himself about. The driver of the fly turned a\r\nsupercilious gaze upon them; he even treated the wedded pair themselves\r\nwith something like condescension; for in what other state than heathen\r\ncould people, rich or poor, exist who were doomed to abide in such a\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x99s end as Egdon? Thomasin showed no such superiority to the group\r\nat the door, fluttering her hand as quickly as a bird\xe2\x80\x99s wing towards\r\nthem, and asking Diggory, with tears in her eyes, if they ought not to\r\nalight and speak to these kind neighbours. Venn, however, suggested\r\nthat, as they were all coming to the house in the evening, this was\r\nhardly necessary.\r\n\r\nAfter this excitement the saluting party returned to their occupation,\r\nand the stuffing and sewing were soon afterwards finished, when Fairway\r\nharnessed a horse, wrapped up the cumbrous present, and drove off with\r\nit in the cart to Venn\xe2\x80\x99s house at Stickleford.\r\n\r\nYeobright, having filled the office at the wedding service which\r\nnaturally fell to his hands, and afterwards returned to the house with\r\nthe husband and wife, was indisposed to take part in the feasting and\r\ndancing that wound up the evening. Thomasin was disappointed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could be there without dashing your spirits,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\nmight be too much like the skull at the banquet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, dear, apart from that, if you would excuse me, I should be glad.\r\nI know it seems unkind; but, dear Thomasin, I fear I should not be\r\nhappy in the company\xe2\x80\x94there, that\xe2\x80\x99s the truth of it. I shall always be\r\ncoming to see you at your new home, you know, so that my absence now\r\nwill not matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I give in. Do whatever will be most comfortable to yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClym retired to his lodging at the housetop much relieved, and occupied\r\nhimself during the afternoon in noting down the heads of a sermon, with\r\nwhich he intended to initiate all that really seemed practicable of the\r\nscheme that had originally brought him hither, and that he had so long\r\nkept in view under various modifications, and through evil and good\r\nreport. He had tested and weighed his convictions again and again, and\r\nsaw no reason to alter them, though he had considerably lessened his\r\nplan. His eyesight, by long humouring in his native air, had grown\r\nstronger, but not sufficiently strong to warrant his attempting his\r\nextensive educational project. Yet he did not repine\xe2\x80\x94there was still\r\nmore than enough of an unambitious sort to tax all his energies and\r\noccupy all his hours.\r\n\r\nEvening drew on, and sounds of life and movement in the lower part of\r\nthe domicile became more pronounced, the gate in the palings clicking\r\nincessantly. The party was to be an early one, and all the guests were\r\nassembled long before it was dark. Yeobright went down the back\r\nstaircase and into the heath by another path than that in front,\r\nintending to walk in the open air till the party was over, when he\r\nwould return to wish Thomasin and her husband good-bye as they\r\ndeparted. His steps were insensibly bent towards Mistover by the path\r\nthat he had followed on that terrible morning when he learnt the\r\nstrange news from Susan\xe2\x80\x99s boy.\r\n\r\nHe did not turn aside to the cottage, but pushed on to an eminence,\r\nwhence he could see over the whole quarter that had once been\r\nEustacia\xe2\x80\x99s home. While he stood observing the darkening scene somebody\r\ncame up. Clym, seeing him but dimly, would have let him pass silently,\r\nhad not the pedestrian, who was Charley, recognized the young man and\r\nspoken to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharley, I have not seen you for a length of time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yeobright.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you often walk this way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d the lad replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t often come outside the bank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were not at the Maypole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charley, in the same listless tone. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care for that\r\nsort of thing now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou rather liked Miss Eustacia, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d Yeobright gently asked.\r\nEustacia had frequently told him of Charley\xe2\x80\x99s romantic attachment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very much. Ah, I wish\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish, Mr. Yeobright, you could give me something to keep that once\r\nbelonged to her\xe2\x80\x94if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be very happy to. It will give me very great pleasure,\r\nCharley. Let me think what I have of hers that you would like. But come\r\nwith me to the house, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked towards Blooms-End together. When they reached the front it\r\nwas dark, and the shutters were closed, so that nothing of the interior\r\ncould be seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome round this way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym. \xe2\x80\x9cMy entrance is at the back for the\r\npresent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two went round and ascended the crooked stair in darkness till\r\nClym\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room on the upper floor was reached, where he lit a\r\ncandle, Charley entering gently behind. Yeobright searched his desk,\r\nand taking out a sheet of tissue-paper unfolded from it two or three\r\nundulating locks of raven hair, which fell over the paper like black\r\nstreams. From these he selected one, wrapped it up, and gave it to the\r\nlad, whose eyes had filled with tears. He kissed the packet, put it in\r\nhis pocket, and said in a voice of emotion, \xe2\x80\x9cO, Mr. Clym, how good you\r\nare to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go a little way with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym. And amid the noise of\r\nmerriment from below they descended. Their path to the front led them\r\nclose to a little side window, whence the rays of candles streamed\r\nacross the shrubs. The window, being screened from general observation\r\nby the bushes, had been left unblinded, so that a person in this\r\nprivate nook could see all that was going on within the room which\r\ncontained the wedding guests, except in so far as vision was hindered\r\nby the green antiquity of the panes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharley, what are they doing?\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym. \xe2\x80\x9cMy sight is weaker again\r\ntonight, and the glass of this window is not good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharley wiped his own eyes, which were rather blurred with moisture,\r\nand stepped closer to the casement. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Venn is asking Christian\r\nCantle to sing,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cand Christian is moving about in his\r\nchair as if he were much frightened at the question, and his father has\r\nstruck up a stave instead of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I can hear the old man\xe2\x80\x99s voice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym. \xe2\x80\x9cSo there\xe2\x80\x99s to be no\r\ndancing, I suppose. And is Thomasin in the room? I see something moving\r\nin front of the candles that resembles her shape, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. She do seem happy. She is red in the face, and laughing at\r\nsomething Fairway has said to her. O my!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat noise was that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Venn is so tall that he knocked his head against the beam in\r\ngieing a skip as he passed under. Mrs. Venn has run up quite frightened\r\nand now she\xe2\x80\x99s put her hand to his head to feel if there\xe2\x80\x99s a lump. And\r\nnow they be all laughing again as if nothing had happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo any of them seem to care about my not being there?\xe2\x80\x9d Clym asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not a bit in the world. Now they are all holding up their glasses\r\nand drinking somebody\xe2\x80\x99s health.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if it is mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, \xe2\x80\x99tis Mr. and Mrs. Venn\xe2\x80\x99s, because he is making a hearty sort of\r\nspeech. There\xe2\x80\x94now Mrs. Venn has got up, and is going away to put on her\r\nthings, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they haven\xe2\x80\x99t concerned themselves about me, and it is quite\r\nright they should not. It is all as it should be, and Thomasin at least\r\nis happy. We will not stay any longer now, as they will soon be coming\r\nout to go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe accompanied the lad into the heath on his way home, and, returning\r\nalone to the house a quarter of an hour later, found Venn and Thomasin\r\nready to start, all the guests having departed in his absence. The\r\nwedded pair took their seats in the four-wheeled dogcart which Venn\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead milker and handy man had driven from Stickleford to fetch them in;\r\nlittle Eustacia and the nurse were packed securely upon the open flap\r\nbehind; and the milker, on an ancient overstepping pony, whose shoes\r\nclashed like cymbals at every tread, rode in the rear, in the manner of\r\na body-servant of the last century.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we leave you in absolute possession of your own house again,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nThomasin as she bent down to wish her cousin good night. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be\r\nrather lonely for you, Clym, after the hubbub we have been making.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, that\xe2\x80\x99s no inconvenience,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clym, smiling rather sadly. And then\r\nthe party drove off and vanished in the night shades, and Yeobright\r\nentered the house. The ticking of the clock was the only sound that\r\ngreeted him, for not a soul remained; Christian, who acted as cook,\r\nvalet, and gardener to Clym, sleeping at his father\xe2\x80\x99s house. Yeobright\r\nsat down in one of the vacant chairs, and remained in thought a long\r\ntime. His mother\xe2\x80\x99s old chair was opposite; it had been sat in that\r\nevening by those who had scarcely remembered that it ever was hers. But\r\nto Clym she was almost a presence there, now as always. Whatever she\r\nwas in other people\xe2\x80\x99s memories, in his she was the sublime saint whose\r\nradiance even his tenderness for Eustacia could not obscure. But his\r\nheart was heavy, that Mother had _not_ crowned him in the day of his\r\nespousals and in the day of the gladness of his heart. And events had\r\nborne out the accuracy of her judgment, and proved the devotedness of\r\nher care. He should have heeded her for Eustacia\xe2\x80\x99s sake even more than\r\nfor his own. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was all my fault,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cO, my mother, my\r\nmother! would to God that I could live my life again, and endure for\r\nyou what you endured for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday after this wedding an unusual sight was to be seen on\r\nRainbarrow. From a distance there simply appeared to be a motionless\r\nfigure standing on the top of the tumulus, just as Eustacia had stood\r\non that lonely summit some two years and a half before. But now it was\r\nfine warm weather, with only a summer breeze blowing, and early\r\nafternoon instead of dull twilight. Those who ascended to the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the Barrow perceived that the erect form in the\r\ncentre, piercing the sky, was not really alone. Round him upon the\r\nslopes of the Barrow a number of heathmen and women were reclining or\r\nsitting at their ease. They listened to the words of the man in their\r\nmidst, who was preaching, while they abstractedly pulled heather,\r\nstripped ferns, or tossed pebbles down the slope. This was the first of\r\na series of moral lectures or Sermons on the Mount, which were to be\r\ndelivered from the same place every Sunday afternoon as long as the\r\nfine weather lasted.\r\n\r\nThe commanding elevation of Rainbarrow had been chosen for two reasons:\r\nfirst, that it occupied a central position among the remote cottages\r\naround; secondly, that the preacher thereon could be seen from all\r\nadjacent points as soon as he arrived at his post, the view of him\r\nbeing thus a convenient signal to those stragglers who wished to draw\r\nnear. The speaker was bareheaded, and the breeze at each waft gently\r\nlifted and lowered his hair, somewhat too thin for a man of his years,\r\nthese still numbering less than thirty-three. He wore a shade over his\r\neyes, and his face was pensive and lined; but, though these bodily\r\nfeatures were marked with decay there was no defect in the tones of his\r\nvoice, which were rich, musical, and stirring. He stated that his\r\ndiscourses to people were to be sometimes secular, and sometimes\r\nreligious, but never dogmatic; and that his texts would be taken from\r\nall kinds of books. This afternoon the words were as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat\r\ndown on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king\xe2\x80\x99s mother;\r\nand she sat on his right hand. Then she said, I desire one small\r\npetition of thee; I pray thee say me not nay. And the king said unto\r\nher, Ask, on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYeobright had, in fact, found his vocation in the career of an\r\nitinerant open-air preacher and lecturer on morally unimpeachable\r\nsubjects; and from this day he laboured incessantly in that office,\r\nspeaking not only in simple language on Rainbarrow and in the hamlets\r\nround, but in a more cultivated strain elsewhere\xe2\x80\x94from the steps and\r\nporticoes of town halls, from market-crosses, from conduits, on\r\nesplanades and on wharves, from the parapets of bridges, in barns and\r\nouthouses, and all other such places in the neighbouring Wessex towns\r\nand villages. He left alone creeds and systems of philosophy, finding\r\nenough and more than enough to occupy his tongue in the opinions and\r\nactions common to all good men. Some believed him, and some believed\r\nnot; some said that his words were commonplace, others complained of\r\nhis want of theological doctrine; while others again remarked that it\r\nwas well enough for a man to take to preaching who could not see to do\r\nanything else. But everywhere he was kindly received, for the story of\r\nhis life had become generally known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 122-0.txt or 122-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/1/2/122/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
