This word, in the\r\nslang of theft and murder, signifies a drinking-shop of the lowest\r\nclass. A returned convict, who, in this foul phraseology, is called an\r\n"ogre," or a woman in the same degraded state, who is termed an\r\n"ogress," generally keep such "cribs," frequented by the refuse of the\r\nParisian population; freed felons, thieves, and assassins are there\r\nfamiliar guests. If a crime is committed, it is here, in this filthy\r\nsewer, that the police throws its cast-net, and rarely fails to catch\r\nthe criminals it seeks to take.\r\n\r\nOn the night in question, the wind howled fiercely in the dark and dirty\r\ngullies of the Cite; the blinking and uncertain light of the lamps which\r\nswung to and fro in the sudden gusts were dimly reflected in pools of\r\nblack slush, which flowed abundantly in the midst of the filthy\r\npavement.\r\n\r\nThe murky-coloured houses, which were lighted within by a few panes of\r\nglass in the worm-eaten casements, overhung each other so closely that\r\nthe eaves of each almost touched its opposite neighbour, so narrow were\r\nthe streets. Dark and noisome alleys led to staircases still more black\r\nand foul, and so perpendicular that they could hardly be ascended by the\r\nhelp of a cord fixed to the dank and humid walls by holdfasts of iron.\r\n\r\nStalls of charcoal-sellers, fruit-sellers, or venders of refuse meat\r\noccupied the ground floor of some of these wretched abodes.\r\nNotwithstanding the small value of their commodities, the fronts of\r\nnearly all these shops were protected by strong bars of iron,--a proof\r\nthat the shopkeepers knew and dreaded the gentry who infested the\r\nvicinity.\r\n\r\nThe man of whom we have spoken, having entered the Rue aux Feves, which\r\nis in the centre of the Cite, slackened his pace: he felt he was on his\r\nown soil. The night was dark, and strong gusts of wind, mingled with\r\nrain, dashed against the walls. Ten o\'clock struck by the distant dial\r\nof the Palais de Justice. Women were huddled together under the vaulted\r\narches, deep and dark, like caverns; some hummed popular airs in a low\r\nkey; others conversed together in whispers; whilst some, dumb and\r\nmotionless, looked on mechanically at the wet, which fell and flowed in\r\ntorrents. The man in the carter\'s frock, stopping suddenly before one of\r\nthese creatures, silent and sad as she gazed, seized her by the arm, and\r\nsaid, "Ha! good evening, La Goualeuse."[2]\r\n\r\n  [2] Sweet-throated: in reference to the tone of her voice.\r\n\r\nThe girl receded, saying, in a faint and fearful tone, "Good evening,\r\nChourineur.[3] Don\'t hurt me."\r\n\r\n  [3] One who strikes with the knife; the stabber, or slasher.\r\n\r\nThis man, a liberated convict, had been so named at the hulks.\r\n\r\n"Now I have you," said the fellow; "you must pay me the glass of \'tape\'\r\n(_eau d\'aff_), or I\'ll make you dance without music," he added, with a\r\nhoarse and brutal laugh.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Heaven! I have no money," replied Goualeuse, trembling from head to\r\nfoot, for this man was the dread of the district.\r\n\r\n"If you\'re stumped, the ogress of the _tapis-franc_ will give you tick\r\nfor your pretty face."\r\n\r\n"She won\'t; I already owe her for the clothes I\'m wearing."\r\n\r\n"What, you want to shirk it?" shouted the Chourineur, darting after La\r\nGoualeuse, who had hid herself in a gully as murk as midnight.\r\n\r\n"Now, then, my lady, I\'ve got you!" said the vagabond, after groping\r\nabout for a few moments, and grasping in one of his coarse and powerful\r\nhands a slim and delicate wrist; "and now for the dance I promised you."\r\n\r\n"No, it is _you_ who shall dance!" was uttered by a masculine and deep\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"A man! Is\'t you, Bras Rouge? Speak, why don\'t you? and don\'t squeeze so\r\nhard. I am here in the entrance to your \'ken,\' and you it must be."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis not Bras Rouge!" said the voice.\r\n\r\n"Oh! isn\'t it? Well, then, if it is not a friend, why, here goes at\r\nyou," exclaimed the Chourineur. "But whose bit of a hand is it I have\r\ngot hold of? It must be a woman\'s!"\r\n\r\n"It is the fellow to this," responded the voice.\r\n\r\nAnd under the delicate skin of this hand, which grasped his throat with\r\nsudden ferocity, the Chourineur felt himself held by nerves of iron.\r\nThe Goualeuse, who had sought refuge in this alley, and lightly ascended\r\na few steps, paused for an instant, and said to her unknown defender,\r\n"Thanks, sir, for having taken my part. The Chourineur said he would\r\nstrike me because I could not pay for his glass of brandy; but I think\r\nhe only jested. Now I am safe, pray let him go. Take care of yourself,\r\nfor he is the Chourineur."\r\n\r\n"If he be the Chourineur, I am a bully boy who never knuckles down,"\r\nexclaimed the unknown.\r\n\r\nAll was then silent for a moment, and then were heard for several\r\nseconds, in the midst of the pitchy darkness, sounds of a fierce\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\n"Who the devil is this?" then said the ruffian, making a desperate\r\neffort to free himself from his adversary, whose extraordinary power\r\nastonished him. "Now, then, now you shall pay both for La Goualeuse and\r\nyourself!" he shouted, grinding his teeth.\r\n\r\n"Pay! yes, I will pay you, but it shall be with my fists; and it shall\r\nbe cash in full," replied the unknown.\r\n\r\n"If," said the Chourineur, in a stifled voice, "you do but let go my\r\nneckcloth, I will bite your nose off."\r\n\r\n"My nose is too small, my lad, and you haven\'t light enough to see it."\r\n\r\n"Come under the \'hanging glim\'[4] there."\r\n\r\n  [4] Under the lamp, called _reverbere_.\r\n\r\n"That I will," replied the unknown, "for then we may look into the\r\nwhites of each other\'s eyes."\r\n\r\nHe then made a desperate rush at the Chourineur, whom he still held by\r\nthe throat, and forced him to the end of the alley, and then thrust him\r\nviolently into the street, which was but dimly lighted by the suspended\r\nstreet-lamp. The bandit stumbled; but, rapidly recovering his feet, he\r\nthrew himself furiously upon the unknown, whose slim and graceful form\r\nappeared to belie the possession of the irresistible strength he had\r\ndisplayed. After a struggle of a few minutes, the Chourineur, although\r\nof athletic build, and a first-rate champion in a species of pugilism\r\nvulgarly termed the _savate_, found that he had got what they call his\r\nmaster. The unknown threw him twice with immense dexterity, by what is\r\ncalled, in wrestling, the leg-pass, or crook. Unwilling, however, to\r\nacknowledge the superiority of his adversary, the Chourineur, boiling\r\nwith rage, returned again to the charge. Then the defender of La\r\nGoualeuse, suddenly altering his mode of attack, rained on the head and\r\nface of the bandit a shower of blows with his closed fist, as hard and\r\nheavy as if stricken by a steel gauntlet. These blows, worthy of the\r\nadmiration of Jem Belcher, Dutch Sam, Tom Cribb, or any other celebrated\r\nEnglish pugilist, were so entirely different from the system of the\r\n_savate_, that the Chourineur dropped like an ox on the pavement,\r\nexclaiming, as he fell, "I\'m floored!" (_Mon linge est lave!_)\r\n\r\n"_Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!_ Have pity on him!" exclaimed La Goualeuse, who,\r\nduring the contest, had ventured on the threshold of the alley, adding,\r\nwith an air of astonishment, "But who are you, then? Except the\r\nSchoolmaster and Skeleton, there is no one, from the Rue Saint Eloi to\r\nNotre Dame, who can stand against the Chourineur. I thank you very, very\r\nmuch, sir, for, indeed, I fear that, without your aid, he would have\r\nbeaten me."\r\n\r\nThe unknown, instead of replying, listened with much attention to the\r\nvoice of this girl. Perhaps a tone more gentle, sweet, and silvery never\r\nfell on human ear. He endeavoured to examine the features of La\r\nGoualeuse; but the night was too dark, and the beams of the street-lamp\r\ntoo flickering and feeble. After remaining for some minutes quite\r\nmotionless, the Chourineur shook his legs and arms, and then partly rose\r\nfrom the ground.\r\n\r\n"Pray be on your guard!" exclaimed the Goualeuse, retreating again into\r\nthe dark passage, and taking her champion by the arm; "take care, or he\r\nwill have his revenge on you."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be frightened, my child; if he has not had enough, I have more\r\nready for him."\r\n\r\nThe brigand heard these words.\r\n\r\n"Thanks," he murmured; "I\'m half throttled, and one eye is closed,--that\r\nis quite enough for one day. Some other time, perhaps, when we may meet\r\nagain--"\r\n\r\n"What! not content yet,--grumbling still?" said the unknown, with a\r\nmenacing tone.\r\n\r\n"No, no,--not at all; I do not grumble in the least. You have regularly\r\nserved me out,--you are a lad of mettle," said the Chourineur, in a\r\ncoarse tone, but still with that sort of deference which physical\r\nsuperiority always finds in persons of his grade. "You are the better\r\nman, that\'s clear. Well, except the Skeleton, who seems to have bones of\r\niron, he is so thin and powerful, and the Schoolmaster, who could eat\r\nthree Herculeses for his breakfast, no man living could boast of having\r\nput his foot on my neck."\r\n\r\n"Well, and what then?"\r\n\r\n"Why, now I have found my master, that\'s all; you will find yours some\r\nday sooner or later,--everybody does. One thing, however, is certain;\r\nnow that you are a better man than the Chourineur, you may \'go your\r\nlength\' in the Cite. All the women will be your slaves; ogres and\r\nogresses will give you credit, if it is only for fear; you may be a king\r\nin your way! But who and what are you? You \'patter flash\' like a family\r\nman! If you are a \'prig\' I\'ll have nothing to do with you. I have used\r\nthe knife, it is true, because, when the blood comes into my eyes, I see\r\n_red_, and I must strike, in spite of myself; but I have paid for my\r\nslashing, by going to the hulks for fifteen years. My time is up, and I\r\nam free from surveillance. I can now live in the capital, without fear\r\nof the \'beaks;\' and I have never prigged,--have I, La Goualeuse?"\r\n\r\n"No, he was never a thief," said the girl.\r\n\r\n"Come along, then, and let us have a glass of something together, and\r\nI\'ll tell you who I am," said the unknown. "Come, don\'t let us bear\r\nmalice."\r\n\r\n"Bear malice! Devil a bit! You are master,--I confess it. You do know\r\nhow to handle your fists; I never knew anything like it. Thunder and\r\nlightning! how your thumps fell on my sconce,--I never felt anything\r\nlike it. Yours is a new game, and you must teach it to me."\r\n\r\n"I will recommence whenever you like."\r\n\r\n"Not on me, though, thank ye,--not on me," exclaimed the Chourineur,\r\nlaughing; "your blows fell as if from a sledge-hammer; I am still giddy\r\nfrom them. But do you know Bras Rouge, in whose passage you were?"\r\n\r\n"Bras Rouge?" said the unknown, who appeared disagreeably surprised at\r\nthe question; adding, however, with an indifferent air, "I do not know\r\nBras Rouge. Is he the only person who inhabits this abode? It rained in\r\ntorrents, and I took shelter in the alley. You meant to beat this poor\r\ngirl, and I have thrashed you,--that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"You\'re right; I have nothing to do with your affairs. Bras Rouge has a\r\nroom here, but does not occupy it often. He is usually at his\r\n_estaminet_ in the Champs Elysees. But what\'s the good of talking about\r\nhim?" Then turning to the Goualeuse, "On my word, you are a good wench,\r\nand I would not have beaten you; you know I would not harm a child,--it\r\nwas only my joke. Never mind; it was very good of you not to set on this\r\nfriend of yours against me when I was down, and at his mercy. Come and\r\ndrink with us; he pays for all. By the way, my trump," said he to the\r\nunknown, "what say you, instead of going to tipple, shall we go and have\r\na crust for supper with the ogress at the White Rabbit? It is a\r\n_tapis-franc_."\r\n\r\n"With all my heart. I will pay for the supper. You\'ll come with us,\r\nGoualeuse?" inquired the unknown.\r\n\r\n"Thanks, sir," she replied, "but, after having seen your struggle, it\r\nhas made my heart beat so that I have no appetite."\r\n\r\n"Pooh! pooh! one shoulder of mutton pokes the other down," said the\r\nChourineur; "the cookery at the White Rabbit is first-rate."\r\n\r\nThe three personages then, in perfect amity, bent their steps together\r\ntowards the tavern.\r\n\r\nDuring the contest between the Chourineur and the unknown, a\r\ncharcoal-seller, of huge size, ensconced in another passage, had\r\ncontemplated with much anxiety the progress of the combat, but without\r\nattempting to offer the slightest assistance to either antagonist. When\r\nthe unknown, the Chourineur, and the Goualeuse proceeded to the\r\npublic-house, the charcoal-man followed them.\r\n\r\nThe beaten man and the Goualeuse first entered the _tapis-franc_; the\r\nunknown was following, when the charcoal-man accosted him, and said, in\r\na low voice, in the German language, and in a most respectful tone of\r\nremonstrance, "Pray, your highness, be on your guard."\r\n\r\nThe unknown shrugged his shoulders, and rejoined his new companion. The\r\ncharcoal-dealer did not leave the door of the cabaret, but listened\r\nattentively, and gazed from time to time through a small hole which had\r\nbeen accidentally made in the thick coat of whitening, with which the\r\nwindows of such haunts as these are usually covered on the inside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE OGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe White Rabbit is situated in the centre of the Rue aux Feves. This\r\ntavern occupies the ground floor of a lofty house, the front of which is\r\nformed by two windows, which are styled "a guillotine." Hanging from the\r\nfront of the door leading to a dark and arched passage, was an oblong\r\nlamp, on the cracked panes of which were written, in red letters,\r\n"Nightly Lodgings Here."\r\n\r\nThe Chourineur, the unknown, and the Goualeuse entered into a large but\r\nlow apartment, with the ceiling smoked, and crossed by black rafters,\r\njust visible by the flickering light of a miserable suspended lamp. The\r\ncracked walls, formerly covered with plaster, were now ornamented in\r\nplaces with coarse drawings, or sentences of flash and obscenity.\r\n\r\nThe floor, composed of earth beaten together with saltpetre, was thick\r\nwith dirt; an armful of straw--an apology for a carpet--was placed at\r\nthe foot of the ogress\'s counter, which was at the right hand of the\r\ndoor, just beneath the dim lantern.\r\n\r\nOn each side of this room there were six tables, one end of each of\r\nwhich was nailed to the wall, as well as the benches on either side of\r\nthem. At the farther end was a door leading to a kitchen; on the right,\r\nnear the counter, was a passage which led into a den where persons slept\r\nfor the night at three halfpence a head.\r\n\r\nA few words will describe the ogress and her guests. The lady was called\r\nMother Ponisse; her triple trade consisted in letting furnished\r\napartments, keeping a public-house, and _lending_ clothes to the\r\nmiserable creatures who infest these foul streets.\r\n\r\nThe ogress was about forty years of age, bulky, fat, and heavy. She had\r\na full colour, and strong symptoms of a beard. Her deep voice, her\r\nenormous arms, and coarse hands betokened uncommon strength. She wore on\r\nher cap a large red and yellow handkerchief; a shawl of rabbit-skin was\r\ncrossed over her bosom, and tied behind; her woollen gown fell upon\r\nblack wooden shoes, scorched almost black by the small stove at which\r\nshe warmed her feet; and, to crown her beauty, she had a copper\r\ncomplexion, which the use of strong liquors had materially tended to\r\nheighten.\r\n\r\nThe counter, covered with lead, was decked with jugs with iron hoops,\r\nand various pewter measures. In an open cupboard, fastened to the wall,\r\nthere were several flasks of glass, so fashioned as to represent the\r\npedestrian figure of the Emperor. These bottles contained sundry\r\ncordials, red and green in colour, and known by the names of "Drops for\r\nthe Brave," "Ratafia of the Column," etc., etc.\r\n\r\nA large black cat, with green eyes, was sitting near the ogress, and\r\nseemed the familiar demon of the place. Then, in strange contrast, a\r\nholy branch of boxwood, bought at church by the ogress, was suspended at\r\nthe back of an old cuckoo clock.\r\n\r\nTwo marvellously ill-favoured fellows, with unshaven beards, and their\r\ngarb all in tatters, hardly tasted of the pitcher of wine before them,\r\nand conversed together in low voices, and with uneasy aspect. One of the\r\ntwo, very pale and livid, pulled, from time to time, his shabby\r\nskull-cap over his brows, and concealed as much as possible his left\r\nhand, and, even when compelled to use it, he did so with caution.\r\n\r\nFurther on there was a young man, hardly sixteen years of age, with\r\nbeardless chin, and a countenance wan, wrinkled, and heavy, his eye\r\ndull, and his long black hair straggling down his neck. This youthful\r\nrake, the emblem of precocious vice, was smoking a short black pipe. His\r\nback was resting against the wall, and his two hands were in the pockets\r\nof his blouse, and his legs stretched along the bench. He did not cease\r\nsmoking for a moment, unless it was to drink from a cannikin of brandy\r\nplaced before him.\r\n\r\nThe other inmates of the _tapis-franc_, men and women, presented no\r\nremarkable characteristics. There was the ferocious or embruted\r\nface,--the vulgar and licentious mirth; but from time to time there was\r\na deep and dull silence. Such were the guests of the _tapis-franc_ when\r\nthe unknown, the Chourineur, and the Goualeuse entered.\r\n\r\nThese three persons play such important parts in our recital, that we\r\nmust put them in relief.\r\n\r\nThe Chourineur was a man of lofty stature and athletic make, with hair\r\nof a pale brown, nearly white; thick eyebrows, and enormous whiskers of\r\ndeep red. The sun\'s rays, misery, and the severe toil of the galleys had\r\nbronzed his skin to that deep and olive hue which is peculiar to\r\nconvicts. In spite of his horrible nickname, his features did not\r\nexpress ferocity, but a sort of coarse familiarity and irrepressible\r\naudacity. We have said already that the Chourineur was clothed in\r\ntrousers and frock of blue cotton, and on his head he had one of those\r\nlarge straw hats usually worn by workmen in timber-yards, and\r\nbarge-emptiers.\r\n\r\nThe Goualeuse was, perhaps, about sixteen and a half years old. A\r\nforehead, of the purest and whitest, surmounted a face of perfect oval\r\nand angel-like expression; a fringe of eyelids, so long that they curled\r\nslightly, half veiled her large blue eyes, which had a melancholy\r\nexpression. The down of early youth graced cheeks lightly coloured with\r\na scarlet tinge. Her small and rosy mouth, which hardly ever smiled, her\r\nnose, straight, and delicately chiselled, her rounded chin, had, in\r\ntheir combined expression, a nobility and a sweetness such as we can\r\nonly find in the most beautiful of Raphael\'s portraits. On each side of\r\nher fair temples was a band of hair, of the most splendid auburn hue,\r\nwhich descended in luxuriant ringlets half way down her cheeks, and was\r\nthen turned back behind the ear, a portion of which--ivory shaded with\r\ncarnation--was thus visible, and was then lost under the close folds of\r\na large cotton handkerchief, with blue checks, tied, as it is called,\r\n_en marmotte_. Her graceful neck, of dazzling whiteness, was encircled\r\nby a small necklace of grains of coral. Her gown, of brown stuff, though\r\nmuch too large, could not conceal a charming form, supple and round as a\r\ncane; a worn-out small orange-coloured shawl, with green fringe, was\r\ncrossed over her bosom.\r\n\r\nThe lovely voice of the Goualeuse had made a strong impression on her\r\nunknown defender, and, in sooth, that voice, so gentle, so deliciously\r\nmodulated and harmonious, had an attraction so irresistible that the\r\nhorde of villains and abandoned women, in the midst of whom this\r\nunfortunate girl lived, often begged her to sing, and listened to her\r\nwith rapture.\r\n\r\nThe Goualeuse had another name, given, doubtless, to the maiden\r\nsweetness of her countenance,--she was also called Fleur-de-Marie.\r\n\r\nThe defender of La Goualeuse (we shall call the unknown Rodolph)\r\nappeared about thirty-six years of age; his figure, tall, graceful, and\r\nadmirably proportioned, yet did not betoken the astonishing vigour which\r\nhe had displayed in his rencounter with the Chourineur.\r\n\r\nIt would have been difficult to assign a decided character to the\r\nphysiognomy of Rodolph. Certain wrinkles in his forehead betokened a man\r\nof meditation; and yet the firm expression of his mouth, the dignified\r\nand bold carriage of the head, assured us of the man of action, whose\r\nphysical strength and presence of mind would always command an\r\nascendancy over the multitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Chourineur, Rodolph, and La Goualeuse_\r\nEtching by Adrian Marcel, after the drawing by Frank T. Merrill]\r\n\r\nIn his struggle with the Chourineur, Rodolph had neither betrayed anger\r\nnor hatred. Confident in his own strength, his address, and agility, he\r\nhad only shown a contempt for the brute beast which he subdued.\r\n\r\nWe will finish this bodily picture of Rodolph by saying that his\r\nfeatures, regularly handsome, seemed too beautiful for a man. His eyes\r\nwere large, and of a deep hazel, his nose aquiline, his chin rather\r\nprojecting, his hair bright chestnut, of the same shade as his eyebrows,\r\nwhich were strongly arched, and his small moustache, which was fine and\r\nsilky. Thanks to the manners and the language which he assumed with so\r\nmuch ease, Rodolph was exactly like the other guests of the ogress.\r\nRound his graceful neck, as elegantly modelled as that of the Indian\r\nBacchus, he wore a black cravat, carelessly tied, the ends of which fell\r\non the collar of his blue blouse. A double row of nails decorated his\r\nheavy shoes, and, except that his hands were of most aristocratic shape,\r\nnothing distinguished him from the other guests of the _tapis-franc_;\r\nthough, in a moral sense, his resolute air, and what we may term his\r\nbold serenity, placed an immense distance between them.\r\n\r\nOn entering the _tapis-franc_, the Chourineur, laying one of his heavy\r\nhands on the shoulders of Rodolph, cried, "Hail the conqueror of the\r\nChourineur! Yes, my boys, this springald has floored me; and if any\r\nyoung gentleman wishes to have his ribs smashed, or his \'nob in\r\nChancery,\' even including the Schoolmaster and the Skeleton, here is\r\ntheir man; I will answer for him, and back him!"\r\n\r\nAt these words, all present, from the ogress to the lowest ruffian of\r\nthe _tapis-franc_, contemplated the victor of the Chourineur with\r\nrespect and fear. Some, moving their glasses and jugs to the end of the\r\ntable at which they were seated, offered Rodolph a seat, if he were\r\ninclined to sit near them; others approached the Chourineur, and asked\r\nhim, in a low voice, for the particulars of this unknown, who had made\r\nhis entrance into their world in so striking a manner.\r\n\r\nThen the ogress, accosting Rodolph with one of her most gracious\r\nsmiles,--a thing unheard of, and almost deemed fabulous, in the annals\r\nof the White Rabbit,--rose from the bar to take the orders of her guest,\r\nand know what he desired to have for the refreshment of his party,--an\r\nattention which she did not evince either to the Schoolmaster or the\r\nSkeleton, two fearful ruffians, who made even the Chourineur tremble.\r\n\r\nOne of the men with the villainous aspect, whom we have before described\r\nas being very pale, hiding his left hand, and continually pulling his\r\ncap over his brows, leaned towards the ogress, who was carefully wiping\r\nthe table where Rodolph had taken his seat, and said to her, in a hoarse\r\ntone, "Hasn\'t the Gros-Boiteux been here to-day?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Mother Ponisse.\r\n\r\n"Nor yesterday?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he came yesterday."\r\n\r\n"Was Calebasse with him,--the daughter of Martial, who was guillotined?\r\nYou know whom I mean,--the Martials of the Ile de Ravageur?"\r\n\r\n"What! do you take me for a spy, with your questions? Do you think I\r\nwatch my customers?" said the ogress, in a brutal tone.\r\n\r\n"I have an appointment to-night with the Gros-Boiteux and the\r\nSchoolmaster," replied the fellow; "we have some business together."\r\n\r\n"That\'s your affair,--a set of ruffians, as you are, altogether."\r\n\r\n"Ruffians!" said the man, much incensed; "it is such ruffians you get\r\nyour living by."\r\n\r\n"Will you hold your jaw?" said the Amazon, with a threatening gesture,\r\nand lifting, as she spoke, the pitcher she held in her hand.\r\n\r\nThe man resumed his place, grumbling as he did so.\r\n\r\n"The Gros-Boiteux has, perhaps, stayed to give that young fellow\r\nGermain, who lives in the Rue du Temple, his gruel," said he, to his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n"What, do they mean to _do_ for him?"\r\n\r\n"No, not quite, but to make him more careful in future. It appears he\r\nhas \'blown the gaff\' in the job at Nantes, so Bras Rouge declares."\r\n\r\n"Why, that is Gros-Boiteux\'s affair; he has only just left prison, and\r\nhas his hands full already."\r\n\r\nFleur-de-Marie had followed the Chourineur into the tavern of the\r\nogress, and he, responding to a nod given to him by the young scamp with\r\nthe jaded aspect, said, "Ah, Barbillon! what, pulling away at the old\r\nstuff?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I would rather fast, and go barefoot any day, than be without my\r\ndrops for my throttle, and the weed for my pipe," said the rapscallion,\r\nin a thick, low, hoarse voice, without moving from his seat, and puffing\r\nout volumes of tobacco-smoke.\r\n\r\n"Good evening, Fleur-de-Marie," said the ogress, looking with a prying\r\neye on the clothes of the poor girl,--clothes which she had lent her.\r\nAfter her scrutiny, she said, in a tone of coarse satisfaction, "It\'s\r\nreally a pleasure--so it is--to lend one\'s good clothes to you; you are\r\nas clean as a kitten, or else I would never have trusted you with that\r\nshawl. Such a beauty as that orange one is, I would never have trusted\r\nit to such gals as Tourneuse and Boulotte; but I have taken every care\r\n_on_ you ever since you came here six weeks ago; and, if the truth must\r\nbe said, there is not a tidier nor more nicer girl than you in all the\r\nCite; that there ain\'t; though you be al\'ays so sad like, and too\r\nparticular."\r\n\r\nThe Goualeuse sighed, turned her head, and said nothing.\r\n\r\n"Why, mother," said Rodolph to the old hag, "you have got some holy\r\nboxwood, I see, over your cuckoo," and he pointed with his finger to the\r\nconsecrated bough behind the old clock.\r\n\r\n"Why, you heathen, would you have us live like dogs?" replied the\r\nogress. Then addressing Fleur-de-Marie, she added, "Come, now,\r\nGoualeuse, tip us one of your pretty little ditties" (_goualantes_).\r\n\r\n"Supper, supper first, Mother Ponisse," said the Chourineur.\r\n\r\n"Well, my lad of wax, what can I do for you?" said the ogress to\r\nRodolph, whose good-will she was desirous to conciliate, and whose\r\nsupport she might, perchance, require.\r\n\r\n"Ask the Chourineur; he orders, I pay."\r\n\r\n"Well, then," said the ogress, turning to the bandit, "what will you\r\nhave for supper, you \'bad lot?\'"\r\n\r\n"Two quarts of the best wine, at twelve sous, three crusts of wheaten\r\nbread, and a harlequin,"[5] said the Chourineur, after considering for a\r\nfew moments what he should order.\r\n\r\n  [5] A "harlequin" is a collection of odds and ends of fish,\r\n  flesh, and fowl, after they come from table, which the Parisian,\r\n  providing for the class to which the Chourineur belongs, finds a\r\n  profitable and popular composition.\r\n\r\n"Ah! you are a dainty dog, I know, and as fond as ever of them\r\nharlequins."\r\n\r\n"Well, now, Goualeuse," said the Chourineur, "are you hungry?"\r\n\r\n"No, Chourineur."\r\n\r\n"Would you like anything better than a harlequin, my lass?" said\r\nRodolph.\r\n\r\n"No, I thank you; I have no appetite."\r\n\r\n"Come, now," said the Chourineur, with a brutal grin, "look my master in\r\nthe face like a jolly wench. You have no objection, I suppose?"\r\n\r\nThe poor girl blushed, and did not look at Rodolph. A few moments\r\nafterwards, and the ogress herself placed on the table a pitcher of\r\nwine, bread, and a harlequin, of which we will not attempt to give an\r\nidea to the reader, but which appeared most relishing to the Chourineur;\r\nfor he exclaimed, "_Dieu de Dieu!_ what a dish! What a glorious dish! It\r\nis a regular omnibus; there is something in it to everybody\'s taste.\r\nThose who like fat can have it; so can they who like lean; as well as\r\nthose who prefer sugar, and those who choose pepper. There\'s tender bits\r\nof chicken, biscuit, sausage, tarts, mutton-bones, pastry crust, fried\r\nfish, vegetables, woodcock\'s heads, cheese, and salad. Come, eat,\r\nGoualeuse, eat; it is so capital! You have been to a wedding breakfast\r\nsomewhere this morning."\r\n\r\n"No more than on other mornings. I ate this morning, as usual, my\r\nha\'porth of milk, and my ha\'porth of bread."\r\n\r\nThe entrance of another personage into the cabaret interrupted all\r\nconversation for a moment, and everybody turned his head in the\r\ndirection of the newcomer, who was a middle-aged man, active and\r\npowerful, wearing a loose coat and cap. He was evidently quite at home\r\nin the _tapis-franc_, and, in language familiar to all the guests,\r\nrequested to be supplied with supper. He was so placed that he could\r\nobserve the two ill-looking scoundrels who had asked after Gros-Boiteux\r\nand the Schoolmaster. He did not take his eyes off them; but in\r\nconsequence of their position, they could not see that they were the\r\nobjects of such marked and constant attention.\r\n\r\nThe conversation, momentarily interrupted, was resumed. In spite of his\r\nnatural audacity, the Chourineur showed a deference for Rodolph, and\r\nabstained from familiarity.\r\n\r\n"By Jove," said he to Rodolph, "although I have smarted for it, yet I am\r\nvery glad to have met with you."\r\n\r\n"What! because you relish the harlequin?"\r\n\r\n"Why, may be so; but more because I am all on the fret to see you\r\n\'serve out\' the Schoolmaster. To see him who has always crowed over me,\r\ncrowed over in his turn would do me good."\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose, then, that for your amusement I mean to spring at the\r\nSchoolmaster, and pin him like a bull-dog?"\r\n\r\n"No, but he\'ll have at you in a moment, when he learns that you are a\r\nbetter man than he," replied the Chourineur, rubbing his hands.\r\n\r\n"Well, I have coin enough left to pay him in full," said Rodolph, in a\r\ncareless tone; "but it is horrible weather: what say you to a cup of\r\nbrandy with sugar in it?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the ticket!" said the Chourineur.\r\n\r\n"And, that we may be better acquainted, we will tell each other who we\r\nare," added Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"The Albinos called the Chourineur a freed convict, worker at the wood\r\nthat floats at St. Paul\'s Quay; frozen in the winter, scorched in the\r\nsummer, from twelve to fifteen hours a day in the water; half man, half\r\nfrog; that\'s my description," said Rodolph\'s companion, making him a\r\nmilitary salute with his left hand. "Well, now, and you, my master, this\r\nis your first appearance in the Cite. I don\'t mean anything to offend;\r\nbut you entered head foremost against my skull, and beating the drum on\r\nmy carcass. By all that\'s ugly, what a rattling you made, especially\r\nwith these blows with which you doubled me up! I never can forget\r\nthem--thick as buttons--what a torrent! But you have some trade besides\r\n\'polishing off\' the Chourineur?"\r\n\r\n"I am a fan-painter, and my name is Rodolph."\r\n\r\n"A fan-painter! Ah! that\'s the reason, then, that your hands are so\r\nwhite," added the Chourineur. "If all your fellow workmen are like you,\r\nthere must be a tidy lot of you. But, as you are a workman, what brings\r\nyou to a _tapis-franc_ in the Cite, where there are only prigs,\r\ncracksmen or freed convicts like myself, and who only come here because\r\nwe cannot go elsewhere? This is no place for you. Honest mechanics have\r\ntheir coffee-shops, and don\'t talk slang."\r\n\r\n"I come here because I like good company."\r\n\r\n"Gammon!" said the Chourineur, shaking his head with an air of doubt. "I\r\nfound you in the passage of Bras Rouge. Well, man, never mind. You say\r\nyou don\'t know him?"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean with all your nonsense about your Bras Rouge? Let him\r\ngo to the--"\r\n\r\n"Stay, master of mine. You, perhaps, distrust me; but you are wrong, and\r\nif you like I will tell you my history; but that is on condition that\r\nyou teach me how to give those precious thumps which settled my business\r\nso quickly. What say you?"\r\n\r\n"I agree, Chourineur; tell me your story, and Goualeuse will also tell\r\nhers."\r\n\r\n"Very well," replied the Chourineur; "it is not weather to turn a mangy\r\ncur out-of-doors, and it will be an amusement. Do you agree, Goualeuse?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, certainly; but my story is a very short one," said Fleur-de-Marie.\r\n\r\n"And you will have to tell us your history, comrade Rodolph," added the\r\nChourineur.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I\'ll begin."\r\n\r\n"Fan-painter!" said Goualeuse, "what a very pretty trade!"\r\n\r\n"And how much can you earn if you stick close to work?" inquired the\r\nChourineur.\r\n\r\n"I work by the piece," responded Rodolph; "my good days are worth three\r\nfrancs, sometimes four, in summer, when the days are long."\r\n\r\n"And you are idle sometimes, you rascal?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, as long as I have money, though I do not waste it. First, I pay\r\nten sous for my night\'s lodging."\r\n\r\n"Your pardon, monseigneur; you sleep, then, at ten sous, do you?" said\r\nthe Chourineur, raising his hand to his cap.\r\n\r\nThe word monseigneur, spoken ironically by the Chourineur, caused an\r\nalmost imperceptible smile on the lips of Rodolph, who replied, "Oh, I\r\nlike to be clean and comfortable."\r\n\r\n"Here\'s a peer of the realm for you! a man with mines of wealth!"\r\nexclaimed the Chourineur; "he pays ten sous for his bed!"\r\n\r\n"Well, then," continued Rodolph, "four sous for tobacco; that makes\r\nfourteen sous; four sous for breakfast, eighteen; fifteen sous for\r\ndinner; one or two sous for brandy; that all comes to about thirty-four\r\nor thirty-five sous a day. I have no occasion to work all the week, and\r\nso the rest of the time I amuse myself."\r\n\r\n"And your family?" said the Goualeuse.\r\n\r\n"Dead," replied Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"Who were your friends?" asked the Goualeuse.\r\n\r\n"Dealers in old clothes and marine stores under the pillars of the\r\nmarket-place."\r\n\r\n"How did you spend what they left you?" inquired the Chourineur.\r\n\r\n"I was very young, and my guardian sold the stock; and, when I came of\r\nage, he brought me in his debtor for thirty francs; that was my\r\ninheritance."\r\n\r\n"And who is now your employer?" the Chourineur demanded.\r\n\r\n"His name is Gauthier, in the Rue des Bourdonnais, a\r\nbeast--brute--thief--miser! He would almost as soon lose the sight of an\r\neye as pay his workmen. Now this is as true a description as I can give\r\nyou of him; so let\'s have done with him. I learned my trade under him\r\nfrom the time when I was fifteen years of age; I have a good number in\r\nthe Conscription, and my name is Rodolph Durand. My history is told."\r\n\r\n"Now it\'s your turn, Goualeuse," said the Chourineur; "I keep my history\r\ntill last, as a _bonne bouche_."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF LA GOUALEUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Let us begin at the beginning," said the Chourineur.\r\n\r\n"Yes; your parents?" added Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"I never knew them," said Fleur-de-Marie.\r\n\r\n"The deuce!" said the Chourineur. "Well, that is odd, Goualeuse! you and\r\nI are of the same family."\r\n\r\n"What! you, too, Chourineur?"\r\n\r\n"An orphan of the streets of Paris like you, my girl."\r\n\r\n"Then who brought you up, Goualeuse?" asked Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, sir. As far back as I can remember--I was, I think, about\r\nsix or seven years old--I was with an old one-eyed woman, whom they call\r\nthe Chouette,[6] because she had a hooked nose, a green eye quite round,\r\nand was like an owl with one eye out."\r\n\r\n  [6] The Screech-owl.\r\n\r\n"Ha! ha! ha! I think I see her, the old night-bird!" shouted the\r\nChourineur, laughing.\r\n\r\n"The one-eyed woman," resumed Fleur-de-Marie, "made me sell barley-sugar\r\nin the evenings on the Pont Neuf; but that was only an excuse for asking\r\ncharity; and when I did not bring her in at least ten sous, the Chouette\r\nbeat me instead of giving me any supper."\r\n\r\n"Are you sure the woman was not your mother?" inquired Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"Quite sure; for she often scolded me for being fatherless and\r\nmotherless, and said she picked me up one day in the street."\r\n\r\n"So," said the Chourineur, "you had a dance instead of a meal, if you\r\ndid not pick up ten sous?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. And after that I went to lie down on some straw spread on the\r\nground; when I was cold--very cold."\r\n\r\n"I do not doubt it, for the feather of beans (straw) is a very cold sort\r\nof stuff," said the Chourineur. "A dung-heap is twice as good; but then\r\npeople don\'t like your smell, and say, \'Oh, the blackguard! where has he\r\nbeen?\'"\r\n\r\nThis remark made Rodolph smile, whilst Fleur-de-Marie thus continued:\r\n"Next day the one-eyed woman gave me a similar allowance for breakfast\r\nas for supper, and sent me to Montfaucon to get some worms to bait for\r\nfish; for in the daytime the Chouette kept her stall for selling\r\nfishing-lines, near the bridge of Notre Dame. For a child of seven years\r\nof age, who is half dead with hunger and cold, it is a long way from the\r\nRue de la Mortellerie to Montfaucon."\r\n\r\n"But exercise has made you grow as straight as an arrow, my girl; you\r\nhave no reason to complain of that," said the Chourineur, striking a\r\nlight for his pipe.\r\n\r\n"Well," said the Goualeuse, "I returned very, very tired; then, at noon,\r\nthe Chouette gave me a little bit of bread."\r\n\r\n"Ah, eating so little has kept your figure as fine as a needle, girl;\r\nyou must not find fault with that," said Chourineur, puffing out a cloud\r\nof tobacco-smoke. "But what ails you, comrade--I mean, Master Rodolph?\r\nYou seem quite down like; are you sorry for the girl and her miseries?\r\nAh, we all have, and have had, our miseries!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but not such miseries as mine, Chourineur," said Fleur-de-Marie.\r\n\r\n"What! not I, Goualeuse? Why, my lass, you were a queen to me! At least,\r\nwhen you were little you slept on straw and ate bread; I passed my most\r\ncomfortable nights in the lime-kilns at Clichy, like a regular vagabond;\r\nI fed on cabbage-stumps and other refuse vegetables, which I picked up\r\nwhen and where I could; but very often, as it was so far to the\r\nlime-kilns at Clichy, and I was tired after my work, I slept under the\r\nlarge stones at the Louvre; and then, in winter, I had white\r\nsheets,--that is, whenever the snow fell."\r\n\r\n"A man is stronger; but a poor little girl--" said Fleur-de-Marie. "And\r\nyet, with all that, I was as plump as a skylark."\r\n\r\n"What! you remember that, eh?"\r\n\r\n"To be sure I do. When the Chouette beat me I fell always at the first\r\nblow; then she stamped upon me, screaming out, \'Ah, the nasty little\r\nbrute! she hasn\'t a farden\'s worth of strength,--she can\'t stand even\r\ntwo thumps!\' And then she called me Pegriotte (little thief). I never\r\nhad any other name,--that was my baptismal name."\r\n\r\n"Like me. I had the baptism of a dog in a ditch, and they called me\r\n\'Fellow,\' or \'You, sir,\' or \'Albino.\' It is really surprising, my wench,\r\nhow much we resemble each other!" said the Chourineur.\r\n\r\n"That\'s true,--in our misery," said Fleur-de-Marie, who addressed\r\nherself to the Chourineur almost always, feeling, in spite of herself, a\r\nsort of shame at the presence of Rodolph, hardly venturing to raise her\r\neyes to him, although in appearance he belonged to that class with whom\r\nshe ordinarily lived.\r\n\r\n"And when you had fetched the worms for the Chouette, what did you do?"\r\ninquired the Chourineur.\r\n\r\n"Why, she made me beg until night; then, in the evening, she went to\r\nsell fried fish on the Pont Neuf. Oh, dear! at that time it was a long\r\nwhile to wait for my morsel of bread; and if I dared to ask the Chouette\r\nfor something to eat, she beat me and said, \'Get ten sous, and then you\r\nshall have your supper.\' Then I, being very hungry, and as she hurt me\r\nvery much, cried with a very full heart and sore body. The Chouette tied\r\nmy little basket of barley-sugar round my neck, and stationed me on the\r\nPont Neuf, where, in winter, I was frozen to death. Yet sometimes, in\r\nspite of myself, I slept as I stood,--but not long; for the Chouette\r\nkicked me until I awoke. I remained on the bridge till eleven o\'clock,\r\nmy stock of barley-sugar hanging round my neck, and often crying\r\nheartily. The passengers, touched by my tears, sometimes gave me a sou;\r\nand then I gained ten and sometimes fifteen sous, which I gave to the\r\nChouette, who searched me all over, and even looked in my mouth, to see\r\nif I had kept back anything."\r\n\r\n"Well, fifteen sous was a good haul for a little bird like you."\r\n\r\n"It was. And then the one-eyed woman seeing that--"\r\n\r\n"With her one eye?" said the Chourineur, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Of course, because she had but one. Well, then, she finding that when I\r\ncried I got most money, always beat me severely before she put me on the\r\nbridge."\r\n\r\n"Brutal, but cunning."\r\n\r\n"Well, at last I got hardened to blows; and as the Chouette got in a\r\npassion when I did not cry, why I, to be revenged upon her, the more she\r\nthumped me the more I laughed, although the tears came into my eyes with\r\nthe pain."\r\n\r\n"But, poor Goualeuse, did not the sticks of barley-sugar make you long\r\nfor them?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes, Chourineur; but I never tasted them. It was my ambition, and\r\nmy ambition ruined me. One day, returning from Montfaucon, some little\r\nboys beat me and stole my basket. I came back, well knowing what was in\r\nstore for me; and I had a shower of thumps and no bread. In the evening,\r\nbefore going to the bridge, the Chouette, savage because I had not\r\nbrought in anything the evening before, instead of beating me as usual\r\nto make me cry, made me bleed by pulling my hair from the sides of the\r\ntemples, where it is most tender."\r\n\r\n"_Tonnerre!_ that was coming it too strong," said the bandit, striking\r\nhis fist heavily on the table, and frowning sternly. "To beat a child is\r\nno such great thing, but to ill-use one so--Heaven and earth!"\r\n\r\nRodolph had listened attentively to the recital of Fleur-de-Marie, and\r\nnow looked at the Chourineur with astonishment: the display of such\r\nfeeling quite surprised him.\r\n\r\n"What ails you, Chourineur?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"What ails me? Ails me? Why, have you no feeling? That devil\'s dam of a\r\nChouette who so brutally used this girl! Are you as hard as your own\r\nfists?"\r\n\r\n"Go on, my girl," said Rodolph to Fleur-de-Marie, without appearing to\r\nnotice the Chourineur\'s appeal.\r\n\r\n"I have told you how the Chouette ill-used me to make me cry. I was then\r\nsent on to the bridge with my barley-sugar. The one-eyed was at her\r\nusual spot, and from time to time shook her doubled fist at me. However,\r\nas I had not broken my fast since the night before, and as I was very\r\nhungry, at the risk of putting the Chouette in a passion, I took a piece\r\nof barley-sugar, and began to eat it."\r\n\r\n"Well done, girl!"\r\n\r\n"I ate another piece--"\r\n\r\n"Bravo! go it, my hearties!"\r\n\r\n"I found it so good, not from daintiness, but real hunger. But then a\r\nwoman, who sold oranges, cried out to the one-eyed woman, \'Look ye\r\nthere, Chouette; Pegriotte is eating the barley-sugar!\'"\r\n\r\n"Oh, thunder and lightning!" said the Chourineur; "that would enrage\r\nher,--make her in a passion! Poor little mouse, what a fright you were\r\nin when the Chouette saw you!--eh?"\r\n\r\n"How did you get out of that affair, poor Goualeuse?" asked Rodolph,\r\nwith as much interest as the Chourineur.\r\n\r\n"Why, it was a serious matter to me,--but that was afterwards; for the\r\nChouette, although boiling over with rage at seeing me devour the\r\nbarley-sugar, could not leave her stove, for the fish was frying."\r\n\r\n"Ha! ha! ha! True, true,--that was a difficult position for her," said\r\nthe Chourineur, laughing heartily.\r\n\r\n"At a distance, the Chouette threatened me with her long iron fork; but\r\nwhen her fish was cooked, she came towards me. I had only collected\r\nthree sous, and I had eaten six sous\' worth. She did not say a word, but\r\ntook me by the hand and dragged me away with her. At this moment, I do\r\nnot know how it was that I did not die on the spot with fright. I\r\nremember it as well as if it was this very moment,--it was very near to\r\nNew Year\'s day, and there were a great many shops on the Pont Neuf, all\r\nfilled with toys, and I had been looking at them all the evening with\r\nthe greatest delight,--beautiful dolls, little furnished houses,--you\r\nknow how very amusing such things are for a child."\r\n\r\n"You had never had any playthings, had you, Goualeuse?" asked the\r\nChourineur.\r\n\r\n"I? _Mon Dieu!_ who was there to give me any playthings?" said the girl,\r\nin a sad tone. "Well, the evening passed. Although it was in the depth\r\nof winter, I only had on a little cotton gown, no stockings, no shift,\r\nand with wooden shoes on my feet: that was not enough to stifle me with\r\nheat, was it? Well, when the old woman took my hand, I burst out into a\r\nperspiration from head to foot. What frightened me most was, that,\r\ninstead of swearing and storming as usual, she only kept on grumbling\r\nbetween her teeth. She never let go my hand, but made me walk so\r\nfast--so very fast--that I was obliged to run to keep up with her, and\r\nin running I had lost one of my wooden shoes; and as I did not dare to\r\nsay so, I followed her with one foot naked on the bare stones. When we\r\nreached home it was covered with blood."\r\n\r\n"A one-eyed old devil\'s kin!" said the Chourineur, again thumping the\r\ntable in his anger. "It makes my heart quite cold to think of the poor\r\nlittle thing trotting along beside that cursed old brute, with her poor\r\nlittle foot all bloody!"\r\n\r\n"We lived in a garret in the Rue de la Montellerie; beside the entrance\r\nto our alley there was a dram-shop, and there the Chouette went in,\r\nstill dragging me by the hand. She then had a half pint of brandy at the\r\nbar."\r\n\r\n"The deuce! Why, I could not drink that without being quite fuddled!"\r\n\r\n"It was her usual quantity; perhaps that was the reason why she beat me\r\nof an evening. Well, at last we got up into our cock-loft; the Chouette\r\ndouble-locked the door; I threw myself on my knees, and asked her pardon\r\nfor having eaten the barley-sugar. She did not answer me, but I heard\r\nher mumbling to herself, as she walked about the room, \'What shall I do\r\nthis evening to this little thief, who has eaten all that barley-sugar?\r\nAh, I see!\' And she looked at me maliciously with her one green eye. I\r\nwas still on my knees, when she suddenly went to a shelf and took down a\r\npair of pincers."\r\n\r\n"Pincers!" exclaimed the Chourineur.\r\n\r\n"Yes, pincers."\r\n\r\n"What for?"\r\n\r\n"To strike you?" inquired Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"To pinch you?" said the Chourineur.\r\n\r\n"No, no," answered the poor girl, trembling at the very recollection.\r\n\r\n"To pull out your hair?"\r\n\r\n"No; to take out one of my teeth."\r\n\r\nThe Chourineur uttered a blasphemous oath, accompanied with such furious\r\nimprecations that all the guests in the _tapis-franc_ looked at him with\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n"Why, what is the matter with you?" asked Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"The matter! the matter! I\'ll skin her alive, that infernal old hag, if\r\nI can catch her! Where is she? Tell me, where is she? Let me find her,\r\nand I\'ll throttle the old--"\r\n\r\n"And did she really take out your tooth, my poor child,--that wretched\r\nmonster in woman\'s shape?" demanded Rodolph, whilst the Chourineur was\r\nventing his rage in a volley of the most violent reproaches.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; but not at the first pull. How I suffered! She held me with\r\nmy head between her knees, where she held it as if in a vice. Then, half\r\nwith her pincers, half with her fingers, she pulled out my tooth, and\r\nthen said, \'Now I will pull out one every day, Pegriotte; and when you\r\nhave not a tooth left I will throw you into the river, and the fish\r\nshall eat you.\'"\r\n\r\n"The old devil! To break and pull out a poor child\'s teeth in that way!"\r\nexclaimed the Chourineur, with redoubled fury.\r\n\r\n"And how did you escape her then?" inquired Rodolph of the Goualeuse.\r\n\r\n"Next day, instead of going to Montfaucon, I went on the side of the\r\nChamps Elysees, so frightened was I of being drowned by the Chouette. I\r\nwould have run to the end of the world, rather than be again in the\r\nChouette\'s hands. After walking and walking, I fairly lost myself; I had\r\nnot begged a farthing, and the more I thought the more frightened did I\r\nbecome. At night I hid myself in a timber-yard, under some piles of\r\nwood. As I was very little, I was able to creep under an old door and\r\nhide myself amongst a heap of logs. I was so hungry that I tried to gnaw\r\na piece of the bark, but I could not bite it,--it was too hard. At\r\nlength I fell asleep. In the morning, hearing a noise, I hid myself\r\nstill further back in the wood-pile. It was tolerably warm, and, if I\r\nhad had something to eat, I could not have been better off for the\r\nwinter."\r\n\r\n"Like me in the lime-kiln."\r\n\r\n"I did not dare to quit the timber-yard, for I fancied that the Chouette\r\nwould seek for me everywhere, to pull out my teeth and drown me, and\r\nthat she would be sure to catch me if I stirred from where I was."\r\n\r\n"Stay, do not mention that old beast\'s name again,--it makes the blood\r\ncome into my eyes! The fact is, that you have known misery,--bitter,\r\nbitter misery. Poor little mite! how sorry I am that I threatened to\r\nbeat you just now, and frightened you. As I am a man, I did not mean to\r\ndo it."\r\n\r\n"Why, would you not have beaten me? I have no one to defend me."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the very reason, because you are not like the others,--because\r\nyou have no one to take your part,--that I would not have beaten you.\r\nWhen I say no one, I do not mean our comrade Rodolph; but his coming was\r\na chance, and he certainly did give me my full allowance when we met."\r\n\r\n"Go on, my child," said Rodolph. "How did you get away from the\r\ntimber-yard?"\r\n\r\n"Next day, about noon, I heard a great dog barking under the wood-pile.\r\nI listened, and the bark came nearer and nearer; then a deep voice\r\nexclaimed, \'My dog barks,--somebody is hid in the yard!\' \'They are\r\nthieves,\' said another voice; and the men then began to encourage the\r\ndog, and cry, \'Find \'em! find \'em, lad!\' The dog ran to me, and, for\r\nfear of being bitten, I began to cry out with all my might and main.\r\n\'Hark!\' said one of them; \'I hear the cry of a child.\' They called back\r\nthe dog; I came out from the pile of wood, and saw a gentleman and a man\r\nin a blouse. \'Ah, you little thief! what are you doing in my\r\ntimber-yard?\' said the gentleman, in a cross tone. I put my hands\r\ntogether and said, \'Don\'t hurt me, pray. I have had nothing to eat for\r\ntwo days, and I\'ve run away from the Chouette, who pulled out my tooth,\r\nand said she would throw me over to the fishes. Not knowing where to\r\nsleep, I was passing before your door, and I slept for the night\r\namongst these logs, under this heap, not thinking I hurt anybody.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I\'m not to be gammoned by you, you little hussy! You came to steal my\r\nlogs. Go and call the watch,\' said the timber-merchant to his man."\r\n\r\n"Ah, the old vagabond! The old reprobate! Call the watch! Why didn\'t he\r\nsend for the artillery?" said the Chourineur. "Steal his logs, and you\r\nonly eight years old! What an old ass!"\r\n\r\n"\'Not true, sir,\' his man replied. \'Steal your logs, master! How can she\r\ndo that? She is not so big as the smallest piece!\' \'You are right,\'\r\nreplied the timber-merchant; \'but if she does not come for herself, she\r\ndoes for others. Thieves have a parcel of children, whom they send to\r\npry about and hide themselves to open the doors of houses. She must be\r\ntaken to the commissary, and mind she does not escape.\'"\r\n\r\n"Upon my life, this timber-merchant was more of a log than any log in\r\nhis own yard," said the Chourineur.\r\n\r\n"I was taken to the commissary," resumed Goualeuse. "I accused myself of\r\nbeing a wanderer, and they sent me to prison. I was sent before the\r\nTribunal, and sentenced, as a rogue and vagabond, to remain until I was\r\nsixteen years of age in a house of correction. I thank the judges much\r\nfor their kindness; for in prison I had food, I was not beaten, and it\r\nwas a paradise after the cock-loft of the Chouette. Then, in prison I\r\nlearned to sew; but, sad to say, I was idle: I preferred singing to\r\nwork, and particularly when I saw the sun shine. Ah, when the sun shone\r\non the walls of the prison I could not help singing; and then, when I\r\ncould sing, I seemed no longer to be a prisoner. It was after I began to\r\nsing so much that they called me Goualeuse, instead of Pegriotte. Well,\r\nwhen I was sixteen, I left the gaol. At the door, I found the ogress\r\nhere, and two or three old women, who had come to see my fellow\r\nprisoners, and who had always told me that when I left the prison they\r\nwould find work for me."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I see," said the Chourineur.\r\n\r\n"\'My pretty little maid,\' said the ogress and her old companions, \'come\r\nand lodge with us; we will give you good clothes, and then you may amuse\r\nyourself.\' I didn\'t like them, and refused, saying to myself, \'I know\r\nhow to sew very well, and I have two hundred francs in hand. I have been\r\neight years in prison, I should like to enjoy myself a bit,--that won\'t\r\nhurt anybody; work will come when the money is spent.\' And so I began to\r\nspend my two hundred francs. Ah, that was my mistake," added\r\nFleur-de-Marie, with a sigh. "I ought first to have got my work; but I\r\nhadn\'t a soul on earth to advise me. At sixteen, to be thrown on the\r\ncity of Paris, as I was, one is so lonely; and what is done is done. I\r\nhave done wrong, and I have suffered for it. I began then to spend my\r\nmoney: first, I bought flowers to put in my room,--I do love\r\nflowers!--then I bought a gown, a nice shawl, and I took a walk in the\r\nBois de Boulogne, and I went to St. Germains, Vincennes, and other\r\ncountry places. Oh, how I love the country!"\r\n\r\n"With a lover by your side, my girl?" asked the Chourineur.\r\n\r\n"Oh, _mon Dieu!_ no! I like to be my own mistress. I had my little\r\nexcursions with a friend who was in prison with me,--a good little girl\r\nas can be: they call her Rigolette, because she is always laughing."\r\n\r\n"Rigolette! Rigolette! I don\'t know her," said the Chourineur, who\r\nappeared to be appealing to his memory.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t think you knew her. I am sure Rigolette was very well behaved\r\nin prison, and always so gay and so industrious, she took out with her\r\nwhen she left the prison at least four hundred francs that she had\r\nearned. And then she is so particular!--you should see her! When I say I\r\nhad no one to advise me, I am wrong: I ought to have listened to her;\r\nfor, after having had a week\'s amusement together, she said to me, \'Now\r\nwe have had such a holiday, we ought to try for work, and not spend our\r\nmoney in waste.\' I, who was so happy in the fields and the woods,--it\r\nwas just at the end of spring, this year,--I answered, \'Oh, I must be\r\nidle a little longer, and then I will work hard.\' Since that time I have\r\nnot seen Rigolette, but I heard a few days since that she was living\r\nnear the Temple,--that she was a famous needlewoman, and earned at least\r\ntwenty-five sous a-day, and has a small workroom of her own; but now I\r\ncould not for the world see her again,--I should die with shame if I met\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"So, then, my poor girl," said Rodolph, "you spent your money in the\r\ncountry,--you like the country, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Like it? I love it! Oh, what would I not give to live there? Rigolette,\r\non the contrary, prefers Paris, and likes to walk on the Boulevards; but\r\nshe is so nice and so kind, she went into the country only to please\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"And you did not even leave yourself a few sous to live upon whilst you\r\nfound work?" said the Chourineur.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I had reserved about fifty francs; but it happened that I had for\r\nmy washerwoman a woman called Lorraine, a poor thing, with none but the\r\ngood God to protect her. She was then very near her confinement, and yet\r\nwas obliged all day long to be with her hands and feet in her\r\nwashing-tubs. She fell sick, and, not being able to work, applied for\r\nadmittance to a lying-in hospital, but there was no room. She could not\r\nwork, and her time was very near at hand, and she had not a son to pay\r\nfor the bed in a garret, from which they drove her. Fortunately, she met\r\none day, at the end of the Pont Notre-Dame, with Goubin\'s wife, who had\r\nbeen hiding for four days in a cellar of a house which was being pulled\r\ndown behind the Hotel Dieu--"\r\n\r\n"But why was Goubin\'s wife hiding?"\r\n\r\n"To escape from her husband, who threatened to kill her; and she only\r\nwent out at night to buy some bread, and it was then she met with the\r\npoor Lorraine, ill, and hardly able to drag herself along, for she was\r\nexpecting to be brought to bed every hour. Well, it seems this Goubin\'s\r\nwife took her to the cellar where she was hiding,--it was just a\r\nshelter, and no more. There she shared her bread and straw with the poor\r\nLorraine, who was confined in this cellar of a poor little infant; her\r\nonly covering and bed was straw! Well, it seems that Goubin\'s wife could\r\nnot bear it, and so, going out at all risks, even of being killed by her\r\nhusband, who was looking for her everywhere, she left the cellar in open\r\nday, and came to me. She knew I had still a little money left, and that\r\nI could assist her if I would; so, when Helmina had told me all about\r\npoor Lorraine, who was obliged to lie with her new-born babe on straw, I\r\ntold her to bring them both to my room at once, and I would take a\r\nchamber for her next to mine. This I did; and, oh, how happy she was,\r\npoor Lorraine, when she found herself in a bed, with her babe beside her\r\nin a little couch which I had bought for her! Helmina and I nursed her\r\nuntil she was able to get about again, and then, with the rest of my\r\nmoney, I enabled her to return to her washing-tubs."\r\n\r\n"And when all your money was spent on Lorraine and her infant, what did\r\nyou do, my child?" inquired Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"I looked out for work; but it was too late. I can sew very well, I have\r\ngood courage, and thought that I had only to ask for work and get it.\r\nAh! how I deceived myself! I went into a shop where they sell ready-made\r\nlinen, and asked for employment, and as I would not tell a story, I said\r\nI had just left prison. They showed me the door, without making me any\r\nanswer. I begged they would give me a trial, and they pushed me into the\r\nstreet as if I had been a thief. Then I remembered, too late, what\r\nRigolette had told me. Little by little I sold my small stock of clothes\r\nand linen, and when all was gone they turned me out of my lodging. I had\r\nnot tasted food for two days; I did not know where to sleep. At this\r\nmoment I met the ogress and one of her old women who knew where I\r\nlodged, and was always coming about me since I left prison. They told me\r\nthey would find me work, and I believed them. I went with them, so\r\nexhausted for want of food that my senses were gone. They gave me brandy\r\nto drink, and--and--here I am!" said the unhappy creature, hiding her\r\nface in her hands.\r\n\r\n"Have you lived a long time with the ogress, my poor girl?" asked\r\nRodolph, in accents of the deepest compassion.\r\n\r\n"Six weeks, sir," replied Goualeuse, shuddering as she spoke.\r\n\r\n"I see,--I see," said the Chourineur; "I know you now as well as if I\r\nwere your father and mother, and you had never left my lap. Well, well,\r\nthis is a confession indeed!"\r\n\r\n"It makes you sad, my girl, to tell the story of your life," said\r\nRodolph.\r\n\r\n"Alas! sir," replied Fleur-de-Marie, sorrowfully, "since I was born this\r\nis the first time it ever happened to me to recall all these things at\r\nonce, and my tale is not a merry one."\r\n\r\n"Well," said the Chourineur, ironically, "you are sorry, perhaps, that\r\nyou are not a kitchen-wench in a cook-shop, or a servant to some old\r\nbrutes who think of no one but themselves."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Fleur-de-Marie, with a deep sigh, "to be quite happy, we must\r\nbe quite virtuous."\r\n\r\n"Oh, what is your little head about now?" exclaimed the Chourineur, with\r\na loud burst of laughter. "Why not count your rosary in honour of your\r\nfather and mother, whom you never knew?"\r\n\r\n"My father and mother abandoned me in the street like a puppy that is\r\none too many in the house; perhaps they had not enough to feed\r\nthemselves," said Goualeuse, with bitterness. "I want nothing of\r\nthem,--I complain of nothing,--but there are lots happier than mine."\r\n\r\n"Yours! Why, what would you have? You are as handsome as a Venus, and\r\nyet only sixteen and a half; you sing like a nightingale, behave\r\nyourself very prettily, are called Fleur-de-Marie, and yet you complain!\r\nWhat will you say, I should like to know, when you will have a stove\r\nunder your \'paddlers,\' and a chinchilla boa, like the ogress?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I shall never be so old as she is."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you have a charm for never growing any older?"\r\n\r\n"No; but I could not lead such a life. I have already a bad cough."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I see you already in the \'cold-meat box.\' Go along, you silly\r\nchild, you!"\r\n\r\n"Do you often have such thoughts as these, Goualeuse?" said Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes. You, perhaps, M. Rodolph, understand me. In the morning,\r\nwhen I go to buy my milk from the milkwoman at the corner of Rue de la\r\nVieille-Draperie, with the sous which the ogress gives me, and see her\r\ngo away in her little cart drawn by her donkey, I do envy her so, and I\r\nsay to myself, \'She is going into the country, to the pure air, to her\r\nhome and her family;\' and then I return alone into the garret of the\r\nogress, where you cannot see plainly even at noonday."\r\n\r\n"Well, child, be good--laugh at your troubles--be good," said the\r\nChourineur.\r\n\r\n"Good! _mon Dieu!_ and how do you mean be good? The clothes I wear\r\nbelong to the ogress, and I am in debt to her for my board and lodging.\r\nI can\'t stir from her; she would have me taken up as a thief. I belong\r\nto her, and I must pay her."\r\n\r\nWhen she had uttered these last words, the unhappy girl could not help\r\nshuddering, and a tear trembled in her long eyelashes.\r\n\r\n"Well, but remain as you are, and do not compare yourself to a country\r\nmilkwoman," said the Chourineur. "Are you taking leave of your senses?\r\nOnly think, you may yet cut a figure in the capital, whilst the\r\nmilkwoman must boil the pot for her brats, milk her cows, gather grass\r\nfor her rabbits, and, perhaps, after all, get a black eye from her\r\nhusband when he comes home from the pot-house. Why, it is really\r\nridiculous to hear you talk of envying her."\r\n\r\nThe Goualeuse did not reply; her eye was fixed, her heart was full, and\r\nthe expression of her face was painfully distressed. Rodolph had\r\nlistened to the recital, made with so painful a frankness, with deep\r\ninterest. Misery, destitution, ignorance of the world, had weighed down\r\nthis wretched girl, cast at sixteen years of age on the wide world of\r\nParis!\r\n\r\nRodolph involuntarily thought of a beloved child whom he had lost,--a\r\ngirl, dead at six years of age, and who, had she survived, would have\r\nbeen, like Fleur-de-Marie, sixteen years and a half old. This\r\nrecollection excited the more highly his solicitude for the unhappy\r\ncreature whose narration he had just heard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE CHOURINEUR\'S HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader has not forgotten the two guests at the _tapis-franc_ who\r\nwere watched so closely by the third individual who had come into the\r\ncabaret. We have said that one of these fellows, who had on a Greek cap,\r\nand concealed his left hand with much care, asked the ogress if the\r\nSchoolmaster and Gros-Boiteux had not arrived.\r\n\r\nDuring the story of the Goualeuse, which they could not overhear, they\r\nhad been constantly talking in a very low tone, throwing occasional\r\nhurried glances at the door. He who wore the Greek cap said to his\r\ncomrade, "The Gros-Boiteux does not \'show,\' nor the Schoolmaster."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps the Skeleton has \'done for him,\' and made off with the \'swag.\'"\r\n\r\n"A precious \'go\' that would be for us, who \'laid the plant,\' and look\r\nout for our \'snacks,\'" replied the other.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer, who observed the two men, was seated too far off to hear a\r\nword they said, but, after having cautiously consulted a small paper\r\nconcealed at the bottom of his cap, he appeared satisfied with his\r\nremarks, rose from the table, and said to the ogress, who was sleeping\r\nat the bar, with her feet on the stove, and her great cat on her knee:\r\n\r\n"I say, Mother Ponisse, I shall soon be back again; take care of my\r\npitcher and my plate; I don\'t want any one to make free with them."\r\n\r\n"Make yourself easy, my fine fellow," said Mother Ponisse; "if your\r\nplate and pitcher are empty, no one will touch them."\r\n\r\nThe newcomer laughed loudly at the joke of the ogress, and then slipped\r\nout, so that his departure was unnoticed. At that moment when this man\r\nretired, and before the door could be shut, Rodolph saw the\r\ncharcoal-dealer, whose black face and tall form we have already alluded\r\nto, and he had just time to manifest to him, by an impatient gesture,\r\nhow much he disliked his watchful attendance; but the charcoal-man did\r\nnot appear to heed this in the least, and still kept hanging about the\r\n_tapis-franc_. The countenance of the Goualeuse became still more\r\nsaddened; with her back to the wall, her head drooping on her bosom, her\r\nfull blue eyes gazing mechanically about her, the unfortunate being\r\nseemed bowed down with the weight of her oppressive thoughts. Two or\r\nthree times, having met Rodolph\'s fixed look, she turned away, unable to\r\naccount to herself for the singular impression which the unknown had\r\ncaused her. Weighed down and abashed at his presence, she almost\r\nregretted having made so candid a narrative to him of her unhappy life.\r\nThe Chourineur, on the contrary, was quite in high spirits; he had\r\ndevoured the whole harlequin without the least assistance; the wine and\r\nbrandy had made him very communicative; the fact of his having found his\r\nmaster, as he called him, had been forgotten in the generous conduct of\r\nRodolph; and he also detected so decided a physical superiority, that\r\nhis humiliation had given way to a sentiment of admiration, mingled with\r\nfear and respect. This absence of rancour, and the savage pride with\r\nwhich he boasted of never having robbed, proved that the Chourineur was\r\nnot as yet thoroughly hardened. This had not escaped the sagacity of\r\nRodolph, and he awaited the man\'s recital with curiosity.\r\n\r\n"Now, my boy," said he, "we are listening."\r\n\r\nThe Chourineur emptied his glass, and thus began:\r\n\r\n"You, my poor girl, were at last taken to by the Chouette, whom the\r\ndevil confound! You never had a shelter until the moment when you were\r\nimprisoned as a vagabond. I can never recollect having slept in what is\r\ncalled a bed before I was nineteen years of age,--a happy age!--and then\r\nI became a trooper."\r\n\r\n"What, you have served, then, Chourineur?" said Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"Three years; but you will hear all about it: the stones of the Louvre,\r\nthe lime-kilns of Clichy, and the quarries of Montrouge, these were the\r\nhotels of my youth. Then I had my house in Paris and in the country. Who\r\nbut I--"\r\n\r\n"And what was your trade?"\r\n\r\n"Faith, master, I have a foggy recollection of having strolled about in\r\nmy childhood with an old rag-picker, who almost thumped me to death; and\r\nit must be true, for I have never since met one of these old Cupids,\r\nwith a wicker-work quiver, without a longing to pitch into him,--a proof\r\nthat one of them must have thumped me when I was a child. My first\r\nemployment was to help the knackers to cut the horses\' throats at\r\nMontfaucon. I was about ten or twelve. When I began to slash\r\n(_chouriner_) these poor old beasts, it had quite an impression on me.\r\nAt the month\'s end I thought no more about it; on the contrary, I began\r\nto like my trade. No one had his knife so sharpened and keen-edged as\r\nmine; and that made me rejoice in using it. When I had cut the animals\'\r\nthroats, they gave me for my trouble a piece of the thigh of some animal\r\nthat had died of disease; for those that they slaughter are sold to the\r\n\'cag-mag\' shops near the School of Medicine, who convert it into beef,\r\nmutton, veal, or game, according to the taste of purchasers. However,\r\nwhen I got to my morsel of horse\'s flesh, I was as happy as a king! I\r\nwent with it into the lime-kiln like a wolf to his lair, and then, with\r\nthe leave of the lime-burners, I made a glorious fry on the ashes. When\r\nthe burners were not at work, I picked up some dry wood at Romainville,\r\nset light to it, and broiled my steak under the walls of the bone-house.\r\nThe meat certainly was bloody, and almost raw, but that made a change."\r\n\r\n"And your name? What did they call you?" asked Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"I had hair much more flaxen than now, and the blood was always in my\r\neyes, and so they called me the \'Albino.\' The Albinos are the white\r\nrabbits amongst men; they have red eyes," added the Chourineur, in a\r\ngrave tone, and, as it were, with a physiological parenthesis.\r\n\r\n"And your relations? your family?"\r\n\r\n"My relations? Oh! they lodge at the same number as the Goualeuse\'s.\r\nPlace of my birth? Why, the first corner of no-matter-what street,\r\neither on the right or left-hand side of the way, and either going up or\r\ncoming down the kennel."\r\n\r\n"Then you have cursed your father and mother for having abandoned you?"\r\n\r\n"Why, that would not have set my leg if I had broken it! No matter;\r\nthough it\'s true they played me a scurvy trick in bringing me into the\r\nworld. But I should not have complained if they had made me as beggars\r\nought to be made; that is to say, without the sense of cold, hunger, or\r\nthirst. Beggars who don\'t like thieving would find it greatly to their\r\nadvantage."\r\n\r\n"You were cold, thirsty, hungry, Chourineur, and yet you did not steal?"\r\n\r\n"No; and yet I was horribly wretched. It\'s a fact, that I have often\r\ngone with an empty bread-basket (fasted) for two days at a time: that\r\nwas more than my share; but I never stole."\r\n\r\n"For fear of a gaol?"\r\n\r\n"Pooh!" said the Chourineur, shrugging his shoulders, and laughing\r\nloudly, "I should then not have stolen bread, for fear of getting my\r\nallowance, eh? An honest man, I was famishing; a thief, I should have\r\nbeen supported in prison, and right well, too! But I did not steal,\r\nbecause--because--why, because the idea of stealing never came across\r\nme; so that\'s all about it!"\r\n\r\nThis reply, noble as it was in itself, but of the rectitude of which the\r\nChourineur himself had no idea, perfectly astonished Rodolph. He felt\r\nthat the poor fellow who had remained honest in the midst of the most\r\ncruel privations was to be respected twofold, since the punishment of\r\nthe crime became a certain resource for him. Rodolph held out his hand\r\nto this ill-used savage of civilisation, whom misery had been unable\r\nwholly to corrupt. The Chourineur looked at his host in\r\nastonishment,--almost with respect; he hardly dared to touch the hand\r\ntendered to him. He felt impressed with some vague idea that there was a\r\nwide abyss between Rodolph and himself.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis well," said Rodolph to him, "you have heart and honour."\r\n\r\n"Heart? honour? what, I? Come, now, don\'t chaff me," he replied, with\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n"To suffer misery and hunger rather than steal, is to have heart and\r\nhonour," said Rodolph, gravely.\r\n\r\n"Well, it may be," said the Chourineur, as if thinking, "it may be so."\r\n\r\n"Does it astonish you?"\r\n\r\n"It really does; for people don\'t usually say such things to me; they\r\ngenerally treat me as they would a mangy dog. It\'s odd, though, the\r\neffect what you say has on me. Heart! honour!" he repeated, with an air\r\nwhich was actually pensive.\r\n\r\n"Well, what ails you?"\r\n\r\n"I\' faith, I don\'t know," replied the Chourineur, in a tone of emotion;\r\n"but these words, do you see, they quite make my heart beat; and I feel\r\nmore flattered than if any one told me I was a \'better man\' than either\r\nthe Skeleton or the Schoolmaster. I never felt anything like it before.\r\nBe sure, though, that these words, and the blows of the fist at the end\r\nof my tussle,--you did lay \'em on like a good \'un,--not alluding to what\r\nyou pay for the supper, and the words you have said--in a word," he\r\nexclaimed, bluntly, as if he could not find language to express his\r\nthoughts, "make sure that in life or death you may depend on the\r\nChourineur."\r\n\r\nRodolph, unwilling to betray his emotion, replied in a tone as calm as\r\nhe could assume, "How long did you go on as an amateur knacker?"\r\n\r\n"Why, at first, I was quite sick of cutting up old worn-out horses, who\r\ncould not even kick; but when I was about sixteen, and my voice began to\r\nget rough, it became a passion--a taste--a relish--a rage--with me to\r\ncut and slash. I did not care for anything but that; not even eating and\r\ndrinking. You should have seen me in the middle of my work! Except an\r\nold pair of woollen trousers, I was quite naked. When, with my large and\r\nwell-whetted knife in my hand, I had about me fifteen or twenty horses\r\nwaiting their turn, by Jupiter! when I began to slaughter them, I don\'t\r\nknow what possessed me,--I was like a fury. My ears had singing in them,\r\nand I saw everything _red_,--all was red; and I slashed, and slashed,\r\nand slashed, until my knife fell from my hands! Thunder! what happiness!\r\nHad I had millions, I could have paid them to have enjoyed my trade!"\r\n\r\n"It is that which has given you the habit of stabbing," said Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"Very likely; but when I was turned of sixteen, the passion became so\r\nstrong that when I once began slashing, I became mad; I spoiled my work;\r\nyes, I spoiled the skins, because I slashed and cut them across and\r\nacross; for I was so furious that I could not see clearly. At last they\r\nturned me out of the yard. I wanted employment with the butchers, for I\r\nhave always liked that sort of business. Well, they quite looked down\r\nupon me; they despised me as a shoemaker does a cobbler. Then I had to\r\nseek my bread elsewhere, and I didn\'t find it very readily; and this was\r\nthe time when my bread-basket was so often empty. At length I got\r\nemployment in the quarries at Montrouge; but, at the end of two years, I\r\nwas tired of going always around like a squirrel in his cage, and\r\ndrawing stone for twenty sous a day. I was tall and strong, and so I\r\nenlisted in a regiment. They asked my name, my age, and my papers. My\r\nname?--the Albino. My age?--look at my beard. My papers?--here\'s the\r\ncertificate of the master quarryman. As I was just the fellow for a\r\ngrenadier, they took me."\r\n\r\n"With your strength, courage, and taste for chopping and slashing, you\r\nought, in war-time, to have been made an officer."\r\n\r\n"Thunder and lightning! what do you say? What! to cut up English or\r\nPrussians! Why, that would have been better than to cut up old horses;\r\nbut, worse luck, there was no war, but a great deal of discipline. An\r\napprentice tries to hit his master a thump; well, if he be the weaker,\r\nwhy, he gets the worst of it; if he be the stronger, he has the best of\r\nit; he is turned out-of-doors, perhaps put into the cage,--and that is\r\nall. In the army it is quite a different thing. One day our sergeant had\r\nbullied me a good deal, to make me more attentive,--he was right, for I\r\nwas very slow; I did not like a poke he gave me, and I kicked at him; he\r\npushed me again, I returned his poke; he collared me, and I gave him a\r\npunch of the head. They fell on me, and then my blood was up in my eyes,\r\nand I was enraged in a moment. I had my knife in my hand--I belonged to\r\nthe cookery--and I \'went it my hardest.\' I cut, slashed,--slashed,\r\nchopped, as if I was in the slaughter-house. I made \'cold meat\' of the\r\nsergeant, wounded two soldiers,--it was a real shambles; I gave the\r\nthree eleven wounds,--yes, eleven. Blood flowed, flowed everywhere,\r\nblood, as though we were in the bone-house,--I swam in it--"\r\n\r\nThe brigand lowered his head with a sombre, sullen air, and was silent.\r\n\r\n"What are you thinking of, Chourineur?" asked Rodolph, with interest.\r\n\r\n"Nothing," he replied, abruptly; and then, with an air of brutish\r\ncarelessness, he added, "At length they handcuffed me, and brought me\r\nbefore the \'big wigs,\' and I was cast for death."\r\n\r\n"You escaped, however?"\r\n\r\n"True; but I had fifteen years at the galleys instead of being\r\n\'scragged.\' I forgot to tell you that whilst in the regiment I had saved\r\ntwo of my comrades from drowning in the Marne, when we were quartered at\r\nMilan. At another time,--you will laugh, and say I am amphibious either\r\nin fire or water when saving men or women,--at another time, being in\r\ngarrison at Rouen, all the wooden houses in one quarter were on fire,\r\nand burning like so many matches. I am the lad for a fire, and so I went\r\nto the place in an instant. They told me that there was an old woman who\r\nwas bedridden, and could not escape from her room, which was already in\r\nflames. I went towards it, and, by Jove! how it did burn; it reminded me\r\nof the lime-kilns in my happy days. However, I saved the old woman,\r\nalthough I had the very soles of my feet scorched. Thanks to my having\r\ndone these things, and the cunning of my advocate, my sentence was\r\nchanged, and, instead of being \'scragged,\' I was only sent to the hulks\r\nfor fifteen years. When I found that my life would be spared, and I was\r\nto go to the galleys, I would have jumped upon the babbling fool, and\r\ntwisted his neck, at the moment when he came to wish me joy, and to tell\r\nme he had saved my life, and be hanged to him! only they prevented me."\r\n\r\n"Were you sorry, then, to have your sentence commuted?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; for those who sport with the knife, the headsman\'s steel is the\r\nproper fate; for those who steal, the \'darbies\' to their heels: each his\r\nproper punishment. But to force you to live amongst galley-slaves, when\r\nyou have a right to be guillotined out of hand, is infamous; and,\r\nbesides, my life, when I first went to the Bagne, was rather queer; one\r\ndon\'t kill a man, and soon forget it, you must know."\r\n\r\n"You feel some remorse, then, Chourineur?"\r\n\r\n"Remorse? No; for I have served my time," said the savage; "but at\r\nfirst, a night did not pass but I saw--like a nightmare--the sergeant\r\nand soldiers whom I had slashed and slaughtered; that is, they were not\r\nalone," added the brigand, in a voice of terror; "these were in tens,\r\nand dozens, and hundreds, and thousands, each waiting his turn, in a\r\nkind of slaughter-house, like the horses whose throats I used to cut at\r\nMontfaucon, awaiting each his turn. Then, then, I saw _red_, and began\r\nto cut and slash away on these men as I used formerly to do on the\r\nhorses. The more, however, I chopped down the soldiers, the faster the\r\nranks filled up with others; and as they died, they looked at one with\r\nan air so gentle,--so gentle, that I cursed myself for killing \'em; but\r\nI couldn\'t help it. That was not all. I never had a brother; and yet it\r\nseemed as if every one of those whom I killed was my brother, and I\r\nloved all of them. At last, when I could bear it no longer, I used to\r\nwake covered all over with sweat, as cold as melting snow."\r\n\r\n"That was a horrid dream, Chourineur!"\r\n\r\n"It was; yes. That dream, do you see, was enough to drive one mad or\r\nfoolish; so, twice, I tried to kill myself, once by swallowing\r\nverdigris, and another time by trying to choke myself with my chain;\r\nbut, confound it, I am as strong as a bull. The verdigris only made me\r\nthirsty; and as for the twist of the chain round my neck, why, that\r\nonly gave me a natural cravat of a blue colour. Afterwards, the desire\r\nof life came back to me, nay nightmare ceased to torment me, and I did\r\nas others did."\r\n\r\n"At the Bagne, you were in a good school for learning how to thieve?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but it was not to my taste. The other \'prigs\' bullied me; but I\r\nsoon silenced them with a few thumps of my chain. It was in this way I\r\nfirst knew the Schoolmaster; and I must pay him the compliment due to\r\nhis blows,--he paid me off as you did some little time ago."\r\n\r\n"He is, then, a criminal who has served his time?"\r\n\r\n"He was sentenced for life, but escaped."\r\n\r\n"Escaped, and not denounced?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not the man to denounce him. Besides, it would seem as if I were\r\nafraid of him."\r\n\r\n"But how is it that the police do not detect him? Have they not got his\r\ndescription?"\r\n\r\n"His description? Oh! yes, yes; but it is long since he has scraped out\r\nfrom his phiz what nature had placed there; now, none but the \'baker who\r\nputs the condemned in his oven\' (the devil) could recognise him" (the\r\nSchoolmaster).\r\n\r\n"What has he done to himself?"\r\n\r\n"He began by destroying his nose, which was an ell long; he ate it off\r\nwith vitriol."\r\n\r\n"You jest."\r\n\r\n"If he comes in this evening, you\'ll see. He had a nose like a parrot,\r\nand now it is as flat as in a death\'s head; to say nothing of his lips,\r\nwhich are as thick as your fist, and his face, which is as wrinkled as\r\nthe waistcoat of a rag-picker."\r\n\r\n"And so he is not recognised?"\r\n\r\n"It is six months since he escaped from Rochefort, and the \'traps\' have\r\nmet him a hundred times without knowing him."\r\n\r\n"Why was he at the Bagne?"\r\n\r\n"For having been a forger, thief, and assassin. He is called the\r\nSchoolmaster because he wrote a splendid hand, and has had a good\r\neducation."\r\n\r\n"And is he much feared?"\r\n\r\n"He will not be any longer, when you have given him such a licking as\r\nyou gave me. Oh, by Jove, I am anxious to see it!"\r\n\r\n"What does he do for a living?"\r\n\r\n"He is associated with an old woman as bad as himself, and as deep as\r\nthe \'old one;\' but she is never seen, though he has told the ogress that\r\nsome day or other he would bring his \'mot\' (woman) with him."\r\n\r\n"And this women helps him in his robberies?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and in his murders too. They say he brags of having already, with\r\nher assistance, \'done for\' two or three persons; and, amongst others,\r\nthree weeks ago, a cattle-dealer on the road to Poissy, whom they also\r\nrobbed."\r\n\r\n"He will be taken sooner or later."\r\n\r\n"They must be very cunning, as well as powerful, to do that, for he\r\nalways has under his blouse a brace of loaded pistols and a dagger. He\r\nsays that Charlot (the executioner) waits for him, and he can only lose\r\nhis head once, and so he will kill all he can kill to try and escape.\r\nOh! he makes no mystery of it; and as he is twice as strong as you and\r\nI, they will have a tough job who take him."\r\n\r\n"What did you do, Chourineur, when you left the Bagne?"\r\n\r\n"I offered myself to the master-lighterman of the Quai St. Paul, and I\r\nget my livelihood there."\r\n\r\n"But as you have never been a \'prig,\' why do you live in the Cite?"\r\n\r\n"Why, where else can I live? Who likes to be seen with a discharged\r\ncriminal? I should be tired of always being alone, for I like company,\r\nand here I am with my equals. I have a bit of a row sometimes, and they\r\nfear me like fire in the Cite; but the police have nothing to say to\r\nme, except now and then for a \'shindy,\' for which they give me, perhaps,\r\ntwenty-four hours at the watch-house, and there\'s an end of that."\r\n\r\n"What do you earn a day?"\r\n\r\n"Thirty-five sous for taking in the river foot-baths, up to the stomach\r\nfrom twelve to fifteen hours a day, summer and winter; but let me be\r\njust, and tell the truth; so if, through having my toes in the water, I\r\nget the _grenouille_,[7] I am allowed to break my arms in breaking up\r\nold vessels, and unloading timber on my back. I begin as a beast of\r\nburden, and end like a fish\'s tail. When I lose my strength entirely, I\r\nshall take a rake and a wicker basket, like the old rag-picker whom I\r\nsee in the recollections of my childhood."\r\n\r\n  [7] A disease of the skin to which all who work in the water are\r\n  liable.\r\n\r\n"And yet you are not unhappy."\r\n\r\n"There are worse than I am; and without my dreams of the sergeant and\r\nsoldiers with their throats cut,--for I have the dream still\r\nsometimes,--I could quietly wait for the moment when I should drop down\r\ndead at the corner of some dunghill, like that at which I was born; but\r\nthe dream--the dream--by heaven and earth! I don\'t like even to think of\r\nthat," said the Chourineur, and he emptied his pipe at the corner of the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nThe Goualeuse had hardly listened to the Chourineur; she seemed wholly\r\nabsorbed in a deep and melancholy reverie. Rodolph himself was pensive.\r\nA tragic incident occurred, which brought these three personages to a\r\nrecollection of the spot in which they were.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE ARREST.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man who had gone out for a moment, after having requested the ogress\r\nto look after his jug and plate, soon returned, accompanied by a tall,\r\nbrawny man, to whom he said, "It was a chance to meet in this way, old\r\nfellow! Come in, and let us have a glass together."\r\n\r\nThe Chourineur said, in a low voice, to Rodolph and the Goualeuse,\r\npointing to the newcomer, "We shall have a row. He\'s a \'trap.\' Look out\r\nfor squalls."\r\n\r\nThe two ruffians, one of whom, with the Greek skull-cap pulled over his\r\nbrows, had inquired several times for the Schoolmaster and the\r\nGros-Boiteux, exchanged rapid glances of the eye, and, rising suddenly\r\nfrom the table, went towards the door; but the two police officers,\r\nuttering a peculiar note, seized them. A fierce struggle ensued. The\r\ndoor of the tavern opened, and all of the policemen dashed into the\r\nroom, whilst, outside, were seen the muskets of the _gens-d\'armes_.\r\nTaking advantage of the tumult, the charcoal-seller, of whom we have\r\nspoken, advanced to the threshold of the _tapis-franc_, and, meeting the\r\neye of Rodolph, he put to his lips the forefinger of his right hand.\r\nRodolph, with a gesture as rapid as it was imperious, desired him to go,\r\nand then turned his attention to the scene before him. The man with the\r\nGreek skull-cap shrieked with rage, and, half extended on a table,\r\nstruggled so desperately, that three men could scarcely hold him. His\r\ncompanion, enfeebled, dejected, with livid aspect and pale lips, his\r\nlower jaw fallen, and shaking convulsively, made no resistance, but\r\nheld out his hands to be enclasped by the handcuffs. The ogress, seated\r\nat her bar, and used to such scenes, remained motionless, with her hands\r\nin the pockets of her apron.\r\n\r\n"What have these fellows done, my dear M. Narcisse Borel?" inquired she\r\nof one of the policemen whom she knew.\r\n\r\n"Killed an old woman yesterday in the Rue St. Christophe, and robbed her\r\nchamber. Before she died, the poor old thing said that she had bitten\r\none of her murderers in the hand. We had our eyes on these two\r\nscoundrels; and my comrade, having come to make sure of his men, why, we\r\nhave made free to take them."\r\n\r\n"How lucky they paid me beforehand for their pint!" said the ogress.\r\n"Won\'t you take a dram o\' nothin\' \'short,\' M. Narcisse? Just a \'go\' of\r\n\'Ratifi\' of the Column.\'"\r\n\r\n"Thanks, Mother Ponisse, but I must make sure of my game; one fellow\r\nshows fight still."\r\n\r\nThe assassin in the Greek cap was furious with rage, and when they tried\r\nto get him into a hackney-coach which was waiting in the street, he\r\nresisted so stoutly that they were obliged to carry him. His accomplice,\r\nseized with a nervous tremor, could hardly support himself, and his blue\r\nlips trembled as though he were speaking. They threw him, helpless and\r\nunresisting, into the vehicle. Before he left the _tapis-franc_, the\r\nhead officer looked attentively at the other guests assembled, and said\r\nto the Chourineur, in a tone almost kind:\r\n\r\n"What, you here, you bad lot? Why, it is a long time since we heard\r\nanything of you. What, no more rows? Are you growing steady?"\r\n\r\n"Steady as a stone figure. Why, you know that now I never break a head,\r\neven if I am begged to do so!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t think that would cost you much trouble, strong as you\r\nare."\r\n\r\n"Yet here is my master," said the Chourineur, laying his hand on\r\nRodolph\'s shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Stay, I do not know him," said the _agent de police_, looking\r\nsteadfastly at Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"And I do not think we shall form an acquaintance now," replied he.\r\n\r\n"I hope not, for your sake, my fine fellow," said the agent; then,\r\nturning to the ogress, "Good night, Mother Ponisse; your _tapis-franc_\r\nis a regular mouse-trap; this is the third assassin I have taken here."\r\n\r\n"I hope it won\'t be the last, M. Narcisse; it is quite at your service,"\r\nsaid the ogress, making a very insinuating nod with her head.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of the police, the young vagabond with the haggard\r\nvisage, who was smoking and drinking brandy, refilled his pipe, and said\r\nin a hoarse voice to the Chourineur:\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you \'twig\' the \'cove\' in the Greek cap? He\'s Boulotte\'s man.\r\nWhen I saw the traps walk in, I says to myself, says I, there\'s\r\nsomething up; and then, too, I saw him keep his hand always under the\r\ntable."\r\n\r\n"It\'s lucky for the Schoolmaster and Gros-Boiteux that they were not\r\nhere," said the ogress; "Greek cap asked twice for him, and said they\r\nhad business together; but I never turn \'nose\' (informer) on any\r\ncustomer. If they take them, very well,--every one to his trade; but I\r\nnever sell my friends. Oh, talk of the old gentleman, and you see his\r\nhorns," added the hag, as at the moment a man and woman entered the\r\ncabaret; "here they are,--the Schoolmaster and his companion. Well, he\r\nwas right not to show her, for I never see such an ugly creetur in my\r\nborn days. She ought to be very much obliged to him for having taken up\r\nwith such a face."\r\n\r\nAt the name of the Schoolmaster, a sort of shudder seemed to circulate\r\namongst the guests of the _tapis-franc_. Rodolph, himself, in spite of\r\nhis natural intrepidity, could not wholly subdue a slight emotion at the\r\nsight of this redoubtable ruffian, whom he contemplated for some\r\nseconds with a mixed feeling of curiosity and horror. The Chourineur had\r\nspoken truth when he said that the Schoolmaster was frightfully\r\nmutilated. Nothing can be imagined more horrible than the countenance of\r\nthis man. His face was furrowed in all directions with deep, livid\r\ncicatrices; the corrosive action of the vitriol had puffed out his lips;\r\nthe cartilages of his nose were divided, and two misshapen holes\r\nsupplied the loss of nostrils. His gray eyes were bright, small,\r\ncircular, and sparkled savagely; his forehead, as flat as a tiger\'s, was\r\nhalf hidden beneath a fur cap, with long yellow hair, looking like the\r\ncrest of a monster.\r\n\r\nThe Schoolmaster was not more than five feet four or five; his head,\r\nwhich was disproportionately large, was buried between two shoulders,\r\nbroad, powerful, and fleshy, displaying themselves even under the loose\r\nfolds of his coarse cotton blouse; he had long, muscular arms, hands\r\nshort, thick, and hairy to the very fingers\' end, with legs somewhat\r\nbowed, whose enormous calves betokened his vast strength. This man\r\npresented, in fact, the exaggeration of what there is of short,\r\nthickset, and condensed, in the type of the Hercules Farnese. As to the\r\nexpression of ferocity which suffused this hideous mask, and the\r\nrestless, wild, and glaring look, more like a wild beast than a human\r\nbeing, it is impossible to describe them.\r\n\r\nThe woman who accompanied the Schoolmaster was old, and rather neatly\r\ndressed in a brown gown, with a plaid shawl, of red and black check, and\r\na white bonnet. Rodolph saw her profile, and her green eye, hooked nose,\r\nskinny lips, peaked chin, and countenance at once wicked and cunning,\r\nreminded him involuntarily of La Chouette, that horrible old wretch who\r\nhad made poor Fleur-de-Marie her victim. He was just on the point of\r\nsaying this to the girl, when he saw her suddenly turn pale with fright,\r\nwhilst looking at the hideous companion of the Schoolmaster, and\r\nseizing the arm of Rodolph with a trembling hand, the Goualeuse said, in\r\na low voice:\r\n\r\n"Oh, the Chouette! the Chouette!--the one-eyed woman!"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the Schoolmaster, after having exchanged a few words in\r\nan undertone with Barbillon, came slowly towards the table where\r\nRodolph, the Goualeuse, and the Chourineur were sitting, and addressing\r\nhimself to Fleur-de-Marie, in a hoarse voice, said:\r\n\r\n"Ah, my pretty, fair miss, you must quit these two \'muffs,\' and come\r\nwith me."\r\n\r\nThe Goualeuse made no reply, but clung to Rodolph, her teeth chattering\r\nwith fright.\r\n\r\n"And I shall not be jealous of my man, my little _fourline_" (a pet word\r\nfor assassin), added the Chouette, laughing loudly. She had not yet\r\nrecognised in Goualeuse "Pegriotte," her old victim.\r\n\r\n"Well, my little white face, dost hear me?" said the monster, advancing.\r\n"If thou dost not come, I\'ll poke your eye out, and make you a match for\r\nthe Chouette. And thou with the moustache," he said to Rodolph, "if thou\r\ndost not stand from between me and the wench, I\'ll crack thy crown."\r\n\r\n"Defend me! oh, defend me!" cried Fleur-de-Marie to Rodolph, clasping\r\nher hands. Then, reflecting that she was about to expose him to great\r\ndanger, she added, in a low voice, "No, no, do not move, Mister Rodolph;\r\nif he comes nearer, I will cry out for help, and for fear of the\r\ndisturbance, which may call in the police, the ogress will take my\r\npart."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be alarmed, my child," said Rodolph, looking calmly at the\r\nSchoolmaster; "you are beside me,--don\'t stir; and as this ill-looking\r\nscoundrel makes you as well as myself feel uncomfortable, I will kick\r\nhim out."\r\n\r\n"Thou?" said the Schoolmaster.\r\n\r\n"I!" said Rodolph. And, in spite of the efforts of the Goualeuse, he\r\nrose from the table. Despite his hardihood, the Schoolmaster retreated a\r\nstep, so threatening were the looks, so commanding the deportment, of\r\nRodolph. There are peculiar glances of the eye which are irresistible,\r\nand certain celebrated duellists are said to owe their bloody triumphs\r\nto this fascinating glance, which unmans, paralyses, and destroys their\r\nadversaries. The Schoolmaster trembled, retreated a step, and, for once,\r\ndistrustful of his giant strength, felt under his blouse for his long\r\ncut-and-thrust knife. A murder would have stained the _tapis-franc_, no\r\ndoubt, if the Chouette, taking the Schoolmaster by the arm, had not\r\nscreamed out:\r\n\r\n"A minute, a minute, _fourline_,--let me say a word! You shall walk into\r\nthese two \'muffs\' all the same, presently."\r\n\r\nThe Schoolmaster looked at her with astonishment. For some minutes she\r\nhad been looking at Fleur-de-Marie with fixed and increasing attention,\r\nas if trying to refresh her memory. At length no doubt remained, and she\r\nrecognised the Goualeuse.\r\n\r\n"Is it possible?" she cried, clasping her hands in astonishment. "It is\r\nPegriotte, who stole my barley-sugar. But where do you come from? Is it\r\nthe devil who sends you back?" and she shook her clenched hand at the\r\nyoung girl. "You won\'t come into my clutch again, eh? But be easy; if I\r\ndo not pull out your teeth, I will have out of your eyes every tear in\r\nyour body. Come, no airs and graces. You don\'t know what I mean. Why, I\r\nhave found out the people who had the care of you before you were handed\r\nover to me. The Schoolmaster saw at the _Pre_ (the galleys) the man who\r\nbrought you to my \'crib\' when you were a brat, and he has proofs that\r\nthe people who had you first were \'gentry coves\'" (rich people).\r\n\r\n"My parents! Do you know them?" cried Fleur-de-Marie.\r\n\r\n"Never mind whether I know them or not, you shall know nothing about it.\r\nThe secret is mine and my _fourline\'s_, and I will tear out his tongue\r\nrather than he shall blab it. What! it makes you snivel, does it,\r\nPegriotte?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Goualeuse, with a bitterness of accent; "_now_ I do not\r\ncare ever to know my parents."\r\n\r\nWhilst La Chouette was speaking, the Schoolmaster had resumed his\r\nassurance, for, looking at Rodolph, he could not believe that a young\r\nman of slight and graceful make could for a moment cope with him, and,\r\nconfident in his brutal force, he approached the defender of Goualeuse,\r\nand said to the Chouette, in an imperious voice:\r\n\r\n"Hold your jaw! I\'ll tackle with this swell, and then the fair lady may\r\nthink me more to her fancy than he is."\r\n\r\nWith one bound Rodolph leaped on the table.\r\n\r\n"Take care of my plates!" shouted the ogress.\r\n\r\nThe Schoolmaster stood on his guard, his two hands in front, his chest\r\nadvanced, firmly planted on his legs, and arched, as it were, on his\r\nbrawny legs, which were like balusters of stone. At the moment when\r\nRodolph was springing at him, the door of the _tapis-franc_ opened with\r\nviolence, and the charcoal-man, of whom we have before spoken, and who\r\nwas upwards of six feet high, dashed into the apartment, pushed the\r\nSchoolmaster on one side rudely, and coming up to Rodolph, said, in\r\nGerman, in his ear:\r\n\r\n"Monseigneur, the countess and her brother--they are at the end of the\r\nstreet."\r\n\r\nAt these words Rodolph made an impatient and angry gesture, threw a\r\nlouis d\'or on the bar of the ogress, and made for the door in haste. The\r\nSchoolmaster attempted to arrest Rodolph\'s progress, but he, turning to\r\nhim, gave him two or three rapid blows with his fists over the nose and\r\neyes, and with such potent effect, that the beast staggered with very\r\ngiddiness, and fell heavily against a table, which alone prevented his\r\nprostration on the floor.\r\n\r\n"_Vive la Charte!_ those are _my_ blows,--I know them," cried the\r\nChourineur; "two or three more lessons like that, and I shall know all\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\nRestored to himself after a few moments, the Schoolmaster darted off in\r\npursuit of Rodolph, but he had disappeared with the charcoal-man in the\r\ndark labyrinth of the streets of the Cite, and the brigand found it\r\nuseless to follow.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when the Schoolmaster had returned, foaming with rage, two\r\npersons, approaching from the opposite side to that by which Rodolph had\r\ndisappeared, entered into the _tapis-franc_, hastily, and out of breath,\r\nas if they had been running far and fast. Their first impulse was to\r\nlook around the room.\r\n\r\n"How unfortunate!" said one of them; "he has gone,--another opportunity\r\nlost."\r\n\r\nThe two newcomers spoke in English. The Goualeuse, horror-struck at\r\nmeeting with the Chouette, and dreading the threats of the Schoolmaster,\r\ntook advantage of the tumult and confusion caused by the arrival of the\r\ntwo fresh guests in the _tapis-franc_, and, quietly gliding out by the\r\nhalf-opened door, left the cabaret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS SEYTON AND THE COUNTESS SARAH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two persons who had just entered the _tapis-franc_ were quite of\r\nanother class from those who ordinarily frequented it. One, tall and\r\nerect, had hair almost white, black eyebrows and whiskers, a long and\r\ntanned face, with a stiff, formal air. His long frock coat was buttoned\r\nup to the throat, _a la militaire_. We shall call this individual Thomas\r\nSeyton. His companion was young, pale, and handsome, and appeared about\r\nthirty-one or two years of age. His hair, eyebrows, and eyes were of a\r\ndeep black, which showed off the more fully the pure whiteness of his\r\nface. By his step, the smallness of his stature, and the delicacy of his\r\nfeatures, it was easy to detect a woman in male habiliments. This female\r\nwas the Countess Sarah Macgregor. We will hereafter inform our readers\r\nof the motives and events which had brought the countess and her brother\r\ninto this cabaret of the Cite.\r\n\r\n"Call for something to drink, Thomas, and ask the people here about\r\n_him_; perhaps they may give us some information," said Sarah, still\r\nspeaking English.\r\n\r\nThe man with white hair and black eyebrows sat down at a table, whilst\r\nSarah was wiping her forehead, and said to the ogress, in excellent\r\nFrench, "Madame, let us have something to drink, if you please."\r\n\r\nThe entrance of these two persons into the _tapis-franc_ had excited\r\nuniversal attention. Their dress, their manners, all announced that they\r\nnever frequented low drinking-shops, whilst, by their restless looks\r\nand disturbed countenances, it might be judged that some very powerful\r\nmotives had led them hither. The Chourineur, the Schoolmaster, and the\r\nChouette viewed them with increasing curiosity.\r\n\r\nStartled by the appearance of such strange customers, the ogress shared\r\nin the general surprise. Thomas Seyton, a second time, and with an\r\nimpatient tone, said, "We have called for something to drink, ma\'am;\r\npray let us have it."\r\n\r\nMother Ponisse, flattered by their courtesy of manner, left her bar,\r\nand, coming towards her new guests, leaned her arms on their table, and\r\nsaid, "Will you have a pint of wine in measure or a bottle?"\r\n\r\n"A bottle of wine, glasses, and some water."\r\n\r\nThe ogress brought the supplies demanded, and Thomas Seyton threw her a\r\nfive-franc piece, and refused the change which she offered to him.\r\n\r\n"Keep it, my good woman, for yourself, and perhaps you will take a glass\r\nwith us."\r\n\r\n"You\'re uncommon purlite, sir," looking at the countess\'s brother with\r\nas much surprise as gratitude.\r\n\r\n"But tell me, now," said he; "we had appointed to meet a friend in a\r\ncabaret in this street, and have, perhaps, mistaken the house in coming\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"This is the \'White Rabbit,\' at your service, sir."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right enough, then," said Thomas, making a sign to Sarah; "yes,\r\nit was at the \'White Rabbit\' that he was to give us the meeting."\r\n\r\n"There are not two \'White Rabbits\' in this street," said the ogress,\r\nwith a toss of her head. "But what sort of a person was your friend?"\r\n\r\n"Tall, slim, and with hair and moustaches of light chestnut," said\r\nSeyton.\r\n\r\n"Exactly, exactly; that\'s the man who has just gone out. A charcoal-man,\r\nvery tall and stout, came in and said a few words to him, and they left\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\n"The very man we want to meet," said Tom.\r\n\r\n"Were they alone here?" inquired Sarah.\r\n\r\n"Why, the charcoal-man only came in for one moment; but your comrade\r\nsupped here with the Chourineur and Goualeuse;" and with a nod of her\r\nhead, the ogress pointed out the individual of the party who was left\r\nstill in the cabaret.\r\n\r\nThomas and Sarah turned towards the Chourineur. After contemplating him\r\nfor a few minutes, Sarah said, in English, to her companion, "Do you\r\nknow this man?"\r\n\r\n"No; Karl lost all trace of Rodolph at the entrance of these obscure\r\nstreets. Seeing Murphy disguised as a charcoal-seller, keeping watch\r\nabout this cabaret, and constantly peeping through the windows, he was\r\nafraid that something wrong was going on, and so came to warn us.\r\nMurphy, no doubt, recognised him."\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation, held in a very low tone, and in a foreign\r\ntongue, the Schoolmaster said to the Chouette, looking at Tom and Sarah,\r\n"The swell has shelled out a \'bull\' to the ogress. It is just twelve,\r\nrains and blows like the devil. When they leave the \'crib,\' we will be\r\non their \'lay,\' and draw the \'flat\' of his \'blunt.\' As his \'mot\' is with\r\nhim, he\'ll hold his jaw."\r\n\r\nIf Tom and Sarah had heard this foul language, they would not have\r\nunderstood it, and would not have detected the plot against them.\r\n\r\n"Be quiet, _fourline_," answered the Chouette; "if the \'cull\' sings out\r\nfor the \'traps,\' I have my vitriol in my pocket, and will break the\r\nphial in his \'patter-box.\' Nothing like a drink to keep children from\r\ncrying," she added. "Tell me, darling, sha\'n\'t we lay hands on Pegriotte\r\nthe first time we meet with her? And only let me once get her to our\r\nplace, and I\'ll rub her chops with my vitriol, and then my lady will no\r\nlonger be proud of her fine skin."\r\n\r\n"Well said, Chouette; I shall make you my wife some day or other," said\r\nthe Schoolmaster; "you have no equal for skill and courage. On that\r\nnight with the cattle-dealer, I had an opportunity of judging of you;\r\nand I said, \'Here\'s the wife for me; she works better than a man.\'"\r\n\r\n"And you said right, _fourline_; if the Skeleton had had a woman like me\r\nat his elbow, he would not have been nabbed with his gully in the dead\r\nman\'s weasand."\r\n\r\n"He\'s done up, and now he will not leave the \'stone jug,\' except to kiss\r\nthe headsman\'s daughter, and be a head shorter."\r\n\r\n"What strange language these people talk!" said Sarah, who had\r\ninvoluntarily heard the last few words of the conversation between the\r\nSchoolmaster and the Chouette. Then she added, pointing to the\r\nChourineur, "If we ask this man some questions about Rodolph, perhaps he\r\nmay be able to answer them."\r\n\r\n"We can but try," replied Thomas, who said to the Chourineur, "Comrade,\r\nwe expected to find in this cabaret a friend of ours; he supped with\r\nyou, I find. Perhaps, as you know him, you will tell us which way he has\r\ngone?"\r\n\r\n"I know him because he gave me a precious good hiding two hours ago, to\r\nprevent me from beating Goualeuse."\r\n\r\n"And have you never seen him before?"\r\n\r\n"Never; we met by chance in the alley which leads to Bras Rouge\'s\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\n"Hostess, another bottle of the best," said Thomas Seyton.\r\n\r\nSarah and he had hardly moistened their lips, and their glasses were\r\nstill full; but Mother Ponisse, doubtless anxious to pay proper respect\r\nto her own cellar, had frequently filled and emptied hers.\r\n\r\n"And put it on the table where that gentleman sits, if he will permit,"\r\nadded Thomas, who, with Sarah, seated themselves beside the Chourineur,\r\nwho was as much astonished as flattered by such politeness.\r\n\r\nThe Schoolmaster and the Chouette were talking over their own dark plans\r\nin low tones and "flash" language. The bottle being brought, and Sarah\r\nand her brother seated with the Chourineur and the ogress, who had\r\nconsidered a second invitation as superfluous, the conversation was\r\nresumed.\r\n\r\n"You told us, my good fellow, that you met our comrade Rodolph in the\r\nhouse where Bras Rouge lives?" inquired Thomas Seyton, as he hob and\r\nnobbed with the Chourineur.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my good fellow," replied he, as he emptied his glass at a gulp.\r\n\r\n"What a singular name is Bras Rouge! What is this Bras Rouge?"\r\n\r\n"_Il pastique la maltouze_" (smuggles), said the Chourineur, in a\r\ncareless tone, and then added, "This is jolly good wine, Mother\r\nPonisse!"\r\n\r\n"If you think so, do not spare it, my fine fellow," said Seyton, and he\r\nfilled the Chourineur\'s glass as he spoke.\r\n\r\n"Your health, mate," said he, "and the health of your little friend,\r\nwho--but mum. \'If my aunt was a man, she\'d be my uncle,\' as the proverb\r\nsays. Ah! you sly rogue, I\'m up to you!"\r\n\r\nSarah coloured slightly as her brother continued, "I did not quite\r\nunderstand what you meant about Bras Rouge. Rodolph came from his house,\r\nno doubt?"\r\n\r\n"I told you that Bras Rouge _pastique la maltouze_."\r\n\r\nThomas regarded the Chourineur with an air of surprise.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by _pastique la mal_--What do you call it?"\r\n\r\n"_Pastiquer la maltouze._ He smuggles, I suppose you would call it; but\r\nit seems you can\'t \'patter flash?\'"\r\n\r\n"My fine fellow, I don\'t understand one word you say."\r\n\r\n"I see you can\'t talk slang like M. Rodolph."\r\n\r\n"Slang?" said Thomas Seyton, looking at Sarah with an astonished air.\r\n\r\n"Ah! you are yokels; but comrade Rodolph is an out-and-out pal, he is.\r\nThough only a fan-painter, yet he is as \'downy\' in \'flash\' as I am\r\nmyself. Well, since you can\'t speak this very fine language, I tell you,\r\nin plain French, that Bras Rouge is a smuggler, and, besides that, has a\r\nsmall tavern in the Champs Elysees. I say, without breaking faith, that\r\nhe is a smuggler, for he makes no secret of it, but owns it under the\r\nvery nose of the custom-house officers. Find him out, though, if you\r\ncan; Bras Rouge is a deep one."\r\n\r\n"What could Rodolph want at the house of this man?" asked Sarah.\r\n\r\n"Really, sir, or madam, which you please, I know nothing about anything,\r\nas true as I drink this glass of wine. I was chaffing to-night with the\r\nGoualeuse, who thought I was going to beat her, and she ran up Bras\r\nRouge\'s alley, and I after her; it was as dark as the devil. Instead of\r\nhitting Goualeuse, however, I stumbled on Master Rodolph, who soon gave\r\nme better than I sent. Such thumps! and especially those infernal\r\nthwacks with his fist at last. My eyes! how hot and heavy they did fall!\r\nBut he\'s promised to teach me, and to--"\r\n\r\n"And Bras Rouge, what sort of a person is he?" asked Tom. "What goods\r\ndoes he sell?"\r\n\r\n"Bras Rouge? Oh, by the Holy! he sells everything he is forbidden to\r\nsell, and does everything which it is forbidden to do. That\'s his line,\r\nain\'t it, Mother Ponisse?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! he\'s a boy with more than one string to his bow," answered the\r\nogress. "He is, besides, principal occupier of a certain house in the\r\nRue du Temple,--a rum sort of a house, to be sure; but mum," added she,\r\nfearing to have revealed too much.\r\n\r\n"And what is the address of Bras Rouge in that street?" asked Seyton of\r\nthe Chourineur.\r\n\r\n"No. 13, sir."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps we may learn something there," said Seyton, in a low voice, to\r\nhis sister. "I will send Karl thither to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"As you know M. Rodolph," said the Chourineur, "you may boast the\r\nacquaintance of a stout friend and a good fellow. If it had not been for\r\nthe charcoal-man, he would have \'doubled up\' the Schoolmaster, who is\r\nthere in the corner with the Chouette. By the Lord! I can hardly contain\r\nmyself, when I see that old hag, and know how she behaved to the\r\nGoualeuse,--but patience, \'a blow delayed is not a blow lost,\' as the\r\nsaying is."\r\n\r\nThe Hotel de Ville clock struck midnight; the lamp of the tavern only\r\nshed a dim and flickering light. Except the Chourineur and his two\r\ncompanions, the Schoolmaster, and the Screech-owl, all the guests of the\r\n_tapis-franc_ had retired one after the other.\r\n\r\nThe Schoolmaster said, in an undertone, to the Chouette, "If we go and\r\nhide in the alley opposite, we shall see the swells come out, and know\r\nwhich road they take. If they turn to the left, we can double upon them\r\nat the turning of the Rue Saint Eloi; if to the right, we will wait for\r\nthem by the ruins close to the tripe-market. There\'s a large hole close\r\nby, and I have a capital idea."\r\n\r\nThe Schoolmaster and the Chouette then went towards the door.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t, then, take a \'drain\' of nothin\' to-night?" said the ogress.\r\n\r\n"No, Mother Ponisse, we only came in to take shelter from the rain,"\r\nsaid the Schoolmaster, as he and the Chouette went out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n"YOUR MONEY OR YOUR LIFE."\r\n\r\n\r\nThe noise which was made by the shutting of the door aroused Tom and\r\nSarah from their reverie, and they rose, and, having thanked the\r\nChourineur for the information he had given them, the fellow went out,\r\nthe wind blowing very strongly, and the rain falling in torrents. The\r\nSchoolmaster and the Chouette, hidden in an alley opposite the\r\n_tapis-franc_, saw the Chourineur go down the street, in the direction\r\nof the street in which the house in ruins was situated. His steps, which\r\nwere somewhat irregular, in consequence of the frequent libations of the\r\nevening, were soon unheard amidst the whistling of the storm and the\r\nsheets of rain which dashed against the walls. Sarah and Tom left the\r\ntavern in spite of the tempest, and took a contrary direction to the\r\nChourineur.\r\n\r\n"They\'re done for," said the Schoolmaster, in a low key, to the\r\nChouette; "out with your vitriol, and mind your eye."\r\n\r\n"Let us take off our shoes, and then they won\'t hear us as we follow,"\r\nsuggested the Chouette.\r\n\r\n"You are right,--always right; let us tread like cats, my old darling."\r\n\r\nThe two monsters took off their shoes, and moved stealthily along,\r\nkeeping in the shadows of the houses. By means of this stratagem they\r\nfollowed so closely, that, although within a few steps of Sarah and Tom,\r\nthey did not hear them.\r\n\r\n"Fortunately our hackney-coach is at the end of the street; the rain\r\nfalls in torrents. Are you not cold, Sarah?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps we shall glean something from this smuggler,--this Bras Rouge,"\r\nsaid Sarah, in a thoughtful tone, and not replying to her brother\'s\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nHe suddenly stopped, and said, "I have taken a wrong turning; I ought to\r\nhave gone to the right when I left the tavern; we must pass by a house\r\nin ruins to reach the _fiacre_. We must turn back."\r\n\r\nThe Schoolmaster and the Chouette, who followed on the heels of their\r\nintended victims, retreated into the dark porch of a house close at\r\nhand, so that they might not be perceived by Tom and Sarah, who, in\r\npassing, almost touched them with their elbows.\r\n\r\n"I am glad they have gone that way," said the Schoolmaster, "for if the\r\n\'cove\' resists, I have my own idea."\r\n\r\nSarah and her brother, having again passed by the _tapis-franc_, arrived\r\nclose to the dilapidated house, which was partly in ruins, and its\r\nopened cellars formed a kind of gulf, along which the street ran in that\r\ndirection. In an instant, the Schoolmaster, with a leap resembling in\r\nstrength and agility the spring of a tiger, seized Seyton with one hand\r\nby the throat, and exclaimed, "Your money, or I will fling you into this\r\nhole!"\r\n\r\nThen the brigand, pushing Seyton backwards, shoved him off his balance,\r\nand with one hand held him suspended over the mouth of the deep\r\nexcavation; whilst, with his other hand, he grasped the arm of Sarah, as\r\nif in a vice. Before Tom could make the slightest struggle, the Chouette\r\nhad emptied his pockets with singular dexterity. Sarah did not utter a\r\ncry, nor try to resist; she only said, in a calm tone, "Give up your\r\npurse, brother;" and then accosting the robber, "We will make no noise;\r\ndo not do us any injury."\r\n\r\nThe Chouette, having carefully searched the pockets of the two victims\r\nof this ambush, said to Sarah, "Let\'s see your hands, if you\'ve got any\r\nrings. No," said the old brute, grumblingly, "no, not one ring. What a\r\nshame!"\r\n\r\nTom Seyton did not lose his presence of mind during this scene, rapidly\r\nand unexpectedly as it had occurred.\r\n\r\n"Will you strike a bargain? My pocketbook contains papers quite useless\r\nto you; return it to me, and to-morrow I will give you twenty-five louis\r\nd\'ors," said Tom to the Schoolmaster, whose hand relaxed something of\r\nits fierce gripe.\r\n\r\n"Oh! ah! to lay a trap to catch us," replied the thief. "Be off, without\r\nlooking behind you, and be thankful that you have escaped so well."\r\n\r\n"One moment," said the Chouette; "if he behaves well, he shall have his\r\npocketbook. There is a way." Then, addressing Thomas Seyton, "You know\r\nthe plain of St. Denis?"\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"Do you know where St. Ouen is?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Opposite St. Ouen, at the end of the road of La Revolte, the plain is\r\nwide and open. Across the fields, one may see a long way. Come there\r\nto-morrow, quite alone, with your money in your hand; you will find me\r\nand the pocketbook ready. Hand me the cash, and I will hand you the\r\npocketbook."\r\n\r\n"But he\'ll trap you, Chouette."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, he won\'t; I\'m up to him or any of his dodges. We can see a long\r\nway off. I have only one eye, but that is a piercer; and if the \'cove\'\r\ncomes with a companion, he won\'t find anybody; I shall have \'mizzled.\'"\r\n\r\nA sudden idea seemed to strike Sarah, and she said to the brigand, "Will\r\nyou like to gain some money?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Did you see, in the cabaret we have just left--for I know you\r\nagain--the man whom the charcoal-man came to seek?"\r\n\r\n"A dandy with moustaches? Yes, I would have stuck it into the fellow,\r\nbut he did not give me time. He stunned me with two blows of his fists,\r\nand upset me on the table,--for the first time that any man ever did so.\r\nCurses on him! but I will be revenged."\r\n\r\n"He is the man I mean," said Sarah.\r\n\r\n"He?" cried the Schoolmaster, "a thousand francs, and I\'ll kill him."\r\n\r\n"Wretch! I do not seek his life," replied Sarah to the Schoolmaster.\r\n\r\n"What, then, would you have?"\r\n\r\n"Come to-morrow to the plain of St. Denis; you will there find my\r\ncompanion," she replied; "you will see that he is alone, and he will\r\ntell you what to do. I will not give you one thousand, but two thousand,\r\nfrancs, if you succeed."\r\n\r\n"_Fourline_," said the Chouette, in a low tone, to the Schoolmaster,\r\n"there\'s \'blunt\' to be had; these are a \'swell\' lot, who want to be\r\nrevenged on an enemy, and that enemy is the beggar that you wished to\r\n\'floor.\' Let\'s go and meet him. I would go, if I were you. Fire and\r\nsmoke! Old boy, it will pay for looking after."\r\n\r\n"Well, my wife shall be there," said the Schoolmaster; "you will tell\r\nher what you want, and I shall see--"\r\n\r\n"Be it so; to-morrow at one."\r\n\r\n"At one o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"In the plain of St. Denis?"\r\n\r\n"In the plain of St. Denis."\r\n\r\n"Between St. Ouen and the road of La Revolte, at the end of the road?"\r\n\r\n"Agreed."\r\n\r\n"I will bring your pocketbook."\r\n\r\n"And you shall have the five hundred francs I promised you, and we will\r\nagree in the other matter, if you are reasonable."\r\n\r\n"Now, you go to the right, and we to the left hand. Do not follow us, or\r\nelse--"\r\n\r\nThe Schoolmaster and the Chouette hurried off, whilst Tom and the\r\ncountess went in the other direction, towards Notre Dame.\r\n\r\nA concealed witness had been present at this transaction; it was the\r\nChourineur, who had entered the cellars of the house to get shelter from\r\nthe rain. The proposal which Sarah made to the brigand respecting\r\nRodolph deeply interested the Chourineur, who, alarmed for the perils\r\nwhich appeared about to beset his new friend, regretted that he could\r\nnot warn him of them. Perhaps his detestation of the Schoolmaster and\r\nthe Chouette might have something to do with this feeling.\r\n\r\nThe Chourineur resolved to inform Rodolph of the danger which threatened\r\nhim; but how? He had forgotten the address of the self-styled\r\nfan-painter. Perhaps Rodolph would never again come to the\r\n_tapis-franc_, and then how could he warn him? Whilst he was conning all\r\nthis over in his mind, the Chourineur had mechanically followed Tom and\r\nSarah, and saw them get into a coach which awaited them near Notre Dame.\r\n\r\nThe _fiacre_ started. The Chourineur got up behind, and at one o\'clock\r\nit stopped on the Boulevard de l\'Observatoire, and Thomas and Sarah went\r\ndown a narrow entrance, which was close at hand. The night was pitch\r\ndark, and the Chourineur, that he might know the next day the place\r\nwhere he then was, drew from his pocket his clasp-knife, and cut a deep\r\nnotch in one of the trees at the corner of the entrance, and then\r\nreturned to his resting-place, which was at a considerable distance.\r\n\r\nFor the first time for a very long while, the Chourineur enjoyed in his\r\nden a comfortable sleep, which was not once interrupted by the horrible\r\nvision of the "Sergeant\'s slaughter-house," as, in his coarse language,\r\nhe styled it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE WALK.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day after the evening on which the various events we have\r\ndescribed had passed, a bright autumnal sun shone from a pure sky; the\r\ndarkness of the night had wholly disappeared. Although always shaded by\r\nthe height of the houses, the disreputable neighbourhood into which the\r\nreader has followed us seemed less horrible when viewed in the light of\r\nopen day.\r\n\r\nWhether Rodolph no longer feared meeting with the two persons whom he\r\nhad evaded the over-night, or did not care whether he faced them or not,\r\nabout eleven o\'clock in the morning he entered the Rue aux Feves, and\r\ndirected his steps towards the tavern of the ogress.\r\n\r\nRodolph was still in a workman\'s dress; but there was a decided neatness\r\nin his costume. His new blouse, open on his chest, showed a red woollen\r\nshirt, closed by several silver buttons; whilst the collar of another\r\nshirt, of white cotton, fell over a black silk cravat, loosely tied\r\naround his neck. From under his sky blue velvet cap, with a bright\r\nleather peak, several locks of chestnut hair were seen; and his boots,\r\ncleaned very brightly, and replacing the heavy iron shoes of the\r\nprevious evening, showed off to advantage a well-formed foot, which\r\nseemed all the smaller from appearing out of a loose pantaloon of olive\r\nvelveteen. The costume was well calculated to display the elegant shape\r\nand carriage of Rodolph, which combined so much grace, suppleness, and\r\npower. The ogress was airing herself at her door when Rodolph presented\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n"Your servant, young man; you have come, no doubt, for your change of\r\nthe twenty francs," she said, with some show of respect, not venturing\r\nto forget that the conqueror of the Chourineur had handed her a louis\r\nd\'or the previous evening. "There is seventeen francs ten sous coming to\r\nyou; but that\'s not all. There was somebody here asking after you last\r\nnight,--a tall gent, well dressed, and with him a young woman in men\'s\r\nclothes. They drank my best wine along with the Chourineur."\r\n\r\n"Oh, with the Chourineur, did they? And what could they have to say to\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\n"When I say they drank, I make a mistake; they only just sipped a drain\r\nor so, and--"\r\n\r\n"But what did they say to the Chourineur?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, they talked of all manner of things,--of Bras Rouge, and the rain,\r\nand fine weather."\r\n\r\n"Do they know Bras Rouge?"\r\n\r\n"Not by no means; the Chourineur told \'em all about him, and as how as\r\nyou--"\r\n\r\n"Well, well, that is not what I want to know."\r\n\r\n"You want your change."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and I want to take Goualeuse to pass the day in the country."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s impossible!"\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Why? Because she may never come back again. Her things belong to me,\r\nnot including as she owes me a matter of ninety francs as a balance for\r\nher board and lodging, for the six weeks as she has lodged with me; and\r\nif I didn\'t know her to be as honest a gal as is, I should never let her\r\ngo out of sight."\r\n\r\n"Goualeuse owes you ninety francs?"\r\n\r\n"Ninety francs ten sous; but what\'s that to you, my lad? Are you a-going\r\nto come \'my lord,\' and pay it for her?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Rodolph, throwing five louis on the ogress\'s bar, "and\r\nwhat\'s your price for the clothes she wears?"\r\n\r\nThe old hag, amazed, looked at the louis one after the other, with an\r\nair of much doubt and mistrust.\r\n\r\n"What! do you think I have given you bad money? Send and get change for\r\none of them; but make haste about it. I say, again, how much for the\r\ngarments the poor girl is wearing?"\r\n\r\nThe ogress, divided between her desire to make a good harvest, her\r\nsurprise to see a workman with so much money, the fear of being cheated,\r\nand the hopes of still greater gain, was silent for an instant, and then\r\nreplied, "Oh, them things is well worth a hundred francs."\r\n\r\n"What! those rags? Come, now, you shall keep the change from yesterday,\r\nand I\'ll give you another louis, and no more. If I give you all I have,\r\nI shall cheat the poor, who ought to get some alms out of me."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, my fine fellow, I\'ll keep my things, and Goualeuse sha\'n\'t\r\ngo out. I have a right to sell my things for what I choose."\r\n\r\n"May Lucifer one day fry you as you deserve! Here\'s your money; go and\r\nlook for Goualeuse."\r\n\r\nThe ogress pocketed the gold, thinking that the workman had committed a\r\nrobbery, or received a legacy, and then said, with a nasty leer, "Well,\r\nindeed! Why not go up-stairs, and find Goualeuse yourself; she\'ll be\r\nvery glad to see you, for, on my life, she was much smitten with you\r\nyesterday?"\r\n\r\n"Do you go and fetch her, and tell her I will take her into the country;\r\nthat\'s all you need say; not a word about my having paid you her debt."\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s that to you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing; it\'s no matter to me; I would rather that she still\r\nbelieved herself in my clutch--"\r\n\r\n"Will you hold your tongue, and do as I bid you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, what a cross creetur you are! I pity anybody who is under you.\r\nWell, I\'m going, I\'m going;" and the ogress went up-stairs.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes she came down again.\r\n\r\n"Goualeuse would not believe me, and really turned quite crimson when\r\nshe knew you were here; and when I told her that I would give her leave\r\nto pass the day in the country, I thought she would have gone\r\ncrazy,--for the first time in her life she was inclined to throw her\r\narms about my neck."\r\n\r\n"That was her delight at leaving you."\r\n\r\nFleur-de-Marie entered at this moment, dressed as she was the\r\nover-night, with her gown of brown stuff, her little orange shawl tied\r\nbehind her, and her handkerchief of red checks over her head, leaving\r\nonly two thick bands of light hair visible. She blushed when she saw\r\nRodolph, and looked down with a confused air.\r\n\r\n"Would you like to pass the day in the country with me, my lass?" asked\r\nRodolph.\r\n\r\n"Very much, indeed, M. Rodolph," said Goualeuse, "since madame gives me\r\nleave."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, you may go, my little duck, because you\'re such a good gal.\r\nCome and kiss me afore you go."\r\n\r\nAnd the old beldam offered her bloated lips to Fleur-de-Marie. The poor\r\ngirl, overcoming her disgust, bent her forehead to the ogress, but\r\nRodolph, giving a sudden push with his elbow, shoved the hag back on her\r\nseat, took Fleur-de-Marie\'s arm, and left the _tapis-franc_, amidst the\r\nloud maledictions of Mother Ponisse.\r\n\r\n"Mind, M. Rodolph," said Goualeuse; "the ogress will, perhaps, throw\r\nsomething at you,--she is very spiteful."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t heed her, my girl. But what\'s the matter with you? You seem\r\nembarrassed, sad. Are you sorry for having come out with me?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, no; but--but--you give me your arm!"\r\n\r\n"Well, and what of that?"\r\n\r\n"You are a workman, and some one may tell your master that they met you\r\nwith me, and harm may come of it; masters do not like their workmen to\r\nbe unsteady." And Goualeuse gently removed her arm from that of Rodolph,\r\nadding, "Go on by yourself; I will follow you to the barrier; when we\r\nare once in the fields I can walk with you."\r\n\r\n"Do not be uneasy," said Rodolph, touched by the poor girl\'s\r\nconsideration, and taking her arm again; "my master does not live in\r\nthis quarter, and we shall find a coach on the Quai aux Fleurs."\r\n\r\n"As you please, M. Rodolph; I only said so that you might not get into\r\ntrouble."\r\n\r\n"I am sure of that, and thank you very much. But tell me, is it all the\r\nsame to you what part of the country we go into?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, quite so, M. Rodolph, so that it be the country. It is so fine and\r\nit is so nice to breathe the open air! Do you know that I have not been\r\nfarther than the flower-market for these six weeks? And now, if the\r\nogress allows me to leave the Cite, she must have great confidence in\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"And when you came here, was it to buy flowers?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, I had no money; I only came to look at them, and breathe their\r\nbeautiful smell. During the half-hour which the ogress allowed me to\r\npass on the quay on market-days, I was so happy that I forgot everything\r\nelse."\r\n\r\n"And on returning to the ogress, and those filthy streets?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, why, then I returned more sad than when I set out; but I wiped my\r\neyes, that I might not be beaten for crying. Yet, at the market, what\r\nmade me envious--oh, so envious!--was to see neat, clean little\r\nworkwomen, who were going away so gaily with a beautiful pot of flowers\r\nin their hands."\r\n\r\n"I am sure that if you had had but a few flowers in your own window,\r\nthey would have kept you company."\r\n\r\n"What you say is quite true, M. Rodolph. Only imagine, one day, on her\r\nbirthday, the ogress, knowing my taste, gave me a little rose-tree. If\r\nyou only knew how happy it made me,--I was never tired of looking at\r\nit,--my own rose-tree! I counted its leaves, its flowers; but the air of\r\nthe Cite is bad, and it began to wither in two days. Then--but you\'ll\r\nlaugh at me, M. Rodolph."\r\n\r\n"No, no; go on."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I asked the ogress to let me go out, and take my rose-tree\r\nfor a walk, as I would have taken a child out. Well, then, I carried it\r\nto the quay, thinking that to be with other flowers in the fresh and\r\nbalmy air would do it good. I bathed its poor fading leaves in the clear\r\nwaters of the fountain, and then to dry it I placed it for a full\r\nquarter of an hour in the sun. Dear little rose-tree! it never saw the\r\nsun in the Cite any more than I did, for in our street it never descends\r\nlower than the roof. At last I went back again, and I assure you, M.\r\nRodolph, that, thanks to these walks, my rose-tree lived at least ten\r\ndays longer than it would have done, had I not taken such pains with\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"No doubt of it. But when it died, what a loss it must have been to\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\n"I cried heartily, for it grieved me very, very much; and you see, M.\r\nRodolph,--for you know one loves flowers, although one hasn\'t any of\r\none\'s own,--you see, I felt grateful to it, that dear rose-tree, for\r\nblooming so kindly for me, although I was so--"\r\n\r\nGoualeuse bent her head, and blushed deeply.\r\n\r\n"Unhappy child! With this feeling of your own position, you must\r\noften--"\r\n\r\n"Have desired to end it, you mean, sir?" said Goualeuse, interrupting\r\nher companion. "Yes, yes, more than once. A month ago I looked over the\r\nparapet at the Seine; but then, when I looked at the flowers, and the\r\nsun, then I said, \'The river will be always there; I am but sixteen and\r\na half,--who knows?\'"\r\n\r\n"When you said \'who knows,\' you had hope?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And what did you hope?"\r\n\r\n"To find some charitable soul who would get me work, so that I might be\r\nenabled to leave the ogress; and this hope comforted me. Then I said to\r\nmyself, I am very wretched, but I have never injured anybody, and if I\r\nhad any one to advise me I should not be as I am. This lightened my\r\nsorrow a little, though it had greatly increased at the loss of my\r\nrose-tree," added Goualeuse, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n"Always so very sad."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but look, here it is."\r\n\r\nAnd Goualeuse took from her pocket a little bundle of wood trimmed very\r\ncarefully, and tied with a rose-coloured bow.\r\n\r\n"What, have you kept it?"\r\n\r\n"I have, indeed; it is all I possess in the world."\r\n\r\n"What, have you nothing else?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing."\r\n\r\n"This coral necklace?"\r\n\r\n"Belongs to the ogress."\r\n\r\n"And you have not a piece of riband, a cap, or handkerchief?"\r\n\r\n"No, nothing,--nothing but the dead branches of my poor rose-tree; and\r\nthat is why I love it so."\r\n\r\nWhen Rodolph and Goualeuse had reached the Quai aux Fleurs, a coach was\r\nwaiting there, into which Rodolph handed Goualeuse. He got in himself,\r\nsaying to the driver:\r\n\r\n"To St. Denis; I will tell you presently which road to take."\r\n\r\nThe coach went on. The sun was bright, and the sky cloudless, whilst the\r\nair, fresh and crisp, circulated freely through the open windows.\r\n\r\n"Here is a woman\'s cloak!" said Goualeuse, remarking that she had seated\r\nherself on the garment without having at first noticed it.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is for you, my child; I brought it with me for fear you should\r\nbe cold."\r\n\r\nLittle accustomed to such attention, the poor girl looked at Rodolph\r\nwith surprise.\r\n\r\n"_Mon Dieu!_ M. Rodolph, how kind you are; I am really ashamed--"\r\n\r\n"Because I am kind?"\r\n\r\n"No; but you do not speak as you did yesterday; you appear quite another\r\nperson."\r\n\r\n"Tell me, then, Fleur-de-Marie, which do you like best,--the Rodolph of\r\nyesterday, or the Rodolph of to-day?"\r\n\r\n"I like you better now; yet yesterday I seemed to be more your equal."\r\nThen, as if correcting herself, and fearing to have annoyed Rodolph, she\r\nsaid to him, "When I say your equal, M. Rodolph, I do not mean that I\r\ncan ever be that."\r\n\r\n"One thing in you astonishes me very much, Fleur-de-Marie."\r\n\r\n"And what is that, M. Rodolph?"\r\n\r\n"You appear to have forgotten that the Chouette said to you yesterday\r\nthat she knew the persons who had brought you up."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I have not forgotten it; I thought of it all night, and I cried\r\nbitterly; but I am sure it is not true; she invented this tale to make\r\nme unhappy."\r\n\r\n"Yet the Chouette may know more than you think. If it were so, should\r\nyou not be delighted to be restored to your parents?"\r\n\r\n"Alas, sir! if my parents never loved me, what should I gain by\r\ndiscovering them? They would only see me and--But if they _did_ ever\r\nlove me, what shame I should bring on them! Perhaps I should kill them!"\r\n\r\n"If your parents ever loved you, Fleur-de-Marie, they will pity,\r\npardon, and still love you. If they have abandoned you, then, when they\r\nsee the frightful destiny to which they have brought you, _their_ shame\r\nand remorse will avenge you."\r\n\r\n"What is the good of vengeance?"\r\n\r\n"You are right; let us talk no more on the subject."\r\n\r\nAt this moment the carriage reached St. Ouen, where the road divides to\r\nSt. Denis and the Revolte. In spite of the monotony of the landscape,\r\nFleur-de-Marie was so delighted at seeing the fields, as she called\r\nthem, that, forgetting the sad thoughts which the recollection of the\r\nChouette had awakened in her, her lovely countenance grew radiant with\r\ndelight. She leaned out of the window, clasping her hands, and crying:\r\n\r\n"M. Rodolph, how happy I am! Grass! Fields! May I get out? It is so\r\nfine! I should so like to run in the meadows."\r\n\r\n"Let us run, then, my child. Coachman, stop."\r\n\r\n"What! You, too? Will you run, M. Rodolph?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m having a holiday."\r\n\r\n"Oh! What pleasure!"\r\n\r\nAnd Rodolph and Goualeuse, taking each other\'s hand, ran as fast as they\r\ncould over a long piece of latter-grass, just mowed. It would be\r\nimpossible to describe the leaps and exclamations of joy, the intense\r\ndelight, of Fleur-de-Marie. Poor lamb! so long a prisoner, she inspired\r\nthe free air with indescribable pleasure. She ran, returned, stopped,\r\nand then raced off again with renewed happiness. At the sight of the\r\ndaisies and buttercups Goualeuse could not restrain her transport,--she\r\ndid not leave one flower which she could gather. After having run about\r\nin this way for some time, she became rather tired, for she had lost the\r\nhabit of exercise, and stopped to take breath, sitting down on the trunk\r\nof a fallen tree which was lying at the edge of a deep ditch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "_She Proffered to Rodolph the Bouquet_"\r\nEtching by Mercier, after the drawing by Frank T. Merrill]\r\n\r\nThe clear and white complexion of Fleur-de-Marie, generally rather pale,\r\nwas now heightened by the brightest colour. Her large blue eyes sparkled\r\nbrightly, her vermilion lips, partly opened to recover her breath,\r\ndisplayed two rows of liquid pearls; her bosom throbbed under her\r\nworn-out little orange shawl, and she placed one of her hands upon her\r\nheart, as if to restrain its quickened pulsation, whilst with the other\r\nhand she proffered to Rodolph the bouquet of field flowers which she had\r\njust gathered. Nothing could be more charming than the combination of\r\ninnocence and pure joy which beamed on her expressive countenance. When\r\nFleur-de-Marie could speak, she said to Rodolph, with an accent of\r\nsupreme happiness and of gratitude, almost amounting to piety:\r\n\r\n"How good is the great God to give us so fine a day!"\r\n\r\nA tear came into Rodolph\'s eye when he heard this poor, forsaken,\r\ndespised, lost creature utter a cry of happiness and deep gratitude to\r\nthe Creator, because she enjoyed a ray of sunshine and the sight of a\r\ngreen field. He was roused from his reverie by an unexpected\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE SURPRISE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have said that Goualeuse was sitting on the trunk of a fallen tree,\r\nat the edge of a deep ditch. Suddenly a man, springing up from the\r\nbottom of this hollow, shook the rubbish from him under which he had\r\nconcealed himself, and burst into a loud fit of laughter. Goualeuse\r\nturned around, screaming with alarm. It was the Chourineur.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be frightened, my girl," said the Chourineur, when he saw her\r\nextreme fear, and that she had sought protection from her companion.\r\n"Ah, Master Rodolph, here\'s a curious meeting, which I am sure neither\r\nyou nor I expected." Then he added, in a serious tone, "Listen, master.\r\nPeople may say what they like, but there is something in the\r\nair,--there, up there, above our heads, very wonderful; which seems to\r\nsay to a man, \'Go where I send you.\' See how you two have been sent\r\nhere. It is devilish wonderful!"\r\n\r\n"What are you doing there?" said Rodolph, greatly surprised.\r\n\r\n"I was on the lookout in a matter of yours, master; but, thunder and\r\nlightning! what a high joke that you should come at this particular\r\nmoment into this very neighbourhood of my country-house! There\'s\r\nsomething in all this,--decidedly there is something."\r\n\r\n"But again I ask you, what are you doing there?"\r\n\r\n"All in good time, I\'ll tell you; only let me first look about me for a\r\nmoment."\r\n\r\nThe Chourineur then ran towards the coach, which was some distance off,\r\nlooked this way and that way over the plain with a keen and rapid\r\nglance, and then rejoined Rodolph, running quickly.\r\n\r\n"Will you explain to me the meaning of all this?"\r\n\r\n"Patience, patience, good master; one word more. What\'s o\'clock?"\r\n\r\n"Half past twelve," said Rodolph, looking at his watch.\r\n\r\n"All right; we have time, then. The Chouette will not be here for the\r\nnext half-hour."\r\n\r\n"The Chouette!" cried Rodolph and the girl both at once.\r\n\r\n"Yes, the Chouette; in two words, master, I\'ll tell you all. Yesterday,\r\nafter you had left the _tapis-franc_, there came--"\r\n\r\n"A tall man with a woman in man\'s attire, who asked for me; I know all\r\nabout that, but then--"\r\n\r\n"Then they paid for my liquor, and wanted to \'draw\' me about you. I had\r\nnothing to tell them, because you had communicated nothing to me, except\r\nthose fisticuffs which settled me. All I know is, that I learned\r\nsomething then which I shall not easily forget. But we are friends for\r\nlife and death, Master Rodolph, though the devil burn me if I know why.\r\nI feel for you the regard which the bulldog feels for his master. It was\r\nafter you told me that I had \'heart and honour;\' but that\'s nothing, so\r\nthere\'s an end of it. It is no use trying to account for it; so it is,\r\nand so let it be, if it\'s any good to you."\r\n\r\n"Many thanks, my man; but go on."\r\n\r\n"The tall man and the little lady in men\'s clothes, finding that they\r\ncould get nothing out of me, left the ogress\'s, and so did I; they going\r\ntowards the Palais de Justice, and I to Notre Dame. On reaching the end\r\nof the street I found it was raining pitchforks, points downward,--a\r\ncomplete deluge. There was an old house in ruins close at hand, and I\r\nsaid to myself, \'If this shower is to last all night, I shall sleep as\r\nwell here as in my own "crib."\' So I rolled myself into a sort of cave,\r\nwhere I was high and dry; my bed was an old beam, and my pillow a heap\r\nof lath and plaster, and there I slept like a king."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, go on."\r\n\r\n"We had drank together, Master Rodolph; I had drank, too, with the tall\r\nman and the little woman dressed in man\'s clothes, so you may believe my\r\nhead was rather heavy, and, besides, nothing sends me off to sleep like\r\na good fall of rain. I began then to snooze, but I had not been long\r\nasleep, I think, when, aroused by a noise, I sat up and listened. I\r\nheard the Schoolmaster, who was talking in a friendly tone with\r\nsomebody. I soon made out that he was parleying with the tall man who\r\ncame into the _tapis-franc_ with the little woman dressed in man\'s\r\nclothes."\r\n\r\n"They in conference with the Schoolmaster and the Chouette?" said\r\nRodolph, with amazement.\r\n\r\n"With the Schoolmaster and the Chouette; and they agreed to meet again\r\non the morrow."\r\n\r\n"That\'s to-day!" said Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"At one o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"This very moment!"\r\n\r\n"Where the road branches off to St. Denis and La Revolte."\r\n\r\n"This very spot!"\r\n\r\n"Just as you say, Master Rodolph, on this very spot."\r\n\r\n"The Schoolmaster! Oh, pray be on your guard, M. Rodolph," exclaimed\r\nFleur-de-Marie.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be alarmed, my child, he won\'t come; it\'s only the Chouette."\r\n\r\n"How could the man who, with the female in disguise, sought me at the\r\n_tapis-franc_, come into contact with these two wretches?" said Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"I\'faith I don\'t know, and I think I only awoke at the end of the\r\naffair, for the tall man was talking of getting back his pocketbook,\r\nwhich the Chouette was to bring here in exchange for five hundred\r\nfrancs. I should say that the Schoolmaster had begun by robbing him, and\r\nthat it was after that that they began to parley, and to come to\r\nfriendly terms."\r\n\r\n"It is very strange."\r\n\r\n"_Mon Dieu!_ it makes me quite frightened on your account, M. Rodolph,"\r\nsaid Fleur-de-Marie.\r\n\r\n"Master Rodolph is no chicken, girl; but as you say, there may be\r\nsomething working against him, and so I am here."\r\n\r\n"Go on, my good fellow."\r\n\r\n"The tall man and the little woman have promised two thousand francs to\r\nthe Schoolmaster to do to you--I don\'t know what. The Chouette is to be\r\nhere directly to return the pocketbook, and to know what is required\r\nfrom them, which she is to tell the Schoolmaster, who will undertake\r\nit."\r\n\r\nFleur-de-Marie started. Rodolph smiled disdainfully.\r\n\r\n"Two thousand francs to do something to you, Master Rodolph; that makes\r\nme think that when I see a notice of a dog that has been lost (I don\'t\r\nmean to make a comparison), and the offer of a hundred francs reward for\r\nhis discovery, I say to myself, \'Animal, if you were lost, no one would\r\ngive a hundred farthings to find you.\' Two thousand francs to do\r\nsomething to you! Who are you, then?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you by and by."\r\n\r\n"That\'s enough, master. When I heard this proposal, I said to myself, I\r\nmust find out where these two dons live who want to set the Schoolmaster\r\non the haunches of M. Rodolph; it may be serviceable. So when they had\r\ngone away, I got out of my hiding-place, and followed them quietly. I\r\nsaw the tall man and little woman get into a coach near Notre Dame, and\r\nI got up behind, and we went on until we reached the Boulevard de\r\nl\'Observatoire. It was as dark as the mouth of an oven, and I could not\r\ndistinguish anything, so I cut a notch in a tree, that I might find out\r\nthe place in the morning."\r\n\r\n"Well thought of, my good fellow."\r\n\r\n"This morning I went there, and about ten yards from the tree I saw a\r\nnarrow entrance, closed by a gate. In the mud there were little and\r\nlarge footsteps, and at the end of the entrance a small garden-gate,\r\nwhere the traces ended; so the roosting-place of the tall man and the\r\nlittle woman must be there."\r\n\r\n"Thanks, my worthy friend, you have done me a most essential piece of\r\nservice, without knowing it."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, Master Rodolph, but I believed I was serving you,\r\nand that was the reason I did as I did."\r\n\r\n"I know it, my fine fellow, and I wish I could recompense your service\r\nmore properly than by thanks; but, unfortunately, I am only a poor devil\r\nof a workman, although you say they offer two thousand francs for\r\nsomething to be done against me. I will explain that to you."\r\n\r\n"Yes, if you like, but not unless. Somebody threatens you with\r\nsomething, and I will come across them if I can; the rest is your\r\naffair."\r\n\r\n"I know what they want. Listen to me. I have a secret for cutting fans\r\nin ivory by a mechanical process, but this secret does not belong to me\r\nalone. I am awaiting my comrade to go to work, and, no doubt, it is the\r\nmodel of the machine which I have at home that they are desirous of\r\ngetting from me at any price, for there is a great deal of money to be\r\nmade by this discovery."\r\n\r\n"The tall man and the little woman then are--"\r\n\r\n"Work-people with whom I have been associated, and to whom I have\r\nrefused my secret."\r\n\r\nThis explanation appeared satisfactory to the Chourineur, whose\r\napprehension was not the clearest in the world, and he replied:\r\n\r\n"Now I understand it all. The beggars! you see they have not the courage\r\nto do their dirty tricks themselves. But to come to the end of my story.\r\nI said to myself this morning, I know the rendezvous of the Chouette and\r\nthe tall man; I will go there and wait for them; I have good legs, and\r\nmy employer will wait for me. I came here and found this hole, and,\r\ntaking an armful of stuff from the dunghill yonder, I hid myself here up\r\nto my nose, and waited for the Chouette. But, lo and behold! you came\r\ninto the field, and poor Goualeuse came and sat down on the very edge of\r\nmy park, and then I determined to have a bit of fun, and, jumping out of\r\nmy lair, I called out like a man on fire."\r\n\r\n"And now what do you propose to do?"\r\n\r\n"To wait for the Chouette, who is sure to come first; to try and\r\noverhear what she and the tall man talk about, for that may be useful\r\nfor you to know. There is nothing in the field but this trunk of a tree,\r\nand from here you may see all over the plain; it is as if it were made\r\non purpose to sit down upon. The rendezvous of the Chouette is only four\r\nsteps off at the cross-road, and I will lay a bet they come and sit here\r\nwhen they arrive. If I cannot hear anything, then, as soon as they\r\nseparate, I will follow the Chouette, who is sure to stay last, and I\'ll\r\npay her the old grudge I owe her for the Goualeuse\'s tooth; and I\'ll\r\ntwist her neck until she tells me the name of the parents of the poor\r\ngirl, for she says she knows them. What do you think of my idea, Master\r\nRodolph?"\r\n\r\n"I like it very well, my lad; but there is one part which you must\r\nalter."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Chourineur, do not get yourself into any quarrel on my account. If\r\nyou beat the Chouette, then the Schoolmaster--"\r\n\r\n"Say no more, my lass. The Chouette shall not go scot free for me.\r\nConfound it! why, for the very reason that the Schoolmaster will defend\r\nher, I will double her dose."\r\n\r\n"Listen, my man, to me; I have a better plan for avenging the Chouette\'s\r\nbrutalities to Goualeuse, which I will tell you hereafter. Now," said\r\nRodolph, moving a few paces from Goualeuse, and speaking low, "Now, will\r\nyou render me a real service?"\r\n\r\n"Name it, Master Rodolph."\r\n\r\n"The Chouette does not know you?"\r\n\r\n"I saw her yesterday for the first time at the _tapis-franc_."\r\n\r\n"This is what you must do. Hide yourself first; but, when you see her\r\ncome close to you, get out of this hole--"\r\n\r\n"And twist her neck?"\r\n\r\n"No, defer that for a time. To-day, only prevent her from speaking to\r\nthe tall man. He, seeing some one with her, will not approach; and if he\r\ndoes, do not leave her alone for a moment. He cannot make his proposal\r\nbefore you."\r\n\r\n"If the man thinks me curious, I know what to do; he is neither the\r\nSchoolmaster nor Master Rodolph. I will follow the Chouette like her\r\nshadow, and the man shall not say a word that I do not overhear. He will\r\nthen be off, and after that I will have one little turn with the\r\nChouette. I must have it; it will be such a sweet drop for me."\r\n\r\n"Not yet; the one-eyed hag does not know whether you are a thief or\r\nnot?"\r\n\r\n"No, not unless the Schoolmaster has talked of me to her, and told her\r\nthat I did not do business in that line."\r\n\r\n"If he have, you must appear to have altered your ideas on that\r\nsubject."\r\n\r\n"I?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Ten thousand thunders! M. Rodolph, what do you mean? Indeed--truly--I\r\ndon\'t like it; it does not suit me to play such a farce as that."\r\n\r\n"You shall only do what you please; but you will not find that I shall\r\nsuggest any infamous plan to you. The tall man once driven away, you\r\nmust try and talk over the Chouette. As she will be very savage at\r\nhaving missed the good haul she expected, you must try and smooth her\r\ndown by telling her that you know of a capital bit of business which may\r\nbe done, and that you are then waiting for your comrade, and that, if\r\nthe Schoolmaster will join you, there is a lump of money to be made."\r\n\r\n"Well, well."\r\n\r\n"After waiting with her for an hour, you may say, \'My mate does not\r\ncome, and so the job must be put off;\' and then you may make an\r\nappointment with the Chouette and the Schoolmaster for to-morrow, at an\r\nearly hour. Do you understand me?"\r\n\r\n"Quite."\r\n\r\n"And this evening, at ten o\'clock, meet me at the corner of the Champs\r\nElysees and the Allee des Veuves, and I will tell you more."\r\n\r\n"If it is a trap, look out! The Schoolmaster is a scoundrel. You have\r\nbeaten him, and, no doubt, he will kill you if he can."\r\n\r\n"Have no fear."\r\n\r\n"By Jove! it is a \'rum start;\' but do as you like with me. I do not\r\nhesitate, for something tells me that there is a rod in pickle for the\r\nSchoolmaster and the Chouette. One word, though, if you please, M.\r\nRodolph."\r\n\r\n"Say it."\r\n\r\n"I do not think you are the man to lay a trap, and set the police on the\r\nSchoolmaster. He is an arrant blackguard, who deserves a hundred deaths;\r\nbut to have them arrested, that I will not have a hand in."\r\n\r\n"Nor I, my boy; but I have a score to wipe off with him and the\r\nChouette, because they are in a plot with others against me; but we two\r\nwill baffle them completely, if you will lend me your assistance."\r\n\r\n"Of course I will; and, if that is to be the game, I am your man. But\r\nquick, quick," cried the Chourineur, "down there I see the head of the\r\nChouette. I know it is her bonnet. Go, go, and I will drop into my\r\nhole."\r\n\r\n"To-night, then, at ten o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"At the corner of the Champs Elysees and the Allee des Veuves; all\r\nright."\r\n\r\nFleur-de-Marie had not heard a word of the latter part of the\r\nconversation between the Chourineur and Rodolph, and now entered again\r\ninto the coach with her travelling companion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nCASTLES IN THE AIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some time after this conversation with the Chourineur, Rodolph\r\nremained preoccupied and pensive, while Fleur-de-Marie, too timid to\r\nbreak the silence, continued to gaze on him with saddened earnestness.\r\nAt length Rodolph looked up, and, meeting her mournful look, smiled\r\nkindly on her, and said, "What are you thinking of, my child? I fear our\r\nrencontre with the Chourineur has made you uncomfortable, and we were so\r\nmerry, too."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, M. Rodolph, indeed, I do not mind it at all; nay, I even\r\nbelieve the meeting with the Chourineur may be useful to you."\r\n\r\n"Did not this man pass amongst the inhabitants of the _tapis-franc_ as\r\npossessing some good points among his many bad ones?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I know not, M. Rodolph; for although, previously to the scene\r\nof yesterday, I had frequently seen him, I had scarcely ever spoken to\r\nhim. I always looked upon him as bad as all the rest."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, do not let us talk any more about him, my pretty\r\nFleur-de-Marie. I should be sorry, indeed, to make you sad,--I, who\r\nbrought you out purposely that you might spend a happy day."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am happy. It is so very long since I have been out of Paris."\r\n\r\n"Not since your grand doings with Rigolette."\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed, M. Rodolph; but that was in the spring. Yet, though it is\r\nnow autumn, I enjoy it quite as much. How beautifully the sun shines!\r\nOnly look at the gold-coloured clouds out there--there, I mean; and then\r\nthat hill, with its pretty white houses half hid among the trees, and\r\nthe leaves still so green, though we are in the middle of the month of\r\nOctober. Do not you think it is wonderful, M. Rodolph, they should so\r\nwell preserve their verdure? In Paris, all the leaves wither so soon.\r\nLook! look at those pigeons! how many there are! and how high they fly!\r\nNow they are settling on that old mill. One is never tired in the open\r\nfields of looking at all these amusing sights."\r\n\r\n"It, is, indeed, a pleasure to behold the delight you seem to take in\r\nall these trifling matters, Fleur-de-Marie; though they, in reality,\r\nconstitute the charm of a landscape."\r\n\r\nAnd Rodolph was right; for the countenance of his companion, while\r\ngazing upon the fair, calm scene before her, was lit up with an\r\nexpression of the purest joy.\r\n\r\n"See!" she exclaimed, after intently watching the different objects that\r\nunfolded themselves to her eager look, "see how beautifully the clear\r\nwhite smoke rises from those cottages, and ascends to the very clouds\r\nthemselves; and there are some men ploughing the land. What a capital\r\nplough they have got, drawn by those two fine gray horses. Oh, if I were\r\na man, how I should like to be a husbandman, to go out in the fields,\r\nand drive one\'s own plough; and then when you look to see the blue\r\nskies, and the green shiny leaves of the neighbouring forests,--such a\r\nday as to-day, for instance, when you feel half inclined to weep,\r\nwithout knowing why, and begin singing old and melancholy songs, like\r\n\'Genevieve de Brabant.\' Do you know \'Genevieve de Brabant,\' M. Rodolph?"\r\n\r\n"No, my child; but I hope you will have the kindness to sing it to me\r\nbefore the day is over. You know our time is all our own."\r\n\r\nAt these words, which reminded the poor Goualeuse that her newly tasted\r\nhappiness was fast fleeting away, and that, at the close of this, the\r\nbrightest day that had ever shone on her existence, she must return to\r\nall the horrors of a corrupt city, her feelings broke through all\r\nrestraint, she hid her face in her hands and burst into tears. Much\r\nsurprised at her emotion, Rodolph kindly inquired its cause.\r\n\r\n"What ails you, Fleur-de-Marie? What fresh grief have you found?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing,--nothing indeed, M. Rodolph," replied the girl, drying her\r\neyes and trying to smile. "Pray forgive me for being so sad, and please\r\nnot to notice it. I assure you I have nothing at all to grieve\r\nabout,--it is only a fancy; and now I am going to be quite gay, you will\r\nsee."\r\n\r\n"And you were as gay as could be a few minutes ago."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know I was; and it was my thinking how soon--" answered\r\nFleur-de-Marie, naively, and raising her large, tearful blue eyes, with\r\ntouching candour, to his face.\r\n\r\nThe look, the words, fully enlightened Rodolph as to the cause of her\r\ndistress, and, wishing to dissipate it, he said, smilingly:\r\n\r\n"I would lay a wager you are regretting your poor rose-tree, and are\r\ncrying because you could not bring it out walking with you, as you used\r\nto do."\r\n\r\nLa Goualeuse fell into the good-natured scheme for regaining her\r\ncheerfulness, and by degrees the clouds of sadness cleared away from her\r\nfair young face; and once again she appeared absorbed in the pleasure of\r\nthe moment, without allowing herself to recollect the future that would\r\nsucceed it. The vehicle had by this time almost arrived at St. Denis,\r\nand the tall spires of the cathedral were visible.\r\n\r\n"Oh, what a fine steeple!" exclaimed La Goualeuse.\r\n\r\n"It is that of the splendid church of St. Denis: would you like to see\r\nit? We can easily stop our carriage."\r\n\r\nPoor Fleur-de-Marie cast down her eyes. "From the hour I went to live\r\nwith the ogress," said she, in a low tone, while deep blushes dyed her\r\ncheek, "I never once entered a church,--I durst not. When in prison, on\r\nthe contrary, I used to delight in helping to sing the mass; and,\r\nagainst the Fete-Dieu, oh, I made such lovely bouquets for the altar!"\r\n\r\n"But God is merciful and good; why, then, fear to pray to him, or to\r\nenter his holy church?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, no, M. Rodolph! I have offended God deeply enough; let me not\r\nadd impiety and sacrilege to my sins."\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\'s silence, Rodolph again renewed the conversation, and,\r\nkindly taking the hand of La Goualeuse, said, "Fleur-de-Marie, tell me\r\nhonestly, have you ever known what it is to love?"\r\n\r\n"Never, M. Rodolph."\r\n\r\n"And how do you account for this?"\r\n\r\n"You saw the kind of persons who frequented the _tapis-franc_. And then,\r\nto love, the object should be good and virtuous--"\r\n\r\n"Why do you think so?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, because one\'s lover, or husband, would be all in all to us, and we\r\nshould seek no greater happiness than devoting our life to him. But, M.\r\nRodolph, if you please, we will talk of something else, for the tears\r\nwill come into my eyes."\r\n\r\n"Willingly, Fleur-de-Marie; let us change the conversation. And now tell\r\nme, why do you look so beseechingly at me with those large, tearful\r\neyes? Have I done anything to displease you?"\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, \'tis the excess of your goodness that makes me weep;\r\nindeed, I could almost fancy that you had brought me out solely for my\r\nindividual pleasure and enjoyment, without thinking of yourself. Not\r\ncontent with your generous defence of me yesterday, you have to-day\r\nprocured for me happiness such as I never hoped to enjoy."\r\n\r\n"You are, then, truly and entirely happy?"\r\n\r\n"Never, never shall I forget to-day."\r\n\r\n"Happiness does not often attend us on earth," said Rodolph, sighing.\r\n\r\n"Alas, no! Seldom, perhaps never."\r\n\r\n"For my own part, to make up for a want of reality in its possession, I\r\noften amuse myself with pictures of what I would have if I could, saying\r\nto myself, this is how, and where, I should like to live,--this is the\r\nsort of income I should like to enjoy. Have you never, my little\r\nFleur-de-Marie, amused yourself with building similar \'castles in the\r\nair?\'"\r\n\r\n"Yes, formerly, when I was in prison, before I went to live with the\r\nogress,--then I used to do nothing all day but dance, sing, and build\r\nthese fairy dreams; but I very seldom do so now. Tell me, M. Rodolph, if\r\nyou could have any wish you liked, what should you most desire?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I should like to be rich, with plenty of servants and carriages; to\r\npossess a splendid hotel, and to mix in the first circles of fashion; to\r\nbe able to obtain any amusement I pleased, and to go to the theatres and\r\nopera whenever I chose."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, you would be more unreasonable than I should. Now I will\r\ntell you exactly what would satisfy me in every respect: first of all,\r\nsufficient money to clear myself with the ogress, and to keep me till I\r\ncould obtain work for my future support; then a pretty, little, nice,\r\nclean room, all to myself, from the window of which I could see the\r\ntrees while I sat at my work."\r\n\r\n"Plenty of flowers in your casement, of course?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, certainly! And, if it could be managed, to live in the country\r\nalways. And that, I think, is all I should want."\r\n\r\n"Let me see: a little room, and work enough to maintain you,--those are\r\npositive necessaries; but, when one is merely wishing, there is no harm\r\nin adding a few superfluities. Should you not like such nice things as\r\ncarriages, diamonds, and rich clothes?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all! All I wish for is my free and undisturbed liberty,--a\r\ncountry life, and the certainty of not dying in a hospital. Oh, that\r\nidea is dreadful! Above all things, I would desire the certainty of its\r\nnever being my fate. Oh, M. Rodolph, that dread often comes across me\r\nand fills me with terror."\r\n\r\n"Alas! poor folks, such as we are, should not shrink from such things."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis not the dying in a charitable institution I dread, or the poverty\r\nthat would send me into it, but the thoughts of what they do to your\r\nlifeless remains."\r\n\r\n"What do they do that shocks you so much?"\r\n\r\n"Is it possible, M. Rodolph, you have never been told what will become\r\nof you if you die in one of those places?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, I have not; do you tell me."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I knew a young girl, who had been a sort of companion to me\r\nwhen I was in prison; she afterwards died in a hospital, and what do you\r\nthink? Her body was given to the surgeons for dissection!" murmured the\r\nshuddering Fleur-de-Marie.\r\n\r\n"That is, indeed, a frightful idea! And do these miserable anticipations\r\noften trouble you, my poor girl?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, M. Rodolph, it surprises you that, after my unhappy life, I can\r\nfeel any concern as to what becomes of my miserable remains! God knows,\r\nthe feeling which makes me shrink from such an outrage to modesty is all\r\nmy wretched fate has left me!"\r\n\r\nThe mournful tone in which these words were uttered, and the bitter\r\nfeelings they contained, went to the heart of Rodolph; but his\r\ncompanion, quickly perceiving his air of dejection, and blaming herself\r\nfor having caused it, said, timidly:\r\n\r\n"M. Rodolph, I feel that I am behaving very ill and ungratefully towards\r\nyou, who so kindly brought me out to amuse me and give me pleasure; in\r\nreturn for which I only keep talking to you about all the dull and\r\ngloomy things I can think of! I wonder how I can do so!--to be able even\r\nto recollect my misery, when all around me smiles and looks so gay! I\r\ncannot tell how it is, words seem to rise from my lips in spite of\r\nmyself; and, though I feel happier to-day than I ever did before in my\r\nlife, my eyes are continually filling with tears! You are not angry with\r\nme, are you, M. Rodolph? See, too, my sadness is going away as suddenly\r\nas it came. There now, it is all gone, and shall not return to vex you\r\nany more, I am determined. Look, M. Rodolph, just look at my eyes,--they\r\ndo not show that I have been crying, do they?"\r\n\r\nAnd here Fleur-de-Marie, having repeatedly closed her eyes to get rid of\r\nthe rebellious tears that would gather there, opened them full upon\r\nRodolph, with a look of most enchanting candour and sweetness.\r\n\r\n"Put no restraint on yourself, I beseech you, Fleur-de-Marie: be gay, if\r\nyou really feel so; or sad, if sadness most suits your present state of\r\nmind. I have my own hours of gloom and melancholy, and my sufferings\r\nwould be much increased were I compelled to feign a lightness of heart I\r\ndid not really possess."\r\n\r\n"Can it be possible, M. Rodolph, that you are ever sad?"\r\n\r\n"Quite possible, my child, and true. Alas! the prospect before me is but\r\nlittle brighter than your own. I, like you, am without friends or\r\nparents; what would become of me if I were to fall ill and be unable to\r\nearn my daily bread,--for I need scarcely tell you I live but from day\r\nto day, and spend my money quite as fast as I obtain it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, but that is wrong, M. Rodolph,--very, very wrong!" said La\r\nGoualeuse, in a tone of such deep and grave remonstrance as made him\r\nsmile. "You should always lay by something. Look at me: why, all my\r\ntroubles and misfortunes have happened because I did not save my money\r\nmore carefully. If once a person can get a hundred francs beforehand, he\r\nneed never fear falling into any one\'s power; generally, a difficulty\r\nabout money puts very evil thoughts into our head."\r\n\r\n"All that is very wise and very sensible, my frugal little friend; but a\r\nhundred francs!--that is a large sum; how could a man like myself ever\r\namass so much?"\r\n\r\n"Why, M. Rodolph, it is really very easy, if you will but consider a\r\nlittle. First of all, I think you said you could earn five francs a\r\nday?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, so I can, when I choose to work."\r\n\r\n"Ah! but you should work, constantly and regularly; and yours is such a\r\npretty trade. To paint fans! how nice such work must be,--mere\r\namusement, quite a recreation! I cannot think why you should ever be\r\ntired or dull. Indeed, M. Rodolph, I must tell you plainly I do not pity\r\nyou at all; and, besides, really you talk like a mere child when you say\r\nyou cannot save money out of such large earnings," added La Goualeuse,\r\nin a sweet, but, for her, severe tone. "Why, a workman may live well\r\nupon three francs a day; there remain forty sous; at the end of a month,\r\nif you manage prudently, you will have saved sixty francs. Think of\r\nthat! There\'s a sum!--sixty francs in one month!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, but one likes to show off sometimes, and to indulge in a little\r\nidleness."\r\n\r\n"There now, M. Rodolph, I declare you make me quite angry to hear you\r\ntalk so childishly! Pray let me advise you to be wiser."\r\n\r\n"Come, then, my sage little monitress, I will be a good boy, and listen\r\nto all your careful advice. And your idea of saving, too, is a\r\nremarkably good one; I never thought of it before."\r\n\r\n"Really!" exclaimed the poor girl, clapping her hands with joy. "Oh, if\r\nyou knew how delighted I am to hear you say so! Then you will begin from\r\nto-day to lay by the forty sous we were talking about, will you? Will\r\nyou, indeed?"\r\n\r\n"I give you my honour that, from this very hour, I will resolve to\r\nfollow up your most excellent plan, and save forty sous out of each\r\nday\'s pay."\r\n\r\n"Are you quite, quite sure you will?"\r\n\r\n"Nay, have I not promised you that I will?"\r\n\r\n"You will see how proud and happy you will be with your first savings;\r\nand that is not all--ah, if you would promise not to be angry!"\r\n\r\n"Do I look as though I could be so unkind, Fleur-de-Marie, as to find\r\nfault with anything you said?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, indeed, that you do not; only I hardly know whether I ought--"\r\n\r\n"You ought to tell me everything you think or feel, Fleur-de-Marie."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I was wondering how _you_, who, it is easily seen, are\r\nabove your condition, can frequent such low cabarets as that kept by the\r\nogress."\r\n\r\n"Had I not done so, I should not have had the pleasure of wandering in\r\nthe fields with you to-day, my dear Fleur-de-Marie."\r\n\r\n"That is, indeed, true, M. Rodolph; but, still, it does not alter my\r\nfirst opinion. No, much as I enjoy to-day\'s treat, I would cheerfully\r\ngive up all thoughts of ever passing such another if I thought it could\r\nin any way injure you."\r\n\r\n"Injure me! Far from it! Think of the excellent advice you have been\r\ngiving me."\r\n\r\n"Which you have promised me to follow?"\r\n\r\n"I have; and I pledge my word of honour to save henceforward at least\r\nforty sous a day." Thus speaking, Rodolph called out to the driver of\r\ntheir vehicle, who was passing the village of Sarcelles, "Take the first\r\nroad to the right, cross Villiers to Bel, turn to the left, then keep\r\nalong quite straight."\r\n\r\n"Now," said Rodolph, turning to his companion, "that I am a good boy,\r\nand promised to do all you tell me, let us go back to our diversion of\r\nbuilding castles in the air: that does not run away with much money. You\r\nwill not object to such a method of amusing myself, will you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, build as many as you like, they are very cheaply raised, and\r\nvery easily knocked down when you are tired of them. Now, then, you\r\nbegin."\r\n\r\n"Well, then--No! Fleur-de-Marie, you shall build up yours first."\r\n\r\n"I wonder if you could guess what I should choose, if wishing were all,\r\nM. Rodolph."\r\n\r\n"Let us try. Suppose that this road--I say _this_ road, because we\r\nhappen to be on it--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, of course; this road is as good as any other."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I say, I suppose that this road leads to a delightful\r\nlittle village, at a considerable distance from the highroad--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; that makes it so much more still and quiet!"\r\n\r\n"It is built facing the south, and half surrounded by trees--"\r\n\r\n"And close by flows a gentle river."\r\n\r\n"Exactly!--a clear, gently flowing river. At the end of this village\r\nstands a pretty farm, with a nice orchard on one side of it, and a\r\ngarden, filled with flowers, on the other--"\r\n\r\n"That farm shall be called my farm, to which we will pretend we are now\r\ngoing."\r\n\r\n"Just so."\r\n\r\n"And where we know we shall get some delicious milk to drink after our\r\njourney!"\r\n\r\n"Milk, indeed! Excellent cream, and newly laid eggs, if you please."\r\n\r\n"And where we would be glad to stay all our lives!"\r\n\r\n"All our lives! Quite right,--go on."\r\n\r\n"And then we should go and see all the cows!"\r\n\r\n"To be sure we should."\r\n\r\n"And afterwards visit the dairy?"\r\n\r\n"Visit the dairy! Yes."\r\n\r\n"Then the pigeon-house?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, so we should."\r\n\r\n"Oh, how very, very nice, only to think of such things!"\r\n\r\n"But let me finish the description of the farm--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, pray do! I quite forgot that."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, the ground floor contains two rooms; one, a large kitchen\r\nfor the farm servants, and the other for the owner of the place."\r\n\r\n"Make that room have green blinds, M. Rodolph,--do, pray; they are so\r\ncool, and look so pretty!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes,--green blinds to the windows. I quite agree with you,--they\r\ndo look uncommonly pretty, and set off a place so well! Of course, the\r\nperson tenanting this farm is your aunt."\r\n\r\n"Of course she is my aunt, and a very good, sensible, kind woman, M.\r\nRodolph, is she not?"\r\n\r\n"Particularly so, and loves you like her own child."\r\n\r\n"Dear, good aunt! Oh, how delightful to have some one to love us!"\r\n\r\n"And you return the tender affection she bears you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, with all my heart!" exclaimed Fleur-de-Marie, clasping her hands,\r\nand raising her eyes to heaven with an expression impossible to\r\ndescribe. "And I should help her to work, to attend to the family linen,\r\nto keep everything neat and clean, to store up the summer fruits against\r\nwinter--oh, she would never have to complain that I was idle, I promise!\r\nFirst of all, in the morning--"\r\n\r\n"Wait a bit, Fleur-de-Marie; you are in too great a hurry. I want to\r\nfinish describing the house to you; never mind your aunt just yet."\r\n\r\n"Ah, ha, Mr. Painter! All this is taken from some pretty landscape you\r\nhave been painting on a fan. Now I know what makes you so expert at\r\ndescribing it!" said La Goualeuse, laughing merrily at her own little\r\njest.\r\n\r\n"You little chatterer, be quiet, will you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am a chatterer, indeed, to interrupt you so often, M. Rodolph;\r\nbut pray go on, and I will not speak again till you have finished\r\npainting this dear farm."\r\n\r\n"Your room is on the first floor--"\r\n\r\n"My room! how charming! Oh, go on--go on, please, M. Rodolph, and\r\ndescribe all about it to me!" And the delighted girl opened her large\r\nlaughing eyes, and pressed more closely against Rodolph, as if she\r\nexpected to see the picture in his hand.\r\n\r\n"Your chamber has two windows looking out upon the flower garden, and a\r\nsmall meadow, watered by the river we mentioned. On the opposite bank of\r\nthe stream rises a small hill, planted with fine old chestnut-trees; and\r\nfrom amongst them peeps out the village church--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, how beautiful,--how very beautiful, M. Rodolph! It makes one quite\r\nlong to be there."\r\n\r\n"Three or four fine cows are grazing in the meadow, which is only\r\nseparated from the garden by a hedge of honeysuckle--"\r\n\r\n"And from my windows I can see the cows?"\r\n\r\n"Perfectly."\r\n\r\n"And one among them ought to be my favourite, you know, M. Rodolph; and\r\nI ought to put a little bell round its neck, and use it to feed out of\r\nmy hands!"\r\n\r\n"Of course she would come when you called her. Let me see, what name\r\nshall we give her? Suppose we say, Musette. Do you like that? She shall\r\nbe very young and gentle, and entirely white."\r\n\r\n"Oh, what a pretty name! Musette! Ah, Musette, Musette, I shall be\r\nalways feeding you and patting you to make you know me."\r\n\r\n"Now we will finish the inside of your apartment, Fleur-de-Marie. The\r\ncurtains and furniture are green, like the blinds; and outside the\r\nwindow grow an enormous rose-tree and honeysuckle, which entirely cover\r\nthis side of the farm, and so surround your casements that you have only\r\nto stretch out your hand to gather a large bunch of roses and\r\nhoneysuckle wet with the early morning dew."\r\n\r\n"Ah, M. Rodolph, what a good painter you are!"\r\n\r\n"Now this is the way you will pass your day--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, let us see how I shall employ myself all day."\r\n\r\n"Early in the morning your good aunt wakes you with a tender kiss; she\r\nbrings with her a bowl of new milk, just warm, which she prays you to\r\ndrink, as she fancies you are delicate about the lungs, poor dear child!\r\nWell, you do as she wishes you; then rise, and take a walk around the\r\nfarm; pay a visit to Musette, the poultry, your pets the pigeons, the\r\nflowers in the garden, till nine o\'clock, when your writing-master\r\narrives--"\r\n\r\n"My writing-master?"\r\n\r\n"Why, you know, unless you learned such necessary things as reading,\r\nwriting, and accounts, you would not be able to assist your aunt to keep\r\nher books relative to the produce of the farm."\r\n\r\n"Oh, to be sure! How very stupid of me not to recollect that I must\r\nlearn to write well, if I wished to help my aunt!" cried the young girl,\r\nso thoroughly absorbed in the picture of this peaceful life as to\r\nbelieve for the moment in its reality.\r\n\r\n"After your lesson is concluded, you will occupy yourself in household\r\nmatters, or embroider some pretty little article of dress for yourself;\r\nthen you will practise your writing for an hour or two, and, when that\r\nis done, join your aunt in her round of visits to the different\r\noperations of the farm; in the summer, to see how the reapers get on in\r\nthe hay field; in harvest-time, to observe the reapers, and afterwards\r\nto enjoy the delight with which the gleaners pick up the scattered ears\r\nof grain; by this time you will have almost tired yourself, and\r\ngathering a large handful of wild herbs, carefully selected by you as\r\nthe known favourites of your dear Musette, you turn your steps\r\nhomewards--"\r\n\r\n"But we go back through the meadow, dear M. Rodolph, do we not?"\r\ninquired La Goualeuse, as earnestly as though every syllable her ears\r\ndrank in was to be effectually brought to pass.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes! by all means; and there happens, fortunately, to be a nice\r\nlittle bridge, by which the river separating the farm-land from the\r\nmeadow may be crossed. By the time you reach home, upon my word, it is\r\nseven o\'clock; and, as the evenings begin to be a little chill, a\r\nbright, cheerful fire is blazing in the large farm kitchen; you go in\r\nthere for a few minutes, just to warm yourself and to speak a few kind\r\nwords to the honest labourers, who are enjoying a hearty meal after the\r\nday\'s toil is over. Then you sit down to dinner with your aunt;\r\nsometimes the cure, or a neighbouring farmer, is invited to share the\r\nmeal. After dinner you read or work, while your aunt and her guest have\r\na friendly game at piquet. At ten o\'clock she dismisses you, with a kiss\r\nand a blessing, to your chamber; you retire to your room, offer prayers\r\nand thanksgivings to the Great Author of all your happiness, then sleep\r\nsoundly till morning, when the same routine begins again."\r\n\r\n"Oh, M. Rodolph, one might lead such a life as that for a hundred years,\r\nwithout ever knowing one moment\'s weariness."\r\n\r\n"But that is not all. There are Sundays and fete-days to be thought of."\r\n\r\n"Yes; and how should we pass those?"\r\n\r\n"Why, you would put on your holiday dress, with one of those pretty\r\nlittle caps _a la paysanne_, which all admit you look so very nicely in,\r\nand accompany your aunt in her large old-fashioned chaise, driven by\r\nJames the farm servant, to hear mass in the village church; after which,\r\nduring summer, your kind relative would take you to the different fetes\r\ngiven in the adjoining parishes. You, so gentle, so modest and\r\ngood-looking, so tenderly beloved by your aunt, and so well spoken of by\r\nthe cure for all the virtues and qualifications which make a good wife,\r\nwill have no scarcity of offers for your hand in the dance,--indeed, all\r\nthe principal young farmers will be anxious to secure you as a partner,\r\nby way of opening an acquaintance which shall last for life. By degrees\r\nyou begin to remark one more than the others; you perceive his deep\r\ndesire to attract your undivided attention, and so--" And here Rodolph,\r\nstruck by the continued silence of La Goualeuse, looked up at her. Alas!\r\nthe poor girl was endeavouring, though fruitlessly, to choke the deep\r\nsobs which almost suffocated her. For a brief period, carried away by\r\nthe words of Rodolph, the bright future presented to her mental vision\r\nhad effaced the horrible present; but too quickly did the hideous\r\npicture return, and sweep away for ever the dear delight of believing so\r\nsweet, so calm an existence could ever be hers.\r\n\r\n"Fleur-de-Marie," asked Rodolph, in a kind and affectionate tone, "why\r\nis this? Why these tears?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, M. Rodolph, you have unintentionally caused me much pain. Foolish\r\ngirl that I was, I had listened to you till I quite fancied this\r\nparadise were a true picture."\r\n\r\n"And so it is, my dear child! This paradise, as you call it, is no\r\nfiction."\r\n\r\n"Stop, coachman!"\r\n\r\n"Now look! see! observe where we are!"\r\n\r\nAs the carriage stopped, La Goualeuse, at Rodolph\'s bidding,\r\nmechanically raised her head,--they were on the summit of a little\r\nhill. What was her surprise, her astonishment, at the scene which\r\nrevealed itself to her gaze! The pretty village, built facing the south,\r\nthe farm, the meadow, the beautiful cows, the little winding river, the\r\nchestnut grove, the church in the distance,--the whole picture, so\r\nvividly painted, was before her eyes. Nothing was wanting,--even the\r\nmilk-white heifer, Musette, her future pet, was peacefully grazing as\r\nshe had been described. The rich colouring of an October sun gilded the\r\ncharming landscape, while the variegated tint of the chestnut-leaves,\r\nslightly tinged by the autumnal breezes, stood out in bold relief\r\nagainst the clear blue of the surrounding sky.\r\n\r\n"Well, my little Fleur-de-Marie, what do you say to this? Am I a good\r\npainter, or not?"\r\n\r\nLa Goualeuse looked at him with a surprise in which a degree of\r\nuneasiness was mingled; all she saw and heard appeared to her to partake\r\nlargely of the supernatural.\r\n\r\n"M. Rodolph," she at length exclaimed, with a bewildered look, "how can\r\nthis be? Indeed, indeed, I feel afraid to look at it,--it is so exactly\r\nalike. I cannot believe it is anything but a dream you have conjured up,\r\nand which will quickly pass away. Speak to me! pray do; and tell me what\r\nto believe."\r\n\r\n"Calm yourself, my dear child! Nothing is more simple or true than what\r\nyou behold here. The good woman who owns this farm was my nurse, and\r\nbrought me up here; intending to give myself a treat, I sent to her\r\nearly this morning to say I was coming to see her. You see I painted\r\nafter nature."\r\n\r\n"You are quite right, M. Rodolph," sighed La Goualeuse. "There is,\r\nindeed, nothing but what is quite natural in all this."\r\n\r\nThe farm to which Rodolph had conducted Fleur-de-Marie was situated at\r\nthe outer extremity of the village of Bouqueval,--a small, isolated, and\r\nunknown hamlet, entirely surrounded by its own lands, and about two\r\nleagues\' distance from Ecouen; the vehicle, following the directions of\r\nRodolph, rapidly descended the hill, and entered a long avenue bordered\r\nwith apple and cherry trees, while the wheels rolled noiselessly over\r\nthe short fine grass with which the unfrequented road was overgrown.\r\n\r\nFleur-de-Marie, whose utmost efforts were unavailing to shake off the\r\npainful sensations she experienced, remained so silent and mournful that\r\nRodolph reproached himself with having, by his well-intentioned\r\nsurprise, been the cause of it. In a few moments more, the carriage,\r\npassing by the large entrance to the farm, entered a thick avenue of\r\nelm-trees, and stopped before a little rustic porch, half hidden by the\r\nluxuriant branches of the vine which clustered round it.\r\n\r\n"Now, Fleur-de-Marie, here we are. Are you pleased with what you see?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I am, M. Rodolph. But how shall I venture before the good person\r\nyou mentioned as living here? Pray do not let her see me,--I cannot\r\nventure to approach her."\r\n\r\n"And why, my child?"\r\n\r\n"True, M. Rodolph; I forget she does not know me, and will not guess how\r\nunworthy I am." And poor Fleur-de-Marie tried to suppress the deep sigh\r\nthat would accompany her words.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Rodolph had, no doubt, been watched for; the driver had\r\nscarcely opened the carriage door when a prepossessing female, of middle\r\nage, dressed in the style of wealthy landholders about Paris, and whose\r\ncountenance, though melancholy, was also gentle and benevolent in its\r\nexpression, appeared in the porch, and with respectful eagerness\r\nadvanced to meet Rodolph.\r\n\r\nPoor Goualeuse felt her cheeks flush and her heart beat as she timidly\r\ndescended from the vehicle.\r\n\r\n"Good day, good day, Madame Georges," said Rodolph, advancing towards\r\nthe individual so addressed, "you see I am punctual." Then turning to\r\nthe driver, and putting money into his hand, he said, "Here, my friend,\r\nthere is no further occasion to detain you; you may return to Paris as\r\nsoon as you please."\r\n\r\nThe coachman, a little, short, square-built man, with his hat over his\r\neyes, and his countenance almost entirely concealed by the high collar\r\nof his driving-coat, pocketed the money without a word, remounted his\r\nseat, gave his horses the whip, and disappeared down the _allee verte_\r\nby which he had entered.\r\n\r\nFleur-de-Marie sprang to the side of Rodolph, and with an air of\r\nunfeigned alarm, almost amounting to distress, said, in a tone so low as\r\nnot to be overheard by Madame Georges:\r\n\r\n"M. Rodolph! M. Rodolph! pray do not be angry, but why have you sent\r\naway the carriage? Will it not return to fetch us away?"\r\n\r\n"Of course not; I have quite done with the man, and therefore dismissed\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"But the ogress!"\r\n\r\n"What of her? Why do you mention her name?"\r\n\r\n"Alas! alas! because I must return to her this evening; indeed, indeed,\r\nI must, or--or she will consider me a thief. The very clothes I have on\r\nare hers, and, besides, I owe her--"\r\n\r\n"Make yourself quite easy, my dear child; it is my part to ask your\r\nforgiveness, not you mine."\r\n\r\n"My forgiveness! Oh, for what can you require me to pardon you?"\r\n\r\n"For not having sooner told you that you no longer owe the ogress\r\nanything; that it rests only with yourself to decide whether you will\r\nhenceforward make this quiet spot your home, and cast off the garments\r\nyou now wear for others my kind friend, Madame Georges, will furnish you\r\nwith. She is much about your height, and can supply you with everything\r\nyou require. She is all impatience to commence her part of \'aunt,\' I\r\ncan assure you."\r\n\r\nPoor Fleur-de-Marie seemed utterly unable to comprehend the meaning of\r\nall she saw and heard, and gazed with wondering and perplexed looks from\r\none companion to the other, as though fearing to trust either her eyes\r\nor ears.\r\n\r\n"Do I understand you rightly?" she cried at length, half breathless with\r\nemotion. "Not go back to Paris? Remain here? And this lady will permit\r\nme to stay with her? Oh, it cannot be possible; I dare not hope it; that\r\nwould, indeed, be to realise our \'castles in the air.\'"\r\n\r\n"Dear Fleur-de-Marie, your wishes are realised,--your dream a true one."\r\n\r\n"No, no, you must be jesting; that would be too much happiness to\r\nexpect, or even dare to hope for."\r\n\r\n"Nay, Fleur-de-Marie, we should never find fault with an oversupply of\r\nhappiness."\r\n\r\n"Ah, M. Rodolph, for pity\'s sake deceive me not; you cannot believe the\r\nmisery I should experience were you to tell me all this happiness was\r\nbut a jest."\r\n\r\n"My child, listen to me," said Rodolph, with a tone and manner which,\r\nalthough still affectionate, was mingled with a dignified accent and\r\nmanner Fleur-de-Marie had never previously remarked in him. "I repeat\r\nthat, if you please, you may from this very hour lead here, with Madame\r\nGeorges, that peaceful life whose description but a short time since so\r\nmuch delighted you. Though the kind lady with whom you will reside be\r\nnot your aunt, she will feel for you the most lively and affectionate\r\ninterest, and with the personages about the farm you will pass as being\r\nreally and truly her niece, and this innocent deception will render your\r\nresidence here more agreeable and advantageous. Once more I repeat to\r\nyou, Fleur-de-Marie, you may now at your own pleasure realise the dream\r\nof our journey. As soon as you have assumed your village dress," said\r\nRodolph, smilingly, "we will take you to see that milk-white heifer,\r\nMusette, who is to be your favourite henceforward, and who is only\r\nwaiting for the pretty collar you designed to ornament her with; then we\r\nwill go and introduce ourselves to your pets, the pigeons, afterwards\r\nvisit the dairy, and so go on till we have been all over the farm. I\r\nmean to keep my promise in every respect, I assure you."\r\n\r\nFleur-de-Marie pressed her hands together with earnest gratitude.\r\nSurprise, joy, and the deepest thankfulness, mingled with respect, lit\r\nup her beautiful countenance, while, with eyes streaming with tears, she\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n"M. Rodolph, you are, you must be, one of those beneficent angels sent\r\nby the Almighty to do good upon earth, and to rescue poor fallen\r\ncreatures, like myself, from shame and misery."\r\n\r\n"My poor girl," replied Rodolph, with a smile of deep sadness and\r\nineffable kindness, "though still young, I have already deeply suffered.\r\nI lost a dear child, who, if living, would now be about your age. Let\r\nthat explain my deep sympathy with all who suffer, and for yourself\r\nparticularly, Fleur-de-Marie, or, rather, _Marie_ only. Now, go with\r\nMadame Georges, who will shew you the pretty chamber, with its\r\nclustering roses and honeysuckle to form your morning bouquets. Yes,\r\nMarie, henceforward let that name, simple and sweet as yourself, be your\r\nonly appellation. Before my departure we will have some talk together,\r\nand then I shall quit you, most happy in the knowledge of your full\r\ncontentment."\r\n\r\nFleur-de-Marie, without one word of reply, gracefully bent her knee,\r\nand, before Rodolph could prevent her, gently and respectfully raised\r\nhis hand to her lips; then rising with an air of modest submission,\r\nfollowed Madame Georges, who eyed her with a profound interest, out of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nMURPHY AND RODOLPH.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon quitting the house, Rodolph bent his steps towards the farmyard,\r\nwhere he found the individual who, the preceding evening, disguised as a\r\ncharcoal-man, had warned him of the arrival of Tom and Sarah. Murphy,\r\nwhich was the name of this personage, was about fifty years of age; his\r\nhead, nearly bald, was still ornamented with a fringe of light brown\r\nhair at each side, which the hand of time had here and there slightly\r\ntinged with gray; his face was broad, open, and ruddy, and free from all\r\nappearance of hair, except very short whiskers, of a reddish colour,\r\nonly reaching as low as the tip of the ear, from which it diverged, and\r\nstretched itself in a gentle curve across his rubicund cheeks. Spite of\r\nhis years and _embonpoint_, Murphy was active and athletic; his\r\ncountenance, though somewhat phlegmatic, was expressive of great\r\nresolution and kindliness of nature; he wore a white neck-handkerchief,\r\na deep waistcoat, and a long black coat, with very wide skirts; his\r\nbreeches, of an olive green colour, corresponded in material with the\r\ngaiters which protected his sturdy legs, without reaching entirely to\r\nthe knee, but allowing the strings belonging to his upper garment to\r\ndisplay themselves in long unstudied bows; in fact, the dress and whole\r\n_tournure_ of Murphy exactly accorded with the idea of what in England\r\nis styled a "gentleman farmer." Now, the personage we are describing,\r\nthough an English squire, was no farmer. At the moment of Rodolph\'s\r\nappearance in the yard, Murphy was in the act of depositing, in the\r\npocket of a small travelling _caleche_, a pair of small pistols he had\r\njust been carefully cleaning.\r\n\r\n"What the devil are you going to do with those pistols?" inquired\r\nRodolph.\r\n\r\n"That is my business, my lord," replied Murphy, descending the carriage\r\nsteps; "attend to your affairs, and I will mind mine."\r\n\r\n"At what o\'clock have you ordered the horses?"\r\n\r\n"According to your directions,--at nightfall."\r\n\r\n"You got here this morning, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"I did, at eight o\'clock. Madame Georges has had ample time to make all\r\nthe preparations you desired."\r\n\r\n"What has gone wrong, Murphy? You seem completely out of humour. Have I\r\ndone anything to offend you?"\r\n\r\n"Can you not, my lord, accomplish your self-imposed task without\r\nincurring so much personal risk?"\r\n\r\n"Surely, in order to lull all suspicion in the minds of the persons I\r\nseek to understand and fully appreciate, I cannot do better than, for a\r\ntime, to adopt their garb, their language, and their customs."\r\n\r\n"But all this did not prevent you, my lord, last night (in that\r\nabominable place where we went to unkennel Bras Rouge, in hopes of\r\ngetting out of him some particulars relative to that unhappy son of\r\nMadame Georges), from being angry, and ready to quarrel with me, because\r\nI wished to aid in your tussle with the rascal you encountered in that\r\nhorrid cut-throat alley."\r\n\r\n"I suppose, then, Murphy, you do not think I am capable of defending\r\nmyself, and you either doubt my courage or the strength of my arm?"\r\n\r\n"Unfortunately, you have given me too many reasons to form a contrary\r\nopinion of both. Thank God! Flatman, the Bertrand of Germany, perfected\r\nyou in the knowledge of fencing; Tom Cribb taught you to box; Lacour, of\r\nParis, accomplished you in single-stick, wrestling, and slang, so as to\r\nrender you fully provided for your venturesome excursions. You are bold\r\nas a lion, with muscles like iron, and, though so slight in form, I\r\nshould have no more chance with you than a dray-horse would against a\r\nracer, were they to compete with each other. No mistake about that."\r\n\r\n"Then what are you afraid of?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I maintain, my lord, that it is not the right thing for you to\r\nthrow yourself in the way of all these blackguards. I do not say that\r\nbecause of the nuisance it is to a highly respectable individual of my\r\nacquaintance to blacken his face with charcoal, and make himself look\r\nlike a devil. No, God knows, spite of my age, my figure, and my gravity,\r\nI would disguise myself as a rope-dancer, if, by so doing, I could serve\r\nyou. But I still stick to what I say, and--"\r\n\r\n"Oh! I know all you would say, my excellent old fellow, and that when\r\nonce you have taken an idea into your thick skull, the very devil\r\nhimself could no more drive it out of you than he could, by all his\r\narts, remove the fidelity and devotion implanted in your brave and\r\nvaliant heart."\r\n\r\n"Come, come, my lord, now you begin to flatter me, I suspect you are up\r\nto some fresh mischief."\r\n\r\n"Think no such thing, Murphy; give yourself no uneasiness, but leave all\r\nto me."\r\n\r\n"My lord, I cannot be easy; there is some new folly in hand, and I am\r\nsure of it."\r\n\r\n"My good friend, you mean well; but you are choosing a very ill hour for\r\nyour lectures; forbear, I beg."\r\n\r\n"And why, my lord, can you not listen to me now, as well as any other\r\ntime?"\r\n\r\n"Because you are interfering with one of my short-lived moments of pride\r\nand happiness. I am here, in this dear spot!"\r\n\r\n"Where you have done so much good. I know it. Your \'model farm,\' as you\r\nterm it, built by you to instruct, to encourage, and to reward deserving\r\nlabourers, has been of incalculable service to this part of the country.\r\nOrdinary men think but of improving their cattle; you, more wisely and\r\nbenevolently, have directed your exertions for the bettering your fellow\r\ncreatures. Nothing can be better; and when you placed Madame Georges at\r\nthe head of the establishment, you acted with the utmost wisdom and\r\nprovident good sense. What a woman she is! No, she is an angel!--so\r\ngood, so firm, so noble, and upright! I am not easily moved, my lord, as\r\nyou know; but often have I felt my eyes grow moist, as her many trials\r\nand misfortunes rise to my recollection. But about your new protegee,\r\nhowever, my lord; if you please, we will not say much on that subject.\r\n\'The least said is soonest mended,\' as the old proverb has it."\r\n\r\n"Why not, Murphy?"\r\n\r\n"My lord, you will do what you think proper."\r\n\r\n"I do what is just," said Rodolph, with an air of impatience.\r\n\r\n"What is just, according to your own interpretation."\r\n\r\n"What is just before God and my own conscience," replied Rodolph, in a\r\nsevere tone.\r\n\r\n"Well, my lord, this is a point on which we cannot agree, and therefore\r\nlet us speak no more about it."\r\n\r\n"I desire you will continue to talk about it!" cried Rodolph,\r\nimperiously.\r\n\r\n"I have never been so circumstanced that your royal highness should have\r\nto bid me hold my tongue, and I hope I shall not now be ordered to speak\r\nwhen I should be silent," said Murphy, proudly.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Murphy!" said Rodolph, with a tone of increased irritation.\r\n\r\n"My lord!"\r\n\r\n"You know, sir, how greatly I detest anything like concealment."\r\n\r\n"Your royal highness will excuse me, but it suits me to have certain\r\nconcealments," said Murphy, bluntly.\r\n\r\n"If I descend to familiarity with you, sir, it is on condition that you,\r\nat least, act with entire frankness towards me."\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe the extreme hauteur which marked the\r\ncountenance of Rodolph as he uttered these words.\r\n\r\n"I am fifty years of age, I am a gentleman, and your royal highness\r\nshould not address me in such a tone."\r\n\r\n"Be silent!"\r\n\r\n"My lord!"\r\n\r\n"Be silent! I say."\r\n\r\n"Your royal highness does wrong in compelling a man of honour and\r\nfeeling to recall the services he has rendered to you," said the squire,\r\nin a calm tone.\r\n\r\n"Have I not repaid those services in a thousand ways?"\r\n\r\nIt should be stated that Rodolph had not attached to these bitter words\r\nthe humiliating sense which could place Murphy in the light of a\r\nmercenary; but such, unfortunately, was the esquire\'s interpretation of\r\nthem. He became purple with shame, lifted his two clenched hands to his\r\nforehead with an expression of deep grief and indignation, and then, in\r\na moment, as by a sudden revulsion of feeling, throwing his eyes on\r\nRodolph, whose noble countenance was convulsed by the violence of\r\nextreme disdain, he said, in a faltering voice, and stifling a sigh of\r\nthe tenderest pity, "My lord, be yourself; you surpass the bounds of\r\nreason."\r\n\r\nThese words impelled Rodolph to the very height of irritation; his\r\nglance had even a savage glare in it; his lips were blanched; and,\r\nadvancing towards Murphy with a threatening aspect, he exclaimed, "Dare\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\nMurphy retreated, and said, in a quick tone, and as if in spite of\r\nhimself, "My lord, my lord, _remember the thirteenth of January!_"\r\n\r\nThese words produced a magical effect on Rodolph. His countenance,\r\ncontracted by anger, now expanded. He looked at Murphy steadfastly,\r\nbowed his head, and then, after a moment\'s silence, murmured, in\r\nfaltering accents, "Ah, sir, you are now cruel, indeed. I had thought\r\nthat my repentance--my deep remorse--and yet it is you--you--"\r\n\r\nRodolph could not finish; his voice was stifled; he sunk, subdued, on a\r\nstone bench, and concealed his countenance with both his hands.\r\n\r\n"My lord," said Murphy, in deep distress, "my good lord, forgive me!\r\nForgive your old and faithful Murphy. It was only when driven to an\r\nextremity, and fearing, alas! not for myself, but for you, the\r\nconsequences of your passion, that I uttered those words. I said them in\r\nspite of myself, and with sorrow. My lord, I was wrong to be so\r\nsensitive. _Mon Dieu!_ who can know your character, your feelings, if I\r\ndo not,--I, who have never left you from your childhood! Pray, oh, pray\r\nsay that you forgive me for having called to your recollection that sad,\r\nsad day. Alas! what expiations have you not made--"\r\n\r\nRodolph raised his head; he was very pale, and said to his companion, in\r\na gentle and saddened voice, "Enough, enough, my old friend; I thank you\r\nfor having, by one word, checked my headlong passion. I make no\r\napologies to you for the severe things I have said; you know well that\r\n\'it is a long way from the heart to the lips,\' as the good people at\r\nhome say. I was wrong; let us say no more on the subject."\r\n\r\n"Alas! now we shall be out of spirits for a long time, as if I were not\r\nsufficiently unhappy! I only wished to see you roused from your low\r\nspirits, and yet I add to them by my foolish tenaciousness. Good Heaven!\r\nwhat\'s the use of being an honest man, and having gray hairs, if it does\r\nnot enable us to endure reproaches which we do not deserve?"\r\n\r\n"Be it so, be it so; we were both in the wrong, my good friend," said\r\nRodolph, mildly; "let us forget it, and return to our former\r\nconversation. You approved entirely of my establishment of this farm,\r\nand the deep interest I have always felt in Madame Georges. You will\r\nallow, won\'t you, that she had merited it by her excellent qualities,\r\nher misfortunes, even if she did not belong to the family of\r\nHarville,--a family to which my father had vowed eternal gratitude."\r\n\r\n"I have always approved of the sentiments which your lordship has\r\nentertained for Madame Georges."\r\n\r\n"But you are astonished at the interest I take in this poor girl, are\r\nyou not?"\r\n\r\n"Pray, pray, my lord, I was wrong; I was wrong."\r\n\r\n"No, I can imagine that appearances have deceived you; but, as you know\r\nmy life--all my life, and as you aid me always with as much fidelity as\r\ncourage in my self-inflicted expiation, it is my duty, or, if you like\r\nthe phrase better, my gratitude, to convince you that I am not acting\r\nfrom a frivolous impulse."\r\n\r\n"Of that I am sure, my lord."\r\n\r\n"You know my ideas on the subject of the good which a man ought to do\r\nwho has the knowledge, the will, and the power. To succour unhappy, but\r\ndeserving, fellow creatures is well; to seek after those who are\r\nstruggling against misfortune with energy and honour, and to aid them,\r\nsometimes without their knowledge,--to prevent, in right time, misery\r\nand temptation, is better; to reinstate such perfectly in their own\r\nestimation,---to lead back to honesty those who have preserved in purity\r\nsome generous and ennobling sentiments in the midst of the contempt that\r\nwithers them, the misery that eats into them, the corruption that\r\nencircles them, and, for that end, to brave, in person, this misery,\r\nthis corruption, this contagion, is better still; to pursue, with\r\nunalterable hatred, with implacable vengeance, vice, infamy, and crime,\r\nwhether they be trampling in the mud, or be clothed in purple and fine\r\nlinen, that is justice; but to give aid inconsiderately to well-merited\r\ndegradation, to prostitute and lavish charity and commiseration, by\r\nbestowing help on unworthy and undeserving objects, is most infamous; it\r\nis impiety,--very sacrilege! it is to doubt the existence of the\r\nAlmighty; and so, he who acts thus ought to be made to understand."\r\n\r\n"My lord, I pray you do not think that I would for a moment assert that\r\nyou have bestowed your benefits unworthily."\r\n\r\n"One word more, my old friend. You know well that the child whose death\r\nI daily deplore--that that daughter whom I should have loved the more,\r\nas her unworthy mother, Sarah, had shown herself so utterly indifferent\r\nabout her--would have been sixteen years of age, like this unhappy girl.\r\nYou know, too, that I cannot prevent the deep, and almost painful,\r\nsympathy I feel for young girls of that age."\r\n\r\n"True, my lord; and I ought so to have interpreted the interest you\r\nevince for your protegee. Besides, to succour the unfortunate is to\r\nhonour God."\r\n\r\n"It is, my friend, when the objects deserve it; and thus nothing is more\r\nworthy of compassion and respect than a woman like Madame Georges, who,\r\nbrought up by a pious and good mother in the strict observance of all\r\nher duties, has never failed,--never! and has, moreover, courageously\r\nborne herself in the midst of the most severe trials. But is it not to\r\nhonour God in the most acceptable way, to raise from the dust one of\r\nthose beings of the finest mould, whom he has been pleased to endow\r\nrichly? Does not she deserve compassion and respect,--yes,\r\nrespect,--who, unhappy girl! abandoned to her own instinct,--who,\r\ntortured, imprisoned, degraded, sullied, has yet preserved, in holiness\r\nand pureness of heart, those noble germs of good first implanted by the\r\nAlmighty? If you had but seen, poor child! how, at the first word of\r\ninterest expressed for her,--the first mark of kindness and right\r\nfeeling,--the most charming natural impulses, the purest tastes, the\r\nmost refined thoughts, the most poetic ideas, developed themselves\r\nabundantly in her ingenuous mind, even as, in the early spring, a\r\nthousand wild flowers lift up their heads at the first rays of the sun!\r\nIn a conversation of about an hour with Fleur-de-Marie, I have\r\ndiscovered treasures of goodness, worth, prudence,--yes, prudence, old\r\nMurphy. A smile came to my lips, and a tear in my eye, when, in her\r\ngentle and sensible prattle, she urged on me the necessity of saving\r\nforty sous a day, that I might be beyond want or evil temptations. Poor\r\nlittle creature! she said all this with so serious and persuasive a\r\ntone. She seemed so delighted to give me good advice, and experienced so\r\nextreme a pleasure in hearing me promise to follow it! I was moved even\r\nto tears; and you,--it affects you, my old friend."\r\n\r\n"It does, my lord; the idea of making you lay by forty sous a day,\r\nthinking you a workman, instead of urging you to spend money on her;\r\nthat does touch me."\r\n\r\n"Hush; here are Madame Georges and Marie. Get all ready for our\r\ndeparture; we must be in Paris in good time."\r\n\r\nThanks to the care of Madame Georges, Fleur-de-Marie was no longer like\r\nher former self. A pretty peasant\'s cap, and two thick braids of light\r\nbrown hair, encircled her charming face. A large handkerchief of white\r\nmuslin crossed her bosom, and disappeared under the high fold of a small\r\nshot taffetas apron, whose blue and red shades appeared to advantage\r\nover a dark nun\'s dress, which seemed expressly made for her. The young\r\ngirl\'s countenance was calm and composed. Certain feelings of delight\r\nproduce in the mind an unspeakable sadness,--a holy melancholy. Rodolph\r\nwas not surprised at the gravity of Fleur-de-Marie; he had expected it.\r\nHad she been merry and talkative, she would not have retained so high a\r\nplace in his good opinion. In the serious and resigned countenance of\r\nMadame Georges might easily be traced the indelible marks of\r\nlong-suffering; but she looked at Fleur-de-Marie with a tenderness and\r\ncompassion quite maternal, so much gentleness and sweetness did this\r\npoor girl evince.\r\n\r\n"Here is my child, who has come to thank you for your goodness, M.\r\nRodolph," said Madame Georges, presenting Goualeuse to Rodolph.\r\n\r\nAt the words, "my child," Goualeuse turned her large eyes slowly towards\r\nher protectress, and contemplated her for some moments with a look of\r\nunutterable gratitude.\r\n\r\n"Thanks for Marie, my dear Madame Georges; she deserves this kind\r\ninterest, and always will deserve it."\r\n\r\n"M. Rodolph," said Goualeuse, with a trembling voice, "you understand, I\r\nknow, I feel that you do, that I cannot find anything to say to you."\r\n\r\n"Your emotion tells me all, my child."\r\n\r\n"Oh, she feels deeply the good fortune that has come to her so\r\nprovidentially," said Madame Georges, deeply affected; "her first\r\nimpulse on entering my room was to prostrate herself before my\r\ncrucifix."\r\n\r\n"Because now, thanks to you, M. Rodolph, I dare to pray," said\r\nGoualeuse.\r\n\r\nMurphy turned away hastily; his pretensions to firmness would not allow\r\nof any one seeing to what extent the simple words of Goualeuse had\r\ntouched him.\r\n\r\nRodolph said to her, "My child, I wish to have some conversation with\r\nMadame Georges. My friend Murphy will lead you over the farm, and\r\nintroduce you to your future proteges. We will join you presently. Well,\r\nMurphy, Murphy, don\'t you hear me?"\r\n\r\nThe worthy gentleman turned his back, and pretended to blow his nose\r\nwith a very loud noise, then put his handkerchief in his pocket, pulled\r\nhis hat over his eyes, and, turning half around, offered his arm to\r\nMarie, managing so skilfully that neither Rodolph nor Madame Georges\r\ncould see his face. Taking the arm of Marie, he walked away with her\r\ntowards the farm buildings, and so quickly, that, to keep up with him,\r\nGoualeuse was obliged to run, as in her infant days she ran beside the\r\nChouette.\r\n\r\n"Well, Madame Georges, what do you think of Marie?" inquired Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"M. Rodolph, I have told you: she had scarcely entered my room, when,\r\nseeing the crucifix, she fell on her knees before it. It is impossible\r\nfor me to tell you, to describe the spontaneous and naturally religious\r\nfeeling that evidently dictated this. I saw in an instant that hers was\r\nno degraded soul. And then, M. Rodolph, the expression of her gratitude\r\nto you had nothing exaggerated in it; but it is not the less sincere.\r\nAnd I have another proof of how natural and potent is this religious\r\ninstinct in her. I said to her, \'You must have been much astonished, and\r\nvery happy, when M. Rodolph told you that you were to remain here for\r\nthe future? What an effect it must have had on you!\' \'Yes, oh, yes,\' was\r\nher reply; \'when M. Rodolph told me so, I cannot describe what passed\r\nwithin me; but I felt that kind of holy happiness which I experience in\r\ngoing into a church. When I could go there,\' she added, \'for you know,\r\nmadame--\' \'I know, my child, for I shall always call you my child (I\r\ncould not let her go on when I saw her cover her face for shame), I know\r\nthat you have suffered deeply; but God blesses those who love and fear\r\nhim, those who have been unhappy, and those who repent.\'"\r\n\r\n"Then, my good Madame Georges, I am doubly happy at what I have done.\r\nThis poor girl will greatly interest you, her disposition is so\r\nexcellent, her instincts so right."\r\n\r\n"What has besides affected me, M. Rodolph, is that she has not allowed\r\none single question to escape her about you, although her curiosity\r\nmust be so much excited. Struck with a reserve so full of delicacy, I\r\nwished to know what she felt. I said to her, \'You must be very curious\r\nto know who your mysterious benefactor is?\' \'Know him!\' she replied,\r\nwith delightful simplicity; \'he is my benefactor.\'"\r\n\r\n"Then you will love her. Excellent woman! she will find some interest in\r\nyour heart."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I shall occupy my heart with her as I should with _him_," said\r\nMadame Georges, in a broken voice.\r\n\r\nRodolph took her hand.\r\n\r\n"Do not be discouraged; come, come, if our search has been unsuccessful\r\nso far, yet one day, perhaps--"\r\n\r\nMadame Georges shook her head sorrowfully, and said, in bitter accents,\r\n"My poor son would be now twenty years old!"\r\n\r\n"Say he is that age--"\r\n\r\n"God hear you, and grant it, M. Rodolph."\r\n\r\n"He will hear, I fully believe. Yesterday I went (but in vain) to find a\r\ncertain fellow called Bras Rouge who might, perhaps, have given me some\r\ninformation about your son. Coming away from this Bras Rouge\'s abode,\r\nafter a struggle in which I was engaged, I met with this unfortunate\r\ngirl--"\r\n\r\n"Alas! but your kind endeavour in my behalf has thrown in your way\r\nanother unfortunate being, M. Rodolph."\r\n\r\n"You have no intelligence from Rochefort?"\r\n\r\n"None," said Madame Georges, shuddering, and in a low voice.\r\n\r\n"So much the better! We can no longer doubt but that the monster met his\r\ndeath in the attempt to escape from the--"\r\n\r\nRodolph hesitated to pronounce the horrible word.\r\n\r\n"From the Bagne? Oh, say it!--the Bagne!" exclaimed the wretched woman\r\nwith horror, and almost frantic as she spoke. "The father of my child!\r\nAh! if the unhappy boy still lives--if, like me, he has not changed his\r\nname--oh, shame! shame! And yet it may be nothing: his father has,\r\nperhaps, carried out his horrid threat! What has he done with my boy?\r\nWhy did he tear him from me?"\r\n\r\n"That mystery I cannot fathom," said Rodolph, with a pensive air. "What\r\ncould induce the wretch to carry off your son fifteen years ago, and\r\nwhen he was trying to escape into a foreign land? A child of that age\r\ncould only embarrass his flight."\r\n\r\n"Alas, M. Rodolph! when my husband" (the poor woman shuddered as she\r\npronounced the word) "was arrested on the frontier and thrown into\r\nprison, where I was allowed to visit him, he said to me these horrible\r\nwords: \'I took away the brat because you were fond of him, and it will\r\nbe a means of compelling you to send me money, which may or may not be\r\nof service to him,--that\'s my affair. Whether he lives or dies it is no\r\nmatter to you; but if he lives, he will be in good hands: you shall\r\ndrink as deep of the shame of the son as you have of the disgrace of the\r\nfather!\' Alas! a month afterwards my husband was condemned to the\r\ngalleys for life; and since then all my entreaties, my prayers, and\r\nletters have been in vain. I have never been able to learn the fate of\r\nmy boy. Ah, M. Rodolph! where is my child at this moment? These\r\nfrightful words are always ringing in my ears: \'You shall drink as deep\r\nof the shame of the son as you have of the disgrace of the father!\'"\r\n\r\n"This atrocity is most inexplicable; why should he demoralise the\r\nunhappy child? Why carry him off?"\r\n\r\n"I have told you, M. Rodolph,--to compel me to send him money; although\r\nhe had nearly ruined me, yet I had still some small resources, but they\r\nat length were exhausted also. In spite of his wickedness, I could not\r\nbelieve but that he would employ, at least, a portion of this money in\r\nthe bringing-up of this unhappy child."\r\n\r\n"And your son had no sign, no mark, by which he could be recognised?"\r\n\r\n"No other than that of which I have spoken to you, M. Rodolph,--a small\r\nSaint Esprit, sculptured in lapis lazuli, tied round his neck by a chain\r\nof silver: a sacred relic, blessed by the holy father."\r\n\r\n"Courage, courage; God is all-powerful."\r\n\r\n"Providence placed me in your path, M. Rodolph."\r\n\r\n"Too late, Madame Georges; too late. I might have saved you many years\r\nof sorrow."\r\n\r\n"Ah, M. Rodolph, how kind you have been to me!"\r\n\r\n"In what way? I bought this farm; in time of your prosperity you were\r\nnot idle, and now you have become my manager here, where--thanks to your\r\nexcellent superintendence, intelligence, and activity--this\r\nestablishment produces me--"\r\n\r\n"Produces you, my lord?" said Madame Georges, interrupting Rodolph;\r\n"why, all the returns are employed, not only in ameliorating the\r\ncondition of the labourers, who consider the occupation on this model\r\nfarm as a great favour, but, moreover, to succour all the needy in the\r\ndistrict; through the mediation of our good Abbe Laporte--"\r\n\r\n"Ah, the dear abbe!" said Rodolph, desirous of escaping the praise of\r\nMadame Georges; "have you had the kindness to inform him of my arrival?\r\nI wish to recommend my protegee to him. He has had my letter?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Murphy gave it to him when he came this morning."\r\n\r\n"In that letter I told our good cure, in a few words, the history of\r\nthis poor girl. I was not sure that I should be able to come to-day\r\nmyself, and if not, then Murphy would have conducted Marie--"\r\n\r\nA labourer of the farm interrupted this conversation, which had been\r\ncarried on in the garden.\r\n\r\n"Madame, M. le Cure is waiting for you."\r\n\r\n"Are the post-horses arrived, my lad?" inquired Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"Yes, M. Rodolph; and they are putting to." And the man left the garden.\r\n\r\nMadame Georges, the cure, and the inhabitants of the farm only knew\r\nFleur-de-Marie\'s protector as M. Rodolph. Murphy\'s discretion was\r\nfaultless; and although when in private he was very precise in\r\n"my-lording" Rodolph, yet before strangers he was very careful not to\r\naddress him otherwise than as _M. Rodolph_.\r\n\r\n"I forgot to mention, my dear Madame Georges," said Rodolph, when he\r\nreturned to the house, "that Marie has, I fear, very weak\r\nlungs,--privations and misery have tried her health. This morning early\r\nI was struck with the pallor of her countenance, although her cheeks\r\nwere of a deep rose colour; her eyes, too, seem to me to have a\r\nbrilliancy which betokens a feverish system. Great care must be taken of\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"Rely on me, M. Rodolph; but, thank God! there is nothing serious to\r\napprehend. At her age, in the country, with pure air, rest, and quiet,\r\nshe will soon be quite restored."\r\n\r\n"I hope so; but I will not trust to your country doctors. I will desire\r\nMurphy to bring here my medical man,--a negro,--a very skilful person,\r\nwho will tell you the best regimen to pursue. You must send me news of\r\nMarie very often. Some time hence, when she shall be better, and more at\r\nease, we will talk about her future life; perhaps it would be best that\r\nshe always remained with you, if you were pleased with her."\r\n\r\n"I should like it greatly, M. Rodolph; she would supply the place of the\r\nchild I have lost, and must for ever bewail."\r\n\r\n"Let us still hope for you and for her."\r\n\r\nAt the moment when Rodolph and Madame Georges approached the farm,\r\nMurphy and Marie also entered. The worthy gentleman let go the arm of\r\nGoualeuse, and said to Rodolph in a low voice, and with an air of some\r\nconfusion:\r\n\r\n"This girl has bewitched me; I really do not know which interests me\r\nmost, she or Madame Georges. I was a brute--a beast!"\r\n\r\n"I knew, old Murphy, that you would do justice to my protegee," said\r\nRodolph, smiling, and shaking hands with the squire.\r\n\r\nMadame Georges, leaning on Marie\'s arm, entered with her into a small\r\nroom on the ground floor, where the Abbe Laporte was waiting. Murphy\r\nwent away, to see all ready for their departure. Madame Georges, Marie,\r\nRodolph, and the cure remained together.\r\n\r\nPlain, but very comfortable, this small apartment was fitted up with\r\ngreen hangings, like the rest of the house, as had been exactly\r\ndescribed to Goualeuse by Rodolph. A thick carpet covered the floor, a\r\ngood fire burnt in the grate, and two large nosegays of daisies of all\r\ncolours, placed in two crystal vases, shed their agreeable odour\r\nthroughout the room. Through the windows, with their green blinds, which\r\nwere half opened, was to be seen the meadow, the little stream, and,\r\nbeyond it, the bank planted with chestnut-trees.\r\n\r\nThe Abbe Laporte, who was seated near the fireplace, was upwards of\r\neighty years of age, and had, ever since the last days of the\r\nRevolution, done duty in this small parish. Nothing can be imagined more\r\nvenerable than his aged, withered, and somewhat melancholy countenance,\r\nshaded by long white locks, which fell on the collar of his black\r\ncassock, which was pieced in more places than one; the abbe liked\r\nbetter, as they said, to clothe one or two poor children in good warm\r\nbroadcloth, than _faire le muguet_; that is, to wear his cassocks less\r\nthan two or three years. The good abbe was so old, so very old, that his\r\nhands trembled continually, and when he occasionally lifted them up,\r\nwhen speaking, it might have been supposed that he was giving a\r\nbenediction.\r\n\r\n"M. l\'Abbe," said Rodolph, respectfully, "Madame Georges has undertaken\r\nthe guardianship of this young girl, for whom I also beg your kindness."\r\n\r\n"She is entitled to it, sir, like all who come to us. The mercy of God\r\nis inexhaustible, my dear child, and he has evinced it in not abandoning\r\nyou in most severe trials. I know all." And he took the hand of Marie in\r\nhis own withered and trembling palms. "The generous man who has saved\r\nyou has realised the words of Holy Writ, \'The Lord is near to all those\r\nwho call upon him; he will fulfil the desire of those who fear him; he\r\nwill hear their cries, and he will save them.\' Now deserve his bounty by\r\nyour conduct, and you will always find one ready to encourage and\r\nsustain you in the good path on which you have entered. You will have in\r\nMadame Georges a constant example, in me a careful adviser. The Lord\r\nwill finish his work."\r\n\r\n"And I will pray to him for those who have had compassion on me and have\r\nled me to him, father," said La Goualeuse, throwing herself on her knees\r\nbefore the priest. Her emotion overcame her; her sobs almost choked her.\r\nMadame Georges, Rodolph, and the abbe were all deeply affected.\r\n\r\n"Rise, my dear child," said the cure; "you will soon deserve absolution\r\nfrom those serious faults of which you have rather been the victim than\r\nthe criminal; for, in the words of the prophet, \'The Lord raises up all\r\nthose who are ready to fall, and elevates those who are oppressed.\'"\r\n\r\nMurphy, at this moment, opened the door.\r\n\r\n"M. Rodolph," he said, "the horses are ready."\r\n\r\n"Adieu, father! adieu, Madame Georges! I commend your child to your\r\ncare,--our child, I should say. Farewell, Marie; I will soon come and\r\nsee you again."\r\n\r\nThe venerable pastor, leaning on the arms of Madame Georges and La\r\nGoualeuse, who supported his tottering steps, left the room to see\r\nRodolph depart.\r\n\r\nThe last rays of the sun shed their light on this interesting yet sad\r\ngroup:\r\n\r\nAn old priest, the symbol of charity, pardon, and everlasting hope; a\r\nfemale, overwhelmed by every grief that can distress a wife and mother;\r\na young girl, hardly out of her infancy, and but recently thrown into an\r\nabyss of vice through misery and the close contact with crime.\r\n\r\nRodolph got into the carriage, Murphy took his place by his side, and\r\nthe horses set off at speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE RENDEZVOUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day after he had confided the Goualeuse to the care of Madame\r\nGeorges, Rodolph, still dressed as a mechanic, was, at noon precisely,\r\nat the door of a cabaret with the sign of the Panier-Fleuri, not far\r\nfrom the barrier of Bercy.\r\n\r\nThe evening before, at ten o\'clock, the Chourineur was punctual to the\r\nappointment which Rodolph had fixed with him. The result of this\r\nnarrative will inform our readers of the particulars of the meeting. It\r\nwas twelve o\'clock, and the rain fell in torrents; the Seine, swollen by\r\nperpetual falls of rain, had risen very high, and overflowed a part of\r\nthe quay. Rodolph looked from time to time, with a gesture of\r\nimpatience, towards the barrier, and at last observed a man and woman,\r\nwho were coming towards him under the shelter of an umbrella, and whom\r\nhe recognised as the Chouette and the Schoolmaster.\r\n\r\nThese two individuals were completely metamorphosed. The ruffian had\r\nlaid aside his ragged garments and his air of brutal ferocity. He wore a\r\nlong frock coat of green cloth, and a round hat; whilst his shirt and\r\ncravat were remarkable for their whiteness. But for the hideousness of\r\nhis features and the fierce glance of his eyes, always restless and\r\nsuspicious, this fellow might have been taken, by his quiet and steady\r\nstep, for an honest citizen.\r\n\r\nThe Chouette was also in her Sunday costume, wearing a large shawl of\r\nfine wool, with a large pattern, and held in her hand a capacious\r\nbasket.\r\n\r\nThe rain having ceased for the moment, Rodolph, overcoming a sensation\r\nof disgust, went to meet the frightful pair. For the slang of the\r\n_tapis-franc_ the Schoolmaster now substituted a style almost polished,\r\nand which betokened a cultivated mind, in strange contrast with his real\r\ncharacter and crimes. When Rodolph approached, the brigand made him a\r\npolite bow, and the Chouette curtseyed respectfully.\r\n\r\n"Sir, your humble servant," said the Schoolmaster. "I am delighted to\r\npay my respects to you--delighted--or, rather, to renew our\r\nacquaintance; for the night before last you paid me two blows of the\r\nfist which were enough to have felled a rhinoceros. But not a word of\r\nthat now; it was a joke on your part, I am sure,--merely done in jest.\r\nLet us not say another word about it, for serious business brings us now\r\ntogether. I saw the Chourineur yesterday, about eleven o\'clock, at the\r\n_tapis-franc_, and appointed to meet him here to-day, in case he chose\r\nto join us,--to be our fellow labourer; but it seems that he most\r\ndecidedly refuses."\r\n\r\n"You, then, accept the proposal?"\r\n\r\n"Your name, sir, if you be so good?"\r\n\r\n"Rodolph."\r\n\r\n"M. Rodolph, we will go into the Panier-Fleuri,--neither myself nor\r\nmadame has breakfasted,--and we will talk over our little matters whilst\r\nwe are taking a crust."\r\n\r\n"Most willingly."\r\n\r\n"We can talk as we go on. You and the Chourineur certainly do owe some\r\nsatisfaction to my wife and myself,--you have caused us to lose more\r\nthan two thousand francs. Chouette had a meeting near St. Ouen with the\r\ntall gentleman in mourning, who came to ask for you at the\r\n_tapis-franc_. He offered us two thousand francs to do something to you.\r\nThe Chourineur has told me all about this. But, Finette," said the\r\nfellow, "go and select a room at the Panier-Fleuri, and order\r\nbreakfast,--some cutlets, a piece of veal, a salad, and a couple of\r\nbottles of vin de beaune, the best quality,--and we will join you\r\nthere."\r\n\r\nThe Chouette, who had not taken her eye off Rodolph for a moment, went\r\noff after exchanging looks with the Schoolmaster, who then said:\r\n\r\n"I say, M. Rodolph, that the Chourineur has edified me on the subject of\r\nthe two thousand francs."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by edified you?"\r\n\r\n"You are right,--the language is a little too refined for you. I would\r\nsay that the Chourineur nearly told me all that the tall gentleman in\r\nmourning, with his two thousand francs, required."\r\n\r\n"Good."\r\n\r\n"Not so good, young man; for the Chourineur, having yesterday morning\r\nmet the Chouette, near St. Ouen, did not leave her for one moment, when\r\nthe tall gentleman in mourning came up, so that he could not approach\r\nand converse with her. You, then, ought to put us in the way of\r\nregaining our two thousand francs."\r\n\r\n"Nothing easier; but let us \'hark back.\' I had proposed a glorious job\r\nto the Chourineur, which he at first accepted, but afterwards refused to\r\ngo on with."\r\n\r\n"He always had very peculiar ideas."\r\n\r\n"But whilst he refused he observed to me--"\r\n\r\n"He made you observe--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, _diable_! You are very grand with your grammar."\r\n\r\n"It is my profession, as a schoolmaster."\r\n\r\n"He made me, then, observe, that if he would not go on this \'lay,\' he\r\ndid not desire to discourage any other person, and that you would\r\nwillingly lend a hand in the affair."\r\n\r\n"May I, without impertinence, ask why you appointed a meeting with the\r\nChourineur at St. Ouen yesterday, which gave him the advantage of\r\nmeeting the Chouette? He was too much puzzled at my question to give me\r\na clear answer."\r\n\r\nRodolph bit his lips imperceptibly, and replied, shrugging his\r\nshoulders:\r\n\r\n"Very likely; for I only told him half my plan, you must know, not\r\nknowing if he had made up his mind."\r\n\r\n"That was very proper."\r\n\r\n"The more so as I had two strings to my bow."\r\n\r\n"You are a careful man. You met the Chourineur, then, at St. Ouen,\r\nfor--"\r\n\r\nRodolph, after a moment\'s hesitation, had the good luck to think of a\r\nstory which would account for the want of address which the Chourineur\r\nhad displayed, and said:\r\n\r\n"Why, this it is. The attempt I propose is a famous one, because the\r\nperson in question is in the country; all my fear was that he should\r\nreturn to Paris. To make sure, I went to Pierrefitte, where his\r\ncountry-house is situated, and there I learned that he would not be back\r\nagain until the day after to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Well, but to return to my question; why did you appoint to meet the\r\nChourineur at St. Ouen?"\r\n\r\n"Why, you are not so bright as I took you for. How far is it from\r\nPierrefitte to St. Ouen?"\r\n\r\n"About a league."\r\n\r\n"And from St. Ouen to Paris?"\r\n\r\n"As much."\r\n\r\n"Well, if I had not found any one at Pierrefitte,--that is, if there had\r\nbeen an empty house there,--why, there also would have been a good job;\r\nnot so good as in Paris, but still well worth having. I went back to the\r\nChourineur, who was waiting for me at St. Ouen. We should have returned\r\nthen to Pierrefitte, by a cross-path which I know, and--"\r\n\r\n"I understand. If, on the contrary, the job was to be done in Paris?"\r\n\r\n"We should have gained the Barrier de l\'Etoile by the road of the\r\nRivolte, and thence to the Allee des Veuves--"\r\n\r\n"Is but a step; that is plain enough. At St. Ouen you were well placed\r\nfor either operation,--that was clear; and now I can understand why the\r\nChourineur was at St. Ouen. So the house in the Allee des Veuves will be\r\nuninhabited until the day after to-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"Uninhabited, except the porter."\r\n\r\n"I see. And is it a profitable job?"\r\n\r\n"Sixty thousand francs in gold in the proprietor\'s cabinet."\r\n\r\n"And you know all the ways?"\r\n\r\n"Perfectly."\r\n\r\n"Silence, here we are; not a word before the vulgar. I do not know if\r\nyou feel as I do, but the morning air has given me an appetite."\r\n\r\nThe Chouette was awaiting them at the door.\r\n\r\n"This way; this way," she said. "I have ordered our breakfast."\r\n\r\nRodolph wished the brigand to pass in first, for certain reasons; but\r\nthe Schoolmaster insisted on showing so much politeness, that Rodolph\r\nentered before him. Before he sat down, the Schoolmaster tapped lightly\r\nagainst each of the divisions of the wainscot, that he might ascertain\r\ntheir thickness and power of transmitting sounds.\r\n\r\n"We need not be afraid to speak out," said he; "the division is not\r\nthin. We shall have our breakfast soon, and shall not be disturbed in\r\nour conversation."\r\n\r\nA waiter brought in the breakfast, and before he shut the door Rodolph\r\nsaw the charcoal-man, Murphy, seated with great composure at a table in\r\na room close at hand.\r\n\r\nThe room in which the scene took place that we are describing was long\r\nand narrow, lighted by one window, which looked into the street, and was\r\nopposite to the door. The Chouette turned her back to this window,\r\nwhilst the Schoolmaster was at one side of the table, and Rodolph on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nWhen the servant left the room, the brigand got up, took his plate, and\r\nseated himself beside Rodolph and between him and the door.\r\n\r\n"We can talk better," he said, "and need not talk so loud."\r\n\r\n"And then you can prevent me from going out," replied Rodolph, calmly.\r\n\r\nThe Schoolmaster gave a nod in the affirmative, and then, half drawing\r\nout of the pocket of his frock coat a stiletto, round and as thick as a\r\ngoose\'s quill, with a handle of wood which disappeared in the grasp of\r\nhis hairy fingers, said:\r\n\r\n"You see that?"\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"Advice to amateurs!" And bringing his shaggy brows together, by a frown\r\nwhich made his wide and flat forehead closely resemble a tiger\'s, he\r\nmade a significant gesture.\r\n\r\n"And you may believe me," added the Chouette, "I have made the tool\r\nsharp."\r\n\r\nRodolph, with perfect coolness, put his hand under his blouse, and took\r\nout a double-barrelled pistol, which he showed to the Schoolmaster, and\r\nthen put into his pocket.\r\n\r\n"All right; and now we understand each other; but do not misunderstand\r\nme, I am only alluding to an impossibility. If they try to arrest me,\r\nand you have laid any trap for me, I will make \'cold meat\' of you."\r\n\r\nAnd he gave a fierce look at Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"And I will spring upon him and help you, _fourline_," cried the\r\nChouette.\r\n\r\nRodolph made no reply, but shrugged his shoulders, and, pouring out a\r\nglass of wine, tossed it off. His coolness deceived the Schoolmaster.\r\n\r\n"I only put you on your guard."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, put up your \'larding-pin\' into your pocket; you have no\r\nchicken to lard now. I am an old cock, and know my game as well as\r\nmost," said Rodolph. "But, to our business."\r\n\r\n"Yes, let us talk of business; but do not speak against my\r\n\'larding-pin;\' it makes no noise, and does not disturb anybody."\r\n\r\n"And does its work as should be; doesn\'t it, _fourline_?" added the old\r\nbeldam.\r\n\r\n"By the way," said Rodolph to the Chouette, "do you really know the\r\nGoualeuse\'s parents?"\r\n\r\n"My man has in his pocket two letters about it, but she shall never see\r\nthem,--the little slut! I would rather tear her eyes out with my own\r\nhands. Oh, when I meet her again at the _tapis-franc_, won\'t I pay her\r\noff--"\r\n\r\n"There, that\'ll do, Finette; we have other things to talk of, and so\r\nleave off your gossip."\r\n\r\n"May we \'patter\' before the \'mot?\'" asked Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"Most decidedly! She\'s true as steel, and is worth her weight in gold to\r\nwatch for us, to get information or impressions of keys, to conceal\r\nstolen goods or sell them,--nothing comes amiss to her. She is a\r\nfirst-rate manager. Good Finette!" added the robber, extending his hand\r\nto the horrid hag. "You can have no idea of the services she has done\r\nme. Take off your shawl, Finette, or you\'ll be cold when you go out; put\r\nit on the chair with your basket."\r\n\r\nThe Chouette took off her shawl.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his presence of mind, and the command which he had over\r\nhimself, Rodolph could not quite conceal his surprise when he saw\r\nsuspended by a ring of silver, from a thick chain of metal which hung\r\nround the old creature\'s neck, a small Saint Esprit in lapis lazuli,\r\nprecisely resembling that which the son of Madame Georges had round his\r\nneck when he was carried off.\r\n\r\nAt this discovery, a sudden idea flashed across the mind of Rodolph.\r\nAccording to the Chourineur\'s statement, the Schoolmaster had escaped\r\nfrom the Bagne six months ago, and had since defied all search after him\r\nby disfiguring himself as he had now; and six months ago the husband of\r\nMadame Georges had disappeared from the Bagne. Rodolph surmised that,\r\nvery possibly, the Schoolmaster was the husband of that unhappy lady. If\r\nthis were so, he knew the fate of the son she lamented,--he possessed,\r\ntoo, some papers relative to the birth of the Goualeuse. Rodolph had,\r\nthen, fresh motives for persevering in his projects, and, fortunately,\r\nhis absence of mind was not observed by the Schoolmaster, who was busy\r\nhelping the Chouette.\r\n\r\n"_Morbleu!_ What a pretty chain you have!" said Rodolph to the one-eyed\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n"Pretty, and not dear," answered the old creature, laughing. "It is only\r\na sham till my man can afford to give me a real one."\r\n\r\n"That will depend on this gentleman, Finette. If our job comes off well,\r\nwhy then--"\r\n\r\n"It is astonishing how well it is imitated," continued Rodolph. "And\r\nwhat is that little blue thing at the end?"\r\n\r\n"It is a present from my man, which I shall wear until he gives me a\r\n\'ticker.\' Isn\'t it, _fourline_?"\r\n\r\nRodolph\'s suspicions were thus half confirmed, and he waited with\r\nanxiety for the reply of the Schoolmaster, who said:\r\n\r\n"You must take care of that, notwithstanding the \'ticker,\' Finette; it\r\nis a talisman, and brings good luck."\r\n\r\n"A talisman!" said Rodolph, in a careless tone; "do you believe in\r\ntalismans? And where the devil did you pick it up? Give me the address\r\nof the shop."\r\n\r\n"They do not make them now; the shop is shut up. As you see it, that bit\r\nof jewelry has a very great antiquity,--three generations. I value it\r\nhighly, for it is a family loom," added he, with a hideous grin; "and\r\nthat\'s why I gave it to Finette, that she might have good fortune in the\r\nenterprises in which she so skilfully seconds me. Only see her at work!\r\nonly see her! If we go into \'business\' together, why--But let us now to\r\nour affair in hand. You say that in the Allee des Veuves--"\r\n\r\n"At No. 17 there is a house inhabited by a rich man, whose name is--"\r\n\r\n"I will not be guilty of the indiscretion of asking his name. You say\r\nthere are sixty thousand francs in gold in a cabinet?"\r\n\r\n"Sixty thousand francs in gold!" exclaimed the Chouette.\r\n\r\nRodolph nodded his head in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n"And you know this house, and the people in it?" said the Schoolmaster.\r\n\r\n"Quite well."\r\n\r\n"Is the entry difficult?"\r\n\r\n"A wall seven feet high on the side of the Allee des Veuves, a garden,\r\nwindows down to the ground, and the house has only the ground floor\r\nthroughout."\r\n\r\n"And there is only the porter to guard this treasure?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And what, young man, is your proposed plan of proceeding?"\r\n\r\n"Simple enough: to climb over the wall, pick the lock of the door, or\r\nforce open a shutter or lock. What do you think of it?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot answer you before I have examined it all myself,--that is, by\r\nthe aid of my wife; but, if all you tell me is as you say, I think it\r\nwould be the thing to do it at once this evening."\r\n\r\nAnd the ruffian looked earnestly at Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"This evening!--impossible!" replied he.\r\n\r\n"Why, since the occupier does not return until the day after\r\nto-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I--I cannot this evening--"\r\n\r\n"Really? Well, and I--I cannot to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"For the reason that prevents you this evening," said the robber, in a\r\ntone of mockery.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\'s reflection, Rodolph replied:\r\n\r\n"Well, then, this evening be it. Where shall we meet?"\r\n\r\n"We will not separate," said the Schoolmaster.\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"Why should we?"\r\n\r\n"What is the use of separating? The weather has cleared up, and we will\r\ngo and walk about, and give a look at the Allee des Veuves; you will see\r\nhow my woman will work. When that is done, we will return and play a\r\nhand at piquet, and have a bit of something in a place in the Champs\r\nElysees that I know, near the river; and, as the Allee des Veuves is\r\ndeserted at an early hour, we will walk that way about ten o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"I will join you at nine o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"Do you or do you not wish that we should do this job together?"\r\n\r\n"I do wish it."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, we do not separate before evening, or else--"\r\n\r\n"Or else?"\r\n\r\n"I shall think that you are making \'a plant\' for me, and that\'s the\r\nreason you wish to part company now."\r\n\r\n"If I wished to set the \'traps\' after you, what is to prevent my doing\r\nso this evening?"\r\n\r\n"Why, everything. You did not expect that I should propose the affair to\r\nyou so soon, and if you do not leave us you cannot put anybody up to\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"You mistrust me, then?"\r\n\r\n"Most extremely. But as what you propose may be quite true and honest,\r\nand the half of sixty thousand francs is worth a risk, I am willing to\r\ntry for it; but this evening, or never; if never, I shall have my\r\nsuspicions of you confirmed, and one day or other I will take care and\r\nlet you dine off a dish of my cooking."\r\n\r\n"And I will return your compliment, rely on it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, this is all stuff and nonsense!" said the Chouette. "I think with\r\n_fourline_, to-night or never."\r\n\r\nRodolph was in a state of extreme anxiety; if he allowed this\r\nopportunity to escape of laying hands on the Schoolmaster, he might\r\nnever again light on him. The ruffian would ever afterwards be on his\r\nguard, or if recognised, apprehended, and taken back to the Bagne, would\r\ncarry with him that secret which Rodolph had so much interest in\r\ndiscovering. Confiding in his address and courage, and trusting to\r\nchance, he said to the Schoolmaster:\r\n\r\n"Agreed, then; and we will not part company before evening."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'m your man. It is now two o\'clock; it is some distance from here\r\nto the Allee des Veuves; it is raining again in torrents; let us pay the\r\nreckoning and take a coach."\r\n\r\n"If we have a coach, I should like first to smoke a cigar."\r\n\r\n"Why not?" said the Schoolmaster. "Finette does not mind the smell of\r\ntobacco."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I\'ll go and fetch some cigars," said Rodolph, rising.\r\n\r\n"Pray don\'t give yourself that trouble," said the Schoolmaster, stopping\r\nhim; "Finette will go."\r\n\r\nRodolph resumed his seat. The Schoolmaster had penetrated his design.\r\nThe Chouette went out.\r\n\r\n"What a clever manager I have, haven\'t I?" said the ruffian; "and so\r\ntractable, she would throw herself into the fire for me."\r\n\r\n"Apropos of fire, it is not overwarm here," replied Rodolph, placing\r\nboth his hands under his blouse; and then, continuing his conversation\r\nwith the Schoolmaster, he took out a lead-pencil and a morsel of paper,\r\nwhich he had in his waistcoat pocket, without being detected, and wrote\r\nsome words hastily, taking care to make his letters wide apart, so that\r\nthey might be more legible; for he wrote under his blouse, and without\r\nseeing what he wrote.\r\n\r\nThis note escaped the penetration of the Schoolmaster; the next thing\r\nwas to enable it to reach its address.\r\n\r\nRodolph rose and went listlessly towards the window, and began to hum a\r\ntune between his teeth, accompanying himself on the window glasses.\r\n\r\nThe Schoolmaster came up to the window and said to Rodolph:\r\n\r\n"What tune are you playing?"\r\n\r\n"I am playing \'_Tu n\'auras pas ma rose._\'"\r\n\r\n"And a very pretty tune it is. I should like to know if it would have\r\nthe effect of making any of the passers-by turn round?"\r\n\r\n"I had no such intention."\r\n\r\n"You are wrong, young man; for you are playing the tambourine on that\r\npane of glass with all your might. But I was thinking, the porter of\r\nthis house in the Allee des Veuves is perhaps a stout fellow; if he\r\nresists, you have only your pistol, which is a noisy weapon, whilst a\r\ntool like this (and he showed Rodolph the handle of his poniard) makes\r\nno noise, and does not disturb anybody."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean, then, to assassinate him?" exclaimed Rodolph. "If you have\r\nany such intention, let us give up the job altogether; I will have no\r\nhand in it,--so don\'t rely on me--"\r\n\r\n"But if he wakes?"\r\n\r\n"We will take to our heels."\r\n\r\n"Well, just as you like; only it is better to come to a clear\r\nunderstanding beforehand. So, then, ours is simply a mere robbery with\r\nforcible entry--"\r\n\r\n"Nothing more."\r\n\r\n"That\'s very silly and contemptible; but so be it."\r\n\r\n"And as I will not leave you for a second," thought Rodolph, "I will\r\nprevent you from shedding blood."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chouette returned to the room, bringing the cigars with her.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it rains now," said Rodolph, lighting his cigar. "Suppose\r\nwe go and fetch the coach ourselves,--it will stretch our legs."\r\n\r\n"What! not rain!" replied the Schoolmaster; "are you blind? Do you think\r\nI will expose Finette to the chance of catching cold, and exposing her\r\nprecious life, and spoiling her new shawl?"\r\n\r\n"You are right, old fellow; it rains cats and dogs. Let the servant come\r\nand we can pay him, and desire him to fetch us a coach," replied\r\nRodolph.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the most sensible thing you have said yet, young fellow; we may\r\ngo and look about as we seek the Allee des Veuves."\r\n\r\nThe servant entered, and Rodolph gave her five francs.\r\n\r\n"Ah, sir, it is really an imposition,--I cannot allow it," exclaimed the\r\nSchoolmaster.\r\n\r\n"Oh, all right; your turn next time."\r\n\r\n"Be it so, but on condition that I shall offer you something, by and by,\r\nin a little cabaret in the Champs Elysees,--a capital little snuggery\r\nthat I know of."\r\n\r\n"Just as you like."\r\n\r\nThe servant paid, and they left the room.\r\n\r\nRodolph wished to go last, out of politeness to the Chouette, but the\r\nSchoolmaster would not allow it, and followed close on his heels,\r\nwatching his every movement.\r\n\r\nThe master of the house kept a wine-shop also, and amongst other\r\ndrinkers, a charcoal-man, with his face blackened and his large hat\r\nflapping over his eyes, was paying his "shot" at the bar when these\r\nthree personages appeared. In spite of the close lookout of the\r\nSchoolmaster and the one-eyed hag, Rodolph, who walked before the\r\nhideous pair, exchanged a rapid and unperceived glance with Murphy as he\r\ngot into the hackney-coach.\r\n\r\n"Which way am I to go, master?" asked the driver.\r\n\r\nRodolph replied, in a loud voice:\r\n\r\n"Allee des--"\r\n\r\n"Des Acacias, in the Bois de Boulogne," cried the Schoolmaster,\r\ninterrupting him. Then he added, "And we will pay you well, coachman."\r\n\r\nThe door was shut.\r\n\r\n"What the devil made you bawl out which way we were going before these\r\npeople?" said the Schoolmaster. "If the thing were found out to-morrow,\r\nwe might be traced and discovered. Young man,--young man, you are very\r\nimprudent!"\r\n\r\nThe coach was already in motion. Rodolph answered:\r\n\r\n"True; I did not think of that. But with my cigar I shall smoke you like\r\nherrings; let us have a window open."\r\n\r\nAnd, joining the action to the words, Rodolph, with much dexterity, let\r\nfall outside the window the morsel of paper, folded very small, on which\r\nhe had hastily written a few words in pencil under his blouse. The\r\nSchoolmaster\'s glance was so quick, that, in spite of the calmness of\r\nRodolph\'s features, the ruffian detected some expression of triumph,\r\nfor, putting his head out of the window, he called out to the driver:\r\n\r\n"Whip behind! whip behind! there is some one getting up at the back of\r\nthe coach!"\r\n\r\nThe coach stopped, and the driver, standing on his seat, looked back,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n"No, master, there is no one there."\r\n\r\n"_Parbleu!_ I will look myself," replied the Schoolmaster, jumping out\r\ninto the street.\r\n\r\nNot seeing any person or anything (for since Rodolph had dropped the\r\npaper the coach had gone on several yards), the Schoolmaster thought he\r\nwas mistaken.\r\n\r\n"You will laugh at me," he said, as he resumed his seat, "but I don\'t\r\nknow why I thought some one was following us."\r\n\r\nThe coach at this moment turned round a corner, and Murphy, who had not\r\nlost sight of it with his eyes, and had seen Rodolph\'s manoeuvre, ran\r\nand picked up the little note, which had fallen into a crevice between\r\ntwo of the paving-stones.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a quarter of an hour the Schoolmaster said to the driver\r\nof the hackney-coach:\r\n\r\n"My man, we have changed our minds; drive to the Place de la Madelaine."\r\n\r\nRodolph looked at him with astonishment.\r\n\r\n"All right, young man; from hence we may go to a thousand different\r\nplaces. If they seek to track us hereafter, the deposition of the\r\ncoachman will not be of the slightest service to them."\r\n\r\nAt the moment when the coach was approaching the barrier, a tall man,\r\nclothed in a long white riding-coat, with his hat drawn over his eyes,\r\nand whose complexion appeared of a deep brown, passed rapidly along the\r\nroad, stooping over the neck of a high, splendid hunter, which trotted\r\nwith extraordinary speed.\r\n\r\n"A good horse and a good rider," said Rodolph, leaning forward to the\r\ndoor of the coach and following Murphy (for it was he) with his eyes.\r\n"What a pace that stout man goes! Did you see him?"\r\n\r\n"_Ma foi!_ he passed so very quickly," said the Schoolmaster, "that I\r\ndid not remark him."\r\n\r\nRodolph calmly concealed his satisfaction; Murphy had, doubtless,\r\ndeciphered the almost hieroglyphic characters of the note which he had\r\ndropped, and which had escaped the vigilance of the Schoolmaster.\r\nCertain that the coach was not followed, he had become more assured, and\r\ndesirous of imitating the Chouette, who slept, or rather pretended to\r\nsleep, he said to Rodolph:\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, young man, but the motion of the coach always produces a\r\nsingular effect on me,--it sends me off to sleep like a child."\r\n\r\nThe ruffian, under the guise of assumed sleep, thought to examine\r\nwhether the physiognomy of his companion betrayed any emotion; but\r\nRodolph was on his guard, and replied:\r\n\r\n"I rose so early that I feel sleepy, and will have a nap, too."\r\n\r\nHe shut his eyes, and very soon the hard breathing of the Schoolmaster\r\nand the Chouette, who snored in chorus, so completely deceived Rodolph,\r\nthat, thinking his companions sound asleep, he half opened his eyes. The\r\nSchoolmaster and the Chouette, in spite of their loud snoring, had their\r\neyes open, and were exchanging some mysterious signs by means of their\r\nfingers curiously placed or bent in the palms of their hands. In an\r\ninstant this mute language ceased. The brigand no doubt perceived, by\r\nsome almost imperceptible sign, that Rodolph was not asleep, and said,\r\nin a laughing tone:\r\n\r\n"Ah, ah, comrade! what, you were trying your friends, were you?"\r\n\r\n"That can\'t astonish you, who sleep with your eyes open."\r\n\r\n"I, who--That\'s different, young man; I am a somnambulist."\r\n\r\nThe hackney-coach stopped in the Place de la Madelaine. The rain had\r\nceased for a moment, but the clouds, driven by the violence of the wind,\r\nwere so dark and so low, that it was almost night in appearance.\r\nRodolph, the Chouette, and the Schoolmaster went towards the Cours la\r\nReine.\r\n\r\n"Young man, I have an idea, which is not a bad one," said the robber.\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"To ascertain if all that you have told us respecting the interior of\r\nthe house in the Allee des Veuves is true."\r\n\r\n"You surely will not go there now, under any circumstances? It would\r\nawaken suspicion."\r\n\r\n"I am not such a flat as that, young fellow; but why have I a wife whose\r\nname is Finette?"\r\n\r\nThe Chouette drew up her head.\r\n\r\n"Do you see her, young man? Why, she looks like a war-horse when he\r\nhears the blast of the trumpet!"\r\n\r\n"You mean to send her as a lookout?"\r\n\r\n"Precisely so."\r\n\r\n"No. 17, Allee des Veuves, isn\'t it, my man?" cried the Chouette,\r\nimpatiently. "Make yourself easy: I have but one eye, but that is a good\r\none."\r\n\r\n"Do you see, young man,--do you see she is all impatience to be at\r\nwork?"\r\n\r\n"If she manages cleverly to get into the house, I do not think your idea\r\na bad one."\r\n\r\n"Take the umbrella, _fourline_; in half an hour I will be here again,\r\nand you shall see what I will do," said the Chouette.\r\n\r\n"One moment, Finette; we are going down to the Bleeding Heart,--only two\r\nsteps from here. If the little Tortillard (cripple) is there, you had\r\nbetter take him with you; he will remain outside on the watch whilst you\r\ngo inside the house."\r\n\r\n"You are right,--little Tortillard is as cunning as a fox; he is not ten\r\nyears of age, and yet it was he who the other day--"\r\n\r\nA signal from the Schoolmaster interrupted the Chouette.\r\n\r\n"What does the \'Bleeding Heart\' mean? It is an odd sign for a cabaret,"\r\nasked Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"You must complain to the landlord."\r\n\r\n"What is his name?"\r\n\r\n"The landlord of the Bleeding Heart?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"What is that to you? He never asks the names of his customers."\r\n\r\n"But, still--"\r\n\r\n"Call him what you like,--Peter, Thomas, Christopher, or Barnabas,--he\r\nwill answer to any and all. But here we are, and it\'s time we were, for\r\nthe rain is coming down again in floods; and how the river roars! It has\r\nalmost become a torrent! Why, look at it! Two more days of such rain,\r\nand the water will overflow the arches of the bridge."\r\n\r\n"You say that we are _there_, but where the devil is the cabaret? I do\r\nnot see any house here."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not, if you look round about you."\r\n\r\n"Where should I look, then?"\r\n\r\n"At your feet."\r\n\r\n"At my feet?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And whereabouts?"\r\n\r\n"Here,--look; do you see the roof? Mind, and don\'t step upon it."\r\n\r\nRodolph had not remarked one of those subterraneans which used to be\r\nseen, some years since, in certain spots in the Champs Elysees, and\r\nparticularly near the Cours la Reine.\r\n\r\nA flight of steps, cut out of the damp and greasy ground, led to the\r\nbottom of this sort of deep ditch, against one end of which, cut\r\nperpendicularly, leaned a low, mean, dilapidated hovel; its roof,\r\ncovered with moss-covered tiles, was scarcely so high as the ground on\r\nwhich Rodolph was standing; two or three out-buildings, constructed of\r\nworm-eaten planks, serving as cellar, wood-house, and rabbit-hutches,\r\nsurrounded this wretched den.\r\n\r\nA narrow path, which extended along this ditch, led from the stairs to\r\nthe door of the hut; the rest of the ground was concealed under a mass\r\nof trellis-work, which sheltered two rows of clumsy tables, fastened to\r\nthe ground. A worn-out iron sign swung heavily backwards and forwards on\r\nits creaking hinges, and through the rust that covered it might still be\r\nseen a red heart pierced with an arrow. The sign was supported by a post\r\nerected above this cave,--this real human burrow.\r\n\r\nA thick and moist fog was added to the rain as night approached.\r\n\r\n"What think you of this hotel, young fellow?" inquired the Schoolmaster.\r\n\r\n"Why, thanks to the torrents that have fallen for the last fortnight, it\r\nmust be deliciously fresh. But come on."\r\n\r\n"One moment,--I wish to know if the landlord is in. Hark!"\r\n\r\nThe ruffian then, thrusting his tongue forcibly against his palate,\r\nproduced a singular noise,--a sort of guttural sound, loud and\r\nlengthened, something like P-r-r-r-r-r-r-r!!! A similar note came from\r\nthe depths of the hovel.\r\n\r\n"He\'s there," said the Schoolmaster. "Pardon me, young man,--respect to\r\nthe ladies,--allow the Chouette to pass first; I follow you. Mind how\r\nyou come,--it\'s slippery."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE BLEEDING HEART.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe landlord of the Bleeding Heart, after having responded to the signal\r\nof the Schoolmaster, advanced politely to the threshold of his door.\r\n\r\nThis personage, whom Rodolph had been to see in the Cite, and whom he\r\ndid not yet know under his true name, or, rather, his habitual surname,\r\nwas Bras Rouge.\r\n\r\nLank, mean-looking, and feeble, this man might be fifty years of age.\r\nHis countenance resembled both the weasel and the rat; his peaked nose,\r\nhis receding chin, his high cheek-bones, his small eyes, black,\r\nrestless, and keen, gave his features an indescribable expression of\r\nmalice, cunning, and sagacity. An old brown wig, or, rather, as yellow\r\nas his bilious complexion, perched on the top of his head, showed the\r\nnape of the old fellow\'s withered neck. He had on a round jacket, and\r\none of those long black aprons worn by the waiters at the wine shops.\r\n\r\nOur three acquaintances had hardly descended the last step of the\r\nstaircase when a child of about ten years of age, rickety, lame, and\r\nsomewhat misshapen, came to rejoin Bras Rouge, whom he resembled in so\r\nstriking a manner that there was no mistaking them for father and son.\r\nThere was the same quick and cunning look, joined to that impudent,\r\nhardened, and knavish air, which is peculiar to the scamp (_voyou_) of\r\nParis,--that fearful type of precocious depravity, that real \'hemp-seed\'\r\n(_graine de bagne_), as they style it, in the horrible slang of the\r\ngaol. The forehead of the brat was half lost beneath a thatch of\r\nyellowish locks, as harsh and stiff as horse-hair. Reddish-coloured\r\ntrousers and a gray blouse, confined by a leather girdle, completed\r\nTortillard\'s costume, whose nickname was derived from his infirmity. He\r\nstood close to his father, standing on his sound leg like a heron by the\r\nside of a marsh.\r\n\r\n"Ah, here is the darling one (_mome_)!" said the Schoolmaster. "Finette,\r\nnight is coming on, and time is pressing; we must profit by the daylight\r\nwhich is left to us."\r\n\r\n"You are right, my man; I will ask the father to spare his darling."\r\n\r\n"Good day, old friend," said Bras Rouge, addressing the Schoolmaster, in\r\na voice which was cracked, sharp, and shrill. "What can I do for you?"\r\n\r\n"Why, if you could spare your \'small boy\' to my mistress for a quarter\r\nof an hour, she has lost something which he could help her to look for."\r\n\r\nBras Rouge winked his eye and made a sign to the Schoolmaster, and then\r\nsaid to the child:\r\n\r\n"Tortillard, go with madame."\r\n\r\nThe hideous brat hopped forward and took hold of the "one-eyed\'s" hand.\r\n\r\n"Love of a bright boy, come along! There is a child!" said Finette. "And\r\nhow like his father! He is not like Pegriotte, who always pretended to\r\nhave a pain in her side when she came near me,--a little baggage!"\r\n\r\n"Come, come away!--be off, Finette! Keep your weather-eye open, and\r\nbright lookout. I await you here."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t be long. Go first, Tortillard."\r\n\r\nThe one-eyed hag and the little cripple went up the slippery steps.\r\n\r\n"Finette, take the umbrella," the brigand called out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'_Ah, Here is the \'Darling One\'!_\'"\r\nOriginal Etching by Adrian Marcel]\r\n\r\n"It would be in the way, my man," said the old woman, who quickly\r\ndisappeared with Tortillard in the midst of the fog, which thickened\r\nwith the twilight, and the hollow murmur of the wind as it moaned\r\nthrough the thick and leafless branches of the tall elms in the Champs\r\nElysees.\r\n\r\n"Let us go in," said Rodolph.\r\n\r\nIt was requisite to stoop in passing in at the door of the cabaret,\r\nwhich was divided into two apartments. In one was a bar and a\r\nbroken-down billiard-table; in the other, tables and garden chairs,\r\nwhich had once been painted green. Two narrow windows, with their\r\ncracked panes festooned with spiders\' webs, cast a dim but not religious\r\nlight on the damp walls.\r\n\r\nRodolph was alone for one moment only, during which Bras Rouge and the\r\nSchoolmaster had time to exchange some words, rapidly uttered, and some\r\nmysterious signs.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll take a glass of beer,--or brandy, perhaps,--whilst we wait for\r\nFinette?" said the Schoolmaster.\r\n\r\n"No; I am not thirsty."\r\n\r\n"Do as you like,--I am for a \'drain\' of brandy," said the ruffian; and\r\nhe seated himself on one of the little green tables in the second\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nDarkness came on to this den so completely, that it was impossible to\r\nsee in one of the angles of this inner apartment the open mouth of one\r\nof those cellars which are entered by a door in two divisions, one of\r\nwhich was constantly kept open for the convenience of access. The table\r\nat which the Schoolmaster sat was close upon this dark and deep hole,\r\nand he turned his back upon it, so that it was entirely concealed from\r\nRodolph\'s view.\r\n\r\nHe was looking through the window, in order to command his countenance\r\nand conceal the workings of his thoughts. The sight of Murphy speeding\r\nthrough the Allee des Veuves did not quite assure him; he was afraid\r\nthat the worthy squire had not quite understood the full meaning of his\r\nnote, necessarily so laconic, and containing only these words:\r\n\r\n"This evening--ten o\'clock. Be on your guard."\r\n\r\nResolved not to go to the Allee des Veuves before that moment, nor to\r\nlose sight of the Schoolmaster for an instant, he yet trembled at the\r\nidea of losing the only opportunity that might ever be afforded him of\r\nobtaining that secret which he was so excessively anxious to possess.\r\nAlthough he was powerful and well armed, yet he had to deal with an\r\nunscrupulous assassin, capable of any and every thing. Not desiring,\r\nhowever, that his thoughts should be detected, he seated himself at the\r\ntable with the Schoolmaster, and, by way of seeming at his ease, called\r\nfor a glass of something. Bras Rouge having exchanged a few words, in a\r\nlow tone, with the brigand, looked at Rodolph with an air in which\r\ncuriosity, distrust, and contempt were mingled.\r\n\r\n"It is my advice, young man," said the Schoolmaster, "that if my wife\r\ninforms us that the persons we wish to see are within, we had better\r\nmake our call about eight o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"That will be two hours too soon," said Rodolph; "and that will spoil\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"Do you think so?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure of it."\r\n\r\n"Bah! amongst friends there should be no ceremony."\r\n\r\n"I know them well, and I tell you that we must not think of going before\r\nten o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"Are you out of your senses, young man?"\r\n\r\n"I give you my opinion, and devil fetch me if I stir from here before\r\nten o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t disturb yourself,--I never close my establishment before\r\nmidnight," said Bras Rouge, in his falsetto voice; "it is the time when\r\nmy best customers drop in; and my neighbours never complain of the noise\r\nwhich is made in my house."\r\n\r\n"I must agree to all you wish, young man," continued the Schoolmaster.\r\n"Be it so, then; we will not set out on our visit until ten o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"Here is the Chouette!" said Bras Rouge, hearing and replying to a\r\nwarning cry similar to that which the Schoolmaster had uttered before he\r\ndescended to the subterraneous abode.\r\n\r\nA minute afterwards the Chouette entered the billiard-room alone.\r\n\r\n"It is all right, my man,--I\'ve done the trick!" cried the one-eyed hag,\r\nas she entered.\r\n\r\nBras Rouge discreetly withdrew, without asking a word about Tortillard,\r\nwhom, perhaps, he did not expect to see return. The beldam sat with her\r\nface towards Rodolph and the brigand.\r\n\r\n"Well?" said the Schoolmaster.\r\n\r\n"The young fellow has told us all true, so far."\r\n\r\n"Ah! you see I was right," exclaimed Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"Let the Chouette tell her tale, young man. Come, tell us all about it,\r\nFinette."\r\n\r\n"I went straight to No. 17, leaving Tortillard on the lookout and\r\nconcealed in a corner. It was still daylight, and I rung at a side door\r\nwhich opens outwards, and here\'s about two inches of space between it\r\nand the sill; nothing else to notice. I rang; the porter opened. Before\r\nI pulled the bell I had put my bonnet in my pocket, that I might look\r\nlike a neighbour. As soon as I saw the porter I pretended to cry\r\nviolently, saying that I had lost a pet parrot, Cocotte,--a little\r\ndarling that I adored. I told him I lived in the Rue Marboeuf, and that\r\nI had pursued Cocotte from garden to garden, and entreated him to allow\r\nme to enter and try and find the bird."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said the Schoolmaster, with an air of proud satisfaction, pointing\r\nto Finette, "what a woman!"\r\n\r\n"Very clever," said Rodolph. "And what then?"\r\n\r\n"The porter allowed me to look for the creature, and I went trotting all\r\naround the garden, calling \'Cocotte! Cocotte!\' and looked about me in\r\nevery direction to scrutinise every thing. Inside the walls," continued\r\nthe horrid old hag, going on with her description of the premises,\r\n"inside the walls, trellis-work all around,--a perfect staircase; at the\r\nleft-hand corner of the wall a fir-tree, just like a ladder,--a lying-in\r\nwoman might descend by it. The house has six windows on the ground\r\nfloor, and has no upper story,--six small windows without any fastening.\r\nThe windows of the ground floor close with shutters, having hooks below\r\nand staples in the upper part: press in the bottom, use your steel\r\nfile--"\r\n\r\n"A push," said the Schoolmaster, "and it is open."\r\n\r\nThe Chouette continued:\r\n\r\n"The entrance has a glass door, two Venetian blinds outside--"\r\n\r\n"Memorandum," said the ruffian.\r\n\r\n"Quite correct; it is as precise as if we saw it," said Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"On the left," resumed the Chouette, "near the courtyard, is a well; the\r\nrope may be useful (for at that particular spot there is no trellis\r\nagainst the wall), in case retreat should be cut off in the direction of\r\nthe door. On entering into the house--"\r\n\r\n"You got inside the house, then? Young man, she got inside the house!"\r\nsaid the Schoolmaster, with pride.\r\n\r\n"To be sure I got in! Not finding Cocotte, I had made so much\r\nlamentation that I pretended I was quite out of breath; I begged the\r\nporter to allow me to sit down on the step of the door, and he very\r\nkindly asked me to step in, offering me a glass of wine and water. \'A\r\nglass of plain water,\' I said; \'plain water only, my good sir.\' Then he\r\nmade me go into the antechamber,--carpeted all over; good\r\nprecaution,--footsteps or broken glass cannot be heard, if we must \'mill\r\nthe glaze\' (break a pane of glass); right and left, doors with sliding\r\nbolts, which open by a gentle push from the top. At the bottom was a\r\nstrong door, locked,--it looked very like a money-chest. I had my wax in\r\nmy basket--"\r\n\r\n"She had her wax, young man! She never goes without her wax!" said the\r\nbrigand.\r\n\r\nThe Chouette proceeded:\r\n\r\n"It was necessary to approach the door which smelled so strongly of the\r\ncash, so I pretended that I was seized with a fit of coughing,--so\r\nviolent, that I was compelled to lean against the wall for support.\r\nHearing me cough, the porter said,\'I\'ll fetch you a morsel of sugar to\r\nput in your water.\' He probably looked for a spoon, for I heard plate\r\nchink,--plate in the room on the left-hand; don\'t forget that,\r\n_fourline_. Well, coughing and wheezing, I reached the door at the\r\nbottom,--I had my wax in the palm of my hand. I leaned against the lock\r\nas though accidentally, and here is the impression; we may not want it\r\nto-day, but another time it may be useful."\r\n\r\nAnd the Chouette gave the brigand a bit of yellow wax, on which the\r\nprint of the lock was perfectly impressed.\r\n\r\n"You can tell us whether this is the door of the money-chest," said the\r\nChouette.\r\n\r\n"It is, and there is the cash," replied Rodolph; and then said to\r\nhimself, "Has Murphy, then, been the dupe of this cursed old hag?\r\nPerhaps so, and he only expects to be assailed at ten o\'clock; by that\r\ntime every precaution will have been taken."\r\n\r\n"But all the money is not there," continued the Chouette, and her one\r\ngreen eye sparkled. "As I approached the windows, still searching for my\r\ndarling Cocotte, I saw in one of the chambers (door on the left) some\r\nbags of crown pieces, in a bureau. I saw them as plainly as I see you,\r\nmy man; there were at least a dozen of them."\r\n\r\n"Where is Tortillard?" said the Schoolmaster.\r\n\r\n"In his hiding-place,--not more than two paces from the garden. He can\r\nsee in the dark like a cat. There is only that one entrance to No. 17,\r\nso when we go he will tell us if any one has come or not."\r\n\r\n"That\'s good--"\r\n\r\nThe Schoolmaster had scarcely uttered these words than he made a sudden\r\nrush at Rodolph, grappled him by the throat, and flung him violently\r\ndown the cellar which was yawning behind the table.\r\n\r\nThe attack was so rapid, unexpected, and powerful, that Rodolph could\r\nneither foresee nor avoid it. The Chouette, alarmed, uttered a piercing\r\nshriek; for at the first moment she had not seen the result of the\r\nstruggle. When the noise of Rodolph\'s body rolling down the steps had\r\nceased, the Schoolmaster, who knew all the ways and windings of the\r\nunderground vaults in the place, went down the stairs slowly, listening\r\nas he went.\r\n\r\n"_Fourline_, be on your guard," cried the beldam, leaning over the\r\nopening of the trap; "draw your \'pinking iron.\'"\r\n\r\nThe brigand disappeared without any reply. For a time nothing was heard,\r\nbut at the end of a few moments the distant noise of a door shutting,\r\nwhich creaked on its rusty hinges, sounded harshly in the depths of the\r\ncavern; then all was again still as death. The darkness was complete.\r\nThe Chouette fumbled in her basket, and then, producing a lucifer-match,\r\nlighted a wax taper, whose feeble ray made visible the darkness of this\r\ndreary den.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the monster-visage of the Schoolmaster appeared at the\r\nopening of the trap. The Chouette could not repress an exclamation of\r\nhorror at the sight of his ghastly, seamed, mutilated, and fearful face,\r\nwith eyes that gleamed like phosphorus, and seemed to glare on the\r\nground even in the midst of the darkness which the lighted taper could\r\nnot entirely dissipate. Having subdued her feeling of fright, the old\r\nhag exclaimed, in a tone of horrible flattery:\r\n\r\n"You must be an awful man, _fourline_, for even I was frightened!--yes,\r\nI!"\r\n\r\n"Quick, quick, for the Allee des Veuves!" said the ruffian, securely\r\nclosing the double flap of the trap with a bar of iron. "In another\r\nhour, perhaps, it will be too late. If it is a trap, it is not yet\r\nbaited; if it is not, why, we can do the job alone."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE VAULT.\r\n\r\n\r\nStunned by his horrible fall, Rodolph lay senseless and motionless at\r\nthe bottom of the stairs, down which he had been hurled. The\r\nSchoolmaster, dragging him to the entrance of a second and still deeper\r\ncavern, thrust him into its hideous recesses, and closing and securely\r\nbolting a massy iron-shod door, returned to his worthy confederate, the\r\nChouette, who was waiting to join him in the proposed robbery (it might\r\nbe murder) in the Allee des Veuves.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of an hour Rodolph began, though slowly, to resume his\r\nconsciousness. He found himself extended on the ground, in the midst of\r\nthick darkness; he extended his hand and touched the stone stairs\r\ndescending to the vault; a sensation of extreme cold about his feet\r\ninduced him to endeavour, by feeling the ground, to ascertain the cause:\r\nhis fingers dabbled in a pool of water.\r\n\r\nWith a violent effort he contrived to seat himself on the lower step of\r\nthe staircase; the giddiness arising from his fall subsided by degrees,\r\nand as he became able to extend his limbs he found, to his great joy,\r\nthat, though severely shaken and contused, no bones were broken. He\r\nlistened: the only sound that reached his ear was a low, dull,\r\npattering, but continued noise, of which he was then far from divining\r\nthe cause.\r\n\r\nAs his senses became more clear, so did the circumstances, to which he\r\nhad been the unfortunate victim, return to his imagination; and just as\r\nhe had recalled each particular, and was deeply considering the possible\r\nresult of the whole, he became aware that his feet were wholly submerged\r\nin water; it had, indeed, risen above his ankle.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the heavy gloom and deep silence which surrounded him,\r\nhe heard still the same dull, trickling sound he had observed before;\r\nand now the matter was clear to him. Now, indeed, he comprehended all\r\nthe horrors of his situation: the cave was filling with water, arising\r\nfrom the fearful and formidable overflowing of the Seine,--the dungeon\r\nin which he had been thrown was doubtless beneath the level of the\r\nriver, and was chosen by his gaolers for that purpose, as offering a\r\nslow though certain means of destruction.\r\n\r\nThe conviction of his danger recalled Rodolph entirely to himself. Quick\r\nas lightning he made his way up the damp, slippery stairs; arrived at\r\nthe top, he came in contact with a thick door; he tried in vain to open\r\nit,--its massy hinges resisted his most vigorous efforts to force them.\r\n\r\nAt this moment of despair and danger, his first thought was for Murphy.\r\n"If he be not on his guard, those monsters will murder him!" cried he.\r\n"It will be I who shall have caused his death,--my good, my faithful\r\nMurphy!" This cruel thought nerved the arm of Rodolph with fresh vigour,\r\nand again he bent his most powerful energy to endeavour to force the\r\nponderous door. Alas! the thickly plated iron with which it was covered\r\nmocked his utmost efforts; and sore, weary, and exhausted, he was\r\ncompelled to relinquish the fruitless task. Again he descended into the\r\ncave, in hopes of obtaining something which might serve as a lever to\r\nforce the hinges or wrench the fastenings. Groping against the slimy\r\nwalls, he felt himself continually treading on some sort of round\r\nelastic bodies, which appeared to slip from under his feet, and to\r\nscramble for safety past him. They were rats, driven by the fast-rising\r\nwater from their retreats. Groping about the place on all fours, with\r\nthe water half way up his leg, Rodolph felt in all directions for the\r\nweapon he so much desired to find; nothing but the damp walls met his\r\ntouch, however, and, in utter despair, he resumed his position at the\r\ntop of the steps,--of the thirteen stairs which composed the flight,\r\nthree were already under water.\r\n\r\nThirteen had ever been Rodolph\'s unlucky number. There are moments when\r\nthe strongest minds are under the influence of superstitious ideas, and,\r\nat this juncture, Rodolph viewed the fatal amount of stairs as an ill\r\naugury. Again the possible fate of Murphy recurred to him, and, as if\r\ninspired by a fresh hope, he eagerly felt around the door to discover\r\nsome slight chink, or opening, by which his cries for help might be\r\nheard. In vain; the dampness of the soil had swollen the wood, and\r\njoined it hermetically to the wet, slimy earth.\r\n\r\nRodolph next tried the powers of his voice, and shouted with the fullest\r\nexpansion of his lungs, trusting that his cries for assistance might\r\nreach the adjoining cabaret; and then, tired and exhausted, sat down to\r\nlisten. Nothing was to be heard, no sound disturbed the deep silence\r\nwhich reigned, but the drop, drop, drop, the dull, trickling, monotonous\r\nbubbling of the fast-increasing waters.\r\n\r\nHis last hope extinguished, Rodolph seated himself in gloomy despair,\r\nand, leaning his back against the door, bewailed the perilous situation\r\nof his faithful friend,--perhaps at that very moment struggling beneath\r\nthe assassin\'s knife. Bitterly did he then regret his rash and\r\nventuresome projects, however good and generous the motives by which he\r\nhad been instigated; and severely did he reproach himself for having\r\ntaken advantage of the devotion of Murphy, who, rich, honoured, and\r\nesteemed by all who knew him, had quitted a beloved wife and child, to\r\nassist Rodolph in the bold undertaking he had imposed on himself.\r\n\r\nDuring these sorrowful reflections, the water was still rising rapidly,\r\nand five steps only now remained dry. Rodolph now found himself\r\ncompelled to assume a standing position, though, in so doing, his\r\nforehead was brought in close contact with the very top of the vault. He\r\ncalculated the probable duration of his mortal agony,--of the period\r\nwhich must elapse ere this slow, inch-like death would put a period to\r\nhis misery; he bethought him of the pistol he carried with him, and, at\r\nthe risk of injuring himself in the attempt, he determined to fire it\r\noff against the door, so as to disturb some of the fastenings by the\r\nconcussion; but here, again, a disappointment awaited him,--the pistol\r\nwas nowhere to be found, and he could but conclude it had fallen from\r\nhis pocket during his struggle with the Schoolmaster. But for his deep\r\nconcern on Murphy\'s account, Rodolph would have met his death\r\nunmoved,--his conscience acquitted him of all intentional offence; nay,\r\nit solaced him with the recollection of good actually performed, and\r\nmuch more meditated. To the decrees of an all-wise and inscrutable\r\nProvidence he resigned himself, and humbly accepted his present\r\npunishment as the just reward for a criminal action as yet unexpiated.\r\n\r\nA fresh trial of his fortitude awaited him. The rats, still pursued by\r\nthe fast-gathering waters, finding no other means of escape, sought\r\nrefuge from one step to another, ascending as fast as the rising flood\r\nrendered their position untenable; unable to scale the perpendicular\r\nwalls or doors, they availed themselves of the vestments of Rodolph,\r\nwhose horror and disgust rose to an indescribable degree, as he felt\r\ntheir cold, clammy paws, and wet, hairy bodies, crawling or clinging to\r\nhim; in his attempts to repulse them, their sharp, cold bite inflicted\r\non him a most acute agony, while his face and hands streamed with blood,\r\nfrom the multitude of wounds received. Again he called for help, shouted\r\naloud, and almost screamed in his pain and wretchedness. Alas! the dull\r\necho of the vault and the gurgling waters alone replied. A few short\r\nmoments, and he would be bereft even of the power of calling upon God or\r\nman to help him; the rapidly rising flood had now reached his very\r\nthroat, and ere long would have ascended to his lips.\r\n\r\nThe choked air began, too, to fail in the narrow space now left it, and\r\nthe first symptoms of asphyxia began to oppress Rodolph; the arteries of\r\nhis temples beat violently, his head became giddy, and the faint\r\nsickness of death seemed to make his chest heave convulsively. Already\r\nwere the waters gurgling in his ears; a dizziness of sight and a\r\nconfusion of ideas had well-nigh deprived him of all powers of sight or\r\nsound; the last glimmer of reason was well-nigh shaken from her throne,\r\nwhen hasty steps and the sound of voices on the other side of the door\r\nwere heard.\r\n\r\nHope recalled his expiring strength, and, making one powerful effort,\r\nRodolph was able to distinguish the following words, after which all\r\nconsciousness forsook him:\r\n\r\n"Did I not tell you so? There, you see there is no one here!"\r\n\r\n"Deuce take it! no more there is," replied the voice of the Chourineur,\r\nin a tone of vexation and disappointment. And the sounds died away.\r\n\r\nRodolph, utterly exhausted, had no longer power to sustain himself; his\r\nlimbs sunk from under him, and he slid unresistingly down the stone\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\nAll at once the door of the vault was abruptly opened from the other\r\nside, and the swelling masses contained in the inner vault, glad to find\r\na further outlet, rushed onwards as though bursting through the gates of\r\na sluice, and the Chourineur, whose opportune return shall be accounted\r\nfor by and by, seized the two arms of Rodolph, who, half dead, had\r\nmechanically clung to the threshold of the door, and bore him from the\r\nblack and rushing waters which had nigh proved his grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE SICK-NURSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSnatched by the Chourineur from a certain death, and removed to the\r\nhouse in the Allee des Veuves which had been reconnoitred by the\r\nChouette, previously to the attempt on it by the Schoolmaster, Rodolph\r\nwas placed in bed, in a comfortably furnished apartment; a cheerful fire\r\nwas burning on the hearth. A lamp, placed on a neighbouring table,\r\ndiffused a strong, clear light; while the bed of Rodolph, shaded by\r\nthick curtains of green damask, remained protected from the glare, and\r\nin the shadow of its deep recess.\r\n\r\nA negro of middle stature, with white hair and eyebrows, wearing an\r\norange and green riband at the buttonhole of his blue coat, sat by the\r\nbedside, holding in his right hand a seconds\' watch, which he appeared\r\nto consult while counting with his left the beating of Rodolph\'s pulse.\r\nThe expression of the negro\'s countenance was at once sad and pensive,\r\nand he continued from time to time to gaze on the sleeping man with the\r\nmost tender solicitude.\r\n\r\nThe Chourineur, clad in rags and soiled with mud, stood motionless, with\r\nfolded arms, at the foot of the bed; his red beard was long and matted,\r\nin disorder; his thick, bushy hair was tangled with mud and wet, which\r\nstill dripped from it; while his hard, bronzed features were marked by\r\nthe most profound pity for the patient: hardly venturing to breathe lest\r\nthe heaving of his huge chest should disturb the invalid, he awaited\r\nwith the most intense anxiety the result of the doctor\'s observations\r\non the sick man\'s state; then, as though to while away the fearful\r\napprehension of an unfavourable opinion, he continued to deliver his\r\nthoughts aloud, after the following manner:\r\n\r\n"Who would think, now, to see him lying there so helpless, he could ever\r\nhave been the man to give me such a precious drubbing as I got from him?\r\nI dare say, though, he will soon be up again, well and strong as ever.\r\nDon\'t you think so, M. le Docteur? Faith, I only wish he could drum\r\nhimself well upon my back; I\'d lend it him as long as he liked. But,\r\nperhaps, that would shake him too much, and overfatigue him; would it,\r\nsir?" addressing the negro, whose only reply was an impatient wave of\r\nthe hand.\r\n\r\nThe Chourineur was instantly silent.\r\n\r\n"The draught!" said the doctor.\r\n\r\nThe Chourineur, who had respectfully left his nailed shoes at the door,\r\nat these words arose, and walked towards the table indicated by the\r\nnegro\'s finger; going on the very top of his toes, drawing up his legs,\r\nextending his arms, and swelling out his back and shoulders, in a manner\r\nso ludicrous as, under other circumstances, would have been highly\r\ndiverting. The poor fellow seemed endeavouring to collect his whole\r\nweight, so that no portion of it should touch the floor; which, in spite\r\nof his energetic efforts to prevent it, groaned beneath his ponderous\r\nlimbs as they moved towards the desired spot. Unfortunately, between his\r\noveranxiety to acquit himself well in his important mission, and his\r\nfear of dropping the delicate phial he was bringing so overcarefully, he\r\ngrasped the slight neck so tightly in his huge hand that it shivered to\r\natoms, and the precious liquid was expended on the carpet.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of this unfortunate mischance the Chourineur remained in\r\nmute astonishment, one of his huge legs in the air, his toes nervously\r\ncontracted, and looking with a stupefied air alternately from the\r\ndoctor to the fragments of the bottle, and from that to the morsel his\r\nthumb and finger were yet tightly holding.\r\n\r\n"Awkward devil!" exclaimed the negro, impatiently.\r\n\r\n"Yes, that I am!" responded the Chourineur, as though grateful for the\r\nsound of a voice to break the frightful bewilderment of his ideas.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" cried the AEsculapius, observing the table attentively, "happily\r\nyou took the wrong phial,--I wanted the other one."\r\n\r\n"What, that little one with the red stuff?" inquired the unlucky\r\nsick-nurse, in a low and humble tone.\r\n\r\n"Of course I mean that; why, there is no other left."\r\n\r\nThe Chourineur, turning quickly around upon his heels, after his old\r\nmilitary fashion, crushed the fragments of glass which lay on the carpet\r\nbeneath his feet. More delicate ones might have suffered severely from\r\nthe circumstance, but the _ex-debardeur_ had a pair of natural sandals,\r\nhard as the hoofs of a horse.\r\n\r\n"Have a care!" cried the physician. "You will hurt yourself!"\r\n\r\nTo this caution the Chourineur paid no attention, but seemed wholly\r\nabsorbed in so discharging his new mission as should effectually destroy\r\nall recollection of his late clumsiness. It was really beautiful to\r\nbehold the scrupulous delicacy and lightness of touch with which,\r\nspreading out his two first fingers, he seized the fragile crystal;\r\navoiding all use of the unlucky thumb whose undue pressure, he rightly\r\nconceived, had brought about his previous accident, he kept so widely\r\nstretched from his forefinger that a butterfly might have passed\r\nbetween, with outspread wings, without losing one atom of its golden\r\nplumage. The black doctor trembled lest all this caution should lead to\r\na second misadventure, but, happily, the phial reached its destination\r\nin safety. As the Chourineur approached the bed, he again smashed\r\nbeneath his tread some of the fallen relics of the former potion.\r\n\r\n"The deuce take you, man! Do you want to _maim_ yourself for life?"\r\n\r\n"_Lame_ myself?" asked the eager nurse.\r\n\r\n"Why, yes; you keep walking upon glass as though you were trying for\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Oh, bless you! never mind that; the soles of my feet are hard as iron;\r\nmust be something sharper than glass could hurt them."\r\n\r\n"A teaspoon--" said the doctor.\r\n\r\nThe Chourineur recommenced his _evolutions sylphidiques_, and returned\r\nwith the article required.\r\n\r\nAfter having swallowed a few spoonfuls of the mixture, Rodolph began to\r\nstir in his bed, and faintly moved his hands.\r\n\r\n"Good! good! he is recovering from his stupor," said the doctor,\r\nspeaking to himself. "That bleeding has relieved him; he is now out of\r\ndanger."\r\n\r\n"Saved? Bravo! Vive la Charte!" exclaimed the Chourineur, in the full\r\nburst of his joy.\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue! and pray be quiet!" said the negro, in a tone of\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\n"To be sure I will, M. le Medecin."\r\n\r\n"His pulse is becoming regular--very well, indeed--excellent--"\r\n\r\n"And that poor friend of M. Rodolph\'s,--body and bones of me!--when he\r\ncomes to know that--But, then, luckily--"\r\n\r\n"Silence! I say."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, M. le Docteur."\r\n\r\n"And sit down."\r\n\r\n"But, M. le--"\r\n\r\n"Sit down, I tell you! You disturb me, twisting and fidgeting about in\r\nthat manner,--you distract my attention. Come, sit down at once, and\r\nkeep still."\r\n\r\n"But, doctor, don\'t you perceive I am as dirty as a pile of floating\r\nwood just going to be unloaded?--all slime and wet, you see. I should\r\nspoil the furniture."\r\n\r\n"Then sit down on the ground."\r\n\r\n"I should soil the carpet."\r\n\r\n"Do what you like, but, for heaven\'s sake, be quiet!" said the doctor,\r\nin a tone of impatience; then, throwing himself into an armchair, he\r\nleaned his head upon his clasped hands, and appeared lost in deep\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment of profound meditation, the Chourineur, less from any\r\nneed he felt for repose than in obedience to the doctor\'s commands, took\r\na chair with the utmost precaution, turned it upside down with an air of\r\nintense self-satisfaction at having at length devised a plan to act in\r\nstrict conformity with the orders received, and yet avoid all risk of\r\nsoiling the silken cushion; having laid the back on the ground, he\r\nproceeded, after all manner of delicate arrangements, to take his seat\r\non the outer rails; but, unhappily, the Chourineur was entirely ignorant\r\nof the laws of the lever and the equilibrium of bodies, the chair\r\noverbalanced, and the luckless individual seated thereon, in\r\nendeavouring to save himself from falling, by an involuntary movement\r\ncaught hold of a small stand, on which was a tray containing some\r\ntea-things.\r\n\r\nAt the formidable noise caused by so many falling articles clattering\r\nupon the head of the unfortunate cause of all this discord and havoc,\r\nthe doctor sprung from his seat, while Rodolph, awaking with a start,\r\nraised himself on his elbow, looked about him with an anxious and\r\nperturbed glance, then, passing his hand over his brows, as though\r\ntrying to arrange his ideas, he inquired:\r\n\r\n"Where is Murphy?"\r\n\r\n"Your royal highness need be under no apprehensions on his account,"\r\nanswered the negro, respectfully; "there is every hope of his recovery."\r\n\r\n"Recovery! He is, then, wounded?"\r\n\r\n"Unhappily, my lord, he is."\r\n\r\n"Where is he? Let me see him!" And Rodolph endeavoured to rise, but fell\r\nback again, overcome by weakness and the intense pain he felt from his\r\nmany and severe contusions. "Since I cannot walk," cried he, at length,\r\n"let me be instantly carried to Murphy,--this moment!"\r\n\r\n"My lord, he sleeps at present; it would be highly dangerous, at this\r\nparticular juncture, to expose him to the slightest agitation."\r\n\r\n"You are deceiving me, and he is dead! He has been murdered! And I--I am\r\nthe wretched cause of it!" cried Rodolph, in a tone of agony, raising\r\nhis clasped hands towards heaven.\r\n\r\n"My lord knows that his servant is incapable of a falsehood. I assert by\r\nmy honour, that, although severely wounded, Murphy lives, and that his\r\nchance of recovery is all but certain."\r\n\r\n"You say that but to prepare me for more disastrous tidings; he lies,\r\ndoubtless, wounded past all hope; and he, my faithful friend, will die!"\r\n\r\n"My lord--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you are seeking to deceive me till all is over. But I will see\r\nhim,--I will judge for myself; the sight of a friend cannot be hurtful.\r\nLet me be instantly removed to his chamber."\r\n\r\n"Once more, my lord, I pledge my solemn assurance, that, barring chances\r\nnot likely to occur, Murphy will soon be convalescent."\r\n\r\n"My dear David, may I indeed believe you?"\r\n\r\n"You may, indeed, my lord."\r\n\r\n"Hear me. You know the high opinion I entertain of your ability and\r\nknowledge, and that, from the hour in which you were attached to my\r\nhousehold, you have possessed my most unbounded confidence,--never, for\r\none instant, have I doubted your great skill and perfect acquaintance\r\nwith your profession; but I conjure you, if a consultation be\r\nnecessary--"\r\n\r\n"My lord, that would have been my first thought, had I seen the\r\nslightest reason for such a step; but, up to the present moment, it\r\nwould be both useless and unnecessary. And, besides, I should be\r\nsomewhat tenacious of introducing strangers into the house until I knew\r\nwhether your orders of yesterday--"\r\n\r\n"But how has all this happened?" said Rodolph, interrupting the black.\r\n"Who saved me from drowning in that horrid cellar? I have a confused\r\nrecollection of having heard the Chourineur\'s voice there; was I\r\nmistaken?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all mistaken, my lord. But let the brave fellow, to whom all\r\npraise is due, relate the affair in which he was the principal actor\r\nhimself."\r\n\r\n"Where is he? Where is he?"\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked about for the recently elected sick-nurse, and at\r\nlength found him, thoroughly silenced and shamed by his late tumble,\r\nensconced behind the curtains of the bed.\r\n\r\n"Here he is," said the doctor; "he looks somewhat shamefaced."\r\n\r\n"Come forward, my brave fellow!" said Rodolph, extending his hand to his\r\npreserver.\r\n\r\nThe confusion of the poor Chourineur was still further increased from\r\nhaving, when behind his curtain, heard the black doctor address Rodolph\r\ncontinually as "my lord," or "your royal highness."\r\n\r\n"Approach, my friend,--my deliverer!" said Rodolph, "and give me your\r\nhand."\r\n\r\n"I beg pardon, sir,--I mean, my lord,--no, highness,--no--"\r\n\r\n"Call me M. Rodolph, as you used to do; I like it better."\r\n\r\n"And so do I,--it comes so much easier to one. But be so good as to\r\nexcuse my hand; I have done so much work lately, that--"\r\n\r\n"Your hand, I tell you,--your hand!"\r\n\r\nOvercome by this kind and persevering command, the Chourineur timidly\r\nextended his black and horny palm, which Rodolph warmly shook.\r\n\r\n"Now, then, sit down, and tell me all about it,--how you discovered the\r\ncellar. But I think I can guess. The Schoolmaster?"\r\n\r\n"We have him in safety," said the black doctor.\r\n\r\n"Yes, he and the Chouette, tied together like two rolls of tobacco. A\r\npair of pretty creatures they look, as ever you would wish to see, and,\r\nI doubt not, sick enough of each other\'s company by this time."\r\n\r\n"And my poor Murphy! What a selfish wretch must I be to think only of\r\nmyself! Where is he wounded, David?"\r\n\r\n"In the right side, my lord; but, fortunately, towards the lower false\r\nrib."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I must have a deep and terrible revenge for this! David, I depend\r\nupon your assistance."\r\n\r\n"My lord knows full well that I am wholly devoted to him, both body and\r\nsoul," replied the negro, coldly.\r\n\r\n"But how, my noble fellow, were you able to arrive here in time?" said\r\nRodolph to the Chourineur.\r\n\r\n"Why, if you please, my lor--no, sir--highness--Rodolph--I had better\r\nbegin by the beginning--"\r\n\r\n"Quite right. I am listening,--go on. But mind, you are only to call me\r\nM. Rodolph."\r\n\r\n"Very well. You know that last night you told me, after you returned\r\nfrom the country, where you had gone with poor Goualeuse, \'Try and find\r\nthe Schoolmaster in the Cite; tell him you know of a capital "put-up,"\r\nthat you have refused to join it, but that if he will take your place he\r\nhas only to be to-morrow (that\'s to-day) at the barrier of Bercy, at the\r\nPanier-Fleuri, and there he will see the man who has "made the plant"\r\n(_qui a nourri le poupard_).\'"\r\n\r\n"Well."\r\n\r\n"On leaving you, I pushed on briskly for the Cite. I goes to the\r\nogress\'s,--no Schoolmaster; then to the Rue Saint Eloi; on to the Rue\r\naux Feves; then to the Rue de la Vieille Draperie,--couldn\'t find my\r\nman. At last I stumbled upon him and that old devil\'s kin, Chouette, in\r\nthe front of Notre Dame, at the shop of a tailor, who is a \'fence\'[8]\r\nand thief; they were \'sporting the blunt\' which they had prigged from\r\nthe tall gentleman in black, who wanted to do something to you; they\r\nbought themselves some toggery. The Chouette bargained for a red\r\nshawl,--an old monster! I told my tale to the Schoolmaster and he\r\nsnapped at it, and said he would be at the rendezvous accordingly. So\r\nfar so good. This morning, according to your orders, I ran here to bring\r\nyou the answer. You said to me, \'My lad, return to-morrow before\r\ndaybreak; you must pass the day in the house, and in the evening you\r\nwill see something which will be worth seeing.\' You did not let out more\r\nthan that, but I was \'fly,\' and said to myself, \'This is a "dodge" to\r\ncatch the Schoolmaster to-morrow, by laying a right bait for him. He is\r\na----scoundrel; he murdered the cattle-dealer, and, as they say, another\r\nperson besides, in the Rue du Roule. I see all about it--\'"\r\n\r\n  [8] Receiver of stolen goods.\r\n\r\n"My mistake was not to have told you all, my good fellow; then this\r\nhorrible result would not have occurred."\r\n\r\n"That was your affair, M. Rodolph; all that concerned me was to serve\r\nyou; for, truth to say, I don\'t know how or why, but, as I have told you\r\nbefore, I feel as if I were your bulldog. But that\'s enough. I said,\r\nthen, \'M. Rodolph pays me for my time, so my time is his, and I will\r\nemploy it for him.\' Then an idea strikes me: the Schoolmaster is\r\ncunning, he may suspect a trap. M. Rodolph will propose to him the job\r\nfor to-morrow, it is true, but the \'downy cove\' is likely enough to come\r\nto-day and lurk about, and reconnoitre the ground, and if he is\r\nsuspicious of M. Rodolph he will bring some other \'cracksman\' (robber)\r\nwith him, and do the trick on his own account. To prevent this, I said\r\nto myself, \'I must go and plant myself somewhere where I may get a view\r\nof the walls, the garden-gate,--there is no other entrance. If I find a\r\nsnug corner, as it rains, I will remain there all day, perhaps all\r\nnight, and to-morrow morning I shall be all right and ready to go to M.\r\nRodolph\'s.\' So I goes to the Allee des Veuves to place myself, and what\r\nshould I see but a small tavern, not ten paces from your door! I entered\r\nand took my seat near the window, in a room on the ground floor. I\r\ncalled for a quart of drink and a quart of nuts, saying I expected some\r\nfriends,--a humpbacked man and a tall woman. I chose them because it\r\nwould appear more natural. I was very comfortably seated, and kept my\r\neye on the door. It rained cats and dogs; no one passed; night came\r\non--"\r\n\r\n"But," interrupted Rodolph, "why did you not go at once to my house?"\r\n\r\n"You told me to come the next day morning, M. Rodolph, and I didn\'t dare\r\nreturn there sooner; I should have looked like an intruder,--a sneak\r\n(_brosseur_), as the troopers call it. You understand? Well, there I was\r\nat the window of the wine-shop, cracking my nuts and drinking my liquor,\r\nwhen, through the fog, I saw the Chouette approach, accompanied by Bras\r\nRouge\'s brat, little Tortillard. \'Ah, ah!\' said I to myself, \'now the\r\nfarce begins!\' Well, the little hound of a child hid himself in one of\r\nthe ditches of the Allee, and was evidently on the lookout. As for\r\nthat----, the Chouette, she takes off her bonnet, puts it into her\r\npocket, and rings the gate-bell. Our poor friend, M. Murphy, opens the\r\ndoor, and the one-eyed mother of mischief tosses up her arms and makes\r\nher way into the garden. I could have kicked myself for not being able\r\nto make out what the Chouette was up to. At last out she comes, puts on\r\nher bonnet, says two words to Tortillard, who returns to his hole, and\r\nthen \'cuts her stick.\' I say to myself, \'Caution! no blunder now!\r\nTortillard has come with the Chouette; then the Schoolmaster and M.\r\nRodolph are at Bras Rouge\'s. The Chouette has come out to reconnoitre\r\nabout the house; then, sure as a gun, they\'ll "try it on" this very\r\nnight! If they do, M. Rodolph, who believes they will not go to work\r\ntill to-morrow, is quite over-reached; and if he is over-reached, I\r\nought to go to Bras Rouge\'s and see for him. True; but then suppose that\r\nthe Schoolmaster arrives in the meantime,--that\'s to be thought of.\r\nSuppose I go to the house and see M. Murphy,--mind your eye! that urchin\r\nTortillard is near the door; he will hear me ring the bell, see me, and\r\ngive the word to the Chouette; and if she returns, that will spoil all;\r\nand the more particularly as perhaps M. Rodolph has, after all, made his\r\narrangements for this evening.\' Confound it! these yes and no bothered\r\nmy brain tremendously. I was quite bewildered, and saw nothing clear\r\nbefore me. I didn\'t know what to do for the best, so I said, \'I\'ll walk\r\nout, and perhaps the clear air will brighten my thoughts a bit.\' I went\r\nout, and the open air cleared my brain; so I took off my blouse and my\r\nneck-handkerchief, I went to the ditch where Tortillard lay, and taking\r\nthe young devil\'s kin by the cuff of his neck,--how he did wriggle, and\r\ntwist, and scuffle, and scratch!--I put him into my blouse, tying up one\r\nend with the sleeves and the bottom tightly with my cravat. He could\r\nbreathe very well. Well, then I took the bundle under my arm, and\r\npassing a low, damp garden, surrounded by a little wall, I threw the\r\nbrat Tortillard into the midst of a cabbage-bed. He squeaked like a\r\nsucking-pig, but nobody could hear him two steps off. I cut off; it was\r\ntime. I climbed up one of the high trees in the Allee, just in front of\r\nyour door, and over the ditch in which Tortillard had been stationed.\r\nTen minutes afterwards I heard footsteps; it was raining still, and the\r\nnight was very dark. I listened,--it was the Chouette. \'Tortillard!\r\nTortillard!\' says she, in a low voice. \'It rains, and the little brat is\r\ntired of waiting,\' said the Schoolmaster, swearing; \'if I catch him,\r\nI\'ll skin him alive!\' \'_Fourline_, take care!\' replied the Chouette.\r\n\'Perhaps he has gone to warn us of something that has happened,--maybe,\r\nsome trap for us. The young fellow would not make the attempt till ten\r\no\'clock.\' \'That\'s the very reason,\' replies the Schoolmaster; \'it is now\r\nonly seven o\'clock. You saw the money,--nothing venture, nothing have.\r\nGive me the ripping chisel and the jemmy--\'"\r\n\r\n"What instruments are they?" asked Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"They came from Bras Rouge\'s. Oh, he has a well-furnished house! In a\r\ncrack the door is opened. \'Stay where you are,\' said the Schoolmaster to\r\nthe Chouette; \'keep a bright lookout, and give me the signal if you hear\r\nanything.\' \'Put your "pinking-iron" in the buttonhole of your waistcoat,\r\nthat you may have it handy,\' said the old hag. The Schoolmaster entered\r\nthe garden, and I instantly, coming down from the tree, fell on the\r\nChouette. I silenced her with two blows of my fist,--my new style,--and\r\nshe fell without a word. I ran into the garden, but, thunder and\r\nlightning, M. Rodolph! it was too late--"\r\n\r\n"Poor Murphy!"\r\n\r\n"He was struggling on the ground with the Schoolmaster at the entrance,\r\nand, although wounded, he held his voice and made no cry for help.\r\nExcellent man! he is like a good dog, bites, but doesn\'t bark. Well, I\r\nwent bang, heads or tails, at it, hitting the Schoolmaster on the\r\nshoulder, which was the only place I could at the moment touch. \'Vive la\r\nCharte! it\'s I!\' \'The Chourineur!\' shouts M. Murphy. \'Ah, villain! where\r\ndo you come from?\' cries out the Schoolmaster, quite off his guard at\r\nthat. \'What\'s that to you?\' says I, fixing one of his legs between my\r\nknees, and grasping his \'fin\' with my other hand; it was that in which\r\nhe held his dagger. \'And M. Rodolph?\' asked M. Murphy of me, whilst\r\ndoing all in his power to aid me--"\r\n\r\n"Worthy, kind-hearted creature!" murmured Rodolph, in a tone of deep\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\n"\'I know nothing of him,\' says I; \'this scoundrel, perhaps, has killed\r\nhim.\' And then I went with redoubled strength at the Schoolmaster, who\r\ntried to stick me with his larding-pin; but I lay with my breast on his\r\narm, and so he only had his fist at liberty. \'You are, then, quite\r\nalone?\' says I to M. Murphy, whilst we still struggled desperately with\r\nthe Schoolmaster. \'There are people close at hand,\' he replied; \'but\r\nthey did not hear me cry out.\' \'Is it far off?\' \'They would be here in\r\nten minutes.\' \'Let us call out for help; there are passers-by who will\r\ncome and help us.\' \'No, as we have got him we must hold him here. But I\r\nam growing weak, I am wounded.\' \'Thunder and lightning! then run and get\r\nassistance, if you have strength left; I will try and hold him.\' M.\r\nMurphy then disengaged himself, and I was alone with the Schoolmaster. I\r\ndon\'t want to brag, but, by Jove! these were moments when I was not\r\nhaving a holiday. We were half on the ground, half on the bottom step of\r\nthe flight. I had my arms round the neck of the villain, my cheek\r\nagainst his cheek; and he was puffing like a bull, I heard his teeth\r\ngrind. It was dark, it rained pouring; the lamp left in the passage\r\nlighted us a little. I had twisted one of my legs around his, but, in\r\nspite of that, his loins were so powerful that he moved himself and me\r\non to the bare ground. He tried to bite me, but couldn\'t; I never felt\r\nso strong. Thunder! my heart beat, but it was in the right place. I\r\nsaid, \'I am like a man who is grappling with a mad dog, to prevent him\r\nfrom fastening on some passer-by.\' \'Let me go, and I will do you no\r\nharm,\' said the Schoolmaster, in an exhausted voice. \'What! a coward?\'\r\nsays I to him. \'So, then, your pluck is in your strength? So you\r\nwouldn\'t have stabbed the cattle-dealer at Poissy, and robbed him, if he\r\nhad only been as strong as me, eh?\' \'No,\' says he; \'but I will kill you\r\nas I did him.\' And saying that, he made so violent a heave, and gave so\r\npowerful a jerk with his legs at the same time, that he half threw me\r\nover; if I had not kept a tight hold of his wrist which held the\r\nstiletto, I was done for. At this moment my left hand was seized with\r\nthe cramp, and I was compelled to loosen my hold; that nearly spoiled\r\nall, and I said to myself, \'I am now undermost and he at top,--he\'ll\r\nkill me. Never mind, I had rather be in my place than his; M. Rodolph\r\nsaid that I had heart and honour.\' I felt it was all over with me, and\r\nat that moment I saw the Chouette standing close by us, with her glaring\r\neye and red shawl. Thunder and lightning! I thought I had the nightmare.\r\n\'Finette,\' cries the Schoolmaster, \'I have let fall the knife; pick it\r\nup, there, there, under him, and strike him home, in the back, between\r\nthe shoulders; quick! quick!\' \'Only wait, only wait till I find it, till\r\nI see it, _fourline_.\' And then the cursed Chouette turned and poked\r\nabout us, like an old bird of mischief as she was. At last she found the\r\ndagger and sprung towards it, but as I was flat on my belly I gave her a\r\nkick in the stomach, which sent her neck over crop; she got up, and in a\r\ndesperate rage. I could do no more; I still held on and struggled with\r\nthe Schoolmaster, but he kept giving me such dreadful blows on my jaw\r\nthat I was about to let go my hold, when I saw three or four armed men\r\nwho came down the stairs, and M. Murphy, pale as ashes, and with\r\ndifficulty supporting himself with the assistance of the doctor here.\r\nThey seized hold of the Schoolmaster and the Chouette, and soon bound\r\nthem hand and foot. That was not all, I still wanted M. Rodolph. I\r\nsprang at the Chouette; remembering the tooth of the poor dear\r\nGoualeuse, I grasped her arm and twisted it, saying, \'Where is M.\r\nRodolph?\' She bore it well, and silently. I took a second turn, and then\r\nshe screeched out, \'At Bras Rouge\'s, in the vault at the Bleeding\r\nHeart!\' All right! As I went, I meant to take Tortillard from his\r\ncabbage-bed, as it was on my road. I looked for him, but only found my\r\nblouse,--he had gnawed his way out with his teeth. I reached the\r\nBleeding Heart, and I laid hold of Bras Rouge. \'Where is the young man\r\nwho came here this evening with the Schoolmaster?\' \'Don\'t squeeze so\r\nhard, and I\'ll tell you. They wanted to play him a trick and shut him up\r\nin my cellar; we\'ll go now and let him out.\' We went down, but there was\r\nno one to be seen. \'He must have gone out whilst my back was turned,\'\r\nsays Bras Rouge; \'you see plain enough he is not here.\' I was going away\r\nsad enough, when, by the light of the lantern, I saw at the bottom of\r\nthe cellar another door. I ran towards it and opened the door, and had,\r\nas it were, a pail of water thrown at me. I saw your two poor arms in\r\nthe air. I fished you out and brought you here on my back, as there was\r\nnobody at hand to get a coach. That\'s all my tale, M. Rodolph; and I may\r\nsay, without bragging, that I am satisfied with myself."\r\n\r\n"My man, I owe my life to you; it is a heavy debt, but be assured I will\r\npay it. David, will you go and learn how Murphy is," added Rodolph, "and\r\nreturn again instantly?"\r\n\r\nThe black went out.\r\n\r\n"Where is the Schoolmaster, my good fellow?"\r\n\r\n"In another room, with the Chouette. You will send for the police, M.\r\nRodolph?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"You surely will not let him go! Ah, M. Rodolph, none of that\r\nnonsensical generosity! I say again, he is a mad dog,--let the\r\npassengers look out!"\r\n\r\n"He will never bite again, be assured."\r\n\r\n"Then you are going to shut him up somewhere?"\r\n\r\n"No; in half an hour he will leave this house."\r\n\r\n"The Schoolmaster?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Without _gens-d\'armes_?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"_He_ will go out from here, and free?"\r\n\r\n"Free."\r\n\r\n"And quite alone?"\r\n\r\n"Quite alone."\r\n\r\n"But he will go--"\r\n\r\n"Wherever he likes," said Rodolph, interrupting the Chourineur with a\r\nmeaning smile.\r\n\r\nThe black returned.\r\n\r\n"Well, David, well, and how is Murphy?"\r\n\r\n"He sleeps, my lord," said the doctor, despondingly; "his respiration is\r\nvery difficult."\r\n\r\n"Not out of danger?"\r\n\r\n"His case is very critical, my lord; yet there is hope."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Murphy! vengeance! vengeance!" exclaimed Rodolph, in a tone of\r\nconcentrated rage. Then he added, "David, a word--"\r\n\r\nAnd he whispered something in the ear of the black. He started back.\r\n\r\n"Do you hesitate?" said Rodolph. "Yet I have often suggested this idea\r\nto you; the moment is come to put it into practice."\r\n\r\n"I do not hesitate, my lord; the suggestion is well worthy the\r\nconsideration of the most elevated jurists, for this punishment is at\r\nthe same time terrible and yet fruitful for repentance. In this case it\r\nis most applicable. Without enumerating the crimes which have\r\naccumulated to send this wretch to the Bagne for his life, he has\r\ncommitted three murders,--the cattle-dealer, Murphy, and yourself; it is\r\nin his case justice--"\r\n\r\n"He will have before him an unlimited horizon for expiation," added\r\nRodolph. After a moment\'s silence he resumed: "And five thousand francs\r\nwill suffice, David?"\r\n\r\n"Amply, my lord."\r\n\r\n"My good fellow," said Rodolph to the bewildered Chourineur, "I have two\r\nwords to say to M. David; will you go into that chamber on the other\r\nside, where you will see a large red pocketbook on a bureau; open it and\r\ntake out five notes of a thousand francs each, and bring them to me."\r\n\r\n"And," inquired the Chourineur, involuntarily, "who are those five\r\nthousand francs for?"\r\n\r\n"For the Schoolmaster. And do you, at the same time, tell them to bring\r\nhim in here."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE PUNISHMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scene we are about to describe took place in a room hung with red,\r\nand brilliantly lighted. Rodolph, clothed in a long dressing-gown of\r\nblack velvet, which increased the pallor of his features, was seated\r\nbefore a large table covered with a green cloth. On this table was the\r\nSchoolmaster\'s pocketbook, the pinchbeck chain of the Chouette (to which\r\nwas suspended the little Saint Esprit of lapis lazuli), the\r\nblood-stained stiletto with which Murphy had been stabbed, the crowbar\r\nwith which the door had been forced, and the five notes of a thousand\r\nfrancs each, which the Chourineur had fetched out of the next apartment.\r\n\r\nThe negro doctor was seated at one side of the table, the Chourineur on\r\nthe other. The Schoolmaster, tightly bound with cords, and unable to\r\nmove a limb, was placed in a large armchair on casters, in the middle of\r\nthe salon. The people who had brought in this man had withdrawn, and\r\nRodolph, the doctor, the Chourineur, and the assassin were left alone.\r\nRodolph was no longer out of temper, but calm, sad, and collected; he\r\nwas about to discharge a solemn, self-imposed, and important duty. The\r\ndoctor was lost in meditation. The Chourineur felt an indescribable\r\nfear; he could not take his eyes off Rodolph. The Schoolmaster\'s\r\ncountenance was ghastly; he was in an agony of fear. The most profound\r\nsilence reigned within; nothing was heard but the splash, splash of the\r\nrain without, as it fell from the roof on to the pavement. Rodolph\r\naddressed the Schoolmaster:\r\n\r\n"Anselm Duresnel, you have escaped from the Bagne at Rochefort, where\r\nyou were condemned for life for forgery, robbery, and murder!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s false!" said the Schoolmaster, in a hollow voice, and looking\r\nabout him with his restless and glaring glance.\r\n\r\n"You are Anselm Duresnel, and you murdered and robbed a cattle-dealer on\r\nthe road to Poissy--"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a lie!"\r\n\r\n"You shall confess it presently."\r\n\r\nThe scoundrel looked at Rodolph with an air of astonishment.\r\n\r\n"This very night you came here to rob, and you have stabbed the master\r\nof this house--"\r\n\r\n"It was you who suggested this robbery!" assuming an air of assurance.\r\n"I was attacked, and I defended myself."\r\n\r\n"The man you stabbed did not attack you,--he was unarmed. True, I did\r\nsuggest this robbery to you,--I\'ll tell you why. Last night only, after\r\nhaving robbed a man and woman in the Cite, you offered to kill me for a\r\nthousand francs--"\r\n\r\n"I heard him," said the Chourineur.\r\n\r\nThe Schoolmaster darted at him a glance of deadliest hate.\r\n\r\nRodolph continued:\r\n\r\n"You see there was no occasion to tempt you to do mischief."\r\n\r\n"You are not my judge, and I will not answer you another question."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "_Rodolph Addressed the Schoolmaster_"\r\nEtching by Mercier, after the drawing by Frank T. Merrill]\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you why I proposed this robbery to you. I knew you were a\r\nrunaway convict,--you know the parents of the unfortunate girl, all\r\nwhose misfortunes have been caused by your miserable accomplice, the\r\nChouette. I wished to draw you here by the temptation of a robbery,\r\nbecause this was the only temptation that could avail with you. Once in\r\nmy power, I leave you the choice of being handed over to the hands of\r\njustice, which will make you pay with your head the assassination of the\r\ncattle-dealer--"\r\n\r\n"It is false! I did not commit that crime."\r\n\r\n"Or of being conducted out of France, under my direction, to a place of\r\nperpetual confinement, where your lot will be less painful than at the\r\nBagne; but I will only allow you this relaxation of punishment on\r\ncondition that you give me the information which I desire to acquire.\r\nCondemned for life, you have broken away from your confinement, and by\r\nseizing upon you and placing you hereafter beyond the possibility of\r\ndoing injury, I serve society; and from your confession I may, perhaps,\r\nfind the means of restoring to her family a poor creature much more\r\nunfortunate than guilty. This was my first intention,--it was not legal;\r\nbut your escape and your fresh crimes forbid any such course on my part\r\nnow, and place you beyond all law. Yesterday, by a remarkable\r\nrevelation, I discovered that you are Anselm Duresnel--"\r\n\r\n"It\'s false! I am not called Duresnel."\r\n\r\nRodolph took from the table the chain of the Chouette, and pointing to\r\nthe little Saint Esprit of lapis lazuli said, in a threatening voice:\r\n\r\n"Sacrilege! You have prostituted to an infamous wretch this holy\r\nrelic,--thrice holy, for your infant boy had this pious gift from his\r\nmother and grandmother!"\r\n\r\nThe Schoolmaster, dumfounded at this discovery, lowered his head and\r\nmade no response.\r\n\r\n"You carried off your child from his mother fifteen years ago, and you\r\nalone possess the secret of his existence. I had in this an additional\r\nmotive for laying hands on you when I had detected who you were. I seek\r\nno revenge for what you have done to me personally, but to-night you\r\nhave again shed blood without provocation. The man you have assassinated\r\ncame to you in full confidence, not suspecting your sanguinary purpose.\r\nHe asked you what you wanted: \'Your money or your life!\' and you stabbed\r\nhim with your poniard."\r\n\r\n"So M. Murphy said when I first came to his aid," said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"It\'s false! He lied!"\r\n\r\n"Murphy never lies," said Rodolph, calmly. "Your crimes demand a\r\nstriking reparation. You came into this garden forcibly; you stabbed a\r\nman that you might rob him; you have committed another murder; you ought\r\nto die on this spot; but pity, respect for your wife and son, they shall\r\nsave you from the shame of a scaffold. It will be said that you were\r\nkilled in a brawl with weapons in your hand. Prepare, the means for your\r\npunishment are at hand."\r\n\r\nRodolph\'s countenance was implacable. The Schoolmaster had remarked in\r\nthe next room two men, armed with carbines. His name was known; he\r\nthought they were going to make away with him and bury in the shade his\r\nlater crimes, and thus spare his family the new opprobrium. Like his\r\nfellows, this wretch was as cowardly as he was ferocious. Thinking his\r\nhour was come, he trembled, and cried "Mercy!"\r\n\r\n"No mercy for you," said Rodolph. "If your brains are not blown out\r\nhere, the scaffold awaits you--"\r\n\r\n"I prefer the scaffold,--I shall live, at least, two or three months\r\nlonger. Why, why should I be punished at once? Mercy! mercy!"\r\n\r\n"But your wife--your son--they bear your name--"\r\n\r\n"My name is dishonoured already. If only for eight days, let me live! in\r\nmercy do!"\r\n\r\n"Not even that contempt of life which is sometimes displayed by the\r\ngreatest criminals!" said Rodolph, with disgust.\r\n\r\n"Besides, the law forbids any one to take justice into their own hands,"\r\nsaid the Schoolmaster, with assurance.\r\n\r\n"The law! the _law!_" exclaimed Rodolph. "Do you dare to invoke the\r\nlaw? you, who have always lived in open revolt and constant enmity\r\nagainst society?"\r\n\r\nThe ruffian bowed his head and made no answer; then added, in a more\r\nhumble tone:\r\n\r\n"At least, for pity\'s sake, spare my life!"\r\n\r\n"Will you tell me where your son is?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I will tell you all I know."\r\n\r\n"Will you tell me who are the parents of the young girl whose childhood\r\nthe Chouette made one scene of torture?"\r\n\r\n"In my pocketbook there are papers which will put you on the track of\r\nthe persons who gave her to the Chouette."\r\n\r\n"Where is your son?"\r\n\r\n"Will you let me live?"\r\n\r\n"First make a full confession."\r\n\r\n"And then, when I have told you all--" said the Schoolmaster with\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\n"You have killed him!"\r\n\r\n"No, no! I have confided him to one of my accomplices, who, when I was\r\napprehended, effected his escape."\r\n\r\n"What did he do with him?"\r\n\r\n"He brought him up, and gave him an education which fitted him to enter\r\ninto a banking-house at Nantes, so that we might get information, manage\r\nan introduction to the banker, and so facilitate our plans. Although at\r\nRochefort, and preparing for my escape, I arranged this plan and\r\ncorresponded in cipher with my friend--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, _mon Dieu!_ his child! his son! This man appals me!" cried Rodolph,\r\nwith horror, and hiding his head between his hands.\r\n\r\n"But it was only of forgery that we thought," exclaimed the scoundrel;\r\n"and when my son was informed what was expected of him, he was\r\nindignant, told all to his employer, and quitted Nantes. You will find\r\nin my pocketbook notes of all the steps taken to discover his traces.\r\nThe last place we ascertained he had lived in was the Rue du Temple,\r\nwhere he was known under the name of Francois Germain; the exact address\r\nis also in my pocketbook. You see I do not wish to conceal anything,--I\r\nhave told you everything I know. Now keep your promise. I only ask you\r\nto have me taken into custody for _this_ night\'s robbery."\r\n\r\n"And the cattle-merchant at Poissy?"\r\n\r\n"That affair can never be brought to light,--there are no proofs. I own\r\nit to _you_, in proof of the sincerity with which I am speaking, but\r\nbefore any other person I should deny all knowledge of the business."\r\n\r\n"You confess it, then, do you?"\r\n\r\n"I was destitute, without the smallest means of living,--the Chouette\r\ninstigated me to do it; but now I sincerely repent ever having listened\r\nto her. I do, indeed. Ah! would you but generously save me from the\r\nhands of justice, I would promise you most solemnly to forsake all such\r\nevil practices for the future."\r\n\r\n"Be satisfied, your life shall be spared; neither will I deliver you\r\ninto the hands of the law."\r\n\r\n"Do you, then, pardon me?" exclaimed the Schoolmaster, as though\r\ndoubting what he heard. "Can it be? Can you be so generous as to\r\nforgive?"\r\n\r\n"I both judge you and award your sentence," cried Rodolph, in a solemn\r\ntone. "I will not surrender you to the power of the laws, because they\r\nwould condemn you to the galleys or the scaffold; and that must not be.\r\nNo, for many reasons. The galleys would but open a fresh field for the\r\ndevelopment of your brutal strength and villainy, which would soon be\r\nexercised in endeavouring to obtain domination over the guilty or\r\nunfortunate beings you would be associated with, to render yourself a\r\nfresh object of horror or of dread; for even crime has its ambition, and\r\nyours has long consisted in a pre-eminence in vicious deeds and monstrous\r\nvices, while your iron frame would alike defy the labours of the oar or\r\nthe chastisement of those set over you. And the strongest chains may be\r\nbroken, the thickest wall pierced through,--steep ramparts have been\r\nscaled before now,--and you might one day burst your yoke and be again\r\nlet loose upon society, like an infuriated beast, marking your passage\r\nwith murder and destruction; for none would be safe from your Herculean\r\nstrength, or from the sharpness of your knife; therefore such\r\nconsequences must be avoided. But since the galleys might fail to stop\r\nyour infamous career, how is society to be preserved from your brutal\r\nviolence? The scaffold comes next in consideration--"\r\n\r\n"It is my life, then, you seek!" cried the ruffian. "My life! Oh, spare\r\nit!"\r\n\r\n"Peace, coward! Hope not that I mean so speedy a termination to your\r\njust punishment. No; your eager craving after a wretched existence would\r\nprevent you from suffering the agony of anticipated death, and, far from\r\ndwelling upon the scaffold and the block, your guilty soul would be\r\nfilled with schemes of escape and hopes of pardon; neither would you\r\nbelieve you were truly doomed to die till in the very grasp of the\r\nexecutioner; and even in that terrible moment it is probable that,\r\nbrutalised by terror, you would be a mere mass of human flesh, offered\r\nup by justice as an expiatory offering to the manes of your victims.\r\nThat mode of settling your long and heavy accounts will not half pay the\r\ndebt. No; poor, wretched, trembling craven! we must devise a more\r\nterrific method of atonement for you. At the scaffold, I repeat, you\r\nwould cling to hope while one breath remained within you; wretch that\r\nyou are, you would dare to hope! you, who have denied all hope and mercy\r\nto so many unhappy beings! No, no! unless you repent, and that with all\r\nyour heart, for the misdeeds of your infamous life, I would (in this\r\nworld, at least) shut out from you the faintest glimmer of hope--"\r\n\r\n"What man is this? What have I ever done to injure _him_?--whence comes\r\nhe thus to torture me?--where am I?" asked the Schoolmaster, in almost\r\nincoherent tones, and nearly frantic with terror.\r\n\r\nRodolph continued:\r\n\r\n"If even you could meet death with a man\'s courage, I would not have you\r\nascend the scaffold; for you it would be merely the arena in which, like\r\nmany others, you would make a disgusting display of hardened ferocity;\r\nor, dying as you have lived, exhale your last sigh with an impious scoff\r\nor profane blasphemy. That must not be permitted. It is a bad example to\r\nset before a gazing crowd the spectacle of a condemned being making\r\nsport of the instrument of death, swaggering before the executioner, and\r\nyielding with an obscene jest the divine spark infused into man by the\r\nbreath of a creating God. To punish the body is easily done; to save the\r\nsoul is the great thing to be laboured for and desired. \'All sin may be\r\nforgiven,\' said our blessed Saviour, but from the tribunal to the\r\nscaffold the passage is too short,--time and opportunity are required to\r\nrepent and make atonement; this leisure you shall have. May God grant\r\nthat you turn it to the right purpose!"\r\n\r\nThe Schoolmaster remained utterly bewildered; for the first time in his\r\nlife a vague and confused dread of something more horrible far than\r\ndeath itself crossed his guilty mind,--he trembled before the\r\nsuggestions of his own imagination.\r\n\r\nRodolph went on:\r\n\r\n"Anselm Duresnel, I will not sentence you to the galleys, neither shall\r\nyou die--"\r\n\r\n"Then do you intend sending me to hell? or what are you going to do with\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"Listen!" said Rodolph, rising from his seat with an air of menacing\r\nauthority. "You have wickedly abused the great bodily strength bestowed\r\nupon you,--I will paralyse that strength; the strongest have trembled\r\nbefore you,--I will make you henceforward shrink in the presence of the\r\nweakest of beings. Assassin! murderer! you have plunged God\'s creatures\r\ninto eternal night; your darkness shall commence even in this life.\r\nNow--this very hour--your punishment shall be proportioned to your\r\ncrimes. But," added Rodolph, with an accent of mournful pity, "the\r\nterrible judgment I am about to pronounce will, at least, leave the\r\nfuture open to your efforts for pardon and for peace. I should be guilty\r\nas you are were I, in punishing you, to seek only for vengeance, just as\r\nis my right to demand it; far from being unrelenting as death, your\r\nsentence shall bring forth good fruits for hereafter; far from\r\ndestroying your soul, it shall help you to seek its salvation. If, to\r\nprevent you from further violating the commandments of your Maker, I for\r\never deprive you of the beauties of this outer world, if I plunge you\r\ninto impenetrable darkness, with no other companion than the remembrance\r\nof your crimes, it is that you may incessantly contemplate their\r\nenormity. Yes, separated for ever from this external world, your\r\nthoughts must needs revert to yourself, and your vision dwell internally\r\nupon the bygone scenes of your ill-spent life; and I am not without hope\r\nthat such a mental and constantly presented picture will send the blush\r\nof shame even upon your hardened features, that your soul, deadened as\r\nit now is to every good and holy impulse, will become softened and\r\ntender by repentance. Your language, too, will be changed, and good and\r\nprayerful words take place of those daring and blasphemous expressions\r\nwhich now disgrace your lips. You are brutal and overbearing, because\r\nyou are strong; you will become mild and gentle when you are deprived of\r\nthat strength. Now your heart scoffs at the very mention of repentance,\r\nbut the day will come when, bowed to the earth with deep contrition, you\r\nwill bewail your victims in dust and ashes. You have degraded the\r\nintelligence placed within you by a supreme power,--you have reduced it\r\nto the brutal instincts of rapine and murder; from a man formed after\r\nthe image of his Creator, you have made yourself a beast of prey: one\r\nday, as I trust and believe, that intelligence will be purified by\r\nremorse and rendered again guiltless through divine expiation. You, more\r\ninhuman than the beast which perisheth, have trampled on the tender\r\nfeelings by which even animals are actuated,--you have been the\r\ndestroyer of your partner and your offspring. After a long life,\r\nentirely devoted to the expiation of your crimes, you may venture to\r\nimplore of the Almighty the great though unmerited happiness of\r\nobtaining the pardon of your wife and son, and dying in their presence."\r\n\r\nAs Rodolph uttered these last words his voice trembled with emotion, and\r\nhe was obliged to conclude.\r\n\r\nThe Schoolmaster\'s terrors had, during this long discourse, entirely\r\nyielded to an opinion that he was only to be subjected to a long lecture\r\non morality, and so forth, and then discharged upon his own promise of\r\namendment; for the many mysterious words uttered by Rodolph he looked\r\nupon as mere vague expressions intended to alarm him,--nothing more.\r\nStill further reassured by the mild tone in which Rodolph had addressed\r\nhim, the ruffian assumed his usually insolent air and manner as he said,\r\nbursting into a loud and vulgar laugh:\r\n\r\n"Well done, upon my word! A very good sermon, and very well spoken! Only\r\nwe must recollect where we leave off in our moral catechism, that we may\r\nbegin all right next lesson day. Come, let us have something lively now.\r\nWhat do you say, master; will you guess a charade or two, just to\r\nenliven us a bit?"\r\n\r\nInstead of replying, Rodolph addressed the black doctor:\r\n\r\n"Proceed, David! And if I do wrong, may the Almighty punish me alone!"\r\n\r\nThe negro rang; two men entered. David pointed to a side door, which\r\nopened into an adjoining closet.\r\n\r\nThe chair in which the Schoolmaster remained bound, so as to be\r\nincapable of the smallest movement, was then rolled into the anteroom.\r\n\r\n"Are you going to murder me, then? Mercy! mercy!" shrieked the wretched\r\nman, as he was being removed.\r\n\r\n"Gag him!" cried the negro, entering the closet.\r\n\r\nRodolph and the Chourineur were left alone.\r\n\r\n"M. Rodolph," said the Chourineur, pale and trembling, "M. Rodolph, what\r\nis going to be done? I never felt so frightened. Pray speak; I must be\r\ndreaming, surely. What have they done to the Schoolmaster? He does not\r\ncry out,--all is so silent; it makes me more fearful still!"\r\n\r\nAt this moment David issued from the cabinet; his complexion had that\r\nlivid hue peculiar to the negro countenance, while his lips were ashy\r\npale.\r\n\r\nThe men who had conveyed the Schoolmaster into the closet now replaced\r\nhim, still bound in his chair, on the spot he had previously occupied in\r\nRodolph\'s presence.\r\n\r\n"Unbind him, and remove the gag!" exclaimed David.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of fearful silence while the two attendants relieved\r\nthe Schoolmaster of his gag and untied the cords which bound him to the\r\nchair. As the last ligature gave way, he sprang up, his hideous\r\ncountenance expressing rage, horror, and alarm. He advanced one step\r\nwith extended hands, then, falling back into the chair, he uttered a cry\r\nof unspeakable agony, and, raising his hands towards the ceiling,\r\nexclaimed, with maddened fury:\r\n\r\n"Blind, by heaven!"\r\n\r\n"Give him this pocketbook, David," said Rodolph.\r\n\r\nThe negro placed a small pocketbook in the trembling hands of the\r\nSchoolmaster.\r\n\r\n"You will find in that pocketbook wherewithal to provide yourself with\r\na home and the means of living for the remainder of your days. Go, seek\r\nout some safe and solitary dwelling, where, by humble repentance, you\r\nmay seek to propitiate an offended God! You are free! Go and repent; the\r\nLord is merciful, and his ears are ever open to such as truly repent."\r\n\r\n"Blind! quite blind!" repeated the Schoolmaster, mechanically grasping\r\nthe pocketbook.\r\n\r\n"Open the doors,--let him depart!" said Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"Blind! blind!" repeated the bewildered and discomfited ruffian.\r\n\r\n"You are free; you have the means of providing for yourself; begone!"\r\n\r\n"And whither am I to go?" exclaimed he, with the most unbounded rage.\r\n"You have taken away my sight; how, then, do I know in which direction\r\nto go? Call you not this a crime thus to abuse your power over one\r\nunhappily in your hands? Thus to--"\r\n\r\n"To abuse my power!" repeated Rodolph, in a solemn voice. "And how have\r\nyou employed the power granted to you? How used _your_ superior\r\nstrength?"\r\n\r\n"O Death! how gladly would I now accept you!" cried the wretched man.\r\n"To be henceforward at every one\'s mercy,--to fear the weakest, the\r\nsmallest object!--a child might now master me! Gracious God! what will\r\nbecome of me?"\r\n\r\n"You have plenty of money."\r\n\r\n"It will be taken from me!" cried the ruffian.\r\n\r\n"Mark those words,--\'It will be taken from me!\' See how they fill you\r\nwith fear and dread! You have plundered so many, unmindful of their\r\nhelpless, destitute condition,--begone!"\r\n\r\n"For the love of God," cried the Schoolmaster, in a suppliant tone, "let\r\nsome person lead me forth! What will become of me in the streets? Oh, in\r\nmercy kill me! take my miserable life! but do not turn me out thus\r\nwretched, thus helpless! Kill, for pity\'s sake, and save me from being\r\ncrushed beneath the first vehicle I encounter!"\r\n\r\n"No! Live and repent."\r\n\r\n"Repent!" shouted the Schoolmaster, in a fearful voice. "Never! I will\r\nlive for vengeance,--for deep and fearful vengeance!" And again he threw\r\nhimself from the chair, holding his clenched fists in a menacing\r\nattitude towards the ceiling, as though calling upon Heaven to witness\r\nthe fixedness of his resolve. In an instant his step faltered; he again\r\nhesitated, as though fearful of a thousand dangers.\r\n\r\n"Alas! alas! I cannot proceed,--I dare not move! And I, lately so strong\r\nand so dreaded by all,--look at me now! Yet no one pities me,--no one\r\ncares for me,--no hand is stretched out to help the wretched blind upon\r\nhis lonely way!"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to express the stupefaction and alarm expressed by the\r\ncountenance of the Chourineur during this terrible scene. His rough\r\nfeatures exhibited the deepest compassion for his fallen foe, and\r\napproaching Rodolph, he said, in a low tone:\r\n\r\n"M. Rodolph, he was an accomplished villain, and has only got what he\r\nrichly deserves; he wanted to murder me a little while ago, too. But he\r\nis now blind,--he does not even know how to find his way out of the\r\nhouse, and he may be crushed to death in the streets; may I lead him to\r\nsome safe place, where, at least, he may remain quiet for a time?"\r\n\r\n"Nobly said!" replied Rodolph, kindly pressing the hand of the\r\nChourineur. "Go, my worthy fellow! Go with him, by all means!"\r\n\r\nThe Chourineur approached the Schoolmaster and laid his hand on his\r\nshoulder; the miserable villain started.\r\n\r\n"Who touches me?" asked he, in a husky voice.\r\n\r\n"It is I."\r\n\r\n"I? Who? Who are you,--friend or foe?"\r\n\r\n"The Chourineur."\r\n\r\n"And you have come to avenge yourself now you find I am incapable of\r\nprotecting myself, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing of the sort. Here, take my arm; you cannot find the way out by\r\nyourself; let me lead you--there--"\r\n\r\n"You, Chourineur? You!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, for all you doubt it; but you vex me by not seeming to like my\r\nhelp. Come, hold tight by me; I will see you all right before I leave\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Are you quite sure you do not mean me some harm? that you are only\r\nlaying a trap to ensnare me?"\r\n\r\n"I am not such a scoundrel as to take advantage of your misfortune. But\r\nlet us begone. Come on, old fellow; it will be daylight directly."\r\n\r\n"Day! which I shall never more behold! Day and night to me are\r\nhenceforward all the same!" exclaimed the Schoolmaster, in such piteous\r\ntones that Rodolph, unable longer to endure this scene, abruptly\r\nretired, followed by David, who first dismissed his two assistants.\r\n\r\nThe Chourineur and the Schoolmaster remained alone. After a lengthened\r\nsilence the latter spoke first, by inquiring whether it were really true\r\nthat the pocketbook presented to him contained money.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I can positively speak to its containing five thousand francs,"\r\nreplied the Chourineur, "since I put them in it with my own hand. With\r\nthat sum you could easily place yourself to board with some quiet, good\r\nsort of people, who would look to you,--in some retired spot in the\r\ncountry, where you might pass your days happily. Or would you like me to\r\ntake you to the ogress\'s?"\r\n\r\n"She! she would not leave me a rap."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, will you go to Bras Rouge?"\r\n\r\n"No, no! He would poison me first and rob me afterwards."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, where shall I take you?"\r\n\r\n"I know not. Happily for both, you are no thief, Chourineur. Here, take\r\nmy pocketbook, and conceal it carefully in my waistcoat, that La\r\nChouette may not see it; she would plunder me of every sou."\r\n\r\n"Oh, bless you! the Chouette is quite safe just now; she lies in the\r\nHopital Beaujon. While I was struggling with you both to-night I\r\nhappened to dislocate her leg, so she\'s obliged to lie up for the\r\npresent."\r\n\r\n"But what, in heaven\'s name, shall I do with this black curtain\r\ncontinually before my eyes? In vain I try to push it away; it is still\r\nthere, fixed, immovable; and on its surface I see the pale, ghastly\r\nfeatures of those--"\r\n\r\nHe shuddered, and said in a low, hoarse voice, "Chourineur, did I quite\r\ndo for that man last night?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"So much the better," observed the robber. And then, after some minutes\'\r\nsilence, he exclaimed, under a fresh impulse of ungovernable fury, "And\r\nit is you I have to thank for all this! Rascal! scoundrel! I hate you!\r\nBut for you, I should have \'stiffened\' my man and walked off with his\r\nmoney. My very blindness I owe to you; my curses upon you for your\r\nmeddling interference! But through you I should have had my blessed eyes\r\nto see my own way with. How do I know what devil\'s trick you are\r\nplanning at this moment?"\r\n\r\n"Try to forget all that is past,--it can\'t be helped now; and do not put\r\nyourself in such a terrible way,--it is really very bad for you. Come,\r\ncome along--now, no nonsense--will you? yes or no?--because I am\r\nregularly done up, and must get a short snooze somewhere. I can tell you\r\nI have had a bellyful of such doings, and to-morrow I shall get back to\r\nmy timber-pile, and earn an honest dinner before I eat it. I am only\r\nwaiting to take you wherever you decide upon going, and then on goes my\r\nnightcap and I goes to sleep."\r\n\r\n"But how can I tell you where to take me, when I do not know myself? My\r\nlodging--No, no, that will not do; I should be obliged to tell--"\r\n\r\n"Well, then, hark ye. Will you, for a day or two, make shift with my\r\ncrib? I may meet with some decent sort of people, who, not knowing who\r\nyou really are, would receive you as a boarder; and we might say you\r\nwere a confirmed invalid, and required great care and perfect\r\nretirement. Now I think of it, there is a person of my acquaintance,\r\nliving at Port St. Nicolas, has a mother, a very worthy woman, but in\r\nhumble circumstances, residing at St. Mande: very likely she would be\r\nglad to take charge of you. What do you say,--will you come or not?"\r\n\r\n"One may trust you, Chourineur. I am not at all fearful of going, money\r\nand all, to your place; happily you have kept yourself honest, amidst\r\nall the evil example others have set you."\r\n\r\n"Ay, and even bore the taunts and jests you used to heap upon me,\r\nbecause I would not turn prig like yourself."\r\n\r\n"Alas! who could foresee?"\r\n\r\n"Now, you see, if I had listened to you, instead of trying to be of real\r\nservice to you, I should clean you out of all your cash."\r\n\r\n"True, true. But you are a downright good fellow, and have neither\r\nmalice nor hatred in your heart," said the unhappy Schoolmaster, in a\r\ntone of deep dejection and humility. "You are a vast deal better to me\r\nthan, I fear, I should have been to you under the same circumstances."\r\n\r\n"I believe you, too. Why, M. Rodolph himself told me I had both heart\r\nand honour."\r\n\r\n"But who the devil is this M. Rodolph?" exclaimed the Schoolmaster,\r\nbreaking out fresh at the mention of his name. "He is not a man; he is a\r\nmonster,--a fiend,--a--"\r\n\r\n"Hold, hold!" cried the Chourineur. "Now you are going to have another\r\nfit, which is bad for you and very disagreeable to me, because it makes\r\nyou abuse my friends. Come, are you ready? Shall we set forth on our\r\njourney?"\r\n\r\n"We are going to your lodging, are we not, Chourineur?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, if you are agreeable."\r\n\r\n"And you swear to me that you bear me no ill-will for the events of the\r\nlast twelve hours?"\r\n\r\n"Swear it? Of course I swear it. Why, I have no ill-will against you nor\r\nanybody."\r\n\r\n"And you are certain that he (the man, I mean) is not dead?"\r\n\r\n"I am as sure of it as that I am living myself."\r\n\r\n"That will at least give me one crime the less to answer for. If they\r\nonly knew--And that little old man of the Rue du Roule--and that woman\r\nof the Canal St. Martin--But it is useless thinking of all those things\r\nnow; I have enough to occupy my thoughts without trying to recall past\r\nmisfortunes. Blind! blind!" repeated the miserable wretch, as, leaning\r\non the arm of the Chourineur, he slowly took his departure from the\r\nhouse in the Allee des Veuves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ISLE-ADAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nA month has elapsed since the occurrence of the events we have just\r\nnarrated. We now conduct the reader into the little town of the\r\nIsle-Adam, situated in a delightful locality on the banks of the Oise,\r\nand at the foot of a forest.\r\n\r\nThe least things become great events in the country; and so the idlers\r\nof Isle-Adam, who were on the morning before us walking in the square\r\nbefore the church, were very anxiously bestirring themselves to learn\r\nwhen the individual would arrive who had recently become the purchaser\r\nof the most eligible premises for a butcher in that town, and which were\r\nexactly opposite to the church.\r\n\r\nOne of those idlers, more inquisitive than his companions, went and\r\nasked the butcher-boy, who, with a merry face and active hands, was very\r\nbusy in completing the arrangements of the shop. This lad replied that\r\nhe did not know who was the new proprietor, for he had bought the\r\nproperty through an agent. At this moment two persons, who had come from\r\nParis in a cabriolet, alighted at the door of the shop.\r\n\r\nThe one was Murphy, quite cured of his wound, and the other the\r\nChourineur. At the risk of repeating a vulgar saying, we will assert\r\nthat the impression produced by dress is so powerful, that the guest of\r\nthe "cribs" of the Cite was hardly to be recognised in his present\r\nattire. His countenance had undergone the same change; he had put off,\r\nwith his rags, his savage, coarse, and vulgar air; and to see him walk\r\nwith both his hands in the pockets of his long and warm coat of dark\r\nbroadcloth, he might have been taken for one of the most inoffensive\r\ncitizens in the world.\r\n\r\n"\'Faith, my fine fellow, the way was long and the cold excessive; were\r\nthey not?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I really did not perceive it, M. Murphy; I am too happy, and joy\r\nkeeps one warm. Besides, when I say happy, why--"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Yesterday you came to seek for me at the Port St. Nicolas, where I was\r\nunloading as hard as I could to keep myself warm. I had not seen you\r\nsince the night when the white-haired negro had put out the\r\nSchoolmaster\'s eyes. By Jove! it quite shook me, that affair did. And M.\r\nRodolph, what a countenance!--he who looked so mild and gentle! I was\r\nquite frightened at that moment; I was, indeed--"\r\n\r\n"Well, what then?"\r\n\r\n"You said to me, \'Good day, Chourineur.\' \'Good day, M. Murphy,\' says I.\r\n\'What, you are up again, I see! So much the better,--so much the better.\r\nAnd M. Rodolph?\' \'He was obliged to leave Paris some days after the\r\naffair of the Allee des Veuves, and he forgot you, my man.\' \'Well, M.\r\nMurphy, I can only say that if M. Rodolph has forgotten me, why--I shall\r\nbe very sorry for it, that\'s all.\' \'I meant to say, my good fellow, that\r\nhe had forgotten to recompense your services, but that he should always\r\nremember them.\' So, M. Murphy, those words cheered me up again directly.\r\n_Tonnerre!_ I--I shall never forget him. He told me I had heart and\r\nhonour,--that\'s enough."\r\n\r\n"Unfortunately, my lad, monseigneur left without giving any orders about\r\nyou. I have nothing but what monseigneur gives me, and I am unable to\r\nrepay as I could wish all that I owe you personally."\r\n\r\n"Come, come, M. Murphy, you are jesting with me."\r\n\r\n"But why the devil did you not come back again to the Allee des Veuves\r\nafter that fatal night? Then monseigneur would not have left without\r\nthinking of you."\r\n\r\n"Why, M. Rodolph did not tell me to do so, and I thought that perhaps he\r\nhad no further occasion for me."\r\n\r\n"But you might have supposed that he would, at least, desire to express\r\nhis gratitude to you."\r\n\r\n"Did you not tell me that M. Rodolph has not forgotten me, M. Murphy?"\r\n\r\n"Well, well, don\'t let us say another word about it; only I have had a\r\ngreat deal of trouble to find you out. You do not now go to the\r\nogress\'s?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, from some foolish notions I have had."\r\n\r\n"Very well. But to return to what you were telling me--"\r\n\r\n"To what, M. Murphy?"\r\n\r\n"You told me, I am glad I have found you, and still happy, perhaps--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, M. Murphy! Why, you see, when you came to where I was at work\r\nat the timber-yard, you said, \'My lad, I am not rich, but I can procure\r\nyou a situation where your work will be easier than on the Quai, and\r\nwhere you will gain four francs a day.\' Four francs a day! Vive la\r\nCharte! I could not believe it; \'twas the pay of an adjutant\r\nsub-officer! I replied, \'That\'s the very thing for me, M. Murphy!\' but\r\nyou said then that I must not look so like a beggar, as that would\r\nfrighten the employer to whom you would take me. I answered, \'I have not\r\nthe means of dressing otherwise.\' You said to me, \'Come to the Temple.\'\r\nI followed you. I chose the most spicy attire that Mother Hubart\r\nhad,--you advanced me the money to pay her,--and in a quarter of an hour\r\nI was as smart as a landlord or a dentist. You appointed me to meet you\r\nthis morning at the Porte St. Denis, at daybreak; I found you there in a\r\ncab, and here we are."\r\n\r\n"Well, do you find anything to regret in all this?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I\'ll tell you, M. Murphy. You see, to be dressed in this way\r\nspoils a fellow; and so, you see, when I put on again my old smock-frock\r\nand trousers, I sha\'n\'t like it. And then, to gain four francs a\r\nday,--I, who never earned but two,--and that all at once! why, I seem to\r\nhave made too great a start all of a sudden, and that it cannot last. I\r\nwould rather sleep all my life on the wretched straw bed in my\r\ncock-loft, than sleep five or six nights only in a good bed. That\'s my\r\nview of the thing."\r\n\r\n"And you are by no means peculiar in your view; but the best thing is to\r\nsleep always in a good bed."\r\n\r\n"And no mistake; it is better to have a bellyful of victuals every day\r\nthan to starve with hunger. Ah! here is a butchery here," said the\r\nChourineur, as he listened to the blows of the chopper which the boy was\r\nusing, and observed the quarters of beef through the curtains.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my lad; it belongs to a friend of mine. Would you like to see it\r\nwhilst the horse just recovers his wind?"\r\n\r\n"I really should, for it reminds me of my boyish days, if it was only\r\nwhen I had Montfaucon for a slaughter-house and broken-down horses for\r\ncattle. It is droll, but if I had the means, a butcher\'s is the trade in\r\nwhich I should set up, for I like it. To go on a good nag to buy cattle\r\nat fairs,--to return home to one\'s own fireside, to warm yourself if\r\ncold, or dry yourself if wet,--to find your housekeeper, or a good,\r\njolly, plump wife, cheerful and pleasant, with a parcel of children to\r\nfeel in your pockets to see if you have brought them home anything! And\r\nthen, in the morning, in the slaughter-house, to seize an ox by the\r\nhorns, particularly when he\'s fierce,--_nom de nom!_ he must be\r\nfierce!--then to put on the ring, to cleave him down, cut him up, dress\r\nhim,--_Tonnerre!_ that would have been my ambition, as it was the\r\nGoualeuse\'s to suck barley-sugar when she was a little \'un. By the way,\r\nthat poor girl, M. Murphy,--not seeing her any more at the ogress\'s, I\r\nsupposed that M. Rodolph had taken her away from there. That\'s a good\r\naction, M. Murphy. Poor child! she never liked to do wrong,--she was so\r\nyoung! And then the habit! Ah, M. Rodolph has behaved quite right!"\r\n\r\n"I am of your opinion. But will you come into the shop until our horse\r\nhas rested awhile?"\r\n\r\nThe Chourineur and Murphy entered the shop, and then went to see the\r\nyard, where three splendid oxen and a score of sheep were fastened up;\r\nthey then visited the stable, the chaise-house, the slaughter-house, the\r\nlofts, and the out-buildings of the house, which were all in excellent\r\norder, and kept with a cleanliness and care which bespoke regularity and\r\neasy circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhen they had seen all but the up-stairs, Murphy said:\r\n\r\n"You must own that my friend is a lucky fellow. This house and property\r\nare his, without counting a thousand crowns in hand to carry on his\r\nbusiness with; and he is, besides, only thirty-eight, strong as a bull,\r\nwith an iron constitution, and very fond of his business. The\r\nindustrious and civil journeyman that you saw in the shop supplies his\r\nplace, with much capability, when he goes to the fairs to purchase\r\ncattle. I say again, is he not a lucky fellow?"\r\n\r\n"He is, indeed, M. Murphy. But, you see, there are lucky and unlucky\r\npeople; and when I think that I am going to gain four francs a day, and\r\nknow how many there are who only earn the half, or even less--"\r\n\r\n"Will you come up and see the rest of the house?"\r\n\r\n"With all my heart, M. Murphy."\r\n\r\n"The person who is about to employ you is up-stairs."\r\n\r\n"The person who is going to employ me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Why, then, didn\'t you tell me that before?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you--"\r\n\r\n"One moment," said the Chourineur, with a downcast and embarrassed air,\r\ntaking Murphy by the arm; "listen whilst I say a word to you, which\r\nperhaps M. Rodolph did not tell you, but which I ought not to conceal\r\nfrom the master who employs me, because, if he is offended by it--why\r\nthen, you see--why, afterwards--"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean to say?"\r\n\r\n"I mean to say--"\r\n\r\n"Well, what?"\r\n\r\n"That I am a convict, who has served his time,--that I have been at the\r\nBagne," said Chourineur, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" replied Murphy.\r\n\r\n"But I never did wrong to any one," exclaimed the Chourineur; "and I\r\nwould sooner die of hunger than rob; but I have done worse than rob," he\r\nadded, bending his head down; "I have killed my fellow creature in a\r\npassion. But that is not all," he continued, after a moment\'s pause. "I\r\nwill tell everything to my employer; I would rather be refused at first\r\nthan detected afterwards. You know him, and if you think he would refuse\r\nme, why, spare me the refusal, and I will go as I came."\r\n\r\n"Come along with me," said Murphy.\r\n\r\nThe Chourineur followed Murphy up the staircase; a door opened, and they\r\nwere both in the presence of Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"My good Murphy," said he, "leave us together awhile."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nRECOMPENSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Vive la Charte!" cried the Chourineur. "How precious glad I am to see\r\nyou again, M. Rodolph--or, rather, my lord!"\r\n\r\n"Good day, my excellent friend. I am equally glad to see you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, what a joker M. Murphy is! He told me you had gone away. But stay,\r\nmy lord--"\r\n\r\n"Call me M. Rodolph; I like that best."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, M. Rodolph, I have to ask your pardon for not having been\r\nto see you after the night with the Schoolmaster. I see now that I was\r\nguilty of a great rudeness; but I do not suppose that you had any desire\r\nto see me?"\r\n\r\n"I forgive you," said Rodolph, smiling; and then added, "Murphy has\r\nshown you all over the house?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, M. Rodolph; and a fine house and fine shop it is,--all so neat and\r\nso comfortable! Talking of comfortable, I am the man that will be so, M.\r\nRodolph! M. Murphy is going to put me in the way of earning four francs\r\na day,--yes, four francs a day!"\r\n\r\n"I have something better than that to propose to you, my good fellow."\r\n\r\n"Better! It\'s unpolite to contradict you, but I think that would be\r\ndifficult. Four francs a day!"\r\n\r\n"I tell you I have something better: for this house, all that it\r\ncontains, the shop, and a thousand crowns which are in this\r\npocketbook,--all are yours."\r\n\r\nThe Chourineur smiled with a stupid air, flattened his long-napped hat\r\nbetween his knees, and squeezed it convulsively, evidently not\r\nunderstanding what Rodolph said to him, although his language was plain\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nRodolph, with much kindness, said to him:\r\n\r\n"I can imagine your surprise; but I again repeat, this house and this\r\nmoney are yours,--they are your property."\r\n\r\nThe Chourineur became purple, passed his horny hand over his brow, which\r\nwas bathed with perspiration, and stammered out, in a faltering voice:\r\n\r\n"What!--eh!--that is--indeed--my property!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, your property; for I bestow it all upon you. Do you understand? I\r\ngive it to you."\r\n\r\nThe Chourineur rocked backwards and forwards on his chair, scratched his\r\nhead, coughed, looked down on the ground, and made no reply. He felt\r\nthat the thread of his ideas had escaped him. He heard quite well what\r\nRodolph said to him, and that was the very reason he could not credit\r\nwhat he heard. Between the depth of misery, the degradation in which he\r\nhad always existed, and the position in which Rodolph now placed him,\r\nthere was an abyss so wide that the service he had rendered to Rodolph,\r\nimportant as it was, could not fill it up.\r\n\r\n"Does what I give you, then, seem beyond your hopes?" inquired Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"My lord," said the Chourineur, starting up suddenly, "you offer me this\r\nhouse and a great deal of money,--to tempt me; but I cannot take them; I\r\nnever robbed in my life. It is, perhaps, to kill; but I have too often\r\ndreamed of the sergeant," added he, in a hoarse tone.\r\n\r\n"Oh, the unfortunate!" exclaimed Rodolph, with bitterness. "The\r\ncompassion evinced for them is so rare, that they can only explain\r\nliberality as a temptation to crime!"\r\n\r\nThen addressing the Chourineur, in a voice full of gentleness:\r\n\r\n"You judge me wrong,--you mistake: I shall require from you nothing but\r\nwhat is honourable. What I give you, I give because you have deserved\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"I," said the Chourineur, whose embarrassments recommenced, "I deserve\r\nit! How?"\r\n\r\n"I will tell you. Abandoned from your infancy, without any knowledge of\r\nright or wrong, left to your natural instinct, shut up for fifteen years\r\nin the Bagne with the most desperate villains, assailed by want and\r\nwretchedness, compelled by your own disgrace, and the opinion of honest\r\nmen, to continue to haunt the low dens infested by the vilest\r\nmalefactors, you have not only remained honest, but remorse for your\r\ncrime has outlived the expiation which human justice had inflicted upon\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nThis simple and noble language was a new source of astonishment for the\r\nChourineur; he contemplated Rodolph with respect, mingled with fear and\r\ngratitude, but was still unable to convince himself that all he heard\r\nwas reality.\r\n\r\n"What, M. Rodolph, because you beat me, because, thinking you a workman,\r\nlike myself, because you spoke \'slang\' as if you had learned it from the\r\ncradle, I told you my history over two bottles of wine, and afterwards I\r\nsaved you from being drowned,--you give me a house--money--I shall be\r\nmaster! Say really, M. Rodolph, once more, is it possible?"\r\n\r\n"Believing me like yourself, you told me your history naturally and\r\nwithout concealment, without withholding either what was culpable or\r\ngenerous. I have judged you, and judged you well, and I have resolved to\r\nrecompense you."\r\n\r\n"But, M. Rodolph, it ought not to be; there are poor labourers who have\r\nbeen honest all their lives, and who--"\r\n\r\n"I know it, and it may be I have done for many others more than I am\r\ndoing for you; but, if the man who lives honestly in the midst of\r\nhonest men, encouraged by their esteem, deserves assistance and support,\r\nhe who, in spite of the aversion of good men, remains honest amidst the\r\nmost infamous associates on earth,--he, too, deserves assistance and\r\nsupport. This is not all; you saved my life, you saved the life of\r\nMurphy, the dearest friend I have; and what I do for you is as much the\r\ndictate of personal gratitude as it is the desire to withdraw from\r\npollution a good and generous nature, which has been perverted, but not\r\ndestroyed. And that is not all."\r\n\r\n"What else have I done, M. Rodolph?"\r\n\r\nRodolph took his hand, and, shaking it heartily, said:\r\n\r\n"Filled with commiseration for the mischief which had befallen the very\r\nman who had tried just before to kill you, you even gave him an asylum\r\nin your humble dwelling,--No. 9, close to Notre Dame."\r\n\r\n"You knew, then, where I lived, M. Rodolph?"\r\n\r\n"If you forget the services you have done to me, I do not. When you left\r\nmy house you were followed, and were seen to enter there with the\r\nSchoolmaster."\r\n\r\n"But M. Murphy told me that you did not know where I lived, M. Rodolph."\r\n\r\n"I was desirous of trying you still further; I wished to know if you had\r\ndisinterestedness in your generosity, and I found that, after your\r\ncourageous conduct, you returned to your hard daily labour, asking\r\nnothing, hoping for nothing, not even uttering a word of reproach for\r\nthe apparent ingratitude with which I repaid your services; and when\r\nMurphy yesterday proposed to you employment a little more profitable\r\nthan that of your habitual toil, you accepted it with joy, with\r\ngratitude."\r\n\r\n"Why, M. Rodolph, do you see, sir, four francs a day are always four\r\nfrancs a day. As to the service I rendered you, why, it is rather I who\r\nought to thank you."\r\n\r\n"How so?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, M. Rodolph," he added, with a saddened air, "I do not forget\r\nthat, since I knew you, it was you who said to me those two words,\'You\r\nhave both heart and honour!\' It is astonishing how I have thought of\r\nthat. They are only two little words, and yet those two words had that\r\neffect. But, in truth, sow two small grains of anything in the soil, and\r\nthey will put forth shoots."\r\n\r\nThis comparison, just and almost poetical as it was, struck Rodolph. In\r\nsooth, two words, but two magic words for the heart that understood\r\nthem, had almost suddenly developed the generous instincts which were\r\ninherent in this energetic nature.\r\n\r\n"You placed the Schoolmaster at St. Mande?" said Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"Yes, M. Rodolph. He made me change his notes for gold, and buy a belt,\r\nwhich I sewed round his body, and in which I put his \'mopuses;\' and\r\nthen, good day! He boards for thirty sous a day with good people, to\r\nwhom that sum is of much service. When I have time to leave my\r\nwood-piles, I shall go and see how he gets on."\r\n\r\n"Your wood-piles! You forget your shop, and that you are here at home!"\r\n\r\n"Come, M. Rodolph, do not amuse yourself by jesting with a poor devil\r\nlike me; you have had your fun in \'proving\' me, as you term it. My house\r\nand my shop are songs to the same tune. You said to yourself,\'Let us see\r\nif this Chourineur is such a gulpin as to believe that I will make him\r\nsuch a present.\' Enough, enough, M. Rodolph; you are a wag, and there\'s\r\nan end of the matter."\r\n\r\nAnd he laughed long, loud, and heartily.\r\n\r\n"But, once more, believe--"\r\n\r\n"If I were to believe you, then you would say, \'Poor Chourineur! go! you\r\nare a trouble to me now.\'"\r\n\r\nRodolph began to be really troubled how to convince the Chourineur, and\r\nsaid in a solemn, impressive, and almost severe tone:\r\n\r\n"I never make sport of the gratitude and sympathy with which noble\r\nconduct inspires me. I have said this house and this establishment are\r\nyours, if they suit you, for the bargain is conditional. I swear to you,\r\non my honour, all this belongs to you; and I make you a present of it,\r\nfor the reasons I have already given."\r\n\r\nThe dignified and firm tone, and the serious expression of the features\r\nof Rodolph, at length convinced the Chourineur. For some moments he\r\nlooked at his protector in silence, and then said, in a voice of deep\r\nemotion:\r\n\r\n"I believe you, my lord, and I thank you much. A poor man like me cannot\r\nmake fine speeches, but once more, indeed, on my word, I thank you very\r\nmuch. All I can say is, that I will never refuse assistance to the\r\nunhappy; because Hunger and Misery are ogresses of the same sort as\r\nthose who laid hands on the poor Goualeuse; and, once in that sink, it\r\nis not every one that has the fist strong enough to pull you out again."\r\n\r\n"My worthy fellow, you cannot prove your gratitude more than in speaking\r\nto me thus."\r\n\r\n"So much the better, my lord; for else I should have a hard job to prove\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Come, now, let us visit your house; my good old Murphy has had the\r\npleasure, and I should like it also."\r\n\r\nRodolph and the Chourineur came down-stairs. At the moment they reached\r\nthe yard, the shopman, addressing the Chourineur, said to him,\r\nrespectfully:\r\n\r\n"Since you, sir, are to be my master, I beg to tell you that our custom\r\nis capital. We have no more cutlets or legs of mutton left, and we must\r\nkill a sheep or two directly."\r\n\r\n"_Parbleu!_" said Rodolph to the Chourineur; "here is a capital\r\nopportunity for exercising your skill. I should like to have the first\r\nsample,--the open air has given me an appetite, and I will taste your\r\ncutlets."\r\n\r\n"You are very kind, M. Rodolph," said the Chourineur, in a cheerful\r\nvoice; "you flatter me, but I will do my best."\r\n\r\n"Shall I bring two sheep to the slaughter-house, master?" asked the\r\njourneyman.\r\n\r\n"Yes; and bring a well-sharpened knife, not too thin in the blade, and\r\nstrong in the back."\r\n\r\n"I have just what you want, master. There, you could shave with it. Take\r\nit--"\r\n\r\n"_Tonnerre_, M. Rodolph!" said the Chourineur, taking off his upper coat\r\nwith haste, and turning up his shirtsleeves, which displayed a pair of\r\narms like a prize-fighter\'s; "this reminds me of my boyish days and the\r\nslaughter-house. You shall see how I handle a knife! _Nom de nom!_ I\r\nwish I was at it. The knife, lad! the knife! That\'s it; I see you know\r\nyour trade. This is a blade! Who will have it? _Tonnerre!_ with a tool\r\nlike this I could face a wild bull."\r\n\r\nAnd the Chourineur brandished his knife,--his eyes began to fill with\r\nblood; the beast was regaining the mastery; the instinct and thirst for\r\nblood reappeared in all the fullness of their fearful predominance.\r\n\r\nThe butchery was in the yard,--a vaulted, dark place, paved with stones,\r\nand lighted by a small, narrow opening at the top.\r\n\r\nThe man drove one of the sheep to the door.\r\n\r\n"Shall I fasten him to the ring, master?"\r\n\r\n"Fasten him! _Tonnerre!_ and I with my knees at liberty? Oh, no; I will\r\nhold him here as fast as if in a vice. Give me the beast, and go back to\r\nthe shop."\r\n\r\nThe journeyman obeyed. Rodolph was left alone with the Chourineur, and\r\nwatched him attentively, almost anxiously.\r\n\r\n"Now, then, to work!" said he.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I sha\'n\'t be long. _Tonnerre!_ you shall see how I handle a knife!\r\nMy hands burn, and I have a singing in my ears; my temples beat, as they\r\nused when I was going to \'see red.\' Come here, thou--Ah, _Madelon!_ let\r\nme stab you dead!"\r\n\r\nThen his eyes sparkled with a fierce delight, and, no longer conscious\r\nof the presence of Rodolph, the Chourineur lifted the sheep without an\r\neffort; with one spring he carried it off as a wolf would do, bounding\r\ntowards his lair with his prey.\r\n\r\nRodolph followed him, and leaned on one of the wings of the door, which\r\nhe closed. The butchery was dark; one strong ray of light, falling\r\nstraight down, lighted up, _a la Rembrandt_, the rugged features of the\r\nChourineur, his light hair, and his red whiskers. Stooping low, holding\r\nin his teeth a long knife, which glittered in the "darkness visible," he\r\ndrew the sheep between his legs, and, when he had adjusted it, took it\r\nby the head, stretched out its neck, and cut its throat.\r\n\r\nAt the instant when the sheep felt the keen blade, it gave one gentle,\r\nlow, and pitiful bleat, and, raising its dying eyes to the Chourineur,\r\ntwo spurts of blood jetted forth into the face of its slayer. The cry,\r\nthe look, the blood that spouted out, made a fearful impression on the\r\nman. His knife fell from his hands; his features grew livid, contracted,\r\nand horrible, beneath the blood that covered them; his eyes expanded,\r\nhis hair stiffened; and then retreating, with a gesture of horror, he\r\ncried, in a suffocating voice, "Oh, the sergeant! the sergeant!"\r\n\r\nRodolph hastened to him: "Recover yourself, my good fellow!"\r\n\r\n"There! there! the sergeant!" repeated the Chourineur, retreating step\r\nby step, with his eyes fixed and haggard, and pointing with his finger\r\nas if at some invisible phantom. Then uttering a fearful cry, as if the\r\nspectre had touched him, he rushed to the bottom of the butchery, into\r\nthe darkest corner; and there, with his face, breast, and arms against\r\nthe wall, as if he would break through it to escape from so horrible a\r\nvision, he repeated, in a hollow and convulsive tone, "Oh, the sergeant!\r\nthe sergeant! the sergeant!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTHE DEPARTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to the care of Murphy and Rodolph, who with difficulty calmed his\r\nagitation, the Chourineur was completely restored to himself, and was\r\nalone with the prince in one of the rooms on the first floor in the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n"My lord," said he, despondingly, "you have been very kind, indeed, to\r\nme; but, hear me: I would rather be a thousand times more wretched than\r\nI have yet been than become a butcher."\r\n\r\n"Yet reflect a little."\r\n\r\n"Why, my lord, when I heard the cry of the poor animal which could not\r\nmake the slightest resistance; when I felt its blood spring into my\r\nface,--hot blood, which seemed as coming from a living thing; you cannot\r\nimagine what I felt; then I had my dream all over again,--the sergeant\r\nand those poor young fellows whom I cut and stabbed, who made no\r\ndefence, and died giving me a look so gentle, so gentle that they seemed\r\nas if they pitied me! My lord, it would drive me mad!"\r\n\r\nAnd the poor fellow hid his face in his hands with a convulsive start.\r\n\r\n"Come, come, calm yourself."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, my lord; but just now the sight of blood--of a knife--I\r\ncould not bear; at every instant it would renew those dreams which I was\r\nbeginning to forget. To have every day my hands and feet in blood, to\r\ncut the throats of poor animals who do not so much as make a\r\nstruggle--oh, no, no! I could not for the world. I would rather lose my\r\neyesight at once, like the Schoolmaster, than be compelled to follow\r\nsuch a business."\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to depict the energetic gesture, action, and\r\ncountenance of the Chourineur, as he thus expressed himself. Rodolph was\r\ndeeply affected by it, and satisfied with the horrible effect which the\r\nsight of the blood had caused to his protege.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the savage feeling, the bloodthirsty instinct, had overcome\r\nthe human being in the Chourineur; but remorse eventually overwhelmed\r\nthe instinct. That was as it should be, and it was a fine lesson.\r\n\r\n"Forgive me, my lord," said the Chourineur, in a faltering voice; "I\r\nmake but a bad recompense for all your kindness to me, but--"\r\n\r\n"Not at all, my good fellow; I told you that our bargain was\r\nconditional. I selected for you the business of a butcher, because your\r\ninclinations and taste seemed to lie in that direction--"\r\n\r\n"Alas! my lord, that\'s true; and, had it not been for what you know of,\r\nthat would have been the trade of all others I should have chosen. I was\r\nonly saying so to M. Murphy a little while since."\r\n\r\n"As it was just possible that your taste did not lie that way, I have\r\nthought of another arrangement for you. A person who has a large tract\r\nof property at Algiers will give me up, for you, one of the extensive\r\nfarms he holds in that country. The lands belonging to it are very\r\nfertile, and in full bearing; but I will not conceal from you, this\r\nestate is situated on the boundaries of the Atlas mountains,--that is,\r\nnear the outposts, and exposed to the frequent attacks of the Arabs, and\r\none must be as much of a soldier as a husbandman: it is, at the same\r\ntime, a redoubt and a farm. The man who occupies this dwelling in the\r\nabsence of the proprietor will explain everything to you; they say he is\r\nhonest and faithful, and you may retain him there as long as you like.\r\nOnce established there, you will not only increase your means by your\r\nlabour and ability, but render a real service to your country by your\r\ncourage. The colonists have formed a militia, and the extent of your\r\nproperty, the number of your tenants who will depend on you, will make\r\nyou the chief of a very considerable troop. Headed by your courage, this\r\nband may be extremely useful in protecting the properties which are\r\nthroughout the plain. I repeat to you, that this prospect for you would\r\nplease me very much, in spite of, or, rather, in consequence of the\r\ndanger; because you could at the same time display your natural\r\nintrepidity; and because, having thus expiated, and, as I may say,\r\nransomed yourself from a great crime, your restitution to society would\r\nbe more noble, more complete, more heroic, if it were worked out, in the\r\nmidst of perils in an unconquered clime, than in the midst of the quiet\r\ninhabitants of a little town. If I did not first offer you this, it was\r\nbecause it was probable that the other would suit you, and the latter is\r\nso hazardous that I would not expose you to it without giving you the\r\nchoice. There is still time, and, if this proposition for Algiers does\r\nnot suit you, tell me so frankly, and we will look out for something\r\nelse; if not, to-morrow everything shall be signed, and you will start\r\nfor Algiers with a person commissioned by the former proprietor of the\r\nfarm to put you in full possession. Two years\' rent will be due, and\r\npaid to you on your arrival. The land yields three thousand francs a\r\nyear: work, improve it, be active, vigilant, and you will soon increase\r\nyour comfort and the security of the colonists, whom you will aid and\r\nassist I am sure, for you will always be charitable and generous; and\r\nremember, too, to be rich implies that we should give much away.\r\nAlthough separated from you, I shall not lose sight of you, and never\r\nforget that I and my best friend owe our lives to you. The only proof of\r\nattachment and gratitude I ask, is to learn to write and read as quickly\r\nas you can, that you may inform me regularly, once a week, what you do,\r\nand to address yourself to me direct if you need any advice or\r\nassistance."\r\n\r\nIt is useless to describe the extreme delight of the Chourineur. His\r\ndisposition, his instincts, are already sufficiently known to the\r\nreader, so that he may understand that no proposal could have been made\r\nmore acceptable to him.\r\n\r\nNext day all was arranged, and the Chourineur set out for Algiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nRESEARCHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe house which Rodolph had in the Allee des Veuves was not his usual\r\nplace of residence; he lived in one of the largest mansions in the\r\nFaubourg St. Germain, situated at the end of the Rue Plumet and the\r\nBoulevard des Invalides.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the honours due to his sovereign rank, the prince had preserved\r\nhis incognito since his arrival in Paris, his _charge d\'affaires_ at the\r\ncourt of France having announced that his master would pay his official\r\nand indispensable visits under the name and title of the Count de Duren.\r\nThanks to this usage (a very common one in the Northern courts), a\r\nprince may travel with as much liberty as pleasure, and escape all the\r\nbore of ceremonious introductions. In spite of his slight incognito,\r\nRodolph kept up in his mansion full state and etiquette. We will\r\nintroduce the reader into the hotel of the Rue Plumet, the day after the\r\nChourineur had started for Algiers.\r\n\r\nThe clock had just struck ten, A.M. In the middle of a large salon on\r\nthe ground floor and which formed the antechamber to Rodolph\'s business\r\nchamber, Murphy was seated before a bureau, and sealing several\r\ndespatches. A groom of the chambers, dressed in black and wearing a\r\nsilver chain around his neck, opened the folding-doors and announced:\r\n\r\n"His Excellency M. le Baron de Grauen."\r\n\r\nMurphy, without ceasing from his employment, received the baron with a\r\nnod at once cordial and familiar.\r\n\r\n"M. le Charge d\'Affaires," said he, smiling, "will you warm yourself at\r\nthe fire? I will be at your service in one moment."\r\n\r\n"M. the Private Secretary, I await your leisure," replied M. de Grauen,\r\ngaily, and making, with mock respect, a low and respectful bow to the\r\nworthy squire.\r\n\r\nThe baron was about fifty years of age, with hair gray, thin, and\r\nlightly curled and powdered. His chin, rather projecting, was partly\r\nconcealed in a high cravat of white muslin, starched very stiffly, and\r\nof unimpeachable whiteness. His countenance was expressive of great\r\nintelligence, and his carriage was _distingue_; whilst beneath his gold\r\nspectacles there beamed an eye as shrewd as it was penetrating. Although\r\nit was only ten o\'clock in the morning, M. de Grauen wore a black\r\ncoat,--that was etiquette,--and a riband, shot with several bright\r\ncolours, was suspended from his buttonhole. He placed his hat on a chair\r\nand took his station near the fireplace, whilst Murphy continued his\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n"His royal highness, no doubt, was up the best part of the night, my\r\ndear Murphy, for your correspondence appears considerable?"\r\n\r\n"Monseigneur went to bed at six o\'clock this morning. He wrote, amongst\r\nother letters, one of eight pages to the Grand Marshal, and dictated to\r\nme one equally long to the Chief of the Upper Council, the Prince\r\nHerkhauesen-Oldenzaal, his royal highness\'s cousin."\r\n\r\n"You know that his son, Prince Henry, has entered as lieutenant in the\r\nguards in the service of his Majesty the Emperor of Austria?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; monseigneur recommended him most warmly as his relation; and he\r\nreally is a fine, excellent young man, handsome as an angel, and as good\r\nas gold."\r\n\r\n"The fact is, my dear Murphy, that if the young Prince Henry had had his\r\n_entree_ to the grand ducal abbey of Ste. Hermenegilde, of which his\r\naunt is the superior, the poor nuns--"\r\n\r\n"Baron! baron! why--"\r\n\r\n"My dear sir, the air of Paris--But let us talk seriously. Shall I await\r\nthe rising of his royal highness to communicate all the particulars\r\nwhich I have procured?"\r\n\r\n"No, my dear baron. Monseigneur has desired that he should not be called\r\nbefore two or three o\'clock in the afternoon; he desires, also, that you\r\nsend off this morning these despatches by a special courier, instead of\r\nwaiting till Monday. You will entrust me with all the particulars you\r\nhave acquired, and I will communicate them to monseigneur when he wakes.\r\nThese are his orders."\r\n\r\n"Nothing can be better, and I think his royal highness will be satisfied\r\nwith what I have collected. But, my dear Murphy, I hope the despatch of\r\nthe special courier is not a bad sign; the last despatches which I had\r\nthe honour of sending to his royal highness--"\r\n\r\n"Announced that all was going on well at home; and it is precisely\r\nbecause my lord is desirous of expressing as early as possible his\r\nentire satisfaction, that he wishes a courier to be despatched this very\r\nday to Prince Herkhauesen-Oldenzaal, Chief of the Supreme Council."\r\n\r\n"That is so like his royal highness; were it to blame instead of\r\ncommend, he would observe less haste."\r\n\r\n"Nothing new has transpired with us, my dear baron,--nothing at all. Our\r\nmysterious adventures--"\r\n\r\n"Are wholly unknown. You know that, since the arrival of his royal\r\nhighness in Paris, his friends have become used to see him but little in\r\npublic; it is understood that he prefers seclusion, and is in the habit\r\nof making frequent excursions to the environs of Paris, and, with the\r\nexception of the Countess Sarah Macgregor and her brother, no person is\r\naware of the disguises assumed by his royal highness; and neither of the\r\npersonages I have mentioned have the smallest interest in betraying the\r\nsecret."\r\n\r\n"Ah! my dear baron," exclaimed Murphy, heaving a deep sigh, "what an\r\nunfortunate thing it is that this accursed countess should be left a\r\nwidow at this very important moment!"\r\n\r\n"She was married, I think, in 1827 or 1828?"\r\n\r\n"In 1827, shortly after the death of the unfortunate child, who would\r\nnow be in her sixteenth or seventeenth year, and whose loss his royal\r\nhighness seems daily more to deplore."\r\n\r\n"Far more so, indeed, than he appears to feel for the loss of his\r\nlegitimate offspring."\r\n\r\n"And thus, my dear baron, we may account for the deep interest his royal\r\nhighness takes in the poor Goualeuse, arising as it does from the fact\r\nthat the daughter so deeply deplored would, had she lived, have been\r\nprecisely the same age as this unfortunate young creature."\r\n\r\n"It is, indeed, an unfortunate affair that the Countess Sarah, from whom\r\nwe fancied we were for ever freed, should have become a widow exactly\r\neighteen months after his royal highness had been deprived by death of\r\nthe wife with whom he had passed years of wedded happiness. The\r\ncountess, I am persuaded, looks upon this double freedom from all\r\nmarriage vows as a signal intervention of Providence to further her\r\nviews."\r\n\r\n"And her impetuous passion has become more ardent than ever, though she\r\nis well aware that my lord feels for her the deepest aversion and\r\nwell-merited contempt. Was not her culpable indifference the cause of\r\nher child\'s death? Did she not cause--Ah, baron," said Murphy, leaving\r\nthe sentence unfinished, "this woman is our evil genius. God grant she\r\nmay not reappear amongst us laden with fresh misfortunes!"\r\n\r\n"But still, under present circumstances, any views Countess Sarah may\r\nentertain must be absurd in the greatest degree; the death of the\r\nunfortunate child you just now alluded to has broken the last tie which\r\nmight have attached my lord to this dangerous woman. She must be mad,\r\nas well as foolish, to persist in so hopeless a pursuit."\r\n\r\n"If she be mad, there is a dangerous \'method in her madness;\' her\r\nbrother, you are aware, partakes of her ambitious schemes and obstinate\r\nopinions of ultimate success. Although this worthy pair have as much\r\nreason for utter despair as they had eighteen years since of entire\r\nsuccess--"\r\n\r\n"Eighteen years! What an accumulation of evil has been wrought during\r\nthat period by the criminal compliance of that rascally Polidori!"\r\n\r\n"By the way, talking of that miserable wretch, I have traced that he was\r\nhere about a year or two ago, suffering, no doubt, from the most perfect\r\ndestitution, or else subsisting by disgraceful and dishonourable\r\npractices."\r\n\r\n"What a pity that a man so largely endowed with penetration, talent,\r\ndeep learning, and natural intelligence, should sink so low!"\r\n\r\n"The innate perversity of his character marred all these high qualities.\r\nIt is to be hoped he and the countess will not meet; the junction of two\r\nsuch evil spirits is indeed to be feared, for what frightful\r\nconsequences might there not result from it! Now, touching the facts you\r\nhave been collecting, have you them about you?"\r\n\r\n"Here," said the baron, drawing a paper from his pocket, "are the\r\nvarious particulars I have been enabled to collect touching the birth of\r\na young girl known as La Goualeuse, and also of the now residence of an\r\nindividual called Francois Germain, son of the Schoolmaster."\r\n\r\n"Be kind enough to read me the result of your inquiries, my dear De\r\nGrauen. I am well aware what are his royal highness\'s intentions in the\r\nmatter; I shall be able to judge then whether the information you\r\npossess will be sufficient to enable him to carry them into effect. You\r\nhave every reason to be satisfied with the agent you employ, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, he is a rare fellow! so precise, methodical, zealous, and\r\nintelligent! I am, indeed, sometimes obliged to moderate his energy; for\r\nI am well aware there are certain points, the clearing up of which his\r\nhighness reserves for himself."\r\n\r\n"And, of course, your agent is far from suspecting the deep interest his\r\nroyal highness has in the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Entirely so. My diplomatic position affords an excellent pretext for\r\nthe inquiries I have undertaken. M. Badinot (for such is the name of the\r\nperson I am speaking of) is a sharp, shrewd individual, having\r\nconnections, either recognised or concealed, in every grade of society.\r\nHe was formerly a lawyer, but compelled to quit his profession from some\r\nvery serious breach of trust; he has, however, retained very accurate\r\nrecollections touching the fortunes and situations of his old clients;\r\nhe knows many a secret, which he boasts, with considerable effrontery,\r\nof having turned to a good account. By turns, rich and poor,--now\r\nsuccessful, and then a ruined man,--he only ceased his speculations when\r\nnone could be found to take part in them with him; reduced to live from\r\nday to day by expedients more or less illegal, he became a curious\r\nspecimen of the Figaro school,--so long as his interest was concerned he\r\nwould devote himself, soul and body, to his employer; and we are sure of\r\nhis fidelity, for the simple reason that he has nothing to gain, though\r\na great deal to lose, by deceiving us; and, besides, I make him careful\r\nof our interests, even unknown to himself."\r\n\r\n"The particulars he has hitherto furnished us with have been very\r\ncorrect and satisfactory."\r\n\r\n"Oh, he has a very straightforward manner of going to work! And I assure\r\nyou, my dear Murphy, that M. Badinot is the very original type of one of\r\nthose mysterious existences which are to be met with, and only\r\npossible, in Paris. He would greatly amuse his royal highness, if it\r\nwere not necessary to avoid their being known to each other in this\r\nbusiness."\r\n\r\n"You can augment the pay of M. Badinot if you deem it necessary."\r\n\r\n"Why, really, five hundred francs a month, and his expenses, amounting\r\nto nearly the same sum, appear to me quite sufficient; we shall see by\r\nand by."\r\n\r\n"And does he not seem ashamed of the part he plays?"\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, he is not a little vain of his employment, and when he\r\nbrings me any particulars assumes a certain air of importance he would\r\nfain pass off as due to his diplomatic functions; for the fellow either\r\nthinks, or feigns to do so, that he is deeply engaged in state affairs,\r\nand ventures to observe at times, in a sort of undertone, how very\r\nmarvellous it is that such close and intimate relationship should be\r\nfound to exist between every-day events and the destinies of kingdoms!\r\nYes, really, he had the impudence to remark to me the other day, \'What\r\ncomplicated machinery is contained in the grand machine of state\r\naffairs! Who would think now, M. le Baron, those little humble notes\r\ncollected by me will have their part to play in directing and regulating\r\nthe affairs of Europe!\'"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, rascals generally seek to veil their mean and base practices\r\nbeneath some high-sounding pretext. But the notes you are to give me, my\r\ndear baron, have you them with you?"\r\n\r\n"Here they are, drawn up precisely from the accounts furnished by M.\r\nBadinot."\r\n\r\n"Pray let me hear them; I am all attention."\r\n\r\nM. de Grauen then read as follows:\r\n\r\n"_Note relative to Fleur-de-Marie._--About the beginning of the year\r\n1827, a man named Pierre Tournemine, then under sentence in the galleys\r\nat Rochefort for forgery, proposed to a woman named Gervais, but also\r\nknown as La Chouette, to take perpetual charge of a little girl, then\r\nbetween five and six years of age, for a sum of one thousand francs paid\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n"The bargain being concluded, the child was delivered over to the woman,\r\nwith whom she remained two years, when, unable longer to endure the\r\ncruelty shown her, the little girl disappeared; nor did the Chouette\r\nhear anything of her for several years, when she unexpectedly met with\r\nher at a small public-house in the Cite, nearly seven weeks ago. The\r\ninfant, now grown into a young woman, then bore the appellation of La\r\nGoualeuse.\r\n\r\n"A few days previously to this meeting, the above mentioned Tournemine,\r\nwho had become acquainted with the Schoolmaster at the galleys of\r\nRochefort, had sent to Bras Rouge (the regular, though concealed\r\ncorrespondent of every rogue and felon either in prison or out of it) a\r\nlengthened detail of every particular relative to the child formerly\r\nconfided to the woman Gervais, otherwise the Chouette.\r\n\r\n"From this account, and the declarations of the Chouette, it appeared\r\nthat one Madame Seraphin, housekeeper to a notary named Jacques Ferrand,\r\nhad in 1827 instructed Tournemine to find a person who, for the sum of\r\none thousand francs, would be willing to take the entire charge of a\r\nchild of from five to six years of age whom it was desired to get rid\r\nof, as has before been mentioned.\r\n\r\n"The Chouette accepted the proposition, and received both the child and\r\nthe stipulated sum of money.\r\n\r\n"The aim of Tournemine, in addressing these particulars to Bras Rouge,\r\nwas to enable the latter to extort money from Madame Seraphin, whom\r\nTournemine considered but as the agent of a third party, under a threat\r\nof revealing the whole affair unless well paid for silence.\r\n\r\n"Bras Rouge entrusted the Chouette, long the established partner in all\r\nthe Schoolmaster\'s schemes of villainy; and this explains how so\r\nimportant a document found its way to that monster\'s possession, and\r\nalso accounts for the expression used by the Chouette at her rencontre\r\nwith the Goualeuse in the cabaret of the White Rabbit, when, by way of\r\ntormenting her victim, she said, \'We have found out all about your\r\nparents, but you shall never know who or what they are.\'\r\n\r\n"The point to be decided was as to the veracity of the circumstances\r\ndetailed by Tournemine in his letter to the Chouette.\r\n\r\n"It has been ascertained that Madame Seraphin and the notary, Jacques\r\nFerrand, are both living; the address of the latter is Rue du Sentier,\r\nNo. 41, where he passes for a person of pious and austere life; at\r\nleast, he is constant in his attendance at church,--his attention to his\r\nprofessional duties, close and severe, though some accuse him of\r\nfollowing up the severity of the law with unnecessary rigour. In his\r\nmode of living he observes a parsimony bordering on avarice. Madame\r\nSeraphin still resides with him, as manager of his household; and M.\r\nJacques Ferrand, spite of his original poverty, has invested thirty-five\r\nthousand francs in the funds, the greatest part of this sum having been\r\nsupplied to him through a M. Charles Robert, a superior officer of the\r\nNational Guard,--a young and handsome man, in high repute with a certain\r\nclass of society. \'Tis true that some ill-natured persons are found to\r\nassert that, owing either to fortunate speculations or lucky hits upon\r\nthe Stock Exchange, undertaken in partnership with the above mentioned\r\nCharles Robert, the worthy notary could now well afford to pay back the\r\noriginal loan with high interest; but the rigidly austere and\r\nself-denying life of this worthy man gives a flat denial to all such\r\ngossiping reports, and, spite of the incredulity with which he is\r\noccasionally listened to, he persists in styling himself a man\r\nstruggling for a maintenance. There can be no manner of doubt but that\r\nMadame Seraphin, this worthy gentleman\'s housekeeper, could, if she\r\npleased, throw an entire light upon every circumstance connected with\r\nLa Goualeuse."\r\n\r\n"Bravo, my dear baron!" exclaimed Murphy; "nothing can be better. These\r\ndeclarations of Tournemine carry with them an appearance of truth, and\r\nit seems more than probable that we may, through Jacques Ferrand, obtain\r\nthe right clue to discovering the parents of this unfortunate girl. Now\r\ntell me, have you been equally successful in the information collected\r\ntouching the son of the Schoolmaster?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, as regards him, I am not furnished with such minute\r\nparticulars; but, upon the whole, I think the result of our inquiries\r\nvery satisfactory."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, your M. Badinot is a downright treasure!"\r\n\r\n"You see, Bras Rouge is the hinge upon which everything turns. M.\r\nBadinot, who has several acquaintances in the police, pointed him out to\r\nus as the go-between of several notorious felons, and knew the man\r\ndirectly he was set to discover what had become of the ill-fated son of\r\nMadame Georges Duresnel, the unfortunate wife of this atrocious\r\nSchoolmaster."\r\n\r\n"And it was in going to search for Bras Rouge, in his den in the Cite\r\n(Rue aux Feves, No. 13), that my lord fell in with the Chourineur and La\r\nGoualeuse. His royal highness hoped, too, that the opportunity now\r\nbefore him, of visiting these abodes of vice and wretchedness, might\r\nafford him the means of rescuing some unfortunate being from the depths\r\nof guilt and misery. His benevolent anticipations were gratified, but at\r\nwhat risk it is painful even to remember."\r\n\r\n"Whatever dangers attended the scheme, you, at least, my dear Murphy,\r\nbravely bore your share in them."\r\n\r\n"Was not I, for that very purpose, appointed charcoal-man in waiting\r\nupon his royal highness?" replied the squire, smilingly.\r\n\r\n"Say, rather, his intrepid body-guard, my worthy friend. But to touch\r\nupon your courage and devotion is only to repeat what every one knows. I\r\nwill, therefore, spare your modesty, and continue my relation. Here are\r\nthe various particulars we have been able to glean concerning Francois\r\nGermain, son of Madame Georges and the Schoolmaster, properly called\r\nDuresnel:\r\n\r\n"About eighteen months since, a young man, named Francois Germain,\r\narrived in Paris from Nantes, where he had been employed in the\r\nbanking-house of Noel and Co.\r\n\r\n"It seems, both from the confession of the Schoolmaster as well as from\r\nseveral letters found upon him, that the scoundrel to whom he had\r\nentrusted his unfortunate offspring, for the purpose of perverting his\r\nyoung mind, and rendering him one day a worthy assistant to his\r\nunprincipled father in his nefarious schemes, proposed to the young man\r\nto join in a plot for robbing his employers, as well as to forge upon\r\nthe firm to a considerable amount. This proposition was received by the\r\nyouth with well-merited indignation, but, unwilling to denounce the man\r\nby whom he had been brought up, he first communicated anonymously to his\r\nmaster the designs projected against the bank, and then privately\r\nquitted Nantes, that he might avoid the rage and fury of those whose\r\nsinful practices his soul sickened and shuddered to think of, far less\r\nto bear the idea of participating in.\r\n\r\n"These wretches, aware that they had betrayed themselves to the young\r\nman, and dreading the use he might make of his information, immediately\r\nupon finding he had quitted Nantes followed him to Paris, with the most\r\nsinister intentions of silencing him for ever. After long and\r\npersevering inquiries, they succeeded in discovering his address, but,\r\nhappily for the persecuted object of their search, he had a few days\r\npreviously encountered the villain who had first sought to corrupt his\r\nprinciples, and, well divining the motive which had brought him to\r\nParis, lost no time in changing his abode; and so, for this time, the\r\nSchoolmaster\'s hapless son escaped his pursuers. Still, however,\r\nfollowing up the scent, they succeeded in tracing the youth to his fresh\r\nabode, 17 Rue du Temple. One evening, however, he narrowly escaped\r\nfalling into an ambush laid for him (the Schoolmaster concealed this\r\ncircumstance from my lord), but again Providence befriended him, and he\r\nescaped, though too much alarmed to remain in his lodgings; he once more\r\nchanged his abode, since which time all traces of him have been lost.\r\nAnd matters had reached thus far when the Schoolmaster received the just\r\npunishment of his crimes; since which period, by order of my lord, fresh\r\ninquiries have been instituted, of which the following is the result.\r\n\r\n"Francois Germain lived for about three months at No. 17 Rue du Temple,\r\na house rendered worthy of observation by the habits and ingenious\r\npractices of its inhabitants. Germain was a great favourite among them,\r\nby reason of his kind and amiable disposition, as well as for the frank\r\ngaiety of his temper. Although his means of livelihood appeared very\r\nslender, yet he had rendered the most generous assistance to an indigent\r\nfamily occupying the garrets of the house. In vain has been every\r\ninquiry made in the Rue du Temple touching the present residence of\r\nFrancois Germain, or the profession he was supposed to follow; every one\r\nin the house believed him to be employed in some counting-house, or\r\noffice, as he went out early in the morning and never returned till late\r\nin the evening. The only person who really knows the present residence\r\nof the young man is a female, lodging in the house No. 17 Rue du\r\nTemple,--a young and pretty grisette, named Rigolette, between whom and\r\nGermain a very close acquaintance appears to have existed. She occupies\r\nthe adjoining room to that which Germain tenanted, and which chamber, by\r\nthe by, is still vacant; and it was under pretext of inquiring about it\r\nthat these particulars were obtained."\r\n\r\n"Rigolette!" exclaimed Murphy, after having been for several minutes\r\napparently in deep thought. "Yes, I am sure I know her."\r\n\r\n"_You!_ Sir Walter Murphy," replied the baron, much amused. "You, most\r\nworthy and respectable father of a family! _you_ know anything of pretty\r\ngrisettes! And so the name of Mlle. Rigolette is familiar to you, is it?\r\nFie, fie! Oh, positively I am ashamed of you!"\r\n\r\n"\'Pon my soul, my lord compelled me to have so many strange\r\nacquaintances, that such a mere trifle as this should pass for nothing.\r\nBut wait a bit. Yes, now I recollect perfectly, that when my lord was\r\nrelating the history of La Goualeuse, I could not help laughing at the\r\nvery odd name of Rigolette, which, as far as I can call to mind, was the\r\nname of a prison acquaintance of that poor Fleur-de-Marie."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, just at this particular juncture Mlle. Rigolette may be of\r\nthe utmost service to us. Let me conclude my report:\r\n\r\n"There might possibly be an advantage in engaging the vacant chamber\r\nrecently belonging to Germain, in the Rue du Temple. We have no\r\ninstructions to proceed further in our investigations, but, from some\r\nwords which escaped the porteress, there is every reason to believe that\r\nnot only would it be possible to find in this house certain indications\r\nof where the Schoolmaster\'s son may be heard of, through the means of\r\nMlle. Rigolette, but the house itself would afford my lord an\r\nopportunity of studying human nature amid wants, difficulties, and\r\nmisery, the very existence of which he is far from suspecting."\r\n\r\n"Thus you see, my dear Murphy," said M. de Grauen, finishing his report\r\nand presenting it to his companion, "you see evidently that it is from\r\nthe notary, Jacques Ferrand, we must hope to obtain information\r\nrespecting the parentage of La Goualeuse, and that we must go to Mlle.\r\nRigolette to trace the dwelling of Francois Germain. It seems to me a\r\ngreat point to have ascertained the direction in which to search."\r\n\r\n"Undoubtedly, baron; you are quite right; and, besides, I am sure my\r\nlord will find a fine field for observation in the house of which you\r\nspeak. But I have not yet done with you. Have you made any inquiries\r\nrespecting the Marquis d\'Harville?"\r\n\r\n"I have; and, so far as concerns money matters, his royal highness\'s\r\nfears are wholly unfounded. M. Badinot affirms (and he is very likely to\r\nbe well informed on the subject) that the fortune of the marquis has\r\nnever been in a more prosperous condition, or better managed."\r\n\r\n"Why, after having in vain exhausted every other conjecture as to the\r\nsecret grief which is preying upon M. d\'Harville, my lord imagined that\r\nit was just probable the marquis had some pecuniary difficulties; had it\r\nproved so, he would have removed them with that delicate assumption of\r\nmystery you know he so frequently employs to veil his munificence. But,\r\nsince even this conjecture has failed, he must abandon all hope of\r\nguessing the enigma; and this he will do the more reluctantly, as his\r\ngreat desire to discover it arose out of his ardent friendship for M.\r\nd\'Harville."\r\n\r\n"A friendship which is founded on a grateful recollection of the\r\nimportant services rendered by the marquis\'s father to his own parent.\r\nAre you aware, my dear Murphy, that at the remodelling of the States in\r\n1815, at the Germanic confederation, the father of his royal highness\r\nhad a chance of being excluded, from his well-known attachment to\r\nNapoleon? Thanks to the friendship with which the Emperor Alexander\r\nhonoured him, the deceased Marquis d\'Harville was enabled to render most\r\neffectual service to the father of our patron. The emperor, whose warm\r\nregard for the late marquis had taken its date from the period of that\r\nnobleman\'s emigration to Russia, exerted his powerful influence in\r\ncongress so successfully, that at the grand meeting to decide the\r\ndestinies of the princes of Germany, the father of our noble employer\r\nwas reinstated in all his pristine rights. As for the friendship now\r\nsubsisting between the present marquis and his royal highness, I believe\r\nit commenced when, as mere boys, they met together on a visit paid by\r\nthe then reigning grand duke to the late Marquis d\'Harville."\r\n\r\n"So I have heard; and they appear to have retained a most lively\r\nrecollection of this happy period of their youth. Nor is this all I have\r\nto say on the subject of the interest our noble master takes in every\r\nmatter concerning the house of D\'Harville. So profound is his gratitude\r\nfor the services rendered to his father, that all bearing the honoured\r\nname of D\'Harville, or belonging to the family, possess a powerful claim\r\non the kindness of the prince. Thus, not alone to her virtues or her\r\nmisfortunes does poor Madame Georges owe the increasing and unwearied\r\ngoodness of my lord."\r\n\r\n"Madame Georges!" exclaimed the astounded baron. "What, the wife of\r\nDuresnel, the felon known as the Schoolmaster?"\r\n\r\n"And the mother of Francois Germain, the youth we are seeking for, and\r\nwhom, I trust, we shall find."\r\n\r\n"Is the relation of M. d\'Harville?"\r\n\r\n"She was his mother\'s cousin, and her most intimate friend; the old\r\nmarquis entertained the most perfect friendship and esteem for Madame\r\nGeorges."\r\n\r\n"But how, for heaven\'s sake, my dear Murphy, did it ever come about that\r\nthe D\'Harville family ever permitted a descendant of theirs to marry\r\nsuch a monster as this Duresnel?"\r\n\r\n"Why, thus it was. The father of this unfortunate woman was a M. de\r\nLagny, who, previous to the Revolution, possessed considerable property\r\nin Languedoc, and who, having fortunately escaped the proscription so\r\nfatal to many, availed himself of the first tranquillity which succeeded\r\nthese days of discord and anarchy to establish his only daughter in\r\nmarriage. Among the various candidates for the hand of the young heiress\r\nwas this Duresnel, the representative of a wealthy and respectable\r\nfamily, possessing powerful parliamentary influence, and concealing the\r\ndepravity of his disposition beneath the most specious exterior. To this\r\nman was Mlle. de Lagny united, by desire of her father; but a very short\r\ntime sufficed to strip the mask from his vicious character, and to\r\ndisplay his natural propensities. A gambler, a spendthrift, and\r\nprofligate, addicted to the lowest vices that can disgrace a human\r\nbeing, he quickly dissipated, not only his own fortune, but that of his\r\nwife also. Even the estate to which Madame Georges Duresnel had retired\r\nwas involved in the general ruin occasioned by her worthless husband\'s\r\npassion for play, and his dissolute mode of life; and the unfortunate\r\nwoman would have been left without a shelter for herself or infant son\r\nbut for the kind affection of her relation, the Marquise d\'Harville,\r\nwhom she loved with the tenderness of a sister. With this valued friend\r\nMadame Duresnel found a welcome home, while her wretched husband,\r\nfinding himself utterly ruined, plunged into the blackest crimes, and\r\nstopped at no means, however guilty and desperate, to supply his\r\npleasures. He became the associate of thieves, murderers, pickpockets,\r\nand forgers, and ere long, falling into the hands of the law, was\r\nsentenced to the galleys for the term of his natural life. Yet, while\r\nsuffering the just punishment of his crimes, his base mind devised the\r\ndouble atrocity of tearing the child from its miserable mother, for the\r\nsake of breaking down every good principle it might have imbibed, and of\r\ntraining it up in vicious readiness to join his future schemes of\r\nvillainy. You know the rest. After the condemnation of her husband,\r\nMadame Georges, without giving any reason for so doing, quitted the\r\nMarquise d\'Harville, and went to hide her shame and her sorrows in\r\nParis, where she soon fell into the utmost distress. It would occupy\r\ntoo much time to tell you by what train of events my lord became aware\r\nof the misfortunes of this excellent woman, as well as the ties which\r\nconnect her with the D\'Harville family; it is sufficient that he came\r\nmost opportunely and generously to her assistance, induced her to quit\r\nParis and establish herself at the farm at Bouqueval, where she now is,\r\nwith the Goualeuse. In this peaceful retreat she has found tranquillity,\r\nif not happiness; and the overlooking and management of the farm may\r\nserve to recreate her thoughts, and prevent them from dwelling too\r\ndeeply on her past sorrows. As much to spare the almost morbid\r\nsensibility of Madame Georges, as because he dislikes to blazon forth\r\nhis good deeds, my lord has not even acquainted M. d\'Harville with the\r\nfact of his having relieved his kinswoman from such severe distress."\r\n\r\n"I comprehend now the twofold interest which my lord has in desiring to\r\ndiscover the traces of the son of this poor woman."\r\n\r\n"You may also judge by that, my dear baron, of the affection which his\r\nroyal highness bears to the whole family, and how deep is his vexation\r\nat seeing the young marquis so sad, with so many reasons to be happy."\r\n\r\n"What can there be wanting to M. d\'Harville? He unites all,--birth,\r\nfortune, wit, youth; his wife is charming, and as prudent as she is\r\nlovely."\r\n\r\n"True, and his royal highness only had recourse to the inquiries we have\r\nbeen talking over after having in vain endeavoured to penetrate the\r\ncause of M. d\'Harville\'s deep melancholy; he showed himself deeply\r\naffected by the kind attentions of monseigneur, but still has been\r\nentirely reserved on the subject of his low spirits. It may be some\r\n_peine de coeur_."\r\n\r\n"Yet it is said that he is excessively fond of his wife, and she does\r\nnot give him the least cause for jealousy. I often meet her in society,\r\nand, although she is constantly surrounded by admirers (as every young\r\nand lovely woman is), still her reputation is unsullied."\r\n\r\n"The marquis is always speaking of her in the highest terms; he has had,\r\nhowever, one little discussion with her on the subject of the Countess\r\nSarah Macgregor."\r\n\r\n"Has she, then, seen her?"\r\n\r\n"By a most unlucky chance, the father of the Marquis d\'Harville knew\r\nSarah Seyton of Halsburg, and her brother Tom, seventeen or eighteen\r\nyears ago, during their residence in Paris, and when they were much\r\nnoticed by the lady of the English ambassador. Learning that the brother\r\nand sister were going into Germany, the old marquis gave them letters of\r\nintroduction to the father of our noble lord, with whom he kept up a\r\nconstant correspondence. Alas! my dear De Grauen, perhaps but for these\r\nintroductions many misfortunes would have been avoided, for then\r\nmonseigneur would not have known this woman. When the Countess Sarah\r\nreturned hither, knowing the friendship of his royal highness for the\r\nmarquis, she presented herself at the Hotel d\'Harville, in the hope of\r\nmeeting monseigneur; for she shows as much pertinacity in pursuing him\r\nas he evinces resolution to avoid her."\r\n\r\n"Only imagine her disguising herself in male attire, and following him\r\ninto the Cite! No woman but she would have dreamt of such a thing."\r\n\r\n"She, perhaps, hoped by such a step to touch his royal highness and\r\ncompel him to an interview, which he has always refused and avoided. To\r\nreturn to Madame d\'Harville: her husband, to whom monseigneur has spoken\r\nof Sarah as she deserved, has begged his wife to see her as seldom as\r\npossible; but the young marquise, seduced by the hypocritical flatteries\r\nof the countess, has gone somewhat counter to the marquis\'s request.\r\nSome trifling differences have arisen, but not of sufficient importance\r\nto cause or explain the extreme dejection of the marquis."\r\n\r\n"Oh, the women! the women! My dear Murphy, I am very sorry that Madame\r\nd\'Harville should have formed any acquaintance with this Sarah. So young\r\nand charming a woman must suffer by the contact with such an infernal--"\r\n\r\n"Talking of infernal creatures," said Murphy, "here is a communication\r\nrelative to Cecily, the unworthy spouse of the excellent David."\r\n\r\n"Between ourselves, my dear Murphy, this audacious _metisse_[9] well\r\ndeserves the terrible punishment that her husband, our dear black\r\ndoctor, has inflicted on the Schoolmaster by monseigneur\'s order. She\r\nhas also shed blood, and her unblushing infamy is astounding."\r\n\r\n  [9] The Creole issue of a white and quadroon slave. The\r\n  _metisses_ only differ from the whites by some peculiarities\r\n  hardly perceptible.\r\n\r\n"Yet she is so very handsome,--so seductive! A perverted mind within an\r\nattractive outside always inspires me with twofold disgust."\r\n\r\n"In this sense Cecily is doubly hateful. But I hope that this despatch\r\nannuls the last orders issued by monseigneur with regard to this\r\nwretched creature."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, baron."\r\n\r\n"My lord, then, desires that her escape from the fortress in which she\r\nhad been shut up for life may be effected?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And that her pretended ravisher should bring her to France,--to Paris?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and, besides, this despatch orders the arrangement to be carried\r\nout as soon as possible, and that Cecily be made to travel hither so\r\nspeedily that she may arrive here in a fortnight."\r\n\r\n"I am lost in astonishment! Monseigneur has always evinced such a horror\r\nof her!"\r\n\r\n"And that horror he still experiences; if possible, stronger than ever."\r\n\r\n"And yet he causes her to be sent to him! To be sure, it will always be\r\neasy to apprehend Cecily again, if she does not carry out what he\r\nrequires of her. Orders are given to the son of the gaoler of the\r\nfortress of Gerolstein to carry her off, as if he were enamoured of her,\r\nand every facility will be given to him for effecting this purpose.\r\nOverjoyed at this opportunity of escaping, the _metisse_ will follow her\r\nsupposed ravisher, and reach Paris; then she will always have her\r\nsentence of condemnation hanging over her, always be but an escaped\r\nprisoner, and I shall be always ready, when it shall please his royal\r\nhighness to desire, again to lay hands upon and incarcerate her."\r\n\r\n"I should tell you, my dear baron, that when David learned from\r\nmonseigneur of the proposed arrival of Cecily, he was absolutely\r\npetrified, and exclaimed, \'I hope that your royal highness will not\r\ncompel me to see the monster?\' \'Make yourself easy,\' replied\r\nmonseigneur; \'you shall not see her, but I may require her services for\r\na particular purpose.\' David felt relieved of an enormous weight off his\r\nmind. Nevertheless, I am sure that some very painful reminiscences were\r\nawakened in his mind."\r\n\r\n"Poor negro! he loves her still. They say, too, that she is yet so\r\nlovely!"\r\n\r\n"Charming!--too charming! It requires the pitiless eye of a creole to\r\ndetect the mixed blood in the all but imperceptible shade which lightly\r\ntinges her rosy finger-nails. Our fresh and hale beauties of the North\r\nhave not a more transparent complexion, nor a skin of more dazzling\r\nwhiteness."\r\n\r\n"I was in France when monseigneur returned from America, accompanied by\r\nDavid and Cecily, and I know that that excellent man was from that time\r\nattached to his royal highness by ties of the strongest gratitude; but I\r\nnever learned how he became attached to the service of our master, and\r\nhow he had married Cecily, whom I saw, for the first time, about a year\r\nafter his marriage; and God knows the scandal that followed!"\r\n\r\n"I can tell you every particular that you may wish to learn, my dear\r\nbaron; I accompanied monseigneur in his voyage to America, when he\r\nrescued David and the _metisse_ from the most awful fate."\r\n\r\n"You are always most kind, my dear Murphy, and I am all attention," said\r\nthe baron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF DAVID AND CECILY.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Mr. Willis, a rich American planter, settled in Florida," said Murphy,\r\n"had discovered in one of his young black slaves, named David, who was\r\nemployed in the infirmary attached to his dwelling, a very remarkable\r\ndegree of intelligence, combined with a constant and deep commiseration\r\nfor the sick poor, to whom he gave, with the utmost attention and care,\r\nthe medicine ordered by the doctors, and, moreover, so strong a\r\nprepossession for the study of botany, as applied to medicine, that\r\nwithout any tuition he had composed and classified a sort of flora of\r\nthe plants around the dwelling and the vicinity. The establishment of\r\nMr. Willis, situated on the borders of the sea, was fifteen or twenty\r\nleagues from the nearest town; and the medical men of the district,\r\nignorant as they were, gave themselves no great deal of care or trouble,\r\nin consequence of the long distance and the difficulty in procuring any\r\nmeans of conveyance. Desirous of remedying so extreme an inconvenience\r\nin a country subject to violent epidemics, and to have at hand at all\r\ntimes a skilful practitioner, the colonist made up his mind to send\r\nDavid to France to learn surgery and medicine. Enchanted at this offer,\r\nthe young black set out for Paris, and the planter paid all the expenses\r\nof his course of study. David, having for eight years studied with great\r\ndiligence and remarkable effect, received the degree of surgeon and\r\nphysician with the most distinguished success, and then returned to\r\nAmerica to place himself and his skill under the direction of his\r\nmaster."\r\n\r\n"But David ought to have considered himself free and emancipated, in\r\nfact and in law, when he set foot in France."\r\n\r\n"David\'s loyalty is very rare: he had promised Mr. Willis to return, and\r\nhe did so. He did not consider as his own the instruction which he had\r\nacquired with his master\'s money; and, besides, he hoped to improve\r\nmorally as well as physically the sufferings of the slaves, his former\r\ncompanions; he trusted to become not only their doctor, but their firm\r\nfriend and defender with the colonist."\r\n\r\n"He must, indeed, be imbued with the most unflinching probity and the\r\nmost intense love for his fellow creatures to return to a master,--an\r\nowner,--after having spent eight years in the midst of the society of\r\nthe most democratic young men in Europe."\r\n\r\n"Judge of the man by this one trait. Well, he returned to Florida, and,\r\ntruth to tell, was used by Mr. Willis with consideration and kindness,\r\neating at his table, sleeping under his roof. But this colonist was as\r\nstupid, malevolent, selfish, and despotic as most creoles are, and he\r\nthought himself very generous in giving David six hundred francs\r\n(24_l._) a year salary. At the end of some months a terrible typhus\r\nfever broke out in the plantation. Mr. Willis was attacked by it, but\r\nsoon restored through the careful attentions and efficacious remedies of\r\nDavid. Out of thirty negroes dangerously affected by this fatal disease,\r\nonly two perished. Mr. Willis, much gratified by the services which\r\nDavid had so auspiciously rendered, raised his wages to twelve hundred\r\nfrancs, to the extreme gratification of the black doctor, whose fellows\r\nregarded him as a divinity amongst them, for he had, with much\r\ndifficulty it is true, obtained from their master some few indulgences,\r\nand was hoping to procure still more. In the meanwhile, he consoled\r\nthese poor people, and exhorted them to patience; spake to them of God,\r\nwho watches over the black and the white man with an equal eye; of\r\nanother world not peopled with masters and slaves, but with the just and\r\nthe unjust; of another life in eternity, where man was no longer the\r\nbeast of burden,--the property,--the thing of his fellow man, but where\r\nthe victims of this world were so happy that they prayed in heaven for\r\ntheir tormentors. What shall I tell you more? To those unhappy wretches\r\nwho, contrary to other men, count with bitter joy the hours which bring\r\nthem nearer to the tomb,--to those unfortunate creatures, who looked\r\nforward only to nothingness hereafter, David breathed the language and\r\nthe hope of a free and happy immortality; and then their chains appeared\r\nless heavy and their toil less irksome. He was their idol. A year passed\r\naway in this manner. Amongst the handsomest of the female slaves at the\r\nhouse was a _metisse_, about fifteen years of age, named Cecily, and for\r\nthis poor girl Mr. Willis took a fancy. For the first time in his life\r\nhis advances were repulsed and obstinately resisted; Cecily was in love,\r\nand with David, who, during the late fearful distemper, had attended her\r\nwith the most vigilant care. Afterwards a deep and mutual love repaid\r\nhim the debt of gratitude. David\'s taste was too refined to allow him to\r\nboast of his happiness before the time when he should marry Cecily,\r\nwhich was to be when she had turned her sixteenth year. Mr. Willis,\r\nignorant of their love, had thrown his handkerchief right royally at the\r\npretty _metisse_, and she, in deep despair, sought David, and told him\r\nall the brutal attempts that she had been subjected to and with\r\ndifficulty escaped. The black comforted her, and instantly went to Mr.\r\nWillis to request her hand in marriage."\r\n\r\n"_Diable!_ my dear Murphy, I can easily surmise the answer of the\r\nAmerican sultan,--he refused?"\r\n\r\n"He did. He said he had an inclination for the girl himself; that in\r\nhis life before he had never experienced the repulse of a slave; he\r\nmeant to possess her, and he would. David might choose another wife or\r\nmistress, whichsoever might best suit his inclination; there were in the\r\nplantation ten _capusses_ or _metisses_ as pretty as Cecily. David\r\ntalked of his love,--love so long and tenderly shared, and the planter\r\nshrugged his shoulders; David urged, but it was all in vain. The creole\r\nhad the cool impudence to tell him that it was a bad \'example\' to see a\r\nmaster concede to a slave, and that he would not set that \'example\' to\r\nsatisfy a caprice of David\'s! He entreated,--supplicated, and his master\r\nlost his temper. David, blushing to humiliate himself further, spake in\r\na firm tone of his services and disinterestedness,--that he had been\r\ncontented with a very slender salary. Mr. Willis was desperately\r\nenraged, and, telling him he was a contumacious slave, threatened him\r\nwith the chain. David replied with a few bitter and violent words; and,\r\ntwo hours afterwards, bound to a stake, his skin was torn with the lash,\r\nwhilst they bore Cecily to the harem of the planter in his sight."\r\n\r\n"The conduct of the planter was brutal and horrible; it was adding\r\nabsurdity to cruelty, for he must after that have required the man\'s\r\nservices."\r\n\r\n"Precisely so; for that very day the very fury into which he had worked\r\nhimself, joined to the drunkenness in which the brute indulged every\r\nevening, brought on an inflammatory attack of the most dangerous\r\ndescription, the symptoms of which appeared with the rapidity peculiar\r\nto such affections. The planter was carried to his bed in a state of the\r\nhighest fever. He sent off an express for a doctor, but he could not\r\nreach his abode in less than six and thirty hours."\r\n\r\n"Really, this attack seems providential. The desperate condition of the\r\nman was quite deserved by him."\r\n\r\n"The malady made fearful strides. David only could save the colonist,\r\nbut Willis, distrustful, as all evil-doers are, imagined that the black\r\nwould revenge himself by administering poison; for, after having\r\nscourged him with a rod, he had thrown him into prison. At last,\r\nhorrified at the progress of his illness, broken down by bodily anguish,\r\nand thinking that, as death also stared him in the face, he had one\r\nchance left in trusting to the generosity of his slave, after many\r\ndistrusting doubts, Willis ordered David to be unchained."\r\n\r\n"And David saved the planter?"\r\n\r\n"For five days and five nights he watched and tended him as if he had\r\nbeen his father, counteracting the disease, step by step, with great\r\nskill and perfect knowledge, until, at last, he succeeded in defeating\r\nit, to the extreme surprise of the doctor who had been sent for, and who\r\ndid not arrive until the second day."\r\n\r\n"And, when restored to health at last, the colonist--"\r\n\r\n"Not desiring to blush before his own slave, whose presence constantly\r\noppressed him with the recollection of his excessive nobleness of\r\nconduct, the colonist made an enormous sacrifice to attach the doctor he\r\nhad sent for to his establishment, and David was again conducted to his\r\ndungeon."\r\n\r\n"Horrible, but by no means astonishing. David must have been in the eyes\r\nof his brutal master a complete living remorse."\r\n\r\n"Such conduct was dictated alike by revenge and jealousy. The blacks of\r\nMr. Willis loved David with all the warmth of gratitude, for he had\r\nsaved them body and soul. They knew the care he had bestowed on him when\r\nhe lay tossing with fever between life and death, and, shaking off the\r\ndeadening apathy which ordinarily besets slavery, these unfortunate\r\ncreatures evinced their indignation, or rather grief, most powerfully\r\nwhen they saw David lacerated by the whip. Mr. Willis, deeply\r\nexasperated, affected to discover in this manifestation the appearance\r\nof revolt, and, when he considered the influence which David had\r\nacquired over the slaves, he believed him capable of placing himself at\r\nthe head of a rebellion to avenge himself of his wrongs. This fear was\r\nanother motive with the colonist for using David in the most shameful\r\nmanner, and entirely preventing him from effecting the malicious designs\r\nof which he suspected him."\r\n\r\n"Considering him as actuated by an irrepressible amount of terror, this\r\nconduct seems less stupid, but quite as ferocious."\r\n\r\n"A short time after these events we arrived in America. Monseigneur had\r\nfreighted a Danish brig at St. Thomas\'s, and we visited incognito all\r\nthe settlements of the American coast along which we were sailing. We\r\nwere most hospitably received by Mr. Willis, who, the evening after our\r\narrival, after he had been drinking, and as much from the excitement of\r\nwine as from a desire to boast, told us, in a horrid tone of brutal\r\njesting, the history of David and Cecily. I forgot to say that, after\r\nhaving maltreated the girl, he had thrown her into a dungeon also, as a\r\npunishment for her disdain of him. His royal highness, on hearing\r\nWillis\'s fearful narration, thought the man was either drunk or a liar;\r\nbut he was drunk,--it was no lie. To remove any and all doubt, the\r\ncolonist rose from the table, and desired a slave to bear a lantern and\r\nconduct us to David\'s cell."\r\n\r\n"Well, what followed?"\r\n\r\n"In my life I never saw so distressing a spectacle. Pale, wan, meagre,\r\nhalf naked, and covered with wounds, David and the unhappy girl, chained\r\nby the middle of the body, one at one end and the other at the other end\r\nof the dungeon, looked like spectres. The lantern that lighted us threw\r\nover this scene a still more ghastly hue. David did not utter a word\r\nwhen he saw us; his gaze was fixed and fearful. The colonist said to\r\nhim, with cruel irony, \'Well, doctor, how goes it? You, who are so\r\nclever, why don\'t you cure yourself?\' The black replied by a noble word\r\nand a dignified gesture; he raised his right hand slowly, his forefinger\r\npointed to the roof, and, without looking at the colonist, said in a\r\nsolemn tone, \'God!\' and then was silent. \'God?\' replied the planter,\r\nbursting into a loud fit of laughter, \'tell him, then,--tell God to come\r\nand snatch you from my power! I defy him!\' Then Willis, overcome by fury\r\nand intoxication, shook his fist to heaven, and said, in blasphemous\r\nlanguage, \'Yes, I defy God to carry off my slaves before they are\r\ndead!\'"\r\n\r\n"The man was mad as well as brutal."\r\n\r\n"We were utterly disgusted. Monseigneur did not say a word, and we left\r\nthe cell. This dungeon was situated, as well as the house, on the\r\nseashore. We returned to our brig, which was moored a short distance\r\noff, and at one o\'clock in the morning, when all in the building were\r\nplunged in profound sleep, monseigneur went on shore with eight men well\r\narmed, and, going straight to the prison, burst open the doors, and\r\nfreed David and Cecily. The two victims were carried on board so quietly\r\nthat they were not perceived; and then monseigneur and I went to the\r\nplanter\'s house. Strange contrast! These men torture their slaves, and\r\nyet do not take any precaution against them, but sleep with doors and\r\nwindows open. We easily got access to the sleeping-room of the planter,\r\nwhich was lighted on the inside by a small glass lamp. Monseigneur\r\nawakened the man, who sat upright in his bed, his brain still disturbed\r\nby the effect of his drunkenness. \'You have to-night defied God to carry\r\noff your two victims before their death, and he has taken them,\' said\r\nmonseigneur. Then taking a bag which I carried, and which contained\r\ntwenty-five thousand francs in gold, he threw it on the fellow\'s bed,\r\nand added, \'This will indemnify you for the loss of your two slaves,--to\r\nyour violence that destroys I oppose a violence that saves. God will\r\njudge between us.\' We then retreated, leaving Mr. Willis stupefied,\r\nmotionless, and believing himself under the influence of a dream. A few\r\nminutes later we were again on board the brig, which instantly set\r\nsail."\r\n\r\n"It appears to me, my dear Murphy, that his royal highness overpaid this\r\nwretch for the loss of his slaves; for, in fact, David no longer\r\nbelonged to him."\r\n\r\n"We calculated, as nearly as we could, the expense which his studies had\r\ncost for eight years, and then the price, thrice over, of himself and\r\nCecily as slaves. Our conduct was contrary to the rights of property, I\r\nknow; but if you had seen in what a horrible state we found this\r\nunfortunate and half-dead couple, if you had heard the sacrilegious\r\ndefiance almost cast in the face of the Almighty by this man, drunk with\r\nwine and ferocity, you would comprehend how monseigneur desired, as he\r\nsaid, on this occasion to act as it were in behalf of Providence."\r\n\r\n"All this is as assailable and as justifiable as the punishment of the\r\nSchoolmaster, my worthy squire. And had not this adventure any\r\nconsequences?"\r\n\r\n"It could not. The brig was under Danish colours; the incognito of his\r\nroyal highness was closely kept; we were taken for rich Englishmen. To\r\nwhom could Willis have addressed his complaints, if he had any to make?\r\nIn fact, he had told us himself, and the medical man of monseigneur\r\ndeclared it in a _proces verbal_, that the two slaves could not have\r\nlived eight days longer in this frightful dungeon. It required the\r\ngreatest possible care to snatch David and Cecily from almost certain\r\ndeath. At last they were restored to life. From this period David has\r\nbeen attached to the suite of monseigneur as a medical man, and is most\r\ndevotedly attached to him."\r\n\r\n"David married Cecily, of course, on arriving in Europe?"\r\n\r\n"This marriage, which ought to have been followed by results so happy,\r\ntook place in the chapel of the palace of monseigneur; but, by a most\r\nextraordinary revulsion of conduct, hardly was she in the full enjoyment\r\nof an unhoped-for position, when, forgetting all that David had suffered\r\nfor her and what she had suffered for him, blushing in the new world to\r\nbe wedded to a black, Cecily, seduced by a man of most depraved morals,\r\ncommitted her first fault. It would seem as though the natural\r\nperversity of this abandoned woman, having till then slumbered, was\r\nsuddenly awakened, and developed itself with fearful energy. You know\r\nthe rest, and all the scandal of the adventures that followed. After\r\nhaving been two years a wife, David, whose confidence in her was only\r\nequalled by his love, learned the full extent of her infamy,--a\r\nthunderbolt aroused him from his blind security."\r\n\r\n"They say he tried to kill his wife."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but, through the interference of monseigneur, he consented to\r\nallow her to be immured for life in a prison, and it is thence that\r\nmonseigneur now seeks to have her released,--to your great astonishment,\r\nas well as mine, my dear baron. But it is growing late, and his royal\r\nhighness is anxious that your courier should start for Gerolstein with\r\nas little delay as possible."\r\n\r\n"In two hours\' time he shall be on the road. So now, my dear Murphy,\r\nfarewell till the evening."\r\n\r\n"Till the evening, adieu."\r\n\r\n"Have you, then, forgotten that there is a grand ball at the ----\r\nEmbassy, and that his royal highness will be present?"\r\n\r\n"True. I have always forgotten that, since the absence of Colonel Verner\r\nand the Count d\'Harneim, I have the honour to fulfil the functions of\r\nchamberlain and aide-de-camp."\r\n\r\n"Ah, apropos of the count and the colonel, when may we expect their\r\nreturn? Will they have soon completed their respective missions?"\r\n\r\n"You know that monseigneur will keep them away as long as possible,\r\nthat he may enjoy more solitude and liberty. As to the errand on which\r\nhis royal highness has employed each of them, as an ostensible motive\r\nfor getting rid of them in a quiet way,--sending one to Avignon and the\r\nother to Strasbourg,--I will tell you all about it some day, when we are\r\nboth in a dull mood; for I will defy the most hypochondriacal person in\r\nexistence not to burst with laughter at the narrative, as well as with\r\ncertain passages in the despatches of these worthy gentlemen, who have\r\nassumed their pretended missions with so serious an air."\r\n\r\n"To tell the truth, I have never clearly understood why his royal\r\nhighness attached the colonel and the count to his private person."\r\n\r\n"Why, my dear fellow, is not Colonel Verner the accurate type of\r\nmilitary perfection? Is there, in the whole Germanic confederation, a\r\nmore elegant figure, more flourishing and splendid moustaches, and a\r\nmore complete military figure? And when he is fully decorated, screwed\r\nin, uniformed, gold-laced, plumed, etc., etc., it is impossible to see a\r\nmore glorious, self-satisfied, proud, handsome--animal."\r\n\r\n"True, but it is his very good looks that prevent him from having the\r\nappearance of a man of refined and acute intellect."\r\n\r\n"Well! and monseigneur says that, thanks to the colonel, he is in the\r\nhabit of finding even the dullest people in the world bearable. Before\r\ncertain audiences, which are of necessity, he shuts himself up with the\r\ncolonel for a half-hour or so, and then leaves him, full of spirits and\r\nlight as air, quite ready to meet bores and defy them."\r\n\r\n"Just as the Roman soldier who, before a forced march, used to sole his\r\nsandals with lead, and so found all fatigue light by leaving them off. I\r\nnow discover the usefulness of the colonel. But the Count d\'Harneim?"\r\n\r\n"Is also very serviceable to our dear lord; for, always hearing at his\r\nside the tinkling of this old cracked bell, shining and\r\nchattering,--continually seeing this soap-bubble so puffed up with\r\nnothingness, so magnificently variegated, and, as such, portraying the\r\ntheatrical and puerile phase of sovereign power,--his royal highness\r\nfeels the more sensibly the vanity of those barren pomps and glories of\r\nthe world, and, by contrast, has often derived the most serious and\r\nhappy ideas from the contemplation of his useless and pattering\r\nchamberlain."\r\n\r\n"Well, well; but let us be just, my dear Murphy: tell me, in what court\r\nin the world would you find a more perfect model of a chamberlain? Who\r\nknows better than dear old D\'Harneim the numberless rules and strict\r\nobservances of etiquette? Who bears with more becoming demeanour an\r\nenamelled cross around his neck, or more majestically comports himself\r\nwhen the keys of office are suspended from his shoulders?"\r\n\r\n"Apropos, baron; monseigneur declares that the shoulders of a\r\nchamberlain have a peculiar physiognomy: that is, he says, an appearance\r\nat once constrained and repulsive, which it is painful to look at; for,\r\nalas and alackaday! it is at the back of a chamberlain that the symbol\r\nof his office glitters, and, as monseigneur avers, the worthy D\'Harneim\r\nalways seems tempted to present himself backwards, that his importance\r\nmay at once be seen, felt, and acknowledged."\r\n\r\n"The fact is, that the incessant subject of the count\'s meditations is\r\nto ascertain by what fatal imagination and direction the chamberlain\'s\r\nkey has been placed behind the chamberlain\'s back; for it is related of\r\nhim that he said, with his accustomed good sense, and with a kind of\r\nbitter grief, \'What, the devil! one does not open a door with one\'s\r\nback, at all events!\'"\r\n\r\n"Baron, the courier! the courier!" said Murphy, pointing to the clock.\r\n\r\n"Sad old reprobate, to make me chatter thus! It is your fault. Present\r\nmy respects to his royal highness," said M. de Grauen, taking his hat up\r\nin haste. "And now, adieu till the evening, my dear Murphy."\r\n\r\n"Till the evening, my dear baron, fare thee well. It will be late before\r\nwe meet, for I am sure that monseigneur will go this very day to pay a\r\nvisit to the mysterious house in the Rue du Temple."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nA HOUSE IN THE RUE DU TEMPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to profit by the particulars furnished by Baron de Grauen\r\nrespecting La Goualeuse and Germain, the Schoolmaster\'s son, it became\r\nnecessary for Rodolph to visit the house in the Rue du Temple, formerly\r\nthe abode of that young man, whose retreat the prince likewise hoped to\r\ndiscover through the intervention of Mlle. Rigolette. Although prepared\r\nto find it a difficult task, inasmuch as it was more than probable, if\r\nthe grisette were really sufficiently in Germain\'s confidence to be\r\naware of his present abode, she also knew too well his anxiety to\r\nconceal it to be likely to give the desired information.\r\n\r\nBy renting the chamber lately occupied by the young man, Rodolph,\r\nbesides being on the spot to follow up his researches, considered he\r\nshould also be enabled to observe closely the different individuals\r\ninhabiting the rest of the house.\r\n\r\nThe same day on which the conversation passed between the Baron de Grauen\r\nand Murphy, Rodolph, plainly and unpretendingly dressed, wended his way\r\nabout three o\'clock, on a gloomy November afternoon, towards the Rue du\r\nTemple.\r\n\r\nSituated in a district of much business and dense population, the house\r\nin question had nothing remarkable in its appearance; it was composed of\r\na ground floor, occupied by a man keeping a low sort of dram-shop, and\r\nfour upper stories, surmounted by attics. A dark and narrow alley led\r\nto a small yard, or, rather, a species of square well, of about five or\r\nsix feet in width, completely destitute of either air or light, and\r\nserving as a pestilential receptacle for all the filth thrown by the\r\nvarious occupants of the respective chambers from the unglazed sashes\r\nwith which each landing-place was provided.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of a damp, dismal-looking staircase, a glimmering light\r\nindicated the porter\'s residence, rendered smoky and dingy by the\r\nconstant burning of a lamp, requisite, even at midday, to enlighten the\r\ngloomy hole, into which Rodolph entered for the purpose of asking leave\r\nto view the apartment then vacant.\r\n\r\nA lamp, placed behind a glass globe filled with water, served as a\r\nreflector; and by its light might be seen, at the far end of the "lodge"\r\n(as in courtesy it was styled), a bed, covered with a sort of patchwork\r\ncounterpane, exhibiting a mingled mass of every known colour and\r\nmaterial. A walnut-tree table graced the side of the room, bearing a\r\nvariety of articles suited to the taste and ornamental notions of its\r\nowners. First in order appeared a little waxen Saint John, with a very\r\nfat lamb at his feet, and a large peruke of flowing white curls on his\r\nhead, the whole enclosed in a cracked glass case, the joinings of which\r\nwere ingeniously secured by slips of blue paper; secondly, a pair of old\r\nplated candlesticks, tarnished by time, and bearing, instead of lights,\r\ntwo gilded oranges,--doubtless an offering to the porteress on the last\r\nNew Year\'s day; and, thirdly, two boxes, the one composed of variegated\r\nstraw, the other covered with multitudinous shells, but both smelling\r\nstrongly of the galleys or house of correction[10] (let us hope, for the\r\nsake of the morality of the porteress in the Rue du Temple, that these\r\nprecious specimens were not presented to her from the original owners\r\nand fabricators of them); and, lastly, between the two boxes, and just\r\nbeneath a circular clock, was suspended a pair of red morocco\r\ndress-boots, small enough for the feet of fairies, but elaborately and\r\nskilfully designed and completed. This _chef-d\'oeuvre_, as the ancient\r\nmasters of the craft would style them, joined to the fantastic designs\r\nsketched on the walls representing boots and shoes, abundantly indicated\r\nthat the porter of this establishment devoted his time and his talents\r\nto the repairing of shoes and shoe leather.\r\n\r\n  [10] These boxes were the exclusive manufacture of the criminals\r\n  confined either in the galleys or prisons, and who spent nearly\r\n  all their spare hours in making them.\r\n\r\nAt the instant when Rodolph ventured into the smoky den, M. Pipelet, the\r\nporter, temporarily absent, had left his better half, Madame Pipelet, as\r\nhis representative. This individual was seated by the stove in the\r\ncentre of the lodge, deeply engrossed in watching the boiling of a pot\r\nplaced over it. The description of Madame Pipelet may be given in a few\r\nwords. She was the most ugly, forbidding, wrinkled, toothless old hag\r\none might meet in the course of a long life. Her dress was dirty,\r\ntawdry, and untidy; while her head-dress was composed of a Brutus wig,\r\noriginally of a blond colour, but changed by time into every shade of\r\nred, brown, and yellow, the stiff ends of the perished hair standing out\r\nlike the ears of wheat in a wheat-sheaf. Much did Madame Pipelet pride\r\nherself upon this tasteful covering to her sexagenarian skull; nor was\r\nit believed she ever laid it aside, whether sleeping or waking.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of Rodolph the porteress inquired, in a surly tone:\r\n\r\n"Well, and pray what do you want?"\r\n\r\n"I believe, madame," replied Rodolph, laying a profound emphasis on the\r\nword madame, "I believe there is an apartment to be let in this house?"\r\n\r\nThe deep respect implied in his voice and words somewhat mollified the\r\nporteress, who answered, rather less sourly:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "_This Individual Was Seated by the Stove_"\r\nOriginal Etching by Adrian Marcel]\r\n\r\n"Yes, there is a room to let on the fourth floor, but you cannot see it\r\nnow,--Alfred has gone out."\r\n\r\n"You are speaking of your son, I presume, madame; may I take the liberty\r\nof asking whether he is expected in shortly?"\r\n\r\n"I am not speaking of my son, but my husband. I suppose there is no act\r\nof parliament why my Pipelet should not be called \'Alfred.\' Is there,\r\npray?"\r\n\r\n"None, certainly, madame, that I am aware of; but, with your kind\r\npermission, I will await his return. I am very desirous of taking the\r\nvacant chamber,--both the street and neighbourhood suit me; and the\r\nadmirable order in which the house seems kept pleases me excessively.\r\nBut, previously to viewing the lodging I am anxious to take, I should be\r\nvery glad to ascertain whether you, madame, could do me the favour to\r\ntake the management of my little housekeeping off my hands? I never like\r\nto have any one about me but the authorised housekeeper belonging to the\r\nhouse, when such arrangements meet with their approbation."\r\n\r\nThis proposition, so flatteringly expressed, and the word "housekeeper"\r\ncompletely won Madame Pipelet, who replied:\r\n\r\n"With the greatest of pleasure, sir, I will attend to all you require. I\r\nam sure I shall be proud to wait upon such a gentleman; and, for the\r\nsmall charge of six francs a month, you shall be treated like a prince."\r\n\r\n"Then for six francs a month, I may reckon upon your valuable services.\r\nWill you permit me to ask your name?"\r\n\r\n"Pomona Fortunata Anastasia Pipelet."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, Madame Pipelet, having agreed as to your own terms, will\r\nyou be pleased to tell me those for the apartment I wish to engage?"\r\n\r\n"With the adjoining small closet, one hundred and fifty francs a\r\nmonth,--not a farthing less. The principal lessee is a screw,--a regular\r\nskinflint."\r\n\r\n"What is his name?"\r\n\r\n"M. Bras Rouge."\r\n\r\nThis name, and the remembrances so unexpectedly presented by it, made\r\nRodolph start.\r\n\r\n"I think, Madame Pipelet, you were saying that the principal lessee of\r\nthe house is----"\r\n\r\n"M. Bras Rouge."\r\n\r\n"And he lives----"\r\n\r\n"Rue aux Feves, No. 13. He also keeps an estaminet near the Champs\r\nElysees."\r\n\r\nAll doubt was then at an end,--it was the Bras Rouge of infamous\r\nnotoriety; and singular indeed did the circumstance of thus coming\r\nacross him strike Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"But though M. Bras Rouge is your principal lessee, he is not, I\r\npresume, the owner of the house; may I ask who is?"\r\n\r\n"M. Bourdon; but I have never had communication with any one besides M.\r\nBras Rouge."\r\n\r\nWith the design of still further ingratiating himself with the\r\nporteress, Rodolph resumed:\r\n\r\n"My dear madame, this cold day would make a little of something warm and\r\ncomfortable very acceptable. Might I venture to solicit the favour of\r\nyour stepping as far as the spirit-shop, kept so conveniently at hand,\r\nand bring a bottle of cassia and two glasses? For I feel very tired, and\r\nthe cold has quite seized me. Stay, madame, we will have three glasses,\r\nif you please; because I hope your husband will join us when he\r\nreturns."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he placed a franc in the fat, dirty hand of the porteress.\r\n\r\n"Ah, monsieur, you are determined to make us all fall in love with you!"\r\ncried Madame Pipelet, nodding her approval of the commission, and\r\nthereby sending the flush of pleasure into a face glowing with all the\r\nfiery honours of an excited Bacchante.\r\n\r\n"To be sure! There is nothing like a drop of really good cordial such a\r\nday as this; and they do keep most excellent here at hand. I\'ll go,--of\r\ncourse I will; but I shall only bring a couple of glasses, for Alfred\r\nand I always drink out of the same glass. Poor old darling! he is so\r\nvery nice and particular in showing all those sort of delicate\r\nattentions to women."\r\n\r\n"Then go along, my good Madame Pipelet, and we will wait till Alfred\r\ncomes."\r\n\r\n"But, then, suppose any one wants me whilst I am out, who will mind the\r\nlodge?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ll take care of the lodge."\r\n\r\nThe old woman departed on her agreeable errand.\r\n\r\nAt the termination of a few minutes the postman tapped at the lodge\r\nwindow, and putting his hand into the apartment, presented two letters,\r\nmerely saying, "Three sous."\r\n\r\n"Six sous, you mean, for two letters," replied Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"One is free," answered the man.\r\n\r\nHaving paid and dismissed the postman, Rodolph mechanically examined the\r\ntwo letters thus committed to his charge; but at a further glance they\r\nseemed to him worthy a more attentive observation. The epistle addressed\r\nto Madame Pipelet exhaled through its hot-pressed envelope a strong\r\nodour of Russia leather; it bore, on a seal of red wax, the initials "C.\r\nR." surmounted by a helmet, and supported by a cross of the Legion of\r\nHonour. The direction was written in a firm, bold hand. The heraldic\r\ndevice of the commingled casque and cross made Rodolph smile, and\r\nconfirmed him in the idea that the writer of the letter in question was\r\nnot a female. Who was this scented, emblazoned correspondent of old\r\nAnastasia Pipelet? Rodolph felt an undefinable curiosity to know. The\r\nother epistle, written upon coarse and common paper, was united only by\r\na common wafer, pricked over with the point of a pin, and was addressed\r\nto "M. Cesar Bradamanti, Operating Dentist." Evidently disguised, the\r\nsuperscription was entirely composed of capital letters. Whether founded\r\non a true or false presage, this letter seemed to Rodolph to wear a\r\nmournful look, as though evil or misery were contained within its shabby\r\nfolds. He perceived that some of the letters in the direction were\r\nfainter than the others, and that the paper there seemed a little\r\nrumpled: a tear had evidently fallen upon it.\r\n\r\nMadame Pipelet returned, bearing the bottle of cassia and two glasses.\r\n\r\n"I have dawdled,--have I not, monsieur?" said she, gaily. "But let you\r\nonce get into that good Pere Joseph\'s shop, and it is hard work to get\r\nout again. Oh, that old man is a very insinuating----"\r\n\r\n"Here, madame," interrupted Rodolph, "here are two letters the postman\r\nleft while you were gone."\r\n\r\n"Dear me! Two letters! Pray excuse me, monsieur. I suppose you paid for\r\nthem?"\r\n\r\n"I did."\r\n\r\n"You are very good. I tell you what, then, we will settle that out of\r\nthe first money you have to pay me; how much was it?"\r\n\r\n"Three sous," answered Rodolph, much amused at the ingenious method of\r\nreimbursement employed by Madame Pipelet. "But may I, without offence,\r\nobserve that one of the letters is addressed to you, and that you\r\npossess in the writer a correspondent whose _billets-doux_ are\r\nmarvellously well perfumed?"\r\n\r\n"Let us see what it is about," said the porteress, taking the epistle in\r\nthe scented envelope. "Yes, upon my word, it is scented up like a real\r\n_billet-doux_! Now, I should very much like to know who would dare write\r\n_me_ a love-letter! He must be a villain!"\r\n\r\n"And suppose it had fallen into your husband\'s hands, Madame Pipelet?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, for goodness\' sake don\'t mention that, or I shall faint away in\r\nyour arms! But how stupid I am! Now I know all about it," replied the\r\nfat porteress, shrugging her shoulders. "To be sure! to be sure! it\r\ncomes from the Commandant! Lord bless me, what a fright I have had! for\r\nAlfred is as jealous as a Turk."\r\n\r\n"Here is another letter addressed to M. Cesar Bradamanti."\r\n\r\n"Ah! to be sure, the dentist on the third floor. I will put it in the\r\nletter-boot."\r\n\r\nRodolph fancied he had not caught the right words, but, to his\r\nastonishment, he saw Madame Pipelet gravely throw the letter alluded to\r\ninto an old top-boot hanging up against the wall. He looked at her with\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean," said he at length, "to put the gentleman\'s letter in----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, that is all right," replied the porteress. "I have put it in\r\nthe letter-boot,--there, you see. So now nobody\'s letters can be\r\nmislaid; and when the different lodgers return home, Alfred or myself\r\nturns the boot upside down,--we sort them out, and everybody gets his\r\nown."\r\n\r\nSo saying, the porteress proceeded to break the seal of the letter\r\naddressed to her; which having done, she turned it round and round,\r\nlooked at it in every direction, then, after a short appearance of\r\nembarrassment and uncertainty, she said to Rodolph:\r\n\r\n"Alfred generally reads my letters for me, because I do not happen to be\r\nable to read them myself; perhaps you would not mind just looking over\r\nthis for me?"\r\n\r\n"With the utmost pleasure!" quickly replied Rodolph, curious to dive\r\ninto the mysteries of who Madame Pipelet\'s correspondent might be; and\r\nforthwith he read what follows, written upon hot-pressed paper, stamped\r\nin its right-hand corner with the helmet, the letters "C. R.," the\r\nheraldic supporters, and the cross of honour.\r\n\r\n      "To-morrow (Friday), about eleven o\'clock, let there be a good\r\n    (not an overfierce) fire lighted in both rooms; have everything\r\n    well dusted, and remove the coverings from the furniture, taking\r\n    especial care not to scratch the gilding, or to soil or burn the\r\n    carpet while lighting the fires. If I should not be in about one\r\n    o\'clock, when a lady will arrive in a hackney-coach and inquire\r\n    for me by the name of M. Charles, let her be shown up to the\r\n    apartment; after which the key is to be taken down-stairs again,\r\n    and kept till my arrival."\r\n\r\nSpite of the want of finished composition displayed in this _billet_,\r\nRodolph perfectly comprehended to whom and what it alluded, and merely\r\nadded, after perusing it:\r\n\r\n"Who lives on the first floor, then?"\r\n\r\nThe old woman placed her yellow, shrivelled finger upon her pendulous\r\nlip, and replied, by a half-malicious grin:\r\n\r\n"Hush! There is a woman in the way,--silence!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear Madame Pipelet, I merely asked because, before living in a\r\nhouse, one likes to know a little."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes! Of course, everybody likes to know all they can; that is all\r\nfair enough; and I am sure I have no objection to tell you all I know\r\nmyself, and that is but very little. Well, but to begin. About six weeks\r\nago a carpet-maker came here to look at the first floor, which was then\r\nto let, and to ask the price, and other particulars about it. Next day\r\nhe came again, accompanied by a young man of fair complexion, small\r\nmoustaches, and wearing a cross of honour and very fine linen. The\r\ncarpet-maker called him commandant."\r\n\r\n"A military man, I suppose?" said Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"Military!" exclaimed Madame Pipelet, with a chuckle. "Not he! Why,\r\nAlfred might as well call himself porter to a prince."\r\n\r\n"How so?"\r\n\r\n"Why, he is only in the National Guard! The carpet-maker only called him\r\ncommandant to flatter him: just the same as it tickles up Alfred\'s\r\nvanity to be styled _concierge_ instead of porter. So when the\r\ncommandant (that is the only name we know him by) had looked over the\r\nrooms, he said to the upholsterer, his friend, \'Well, I think the place\r\nwill do for me,--just see the landlord, and arrange all about it.\' \'Yes,\r\ncommandant,\' says the other. And the very next day the upholsterer-man\r\nsigned the lease with M. Bras Rouge (in his own name, mind you); and,\r\nfurther, paid six months in advance, because, he said, the gentleman did\r\nnot wish to be bored about references. And such a power of fine\r\nfurniture as was sent into the first floor! _Sophesus_ (sarcophagus)\r\ncurtains, all silk; glasses set in gold, and everything you can mention,\r\nall beautiful enough to astonish you; just, for all the world, like one\r\nof them grand cafes on the Boulevards! As for the carpets,--oh, you\r\nnever trod on the like of them, I\'ll be bound. Put your foot on them,\r\nand you\'d fancy you was stepping on velvet, and take it off again for\r\nfear of spoiling it. When everything was completed, the commandant came\r\nto look at it,--just to see if he could find out anything more he\r\nwanted; but he could not. So then he spoke to Alfred, and says he,\r\n\'Could you take charge of my rooms and keep them in nice order, light\r\nfires from time to time, and get them ready for me when I wish to occupy\r\nthem? I shall not be here often,\' says he, \'and would always write you a\r\nline before coming, to give you time to prepare them.\' \'Yes, commandant,\r\nI can,\' answers my flatterer of an Alfred. \'And what shall you charge?\'\r\n\'Twenty francs a month, commandant.\' \'Twenty francs!\' exclaimed the\r\ncommandant. \'Why, porter, you are jesting, surely!\' And hereupon he\r\nbegan bating Alfred down in the most shabby manner, trying to squeeze\r\npoor people like us out of two or three miserable francs, when he had\r\nbeen squandering thousands in fitting up his grand apartments, which,\r\nafter all, he did not mean to live in! However, after a deal of\r\nbattling, we got twelve francs a month out of him,--a paltry, pitiful,\r\ntwo-farthing captain! What a difference, now, between you and him!"\r\nadded the porteress, addressing Rodolph with an admiring glance. "You\r\ndon\'t call yourself fine names and titles,--you only look like a plain\r\nbody,--you must be poor, or you would not perch yourself on the fourth\r\nfloor; and yet you agreed with me for six francs, without attempting to\r\nbate me down!"\r\n\r\n"And when did the commandant pay you his next visit?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you,--and good fun it is, too. My gentleman must have been\r\nnicely choused by somebody. Three times did he write (same as to-day),\r\nordering us to light a fire and have everything ready for the reception\r\nof a lady he expected would come. Come! Yes, I daresay he may expect a\r\nlong time first, I rather think."\r\n\r\n"Nobody came then?"\r\n\r\n"Listen. The first time the commandant arrived, strutting and swelling\r\nlike a turkey-cock, humming and singing, after his manner, all the gay\r\ntunes of the day, walking up and down his fine room with his hands stuck\r\nin his pockets, and occasionally stopping to arrange his hair before the\r\nglass,--we were watching him all the time. Well, this went on for two or\r\nthree hours, when, I suppose, he knew it was no use waiting any longer;\r\nso he came down-stairs very softly, and with quite a different manner to\r\nthe pride and consequence he had marched up with. By way of teasing him,\r\nPipelet and I went out to him and said, \'Commandant, there has been no\r\nlady whatever to inquire for you,\' \'Very well! Very well!\' exclaimed he,\r\nhalf mad and half ashamed of being laughed at, and, buttoning up his\r\ncoat, he walked off as fast as he could. The next time, before he came\r\nhimself, a small note was brought here by a man, directed to M. Charles;\r\nI strongly suspected he was done again, and Pipelet and me were enjoying\r\na hearty good laugh over it when the commandant arrived. \'Captain,\'\r\nsays I, putting the back of my hand up to my wig, by way of military\r\nsalute, \'here is a letter for you, but I am afraid it contains news of a\r\nsecond countermarch against you.\' He looked at me sour as a crab,\r\nsnatched the letter from my hand, read it, turned scarlet as a boiled\r\nlobster, then walked off, pretending to whistle; but he was finely\r\nvexed,--ready to hang himself, I could see he was,--and it was rare nuts\r\nto me. \'Go, and swallow that pill, my two-farthing captain,\' says I to\r\nmyself; \'that serves you right for only giving twelve francs a month for\r\nminding your apartments.\'"\r\n\r\n"And the third time?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, the third time I really thought it was all right. The commandant\r\narrived more stuck up with pride than ever; his eyes staring with\r\nself-satisfied admiration at himself and the certainty of not being\r\ndisappointed this time. Let me tell the truth about him; he really is a\r\ngood-looking man, and dresses well, though he stinks of musk like a\r\ncivet cat. Well, there was my gentleman arrayed in all his finery, and\r\nscarcely condescending to look at us poor folks; he seemed as though he\r\nconferred a favour on the earth by deigning to walk on it, and went,\r\nsticking his nose into the air, as if he meant to touch the clouds with\r\nit. He took the key, and said to us, as he passed up-stairs, in a\r\njeering, self-complacent tone, as though to revenge himself for having\r\nbeen laughed at twice before, \'You will direct the lady to my apartments\r\nwhen she comes.\' Well, Pipelet and I were so anxious to see the lady he\r\nexpected, though we did not much reckon upon her keeping her\r\nappointment, even if she ever made one, that we went and hid ourselves\r\nbehind the little door that belongs to the alley; and, behold! in a\r\nshort time a blue hackney-coach, with its blinds drawn down, stopped at\r\nthe entrance to the house. \'There she is!\' says I to Alfred. \'There is\r\nhis madame; let\'s keep back a bit for fear we frighten her away.\' The\r\ncoachman got off his box and opened the door. Then we saw a female,\r\nclosely covered with a black veil, and carrying a muff; she had\r\napparently been crying, for she kept her handkerchief to her face; for\r\nwhen the steps were let down, instead of alighting, she said some few\r\nwords to the driver, who, much surprised, shut the door up again."\r\n\r\n"Then the lady did not get out?"\r\n\r\n"No! she threw herself back in the coach and pressed her handkerchief\r\ntightly to her eyes. I rushed out, and before the coachman had time to\r\nget on his seat again, I called out, \'Hallo, there, coachy! are you\r\ngoing back again?\' \'Yes,\' says he. \'Where?\' says I. \'Where I came from,\'\r\nanswers he. \'And where did you come from?\' asks I again. \'From the Rue\r\nSt. Dominique, corner of the Rue Belle Chasse.\'"\r\n\r\nRodolph started at these words. His dearest friend, the Marquis\r\nd\'Harville, who, as elsewhere stated, had been for some time labouring\r\nunder a deep melancholy none could penetrate, lived in the very place\r\njust mentioned by Madame Pipelet. Could this mysterious female in the\r\nblue _fiacre_ be the Marquise d\'Harville? And was it from the lightness\r\nand frivolity of her conduct that the mind of her excellent husband was\r\nbowed down by doubts and misgivings? These painful suggestions crowded\r\non Rodolph\'s mind, but, although well acquainted with all the various\r\nguests received by the marquise, he could recollect no one answering the\r\ndescription of the commandant; added to which, any female might have\r\ntaken a hackney-coach from that spot without necessarily living in the\r\nstreet. There was really nothing to identify the unknown of the blue\r\n_fiacre_ with Madame d\'Harville, and yet a thousand vague fears and\r\npainful suspicions crossed his mind; his uneasy manner and deep\r\nabstraction did not escape the porteress.\r\n\r\n"What are you thinking of, sir?" asked she at length.\r\n\r\n"I was wondering what could have induced the lady, after coming to the\r\nvery door, to change her mind so suddenly."\r\n\r\n"There is no saying; some sudden thought,--dread or fear,--for we poor\r\nwomen are but weak, cowardly things," said the porteress, assuming a\r\ntimid, frightened manner. "Well, I think if it had been myself now,\r\ncoming secretly to visit Alfred, I should have had to try back a great\r\nmany times before I could have screwed up my courage to venture in. But\r\nthen, as for visiting your great dons in this kind of way, I never could\r\nhave done such a thing. No, never! I am sure there is nobody under the\r\nface of heaven can say I ever give them the least freedom,--I should\r\nthink not, indeed, while my poor dear old darling of a husband is left."\r\n\r\n"No doubt,--no doubt, Madame Pipelet; but about the young person you\r\nwere describing in the blue _fiacre_?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! mind, I don\'t know whether she was young or old; I could not even\r\ncatch a glimpse of the tip of her nose; all I can say is she went as she\r\ncame, and that is all about it. As for Alfred and me, we were better\r\npleased than if we had found ten francs."\r\n\r\n"Why so?"\r\n\r\n"By enjoying the rage and confusion of the commandant when he found\r\nhimself a third time disappointed; but, instead of going and telling him\r\nat once that his \'madame\' had been and gone, we allowed him to fume and\r\nfret for a whole hour. Then I went softly up-stairs with only my list\r\nslippers on. I reached his door, which I found half shut; as I pushed\r\nagainst it, it creaked; the staircase is as black as night, and the\r\nentrance to the apartment quite as obscure. Scarcely had I crept into\r\nthe room, when the commandant caught me in his arms, saying, in a\r\nlanguishing voice, \'My dearest angel! what makes you so late?\'"\r\n\r\nSpite of the serious nature of the thoughts crowding upon his mind,\r\nRodolph could not restrain a smile as he surveyed the grotesque periwig\r\nand hideously wrinkled, carbuncled visage of the heroine of this comic\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nMadame Pipelet, however, resumed her narration with a mirthful chuckle\r\nthat increased her ugliness:\r\n\r\n"That was a go, wasn\'t it? But stop a bit. Well, I did not make the\r\nleast reply, but, almost keeping in my breath, I waited to see what\r\nwould be the end of this strange reception. For a minute or two the\r\ncommandant kept hugging me up, then, all of a sudden, the brute pushed\r\nme away, exclaiming with as much disgust as though he had touched a\r\ntoad, \'Who the devil are you?\' \'Me, commandant,--the porteress,--Madame\r\nPipelet; and, as such, I will thank you to keep your hands off my waist,\r\nand not to call me your angel, and scold me for being late. Suppose\r\nAlfred had heard you, a pretty business we should have made of it!\'\r\n\'What the deuce brings you here?\' cried he. \'Merely to let you know the\r\nlady in the hackney-coach has just arrived!\' \'Well, then, you stupid old\r\nfool, show her up directly. Did I not tell you to do so?\' \'Yes,\r\ncommandant; you said I was to show her up.\' \'Then why do you not obey\r\nme?\' \'Because the lady--\' \'Speak out, woman, if you can!\' \'The lady has\r\ngone again.\' \'Something you have said or done, then, to offend her, I am\r\nsure!\' roared he in a perfect fury. \'Not at all, commandant. The lady\r\ndid not alight, but when the coach stopped and the driver opened the\r\ndoor, she desired him to take her back to where she came from.\' \'The\r\nvehicle cannot have got far by this time,\' exclaimed the commandant,\r\nhastening towards the door. \'It has been gone upwards of an hour,\'\r\nanswered I, enjoying his fury and disappointment. \'An hour! an hour! and\r\nwhat, in the devil\'s name, hindered you from letting me know this\r\nsooner?\' \'Because, commandant, Alfred and I thought we would spare you\r\nas long as we could the tidings of this third breakdown, which we\r\nfancied might be too much for you.\' Come, thinks I, there is something\r\nto make you remember flinging me out of your arms, as though it made you\r\nsick to touch me. \'Begone!\' bawled out the commandant. \'You hideous old\r\nhag! You can neither say nor do the thing that is right,\' and with this\r\nhe pulled off his dressing-gown and threw his beautiful Greek cap, made\r\nof velvet embroidered with gold, on the ground: it was a real shame, for\r\nthe cap was a downright beauty; and as for the dressing-gown, oh, my! it\r\nwould set anybody longing. Meanwhile the commandant kept pacing the\r\nroom, with his eyes glaring like a wild beast and glowing like two\r\nglow-worms."\r\n\r\n"But were you not afraid of losing his employ?"\r\n\r\n"He knew too well what he was about for that; we had him in a fix, we\r\nknew where his \'madame\' lived, and had he said anything to us, we should\r\nhave threatened to expose the whole affair. And who do you think for his\r\nbeggarly twelve francs would have undertaken to attend to his rooms,--a\r\nstranger? No! That we would have prevented; we would soon have made the\r\nplace too hot to hold any person he might appoint,--poor, shabby fellow\r\nthat he is! What do you think? He actually had the meanness to examine\r\nhis wood and put out the quantity he should allow to be burnt while he\r\nwas away. He is nothing but an upstart, I am sure,--a nobody, who has\r\nsuddenly tumbled into money he does not know how to spend properly,--a\r\nrich man\'s head and a beggar\'s body, who squanders with one hand and\r\nnips and pinches with the other. I do not wish him any harm, but it\r\namuses me immensely to think how he has been befooled; and he will go on\r\nbelieving and expecting from day to day, because he is too vain to\r\nimagine he is being laughed at. At any rate, if the lady ever comes in\r\nreality, I will let my friend the oyster-woman next door know; she\r\nenjoys a joke as well as I do, and is quite as curious as myself to find\r\nout what sort of person she is, whether fair or dark, pretty or plain.\r\nAnd--who knows?--this woman may be cheating some easygoing simpleton of\r\na husband for the sake of our two-penny-halfpenny of a commandant! Well,\r\nthat is no concern of mine, but I am sorry, too, for the poor, dear,\r\ndeceived individual, whoever he may be. Dear me! Dear me! My pot is\r\nboiling over,--excuse me a minute, I must just look to it. Ah, it is\r\ntime Alfred was in, for dinner is quite ready, and tripe, you know,\r\nshould never be kept waiting. This tripe is done to a turn. Do you\r\nprefer the thick or thin tripe? Alfred likes it thick. The poor darling\r\nhas been sadly out of spirits lately, and I got this dainty dish to\r\ncheer him up a bit; for, as Alfred says himself, that for a bribe of\r\ngood thick tripe he would betray France itself,--his beloved France.\r\nYes, the dear old pet would change his country for such fine fat tripe\r\nas this, he would."\r\n\r\nWhile Madame Pipelet was thus delivering her domestic harangue upon the\r\nvirtues of tripe and the powerful influence it possessed over even the\r\npatriotism of her husband, Rodolph was buried in the deepest and most\r\nsombre reflections. The female, whose visits to the house had just been\r\ndetailed, be she the Marquise d\'Harville or any other individual, had\r\nevidently long struggled with her imprudence ere she had brought herself\r\nto grant a first and second rendezvous, and then, terrified at the\r\nprobable consequences of her imprudence, a salutary remorse had, in all\r\nprobability, prevented her from fulfilling her dangerous engagement. It\r\nmight be that the fine person this M. Charles was described as\r\npossessing had captivated the senses of Madame d\'Harville, whom Rodolph\r\nknew well as a woman of deep feeling, high intellect, and superior\r\ntaste, of an elevated turn of mind, and a reputation unsullied by the\r\nfaintest breath of slander. After long and mature consideration, he\r\nsucceeded in persuading himself that the wife of his friend had nothing\r\nto do with the unknown female in the blue _fiacre_. Madame Pipelet,\r\nhaving completed her culinary arrangements, resumed her conversation\r\nwith Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"And who lives on the second floor?" inquired he of the porteress.\r\n\r\n"Why, Mother Burette does,--a most wonderful woman at fortune-telling;\r\nbless you, she can read in your hand the same as a book, and many quite\r\nfirst-rate people come to her to have the cards consulted when they are\r\nanxious about any particular matter. She earns her weight in gold, and\r\nthat is not a trifle, for she is a rare bundle of an old body. However,\r\ntelling fortunes is only one of her means of gaining a livelihood."\r\n\r\n"Why, what does she do besides?"\r\n\r\n"She keeps what you would call a pawnbroker\'s shop upon a small scale."\r\n\r\n"I see; your second-floor lodger lends out again the money she derives\r\nfrom her skill in foretelling events by reading the cards."\r\n\r\n"Exactly so; only she is cheaper and more easy to deal with than the\r\nregular pawnbrokers: she does not confuse you with a heap of paper\r\ntickets and duplicates,--nothing of the sort. Now suppose: Some one\r\nbrings Mother Burette a shirt worth three francs; well, she lends ten\r\nsous upon condition of being paid twenty at the end of the week,\r\notherwise she keeps the shirt for ever. That is simple enough, is it\r\nnot? Always in round figures, you see,--a child could understand it. And\r\nthe odd things she has brought her as pledges you would scarcely\r\nbelieve. You can hardly guess what she sometimes is asked to lend upon.\r\nI saw her once advance money upon a gray parrot that swore like a\r\ntrooper,--the blackguard did."\r\n\r\n"A parrot? But to what amount did she advance money?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you; the parrot was well known; it belonged to a Madame\r\nHerbelot, the widow of a factor, living close by, and it was also well\r\nunderstood that Madame Herbelot valued the parrot as much as she did her\r\nlife. Well, Mother Burette said to her, \'I will lend you ten francs on\r\nyour bird, but if by this day week at twelve o\'clock I do not receive\r\ntwenty francs with interest (it would amount to that in round numbers),\r\nif I am not paid my twenty francs, with the expenses of his keep, I\r\nshall give your Polly a trifling dose of arsenic mixed with his food.\'\r\nShe knew her customer well, bless you! However, by this threat Mother\r\nBurette received her twenty francs at the end of seven days, and Madame\r\nHerbelot got back her disagreeable, screaming parrot."\r\n\r\n"Mother Burette has no other way of living besides the two you have\r\nnamed, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Not that I know of. I don\'t know, however, what to say of some rather\r\nsly and secret transactions, carried on in a small room she never allows\r\nany one to enter, except M. Bras Rouge and an old one-eyed woman, called\r\nLa Chouette."\r\n\r\nRodolph opened his eyes with unmixed astonishment as these names sounded\r\non his ear, and the porteress, interpreting the surprise of her future\r\nlodger according to her own notions, said:\r\n\r\n"That name would make any one stare with astonishment. Certainly La\r\nChouette is uncommonly odd; is it not?"\r\n\r\n"It is, indeed. Does the woman who is so styled come here frequently?"\r\n\r\n"We saw her the day before yesterday, for the first time these six\r\nweeks. She was rather lame, I observed."\r\n\r\n"And what do you suppose she wants with the fortune-telling woman?"\r\n\r\n"That I do not know; at least, as to what takes place in the little room\r\nI was telling you of, where La Chouette alone is admitted with M. Bras\r\nRouge and Mother Burette. I have, however, particularly observed that on\r\nthose occasions the one-eyed woman always has a large bundle with her\r\nin her basket, and that M. Bras Rouge also carries a parcel of some size\r\nbeneath his cloak, and that they always return empty-handed."\r\n\r\n"And what can these packets contain?"\r\n\r\n"The Lord above knows, for I don\'t; only they kick up the devil\'s own\r\nrow with them, whatever they are. And then such whiffs of sulphur,\r\ncharcoal, and melted lead, as you go up the stairs; and blow, blow,\r\nblow, like a smith\'s forge. I verily believe Mother Burette has dealings\r\nwith the old one, and practises magic in this private apartment;\r\nleastways, that is what M. Cesar Bradamanti, our third-floor lodger,\r\nsaid to me. A very clever individual is M. Cesar. When I say an\r\n\'individual,\' I mean an Italian, though he speaks as good French as you\r\nor me, excepting his accent, and that is nothing. Oh, he is very clever,\r\nindeed! knows all about physic; and pulls out teeth, not for the sake of\r\nthe money but the honour of his profession,--yes, really, sir, for\r\ndownright honour. Now, suppose you had six decayed teeth,--and he says\r\nthe same thing to all who choose to listen to him,--well, then he will\r\ntake out five for nothing, and only charge you for the sixth. Besides\r\nwhich, he sells all manner of remedies for all sorts of\r\ncomplaints,--diseases of the lungs, coughs, colds, every complaint you\r\ncan name; but then he makes his own drugs, and he has for his assistant\r\nthe son of our principal lessee, little Tortillard. He says that his\r\nmaster is going to buy himself a horse and a red coat, and to sell his\r\ndrugs in the market-places, and that young Tortillard is to be dressed\r\nlike a page and be at the drum, to attract customers."\r\n\r\n"This seems to me a very humble occupation for the son of your principal\r\nlessee."\r\n\r\n"Why, his father says unless he gets a pretty strong hand over him, and\r\na tolerably powerful taste of whipcord, in the way of a sound thrashing,\r\nevery now and then, he is safe to come to the scaffold. And he is about\r\nthe ugliest, most spiteful, ill-disposed young rascal one would wish to\r\nmeet: he has played more than one abominable trick upon poor M. Cesar\r\nBradamanti, who is the best creature possible; for he cured Alfred of a\r\nrheumatic attack, and I promise you we have not forgotten it. Yet there\r\nare some people wicked enough to--But no, I will not tell you: it would\r\nmake the hair of your head stand on end. As Alfred says, if it were\r\ntrue, it would send him to the galleys."\r\n\r\n"Why, what do they accuse him of?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I really cannot tell you! I can\'t, indeed; for it is so--"\r\n\r\n"Then we will drop the subject."\r\n\r\n"And to say such things of a young man! Upon my life and soul, it is too\r\nbad."\r\n\r\n"Pray, Madame Pipelet, do not give yourself the trouble of saying any\r\nmore about it: let us speak of other matters."\r\n\r\n"Why, I don\'t know but, as you are to live in the house, it is only fair\r\nand right to prepare you for any falsehoods you may hear. I suppose you\r\nare sufficiently well off to make the acquaintance of M. Cesar\r\nBradamanti, and unless you are put on your guard against these reports,\r\nthey might lead to your breaking off with him. So, just put your ear\r\ndown and I\'ll whisper what it is people say about him."\r\n\r\nAnd the old woman, in a low tone, muttered a few words as Rodolph\r\ninclined his head; he started from her, with mingled disgust and horror.\r\n\r\n"Impossible!" exclaimed he. "Surely human nature is not capable of such\r\ncrimes!"\r\n\r\n"Shocking! Is it not? But treat it as I do,--all scandal and lies. What,\r\ndo you think the man who cured Alfred\'s rheumatism,--who draws five\r\nteeth out of six for nothing,--who has testimonies (testimonials) from\r\nevery prince and king in the world,--and, above all, pays as he goes,\r\ndown on the nail, would go for to do such things? Not he! I\'ll stake my\r\nblessed life upon it."\r\n\r\nWhile Madame Pipelet thus vented her indignant opinion concerning the\r\nreports in circulation, Rodolph recalled to his memory the letter he had\r\nseen addressed to the quack dentist; he remembered the counterfeited\r\nwriting and the coarse, common paper, stained with tears, which had\r\nwell-nigh obliterated part of the address,--too well did he see in the\r\nmysterious grief-stained epistle the opening of a drama of deep and\r\nfearful import; and while these sad presages filled his mind, a powerful\r\nimpression whispered within him that the dreadful doings ascribed to the\r\nItalian were not altogether unfounded.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I declare, here comes Alfred!" exclaimed the porteress. "Now he\r\nwill tell you his opinion of all these spiteful stories about poor M.\r\nBradamanti. Bless you! Alfred thinks him as innocent as a lamb, ever\r\nsince he cured his rheumatics."\r\n\r\nM. Pipelet entered the lodge with a grave, magisterial air. He was about\r\nsixty years of age, comfortably fat, with a large, broad countenance,\r\nstrongly resembling in its cast and style the faces carved upon the\r\nfar-famed nutcrackers of Nuremberg; a nose, of more than ordinary\r\nproportions, helping to complete the likeness. An old and dingy-looking\r\nhat, with a very deep brim, surmounted the whole. Alfred, who adhered to\r\nthis upper ornament as tenaciously as his wife did to her Brutus wig,\r\nwas further attired in an ancient green coat, with immense flaps turned\r\nup with grease,--if so might be described the bright and shiny patches\r\nof long-accumulated dirt, which had given an entirely different hue to\r\nsome portions of the garment. But, though clad in a hat and coat\r\nesteemed by Pipelet and his wife as closely resembling full dress,\r\nAlfred had not laid aside the modest emblem of his trade, but from his\r\nwaist uprose the buff-coloured triangular front of his leathern apron,\r\npartly concealing a waistcoat boasting nearly as great a variety of\r\ncolours as did the patchwork counterpane of Madame Pipelet.\r\n\r\nThe porter\'s recognition of Rodolph as he entered was gracious in the\r\nextreme; but, alas! he smiled a melancholy welcome, and his countenance\r\nand languid air marked a man of secret sorrow.\r\n\r\n"Alfred," said Madame Pipelet, when she had introduced her two\r\ncompanions, "here is a gentleman after the apartment on the fourth\r\nfloor, and we have only been waiting for you to drink a glass of cordial\r\nhe sent for."\r\n\r\nThis delicate attention won for Rodolph the entire trust and confidence\r\nof the melancholy porter, who, touching the brim of his hat, said, in a\r\ndeep bass voice worthy of being employed in a cathedral:\r\n\r\n"We shall give the gentleman every satisfaction as porters, and,\r\ndoubtless, he will act the same by us as a lodger; \'birds of a feather\r\nflock together,\' as the proverb says." Then, interrupting himself, M.\r\nPipelet anxiously added, "Providing, sir, you are not a painter!"\r\n\r\n"No, I am not a painter, but a plain merchant\'s clerk."\r\n\r\n"My most humble duty to you, sir. I congratulate you that Nature did not\r\nmake you one of those monsters called artists."\r\n\r\n"Artists, monsters!" returned Rodolph. "Tell me, pray, why you style\r\nthem so."\r\n\r\nInstead of replying, M. Pipelet elevated his clasped hands towards the\r\nceiling, and allowed a heavy sound, between a grunt and a groan, to\r\nescape his overcharged breast.\r\n\r\n"You must know, sir," said Madame Pipelet, in a low tone, to Rodolph,\r\n"that painters have embittered Alfred\'s life; they have worried my poor\r\nold dear almost out of his senses, and made him half stupefied, as you\r\nsee him now." Then speaking loud, she added, in a caressing tone, "Oh,\r\nnever mind the blackguard, there\'s a dear, but try and forget all about\r\nit, or you will be ill, and unable to eat the nice tripe I have got for\r\nyour dinner."\r\n\r\n"Let us hope I shall have courage and firmness enough for all things,"\r\nreplied M. Pipelet, with a dignified and resigned air; "but he has done\r\nme much harm; he has been my persecutor, almost my executioner,--long\r\nhave I suffered, but now I despise him! Ah," said he, turning to\r\nRodolph, "never allow a painter to enter your doors; they are the\r\nplague--the ruin--the destruction of a house!"\r\n\r\n"You have, then, had a painter lodging with you, I presume?"\r\n\r\n"Unhappily, sir, I did have one," replied M. Pipelet, with much\r\nbitterness, "and that one named Cabrion. Ah!"\r\n\r\nAt the recollections brought back by this name, the porter\'s declaration\r\nof courage and endurance utterly failed him, and again his clenched\r\nfists were raised, as though to invoke the vengeance he had so lately\r\ndescribed himself as despising.\r\n\r\n"And was this individual the last occupant of the chamber I am about\r\nengaging?" inquired Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"No, no! The last lodger was an excellent young man named M. Germain.\r\nNo, this Cabrion had the room before he came. Ah, sir, since Cabrion\r\nleft, he has all but driven me stark staring mad!"\r\n\r\n"Did you, then, so much regret him?" asked Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"Regret him! Regret Cabrion!" screamed the astounded porter; "why, only\r\nimagine, M. Bras Rouge paid him two quarters\' rent to induce him to quit\r\nthe place, for, unluckily, he had taken his apartments for a term. What\r\na scamp he was! You have no idea of the horrible tricks he played off\r\nupon all the lodgers as well as us. Why, just to give you one little\r\nproof of his villainy, there was hardly a single wind instrument he did\r\nnot make use of as a sort of annoyance to the lodgers; from the French\r\nhorn to the flageolet, he made use of all, and even carried his\r\nrascality so far as to play false and to keep blowing the same note for\r\nhours together; it was enough to worry one out of one\'s senses. Well, I\r\nsuppose there were upwards of twenty different petitions sent to our\r\nchief lessee, M. Bras Rouge, to turn the beggar out; and, at last, he\r\nwas only got rid of by paying him two quarters\' rent,--rather droll, is\r\nit not, for a landlord to pay his lodger? But, bless you, the house was\r\nso upset by him that he might have had any price so he would but take\r\nhimself off; however, he _did_ go. And now you suppose we were clear of\r\nM. Cabrion? I\'ll tell you. Next night, about eleven o\'clock, I was in\r\nbed, when rap, rap, rap, comes to the gate. I pulls up the\r\nstring,--somebody walks up to my door, \'How do you do, porter?\' says a\r\nvoice; \'will you oblige me with a lock of your hair?\' \'Somebody has\r\nmistaken the door,\' says my wife. So I calls out to the stranger, \'You\r\nare wrong, friend, you want next door.\' \'I think not,\' returns the\r\nvoice; \'this is No. 17, is it not, and the porter\'s name is Pipelet? I\'m\r\nall right; so please to open the door and oblige me with a lock of your\r\nbeautiful hair.\' \'My name is Pipelet, certainly,\' answers I. \'Well,\r\nthen, friend Pipelet, Cabrion has sent me for a piece of your hair; he\r\nsays he must and he will have it.\'"\r\n\r\nAs Pipelet uttered the last words he gave his head a mournful shake,\r\nand, folding his arms, assumed an attitude of martyrlike resolution.\r\n\r\n"Do you perceive, sir? He sends to me, his mortal enemy, whom he\r\noverwhelmed with insults and continually outraged in every way, to beg a\r\nlock of my hair,--a favour which even ladies have been known to refuse\r\nto a lover!"\r\n\r\n"But, supposing this Cabrion had been as good a lodger as was M.\r\nGermain," replied Rodolph, with some difficulty preserving the gravity\r\nof countenance, "do you think you might have accorded him the favour?"\r\n\r\n"Not to the best lodger that treads shoe-leather would I grant a similar\r\nrequest," replied the man in the flapped hat, waving it majestically\r\nover his brows as he spoke; "it is contrary to my principles and habits\r\nto give my hair to any one,--only I should have refused with the most\r\nscrupulous regard to politeness."\r\n\r\n"That is not all," chimed in the porteress. "Only conceive, sir, the\r\nabominable conduct of that Cabrion, who, from morning to night, at all\r\nhours and at all times, sends a swarm of vagabonds like himself to ask\r\nAlfred for a lock of his hair,--always for Cabrion!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, monsieur," sighed out poor Pipelet, "had I committed the most\r\natrocious crimes, my sleep could not have been rendered more broken and\r\nunrefreshing; scarcely do I fall into a doze than I wake starting with\r\nthe idea of being called by that cursed Cabrion! I suspect\r\neverybody,--in each person who approaches me I see an emissary from my\r\npersecutor come to request a lock of my hair. I am losing my good\r\nspirits, my temper, and becoming gloomy, suspicious, peevish, and\r\nill-natured. This infernal Cabrion has murdered my whole life!"\r\n\r\nAnd Pipelet heaved so profound a sigh that his hat, vibrating for some\r\ntime from the consequences of the convulsive shake of the head\r\noccasioned thereby, fell forward and completely veiled his care-stricken\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\n"I can well understand, now," said Rodolph, "that you are not\r\nparticularly partial to painters; but I suppose the M. Germain you were\r\npraising so highly made up for the bad treatment you received from M.\r\nCabrion?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, sir; as I told you, M. Germain was a delightful young man, so\r\nhonourable and kind-hearted, open as the day, and ever ready to serve\r\nand oblige; he was cheerful and merry as need be, but then he always\r\nkept his high spirits within proper bounds instead of worrying people to\r\ndeath by his unmeaning hoaxes, like that Cabrion, who I wish was at the\r\ndevil!"\r\n\r\n"Come, come, my good M. Pipelet, I must not let you thus excite\r\nyourself; and who, now, is the person fortunate enough to possess such a\r\npattern of a lodger as this M. Germain seems to have been?"\r\n\r\n"That is more than I can tell you; no one knows whither he has gone, nor\r\nare they likely, except, indeed, through Mlle. Rigolette."\r\n\r\n"And who is Mlle. Rigolette?" demanded Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"Why, she is a needlewoman, also living on the fourth floor," cried\r\nMadame Pipelet; "another pattern lodger, always pays her rent in\r\nadvance, and keeps her little chamber so nice and clean; then she is\r\nwell behaved to every one, so merry and happy, like a bird, though, poor\r\nthing! very like a caged bird, obliged to work early and late to earn\r\ntwo francs a day, and often not half that, let her try ever so hard."\r\n\r\n"How does it happen that Mlle. Rigolette should be the only person\r\nentrusted with the secret of M. Germain\'s present abode?"\r\n\r\n"Why, when he was going away, he came to us and said," returned Madame\r\nPipelet, "\'I do not expect any letters; but if, by chance, any should\r\ncome, please to give them to Mlle. Rigolette.\' And she is well worthy of\r\nhis confidence, if his letters were filled with gold; don\'t you think\r\nso, Alfred?"\r\n\r\n"The fact is," said the porter, in a severe tone, "that I know no harm\r\nof Mlle. Rigolette, excepting her permitting herself to be wheedled over\r\nby that vile scamp, Cabrion."\r\n\r\n"But you know, Alfred, that nothing more than a few harmless attentions\r\npassed between them," interrupted the porteress; "for, though Mlle.\r\nRigolette is as merry as a kitten, she is as prudent and correct as I am\r\nmyself. You should see the strong bolts she has inside her door; and if\r\nher next-door neighbour will make love to her, that is not her fault; it\r\nfollows as a matter of course when people are so close to each other.\r\nIt was just the same with the travelling-clerk we had here before\r\nCabrion, and so it was when M. Germain took the room this abominable\r\npainter occupied. So, as I say, there is no blame to Mlle. Rigolette; it\r\narises out of the two rooms joining one another so closely,--naturally\r\nthat brings about a little flirtation, but nothing more."\r\n\r\n"So, then, it becomes a matter of course, does it," said Rodolph, "that\r\nevery one who occupies the apartment I am to have should make love to\r\nMlle. Rigolette?"\r\n\r\n"Why, of course, monsieur; how can you be good neighbours without\r\nit,--don\'t you see? Now, imagine yourself lodging in the very next room\r\nto a nice, pretty, obliging young person, like Mlle. Rigolette; well,\r\nthen, young people will be young people,--sometimes you want a light,\r\nsometimes a few live coals to kindle up your fire, maybe a little\r\nwater,--for one is sure always to find plenty of fresh spring water at\r\nMlle. Rigolette\'s, she is never without it; it is her only luxury,--she\r\nis like a little duck, always dabbling in it; and if she does happen to\r\nhave a little leisure, such a washing down of floors and cleaning of\r\nwindows! Never the least soil or neglect about either herself or her\r\napartment, and so you will find."\r\n\r\n"And so M. Germain, by reason of his close proximity to Mlle. Rigolette,\r\nbecame what you style upon perfectly neighbourly terms with her?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, bless you, yes! Why, the two seemed cut out for each other, so\r\nyoung and so good-looking! It was quite a pleasure to look at them as\r\nthey came down-stairs of a Sunday to take the only walk, poor things!\r\nthey could afford themselves throughout the week; she dressed in a smart\r\nlittle cap and a gown that cost, probably, not more than twenty-five\r\nsous the ell, but made by herself, and that so tastily that it became\r\nher as much as though it had been of satin; he, mind ye, dressed and\r\nlooking like a regular gentleman."\r\n\r\n"And M. Germain has not been to see Mlle. Rigolette, I suppose, since he\r\nquitted the house?"\r\n\r\n"No, monsieur; unless on Sunday, for Mlle. Rigolette has no time during\r\nthe other six days of the week to think of sweethearting. Why, the poor\r\ngirl rises at five or six o\'clock, and works incessantly till ten or\r\neleven o\'clock at night, never once leaving her room except for a few\r\nminutes in the morning, when she goes out to buy food for herself and\r\nher two canary-birds; and the three eat but very little, just a\r\npenn\'orth of milk, a little bread, some chickweed, bird-seed, and clear\r\nfresh water, and the whole three of them sing away as merrily as though\r\nthey fared ever so sumptuously. And Mlle. Rigolette is kind and\r\ncharitable, too, as far as lies in her power; that is to say, she gives\r\nher time, her sleep, and her services; for, poor girl! she can scarcely\r\nmanage to keep herself by working closely for twelve hours a day. Those\r\npoor, unfortunate creatures in the attics, whom M. Bras Rouge is going\r\nto turn into the streets in two or three days\' time, if even he wait so\r\nlong,--why, Mlle. Rigolette and M. Germain sat up with the children\r\nnight after night!"\r\n\r\n"You have a distressed family, then, here?"\r\n\r\n"Distressed! Oh, God bless you, my good sir, I think we have, indeed.\r\nWhy, there are five young children, an almost dying mother, an idiotic\r\ngrandmother, and their only support a man who, though he slaves like a\r\nnegro, cannot even get bread enough to eat,--and a capital workman he\r\nis, too; three hours\' sleep out of the twenty-four is all he allows\r\nhimself,--and what sleep it is! broken by his children crying for food,\r\nby the groans of his sick wife tossing on her miserable straw bed, or\r\nthe idiotic screams of the poor bedridden old grandmother, who sometimes\r\nhowls like a wolf,--from hunger, too,--for, poor creature! she has not\r\nsense or reason to know better, and when she gets very hungry you may\r\nhear cries and screams all down the staircase."\r\n\r\n"Horrible!" exclaimed Rodolph, with a shudder; "and does no one afford\r\nthem any assistance?"\r\n\r\n"Truly, sir, we do all we can; we are but poor ourselves; however, since\r\nthe commandant has allowed me his paltry twelve francs a month for\r\nlooking after his apartments, I have managed once a week to make a\r\nlittle broth for these poor, unfortunate creatures. Mlle. Rigolette\r\ndeprives herself of her night\'s rest, and sits up, poor girl (though it\r\nburns her candles), contriving out of one bit and the other of her\r\ncutting out, to make up a few clothes for the children; sometimes from\r\nthe morsels left of her work she manages a small nightcap or gown; and\r\nM. Germain, who had not a franc more than he knew what to do with, used\r\nto pretend, from time to time, that he had received a present of a few\r\nbottles of wine from his friends; and Morel (that is the name of the\r\nworkman with the sick family) was sure to be invited to share it with\r\nhim; and it was really wonderful to see how refreshed and strengthened\r\npoor Morel used to seem after M. Germain had made him take a good pull\r\nat his wine, to put, as he used to say, a little life and soul into his\r\nhalf-exhausted body."\r\n\r\n"And the surgeon-dentist, what did he do for this wretched family?"\r\n\r\n"M. Bradamanti?" said the porter. "Ah! he cured my rheumatism, and I owe\r\nhim my eternal gratitude; but from that day I said to my wife,\r\n\'Anastasia, M. Bradamanti\'--hum!--hum!--did I not say so, Anastasia?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly; that is precisely what you did say."\r\n\r\n"But I want to know what this M. Bradamanti did to assist the poor\r\nstarving beings in your garrets."\r\n\r\n"Why, you see, monsieur, when I mentioned to M. Bradamanti the misery\r\nand utter destitution of poor Morel--by the way, he first began the\r\nconversation by complaining that the raving and screaming of the old\r\nidiot woman throughout the night for food prevented him from sleeping,\r\nand that he found it very unpleasant; however, he listened to my\r\ndescription of the state the whole family was in, and then he said,\r\n\'Well, if they are so much distressed, you may tell them that if they\r\nwant any teeth drawn, I will excuse them paying even for the sixth.\'"\r\n\r\n"I tell you what, Madame Pipelet," said Rodolph, "I have a decidedly bad\r\nopinion of this man. And your female pawnbroker, was she more\r\ncharitable?"\r\n\r\n"Very much after the fashion of M. Bradamanti," said the porteress; "she\r\nlent a few sous upon their wretched clothes; every garment they had has\r\npassed into her hands, and even their last mattress; but they were not\r\nlong coming to the last, for they never had but two."\r\n\r\n"But she gave them no further aid?"\r\n\r\n"Help them, poor creatures! Not she. Mother Burette is as great a brute\r\nin her way as her lover, M. Bras Rouge, is in his; for between you and\r\nI," added the porteress, with an uncommonly knowing wink of the eye and\r\nsagacious shake of the head, "there is something rather tender going on\r\nbetween these two."\r\n\r\n"Really!" cried Rodolph.\r\n\r\n"I think so,--I do, upon my life. And why not? Why, the folks in St.\r\nMartin are as loving as the rest of the world; are they not, my old\r\npet?"\r\n\r\nA melancholy shake of the head, which produced a corresponding motion in\r\nthe huge black hat, was M. Pipelet\'s only answer. As for Madame Pipelet,\r\nsince she had begun expressing sympathy for the poor sufferers in the\r\nattics, her countenance had ceased to strike Rodolph as repulsive, and\r\nhe even thought it wore an agreeable expression.\r\n\r\n"And what is this poor Morel\'s trade?"\r\n\r\n"A maker of false jewelry; he works by the piece; but, dear me! that\r\nsort of work is so much imitated, and so cheaply got up that--For a man\r\ncan but work his best, and he cannot do more than he can; besides, when\r\nyou have got to find bread for seven persons without reckoning yourself,\r\nit is rather a hard job, I take it. And though his eldest daughter does\r\nher best to assist the family, she has but very little in her power."\r\n\r\n"How old is this daughter?"\r\n\r\n"About eighteen, and as lovely a young creature as you would see in a\r\nlong summer\'s day. She lives as servant with an old miserly fellow, rich\r\nenough to buy and sell half Paris,--a notary, named M. Jacques Ferrand."\r\n\r\n"M. Jacques Ferrand!" exclaimed Rodolph, surprised at the fresh\r\ncoincidence which brought under his notice the very individual from\r\nwhom, or from whose confidential housekeeper, he expected to glean so\r\nmany particulars relative to La Goualeuse. "M. Jacques Ferrand, who\r\nlives in the Rue du Sentier, do you mean?" inquired he.\r\n\r\n"The very same; are you acquainted with him?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all; but he does the law business for the firm I belong to."\r\n\r\n"Ah! then you must know that he is a regular money-grubbing old usurer;\r\nbut then, let me do the man justice. He is strictly religious, and\r\ndevout as a monk; never absent from mass or vespers, making his Easter\r\nofferings, and going regularly to confession. If he ever enjoys himself,\r\nit is only along with the priests, drinking holy water, and eating\r\nblessed bread. Oh, he is almost a saint in the strictness of his life;\r\nbut, then, his heart is as hard as iron, and as stern and rigid towards\r\nothers as he is severe towards himself. Why, poor Louise, daughter to\r\nour sick lodger, has been his only servant for the last eighteen months.\r\nAnd what a good girl she is! Gentle as a lamb in temper and disposition,\r\nbut willing as a horse to work; and he only gives this poor thing, who\r\nslaves herself to death for him, eighteen francs a month,--not a\r\nfarthing more, I give you my word; and out of this she only keeps back\r\nsix francs for her own maintenance, and hands over the other twelve to\r\nher starving family; that has been all their dependence for some time\r\npast; but when seven persons have to live upon it, it does not go far."\r\n\r\n"But what does the father earn,--I mean, provided he is industrious?"\r\n\r\n"Industrious! God bless you, he has always overworked himself; he is the\r\nsoberest, steadiest creature alive; and I verily believe that if he had\r\nthe promise of obtaining any favour he liked to ask of Heaven, it would\r\nbe that the day might be made doubly as long as it now is, that he might\r\nearn bread enough to stop the cries of his starving brats."\r\n\r\n"Then the father cannot earn enough if he were to try ever so hard, it\r\nseems?"\r\n\r\n"Why, the poor man was ill abed for three months, and that threw them\r\nall behind; his wife\'s health was quite ruined by the fatigue of nursing\r\nhim and the severe want she experienced of common necessaries for\r\nherself and family. She now lies in a dying state; they have had nothing\r\nfor all that period besides Louise\'s wages and what they could obtain\r\nfrom Mother Burette upon the few wretched articles they could dispose\r\nof. True, the master for whom Morel had worked advanced them a trifle,\r\nout of respect for a man he had always found punctual and honest when he\r\ncould work. But, la! Eight people only to be found in bread, that is\r\nwhat I say,--just imagine how hard it must be to keep life and soul\r\ntogether upon such small means; and if you could only see the hole they\r\nare all huddled together in--But do not let us talk any more about that,\r\nmonsieur, for our dinner is ready, and the very thought of their\r\nwretched garret turns my stomach. However, happily, M. Bras Rouge is\r\ngoing to clear the house of them,--when I say happily, I don\'t mean it\r\nill-naturedly in the least; but since these poor Morels have fallen\r\ninto such misery, and it is quite out of our power to help them, why\r\nlet them go and be miserable elsewhere; it will be a heartache the less\r\nfor us all."\r\n\r\n"But, if they are turned out from here, where will they go to?"\r\n\r\n"Truly, I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"And how much can this poor workman earn daily when in health, and\r\nwithout any calls upon his time or attention?"\r\n\r\n"Why, if he had not to attend to his old mother, nurse his sick wife,\r\nand look after the five children, he could earn his three or four francs\r\na day, because he works like a downright slave; but now that at least\r\nthree-quarters of his time are taken up with the family, he can hardly\r\nmanage to earn forty sous."\r\n\r\n"That is little, indeed,--poor creatures!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is easy to say poor creatures, but there are so many equally\r\npoor creatures, that, as we can do nothing for them, it is no use to\r\nworry ourselves about it,--is it, Alfred? And, talking of consoling\r\nourselves, there stands the cassia, and we have never thought of tasting\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"To tell you the truth, Madame Pipelet, after what I have just heard I\r\nhave no inclination to partake of it. You and M. Pipelet must drink my\r\nhealth in it when I am gone."\r\n\r\n"You are extremely kind, sir," said the porter; "but will you not like\r\nto see the rooms up-stairs?"\r\n\r\n"I shall be glad to do so, if perfectly convenient; and, if they suit, I\r\nwill engage them at once and leave a deposit."\r\n\r\nThe porter, followed by Rodolph, emerged from the gloomy lodge, and\r\nproceeded up-stairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE FOUR STORIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe damp, dark staircase looked still more gloomy through the fog of a\r\nNovember day. The entrance to each separate set of apartments in this\r\nhouse bore its own peculiar and distinctive character to the observant\r\neye. Thus, the door conducting to those of the commandant bore evidences\r\nof having been recently painted in close imitation of ebony, being\r\nfurther set off with a brass knob rubbed up to a most dazzling\r\nbrightness, while a gay-coloured bell-rope, finished by an enormous\r\ntassel of scarlet silk, contrasted strongly with the mean and shabby\r\nwall against which it hung.\r\n\r\nThe door of the flight above, where dwelt the female money-lender and\r\ndealer in divination, was singularly characterised by the appearance of\r\nthat mystical symbol of deep wisdom and oracular knowledge, an owl,\r\nwhich, stuffed to resemble life as closely as the artist could contrive\r\nit, was nailed on a small bracket just above the doorway; while a sort\r\nof small wicket, latticed with wire-work, enabled all visitors to be\r\nduly scrutinised ere they were admitted.\r\n\r\nThe dwelling of the Italian charlatan, who was said to pursue such\r\nfearful avocations, had, likewise, its whimsical mode of designating the\r\npursuits of its occupant, whose name, traced in large letters formed of\r\nhorses\' teeth upon a square black board, was nailed to the\r\nentrance-door; while, instead of adopting the classical agency of a\r\ndeer\'s foot or a hare\'s pad for the handle of his bell, there hung\r\ndangling from the cord the hand and arm of a dried ape,--the withered\r\nlimb, the shrivelled hand, with its five fingers, each so distinctly\r\npreserved, and the articulation of every joint so clearly defined, the\r\ntiny tips bearing the nails long and taper as those of a human creature,\r\npresented a close and hideous resemblance to the hand and arm of a\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nAs Rodolph passed before a door so singularly indicative of all his\r\nworst suspicions, he fancied he could detect the sound of smothered sobs\r\nfrom within. Then rose up a cry so full of agony, of convulsive,\r\nirrepressible misery,--a cry as if wrung from a breaking heart or the\r\nlast wail of expiring nature, that the whole house seemed to re-echo it.\r\nRodolph started; then, by a movement more rapid than thought itself, he\r\nrushed to the door and violently pulled the bell.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter, sir?" inquired the astonished porter.\r\n\r\n"That cry!" said Rodolph; "did you not hear it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I heard it; I dare say it is some person whose teeth M.\r\nBradamanti is taking out; perhaps he may be taking out several,--and it\r\nis painful!"\r\n\r\nThis explanation, though a probable one, did not satisfy Rodolph as to\r\nthe horrid scream which still resounded in his ears. Though he had rung\r\nthe bell with considerable violence, no person had as yet replied to his\r\nsummons; he could distinctly hear the shutting of several doors, and\r\nthen, behind a small oval glass let in beside the door, and on which\r\nRodolph had mechanically kept his eyes fixed, he saw the haggard,\r\ncadaverous countenance of a human being; a mass of reddish hair strongly\r\nmixed with gray, and a long beard of the same hue, completed the hideous\r\nensemble; the face was seen but for an instant, and vanished as quickly\r\nas though it had been a mere creation of fancy, leaving Rodolph in a\r\nstate of perturbation impossible to describe.\r\n\r\nShort as had been the period of this apparition\'s visit, he had yet in\r\nthose brief instants recalled features precisely similar and for ever\r\nengraved on his memory,--the eyes shining with the colour and brilliancy\r\nof the _aqua marina_ beneath their bushy sandy eyebrows, the livid\r\ncomplexion, the nose thin, projecting, and curving like an eagle\'s beak,\r\nwith its nostrils so curiously expanded and carved out till they exposed\r\na portion of the nasal cartilage, resembled closely a certain Polidori,\r\nwhose name had been so unceremoniously committed by Murphy, in his\r\nconversation with Grauen, to regions not mentionable to polite ears.\r\nThough Rodolph had not seen Polidori during the last sixteen or\r\nseventeen years, he had a thousand reasons for keeping every feature\r\nwell in his remembrance. The only thing that told against the identity\r\nof the individual he believed existed under the disguised name of this\r\nquack dentist was the circumstance of his having red hair, while the\r\nPolidori of Rodolph\'s acquaintance had almost black. That Rodolph\r\nexperienced no wonder (always supposing his conjectures as to the\r\nidentity correct) at finding a man whose profound learning, rare talent,\r\nand vast intelligence he well knew, sunk to such a degradation,--it\r\nmight even be infamy,--was because he knew equally well that all these\r\nhigh attainments and noble gifts were allied to such entire perversity,\r\nsuch wild and irregular passions, inclinations so corrupt, and, above\r\nall, an affected scorn and contempt for the opinion of the world, which\r\nmight lead this man, when want and misery overtook him, to seek, from\r\nchoice, the lowest and least honourable paths of subsistence, and to\r\nenjoy a sort of malevolent satisfaction in the idea of him, the\r\ntalented, the learned, burying all these precious treasures beneath the\r\nignoble calling to which he had devoted his vast powers of mind and\r\nbody. Still, be it remembered that, spite of the close resemblance\r\nbetween the charlatan surgeon-dentist and the Polidori of bygone years,\r\nthere still existed discrepancies so great that Rodolph balanced, in\r\ndeep uncertainty, respecting their proving to be one and the same\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nAt length, turning to Pipelet, he inquired:\r\n\r\n"How long has this M. Bradamanti been an inmate of this house?"\r\n\r\n"About a year, sir, as nearly as I can remember,--yes, it is a year; I\r\nrecollect he took the lodgings in the January quarter. Oh, he is a very\r\nregular and exact lodger; he cured me of a desperate attack of\r\nrheumatism."\r\n\r\n"Madame Pipelet was telling me of the reports which are circulated of\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"How could she be so foolish?"\r\n\r\n"Nay, pray do not fear me! I assure you I may safely be trusted."\r\n\r\n"But, really, sir," rejoined Pipelet, "I do not think there is the least\r\ndependence to be placed in such reports. I do not believe them, for one.\r\nI never can believe them; my modesty would not let me," added M.\r\nPipelet, turning very red, and preceding his new lodger to the floor\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nThe more resolved upon clearing up his doubts in proportion to the very\r\ngreat annoyance he felt that the residence of Polidori in the same house\r\nwould prove to him, and becoming momentarily more disposed to affix a\r\npainful solution to the enigma of the piercing cry he had heard from the\r\napartments of the Italian, Rodolph bound himself by a rigid promise to\r\ninvestigate the matter, so as to place it beyond the power of a doubt,\r\nand followed the porter to the upper floor, where was situated the\r\nchamber he was desirous of engaging.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to ascertain the abode of his next-door neighbour Mlle.\r\nRigolette. Thanks to the charming gallantry of the painter, Pipelet\'s\r\nmortal foe, the door of her chamber was ornamented after the manner of\r\nWatteau, with a panel design representing about half a dozen fat little\r\nchubby Loves, grouped round a space painted sky blue, and on which was\r\ntraced, in pink letters, "_Mademoiselle Rigolette, Dressmaker_." These\r\nplump little Cupids had all a task to perform besides encircling this\r\nimportant announcement. One held the thimble of Mlle. Rigolette upon his\r\ntiny finger; another held her scissors; a third was provided with a\r\nsmoothing-iron for her use; whilst a fourth held up a mirror, as if to\r\ntempt the young sempstress to forsake her work for the more gratifying\r\nview of her own pretty countenance. The whole was surrounded with a\r\nwell-chosen wreath of flowers, whose gay colours contrasted agreeably\r\nwith the sea-green colour of the door; the whole offering a very\r\nunfavourable contrast to the mean and shabby-looking staircase. At the\r\nrisk of opening anew the bleeding wounds of Alfred, Rodolph ventured to\r\nobserve, while pointing to the door of Mlle. Rigolette:\r\n\r\n"This, I suppose, is the work of M. Cabrion?"\r\n\r\n"It is; he destroyed the painting of the door by daubing it over with a\r\nparcel of fat, indecent children he called his _loves_. Had it not been\r\nfor the entreaties of Mlle. Rigolette, and the weakness of M. Bras\r\nRouge, I would have scratched it all off, as well as this palette filled\r\nwith horrid monsters, with their equally abominable master, whom you can\r\nsee drawn amongst them. You may know him by his steeple-crowned hat."\r\n\r\nAnd there, sure enough, on the door of the room Rodolph was about to\r\nhire, might be seen a palette surrounded by all kinds of odd and\r\nwhimsical creatures, the witty conceit of which might have done honour\r\nto Callot. Rodolph followed the porter into a tolerably good-sized room,\r\naccessible by a small entrance-closet, or antechamber, having two\r\nwindows opening into the Rue du Temple. Some fantastic sketches from the\r\npencil of M. Cabrion, on the second door, had been scrupulously\r\nrespected by M. Germain. Rodolph saw too many reasons for desiring to\r\nobtain this lodging to hesitate further; therefore, modestly placing a\r\ncouple of francs in the hand of the porter, he said:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'_This, I Suppose, Is the Work of M. Cabrion_\'"\r\nEtching by Mercier, after the drawing by Frank T. Merrill]\r\n\r\n"This chamber will exactly suit me. Here is a deposit to complete the\r\nbargain. To-morrow I will send in my furniture; but let me beg of you\r\nnot to destroy the merry creatures painted on the palette at the\r\nentrance. It is really very droll! Don\'t you think so?"\r\n\r\n"Droll!" groaned poor Pipelet; "not I! Ah, sir, how would you like to\r\ndream night after night that you were being hunted by a legion of little\r\nugly devils like these on the door, with Cabrion at their head urging\r\nthem on, and then fancying you are trying to get away, and cannot? Oh, I\r\nhave woke all in a perspiration from such dreams hundreds of times since\r\nthat infamous Cabrion began persecuting me."\r\n\r\n"Why, honestly speaking, I cannot say the chase would be a very\r\nagreeable one, even though but a dream. However, tell me, have I any\r\nneed to see M. Bras Rouge--your great man here--about renting this\r\napartment?"\r\n\r\n"None whatever, sir. He rarely comes near the place, except when he has\r\nany private matters to arrange with Mother Burette. I am the only person\r\nto treat with about hiring apartments. I must beg the favour of your\r\nname."\r\n\r\n"Rodolph."\r\n\r\n"Rodolph what?"\r\n\r\n"Plain Rodolph, M. Pipelet,--nothing more, if you please."\r\n\r\n"Just as you please, sir. I did not ask from curiosity. Every man has a\r\nright to his own free will, as well as to decide upon the name he\r\nchooses to be called."\r\n\r\n"What do you think, M. Pipelet, as to the propriety of my going\r\nto-morrow, as a new neighbour of Morel\'s, to inquire whether I can be of\r\nany service to them? Since my predecessor, M. Germain, was permitted to\r\nassist them according to _his_ means, why should they not accept of what\r\ntrifling help I can afford?"\r\n\r\n"Why, sir, I see no harm in your going to call on the Morels, because it\r\nmay please the poor things; but I hardly see much good it can do, as\r\nthey are so shortly to be turned out of the house." Then, as if suddenly\r\nstruck with a new idea, M. Pipelet exclaimed, winking at Rodolph with\r\nwhat he intended should be a very facetious and penetrating look, "I\r\nsee, I see,--you mean to begin making acquaintance with the lodgers at\r\nthe top of the house, that you may be able to work your way down to\r\nMlle. Rigolette. Ah, I\'ve found you out, you see,--pretty girl--"\r\n\r\n"Well, I think you have discovered my intentions, so I will confess at\r\nonce that I mean to try and be on friendly terms with my agreeable\r\nneighbour."\r\n\r\n"There is no harm in that, sir,--it is customary; only all correct, all\r\nright and honourable,--you understand. Between you and me, I strongly\r\nsuspect Mlle. Rigolette heard us coming up-stairs, and that she is\r\nwatching to have a look as we go down. I will make a noise purposely in\r\nlocking the door; if you look sharp, you will see her as we pass the\r\nlanding." And, true to the porter\'s suspicions, the door so tastefully\r\nenlivened by the fat Cupids, _a la Watteau_, was seen to open gently,\r\nand Rodolph had a brief view of a little, turned-up nose, and a pair of\r\nlarge, staring black eyes, peeping through the narrow space; but, as he\r\nslacked his steps, the door was hastily shut. "I told you she was\r\nwatching us," said the porter. Then added, "Excuse me one instant, sir;\r\nI want to step up to my warehouse."\r\n\r\n"Where is that?"\r\n\r\n"At the top of this ladder is the landing-place, on which the door of\r\nMorel\'s garret opens, and in the wainscoting of this landing is a small\r\ndark cupboard, where I keep my leather, and the wall is so full of\r\ncracks, that when I am in this hole I can see and hear everything, the\r\nsame as if I was in Morel\'s room. Not that I wish to spy what the poor\r\ncreatures are about, God knows,--quite the contrary. But please to\r\nexcuse me for a few minutes, sir, whilst I fetch my bit of leather. If\r\nyou will have the goodness to go down-stairs, I will rejoin you."\r\n\r\nAnd, so saying, Pipelet commenced ascending the steep ladder\r\ncommunicating with his warehouse, as he styled it,--a somewhat perilous\r\nfeat for a person of his age.\r\n\r\nRodolph, thus left alone, cast another glance towards the chambers of\r\nMlle. Rigolette, remembering with deep interest all he had heard of her\r\nbeing the favourite companion of the poor Goualeuse, and recalling also\r\nthe information she was said to possess touching the residence of the\r\nSchoolmaster\'s son, when the sound of some person quitting the\r\napartments of the quack doctor below attracted his attention, and he\r\ncould distinctly hear the light step of a female, with the rustling of a\r\nsilk dress. Rodolph paused till the sounds had died away, and then\r\ndescended the stairs. Something white had fallen about half-way down; it\r\nhad evidently been dropped by the person who had just quitted Polidori.\r\nRodolph picked it up, and carried it to one of the narrow windows which\r\nlighted the staircase. It was a pocket-handkerchief, of the finest\r\ncambric, trimmed with costly lace, and bearing in one corner the\r\ninitials "L. N." beautifully embroidered, and surmounted with a ducal\r\ncoronet. The handkerchief was literally soaked in tears.\r\n\r\nRodolph\'s first impulse was to follow the person from whose hand this\r\nmute evidence of deep woe had fallen, with the view of restoring it,\r\nbut, reflecting that such a step might be mistaken for impertinent\r\ncuriosity, he determined to preserve it carefully, as the first link in\r\nan adventure he found himself almost involuntarily engaged in, and from\r\nwhich he augured a painful and melancholy termination. As he returned to\r\nthe porteress, he inquired whether a female had not just come\r\ndown-stairs.\r\n\r\n"A female! No indeed, sir,--it was a fine, tall, slender-looking lady,\r\nnot a female, and covered over with a thick black veil. She has come\r\nfrom M. Bradamanti. Little Tortillard fetched a coach for her, and she\r\nhas just driven away in it. What struck me was the impudence of that\r\nlittle beggar to seat himself behind the coach. I dare say, though, it\r\nwas to see where the lady went to, for he is as mischievous as a magpie,\r\nand as prying as a ferret, for all his club-foot."\r\n\r\n"So, then," thought Rodolph, "the name and address of this unhappy lady\r\nwill soon be known to this imposter, since it is, doubtless, by his\r\ndirections she is followed and watched by this imp of an emissary."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, and what do you think of the apartment? Will it suit you?"\r\ninquired Madame Pipelet.\r\n\r\n"Nothing could have suited me better. I have taken it, and to-morrow I\r\nshall send in my furniture."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, thank God for a good lodger! I am sure it was a lucky\r\nchance for us sent you here."\r\n\r\n"I hope you will find it so, madame. I think it is well understood\r\nbetween us that you undertake to manage all my little domestic matters\r\nfor me. I shall come and superintend the removal of my goods. Adieu!"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Rodolph left the lodge. The results of his visit to the house\r\nin the Rue du Temple were highly important, both as regarded the\r\nsolution of the deep mystery he so ardently desired to unravel, and also\r\nas affording a wide field for the exercise of his earnest endeavours to\r\ndo good and to prevent evil. After mature calculation, he considered\r\nhimself to have achieved the following results:\r\n\r\nFirst, he had ascertained that Mlle. Rigolette was in possession of the\r\naddress of Germain, the Schoolmaster\'s son. Secondly, a young female,\r\nwho, from appearances, might unhappily be the Marquise d\'Harville, had\r\nmade an appointment with the commandant for the morrow,--perhaps to her\r\nown utter ruin and disgrace; and Rodolph had (as we have before\r\nmentioned) numerous reasons for wishing to preserve the honour and peace\r\nof one for whom he felt so lively an interest as he took in all\r\nconcerning M. d\'Harville. An honest and industrious artisan, crushed by\r\nthe deepest misery, was, with his whole family, about to be turned into\r\nthe streets through the means of Bras Rouge. Further, Rodolph had\r\nundesignedly caught a glimpse of an adventure in which the charlatan\r\nCesar Bradamanti (possibly Polidori) and a female, evidently of rank and\r\nfashion, were the principal actors. And, finally, La Chouette, having\r\nlately quitted the hospital, where she had been since the affair in the\r\nAllee des Veuves, had reappeared on the stage, and was evidently engaged\r\nin some underhand proceedings with the fortune-teller and female\r\nmoney-lender who occupied the second floor of the house.\r\n\r\nHaving carefully noted down all these particulars, Rodolph returned to\r\nhis house, Rue Plumet, deferring till the following day his visit to the\r\nnotary, Jacques Ferrand.\r\n\r\nIt will be no doubt fresh in the memory of our readers, that on this\r\nsame evening Rodolph was engaged to be present at a grand ball given by\r\nthe ambassador of ----. Before following our hero in this new excursion,\r\nlet us cast a retrospective glance on Tom and Sarah,--personages of the\r\ngreatest importance in the development of this history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTOM AND SARAH.\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Seyton, widow of Count Macgregor, and at this time thirty-six or\r\nthirty-seven years of age, was of an excellent Scotch family, daughter\r\nof a baronet, and a country gentleman. Beautiful and accomplished, an\r\norphan at seventeen years old, she had left Scotland with her brother,\r\nThomas Seyton of Halsbury. The absurd predictions of an old Highland\r\nnurse had excited almost to madness the two leading vices in Sarah\'s\r\ncharacter,--pride and ambition; the destiny predicted for her, and in\r\nwhich she fully believed, was of the highest order,--in fact, sovereign\r\nrank. The prophecy had been so often repeated, that the young Scotch\r\ngirl eventually fully credited its fulfilment; and she constantly\r\nrepeated to herself, to bear out her ambitious dream, that a\r\nfortune-teller had thus promised a crown to the handsome and excellent\r\ncreature who afterwards sat on the throne of France, and who was queen\r\nas much by her graces and her kind heart as others have been by their\r\ngrandeur and majesty.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, Thomas Seyton, as superstitious as his sister,\r\nencouraged her foolish hopes, and resolved on devoting his life to the\r\nrealisation of Sarah\'s dream,--a dream as dazzling as it was deceptive.\r\nHowever, the brother and sister were not so blind as to believe\r\nimplicitly in this Highland prophecy, and to look absolutely for a\r\nthrone of the first rank in a splendid disdain of secondary royalties or\r\nreigning principalities; on the contrary, so that the handsome Scotch\r\nlassie should one day encircle her imperial forehead with a sovereign\r\ncrown, the haughty pair agreed to condescend to shut their eyes to the\r\nimportance of the throne they coveted. By the assistance of the\r\n_Almanach de Gotha_ for the year of grace 1819, Seyton arranged, before\r\nhe left Scotland, a sort of synopsis of the ages of all the kings and\r\nruling powers in Europe then unmarried.\r\n\r\nAlthough very ridiculous, yet the brother and sister\'s ambition was\r\nfreed from all shameful modes; Seyton was prepared to aid his sister\r\nSarah in snatching at the thread of the conjugal band by which she hoped\r\neventually to fasten a crown upon her brows. He would be her\r\nparticipator in any and all stratagems which could tend to consummate\r\nthis end; but he would rather have killed his sister than see her the\r\nmistress of a prince, even though the _liaison_ should terminate in a\r\nmarriage of reparation.\r\n\r\nThe matrimonial inventory that resulted from Seyton and Sarah\'s\r\nresearches in the _Almanach de Gotha_ was satisfactory. The Germanic\r\nConfederation furnished forth a numerous contingent of young presumptive\r\nsovereigns. Seyton was not ignorant of the sort of German wedlock which\r\nis called a "left-handed marriage," to which, as being legitimate to a\r\ncertain extent, he would, as a last resource, have resigned his sister.\r\nTo Germany, then, it was resolved to bend their steps, in order to\r\ncommence this search for the royal spouse.\r\n\r\nIf the project appears improbable, such hopes ridiculous, let us first\r\nreply by saying that unbridled ambition, excited by superstitious\r\nbelief, rarely claims for itself the light of reason in its enterprises,\r\nand will dare the wildest impossibilities; yet, when we recall certain\r\nevents, even in our own times, from high and most reputable morganatic\r\nmarriages between sovereigns and female subjects, down to the loving\r\nelopement of Miss Penelope Smith and the Prince of Capua, we cannot\r\nrefuse some chance of fortunate result to the imagination of Seyton and\r\nSarah. Let us add that the lady united to a very lovely person, singular\r\nabilities and very varied talents; whilst there were added a power of\r\nseduction the more dangerous as it was united to a mind unbending and\r\ncalculating, a disposition cunning and selfish, a deep hypocrisy, a\r\nstubborn and despotic will,--all covered by the outward show of a\r\ngenerous, warm, and impassioned nature.\r\n\r\nIn her appearance, there was as much deceit as in her mind. Her full and\r\ndark eyes, now sparkling, now languishing, beneath her coal black brow,\r\ncould well dissimulate all the warmth of love and desire. Yet the\r\nburning impulses of love never throbbed beneath her icy bosom; no\r\nsurprise of the heart or of the senses ever intervened to disturb the\r\ncold and pitiless calculations of this woman,--crafty, selfish, and\r\nambitious. When she reached the Continent, she resolved, in accordance\r\nwith her brother\'s advice, not to commence her conjugal and regal\r\ncampaign until she had resided some time in Paris, where she determined\r\nto complete her education, and rub off the rust of her native country,\r\nby associating with a society which was embellished by all that was\r\nelegant, tasteful, and refined. Sarah was introduced into the best\r\nsociety and the highest circles, thanks to the letters of recommendation\r\nand considerate patronage of the English "ambassador\'s" lady and the old\r\nMarquis d\'Harville, who had known Tom and Sarah\'s father in England.\r\n\r\nPersons of deceitful, calculating, and cold dispositions acquire with\r\ngreat facility language and manners quite in opposition to their natural\r\ncharacter, as with them all is outside, surface, appearance, varnish,\r\nbark; or they soon find that, if their real characters are detected,\r\nthey are undone; so, thanks to the sort of instinct of self-preservation\r\nwith which they are gifted, they feel all the necessity of the moral\r\nmask, and so paint and costume themselves with all the alacrity and\r\nskill of a practised comedian. Thus, after six months\' residence in\r\nParis, Sarah was in a condition to contest with the most Parisian of\r\nParisian women, as to the piquant finish of her wit, the charm of her\r\nliveliness, the ingenuousness of her flirtation, and the exciting\r\nsimplicity of her looks, at once chaste and passionate.\r\n\r\nFinding his sister in full panoply for his campaign, Seyton left with\r\nher for Germany, furnished with the best letters of introduction. The\r\nfirst state of the German Confederation which headed Sarah\'s "road-book"\r\nwas the Grand Duchy of Gerolstein, thus styled in the diplomatic and\r\ninfallible _Almanach de Gotha_ for the year of grace 1819:\r\n\r\n   "_Genealogy of the Sovereigns of Europe and their Families_.\r\n\r\n                           "GEROLSTEIN.\r\n\r\n   "Grand Duke: MAXIMILIAN RODOLPH, 10th December, 1764. Succeeded\r\n   his father, CHARLES FREDERIC RODOLPH, 21st April, 1785. Widower\r\n   January, 1808, by decease of his wife, LOUISA AMELIA, daughter\r\n   of JOHN AUGUSTUS, Prince of BURGLEN.\r\n\r\n   "_Son_: GUSTAVUS RODOLPH, born 17th April, 1803.\r\n\r\n   "_Mother_: Dowager Grand Duchess Judith, widow of the Grand\r\n   Duke, CHARLES FREDERIC RODOLPH, 21st April, 1785."\r\n\r\nSeyton, with much practical good sense, had first noted down on his list\r\nthe youngest princes whom he coveted as brothers-in-law, thinking that\r\nextreme youth is more easily seduced than ripened age. Moreover, we have\r\nalready said that the brother and sister were particularly recommended\r\nto the reigning Duke of Gerolstein by the old Marquis d\'Harville,\r\ncaught, like the rest of the world, by Sarah, whose beauty, grace, and,\r\nabove all, delightful manners, he could not sufficiently admire.\r\n\r\nIt is superfluous to say that the presumptive heir of the Grand Duchy of\r\nGerolstein was Gustavus Rodolph: he was hardly eighteen when Tom and\r\nSarah were presented to his father. The arrival of the young Scotch\r\nlady was an event in the German court, so quiet, simple, and almost\r\npatriarchal in its habits and observances. The Grand Duke, a most worthy\r\ngentleman, governed his states with wise firmness and paternal kindness.\r\nNothing could exceed the actual and moral happiness of the principality,\r\nwhose laborious and steady population, by their soberness and piety,\r\npresented a pure specimen of the German character. This excellent people\r\nenjoyed so much real felicity, and were so perfectly contented with\r\ntheir condition, that the enlightened care of the Grand Duke was not\r\nmuch called into action to preserve them from the mania of\r\nconstitutional innovations. As far as modern discovery went, and those\r\npractical suggestions which have a wholesome influence over the\r\nwell-being and morals of his people, the Grand Duke was always anxious\r\nto acquire knowledge himself, and apply it invariably for the use and\r\nbenefit of his people, his residents at the capitals of the different\r\nstates of Europe having little else to occupy themselves whilst on their\r\nmission but to keep their master fully informed as to the rise and\r\nprogress of science and all the arts which are connected with public\r\nwelfare and public utility.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the Duke felt as much affection as gratitude for the\r\nold Marquis d\'Harville, who, in 1815, had rendered him immense service;\r\nand so, thanks to his powerful recommendation, Sarah of Halsbury and her\r\nbrother were received at the court of Gerolstein with every distinction,\r\nand with marked kindness. A fortnight after her arrival, the young\r\nScotch girl, endued with so profound a spirit of observation, had easily\r\npenetrated the firm character and open heart of the Grand Duke. Before\r\nshe began to seduce his son,--a thing of course,--she had wisely\r\nresolved to discover the disposition of the father. Although he had\r\nappeared to dote on his son, she was yet fully convinced that this\r\nfather, with all his tenderness, would never swerve from certain\r\nprinciples, certain ideas as to the duty of princes, and would never\r\nconsent to what he would consider a _mesalliance_ for his son, and that\r\nnot through pride, but from conscience, reason, and dignity. A man of\r\nthis firm mould, and the more affectionate and good in proportion as he\r\nis firm and determined, never abates one jot of that which affects his\r\nconscience, his reason, and his dignity.\r\n\r\nSarah was on the point of renouncing her enterprise in the face of\r\nobstacles so insurmountable; but, reflecting that, as Rodolph was very\r\nyoung, and his gentleness and goodness, his character at once timid and\r\nmeditative, were generally spoken of, she thought she might find\r\ncompensation in the feeble and irresolute disposition of the young\r\nprince, and therefore persisted in her project, and again revived her\r\nhopes.\r\n\r\nOn this new essay, the management of herself and brother were most\r\nmasterly. The young lady knew full well how to propitiate all around\r\nher, and particularly the persons who might have been jealous or envious\r\nof her accomplishments, and she caused her beauty and grace to be\r\nforgotten beneath the veil of modest simplicity with which she covered\r\nthem. She soon became the idol, not only of the Grand Duke, but of his\r\nmother, the Dowager Grand Duchess Judith, who, in spite of, or through,\r\nher ninety years of age, loved to excess every thing that was young and\r\ncharming.\r\n\r\nSarah and her brother often talked of their departure, but the sovereign\r\nof Gerolstein would never consent to it; and that he might completely\r\nattach the two to him, he pressed on Sir Thomas Seyton the acceptance of\r\nthe vacant post of his "first groom of the chamber," and entreated Sarah\r\nnot to quit the Grand Duchess Judith, as she could not do without her.\r\nAfter much hesitation, overcome by the most pressing entreaties, Sarah\r\nand Seyton accepted such brilliant offers, and decided on establishing\r\nthemselves at the court of Gerolstein, where they had been for two\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nSarah, who was an accomplished musician, knowing the taste of the Grand\r\nDuchess for the old masters, and, above all, for Gluck, sent for the\r\n_chef-d\'oeuvre_ of this attractive composer, and fascinated the old\r\nprincess by her unfailing complaisance, as well as the remarkable skill\r\nwith which she sang those old airs, so beautiful in their melody, so\r\nexpressive in their character.\r\n\r\nAs for Seyton, he knew how to make himself very useful in the occupation\r\nwhich had been conferred upon him. He was a good judge of horses, was\r\norderly and firm in his conduct and arrangements, and so, in a short\r\ntime, completely remodelled the stables of the Grand Duke, which, up to\r\nthat time, had been neglected, and become disorganised.\r\n\r\nThe brother and sister were soon equally beloved, feted, and admired in\r\nthis court. The master\'s preference soon commands the preference of\r\nthose below him. Sarah required, in aid of her future projects, too much\r\naid not to employ her insinuating powers in acquiring partisans. Her\r\nhypocrisy, clothed in most attractive shapes, easily deluded the\r\nsimple-hearted Germans, and the general feeling soon authorised the\r\nextreme kindness of the Grand Duke.\r\n\r\nThus, then, our designing pair were established at the court of\r\nGerolstein, agreeably and securely placed without any reference to\r\nRodolph. By a lucky chance, some days after the arrival of Sarah, the\r\nyoung prince had gone away to the inspection of troops, with an\r\naide-de-camp and the faithful Murphy. This absence, doubly auspicious to\r\nthe views of Sarah, allowed her to arrange at her ease the principal\r\nthreads of the fillet she was weaving, without being deterred by the\r\npresence of the young prince, whose too open admiration might, perhaps,\r\nhave awakened the suspicions of the Grand Duke. On the contrary, in the\r\nabsence of his son, he did not, unfortunately, reflect that he was\r\nadmitting into the closest intimacy a young girl of surpassing beauty,\r\nand of lively wit, as Rodolph must discover at every moment of the day.\r\n\r\nSarah was perfectly insensible to a reception so kind and generous,--to\r\nthe full confidence with which she was introduced into the very heart of\r\nthis sovereign family. Neither brother nor sister paused for a moment in\r\ntheir bad designs; they determined upon a principle to bring trouble and\r\nannoyance into this peaceable and happy court; they calmly calculated\r\nthe probable results of the cruel divisions they should establish\r\nbetween a father and son, up to that period so tenderly united.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few words concerning Rodolph\'s early days may be necessary. During his\r\ninfancy, he had been extremely delicate. His father reasoned thereon in\r\nthis strange manner: "English country gentlemen are generally remarkable\r\nfor their robust health. This advantage results generally from their\r\nbodily training, which is simple, rural, and develops their full vigour.\r\nRodolph must leave the hands of women; his temperament is delicate, and,\r\nperhaps, by accustoming this child to live like the son of an English\r\nfarmer (with some few exceptions), I shall strengthen his constitution."\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duke sent to England for a man worthy of the trust, and\r\ncapable of directing such a course of bodily culture, and Sir Walter\r\nMurphy, an athletic specimen, of a Yorkshire country gentleman, was\r\nentrusted with this important charge. The direction which he gave to the\r\nmind and body of the young prince were such as entirely coincided with\r\nthe views and wishes of the Grand Duke. Murphy and his pupil lived for\r\nmany years in a beautiful farmhouse, situated in the midst of woods and\r\nfields, some leagues from the capital of Gerolstein, and in a most\r\npicturesque and salubrious spot. Rodolph, free from all etiquette, and\r\nemployed with Murphy in outdoor labour proportionate to his age, lived\r\nthe sober, manly, and regular life of the country, having for his\r\npleasure and amusement the violent exercises of wrestling, pugilism,\r\nriding on horseback, and hunting. In the midst of the pure air of the\r\nmeadows, woods, and mountains, he underwent an entire change, and grew\r\nup as vigorous as a young oak; his pale cheek became suffused with the\r\nruddy glow of health; always lithe and active, he underwent now the most\r\nsevere fatigues, his address, energy, and courage supplying what was\r\ndeficient in his muscular power; so that, when only in his fifteenth or\r\nsixteenth year, he was always the conqueror in his contests with young\r\nmen his superiors in age.\r\n\r\nHis scientific education necessarily suffered from the preference given\r\nto his physical training, and Rodolph\'s knowledge was very limited; but\r\nthe Grand Duke very wisely reflected that, to have a well-informed mind,\r\nit must be supported by a strong physical frame, and that, this\r\nacquired, the intellectual faculties would develop themselves the more\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nThe kind Walter Murphy was by no means a sage, and could only convey to\r\nRodolph some primary instruction; but no one knew better than he how to\r\ninspire his pupil with the feeling of what is just, loyal, and generous,\r\nand a horror of every thing that was mean, low, and contemptible. These\r\nrepugnances, these powerful and wholesome admonitions, took deep and\r\nlasting root in the very soul of Rodolph; and although, in after life,\r\nthese principles were violently shaken by the storm of passions, yet\r\nthey were never eradicated from his heart. The levin bolt strikes,\r\nsplits, and rends the deeply planted tree; but the sap still maintains\r\nits hold in the roots, and a thousand green branches spring fresh from\r\nwhat was taken for a withered and dead tree.\r\n\r\nMurphy, then, gave to Rodolph, if we may use the expression, health to\r\nboth body and mind; he made him robust, active, and daring, with a love\r\nfor all that was good and right, and a hatred for whatsoever was wicked\r\nand bad. Having fulfilled his task to admiration, the squire, called to\r\nEngland on very important business, left Germany for some time, to the\r\ngreat regret of Rodolph, who loved him extremely.\r\n\r\nHis son\'s health having been so satisfactorily established, the Grand\r\nDuke turned his most serious attention to the mental education of his\r\ndearly beloved son. A certain Doctor Cesar Polidori, a renowned\r\nlinguist, a distinguished chemist, learned historian, and deeply versed\r\nin the study of all the exact and physical sciences, was entrusted with\r\nthe charge of cultivating and improving the rich but virgin soil so\r\ncarefully and well prepared by Murphy. This time the Grand Duke\'s choice\r\nwas a most unfortunate one, or, rather, his religious feelings were\r\ninfamously imposed upon by the person who introduced the doctor to him,\r\nand caused him to think on Polidori as the preceptor of the young\r\nprince. Atheist, cheat, and hypocrite, full of stratagem and trick,\r\nconcealing the most dangerous immorality, the most hardened scepticism,\r\nunder an austere exterior, profoundly versed in the knowledge of human\r\nnature, or, rather, only having tried the worst side,--the disgraceful\r\npassions of humanity,--Doctor Polidori was the most hateful Mentor that\r\ncould have been entrusted with the education of a young man.\r\n\r\nRodolph left with the deepest regrets the independent and animating life\r\nwhich he had hitherto led with Murphy to go and become pale with the\r\nstudy of books, and submit himself to the irksome ceremonies of his\r\nfather\'s court, and he at once entertained a strong prejudice against\r\nhis tutor. It could not be otherwise.\r\n\r\nOn quitting his young friend, the poor squire had compared him, and with\r\njustice, to a young wild colt, full of grace and fire, carried off from\r\nhis native prairies, where he had dwelt, free as air, and joyous as a\r\nbird, to be bridled and spurred, that he might under that system learn\r\nhow to moderate and economise those powers which, hitherto, he had only\r\nemployed in running and leaping in any way he pleased.\r\n\r\nRodolph began by telling Polidori that he had no taste for study, but\r\nthat he greatly preferred the free exercise of his arms and legs, to\r\nbreathe the pure air of the fields, to traverse the woods and the\r\nmountains, and that a good horse and a good gun were preferable to all\r\nthe books in the universe. The doctor was prepared for this antipathy,\r\nand was secretly delighted at it, for, in another way, the hopes of this\r\nman were as ambitious as those of Sarah. Although the grand duchy of\r\nGerolstein was only a secondary state, Polidori indulged the idea of\r\nbeing one day its Richelieu, and of making Rodolph play the part of the\r\ndo-nothing prince. But, desirous above all things of currying favour\r\nwith his pupil, and of making him forget Murphy, by his own concession\r\nand compliance, he concealed from the Grand Duke the young prince\'s\r\nrepugnance for study, and boasted of his application to, and rapid\r\nprogress in, his studies; whilst some examinations arranged between\r\nhimself and Rodolph, which had the air of being impromptu questions,\r\nconfirmed the Grand Duke in his blind and implicit confidence. By\r\ndegrees the dislike which Rodolph at first entertained for the doctor\r\nchanged, on the young prince\'s part, into a cool familiarity, very\r\nunlike the real attachment he had for Murphy. By degrees, he found\r\nhimself leagued with Polidori (although from very innocent causes) by\r\nthe same ties that unite two guilty persons. Sooner or later, Rodolph\r\nwas sure to despise a man of the age and character of the doctor, who so\r\nunworthily lied to excuse the idleness of his pupil. This Polidori knew;\r\nbut he also knew that if we do not at once sever our connections with\r\ncorrupt minds in disgust, by degrees, and in spite of our better reason,\r\nwe become familiar with and too frequently admire them, until,\r\ninsensibly, we hear without shame or reproach those things mocked at and\r\nvituperated which we formerly loved and revered. Besides, the doctor\r\nwas too cunning all at once to shock certain noble sentiments and\r\nconvictions which Rodolph had derived from the admirable lessons of\r\nMurphy. After having vented much raillery on the coarseness of the early\r\noccupations of his young pupil, the doctor, laying aside his thin mask\r\nof austerity, had greatly aroused the curiosity and heated the fancy of\r\nthe young prince, by the exaggerated descriptions, strongly drawn and\r\ndeeply coloured, of the pleasures and gallantries which had illustrated\r\nthe reigns of Louis XIV., the Regent, and especially Louis XV., the hero\r\nof Cesar Polidori. He assured the misled boy, who listened to him with a\r\nfatal earnestness, that pleasures, however excessive, far from\r\ndemoralising a highly accomplished prince, often made him merciful and\r\ngenerous, inasmuch as fine minds are never more predisposed to\r\nbenevolence and clemency than when acted upon by their own enjoyments.\r\nLouis XV., the _bien aime_, the well-beloved, was an unanswerable proof\r\nof this. And then, added the doctor, how entirely have the greatest men\r\nof all ages and all countries abandoned themselves to the most refined\r\nepicureanism,--from Alcibiades to Maurice of Saxony, from Anthony to the\r\ngreat Conde, from Caesar to Vendome! Such conversations must make deep\r\nand dangerous impressions on a young, ardent, and virgin mind, and such\r\ntheories could not be without their results.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this well regulated and virtuous court, accustomed,\r\nafter the example of its ruler, to honest pleasures and harmless\r\namusements, Rodolph, instructed by Polidori, dreamt of the dissipated\r\nnights of Versailles, the orgies of Choisy, the attractive\r\nvoluptuousness of the Parc-au-Cerfs, and also, from time to time, of\r\nsome romantic amours contrasting with these. Neither had the doctor\r\nfailed to prove to Rodolph that a prince of the Germanic Confederation\r\nshould not have any military pretension beyond sending his contingent to\r\nthe Diet. The feeling of the time was not warlike. According to the\r\ndoctor, to pass his time delightfully and idly amongst women and the\r\nrefinements of luxury,--to repose from time to time from the animation\r\nof sensual pleasures, amidst the delightful attractions of the fine\r\narts,--to hunt occasionally, not as a Nimrod, but as an intelligent\r\nepicurean, and enjoy the transitory fatigues which make idleness and\r\nrepose taste but the sweeter,--this, this was the only life which a\r\nprince should think of enjoying, who (and this was his height of\r\nhappiness) could find a prime minister capable of devoting himself\r\nboldly to the distressing and overwhelming burden of state affairs.\r\n\r\nRodolph, in abandoning himself to ideas which were free from\r\ncriminality, because they did not spring from the circle of fatal\r\nprobabilities, resolved that when Providence should call to himself the\r\nGrand Duke, his father, he would devote himself to the life which Cesar\r\nPolidori had painted to him under such brilliant and attractive colours,\r\nand to have as his prime minister one whose knowledge and understanding\r\nhe admired, and whose blind complaisance he fully appreciated. It is\r\nuseless to say that the young prince kept the most perfect silence upon\r\nthe subject of those pernicious hopes which had been excited within him.\r\nKnowing that the heroes of the Grand Duke\'s admiration were Gustavus\r\nAdolphus, Charles XII., and the great Frederic (Maximilian Rodolph had\r\nthe honour of belonging to the royal house of Brandenburg), Rodolph\r\nthought, reasonably enough, that the prince, his father, who professed\r\nso profound an admiration for these king-captains, always booted and\r\nspurred, continually mounted on their chargers, and engaged in making\r\nwar, would consider his son out of his senses if he believed him capable\r\nof wishing to displace the Tudescan gravity of his court by the\r\nintroduction of the light and licentious manners of the Regency.\r\n\r\nA year--eighteen months--passed away. At the end of this time Murphy\r\nreturned from England, and wept for joy on again embracing his young\r\npupil. After a few days, although unable to discover the reason of a\r\nchange which so deeply afflicted him, the worthy squire found Rodolph\r\nchilled and constrained in his demeanour towards him, and almost rude\r\nwhen he recalled to him his sequestered and rural life. Assured of the\r\nnatural kind heart of the young prince, and warned by a secret\r\npresentiment, Murphy thought him for a time perverted by the pernicious\r\ninfluence of Doctor Polidori, whom he instinctively abhorred, and\r\nresolved to watch very narrowly. The doctor, for his part, was very much\r\nannoyed by Murphy\'s return, for he feared his frankness, good sense, and\r\nkeen penetration. He instantly resolved, therefore, cost what it might,\r\nto ruin the worthy Englishman in Rodolph\'s estimation. It was at this\r\ncrisis that Seyton and Sarah were presented and received at the court of\r\nGerolstein with such extreme distinction. We have said that Rodolph,\r\naccompanied by Murphy, had been absent from the court on a journey for\r\nsome weeks. During this absence the doctor was by no means idle. It is\r\nsaid that intriguers discover and recognise each other by certain\r\nmysterious signs, which allow of them observing each other until their\r\ninterests decide them to form a close alliance, or declare unremitting\r\nhostility.\r\n\r\nSome days after the establishment of Sarah and her brother at the court\r\nof the Grand Duke, Polidori became a close ally of Seyton\'s. The doctor\r\nconfessed to himself, with delectable cynicism, that he felt a natural\r\naffinity for rogues and villains, and so he said that without pretending\r\nto discover the end which Sarah and her brother desired to achieve, he\r\nwas attracted towards them by a sympathy so strong as to lead him to\r\nimagine that they plotted some devilish purpose. Some questions of\r\nSeyton\'s as to the disposition and early life of Rodolph, questions\r\nwhich would have passed without notice with a person less awake to all\r\nthat occurred than the doctor, in a moment enlightened him as to the\r\nulterior aims of the brother and sister; all he doubted was, that the\r\naspirations of the Scotch lady were at the same time honourable as well\r\nas ambitious. The arrival of this lovely young woman appeared to\r\nPolidori a godsend. Rodolph\'s mind was already inflamed with amorous\r\nimaginings; Sarah might become, or be made, the delicious reality which\r\nshould substantiate so many glorious dreams. It was not to be doubted\r\nbut that she would secure an immense influence over a heart submitted to\r\nthe witching spell of a first love. The doctor instantly laid his plan\r\nto direct and secure this influence, and to make it serve also as the\r\nmeans of destroying Murphy\'s power and reputation. Like a skilful\r\nintriguer, he soon informed the aspiring pair that they must come to an\r\nunderstanding with him, as he alone was responsible to the Grand Duke\r\nfor the private life of the young prince.\r\n\r\nSarah and her brother understood him in a moment, although they had not\r\ntold the doctor a syllable of their secret designs. On the return of\r\nRodolph and Murphy, all three, combined by one common intent, tacitly\r\nleagued against the squire, their most redoubtable enemy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat was to happen did happen. Rodolph saw Sarah daily after his return,\r\nand became desperately enamoured. She soon told him that she shared his\r\nlove, although she foresaw that this love would create great trouble. He\r\ncould never be happy; the distance that separated them was too wide! She\r\nthen recommended to Rodolph the most profound discretion, for fear of\r\narousing the Grand Duke\'s suspicions, as he would be inexorable, and\r\ndeprive them of their only happiness,--that of seeing each other every\r\nday. The young prince promised to be cautious, and conceal his love. The\r\nScotch maiden was too ambitious, too self-possessed, to compromise and\r\nbetray herself in the eyes of the court; and Rodolph, perceiving the\r\nnecessity of dissimulation, imitated Sarah\'s prudence. The lovers\'\r\nsecret was carefully preserved for some time; nor was it until the\r\nbrother and sister saw the unbridled passion of their dupe reach its\r\nutmost excess, and that his infatuation, which he could hardly restrain,\r\nthreatened to burst forth afresh, and destroy all, that they resolved on\r\ntheir final _coup_. The doctor\'s character authorising the confidence,\r\nbesides the morality which invested it, Seyton opened to him on the\r\nnecessity of a marriage between Rodolph and Sarah; otherwise, he added,\r\nwith perfect sincerity, he and his sister would instantly leave\r\nGerolstein. Sarah participated in the prince\'s affection, but,\r\npreferring death to dishonour, she could only be the wife of his\r\nhighness.\r\n\r\nThis exalted flight of ambition stupefied the doctor, who had never\r\nimagined that Sarah\'s imagination soared so high. A marriage surrounded\r\nby numberless difficulties and dangers appeared impossible to Polidori,\r\nand he frankly told Seyton the reasons why the Grand Duke would never\r\nsubmit to such a union. Seyton agreed in the importance of the reasons,\r\nbut proposed, as a _mezzo termini_ which should meet all objections, a\r\nmarriage, which, although secret, should be legal, and only avowed after\r\nthe decease of the Grand Duke. Sarah was of a noble and ancient house,\r\nand such a union was not without precedent. Seyton gave the prince eight\r\ndays to decide; his sister could not longer endure the cruel anguish of\r\nuncertainty, and, if she must renounce Rodolph\'s love, she must act up\r\nto her painful resolve as promptly as might be.\r\n\r\nCertain that he could not mistake Sarah\'s views, the doctor was sorely\r\nperplexed. He had three ways before him,--to inform the Grand Duke of\r\nthe matrimonial project, to open Rodolph\'s eyes as to the manoeuvres\r\nof Tom and Sarah, to lend himself to the marriage. But to inform the\r\nGrand Duke would be to alienate from him for ever the heir presumptive\r\nto the throne. To enlighten Rodolph on the interested views of Sarah was\r\nto expose himself to the reception which a lover is sure to give when\r\nshe whom he loves is depreciated in his eyes; and then, what a blow for\r\nthe vanity or the heart of the young prince, to let him know that it was\r\nfor his royal rank alone that the lady was desirous to wed him! On the\r\nother hand, by lending himself to this match, Polidori bound Rodolph and\r\nSarah to him by a tie of the strongest gratitude, or, at least, by the\r\ncomplicity of a dangerous act. No doubt, all might be discovered, and\r\nthe doctor exposed to the anger of the Grand Duke, but then the marriage\r\nwould have been concluded, the union legal. The storm would blow over,\r\nand the future sovereign of Gerolstein would become the more bound to\r\nPolidori, in proportion as the doctor had undergone greater dangers in\r\nhis service. After much consideration, therefore, he resolved on serving\r\nSarah, but with a certain qualification, which we will presently refer\r\nto.\r\n\r\nRodolph\'s passion had reached a height almost of frenzy. Violently\r\nexcited by constraint, and the skilful management of Sarah, who\r\npretended to feel still more than he did the insurmountable obstacles\r\nwhich honour and duty placed between them and their liberty, in a few\r\ndays more the young prince would have betrayed himself. Thus, when the\r\ndoctor proposed that he must never see his enchantress again, or possess\r\nher by a secret marriage, Rodolph threw himself on Polidori\'s neck,\r\ncalled him his saviour, his friend, his father; he only wished that the\r\ntemple and the priest were at hand, that he might marry her that\r\ninstant. The doctor resolved (for reasons of his own) to undertake the\r\nmanagement of all. He found a priest,--witnesses; and the union (all the\r\nformalities of which were carefully scrutinised and verified by Seyton)\r\nwas secretly celebrated during a temporary absence of the Grand Duke at\r\na conference of the German Diet. The prophecy of the Scotch soothsayer\r\nwas fulfilled,--Sarah wedded the heir to a throne.\r\n\r\nWithout quenching the fire of his love, possession rendered Rodolph more\r\ncircumspect, and cooled down that violence which might have compromised\r\nthe secret of his passion for Sarah; but, directed by Seyton and the\r\ndoctor, the young couple managed so well, and observed so much\r\ncircumspection towards each other, that they eluded all detection.\r\n\r\nAn event, impatiently desired by Sarah, soon turned this calm into a\r\ntempest,--she was about to become a mother. It was then that this woman\r\nevinced all those exactions which were so new to, and so much\r\nastonished, Rodolph. She protested, with hypocritical tears streaming\r\nfrom her eyes, that she could no longer support the constraint in which\r\nshe lived; a constraint rendered the more insupportable by her\r\npregnancy. In this extremity she boldly proposed to the young prince to\r\ntell all to his father, who was, as well as the Dowager Grand Duchess,\r\nfonder than ever of her. No doubt, she added, he will be very angry,\r\ngreatly enraged, at first, but he loves his son so tenderly, so blindly,\r\nand had for her (Sarah) so strong an affection, that his paternal anger\r\nwould gradually subside, and she would at last take in the court of\r\nGerolstein the rank which was due to her, she might say in a double\r\nsense, because she was about to give birth to a child, which would be\r\nthe heir presumptive to the Grand Duke. These pretensions alarmed\r\nRodolph: he knew the deep attachment which his father had for him, but\r\nhe also well knew the inflexibility of his principles with regard to all\r\nthe duties of a prince. To all these objections Sarah replied, unmoved:\r\n\r\n"I am your wife in the presence of God and men. In a short time, I shall\r\nno longer be able to conceal my situation; and I ought not to blush at\r\nthat of which I am, on the contrary, so proud, and would desire openly\r\nto acknowledge."\r\n\r\nThe expectation of posterity had redoubled Rodolph\'s tenderness for\r\nSarah, and, placed between the desire to accede to her wishes and the\r\ndread of his father\'s wrath, he experienced the bitterest anguish.\r\nSeyton sided with his sister.\r\n\r\n"The marriage is indissoluble," said he to his royal brother-in-law;\r\n"the Grand Duke may exile you from his court,--you and your\r\nwife,--nothing more; but he loves you too much to have recourse to such\r\nan extremity. He will endure what he cannot prevent."\r\n\r\nThese reasons, strong enough in themselves, did not soothe Rodolph\'s\r\nanxieties. At this juncture, Seyton was charged by the Grand Duke with\r\nan errand to visit several breeding studs in Austria. This mission,\r\nwhich he could not refuse, would only detain him a fortnight: he set out\r\nwith much regret, and in a very important moment for his sister. She was\r\nchagrined, yet satisfied, at the departure of her brother; for she would\r\nlose his advice, but then he would be safe from the Grand Duke\'s anger\r\nif all were discovered. Sarah promised to keep Seyton fully informed,\r\nday by day, of the progress of events, so important to both of them;\r\nand, that they might correspond more surely and secretly, they agreed\r\nupon a cipher, of which Polidori also held the key. This precaution\r\nalone proves that Sarah had other matters to tell her brother of besides\r\nher love for Rodolph. In truth, this selfish, cold, ambitious woman had\r\nnot felt the ice of her heart melt even by the beams of the passionate\r\nlove which had been breathed to her. Her maternity was only with her a\r\nmeans of acting more effectually on Rodolph, and had no softening effect\r\non her iron soul. The youth, headlong love, and inexperience of the\r\nprince, who was hardly more than a child, and so perfidiously ensnared\r\ninto an inextricable position, hardly excited an interest in the mind of\r\nthis selfish creature; and, in her confidential communications with him,\r\nshe complained, with disdain and bitterness, of the weakness of this\r\nyoung man, who trembled before the most paternal of German princes, who\r\nlived, however, very long! In a word, this correspondence between the\r\nbrother and sister clearly developed their unbounded selfishness, their\r\nambitious calculations, their impatience, which almost amounted to\r\nhomicide, and laid bare the springs of that dark conspiracy crowned by\r\nthe marriage of Rodolph. One of Sarah\'s letters to her brother was\r\nabstracted by Polidori, the channel of their mutual communications; for\r\nwhat purpose we shall see hereafter.\r\n\r\nA few days after Seyton\'s departure, Sarah was at the evening court of\r\nthe Dowager Grand Duchess. Many of the ladies present looked at her with\r\nan astonished air, and whispered to their neighbours. The Grand Duchess\r\nJudith, in spite of her ninety years, had a quick ear and a sharp eye,\r\nand this little whispering did not escape her. She made a sign to one of\r\nthe ladies in waiting to come to her, and from her she learned that\r\neverybody was remarking that the figure of Miss Sarah Seyton of Halsbury\r\nwas less slender, less delicate in its proportions than usual. The old\r\nprincess adored her young protegee and would have answered to God\r\nhimself for Sarah\'s virtue. Indignant at the malevolence of these\r\nremarks, she shrugged her shoulders, and said aloud, from the end of the\r\nsaloon in which she was sitting:\r\n\r\n"My dear Sarah, come here."\r\n\r\nSarah rose. It was requisite to cross the circle to reach the place\r\nwhere the princess was seated, who was anxious most kindly to destroy\r\nthe rumour that was circulated, and, by the simple fact of thus crossing\r\nthe room, confound her calumniators, and prove triumphantly that the\r\nfair proportions of her protegee had lost not one jot of their symmetry\r\nand delicacy. Alas! the most perfidious enemy could not have devised a\r\nbetter plan than that suggested by the worthy princess in her desire to\r\ndefend her protegee. Sarah came towards her, and it required all the\r\ndeep respect due to the Grand Duchess to repress the murmur of surprise\r\nand indignation when the young lady crossed the room. The\r\nnearest-sighted persons saw what Sarah would no longer conceal, for her\r\npregnancy might have been hidden longer had she but have chosen; but the\r\nambitious woman had sought this display in order to compel Rodolph to\r\ndeclare his marriage. The Grand Duchess, who, however, would not be\r\nconvinced in spite of her eyesight, said, in a low voice, to Sarah:\r\n\r\n"My dear child, how very ill you have dressed yourself to-day,--you,\r\nwhose shape may be spanned by ten fingers. I hardly know you again."\r\n\r\nWe will relate hereafter the results of this discovery, which led to\r\ngreat and terrible events. At this moment, we will content ourselves\r\nwith stating, what the reader has no doubt already guessed, that\r\nFleur-de-Marie was the fruit of the secret marriage of Rodolph and\r\nSarah, and that they both believed their daughter dead.\r\n\r\nIt has not been forgotten that Rodolph, after having visited the house\r\nin the Rue du Temple, had returned home, and intended, in the evening,\r\nto be present at a ball given by the ---- ambassadress. It was to this\r\nfete that we shall follow his royal highness, the reigning Grand Duke of\r\nGerolstein, Gustavus Rodolph, travelling in France under the name of the\r\nCount de Duren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE BALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the eleventh hour of the night sounded from the different clocks in\r\nParis, the gates of an hotel in the Rue Plumet were thrown open by a\r\nSwiss in rich livery, and forthwith issued a magnificent dark blue\r\nBerlin carriage, drawn by two superb long-tailed gray horses; on the\r\nseat, which was covered by a rich hammercloth, trimmed with a mossy silk\r\nfringe, sat a portly-looking coachman, whose head was ornamented by a\r\nthree-cornered hat, while his rotund figure looked still more imposing\r\nin his dress livery-coat of blue cloth, trimmed up the seams with silver\r\nlace, and thickly braided with the same material; the whole finished by\r\na splendid sable collar and cuffs. Behind the carriage stood a tall\r\npowdered lacquey, dressed in a livery of blue turned up with yellow and\r\nsilver; and by his side was a chasseur, whose fierce-looking moustaches,\r\ngaily embroidered dress and hat, half concealed by a waving plume of\r\nblue and yellow feathers, completed a most imposing _coup-d\'oeil_.\r\n\r\nThe bright light of the lamps revealed the costly satin lining of the\r\ninterior of the vehicle we are describing, in which were seated Rodolph,\r\nhaving on his right hand the Baron de Grauen, and opposite to him the\r\nfaithful Murphy.\r\n\r\nOut of deference for the sovereign represented by the ambassador to\r\nwhose ball he was then proceeding, Rodolph wore no other mark of\r\ndistinction than the diamond order of ----.\r\n\r\nRound the neck of Sir Walter Murphy, and suspended by a broad orange\r\nriband, hung the enamelled cross of the grand commander of the Golden\r\nEagle of Gerolstein; and a similar insignia decorated the Baron de\r\nGrauen, amidst an infinite number of the crosses and badges of honour\r\nbelonging to all countries, depending by a gold chain placed in the two\r\nfull buttonholes of the diplomatist\'s coat.\r\n\r\n"I am delighted," said Rodolph, "with the very favourable accounts I\r\nhave received from Madame Georges respecting my poor little protegee at\r\nthe farm of Bouqueval. David\'s care and attention have worked wonders.\r\nApropos of La Goualeuse: what do you think, Sir Walter Murphy, any of\r\nyour Cite acquaintances would say at seeing you so strangely disguised,\r\nas at present they would consider you, most valiant charcoal-man, to be?\r\nThey would be somewhat astonished, I fancy."\r\n\r\n"Much in the same degree as the surprise your royal highness would\r\nexcite among your new acquaintances in the Rue du Temple, were you to\r\nproceed thither, as now attired, to pay a friendly visit to Madame\r\nPipelet, and to inquire after the health of Cabrion\'s victim, the poor\r\nmelancholy Alfred!"\r\n\r\n"My lord has drawn so lively a sketch of Alfred, attired in his\r\nlong-skirted green coat and bell-crowned hat," said the baron, "that I\r\ncan well imagine him seated in magisterial dignity in his dark and smoky\r\nlodge. Let me hope that your royal highness\'s visit to the Rue du Temple\r\nhas fully answered your expectations, and that you are in every way\r\nsatisfied with the researches of my agent?"\r\n\r\n"Perfectly so," answered Rodolph. "My success was even beyond my\r\nexpectations."\r\n\r\nThen, after a moment\'s painful silence, and to drive away the train of\r\nthought conjured up by the recollection of the probable guilt of Madame\r\nd\'Harville, he resumed, in a tone more gay:\r\n\r\n"I am almost ashamed to own to so much childishness, but I confess\r\nmyself amused with the contrast between my treating Madame Pipelet in\r\nthe morning to a glass of cordial, and then proceeding in the evening to\r\na grand fete, with all the pomp and prestige of one of those privileged\r\nbeings who, by the grace of God, \'reign over this lower world.\' Some men\r\nof small fortune would speak of my revenues as those of a millionaire,"\r\nadded Rodolph, in a sort of parenthesis, alluding to the limited extent\r\nof his estates.\r\n\r\n"And many millionaires, my lord, might not have the rare, the admirable\r\ngood sense, of the man of narrow means."\r\n\r\n"Ah, my dear De Grauen, you are really too good, much too good! You\r\nreally overwhelm me," replied Rodolph, with an ironical smile, while the\r\nbaron glanced at Murphy with the consciousness of a man who has just\r\ndiscovered he has been saying a foolish thing.\r\n\r\n"Really, my dear De Grauen," resumed Rodolph, "I know not how to\r\nacknowledge the weight of your compliment, or how to repay such delicate\r\nflattery in its own way."\r\n\r\n"My lord, let me entreat of you not to take the trouble," exclaimed the\r\nbaron, who had for the instant forgotten that Rodolph, who detested\r\nevery species of flattery, always revenged himself by the most unsparing\r\nraillery on those who, directly or indirectly, addressed it to him.\r\n\r\n"Nay, baron, I cannot allow myself to remain in your debt. You have\r\npraised my understanding,--I will, in return, admire your countenance;\r\nfor by my honour, as I sit beside you, you look like a youth of twenty.\r\nAntinous himself could not boast of finer features, or a more\r\ncaptivating expression."\r\n\r\n"My lord! my lord! I cry your mercy!"\r\n\r\n"Behold him, Murphy, and say whether Apollo could display more graceful\r\nlimbs, more light, and youthful proportions!"\r\n\r\n"I beseech you, my lord, to pardon me, from the recollection of how long\r\nit is since I have permitted myself to utter the slightest compliment to\r\nyour royal highness."\r\n\r\n"Observe, Murphy, this band of gold which restrains, without concealing,\r\nthe locks of rich black hair flowing over this graceful neck, and--"\r\n\r\n"My lord! my lord! for pity\'s sake spare me! I repent, most sincerely,\r\nof my involuntary fault," said the unfortunate baron, with an expression\r\nof comic despair on his countenance truly ludicrous.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that the original of this glowing picture was\r\nat least fifty years of age; his hair gray, frizzled and powdered; a\r\nstiff white cravat round his throat; a pale, withered countenance; and\r\ngolden spectacles upon the horny bridge of his sharp, projecting nose.\r\n\r\n"Pardon, my lord! pardon, for the baron," exclaimed the squire,\r\nlaughing. "I beseech you not to overwhelm him beneath the weight of your\r\nmythological allusions. I will be answerable to your royal highness that\r\nmy unlucky friend here will never again venture to utter a flattery,\r\nsince so truth is translated in the new vocabulary of Gerolstein."\r\n\r\n"What! old Murphy, too? Are you going to join in the rebellion against\r\nsincerity?"\r\n\r\n"My lord, I am so sorry for the position of my unfortunate _vis-a-vis_,\r\nthat--I beg I may divide his punishment with him."\r\n\r\n"Charcoal-man in ordinary, your disinterested friendship does you\r\nhonour. But seriously now, my dear De Grauen, how have you forgotten that\r\nI only allow such fellows as D\'Harneim and his train to flatter, for the\r\nsimple reason that they know not how to speak the truth? That\r\ncuckoo-note of false praise belongs to birds of such feather as\r\nthemselves, and the species they claim relationship with; but for a\r\nperson of your mind and good taste to descend to its usage--oh, fie!\r\nbaron, fie!"\r\n\r\n"It is all very well, my lord," said the baron, sturdily; "but I must be\r\nallowed to say (with all due apology for my boldness) that there is no\r\nsmall portion of pride in your royal highness\'s aversion to receive even\r\na just compliment."\r\n\r\n"Well said, baron! Come, I like you better now you speak plain truths.\r\nBut tell me how you prove your assertion?"\r\n\r\n"Why, just so, my lord; because you repudiate it upon the same principle\r\nthat might induce a beautiful woman, well aware of her charms, to say to\r\none of her most enthusiastic admirers, \'I know perfectly well how\r\nhandsome I am, and therefore your approval is perfectly uncalled for and\r\nunnecessary. What is the use of reiterating what everybody knows? Is it\r\nusual to proclaim in the open streets that the sun shines, when all may\r\nsee and feel certain of his midday brightness?\'"\r\n\r\n"Now, baron, you are shifting your ground, and becoming more dangerous\r\nas you become more adroit; and, by way of varying your punishment, I\r\nwill only say that the infernal Polidori himself could not have more\r\ningeniously disguised the poisonous draught of flattery, when seeking to\r\npersuade some poor victim to swallow it."\r\n\r\n"My lord, I am now effectually silenced."\r\n\r\n"Then," said Murphy (and this time with an air of real seriousness),\r\n"your royal highness has now no doubt as to its being really Polidori\r\nyou encountered in the Rue du Temple?"\r\n\r\n"I have ceased to have the least doubt on the subject, since I learned\r\nthrough you that he had been in Paris for some time past."\r\n\r\n"I had forgotten, or, rather, purposely omitted to mention to your\r\nlordship," said Murphy in a sorrowing tone, "a name that never failed to\r\nawaken painful feelings; and knowing as I do how justly odious the\r\nremembrance of this man was to your royal highness, I studiously\r\nabstained from all reference to it."\r\n\r\nThe features of Rodolph were again overshadowed with gloom, and, plunged\r\nin deep reverie, he continued to preserve unbroken the silence which\r\nprevailed until the carriage stopped in the courtyard of the embassy.\r\nThe windows of the hotel were blazing with a thousand lights, which\r\nshone brightly through the thick darkness of the night, while a crowd of\r\nlacqueys, in full-dress liveries, lined the entrance-hall, extending\r\neven to the salons of reception, where the grooms of the chamber waited\r\nto announce the different arrivals.\r\n\r\nM. le Comte ----, the ambassador, with his lady, had purposely remained\r\nin the first reception-room until the arrival of Rodolph, who now\r\nentered, followed by Murphy and M. de Grauen.\r\n\r\nRodolph was then in his thirty-sixth year, in the very prime and\r\nperfection of manly health and strength. His regular and handsome\r\nfeatures, with the air of dignity pervading his whole appearance, would\r\nhave rendered him, under any circumstances, a strikingly attractive man;\r\nbut, combined with the _eclat_ of high birth and exalted rank, he was a\r\nperson of first-rate importance in every circle in which he presented\r\nhimself, and whose notice was assiduously sought for. Dressed with the\r\nutmost simplicity, Rodolph wore a white waistcoat and cravat; a blue\r\ncoat, buttoned up closely, on the right breast of which sparkled a\r\ndiamond star, displayed to admiration the light yet perfect proportions\r\nof his graceful figure, while his well-fitting pantaloons, of black\r\nkerseymere, defined the finely formed leg and handsome foot in its\r\nembroidered stocking.\r\n\r\nFrom the rareness of the Grand Duke\'s visits to the _haut monde_, his\r\narrival produced a great sensation, and every eye was fixed upon him\r\nfrom the moment that, attended by Murphy and Baron de Grauen, he entered\r\nthe first salon at the embassy. An attache, deputed to watch for his\r\narrival, hastened immediately to appraise the ambassadress of the\r\nappearance of her illustrious guest. Her excellency instantly hurried,\r\nwith her noble husband, to welcome their visitor, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n"Your royal highness is, indeed, kind, thus to honour our poor\r\nentertainment."\r\n\r\n"Nay, madame," replied Rodolph, gracefully bowing on the hand extended\r\nto him, "your ladyship is well aware of the sincere pleasure it affords\r\nto pay my compliments to yourself; and as for M. le Comte, he and I are\r\ntwo old friends, who are always delighted to meet. Are we not, my lord?"\r\n\r\n"Your royal highness, in deigning to continue to me so flattering a\r\nplace in your recollection, makes it still more impossible for me ever\r\nto forget your many acts of condescending kindness."\r\n\r\n"I assure you, M. le Comte, that in my memory the past never dies; or,\r\nat least, the pleasant part of it; for I make it a strict rule never to\r\npreserve any reminiscences of my friends but such as are agreeable and\r\ngratifying."\r\n\r\n"Your royal highness has found the secret of being happy in your\r\nthoughts, and rendering others so at the same time," rejoined the\r\nambassador, smiling with gratified pride and pleasure at a conference so\r\ncordially carried on before a gathering crowd of admiring auditors.\r\n\r\n"Thus, then, madame," replied Rodolph, "will your flattering reception\r\nof to-night live long in my memory; and I shall promise myself the\r\nhappiness of recalling this evening\'s fete, with its tasteful\r\narrangements and crowd of attending beauties. Ah, Madame la Comtesse,\r\nwho like you can effect such a union of taste and elegance as now\r\nsparkles around us?"\r\n\r\n"Your royal highness is too indulgent."\r\n\r\n"But I have a very important question to ask you: Why is it that,\r\nlovely as are your fair guests, their charms are never seen to such\r\nperfection as when assembled beneath your hospitable roof?"\r\n\r\n"Your royal highness is pleased to view our fair visitants through the\r\nsame flattering medium with which you are graciously pleased to behold\r\nour poor endeavours for your and their amusement," answered the\r\nambassador, with a deferential bow.\r\n\r\n"Your pardon, count," replied Rodolph, "if I differ with you in opinion.\r\nAccording to my judgment, the cause proceeds wholly from our amiable\r\nhostess, Madame l\'Ambassadrice."\r\n\r\n"May I request of your royal highness to solve this enigma?" inquired\r\nthe countess, smiling.\r\n\r\n"That is easily given, madame, and may be found in the perfect urbanity\r\nand exquisite grace with which you receive your lovely guests, and\r\nwhisper to each a few charming and encouraging words, which, if the\r\nleast bit exceeding strict truth," said Rodolph, smiling with\r\ngood-tempered satire, "renders those who are even praised above their\r\nmerits more radiant in beauty from your kind commendations, while those\r\nwhose charms admit of no exaggeration are no less radiant with the\r\nhappiness of finding themselves so justly appreciated by you; thus each\r\ncountenance, thanks to the gentle arts you practise, is made to exhibit\r\nthe most smiling delight, for perfect content will set off even homely\r\nfeatures. And thus I account for why it is that woman, all lovely as she\r\nis, never looks so much so as when seen beneath your roof. Come, M.\r\nl\'Ambassadeur, own that I have made out a good case, and that you\r\nentirely concur with me in opinion."\r\n\r\n"Your royal highness has afforded me too many previous reasons to admire\r\nand adopt your opinions for me to hesitate in the present instance."\r\n\r\n"And for me, my lord," said the countess, "at the risk of being included\r\namong those fair ladies who get a little more praise or flattery (which\r\nwas it your highness styled it?) than they deserve, I accept your very\r\nflattering explanation with as much qualified pleasure as if it were\r\nreally founded on truth."\r\n\r\n"In order more effectually to convince you, madame, that nothing is more\r\ncorrect than all I have asserted, let us make a few observations\r\ntouching the fine effect of praise in animating and lighting up the\r\ncountenance."\r\n\r\n"Ah, my lord, you are laying a very mischievous snare for me," said the\r\ncountess, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I will abandon that idea; but upon one condition, that you\r\nhonour me by taking my arm. I have been told wonderful things of a\r\n\'Winter Garden,\'--a work from Fairyland. May I put up my humble petition\r\nto be allowed to see this new wonder of a \'hundred and one nights?\'"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my lord, with the utmost pleasure. But I see that your highness had\r\nreceived a most exaggerated account. Perhaps you will accompany me, and\r\njudge for yourself. Only in this instance I would fain hope that your\r\nhabitual indulgence may induce you to feel as little disappointment as\r\npossible at finding how imperfectly the reality equals your\r\nexpectations."\r\n\r\nThe ambassadress then took the offered arm of Rodolph, and proceeded\r\nwith him to the other salons, while the count remained conversing with\r\nthe Baron de Grauen and Murphy, whom he had been acquainted with for some\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAnd a more beautiful scene of enchantment never charmed the eye than\r\nthat presented by the aspect of the winter garden, to which Rodolph had\r\nconducted his noble hostess. Let the reader imagine an enclosure of\r\nabout forty feet in length, and thirty in width (leading out of a long\r\nand splendid gallery), surmounted by a glazed and vaulted roof, the\r\nbuilding being securely covered in for about fifty feet. Round the\r\nparallelogram it described, the walls were concealed by an infinite\r\nnumber of mirrors, over which was placed a small and delicate trellis of\r\nfine green rushes, which, thanks to the strong light reflected on the\r\nhighly polished glass, resembled an arbour, and were almost entirely\r\nhidden by a thick row of orange-trees, as large as those of the\r\nTuileries, mixed with camellias of equal size; while the golden fruit\r\nand verdant foliage of the one contrasted beautifully with the rich\r\nclusters of waxen flowers, of all colours, with which the other was\r\nloaded. The remainder of the garden was thus devised:\r\n\r\nFive or six enormous clumps of trees, and Indian or other tropical\r\nshrubs, planted in immense cases filled with peat earth, were surrounded\r\nby alleys paved with a mosaic shell-work, and sufficiently wide for two\r\nor three persons to walk abreast. It is impossible to describe the\r\nwondrous effect produced by this rich display of tropical vegetation in\r\nthe midst of a European winter, and almost in the very centre of a\r\nballroom. Here might be seen gigantic bananas stretching their tall arms\r\nto the glass roof which covered them, and blending the vivid green of\r\ntheir palms with the lanceolated leaves of the large magnolias, some of\r\nwhich already displayed their matchless and odoriferous flowers with\r\ntheir bell-shaped calices, purple without and silvery white within, from\r\nwhich started forth the little gold-threaded stamens. At a little\r\ndistance were grouped the palm and date-trees of the Levant; the red\r\nmacaw, and fig-trees from India; all blooming in full health and vigour,\r\nand displaying their foliage in all its luxuriance, gave to the _tout\r\nensemble_ a mass of rich, brilliant tropical verdure, which, glittering\r\namong the thousand lights, sparkled with the colours of the emerald.\r\n\r\nAlong the trellising, between the orange-trees, and amid the clumps,\r\nwere trained every variety of rare climbing plants; sometimes hanging\r\ntheir long wreaths of leaves and flowers in graceful festoons, then\r\ndepending like blooming serpents from the tall boughs; now trailing at\r\ntheir roots, then ambitiously scaling the very walls, till they hung\r\ntheir united tresses round the transparent and vaulted roof, from which\r\nagain they floated in mingled masses, waving in the pure, light breeze\r\nloaded with so many odours. The winged pomegranate, the passion-flower,\r\nwith its large purple flowers striated with azure, and crowned with its\r\ndark violet tuft, waved in long spiral wreaths over the heads of the\r\nadmiring crowd, then, as though fatigued with the sport, threw their\r\ncolossal garlands of delicate flowers across the hard, prickly leaves of\r\nthe gigantic aloes.\r\n\r\nThe bignonia of India, with its long, cup-shaped flower of dark sulphur\r\ncolour, and slight, slender leaves, was placed beside the delicate\r\nflesh-coloured petals of the stephanotis, so justly appreciated for its\r\nexquisite perfume; the two stems mutually clinging to each other for\r\nsupport, and mingling their leaves and flowers in one confused mass,\r\ndisposed them in elegant festoons of green fringe spangled with gold and\r\nsilver spots, around the immense velvet foliage of the Indian fig.\r\nFarther on, started forth, and then fell again in a sort of variegated\r\nand floral cascade, immense quantities of the stalks of the asclepias,\r\nwhose leaves, large, umbellated, and in clusters of from fifteen to\r\ntwenty star-shaped flowers, grew so thickly, so evenly, that they might\r\nhave been mistaken for bouquets of pink enamel surrounded with leaves of\r\nfine green porcelain. The borders of the cases containing the orange\r\nsand camellias were filled with the choicest cape heaths, the tulips of\r\nThol, the narcissus of Constantinople, the hyacinth, irides, and\r\ncyclamina of Persia; forming a sort of natural carpet, presenting one\r\nharmonious blending of the loveliest tints.\r\n\r\nChinese lanterns of transparent silk, some pale blue, others pink,\r\npartly concealed amid the foliage, threw a soft and gentle light over\r\nthis enchanting scene; nor could a more ingenious idea have been\r\nresorted to than in the happy amalgamation of these two colours, by\r\nwhich a charming and almost unearthly light was produced combining the\r\nclear cerulean blue of a summer\'s night with the rose-coloured\r\ncoruscations emitted from sparkling rays of an aurora borealis.\r\n\r\nThe entrance to this immense hothouse was from a long gallery glittering\r\nwith gold, with mirrors, crystal vases filled with the choicest\r\nperfumes, and brilliantly lighted, and also raised a few steps above the\r\nfairy palace we have been endeavouring to describe. The dazzling\r\nbrightness of the approach served as a sort of penumbra, in which were\r\nindistinctly traced out the gigantic exotics discernible through a\r\nspecies of arch, partly concealed by two crimson velvet curtains looped\r\nback with golden cords so as to give a dim and misty view of the\r\nenchanted land that lay beyond. An imaginative mind might easily have\r\npersuaded himself he stood near a huge window opening on some beautiful\r\nAsiatic landscape during the tranquillity of a summer\'s twilight.\r\n\r\nThe sounds of the orchestra, weakened by distance, and broken by the\r\njoyous hum proceeding from the gallery, died languidly away among the\r\nmotionless foliage of the huge trees. Insensibly each fresh visitant to\r\nthis enchanting spot lowered his voice until his words fell in whispers;\r\nfor the light genuine air, embalmed with a thousand rich odours,\r\nappeared to cast a sort of somnolency over the senses; every breath\r\nseemed to speak of the clustering plants whose balmy sweetness filled\r\nthe atmosphere. Certainly two lovers, seated in some corner of this\r\nEden, could conceive no greater happiness to be enjoyed on earth, than\r\nthus dreamily to rest beneath the trees and flowers of this terrestrial\r\nparadise.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this winter garden were placed immense divans beneath\r\ncanopies of leaves and flowers; the subdued light of the hothouse\r\nforming a powerful contrast with the gallery, the distance seemed filled\r\nwith a species of gold-coloured, shining fog, in the midst of which\r\nglittered and flickered, like a living embroidery, the dazzling and\r\nvaried robes of the ladies, combined with the prismatic scintillations\r\nof the congregated mass of diamonds and precious stones. Rodolph\'s first\r\nsensation upon arriving at this enchanting triumph of art over nature\r\nwas that of most unfeigned surprise.\r\n\r\n"This is, indeed, a wonderfully beautiful carrying out of a poetical\r\nidea," said he, almost involuntarily; then, turning to the ambassadress,\r\nhe exclaimed, "Madame, till now, I had not deemed such wonders\r\npracticable. We have not in the scene before us a mere union of\r\nunbounded expense with the most exquisite taste, but you give us poetry\r\nin action. Instead of writing as a master poet, or painting as a\r\nfirst-rate artist, you create that which they would scarcely venture to\r\ndream of."\r\n\r\n"Your royal highness is too indulgent."\r\n\r\n"Nay, but candidly, all must agree that the mind which could so\r\nfaithfully depict this ravishing scene, with its charm of colours and\r\ncontrasts,--beyond us, the loud notes of joy and mirthful revelry, here\r\nthe soft silence and sweet, gentle murmurs of distant voices, that lull\r\nthe spirit into a fancied flight beyond this fitful existence,--surely,\r\nsurely, without suspicion of flattery, it may be said of the planner and\r\ncontriver of all this, such a one was born a poet and a painter\r\ncombined."\r\n\r\n"The praises of your royal highness are so much the more dangerous from\r\nthe skill and cleverness with which they are uttered, and which makes us\r\nlisten to them with delight, even in defiance of our sternest\r\nresolutions. But allow me to call your royal highness\'s attention to the\r\nvery lovely person who is approaching us. I must have you admit that the\r\nMarquise d\'Harville must shine preeminently beautiful any and every\r\nwhere. Is she not graceful? And does not the gentle elegance of her\r\nwhole appearance acquire a fresh charm, from the contrast with the\r\nsevere yet classic beauty by whom she is accompanied?"\r\n\r\nThe individuals thus alluded to were the Countess Sarah Macgregor and\r\nthe Marquise d\'Harville, who were at this moment descending the steps\r\nwhich led from the gallery to the winter garden. Neither was the\r\npanegyric bestowed by the ambassadress on Madame d\'Harville at all\r\nexaggerated. No words can accurately describe the loveliness of her\r\nperson, and the Marquise d\'Harville was then in the first bloom of\r\nyouthful charms; but her beauty, delicate and fragile as it was,\r\nappeared less to belong to the strict regularity of her features than to\r\nthe irresistible expression of sweetness and universal kindness, which\r\nimparted a charm to her countenance impossible to resist or to describe;\r\nand this peculiar charm served invariably to distinguish Madame\r\nd\'Harville from all other fashionable beauties; for goodness of heart\r\nand kindliness of disposition are but rarely seen as the prevailing\r\npassions revealed in a face as fair, as young, high-born, and ardently\r\nworshipped by all, as was the Marquise d\'Harville, who shone forth in\r\nall her lustre as the brightest star in the galaxy of fashion. Too wise,\r\nvirtuous, and right-minded to listen to the host of flatterers by whom\r\nshe was surrounded, Madame d\'Harville smiled as gratefully on all as\r\nthough she could have given them credit for speaking the truth, had not\r\nher own modest opinion of her just claims to such homage have forbidden\r\nher accepting of praise she never could have deserved. Wholly\r\nindifferent to flattery, yet sensibly alive to kindness, she perfectly\r\ndistinguished between sympathy and insincerity. Her acute penetration,\r\ncorrect judgment, and lively wit, unmixed by the slightest ill-nature,\r\nmade her wage an early, though good-tempered war with those vain and\r\negotistical beings who crowd and oppress society with the view of\r\nmonopolising general attention, and, blinded by their own self-love,\r\nexpect one universal deference and submission.\r\n\r\n"Those kind of persons," said Madame d\'Harville one day, laughingly,\r\n"appear to me as if their whole lives were passed in dancing \'_Le\r\nCavalier Seul_\' before an invisible mirror."\r\n\r\nAn unassuming and unpretending person, however reserved and consequently\r\nunpopular he might be with others, was sure to find a steady friend and\r\npartial observer in Madame d\'Harville.\r\n\r\nThis trifling digression is absolutely essential to the right\r\nunderstanding of facts of which we shall speak hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe complexion of Madame d\'Harville was of the purest white, tinged with\r\nthe most delicate carnation; her long tresses of bright chestnut hair\r\nfloated over her beautifully formed shoulders, white and polished as\r\nmarble. It would be an impossible task to describe her large dark gray\r\neyes, fringed with their thick lashes, and beaming with angelic\r\nsweetness; her coral lips, with their gentle smile, gave to her eyes the\r\nindefinable charm that her affable and winning mode of expressing\r\nherself derived from their mild and angelic expression of approving\r\ngoodness. We will not farther delay the reader by describing the\r\nperfection of her figure, nor dwell upon the distinguished air which\r\nmarked her whole appearance. She wore a white crape dress, trimmed with\r\nthe natural flowers of the camellia, intermixed with its own rich green\r\nleaves. Here and there a diamond sparkled among the waxy petals, as if a\r\ndewdrop fresh from its native skies had fallen there. A garland of the\r\nsame flowers, equally ornamented with precious stones, was placed with\r\ninfinite grace upon her fair and open brow.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar style of the Countess Sarah Macgregor\'s beauty served to\r\nset off the fair feminine loveliness of her companion. Though turned\r\nthirty-five years of age, Sarah looked much younger. Nothing appears to\r\npreserve the body more effectually from all the attacks of sickness or\r\ndecay than a cold-hearted, egotistical disregard of every one but\r\nourselves; it encrusts the body with a cold, icy covering, which alike\r\nresists the inroads of bodily or mental wear and tear. To this cause may\r\nbe ascribed the wonderful preservation of Countess Sarah\'s appearance.\r\n\r\nThe lady whose name we last mentioned wore a dress of pale amber watered\r\nsilk, beneath a crape tunic of the same colour. A simple wreath of the\r\ndark leaves of the _Pyrus Japonicus_ encircled her head, and harmonised\r\nadmirably with the bandeaux of raven hair it confined. This classically\r\nsevere mode of head-dress gave to the profile of this imperious woman\r\nthe character and resemblance of an antique statue. Many persons,\r\nmistaking their real cast of countenance, imagine some peculiar vocation\r\ndelineated in their traits. Thus one man, who fancies he possesses a\r\nwarlike air, assumes the warrior; another imagines\r\n\r\n      "His eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,"\r\n\r\nmarks him out as a poet; instantly he turns down his shirt-collar,\r\nadopts poetical language, and writes himself poet. So the self-imagined\r\nconspirator wastes days and hours in pondering over mighty deeds he\r\nfeels called upon to do. The politician, upon the same terms, bores the\r\nworld and his friends with his perpetual outpourings upon political\r\neconomy; and the man whose saintly turn of countenance persuades its\r\nowner into the belief of a corresponding character within, forthwith\r\nabjures the pomps and vanities of the world, and aims at reforming his\r\nbrethren by his pulpit eloquence. Now, ambition being Sarah\'s ruling\r\npassion, and her noble and aristocratical features well assisting the\r\ndelusion, she smiled as the word "diadem" crossed her thoughts, and lent\r\na willing ear to the predictions of her Highland nurse, and firmly\r\nbelieved herself predestined to a sovereign destiny. Spite of the\r\ntrifling embonpoint that gave to her figure (which, though fatter than\r\nMadame d\'Harville\'s, was not less slender and nymph-like) a voluptuous\r\ngracefulness, Sarah boasted of all the freshness of early youth, and few\r\ncould long sustain the fire of her black and piercing eyes; her nose was\r\naquiline; her finely formed mouth and rich ruby lips were expressive of\r\nthe highest determination, haughtiness, and pride.\r\n\r\nThe marquise and Sarah had recognised Rodolph in the winter garden at\r\nthe moment they were descending into it from the gallery; but the prince\r\nfeigned not to observe their presence.\r\n\r\n"The prince is so absorbed with the ambassadress," said Madame\r\nd\'Harville to Sarah, "that he pays not the slightest attention to us."\r\n\r\n"You are quite mistaken, my dear Clemence," rejoined the countess; "the\r\nprince saw us as quickly and as plainly as we saw him, but I frightened\r\nhim away; you see he still bears malice with me."\r\n\r\n"I am more than ever at a loss to understand the singular obstinacy with\r\nwhich he persists in shunning you,--you, formerly an old friend.\r\n\'Countess Sarah and myself are sworn enemies,\' replied he to me once in\r\na joking manner; \'I have made a vow never to speak to her; and you may\r\njudge how sacred must be the vow that hinders me from conversing with so\r\ncharming a lady.\' And, strange and unaccountable as was this reply, I\r\nhad no alternative but to submit to it."\r\n\r\n"And yet I can assure you that the cause of this deadly feud, half in\r\njest, and half in earnest as it is, originates in the most simple\r\ncircumstance. Were it not that a third party is implicated in it, I\r\nshould have explained the whole to you long ago. But what is the matter,\r\nmy dear child? You seem as though your thoughts were far from the\r\npresent scene."\r\n\r\n"Nothing, nothing, I assure you," replied the marquise, faintly; "but\r\nthe gallery is so very hot, it gave me a violent headache. Let us sit\r\ndown here for a minute or two. I hope and believe it will soon be\r\nbetter."\r\n\r\n"You are right; see, here is a nice quiet corner, where you will be in\r\nperfect safety from the researches of those who are lamenting your\r\nabsence," added Sarah, pronouncing the last words with marked emphasis.\r\n\r\nThe two ladies then seated themselves on a divan, almost concealed\r\nbeneath the clustering shrubs and overhanging plants.\r\n\r\n"I said those who would be lamenting your absence, my dear\r\nClemence,--come, own that I deserve praise for so discreetly forming my\r\nspeech."\r\n\r\nThe marquise blushed slightly, cast down her eyes, but spoke not.\r\n\r\n"How unreasonable you are!" exclaimed Sarah, in a tone of friendly\r\nreproach. "Can you not trust me, my dear child?--yes, child; for am I\r\nnot old enough to be your mother?"\r\n\r\n"Not trust you?" uttered the marquise, sadly; "alas! have I not on the\r\ncontrary confessed that to you which I should hardly have dared to own\r\nto myself?"\r\n\r\n"Well, then, come, rouse yourself; now, let us have a little talk about\r\nhim: and so you have really sworn to drive him to despair?"\r\n\r\n"For the love of heaven," exclaimed Madame d\'Harville, "think what you\r\nare saying!"\r\n\r\n"I tell you I know him better than you do, my poor child; he is a man of\r\ncool and decided energy, who sets but little value on his life; he has\r\nhad misfortunes enough to make him quite weary of it; and it really\r\nseems as if you daily found greater pleasure in tormenting him, and\r\nplaying with his feelings."\r\n\r\n"Is it possible you can really think so?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed, in spite of myself, I cannot refrain from entertaining that\r\nopinion. Oh, if you but knew how over-susceptible some minds are\r\nrendered by a continuance of sorrows and afflictions,--just now I saw\r\ntwo large tears fall from his eyes, as he gazed on you."\r\n\r\n"Are you quite sure of what you say?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I am quite certain; and that, too, in a ballroom, at the risk\r\nof becoming an object of general derision, if this uncontrollable misery\r\nwere perceived! Ah! let me tell you, a person must truly love to bear\r\nall this, and even to be careless about concealing his sufferings from\r\nthe world."\r\n\r\n"For the love of heaven, do not speak thus!" replied Madame d\'Harville,\r\nin a voice trembling with emotion. "Alas! you have touched me nearly; I\r\nknow too well what it is to struggle with a hidden grief, yet wear an\r\noutward expression of calmness and resignation. Alas! alas! \'tis the\r\ndeep pity and commiseration I feel for him has been my ruin," added she,\r\nalmost unconsciously.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! What an over-nice person you are, to talk of a little\r\ninnocent flirtation being ruinous, and that, too, with a man so\r\nscrupulously guarded as to abstain from ever appearing in your husband\'s\r\npresence, for fear of compromising you. You must admit that M. Charles\r\nRobert is a man of surprising honour, delicacy, and real feeling. I feel\r\nthe more inclined to espouse his cause from the recollection that you\r\nhave never met him elsewhere but at my house, and because I can answer\r\nfor his principles, and that his devoted attachment to you can only be\r\nequalled by the deep respect he bears you."\r\n\r\n"I have never doubted the many noble qualities you have so repeatedly\r\nassured me he possesses, but you know well that it is his long\r\nsuccession of bitter afflictions which have so warmly interested me in\r\nhis favour."\r\n\r\n"And well does he merit this interest, and most fully do his excellent\r\nqualities absolve you of all blame in thus bestowing it. Surely so fine\r\nand noble a countenance bespeaks a mind equally superior to all mankind.\r\nHow completely are you reminded, while gazing on his tall and finely\r\nproportioned figure, of the _preux chevaliers_ of bygone days,\'_sans\r\npeur et sans reproche_.\' I once saw him dressed in his uniform as\r\ncommandant of the national guard, and, handsome as he is, I really\r\nthink he looked surpassingly well, and I could but say to myself, that,\r\nif nobility were the award of inward merit and external beauty, M.\r\nCharles Robert, instead of being so called, would take precedence of\r\nnearly all our dukes and peers. Would he not be a fitting representative\r\nof any of the most distinguished families in France?"\r\n\r\n"You know, my dear countess, how very little importance I attach to mere\r\nbirth, and you yourself have frequently reproached me with being\r\nstrongly inclined to republicanism," said Madame d\'Harville, smiling\r\ngently.\r\n\r\n"For my own part, I always thought, with you, that M. Charles Robert\r\nrequired not the aid of rank or titles to render him worthy of universal\r\nadmiration. Then, what extreme talent he possesses! What a fine voice he\r\nhas! And what delightful morning concerts we three have been able to\r\nachieve, owing to his all-powerful assistance! Ah, my dear Clemence, do\r\nyou remember the first time you ever sang with him: what passionate\r\nexpression did he not throw into the words of that beautiful duet, so\r\ndescriptive of his love, and his fear of offending her who was the\r\nobject of it, by revealing it?"\r\n\r\n"Let me entreat of you," said Madame d\'Harville, after a long silence,\r\n"to speak of something else; indeed I dare not listen further: what you\r\nbut just now intimated of his depressed and unhappy appearance has\r\ncaused me much pain."\r\n\r\n"Nay, my dear friend, I meant not to grieve you, but merely to point out\r\nthe probability that a man, rendered doubly sensitive by the succession\r\nof past misfortunes, might feel his courage insufficient to encounter\r\nthe fresh trial of your rejection of his suit, and thus be induced to\r\nend his hopeless love and his life together."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no more! no more!" almost shrieked Madame d\'Harville, interrupting\r\nSarah; "this fearful idea has glanced across my mind already." Then,\r\nafter a second silence of some minutes, the marquise resumed, "Let us,\r\nas I said before, talk of somebody else,--of your mortal enemy, for\r\ninstance," added she, with assumed gaiety of manner; "come, we will take\r\nthe prince for a fresh theme of conversation; I had not seen him,\r\npreviously to this evening, for a very long time. Do you know that I\r\nthink he looks handsomer than ever? Though all but king, he has lost\r\nnone of the winning sweetness and affability of his manner, and, spite\r\nof my republicanism, I must confess I have seldom, if ever, known so\r\nirresistible a person."\r\n\r\nSarah threw a side glance of deep and scrutinising hatred upon her\r\nunconscious rival, but, quickly recovering herself, she said, gaily:\r\n\r\n"Now, my dear Clemence, you must confess to being a most capricious\r\nlittle lady; you have regular alternating paroxysms of admiration and\r\nviolent dislike for the prince; why, a few months ago, I mean about his\r\nfirst arrival here, you were so captivated by him, that, between\r\nourselves, I was half afraid you had lost your heart past all hope of\r\nrecall."\r\n\r\n"Thanks to you," replied Madame d\'Harville, smiling, "my admiration was\r\nvery short-lived; for so well did you act up to your character of the\r\nprince\'s sworn foe, and such fearful tales did you tell me of his\r\nprofligacy and misconduct, that you succeeded in inspiring me with an\r\naversion as powerful as had been the infatuation which led you to fear\r\nfor the safety of my heart; which, by the way, I cannot think would ever\r\nhave been placed in any danger from the attempts of your enemy to\r\ndisturb its repose, since, shortly before you gave me those frightful\r\nparticulars of the prince\'s character, he had quite ceased to honour me\r\nwith his visits, although on the most intimate and friendly terms with\r\nmy husband."\r\n\r\n"Talking of your husband, pray is he here to-night?" inquired Sarah.\r\n\r\n"No," replied Madame d\'Harville, in a tone of embarrassment; "he\r\npreferred remaining at home."\r\n\r\n"He seems to me to mix less and less in the world."\r\n\r\n"He never liked what is called fashionable gaiety."\r\n\r\nThe marquise\'s agitation visibly increased; and Sarah, whose quick eye\r\neasily perceived it, continued:\r\n\r\n"The last time I saw him he looked even paler than usual."\r\n\r\n"He has been very much out of health lately."\r\n\r\n"My dearest Clemence, will you permit me to speak to you without\r\nreserve?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, pray do!"\r\n\r\n"How comes it that the least allusion to your husband always throws you\r\ninto such a state of extraordinary alarm and uneasiness?"\r\n\r\n"What an idea! Is it possible you can mean it seriously?" asked poor\r\nMadame d\'Harville, trying to smile.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I am quite in earnest," rejoined her companion; "whenever you\r\nare speaking of him, your countenance assumes, even in spite of\r\nyourself,--but how shall I make myself understood?" and Sarah, with the\r\ntone and fixed gaze of one who wished to read the most secret thoughts\r\nof the person she addressed, slowly and emphatically added, "a look of\r\nmingled aversion and fear!"\r\n\r\nThe fixed pallid features of Madame d\'Harville at first defied even\r\nSarah\'s practised eye, but her keen gaze soon detected a slight\r\nconvulsive working of the mouth, with a tremulous movement of the under\r\nlip of her victim; but feeling it unsafe to pursue the subject farther\r\nat this moment so as to awaken the marquise\'s mistrust of her friendly\r\nintentions, by way, therefore, of concealing her real suspicions, she\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n"Yes, just that sort of dislike any woman would entertain for a peevish,\r\njealous, ill-tempered--"\r\n\r\nAt this explanation of the countess\'s meaning, as regarded Madame\r\nd\'Harville\'s imagined dislike for her husband, a heavy load seemed\r\ntaken from her; the working of her lip ceased, and she replied:\r\n\r\n"Let me assure you M. d\'Harville is neither peevish nor jealous." Then,\r\nas if searching for some means of breaking a conversation so painful to\r\nher feelings, she suddenly exclaimed, "Ah! here comes that tiresome\r\nfriend of my husband\'s, the Duke de Lucenay. I hope he has not seen us.\r\nWhere can he have sprung from? I thought he was a thousand miles off!"\r\n\r\n"It was reported that he had gone somewhere in the East for a year or\r\ntwo, and behold, at the end of five months, here he is back again! His\r\nunexpected arrival must have sadly annoyed the Duchess de Lucenay,\r\nthough poor De Lucenay is a very inoffensive creature," said Sarah, with\r\nan ill-natured smile. "Nor will Madame de Lucenay be the only one to\r\nfeel vexation at his thus changing his mind; her friend, M. de St. Remy,\r\nwill duly and affectionately sympathise in all her regrets on the\r\nsubject."\r\n\r\n"Come, come, my dear Sarah, I cannot allow you to scandalise; say that\r\nthis return of M. de Lucenay is a nuisance to everybody; the duke is\r\nsufficiently disagreeable for you to generalise the regret his\r\nunexpected presence occasions."\r\n\r\n"I do not slander, I merely repeat. It is also said that M. de St. Remy,\r\nthe model of our young _elegantes_, whose splendid doings have filled\r\nall Paris, is all but ruined! \'Tis true, he has by no means reduced\r\neither his establishment or his expenditure; however, there are several\r\nways of accounting for that; in the first place, Madame de Lucenay is\r\nimmensely rich."\r\n\r\n"What a horrible idea!"\r\n\r\n"Still I only repeat what others say. There, the duke sees us; he is\r\ncoming towards us; we must resign ourselves to our fate,--miserable, is\r\nit not? I know nothing so hard to bear as that man\'s company; he makes\r\nhimself so very disagreeable, and then laughs so disgustingly loud at\r\nthe silly things he says. Indeed, he is so boisterous that the bare idea\r\nof him makes one think of pretending to faint, or any other pretext, to\r\navoid him. Talking of fainting, pray let me beg of you, if you have the\r\nleast regard for your fan or essence-bottle, to beware how you allow him\r\nto handle either, for he has the unfortunate habit of breaking whatever\r\nhe touches, and all with the most facetious self-satisfied air\r\nimaginable."\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME I.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\nTranscriber\'s Notes:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis e-text was prepared from numbered edition 505 of the 1000 printed.\r\n\r\nMinor punctuation and capitalization corrections have been made without\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\nMinor typographical errors of single words, otherwise spelled correctly\r\nthroughout the text have been made without comment.\r\n\r\nWord Variations appearing in the original text which have been retained:\r\n\r\n"bull-dog" (1) and "bulldog" (2)\r\n"protege" (1), "protegee" (8) and "proteges" (1)\r\n"rencontre" (2) and "rencounter" (1)\r\n"Sarah Seyton of Halsburg" (1) and "Sarah Seyton of Halsbury" (1)\r\n\r\nWords using the [oe] ligature, which have been herein represented as\r\n"oe": "manoeuvre", "coeur", "chef-d\'oeuvre", "coup-d\'oeil".\r\n\r\nThroughout the text, illustrations and their captions were placed on\r\nfacing pages.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
