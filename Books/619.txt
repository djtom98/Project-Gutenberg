Septimus Harding was, a few years since, a beneficed\r\nclergyman residing in the cathedral town of ----; let us call it\r\nBarchester.  Were we to name Wells or Salisbury, Exeter, Hereford, or\r\nGloucester, it might be presumed that something personal was intended;\r\nand as this tale will refer mainly to the cathedral dignitaries of the\r\ntown in question, we are anxious that no personality may be suspected.\r\nLet us presume that Barchester is a quiet town in the West of England,\r\nmore remarkable for the beauty of its cathedral and the antiquity of\r\nits monuments than for any commercial prosperity; that the west end\r\nof Barchester is the cathedral close, and that the aristocracy of\r\nBarchester are the bishop, dean, and canons, with their respective\r\nwives and daughters.\r\n\r\nEarly in life Mr Harding found himself located at Barchester.  A fine\r\nvoice and a taste for sacred music had decided the position in which\r\nhe was to exercise his calling, and for many years he performed the\r\neasy but not highly paid duties of a minor canon.  At the age of forty\r\na small living in the close vicinity of the town increased both his\r\nwork and his income, and at the age of fifty he became precentor of\r\nthe cathedral.\r\n\r\nMr Harding had married early in life, and was the father of two\r\ndaughters.  The eldest, Susan, was born soon after his marriage; the\r\nother, Eleanor, not till ten years later.\r\n\r\nAt the time at which we introduce him to our readers he was living as\r\nprecentor at Barchester with his youngest daughter, then twenty-four\r\nyears of age; having been many years a widower, and having married his\r\neldest daughter to a son of the bishop a very short time before his\r\ninstallation to the office of precentor.\r\n\r\nScandal at Barchester affirmed that had it not been for the beauty of\r\nhis daughter, Mr Harding would have remained a minor canon; but here\r\nprobably Scandal lied, as she so often does; for even as a minor canon\r\nno one had been more popular among his reverend brethren in the close\r\nthan Mr Harding; and Scandal, before she had reprobated Mr Harding for\r\nbeing made precentor by his friend the bishop, had loudly blamed the\r\nbishop for having so long omitted to do something for his friend Mr\r\nHarding.  Be this as it may, Susan Harding, some twelve years since,\r\nhad married the Rev. Dr Theophilus Grantly, son of the bishop,\r\narchdeacon of Barchester, and rector of Plumstead Episcopi, and her\r\nfather became, a few months later, precentor of Barchester Cathedral,\r\nthat office being, as is not unusual, in the bishop\'s gift.\r\n\r\nNow there are peculiar circumstances connected with the precentorship\r\nwhich must be explained.  In the year 1434 there died at Barchester\r\none John Hiram, who had made money in the town as a wool-stapler, and\r\nin his will he left the house in which he died and certain meadows and\r\ncloses near the town, still called Hiram\'s Butts, and Hiram\'s Patch,\r\nfor the support of twelve superannuated wool-carders, all of whom\r\nshould have been born and bred and spent their days in Barchester; he\r\nalso appointed that an alms-house should be built for their abode,\r\nwith a fitting residence for a warden, which warden was also to\r\nreceive a certain sum annually out of the rents of the said butts and\r\npatches.  He, moreover, willed, having had a soul alive to harmony,\r\nthat the precentor of the cathedral should have the option of being\r\nalso warden of the almshouses, if the bishop in each case approved.\r\n\r\nFrom that day to this the charity had gone on and prospered--at least,\r\nthe charity had gone on, and the estates had prospered.  Wool-carding\r\nin Barchester there was no longer any; so the bishop, dean, and\r\nwarden, who took it in turn to put in the old men, generally\r\nappointed some hangers-on of their own; worn-out gardeners, decrepit\r\ngrave-diggers, or octogenarian sextons, who thankfully received a\r\ncomfortable lodging and one shilling and fourpence a day, such being\r\nthe stipend to which, under the will of John Hiram, they were declared\r\nto be entitled.  Formerly, indeed,--that is, till within some fifty\r\nyears of the present time,--they received but sixpence a day, and\r\ntheir breakfast and dinner was found them at a common table by the\r\nwarden, such an arrangement being in stricter conformity with the\r\nabsolute wording of old Hiram\'s will: but this was thought to be\r\ninconvenient, and to suit the tastes of neither warden nor bedesmen,\r\nand the daily one shilling and fourpence was substituted with the\r\ncommon consent of all parties, including the bishop and the\r\ncorporation of Barchester.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of Hiram\'s twelve old men when Mr Harding was\r\nappointed warden; but if they may be considered as well-to-do in the\r\nworld according to their condition, the happy warden was much more so.\r\nThe patches and butts which, in John Hiram\'s time, produced hay or fed\r\ncows, were now covered with rows of houses; the value of the property\r\nhad gradually increased from year to year and century to century, and\r\nwas now presumed by those who knew anything about it, to bring in\r\na very nice income; and by some who knew nothing about it, to have\r\nincreased to an almost fabulous extent.\r\n\r\nThe property was farmed by a gentleman in Barchester, who also acted\r\nas the bishop\'s steward,--a man whose father and grandfather had been\r\nstewards to the bishops of Barchester, and farmers of John Hiram\'s\r\nestate.  The Chadwicks had earned a good name in Barchester; they\r\nhad lived respected by bishops, deans, canons, and precentors; they\r\nhad been buried in the precincts of the cathedral; they had never\r\nbeen known as griping, hard men, but had always lived comfortably,\r\nmaintained a good house, and held a high position in Barchester\r\nsociety.  The present Mr Chadwick was a worthy scion of a worthy\r\nstock, and the tenants living on the butts and patches, as well as\r\nthose on the wide episcopal domains of the see, were well pleased to\r\nhave to do with so worthy and liberal a steward.\r\n\r\nFor many, many years,--records hardly tell how many, probably from\r\nthe time when Hiram\'s wishes had been first fully carried out,--the\r\nproceeds of the estate had been paid by the steward or farmer to the\r\nwarden, and by him divided among the bedesmen; after which division\r\nhe paid himself such sums as became his due.  Times had been when the\r\npoor warden got nothing but his bare house, for the patches had been\r\nsubject to floods, and the land of Barchester butts was said to be\r\nunproductive; and in these hard times the warden was hardly able to\r\nmake out the daily dole for his twelve dependents.  But by degrees\r\nthings mended; the patches were drained, and cottages began to\r\nrise upon the butts, and the wardens, with fairness enough, repaid\r\nthemselves for the evil days gone by.  In bad times the poor men had\r\nhad their due, and therefore in good times they could expect no more.\r\nIn this manner the income of the warden had increased; the picturesque\r\nhouse attached to the hospital had been enlarged and adorned, and\r\nthe office had become one of the most coveted of the snug clerical\r\nsinecures attached to our church.  It was now wholly in the bishop\'s\r\ngift, and though the dean and chapter, in former days, made a stand\r\non the subject, they had thought it more conducive to their honour\r\nto have a rich precentor appointed by the bishop, than a poor one\r\nappointed by themselves.  The stipend of the precentor of Barchester\r\nwas eighty pounds a year.  The income arising from the wardenship of\r\nthe hospital was eight hundred, besides the value of the house.\r\n\r\nMurmurs, very slight murmurs, had been heard in Barchester,--few\r\nindeed, and far between,--that the proceeds of John Hiram\'s property\r\nhad not been fairly divided: but they can hardly be said to have been\r\nof such a nature as to have caused uneasiness to anyone: still the\r\nthing had been whispered, and Mr Harding had heard it.  Such was his\r\ncharacter in Barchester, so universal was his popularity, that the\r\nvery fact of his appointment would have quieted louder whispers\r\nthan those which had been heard; but Mr Harding was an open-handed,\r\njust-minded man, and feeling that there might be truth in what had\r\nbeen said, he had, on his instalment, declared his intention of adding\r\ntwopence a day to each man\'s pittance, making a sum of sixty-two\r\npounds eleven shillings and fourpence, which he was to pay out of\r\nhis own pocket.  In doing so, however, he distinctly and repeatedly\r\nobserved to the men, that though he promised for himself, he could not\r\npromise for his successors, and that the extra twopence could only\r\nbe looked on as a gift from himself, and not from the trust.  The\r\nbedesmen, however, were most of them older than Mr Harding, and were\r\nquite satisfied with the security on which their extra income was\r\nbased.\r\n\r\nThis munificence on the part of Mr Harding had not been unopposed.\r\nMr Chadwick had mildly but seriously dissuaded him from it; and his\r\nstrong-minded son-in-law, the archdeacon, the man of whom alone Mr\r\nHarding stood in awe, had urgently, nay, vehemently, opposed so\r\nimpolitic a concession: but the warden had made known his intention\r\nto the hospital before the archdeacon had been able to interfere,\r\nand the deed was done.\r\n\r\nHiram\'s Hospital, as the retreat is called, is a picturesque building\r\nenough, and shows the correct taste with which the ecclesiastical\r\narchitects of those days were imbued.  It stands on the banks of the\r\nlittle river, which flows nearly round the cathedral close, being on\r\nthe side furthest from the town.  The London road crosses the river\r\nby a pretty one-arched bridge, and, looking from this bridge, the\r\nstranger will see the windows of the old men\'s rooms, each pair of\r\nwindows separated by a small buttress.  A broad gravel walk runs\r\nbetween the building and the river, which is always trim and cared\r\nfor; and at the end of the walk, under the parapet of the approach to\r\nthe bridge, is a large and well-worn seat, on which, in mild weather,\r\nthree or four of Hiram\'s bedesmen are sure to be seen seated.  Beyond\r\nthis row of buttresses, and further from the bridge, and also further\r\nfrom the water which here suddenly bends, are the pretty oriel windows\r\nof Mr Harding\'s house, and his well-mown lawn.  The entrance to the\r\nhospital is from the London road, and is made through a ponderous\r\ngateway under a heavy stone arch, unnecessary, one would suppose, at\r\nany time, for the protection of twelve old men, but greatly conducive\r\nto the good appearance of Hiram\'s charity.  On passing through this\r\nportal, never closed to anyone from 6 A.M. till 10 P.M., and never\r\nopen afterwards, except on application to a huge, intricately hung\r\nmedi\xe6val bell, the handle of which no uninitiated intruder can\r\npossibly find, the six doors of the old men\'s abodes are seen, and\r\nbeyond them is a slight iron screen, through which the more happy\r\nportion of the Barchester elite pass into the Elysium of Mr Harding\'s\r\ndwelling.\r\n\r\nMr Harding is a small man, now verging on sixty years, but bearing few\r\nof the signs of age; his hair is rather grizzled, though not gray;\r\nhis eye is very mild, but clear and bright, though the double glasses\r\nwhich are held swinging from his hand, unless when fixed upon his\r\nnose, show that time has told upon his sight; his hands are delicately\r\nwhite, and both hands and feet are small; he always wears a black\r\nfrock coat, black knee-breeches, and black gaiters, and somewhat\r\nscandalises some of his more hyperclerical brethren by a black\r\nneck-handkerchief.\r\n\r\nMr Harding\'s warmest admirers cannot say that he was ever an\r\nindustrious man; the circumstances of his life have not called on\r\nhim to be so; and yet he can hardly be called an idler.  Since his\r\nappointment to his precentorship, he has published, with all possible\r\nadditions of vellum, typography, and gilding, a collection of our\r\nancient church music, with some correct dissertations on Purcell,\r\nCrotch, and Nares.  He has greatly improved the choir of Barchester,\r\nwhich, under his dominion, now rivals that of any cathedral in\r\nEngland.  He has taken something more than his fair share in the\r\ncathedral services, and has played the violoncello daily to such\r\naudiences as he could collect, or, _faute de mieux_, to no audience\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nWe must mention one other peculiarity of Mr Harding.  As we have\r\nbefore stated, he has an income of eight hundred a year, and has no\r\nfamily but his one daughter; and yet he is never quite at ease in\r\nmoney matters.  The vellum and gilding of "Harding\'s Church Music"\r\ncost more than any one knows, except the author, the publisher, and\r\nthe Rev. Theophilus Grantly, who allows none of his father-in-law\'s\r\nextravagances to escape him.  Then he is generous to his daughter, for\r\nwhose service he keeps a small carriage and pair of ponies.  He is,\r\nindeed, generous to all, but especially to the twelve old men who are\r\nin a peculiar manner under his care.  No doubt with such an income Mr\r\nHarding should be above the world, as the saying is; but, at any rate,\r\nhe is not above Archdeacon Theophilus Grantly, for he is always more\r\nor less in debt to his son-in-law, who has, to a certain extent,\r\nassumed the arrangement of the precentor\'s pecuniary affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\n\r\nTHE BARCHESTER REFORMER\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Harding has been now precentor of Barchester for ten years; and,\r\nalas, the murmurs respecting the proceeds of Hiram\'s estate are again\r\nbecoming audible.  It is not that any one begrudges to Mr Harding\r\nthe income which he enjoys, and the comfortable place which so well\r\nbecomes him; but such matters have begun to be talked of in various\r\nparts of England.  Eager pushing politicians have asserted in the\r\nHouse of Commons, with very telling indignation, that the grasping\r\npriests of the Church of England are gorged with the wealth which the\r\ncharity of former times has left for the solace of the aged, or the\r\neducation of the young.  The well-known case of the Hospital of St\r\nCross has even come before the law courts of the country, and the\r\nstruggles of Mr Whiston, at Rochester, have met with sympathy and\r\nsupport.  Men are beginning to say that these things must be looked\r\ninto.\r\n\r\nMr Harding, whose conscience in the matter is clear, and who has never\r\nfelt that he had received a pound from Hiram\'s will to which he was\r\nnot entitled, has naturally taken the part of the church in talking\r\nover these matters with his friend, the bishop, and his son-in-law,\r\nthe archdeacon.  The archdeacon, indeed, Dr Grantly, has been somewhat\r\nloud in the matter.  He is a personal friend of the dignitaries of the\r\nRochester Chapter, and has written letters in the public press on the\r\nsubject of that turbulent Dr Whiston, which, his admirers think, must\r\nwell nigh set the question at rest.  It is also known at Oxford that\r\nhe is the author of the pamphlet signed "Sacerdos" on the subject of\r\nthe Earl of Guildford and St Cross, in which it is so clearly argued\r\nthat the manners of the present times do not admit of a literal\r\nadhesion to the very words of the founder\'s will, but that the\r\ninterests of the church for which the founder was so deeply concerned\r\nare best consulted in enabling its bishops to reward those shining\r\nlights whose services have been most signally serviceable to\r\nChristianity.  In answer to this, it is asserted that Henry de Blois,\r\nfounder of St Cross, was not greatly interested in the welfare of the\r\nreformed church, and that the masters of St Cross, for many years\r\npast, cannot be called shining lights in the service of Christianity;\r\nit is, however, stoutly maintained, and no doubt felt, by all the\r\narchdeacon\'s friends, that his logic is conclusive, and has not, in\r\nfact, been answered.\r\n\r\nWith such a tower of strength to back both his arguments and his\r\nconscience, it may be imagined that Mr Harding has never felt any\r\ncompunction as to receiving his quarterly sum of two hundred pounds.\r\nIndeed, the subject has never presented itself to his mind in that\r\nshape.  He has talked not unfrequently, and heard very much about the\r\nwills of old founders and the incomes arising from their estates,\r\nduring the last year or two; he did even, at one moment, feel a\r\ndoubt (since expelled by his son-in-law\'s logic) as to whether Lord\r\nGuildford was clearly entitled to receive so enormous an income\r\nas he does from the revenues of St Cross; but that he himself was\r\noverpaid with his modest eight hundred pounds,--he who, out of that,\r\nvoluntarily gave up sixty-two pounds eleven shillings and fourpence a\r\nyear to his twelve old neighbours,--he who, for the money, does his\r\nprecentor\'s work as no precentor has done it before, since Barchester\r\nCathedral was built,--such an idea has never sullied his quiet, or\r\ndisturbed his conscience.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Mr Harding is becoming uneasy at the rumour which he\r\nknows to prevail in Barchester on the subject.  He is aware that, at\r\nany rate, two of his old men have been heard to say, that if everyone\r\nhad his own, they might each have their hundred pounds a year, and\r\nlive like gentlemen, instead of a beggarly one shilling and sixpence\r\na day; and that they had slender cause to be thankful for a miserable\r\ndole of twopence, when Mr Harding and Mr Chadwick, between them, ran\r\naway with thousands of pounds which good old John Hiram never intended\r\nfor the like of them.  It is the ingratitude of this which stings Mr\r\nHarding.  One of this discontented pair, Abel Handy, was put into the\r\nhospital by himself; he had been a stone-mason in Barchester, and had\r\nbroken his thigh by a fall from a scaffolding, while employed about\r\nthe cathedral; and Mr Harding had given him the first vacancy in the\r\nhospital after the occurrence, although Dr Grantly had been very\r\nanxious to put into it an insufferable clerk of his at Plumstead\r\nEpiscopi, who had lost all his teeth, and whom the archdeacon hardly\r\nknew how to get rid of by other means.  Dr Grantly has not forgotten\r\nto remind Mr Harding how well satisfied with his one-and-sixpence a\r\nday old Joe Mutters would have been, and how injudicious it was on the\r\npart of Mr Harding to allow a radical from the town to get into the\r\nconcern. Probably Dr Grantly forgot, at the moment, that the charity\r\nwas intended for broken-down journeymen of Barchester.\r\n\r\nThere is living at Barchester, a young man, a surgeon, named John\r\nBold, and both Mr Harding and Dr Grantly are well aware that to him\r\nis owing the pestilent rebellious feeling which has shown itself in\r\nthe hospital; yes, and the renewal, too, of that disagreeable talk\r\nabout Hiram\'s estates which is now again prevalent in Barchester.\r\nNevertheless, Mr Harding and Mr Bold are acquainted with each other;\r\nwe may say, are friends, considering the great disparity in their\r\nyears.  Dr Grantly, however, has a holy horror of the impious\r\ndemagogue, as on one occasion he called Bold, when speaking of him\r\nto the precentor; and being a more prudent far-seeing man than Mr\r\nHarding, and possessed of a stronger head, he already perceives that\r\nthis John Bold will work great trouble in Barchester.  He considers\r\nthat he is to be regarded as an enemy, and thinks that he should not\r\nbe admitted into the camp on anything like friendly terms.  As John\r\nBold will occupy much of our attention, we must endeavour to explain\r\nwho he is, and why he takes the part of John Hiram\'s bedesmen.\r\n\r\nJohn Bold is a young surgeon, who passed many of his boyish years at\r\nBarchester.  His father was a physician in the city of London, where\r\nhe made a moderate fortune, which he invested in houses in that city.\r\nThe Dragon of Wantly inn and posting-house belonged to him, also four\r\nshops in the High Street, and a moiety of the new row of genteel\r\nvillas (so called in the advertisements), built outside the town just\r\nbeyond Hiram\'s Hospital.  To one of these Dr Bold retired to spend\r\nthe evening of his life, and to die; and here his son John spent his\r\nholidays, and afterwards his Christmas vacation when he went from\r\nschool to study surgery in the London hospitals.  Just as John Bold\r\nwas entitled to write himself surgeon and apothecary, old Dr Bold\r\ndied, leaving his Barchester property to his son, and a certain sum in\r\nthe three per cents. to his daughter Mary, who is some four or five\r\nyears older than her brother.\r\n\r\nJohn Bold determined to settle himself at Barchester, and look after\r\nhis own property, as well as the bones and bodies of such of his\r\nneighbours as would call upon him for assistance in their troubles.\r\nHe therefore put up a large brass plate with "John Bold, Surgeon" on\r\nit, to the great disgust of the nine practitioners who were already\r\ntrying to get a living out of the bishop, dean, and canons; and began\r\nhouse-keeping with the aid of his sister.  At this time he was not\r\nmore than twenty-four years old; and though he has now been three\r\nyears in Barchester, we have not heard that he has done much harm to\r\nthe nine worthy practitioners.  Indeed, their dread of him has died\r\naway; for in three years he has not taken three fees.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, John Bold is a clever man, and would, with practice,\r\nbe a clever surgeon; but he has got quite into another line of life.\r\nHaving enough to live on, he has not been forced to work for bread;\r\nhe has declined to subject himself to what he calls the drudgery of\r\nthe profession, by which, I believe, he means the general work of a\r\npractising surgeon; and has found other employment.  He frequently\r\nbinds up the bruises and sets the limbs of such of the poorer classes\r\nas profess his way of thinking,--but this he does for love.  Now I\r\nwill not say that the archdeacon is strictly correct in stigmatising\r\nJohn Bold as a demagogue, for I hardly know how extreme must be a\r\nman\'s opinions before he can be justly so called; but Bold is a strong\r\nreformer.  His passion is the reform of all abuses; state abuses,\r\nchurch abuses, corporation abuses (he has got himself elected a town\r\ncouncillor of Barchester, and has so worried three consecutive mayors,\r\nthat it became somewhat difficult to find a fourth), abuses in\r\nmedical practice, and general abuses in the world at large.  Bold is\r\nthoroughly sincere in his patriotic endeavours to mend mankind, and\r\nthere is something to be admired in the energy with which he devotes\r\nhimself to remedying evil and stopping injustice; but I fear that\r\nhe is too much imbued with the idea that he has a special mission\r\nfor reforming.  It would be well if one so young had a little\r\nmore diffidence himself, and more trust in the honest purposes of\r\nothers,--if he could be brought to believe that old customs need not\r\nnecessarily be evil, and that changes may possibly be dangerous; but\r\nno, Bold has all the ardour and all the self-assurance of a Danton,\r\nand hurls his anathemas against time-honoured practices with the\r\nviolence of a French Jacobin.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that Dr Grantly should regard Bold as a firebrand, falling,\r\nas he has done, almost in the centre of the quiet ancient close of\r\nBarchester Cathedral.  Dr Grantly would have him avoided as the\r\nplague; but the old Doctor and Mr Harding were fast friends.  Young\r\nJohnny Bold used to play as a boy on Mr Harding\'s lawn; he has many a\r\ntime won the precentor\'s heart by listening with rapt attention to his\r\nsacred strains; and since those days, to tell the truth at once, he\r\nhas nearly won another heart within the same walls.\r\n\r\nEleanor Harding has not plighted her troth to John Bold, nor has she,\r\nperhaps, owned to herself how dear to her the young reformer is; but\r\nshe cannot endure that anyone should speak harshly of him.  She does\r\nnot dare to defend him when her brother-in-law is so loud against him;\r\nfor she, like her father, is somewhat afraid of Dr Grantly; but she is\r\nbeginning greatly to dislike the archdeacon.  She persuades her father\r\nthat it would be both unjust and injudicious to banish his young\r\nfriend because of his politics; she cares little to go to houses where\r\nshe will not meet him, and, in fact, she is in love.\r\n\r\nNor is there any good reason why Eleanor Harding should not love John\r\nBold.  He has all those qualities which are likely to touch a girl\'s\r\nheart.  He is brave, eager, and amusing; well-made and good-looking;\r\nyoung and enterprising; his character is in all respects good; he has\r\nsufficient income to support a wife; he is her father\'s friend; and,\r\nabove all, he is in love with her: then why should not Eleanor Harding\r\nbe attached to John Bold?\r\n\r\nDr Grantly, who has as many eyes as Argus, and has long seen how the\r\nwind blows in that direction, thinks there are various strong reasons\r\nwhy this should not be so.  He has not thought it wise as yet to\r\nspeak to his father-in-law on the subject, for he knows how foolishly\r\nindulgent is Mr Harding in everything that concerns his daughter; but\r\nhe has discussed the matter with his all-trusted helpmate, within\r\nthat sacred recess formed by the clerical bed-curtains at Plumstead\r\nEpiscopi.\r\n\r\nHow much sweet solace, how much valued counsel has our archdeacon\r\nreceived within that sainted enclosure!  \'Tis there alone that he\r\nunbends, and comes down from his high church pedestal to the level of\r\na mortal man.  In the world Dr Grantly never lays aside that demeanour\r\nwhich so well becomes him.  He has all the dignity of an ancient saint\r\nwith the sleekness of a modern bishop; he is always the same; he is\r\nalways the archdeacon; unlike Homer, he never nods.  Even with his\r\nfather-in-law, even with the bishop and dean, he maintains that\r\nsonorous tone and lofty deportment which strikes awe into the\r\nyoung hearts of Barchester, and absolutely cows the whole parish of\r\nPlumstead Episcopi.  \'Tis only when he has exchanged that ever-new\r\nshovel hat for a tasselled nightcap, and those shining black\r\nhabiliments for his accustomed _robe de nuit_, that Dr Grantly talks,\r\nand looks, and thinks like an ordinary man.\r\n\r\nMany of us have often thought how severe a trial of faith must this\r\nbe to the wives of our great church dignitaries.  To us these men are\r\npersonifications of St Paul; their very gait is a speaking sermon;\r\ntheir clean and sombre apparel exacts from us faith and submission,\r\nand the cardinal virtues seem to hover round their sacred hats.\r\nA dean or archbishop, in the garb of his order, is sure of our\r\nreverence, and a well-got-up bishop fills our very souls with awe.\r\nBut how can this feeling be perpetuated in the bosoms of those who see\r\nthe bishops without their aprons, and the archdeacons even in a lower\r\nstate of dishabille?\r\n\r\nDo we not all know some reverend, all but sacred, personage before\r\nwhom our tongue ceases to be loud and our step to be elastic?  But\r\nwere we once to see him stretch himself beneath the bed-clothes, yawn\r\nwidely, and bury his face upon his pillow, we could chatter before\r\nhim as glibly as before a doctor or a lawyer.  From some such cause,\r\ndoubtless, it arose that our archdeacon listened to the counsels of\r\nhis wife, though he considered himself entitled to give counsel to\r\nevery other being whom he met.\r\n\r\n"My dear," he said, as he adjusted the copious folds of his nightcap,\r\n"there was that John Bold at your father\'s again to-day.  I must say\r\nyour father is very imprudent."\r\n\r\n"He is imprudent;--he always was," replied Mrs Grantly, speaking from\r\nunder the comfortable bed-clothes.  "There\'s nothing new in that."\r\n\r\n"No, my dear, there\'s nothing new;--I know that; but, at the present\r\njuncture of affairs, such imprudence is--is--I\'ll tell you what, my\r\ndear, if he does not take care what he\'s about, John Bold will be off\r\nwith Eleanor."\r\n\r\n"I think he will, whether papa takes care or no; and why not?"\r\n\r\n"Why not!" almost screamed the archdeacon, giving so rough a pull at\r\nhis nightcap as almost to bring it over his nose; "why not!--that\r\npestilent, interfering upstart, John Bold;--the most vulgar young\r\nperson I ever met!  Do you know that he is meddling with your father\'s\r\naffairs in a most uncalled-for--most--"  And being at a loss for an\r\nepithet sufficiently injurious, he finished his expressions of horror\r\nby muttering, "Good heavens!" in a manner that had been found very\r\nefficacious in clerical meetings of the diocese.  He must for the\r\nmoment have forgotten where he was.\r\n\r\n"As to his vulgarity, archdeacon" (Mrs Grantly had never assumed a\r\nmore familiar term than this in addressing her husband), "I don\'t\r\nagree with you.  Not that I like Mr Bold;--he is a great deal too\r\nconceited for me; but then Eleanor does, and it would be the best\r\nthing in the world for papa if they were to marry.  Bold would never\r\ntrouble himself about Hiram\'s Hospital if he were papa\'s son-in-law."\r\nAnd the lady turned herself round under the bed-clothes, in a manner\r\nto which the doctor was well accustomed, and which told him, as\r\nplainly as words, that as far as she was concerned the subject was\r\nover for that night.\r\n\r\n"Good heavens!" murmured the doctor again;--he was evidently much put\r\nbeside himself.\r\n\r\nDr Grantly is by no means a bad man; he is exactly the man which such\r\nan education as his was most likely to form; his intellect being\r\nsufficient for such a place in the world, but not sufficient to put\r\nhim in advance of it.  He performs with a rigid constancy such of the\r\nduties of a parish clergyman as are, to his thinking, above the sphere\r\nof his curate, but it is as an archdeacon that he shines.\r\n\r\nWe believe, as a general rule, that either a bishop or his archdeacons\r\nhave sinecures: where a bishop works, archdeacons have but little to\r\ndo, and _vice versa_.  In the diocese of Barchester the Archdeacon\r\nof Barchester does the work.  In that capacity he is diligent,\r\nauthoritative, and, as his friends particularly boast, judicious.  His\r\ngreat fault is an overbearing assurance of the virtues and claims of\r\nhis order, and his great foible is an equally strong confidence in the\r\ndignity of his own manner and the eloquence of his own words.  He is a\r\nmoral man, believing the precepts which he teaches, and believing also\r\nthat he acts up to them; though we cannot say that he would give his\r\ncoat to the man who took his cloak, or that he is prepared to forgive\r\nhis brother even seven times.  He is severe enough in exacting his\r\ndues, considering that any laxity in this respect would endanger the\r\nsecurity of the church; and, could he have his way, he would consign\r\nto darkness and perdition, not only every individual reformer, but\r\nevery committee and every commission that would even dare to ask a\r\nquestion respecting the appropriation of church revenues.\r\n\r\n"They are church revenues: the laity admit it.  Surely the church is\r\nable to administer her own revenues."  \'Twas thus he was accustomed to\r\nargue, when the sacrilegious doings of Lord John Russell and others\r\nwere discussed either at Barchester or at Oxford.\r\n\r\nIt was no wonder that Dr Grantly did not like John Bold, and that his\r\nwife\'s suggestion that he should become closely connected with such a\r\nman dismayed him.  To give him his due, the archdeacon never wanted\r\ncourage; he was quite willing to meet his enemy on any field and with\r\nany weapon.  He had that belief in his own arguments that he felt sure\r\nof success, could he only be sure of a fair fight on the part of his\r\nadversary.  He had no idea that John Bold could really prove that the\r\nincome of the hospital was malappropriated; why, then, should peace be\r\nsought for on such base terms?  What! bribe an unbelieving enemy of\r\nthe church with the sister-in-law of one dignitary and the daughter\r\nof another--with a young lady whose connections with the diocese and\r\nchapter of Barchester were so close as to give her an undeniable claim\r\nto a husband endowed with some of its sacred wealth!  When Dr Grantly\r\ntalks of unbelieving enemies, he does not mean to imply want of belief\r\nin the doctrines of the church, but an equally dangerous scepticism as\r\nto its purity in money matters.\r\n\r\nMrs Grantly is not usually deaf to the claims of the high order to\r\nwhich she belongs.  She and her husband rarely disagree as to the tone\r\nwith which the church should be defended; how singular, then, that in\r\nsuch a case as this she should be willing to succumb!  The archdeacon\r\nagain murmurs "Good heavens!" as he lays himself beside her, but he\r\ndoes so in a voice audible only to himself, and he repeats it till\r\nsleep relieves him from deep thought.\r\n\r\nMr Harding himself has seen no reason why his daughter should not love\r\nJohn Bold.  He has not been unobservant of her feelings, and perhaps\r\nhis deepest regret at the part which he fears Bold is about to take\r\nregarding the hospital arises from the dread that he may be separated\r\nfrom his daughter, or that she may be separated from the man she\r\nloves.  He has never spoken to Eleanor about her lover; he is the\r\nlast man in the world to allude to such a subject unconsulted, even\r\nwith his own daughter; and had he considered that he had ground to\r\ndisapprove of Bold, he would have removed her, or forbidden him his\r\nhouse; but he saw no such ground.  He would probably have preferred a\r\nsecond clerical son-in-law, for Mr Harding, also, is attached to his\r\norder; and, failing in that, he would at any rate have wished that\r\nso near a connection should have thought alike with him on church\r\nmatters.  He would not, however, reject the man his daughter loved\r\nbecause he differed on such subjects with himself.\r\n\r\nHitherto Bold had taken no steps in the matter in any way annoying\r\nto Mr Harding personally.  Some months since, after a severe battle,\r\nwhich cost him not a little money, he gained a victory over a certain\r\nold turnpike woman in the neighbourhood, of whose charges another old\r\nwoman had complained to him.  He got the Act of Parliament relating\r\nto the trust, found that his _prot\xe9g\xe9e_ had been wrongly taxed,\r\nrode through the gate himself, paying the toll, then brought an\r\naction against the gate-keeper, and proved that all people coming\r\nup a certain by-lane, and going down a certain other by-lane, were\r\ntoll-free.  The fame of his success spread widely abroad, and he\r\nbegan to be looked on as the upholder of the rights of the poor of\r\nBarchester.  Not long after this success, he heard from different\r\nquarters that Hiram\'s bedesmen were treated as paupers, whereas the\r\nproperty to which they were, in effect, heirs was very large; and he\r\nwas instigated by the lawyer whom he had employed in the case of the\r\nturnpike to call upon Mr Chadwick for a statement as to the funds of\r\nthe estate.\r\n\r\nBold had often expressed his indignation at the malappropriation of\r\nchurch funds in general, in the hearing of his friend the precentor;\r\nbut the conversation had never referred to anything at Barchester; and\r\nwhen Finney, the attorney, induced him to interfere with the affairs\r\nof the hospital, it was against Mr Chadwick that his efforts were to\r\nbe directed.  Bold soon found that if he interfered with Mr Chadwick\r\nas steward, he must also interfere with Mr Harding as warden; and\r\nthough he regretted the situation in which this would place him, he\r\nwas not the man to flinch from his undertaking from personal motives.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had determined to take the matter in hand, he set\r\nabout his work with his usual energy.  He got a copy of John Hiram\'s\r\nwill, of the wording of which he made himself perfectly master.  He\r\nascertained the extent of the property, and as nearly as he could the\r\nvalue of it; and made out a schedule of what he was informed was the\r\npresent distribution of its income.  Armed with these particulars,\r\nhe called on Mr Chadwick, having given that gentleman notice of his\r\nvisit; and asked him for a statement of the income and expenditure of\r\nthe hospital for the last twenty-five years.\r\n\r\nThis was of course refused, Mr Chadwick alleging that he had no\r\nauthority for making public the concerns of a property in managing\r\nwhich he was only a paid servant.\r\n\r\n"And who is competent to give you that authority, Mr Chadwick?" asked\r\nBold.\r\n\r\n"Only those who employ me, Mr Bold," said the steward.\r\n\r\n"And who are those, Mr Chadwick?" demanded Bold.\r\n\r\nMr Chadwick begged to say that if these inquiries were made merely\r\nout of curiosity, he must decline answering them: if Mr Bold had any\r\nulterior proceeding in view, perhaps it would be desirable that any\r\nnecessary information should be sought for in a professional way by\r\na professional man.  Mr Chadwick\'s attorneys were Messrs Cox and\r\nCummins, of Lincoln\'s Inn.  Mr Bold took down the address of Cox and\r\nCummins, remarked that the weather was cold for the time of the year,\r\nand wished Mr Chadwick good-morning.  Mr Chadwick said it was cold\r\nfor June, and bowed him out.\r\n\r\nHe at once went to his lawyer, Finney.  Now, Bold was not very fond\r\nof his attorney, but, as he said, he merely wanted a man who knew the\r\nforms of law, and who would do what he was told for his money.  He\r\nhad no idea of putting himself in the hands of a lawyer.  He wanted\r\nlaw from a lawyer as he did a coat from a tailor, because he could\r\nnot make it so well himself; and he thought Finney the fittest man\r\nin Barchester for his purpose.  In one respect, at any rate, he was\r\nright: Finney was humility itself.\r\n\r\nFinney advised an instant letter to Cox and Cummins, mindful of\r\nhis six-and-eightpence.  "Slap at them at once, Mr Bold.  Demand\r\ncategorically and explicitly a full statement of the affairs of the\r\nhospital."\r\n\r\n"Suppose I were to see Mr Harding first," suggested Bold.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, by all means," said the acquiescing Finney; "though,\r\nperhaps, as Mr Harding is no man of business, it may lead--lead\r\nto some little difficulties; but perhaps you\'re right.  Mr Bold, I\r\ndon\'t think seeing Mr Harding can do any harm."  Finney saw from the\r\nexpression of his client\'s face that he intended to have his own way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\n\r\nTHE BISHOP OF BARCHESTER\r\n\r\n\r\nBold at once repaired to the hospital.  The day was now far advanced,\r\nbut he knew that Mr Harding dined in the summer at four, that Eleanor\r\nwas accustomed to drive in the evening, and that he might therefore\r\nprobably find Mr Harding alone.  It was between seven and eight when\r\nhe reached the slight iron gate leading into the precentor\'s garden,\r\nand though, as Mr Chadwick observed, the day had been cold for June,\r\nthe evening was mild, and soft, and sweet.  The little gate was open.\r\nAs he raised the latch he heard the notes of Mr Harding\'s violoncello\r\nfrom the far end of the garden, and, advancing before the house\r\nand across the lawn, he found him playing;--and not without an\r\naudience. The musician was seated in a garden-chair just within the\r\nsummer-house, so as to allow the violoncello which he held between his\r\nknees to rest upon the dry stone flooring; before him stood a rough\r\nmusic desk, on which was open a page of that dear sacred book, that\r\nmuch-laboured and much-loved volume of church music, which had cost so\r\nmany guineas; and around sat, and lay, and stood, and leaned, ten of\r\nthe twelve old men who dwelt with him beneath old John Hiram\'s roof.\r\nThe two reformers were not there.  I will not say that in their hearts\r\nthey were conscious of any wrong done or to be done to their mild\r\nwarden, but latterly they had kept aloof from him, and his music was\r\nno longer to their taste.\r\n\r\nIt was amusing to see the positions, and eager listening faces of\r\nthese well-to-do old men.  I will not say that they all appreciated\r\nthe music which they heard, but they were intent on appearing to\r\ndo so; pleased at being where they were, they were determined, as\r\nfar as in them lay, to give pleasure in return; and they were not\r\nunsuccessful.  It gladdened the precentor\'s heart to think that the\r\nold bedesmen whom he loved so well admired the strains which were to\r\nhim so full of almost ecstatic joy; and he used to boast that such was\r\nthe air of the hospital, as to make it a precinct specially fit for\r\nthe worship of St Cecilia.\r\n\r\nImmediately before him, on the extreme corner of the bench which\r\nran round the summer-house, sat one old man, with his handkerchief\r\nsmoothly lain upon his knees, who did enjoy the moment, or acted\r\nenjoyment well.  He was one on whose large frame many years, for he\r\nwas over eighty, had made small havoc;--he was still an upright,\r\nburly, handsome figure, with an open, ponderous brow, round which\r\nclung a few, though very few, thin gray locks.  The coarse black gown\r\nof the hospital, the breeches, and buckled shoes became him well; and\r\nas he sat with his hands folded on his staff, and his chin resting on\r\nhis hands, he was such a listener as most musicians would be glad to\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\nThis man was certainly the pride of the hospital.  It had always been\r\nthe custom that one should be selected as being to some extent in\r\nauthority over the others; and though Mr Bunce, for such was his name,\r\nand so he was always designated by his inferior brethren, had no\r\ngreater emoluments than they, he had assumed, and well knew how to\r\nmaintain, the dignity of his elevation.  The precentor delighted to\r\ncall him his sub-warden, and was not ashamed, occasionally, when no\r\nother guest was there, to bid him sit down by the same parlour fire,\r\nand drink the full glass of port which was placed near him.  Bunce\r\nnever went without the second glass, but no entreaty ever made him\r\ntake a third.\r\n\r\n"Well, well, Mr Harding; you\'re too good, much too good," he\'d always\r\nsay, as the second glass was filled; but when that was drunk, and the\r\nhalf hour over, Bunce stood erect, and with a benediction which his\r\npatron valued, retired to his own abode.  He knew the world too well\r\nto risk the comfort of such halcyon moments, by prolonging them till\r\nthey were disagreeable.\r\n\r\nMr Bunce, as may be imagined, was most strongly opposed to innovation.\r\nNot even Dr Grantly had a more holy horror of those who would\r\ninterfere in the affairs of the hospital; he was every inch a\r\nchurchman, and though he was not very fond of Dr Grantly personally,\r\nthat arose from there not being room in the hospital for two people\r\nso much alike as the doctor and himself, rather than from any\r\ndissimilarity in feeling.  Mr Bunce was inclined to think that\r\nthe warden and himself could manage the hospital without further\r\nassistance; and that, though the bishop was the constitutional\r\nvisitor, and as such entitled to special reverence from all connected\r\nwith John Hiram\'s will, John Hiram never intended that his affairs\r\nshould be interfered with by an archdeacon.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment, however, these cares were off his mind, and he\r\nwas looking at his warden, as though he thought the music heavenly,\r\nand the musician hardly less so.\r\n\r\nAs Bold walked silently over the lawn, Mr Harding did not at first\r\nperceive him, and continued to draw his bow slowly across the\r\nplaintive wires; but he soon found from his audience that some\r\nstranger was there, and looking up, began to welcome his young friend\r\nwith frank hospitality.\r\n\r\n"Pray, Mr Harding--pray don\'t let me disturb you," said Bold; "you\r\nknow how fond I am of sacred music."\r\n\r\n"Oh! it\'s nothing," said the precentor, shutting up the book and then\r\nopening it again as he saw the delightfully imploring look of his old\r\nfriend Bunce.  Oh, Bunce, Bunce, Bunce, I fear that after all thou art\r\nbut a flatterer.  "Well, I\'ll just finish it then; it\'s a favourite\r\nlittle bit of Bishop\'s; and then, Mr Bold, we\'ll have a stroll and\r\na chat till Eleanor comes in and gives us tea."  And so Bold sat\r\ndown on the soft turf to listen, or rather to think how, after such\r\nsweet harmony, he might best introduce a theme of so much discord, to\r\ndisturb the peace of him who was so ready to welcome him kindly.\r\n\r\nBold thought that the performance was soon over, for he felt that\r\nhe had a somewhat difficult task, and he almost regretted the final\r\nleave-taking of the last of the old men, slow as they were in going\r\nthrough their adieux.\r\n\r\nBold\'s heart was in his mouth, as the precentor made some ordinary but\r\nkind remark as to the friendliness of the visit.\r\n\r\n"One evening call," said he, "is worth ten in the morning.  It\'s all\r\nformality in the morning; real social talk never begins till after\r\ndinner.  That\'s why I dine early, so as to get as much as I can of\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Quite true, Mr Harding," said the other; "but I fear I\'ve reversed\r\nthe order of things, and I owe you much apology for troubling you on\r\nbusiness at such an hour; but it is on business that I have called\r\njust now."\r\n\r\nMr Harding looked blank and annoyed; there was something in the\r\ntone of the young man\'s voice which told him that the interview was\r\nintended to be disagreeable, and he shrank back at finding his kindly\r\ngreeting so repulsed.\r\n\r\n"I wish to speak to you about the hospital," continued Bold.\r\n\r\n"Well, well, anything I can tell you I shall be most happy--"\r\n\r\n"It\'s about the accounts."\r\n\r\n"Then, my dear fellow, I can tell you nothing, for I\'m as ignorant\r\nas a child.  All I know is, that they pay me \xa3800 a year.  Go to\r\nChadwick, he knows all about the accounts; and now tell me, will poor\r\nMary Jones ever get the use of her limb again?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I think she will, if she\'s careful; but, Mr Harding, I hope\r\nyou won\'t object to discuss with me what I have to say about the\r\nhospital."\r\n\r\nMr Harding gave a deep, long-drawn sigh.  He did object, very strongly\r\nobject, to discuss any such subject with John Bold; but he had not the\r\nbusiness tact of Mr Chadwick, and did not know how to relieve himself\r\nfrom the coming evil; he sighed sadly, but made no answer.\r\n\r\n"I have the greatest regard for you, Mr Harding," continued Bold; "the\r\ntruest respect, the most sincere--"\r\n\r\n"Thank ye, thank ye, Mr Bold," interjaculated the precentor somewhat\r\nimpatiently; "I\'m much obliged, but never mind that; I\'m as likely to\r\nbe in the wrong as another man,--quite as likely."\r\n\r\n"But, Mr Harding, I must express what I feel, lest you should think\r\nthere is personal enmity in what I\'m going to do."\r\n\r\n"Personal enmity!  Going to do!  Why, you\'re not going to cut my\r\nthroat, nor put me into the Ecclesiastical Court!"\r\n\r\nBold tried to laugh, but he couldn\'t.  He was quite in earnest, and\r\ndetermined in his course, and couldn\'t make a joke of it.  He walked\r\non awhile in silence before he recommenced his attack, during which\r\nMr Harding, who had still the bow in his hand, played rapidly on an\r\nimaginary violoncello.  "I fear there is reason to think that John\r\nHiram\'s will is not carried out to the letter, Mr Harding," said the\r\nyoung man at last; "and I have been asked to see into it."\r\n\r\n"Very well, I\'ve no objection on earth; and now we need not say\r\nanother word about it."\r\n\r\n"Only one word more, Mr Harding.  Chadwick has referred me to Cox and\r\nCummins, and I think it my duty to apply to them for some statement\r\nabout the hospital.  In what I do I may appear to be interfering with\r\nyou, and I hope you will forgive me for doing so."\r\n\r\n"Mr Bold," said the other, stopping, and speaking with some solemnity,\r\n"if you act justly, say nothing in this matter but the truth, and use\r\nno unfair weapons in carrying out your purposes, I shall have nothing\r\nto forgive.  I presume you think I am not entitled to the income\r\nI receive from the hospital, and that others are entitled to it.\r\nWhatever some may do, I shall never attribute to you base motives\r\nbecause you hold an opinion opposed to my own and adverse to my\r\ninterests: pray do what you consider to be your duty; I can give\r\nyou no assistance, neither will I offer you any obstacle.  Let me,\r\nhowever, suggest to you, that you can in no wise forward your views\r\nnor I mine, by any discussion between us.  Here comes Eleanor and the\r\nponies, and we\'ll go in to tea."\r\n\r\nBold, however, felt that he could not sit down at ease with Mr Harding\r\nand his daughter after what had passed, and therefore excused himself\r\nwith much awkward apology; and merely raising his hat and bowing as he\r\npassed Eleanor and the pony chair, left her in disappointed amazement\r\nat his departure.\r\n\r\nMr Harding\'s demeanour certainly impressed Bold with a full conviction\r\nthat the warden felt that he stood on strong grounds, and almost made\r\nhim think that he was about to interfere without due warrant in the\r\nprivate affairs of a just and honourable man; but Mr Harding himself\r\nwas anything but satisfied with his own view of the case.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, he wished for Eleanor\'s sake to think well of\r\nBold and to like him, and yet he could not but feel disgusted at the\r\narrogance of his conduct.  What right had he to say that John Hiram\'s\r\nwill was not fairly carried out?  But then the question would arise\r\nwithin his heart,--Was that will fairly acted on?  Did John Hiram mean\r\nthat the warden of his hospital should receive considerably more out\r\nof the legacy than all the twelve old men together for whose behoof\r\nthe hospital was built?  Could it be possible that John Bold was\r\nright, and that the reverend warden of the hospital had been for the\r\nlast ten years and more the unjust recipient of an income legally and\r\nequitably belonging to others?  What if it should be proved before\r\nthe light of day that he, whose life had been so happy, so quiet,\r\nso respected, had absorbed eight thousand pounds to which he had no\r\ntitle, and which he could never repay?  I do not say that he feared\r\nthat such was really the case; but the first shade of doubt now fell\r\nacross his mind, and from this evening, for many a long, long day,\r\nour good, kind loving warden was neither happy nor at ease.\r\n\r\nThoughts of this kind, these first moments of much misery, oppressed\r\nMr Harding as he sat sipping his tea, absent and ill at ease.  Poor\r\nEleanor felt that all was not right, but her ideas as to the cause of\r\nthe evening\'s discomfort did not go beyond her lover, and his sudden\r\nand uncivil departure.  She thought there must have been some quarrel\r\nbetween Bold and her father, and she was half angry with both, though\r\nshe did not attempt to explain to herself why she was so.\r\n\r\nMr Harding thought long and deeply over these things, both before he\r\nwent to bed and after it, as he lay awake, questioning within himself\r\nthe validity of his claim to the income which he enjoyed.  It seemed\r\nclear at any rate that, however unfortunate he might be at having been\r\nplaced in such a position, no one could say that he ought either to\r\nhave refused the appointment first, or to have rejected the income\r\nafterwards.  All the world,--meaning the ecclesiastical world as\r\nconfined to the English church,--knew that the wardenship of the\r\nBarchester Hospital was a snug sinecure, but no one had ever been\r\nblamed for accepting it.  To how much blame, however, would he have\r\nbeen open had he rejected it!  How mad would he have been thought had\r\nhe declared, when the situation was vacant and offered to him, that he\r\nhad scruples as to receiving \xa3800 a year from John Hiram\'s property,\r\nand that he had rather some stranger should possess it!  How would Dr\r\nGrantly have shaken his wise head, and have consulted with his friends\r\nin the close as to some decent retreat for the coming insanity of the\r\npoor minor canon!  If he was right in accepting the place, it was\r\nclear to him also that he would be wrong in rejecting any part of the\r\nincome attached to it.  The patronage was a valuable appanage of the\r\nbishopric; and surely it would not be his duty to lessen the value\r\nof that preferment which had been bestowed on himself; surely he was\r\nbound to stand by his order.\r\n\r\nBut somehow these arguments, though they seemed logical, were not\r\nsatisfactory.  Was John Hiram\'s will fairly carried out? that was the\r\ntrue question: and if not, was it not his especial duty to see that\r\nthis was done,--his especial duty, whatever injury it might do to\r\nhis order,--however ill such duty might be received by his patron and\r\nhis friends?  At the idea of his friends, his mind turned unhappily\r\nto his son-in-law.  He knew well how strongly he would be supported\r\nby Dr Grantly, if he could bring himself to put his case into the\r\narchdeacon\'s hands and to allow him to fight the battle; but he knew\r\nalso that he would find no sympathy there for his doubts, no friendly\r\nfeeling, no inward comfort.  Dr Grantly would be ready enough to take\r\nup his cudgel against all comers on behalf of the church militant,\r\nbut he would do so on the distasteful ground of the church\'s\r\ninfallibility.  Such a contest would give no comfort to Mr Harding\'s\r\ndoubts.  He was not so anxious to prove himself right, as to be so.\r\n\r\nI have said before that Dr Grantly was the working man of the diocese,\r\nand that his father the bishop was somewhat inclined to an idle life.\r\nSo it was; but the bishop, though he had never been an active man, was\r\none whose qualities had rendered him dear to all who knew him.  He\r\nwas the very opposite to his son; he was a bland and a kind old man,\r\nopposed by every feeling to authoritative demonstrations and episcopal\r\nostentation.  It was perhaps well for him, in his situation, that his\r\nson had early in life been able to do that which he could not well do\r\nwhen he was younger, and which he could not have done at all now that\r\nhe was over seventy.  The bishop knew how to entertain the clergy\r\nof his diocese, to talk easy small-talk with the rectors\' wives,\r\nand put curates at their ease; but it required the strong hand of\r\nthe archdeacon to deal with such as were refractory either in their\r\ndoctrines or their lives.\r\n\r\nThe bishop and Mr Harding loved each other warmly.  They had grown old\r\ntogether, and had together spent many, many years in clerical pursuits\r\nand clerical conversation.  When one of them was a bishop and the\r\nother only a minor canon they were even then much together; but since\r\ntheir children had married, and Mr Harding had become warden and\r\nprecentor, they were all in all to each other.  I will not say that\r\nthey managed the diocese between them, but they spent much time in\r\ndiscussing the man who did, and in forming little plans to mitigate\r\nhis wrath against church delinquents, and soften his aspirations for\r\nchurch dominion.\r\n\r\nMr Harding determined to open his mind and confess his doubts to\r\nhis old friend; and to him he went on the morning after John Bold\'s\r\nuncourteous visit.\r\n\r\nUp to this period no rumour of these cruel proceedings against the\r\nhospital had reached the bishop\'s ears.  He had doubtless heard that\r\nmen existed who questioned his right to present to a sinecure of \xa3800\r\na year, as he had heard from time to time of some special immorality\r\nor disgraceful disturbance in the usually decent and quiet city of\r\nBarchester: but all he did, and all he was called on to do, on such\r\noccasions, was to shake his head, and to beg his son, the great\r\ndictator, to see that no harm happened to the church.\r\n\r\nIt was a long story that Mr Harding had to tell before he made the\r\nbishop comprehend his own view of the case; but we need not follow\r\nhim through the tale.  At first the bishop counselled but one step,\r\nrecommended but one remedy, had but one medicine in his whole\r\npharmacopoeia strong enough to touch so grave a disorder;--he\r\nprescribed the archdeacon.  "Refer him to the archdeacon," he\r\nrepeated, as Mr Harding spoke of Bold and his visit.  "The archdeacon\r\nwill set you quite right about that," he kindly said, when his friend\r\nspoke with hesitation of the justness of his cause.  "No man has got\r\nup all that so well as the archdeacon;" but the dose, though large,\r\nfailed to quiet the patient; indeed it almost produced nausea.\r\n\r\n"But, bishop," said he, "did you ever read John Hiram\'s will?"\r\n\r\nThe bishop thought probably he had, thirty-five years ago, when\r\nfirst instituted to his see, but could not state positively: however,\r\nhe very well knew that he had the absolute right to present to the\r\nwardenship, and that the income of the warden had been regularly\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\n"But, bishop, the question is, who has the power to settle it?\r\nIf, as this young man says, the will provides that the proceeds of\r\nthe property are to be divided into shares, who has the power to\r\nalter these provisions?"  The bishop had an indistinct idea that\r\nthey altered themselves by the lapse of years; that a kind of\r\necclesiastical statute of limitation barred the rights of the twelve\r\nbedesmen to any increase of income arising from the increased value of\r\nproperty.  He said something about tradition; more of the many learned\r\nmen who by their practice had confirmed the present arrangement;\r\nthen went at some length into the propriety of maintaining the due\r\ndifference in rank and income between a beneficed clergyman and\r\ncertain poor old men who were dependent on charity; and concluded his\r\nargument by another reference to the archdeacon.\r\n\r\nThe precentor sat thoughtfully gazing at the fire, and listening to\r\nthe good-natured reasoning of his friend.  What the bishop said had a\r\nsort of comfort in it, but it was not a sustaining comfort.  It made\r\nMr Harding feel that many others,--indeed, all others of his own\r\norder,--would think him right; but it failed to prove to him that he\r\ntruly was so.\r\n\r\n"Bishop," said he, at last, after both had sat silent for a while, "I\r\nshould deceive you and myself too, if I did not tell you that I am\r\nvery unhappy about this.  Suppose that I cannot bring myself to agree\r\nwith Dr Grantly!--that I find, after inquiry, that the young man is\r\nright, and that I am wrong,--what then?"\r\n\r\nThe two old men were sitting near each other,--so near that the bishop\r\nwas able to lay his hand upon the other\'s knee, and he did so with a\r\ngentle pressure.  Mr Harding well knew what that pressure meant.  The\r\nbishop had no further argument to adduce; he could not fight for the\r\ncause as his son would do; he could not prove all the precentor\'s\r\ndoubts to be groundless; but he could sympathise with his friend, and\r\nhe did so; and Mr Harding felt that he had received that for which he\r\ncame.  There was another period of silence, after which the bishop\r\nasked, with a degree of irritable energy, very unusual with him,\r\nwhether this "pestilent intruder" (meaning John Bold) had any friends\r\nin Barchester.\r\n\r\nMr Harding had fully made up his mind to tell the bishop everything;\r\nto speak of his daughter\'s love, as well as his own troubles; to talk\r\nof John Bold in his double capacity of future son-in-law and present\r\nenemy; and though he felt it to be sufficiently disagreeable, now was\r\nhis time to do it.\r\n\r\n"He is very intimate at my own house, bishop."  The bishop stared.  He\r\nwas not so far gone in orthodoxy and church militancy as his son, but\r\nstill he could not bring himself to understand how so declared an\r\nenemy of the establishment could be admitted on terms of intimacy into\r\nthe house, not only of so firm a pillar as Mr Harding, but one so much\r\ninjured as the warden of the hospital.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I like Mr Bold much, personally," continued the disinterested\r\nvictim; "and to tell you the \'truth,\'"--he hesitated as he brought out\r\nthe dreadful tidings,--"I have sometimes thought it not improbable\r\nthat he would be my second son-in-law."  The bishop did not whistle:\r\nwe believe that they lose the power of doing so on being consecrated;\r\nand that in these days one might as easily meet a corrupt judge as a\r\nwhistling bishop; but he looked as though he would have done so, but\r\nfor his apron.\r\n\r\nWhat a brother-in-law for the archdeacon! what an alliance for\r\nBarchester close! what a connection for even the episcopal palace!\r\nThe bishop, in his simple mind, felt no doubt that John Bold, had he\r\nso much power, would shut up all cathedrals, and probably all parish\r\nchurches; distribute all tithes among Methodists, Baptists, and other\r\nsavage tribes; utterly annihilate the sacred bench, and make shovel\r\nhats and lawn sleeves as illegal as cowls, sandals, and sackcloth!\r\nHere was a nice man to be initiated into the comfortable arcana of\r\necclesiastical snuggeries; one who doubted the integrity of parsons,\r\nand probably disbelieved the Trinity!\r\n\r\nMr Harding saw what an effect his communication had made, and almost\r\nrepented the openness of his disclosure; he, however, did what he\r\ncould to moderate the grief of his friend and patron.  "I do not say\r\nthat there is any engagement between them.  Had there been, Eleanor\r\nwould have told me; I know her well enough to be assured that she\r\nwould have done so; but I see that they are fond of each other; and\r\nas a man and a father, I have had no objection to urge against their\r\nintimacy."\r\n\r\n"But, Mr Harding," said the bishop, "how are you to oppose him, if he\r\nis your son-in-law?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean to oppose him; it is he who opposes me; if anything is\r\nto be done in defence, I suppose Chadwick will do it.  I suppose--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, the archdeacon will see to that: were the young man twice his\r\nbrother-in-law, the archdeacon will never be deterred from doing what\r\nhe feels to be right."\r\n\r\nMr Harding reminded the bishop that the archdeacon and the reformer\r\nwere not yet brothers, and very probably never would be; exacted from\r\nhim a promise that Eleanor\'s name should not be mentioned in any\r\ndiscussion between the father bishop and son archdeacon respecting the\r\nhospital; and then took his departure, leaving his poor old friend\r\nbewildered, amazed, and confounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\n\r\nHIRAM\'S BEDESMEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parties most interested in the movement which is about to set\r\nBarchester by the ears were not the foremost to discuss the merit\r\nof the question, as is often the case; but when the bishop, the\r\narchdeacon, the warden, the steward, and Messrs Cox and Cummins,\r\nwere all busy with the matter, each in his own way, it is not to be\r\nsupposed that Hiram\'s bedesmen themselves were altogether passive\r\nspectators.  Finney, the attorney, had been among them, asking sly\r\nquestions, and raising immoderate hopes, creating a party hostile\r\nto the warden, and establishing a corps in the enemy\'s camp, as he\r\nfiguratively calls it to himself.  Poor old men: whoever may be\r\nrighted or wronged by this inquiry, they at any rate will assuredly\r\nbe only injured: to them it can only be an unmixed evil.  How can\r\ntheir lot be improved? all their wants are supplied; every comfort is\r\nadministered; they have warm houses, good clothes, plentiful diet,\r\nand rest after a life of labour; and above all, that treasure so\r\ninestimable in declining years, a true and kind friend to listen to\r\ntheir sorrows, watch over their sickness, and administer comfort as\r\nregards this world, and the world to come!\r\n\r\nJohn Bold sometimes thinks of this, when he is talking loudly of the\r\nrights of the bedesmen, whom he has taken under his protection; but he\r\nquiets the suggestion within his breast with the high-sounding name\r\nof justice: "_Fiat justitia, ruat coelum_."  These old men should,\r\nby rights, have one hundred pounds a year instead of one shilling\r\nand sixpence a day, and the warden should have two hundred or three\r\nhundred pounds instead of eight hundred pounds.  What is unjust must\r\nbe wrong; what is wrong should be righted; and if he declined the\r\ntask, who else would do it?\r\n\r\n"Each one of you is clearly entitled to one hundred pounds a year by\r\ncommon law": such had been the important whisper made by Finney into\r\nthe ears of Abel Handy, and by him retailed to his eleven brethren.\r\n\r\nToo much must not be expected from the flesh and blood even of John\r\nHiram\'s bedesmen, and the positive promise of one hundred a year to\r\neach of the twelve old men had its way with most of them.  The great\r\nBunce was not to be wiled away, and was upheld in his orthodoxy by\r\ntwo adherents.  Abel Handy, who was the leader of the aspirants after\r\nwealth, had, alas, a stronger following.  No less than five of the\r\ntwelve soon believed that his views were just, making with their\r\nleader a moiety of the hospital.  The other three, volatile unstable\r\nminds, vacillated between the two chieftains, now led away by the hope\r\nof gold, now anxious to propitiate the powers that still existed.\r\n\r\nIt had been proposed to address a petition to the bishop as visitor,\r\npraying his lordship to see justice done to the legal recipients of\r\nJohn Hiram\'s Charity, and to send copies of this petition and of the\r\nreply it would elicit to all the leading London papers, and thereby\r\nto obtain notoriety for the subject.  This it was thought would pave\r\nthe way for ulterior legal proceedings.  It would have been a great\r\nthing to have had the signatures and marks of all the twelve injured\r\nlegatees; but this was impossible: Bunce would have cut his hand off\r\nsooner than have signed it.  It was then suggested by Finney that\r\nif even eleven could be induced to sanction the document, the one\r\nobstinate recusant might have been represented as unfit to judge on\r\nsuch a question,--in fact, as being _non compos mentis_,--and the\r\npetition would have been taken as representing the feeling of the men.\r\nBut this could not be done: Bunce\'s friends were as firm as himself,\r\nand as yet only six crosses adorned the document.  It was the more\r\nprovoking, as Bunce himself could write his name legibly, and one of\r\nthose three doubting souls had for years boasted of like power, and\r\npossessed, indeed, a Bible, in which he was proud to show his name\r\nwritten by himself some thirty years ago--"Job Skulpit;" but it was\r\nthought that Job Skulpit, having forgotten his scholarship, on that\r\naccount recoiled from the petition, and that the other doubters would\r\nfollow as he led them.  A petition signed by half the hospital would\r\nhave but a poor effect.\r\n\r\nIt was in Skulpit\'s room that the petition was now lying, waiting such\r\nadditional signatures as Abel Handy, by his eloquence, could obtain\r\nfor it.  The six marks it bore were duly attested, thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n         his            his             his\r\n     Abel X Handy, Gregy X Moody, Mathew X Spriggs,\r\n         mark           mark            mark\r\n\r\n\r\n&c., and places were duly designated in pencil for those brethren who\r\nwere now expected to join: for Skulpit alone was left a spot on which\r\nhis genuine signature might be written in fair clerk-like style.\r\nHandy had brought in the document, and spread it out on the small deal\r\ntable, and was now standing by it persuasive and eager.  Moody had\r\nfollowed with an inkhorn, carefully left behind by Finney; and Spriggs\r\nbore aloft, as though it were a sword, a well-worn ink-black pen,\r\nwhich from time to time he endeavoured to thrust into Skulpit\'s\r\nunwilling hand.\r\n\r\nWith the learned man were his two abettors in indecision, William Gazy\r\nand Jonathan Crumple.  If ever the petition were to be forwarded, now\r\nwas the time,--so said Mr Finney; and great was the anxiety on the\r\npart of those whose one hundred pounds a year, as they believed,\r\nmainly depended on the document in question.\r\n\r\n"To be kept out of all that money," as the avaricious Moody had\r\nmuttered to his friend Handy, "by an old fool saying that he can\r\nwrite his own name like his betters!"\r\n\r\n"Well, Job," said Handy, trying to impart to his own sour,\r\nill-omened visage a smile of approbation, in which he greatly\r\nfailed; "so you\'re ready now, Mr Finney says; here\'s the\r\nplace, d\'ye see;"--and he put his huge brown finger down on\r\nthe dirty paper;--"name or mark, it\'s all one.  Come along,\r\nold boy; if so be we\'re to have the spending of this money,\r\nwhy the sooner the better,--that\'s my maxim."\r\n\r\n"To be sure," said Moody.  "We a\'n\'t none of us so young; we can\'t\r\nstay waiting for old Catgut no longer."\r\n\r\nIt was thus these miscreants named our excellent friend.  The nickname\r\nhe could easily have forgiven, but the allusion to the divine source\r\nof all his melodious joy would have irritated even him.  Let us hope\r\nhe never knew the insult.\r\n\r\n"Only think, old Billy Gazy," said Spriggs, who rejoiced in greater\r\nyouth than his brethren, but having fallen into a fire when drunk, had\r\nhad one eye burnt out, one cheek burnt through, and one arm nearly\r\nburnt off, and who, therefore, in regard to personal appearance, was\r\nnot the most prepossessing of men, "a hundred a year, and all to\r\nspend; only think, old Billy Gazy;" and he gave a hideous grin that\r\nshowed off his misfortunes to their full extent.\r\n\r\nOld Billy Gazy was not alive to much enthusiasm.  Even these golden\r\nprospects did not arouse him to do more than rub his poor old bleared\r\neyes with the cuff of his bedesman\'s gown, and gently mutter: "he\r\ndidn\'t know, not he; he didn\'t know."\r\n\r\n"But you\'d know, Jonathan," continued Spriggs, turning to the other\r\nfriend of Skulpit\'s, who was sitting on a stool by the table, gazing\r\nvacantly at the petition.  Jonathan Crumple was a meek, mild man, who\r\nhad known better days; his means had been wasted by bad children,\r\nwho had made his life wretched till he had been received into the\r\nhospital, of which he had not long been a member.  Since that day he\r\nhad known neither sorrow nor trouble, and this attempt to fill him\r\nwith new hopes was, indeed, a cruelty.\r\n\r\n"A hundred a year\'s a nice thing, for sartain, neighbour Spriggs,"\r\nsaid he.  "I once had nigh to that myself, but it didn\'t do me no\r\ngood."  And he gave a low sigh, as he thought of the children of his\r\nown loins who had robbed him.\r\n\r\n"And shall have again, Joe," said Handy; "and will have someone to\r\nkeep it right and tight for you this time."\r\n\r\nCrumple sighed again;--he had learned the impotency of worldly wealth,\r\nand would have been satisfied, if left untempted, to have remained\r\nhappy with one and sixpence a day.\r\n\r\n"Come, Skulpit," repeated Handy, getting impatient, "you\'re not going\r\nto go along with old Bunce in helping that parson to rob us all.\r\nTake the pen, man, and right yourself.  Well," he added, seeing that\r\nSkulpit still doubted, "to see a man as is afraid to stand by hisself\r\nis, to my thinking, the meanest thing as is."\r\n\r\n"Sink them all for parsons, says I," growled Moody; "hungry beggars,\r\nas never thinks their bellies full till they have robbed all and\r\neverything!"\r\n\r\n"Who\'s to harm you, man?" argued Spriggs.  "Let them look never so\r\nblack at you, they can\'t get you put out when you\'re once in;--no,\r\nnot old Catgut, with Calves to help him!"  I am sorry to say the\r\narchdeacon himself was designated by this scurrilous allusion to his\r\nnether person.\r\n\r\n"A hundred a year to win, and nothing to lose," continued Handy.  "My\r\neyes!  Well, how a man\'s to doubt about sich a bit of cheese as that\r\npasses me;--but some men is timorous;--some men is born with no pluck\r\nin them;--some men is cowed at the very first sight of a gentleman\'s\r\ncoat and waistcoat."\r\n\r\nOh, Mr Harding, if you had but taken the archdeacon\'s advice in that\r\ndisputed case, when Joe Mutters was this ungrateful demagogue\'s rival\r\ncandidate!\r\n\r\n"Afraid of a parson," growled Moody, with a look of ineffable scorn.\r\n"I tell ye what I\'d be afraid of--I\'d be afraid of not getting nothing\r\nfrom \'em but just what I could take by might and right;--that\'s the\r\nmost I\'d be afraid on of any parson of \'em all."\r\n\r\n"But," said Skulpit, apologetically, "Mr Harding\'s not so bad;--he did\r\ngive us twopence a day, didn\'t he now?"\r\n\r\n"Twopence a day!" exclaimed Spriggs with scorn, opening awfully the\r\nred cavern of his lost eye.\r\n\r\n"Twopence a day!" muttered Moody with a curse; "sink his twopence!"\r\n\r\n"Twopence a day!" exclaimed Handy; "and I\'m to go, hat in hand, and\r\nthank a chap for twopence a day, when he owes me a hundred pounds a\r\nyear; no, thank ye; that may do for you, but it won\'t for me.  Come,\r\nI say, Skulpit, are you a going to put your mark to this here paper,\r\nor are you not?"\r\n\r\nSkulpit looked round in wretched indecision to his two friends.  "What\r\nd\'ye think, Bill Gazy?" said he.\r\n\r\nBut Bill Gazy couldn\'t think.  He made a noise like the bleating of an\r\nold sheep, which was intended to express the agony of his doubt, and\r\nagain muttered that "he didn\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Take hold, you old cripple," said Handy, thrusting the pen into poor\r\nBilly\'s hand: "there, so--ugh! you old fool, you\'ve been and smeared\r\nit all,--there,--that\'ll do for you;--that\'s as good as the best\r\nname as ever was written": and a big blotch of ink was presumed to\r\nrepresent Billy Gazy\'s acquiescence.\r\n\r\n"Now, Jonathan," said Handy, turning to Crumple.\r\n\r\n"A hundred a year\'s a nice thing, for sartain," again argued Crumple.\r\n"Well, neighbour Skulpit, how\'s it to be?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, please yourself," said Skulpit: "please yourself, and you\'ll\r\nplease me."\r\n\r\nThe pen was thrust into Crumple\'s hand, and a faint, wandering,\r\nmeaningless sign was made, betokening such sanction and authority as\r\nJonathan Crumple was able to convey.\r\n\r\n"Come, Job," said Handy, softened by success, "don\'t let \'em have to\r\nsay that old Bunce has a man like you under his thumb,--a man that\r\nalways holds his head in the hospital as high as Bunce himself, though\r\nyou\'re never axed to drink wine, and sneak, and tell lies about your\r\nbetters as he does."\r\n\r\nSkulpit held the pen, and made little flourishes with it in the air,\r\nbut still hesitated.\r\n\r\n"And if you\'ll be said by me," continued Handy, "you\'ll not write your\r\nname to it at all, but just put your mark like the others;"--the cloud\r\nbegan to clear from Skulpit\'s brow;--"we all know you can do it if you\r\nlike, but maybe you wouldn\'t like to seem uppish, you know."\r\n\r\n"Well, the mark would be best," said Skulpit.  "One name and the rest\r\nmarks wouldn\'t look well, would it?"\r\n\r\n"The worst in the world," said Handy; "there--there": and stooping\r\nover the petition, the learned clerk made a huge cross on the place\r\nleft for his signature.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the game," said Handy, triumphantly pocketing the petition;\r\n"we\'re all in a boat now, that is, the nine of us; and as for old\r\nBunce, and his cronies, they may--"  But as he was hobbling off to the\r\ndoor, with a crutch on one side and a stick on the other, he was met\r\nby Bunce himself.\r\n\r\n"Well Handy, and what may old Bunce do?" said the gray-haired, upright\r\nsenior.\r\n\r\nHandy muttered something, and was departing; but he was stopped in the\r\ndoorway by the huge frame of the newcomer.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been doing no good here, Abel Handy," said he, "\'tis plain to\r\nsee that; and \'tisn\'t much good, I\'m thinking, you ever do."\r\n\r\n"I mind my own business, Master Bunce," muttered the other, "and do\r\nyou do the same.  It ain\'t nothing to you what I does;--and your\r\nspying and poking here won\'t do no good nor yet no harm."\r\n\r\n"I suppose then, Job," continued Bunce, not noticing his opponent, "if\r\nthe truth must out, you\'ve stuck your name to that petition of theirs\r\nat last."\r\n\r\nSkulpit looked as though he were about to sink into the ground with\r\nshame.\r\n\r\n"What is it to you what he signs?" said Handy.  "I suppose if we all\r\nwants to ax for our own, we needn\'t ax leave of you first, Mr Bunce,\r\nbig a man as you are; and as to your sneaking in here, into Job\'s room\r\nwhen he\'s busy, and where you\'re not wanted--"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve knowed Job Skulpit, man and boy, sixty years," said Bunce,\r\nlooking at the man of whom he spoke, "and that\'s ever since the day\r\nhe was born.  I knowed the mother that bore him, when she and I were\r\nlittle wee things, picking daisies together in the close yonder; and\r\nI\'ve lived under the same roof with him more nor ten years; and after\r\nthat I may come into his room without axing leave, and yet no sneaking\r\nneither."\r\n\r\n"So you can, Mr Bunce," said Skulpit; "so you can, any hour, day or\r\nnight."\r\n\r\n"And I\'m free also to tell him my mind," continued Bunce, looking at\r\nthe one man and addressing the other; "and I tell him now that he\'s\r\ndone a foolish and a wrong thing.  He\'s turned his back upon one\r\nwho is his best friend; and is playing the game of others, who care\r\nnothing for him, whether he be poor or rich, well or ill, alive or\r\ndead.  A hundred a year?  Are the lot of you soft enough to think that\r\nif a hundred a year be to be given, it\'s the likes of you that will\r\nget it?"--and he pointed to Billy Gazy, Spriggs, and Crumple.  "Did\r\nany of us ever do anything worth half the money?  Was it to make\r\ngentlemen of us we were brought in here, when all the world turned\r\nagainst us, and we couldn\'t longer earn our daily bread?  A\'n\'t you\r\nall as rich in your ways as he in his?"--and the orator pointed to\r\nthe side on which the warden lived.  "A\'n\'t you getting all you hoped\r\nfor, ay, and more than you hoped for?  Wouldn\'t each of you have given\r\nthe dearest limb of his body to secure that which now makes you so\r\nunthankful?"\r\n\r\n"We wants what John Hiram left us," said Handy.  "We wants what\'s ourn\r\nby law; it don\'t matter what we expected.  What\'s ourn by law should\r\nbe ourn, and by goles we\'ll have it."\r\n\r\n"Law!" said Bunce, with all the scorn he knew how to command--"law!\r\nDid ye ever know a poor man yet was the better for law, or for a\r\nlawyer?  Will Mr Finney ever be as good to you, Job, as that man has\r\nbeen?  Will he see to you when you\'re sick, and comfort you when\r\nyou\'re wretched? Will he--"\r\n\r\n"No, nor give you port wine, old boy, on cold winter nights! he won\'t\r\ndo that, will he?" asked Handy; and laughing at the severity of his\r\nown wit, he and his colleagues retired, carrying with them, however,\r\nthe now powerful petition.\r\n\r\nThere is no help for spilt milk; and Mr Bunce could only retire to\r\nhis own room, disgusted at the frailty of human nature.  Job Skulpit\r\nscratched his head;--Jonathan Crumple again remarked, that, "for\r\nsartain, sure a hundred a year was very nice;"--and Billy Gazy again\r\nrubbed his eyes, and lowly muttered that "he didn\'t know."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\n\r\nDR GRANTLY VISITS THE HOSPITAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThough doubt and hesitation disturbed the rest of our poor warden, no\r\nsuch weakness perplexed the nobler breast of his son-in-law.  As the\r\nindomitable cock preparing for the combat sharpens his spurs, shakes\r\nhis feathers, and erects his comb, so did the archdeacon arrange his\r\nweapons for the coming war, without misgiving and without fear.  That\r\nhe was fully confident of the justice of his cause let no one doubt.\r\nMany a man can fight his battle with good courage, but with a doubting\r\nconscience.  Such was not the case with Dr Grantly.  He did not\r\nbelieve in the Gospel with more assurance than he did in the sacred\r\njustice of all ecclesiastical revenues.  When he put his shoulder to\r\nthe wheel to defend the income of the present and future precentors\r\nof Barchester, he was animated by as strong a sense of a holy cause,\r\nas that which gives courage to a missionary in Africa, or enables a\r\nsister of mercy to give up the pleasures of the world for the wards\r\nof a hospital.  He was about to defend the holy of holies from the\r\ntouch of the profane; to guard the citadel of his church from the\r\nmost rampant of its enemies; to put on his good armour in the best of\r\nfights, and secure, if possible, the comforts of his creed for coming\r\ngenerations of ecclesiastical dignitaries.  Such a work required no\r\nordinary vigour; and the archdeacon was, therefore, extraordinarily\r\nvigorous.  It demanded a buoyant courage, and a heart happy in its\r\ntoil; and the archdeacon\'s heart was happy, and his courage was\r\nbuoyant.\r\n\r\nHe knew that he would not be able to animate his father-in-law\r\nwith feelings like his own, but this did not much disturb him.  He\r\npreferred to bear the brunt of the battle alone, and did not doubt\r\nthat the warden would resign himself into his hands with passive\r\nsubmission.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr Chadwick," he said, walking into the steward\'s office a day\r\nor two after the signing of the petition as commemorated in the last\r\nchapter: "anything from Cox and Cummins this morning?"  Mr Chadwick\r\nhanded him a letter; which he read, stroking the tight-gaitered calf\r\nof his right leg as he did so.  Messrs Cox and Cummins merely said\r\nthat they had as yet received no notice from their adversaries;\r\nthat they could recommend no preliminary steps; but that should any\r\nproceeding really be taken by the bedesmen, it would be expedient to\r\nconsult that very eminent Queen\'s Counsel, Sir Abraham Haphazard.\r\n\r\n"I quite agree with them," said Dr Grantly, refolding the letter.\r\n"I perfectly agree with them.  Haphazard is no doubt the best man; a\r\nthorough churchman, a sound conservative, and in every respect the\r\nbest man we could get;--he\'s in the House, too, which is a great\r\nthing."\r\n\r\nMr Chadwick quite agreed.\r\n\r\n"You remember how completely he put down that scoundrel Horseman about\r\nthe Bishop of Beverley\'s income; how completely he set them all adrift\r\nin the earl\'s case."  Since the question of St Cross had been mooted\r\nby the public, one noble lord had become "the earl," _par excellence_,\r\nin the doctor\'s estimation.  "How he silenced that fellow at\r\nRochester.  Of course we must have Haphazard; and I\'ll tell you what,\r\nMr Chadwick, we must take care to be in time, or the other party will\r\nforestall us."\r\n\r\nWith all his admiration for Sir Abraham, the doctor seemed to think\r\nit not impossible that that great man might be induced to lend his\r\ngigantic powers to the side of the church\'s enemies.\r\n\r\nHaving settled this point to his satisfaction, the doctor stepped down\r\nto the hospital, to learn how matters were going on there; and as he\r\nwalked across the hallowed close, and looked up at the ravens who\r\ncawed with a peculiar reverence as he wended his way, he thought with\r\nincreased acerbity of those whose impiety would venture to disturb the\r\ngoodly grace of cathedral institutions.\r\n\r\nAnd who has not felt the same?  We believe that Mr Horseman himself\r\nwould relent, and the spirit of Sir Benjamin Hall give way, were those\r\ngreat reformers to allow themselves to stroll by moonlight round the\r\ntowers of some of our ancient churches.  Who would not feel charity\r\nfor a prebendary when walking the quiet length of that long aisle at\r\nWinchester, looking at those decent houses, that trim grass-plat, and\r\nfeeling, as one must, the solemn, orderly comfort of the spot!  Who\r\ncould be hard upon a dean while wandering round the sweet close of\r\nHereford, and owning that in that precinct, tone and colour, design\r\nand form, solemn tower and storied window, are all in unison, and all\r\nperfect!  Who could lie basking in the cloisters of Salisbury, and\r\ngaze on Jewel\'s library and that unequalled spire, without feeling\r\nthat bishops should sometimes be rich!\r\n\r\nThe tone of our archdeacon\'s mind must not astonish us; it has been\r\nthe growth of centuries of church ascendancy; and though some fungi\r\nnow disfigure the tree, though there be much dead wood, for how much\r\ngood fruit have not we to be thankful?  Who, without remorse, can\r\nbatter down the dead branches of an old oak, now useless, but, ah!\r\nstill so beautiful, or drag out the fragments of the ancient forest,\r\nwithout feeling that they sheltered the younger plants, to which they\r\nare now summoned to give way in a tone so peremptory and so harsh?\r\n\r\nThe archdeacon, with all his virtues, was not a man of delicate\r\nfeeling; and after having made his morning salutations in the warden\'s\r\ndrawing-room, he did not scruple to commence an attack on "pestilent"\r\nJohn Bold in the presence of Miss Harding, though he rightly guessed\r\nthat that lady was not indifferent to the name of his enemy.\r\n\r\n"Nelly, my dear, fetch me my spectacles from the back room," said her\r\nfather, anxious to save both her blushes and her feelings.\r\n\r\nEleanor brought the spectacles, while her father was trying, in\r\nambiguous phrases, to explain to her too-practical brother-in-law that\r\nit might be as well not to say anything about Bold before her, and\r\nthen retreated.  Nothing had been explained to her about Bold and the\r\nhospital; but, with a woman\'s instinct she knew that things were going\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\n"We must soon be doing something," commenced the archdeacon, wiping\r\nhis brows with a large, bright-coloured handkerchief, for he had felt\r\nbusy, and had walked quick, and it was a broiling summer\'s day.  "Of\r\ncourse you have heard of the petition?"\r\n\r\nMr Harding owned, somewhat unwillingly, that he had heard of it.\r\n\r\n"Well!"--the archdeacon looked for some expressions of opinion, but\r\nnone coming, he continued,--"We must be doing something, you know; we\r\nmustn\'t allow these people to cut the ground from under us while we\r\nsit looking on."  The archdeacon, who was a practical man, allowed\r\nhimself the use of everyday expressive modes of speech when among his\r\nclosest intimates, though no one could soar into a more intricate\r\nlabyrinth of refined phraseology when the church was the subject, and\r\nhis lower brethren were his auditors.\r\n\r\nThe warden still looked mutely in his face, making the slightest\r\npossible passes with an imaginary fiddle bow, and stopping, as he\r\ndid so, sundry imaginary strings with the fingers of his other hand.\r\n\'Twas his constant consolation in conversational troubles.  While\r\nthese vexed him sorely, the passes would be short and slow, and the\r\nupper hand would not be seen to work; nay, the strings on which it\r\noperated would sometimes lie concealed in the musician\'s pocket, and\r\nthe instrument on which he played would be beneath his chair;--but as\r\nhis spirit warmed to the subject,--as his trusting heart looking to\r\nthe bottom of that which vexed him, would see its clear way out,--he\r\nwould rise to a higher melody, sweep the unseen strings with a bolder\r\nhand, and swiftly fingering the cords from his neck, down along his\r\nwaistcoat, and up again to his very ear, create an ecstatic strain of\r\nperfect music, audible to himself and to St Cecilia, and not without\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n"I quite agree with Cox and Cummins," continued the archdeacon.\r\n"They say we must secure Sir Abraham Haphazard.  I shall not have\r\nthe slightest fear in leaving the case in Sir Abraham\'s hands."\r\n\r\nThe warden played the slowest and saddest of tunes.  It was but a\r\ndirge on one string.\r\n\r\n"I think Sir Abraham will not be long in letting Master Bold know what\r\nhe\'s about.  I fancy I hear Sir Abraham cross-questioning him at the\r\nCommon Pleas."\r\n\r\nThe warden thought of his income being thus discussed, his modest\r\nlife, his daily habits, and his easy work; and nothing issued from\r\nthat single cord, but a low wail of sorrow.  "I suppose they\'ve sent\r\nthis petition up to my father."  The warden didn\'t know; he imagined\r\nthey would do so this very day.\r\n\r\n"What I can\'t understand is, how you let them do it, with such a\r\ncommand as you have in the place, or should have with such a man as\r\nBunce.  I cannot understand why you let them do it."\r\n\r\n"Do what?" asked the warden.\r\n\r\n"Why, listen to this fellow Bold, and that other low pettifogger,\r\nFinney;--and get up this petition too.  Why didn\'t you tell Bunce to\r\ndestroy the petition?"\r\n\r\n"That would have been hardly wise," said the warden.\r\n\r\n"Wise;--yes, it would have been very wise if they\'d done it among\r\nthemselves.  I must go up to the palace and answer it now, I suppose.\r\nIt\'s a very short answer they\'ll get, I can tell you."\r\n\r\n"But why shouldn\'t they petition, doctor?"\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t they!" responded the archdeacon, in a loud brazen\r\nvoice, as though all the men in the hospital were expected to hear him\r\nthrough the walls; "why shouldn\'t they?  I\'ll let them know why they\r\nshouldn\'t; by the bye, warden, I\'d like to say a few words to them all\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\nThe warden\'s mind misgave him, and even for a moment he forgot to\r\nplay.  He by no means wished to delegate to his son-in-law his place\r\nand authority of warden; he had expressly determined not to interfere\r\nin any step which the men might wish to take in the matter under\r\ndispute; he was most anxious neither to accuse them nor to defend\r\nhimself.  All these things he was aware the archdeacon would do in his\r\nbehalf, and that not in the mildest manner; and yet he knew not how to\r\nrefuse the permission requested.\r\n\r\n"I\'d so much sooner remain quiet in the matter," said he, in an\r\napologetic voice.\r\n\r\n"Quiet!" said the archdeacon, still speaking with his brazen trumpet;\r\n"do you wish to be ruined in quiet?"\r\n\r\n"Why, if I am to be ruined, certainly."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, warden; I tell you something must be done;--we must act;\r\njust let me ring the bell, and send the men word that I\'ll speak to\r\nthem in the quad."\r\n\r\nMr Harding knew not how to resist, and the disagreeable order was\r\ngiven.  The quad, as it was familiarly called, was a small quadrangle,\r\nopen on one side to the river, and surrounded on the others by the\r\nhigh wall of Mr Harding\'s garden, by one gable end of Mr Harding\'s\r\nhouse, and by the end of the row of buildings which formed the\r\nresidences of the bedesmen.  It was flagged all round, and the centre\r\nwas stoned; small stone gutters ran from the four corners of the\r\nsquare to a grating in the centre; and attached to the end of Mr\r\nHarding\'s house was a conduit with four cocks covered over from the\r\nweather, at which the old men got their water, and very generally\r\nperformed their morning toilet.  It was a quiet, sombre place, shaded\r\nover by the trees of the warden\'s garden.  On the side towards the\r\nriver, there stood a row of stone seats, on which the old men would\r\nsit and gaze at the little fish, as they flitted by in the running\r\nstream.  On the other side of the river was a rich, green meadow,\r\nrunning up to and joining the deanery, and as little open to the\r\npublic as the garden of the dean itself.  Nothing, therefore, could be\r\nmore private than the quad of the hospital; and it was there that the\r\narchdeacon determined to convey to them his sense of their refractory\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nThe servant soon brought in word that the men were assembled in the\r\nquad, and the archdeacon, big with his purpose, rose to address them.\r\n\r\n"Well, warden, of course you\'re coming," said he, seeing that Mr\r\nHarding did not prepare to follow him.\r\n\r\n"I wish you\'d excuse me," said Mr Harding.\r\n\r\n"For heaven\'s sake, don\'t let us have division in the camp," replied\r\nthe archdeacon: "let us have a long pull and a strong pull, but above\r\nall a pull all together; come, warden, come; don\'t be afraid of your\r\nduty."\r\n\r\nMr Harding was afraid; he was afraid that he was being led to do that\r\nwhich was not his duty; he was not, however, strong enough to resist,\r\nso he got up and followed his son-in-law.\r\n\r\nThe old men were assembled in groups in the quadrangle--eleven of them\r\nat least, for poor old Johnny Bell was bed-ridden, and couldn\'t come;\r\nhe had, however, put his mark to the petition, as one of Handy\'s\r\nearliest followers.  \'Tis true he could not move from the bed where\r\nhe lay; \'tis true he had no friend on earth, but those whom the\r\nhospital contained; and of those the warden and his daughter were\r\nthe most constant and most appreciated; \'tis true that everything was\r\nadministered to him which his failing body could require, or which his\r\nfaint appetite could enjoy; but still his dull eye had glistened for a\r\nmoment at the idea of possessing a hundred pounds a year "to his own\r\ncheek," as Abel Handy had eloquently expressed it; and poor old Johnny\r\nBell had greedily put his mark to the petition.\r\n\r\nWhen the two clergymen appeared, they all uncovered their heads.\r\nHandy was slow to do it, and hesitated; but the black coat and\r\nwaistcoat of which he had spoken so irreverently in Skulpit\'s room,\r\nhad its effect even on him, and he too doffed his hat.  Bunce,\r\nadvancing before the others, bowed lowly to the archdeacon, and with\r\naffectionate reverence expressed his wish, that the warden and Miss\r\nEleanor were quite well; "and the doctor\'s lady," he added, turning\r\nto the archdeacon, "and the children at Plumstead, and my lord;" and\r\nhaving made his speech, he also retired among the others, and took\r\nhis place with the rest upon the stone benches.\r\n\r\nAs the archdeacon stood up to make his speech, erect in the middle of\r\nthat little square, he looked like an ecclesiastical statue placed\r\nthere, as a fitting impersonation of the church militant here on\r\nearth; his shovel hat, large, new, and well-pronounced, a churchman\'s\r\nhat in every inch, declared the profession as plainly as does the\r\nQuaker\'s broad brim; his heavy eyebrows, large open eyes, and full\r\nmouth and chin expressed the solidity of his order; the broad chest,\r\namply covered with fine cloth, told how well to do was its estate; one\r\nhand ensconced within his pocket, evinced the practical hold which our\r\nmother church keeps on her temporal possessions; and the other, loose\r\nfor action, was ready to fight if need be in her defence; and, below\r\nthese, the decorous breeches, and neat black gaiters showing so\r\nadmirably that well-turned leg, betokened the decency, the outward\r\nbeauty and grace of our church establishment.\r\n\r\n"Now, my men," he began, when he had settled himself well in his\r\nposition, "I want to say a few words to you.  Your good friend, the\r\nwarden here, and myself, and my lord the bishop, on whose behalf I\r\nwish to speak to you, would all be very sorry, very sorry indeed,\r\nthat you should have any just ground of complaint.  Any just ground\r\nof complaint on your part would be removed at once by the warden, or\r\nby his lordship, or by me on his behalf, without the necessity of\r\nany petition on your part."  Here the orator stopped for a moment,\r\nexpecting that some little murmurs of applause would show that\r\nthe weakest of the men were beginning to give way; but no such\r\nmurmurs came.  Bunce, himself, even sat with closed lips, mute and\r\nunsatisfactory.  "Without the necessity of any petition at all," he\r\nrepeated.  "I\'m told you have addressed a petition to my lord."  He\r\npaused for a reply from the men, and after a while, Handy plucked up\r\ncourage and said, "Yes, we has."\r\n\r\n"You have addressed a petition to my lord, in which, as I am informed,\r\nyou express an opinion that you do not receive from Hiram\'s estate all\r\nthat is your due."  Here most of the men expressed their assent.  "Now\r\nwhat is it you ask for?  What is it you want that you hav\'n\'t got\r\nhere?  What is it--"\r\n\r\n"A hundred a year," muttered old Moody, with a voice as if it came out\r\nof the ground.\r\n\r\n"A hundred a year!" ejaculated the archdeacon militant, defying the\r\nimpudence of these claimants with one hand stretched out and closed,\r\nwhile with the other he tightly grasped, and secured within his\r\nbreeches pocket, that symbol of the church\'s wealth which his own\r\nloose half-crowns not unaptly represented.  "A hundred a year!\r\nWhy, my men, you must be mad; and you talk about John Hiram\'s will!\r\nWhen John Hiram built a hospital for worn-out old men, worn-out old\r\nlabouring men, infirm old men past their work, cripples, blind,\r\nbed-ridden, and such like, do you think he meant to make gentlemen of\r\nthem?  Do you think John Hiram intended to give a hundred a year to\r\nold single men, who earned perhaps two shillings or half-a-crown a day\r\nfor themselves and families in the best of their time?  No, my men,\r\nI\'ll tell you what John Hiram meant: he meant that twelve poor old\r\nworn-out labourers, men who could no longer support themselves, who\r\nhad no friends to support them, who must starve and perish miserably\r\nif not protected by the hand of charity;--he meant that twelve such\r\nmen as these should come in here in their poverty and wretchedness,\r\nand find within these walls shelter and food before their death, and a\r\nlittle leisure to make their peace with God.  That was what John Hiram\r\nmeant: you have not read John Hiram\'s will, and I doubt whether those\r\nwicked men who are advising you have done so.  I have; I know what his\r\nwill was; and I tell you that that was his will, and that that was his\r\nintention."\r\n\r\nNot a sound came from the eleven bedesmen, as they sat listening to\r\nwhat, according to the archdeacon, was their intended estate.  They\r\ngrimly stared upon his burly figure, but did not then express, by word\r\nor sign, the anger and disgust to which such language was sure to give\r\nrise.\r\n\r\n"Now let me ask you," he continued: "do you think you are worse off\r\nthan John Hiram intended to make you?  Have you not shelter, and food,\r\nand leisure?  Have you not much more?  Have you not every indulgence\r\nwhich you are capable of enjoying?  Have you not twice better food,\r\ntwice a better bed, ten times more money in your pocket than you were\r\never able to earn for yourselves before you were lucky enough to get\r\ninto this place?  And now you send a petition to the bishop, asking\r\nfor a hundred pounds a year!  I tell you what, my friends; you are\r\ndeluded, and made fools of by wicked men who are acting for their\r\nown ends.  You will never get a hundred pence a year more than what\r\nyou have now: it is very possible that you may get less; it is very\r\npossible that my lord the bishop, and your warden, may make changes--"\r\n\r\n"No, no, no," interrupted Mr Harding, who had been listening with\r\nindescribable misery to the tirade of his son-in-law; "no, my friends.\r\nI want no changes,--at least no changes that shall make you worse off\r\nthan you now are, as long as you and I live together."\r\n\r\n"God bless you, Mr Harding," said Bunce; and "God bless you, Mr\r\nHarding, God bless you, sir: we know you was always our friend," was\r\nexclaimed by enough of the men to make it appear that the sentiment\r\nwas general.\r\n\r\nThe archdeacon had been interrupted in his speech before he had quite\r\nfinished it; but he felt that he could not recommence with dignity\r\nafter this little ebullition, and he led the way back into the garden,\r\nfollowed by his father-in-law.\r\n\r\n"Well," said he, as soon as he found himself within the cool retreat\r\nof the warden\'s garden; "I think I spoke to them plainly."  And he\r\nwiped the perspiration from his brow; for making a speech under a\r\nbroiling mid-day sun in summer, in a full suit of thick black cloth,\r\nis warm work.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you were plain enough," replied the warden, in a tone which did\r\nnot express approbation.\r\n\r\n"And that\'s everything," said the other, who was clearly well\r\nsatisfied with himself; "that\'s everything: with those sort of people\r\none must be plain, or one will not be understood.  Now, I think they\r\ndid understand me;--I think they knew what I meant."\r\n\r\nThe warden agreed.  He certainly thought they had understood to the\r\nfull what had been said to them.\r\n\r\n"They know pretty well what they have to expect from us; they know how\r\nwe shall meet any refractory spirit on their part; they know that we\r\nare not afraid of them.  And now I\'ll just step into Chadwick\'s, and\r\ntell him what I\'ve done; and then I\'ll go up to the palace, and answer\r\nthis petition of theirs."\r\n\r\nThe warden\'s mind was very full,--full nearly to overcharging itself;\r\nand had it done so,--had he allowed himself to speak the thoughts\r\nwhich were working within him, he would indeed have astonished the\r\narchdeacon by the reprobation he would have expressed as to the\r\nproceeding of which he had been so unwilling a witness.  But different\r\nfeelings kept him silent; he was as yet afraid of differing from his\r\nson-in-law;--he was anxious beyond measure to avoid even a semblance\r\nof rupture with any of his order, and was painfully fearful of having\r\nto come to an open quarrel with any person on any subject.  His life\r\nhad hitherto been so quiet, so free from strife; his little early\r\ntroubles had required nothing but passive fortitude; his subsequent\r\nprosperity had never forced upon him any active cares,--had never\r\nbrought him into disagreeable contact with anyone.  He felt that\r\nhe would give almost anything,--much more than he knew he ought to\r\ndo,--to relieve himself from the storm which he feared was coming.\r\nIt was so hard that the pleasant waters of his little stream should be\r\ndisturbed and muddied by rough hands; that his quiet paths should be\r\nmade a battlefield; that the unobtrusive corner of the world which had\r\nbeen allotted to him, as though by Providence, should be invaded and\r\ndesecrated, and all within it made miserable and unsound.\r\n\r\nMoney he had none to give; the knack of putting guineas together\r\nhad never belonged to him; but how willingly, with what a foolish\r\neasiness, with what happy alacrity, would he have abandoned the half\r\nof his income for all time to come, could he by so doing have quietly\r\ndispelled the clouds that were gathering over him,--could he have thus\r\ncompromised the matter between the reformer and the conservative,\r\nbetween his possible son-in-law, Bold, and his positive son-in-law,\r\nthe archdeacon.\r\n\r\nAnd this compromise would not have been made from any prudential\r\nmotive of saving what would yet remain, for Mr Harding still felt\r\nlittle doubt but he should be left for life in quiet possession of the\r\ngood things he had, if he chose to retain them.  No; he would have\r\ndone so from the sheer love of quiet, and from a horror of being made\r\nthe subject of public talk.  He had very often been moved to pity.--to\r\nthat inward weeping of the heart for others\' woes; but none had he\r\never pitied more than that old lord, whose almost fabulous wealth,\r\ndrawn from his church preferments, had become the subject of so much\r\nopprobrium, of such public scorn; that wretched clerical octogenarian\r\nCroesus, whom men would not allow to die in peace,--whom all the world\r\nunited to decry and to abhor.\r\n\r\nWas he to suffer such a fate?  Was his humble name to be bandied in\r\nmen\'s mouths, as the gormandiser of the resources of the poor, as\r\nof one who had filched from the charity of other ages wealth which\r\nhad been intended to relieve the old and the infirm?  Was he to be\r\ngibbeted in the press, to become a byword for oppression, to be named\r\nas an example of the greed of the English church?  Should it ever\r\nbe said that he had robbed those old men, whom he so truly and so\r\ntenderly loved in his heart of hearts?  As he slowly paced, hour after\r\nhour, under those noble lime-trees, turning these sad thoughts within\r\nhim, he became all but fixed in his resolve that some great step must\r\nbe taken to relieve him from the risk of so terrible a fate.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the archdeacon, with contented mind and unruffled\r\nspirit, went about his business.  He said a word or two to Mr\r\nChadwick, and then finding, as he expected, the petition lying in his\r\nfather\'s library, he wrote a short answer to the men, in which he told\r\nthem that they had no evils to redress, but rather great mercies for\r\nwhich to be thankful; and having seen the bishop sign it, he got into\r\nhis brougham and returned home to Mrs Grantly, and Plumstead Episcopi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\n\r\nTHE WARDEN\'S TEA PARTY\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter much painful doubting, on one thing only could Mr Harding\r\nresolve.  He determined that at any rate he would take no offence, and\r\nthat he would make this question no cause of quarrel either with Bold\r\nor with the bedesmen.  In furtherance of this resolution, he himself\r\nwrote a note to Mr Bold, the same afternoon, inviting him to meet a\r\nfew friends and hear some music on an evening named in the next week.\r\nHad not this little party been promised to Eleanor, in his present\r\nstate of mind he would probably have avoided such gaiety; but the\r\npromise had been given, the invitations were to be written, and when\r\nEleanor consulted her father on the subject, she was not ill pleased\r\nto hear him say, "Oh, I was thinking of Bold, so I took it into my\r\nhead to write to him myself, but you must write to his sister."\r\n\r\nMary Bold was older than her brother, and, at the time of our story,\r\nwas just over thirty.  She was not an unattractive young woman, though\r\nby no means beautiful.  Her great merit was the kindliness of her\r\ndisposition.  She was not very clever, nor very animated, nor had she\r\napparently the energy of her brother; but she was guided by a high\r\nprinciple of right and wrong; her temper was sweet, and her faults\r\nwere fewer in number than her virtues.  Those who casually met Mary\r\nBold thought little of her; but those who knew her well loved her\r\nwell, and the longer they knew her the more they loved her.  Among\r\nthose who were fondest of her was Eleanor Harding; and though Eleanor\r\nhad never openly talked to her of her brother, each understood the\r\nother\'s feelings about him.  The brother and sister were sitting\r\ntogether when the two notes were brought in.\r\n\r\n"How odd," said Mary, "that they should send two notes.  Well, if Mr\r\nHarding becomes fashionable, the world is going to change."\r\n\r\nHer brother understood immediately the nature and intention of the\r\npeace-offering; but it was not so easy for him to behave well in the\r\nmatter, as it was for Mr Harding.  It is much less difficult for the\r\nsufferer to be generous than for the oppressor.  John Bold felt that\r\nhe could not go to the warden\'s party: he never loved Eleanor better\r\nthan he did now; he had never so strongly felt how anxious he was\r\nto make her his wife as now, when so many obstacles to his doing\r\nso appeared in view.  Yet here was her father himself, as it were,\r\nclearing away those very obstacles, and still he felt that he could\r\nnot go to the house any more as an open friend.\r\n\r\nAs he sat thinking of these things with the note in his hand, his\r\nsister was waiting for his decision.\r\n\r\n"Well," said she, "I suppose we must write separate answers, and both\r\nsay we shall be very happy."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll go, of course, Mary," said he; to which she readily assented.\r\n"I cannot," he continued, looking serious and gloomy.  "I wish I\r\ncould, with all my heart."\r\n\r\n"And why not, John?" said she.  She had as yet heard nothing of the\r\nnew-found abuse which her brother was about to reform;--at least\r\nnothing which connected it with her brother\'s name.\r\n\r\nHe sat thinking for a while till he determined that it would be best\r\nto tell her at once what it was that he was about: it must be done\r\nsooner or later.\r\n\r\n"I fear I cannot go to Mr Harding\'s house any more as a friend, just\r\nat present."\r\n\r\n"Oh, John!  Why not?  Ah, you\'ve quarrelled with Eleanor!"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed," said he; "I\'ve no quarrel with her as yet."\r\n\r\n"What is it, John?" said she, looking at him with an anxious, loving\r\nface, for she knew well how much of his heart was there in that house\r\nwhich he said he could no longer enter.\r\n\r\n"Why," said he at last, "I\'ve taken up the case of these twelve\r\nold men of Hiram\'s Hospital, and of course that brings me into\r\ncontact with Mr Harding.  I may have to oppose him, interfere with\r\nhim,--perhaps injure him."\r\n\r\nMary looked at him steadily for some time before she committed\r\nherself to reply, and then merely asked him what he meant to do\r\nfor the old men.\r\n\r\n"Why, it\'s a long story, and I don\'t know that I can make you\r\nunderstand it.  John Hiram made a will, and left his property in\r\ncharity for certain poor old men, and the proceeds, instead of going\r\nto the benefit of these men, go chiefly into the pocket of the warden\r\nand the bishop\'s steward."\r\n\r\n"And you mean to take away from Mr Harding his share of it?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what I mean yet.  I mean to inquire about it. I mean to\r\nsee who is entitled to this property.  I mean to see, if I can, that\r\njustice be done to the poor of the city of Barchester generally, who\r\nare, in fact, the legatees under the will.  I mean, in short, to put\r\nthe matter right, if I can."\r\n\r\n"And why are you to do this, John?"\r\n\r\n"You might ask the same question of anybody else," said he; "and\r\naccording to that the duty of righting these poor men would belong to\r\nnobody.  If we are to act on that principle, the weak are never to be\r\nprotected, injustice is never to be opposed, and no one is to struggle\r\nfor the poor!"  And Bold began to comfort himself in the warmth of his\r\nown virtue.\r\n\r\n"But is there no one to do this but you, who have known Mr Harding so\r\nlong?  Surely, John, as a friend, as a young friend, so much younger\r\nthan Mr Harding--"\r\n\r\n"That\'s woman\'s logic, all over, Mary.  What has age to do with it?\r\nAnother man might plead that he was too old; and as to his friendship,\r\nif the thing itself be right, private motives should never be allowed\r\nto interfere.  Because I esteem Mr Harding, is that a reason that I\r\nshould neglect a duty which I owe to these old men? or should I give\r\nup a work which my conscience tells me is a good one, because I regret\r\nthe loss of his society?"\r\n\r\n"And Eleanor, John?" said the sister, looking timidly into her\r\nbrother\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Eleanor, that is, Miss Harding, if she thinks fit,--that is, if\r\nher father--or, rather, if she--or, indeed, he,--if they find it\r\nnecessary--but there is no necessity now to talk about Eleanor\r\nHarding; but this I will say, that if she has the kind of spirit for\r\nwhich I give her credit, she will not condemn me for doing what I\r\nthink to be a duty."  And Bold consoled himself with the consolation\r\nof a Roman.\r\n\r\nMary sat silent for a while, till at last her brother reminded her\r\nthat the notes must be answered, and she got up, and placed her desk\r\nbefore her, took out her pen and paper, wrote on it slowly:\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PAKENHAM VILLAS\r\n                              Tuesday morning\r\n   MY DEAR ELEANOR,\r\n\r\n   I--\r\n\r\n\r\nand then stopped, and looked at her brother.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mary, why don\'t you write it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, John," said she, "dear John, pray think better of this."\r\n\r\n"Think better of what?" said he.\r\n\r\n"Of this about the hospital,--of all this about Mr Harding,--of what\r\nyou say about those old men.  Nothing can call upon you,--no duty can\r\nrequire you to set yourself against your oldest, your best friend.\r\nOh, John, think of Eleanor.  You\'ll break her heart, and your own."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, Mary; Miss Harding\'s heart is as safe as yours."\r\n\r\n"Pray, pray, for my sake, John, give it up.  You know how dearly you\r\nlove her."  And she came and knelt before him on the rug.  "Pray\r\ngive it up.  You are going to make yourself, and her, and her father\r\nmiserable: you are going to make us all miserable.  And for what?  For\r\na dream of justice.  You will never make those twelve men happier than\r\nthey now are."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t understand it, my dear girl," said he, smoothing her hair\r\nwith his hand.\r\n\r\n"I do understand it, John.  I understand that this is a chimera,--a\r\ndream that you have got.  I know well that no duty can require you to\r\ndo this mad--this suicidal thing.  I know you love Eleanor Harding\r\nwith all your heart, and I tell you now that she loves you as well.\r\nIf there was a plain, a positive duty before you, I would be the last\r\nto bid you neglect it for any woman\'s love; but this--; oh, think\r\nagain, before you do anything to make it necessary that you and Mr\r\nHarding should be at variance."  He did not answer, as she knelt\r\nthere, leaning on his knees, but by his face she thought that he was\r\ninclined to yield.  "At any rate let me say that you will go to this\r\nparty.  At any rate do not break with them while your mind is in\r\ndoubt."  And she got up, hoping to conclude her note in the way she\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\n"My mind is not in doubt," at last he said, rising.  "I could never\r\nrespect myself again were I to give way now, because Eleanor Harding\r\nis beautiful.  I do love her: I would give a hand to hear her tell\r\nme what you have said, speaking on her behalf; but I cannot for her\r\nsake go back from the task which I have commenced.  I hope she may\r\nhereafter acknowledge and respect my motives, but I cannot now go as\r\na guest to her father\'s house."  And the Barchester Brutus went out\r\nto fortify his own resolution by meditations on his own virtue.\r\n\r\nPoor Mary Bold sat down, and sadly finished her note, saying that she\r\nwould herself attend the party, but that her brother was unavoidably\r\nprevented from doing so.  I fear that she did not admire as she should\r\nhave done the self-devotion of his singular virtue.\r\n\r\nThe party went off as such parties do.  There were fat old ladies, in\r\nfine silk dresses, and slim young ladies, in gauzy muslin frocks; old\r\ngentlemen stood up with their backs to the empty fire-place, looking\r\nby no means so comfortable as they would have done in their own\r\narm-chairs at home; and young gentlemen, rather stiff about the neck,\r\nclustered near the door, not as yet sufficiently in courage to attack\r\nthe muslin frocks, who awaited the battle, drawn up in a semicircular\r\narray.  The warden endeavoured to induce a charge, but failed\r\nsignally, not having the tact of a general; his daughter did what she\r\ncould to comfort the forces under her command, who took in refreshing\r\nrations of cake and tea, and patiently looked for the coming\r\nengagement: but she herself, Eleanor, had no spirit for the work; the\r\nonly enemy whose lance she cared to encounter was not there, and she\r\nand others were somewhat dull.\r\n\r\nLoud above all voices was heard the clear sonorous tones of the\r\narchdeacon as he dilated to brother parsons of the danger of the\r\nchurch, of the fearful rumours of mad reforms even at Oxford, and of\r\nthe damnable heresies of Dr Whiston.\r\n\r\nSoon, however, sweeter sounds began timidly to make themselves\r\naudible.  Little movements were made in a quarter notable for round\r\nstools and music stands.  Wax candles were arranged in sconces, big\r\nbooks were brought from hidden recesses, and the work of the evening\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\nHow often were those pegs twisted and re-twisted before our friend\r\nfound that he had twisted them enough; how many discordant scrapes\r\ngave promise of the coming harmony.  How much the muslin fluttered\r\nand crumpled before Eleanor and another nymph were duly seated at the\r\npiano; how closely did that tall Apollo pack himself against the wall,\r\nwith his flute, long as himself, extending high over the heads of his\r\npretty neighbours; into how small a corner crept that round and florid\r\nlittle minor canon, and there with skill amazing found room to tune\r\nhis accustomed fiddle!\r\n\r\nAnd now the crash begins: away they go in full flow of harmony\r\ntogether,--up hill and down dale,--now louder and louder, then\r\nlower and lower; now loud, as though stirring the battle; then low,\r\nas though mourning the slain.  In all, through all, and above all,\r\nis heard the violoncello.  Ah, not for nothing were those pegs so\r\ntwisted and re-twisted;--listen, listen!  Now alone that saddest\r\nof instruments tells its touching tale.  Silent, and in awe, stand\r\nfiddle, flute, and piano, to hear the sorrows of their wailing\r\nbrother.  \'Tis but for a moment: before the melancholy of those low\r\nnotes has been fully realised, again comes the full force of all the\r\nband;--down go the pedals, away rush twenty fingers scouring over the\r\nbass notes with all the impetus of passion.  Apollo blows till his\r\nstiff neckcloth is no better than a rope, and the minor canon works\r\nwith both arms till he falls in a syncope of exhaustion against the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nHow comes it that now, when all should be silent, when courtesy, if\r\nnot taste, should make men listen,--how is it at this moment the\r\nblack-coated corps leave their retreat and begin skirmishing?  One by\r\none they creep forth, and fire off little guns timidly, and without\r\nprecision.  Ah, my men, efforts such as these will take no cities,\r\neven though the enemy should be never so open to assault.  At length a\r\nmore deadly artillery is brought to bear; slowly, but with effect, the\r\nadvance is made; the muslin ranks are broken, and fall into confusion;\r\nthe formidable array of chairs gives way; the battle is no longer\r\nbetween opposing regiments, but hand to hand, and foot to foot with\r\nsingle combatants, as in the glorious days of old, when fighting was\r\nreally noble.  In corners, and under the shadow of curtains, behind\r\nsofas and half hidden by doors, in retiring windows, and sheltered\r\nby hanging tapestry, are blows given and returned, fatal, incurable,\r\ndealing death.\r\n\r\nApart from this another combat arises, more sober and more serious.\r\nThe archdeacon is engaged against two prebendaries, a pursy full-blown\r\nrector assisting him, in all the perils and all the enjoyments of\r\nshort whist.  With solemn energy do they watch the shuffled pack, and,\r\nall-expectant, eye the coming trump.  With what anxious nicety do they\r\narrange their cards, jealous of each other\'s eyes!  Why is that lean\r\ndoctor so slow,--cadaverous man with hollow jaw and sunken eye, ill\r\nbeseeming the richness of his mother church!  Ah, why so slow, thou\r\nmeagre doctor?  See how the archdeacon, speechless in his agony,\r\ndeposits on the board his cards, and looks to heaven or to the ceiling\r\nfor support.  Hark, how he sighs, as with thumbs in his waistcoat\r\npocket he seems to signify that the end of such torment is not yet\r\neven nigh at hand!  Vain is the hope, if hope there be, to disturb\r\nthat meagre doctor.  With care precise he places every card,\r\nweighs well the value of each mighty ace, each guarded king, and\r\ncomfort-giving queen; speculates on knave and ten, counts all his\r\nsuits, and sets his price upon the whole.  At length a card is led,\r\nand quick three others fall upon the board.  The little doctor leads\r\nagain, while with lustrous eye his partner absorbs the trick.  Now\r\nthrice has this been done,--thrice has constant fortune favoured\r\nthe brace of prebendaries, ere the archdeacon rouses himself to the\r\nbattle; but at the fourth assault he pins to the earth a prostrate\r\nking, laying low his crown and sceptre, bushy beard, and lowering\r\nbrow, with a poor deuce.\r\n\r\n"As David did Goliath," says the archdeacon, pushing over the four\r\ncards to his partner.  And then a trump is led, then another trump;\r\nthen a king,--and then an ace,--and then a long ten, which brings\r\ndown from the meagre doctor his only remaining tower of strength--his\r\ncherished queen of trumps.\r\n\r\n"What, no second club?" says the archdeacon to his partner.\r\n\r\n"Only one club," mutters from his inmost stomach the pursy rector, who\r\nsits there red-faced, silent, impervious, careful, a safe but not a\r\nbrilliant ally.\r\n\r\nBut the archdeacon cares not for many clubs, or for none.  He dashes\r\nout his remaining cards with a speed most annoying to his antagonists,\r\npushes over to them some four cards as their allotted portion, shoves\r\nthe remainder across the table to the red-faced rector; calls out "two\r\nby cards and two by honours, and the odd trick last time," marks a\r\ntreble under the candle-stick, and has dealt round the second pack\r\nbefore the meagre doctor has calculated his losses.\r\n\r\nAnd so went off the warden\'s party, and men and women arranging shawls\r\nand shoes declared how pleasant it had been; and Mrs Goodenough, the\r\nred-faced rector\'s wife, pressing the warden\'s hand, declared she had\r\nnever enjoyed herself better; which showed how little pleasure she\r\nallowed herself in this world, as she had sat the whole evening\r\nthrough in the same chair without occupation, not speaking, and\r\nunspoken to.  And Matilda Johnson, when she allowed young Dickson of\r\nthe bank to fasten her cloak round her neck, thought that two hundred\r\npounds a year and a little cottage would really do for happiness;\r\nbesides, he was sure to be manager some day.  And Apollo, folding his\r\nflute into his pocket, felt that he had acquitted himself with honour;\r\nand the archdeacon pleasantly jingled his gains; but the meagre doctor\r\nwent off without much audible speech, muttering ever and anon as he\r\nwent, "three and thirty points!" "three and thirty points!"\r\n\r\nAnd so they all were gone, and Mr Harding was left alone with his\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nWhat had passed between Eleanor Harding and Mary Bold need not\r\nbe told.  It is indeed a matter of thankfulness that neither the\r\nhistorian nor the novelist hears all that is said by their heroes\r\nor heroines, or how would three volumes or twenty suffice!  In the\r\npresent case so little of this sort have I overheard, that I live\r\nin hopes of finishing my work within 300 pages, and of completing\r\nthat pleasant task--a novel in one volume; but something had passed\r\nbetween them, and as the warden blew out the wax candles, and put his\r\ninstrument into its case, his daughter stood sad and thoughtful by the\r\nempty fire-place, determined to speak to her father, but irresolute as\r\nto what she would say.\r\n\r\n"Well, Eleanor," said he, "are you for bed?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said she, moving, "I suppose so; but papa--Mr Bold was not here\r\ntonight; do you know why not?"\r\n\r\n"He was asked; I wrote to him myself," said the warden.\r\n\r\n"But do you know why he did not come, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Well, Eleanor, I could guess; but it\'s no use guessing at such\r\nthings, my dear.  What makes you look so earnest about it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa, do tell me," she exclaimed, throwing her arms round him,\r\nand looking into his face; "what is it he is going to do?  What is it\r\nall about?  Is there any--any--any--" she didn\'t well know what word\r\nto use--"any danger?"\r\n\r\n"Danger, my dear, what sort of danger?"\r\n\r\n"Danger to you, danger of trouble, and of loss, and of--Oh, papa, why\r\nhaven\'t you told me of all this before?"\r\n\r\nMr Harding was not the man to judge harshly of anyone, much less of\r\nthe daughter whom he now loved better than any living creature; but\r\nstill he did judge her wrongly at this moment.  He knew that she loved\r\nJohn Bold; he fully sympathised in her affection; day after day he\r\nthought more of the matter, and, with the tender care of a loving\r\nfather, tried to arrange in his own mind how matters might be so\r\nmanaged that his daughter\'s heart should not be made the sacrifice to\r\nthe dispute which was likely to exist between him and Bold.  Now, when\r\nshe spoke to him for the first time on the subject, it was natural\r\nthat he should think more of her than of himself, and that he should\r\nimagine that her own cares, and not his, were troubling her.\r\n\r\nHe stood silent before her awhile, as she gazed up into his face, and\r\nthen kissing her forehead he placed her on the sofa.\r\n\r\n"Tell me, Nelly," he said (he only called her Nelly in his kindest,\r\nsoftest, sweetest moods, and yet all his moods were kind and sweet),\r\n"tell me, Nelly, do you like Mr Bold--much?"\r\n\r\nShe was quite taken aback by the question.  I will not say that she\r\nhad forgotten herself, and her own love in thinking about John Bold,\r\nand while conversing with Mary: she certainly had not done so.  She\r\nhad been sick at heart to think that a man of whom she could not but\r\nown to herself that she loved him, of whose regard she had been so\r\nproud, that such a man should turn against her father to ruin him.\r\nShe had felt her vanity hurt, that his affection for her had not kept\r\nhim from such a course; had he really cared for her, he would not have\r\nrisked her love by such an outrage.  But her main fear had been for\r\nher father, and when she spoke of danger, it was of danger to him and\r\nnot to herself.\r\n\r\nShe was taken aback by the question altogether: "Do I like him, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Nelly, do you like him?  Why shouldn\'t you like him? but that\'s\r\na poor word;--do you love him?"  She sat still in his arms without\r\nanswering him.  She certainly had not prepared herself for an avowal\r\nof affection, intending, as she had done, to abuse John Bold herself,\r\nand to hear her father do so also.  "Come, my love," said he, "let us\r\nmake a clean breast of it: do you tell me what concerns yourself, and\r\nI will tell you what concerns me and the hospital."\r\n\r\nAnd then, without waiting for an answer, he described to her, as he\r\nbest could, the accusation that was made about Hiram\'s will; the\r\nclaims which the old men put forward; what he considered the strength\r\nand what the weakness of his own position; the course which Bold had\r\ntaken, and that which he presumed he was about to take; and then\r\nby degrees, without further question, he presumed on the fact of\r\nEleanor\'s love, and spoke of that love as a feeling which he could in\r\nno way disapprove: he apologised for Bold, excused what he was doing;\r\nnay, praised him for his energy and intentions; made much of his good\r\nqualities, and harped on none of his foibles; then, reminding his\r\ndaughter how late it was, and comforting her with much assurance which\r\nhe hardly felt himself, he sent her to her room, with flowing eyes and\r\na full heart.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Harding met his daughter at breakfast the next morning, there\r\nwas no further discussion on the matter, nor was the subject mentioned\r\nbetween them for some days.  Soon after the party Mary Bold called at\r\nthe hospital, but there were various persons in the drawing-room at\r\nthe time, and she therefore said nothing about her brother.  On the\r\nday following, John Bold met Miss Harding in one of the quiet, sombre,\r\nshaded walks of the close.  He was most anxious to see her, but\r\nunwilling to call at the warden\'s house, and had in truth waylaid her\r\nin her private haunts.\r\n\r\n"My sister tells me," said he, abruptly hurrying on with his\r\npremeditated speech, "my sister tells me that you had a delightful\r\nparty the other evening.  I was so sorry I could not be there."\r\n\r\n"We were all sorry," said Eleanor, with dignified composure.\r\n\r\n"I believe, Miss Harding, you understand why, at this moment--"  And\r\nBold hesitated, muttered, stopped, commenced his explanation again,\r\nand again broke down.\r\n\r\nEleanor would not help him in the least.\r\n\r\n"I think my sister explained to you, Miss Harding?"\r\n\r\n"Pray don\'t apologise, Mr Bold; my father will, I am sure, always be\r\nglad to see you, if you like to come to the house now as formerly;\r\nnothing has occurred to alter his feelings: of your own views you are,\r\nof course, the best judge."\r\n\r\n"Your father is all that is kind and generous; he always was so; but\r\nyou, Miss Harding, yourself--I hope you will not judge me harshly,\r\nbecause--"\r\n\r\n"Mr Bold," said she, "you may be sure of one thing; I shall always\r\njudge my father to be right, and those who oppose him I shall judge\r\nto be wrong.  If those who do not know him oppose him, I shall have\r\ncharity enough to believe that they are wrong, through error of\r\njudgment; but should I see him attacked by those who ought to know\r\nhim, and to love him, and revere him, of such I shall be constrained\r\nto form a different opinion."  And then curtseying low she sailed on,\r\nleaving her lover in anything but a happy state of mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\n\r\n_THE JUPITER_\r\n\r\n\r\nThough Eleanor Harding rode off from John Bold on a high horse, it\r\nmust not be supposed that her heart was so elate as her demeanour.\r\nIn the first place, she had a natural repugnance to losing her\r\nlover; and in the next, she was not quite so sure that she was in\r\nthe right as she pretended to be.  Her father had told her, and that\r\nnow repeatedly, that Bold was doing nothing unjust or ungenerous;\r\nand why then should she rebuke him, and throw him off, when she felt\r\nherself so ill able to bear his loss?--but such is human nature, and\r\nyoung-lady-nature especially.\r\n\r\nAs she walked off from him beneath the shady elms of the close, her\r\nlook, her tone, every motion and gesture of her body, belied her\r\nheart; she would have given the world to have taken him by the hand,\r\nto have reasoned with him, persuaded him, cajoled him, coaxed him out\r\nof his project; to have overcome him with all her female artillery,\r\nand to have redeemed her father at the cost of herself; but pride\r\nwould not let her do this, and she left him without a look of love or\r\na word of kindness.\r\n\r\nHad Bold been judging of another lover and of another lady, he might\r\nhave understood all this as well as we do; but in matters of love men\r\ndo not see clearly in their own affairs.  They say that faint heart\r\nnever won fair lady; and it is amazing to me how fair ladies are\r\nwon, so faint are often men\'s hearts!  Were it not for the kindness\r\nof their nature, that seeing the weakness of our courage they will\r\noccasionally descend from their impregnable fortresses, and themselves\r\naid us in effecting their own defeat, too often would they escape\r\nunconquered if not unscathed, and free of body if not of heart.\r\n\r\nPoor Bold crept off quite crestfallen; he felt that as regarded\r\nEleanor Harding his fate was sealed, unless he could consent to give\r\nup a task to which he had pledged himself, and which indeed it would\r\nnot be easy for him to give up.  Lawyers were engaged, and the\r\nquestion had to a certain extent been taken up by the public; besides,\r\nhow could a high-spirited girl like Eleanor Harding really learn to\r\nlove a man for neglecting a duty which he assumed!  Could she allow\r\nher affection to be purchased at the cost of his own self-respect?\r\n\r\nAs regarded the issue of his attempt at reformation in the hospital,\r\nBold had no reason hitherto to be discontented with his success.\r\nAll Barchester was by the ears about it.  The bishop, the archdeacon,\r\nthe warden, the steward, and several other clerical allies, had daily\r\nmeetings, discussing their tactics, and preparing for the great\r\nattack.  Sir Abraham Haphazard had been consulted, but his opinion was\r\nnot yet received: copies of Hiram\'s will, copies of wardens\' journals,\r\ncopies of leases, copies of accounts, copies of everything that could\r\nbe copied, and of some that could not, had been sent to him; and the\r\ncase was assuming most creditable dimensions.  But, above all, it had\r\nbeen mentioned in the daily _Jupiter_.  That all-powerful organ of\r\nthe press in one of its leading thunderbolts launched at St Cross, had\r\nthus remarked: "Another case, of smaller dimensions indeed, but of\r\nsimilar import, is now likely to come under public notice.  We are\r\ninformed that the warden or master of an old almshouse attached to\r\nBarchester Cathedral is in receipt of twenty-five times the annual\r\nincome appointed for him by the will of the founder, while the sum\r\nyearly expended on the absolute purposes of the charity has always\r\nremained fixed.  In other words, the legatees under the founder\'s\r\nwill have received no advantage from the increase in the value of the\r\nproperty during the last four centuries, such increase having been\r\nabsorbed by the so-called warden.  It is impossible to conceive a\r\ncase of greater injustice.  It is no answer to say that some six or\r\nnine or twelve old men receive as much of the goods of this world\r\nas such old men require.  On what foundation, moral or divine,\r\ntraditional or legal, is grounded the warden\'s claim to the large\r\nincome he receives for doing nothing?  The contentment of these\r\nalmsmen, if content they be, can give him no title to this wealth!\r\nDoes he ever ask himself, when he stretches wide his clerical palm to\r\nreceive the pay of some dozen of the working clergy, for what service\r\nhe is so remunerated?  Does his conscience ever entertain the question\r\nof his right to such subsidies?  Or is it possible that the subject\r\nnever so presents itself to his mind; that he has received for many\r\nyears, and intends, should God spare him, to receive for years to come\r\nthese fruits of the industrious piety of past ages, indifferent as to\r\nany right on his own part, or of any injustice to others!  We must\r\nexpress an opinion that nowhere but in the Church of England, and only\r\nthere among its priests, could such a state of moral indifference be\r\nfound."\r\n\r\nI must for the present leave my readers to imagine the state of Mr\r\nHarding\'s mind after reading the above article.  They say that forty\r\nthousand copies of _The Jupiter_ are daily sold, and that each copy is\r\nread by five persons at the least.  Two hundred thousand readers then\r\nwould hear this accusation against him; two hundred thousand hearts\r\nwould swell with indignation at the griping injustice, the barefaced\r\nrobbery of the warden of Barchester Hospital!  And how was he to\r\nanswer this?  How was he to open his inmost heart to this multitude,\r\nto these thousands, the educated, the polished, the picked men of his\r\nown country; how show them that he was no robber, no avaricious, lazy\r\npriest scrambling for gold, but a retiring, humble-spirited man, who\r\nhad innocently taken what had innocently been offered to him?\r\n\r\n"Write to _The Jupiter_," suggested the bishop.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the archdeacon, more worldly wise than his father, "yes,\r\nand be smothered with ridicule; tossed over and over again with\r\nscorn; shaken this way and that, as a rat in the mouth of a practised\r\nterrier.  You will leave out some word or letter in your answer, and\r\nthe ignorance of the cathedral clergy will be harped upon; you will\r\nmake some small mistake, which will be a falsehood, or some admission,\r\nwhich will be self-condemnation; you will find yourself to have been\r\nvulgar, ill-tempered, irreverend, and illiterate, and the chances are\r\nten to one, but that being a clergyman, you will have been guilty of\r\nblasphemy!  A man may have the best of causes, the best of talents,\r\nand the best of tempers; he may write as well as Addison, or as\r\nstrongly as Junius; but even with all this he cannot successfully\r\nanswer, when attacked by _The Jupiter_.  In such matters it is\r\nomnipotent.  What the Czar is in Russia, or the mob in America, that\r\n_The Jupiter_ is in England.  Answer such an article!  No, warden;\r\nwhatever you do, don\'t do that.  We were to look for this sort of\r\nthing, you know; but we need not draw down on our heads more of it\r\nthan is necessary."\r\n\r\nThe article in _The Jupiter_, while it so greatly harassed our poor\r\nwarden, was an immense triumph to some of the opposite party.  Sorry\r\nas Bold was to see Mr Harding attacked so personally, it still gave\r\nhim a feeling of elation to find his cause taken up by so powerful\r\nan advocate: and as to Finney, the attorney, he was beside himself.\r\nWhat! to be engaged in the same cause and on the same side with\r\n_The Jupiter_; to have the views he had recommended seconded, and\r\nfurthered, and battled for by _The Jupiter_!  Perhaps to have his own\r\nname mentioned as that of the learned gentleman whose efforts had\r\nbeen so successful on behalf of the poor of Barchester!  He might be\r\nexamined before committees of the House of Commons, with heaven knows\r\nhow much a day for his personal expenses;--he might be engaged for\r\nyears on such a suit!  There was no end to the glorious golden dreams\r\nwhich this leader in _The Jupiter_ produced in the soaring mind of\r\nFinney.\r\n\r\nAnd the old bedesmen, they also heard of this article, and had a\r\nglimmering, indistinct idea of the marvellous advocate which had now\r\ntaken up their cause.  Abel Handy limped hither and thither through\r\nthe rooms, repeating all that he understood to have been printed,\r\nwith some additions of his own which he thought should have been\r\nadded.  He told them how _The Jupiter_ had declared that their warden\r\nwas no better than a robber, and that what _The Jupiter_ said was\r\nacknowledged by the world to be true.  How _The Jupiter_ had affirmed\r\nthat each one of them--"each one of us, Jonathan Crumple, think of\r\nthat!"--had a clear right to a hundred a year; and that if _The\r\nJupiter_ had said so, it was better than a decision of the Lord\r\nChancellor: and then he carried about the paper, supplied by Mr\r\nFinney, which, though none of them could read it, still afforded in\r\nits very touch and aspect positive corroboration of what was told\r\nthem; and Jonathan Crumple pondered deeply over his returning wealth;\r\nand Job Skulpit saw how right he had been in signing the petition, and\r\nsaid so many scores of times; and Spriggs leered fearfully with his\r\none eye; and Moody, as he more nearly approached the coming golden\r\nage, hated more deeply than ever those who still kept possession of\r\nwhat he so coveted.  Even Billy Gazy and poor bed-ridden Bell became\r\nactive and uneasy, and the great Bunce stood apart with lowering brow,\r\nwith deep grief seated in his heart, for he perceived that evil days\r\nwere coming.\r\n\r\nIt had been decided, the archdeacon advising, that no remonstrance,\r\nexplanation, or defence should be addressed from the Barchester\r\nconclave to the editor of _The Jupiter_; but hitherto that was the\r\nonly decision to which they had come.\r\n\r\nSir Abraham Haphazard was deeply engaged in preparing a bill for the\r\nmortification of papists, to be called the "Convent Custody Bill,"\r\nthe purport of which was to enable any Protestant clergyman over\r\nfifty years of age to search any nun whom he suspected of being in\r\npossession of treasonable papers or Jesuitical symbols; and as there\r\nwere to be a hundred and thirty-seven clauses in the bill, each clause\r\ncontaining a separate thorn for the side of the papist, and as it\r\nwas known the bill would be fought inch by inch, by fifty maddened\r\nIrishmen, the due construction and adequate dovetailing of it did\r\nconsume much of Sir Abraham\'s time.  The bill had all its desired\r\neffect.  Of course it never passed into law; but it so completely\r\ndivided the ranks of the Irish members, who had bound themselves\r\ntogether to force on the ministry a bill for compelling all men to\r\ndrink Irish whiskey, and all women to wear Irish poplins, that for\r\nthe remainder of the session the Great Poplin and Whiskey League was\r\nutterly harmless.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that Sir Abraham\'s opinion was not at once\r\nforthcoming, and the uncertainty, the expectation, and suffering of\r\nthe folk of Barchester was maintained at a high pitch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII\r\n\r\nPLUMSTEAD EPISCOPI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader must now be requested to visit the rectory of Plumstead\r\nEpiscopi; and as it is as yet still early morning, to ascend again\r\nwith us into the bedroom of the archdeacon.  The mistress of the\r\nmansion was at her toilet; on which we will not dwell with profane\r\neyes, but proceed into a small inner room, where the doctor dressed\r\nand kept his boots and sermons; and here we will take our stand,\r\npremising that the door of the room was so open as to admit of a\r\nconversation between our reverend Adam and his valued Eve.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all your own fault, archdeacon," said the latter.  "I told you\r\nfrom the beginning how it would end, and papa has no one to thank but\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Good gracious, my dear," said the doctor, appearing at the door of\r\nhis dressing-room, with his face and head enveloped in the rough towel\r\nwhich he was violently using; "how can you say so?  I am doing my very\r\nbest."\r\n\r\n"I wish you had never done so much," said the lady, interrupting him.\r\n"If you\'d just have let John Bold come and go there, as he and papa\r\nliked, he and Eleanor would have been married by this time, and we\r\nshould not have heard one word about all this affair."\r\n\r\n"But, my dear--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s all very well, archdeacon; and of course you\'re right; I\r\ndon\'t for a moment think you\'ll ever admit that you could be wrong;\r\nbut the fact is, you\'ve brought this young man down upon papa by\r\nhuffing him as you have done."\r\n\r\n"But, my love--"\r\n\r\n"And all because you didn\'t like John Bold for a brother-in-law.\r\nHow is she ever to do better?  Papa hasn\'t got a shilling; and though\r\nEleanor is well enough, she has not at all a taking style of beauty.\r\nI\'m sure I don\'t know how she\'s to do better than marry John Bold; or\r\nas well indeed," added the anxious sister, giving the last twist to\r\nher last shoe-string.\r\n\r\nDr Grantly felt keenly the injustice of this attack; but what could he\r\nsay?  He certainly had huffed John Bold; he certainly had objected to\r\nhim as a brother-in-law, and a very few months ago the very idea had\r\nexcited his wrath: but now matters were changed; John Bold had shown\r\nhis power, and, though he was as odious as ever to the archdeacon,\r\npower is always respected, and the reverend dignitary began to think\r\nthat such an alliance might not have been imprudent.  Nevertheless,\r\nhis motto was still "no surrender;" he would still fight it out;\r\nhe believed confidently in Oxford, in the bench of bishops, in Sir\r\nAbraham Haphazard, and in himself; and it was only when alone with\r\nhis wife that doubts of defeat ever beset him.  He once more tried to\r\ncommunicate this confidence to Mrs Grantly, and for the twentieth time\r\nbegan to tell her of Sir Abraham.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Sir Abraham!" said she, collecting all her house keys into her\r\nbasket before she descended; "Sir Abraham won\'t get Eleanor a husband;\r\nSir Abraham won\'t get papa another income when he has been worreted\r\nout of the hospital.  Mark what I tell you, archdeacon: while you and\r\nSir Abraham are fighting, papa will lose his preferment; and what will\r\nyou do then with him and Eleanor on your hands? besides, who\'s to pay\r\nSir Abraham?  I suppose he won\'t take the case up for nothing?"  And\r\nso the lady descended to family worship among her children and\r\nservants, the pattern of a good and prudent wife.\r\n\r\nDr Grantly was blessed with a happy, thriving family.  There were,\r\nfirst, three boys, now at home from school for the holidays.  They\r\nwere called, respectively, Charles James, Henry, and Samuel.  The two\r\nyounger (there were five in all) were girls; the elder, Florinda, bore\r\nthe name of the Archbishop of York\'s wife, whose godchild she was:\r\nand the younger had been christened Grizzel, after a sister of the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury.  The boys were all clever, and gave good\r\npromise of being well able to meet the cares and trials of the world;\r\nand yet they were not alike in their dispositions, and each had his\r\nindividual character, and each his separate admirers among the\r\ndoctor\'s friends.\r\n\r\nCharles James was an exact and careful boy; he never committed\r\nhimself; he well knew how much was expected from the eldest son of the\r\nArchdeacon of Barchester, and was therefore mindful not to mix too\r\nfreely with other boys.  He had not the great talents of his younger\r\nbrothers, but he exceeded them in judgment and propriety of demeanour;\r\nhis fault, if he had one, was an over-attention to words instead of\r\nthings; there was a thought too much finesse about him, and, as even\r\nhis father sometimes told him, he was too fond of a compromise.\r\n\r\nThe second was the archdeacon\'s favourite son, and Henry was indeed a\r\nbrilliant boy.  The versatility of his genius was surprising, and the\r\nvisitors at Plumstead Episcopi were often amazed at the marvellous\r\nmanner in which he would, when called on, adapt his capacity to\r\napparently most uncongenial pursuits.  He appeared once before a large\r\ncircle as Luther the reformer, and delighted them with the perfect\r\nmanner in which he assumed the character; and within three days he\r\nagain astonished them by acting the part of a Capuchin friar to the\r\nvery life.  For this last exploit his father gave him a golden guinea,\r\nand his brothers said the reward had been promised beforehand in the\r\nevent of the performance being successful.  He was also sent on a tour\r\ninto Devonshire; a treat which the lad was most anxious of enjoying.\r\nHis father\'s friends there, however, did not appreciate his talents,\r\nand sad accounts were sent home of the perversity of his nature.  He\r\nwas a most courageous lad, game to the backbone.\r\n\r\nIt was soon known, both at home, where he lived, and within some miles\r\nof Barchester Cathedral, and also at Westminster, where he was at\r\nschool, that young Henry could box well and would never own himself\r\nbeat; other boys would fight while they had a leg to stand on, but he\r\nwould fight with no leg at all.  Those backing him would sometimes\r\nthink him crushed by the weight of blows and faint with loss of blood,\r\nand his friends would endeavour to withdraw him from the contest; but\r\nno, Henry never gave in, was never weary of the battle.  The ring was\r\nthe only element in which he seemed to enjoy himself; and while other\r\nboys were happy in the number of their friends, he rejoiced most in\r\nthe multitude of his foes.\r\n\r\nHis relations could not but admire his pluck, but they sometimes were\r\nforced to regret that he was inclined to be a bully; and those not\r\nso partial to him as his father was, observed with pain that, though\r\nhe could fawn to the masters and the archdeacon\'s friends, he was\r\nimperious and masterful to the servants and the poor.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps Samuel was the general favourite; and dear little Soapy,\r\nas he was familiarly called, was as engaging a child as ever fond\r\nmother petted.  He was soft and gentle in his manners, and attractive\r\nin his speech; the tone of his voice was melody, and every action was\r\na grace; unlike his brothers, he was courteous to all, he was affable\r\nto the lowly, and meek even to the very scullery-maid.  He was a boy\r\nof great promise, minding his books and delighting the hearts of his\r\nmasters.  His brothers, however, were not particularly fond of him;\r\nthey would complain to their mother that Soapy\'s civility all meant\r\nsomething; they thought that his voice was too often listened to at\r\nPlumstead Episcopi, and evidently feared that, as he grew up, he\r\nwould have more weight in the house than either of them; there was,\r\ntherefore, a sort of agreement among them to put young Soapy down.\r\nThis, however, was not so easy to be done; Samuel, though young, was\r\nsharp; he could not assume the stiff decorum of Charles James, nor\r\ncould he fight like Henry; but he was a perfect master of his own\r\nweapons, and contrived, in the teeth of both of them, to hold the\r\nplace which he had assumed.  Henry declared that he was a false,\r\ncunning creature; and Charles James, though he always spoke of him as\r\nhis dear brother Samuel, was not slow to say a word against him when\r\nopportunity offered.  To speak the truth, Samuel was a cunning boy,\r\nand those even who loved him best could not but own that for one so\r\nyoung, he was too adroit in choosing his words, and too skilled in\r\nmodulating his voice.\r\n\r\nThe two little girls Florinda and Grizzel were nice little girls\r\nenough, but they did not possess the strong sterling qualities of\r\ntheir brothers; their voices were not often heard at Plumstead\r\nEpiscopi; they were bashful and timid by nature, slow to speak before\r\ncompany even when asked to do so; and though they looked very nice in\r\ntheir clean white muslin frocks and pink sashes, they were but little\r\nnoticed by the archdeacon\'s visitors.\r\n\r\nWhatever of submissive humility may have appeared in the gait and\r\nvisage of the archdeacon during his colloquy with his wife in the\r\nsanctum of their dressing-rooms was dispelled as he entered his\r\nbreakfast-parlour with erect head and powerful step.  In the presence\r\nof a third person he assumed the lord and master; and that wise and\r\ntalented lady too well knew the man to whom her lot for life was\r\nbound, to stretch her authority beyond the point at which it would be\r\nborne.  Strangers at Plumstead Episcopi, when they saw the imperious\r\nbrow with which he commanded silence from the large circle of\r\nvisitors, children, and servants who came together in the morning to\r\nhear him read the word of God, and watched how meekly that wife seated\r\nherself behind her basket of keys with a little girl on each side,\r\nas she caught that commanding glance; strangers, I say, seeing this,\r\ncould little guess that some fifteen minutes since she had stoutly\r\nheld her ground against him, hardly allowing him to open his mouth in\r\nhis own defence. But such is the tact and talent of women!\r\n\r\nAnd now let us observe the well-furnished breakfast-parlour at\r\nPlumstead Episcopi, and the comfortable air of all the belongings of\r\nthe rectory.  Comfortable they certainly were, but neither gorgeous\r\nnor even grand; indeed, considering the money that had been spent\r\nthere, the eye and taste might have been better served; there was an\r\nair of heaviness about the rooms which might have been avoided without\r\nany sacrifice of propriety; colours might have been better chosen and\r\nlights more perfectly diffused; but perhaps in doing so the thorough\r\nclerical aspect of the whole might have been somewhat marred; at any\r\nrate, it was not without ample consideration that those thick, dark,\r\ncostly carpets were put down; those embossed, but sombre papers hung\r\nup; those heavy curtains draped so as to half exclude the light of\r\nthe sun: nor were these old-fashioned chairs, bought at a price far\r\nexceeding that now given for more modern goods, without a purpose.\r\nThe breakfast-service on the table was equally costly and equally\r\nplain; the apparent object had been to spend money without obtaining\r\nbrilliancy or splendour.  The urn was of thick and solid silver, as\r\nwere also the tea-pot, coffee-pot, cream-ewer, and sugar-bowl; the\r\ncups were old, dim dragon china, worth about a pound a piece, but very\r\ndespicable in the eyes of the uninitiated.  The silver forks were so\r\nheavy as to be disagreeable to the hand, and the bread-basket was of a\r\nweight really formidable to any but robust persons.  The tea consumed\r\nwas the very best, the coffee the very blackest, the cream the\r\nvery thickest; there was dry toast and buttered toast, muffins and\r\ncrumpets; hot bread and cold bread, white bread and brown bread,\r\nhome-made bread and bakers\' bread, wheaten bread and oaten bread; and\r\nif there be other breads than these, they were there; there were eggs\r\nin napkins, and crispy bits of bacon under silver covers; and there\r\nwere little fishes in a little box, and devilled kidneys frizzling on\r\na hot-water dish; which, by the bye, were placed closely contiguous to\r\nthe plate of the worthy archdeacon himself.  Over and above this, on\r\na snow-white napkin, spread upon the sideboard, was a huge ham and a\r\nhuge sirloin; the latter having laden the dinner table on the previous\r\nevening.  Such was the ordinary fare at Plumstead Episcopi.\r\n\r\nAnd yet I have never found the rectory a pleasant house.  The\r\nfact that man shall not live by bread alone seemed to be somewhat\r\nforgotten; and noble as was the appearance of the host, and sweet and\r\ngood-natured as was the face of the hostess, talented as were the\r\nchildren, and excellent as were the viands and the wines, in spite\r\nof these attractions, I generally found the rectory somewhat dull.\r\nAfter breakfast the archdeacon would retire, of course to his clerical\r\npursuits.  Mrs Grantly, I presume, inspected her kitchen, though she\r\nhad a first-rate housekeeper, with sixty pounds a year; and attended\r\nto the lessons of Florinda and Grizzel, though she had an excellent\r\ngoverness with thirty pounds a year: but at any rate she disappeared:\r\nand I never could make companions of the boys.  Charles James, though\r\nhe always looked as though there was something in him, never seemed to\r\nhave much to say; and what he did say he would always unsay the next\r\nminute.  He told me once that he considered cricket, on the whole, to\r\nbe a gentleman-like game for boys, provided they would play without\r\nrunning about; and that fives, also, was a seemly game, so that those\r\nwho played it never heated themselves.  Henry once quarrelled with me\r\nfor taking his sister Grizzel\'s part in a contest between them as to\r\nthe best mode of using a watering-pot for the garden flowers; and from\r\nthat day to this he has not spoken to me, though he speaks at me often\r\nenough.  For half an hour or so I certainly did like Sammy\'s gentle\r\nspeeches; but one gets tired of honey, and I found that he preferred\r\nthe more admiring listeners whom he met in the kitchen-garden and back\r\nprecincts of the establishment; besides, I think I once caught Sammy\r\nfibbing.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, therefore, I found the rectory a dull house, though it\r\nmust be admitted that everything there was of the very best.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, on the morning of which we are writing, the\r\narchdeacon, as usual, retired to his study, intimating that he was\r\ngoing to be very busy, but that he would see Mr Chadwick if he called.\r\nOn entering this sacred room he carefully opened the paper case on\r\nwhich he was wont to compose his favourite sermons, and spread on it\r\na fair sheet of paper and one partly written on; he then placed his\r\ninkstand, looked at his pen, and folded his blotting paper; having\r\ndone so, he got up again from his seat, stood with his back to the\r\nfire-place, and yawned comfortably, stretching out vastly his huge\r\narms and opening his burly chest.  He then walked across the room and\r\nlocked the door; and having so prepared himself, he threw himself into\r\nhis easy-chair, took from a secret drawer beneath his table a volume\r\nof Rabelais, and began to amuse himself with the witty mischief of\r\nPanurge; and so passed the archdeacon\'s morning on that day.\r\n\r\nHe was left undisturbed at his studies for an hour or two, when a\r\nknock came to the door, and Mr Chadwick was announced.  Rabelais\r\nretired into the secret drawer, the easy-chair seemed knowingly to\r\nbetake itself off, and when the archdeacon quickly undid his bolt,\r\nhe was discovered by the steward working, as usual, for that church\r\nof which he was so useful a pillar.  Mr Chadwick had just come from\r\nLondon, and was, therefore, known to be the bearer of important news.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got Sir Abraham\'s opinion at last," said Mr Chadwick, as he\r\nseated himself.\r\n\r\n"Well, well, well!" exclaimed the archdeacon impatiently.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s as long as my arm," said the other; "it can\'t be told in a\r\nword, but you can read it;" and he handed him a copy, in heaven knows\r\nhow many spun-out folios, of the opinion which the attorney-general\r\nhad managed to cram on the back and sides of the case as originally\r\nsubmitted to him.\r\n\r\n"The upshot is," said Chadwick, "that there\'s a screw loose in their\r\ncase, and we had better do nothing.  They are proceeding against Mr\r\nHarding and myself, and Sir Abraham holds that, under the wording of\r\nthe will, and subsequent arrangements legally sanctioned, Mr Harding\r\nand I are only paid servants.  The defendants should have been either\r\nthe Corporation of Barchester, or possibly the chapter of your\r\nfather."\r\n\r\n"W-hoo!" said the archdeacon; "so Master Bold is on the wrong scent,\r\nis he?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s Sir Abraham\'s opinion; but any scent almost would be a wrong\r\nscent.  Sir Abraham thinks that if they\'d taken the corporation, or\r\nthe chapter, we could have baffled them.  The bishop, he thinks, would\r\nbe the surest shot; but even there we could plead that the bishop is\r\nonly a visitor, and that he has never made himself a consenting party\r\nto the performance of other duties."\r\n\r\n"That\'s quite clear," said the archdeacon.\r\n\r\n"Not quite so clear," said the other.  "You see the will says, \'My\r\nlord, the bishop, being graciously pleased to see that due justice\r\nbe done.\'  Now, it may be a question whether, in accepting and\r\nadministering the patronage, your father has not accepted also the\r\nother duties assigned.  It is doubtful, however; but even if they hit\r\nthat nail,--and they are far off from that yet,--the point is so nice,\r\nas Sir Abraham says, that you would force them into fifteen thousand\r\npounds\' cost before they could bring it to an issue! and where\'s that\r\nsum of money to come from?"\r\n\r\nThe archdeacon rubbed his hands with delight; he had never doubted the\r\njustice of his case, but he had begun to have some dread of unjust\r\nsuccess on the part of his enemies.  It was delightful to him thus to\r\nhear that their cause was surrounded with such rocks and shoals; such\r\ncauses of shipwreck unseen by the landsman\'s eye, but visible enough\r\nto the keen eyes of practical law mariners.  How wrong his wife was to\r\nwish that Bold should marry Eleanor!  Bold! why, if he should be ass\r\nenough to persevere, he would be a beggar before he knew whom he was\r\nat law with!\r\n\r\n"That\'s excellent, Chadwick;--that\'s excellent!  I told you Sir\r\nAbraham was the man for us;" and he put down on the table the copy of\r\nthe opinion, and patted it fondly.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you let that be seen, though, archdeacon."\r\n\r\n"Who?--I!--not for worlds," said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"People will talk, you know, archdeacon."\r\n\r\n"Of course, of course," said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Because, if that gets abroad, it would teach them how to fight their\r\nown battle."\r\n\r\n"Quite true," said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"No one here in Barchester ought to see that but you and I,\r\narchdeacon."\r\n\r\n"No, no, certainly no one else," said the archdeacon, pleased with the\r\ncloseness of the confidence; "no one else shall."\r\n\r\n"Mrs Grantly is very interested in the matter, I know," said Mr\r\nChadwick.\r\n\r\nDid the archdeacon wink, or did he not?  I am inclined to think he did\r\nnot quite wink; but that without such, perhaps, unseemly gesture he\r\ncommunicated to Mr Chadwick, with the corner of his eye, intimation\r\nthat, deep as was Mrs Grantly\'s interest in the matter, it should not\r\nprocure for her a perusal of that document; and at the same time he\r\npartly opened the small drawer, above spoken of, deposited the paper\r\non the volume of Rabelais, and showed to Mr Chadwick the nature of the\r\nkey which guarded these hidden treasures.  The careful steward then\r\nexpressed himself contented.  Ah! vain man! he could fasten up his\r\nRabelais, and other things secret, with all the skill of Bramah or\r\nof Chubb; but where could he fasten up the key which solved these\r\nmechanical mysteries?  It is probable to us that the contents of\r\nno drawer in that house were unknown to its mistress, and we think,\r\nmoreover, that she was entitled to all such knowledge.\r\n\r\n"But," said Mr Chadwick, "we must, of course, tell your father and Mr\r\nHarding so much of Sir Abraham\'s opinion as will satisfy them that the\r\nmatter is doing well."\r\n\r\n"Oh, certainly,--yes, of course," said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"You had better let them know that Sir Abraham is of opinion that\r\nthere is no case at any rate against Mr Harding; and that as the\r\naction is worded at present, it must fall to the ground; they must be\r\nnonsuited, if they carry it on; you had better tell Mr Harding, that\r\nSir Abraham is clearly of opinion that he is only a servant, and as\r\nsuch not liable;--or if you like it, I\'ll see Mr Harding myself."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I must see him to-morrow, and my father too, and I\'ll explain to\r\nthem exactly so much;--you won\'t go before lunch, Mr Chadwick: well,\r\nif you will, you must, for I know your time is precious;" and he shook\r\nhands with the diocesan steward, and bowed him out.\r\n\r\nThe archdeacon had again recourse to his drawer, and twice read\r\nthrough the essence of Sir Abraham Haphazard\'s law-enlightened and\r\nlaw-bewildered brains.  It was very clear that to Sir Abraham, the\r\njustice of the old men\'s claim or the justice of Mr Harding\'s defence\r\nwere ideas that had never presented themselves.  A legal victory\r\nover an opposing party was the service for which Sir Abraham was, as\r\nhe imagined, to be paid; and that he, according to his lights, had\r\ndiligently laboured to achieve, and with probable hope of success.\r\nOf the intense desire which Mr Harding felt to be assured on fit\r\nauthority that he was wronging no man, that he was entitled in true\r\nequity to his income, that he might sleep at night without pangs of\r\nconscience, that he was no robber, no spoiler of the poor; that he and\r\nall the world might be openly convinced that he was not the man which\r\n_The Jupiter_ had described him to be; of such longings on the part of\r\nMr Harding, Sir Abraham was entirely ignorant; nor, indeed, could it\r\nbe looked on as part of his business to gratify such desires.  Such\r\nwas not the system on which his battles were fought, and victories\r\ngained.  Success was his object, and he was generally successful.\r\nHe conquered his enemies by their weakness rather than by his own\r\nstrength, and it had been found almost impossible to make up a case\r\nin which Sir Abraham, as an antagonist, would not find a flaw.\r\n\r\nThe archdeacon was delighted with the closeness of the reasoning.  To\r\ndo him justice, it was not a selfish triumph that he desired; he would\r\npersonally lose nothing by defeat, or at least what he might lose did\r\nnot actuate him; but neither was it love of justice which made him so\r\nanxious, nor even mainly solicitude for his father-in-law.  He was\r\nfighting a part of a never-ending battle against a never-conquered\r\nfoe--that of the church against its enemies.\r\n\r\nHe knew Mr Harding could not pay all the expense of these doings: for\r\nthese long opinions of Sir Abraham\'s, these causes to be pleaded,\r\nthese speeches to be made, these various courts through which the case\r\nwas, he presumed, to be dragged.  He knew that he and his father must\r\nat least bear the heavier portion of this tremendous cost; but to do\r\nthe archdeacon justice, he did not recoil from this.  He was a man\r\nfond of obtaining money, greedy of a large income, but open-handed\r\nenough in expending it, and it was a triumph to him to foresee the\r\nsuccess of this measure, although he might be called on to pay so\r\ndearly for it himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX\r\n\r\nTHE CONFERENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the archdeacon was with his father betimes,\r\nand a note was sent down to the warden begging his attendance at the\r\npalace.  Dr Grantly, as he cogitated on the matter, leaning back in\r\nhis brougham as he journeyed into Barchester, felt that it would be\r\ndifficult to communicate his own satisfaction either to his father or\r\nhis father-in-law.  He wanted success on his own side and discomfiture\r\non that of his enemies.  The bishop wanted peace on the subject; a\r\nsettled peace if possible, but peace at any rate till the short\r\nremainder of his own days had spun itself out.  Mr Harding required\r\nnot only success and peace, but he also demanded that he might stand\r\njustified before the world.\r\n\r\nThe bishop, however, was comparatively easy to deal with; and before\r\nthe arrival of the other, the dutiful son had persuaded his father\r\nthat all was going on well, and then the warden arrived.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr Harding\'s wont, whenever he spent a morning at the palace,\r\nto seat himself immediately at the bishop\'s elbow, the bishop\r\noccupying a huge arm-chair fitted up with candle-sticks, a reading\r\ntable, a drawer, and other paraphernalia, the position of which\r\nchair was never moved, summer or winter; and when, as was usual, the\r\narchdeacon was there also, he confronted the two elders, who thus were\r\nenabled to fight the battle against him together;--and together submit\r\nto defeat, for such was their constant fate.\r\n\r\nOur warden now took his accustomed place, having greeted his\r\nson-in-law as he entered, and then affectionately inquired after his\r\nfriend\'s health.  There was a gentleness about the bishop to which the\r\nsoft womanly affection of Mr Harding particularly endeared itself, and\r\nit was quaint to see how the two mild old priests pressed each other\'s\r\nhand, and smiled and made little signs of love.\r\n\r\n"Sir Abraham\'s opinion has come at last," began the archdeacon.  Mr\r\nHarding had heard so much, and was most anxious to know the result.\r\n\r\n"It is quite favourable," said the bishop, pressing his friend\'s arm.\r\n"I am so glad."\r\n\r\nMr Harding looked at the mighty bearer of the important news for\r\nconfirmation of these glad tidings.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the archdeacon; "Sir Abraham has given most minute\r\nattention to the case; indeed, I knew he would;--most minute\r\nattention; and his opinion is,--and as to his opinion on such a\r\nsubject being correct, no one who knows Sir Abraham\'s character can\r\ndoubt,--his opinion is, that they hav\'n\'t got a leg to stand on."\r\n\r\n"But as how, archdeacon?"\r\n\r\n"Why, in the first place:--but you\'re no lawyer, warden, and I doubt\r\nyou won\'t understand it; the gist of the matter is this:--under\r\nHiram\'s will two paid guardians have been selected for the hospital;\r\nthe law will say two paid servants, and you and I won\'t quarrel with\r\nthe name."\r\n\r\n"At any rate I will not if I am one of the servants," said Mr Harding.\r\n"A rose, you know--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," said the archdeacon, impatient of poetry at such a time.\r\n"Well, two paid servants, we\'ll say; one to look after the men, and\r\nthe other to look after the money.  You and Chadwick are these two\r\nservants, and whether either of you be paid too much, or too little,\r\nmore or less in fact than the founder willed, it\'s as clear as\r\ndaylight that no one can fall foul of either of you for receiving an\r\nallotted stipend."\r\n\r\n"That does seem clear," said the bishop, who had winced visibly at the\r\nwords servants and stipend, which, however, appeared to have caused no\r\nuneasiness to the archdeacon.\r\n\r\n"Quite clear," said he, "and very satisfactory.  In point of fact, it\r\nbeing necessary to select such servants for the use of the hospital,\r\nthe pay to be given to them must depend on the rate of pay for such\r\nservices, according to their market value at the period in question;\r\nand those who manage the hospital must be the only judges of this."\r\n\r\n"And who does manage the hospital?" asked the warden.\r\n\r\n"Oh, let them find that out; that\'s another question: the action is\r\nbrought against you and Chadwick; that\'s your defence, and a perfect and\r\nfull defence it is.  Now that I think very satisfactory."\r\n\r\n"Well," said the bishop, looking inquiringly up into his friend\'s\r\nface, who sat silent awhile, and apparently not so well satisfied.\r\n\r\n"And conclusive," continued the archdeacon; "if they press it to a\r\njury, which they won\'t do, no twelve men in England will take five\r\nminutes to decide against them."\r\n\r\n"But according to that," said Mr Harding, "I might as well have sixteen\r\nhundred a year as eight, if the managers choose to allot it to me; and\r\nas I am one of the managers, if not the chief manager, myself, that\r\ncan hardly be a just arrangement."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well; all that\'s nothing to the question.  The question is,\r\nwhether this intruding fellow, and a lot of cheating attorneys and\r\npestilent dissenters, are to interfere with an arrangement which\r\neveryone knows is essentially just and serviceable to the church.\r\nPray don\'t let us be splitting hairs, and that amongst ourselves, or\r\nthere\'ll never be an end of the cause or the cost."\r\n\r\nMr Harding again sat silent for a while, during which the bishop once\r\nand again pressed his arm, and looked in his face to see if he could\r\ncatch a gleam of a contented and eased mind; but there was no such\r\ngleam, and the poor warden continued playing sad dirges on invisible\r\nstringed instruments in all manner of positions; he was ruminating in\r\nhis mind on this opinion of Sir Abraham, looking to it wearily and\r\nearnestly for satisfaction, but finding none.  At last he said, "Did\r\nyou see the opinion, archdeacon?"\r\n\r\nThe archdeacon said he had not,--that was to say, he had,--that was,\r\nhe had not seen the opinion itself; he had seen what had been called a\r\ncopy, but he could not say whether of a whole or part; nor could he\r\nsay that what he had seen were the _ipsissima verba_ of the great man\r\nhimself; but what he had seen contained exactly the decision which he\r\nhad announced, and which he again declared to be to his mind extremely\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n"I should like to see the opinion," said the warden; "that is, a copy\r\nof it."\r\n\r\n"Well, I suppose you can if you make a point of it; but I don\'t see\r\nthe use myself; of course it is essential that the purport of it\r\nshould not be known, and it is therefore unadvisable to multiply\r\ncopies."\r\n\r\n"Why should it not be known?" asked the warden.\r\n\r\n"What a question for a man to ask!" said the archdeacon, throwing up\r\nhis hands in token of his surprise; "but it is like you:--a child is\r\nnot more innocent than you are in matters of business.  Can\'t you see\r\nthat if we tell them that no action will lie against you, but that one\r\nmay possibly lie against some other person or persons, that we shall\r\nbe putting weapons into their hands, and be teaching them how to cut\r\nour own throats?"\r\n\r\nThe warden again sat silent, and the bishop again looked at him\r\nwistfully.  "The only thing we have now to do," continued the\r\narchdeacon, "is to remain quiet, hold our peace, and let them play\r\ntheir own game as they please."\r\n\r\n"We are not to make known then," said the warden, "that we have\r\nconsulted the attorney-general, and that we are advised by him that\r\nthe founder\'s will is fully and fairly carried out."\r\n\r\n"God bless my soul!" said the archdeacon, "how odd it is that you will\r\nnot see that all we are to do is to do nothing: why should we say\r\nanything about the founder\'s will?  We are in possession; and we know\r\nthat they are not in a position to put us out; surely that is enough\r\nfor the present."\r\n\r\nMr Harding rose from his seat and paced thoughtfully up and down the\r\nlibrary, the bishop the while watching him painfully at every turn,\r\nand the archdeacon continuing to pour forth his convictions that the\r\naffair was in a state to satisfy any prudent mind.\r\n\r\n"And _The Jupiter_?" said the warden, stopping suddenly.\r\n\r\n"Oh! _The Jupiter_," answered the other.  "_The Jupiter_ can break no\r\nbones.  You must bear with that; there is much, of course, which it\r\nis our bounden duty to bear; it cannot be all roses for us here," and\r\nthe archdeacon looked exceedingly moral; "besides, the matter is too\r\ntrivial, of too little general interest to be mentioned again in _The\r\nJupiter_, unless we stir up the subject."  And the archdeacon again\r\nlooked exceedingly knowing and worldly wise.\r\n\r\nThe warden continued his walk; the hard and stinging words of that\r\nnewspaper article, each one of which had thrust a thorn as it were\r\ninto his inmost soul, were fresh in his memory; he had read it more\r\nthan once, word by word, and what was worse, he fancied it was as well\r\nknown to everyone as to himself.  Was he to be looked on as the unjust\r\ngriping priest he had been there described?  Was he to be pointed at\r\nas the consumer of the bread of the poor, and to be allowed no means\r\nof refuting such charges, of clearing his begrimed name, of standing\r\ninnocent in the world, as hitherto he had stood?  Was he to bear all\r\nthis, to receive as usual his now hated income, and be known as one\r\nof those greedy priests who by their rapacity have brought disgrace\r\non their church?  And why?  Why should he bear all this?  Why should\r\nhe die, for he felt that he could not live, under such a weight of\r\nobloquy?  As he paced up and down the room he resolved in his misery\r\nand enthusiasm that he could with pleasure, if he were allowed, give\r\nup his place, abandon his pleasant home, leave the hospital, and live\r\npoorly, happily, and with an unsullied name, on the small remainder of\r\nhis means.\r\n\r\nHe was a man somewhat shy of speaking of himself, even before those\r\nwho knew him best, and whom he loved the most; but at last it burst\r\nforth from him, and with a somewhat jerking eloquence he declared that\r\nhe could not, would not, bear this misery any longer.\r\n\r\n"If it can be proved," said he at last, "that I have a just and honest\r\nright to this, as God well knows I always deemed I had; if this salary\r\nor stipend be really my due, I am not less anxious than another to\r\nretain it.  I have the well-being of my child to look to.  I am too\r\nold to miss without some pain the comforts to which I have been used;\r\nand I am, as others are, anxious to prove to the world that I have\r\nbeen right, and to uphold the place I have held; but I cannot do it\r\nat such a cost as this.  I cannot bear this.  Could you tell me to do\r\nso?"  And he appealed, almost in tears, to the bishop, who had left\r\nhis chair, and was now leaning on the warden\'s arm as he stood on the\r\nfurther side of the table facing the archdeacon.  "Could you tell me\r\nto sit there at ease, indifferent, and satisfied, while such things as\r\nthese are said loudly of me in the world?"\r\n\r\nThe bishop could feel for him and sympathise with him, but he could\r\nnot advise him; he could only say, "No, no, you shall be asked to\r\ndo nothing that is painful; you shall do just what your heart tells\r\nyou to be right; you shall do whatever you think best yourself.\r\nTheophilus, don\'t advise him, pray don\'t advise the warden to do\r\nanything which is painful."\r\n\r\nBut the archdeacon, though he could not sympathise, could advise;\r\nand he saw that the time had come when it behoved him to do so in a\r\nsomewhat peremptory manner.\r\n\r\n"Why, my lord," he said, speaking to his father;--and when he called\r\nhis father "my lord," the good old bishop shook in his shoes, for he\r\nknew that an evil time was coming.  "Why, my lord, there are two ways\r\nof giving advice: there is advice that may be good for the present\r\nday; and there is advice that may be good for days to come: now I\r\ncannot bring myself to give the former, if it be incompatible with the\r\nother."\r\n\r\n"No, no, no, I suppose not," said the bishop, re-seating himself, and\r\nshading his face with his hands.  Mr Harding sat down with his back to\r\nthe further wall, playing to himself some air fitted for so calamitous\r\nan occasion, and the archdeacon said out his say standing, with his\r\nback to the empty fire-place.\r\n\r\n"It is not to be supposed but that much pain will spring out of this\r\nunnecessarily raised question.  We must all have foreseen that, and\r\nthe matter has in no wise gone on worse than we expected; but it will\r\nbe weak, yes, and wicked also, to abandon the cause and own ourselves\r\nwrong, because the inquiry is painful.  It is not only ourselves we\r\nhave to look to; to a certain extent the interest of the church is in\r\nour keeping.  Should it be found that one after another of those who\r\nhold preferment abandoned it whenever it might be attacked, is it\r\nnot plain that such attacks would be renewed till nothing was left\r\nus? and, that if so deserted, the Church of England must fall to\r\nthe ground altogether?  If this be true of many, it is true of one.\r\nWere you, accused as you now are, to throw up the wardenship, and to\r\nrelinquish the preferment which is your property, with the vain object\r\nof proving yourself disinterested, you would fail in that object, you\r\nwould inflict a desperate blow on your brother clergymen, you would\r\nencourage every cantankerous dissenter in England to make a similar\r\ncharge against some source of clerical revenue, and you would do your\r\nbest to dishearten those who are most anxious to defend you and uphold\r\nyour position.  I can fancy nothing more weak, or more wrong.  It is\r\nnot that you think that there is any justice in these charges, or that\r\nyou doubt your own right to the wardenship: you are convinced of your\r\nown honesty, and yet would yield to them through cowardice."\r\n\r\n"Cowardice!" said the bishop, expostulating.  Mr Harding sat unmoved,\r\ngazing on his son-in-law.\r\n\r\n"Well; would it not be cowardice?  Would he not do so because he is\r\nafraid to endure the evil things which will be falsely spoken of him?\r\nWould that not be cowardice?  And now let us see the extent of the\r\nevil which you dread.  The _Jupiter_ publishes an article which a\r\ngreat many, no doubt, will read; but of those who understand the\r\nsubject how many will believe _The Jupiter_?  Everyone knows what its\r\nobject is: it has taken up the case against Lord Guildford and against\r\nthe Dean of Rochester, and that against half a dozen bishops; and does\r\nnot everyone know that it would take up any case of the kind, right\r\nor wrong, false or true, with known justice or known injustice, if by\r\ndoing so it could further its own views?  Does not all the world know\r\nthis of _The Jupiter_?  Who that really knows you will think the worse\r\nof you for what _The Jupiter_ says?  And why care for those who do not\r\nknow you?  I will say nothing of your own comfort, but I do say that\r\nyou could not be justified in throwing up, in a fit of passion, for\r\nsuch it would be, the only maintenance that Eleanor has; and if you\r\ndid so, if you really did vacate the wardenship, and submit to ruin,\r\nwhat would that profit you?  If you have no future right to the\r\nincome, you have had no past right to it; and the very fact of your\r\nabandoning your position would create a demand for repayment of that\r\nwhich you have already received and spent."\r\n\r\nThe poor warden groaned as he sat perfectly still, looking up at the\r\nhard-hearted orator who thus tormented him, and the bishop echoed the\r\nsound faintly from behind his hands; but the archdeacon cared little\r\nfor such signs of weakness, and completed his exhortation.\r\n\r\n"But let us suppose the office to be left vacant, and that your own\r\ntroubles concerning it were over; would that satisfy you?  Are your\r\nonly aspirations in the matter confined to yourself and family?  I\r\nknow they are not.  I know you are as anxious as any of us for the\r\nchurch to which we belong; and what a grievous blow would such an act\r\nof apostasy give her!  You owe it to the church of which you are a\r\nmember and a minister, to bear with this affliction, however severe it\r\nmay be: you owe it to my father, who instituted you, to support his\r\nrights: you owe it to those who preceded you to assert the legality\r\nof their position; you owe it to those who are to come after you, to\r\nmaintain uninjured for them that which you received uninjured from\r\nothers; and you owe to us all the unflinching assistance of perfect\r\nbrotherhood in this matter, so that upholding one another we may\r\nsupport our great cause without blushing and without disgrace."\r\n\r\nAnd so the archdeacon ceased, and stood self-satisfied, watching the\r\neffect of his spoken wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe warden felt himself, to a certain extent, stifled; he would have\r\ngiven the world to get himself out into the open air without speaking\r\nto, or noticing those who were in the room with him; but this was\r\nimpossible.  He could not leave without saying something, and he felt\r\nhimself confounded by the archdeacon\'s eloquence.  There was a heavy,\r\nunfeeling, unanswerable truth in what he had said; there was so much\r\npractical, but odious common sense in it, that he neither knew how\r\nto assent or to differ.  If it were necessary for him to suffer, he\r\nfelt that he could endure without complaint and without cowardice,\r\nproviding that he was self-satisfied of the justice of his own cause.\r\nWhat he could not endure was, that he should be accused by others, and\r\nnot acquitted by himself.  Doubting, as he had begun to doubt, the\r\njustice of his own position in the hospital, he knew that his own\r\nself-confidence would not be restored because Mr Bold had been in\r\nerror as to some legal form; nor could he be satisfied to escape,\r\nbecause, through some legal fiction, he who received the greatest\r\nbenefit from the hospital might be considered only as one of its\r\nservants.\r\n\r\nThe archdeacon\'s speech had silenced him,--stupefied him,--annihilated\r\nhim; anything but satisfied him.  With the bishop it fared not much\r\nbetter.  He did not discern clearly how things were, but he saw enough\r\nto know that a battle was to be prepared for; a battle that would\r\ndestroy his few remaining comforts, and bring him with sorrow to the\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nThe warden still sat, and still looked at the archdeacon, till his\r\nthoughts fixed themselves wholly on the means of escape from his\r\npresent position, and he felt like a bird fascinated by gazing on a\r\nsnake.\r\n\r\n"I hope you agree with me," said the archdeacon at last, breaking the\r\ndread silence; "my lord, I hope you agree with me."\r\n\r\nOh, what a sigh the bishop gave!  "My lord, I hope you agree with me,"\r\nagain repeated the merciless tyrant.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I suppose so," groaned the poor old man, slowly.\r\n\r\n"And you, warden?"\r\n\r\nMr Harding was now stirred to action;--he must speak and move, so he\r\ngot up and took one turn before he answered.\r\n\r\n"Do not press me for an answer just at present; I will do nothing\r\nlightly in the matter, and of whatever I do I will give you and the\r\nbishop notice."  And so without another word he took his leave,\r\nescaping quickly through the palace hall, and down the lofty steps;\r\nnor did he breathe freely till he found himself alone under the huge\r\nelms of the silent close.  Here he walked long and slowly, thinking\r\non his case with a troubled air, and trying in vain to confute the\r\narchdeacon\'s argument.  He then went home, resolved to bear it\r\nall,--ignominy, suspense, disgrace, self-doubt, and heart-burning,--\r\nand to do as those would have him, who he still believed were most fit\r\nand most able to counsel him aright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X\r\n\r\nTRIBULATION\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Harding was a sadder man than he had ever yet been when he returned\r\nto his own house.  He had been wretched enough on that well-remembered\r\nmorning when he was forced to expose before his son-in-law the\r\npublisher\'s account for ushering into the world his dear book\r\nof sacred music: when after making such payments as he could do\r\nunassisted, he found that he was a debtor of more than three hundred\r\npounds; but his sufferings then were as nothing to his present\r\nmisery;--then he had done wrong, and he knew it, and was able to\r\nresolve that he would not sin in like manner again; but now he could\r\nmake no resolution, and comfort himself by no promises of firmness.\r\nHe had been forced to think that his lot had placed him in a false\r\nposition, and he was about to maintain that position against the\r\nopinion of the world and against his own convictions.\r\n\r\nHe had read with pity, amounting almost to horror, the strictures\r\nwhich had appeared from time to time against the Earl of Guildford as\r\nmaster of St Cross, and the invectives that had been heaped on rich\r\ndiocesan dignitaries and overgrown sinecure pluralists.  In judging of\r\nthem, he judged leniently; the whole bias of his profession had taught\r\nhim to think that they were more sinned against than sinning, and\r\nthat the animosity with which they had been pursued was venomous\r\nand unjust; but he had not the less regarded their plight as most\r\nmiserable.  His hair had stood on end and his flesh had crept as\r\nhe read the things which had been written; he had wondered how men\r\ncould live under such a load of disgrace; how they could face their\r\nfellow-creatures while their names were bandied about so injuriously\r\nand so publicly;--and now this lot was to be his,--he, that shy,\r\nretiring man, who had so comforted himself in the hidden obscurity of\r\nhis lot, who had so enjoyed the unassuming warmth of his own little\r\ncorner,--he was now dragged forth into the glaring day, and gibbeted\r\nbefore ferocious multitudes.  He entered his own house a crestfallen,\r\nhumiliated man, without a hope of overcoming the wretchedness which\r\naffected him.\r\n\r\nHe wandered into the drawing-room where was his daughter; but he could\r\nnot speak to her now, so he left it, and went into the book-room.\r\nHe was not quick enough to escape Eleanor\'s glance, or to prevent her\r\nfrom seeing that he was disturbed; and in a little while she followed\r\nhim.  She found him seated in his accustomed chair with no book open\r\nbefore him, no pen ready in his hand, no ill-shapen notes of blotted\r\nmusic lying before him as was usual, none of those hospital accounts\r\nwith which he was so precise and yet so unmethodical: he was doing\r\nnothing, thinking of nothing, looking at nothing; he was merely\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\n"Leave me, Eleanor, my dear," he said; "leave me, my darling, for a\r\nfew minutes, for I am busy."\r\n\r\nEleanor saw well how it was, but she did leave him, and glided\r\nsilently back to her drawing-room.  When he had sat a while, thus\r\nalone and unoccupied, he got up to walk again;--he could make more\r\nof his thoughts walking than sitting, and was creeping out into his\r\ngarden, when he met Bunce on the threshold.\r\n\r\n"Well, Bunce," said he, in a tone that for him was sharp, "what is it?\r\ndo you want me?"\r\n\r\n"I was only coming to ask after your reverence," said the old\r\nbedesman, touching his hat; "and to inquire about the news from\r\nLondon," he added after a pause.\r\n\r\nThe warden winced, and put his hand to his forehead and felt\r\nbewildered.\r\n\r\n"Attorney Finney has been there this morning," continued Bunce, "and\r\nby his looks I guess he is not so well pleased as he once was, and it\r\nhas got abroad somehow that the archdeacon has had down great news\r\nfrom London, and Handy and Moody are both as black as devils.  And I\r\nhope," said the man, trying to assume a cheery tone, "that things are\r\nlooking up, and that there\'ll be an end soon to all this stuff which\r\nbothers your reverence so sorely."\r\n\r\n"Well, I wish there may be, Bunce."\r\n\r\n"But about the news, your reverence?" said the old man, almost\r\nwhispering.\r\n\r\nMr Harding walked on, and shook his head impatiently.  Poor Bunce\r\nlittle knew how he was tormenting his patron.\r\n\r\n"If there was anything to cheer you, I should be so glad to know it,"\r\nsaid he, with a tone of affection which the warden in all his misery\r\ncould not resist.\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and took both the old man\'s hands in his.  "My friend,"\r\nsaid he, "my dear old friend, there is nothing; there is no news to\r\ncheer me;--God\'s will be done": and two small hot tears broke away\r\nfrom his eyes and stole down his furrowed cheeks.\r\n\r\n"Then God\'s will be done," said the other solemnly; "but they told\r\nme that there was good news from London, and I came to wish your\r\nreverence joy; but God\'s will be done;" and so the warden again walked\r\non, and the bedesman, looking wistfully after him and receiving no\r\nencouragement to follow, returned sadly to his own abode.\r\n\r\nFor a couple of hours the warden remained thus in the garden, now\r\nwalking, now standing motionless on the turf, and then, as his legs\r\ngot weary, sitting unconsciously on the garden seats, and then walking\r\nagain.  And Eleanor, hidden behind the muslin curtains of the window,\r\nwatched him through the trees as he now came in sight, and then again\r\nwas concealed by the turnings of the walk; and thus the time passed\r\naway till five, when the warden crept back to the house and prepared\r\nfor dinner.\r\n\r\nIt was but a sorry meal.  The demure parlour-maid, as she handed the\r\ndishes and changed the plates, saw that all was not right, and was\r\nmore demure than ever: neither father nor daughter could eat, and the\r\nhateful food was soon cleared away, and the bottle of port placed upon\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n"Would you like Bunce to come in, papa?" said Eleanor, thinking that\r\nthe company of the old man might lighten his sorrow.\r\n\r\n"No, my dear, thank you, not to-day; but are not you going out,\r\nEleanor, this lovely afternoon? don\'t stay in for me, my dear."\r\n\r\n"I thought you seemed so sad, papa."\r\n\r\n"Sad," said he, irritated; "well, people must all have their share of\r\nsadness here; I am not more exempt than another: but kiss me, dearest,\r\nand go now; I will, if possible, be more sociable when you return."\r\n\r\nAnd Eleanor was again banished from her father\'s sorrow.  Ah! her\r\ndesire now was not to find him happy, but to be allowed to share his\r\nsorrows; not to force him to be sociable, but to persuade him to be\r\ntrustful.\r\n\r\nShe put on her bonnet as desired, and went up to Mary Bold; this was\r\nnow her daily haunt, for John Bold was up in London among lawyers and\r\nchurch reformers, diving deep into other questions than that of the\r\nwardenship of Barchester; supplying information to one member of\r\nParliament, and dining with another; subscribing to funds for the\r\nabolition of clerical incomes, and seconding at that great national\r\nmeeting at the Crown and Anchor a resolution to the effect, that no\r\nclergyman of the Church of England, be he who he might, should have\r\nmore than a thousand a year, and none less than two hundred and fifty.\r\nHis speech on this occasion was short, for fifteen had to speak, and\r\nthe room was hired for two hours only, at the expiration of which\r\nthe Quakers and Mr Cobden were to make use of it for an appeal to\r\nthe public in aid of the Emperor of Russia; but it was sharp and\r\neffective; at least he was told so by a companion with whom he now\r\nlived much, and on whom he greatly depended,--one Tom Towers, a very\r\nleading genius, and supposed to have high employment on the staff of\r\n_The Jupiter_.\r\n\r\nSo Eleanor, as was now her wont, went up to Mary Bold, and Mary\r\nlistened kindly, while the daughter spoke much of her father, and,\r\nperhaps kinder still, found a listener in Eleanor, while she spoke\r\nabout her brother.  In the meantime the warden sat alone, leaning on\r\nthe arm of his chair; he had poured out a glass of wine, but had done\r\nso merely from habit, for he left it untouched; there he sat gazing\r\nat the open window, and thinking, if he can be said to have thought,\r\nof the happiness of his past life.  All manner of past delights came\r\nbefore his mind, which at the time he had enjoyed without considering\r\nthem; his easy days, his absence of all kind of hard work, his\r\npleasant shady home, those twelve old neighbours whose welfare till\r\nnow had been the source of so much pleasant care, the excellence\r\nof his children, the friendship of the dear old bishop, the solemn\r\ngrandeur of those vaulted aisles, through which he loved to hear his\r\nown voice pealing; and then that friend of friends, that choice ally\r\nthat had never deserted him, that eloquent companion that would\r\nalways, when asked, discourse such pleasant music, that violoncello\r\nof his;--ah, how happy he had been! but it was over now; his easy\r\ndays and absence of work had been the crime which brought on him his\r\ntribulation; his shady home was pleasant no longer; maybe it was no\r\nlonger his; the old neighbours, whose welfare had been so desired by\r\nhim, were his enemies; his daughter was as wretched as himself; and\r\neven the bishop was made miserable by his position.  He could never\r\nagain lift up his voice boldly as he had hitherto done among his\r\nbrethren, for he felt that he was disgraced; and he feared even to\r\ntouch his bow, for he knew how grievous a sound of wailing, how\r\npiteous a lamentation, it would produce.\r\n\r\nHe was still sitting in the same chair and the same posture, having\r\nhardly moved a limb for two hours, when Eleanor came back to tea, and\r\nsucceeded in bringing him with her into the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nThe tea seemed as comfortless as the dinner, though the warden, who\r\nhad hitherto eaten nothing all day, devoured the plateful of bread and\r\nbutter, unconscious of what he was doing.\r\n\r\nEleanor had made up her mind to force him to talk to her, but she\r\nhardly knew how to commence: she must wait till the urn was gone, till\r\nthe servant would no longer be coming in and out.\r\n\r\nAt last everything was gone, and the drawing-room door was permanently\r\nclosed; then Eleanor, getting up and going round to her father, put\r\nher arm round his neck, and said, "Papa, won\'t you tell me what it\r\nis?"\r\n\r\n"What what is, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"This new sorrow that torments you; I know you are unhappy, papa."\r\n\r\n"New sorrow! it\'s no new sorrow, my dear; we have all our cares\r\nsometimes;" and he tried to smile, but it was a ghastly failure; "but\r\nI shouldn\'t be so dull a companion; come, we\'ll have some music."\r\n\r\n"No, papa, not tonight,--it would only trouble you tonight;" and she\r\nsat upon his knee, as she sometimes would in their gayest moods, and\r\nwith her arm round his neck, she said: "Papa, I will not leave you\r\ntill you talk to me; oh, if you only knew how much good it would do\r\nto you, to tell me of it all."\r\n\r\nThe father kissed his daughter, and pressed her to his heart; but\r\nstill he said nothing: it was so hard to him to speak of his own\r\nsorrows; he was so shy a man even with his own child!\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa, do tell me what it is; I know it is about the hospital, and\r\nwhat they are doing up in London, and what that cruel newspaper has\r\nsaid; but if there be such cause for sorrow, let us be sorrowful\r\ntogether; we are all in all to each other now: dear, dear papa, do\r\nspeak to me."\r\n\r\nMr Harding could not well speak now, for the warm tears were running\r\ndown his cheeks like rain in May, but he held his child close to his\r\nheart, and squeezed her hand as a lover might, and she kissed his\r\nforehead and his wet cheeks, and lay upon his bosom, and comforted him\r\nas a woman only can do.\r\n\r\n"My own child," he said, as soon as his tears would let him speak, "my\r\nown, own child, why should you too be unhappy before it is necessary?\r\nIt may come to that, that we must leave this place, but till that time\r\ncomes, why should your young days be clouded?"\r\n\r\n"And is that all, papa?  If that be all, let us leave it, and have\r\nlight hearts elsewhere: if that be all, let us go.  Oh, papa, you and\r\nI could be happy if we had only bread to eat, so long as our hearts\r\nwere light."\r\n\r\nAnd Eleanor\'s face was lighted up with enthusiasm as she told her\r\nfather how he might banish all his care; and a gleam of joy shot\r\nacross his brow as this idea of escape again presented itself, and\r\nhe again fancied for a moment that he could spurn away from him the\r\nincome which the world envied him; that he could give the lie to that\r\nwielder of the tomahawk who had dared to write such things of him in\r\n_The Jupiter_; that he could leave Sir Abraham, and the archdeacon,\r\nand Bold, and the rest of them with their lawsuit among them, and\r\nwipe his hands altogether of so sorrow-stirring a concern.  Ah, what\r\nhappiness might there be in the distance, with Eleanor and him in some\r\nsmall cottage, and nothing left of their former grandeur but their\r\nmusic!  Yes, they would walk forth with their music books, and their\r\ninstruments, and shaking the dust from off their feet as they went,\r\nleave the ungrateful place. Never did a poor clergyman sigh for a warm\r\nbenefice more anxiously than our warden did now to be rid of his.\r\n\r\n"Give it up, papa," she said again, jumping from his knees and\r\nstanding on her feet before him, looking boldly into his face; "give\r\nit up, papa."\r\n\r\nOh, it was sad to see how that momentary gleam of joy passed away;\r\nhow the look of hope was dispersed from that sorrowful face, as the\r\nremembrance of the archdeacon came back upon our poor warden, and he\r\nreflected that he could not stir from his now hated post.  He was as\r\na man bound with iron, fettered with adamant: he was in no respect a\r\nfree agent; he had no choice.  "Give it up!"  Oh if he only could:\r\nwhat an easy way that were out of all his troubles!\r\n\r\n"Papa, don\'t doubt about it," she continued, thinking that his\r\nhesitation arose from his unwillingness to abandon so comfortable\r\na home; "is it on my account that you would stay here?  Do you\r\nthink that I cannot be happy without a pony-carriage and a fine\r\ndrawing-room?  Papa, I never can be happy here, as long as there is a\r\nquestion as to your honour in staying here; but I could be gay as the\r\nday is long in the smallest tiny little cottage, if I could see you\r\ncome in and go out with a light heart.  Oh! papa, your face tells so\r\nmuch; though you won\'t speak to me with your voice, I know how it is\r\nwith you every time I look at you."\r\n\r\nHow he pressed her to his heart again with almost a spasmodic\r\npressure!  How he kissed her as the tears fell like rain from his old\r\neyes!  How he blessed her, and called her by a hundred soft sweet\r\nnames which now came new to his lips!  How he chid himself for ever\r\nhaving been unhappy with such a treasure in his house, such a jewel on\r\nhis bosom, with so sweet a flower in the choice garden of his heart!\r\nAnd then the floodgates of his tongue were loosed, and, at length,\r\nwith unsparing detail of circumstances, he told her all that he\r\nwished, and all that he could not do.  He repeated those arguments\r\nof the archdeacon, not agreeing in their truth, but explaining his\r\ninability to escape from them;--how it had been declared to him that\r\nhe was bound to remain where he was by the interests of his order,\r\nby gratitude to the bishop, by the wishes of his friends, by a sense\r\nof duty, which, though he could not understand it, he was fain to\r\nacknowledge.  He told her how he had been accused of cowardice, and\r\nthough he was not a man to make much of such a charge before the\r\nworld, now in the full candour of his heart he explained to her that\r\nsuch an accusation was grievous to him; that he did think it would be\r\nunmanly to desert his post, merely to escape his present sufferings,\r\nand that, therefore, he must bear as best he might the misery which\r\nwas prepared for him.\r\n\r\nAnd did she find these details tedious?  Oh, no; she encouraged him\r\nto dilate on every feeling he expressed, till he laid bare the inmost\r\ncorners of his heart to her.  They spoke together of the archdeacon,\r\nas two children might of a stern, unpopular, but still respected\r\nschoolmaster, and of the bishop as a parent kind as kind could be, but\r\npowerless against an omnipotent pedagogue.\r\n\r\nAnd then when they had discussed all this, when the father had told\r\nall to the child, she could not be less confiding than he had been;\r\nand as John Bold\'s name was mentioned between them, she owned how well\r\nshe had learned to love him,--"had loved him once," she said, "but she\r\nwould not, could not do so now--no, even had her troth been plighted\r\nto him, she would have taken it back again;--had she sworn to love\r\nhim as his wife, she would have discarded him, and not felt herself\r\nforsworn, when he proved himself the enemy of her father."\r\n\r\nBut the warden declared that Bold was no enemy of his, and encouraged\r\nher love; and gently rebuked, as he kissed her, the stern resolve she\r\nhad made to cast him off; and then he spoke to her of happier days\r\nwhen their trials would all be over; and declared that her young heart\r\nshould not be torn asunder to please either priest or prelate, dean or\r\narchdeacon.  No, not if all Oxford were to convocate together, and\r\nagree as to the necessity of the sacrifice.\r\n\r\nAnd so they greatly comforted each other;--and in what sorrow will not\r\nsuch mutual confidence give consolation!--and with a last expression\r\nof tender love they parted, and went comparatively happy to their\r\nrooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI\r\n\r\nIPHIGENIA\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Eleanor laid her head on her pillow that night, her mind was\r\nanxiously intent on some plan by which she might extricate her father\r\nfrom his misery; and, in her warm-hearted enthusiasm, self-sacrifice\r\nwas decided on as the means to be adopted.  Was not so good an\r\nAgamemnon worthy of an Iphigenia?  She would herself personally\r\nimplore John Bold to desist from his undertaking; she would explain to\r\nhim her father\'s sorrows, the cruel misery of his position; she would\r\ntell him how her father would die if he were thus dragged before the\r\npublic and exposed to such unmerited ignominy; she would appeal to his\r\nold friendship, to his generosity, to his manliness, to his mercy; if\r\nneed were, she would kneel to him for the favour she would ask; but\r\nbefore she did this the idea of love must be banished.  There must be\r\nno bargain in the matter.  To his mercy, to his generosity, she could\r\nappeal; but as a pure maiden, hitherto even unsolicited, she could not\r\nappeal to his love, nor under such circumstances could she allow him\r\nto do so.  Of course, when so provoked he would declare his passion;\r\nthat was to be expected; there had been enough between them to make\r\nsuch a fact sure; but it was equally certain that he must be rejected.\r\nShe could not be understood as saying, Make my father free and I\r\nam the reward.  There would be no sacrifice in that;--not so had\r\nJephthah\'s daughter saved her father;--not so could she show to\r\nthat kindest, dearest of parents how much she was able to bear for\r\nhis good.  No; to one resolve must her whole soul be bound; and so\r\nresolving, she felt that she could make her great request to Bold\r\nwith as much self-assured confidence as she could have done to his\r\ngrandfather.\r\n\r\nAnd now I own I have fears for my heroine; not as to the upshot of her\r\nmission,--not in the least as to that; as to the full success of her\r\ngenerous scheme, and the ultimate result of such a project, no one\r\nconversant with human nature and novels can have a doubt; but as to\r\nthe amount of sympathy she may receive from those of her own sex.\r\nGirls below twenty and old ladies above sixty will do her justice; for\r\nin the female heart the soft springs of sweet romance reopen after\r\nmany years, and again gush out with waters pure as in earlier days,\r\nand greatly refresh the path that leads downwards to the grave.\r\nBut I fear that the majority of those between these two eras will\r\nnot approve of Eleanor\'s plan.  I fear that unmarried ladies of\r\nthirty-five will declare that there can be no probability of so absurd\r\na project being carried through; that young women on their knees\r\nbefore their lovers are sure to get kissed, and that they would not\r\nput themselves in such a position did they not expect it; that Eleanor\r\nis going to Bold only because circumstances prevent Bold from coming\r\nto her; that she is certainly a little fool, or a little schemer, but\r\nthat in all probability she is thinking a good deal more about herself\r\nthan her father.\r\n\r\nDear ladies, you are right as to your appreciation of the\r\ncircumstances, but very wrong as to Miss Harding\'s character.  Miss\r\nHarding was much younger than you are, and could not, therefore, know,\r\nas you may do, to what dangers such an encounter might expose her.\r\nShe may get kissed; I think it very probable that she will; but I give\r\nmy solemn word and positive assurance, that the remotest idea of such\r\na catastrophe never occurred to her as she made the great resolve now\r\nalluded to.\r\n\r\nAnd then she slept; and then she rose refreshed; and met her father\r\nwith her kindest embrace and most loving smiles; and on the whole\r\ntheir breakfast was by no means so triste as had been their dinner the\r\nday before; and then, making some excuse to her father for so soon\r\nleaving him, she started on the commencement of her operations.\r\n\r\nShe knew that John Bold was in London, and that, therefore, the scene\r\nitself could not be enacted to-day; but she also knew that he was soon\r\nto be home, probably on the next day, and it was necessary that some\r\nlittle plan for meeting him should be concerted with his sister Mary.\r\nWhen she got up to the house, she went, as usual, into the morning\r\nsitting-room, and was startled by perceiving, by a stick, a greatcoat,\r\nand sundry parcels which were lying about, that Bold must already have\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n"John has come back so suddenly," said Mary, coming into the room; "he\r\nhas been travelling all night."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'ll come up again some other time," said Eleanor, about to beat\r\na retreat in her sudden dismay.\r\n\r\n"He\'s out now, and will be for the next two hours," said the other;\r\n"he\'s with that horrid Finney; he only came to see him, and he returns\r\nby the mail train tonight."\r\n\r\nReturns by the mail train tonight, thought Eleanor to herself, as she\r\nstrove to screw up her courage;--away again tonight;--then it must be\r\nnow or never; and she again sat down, having risen to go.\r\n\r\nShe wished the ordeal could have been postponed: she had fully made\r\nup her mind to do the deed, but she had not made up her mind to do it\r\nthis very day; and now she felt ill at ease, astray, and in\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n"Mary," she began, "I must see your brother before he goes back."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, of course," said the other; "I know he\'ll be delighted to see\r\nyou;" and she tried to treat it as a matter of course, but she was not\r\nthe less surprised; for Mary and Eleanor had daily talked over John\r\nBold and his conduct, and his love, and Mary would insist on calling\r\nEleanor her sister, and would scold her for not calling Bold by his\r\nChristian name; and Eleanor would half confess her love, but like a\r\nmodest maiden would protest against such familiarities even with the\r\nname of her lover; and so they talked hour after hour, and Mary Bold,\r\nwho was much the elder, looked forward with happy confidence to the\r\nday when Eleanor would not be ashamed to call her her sister.  She\r\nwas, however, fully sure that just at present Eleanor would be much\r\nmore likely to avoid her brother than to seek him.\r\n\r\n"Mary, I must see your brother, now, to-day, and beg from him a great\r\nfavour;" and she spoke with a solemn air, not at all usual to her;\r\nand then she went on, and opened to her friend all her plan, her\r\nwell-weighed scheme for saving her father from a sorrow which would,\r\nshe said, if it lasted, bring him to his grave.  "But, Mary," she\r\ncontinued, "you must now, you know, cease any joking about me and Mr\r\nBold; you must now say no more about that; I am not ashamed to beg\r\nthis favour from your brother, but when I have done so, there can\r\nnever be anything further between us;" and this she said with a staid\r\nand solemn air, quite worthy of Jephthah\'s daughter or of Iphigenia\r\neither.\r\n\r\nIt was quite clear that Mary Bold did not follow the argument.  That\r\nEleanor Harding should appeal, on behalf of her father, to Bold\'s\r\nbetter feelings seemed to Mary quite natural; it seemed quite natural\r\nthat he should relent, overcome by such filial tears, and by so much\r\nbeauty; but, to her thinking, it was at any rate equally natural, that\r\nhaving relented, John should put his arm round his mistress\'s waist,\r\nand say: "Now having settled that, let us be man and wife, and all\r\nwill end happily!"  Why his good nature should not be rewarded, when\r\nsuch reward would operate to the disadvantage of none, Mary, who had\r\nmore sense than romance, could not understand; and she said as much.\r\n\r\nEleanor, however, was firm, and made quite an eloquent speech to\r\nsupport her own view of the question: she could not condescend, she\r\nsaid, to ask such a favour on any other terms than those proposed.\r\nMary might, perhaps, think her high-flown, but she had her own ideas,\r\nand she could not submit to sacrifice her self-respect.\r\n\r\n"But I am sure you love him;--don\'t you?" pleaded Mary; "and I am sure\r\nhe loves you better than anything in the world."\r\n\r\nEleanor was going to make another speech, but a tear came to each eye,\r\nand she could not; so she pretended to blow her nose, and walked to\r\nthe window, and made a little inward call on her own courage, and\r\nfinding herself somewhat sustained, said sententiously: "Mary, this\r\nis nonsense."\r\n\r\n"But you do love him," said Mary, who had followed her friend to the\r\nwindow, and now spoke with her arms close wound round the other\'s\r\nwaist.  "You do love him with all your heart,--you know you do; I defy\r\nyou to deny it."\r\n\r\n"I--" commenced Eleanor, turning sharply round to refute the charge;\r\nbut the intended falsehood stuck in her throat, and never came to\r\nutterance.  She could not deny her love, so she took plentifully\r\nto tears, and leant upon her friend\'s bosom and sobbed there, and\r\nprotested that, love or no love, it would make no difference in her\r\nresolve, and called Mary, a thousand times, the most cruel of girls,\r\nand swore her to secrecy by a hundred oaths, and ended by declaring\r\nthat the girl who could betray her friend\'s love, even to a brother,\r\nwould be as black a traitor as a soldier in a garrison who should\r\nopen the city gates to the enemy.  While they were yet discussing the\r\nmatter, Bold returned, and Eleanor was forced into sudden action: she\r\nhad either to accomplish or abandon her plan; and having slipped into\r\nher friend\'s bedroom, as the gentleman closed the hall door, she\r\nwashed the marks of tears from her eyes, and resolved within herself\r\nto go through with it.  "Tell him I am here," said she, "and coming\r\nin; and mind, whatever you do, don\'t leave us."  So Mary informed her\r\nbrother, with a somewhat sombre air, that Miss Harding was in the next\r\nroom, and was coming to speak to him.\r\n\r\nEleanor was certainly thinking more of her father than herself, as she\r\narranged her hair before the glass, and removed the traces of sorrow\r\nfrom her face; and yet I should be untrue if I said that she was not\r\nanxious to appear well before her lover: why else was she so sedulous\r\nwith that stubborn curl that would rebel against her hand, and smooth\r\nso eagerly her ruffled ribands? why else did she damp her eyes to\r\ndispel the redness, and bite her pretty lips to bring back the colour?\r\nOf course she was anxious to look her best, for she was but a mortal\r\nangel after all.  But had she been immortal, had she flitted back to\r\nthe sitting-room on a cherub\'s wings, she could not have had a more\r\nfaithful heart, or a truer wish to save her father at any cost to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nJohn Bold had not met her since the day when she left him in dudgeon\r\nin the cathedral close.  Since then his whole time had been occupied\r\nin promoting the cause against her father, and not unsuccessfully.\r\nHe had often thought of her, and turned over in his mind a hundred\r\nschemes for showing her how disinterested was his love.  He would\r\nwrite to her and beseech her not to allow the performance of a public\r\nduty to injure him in her estimation; he would write to Mr Harding,\r\nexplain all his views, and boldly claim the warden\'s daughter, urging\r\nthat the untoward circumstances between them need be no bar to their\r\nancient friendship, or to a closer tie; he would throw himself on his\r\nknees before his mistress; he would wait and marry the daughter when\r\nthe father has lost his home and his income; he would give up the\r\nlawsuit and go to Australia, with her of course, leaving _The Jupiter_\r\nand Mr Finney to complete the case between them.  Sometimes as he woke\r\nin the morning fevered and impatient, he would blow out his brains and\r\nhave done with all his cares;--but this idea was generally consequent\r\non an imprudent supper enjoyed in company with Tom Towers.\r\n\r\nHow beautiful Eleanor appeared to him as she slowly walked into the\r\nroom!  Not for nothing had all those little cares been taken.  Though\r\nher sister, the archdeacon\'s wife, had spoken slightingly of her\r\ncharms, Eleanor was very beautiful when seen aright.  Hers was not of\r\nthose impassive faces, which have the beauty of a marble bust; finely\r\nchiselled features, perfect in every line, true to the rules of\r\nsymmetry, as lovely to a stranger as to a friend, unvarying unless in\r\nsickness, or as age affects them.  She had no startling brilliancy of\r\nbeauty, no pearly whiteness, no radiant carnation.  She had not the\r\nmajestic contour that rivets attention, demands instant wonder, and\r\nthen disappoints by the coldness of its charms.  You might pass\r\nEleanor Harding in the street without notice, but you could hardly\r\npass an evening with her and not lose your heart.\r\n\r\nShe had never appeared more lovely to her lover than she now did.  Her\r\nface was animated though it was serious, and her full dark lustrous\r\neyes shone with anxious energy; her hand trembled as she took his, and\r\nshe could hardly pronounce his name, when she addressed him.  Bold\r\nwished with all his heart that the Australian scheme was in the act of\r\nrealisation, and that he and Eleanor were away together, never to hear\r\nfurther of the lawsuit.\r\n\r\nHe began to talk, asked after her health,--said something about London\r\nbeing very stupid, and more about Barchester being very pleasant;\r\ndeclared the weather to be very hot, and then inquired after Mr\r\nHarding.\r\n\r\n"My father is not very well," said Eleanor.\r\n\r\nJohn Bold was very sorry,--so sorry: he hoped it was nothing serious,\r\nand put on the unmeaningly solemn face which people usually use on\r\nsuch occasions.\r\n\r\n"I especially want to speak to you about my father, Mr Bold; indeed, I\r\nam now here on purpose to do so.  Papa is very unhappy, very unhappy\r\nindeed, about this affair of the hospital: you would pity him, Mr\r\nBold, if you could see how wretched it has made him."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Miss Harding!"\r\n\r\n"Indeed you would;--anyone would pity him; but a friend, an old friend\r\nas you are,--indeed you would.  He is an altered man; his cheerfulness\r\nhas all gone, and his sweet temper, and his kind happy tone of voice;\r\nyou would hardly know him if you saw him, Mr Bold, he is so much\r\naltered; and--and--if this goes on, he will die."  Here Eleanor had\r\nrecourse to her handkerchief, and so also had her auditors; but she\r\nplucked up her courage, and went on with her tale.  "He will break his\r\nheart, and die.  I am sure, Mr Bold, it was not you who wrote those\r\ncruel things in the newspaper--"\r\n\r\nJohn Bold eagerly protested that it was not, but his heart smote him\r\nas to his intimate alliance with Tom Towers.\r\n\r\n"No, I am sure it was not; and papa has not for a moment thought so;\r\nyou would not be so cruel;--but it has nearly killed him.  Papa cannot\r\nbear to think that people should so speak of him, and that everybody\r\nshould hear him so spoken of:--they have called him avaricious, and\r\ndishonest, and they say he is robbing the old men, and taking the\r\nmoney of the hospital for nothing."\r\n\r\n"I have never said so, Miss Harding.  I--"\r\n\r\n"No," continued Eleanor, interrupting him, for she was now in the full\r\nflood-tide of her eloquence; "no, I am sure you have not; but others\r\nhave said so; and if this goes on, if such things are written again,\r\nit will kill papa.  Oh! Mr Bold, if you only knew the state he is in!\r\nNow papa does not care much about money."\r\n\r\nBoth her auditors, brother and sister, assented to this, and declared\r\non their own knowledge that no man lived less addicted to filthy lucre\r\nthan the warden.\r\n\r\n"Oh! it\'s so kind of you to say so, Mary, and of you too, Mr Bold.\r\nI couldn\'t bear that people should think unjustly of papa.  Do you\r\nknow he would give up the hospital altogether, only he cannot.  The\r\narchdeacon says it would be cowardly, and that he would be deserting\r\nhis order, and injuring the church.  Whatever may happen, papa will\r\nnot do that: he would leave the place to-morrow willingly, and give\r\nup his house, and the income and all, if the archdeacon--"\r\n\r\nEleanor was going to say "would let him," but she stopped herself\r\nbefore she had compromised her father\'s dignity; and giving a long\r\nsigh, she added--"Oh, I do so wish he would."\r\n\r\n"No one who knows Mr Harding personally accuses him for a moment,"\r\nsaid Bold.\r\n\r\n"It is he that has to bear the punishment; it is he that suffers,"\r\nsaid Eleanor; "and what for? what has he done wrong? how has he\r\ndeserved this persecution? he that never had an unkind thought in his\r\nlife, he that never said an unkind word!" and here she broke down, and\r\nthe violence of her sobs stopped her utterance.\r\n\r\nBold, for the fifth or sixth time, declared that neither he nor any of\r\nhis friends imputed any blame personally to Mr Harding.\r\n\r\n"Then why should he be persecuted?" ejaculated Eleanor through her\r\ntears, forgetting in her eagerness that her intention had been to\r\nhumble herself as a suppliant before John Bold;--"why should he be\r\nsingled out for scorn and disgrace? why should he be made so wretched?\r\nOh! Mr Bold,"--and she turned towards him as though the kneeling scene\r\nwere about to be commenced,--"oh! Mr Bold, why did you begin all this?\r\nYou, whom we all so--so--valued!"\r\n\r\nTo speak the truth, the reformer\'s punishment was certainly come upon\r\nhim, for his present plight was not enviable; he had nothing for it\r\nbut to excuse himself by platitudes about public duty, which it is\r\nby no means worth while to repeat, and to reiterate his eulogy on Mr\r\nHarding\'s character.  His position was certainly a cruel one: had any\r\ngentleman called upon him on behalf of Mr Harding he could of course\r\nhave declined to enter upon the subject; but how could he do so with a\r\nbeautiful girl, with the daughter of the man whom he had injured, with\r\nhis own love?\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Eleanor recollected herself, and again summoned up\r\nher energies.  "Mr Bold," said she, "I have come here to implore you\r\nto abandon this proceeding."  He stood up from his seat, and looked\r\nbeyond measure distressed.  "To implore you to abandon it, to implore\r\nyou to spare my father, to spare either his life or his reason, for\r\none or the other will pay the forfeit if this goes on.  I know how\r\nmuch I am asking, and how little right I have to ask anything; but\r\nI think you will listen to me as it is for my father.  Oh, Mr Bold,\r\npray, pray do this for us;--pray do not drive to distraction a man who\r\nhas loved you so well."\r\n\r\nShe did not absolutely kneel to him, but she followed him as he moved\r\nfrom his chair, and laid her soft hands imploringly upon his arm.  Ah!\r\nat any other time how exquisitely valuable would have been that touch!\r\nbut now he was distraught, dumbfounded, and unmanned.  What could he\r\nsay to that sweet suppliant; how explain to her that the matter now\r\nwas probably beyond his control; how tell her that he could not quell\r\nthe storm which he had raised?\r\n\r\n"Surely, surely, John, you cannot refuse her," said his sister.\r\n\r\n"I would give her my soul," said he, "if it would serve her."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr Bold," said Eleanor, "do not speak so; I ask nothing for\r\nmyself; and what I ask for my father, it cannot harm you to grant."\r\n\r\n"I would give her my soul, if it would serve her," said Bold, still\r\naddressing his sister; "everything I have is hers, if she will accept\r\nit; my house, my heart, my all; every hope of my breast is centred in\r\nher; her smiles are sweeter to me than the sun, and when I see her in\r\nsorrow as she now is, every nerve in my body suffers.  No man can love\r\nbetter than I love her."\r\n\r\n"No, no, no," ejaculated Eleanor; "there can be no talk of love\r\nbetween us.  Will you protect my father from the evil you have brought\r\nupon him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Eleanor, I will do anything; let me tell you how I love you!"\r\n\r\n"No, no, no!" she almost screamed.  "This is unmanly of you, Mr Bold.\r\nWill you, will you, will you leave my father to die in peace in his\r\nquiet home?" and seizing him by his arm and hand, she followed him\r\nacross the room towards the door.  "I will not leave you till you\r\npromise me; I\'ll cling to you in the street; I\'ll kneel to you before\r\nall the people.  You shall promise me this, you shall promise me this,\r\nyou shall--" And she clung to him with fixed tenacity, and reiterated\r\nher resolve with hysterical passion.\r\n\r\n"Speak to her, John; answer her," said Mary, bewildered by the\r\nunexpected vehemence of Eleanor\'s manner; "you cannot have the cruelty\r\nto refuse her."\r\n\r\n"Promise me, promise me," said Eleanor; "say that my father is\r\nsafe;--one word will do.  I know how true you are; say one word, and I\r\nwill let you go."\r\n\r\nShe still held him, and looked eagerly into his face, with her hair\r\ndishevelled and her eyes all bloodshot.  She had no thought now of\r\nherself, no care now for her appearance; and yet he thought he had\r\nnever seen her half so lovely; he was amazed at the intensity of her\r\nbeauty, and could hardly believe that it was she whom he had dared to\r\nlove.  "Promise me," said she; "I will not leave you till you have\r\npromised me."\r\n\r\n"I will," said he at length; "I do--all I can do, I will do."\r\n\r\n"Then may God Almighty bless you for ever and ever!" said Eleanor; and\r\nfalling on her knees with her face in Mary\'s lap, she wept and sobbed\r\nlike a child: her strength had carried her through her allotted task,\r\nbut now it was well nigh exhausted.\r\n\r\nIn a while she was partly recovered, and got up to go, and would have\r\ngone, had not Bold made her understand that it was necessary for him\r\nto explain to her how far it was in his power to put an end to the\r\nproceedings which had been taken against Mr Harding.  Had he spoken on\r\nany other subject, she would have vanished, but on that she was bound\r\nto hear him; and now the danger of her position commenced.  While she\r\nhad an active part to play, while she clung to him as a suppliant, it\r\nwas easy enough for her to reject his proffered love, and cast from\r\nher his caressing words; but now--now that he had yielded, and was\r\ntalking to her calmly and kindly as to her father\'s welfare, it was\r\nhard enough for her to do so.  Then Mary Bold assisted her; but now\r\nshe was quite on her brother\'s side.  Mary said but little, but every\r\nword she did say gave some direct and deadly blow.  The first thing\r\nshe did was to make room for her brother between herself and Eleanor\r\non the sofa: as the sofa was full large for three, Eleanor could not\r\nresent this, nor could she show suspicion by taking another seat; but\r\nshe felt it to be a most unkind proceeding.  And then Mary would talk\r\nas though they three were joined in some close peculiar bond together;\r\nas though they were in future always to wish together, contrive\r\ntogether, and act together; and Eleanor could not gainsay this; she\r\ncould not make another speech, and say, "Mr Bold and I are strangers,\r\nMary, and are always to remain so!"\r\n\r\nHe explained to her that, though undoubtedly the proceeding against\r\nthe hospital had commenced solely with himself, many others were now\r\ninterested in the matter, some of whom were much more influential than\r\nhimself; that it was to him alone, however, that the lawyers looked\r\nfor instruction as to their doings, and, more important still, for\r\nthe payment of their bills; and he promised that he would at once\r\ngive them notice that it was his intention to abandon the cause.  He\r\nthought, he said, that it was not probable that any active steps would\r\nbe taken after he had seceded from the matter, though it was possible\r\nthat some passing allusion might still be made to the hospital in the\r\ndaily _Jupiter_.  He promised, however, that he would use his best\r\ninfluence to prevent any further personal allusion being made to Mr\r\nHarding.  He then suggested that he would on that afternoon ride over\r\nhimself to Dr Grantly, and inform him of his altered intentions on the\r\nsubject, and with this view, he postponed his immediate return to\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nThis was all very pleasant, and Eleanor did enjoy a sort of triumph in\r\nthe feeling that she had attained the object for which she had sought\r\nthis interview; but still the part of Iphigenia was to be played out.\r\nThe gods had heard her prayer, granted her request, and were they not\r\nto have their promised sacrifice?  Eleanor was not a girl to defraud\r\nthem wilfully; so, as soon as she decently could, she got up for her\r\nbonnet.\r\n\r\n"Are you going so soon?" said Bold, who half an hour since would\r\nhave given a hundred pounds that he was in London, and she still at\r\nBarchester.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes!" said she.  "I am so much obliged to you; papa will feel\r\nthis to be so kind."  She did not quite appreciate all her father\'s\r\nfeelings.  "Of course I must tell him, and I will say that you will\r\nsee the archdeacon."\r\n\r\n"But may I not say one word for myself?" said Bold.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll fetch you your bonnet, Eleanor," said Mary, in the act of\r\nleaving the room.\r\n\r\n"Mary, Mary," said she, getting up and catching her by her dress;\r\n"don\'t go, I\'ll get my bonnet myself."  But Mary, the traitress, stood\r\nfast by the door, and permitted no such retreat. Poor Iphigenia!\r\n\r\nAnd with a volley of impassioned love, John Bold poured forth the\r\nfeelings of his heart, swearing, as men do, some truths and many\r\nfalsehoods; and Eleanor repeated with every shade of vehemence the\r\n"No, no, no," which had had a short time since so much effect; but\r\nnow, alas! its strength was gone.  Let her be never so vehement, her\r\nvehemence was not respected; all her "No, no, no\'s" were met with\r\ncounter-asseverations, and at last were overpowered.  The ground was\r\ncut from under her on every side.  She was pressed to say whether her\r\nfather would object; whether she herself had any aversion (aversion!\r\nGod help her, poor girl! the word nearly made her jump into his arms);\r\nany other preference (this she loudly disclaimed); whether it was\r\nimpossible that she should love him (Eleanor could not say that it\r\nwas impossible): and so at last all her defences demolished, all her\r\nmaiden barriers swept away, she capitulated, or rather marched out\r\nwith the honours of war, vanquished evidently, palpably vanquished,\r\nbut still not reduced to the necessity of confessing it.\r\n\r\nAnd so the altar on the shore of the modern Aulis reeked with no\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII\r\n\r\nMR BOLD\'S VISIT TO PLUMSTEAD\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether or no the ill-natured prediction made by certain ladies in\r\nthe beginning of the last chapter was or was not carried out to the\r\nletter, I am not in a position to state.  Eleanor, however, certainly\r\ndid feel herself to have been baffled as she returned home with all\r\nher news to her father.  Certainly she had been victorious, certainly\r\nshe had achieved her object, certainly she was not unhappy, and yet\r\nshe did not feel herself triumphant.  Everything would run smooth now.\r\nEleanor was not at all addicted to the Lydian school of romance; she\r\nby no means objected to her lover because he came in at the door under\r\nthe name of Absolute, instead of pulling her out of a window under the\r\nname of Beverley; and yet she felt that she had been imposed upon, and\r\ncould hardly think of Mary Bold with sisterly charity.  "I did think\r\nI could have trusted Mary," she said to herself over and over again.\r\n"Oh that she should have dared to keep me in the room when I tried to\r\nget out!"  Eleanor, however, felt that the game was up, and that she\r\nhad now nothing further to do but to add to the budget of news which\r\nwas prepared for her father, that John Bold was her accepted lover.\r\n\r\nWe will, however, now leave her on her way, and go with John Bold to\r\nPlumstead Episcopi, merely premising that Eleanor on reaching home\r\nwill not find things so smooth as she fondly expected; two messengers\r\nhad come, one to her father and the other to the archdeacon, and\r\neach of them much opposed to her quiet mode of solving all their\r\ndifficulties; the one in the shape of a number of _The Jupiter_, and\r\nthe other in that of a further opinion from Sir Abraham Haphazard.\r\n\r\nJohn Bold got on his horse and rode off to Plumstead Episcopi; not\r\nbriskly and with eager spur, as men do ride when self-satisfied with\r\ntheir own intentions; but slowly, modestly, thoughtfully, and somewhat\r\nin dread of the coming interview.  Now and again he would recur to the\r\nscene which was just over, support himself by the remembrance of the\r\nsilence that gives consent, and exult as a happy lover.  But even this\r\nfeeling was not without a shade of remorse.  Had he not shown himself\r\nchildishly weak thus to yield up the resolve of many hours of thought\r\nto the tears of a pretty girl?  How was he to meet his lawyer?\r\nHow was he to back out of a matter in which his name was already so\r\npublicly concerned?  What, oh what! was he to say to Tom Towers?\r\nWhile meditating these painful things he reached the lodge leading up\r\nto the archdeacon\'s glebe, and for the first time in his life found\r\nhimself within the sacred precincts.\r\n\r\nAll the doctor\'s children were together on the slope of the lawn,\r\nclose to the road, as Bold rode up to the hall door.  They were there\r\nholding high debate on matters evidently of deep interest at Plumstead\r\nEpiscopi, and the voices of the boys had been heard before the lodge\r\ngate was closed.\r\n\r\nFlorinda and Grizzel, frightened at the sight of so well-known an\r\nenemy to the family, fled on the first appearance of the horseman,\r\nand ran in terror to their mother\'s arms; not for them was it, tender\r\nbranches, to resent injuries, or as members of a church militant to\r\nput on armour against its enemies.  But the boys stood their ground\r\nlike heroes, and boldly demanded the business of the intruder.\r\n\r\n"Do you want to see anybody here, sir?" said Henry, with a defiant eye\r\nand a hostile tone, which plainly said that at any rate no one there\r\nwanted to see the person so addressed; and as he spoke he brandished\r\naloft his garden water-pot, holding it by the spout, ready for the\r\nbraining of anyone.\r\n\r\n"Henry," said Charles James slowly, and with a certain dignity of\r\ndiction, "Mr Bold of course would not have come without wanting to see\r\nsomeone; if Mr Bold has a proper ground for wanting to see some person\r\nhere, of course he has a right to come."\r\n\r\nBut Samuel stepped lightly up to the horse\'s head, and offered his\r\nservices.  "Oh, Mr Bold," said he, "papa, I\'m sure, will be glad to\r\nsee you; I suppose you want to see papa.  Shall I hold your horse for\r\nyou?  Oh what a very pretty horse!" and he turned his head and winked\r\nfunnily at his brothers.  "Papa has heard such good news about the old\r\nhospital to-day.  We know you\'ll be glad to hear it, because you\'re\r\nsuch a friend of grandpapa Harding, and so much in love with Aunt\r\nNelly!"\r\n\r\n"How d\'ye do, lads?" said Bold, dismounting.  "I want to see your\r\nfather if he\'s at home."\r\n\r\n"Lads!" said Henry, turning on his heel and addressing himself to his\r\nbrother, but loud enough to be heard by Bold; "lads, indeed! if we\'re\r\nlads, what does he call himself?"\r\n\r\nCharles James condescended to say nothing further, but cocked his hat\r\nwith much precision, and left the visitor to the care of his youngest\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nSamuel stayed till the servant came, chatting and patting the horse;\r\nbut as soon as Bold had disappeared through the front door, he stuck\r\na switch under the animal\'s tail to make him kick if possible.\r\n\r\nThe church reformer soon found himself _t\xeate-\xe0-t\xeate_ with the\r\narchdeacon in that same room, in that sanctum sanctorum of the\r\nrectory, to which we have already been introduced.  As he entered he\r\nheard the click of a certain patent lock, but it struck him with no\r\nsurprise; the worthy clergyman was no doubt hiding from eyes profane\r\nhis last much-studied sermon; for the archdeacon, though he preached\r\nbut seldom, was famous for his sermons.  No room, Bold thought, could\r\nhave been more becoming for a dignitary of the church; each wall was\r\nloaded with theology; over each separate bookcase was printed in small\r\ngold letters the names of those great divines whose works were ranged\r\nbeneath: beginning from the early fathers in due chronological order,\r\nthere were to be found the precious labours of the chosen servants\r\nof the church down to the last pamphlet written in opposition to the\r\nconsecration of Dr Hampden; and raised above this were to be seen\r\nthe busts of the greatest among the great: Chrysostom, St Augustine,\r\nThomas \xe0 Becket, Cardinal Wolsey, Archbishop Laud, and Dr Philpotts.\r\n\r\nEvery appliance that could make study pleasant and give ease to the\r\novertoiled brain was there; chairs made to relieve each limb and\r\nmuscle; reading-desks and writing-desks to suit every attitude;\r\nlamps and candles mechanically contrived to throw their light on any\r\nfavoured spot, as the student might desire; a shoal of newspapers to\r\namuse the few leisure moments which might be stolen from the labours\r\nof the day; and then from the window a view right through a bosky\r\nvista along which ran a broad green path from the rectory to the\r\nchurch,--at the end of which the tawny-tinted fine old tower was seen\r\nwith all its variegated pinnacles and parapets.  Few parish churches\r\nin England are in better repair, or better worth keeping so, than that\r\nat Plumstead Episcopi; and yet it is built in a faulty style: the body\r\nof the church is low,--so low, that the nearly flat leaden roof would\r\nbe visible from the churchyard, were it not for the carved parapet\r\nwith which it is surrounded.  It is cruciform, though the transepts\r\nare irregular, one being larger than the other; and the tower is much\r\ntoo high in proportion to the church.  But the colour of the building\r\nis perfect; it is that rich yellow gray which one finds nowhere but in\r\nthe south and west of England, and which is so strong a characteristic\r\nof most of our old houses of Tudor architecture.  The stone work also\r\nis beautiful; the mullions of the windows and the thick tracery of\r\nthe Gothic workmanship is as rich as fancy can desire; and though in\r\ngazing on such a structure one knows by rule that the old priests who\r\nbuilt it, built it wrong, one cannot bring oneself to wish that they\r\nshould have made it other than it is.\r\n\r\nWhen Bold was ushered into the book-room, he found its owner standing\r\nwith his back to the empty fire-place ready to receive him, and he\r\ncould not but perceive that that expansive brow was elated with\r\ntriumph, and that those full heavy lips bore more prominently than\r\nusual an appearance of arrogant success.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr Bold," said he;--"well, what can I do for you?\r\nVery happy, I can assure you, to do anything for such a friend\r\nof my father-in-law."\r\n\r\n"I hope you\'ll excuse my calling, Dr Grantly."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, certainly," said the archdeacon; "I can assure you, no\r\napology is necessary from Mr Bold;--only let me know what I can do for\r\nhim."\r\n\r\nDr Grantly was standing himself, and he did not ask Bold to sit, and\r\ntherefore he had to tell his tale standing, leaning on the table, with\r\nhis hat in his hand.  He did, however, manage to tell it; and as the\r\narchdeacon never once interrupted him, or even encouraged him by a\r\nsingle word, he was not long in coming to the end of it.\r\n\r\n"And so, Mr Bold, I\'m to understand, I believe, that you are desirous\r\nof abandoning this attack upon Mr Harding."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Dr Grantly, there has been no attack, I can assure you--"\r\n\r\n"Well, well, we won\'t quarrel about words; I should call it an\r\nattack;--most men would so call an endeavour to take away from a man\r\nevery shilling of income that he has to live upon; but it sha\'n\'t be\r\nan attack, if you don\'t like it; you wish to abandon this--this little\r\ngame of backgammon you\'ve begun to play."\r\n\r\n"I intend to put an end to the legal proceedings which I have\r\ncommenced."\r\n\r\n"I understand," said the archdeacon.  "You\'ve already had enough\r\nof it; well, I can\'t say that I am surprised; carrying on a losing\r\nlawsuit where one has nothing to gain, but everything to pay, is not\r\npleasant."\r\n\r\nBold turned very red in the face.  "You misinterpret my motives," said\r\nhe; "but, however, that is of little consequence.  I did not come\r\nto trouble you with my motives, but to tell you a matter of fact.\r\nGood-morning, Dr Grantly."\r\n\r\n"One moment,--one moment," said the other.  "I don\'t exactly\r\nappreciate the taste which induced you to make any personal\r\ncommunication to me on the subject; but I dare say I\'m wrong, I dare\r\nsay your judgment is the better of the two; but as you have done me\r\nthe honour,--as you have, as it were, forced me into a certain amount\r\nof conversation on a subject which had better, perhaps, have been left\r\nto our lawyers, you will excuse me if I ask you to hear my reply to\r\nyour communication."\r\n\r\n"I am in no hurry, Dr Grantly."\r\n\r\n"Well, I am, Mr Bold; my time is not exactly leisure time, and,\r\ntherefore, if you please, we\'ll go to the point at once:--you\'re going\r\nto abandon this lawsuit?"--and he paused for a reply.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Dr Grantly, I am."\r\n\r\n"Having exposed a gentleman who was one of your father\'s warmest\r\nfriends to all the ignominy and insolence which the press could heap\r\nupon his name, having somewhat ostentatiously declared that it was\r\nyour duty as a man of high public virtue to protect those poor old\r\nfools whom you have humbugged there at the hospital, you now find that\r\nthe game costs more than it\'s worth, and so you make up your mind to\r\nhave done with it.  A prudent resolution, Mr Bold; but it is a pity\r\nyou should have been so long coming to it.  Has it struck you that\r\nwe may not now choose to give over? that we may find it necessary to\r\npunish the injury you have done to us?  Are you aware, sir, that we\r\nhave gone to enormous expense to resist this iniquitous attempt of\r\nyours?"\r\n\r\nBold\'s face was now furiously red, and he nearly crushed his hat\r\nbetween his hands; but he said nothing.\r\n\r\n"We have found it necessary to employ the best advice that money\r\ncould procure.  Are you aware, sir, what may be the probable cost of\r\nsecuring the services of the attorney-general?"\r\n\r\n"Not in the least, Dr Grantly."\r\n\r\n"I dare say not, sir.  When you recklessly put this affair into\r\nthe hands of your friend Mr Finney, whose six-and-eightpences and\r\nthirteen-and-fourpences may, probably, not amount to a large sum, you\r\nwere indifferent as to the cost and suffering which such a proceeding\r\nmight entail on others; but are you aware, sir, that these crushing\r\ncosts must now come out of your own pocket?"\r\n\r\n"Any demand of such a nature which Mr Harding\'s lawyer may have to\r\nmake will doubtless be made to my lawyer."\r\n\r\n"\'Mr Harding\'s lawyer and my lawyer!\' Did you come here merely to\r\nrefer me to the lawyers?  Upon my word I think the honour of your\r\nvisit might have been spared!  And now, sir, I\'ll tell you what my\r\nopinion is:--my opinion is, that we shall not allow you to withdraw\r\nthis matter from the courts."\r\n\r\n"You can do as you please, Dr Grantly; good-morning."\r\n\r\n"Hear me out, sir," said the archdeacon; "I have here in my hands the\r\nlast opinion given in this matter by Sir Abraham Haphazard.  I dare\r\nsay you have already heard of this;--I dare say it has had something\r\nto do with your visit here to-day."\r\n\r\n"I know nothing whatever of Sir Abraham Haphazard or his opinion."\r\n\r\n"Be that as it may, here it is; he declares most explicitly that under\r\nno phasis of the affair whatever have you a leg to stand upon; that Mr\r\nHarding is as safe in his hospital as I am here in my rectory; that a\r\nmore futile attempt to destroy a man was never made, than this which\r\nyou have made to ruin Mr Harding.  Here," and he slapped the paper\r\non the table, "I have this opinion from the very first lawyer in the\r\nland; and under these circumstances you expect me to make you a low\r\nbow for your kind offer to release Mr Harding from the toils of your\r\nnet!  Sir, your net is not strong enough to hold him; sir, your net\r\nhas fallen to pieces, and you knew that well enough before I told\r\nyou--and now, sir, I\'ll wish you good-morning, for I\'m busy."\r\n\r\nBold was now choking with passion.  He had let the archdeacon run on\r\nbecause he knew not with what words to interrupt him; but now that he\r\nhad been so defied and insulted, he could not leave the room without\r\nsome reply.\r\n\r\n"Dr Grantly," he commenced.\r\n\r\n"I have nothing further to say or to hear," said the archdeacon.\r\n"I\'ll do myself the honour to order your horse."  And he rang the\r\nbell.\r\n\r\n"I came here, Dr Grantly, with the warmest, kindest feelings--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course you did; nobody doubts it."\r\n\r\n"With the kindest feelings;--and they have been most grossly outraged\r\nby your treatment."\r\n\r\n"Of course they have;--I have not chosen to see my father-in-law\r\nruined; what an outrage that has been to your feelings!"\r\n\r\n"The time will come, Dr Grantly, when you will understand why I called\r\nupon you to-day."\r\n\r\n"No doubt, no doubt.  Is Mr Bold\'s horse there?  That\'s right; open\r\nthe front door.  Good-morning, Mr Bold;" and the doctor stalked into\r\nhis own drawing-room, closing the door behind him, and making it quite\r\nimpossible that John Bold should speak another word.\r\n\r\nAs he got on his horse, which he was fain to do feeling like a dog\r\nturned out of a kitchen, he was again greeted by little Sammy.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Mr Bold; I hope we may have the pleasure of seeing you\r\nagain before long; I am sure papa will always be glad to see you."\r\n\r\nThat was certainly the bitterest moment in John Bold\'s life.  Not even\r\nthe remembrance of his successful love could comfort him; nay, when\r\nhe thought of Eleanor he felt that it was that very love which had\r\nbrought him to such a pass.  That he should have been so insulted,\r\nand be unable to reply!  That he should have given up so much to the\r\nrequest of a girl, and then have had his motives so misunderstood!\r\nThat he should have made so gross a mistake as this visit of his to\r\nthe archdeacon\'s!  He bit the top of his whip, till he penetrated the\r\nhorn of which it was made: he struck the poor animal in his anger, and\r\nthen was doubly angry with himself at his futile passion.  He had been\r\nso completely checkmated, so palpably overcome! and what was he to do?\r\nHe could not continue his action after pledging himself to abandon it;\r\nnor was there any revenge in that;--it was the very step to which his\r\nenemy had endeavoured to goad him!\r\n\r\nHe threw the reins to the servant who came to take his horse, and\r\nrushed upstairs into his drawing-room, where his sister Mary was\r\nsitting.\r\n\r\n"If there be a devil," said he, "a real devil here on earth, it is\r\nDr Grantly."  He vouchsafed her no further intelligence, but again\r\nseizing his hat, he rushed out, and took his departure for London\r\nwithout another word to anyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII\r\n\r\nTHE WARDEN\'S DECISION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe meeting between Eleanor and her father was not so stormy as that\r\ndescribed in the last chapter, but it was hardly more successful.  On\r\nher return from Bold\'s house she found her father in a strange state.\r\nHe was not sorrowful and silent as he had been on that memorable\r\nday when his son-in-law lectured him as to all that he owed to his\r\norder; nor was he in his usual quiet mood.  When Eleanor reached the\r\nhospital, he was walking to and fro upon the lawn, and she soon saw\r\nthat he was much excited.\r\n\r\n"I am going to London, my dear," he said as soon as he saw her.\r\n\r\n"London, papa!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear, to London; I will have this matter settled some way;\r\nthere are some things, Eleanor, which I cannot bear."\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa, what is it?" said she, leading him by the arm into the\r\nhouse.  "I had such good news for you, and now you make me fear I am\r\ntoo late."  And then, before he could let her know what had caused\r\nthis sudden resolve, or could point to the fatal paper which lay on\r\nthe table, she told him that the lawsuit was over, that Bold had\r\ncommissioned her to assure her father in his name that it would be\r\nabandoned,--that there was no further cause for misery, that the whole\r\nmatter might be looked on as though it had never been discussed.  She\r\ndid not tell him with what determined vehemence she had obtained this\r\nconcession in his favour, nor did she mention the price she was to pay\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nThe warden did not express himself peculiarly gratified at this\r\nintelligence, and Eleanor, though she had not worked for thanks, and\r\nwas by no means disposed to magnify her own good offices, felt hurt\r\nat the manner in which her news was received.  "Mr Bold can act as\r\nhe thinks proper, my love," said he; "if Mr Bold thinks he has been\r\nwrong, of course he will discontinue what he is doing; but that cannot\r\nchange my purpose."\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa!" she exclaimed, all but crying with vexation; "I thought\r\nyou would have been so happy;--I thought all would have been right\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"Mr Bold," continued he, "has set great people to work,--so great that\r\nI doubt they are now beyond his control.  Read that, my dear."  The\r\nwarden, doubling up a number of _The Jupiter_, pointed to the peculiar\r\narticle which she was to read.  It was to the last of the three\r\nleaders, which are generally furnished daily for the support of the\r\nnation, that Mr Harding directed her attention.  It dealt some heavy\r\nblows on various clerical delinquents; on families who received their\r\ntens of thousands yearly for doing nothing; on men who, as the article\r\nstated, rolled in wealth which they had neither earned nor inherited,\r\nand which was in fact stolen from the poorer clergy.  It named some\r\nsons of bishops, and grandsons of archbishops; men great in their way,\r\nwho had redeemed their disgrace in the eyes of many by the enormity of\r\ntheir plunder; and then, having disposed of these leviathans, it\r\ndescended to Mr Harding.\r\n\r\n\r\n   We alluded some weeks since to an instance of similar\r\n   injustice, though in a more humble scale, in which the warden\r\n   of an almshouse at Barchester has become possessed of the\r\n   income of the greater part of the whole institution.  Why an\r\n   almshouse should have a warden we cannot pretend to explain,\r\n   nor can we say what special need twelve old men can have for\r\n   the services of a separate clergyman, seeing that they have\r\n   twelve reserved seats for themselves in Barchester Cathedral.\r\n   But be this as it may, let the gentleman call himself warden\r\n   or precentor, or what he will, let him be never so scrupulous\r\n   in exacting religious duties from his twelve dependents, or\r\n   never so negligent as regards the services of the cathedral,\r\n   it appears palpably clear that he can be entitled to no\r\n   portion of the revenue of the hospital, excepting that which\r\n   the founder set apart for him; and it is equally clear that\r\n   the founder did not intend that three-fifths of his charity\r\n   should be so consumed.\r\n\r\n   The case is certainly a paltry one after the tens of\r\n   thousands with which we have been dealing, for the warden\'s\r\n   income is after all but a poor eight hundred a year: eight\r\n   hundred a year is not magnificent preferment of itself, and\r\n   the warden may, for anything we know, be worth much more to\r\n   the church; but if so, let the church pay him out of funds\r\n   justly at its own disposal.\r\n\r\n   We allude to the question of the Barchester almshouse at the\r\n   present moment, because we understand that a plea has been\r\n   set up which will be peculiarly revolting to the minds of\r\n   English churchmen.  An action has been taken against Mr\r\n   Warden Harding, on behalf of the almsmen, by a gentleman\r\n   acting solely on public grounds, and it is to be argued that\r\n   Mr Harding takes nothing but what he received as a servant of\r\n   the hospital, and that he is not himself responsible for the\r\n   amount of stipend given to him for his work.  Such a plea\r\n   would doubtless be fair, if anyone questioned the daily wages\r\n   of a bricklayer employed on the building, or the fee of the\r\n   charwoman who cleans it; but we cannot envy the feeling of a\r\n   clergyman of the Church of England who could allow such an\r\n   argument to be put in his mouth.\r\n\r\n   If this plea be put forward we trust Mr Harding will be\r\n   forced as a witness to state the nature of his employment;\r\n   the amount of work that he does; the income which he\r\n   receives; and the source from whence he obtained his\r\n   appointment.  We do not think he will receive much public\r\n   sympathy to atone for the annoyance of such an examination.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Eleanor read the article her face flushed with indignation, and\r\nwhen she had finished it, she almost feared to look up at her father.\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear," said he, "what do you think of that;--is it worth\r\nwhile to be a warden at that price?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa;--dear papa!"\r\n\r\n"Mr Bold can\'t un-write that, my dear;--Mr Bold can\'t say that that\r\nsha\'n\'t be read by every clergyman at Oxford; nay, by every gentleman\r\nin the land;" and then he walked up and down the room, while Eleanor\r\nin mute despair followed him with her eyes.  "And I\'ll tell you what,\r\nmy dear," he continued, speaking now very calmly, and in a forced\r\nmanner very unlike himself; "Mr Bold can\'t dispute the truth of every\r\nword in that article you have just read--nor can I."  Eleanor stared\r\nat him, as though she scarcely understood the words he was speaking.\r\n"Nor can I, Eleanor: that\'s the worst of all, or would be so if\r\nthere were no remedy.  I have thought much of all this since we were\r\ntogether last night;" and he came and sat beside her, and put his arm\r\nround her waist as he had done then.  "I have thought much of what the\r\narchdeacon has said, and of what this paper says; and I do believe I\r\nhave no right to be here."\r\n\r\n"No right to be warden of the hospital, papa?"\r\n\r\n"No right to be warden with eight hundred a year; no right to be\r\nwarden with such a house as this; no right to spend in luxury money\r\nthat was intended for charity.  Mr Bold may do as he pleases about his\r\nsuit, but I hope he will not abandon it for my sake."\r\n\r\nPoor Eleanor! this was hard upon her.  Was it for this she had made\r\nher great resolve!  For this that she had laid aside her quiet\r\ndemeanour, and taken upon her the rants of a tragedy heroine!  One\r\nmay work and not for thanks, but yet feel hurt at not receiving them;\r\nand so it was with Eleanor: one may be disinterested in one\'s good\r\nactions, and yet feel discontented that they are not recognised.\r\nCharity may be given with the left hand so privily that the right hand\r\ndoes not know it, and yet the left hand may regret to feel that it has\r\nno immediate reward.  Eleanor had had no wish to burden her father\r\nwith a weight of obligation, and yet she had looked forward to much\r\ndelight from the knowledge that she had freed him from his sorrows:\r\nnow such hopes were entirely over: all that she had done was of no\r\navail; she had humbled herself to Bold in vain; the evil was utterly\r\nbeyond her power to cure!\r\n\r\nShe had thought also how gently she would whisper to her father all\r\nthat her lover had said to her about herself, and how impossible she\r\nhad found it to reject him: and then she had anticipated her father\'s\r\nkindly kiss and close embrace as he gave his sanction to her love.\r\nAlas! she could say nothing of this now.  In speaking of Mr Bold, her\r\nfather put him aside as one whose thoughts and sayings and acts could\r\nbe of no moment.  Gentle reader, did you ever feel yourself snubbed?\r\nDid you ever, when thinking much of your own importance, find yourself\r\nsuddenly reduced to a nonentity?  Such was Eleanor\'s feeling now.\r\n\r\n"They shall not put forward this plea on my behalf," continued the\r\nwarden.  "Whatever may be the truth of the matter, that at any rate is\r\nnot true; and the man who wrote that article is right in saying that\r\nsuch a plea is revolting to an honest mind.  I will go up to London,\r\nmy dear, and see these lawyers myself, and if no better excuse can be\r\nmade for me than that, I and the hospital will part."\r\n\r\n"But the archdeacon, papa?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help it, my dear; there are some things which a man cannot\r\nbear:--I cannot bear that;" and he put his hand upon the newspaper.\r\n\r\n"But will the archdeacon go with you?"\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, Mr Harding had made up his mind to steal a march\r\nupon the archdeacon.  He was aware that he could take no steps without\r\ninforming his dread son-in-law, but he had resolved that he would send\r\nout a note to Plumstead Episcopi detailing his plans, but that the\r\nmessenger should not leave Barchester till he himself had started\r\nfor London; so that he might be a day before the doctor, who, he had\r\nno doubt, would follow him.  In that day, if he had luck, he might\r\narrange it all; he might explain to Sir Abraham that he, as warden,\r\nwould have nothing further to do with the defence about to be set up;\r\nhe might send in his official resignation to his friend the bishop,\r\nand so make public the whole transaction, that even the doctor would\r\nnot be able to undo what he had done.  He knew too well the doctor\'s\r\nstrength and his own weakness to suppose he could do this, if they\r\nboth reached London together; indeed, he would never be able to get to\r\nLondon, if the doctor knew of his intended journey in time to prevent\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"No, I think not," said he.  "I think I shall start before the\r\narchdeacon could be ready;--I shall go early to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\n"That will be best, papa," said Eleanor, showing that her father\'s\r\nruse was appreciated.\r\n\r\n"Why yes, my love.  The fact is, I wish to do all this before the\r\narchdeacon can--can interfere.  There is a great deal of truth in\r\nall he says;--he argues very well, and I can\'t always answer him;\r\nbut there is an old saying, Nelly: \'Everyone knows where his own\r\nshoe pinches!\'  He\'ll say that I want moral courage, and strength of\r\ncharacter, and power of endurance, and it\'s all true; but I\'m sure I\r\nought not to remain here, if I have nothing better to put forward than\r\na quibble: so, Nelly, we shall have to leave this pretty place."\r\n\r\nEleanor\'s face brightened up, as she assured her father how cordially\r\nshe agreed with him.\r\n\r\n"True, my love," said he, now again quite happy and at ease in his\r\nmanner.  "What good to us is this place or all the money, if we are to\r\nbe ill-spoken of?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa, I am so glad!"\r\n\r\n"My darling child!  It did cost me a pang at first, Nelly, to think\r\nthat you should lose your pretty drawing-room, and your ponies, and\r\nyour garden: the garden will be the worst of all;--but there is a\r\ngarden at Crabtree, a very pretty garden."\r\n\r\nCrabtree Parva was the name of the small living which Mr Harding had\r\nheld as a minor canon, and which still belonged to him.  It was only\r\nworth some eighty pounds a year, and a small house and glebe, all\r\nof which were now handed over to Mr Harding\'s curate; but it was to\r\nCrabtree glebe that Mr Harding thought of retiring.  This parish must\r\nnot be mistaken for that other living, Crabtree Canonicorum, as it is\r\ncalled.  Crabtree Canonicorum is a very nice thing; there are only two\r\nhundred parishioners; there are four hundred acres of glebe; and the\r\ngreat and small tithes, which both go to the rector, are worth four\r\nhundred pounds a year more.  Crabtree Canonicorum is in the gift of\r\nthe dean and chapter, and is at this time possessed by the Honourable\r\nand Reverend Dr Vesey Stanhope, who also fills the prebendal stall\r\nof Goosegorge in Barchester Chapter, and holds the united rectory of\r\nEiderdown and Stogpingum, or Stoke Pinquium, as it should be written.\r\nThis is the same Dr Vesey Stanhope whose hospitable villa on the Lake\r\nof Como is so well known to the _\xe9lite_ of English travellers, and\r\nwhose collection of Lombard butterflies is supposed to be unique.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the warden, musing, "there is a very pretty garden at\r\nCrabtree;--but I shall be sorry to disturb poor Smith." Smith was the\r\ncurate of Crabtree, a gentleman who was maintaining a wife and half a\r\ndozen children on the income arising from his profession.\r\n\r\nEleanor assured her father that, as far as she was concerned, she\r\ncould leave her house and her ponies without a single regret.  She was\r\nonly so happy that he was going--going where he would escape all this\r\ndreadful turmoil.\r\n\r\n"But we will take the music, my dear."\r\n\r\nAnd so they went on planning their future happiness, and plotting how\r\nthey would arrange it all without the interposition of the archdeacon,\r\nand at last they again became confidential, and then the warden did\r\nthank her for what she had done, and Eleanor, lying on her father\'s\r\nshoulder, did find an opportunity to tell her secret: and the father\r\ngave his blessing to his child, and said that the man whom she\r\nloved was honest, good, and kind-hearted, and right-thinking in the\r\nmain,--one who wanted only a good wife to put him quite upright,--"a\r\nman, my love," he ended by saying, "to whom I firmly believe that I\r\ncan trust my treasure with safety."\r\n\r\n"But what will Dr Grantly say?"\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear, it can\'t be helped;--we shall be out at Crabtree\r\nthen."\r\n\r\nAnd Eleanor ran upstairs to prepare her father\'s clothes for his\r\njourney; and the warden returned to his garden to make his last adieux\r\nto every tree, and shrub, and shady nook that he knew so well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV\r\n\r\nMOUNT OLYMPUS\r\n\r\n\r\nWretched in spirit, groaning under the feeling of insult,\r\nself-condemning, and ill-satisfied in every way, Bold returned to\r\nhis London lodgings.  Ill as he had fared in his interview with the\r\narchdeacon, he was not the less under the necessity of carrying out\r\nhis pledge to Eleanor; and he went about his ungracious task with a\r\nheavy heart.\r\n\r\nThe attorneys whom he had employed in London received his instructions\r\nwith surprise and evident misgiving; however, they could only obey,\r\nand mutter something of their sorrow that such heavy costs should\r\nonly fall upon their own employer,--especially as nothing was wanting\r\nbut perseverance to throw them on the opposite party.  Bold left the\r\noffice which he had latterly so much frequented, shaking the dust from\r\noff his feet; and before he was down the stairs, an edict had already\r\ngone forth for the preparation of the bill.\r\n\r\nHe next thought of the newspapers.  The case had been taken up by more\r\nthan one; and he was well aware that the keynote had been sounded by\r\n_The Jupiter_.  He had been very intimate with Tom Towers, and had\r\noften discussed with him the affairs of the hospital.  Bold could\r\nnot say that the articles in that paper had been written at his own\r\ninstigation.  He did not even know, as a fact, that they had been\r\nwritten by his friend.  Tom Towers had never said that such a view of\r\nthe case, or such a side in the dispute, would be taken by the paper\r\nwith which he was connected.  Very discreet in such matters was Tom\r\nTowers, and altogether indisposed to talk loosely of the concerns\r\nof that mighty engine of which it was his high privilege to move\r\nin secret some portion.  Nevertheless Bold believed that to him\r\nwere owing those dreadful words which had caused such panic at\r\nBarchester,--and he conceived himself bound to prevent their\r\nrepetition.  With this view he betook himself from the attorneys\'\r\noffice to that laboratory where, with amazing chemistry, Tom Towers\r\ncompounded thunderbolts for the destruction of all that is evil, and\r\nfor the furtherance of all that is good, in this and other\r\nhemispheres.\r\n\r\nWho has not heard of Mount Olympus,--that high abode of all the powers\r\nof type, that favoured seat of the great goddess Pica, that wondrous\r\nhabitation of gods and devils, from whence, with ceaseless hum of\r\nsteam and never-ending flow of Castalian ink, issue forth fifty\r\nthousand nightly edicts for the governance of a subject nation?\r\n\r\nVelvet and gilding do not make a throne, nor gold and jewels a\r\nsceptre.  It is a throne because the most exalted one sits there,--and\r\na sceptre because the most mighty one wields it.  So it is with Mount\r\nOlympus.  Should a stranger make his way thither at dull noonday, or\r\nduring the sleepy hours of the silent afternoon, he would find no\r\nacknowledged temple of power and beauty, no fitting fane for the\r\ngreat Thunderer, no proud fa\xe7ades and pillared roofs to support\r\nthe dignity of this greatest of earthly potentates.  To the\r\noutward and uninitiated eye, Mount Olympus is a somewhat humble\r\nspot,--undistinguished, unadorned,--nay, almost mean.  It stands\r\nalone, as it were, in a mighty city, close to the densest throng\r\nof men, but partaking neither of the noise nor the crowd; a small\r\nsecluded, dreary spot, tenanted, one would say, by quite unambitious\r\npeople at the easiest rents.  "Is this Mount Olympus?" asks the\r\nunbelieving stranger.  "Is it from these small, dark, dingy buildings\r\nthat those infallible laws proceed which cabinets are called upon to\r\nobey; by which bishops are to be guided, lords and commons controlled,\r\njudges instructed in law, generals in strategy, admirals in naval\r\ntactics, and orange-women in the management of their barrows?"\r\n"Yes, my friend--from these walls.  From here issue the only known\r\ninfallible bulls for the guidance of British souls and bodies.\r\nThis little court is the Vatican of England.  Here reigns a\r\npope, self-nominated, self-consecrated,--ay, and much stranger\r\ntoo,--self-believing!--a pope whom, if you cannot obey him, I would\r\nadvise you to disobey as silently as possible; a pope hitherto afraid\r\nof no Luther; a pope who manages his own inquisition, who punishes\r\nunbelievers as no most skilful inquisitor of Spain ever dreamt of\r\ndoing;--one who can excommunicate thoroughly, fearfully, radically;\r\nput you beyond the pale of men\'s charity; make you odious to your\r\ndearest friends, and turn you into a monster to be pointed at by the\r\nfinger!"  Oh heavens! and this is Mount Olympus!\r\n\r\nIt is a fact amazing to ordinary mortals that _The Jupiter_ is never\r\nwrong.  With what endless care, with what unsparing labour, do we not\r\nstrive to get together for our great national council the men most\r\nfitting to compose it.  And how we fail! Parliament is always wrong:\r\nlook at _The Jupiter_, and see how futile are their meetings, how vain\r\ntheir council, how needless all their trouble!  With what pride do we\r\nregard our chief ministers, the great servants of state, the oligarchs\r\nof the nation on whose wisdom we lean, to whom we look for guidance in\r\nour difficulties!  But what are they to the writers of _The Jupiter_?\r\nThey hold council together and with anxious thought painfully\r\nelaborate their country\'s good; but when all is done, _The Jupiter_\r\ndeclares that all is naught.  Why should we look to Lord John\r\nRussell;--why should we regard Palmerston and Gladstone, when Tom\r\nTowers without a struggle can put us right?  Look at our generals,\r\nwhat faults they make; at our admirals, how inactive they are.  What\r\nmoney, honesty, and science can do, is done; and yet how badly are our\r\ntroops brought together, fed, conveyed, clothed, armed, and managed.\r\nThe most excellent of our good men do their best to man our ships,\r\nwith the assistance of all possible external appliances; but in vain.\r\nAll, all is wrong--alas! alas!  Tom Towers, and he alone, knows all\r\nabout it.  Why, oh why, ye earthly ministers, why have ye not followed\r\nmore closely this heaven-sent messenger that is among us?\r\n\r\nWere it not well for us in our ignorance that we confided all things\r\nto _The Jupiter_?  Would it not be wise in us to abandon useless\r\ntalking, idle thinking, and profitless labour?  Away with majorities\r\nin the House of Commons, with verdicts from judicial bench given after\r\nmuch delay, with doubtful laws, and the fallible attempts of humanity!\r\nDoes not _The Jupiter_, coming forth daily with fifty thousand\r\nimpressions full of unerring decision on every mortal subject, set all\r\nmatters sufficiently at rest?  Is not Tom Towers here, able to guide\r\nus and willing?\r\n\r\nYes indeed, able and willing to guide all men in all things, so\r\nlong as he is obeyed as autocrat should be obeyed,--with undoubting\r\nsubmission: only let not ungrateful ministers seek other colleagues\r\nthan those whom Tom Towers may approve; let church and state, law and\r\nphysic, commerce and agriculture, the arts of war, and the arts of\r\npeace, all listen and obey, and all will be made perfect.  Has not Tom\r\nTowers an all-seeing eye?  From the diggings of Australia to those of\r\nCalifornia, right round the habitable globe, does he not know, watch,\r\nand chronicle the doings of everyone?  From a bishopric in New Zealand\r\nto an unfortunate director of a North-west passage, is he not the only\r\nfit judge of capability?  From the sewers of London to the Central\r\nRailway of India,--from the palaces of St Petersburg to the cabins of\r\nConnaught, nothing can escape him.  Britons have but to read, to obey,\r\nand be blessed.  None but the fools doubt the wisdom of _The Jupiter_;\r\nnone but the mad dispute its facts.\r\n\r\nNo established religion has ever been without its unbelievers, even\r\nin the country where it is the most firmly fixed; no creed has been\r\nwithout scoffers; no church has so prospered as to free itself\r\nentirely from dissent.  There are those who doubt _The Jupiter_!\r\nThey live and breathe the upper air, walking here unscathed, though\r\nscorned,--men, born of British mothers and nursed on English milk, who\r\nscruple not to say that Mount Olympus has its price, that Tom Towers\r\ncan be bought for gold!\r\n\r\nSuch is Mount Olympus, the mouthpiece of all the wisdom of this great\r\ncountry.  It may probably be said that no place in this 19th century\r\nis more worthy of notice.  No treasury mandate armed with the\r\nsignatures of all the government has half the power of one of those\r\nbroad sheets, which fly forth from hence so abundantly, armed with no\r\nsignature at all.\r\n\r\nSome great man, some mighty peer,--we\'ll say a noble duke,--retires to\r\nrest feared and honoured by all his countrymen,--fearless himself; if\r\nnot a good man, at any rate a mighty man,--too mighty to care much\r\nwhat men may say about his want of virtue.  He rises in the morning\r\ndegraded, mean, and miserable; an object of men\'s scorn, anxious only\r\nto retire as quickly as may be to some German obscurity, some unseen\r\nItalian privacy, or indeed, anywhere out of sight.  What has made this\r\nawful change? what has so afflicted him?  An article has appeared in\r\n_The Jupiter_; some fifty lines of a narrow column have destroyed all\r\nhis grace\'s equanimity, and banished him for ever from the world.\r\nNo man knows who wrote the bitter words; the clubs talk confusedly of\r\nthe matter, whispering to each other this and that name; while Tom\r\nTowers walks quietly along Pall Mall, with his coat buttoned close\r\nagainst the east wind, as though he were a mortal man, and not a god\r\ndispensing thunderbolts from Mount Olympus.\r\n\r\nIt was not to Mount Olympus that our friend Bold betook himself.  He\r\nhad before now wandered round that lonely spot, thinking how grand a\r\nthing it was to write articles for _The Jupiter_; considering within\r\nhimself whether by any stretch of the powers within him he could ever\r\ncome to such distinction; wondering how Tom Towers would take any\r\nlittle humble offering of his talents; calculating that Tom Towers\r\nhimself must have once had a beginning, have once doubted as to\r\nhis own success.  Towers could not have been born a writer in _The\r\nJupiter_.  With such ideas, half ambitious and half awe-struck, had\r\nBold regarded the silent-looking workshop of the gods; but he had\r\nnever yet by word or sign attempted to influence the slightest word\r\nof his unerring friend.  On such a course was he now intent; and not\r\nwithout much inward palpitation did he betake himself to the quiet\r\nabode of wisdom, where Tom Towers was to be found o\' mornings inhaling\r\nambrosia and sipping nectar in the shape of toast and tea.\r\n\r\nNot far removed from Mount Olympus, but somewhat nearer to the blessed\r\nregions of the West, is the most favoured abode of Themis.  Washed by\r\nthe rich tide which now passes from the towers of C\xe6sar to Barry\'s\r\nhalls of eloquence; and again back, with new offerings of a city\'s\r\ntribute, from the palaces of peers to the mart of merchants, stand\r\nthose quiet walls which Law has delighted to honour by its presence.\r\nWhat a world within a world is the Temple! how quiet are its\r\n"entangled walks," as someone lately has called them, and yet how\r\nclose to the densest concourse of humanity! how gravely respectable\r\nits sober alleys, though removed but by a single step from the\r\nprofanity of the Strand and the low iniquity of Fleet Street!  Old\r\nSt Dunstan, with its bell-smiting bludgeoners, has been removed; the\r\nancient shops with their faces full of pleasant history are passing\r\naway one by one; the bar itself is to go--its doom has been pronounced\r\nby _The Jupiter_; rumour tells us of some huge building that is to\r\nappear in these latitudes dedicated to law, subversive of the courts\r\nof Westminster, and antagonistic to the Rolls and Lincoln\'s Inn; but\r\nnothing yet threatens the silent beauty of the Temple: it is the\r\nmedi\xe6val court of the metropolis.\r\n\r\nHere, on the choicest spot of this choice ground, stands a lofty row\r\nof chambers, looking obliquely upon the sullied Thames; before the\r\nwindows, the lawn of the Temple Gardens stretches with that dim yet\r\ndelicious verdure so refreshing to the eyes of Londoners.  If doomed\r\nto live within the thickest of London smoke you would surely say that\r\nthat would be your chosen spot.  Yes, you, you whom I now address, my\r\ndear, middle-aged bachelor friend, can nowhere be so well domiciled\r\nas here.  No one here will ask whether you are out or at home; alone\r\nor with friends; here no Sabbatarian will investigate your Sundays,\r\nno censorious landlady will scrutinise your empty bottle, no\r\nvaletudinarian neighbour will complain of late hours.  If you love\r\nbooks, to what place are books so suitable?  The whole spot is\r\nredolent of typography.  Would you worship the Paphian goddess, the\r\ngroves of Cyprus are not more taciturn than those of the Temple.\r\nWit and wine are always here, and always together; the revels of the\r\nTemple are as those of polished Greece, where the wildest worshipper\r\nof Bacchus never forgot the dignity of the god whom he adored. Where\r\ncan retirement be so complete as here? where can you be so sure of all\r\nthe pleasures of society?\r\n\r\nIt was here that Tom Towers lived, and cultivated with eminent success\r\nthe tenth Muse who now governs the periodical press.  But let it not\r\nbe supposed that his chambers were such, or so comfortless, as are\r\nfrequently the gaunt abodes of legal aspirants.  Four chairs, a\r\nhalf-filled deal book-case with hangings of dingy green baize, an old\r\noffice table covered with dusty papers, which are not moved once in\r\nsix months, and an older Pembroke brother with rickety legs, for all\r\ndaily uses; a despatcher for the preparation of lobsters and coffee,\r\nand an apparatus for the cooking of toast and mutton chops; such\r\nutensils and luxuries as these did not suffice for the well-being of\r\nTom Towers.  He indulged in four rooms on the first floor, each of\r\nwhich was furnished, if not with the splendour, with probably more\r\nthan the comfort of Stafford House.  Every addition that science\r\nand art have lately made to the luxuries of modern life was to be\r\nfound there.  The room in which he usually sat was surrounded by\r\nbook-shelves carefully filled; nor was there a volume there which was\r\nnot entitled to its place in such a collection, both by its intrinsic\r\nworth and exterior splendour: a pretty portable set of steps in one\r\ncorner of the room showed that those even on the higher shelves were\r\nintended for use.  The chamber contained but two works of art:--the\r\none, an admirable bust of Sir Robert Peel, by Power, declared the\r\nindividual politics of our friend; and the other, a singularly long\r\nfigure of a female devotee, by Millais, told equally plainly the\r\nschool of art to which he was addicted.  This picture was not hung,\r\nas pictures usually are, against the wall; there was no inch of wall\r\nvacant for such a purpose: it had a stand or desk erected for its own\r\naccommodation; and there on her pedestal, framed and glazed, stood\r\nthe devotional lady looking intently at a lily as no lady ever looked\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nOur modern artists, whom we style Pre-Raphaelites, have delighted\r\nto go back, not only to the finish and peculiar manner, but also to\r\nthe subjects of the early painters.  It is impossible to give them\r\ntoo much praise for the elaborate perseverance with which they have\r\nequalled the minute perfections of the masters from whom they take\r\ntheir inspiration: nothing probably can exceed the painting of some of\r\nthese latter-day pictures.  It is, however, singular into what faults\r\nthey fall as regards their subjects: they are not quite content to\r\ntake the old stock groups,--a Sebastian with his arrows, a Lucia with\r\nher eyes in a dish, a Lorenzo with a gridiron, or the Virgin with two\r\nchildren.  But they are anything but happy in their change.  As a\r\nrule, no figure should be drawn in a position which it is impossible\r\nto suppose any figure should maintain.  The patient endurance of St\r\nSebastian, the wild ecstasy of St John in the Wilderness, the maternal\r\nlove of the Virgin, are feelings naturally portrayed by a fixed\r\nposture; but the lady with the stiff back and bent neck, who looks at\r\nher flower, and is still looking from hour to hour, gives us an idea\r\nof pain without grace, and abstraction without a cause.\r\n\r\nIt was easy, from his rooms, to see that Tom Towers was a Sybarite,\r\nthough by no means an idle one.  He was lingering over his last cup of\r\ntea, surrounded by an ocean of newspapers, through which he had been\r\nswimming, when John Bold\'s card was brought in by his tiger.  This\r\ntiger never knew that his master was at home, though he often knew\r\nthat he was not, and thus Tom Towers was never invaded but by his\r\nown consent.  On this occasion, after twisting the card twice in his\r\nfingers, he signified to his attendant imp that he was visible; and\r\nthe inner door was unbolted, and our friend announced.\r\n\r\nI have before said that he of _The Jupiter_ and John Bold were\r\nintimate.  There was no very great difference in their ages, for\r\nTowers was still considerably under forty; and when Bold had been\r\nattending the London hospitals, Towers, who was not then the great man\r\nthat he had since become, had been much with him.  Then they had often\r\ndiscussed together the objects of their ambition and future prospects;\r\nthen Tom Towers was struggling hard to maintain himself, as a\r\nbriefless barrister, by shorthand reporting for any of the papers that\r\nwould engage him; then he had not dared to dream of writing leaders\r\nfor _The Jupiter_, or canvassing the conduct of Cabinet ministers.\r\nThings had altered since that time: the briefless barrister was still\r\nbriefless, but he now despised briefs: could he have been sure of a\r\njudge\'s seat, he would hardly have left his present career.  It is\r\ntrue he wore no ermine, bore no outward marks of a world\'s respect;\r\nbut with what a load of inward importance was he charged!  It is true\r\nhis name appeared in no large capitals; on no wall was chalked up "Tom\r\nTowers for ever;"--"Freedom of the Press and Tom Towers;" but what\r\nmember of Parliament had half his power?  It is true that in far-off\r\nprovinces men did not talk daily of Tom Towers but they read _The\r\nJupiter_, and acknowledged that without _The Jupiter_ life was not\r\nworth having.  This kind of hidden but still conscious glory suited\r\nthe nature of the man.  He loved to sit silent in a corner of his club\r\nand listen to the loud chattering of politicians, and to think how\r\nthey all were in his power;--how he could smite the loudest of them,\r\nwere it worth his while to raise his pen for such a purpose.  He loved\r\nto watch the great men of whom he daily wrote, and flatter himself\r\nthat he was greater than any of them.  Each of them was responsible to\r\nhis country, each of them must answer if inquired into, each of them\r\nmust endure abuse with good humour, and insolence without anger.  But\r\nto whom was he, Tom Towers, responsible?  No one could insult him;\r\nno one could inquire into him.  He could speak out withering words,\r\nand no one could answer him: ministers courted him, though perhaps\r\nthey knew not his name; bishops feared him; judges doubted their own\r\nverdicts unless he confirmed them; and generals, in their councils of\r\nwar, did not consider more deeply what the enemy would do, than what\r\n_The Jupiter_ would say. Tom Towers never boasted of _The Jupiter_;\r\nhe scarcely ever named the paper even to the most intimate of his\r\nfriends; he did not even wish to be spoken of as connected with it;\r\nbut he did not the less value his privileges, or think the less of his\r\nown importance.  It is probable that Tom Towers considered himself\r\nthe most powerful man in Europe; and so he walked on from day to day,\r\nstudiously striving to look a man, but knowing within his breast that\r\nhe was a god.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV\r\n\r\nTOM TOWERS, DR ANTICANT, AND MR SENTIMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n"Ah, Bold! how are you?  You haven\'t breakfasted?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, hours ago.  And how are you?"\r\n\r\nWhen one Esquimau meets another, do the two, as an invariable rule,\r\nask after each other\'s health? is it inherent in all human nature to\r\nmake this obliging inquiry?  Did any reader of this tale ever meet\r\nany friend or acquaintance without asking some such question, and did\r\nanyone ever listen to the reply?  Sometimes a studiously courteous\r\nquestioner will show so much thought in the matter as to answer it\r\nhimself, by declaring that had he looked at you he needn\'t have asked;\r\nmeaning thereby to signify that you are an absolute personification of\r\nhealth: but such persons are only those who premeditate small effects.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you\'re busy?" inquired Bold.\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, rather;--or I should say rather not.  If I have a leisure\r\nhour in the day, this is it."\r\n\r\n"I want to ask you if you can oblige me in a certain matter."\r\n\r\nTowers understood in a moment, from the tone of his friend\'s voice,\r\nthat the certain matter referred to the newspaper.  He smiled, and\r\nnodded his head, but made no promise.\r\n\r\n"You know this lawsuit that I\'ve been engaged in," said Bold.\r\n\r\nTom Towers intimated that he was aware of the action which was pending\r\nabout the hospital.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ve abandoned it."\r\n\r\nTom Towers merely raised his eyebrows, thrust his hands into his\r\ntrowsers pockets, and waited for his friend to proceed.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ve given it up.  I needn\'t trouble you with all the history;\r\nbut the fact is that the conduct of Mr Harding--Mr Harding is the--"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, the master of the place; the man who takes all the money and\r\ndoes nothing," said Tom Towers, interrupting him.\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know about that; but his conduct in the matter has been\r\nso excellent, so little selfish, so open, that I cannot proceed in the\r\nmatter to his detriment."  Bold\'s heart misgave him as to Eleanor as\r\nhe said this; and yet he felt that what he said was not untrue.  "I\r\nthink nothing should now be done till the wardenship be vacant."\r\n\r\n"And be again filled," said Towers, "as it certainly would, before\r\nanyone heard of the vacancy; and the same objection would again exist.\r\nIt\'s an old story, that of the vested rights of the incumbent; but\r\nsuppose the incumbent has only a vested wrong, and that the poor of\r\nthe town have a vested right, if they only knew how to get at it: is\r\nnot that something the case here?"\r\n\r\nBold couldn\'t deny it, but thought it was one of those cases which\r\nrequired a good deal of management before any real good could be done.\r\nIt was a pity that he had not considered this before he crept into the\r\nlion\'s mouth, in the shape of an attorney\'s office.\r\n\r\n"It will cost you a good deal, I fear," said Towers.\r\n\r\n"A few hundreds," said Bold--"perhaps three hundred; I can\'t help\r\nthat, and am prepared for it."\r\n\r\n"That\'s philosophical.  It\'s quite refreshing to hear a man talking of\r\nhis hundreds in so purely indifferent a manner.  But I\'m sorry you are\r\ngiving the matter up.  It injures a man to commence a thing of this\r\nkind, and not carry it through.  Have you seen that?" and he threw\r\na small pamphlet across the table, which was all but damp from the\r\npress.\r\n\r\nBold had not seen it nor heard of it; but he was well acquainted with\r\nthe author of it,--a gentleman whose pamphlets, condemnatory of all\r\nthings in these modern days, had been a good deal talked about of\r\nlate.\r\n\r\nDr Pessimist Anticant was a Scotchman, who had passed a great portion\r\nof his early days in Germany; he had studied there with much effect,\r\nand had learnt to look with German subtilty into the root of things,\r\nand to examine for himself their intrinsic worth and worthlessness.\r\nNo man ever resolved more bravely than he to accept as good nothing\r\nthat was evil; to banish from him as evil nothing that was good.  \'Tis\r\na pity that he should not have recognised the fact, that in this world\r\nno good is unalloyed, and that there is but little evil that has not\r\nin it some seed of what is goodly.\r\n\r\nReturning from Germany, he had astonished the reading public by the\r\nvigour of his thoughts, put forth in the quaintest language.  He\r\ncannot write English, said the critics.  No matter, said the public;\r\nwe can read what he does write, and that without yawning.  And so Dr\r\nPessimist Anticant became popular.  Popularity spoilt him for all\r\nfurther real use, as it has done many another.  While, with some\r\ndiffidence, he confined his objurgations to the occasional follies or\r\nshortcomings of mankind; while he ridiculed the energy of the squire\r\ndevoted to the slaughter of partridges, or the mistake of some noble\r\npatron who turned a poet into a gauger of beer-barrels, it was all\r\nwell; we were glad to be told our faults and to look forward to the\r\ncoming millennium, when all men, having sufficiently studied the works\r\nof Dr Anticant, would become truthful and energetic.  But the doctor\r\nmistook the signs of the times and the minds of men, instituted\r\nhimself censor of things in general, and began the great task of\r\nreprobating everything and everybody, without further promise of any\r\nmillennium at all.  This was not so well; and, to tell the truth, our\r\nauthor did not succeed in his undertaking.  His theories were all\r\nbeautiful, and the code of morals that he taught us certainly an\r\nimprovement on the practices of the age.  We all of us could, and many\r\nof us did, learn much from the doctor while he chose to remain vague,\r\nmysterious, and cloudy: but when he became practical, the charm was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nHis allusion to the poet and the partridges was received very well.\r\n"Oh, my poor brother," said he, "slaughtered partridges a score of\r\nbrace to each gun, and poets gauging ale-barrels, with sixty pounds a\r\nyear, at Dumfries, are not the signs of a great era!--perhaps of the\r\nsmallest possible era yet written of.  Whatever economies we pursue,\r\npolitical or other, let us see at once that this is the maddest of the\r\nuneconomic: partridges killed by our land magnates at, shall we say,\r\na guinea a head, to be retailed in Leadenhall at one shilling and\r\nninepence, with one poacher in limbo for every fifty birds! our poet,\r\nmaker, creator, gauging ale, and that badly, with no leisure for\r\nmaking or creating, only a little leisure for drinking, and such like\r\nbeer-barrel avocations!  Truly, a cutting of blocks with fine razors\r\nwhile we scrape our chins so uncomfortably with rusty knives!  Oh, my\r\npolitical economist, master of supply and demand, division of labour\r\nand high pressure--oh, my loud-speaking friend, tell me, if so much\r\nbe in you, what is the demand for poets in these kingdoms of Queen\r\nVictoria, and what the vouchsafed supply?"\r\n\r\nThis was all very well: this gave us some hope.  We might do better\r\nwith our next poet, when we got one; and though the partridges might\r\nnot be abandoned, something could perhaps be done as to the poachers.\r\nWe were unwilling, however, to take lessons in politics from so\r\nmisty a professor; and when he came to tell us that the heroes of\r\nWestminster were naught, we began to think that he had written enough.\r\nHis attack upon despatch boxes was not thought to have much in it;\r\nbut as it is short, the doctor shall again be allowed to speak his\r\nsentiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Could utmost ingenuity in the management of red tape avail\r\n   anything to men lying gasping,--we may say, all but dead;\r\n   could despatch boxes with never-so-much velvet lining and\r\n   Chubb\'s patent be of comfort to a people _in extremis_, I\r\n   also, with so many others, would, with parched tongue, call\r\n   on the name of Lord John Russell; or, my brother, at your\r\n   advice, on Lord Aberdeen; or, my cousin, on Lord Derby, at\r\n   yours; being, with my parched tongue, indifferent to such\r\n   matters.  \'Tis all one.  Oh, Derby!  Oh, Gladstone!  Oh,\r\n   Palmerston!  Oh, Lord John!  Each comes running with serene\r\n   face and despatch box.  Vain physicians! though there were\r\n   hosts of such, no despatch box will cure this disorder!\r\n   What! are there other doctors\' new names, disciples who\r\n   have not burdened their souls with tape?  Well, let us call\r\n   again.  Oh, Disraeli, great oppositionist, man of the bitter\r\n   brow! or, Oh, Molesworth, great reformer, thou who promisest\r\n   Utopia.  They come; each with that serene face, and each,--\r\n   alas, me! alas, my country!--each with a despatch box!\r\n\r\n   Oh, the serenity of Downing Street!\r\n\r\n   My brothers, when hope was over on the battle-field, when no\r\n   dimmest chance of victory remained, the ancient Roman could\r\n   hide his face within his toga, and die gracefully.  Can you\r\n   and I do so now?  If so, \'twere best for us; if not, oh my\r\n   brothers, we must die disgracefully, for hope of life and\r\n   victory I see none left to us in this world below.  I for\r\n   one cannot trust much to serene face and despatch box!\r\n\r\n\r\nThere might be truth in this, there might be depth of reasoning;\r\nbut Englishmen did not see enough in the argument to induce them\r\nto withdraw their confidence from the present arrangements of the\r\ngovernment, and Dr Anticant\'s monthly pamphlet on the decay of the\r\nworld did not receive so much attention as his earlier works.  He did\r\nnot confine himself to politics in these publications, but roamed at\r\nlarge over all matters of public interest, and found everything bad.\r\nAccording to him nobody was true, and not only nobody, but nothing; a\r\nman could not take off his hat to a lady without telling a lie;--the\r\nlady would lie again in smiling.  The ruffles of the gentleman\'s\r\nshirt would be fraught with deceit, and the lady\'s flounces full of\r\nfalsehood.  Was ever anything more severe than that attack of his on\r\nchip bonnets, or the anathemas with which he endeavoured to dust the\r\npowder out of the bishops\' wigs?\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet which Tom Towers now pushed across the table was entitled\r\n"Modern Charity," and was written with the view of proving how much in\r\nthe way of charity was done by our predecessors,--how little by the\r\npresent age; and it ended by a comparison between ancient and modern\r\ntimes, very little to the credit of the latter.\r\n\r\n"Look at this," said Towers, getting up and turning over the pages of\r\nthe pamphlet, and pointing to a passage near the end.  "Your friend\r\nthe warden, who is so little selfish, won\'t like that, I fear."  Bold\r\nread as follows--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Heavens, what a sight!  Let us with eyes wide open see the\r\n   godly man of four centuries since, the man of the dark ages;\r\n   let us see how he does his godlike work, and, again, how the\r\n   godly man of these latter days does his.\r\n\r\n   Shall we say that the former is one walking painfully\r\n   through the world, regarding, as a prudent man, his worldly\r\n   work, prospering in it as a diligent man will prosper, but\r\n   always with an eye to that better treasure to which thieves\r\n   do not creep in?  Is there not much nobility in that old\r\n   man, as, leaning on his oaken staff, he walks down the High\r\n   Street of his native town, and receives from all courteous\r\n   salutation and acknowledgment of his worth?  A noble old\r\n   man, my august inhabitants of Belgrave Square and such like\r\n   vicinity,--a very noble old man, though employed no better\r\n   than in the wholesale carding of wool.\r\n\r\n   This carding of wool, however, did in those days bring with\r\n   it much profit, so that our ancient friend, when dying,\r\n   was declared, in whatever slang then prevailed, to cut up\r\n   exceeding well.  For sons and daughters there was ample\r\n   sustenance with assistance of due industry; for friends and\r\n   relatives some relief for grief at this great loss; for aged\r\n   dependents comfort in declining years.  This was much for\r\n   one old man to get done in that dark fifteenth century.  But\r\n   this was not all: coming generations of poor wool-carders\r\n   should bless the name of this rich one; and a hospital\r\n   should be founded and endowed with his wealth for the\r\n   feeding of such of the trade as could not, by diligent\r\n   carding, any longer duly feed themselves.\r\n\r\n   \'Twas thus that an old man in the fifteenth century did his\r\n   godlike work to the best of his power, and not ignobly, as\r\n   appears to me.\r\n\r\n   We will now take our godly man of latter days.  He shall no\r\n   longer be a wool-carder, for such are not now men of mark.\r\n   We will suppose him to be one of the best of the good, one\r\n   who has lacked no opportunities.  Our old friend was, after\r\n   all, but illiterate; our modern friend shall be a man\r\n   educated in all seemly knowledge; he shall, in short, be\r\n   that blessed being,--a clergyman of the Church of England!\r\n\r\n   And now, in what perfectest manner does he in this lower\r\n   world get his godlike work done and put out of hand?\r\n   Heavens! in the strangest of manners.  Oh, my brother! in a\r\n   manner not at all to be believed, but by the most minute\r\n   testimony of eyesight.  He does it by the magnitude of his\r\n   appetite,--by the power of his gorge; his only occupation is\r\n   to swallow the bread prepared with so much anxious care for\r\n   these impoverished carders of wool,--that, and to sing\r\n   indifferently through his nose once in the week some psalm\r\n   more or less long,--the shorter the better, we should be\r\n   inclined to say.\r\n\r\n   Oh, my civilised friends!--great Britons that never will be\r\n   slaves, men advanced to infinite state of freedom and\r\n   knowledge of good and evil;--tell me, will you, what\r\n   becoming monument you will erect to an highly-educated\r\n   clergyman of the Church of England?\r\n\r\n\r\nBold certainly thought that his friend would not like that: he could\r\nnot conceive anything that he would like less than this.  To what a\r\nworld of toil and trouble had he, Bold, given rise by his indiscreet\r\nattack upon the hospital!\r\n\r\n"You see," said Towers, "that this affair has been much talked of, and\r\nthe public are with you.  I am sorry you should give the matter up.\r\nHave you seen the first number of \'The Almshouse\'?"\r\n\r\nNo; Bold had not seen "The Almshouse."  He had seen advertisements\r\nof Mr Popular Sentiment\'s new novel of that name, but had in no way\r\nconnected it with Barchester Hospital, and had never thought a moment\r\non the subject.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a direct attack on the whole system," said Towers.  "It\'ll go\r\na long way to put down Rochester, and Barchester, and Dulwich, and\r\nSt Cross, and all such hotbeds of peculation.  It\'s very clear that\r\nSentiment has been down to Barchester, and got up the whole story\r\nthere; indeed, I thought he must have had it all from you; it\'s very\r\nwell done, as you\'ll see: his first numbers always are."\r\n\r\nBold declared that Mr Sentiment had got nothing from him, and that he\r\nwas deeply grieved to find that the case had become so notorious.\r\n\r\n"The fire has gone too far to be quenched," said Towers; "the building\r\nmust go now; and as the timbers are all rotten, why, I should be\r\ninclined to say, the sooner the better.  I expected to see you get\r\nsome _\xe9clat_ in the matter."\r\n\r\nThis was all wormwood to Bold.  He had done enough to make his friend\r\nthe warden miserable for life, and had then backed out just when the\r\nsuccess of his project was sufficient to make the question one of real\r\ninterest.  How weakly he had managed his business! he had already\r\ndone the harm, and then stayed his hand when the good which he had in\r\nview was to be commenced.  How delightful would it have been to have\r\nemployed all his energy in such a cause,--to have been backed by _The\r\nJupiter_, and written up to by two of the most popular authors of the\r\nday!  The idea opened a view into the very world in which he wished\r\nto live.  To what might it not have given rise? what delightful\r\nintimacies,--what public praise,--to what Athenian banquets and rich\r\nflavour of Attic salt?\r\n\r\nThis, however, was now past hope.  He had pledged himself to abandon\r\nthe cause; and could he have forgotten the pledge, he had gone too far\r\nto retreat.  He was now, this moment, sitting in Tom Towers\' room with\r\nthe object of deprecating any further articles in _The Jupiter_, and,\r\ngreatly as he disliked the job, his petition to that effect must be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t continue it," said he, "because I found I was in the\r\nwrong."\r\n\r\nTom Towers shrugged his shoulders.  How could a successful man be in\r\nthe wrong!  "In that case," said he, "of course you must abandon it."\r\n\r\n"And I called this morning to ask you also to abandon it," said Bold.\r\n\r\n"To ask me," said Tom Towers, with the most placid of smiles, and a\r\nconsummate look of gentle surprise, as though Tom Towers was well\r\naware that he of all men was the last to meddle in such matters.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Bold, almost trembling with hesitation.  "_The Jupiter_,\r\nyou know, has taken the matter up very strongly.  Mr Harding has felt\r\nwhat it has said deeply; and I thought that if I could explain to you\r\nthat he personally has not been to blame, these articles might be\r\ndiscontinued."\r\n\r\nHow calmly impassive was Tom Towers\' face, as this innocent little\r\nproposition was made!  Had Bold addressed himself to the doorposts in\r\nMount Olympus, they would have shown as much outward sign of assent or\r\ndissent.  His quiescence was quite admirable; his discretion certainly\r\nmore than human.\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow," said he, when Bold had quite done speaking, "I\r\nreally cannot answer for _The Jupiter_."\r\n\r\n"But if you saw that these articles were unjust, I think that you\r\nwould endeavour to put a stop to them.  Of course nobody doubts that\r\nyou could, if you chose."\r\n\r\n"Nobody and everybody are always very kind, but unfortunately are\r\ngenerally very wrong."\r\n\r\n"Come, come, Towers," said Bold, plucking up his courage, and\r\nremembering that for Eleanor\'s sake he was bound to make his best\r\nexertion; "I have no doubt in my own mind but that you wrote the\r\narticles yourself, and very well written they were: it will be a great\r\nfavour if you will in future abstain from any personal allusion to\r\npoor Harding."\r\n\r\n"My dear Bold," said Tom Towers, "I have a sincere regard for you.\r\nI have known you for many years, and value your friendship; I hope\r\nyou will let me explain to you, without offence, that none who\r\nare connected with the public press can with propriety listen to\r\ninterference."\r\n\r\n"Interference!" said Bold, "I don\'t want to interfere."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but, my dear fellow, you do; what else is it?  You think that I\r\nam able to keep certain remarks out of a newspaper.  Your information\r\nis probably incorrect, as most public gossip on such subjects is; but,\r\nat any rate, you think I have such power, and you ask me to use it:\r\nnow that is interference."\r\n\r\n"Well, if you choose to call it so."\r\n\r\n"And now suppose for a moment that I had this power, and used it as\r\nyou wish: isn\'t it clear that it would be a great abuse?  Certain men\r\nare employed in writing for the public press; and if they are induced\r\neither to write or to abstain from writing by private motives,\r\nsurely the public press would soon be of little value.  Look at the\r\nrecognised worth of different newspapers, and see if it does not\r\nmainly depend on the assurance which the public feel that such a paper\r\nis, or is not, independent.  You alluded to _The Jupiter_: surely you\r\ncannot but see that the weight of _The Jupiter_ is too great to be\r\nmoved by any private request, even though it should be made to a much\r\nmore influential person than myself: you\'ve only to think of this, and\r\nyou\'ll see that I am right."\r\n\r\nThe discretion of Tom Towers was boundless: there was no contradicting\r\nwhat he said, no arguing against such propositions.  He took such high\r\nground that there was no getting on to it.  "The public is defrauded,"\r\nsaid he, "whenever private considerations are allowed to have weight."\r\nQuite true, thou greatest oracle of the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, thou sententious proclaimer of the purity of the press;--the\r\npublic is defrauded when it is purposely misled.  Poor public! how\r\noften is it misled! against what a world of fraud has it to contend!\r\n\r\nBold took his leave, and got out of the room as quickly as he could,\r\ninwardly denouncing his friend Tom Towers as a prig and a humbug.  "I\r\nknow he wrote those articles," said Bold to himself.  "I know he got\r\nhis information from me.  He was ready enough to take my word for\r\ngospel when it suited his own views, and to set Mr Harding up before\r\nthe public as an impostor on no other testimony than my chance\r\nconversation; but when I offer him real evidence opposed to his own\r\nviews, he tells me that private motives are detrimental to public\r\njustice!  Confound his arrogance!  What is any public question but a\r\nconglomeration of private interests?  What is any newspaper article\r\nbut an expression of the views taken by one side?  Truth! it takes an\r\nage to ascertain the truth of any question!  The idea of Tom Towers\r\ntalking of public motives and purity of purpose!  Why, it wouldn\'t\r\ngive him a moment\'s uneasiness to change his politics to-morrow, if\r\nthe paper required it."\r\n\r\nSuch were John Bold\'s inward exclamations as he made his way out of\r\nthe quiet labyrinth of the Temple; and yet there was no position of\r\nworldly power so coveted in Bold\'s ambition as that held by the man of\r\nwhom he was thinking.  It was the impregnability of the place which\r\nmade Bold so angry with the possessor of it, and it was the same\r\nquality which made it appear so desirable.\r\n\r\nPassing into the Strand, he saw in a bookseller\'s window an\r\nannouncement of the first number of "The Almshouse;" so he purchased a\r\ncopy, and hurrying back to his lodgings, proceeded to ascertain what\r\nMr Popular Sentiment had to say to the public on the subject which had\r\nlately occupied so much of his own attention.\r\n\r\nIn former times great objects were attained by great work. When evils\r\nwere to be reformed, reformers set about their heavy task with grave\r\ndecorum and laborious argument.  An age was occupied in proving a\r\ngrievance, and philosophical researches were printed in folio pages,\r\nwhich it took a life to write, and an eternity to read.  We get on\r\nnow with a lighter step, and quicker: ridicule is found to be more\r\nconvincing than argument, imaginary agonies touch more than true\r\nsorrows, and monthly novels convince, when learned quartos fail to\r\ndo so.  If the world is to be set right, the work will be done by\r\nshilling numbers.\r\n\r\nOf all such reformers Mr Sentiment is the most powerful.  It is\r\nincredible the number of evil practices he has put down: it is to\r\nbe feared he will soon lack subjects, and that when he has made the\r\nworking classes comfortable, and got bitter beer put into proper-sized\r\npint bottles, there will be nothing further for him left to do.  Mr\r\nSentiment is certainly a very powerful man, and perhaps not the less\r\nso that his good poor people are so very good; his hard rich people\r\nso very hard; and the genuinely honest so very honest.  Namby-pamby\r\nin these days is not thrown away if it be introduced in the proper\r\nquarters.  Divine peeresses are no longer interesting, though\r\npossessed of every virtue; but a pattern peasant or an immaculate\r\nmanufacturing hero may talk as much twaddle as one of Mrs Ratcliffe\'s\r\nheroines, and still be listened to.  Perhaps, however, Mr Sentiment\'s\r\ngreat attraction is in his second-rate characters.  If his heroes and\r\nheroines walk upon stilts, as heroes and heroines, I fear, ever must,\r\ntheir attendant satellites are as natural as though one met them in\r\nthe street: they walk and talk like men and women, and live among our\r\nfriends a rattling, lively life; yes, live, and will live till the\r\nnames of their calling shall be forgotten in their own, and Buckett\r\nand Mrs Gamp will be the only words left to us to signify a detective\r\npolice officer or a monthly nurse.\r\n\r\n"The Almshouse" opened with a scene in a clergyman\'s house. Every\r\nluxury to be purchased by wealth was described as being there: all the\r\nappearances of household indulgence generally found amongst the most\r\nself-indulgent of the rich were crowded into this abode.  Here the\r\nreader was introduced to the demon of the book, the Mephistopheles of\r\nthe drama.  What story was ever written without a demon?  What novel,\r\nwhat history, what work of any sort, what world, would be perfect\r\nwithout existing principles both of good and evil?  The demon of "The\r\nAlmshouse" was the clerical owner of this comfortable abode.  He was\r\na man well stricken in years, but still strong to do evil: he was one\r\nwho looked cruelly out of a hot, passionate, bloodshot eye; who had a\r\nhuge red nose with a carbuncle, thick lips, and a great double, flabby\r\nchin, which swelled out into solid substance, like a turkey-cock\'s\r\ncomb, when sudden anger inspired him: he had a hot, furrowed, low\r\nbrow, from which a few grizzled hairs were not yet rubbed off by\r\nthe friction of his handkerchief: he wore a loose unstarched white\r\nhandkerchief, black loose ill-made clothes, and huge loose shoes,\r\nadapted to many corns and various bunions: his husky voice told\r\ntales of much daily port wine, and his language was not so decorous\r\nas became a clergyman.  Such was the master of Mr Sentiment\'s\r\n"Almshouse."  He was a widower, but at present accompanied by two\r\ndaughters, and a thin and somewhat insipid curate.  One of the young\r\nladies was devoted to her father and the fashionable world, and she of\r\ncourse was the favourite; the other was equally addicted to Puseyism\r\nand the curate.\r\n\r\nThe second chapter of course introduced the reader to the more\r\nespecial inmates of the hospital.  Here were discovered eight old\r\nmen; and it was given to be understood that four vacancies remained\r\nunfilled, through the perverse ill-nature of the clerical gentleman\r\nwith the double chin.  The state of these eight paupers was touchingly\r\ndreadful: sixpence-farthing a day had been sufficient for their diet\r\nwhen the almshouse was founded; and on sixpence-farthing a day were\r\nthey still doomed to starve, though food was four times as dear,\r\nand money four times as plentiful.  It was shocking to find how the\r\nconversation of these eight starved old men in their dormitory shamed\r\nthat of the clergyman\'s family in his rich drawing-room.  The absolute\r\nwords they uttered were not perhaps spoken in the purest English, and\r\nit might be difficult to distinguish from their dialect to what part\r\nof the country they belonged; the beauty of the sentiment, however,\r\namply atoned for the imperfection of the language; and it was really a\r\npity that these eight old men could not be sent through the country as\r\nmoral missionaries, instead of being immured and starved in that\r\nwretched almshouse.\r\n\r\nBold finished the number; and as he threw it aside, he thought that\r\nthat at least had no direct appliance to Mr Harding, and that the\r\nabsurdly strong colouring of the picture would disenable the work from\r\ndoing either good or harm.  He was wrong.  The artist who paints for\r\nthe million must use glaring colours, as no one knew better than Mr\r\nSentiment when he described the inhabitants of his almshouse; and the\r\nradical reform which has now swept over such establishments has owed\r\nmore to the twenty numbers of Mr Sentiment\'s novel, than to all the\r\ntrue complaints which have escaped from the public for the last half\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI\r\n\r\nA LONG DAY IN LONDON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe warden had to make use of all his very moderate powers of intrigue\r\nto give his son-in-law the slip, and get out of Barchester without\r\nbeing stopped on his road.  No schoolboy ever ran away from school\r\nwith more precaution and more dread of detection; no convict, slipping\r\ndown from a prison wall, ever feared to see the gaoler more entirely\r\nthan Mr Harding did to see his son-in-law as he drove up in the pony\r\ncarriage to the railway station, on the morning of his escape to\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nThe evening before he went he wrote a note to the archdeacon,\r\nexplaining that he should start on the morrow on his journey; that\r\nit was his intention to see the attorney-general if possible, and to\r\ndecide on his future plans in accordance with what he heard from that\r\ngentleman; he excused himself for giving Dr Grantly no earlier notice,\r\nby stating that his resolve was very sudden; and having entrusted this\r\nnote to Eleanor, with the perfect, though not expressed, understanding\r\nthat it was to be sent over to Plumstead Episcopi without haste, he\r\ntook his departure.\r\n\r\nHe also prepared and carried with him a note for Sir Abraham\r\nHaphazard, in which he stated his name, explaining that he was the\r\ndefendant in the case of "The Queen on behalf of the Wool-carders of\r\nBarchester _v_. Trustees under the will of the late John Hiram," for\r\nso was the suit denominated, and begged the illustrious and learned\r\ngentleman to vouchsafe to him ten minutes\' audience at any hour on the\r\nnext day.  Mr Harding calculated that for that one day he was safe;\r\nhis son-in-law, he had no doubt, would arrive in town by an early\r\ntrain, but not early enough to reach the truant till he should have\r\nescaped from his hotel after breakfast; and could he thus manage to\r\nsee the lawyer on that very day, the deed might be done before the\r\narchdeacon could interfere.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival in town the warden drove, as was his wont, to the\r\nChapter Hotel and Coffee House, near St Paul\'s.  His visits to London\r\nof late had not been frequent; but in those happy days when "Harding\'s\r\nChurch Music" was going through the press, he had been often there;\r\nand as the publisher\'s house was in Paternoster Row, and the printer\'s\r\npress in Fleet Street, the Chapter Hotel and Coffee House had been\r\nconvenient.  It was a quiet, sombre, clerical house, beseeming such\r\na man as the warden, and thus he afterwards frequented it.  Had he\r\ndared, he would on this occasion have gone elsewhere to throw the\r\narchdeacon further off the scent; but he did not know what violent\r\nsteps his son-in-law might take for his recovery if he were not found\r\nat his usual haunt, and he deemed it not prudent to make himself the\r\nobject of a hunt through London.\r\n\r\nArrived at his inn, he ordered dinner, and went forth to the\r\nattorney-general\'s chambers.  There he learnt that Sir Abraham was in\r\nCourt, and would not probably return that day.  He would go direct\r\nfrom Court to the House; all appointments were, as a rule, made at the\r\nchambers; the clerk could by no means promise an interview for the\r\nnext day; was able, on the other hand, to say that such interview was,\r\nhe thought, impossible; but that Sir Abraham would certainly be at the\r\nHouse in the course of the night, where an answer from himself might\r\npossibly be elicited.\r\n\r\nTo the House Mr Harding went, and left his note, not finding Sir\r\nAbraham there.  He added a most piteous entreaty that he might be\r\nfavoured with an answer that evening, for which he would return.  He\r\nthen journeyed back sadly to the Chapter Coffee House, digesting his\r\ngreat thoughts, as best he might, in a clattering omnibus, wedged in\r\nbetween a wet old lady and a journeyman glazier returning from his\r\nwork with his tools in his lap.  In melancholy solitude he discussed\r\nhis mutton chop and pint of port.  What is there in this world more\r\nmelancholy than such a dinner?  A dinner, though eaten alone, in a\r\ncountry hotel may be worthy of some energy; the waiter, if you are\r\nknown, will make much of you; the landlord will make you a bow and\r\nperhaps put the fish on the table; if you ring you are attended to,\r\nand there is some life about it.  A dinner at a London eating-house is\r\nalso lively enough, if it have no other attraction.  There is plenty\r\nof noise and stir about it, and the rapid whirl of voices and rattle\r\nof dishes disperses sadness.  But a solitary dinner in an old,\r\nrespectable, sombre, solid London inn, where nothing makes any noise\r\nbut the old waiter\'s creaking shoes; where one plate slowly goes and\r\nanother slowly comes without a sound; where the two or three guests\r\nwould as soon think of knocking each other down as of speaking; where\r\nthe servants whisper, and the whole household is disturbed if an order\r\nbe given above the voice,--what can be more melancholy than a mutton\r\nchop and a pint of port in such a place?\r\n\r\nHaving gone through this Mr Harding got into another omnibus, and\r\nagain returned to the House.  Yes, Sir Abraham was there, and was\r\nthat moment on his legs, fighting eagerly for the hundred and seventh\r\nclause of the Convent Custody Bill.  Mr Harding\'s note had been\r\ndelivered to him; and if Mr Harding would wait some two or three\r\nhours, Sir Abraham could be asked whether there was any answer.\r\nThe House was not full, and perhaps Mr Harding might get admittance\r\ninto the Strangers\' Gallery, which admission, with the help of five\r\nshillings, Mr Harding was able to effect.\r\n\r\nThis bill of Sir Abraham\'s had been read a second time and passed into\r\ncommittee.  A hundred and six clauses had already been discussed and\r\nhad occupied only four mornings and five evening sittings; nine of\r\nthe hundred and six clauses were passed, fifty-five were withdrawn\r\nby consent, fourteen had been altered so as to mean the reverse of\r\nthe original proposition, eleven had been postponed for further\r\nconsideration, and seventeen had been directly negatived.  The hundred\r\nand seventh ordered the bodily searching of nuns for jesuitical\r\nsymbols by aged clergymen, and was considered to be the real mainstay\r\nof the whole bill.  No intention had ever existed to pass such a law\r\nas that proposed, but the government did not intend to abandon it\r\ntill their object was fully attained by the discussion of this clause.\r\nIt was known that it would be insisted on with terrible vehemence by\r\nProtestant Irish members, and as vehemently denounced by the Roman\r\nCatholic; and it was justly considered that no further union between\r\nthe parties would be possible after such a battle.  The innocent Irish\r\nfell into the trap as they always do, and whiskey and poplins became a\r\ndrug in the market.\r\n\r\nA florid-faced gentleman with a nice head of hair, from the south of\r\nIreland, had succeeded in catching the speaker\'s eye by the time that\r\nMr Harding had got into the gallery, and was denouncing the proposed\r\nsacrilege, his whole face glowing with a fine theatrical frenzy.\r\n\r\n"And this is a Christian country?" said he.  (Loud cheers; counter\r\ncheers from the ministerial benches.  "Some doubt as to that," from\r\na voice below the gangway.)  "No, it can be no Christian country,\r\nin which the head of the bar, the lagal adviser (loud laughter and\r\ncheers)--yes, I say the lagal adviser of the crown (great cheers and\r\nlaughter)--can stand up in his seat in this house (prolonged cheers\r\nand laughter), and attempt to lagalise indacent assaults on the bodies\r\nof religious ladies."  (Deafening cheers and laughter, which were\r\nprolonged till the honourable member resumed his seat.)\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Harding had listened to this and much more of the same kind\r\nfor about three hours, he returned to the door of the House, and\r\nreceived back from the messenger his own note, with the following\r\nwords scrawled in pencil on the back of it: "To-morrow, 10 P.M.--my\r\nchambers.--A.  H."\r\n\r\nHe was so far successful;--but 10 P.M.: what an hour Sir Abraham had\r\nnamed for a legal interview!  Mr Harding felt perfectly sure that long\r\nbefore that Dr Grantly would be in London.  Dr Grantly could not,\r\nhowever, know that this interview had been arranged, nor could he\r\nlearn it unless he managed to get hold of Sir Abraham before that\r\nhour; and as this was very improbable, Mr Harding determined to\r\nstart from his hotel early, merely leaving word that he should dine\r\nout, and unless luck were much against him, he might still escape the\r\narchdeacon till his return from the attorney-general\'s chambers.\r\n\r\nHe was at breakfast at nine, and for the twentieth time consulted his\r\nBradshaw, to see at what earliest hour Dr Grantly could arrive from\r\nBarchester.  As he examined the columns, he was nearly petrified\r\nby the reflection that perhaps the archdeacon might come up by the\r\nnight-mail train!  His heart sank within him at the horrid idea,\r\nand for a moment he felt himself dragged back to Barchester without\r\naccomplishing any portion of his object.  Then he remembered that had\r\nDr Grantly done so, he would have been in the hotel, looking for him\r\nlong since.\r\n\r\n"Waiter," said he, timidly.\r\n\r\nThe waiter approached, creaking in his shoes, but voiceless.\r\n\r\n"Did any gentleman,--a clergyman, arrive here by the night-mail\r\ntrain?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir, not one," whispered the waiter, putting his mouth nearly\r\nclose to the warden\'s ear.\r\n\r\nMr Harding was reassured.\r\n\r\n"Waiter," said he again, and the waiter again creaked up.  "If anyone\r\ncalls for me, I am going to dine out, and shall return about eleven\r\no\'clock."\r\n\r\nThe waiter nodded, but did not this time vouchsafe any reply; and Mr\r\nHarding, taking up his hat, proceeded out to pass a long day in the\r\nbest way he could, somewhere out of sight of the archdeacon.\r\n\r\nBradshaw had told him twenty times that Dr Grantly could not be at\r\nPaddington station till 2 P.M., and our poor friend might therefore\r\nhave trusted to the shelter of the hotel for some hours longer with\r\nperfect safety; but he was nervous.  There was no knowing what steps\r\nthe archdeacon might take for his apprehension: a message by electric\r\ntelegraph might desire the landlord of the hotel to set a watch upon\r\nhim; some letter might come which he might find himself unable to\r\ndisobey; at any rate, he could not feel himself secure in any place\r\nat which the archdeacon could expect to find him; and at 10 A.M. he\r\nstarted forth to spend twelve hours in London.\r\n\r\nMr Harding had friends in town had he chosen to seek them; but he felt\r\nthat he was in no humour for ordinary calls, and he did not now wish\r\nto consult with anyone as to the great step which he had determined\r\nto take.  As he had said to his daughter, no one knows where the shoe\r\npinches but the wearer.  There are some points on which no man can be\r\ncontented to follow the advice of another,--some subjects on which\r\na man can consult his own conscience only.  Our warden had made up\r\nhis mind that it was good for him at any cost to get rid of this\r\ngrievance; his daughter was the only person whose concurrence appeared\r\nnecessary to him, and she did concur with him most heartily.  Under\r\nsuch circumstances he would not, if he could help it, consult anyone\r\nfurther, till advice would be useless.  Should the archdeacon catch\r\nhim, indeed, there would be much advice, and much consultation of a\r\nkind not to be avoided; but he hoped better things; and as he felt\r\nthat he could not now converse on indifferent subjects, he resolved\r\nto see no one till after his interview with the attorney-general.\r\n\r\nHe determined to take sanctuary in Westminster Abbey, so he again went\r\nthither in an omnibus, and finding that the doors were not open for\r\nmorning service, he paid his twopence, and went in as a sightseer.\r\nIt occurred to him that he had no definite place of rest for the day,\r\nand that he should be absolutely worn out before his interview if he\r\nattempted to walk about from 10 A.M. to 10 P.M., so he sat himself\r\ndown on a stone step, and gazed up at the figure of William Pitt, who\r\nlooks as though he had just entered the church for the first time in\r\nhis life and was anything but pleased at finding himself there.\r\n\r\nHe had been sitting unmolested about twenty minutes when the verger\r\nasked him whether he wouldn\'t like to walk round. Mr Harding didn\'t\r\nwant to walk anywhere, and declined, merely observing that he was\r\nwaiting for the morning service.  The verger, seeing that he was a\r\nclergyman, told him that the doors of the choir were now open, and\r\nshowed him into a seat.  This was a great point gained; the archdeacon\r\nwould certainly not come to morning service at Westminster Abbey, even\r\nthough he were in London; and here the warden could rest quietly, and,\r\nwhen the time came, duly say his prayers.\r\n\r\nHe longed to get up from his seat, and examine the music-books of the\r\nchoristers, and the copy of the litany from which the service was\r\nchanted, to see how far the little details at Westminster corresponded\r\nwith those at Barchester, and whether he thought his own voice would\r\nfill the church well from the Westminster precentor\'s seat.  There\r\nwould, however, be impropriety in such meddling, and he sat perfectly\r\nstill, looking up at the noble roof, and guarding against the coming\r\nfatigues of the day.\r\n\r\nBy degrees two or three people entered; the very same damp old woman\r\nwho had nearly obliterated him in the omnibus, or some other just like\r\nher; a couple of young ladies with their veils down, and gilt crosses\r\nconspicuous on their prayer-books; an old man on crutches; a party who\r\nwere seeing the abbey, and thought they might as well hear the service\r\nfor their twopence, as opportunity served; and a young woman with her\r\nprayer-book done up in her handkerchief, who rushed in late, and, in\r\nher hurried entry, tumbled over one of the forms, and made such a\r\nnoise that everyone, even the officiating minor canon, was startled,\r\nand she herself was so frightened by the echo of her own catastrophe\r\nthat she was nearly thrown into fits by the panic.\r\n\r\nMr Harding was not much edified by the manner of the service.  The\r\nminor canon in question hurried in, somewhat late, in a surplice not\r\nin the neatest order, and was followed by a dozen choristers, who were\r\nalso not as trim as they might have been: they all jostled into their\r\nplaces with a quick hurried step, and the service was soon commenced.\r\nSoon commenced and soon over,--for there was no music, and time was\r\nnot unnecessarily lost in the chanting.  On the whole Mr Harding was\r\nof opinion that things were managed better at Barchester, though even\r\nthere he knew that there was room for improvement.\r\n\r\nIt appears to us a question whether any clergyman can go through our\r\nchurch service with decorum, morning after morning, in an immense\r\nbuilding, surrounded by not more than a dozen listeners.  The best\r\nactors cannot act well before empty benches, and though there is, of\r\ncourse, a higher motive in one case than the other, still even the\r\nbest of clergymen cannot but be influenced by their audience; and to\r\nexpect that a duty should be well done under such circumstances, would\r\nbe to require from human nature more than human power.\r\n\r\nWhen the two ladies with the gilt crosses, the old man with his\r\ncrutch, and the still palpitating housemaid were going, Mr Harding\r\nfound himself obliged to go too.  The verger stood in his way, and\r\nlooked at him and looked at the door, and so he went.  But he returned\r\nagain in a few minutes, and re-entered with another twopence.  There\r\nwas no other sanctuary so good for him.\r\n\r\nAs he walked slowly down the nave, and then up one aisle, and then\r\nagain down the nave and up the other aisle, he tried to think gravely\r\nof the step he was about to take.  He was going to give up eight\r\nhundred a year voluntarily; and doom himself to live for the rest of\r\nhis life on about a hundred and fifty.  He knew that he had hitherto\r\nfailed to realise this fact as he ought to do.  Could he maintain\r\nhis own independence and support his daughter on a hundred and fifty\r\npounds a year without being a burden on anyone?  His son-in-law was\r\nrich, but nothing could induce him to lean on his son-in-law after\r\nacting, as he intended to do, in direct opposition to his son-in-law\'s\r\ncounsel.  The bishop was rich, but he was about to throw away the\r\nbishop\'s best gift, and that in a manner to injure materially the\r\npatronage of the giver: he could neither expect nor accept anything\r\nfurther from the bishop.  There would be not only no merit, but\r\npositive disgrace, in giving up his wardenship, if he were not\r\nprepared to meet the world without it.  Yes, he must from this time\r\nforward bound all his human wishes for himself and his daughter to\r\nthe poor extent of so limited an income.  He knew he had not thought\r\nsufficiently of this, that he had been carried away by enthusiasm,\r\nand had hitherto not brought home to himself the full reality of his\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nHe thought most about his daughter, naturally.  It was true that she\r\nwas engaged, and he knew enough of his proposed son-in-law to be sure\r\nthat his own altered circumstances would make no obstacle to such a\r\nmarriage; nay, he was sure that the very fact of his poverty would\r\ninduce Bold more anxiously to press the matter; but he disliked\r\ncounting on Bold in this emergency, brought on, as it had been, by\r\nhis doing.  He did not like saying to himself, Bold has turned me\r\nout of my house and income, and, therefore, he must relieve me of my\r\ndaughter; he preferred reckoning on Eleanor as the companion of his\r\npoverty and exile,--as the sharer of his small income.\r\n\r\nSome modest provision for his daughter had been long since made.  His\r\nlife was insured for three thousand pounds, and this sum was to go to\r\nEleanor.  The archdeacon, for some years past, had paid the premium,\r\nand had secured himself by the immediate possession of a small\r\nproperty which was to have gone to Mrs Grantly after her father\'s\r\ndeath.  This matter, therefore, had been taken out of the warden\'s\r\nhands long since, as, indeed, had all the business transactions of\r\nhis family, and his anxiety was, therefore, confined to his own life\r\nincome.\r\n\r\nYes.  A hundred and fifty per annum was very small, but still it might\r\nsuffice; but how was he to chant the litany at the cathedral on Sunday\r\nmornings, and get the service done at Crabtree Parva?  True, Crabtree\r\nChurch was not quite a mile and a half from the cathedral; but he\r\ncould not be in two places at once.  Crabtree was a small village,\r\nand afternoon service might suffice, but still this went against his\r\nconscience; it was not right that his parishioners should be robbed\r\nof any of their privileges on account of his poverty.  He might, to\r\nbe sure, make some arrangements for doing week-day service at the\r\ncathedral; but he had chanted the litany at Barchester so long, and\r\nhad a conscious feeling that he did it so well, that he was unwilling\r\nto give up the duty.\r\n\r\nThinking of such things, turning over in his own mind together small\r\ndesires and grave duties, but never hesitating for a moment as to the\r\nnecessity of leaving the hospital, Mr Harding walked up and down the\r\nabbey, or sat still meditating on the same stone step, hour after\r\nhour.  One verger went and another came, but they did not disturb him;\r\nevery now and then they crept up and looked at him, but they did so\r\nwith a reverential stare, and, on the whole, Mr Harding found his\r\nretreat well chosen.  About four o\'clock his comfort was disturbed\r\nby an enemy in the shape of hunger.  It was necessary that he should\r\ndine, and it was clear that he could not dine in the abbey: so he left\r\nhis sanctuary not willingly, and betook himself to the neighbourhood\r\nof the Strand to look for food.\r\n\r\nHis eyes had become so accustomed to the gloom of the church, that\r\nthey were dazed when he got out into the full light of day, and he\r\nfelt confused and ashamed of himself, as though people were staring at\r\nhim.  He hurried along, still in dread of the archdeacon, till he came\r\nto Charing Cross, and then remembered that in one of his passages\r\nthrough the Strand he had seen the words "Chops and Steaks" on a\r\nplacard in a shop window.  He remembered the shop distinctly; it was\r\nnext door to a trunk-seller\'s, and there was a cigar shop on the other\r\nside.  He couldn\'t go to his hotel for dinner, which to him hitherto\r\nwas the only known mode of dining in London at his own expense; and,\r\ntherefore, he would get a steak at the shop in the Strand.  Archdeacon\r\nGrantly would certainly not come to such a place for his dinner.\r\n\r\nHe found the house easily,--just as he had observed it, between the\r\ntrunks and the cigars.  He was rather daunted by the huge quantity\r\nof fish which he saw in the window.  There were barrels of oysters,\r\nhecatombs of lobsters, a few tremendous-looking crabs, and a tub full\r\nof pickled salmon; not, however, being aware of any connection between\r\nshell-fish and iniquity, he entered, and modestly asked a slatternly\r\nwoman, who was picking oysters out of a great watery reservoir,\r\nwhether he could have a mutton chop and a potato.\r\n\r\nThe woman looked somewhat surprised, but answered in the affirmative,\r\nand a slipshod girl ushered him into a long back room, filled with\r\nboxes for the accommodation of parties, in one of which he took his\r\nseat.  In a more miserably forlorn place he could not have found\r\nhimself: the room smelt of fish, and sawdust, and stale tobacco smoke,\r\nwith a slight taint of escaped gas; everything was rough and dirty,\r\nand disreputable; the cloth which they put before him was abominable;\r\nthe knives and forks were bruised, and hacked, and filthy; and\r\neverything was impregnated with fish.  He had one comfort, however:\r\nhe was quite alone; there was no one there to look on his dismay; nor\r\nwas it probable that anyone would come to do so.  It was a London\r\nsupper-house.  About one o\'clock at night the place would be lively\r\nenough, but at the present time his seclusion was as deep as it had\r\nbeen in the abbey.\r\n\r\nIn about half an hour the untidy girl, not yet dressed for her evening\r\nlabours, brought him his chop and potatoes, and Mr Harding begged for\r\na pint of sherry.  He was impressed with an idea, which was generally\r\nprevalent a few years since, and is not yet wholly removed from the\r\nminds of men, that to order a dinner at any kind of inn, without also\r\nordering a pint of wine for the benefit of the landlord, was a kind of\r\nfraud,--not punishable, indeed, by law, but not the less abominable\r\non that account.  Mr Harding remembered his coming poverty, and\r\nwould willingly have saved his half-crown, but he thought he had no\r\nalternative; and he was soon put in possession of some horrid mixture\r\nprocured from the neighbouring public-house.\r\n\r\nHis chop and potatoes, however, were eatable, and having got over\r\nas best he might the disgust created by the knives and forks, he\r\ncontrived to swallow his dinner.  He was not much disturbed: one\r\nyoung man, with pale face and watery fishlike eyes, wearing his hat\r\nominously on one side, did come in and stare at him, and ask the\r\ngirl, audibly enough, "Who that old cock was;" but the annoyance went\r\nno further, and the warden was left seated on his wooden bench in\r\npeace, endeavouring to distinguish the different scents arising from\r\nlobsters, oysters, and salmon.\r\n\r\nUnknowing as Mr Harding was in the ways of London, he felt that he had\r\nsomehow selected an ineligible dining-house, and that he had better\r\nleave it.  It was hardly five o\'clock;--how was he to pass the time\r\ntill ten?  Five miserable hours!  He was already tired, and it was\r\nimpossible that he should continue walking so long.  He thought of\r\ngetting into an omnibus, and going out to Fulham for the sake of\r\ncoming back in another: this, however, would be weary work, and as he\r\npaid his bill to the woman in the shop, he asked her if there were any\r\nplace near where he could get a cup of coffee.  Though she did keep a\r\nshellfish supper-house, she was very civil, and directed him to the\r\ncigar divan on the other side of the street.\r\n\r\nMr Harding had not a much correcter notion of a cigar divan than he\r\nhad of a London dinner-house, but he was desperately in want of rest,\r\nand went as he was directed.  He thought he must have made some\r\nmistake when he found himself in a cigar shop, but the man behind the\r\ncounter saw immediately that he was a stranger, and understood what he\r\nwanted.  "One shilling, sir,--thank ye, sir,--cigar, sir?--ticket for\r\ncoffee, sir;--you\'ll only have to call the waiter.  Up those stairs,\r\nif you please, sir.  Better take the cigar, sir,--you can always give\r\nit to a friend, you know.  Well, sir, thank ye, sir;--as you are so\r\ngood, I\'ll smoke it myself."  And so Mr Harding ascended to the divan,\r\nwith his ticket for coffee, but minus the cigar.\r\n\r\nThe place seemed much more suitable to his requirements than the\r\nroom in which he had dined: there was, to be sure, a strong smell of\r\ntobacco, to which he was not accustomed; but after the shell-fish, the\r\ntobacco did not seem disagreeable.  There were quantities of books,\r\nand long rows of sofas.  What on earth could be more luxurious than a\r\nsofa, a book, and a cup of coffee?  An old waiter came up to him, with\r\na couple of magazines and an evening paper.  Was ever anything so\r\ncivil?  Would he have a cup of coffee, or would he prefer sherbet?\r\nSherbet!  Was he absolutely in an Eastern divan, with the slight\r\naddition of all the London periodicals?  He had, however, an idea that\r\nsherbet should be drunk sitting cross-legged, and as he was not quite\r\nup to this, he ordered the coffee.\r\n\r\nThe coffee came, and was unexceptionable.  Why, this divan was a\r\nparadise!  The civil old waiter suggested to him a game of chess:\r\nthough a chess player he was not equal to this, so he declined, and,\r\nputting up his weary legs on the sofa, leisurely sipped his coffee,\r\nand turned over the pages of his Blackwood.  He might have been so\r\nengaged for about an hour, for the old waiter enticed him to a second\r\ncup of coffee, when a musical clock began to play.  Mr Harding then\r\nclosed his magazine, keeping his place with his finger, and lay,\r\nlistening with closed eyes to the clock.  Soon the clock seemed to\r\nturn into a violoncello, with piano accompaniments, and Mr Harding\r\nbegan to fancy the old waiter was the Bishop of Barchester; he was\r\ninexpressibly shocked that the bishop should have brought him his\r\ncoffee with his own hands; then Dr Grantly came in, with a basket full\r\nof lobsters, which he would not be induced to leave downstairs in the\r\nkitchen; and then the warden couldn\'t quite understand why so many\r\npeople would smoke in the bishop\'s drawing-room; and so he fell fast\r\nasleep, and his dreams wandered away to his accustomed stall in\r\nBarchester Cathedral, and the twelve old men he was so soon about to\r\nleave for ever.\r\n\r\nHe was fatigued, and slept soundly for some time.  Some sudden stop in\r\nthe musical clock woke him at length, and he jumped up with a start,\r\nsurprised to find the room quite full: it had been nearly empty when\r\nhis nap began.  With nervous anxiety he pulled out his watch, and\r\nfound that it was half-past nine.  He seized his hat, and, hurrying\r\ndownstairs, started at a rapid pace for Lincoln\'s Inn.\r\n\r\nIt still wanted twenty minutes to ten when the warden found himself\r\nat the bottom of Sir Abraham\'s stairs, so he walked leisurely up and\r\ndown the quiet inn to cool himself.  It was a beautiful evening at\r\nthe end of August.  He had recovered from his fatigue; his sleep and\r\nthe coffee had refreshed him, and he was surprised to find that he\r\nwas absolutely enjoying himself, when the inn clock struck ten.  The\r\nsound was hardly over before he knocked at Sir Abraham\'s door, and\r\nwas informed by the clerk who received him that the great man would\r\nbe with him immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII\r\n\r\nSIR ABRAHAM HAPHAZARD\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Harding was shown into a comfortable inner sitting-room, looking\r\nmore like a gentleman\'s book-room than a lawyer\'s chambers, and there\r\nwaited for Sir Abraham.  Nor was he kept waiting long: in ten or\r\nfifteen minutes he heard a clatter of voices speaking quickly in the\r\npassage, and then the attorney-general entered.\r\n\r\n"Very sorry to keep you waiting, Mr Warden," said Sir Abraham, shaking\r\nhands with him; "and sorry, too, to name so disagreeable an hour;\r\nbut your notice was short, and as you said to-day, I named the very\r\nearliest hour that was not disposed of."\r\n\r\nMr Harding assured him that he was aware that it was he that should\r\napologise.\r\n\r\nSir Abraham was a tall thin man, with hair prematurely gray, but\r\nbearing no other sign of age; he had a slight stoop, in his neck\r\nrather than his back, acquired by his constant habit of leaning\r\nforward as he addressed his various audiences.  He might be fifty\r\nyears old, and would have looked young for his age, had not constant\r\nwork hardened his features, and given him the appearance of a machine\r\nwith a mind.  His face was full of intellect, but devoid of natural\r\nexpression.  You would say he was a man to use, and then have done\r\nwith; a man to be sought for on great emergencies, but ill-adapted for\r\nordinary services; a man whom you would ask to defend your property,\r\nbut to whom you would be sorry to confide your love.  He was bright\r\nas a diamond, and as cutting, and also as unimpressionable.  He knew\r\neveryone whom to know was an honour, but he was without a friend; he\r\nwanted none, however, and knew not the meaning of the word in other\r\nthan its parliamentary sense.  A friend!  Had he not always been\r\nsufficient to himself, and now, at fifty, was it likely that he should\r\ntrust another?  He was married, indeed, and had children, but what\r\ntime had he for the soft idleness of conjugal felicity?  His working\r\ndays or term times were occupied from his time of rising to the late\r\nhour at which he went to rest, and even his vacations were more full\r\nof labour than the busiest days of other men.  He never quarrelled\r\nwith his wife, but he never talked to her;--he never had time to talk,\r\nhe was so taken up with speaking.  She, poor lady, was not unhappy;\r\nshe had all that money could give her, she would probably live to be\r\na peeress, and she really thought Sir Abraham the best of husbands.\r\n\r\nSir Abraham was a man of wit, and sparkled among the brightest at\r\nthe dinner-tables of political grandees: indeed, he always sparkled;\r\nwhether in society, in the House of Commons, or the courts of law,\r\ncoruscations flew from him; glittering sparkles, as from hot steel,\r\nbut no heat; no cold heart was ever cheered by warmth from him, no\r\nunhappy soul ever dropped a portion of its burden at his door.\r\n\r\nWith him success alone was praiseworthy, and he knew none so\r\nsuccessful as himself.  No one had thrust him forward; no powerful\r\nfriends had pushed him along on his road to power.  No; he was\r\nattorney-general, and would, in all human probability, be lord\r\nchancellor by sheer dint of his own industry and his own talent.  Who\r\nelse in all the world rose so high with so little help?  A premier,\r\nindeed!  Who had ever been premier without mighty friends?  An\r\narchbishop!  Yes, the son or grandson of a great noble, or else,\r\nprobably, his tutor.  But he, Sir Abraham, had had no mighty lord\r\nat his back; his father had been a country apothecary, his mother a\r\nfarmer\'s daughter.  Why should he respect any but himself?  And so he\r\nglitters along through the world, the brightest among the bright; and\r\nwhen his glitter is gone, and he is gathered to his fathers, no eye\r\nwill be dim with a tear, no heart will mourn for its lost friend.\r\n\r\n"And so, Mr Warden," said Sir Abraham, "all our trouble about this\r\nlawsuit is at an end."\r\n\r\nMr Harding said he hoped so, but he didn\'t at all understand what Sir\r\nAbraham meant.  Sir Abraham, with all his sharpness, could not have\r\nlooked into his heart and read his intentions.\r\n\r\n"All over.  You need trouble yourself no further about it; of course\r\nthey must pay the costs, and the absolute expense to you and Dr\r\nGrantly will be trifling,--that is, compared with what it might have\r\nbeen if it had been continued."\r\n\r\n"I fear I don\'t quite understand you, Sir Abraham."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know that their attorneys have noticed us that they have\r\nwithdrawn the suit?"\r\n\r\nMr Harding explained to the lawyer that he knew nothing of this,\r\nalthough he had heard in a roundabout way that such an intention had\r\nbeen talked of; and he also at length succeeded in making Sir Abraham\r\nunderstand that even this did not satisfy him.  The attorney-general\r\nstood up, put his hands into his breeches\' pockets, and raised his\r\neyebrows, as Mr Harding proceeded to detail the grievance from which\r\nhe now wished to rid himself.\r\n\r\n"I know I have no right to trouble you personally with this matter,\r\nbut as it is of most vital importance to me, as all my happiness is\r\nconcerned in it, I thought I might venture to seek your advice."\r\n\r\nSir Abraham bowed, and declared his clients were entitled to the best\r\nadvice he could give them; particularly a client so respectable in\r\nevery way as the Warden of Barchester Hospital.\r\n\r\n"A spoken word, Sir Abraham, is often of more value than volumes of\r\nwritten advice.  The truth is, I am ill-satisfied with this matter\r\nas it stands at present.  I do see--I cannot help seeing, that the\r\naffairs of the hospital are not arranged according to the will of the\r\nfounder."\r\n\r\n"None of such institutions are, Mr Harding, nor can they be; the\r\naltered circumstances in which we live do not admit of it."\r\n\r\n"Quite true--that is quite true; but I can\'t see that those altered\r\ncircumstances give me a right to eight hundred a year.  I don\'t know\r\nwhether I ever read John Hiram\'s will, but were I to read it now I\r\ncould not understand it.  What I want you, Sir Abraham, to tell me,\r\nis this:--am I, as warden, legally and distinctly entitled to the\r\nproceeds of the property, after the due maintenance of the twelve\r\nbedesmen?"\r\n\r\nSir Abraham declared that he couldn\'t exactly say in so many words\r\nthat Mr Harding was legally entitled to, &c., &c., &c., and ended in\r\nexpressing a strong opinion that it would be madness to raise any\r\nfurther question on the matter, as the suit was to be,--nay, was,\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nMr Harding, seated in his chair, began to play a slow tune on an\r\nimaginary violoncello.\r\n\r\n"Nay, my dear sir," continued the attorney-general, "there is no\r\nfurther ground for any question; I don\'t see that you have the power\r\nof raising it."\r\n\r\n"I can resign," said Mr Harding, slowly playing away with his right\r\nhand, as though the bow were beneath the chair in which he was\r\nsitting.\r\n\r\n"What! throw it up altogether?" said the attorney-general, gazing with\r\nutter astonishment at his client.\r\n\r\n"Did you see those articles in _The Jupiter_?" said Mr Harding,\r\npiteously, appealing to the sympathy of the lawyer.\r\n\r\nSir Abraham said he had seen them.  This poor little clergyman, cowed\r\ninto such an act of extreme weakness by a newspaper article, was to\r\nSir Abraham so contemptible an object, that he hardly knew how to talk\r\nto him as to a rational being.\r\n\r\n"Hadn\'t you better wait," said he, "till Dr Grantly is in town with\r\nyou?  Wouldn\'t it be better to postpone any serious step till you can\r\nconsult with him?"\r\n\r\nMr Harding declared vehemently that he could not wait, and Sir Abraham\r\nbegan seriously to doubt his sanity.\r\n\r\n"Of course," said the latter, "if you have private means sufficient\r\nfor your wants, and if this--"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t a sixpence, Sir Abraham," said the warden.\r\n\r\n"God bless me!  Why, Mr Harding, how do you mean to live?"\r\n\r\nMr Harding proceeded to explain to the man of law that he meant to\r\nkeep his precentorship,--that was eighty pounds a year; and, also,\r\nthat he meant to fall back upon his own little living of Crabtree,\r\nwhich was another eighty pounds.  That, to be sure, the duties of the\r\ntwo were hardly compatible; but perhaps he might effect an exchange.\r\nAnd then, recollecting that the attorney-general would hardly care to\r\nhear how the service of a cathedral church is divided among the minor\r\ncanons, stopped short in his explanations.\r\n\r\nSir Abraham listened in pitying wonder.  "I really think, Mr Harding,\r\nyou had better wait for the archdeacon.  This is a most serious\r\nstep,--one for which, in my opinion, there is not the slightest\r\nnecessity; and, as you have done me the honour of asking my advice, I\r\nmust implore you to do nothing without the approval of your friends.\r\nA man is never the best judge of his own position."\r\n\r\n"A man is the best judge of what he feels himself.  I\'d sooner beg my\r\nbread till my death than read such another article as those two that\r\nhave appeared, and feel, as I do, that the writer has truth on his\r\nside."\r\n\r\n"Have you not a daughter, Mr Harding--an unmarried daughter?"\r\n\r\n"I have," said he, now standing also, but still playing away on his\r\nfiddle with his hand behind his back.  "I have, Sir Abraham; and she\r\nand I are completely agreed on this subject."\r\n\r\n"Pray excuse me, Mr Harding, if what I say seems impertinent; but\r\nsurely it is you that should be prudent on her behalf.  She is young,\r\nand does not know the meaning of living on an income of a hundred and\r\nsixty pounds a year.  On her account give up this idea.  Believe me,\r\nit is sheer Quixotism."\r\n\r\nThe warden walked away to the window, and then back to his chair; and\r\nthen, irresolute what to say, took another turn to the window.  The\r\nattorney-general was really extremely patient, but he was beginning to\r\nthink that the interview had been long enough.\r\n\r\n"But if this income be not justly mine, what if she and I have both to\r\nbeg?" said the warden at last, sharply, and in a voice so different\r\nfrom that he had hitherto used, that Sir Abraham was startled.  "If\r\nso, it would be better to beg."\r\n\r\n"My dear sir, nobody now questions its justness."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Sir Abraham, one does question it,--the most important of all\r\nwitnesses against me;--I question it myself.  My God knows whether or\r\nno I love my daughter; but I would sooner that she and I should both\r\nbeg, than that she should live in comfort on money which is truly the\r\nproperty of the poor.  It may seem strange to you, Sir Abraham, it is\r\nstrange to myself, that I should have been ten years in that happy\r\nhome, and not have thought of these things till they were so roughly\r\ndinned into my ears.  I cannot boast of my conscience, when it\r\nrequired the violence of a public newspaper to awaken it; but, now\r\nthat it is awake, I must obey it.  When I came here, I did not know\r\nthat the suit was withdrawn by Mr Bold, and my object was to beg\r\nyou to abandon my defence.  As there is no action, there can be no\r\ndefence; but it is, at any rate, as well that you should know that\r\nfrom to-morrow I shall cease to be the warden of the hospital.  My\r\nfriends and I differ on this subject, Sir Abraham, and that adds much\r\nto my sorrow; but it cannot be helped."  And, as he finished what he\r\nhad to say, he played up such a tune as never before had graced the\r\nchambers of any attorney-general.  He was standing up, gallantly\r\nfronting Sir Abraham, and his right arm passed with bold and rapid\r\nsweeps before him, as though he were embracing some huge instrument,\r\nwhich allowed him to stand thus erect; and with the fingers of his\r\nleft hand he stopped, with preternatural velocity, a multitude of\r\nstrings, which ranged from the top of his collar to the bottom of\r\nthe lappet of his coat.  Sir Abraham listened and looked in wonder.\r\nAs he had never before seen Mr Harding, the meaning of these wild\r\ngesticulations was lost upon him; but he perceived that the gentleman\r\nwho had a few minutes since been so subdued as to be unable to speak\r\nwithout hesitation, was now impassioned,--nay, almost violent.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll sleep on this, Mr Harding, and to-morrow--"\r\n\r\n"I have done more than sleep upon it," said the warden; "I have lain\r\nawake upon it, and that night after night.  I found I could not sleep\r\nupon it: now I hope to do so."\r\n\r\nThe attorney-general had no answer to make to this; so he expressed\r\na quiet hope that whatever settlement was finally made would be\r\nsatisfactory; and Mr Harding withdrew, thanking the great man for\r\nhis kind attention.\r\n\r\nMr Harding was sufficiently satisfied with the interview to feel a\r\nglow of comfort as he descended into the small old square of Lincoln\'s\r\nInn.  It was a calm, bright, beautiful night, and by the light of\r\nthe moon, even the chapel of Lincoln\'s Inn, and the sombre row of\r\nchambers, which surround the quadrangle, looked well.  He stood still\r\na moment to collect his thoughts, and reflect on what he had done,\r\nand was about to do.  He knew that the attorney-general regarded him\r\nas little better than a fool, but that he did not mind; he and the\r\nattorney-general had not much in common between them; he knew also\r\nthat others, whom he did care about, would think so too; but Eleanor,\r\nhe was sure, would exult in what he had done, and the bishop, he\r\ntrusted, would sympathise with him.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime he had to meet the archdeacon, and so he walked slowly\r\ndown Chancery Lane and along Fleet Street, feeling sure that his work\r\nfor the night was not yet over.  When he reached the hotel he rang the\r\nbell quietly, and with a palpitating heart; he almost longed to escape\r\nround the corner, and delay the coming storm by a further walk round\r\nSt Paul\'s Churchyard, but he heard the slow creaking shoes of the old\r\nwaiter approaching, and he stood his ground manfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE WARDEN IS VERY OBSTINATE\r\n\r\n\r\n"Dr Grantly is here, sir," greeted his ears before the door was well\r\nopen, "and Mrs Grantly.  They have a sitting-room above, and are\r\nwaiting up for you."\r\n\r\nThere was something in the tone of the man\'s voice which seemed to\r\nindicate that even he looked upon the warden as a runaway schoolboy,\r\njust recaptured by his guardian, and that he pitied the culprit,\r\nthough he could not but be horrified at the crime.\r\n\r\nThe warden endeavoured to appear unconcerned, as he said, "Oh, indeed!\r\nI\'ll go upstairs at once;" but he failed signally.  There was,\r\nperhaps, a ray of comfort in the presence of his married daughter;\r\nthat is to say, of comparative comfort, seeing that his son-in-law\r\nwas there; but how much would he have preferred that they should both\r\nhave been safe at Plumstead Episcopi!  However, upstairs he went,\r\nthe waiter slowly preceding him; and on the door being opened the\r\narchdeacon was discovered standing in the middle of the room, erect,\r\nindeed, as usual, but oh! how sorrowful! and on the dingy sofa behind\r\nhim reclined his patient wife.\r\n\r\n"Papa, I thought you were never coming back," said the lady; "it\'s\r\ntwelve o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear," said the warden.  "The attorney-general named ten for\r\nmy meeting; to be sure ten is late, but what could I do, you know?\r\nGreat men will have their own way."\r\n\r\nAnd he gave his daughter a kiss, and shook hands with the doctor, and\r\nagain tried to look unconcerned.\r\n\r\n"And you have absolutely been with the attorney-general?" asked the\r\narchdeacon.\r\n\r\nMr Harding signified that he had.\r\n\r\n"Good heavens, how unfortunate!"  And the archdeacon raised his huge\r\nhands in the manner in which his friends are so accustomed to see him\r\nexpress disapprobation and astonishment.  "What will Sir Abraham think\r\nof it?  Did you not know that it is not customary for clients to go\r\ndirect to their counsel?"\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it?" asked the warden, innocently.  "Well, at any rate, I\'ve\r\ndone it now.  Sir Abraham didn\'t seem to think it so very strange."\r\n\r\nThe archdeacon gave a sigh that would have moved a man-of-war.\r\n\r\n"But, papa, what did you say to Sir Abraham?" asked the lady.\r\n\r\n"I asked him, my dear, to explain John Hiram\'s will to me.  He\r\ncouldn\'t explain it in the only way which would have satisfied me,\r\nand so I resigned the wardenship."\r\n\r\n"Resigned it!" said the archdeacon, in a solemn voice, sad and low,\r\nbut yet sufficiently audible,--a sort of whisper that Macready would\r\nhave envied, and the galleries have applauded with a couple of rounds.\r\n"Resigned it!  Good heavens!"  And the dignitary of the church sank\r\nback horrified into a horsehair arm-chair.\r\n\r\n"At least I told Sir Abraham that I would resign; and of course I must\r\nnow do so."\r\n\r\n"Not at all," said the archdeacon, catching a ray of hope.  "Nothing\r\nthat you say in such a way to your own counsel can be in any way\r\nbinding on you; of course you were there to ask his advice.  I\'m sure\r\nSir Abraham did not advise any such step."\r\n\r\nMr Harding could not say that he had.\r\n\r\n"I am sure he disadvised you from it," continued the reverend\r\ncross-examiner.\r\n\r\nMr Harding could not deny this.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure Sir Abraham must have advised you to consult your friends."\r\n\r\nTo this proposition also Mr Harding was obliged to assent.\r\n\r\n"Then your threat of resignation amounts to nothing, and we are just\r\nwhere we were before."\r\n\r\nMr Harding was now standing on the rug, moving uneasily from one foot\r\nto the other.  He made no distinct answer to the archdeacon\'s last\r\nproposition, for his mind was chiefly engaged on thinking how he could\r\nescape to bed.  That his resignation was a thing finally fixed on, a\r\nfact all but completed, was not in his mind a matter of any doubt; he\r\nknew his own weakness; he knew how prone he was to be led; but he was\r\nnot weak enough to give way now, to go back from the position to which\r\nhis conscience had driven him, after having purposely come to London\r\nto declare his determination: he did not in the least doubt his\r\nresolution, but he greatly doubted his power of defending it against\r\nhis son-in-law.\r\n\r\n"You must be very tired, Susan," said he: "wouldn\'t you like to go to\r\nbed?"\r\n\r\nBut Susan didn\'t want to go till her husband went.  She had an idea\r\nthat her papa might be bullied if she were away: she wasn\'t tired at\r\nall, or at least she said so.\r\n\r\nThe archdeacon was pacing the room, expressing, by certain nods of his\r\nhead, his opinion of the utter fatuity of his father-in-law.\r\n\r\n"Why," at last he said,--and angels might have blushed at the rebuke\r\nexpressed in his tone and emphasis,--"Why did you go off from\r\nBarchester so suddenly?  Why did you take such a step without giving\r\nus notice, after what had passed at the palace?"\r\n\r\nThe warden hung his head, and made no reply: he could not condescend\r\nto say that he had not intended to give his son-in-law the slip; and\r\nas he had not the courage to avow it, he said nothing.\r\n\r\n"Papa has been too much for you," said the lady.\r\n\r\nThe archdeacon took another turn, and again ejaculated, "Good\r\nheavens!" this time in a very low whisper, but still audible.\r\n\r\n"I think I\'ll go to bed," said the warden, taking up a side candle.\r\n\r\n"At any rate, you\'ll promise me to take no further step without\r\nconsultation," said the archdeacon.  Mr Harding made no answer, but\r\nslowly proceeded to light his candle.\r\n\r\n"Of course," continued the other, "such a declaration as that you made\r\nto Sir Abraham means nothing.  Come, warden, promise me this.  The\r\nwhole affair, you see, is already settled, and that with very little\r\ntrouble or expense.  Bold has been compelled to abandon his action,\r\nand all you have to do is to remain quiet at the hospital."  Mr\r\nHarding still made no reply, but looked meekly into his son-in-law\'s\r\nface.  The archdeacon thought he knew his father-in-law, but he was\r\nmistaken; he thought that he had already talked over a vacillating man\r\nto resign his promise.  "Come," said he, "promise Susan to give up\r\nthis idea of resigning the wardenship."\r\n\r\nThe warden looked at his daughter, thinking probably at the moment\r\nthat if Eleanor were contented with him, he need not so much regard\r\nhis other child, and said, "I am sure Susan will not ask me to break\r\nmy word, or to do what I know to be wrong."\r\n\r\n"Papa," said she, "it would be madness in you to throw up your\r\npreferment.  What are you to live on?"\r\n\r\n"God, that feeds the young ravens, will take care of me also," said Mr\r\nHarding, with a smile, as though afraid of giving offence by making\r\nhis reference to scripture too solemn.\r\n\r\n"Pish!" said the archdeacon, turning away rapidly.  "If the ravens\r\npersisted in refusing the food prepared for them, they wouldn\'t be\r\nfed."  A clergyman generally dislikes to be met in argument by any\r\nscriptural quotation; he feels as affronted as a doctor does, when\r\nrecommended by an old woman to take some favourite dose, or as a\r\nlawyer when an unprofessional man attempts to put him down by a\r\nquibble.\r\n\r\n"I shall have the living of Crabtree," modestly suggested the warden.\r\n\r\n"Eighty pounds a year!" sneered the archdeacon.\r\n\r\n"And the precentorship," said the father-in-law.\r\n\r\n"It goes with the wardenship," said the son-in-law.  Mr Harding was\r\nprepared to argue this point, and began to do so, but Dr Grantly\r\nstopped him.  "My dear warden," said he, "this is all nonsense.\r\nEighty pounds or a hundred and sixty makes very little difference.\r\nYou can\'t live on it,--you can\'t ruin Eleanor\'s prospects for ever.\r\nIn point of fact, you can\'t resign; the bishop wouldn\'t accept it;\r\nthe whole thing is settled.  What I now want to do is to prevent any\r\ninconvenient tittle-tattle,--any more newspaper articles."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I want, too," said the warden.\r\n\r\n"And to prevent that," continued the other, "we mustn\'t let any talk\r\nof resignation get abroad."\r\n\r\n"But I shall resign," said the warden, very, very meekly.\r\n\r\n"Good heavens!  Susan, my dear, what can I say to him?"\r\n\r\n"But, papa," said Mrs Grantly, getting up, and putting her arm through\r\nthat of her father, "what is Eleanor to do if you throw away your\r\nincome?"\r\n\r\nA hot tear stood in each of the warden\'s eyes as he looked round upon\r\nhis married daughter.  Why should one sister who was so rich predict\r\npoverty for another?  Some such idea as this was on his mind, but he\r\ngave no utterance to it.  Then he thought of the pelican feeding its\r\nyoung with blood from its own breast, but he gave no utterance to\r\nthat either; and then of Eleanor waiting for him at home, waiting to\r\ncongratulate him on the end of all his trouble.\r\n\r\n"Think of Eleanor, papa," said Mrs Grantly.\r\n\r\n"I do think of her," said her father.\r\n\r\n"And you will not do this rash thing?"  The lady was really moved\r\nbeyond her usual calm composure.\r\n\r\n"It can never be rash to do right," said he.  "I shall certainly\r\nresign this wardenship."\r\n\r\n"Then, Mr Harding, there is nothing before you but ruin," said the\r\narchdeacon, now moved beyond all endurance.  "Ruin both for you and\r\nEleanor.  How do you mean to pay the monstrous expenses of this\r\naction?"\r\n\r\nMrs Grantly suggested that, as the action was abandoned, the costs\r\nwould not be heavy.\r\n\r\n"Indeed they will, my dear," continued he.  "One cannot have the\r\nattorney-general up at twelve o\'clock at night for nothing;--but of\r\ncourse your father has not thought of this."\r\n\r\n"I will sell my furniture," said the warden.\r\n\r\n"Furniture!" ejaculated the other, with a most powerful sneer.\r\n\r\n"Come, archdeacon," said the lady, "we needn\'t mind that at present.\r\nYou know you never expected papa to pay the costs."\r\n\r\n"Such absurdity is enough to provoke Job," said the archdeacon,\r\nmarching quickly up and down the room.  "Your father is like a child.\r\nEight hundred pounds a year!--eight hundred and eighty with the\r\nhouse,--with nothing to do.  The very place for him.  And to throw\r\nthat up because some scoundrel writes an article in a newspaper!\r\nWell;--I have done my duty.  If he chooses to ruin his child I cannot\r\nhelp it;" and he stood still at the fire-place, and looked at himself\r\nin a dingy mirror which stood on the chimney-piece.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause for about a minute, and then the warden, finding\r\nthat nothing else was coming, lighted his candle, and quietly said,\r\n"Good-night."\r\n\r\n"Good-night, papa," said the lady.\r\n\r\nAnd so the warden retired; but, as he closed the door behind him, he\r\nheard the well-known ejaculation,--slower, lower, more solemn, more\r\nponderous than ever,--"Good heavens!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIX\r\n\r\nTHE WARDEN RESIGNS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe party met the next morning at breakfast; and a very sombre affair\r\nit was,--very unlike the breakfasts at Plumstead Episcopi.\r\n\r\nThere were three thin, small, dry bits of bacon, each an inch long,\r\nserved up under a huge old plated cover; there were four three-cornered\r\nbits of dry toast, and four square bits of buttered toast; there was\r\na loaf of bread, and some oily-looking butter; and on the sideboard\r\nthere were the remains of a cold shoulder of mutton.  The archdeacon,\r\nhowever, had not come up from his rectory to St Paul\'s Churchyard to\r\nenjoy himself, and therefore nothing was said of the scanty fare.\r\n\r\nThe guests were as sorry as the viands;--hardly anything was said over\r\nthe breakfast-table.  The archdeacon munched his toast in ominous\r\nsilence, turning over bitter thoughts in his deep mind.  The warden\r\ntried to talk to his daughter, and she tried to answer him; but they\r\nboth failed.  There were no feelings at present in common between\r\nthem.  The warden was thinking only of getting back to Barchester, and\r\ncalculating whether the archdeacon would expect him to wait for him;\r\nand Mrs Grantly was preparing herself for a grand attack which she was\r\nto make on her father, as agreed upon between herself and her husband\r\nduring their curtain confabulation of that morning.\r\n\r\nWhen the waiter had creaked out of the room with the last of the\r\nteacups, the archdeacon got up and went to the window as though to\r\nadmire the view.  The room looked out on a narrow passage which runs\r\nfrom St Paul\'s Churchyard to Paternoster Row; and Dr Grantly patiently\r\nperused the names of the three shopkeepers whose doors were in view.\r\nThe warden still kept his seat at the table, and examined the pattern\r\nof the tablecloth; and Mrs Grantly, seating herself on the sofa, began\r\nto knit.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the warden pulled his Bradshaw out of his pocket, and\r\nbegan laboriously to consult it.  There was a train for Barchester at\r\n10 A.M.  That was out of the question, for it was nearly ten already.\r\nAnother at 3 P.M.; another, the night-mail train, at 9 P.M.  The three\r\no\'clock train would take him home to tea, and would suit very well.\r\n\r\n"My dear," said he, "I think I shall go back home at three o\'clock\r\nto-day.  I shall get home at half-past eight.  I don\'t think there\'s\r\nanything to keep me in London."\r\n\r\n"The archdeacon and I return by the early train to-morrow, papa; won\'t\r\nyou wait and go back with us?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Eleanor will expect me tonight; and I\'ve so much to do; and--"\r\n\r\n"Much to do!" said the archdeacon sotto voce; but the warden heard\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"You\'d better wait for us, papa."\r\n\r\n"Thank ye, my dear!  I think I\'ll go this afternoon."  The tamest\r\nanimal will turn when driven too hard, and even Mr Harding was\r\nbeginning to fight for his own way.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you won\'t be back before three?" said the lady, addressing\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\n"I must leave this at two," said the warden.\r\n\r\n"Quite out of the question," said the archdeacon, answering his wife,\r\nand still reading the shopkeepers\' names; "I don\'t suppose I shall be\r\nback till five."\r\n\r\nThere was another long pause, during which Mr Harding continued to\r\nstudy his Bradshaw.\r\n\r\n"I must go to Cox and Cummins," said the archdeacon at last.\r\n\r\n"Oh, to Cox and Cummins," said the warden.  It was quite a matter of\r\nindifference to him where his son-in-law went.  The names of Cox and\r\nCummins had now no interest in his ears.  What had he to do with Cox\r\nand Cummins further, having already had his suit finally adjudicated\r\nupon in a court of conscience, a judgment without power of appeal\r\nfully registered, and the matter settled so that all the lawyers in\r\nLondon could not disturb it.  The archdeacon could go to Cox and\r\nCummins, could remain there all day in anxious discussion; but what\r\nmight be said there was no longer matter of interest to him, who was\r\nso soon to lay aside the name of warden of Barchester Hospital.\r\n\r\nThe archdeacon took up his shining new clerical hat, and put on his\r\nblack new clerical gloves, and looked heavy, respectable, decorous,\r\nand opulent, a decided clergyman of the Church of England, every\r\ninch of him.  "I suppose I shall see you at Barchester the day after\r\nto-morrow," said he.\r\n\r\nThe warden supposed he would.\r\n\r\n"I must once more beseech you to take no further steps till you see my\r\nfather; if you owe me nothing," and the archdeacon looked as though he\r\nthought a great deal were due to him, "at least you owe so much to my\r\nfather;" and, without waiting for a reply, Dr Grantly wended his way\r\nto Cox and Cummins.\r\n\r\nMrs Grantly waited till the last fall of her husband\'s foot was heard,\r\nas he turned out of the court into St Paul\'s Churchyard, and then\r\ncommenced her task of talking her father over.\r\n\r\n"Papa," she began, "this is a most serious business."\r\n\r\n"Indeed it is," said the warden, ringing the bell.\r\n\r\n"I greatly feel the distress of mind you must have endured."\r\n\r\n"I am sure you do, my dear;"--and he ordered the waiter to bring him\r\npen, ink, and paper.\r\n\r\n"Are you going to write, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear;--I am going to write my resignation to the bishop."\r\n\r\n"Pray, pray, papa, put it off till our return;--pray put it off till\r\nyou have seen the bishop;--dear papa! for my sake, for Eleanor\'s!--"\r\n\r\n"It is for your sake and Eleanor\'s that I do this.  I hope, at least,\r\nthat my children may never have to be ashamed of their father."\r\n\r\n"How can you talk about shame, papa?" and she stopped while the waiter\r\ncreaked in with the paper, and then slowly creaked out again; "how can\r\nyou talk about shame? you know what all your friends think about this\r\nquestion."\r\n\r\nThe warden spread his paper on the table, placing it on the\r\nmeagre blotting-book which the hotel afforded, and sat himself\r\ndown to write.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t refuse me one request, papa?" continued his\r\ndaughter; "you won\'t refuse to delay your letter for two short\r\ndays?  Two days can make no possible difference."\r\n\r\n"My dear," said he na\xefvely, "if I waited till I got to Barchester, I\r\nmight, perhaps, be prevented."\r\n\r\n"But surely you would not wish to offend the bishop?" said she.\r\n\r\n"God forbid!  The bishop is not apt to take offence, and knows me too\r\nwell to take in bad part anything that I may be called on to do."\r\n\r\n"But, papa--"\r\n\r\n"Susan," said he, "my mind on this subject is made up; it is not\r\nwithout much repugnance that I act in opposition to the advice of such\r\nmen as Sir Abraham Haphazard and the archdeacon; but in this matter\r\nI can take no advice, I cannot alter the resolution to which I have\r\ncome."\r\n\r\n"But two days, papa--"\r\n\r\n"No;--nor can I delay it.  You may add to my present unhappiness by\r\npressing me, but you cannot change my purpose; it will be a comfort\r\nto me if you will let the matter rest": and, dipping his pen into the\r\ninkstand, he fixed his eyes intently on the paper.\r\n\r\nThere was something in his manner which taught his daughter to\r\nperceive that he was in earnest; she had at one time ruled supreme in\r\nher father\'s house, but she knew that there were moments when, mild\r\nand meek as he was, he would have his way, and the present was an\r\noccasion of the sort.  She returned, therefore, to her knitting, and\r\nvery shortly after left the room.\r\n\r\nThe warden was now at liberty to compose his letter, and, as it was\r\ncharacteristic of the man, it shall be given at full length.  The\r\nofficial letter, which, when written, seemed to him to be too formally\r\ncold to be sent alone to so dear a friend, was accompanied by a\r\nprivate note; and both are here inserted.\r\n\r\nThe letter of resignation ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                       CHAPTER HOTEL, ST.  PAUL\'s,\r\n                       LONDON,\r\n                       August, 18--\r\n\r\n   My LORD BISHOP,\r\n\r\n\r\n   It is with the greatest pain that I feel myself constrained\r\n   to resign into your Lordship\'s hands the wardenship of the\r\n   hospital at Barchester, which you so kindly conferred upon\r\n   me, now nearly twelve years since.\r\n\r\n   I need not explain the circumstances which have made this\r\n   step appear necessary to me.  You are aware that a question\r\n   has arisen as to the right of the warden to the income which\r\n   has been allotted to the wardenship; it has seemed to me\r\n   that this right is not well made out, and I hesitate to\r\n   incur the risk of taking an income to which my legal claim\r\n   appears doubtful.\r\n\r\n   The office of precentor of the cathedral is, as your\r\n   Lordship is aware, joined to that of the warden; that is to\r\n   say, the precentor has for many years been the warden of the\r\n   hospital; there is, however, nothing to make the junction of\r\n   the two offices necessary, and, unless you or the dean and\r\n   chapter object to such an arrangement, I would wish to keep\r\n   the precentorship.  The income of this office will now be\r\n   necessary to me; indeed, I do not know why I should be\r\n   ashamed to say that I should have difficulty in supporting\r\n   myself without it.\r\n\r\n   Your Lordship, and such others as you may please to consult\r\n   on the matter, will at once see that my resignation of\r\n   the wardenship need offer not the slightest bar to its\r\n   occupation by another person.  I am thought in the wrong by\r\n   all those whom I have consulted in the matter; I have very\r\n   little but an inward and an unguided conviction of my own\r\n   to bring me to this step, and I shall, indeed, be hurt to\r\n   find that any slur is thrown on the preferment which your\r\n   kindness bestowed on me, by my resignation of it.  I, at\r\n   any rate for one, shall look on any successor whom you may\r\n   appoint as enjoying a clerical situation of the highest\r\n   respectability, and one to which your Lordship\'s nomination\r\n   gives an indefeasible right.\r\n\r\n   I cannot finish this official letter without again thanking\r\n   your Lordship for all your great kindness, and I beg to\r\n   subscribe myself--\r\n\r\n   Your Lordship\'s most obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                       SEPTIMUS HARDING,\r\n\r\n                       Warden of Barchester Hospital,\r\n                       and Precentor of the Cathedral.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe then wrote the following private note:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   My DEAR BISHOP,\r\n\r\n   I cannot send you the accompanying official letter without\r\n   a warmer expression of thanks for all your kindness than\r\n   would befit a document which may to a certain degree be\r\n   made public.  You, I know, will understand the feeling,\r\n   and, perhaps, pity the weakness which makes me resign\r\n   the hospital.  I am not made of calibre strong enough to\r\n   withstand public attack.  Were I convinced that I stood\r\n   on ground perfectly firm, that I was certainly justified\r\n   in taking eight hundred a year under Hiram\'s will, I\r\n   should feel bound by duty to retain the position, however\r\n   unendurable might be the nature of the assault; but, as I\r\n   do not feel this conviction, I cannot believe that you will\r\n   think me wrong in what I am doing.\r\n\r\n   I had at one time an idea of keeping only some moderate\r\n   portion of the income; perhaps three hundred a year, and of\r\n   remitting the remainder to the trustees; but it occurred to\r\n   me, and I think with reason, that by so doing I should place\r\n   my successors in an invidious position, and greatly damage\r\n   your patronage.\r\n\r\n   My dear friend, let me have a line from you to say that\r\n   you do not blame me for what I am doing, and that the\r\n   officiating vicar of Crabtree Parva will be the same to\r\n   you as the warden of the hospital.\r\n\r\n   I am very anxious about the precentorship: the archdeacon\r\n   thinks it must go with the wardenship; I think not, and,\r\n   that, having it, I cannot be ousted.  I will, however, be\r\n   guided by you and the dean.  No other duty will suit me so\r\n   well, or come so much within my power of adequate\r\n   performance.\r\n\r\n   I thank you from my heart for the preferment which I am now\r\n   giving up, and for all your kindness, and am, dear bishop,\r\n   now as always--\r\n\r\n                       Yours most sincerely,\r\n                       SEPTIMUS HARDING\r\n\r\n   LONDON,--AUGUST, 18--\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving written these letters and made a copy of the former one for the\r\nbenefit of the archdeacon, Mr Harding, whom we must now cease to call\r\nthe warden, he having designated himself so for the last time, found\r\nthat it was nearly two o\'clock, and that he must prepare for his\r\njourney.  Yes, from this time he never again admitted the name by\r\nwhich he had been so familiarly known, and in which, to tell the\r\ntruth, he had rejoiced.  The love of titles is common to all men,\r\nand a vicar or fellow is as pleased at becoming Mr Archdeacon or\r\nMr Provost, as a lieutenant at getting his captaincy, or a city\r\ntallow-chandler in becoming Sir John on the occasion of a Queen\'s\r\nvisit to a new bridge.  But warden he was no longer, and the name of\r\nprecentor, though the office was to him so dear, confers in itself\r\nno sufficient distinction; our friend, therefore, again became Mr\r\nHarding.\r\n\r\nMrs Grantly had gone out; he had, therefore, no one to delay him by\r\nfurther entreaties to postpone his journey; he had soon arranged his\r\nbag, and paid his bill, and, leaving a note for his daughter, in which\r\nhe put the copy of his official letter, he got into a cab and drove\r\naway to the station with something of triumph in his heart.\r\n\r\nHad he not cause for triumph?  Had he not been supremely successful?\r\nHad he not for the first time in his life held his own purpose\r\nagainst that of his son-in-law, and manfully combated against great\r\nodds,--against the archdeacon\'s wife as well as the archdeacon?  Had\r\nhe not gained a great victory, and was it not fit that he should step\r\ninto his cab with triumph?\r\n\r\nHe had not told Eleanor when he would return, but she was on the\r\nlook-out for him by every train by which he could arrive, and the\r\npony-carriage was at the Barchester station when the train drew up\r\nat the platform.\r\n\r\n"My dear," said he, sitting beside her, as she steered her little\r\nvessel to one side of the road to make room for the clattering omnibus\r\nas they passed from the station into the town, "I hope you\'ll be able\r\nto feel a proper degree of respect for the vicar of Crabtree."\r\n\r\n"Dear papa," said she, "I am so glad."\r\n\r\nThere was great comfort in returning home to that pleasant house,\r\nthough he was to leave it so soon, and in discussing with his daughter\r\nall that he had done, and all that he had to do.  It must take some\r\ntime to get out of one house into another; the curate at Crabtree\r\ncould not be abolished under six months, that is, unless other\r\nprovision could be made for him; and then the furniture:--the most of\r\nthat must be sold to pay Sir Abraham Haphazard for sitting up till\r\ntwelve at night.  Mr Harding was strangely ignorant as to lawyers\'\r\nbills; he had no idea, from twenty pounds to two thousand, as to the\r\nsum in which he was indebted for legal assistance.  True, he had\r\ncalled in no lawyer himself; true, he had been no consenting party to\r\nthe employment of either Cox and Cummins, or Sir Abraham; he had never\r\nbeen consulted on such matters;--the archdeacon had managed all this\r\nhimself, never for a moment suspecting that Mr Harding would take upon\r\nhim to end the matter in a way of his own.  Had the lawyers\' bills\r\nbeen ten thousand pounds, Mr Harding could not have helped it; but\r\nhe was not on that account disposed to dispute his own liability.\r\nThe question never occurred to him; but it did occur to him that he\r\nhad very little money at his banker\'s, that he could receive nothing\r\nfurther from the hospital, and that the sale of the furniture was his\r\nonly resource.\r\n\r\n"Not all, papa," said Eleanor pleadingly.\r\n\r\n"Not quite all, my dear," said he; "that is, if we can help it. We\r\nmust have a little at Crabtree,--but it can only be a little; we\r\nmust put a bold front on it, Nelly; it isn\'t easy to come down from\r\naffluence to poverty."\r\n\r\nAnd so they planned their future mode of life; the father taking\r\ncomfort from the reflection that his daughter would soon be freed from\r\nit, and she resolving that her father would soon have in her own house\r\na ready means of escape from the solitude of the Crabtree vicarage.\r\n\r\nWhen the archdeacon left his wife and father-in-law at the Chapter\r\nCoffee House to go to Messrs Cox and Cummins, he had no very defined\r\nidea of what he had to do when he got there.  Gentlemen when at law,\r\nor in any way engaged in matters requiring legal assistance, are very\r\napt to go to their lawyers without much absolute necessity;--gentlemen\r\nwhen doing so, are apt to describe such attendance as quite\r\ncompulsory, and very disagreeable.  The lawyers, on the other hand,\r\ndo not at all see the necessity, though they quite agree as to the\r\ndisagreeable nature of the visit;--gentlemen when so engaged are\r\nusually somewhat gravelled at finding nothing to say to their learned\r\nfriends; they generally talk a little politics, a little weather, ask\r\nsome few foolish questions about their suit, and then withdraw, having\r\npassed half an hour in a small dingy waiting-room, in company with\r\nsome junior assistant-clerk, and ten minutes with the members of the\r\nfirm; the business is then over for which the gentleman has come up\r\nto London, probably a distance of a hundred and fifty miles. To be\r\nsure he goes to the play, and dines at his friend\'s club, and has a\r\nbachelor\'s liberty and bachelor\'s recreation for three or four days;\r\nand he could not probably plead the desire of such gratifications as\r\na reason to his wife for a trip to London.\r\n\r\nMarried ladies, when your husbands find they are positively obliged to\r\nattend their legal advisers, the nature of the duty to be performed is\r\ngenerally of this description.\r\n\r\nThe archdeacon would not have dreamt of leaving London without going\r\nto Cox and Cummins; and yet he had nothing to say to them.  The game\r\nwas up; he plainly saw that Mr Harding in this matter was not to be\r\nmoved; his only remaining business on this head was to pay the bill\r\nand have done with it; and I think it may be taken for granted,\r\nthat whatever the cause may be that takes a gentleman to a lawyer\'s\r\nchambers, he never goes there to pay his bill.\r\n\r\nDr Grantly, however, in the eyes of Messrs Cox and Cummins,\r\nrepresented the spiritualities of the diocese of Barchester, as Mr\r\nChadwick did the temporalities, and was, therefore, too great a man to\r\nundergo the half-hour in the clerk\'s room.  It will not be necessary\r\nthat we should listen to the notes of sorrow in which the archdeacon\r\nbewailed to Mr Cox the weakness of his father-in-law, and the end\r\nof all their hopes of triumph; nor need we repeat the various\r\nexclamations of surprise with which the mournful intelligence was\r\nreceived.  No tragedy occurred, though Mr Cox, a short and somewhat\r\nbull-necked man, was very near a fit of apoplexy when he first\r\nattempted to ejaculate that fatal word--resign!\r\n\r\nOver and over again did Mr Cox attempt to enforce on the archdeacon\r\nthe propriety of urging on Mr Warden the madness of the deed he was\r\nabout to do.\r\n\r\n"Eight hundred a year!" said Mr Cox.\r\n\r\n"And nothing whatever to do!" said Mr Cummins, who had joined the\r\nconference.\r\n\r\n"No private fortune, I believe," said Mr Cox.\r\n\r\n"Not a shilling," said Mr Cummins, in a very low voice, shaking his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n"I never heard of such a case in all my experience," said Mr Cox.\r\n\r\n"Eight hundred a year, and as nice a house as any gentleman could wish\r\nto hang up his hat in," said Mr Cummins.\r\n\r\n"And an unmarried daughter, I believe," said Mr Cox, with much moral\r\nseriousness in his tone.  The archdeacon only sighed as each separate\r\nwail was uttered, and shook his head, signifying that the fatuity of\r\nsome people was past belief.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what he might do," said Mr Cummins, brightening up.\r\n"I\'ll tell you how you might save it:--let him exchange."\r\n\r\n"Exchange where?" said the archdeacon.\r\n\r\n"Exchange for a living.  There\'s Quiverful, of Puddingdale;--he has\r\ntwelve children, and would be delighted to get the hospital.  To\r\nbe sure Puddingdale is only four hundred, but that would be saving\r\nsomething out of the fire: Mr Harding would have a curate, and still\r\nkeep three hundred or three hundred and fifty."\r\n\r\nThe archdeacon opened his ears and listened; he really thought the\r\nscheme might do.\r\n\r\n"The newspapers," continued Mr Cummins, "might hammer away at\r\nQuiverful every day for the next six months without his minding\r\nthem."\r\n\r\nThe archdeacon took up his hat, and returned to his hotel, thinking\r\nthe matter over deeply.  At any rate he would sound Quiverful.  A man\r\nwith twelve children would do much to double his income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XX\r\n\r\nFAREWELL\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning after Mr Harding\'s return home he received a note from\r\nthe bishop full of affection, condolence, and praise.  "Pray come to\r\nme at once," wrote the bishop, "that we may see what had better be\r\ndone; as to the hospital, I will not say a word to dissuade you; but I\r\ndon\'t like your going to Crabtree: at any rate, come to me at once."\r\n\r\nMr Harding did go to him at once; and long and confidential was the\r\nconsultation between the two old friends.  There they sat together\r\nthe whole long day, plotting to get the better of the archdeacon, and\r\nto carry out little schemes of their own, which they knew would be\r\nopposed by the whole weight of his authority.\r\n\r\nThe bishop\'s first idea was, that Mr Harding, if left to himself,\r\nwould certainly starve,--not in the figurative sense in which so many\r\nof our ladies and gentlemen do starve on incomes from one to five\r\nhundred a year; not that he would be starved as regarded dress coats,\r\nport wine, and pocket-money; but that he would positively perish of\r\ninanition for want of bread.\r\n\r\n"How is a man to live, when he gives up all his income?" said the\r\nbishop to himself.  And then the good-natured little man began to\r\nconsider how his friend might be best rescued from a death so horrid\r\nand painful.\r\n\r\nHis first proposition to Mr Harding was, that they should live\r\ntogether at the palace.  He, the bishop, positively assured Mr Harding\r\nthat he wanted another resident chaplain,--not a young working\r\nchaplain, but a steady, middle-aged chaplain; one who would dine and\r\ndrink a glass of wine with him, talk about the archdeacon, and poke\r\nthe fire.  The bishop did not positively name all these duties, but\r\nhe gave Mr Harding to understand that such would be the nature of the\r\nservice required.\r\n\r\nIt was not without much difficulty that Mr Harding made his friend see\r\nthat this would not suit him; that he could not throw up the bishop\'s\r\npreferment, and then come and hang on at the bishop\'s table; that he\r\ncould not allow people to say of him that it was an easy matter to\r\nabandon his own income, as he was able to sponge on that of another\r\nperson.  He succeeded, however, in explaining that the plan would not\r\ndo, and then the bishop brought forward another which he had in his\r\nsleeve.  He, the bishop, had in his will left certain moneys to Mr\r\nHarding\'s two daughters, imagining that Mr Harding would himself want\r\nno such assistance during his own lifetime.  This legacy amounted to\r\nthree thousand pounds each, duty free; and he now pressed it as a gift\r\non his friend.\r\n\r\n"The girls, you know," said he, "will have it just the same when\r\nyou\'re gone,--and they won\'t want it sooner;--and as for the interest\r\nduring my lifetime, it isn\'t worth talking about.  I have more than\r\nenough."\r\n\r\nWith much difficulty and heartfelt sorrow, Mr Harding refused also\r\nthis offer.  No; his wish was to support himself, however poorly,--not\r\nto be supported on the charity of anyone.  It was hard to make the\r\nbishop understand this; it was hard to make him comprehend that\r\nthe only real favour he could confer was the continuation of his\r\nindependent friendship; but at last even this was done.  At any rate,\r\nthought the bishop, he will come and dine with me from time to time,\r\nand if he be absolutely starving I shall see it.\r\n\r\nTouching the precentorship, the bishop was clearly of opinion that it\r\ncould be held without the other situation,--an opinion from which no\r\none differed; and it was therefore soon settled among all the parties\r\nconcerned, that Mr Harding should still be the precentor of the\r\ncathedral.\r\n\r\nOn the day following Mr Harding\'s return, the archdeacon reached\r\nPlumstead full of Mr Cummins\'s scheme regarding Puddingdale and Mr\r\nQuiverful.  On the very next morning he drove over to Puddingdale,\r\nand obtained the full consent of the wretched clerical Priam, who was\r\nendeavouring to feed his poor Hecuba and a dozen of Hectors on the\r\nsmall proceeds of his ecclesiastical kingdom.  Mr Quiverful had no\r\ndoubts as to the legal rights of the warden; his conscience would be\r\nquite clear as to accepting the income; and as to _The Jupiter_, he\r\nbegged to assure the archdeacon that he was quite indifferent to any\r\nemanations from the profane portion of the periodical press.\r\n\r\nHaving so far succeeded, he next sounded the bishop; but here he was\r\nastonished by most unexpected resistance.  The bishop did not think\r\nit would do.  "Not do, why not?" and seeing that his father was not\r\nshaken, he repeated the question in a severer form: "Why not do, my\r\nlord?"\r\n\r\nHis lordship looked very unhappy, and shuffled about in his chair,\r\nbut still didn\'t give way; he thought Puddingdale wouldn\'t do for Mr\r\nHarding; it was too far from Barchester.\r\n\r\n"Oh! of course he\'ll have a curate."\r\n\r\nThe bishop also thought that Mr Quiverful wouldn\'t do for the\r\nhospital; such an exchange wouldn\'t look well at such a time; and,\r\nwhen pressed harder, he declared he didn\'t think Mr Harding would\r\naccept of Puddingdale under any circumstances.\r\n\r\n"How is he to live?" demanded the archdeacon.\r\n\r\nThe bishop, with tears in his eyes, declared that he had not the\r\nslightest conception how life was to be sustained within him at all.\r\n\r\nThe archdeacon then left his father, and went down to the hospital;\r\nbut Mr Harding wouldn\'t listen at all to the Puddingdale scheme.  To\r\nhis eyes it had no attraction; it savoured of simony, and was likely\r\nto bring down upon him harder and more deserved strictures than any he\r\nhad yet received: he positively declined to become vicar of\r\nPuddingdale under any circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe archdeacon waxed wroth, talked big, and looked bigger; he said\r\nsomething about dependence and beggary, spoke of the duty every man\r\nwas under to earn his bread, made passing allusions to the follies of\r\nyouth and waywardness of age, as though Mr Harding were afflicted by\r\nboth, and ended by declaring that he had done.  He felt that he had\r\nleft no stone unturned to arrange matters on the best and easiest\r\nfooting; that he had, in fact, so arranged them, that he had so\r\nmanaged that there was no further need of any anxiety in the matter.\r\nAnd how had he been paid?  His advice had been systematically\r\nrejected; he had been not only slighted, but distrusted and avoided;\r\nhe and his measures had been utterly thrown over, as had been Sir\r\nAbraham, who, he had reason to know, was much pained at what had\r\noccurred.  He now found it was useless to interfere any further, and\r\nhe should retire.  If any further assistance were required from him,\r\nhe would probably be called on, and should be again happy to come\r\nforward.  And so he left the hospital, and has not since entered it\r\nfrom that day to this.\r\n\r\nAnd here we must take leave of Archdeacon Grantly.  We fear that he is\r\nrepresented in these pages as being worse than he is; but we have had\r\nto do with his foibles, and not with his virtues.  We have seen only\r\nthe weak side of the man, and have lacked the opportunity of bringing\r\nhim forward on his strong ground.  That he is a man somewhat too fond\r\nof his own way, and not sufficiently scrupulous in his manner of\r\nachieving it, his best friends cannot deny.  That he is bigoted in\r\nfavour, not so much of his doctrines as of his cloth, is also true:\r\nand it is true that the possession of a large income is a desire that\r\nsits near his heart.  Nevertheless, the archdeacon is a gentleman and\r\na man of conscience; he spends his money liberally, and does the work\r\nhe has to do with the best of his ability; he improves the tone of\r\nsociety of those among whom he lives.  His aspirations are of a\r\nhealthy, if not of the highest, kind.  Though never an austere man,\r\nhe upholds propriety of conduct both by example and precept.  He\r\nis generous to the poor, and hospitable to the rich; in matters of\r\nreligion he is sincere, and yet no Pharisee; he is in earnest, and yet\r\nno fanatic.  On the whole, the Archdeacon of Barchester is a man doing\r\nmore good than harm,--a man to be furthered and supported, though\r\nperhaps also to be controlled; and it is matter of regret to us that\r\nthe course of our narrative has required that we should see more of\r\nhis weakness than his strength.\r\n\r\nMr Harding allowed himself no rest till everything was prepared for\r\nhis departure from the hospital.  It may be as well to mention that he\r\nwas not driven to the stern necessity of selling all his furniture: he\r\nhad been quite in earnest in his intention to do so, but it was soon\r\nmade known to him that the claims of Messrs Cox and Cummins made no\r\nsuch step obligatory.  The archdeacon had thought it wise to make use\r\nof the threat of the lawyer\'s bill, to frighten his father-in-law into\r\ncompliance; but he had no intention to saddle Mr Harding with costs,\r\nwhich had been incurred by no means exclusively for his benefit.\r\nThe amount of the bill was added to the diocesan account, and was,\r\nin fact, paid out of the bishop\'s pocket, without any consciousness\r\non the part of his lordship.  A great part of his furniture he did\r\nresolve to sell, having no other means to dispose of it; and the\r\nponies and carriage were transferred, by private contract, to the use\r\nof an old maiden lady in the city.\r\n\r\nFor his present use Mr Harding took a lodging in Barchester, and\r\nthither were conveyed such articles as he wanted for daily use:--his\r\nmusic, books, and instruments, his own arm-chair, and Eleanor\'s pet\r\nsofa; her teapoy and his cellaret, and also the slender but still\r\nsufficient contents of his wine-cellar.  Mrs Grantly had much wished\r\nthat her sister would reside at Plumstead, till her father\'s house\r\nat Crabtree should be ready for her; but Eleanor herself strongly\r\nresisted this proposal.  It was in vain urged upon her, that a lady\r\nin lodgings cost more than a gentleman; and that, under her father\'s\r\npresent circumstances, such an expense should be avoided.  Eleanor had\r\nnot pressed her father to give up the hospital in order that she might\r\nlive at Plumstead Rectory and he alone in his Barchester lodgings;\r\nnor did Eleanor think that she would be treating a certain gentleman\r\nvery fairly, if she betook herself to the house which he would be the\r\nleast desirous of entering of any in the county.  So she got a little\r\nbedroom for herself behind the sitting-room, and just over the little\r\nback parlour of the chemist, with whom they were to lodge.  There was\r\nsomewhat of a savour of senna softened by peppermint about the place;\r\nbut, on the whole, the lodgings were clean and comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe day had been fixed for the migration of the ex-warden, and all\r\nBarchester were in a state of excitement on the subject.  Opinion\r\nwas much divided as to the propriety of Mr Harding\'s conduct.  The\r\nmercantile part of the community, the mayor and corporation, and\r\ncouncil, also most of the ladies, were loud in his praise.  Nothing\r\ncould be more noble, nothing more generous, nothing more upright.\r\nBut the gentry were of a different way of thinking,--especially the\r\nlawyers and the clergymen.  They said such conduct was very weak and\r\nundignified; that Mr Harding evinced a lamentable want of _esprit de\r\ncorps_, as well as courage; and that such an abdication must do much\r\nharm, and could do but little good.\r\n\r\nOn the evening before he left, he summoned all the bedesmen into his\r\nparlour to wish them good-bye.  With Bunce he had been in frequent\r\ncommunication since his return from London, and had been at much\r\npains to explain to the old man the cause of his resignation, without\r\nin any way prejudicing the position of his successor.  The others,\r\nalso, he had seen more or less frequently; and had heard from most of\r\nthem separately some expression of regret at his departure; but he had\r\npostponed his farewell till the last evening.\r\n\r\nHe now bade the maid put wine and glasses on the table; and had the\r\nchairs arranged around the room; and sent Bunce to each of the men to\r\nrequest they would come and say farewell to their late warden.  Soon\r\nthe noise of aged scuffling feet was heard upon the gravel and in the\r\nlittle hall, and the eleven men who were enabled to leave their rooms\r\nwere assembled.\r\n\r\n"Come in, my friends, come in," said the warden;--he was still warden\r\nthen.  "Come in, and sit down;" and he took the hand of Abel Handy,\r\nwho was the nearest to him, and led the limping grumbler to a chair.\r\nThe others followed slowly and bashfully; the infirm, the lame, and\r\nthe blind: poor wretches! who had been so happy, had they but known\r\nit!  Now their aged faces were covered with shame, and every kind word\r\nfrom their master was a coal of fire burning on their heads.\r\n\r\nWhen first the news had reached them that Mr Harding was going to\r\nleave the hospital, it had been received with a kind of triumph;--his\r\ndeparture was, as it were, a prelude to success.  He had admitted his\r\nwant of right to the money about which they were disputing; and as it\r\ndid not belong to him, of course, it did to them.  The one hundred a\r\nyear to each of them was actually becoming a reality; and Abel Handy\r\nwas a hero, and Bunce a faint-hearted sycophant, worthy neither honour\r\nnor fellowship.  But other tidings soon made their way into the old\r\nmen\'s rooms.  It was first notified to them that the income abandoned\r\nby Mr Harding would not come to them; and these accounts were\r\nconfirmed by attorney Finney.  They were then informed that Mr\r\nHarding\'s place would be at once filled by another.  That the new\r\nwarden could not be a kinder man they all knew; that he would be a\r\nless friendly one most suspected; and then came the bitter information\r\nthat, from the moment of Mr Harding\'s departure, the twopence a day,\r\nhis own peculiar gift, must of necessity be withdrawn.\r\n\r\nAnd this was to be the end of all their mighty struggle,--of their\r\nfight for their rights,--of their petition, and their debates, and\r\ntheir hopes!  They were to change the best of masters for a possible\r\nbad one, and to lose twopence a day each man!  No; unfortunate as this\r\nwas, it was not the worst, or nearly the worst, as will just now be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\n"Sit down, sit down, my friends," said the warden; "I want to say a\r\nword to you and to drink your healths, before I leave you.  Come up\r\nhere, Moody, here is a chair for you; come, Jonathan Crumple;"--and by\r\ndegrees he got the men to be seated.  It was not surprising that they\r\nshould hang back with faint hearts, having returned so much kindness\r\nwith such deep ingratitude.  Last of all of them came Bunce, and with\r\nsorrowful mien and slow step got into his accustomed seat near the\r\nfire-place.\r\n\r\nWhen they were all in their places, Mr Harding rose to address them;\r\nand then finding himself not quite at home on his legs, he sat down\r\nagain.  "My dear old friends," said he, "you all know that I am going\r\nto leave you."\r\n\r\nThere was a sort of murmur ran round the room, intended, perhaps, to\r\nexpress regret at his departure; but it was but a murmur, and might\r\nhave meant that or anything else.\r\n\r\n"There has been lately some misunderstanding between us. You have\r\nthought, I believe, that you did not get all that you were entitled\r\nto, and that the funds of the hospital have not been properly disposed\r\nof.  As for me, I cannot say what should be the disposition of these\r\nmoneys, or how they should be managed, and I have therefore thought it\r\nbest to go."\r\n\r\n"We never wanted to drive your reverence out of it," said Handy.\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, your reverence," said Skulpit.  "We never thought it\r\nwould come to this.  When I signed the petition,--that is, I didn\'t\r\nsign it, because--"\r\n\r\n"Let his reverence speak, can\'t you?" said Moody.\r\n\r\n"No," continued Mr Harding; "I am sure you did not wish to turn me\r\nout; but I thought it best to leave you.  I am not a very good hand at\r\na lawsuit, as you may all guess; and when it seemed necessary that our\r\nordinary quiet mode of living should be disturbed, I thought it better\r\nto go.  I am neither angry nor offended with any man in the hospital."\r\n\r\nHere Bunce uttered a kind of groan, very clearly expressive of\r\ndisagreement.\r\n\r\n"I am neither angry nor displeased with any man in the hospital,"\r\nrepeated Mr Harding, emphatically.  "If any man has been wrong,--and\r\nI don\'t say any man has,--he has erred through wrong advice.  In this\r\ncountry all are entitled to look for their own rights, and you have\r\ndone no more.  As long as your interests and my interests were at\r\nvariance, I could give you no counsel on this subject; but the\r\nconnection between us has ceased; my income can no longer depend on\r\nyour doings, and therefore, as I leave you, I venture to offer to you\r\nmy advice."\r\n\r\nThe men all declared that they would from henceforth be entirely\r\nguided by Mr Harding\'s opinion in their affairs.\r\n\r\n"Some gentleman will probably take my place here very soon, and I\r\nstrongly advise you to be prepared to receive him in a kindly spirit\r\nand to raise no further question among yourselves as to the amount of\r\nhis income.  Were you to succeed in lessening what he has to receive,\r\nyou would not increase your own allowance.  The surplus would not go\r\nto you; your wants are adequately provided for, and your position\r\ncould hardly be improved."\r\n\r\n"God bless your reverence, we knows it," said Spriggs.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all true, your reverence," said Skulpit.  "We sees it all now."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr Harding," said Bunce, opening his mouth for the first time;\r\n"I believe they do understand it now, now that they\'ve driven from\r\nunder the same roof with them such a master as not one of them will\r\never know again,--now that they\'re like to be in sore want of a\r\nfriend."\r\n\r\n"Come, come, Bunce," said Mr Harding, blowing his nose and manoeuvring\r\nto wipe his eyes at the same time.\r\n\r\n"Oh, as to that," said Handy, "we none of us never wanted to do Mr\r\nHarding no harm; if he\'s going now, it\'s not along of us; and I don\'t\r\nsee for what Mr Bunce speaks up agen us that way."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve ruined yourselves, and you\'ve ruined me too, and that\'s why,"\r\nsaid Bunce.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, Bunce," said Mr Harding; "there\'s nobody ruined at all.\r\nI hope you\'ll let me leave you all friends; I hope you\'ll all drink\r\na glass of wine in friendly feeling with me and with one another.\r\nYou\'ll have a good friend, I don\'t doubt, in your new warden; and if\r\never you want any other, why after all I\'m not going so far off but\r\nthat I shall sometimes see you;" and then, having finished his speech,\r\nMr Harding filled all the glasses, and himself handed each a glass to\r\nthe men round him, and raising his own said:--\r\n\r\n"God bless you all! you have my heartfelt wishes for your welfare.\r\nI hope you may live contented, and die trusting in the Lord Jesus\r\nChrist, and thankful to Almighty God for the good things he has given\r\nyou.  God bless you, my friends!" and Mr Harding drank his wine.\r\n\r\nAnother murmur, somewhat more articulate than the first, passed round\r\nthe circle, and this time it was intended to imply a blessing on Mr\r\nHarding.  It had, however, but little cordiality in it.  Poor old\r\nmen! how could they be cordial with their sore consciences and shamed\r\nfaces? how could they bid God bless him with hearty voices and a true\r\nbenison, knowing, as they did, that their vile cabal had driven him\r\nfrom his happy home, and sent him in his old age to seek shelter under\r\na strange roof-tree?  They did their best, however; they drank their\r\nwine, and withdrew.\r\n\r\nAs they left the hall-door, Mr Harding shook hands with each of the\r\nmen, and spoke a kind word to them about their individual cases and\r\nailments; and so they departed, answering his questions in the fewest\r\nwords, and retreated to their dens, a sorrowful repentant crew.\r\n\r\nAll but Bunce, who still remained to make his own farewell.  "There\'s\r\npoor old Bell," said Mr Harding; "I mustn\'t go without saying a word\r\nto him; come through with me, Bunce, and bring the wine with you;"\r\nand so they went through to the men\'s cottages, and found the old man\r\npropped up as usual in his bed.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve come to say good-bye to you, Bell," said Mr Harding, speaking\r\nloud, for the old man was deaf.\r\n\r\n"And are you going away, then, really?" asked Bell.\r\n\r\n"Indeed I am, and I\'ve brought you a glass of wine; so that we may\r\npart friends, as we lived, you know."\r\n\r\nThe old man took the proffered glass in his shaking hands, and drank\r\nit eagerly.  "God bless you, Bell!" said Mr Harding; "good-bye, my old\r\nfriend."\r\n\r\n"And so you\'re really going?" the man again asked.\r\n\r\n"Indeed I am, Bell."\r\n\r\nThe poor old bed-ridden creature still kept Mr Harding\'s hand in his\r\nown, and the warden thought that he had met with something like warmth\r\nof feeling in the one of all his subjects from whom it was the least\r\nlikely to be expected; for poor old Bell had nearly outlived all human\r\nfeelings.  "And your reverence," said he, and then he paused, while\r\nhis old palsied head shook horribly, and his shrivelled cheeks sank\r\nlower within his jaws, and his glazy eye gleamed with a momentary\r\nlight; "and your reverence, shall we get the hundred a year, then?"\r\n\r\nHow gently did Mr Harding try to extinguish the false hope of money\r\nwhich had been so wretchedly raised to disturb the quiet of the dying\r\nman!  One other week and his mortal coil would be shuffled off; in\r\none short week would God resume his soul, and set it apart for its\r\nirrevocable doom; seven more tedious days and nights of senseless\r\ninactivity, and all would be over for poor Bell in this world; and\r\nyet, with his last audible words, he was demanding his moneyed rights,\r\nand asserting himself to be the proper heir of John Hiram\'s bounty!\r\nNot on him, poor sinner as he was, be the load of such sin!\r\n\r\nMr Harding returned to his parlour, meditating with a sick heart\r\non what he had seen, and Bunce with him.  We will not describe the\r\nparting of these two good men, for good men they were.  It was in\r\nvain that the late warden endeavoured to comfort the heart of the old\r\nbedesman; poor old Bunce felt that his days of comfort were gone.  The\r\nhospital had to him been a happy home, but it could be so no longer.\r\nHe had had honour there, and friendship; he had recognised his master,\r\nand been recognised; all his wants, both of soul and body, had been\r\nsupplied, and he had been a happy man.  He wept grievously as he\r\nparted from his friend, and the tears of an old man are bitter.\r\n"It is all over for me in this world," said he, as he gave the last\r\nsqueeze to Mr Harding\'s hand; "I have now to forgive those who have\r\ninjured me;--and to die."\r\n\r\nAnd so the old man went out, and then Mr Harding gave way to his grief\r\nand he too wept aloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXI\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nOur tale is now done, and it only remains to us to collect the\r\nscattered threads of our little story, and to tie them into a seemly\r\nknot.  This will not be a work of labour, either to the author or\r\nto his readers; we have not to deal with many personages, or with\r\nstirring events, and were it not for the custom of the thing, we might\r\nleave it to the imagination of all concerned to conceive how affairs\r\nat Barchester arranged themselves.\r\n\r\nOn the morning after the day last alluded to, Mr Harding, at an early\r\nhour, walked out of the hospital, with his daughter under his arm, and\r\nsat down quietly to breakfast at his lodgings over the chemist\'s shop.\r\nThere was no parade about his departure; no one, not even Bunce, was\r\nthere to witness it; had he walked to the apothecary\'s thus early to\r\nget a piece of court plaster, or a box of lozenges, he could not have\r\ndone it with less appearance of an important movement.  There was a\r\ntear in Eleanor\'s eye as she passed through the big gateway and over\r\nthe bridge; but Mr Harding walked with an elastic step, and entered\r\nhis new abode with a pleasant face.\r\n\r\n"Now, my dear," said he, "you have everything ready, and you can\r\nmake tea here just as nicely as in the parlour at the hospital."  So\r\nEleanor took off her bonnet and made the tea.  After this manner did\r\nthe late Warden of Barchester Hospital accomplish his flitting, and\r\nchange his residence.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the archdeacon brought his father to discuss\r\nthe subject of a new warden.  Of course he looked upon the nomination\r\nas his own, and he had in his eye three or four fitting candidates,\r\nseeing that Mr Cummins\'s plan as to the living of Puddingdale could\r\nnot be brought to bear.  How can I describe the astonishment which\r\nconfounded him, when his father declared that he would appoint no\r\nsuccessor to Mr Harding?  "If we can get the matter set to rights, Mr\r\nHarding will return," said the bishop; "and if we cannot, it will be\r\nwrong to put any other gentleman into so cruel a position."\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that the archdeacon argued and lectured, and even\r\nthreatened; in vain he my-lorded his poor father in his sternest\r\nmanner; in vain his "good heavens!" were ejaculated in a tone that\r\nmight have moved a whole synod, let alone one weak and aged bishop.\r\nNothing could induce his father to fill up the vacancy caused by Mr\r\nHarding\'s retirement.\r\n\r\nEven John Bold would have pitied the feelings with which the\r\narchdeacon returned to Plumstead: the church was falling, nay, already\r\nin ruins; its dignitaries were yielding without a struggle before the\r\nblows of its antagonists; and one of its most respected bishops, his\r\nown father,--the man considered by all the world as being in such\r\nmatters under his, Dr Grantly\'s, control,--had positively resolved to\r\ncapitulate, and own himself vanquished!\r\n\r\nAnd how fared the hospital under this resolve of its visitor?  Badly\r\nindeed.  It is now some years since Mr Harding left it, and the\r\nwarden\'s house is still tenantless.  Old Bell has died, and Billy\r\nGazy; the one-eyed Spriggs has drunk himself to death, and three\r\nothers of the twelve have been gathered into the churchyard mould.\r\nSix have gone, and the six vacancies remain unfilled!  Yes, six have\r\ndied, with no kind friend to solace their last moments, with no\r\nwealthy neighbour to administer comforts and ease the stings of death.\r\nMr Harding, indeed, did not desert them; from him they had such\r\nconsolation as a dying man may receive from his Christian pastor; but\r\nit was the occasional kindness of a stranger which ministered to them,\r\nand not the constant presence of a master, a neighbour, and a friend.\r\n\r\nNor were those who remained better off than those who died.\r\nDissensions rose among them, and contests for pre-eminence; and\r\nthen they began to understand that soon one among them would be the\r\nlast,--some one wretched being would be alone there in that now\r\ncomfortless hospital,--the miserable relic of what had once been so\r\ngood and so comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe building of the hospital itself has not been allowed to go to\r\nruins.  Mr Chadwick, who still holds his stewardship, and pays the\r\naccruing rents into an account opened at a bank for the purpose, sees\r\nto that; but the whole place has become disordered and ugly.  The\r\nwarden\'s garden is a wretched wilderness, the drive and paths are\r\ncovered with weeds, the flower-beds are bare, and the unshorn lawn is\r\nnow a mass of long damp grass and unwholesome moss.  The beauty of the\r\nplace is gone; its attractions have withered.  Alas! a very few years\r\nsince it was the prettiest spot in Barchester, and now it is a\r\ndisgrace to the city.\r\n\r\nMr Harding did not go out to Crabtree Parva.  An arrangement was made\r\nwhich respected the homestead of Mr Smith and his happy family, and\r\nput Mr Harding into possession of a small living within the walls of\r\nthe city.  It is the smallest possible parish, containing a part of\r\nthe Cathedral Close and a few old houses adjoining.  The church is a\r\nsingular little Gothic building, perched over a gateway, through which\r\nthe Close is entered, and is approached by a flight of stone steps\r\nwhich leads down under the archway of the gate.  It is no bigger\r\nthan an ordinary room,--perhaps twenty-seven feet long by eighteen\r\nwide,--but still it is a perfect church.  It contains an old carved\r\npulpit and reading-desk, a tiny altar under a window filled with dark\r\nold-coloured glass, a font, some half-dozen pews, and perhaps a dozen\r\nseats for the poor; and also a vestry.  The roof is high pitched, and\r\nof black old oak, and the three large beams which support it run down\r\nto the side walls, and terminate in grotesquely carved faces,--two\r\ndevils and an angel on one side, two angels and a devil on the other.\r\nSuch is the church of St Cuthbert at Barchester, of which Mr Harding\r\nbecame rector, with a clear income of seventy-five pounds a year.\r\n\r\nHere he performs afternoon service every Sunday, and administers the\r\nSacrament once in every three months.  His audience is not large; and,\r\nhad they been so, he could not have accommodated them: but enough come\r\nto fill his six pews, and on the front seat of those devoted to the\r\npoor is always to be seen our old friend Mr Bunce, decently arrayed in\r\nhis bedesman\'s gown.\r\n\r\nMr Harding is still precentor of Barchester; and it is very rarely\r\nthe case that those who attend the Sunday morning service miss the\r\ngratification of hearing him chant the Litany, as no other man in\r\nEngland can do it.  He is neither a discontented nor an unhappy\r\nman; he still inhabits the lodgings to which he went on leaving the\r\nhospital, but he now has them to himself.  Three months after that\r\ntime Eleanor became Mrs Bold, and of course removed to her husband\'s\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThere were some difficulties to be got over on the occasion of the\r\nmarriage.  The archdeacon, who could not so soon overcome his grief,\r\nwould not be persuaded to grace the ceremony with his presence, but he\r\nallowed his wife and children to be there.  The marriage took place\r\nin the cathedral, and the bishop himself officiated.  It was the last\r\noccasion on which he ever did so; and, though he still lives, it is\r\nnot probable that he will ever do so again.\r\n\r\nNot long after the marriage, perhaps six months, when Eleanor\'s\r\nbridal-honours were fading, and persons were beginning to call her Mrs\r\nBold without twittering, the archdeacon consented to meet John Bold at\r\na dinner-party, and since that time they have become almost friends.\r\nThe archdeacon firmly believes that his brother-in-law was, as a\r\nbachelor, an infidel, an unbeliever in the great truths of our\r\nreligion; but that matrimony has opened his eyes, as it has those of\r\nothers.  And Bold is equally inclined to think that time has softened\r\nthe asperities of the archdeacon\'s character.  Friends though they\r\nare, they do not often revert to the feud of the hospital.\r\n\r\nMr Harding, we say, is not an unhappy man: he keeps his lodgings, but\r\nthey are of little use to him, except as being the one spot on earth\r\nwhich he calls his own.  His time is spent chiefly at his daughter\'s\r\nor at the palace; he is never left alone, even should he wish to be\r\nso; and within a twelvemonth of Eleanor\'s marriage his determination\r\nto live at his own lodging had been so far broken through and\r\nabandoned, that he consented to have his violoncello permanently\r\nremoved to his daughter\'s house.\r\n\r\nEvery other day a message is brought to him from the bishop.  "The\r\nbishop\'s compliments, and his lordship is not very well to-day, and\r\nhe hopes Mr Harding will dine with him."  This bulletin as to the old\r\nman\'s health is a myth; for though he is over eighty he is never ill,\r\nand will probably die some day, as a spark goes out, gradually and\r\nwithout a struggle.  Mr Harding does dine with him very often, which\r\nmeans going to the palace at three and remaining till ten; and\r\nwhenever he does not the bishop whines, and says that the port wine is\r\ncorked, and complains that nobody attends to him, and frets himself\r\noff to bed an hour before his time.\r\n\r\nIt was long before the people of Barchester forgot to call Mr Harding\r\nby his long well-known name of Warden.  It had become so customary to\r\nsay Mr Warden, that it was not easily dropped.  "No, no," he always\r\nsays when so addressed, "not warden now, only precentor."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WARDEN***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 619-8.txt or 619-8.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/6/1/619\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
